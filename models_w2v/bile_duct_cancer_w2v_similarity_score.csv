Impact of intraoperative radiation on postoperative and disease-specific outcome after pancreatoduodenectomy for adenocarcinoma: a propensity score analysis.,American journal of clinical oncology,Am. J. Clin. Oncol.,2003-02-01,"For periampullary cancer,intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) administered to the site with the highest locoregional recurrence risk carries the rationale to improve tumor control. An IORT effect on survival remains unclear. IORT impact on postoperative outcomes after pancreatectomy for adenocarcinoma was analyzed, with a specific attempt to correct for the nonrandom IORT treatment assignment, and to account for treatment group imbalances in the interpretation of outcome differences. A propensity-score-adjusted analysis, based on variable selection by logistic regression, was used to rebalance treatments. Between 1989 and 1999, 61 patients underwent partial or total pancreatectomy for a primary periampullary adenocarcinoma at the City of Hope National Medical Center. Diagnoses included pancreatic (n = 36), duodenal (n = 11), ampullary (n = 10), and bile duct cancer (n = 4). Thirty patients received IORT to the resection area, with a median dose of 15 Gy (range: 10-20), followed by postoperative external beam radiation (n = 24). Mortality was 0%, the complication rate 61%. Of 33 patients with a documented recurrence, 6 had an isolated locoregional recurrence only (1 IORT versus 5 no IORT, = 0.05); the systemic recurrence pattern differed as well (IORT 94%, no IORT 67%; = 0.04). IORT had no significant impact on hospital stay (overall median: 17 days), disease-free survival (16 months), and overall survival (23 months) when adjusted for those most relevant variables reflecting IORT treatment group assignment propensity. After adjustment for relevant propensity factors, IORT was not linked to a significantly increased risk for complications, hospital stay, or survival hazard. The recurrence pattern may be affected in some patients, but systemic recurrences predominate. We continue to explore IORT in combination with systemic chemotherapy.",Journal Article,6198.0,23.0,For periampullary cancer intraoperative radiation therapy IORT administered to the site with the highest locoregional recurrence risk carries the rationale to improve tumor control An IORT effect on survival remains unclear IORT impact on postoperative outcomes after pancreatectomy for adenocarcinoma was analyzed with a specific attempt to correct for the nonrandom IORT treatment assignment and to account for treatment group imbalances in the interpretation of outcome differences A propensity-score-adjusted analysis based on variable selection by logistic regression was used to rebalance treatments Between 1989 and 1999 61 patients underwent partial or total pancreatectomy for a primary periampullary adenocarcinoma at the City of Hope National Medical Center Diagnoses included n 36 duodenal n 11 ampullary n 10 and duct cancer n 4 Thirty patients received IORT to the resection area with a median dose of 15 Gy range 10-20 followed by postoperative external beam radiation n 24 Mortality was 0 the complication rate 61 Of 33 patients with a documented recurrence 6 had an isolated locoregional recurrence only 1 IORT versus 5 no IORT 0.05 the systemic recurrence pattern differed as well IORT 94 no IORT 67 0.04 IORT had no significant impact on hospital stay overall median 17 days disease-free survival 16 months and overall survival 23 months when adjusted for those most relevant variables reflecting IORT treatment group assignment propensity After adjustment for relevant propensity factors IORT was not linked to a significantly increased risk for complications hospital stay or survival hazard The recurrence pattern may be affected in some patients but systemic recurrences predominate We continue to explore IORT in combination with systemic chemotherapy,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[9, 9180, 12, 1720, 121, 36, 4158, 468, 6, 3, 606, 5, 3, 1076, 1325, 146, 43, 4942, 3, 1728, 6, 401, 30, 182, 35, 4158, 254, 23, 25, 469, 1200, 4158, 345, 23, 573, 123, 50, 3762, 9, 449, 10, 311, 5, 8, 112, 3448, 6, 4883, 9, 3, 12480, 4158, 24, 4392, 2, 6, 1967, 9, 24, 87, 10143, 4, 3, 3037, 1, 228, 362, 8, 1925, 368, 586, 65, 90, 23, 1347, 881, 20, 812, 320, 10, 95, 6, 43166, 640, 59, 3965, 2, 2043, 713, 7, 208, 450, 15, 181, 3762, 9, 8, 86, 9180, 449, 28, 3, 7235, 1, 3045, 657, 484, 574, 2403, 159, 78, 511, 4748, 78, 175, 6762, 78, 79, 2, 2920, 12, 78, 39, 977, 7, 103, 4158, 6, 3, 170, 965, 5, 8, 52, 61, 1, 167, 381, 184, 79, 179, 370, 20, 573, 1455, 1345, 121, 78, 259, 282, 10, 13, 3, 1447, 116, 713, 1, 466, 7, 5, 8, 1405, 146, 49, 42, 35, 1355, 1325, 146, 158, 14, 4158, 185, 33, 77, 4158, 13, 474, 3, 403, 146, 1177, 2512, 22, 149, 4158, 960, 77, 4158, 598, 13, 755, 4158, 42, 77, 93, 345, 23, 702, 2020, 63, 52, 269, 162, 34, 115, 25, 245, 53, 2, 63, 25, 382, 53, 198, 586, 9, 135, 96, 867, 682, 4777, 4158, 24, 87, 4392, 1925, 50, 1852, 9, 867, 1925, 130, 4158, 10, 44, 1199, 6, 8, 97, 101, 43, 9, 521, 702, 2020, 15, 25, 360, 3, 146, 1177, 68, 40, 1424, 4, 476, 7, 84, 403, 1593, 20263, 21, 1906, 6, 1645, 4158, 4, 150, 5, 403, 56]",1775.0,12576918,5

Carcinoid tumor of the biliary tract: treating a rare cause of bile duct obstruction.,The American surgeon,Am Surg,2003-02-01,"Biliary carcinoids are rare with fewer than 30 cases reported in the English literature. The objective of this report is to describe an additional patient found to have a biliary carcinoid and to define the presentation, diagnosis, and management of patients with this rare biliary tumor. In our case the patient initially presented with clinical jaundice and elevated transaminases. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiogram established a mass suspicious for cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor). The patient was initially managed with an endostent, which was later removed in favor of a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram tube. At the time of surgery successful removal of a firm nodular mass at the area of the ductal bifurcation was achieved and biliary continuity re-established with a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. Pathology revealed carcinoid tumor of the bile duct with one lymph node positive for tumor. The patient did not receive any adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy. This case serves to highlight that extrahepatic biliary carcinoids constitute a rare but identifiable subset of bile duct tumors. Diagnostic workup should include US, CT, and cholangiography. Surgical exploration is universally indicated in physiologically fit patients with operative management to include resection and re-establishment of biliary continuity.

Analysis of novel tumor markers in pancreatic and biliary carcinomas using tissue microarrays.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2004-03-01,"Using global gene expression analyses, multiple novel tumor markers overexpressed in infiltrating ductal adenocarcinomas of the pancreas have recently been identified. However, the expression of these markers in morphologically similar adenocarcinomas of the biliary tree has not been investigated. The purpose of the present study was 3-fold. First, we used 8 markers that have been shown to be overexpressed in whole tissue sections of pancreatic adenocarcinomas to validate tissue microarrays (TMAs) created from a series of pancreatic adenocarcinomas (n=68). The labeling patterns of 6 epithelial markers (fascin, mucin 4, 14-3-3sigma, prostate stem cell antigen, topoisomerase IIalpha, and cdc2/p34) were concordant with previously published studies on whole tissue sections, yet required far fewer slides and reagents. Mesothelin, an epithelial marker, and heat shock protein 47, a marker of peritumoral desmoplasia, showed lower levels of expression in the TMAs when compared with whole tissue sections. Second, we examined the previously unknown expression of the same 8 novel tumor proteins in cancers of the biliary tree by using TMAs created from a series of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, gallbladder adenocarcinomas, and adenocarcinomas of the distal common bile duct (n=38). Each of the 8 markers was overexpressed in the biliary cancers, ranging from 14% demonstrating at least focal labeling with prostate stem cell antigen to 100% labeling with cdc2/p34. Most of the markers showed lower frequencies of expression in the biliary tract carcinomas in comparison to the pancreatic adenocarcinomas. In addition, expression patterns varied with location in the biliary system (intrahepatic versus gallbladder versus distal common bile duct). These differences were statistically significant (P<0.05) for mesothelin, mucin 4, and heat shock protein 47. Finally, the expression of selected markers in neoplastic progression of gallbladder cancer was examined. Two markers, fascin and mesothelin, showed up-regulation of expression with transition from carcinoma in situ to invasive adenocarcinoma, implicating a role for these markers in neoplastic progression. The results of this study indicate that TMA technology provides valid and cost-effective means to screen large numbers of novel tumor markers, even in tumors such as pancreatic and biliary adenocarcinomas that characteristically have abundant desmoplastic stroma. In addition, novel tumor markers of pancreatic adenocarcinomas show similar, yet not identical, expression patterns in biliary carcinomas. Therefore, these markers are potentially useful in developing diagnostic tests and treatment paradigms for tumors involving the biliary system.",Journal Article,5804.0,116.0,Using global gene expression analyses multiple novel tumor markers overexpressed in infiltrating ductal adenocarcinomas of the have recently been identified However the expression of these markers in morphologically similar adenocarcinomas of the biliary tree has not been investigated The purpose of the present study was 3-fold First we used 8 markers that have been shown to be overexpressed in whole tissue sections of adenocarcinomas to validate tissue microarrays TMAs created from a series of adenocarcinomas n=68 The labeling patterns of 6 epithelial markers fascin mucin 4 14-3-3sigma stem cell antigen topoisomerase IIalpha and cdc2/p34 were concordant with previously published studies on whole tissue sections yet required far fewer slides and reagents Mesothelin an epithelial marker and heat shock protein 47 a marker of peritumoral desmoplasia showed lower levels of expression in the TMAs when compared with whole tissue sections Second we examined the previously unknown expression of the same 8 novel tumor proteins in cancers of the biliary tree by using TMAs created from a series of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas adenocarcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the distal common duct n=38 Each of the 8 markers was overexpressed in the biliary cancers ranging from 14 demonstrating at least focal labeling with stem cell antigen to 100 labeling with cdc2/p34 Most of the markers showed lower frequencies of expression in the biliary tract carcinomas in comparison to the adenocarcinomas In addition expression patterns varied with location in the biliary system intrahepatic versus versus distal common duct These differences were statistically significant P 0.05 for mesothelin mucin 4 and heat shock protein 47 Finally the expression of selected markers in neoplastic progression of cancer was examined Two markers fascin and mesothelin showed up-regulation of expression with transition from carcinoma in situ to invasive adenocarcinoma implicating a role for these markers in neoplastic progression The results of this study indicate that TMA technology provides valid and cost-effective means to screen large numbers of novel tumor markers even in tumors such as and biliary adenocarcinomas that characteristically have abundant desmoplastic stroma In addition novel tumor markers of adenocarcinomas show similar yet not identical expression patterns in biliary carcinomas Therefore these markers are potentially useful in developing diagnostic tests and treatment paradigms for tumors involving the biliary system,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[75, 1648, 145, 55, 318, 232, 229, 30, 525, 1711, 4, 2097, 1258, 1586, 1, 3, 47, 761, 85, 108, 137, 3, 55, 1, 46, 525, 4, 6204, 288, 1586, 1, 3, 2532, 4899, 71, 44, 85, 565, 3, 743, 1, 3, 364, 45, 10, 27, 1116, 157, 21, 95, 66, 525, 17, 47, 85, 443, 6, 40, 1711, 4, 902, 246, 3013, 1, 1586, 6, 2183, 246, 2774, 11278, 2466, 29, 8, 988, 1, 1586, 78, 806, 3, 3383, 764, 1, 49, 701, 525, 19632, 5258, 39, 213, 27, 43538, 452, 31, 448, 3999, 16352, 2, 8747, 18787, 11, 3610, 5, 373, 983, 94, 23, 902, 246, 3013, 1145, 616, 3272, 1497, 3830, 2, 9543, 5402, 35, 701, 952, 2, 3545, 3971, 178, 662, 8, 952, 1, 5432, 19633, 224, 280, 148, 1, 55, 4, 3, 11278, 198, 72, 5, 902, 246, 3013, 419, 21, 409, 3, 373, 860, 55, 1, 3, 827, 66, 229, 30, 652, 4, 163, 1, 3, 2532, 4899, 20, 75, 11278, 2466, 29, 8, 988, 1, 3022, 9386, 1586, 2, 1586, 1, 3, 2107, 186, 2920, 78, 519, 296, 1, 3, 66, 525, 10, 1711, 4, 3, 2532, 163, 2223, 29, 213, 2219, 28, 506, 2137, 3383, 5, 452, 31, 448, 6, 394, 3383, 5, 8747, 18787, 96, 1, 3, 525, 224, 280, 2722, 1, 55, 4, 3, 2532, 1696, 826, 4, 1155, 6, 3, 1586, 4, 352, 55, 764, 2051, 5, 1147, 4, 3, 2532, 398, 3022, 185, 185, 2107, 186, 2920, 46, 362, 11, 712, 93, 19, 13, 474, 9, 5402, 5258, 39, 2, 3545, 3971, 178, 662, 1368, 3, 55, 1, 715, 525, 4, 2000, 91, 1, 12, 10, 409, 100, 525, 19632, 2, 5402, 224, 126, 863, 1, 55, 5, 1970, 29, 134, 4, 957, 6, 416, 449, 7912, 8, 200, 9, 46, 525, 4, 2000, 91, 3, 99, 1, 26, 45, 1008, 17, 5501, 2033, 777, 4406, 2, 835, 323, 2263, 6, 2413, 375, 1870, 1, 229, 30, 525, 871, 4, 57, 225, 22, 2, 2532, 1586, 17, 14079, 47, 4834, 5922, 2477, 4, 352, 229, 30, 525, 1, 1586, 514, 288, 1145, 44, 3038, 55, 764, 4, 2532, 826, 673, 46, 525, 32, 751, 999, 4, 931, 752, 895, 2, 24, 4887, 9, 57, 1267, 3, 2532, 398]",2534.0,15017593,7
Advances in the surgical management of liver malignancies.,"Cancer journal (Sudbury, Mass.)",Cancer J,,"Primary malignancies of the liver include tumors arising from the hepatocytes (hepatocellular carcinoma and the fibrolamellar variant) and the intrahepatic bile ducts (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma). Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary cancer of the liver and is a leading cause of death from cancer worldwide. Although it is uncommon in the United States, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma is rising. Hepatitis, ethanol use, and cirrhosis often dominate the clinical picture and may dictate prognosis. New clinical and pathological staging systems have allowed for the more accurate stratification of patients to more appropriately identify patients for resection, transplantation, and percutaneous ablation therapies. A correlation between liver volume and surgical outcome has recently been demonstrated, with small liver remnant size being associated with increased morbidity. Portal vein embolization has therefore been proposed as one way to induce hypertrophy of the anticipated liver remnant before resection. Initial reports have shown that portal vein embolization decreases the incidence of postoperative complications. More recently, systemic chemotherapy and chemoembolization have been investigated as both primary and neoadjuvant therapy. Chemoimmunotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and interferon may be associated with a superior response rate in the fibrolamellar variant of hepatocellular carcinoma. Two recent randomized studies have also indicated improved survival after hepatic artery embolization in selected patients.",Journal Article,,19.0,Primary malignancies of the include tumors arising from the hepatocytes carcinoma and the fibrolamellar variant and the intrahepatic ducts intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma carcinoma is the most common primary cancer of the and is a leading cause of death from cancer worldwide Although it is uncommon in the United States the incidence of carcinoma is rising Hepatitis ethanol use and cirrhosis often dominate the clinical picture and may dictate prognosis New clinical and pathological staging systems have allowed for the more accurate stratification of patients to more appropriately identify patients for resection transplantation and percutaneous ablation therapies A correlation between volume and surgical outcome has recently been demonstrated with small remnant size being associated with increased morbidity Portal vein embolization has therefore been proposed as one way to induce hypertrophy of the anticipated remnant before resection Initial reports have shown that portal vein embolization decreases the incidence of postoperative complications More recently systemic chemotherapy and chemoembolization have been investigated as both primary and neoadjuvant therapy Chemoimmunotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and interferon may be associated with a superior response rate in the fibrolamellar variant of carcinoma Two recent randomized studies have also indicated improved survival after hepatic artery embolization in selected patients,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[86, 441, 1, 3, 643, 57, 2635, 29, 3, 8291, 134, 2, 3, 9686, 1142, 2, 3, 3022, 7310, 3022, 2126, 134, 16, 3, 96, 186, 86, 12, 1, 3, 2, 16, 8, 1049, 708, 1, 273, 29, 12, 2358, 242, 192, 16, 2052, 4, 3, 1088, 907, 3, 287, 1, 134, 16, 3699, 3002, 9103, 119, 2, 3563, 629, 18953, 3, 38, 8951, 2, 68, 14841, 356, 217, 38, 2, 1301, 632, 1530, 47, 2313, 9, 3, 80, 1481, 1541, 1, 7, 6, 80, 4544, 255, 7, 9, 170, 497, 2, 3720, 1650, 235, 8, 816, 59, 433, 2, 221, 228, 71, 761, 85, 264, 5, 302, 5644, 444, 486, 41, 5, 101, 787, 3307, 2762, 4232, 71, 673, 85, 1587, 22, 104, 2255, 6, 1290, 9544, 1, 3, 4078, 5644, 348, 170, 388, 1198, 47, 443, 17, 3307, 2762, 4232, 2140, 3, 287, 1, 573, 521, 80, 761, 403, 56, 2, 6056, 47, 85, 565, 22, 110, 86, 2, 536, 36, 4438, 5, 33, 1404, 2, 1688, 68, 40, 41, 5, 8, 1123, 51, 116, 4, 3, 9686, 1142, 1, 134, 100, 435, 384, 94, 47, 120, 1103, 231, 25, 50, 939, 2872, 4232, 4, 715, 7]",1446.0,15130267,44

A comparison of routine cytology and fluorescence in situ hybridization for the detection of malignant bile duct strictures.,The American journal of gastroenterology,Am. J. Gastroenterol.,2004-09-01,"The aim of this study was to assess the relative sensitivities and specificities of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and routine cytology for the detection of malignancy in biliary tract strictures. Bile duct brushing and aspirate specimens were collected from 131 patients being evaluated for possible malignant bile duct strictures. Both specimen types were assessed by FISH but only brushing specimens were assessed by cytology. The FISH assay used a mixture of fluorescently-labeled probes to the centromeres of chromosomes 3, 7, and 17 and chromosomal band 9p21 (Vysis UroVysion) to identify cells having chromosomal abnormalities. A case was considered positive for malignancy if five or more cells exhibited polysomy. Sixty-six of the 131 patients had surgical pathologic and/or clinical evidence of malignancy. Thirty-nine patients had cholangiocarcinoma, 19 had pancreatic carcinoma, and 8 had other types of malignancy. The sensitivity of cytology and FISH for the detection of malignancy in bile duct brushing specimens in these patients was 15% and 34% (p < 0.01), respectively. The sensitivity of FISH for the bile aspirate specimens was 23%, and the combined sensitivity of FISH for aspirate and brushing specimens was 35%.

Phase II trials of dolastatin-10 in advanced pancreaticobiliary cancers.,Investigational new drugs,Invest New Drugs,2005-10-01,"Pancreaticobiliary malignancies respond poorly to conventional chemotherapy, and novel agents are needed. Dolatstatin-10 is a potent antimitotic pentapeptide isolated from the marine mollusk Dolabella auricularia that inhibits microtubule assembly. We conducted 2 parallel phase II trials of dolastatin-10 in patients with advanced hepatobiliary cancers and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Eligible patients had histologically-confirmed metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma or metastatic, locally advanced or recurrent cancer of the liver, bile duct or gallbladder, and had received no prior chemotherapy for advanced disease. Dolastatin-10 400 microg/m(2) was administered intravenously by bolus every 21 days. Restaging CT scans were obtained every 2 cycles. Twenty-eight patients (16 hepatobiliary, including 7 hepatomas, 6 cholangiocarcinomas, 2 gallbladder carcinomas, and 12 pancreatic carcinomas) enrolled; 27 were evaluable for response. There were no objective responses. Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in 59% of patients and neutropenic fever in 18%.

Clinical information was obtained from the medical record and all resected specimens were reexamined. From January 1992 to July 2003, 275 patients with proximal biliary strictures were referred. Among these, 22 patients had a final histologic diagnosis of benign stricture, despite a suspected preoperative diagnosis of malignancy. All 22 patients underwent resection of the extrahepatic biliary tree, which in 10 patients was combined with en bloc partial hepatectomy. Histologic reexamination identified five different benign processes: lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis and cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, granulomatous disease, nonspecific fibrosis/inflammation, and stone disease. Major postoperative morbidity occurred in 6 (26%) patients but none died.

"Differential cell cycle-regulatory protein expression in biliary tract adenocarcinoma: correlation with anatomic site, pathologic variables, and clinical outcome.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2006-03-01,"Biliary tract adenocarcinomas (BTAs), although anatomically related, arise through ill-defined and possibly different location-related pathogenetic pathways. This clinicopathologic study characterizes differences in cell cycle-regulatory protein expression across the spectrum of BTA. Tissue microarrays were prepared from paraffin-embedded surgical specimens with triplicate cores of BTA and benign tissue. Immunohistochemical expression of p53, cyclin D1, p21, Bcl2, p27, Mdm2, and Ki-67 was assessed, and the results were correlated with pathologic variables and survival. Hierarchical clustering was used to partition the data based on protein expression, and then the data were analyzed according to anatomic location. Tissue from 128 surgical patients (1992 to 2002) was obtained. Tumor sites of origin were intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IH; n = 23), hilar cholangiocarcinoma (Hilar; n = 54), gallbladder (GB; n = 32), and distal bile duct (Distal; n = 19). p27 expression decreased progressively from proximal to distal in the biliary tree and correlated with location-related differences in outcome; cyclin D1 and Bcl2 overexpression also varied according to anatomic site. Aberrant p53 staining and cyclin D1 overexpression were lower in papillary tumors compared with the more common sclerosing tumors. The expression profiles of GB and Hilar were more similar to each other than either was to IH or Distal (86% clustering in the first partition).

Other causes for cholestatic jaundice were ruled out. He was treated with subtotal lymphoid irradiation and subsequently experienced a steady improvement in his liver function tests to near normal over 21 months. This case illustrates a rare paraneoplastic phenomenon, and a review of the available literature is included. We also discuss the differences between HL-related idiopathic cholestasis and VBDS. The distinction between these 2 diseases has prognostic implications: idiopathic cholestasis is usually reversible in early-stage HL after treatment, whereas patients who develop VBDS commonly die from their disease.

Systemic therapy of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: how hopeful should we be?,The oncologist,Oncologist,,"Worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer-related death. In the U.S., 18,510 new cancers of the liver and intrahepatic bile duct are expected in 2006, with an estimated 16,200 deaths. The incidence rates for HCC in the U.S. continued to rise steadily through 1998 and doubled during the period 1975-1995. Unresectable or metastatic HCC carries a poor prognosis, and systemic therapy with cytotoxic agents provides marginal benefit. A majority of HCC patients (>80%) presents with advanced or unresectable disease. Even for those with resected disease, the recurrence rate can be as high as 50% at 2 years. Because of the poor track record of systemic therapy in HCC, there has been a sense of nihilism for this disease in the oncology community for decades. However, with the arrival of newly developed molecularly targeted agents and the success of some of these agents in other traditionally challenging cancers, like renal cell carcinoma, there has recently been renewed interest in developing systemic therapy for HCC.

All patients with hilar obstruction presumed to represent HCCA were included (1997-2001). The extent of disease was assessed preoperatively with computed tomography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and Duplex ultrasonography, and these findings were correlated to the final histopathology.

A total of 34 cases of adenocarcinoma of the DCBD were treated with PD and adjuvant chemoradiation at Johns Hopkins Hospital between 1994 and 2003. Median radiation dose was 5,040 cGy (range, 4,000-5,400 cGy). Concurrent 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy was given with radiation therapy, followed by maintenance chemotherapy. The median follow-up of patients alive at the time of analysis was 41 months. Death occurred in 21 of 34 patients (62%) during the follow-up period, all from progressive, distant metastatic disease. Median overall survival was 36.9 months, with a 5-year survival of 35%. On multivariate analysis, only nodal status significantly predicted survival (p < 0.02). For patients with negative and positive lymph nodes, 5-year survival was 100% and 24%, respectively. Actuarial 5-year local control was 70%. Compared with historical controls who underwent PD alone, patients who underwent surgery and adjuvant chemoradiation had significantly longer survival (36.9 months vs. 22 months; p < 0.05).

Determinants of survival vary in the literature, due to a lack of sufficient numbers of patients in most series. We studied 564 consecutive patients with bile duct cancer operated upon between 1973 and 2004. Patients were divided into intrahepatic, perihilar, and distal groups. Principle outcome measures were complications, 30-day mortality, and survival. Of the 564 patients, 44 (8%) had intrahepatic, 281 (50%) had perihilar, and 239 (42%) had distal tumors. Approximately half (294, 52%) were treated before 1995, while 270 (48%) were treated thereafter. The perioperative mortality rate was 4%. In log-rank analyses, survival was higher in the later time period (P = 0.002), in patients with intrahepatic disease (P = 0.001), with negative resection margins (P < 0.001), with well/moderately differentiated tumors (P < 0.001), and those with negative lymph nodal status (P < 0.001).

High-resolution computed tomography accurately predicts resectability in hilar cholangiocarcinoma.,American journal of surgery,Am. J. Surg.,2007-06-01,"Despite the use of radiologic, endoscopic, and laparoscopic staging techniques, the rate of nontherapeutic laparotomies in patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma remains high. This study evaluated the accuracy of preoperative high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) to determine resectability in this setting. Preoperative helical HRCT (2 contrast phases, rapid intravenous contrast bolus, 2.5-mm section thickness) for 32 consecutive patients who underwent laparotomy for the diagnosis of hilar cholangiocarcinoma from 2000 to 2005 were reviewed by a hepatobiliary radiologist. The accuracy of HRCT was determined by comparison of the imaging interpretation to intraoperative and pathologic findings. The chi-square test was used to identify imaging findings that best predicted unresectability. Fourteen of the 32 (44%) study patients were unresectable (extension along bile duct, 4; peritoneal metastases, 4; vascular encasement, 3; noncontiguous liver metastases, 2; N2 lymphadenopathy, 1). HRCT correctly predicted resectability in 17 of 18 patients who underwent therapeutic laparotomy (sensitivity = 94%). HRCT correctly predicted the inability to resect in 11 of the remaining 14 cases (specificity = 79%). In the 3 cases in which HRCT predicted resectability and the patient was unresectable, subcentimeter peritoneal disease, a subcentimeter liver metastasis, and distal bile duct involvement were responsible factors. The negative and positive predictive values of HRCT were 92% and 85%, respectively. Individual radiographic findings that best predicted unresectability were peritoneal spread (P = .015) and hepatic artery (P = .006) or portal vein (P = .002) involvement.

Incidence of finding residual disease for incidental gallbladder carcinoma: implications for re-resection.,Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,J. Gastrointest. Surg.,2007-09-11,"Re-resection for gallbladder carcinoma incidentally discovered after cholecystectomy is routinely advocated. However, the incidence of finding additional disease at the time of re-resection remains poorly defined. Between 1984 and 2006, 115 patients underwent re-resection at six major hepatobiliary centers for gallbladder carcinoma incidentally discovered during cholecystectomy. Data on clinicopathologic factors, operative details, TNM tumor stage, and outcome were collected and analyzed. Data on the incidence and location of residual/additional carcinoma discovered at the time of re-resection were also recorded. On pathologic analysis, T stage was T1 7.8%, T2 67.0%, and T3 25.2%. The median time from cholecystectomy to re-resection was 52 days. At the time of re-resection, hepatic surgery most often consisted of formal segmentectomy (64.9%). Patients underwent lymphadenectomy (LND) (50.5%) or LND + common bile duct resection (43.3%). The median number of lymph nodes harvested was 3 and did not differ between LND alone (n = 3) vs LND + common duct resection (n = 3) (P = 0.35). Pathology from the re-resection specimen noted residual/additional disease in 46.4% of patients. Of those patients staged as T1, T2, or T3, 0, 10.4, and 36.4%, respectively, had residual disease within the liver (P = 0.01). T stage was also associated with the risk of metastasis to locoregional lymph nodes (lymph node metastasis: T1 12.5%; T2 31.3%, T3 45.5%; P = 0.04). Cystic duct margin status predicted residual disease in the common bile duct (negative cystic duct, 4.3% vs positive cystic duct, 42.1%) (P = 0.01). Aggressive re-resection for incidental gallbladder carcinoma is warranted as the majority of patients have residual disease. Although common duct resection does not yield a greater lymph node count, it should be performed at the time of re-resection for patients with positive cystic duct margins because over one-third will have residual disease in the common bile duct.",Journal Article,4515.0,153.0,Re-resection for carcinoma incidentally discovered after cholecystectomy is routinely advocated However the incidence of finding additional disease at the time of re-resection remains poorly defined Between 1984 and 2006 115 patients underwent re-resection at six major hepatobiliary centers for carcinoma incidentally discovered during cholecystectomy Data on clinicopathologic factors operative details TNM tumor stage and outcome were collected and analyzed Data on the incidence and location of residual/additional carcinoma discovered at the time of re-resection were also recorded On pathologic analysis T stage was T1 7.8 T2 67.0 and T3 25.2 The median time from cholecystectomy to re-resection was 52 days At the time of re-resection hepatic surgery most often consisted of formal segmentectomy 64.9 Patients underwent lymphadenectomy LND 50.5 or LND common duct resection 43.3 The median number of lymph nodes harvested was 3 and did not differ between LND alone n 3 vs LND common duct resection n 3 P 0.35 Pathology from the re-resection specimen noted residual/additional disease in 46.4 of patients Of those patients staged as T1 T2 or T3 0 10.4 and 36.4 respectively had residual disease within the P 0.01 T stage was also associated with the risk of metastasis to locoregional lymph nodes lymph node metastasis T1 12.5 T2 31.3 T3 45.5 P 0.04 Cystic duct margin status predicted residual disease in the common duct negative cystic duct 4.3 vs positive cystic duct 42.1 P 0.01 Aggressive re-resection for incidental carcinoma is warranted as the majority of patients have residual disease Although common duct resection does not yield a greater lymph node count it should be performed at the time of re-resection for patients with positive cystic duct margins because over one-third will have residual disease in the common duct,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1491, 170, 9, 134, 5925, 2747, 50, 8493, 16, 3066, 8866, 137, 3, 287, 1, 1567, 402, 34, 28, 3, 98, 1, 1491, 170, 469, 1240, 395, 59, 6036, 2, 1324, 3670, 7, 208, 1491, 170, 28, 437, 458, 4718, 1168, 9, 134, 5925, 2747, 190, 8493, 74, 23, 1399, 130, 1208, 3791, 2918, 30, 82, 2, 228, 11, 786, 2, 311, 74, 23, 3, 287, 2, 1147, 1, 753, 402, 134, 2747, 28, 3, 98, 1, 1491, 170, 11, 120, 1872, 23, 510, 65, 102, 82, 10, 1534, 67, 66, 1786, 598, 13, 2, 2065, 243, 18, 3, 52, 98, 29, 8493, 6, 1491, 170, 10, 653, 162, 28, 3, 98, 1, 1491, 170, 939, 152, 96, 629, 1695, 1, 5057, 16767, 660, 83, 7, 208, 2048, 3400, 212, 33, 15, 3400, 186, 2920, 170, 601, 27, 3, 52, 207, 1, 263, 502, 6503, 10, 27, 2, 205, 44, 1505, 59, 3400, 279, 78, 27, 105, 3400, 186, 2920, 170, 78, 27, 19, 13, 465, 1117, 29, 3, 1491, 170, 2360, 1051, 753, 402, 34, 4, 641, 39, 1, 7, 1, 135, 7, 2930, 22, 1534, 1786, 15, 2065, 13, 79, 39, 2, 511, 39, 106, 42, 753, 34, 262, 3, 19, 13, 355, 102, 82, 10, 120, 41, 5, 3, 43, 1, 278, 6, 1325, 263, 502, 263, 289, 278, 1534, 133, 33, 1786, 456, 27, 2065, 512, 33, 19, 13, 755, 2965, 2920, 959, 156, 783, 753, 34, 4, 3, 186, 2920, 199, 2965, 2920, 39, 27, 105, 109, 2965, 2920, 595, 14, 19, 13, 355, 571, 1491, 170, 9, 4490, 134, 16, 1197, 22, 3, 686, 1, 7, 47, 753, 34, 242, 186, 2920, 170, 1097, 44, 2309, 8, 378, 263, 289, 1276, 192, 257, 40, 173, 28, 3, 98, 1, 1491, 170, 9, 7, 5, 109, 2965, 2920, 1012, 408, 252, 104, 1282, 303, 47, 753, 34, 4, 3, 186, 2920]",1840.0,17846848,33
Is resection of periampullary or pancreatic adenocarcinoma with synchronous hepatic metastasis justified?,Cancer,Cancer,2007-12-01,"To date, no consensus has been reached regarding which primary tumor subtypes are managed appropriately with hepatic metastectomy. Specifically, the role of hepatic resection for metastatic periampullary or pancreatic adenocarcinoma remains controversial. Between 1995 and 2005, 1563 patients underwent surgical resection for periampullary carcinoma (n=608 patients) or pancreatic adenocarcinoma (head, n=905 patients; tail, n=50 patients). Data on demographics, operative details, primary tumor status, and-when indicated-extent of hepatic metastasis were collected. Of the 1563 patients who underwent resection of periampullary or pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 22 patients (1.4%) underwent simultaneous hepatic resection for synchronous liver metastasis. The primary tumor site was ampullary (n=1 patient ), duodenal (n=2 patients), distal bile duct (n=2 patients), or pancreas (head, n=10 patients; tail, n=7 patients). The majority of patients (86.4%) had a solitary hepatic metastasis, and the median size of the largest lesion was 0.6 cm. Hepatic metastectomy included wedge resection (n=20 patients), segmentectomy (n=1 patient), and hemihepatectomy (n=1 patient). After matching patients on primary tumor histology and location, the median survival of patients who underwent hepatic resection of synchronous metastasis was 5.9 months compared with 5.6 months for patients who underwent palliative bypass alone (P=.46) and 14.2 months for patients with no metastatic disease who underwent primary tumor resection only (P<.001). Pancreatic (median, 5.9 months) versus nonpancreatic (median, 9.9 months) primary tumor histology was not associated with a difference in survival in patients who underwent resection of synchronous liver metastasis (P=.43).

We describe the development of an integrated pancreatic tissue bank (PTB) and clinical database for patients with pancreatic cancer and other pancreatic disorders. A clinical database and PTB were created in 1990 and 2000, respectively, to collect clinical information and biospecimens from patients with suspected or confirmed pancreatic cancer, other pancreatic diseases, and tumors of the duodenum, ampulla of Vater, and distal bile duct. Standard procedures for biospecimen collection and data entry were developed. From 2000 through 2006, the PTB collected 8,061 pancreatic tissue specimens from 620 patients. The most common histologies of pancreatic tumors were pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (55.3%) and neuroendocrine carcinoma (16.3%). The biospecimen collection also includes 431 plasma samples, 40 fine-needle aspiration samples, and a tissue microarray containing 85 pancreatic adenocarcinomas and matched normal tissue specimens. The clinical database contains information for 7,647 patients with pancreatic cancer, other pancreatic disorders, and duodenal, ampullary, or bile duct neoplasms. The data are arranged into nine modules: patient, presentation, risk factors, diagnostic imaging, treatment plan, surgery, pathology, postoperative complications, and follow-up.

Systemic therapy for biliary tract cancers.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2008-04-01,"Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) are invasive carcinomas that arise from the epithelial lining of the gallbladder and bile ducts. These include intrahepatic, perihilar, and distal biliary tree cancers as well as carcinoma arising from the gallbladder. Complete surgical resection offers the only chance for cure; however, only 10% of patients present with early-stage disease and are considered surgical candidates. Among those patients who do undergo ""curative"" resection, recurrence rates are high; thus, for the majority of BTC patients, systemic chemotherapy is the mainstay of their treatment plan. Patients with unresectable or metastatic BTC have a poor prognosis, with a median overall survival time of <1 year. Despite a paucity of randomized phase III data, a consensus on first-line systemic therapy is emerging.

Prospective evaluation of advanced molecular markers and imaging techniques in patients with indeterminate bile duct strictures.,The American journal of gastroenterology,Am. J. Gastroenterol.,2008-05-01,"Standard techniques for evaluating bile duct strictures have poor sensitivity for detection of malignancy. Newer imaging modalities, such as intraductal ultrasound (IDUS), and advanced cytologic techniques, such as digital image analysis (DIA) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), identify chromosomal abnormalities, and may improve sensitivity while maintaining high specificity. Our aim was to prospectively evaluate the accuracy of these techniques in patients with indeterminate biliary strictures. Cholangiography, routine cytology (RC), intraductal biopsy, DIA, FISH, and IDUS were performed in 86 patients with indeterminate biliary strictures. Patients were stratified based on the presence or absence of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). RC provided low sensitivity (7-33%) but high specificity (95-100%) for PSC and non-PSC patients. The composite DIA/FISH results (when considering trisomy-7 [Tri-7] as a marker of benign disease) yielded a 100% specificity and increased sensitivity one- to fivefold in PSC patients versus RC, and two- to fivefold in patients without PSC, depending on how suspicious cytology results were interpreted. For the most difficult-to-manage patients with negative cytology and histology who were later proven to have malignancy (N = 21), DIA, FISH, composite DIA/FISH, and IDUS were able to predict malignant diagnoses in 14%, 62%, 67%, and 86%, respectively. DIA, FISH, and IDUS enhance the accuracy of standard techniques in evaluation of indeterminate bile duct strictures, allowing diagnosis of malignancy in a substantial number of patients with false-negative cytology and histology.

Computed tomography imaging revealed fullness of the pancreatic head and multiple enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Cholangiogram revealed a distal common bile duct stricture. Due to concerns of malignancy, the patient underwent operative exploration. Several enlarged lymph nodes in the aortocaval region and a firm hard mass in the pancreatic head were found. Frozen section from one of the lymph nodes was suspicious for low-grade lymphoma. A pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. Histologic analysis of the pancreatic head revealed a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with stromal fibrosis consistent with autoimmune pancreatitis. The retroperitoneal lymph nodes were involved by small lymphocytic lymphoma. Autoimmune pancreatitis is the most common benign diagnosis after pancreatic resection for presumed malignancy. It has a well-documented association with autoimmune conditions, such as Sjögren's syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and sclerosing cholangitis. Additionally, chronic lymphocytic leukemia-small lymphocytic lymphoma is often associated with autoimmune phenomena, most notably autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

The association between disease-specific survival (DSS) and pathologic margin status determined during and after surgical resection for HCCA was assessed retrospectively for 101 patients between 1992 and 2005. Final histopathology identified three subgroups on the basis of resection margin status: wide margin (bile duct and specimen margins negative for adenocarcinoma), narrow margin (bile duct margin negative but specimen margins positive), and positive margin (bile duct and specimen margins positive). On the basis of frozen section analysis alone, 90 patients were thought to have a disease-negative bile duct margin intraoperatively. Final histopathology showed that eight patients (9%) had invasive adenocarcinoma in the cuff of bile duct submitted for frozen section analysis. Of the 82 patients with negative final bile duct margins, 54 patients were categorized as having wide margins, and 28 patients had narrow margins. The median DSS for patients with wide margins was 56 months compared with 38 months for patients with narrow margins and 32 months for margin-positive patients (P = .01).

We sought to evaluate recurrence patterns and prognostic factors for disease-specific and disease-free survival in patients with surgically resected hilar cholangiocarcinoma in a single institution over the last 21 years. From 1985 to 2006, all patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma referred to a tertiary surgical clinic were evaluated. Demographic data, tumor characteristics, and outcome were analyzed retrospectively. Outcome was compared in patients treated in a recent era (1995-2006) compared with an earlier era (1985-1994). Of 91 patients evaluated, 22 patients (24%) had unresectable disease at presentation. Of the 69 patients submitted to laparotomy, resection was possible in 55% and the curative (R0) resection rate was 63%. In patients submitted to exploration, the operative (60 day) morbidity and mortality rates were 26% and 3%. Median disease-specific (DSS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 29 and 20 months, respectively (median FU, 29 months.). In patients undergoing R0 resection, the median survival was prolonged (65 months). In the more recent era, resectability rates improved (69% vs. 17%; P = 0.0002), and this was associated with an improvement in median survival (30 vs. 4 months; P < 0.001). Factors predictive of improved disease-specific and disease-free survival included negative histologic margins, concomitant hepatic lobectomy, lack of nodal disease, well-differentiated histology, and an earlier tumor stage (P < 0.05). Concomitant liver resection was associated with a higher R0 resection rate (P = 0.006) and improved DSS and DFS (P = 0.005). In addition, concomitant liver resection was associated with a decreased incidence of initial recurrence in liver (P = 0.031). In patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma, concomitant hepatic resection is associated with improved DFS, DSS, and decreased hepatic recurrence. Therefore, hepatectomy combined with bile duct resection should be considered standard treatment.",Journal Article,4190.0,128.0,Hilar cholangiocarcinoma is an uncommon tumor with a poor prognosis We sought to evaluate recurrence patterns and prognostic factors for disease-specific and disease-free survival in patients with surgically resected hilar cholangiocarcinoma in a single institution over the last 21 years From 1985 to 2006 all patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma referred to a tertiary surgical clinic were evaluated Demographic data tumor characteristics and outcome were analyzed retrospectively Outcome was compared in patients treated in a recent era 1995-2006 compared with an earlier era 1985-1994 Of 91 patients evaluated 22 patients 24 had unresectable disease at presentation Of the 69 patients submitted to laparotomy resection was possible in 55 and the curative R0 resection rate was 63 In patients submitted to exploration the operative 60 day morbidity and mortality rates were 26 and 3 Median disease-specific DSS and disease-free survival DFS were 29 and 20 months respectively median FU 29 months In patients undergoing R0 resection the median survival was prolonged 65 months In the more recent era resectability rates improved 69 vs. 17 P 0.0002 and this was associated with an improvement in median survival 30 vs. 4 months P 0.001 Factors predictive of improved disease-specific and disease-free survival included negative histologic margins concomitant hepatic lobectomy lack of nodal disease well-differentiated histology and an earlier tumor stage P 0.05 Concomitant resection was associated with a higher R0 resection rate P 0.006 and improved DSS and DFS P 0.005 In addition concomitant resection was associated with a decreased incidence of initial recurrence in P 0.031 In patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma concomitant hepatic resection is associated with improved DFS DSS and decreased hepatic recurrence Therefore hepatectomy combined with duct resection should be considered standard treatment,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4793, 2126, 16, 35, 2052, 30, 5, 8, 334, 356, 21, 990, 6, 376, 146, 764, 2, 177, 130, 9, 34, 112, 2, 34, 115, 25, 4, 7, 5, 2350, 1133, 4793, 2126, 4, 8, 226, 731, 252, 3, 1060, 239, 60, 29, 4675, 6, 1324, 62, 7, 5, 4793, 2126, 1995, 6, 8, 2557, 221, 1188, 11, 194, 1540, 74, 30, 374, 2, 228, 11, 311, 894, 228, 10, 72, 4, 7, 73, 4, 8, 435, 1713, 2323, 1324, 72, 5, 35, 1677, 1713, 4675, 3023, 1, 970, 7, 194, 350, 7, 259, 42, 1468, 34, 28, 1031, 1, 3, 790, 7, 5118, 6, 3274, 170, 10, 899, 4, 614, 2, 3, 1075, 2328, 170, 116, 10, 676, 4, 7, 5118, 6, 3370, 3, 1208, 335, 218, 787, 2, 282, 151, 11, 432, 2, 27, 52, 34, 112, 1788, 2, 34, 115, 25, 1010, 11, 462, 2, 179, 53, 106, 52, 1296, 462, 53, 4, 7, 479, 2328, 170, 3, 52, 25, 10, 1069, 556, 53, 4, 3, 80, 435, 1713, 5150, 151, 231, 790, 105, 269, 19, 13, 3531, 2, 26, 10, 41, 5, 35, 767, 4, 52, 25, 201, 105, 39, 53, 19, 13, 144, 130, 464, 1, 231, 34, 112, 2, 34, 115, 25, 159, 199, 884, 1012, 1781, 939, 3258, 926, 1, 779, 34, 149, 1442, 784, 2, 35, 1677, 30, 82, 19, 13, 474, 1781, 170, 10, 41, 5, 8, 142, 2328, 170, 116, 19, 13, 1861, 2, 231, 1788, 2, 1010, 19, 13, 1614, 4, 352, 1781, 170, 10, 41, 5, 8, 340, 287, 1, 388, 146, 4, 19, 13, 5304, 4, 7, 5, 4793, 2126, 1781, 939, 170, 16, 41, 5, 231, 1010, 1788, 2, 340, 939, 146, 673, 2711, 397, 5, 2920, 170, 257, 40, 515, 260, 24]",1916.0,18650638,84
Extrahepatic bile duct adenocarcinoma: patients at high-risk for local recurrence treated with surgery and adjuvant chemoradiation have an equivalent overall survival to patients with standard-risk treated with surgery alone.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2008-08-27,"Patients with resected extrahepatic bile duct adenocarcinoma who have microscopically positive resection margins and/or pathologic locoregional nodal involvement (R1pN1) have a high-risk of locoregional recurrence, and therefore, we advocate the use of adjuvant chemoradiation. To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of this treatment, we compared survival and side effects outcomes between such patients and patients with negative resection margins and pathologically negative nodes (R0pN0) who did not receive adjuvant treatment. Between 1984 and 2005, 65 patients were treated with curative-intended resection for extrahepatic bile duct adenocarcinoma. Patients with tumors arising in the gallbladder and periampullary region were excluded. Pathology and diagnostic images were centrally reviewed. Overall survival and locoregional recurrence outcomes for patients with standard-risk R0pN0 (surgery alone, or S group, n = 23) were compared with those of patients with high locoregional recurrence risk, R1 and/or pN1 (R1pN1) status who received adjuvant chemoradiation (S-CRT group, n = 42). The median follow-up for the entire group was 31 months. Patients in the S-CRT and S groups had a similar 5-year overall survival (36% vs. 42%, P = .6) and locoregional recurrence (5-year rate: 38% vs. 37%, P = .13). In the S-CRT group, three patients (7%) experienced an acute (grade 3 or more) side effect. Our finding of a lack of a survival difference between the S and S-CRT groups suggests that for patients with extrahepatic bile duct adenocarcinoma at high risk for locoregional recurrence (i.e., R1 resection or pN1 disease), adjuvant chemoradiation provides an equivalent overall survival despite of these worse prognostic features.",Journal Article,4164.0,58.0,Patients with resected extrahepatic duct adenocarcinoma who have microscopically positive resection margins and/or pathologic locoregional nodal involvement R1pN1 have a high-risk of locoregional recurrence and therefore we advocate the use of adjuvant chemoradiation To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of this treatment we compared survival and side effects outcomes between such patients and patients with negative resection margins and pathologically negative nodes R0pN0 who did not receive adjuvant treatment Between 1984 and 2005 65 patients were treated with curative-intended resection for extrahepatic duct adenocarcinoma Patients with tumors arising in the and periampullary region were excluded Pathology and diagnostic images were centrally reviewed Overall survival and locoregional recurrence outcomes for patients with standard-risk R0pN0 surgery alone or S group n 23 were compared with those of patients with high locoregional recurrence risk R1 and/or pN1 R1pN1 status who received adjuvant chemoradiation S-CRT group n 42 The median follow-up for the entire group was 31 months Patients in the S-CRT and S groups had a similar 5-year overall survival 36 vs. 42 P .6 and locoregional recurrence 5-year rate 38 vs. 37 P .13 In the S-CRT group three patients 7 experienced an acute grade 3 or more side effect Our finding of a lack of a survival difference between the S and S-CRT groups suggests that for patients with extrahepatic duct adenocarcinoma at high risk for locoregional recurrence i.e. R1 resection or pN1 disease adjuvant chemoradiation provides an equivalent overall survival despite of these worse prognostic features,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[7, 5, 1133, 3710, 2920, 449, 54, 47, 7187, 109, 170, 1012, 2, 15, 510, 1325, 779, 799, 45243, 47, 8, 64, 43, 1, 1325, 146, 2, 673, 21, 8912, 3, 119, 1, 249, 975, 6, 376, 3, 367, 2, 1236, 1, 26, 24, 21, 72, 25, 2, 1152, 176, 123, 59, 225, 7, 2, 7, 5, 199, 170, 1012, 2, 2998, 199, 502, 45244, 54, 205, 44, 560, 249, 24, 59, 6036, 2, 1242, 556, 7, 11, 73, 5, 1075, 4081, 170, 9, 3710, 2920, 449, 7, 5, 57, 2635, 4, 3, 2, 9180, 1053, 11, 1800, 1117, 2, 752, 1572, 11, 4604, 446, 63, 25, 2, 1325, 146, 123, 9, 7, 5, 260, 43, 45244, 152, 279, 15, 695, 87, 78, 382, 11, 72, 5, 135, 1, 7, 5, 64, 1325, 146, 43, 3239, 2, 15, 7945, 45243, 156, 54, 103, 249, 975, 695, 1089, 87, 78, 595, 3, 52, 166, 126, 9, 3, 1797, 87, 10, 456, 53, 7, 4, 3, 695, 1089, 2, 695, 271, 42, 8, 288, 33, 111, 63, 25, 511, 105, 595, 19, 49, 2, 1325, 146, 33, 111, 116, 519, 105, 567, 19, 233, 4, 3, 695, 1089, 87, 169, 7, 67, 592, 35, 286, 88, 27, 15, 80, 1152, 254, 114, 1567, 1, 8, 926, 1, 8, 25, 523, 59, 3, 695, 2, 695, 1089, 271, 844, 17, 9, 7, 5, 3710, 2920, 449, 28, 64, 43, 9, 1325, 146, 70, 563, 3239, 170, 15, 7945, 34, 249, 975, 777, 35, 2017, 63, 25, 550, 1, 46, 639, 177, 404]",1655.0,18754070,8
Analysis of the extent of resection for adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2008-11-05,"Gallbladder cancer has historically been considered an incurable malignancy; although, extended resection has been associated with cure in selected patients. However, the optimal extent of resection is unknown. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of the extent of resection for gallbladder adenocarcinoma on disease-specific survival (DSS) and perioperative morbidity. Analysis of a prospective hepatobiliary surgery database identified patients undergoing surgical resection for gallbladder adenocarcinoma from 1990 to 2002. Clinicopathologic factors including extent of resection were analyzed for their association with DSS and perioperative morbidity. Long-term outcome was evaluable in 104 patients. With median follow-up of 58 months for survivors, the actuarial 5-year DSS was 42%. Thirty-six patients (35%) underwent major hepatectomy, but in 15 this was not mandatory to clear all disease. Sixty-eight patients (65%) underwent common bile duct (CBD) excision, but 32 were performed empirically. Twenty-one patients (20%) underwent en bloc resection of adjacent organs other than the liver. The performance of a major hepatectomy or a CBD excision was not associated with other clinicopathologic variables or long-term survival. Resection of adjacent organs were associated with advanced T stage but not with survival. T stage, N stage, histologic differentiation, and CBD involvement were independently associated with survival. Major hepatectomy and CBD excision were significantly associated with perioperative morbidity. We conclude that tumor biology and stage, rather than extent of resection, predict outcome after resection for gallbladder cancer.

"The role of postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) in the treatment of extrahepatic bile duct cancer: a surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) population-based investigation.",Journal of gastrointestinal cancer,J Gastrointest Cancer,2009-01-21,"Extrahepatic bile duct cancers (EBDC) are aggressive cancers for which the importance of the use of postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) in potentially curative cases remains the subject of clinical investigation. The 1973-2004 National Cancer Institute Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was analyzed for patients with EBDC who had undergone cancer-directed surgery. Patients who died <3 months after surgery were excluded from analysis. Patients with distant metastases, with unknown stage or interventions, or benign histologies were excluded. Nine hundred fifty-six patients were selected. Tumor-related factors, such as regional (vs. local) disease and an increasing number of lymph nodes predicted for the delivery of PORT. In unadjusted univariate analysis, patients treated from 1973 to 2004 who fit the selection criteria had a lower 3-year survival rate if they received PORT vs. no PORT (3 year survival 31.3% vs. 39.6%, p = 0.04), but this improvement did not hold in multivariate survival analysis or in univariate analysis of patient subsets.

In the era of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, incidental gallbladder cancer has dramatically increased and now constitutes the major way patients present with gallbladder cancer. While patients with incidental gallbladder cancer have a better survival than patients with nonincidental gallbladder cancer, incidental gallbladder cancer can be associated with a varied prognosis. Imaging with computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and [18]F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), as well as diagnostic laparoscopy, all have varying roles in the workup of patients with incidental gallbladder cancer. For patients with T1b, T2, and T3 incidental gallbladder cancer re-resection is generally recommended. At re-exploration, many patients with incidental gallbladder cancer will have residual disease. Definitive oncologic management requires re-resection of the liver, portal lymphadenectomy, and attention to the common bile duct. The extent of the hepatic resection should be dictated by the ability to achieve a microscopically negative (R0) margin. Routine resection of the common bile duct is unnecessary but should be undertaken in the setting of a positive cystic duct margin. If an incidental gallbladder cancer is discovered at the time of surgery, whether the surgeon should directly proceed with a more definitive oncologic operation should depend on the surgeon's skill-set and experience.

Surg.,2009-06-10,"Preemptive surgery is the prophylactic removal of an organ at high risk for malignant transformation or the resection of a precancerous or ""early"" malignant neoplasm in an individual with a hereditary predisposition to cancer. Recent advances in molecular diagnostic techniques have improved our understanding of the biologic behavior of these conditions. Predictive testing is an emerging field that attempts to assess the potential risk of cancer development in predisposed individuals. Despite substantial improvement in these forms of testing, all results are imperfect. This information often becomes an important tool that is used by healthcare providers to evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of various risk modifying strategies (i.e., intensive surveillance or preemptive surgery). A systematic literature review was performed using Medline and the bibliographies of all referenced publications to identify articles relating to preemptive surgery for premalignant foregut lesions. In this review, we outline the controversies surrounding predictive risk assessment, surveillance strategies, and preemptive surgery in the management of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) in Barrett's esophagus (BE), hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC), bile duct cysts, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and pancreatic cystic neoplasms. Resection of BE is supported by the progressive nature of the disease, the risk of occult carcinoma, and the lethality of esophageal cancer. Prophylactic total gastrectomy for HDGC appears reasonable in the absence of accurate screening tests but must be balanced by the impact of surgical complications and altered quality of life. Surgical resection of biliary cysts theoretically eliminates the exposed epithelium to decrease the lifetime risk of cholangiocarcinoma. Liver transplantation for PSC remains controversial given the scarcity of donor organs and inability to accurately identify high-risk individuals. Given the uncertain natural history of pancreatic cystic neoplasms, the merits of selective versus obligatory resection will continue to be debated. Preemptive operations require optimal judgment and surgical precision to maximize function and enhance survival.

Depth of tumor invasion better predicts prognosis than the current American Joint Committee on Cancer T classification for distal bile duct carcinoma.,Surgery,Surgery,2009-08-01,"The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) T classification system for cholangiocarcinoma does not take into account the unique pathologic features of the bile duct. As such, the current AJCC T classification for distal cholangiocarcinoma may be inaccurate. A total of 147 patients with distal cholangiocarcinoma were identified from a single institution database. The prognostic importance of depth of tumor invasion relative to the AJCC T classification system was assessed. The AJCC T classification was T1 (n = 11, 7.5%), T2 (n = 6, 4.1%), T3 (n = 73, 49.7%), or T4 (n = 57, 38.8%). When cases were analyzed according to depth of tumor invasion, most lesions were > or =5 mm (<5 mm, 9.5%; range, 5-12, 51.0%; >12 mm, 39.5%). The AJCC T classification was not associated with survival outcome (median survival, T1, 40.1 months; T2, 14.8 months; T3, 16.5 months; T4, 20.2 months; P = .17). In contrast, depth of tumor invasion was associated with a worse outcome as tumor depth increased (median survival, <5 mm, not reached; range, 5-12, 28.9 months; >12 mm, 12.9 months; P = .001).

Elevated cancer mortality in the relatives of patients with pancreatic cancer.,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev.,2009-10-20,"Most inherited cancer syndromes are characterized by the familial clustering of cancers at several organ sites. To determine if cancers, other than pancreatic cancer, cluster in pancreatic cancer kindreds, we examined mortality patterns among the relatives of National Familial Pancreatic Tumor Registry probands. Over 200,000 person-years of follow-up from 8,564 first-degree relatives of probands and 1,007 spouse controls were included in these analyses. We compared mortality rates of National Familial Pancreatic Tumor Registry participants to US population rates using weighed standardized mortality ratios (wSMR). Analyses were stratified by family history of pancreatic cancer (sporadic versus familial), family history of young onset pancreatic cancer (<50 years), and family history score. Cancer mortality was increased in both the relatives of sporadic probands [wSMR 1.55, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.39-1.73] and familial probands (wSMR 1.41, 95% CI 1.26-1.58). Relatives of familial probands had a significantly increased risk of dying from breast (wSMR 1.66, 95% CI 1.15-2.34), ovarian (wSMR 2.05, 95% CI 1.10-3.49), and bile duct cancers (wSMR 2.89, 95% CI 1.04-6.39). Relatives of sporadic probands were at increased risk of dying from bile duct cancer (wSMR 3.01, 95% CI 1.09-6.67). Relatives of young onset probands were at higher risk of dying from cancers of the breast (wSMR 1.98, 95% CI 1.01-3.52), colon (wSMR 2.31, 95% CI 1.30-3.81) and prostate (wSMR 2.31, 95% CI 1.14-4.20).

Biopsy of the contralateral liver demonstrated findings consistent with Alagille syndrome, but no underlying cirrhosis. CT volumetrics demonstrated a future liver remnant of 40%. Extensive hematologic and cardiac work-up was performed pre-operatively, given the syndrome's associated bleeding dyscrasias and cardiac abnormalities. The patient underwent a margin-negative right hepatectomy using the ""hanging"" technique through a thoracoabdominal approach. The patient developed a transient hyperbilirubinemia but no hepatic insufficiency and did well post-operatively.

Adequate lymph node assessment for extrahepatic bile duct adenocarcinoma.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2010-04-01,"To examine the importance of adequate lymph node sampling in staging of extrahepatic bile duct cancer (EHBDCA). The American Joint Committee on Cancer staging manual (sixth edition) states that histologic examination of at least 3 lymph nodes is required for adequate N stage determination for EHBDCA. This recommendation has not been validated; however, there has been no comparative assessment of the proximal versus distal bile duct cancer. A total of 257 patients (144 hilar cholangiocarcinoma [HCCA] and 113 distal bile duct adenocarcinoma [DBDCA]) who underwent curative intent resection (1987-2007) were analyzed; patients with gallbladder cancer were excluded. Final disease staging, including lymph node status and total number of nodes examined (total lymph node count), was obtained from the final pathology report. Differences in disease-specific survival, according to nodal status, were compared using the log-rank test. R1 resections (n = 51) were excluded from this analysis. Metastasis to regional lymph nodes was noted in 89 patients (34.6%) and was an independent prognostic factor of poor survival (median disease-specific survival N0 vs. N1: 53.5 vs. 19.3 months, P < 0.0001, hazard ratio = 2.1 [95% CI: 1.4-3.2]). The median total lymph node count was 6 (range: 0-42), and was significantly lower for HCCA compared with DBDCA (median = 3 [range: 0-16] vs. 12 [range: 1-42], P < 0.001, respectively). For the entire cohort, patients who underwent R0 resection and were classified as N0, based on total lymph node count <11, had a disease-specific survival that was significantly worse than that of patients classified as N0 based on total lymph node count >or=11 (52.6 +/- 9.8 months vs. not reached, P = 0.008).

Fibrolamellar carcinoma of the liver exhibits immunohistochemical evidence of both hepatocyte and bile duct differentiation.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2010-05-21,"Fibrolamellar carcinoma is a rare malignant primary liver neoplasm with characteristic histological features that typically arises in young patients without viral hepatitis or cirrhosis. Previous studies on this entity have been limited by small numbers of patients. In contrast to classical hepatocellular carcinoma, individual cases of fibrolamellar carcinoma have been reported to express cytokeratin 7. In addition, ultrastructural and serological studies have suggested that fibrolamellar carcinoma may show neuroendocrine differentiation. The cellular differentiation of fibrolamellar carcinoma has not been studied and little is reported about its immunohistochemical profile. We studied 26 cases of fibrolamellar carcinoma and 62 cases of classical hepatocellular carcinoma by immunohistochemistry for HepPar1, glypican-3, pCEA, CD10, alpha-fetoprotein, cytokeratin 20, neuroendocrine markers, and surrogate markers for biliary differentiation (cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 19, epithelial membrane antigen, EpCAM, mCEA, B72.3, and CA19.9). In situ hybridization for albumin mRNA was also performed. Tumor cells of fibrolamellar carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma showed positive signals for albumin mRNA by in situ hybridization in all cases. Both tumor types stained uniformly positively with HepPar1 and most showed a canalicular staining pattern for pCEA, confirming their hepatocellular differentiation. In addition, 39% of hepatocellular carcinoma cases and 59% of fibrolamellar carcinoma cases were positive for glypican-3. All 22 fibrolamellar carcinoma cases tested showed positive staining for cytokeratin 7 and epithelial membrane antigen, whereas less than one-third of hepatocellular carcinoma cases were positive for these markers (P<0.0001). Further, 36% of fibrolamellar carcinoma cases showed staining for B72.3, cytokeratin 19, EpCAM, or mCEA. Minimal evidence of neuroendocrine differentiation in either tumor was found with any of the usual immunohistochemical markers used for this purpose. Therefore, cytokeratin 7 and epithelial membrane antigen may be useful to differentiate between fibrolamellar carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. On the basis of immunohistochemistry, fibrolamellar carcinoma seems to show both hepatocellular and bile duct differentiation.",Journal Article,3532.0,62.0,Fibrolamellar carcinoma is a rare malignant primary neoplasm with characteristic histological features that typically arises in young patients without viral hepatitis or cirrhosis Previous studies on this entity have been limited by small numbers of patients In contrast to classical carcinoma individual cases of fibrolamellar carcinoma have been reported to express cytokeratin 7 In addition ultrastructural and serological studies have suggested that fibrolamellar carcinoma may show neuroendocrine differentiation The cellular differentiation of fibrolamellar carcinoma has not been studied and little is reported about its immunohistochemical profile We studied 26 cases of fibrolamellar carcinoma and 62 cases of classical carcinoma by immunohistochemistry for HepPar1 glypican-3 pCEA CD10 alpha-fetoprotein cytokeratin 20 neuroendocrine markers and surrogate markers for biliary differentiation cytokeratin 7 cytokeratin 19 epithelial membrane antigen EpCAM mCEA B72.3 and CA19.9 In situ hybridization for albumin mRNA was also performed Tumor cells of fibrolamellar carcinoma and carcinoma showed positive signals for albumin mRNA by in situ hybridization in all cases Both tumor types stained uniformly positively with HepPar1 and most showed a canalicular staining pattern for pCEA confirming their differentiation In addition 39 of carcinoma cases and 59 of fibrolamellar carcinoma cases were positive for glypican-3 All 22 fibrolamellar carcinoma cases tested showed positive staining for cytokeratin 7 and epithelial membrane antigen whereas less than one-third of carcinoma cases were positive for these markers P 0.0001 Further 36 of fibrolamellar carcinoma cases showed staining for B72.3 cytokeratin 19 EpCAM or mCEA Minimal evidence of neuroendocrine differentiation in either tumor was found with any of the usual immunohistochemical markers used for this purpose Therefore cytokeratin 7 and epithelial membrane antigen may be useful to differentiate between fibrolamellar carcinoma and carcinoma On the basis of immunohistochemistry fibrolamellar carcinoma seems to show both and duct differentiation,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[9686, 134, 16, 8, 622, 393, 86, 2131, 5, 2037, 1831, 404, 17, 1969, 6053, 4, 1169, 7, 187, 1667, 3002, 15, 3563, 698, 94, 23, 26, 2983, 47, 85, 383, 20, 302, 1870, 1, 7, 4, 748, 6, 3781, 134, 797, 140, 1, 9686, 134, 47, 85, 210, 6, 1669, 4292, 67, 4, 352, 13755, 2, 14132, 94, 47, 1148, 17, 9686, 134, 68, 514, 1542, 910, 3, 763, 910, 1, 9686, 134, 71, 44, 85, 656, 2, 1215, 16, 210, 545, 211, 1382, 800, 21, 656, 432, 140, 1, 9686, 134, 2, 744, 140, 1, 3781, 134, 20, 888, 9, 34900, 17206, 27, 22615, 6289, 950, 6607, 4292, 179, 1542, 525, 2, 2592, 525, 9, 2532, 910, 4292, 67, 4292, 326, 701, 1905, 448, 6820, 46052, 31634, 27, 2, 6058, 83, 4, 957, 1554, 9, 2799, 956, 10, 120, 173, 30, 37, 1, 9686, 134, 2, 134, 224, 109, 2312, 9, 2799, 956, 20, 4, 957, 1554, 4, 62, 140, 110, 30, 630, 3386, 4254, 2375, 5, 34900, 2, 96, 224, 8, 18186, 1029, 1177, 9, 22615, 5030, 136, 910, 4, 352, 587, 1, 134, 140, 2, 728, 1, 9686, 134, 140, 11, 109, 9, 17206, 27, 62, 350, 9686, 134, 140, 650, 224, 109, 1029, 9, 4292, 67, 2, 701, 1905, 448, 547, 299, 76, 104, 1282, 1, 134, 140, 11, 109, 9, 46, 525, 19, 13, 488, 195, 511, 1, 9686, 134, 140, 224, 1029, 9, 31634, 27, 4292, 326, 6820, 15, 46052, 1048, 241, 1, 1542, 910, 4, 361, 30, 10, 204, 5, 500, 1, 3, 3521, 1382, 525, 95, 9, 26, 743, 673, 4292, 67, 2, 701, 1905, 448, 68, 40, 999, 6, 3723, 59, 9686, 134, 2, 134, 23, 3, 877, 1, 888, 9686, 134, 2744, 6, 514, 110, 2, 2920, 910]",2120.0,20495535,105

Safety and efficacy of curative intent surgery for peri-ampullary liver metastasis.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2010-09-01,"The management of patients with peri-ampullary liver metastasis remains controversial. We sought to assess the safety and efficacy of curative intent surgery for peri-ampullary liver metastasis. Between 1993 and 2009, 40 patients underwent curative intent surgery (resection and/or radiofrequency ablation (RFA)) for peri-ampullary liver metastasis. Clinicopathologic and outcome data were collected and analyzed. Location of the primary tumor was pancreas head (n = 20), ampulla of Vater (n = 10), distal bile duct (n = 5), or duodenum (n = 5). Most patients (n = 27) presented with synchronous disease, while 13 patients presented with metachronous disease following a median disease-free interval of 22 months. Most patients (n = 25) presented with hepatic metastasis from pancreaticobiliary origin (pancreatic or distal common bile duct) compared with 15 patients who had metastasis from an intestinal-type primary (ampullary or duodenal). There were no differences in metastatic tumor number or size between these groups (P > 0.05). Post-operative morbidity and mortality was 30% and 5% respectively. Overall 1- and 3-year survival was 55% and 18%. Patients who underwent resection of liver metastasis from intestinal-type tumors experienced a longer survival compared with patients who had pancreaticobiliary lesions (median: 13 months vs. 23 months; P = 0.05).

"Gallbladder cancer: differences in presentation, surgical treatment, and survival in patients treated at centers in three countries.",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,J. Am. Coll.

The aim was to assess for location-specific differences in presentation and outcomes, which might suggest differences in pathogenesis or disease biology. Data for consecutive patients submitted to operation at Instituto Oncológico Fundación Arturo López Pérez (FALP, Chile), Yokohama City University (YCU, Japan), and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC, USA) between 1999 and 2007 were studied retrospectively. Patient demographics, disease- and treatment-related variables and outcomes were analyzed by chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, and log-rank test. Two hundred sixty-one patients (MSKCC, 130; FALP, 85; YCU, 46) underwent exploration, and 160 (MSKCC, 91; FALP, 33; YCU, 36) underwent R0 resection. Patients treated at FALP were younger (median 57 years, p < 0.001) and more often female (80%, p < 0.005); at YCU there were fewer patients with incidental tumors (19.5% compared with more than 60% at FALP and MSKCC, p < 0.001). En bloc liver and bile duct resections were performed more commonly at MSKCC and YCU (p < 0.001). Patients treated at FALP had more advanced tumor stage compared with those treated at MSKCC and YCU (p < 0.001). Disease-specific survival (DSS) was not different among the groups when patients submitted to an R0 resection were analyzed (p = 0.12).

New staging system and a registry for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma.,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",Hepatology,2011-04-01,"Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma is one of the most challenging diseases with poor overall survival. The major problem for anyone trying to convincingly compare studies among centers or over time is the lack of a reliable staging system. The most commonly used system is the Bismuth-Corlette classification of bile duct involvement, which, however, does not include crucial information such as vascular encasement and distant metastases. Other systems are rarely used because they do not provide several key pieces of information guiding therapy. Therefore, we have designed a new system reporting the size of the tumor, the extent of the disease in the biliary system, the involvement of the hepatic artery and portal vein, the involvement of lymph nodes, distant metastases, and the volume of the putative remnant liver after resection. The aim of this system is the standardization of the reporting of perihilar cholangiocarcinoma so that relevant information regarding resectability, indications for liver transplantation, and prognosis can be provided. With this tool, we have created a new registry enabling every center to prospectively enter data on their patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma (www.cholangioca.org).

Accurate staging for gallbladder cancer: implications for surgical therapy and pathological assessment.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2011-08-01,"This study evaluates the significance of tumor involvement of the liver in early T-stage tumors and lymph node (LN) metastases on outcome after R0 resection of gallbladder cancer (GBCA). A prospectively maintained database, supplemented with review of the medical record, was used to identify patients who underwent a complete (R0) resection for GBCA. All patients underwent definitive surgical treatment at the initial operation (1 stage) or after initial noncurative cholecystectomy (incidental tumors, 2 stage), including partial hepatectomy and portal LN dissection, with or without bile duct and/or adjacent organ resection. Clinicopathological variables, including TNM stage, histologic tumor involvement of liver (residual or direct extension in the GB fossa or discontiguous disease), and the total number of regional LNs assessed were analyzed for their association with outcome. One hundred twenty-two patients were identified and analyzed. The median follow up period was 23 months. Liver and nodal involvement by GBCA were observed in 61 (50%) and 41(34%) patients, respectively. Among patients with T2 tumors (n = 53), 48 (91%) were incidental. Liver involvement was present in 26%, and this factor was associated with decreased recurrence-free (RFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) compared with patients with T2 tumors without liver involvement (median RFS, 12 months vs. not reached, P = 0.004, median DSS 25 months versus not reached, P = 0.003); T1b tumors (n = 10) were not associated with liver involvement. The median total lymph node count (TLNC) was 3 (range 0-20). For the entire cohort, survival of patients classified as N0 based on TLNC < 6 was significantly worse than that of N0 patients based on TLNC ≥ 6 (median RFS, 22 months versus not reached, P < 0.001, median DSS 41 months versus not reached, P < 0.001). Liver involvement and TLNC remained significant prognostic factors in a multivariate model that included TNM stage. Resection and histologic evaluation of at least 6 lymph nodes improves risk-stratification after resection of GBCA. Incidental T2 tumors are often associated with residual liver disease and should be reclassified to reflect the adverse outcome.

Imagining studies revealed intrahepatic ductal dilatation and a 5.2 cm mass in the porta hepatis that was not consistent with cholangiocarcinoma or hepatocellular carcinoma. Multiple percutaneous biopsies of the mass failed to provide a definitive diagnosis. With a high clinical suspicion of metastatic melanoma and no other evident sites of disease, operative intervention was undertaken for diagnosis and definitive treatment. Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed initially, but access to the mass was difficult, given its location.

Frequent mutation of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1 and IDH2 in cholangiocarcinoma identified through broad-based tumor genotyping.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2011-12-16,"Cancers of origin in the gallbladder and bile ducts are rarely curable with current modalities of cancer treatment. Our clinical application of broad-based mutational profiling for patients diagnosed with a gastrointestinal malignancy has led to the novel discovery of mutations in the gene encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) in tumors from a subset of patients with cholangiocarcinoma. A total of 287 tumors from gastrointestinal cancer patients (biliary tract, colorectal, gastroesophageal, liver, pancreatic, and small intestine carcinoma) were tested during routine clinical evaluation for 130 site-specific mutations within 15 cancer genes. Mutations were identified within a number of genes, including KRAS (35%), TP53 (22%), PIK3CA (10%), BRAF (7%), APC (6%), NRAS (3%), AKT1 (1%), CTNNB1 (1%), and PTEN (1%). Although mutations in the metabolic enzyme IDH1 were rare in the other common gastrointestinal malignancies in this series (2%), they were found in three tumors (25%) of an initial series of 12 biliary tract carcinomas. To better define IDH1 and IDH2 mutational status, an additional 75 gallbladder and bile duct cancers were examined. Combining these cohorts of biliary cancers, mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 were found only in cholangiocarcinomas of intrahepatic origin (nine of 40, 23%) and in none of the 22 extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and none of the 25 gallbladder carcinomas. In an analysis of frozen tissue specimens, IDH1 mutation was associated with highly elevated tissue levels of the enzymatic product 2-hydroxyglutarate. Thus, IDH1 mutation is a molecular feature of cholangiocarcinomas of intrahepatic origin.

The impact of portal vein resection on outcomes for hilar cholangiocarcinoma: a multi-institutional analysis of 305 cases.,Cancer,Cancer,2012-03-13,"BACKGROUND. Surgical strategy for hilar cholangiocarcinoma often includes hepatectomy, but the role of portal vein resection (PVR) remains controversial. In this study, the authors sought to identify factors associated with outcome after surgical management of hilar cholangiocarcinoma and examined the impact of PVR on survival. Three hundred five patients who underwent curative-intent surgery for hilar cholangiocarcinoma between 1984 and 2010 were identified from an international, multi-institutional database. Clinicopathologic data were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Most patients had hilar cholangiocarcinoma with tumors classified as T3/T4 (51.1%) and Bismuth-Corlette type II/III (60.9%). Resection involved extrahepatic bile duct resection (EHBR) alone (26.6%); or hepatectomy and EHBR without PVR (56.7%); or combined hepatectomy, EHBR, and PVR (16.7%). Negative resection (R0) margin status was higher among the patients who underwent hepatectomy plus EHBR (without PVR, 64.2%; with PVR, 66.7%) versus EHBR alone (54.3%; P < .001). The median number of lymph nodes assessed was higher among the patients who underwent hepatectomy plus EHBR (without PVR, 6 lymph nodes; with PVR, 4 lymph nodes) versus EHBR alone (2 lymph nodes; P < .001). The 90-day mortality rate was lower for patients who underwent EHBR alone (1.2%) compared with the rate for patients who underwent hepatectomy plus EHBR (without PVR, 10.6%, with PVR, 17.6%; P < .001). The overall 5-year survival rate was 20.2%. Factors that were associated with an adverse prognosis included lymph node metastasis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.79; P = .002) and R1 margin status (HR, 1.81; P < .001). Microscopic vascular invasion did not influence survival (HR, 1.23; P = .19). Among the patients who underwent hepatectomy plus EHBR, PVR was not associated with a worse long-term outcome (P = .76). EHBR alone was associated with a greater risk of positive surgical margins and worse lymph node clearance. The current results indicated that hepatectomy should be considered the standard treatment for hilar cholangiocarcinoma, and PVR should be undertaken when necessary to extirpate all disease. Combined hepatectomy, EHBR, and PVR can offer long-term survival in some patients with advanced hilar cholangiocarcinoma.",Comparative Study,2870.0,102.0,BACKGROUND Surgical strategy for hilar cholangiocarcinoma often includes hepatectomy but the role of portal vein resection PVR remains controversial In this study the authors sought to identify factors associated with outcome after surgical management of hilar cholangiocarcinoma and examined the impact of PVR on survival Three hundred five patients who underwent curative-intent surgery for hilar cholangiocarcinoma between 1984 and 2010 were identified from an international multi-institutional database Clinicopathologic data were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses Most patients had hilar cholangiocarcinoma with tumors classified as T3/T4 51.1 and Bismuth-Corlette type II/III 60.9 Resection involved extrahepatic duct resection EHBR alone 26.6 or hepatectomy and EHBR without PVR 56.7 or combined hepatectomy EHBR and PVR 16.7 Negative resection R0 margin status was higher among the patients who underwent hepatectomy plus EHBR without PVR 64.2 with PVR 66.7 versus EHBR alone 54.3 P .001 The median number of lymph nodes assessed was higher among the patients who underwent hepatectomy plus EHBR without PVR 6 lymph nodes with PVR 4 lymph nodes versus EHBR alone 2 lymph nodes P .001 The 90-day mortality rate was lower for patients who underwent EHBR alone 1.2 compared with the rate for patients who underwent hepatectomy plus EHBR without PVR 10.6 with PVR 17.6 P .001 The overall 5-year survival rate was 20.2 Factors that were associated with an adverse prognosis included lymph node metastasis hazard ratio HR 1.79 P .002 and R1 margin status HR 1.81 P .001 Microscopic vascular invasion did not influence survival HR 1.23 P .19 Among the patients who underwent hepatectomy plus EHBR PVR was not associated with a worse long-term outcome P .76 EHBR alone was associated with a greater risk of positive surgical margins and worse lymph node clearance The current results indicated that hepatectomy should be considered the standard treatment for hilar cholangiocarcinoma and PVR should be undertaken when necessary to extirpate all disease Combined hepatectomy EHBR and PVR can offer long-term survival in some patients with advanced hilar cholangiocarcinoma,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2426, 221, 692, 9, 4793, 2126, 629, 1920, 2711, 84, 3, 200, 1, 3307, 2762, 170, 11524, 469, 2010, 4, 26, 45, 3, 738, 990, 6, 255, 130, 41, 5, 228, 50, 221, 284, 1, 4793, 2126, 2, 409, 3, 345, 1, 11524, 23, 25, 169, 1128, 365, 7, 54, 208, 1075, 1697, 152, 9, 4793, 2126, 59, 6036, 2, 1120, 11, 108, 29, 35, 944, 1414, 1115, 609, 1399, 74, 11, 194, 75, 880, 2, 331, 318, 96, 7, 42, 4793, 2126, 5, 57, 1373, 22, 2065, 2463, 725, 14, 2, 22291, 46531, 267, 215, 316, 335, 83, 170, 646, 3710, 2920, 170, 20767, 279, 432, 49, 15, 2711, 2, 20767, 187, 11524, 664, 67, 15, 397, 2711, 20767, 2, 11524, 245, 67, 199, 170, 2328, 959, 156, 10, 142, 107, 3, 7, 54, 208, 2711, 349, 20767, 187, 11524, 660, 18, 5, 11524, 700, 67, 185, 20767, 279, 667, 27, 19, 144, 3, 52, 207, 1, 263, 502, 275, 10, 142, 107, 3, 7, 54, 208, 2711, 349, 20767, 187, 11524, 49, 263, 502, 5, 11524, 39, 263, 502, 185, 20767, 279, 18, 263, 502, 19, 144, 3, 424, 218, 282, 116, 10, 280, 9, 7, 54, 208, 20767, 279, 14, 18, 72, 5, 3, 116, 9, 7, 54, 208, 2711, 349, 20767, 187, 11524, 79, 49, 5, 11524, 269, 49, 19, 144, 3, 63, 33, 111, 25, 116, 10, 179, 18, 130, 17, 11, 41, 5, 35, 290, 356, 159, 263, 289, 278, 360, 197, 168, 14, 842, 19, 1111, 2, 3239, 959, 156, 168, 14, 865, 19, 144, 2984, 756, 578, 205, 44, 1054, 25, 168, 14, 382, 19, 326, 107, 3, 7, 54, 208, 2711, 349, 20767, 11524, 10, 44, 41, 5, 8, 639, 319, 337, 228, 19, 846, 20767, 279, 10, 41, 5, 8, 378, 43, 1, 109, 221, 1012, 2, 639, 263, 289, 1960, 3, 291, 99, 1103, 17, 2711, 257, 40, 515, 3, 260, 24, 9, 4793, 2126, 2, 11524, 257, 40, 2789, 198, 1493, 6, 37638, 62, 34, 397, 2711, 20767, 2, 11524, 122, 1918, 319, 337, 25, 4, 476, 7, 5, 131, 4793, 2126]",2190.0,22415526,95
Intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct: a biliary equivalent to intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas?,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",Hepatology,2012-08-27,"Intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct (IPNB) is a variant of bile duct carcinoma characterized by intraductal growth and better outcome compared with the more common nodular-sclerosing type. IPNB is a recognized precursor of invasive carcinoma, but its pathogenesis and natural history are ill-defined. This study examines the clinicopathologic features and outcomes of IPNB. A consecutive cohort of patients with bile duct cancer (hilar, intrahepatic, or distal) was reviewed, and those with papillary histologic features identified. Histopathologic findings and immunohistochemical staining for tumor markers and for cytokeratin and mucin proteins were used to classify IPNB into subtypes. Survival data were analyzed and correlated with clinical and pathologic parameters. Thirty-nine IPNBs were identified in hilar (23/144), intrahepatic (4/86), and distal (12/113) bile duct specimens between 1991 and 2010. Histopathologic examination revealed 27 pancreatobiliary, four gastric, two intestinal, and six oncocytic subtypes; results of cytokeratin and mucin staining were similar to those of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas. Invasive carcinoma was seen in 29/39 (74%) IPNBs. Overall median survival was 62 months and was not different between IPNB locations or subtypes. Factors associated with a worse median survival included presence and depth of tumor invasion, margin-positive resection, and expression of MUC1 and CEA. IPNBs are an uncommon variant of bile duct cancer, representing approximately 10% of all resectable cases. They occur throughout the biliary tract, share some histologic and clinical features with IPMNs of the pancreas, and may represent a carcinogenesis pathway different from that of conventional bile duct carcinomas arising from flat dysplasia. Given their significant risk of harboring invasive carcinoma, they should be treated with complete resection.",Comparative Study,2703.0,134.0,Intraductal papillary neoplasm of the duct IPNB is a variant of duct carcinoma characterized by intraductal growth and better outcome compared with the more common nodular-sclerosing type IPNB is a recognized precursor of invasive carcinoma but its pathogenesis and natural history are ill-defined This study examines the clinicopathologic features and outcomes of IPNB A consecutive cohort of patients with duct cancer hilar intrahepatic or distal was reviewed and those with papillary histologic features identified Histopathologic findings and immunohistochemical staining for tumor markers and for cytokeratin and mucin proteins were used to classify IPNB into subtypes Survival data were analyzed and correlated with clinical and pathologic parameters Thirty-nine IPNBs were identified in hilar 23/144 intrahepatic 4/86 and distal 12/113 duct specimens between 1991 and 2010 Histopathologic examination revealed 27 pancreatobiliary four two intestinal and six oncocytic subtypes results of cytokeratin and mucin staining were similar to those of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm IPMN of the Invasive carcinoma was seen in 29/39 74 IPNBs Overall median survival was 62 months and was not different between IPNB locations or subtypes Factors associated with a worse median survival included presence and depth of tumor invasion margin-positive resection and expression of MUC1 and CEA IPNBs are an uncommon variant of duct cancer representing approximately 10 of all resectable cases They occur throughout the biliary tract share some histologic and clinical features with IPMNs of the and may represent a carcinogenesis pathway different from that of conventional duct carcinomas arising from flat dysplasia Given their significant risk of harboring invasive carcinoma they should be treated with complete resection,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4851, 1796, 2131, 1, 3, 2920, 27175, 16, 8, 1142, 1, 2920, 134, 765, 20, 4851, 129, 2, 380, 228, 72, 5, 3, 80, 186, 4481, 6782, 267, 27175, 16, 8, 1904, 2765, 1, 416, 134, 84, 211, 1384, 2, 1504, 532, 32, 4993, 395, 26, 45, 4468, 3, 1399, 404, 2, 123, 1, 27175, 8, 935, 180, 1, 7, 5, 2920, 12, 4793, 3022, 15, 2107, 10, 446, 2, 135, 5, 1796, 884, 404, 108, 2630, 272, 2, 1382, 1029, 9, 30, 525, 2, 9, 4292, 2, 5258, 652, 11, 95, 6, 4896, 27175, 237, 814, 25, 74, 11, 311, 2, 438, 5, 38, 2, 510, 1038, 977, 762, 25432, 11, 108, 4, 4793, 382, 4415, 3022, 39, 868, 2, 2107, 133, 4259, 2920, 623, 59, 3372, 2, 1120, 2630, 1385, 553, 428, 9206, 294, 100, 3077, 2, 437, 17287, 814, 99, 1, 4292, 2, 5258, 1029, 11, 288, 6, 135, 1, 4851, 1796, 2391, 2131, 4398, 1, 3, 416, 134, 10, 527, 4, 462, 587, 794, 25432, 63, 52, 25, 10, 744, 53, 2, 10, 44, 338, 59, 27175, 4069, 15, 814, 130, 41, 5, 8, 639, 52, 25, 159, 463, 2, 2436, 1, 30, 578, 959, 109, 170, 2, 55, 1, 4994, 2, 3088, 25432, 32, 35, 2052, 1142, 1, 2920, 12, 2861, 705, 79, 1, 62, 1899, 140, 491, 1271, 2432, 3, 2532, 1696, 4349, 476, 884, 2, 38, 404, 5, 5884, 1, 3, 2, 68, 1231, 8, 1719, 308, 338, 29, 17, 1, 809, 2920, 826, 2635, 29, 7767, 2253, 447, 136, 93, 43, 1, 2105, 416, 134, 491, 257, 40, 73, 5, 236, 170]",1826.0,22504729,9
GNAS codon 201 mutations are uncommon in intraductal papillary neoplasms of the bile duct.,HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association,HPB (Oxford),2012-06-18,"Activating point mutations of GNAS at codon 201 have been detected in approximately two thirds of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas. Intraductal papillary neoplasms of the bile ducts (IPNBs) morphologically resemble pancreatic IPMNs. This study sought to assess the mutational status of GNAS at codon 201 in IPNBs. Thirty-four patients were included. DNA from microdissected IPNBs was subjected to a polymerase chain reaction and ligation method for the detection of GNAS mutations at codon 201 and of KRAS mutations at codon 12. Mutational status was compared with clinical and pathologic data. The IPNBs had a median diameter of 3.5 cm and were located intrahepatically (n= 6), extrahepatically (n= 13), both intra- and extrahepatically (n= 4) or in the gallbladder (intracystic papillary neoplasms, n= 11). Most exhibited pancreatobiliary differentiation (n= 20), high-grade dysplasia (n= 26) and an associated adenocarcinoma (n= 20). Analysis of GNAS codon 201 identified only one mutant sample in a multifocal intestinal subtype intrahepatic IPNB with high-grade dysplasia. Six lesions harboured a KRAS codon 12 mutation.

Adjuvant therapy for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: the debate continues.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2012-12-07,"Presentation of the Case A 37-year-old woman presented at 35 weeks of gestation with her third child with failure to adequately gain weight and was noted by her obstetrician to have delay in the growth of her baby. Ultrasound of the abdomen incidentally revealed the presence of a liver lesion. After additional evaluation, she ultimately delivered her daughter at 36 weeks uneventfully. She subsequently underwent additional evaluation. Liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 5-cm solitary solid mass in segment 4A of the liver, concerning for malignancy. Serum α-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, cancer antigen (CA)19-9, CA15-3, and CA125 were all normal. Liver biopsy was positive for adenocarcinoma. The tumor cells demonstrated a phenotype suggesting a possible breast primary, although the immunohistochemistry did not support that diagnosis and the tumor was negative for mammaglobin, gross cystic disease fluid protein (GCDFP)-15, estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PR) (Table 1). The tumor was also CDX2 and cardiotrophin-1 negative, but cytokeratin (CK) 19 positive. Her endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, breast mammogram, and breast MRI were completely normal. A positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan showed a fluorodeoxyglucose-avid 5.8-cm × 6.0-cm hypoattenuating lesion with peripheral enhancement involving segment 4 and segment 8 at the dome. In addition, central necrosis within the lesion was noted. The left main portal vein was mildly attenuated by the mass. She eventually underwent a left hepatectomy en bloc with caudate resection, portal lymphadenectomy, cholecystectomy, and omental pedicle flap. On exploration of the abdomen, no additional disease was noted. The final pathology revealed a 9.4-cm moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the intrahepatic bile ducts. Venous invasion was present. Perineural invasion was absent. The margins were negative. Thirteen lymph nodes were obtained, all of which were negative, consistent with a stage T2, N0, MX intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

2564 resected periampullary adenocarcinomas at a single institution: trends over three decades.,HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association,HPB (Oxford),2013-03-08,"This study was carried out to determine relative survival rates and trends in outcomes in patients who underwent resection of periampullary adenocarcinomas (PACs) with curative intent at a single institution over the last three decades. From 1980 to 2011, 2564 pancreaticoduodenectomies (PDs) were performed for PACs. Pathological diagnosis, therapy and survival were retrospectively analysed. The primary sites included the pancreas (66%), ampulla (16%), bile duct (12%) and duodenum (6%). Operation volume increased from 11 per year in the 1980s to 135 per year in the 2000s (P < 0.001). Patients in the 1980s were younger (median age: 64 years; range: 33-90 years) than those in the 1990s (median age: 68 years; range: 31-103 years) and 2000s (median age: 68 years; range: 24-93 years) (P < 0.001). Over time, the frequency of a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer arising from intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm increased from 2% in the 1980s to 8% in the 2000s (P < 0.001). The rate of 30-day mortality after surgery in the 1980s was 2%, which was similar to rates in the 1990s (1%) and 2000s (1%). Survival in each type of PAC did not change over time. Pancreatic cancer was associated with the worst survival (median survival: 19 months) compared with adenocarcinomas of the ampulla (median survival: 47 months), bile duct (median survival: 23 months) and duodenum (median survival: 54 months) (P < 0.001).

Eligible patients had breast cancer with impaired liver function secondary to hepatic metastases and were candidates for docetaxel therapy. They were assigned to one of five groups on the basis of total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase levels. All other causes of liver dysfunction were excluded, and bile duct obstruction was corrected, if possible, prior to study entry. Patients received docetaxel every three weeks. The chemotherapy dose was chosen on the basis of the patient's level of hepatic dysfunction and escalated as tolerated. The primary outcome of this study was safety. The secondary outcomes were pharmacokinetic data and efficacy in terms of time to disease progression. Twenty-three patients were enrolled. No unexpected toxicities occurred.

Gene expression profiling of ampullary carcinomas classifies ampullary carcinomas into biliary-like and intestinal-like subtypes that are prognostic of outcome.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2013-06-11,"Adenocarcinomas of the ampulla of Vater are classified as biliary cancers, though the exact epithelium of origin for these cancers is not known. We sought to molecularly classify ampullary adenocarcinomas in comparison to known adenocarcinomas of the pancreas, bile duct, and duodenum by gene expression analysis. We analyzed 32 fresh-frozen resected, untreated periampullary adenocarcinomas (8 pancreatic, 2 extrahepatic biliary, 8 duodenal, and 14 ampullary) using the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 genome array. Unsupervised and supervised hierarchical clustering identified two subtypes of ampullary carcinomas that were molecularly and histologically characterized. Hierarchical clustering of periampullary carcinomas segregated ampullary carcinomas into two subgroups, which were distinctly different from pancreatic carcinomas. Non-pancreatic periampullary adenocarcinomas were segregated into two subgroups with differing prognoses: 5 year RFS (77% vs. 0%, p = 0.007) and 5 year OS (100% vs. 35%, p = 0.005). Unsupervised clustering analysis of the 14 ampullary samples also identified two subgroups: a good prognosis intestinal-like subgroup and a poor prognosis biliary-like subgroup with 5 year OS of 70% vs. 28%, P = 0.09. Expression of CK7+/CK20- but not CDX-2 correlated with these two subgroups. Activation of the AKT and MAPK pathways were both increased in the poor prognostic biliary-like subgroup. In an independent 80 patient ampullary validation dataset only histological subtype (intestinal vs. pancreaticobiliary) was significantly associated with OS in both univariate (p = 0.006) and multivariate analysis (P = 0.04).

Early detection of metachronous bile duct cancer in Lynch syndrome: report of a case.,Surgery today,Surg. Today,2013-07-31,"Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease associated with a high incidence of colorectal, endometrial, stomach, ovarian, pancreatic, ureter and renal pelvis, bile duct and brain tumors. The syndrome can also include sebaceous gland adenomas and keratoacanthomas, and carcinoma of the small bowel. The lifetime risk for bile duct cancer in patients with Lynch syndrome is approximately 2 %. The present report describes a case of Lynch syndrome with metachronous bile duct cancer diagnosed at an early stage. The patient was a 73-year-old Japanese male who underwent a successful left lobectomy of the liver, and there was no sign of recurrence for 2 years postoperative. However, this patient harbored a germline mutation in MLH1, which prompted diagnostic examinations for noncolorectal tumors when a periodic surveillance blood examination showed abnormal values of hepatobiliary enzymes. Although most patients with bile duct cancer are diagnosed at an advanced stage, the bile duct cancer was diagnosed at an early stage in the present patient due to the observation of the gene mutation and the preceding liver tumor.

Systematic use of an intraoperative air leak test at the time of major liver resection reduces the rate of postoperative biliary complications.,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,J. Am. Coll. Surg.,2013-12-01,"After hepatectomy, bile leaks remain a major cause of morbidity, cost, and disability. This study was designed to determine if a novel intraoperative air leak test (ALT) would reduce the incidence of post-hepatectomy biliary complications. Rates of postoperative biliary complications were compared among 103 patients who underwent ALT and 120 matched patients operated on before ALT was used. All study patients underwent major hepatectomy without bile duct resection at 3 high-volume hepatobiliary centers between 2008 and 2012. The ALT was performed by placement of a transcystic cholangiogram catheter to inject air into the biliary tree, the upper abdomen was filled with saline, and the distal common bile duct was manually occluded. Uncontrolled bile ducts were identified by localization of air bubbles at the transection surface and were directly repaired. The 2 groups were similar in diagnosis, chemotherapy use, tumor number and size, resection extent, surgery duration, and blood loss (all, p > 0.05). Single or multiple uncontrolled bile ducts were intraoperatively detected and repaired in 62.1% of ALT vs 8.3% of non-ALT patients (p < 0.001).

Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition attenuates liver fibrosis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",Hepatology,2014-02-28,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most rapidly increasing cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. Because of the lack of viable treatment options for HCC, prevention in high-risk patients has been proposed as an alternative strategy. The main risk factor for HCC is cirrhosis and several lines of evidence implicate epidermal growth factor (EGF) in the progression of cirrhosis and development of HCC. We therefore examined the effects of the EGF receptor (EGFR) inhibitor erlotinib on liver fibrogenesis and hepatocellular transformation in three different animal models of progressive cirrhosis: a rat model induced by repeated, low-dose injections of diethylnitrosamine (DEN), a mouse model induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4 ), and a rat model induced by bile duct ligation (BDL). Erlotinib reduced EGFR phosphorylation in hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and reduced the total number of activated HSC. Erlotinib also decreased hepatocyte proliferation and liver injury. Consistent with all these findings, pharmacological inhibition of EGFR signaling effectively prevented the progression of cirrhosis and regressed fibrosis in some animals. Moreover, by alleviating the underlying liver disease, erlotinib blocked the development of HCC and its therapeutic efficacy could be monitored with a previously reported gene expression signature predictive of HCC risk in human cirrhosis patients. These data suggest that EGFR inhibition using Food and Drug Administration-approved inhibitors provides a promising therapeutic approach for reduction of fibrogenesis and prevention of HCC in high-risk cirrhosis patients who can be identified and monitored by gene expression signatures.",Journal Article,2153.0,145.0,carcinoma HCC is the most rapidly increasing cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States Because of the lack of viable treatment options for HCC prevention in high-risk patients has been proposed as an alternative strategy The main risk factor for HCC is cirrhosis and several lines of evidence implicate epidermal growth factor EGF in the progression of cirrhosis and development of HCC We therefore examined the effects of the EGF receptor EGFR inhibitor erlotinib on fibrogenesis and transformation in three different animal models of progressive cirrhosis a rat model induced by repeated low-dose injections of diethylnitrosamine DEN a mouse model induced by carbon tetrachloride CCl4 and a rat model induced by duct ligation BDL Erlotinib reduced EGFR phosphorylation in hepatic stellate cells HSC and reduced the total number of activated HSC Erlotinib also decreased proliferation and injury Consistent with all these findings pharmacological inhibition of EGFR signaling effectively prevented the progression of cirrhosis and regressed fibrosis in some animals Moreover by alleviating the underlying disease erlotinib blocked the development of HCC and its therapeutic efficacy could be monitored with a previously reported gene expression signature predictive of HCC risk in human cirrhosis patients These data suggest that EGFR inhibition using Food and Drug Administration-approved inhibitors provides a promising therapeutic approach for reduction of fibrogenesis and prevention of HCC in high-risk cirrhosis patients who can be identified and monitored by gene expression signatures,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[134, 663, 16, 3, 96, 1755, 602, 708, 1, 12, 139, 282, 4, 3, 1088, 907, 408, 1, 3, 926, 1, 2663, 24, 838, 9, 663, 1070, 4, 64, 43, 7, 71, 85, 1587, 22, 35, 1091, 692, 3, 1895, 43, 161, 9, 663, 16, 3563, 2, 392, 285, 1, 241, 5545, 829, 129, 161, 3114, 4, 3, 91, 1, 3563, 2, 193, 1, 663, 21, 673, 409, 3, 176, 1, 3, 3114, 153, 227, 230, 962, 23, 40664, 2, 1392, 4, 169, 338, 2026, 274, 1, 1014, 3563, 8, 4008, 202, 277, 20, 2113, 154, 61, 4344, 1, 26799, 32263, 8, 830, 202, 277, 20, 5183, 35780, 12660, 2, 8, 4008, 202, 277, 20, 2920, 5307, 27357, 962, 405, 227, 982, 4, 939, 9528, 37, 5596, 2, 405, 3, 181, 207, 1, 735, 5596, 962, 120, 340, 457, 2, 2730, 925, 5, 62, 46, 272, 3419, 297, 1, 227, 314, 1856, 3902, 3, 91, 1, 3563, 2, 12579, 3000, 4, 476, 2258, 1393, 20, 12956, 3, 1181, 34, 962, 2582, 3, 193, 1, 663, 2, 211, 189, 209, 359, 40, 2909, 5, 8, 373, 210, 145, 55, 1651, 464, 1, 663, 43, 4, 171, 3563, 7, 46, 74, 309, 17, 227, 297, 75, 1773, 2, 234, 634, 850, 222, 777, 8, 721, 189, 353, 9, 628, 1, 40664, 2, 1070, 1, 663, 4, 64, 43, 3563, 7, 54, 122, 40, 108, 2, 2909, 20, 145, 55, 2210]",1606.0,24677197,46

Treatment and Prognosis for Patients With Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,JAMA surgery,JAMA Surg,2014-06-01,"Data on outcomes following surgical management of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) are limited. The incidence of ICC is increasing and it has a poor prognosis. No consensus has been reached regarding the optimal treatment modalities. To systematically review and synthesize the available evidence regarding treatment and prognosis in patients with ICC. The PubMed database was searched for relevant articles published between January 1, 2000, and April 1, 2013. Only studies assessing predictors of survival or recurrence in patients undergoing curative-intent surgical treatment of ICC were included. Small series, studies reporting on mixed types of cholangiocarcinoma, or exclusively on hepatolithiasis-associated cholangiocarcinoma, and those published in a language other than English, French, German, Italian, or Greek, were excluded. Fifty-seven of 960 articles were therefore analyzed. Data on preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were extracted by 3 independent reviewers. Multiple studies reporting on the same population were excluded. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. We hypothesized that preoperative variables and tumor characteristics affect patient survival. The outcomes of the study were overall survival and recurrence-free survival. The hypothesis was formulated before data collection. Fifty-seven studies (4756 patients) were included in the review. Median patient age ranged from 49 to 67 years, and 57% were male. Most patients had a solitary (69%), large (median size, 4.5-8.0 cm) tumor of the mass-forming type (86%). Approximately one-third of the patients had lymph node metastasis (34%) or vascular (38%), perineural (29%), or biliary invasion (29%). Most underwent a major hepatectomy (82%), often accompanied by lymphadenectomy (67%) and sometimes by extrahepatic bile duct resection (23%). Median and 5-year overall survival (OS) generally were approximately 28 months (range, 9-53 months) and 30% (range, 5%-56%), respectively; factors predicting shorter OS included large tumor size, multiple tumors, lymph node metastasis, and vascular invasion. Adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy did not appear to be beneficial. Seven studies (2132 patients) provided data for the meta-analysis.

Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 translocations in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2014-04-13,"Patients with cholangiocarcinoma often present with locally advanced or metastatic disease. There is a need for effective therapeutic strategies for advanced stage cholangiocarcinoma. Recently, FGFR2 translocations have been identified as a potential target for tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. This study evaluated 152 cholangiocarcinomas and 4 intraductal papillary biliary neoplasms of the bile duct for presence of FGFR2 translocations by fluorescence in situ hybridization and characterized the clinicopathologic features of cases with FGFR2 translocations. Thirteen (10 women, 3 men; 8%) of 156 biliary tumors harbored FGFR2 translocations, including 12 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (12/96; 13%) and 1 intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct. Histologically, cholangiocarcinomas with FGFR2 translocations displayed prominent intraductal growth (62%) or anastomosing tubular glands with desmoplasia (38%). Immunohistochemically, the tumors with FGFR2 translocations frequently showed weak and patchy expression of CK19 (77%). Markers of the stem cell phenotype in cholangiocarcinoma, HepPar1 and CK20, were negative in all cases. The median cancer-specific survival for patients whose tumors harbored FGFR2 translocations was 123 months compared to 37 months for cases without FGFR2 translocations (P = .039). This study also assessed 100 cholangiocarcinomas for ERBB2 amplification and ROS1 translocations. Of the cases tested, 3% and 1% were positive for ERBB2 amplification and ROS1 translocation, respectively. These results confirm that FGFR2, ERRB2, and ROS1 alterations are potential therapeutic targets for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

Outcome of Transplant-fallout Patients With Unresectable Cholangiocarcinoma.,American journal of clinical oncology,Am. J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-06-01,"The aim of this was to determine survival after starting neoadjuvant therapy for patients who became ineligible for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Since January 1993, 215 patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma began treatment with planned OLT. Treatment included external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with fluorouracil, bile duct brachytherapy, and postradiotherapy fluorouracil or capecitabine before OLT. Adverse findings at the staging operation, death, and other factors precluded OLT in 63 patients (29%), of whom 61 completed neoadjuvant chemoradiation. By October 2012, 56 (89%) of the 63 patients unable to undergo OLT had died. Twenty-two patients (35%) became ineligible for OLT before the staging operation, 38 (60%) at the staging operation, and 3 (5%) after staging. From the date of diagnosis, median overall survival was 12.3 months. Survival was 17% at 18 months and 7% at 24 months. Median survival after fallout was 6.8 months. Median survival after the staging operation was 6 months. Two patients lived for 3.7 and 8.7 years before dying of cancer or liver failure caused by persistent biliary stricture at the site of the original cancer, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that time from diagnosis to fallout correlated with overall survival (P=0.04). In highly selected patients initially suitable for OLT, the mortality rate for cholangiocarcinoma was high in patients who became ineligible for OLT. Their survival, however, was comparable to expected survival for patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease treated with nontransplant therapies.

Multimodal treatment strategies for advanced hilar cholangiocarcinoma.,Langenbeck's archives of surgery,Langenbecks Arch Surg,2014-06-25,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is the second most common primary malignancy of the liver arising from malignant transformation and growth of biliary ductal epithelium. Approximately 50-70 % of CCAs arise at the hilar plate of the biliary tree, which are termed hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HC). Various staging systems are currently employed to classify HCs and determine resectability. Depending on the pre-operative staging, the mainstays of treatment include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy. Surgical resection offers the only chance for cure of HC and achieving an R0 resection has demonstrated improved overall survival. However, obtaining longitudinal and radial surgical margins that are free of tumor can be difficult and frequently requires extensive resections, particularly for advanced HCs.

Residual disease predicts outcomes after definitive resection for incidental gallbladder cancer.,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,J. Am. Coll. Surg.,2014-05-16,"Residual disease (RD) at definitive resection of incidental gallbladder cancer (IGBCA) influences outcome, but its clinical relevance with respect to anatomic site is incompletely characterized. Consecutive patients with IGBCA undergoing re-exploration from 1998 to 2009 were identified; those submitted to a complete resection were analyzed. Demographics and tumor- and treatment-related variables were correlated with RD and survival. Cancer-specific survival was stratified by site of RD (local [gallbladder bed]; regional [bile duct, lymph nodes]; distant [discontiguous liver, port site, peritoneal]). Of the 135 patients submitted to re-exploration, RD was found in 82 (61%) overall and in 63 (54%) of 116 patients submitted to resection; the most common site was regional (n = 27, 43%). The T stage of the gallbladder specimen was the only independent predictor of RD (T1b = 35.7%, T2 = 48.3%, T3 = 70%, p = 0.015). The presence of RD at any site dramatically reduced median disease-free survival (DFS) (11.2 vs 93.4 months, p < 0.0001) and disease-specific survival (DSS) (25.2 months vs not reached, p < 0.0001) compared with no RD, respectively. Disease-specific survival did not differ according to RD location, with all anatomic sites being equally poor (p = 0.87). Residual disease at any site predicted DFS (hazard ratio [HR] 3.3, 95% CI 1.9 to 5.7, p = 0.0003) and DSS (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.6, p = 0.01), independent of all other tumor-related variables.

The Ability to Diagnose Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma Definitively Using Novel Branched DNA-Enhanced Albumin RNA In Situ Hybridization Technology.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2014-12-18,"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) often is a diagnosis determined by exclusion. Distinguishing ICC from other metastatic adenocarcinomas based on histopathologic or immunohistochemical analysis often is difficult and requires an extensive workup. This study aimed to determine whether albumin, whose expression is restricted to the liver, has potential as a biomarker for ICC using a novel and highly sensitive RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) platform. Modified branched DNA probes were developed for albumin RNA ISH. The study evaluated 467 patient samples of primary and metastatic lesions. Of the 467 samples evaluated, 83 were ICCs, 42 were hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), and 332 were nonhepatic carcinomas including tumors arising from the perihilar region and bile duct, pancreas, stomach, esophagus, colon, breast, ovary, endometrium, kidney, and urinary bladder. Albumin RNA ISH was highly sensitive for cancers of liver origin, staining positive in 82 (99 %) of 83 ICCs and in 42 HCCs (100 %). Perihilar and distal bile duct carcinomas as well as carcinomas arising at other sites tested negative for albumin. Notably, 6 (22 %) of 27 intrahepatic tumors previously diagnosed as carcinomas of undetermined origin tested positive for albumin. Albumin RNA ISH is a sensitive and highly specific diagnostic tool for distinguishing ICC from metastatic adenocarcinoma to the liver or carcinoma of unknown origin.

IL-33 facilitates oncogene-induced cholangiocarcinoma in mice by an interleukin-6-sensitive mechanism.,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",Hepatology,2015-03-20,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a lethal hepatobiliary neoplasm originating from the biliary apparatus. In humans, CCA risk factors include hepatobiliary inflammation and fibrosis. The recently identified interleukin (IL)-1 family member, IL-33, has been shown to be a biliary mitogen which also promotes liver inflammation and fibrosis. Our aim was to generate a mouse model of CCA mimicking the human disease. Ectopic oncogene expression in the biliary tract was accomplished by the Sleeping Beauty transposon transfection system with transduction of constitutively active AKT (myr-AKT) and Yes-associated protein. Intrabiliary instillation of the transposon-transposase complex was coupled with lobar bile duct ligation in C57BL/6 mice, followed by administration of IL-33 for 3 consecutive days. Tumors developed in 72% of the male mice receiving both oncogenes plus IL-33 by 10 weeks but in only 20% of the male mice transduced with the oncogenes alone. Tumors expressed SOX9 and pancytokeratin (features of CCA) but were negative for HepPar1 (a marker of hepatocellular carcinoma). Substantive overlap with human CCA specimens was revealed by RNA profiling.

Analysis of free-form radiology dictations for completeness and clarity for pancreatic cancer staging.,Abdominal imaging,Abdom Imaging,2015-10-01,"To assess the completeness and clarity of current free-form radiology reports for pancreatic cancer staging by evaluating them against the elements of the RSNA CT oncology primary pancreas mass dictation template. This retrospective study was approved by our Institutional Review Board (IRB). 295 free-form computed tomography (CT) reports for baseline staging of pancreatic cancer (PC) generated between August 2008 and December 2010 were evaluated by one of two radiologists with expertise in pancreatic cancer imaging. Reports which indicated that metastatic disease was present were excluded. The completeness and clarity of the reports were analyzed against the elements of the RSNA CT pancreas mass dictation template. Fisher's exact tests were used to analyze differences by year and type of radiologist. Primary lesion location, size, and effect on bile duct (BD) were provided in 93.9% (277/295), 69.8% (206/295), and 67.5% (199/295) of reports, respectively. Standard terms to describe vascular involvement were used in 47.5% (140/295) of reports. In 20.3% (60/295), the resectability status could not be defined based on the report alone. In 36.9% (109/295) of reports, review of CT images was necessary to understand vascular involvement. Radiologists expert in pancreatic oncology had a higher proportion of reports using standardized terminology and reports in which vascular involvement was understood without revisiting the images.

Presentation and Clinical Outcomes of Choledochal Cysts in Children and Adults: A Multi-institutional Analysis.,JAMA surgery,JAMA Surg,2015-06-01,"Choledochal cysts (CCs) are rare, with risk of infection and cancer. To characterize the natural history, management, and long-term implications of CC disease. A total of 394 patients who underwent resection of a CC between January 1, 1972, and April 11, 2014, were identified from an international multi-institutional database. Patients were followed up through September 27, 2014. Clinicopathologic characteristics, operative details, and outcome data were analyzed from May 1, 2014, to October 14, 2014. Resection of CC. Management, morbidity, and overall survival. Among 394 patients, there were 135 children (34.3%) and 318 women (80.7%). Adults were more likely to present with abdominal pain (71.8% vs 40.7%; P < .001) and children were more likely to have jaundice (31.9% vs 11.6%; P < .001). Preoperative interventions were more commonly performed in adults (64.5% vs 31.1%; P < .001), including endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (55.6% vs 27.4%; P < .001), percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (17.4% vs 5.9%; P < .001), and endobiliary stenting (18.1% vs 4.4%; P < .001)). Type I CCs were more often seen in children vs adults (79.7% vs 64.9%; P = .003); type IV CCs predominated in the adult population (23.9% vs 12.0%; P = .006). Extrahepatic bile duct resection with hepaticoenterostomy was the most frequently performed procedure in both age groups (80.3%). Perioperative morbidity was higher in adults (35.1% vs 16.3%; P < .001). On pathologic examination, 10 patients (2.5%) had cholangiocarcinoma.

In summary, within high incidence areas, the assessment of routine gallbladder specimens should include the microscopic evaluation of a minimum of three sections and the cystic duct margin; specimens with dysplasia or proven cancer should be extensively sampled. Provided the patient is medically fit for surgery, data support the resection of all gallbladder polyps of >1.0 cm in diameter and those with imaging evidence of vascular stalks. The minimum staging evaluation of patients with suspected or proven gallbladder cancer includes contrasted cross-sectional imaging and diagnostic laparoscopy. Adequate lymphadenectomy includes assessment of any suspicious regional nodes, evaluation of the aortocaval nodal basin, and a goal recovery of at least six nodes. Patients with confirmed metastases to N2 nodal stations do not benefit from radical resection and should receive systemic and/or palliative treatments. Primary resection of patients with early T-stage (T1b-2) disease should include en bloc resection of adjacent liver parenchyma. Patients with T1b, T2 or T3 disease that is incidentally identified in a cholecystectomy specimen should undergo re-resection unless this is contraindicated by advanced disease or poor performance status. Re-resection should include complete portal lymphadenectomy and bile duct resection only when needed to achieve a negative margin (R0) resection. Patients with preoperatively staged T3 or T4 N1 disease should be considered for clinical trials of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Following R0 resection of T2-4 disease in N1 gallbladder cancer, patients should be considered for adjuvant systemic chemotherapy and/or chemoradiotherapy.

Hilar cholangiocarcinoma: expert consensus statement.,HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association,HPB (Oxford),2015-08-01,"An American Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association (AHPBA)-sponsored consensus meeting of expert panellists met on 15 January 2014 to review current evidence on the management of hilar cholangiocarcinoma in order to establish practice guidelines and to agree consensus statements. It was established that the treatment of patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma requires a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach to optimize the chances for both durable survival and effective palliation. An adequate diagnostic and staging work-up includes high-quality cross-sectional imaging; however, pathologic confirmation is not required prior to resection or initiation of a liver transplant trimodal treatment protocol. The ideal treatment for suitable patients with resectable hilar malignancy is resection of the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts, as well as resection of the involved ipsilateral liver. Preoperative biliary drainage is best achieved with percutaneous transhepatic approaches and may be indicated for patients with cholangitis, malnutrition or hepatic insufficiency. Portal vein embolization is a safe and effective strategy for increasing the future liver remnant (FLR) and is particularly useful for patients with an FLR of <30%. Selected patients with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma should be evaluated for a standard trimodal protocol incorporating external beam and endoluminal radiation therapy, systemic chemotherapy and liver transplantation. Post-resection chemoradiation should be offered to patients who show high-risk features on surgical pathology. Chemoradiation is also recommended for patients with locally advanced, unresectable hilar cancers. For patients with locally recurrent or metastatic hilar cholangiocarcinoma, first-line chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin is recommended based on multiple Phase II trials and a large randomized controlled trial including a heterogeneous population of patients with biliary cancers.

Preoperative biliary drainage in perihilar cholangiocarcinoma: identifying patients who require percutaneous drainage after failed endoscopic drainage.,Endoscopy,Endoscopy,2015-09-18,"Preoperative biliary drainage is often initiated with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in patients with potentially resectable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (PHC), but additional percutaneous transhepatic catheter (PTC) drainage is frequently required. This study aimed to develop and validate a prediction model to identify patients with a high risk of inadequate ERCP drainage. Patients with potentially resectable PHC and (attempted) preoperative ERCP drainage were included from two specialty center cohorts between 2001 and 2013. Indications for additional PTC drainage were failure to place an endoscopic stent, failure to relieve jaundice, cholangitis, or insufficient drainage of the future liver remnant. A prediction model was derived from the European cohort and externally validated in the USA cohort. Of the 288 patients, 108 (38%) required additional preoperative PTC drainage after inadequate ERCP drainage. Independent risk factors for additional PTC drainage were proximal biliary obstruction on preoperative imaging (Bismuth 3 or 4) and predrainage total bilirubin level. The prediction model identified three subgroups: patients with low risk (7%), moderate risk (40%), and high risk (62%). The high-risk group consisted of patients with a total bilirubin level above 150 µmol/L and Bismuth 3a or 4 tumors, who typically require preoperative drainage of the angulated left bile ducts.

Recurrence Rate and Pattern of Perihilar Cholangiocarcinoma after Curative Intent Resection.,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,J. Am. Coll. Surg.,2015-09-15,"The aim of this study was to investigate the rate and pattern of recurrence after curative intent resection of perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (PHC). Patients were included from 2 prospectively maintained databases. Recurrences were categorized by site. Time to recurrence and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to identify independent poor prognostic factors. Between 1991 and 2012, 306 consecutive patients met inclusion criteria. Median overall survival was 40 months. A recurrence was diagnosed in 177 patients (58%). An initial local recurrence was found in 26% of patients: liver hilum (11%), hepaticojejunostomy (8%), liver resection margin (8%), or distal bile duct remnant (2%). An initial distant recurrence was observed in 40% of patients: retroperitoneal lymph nodes (14%), intrahepatic away from the resection margin (13%), peritoneum (12%), and lungs (8%). Only 18% of patients had an isolated initial local recurrence. The estimated overall recurrence rate was 76% at 8 years. After a recurrence-free period of 5 years, 28% of patients developed a recurrence in the next 3 years. Median RFS was 26 months. Independent prognostic factors for RFS were resection margin, lymph node status, and tumor differentiation. Only node-positive PHC precluded RFS beyond 7 years. Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma will recur in most patients (76%) after resection, emphasizing the need for better adjuvant strategies. The high recurrence rate of up to 8 years justifies prolonged surveillance. Only patients with an isolated initial local recurrence (18%) may have benefited from a more extensive resection or liver transplantation.

A multi-institutional analysis of 429 patients undergoing major hepatectomy for colorectal cancer liver metastases: The impact of concomitant bile duct resection on survival.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2015-09-10,"Data are lacking on long-term outcomes of patients undergoing major hepatectomy requiring bile duct resection (BDR) for the treatment of colorectal cancer liver metastases. Patients who underwent major hepatectomy (≥3 segments) for metastatic colorectal cancer from 2000-2010 at three US academic institutions were included. The primary outcome was disease-specific survival (DSS). Of 429 patients, nine (2.1%) underwent BDR, which was associated with pre-operative portal vein embolization (25.0% vs. 4.3%; P = 0.049). There were no significant differences in age, ASA class, margin status, number of lesions, tumor size, cirrhosis, perineural invasion, or lymphovascular invasion. BDR was independently associated with increased postoperative major complications (OR: 6.22; 95%CI:1.44-26.97; P = 0.015). There were no differences in length of stay, reoperation, readmission, or 30-day mortality. Patients who underwent BDR had markedly decreased DSS (9.3 vs. 39.9 mo; P = 0.002). When accounting for differences between the two groups, the need for BDR was independently associated with reduced DSS (HR: 3.06; 95%CI:1.12-8.34; P = 0.029). Major hepatectomy with concomitant bile duct resection is seldom performed in patients undergoing resection of colorectal cancer liver metastases and is associated with higher major morbidity and reduced disease-specific survival compared to major hepatectomy alone.

Ampullary Cancers Harbor ELF3 Tumor Suppressor Gene Mutations and Exhibit Frequent WNT Dysregulation.,Cell reports,Cell Rep,2016-01-21,"The ampulla of Vater is a complex cellular environment from which adenocarcinomas arise to form a group of histopathologically heterogenous tumors. To evaluate the molecular features of these tumors, 98 ampullary adenocarcinomas were evaluated and compared to 44 distal bile duct and 18 duodenal adenocarcinomas. Genomic analyses revealed mutations in the WNT signaling pathway among half of the patients and in all three adenocarcinomas irrespective of their origin and histological morphology.

"Intra-pancreatic Distal Bile Duct Carcinoma is Morphologically, Genetically, and Clinically Distinct from Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,J. Gastrointest. Surg.,2016-03-08,"Differentiating intra-pancreatic distal bile duct carcinoma invading the pancreas from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) surrounding the distal common bile duct (CBD) can be challenging. Our aim is to identify clinical, morphological, and genetic features characteristic of intra-pancreatic distal bile duct carcinoma. Clinicopathologic data of 550 patients undergoing a pancreaticoduodenectomy between September 1990 and May 2008 were reviewed. KRAS status was assessed with mass-spectrometric genotyping. Ninety-seven patients with intra-pancreatic adenocarcinomas surrounding the CBD were identified; slides were available for 80. Two relationships with the CBD were recognized as follows: type I (n = 42): cancer grew concentrically around the CBD and type II (n = 38): cancer grew asymmetrically around the CBD. Type I adenocarcinomas were associated with high-grade biliary dysplasia (45 vs. 13 %; p = 0.003); type II were associated with high-grade pancreatic intra-epithelial neoplasia (PanIN-2 or -3) (39 vs. 9 %; p = 0.003). Type I tumors had a better median survival (46 months) compared to type II (23 months) or other PDAC (20 months) (p < 0.001). Mutated KRAS was identified in 3/26 (11 %) type I and 20/21 (95 %) type II cancers (p < 0.001). There may be poorer survival in the presence of a KRAS mutation than wild-type KRAS (22.9 vs. 41.6 months; p = 0.3). Distal periductal adenocarcinomas fall into two distinct groups with biologic, morphologic and genetic differences. Those growing symmetrically around the CBD are more likely to be intra-pancreatic distal bile duct carcinomas and are associated with improved survival whereas cancers with asymmetric growth are more likely to have KRAS mutations and to be PDACs.

The Role of Biliary Carcinoembryonic Antigen-Related Cellular Adhesion Molecule 6 (CEACAM6) as a Biomarker in Cholangiocarcinoma.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2016-03-14,"The aim of the present study is to determine if CEACAM6 can be detected in the bile of patients with biliary cancer and can serve as a diagnostic biomarker for cholangiocarcinoma. Distinguishing bile duct carcinoma from other diagnoses is often difficult using endoscopic or percutaneous techniques. The cell surface protein CEACAM6 is over-expressed in many gastrointestinal cancers and may be selectively elevated in biliary adenocarcinoma. Bile from patients with benign biliary disease and cholangiocarcinoma (hilar, intrahepatic and distal) was collected at the time of index operation. The concentration of CEACAM6 was quantified by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and correlated to pathologic diagnosis. Diagnostic capability of CEACAM6 was evaluated by Wilcoxon rank-sum, linear regression, multiple regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Bile from 83 patients was analyzed: 42 with benign disease and 41 with cholangiocarcinoma. Patients in the benign cohort were younger, predominantly female, and had lower median biliary CEACAM6 levels than patients in the malignant cohort (7.5 ng/ml vs. 40 ng/ml; p = <.001). ROC curve analysis determined CEACAM6 to be a positive predictor cholangiocarcinoma with a CEACAM6 level >14 ng/ml associated with 87.5% sensitivity, 69.1% specificity, and a likelihood ratio of 2.8 (AUC 0.74). Multiple regression analysis suggested elevated alkaline phosphatase and the presence of biliary endoprostheses may influence CEACAM6 levels.

Assessing the impact of common bile duct resection in the surgical management of gallbladder cancer.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2016-05-20,"Although radical re-resection for gallbladder cancer (GBC) has been advocated, the optimal extent of re-resection remains unknown. The current study aimed to assess the impact of common bile duct (CBD) resection on survival among patients undergoing surgery for GBC. Patients undergoing curative-intent surgery for GBC were identified using a multi-institutional cohort of patients. Multivariable Cox-proportional hazards regression was performed to identify risk factors for a poor overall survival (OS). Among the 449 patients identified, 26.9% underwent a concomitant CBD resection. The median number of lymph nodes harvested did not differ based on CBD resection (CBD, 4 [IQR: 2-9] vs. no CBD, 3 [IQR: 1-7], P = 0.108). While patients who underwent a CBD resection had a worse OS, after adjusting for potential confounders, CBD resection did not impact OS (HR = 1.40, 95%CI 0.87-2.27, P = 0.170). Rather, the presence of advanced disease (T3: HR = 3.11, 95%CI 1.22-7.96, P = 0.018; T4: HR = 7.24, 95%CI 1.70-30.85, P = 0.007) and the presence of disease at the surgical margin (HR = 2.58, 95%CI 1.26-5.31, P = 0.010) were predictive of a worse OS.

Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Mutations Confer Dasatinib Hypersensitivity and SRC Dependence in Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma.,Cancer discovery,Cancer Discov,2016-05-26,"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is an aggressive liver bile duct malignancy exhibiting frequent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1/IDH2) mutations. Through a high-throughput drug screen of a large panel of cancer cell lines, including 17 biliary tract cancers, we found that IDH mutant (IDHm) ICC cells demonstrate a striking response to the multikinase inhibitor dasatinib, with the highest sensitivity among 682 solid tumor cell lines. Using unbiased proteomics to capture the activated kinome and CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing to introduce dasatinib-resistant ""gatekeeper"" mutant kinases, we identified SRC as a critical dasatinib target in IDHm ICC. Importantly, dasatinib-treated IDHm xenografts exhibited pronounced apoptosis and tumor regression. Our results show that IDHm ICC cells have a unique dependency on SRC and suggest that dasatinib may have therapeutic benefit against IDHm ICC. Moreover, these proteomic and genome-editing strategies provide a systematic and broadly applicable approach to define targets of kinase inhibitors underlying drug responsiveness.

We present a video demonstrating a laparoscopic spleen-preserving total pancreatectomy in a patient with M-IPMN. A healthy 66-year-old male was diagnosed with recurrent pancreatitis. A computed tomography of the abdomen demonstrated a diffusely dilated pancreatic duct (10 mm) and a 5 mm mural nodule in the neck of the pancreas. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography demonstrated a 'fish mouth' appearance at the major papilla, with a villous mass (15 mm) in the pancreatic head. Biopsy was consistent with M-IPMN, and tumor markers were normal. A spleen-preserving laparoscopic total pancreatectomy was performed over a period of 270 min, with 150 cc of blood loss without complications.

Biliary carcinomas: pathology and the role of DNA mismatch repair deficiency.,Chinese clinical oncology,Chin Clin Oncol,2016-10-01,"The pathology of biliary carcinomas is diverse with different gross and histological features in tumors arising in the different segments of the biliary system. Various epidemiological risk factors, varied genetic makeup, and tissue microenvironment are contributory factors. As biliary tumors have been shown to be a part of the Lynch syndrome tumor spectrum, it is plausible to speculate that DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency plays a role in biliary tumors. Literature data suggest that DNA MMR deficiency indeed occurs in these tumors, albeit infrequently with the reported frequencies (weighted for sample size) of high level microsatellite instability (MSI) being 5% each for gallbladder carcinoma and carcinoma of extra-hepatic bile ducts, and 10% each for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and ampullary carcinoma. Importantly, the presence of MMR deficiency in these tumors has been shown to have different implications with regard to its association with Lynch syndrome, tumor histological features, and other clinical characteristics, when compared with non-biliary tumors or among the biliary tumors from the different segments of the biliary system.

Outcomes After Radio(chemo)therapy for Non-Metastatic Bile Duct Cancer.,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",In Vivo,2017-01-01,"The role of radio(chemo) therapy for non-metastatic bile duct cancer is not well defined. This study provides additional data for this rare situation. Data of eight patients receiving radio(chemo)therapy for non-metastatic bile duct cancer were retrospectively analyzed regarding local control, metastases-free survival and overall survival. In addition to the entire cohort, five tumor- or treatment-related factors were investigated: tumor stage, histologic grading, point in time of radio(chemo)therapy, upfront surgery and concurrent chemotherapy. Median overall survival was 37 months. Overall survival rates at 3 and 5 years were 56% and 38%, respectively. Lower histologic grading was significantly associated with better overall survival (p=0.042).

The role of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 in bile-acid-induced cholangiocyte proliferation and cholestasis-induced liver injury in mice.,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",Hepatology,2017-04-28,"Bile duct obstruction is a potent stimulus for cholangiocyte proliferation, especially for large cholangiocytes. Our previous studies reported that conjugated bile acids (CBAs) activate the protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathways through sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) 2 in hepatocytes and cholangiocarcinoma cells. It also has been reported that taurocholate (TCA) promotes large cholangiocyte proliferation and protects cholangiocytes from bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced apoptosis. However, the role of S1PR2 in bile-acid-mediated cholangiocyte proliferation and cholestatic liver injury has not been elucidated. Here, we report that S1PR2 is the predominant S1PR expressed in cholangiocytes. Both TCA- and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-induced activation of ERK1/2 and AKT were inhibited by JTE-013, a specific antagonist of S1PR2, in cholangiocytes. In addition, TCA- and S1P-induced cell proliferation and migration were inhibited by JTE-013 and a specific short hairpin RNA of S1PR2, as well as chemical inhibitors of ERK1/2 and AKT in mouse cholangiocytes. In BDL mice, expression of S1PR2 was up-regulated in whole liver and cholangiocytes. S1PR2 deficiency significantly reduced BDL-induced cholangiocyte proliferation and cholestatic injury, as indicated by significant reductions in inflammation and liver fibrosis in S1PR2 knockout mice. Treatment of BDL mice with JTE-013 significantly reduced total bile acid levels in serum and cholestatic liver injury. This study suggests that CBA-induced activation of S1PR2-mediated signaling pathways plays a critical role in obstructive cholestasis and may represent a novel therapeutic target for cholestatic liver diseases.

Integrative Genomic Analysis of Cholangiocarcinoma Identifies Distinct IDH-Mutant Molecular Profiles.,Cell reports,Cell Rep,2017-03-01,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive malignancy of the bile ducts, with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Here, we describe the integrated analysis of somatic mutations, RNA expression, copy number, and DNA methylation by The Cancer Genome Atlas of a set of predominantly intrahepatic CCA cases and propose a molecular classification scheme. We identified an IDH mutant-enriched subtype with distinct molecular features including low expression of chromatin modifiers, elevated expression of mitochondrial genes, and increased mitochondrial DNA copy number.

Transarterial chemoembolization combined with computed tomography-guided 125iodine implantation enhances survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients with portal vein tumor thrombus.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2017-04-01,"We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with computed tomography-guided 125iodine implantation (TACE-125iodine) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with type B portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). From medical records, we determined that 50 patients who received 125iodine implantation 4-7 days after the first TACE session showed better survival than 50 patients who received only TACE (median survival, 13.1 vs. 6.0 months; P<0.01). Moreover, the PVTT control rate was higher in the TACE-125iodine than TACE alone group (78% vs. 18%; P<0.01). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the TACE-125iodine procedure was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. We also observed that bilirubin levels were increased at 4 weeks, indicating that 125iodine seeding in the PVTT beneficially impacted the small bile duct, which is proximal to the portal vein. No severe adverse events were observed in patients that received 125iodine seed implantation, and the mild adverse events were successfully treated. This study shows that TACE-125iodine therapy enhances patient survival with minimal adverse events.

Clinical applications,Proteomics Clin Appl,2017-07-10,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a malignancy of the bile ducts. The purpose of this discovery study was to identify effective serum markers for surveillance of cholangiocarcinoma. Using a glycomic method, patients with CCA were determined to have increased levels of alpha-1,3 and alpha-1,6 linked fucosylated glycan. Proteomic analysis of the serum fucosylated proteome identified proteins such as alpha-2-macroglobulin, kininogen, hemopexin, fetuin-A, alpha-1 anti-trypsin, and ceruloplasmin as being hyperfucosylated in HCC. The levels of these glycoproteins in 109 patients with CCA, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and control patients were compared to the performance of CA-19-9, the current ""gold standard"" assay for cholangiocarcinoma. Fucosylated Fetuin-A (fc-Fetuin-A) had the best ability to differentiate CCA from PSC, with an AUROC of 0.812 or 0.8665 at differentiating CCA from those with PSC or other liver disease. CA-19-9 had poor ability to differentiate PSC from cholangiocarcinoma (AUROC of 0.625).

"Redefining the Positive Margin in Pancreatic Cancer: Impact on Patterns of Failure, Long-Term Survival and Adjuvant Therapy.",Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2017-09-05,"There is debate regarding the definition and clinical significance of margin clearance in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). A comprehensive archival analysis of surgical resection margins was performed to determine the effect on locoregional recurrence and survival, and the impact of adjuvant therapy in PDA. We identified 105 patients with resected PDA. Pancreatic, anterior, bile duct, and posterior surgical resection margins (PM; posterior surface, uncinate and vascular groove) were identified. Three pathologists reviewed all archival surgical specimens and recategorized each margin as tumor at ink/transected, <0.5, 0.5-1, >1-2, or >2 mm from the inked surface. The impact of these and other clinical variables was assessed on local control, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Among all margins, PM clearance up to 2 mm was prognostic of DFS (p = 0.01) and OS (p = 0.01). Dichotomizing the PM at 2 mm revealed it to be an independent predictor of local recurrence-free survival [hazard ratio HR] 0.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.048-0.881, p = 0.033), DFS (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22-0.96, p = 0.03), and OS (HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.14-0.74, p = 0.008). A margin status of >2 mm was also prognostic of OS in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11-0.89, p = 0.03), however this difference was mitigated in patients receiving adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.10-1.58, p = 0.19).

"In Vivo PET Assay of Tumor Glutamine Flux and Metabolism: In-Human Trial of <sup>18</sup>F-(2S,4R)-4-Fluoroglutamine.",Radiology,Radiology,2018-01-31,"Purpose To assess the clinical safety, pharmacokinetics, and tumor imaging characteristics of fluorine 18-(2S,4R)-4-fluoroglutamine (FGln), a glutamine analog radiologic imaging agent. Materials and Methods This study was approved by the institutional review board and conducted under a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved Investigational New Drug application in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. All patients provided written informed consent. Between January 2013 and October 2016, 25 adult patients with cancer received an intravenous bolus of FGln tracer (mean, 244 MBq ± 118, <100 μg) followed by positron emission tomography (PET) and blood radioassays. Patient data were summarized with descriptive statistics. FGln biodistribution and plasma amino acid levels in nonfasting patients (n = 13) were compared with those from patients who fasted at least 8 hours before injection (n = 12) by using nonparametric one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction. Tumor FGln avidity versus fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity in patients with paired PET scans (n = 15) was evaluated with the Fisher exact test. P < .05 was considered indicative of a statistically significant difference. Results FGln PET depicted tumors of different cancer types (breast, pancreas, renal, neuroendocrine, lung, colon, lymphoma, bile duct, or glioma) in 17 of the 25 patients, predominantly clinically aggressive tumors with genetic mutations implicated in abnormal glutamine metabolism. Acute fasting had no significant effect on FGln biodistribution and plasma amino acid levels. FGln-avid tumors were uniformly FDG-avid but not vice versa (P = .07). Patients experienced no adverse effects. Conclusion Preliminary human FGln PET trial results provide clinical validation of abnormal glutamine metabolism as a potential tumor biomarker for targeted radiotracer imaging in several different cancer types. <sup>©</sup> RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

The Impact of Intraoperative Re-Resection of a Positive Bile Duct Margin on Clinical Outcomes for Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2018-02-22,"The impact of re-resection of a positive intraoperative bile duct margin on clinical outcomes for resectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCCA) remains controversial. We sought to define the impact of re-resection of an initially positive frozen-section bile duct margin on outcomes of patients undergoing surgery for HCCA. Patients who underwent curative-intent resection for HCCA between 2000 and 2014 were identified at 10 hepatobiliary centers. Short- and long-term outcomes were analyzed among patients stratified by margin status. Among 215 (83.7%) patients who underwent frozen-section evaluation of the bile duct, 80 (37.2%) patients had a positive (R1) ductal margin, 58 (72.5%) underwent re-resection, and 29 ultimately had a secondary negative margin (secondary R0). There was no difference in morbidity, 30-day mortality, and length of stay among patients who had primary R0, secondary R0, and R1 resection (all p > 0.10). Median and 5-year survival were 22.3 months and 23.3%, respectively, among patients who had a primary R0 resection compared with 18.5 months and 7.9%, respectively, for patients with an R1 resection (p = 0.08).

Preoperative Risk Score to Predict Occult Metastatic or Locally Advanced Disease in Patients with Resectable Perihilar Cholangiocarcinoma on Imaging.,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,J. Am. Coll. Surg.,2018-04-06,"Many patients with resectable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (PHC) on imaging are diagnosed intraoperatively with occult metastatic or locally advanced disease, precluding a curative-intent resection. This study aimed to develop and validate a preoperative risk score. Patients with resectable PHC on imaging who underwent operations in 2 high-volume centers (US and Europe) between 2000 and 2015 were included. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to develop the risk score. Cross-validation was used to validate the score, alternating the 2 centers as ""training"" and ""testing"" datasets. Of 566 patients who underwent operations, 309 (55%) patients had a resection, and in 257 (45%) patients, a curative-intent resection was precluded due to distant metastasis (n = 151 [27%]) or locally advanced disease (n = 106 [19%]). Preoperative predictors included bilirubin >2 mg/dL, bile duct involvement on imaging, portal vein involvement on imaging (≥180 degrees), hepatic artery involvement on imaging (≥180 degrees), and suspicious lymph nodes on imaging. The new risk score (c-index 0.75 after cross-validation) provided significantly more accurate predictions than the Bismuth classification (c-index 0.62), Blumgart T-staging (c-index 0.67), and cTNM staging (c-index 0.68). The new risk score identified 4 risk groups for occult metastatic or locally advanced disease: low (14.7%), intermediate (29.5%), high (47.3%), and very high risk (81.3%). The preoperative score groups also predicted survival after operation, irrespective of intraoperative findings (p < 0.001). The validated risk score can predict occult distant metastatic or locally advanced PHC based on 5 preoperatively available factors. The score can be useful in preoperative shared decision making and selection of patients in neoadjuvant clinical trials.",Journal Article,655.0,2.0,Many patients with resectable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma PHC on imaging are diagnosed intraoperatively with occult metastatic or locally advanced disease precluding a curative-intent resection This study aimed to develop and validate a preoperative risk score Patients with resectable PHC on imaging who underwent operations in 2 high-volume centers US and Europe between 2000 and 2015 were included Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to develop the risk score Cross-validation was used to validate the score alternating the 2 centers as `` training '' and `` testing '' datasets Of 566 patients who underwent operations 309 55 patients had a resection and in 257 45 patients a curative-intent resection was precluded due to distant metastasis n 151 27 or locally advanced disease n 106 19 Preoperative predictors included bilirubin 2 mg/dL duct involvement on imaging portal vein involvement on imaging ≥180 degrees hepatic artery involvement on imaging ≥180 degrees and suspicious lymph nodes on imaging The new risk score c-index 0.75 after cross-validation provided significantly more accurate predictions than the Bismuth classification c-index 0.62 Blumgart T-staging c-index 0.67 and cTNM staging c-index 0.68 The new risk score identified 4 risk groups for occult metastatic or locally advanced disease low 14.7 intermediate 29.5 high 47.3 and very high risk 81.3 The preoperative score groups also predicted survival after operation irrespective of intraoperative findings p 0.001 The validated risk score can predict occult distant metastatic or locally advanced PHC based on 5 preoperatively available factors The score can be useful in preoperative shared decision making and selection of patients in neoadjuvant clinical trials,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[445, 7, 5, 1899, 9124, 2126, 9615, 23, 270, 32, 265, 6595, 5, 2879, 113, 15, 795, 131, 34, 13551, 8, 1075, 1697, 170, 26, 45, 1295, 6, 690, 2, 2183, 8, 498, 43, 368, 7, 5, 1899, 9615, 23, 270, 54, 208, 3867, 4, 18, 64, 433, 1168, 843, 2, 3934, 59, 1081, 2, 1483, 11, 159, 658, 812, 320, 65, 10, 95, 6, 690, 3, 43, 368, 1383, 929, 10, 95, 6, 2183, 3, 368, 5181, 3, 18, 1168, 22, 1741, 522, 2, 471, 522, 3455, 1, 14539, 7, 54, 208, 3867, 9440, 614, 7, 42, 8, 170, 2, 4, 7941, 512, 7, 8, 1075, 1697, 170, 10, 8035, 520, 6, 626, 278, 78, 5075, 428, 15, 795, 131, 34, 78, 3251, 326, 498, 674, 159, 5009, 18, 81, 1826, 2920, 799, 23, 270, 3307, 2762, 799, 23, 270, 31719, 4133, 939, 2872, 799, 23, 270, 31719, 4133, 2, 3230, 263, 502, 23, 270, 3, 217, 43, 368, 256, 558, 13, 481, 50, 1383, 929, 1052, 97, 80, 1481, 4340, 76, 3, 22291, 947, 256, 558, 13, 744, 26876, 102, 632, 256, 558, 13, 598, 2, 37895, 632, 256, 558, 13, 806, 3, 217, 43, 368, 108, 39, 43, 271, 9, 2879, 113, 15, 795, 131, 34, 154, 213, 67, 919, 462, 33, 64, 662, 27, 2, 923, 64, 43, 865, 27, 3, 498, 368, 271, 120, 783, 25, 50, 2589, 3500, 1, 1720, 272, 19, 13, 144, 3, 938, 43, 368, 122, 678, 2879, 626, 113, 15, 795, 131, 9615, 90, 23, 33, 3888, 390, 130, 3, 368, 122, 40, 999, 4, 498, 2664, 948, 1079, 2, 881, 1, 7, 4, 536, 38, 143]",1759.0,29627334,70
Technique for the administration of high-dose-rate brachytherapy to the bile duct using a nasobiliary catheter.,Brachytherapy,Brachytherapy,,"Cholangiocarcinoma patients who are potential candidates for liver transplantation may be treated with high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy using a minimally invasive nasobiliary catheter in an effort to escalate the radiotherapy dose to the tumor and maximize local control rates. This work describes the equipment, procedures, and quality assurance (QA) that enables successful administration. This work describes the nasobiliary catheter placement, simulation, treatment planning, treatment delivery, and QA. In addition, a chart review was performed of all patients who received endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for HDR bile duct brachytherapy at our institution from 2007 to 2017. The review evaluated how many patients were treated and the number of patients who could not be treated because of anatomic and/or equipment limitations. From 2007 to 2017, 122 cholangiocarcinoma patients have been treated with HDR brachytherapy using a nasobiliary catheter. Three patients underwent catheter placement but did not receive brachytherapy treatment due to catheter migration between placement and treatment or because the HDR afterloader was unable to extend the source wire into the treatment site. Periodic QA is recommended for ensuring whether the HDR afterloader is capable of extending the source wire through an extensive and curved path.

"Ramucirumab Plus Pembrolizumab in Patients with Previously Treated Advanced or Metastatic Biliary Tract Cancer: Nonrandomized, Open-Label, Phase I Trial (JVDF).",The oncologist,Oncologist,2018-05-31,"Ramucirumab plus pembrolizumab revealed no unexpected safety findings in patients with advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer, which is consistent with reports of other tumor cohorts within this phase Ia/b trial.Ramucirumab plus pembrolizumab did not demonstrate an improvement in overall survival when compared with historical controls in biomarker unselected, heavily pretreated patients with advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer.Patients with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive tumors had improved overall survival compared with patients with PD-L1-negative disease. Few treatment options exist for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC) following progression on gemcitabine-cisplatin. Preclinical evidence suggests that simultaneous blockade of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) and programmed death 1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) enhances antitumor effects. We assessed the safety and efficacy of ramucirumab, an IgG1 VEGFR-2 antagonist, with pembrolizumab, an IgG4 PD-1 antagonist, in biomarker-unselected patients with previously treated advanced or metastatic BTC. Patients had previously treated advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder, intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts, or ampulla of Vater. Ramucirumab 8 mg/kg was administered intravenously on days 1 and 8 with intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg on day 1 every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability of the combination. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Twenty-six patients were treated at 12 centers in five countries. Hypertension was the most common grade 3 treatment-related adverse event (TRAE), occurring in five patients.

Challenges of surgical management of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.,Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,Expert Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol,2018-06-27,"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is a rare malignancy arising from biliary tract epithelium within bile ducts proximal to the secondary biliary radicles. The majority of patients are diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic disease at presentation. Surgical resection remains the only potentially curative option, but poses unique challenges due to the large size and aggressive behavior of these tumors. Areas covered: The goal of surgical management of iCCA is margin negative (R0) hepatic resection with preservation of adequate size liver remnant and function. Data regarding role of staging laparoscopy, margin status, portal lymphadenectomy, and vascular resection for iCCA are reviewed. Perioperative systemic therapy may have value, although prospective data have been lacking. Recurrence rates remain high even after R0 resection; among patients with recurrent disease limited to the liver, re-resection or locoregional therapies may play a role. Liver transplantation may be an option for select patients with very early-stage iCCA, although this should be done on a protocol-only basis. Expert commentary: Appropriate preoperative patient selection and surgical technique are paramount to ensure optimal oncologic outcomes for patients with resectable iCCA.

Actual 5-Year Survivors After Surgical Resection of Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2018-12-11,"The prevalence and characteristics of actual 5-year survivors after surgical treatment of hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HC) have not been described previously. Patients who underwent resection for HC from 2000 to 2015 were analyzed through a multi-institutional registry from 10 U.S. academic medical centers. The clinicopathologic characteristics and both the perioperative and long-term outcomes for actual 5-year survivors were compared with those for non-survivors (patients who died within 5 years after surgery). Patients alive at last encounter who had a follow-up period shorter than 5 years were excluded from the study. The study identified 257 patients with HC who underwent curative-intent resection with an actuarial 5-year survival of 19%. Of 194 patients with a follow-up period longer than 5 years, 23 (12%) were 5-year survivors. Compared with non-survivors, the 5-year survivors had a lower median pretreatment CA 19-9 level (116 vs. 34 U/L; P = 0.008) and a lower rate of lymph node involvement (42% vs. 15%; P = 0.027) and R1 margins (39% vs. 17%; P = 0.042). However, the sole presence of these factors did not preclude a 5-year survival after surgery. The frequencies of bile duct resection alone, major hepatectomy, caudate lobe resection, portal vein or hepatic artery resection, preoperative biliary sepsis, intraoperative blood transfusion, serious postoperative complications, and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy were comparable between the two groups.

Intraoperative Air Leak Test to Prevent Bile Leak After Right Posterior Sectionectomy with En Bloc Diaphragm Resection for Metastatic Teratoma.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2019-05-07,"The intraoperative air cholangiogram, or ""air leak test"" (ALT), at the time of hepatectomy can significantly reduce the rates of bile leak and symptomatic fluid collection after high-risk procedures.1<sup>,</sup>2 Because a bile leak in the setting of an en bloc diaphragm resection and mesh reconstruction would be a particularly dreaded complication, this video shows the technique for resection, reconstruction, and ALT. The video presents the case of a 29-year-old woman who had metastatic teratoma with an 8 × 7-cm liver metastasis in segment 7 and diaphragm invasion to the level of the right hepatic vein. The authors performed a formal right posterior sectionectomy with en bloc diaphragm resection. The 12 × 8-cm diaphragmatic defect was reconstructed using biologic mesh (Surgimend, Integra LifeSciences, Plainsboro, NJ). An intraoperative ALT (air injection into the cystic duct with finger compression of the distal bile duct) identified several areas of bubbles from biliary radicles on the cut surface of the liver, which were ligated with 4-0 polypropylene. The ALT was repeated until no bubbles remained. Because no evidence of bubbles was observed, no surgical drain was needed. The patient did well postoperatively with no complications. In cases of combined liver and diaphragmatic resection, prevention of bile leak, with subsequent contamination of the diaphragm repair and even the thoracic cavity, is particularly vital. An easily replicated intraoperative air leak test can mitigate the risk of bile leak and organ-space infection, as well as associated sequelae on quality of life, return to intended oncologic therapy, and oncologic outcomes.",Case Reports,259.0,0.0,The intraoperative air cholangiogram or `` air leak test '' ALT at the time of hepatectomy can significantly reduce the rates of leak and symptomatic fluid collection after high-risk procedures.1 sup /sup 2 Because a leak in the setting of an en bloc diaphragm resection and mesh reconstruction would be a particularly dreaded complication this video shows the technique for resection reconstruction and ALT The video presents the case of a 29-year-old woman who had metastatic teratoma with an 8 7-cm metastasis in segment 7 and diaphragm invasion to the level of the right hepatic vein The authors performed a formal right posterior sectionectomy with en bloc diaphragm resection The 12 8-cm diaphragmatic defect was reconstructed using biologic mesh Surgimend Integra LifeSciences Plainsboro NJ An intraoperative ALT air injection into the cystic duct with finger compression of the distal duct identified several areas of bubbles from biliary radicles on the cut surface of the which were ligated with 4-0 polypropylene The ALT was repeated until no bubbles remained Because no evidence of bubbles was observed no surgical drain was needed The patient did well postoperatively with no complications In cases of combined and diaphragmatic resection prevention of leak with subsequent contamination of the diaphragm repair and even the thoracic cavity is particularly vital An easily replicated intraoperative air leak test can mitigate the risk of leak and organ-space infection as well as associated sequelae on quality of life return to intended oncologic therapy and oncologic outcomes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1720, 6909, 28026, 15, 6909, 4238, 412, 522, 4548, 28, 3, 98, 1, 2711, 122, 97, 969, 3, 151, 1, 4238, 2, 1704, 2357, 2442, 50, 64, 43, 1369, 14, 172, 172, 18, 408, 8, 4238, 4, 3, 546, 1, 35, 4375, 5590, 7482, 170, 2, 11332, 1470, 688, 40, 8, 823, 23386, 1447, 26, 4139, 1949, 3, 1312, 9, 170, 1470, 2, 4548, 3, 4139, 2740, 3, 473, 1, 8, 462, 111, 1095, 2854, 54, 42, 113, 4845, 5, 35, 66, 67, 494, 278, 4, 4610, 67, 2, 7482, 578, 6, 3, 301, 1, 3, 1913, 939, 2762, 3, 738, 173, 8, 5057, 1913, 3028, 40823, 5, 4375, 5590, 7482, 170, 3, 133, 66, 494, 15311, 5398, 10, 7267, 75, 1283, 11332, 74769, 74770, 74771, 74772, 12754, 35, 1720, 4548, 6909, 1754, 237, 3, 2965, 2920, 5, 8079, 3481, 1, 3, 2107, 2920, 108, 392, 1361, 1, 27157, 29, 2532, 51123, 23, 3, 3554, 1255, 1, 3, 92, 11, 18971, 5, 39, 13, 38084, 3, 4548, 10, 2113, 1100, 77, 27157, 958, 408, 77, 241, 1, 27157, 10, 164, 77, 221, 9203, 10, 575, 3, 69, 205, 149, 3541, 5, 77, 521, 4, 140, 1, 397, 2, 15311, 170, 1070, 1, 4238, 5, 706, 9866, 1, 3, 7482, 972, 2, 871, 3, 2098, 2405, 16, 823, 3511, 35, 4697, 6714, 1720, 6909, 4238, 412, 122, 5626, 3, 43, 1, 4238, 2, 1259, 3865, 930, 22, 149, 22, 41, 4156, 23, 372, 1, 358, 4656, 6, 4081, 1998, 36, 2, 1998, 123]",1591.0,31065963,17
