Core biopsies can be used to distinguish differences in expression profiling by cDNA microarrays.,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,J Mol Diagn,2002-02-01,"The primary focus of this work was to determine the feasibility of obtaining representative expression array profiles from clinical core biopsies. For this purpose we performed six 16-gauge needle core biopsies and an excision biopsy on each of two different human xenografts, one from an Ewing's sarcoma cell line and the second from neuroblastoma cell line grown in Beige-Scid mice. Three of the six core biopsies were processed separately and the remaining three were pooled and processed together. As the initial RNA material isolated from the core biopsies was not sufficient for microarray analysis, an amplification procedure using a modified Eberwine protocol was performed, and the amplified products applied onto a 6000-feature human cDNA microarray. Comparisons of the array results from core biopsies (amplified RNA) and surgical specimens (non-amplified RNA) showed maintenance of the expression profile as assessed by hierarchical clustering. Gene expression profiles obtained from microarray analysis clearly differentiated the Ewing's sarcoma from the neuroblastoma with both core and excisional biopsies as starting material. Pooling the core biopsies did not improve the concordance with excisional biopsies. In conclusion, our results suggest that core biopsies can be used as a suitable and reliable material for the determination of tumor genetic profiles.",Comparative Study,6563.0,40.0,The primary focus of this work was to determine the feasibility of obtaining representative expression array profiles from clinical core biopsies For this purpose we performed six 16-gauge needle core biopsies and an excision biopsy on each of two different human xenografts one from an 's cell line and the second from cell line grown in Beige-Scid mice Three of the six core biopsies were processed separately and the remaining three were pooled and processed together As the initial RNA material isolated from the core biopsies was not sufficient for microarray analysis an amplification procedure using a modified Eberwine protocol was performed and the amplified products applied onto a 6000-feature human cDNA microarray Comparisons of the array results from core biopsies amplified RNA and surgical specimens non-amplified RNA showed maintenance of the expression profile as assessed by hierarchical clustering Gene expression profiles obtained from microarray analysis clearly differentiated the 's from the with both core and excisional biopsies as starting material Pooling the core biopsies did not improve the concordance with excisional biopsies In conclusion our results suggest that core biopsies can be used as a suitable and reliable material for the determination of tumor genetic profiles,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 86, 1222, 1, 26, 1357, 10, 6, 223, 3, 1437, 1, 5244, 3724, 55, 1926, 1241, 29, 38, 1793, 1154, 9, 26, 743, 21, 173, 437, 245, 10145, 2177, 1793, 1154, 2, 35, 1366, 411, 23, 296, 1, 100, 338, 171, 1348, 104, 29, 35, 292, 31, 328, 2, 3, 419, 29, 31, 328, 5473, 4, 16620, 4129, 399, 169, 1, 3, 437, 1793, 1154, 11, 5232, 3582, 2, 3, 1844, 169, 11, 1830, 2, 5232, 1162, 22, 3, 388, 893, 3692, 1355, 29, 3, 1793, 1154, 10, 44, 1952, 9, 1727, 65, 35, 1073, 1299, 75, 8, 1230, 42837, 1182, 10, 173, 2, 3, 2429, 2766, 1498, 3301, 8, 16187, 2705, 171, 4212, 1727, 2213, 1, 3, 1926, 99, 29, 1793, 1154, 2429, 893, 2, 221, 623, 220, 2429, 893, 224, 1146, 1, 3, 55, 800, 22, 275, 20, 4466, 3147, 145, 55, 1241, 683, 29, 1727, 65, 2536, 1442, 3, 292, 29, 3, 5, 110, 1793, 2, 6488, 1154, 22, 1723, 3692, 9419, 3, 1793, 1154, 205, 44, 401, 3, 1827, 5, 6488, 1154, 4, 1221, 114, 99, 309, 17, 1793, 1154, 122, 40, 95, 22, 8, 2884, 2, 2450, 3692, 9, 3, 3104, 1, 30, 336, 1241]",1307.0,11826185,0
Novel regions of allelic imbalance identified by genome-wide analysis of neuroblastoma.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2002-03-01,"Several nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities have been associated with neuroblastoma (NB). However, the relationship of each genetic event to the clinical course of disease is not firmly established. We have performed a genome-wide allelic scan of NB to identify regions with frequent allelic imbalance (AI) and correlate the allelotype with clinical features of disease. Nineteen tumors from patients across the spectrum of NB were used. Genome-wide allelotype was performed using 169 fluorescently labeled microsatellite markers from the Weber 9a human screening set (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) and 48 independent markers for high-density analysis of selected regions. Eleven chromosomal regions had AI in >25% of tumors including loci known previously to be frequently altered such as 1p36 (10 of 19; 52%), 2p (9 of 19; 47%), 17q (8 of 19; 42%), 11q23 (8 of 19; 42%), 14q32 (7 of 19; 37%), 19q (6 of 19; 31%), 7q (6 of 19; 31%), 9p21 (5 of 19; 26%), and three novel regions of frequent AI at 10p11-p15 (7 of 19; 40%), 12q24.1 (5 of 19; 26%), and 8qcen-q24 (5 of 19; 26%). AI of four regions (8q, 10p, 19q, and 12q) allowed the distinction of two genetic groups that matched clinical significant subgroups of NB. AI at 12q24 and 19q13 was found exclusively in high-risk local-regional tumors, whereas AI at 10p11 and 8q appeared to be specific for stage 4 tumors with MCYN amplification.

C-kit expression in pediatric solid tumors: a comparative immunohistochemical study.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2002-04-01,"The stem cell factor/c-kit tyrosine kinase receptor pathway has been shown to be important for tumor growth and progression in several cancers, including mast cell diseases, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, acute myeloid leukemia, small cell lung carcinoma, and Ewing sarcoma. Studies using the oral agent STI-571 (Gleevec, Novartis), an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases bcr-abl, c-kit, and PDGFR, have shown significant responses in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumor. With the aim of identifying additional groups of tumors that may use the stem cell factor/c-kit pathway and secondarily may be responsive to STI-571 treatment, this study surveyed 151 primary tumors from patients treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital for immunohistochemical expression of c-kit. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were stained with rabbit polyclonal anti-human c-kit (CD117, Dako) using standard avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique, antigen retrieval, and an automated stainer. Strong, diffuse staining for c-kit was seen in a proportion of synovial sarcomas, osteosarcomas, and Ewing sarcomas. Strong, diffuse staining was less common in neuroblastomas, Wilms' tumors, and rhabdomyosarcomas and was negative in alveolar soft part sarcomas and desmoplastic small round cell tumors.

Screening of infants and mortality due to neuroblastoma.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2002-04-01,"Neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial solid tumor that occurs in early childhood, can be identified in the preclinical stages by the detection of catecholamines in the urine. However, it is unknown whether routine screening for neuroblastoma reduces mortality due to this disease. Through their parents, we offered screening for neuroblastoma at three weeks and six months of age to all 476,654 children born in the province of Quebec, Canada, during a five-year period (May 1, 1989, through April 30, 1994). The participation rate was 92 percent. The rate of death due to neuroblastoma was determined and compared with the rates in several unscreened control populations born during the same period. Among children younger than eight years of age in the Quebec cohort, there were 22 deaths due to neuroblastoma; the cumulative (+/-SE) mortality rate due to neuroblastoma was 4.78+/-1.14 per 100,000 children over a period of nine years.

Cross-sectional survey of 635 consecutive survivors (approximately 5%) drawn from 12 156 participants 18 years or older participating in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (a multiinstitutional cohort of individuals diagnosed between January 1, 1970, and December 31,1986, at an age <21 years, who had survived 5 years from diagnosis). The survey assessed knowledge of their cancer diagnosis and associated therapies in a 3- to 5-minute telephone questionnaire. Responses were compared with medical record data for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value. Overall, 72% accurately reported their diagnosis with precision and 19% were accurate but not precise. Individuals with central nervous system (CNS) cancer (odds ratio, 5.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-9.9) and neuroblastoma (OR, 4.2; 95% CI, 1.8-9.6) were more likely not to know their cancer diagnosis.

After induction therapy and surgery, peripheral-blood stem cells were mobilized with three cycles of high-dose cyclophosphamide and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Patients then underwent triple-tandem cycles of high-dose therapy with peripheral-blood stem-cell rescue followed by radiation to the primary site. Twenty-two of the 26 patients successfully completed induction therapy and were eligible for the triple-tandem consolidation high-dose therapy. Sufficient numbers of peripheral-blood stem cells were collected in all but one patient. Seventeen patients were able to complete all three cycles of high-dose therapy and peripheral-blood stem-cell rescue, two patients completed two cycles, and three patients completed one cycle.

We tested if (1-->3),(1-->4)-beta-D-glucan (beta-glucan) can synergize with anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) 3F8 (mouse IgG3) in therapy of human neuroblastoma xenografts. Athymic nude mice with established neuroblastoma xenografts were treated with daily i.p. or p.o. beta-glucan, in the presence/absence of i.v. MoAb twice a week, for 22-29 days.

Quantitation of GD2 synthase mRNA by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction: utility in bone marrow purging of neuroblastoma by anti-GD2 antibody 3F8.,Cancer,Cancer,2002-06-01,"Antigen ganglioside GD2 is expressed abundantly on neuroblastoma (NB) cells. Anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) 3F8 kills NB cells by complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Its utility in bone marrow (BM) purging is evaluated by a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay to quantify the mRNA of GD2 synthase, the key enzyme in GD2 synthesis. From 1990 to 1993, 10 patients with relapsed/refractory Stage 4 NB participated in a pilot study. In these patients, MoAb 3F8 was used to purge tumor cells from harvested BM that had 5% or less tumor content by immunofluorescence (IF). Subsequently, 31 Stage 4 NB patients who underwent treatment on the N7 protocol (1994-1999) had their BM, which was in remission, purged by 3F8 before (131)I-3F8 myeloablative radioimmunotherapy. GD2-positive tumor cells before and after purging were quantified by real-time quantitative RT-PCR of GD2 synthase. GD2 positivity by IF was found before purging in six of eight patients in the pilot study. Five of six patients became negative postpurging. Of 31 patients on the N7 protocol, the more sensitive real-time quantitative RT-PCR detected GD2 synthase mRNA in the BM samples of 7 patients even though the prepurge BM samples were negative by histology and IF. Six of the seven BM samples became negative after 3F8 purging. Marker positivity before purging was statistically significant in predicting overall survival (P = 0.04), but not progression-free survival (P = 0.1).

Evolving significance of prognostic markers associated with treatment improvement in patients with stage 4 neuroblastoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2002-05-01,"With recent improvements in the treatment and outcome of patients with neuroblastoma (NB), the authors reassessed the prognostic importance of clinical and biologic markers in patients with Stage 4 NB who were treated at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). The authors analyzed 84 patients with Stage 4 NB who were treated on the N5, N6, or N7 protocols at MSKCC from 1987 to 1999. The impact on survival of clinical factors (age, serum ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] levels), histopathology (International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification [INPC]), and tumor biologic markers (MYCN; ploidy; loss of heterozygosity [LOH] at 1p36, 1p22, 11q23, 14q12-q32, 9p21, and 19q13; and gain at 17q) were analyzed in univariate and multivariate models. Forty-six of 84 patients were alive at the time of this report (55%), with a median follow-up of 41 months from the time of diagnosis. In the univariate analysis, there was no prognostic impact on survival by age, serum ferritin and LDH levels, MYCN, 1p36 LOH, 14q32 LOH, or 17q gain. LOH at 11q23 was associated significantly with superior progression free survival (P = 0.04) and survival (P = 0.04) in the univariate analysis. In the multivariate analysis, it was found that 11q23 status was the most significant variable associated with overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-0.99). LOH at 11q23 and LOH at 1p22 were highly correlated (P = 0.02). It was found that 11q23 status and INPC score were the most significant variables associated with progression free survival. Because patient survival improves with more effective therapy, traditional prognostic markers, such as age, MYCN amplification, and elevated serum LDH levels, have become less important for patients with Stage 4 NB.

In the current study, the authors analyzed this phenomenon in a large series of children with metastatic NB. The authors studied 38 patients who were diagnosed with NB in the first decade of life and had metastatic disease 5 years or more from diagnosis. The median age at diagnosis was 3 years 10 months. MYCN was amplified in 2 of 28 patients tested. Of 30 patients with classic Stage 4 NB, 9 had a late first recurrence of disease (4.3-13 years from diagnosis). Of eight patients who had atypical cases at diagnosis (one isolated mandibular lesion, two Stage 4-N, five non-Stage 4), six had a late first distant recurrence of disease (4 years 11 months-38 years 8 months). Nineteen patients were off therapy continuously for 3 years or more before disease recurred a first or second time. Myeloablative therapy was used to consolidate a first or second response in 27 patients. High-dose conventional therapy helped to achieve a second remission of disease in 9 of 20 patients assessable for response of first recurrence but achieved no major responses of second or third relapse in 10 of 11 patients. The combination of anti-G(D2) immunotherapy and/or cis-retinoic acid, targeted radiotherapy, and multiple cycles of chemotherapy with modest toxicity helped prolong survival. Twelve patients survive at 5 years 6 months+ to 19 years 4 months+ from diagnosis (median, 6 years 10 months+), including four with complete remission of disease; 10 received anti-G(D2) immunotherapy after recurrence.

Relation between Irofulven (MGI-114) systemic exposure and tumor response in human solid tumor xenografts.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2002-09-01,"Irofulven is a novel, small molecular weight semisynthetic compound, derived from a family of mushroom toxins known as illudins. This DNA alkylating agent has a chemical structure unlike any other chemotherapeutic agent in clinical use. The molecule is currently being studied in several Phase I, II, and III trials. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the antitumor activity of Irofulven in a panel of 20 pediatric solid tumor xenografts and to relate the Irofulven systemic exposure, defined as area under the concentration time curve, to the antitumor dose associated with tumor regression in the tumor models. Irofulven was administered i.v. daily for 5 days with courses repeated every 21 days for a total of three cycles. The minimum effective dose of Irofulven causing objective regression (> or =50% volume regression) of advanced tumors was determined for each of 19 of 20 independently derived tumor models (12 brain tumors, 4 neuroblastomas, and 4 rhabdomyosarcomas). At the maximum tolerated dose for three cycles of treatment (4.6 mg/kg/day) objective regressions were determined in 14 of 18 tumor lines (78%). However, the dose-response relationship was acute. At 2 mg/kg only 3 of 15 tumors tested demonstrated objective regressions, and in 3 additional tumors volume regressions were not achieved at a higher dose level (3 mg/kg), hence were not additionally tested. After administering the maximum tolerated dose (tolerated for one or two cycles of treatment) of Irofulven, 7 mg/kg, to mice bearing sensitive and resistant human tumors plasma concentration-time profiles were determined.

Disialoganglioside GD2 and a novel tumor antigen: potential targets for immunotherapy of desmoplastic small round cell tumor.,Medical and pediatric oncology,Med. Pediatr. Oncol.,2002-12-01,"Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is an aggressive and often misdiagnosed neoplasm of children and young adults. It is chemotherapy-sensitive, yet patients often relapse off therapy because of residual microscopic disease at distant sites: peritoneum, liver, lymph node, and lung. Strategies directed at minimal residual disease (MRD) may be necessary for cure. Monoclonal antibodies selective for cell surface tumor-associated antigens may have utility for diagnosis and therapy of MRD, as recently demonstrated in advanced-stage neuroblastoma (JCO 16: 3053, 1998). We examined DSRCT samples for the expression of two tumor antigens that could serve as possible targets for antibody-based immunotherapeutic approaches. Using immunohistochemistry, we studied the expression of two antigens: (1) G(D2) using antibody 3F8 and (2) a novel antigen using antibody 8H9 in a panel of 46 freshly frozen DSRCT. G(D2) is a disialoganglioside, which is widely expressed among neuroectodermal tumors as well as adult sarcomas. 8H9 recognizes a 58 kDa surface antigen expressed among neuroectodermal, mesenchymal, and epithelial tumors with restricted expression on normal tissues. Thirty-two of 46 (70%) tumors were reactive with 3F8, and 44 of 46 (96%) with 8H9. Both G(D2) and the 58 kDa antigen were localized to tumor cell membrane and stroma. In general, immunoreactivity was stronger and more homogeneous with 8H9 than with 3F8. There was no correlation between expression of either antigen or clinical outcome. G(D2) and the novel tumor antigen recognized by 8H9 are potential targets for immunodiagnosis and antibody-based therapy of DSRCT.

Orally administered beta-glucans enhance anti-tumor effects of monoclonal antibodies.,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",Cancer Immunol. Immunother.,2002-09-20,"beta-Glucan primes leukocyte CR3 for enhanced cytotoxicity and synergizes with anti-tumor monoclonal antibodies (mAb). We studied readily available (1-->3)-beta- D-glucan using the immune deficient xenograft tumor models, and examined the relationship of its anti-tumor effect and physico-chemical properties. Established subcutaneous (s.c.) human xenografts were treated for 29 days orally with daily beta-glucan by intragastric injection and mAb intravenously (i.v.) twice weekly. Control mice received either mAb alone or beta-glucan alone. Tumor sizes were monitored over time. beta-Glucans were studied by carbohydrate linkage analysis, and high performance size-exclusion chromatography with multiple angle laser scattering detection. Orally administered beta- D-glucan greatly enhanced the anti-tumor effects of mAb against established tumors in mice. We observed this beta-glucan effect irrespective of antigen (GD2, GD3, CD20, epidermal growth factor-receptor, HER-2), human tumor type (neuroblastoma, melanoma, lymphoma, epidermoid carcinoma and breast carcinoma) or tumor sites (s.c. versus systemic).

The importance of tumor glucuronidase in the activation of irinotecan in a mouse xenograft model.,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.,2002-11-01,"The anticancer drug irinotecan (CPT-11) is activated to the potent topoisomerase I inhibitor, SN-38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin), by esterases. SN-38 is in turn conjugated to the inactive SN-38 glucuronide (SN-38G). The reverse reaction is mediated by beta-glucuronidases. Hence, production of SN-38 may occur through either pathway. In this study we conducted in vitro studies to examine these two reactions in neuroblastoma xenograft tumors (NB1691) and compared the rates of SN-38 production with those observed in the liver and plasma of the host SCID (severe-combined immunodeficient) mice. The rate of formation of SN-38 from CPT-11 by esterases slowed considerably during a 60-min incubation, consistent with the known deacylation-limited nature of this reaction. For xenograft tumor tissue, K(m) and V(max) values of 1.6 microM and 4.4 pmol/min/mg of protein, respectively, were observed. By comparison, these parameters were estimated to be 6.9 microM and 9.4 pmol/min/mg for mouse liver and 2.1 microM and 40.0 pmol/min/mg for mouse plasma, respectively. The formation of SN-38 from SN-38G was very pronounced in both liver and xenograft tumor tissue, in which it was nonsaturable (0.125-50 microM) and time-independent (0-60 min). The derived values of V(max)/K(m) were 0.65 microl/min/mg for the tumor and 2.12 microl/min/mg for the liver preparations. Microdialysate experiments revealed the concentrations of SN-38G and CPT-11 in tumor to be comparable. At equal substrate concentrations, production of SN-38 from SN-38G in tumor extracts was comparable with that from CPT-11. Therefore, reactivation of SN-38 in the tumor by beta-glucuronidases may represent an important route of tumor drug activation for CPT-11.",Journal Article,6290.0,12.0,The anticancer drug irinotecan CPT-11 is activated to the potent topoisomerase I inhibitor SN-38 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin by esterases SN-38 is in turn conjugated to the inactive SN-38 glucuronide SN-38G The reverse reaction is mediated by beta-glucuronidases Hence production of SN-38 may occur through either pathway In this study we conducted in vitro studies to examine these two reactions in xenograft tumors NB1691 and compared the rates of SN-38 production with those observed in the and plasma of the host SCID severe-combined immunodeficient mice The rate of formation of SN-38 from CPT-11 by esterases slowed considerably during a 60-min incubation consistent with the known deacylation-limited nature of this reaction For xenograft tumor tissue K m and V max values of 1.6 microM and 4.4 pmol/min/mg of protein respectively were observed By comparison these parameters were estimated to be 6.9 microM and 9.4 pmol/min/mg for mouse and 2.1 microM and 40.0 pmol/min/mg for mouse plasma respectively The formation of SN-38 from SN-38G was very pronounced in both and xenograft tumor tissue in which it was nonsaturable 0.125-50 microM and time-independent 0-60 min The derived values of V max /K m were 0.65 microl/min/mg for the tumor and 2.12 microl/min/mg for the preparations Microdialysate experiments revealed the concentrations of SN-38G and CPT-11 in tumor to be comparable At equal substrate concentrations production of SN-38 from SN-38G in tumor extracts was comparable with that from CPT-11 Therefore reactivation of SN-38 in the tumor by beta-glucuronidases may represent an important route of tumor drug activation for CPT-11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1475, 234, 1071, 3361, 175, 16, 735, 6, 3, 1157, 3999, 70, 230, 3133, 519, 67, 10559, 79, 20234, 20, 43054, 3133, 519, 16, 4, 3854, 3868, 6, 3, 5002, 3133, 519, 11435, 3133, 16259, 3, 1772, 1329, 16, 517, 20, 1090, 43055, 3665, 1529, 1, 3133, 519, 68, 1271, 298, 361, 308, 4, 26, 45, 21, 426, 4, 439, 94, 6, 1004, 46, 100, 2428, 4, 1330, 57, 23160, 2, 72, 3, 151, 1, 3133, 519, 1529, 5, 135, 164, 4, 3, 2, 554, 1, 3, 1204, 4129, 905, 397, 5031, 399, 3, 116, 1, 1264, 1, 3133, 519, 29, 3361, 175, 20, 43054, 10673, 5597, 190, 8, 335, 1538, 7797, 925, 5, 3, 440, 53166, 383, 2202, 1, 26, 1329, 9, 1330, 30, 246, 1634, 188, 2, 603, 2649, 1030, 1, 14, 49, 3550, 2, 39, 39, 9835, 1538, 81, 1, 178, 106, 11, 164, 20, 1155, 46, 1038, 11, 661, 6, 40, 49, 83, 3550, 2, 83, 39, 9835, 1538, 81, 9, 830, 2, 18, 14, 3550, 2, 327, 13, 9835, 1538, 81, 9, 830, 554, 106, 3, 1264, 1, 3133, 519, 29, 3133, 16259, 10, 923, 3517, 4, 110, 2, 1330, 30, 246, 4, 92, 192, 10, 33310, 13, 1731, 212, 3550, 2, 98, 306, 13, 335, 1538, 3, 526, 1030, 1, 603, 2649, 1634, 188, 11, 13, 556, 5128, 1538, 81, 9, 3, 30, 2, 18, 133, 5128, 1538, 81, 9, 3, 7791, 53167, 2332, 553, 3, 1003, 1, 3133, 16259, 2, 3361, 175, 4, 30, 6, 40, 1279, 28, 2997, 4235, 1003, 1529, 1, 3133, 519, 29, 3133, 16259, 4, 30, 8162, 10, 1279, 5, 17, 29, 3361, 175, 673, 3834, 1, 3133, 519, 4, 3, 30, 20, 1090, 43055, 68, 1231, 35, 305, 5841, 1, 30, 234, 363, 9, 3361, 175]",1653.0,12388647,1
Evidence for a hereditary neuroblastoma predisposition locus at chromosome 16p12-13.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2002-11-01,"Hereditary predisposition to develop neuroblastoma (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man 256700), a pediatric cancer of the sympathetic nervous system, segregates as an autosomal dominant Mendelian trait. We performed linkage analysis on seven families with two or more first-degree relatives affected with neuroblastoma to localize a hereditary neuroblastoma predisposition gene. A single interval at chromosome bands 16p12-13 was the only genomic region consistent with linkage (LOD(MAX) = 3.30 at D16S764). Identification of informative recombination events in linked families defined a 28.0-cM region between D16S748 and D16S769 that cosegregated with the disease in each pedigree. Loss of heterozygosity was identified in 5 of 11 familial neuroblastomas and 68 of 336 nonfamilial neuroblastomas (20.2%) at multiple 16p polymorphic loci. A 14.5-cM smallest region of overlap of somatic deletions was identified within the interval defined by linkage analysis (tel-D16S500-D16S412-cen).

Utilization of special education services and educational attainment among long-term survivors of childhood cancer: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,Cancer,Cancer,2003-02-01,"The objective of the current report was to compare the self-reported rates of special education (SE) and educational attainment among specific groups of childhood cancer survivors and a random sample of sibling controls. The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study is a retrospective cohort of individuals who were diagnosed with a cancer in childhood and survived at least 5 years postdiagnosis. This analysis includes 12,430 survivors and 3410 full siblings. Reported use of SE services and educational attainment were analyzed within subgroups defined by type of cancer, age at diagnosis, and type of treatment. The use of SE services was reported in 23% of survivors and 8% of siblings, with the greatest differences observed among survivors who were diagnosed before age 6 years, most notably survivors of central nervous system (CNS) tumors (odds ratio [OR], 18.8; 95% confidence interval [95%CI], 15.01-23.49), leukemia (OR, 4.4; 95%CI, 3.75-5.16), and Hodgkin disease (OR, 4.4; 95%CI, 2.64-7.24). It was found that intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX) and cranial radiation (CRT), administered alone or in combination, significantly increased the likelihood that a survivor would use SE (IT MTX only: OR, 1.3; 95%CI, 1.09-1.78; CRT only: OR, 7.2; 95%CI, 6.14-8.39; IT MTX and CRT combined: OR, 2.6; 95%CI, 2.30-2.95).

Autoantigen diversity in the opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome.,Annals of neurology,Ann. Neurol.,2003-03-01,"Despite circumstantial evidence that opsoclonus-myoclonus (OM) is often immune mediated, no specific autoantigen has been identified. Using sera of 21 patients with several types of OM (idiopathic, associated to small cell lung cancer, and associated to neuroblastoma), we probed a brainstem cDNA library to isolate target neuronal antigens. Thirty-seven clones coding for 25 proteins were isolated, with two groups of autoantigens emerging: (1) proteins of the postsynaptic density, among them the adenomatous polyposis coli, and 2) proteins with expression or function restricted to neurons, including RNA or DNA-binding proteins and zinc-finger proteins. Usually, each patient's serum recognized a different autoantigen, except for adenomatous polyposis coli that was recognized by sera of two patients with idiopathic OM and two control patients with nystagmus, diplopia, and paraneoplastic brainstem dysfunction. Overall, in the indicated types of OM, (1) we found frequent and heterogeneous immunity to neuronal autoantigens without a single specific antibody marker of OM, (2) the occasional detection of antibodies to known onconeuronal antigens (ie, Hu proteins) probably is related to cancer-induced immunity rather than to OM, and (3) the postsynaptic density is a frequent source of novel autoantigens, with several proteins of this complex targeted by antibodies of OM patients.",Journal Article,6170.0,113.0,Despite circumstantial evidence that opsoclonus-myoclonus OM is often immune mediated no specific autoantigen has been identified Using sera of 21 patients with several types of OM idiopathic associated to small cell cancer and associated to we probed a brainstem cDNA library to isolate target neuronal antigens Thirty-seven clones coding for 25 proteins were isolated with two groups of autoantigens emerging 1 proteins of the postsynaptic density among them the adenomatous polyposis coli and 2 proteins with expression or function restricted to neurons including RNA or DNA-binding proteins and zinc-finger proteins Usually each patient 's serum recognized a different autoantigen except for adenomatous polyposis coli that was recognized by sera of two patients with idiopathic OM and two control patients with nystagmus diplopia and paraneoplastic brainstem dysfunction Overall in the indicated types of OM 1 we found frequent and heterogeneous immunity to neuronal autoantigens without a single specific antibody marker of OM 2 the occasional detection of antibodies to known onconeuronal antigens ie Hu proteins probably is related to cancer-induced immunity rather than to OM and 3 the postsynaptic density is a frequent source of novel autoantigens with several proteins of this complex targeted by antibodies of OM patients,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[550, 37400, 241, 17, 53389, 24582, 7435, 16, 629, 250, 517, 77, 112, 33380, 71, 85, 108, 75, 4210, 1, 239, 7, 5, 392, 630, 1, 7435, 7540, 41, 6, 302, 31, 12, 2, 41, 6, 21, 16218, 8, 5720, 4212, 4157, 6, 7910, 283, 7020, 1575, 977, 648, 2749, 3097, 9, 243, 652, 11, 1355, 5, 100, 271, 1, 20227, 1478, 14, 652, 1, 3, 43171, 1263, 107, 1370, 3, 4865, 4198, 6959, 2, 18, 652, 5, 55, 15, 343, 2016, 6, 11930, 141, 893, 15, 261, 791, 652, 2, 5988, 8079, 652, 2082, 296, 69, 292, 524, 1904, 8, 338, 33380, 2187, 9, 4865, 4198, 6959, 17, 10, 1904, 20, 4210, 1, 100, 7, 5, 7540, 7435, 2, 100, 182, 7, 5, 30371, 18862, 2, 6544, 5720, 1527, 63, 4, 3, 1103, 630, 1, 7435, 14, 21, 204, 908, 2, 1564, 1604, 6, 7020, 20227, 187, 8, 226, 112, 548, 952, 1, 7435, 18, 3, 9753, 638, 1, 890, 6, 440, 53390, 1575, 2523, 5948, 652, 4061, 16, 139, 6, 12, 277, 1604, 1832, 76, 6, 7435, 2, 27, 3, 43171, 1263, 16, 8, 908, 2353, 1, 229, 20227, 5, 392, 652, 1, 26, 840, 238, 20, 890, 1, 7435, 7]",1334.0,12601702,354
Induction of caspase 8 by interferon gamma renders some neuroblastoma (NB) cells sensitive to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) but reveals that a lack of membrane TR1/TR2 also contributes to TRAIL resistance in NB.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2003-03-01,"The resistance of neuroblastoma (NB) cells to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis has been attributed to a lack of caspase 8 expression. Here we demonstrate a clinically applicable molecular targeting strategy that not only increases caspase 8 expression ex vivo in NB cell lines but also in the tumor tissues of NB patients receiving IFN-gamma treatment. We identify the functional caspase 8 promoter, which is different from the methylated region reported previously, and show promoter activity is up-regulated by IFN-gamma through a IFN-gamma activation site-containing region. IFN-gamma also induces TRAIL expression in NB cell lines. However, the IFN-gamma restoration of caspase 8 in some NB cells revealed persistent TRAIL resistance in most NB cell lines examined. This additional lesion in the TRAIL path is because of a loss of cell membrane TRAIL receptors (TR1/TR2) not only in cell lines but in most of the NB tumor tissues evaluated. Restoration of TR2 expression by transfection enhances IFN-gamma-induced TRAIL sensitivity.

Impact of metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy on assessing response of high-risk neuroblastoma to dose-intensive induction chemotherapy.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2003-03-01,"The International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (INRC) recommend, but do not make mandatory, metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scans. We present the first report on the effect of MIBG scans on the classification of response to dose-intensive induction therapy. After dose-intensive induction and before consolidative therapy, 162 Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) patients with high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) had MIBG scans (99 with (131)I, 63 with (123)I), computed tomography, (99m)Tc-bone scan, bone marrow (BM) tests, and urine catecholamine measurements. Induction included high-dose cyclophosphamide (140 mg/kg) plus other agents and high-dose cisplatin (200 mg/m(2))/etoposide (600 mg/m(2)). In 90 patients treated with dose-intensive therapy from diagnosis at MSKCC, the use of MIBG scintigraphy increased the incomplete response numbers from 14 (15.5%) to 20 (22%), giving a complete remission/very good partial remission (CR/VGPR) rate of 78%. In 72 patients treated before referral to MSKCC for intensified therapy, MIBG findings changed the response classification of one patient; the CR/VGPR rate was 43%. MIBG scans showed no BM disease in 15 of 38 patients with histologically evident NB in BM but did show uptake consistent with BM involvement in five patients who had no NB observed in BM tests.

Quantitation of GD2 synthase mRNA by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction: clinical utility in evaluating adjuvant therapy in neuroblastoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2003-03-01,"Minimal residual disease (MRD) is one of the final hurdles to cancer cure. Because therapy (myeloablation, immunotherapy, or differentiation) for MRD is applied at the time of clinical remission, objective surrogate markers are needed to gauge treatment efficacy. Using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of GD2 synthase (beta1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.92) mRNA, we evaluated MRD response to anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody 3F8 adjuvant therapy, namely, one cycle of radioimmunotherapy using iodine-131 ((131)I)-3F8 plus one cycle of unlabeled 3F8 in 45 stage 4 neuroblastoma patients (newly diagnosed or without prior relapse) on the N7 protocol at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The prognostic effect of MRD in their bone marrows before and after this phase of adjuvant therapy on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was also analyzed. Before 3F8 treatment, 24 of 45 patients were in complete remission (CR), 12 were in very good partial remission (VGPR), and nine were in partial remission (PR), according to criteria from International Neuroblastoma Staging System plus (131)I-3F8 scan; 71% had detectable tumor cells in marrow by real-time RT-PCR. Of the 32 positive patients, 20 became negative after therapy, with a 63% efficacy. When patients were stratified by CR/VGPR versus PR, GD2 synthase positivity was prognostic when detected before 3F8-targeted therapy (PFS, P =.045 and OS, P =.010). Persistent marker positivity was also predictive of PFS (P =.035) and OS (P =.027). Patients who succumbed to the disease had transcript levels four times higher than those who remain alive.

ID2 expression is not associated with MYCN amplification or expression in human neuroblastomas.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2003-04-01,"MYCN is a biologically and clinically important oncogene in human neuroblastoma as genomic amplification reliably predicts for aggressive tumor behavior and a poor prognosis. However, the mechanism by which MYCN amplification and overexpression contributes to a highly malignant phenotype remains obscure. ID2 is a dominant inhibitor of the RB1 tumor suppressor gene product and recently was suggested to be a direct transcriptional target of MYCN. Overexpression of Id2 protein has thus been postulated to result in functional inactivation of retinoblastoma in MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas, offering a potential explanation for the undifferentiated and highly proliferative nature of most MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas, as well as the paucity of retinoblastoma pathway mutations observed in clinical samples. We therefore sought to determine the likelihood that ID2 overexpression is associated with MYCN amplification and overexpression in human neuroblastoma. ID2 was not differentially expressed in 39 primary neuroblastoma specimens analyzed by oligonucleotide array-based expression analysis, and there was no correlation with MYCN expression levels. ID2 mRNA and protein expression was highly variable and independent of MYCN amplification status and mRNA expression in 10 human-derived neuroblastoma cell lines. In addition, ID2 mRNA expression was not associated with MYCN gene amplification status (P = 0.15) or MYCN expression (r = 0.22) in 131 separate diagnostic primary neuroblastoma samples analyzed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR.

Curability of recurrent disseminated disease after surgery alone for local-regional neuroblastoma using intensive chemotherapy and anti-G(D2) immunotherapy.,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol.,2003-07-01,"A reluctance to treat local-regional neuroblastoma by surgery alone derives partly from concern that if widespread neuroblastoma develops, the chance for cure is small, and partly from hope that mild chemotherapy will prevent relapse. The authors report on a series of patients who had distant recurrences after surgery alone for local-regional neuroblastoma. Seven patients treated with surgery alone for local-regional neuroblastoma had widespread relapses 2.5 to 25 (median 7) months later and were treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). During the period of this study (1995-1999), MSKCC patients with high-risk neuroblastoma received the N7 protocol (dose-intensive chemotherapy, immunotherapy with the anti-G(D2) 3F8 antibody, targeted radiotherapy using 131I-3F8, local radiotherapy) if they had assessable disease, or 3F8 plus granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) followed by 13-cis-retinoic acid if they were in remission after treatment elsewhere. Five patients were in complete remission 3 years 11 months to 7 years 4 months from the start of retrieval therapy, including three who received all of their N7 treatment of relapsed neuroblastoma at MSKCC, one who received two cycles of chemotherapy elsewhere before starting N7, and one who was referred for 3F8/GM-CSF because of neuroblastoma cells in pretransplantation bone marrow. The encouraging survival results of our cohort are consistent with the concept that surgery alone for local-regional neuroblastoma might be beneficial to the overall neuroblastoma population because many patients will never need chemotherapy (and will therefore be spared its potential toxicities), and most of those who do have widespread relapses are likely to be cured with contemporary treatments.",Journal Article,6048.0,19.0,A reluctance to treat local-regional by surgery alone derives partly from concern that if widespread develops the chance for cure is small and partly from hope that mild chemotherapy will prevent relapse The authors report on a series of patients who had distant recurrences after surgery alone for local-regional Seven patients treated with surgery alone for local-regional had widespread relapses 2.5 to 25 median 7 months later and were treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center MSKCC During the period of this study 1995-1999 MSKCC patients with high-risk received the N7 protocol dose-intensive chemotherapy immunotherapy with the anti-G D2 3F8 antibody targeted radiotherapy using 131I-3F8 local radiotherapy if they had assessable disease or 3F8 plus granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor GM-CSF followed by 13-cis-retinoic acid if they were in remission after treatment elsewhere Five patients were in complete remission 3 years 11 months to 7 years 4 months from the start of retrieval therapy including three who received all of their N7 treatment of relapsed at MSKCC one who received two cycles of chemotherapy elsewhere before starting N7 and one who was referred for 3F8/GM-CSF because of cells in pretransplantation marrow The encouraging survival results of our cohort are consistent with the concept that surgery alone for local-regional might be beneficial to the overall population because many patients will never need chemotherapy and will therefore be spared its potential toxicities and most of those who do have widespread relapses are likely to be cured with contemporary treatments,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[8, 13872, 6, 943, 293, 951, 20, 152, 279, 17214, 5180, 29, 2893, 17, 492, 3029, 4734, 3, 3477, 9, 1722, 16, 302, 2, 5180, 29, 3045, 17, 1980, 56, 303, 1682, 429, 3, 738, 414, 23, 8, 988, 1, 7, 54, 42, 626, 1593, 50, 152, 279, 9, 293, 951, 648, 7, 73, 5, 152, 279, 9, 293, 951, 42, 3029, 3713, 18, 33, 6, 243, 52, 67, 53, 1559, 2, 11, 73, 28, 2563, 2783, 2784, 12, 574, 4191, 190, 3, 727, 1, 26, 45, 2323, 2043, 4191, 7, 5, 64, 43, 103, 3, 21046, 1182, 61, 1686, 56, 726, 5, 3, 312, 499, 4171, 5970, 548, 238, 310, 75, 12982, 5970, 293, 310, 492, 491, 42, 3120, 34, 15, 5970, 349, 2764, 2674, 1975, 2122, 161, 2147, 1211, 370, 20, 233, 1927, 3887, 971, 492, 491, 11, 4, 734, 50, 24, 7116, 365, 7, 11, 4, 236, 734, 27, 60, 175, 53, 6, 67, 60, 39, 53, 29, 3, 2435, 1, 8372, 36, 141, 169, 54, 103, 62, 1, 136, 21046, 24, 1, 591, 28, 4191, 104, 54, 103, 100, 410, 1, 56, 7116, 348, 1723, 21046, 2, 104, 54, 10, 1995, 9, 5970, 2147, 1211, 408, 1, 37, 4, 9367, 581, 3, 2269, 25, 99, 1, 114, 180, 32, 925, 5, 3, 2545, 17, 152, 279, 9, 293, 951, 822, 40, 2524, 6, 3, 63, 266, 408, 445, 7, 303, 1737, 594, 56, 2, 303, 673, 40, 6830, 211, 174, 385, 2, 96, 1, 135, 54, 1022, 47, 3029, 3713, 32, 322, 6, 40, 3733, 5, 2667, 640]",1626.0,12847316,84
Evolving significance of prognostic markers associated with new treatment strategies in neuroblastoma.,Cancer letters,Cancer Lett.,2003-07-01,"The striking differences in the natural history of clinical subgroups of neuroblastoma (NB), and the evolving therapeutic approaches for each, makes it imperative for prognostic markers to be reevaluated within individual clinical categories. At least one third of NB cases present without distant metastasis and cytotoxic therapy does not alter the natural history. We carried out a retrospective analysis of archived tumor samples. Fifty-seven of these patients had local-regional (LR) NB and were managed conservatively, initially treated with surgery alone. Among the biologic and clinical features analyzed including age, stage, histology, ploidy, MYCN, and 1p36, 1p22, 11q, 14q, 9p and 19q loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in multivariate analysis, diploidy was one of the most significant factors associated with progression-free survival and stage 4 progression. Clonal ploidy heterogeneity was common in LR NB. A predominant near-triploid clonal population was found in most cases of non-progressing LR NB tumors whereas progressing LR NB cases had a predominant diploid clone. We also reviewed the prognostic factors among 84 stage 4 NB cases treated with the N5, N6 or N7 protocols at MSKCC from 1987 to 1999. Traditional markers such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, age and MYCN status were not prognostic in the univariate analysis. 11q23 and 1p22 LOH were correlated with better survival. These results highlight the evolving significance of prognostic analysis in homogeneous clinical groups undergoing similar treatments. To further characterize the gene expression profile between local-regional and metastatic NB, we carried out Microarray analysis of 41 NB tumors and 12 NB cell lines, using the Affymetrix Genechip Human Genome U95 Set. Distinct gene expression patterns between metastatic and non-metastatic NB tumors have been identified. Validation of these results and further mechanistic studies may shed new light on the biology of metastasis in human NB.",Journal Article,6048.0,24.0,The striking differences in the natural history of clinical subgroups of NB and the evolving therapeutic approaches for each makes it imperative for prognostic markers to be reevaluated within individual clinical categories At least one third of NB cases present without distant metastasis and cytotoxic therapy does not alter the natural history We carried out a retrospective analysis of archived tumor samples Fifty-seven of these patients had local-regional LR NB and were managed conservatively initially treated with surgery alone Among the biologic and clinical features analyzed including age stage histology ploidy MYCN and 1p36 1p22 11q 14q 9p and 19q loss of heterozygosity LOH in multivariate analysis diploidy was one of the most significant factors associated with progression-free survival and stage 4 progression Clonal ploidy heterogeneity was common in LR NB A predominant near-triploid clonal population was found in most cases of non-progressing LR NB tumors whereas progressing LR NB cases had a predominant diploid clone We also reviewed the prognostic factors among 84 stage 4 NB cases treated with the N5 N6 or N7 protocols at MSKCC from 1987 to 1999 Traditional markers such as lactate dehydrogenase LDH ferritin age and MYCN status were not prognostic in the univariate analysis 11q23 and 1p22 LOH were correlated with better survival These results highlight the evolving significance of prognostic analysis in homogeneous clinical groups undergoing similar treatments To further characterize the gene expression profile between local-regional and metastatic NB we carried out Microarray analysis of 41 NB tumors and 12 NB cell lines using the Affymetrix Genechip Human Genome U95 Set Distinct gene expression patterns between metastatic and non-metastatic NB tumors have been identified Validation of these results and further mechanistic studies may shed new light on the biology of metastasis in human NB,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 5133, 362, 4, 3, 1504, 532, 1, 38, 1453, 1, 3446, 2, 3, 3276, 189, 611, 9, 296, 4677, 192, 6305, 9, 177, 525, 6, 40, 13874, 262, 797, 38, 1996, 28, 506, 104, 1282, 1, 3446, 140, 364, 187, 626, 278, 2, 759, 36, 1097, 44, 2688, 3, 1504, 532, 21, 2629, 1205, 8, 459, 65, 1, 6282, 30, 347, 1461, 648, 1, 46, 7, 42, 293, 951, 2030, 3446, 2, 11, 2231, 10296, 1625, 73, 5, 152, 279, 107, 3, 1283, 2, 38, 404, 311, 141, 89, 82, 784, 9032, 4068, 2, 12265, 27942, 7203, 13756, 11234, 2, 5011, 407, 1, 3963, 2594, 4, 331, 65, 19586, 10, 104, 1, 3, 96, 93, 130, 41, 5, 91, 115, 25, 2, 82, 39, 91, 1946, 9032, 1144, 10, 186, 4, 2030, 3446, 8, 2750, 1829, 23252, 1946, 266, 10, 204, 4, 96, 140, 1, 220, 4527, 2030, 3446, 57, 547, 4527, 2030, 3446, 140, 42, 8, 2750, 6815, 3910, 21, 120, 446, 3, 177, 130, 107, 874, 82, 39, 3446, 140, 73, 5, 3, 33278, 33279, 15, 21046, 2189, 28, 4191, 29, 5450, 6, 2043, 1847, 525, 225, 22, 3330, 2374, 4592, 9101, 89, 2, 4068, 156, 11, 44, 177, 4, 3, 880, 65, 7975, 2, 27942, 2594, 11, 438, 5, 380, 25, 46, 99, 1817, 3, 3276, 724, 1, 177, 65, 4, 5642, 38, 271, 479, 288, 640, 6, 195, 1507, 3, 145, 55, 800, 59, 293, 951, 2, 113, 3446, 21, 2629, 1205, 1727, 65, 1, 605, 3446, 57, 2, 133, 3446, 31, 285, 75, 3, 5318, 16297, 171, 898, 37508, 916, 834, 145, 55, 764, 59, 113, 2, 220, 113, 3446, 57, 47, 85, 108, 929, 1, 46, 99, 2, 195, 2716, 94, 68, 5816, 217, 1691, 23, 3, 891, 1, 278, 4, 171, 3446]",1933.0,12880970,153
Genomic structure and mutational analysis of the human KIF1Balpha gene located at 1p36.2 in neuroblastoma.,International journal of oncology,Int. J. Oncol.,2003-09-01,"KIF1a is a member of the kinesin superfamily proteins that are microtubule-dependent molecular motors involved in important intracellular functions such as organelle transport and cell division. We previously determined the structure of the human KIF1Bbeta gene, which was found to be a homologue of the murine Kif1bbeta, and demonstrated that the human KIF1Bbeta is a causative gene of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A although we did not prove that it is a tumor suppressor gene of neuroblastoma. Here, we identified another isoform of the human KIF1B gene, KIF1Balpha. The KIF1Balpha and KIF1Bbeta are alternative splicing products of the KIF1B gene located on 1p36.2. The KIF1Balpha is distinct from KIF1Bbeta in the C-terminal cargo-binding domain; however, they have the same N-terminal motor domain. We found that the transcript of approximately 7.8 kb of KIF1Balpha was expressed in several tissues, especially in skeletal muscle, by Northern blot analysis. To determine whether this gene is one of the candidate tumor suppressor genes for neuroblastoma (NB) or other pediatric solid tumors, we performed mutational screening of KIF1Balpha in 25 NB, 9 rhabdomyosarcoma, 12 Ewing sarcoma and 24 other pediatric solid tumor cell lines. Using RT-PCR single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing we detected a missense mutation (M807I) in 1 NB cell line (SK-N-SH), 3 silent mutations in 2 NB cell lines and 1 primitive neuroectodermal tumor cell line, respectively. RT-PCR analysis revealed that KIF1Balpha was obviously expressed in almost all of the tumor cell lines examined except NB-1. Furthermore, real-time quantitative RT-PCR showed that there was no significant difference in KIF1Balpha expression between 14 early-stage (stage I and II) and 14 advanced-stage (stage III and IV) NB fresh tumor specimens. These results suggest that KIF1Ba in addition to KIF1Bbeta may not be a candidate tumor suppressor gene for NB.",Journal Article,5986.0,,KIF1a is a member of the kinesin superfamily proteins that are microtubule-dependent molecular motors involved in important intracellular functions such as organelle transport and cell division We previously determined the structure of the human KIF1Bbeta gene which was found to be a homologue of the murine Kif1bbeta and demonstrated that the human KIF1Bbeta is a causative gene of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A although we did not prove that it is a tumor suppressor gene of Here we identified another isoform of the human KIF1B gene KIF1Balpha The KIF1Balpha and KIF1Bbeta are alternative splicing products of the KIF1B gene located on 1p36.2 The KIF1Balpha is distinct from KIF1Bbeta in the C-terminal cargo-binding domain however they have the same N-terminal motor domain We found that the transcript of approximately 7.8 kb of KIF1Balpha was expressed in several tissues especially in skeletal muscle by Northern blot analysis To determine whether this gene is one of the candidate tumor suppressor genes for NB or other pediatric solid tumors we performed mutational screening of KIF1Balpha in 25 NB 9 12 and 24 other pediatric solid tumor cell lines Using RT-PCR single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing we detected a missense mutation M807I in 1 NB cell line SK-N-SH 3 silent mutations in 2 NB cell lines and 1 primitive neuroectodermal tumor cell line respectively RT-PCR analysis revealed that KIF1Balpha was obviously expressed in almost all of the tumor cell lines examined except NB-1 Furthermore real-time quantitative RT-PCR showed that there was no significant difference in KIF1Balpha expression between 14 early-stage stage I and II and 14 advanced-stage stage III and IV NB fresh tumor specimens These results suggest that KIF1Ba in addition to KIF1Bbeta may not be a candidate tumor suppressor gene for NB,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[33487, 16, 8, 2693, 1, 3, 14193, 8845, 652, 17, 32, 4621, 470, 219, 43319, 646, 4, 305, 2087, 1681, 225, 22, 22129, 4294, 2, 31, 5750, 21, 373, 509, 3, 2772, 1, 3, 171, 22130, 145, 92, 10, 204, 6, 40, 8, 7907, 1, 3, 1471, 22130, 2, 264, 17, 3, 171, 22130, 16, 8, 8088, 145, 1, 33409, 23208, 14813, 34, 267, 4707, 242, 21, 205, 44, 4361, 17, 192, 16, 8, 30, 1245, 145, 1, 467, 21, 108, 1809, 3995, 1, 3, 171, 43320, 145, 26197, 3, 26197, 2, 22130, 32, 1091, 3895, 2766, 1, 3, 43320, 145, 2308, 23, 12265, 18, 3, 26197, 16, 834, 29, 22130, 4, 3, 256, 2158, 21176, 791, 1398, 137, 491, 47, 3, 827, 78, 2158, 3482, 1398, 21, 204, 17, 3, 3268, 1, 705, 67, 66, 5116, 1, 26197, 10, 570, 4, 392, 742, 1093, 4, 2621, 1502, 20, 7088, 2639, 65, 6, 223, 317, 26, 145, 16, 104, 1, 3, 1609, 30, 1245, 214, 9, 3446, 15, 127, 815, 537, 57, 21, 173, 1619, 453, 1, 26197, 4, 243, 3446, 83, 133, 2, 259, 127, 815, 537, 30, 31, 285, 75, 240, 604, 226, 4787, 7788, 1907, 65, 2, 1196, 615, 21, 530, 8, 4007, 258, 53662, 4, 14, 3446, 31, 328, 9845, 78, 9225, 27, 9890, 138, 4, 18, 3446, 31, 285, 2, 14, 5594, 7160, 30, 31, 328, 106, 240, 604, 65, 553, 17, 26197, 10, 13567, 570, 4, 2214, 62, 1, 3, 30, 31, 285, 409, 2187, 3446, 14, 798, 1589, 98, 1156, 240, 604, 224, 17, 125, 10, 77, 93, 523, 4, 26197, 55, 59, 213, 191, 82, 82, 70, 2, 215, 2, 213, 131, 82, 82, 316, 2, 478, 3446, 4329, 30, 623, 46, 99, 309, 17, 53663, 4, 352, 6, 22130, 68, 44, 40, 8, 1609, 30, 1245, 145, 9, 3446]",1864.0,12888911,124
Oral topotecan for refractory and relapsed neuroblastoma: a retrospective analysis.,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol.,2003-08-01,"Among patients with multiply relapsed neuroblastoma refractory to conventional chemotherapy, oral topotecan has often been used for palliation. Although toxicity was generally thought to be mild, the efficacy of such an approach remains unproven. The authors retrospectively analyzed patients with multiply relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma who were treated with oral topotecan for palliation. Each course was generally 1 mg/m2/d in two divided doses, for 21 consecutive days, repeated after a 1-week rest in patients without symptoms of progressive disease. Disease status was assessed by radiographic studies, urine catecholamine levels, and multiple bone marrow aspirations and biopsies. Twenty patients between the ages of 3 and 34 (median 13 years) received 1 (n = 7), 2 (n = 3), 3 (n = 4), 4 (n = 2), 6 (n = 2), and 12 courses (n = 2). Prior treatments included multiple cycles of high-dose alkylator-based chemotherapy (n = 20), high-dose intravenous topotecan (n = 8), myeloablative chemotherapy or radioimmunotherapy (n = 10), or experimental biologic agents (n = 16). Anti-neuroblastoma effects were seen in five patients lasting 6 to 12 months; two additional patients remained stable for 4 months. Thirteen patients had progressive disease (11 after one or two cycles). Toxicity included diarrhea (n = 12) requiring a dose adjustment in three patients and discontinuation of the drug in a fourth, and myelosuppression (n = 11) requiring transfusion and/or granulocyte-colony stimulating factor support. Oral topotecan therapy has antitumor activity in a small percentage of patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma. Toxicities, including diarrhea and myelosuppression, may necessitate a dose adjustment in this patient population.

Genome-wide analysis of gene expression associated with MYCN in human neuroblastoma.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2003-08-01,"Molecular mechanisms through which MYCN expression contributes to the malignant phenotype of neuroblastoma are unknown. We performed a genome-widegene expression analysis of 40 well-characterized neuroblastic tumors and 12 cell lines to identify genes and biological pathways associated with MYCN expression. Gene expression was validated by reverse transcription-PCR and immunohistochemistry using tissue arrays. Two hundred twenty-two of 62,839 oligonucleotide probe sets detected expression of genes that were strongly associated with MYCN expression. Differentially expressed genes included examples of known oncogenes, genes associated with neural differentiation, and genes related to cell proliferation. Expression of a subset of these genes was altered after transfection of a neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-ER, with a MYCN expressing gene construct when protein synthesis was inhibited and have consensus MYCN binding E-box sequences in their promotor regions, suggesting they represent direct targets.

Early molecular response of marrow disease to biologic therapy is highly prognostic in neuroblastoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2003-10-01,"A promising treatment strategy for stage 4 neuroblastoma patients is the repeated application of anti-GD2 immunotherapy after activating myeloid effectors with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). To use early marrow response as a prognostic marker is particularly relevant for patients not likely to benefit from this therapy. Eighty-six stage 4 neuroblastoma patients older than 1 year at diagnosis were classified in four clinical groups on protocol entry: complete remission or very good partial remission (n = 33), primary refractory (n = 33), secondary refractory (n = 10), and progressive disease (n = 10). Bone marrow samples collected before and following treatment were assayed for GD2 synthase mRNA by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Response and survival analyses were performed on posttreatment samples before the third cycle at 1.8 months from protocol entry. GD2 synthase mRNA was evident in pretreatment marrow samples of the four clinical groups (42%, 52%, 60%, and 80% of samples, respectively), with median transcript level of 10.0, 16.6, 26.5, and 87.2, respectively. This marker became negative following antibody plus GM-CSF in 77% of complete remission or very good partial remission, 45% of primary refractory, 25% of secondary refractory, and 0% of progressive disease group. Progression-free survival was statistically different between responder and nonresponder groups (P <.0001). Among patients with minimal residual disease, molecular responders had a significantly lower risk of disease progression at a median follow-up of 29.8 months (P =.0001).

Induction of chromosomal instability in colonic cells by the human polyomavirus JC virus.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2003-11-01,"Most colorectal cancers display chromosomal instability, which is characterized by gross chromosomal rearrangements, loss of heterozygosity and aneuploidy. We have previously demonstrated a link between JC virus strains Mad-1 and Delta98 and colorectal cancer. Others have also associated the virus to the induction of colon cancer and aneuploid brain tumors by producing a highly tumorigenic protein named T antigen (TAg), which binds to beta-catenin and inactivates key proteins such as p53. The aim is to demonstrate that JC virus is capable of inducing chromosomal instability in colonic cells. We used the human colon cancer cell line RKO as a model. The cell line has wild-type p53, wild-type beta-catenin and APC and is diploid. Neuroblastoma JCI cells, which are infected with the virus, VA13 fibroblasts, which are transformed by the SV40 TAg, were used as positive controls. HCT116, which has mutated beta-catenin, and SW480, which is a model of CIN, were also used as controls. The genomes of the Mad-1 and Delta98 strains were transfected into cells. As negative controls we used pUC or no plasmids. Cells were collected at 0, 7, 14, and 21 days after transfection. PCR was used for the detection of TAg and the regulatory region DNA sequences at different time frames and Southern blot of whole genomic extracts for viral DNA integration into the host genome. Immunofluorescence and Western blot were performed for TAg, viral capsid proteins, and nuclear beta-catenin expressions, whereas coimmunoprecipitation was used to detect protein interactions. Karyotype analysis and electron microscopy were performed to seek chromosomal instability and cell abnormalities, respectively. Retention of viral sequences was observed for Mad-1- and Delta98-transfected RKO cells at all time frames with PCR only, whereas Southern blot analysis showed nonintegrated sequences at T7 alone. TAg and capsid protein expressions, as well as increased p53 and nuclear beta-catenin, were observed between T0 and T7 for Mad-1 and Delta98 alone. Also, interaction between TAg and both p53 and beta-catenin was also observed between T0 and T7. Chromosomal instability, characterized by chromosomal breakage, dicentric chromosomes, and increasing ploidy, was observed at all time frames for Mad-1 and Delta98, as well as cell abnormalities. In conclusion, we demonstrate that JC virus Mad-1 and Delta98 are able to induce chromosomal instability in colonic cells with a hit and run mechanism that involves an early interaction with beta-catenin and p53.",Journal Article,5925.0,95.0,Most cancers display chromosomal instability which is characterized by gross chromosomal rearrangements loss of heterozygosity and aneuploidy We have previously demonstrated a link between JC virus strains Mad-1 and Delta98 and cancer Others have also associated the virus to the induction of cancer and aneuploid brain tumors by producing a highly tumorigenic protein named T antigen TAg which binds to beta-catenin and inactivates key proteins such as p53 The aim is to demonstrate that JC virus is capable of inducing chromosomal instability in colonic cells We used the human cancer cell line RKO as a model The cell line has wild-type p53 wild-type beta-catenin and APC and is diploid JCI cells which are infected with the virus VA13 fibroblasts which are transformed by the SV40 TAg were used as positive controls HCT116 which has mutated beta-catenin and SW480 which is a model of CIN were also used as controls The genomes of the Mad-1 and Delta98 strains were transfected into cells As negative controls we used pUC or no plasmids Cells were collected at 0 7 14 and 21 days after transfection PCR was used for the detection of TAg and the regulatory region DNA sequences at different time frames and Southern blot of whole genomic extracts for viral DNA integration into the host genome Immunofluorescence and Western blot were performed for TAg viral capsid proteins and nuclear beta-catenin expressions whereas coimmunoprecipitation was used to detect protein interactions Karyotype analysis and electron microscopy were performed to seek chromosomal instability and cell abnormalities respectively Retention of viral sequences was observed for Mad-1- and Delta98-transfected RKO cells at all time frames with PCR only whereas Southern blot analysis showed nonintegrated sequences at T7 alone TAg and capsid protein expressions as well as increased p53 and nuclear beta-catenin were observed between T0 and T7 for Mad-1 and Delta98 alone Also interaction between TAg and both p53 and beta-catenin was also observed between T0 and T7 Chromosomal instability characterized by chromosomal breakage dicentric chromosomes and increasing ploidy was observed at all time frames for Mad-1 and Delta98 as well as cell abnormalities In conclusion we demonstrate that JC virus Mad-1 and Delta98 are able to induce chromosomal instability in colonic cells with a hit and run mechanism that involves an early interaction with beta-catenin and p53,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[96, 163, 3640, 1860, 1753, 92, 16, 765, 20, 1789, 1860, 2072, 407, 1, 3963, 2, 7437, 21, 47, 373, 264, 8, 3460, 59, 13323, 1450, 5175, 23278, 14, 2, 28143, 2, 12, 1749, 47, 120, 41, 3, 1450, 6, 3, 504, 1, 12, 2, 11781, 342, 57, 20, 3787, 8, 561, 3795, 178, 8373, 102, 448, 7479, 92, 3333, 6, 1090, 1778, 2, 14521, 825, 652, 225, 22, 624, 3, 1130, 16, 6, 608, 17, 13323, 1450, 16, 2787, 1, 1958, 1860, 1753, 4, 3663, 37, 21, 95, 3, 171, 12, 31, 328, 11736, 22, 8, 202, 3, 31, 328, 71, 955, 267, 624, 955, 267, 1090, 1778, 2, 2528, 2, 16, 6815, 28144, 37, 92, 32, 3369, 5, 3, 1450, 53853, 3921, 92, 32, 2423, 20, 3, 9734, 7479, 11, 95, 22, 109, 535, 4522, 92, 71, 1185, 1090, 1778, 2, 9094, 92, 16, 8, 202, 1, 4652, 11, 120, 95, 22, 535, 3, 5085, 1, 3, 23278, 14, 2, 28143, 5175, 11, 3245, 237, 37, 22, 199, 535, 21, 95, 12817, 15, 77, 12473, 37, 11, 786, 28, 13, 67, 213, 2, 239, 162, 50, 3789, 604, 10, 95, 9, 3, 638, 1, 7479, 2, 3, 1253, 1053, 261, 2866, 28, 338, 98, 13302, 2, 7525, 2639, 1, 902, 572, 8162, 9, 1667, 261, 2676, 237, 3, 1204, 898, 4130, 2, 1521, 2639, 11, 173, 9, 7479, 1667, 17237, 652, 2, 928, 1090, 1778, 4249, 547, 15888, 10, 95, 6, 1426, 178, 1286, 3385, 65, 2, 4560, 3804, 11, 173, 6, 6606, 1860, 1753, 2, 31, 1171, 106, 3947, 1, 1667, 2866, 10, 164, 9, 23278, 14, 2, 28143, 3245, 11736, 37, 28, 62, 98, 13302, 5, 604, 158, 547, 7525, 2639, 65, 224, 37577, 2866, 28, 20192, 279, 7479, 2, 17237, 178, 4249, 22, 149, 22, 101, 624, 2, 928, 1090, 1778, 11, 164, 59, 11567, 2, 20192, 9, 23278, 14, 2, 28143, 279, 120, 915, 59, 7479, 2, 110, 624, 2, 1090, 1778, 10, 120, 164, 59, 11567, 2, 20192, 1860, 1753, 765, 20, 1860, 14101, 33550, 3560, 2, 602, 9032, 10, 164, 28, 62, 98, 13302, 9, 23278, 14, 2, 28143, 22, 149, 22, 31, 1171, 4, 1221, 21, 608, 17, 13323, 1450, 23278, 14, 2, 28143, 32, 1665, 6, 1290, 1860, 1753, 4, 3663, 37, 5, 8, 6519, 2, 7726, 670, 17, 2921, 35, 191, 915, 5, 1090, 1778, 2, 624]",2444.0,14612521,219
Consistent antibody response against ganglioside GD2 induced in patients with melanoma by a GD2 lactone-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate vaccine plus immunological adjuvant QS-21.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2003-11-01,"Melanomas, sarcomas, and neuroblastomas abundantly express the ganglioside GD2 on the cell surface where it is susceptible to immune attack by antibodies. Overexpression of GD2 on these tumors is striking, as is the frequency of clinical responses after treatment of neuroblastoma with monoclonal antibodies against GD2. In addition, preclinical models have demonstrated the ability of a GD2-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) conjugate vaccine to induce antibodies that eliminate micrometastases. However, vaccination of patients with GD2-KLH has previously failed to induce a consistent relevant antibody response. We test here whether the use of GD2 lactone-KLH can overcome the low immunogenicity of GD2-KLH. Eighteen patients with melanoma were vaccinated s.c. in the adjuvant setting on weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 10, and 24. Groups of 6 patients were entered at three dose levels (3, 10, or 30 micro g) of GD2 lactone (GD2L) in vaccines containing GD2L-KLH plus the immunological adjuvant QS-21. Blood was drawn at regular intervals to assess the antibody response. The vaccine was well tolerated. The majority of patients in all three dose levels produced anti-GD2 antibodies detectable by ELISA assay. Specificity for GD2 was also confirmed by immune thin-layer chromatography. Although there was no statistical difference in terms of titers between the three groups, patients at the 30- micro g dose level had higher titers and longer lasting antibody responses overall by ELISA (median IgM/IgG peak titer 1:640/1:80) and generated the strongest cell surface reactivity by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (median IgM peak percentage positive cells/mean fluorescence intensity for pre- and postvaccination sera is 10%/63 and 70%/135). Patients vaccinated with the 30- micro g GD2 dose also had the most potent complement dependent cytotoxicity using human complement, with 5 of 6 patients showing strong cell surface reactivity by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and >30% cytotoxicity by chromium release with a serum dilution of 1/100.

Thyroid carcinoma presenting in childhood or after treatment of childhood malignancies: An institutional experience and review of the literature.,Journal of pediatric surgery,J. Pediatr. Surg.,2003-11-01,"Thyroid carcinomas can occur as a primary malignancy (PTM) or secondary after another malignancy (STM). Information about the presentations and outcomes of patients with STM are limited. The authors sought to compare the clinical characteristics, course, and outcomes of patients with primary or secondary thyroid malignancies. The authors reviewed the medical records of 8 children with PTM and 17 children with STM referred to St Jude Children's Research Hospital between February 1962 and February 2002 for evaluation and treatment of malignant thyroid carcinoma. The 8 children who had primary thyroid carcinoma had it diagnosed at a median age of 12.5 years (range, 7.3 to 16.3 years). Seven patients had papillary carcinoma, and 1 patient had follicular carcinoma. Three of the 8 (37.5%) had metastatic disease involving regional lymph nodes; 2 patients (25.0%) had lung metastases. Six patients required radioactive iodine (I 131) ablation for residual or metastatic disease after surgical resection. All 8 patients remain alive a median of 22.6 years after diagnosis (range, 0.7 to 30.5 years); 1 continues to receive radioactive iodine (I 131) ablation for persistent disease. Seventeen patients had thyroid carcinoma as a second malignant neoplasm after treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 6), Hodgkin's disease (n = 5), central nervous system tumor (n = 2), Wilms' tumor (n = 1), retinoblastoma (n = 1), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 1), or neuroblastoma (n = 1). Patients with secondary thyroid carcinoma presented at a median age of 21.5 years (range, 15.3 to 42.6 years), a median of 16.2 years (range, 0.9 to 29.2 years) after diagnosis of the primary cancer. Twelve of the 17 patients (70.6%) had received radiation to the thyroid gland during therapy for the primary cancer. Four patients (23.5%) had metastatic disease involving regional lymph nodes.

Tumor suppression by a rationally designed reversible inhibitor of methionine aminopeptidase-2.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2003-11-01,"Methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP)-2 has been suggested as a novel target for cancer therapy because the anticancer agent TNP-470 irreversibly inactivates the catalytic activity of this enzyme. However, the importance of MetAP2 in cell growth and tumor progression was uncertain because previous data were based on the chemically reactive TNP-470. Here we show that a rationally designed reversible MetAP2 inhibitor, A-357300, suppresses tumor growth preclinically without the toxicities observed with TNP-470. We have synthesized this bestatin-type MetAP2 inhibitor with the aid of crystal structures of the enzyme-inhibitor complexes and parallel synthesis. A-357300 induces cytostasis by cell cycle arrest at the G(1) phase selectively in endothelial cells and in a subset of tumor cells, but not in most primary cells of nonendothelial type. A-357300 inhibits angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo and shows potent antitumor efficacy in carcinoma, sarcoma, and neuroblastoma murine models.

Primary tumor control in patients with stage 3/4 unfavorable neuroblastoma treated with tandem double autologous stem cell transplants.,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol.,2003-12-01,"To assess the efficacy and toxicity of local radiotherapy in achieving local control in patients with stage 4 or high-risk stage 3 neuroblastoma treated with induction chemotherapy and tandem stem cell transplants. Fifty-two children with stage 4 or high-risk stage 3 neuroblastoma were treated on a standardized protocol that included five cycles of induction chemotherapy, surgical resection of the primary tumor when feasible, local radiotherapy, and then consolidation with tandem myeloablative cycles with autologous peripheral blood stem cell rescue. Local radiotherapy (10.5-18 Gy) was administered to patients with gross or microscopic residual disease prior to the myeloablative cycles. Thirty-seven patients received local radiotherapy to the primary tumor or primary tumor bed. Two patients with unknown primaries each received radiotherapy to single, unresectable, bulky metastatic sites. The second of the myeloablative regimens included 12 Gy of total body irradiation. Of the 52 consecutively treated patients analyzed, 44 underwent both transplants, 6 underwent a single transplant, and 2 progressed during induction. Local radiotherapy did not prolong recovery of hematopoiesis following transplants, did not increase peritransplant morbidity, and did not prolong the hospital stay compared with patients who had not received local radiotherapy. Local control was excellent. Of 11 patients with disease recurrence after completion of therapy, 9 failed in bony metastatic sites 3 to 21 months after the completion of therapy, 1 recurred 67 months following therapy in the previously bulky metastatic site that had been irradiated, and 1 had local recurrence concurrent with distant progression 15 months following the second transplant. The three-year event-free survival was 63%, with a median follow-up of 29.5 months. The actuarial probability of local control was 97%.

Detection of single-copy chromosome 17q gain in human neuroblastomas using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2003-12-01,"Regional genomic alterations resulting from single-copy allelic loss or gain have been well characterized in many human cancers and are often of prognostic relevance. Unbalanced gain of 17q material is common in malignant human neuroblastomas and typically results from unbalanced translocations. Unbalanced 17q gain may be an independent predictor of disease outcome, but technical difficulties with quantifying such gain using fluorescent in situ hybridization gives this method limited clinical applicability. We now describe a duplex genomic DNA-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay to determine the presence or absence of unbalanced gain of chromosome 17q in primary neuroblastoma specimens. The technique was first refined and validated in a panel of nine human neuroblastoma-derived cell lines by direct comparison with dual-color fluorescent in situ hybridization. Prospective blinded comparison of quantitative polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization in 40 human neuroblastoma primary tumor samples showed a sensitivity of 96% and 100% specificity for detecting unbalanced 17q gain when a relative 17q copy number ratio of 1.3 was used to define unbalanced gain. Tumors with ratios >1.3 were highly associated with malignant tumor phenotypic features such as metastatic disease (P <.0001) and tumor MYCN amplification (P =.008). These data suggest that quantitative polymerase chain reaction determination of 17q status is feasible and highly specific in primary tumor samples. Sensitivity may be limited because of the inherent complexity of both the chromosomal rearrangements and heterogeneity of some tumor samples. Taken together, quantitative polymerase chain reaction can be used as a high-throughput screening tool for 17q aberrations, but a subset of samples may also require fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis in an attempt to conclusively determine 17q allelic status.",Comparative Study,5895.0,21.0,Regional genomic alterations resulting from single-copy allelic loss or gain have been well characterized in many human cancers and are often of prognostic relevance Unbalanced gain of 17q material is common in malignant human neuroblastomas and typically results from unbalanced translocations Unbalanced 17q gain may be an independent predictor of disease outcome but technical difficulties with quantifying such gain using fluorescent in situ hybridization gives this method limited clinical applicability We now describe a duplex genomic DNA-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay to determine the presence or absence of unbalanced gain of chromosome 17q in primary specimens The technique was first refined and validated in a panel of nine human neuroblastoma-derived cell lines by direct comparison with dual-color fluorescent in situ hybridization Prospective blinded comparison of quantitative polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization in 40 human primary tumor samples showed a sensitivity of 96 and 100 specificity for detecting unbalanced 17q gain when a relative 17q copy number ratio of 1.3 was used to define unbalanced gain Tumors with ratios 1.3 were highly associated with malignant tumor phenotypic features such as metastatic disease P .0001 and tumor MYCN amplification P =.008 These data suggest that quantitative polymerase chain reaction determination of 17q status is feasible and highly specific in primary tumor samples Sensitivity may be limited because of the inherent complexity of both the chromosomal rearrangements and heterogeneity of some tumor samples Taken together quantitative polymerase chain reaction can be used as a high-throughput screening tool for 17q aberrations but a subset of samples may also require fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis in an attempt to conclusively determine 17q allelic status,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[951, 572, 593, 1113, 29, 226, 1337, 3861, 407, 15, 1803, 47, 85, 149, 765, 4, 445, 171, 163, 2, 32, 629, 1, 177, 2088, 11947, 1803, 1, 10529, 3692, 16, 186, 4, 393, 171, 8915, 2, 1969, 99, 29, 11947, 3262, 11947, 10529, 1803, 68, 40, 35, 306, 980, 1, 34, 228, 84, 3359, 4679, 5, 6602, 225, 1803, 75, 2910, 4, 957, 1554, 7989, 26, 596, 383, 38, 5412, 21, 1134, 897, 8, 18327, 572, 261, 90, 1156, 1451, 1260, 1329, 719, 6, 223, 3, 463, 15, 1127, 1, 11947, 1803, 1, 1170, 10529, 4, 86, 623, 3, 1312, 10, 157, 5332, 2, 938, 4, 8, 993, 1, 762, 171, 28094, 526, 31, 285, 20, 1196, 1155, 5, 1828, 6052, 2910, 4, 957, 1554, 482, 3288, 1155, 1, 1156, 1451, 1260, 1329, 2, 1591, 4, 957, 1554, 4, 327, 171, 86, 30, 347, 224, 8, 485, 1, 921, 2, 394, 1121, 9, 2502, 11947, 10529, 1803, 198, 8, 580, 10529, 1337, 207, 197, 1, 14, 27, 10, 95, 6, 1107, 11947, 1803, 57, 5, 1137, 14, 27, 11, 561, 41, 5, 393, 30, 3290, 404, 225, 22, 113, 34, 19, 488, 2, 30, 4068, 1073, 19, 2155, 46, 74, 309, 17, 1156, 1451, 1260, 1329, 3104, 1, 10529, 156, 16, 1313, 2, 561, 112, 4, 86, 30, 347, 485, 68, 40, 383, 408, 1, 3, 4943, 3082, 1, 110, 3, 1860, 2072, 2, 1144, 1, 476, 30, 347, 1633, 1162, 1156, 1451, 1260, 1329, 122, 40, 95, 22, 8, 64, 3643, 453, 1515, 9, 10529, 2152, 84, 8, 697, 1, 347, 68, 120, 1353, 1591, 4, 957, 1554, 65, 4, 35, 3448, 6, 14741, 223, 10529, 3861, 156]",1887.0,14681326,12
Radically different treatment recommendations for newly diagnosed neuroblastoma: pitfalls in assessment of risk.,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol.,2004-01-01,"Neuroblastoma risk stratification is based on stage, age, and biology and prescribes surgery for low-risk disease, moderate-dose chemotherapy for intermediate-risk disease, and maximal therapy (including myeloablative treatment with stem cell transplantation) for high-risk disease. Four cases are described that depict pitfalls in risk assessment with potentially far-reaching consequences. This report focuses on a subset of four patients referred for second opinions. Stage was defined by the International Neuroblastoma Staging System. The first recommendations were for maximal therapy, but second opinions were radically different (ie, surgery alone). Ages at diagnosis were 15 to 25 months. Shimada histopathology was unfavorable in three of the four patients, but chromosomal, serum, and urine prognostic markers were favorable. All four patients did well without cytotoxic therapy (follow-up: 2 years 10 months plus to 4 years 8 months plus). Patient 1 had abdominal and upper thoracic/supraclavicular masses (stage 4); the former was resected and the latter spontaneously regressed. Patient 2 had retroperitoneal disease, without bone marrow involvement, but imaging studies showed lesions in vertebral bodies. Biopsies of the latter showed no neuroblastoma and the primary tumor (with regional lymph nodes) was resected, changing stage from 4 to 2B. Patient 3 had a retroperitoneal mass but no distant disease. Though initially deemed to be unresectable, the abdominal tumor was excised, changing the classification from high risk (stage 3 with unfavorable histopathology) to low risk (stage 1). Patient 4 had a pelvic mass, with unfavorable histopathology, and bilateral inguinal lymph node involvement (stage 3); all soft tissue disease was resected. The absence of cortical bone and extensive bone marrow metastatic involvement in a young neuroblastoma patient should cause a shift in attention to biologic prognostic markers. Some patients classified as having high-risk neuroblastoma might actually do well with no cytotoxic therapy.",Case Reports,5864.0,11.0,risk stratification is based on stage age and biology and prescribes surgery for low-risk disease moderate-dose chemotherapy for intermediate-risk disease and maximal therapy including myeloablative treatment with stem cell transplantation for high-risk disease Four cases are described that depict pitfalls in risk assessment with potentially far-reaching consequences This report focuses on a subset of four patients referred for second opinions Stage was defined by the International Staging System The first recommendations were for maximal therapy but second opinions were radically different ie surgery alone Ages at diagnosis were 15 to 25 months Shimada histopathology was unfavorable in three of the four patients but chromosomal serum and urine prognostic markers were favorable All four patients did well without cytotoxic therapy follow-up 2 years 10 months plus to 4 years 8 months plus Patient 1 had abdominal and upper thoracic/supraclavicular masses stage 4 the former was resected and the latter spontaneously regressed Patient 2 had retroperitoneal disease without marrow involvement but imaging studies showed lesions in vertebral bodies Biopsies of the latter showed no and the primary tumor with regional lymph nodes was resected changing stage from 4 to 2B Patient 3 had a retroperitoneal mass but no distant disease Though initially deemed to be unresectable the abdominal tumor was excised changing the classification from high risk stage 3 with unfavorable histopathology to low risk stage 1 Patient 4 had a pelvic mass with unfavorable histopathology and bilateral inguinal lymph node involvement stage 3 all soft tissue disease was resected The absence of cortical and extensive marrow metastatic involvement in a young patient should cause a shift in attention to biologic prognostic markers Some patients classified as having high-risk might actually do well with no cytotoxic therapy,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[43, 1541, 16, 90, 23, 82, 89, 2, 891, 2, 53940, 152, 9, 154, 43, 34, 1163, 61, 56, 9, 919, 43, 34, 2, 2725, 36, 141, 3246, 24, 5, 452, 31, 497, 9, 64, 43, 34, 294, 140, 32, 1027, 17, 18944, 9631, 4, 43, 455, 5, 751, 3272, 6168, 3255, 26, 414, 3026, 23, 8, 697, 1, 294, 7, 1995, 9, 419, 7856, 82, 10, 395, 20, 3, 944, 632, 398, 3, 157, 883, 11, 9, 2725, 36, 84, 419, 7856, 11, 15604, 338, 2523, 152, 279, 2165, 28, 147, 11, 167, 6, 243, 53, 53941, 3831, 10, 2483, 4, 169, 1, 3, 294, 7, 84, 1860, 524, 2, 2646, 177, 525, 11, 913, 62, 294, 7, 205, 149, 187, 759, 36, 166, 126, 18, 60, 79, 53, 349, 6, 39, 60, 66, 53, 349, 69, 14, 42, 1467, 2, 1726, 2098, 5804, 2692, 82, 39, 3, 3623, 10, 1133, 2, 3, 3286, 6459, 12579, 69, 18, 42, 2591, 34, 187, 581, 799, 84, 270, 94, 224, 406, 4, 4731, 7442, 1154, 1, 3, 3286, 224, 77, 2, 3, 86, 30, 5, 951, 263, 502, 10, 1133, 3600, 82, 29, 39, 6, 3381, 69, 27, 42, 8, 2591, 782, 84, 77, 626, 34, 2471, 1625, 3779, 6, 40, 1468, 3, 1467, 30, 10, 5076, 3600, 3, 947, 29, 64, 43, 82, 27, 5, 2483, 3831, 6, 154, 43, 82, 14, 69, 39, 42, 8, 1110, 782, 5, 2483, 3831, 2, 1607, 4907, 263, 289, 799, 82, 27, 62, 1214, 246, 34, 10, 1133, 3, 1127, 1, 4500, 2, 1344, 581, 113, 799, 4, 8, 1169, 69, 257, 708, 8, 3024, 4, 2111, 6, 1283, 177, 525, 476, 7, 1373, 22, 1041, 64, 43, 822, 6742, 1022, 149, 5, 77, 759, 36]",1913.0,14707711,94
Camptothecin analogs (irinotecan or topotecan) plus high-dose cyclophosphamide as preparative regimens for antibody-based immunotherapy in resistant neuroblastoma.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2004-01-01,"We used high-dose cyclophosphamide plus topotecan/vincristine (CTV) or irinotecan (C/I) in patients with resistant neuroblastoma. The aim was to use a regimen with little risk to major organs to (a) achieve or consolidate remission in heavily treated patients and to (b) induce an immunological state conducive to passive immunotherapy with the murine 3F8 antibody. CTV and C/I included cyclophosphamide 140 mg/kg ( approximately 4200 mg/m(2)). With CTV, topotecan 2 mg/m(2) was infused i.v. (30 min) on days 1-4 (total, 8 mg/m(2)), and vincristine 0.067 mg/kg was injected on day 1. With C/I, irinotecan, 50 mg/m(2) was infused i.v. (1 h) on days 1-5 (total, 250 mg/m(2)). Mesna and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor were used. Twenty-nine patients received 38 courses of CTV, and 26 patients received 38 courses of C/I. All patients had previously received topotecan, a hemopoietic stem-cell transplant, and/or high-dose cyclophosphamide. CTV and C/I caused myelosuppression of comparably prolonged duration as follows: absolute neutrophil counts <500/ micro l lasted 5-12 days in patients who had not previously received transplant and 7-21 days in patients who were post-transplant. Other significant toxicities included typhlitis (two CTV-treated patients, one C/I-treated patient) and hemorrhagic cystitis (one C/I-treated patient). Major responses were seen in 4 (15%) of 26 CTV and 4 (17%) of 24 C/I-treated patients with assessable disease. Bone marrow disease resolved in 5 (28%) of 18 CTV-treated patients and in 4 (27%) of 15 C/I-treated patients. 3F8 after CTV or C/I was not blocked by neutralizing antibodies, consistent with the desired immunosuppressive effect of high-dose cyclophosphamide.

Treatment of spinal involvement in neuroblastoma patients.,Pediatric neurosurgery,Pediatr Neurosurg,2003-12-01,"Considerable controversy exists regarding the appropriate management of spinal involvement in neuroblastoma (NB) patients. We review a large group of such patients and offer treatment recommendations. Forty-six patients with epidural and/or neural foraminal involvement treated between 1987 and 1998 were staged according to the International NB Staging System (INSS) and classified as high-risk (INSS stage 4; n = 31) or low-risk (INSS stage <4; n = 15). Of 13 high- risk patients with normal neurologic examinations and no radiographic high-grade spinal cord compression (HGSCC), 12 were treated initially with chemotherapy, and only 1 demonstrated neurologic deterioration. HGSCC was present in 18 patients with high-risk NB; 7 of 10 (70%) treated initially with chemotherapy and 6 of 6 (100%) managed initially with operation improved or remained stable. All 9 low-risk patients with normal neurologic examinations and no HGSCC remained neurologically intact following operations (n = 7) or chemotherapy (n = 2). All 4 low-risk patients with HGSCC treated with operations improved or remained stable, and 0 of 2 (0%) low-risk patients treated initially with chemotherapy remained stable. Spinal deformities occurred in 2 of 16 patients (12.5%) treated nonoperatively and in 9 of 30 (30.0%) who underwent operations. High-risk NB patients with spinal involvement but normal neurologic examinations should be offered chemotherapy.

Restoration of promyelocytic leukemia protein-nuclear bodies in neuroblastoma cells enhances retinoic acid responsiveness.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2004-02-01,"Neuroblastoma is the most common solid tumor of infancy and is believed to result from impaired differentiation of neuronal crest embryonal cells.

During the course of studies to examine the composition and function of PML-nuclear bodies, we observed that the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y lacked these structures and that the absence of PML-nuclear bodies was a feature of N- and I-type, but not S-type, neuroblastoma cell lines. Induction of neuroblastoma cell differentiation with 5-bromo-2'deoxyuridine, all-trans-retinoic acid, or IFN-gamma induced PML-nuclear body formation.

Phase I trial of temozolomide and protracted irinotecan in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2004-02-01,"The purpose is to estimate the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of temozolomide and irinotecan given on a protracted schedule in 28-day courses to pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors. Twelve heavily pretreated patients received 56 courses of oral temozolomide at 100 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days combined with i.v. irinotecan given daily for 5 days for 2 consecutive weeks at either 10 mg/m(2)/day (n = 6) or 15 mg/m(2)/day (n = 6). We assessed toxicity, the pharmacokinetics of temozolomide and irinotecan, and the DNA repair phenotype in tumor samples. Two patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) at the higher dose level; one had grade 4 diarrhea, whereas the other had bacteremia with grade 2 neutropenia. In contrast, no patient receiving temozolomide and 10 mg/m(2)/day irinotecan experienced DLT. Myelosuppression was minimal and noncumulative. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed. Drug metabolite exposures at the MTD were similar to exposures previously associated with single-agent antitumor activity. One complete response, two partial responses, and one minor response were observed in Ewing's sarcoma and neuroblastoma patients previously treated with stem cell transplant. Responding patients had low or absent O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase expression in tumor tissue. The MTD using this schedule was temozolomide (100 mg/m(2)/day) and irinotecan (10 mg/m(2)/day), with DLT being diarrhea and infection. Drug clearance was similar to single-agent values, and clinically relevant SN-38 lactone and MTIC exposures were achieved at the MTD.

"In vitro and in vivo cytotoxic activities of recombinant immunotoxin 8H9(Fv)-PE38 against breast cancer, osteosarcoma, and neuroblastoma.",Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2004-02-01,"The 8H9 monoclonal antibody (MAb) is highly reactive with a cell surface glycoprotein expressed on human breast cancers, childhood sarcomas, and neuroblastomas but is not reactive with the cell surface of normal human tissues. This specific reactivity suggests that MAb 8H9 may be useful for targeted cancer therapy. To explore this possibility, we generated two recombinant immunotoxins (ITs) using the single-chain Fv (scFv) of MAb 8H9. Initially the 8H9(scFv) cDNA was fused to a DNA encoding a 38-kDa truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE38) to generate the IT 8H9(scFv)-PE38. The fusion gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the IT was purified to near homogeneity from inclusion bodies. The purified IT showed specific cytotoxicity on nine different cancer cell lines derived from breast cancer, osteosarcoma, and neuroblastomas, known to react with MAb 8H9. The cytotoxic activity was inhibited by MAb 8H9, showing the cytotoxic activity is specific. The antitumor activity of 8H9(scFv)-PE38 was evaluated in severe combined immunodeficient mice bearing MCF-7 breast cancers or OHS-M1 osteosarcomas. The IT showed a specific dose-dependent antitumor activity at 0.075 and 0.15 mg/kg. Next, a more stable disulfide-linked IT, 8H9(dsFv)-PE38, was constructed. It was produced in high yield (16%) and showed cytotoxic and antitumor activities similar to those of 8H9(scFv)-PE38. 8H9(dsFv)-PE38 was given to two cynomolgus monkeys at doses of 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg i.v. QOD x 3 and was well tolerated. This shows that a dose that causes significant tumor regressions in mice is well tolerated by monkeys. These results make 8H9(dsFv)-PE38 a candidate for further development as a therapeutic agent for breast cancers, osteosarcomas, and neuroblastomas.",Journal Article,5833.0,51.0,The 8H9 monoclonal antibody MAb is highly reactive with a cell surface glycoprotein expressed on human cancers childhood sarcomas and neuroblastomas but is not reactive with the cell surface of normal human tissues This specific reactivity suggests that MAb 8H9 may be useful for targeted cancer therapy To explore this possibility we generated two recombinant immunotoxins ITs using the single-chain Fv scFv of MAb 8H9 Initially the 8H9 scFv cDNA was fused to a DNA encoding a 38-kDa truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin PE38 to generate the IT 8H9 scFv -PE38 The fusion gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and the IT was purified to near homogeneity from inclusion bodies The purified IT showed specific cytotoxicity on nine different cancer cell lines derived from cancer and neuroblastomas known to react with MAb 8H9 The cytotoxic activity was inhibited by MAb 8H9 showing the cytotoxic activity is specific The antitumor activity of 8H9 scFv -PE38 was evaluated in severe combined immunodeficient mice bearing MCF-7 cancers or OHS-M1 osteosarcomas The IT showed a specific dose-dependent antitumor activity at 0.075 and 0.15 mg/kg Next a more stable disulfide-linked IT 8H9 dsFv -PE38 was constructed It was produced in high yield 16 and showed cytotoxic and antitumor activities similar to those of 8H9 scFv -PE38 8H9 dsFv -PE38 was given to two cynomolgus monkeys at doses of 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg i.v QOD x 3 and was well tolerated This shows that a dose that causes significant tumor regressions in mice is well tolerated by monkeys These results make 8H9 dsFv -PE38 a candidate for further development as a therapeutic agent for cancers osteosarcomas and neuroblastomas,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 9349, 848, 548, 2780, 16, 561, 2163, 5, 8, 31, 1255, 4455, 570, 23, 171, 163, 864, 1479, 2, 8915, 84, 16, 44, 2163, 5, 3, 31, 1255, 1, 295, 171, 742, 26, 112, 4601, 844, 17, 2780, 9349, 68, 40, 999, 9, 238, 12, 36, 6, 1645, 26, 2526, 21, 1419, 100, 2835, 17170, 211, 75, 3, 226, 1260, 15485, 7302, 1, 2780, 9349, 1625, 3, 9349, 7302, 4212, 10, 6263, 6, 8, 261, 2362, 8, 519, 6362, 6502, 1297, 1, 13538, 19522, 14141, 6, 2562, 3, 192, 9349, 7302, 14141, 3, 1212, 145, 10, 570, 4, 12832, 6959, 2, 3, 192, 10, 5963, 6, 1829, 7502, 29, 1680, 7442, 3, 5963, 192, 224, 112, 1408, 23, 762, 338, 12, 31, 285, 526, 29, 12, 2, 8915, 440, 6, 11651, 5, 2780, 9349, 3, 759, 128, 10, 879, 20, 2780, 9349, 2069, 3, 759, 128, 16, 112, 3, 579, 128, 1, 9349, 7302, 14141, 10, 194, 4, 905, 397, 5031, 399, 1894, 3252, 67, 163, 15, 54014, 4445, 11089, 3, 192, 224, 8, 112, 61, 470, 579, 128, 28, 13, 10800, 2, 13, 167, 81, 503, 1305, 8, 80, 585, 14454, 1199, 192, 9349, 21098, 14141, 10, 2776, 192, 10, 1687, 4, 64, 2309, 245, 2, 224, 759, 2, 579, 2042, 288, 6, 135, 1, 9349, 7302, 14141, 9349, 21098, 14141, 10, 447, 6, 100, 23307, 21220, 28, 415, 1, 13, 14, 2, 13, 18, 81, 503, 70, 603, 11479, 1006, 27, 2, 10, 149, 421, 26, 1949, 17, 8, 61, 17, 1626, 93, 30, 5142, 4, 399, 16, 149, 421, 20, 21220, 46, 99, 2378, 9349, 21098, 14141, 8, 1609, 9, 195, 193, 22, 8, 189, 420, 9, 163, 11089, 2, 8915]",1681.0,14973056,67
The impact of gross total resection on local control and survival in high-risk neuroblastoma.,Journal of pediatric surgery,J. Pediatr. Surg.,2004-03-01,"Gross total resection of the primary tumor in treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma remains controversial. Furthermore, there are few reports of the effect of primary tumor resection on local control as opposed to overall survival. The authors reviewed their institutional experience to assess the effect of primary tumor resection on local control and overall survival. A total of 141 patients were treated on protocol between November 1, 1979 and June 25, 2002 and are the subject of this report. Gross total resection was assessed by review of operative notes, postoperative computerized axial tomograms, and postoperative meta-iodobenzyl guanidine (MIBG)1 scans when available. The median age was 3.3 years, and all patients were International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS) stage 4 with 79% having metastases to cortical bone. The primary site was the adrenal gland in 74%, the central abdominal compartment in 13%, the posterior mediastinum in 7%, and other sites in 6%.

"Expression of neuropilin-1 in high-grade dysplasia, invasive cancer, and metastases of the human gastrointestinal tract.",The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2004-03-01,"Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) functions as an axonal guidance molecule in the developing nervous system, and recent work has identified NRP-1 up-regulation in several cancers, including neuroblastomas and breast carcinoma. We examined for the first time NRP-1 expression in a large variety of gastrointestinal carcinomas and precursor lesions to determine whether NRP-1 up-regulation correlated with invasive growth in this system. Protein expression and localization of NRP-1 were studied by immunolabeling and semiquantification in >300 dysplastic, invasive, and metastatic lesions of the gastrointestinal tract, and confirmation of NRP-1 protein expression was performed by Western blot analysis on pancreatic cancer cell lines. NRP-1 expression was limited within normal tissues of the gastrointestinal tract, with prominent labeling present only in endothelial cells, pancreatic islet cells, and the most apical colonic epithelium. Invasive cancer of the esophagus, gallbladder, ampulla of Vater, pancreas (endocrine and exocrine), and colon, however, all demonstrated striking NRP-1 expression. NRP-1 was also identified in precursor lesions of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, such as Barrett esophagus and colorectal adenomas. Within the spectrum of precursor lesions, a progressive increase in both intensity and area of expression was evident during histologic progression from low-grade to high-grade dysplasia. Notably, the most intense up-regulation of NRP-1 was apparent at or around the point of invasion, with focal expression of NRP-1 at levels equivalent to the invasive cancer (2- to 3-fold increase). Prominent labeling for NRP-1 was apparent in primary invasive cancers, liver metastases, and a subset of lymph node metastases, with a 2- to 3-fold increase of NRP-1 over dysplastic lesions. We conclude that increased expression of NRP-1 occurs in gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and in a subset of high-grade precursor lesions. This up-regulation appears to parallel invasive behavior and may therefore be used as a potential marker for cancer aggressiveness in this system.",Journal Article,5804.0,111.0,Neuropilin-1 NRP-1 functions as an axonal guidance molecule in the developing nervous system and recent work has identified NRP-1 up-regulation in several cancers including neuroblastomas and carcinoma We examined for the first time NRP-1 expression in a large variety of carcinomas and precursor lesions to determine whether NRP-1 up-regulation correlated with invasive growth in this system Protein expression and localization of NRP-1 were studied by immunolabeling and semiquantification in 300 dysplastic invasive and metastatic lesions of the tract and confirmation of NRP-1 protein expression was performed by Western blot analysis on cancer cell lines NRP-1 expression was limited within normal tissues of the tract with prominent labeling present only in endothelial cells islet cells and the most apical colonic epithelium Invasive cancer of the ampulla of Vater endocrine and exocrine and however all demonstrated striking NRP-1 expression NRP-1 was also identified in precursor lesions of adenocarcinomas such as Barrett and adenomas Within the spectrum of precursor lesions a progressive increase in both intensity and area of expression was evident during histologic progression from low-grade to high-grade dysplasia Notably the most intense up-regulation of NRP-1 was apparent at or around the point of invasion with focal expression of NRP-1 at levels equivalent to the invasive cancer 2- to 3-fold increase Prominent labeling for NRP-1 was apparent in primary invasive cancers metastases and a subset of lymph node metastases with a 2- to 3-fold increase of NRP-1 over dysplastic lesions We conclude that increased expression of NRP-1 occurs in adenocarcinomas and in a subset of high-grade precursor lesions This up-regulation appears to parallel invasive behavior and may therefore be used as a potential marker for cancer aggressiveness in this system,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[15253, 14, 11164, 14, 1681, 22, 35, 17257, 2753, 1354, 4, 3, 931, 1880, 398, 2, 435, 1357, 71, 108, 11164, 14, 126, 863, 4, 392, 163, 141, 8915, 2, 134, 21, 409, 9, 3, 157, 98, 11164, 14, 55, 4, 8, 375, 1362, 1, 826, 2, 2765, 406, 6, 223, 317, 11164, 14, 126, 863, 438, 5, 416, 129, 4, 26, 398, 178, 55, 2, 2145, 1, 11164, 14, 11, 656, 20, 21238, 2, 54129, 4, 2036, 6461, 416, 2, 113, 406, 1, 3, 1696, 2, 3551, 1, 11164, 14, 178, 55, 10, 173, 20, 1521, 2639, 65, 23, 12, 31, 285, 11164, 14, 55, 10, 383, 262, 295, 742, 1, 3, 1696, 5, 3689, 3383, 364, 158, 4, 845, 37, 7475, 37, 2, 3, 96, 9238, 3663, 2781, 416, 12, 1, 3, 12837, 1, 14777, 1293, 2, 12774, 2, 137, 62, 264, 5133, 11164, 14, 55, 11164, 14, 10, 120, 108, 4, 2765, 406, 1, 1586, 225, 22, 4366, 2, 2751, 262, 3, 1873, 1, 2765, 406, 8, 1014, 344, 4, 110, 837, 2, 965, 1, 55, 10, 2853, 190, 884, 91, 29, 154, 88, 6, 64, 88, 2253, 2552, 3, 96, 3933, 126, 863, 1, 11164, 14, 10, 2235, 28, 15, 3337, 3, 741, 1, 578, 5, 2137, 55, 1, 11164, 14, 28, 148, 2017, 6, 3, 416, 12, 18, 6, 27, 1116, 344, 3689, 3383, 9, 11164, 14, 10, 2235, 4, 86, 416, 163, 196, 2, 8, 697, 1, 263, 289, 196, 5, 8, 18, 6, 27, 1116, 344, 1, 11164, 14, 252, 6461, 406, 21, 2060, 17, 101, 55, 1, 11164, 14, 1780, 4, 1586, 2, 4, 8, 697, 1, 64, 88, 2765, 406, 26, 126, 863, 1233, 6, 2755, 416, 1710, 2, 68, 673, 40, 95, 22, 8, 174, 952, 9, 12, 3908, 4, 26, 398]",1872.0,15104297,111
Single-chain Fv-streptavidin substantially improved therapeutic index in multistep targeting directed at disialoganglioside GD2.,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",J. Nucl. Med.,2004-05-01,"Multistep targeting can improve the therapeutic index of antibody-based targeting, particularly relevant to pediatric tumors where acute toxicity and late effects of treatment are major concerns. Neuroblastoma is uniquely suited for such investigations because of its abundance of surface ganglioside GD2. 5F11scFv (scFv = single-chain variable fragment) was constructed from the variable regions of the heavy (V(H)) and kappa-light (V(L)) chain complementary DNA (cDNA) of anti-GD2 IgM hybridoma 5F11 and ligated to full-length streptavidin cDNA for expression in Escherichia coli. Purified 5F11-scFv-streptavidin (5F11-scFv-SA) was a homotetramer and showed comparable avidity to 5F11 IgM and a 30-fold improvement over monomeric scFv. Biodistribution of 5F11-scFv-SA was studied in nude mice xenografted with neuroblastoma LAN-1. Twenty-four hours after intravenous injection of 300-900 microg 5F11-scFv-SA, 150-450 microg of a thiogalactoside-containing clearing agent, (Gal-NAc)(16)-alpha-S-C(5)H(10)-NH-LC-N-Me-biotin (molecular weight, 8652), were administered intravenously, followed by approximately 2.5 microg (1.85-3.7 MBq) (111)In-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid-biotin ((111)In-DOTA-biotin) intravenously 4 h later and clocked as time 0. Tumor uptake (percentage of injected dose per gram [%ID/g]) at 2 h was 7 %ID/g and decayed with a half-life of 72 h, whereas blood %ID/g rapidly decreased to <1/500 of that of tumor after the first 24 h. The tumor-to-nontumor (T/NT) ratio at 72 h was high (median, 106; range, 3.4 [kidney] to 1660 [blood]). When the area under the radioactivity curve was computed, the T/NT organ ratio was favorable (4.8 for kidney and 162 for blood). When human and murine tumors were surveyed, the T/NT ratio of (111)In-DOTA-biotin uptake correlated with their levels of GD2 expression as assayed by flow cytometry. Biotinylated polypeptides (bovine serum albumin and vasointestinal peptides) achieved selective tumor targeting when the multistep strategy was applied.

Hematologic toxicity of high-dose iodine-131-metaiodobenzylguanidine therapy for advanced neuroblastoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2004-06-01,"Iodine-131-metaiodobenzylguanidine ((131)I-MIBG) has been shown to be active against refractory neuroblastoma. The primary toxicity of (131)I-MIBG is myelosuppression, which might necessitate autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (AHSCT). The goal of this study was to determine risk factors for myelosuppression and the need for AHSCT after (131)I-MIBG treatment. Fifty-three patients with refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma were treated with 18 mCi/kg (131)I-MIBG on a phase I/II protocol. The median whole-body radiation dose was 2.92 Gy. Almost all patients required at least one platelet (96%) or red cell (91%) transfusion and most patients (79%) developed neutropenia (< 0.5 x 10(3)/microL). Patients reached platelet nadir earlier than neutrophil nadir (P <.0001). Earlier platelet nadir correlated with bone marrow tumor, more extensive bone involvement, higher whole-body radiation dose, and longer time from diagnosis to (131)I-MIBG therapy (P <or=.04). In patients who did not require AHSCT, bone marrow disease predicted longer periods of neutropenia and platelet transfusion dependence (P <or=.03). Nineteen patients (36%) received AHSCT for prolonged myelosuppression. Of patients who received AHSCT, 100% recovered neutrophils, 73% recovered red cells, and 60% recovered platelets. Failure to recover red cells or platelets correlated with higher whole-body radiation dose (P <or=.04). These results demonstrate the substantial hematotoxicity associated with high-dose (131)I-MIBG therapy, with severe thrombocytopenia an early and nearly universal finding. Bone marrow tumor at time of treatment was the most useful predictor of hematotoxicity, whereas whole-body radiation dose was the most useful predictor of failure to recover platelets after AHSCT.",Clinical Trial,5712.0,76.0,Iodine-131-metaiodobenzylguanidine 131 I-MIBG has been shown to be active against refractory The primary toxicity of 131 I-MIBG is myelosuppression which might necessitate autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation AHSCT The goal of this study was to determine risk factors for myelosuppression and the need for AHSCT after 131 I-MIBG treatment Fifty-three patients with refractory or relapsed were treated with 18 mCi/kg 131 I-MIBG on a phase I/II protocol The median whole-body radiation dose was 2.92 Gy Almost all patients required at least one platelet 96 or red cell 91 transfusion and most patients 79 developed neutropenia 0.5 x 10 3 /microL Patients reached platelet nadir earlier than neutrophil nadir P .0001 Earlier platelet nadir correlated with marrow tumor more extensive involvement higher whole-body radiation dose and longer time from diagnosis to 131 I-MIBG therapy P or=.04 In patients who did not require AHSCT marrow disease predicted longer periods of neutropenia and platelet transfusion dependence P or=.03 Nineteen patients 36 received AHSCT for prolonged myelosuppression Of patients who received AHSCT 100 recovered neutrophils 73 recovered red cells and 60 recovered platelets Failure to recover red cells or platelets correlated with higher whole-body radiation dose P or=.04 These results demonstrate the substantial hematotoxicity associated with high-dose 131 I-MIBG therapy with severe thrombocytopenia an early and nearly universal finding marrow tumor at time of treatment was the most useful predictor of hematotoxicity whereas whole-body radiation dose was the most useful predictor of failure to recover platelets after AHSCT,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4287, 2229, 11285, 2229, 70, 3574, 71, 85, 443, 6, 40, 544, 480, 430, 3, 86, 155, 1, 2229, 70, 3574, 16, 2858, 92, 822, 12084, 1028, 1007, 452, 31, 497, 10587, 3, 1326, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 223, 43, 130, 9, 2858, 2, 3, 594, 9, 10587, 50, 2229, 70, 3574, 24, 1461, 169, 7, 5, 430, 15, 591, 11, 73, 5, 203, 4076, 503, 2229, 70, 3574, 23, 8, 124, 70, 215, 1182, 3, 52, 902, 642, 121, 61, 10, 18, 937, 381, 2214, 62, 7, 616, 28, 506, 104, 1596, 921, 15, 3422, 31, 970, 2785, 2, 96, 7, 842, 276, 778, 13, 33, 1006, 79, 27, 5128, 7, 1300, 1596, 3686, 1677, 76, 2595, 3686, 19, 488, 1677, 1596, 3686, 438, 5, 581, 30, 80, 1344, 799, 142, 902, 642, 121, 61, 2, 589, 98, 29, 147, 6, 2229, 70, 3574, 36, 19, 15, 755, 4, 7, 54, 205, 44, 1353, 10587, 581, 34, 783, 589, 3338, 1, 778, 2, 1596, 2785, 3721, 19, 15, 680, 3498, 7, 511, 103, 10587, 9, 1069, 2858, 1, 7, 54, 103, 10587, 394, 5784, 5700, 803, 5784, 3422, 37, 2, 335, 5784, 4407, 496, 6, 9966, 3422, 37, 15, 4407, 438, 5, 142, 902, 642, 121, 61, 19, 15, 755, 46, 99, 608, 3, 1281, 24721, 41, 5, 64, 61, 2229, 70, 3574, 36, 5, 905, 1340, 35, 191, 2, 1857, 4967, 1567, 581, 30, 28, 98, 1, 24, 10, 3, 96, 999, 980, 1, 24721, 547, 902, 642, 121, 61, 10, 3, 96, 999, 980, 1, 496, 6, 9966, 4407, 50, 10587]",1672.0,15197208,167

Neuroblastoma: a disease requiring a multitude of imaging studies.,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",J. Nucl. Med.,2004-07-01,"Neuroblastoma stands out among pediatric solid tumors because of its relative frequency, intriguing natural history, prognostic biologic features, and therapeutic challenges. It is the most common extracranial pediatric solid tumor and the most common neoplasm in infancy; >90% of the approximately 600 cases diagnosed annually in the United States are in children < or = 5 y old. Screening programs of infants show that many cases escape detection because of spontaneous regression or maturation into benign lesions. Origin from precursors of the sympathetic nervous system accounts for (a) primary sites in adrenal glands and in paraspinal locations from neck to pelvis and (b) high urinary levels of catecholamines in >90% of cases. This embryonal neoplasm often encases vascular structures and, unlike most solid cancers, usually presents with substantial metastatic disease (bone, bone marrow, lymph nodes, liver; spread to lung or brain is rare).

All had previously received chemotherapy, including intravenous etoposide in four patients, and all had received radiation therapy. Three patients (3 eyes) had vitreous seeds. Response was evaluated after one cycle. No serious acute toxicity was encountered, and no responses were noted. Four patients (5 eyes) had progressive disease. Stable disease was noted in one eye without vitreous disease. One patient developed secondary acute myeloid leukemia 30 months after exposure to oral etoposide.

Clustering of gene hypermethylation associated with clinical risk groups in neuroblastoma.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2004-08-01,"Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid malignancy in infancy and childhood, but the biological factors involved in its development and progression are still unclear. Transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes mediated by hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands is a hallmark of human tumors. We addressed the clinical relevance of promoter hypermethylation in neuroblastoma. We examined the methylation status of 45 candidate genes representative of many cellular pathways in 10 neuroblastoma cell lines and of 10 of these genes in 145 tumor samples (118 of them were primary neuroblastomas). We used Fisher's exact test to examine the association of CpG island methylation and clinical subgroups and Kaplan-Meier analysis to determine the association between methylation and survival in primary tumors. Cluster analysis was used to group cell lines and tumors by gene methylation status. Bonferroni-corrected statistical tests were two-sided. Clustering of neuroblastoma cell lines on the basis of hypermethylation distinguished lines with MYCN amplification (a negative prognostic factor) from those without it (P =.012). Promoter hypermethylation of the developmental gene HOXA9 was associated with mortality in noninfant patients (P =.04) and in tumors lacking MYCN amplification (P =.023). Hypermethylation of the proapoptotic gene TMS1 and the cell cycle gene CCND2 was associated with stage 4-progressing tumors (P<.001), but the genes were never methylated in stage 4S tumors, which undergo spontaneous regression. Hypermethylation of the differentiation gene RARbeta2 was associated with patient survival (P =.032). Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of all tumors based on methylation of the 10 genes separated several clinically relevant groups of tumors.

Morphologic and molecular characterization of renal cell carcinoma in children and young adults.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2004-09-01,"A new WHO classification of renal cell carcinoma has been introduced in 2004. This classification includes the recently described renal cell carcinomas with the ASPL-TFE3 gene fusion and carcinomas with a PRCC-TFE3 gene fusion. Collectively, these tumors have been termed Xp11.2 or TFE3 translocation carcinomas, which primarily occur in children and young adults. To further study the characteristics of renal cell carcinoma in young patients and to determine their genetic background, 41 renal cell carcinomas of patients younger than 22 years were morphologically and genetically characterized. Loss of heterozygosity analysis of the von Hippel-Lindau gene region and screening for VHL gene mutations by direct sequencing were performed in 20 tumors. TFE3 protein overexpression, which correlates with the presence of a TFE3 gene fusion, was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Applying the new WHO classification for renal cell carcinoma, there were 6 clear cell (15%), 9 papillary (22%), 2 chromophobe, and 2 collecting duct carcinomas. Eight carcinomas showed translocation carcinoma morphology (20%). One carcinoma occurred 4 years after a neuroblastoma. Thirteen tumors could not be assigned to types specified by the new WHO classification: 10 were grouped as unclassified (24%), including a unique renal cell carcinoma with prominently vacuolated cytoplasm and WT1 expression. Three carcinomas occurred in combination with nephroblastoma. Molecular analysis revealed deletions at 3p25-26 in one translocation carcinoma, one chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, and one papillary renal cell carcinoma. There were no VHL mutations. Nuclear TFE3 overexpression was detected in 6 renal cell carcinomas, all of which showed areas with voluminous cytoplasm and foci of papillary architecture, consistent with a translocation carcinoma phenotype. The large proportion of TFE3 ""translocation"" carcinomas and ""unclassified"" carcinomas in the first two decades of life demonstrates that renal cell carcinomas in young patients contain genetically and phenotypically distinct tumors with further potential for novel renal cell carcinoma subtypes.

Positional gene expression analysis identifies 12q overexpression and amplification in a subset of neuroblastomas.,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,Cancer Genet. Cytogenet.,2004-10-01,"Neuroblastoma is a heterogeneous disease with variable clinical behaviors. Unique molecular features are associated with clinically relevant subgroups. We performed a comprehensive microarray gene expression analysis of 95 neuroblastomas in an effort to define clinically important molecular subtypes. A subset of tumors overexpressed several contiguous genes located at 12q13 approximately q15 and were studied further. By microarray, 5 of 95 neuroblastomas had overexpression of genes mapped to 12q13.1 approximately q15, suggesting an amplification event in this region. Positional expression mapping identified the narrowest region of overlap containing 21 genes, with 11 genes overexpressed in all five cases. Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated 3 neuroblastomas with more than a 10-fold increase in 12q gene copies and 9 with 3- to 5-fold increases.

Radiographic assessment of resectability of locoregional disease in children with high-risk neuroblastoma during neoadjuvant chemotherapy.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2005-02-01,"The optimal timing for attempting removal of the primary tumor and regional disease in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma is uncertain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate resectability of the primary tumor and regional disease, as determined radiographically, in children with high-risk neuroblastoma during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients enrolled in our institutional high-risk neuroblastoma protocol were evaluated prospectively by CT scan and/or MRI to determine the resectability of their primary tumor and regional disease at diagnosis, after two cycles of experimental therapy and after standard induction therapy. Tumors were considered to be unresectable if there was significant involvement with major vascular structures or contiguous organs, or would likely require nephrectomy to remove the entire tumor. Twenty-four patients were referred prior to surgery for treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma. Seven of 24 (29%) patients were felt to be resectable at diagnosis, with an additional 9 patients becoming resectable after the initial experimental therapy. Thus, overall, 16 of 24 (67%) patients were felt to be resectable by the completion of the initial therapy. Only four additional patients of the remaining eight were considered resectable after the completion of standard induction therapy. Based on these data, we conclude that complete resection of the primary tumor and regional disease in children with high-risk neuroblastoma can be performed after an initial phase therapy in the majority of patients. Since earlier tumor removal may decrease the chance for the subsequent development of chemotherapy-resistant disease, we are recommending surgical resection as soon as the locoregional disease appears to be resectable.",Journal Article,5467.0,12.0,The optimal timing for attempting removal of the primary tumor and regional disease in patients with high-risk is uncertain The purpose of this study was to evaluate resectability of the primary tumor and regional disease as determined radiographically in children with high-risk during neoadjuvant chemotherapy Patients enrolled in our institutional high-risk protocol were evaluated prospectively by CT scan and/or MRI to determine the resectability of their primary tumor and regional disease at diagnosis after two cycles of experimental therapy and after standard induction therapy Tumors were considered to be unresectable if there was significant involvement with major vascular structures or contiguous organs or would likely require nephrectomy to remove the entire tumor Twenty-four patients were referred prior to surgery for treatment of high-risk Seven of 24 29 patients were felt to be resectable at diagnosis with an additional 9 patients becoming resectable after the initial experimental therapy Thus overall 16 of 24 67 patients were felt to be resectable by the completion of the initial therapy Only four additional patients of the remaining eight were considered resectable after the completion of standard induction therapy Based on these data we conclude that complete resection of the primary tumor and regional disease in children with high-risk can be performed after an initial phase therapy in the majority of patients Since earlier tumor removal may decrease the chance for the subsequent development of chemotherapy-resistant disease we are recommending surgical resection as soon as the locoregional disease appears to be resectable,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 665, 1972, 9, 9632, 2829, 1, 3, 86, 30, 2, 951, 34, 4, 7, 5, 64, 43, 16, 2717, 3, 743, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 376, 5150, 1, 3, 86, 30, 2, 951, 34, 22, 509, 5770, 4, 541, 5, 64, 43, 190, 536, 56, 7, 346, 4, 114, 1115, 64, 43, 1182, 11, 194, 1143, 20, 425, 1657, 2, 15, 704, 6, 223, 3, 5150, 1, 136, 86, 30, 2, 951, 34, 28, 147, 50, 100, 410, 1, 1560, 36, 2, 50, 260, 504, 36, 57, 11, 515, 6, 40, 1468, 492, 125, 10, 93, 799, 5, 458, 756, 2414, 15, 10941, 2285, 15, 688, 322, 1353, 1738, 6, 7930, 3, 1797, 30, 737, 294, 7, 11, 1995, 324, 6, 152, 9, 24, 1, 64, 43, 648, 1, 259, 462, 7, 11, 5284, 6, 40, 1899, 28, 147, 5, 35, 402, 83, 7, 4009, 1899, 50, 3, 388, 1560, 36, 631, 63, 245, 1, 259, 598, 7, 11, 5284, 6, 40, 1899, 20, 3, 1438, 1, 3, 388, 36, 158, 294, 402, 7, 1, 3, 1844, 659, 11, 515, 1899, 50, 3, 1438, 1, 260, 504, 36, 90, 23, 46, 74, 21, 2060, 17, 236, 170, 1, 3, 86, 30, 2, 951, 34, 4, 541, 5, 64, 43, 122, 40, 173, 50, 35, 388, 124, 36, 4, 3, 686, 1, 7, 1192, 1677, 30, 2829, 68, 775, 3, 3477, 9, 3, 706, 193, 1, 56, 436, 34, 21, 32, 9040, 221, 170, 22, 6176, 22, 3, 1325, 34, 1233, 6, 40, 1899]",1663.0,15481078,64
Measuring circulating neuroblastoma cells by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis.,Cancer,Cancer,2004-11-01,"Histologic examination of bone marrow (BM) is an accepted clinical standard for the detection of metastatic neuroblastoma (NB). Circulating tumor cells in peripheral blood (PB) derive from depots other than BM, and its measurement may provide additional information in the management of patients with NB. One hundred twenty patients with Stage 4 NB were evaluated for tumor cell content in PB by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis of GD2 synthase mRNA with a sensitivity of 1 NB cell in 10(6) normal cells. These findings were correlated with qRT-PCR analysis of their simultaneously sampled BM aspirates and 5 standard modalities of disease detection (histology, computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, bone scan, metaiodobenzylguanidine scan, and urinary homovanillic acid/vanillylmandelic acid levels). Detection of GD2 synthase transcript was found in 62 patients: Eleven patients had positive (+) samples in their BM and PB (BM+PB+), 38 patients had BM+PB-negative (BM+PB-) specimens, and 13 patients had BM-PB+ samples. BM+PB+ paired samples had the highest transcript levels. When the extent of disease was scored (from 0 to 5) according to the number of positive disease detection modalities, the magnitude of the transcript level correlated with disease score. Ninety-one percent of patients with BM+PB+ samples had evidence of disease in >/= 3 modalities, whereas 97% of patients with BM-PB- samples and 100% of patients with BM-PB+ samples had low disease scores </= 2. Marker positivity in BM correlated with disease score. Patients who had positive marker in BM or PB had higher rates of relapse and death compared with patients who had negative marker. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a significantly greater risk of death for patients who had BM+PB+ specimens compared with patients who had BM-PB- samples (P = 0.03).

Activating mutations of the noonan syndrome-associated SHP2/PTPN11 gene in human solid tumors and adult acute myelogenous leukemia.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2004-12-01,"The SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPN11 (Shp2) is required for normal development and is an essential component of signaling pathways initiated by growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix. In many of these pathways, Shp2 acts upstream of Ras. About 50% of patients with Noonan syndrome have germ-line PTPN11 gain of function mutations. Associations between Noonan syndrome and an increased risk of some malignancies, notably leukemia and neuroblastoma, have been reported, and recent data indicate that somatic PTPN11 mutations occur in children with sporadic juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, myelodysplasic syndrome, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia patients without PTPN11 mutations have either homozygotic NF-1 deletion or activating RAS mutations. Given the role of Shp2 in Ras activation and the frequent mutation of RAS in human tumors, these data raise the possibility that PTPN11 mutations play a broader role in cancer. We asked whether PTPN11 mutations occur in other malignancies in which activating RAS mutations occur at low but significant frequency. Sequencing of PTPN11 from 13 different human neoplasms including breast, lung, gastric, and neuroblastoma tumors and adult AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia revealed 11 missense mutations. Five are known mutations predicted to result in an activated form of Shp2, whereas six are new mutations. Biochemical analysis confirmed that several of the new mutations result in increased Shp2 activity. Our data demonstrate that mutations in PTPN11 occur at low frequency in several human cancers, especially neuroblastoma and AML, and suggest that Shp2 may be a novel target for antineoplastic therapy.",Journal Article,5529.0,336.0,The SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPN11 Shp2 is required for normal development and is an essential component of signaling pathways initiated by growth factors cytokines and extracellular matrix In many of these pathways Shp2 acts upstream of Ras About 50 of patients with Noonan syndrome have germ-line PTPN11 gain of function mutations Associations between Noonan syndrome and an increased risk of some malignancies notably and have been reported and recent data indicate that somatic PTPN11 mutations occur in children with sporadic juvenile myelomonocytic myelodysplasic syndrome B-cell acute lymphoblastic and acute myelogenous AML Juvenile myelomonocytic patients without PTPN11 mutations have either homozygotic NF-1 deletion or activating RAS mutations Given the role of Shp2 in Ras activation and the frequent mutation of RAS in human tumors these data raise the possibility that PTPN11 mutations play a broader role in cancer We asked whether PTPN11 mutations occur in other malignancies in which activating RAS mutations occur at low but significant frequency Sequencing of PTPN11 from 13 different human neoplasms including and tumors and adult AML and acute lymphoblastic revealed 11 missense mutations Five are known mutations predicted to result in an activated form of Shp2 whereas six are new mutations Biochemical analysis confirmed that several of the new mutations result in increased Shp2 activity Our data demonstrate that mutations in PTPN11 occur at low frequency in several human cancers especially and AML and suggest that Shp2 may be a novel target for antineoplastic therapy,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 16745, 1398, 1101, 178, 564, 2577, 8403, 15508, 16, 616, 9, 295, 193, 2, 16, 35, 1452, 1249, 1, 314, 460, 1917, 20, 129, 130, 1886, 2, 1976, 2248, 4, 445, 1, 46, 460, 15508, 4459, 3988, 1, 1102, 545, 212, 1, 7, 5, 26240, 681, 47, 2280, 328, 8403, 1803, 1, 343, 138, 685, 59, 26240, 681, 2, 35, 101, 43, 1, 476, 441, 2552, 2, 47, 85, 210, 2, 435, 74, 1008, 17, 1119, 8403, 138, 1271, 4, 541, 5, 1928, 7857, 5451, 43807, 681, 132, 31, 286, 1275, 2, 286, 2194, 329, 7857, 5451, 7, 187, 8403, 138, 47, 361, 43808, 1365, 14, 1528, 15, 1616, 1102, 138, 447, 3, 200, 1, 15508, 4, 1102, 363, 2, 3, 908, 258, 1, 1102, 4, 171, 57, 46, 74, 5008, 3, 2526, 17, 8403, 138, 1343, 8, 5410, 200, 4, 12, 21, 3732, 317, 8403, 138, 1271, 4, 127, 441, 4, 92, 1616, 1102, 138, 1271, 28, 154, 84, 93, 675, 615, 1, 8403, 29, 233, 338, 171, 1179, 141, 2, 57, 2, 780, 329, 2, 286, 1275, 553, 175, 4007, 138, 365, 32, 440, 138, 783, 6, 757, 4, 35, 735, 1297, 1, 15508, 547, 437, 32, 217, 138, 1487, 65, 557, 17, 392, 1, 3, 217, 138, 757, 4, 101, 15508, 128, 114, 74, 608, 17, 138, 4, 8403, 1271, 28, 154, 675, 4, 392, 171, 163, 1093, 2, 329, 2, 309, 17, 15508, 68, 40, 8, 229, 283, 9, 3940, 36]",1624.0,15604238,27
Reduction from seven to five cycles of intensive induction chemotherapy in children with high-risk neuroblastoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2004-12-01,"We previously reported a high response rate with a dose-intensive chemotherapy regimen in 24 children with high-risk neuroblastoma (NB). We now describe similar results with changes that reduce toxicity (fewer cycles, less vincristine, use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor). Eighty-seven consecutive newly diagnosed children with high-risk NB underwent induction that initially had seven cycles (57 patients) but was later limited to five (30 patients). Cycles 1, 2, 4, and 6 used cyclophosphamide (140 mg/kg)/doxorubicin (75 mg/m(2))/vincristine (0.15 mg/kg in the first 27 patients, 0.067 mg/kg subsequently). Cycles 3, 5, and 7 used cisplatin (200 mg/m(2))/etoposide (600 mg/m(2)). Tumor resection followed a minimum of three cycles. The induction was eventually modified to include anti-G(D2) immunotherapy after each of the last three cycles (38 patients). Bone marrow disease resolved in 70 (91%) of 77 patients and was not detected pre- and postinduction in 10 patients. After cycle 3 or 4, 86% of primary tumors were more than 50% smaller. Postinduction metaiodobenzylguanidine scans showed normal radiotracer distribution in metastatic sites in 74 (87%) of 85 patients. Overall results were: 68 (79%) complete/very good partial responses (CR/VGPR); 14 (16%) partial responses (PR); three (3%) less than PR; one (1%) death from infection; and one patient not assessable for response. Five cycles yielded a CR/VGPR rate of 83%, compared with a 77% rate from seven cycles. Side effects were myelosuppression, mucositis, and hearing deficits; neurotoxicity was insignificant with the lower vincristine dosage. Four patients (each received seven cycles) developed myelodysplasia/leukemia.

Five-day courses of irinotecan as palliative therapy for patients with neuroblastoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2005-02-01,"The authors describe a large experience using short courses of irinotecan for palliative therapy in patients with neuroblastoma (NB). Quality of life was a major issue in choosing this regimen for patients whose disease was resistant to standard anti-NB therapies. A retrospective review was conducted of all patients who were followed by the Department of Pediatrics at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and treated for resistant NB with irinotecan at 50 mg/m2 per day for 5 days as a 1-hour intravenous infusion. Treatment was outpatient, and there was a minimum 2-week rest period between courses. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was used to keep the absolute neutrophil count >500-1000/mL. Forty-four patients had been treated aggressively and/or extensively before they received one or more five-day courses of irinotecan. Emetogenic, diarrheal, and myelosuppressive effects were readily managed. Hospitalizations were limited to three patients with bacteremia. Twenty-three patients had a change in therapy, although they did not have progressive disease (PD) after receiving 1 (n=10), 2 (n=3), 3 (n=1), 4 (n=6), 7 (n=1 patient), 22 (n=1 patient), or 24 (n=1) courses. The most common reasons for changing treatment were to intensify retrieval therapy or to pursue immunotherapy.

"Allelic losses at 1p36 and 19q13 in gliomas: correlation with histologic classification, definition of a 150-kb minimal deleted region on 1p36, and evaluation of CAMTA1 as a candidate tumor suppressor gene.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2005-02-01,"Allelic loss at 1p is seen in 70% to 85% of oligodendrogliomas (typically in association with 19q allelic loss) and 20-30% of astrocytomas. Because most 1p deletions in gliomas involve almost the entire chromosome arm, narrowing the region of the putative tumor suppressor gene has been difficult. To better define the histologic correlates of different patterns of 1p and 19q loss, we evaluated 1p/19q status in a large group of gliomas. This also allowed us to define a very small minimal deleted region (MDR) on 1p36. Among 205 consecutive cases of glioma studied for 1p loss of heterozygosity (LOH), 112 tumors were evaluated for both 1p and 19q LOH using at least three polymorphic markers on 1p and 19q each. The latter group included both low-grade tumors (oligodendroglioma, diffuse astrocytoma, and ""oligoastrocytoma"") and high-grade tumors (anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, anaplastic astrocytomas, anaplastic oligoastrocytomas). Tumors with small segmental 1p losses (defined as LOH at some loci with retention of heterozygosity at other loci) were studied using a more extensive panel of markers to define the 1p MDR. The candidate gene was screened for mutations and its expression was studied by qualitative and quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR and Northern blotting. Allelic losses on 1p and 19q, either separately or combined, were more common in classic oligodendrogliomas than in either astrocytomas or oligoastrocytomas (P < 0.0001). Classic oligodendrogliomas showed 1p loss in 35 of 42 (83%) cases, 19q loss in 28 of 39 (72%), and these were combined in 27 of 39 (69%) cases. There was no significant difference in 1p/19q LOH status between low-grade and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. In contrast, no astrocytomas and only 6 of 30 (20%) oligoastrocytic tumors had combined 1p/19q loss. Although rare, 1p deletions were more often segmental in astrocytomas (5 of 6, 83%) than in oligodendrogliomas (3 of 35, 9%; P = 0.006). Eleven tumors (6 oligodendrogliomas or having oligodendroglial components, 5 purely astrocytic) with small segmental 1p losses underwent further detailed LOH mapping. All informative tumors in the oligodendroglial group and 2 of 3 informative astrocytomas showed LOH at 1p36.23, with a 150-kb MDR located between D1S2694 and D1S2666, entirely within the CAMTA1 transcription factor gene. Mutation analysis of the exons encoding conserved regions of CAMTA1 showed no somatic mutations in 10 gliomas, including 6 cases with and 4 cases without 1p LOH. CAMTA1 is normally expressed predominantly in non-neoplastic adult brain tissue. Relative to the latter, the expression level of CAMTA1 was low in oligodendroglial tumors and was further halved in cases with 1p deletion compared with those without 1p deletion (Mann-Whitney, P = 0.03). Our data confirm the strong association of combined 1p/19q loss with classic oligodendroglioma histology and identify a very small segment of 1p36 located within CAMTA1 that was deleted in all oligodendroglial tumors with 1p LOH. This MDR also overlaps the neuroblastoma 1p36 MDR. CAMTA1 shows no evidence of inactivation by somatic mutations but its expression is reduced by half in cases with 1p LOH, suggesting that the functional effects of CAMTA1 haploinsufficiency warrant further investigation.",Comparative Study,5467.0,142.0,Allelic loss at 1p is seen in 70 to 85 of oligodendrogliomas typically in association with 19q allelic loss and 20-30 of astrocytomas Because most 1p deletions in gliomas involve almost the entire chromosome arm narrowing the region of the putative tumor suppressor gene has been difficult To better define the histologic correlates of different patterns of 1p and 19q loss we evaluated 1p/19q status in a large group of gliomas This also allowed us to define a very small minimal deleted region MDR on 1p36 Among 205 consecutive cases of glioma studied for 1p loss of heterozygosity LOH 112 tumors were evaluated for both 1p and 19q LOH using at least three polymorphic markers on 1p and 19q each The latter group included both low-grade tumors oligodendroglioma diffuse astrocytoma and `` oligoastrocytoma '' and high-grade tumors anaplastic oligodendrogliomas anaplastic astrocytomas anaplastic oligoastrocytomas Tumors with small segmental 1p losses defined as LOH at some loci with retention of heterozygosity at other loci were studied using a more extensive panel of markers to define the 1p MDR The candidate gene was

Long-term complications in survivors of advanced stage neuroblastoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2005-09-01,"Few studies have assessed late effects in neuroblastoma (NB) survivors, particularly those with advanced stage disease. Retrospective analysis of a cohort of advanced stage NB survivors followed in a late effect clinic at a single institution. Screening tests to detect late effects were tailored depending on the individual's treatment exposures. The study included 63 survivors (31 males). The median age at diagnosis was 3.0 years. The median follow-up from diagnosis was 7.06 years. All patients had surgery and received chemotherapy, 89% received radiation therapy (RT), 62% immunotherapy, and 56% autologous stem cell transplant. Late complications were detected in 95% of survivors and included: hearing loss (62%), primary hypothyroidism (24%), ovarian failure (41% of females), musculoskeletal (19%), and pulmonary (19%) abnormalities. The majority of complications were moderate, with only 4% being life-threatening. Survivors who received cisplatin were at greater risk to develop hearing loss compared to those not so treated (OR 9.74; 95% CI: 0.9-101.6).

Characteristics of stem cells from human neuroblastoma cell lines and in tumors.,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",Neoplasia,,"Cellular heterogeneity is a hallmark of human neuroblastoma tumors and cell lines. Within a single neuroblastoma are cells from distinct neural crest lineages whose relative abundance is significant for prognosis. We postulate that a self-renewing multipotent tumor stem cell, which gives rise to diverse cell lineages, is the malignant progenitor of this cancer. To test this hypothesis, we have established 22 cloned, phenotypically homogeneous populations of the three major cell types from 17 neuroblastoma cell lines. In vitro, malignant neuroblastoma stem cells, termed I-type (intermediate type), have distinct morphologic, biochemical, differentiative, and tumorigenic properties. I-type cells express features of both neuroblastic (N) cells (scant cytoplasm, neuritic processes, neurofilaments, pseudoganglia, and granin and neurotransmitter enzyme expression) and substrate-adherent (S) cells (extensive cytoplasm and vimentin and CD44 expression). Moreover, they show bidirectional differentiation to either N or S cells when induced by specific agents. I-type cells are significantly more malignant than N- or S-type cells, with four- to five-fold greater plating efficiencies in soft agar and six-fold higher tumorigenicity in athymic mice. Differences in malignant potential are unrelated to N-myc amplification/overexpression or the ability to digest and migrate through the extracellular matrix. Immunocytochemical analyses of a small series of tumors reveal that frequency of cells coexpressing N and S cell markers correlates with poor prognosis. Thus, I-type stem cells may be instrumental in the genesis and growth of tumors in the patient.

The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) is a multicenter cohort study of >/= 5-year survivors of pediatric cancer diagnosed between 1970 and 1986. Self-reported heights and weights were used to calculate BMI for 7195 adult survivors, compared with population-based, age-specific, and gender-specific norms from the 1995 National Health Interview Survey.

"EMP3, a myelin-related gene located in the critical 19q13.3 region, is epigenetically silenced and exhibits features of a candidate tumor suppressor in glioma and neuroblastoma.",Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2005-04-01,"The presence of common genomic deletions in the 19q13 chromosomal region in neuroblastomas and gliomas strongly suggests the presence of a putative tumor suppressor gene for these neoplasms in this region that, despite much effort, has not yet been identified. In an attempt to address this issue, we compared the expression profile of 89 neuroblastoma tumors with that of benign ganglioneuromas by microarray analysis. Probe sets (637 of 62,839) were significantly down-regulated in neuroblastoma tumors, including, most importantly, a gene located at 19q13.3: the epithelial membrane protein 3 (EMP3), a myelin-related gene involved in cell proliferation and cell-cell interactions. We found that EMP3 undergoes hypermethylation-mediated transcriptional silencing in neuroblastoma and glioma cancer cell lines, whereas the use of the demethylating agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine restores EMP3 gene expression. Furthermore, the reintroduction of EMP3 into neuroblastoma cell lines displaying methylation-dependent silencing of EMP3 induces tumor suppressor-like features, such as reduced colony formation density and tumor growth in nude mouse xenograft models. Screening a large collection of human primary neuroblastomas (n = 116) and gliomas (n = 41), we observed that EMP3 CpG island hypermethylation was present in 24% and 39% of these tumor types, respectively. Furthermore, the detection of EMP3 hypermethylation in neuroblastoma could be clinically relevant because it was associated with poor survival after the first 2 years of onset of the disease (Kaplan-Meier; P = 0.03) and death of disease (Kendall tau, P = 0.03; r = 0.19).

We now show that the combination of A-357300 with cyclophosphamide at the maximal tolerated dose sustained tumor regression with a T/C at day 48 of 0.16 (P < 0.001) in the CHP-134 xenograft model.

Lastly, A-357300 caused regression of established tumors in a genetically engineered murine model with progression-free survival in five of eight mice (P < 0.0001). There was no evidence of toxicity.

Prospects for therapeutic inhibition of neuroblastoma angiogenesis.,Cancer letters,Cancer Lett.,2005-10-01,"Despite aggressive therapy, survival for advanced stage neuroblastoma remains poor with significant long-term morbidity in disease survivors. High-risk disease features are strongly correlated with tumor vascularity, suggesting that angiogenesis inhibitors may be a useful addition to current therapeutic strategies. However, challenges include the well-known clinical heterogeneity and embryonal origins of this disease, which suggests a complex regulation of neovascularization that may be distinct from epithelial-derived carcinomas. We will review what is understood about angiogenesis-related signaling in neuroblastoma. In particular, we will present evidence that angiogenesis-related molecules are differentially expressed in primary neuroblastomas in a pattern suggesting promotion of a pro-angiogenic phenotype in high-risk tumors and an anti-angiogenic phenotype in low-risk tumors.

Aberrations of the CHK2 gene are rare in pediatric solid tumors.,International journal of molecular medicine,Int. J. Mol. Med.,2005-07-01,"In pediatric solid tumors, such as neuroblastoma (NB), it has been reported that the frequency of TP53 gene alterations is lower than that in adult tumors, suggesting that other tumor suppressor genes may play more important roles in the development of pediatric solid tumors. The CHK2 gene, whose product is a checkpoint kinase that plays a central role in DNA damage response and acts upstream of TP53, has been found to be mutated in a subset of Li-Fraumeni syndrome without mutations of TP53 and in some other sporadic human tumors, earmarking this serine/threonine kinase as a candidate tumor suppressor gene. Thus, we analyzed the CHK2 gene to address whether it is a candidate tumor suppressor gene for pediatric solid tumors. We screened for mutations of the CHK2 gene in 25 NB, 8 rhbdomyosarcoma, 12 Ewing sarcoma, and 26 other pediatric solid tumor cell lines as well as 77 fresh tumors including two cases of multiple cancers. Using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis and reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR-SSCP followed by direct sequence analysis, we detected only one missense mutation (S505T) in one NB cell line and two silent mutations in one NB cell line and one NB fresh tumor, respectively. Through RT-PCR and subcloning analysis, we detected a similar expression of the CHK2 gene in all of the NB cell lines and fresh tumors; however, we identified at least three isoforms of the CHK2 gene, two of which have not been reported previously.

Phase I study of the combination of topotecan and irinotecan in children with refractory solid tumors.,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol.,2005-11-05,"We have shown in xenograft studies that the antitumor activities of topotecan and irinotecan are highly schedule- and dose-dependent, with a high frequency of response at low, protracted dose schedules. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that topotecan and irinotecan have different antitumor activities and mechanisms of resistance, and non-overlapping toxicities, providing a rationale for their combination. Combining both agents may increase the amount of camptothecin delivered to the tumor, without additive toxicity. We conducted a phase I study in children with refractory solid tumors to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of irinotecan when administered with a targeted systemic exposure (TSE) of topotecan and to define the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of this combination. Irinotecan was administered IV over 60 min followed by topotecan over 30 min daily for 5 days for two consecutive weeks. We initially fixed the topotecan-TSE to 80+/-10 ng*h/ml and investigated the ability to escalate irinotecan (starting dose 16 mg/m2/d). Topotecan and irinotecan pharmacokinetics were determined. Eleven patients (median age 10 years) were enrolled. Owing to DLT, irinotecan was de-escalated to 12 (level -1; n = 3) and 9 (level -2; n = 3) mg/m2/day, and topotecan-TSE was reduced to 60+/-10 ng*h/ml (level -3; n = 2). DLTs were neutropenia (n = 8), typhlitis (n = 5), and skin rash (n = 1). MTD could not be reached. Median (range) irinotecan and topotecan lactone systemic clearances were 50.3 (16.6-76.2) l/h/m2 and 27.6 (14.7-55.9) l/h/m2, respectively. The pharmacokinetics profile of each agent was similar to that seen in previous single agent studies. One patient with neuroblastoma and one with rhabdomyosarcoma had a partial and a complete response, respectively. Despite promising antitumor activity, the combination of topotecan and irinotecan given on a protracted schedule does not warrant further development in children due to unacceptable toxicity.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",5190.0,13.0,We have shown in xenograft studies that the antitumor activities of topotecan and irinotecan are highly schedule- and dose-dependent with a high frequency of response at low protracted dose schedules Preclinical and clinical data suggest that topotecan and irinotecan have different antitumor activities and mechanisms of resistance and non-overlapping toxicities providing a rationale for their combination Combining both agents may increase the amount of camptothecin delivered to the tumor without additive toxicity We conducted a phase I study in children with refractory solid tumors to determine the maximum tolerated dose MTD of irinotecan when administered with a targeted systemic exposure TSE of topotecan and to define the dose-limiting toxicity DLT of this combination Irinotecan was administered IV over 60 min followed by topotecan over 30 min daily for 5 days for two consecutive weeks We initially fixed the topotecan-TSE to 80+/-10 ng*h/ml and investigated the ability to escalate irinotecan starting dose 16 mg/m2/d Topotecan and irinotecan pharmacokinetics were determined Eleven patients median age 10 years were enrolled Owing to DLT irinotecan was de-escalated to 12 level -1 n 3 and 9 level -2 n 3 mg/m2/day and topotecan-TSE was reduced to 60+/-10 ng*h/ml level -3 n 2 DLTs were neutropenia n 8 typhlitis n 5 and rash n 1 MTD could not be reached Median range irinotecan and topotecan lactone systemic clearances were 50.3 16.6-76.2 l/h/m2 and 27.6 14.7-55.9 l/h/m2 respectively The pharmacokinetics profile of each agent was similar to that seen in previous single agent studies One patient with and one with had a partial and a complete response respectively Despite promising antitumor activity the combination of topotecan and irinotecan given on a protracted schedule does not warrant further development in children due to unacceptable toxicity,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 47, 443, 4, 1330, 94, 17, 3, 579, 2042, 1, 2129, 2, 1071, 32, 561, 1055, 2, 61, 470, 5, 8, 64, 675, 1, 51, 28, 154, 7053, 61, 2314, 693, 2, 38, 74, 309, 17, 2129, 2, 1071, 47, 338, 579, 2042, 2, 483, 1, 251, 2, 220, 4551, 385, 1736, 8, 1728, 9, 136, 150, 1525, 110, 183, 68, 344, 3, 3108, 1, 6968, 1623, 6, 3, 30, 187, 3396, 155, 21, 426, 8, 124, 70, 45, 4, 541, 5, 430, 537, 57, 6, 223, 3, 689, 421, 61, 961, 1, 1071, 198, 468, 5, 8, 238, 403, 645, 26259, 1, 2129, 2, 6, 1107, 3, 61, 817, 155, 2059, 1, 26, 150, 1071, 10, 468, 478, 252, 335, 1538, 370, 20, 2129, 252, 201, 1538, 391, 9, 33, 162, 9, 100, 935, 244, 21, 1625, 1959, 3, 2129, 26259, 6, 493, 79, 997, 555, 542, 2, 565, 3, 801, 6, 10400, 1071, 1723, 61, 245, 81, 821, 427, 2129, 2, 1071, 1159, 11, 509, 2627, 7, 52, 89, 79, 60, 11, 346, 3421, 6, 2059, 1071, 10, 1566, 2842, 6, 133, 301, 14, 78, 27, 2, 83, 301, 18, 78, 27, 81, 821, 218, 2, 2129, 26259, 10, 405, 6, 335, 79, 997, 555, 542, 301, 27, 78, 18, 2506, 11, 778, 78, 66, 12710, 78, 33, 2, 1641, 78, 14, 961, 359, 44, 40, 1300, 52, 184, 1071, 2, 2129, 8643, 403, 20228, 11, 212, 27, 245, 49, 846, 18, 805, 555, 821, 2, 428, 49, 213, 67, 614, 83, 805, 555, 821, 106, 3, 1159, 800, 1, 296, 420, 10, 288, 6, 17, 527, 4, 698, 226, 420, 94, 104, 69, 5, 2, 104, 5, 42, 8, 450, 2, 8, 236, 51, 106, 550, 721, 579, 128, 3, 150, 1, 2129, 2, 1071, 447, 23, 8, 7053, 1055, 1097, 44, 2946, 195, 193, 4, 541, 520, 6, 3215, 155]",1874.0,16001174,246

Health and economic benefits of well-designed evaluations: some lessons from evaluating neuroblastoma screening.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2005-08-01,"Well-designed evaluations of health services are frequently made today. However, the extent of the evaluations' benefits and costs is not well documented, creating uncertainty whether their use is optimal from society's perspective. We examined these costs and benefits using data from one well-designed evaluation, the Quebec Neuroblastoma Screening Project (QNSP). It screened most Quebec newborns between 1989 and 1994 for neuroblastoma. As previously reported, the screening did not reduce neuroblastoma mortality and caused adverse health effects. We compared the cost of doing the QNSP with its benefits. Had the QNSP not been undertaken, neuroblastoma screening would have been implemented throughout North America. We assume that screening would have started in 1989 and ended in 2002. The QNSP's benefits include the health costs and adverse health effects averted by not using ineffective screening during those 14 years. In our calculations we used neuroblastoma incidence data for the QNSP and for Ontario where there was no screening, detailed data describing the health services used by the patients, and Quebec cost data for those services. The QNSP cost 8.77 million dollars (2002 US dollars). By not implementing similar screening programs between 1989 and 2002, the United States and Canada avoided 574.1 million dollars in health costs, the unnecessary treatment of 9223 children, and false-positive findings for 5003 children screened.

Biomarkers Prev.,2005-08-01,"We determined risk of cancer among first-degree relatives of 5-year survivors of childhood leukemia, lymphoma, central nervous system tumors, sarcomas, Wilms' tumor, and neuroblastoma. Subjects were 13,703 participants in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. Family history was collected on 56,759 first-degree relatives using a self-reported questionnaire. Incidence was compared with age- and sex-specific rates using the U.S. Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program. Siblings of the survivors had an increased risk of cancer [standardized incidence ratio (SIR), 1.5; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.35-1.7]. Risk was elevated for siblings of probands of leukemia (SIR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.6), Hodgkin's disease (SIR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.9), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (SIR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.5), Wilms' tumor (SIR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-3.2), soft tissue sarcoma (SIR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0-2.2), and bone tumors (SIR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.2).

Hyperdiploidy plus nonamplified MYCN confers a favorable prognosis in children 12 to 18 months old with disseminated neuroblastoma: a Pediatric Oncology Group study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2005-08-22,"To determine predictive strength of tumor cell ploidy and MYCN gene amplification on survival of children older than 12 months with disseminated neuroblastoma (NB). Of 648 children with stage D NB enrolled onto the Pediatric Oncology Group NB Biology Study 9047 (1990-2000), 560 children were assessable for ploidy and MYCN amplification. Treatment of patients older than 12 months varied; most receiving high-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell rescue. Infants received standard chemotherapy, depending on MYCN status and ploidy. Among stage D MYCN-amplified patients, 4-year event-free survival (EFS) +/- SE had no prognostic significance for tumor cell ploidy for patients either younger than 12 months or > or = 12 months old. However, among stage D nonamplified-MYCN patients, 4-year EFS for those with tumor hyperdiploidy (DNA index [DI] > 1) was clearly superior to those with diploidy (DI < or = 1): younger than 12 months, 83.7% +/- 4.4% (n = 87) versus 46.2% +/- 13.8% (n = 13; P = .0003); and for 12- to 24-month-old children, 72.7% +/- 10.2% (n = 22) versus 26.7% +/- 13.2% (n = 16; P = .0092). Further analysis suggested better prognoses in the 12- to 18-month-old subgroup with hyperdiploid tumors (4-year EFS, 92.9% +/- 7.2%) compared with the 19- to 24-month-old subgroup (4-year EFS, 37.5% +/- 21.0%; P = .0037). In children older than 24 months, outcome was dire (< 20% long-term survival), regardless of ploidy or MYCN status. Children 12 to 18 months old with metastatic NB had favorable outcomes with high-dose therapy if their tumors were hyperdiploid and lacked MYCN amplification.

Favorable prognosis for patients 12 to 18 months of age with stage 4 nonamplified MYCN neuroblastoma: a Children's Cancer Group Study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2005-08-22,"The long-term survival of children between age 12 and 24 months with stage 4 neuroblastoma and nonamplified MYCN (MYCN-NA) has not been defined previously. Survival for stage 4 MYCN-NA neuroblastoma patients enrolled onto Children's Cancer Group (CCG) protocols 321P2 (1986 to 1991) and 3891 (1991 to 1996) was analyzed. Treatment consisted of intensive alkylator-based induction chemotherapy with or without autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) with or without 13 cis-retinoic acid. Survival was analyzed by age strata less than 12, 12 to 18, 18 to 24, and more than 24 months at diagnosis. Patients younger than 12 months were treated on the moderate-intensity CCG protocol 3881. Forty-three patients with stage 4 MYCN-NA disease enrolled onto CCG-321P2 (n = 17) or CCG-3891 (n = 26) were between 12 and 24 months of age at diagnosis. After a median follow-up of 94 months (range, 4 to 140 months), the 6-year event-free survival (EFS) for the 12- to 18-month age group was superior to that of the 18- to 24-month age group (74% +/- 8% v 31% +/- 12%; P = .008). The EFS for children older than 24 months with stage 4 MYCN-NA neuroblastoma was 23% +/- 3%, and for children younger than 12 months was 92% +/- 3%.

The 5-year survival estimates were comparable for the 90 patients who had a GTR and the 17 who underwent surgery but did not have a GTR (29.9% +/- 5.1% [standard error] vs. 29.4% +/- 10.1%). The 7 patients who underwent GTR at the time of diagnosis had a higher 5-year survival estimate than the 83 patients who had a GTR after induction chemotherapy (83.3% +/- 13.9% vs. 25.2% +/- 5.0%) (P = 0.001). Five-year event-free survival estimates were similarly higher in the initial-GTR group (57.1% +/- 18.7% vs. 14.5% +/- 4.2%) (P = 0.002). These two groups did not differ significantly in age at diagnosis (P = 0.118), site of primary tumor (P = 0.34), MYCN amplification status (P = 1), serum lactate dehydrogenase activity at diagnosis (P = 0.34), or treatment protocol (P = 0.22). Twenty-two (21%) patients had a surgical complication. In this small cohort of patients with metastatic neuroblastoma, GTR at the time of diagnosis offered a survival benefit. Further prospective studies are warranted before this approach can be applied to all patients with metastatic neuroblastoma.",Comparative Study,5164.0,29.0,It remains unclear whether primary tumor resection benefits patients with metastatic The authors assessed the impact of extent and timing of resection on outcome in these patients The authors reviewed the records of 124 patients 1 year of age at diagnosis of International Staging System Stage 4 The survival estimates of those who did and did not have a gross total resection GTR and of those who had initial versus delayed GTR were compared Surgical complications were reviewed The 5-year survival estimates were comparable for the 90 patients who had a GTR and the 17 who underwent surgery but did not have a GTR 29.9 +/- 5.1 standard error vs. 29.4 +/- 10.1 The 7 patients who underwent GTR at the time of diagnosis had a higher 5-year survival estimate than the 83 patients who had a GTR after induction chemotherapy 83.3 +/- 13.9 vs. 25.2 +/- 5.0 P 0.001 Five-year event-free survival estimates were similarly higher in the initial-GTR group 57.1 +/- 18.7 vs. 14.5 +/- 4.2 P 0.002 These two groups did not differ significantly in age at diagnosis P 0.118 site of primary tumor P 0.34 MYCN amplification status P 1 serum lactate dehydrogenase activity at diagnosis P 0.34 or treatment protocol P 0.22 Twenty-two 21 patients had a surgical complication In this small cohort of patients with metastatic GTR at the time of diagnosis offered a survival benefit Further prospective studies are warranted before this approach can be applied to all patients with metastatic,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[192, 469, 1200, 317, 86, 30, 170, 1141, 7, 5, 113, 3, 738, 275, 3, 345, 1, 1039, 2, 1972, 1, 170, 23, 228, 4, 46, 7, 3, 738, 446, 3, 1064, 1, 2834, 7, 14, 111, 1, 89, 28, 147, 1, 944, 632, 398, 82, 39, 3, 25, 1423, 1, 135, 54, 205, 2, 205, 44, 47, 8, 1789, 181, 170, 4833, 2, 1, 135, 54, 42, 388, 185, 1612, 4833, 11, 72, 221, 521, 11, 446, 3, 33, 111, 25, 1423, 11, 1279, 9, 3, 424, 7, 54, 42, 8, 4833, 2, 3, 269, 54, 208, 152, 84, 205, 44, 47, 8, 4833, 462, 83, 33, 14, 260, 3444, 105, 462, 39, 79, 14, 3, 67, 7, 54, 208, 4833, 28, 3, 98, 1, 147, 42, 8, 142, 33, 111, 25, 1191, 76, 3, 852, 7, 54, 42, 8, 4833, 50, 504, 56, 852, 27, 233, 83, 105, 243, 18, 33, 13, 19, 13, 144, 365, 111, 774, 115, 25, 1423, 11, 1813, 142, 4, 3, 388, 4833, 87, 696, 14, 203, 67, 105, 213, 33, 39, 18, 19, 13, 1111, 46, 100, 271, 205, 44, 1505, 97, 4, 89, 28, 147, 19, 13, 4002, 606, 1, 86, 30, 19, 13, 562, 4068, 1073, 156, 19, 14, 524, 3330, 2374, 128, 28, 147, 19, 13, 562, 15, 24, 1182, 19, 13, 350, 737, 100, 239, 7, 42, 8, 221, 1447, 4, 26, 302, 180, 1, 7, 5, 113, 4833, 28, 3, 98, 1, 147, 2216, 8, 25, 247, 195, 482, 94, 32, 1197, 348, 26, 353, 122, 40, 1498, 6, 62, 7, 5, 113]",1471.0,16288490,61
"Evaluation of the antitumor efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the histone deacetylase inhibitor depsipeptide in childhood cancer models in vivo.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2006-01-01,"Histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDAC) control the acetylation state of histones and other proteins regulating transcription and protein function. Several structurally diverse HDAC inhibitors have been developed as cancer therapeutic agents and in vitro have been shown to cause differentiation, cell cycle arrest, or apoptosis. Here, we have evaluated depsipeptide, a natural tetrapeptide HDAC inhibitor, against a panel of pediatric solid tumor models in vivo and evaluated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variables with tumor sensitivity. Depsipeptide was administered at the maximum tolerated dose (4.4 mg/kg administered every 7 days x 3 i.v. repeated q21d for a total of two cycles) to scid mice bearing 39 independently derived childhood tumors (9 brain tumors, 11 kidney cancers, 9 rhabdomyosarcomas, 3 neuroblastomas, and 7 osteosarcomas). Pharmacokinetic variables were determined, as were changes in histone and p53 acetylation, induction of p53 and p53 genotype, and alterations in Akt phosphorylation. Of 39 tumors evaluated, three showed objective tumor regressions [two brain tumors (primitive neuroectodermal tumor and atypical teratoid malignant rhabdoid tumor) and one Wilms' tumor]. Depsipeptide inhibited growth of many tumor lines but achieved stable disease (<25% increase in volume during treatment cycle 1) in only two tumor models (anaplastic astrocytoma, two rhabdomyosarcomas, and a Wilms' tumor). Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the population estimated AUC(0-24) was 1,123 ng h/mL, similar to the exposure following 13 mg/m2 in ongoing phase I trials. Pharmacodynamic changes in histone acetylation (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) in three depsipeptide-sensitive and three intrinsically resistant tumors followed a similar pattern; maximal increases in histone acetylation occurred at 8 hours and were elevated for up to 96 hours. In two sensitive tumor lines, IRS56 and BT27 (both wild-type p53) p53 increased in treated tumors being maximal at 8 hours and associated with induction of p21(cip1), whereas p53 was stable in tumors with mutant p53. Sensitivity to depsipeptide did not correlate with p53 genotype, p53 acetylation, cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, or phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473). Our results show that depsipeptide inhibits its target in vivo causing increased histone acetylation; however, this does not correlate with drug sensitivity. The relatively low objective response rate [3 of 39 (8%) tumor lines showing greater than or equal to partial response and 4 (10%) stable disease] administered at dose levels that give clinically relevant drug exposures suggests that as a single agent depsipeptide may have limited clinical utility against pediatric solid tumors in a first-line setting.",Journal Article,5133.0,75.0,"Histone

"Examination of mutations in BRAF, NRAS, and PTEN in primary cutaneous melanoma.",The Journal of investigative dermatology,J. Invest. Dermatol.,2006-01-01,"Frequent somatic mutation of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF), a downstream effector of the rat sarcoma oncogene (RAS) signaling pathway, is described in melanoma and other tumors. Our analysis of melanoma cell lines suggests that activating mutations in BRAF can occur simultaneously with inactivation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), but neuroblastoma RAS (NRAS) mutations are not coincident. We determined the concurrent prevalence of mutations in BRAF and NRAS, and alteration of PTEN expression in 69 primary cutaneous melanomas. BRAF mutations were seen in 57% of cases. NRAS was mutated in 17% of samples, exclusively in exon 2. Two cases showed concurrent BRAF and NRAS mutations. Using immunohistochemistry, PTEN protein expression was lost or greatly reduced in 19% of tumors. Seven tumors with reduced PTEN yielded DNA amenable to sequencing, and three also showed mutation in BRAF but none in NRAS. In all, 11 (85%) of 13 tumors showing reduced PTEN expression were greater than 3.5 mm thick, and the association of increasing Breslow thickness and loss or reduction of PTEN expression was statistically significant (P<0.0001).

Risk of selected subsequent carcinomas in survivors of childhood cancer: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2006-01-01,"To determine the risk of subsequent carcinomas other than breast, thyroid, and skin, and to identify factors that influence the risk among survivors of childhood cancer. Subsequent malignant neoplasm history was determined in 13,136 participants (surviving > or = 5 years postmalignancy, diagnosed from 1970 to 1986 at age < 21 years) of the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study to calculate standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data. In 71 individuals, 71 carcinomas were diagnosed at a median age of 27 years and a median elapsed time of 15 years in the genitourinary system (35%), head and neck area (32%), gastrointestinal tract (23%), and other sites (10%). Fifty-nine patients (83%) had received radiotherapy, and 42 (59%) developed a second malignant neoplasm in a previous radiotherapy field. Risk was significantly elevated following all childhood diagnoses except CNS neoplasms, and was highest following neuroblastoma (SIR = 24.2) and soft tissue sarcoma (SIR = 6.2). Survivors of neuroblastoma had a 329-fold increased risk of renal cell carcinomas; survivors of Hodgkin's lymphoma had a 4.5-fold increased risk of gastrointestinal carcinomas.

Based on the quantitation of 24 normal marrow and peripheral blood samples, a normalized STX transcript value below the mean + 2SD was defined as negative. Sensitivity of this assay was 1 NB cell in 10(6) normal mononuclear cells. STX expression was high among NB tumors of all stages, as well as NB cell lines of different phenotypes. Evaluation for early (2.5 months from protocol entry) marrow response by univariate Cox model indicated that STX marker status (positive versus negative) was strongly associated with both progression-free and overall survival (p < 0.0005 for both).

Integrative genomics identifies distinct molecular classes of neuroblastoma and shows that multiple genes are targeted by regional alterations in DNA copy number.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2006-06-01,"Neuroblastoma is remarkable for its clinical heterogeneity and is characterized by genomic alterations that are strongly correlated with tumor behavior. The specific genes that influence neuroblastoma biology and are targeted by genomic alterations remain largely unknown. We quantified mRNA expression in a highly annotated series of 101 prospectively collected diagnostic neuroblastoma primary tumors using an oligonucleotide-based microarray. Genomic copy number status at the prognostically relevant loci 1p36, 2p24 (MYCN), 11q23, and 17q23 was determined by PCR and was aberrant in 26, 20, 40, and 38 cases, respectively. In addition, 72 diagnostic neuroblastoma primary tumors assayed in a different laboratory were used as an independent validation set. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering showed that gene expression was highly correlated with genomic alterations and clinical markers of tumor behavior. The vast majority of samples with MYCN amplification and 1p36 loss of heterozygosity (LOH) clustered together on a terminal node of the sample dendrogram, whereas the majority of samples with 11q deletion clustered separately and both of these were largely distinct from the copy number neutral group of tumors. Genes involved in neurodevelopment were broadly overrepresented in the more benign tumors, whereas genes involved in RNA processing and cellular proliferation were highly represented in the most malignant cases. By combining transcriptomic and genomic data, we showed that LOH at 1p and 11q was associated with significantly decreased expression of 122 (61%) and 88 (27%) of the genes mapping to 1p35-36 and all of 11q, respectively, suggesting that multiple genes may be targeted by LOH events.

Ototoxicity from high-dose use of platinum compounds in patients with neuroblastoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2006-07-01,"The young age of neuroblastoma patients makes them especially prone to the ototoxic effects of widely used treatments that feature aggressive use of platinum compounds. We present data defining the extent of the problem in a large series of neuroblastoma patients whose induction included high-dose cisplatin/etoposide (HD-P/E) as used in both the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center N7 regimen and the Children's Oncology Group A3973 study. N7/A3973 patients were divided into 3 groups: Group 1 had hearing tested after induction, that included 2 cycles of HD-P/E (cumulative cisplatin = 400 mg/m(2)); Group 2 had hearing tested after induction, that included 3 cycles of HD-P/E (cumulative cisplatin = 600 mg/m(2)); and Group 3 had hearing tested following carboplatin-containing myeloablative therapy administered after induction, that included 2 cycles of HD-P/E. Ototoxicity was scored by the Brock method. All 3 groups had similar clinical characteristics, including median age at diagnosis of about 3 years. Little or no hearing loss in the speech range (Grade 0/1) was documented in 21 (32%) of the 65 Group 1 patients, 5 (10%) of the 50 Group 2 patients, and 9 (15.5%) of the 58 Group 3 patients. Severe (Grade 3/4) deficits affected 25% of Group 1, 54% of Group 2, and 50% of Group 3 patients. Patients < 5 years at diagnosis had greater ototoxicity than older patients had, with adolescents/adults being the least affected. Findings were stable in repeated assessments over 2 or more years.

High-risk neuroblastoma treated with tandem autologous peripheral-blood stem cell-supported transplantation: long-term survival update.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2006-06-01,"To provide an update on long-term survival of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma treated with tandem cycles of myeloablative therapy and peripheral-blood stem-cell rescue (PBSCR). Ninety-seven patients with high-risk neuroblastoma were treated between 1994 and 2002. Patients underwent induction therapy with five cycles of standard agents, resection of the primary tumor and local radiation, and two consecutive courses of myeloablative therapy (including total-body irradiation) with PBSCR. Fifty-one patients have experienced relapse or died. Median follow-up time among the 46 patients who remain alive without progression is 5.6 years (range, 15.1 months to 9.9 years). Progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 5 years from diagnosis was 47% (95% CI, 36% to 56%), and PFS rate at 7 years was 45% (95% CI, 34% to 55%). Overall survival rate was 60% (95% CI, 48% to 69%) and 53% (95% CI, 40% to 64%) at 5 and 7 years, respectively.

Evaluation of gefitinib for treatment of refractory solid tumors and central nervous system malignancies in pediatric patients.,Cancer investigation,Cancer Invest.,,"Gefitinib (ZD1839, Iressa), a member of the 4-anilinoquinazoline class of compounds, has the chemical name 4-quinazolinamine, N-(3-chloro-4-flurophenyl)-7-methoxy-6-[3-(4-morpholinyl)propoxy]. Gefitinib often is referred to as a ""specific"" or ""selective"" inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR expression has been noted in neuroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines and in tumor specimens from children with Wilms tumor, osteosarcoma, and glioma. Thus, gefitinib, the first marketed EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was chosen for study in children with refractory solid tumors and central nervous system (CNS) malignancies. This review discusses findings from 3 clinical trials of gefitinib in children with refractory solid tumors and CNS malignancies, focusing on the clinical pharmacology of the compound. To date, gefitinib has been studied in children as a single agent and in combination with irinotecan.

More than 90% of the study population was 18-34 years old at interview, and 58% were females. There was no significant difference on any SF-36 subscale or summary scale between the two diagnostic groups. On average, survivors reported no decrement on the Physical Component Summary scale of the SF-36 when compared to population norms. However, both groups scored significantly below the population mean score (50) on the Mental Component Summary Scale of the SF-36 (Wilms tumor mean = 41.66, standard error = 2.19, P < 0.0001; neuroblastoma mean = 42.41, standard error = 2.23, P < 0.0001) reflecting decreased emotional health.

A novel pattern of transaminase elevation associated with autologous transplant for neuroblastoma.,Pediatric transplantation,Pediatr Transplant,2006-09-01,"To determine the pattern and degree of hepatic transaminitis experienced by children undergoing autologous transplantation for neuroblastoma. Sixty-four children with high-risk neuroblastoma received an autologous transplant with cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and carboplatin conditioning. Forty-eight went on to receive a second transplant with M and TBI conditioning. Charts were reviewed for evidence of hepatic regimen-related toxicity. A high rate of transaminitis was observed after both regimens. In each transplant, there was an early period of transaminitis during conditioning, from which patients recovered, followed by a second period of transaminase elevation. The degree of elevation was not associated with age, whether the administered dose was calculated based on a per kg or per M(2) basis or the presence of regimen-related severe mucositis. Elevated transaminases at admission were not associated with maximal hepatotoxicity during the first transplant although there was an association in the second transplant. However, the magnitude of transaminase elevation was less in the second transplant. VOD occurred in one and three patients in transplants 1 and 2, respectively. Both conditioning regimens were associated with an early and late elevation of transaminases without significant cholestasis. This biphasic pattern of transaminitis has not been reported previously.

We report our experience of using EPP in children to treat a variety of malignancies that involve the pleural surface. We performed a retrospective review of all children treated through EPP at our institution. Data were obtained from patient charts and a pediatric database. All patients underwent en bloc resection of the pleura, lung, diaphragm, and pericardium and reconstruction. Four patients underwent EPP from 2000 to 2004 for inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, spindle cell sarcoma, metastatic neuroblastoma, and malignant mesothelioma. The patients' ages were from 6 to 11 years.

Does MYCN amplification manifested as homogeneously staining regions at diagnosis predict a worse outcome in children with neuroblastoma? A Children's Oncology Group study.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2006-10-01,"MYCN amplification in neuroblastoma tumor cells is manifested primarily as double minutes (dmins), whereas in cell lines it often appears in the form of homogeneously staining regions (HSR), suggesting that HSRs are associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype and worse clinical outcome. The aim of this study was to determine whether children with neuroblastoma in which MYCN oncogene amplification is manifested as HSRs at diagnosis have a worse prognosis than those whose tumors exhibit dmins. A retrospective analysis of primary neuroblastomas analyzed for MYCN amplification by the Children's Oncology Group between 1993 and 2004 was done. Tumors with MYCN amplification were defined as having dmins, HSRs, or both (dmins + HSRs), and associations with currently used risk group stratification variables and patient outcome were assessed. Of the 4,102 tumor samples analyzed, 800 (19.5%) had MYCN amplification. Among the 677 tumors for which the pattern of amplification was known, 629 (92.9%) had dmins, 40 (5.9%) had HSRs, and 8 (0.1%) had dmins + HSRs. Although MYCN amplification is associated with older age, higher stage, and unfavorable histology, whether the amplification occurred as dmins or HSRs did not significantly affect these risk factors. There were no differences in the event-free survival (EFS) or overall survival in patients with MYCN amplification manifested as either dmins or HSRs (5-year EFS, 35 +/- 3% versus 38 +/- 15%; P = 0.59). Although the eight patients with dmins + HSRs fared worse than either of the individual subgroups (EFS, 18 +/- 16% versus 35 +/- 3% for dmins and 38 +/- 15% for HSRs), these differences were not significant.

Seven NB cell lines and 30 bone marrow (BM) samples from patients with high-risk NB were analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for MYCN expression, and for the established NB marker tyrosine hydroxylase. MYCN was expressed in all 7 NB cell lines, but not in normal peripheral blood, CD34 cells, or BM. In dilution studies using cell lines with or without DNA amplification of MYCN, 1 NB cell in 10 to 10 nucleated blood cells was detectable by RT-PCR. MYCN was identified in all 21 BM samples in which tumor cells were identified by histologic examination, including 4 samples in which tyrosine hydroxylase was not detected. Additionally, expression of both markers was detected in 5 samples that were negative by histology but presumably contained low levels of tumor cells, consistent with the greater sensitivity of RT-PCR compared with morphologic methods. Detection of MYCN RNA was independent of MYCN DNA amplification status.

Interferon beta-mediated vessel stabilization improves delivery and efficacy of systemically administered topotecan in a murine neuroblastoma model.,Journal of pediatric surgery,J. Pediatr. Surg.,2007-01-01,"We have recently demonstrated that continuous delivery of interferon beta (IFN-beta) stabilizes solid tumor vasculature and improves tumor perfusion. In this study, we have further investigated the functional consequences of this effect by assessing delivery and efficacy of conventional chemotherapy against neuroblastoma xenografts when used in combination with IFN-beta. Mice with established retroperitoneal tumors received adeno-associated virus vector encoding IFN-beta (AAV IFN-beta) or control vector. One week later, at 1 hour before sacrifice, a 1 mg/kg i.v. bolus of topotecan (TPT) was given. Intratumoral levels of TPT were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography and then standardized to plasma levels to determine tumor TPT penetration. Subsequent experiments evaluated the antitumor efficacy of topotecan alone or in combination with AAV IFN-beta. As observed in prior experiments, AAV IFN-beta resulted in a marked increase in tumor vessel association with stabilizing perivascular smooth muscle cells. These more ""matured"" vessels facilitated improved tumor TPT penetration (51.2% +/- 4.2%) compared with controls (30.8% +/- 4.7%, P = .004). In additional cohorts of mice, this resulted in an improved antitumor effect. Mice with established tumors (301.8 +/- 18.1 mm3) were treated with TPT (1 mg/kg daily for 5 days for 2 consecutive weeks) either alone or in combination with AAV IFN-beta (5 x 10(10) vector particles per mouse). Topotecan monotherapy resulted in a reduction in mean tumor volume of 12% (264.2 +/- 65.8 mm3, P = .66).

Comprehensive analysis of tumoral DNA content reveals clonal ploidy heterogeneity as a marker with prognostic significance in locoregional neuroblastoma.,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",Genes Chromosomes Cancer,2007-04-01,"The clinical management of locoregional neuroblastoma (LR NB) is controversial. In a previous study we showed that diploidy was a strong prognostic predictor of outcome and detected the existence of clonal ploidy heterogeneity in a select group of cases. The aims of this study were (1) to assess the frequency of ploidy heterogeneity in LR NB, (2) to ascertain the best method to detect heteterogeneity, and (3) to correlate ploidy populations with clinical outcome. We undertook a comprehensive analysis of tumoral DNA content in 38 LR NBs comparing (1) flow cytometry (FCM), (2) karyotyping, (3) interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization, and (4) laser-scanning cytometry (LSC). Tumor ploidy heterogeneity was found by all methodologies. By FCM, all tumors with aneuploid peaks had detectable diploid DNA peaks. By LSC, all tumors with diploid and hyperploid peaks were GD2-positive in both, consistent with their tumoral origin. A predominant near-triploid clonal population (ratio diploid vs. triploid, <2.5) was observed in most nonprogressing LR NB tumors, and a predominant diploid clone (ratio di- vs. triploid, >2.5) in most progressing LR NB cases. Multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the prognostic value of tumor ploidy assayed by different methods versus age, INSS (International Neuroblastoma Staging System) stage, and MYCN status. FCM was the most powerful prognostic factor related to poor prognosis (overall survival, P = 0.02; progression-free survival, P = 0.01).

Genome-wide analysis of neuroblastomas using high-density single nucleotide polymorphism arrays.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2007-02-28,"Neuroblastomas are characterized by chromosomal alterations with biological and clinical significance. We analyzed paired blood and primary tumor samples from 22 children with high-risk neuroblastoma for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and DNA copy number change using the Affymetrix 10K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. Multiple areas of LOH and copy number gain were seen. The most commonly observed area of LOH was on chromosome arm 11q (15/22 samples; 68%). Chromosome 11q LOH was highly associated with occurrence of chromosome 3p LOH: 9 of the 15 samples with 11q LOH had concomitant 3p LOH (P = 0.016). Chromosome 1p LOH was seen in one-third of cases. LOH events on chromosomes 11q and 1p were generally accompanied by copy number loss, indicating hemizygous deletion within these regions. The one exception was on chromosome 11p, where LOH in all four cases was accompanied by normal copy number or diploidy, implying uniparental disomy. Gain of copy number was most frequently observed on chromosome arm 17q (21/22 samples; 95%) and was associated with allelic imbalance in six samples. Amplification of MYCN was also noted, and also amplification of a second gene, ALK, in a single case.

Cancer Res.,2007-03-01,"Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is essential for the posttranslational control of many regulators of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. 17-N-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) binds to Hsp90 and alters levels of proteins regulated by Hsp90. We conducted a phase I trial of 17-AAG in pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and desmoplastic small round cell tumor to determine the maximum tolerated dose, define toxicity and pharmacokinetic profiles, and generate data about molecular target modulation. Escalating doses of 17-AAG were administered i.v. over 1 to 2 h twice weekly for 2 weeks every 21 days until patients experienced disease progression or toxicity. harmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were done during cycle 1. Fifteen patients were enrolled onto dose levels between 150 and 360 mg/m(2); 13 patients were evaluable for toxicity. The maximum tolerated dose was 270 mg/m(2). DLTs were grade 3 transaminitis and hypoxia. Two patients with osteosarcoma and bulky pulmonary metastases died during cycle 1 and were not evaluable for toxicity.

Disialoganglioside directed immunotherapy of neuroblastoma.,Cancer investigation,Cancer Invest.,2007-02-01,"Achieving a cure for metastatic neuroblastoma remains a challenge despite sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Most patients achieve remission, but a failure to eliminate minimal residual disease (MRD) often leads to relapse. Immunotherapy is potentially useful for chemotherapy-resistant disease and may be particularly effective for low levels of MRD that are below the threshold for detection by routine radiological and histological methods. Disialoganglioside (GD2), a surface glycolipid antigen that is ubiquitous and abundant on neuroblastoma cells is an ideal target for immunotherapy. Anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies currently form the mainstay of neuroblastoma immunotherapy and their safety profile has been well-established. Although responses in patients with gross disease have been observed infrequently, histologic responses of bone marrow disease are consistently achieved in >75 percent of patients with primary refractory neuroblastoma. The advent of highly sensitive and specific molecular assays to measure MRD has confirmed the efficacy anti-GD2 antibody immunotherapy in patients with subclinical disease. Such markers will allow further optimization of other anti-MRD therapies.

We evaluated cyclin D1 (CCND1), a cell-cycle control gene, as a novel MRD marker of NB. Using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we studied CCND1 expression in 133 solid tumors of different histological types, including 39 NB tumors, and examined its potential clinical utility as an early response marker in the bone marrows before and after treatment of 118 stage 4 patients enrolled after induction chemotherapy in an immunotherapy protocol. Based on 40 normal marrow and peripheral blood samples, a CCND1 transcript value greater than the mean + 2 SD was defined as positive. Sensitivity of this assay was one NB cell in 10(6) normal mononuclear cells. CCND1 transcript levels were high in NB, breast cancer, and Ewing family tumors. Among the NB patients evaluated, early (2.5 months from protocol entry) marrow response was strongly associated with both progression-free (P=0.0001) and overall survival (P=0.0006). CCND1 response remained predictive of survival among a subset of 66 patients who had no histological evidence of marrow disease before immunotherapy.

Significance of pleural effusion in neuroblastoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2007-12-01,"Pleural effusion is uncommon at diagnosis of neuroblastoma in children. Because the presence of malignant cells in pleural fluid may significantly change the management and outcome of patients with neuroblastoma, we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of neuroblastoma patients who presented with pleural effusion at the time of diagnosis to determine the incidence, presentation, stage, treatment, and outcome of these patients. We reviewed the presenting features of 295 patients with the diagnosis of neuroblastoma who received treatment at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital between 1991 and 2005. Patients were chosen for further analysis if pleural effusion had been identified on chest radiographs or computed tomography (CT) scans at diagnosis Thirty-one out of 295(10.5%) patients with neuroblastoma had pleural effusion identified at time of presentation. International neuroblastoma staging system (INSS) risk stratification was high risk in 29 cases and intermediate risk and low risk in 1 case each. The primary site of disease was abdomen in 26 patients; mediastinum in 5. We conducted cytologic analysis of pleural fluid of nine patients; the specimen of seven contained malignant cells.

Bevacizumab-induced transient remodeling of the vasculature in neuroblastoma xenografts results in improved delivery and efficacy of systemically administered chemotherapy.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2007-07-01,"Dysfunctional tumor vessels can be a significant barrier to effective cancer therapy. However, increasing evidence suggests that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition can effect transient ""normalization"" of the tumor vasculature, thereby improving tumor perfusion and, consequently, delivery of systemic chemotherapy. We sought to examine temporal changes in tumor vascular function in response to the anti-VEGF antibody, bevacizumab. Established orthotopic neuroblastoma xenografts treated with bevacizumab were evaluated at serial time points for treatment-associated changes in intratumoral vascular physiology, penetration of systemically administered chemotherapy, and efficacy of combination therapy. After a single bevacizumab dose, a progressive decrease in tumor microvessel density to <30% of control was observed within 7 days. Assessment of the tumor microenvironment revealed a rapid, sustained decrease in both tumor vessel permeability and tumor interstitial fluid pressure, whereas intratumoral perfusion, as assessed by contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, was improved, although this latter change abated by 1 week. Intratumoral drug delivery mirrored these changes; penetration of chemotherapy was improved by as much as 81% when given 1 to 3 days after bevacizumab, compared with when both drugs were given concomitantly, or 7 days apart. Finally, administering topotecan to tumor-bearing mice 3 days after bevacizumab resulted in greater tumor growth inhibition (36% of control size) than with monotherapy (88% bevacizumab, 54% topotecan) or concomitant administration of the two drugs (44%).

Outcomes were determined by calculating parent-reported scores to questions from the behavior problem index. Survivors and siblings were similar in age at the time of interview (mean: 14.8, survivors; 14.9, siblings; range, 12 to 17 years). Overall, multivariate analyses showed that survivors were 1.5 times (99% CI, 1.1 to 2.1) more likely than siblings to have symptoms of depression/anxiety and 1.7 times (99% CI, 1.3 to 2.2) more likely to have antisocial behaviors.

Incidence of neuroblastoma after a screening program.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2007-11-01,"A significant increase in the incidence of neuroblastoma occurred among a 5-year birth cohort (May 1989 to April 1994) during an active urinary screening program for its early detection. We examined the postscreening incidence of neuroblastoma in the subsequent 5-year birth cohort (May 1994 to April 1999), with follow-up to 2002, to determine whether the incidence remained increased. We reviewed institutional records of patients diagnosed with neuroblastoma during the period from 1994 to 2002 who were born in 1994 to 1999 in the province of Quebec, as well as in the state of Minnesota and the province of Ontario, regions that had served as controls during the screening interval. We calculated and compared incidence rates during the 1994 to 2002 time period. For the 5-year birth cohort as a whole, the rate of newly diagnosed neuroblastoma was higher in Quebec than in the control populations of Minnesota and Ontario (standardized incidence ratio, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.70).

Radiotherapy may enhance local control; however, irradiating the brain is undesirable in young patients. The purpose of this study was to describe the technique, outcome and toxicities in patients with high risk NB metastatic to the skull treated with brain-sparing skull radiotherapy (BSRT). Between 1999 and 2007, 31 patients with INSS stage four high risk NB, aged 2-32 years (median 6 years), underwent multimodality therapy, including radiotherapy to the whole skull using a brain-sparing technique never previously described in this population. Dosimetric analyses were performed to compare the BSRT technique to a whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) technique. Patients were either treated to consolidate upfront induction therapy (n = 22) or to palliate relapsed disease (n = 9). Thirty of 31 patients (97%) completed the full course of BSRT. Median follow-up was 19 months (range 1-83 months). Radiographic response to therapy was noted in 89% of patients. The actuarial rate of disease control in the skull was 89% and 60% 1 year after starting BSRT in patients treated in consolidation and for palliation, respectively. BSRT delivered half of the mean radiation dose to the brain when dosimetrically compared to whole brain radiotherapy. Few patients experienced significant toxicity.

Through a mailed survey that included the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 and an outcomes questionnaire for parents, we evaluated 137 children (aged 8-17 years) who were previously enrolled in 1 of 2 Children's Cancer Group neuroblastoma clinical studies. Childhood survivors of neuroblastoma who had prevalent hearing loss, as reported by their parents, had at least twice the risk of an identified problem with reading skills, math skills, and/or attention and a similarly higher risk of a general learning disability and/or special educational needs than did neuroblastoma survivors without hearing loss. Consistent with this finding, hearing loss was associated with a 10-point-lower mean score in the school-functioning scale of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0. We also observed a clear pattern of poorer self-reported quality-of-life scores among children with parent-reported academic and psychosocial problems compared with those without such problems, particularly with school functioning, even after controlling for reported hearing loss. We found evidence that long-term neuroblastoma survivors, especially those with hearing loss, are at elevated risk for academic learning problems and psychosocial difficulties.

Recently, SOS1 gain of function mutations have also been shown to cause NS. Somatic PTPN11, KRAS, and RAF1 mutations occur (although at different frequencies) in a variety of sporadic neoplasms, but whether SOS1 mutations are associated with human cancer has not been evaluated. We sequenced DNA from a total of 810 primary malignancies, including pancreatic, lung, breast, and colon carcinomas, and acute myelogenous leukemia, as well as several neuroblastoma cell lines. From this large, diverse series, missense SOS1 mutations were identified in a single pancreatic tumor, one lung adenocarcinoma, and a T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line.

Cancer Res.,2008-01-01,"The study aims to use mathematical modeling and simulation to assess the relative contribution of topotecan systemic exposure and scheduling in the activity and myelosuppression of topotecan in pediatric patients with neuroblastoma. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data were obtained from a phase II study for pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. The topotecan dosage was individualized to attain a topotecan lactone area under the plasma concentration-time curve between 80 and 120 ng/mL h and given over a protracted schedule (i.e., 10 days). Four mathematical models describing topotecan pharmacokinetics, tumor growth, and neutrophil and platelet dynamics were developed. The models were combined to simulate and compare different topotecan treatment strategies with respect to systemic exposure and schedule. The median change in tumor volume was significantly different between schedules (5% increase for D x 5 versus 60% decrease for D x 5 x 2; P < 0.0001) when administering the same total systemic exposure. Whereas protracted schedules showed increased neutropenia (median of 7 versus 12 days below an absolute neutrophil count of 500/microL; P < 0.0001) and thrombocytopenia (median of 3 versus 10 days below a platelet count of 20,000/microL; P < 0.00001), simulations showed that delays in topotecan therapy would not be required. Simulations showed that an increase in topotecan exposure on the D x 5 schedule by 2.4-fold resulted in a modest decrease in tumor volume (i.e., median percentage change tumor volume of 24% versus 3%). The present mathematical model gave an innovative approach to determining relevant topotecan schedules for possible evaluation in the clinic, which could lead to improved tumor response with minimized toxicities.",Historical Article,4403.0,36.0,"The study aims to use mathematical modeling and simulation to assess the relative contribution of topotecan systemic exposure and scheduling in the activity and myelosuppression of topotecan in pediatric patients with Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data were obtained from a phase II study for pediatric patients with high-risk The topotecan dosage was individualized to attain a topotecan lactone area under the plasma concentration-time curve between 80 and 120 ng/mL h and given over a protracted schedule i.e. 10 days Four mathematical models describing topotecan pharmacokinetics tumor growth and neutrophil and platelet dynamics were developed The models were combined to simulate and compare different topotecan treatment strategies with respect to systemic exposure and schedule The median change in tumor volume was significantly different between schedules 5 increase for D x 5 versus 60 decrease for D x 5 x 2 P 0.0001 when administering the same total systemic exposure Whereas protracted schedules showed increased neutropenia median of 7 versus 12 days below an absolute neutrophil count of 500/microL P 0.0001 and thrombocytopenia median of 3 versus 10 days below a platelet count of 20,000/microL P 0.00001 simulations showed that delays in topotecan therapy would not be required Simulations showed that an increase in topotecan exposure on the D x 5 schedule by 2.4-fold resulted in a modest decrease in tumor volume i.e. median percentage change tumor volume of 24 versus 3 The present mathematical model gave an innovative approach to determining relevant topotecan schedules for possible evaluation in the clinic which could lead to improved tumor response with minimized toxicities",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 45, 2970, 6, 119, 7419, 2057, 2, 4026, 6, 423, 3, 580, 2925, 1, 2129, 403, 645, 2, 8122, 4, 3, 128, 2, 2858, 1, 2129, 4, 815, 7, 5, 1456, 2, 2424, 74, 11, 683, 29, 8, 124, 215, 45, 9, 815, 7, 5, 64, 43, 3, 2129, 3323, 10, 2596, 6, 10719, 8, 2129, 8643, 965, 669, 3, 554, 1227, 98, 1496, 59, 493, 2, 2031, 997, 542, 555, 2, 447, 252, 8, 7053, 1055, 70, 563, 79, 162, 294, 7419, 274, 4950, 2129, 1159, 30, 129, 2, 2595, 2, 1596, 5193, 11, 276, 3, 274, 11, 397, 6, 9236, 2, 932, 338, 2129, 24, 422, 5, 2184, 6, 403, 645, 2, 1055, 3, 52, 707, 4, 30, 433, 10, 97, 338, 59, 2314, 33, 344, 9, 427, 1006, 33, 185, 335, 775, 9, 427, 1006, 33, 1006, 18, 19, 13, 488, 198, 5776, 3, 827, 181, 403, 645, 547, 7053, 2314, 224, 101, 778, 52, 1, 67, 185, 133, 162, 2736, 35, 1766, 2595, 1276, 1, 1666, 5128, 19, 13, 488, 2, 1340, 52, 1, 27, 185, 79, 162, 2736, 8, 1596, 1276, 1, 179, 984, 5128, 19, 13, 7868, 7490, 224, 17, 3257, 4, 2129, 36, 688, 44, 40, 616, 7490, 224, 17, 35, 344, 4, 2129, 645, 23, 3, 427, 1006, 33, 1055, 20, 18, 39, 1116, 627, 4, 8, 1721, 775, 4, 30, 433, 70, 563, 52, 1150, 707, 30, 433, 1, 259, 185, 27, 3, 364, 7419, 202, 6421, 35, 4019, 353, 6, 2196, 867, 2129, 2314, 9, 899, 451, 4, 3, 1188, 92, 359, 1122, 6, 231, 30, 51, 5, 9243, 385]",1708.0,18172284,154
Prospective tracing of MLL-FRYL clone with low MEIS1 expression from emergence during neuroblastoma treatment to diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome.,Blood,Blood,2008-01-14,"We prospectively observed a child exposed to intensive multimodality therapy for metastatic neuroblastoma from emergence of a MLL translocation to disease diagnosis. The t(4;11)(p12;q23) was detected in the marrow 17 months after starting treatment following topoisomerase II poisons, alkylating agents, local radiation, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody with granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, and a high cumulative dose of oral etoposide. Reciprocal genomic breakpoint junctions and fusion transcripts joined MLL with FRYL, the Drosophila melanogaster protein homologue of which regulates cell fate. Etoposide metabolites induced topoisomerase II cleavage complexes that could form both breakpoint junctions. Cells harboring the translocation replaced the marrow without clinical evidence of leukemia and differentiation appeared unaffected for 37 months. Subsequent bilineage dysplasia and increased blasts in addition to the translocation fulfilled criteria for MDS. The MEIS1 target gene of typical MLL fusion oncoproteins was underexpressed before and at MDS diagnosis. These results are consistent with repair of topoisomerase II cleavage from etoposide metabolites as the translocation mechanism, whereas other agents in the regimen may have contributed to progression of the clone with the translocation to MDS.

We describe our experience in the management of significant aortic injuries during this procedure. With the institutional review board waiver, medical records of children who had major abdominal aortic reconstruction during neuroblastoma resection from 1996 to 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. There were 5 children with aortic grafting: 3 girls and 2 boys. Mean age at surgery was 7.2 years (range, 16 months to 17 years). Two children were operated on for recurrent retroperitoneal disease. Tumor encasement of the aorta was seen in all children. In 3 children, the injury occurred during dissection of paraaortic and interaortocaval lymph nodes below the level of the renal arteries. In the remaining 2 children, injury occurred early during mobilization of the tumor. Three polytetrafluoroethylene tube grafts and 1 on-lay patch graft were used to repair the 4 distal aortic injuries. One 4-year-old female with aortic and renal arterial injuries was managed with an aortic Dacron tube graft and a polytetrafluoroethylene tube graft for the renal artery. The mean period of follow-up is 28 months after aortic graft (range, 3 months to 10 years). Total colonic ischaemia, transient acute tubular necrosis, and duodenal perforation were seen in one child, who needed subtotal colectomy and ileostomy. Another child with an omental patch over the graft had a transient duodenal obstruction, which was managed conservatively. There were no other complications, and 4 of the 5 children are disease-free to date. One child at 10 years after his distal aortic tube graft remained asymptomatic with normal distal blood flow on magnetic resonance angiogram and with normal growth.

High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation in adults with recurrent embryonal tumors of the central nervous system.,Cancer,Cancer,2008-04-01,"Embryonal central nervous system (CNS) tumors (medulloblastoma, cerebral neuroblastoma, pineoblastoma, and primitive neuroectodermal tumors) are rare in adults. Recurrent disease has an extremely poor outcome. The use of high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has demonstrated promising results in children with recurrent disease, but there are only limited data regarding its role in adults. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate adult patients with embryonal CNS tumors who were treated with HDC with ASCT and compare their outcomes with those of patients who received conventional-dose chemotherapy. The authors reviewed the medical records of 23 adult patients (age >or= 18 years) who were treated at the Mayo Clinic for recurrent embryonal CNS tumors between 1976 and 2004. The authors compared treatment with HDC with ASCT (10 patients) with an historic control of patients treated with conventional-dose chemotherapy (nitrosourea based, cisplatin based, or both) (13 patients). HDC with ASCT was associated with increased survival (P= .044) and a longer time to disease progression (TTP) (P= .028). The conventional-dose chemotherapy group had a median TTP of 0.58 years and a median survival of 2.00 years.

Disease control intervals in high-risk neuroblastoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2008-06-01,"Current salvage therapy for recurrent high-risk neuroblastoma is rarely curative. Assessment of the effectiveness of new, primarily cytostatic agents requires the redefinition of study endpoints to reflect disease stabilization rather than tumor response or regression. The intervals of disease control in the patients in the current study with recurrent neuroblastoma were characterized to provide comparison criteria for exploratory studies of new agents. Disease control intervals, disease-free survival, postrecurrence survival, and median time to treatment failure were estimated in 90 patients with high-risk neuroblastoma treated between January 1991 and June 2002 on 3 St. Jude neuroblastoma protocols. The estimated median time to disease recurrence was 18.3 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 15.9-22.4 months) for the first recurrence, 8.7 months (95% CI, 5.0-12.2 months) for the second recurrence, and 3.8 months (95% CI, 2.5-5.4 months) for the third recurrence. The 5-year estimate of survival after the first disease recurrence was 11%+/-4%.

The median disease control interval was approximately halved after each disease recurrence. The previous disease control interval should be considered in stratification schemes for future phase 2 testing of new agents for the treatment of neuroblastoma.

Retrospective case cohort study reviewing charts and imaging of patients with NBL initially diagnosed clinically with WT. Preoperative symptoms, laboratory studies, and imaging were evaluated. Similar variables were assessed in the 20 patients with WT most recently treated at our institution. Nine patients with NBL were identified as those who had an exploratory laparotomy with a preoperative diagnosis of WT; 8 underwent nephrectomy at exploration. Children with NBL had symptoms such as fever and weight loss at presentation (67%) more often than patients with WT (20%). Preoperative computed tomography demonstrated intratumoral calcifications, vascular encasement, or both in 78% of patients with NBL but were never seen in WT patients. Of interest, preoperative urinary catecholamines were elevated in 5 patients ultimately diagnosed with NBL. Although NBL can be mistaken for WT at presentation, the presence of constitutional symptoms, or intratumoral calcification or vascular encasement on preoperative imaging should heighten suspicion for NBL.

Lung metastases in neuroblastoma at initial diagnosis: A report from the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) project.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2008-11-01,"Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial pediatric solid cancer. Lung metastasis is rarely detected in children with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma. We aimed to describe the incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcome of patients with lung metastasis at initial diagnosis using a large international database. The subset of patients from the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group database with INSS stage 4 neuroblastoma and known data regarding lung metastasis at diagnosis was selected for analysis. Clinical and biological characteristics were compared between patients with and without lung metastasis. Survival for patients with and without lung metastasis was estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods. Cox proportional hazards methods were used to determine the independent prognostic value of lung metastasis at diagnosis. Of the 2,808 patients with INSS stage 4 neuroblastoma diagnosed between 1990 and 2002, 100 patients (3.6%) were reported to have lung metastasis at diagnosis. Lung metastasis was more common among patients with MYCN amplified tumors, adrenal primary tumors, or elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (P < 0.02 in each case). Five-year overall survival +/- standard error for patients with lung metastasis was 34.5% +/- 6.8% compared to 44.7% +/- 1.3% for patients without lung metastasis (P = 0.0002). However, in multivariable analysis, the presence of lung metastasis was not independently predictive of outcome.

This tumor is characterized by metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) avidity in 90% of cases, prompting the use of radiolabeled MIBG for targeted radiotherapy in these tumors. The available English language literature was reviewed for original research investigating in vitro, in vivo and clinical applications of radiolabeled MIBG for neuroblastoma. MIBG is actively transported into neuroblastoma cells by the norepinephrine transporter. Preclinical studies demonstrate substantial activity of radiolabeled MIBG in neuroblastoma models, with (131)I-MIBG showing enhanced activity in larger tumors compared to (125)I-MIBG. Clinical studies of (131)I-MIBG in patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma have identified myelosuppression as the main dose-limiting toxicity, necessitating stem cell reinfusion at higher doses.

Activating mutations in ALK provide a therapeutic target in neuroblastoma.,Nature,Nature,2008-10-01,"Neuroblastoma, an embryonal tumour of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system, accounts for approximately 15% of all deaths due to childhood cancer. High-risk neuroblastomas are rapidly progressive; even with intensive myeloablative chemotherapy, relapse is common and almost uniformly fatal. Here we report the detection of previously unknown mutations in the ALK gene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, in 8% of primary neuroblastomas. Five non-synonymous sequence variations were identified in the kinase domain of ALK, of which three were somatic and two were germ line. The most frequent mutation, F1174L, was also identified in three different neuroblastoma cell lines. ALK complementary DNAs encoding the F1174L and R1275Q variants, but not the wild-type ALK cDNA, transformed interleukin-3-dependent murine haematopoietic Ba/F3 cells to cytokine-independent growth. Ba/F3 cells expressing these mutations were sensitive to the small-molecule inhibitor of ALK, TAE684 (ref. 4). Furthermore, two human neuroblastoma cell lines harbouring the F1174L mutation were also sensitive to the inhibitor. Cytotoxicity was associated with increased amounts of apoptosis as measured by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL). Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of ALK expression in neuroblastoma cell lines with the F1174L mutation also resulted in apoptosis and impaired cell proliferation. Thus, activating alleles of the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase are present in primary neuroblastoma tumours and in established neuroblastoma cell lines, and confer sensitivity to ALK inhibition with small molecules, providing a molecular rationale for targeted therapy of this disease.",Journal Article,4129.0,564.0,an embryonal tumour of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system accounts for approximately 15 of all deaths due to childhood cancer High-risk neuroblastomas are rapidly progressive even with intensive myeloablative chemotherapy relapse is common and almost uniformly fatal Here we report the detection of previously unknown mutations in the ALK gene which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase in 8 of primary neuroblastomas Five non-synonymous sequence variations were identified in the kinase domain of ALK of which three were somatic and two were germ line The most frequent mutation F1174L was also identified in three different cell lines ALK complementary DNAs encoding the F1174L and R1275Q variants but not the wild-type ALK cDNA transformed interleukin-3-dependent murine haematopoietic Ba/F3 cells to cytokine-independent growth Ba/F3 cells expressing these mutations were sensitive to the small-molecule inhibitor of ALK TAE684 ref 4 Furthermore two human cell lines harbouring the F1174L mutation were also sensitive to the inhibitor Cytotoxicity was associated with increased amounts of apoptosis as measured by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling TUNEL Short hairpin RNA shRNA -mediated knockdown of ALK expression in cell lines with the F1174L mutation also resulted in apoptosis and impaired cell proliferation Thus activating alleles of the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase are present in primary tumours and in established cell lines and confer sensitivity to ALK inhibition with small molecules providing a molecular rationale for targeted therapy of this disease,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[35, 5239, 770, 1, 3, 672, 11277, 1880, 398, 4162, 9, 705, 167, 1, 62, 1043, 520, 6, 864, 12, 64, 43, 8915, 32, 1755, 1014, 871, 5, 1686, 3246, 56, 429, 16, 186, 2, 2214, 4254, 3034, 467, 21, 414, 3, 638, 1, 373, 860, 138, 4, 3, 1023, 145, 92, 4322, 8, 153, 564, 216, 4, 66, 1, 86, 8915, 365, 220, 9287, 1532, 2293, 11, 108, 4, 3, 216, 1398, 1, 1023, 1, 92, 169, 11, 1119, 2, 100, 11, 2280, 328, 3, 96, 908, 258, 25122, 10, 120, 108, 4, 169, 338, 31, 285, 1023, 3380, 12476, 2362, 3, 25122, 2, 57434, 839, 84, 44, 3, 955, 267, 1023, 4212, 2423, 1603, 27, 470, 1471, 7274, 6669, 6904, 37, 6, 1675, 306, 129, 6669, 6904, 37, 1046, 46, 138, 11, 745, 6, 3, 302, 1354, 230, 1, 1023, 15367, 7357, 39, 798, 100, 171, 31, 285, 10872, 3, 25122, 258, 11, 120, 745, 6, 3, 230, 1408, 10, 41, 5, 101, 4939, 1, 351, 22, 644, 20, 10970, 517, 12716, 9547, 396, 21035, 8159, 978, 5957, 893, 3976, 517, 1563, 1, 1023, 55, 4, 31, 285, 5, 3, 25122, 258, 120, 627, 4, 351, 2, 2364, 31, 457, 631, 1616, 2558, 1, 3, 1023, 153, 564, 216, 32, 364, 4, 86, 1319, 2, 4, 635, 31, 285, 2, 2913, 485, 6, 1023, 297, 5, 302, 1598, 1736, 8, 219, 1728, 9, 238, 36, 1, 26, 34]",1577.0,18923525,264
Exploiting gene expression profiling to identify novel minimal residual disease markers of neuroblastoma.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2008-11-01,"Minimal residual disease (MRD) presents a significant hurdle to curing metastatic neuroblastoma. Biological therapies directed against MRD can improve outcome. Evaluating treatment efficacy requires MRD measurement, which serves as surrogate endpoint. Because of tumor heterogeneity, no single marker will likely be adequate. Genome-wide expression profiling can uncover potential MRD markers differentially expressed in tumors over normal marrow/blood. Gene expression array was carried out on 48 stage 4 tumors and 9 remission marrows using the Affymetrix U95 gene chip. Thirty-four genes with a tumor-to-marrow expression ratio higher than tyrosine hydroxylase were identified. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was done on all 34 genes to study the dynamic range of tumor cell detection and the expression of these genes in normal marrow/blood samples and in stage 4 neuroblastoma tumors. Top ranking markers were then tested for prognostic significance in the marrows of stage 4 patients collected from the same treatment protocol after two cycles of immunotherapy. Based on sensitivity assays, 8 top-ranking markers were identified: CCND1, CRMP1, DDC, GABRB3, ISL1, KIF1A, PHOX2B, and TACC2. They were abundantly expressed in stage IV neuroblastoma tumors (n=20) and had low to no detection in normal marrow/blood samples (n=20). Moreover, expression of CCND1, DDC, GABRB3, ISL1, KIF1A, and PHOX2B in 116 marrows sampled after two treatment cycles was highly prognostic of progression-free and overall survival (P<0.001).

We describe a single centre approach at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC) from 1991 to 2007 that minimises therapy except for those patients with MYCN-amplified NB. In this retrospective analysis of 69 patients, tumour MYCN was not amplified in 53 and amplified in 16. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Fourteen patients with non-MYCN-amplified tumours were treated with surgery alone (group A) and the remaining 39 (group B) with surgery following chemotherapy that was initiated and administered at non-MSKCC institutions. Chemotherapy was discontinued after surgery in 38/39 of the latter. The 10-year EFS and OS for all patients with MYCN-non-amplified NB were 74.9+/-16.9% and 92.6+/-5.5%, respectively. There was no difference in OS between groups A and B (p=0.2; 10-year OS for groups A and B was 84.6+/-14% and 97.1+/-2.9%, respectively). Patients with MYCN-amplified disease (group C) underwent dose-intensive induction, tumour resection and local radiotherapy: 13 achieved complete or very good partial remission, and 10 received myeloablative chemotherapy. 11/16 patients also received 3F8-based immunotherapy: 10 remain free of disease.

IFN-beta sensitizes neuroblastoma to the antitumor activity of temozolomide by modulating O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase expression.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2008-12-03,"Although temozolomide has shown clinical activity against neuroblastoma, this activity is likely limited by the DNA repair enzyme O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). We hypothesized that IFN-beta could sensitize neuroblastoma cells to the cytotoxic effects of temozolomide through its ability to down-regulate MGMT expression. In vitro proliferation of three neuroblastoma cell lines treated with IFN-beta and temozolomide alone or in combination was examined. Antitumor activity was assessed in both localized and disseminated neuroblastoma xenografts using single-agent and combination therapy, with continuous delivery of IFN-beta being established by a liver-targeted adeno-associated virus-mediated approach. Two neuroblastoma cell lines (NB-1691 and SK-N-AS) were found to have high baseline levels of MGMT expression, whereas a third cell line (CHLA-255) had low levels. Temozolomide had little effect on in vitro proliferation of the neuroblastoma cell lines with high MGMT expression, but pretreatment with IFN-beta significantly decreased MGMT expression and cell counts (NB-1691: 36 +/- 3% of control, P = 0.0008; SK-N-AS: 54 +/- 7% control, P = 0.003). In vivo, NB-1691 tumors in CB17-SCID mice treated with the combination of IFN-beta and temozolomide had lower MGMT expression and a significantly reduced tumor burden, both localized [percent initial tumor volume: 2,516 +/- 680% (control) versus 1,272 +/- 330% (temozolomide), P = 0.01; 1,348 +/- 220%, P = 0.03 (IFN-beta); 352 +/- 110%, P = 0.0001 (combo)] and disseminated [bioluminescent signal: control (1.32e10 +/- 6.5e9) versus IFN-beta (2.78e8 +/- 3.09e8), P = 0.025, versus temozolomide (2.06e9 +/- 1.55e9), P = 0.1, versus combination (2.13e7 +/- 7.67e6), P = 0.009].

Methionine depletion with recombinant methioninase: in vitro and in vivo efficacy against neuroblastoma and its synergism with chemotherapeutic drugs.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2009-04-01,"Methionine starvation can modulate gene methylation, cell cycle transition and pathways related to survival following DNA damage. Methionine depletion by recombinant methioninase (rMETase) may have in vitro and in vivo efficacy against neuroblastoma (NB), especially when combined with chemotherapeutic drugs. rMETase from Pseudomonas putida was produced in Escherichia coli and purified by ion-exchange chromatography. rMETase alone inhibited the proliferation of 15/15 NB cell lines in vitro. Among these 15 cell lines, only 66N demonstrated rMETase-induced apoptosis. rMETase alone suppressed LAN-1 and NMB-7 xenografts (p < 0.01) and no toxicities were noted other than reversible weight loss. In vitro efficacy experiments combining rMETase and chemotherapeutic agents were carried out using SK-N-LD and SK-N-BE (1)N established at diagnosis, as well as LAN-1, SK-N-BE (2)C and NMB-7 established at relapse. Microtubule depolymerization agents including vincristine, vinorelbine, vinblatine and mebendazole showed synergism when tested in combination with rMETase in all 5 cell lines. Among DNA damaging agents, synergy with rMETase was observed only in cell lines established at diagnosis and not at relapse. Cell cycle analysis showed that rMETase arrested G2 phase and not M phase. In vivo efficacy experiments using LAN-1 and NMB-7 xenografts showed that rMETase rendered vincristine more effective than vincristine alone in tumor growth suppression (p < 0.001). In conclusion, methionine depletion inhibited NB proliferation and arrested tumor cells at G2 phase. rMETase synergized with microtubule depolymerization agents.

Phase 1 and pharmacokinetic study of concurrent carboplatin and irinotecan in subjects aged 1 to 21 years with refractory solid tumors.,Cancer,Cancer,2009-01-01,"Preclinical testing suggests the combination of carboplatin and irinotecan has at least additive antitumor activity. The primary objectives of the current study were to determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) and recommended phase 2 doses of carboplatin administered with irinotecan to pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors. This was a multicenter, open-label, single-arm dose escalation study in which subjects with refractory solid tumors received 21-day treatment cycles of intravenous carboplatin on Day 1 followed by intravenous irinotecan administered daily for 10 days within 2 consecutive weeks. The plasma pharmacokinetics of ultrafiltrable platinum, irinotecan, and 2 irinotecan metabolites were determined during Cycle 1. The interpatient plan for dose escalation at study initiation was to increase irinotecan first followed by increases in carboplatin. Twenty-eight patients with a median age of 8.5 years (range, 1-21 years) were enrolled with a variety of solid tumors. Two of 6 subjects at the first dose level (carboplatin target area under the curve [AUC], 4.0 mg/mL*min; irinotecan, 18 mg/m2/dose) experienced dose-limiting gastrointestinal toxicities requiring a dose de-escalation scheme (carboplatin AUC, 4.0 mg/mL*min; irinotecan, 15 mg/m2/dose). Three of 6 subjects at the second dose level experienced dose-limiting gastrointestinal complications and bone marrow suppression. A further dose de-escalation to carboplatin AUC of 4.0 mg/mL*min and irinotecan of 12 mg/m2/dose resulted in dose-limiting bone marrow suppression in 1 of 13 patients treated at that dose, and therefore was determined to be the MTD. One complete response (in a patient with medulloblastoma) and 3 partial responses (in patients with neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, and lymphoendothelial carcinoma, respectively) were observed.

Phase I trial of oral irinotecan and temozolomide for children with relapsed high-risk neuroblastoma: a new approach to neuroblastoma therapy consortium study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-01-26,"Irinotecan and temozolomide have single-agent activity and schedule-dependent synergy against neuroblastoma. Because protracted administration of intravenous irinotecan is costly and inconvenient, we sought to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of oral irinotecan combined with temozolomide in children with recurrent/resistant high-risk neuroblastoma. Patients received oral temozolomide on days 1 through 5 combined with oral irinotecan on days 1 through 5 and 8 through 12 in 3-week courses. Daily oral cefixime was used to reduce irinotecan-associated diarrhea. Fourteen assessable patients received 75 courses. Because neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were initially dose-limiting, temozolomide was reduced from 100 to 75 mg/m(2)/d for subsequent patients. Irinotecan was then escalated from 30 to 60 mg/m2/d. First-course grade 3 diarrhea was dose-limiting in one of six patients treated at the irinotecan MTD of 60 mg/m2/d. Other toxicities were mild and reversible. The median SN-38 lactone area under the plasma concentration versus time curve at this dose was 72 ng . hr/mL. One patient with bulky soft tissue disease had a complete response through six courses. Six additional patients received a median of seven courses (range, three to 22 courses) before progression. This all-oral regimen was feasible and well tolerated in heavily pretreated children with resistant neuroblastoma, and seven (50%) of 14 assessable patients had response or disease stabilization for three or more courses in this phase I trial. SN-38 lactone exposures were similar to those reported with protracted intravenous irinotecan.

Sensitivity of surveillance studies for detecting asymptomatic and unsuspected relapse of high-risk neuroblastoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-01-26,"Relapse-free survival (RFS) is a powerful measure of treatment efficacy. We describe the sensitivity of standard surveillance studies for detecting relapse of neuroblastoma (NB). The patients were in complete/very good partial remission of high-risk NB; routine monitoring revealed asymptomatic and, therefore, unsuspected relapses in 113 patients, whereas 41 patients had symptoms prompting urgent evaluations. Assessments every 2 to 4 months included computed tomography, iodine-131-metaiodobenzylguanidine (131)I-MIBG; through November 1999) or iodine-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-MIBG) scan, urine catecholamines, and bone marrow (BM) histology. Bone scan was routine through 2002. (123)I-MIBG scan was the most reliable study for revealing unsuspected relapse; it had an 82% detection rate, which was superior to the rates with (131)I-MIBG scan (64%; P = .1), bone scan (36%; P < .001), and BM histology (34%; P < .001). Among asymptomatic patients, (123)I-MIBG scan was the sole positive study indicating relapse in 25 (27%) of 91 patients compared with one (4.5%) of 22 patients for (131)I-MIBG scan (P = .04) and 0% to 6% of patients for each of the other studies (P < .001). Patients whose monitoring included (123)I-MIBG scan were significantly less likely than patients monitored by (131)I-MIBG scan to have an extensive osteomedullary relapse and had a significantly longer survival from relapse (P < .001) and from diagnosis (P = .002).

Iodine-131--metaiodobenzylguanidine double infusion with autologous stem-cell rescue for neuroblastoma: a new approaches to neuroblastoma therapy phase I study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-01-26,"Iodine-131-metaiodobenzylguanidine ((131)I-MIBG) provides targeted radiotherapy with more than 30% response rate in refractory neuroblastoma, but activity infused is limited by radiation safety and hematologic toxicity. The goal was to determine the maximum-tolerated dose of (131)I-MIBG in two consecutive infusions at a 2-week interval, supported by autologous stem-cell rescue (ASCR) 2 weeks after the second dose. The (131)I-MIBG dose was escalated using a 3 + 3 phase I trial design, with levels calculated by cumulative red marrow radiation index (RMI) from both infusions. Using dosimetry, the second infusion was adjusted to achieve the target RMI, except at level 4, where the second infusion was capped at 21 mCi/kg. Twenty-one patients were enrolled onto the study at levels 1 to 4, with 18 patients assessable for toxicity and 20 patients assessable for response. Cumulative (131)I-MIBG given to achieve the target RMI ranged from 22 to 50 mCi/kg, with cumulative RMI of 3.2 to 8.92 Gy. No patient had a dose-limiting toxicity. Reversible grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity occurred in six patients at level 4, establishing the recommended cumulative dose as 36 mCi/kg. The median time to absolute neutrophil count more than 500/microL after ASCR was 13 days (4 to 27 days) and to platelet independence was 17 days (6 to 47 days). Responses included two partial responses, eight mixed responses, three stable disease, and seven progressive disease. Responses by semiquantitative MIBG score occurred in eight patients, soft tissue responses occurred in five of 11 patients, but bone marrow responses occurred in only two of 13 patients. The lack of toxicity with this approach allowed dramatic dose intensification of (131)I-MIBG, with minimal toxicity and promising activity.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",4012.0,83.0,Iodine-131-metaiodobenzylguanidine 131 I-MIBG provides targeted radiotherapy with more than 30 response rate in refractory but activity infused is limited by radiation safety and hematologic toxicity The goal was to determine the maximum-tolerated dose of 131 I-MIBG in two consecutive infusions at a 2-week interval supported by autologous stem-cell rescue ASCR 2 weeks after the second dose The 131 I-MIBG dose was escalated using a 3 3 phase I trial design with levels calculated by cumulative red marrow radiation index RMI from both infusions Using dosimetry the second infusion was adjusted to achieve the target RMI except at level 4 where the second infusion was capped at 21 mCi/kg Twenty-one patients were enrolled onto the study at levels 1 to 4 with 18 patients assessable for toxicity and 20 patients assessable for response Cumulative 131 I-MIBG given to achieve the target RMI ranged from 22 to 50 mCi/kg with cumulative RMI of 3.2 to 8.92 Gy No patient had a dose-limiting toxicity Reversible grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity occurred in six patients at level 4 establishing the recommended cumulative dose as 36 mCi/kg The median time to absolute neutrophil count more than 500/microL after ASCR was 13 days 4 to 27 days and to platelet independence was 17 days 6 to 47 days Responses included two partial responses eight mixed responses three stable disease and seven progressive disease Responses by semiquantitative MIBG score occurred in eight patients soft tissue responses occurred in five of 11 patients but marrow responses occurred in only two of 13 patients The lack of toxicity with this approach allowed dramatic dose intensification of 131 I-MIBG with minimal toxicity and promising activity,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4287, 2229, 11285, 2229, 70, 3574, 777, 238, 310, 5, 80, 76, 201, 51, 116, 4, 430, 84, 128, 4524, 16, 383, 20, 121, 367, 2, 813, 155, 3, 1326, 10, 6, 223, 3, 689, 421, 61, 1, 2229, 70, 3574, 4, 100, 935, 3435, 28, 8, 18, 647, 268, 2708, 20, 1028, 452, 31, 4256, 10729, 18, 244, 50, 3, 419, 61, 3, 2229, 70, 3574, 61, 10, 2842, 75, 8, 27, 27, 124, 70, 160, 771, 5, 148, 981, 20, 967, 3422, 581, 121, 558, 16938, 29, 110, 3435, 75, 4113, 3, 419, 904, 10, 586, 6, 1359, 3, 283, 16938, 2187, 28, 301, 39, 1257, 3, 419, 904, 10, 19785, 28, 239, 4076, 503, 737, 104, 7, 11, 346, 3301, 3, 45, 28, 148, 14, 6, 39, 5, 203, 7, 3120, 9, 155, 2, 179, 7, 3120, 9, 51, 967, 2229, 70, 3574, 447, 6, 1359, 3, 283, 16938, 1869, 29, 350, 6, 212, 4076, 503, 5, 967, 16938, 1, 27, 18, 6, 66, 937, 381, 77, 69, 42, 8, 61, 817, 155, 2786, 88, 27, 3534, 155, 489, 4, 437, 7, 28, 301, 39, 4431, 3, 793, 967, 61, 22, 511, 4076, 503, 3, 52, 98, 6, 1766, 2595, 1276, 80, 76, 1666, 5128, 50, 10729, 10, 233, 162, 39, 6, 428, 162, 2, 6, 1596, 5773, 10, 269, 162, 49, 6, 662, 162, 253, 159, 100, 450, 253, 659, 1739, 253, 169, 585, 34, 2, 648, 1014, 34, 253, 20, 8942, 3574, 368, 489, 4, 659, 7, 1214, 246, 253, 489, 4, 365, 1, 175, 7, 84, 581, 253, 489, 4, 158, 100, 1, 233, 7, 3, 926, 1, 155, 5, 26, 353, 2313, 3079, 61, 5091, 1, 2229, 70, 3574, 5, 1048, 155, 2, 721, 128]",1720.0,19171714,248
Specific gene expression profiles and chromosomal abnormalities are associated with infant disseminated neuroblastoma.,BMC cancer,BMC Cancer,2009-02-03,"Neuroblastoma (NB) tumours have the highest incidence of spontaneous remission, especially among the stage 4s NB subgroup affecting infants. Clinical distinction of stage 4s from lethal stage 4 can be difficult, but critical for therapeutic decisions. The aim of this study was to investigate chromosomal alterations and differential gene expression amongst infant disseminated NB subgroups. Thirty-five NB tumours from patients diagnosed at < 18 months (25 stage 4 and 10 stage 4s), were evaluated by allelic and gene expression analyses. All stage 4s patients underwent spontaneous remission, only 48% stage 4 patients survived despite combined modality therapy. Stage 4 tumours were 90% near-diploid/tetraploid, 44% MYCN amplified, 77% had 1p LOH (50% 1p36), 23% 11q and/or 14q LOH (27%) and 47% had 17q gain. Stage 4s were 90% near-triploid, none MYCN amplified and LOH was restricted to 11q. Initial comparison analyses between stage 4s and 4 < 12 months tumours revealed distinct gene expression profiles. A significant portion of genes mapped to chromosome 1 (P < 0.0001), 90% with higher expression in stage 4s, and chromosome 11 (P = 0.0054), 91% with higher expression in stage 4. Less definite expression profiles were observed between stage 4s and 4 < 18m, yet, association with chromosomes 1 (P < 0.0001) and 11 (P = 0.005) was maintained. Distinct gene expression profiles but no significant association with specific chromosomal region localization was observed between stage 4s and stage 4 < 18 months without MYCN amplification.

Hyperfractionated low-dose (21 Gy) radiotherapy for cranial skeletal metastases in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2009-05-08,"To present a large experience (73 patients) using a standard radiotherapy (RT) protocol to prevent relapse in cranial sites where measurable metastatic neuroblastoma (NB), an adverse prognostic marker, is common. High-risk NB patients with measurable cranial disease at diagnosis or residual cranial disease after induction therapy had those sites irradiated with hyperfractionated 21 Gy; a brain-sparing technique was used for an extensive field. The patients were grouped according to the response to systemic therapy. Thus, when irradiated, Group 1 patients were in complete remission and Group 2 patients had primary refractory disease. Follow-up was from the start of cranial RT. At 3 years, the 39 Group 1 patients had a progression-free survival rate of 51%; control of cranial disease was 79%. Two relapses involved irradiated cranial sites. Two other patients relapsed in the irradiated cranial sites 6 and 12 months after a systemic relapse. At 3 years, the 34 Group 2 patients had a progression-free survival rate of 33%; control of cranial disease was 52%. Group 2 included 19 patients who had residual cranial (with or without extracranial) disease. The cranial sites showed major (n = 13), minor (n = 2), or no response (n = 4) to RT.

Analysis of GD2/GM2 synthase mRNA as a biomarker for small cell lung cancer.,"Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",Lung Cancer,2009-05-19,"GD2/GM2 synthase is a key enzyme in the synthesis of GD2 and GM2 gangliosides found on the surface of neuroblastoma and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) cells. In neuroblastoma, persistent levels of GD2/GM2 synthase RNA in bone marrow (BM) following therapy portend poorer progression-free and overall survival. We conducted this study to determine if GD2/GM2 synthase RNA could be detected in SCLC cell lines and human tissues, and whether mRNA transcript levels corresponded with disease status. Initially, a pilot study enrolled patients with SCLC to determine the rate of GD2 expression at various points in the patients' disease course. Peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow and tumor tissues were used to measure GD2/GM2 synthase levels. In addition, SCLC cell lines were analyzed for GD2/GM2 synthase expression. Based on data from that initial analysis, a prospective trial was developed enrolling patients with newly diagnosed SCLC and following them serially. GD2/GM2 synthase transcript was determined by a sensitive quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay and normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Six SCLC cell lines were assayed for expression of GD2/GM2 synthase, and high expression was detected in all. GD2/GM2 synthase transcript levels were obtained from tumor tissue, BM, or PB of 29 patients in the pilot study. 6/10 (60%) tumor tissues or BM samples were positive (median 332.7 units; range 13-2323 units); 8/19 (42%) untreated patients were GD2/GM2 synthase positive in their PB prior to beginning therapy (median 10.2; range 5.1-32.2); 3/4 (75%) patients who were first tested when they developed recurrent disease were positive in their PB (median 16.1; range 8.5-19.9). The fourth patient had an initial value of 2.0 (negative), which increased to 8.4 (positive) within 1 month without treatment. Seven of 12 patients with baseline positive GD2/GM2 synthase values had post-treatment levels measured, all of which were </=5 or showed a >50% decrease following successful treatment. Patients in the prospective trial demonstrated lower rates of positivity, with only 3/26 (12%) patients exhibiting detectable transcript levels in the peripheral blood prior to treatment. All 3 of these patients had their transcript levels fall below 5 after treatment. 11/26 patients had baseline levels of zero. Bone marrow was drawn at baseline on 7 patients in the prospective trial and 3 (43%) had transcript levels above 5 (range 0.65-27.43 units). There was no correlation between elevated levels in the BM and elevated levels in the PB. Although initial studies demonstrated that GD2/GM2 synthase transcripts were measurable in the peripheral blood of SCLC patients at diagnosis and declined with successful treatment, in a separate prospective study, these results could not be confirmed.

MicroRNA miR-29 modulates expression of immunoinhibitory molecule B7-H3: potential implications for immune based therapy of human solid tumors.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2009-07-07,"B7-H3, a surface immunomodulatory glycoprotein, inhibits natural killer cells and T cells. The monoclonal antibody (mAb) 8H9 is specific for 4Ig-B7-H3, the long and principal form of B7-H3. Early results from radioimmunotherapy using 8H9 have shown promise in patients with metastatic solid tumors to the central nervous system. Whereas B7-H3 transcript was ubiquitously expressed in a wide spectrum of human solid tumors as well as human normal tissues, B7-H3 protein was preferentially expressed only in tumor tissues. By quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, all three isoforms of microRNA miR-29 (a, b, and c) were highly expressed in normal tissues. However, they were down-regulated in a broad spectrum of solid tumors, including neuroblastoma, sarcomas, brain tumors, and tumor cell lines. B7-H3 protein expression was inversely correlated with miR-29 levels in both cell lines and tumor tissues tested. Using luciferase reporter assay, miR-29a was shown to directly target B7-H3 3' untranslated region, and knock-in and knockdown of miR-29a led to down-regulation and up-regulation, respectively, of B7-H3 protein expression. The ability of miR-29 to control B7-H3 protein expression has implications in immune escape by solid tumors.

Long-term outcomes in survivors of neuroblastoma: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2009-07-31,"The 5-year survival rate for individuals with neuroblastoma is approaching 70%. Few data exist, however, on the long-term outcomes of these patients, who are often treated at a very young age. Outcome data were obtained for 954 5-year neuroblastoma survivors who were diagnosed in 1970-1986 and enrolled in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS). Late mortality, second malignant neoplasms, and chronic health conditions were analyzed in relation to treatment factors using Poisson regression models and their modification with generalized estimating equations. Neuroblastoma survivors were compared with a cohort of 3899 siblings of CCSS participants for risk of chronic health conditions and selected sociodemographic outcomes. All statistical tests were two-sided. Six percent of patients died more than 5 years after their diagnosis (standardized mortality ratio = 5.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.4 to 6.9). The most common causes of death were disease recurrence (n = 43) and second malignant neoplasms (n = 13). The cumulative incidence of second malignant neoplasms was 3.5% at 25 years and 7.0% at 30 years after diagnosis. Compared with the sibling cohort, survivors had an increased risk of selected chronic health conditions (risk ratio [RR] = 8.3; 95% CI = 7.1 to 9.7) with a 20-year cumulative incidence of 41.1%. The most prevalent outcomes involved the neurological, sensory, endocrine, and musculoskeletal systems, with 20-year cumulative incidences of 29.8%, 8.6%, 8.3%, and 7.8%, respectively.

We conducted a retrospective review to identify factors that might predict for locoregional tumor control and its impact on overall survival. Between July 2000 through August 2006, a total of 44 pediatric patients with NB received radiation therapy (RT) with curative intent using computed tomography (CT)-based treatment planning. The median age was 3.4 years and the median cumulative dose was 23.4 Gy. Overall survival and locoregional tumor control were measured from the start of RT to the date of death or event as determined by CT/magnetic resonance imaging/meta-iodobenzylguanidine. The influence of age at irradiation, gender, race, cumulative radiation dose, International Neuroblastoma Staging System stage, treatment protocol and resection status was determined with respect to locoregional tumor control. With a median follow-up of 34 months +/- 21 months, locoregional tumor progression was observed in 11 (25%) and was evenly divided between primary site and adjacent nodal/visceral site failure. The influence of locoregional control reached borderline statistical significance (p = 0.06).

Abdominal CT scans of 31 patients with intraabdominal neuroblastoma (stage II-IV), treated with RT (20 IORT+/-EBRT, 11 EBRT alone), were analyzed retrospectively. The diameter of the abdominal aorta was measured before and after RT. These data were compared to normal and predicted normal aortic diameters of children, according to the model of Fitzgerald, Donaldson and Poznanski (aortic diameter in centimeters = 0.844 + 0.0599 x age in years), and to the diameters of a control group of children who had not undergone RT. Statistical analyses for the primary aims were performed using the chi-squared test, t-test, Mann-Whitney test, nonparametric Wilcoxon matched-pairs test and analysis of variance for repeated measures. Clinical files and imaging studies were evaluated for signs of late vascular complications of neuroblastoma patients who had received RT. The mean diameter before and after RT and the growth of the aorta were significantly lower than expected in patients with neuroblastoma (P<0.05 for each) and when compared to the growth in a control group with normal and nonirradiated aortas.

Interferon-gamma-dependent infiltration of human T cells into neuroblastoma tumors in vivo.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2009-10-13,"To investigate the impact of interferon-gamma-mediated upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class I expression on tumor-specific T-cell cytotoxicity and T-cell trafficking into neuroblastoma tumors in vivo. Restoration of major histocompatibility complex class I expression by interferon-gamma treatment enhances killing of neuroblastoma cells. To understand the potential of this approach in vivo, we developed a novel model of neuroblastoma in which NOD/scid/IL2R gamma(null) immunodeficient mice are engrafted with both human T cells and tumor cells. Here, we show enhanced killing of neuroblastoma cells by patient-derived, tumor-specific T cells in vitro. In addition, interferon-gamma treatment in vivo induces efficient upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class I expression on neuroblastoma tumor cells, and this is accompanied by significantly enhanced infiltration of T cells into the tumor. In a pilot clinical trial in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma, we similarly observed augmented T-cell trafficking into neuroblastoma nests in tumor biopsy specimens obtained from patients after 5 days of systemic interferon-gamma therapy.

We evaluated the addition of compartmental intrathecal antibody-based radioimmunotherapy (cRIT) in patients with recurrent metastatic central nervous system (CNS) neuroblastoma following surgery, craniospinal irradiation, and chemotherapy. Twenty one patients treated for recurrent neuroblastoma metastatic to the CNS, received a cRIT-containing salvage regimen incorporating intrathecal (131)I-monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) targeting GD2 or B7H3 following surgery and radiation. Most patients also received outpatient craniospinal irradiation, 3F8/GMCSF immunotherapy, 13-cis-retinoic acid and oral temozolomide for systemic control. Seventeen of 21 cRIT-salvage patients are alive 7-74 months (median 33 months) since CNS relapse, with all 17 remaining free of CNS neuroblastoma. One patient died of infection at 22 months with no evidence of disease at autopsy, and one of lung and bone marrow metastases at 15 months, and one of progressive bone marrow disease at 30 months. The cRIT-salvage regimen was well tolerated, notable for myelosuppression minimized by stem cell support (n = 5), and biochemical hypothyroidism (n = 5). One patient with a 7-year history of metastatic neuroblastoma is in remission from MLL-associated secondary leukemia. This is significantly improved to published results with non-cRIT based where relapsed CNS NB has a median time to death of approximately 6 months.

We hypothesized that patients with a ""missing ligand"" KIR-HLA compound genotype may uniquely benefit from autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). One hundred sixty-nine patients treated with autologous HSCT for stage IV neuroblastoma underwent KIR and HLA genotyping. Patients were segregated according to the presence or absence of HLA ligands for autologous inhibitory KIR. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done for overall and progression-free survival. Sixty-four percent of patients lacked one or more HLA ligands for inhibitory KIR. Patients lacking a HLA ligand had a 46% lower risk of death [hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.35-0.85; P = 0.007] and a 34% lower risk of progression (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44-1.0; P = 0.047) at 3 years compared with patients who possessed all ligands for his/her inhibitory KIR.

High Frequency of p53/MDM2/p14ARF Pathway Abnormalities in Relapsed Neuroblastoma.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2010-02-09,"Most neuroblastomas initially respond to therapy but many relapse with chemoresistant disease. p53 mutations are rare in diagnostic neuroblastomas, but we have previously reported inactivation of the p53/MDM2/p14(ARF) pathway in 9 of 17 (53%) neuroblastoma cell lines established at relapse. Inactivation of the p53/MDM2/p14(ARF) pathway develops during treatment and contributes to neuroblastoma relapse. Eighty-four neuroblastomas were studied from 41 patients with relapsed neuroblastoma including 38 paired neuroblastomas at different stages of therapy. p53 mutations were detected by automated sequencing, p14(ARF) methylation and deletion by methylation-specific PCR and duplex PCR, respectively, and MDM2 amplification by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Abnormalities in the p53 pathway were identified in 20 of 41 (49%) cases. Downstream defects due to inactivating missense p53 mutations were identified in 6 of 41 (15%) cases, 5 following chemotherapy and/or at relapse and 1 at diagnosis, postchemotherapy, and relapse. The presence of a p53 mutation was independently prognostic for overall survival (hazard ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-9.9; P = 0.02). Upstream defects were present in 35% of cases: MDM2 amplification in 3 cases, all at diagnosis and relapse and p14(ARF) inactivation in 12 of 41 (29%) cases: 3 had p14(ARF) methylation, 2 after chemotherapy, and 9 had homozygous deletions, 8 at diagnosis and relapse. These results show that a high proportion of neuroblastomas which relapse have an abnormality in the p53 pathway.

Anti-GD2 antibody therapy for GD2-expressing tumors.,Current cancer drug targets,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,2010-03-01,"In the development of novel immune therapies for high-risk cancers, one goal is to find tumor targets that are not widely shared by normal cells. One such target is the surface disialoganglioside GD2. This antigen is expressed on the surface of a variety of tumors for which no curative therapies exist for patients with advanced disease. In childhood, the most common GD2-expressing tumor is neuroblastoma. GD2 is also expressed on several other high-risk tumors, including those of neuroectodermal or epithelial origin, virtually all melanomas, and approximately 50% of tumor samples from osteosarcoma and soft-tissue sarcomas. Because of the tumor-selective expression of this molecule, it is an attractive target for tumor-specific therapies such as antibody therapy. Over the last 2 decades, several anti-GD2 antibodies have been developed. To reduce both the toxicity of the antibody and the development of human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA), research efforts have primarily focused on exploring anti-GD2 antibodies that have progressively more human elements while at the same time reducing the mouse components.

A retrospective query identified 29 children with NB treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center since 1987 who received RT for CNS relapse. At CNS relapse, 16 patients received CSI (median dose, 2160cGy), and 13 received focal RT. Of those who underwent CSI, 14 (88%) received intra-Ommaya (IO) radioimmunotherapy (RIT); one patient in the non-CSI cohort received IO-RIT. Patient characteristics were similar between the groups. Time to CNS relapse was 20 and 17 months for the CSI and non-CSI cohorts, respectively. At a median follow-up of 28 months, 12 patients (75%) in the CSI group are alive without CNS disease, including two patients with isolated skeletal relapse. Another patient is alive without disease after a brain relapse was retreated with RT. Three patients died-one with no NB at autopsy, one of CNS disease, and one of systemic disease. The two patients who died of NB did not receive IO-RIT. All 13 patients in the non-CSI cohort died at a median of 8.8 months.

Neuroblastoma: Therapeutic strategies for a clinical enigma.,Cancer treatment reviews,Cancer Treat. Rev.,2010-03-12,"Neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial pediatric solid tumor remains a clinical enigma with outcomes ranging from cure in >90% of patients with locoregional tumors with little to no cytotoxic therapy, to <30% for those >18months of age at diagnosis with metastatic disease despite aggressive multimodality therapy. Age, stage and amplification of the MYCN oncogene are the most validated prognostic markers. Recent research has shed light on the biology of neuroblastoma allowing more accurate stratification of patients which has permitted reducing or withholding cytotoxic therapy without affecting outcome for low-risk patients. However, for children with high-risk disease, the development of newer therapeutic strategies is necessary. Current surgery and radiotherapy techniques in conjunction with induction chemotherapy have greatly reduced the risk of local relapse. However, refractory or recurrent osteomedullary disease occurs in most patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. Toxicity limits for high-dose chemotherapy appear to have been reached without further clinical benefit. Neuroblastoma is the first pediatric cancer for which monoclonal-antibody-based immunotherapy has been shown to be effective, particularly for metastatic osteomedullary disease. Radioimmunotherapy appears to be a critical component of a recent, successful regimen for treating patients who relapse in the central nervous system, a possible sanctuary site. Efforts are under way to refine and enhance antibody-based immunotherapy and to determine its optimal use. The identification of newer tumor targets and the harnessing of cell-mediated immunotherapy may generate novel therapeutic approaches. It is likely that a combination of therapeutic modalities will be required to improve survival and cure rates.",Journal Article,3602.0,124.0,the most common extracranial pediatric solid tumor remains a clinical enigma with outcomes ranging from cure in 90 of patients with locoregional tumors with little to no cytotoxic therapy to 30 for those 18months of age at diagnosis with metastatic disease despite aggressive multimodality therapy Age stage and amplification of the MYCN oncogene are the most validated prognostic markers Recent research has shed light on the biology of allowing more accurate stratification of patients which has permitted reducing or withholding cytotoxic therapy without affecting outcome for low-risk patients However for children with high-risk disease the development of newer therapeutic strategies is necessary Current surgery and radiotherapy techniques in conjunction with induction chemotherapy have greatly reduced the risk of local relapse However refractory or recurrent osteomedullary disease occurs in most patients with high-risk Toxicity limits for high-dose chemotherapy appear to have been reached without further clinical benefit is the first pediatric cancer for which monoclonal-antibody-based immunotherapy has been shown to be effective particularly for metastatic osteomedullary disease Radioimmunotherapy appears to be a critical component of a recent successful regimen for treating patients who relapse in the central nervous system a possible sanctuary site Efforts are under way to refine and enhance antibody-based immunotherapy and to determine its optimal use The identification of newer tumor targets and the harnessing of cell-mediated immunotherapy may generate novel therapeutic approaches It is likely that a combination of therapeutic modalities will be required to improve survival and cure rates,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 96, 186, 4202, 815, 537, 30, 469, 8, 38, 19048, 5, 123, 2223, 29, 1722, 4, 424, 1, 7, 5, 1325, 57, 5, 1215, 6, 77, 759, 36, 6, 201, 9, 135, 26922, 1, 89, 28, 147, 5, 113, 34, 550, 571, 2425, 36, 89, 82, 2, 1073, 1, 3, 4068, 1836, 32, 3, 96, 938, 177, 525, 435, 389, 71, 5816, 1691, 23, 3, 891, 1, 2952, 80, 1481, 1541, 1, 7, 92, 71, 5449, 1818, 15, 16673, 759, 36, 187, 2319, 228, 9, 154, 43, 7, 137, 9, 541, 5, 64, 43, 34, 3, 193, 1, 2246, 189, 422, 16, 1493, 291, 152, 2, 310, 1092, 4, 3357, 5, 504, 56, 47, 3510, 405, 3, 43, 1, 293, 429, 137, 430, 15, 387, 22489, 34, 1780, 4, 96, 7, 5, 64, 43, 155, 3526, 9, 64, 61, 56, 1322, 6, 47, 85, 1300, 187, 195, 38, 247, 16, 3, 157, 815, 12, 9, 92, 848, 548, 90, 726, 71, 85, 443, 6, 40, 323, 823, 9, 113, 22489, 34, 5862, 1233, 6, 40, 8, 740, 1249, 1, 8, 435, 1401, 477, 9, 1367, 7, 54, 429, 4, 3, 854, 1880, 398, 8, 899, 14541, 606, 1413, 32, 669, 2255, 6, 5003, 2, 1304, 548, 90, 726, 2, 6, 223, 211, 665, 119, 3, 911, 1, 2246, 30, 637, 2, 3, 12150, 1, 31, 517, 726, 68, 2562, 229, 189, 611, 192, 16, 322, 17, 8, 150, 1, 189, 1558, 303, 40, 616, 6, 401, 25, 2, 1722, 151]",1721.0,20227189,63

We reviewed the records of 63 patients with newly diagnosed metastatic neuroblastoma treated at our institution (1989-2001) to investigate their characteristics at presentation, dose and field of RT, treatment response, and failure patterns. Seventeen patients received RT, and 46 did not. In the RT group, a greater percentage of patients had residual disease before consolidation than did those in the no-RT group (88.2% vs 69.6%, P = .008). Gross total resection was achieved less often in the RT group (65% vs 89%, P = .055), but the 5-year cumulative incidences of local failure were similar (35.3% +/- 12.4% vs 32.6% +/- 7.1%).

We provide a perspective on the incorporation of these drugs into therapy for neuroblastoma. The reader will gain a better understanding of these novel agents and their targets in neuroblastoma. The reader will also gain insight into the need to define through sequential, carefully designed clinical trials, the roles and toxicities of these therapies, especially if the combination of targeted and conventional cytotoxic agents is used.

Epigenetic alterations differ in phenotypically distinct human neuroblastoma cell lines.,BMC cancer,BMC Cancer,2010-06-14,"Epigenetic aberrations and a CpG island methylator phenotype have been shown to be associated with poor outcomes in children with neuroblastoma (NB). Seven cancer related genes (THBS-1, CASP8, HIN-1, TIG-1, BLU, SPARC, and HIC-1) that have been shown to have epigenetic changes in adult cancers and play important roles in the regulation of angiogenesis, tumor growth, and apoptosis were analyzed to investigate the role epigenetic alterations play in determining NB phenotype. Two NB cell lines (tumorigenic LA1-55n and non-tumorigenic LA1-5s) that differ in their ability to form colonies in soft agar and tumors in nude mice were used. Quantitative RNA expression analyses were performed on seven genes in LA1-5s, LA1-55n and 5-Aza-dC treated LA1-55n NB cell lines. The methylation status around THBS-1, HIN-1, TIG-1 and CASP8 promoters was examined using methylation specific PCR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was used to examine histone modifications along the THBS-1 promoter. Luciferase assay was used to determine THBS-1 promoter activity. Cell proliferation assay was used to examine the effect of 5-Aza-dC on NB cell growth. The soft agar assay was used to determine the tumorigenicity. Promoter methylation values for THBS-1, HIN-1, TIG-1, and CASP8 were higher in LA1-55n cells compared to LA1-5s cells. Consistent with the promoter methylation status, lower levels of gene expression were detected in the LA1-55n cells. Histone marks associated with repressive chromatin states (H3K9Me3, H3K27Me3, and H3K4Me3) were identified in the THBS-1 promoter region in the LA1-55n cells, but not the LA1-5s cells. In contrast, the three histone codes associated with an active chromatin state (acetyl H3, acetyl H4, and H3K4Me3) were present in the THBS-1 promoter region in LA1-5s cells, but not the LA1-55n cells, suggesting that an accessible chromatin structure is important for THBS-1 expression. We also show that 5-Aza-dC treatment of LA1-55n cells alters the DNA methylation status and the histone code in the THBS-1 promoter modifies cell morphology, and inhibits their ability to form colonies in soft agar.

Genetic alterations in the RAS/RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathways in the follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-06-01,"The follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC) is the second most common histotype among papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs). Although the prognosis of FVPTC is similar to the conventional phenotype, differential diagnostic difficulties may not be uncommon with other follicular thyroid neoplasms, and little is known about their genetic alterations. Defining these alterations may lead to the identification of diagnostic and biologic markers. In this study, the authors evaluated genetic alterations and downstream-activated signals of the Ras/Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene (Akt) (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathways in 30 FVPTC tissue specimens. Tumors and matched normal thyroid samples were tested for RAS, for the v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene (BRAF) substitution of valine (V) for glutamate (E) at codon 600 (the V600E mutation), for phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), for catalytic PI3k p110 subunit alpha (PIK3CA), for AKT, and for the presence of rearranged during transfection (ret) proto-oncogene/PTC (RET-PTC) and paired box-8 (PAX8)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) fusion protein (PAX8-PPARgamma) rearrangements by direct sequencing and reverse transcriptase-polymerases chain reaction analyses, respectively. Western blot analysis was used to assess the effects of these gene abnormalities on the activation of the 2 pathways. Genetic alterations were identified in 70% of FVPTCs. Activation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways was observed in 74% and 22% of tumors, respectively. The alterations that were identified in the genes of the 2 pathways were mutually exclusive. Chromosomal RET-PTC and PAX8-PPARgamma rearrangements were observed in 20% and 17% of tumors, respectively. It was noteworthy that some FVPTCs with RET-PTC had the coactivation of both pathways. RET-PTC and PAX8-PPARgamma rearrangements and mutations of the neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog N-RAS at codon 61 were the most common genetic alterations in FVPTCs. Activation of the MAPK pathway was a frequent event in FVPTCs, and the PI3K signaling pathway could be coactivated in RET-PTC tumors. These findings may have important therapeutic implication in patients with FVPTC.",Journal Article,3521.0,62.0,The follicular variant of papillary carcinoma FVPTC is the second most common histotype among papillary cancers PTCs Although the prognosis of FVPTC is similar to the conventional phenotype differential diagnostic difficulties may not be uncommon with other follicular neoplasms and little is known about their genetic alterations Defining these alterations may lead to the identification of diagnostic and biologic markers In this study the authors evaluated genetic alterations and downstream-activated signals of the Ras/Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase PI3K /v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene Akt PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in 30 FVPTC tissue specimens Tumors and matched normal samples were tested for RAS for the v-raf murine viral oncogene BRAF substitution of valine V for glutamate E at codon 600 the V600E mutation for phosphatase and tensin homolog PTEN for catalytic PI3k p110 subunit alpha PIK3CA for AKT and for the presence of rearranged during transfection ret proto-oncogene/PTC RET-PTC and paired box-8 PAX8 /peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma PPARgamma fusion protein PAX8-PPARgamma rearrangements by direct sequencing and reverse transcriptase-polymerases chain reaction analyses respectively Western blot analysis was used to assess the effects of these gene abnormalities on the activation of the 2 pathways Genetic alterations were identified in 70 of FVPTCs Activation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways was observed in 74 and 22 of tumors respectively The alterations that were identified in the genes of the 2 pathways were mutually exclusive Chromosomal RET-PTC and PAX8-PPARgamma rearrangements were observed in 20 and 17 of tumors respectively It was noteworthy that some FVPTCs with RET-PTC had the coactivation of both pathways RET-PTC and PAX8-PPARgamma rearrangements and mutations of the RAS viral oncogene homolog N-RAS at codon 61 were the most common genetic alterations in FVPTCs Activation of the MAPK pathway was a frequent event in FVPTCs and the PI3K signaling pathway could be coactivated in RET-PTC tumors These findings may have important therapeutic implication in patients with FVPTC,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[3, 1974, 1142, 1, 1796, 134, 21204, 16, 3, 419, 96, 186, 16958, 107, 1796, 163, 17815, 242, 3, 356, 1, 21204, 16, 288, 6, 3, 809, 1005, 1777, 752, 4679, 68, 44, 40, 2052, 5, 127, 1974, 1179, 2, 1215, 16, 440, 545, 136, 336, 593, 2847, 46, 593, 68, 1122, 6, 3, 911, 1, 752, 2, 1283, 525, 4, 26, 45, 3, 738, 194, 336, 593, 2, 1489, 735, 2312, 1, 3, 1102, 2212, 2625, 735, 178, 216, 1748, 2, 3415, 27, 216, 974, 603, 649, 1471, 5070, 1667, 1836, 649, 974, 649, 314, 460, 4, 201, 21204, 246, 623, 57, 2, 655, 295, 347, 11, 650, 9, 1102, 9, 3, 603, 2212, 1471, 1667, 1836, 566, 5029, 1, 12255, 603, 9, 8334, 563, 28, 3673, 2383, 3, 2047, 258, 9, 2577, 2, 6111, 3412, 820, 9, 4784, 974, 23068, 3350, 950, 1506, 9, 649, 2, 9, 3, 463, 1, 3201, 190, 3789, 2412, 4976, 1836, 3748, 2412, 3748, 2, 2355, 4971, 66, 8958, 8659, 8660, 735, 153, 1705, 4799, 1212, 178, 8958, 4799, 2072, 20, 1196, 615, 2, 1772, 4456, 19699, 1260, 1329, 318, 106, 1521, 2639, 65, 10, 95, 6, 423, 3, 176, 1, 46, 145, 1171, 23, 3, 363, 1, 3, 18, 460, 336, 593, 11, 108, 4, 431, 1, 34929, 363, 1, 3, 1748, 2, 974, 460, 10, 164, 4, 794, 2, 350, 1, 57, 106, 3, 593, 17, 11, 108, 4, 3, 214, 1, 3, 18, 460, 11, 5575, 4804, 1860, 2412, 3748, 2, 8958, 4799, 2072, 11, 164, 4, 179, 2, 269, 1, 57, 106, 192, 10, 9559, 17, 476, 34929, 5, 2412, 3748, 42, 3, 26724, 1, 110, 460, 2412, 3748, 2, 8958, 4799, 2072, 2, 138, 1, 3, 1102, 1667, 1836, 3412, 78, 1102, 28, 3673, 713, 11, 3, 96, 186, 336, 593, 4, 34929, 363, 1, 3, 1748, 308, 10, 8, 908, 774, 4, 34929, 2, 3, 974, 314, 308, 359, 40, 34339, 4, 2412, 3748, 57, 46, 272, 68, 47, 305, 189, 8969, 4, 7, 5, 21204]",2185.0,20564403,32
"Differential impact of high-dose cyclophosphamide, topotecan, and vincristine in clinical subsets of patients with chemoresistant neuroblastoma.",Cancer,Cancer,2010-06-01,"In what to the authors' knowledge is the first such study for a pediatric cancer, a large database was retrospectively analyzed to assess statistically the likelihood of response to a given salvage therapy in different clinical subsets of patients. Treatment was comprised of high-dose cyclophosphamide (at a dose of 140 mg/kg), topotecan (at a dose of 8 mg/m(2)), and vincristine (at a dose of 0.067 mg/kg or 2 mg/m(2), whichever was lower; maximum dose, 2 mg) (HD-CTV). The Fisher exact test was used for comparisons of response rates among standard subsets of patients (n = 126) with refractory or recurrent neuroblastoma (NB). Among children, major (ie, complete/partial) responses occurred in 11 of 58 (19%) with primary refractory NB, 4 of 14 (29%) with secondary refractory NB, 13 of 25 (52%) with a new (first) disease recurrence, and none of 13 patients with progressive disease (PD) while receiving therapy. Other children had mixed responses (MRs); when combining major responses and MRs, anti-NB activity was noted in 26 of 58 (45%) children with primary refractory NB, 10 of 14 (71%) children with secondary refractory NB, 20 of 25 (80%) children with a new (first) disease recurrence, and 1 of 13 (8%) children with PD while receiving therapy. The response rate was significantly different across the 4 groups of children for both major responses (P = .003) and combined responses (P = .001). All 10 adolescents/adults treated for primary refractory NB had no response, which was a significantly inferior result compared with the response rate of 45% noted in children with primary refractory NB (P = .008).

Phase I study of decitabine with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in children with neuroblastoma and other solid tumors: a Children's Oncology Group study.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2010-10-01,"Demethylating agents may alter the expression of genes involved in chemotherapy resistance. We conducted a phase I trial to determine the toxicity and molecular effects of the demethylating agent, decitabine, followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in children with refractory solid tumors. Stratum A included children with any solid tumor; Stratum B included neuroblastoma patients only. Patients received a 1-hr decitabine infusion for 7 days, followed by doxorubicin (45 mg/m(2)) and cyclophosphamide (1 g/m(2)) on day 7. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed after the first dose of decitabine. Biological studies included methylation and gene expression analyses of caspase-8, MAGE-1 and fetal hemoglobin (HbF), and expression profiling of pre- and post-treatment peripheral blood and bone marrow cells. The maximum-tolerated dose of decitabine was 5 mg/m(2)/day for 7 days. Dose-limiting toxicities at 10 mg/m(2)/day were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Decitabine exhibited rapid clearance from plasma. Three of 9 patients in Stratum A and 4/12 patients in Stratum B had stable disease for > or = 4 months. Sustained MAGE-1 demethylation and increased HbF expression were observed in the majority of patients post-treatment (12/20 and 14/16, respectively). Caspase-8 promoter demethylation and gene expression were seen in 2/7 bone marrow samples. Differentially expressed genes were identified by microarray analysis. Low-dose decitabine when combined with doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide has tolerable toxicity in children. However, doses of decitabine capable of producing clinically relevant biologic effects were not well tolerated with this combination. Alternative strategies of combining demethylating agents with non-cytotoxic, biologically targeted agents such as histone deacetylase inhibitors should be explored.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",3399.0,41.0,Demethylating agents may alter the expression of genes involved in chemotherapy resistance We conducted a phase I trial to determine the toxicity and molecular effects of the demethylating agent decitabine followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in children with refractory solid tumors Stratum A included children with any solid tumor Stratum B included patients only Patients received a 1-hr decitabine infusion for 7 days followed by doxorubicin 45 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide 1 g/m 2 on day 7 Pharmacokinetic studies were performed after the first dose of decitabine Biological studies included methylation and gene expression analyses of caspase-8 MAGE-1 and fetal hemoglobin HbF and expression profiling of pre- and post-treatment peripheral blood and marrow cells The maximum-tolerated dose of decitabine was 5 mg/m 2 /day for 7 days Dose-limiting toxicities at 10 mg/m 2 /day were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia Decitabine exhibited rapid clearance from plasma Three of 9 patients in Stratum A and 4/12 patients in Stratum B had stable disease for or 4 months Sustained MAGE-1 demethylation and increased HbF expression were observed in the majority of patients post-treatment 12/20 and 14/16 respectively Caspase-8 promoter demethylation and gene expression were seen in 2/7 marrow samples Differentially expressed genes were identified by microarray analysis Low-dose decitabine when combined with doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide has tolerable toxicity in children However doses of decitabine capable of producing clinically relevant biologic effects were not well tolerated with this combination Alternative strategies of combining demethylating agents with non-cytotoxic biologically targeted agents such as histone deacetylase inhibitors should be explored,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[8399, 183, 68, 2688, 3, 55, 1, 214, 646, 4, 56, 251, 21, 426, 8, 124, 70, 160, 6, 223, 3, 155, 2, 219, 176, 1, 3, 8399, 420, 3004, 370, 20, 856, 2, 1112, 4, 541, 5, 430, 537, 57, 4897, 8, 159, 541, 5, 500, 537, 30, 4897, 132, 159, 7, 158, 7, 103, 8, 14, 168, 3004, 904, 9, 67, 162, 370, 20, 856, 512, 81, 188, 18, 2, 1112, 14, 499, 188, 18, 23, 218, 67, 1456, 94, 11, 173, 50, 3, 157, 61, 1, 3004, 1037, 94, 159, 569, 2, 145, 55, 318, 1, 1469, 66, 4871, 14, 2, 6698, 2222, 23847, 2, 55, 1080, 1, 671, 2, 539, 24, 672, 315, 2, 581, 37, 3, 689, 421, 61, 1, 3004, 10, 33, 81, 188, 18, 218, 9, 67, 162, 61, 817, 385, 28, 79, 81, 188, 18, 218, 11, 778, 2, 1340, 3004, 1416, 1321, 1960, 29, 554, 169, 1, 83, 7, 4, 4897, 8, 2, 39, 133, 7, 4, 4897, 132, 42, 585, 34, 9, 15, 39, 53, 2275, 4871, 14, 6800, 2, 101, 23847, 55, 11, 164, 4, 3, 686, 1, 7, 539, 24, 133, 179, 2, 213, 245, 106, 1469, 66, 973, 6800, 2, 145, 55, 11, 527, 4, 18, 67, 581, 347, 2478, 570, 214, 11, 108, 20, 1727, 65, 154, 61, 3004, 198, 397, 5, 856, 1112, 71, 2668, 155, 4, 541, 137, 415, 1, 3004, 2787, 1, 3787, 505, 867, 1283, 176, 11, 44, 149, 421, 5, 26, 150, 1091, 422, 1, 1525, 8399, 183, 5, 220, 759, 2665, 238, 183, 225, 22, 1508, 2732, 222, 257, 40, 1443]",1773.0,20589651,16
Pediatric phase I trial and pharmacokinetic study of vorinostat: a Children's Oncology Group phase I consortium report.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2010-07-06,"The purpose of this study was to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), and pharmacokinetics of vorinostat administered as a single agent and in combination 13-cis retinoic acid (13cRA) in children with refractory solid tumors; to evaluate the tolerability of the solid tumor MTD in children with refractory leukemias; and to characterize the pharmacokinetics of a vorinostat suspension in children. Vorinostat was administered orally daily starting at 180 mg/m(2)/d with escalations planned in 30% increments. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed with the initial dose. Acetyl-histone (H3) accumulation was assessed by Western blotting of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Sixty-four patients were enrolled on this multipart trial. In patients with solid tumors, the MTD was 230 mg/m(2)/d with dose-limiting neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and hypokalemia at 300 mg/m(2)/d. DLTs observed with the combination of 13cRA and vorinostat included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anorexia, and hypertriglyceridemia, resulting in a MTD of vorinostat 180 mg/m(2)/d 4 times per week and 13cRA 80 mg/m(2)/dose twice per day, days 1 through 14 every 28 days. Wide interpatient variability was noted in vorinostat disposition, with area under the concentration-time curves at 230 mg/m(2)/d for the capsule (range, 1,415 to 9,291 ng/mL x hr) and oral suspension (range, 1,186 to 4,780 ng/mL x hr). Significant accumulation of acetylated H3 histone in PBMC was observed after administration of vorinostat, particularly at higher doses. One patient with neuroblastoma experienced a complete response to the combination. In children with recurrent solid tumors, vorinostat is well-tolerated at 230 mg/m(2)/d, with a modest dose reduction being required when combining vorinostat with 13cRA.

Phase II randomized comparison of topotecan plus cyclophosphamide versus topotecan alone in children with recurrent or refractory neuroblastoma: a Children's Oncology Group study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2010-07-26,"Single-agent topotecan (TOPO) and combination topotecan and cyclophosphamide (TOPO/CTX) were compared in a phase II randomized trial in relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma. Because responders often underwent further therapies, novel statistical methods were required to compare the long-term outcome of the two treatments. Children with refractory/recurrent neuroblastoma (only one prior aggressive chemotherapy regimen) were randomly assigned to daily 5-day topotecan (2 mg/m(2)) or combination topotecan (0.75 mg/m(2)) and cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m(2)). A randomized two-stage group sequential design enrolled 119 eligible patients. Toxicity and response were estimated. Long-term outcome of protocol therapy was assessed using novel methods-causal inference-which allowed adjustment for the confounding effect of off-study therapies. Seven more responses were observed for TOPO/CTX (complete response [CR] plus partial response [PR], 18 [32%] of 57) than TOPO (CR+PR, 11 [19%] of 59;P = .081); toxicity was similar. At 3 years, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 4% +/- 2% and 15% +/- 4%, respectively. PFS was significantly better for TOPO/CTX (P = .029); there was no difference in OS. Older age at diagnosis and lack of MYCN amplification predicted increased OS (P < .05). Adjusting for randomized treatment effect and subsequent autologous stem-cell transplantation, there was no difference between TOPO and TOPO/CTX in terms of the proportion alive at 2 years. TOPO/CTX was superior to TOPO in terms of PFS, but there was no OS difference. After adjustment for subsequent therapies, no difference was detected in the proportion alive at 2 years.

On 4 days of each 5-day antibody cycle, 70% ethanol was administered instead of heparin to dwell in each patient's mediport overnight. We used clinical monitoring/questionnaires to assess symptoms and measured blood ethanol levels and liver functions. Patients were tracked for positive blood cultures. Time to infection for ethanol-lock-treated patients was compared with historical controls. We administered 123 ethanol-locks. No adverse symptoms attributable to ethanol occurred; one patient's urticaria worsened. Blood ethanol levels averaged 11 mg/dL. The study was voluntarily suspended after 3 patients' catheters became occluded, 1 of which fractured. A positive blood culture occurred in 1 (8%) of 12 patients, but suspension of the study precluded statistical power to detect impact on time to infection. Although children with mediport catheters exhibited nontoxic blood ethanol levels and a low rate of bloodstream infections following prophylactic ethanol-lock use, there was a high incidence of catheter occlusion. Adjustments are necessary before adopting ethanol-locks for routine prophylaxis against catheter infections in children.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",3399.0,38.0,Catheter-related bloodstream infections remain costly with no simple prevention We report preliminary results of a phase I trial of ethanol-lock administration to prevent mediport catheter-related bloodstream infections in children Twelve patients receiving intravenous antibody treatments for were enrolled On 4 days of each 5-day antibody cycle 70 ethanol was administered instead of heparin to dwell in each patient 's mediport overnight We used clinical monitoring/questionnaires to assess symptoms and measured blood ethanol levels and functions Patients were tracked for positive blood cultures Time to infection for ethanol-lock-treated patients was compared with historical controls We administered 123 ethanol-locks No adverse symptoms attributable to ethanol occurred one patient 's urticaria worsened Blood ethanol levels averaged 11 mg/dL The study was voluntarily suspended after 3 patients catheters became occluded 1 of which fractured A positive blood culture occurred in 1 8 of 12 patients but suspension of the study precluded statistical power to detect impact on time to infection Although children with mediport catheters exhibited nontoxic blood ethanol levels and a low rate of bloodstream infections following prophylactic ethanol-lock use there was a high incidence of catheter occlusion Adjustments are necessary before adopting ethanol-locks for routine prophylaxis against catheter infections in children,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3925, 139, 10210, 1875, 918, 6288, 5, 77, 2763, 1070, 21, 414, 1676, 99, 1, 8, 124, 70, 160, 1, 9103, 11517, 634, 6, 1682, 30520, 3925, 139, 10210, 1875, 4, 541, 2544, 7, 357, 1262, 548, 640, 9, 11, 346, 23, 39, 162, 1, 296, 33, 218, 548, 417, 431, 9103, 10, 468, 3496, 1, 7309, 6, 21053, 4, 296, 69, 292, 30520, 18409, 21, 95, 38, 1315, 2956, 6, 423, 507, 2, 644, 315, 9103, 148, 2, 1681, 7, 11, 9331, 9, 109, 315, 3231, 98, 6, 930, 9, 9103, 11517, 73, 7, 10, 72, 5, 2252, 535, 21, 468, 2698, 9103, 34990, 77, 290, 507, 2971, 6, 9103, 489, 104, 69, 292, 18802, 5890, 315, 9103, 148, 6893, 175, 81, 1826, 3, 45, 10, 31330, 14903, 50, 27, 7, 6722, 3451, 31685, 14, 1, 92, 34991, 8, 109, 315, 2099, 489, 4, 14, 66, 1, 133, 7, 84, 9348, 1, 3, 45, 8035, 1050, 2349, 6, 1426, 345, 23, 98, 6, 930, 242, 541, 5, 30520, 6722, 1416, 10535, 315, 9103, 148, 2, 8, 154, 116, 1, 10210, 1875, 366, 1862, 9103, 11517, 119, 125, 10, 8, 64, 287, 1, 3925, 9742, 6017, 32, 1493, 348, 10096, 9103, 34990, 9, 1311, 2049, 480, 3925, 1875, 4, 541]",1432.0,20920713,165

Hu14.18-IL2 was given intravenously (12 mg/m(2)/daily) for 3 days every 4 weeks for patients with disease measurable by standard radiographic criteria (stratum 1) and for patients with disease evaluable only by [(123)I]metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy and/or bone marrow (BM) histology (stratum 2). Response was established by independent radiology review as well as BM histology and immunocytology, and durability was assessed by repeat evaluation after more than 3 weeks. Thirty-nine patients were enrolled (36 evaluable). No responses were seen in stratum 1 (n = 13). Of 23 evaluable patients in stratum 2, five patients (21.7%) responded; all had a complete response (CR) of 9, 13, 20, 30, and 35+ months duration.

"Curcumin, the golden spice from Indian saffron, is a chemosensitizer and radiosensitizer for tumors and chemoprotector and radioprotector for normal organs.",Nutrition and cancer,Nutr Cancer,2010-01-01,"Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), the yellow pigment in Indian saffron (Curcuma longa; also called turmeric, haldi, or haridara in the East and curry powder in the West), has been consumed by people for centuries as a dietary component and for a variety of proinflammatory ailments. Extensive research within the last decade in cell culture and in rodents has revealed that curcumin can sensitize tumors to different chemotherapeutic agents including doxorubicin, 5-FU, paclitaxel, vincristine, melphalan, butyrate, cisplatin, celecoxib, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, etoposide, sulfinosine, thalidomide, and bortezomib. Chemosensitization has been observed in cancers of the breast, colon, pancreas, gastric, liver, blood, lung, prostate, bladder, cervix, ovary, head and neck, and brain and in multiple myeloma, leukemia, and lymphoma. Similar studies have also revealed that this agent can sensitize a variety of tumors to gamma radiation including glioma, neuroblastoma, cervical carcinoma, epidermal carcinoma, prostate cancer, and colon cancer. How curcumin acts as a chemosensitizer and radiosensitizer has also been studied extensively. For example, it downregulates various growth regulatory pathways and specific genetic targets including genes for NF-κB, STAT3, COX2, Akt, antiapoptotic proteins, growth factor receptors, and multidrug-resistance proteins. Although it acts as a chemosensitizer and radiosensitizer for tumors in some cases, curcumin has also been shown to protect normal organs such as liver, kidney, oral mucosa, and heart from chemotherapy and radiotherapy-induced toxicity. The protective effects of curcumin appear to be mediated through its ability to induce the activation of NRF2 and induce the expression of antioxidant enzymes (e.g., hemeoxygenase-1, glutathione peroxidase, modulatory subunit of gamma-glutamyl-cysteine ligase, and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1, increase glutathione (a product of the modulatory subunit of gamma-glutamyl-cysteine ligase), directly quench free radicals, and inhibit p300 HAT activity.

High-dose cyclophosphamide-irinotecan-vincristine for primary refractory neuroblastoma.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",Eur. J. Cancer,2010-10-08,"We used a novel regimen for neuroblastoma (NB) that had responded inadequately to standard chemotherapy which now includes topotecan in induction or second-line therapy. We retrospectively studied 38 patients who received one or two courses of high-dose cyclophosphamide (140 mg/kg)-irinotecan (CPT-11) (250 mg/m(2))-vincristine (HD-CCV) as treatment for NB that had responded incompletely to induction but had never progressed. Treatment was outpatient and was preceded and followed by extent-of-disease and toxicity evaluations because the patients were being considered for enrolment on formal protocols. Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated from day 1 of HD-CCV. Common toxicities were grade 4 myelosuppression and grade 2 diarrhoea. Responses--5 complete (CR), 3 partial (PR), 4 mixed (MR)--occurred in 12/28 (43%) patients treated ≤9 months, and in 1/10 (10%) patients treated >10 months, from diagnosis. HD-CCV was the initial salvage regimen after topotecan-containing induction in 5 patients, achieving 1 CR, 1 MR and 3 stable disease (NR). HD-CCV produced responses (2 PR, 3 MR) in all 5 patients previously treated with CPT-11/ temozolomide. In contrast, all 6 patients treated post-HD-CCV with CPT-11/temozolomide had NR to the latter. Post-HD-CCV treatments included immunotherapy, targeted radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.

Furthermore, killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)/KIR-ligand mismatch is associated with improved outcome to autologous stem cell transplant for NBL. Additionally, clinical antitumor response to monoclonal antibodies has been associated with specific polymorphic-FcγR alleles. Relapsed/refractory NBL patients received the hu14.18-IL2 IC (humanized anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody linked to human IL2) in a Children's Oncology Group phase II trial. In this report, these patients were genotyped for KIR, HLA, and FcR alleles to determine whether KIR receptor-ligand mismatch or specific FcγR alleles were associated with antitumor response. DNA samples were available for 38 of 39 patients enrolled: 24 were found to have autologous KIR/KIR-ligand mismatch; 14 were matched. Of the 24 mismatched patients, 7 experienced either complete response or improvement of their disease after IC therapy. There was no response or comparable improvement of disease in patients who were matched. Thus KIR/KIR-ligand mismatch was associated with response/improvement to IC (P = 0.03). There was a trend toward patients with the FcγR2A 131-H/H genotype showing a higher response rate than other FcγR2A genotypes (P = 0.06).

Expression of the neuron-specific protein CHD5 is an independent marker of outcome in neuroblastoma.,Molecular cancer,Mol. Cancer,2010-10-15,"The chromodomain, helicase DNA-binding protein 5 (CHD5) is a potential tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 1p36, a region recurrently deleted in high risk neuroblastoma (NB). Previous data have shown that CHD5 mRNA is present in normal neural tissues and in low risk NB, nevertheless, the distribution of CHD5 protein has not been explored. The aim of this study was to investigate CHD5 protein expression as an immunohistochemical marker of outcome in NB. With this purpose, CHD5 protein expression was analyzed in normal neural tissues and neuroblastic tumors (NTs). CHD5 gene and protein expression was reexamined after induction chemotherapy in a subset of high risk tumors to identify potential changes reflecting tumor response. We provide evidence that CHD5 is a neuron-specific protein, absent in glial cells, with diverse expression amongst neuron types. Within NTs, CHD5 immunoreactivity was found restricted to differentiating neuroblasts and ganglion-like cells, and absent in undifferentiated neuroblasts and stromal Schwann cells. Correlation between protein and mRNA levels was found, suggesting transcriptional regulation of CHD5. An immunohistochemical analysis of 90 primary NTs highlighted a strong association of CHD5 expression with favorable prognostic variables (age at diagnosis <12 months, low clinical stage, and favorable histology; P < 0.001 for all), overall survival (OS) (P < 0.001) and event-free survival (EFS) (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that CHD5 prognostic value is independent of other clinical and biologically relevant parameters, and could therefore represent a marker of outcome in NB that can be tested by conventional immunohistochemistry. The prognostic value of CHD5 was confirmed in an independent, blinded set of 32 NB tumors (P < 0.001).Reactivation of CHD5 expression after induction chemotherapy was observed mainly in those high risk tumors with induced tumor cell differentiation features. Remarkably, these NB tumors showed good clinical response and prolonged patient survival. The neuron-specific protein CHD5 may represent a marker of outcome in NB that can be tested by conventional immunohistochemistry.

When present in cis with an ALK translocation, this mutation (also detected in neuroblastomas) causes an increase in ALK phosphorylation, cell growth, and downstream signaling. Furthermore, the F1174L mutation inhibits crizotinib-mediated downregulation of ALK signaling and blocks apoptosis in RANBP2-ALK Ba/F3 cells.

Daily image-guided localization for neuroblastoma.,Journal of applied clinical medical physics,J Appl Clin Med Phys,2010-10-11,"The purpose was to quantify the setup margin for pediatric patients with neuro-blastoma using cone beam CT imaging (CBCT) and ultrasound localization. Ten patients, with a median age of 4.3 years (1.8 to 7.9) underwent daily pretreatment localization CBCT and every other day post-treatment CBCT to calculate interfractional and intrafraction movement. Localization was based on CBCT to treatment planning CT registration in the lumbar spine region. Each subject was treated in the supine position under IV general anesthesia using intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Patients were repositioned based on the daily pretreatment CBCT. Required setup margins based on inter- and intrafraction positioning errors were calculated based on weekly and daily imaging scenarios. Four patients had ultra-sound localization of the kidneys performed before the CBCT. Correlation between daily CBCT and ultrasound was investigated. A lateral, longitudinal and vertical setup margin of 5.4, 5.6, and 5.9 mm is required without daily CBCT. When daily CBCT was incorporated, the setup margin was reduced to 1.5, 2.1, and 1.7 mm. There was no correlation between the suggested ultrasound shifts and the shifts based on the CBCT. Daily localization based on CBCT of the lumbar spine can reduce the required setup margin for neuroblastoma patients, thereby reducing normal tissue exposure for this young patient population. The internal margin needs further investigation before PTV reduction can be made.

Clin. Oncol.,2010-11-29,"This phase II study was conducted to determine the response rate associated with use of irinotecan and temozolomide for children with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma. Patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma measurable by cross-sectional imaging (stratum 1) or assessable by bone marrow aspirate/biopsy or metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan (stratum 2) received irinotecan (10 mg/m(2)/dose 5 days a week for 2 weeks) and temozolomide (100 mg/m(2)/dose for 5 days) every 3 weeks. Response was assessed after three and six courses using International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria. Of the first 25 evaluable patients on a given stratum, five or more patients with complete or partial responses were required to conclude that further study would be merited. Fifty-five eligible patients were enrolled. The objective response rate was 15%. Fourteen patients (50%) on stratum 1 and 15 patients (56%) on stratum 2 had stable disease. Objective responses were observed in three of the first 25 evaluable patients on stratum 1 and five of the first 25 evaluable patients on stratum 2. Less than 6% of patients experienced ≥ grade 3 diarrhea. Although neutropenia was observed, less than 10% of patients developed evidence of infection while neutropenic. The combination of irinotecan and temozolomide was well tolerated. The objective response rate of 19% in stratum 2 suggests that this combination may be effective for patients with neuroblastoma detectable by MIBG or marrow analysis. Although fewer objective responses were observed in patients with disease measurable by computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, patients in both strata seem to have derived clinical benefit from this therapy.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",3340.0,81.0,This phase II study was conducted to determine the response rate associated with use of irinotecan and temozolomide for children with relapsed/refractory Patients with relapsed/refractory measurable by cross-sectional imaging stratum 1 or assessable by marrow aspirate/biopsy or metaiodobenzylguanidine MIBG scan stratum 2 received irinotecan 10 mg/m 2 /dose 5 days a week for 2 weeks and temozolomide 100 mg/m 2 /dose for 5 days every 3 weeks Response was assessed after three and six courses using International Response Criteria Of the first 25 evaluable patients on a given stratum five or more patients with complete or partial responses were required to conclude that further study would be merited Fifty-five eligible patients were enrolled The objective response rate was 15 Fourteen patients 50 on stratum 1 and 15 patients 56 on stratum 2 had stable disease Objective responses were observed in three of the first 25 evaluable patients on stratum 1 and five of the first 25 evaluable patients on stratum 2 Less than 6 of patients experienced ≥ grade 3 diarrhea Although neutropenia was observed less than 10 of patients developed evidence of infection while neutropenic The combination of irinotecan and temozolomide was well tolerated The objective response rate of 19 in stratum 2 suggests that this combination may be effective for patients with detectable by MIBG or marrow analysis Although fewer objective responses were observed in patients with disease measurable by computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging patients in both strata seem to have derived clinical benefit from this therapy,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[26, 124, 215, 45, 10, 426, 6, 223, 3, 51, 116, 41, 5, 119, 1, 1071, 2, 1537, 9, 541, 5, 591, 430, 7, 5, 591, 430, 1884, 20, 1383, 2832, 270, 4897, 14, 15, 3120, 20, 581, 8022, 411, 15, 11285, 3574, 1657, 4897, 18, 103, 1071, 79, 81, 188, 18, 61, 33, 162, 8, 647, 9, 18, 244, 2, 1537, 394, 81, 188, 18, 61, 9, 33, 162, 454, 27, 244, 51, 10, 275, 50, 169, 2, 437, 1993, 75, 944, 51, 371, 1, 3, 157, 243, 859, 7, 23, 8, 447, 4897, 365, 15, 80, 7, 5, 236, 15, 450, 253, 11, 616, 6, 2060, 17, 195, 45, 688, 40, 20428, 1461, 365, 625, 7, 11, 346, 3, 461, 51, 116, 10, 167, 3225, 7, 212, 23, 4897, 14, 2, 167, 7, 664, 23, 4897, 18, 42, 585, 34, 461, 253, 11, 164, 4, 169, 1, 3, 157, 243, 859, 7, 23, 4897, 14, 2, 365, 1, 3, 157, 243, 859, 7, 23, 4897, 18, 299, 76, 49, 1, 7, 592, 749, 88, 27, 1172, 242, 778, 10, 164, 299, 76, 79, 1, 7, 276, 241, 1, 930, 369, 3659, 3, 150, 1, 1071, 2, 1537, 10, 149, 421, 3, 461, 51, 116, 1, 326, 4, 4897, 18, 844, 17, 26, 150, 68, 40, 323, 9, 7, 5, 2083, 20, 3574, 15, 581, 65, 242, 1497, 461, 253, 11, 164, 4, 7, 5, 34, 1884, 20, 1220, 872, 1484, 1535, 270, 7, 4, 110, 5758, 3233, 6, 47, 526, 38, 247, 29, 26, 36]",1611.0,21115869,237
Risk of second primary thyroid cancer after radiotherapy for a childhood cancer in a large cohort study: an update from the childhood cancer survivor study.,Radiation research,Radiat. Res.,2010-10-06,"Previous studies have indicated that thyroid cancer risk after a first childhood malignancy is curvilinear with radiation dose, increasing at low to moderate doses and decreasing at high doses. Understanding factors that modify the radiation dose response over the entire therapeutic dose range is challenging and requires large numbers of subjects. We quantified the long-term risk of thyroid cancer associated with radiation treatment among 12,547 5-year survivors of a childhood cancer (leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, central nervous system cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, kidney cancer, bone cancer, neuroblastoma) diagnosed between 1970 and 1986 in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study using the most current cohort follow-up to 2005. There were 119 subsequent pathologically confirmed thyroid cancer cases, and individual radiation doses to the thyroid gland were estimated for the entire cohort. This cohort study builds on the previous case-control study in this population (69 thyroid cancer cases with follow-up to 2000) by allowing the evaluation of both relative and absolute risks. Poisson regression analyses were used to calculate standardized incidence ratios (SIR), excess relative risks (ERR) and excess absolute risks (EAR) of thyroid cancer associated with radiation dose. Other factors such as sex, type of first cancer, attained age, age at exposure to radiation, time since exposure to radiation, and chemotherapy (yes/no) were assessed for their effect on the linear and exponential quadratic terms describing the dose-response relationship. Similar to the previous analysis, thyroid cancer risk increased linearly with radiation dose up to approximately 20 Gy, where the relative risk peaked at 14.6-fold (95% CI, 6.8-31.5). At thyroid radiation doses >20 Gy, a downturn in the dose-response relationship was observed. The ERR model that best fit the data was linear-exponential quadratic.

Checkpoint kinase inhibitor synergizes with DNA-damaging agents in G1 checkpoint-defective neuroblastoma.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2011-03-08,"Checkpoint kinase inhibitors can enhance the cancer killing action of DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents by disrupting the S/G(2)  cell cycle checkpoints. The in vitro and in vivo effects of the Chk1/2 inhibitor AZD7762 when combined with these agents were examined using neuroblastoma cell lines with known p53/MDM2/p14(ARF)  genomic status. Four of four p53 mutant lines and three of five MDM2/p14(ARF)  abnormal lines were defective in G(1)  checkpoint, correlating with failure to induce endogenous p21 after treatment with DNA-damaging agents. In cytotoxicity assays, these G(1)  checkpoint-defective lines were more resistant to DNA-damaging agents when compared to G(1)  checkpoint intact lines, yet becoming more sensitive when AZD7762 was added. Moreover, AZD7762 abrogated DNA damage-induced S/G(2)  checkpoint arrest both in vitro and in vivo. In xenograft models, a significant delay in tumor growth accompanied by histological evidence of increased apoptosis was observed, when AZD7762 was added to the DNA-damaging drug gemcitabine.

Lestaurtinib dose was escalated using a 3 + 3 design. Pharmacokinetics and plasma phospho-TrkB inhibitory activity were evaluated in the first cycle. Forty-seven subjects were enrolled, and 10 dose levels explored starting at 25 mg/M(2)/dose BID. Forty-six subjects were evaluable for response, and 42 subjects were fully evaluable for determination of dose escalation. Asymptomatic and reversible grade 3-4 transaminase elevation was dose limiting in 4 subjects. Reversible pancreatitis (grade 2) was observed in 3 subjects after prolonged treatment at higher dose levels. Other toxicities were mild and reversible.

Successful multifold dose escalation of anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody 3F8 in patients with neuroblastoma: a phase I study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2011-02-22,"Pain can hinder immunotherapy with anti-G(D2) monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) like 3F8. Heat-modified 3F8 (HM3F8) lacks effector functions and could mask G(D2) or cross-reactive epitopes on nerves, thereby preventing a subsequent dose of unmodified 3F8 from activating pain fibers. We hypothesized that 3F8 dose escalation is possible without increased analgesic requirements in patients pretreated with HM3F8. Thirty patients with resistant neuroblastoma (NB) received one to two cycles of 3F8 plus granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. 3F8 dosing began at 20 mg/m(2)/d and increased by 20 mg/m(2)/d in the absence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Premedication included analgesics, antihistamines, and 5-minute infusions of HM3F8. On the basis of experience with 3F8 10 mg/m(2)/d in prior protocols, the DLT of pain was defined as more than seven doses of opioids administered within 2 hours. Opioid use was compared with a contemporary control group treated with 3F8 20 mg/m(2)/d but no HM3F8. Disease response was assessed. Treatment was administered in the outpatient setting. Dose escalation stopped at 160 mg/m(2)/d because of drug supply limitations; even through this dosage level, analgesic requirements were similar to historical controls, and there were no DLTs. Analgesic requirements at 3F8 dosage levels through 80 mg/m(2)/d were significantly less compared with controls. Anti-NB activity occurred at all dosages. Multifold dose escalation of 3F8 is feasible. The findings can be interpreted as compatible with the possibility that HM3F8 can modify toxicity without blunting anti-NB activity. This pain control strategy may help achieve dose escalation with other anti-G(D2) MoAbs.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",3255.0,40.0,Pain can hinder immunotherapy with anti-G D2 monoclonal antibodies MoAbs like 3F8 Heat-modified 3F8 HM3F8 lacks effector functions and could mask G D2 or cross-reactive epitopes on nerves thereby preventing a subsequent dose of unmodified 3F8 from activating pain fibers We hypothesized that 3F8 dose escalation is possible without increased analgesic requirements in patients pretreated with HM3F8 Thirty patients with resistant NB received one to two cycles of 3F8 plus granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 3F8 dosing began at 20 mg/m 2 /d and increased by 20 mg/m 2 /d in the absence of dose-limiting toxicity DLT Premedication included analgesics antihistamines and 5-minute infusions of HM3F8 On the basis of experience with 3F8 10 mg/m 2 /d in prior protocols the DLT of pain was defined as more than seven doses of opioids administered within 2 hours Opioid use was compared with a contemporary control group treated with 3F8 20 mg/m 2 /d but no HM3F8 Disease response was assessed Treatment was administered in the outpatient setting Dose escalation stopped at 160 mg/m 2 /d because of drug supply limitations even through this dosage level analgesic requirements were similar to historical controls and there were no DLTs Analgesic requirements at 3F8 dosage levels through 80 mg/m 2 /d were significantly less compared with controls Anti-NB activity occurred at all dosages Multifold dose escalation of 3F8 is feasible The findings can be interpreted as compatible with the possibility that HM3F8 can modify toxicity without blunting anti-NB activity This pain control strategy may help achieve dose escalation with other anti-G D2 MoAbs,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[559, 122, 13006, 726, 5, 312, 499, 4171, 848, 890, 19109, 733, 5970, 3545, 1230, 5970, 31757, 6856, 2070, 1681, 2, 359, 10878, 499, 4171, 15, 1383, 2163, 4915, 23, 6721, 2267, 3017, 8, 706, 61, 1, 10424, 5970, 29, 1616, 559, 12155, 21, 1237, 17, 5970, 61, 1125, 16, 899, 187, 101, 5954, 4230, 4, 7, 2193, 5, 31757, 977, 7, 5, 436, 3446, 103, 104, 6, 100, 410, 1, 5970, 349, 2764, 2674, 1975, 2122, 161, 5970, 1280, 4603, 28, 179, 81, 188, 18, 427, 2, 101, 20, 179, 81, 188, 18, 427, 4, 3, 1127, 1, 61, 817, 155, 2059, 8656, 159, 10091, 27966, 2, 33, 3949, 3435, 1, 31757, 23, 3, 877, 1, 730, 5, 5970, 79, 81, 188, 18, 427, 4, 324, 2189, 3, 2059, 1, 559, 10, 395, 22, 80, 76, 648, 415, 1, 4353, 468, 262, 18, 1459, 2742, 119, 10, 72, 5, 8, 2667, 182, 87, 73, 5, 5970, 179, 81, 188, 18, 427, 84, 77, 31757, 34, 51, 10, 275, 24, 10, 468, 4, 3, 2379, 546, 61, 1125, 4403, 28, 3457, 81, 188, 18, 427, 408, 1, 234, 6296, 1939, 871, 298, 26, 3323, 301, 5954, 4230, 11, 288, 6, 2252, 535, 2, 125, 11, 77, 2506, 5954, 4230, 28, 5970, 3323, 148, 298, 493, 81, 188, 18, 427, 11, 97, 299, 72, 5, 535, 312, 3446, 128, 489, 28, 62, 7352, 30242, 61, 1125, 1, 5970, 16, 1313, 3, 272, 122, 40, 5047, 22, 7293, 5, 3, 2526, 17, 31757, 122, 4289, 155, 187, 22017, 312, 3446, 128, 26, 559, 182, 692, 68, 987, 1359, 61, 1125, 5, 127, 312, 499, 4171, 19109]",1659.0,21343563,60
"Response, survival, and toxicity after iodine-131-metaiodobenzylguanidine therapy for neuroblastoma in preadolescents, adolescents, and adults.",Cancer,Cancer,2011-03-08,"Adolescent and adult patients with neuroblastoma appear to have a more indolent disease course but a lower survival rate compared with their younger counterparts. The majority of neuroblastoma tumors specifically accumulate the radiolabeled norepinephrine analogue iodine-131-metaiodobenzylguanidine ((131) I-MIBG). Therefore, (131) I-MIBG has become increasingly used as targeted radiotherapy for patients with recurrent or refractory neuroblastoma. The objective of the current study was to characterize the toxicity and activity of this therapy in older patients. The authors performed a retrospective analysis of 39 consecutive patients aged ≥10 years with recurrent or refractory neuroblastoma who were treated with (131) I-MIBG monotherapy at the University of California at San Francisco under phase 1, phase 2, and compassionate access protocols. Sixteen patients were aged ≥18 years at the time of MIBG treatment initiation, whereas 23 patients were ages 10 to 17 years. The median cumulative administered dose of (131) I-MIBG was 17.8 millicuries (mCi)/kg. The majority of treatments led to grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicities (graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 3]) that were similar in frequency among age strata. Three patients subsequently developed a hematologic malignancy or myelodysplasia. The overall rate of complete plus partial response was 46%. Patients aged ≥18 years at the time of first MIBG treatment had a significantly higher response rate compared with patients ages 10 to 17 years (56% vs 39%; P = .023). The median overall survival was 23 months with a trend toward longer overall survival for the subgroup of patients aged ≥18 years (P = .12).

Vorinostat increases expression of functional norepinephrine transporter in neuroblastoma in vitro and in vivo model systems.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2011-03-18,"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition causes transcriptional activation or repression of several genes that in turn can influence the biodistribution of other chemotherapeutic agents. Here, we hypothesize that the combination of vorinostat, a HDAC inhibitor, with (131)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) would lead to preferential accumulation of the latter in neuroblastoma (NB) tumors via increased expression of the human norepinephrine transporter (NET). In vitro and in vivo experiments examined the effect of vorinostat on the expression of NET, an uptake transporter for (131)I-MIBG. Human NB cell lines (Kelly and SH-SY-5Y) and NB1691-luc mouse xenografts were employed. The upregulated NET protein was characterized for its effect on (123)I-MIBG biodistribution. Preincubation of NB cell lines, Kelly, and SH-SY-5Y, with vorinostat caused dose-dependent increases in NET mRNA and protein levels. Accompanying this was a corresponding dose-dependent increase in MIBG uptake in NB cell lines. Four- and 2.5-fold increases were observed in Kelly and SH-SY-5Y cells, respectively, pretreated with vorinostat in comparison to untreated cells. Similarly, NB xenografts, created by intravenous tail vein injection of NB1691-luc, and harvested from nude mice livers treated with vorinostat (150 mg/kg i.p.) showed substantial increases in NET protein expression. Maximal effect of vorinostat pretreatment in NB xenografts on (123)I-MIBG biodistribution was observed in tumors that exhibited enhanced uptake in vorinostat-treated [0.062 ± 0.011 μCi/(mg tissue-dose injected)] vs. -untreated mice [0.022 ± 0.003 μCi/(mg tissue-dose injected); P < 0.05].

Cooperation of the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat and radiation in metastatic neuroblastoma: efficacy and underlying mechanisms.,Cancer letters,Cancer Lett.,2011-04-16,"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors can radiosensitize cancer cells. Radiation is critical in high-risk neuroblastoma treatment, and combinations of HDAC inhibitor vorinostat and radiation are proposed for neuroblastoma trials. Therefore, we investigated radiosensitizing effects of vorinostat in neuroblastoma. Treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines decreased cell viability and resulted in additive effects with radiation.

Dose escalation of intravenous irinotecan using oral cefpodoxime: a phase I study in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2011-04-20,"Administration of an oral cephalosporin allowed advancement of the dosage of oral irinotecan. This study investigates whether administration of an oral cephalosporin increases the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intravenous irinotecan. Irinotecan was administered intravenously on Days 1-5 and Days 8-12 of a 21-day cycle with continuous oral cefpodoxime starting 2 days prior to irinotecan. Cohorts of 3-6 pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors were enrolled at 4 dosage levels, starting at the single-agent irinotecan MTD of 20 mg/m(2) /dose.

Cohorts of three to six patients 1 to 21 years of age with recurrent or refractory solid tumors were treated with a 1-hour intravenous infusion of temsirolimus weekly for 3 weeks per course at one of four dose levels: 10, 25, 75, or 150 mg/m(2). During the first two courses, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluations (phosphorylation of S6, AKT, and 4EBP1 in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells) were performed. Dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 anorexia) occurred in one of 18 evaluable patients at the 150 mg/m(2) level, which was determined to be tolerable, and an MTD was not identified. In 13 patients evaluable for response after two courses of therapy, one had complete response (CR; neuroblastoma) and five had stable disease (SD). Four patients (three SDs + one CR) remained on treatment for more than 4 months. The sum of temsirolimus and sirolimus areas under the concentration-time curve was comparable to values in adults. AKT and 4EBP1 phosphorylation were inhibited at all dose levels, particularly after two courses. Weekly intravenous temsirolimus is well tolerated in children with recurrent solid tumors, demonstrates antitumor activity, has pharmacokinetics similar to those in adults, and inhibits the mTOR signaling pathway in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells.

Notch pathway activation induces neuroblastoma tumor cell growth arrest.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2011-07-08,"Notch pathway signaling has critical roles in differentiation, proliferation, and survival, and has oncogenic or tumor suppressor effects in a variety of malignancies. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of Notch activation on human neuroblastoma cells. Quantitative RT-PCR, immunoblots, and immunohistochemistry were used to determine the expression of Notch receptors (Notch1-4), cleaved Notch1 (ICN1), and downstream targets (HES1-5) in human neuroblastoma cell lines and patient tumor samples. Notch pathway signaling was induced using intracellular Notch (ICN1-3) and HES gene constructs or direct culture on Notch ligands. Quantitative methylation-specific PCR was used to quantify methylation of the HES gene promoters, and the effects of treatment with decitabine were measured. Neuroblastoma cells express varying levels of Notch receptors and low levels of HES genes at baseline. However, no endogenous activation of the Notch pathway was detected in neuroblastoma cell lines or patient tumor samples. Expression of activated Notch intracellular domains and HES gene products led to growth arrest. The HES2 and HES5 gene promoters were found to be heavily methylated in most neuroblastoma lines, and HES gene expression could be induced through treatment with decitabine. We report that neuroblastoma cell lines express multiple Notch receptors, which are inactive at baseline. Activation of the Notch pathway via ligand binding consistently resulted in growth arrest.

A single-arm pilot phase II study of gefitinib and irinotecan in children with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma.,Investigational new drugs,Invest New Drugs,2011-07-28,"Gefitinib potently inhibits neuroblastoma proliferation in vitro, and the gefitinib/irinotecan combination shows greater than additive activity against neuroblastoma xenografts. This Phase II pilot study estimated the rate of response to two courses of intravenous irinotecan plus oral gefitinib in children with untreated high-risk neuroblastoma. Two courses of irinotecan [15 mg/m(2)/day (daily ×5)×2] were combined with 12 daily doses of gefitinib (112.5 mg/m(2)/day). Response was assessed after 6 weeks. A response rate >55% was sought. Of the 23 children enrolled, 19 were evaluable for response. Median age at diagnosis was 3.1 years (range, 18 days-12.7 years). Most patients were older than 24 months (n = 20; 87%), male (n = 18; 78%), white (n = 16; 70%), had INSS 4 disease (n = 19; 83%), and had adrenal primary tumors (n = 18; 78%); nine patients (39%) had amplified tumor MYCN. The toxicity of gefitinib/irinotecan was mild and reversible (nausea, 5/20; diarrhea, 8/20; vomiting, 7/20). Five patients had partial responses; 9 others had a 23%-60% decrease in primary tumor volume and/or improved MIBG scans or decreased bone or bone marrow tumor burden. Median (range) systemic irinotecan exposure (AUC) was 283 ng/ml*hr (range, 163-890 ng/ml*hr) and 28 ng/ml*hr (3.6-297 ng/ml*hr) for the active metabolite, SN-38.

MYCN and MYC regulate tumor proliferation and tumorigenesis directly through BMI1 in human neuroblastomas.,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,FASEB J.,2011-08-19,"The BMI1 gene is overexpressed in ≈ 90% of human neuroblastomas. However, little is known about the regulation of BMI1 expression. Using microarray and immunohistochemical analysis, we show that BMI1 expression correlated with MYCN levels in MYCN-amplified human neuroblastomas, and with MYC levels in the MYCN-nonamplified group. We further demonstrated that BMI1 is a direct target gene of MYCN/MYC in 3 neuroblastoma cell lines: BE (2)-C, LAN1, and SH-SY5Y. Overexpression of MYCN or MYC transactivated the BMI1 promoter and up-regulated BMI1 gene expression. shRNA-mediated knockdown of MYCN or MYC decreased BMI1 gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and point-mutation assays revealed that both MYCN and MYC bind to the E-box within the BMI1 promoter. Overexpression of BMI1, MYCN, and MYC independently increased both cell proliferation and tumor growth. Conversely, specific inhibition of BMI1, MYCN, and MYC decreased tumor cell proliferation and tumor growth. Interestingly, BMI1 suppression in MYCN/MYC-overexpressing cells resulted in significantly greater inhibition compared to that in mock-transduced and parental cells.

Combining curcumin (diferuloylmethane) and heat shock protein inhibition for neurofibromatosis 2 treatment: analysis of response and resistance pathways.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2011-09-08,"Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a genetic condition characterized by inactivation of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene and the development of schwannomas. The NF2 gene product, merlin, is activated (dephosphorylated) by contact inhibition and promotes growth suppression. We investigated the effect of curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a molecule with anti-inflammatory and antitumorigenic properties, on human schwannoma cell growth and the regulation of merlin by curcumin in both NF2 cells and neuroblastoma (non-NF2) cells. Curcumin inhibited the growth of HEI-193 schwannoma cells in vitro and downregulated the phosphorylation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. Curcumin also activated MYPT1-pp1δ (a merlin phosphatase), which was associated with dephosphorylation of merlin on serine 518, an event that results in the folding of merlin to its active conformation. In addition, curcumin induced apoptosis and generated reactive oxygen species in HEI-193 cells. Consequently, hsp70 was upregulated at the mRNA and protein levels, possibly serving as a mechanism of escape from curcumin-induced apoptosis and growth inhibition. Endogenous merlin and hsp70 proteins interacted in HEI-193 schwannoma and SK-N-AS neuroblastoma cells. The combination of curcumin and an hsp inhibitor synergistically suppressed schwannoma cell growth.

Pain in long-term adult survivors of childhood cancers and their siblings: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,Pain,Pain,2011-09-09,"Little is known about pain among long-term adult survivors of childhood cancers. The study investigated pain prevalence in this population compared with sibling controls and examined pain-related risk factors. Three self-reported pain outcomes including pain conditions, prescription analgesics used, and pain attributed to cancer and treatment were assessed among 10,397 cancer survivors and 3034 sibling controls from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. Pain conditions (pain/abnormal sensation, migraines, and other headaches) were reported by 12.3%, 15.5%, and 20.5% of survivors, respectively; 16.7% of survivors reported use of prescription analgesics, and 21% attributed pain to cancer and treatment. Risks of reporting pain conditions and using prescription analgesics were higher among survivors than siblings, adjusting for sociodemographic factors. Younger age at diagnosis and a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Wilms tumor, or neuroblastoma (compared to leukemia) were associated with greater risk of reporting pain conditions. A history of bone cancer or soft tissue sarcoma (compared to leukemia) was associated with greater risks of using prescription analgesics and cancer-related pain attribution.

Prognostic value of the stage 4S metastatic pattern and tumor biology in patients with metastatic neuroblastoma diagnosed between birth and 18 months of age.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2011-10-03,"Patients with neuroblastoma younger than 12 months of age with a 4S pattern of disease (metastases limited to liver, skin, bone marrow) have better outcomes than infants with stage 4 disease. The new International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) staging system extends age to 18 months for the 4S pattern. Our aim was to determine which prognostic features could be used for optimal risk classification among patients younger than 18 months with metastatic disease. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival were analyzed by log-rank tests, Cox models, and survival tree regression for 656 infants with stage 4S neuroblastoma younger than 12 months of age and 1,019 patients with stage 4 disease younger than 18 months of age in the INRG database. Unfavorable biologic features were more frequent in infants with stage 4 disease than in infants with 4S tumors and higher overall in those age 12 to 18 months (although not different for stage 4 v 4S pattern). EFS was significantly better for infants younger than 12 months with 4S pattern than with stage 4 disease (P < .01) but similar for toddlers age 12 to 18 months with stage 4 versus 4S pattern. Among 717 patients with stage 4S pattern, patients age 12 to 18 months had worse EFS than those age younger than 12 months (P < .01). MYCN, 11q, mitosis-karyorrhexis index (MKI), ploidy, and lactate dehydrogenase were independently statistically significant predictors of EFS and more highly predictive than age or metastatic pattern.

Clin. Oncol.,2011-10-17,"To assess the feasibility of adding dose-intensive topotecan and cyclophosphamide to induction therapy for newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma (HRNB). Enrolled patients received two cycles of topotecan (approximately 1.2 mg/m(2)/d) and cyclophosphamide (400 mg/m(2)/d) for 5 days followed by four cycles of multiagent chemotherapy (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center [MSKCC] regimen). Pharmacokinetically guided topotecan dosing (target systemic exposure with area under the curve of 50 to 70 ng/mL/hr) was performed. Peripheral-blood stem cell (PBSC) harvest and surgical resection of residual primary tumor occurred after cycles 2 and 5, respectively. Patients achieving at least a partial response received myeloablative chemotherapy with PBSC rescue and radiation to the presurgical primary tumor volume. Oral 13-cis-retinoic acid maintenance therapy was administered twice daily for 14 days in six 28-day cycles. Thirty-one patients were enrolled onto the study. No deaths related to toxicity or dose-limiting toxicities occurred during induction. Mucositis rarely occurred after topotecan cycles (9.7%) in contrast to 30% after MSKCC cycles. Thirty patients underwent PBSC collection with median 31.1 × 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg (range, 1.8 to 541.8 × 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg), all negative for tumor contamination by immunocytochemical analysis. Targeted topotecan systemic exposure was achieved in 26 (84%) of 31 patients. At the end of induction, 26 patients (84%) had tumor response and one patient had progressive disease. In the overall cohort, 3-year event-free and overall survival were 37.8% ± 9.4% and 57.1% ± 9.4%, respectively.

We examined epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Kirsten rate sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), PIK3CA, v-akt murine thymoma vial oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1), v-ras neuroblastoma viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1), and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) in patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung to identify driver mutations. Clinical data were obtained from the medical records of individuals with mutations in PIK3CA. Twenty-three of 1,125 (2%, 95% CI: 1-3) patients had a mutation in PIK3CA, 12 in exon 9 (10 E545K and 2 E542K), and 11 in exon 20 (3 H1047L and 8 H1047R). The patients (57% women) had a median age of 66 at diagnosis (range: 34-78). Eight patients (35%) were never smokers. Sixteen of 23 (70%, 95% CI: 49-86) had coexisting mutations in other oncogenes-10 KRAS, 1 MEK1, 1 BRAF, 1 ALK rearrangement, and 3 EGFR exon 19 deletions. We conclude that PIK3CA mutations occur in lung adenocarcinomas, usually concurrently with EGFR, KRAS, and ALK. The impact of PIK3CA mutations on the efficacy of targeted therapies such as erlotinib and crizotinib is unknown.

Oncogene mutation profiling of pediatric solid tumors reveals significant subsets of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma with mutated genes in growth signaling pathways.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2011-12-05,"In contrast to the numerous broad screens for oncogene mutations in adult cancers, few such screens have been conducted in pediatric solid tumors. To identify novel mutations and potential therapeutic targets in pediatric cancers, we conducted a high-throughput Sequenom-based analysis in large sets of several major pediatric solid cancers, including neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), and desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT). We designed a highly multiplexed Sequenom-based assay to interrogate 275 recurrent mutations across 29 genes. Genomic DNA was extracted from 192 neuroblastoma, 75 Ewing sarcoma, 89 RMS, and 24 DSRCT samples. All mutations were verified by Sanger sequencing. Mutations were identified in 13% of neuroblastoma samples, 4% of Ewing sarcoma samples, 21.1% of RMS samples, and no DSRCT samples. ALK mutations were present in 10.4% of neuroblastoma samples. The remainder of neuroblastoma mutations involved the BRAF, RAS, and MAP2K1 genes and were absent in samples harboring ALK mutations. Mutations were more common in embryonal RMS (ERMS) samples (28.3%) than alveolar RMS (3.5%). In addition to previously identified RAS and FGFR4 mutations, we report for the first time PIK3CA and CTNNB1 (β-catenin) mutations in 5% and 3.3% of ERMS, respectively. In ERMS, Ewing sarcoma, and neuroblastoma, we identified novel occurrences of several oncogene mutations recognized as drivers in other cancers.

In the majority, induction therapy resulted in a shift from an intermediate/high to low mitosis-karyorrhexis index (MKI) (P = 0.0009) and from undifferentiated/poorly differentiated to differentiating tumors (P < 0.0001).

Oncol.,2011-12-27,"Adjuvant therapy using anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has shown treatment success for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma (NB). Although there is ample evidence on how the antibody targets NB, in vivo contribution by GM-CSF remains unclear. This report investigates granulocyte activation and its correlation with treatment outcome. Patients enrolled onto NCT00072358 received multiple treatment cycles, each consisting of anti-GD2 antibody 3F8 plus subcutaneous (SC) GM-CSF. Peripheral-blood (PB) samples from 151 patients were collected on day 0 and day 4 of cycle 1. PB from a subgroup of 35 patients had intravenous (IV) instead of SC GM-CSF during cycle 4. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry for CD11a, CD63, CD87, and CD11b and its activation epitope CBRM1/5. Comparing cycle 1 day 4 PB samples with day 0 PB samples, five of five activation marker-positive granulocytes were significantly higher. The change in frequency and mean fluorescence intensity of CBRM1/5-positive granulocytes correlated with progression-free survival (PFS; P = .024 and P = .008, respectively). A multivariable analysis identified increasing CBRM1/5-positive granulocytes and missing killer immunoglobulin-like receptor ligand as positive independent prognostic factors for PFS, whereas second-line cyclophosphamide-based therapy before protocol entry negatively influenced outcome. Thirty-five patients who received SC GM-CSF at cycle 1 and IV GM-CSF at cycle 4 had significantly less CBRM1/5 activation after IV GM-CSF. In contrast, 63 patients who received SC GM-CSF at both cycles had comparable CBRM1/5 activation. GM-CSF-induced granulocyte activation in vivo is associated with improved patient outcome. This activation was more apparent when GM-CSF was given by the SC route instead of IV route.",Clinical Trial,2947.0,36.0,Adjuvant therapy using anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor GM-CSF has shown treatment success for patients with high-risk NB Although there is ample evidence on how the antibody targets NB in vivo contribution by GM-CSF remains unclear This report investigates granulocyte activation and its correlation with treatment outcome Patients enrolled onto NCT00072358 received multiple treatment cycles each consisting of anti-GD2 antibody 3F8 plus subcutaneous SC GM-CSF Peripheral-blood PB samples from 151 patients were collected on day 0 and day 4 of cycle 1 PB from a subgroup of 35 patients had intravenous IV instead of SC GM-CSF during cycle 4 Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry for CD11a CD63 CD87 and CD11b and its activation epitope CBRM1/5 Comparing cycle 1 day 4 PB samples with day 0 PB samples five of five activation marker-positive granulocytes were significantly higher The change in frequency and mean fluorescence intensity of CBRM1/5-positive granulocytes correlated with progression-free survival PFS P .024 and P .008 respectively A multivariable analysis identified increasing CBRM1/5-positive granulocytes and missing killer immunoglobulin-like receptor ligand as positive independent prognostic factors for PFS whereas second-line cyclophosphamide-based therapy before protocol entry negatively influenced outcome Thirty-five patients who received SC GM-CSF at cycle 1 and IV GM-CSF at cycle 4 had significantly less CBRM1/5 activation after IV GM-CSF In contrast 63 patients who received SC GM-CSF at both cycles had comparable CBRM1/5 activation GM-CSF-induced granulocyte activation in vivo is associated with improved patient outcome This activation was more apparent when GM-CSF was given by the SC route instead of IV route,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[249, 36, 75, 312, 4758, 848, 548, 2, 2764, 2674, 1975, 2122, 161, 2147, 1211, 71, 443, 24, 1825, 9, 7, 5, 64, 43, 3446, 242, 125, 16, 17814, 241, 23, 832, 3, 548, 637, 3446, 4, 386, 2925, 20, 2147, 1211, 469, 1200, 26, 414, 7259, 2764, 363, 2, 211, 816, 5, 24, 228, 7, 346, 3301, 60945, 103, 232, 24, 410, 296, 2273, 1, 312, 4758, 548, 5970, 349, 2529, 2969, 2147, 1211, 672, 315, 3767, 347, 29, 5075, 7, 11, 786, 23, 218, 13, 2, 218, 39, 1, 417, 14, 3767, 29, 8, 1363, 1, 465, 7, 42, 1262, 478, 3496, 1, 2969, 2147, 1211, 190, 417, 39, 347, 11, 311, 20, 1412, 1914, 9, 30940, 27125, 60946, 2, 6861, 2, 211, 363, 4430, 31901, 33, 1430, 417, 14, 218, 39, 3767, 347, 5, 218, 13, 3767, 347, 365, 1, 365, 363, 952, 109, 12695, 11, 97, 142, 3, 707, 4, 675, 2, 313, 1591, 837, 1, 31901, 33, 109, 12695, 438, 5, 91, 115, 25, 300, 19, 4247, 2, 19, 2155, 106, 8, 658, 65, 108, 602, 31901, 33, 109, 12695, 2, 4593, 3458, 2593, 733, 153, 1232, 22, 109, 306, 177, 130, 9, 300, 547, 419, 328, 1112, 90, 36, 348, 1182, 3001, 2723, 2574, 228, 977, 365, 7, 54, 103, 2969, 2147, 1211, 28, 417, 14, 2, 478, 2147, 1211, 28, 417, 39, 42, 97, 299, 31901, 33, 363, 50, 478, 2147, 1211, 4, 748, 676, 7, 54, 103, 2969, 2147, 1211, 28, 110, 410, 42, 1279, 31901, 33, 363, 2147, 1211, 277, 2764, 363, 4, 386, 16, 41, 5, 231, 69, 228, 26, 363, 10, 80, 2235, 198, 2147, 1211, 10, 447, 20, 3, 2969, 5841, 3496, 1, 478, 5841]",1800.0,22203761,361
A three-gene expression signature model for risk stratification of patients with neuroblastoma.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2012-02-10,"Neuroblastoma is an embryonal tumor with contrasting clinical courses. Despite elaborate stratification strategies, precise clinical risk assessment still remains a challenge. The purpose of this study was to develop a PCR-based predictor model to improve clinical risk assessment of patients with neuroblastoma. The model was developed using real-time PCR gene expression data from 96 samples and tested on separate expression data sets obtained from real-time PCR and microarray studies comprising 362 patients. On the basis of our prior study of differentially expressed genes in favorable and unfavorable neuroblastoma subgroups, we identified three genes, CHD5, PAFAH1B1, and NME1, strongly associated with patient outcome. The expression pattern of these genes was used to develop a PCR-based single-score predictor model. The model discriminated patients into two groups with significantly different clinical outcome [set 1: 5-year overall survival (OS): 0.93 ± 0.03 vs. 0.53 ± 0.06, 5-year event-free survival (EFS): 0.85 ± 0.04 vs. 0.042 ± 0.06, both P < 0.001; set 2 OS: 0.97 ± 0.02 vs. 0.61 ± 0.1, P = 0.005, EFS: 0.91 ± 0.8 vs. 0.56 ± 0.1, P = 0.005; and set 3 OS: 0.99 ± 0.01 vs. 0.56 ± 0.06, EFS: 0.96 ± 0.02 vs. 0.43 ± 0.05, both P < 0.001]. Multivariate analysis showed that the model was an independent marker for survival (P < 0.001, for all). In comparison with accepted risk stratification systems, the model robustly classified patients in the total cohort and in different clinically relevant risk subgroups. We propose for the first time in neuroblastoma, a technically simple PCR-based predictor model that could help refine current risk stratification systems.",Journal Article,2902.0,31.0,is an embryonal tumor with contrasting clinical courses Despite elaborate stratification strategies precise clinical risk assessment still remains a challenge The purpose of this study was to develop a PCR-based predictor model to improve clinical risk assessment of patients with The model was developed using real-time PCR gene expression data from 96 samples and tested on separate expression data sets obtained from real-time PCR and microarray studies comprising 362 patients On the basis of our prior study of differentially expressed genes in favorable and unfavorable subgroups we identified three genes CHD5 PAFAH1B1 and NME1 strongly associated with patient outcome The expression pattern of these genes was used to develop a PCR-based single-score predictor model The model discriminated patients into two groups with significantly different clinical outcome set 1 5-year overall survival OS 0.93 ± 0.03 vs. 0.53 ± 0.06 5-year event-free survival EFS 0.85 ± 0.04 vs. 0.042 ± 0.06 both P 0.001 set 2 OS 0.97 ± 0.02 vs. 0.61 ± 0.1 P 0.005 EFS 0.91 ± 0.8 vs. 0.56 ± 0.1 P 0.005 and set 3 OS 0.99 ± 0.01 vs. 0.56 ± 0.06 EFS 0.96 ± 0.02 vs. 0.43 ± 0.05 both P 0.001 Multivariate analysis showed that the model was an independent marker for survival P 0.001 for all In comparison with accepted risk stratification systems the model robustly classified patients in the total cohort and in different clinically relevant risk subgroups We propose for the first time in a technically simple PCR-based predictor model that could help refine current risk stratification systems,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[16, 35, 5239, 30, 5, 14116, 38, 1993, 550, 16764, 1541, 422, 3260, 38, 43, 455, 1234, 469, 8, 1745, 3, 743, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 690, 8, 604, 90, 980, 202, 6, 401, 38, 43, 455, 1, 7, 5, 3, 202, 10, 276, 75, 1589, 98, 604, 145, 55, 74, 29, 921, 347, 2, 650, 23, 2282, 55, 74, 2270, 683, 29, 1589, 98, 604, 2, 1727, 94, 3538, 10530, 7, 23, 3, 877, 1, 114, 324, 45, 1, 2478, 570, 214, 4, 913, 2, 2483, 1453, 21, 108, 169, 214, 16979, 39897, 2, 30753, 1327, 41, 5, 69, 228, 3, 55, 1177, 1, 46, 214, 10, 95, 6, 690, 8, 604, 90, 226, 368, 980, 202, 3, 202, 8752, 7, 237, 100, 271, 5, 97, 338, 38, 228, 916, 14, 33, 111, 63, 25, 118, 13, 966, 810, 13, 680, 105, 13, 699, 810, 13, 1460, 33, 111, 774, 115, 25, 1683, 13, 772, 810, 13, 755, 105, 13, 5606, 810, 13, 1460, 110, 19, 13, 144, 916, 18, 118, 13, 1015, 810, 13, 588, 105, 13, 713, 810, 13, 14, 19, 13, 1614, 1683, 13, 970, 810, 13, 66, 105, 13, 664, 810, 13, 14, 19, 13, 1614, 2, 916, 27, 118, 13, 1058, 810, 13, 355, 105, 13, 664, 810, 13, 1460, 1683, 13, 921, 810, 13, 588, 105, 13, 601, 810, 13, 474, 110, 19, 13, 144, 331, 65, 224, 17, 3, 202, 10, 35, 306, 952, 9, 25, 19, 13, 144, 9, 62, 4, 1155, 5, 3058, 43, 1541, 1530, 3, 202, 8547, 1373, 7, 4, 3, 181, 180, 2, 4, 338, 505, 867, 43, 1453, 21, 2548, 9, 3, 157, 98, 4, 8, 6093, 2763, 604, 90, 980, 202, 17, 359, 987, 5003, 291, 43, 1541, 1530]",1576.0,22328561,289
Tumor dosimetry using [124I]m-iodobenzylguanidine microPET/CT for [131I]m-iodobenzylguanidine treatment of neuroblastoma in a murine xenograft model.,Molecular imaging and biology,Mol Imaging Biol,2012-12-01,"[(124)I]m-iodobenzylguanidine ((124)I-mIBG) provides a quantitative tool for pretherapy tumor imaging and dosimetry when performed before [(131)I]m-iodobenzylguanidine ((131)I-mIBG) targeted radionuclide therapy of neuroblastoma. (124)I (T (1/2) = 4.2 days) has a comparable half-life to that of (131)I (T (1/2) = 8.02 days) and can be imaged by positron emission tomography (PET) for accurate quantification of the radiotracer distribution. We estimated expected radiation dose in tumors from (131)I-mIBG therapy using (124)I-mIBG microPET/CT imaging data in a murine xenograft model of neuroblastoma transduced to express high levels of the human norepinephrine transporter (hNET). In order to enhance mIBG uptake for in vivo imaging and therapy, NB 1691-luciferase (NB1691) human neuroblastoma cells were engineered to express high levels of hNET protein by lentiviral transduction (NB1691-hNET). Both NB1691 and NB1691-hNET cells were implanted subcutaneously and into renal capsules in athymic mice. (124)I-mIBG (4.2-6.5 MBq) was administered intravenously for microPET/CT imaging at 5 time points over 95 h (0.5, 3-5, 24, 48, and 93-95 h median time points). In vivo biodistribution data in normal organs, tumors, and whole-body were collected from reconstructed PET images corrected for photon attenuation using the CT-based attenuation map. Organ and tumor dosimetry were determined for (124)I-mIBG. Dose estimates for (131)I-mIBG were made, assuming the same in vivo biodistribution as (124)I-mIBG. All NB1691-hNET tumors had significant uptake and retention of (124)I-mIBG, whereas unmodified NB1691 tumors did not demonstrate quantifiable mIBG uptake in vivo, despite in vitro uptake. (124)I-mIBG with microPET/CT provided an accurate three-dimensional tool for estimating the radiation dose that would be delivered with (131)I-mIBG therapy. For example, in our model system, we estimated that the administration of (131)I-mIBG in the range of 52.8-206 MBq would deliver 20 Gy to tumors.

Association of age at diagnosis and genetic mutations in patients with neuroblastoma.,JAMA,JAMA,2012-03-01,"Neuroblastoma is diagnosed over a wide age range from birth through young adulthood, and older age at diagnosis is associated with a decline in survivability. To identify genetic mutations that are associated with age at diagnosis in patients with metastatic neuroblastoma. Whole genome sequencing was performed on DNA from diagnostic tumors and their matched germlines from 40 patients with metastatic neuroblastoma obtained between 1987 and 2009. Age groups at diagnosis included infants (0-<18 months), children (18 months-<12 years), and adolescents and young adults (≥12 years). To confirm the findings from this discovery cohort, validation testing using tumors from an additional 64 patients obtained between 1985 and 2009 also was performed. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue was used for immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Telomere lengths were analyzed using whole genome sequencing data, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and fluorescent in situ hybridization. Somatic recurrent mutations in tumors from patients with neuroblastoma correlated with the age at diagnosis and telomere length. In the discovery cohort (n = 40), mutations in the ATRX gene were identified in 100% (95% CI, 50%-100%) of tumors from patients in the adolescent and young adult group (5 of 5), in 17% (95% CI, 7%-36%) of tumors from children (5 of 29), and 0% (95% CI, 0%-40%) of tumors from infants (0 of 6). In the validation cohort (n = 64), mutations in the ATRX gene were identified in 33% (95% CI, 17%-54%) of tumors from patients in the adolescent and young adult group (9 of 27), in 16% (95% CI, 6%-35%) of tumors from children (4 of 25), and in 0% (95% CI, 0%-24%) of tumors from infants (0 of 12). In both cohorts (N = 104), mutations in the ATRX gene were identified in 44% (95% CI, 28%-62%) of tumors from patients in the adolescent and young adult group (14 of 32), in 17% (95% CI, 9%-29%) of tumors from children (9 of 54), and in 0% (95% CI, 0%-17%) of tumors from infants (0 of 18). ATRX mutations were associated with an absence of the ATRX protein in the nucleus and with long telomeres.

Cancer Res.,2012-03-15,"(131)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is a targeted radiopharmaceutical with activity in patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma. Irinotecan is a known radiosensitizer with activity in neuroblastoma. This phase I study aimed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose of MIBG together with fixed doses of vincristine and irinotecan. Patients 1 to 30 years old with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma and MIBG-avid tumors were eligible. All patients had autologous hematopoietic stem cells (PBSC) available and met standard phase I organ function requirements. Irinotecan (20 mg/m(2)/dose IV) was given on days 0 to 4 and 7 to 11, with vincristine (1.5 mg/m(2) IV) on days 0 and 7. MIBG was given on day 1 following a 3 + 3 phase I dose escalation design starting at 8 mCi/kg MIBG. PBSCs were administered at dose level 8 mCi/kg for prolonged myelosuppression and for all patients at 12 mCi/kg or more. Twenty-four patients evaluable for dose escalation (median age, 6.7 years; range, 1.9-26.8 years) received 1 (n = 17), 2 (n = 5), or 3 (n = 2) cycles of therapy. Myelosuppression and diarrhea were the most common toxicities.

Secondary objectives focused on other low-risk patients with NBL and on those who required chemotherapy according to protocol-defined criteria. Patients underwent maximally safe resection of tumor. Chemotherapy was reserved for patients with, or at risk for, symptomatic disease, with less than 50% tumor resection at diagnosis, or with unresectable progressive disease after surgery alone. For all 915 eligible patients, 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and OS were 89% ± 1% and 97% ± 1%, respectively. For patients with asymptomatic stage 2a or 2b disease, 5-year EFS and OS were 87% ± 2% and 96% ± 1%, respectively. Among patients with stage 2b disease, EFS and OS were significantly lower for those with unfavorable histology or diploid tumors, and OS was significantly lower for those ≥ 18 months old. For patients with stage 1 and 4s NBL, 5-year OS rates were 99% ± 1% and 91% ± 1%, respectively. Patients who required chemotherapy at diagnosis achieved 5-year OS of 98% ± 1%. Of all patients observed after surgery, 11.1% experienced recurrence or progression of disease. Excellent survival rates can be achieved in asymptomatic low-risk patients with stages 2a and 2b NBL after surgery alone. Immediate use of chemotherapy may be restricted to a minority of patients with low-risk NBL. Patients with stage 2b disease who are older or have diploid or unfavorable histology tumors fare less well. Future studies will seek to refine risk classification.","Clinical Trial, Phase III",2829.0,77.0,The primary objective of Children 's Oncology Group study P9641 was to demonstrate that surgery alone would achieve 3-year overall survival OS ≥ 95 for patients with asymptomatic International Staging System stages 2a and 2b NBL Secondary objectives focused on other low-risk patients with NBL and on those who required chemotherapy according to protocol-defined criteria Patients underwent maximally safe resection of tumor Chemotherapy was reserved for patients with or at risk for symptomatic disease with less than 50 tumor resection at diagnosis or with unresectable progressive disease after surgery alone For all 915 eligible patients 5-year event-free survival EFS and OS were 89 ± 1 and 97 ± 1 respectively For patients with asymptomatic stage 2a or 2b disease 5-year EFS and OS were 87 ± 2 and 96 ± 1 respectively Among patients with stage 2b disease EFS and OS were significantly lower for those with unfavorable histology or diploid tumors and OS was significantly lower for those ≥ 18 months old For patients with stage 1 and 4s NBL 5-year OS rates were 99 ± 1 and 91 ± 1 respectively Patients who required chemotherapy at diagnosis achieved 5-year OS of 98 ± 1 Of all patients observed after surgery 11.1 experienced recurrence or progression of disease Excellent survival rates can be achieved in asymptomatic low-risk patients with stages 2a and 2b NBL after surgery alone Immediate use of chemotherapy may be restricted to a minority of patients with low-risk NBL Patients with stage 2b disease who are older or have diploid or unfavorable histology tumors fare less well Future studies will seek to refine risk classification,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 86, 461, 1, 541, 292, 413, 87, 45, 61377, 10, 6, 608, 17, 152, 279, 688, 1359, 27, 111, 63, 25, 118, 749, 48, 9, 7, 5, 2100, 944, 632, 398, 1153, 4707, 2, 3381, 12032, 568, 2409, 1649, 23, 127, 154, 43, 7, 5, 12032, 2, 23, 135, 54, 616, 56, 768, 6, 1182, 395, 371, 7, 208, 6402, 1165, 170, 1, 30, 56, 10, 6468, 9, 7, 5, 15, 28, 43, 9, 1704, 34, 5, 299, 76, 212, 30, 170, 28, 147, 15, 5, 1468, 1014, 34, 50, 152, 279, 9, 62, 13644, 625, 7, 33, 111, 774, 115, 25, 1683, 2, 118, 11, 887, 810, 14, 2, 1015, 810, 14, 106, 9, 7, 5, 2100, 82, 4707, 15, 3381, 34, 33, 111, 1683, 2, 118, 11, 912, 810, 18, 2, 921, 810, 14, 106, 107, 7, 5, 82, 3381, 34, 1683, 2, 118, 11, 97, 280, 9, 135, 5, 2483, 784, 15, 6815, 57, 2, 118, 10, 97, 280, 9, 135, 749, 203, 53, 1095, 9, 7, 5, 82, 14, 2, 11987, 12032, 33, 111, 118, 151, 11, 1058, 810, 14, 2, 970, 810, 14, 106, 7, 54, 616, 56, 28, 147, 513, 33, 111, 118, 1, 1096, 810, 14, 1, 62, 7, 164, 50, 152, 175, 14, 592, 146, 15, 91, 1, 34, 1503, 25, 151, 122, 40, 513, 4, 2100, 154, 43, 7, 5, 1153, 4707, 2, 3381, 12032, 50, 152, 279, 2181, 119, 1, 56, 68, 40, 2016, 6, 8, 2652, 1, 7, 5, 154, 43, 12032, 7, 5, 82, 3381, 34, 54, 32, 434, 15, 47, 6815, 15, 2483, 784, 57, 11470, 299, 149, 508, 94, 303, 6606, 6, 5003, 43, 947]",1643.0,22529259,275

Clin. Oncol.,2012-04-30,"Treatment outcome for black patients with cancer has been significantly worse than for their white counterparts. We determined whether recent improved treatment had narrowed the gap in outcome between black and white pediatric patients. In a parallel comparison, we analyzed survival by disease category between black and white patients with childhood cancer registered in one of the 17 cancer registries of the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program or treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital, which provides comprehensive treatment to all patients regardless of their ability to pay, from 1992 to 2000 and from 2001 to 2007. Analysis of the SEER data indicated that in both study periods, black patients had significantly poorer rates of survival than did white patients, with the exception of a few types of cancer. Despite significantly improved treatment outcomes for patients who were treated from 2001 to 2007, the racial difference in survival has actually widened for acute myeloid leukemia and neuroblastoma. By contrast, in the cohorts treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital, there were no significant differences in survival between black and white patients in either study period, regardless of the cancer type. Importantly, the outcome of treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and retinoblastoma has improved in parallel for both races during the most recent study period.

Dose escalation study of no-carrier-added 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine for relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma: new approaches to neuroblastoma therapy consortium trial.,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",J. Nucl. Med.,2012-06-14,"(131)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is specifically taken up in neuroblastoma, with a response rate of 20%-37% in relapsed disease. Nonradioactive carrier MIBG molecules inhibit uptake of (131)I-MIBG, theoretically resulting in less tumor radiation and increased risk of cardiovascular toxicity. Our aim was to establish the maximum tolerated dose of no-carrier-added (NCA) (131)I-MIBG, with secondary aims of assessing tumor and organ dosimetry and overall response. Eligible patients were 1-30 y old with resistant neuroblastoma, (131)I-MIBG uptake, and cryopreserved hematopoietic stem cells. A diagnostic dose of NCA (131)I-MIBG was followed by 3 dosimetry scans to assess radiation dose to critical organs and soft-tissue tumors. The treatment dose of NCA (131)I-MIBG (specific activity, 165 MBq/μg) was adjusted as necessary on the basis of critical organ tolerance limits. Autologous hematopoietic stem cells were infused 14 d after therapy to abrogate prolonged myelosuppression. Response and toxicity were evaluated on day 60. The NCA (131)I-MIBG was escalated from 444 to 777 MBq/kg (12-21 mCi/kg) using a 3 + 3 design. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was failure to reconstitute neutrophils to greater than 500/μL within 28 d or platelets to greater than 20,000/μL within 56 d, or grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0) except for predefined exclusions. Three patients each were evaluable at 444, 555, and 666 MBq/kg without DLT. The dose of 777 MBq/kg dose was not feasible because of organ dosimetry limits; however, 3 assigned patients were evaluable for a received dose of 666 MBq/kg, providing a total of 6 patients evaluable for toxicity at 666 MBq/kg without DLT. Mean whole-body radiation was 0.23 mGy/MBq, and mean organ doses were 0.92, 0.82, and 1.2 mGy/MBq of MIBG for the liver, lung, and kidney, respectively. Eight patients had 13 soft-tissue lesions with tumor-absorbed doses of 26-378 Gy.

Anti-CD3 × anti-GD2 bispecific antibody redirects T-cell cytolytic activity to neuroblastoma targets.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2012-06-15,The ganglioside GD2 is an attractive target for immunotherapy of neuroectodermal tumors. We tested a unique bispecific antibody anti-CD3 × anti-GD2 (3F8BiAb) for its ability to redirect activated T cells (ATC) to target GD2-positive neuroblastomas. ATC were generated from normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by stimulating the PBMC with OKT3 and expanding the T cells in the presence of interleukin 2 (IL-2) for 14 days. ATC were armed with 3F8BiAb (100 ng/10(6)  cells) or Her2BiAb (50 ng/10(6)  cells) prior to use. 3F8 BiAb were tested for its dual-binding specificity to GD2 expressed on cancer cell lines and CD3 expressed on ATC. 3F8BiAb-armed ATC were further tested ex vivo for their cytotoxicity against GD2 positive tumor targets and its ability to induce cytokine response upon binding to targets. GD2 expression in neuroblastoma cells was confirmed by FACS analysis.

Feasibility of a tandem autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant regimen for high risk neuroblastoma in a cooperative group setting: a Pediatric Oncology Group study: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2012-06-28,"The Pediatric Oncology Group performed a pilot study to assess the feasibility of tandem high dose chemotherapy (HDC) with stem cell rescue (HDC/SCR). We report here the results of this single arm trial of induction chemotherapy, local control measures (surgery and local radiation), and tandem HDC/SCR. Patients with high risk neuroblastoma (NBL) underwent five cycles of induction chemotherapy and resection of primary tumors. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) were collected after Course 3 without exvivo manipulation. Myeloablative chemotherapy was performed in rapid sequence after induction chemotherapy and surgery. The ability of patients to complete both cycles of HDC/SCR was a primary endpoint. Transplant-related toxicity, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were recorded. A total of 33 patients were enrolled. Twenty-two patients completed at least one HDC/SCR procedure and 17 patients completed both. Only one patient had insufficient stem cells collected for both transplants. There was one transplant-related death; engraftment was rapid and toxicity was as expected. The PFS of the 33 patients treated on this study is 24.2% ± 7.5% and OS is 36.4% ± 8.4% at 5 years. For patients who received at least one transplant PFS is 36.4% ± 11.0% and OS is 45.5% ± 11.2% at 5 years. The treatment of high risk NBL with tandem HDC/SCR is feasible in terms of transplant-related mortality and the ability to collect adequate PBSC for two transplants.

"Truncated DNMT3B isoform DNMT3B7 suppresses growth, induces differentiation, and alters DNA methylation in human neuroblastoma.",Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2012-07-18,"Epigenetic changes in pediatric neuroblastoma may contribute to the aggressive pathophysiology of this disease, but little is known about the basis for such changes. In this study, we examined a role for the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B, in particular, the truncated isoform DNMT3B7, which is generated frequently in cancer. To investigate if aberrant DNMT3B transcripts alter DNA methylation, gene expression, and phenotypic character in neuroblastoma, we measured DNMT3B expression in primary tumors. Higher levels of DNMT3B7 were detected in differentiated ganglioneuroblastomas compared to undifferentiated neuroblastomas, suggesting that expression of DNMT3B7 may induce a less aggressive clinical phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of enforced DNMT3B7 expression in neuroblastoma cells, finding a significant inhibition of cell proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo. DNMT3B7-positive cells had higher levels of total genomic methylation and a dramatic decrease in expression of the FOS and JUN family members that comprise AP1 transcription factors. Consistent with an established antagonistic relationship between AP1 expression and retinoic acid receptor activity, increased differentiation was seen in the DNMT3B7-expressing neuroblastoma cells following treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) compared to controls. Our results indicate that DNMT3B7 modifies the epigenome in neuroblastoma cells to induce changes in gene expression, inhibit tumor growth, and increase sensitivity to ATRA.",Journal Article,2743.0,23.0,Epigenetic changes in pediatric may contribute to the aggressive pathophysiology of this disease but little is known about the basis for such changes In this study we examined a role for the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B in particular the truncated isoform DNMT3B7 which is generated frequently in cancer To investigate if aberrant DNMT3B transcripts alter DNA methylation gene expression and phenotypic character in we measured DNMT3B expression in primary tumors Higher levels of DNMT3B7 were detected in differentiated ganglioneuroblastomas compared to undifferentiated neuroblastomas suggesting that expression of DNMT3B7 may induce a less aggressive clinical phenotype To test this hypothesis we investigated the effects of enforced DNMT3B7 expression in cells finding a significant inhibition of cell proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo DNMT3B7-positive cells had higher levels of total genomic methylation and a dramatic decrease in expression of the FOS and JUN family members that comprise AP1 transcription factors Consistent with an established antagonistic relationship between AP1 expression and retinoic acid receptor activity increased differentiation was seen in the DNMT3B7-expressing cells following treatment with all-trans retinoic acid ATRA compared to controls Our results indicate that DNMT3B7 modifies the epigenome in cells to induce changes in gene expression inhibit tumor growth and increase sensitivity to ATRA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1418, 400, 4, 815, 68, 1248, 6, 3, 571, 4320, 1, 26, 34, 84, 1215, 16, 440, 545, 3, 877, 9, 225, 400, 4, 26, 45, 21, 409, 8, 200, 9, 3, 261, 3747, 8819, 4, 1454, 3, 6502, 3995, 15395, 92, 16, 1419, 746, 4, 12, 6, 963, 492, 1898, 8819, 2680, 2688, 261, 569, 145, 55, 2, 3290, 15591, 4, 21, 644, 8819, 55, 4, 86, 57, 142, 148, 1, 15395, 11, 530, 4, 1442, 61683, 72, 6, 4480, 8915, 802, 17, 55, 1, 15395, 68, 1290, 8, 299, 571, 38, 1005, 6, 412, 26, 1492, 21, 565, 3, 176, 1, 7807, 15395, 55, 4, 37, 1567, 8, 93, 297, 1, 31, 457, 4, 439, 2, 1056, 2, 30, 129, 4, 386, 15395, 109, 37, 42, 142, 148, 1, 181, 572, 569, 2, 8, 3079, 775, 4, 55, 1, 3, 9737, 2, 4578, 607, 1684, 17, 5238, 21055, 866, 130, 925, 5, 35, 635, 9863, 858, 59, 21055, 55, 2, 3887, 971, 153, 128, 101, 910, 10, 527, 4, 3, 15395, 1046, 37, 366, 24, 5, 62, 3437, 3887, 971, 2822, 72, 6, 535, 114, 99, 1008, 17, 15395, 11039, 3, 10206, 4, 37, 6, 1290, 400, 4, 145, 55, 1433, 30, 129, 2, 344, 485, 6, 2822]",1467.0,22815530,76

Invest.,2012-08-06,"Survival outcomes for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) have significantly improved with anti-disialoganglioside GD2 mAb therapy, which promotes NK cell activation through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. NK cell activation requires an interaction between inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and HLA class I ligands. NK cells lacking KIRs that are specific for self HLA are therefore ""unlicensed"" and hyporesponsive. mAb-treated NB patients lacking HLA class I ligands for their inhibitory KIRs have significantly higher survival rates, suggesting that NK cells expressing KIRs for non-self HLA are mediating tumor control in these individuals. We found that, in the presence of mAb, both licensed and unlicensed NK cells are highly activated in vitro. However, HLA class I expression on NB cell lines selectively inhibited licensed NK cell activity, permitting primarily unlicensed NK cells to mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

Murine anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody 3F8 combined with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and 13-cis-retinoic acid in high-risk patients with stage 4 neuroblastoma in first remission.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2012-08-06,"Anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) combined with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has shown efficacy against neuroblastoma (NB). Prognostic variables that could influence clinical outcome were explored. One hundred sixty-nine children diagnosed with stage 4 NB (1988 to 2008) were enrolled onto consecutive anti-GD2 murine MoAb 3F8 ± GM-CSF ± 13-cis-retinoic acid (CRA) protocols after achieving first remission (complete remission/very good partial remission). Patients enrolled in regimen A (n = 43 high-risk [HR] patients) received 3F8 alone; regimen B (n = 41 HR patients), 3F8 + intravenous GM-CSF + CRA, after stem-cell transplantation (SCT); and regimen C (n = 85), 3F8 + subcutaneous GM-CSF + CRA, 46 of 85 after SCT, whereas 28 of 85 required additional induction therapy and were deemed ultra high risk (UHR). Marrow minimal residual disease (MRD) was measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Survival probability was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and prognostic variables were analyzed by multivariate Cox regression model. At 5 years from the start of immunotherapy, progression-free survival (PFS) improved from 44% for HR patients receiving regimen A to 56% and 62% for those receiving regimens B and C, respectively. Overall survival (OS) was 49%, 61%, and 81%, respectively. PFS and OS of UHR patients were 36% and 75%, respectively. Relapse was mostly at isolated sites.

"Ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide for neuroblastoma: a high-dose salvage regimen and review of the literature.",Cancer,Cancer,2012-09-05,"The authors report a retrospective analysis of high-dose ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (HD-ICE) for patients with refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma (NB). A major reason for using this regimen was the long time since patients received previous treatment with a platinum compound. The authors also summarized the published experience on ICE in patients with NB. Treatment comprised ifosfamide (2000 mg/m(2) daily for 5 days), carboplatin (500 mg/m(2) daily for 2 days), and etoposide (100 mg/m(2) daily for 5 days). Patients who had poor hematologic reserve (platelet count <100,000/μL) from previous therapy received peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) after HD-ICE. Disease status before and after HD-ICE was defined according to International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (expanded to include (123) I-metaiodobenzylguanidine findings). Publications that were informative about ICE for NB were reviewed. Seventy-four patients received 92 cycles of ICE, including 37 patients who received PBSC rescue. Grade 3 toxicities were rare: 1-3 patients had encephalopathy, mucositis, or gastroenteritis. Bacteremia was documented in 24 of 92 cycles (26%). The absolute neutrophil count reached 500/μL on day 17-30 (median, day 22) in patients who had satisfactory hematologic reserve. Disease regressions (major and minor responses) were achieved by 14 of 17 patients (82%) with a new relapse, 13 of 26 patients (50%) with refractory NB, and 12 of 34 patients (35%) who were treated for progressive disease during chemotherapy (P = .005). In the literature, patients received ICE at lower dosages and achieved major response rates >36% in phase 1 and 2 studies (in which less comprehensive staging evaluations were used) that involved resistant NB and >70% in induction for newly diagnosed NB. HD-ICE is appealing as salvage treatment or consolidative therapy because of its anti-NB activity and the low risk of major nonhematologic toxicity.

A prospective study of expectant observation as primary therapy for neuroblastoma in young infants: a Children's Oncology Group study.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2012-10-01,"To demonstrate that expectant observation of young infants with small adrenal masses would result in excellent event-free and overall survival. Neuroblastoma is the most common malignant tumor in infants, and in young infants, 90% of neuroblastomas are located in the adrenal gland. Although surgical resection is standard therapy, multiple observations suggest that expectant observation could be a safe alternative for infants younger than 6 months who have small adrenal masses. A prospective study of infants younger than 6 months with small adrenal masses and no evidence of spreading beyond the primary tumor was performed at participating Children's Oncology Group institutions. Parents could choose observation or immediate surgical resection. Serial abdominal sonograms and urinary vanillylmandelic acid and homovanillic acid measurements were performed during a 90-week interval. Infants experiencing a 50% increase in the volume of the mass, urine catecholamine values, or an increase in the homovanillic acid to vanillylmandelic acid ratio greater than 2, were referred for surgical resection. Eighty-seven eligible patients were enrolled: 83 elected observation and 4 chose immediate surgery. Sixteen observational patients ultimately had surgery; 8 had International Neuroblastoma Staging System stage 1 neuroblastoma, 2 had higher staged neuroblastoma (2B and 4S), 2 had low-grade adrenocortical neoplasm, 2 had adrenal hemorrhage, and 2 had extralobar pulmonary sequestration. The 2 patients with adrenocortical tumors were resected because of a more than 50% increase in tumor volume. The 3-year event-free survival for a neuroblastoma event was 97.7 ± 2.2% within the entire cohort of patients (n = 87). The 3-year overall survival was 100%, with a median follow-up of 3.2 years.

"Targeting ALK: a promising strategy for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and neuroblastoma.",Targeted oncology,Target Oncol,2012-09-12,"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a tyrosine kinase receptor that affects a number of biological and biochemical functions through normal ligand-dependent signaling. It has oncogenic functions in a number of tumors including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and neuroblastoma when altered by translocation or amplification or mutation.

Clinical responses to selumetinib (AZD6244; ARRY-142886)-based combination therapy stratified by gene mutations in patients with metastatic melanoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2012-09-12,"The high prevalence of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) and neuroblastoma v-ras oncogene homolog (NRAS) mutations in melanoma provides a strong rationale to test the clinical efficacy of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibition in this disease. The authors hypothesized that the presence of BRAF or NRAS mutations would correlate with clinical benefit among patients who received treatment with combination regimens that included the MEK inhibitor selumetinib. BRAF and NRAS mutation status was determined retrospectively in available tissue specimens from patients with melanoma who were enrolled in a phase 1 trial of selumetinib in combination with 1 of 4 drugs (dacarbazine, docetaxel, temsirolimus, or erlotinib). The clinical response rate and the time to progression (TTP) were assessed as a function of BRAF and NRAS mutation status. Among 18 patients analyzed, 9 patients (50%) harbored a BRAF mutation (8 had a valine-to-glutamic acid substitution at residue 600 [V600E]; 1 had an arginine nonsense mutation at residue 603 [R603]), 4 patients (22%) harbored an NRAS mutation (2 had a glutamine-to-arginine substitution at residue 61 [Q61R], 1 had a glutamine-to-lysine substitution at residue 61 [Q61K], and 1 had a glycine-to-lysine substitution at residue 12 [G12S]), and 5 patient (28%) had the wild type of both genes. These mutations were mutually exclusive. Among the 9 patients who had BRAF mutations, 5 patients (56%) achieved a partial response, and 4 patients (44%) achieved stable disease for at least 6 weeks. No patient with the wild-type BRAF gene achieved a clinical response (P = .01 vs patients with BRAF mutations). The presence of an NRAS mutation did not correlate with the clinical response rate. The presence of a BRAF mutation was correlated significantly with the TTP in a multivariate model (hazard ratio, 0.22; P = .02 vs wild-type BRAF). Higher response rates and longer TTP were observed with selumetinib-containing regimens in patients who had tumors that harbored a BRAF mutation compared with patients who had wild-type BRAF.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",2687.0,42.0,The high prevalence of v-raf murine viral oncogene homolog B1 BRAF and v-ras oncogene homolog NRAS mutations in provides a strong rationale to test the clinical efficacy of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase MEK inhibition in this disease The authors hypothesized that the presence of BRAF or NRAS mutations would correlate with clinical benefit among patients who received treatment with combination regimens that included the MEK inhibitor selumetinib BRAF and NRAS mutation status was determined retrospectively in available tissue specimens from patients with who were enrolled in a phase 1 trial of selumetinib in combination with 1 of 4 drugs dacarbazine docetaxel temsirolimus or erlotinib The clinical response rate and the time to progression TTP were assessed as a function of BRAF and NRAS mutation status Among 18 patients analyzed 9 patients 50 harbored a BRAF mutation 8 had a valine-to-glutamic acid substitution at residue 600 V600E 1 had an arginine nonsense mutation at residue 603 R603 4 patients 22 harbored an NRAS mutation 2 had a glutamine-to-arginine substitution at residue 61 Q61R 1 had a glutamine-to-lysine substitution at residue 61 Q61K and 1 had a glycine-to-lysine substitution at residue 12 G12S and 5 patient 28 had the wild type of both genes These mutations were mutually exclusive Among the 9 patients who had BRAF mutations 5 patients 56 achieved a partial response and 4 patients 44 achieved stable disease for at least 6 weeks No patient with the wild-type BRAF gene achieved a clinical response P .01 vs patients with BRAF mutations The presence of an NRAS mutation did not correlate with the clinical response rate The presence of a BRAF mutation was correlated significantly with the TTP in a multivariate model hazard ratio 0.22 P .02 vs wild-type BRAF Higher response rates and longer TTP were observed with selumetinib-containing regimens in patients who had tumors that harbored a BRAF mutation compared with patients who had wild-type BRAF,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 64, 1078, 1, 603, 2212, 1471, 1667, 1836, 3412, 7018, 566, 2, 603, 1102, 1836, 3412, 2845, 138, 4, 777, 8, 1082, 1728, 6, 412, 3, 38, 209, 1, 2625, 735, 178, 216, 216, 1693, 297, 4, 26, 34, 3, 738, 1237, 17, 3, 463, 1, 566, 15, 2845, 138, 688, 1513, 5, 38, 247, 107, 7, 54, 103, 24, 5, 150, 472, 17, 159, 3, 1693, 230, 4626, 566, 2, 2845, 258, 156, 10, 509, 894, 4, 390, 246, 623, 29, 7, 5, 54, 11, 346, 4, 8, 124, 14, 160, 1, 4626, 4, 150, 5, 14, 1, 39, 600, 3404, 621, 2831, 15, 962, 3, 38, 51, 116, 2, 3, 98, 6, 91, 2422, 11, 275, 22, 8, 343, 1, 566, 2, 2845, 258, 156, 107, 203, 7, 311, 83, 7, 212, 3253, 8, 566, 258, 66, 42, 8, 12255, 6, 12727, 971, 5029, 28, 7840, 2383, 2047, 14, 42, 35, 5392, 9168, 258, 28, 7840, 9696, 61880, 39, 7, 350, 3253, 35, 2845, 258, 18, 42, 8, 6425, 6, 5392, 5029, 28, 7840, 713, 26371, 14, 42, 8, 6425, 6, 6041, 5029, 28, 7840, 713, 24797, 2, 14, 42, 8, 12280, 6, 6041, 5029, 28, 7840, 133, 18026, 2, 33, 69, 339, 42, 3, 955, 267, 1, 110, 214, 46, 138, 11, 5575, 4804, 107, 3, 83, 7, 54, 42, 566, 138, 33, 7, 664, 513, 8, 450, 51, 2, 39, 7, 584, 513, 585, 34, 9, 28, 506, 49, 244, 77, 69, 5, 3, 955, 267, 566, 145, 513, 8, 38, 51, 19, 355, 105, 7, 5, 566, 138, 3, 463, 1, 35, 2845, 258, 205, 44, 1513, 5, 3, 38, 51, 116, 3, 463, 1, 8, 566, 258, 10, 438, 97, 5, 3, 2422, 4, 8, 331, 202, 360, 197, 13, 350, 19, 588, 105, 955, 267, 566, 142, 51, 151, 2, 589, 2422, 11, 164, 5, 4626, 1101, 472, 4, 7, 54, 42, 57, 17, 3253, 8, 566, 258, 72, 5, 7, 54, 42, 955, 267, 566]",1992.0,22972589,165
Oncogenic NRAS signaling differentially regulates survival and proliferation in melanoma.,Nature medicine,Nat. Med.,2012-09-16,"The discovery of potent inhibitors of the BRAF proto-oncogene has revolutionized therapy for melanoma harboring mutations in BRAF, yet NRAS-mutant melanoma remains without an effective therapy. Because direct pharmacological inhibition of the RAS proto-oncogene has thus far been unsuccessful, we explored systems biology approaches to identify synergistic drug combination(s) that can mimic RAS inhibition. Here, leveraging an inducible mouse model of NRAS-mutant melanoma, we show that pharmacological inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) activates apoptosis but not cell-cycle arrest, which is in contrast to complete genetic neuroblastoma RAS homolog (NRAS) extinction, which triggers both of these effects. Network modeling pinpointed cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) as a key driver of this differential phenotype. Accordingly, combined pharmacological inhibition of MEK and CDK4 in vivo led to substantial synergy in therapeutic efficacy. We suggest a gradient model of oncogenic NRAS signaling in which the output is gated, resulting in the decoupling of discrete downstream biological phenotypes as a result of incomplete inhibition.

As a dose-escalation strategy, tandem transplants have been used, but are associated with persistent immunocompromise. This study evaluated the provision of an autologous costimulated, activated T-cell product to support immunologic function. Nineteen subjects with high-risk neuroblastoma were enrolled in a pilot phase and 23 subjects were entered in to the randomized study. Immunologic reconstitution was defined by flow cytometric and functional assays. Next-generation sequencing was conducted to identify changes to the T-cell repertoire. Twenty-two patients were vaccinated to define effects on antibody responses. Subjects who received their autologous costimulated T-cell product on day 2 had significantly superior T-cell counts and T-cell proliferation compared with those who received T cells on day 90.

To determine the genetic basis for neuroblastoma, we performed whole-genome sequencing (6 cases), exome sequencing (16 cases), genome-wide rearrangement analyses (32 cases) and targeted analyses of specific genomic loci (40 cases) using massively parallel sequencing. On average, each tumor had 19 somatic alterations in coding genes (range of 3-70). Among genes not previously known to be involved in neuroblastoma, chromosomal deletions and sequence alterations of the chromatin-remodeling genes ARID1A and ARID1B were identified in 8 of 71 tumors (11%) and were associated with early treatment failure and decreased survival.

"B7-H3, a potential therapeutic target, is expressed in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.",Journal of neuro-oncology,J. Neurooncol.,2012-12-12,"Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a brain cancer with a median survival of only 1 year. Lack of molecular characterization of this tumor impedes the development of novel therapies. Membrane protein B7-H3, aka CD276, involved in interactions with host defenses in certain cancers, has been shown to be over-expressed in the majority of malignant neuroectodermal tumors including adult high-grade glioma. Targeting B7-H3 with a monoclonal antibody has demonstrated safety and efficacy in the salvage treatment of stage IV childhood neuroblastoma, another neuroectodermal tumor. It thus stands to reason that B7-H3 might serve as a therapeutic target in DIPG. B7-H3 immunoreactivity was determined in DIPG and non-diffuse brainstem glioma specimens with immunohistochemistry. In addition, B7-H3 mRNA expression was evaluated with microarrays in another set of specimens. All of the nine (100 %) DIPG specimens were shown to be B7-H3 immunoreactive. In the non-diffuse brainstem glioma group, none of the eight WHO grade I specimens showed B7-H3 immunoreactivity and nine of the 24 WHO grade II specimens (37.5 %) showed B7-H3 immunoreactivity. The association between histological grade and B7-H3 immunoreactivity was statistically highly significant. B7-H3 mRNA expression was also significantly higher in DIPG samples than in normal brain and juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma (WHO grade I) specimens. In summary, B7-H3 is over-expressed in DIPG.

Phys.,2012-12-27,"This study was undertaken to assess historical trends in the use of radiation therapy (RT) for pediatric cancers over the past 4 decades. The National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database of the 9 original tumor registries (SEER-9) was queried to identify patients aged 0 to 19 years with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, bone and joint cancer, cancer of the brain and nervous system, Hodgkin lymphoma, neuroblastoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, soft tissue cancer, Wilms tumor, or retinoblastoma from 1973 to 2008. Patients were grouped into 4-year time epochs. The number and percentage of patients who received RT as part of their initial treatment were calculated per epoch by each diagnosis group from 1973 to 2008. RT use for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and retinoblastoma declined sharply from 57%, 57%, and 30% in 1973 to 1976 to 11%, 15%, and 2%, respectively, in 2005 to 2008. Similarly, smaller declines in RT use were also seen in brain cancer (70%-39%), bone cancer (41%-21%), Wilms tumor (75%-53%), and neuroblastoma (60%-25%). RT use curves for Wilms tumor and neuroblastoma were nonlinear with nadirs in 1993 to 1996 at 39% and 19%, respectively. There were minimal changes in RT use for Hodgkin lymphoma, soft tissue cancer, or acute myeloid leukemia, roughly stable at 72%, 40%, and 11%, respectively. Almost all patients treated with RT were given external beam RT exclusively. However, from 1985 to 2008, treatments involving brachytherapy, radioisotopes, or combination therapy increased in frequency, comprising 1.8%, 4.6%, and 11.9% of RT treatments in brain cancer, soft tissue cancer, and retinoblastoma, respectively.

The genetic landscape of high-risk neuroblastoma.,Nature genetics,Nat. Genet.,2013-01-20,"Neuroblastoma is a malignancy of the developing sympathetic nervous system that often presents with widespread metastatic disease, resulting in survival rates of less than 50%. To determine the spectrum of somatic mutation in high-risk neuroblastoma, we studied 240 affected individuals (cases) using a combination of whole-exome, genome and transcriptome sequencing as part of the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) initiative. Here we report a low median exonic mutation frequency of 0.60 per Mb (0.48 nonsilent) and notably few recurrently mutated genes in these tumors.

"Histone-lysine methyltransferase EHMT2 is involved in proliferation, apoptosis, cell invasion, and DNA methylation of human neuroblastoma cells.",Anti-cancer drugs,Anticancer Drugs,2013-06-01,"Neuroblastoma (NB), a childhood neoplasm arising from neural crest cells, is characterized by a diversity of clinical behaviors ranging from spontaneous remission to rapid tumor progression and death. In addition to genetic abnormalities, recent studies have indicated that epigenetic aberrations also contribute toward NB pathogenesis. However, the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of NB are largely unknown. Inhibition of euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2) was evaluated through the measurement of H3K9Me2 levels. Cell proliferation was examined by cell counting in human NB cell lines (LA1-55n, IMR-5, and NMB). The RNA expression of EHMT2, MYCN, and p21 was measured by real-time PCR. The expression of PCNA, MYCN, p53, cyclinD1, H3, H3K27M2, and H3K9Me2 was examined by western blot analysis. In-vitro invasion and the effects of the EHMT2 inhibitor (BIX-01294) were assessed in the Transwell chamber assay. Caspase 3 and 8 activities were measured using a Caspase-Glo assay kit. The level of overall DNA methylation was measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy. BIX-01294, a specific inhibitor of EHMT2 (a key enzyme for histone H3 dimethylation at lysine-9), specifically decreases the overall H3K9Me2 level but not H3K27Me2. The inhibition of EHMT2 decreased the proliferation of NB cells and induced apoptosis by increasing caspase 8/caspase 3 activity. BIX-01294 inhibited NB cell mobility and invasion. This was accompanied by a decreased expression of the MYCN oncogene. Inhibition of EHMT2 enhanced a doxorubicin-induced inhibitory effect on cell proliferation. Finally, EHMT2 inhibition modulated overall DNA methylation levels in NB cells. Our results show that histone-lysine methylation is involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell invasion, and overall DNA methylation in human NB cells. Further understanding of this mechanism may provide an insight into the pathogenesis of NB progression and lead to novel treatment strategies.",Journal Article,2425.0,25.0,NB a childhood neoplasm arising from neural crest cells is characterized by a diversity of clinical behaviors ranging from spontaneous remission to rapid tumor progression and death In addition to genetic abnormalities recent studies have indicated that epigenetic aberrations also contribute toward NB pathogenesis However the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of NB are largely unknown Inhibition of euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2 EHMT2 was evaluated through the measurement of H3K9Me2 levels Cell proliferation was examined by cell counting in human NB cell lines LA1-55n IMR-5 and NMB The RNA expression of EHMT2 MYCN and p21 was measured by real-time PCR The expression of PCNA MYCN p53 cyclinD1 H3 H3K27M2 and H3K9Me2 was examined by western blot analysis In-vitro invasion and the effects of the EHMT2 inhibitor BIX-01294 were assessed in the Transwell chamber assay Caspase 3 and 8 activities were measured using a Caspase-Glo assay kit The level of overall DNA methylation was measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy BIX-01294 a specific inhibitor of EHMT2 a key enzyme for histone H3 dimethylation at lysine-9 specifically decreases the overall H3K9Me2 level but not H3K27Me2 The inhibition of EHMT2 decreased the proliferation of NB cells and induced apoptosis by increasing caspase 8/caspase 3 activity BIX-01294 inhibited NB cell mobility and invasion This was accompanied by a decreased expression of the MYCN oncogene Inhibition of EHMT2 enhanced a doxorubicin-induced inhibitory effect on cell proliferation Finally EHMT2 inhibition modulated overall DNA methylation levels in NB cells Our results show that histone-lysine methylation is involved in cell proliferation apoptosis cell invasion and overall DNA methylation in human NB cells Further understanding of this mechanism may provide an insight into the pathogenesis of NB progression and lead to novel treatment strategies,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3446, 8, 864, 2131, 2635, 29, 3922, 10686, 37, 16, 765, 20, 8, 3653, 1, 38, 3704, 2223, 29, 3280, 734, 6, 1321, 30, 91, 2, 273, 4, 352, 6, 336, 1171, 435, 94, 47, 1103, 17, 1418, 2152, 120, 1248, 1317, 3446, 1384, 137, 3, 1418, 483, 1181, 3, 1384, 1, 3446, 32, 1733, 860, 297, 1, 62543, 1508, 6041, 78, 3747, 18, 25434, 10, 194, 298, 3, 2204, 1, 23704, 148, 31, 457, 10, 409, 20, 31, 9479, 4, 171, 3446, 31, 285, 17461, 23841, 32106, 33, 2, 28868, 3, 893, 55, 1, 25434, 4068, 2, 2657, 10, 644, 20, 1589, 98, 604, 3, 55, 1, 8220, 4068, 624, 15611, 3739, 62544, 2, 23704, 10, 409, 20, 1521, 2639, 65, 4, 439, 578, 2, 3, 176, 1, 3, 25434, 230, 40291, 40292, 11, 275, 4, 3, 9501, 11761, 719, 1469, 27, 2, 66, 2042, 11, 644, 75, 8, 1469, 35544, 719, 1164, 3, 301, 1, 63, 261, 569, 10, 644, 20, 3165, 5140, 782, 5326, 40291, 40292, 8, 112, 230, 1, 25434, 8, 825, 1644, 9, 1508, 3739, 25086, 28, 6041, 83, 1225, 2140, 3, 63, 23704, 301, 84, 44, 62545, 3, 297, 1, 25434, 340, 3, 457, 1, 3446, 37, 2, 277, 351, 20, 602, 1469, 66, 1469, 27, 128, 40291, 40292, 879, 3446, 31, 5717, 2, 578, 26, 10, 2756, 20, 8, 340, 55, 1, 3, 4068, 1836, 297, 1, 25434, 651, 8, 856, 277, 1810, 254, 23, 31, 457, 1368, 25434, 297, 1757, 63, 261, 569, 148, 4, 3446, 37, 114, 99, 514, 17, 1508, 6041, 569, 16, 646, 4, 31, 457, 351, 31, 578, 2, 63, 261, 569, 4, 171, 3446, 37, 195, 612, 1, 26, 670, 68, 377, 35, 2670, 237, 3, 1384, 1, 3446, 91, 2, 1122, 6, 229, 24, 422]",1942.0,23466651,129

Acute changes in blood pressure in patients with neuroblastoma treated with ¹³¹I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG).,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2013-04-23,"Iodine-131-metaiodobenzylguanidine ((131)I-MIBG) provides targeted radiotherapy for children with neuroblastoma. The aim of our study was to evaluate systematically the acute effects of (131)I-MIBG on blood pressure in patients with neuroblastoma and to identify possible predictors of hypertension. We conducted a retrospective chart review of neuroblastoma patients who were treated with (131)I-MIBG between January 1, 1999 and June 1, 2012 at the University of California, San Francisco. Clinical data for 172 patients with neuroblastoma, receiving 218 administrations of (131)I-MIBG, were collected. The primary endpoint was development of systolic blood pressure above the 95th percentile for age. Logistic regression with generalized estimating equations to account for multiple administrations in some subjects was used to identify bivariate and multivariate predictors of hypertension. Of the 218 administrations of (131)I-MIBG, 112 (51.3%) were associated with at least one episode of systolic hypertension during or after the (131)I-MIBG infusion. The majority of these acute elevations in blood pressure resolved within 48 hours of the infusion. Only six administrations in five patients required nifedipine administration to lower blood pressure.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in neuroblastoma patients receiving anti-GD2 3F8 monoclonal antibody.,Cancer,Cancer,2013-04-30,"Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) comprises clinical and radiologic findings with rapid onset and potentially dire consequences. Patients experience hypertension, seizures, headache, visual disturbance, and/or altered mentation. Magnetic resonance imaging reveals edematous changes in the brain (especially in the parietal and occipital lobes). In this report, the authors describe PRES associated with antidisialoganglioside (anti-GD2 ) monoclonal antibody (MoAb) immunotherapy, which is now standard for high-risk neuroblastoma but has not previously been implicated in PRES. Successive clinical trials using the anti-GD2 MoAb 3F8 (a murine immunoglobulin 3 MoAb specific for GD2) for patients with neuroblastoma involved multiple cycles of standard-dose 3F8 (SD-3F8) (20 mg/m2 daily for 5 days per cycle) or 2 cycles of high-dose 3F8 (HD-3F8) (80 mg/m2 daily for 5 days per cycle) followed by cycles of SD-3F8. PRES was diagnosed in 5 of 215 patients (2.3%), including 3 of 160 (1.9%) who received SD-3F8 and 2 of 55 (3.6%) who received HD-3F8 (P = .6). All 5 patients had a rapid return to clinical-radiologic baseline. PRES occurred in 3 of 26 patients (11.5%) whose prior treatment included external-beam radiotherapy to the brain (2 of 6 patients status-post total body irradiation and 1 of 20 patients status-post craniospinal irradiation) compared with 2 of 189 patients (1.1%) who had not received prior brain irradiation (P = .01). Hypertension, which is strongly linked to PRES, reached grade 3 toxicity in 12 of 215 patients (5.6%), including the 5 patients with PRES and 7 patients without PRES. Patients who receive anti-GD2 MoAb immunotherapy should be closely monitored for, and undergo urgent treatment or evaluation of, symptoms that may herald PRES (eg, hypertension or headaches).

In silico driven redesign of a clinically relevant antibody for the treatment of GD2 positive tumors.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2013-05-16,"Ganglioside GD2 is a cell surface glycolipid that is highly expressed on cancer cells of neuroectodermal origin, including neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, melanoma, sarcomas, brain tumors and small cell lung cancer. Monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) that target GD2 have shown clinical efficacy in the treatment of GD2 expressing tumors, and are expected to be the new standard of care for the treatment of pediatric neuroblastoma. In this study, the crystal structure of anti-GD2 murine MoAb 3F8 was solved to 1.65 Å resolution and used as a template for molecular docking simulations of its antigen, the penta-saccharide head group of GD2. Molecular docking revealed a binding motif composed of 12 key interacting amino acid side-chains, involving an extensive network of interactions involving main-chain and side-chain hydrogen bonding, two Pi-CH interactions, and an important charged interaction between Arg95 of the H3 loop with the penultimate sialic acid residue of GD2. Based on in silico scanning mutagenesis of the 12 interacting amino acids from the docked 3F8:GD2 model, a single point mutation (Heavy Chain: Gly54Ile) was engineered into a humanized 3F8 (hu3F8) MoAb and found to have a 6-9 fold enhancement in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity of neuroblastoma and melanoma cell lines.

Pancreatic involvement in neuroblastoma with radiologic-pathologic correlation: a single-institution experience.,AJR. American journal of roentgenology,AJR Am J Roentgenol,2013-07-01,"Pancreatic involvement in neuroblastoma is extremely rare, with few cases reported in the literature. We present imaging findings of pancreatic involvement in neuroblastoma with clinical and pathologic correlation in the largest documented series to date. We prospectively reported pancreatic involvement evident on multimodality imaging in neuroblastoma patients presenting to our institution from 1997 to 2011. Lesions were classified according to location within the pancreas, and imaging features were correlated with cytogenetic and surgicopathologic findings. Neuroblastoma involving the pancreas was evident on imaging of seven of 1031 patients (mean age, 6.6 years). One patient had pancreatic involvement at presentation, and six developed pancreatic disease at relapse or disease progression. Pancreatic lesions were most frequently initially identified on concurrent CT and (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy, and additional lesions initially were found on MRI and ultrasound. Five of seven patients had focal lesions, one had diffuse pancreatic involvement, and one had pancreatic extension from contiguous disease. The distribution of lesions favored the pancreatic body and tail. All patients had International Neuroblastoma Staging System stage 3 or 4 disease, Children's Oncology Group intermediate- or high-risk disease, and unfavorable histology at initial diagnosis.

Radiation exposure to family caregivers and nurses of pediatric neuroblastoma patients receiving 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) therapy.,Clinical nuclear medicine,Clin Nucl Med,2013-08-01,"(131)I-MIBG provides molecularly targeted radiotherapy for pediatric neuroblastoma patients with relapsed or refractory disease. At our institution, designated family caregivers and nurses participate in the care of the child during hospital isolation for approximately 3-5 days post-administration. The purpose of this study was to measure radiation exposure to family caregivers and nurses caring for children with neuroblastoma during their stay in the hospital for (131)I-MIBG therapy. Iodine-(131)I-MIBG therapy was administered to 14 children (mean age 6.7 ± 3.8 years, range 3-13 years) for relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma from 2009 to 2010. The administered activity ranged from 5.92 to 23.31 GBq (mean 13.65 ± 5.22 GBq). The mean administered activities were 8.77 ± 2.07 GBq (range 5.92-11.1 GBq) and 17.32 ± 3.4 GBq (range 11.84-23.31 GBq) for children less than 7 and 7 years or older, respectively. One or two designated caregivers received specific radiation safety training prior to treatment. One caregiver was allowed to stay in a room adjacent to the child to provide general patient care as instructed by nursing. Nurses assigned to the care of the patient also received specific radiation instructions. The total caregiver and nursing whole body radiation dose was determined using real-time personal dosimetry. There was no correlation between caregiver (r = -0.068, P = 0.817) or nursing (r = -0.031, P = 0.916) whole-body radiation dose and the patient-administered activity. The overall mean caregiver radiation dose was 1.79 ± 1.04 mSv, but the range of caregiver radiation doses varied by more than an order of magnitude (0.35-3.81 mSv), with no caregiver receiving more than 4.0 mSv. The overall mean nursing radiation dose was 0.44 ± 0.27 mSv per treatment, ranging from 0.15 to 1.08 mSv, with no nurse receiving more than 1.1 mSv. When grouped by patient age, there was no significant difference (P = 0.673) in the mean caregiver exposure for children less than 7 years, 1.94 ± 1.17 mSv (n = 6, range 0.7-3.81 mSv), compared to 1.69 ± 0.99 mSv (n = 8, range 0.35-3.37 mSv) for children 7 years or older. Similarly, there was no significant difference (P = 0.511) in mean nursing exposure for children less than 7 years, 0.5 ± 0.31 mSv (n = 6, range 0.18-1.08 mSv), compared to 0.4 ± 0.24 mSv (n = 8, range 0.15-0.94 mSv) for children 7 years or older. There was no significant correlation between caregiver or nursing radiation exposure and patient-administered activity or no significant difference between patient age. This may suggest that older children who tend to receive higher administered activities may require less direct caregiver support during their hospital stay.

The CpG island methylator phenotype: what's in a name?,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2013-06-25,"Although the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) was first identified and has been most extensively studied in colorectal cancer, the term ""CIMP"" has been repeatedly used over the past decade to describe CpG island promoter methylation in other tumor types, including bladder, breast, endometrial, gastric, glioblastoma (gliomas), hepatocellular, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, renal cell, and prostate cancers, as well as for leukemia, melanoma, duodenal adenocarninomas, adrenocortical carcinomas, and neuroblastomas. CIMP has been reported to be useful for predicting prognosis and response to treatment in a variety of tumor types, but it remains unclear whether or not CIMP is a universal phenomenon across human neoplasia or if there should be cancer-specific definitions of the phenotype. Recently, it was shown that somatic isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutations, frequently observed in gliomas, establish CIMP in primary human astrocytes by remodeling the methylome. Interestingly, somatic IDH1 and IDH2 mutations, and loss-of-function mutations in ten-eleven translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenase-2 (TET2) associated with a hypermethylation phenotype, are also found in multiple enchondromas of patients with Ollier disease and Mafucci syndrome, and leukemia, respectively. These data provide the first clues for the elucidation of a molecular basis for CIMP. Although CIMP appears as a phenomenon that occurs in various cancer types, the definition is poorly defined and differs for each tumor.

Purged versus non-purged peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation for high-risk neuroblastoma (COG A3973): a randomised phase 3 trial.,The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2013-07-25,"Myeloablative chemoradiotherapy and immunomagnetically purged autologous bone marrow transplantation has been shown to improve outcome for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. Currently, peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are infused after myeloablative therapy, but the effect of purging is unknown. We did a randomised study of tumour-selective PBSC purging in stem-cell transplantation for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. Between March 16, 2001, and Feb 24, 2006, children and young adults (<30 years) with high-risk neuroblastoma were randomly assigned at diagnosis by a web-based system (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive either non-purged or immunomagnetically purged PBSC. Randomisation was done in blocks stratified by International Neuroblastoma Staging System stage, age, MYCN status, and International Neuroblastoma Pathology classification. Patients and treating physicians were not masked to treatment assignment. All patients were treated with six cycles of induction chemotherapy, myeloablative consolidation, and radiation therapy to the primary tumour site plus meta-iodobenzylguanidine avid metastases present before myeloablative therapy, followed by oral isotretinoin. PBSC collection was done after two induction cycles. For purging, PBSC were mixed with carbonyl iron and phagocytic cells removed with samarium cobalt magnets. Remaining cells were mixed with immunomagnetic beads prepared with five monoclonal antibodies targeting neuroblastoma cell surface antigens and attached cells were removed using samarium cobalt magnets. Patients underwent autologous stem-cell transplantation with PBSC as randomly assigned after six cycles of induction therapy. The primary endpoint was event-free survival and was analysed by intention-to-treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00004188. 495 patients were enrolled, of whom 486 were randomly assigned to treatment: 243 patients to receive non-purged PBSC and 243 to received purged PBSC. PBSC were collected from 229 patients from the purged group and 236 patients from the non-purged group, and 180 patients from the purged group and 192 from the non-purged group received transplant. 5-year event-free survival was 40% (95% CI 33-46) in the purged group versus 36% (30-42) in the non-purged group (p=0·77); 5-year overall survival was 50% (95% CI 43-56) in the purged group compared with 51% (44-57) in the non-purged group (p=0·81). Toxic deaths occurred in 15 patients during induction (eight in the purged group and seven in the non-purged group) and 12 during consolidation (eight in the purged group and four in the non-purged group). The most common adverse event reported was grade 3 or worse stomatitis during both induction (87 of 242 patients in the purged group and 93 of 243 patients in the non-purged group) and consolidation (131 of 177 in the purged group vs 145 of 191 in the non-purged group). Serious adverse events during induction were grade 3 or higher decreased cardiac function (four of 242 in the purged group and five of 243 in the non-purged group) and elevated creatinine (five of 242 in the purged group and six of 243 non-purged group) and during consolidation were sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (12 of 177 in the purged group and 17 of 191 in the non-purged group), acute vascular leak (11 of 177 in the purged group and nine of 191 in the non-purged group), and decreased cardiac function (one of 177 in the purged group and four of 191 in the non-purged group). Immunomagnetic purging of PBSC for autologous stem-cell transplantation did not improve outcome, perhaps because of incomplete purging or residual tumour in patients. Non-purged PBSC are acceptable for support of myeloablative therapy of high-risk neuroblastoma.","Clinical Trial, Phase III",2371.0,138.0,Myeloablative chemoradiotherapy and immunomagnetically purged

Autologous Transplantation-novel agents and immunomodulatory strategies.",Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2013-09-07,"In the National Cancer Institute's Second International Workshop on the Biology, Prevention, and Treatment of Relapse after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, the Scientific/Educational Session on Autologous Transplantation addressed the role of novel agents and immunomodulatory strategies in management of relapse after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT). Concepts were illustrated through in-depth discussion of multiple myeloma, with broader discussion of areas relevant for relapse of other malignancies as well as in the setting of allogeneic transplantation. Dr. Hari provided an overview of the epidemiology of relapse after AHSCT in multiple myeloma, addressing clinical patterns, management implications, and treatment options at relapse, highlighting the implications of novel therapeutic agents in initial, maintenance, and relapse treatment. Dr. Avigan discussed current concepts in tumor vaccine design, including whole cell and antigen-specific strategies, use of an AHSCT platform to reverse tumor-associated immunosuppression and tolerance, and combining vaccines with immunomodulatory agents to promote establishment of durable antitumor immunity. Dr. Hsu reviewed the immunogenetics of natural killer (NK) cells and general NK biology, the clinical importance of autologous NK activity (eg, lymphoma and neuroblastoma), the impact of existing therapies on promotion of NK cell activity (eg, immunomodulatory drugs, monoclonal antibodies), and strategies for enhancing autologous and allogeneic NK cell effects through NK cell gene profiling.

"Recurrent pre-existing and acquired DNA copy number alterations, including focal TERT gains, in neuroblastoma central nervous system metastases.","Genes, chromosomes & cancer",Genes Chromosomes Cancer,2013-10-10,"Stage 4 neuroblastomas have a high rate of local and metastatic relapse and associated disease mortality. The central nervous system (CNS) is currently one of the most common isolated relapse sites, yet the genomic alterations that contribute to these metastases are unknown. This study sought to identify recurrent DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) and target genes relating to neuroblastoma CNS metastases by studying 19 pre-CNS primary tumors and 27 CNS metastases, including 12 matched pairs. SNP microarray analyses revealed that MYCN amplified (MYCNA) tumors had recurrent CNAs different from non-MYCNA cohorts. Several CNAs known to be prevalent among primary neuroblastomas occurred more frequently in CNS metastases, including 4p-, 7q+, 12q+, and 19q- in non-MYCNA metastases, and 9p- and 14q- irrespective of MYCNA status. In addition, novel CNS metastases-related CNAs included 18q22.1 gains in non-MYCNA pre-CNS primaries and 5p15.33 gains and 15q26.1→tel losses in non-MYCNA CNS metastases. Based on minimal common regions, gene expression, and biological properties, TERT (5p), NR2F2 (15q), ALDH1A3 (15q), CDKN2A (9p), and possibly CDH7 and CDH19 (18q) were candidate genes associated with the CNS metastatic process.

Engineering anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies for cancer immunotherapy.,FEBS letters,FEBS Lett.,2013-12-01,"Ganglioside GD2 is highly expressed on neuroectoderm-derived tumors and sarcomas, including neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, melanoma, small cell lung cancer, brain tumors, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma in children and adolescents, as well as liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma and other soft tissue sarcomas in adults. Since GD2 expression in normal tissues is restricted to the brain, which is inaccessible to circulating antibodies, and in selected peripheral nerves and melanocytes, it was deemed a suitable target for systemic tumor immunotherapy. Anti-GD2 antibodies have been actively tested in clinical trials for neuroblastoma for over the past two decades, with proven safety and efficacy. The main limitations have been acute pain toxicity associated with GD2 expression on peripheral nerve fibers and the inability of antibodies to treat bulky tumor. Several strategies have been developed to reduce pain toxicity, including bypassing complement activation, using blocking antibodies, or targeting of O-acetyl-GD2 derivative that is not expressed on peripheral nerves. To enhance anti-tumor efficacy, anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies and fragments have been engineered into immunocytokines, immunotoxins, antibody drug conjugates, radiolabeled antibodies, targeted nanoparticles, T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptors. The challenges of these approaches will be reviewed to build a perspective for next generation anti-GD2 therapeutics in cancer therapy.

Time to disease progression in children with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma treated with ABT-751: a report from the Children's Oncology Group (ANBL0621).,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2013-12-18,"ABT-751, an orally bioavailable sulfonamide binds the colchicine site of beta-tubulin and inhibits microtubule polymerization. Prior phase I studies established the recommended dose in children with solid tumors as 200 mg/m(2) PO daily × 7 days every 21 days and subjects with neuroblastoma experienced prolonged stable disease. We conducted a phase 2 study (NCT00436852) in children and adolescents with progressive neuroblastoma to determine if ABT-751 prolonged the time to progression (TTP) compared to a hypothesized standard based on a historical control population. Children and adolescents (n = 91) with a median (range) age 7.7 (2.3-21.5) years and progressive neuroblastoma were enrolled and stratified by disease status into disease measureable by CT/MRI (n = 47) or disease assessable by (123) I-metaiodobenzylguanine scintigraphy (MIBG, n = 44). Response was evaluated using RECIST for measureable disease and the Curie score for MIBG-avid disease. ABT-751 was well tolerated. The objective response rate was 7%. The median TTP was 42 days (95% CI: 36, 56) in the measureable disease stratum and 45 days (95% CI: 42, 85) in the MIBG-avid disease stratum. TTP was similar to the historical control group (n = 136, median TTP 42 days). For the combined strata (n = 91), 1-year progression free survival (PFS) was 13 ± 4% and overall survival (OS) was 48 ± 5%. The low objective response rate and failure to prolong TTP indicate that ABT-751 is not sufficiently active to warrant further development for neuroblastoma. However, this trial demonstrates the utility of TTP as the primary endpoint in phase 2 trials in children and adolescents with neuroblastoma.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",2225.0,12.0,ABT-751 an orally bioavailable sulfonamide binds the colchicine site of beta-tubulin and inhibits microtubule polymerization Prior phase I studies established the recommended dose in children with solid tumors as 200 mg/m 2 PO daily 7 days every 21 days and subjects with experienced prolonged stable disease We conducted a phase 2 study NCT00436852 in children and adolescents with progressive to determine if ABT-751 prolonged the time to progression TTP compared to a hypothesized standard based on a historical control population Children and adolescents n 91 with a median range age 7.7 2.3-21.5 years and progressive were enrolled and stratified by disease status into disease measureable by CT/MRI n 47 or disease assessable by 123 I-metaiodobenzylguanine scintigraphy MIBG n 44 Response was evaluated using RECIST for measureable disease and the Curie score for MIBG-avid disease ABT-751 was well tolerated The objective response rate was 7 The median TTP was 42 days 95 CI 36 56 in the measureable disease stratum and 45 days 95 CI 42 85 in the MIBG-avid disease stratum TTP was similar to the historical control group n 136 median TTP 42 days For the combined strata n 91 1-year progression free survival PFS was 13 ± 4 and overall survival OS was 48 ± 5 The low objective response rate and failure to prolong TTP indicate that ABT-751 is not sufficiently active to warrant further development for However this trial demonstrates the utility of TTP as the primary endpoint in phase 2 trials in children and adolescents with,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3095, 6351, 35, 1428, 6582, 24736, 3333, 3, 20416, 606, 1, 1090, 5303, 2, 1576, 4621, 12273, 324, 124, 70, 94, 635, 3, 793, 61, 4, 541, 5, 537, 57, 22, 1250, 81, 188, 18, 4826, 391, 67, 162, 454, 239, 162, 2, 976, 5, 592, 1069, 585, 34, 21, 426, 8, 124, 18, 45, 63748, 4, 541, 2, 3101, 5, 1014, 6, 223, 492, 3095, 6351, 1069, 3, 98, 6, 91, 2422, 72, 6, 8, 1237, 260, 90, 23, 8, 2252, 182, 266, 541, 2, 3101, 78, 970, 5, 8, 52, 184, 89, 67, 67, 18, 27, 239, 33, 60, 2, 1014, 11, 346, 2, 1173, 20, 34, 156, 237, 34, 19282, 20, 425, 704, 78, 662, 15, 34, 3120, 20, 2698, 70, 63749, 7577, 3574, 78, 584, 51, 10, 194, 75, 1834, 9, 19282, 34, 2, 3, 21260, 368, 9, 3574, 5189, 34, 3095, 6351, 10, 149, 421, 3, 461, 51, 116, 10, 67, 3, 52, 2422, 10, 595, 162, 48, 58, 511, 664, 4, 3, 19282, 34, 4897, 2, 512, 162, 48, 58, 595, 772, 4, 3, 3574, 5189, 34, 4897, 2422, 10, 288, 6, 3, 2252, 182, 87, 78, 4829, 52, 2422, 595, 162, 9, 3, 397, 5758, 78, 970, 14, 111, 91, 115, 25, 300, 10, 233, 810, 39, 2, 63, 25, 118, 10, 576, 810, 33, 3, 154, 461, 51, 116, 2, 496, 6, 3615, 2422, 1008, 17, 3095, 6351, 16, 44, 5938, 544, 6, 2946, 195, 193, 9, 137, 26, 160, 1902, 3, 1207, 1, 2422, 22, 3, 86, 1138, 4, 124, 18, 143, 4, 541, 2, 3101, 5]",1533.0,24347462,211
"Ototoxicity in children with high-risk neuroblastoma: prevalence, risk factors, and concordance of grading scales--a report from the Children's Oncology Group.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2014-01-13,"Platinum-based therapy is the mainstay for management of high-risk neuroblastoma. Prevalence of platinum-related ototoxicity has ranged from 13% to 95% in previous reports; variability is attributable to small samples and disparate grading scales. There is no consensus regarding optimal ototoxicity grading. Furthermore, prevalence and predictors of hearing loss in a large uniformly treated high-risk neuroblastoma population are unknown. We address these gaps in our study. Audiologic testing was completed after administration of cisplatin alone (< 400 mg/m(2); exposure one) or after cisplatin (400 mg/m(2)) plus carboplatin (1,700 mg/m(2); exposure two). Hearing loss was graded using four scales (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association; Brock; Chang; and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3 [CTCAEv3]). Of 489 eligible patients, 333 had evaluable audiologic data. Median age at diagnosis was 3.3 years. Prevalence of severe hearing loss differed by scale. For those in the exposure-one group, prevalence ranged from 8% per Brock to 47% per CTCAEv3 (Brock v CTCAEv3 and Chang, P < .01; CTCAEv3 v Chang, P = .16); for those in the exposure-two group, prevalence ranged from 30% per Brock to 71% per CTCAEv3 (all pair-wise comparisons, P < .01). In patients requiring hearing aids, hearing loss was graded as severe in 49% (Brock), 91% (Chang), and 100% (CTCAEv3).

Diverse solid tumors expressing a restricted epitope of L1-CAM can be targeted by chimeric antigen receptor redirected T lymphocytes.,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",J. Immunother.,,"Adhesion molecule L1-CAM (CD171) was originally reported to be overexpressed on neuroblastoma and to play an important role during tumor progression. More recently, it has been shown to be overexpressed on many other solid tumors such as melanoma and carcinomas of the cervix, ovary, bladder, and others. Thus, there has been a growing interest in using this cell-surface molecule as a target for both antibody-based and cellular-based therapy-our group has previously examined the clinical utility of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-redirected cytolytic T cells that specifically target the CE7 epitope of L1-CAM on neuroblastoma patients. Here, we sought to determine whether this CE7 epitope is present on other recently identified L1-CAM tumors and whether it too can be targeted by CAR T cells. Our studies demonstrate that a diverse array of human tumor cell lines and primary solid tumors (ovarian, lung, and renal carcinoma, glioblastoma and neuroblastoma) do express the CE7 epitope and can efficiently stimulate CE7-specific CAR-redirected (CE7R) T-cell lytic activity and secretion of proinflamatory cytokines. L1-CAM was also detected on a limited number of normal tissues; however, L1-CAM expressed on normal human monocytes was not bound by the CE7 mAb nor was it targeted by CE7R T cells, suggesting that the CE7 epitope is more tumor restricted and not expressed on all L1-CAM tissues. Overall, the CE7 epitope of L1-CAM on a variety of tumors may be amenable to targeting by CE7R T cells, making it a promising target for adoptive immunotherapy.

Imaging the norepinephrine transporter in neuroblastoma: a comparison of [18F]-MFBG and 123I-MIBG.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2014-02-26,"The norepinephrine transporter (NET) is a critical regulator of catecholamine uptake in normal physiology and is expressed in neuroendocrine tumors like neuroblastoma. Although the norepinephrine analog, meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), is an established substrate for NET, (123)I/(131)I-MIBG has several clinical limitations for diagnostic imaging. In the current studies, we evaluated meta-[(18)F]-fluorobenzylguanidine ([(18)F]-MFBG) and compared it with (123)I-MIBG for imaging NET-expressing neuroblastomas. NET expression levels in neuroblastoma cell lines were determined by Western blot and (123)I-MIBG uptake assays. Five neuroblastoma cell lines and two xenografts (SK-N-BE(2)C and LAN1) expressing different levels of NET were used for comparative in vitro and in vivo uptake studies. The uptake of [(18)F]-MFBG in cells was specific and proportional to the expression level of NET. Although [(18)F]-MFBG had a 3-fold lower affinity for NET and an approximately 2-fold lower cell uptake in vitro compared with that of (123)I-MIBG, the in vivo imaging and tissue radioactivity concentration measurements demonstrated higher [(18)F]-MFBG xenograft uptake and tumor-to-normal organ ratios at 1 and 4 hours after injection. A comparison of 4 hours [(18)F]-MFBG PET (positron emission tomography) imaging with 24 hours (123)I-MIBG SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) imaging showed an approximately 3-fold higher tumor uptake of [(18)F]-MFBG, but slightly lower tumor-to-background ratios in mice. [(18)F]-MFBG is a promising radiopharmaceutical for specifically imaging NET-expressing neuroblastomas, with fast pharmacokinetics and whole-body clearance. [(18)F]-MFBG PET imaging shows higher sensitivity, better detection of small lesions with low NET expression, allows same day scintigraphy with a shorter image acquisition time, and has the potential for lower patient radiation exposure compared with (131)I/(123)I-MIBG.",Comparative Study,2155.0,24.0,The norepinephrine transporter NET is a critical regulator of catecholamine uptake in normal physiology and is expressed in neuroendocrine tumors like Although the norepinephrine analog meta-iodobenzylguanidine MIBG is an established substrate for NET 123 I/ 131 I-MIBG has several clinical limitations for diagnostic imaging In the current studies we evaluated meta- 18 F -fluorobenzylguanidine 18 F -MFBG and compared it with 123 I-MIBG for imaging NET-expressing neuroblastomas NET expression levels in cell lines were determined by Western blot and 123 I-MIBG uptake assays Five cell lines and two xenografts SK-N-BE 2 C and LAN1 expressing different levels of NET were used for comparative in vitro and in vivo uptake studies The uptake of 18 F -MFBG in cells was specific and proportional to the expression level of NET Although 18 F -MFBG had a 3-fold lower affinity for NET and an approximately 2-fold lower cell uptake in vitro compared with that of 123 I-MIBG the in vivo imaging and tissue radioactivity concentration measurements demonstrated higher 18 F -MFBG xenograft uptake and tumor-to-normal organ ratios at 1 and 4 hours after injection A comparison of 4 hours 18 F -MFBG PET positron emission tomography imaging with 24 hours 123 I-MIBG SPECT single-photon emission computed tomography imaging showed an approximately 3-fold higher tumor uptake of 18 F -MFBG but slightly lower tumor-to-background ratios in mice 18 F -MFBG is a promising radiopharmaceutical for specifically imaging NET-expressing neuroblastomas with fast pharmacokinetics and whole-body clearance 18 F -MFBG PET imaging shows higher sensitivity better detection of small lesions with low NET expression allows same day scintigraphy with a shorter image acquisition time and has the potential for lower patient radiation exposure compared with 131 I/ 123 I-MIBG,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 11675, 5246, 2587, 16, 8, 740, 2452, 1, 13549, 1135, 4, 295, 7206, 2, 16, 570, 4, 1542, 57, 733, 242, 3, 11675, 3497, 1742, 22557, 3574, 16, 35, 635, 4235, 9, 2587, 2698, 70, 2229, 70, 3574, 71, 392, 38, 1939, 9, 752, 270, 4, 3, 291, 94, 21, 194, 1742, 203, 1068, 48220, 203, 1068, 18076, 2, 72, 192, 5, 2698, 70, 3574, 9, 270, 2587, 1046, 8915, 2587, 55, 148, 4, 31, 285, 11, 509, 20, 1521, 2639, 2, 2698, 70, 3574, 1135, 1013, 365, 31, 285, 2, 100, 1348, 9845, 78, 40, 18, 256, 2, 46737, 1046, 338, 148, 1, 2587, 11, 95, 9, 2352, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 1135, 94, 3, 1135, 1, 203, 1068, 18076, 4, 37, 10, 112, 2, 831, 6, 3, 55, 301, 1, 2587, 242, 203, 1068, 18076, 42, 8, 27, 1116, 280, 3601, 9, 2587, 2, 35, 705, 18, 1116, 280, 31, 1135, 4, 439, 72, 5, 17, 1, 2698, 70, 3574, 3, 4, 386, 270, 2, 246, 9076, 1227, 1685, 264, 142, 203, 1068, 18076, 1330, 1135, 2, 30, 6, 295, 1259, 1137, 28, 14, 2, 39, 1459, 50, 1754, 8, 1155, 1, 39, 1459, 203, 1068, 18076, 495, 1900, 1799, 872, 270, 5, 259, 1459, 2698, 70, 3574, 5817, 226, 4216, 1799, 1220, 872, 270, 224, 35, 705, 27, 1116, 142, 30, 1135, 1, 203, 1068, 18076, 84, 3223, 280, 30, 6, 2426, 1137, 4, 399, 203, 1068, 18076, 16, 8, 721, 10522, 9, 1225, 270, 2587, 1046, 8915, 5, 5830, 1159, 2, 902, 642, 1960, 203, 1068, 18076, 495, 270, 1949, 142, 485, 380, 638, 1, 302, 406, 5, 154, 2587, 55, 2333, 827, 218, 7577, 5, 8, 985, 1482, 3405, 98, 2, 71, 3, 174, 9, 280, 69, 121, 645, 72, 5, 2229, 70, 2698, 70, 3574]",1849.0,24573553,88
Subsequent malignant neoplasms in pediatric patients initially diagnosed with neuroblastoma.,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol.,2015-01-01,"Most prior studies evaluating subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs) in patients with neuroblastoma are restricted to long-term survivors and/or their treatment exposures. This study investigates SMNs in patients diagnosed with neuroblastoma at our institution. Records of 646 patients treated for neuroblastoma at St Jude Children's Research Hospital between 1961 and 2005 were reviewed. Data from patients with SMNs were analyzed and the 20- and 30-year cumulative incidence of SMNs and standardized incidence ratio were calculated. Twenty-one patients had a SMN. The 20- and 30-year cumulative incidences of a SMN were 2.6%±0.7% and 4.6%±1.1%, respectively. The standardized incidence ratio was 8.3 (95% confidence interval, 5.0-13.0). Five patients developed a SMN within 5 years from diagnosis. The median latency for the development of acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (n=4), sarcomas (n=7), and carcinomas (n=5) were 3.6, 9, and 24.2 years, respectively. Nine patients died from their SMN, including all with acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome. Patients with neuroblastoma have an increased risk of secondary neoplasia.

Secondary malignant neoplasms after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue for high-risk neuroblastoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2014-03-14,"Outcomes for high-risk neuroblastoma remain poor. Modern treatment protocols utilizing intense induction followed by myeloablative consolidation chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue (ASCR) have improved survival rates, but the long-term sequelae, including development of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMN), are just now surfacing. We retrospectively reviewed data from 87 patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who were treated with intensive induction chemotherapy followed by ASCR between January 1991 and July 2011 following one of two institutional protocols: Chicago Pilot 1 (CP1; n = 12) and Chicago Pilot 2 (CP2; n = 75). The 15-year overall survival rate for all 87 patients was 33.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23.1-45.0%). The 10- and 15-year cumulative incidence of SMN was 16.5% (95%CI, 7.2-38.0%) and 34.2% (95%CI, 18.6-63.1%), respectively, without evidence of a plateau at 15 years. Six of the 10 patients (n = 2 in CP1 and n = 8 in CP2) who developed SMN had hematologic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Solid tumors included thyroid papillary carcinoma, chondrosarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and biliary adenocarcinoma. A significantly higher incidence of SMN, especially hematological malignancies, was observed in this cohort compared to older neuroblastoma studies, potentially due to exposure to epipodophyllotoxins and a high cumulative dose of alkylating agents these patients received. The risk of developing an SMN continued to increase with survival time and did not reach the plateau at 15 years. Although the number of the patients is relatively small, our study emphasizes the need for life-long follow-up of survivors who were treated using modern therapy.",Clinical Trial,2139.0,15.0,Outcomes for high-risk remain poor Modern treatment protocols utilizing intense induction followed by myeloablative consolidation chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue ASCR have improved survival rates but the long-term sequelae including development of secondary malignant neoplasms SMN are just now surfacing We retrospectively reviewed data from 87 patients with high-risk who were treated with intensive induction chemotherapy followed by ASCR between January 1991 and July 2011 following one of two institutional protocols Chicago Pilot 1 CP1 n 12 and Chicago Pilot 2 CP2 n 75 The 15-year overall survival rate for all 87 patients was 33.9 95 confidence interval CI 23.1-45.0 The 10- and 15-year cumulative incidence of SMN was 16.5 95 CI 7.2-38.0 and 34.2 95 CI 18.6-63.1 respectively without evidence of a plateau at 15 years Six of the 10 patients n 2 in CP1 and n 8 in CP2 who developed SMN had hematologic malignancies including acute myeloid AML /myelodysplastic syndrome MDS Solid tumors included papillary carcinoma chondrosarcoma carcinoma and biliary adenocarcinoma A significantly higher incidence of SMN especially hematological malignancies was observed in this cohort compared to older studies potentially due to exposure to epipodophyllotoxins and a high cumulative dose of alkylating agents these patients received The risk of developing an SMN continued to increase with survival time and did not reach the plateau at 15 years Although the number of the patients is relatively small our study emphasizes the need for life-long follow-up of survivors who were treated using modern therapy,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[123, 9, 64, 43, 918, 334, 2366, 24, 2189, 2600, 3933, 504, 370, 20, 3246, 2173, 56, 5, 1028, 452, 31, 4256, 10729, 47, 231, 25, 151, 84, 3, 319, 337, 4156, 141, 193, 1, 568, 393, 1179, 6474, 32, 4673, 1134, 64078, 21, 894, 446, 74, 29, 912, 7, 5, 64, 43, 54, 11, 73, 5, 1686, 504, 56, 370, 20, 10729, 59, 1024, 3372, 2, 2066, 1132, 366, 104, 1, 100, 1115, 2189, 9344, 2281, 14, 22525, 78, 133, 2, 9344, 2281, 18, 48258, 78, 481, 3, 167, 111, 63, 25, 116, 9, 62, 912, 7, 10, 466, 83, 48, 307, 268, 58, 382, 14, 512, 13, 3, 79, 2, 167, 111, 967, 287, 1, 6474, 10, 245, 33, 48, 58, 67, 18, 519, 13, 2, 562, 18, 48, 58, 203, 49, 676, 14, 106, 187, 241, 1, 8, 6133, 28, 167, 60, 437, 1, 3, 79, 7, 78, 18, 4, 22525, 2, 78, 66, 4, 48258, 54, 276, 6474, 42, 813, 441, 141, 286, 533, 329, 10589, 681, 1223, 537, 57, 159, 1796, 134, 6116, 134, 2, 2532, 449, 8, 97, 142, 287, 1, 6474, 1093, 2890, 441, 10, 164, 4, 26, 180, 72, 6, 434, 94, 751, 520, 6, 645, 6, 25999, 2, 8, 64, 967, 61, 1, 3410, 183, 46, 7, 103, 3, 43, 1, 931, 35, 6474, 1351, 6, 344, 5, 25, 98, 2, 205, 44, 3690, 3, 6133, 28, 167, 60, 242, 3, 207, 1, 3, 7, 16, 1352, 302, 114, 45, 7519, 3, 594, 9, 358, 319, 166, 126, 1, 332, 54, 11, 73, 75, 2366, 36]",1617.0,24634399,325
Key role for myeloid cells: phase II results of anti-G(D2) antibody 3F8 plus granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor for chemoresistant osteomedullary neuroblastoma.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2014-04-03,"Anti-G(D2) murine antibody 3F8 plus subcutaneously (sc) administered granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was used against primary refractory neuroblastoma in metastatic osteomedullary sites. Large study size and long follow-up allowed assessment of prognostic factors in a multivariate analysis not reported with other anti-G(D2) antibodies. In a phase II trial, 79 patients without prior progressive disease were treated for persistent osteomedullary neuroblastoma documented by histology and/or metaiodobenzyl-guanidine (MIBG) scan. In the absence of human antimouse antibody, 3F8 + scGM-CSF cycles were repeated up to 24 months. Minimal residual disease (MRD) in bone marrow was measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction pre-enrollment and post-cycle #2, before initiation of 13-cis-retinoic acid. Study endpoints were: (i) progression-free survival (PFS) compared with the predecessor trial of 3F8 plus intravenously administered (iv) GM-CSF (26 patients) and (ii) impact of MRD on PFS. Using all 105 patients from the two consecutive 3F8 + GM-CSF trials, prognostic factors were analyzed by multivariate Cox regression model. Complete response rates to 3F8 + scGM-CSF were 87% by histology and 38% by MIBG. Five-year PFS was 24 ± 6%, which was significantly superior to 11 ± 7% with 3F8 + ivGM-CSF (p = 0.002). In the multivariate analysis, significantly better PFS was associated with R/R or H/R FCGR2A polymorphism, sc route of GM-CSF and early MRD response. MYCN amplification was not prognostic. Complement consumption was similar with either route of GM-CSF.

Striking dichotomy in outcome of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma in the contemporary era.,Cancer,Cancer,2014-04-01,"The authors exploited a large database to investigate the outcomes of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma in the contemporary era. All patients with high-risk neuroblastoma aged <12 years who were treated during induction at the authors' institution from 2000 through 2011 were studied, including 118 patients with MYCN-amplified [MYCN(+)] disease and 127 patients aged >18 months with MYCN-nonamplified [MYCN(-)] stage 4 disease. A complete response/very good partial response (CR/VGPR) to induction was correlated with significantly superior event-free survival (EFS) (P < .001) and overall survival (OS) (P < .001) compared with a partial response or less. Patients with MYCN(+) and MYCN(-) disease had similar rates of CR/VGPR to induction (P = .366), and those with MYCN(+) and MYCN(-) disease who attained a CR/VGPR had similar EFS (P = .346) and OS (P = .542). In contrast, only MYCN(+) patients had progressive disease as a response to induction (P < .001), and early death from progressive disease (<366 days after diagnosis) was significantly more common (P < .001) among those with MYCN(+) disease. Overall, among patients who had a partial response or less, MYCN(+) patients had significantly inferior EFS (P < .001) and OS (P < .001) compared with MYCN(-) patients, which accounted for the significantly worse EFS (P = .008) and OS (P = .002) for the entire MYCN(+) cohort versus the MYCN(-) cohort. Patients with MYCN(-), high-risk neuroblastoma display a broad, continuous spectrum with regard to response and outcome, whereas MYCN(+) patients either have an excellent response to induction associated with good long-term outcome or develop early progressive disease with a poor outcome. This extreme dichotomy in the clinical course of MYCN(+) patients points to underlying biologic differences with MYCN(+) neuroblastoma, the elucidation of which may have far-reaching implications, including improved risk classification at diagnosis and the identification of targets for treatment.",Journal Article,2121.0,14.0,The authors exploited a large database to investigate the outcomes of patients with high-risk in the contemporary era All patients with high-risk aged 12 years who were treated during induction at the authors institution from 2000 through 2011 were studied including 118 patients with MYCN-amplified MYCN disease and 127 patients aged 18 months with MYCN-nonamplified MYCN stage 4 disease A complete response/very good partial response CR/VGPR to induction was correlated with significantly superior event-free survival EFS P .001 and overall survival OS P .001 compared with a partial response or less Patients with MYCN and MYCN disease had similar rates of CR/VGPR to induction P .366 and those with MYCN and MYCN disease who attained a CR/VGPR had similar EFS P .346 and OS P .542 In contrast only MYCN patients had progressive disease as a response to induction P .001 and early death from progressive disease 366 days after diagnosis was significantly more common P .001 among those with MYCN disease Overall among patients who had a partial response or less MYCN patients had significantly inferior EFS P .001 and OS P .001 compared with MYCN patients which accounted for the significantly worse EFS P .008 and OS P .002 for the entire MYCN cohort versus the MYCN cohort Patients with MYCN high-risk display a broad continuous spectrum with regard to response and outcome whereas MYCN patients either have an excellent response to induction associated with good long-term outcome or develop early progressive disease with a poor outcome This extreme dichotomy in the clinical course of MYCN patients points to underlying biologic differences with MYCN the elucidation of which may have far-reaching implications including improved risk classification at diagnosis and the identification of targets for treatment,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 738, 5177, 8, 375, 609, 6, 963, 3, 123, 1, 7, 5, 64, 43, 4, 3, 2667, 1713, 62, 7, 5, 64, 43, 1032, 133, 60, 54, 11, 73, 190, 504, 28, 3, 738, 731, 29, 1081, 298, 1132, 11, 656, 141, 4002, 7, 5, 4068, 2429, 4068, 34, 2, 4080, 7, 1032, 203, 53, 5, 4068, 13339, 4068, 82, 39, 34, 8, 236, 51, 923, 1178, 450, 51, 684, 7657, 6, 504, 10, 438, 5, 97, 1123, 774, 115, 25, 1683, 19, 144, 2, 63, 25, 118, 19, 144, 72, 5, 8, 450, 51, 15, 299, 7, 5, 4068, 2, 4068, 34, 42, 288, 151, 1, 684, 7657, 6, 504, 19, 9797, 2, 135, 5, 4068, 2, 4068, 34, 54, 5105, 8, 684, 7657, 42, 288, 1683, 19, 9184, 2, 118, 19, 10895, 4, 748, 158, 4068, 7, 42, 1014, 34, 22, 8, 51, 6, 504, 19, 144, 2, 191, 273, 29, 1014, 34, 9797, 162, 50, 147, 10, 97, 80, 186, 19, 144, 107, 135, 5, 4068, 34, 63, 107, 7, 54, 42, 8, 450, 51, 15, 299, 4068, 7, 42, 97, 1663, 1683, 19, 144, 2, 118, 19, 144, 72, 5, 4068, 7, 92, 3688, 9, 3, 97, 639, 1683, 19, 2155, 2, 118, 19, 1111, 9, 3, 1797, 4068, 180, 185, 3, 4068, 180, 7, 5, 4068, 64, 43, 3640, 8, 2094, 1314, 1873, 5, 2539, 6, 51, 2, 228, 547, 4068, 7, 361, 47, 35, 1503, 51, 6, 504, 41, 5, 1178, 319, 337, 228, 15, 690, 191, 1014, 34, 5, 8, 334, 228, 26, 5611, 20252, 4, 3, 38, 906, 1, 4068, 7, 862, 6, 1181, 1283, 362, 5, 4068, 3, 7481, 1, 92, 68, 47, 3272, 6168, 1268, 141, 231, 43, 947, 28, 147, 2, 3, 911, 1, 637, 9, 24]",1818.0,24691684,176
"Phase I trial of a novel anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody, Hu14.18K322A, designed to decrease toxicity in children with refractory or recurrent neuroblastoma.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2014-04-07,"The addition of immunotherapy, including a combination of anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody (mAb), ch14.18, and cytokines, improves outcome for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. However, this therapy is limited by ch14.18-related toxicities that may be partially mediated by complement activation. We report the results of a phase I trial to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), safety profile, and pharmacokinetics of hu14.18K322A, a humanized anti-GD2 mAb with a single point mutation (K322A) that reduces complement-dependent lysis. Eligible patients with refractory or recurrent neuroblastoma received escalating doses of hu14.18K322A ranging from 2 to 70 mg/m(2) per day for 4 consecutive days every 28 days (one course). Thirty-eight patients (23 males; median age, 7.2 years) received a median of two courses (range, one to 15). Dose-limiting grade 3 or 4 toxicities occurred in four of 36 evaluable patients and were characterized by cough, asthenia, sensory neuropathy, anorexia, serum sickness, and hypertensive encephalopathy. The most common non-dose-limiting grade 3 or 4 toxicities during course one were pain (68%) and fever (21%). Six of 31 patients evaluable for response by iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine score had objective responses (four complete responses; two partial responses). The first-course pharmacokinetics of hu14.18K322A were best described by a two-compartment linear model. Median hu14.18K322A α (initial phase) and β (terminal phase) half-lives were 1.74 and 21.1 days, respectively. The MTD, and recommended phase II dose, of hu14.18K322A is 60 mg/m(2) per day for 4 days.

Identification of Wee1 as a novel therapeutic target for mutant RAS-driven acute leukemia and other malignancies.,Leukemia,Leukemia,2014-05-05,"Direct targeting of rat sarcoma (RAS), which is frequently mutated, has proven to be challenging, and inhibition of individual downstream RAS mediators has resulted in limited clinical efficacy. We designed a chemical screen to identify compounds capable of potentiating mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition in mutant RAS-positive leukemia, and identified a Wee1 inhibitor. Synergy was observed in both mutant neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS)- and mutant kirsten RAS viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)-positive acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell lines and primary patient samples. The observed synergy enhanced dephosphorylation of AKT, 4E-binding protein 1 and s6 kinase, and correlated with increased apoptosis. The specificity of Wee1 as the target of MK-1775 was validated by Wee1 knockdown, as well as partial reversal of drug combination-induced apoptosis by a cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) inhibitor. Importantly, we also extended our findings to other mutant RAS-expressing malignancies, including mutant NRAS-positive melanoma, and mutant KRAS-positive colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer and lung cancer.

Likelihood of bone recurrence in prior sites of metastasis in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2014-05-24,"Despite recent improvements in outcomes, 40% of children with high-risk neuroblastoma will experience relapse, facing a guarded prognosis for long-term cure. Whether recurrences are at new sites or sites of original disease may guide decision making during initial therapy. Eligible patients were retrospectively identified from institutional databases at first metastatic relapse of high-risk neuroblastoma. Included patients had disease involving metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG)-avid metastatic sites at diagnosis and first relapse, achieved a complete or partial response with no more than one residual MIBG-avid site before first relapse, and received no total body irradiation or therapy with (131)I-MIBG before first relapse. Anatomically defined metastatic sites were tracked from diagnosis through first relapse to determine tendency of disease to recur at previously involved versus uninvolved sites and to assess whether this pattern was influenced by site irradiation. Of 159 MIBG-avid metastatic sites identified among 43 patients at first relapse, 131 (82.4%) overlapped anatomically with the set of 525 sites present at diagnosis. This distribution was similar for bone sites, but patterns of relapse were more varied for the smaller subset of soft tissue metastases. Among all metastatic sites at diagnosis in our subsequently relapsed patient cohort, only 3 of 19 irradiated sites (15.8%) recurred as compared with 128 of 506 (25.3%) unirradiated sites. Metastatic bone relapse in neuroblastoma usually occurs at anatomic sites of previous disease. Metastatic sites identified at diagnosis that did not receive radiation during frontline therapy appeared to have a higher risk of involvement at first relapse relative to previously irradiated metastatic sites. These observations support the current paradigm of irradiating metastases that persist after induction chemotherapy in high-risk patients. Furthermore, they raise the hypothesis that metastatic sites appearing to clear with induction chemotherapy may also benefit from radiotherapeutic treatment modalities (external beam radiation or (131)I-MIBG).",Journal Article,2068.0,10.0,Despite recent improvements in outcomes 40 of children with high-risk will experience relapse facing a guarded prognosis for long-term cure Whether recurrences are at new sites or sites of original disease may guide decision making during initial therapy Eligible patients were retrospectively identified from institutional databases at first metastatic relapse of high-risk Included patients had disease involving metaiodobenzylguanidine MIBG -avid metastatic sites at diagnosis and first relapse achieved a complete or partial response with no more than one residual MIBG-avid site before first relapse and received no total body irradiation or therapy with 131 I-MIBG before first relapse Anatomically defined metastatic sites were tracked from diagnosis through first relapse to determine tendency of disease to recur at previously involved versus uninvolved sites and to assess whether this pattern was influenced by site irradiation Of 159 MIBG-avid metastatic sites identified among 43 patients at first relapse 131 82.4 overlapped anatomically with the set of 525 sites present at diagnosis This distribution was similar for sites but patterns of relapse were more varied for the smaller subset of soft tissue metastases Among all metastatic sites at diagnosis in our subsequently relapsed patient cohort only 3 of 19 irradiated sites 15.8 recurred as compared with 128 of 506 25.3 unirradiated sites Metastatic relapse in usually occurs at anatomic sites of previous disease Metastatic sites identified at diagnosis that did not receive radiation during frontline therapy appeared to have a higher risk of involvement at first relapse relative to previously irradiated metastatic sites These observations support the current paradigm of irradiating metastases that persist after induction chemotherapy in high-risk patients Furthermore they raise the hypothesis that metastatic sites appearing to clear with induction chemotherapy may also benefit from radiotherapeutic treatment modalities external beam radiation or 131 I-MIBG,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[550, 435, 1474, 4, 123, 327, 1, 541, 5, 64, 43, 303, 730, 429, 7917, 8, 21328, 356, 9, 319, 337, 1722, 317, 1593, 32, 28, 217, 633, 15, 633, 1, 2279, 34, 68, 1597, 948, 1079, 190, 388, 36, 625, 7, 11, 894, 108, 29, 1115, 2348, 28, 157, 113, 429, 1, 64, 43, 159, 7, 42, 34, 1267, 11285, 3574, 5189, 113, 633, 28, 147, 2, 157, 429, 513, 8, 236, 15, 450, 51, 5, 77, 80, 76, 104, 753, 3574, 5189, 606, 348, 157, 429, 2, 103, 77, 181, 642, 1104, 15, 36, 5, 2229, 70, 3574, 348, 157, 429, 9622, 395, 113, 633, 11, 9331, 29, 147, 298, 157, 429, 6, 223, 7135, 1, 34, 6, 5609, 28, 373, 646, 185, 7377, 633, 2, 6, 423, 317, 26, 1177, 10, 2574, 20, 606, 1104, 1, 5917, 3574, 5189, 113, 633, 108, 107, 601, 7, 28, 157, 429, 2229, 878, 39, 12117, 9622, 5, 3, 916, 1, 10223, 633, 364, 28, 147, 26, 1395, 10, 288, 9, 633, 84, 764, 1, 429, 11, 80, 2051, 9, 3, 2170, 697, 1, 1214, 246, 196, 107, 62, 113, 633, 28, 147, 4, 114, 1611, 591, 69, 180, 158, 27, 1, 326, 2398, 633, 167, 66, 3363, 22, 72, 5, 3990, 1, 9454, 243, 27, 11306, 633, 113, 429, 4, 2082, 1780, 28, 2745, 633, 1, 698, 34, 113, 633, 108, 28, 147, 17, 205, 44, 560, 121, 190, 3171, 36, 2121, 6, 47, 8, 142, 43, 1, 799, 28, 157, 429, 580, 6, 373, 2398, 113, 633, 46, 2172, 538, 3, 291, 2431, 1, 20248, 196, 17, 5589, 50, 504, 56, 4, 64, 43, 7, 798, 491, 5008, 3, 1492, 17, 113, 633, 6536, 6, 885, 5, 504, 56, 68, 120, 247, 29, 11924, 24, 1558, 1455, 1345, 121, 15, 2229, 70, 3574]",2037.0,24867534,226
Structural design of disialoganglioside GD2 and CD3-bispecific antibodies to redirect T cells for tumor therapy.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2014-06-19,"Antibody-based immunotherapy has proven efficacy for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. However, despite being the most efficient tumoricidal effectors, T cells are underutilized because they lack Fc receptors. Using a monovalent single-chain fragment (ScFv) platform, we engineered tandem scFv bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) that specifically target disialoganglioside (GD2) on tumor cells and CD3 on T cells. Structural variants of BsAbs were constructed and ranked based on binding to GD2, and on competency in inducing T-cell-mediated tumor cytotoxicity. In vitro thermal stability and binding measurements were used to characterize each of the constructs, and in silico molecular modeling was used to show how the orientation of the variable region heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains of the anti-GD2 ScFv could alter the conformations of key residues responsible for high affinity binding. We showed that the VH-VL orientation, the (GGGGS)3 linker, disulfide bond stabilization of scFv, when combined with an affinity matured mutation provided the most efficient BsAb to direct T cells to lyse GD2-positive tumor cells. In vivo, the optimized BsAb could efficiently inhibit melanoma and neuroblastoma xenograft growth.

Deep MicroRNA sequencing reveals downregulation of miR-29a in neuroblastoma central nervous system metastasis.,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",Genes Chromosomes Cancer,2014-06-05,"Central nervous system (CNS) is an increasingly common site of isolated metastasis for patients with Stage 4 neuroblastoma. To explore the microRNA (miRNA) profile of this metastatic process, miRNA sequencing was performed to identify miRNA sequence families with differential expression between tumor pairs (pre-CNS primary and CNS metastasis) from 13 patients with Stage 4 neuroblastoma. Seven miRNA sequence families had distinct expression in CNS metastases when compared with their corresponding pre-CNS primaries. MiR-7 was upregulated (3.75-fold), and miR-21, miR-22, miR-29a, miR-143, miR-199a-1-3p, and miR-199a-1-5p were downregulated (3.5-6.1-fold), all confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. MiR-29a, previously shown to be downregulated in a broad spectrum of solid tumors including neuroblastoma, had the most significant decrease in all 13 CNS metastases (P = 0.001). Its known onco-targets CDC6, CDK6, and DNMT3A, as well as B7-H3, an inhibitory ligand for T cells, and natural killer cells, were found to have higher differential expression in these 13 CNS metastases when compared with their paired primaries.

"Phase 1 evaluation of EZN-2208, a polyethylene glycol conjugate of SN38, in children adolescents and young adults with relapsed or refractory solid tumors.",Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2014-06-24,"EZN-2208 is a water-soluble PEGylated conjugate of the topoisomerase inhibitor SN38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. Compared to irinotecan, EZN-2208 has a prolonged half-life permitting extended exposure to SN38. EZN-2208 has demonstrated clinical tolerability and antitumor activity in adults with advanced solid tumors. This Phase 1 study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of EZN-2208 in children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors. EZN-2208 was administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion once every 21 days at five dose levels (12-30 mg/m(2) ). Filgrastim or pegfilgrastim was administered 24-48 hours after treatment with EZN-2208. The rolling-six design was used for dose determination. Thirty eligible patients (15 females; median [range] age 11.5 years [2-21 years]) were treated with EZN-2208. Dose-limiting diarrhea occurred in one patient receiving 16 mg/m(2) and dose-limiting dehydration was seen in one patient receiving 24 mg/m(2) . At dose levels above 16 mg/m(2) , Grade ≥3 myelosuppression was demonstrated in the majority of patients. Additional adverse events included nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.

Destabilizing LSD1 by Jade-2 promotes neurogenesis: an antibraking system in neural development.,Molecular cell,Mol. Cell,2014-07-10,"Histone H3K4 demethylase LSD1 plays an important role in stem cell biology, especially in the maintenance of the silencing of differentiation genes. However, how the function of LSD1 is regulated and the differentiation genes are derepressed are not understood. Here, we report that elimination of LSD1 promotes embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation toward neural lineage. We showed that the destabilization of LSD1 occurs posttranscriptionally via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by an E3 ubiquitin ligase, Jade-2. We demonstrated that Jade-2 is a major LSD1 negative regulator during neurogenesis in vitro and in vivo in both mouse developing cerebral cortices and zebra fish embryos. Apparently, Jade-2-mediated degradation of LSD1 acts as an antibraking system and serves as a quick adaptive mechanism for re-establishing epigenetic landscape without more laborious transcriptional regulations. As a potential anticancer strategy, Jade-2-mediated LSD1 degradation could potentially be used in neuroblastoma cells to induce differentiation toward postmitotic neurons.

Patient-specific dosimetry using pretherapy [¹²⁴I]m-iodobenzylguanidine ([¹²⁴I]mIBG) dynamic PET/CT imaging before [¹³¹I]mIBG targeted radionuclide therapy for neuroblastoma.,Molecular imaging and biology,Mol Imaging Biol,2015-04-01,"Iodine-131-m-iodobenzylguanidine ([(131)I]mIBG)-targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) is a standard treatment for recurrent or refractory neuroblastoma with response rates of 30-40 %. The aim of this study is to demonstrate patient-specific dosimetry using quantitative [(124)I]mIBG positron emission tomography/X-ray computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging with a GEometry ANd Tracking 4 (Geant4)-based Monte Carlo method for better treatment planning. A Monte Carlo dosimetry method was developed using the Geant4 toolkit with voxelized anatomical geometry and source distribution as input. The presegmented hybrid computational human phantoms developed by the University of Florida and the National Cancer Institute (UF/NCI) were used as a surrogate to characterize the anatomy of a given patient. S values for I-131 were estimated by the phantoms coupled with Geant4 and compared with those estimated by OLINDA|EXM and MCNPX for the newborn model. To obtain patient-specific biodistribution of [(131)I]mIBG, a 10-year-old girl with relapsed neuroblastoma was imaged with [(124)I]mIBG PET/CT at four time points prior to the planned [(131)I]mIBG TRT. The organ- and tumor-absorbed doses of the clinical case were estimated with the Geant4 method using the modified UF/NCI 10-year-old phantom with tumors and the patient-specific residence time. For the newborn model, the Geant4 S values were consistent with the MCNPX S values. The S value ratio of the Geant4 method to OLINDA|EXM ranged from 0.08 to 6.5 of all major organs. The [(131)I]mIBG residence time quantified from the pretherapy [(124)I]mIBG PET/CT imaging of the 10-year-old patient was mostly comparable to those previously reported. Organ-absorbed dose for the salivary glands was 98.0 Gy, heart wall 36.5 Gy, and liver 34.3 Gy, while tumor-absorbed dose ranged from 143.9 to 1,641.3 Gy in different sites. Patient-specific dosimetry for [(131)I]mIBG TRT was accomplished using pretherapy [(124)I]mIBG PET/CT imaging and a Geant4-based Monte Carlo dosimetry method.

"Clinical, biologic, and prognostic differences on the basis of primary tumor site in neuroblastoma: a report from the international neuroblastoma risk group project.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2014-08-25,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is a heterogeneous tumor arising from sympathetic tissues. The impact of primary tumor site in influencing the heterogeneity of NB remains unclear. Children younger than age 21 years diagnosed with NB or ganglioneuroblastoma between 1990 and 2002 and with known primary site were identified from the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group database. Data were compared between sites with respect to clinical and biologic features, as well as event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Among 8,369 children, 47% had adrenal tumors. All evaluated clinical and biologic variables differed statistically between primary sites. The features that were > 10% discrepant between sites were stage 4 disease, MYCN amplification, elevated ferritin, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and segmental chromosomal aberrations, all of which were more frequent in adrenal versus nonadrenal tumors (P < .001). Adrenal tumors were more likely than nonadrenal tumors (adjusted odds ratio, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.67 to 2.63; P < .001) and thoracic tumors were less likely than nonthoracic tumors (adjusted odds ratio, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.39; P < .001) to have MYCN amplification after controlling for age, stage, and histologic grade. EFS and OS differed significantly according to the primary site (P < .001 for both comparisons).

Clinicopathologic features and outcomes of patients with lung adenocarcinomas harboring BRAF mutations in the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium.,Cancer,Cancer,2014-10-01,"The advent of effective targeted therapy for BRAF(V600E) -mutant lung adenocarcinomas necessitates further exploration of the unique clinical features and behavior of advanced-stage BRAF-mutant lung adenocarcinomas. Data were reviewed for patients with advanced lung adenocarcinomas enrolled in the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium whose tumors underwent testing for mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), AKT1, BRAF, dual-specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1), neuroblastoma RAS viral (v-ras) oncogene homolog (NRAS), and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit α (PIK3CA); for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations; and for MET amplification. Twenty-one BRAF mutations were identified in 951 patients with adenocarcinomas (2.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4%-3.4%): 17 (81%; 95% CI, 60%-92%) were BRAF(V600E) mutations, and 4 were non-BRAF(V600E) mutations. Among the 733 cases tested for all 10 genes, BRAF mutations were more likely to occur than most other genotypic abnormalities in current or former smokers (BRAF vs sensitizing EGFR, 82% vs 36%, mid-P < .001; BRAF vs ALK, 39%, mid-P = .003; BRAF vs other mutations, 49%, mid-P = .02; BRAF vs patients with more than 1 oncogenic driver [doubleton], 46%, mid-P = .04.) The double-mutation rate was 16% among patients with BRAF mutations but 5% among patients with other genomic abnormalities (mid-P = .045). Differences were not found in survival between patients with BRAF mutations and those with other genomic abnormalities (P > .20). BRAF mutations occurred in 2.2% of advanced-stage lung adenocarcinomas, were most commonly V600E, and were associated with distinct clinicopathologic features in comparison with other genomic subtypes and with a high mutation rate in more than 1 gene.

Part A (single dose of NTX-010) enrolled 13 patients at three dose levels (1 × 10(9) viral particles (vp)/kg [n = 6], 1 × 10(10) vp/kg [n = 3], 1 × 10(11) vp/kg [n = 4]). Diagnoses included neuroblastoma (n = 9), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 2), carcinoid tumor (n = 1), and adrenocorticocarcinoma (n = 1). Part B added cyclophosphamide (CTX) (oral CTX (25 mg/m(2) /day) days 1-14 and IV CTX (750 mg/m(2) ) days 8 and 29) to two doses of NTX-010 (1 × 10(11) vp/kg, days 8 and 29). Nine patients enrolled to Part B. Diagnoses included neuroblastoma (n = 3), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 1), Wilms tumor (n = 3), and adrenocorticocarcinoma (n = 2). Twelve patients on Part A were evaluable for toxicity. There was a single DLT (grade 3 pain) at dose level 1. Additional grade ≥ 3 related adverse events (AEs) included leukopenia (n = 1), neutropenia (n = 3), lymphopenia (n = 3), and tumor pain (n = 1). No DLTs occurred on part B. Other grade ≥ 3 related AEs on Part B included: Leukopenia (n = 3), nausea (n = 1), emesis (n = 1), anemia (n = 1), neutropenia (n = 4), platelets (n = 1), alanine aminotransferase (n = 1), and lymphopenia (n = 2).

Comparison of pain outcomes between two anti-GD2 antibodies in patients with neuroblastoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2014-11-08,"Addition of anti-GD2 antibody ch14.18 to the treatment of neuroblastoma has improved outcomes. The most common side effect of ch14.18 is neuropathic pain, which may in part be complement-mediated. Hu14.18K322A is a humanized anti-GD2 antibody designed to diminish complement activation and induce less pain. We compare the pain outcomes in patients treated with ch14.18 and those treated with hu14.18K322A, and explore dose-dependent relationships between pain scores, opioid requirements, and complement levels in patients treated with hu14.18K322A. Opioid (morphine equivalent mg/kg) and anxiolytic requirements during course 1 (4 days) in patients treated with hu14.18K322A and ch14.18 were reviewed. Correlations between antibody dose and pain scores, opioid requirements, and complement levels were examined for patients receiving hu14.18K322A. Patients treated with hu14.18K322A (n = 19) had lower opioid requirements than those who received ch14.18 (n = 9). The differences in median opioid requirements (mg/kg) were statistically significant for the overall course (1.57 vs. 2.41, P = 0.019) as well as for Days 3 (0.34 vs. 0.65, P = 0.005), and 4 (0.32 vs. 0.64, P = 0.010). No difference in anxiolytic use was observed between the two groups.

[et al] = Zeitschrift fur Kinderchirurgie,Eur J Pediatr Surg,2014-12-08,"Neuroblastoma prognosis varies tremendously based on the stage and biologic features of the tumor. Treatment varies depending on the risk group and can range from surgery alone for stage 1 tumors to aggressive multimodality treatment for MYCN-amplified tumors. Although surgery plays a role in the diagnosis and management of all stages of neuroblastoma, the importance of that role, especially the extent of resection, in high-risk neuroblastoma continues to evolve. In the past five years, there have been several advances in neuroblastoma surgery. Studies have demonstrated that patients with low-risk disease can be treated with surgery alone, and in a subset of patients who are neonatally diagnosed with adrenal tumors, surgery can be avoided in 80%. Recent abstracts have supported a role for >90% resection of the primary tumor in high-risk patients.

Retargeting T cells to GD2 pentasaccharide on human tumors using Bispecific humanized antibody.,Cancer immunology research,Cancer Immunol Res,2014-12-26,"Anti-disialoganglioside GD2 IgG antibodies have shown clinical efficacy in solid tumors that lack human leukocyte antigens (e.g., neuroblastoma) by relying on Fc-dependent cytotoxicity. However, there are pain side effects secondary to complement activation. T-cell retargeting bispecific antibodies (BsAb) also have clinical potential, but it is thus far only effective against liquid tumors. In this study, a fully humanized hu3F8-BsAb was developed, in which the anti-CD3 huOKT3 single-chain Fv fragment (ScFv) was linked to the carboxyl end of the anti-GD2 hu3F8 IgG1 light chain, and was aglycosylated at N297 of Fc to prevent complement activation and cytokine storm. In vitro, hu3F8-BsAb activated T cells through classic immunologic synapses, inducing GD2-specific tumor cytotoxicity at femtomolar EC50 with >10⁵-fold selectivity over normal tissues, releasing Th1 cytokines (TNFα, IFNγ, and IL2) when GD2⁺ tumors were present. In separate murine neuroblastoma and melanoma xenograft models, intravenous hu3F8-BsAb activated T cells in situ and recruited intravenous T cells for tumor ablation, significantly prolonging survival from local recurrence or from metastatic disease. Hu3F8-BsAb, but not control BsAb, drove T cells and monocytes to infiltrate tumor stroma. These monocytes were necessary for sustained T-cell proliferation and/or survival and contributed significantly to the antitumor effect.

HspB8 is neuroprotective during oxygen glucose deprivation and reperfusion.,Current neurovascular research,Curr Neurovasc Res,2015-01-01,"Heat shock protein B8 (HspB8) is a chaperone protein that is highly and constitutively expressed in the brain, cardiac tissue and many other organs. Recently, it has been shown that HspB8 can enhance cardiac function and render cardioprotection. However, the potential benefits of HspB8 action on ischemic stroke and the underlying mechanism(s) are largely unknown. To investigate whether HspB8 exerts protective effects on in vitro ischemia/ reperfusion (I/R) injury, mouse neuroblastoma cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R). At first, we investigated and described the HspB8 expression and distribution in N2A cells exposed to OGD/R. Expressions of HspB8 were upregulated in mouse N2A cells after OGD/R, both at mRNA and protein levels. The level of HspB8 began increased after the OGD/R and peaked at 12 hour (12h) after the reperfusion, then declined at 24-hour time points, however, the level of HspB8 was still significantly increased compared to controls. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the expressed HspB8 was constitutively localized in the cytoplasm and at the periphery of the nucleus. Nuclear HspB8 levels increased after OGD/R compared with levels in the control, beginning as early as 4h reperfusion, the most conspicuous nuclear HspB8 staining was observed after 24h of reperfusion. Furthermore, overexpression of HspB8 reduced OGD/R -induced apoptosis by reducing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that increased HspB8 expression and its nuclear shift in mouse N2A neuroblastoma cells protected against I/R injury, resulting in reduced apoptosis with the decrease of the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol. Therefore, HspB8 might play a fundamental role in opposing and alleviating I/R injury in primary myocardial cells, and it may constitute a new therapeutic target for cerebral ischemic diseases. ",Journal Article,1846.0,7.0,Heat shock protein B8 HspB8 is a chaperone protein that is highly and constitutively expressed in the brain tissue and many other organs Recently it has been shown that HspB8 can enhance function and render cardioprotection However the potential benefits of HspB8 action on ischemic stroke and the underlying mechanism s are largely unknown To investigate whether HspB8 exerts protective effects on in vitro ischemia/ reperfusion I/R injury mouse cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation OGD/R At first we investigated and described the HspB8 expression and distribution in N2A cells exposed to OGD/R Expressions of HspB8 were upregulated in mouse N2A cells after OGD/R both at mRNA and protein levels The level of HspB8 began increased after the OGD/R and peaked at 12 hour 12h after the reperfusion then declined at 24-hour time points however the level of HspB8 was still significantly increased compared to controls Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the expressed HspB8 was constitutively localized in the cytoplasm and at the periphery of the nucleus Nuclear HspB8 levels increased after OGD/R compared with levels in the control beginning as early as 4h reperfusion the most conspicuous nuclear HspB8 staining was observed after 24h of reperfusion Furthermore overexpression of HspB8 reduced OGD/R -induced apoptosis by reducing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol In conclusion our data demonstrated that increased HspB8 expression and its nuclear shift in mouse N2A cells protected against I/R injury resulting in reduced apoptosis with the decrease of the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol Therefore HspB8 might play a fundamental role in opposing and alleviating I/R injury in primary myocardial cells and it may constitute a new therapeutic target for cerebral ischemic diseases,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"[3545, 3971, 178, 38628, 15435, 16, 8, 7255, 178, 17, 16, 561, 2, 2818, 570, 4, 3, 342, 246, 2, 445, 127, 2285, 761, 192, 71, 85, 443, 17, 15435, 122, 1304, 343, 2, 7873, 23760, 137, 3, 174, 1141, 1, 15435, 1578, 23, 6588, 4408, 2, 3, 1181, 670, 695, 32, 1733, 860, 6, 963, 317, 15435, 5685, 2864, 176, 23, 4, 439, 5675, 23244, 70, 668, 2730, 830, 37, 11, 4325, 6, 2848, 2522, 1868, 2, 29637, 29638, 668, 28, 157, 21, 565, 2, 1027, 3, 15435, 55, 2, 1395, 4, 14262, 37, 2234, 6, 29638, 668, 4249, 1, 15435, 11, 2684, 4, 830, 14262, 37, 50, 29638, 668, 110, 28, 956, 2, 178, 148, 3, 301, 1, 15435, 4603, 101, 50, 3, 29638, 668, 2, 11095, 28, 133, 2583, 48774, 50, 3, 23244, 818, 3054, 28, 259, 2583, 98, 862, 137, 3, 301, 1, 15435, 10, 1234, 97, 101, 72, 6, 535, 4130, 65, 553, 17, 3, 570, 15435, 10, 2818, 909, 4, 3, 4558, 2, 28, 3, 9668, 1, 3, 4262, 928, 15435, 148, 101, 50, 29638, 668, 72, 5, 148, 4, 3, 182, 2948, 22, 191, 22, 30913, 23244, 3, 96, 21329, 928, 15435, 1029, 10, 164, 50, 12551, 1, 23244, 798, 851, 1, 15435, 405, 29638, 668, 277, 351, 20, 1818, 3, 2008, 1, 4155, 256, 29, 5443, 6, 11107, 4, 1221, 114, 74, 264, 17, 101, 15435, 55, 2, 211, 928, 3024, 4, 830, 14262, 37, 5541, 480, 70, 668, 2730, 1113, 4, 405, 351, 5, 3, 775, 1, 3, 2008, 1, 4155, 256, 29, 5443, 6, 11107, 673, 15435, 822, 1343, 8, 4595, 200, 4, 9187, 2, 12956, 70, 668, 2730, 4, 86, 5098, 37, 2, 192, 68, 4999, 8, 217, 189, 283, 9, 3549, 6588, 1342]",1865.0,25557374,221
Bone marrow minimal residual disease was an early response marker and a consistent independent predictor of survival after anti-GD2 immunotherapy.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2015-01-05,"Immunotherapy is a standard of care for children with high-risk neuroblastoma, where bone marrow (BM) is the predominant metastatic site. Early response markers of minimal residual disease (MRD) in the BM that are also predictive of survival could help individualize patient therapies. After achieving first remission (n = 163), primary refractory disease (n = 102), or second remission (n = 95), children with stage 4 neuroblastoma received anti-GD2 3F8 antibody immunotherapy. BM MRD before 3F8 treatment and after cycle 2 (postMRD) was measured using a four-marker panel (B4GALNT1, PHOX2B, CCND1, and ISL1) by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic variables were tested in both univariable and multivariable analyses, and MRD markers were further assessed individually and in combination as binary composite (postMRD: 0 and 1) and as equal sum (postMRDSum: 0 to 4) using the Cox regression models, and their predictive accuracy was determined by the concordance index. When BM was evaluated after cycle 2, individual markers were highly predictive of PFS and OS. The prediction accuracy improved when they were combined in postMRDSum. A multivariable model taking into account all the variables significant in the univariable analyses identified postMRDSum to be independently predictive of PFS and OS. When the model for OS also included missing killer immunoglobulin-like receptor ligand, human antimouse antibody response, and the enrollment disease status, the concordance index was 0.704.

Osteochondroma in long-term survivors of high-risk neuroblastoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2015-02-27,"Osteochondromas are benign bony protrusions that can be spontaneous or associated with radiotherapy (RT). Current treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma includes dose-intensive chemotherapy, local RT, an anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody (MoAb), and isotretinoin. Late effects are emerging. The authors examined osteochondromas in 362 patients who were aged <10 years when diagnosed with neuroblastoma, had received a MoAb plus isotretinoin since 2000, and had survived >24 months from the time of the first dose of the MoAb. The incidence rate of osteochondroma was determined using the competing risks approach, in which the primary event was osteochondroma calculated from the date of neuroblastoma diagnosis and the competing event was death without osteochondroma. A total of 21 osteochondroma cases were found among 14 patients who were aged 5.7 to 15.3 years (median, 10.4 years) and 3.1 to 11.2 years (median, 8.2 years) from the time of neuroblastoma diagnosis. The cumulative incidence rate was 0.6% at 5 years and 4.9% at 10 years from the neuroblastoma diagnosis. Nine osteochondromas were revealed incidentally during assessments of neuroblastoma disease status or bone age.

A dual-specific anti-IGF-1/IGF-2 human monoclonal antibody alone and in combination with temsirolimus for therapy of neuroblastoma.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2015-05-19,"The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), IGF-1 and IGF-2, have been implicated in the growth, survival and metastasis of a broad range of malignancies including pediatric tumors. They bind to the IGF receptor type 1 (IGF-1R) and the insulin receptor (IR) which are overexpressed in many types of solid malignancies. Activation of the IR by IGF-2 results in increased survival of tumor cells. We have previously identified a novel human monoclonal antibody, m708.5, which binds with high (pM) affinity to both human IGF-1 and IGF-2, and potently inhibits phosphorylation of the IGF-1R and the IR in tumor cells. m708.5 exhibited strong antitumor activity as a single agent against most cell lines derived from neuroblastoma, Ewing family of tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma and osteosarcoma. When tested in neuroblastoma cell lines, it showed strong synergy with temsirolimus and synergy with chemotherapeutic agents in vitro. In xenograft models, the combination of m708.5 and temsirolimus significantly inhibited neuroblastoma growth and prolonged mouse survival. Taken together, these results support the clinical development of m708.5 for pediatric solid tumors with potential for synergy with chemotherapy and mTOR inhibitors.

Low incidence of radionecrosis in children treated with conventional radiation therapy and intrathecal radioimmunotherapy.,Journal of neuro-oncology,J. Neurooncol.,2015-05-06,"Radionecrosis is a potentially devastating complication of external beam radiotherapy (XRT). Intraventricular compartmental radioimmunotherapy (cRIT) using (131)I-3F8 or (131)I-8H9 can eradicate malignant cells in the CSF. The incidence of radionecrosis using cRIT (131)I based intraventricular radioimmunotherapy, when used alone or in combination with conventional craniospinal CSI-XRT is unknown. We retrospectively analyzed the incidence of radionecrosis in two cohorts of pediatric patients treated with both CSI-XRT and cRIT at MSKCC since 2003: patients with metastatic CNS neuroblastoma (NB) and medulloblastoma (MB). 94 patients received both CSI-XRT and cRIT, two received cRIT alone, median follow up 41.5 months (6.5-124.8 months). Mean CSI-XRT dose was 28 Gy (boost to the primary tumor site up to 54 Gy) in the MB cohort, and CSI XRT dose 18-21 Gy (boost to 30 Gy for focal parenchymal mass) in the NB cohort. For MB patients, 20 % had focal re-irradiation for a second or more subsequent relapse, mean repeat-XRT dose was 27.5 Gy; seven patients with NB had additional focal XRT. Median CSF cRIT dose was 18.6 Gy in the MB cohort and 32.1 in the NB cohort. One asymptomatic patient underwent resection of 0.6-cm hemorrhagic periventricular white-matter lesion confirmed to be necrosis and granulation tissue, 2.5 years after XRT. The risk of radionecrosis in children treated with XRT and cRIT appears minimal (~1 %). No neurologic deficits secondary to radionecrosis have been observed in long-term survivors treated with both modalities, including patients who underwent re-XRT.

Exosome-mediated transfer of microRNAs within the tumor microenvironment and neuroblastoma resistance to chemotherapy.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2015-05-13,"How exosomic microRNAs (miRNAs) contribute to the development of drug resistance in the context of the tumor microenvironment has not been previously described in neuroblastoma (NBL). Coculture experiments were performed to assess exosomic transfer of miR-21 from NBL cells to human monocytes and miR-155 from human monocytes to NBL cells. Luciferase reporter assays were performed to assess miR-155 targeting of TERF1 in NBL cells. Tumor growth was measured in NBL xenografts treated with Cisplatin and peritumoral exosomic miR-155 (n = 6 mice per group) CD163, miR-155, and TERF1 levels were assessed in 20 NBL primary tissues by Human Exon Arrays and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Student's t test was used to evaluate the differences between treatment groups. All statistical tests were two-sided. miR-21 mean fold change (f.c.) was 12.08±0.30 (P < .001) in human monocytes treated with NBL derived exosomes for 48 hours, and miR-155 mean f.c. was 4.51±0.25 (P < .001) in NBL cells cocultured with human monocytes for 48 hours. TERF1 mean luciferase activity in miR-155 transfected NBL cells normalized to scrambled was 0.36 ± 0.05 (P <.001).

Patients aged 2.5-15 years with relapsed neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma were eligible to receive DAC followed by DC pulsed with overlapping peptides derived from full-length MAGE-A1, MAGE-A3 and NY-ESO-1. The primary endpoints were to assess the feasibility and tolerability of this regimen. Each of four cycles consisted of week 1: DAC 10 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days and weeks 2 and 3: DC vaccine once weekly. Fifteen patients were enrolled in the study, of which 10 were evaluable. Generation of DC was highly feasible for all enrolled patients. The treatment regimen was generally well tolerated, with the major toxicity being DAC-related myelosuppression in 5/10 patients. Six of nine patients developed a response to MAGE-A1, MAGE-A3 or NY-ESO-1 peptides post-vaccine. Due to limitations in number of cells available for analysis, controls infected with a virus encoding relevant genes have not been performed. Objective responses were documented in 1/10 patients who had a complete response. Of the two patients who had no evidence of disease at the time of treatment, one remains disease-free 2 years post-therapy, while the other experienced a relapse 10 months post-therapy.

Melanocytic nevi excised during B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) inhibitor therapy: A study of 19 lesions from 10 patients.,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,J. Am. Acad. Dermatol.,2015-07-16,"There are limited descriptions of histopathology and immune profiles of new or changing melanocytic nevi in the setting of B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) inhibitor therapy. We sought to identify their distinctive features. Clinical charts and histologic review, neuroblastoma RAS viral (v-ras) oncogene homolog genotyping, and immunohistochemistry for HMB-45, BRAFV600E, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK), phosphorylated protein kinase B, CD4, and CD8 were performed on 19 melanocytic nevi from 10 patients and 23 control nevi. BRAF inhibitors were administered for metastatic melanoma (7), colonic adenocarcinoma (2), and papillary thyroid carcinoma (1). The average duration of BRAF inhibition before lesion excision was 8 months. Frequently associated histologic features included pigmentation of the stratum corneum, hyperpigmented keratinocytes, dermal melanophages, and deep HMB-45 expression.

This was a retrospective cohort analysis of 218 patients with refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma treated with (131)I-MIBG at UCSF between 1996 and 2014. Results were obtained by chart review and database abstraction. Baseline characteristics and response rates between relapsed patients and refractory patients were compared using Fisher exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests, and differences in overall survival (OS) were compared using the log-rank test. The response rate (complete and partial response) to (131)I-MIBG-based therapies for all patients was 27%. There was no difference in response rates between relapsed and refractory patients. However, after (131)I-MIBG, 24% of relapsed patients had progressive disease compared to only 9% of refractory patients, and 39% of relapsed patients had stable disease compared to 59% of refractory patients (p=0.02).

The role of systemic therapy in the management of sinonasal cancer: A critical review.,Cancer treatment reviews,Cancer Treat. Rev.,2015-07-31,"Due to the rarity and the variety of histological types of sinonasal cancers, there is a paucity of data regarding strategy for their optimal treatment. Generally, outcomes of advanced and higher grade tumors remain unsatisfactory, despite the employment of sophisticated surgical approaches, technical advances in radiation techniques and the use of heavy ion particles. In this context, we critically evaluated the role of systemic therapy as part of a multidisciplinary approach to locally advanced disease. Induction chemotherapy has shown encouraging activity and could have a role in the multimodal treatment of patients with advanced sinonasal tumors. For epithelial tumors, the most frequently employed chemotherapy is cisplatin, in combination with either 5-fluorouracil, taxane, ifosfamide, or vincristine. Only limited experiences with concurrent chemoradiation exist with sinonasal cancer. The role of systemic treatment for each histological type (intestinal-type adenocarcinoma, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma, sinonasal neuroendocrine carcinoma, olfactory neuroblastoma, sinonasal primary mucosal melanoma, sarcoma) is discussed. The treatment of SNC requires a multimodal approach. Employment of systemic therapy for locally advanced disease could result in better outcomes, and optimize the therapeutic armamentarium.

A distinct gene expression signature characterizes human neuroblastoma cancer stem cells.,Stem cell research,Stem Cell Res,2015-08-20,"Neuroblastoma, a malignancy of multipotent embryonic neural crest cells, is the most common extracranial solid cancer in childhood and most common cancer in infancy. Cellular phenotype has been shown to be an important determinant of the malignant potential in human neuroblastoma cells and tumors. Whereas neuroblastic (N-type) are moderately malignant and nonneuronal (S-type) cells are nonmalignant, I-type stem cells are highly tumorigenic, irrespective of N-myc amplification status. In the present study, we sought to determine which genes were overexpressed in the I-type cells which might characterize and maintain the stem cell state and/or malignancy of human neuroblastoma cancer stem cells. We used a microarray platform to compare the steady-state expression levels of mRNAs from 13 human neuroblastoma cell lines representing the three cellular phenotypes. Using qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses, we identified seven genes whose expression is consistently elevated exclusively in neuroblastoma cancer stem cells: CD133, KIT, NOTCH1, GPRC5C, PIGF2, TRKB, and LNGFR. Moreover, we show that the genes are phenotype specific, as differentiation of I-type BE(2)-C cells to either an N- or S-type morphology results in significantly reduced mRNA expression.

Impact of Whole-Body Radiation Dose on Response and Toxicity in Patients With Neuroblastoma After Therapy With 131 I-Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG).,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2015-10-27,"(131) I-metaiodobenzylguanidine ((131) I-MIBG) is a targeted radiopharmaceutical for patients with neuroblastoma. Despite its tumor-specific uptake, the treatment with (131) I-MIBG results in whole-body radiation exposure. Our aim was to correlate whole-body radiation dose (WBD) from (131) I-MIBG with tumor response, toxicities, and other clinical factors. This retrospective cohort analysis included 213 patients with high-risk neuroblastoma treated with (131) I-MIBG at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital between 1996 and 2015. WBD was determined from radiation exposure rate measurements. The relationship between WBD ordered tertiles and variables were analyzed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test of trend, Kruskal-Wallis test, and one-way analysis of variance. Correlation between WBD and continuous variables was analyzed using Pearson correlation and Spearman rank correlation. WBD correlated with (131) I-MIBG administered activity, particularly with (131) I-MIBG per kilogram (P < 0.001). Overall response rate did not differ significantly among the three tertiles of WBD. Correlation between response by relative Curie score and WBD was of borderline significance, with patients receiving a lower WBD showing greater reduction in osteomedullary metastases by Curie score (rs = 0.16, P = 0.049). There were no significant ordered trends among tertiles in any toxicity measures (grade 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia < 20,000/μl, and grade > 1 hypothyroidism). This study showed that (131) I-MIBG activity per kilogram correlates with WBD and suggests that activity per kilogram will predict WBD in most patients. Within the range of activities prescribed, there was no correlation between WBD and either response or toxicity. Future studies should evaluate tumor dosimetry, rather than just WBD, as a tool for predicting response following therapy with (131) I-MIBG.",Journal Article,1547.0,9.0,"131 I-metaiodobenzylguanidine 131 I-MIBG is a targeted radiopharmaceutical for patients with Despite its tumor-specific uptake the treatment with 131 I-MIBG results in whole-body radiation exposure Our aim was to correlate whole-body radiation dose WBD from 131 I-MIBG with tumor response toxicities and other clinical factors This retrospective cohort analysis included 213 patients with high-risk treated with 131 I-MIBG at UCSF Benioff Children 's Hospital between 1996 and 2015 WBD was determined from radiation exposure rate measurements The relationship between WBD ordered tertiles and variables were analyzed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test of trend Kruskal-Wallis test and one-way analysis of variance Correlation between WBD and continuous variables was analyzed using Pearson correlation and Spearman rank correlation WBD correlated with 131 I-MIBG administered activity particularly with 131 I-MIBG per kilogram P 0.001 Overall response rate did not differ significantly among the three tertiles of WBD Correlation between response by relative Curie score and WBD was of borderline significance with patients receiving a lower WBD showing greater reduction in osteomedullary metastases by Curie score rs 0.16 P 0.049 There were no significant ordered trends among tertiles in any toxicity measures grade 4 neutropenia thrombocytopenia 20,000/μl and grade 1 hypothyroidism This study showed that 131 I-MIBG activity per kilogram correlates with WBD and suggests that activity per kilogram will predict WBD in most patients Within the range of activities prescribed there was no correlation between WBD and either response or toxicity Future studies should evaluate tumor dosimetry rather than just WBD as a tool for predicting response following therapy with 131 I-MIBG",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2229, 70, 11285, 2229, 70, 3574, 16, 8, 238, 10522, 9, 7, 5, 550, 211, 30, 112, 1135, 3, 24, 5, 2229, 70, 3574, 99, 4, 902, 642, 121, 645, 114, 1130, 10, 6, 1513, 902, 642, 121, 61, 20898, 29, 2229, 70, 3574, 5, 30, 51, 385, 2, 127, 38, 130, 26, 459, 180, 65, 159, 5833, 7, 5, 64, 43, 73, 5, 2229, 70, 3574, 28, 15272, 67043, 541, 292, 702, 59, 2648, 2, 1483, 20898, 10, 509, 29, 121, 645, 116, 1685, 3, 858, 59, 20898, 7591, 10453, 2, 682, 11, 311, 75, 12211, 11618, 14496, 412, 1, 853, 8800, 8875, 412, 2, 104, 2255, 65, 1, 4446, 816, 59, 20898, 2, 1314, 682, 10, 311, 75, 4720, 816, 2, 5061, 1026, 816, 20898, 438, 5, 2229, 70, 3574, 468, 128, 823, 5, 2229, 70, 3574, 379, 6543, 19, 13, 144, 63, 51, 116, 205, 44, 1505, 97, 107, 3, 169, 10453, 1, 20898, 816, 59, 51, 20, 580, 21260, 368, 2, 20898, 10, 1, 2932, 724, 5, 7, 357, 8, 280, 20898, 2069, 378, 628, 4, 22489, 196, 20, 21260, 368, 2250, 13, 245, 19, 13, 5121, 125, 11, 77, 93, 7591, 1963, 107, 10453, 4, 500, 155, 1018, 88, 39, 778, 1340, 179, 984, 5513, 2, 88, 14, 4147, 26, 45, 224, 17, 2229, 70, 3574, 128, 379, 6543, 1871, 5, 20898, 2, 844, 17, 128, 379, 6543, 303, 678, 20898, 4, 96, 7, 262, 3, 184, 1, 2042, 2746, 125, 10, 77, 816, 59, 20898, 2, 361, 51, 15, 155, 508, 94, 257, 376, 30, 4113, 1832, 76, 4673, 20898, 22, 8, 1515, 9, 1434, 51, 366, 36, 5, 2229, 70, 3574]",1783.0,26506090,70
Extended Sedation With Continuous Midazolam or Dexmedetomidine Infusion for Young Children Receiving 131 I-MIBG Radiopharmaceutical Therapy for Advanced Neuroblastoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2015-11-19,"(131) I-MIBG is increasingly used for treating neuroblastoma; however, administration requires careful adherence to radiation safety guidelines. We describe our experience using continuous sedation to facilitate safe (131) I-MIBG therapy for young children. Patients were included in this case series if they received continuous midazolam or dexmedetomidine infusion for sedation during (131) I-MIBG therapy from November 1, 2012, to October 1, 2014. Key outcomes included adequacy of sedation for both (131) I-MIBG infusion and the duration of radioactive isolation, as well as sedative-related toxicities. Additionally, nuclear medicine scans before and after (131) I-MIBG therapy were assessed using the Curie score. These scores were compared qualitatively between midazolam, dexmedetomidine, and control (no sedative infusion) groups. Of the 13 patients receiving continuous sedation for (131) I-MIBG therapy, seven achieved adequate sedation with midazolam, five achieved adequate sedation with dexmedetomidine, one patient (1.6 years old) failed to achieve adequate sedation with either medication and did not receive (131) I-MIBG therapy. Sedation was generally well tolerated. Common side effects for dexmedetomidine infusion included hypotension and relative bradycardia. Both treatment and control groups had multiple patients with increased Curie scores post-(131) I-MIBG therapy. However, one patient in the midazolam group and two in the dexmedetomidine group had decreased Curie scores after (131) I-MIBG therapy, while none decreased in the control group. Although we cannot exclude the possibility of some inhibition of (131) I-MIBG uptake by midazolam or dexmedetomidine, this case series suggests that continuous infusions of either agent can provide effective sedation to allow safe administration of (131) I-MIBG to young patients.",Comparative Study,1524.0,3.0,131 I-MIBG is increasingly used for treating however administration requires careful adherence to radiation safety guidelines We describe our experience using continuous sedation to facilitate safe 131 I-MIBG therapy for young children Patients were included in this case series if they received continuous midazolam or dexmedetomidine infusion for sedation during 131 I-MIBG therapy from November 1 2012 to October 1 2014 Key outcomes included adequacy of sedation for both 131 I-MIBG infusion and the duration of radioactive isolation as well as sedative-related toxicities Additionally nuclear medicine scans before and after 131 I-MIBG therapy were assessed using the Curie score These scores were compared qualitatively between midazolam dexmedetomidine and control no sedative infusion groups Of the 13 patients receiving continuous sedation for 131 I-MIBG therapy seven achieved adequate sedation with midazolam five achieved adequate sedation with dexmedetomidine one patient 1.6 years old failed to achieve adequate sedation with either medication and did not receive 131 I-MIBG therapy Sedation was generally well tolerated Common side effects for dexmedetomidine infusion included hypotension and relative bradycardia Both treatment and control groups had multiple patients with increased Curie scores post- 131 I-MIBG therapy However one patient in the midazolam group and two in the dexmedetomidine group had decreased Curie scores after 131 I-MIBG therapy while none decreased in the control group Although we can not exclude the possibility of some inhibition of 131 I-MIBG uptake by midazolam or dexmedetomidine this case series suggests that continuous infusions of either agent can provide effective sedation to allow safe administration of 131 I-MIBG to young patients,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2229, 70, 3574, 16, 1635, 95, 9, 1367, 137, 634, 1706, 3465, 2149, 6, 121, 367, 677, 21, 897, 114, 730, 75, 1314, 7764, 6, 1876, 1165, 2229, 70, 3574, 36, 9, 1169, 541, 7, 11, 159, 4, 26, 473, 988, 492, 491, 103, 1314, 12941, 15, 27485, 904, 9, 7764, 190, 2229, 70, 3574, 36, 29, 2868, 14, 1195, 6, 2551, 14, 1409, 825, 123, 159, 6760, 1, 7764, 9, 110, 2229, 70, 3574, 904, 2, 3, 654, 1, 4741, 5019, 22, 149, 22, 28245, 139, 385, 1724, 928, 1807, 1441, 348, 2, 50, 2229, 70, 3574, 36, 11, 275, 75, 3, 21260, 368, 46, 703, 11, 72, 8040, 59, 12941, 27485, 2, 182, 77, 28245, 904, 271, 1, 3, 233, 7, 357, 1314, 7764, 9, 2229, 70, 3574, 36, 648, 513, 1658, 7764, 5, 12941, 365, 513, 1658, 7764, 5, 27485, 104, 69, 14, 49, 60, 1095, 1551, 6, 1359, 1658, 7764, 5, 361, 3012, 2, 205, 44, 560, 2229, 70, 3574, 36, 7764, 10, 1228, 149, 421, 186, 1152, 176, 9, 27485, 904, 159, 6577, 2, 580, 16827, 110, 24, 2, 182, 271, 42, 232, 7, 5, 101, 21260, 703, 539, 2229, 70, 3574, 36, 137, 104, 69, 4, 3, 12941, 87, 2, 100, 4, 3, 27485, 87, 42, 340, 21260, 703, 50, 2229, 70, 3574, 36, 369, 1292, 340, 4, 3, 182, 87, 242, 21, 122, 44, 6262, 3, 2526, 1, 476, 297, 1, 2229, 70, 3574, 1135, 20, 12941, 15, 27485, 26, 473, 988, 844, 17, 1314, 3435, 1, 361, 420, 122, 377, 323, 7764, 6, 1700, 1165, 634, 1, 2229, 70, 3574, 6, 1169, 7]",1787.0,26585842,63
Lack of survival advantage with autologous stem-cell transplantation in high-risk neuroblastoma consolidated by anti-GD2 immunotherapy and isotretinoin.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2016-01-01,"Since 2003, high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NB) patients at our center received anti-GD2 antibody 3F8/GM-CSF + isotretinoin - but not myeloablative therapy with autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT). Post-ASCT patients referred from elsewhere also received 3F8/GM-CSF + isotretinoin. We therefore accrued a study population of two groups treated during the same period and whose consolidative therapy, aside from ASCT, was identical. We analyzed patients enrolled in 1st complete/very good partial remission (CR/VGPR). Their event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated from study entry. Large study size allowed robust statistical analyses of key prognosticators including MYCN amplification, minimal residual disease (MRD), FCGR2A polymorphisms, and killer immunoglobulin-like receptor genotypes of natural killer cells. The 170 study patients included 60 enrolled following ASCT and 110 following conventional chemotherapy. The two cohorts had similar clinical and biological features. Five-year rates for ASCT and non-ASCT patients were, respectively: EFS 65% vs. 51% (p = .128), and OS 76% vs. 75% (p = .975).

Salvage rates after progression of high-risk neuroblastoma with a soft tissue mass.,Journal of pediatric surgery,J. Pediatr. Surg.,2015-11-05,"Treatment of progression in high-risk neuroblastoma remains challenging despite improved survival. We retrospectively evaluated outcomes in children with a first progression that included soft-tissue masses. We reviewed records of 903 consecutive children with high-risk neuroblastoma diagnosed between 2004 and 2014, and identified 42 whose first progression included soft-tissue masses. Data on demographics, disease characteristics, treatment, and survival were collected. Primary outcome was 5-year overall survival (OS) from time of first progression. Secondary outcomes were local disease-free progression (LDFR) and progression-free survival (PFS) postprogression. We evaluated the prognostic significance of concomitant bone/bone marrow involvement, MYCN status, and multifocality of soft tissue relapse. Median age at diagnosis was 3.0 (range: 1-10.7) years. Median time to first relapse or progression was 1.2 (range: 0.1-4.5) years after complete remission or minimal stable residual disease. Twelve (29%) patients had concomitant bone or marrow involvement at progression/relapse. There were 11 (26%) patients with International Neuroblastoma Staging System stage 3 disease (all with MYCN amplification), and 31 (74%) with stage 4 disease (12 with MYCN amplification). Nine (21%) patients had multifocal soft tissue progression. R1 resection was achieved in 41 children (95%), 38 (95%) of whom also received salvage radiation therapy. Five-year OS postprogression was 35% (95% CI: 19-51%), 5-year LDFS was 52% (95% CI: 32-72%), and 5-year PFS postprogression was 20% (95% CI: 6-34%).

Fumarate and Succinate Regulate Expression of Hypoxia-inducible Genes via TET Enzymes.,The Journal of biological chemistry,J. Biol. Chem.,2015-12-23,"The TET enzymes are members of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family and comprise three isoenzymes in humans: TETs 1-3. These TETs convert 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) in DNA, and high 5-hmC levels are associated with active transcription. The importance of the balance in these modified cytosines is emphasized by the fact that TET2 is mutated in several human cancers, including myeloid malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We characterize here the kinetic and inhibitory properties of Tets and show that the Km value of Tets 1 and 2 for O2 is 30 μm, indicating that they retain high activity even under hypoxic conditions. The AML-associated mutations in the Fe(2+) and 2-oxoglutarate-binding residues increased the Km values for these factors 30-80-fold and reduced the Vmax values. Fumarate and succinate, which can accumulate to millimolar levels in succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate hydratase-mutant tumors, were identified as potent Tet inhibitors in vitro, with IC50 values ∼400-500 μm. Fumarate and succinate also down-regulated global 5-hmC levels in neuroblastoma cells and the expression levels of some hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) target genes via TET inhibition, despite simultaneous HIFα stabilization. The combination of fumarate or succinate treatment with TET1 or TET3 silencing caused differential effects on the expression of specific HIF target genes. Altogether these data show that hypoxia-inducible genes are regulated in a multilayered manner that includes epigenetic regulation via TETs and 5-hmC levels in addition to HIF stabilization.

Identification of patient subgroups with markedly disparate rates of MYCN amplification in neuroblastoma: A report from the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group project.,Cancer,Cancer,2015-12-28,"MYCN gene amplification (MNA) is a hallmark of aggressive neuroblastoma. This study was performed to determine univariate and multivariate predictors of tumor MNA. Data from the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group were analyzed for a subset of 7102 patients with known MYCN status. Chi-square testing and logistic regression were used to identify univariate and multivariate predictors of MYCN status. Recursive partitioning was used to identify groups of patients with maximal differences in rates of MNA. All clinical features (age ≥ 18 months, high ferritin levels, high lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] levels, International Neuroblastoma Staging System stage 4, and adrenal sites) and pathological/biological features (DNA index ≤ 1, high mitosis-karyorrhexis index [MKI], undifferentiated/poorly differentiated grade, unfavorable histology according to the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification, and segmental chromosomal aberrations [SCAs]) were significantly associated with MNA. LDH (odds ratio [OR], 8.4; P < .001) and chromosomal 1p loss of heterozygosity (OR, 19.8; P < .001) were the clinical and biological variables, respectively, most strongly associated with MNA. In logistic regression, all variables except chromosome 17q aberration and pooled SCAs were independently predictive of MNA.

Arsenic Trioxide as a Radiation Sensitizer for 131I-Metaiodobenzylguanidine Therapy: Results of a Phase II Study.,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",J. Nucl. Med.,2016-01-07,"Arsenic trioxide has in vitro and in vivo radiosensitizing properties. We hypothesized that arsenic trioxide would enhance the efficacy of the targeted radiotherapeutic agent (131)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine ((131)I-MIBG) and tested the combination in a phase II clinical trial. Patients with recurrent or refractory stage 4 neuroblastoma or metastatic paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma (MP) were treated using an institutional review board-approved protocol (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00107289). The planned treatment was (131)I-MIBG (444 or 666 MBq/kg) intravenously on day 1 plus arsenic trioxide (0.15 or 0.25 mg/m(2)) intravenously on days 6-10 and 13-17. Toxicity was evaluated using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 3.0. Response was assessed by International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria or (for MP) by changes in (123)I-MIBG or PET scans. Twenty-one patients were treated: 19 with neuroblastoma and 2 with MP. Fourteen patients received (131)I-MIBG and arsenic trioxide, both at maximal dosages; 2 patients received a 444 MBq/kg dose of (131)I-MIBG plus a 0.15 mg/kg dose of arsenic trioxide; and 3 patients received a 666 MBq/kg dose of (131)I-MIBG plus a 0.15 mg/kg dose of arsenic trioxide. One did not receive arsenic trioxide because of transient central line-induced cardiac arrhythmia, and another received only 6 of 10 planned doses of arsenic trioxide because of grade 3 diarrhea and vomiting with concurrent grade 3 hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Nineteen patients experienced myelosuppression higher than grade 2, most frequently thrombocytopenia (n = 18), though none required autologous stem cell rescue. Twelve of 13 evaluable patients experienced hyperamylasemia higher than grade 2 from transient sialoadenitis. By International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria, 12 neuroblastoma patients had no response and 7 had progressive disease, including 6 of 8 entering the study with progressive disease. Objective improvements in semiquantitative (131)I-MIBG scores were observed in 6 patients. No response was seen in MP. Seventeen of 19 neuroblastoma patients continued on further chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Mean 5-year overall survival (±SD) for neuroblastoma was 37% ± 11%. Mean absorbed dose of (131)I-MIBG to blood was 0.134 cGy/MBq, well below myeloablative levels in all patients. (131)I-MIBG plus arsenic trioxide was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of (131)I-MIBG therapy alone. The addition of arsenic trioxide to (131)I-MIBG did not significantly improve response rates when compared with historical data with (131)I-MIBG alone.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",1475.0,5.0,Arsenic trioxide has in vitro and in vivo radiosensitizing properties We hypothesized that arsenic trioxide would enhance the efficacy of the targeted radiotherapeutic agent 131 I-metaiodobenzylguanidine 131 I-MIBG and tested the combination in a phase II clinical trial Patients with recurrent or refractory stage 4 or metastatic paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma MP were treated using an institutional review board-approved protocol Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00107289 The planned treatment was 131 I-MIBG 444 or 666 MBq/kg intravenously on day 1 plus arsenic trioxide 0.15 or 0.25 mg/m 2 intravenously on days 6-10 and 13-17 Toxicity was evaluated using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0 Response was assessed by International Response Criteria or for MP by changes in 123 I-MIBG or PET scans Twenty-one patients were treated 19 with and 2 with MP Fourteen patients received 131 I-MIBG and arsenic trioxide both at maximal dosages 2 patients received a 444 MBq/kg dose of 131 I-MIBG plus a 0.15 mg/kg dose of arsenic trioxide and 3 patients received a 666 MBq/kg dose of 131 I-MIBG plus a 0.15 mg/kg dose of arsenic trioxide One did not receive arsenic trioxide because of transient central line-induced arrhythmia and another received only 6 of 10 planned doses of arsenic trioxide because of grade 3 diarrhea and vomiting with concurrent grade 3 hypokalemia and hyponatremia Nineteen patients experienced myelosuppression higher than grade 2 most frequently thrombocytopenia n 18 though none required autologous stem cell rescue Twelve of 13 evaluable patients experienced hyperamylasemia higher than grade 2 from transient sialoadenitis By International Response Criteria 12 patients had no response and 7 had progressive disease including 6 of 8 entering the study with progressive disease Objective improvements in semiquantitative 131 I-MIBG scores were observed in 6 patients No response was seen in MP Seventeen of 19 patients continued on further chemotherapy or immunotherapy Mean 5-year overall survival ±SD for was 37 ± 11 Mean absorbed dose of 131 I-MIBG to blood was 0.134 cGy/MBq well below myeloablative levels in all patients 131 I-MIBG plus arsenic trioxide was well tolerated with an adverse event profile similar to that of 131 I-MIBG therapy alone The addition of arsenic trioxide to 131 I-MIBG did not significantly improve response rates when compared with historical data with 131 I-MIBG alone,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"[3217, 4574, 71, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 8384, 1571, 21, 1237, 17, 3217, 4574, 688, 1304, 3, 209, 1, 3, 238, 11924, 420, 2229, 70, 11285, 2229, 70, 3574, 2, 650, 3, 150, 4, 8, 124, 215, 38, 160, 7, 5, 387, 15, 430, 82, 39, 15, 113, 6827, 12594, 4545, 11, 73, 75, 35, 1115, 206, 2620, 850, 1182, 1252, 1239, 3719, 67452, 3, 1465, 24, 10, 2229, 70, 3574, 10325, 15, 14490, 5372, 503, 1672, 23, 218, 14, 349, 3217, 4574, 13, 167, 15, 13, 243, 81, 188, 18, 1672, 23, 162, 49, 79, 2, 233, 269, 155, 10, 194, 75, 657, 12, 1377, 186, 155, 371, 2256, 27, 13, 51, 10, 275, 20, 944, 51, 371, 15, 9, 4545, 20, 400, 4, 2698, 70, 3574, 15, 495, 1441, 737, 104, 7, 11, 73, 326, 5, 2, 18, 5, 4545, 3225, 7, 103, 2229, 70, 3574, 2, 3217, 4574, 110, 28, 2725, 7352, 18, 7, 103, 8, 10325, 5372, 503, 61, 1, 2229, 70, 3574, 349, 8, 13, 167, 81, 503, 61, 1, 3217, 4574, 2, 27, 7, 103, 8, 14490, 5372, 503, 61, 1, 2229, 70, 3574, 349, 8, 13, 167, 81, 503, 61, 1, 3217, 4574, 104, 205, 44, 560, 3217, 4574, 408, 1, 2473, 854, 328, 277, 12103, 2, 1809, 103, 158, 49, 1, 79, 1465, 415, 1, 3217, 4574, 408, 1, 88, 27, 1172, 2, 1966, 5, 750, 88, 27, 7799, 2, 6672, 3498, 7, 592, 2858, 142, 76, 88, 18, 96, 746, 1340, 78, 203, 2471, 1292, 616, 1028, 452, 31, 4256, 2544, 1, 233, 859, 7, 592, 67453, 142, 76, 88, 18, 29, 2473, 44918, 20, 944, 51, 371, 133, 7, 42, 77, 51, 2, 67, 42, 1014, 34, 141, 49, 1, 66, 7653, 3, 45, 5, 1014, 34, 461, 1474, 4, 8942, 2229, 70, 3574, 703, 11, 164, 4, 49, 7, 77, 51, 10, 527, 4, 4545, 3591, 1, 326, 7, 1351, 23, 195, 56, 15, 726, 313, 33, 111, 63, 25, 22658, 9, 10, 567, 810, 175, 313, 5249, 61, 1, 2229, 70, 3574, 6, 315, 10, 13, 4842, 3071, 5372, 149, 2736, 3246, 148, 4, 62, 7, 2229, 70, 3574, 349, 3217, 4574, 10, 149, 421, 5, 35, 290, 774, 800, 288, 6, 17, 1, 2229, 70, 3574, 36, 279, 3, 352, 1, 3217, 4574, 6, 2229, 70, 3574, 205, 44, 97, 401, 51, 151, 198, 72, 5, 2252, 74, 5, 2229, 70, 3574, 279]",2452.0,26742708,259
Physician Perspectives on Palliative Care for Children With Neuroblastoma: An International Context.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2016-01-19,"Studies have shown that children with cancer globally lack access to palliative care. Little is known regarding physicians' perceptions of palliative care, treatment access, and self-reported competence in providing palliative care. Members of the Global Neuroblastoma Network (online tumor board) were surveyed. Eighty-three respondents met inclusion criteria; 53 (64%) completed the survey. Most respondents trained in high-income countries (HIC) but practice in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), and care for more than five patients with neuroblastoma annually. WHO Essential Medicines in palliative care varied in availability, with incomplete access across LMIC centers. Nonpharmacologic therapies were inconsistently available. Contrary to international definitions, 17% of respondents inappropriately considered palliative care as that initiated only after curative therapy is stopped. Mean physician competence composite score (Likert scale 1-5, 5 = very competent) in providing symptomatic relief and palliative care across phases of care was 2.93 (95% CI 2.71-3.22). Physicians reported significantly greater competence in symptom management during cure-directed therapy than during end-of-life (P = 0.02) or when patients are actively dying (P = 0.007). Practicing in HIC, prior palliative care training, having access to radiotherapy, and not having to turn patients away due to bed shortages were significantly predictive of perceived competence in providing palliative care at end of life. An international sample identified gaps in treatment and palliative care service availability, in understanding the definition of palliative care, and in self-reported competence in providing palliative care. Increased perceived competence was associated with training, which supports the need for increased palliative care education and advocacy, especially in LMIC.",Journal Article,1463.0,2.0,Studies have shown that children with cancer globally lack access to palliative care Little is known regarding physicians perceptions of palliative care treatment access and self-reported competence in providing palliative care Members of the Global Network online tumor board were surveyed Eighty-three respondents met inclusion criteria 53 64 completed the survey Most respondents trained in high-income countries HIC but practice in low- and middle-income countries LMIC and care for more than five patients with annually WHO Essential Medicines in palliative care varied in availability with incomplete access across LMIC centers Nonpharmacologic therapies were inconsistently available Contrary to international definitions 17 of respondents inappropriately considered palliative care as that initiated only after curative therapy is stopped Mean physician competence composite score Likert scale 1-5 5 very competent in providing symptomatic relief and palliative care across phases of care was 2.93 95 CI 2.71-3.22 Physicians reported significantly greater competence in symptom management during cure-directed therapy than during end-of-life P 0.02 or when patients are actively dying P 0.007 Practicing in HIC prior palliative care training having access to radiotherapy and not having to turn patients away due to bed shortages were significantly predictive of perceived competence in providing palliative care at end of life An international sample identified gaps in treatment and palliative care service availability in understanding the definition of palliative care and in self-reported competence in providing palliative care Increased perceived competence was associated with training which supports the need for increased palliative care education and advocacy especially in LMIC,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[94, 47, 443, 17, 541, 5, 12, 6873, 926, 1655, 6, 994, 165, 1215, 16, 440, 666, 1261, 3746, 1, 994, 165, 24, 1655, 2, 1074, 210, 11573, 4, 1736, 994, 165, 1684, 1, 3, 1648, 1801, 4123, 30, 2620, 11, 3696, 2207, 169, 3122, 543, 1680, 371, 699, 660, 781, 3, 1407, 96, 3122, 5946, 4, 64, 2306, 2115, 13390, 84, 758, 4, 154, 2, 3897, 2306, 2115, 12950, 2, 165, 9, 80, 76, 365, 7, 5, 4226, 54, 1452, 11478, 4, 994, 165, 2051, 4, 2550, 5, 2610, 1655, 716, 12950, 1168, 11803, 235, 11, 12399, 390, 7194, 6, 944, 3833, 269, 1, 3122, 13254, 515, 994, 165, 22, 17, 1917, 158, 50, 1075, 36, 16, 4403, 313, 1473, 11573, 3308, 368, 13181, 1124, 14, 33, 33, 923, 6299, 4, 1736, 1704, 4586, 2, 994, 165, 716, 3523, 1, 165, 10, 18, 966, 48, 58, 18, 792, 27, 350, 1261, 210, 97, 378, 11573, 4, 934, 284, 190, 1722, 1166, 36, 76, 190, 396, 1, 358, 19, 13, 588, 15, 198, 7, 32, 4489, 4536, 19, 13, 1999, 6734, 4, 13390, 324, 994, 165, 1741, 1041, 1655, 6, 310, 2, 44, 1041, 6, 3854, 7, 6565, 520, 6, 2929, 12866, 11, 97, 464, 1, 2588, 11573, 4, 1736, 994, 165, 28, 396, 1, 358, 35, 944, 1000, 108, 5287, 4, 24, 2, 994, 165, 3086, 2550, 4, 612, 3, 2470, 1, 994, 165, 2, 4, 1074, 210, 11573, 4, 1736, 994, 165, 101, 2588, 11573, 10, 41, 5, 1741, 92, 2304, 3, 594, 9, 101, 994, 165, 1848, 2, 8368, 1093, 4, 12950]",1797.0,26784890,6
GNA11 Mutation in a Patient With Cutaneous Origin Melanoma: A Case Report.,Medicine,Medicine (Baltimore),2016-01-01,"The rapid advances in the molecular biology and genetics have improved the understanding of molecular pathogenesis of v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF), feline sarcoma viral oncogene v-kit (KIT), and neuroblastoma v-Ras oncogene homolog (NRAS) mutant melanomas with the subsequent development of targeted therapeutic agents. However, only limited data are available for melanoma harboring other somatic than BRAF, KIT, and NRAS mutations. Mutations in guanine nucleotide-binding protein Q polypeptide (GNAQ) and guanine nucleotide-binding protein alpha-11 (GNA11), alpha subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, constitutively activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in uveal melanoma.

Promoter Methylation of PTEN Is a Significant Prognostic Factor in Melanoma Survival.,The Journal of investigative dermatology,J. Invest. Dermatol.,2016-02-15,"Structural compromise of the tumor suppressor gene, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), occurs in 10% of melanoma specimens, and loss of PTEN expression through DNA methylation of the PTEN promoter region has also been reported in a number of other malignancies. However, the role of PTEN promoter methylation in melanoma is not well understood. We thus sought to elucidate the prevalence of PTEN promoter methylation in melanoma specimens, its relationship to clinical features, and its impact on the outcome of patients with melanoma. PTEN promoter methylation data were acquired from an archived primary Korean melanoma cohort (KMC) of 158 patients and, for validation, 234 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas melanoma (TCGA-MEL) cohort. Hierarchical clustering was performed to identify PTEN ""high methylated"" and ""low methylated"" samples. Subsequently, differences in clinical features and outcomes based on PTEN promoter methylation status were then analyzed using SPSS and R. In the KMC, all tumors were acquired from primary tumors and 65.7% (n = 105) were acral or mucosal by site, whereas in the TCGA-MEL cohort, 90.5% of the tumors were from regional lymph node and distant metastatic lesions. Overall, 17.7% and 45.7% of the specimens harbored BRAF mutations in the KMC and TCGA-MEL cohort, respectively. Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog was mutated in 12.2% and 26.9% of the tumors in the KMC and TCGA-MEL cohort, respectively. In the KMC, 31 cases (19.6%) were included in the high methylated group versus 142 cases (60.7%) in the TCGA-MEL cohort (P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox-regression analysis revealed promoter methylation of PTEN to be an independent negative prognostic factor for survival in both the KMC (hazard ratio 3.76, 95% confidence interval = 1.24-11.12, P = 0.017) and TCGA-MEL cohort (HR 1.88, 95% confidence interval = 1.13-3.12, P = 0.015).

Phase I Study of the Aurora A Kinase Inhibitor Alisertib in Combination With Irinotecan and Temozolomide for Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Neuroblastoma: A NANT (New Approaches to Neuroblastoma Therapy) Trial.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-02-16,"Alisertib is an oral Aurora A kinase inhibitor with preclinical activity in neuroblastoma. Irinotecan and temozolomide have activity in patients with advanced neuroblastoma. The goal of this phase I study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of alisertib with irinotecan and temozolomide in this population. Patients age 1 to 30 years with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma were eligible. Patients received alisertib tablets at dose levels of 45, 60, and 80 mg/m(2) per day on days 1 to 7 along with irinotecan 50 mg/m(2) intravenously and temozolomide 100 mg/m(2) orally on days 1 to 5. Dose escalation of alisertib followed the rolling six design. Samples for pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic testing were obtained. Twenty-three patients enrolled, and 22 were eligible and evaluable for dose escalation. A total of 244 courses were administered. The MTD for alisertib was 60 mg/m(2), with mandatory myeloid growth factor support and cephalosporin prophylaxis for diarrhea. Thrombocytopenia and neutropenia of any grade were seen in the majority of courses (84% and 69%, respectively). Diarrhea in 55% of courses and nausea in 54% of courses were the most common nonhematologic toxicities. The overall response rate was 31.8%, with a 50% response rate observed at the MTD. The median number of courses per patient was eight (range, two to 32). Progression-free survival rate at 2 years was 52.4%. Pharmacokinetic testing did not show evidence of drug-drug interaction between irinotecan and alisertib. Alisertib 60 mg/m(2) per dose for 7 days is tolerable with a standard irinotecan and temozolomide backbone and has promising response and progression-free survival rates. A phase II trial of this regimen is ongoing.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",1435.0,46.0,Alisertib is an oral Aurora A kinase inhibitor with preclinical activity in Irinotecan and temozolomide have activity in patients with advanced The goal of this phase I study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose MTD of alisertib with irinotecan and temozolomide in this population Patients age 1 to 30 years with relapsed or refractory were eligible Patients received alisertib tablets at dose levels of 45 60 and 80 mg/m 2 per day on days 1 to 7 along with irinotecan 50 mg/m 2 intravenously and temozolomide 100 mg/m 2 orally on days 1 to 5 Dose escalation of alisertib followed the rolling six design Samples for pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic testing were obtained Twenty-three patients enrolled and 22 were eligible and evaluable for dose escalation A total of 244 courses were administered The MTD for alisertib was 60 mg/m 2 with mandatory myeloid growth factor support and cephalosporin prophylaxis for diarrhea Thrombocytopenia and neutropenia of any grade were seen in the majority of courses 84 and 69 respectively Diarrhea in 55 of courses and nausea in 54 of courses were the most common nonhematologic toxicities The overall response rate was 31.8 with a 50 response rate observed at the MTD The median number of courses per patient was eight range two to 32 Progression-free survival rate at 2 years was 52.4 Pharmacokinetic testing did not show evidence of drug-drug interaction between irinotecan and alisertib Alisertib 60 mg/m 2 per dose for 7 days is tolerable with a standard irinotecan and temozolomide backbone and has promising response and progression-free survival rates A phase II trial of this regimen is ongoing,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6991, 16, 35, 518, 4095, 8, 216, 230, 5, 693, 128, 4, 1071, 2, 1537, 47, 128, 4, 7, 5, 131, 3, 1326, 1, 26, 124, 70, 45, 10, 6, 223, 3, 689, 421, 61, 961, 1, 6991, 5, 1071, 2, 1537, 4, 26, 266, 7, 89, 14, 6, 201, 60, 5, 591, 15, 430, 11, 625, 7, 103, 6991, 6675, 28, 61, 148, 1, 512, 335, 2, 493, 81, 188, 18, 379, 218, 23, 162, 14, 6, 67, 1510, 5, 1071, 212, 81, 188, 18, 1672, 2, 1537, 394, 81, 188, 18, 1428, 23, 162, 14, 6, 33, 61, 1125, 1, 6991, 370, 3, 15220, 437, 771, 347, 9, 1456, 2, 6971, 471, 11, 683, 737, 169, 7, 346, 2, 350, 11, 625, 2, 859, 9, 61, 1125, 8, 181, 1, 6567, 1993, 11, 468, 3, 961, 9, 6991, 10, 335, 81, 188, 18, 5, 7322, 533, 129, 161, 538, 2, 19153, 2049, 9, 1172, 1340, 2, 778, 1, 500, 88, 11, 527, 4, 3, 686, 1, 1993, 874, 2, 790, 106, 1172, 4, 614, 1, 1993, 2, 1218, 4, 667, 1, 1993, 11, 3, 96, 186, 3534, 385, 3, 63, 51, 116, 10, 456, 66, 5, 8, 212, 51, 116, 164, 28, 3, 961, 3, 52, 207, 1, 1993, 379, 69, 10, 659, 184, 100, 6, 531, 91, 115, 25, 116, 28, 18, 60, 10, 653, 39, 1456, 471, 205, 44, 514, 241, 1, 234, 234, 915, 59, 1071, 2, 6991, 6991, 335, 81, 188, 18, 379, 61, 9, 67, 162, 16, 2668, 5, 8, 260, 1071, 2, 1537, 7066, 2, 71, 721, 51, 2, 91, 115, 25, 151, 8, 124, 215, 160, 1, 26, 477, 16, 942]",1652.0,26884555,141
"First-in-human, open-label dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of the safety, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor effects of an oral ALK inhibitor ASP3026 in patients with advanced solid tumors.",Journal of hematology & oncology,J Hematol Oncol,2016-03-10,"ASP3026 is a second-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor that has potent in vitro activity against crizotinib-resistant ALK-positive tumors. This open-label, multicenter, first-in-human phase I study ( NCT01284192 ) assessed the safety, pharmacokinetic profile, and antitumor activity of ASP3026. Advanced solid tumor patients received oral ASP3026 in 3 + 3 dose-escalation cohorts at doses of 25-800 mg once daily in 28-day cycles. The endpoints were to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the recommended phase II dose (RP2D), and the pharmacokinetic profile of ASP3026. A phase Ib expansion cohort enrolled patients with metastatic, crizotinib-resistant ALK-positive solid tumors at the RP2D, and response was evaluated by RECIST 1.1. The dose-escalation cohort enrolled 33 patients, including three crizotinib-resistant, ALK-positive patients, and the dose-expansion cohort enrolled another 13 crizotinib-resistant, ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. ASP3026 demonstrated both linear pharmacokinetics and dose-proportional exposure for area under the plasma concentration-time curve and maximum concentration observed with a median terminal half-life of 35 h, supporting the daily dosing. Grade 3 rash and elevated transaminase concentrations were dose-limiting toxicities observed at 800 mg; hence, 525 mg daily was the MTD and RP2D. The most common treatment-related adverse events were nausea (38%), fatigue (35%), and vomiting (35 %).

An Activating KIT Mutation Induces Crizotinib Resistance in ROS1-Positive Lung Cancer.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2016-04-09,"Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring ROS proto-oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ROS1) chromosomal rearrangements benefit from treatment with the ROS1 inhibitor crizotinib. Limited data exist on the spectrum of resistance mechanisms in ROS1-positive NSCLC. To delineate mechanisms of acquired resistance, we analyzed biopsy samples of tumor lesions that progressed while patients were receiving crizotinib. An activating mutation in the KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT) (p.D816G) was identified by SNaPshot sequencing in a tumor sample from a patient with ROS1-positive NSCLC identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization whose disease progressed after initial response to crizotinib. In vitro studies included evaluation of KIT mRNA expression by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reactions, transduction of Ba/F3 cells and NSCLC cell lines with KIT-expressing lentiviral plasmids, immunoblotting, and cellular proliferation assays. KIT(D816G) is an activating mutation that induces autophosphorylation and cell proliferation. Expression of the mutant KIT(D816G) receptor in ROS1-positive NSCLC cell lines led to constitutively activated KIT as measured by phosphorylation of the KIT receptor. Expression of the KIT(D816G) rendered the HCC78 and CUTO2 cell lines resistant to crizotinib, and only dual inhibition of ROS1 and KIT with crizotinib and ponatinib could resensitize the cells to inhibition of proliferation. The oncogenic switch observed in ROS1-positive cell lines was not immediate and required pharmacologic inactivation of ROS1. Activation of KIT by a gain-of-function somatic mutation is a novel mechanism of resistance to crizotinib in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC. This bypass signaling pathway serves as a ROS1-independent mechanism of resistance, similarly to previously identified epidermal growth factor receptor or Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog/neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog signaling pathways, and can potentially be targeted by KIT inhibitors.",Case Reports,1382.0,31.0,Patients with cell cancer NSCLC harboring ROS proto-oncogene 1 receptor tyrosine kinase gene ROS1 chromosomal rearrangements benefit from treatment with the ROS1 inhibitor crizotinib Limited data exist on the spectrum of resistance mechanisms in ROS1-positive NSCLC To delineate mechanisms of acquired resistance we analyzed biopsy samples of tumor lesions that progressed while patients were receiving crizotinib An activating mutation in the KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase KIT p.D816G was identified by SNaPshot sequencing in a tumor sample from a patient with ROS1-positive NSCLC identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization whose disease progressed after initial response to crizotinib In vitro studies included evaluation of KIT mRNA expression by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reactions transduction of Ba/F3 cells and NSCLC cell lines with KIT-expressing lentiviral plasmids immunoblotting and cellular proliferation assays KIT D816G is an activating mutation that induces autophosphorylation and cell proliferation Expression of the mutant KIT D816G receptor in ROS1-positive NSCLC cell lines led to constitutively activated KIT as measured by phosphorylation of the KIT receptor Expression of the KIT D816G rendered the HCC78 and CUTO2 cell lines resistant to crizotinib and only dual inhibition of ROS1 and KIT with crizotinib and ponatinib could resensitize the cells to inhibition of proliferation The oncogenic switch observed in ROS1-positive cell lines was not immediate and required pharmacologic inactivation of ROS1 Activation of KIT by a gain-of-function somatic mutation is a novel mechanism of resistance to crizotinib in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC This bypass signaling pathway serves as a ROS1-independent mechanism of resistance similarly to previously identified epidermal growth factor receptor or Kirsten rat viral oncogene homolog/neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog signaling pathways and can potentially be targeted by KIT inhibitors,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[7, 5, 31, 12, 304, 2105, 2609, 4976, 1836, 14, 153, 564, 216, 145, 3581, 1860, 2072, 247, 29, 24, 5, 3, 3581, 230, 2284, 383, 74, 1923, 23, 3, 1873, 1, 251, 483, 4, 3581, 109, 304, 6, 5092, 483, 1, 1294, 251, 21, 311, 411, 347, 1, 30, 406, 17, 1839, 369, 7, 11, 357, 2284, 35, 1616, 258, 4, 3, 1164, 4976, 1836, 153, 564, 216, 1164, 19, 36220, 10, 108, 20, 12664, 615, 4, 8, 30, 1000, 29, 8, 69, 5, 3581, 109, 304, 108, 20, 1591, 4, 957, 1554, 1310, 34, 1839, 50, 388, 51, 6, 2284, 4, 439, 94, 159, 451, 1, 1164, 956, 55, 20, 1156, 1772, 4456, 1451, 1260, 2428, 2761, 1, 6669, 6904, 37, 2, 304, 31, 285, 5, 1164, 1046, 7823, 12473, 5293, 2, 763, 457, 1013, 1164, 36220, 16, 35, 1616, 258, 17, 1516, 8146, 2, 31, 457, 55, 1, 3, 620, 1164, 36220, 153, 4, 3581, 109, 304, 31, 285, 836, 6, 2818, 735, 1164, 22, 644, 20, 982, 1, 3, 1164, 153, 55, 1, 3, 1164, 36220, 6021, 3, 27127, 2, 67969, 31, 285, 436, 6, 2284, 2, 158, 1828, 297, 1, 3581, 2, 1164, 5, 2284, 2, 5715, 359, 21008, 3, 37, 6, 297, 1, 457, 3, 1302, 5096, 164, 4, 3581, 109, 31, 285, 10, 44, 2181, 2, 616, 2788, 2297, 1, 3581, 363, 1, 1164, 20, 8, 1803, 1, 343, 1119, 258, 16, 8, 229, 670, 1, 251, 6, 2284, 4, 3581, 3201, 304, 26, 5481, 314, 308, 4711, 22, 8, 3581, 306, 670, 1, 251, 1813, 6, 373, 108, 829, 129, 161, 153, 15, 10618, 4008, 1667, 1836, 3412, 28094, 1102, 1667, 1836, 3412, 314, 460, 2, 122, 751, 40, 238, 20, 1164, 222]",2002.0,27068398,187
KIR3DL1 Allelic Polymorphism and HLA-B Epitopes Modulate Response to Anti-GD2 Monoclonal Antibody in Patients With Neuroblastoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-04-11,"In patients with neuroblastoma (NB), treatment with anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directs natural killer (NK) cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against tumor cells. However, tumor cytotoxicity is attenuated by ligation of inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) by HLA class I molecules. KIR3DL1 polymorphism influences its ability to engage HLA-Bw4 ligands. We tested the hypothesis that poorly interacting combinations of KIR3DL1 and HLA ligands are more permissive of mAb-mediated antitumor effect. KIR3DL1 and HLA-B subtyping were performed with a multiplex intermediate-resolution polymerase chain reaction assay for a cohort of 245 patients who were treated with antibody 3F8 for high-risk NB. Patient outcomes were analyzed according to expected degree of interaction between KIR3DL1 and HLA-B subtypes and grouped as strong, weak, or noninteractors. A comparison of NK response to 3F8 mAb opsonized NB cells between strong- and noninteracting donors was performed by flow cytometry. KIR3DL1 and HLA-B subtype combinations associated with noninteraction as a result of lack of receptor expression [KIR3DL1(-)], failure of interaction with inhibitory ligands [KIR3DS1(+)], or absence of KIR ligands resulted in significantly improved overall and progression-free survival. Patients with KIR3DL1 and HLA-B subtype combinations that were predictive of weak interaction had superior outcomes compared with those that were predictive of strong interaction; however, both groups were inferior to those with noninteracting subtype combinations. In vitro analysis of 3F8-mediated ADCC showed that KIR3DL1(-) and 3DS1(+) NK cells were insensitive to inhibition by HLA-Bw4-expressing NB targets. We conclude that KIR3LD1 and HLA-B allele combinations can have a prognostic impact on patient survival after treatment with anti-GD2 mAb that relies on NK-ADCC. The survival advantage seen in noninteracting combinations supports the therapeutic disinhibition of individuals with strongly interacting KIR and ligand pairs.",Journal Article,1380.0,30.0,In patients with NB treatment with anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody mAb directs natural killer NK cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC against tumor cells However tumor cytotoxicity is attenuated by ligation of inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptors KIRs by HLA class I molecules KIR3DL1 polymorphism influences its ability to engage HLA-Bw4 ligands We tested the hypothesis that poorly interacting combinations of KIR3DL1 and HLA ligands are more permissive of mAb-mediated antitumor effect KIR3DL1 and HLA-B subtyping were performed with a multiplex intermediate-resolution polymerase chain reaction assay for a cohort of 245 patients who were treated with antibody 3F8 for high-risk NB Patient outcomes were analyzed according to expected degree of interaction between KIR3DL1 and HLA-B subtypes and grouped as strong weak or noninteractors A comparison of NK response to 3F8 mAb opsonized NB cells between strong- and noninteracting donors was performed by flow cytometry KIR3DL1 and HLA-B subtype combinations associated with noninteraction as a result of lack of receptor expression KIR3DL1 failure of interaction with inhibitory ligands KIR3DS1 or absence of KIR ligands resulted in significantly improved overall and progression-free survival Patients with KIR3DL1 and HLA-B subtype combinations that were predictive of weak interaction had superior outcomes compared with those that were predictive of strong interaction however both groups were inferior to those with noninteracting subtype combinations In vitro analysis of 3F8-mediated ADCC showed that KIR3DL1 and 3DS1 NK cells were insensitive to inhibition by HLA-Bw4-expressing NB targets We conclude that KIR3LD1 and HLA-B allele combinations can have a prognostic impact on patient survival after treatment with anti-GD2 mAb that relies on NK-ADCC The survival advantage seen in noninteracting combinations supports the therapeutic disinhibition of individuals with strongly interacting KIR and ligand pairs,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4, 7, 5, 3446, 24, 5, 312, 4758, 848, 548, 2780, 18224, 1504, 3458, 1765, 31, 517, 548, 470, 763, 1408, 5551, 480, 30, 37, 137, 30, 1408, 16, 2656, 20, 5307, 1, 1810, 3458, 2593, 733, 1186, 24000, 20, 1160, 1040, 70, 1598, 25755, 1907, 3859, 211, 801, 6, 7430, 1160, 41315, 3123, 21, 650, 3, 1492, 17, 1240, 5505, 1247, 1, 25755, 2, 1160, 3123, 32, 80, 11080, 1, 2780, 517, 579, 254, 25755, 2, 1160, 132, 7064, 11, 173, 5, 8, 4908, 919, 2125, 1451, 1260, 1329, 719, 9, 8, 180, 1, 7373, 7, 54, 11, 73, 5, 548, 5970, 9, 64, 43, 3446, 69, 123, 11, 311, 768, 6, 1336, 1444, 1, 915, 59, 25755, 2, 1160, 132, 814, 2, 3706, 22, 1082, 4241, 15, 67971, 8, 1155, 1, 1765, 51, 6, 5970, 2780, 22192, 3446, 37, 59, 1082, 2, 41395, 2344, 10, 173, 20, 1412, 1914, 25755, 2, 1160, 132, 875, 1247, 41, 5, 67972, 22, 8, 757, 1, 926, 1, 153, 55, 25755, 496, 1, 915, 5, 1810, 3123, 67973, 15, 1127, 1, 6989, 3123, 627, 4, 97, 231, 63, 2, 91, 115, 25, 7, 5, 25755, 2, 1160, 132, 875, 1247, 17, 11, 464, 1, 4241, 915, 42, 1123, 123, 72, 5, 135, 17, 11, 464, 1, 1082, 915, 137, 110, 271, 11, 1663, 6, 135, 5, 41395, 875, 1247, 4, 439, 65, 1, 5970, 517, 5551, 224, 17, 25755, 2, 67974, 1765, 37, 11, 7422, 6, 297, 20, 1160, 41315, 1046, 3446, 637, 21, 2060, 17, 67975, 2, 1160, 132, 1254, 1247, 122, 47, 8, 177, 345, 23, 69, 25, 50, 24, 5, 312, 4758, 2780, 17, 6495, 23, 1765, 5551, 3, 25, 1874, 527, 4, 41395, 1247, 2304, 3, 189, 36163, 1, 869, 5, 1327, 5505, 6989, 2, 1232, 2773]",2003.0,27069083,160
Integrating Genomics Into Clinical Pediatric Oncology Using the Molecular Tumor Board at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2016-04-15,"Pediatric oncologists have begun to leverage tumor genetic profiling to match patients with targeted therapies. At the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), we developed the Pediatric Molecular Tumor Board (PMTB) to track, integrate, and interpret clinical genomic profiling and potential targeted therapeutic recommendations. This retrospective case series includes all patients reviewed by the MSKCC PMTB from July 2014 to June 2015. Cases were submitted by treating oncologists and potential treatment recommendations were based upon the modified guidelines of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. There were 41 presentations of 39 individual patients during the study period. Gliomas, acute myeloid leukemia, and neuroblastoma were the most commonly reviewed cases. Thirty nine (87%) of the 45 molecular sequencing profiles utilized hybrid-capture targeted genome sequencing. In 30 (73%) of the 41 presentations, the PMTB provided therapeutic recommendations, of which 19 (46%) were implemented. Twenty-one (70%) of the recommendations involved targeted therapies. Three (14%) targeted therapy recommendations had published evidence to support the proposed recommendations (evidence levels 1-2), eight (36%) recommendations had preclinical evidence (level 3), and 11 (50%) recommendations were based upon hypothetical biological rationales (level 4).

Histiocytic neoplasms in the era of personalized genomic medicine.,Current opinion in hematology,Curr. Opin. Hematol.,2016-07-01,"Since the discovery of B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) V600E mutations in histiocytic neoplasms, diverse kinase alterations have been uncovered in BRAF V600E-wildtype histiocytoses. The purpose of this review is to outline recent molecular advances in histiocytic neoplasms and discuss their impact on the pathogenesis and treatment of these disorders. Activating kinase alterations discovered in BRAF V600E-wildtype Langerhans (LCH) and non-Langerhans cell histiocytoses (non-LCH) result in constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and/or phosphoinositide 3-kinases-Akt murine thymoma pathways. These kinase alterations include activating mutations in A-Raf proto-oncogene, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1, neuroblastoma rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3 kinase, catalytic subunit α kinases in LCH and non-LCH; BRAF, anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase, and neurotrophic tyrosine kinase, receptor type 1 fusions, as well as the Ets variant 3-nuclear receptor coactivator 2 fusion in non-LCH; and mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 and Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog kinases in LCH and histiocytic sarcoma, respectively. These discoveries have refined the understanding of the histiocytoses as clonal, myeloid neoplasms driven by constitutive mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and identified molecular therapeutic targets with promising clinical responses to rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibition. Genomic analyses over the last 6 years have identified targetable kinase alterations in BRAF V600E-wildtype histiocytic neoplasms.

GD2-specific antibody is currently a standard of care for high-risk neuroblastoma therapy. In this study, the pattern of GD2 and GD3 expression among pediatric/adolescent or young adult tumors was determined, providing companion diagnostics for targeted therapy. Ninety-two specimens of human osteosarcoma (OS), rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), Ewing family of tumors, desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), and melanoma were analyzed for GD2/GD3 expression by immunohistochemistry. Murine monoclonal antibody 3F8 was used for GD2 staining, and R24 for GD3. Staining was scored according to both intensity and percentage of positive tumor cells from 0 to 4. Both gangliosides were highly prevalent in OS and melanoma. Among other tumors, GD3 expression was higher than GD2 expression. Most OS samples demonstrated strong staining for GD2 and GD3, whereas expression for other tumors was highly variable. Mean intensity of GD2 expression was significantly more heterogeneous (P < 0.001) when compared to GD3 across tumor types. When assessing the difference between GD2 and GD3 expression in all tumor types combined, GD3 expression had a significantly higher score (P = 0.049). When analyzed within each cancer, GD3 expression was significantly higher only in DSRCT (P = 0.002). There was no statistical difference in either GD2 or GD3 expression between primary and recurrent sarcomas.

Efficacy of focal adhesion kinase inhibition in non-small cell lung cancer with oncogenically activated MAPK pathways.,British journal of cancer,Br. J. Cancer,2016-06-23,"Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is overexpressed in many types of tumours, including lung cancer. Y15, a small molecule which inhibits Y397 FAK autophosphorylation, decreases growth of human neuroblastoma, breast and pancreatic cancers. In this study, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo effects of Y15, and the underlying mechanism on non-small cell lung cancer cells. The cytotoxic effects of Y15 targeting FAK signalling were evaluated. Gene-knockdown experiments were performed to determine the anti-cancer mechanism. Xenografts with RAS or EGFR mutations were selected for in vivo Y15 treatment. Y15 blocked autophosphorylation of FAK in a time- and dose-dependent manner. It caused dose-dependent decrease of lung cancer cell viability and clonogenicity. Y15 inhibited tumour growth of RAS-mutant (A549 with KRAS mutation and H1299 with NRAS mutation), as well as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant (H1650 and H1975) lung cancer xenografts. JNK activation is a mechanism underlying Y15-induced Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 downregulation. Moreover, knockdown of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL potentiated the effects of Y15. The combination of various inhibitors of the Bcl-2 family of proteins with FAK inhibitors demonstrated synergy in multiple lung cancer cell lines in vitro. FAK inhibition demonstrated efficacy both in vitro and in vivo in lung cancers with either oncogenic RAS or EGFR mutations.

Radiation therapy consisted of 21 Gy in twice-daily fractions of 1.5 Gy each. Local failure (LF) was correlated with biologic prognostic factors and clinical findings at the time of diagnosis and start of RT. Median follow-up of surviving patients was 6.4 years. Cumulative incidence of LF was 7.1% at 2 years after RT and 9.8% at 5 years after RT. The isolated LF rate was 3.0%. Eighty-six percent of all local failures were within the RT field.

"Transcript Analysis for Internal Biodosimetry Using Peripheral Blood from Neuroblastoma Patients Treated with (131)I-mIBG, a Targeted Radionuclide.",Radiation research,Radiat. Res.,2016-08-24,"Calculating internal dose from therapeutic radionuclides currently relies on estimates made from multiple radiation exposure measurements, converted to absorbed dose in specific organs using the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) schema. As an alternative biodosimetric approach, we utilized gene expression analysis of whole blood from patients receiving targeted radiotherapy. Collected blood from patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma who received (131)I-labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine ((131)I-mIBG) at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) was used to compare calculated internal dose with the modulation of chosen gene expression. A total of 40 patients, median age 9 years, had blood drawn at baseline, 72 and 96 h after (131)I-mIBG infusion. Whole-body absorbed dose was calculated for each patient based on the cumulated activity determined from injected mIBG activity and patient-specific time-activity curves combined with (131)I whole-body S factors. We then assessed transcripts that were the most significant for describing the mixed therapeutic treatments over time using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Modulation was evaluated statistically using multiple regression analysis for data at 0, 72 and 96 h. A total of 10 genes were analyzed across 40 patients: CDKN1A; FDXR; GADD45A; BCLXL; STAT5B; BAX; BCL2; DDB2; XPC; and MDM2. Six genes were significantly modulated upon exposure to (131)I-mIBG at 72 h, as well as at 96 h. Four genes varied significantly with absorbed dose when controlling for time. A gene expression biodosimetry model was developed to predict absorbed dose based on modulation of gene transcripts within whole blood. Three transcripts explained over 98% of the variance in the modulation of gene expression over the 96 h (CDKN1A, BAX and DDB2). To our knowledge, this is a novel study, which uses whole blood collected from patients treated with a radiopharmaceutical, to characterize biomarkers that may be useful for biodosimetry. Our data indicate that transcripts, which have been previously identified as biomarkers of external exposures in ex vivo whole blood and in vivo radiotherapy patients, are also good early indicators of internal exposure. However, for internal sources of radiation, the biokinetics and physical decay of the radionuclide strongly influence the gene expression.",Journal Article,1245.0,7.0,Calculating internal dose from therapeutic radionuclides currently relies on estimates made from multiple radiation exposure measurements converted to absorbed dose in specific organs using the Medical Internal Radiation Dose MIRD schema As an alternative biodosimetric approach we utilized gene expression analysis of whole blood from patients receiving targeted radiotherapy Collected blood from patients with relapsed or refractory who received 131 I-labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine 131 I-mIBG at the University of California San Francisco UCSF was used to compare calculated internal dose with the modulation of chosen gene expression A total of 40 patients median age 9 years had blood drawn at baseline 72 and 96 h after 131 I-mIBG infusion Whole-body absorbed dose was calculated for each patient based on the cumulated activity determined from injected mIBG activity and patient-specific time-activity curves combined with 131 I whole-body S factors We then assessed transcripts that were the most significant for describing the mixed therapeutic treatments over time using real-time polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR Modulation was evaluated statistically using multiple regression analysis for data at 0 72 and 96 h.

Incidence and risk factors for secondary malignancy in patients with neuroblastoma after treatment with (131)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",Eur. J. Cancer,2016-08-27,"Several reports of second malignant neoplasm (SMN) in patients with relapsed neuroblastoma after treatment with (131)I-MIBG suggest the possibility of increased risk. Incidence of and risk factors for SMN after (131)I-MIBG have not been defined. This is a multi-institutional retrospective review of patients with neuroblastoma treated with (131)I-MIBG therapy. A competing risk approach was used to calculate the cumulative incidence of SMN from time of first exposure to (131)I-MIBG. A competing risk regression was used to identify potential risk factors for SMN. The analytical cohort included 644 patients treated with (131)I-MIBG. The cumulative incidence of SMN was 7.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4-13.0%) and 14.3% (95% CI, 8.3-23.9%) at 5 and 10 years from first (131)I-MIBG, respectively. No increase in SMN risk was found with increased number of (131)I-MIBG treatments or higher cumulative activity per kilogram of (131)I-MIBG received (p = 0.72 and p = 0.84, respectively). Thirteen of the 19 reported SMN were haematologic. In a multivariate analysis controlling for variables with p < 0.1 (stage, age at first (131)I-MIBG, bone disease, disease status at time of first (131)I-MIBG), patients with relapsed/progressive disease had significantly lower risk of SMN (subdistribution hazard ratio 0.3, 95% CI, 0.1-0.8, p = 0.023) compared to patients with persistent/refractory neuroblastoma. The cumulative risk of SMN after (131)I-MIBG therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma is similar to the greatest published incidence for high-risk neuroblastoma after myeloablative therapy, with no dose-dependent increase. As the number of patients treated and length of follow-up time increase, it will be important to reassess this risk.",Clinical Trial,1242.0,6.0,Several reports of second malignant neoplasm SMN in patients with relapsed after treatment with 131 I-MIBG suggest the possibility of increased risk Incidence of and risk factors for SMN after 131 I-MIBG have not been defined This is a multi-institutional retrospective review of patients with treated with 131 I-MIBG therapy A competing risk approach was used to calculate the cumulative incidence of SMN from time of first exposure to 131 I-MIBG A competing risk regression was used to identify potential risk factors for SMN The analytical cohort included 644 patients treated with 131 I-MIBG The cumulative incidence of SMN was 7.6 95 confidence interval CI 4.4-13.0 and 14.3 95 CI 8.3-23.9 at 5 and 10 years from first 131 I-MIBG respectively No increase in SMN risk was found with increased number of 131 I-MIBG treatments or higher cumulative activity per kilogram of 131 I-MIBG received p 0.72 and p 0.84 respectively Thirteen of the 19 reported SMN were haematologic In a multivariate analysis controlling for variables with p 0.1 stage age at first 131 I-MIBG disease disease status at time of first 131 I-MIBG patients with relapsed/progressive disease had significantly lower risk of SMN subdistribution hazard ratio 0.3 95 CI 0.1-0.8 p 0.023 compared to patients with persistent/refractory The cumulative risk of SMN after 131 I-MIBG therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory is similar to the greatest published incidence for high-risk after myeloablative therapy with no dose-dependent increase As the number of patients treated and length of follow-up time increase it will be important to reassess this risk,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[392, 1198, 1, 419, 393, 2131, 6474, 4, 7, 5, 591, 50, 24, 5, 2229, 70, 3574, 309, 3, 2526, 1, 101, 43, 287, 1, 2, 43, 130, 9, 6474, 50, 2229, 70, 3574, 47, 44, 85, 395, 26, 16, 8, 1414, 1115, 459, 206, 1, 7, 5, 73, 5, 2229, 70, 3574, 36, 8, 2573, 43, 353, 10, 95, 6, 3232, 3, 967, 287, 1, 6474, 29, 98, 1, 157, 645, 6, 2229, 70, 3574, 8, 2573, 43, 320, 10, 95, 6, 255, 174, 43, 130, 9, 6474, 3, 5625, 180, 159, 19847, 7, 73, 5, 2229, 70, 3574, 3, 967, 287, 1, 6474, 10, 67, 49, 48, 307, 268, 58, 39, 39, 233, 13, 2, 213, 27, 48, 58, 66, 27, 382, 83, 28, 33, 2, 79, 60, 29, 157, 2229, 70, 3574, 106, 77, 344, 4, 6474, 43, 10, 204, 5, 101, 207, 1, 2229, 70, 3574, 640, 15, 142, 967, 128, 379, 6543, 1, 2229, 70, 3574, 103, 19, 13, 720, 2, 19, 13, 874, 106, 3170, 1, 3, 326, 210, 6474, 11, 13851, 4, 8, 331, 65, 1893, 9, 682, 5, 19, 13, 14, 82, 89, 28, 157, 2229, 70, 3574, 34, 34, 156, 28, 98, 1, 157, 2229, 70, 3574, 7, 5, 591, 1014, 34, 42, 97, 280, 43, 1, 6474, 16584, 360, 197, 13, 27, 48, 58, 13, 14, 13, 66, 19, 13, 4482, 72, 6, 7, 5, 1882, 430, 3, 967, 43, 1, 6474, 50, 2229, 70, 3574, 36, 9, 7, 5, 591, 15, 430, 16, 288, 6, 3, 2199, 983, 287, 9, 64, 43, 50, 3246, 36, 5, 77, 61, 470, 344, 22, 3, 207, 1, 7, 73, 2, 1318, 1, 166, 126, 98, 344, 192, 303, 40, 305, 6, 19046, 26, 43]",1631.0,27573428,188
A phase I/Ib trial targeting the Pi3k/Akt pathway using perifosine: Long-term progression-free survival of patients with resistant neuroblastoma.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2016-09-30,"AKT plays a pivotal role in driving the malignant phenotype of many cancers, including high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NB). AKT signaling, however, is active in normal tissues, raising concern about excessive toxicity from its suppression. The oral AKT inhibitor perifosine showed tolerable toxicity in adults and in our phase I trial in children with solid tumors (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00776867). We now report on the HR-NB experience. HR-NB patients received perifosine 50-75 mg m<sup>-2</sup>  day<sup>-1</sup> after a loading dose of 100-200 mg m<sup>-2</sup> on day 1, and continued on study until progressive disease. The 27 HR-NB patients included three treated for primary refractory disease and 24 with disease resistant to salvage therapy after 1-5 (median 2) relapses; only one had MYCN-amplified HR-NB. Pharmacokinetic studies showed μM concentrations consistent with cytotoxic levels in preclinical models.

Integrative genomics reveals hypoxia inducible genes that are associated with a poor prognosis in neuroblastoma patients.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2016-11-01,"Neuroblastoma is notable for its broad spectrum of clinical behavior ranging from spontaneous regression to rapidly progressive disease. Hypoxia is well known to confer a more aggressive phenotype in neuroblastoma. We analyzed transcriptome data from diagnostic neuroblastoma tumors and hypoxic neuroblastoma cell lines to identify genes whose expression levels correlate with poor patient outcome and are involved in the hypoxia response. By integrating a diverse set of transcriptome datasets, including those from neuroblastoma patients and neuroblastoma derived cell lines, we identified nine genes (SLCO4A1, ENO1, HK2, PGK1, MTFP1, HILPDA, VKORC1, TPI1, and HIST1H1C) that are up-regulated in hypoxia and whose expression levels are correlated with poor patient outcome in three independent neuroblastoma cohorts. Analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and ENCODE data indicate that at least five of these nine genes have an increase in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and a more open chromatin structure in hypoxia versus normoxia and are putative targets of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) as they contain HIF binding sites in their regulatory regions. Four of these genes are key components of the glycolytic pathway and another three are directly involved in cellular metabolism. We experimentally validated our computational findings demonstrating that seven of the nine genes are significantly up-regulated in response to hypoxia in the four neuroblastoma cell lines tested.

Neuroblastoma.,Nature reviews. Disease primers,Nat Rev Dis Primers,2016-11-10,"Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumour occurring in childhood and has a diverse clinical presentation and course depending on the tumour biology. Unique features of these neuroendocrine tumours are the early age of onset, the high frequency of metastatic disease at diagnosis and the tendency for spontaneous regression of tumours in infancy. The most malignant tumours have amplification of the MYCN oncogene (encoding a transcription factor), which is usually associated with poor survival, even in localized disease. Although transgenic mouse models have shown that MYCN overexpression can be a tumour-initiating factor, many other cooperating genes and tumour suppressor genes are still under investigation and might also have a role in tumour development. Segmental chromosome alterations are frequent in neuroblastoma and are associated with worse outcome. The rare familial neuroblastomas are usually associated with germline mutations in ALK, which is mutated in 10-15% of primary tumours, and provides a potential therapeutic target. Risk-stratified therapy has facilitated the reduction of therapy for children with low-risk and intermediate-risk disease. Advances in therapy for patients with high-risk disease include intensive induction chemotherapy and myeloablative chemotherapy, followed by the treatment of minimal residual disease using differentiation therapy and immunotherapy; these have improved 5-year overall survival to 50%.

Impact of Extent of Resection on Local Control and Survival in Patients From the COG A3973 Study With High-Risk Neuroblastoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-11-21,"Purpose This analysis of patients in the Children's Oncology Group A3973 study evaluated the impact of extent of primary tumor resection on local progression and survival and assessed concordance between clinical and central imaging review-based assessments of resection extent. Patients and Methods The analytic cohort (n = 220) included patients who had both central surgery review and resection of the primary tumor site. For this analysis, resection categories of < 90% and ≥ 90% were used, with data on resection extent derived from operating surgeons' assessments (all patients), as well as blinded central imaging review of computed tomography scans for a subset of 84 patients; assessment results were compared for concordance. Treatment outcomes included event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and cumulative incidence of local progression (CILP). Results Surgeon-assessed extent of resection was ≥ 90% in 154 (70%) patients and < 90% in 66 (30%). Five-year EFS, OS, and CILP (± SE) were 43.5% ± 3.7%, 54.9% ± 3.7%, and 11.9% ± 2.2%, respectively. EFS was higher with ≥ 90% resection (45.9% ± 4.3%) than with < 90% resection (37.9% ± 7.2%; P = .04). Lower CILP ( P = .01) was associated with ≥ 90% resection (8.5% ± 2.3%) compared with < 90% resection (19.8% ± 5.0%). On multivariable analysis, ≥ 90% resection was associated with longer EFS after adjustment for MYCN amplification or diploidy but had no significant effect on OS. Concordance between surgeons' assessments of resection extent and central image-guided review was low, with agreement of 63% (< 90% v ≥ 90%; simple κ = -0.0301).

Pancreaticoduodenectomy for pediatric and adolescent pancreatic malignancy: A single-center retrospective analysis.,Journal of pediatric surgery,J. Pediatr. Surg.,2016-11-16,"While pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) has been extensively studied in adults, there are few data pertaining specifically to pediatric patients. We retrospectively analyzed PD-associated morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. Our analytic cohort included all consecutive patients ≤18years of age treated at our institution from 1993 to 2015 who underwent PD. Patient data (demographics, disease characteristics, surgical and adjuvant treatment, length of hospital stay, and postoperative course) were extracted from the medical records. We identified 12 children with a median age of 9years (7 female, 5 male). Final diagnoses were pancreatoblastoma (n=3), solid pseudopapillary tumor (n=3), neuroblastoma (n=2), rhabdomyosarcoma (n=2), and neuroendocrine carcinoma (n=2). Four patients underwent PD for resection of recurrent disease. 75% (9/12 patients) received neoadjuvant therapy. The median operative time was approximately 7hours with a mean blood loss of 590cm<sup>3</sup>. The distal pancreas was invaginated into the posterior stomach (n=3) or into the jejunum (n=5) or was directly sewn to the jejunal mucosa (n=4). There were no operative deaths. There were 4 patients (34%) with grade II complications, 1 with a grade IIIb complication (chest tube), and 1 with a grade IV complication (reexploration). The most common long-term morbidity was pancreas exocrine supplementation (n=10; 83%). Five patients (42%) diagnosed with either solid pseudopapillary tumor or rhabdomyosarcoma are currently alive with a mean survival of 77.4months.

Temporal stability and molecular persistence of the bone marrow plasma cell antibody repertoire.,Nature communications,Nat Commun,2016-12-21,"Plasma cells in human bone marrow (BM) are thought to be responsible for sustaining lifelong immunity, but its underlying basis is controversial. Here we use high-throughput sequence analysis of the same individual across 6.5 years to show that the BM plasma cell immunoglobulin heavy chain repertoire is remarkably stable over time. We find a nearly static bias in individual and combinatorial gene usage across time. Analysis of a second donor corroborates these observations. We also report the persistence of numerous BM plasma cell clonotypes (∼2%) identifiable at all points assayed across 6.5 years, supporting a model of serological memory based upon intrinsic longevity of human plasma cells.

We conducted this study to assess pharmacokinetics and identify the maximum tolerated dose for the combination. We performed a standard 3+3 phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study in patients with recurrent/refractory pediatric solid tumors. Four dose levels of perifosine (25-75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> /day) and temsirolimus (25-75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV weekly) were investigated.

Patterns of Relapse in High-Risk Neuroblastoma Patients Treated With and Without Total Body Irradiation.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2016-11-08,"External beam radiation therapy to initial sites of disease may influence relapse patterns in high-risk neuroblastoma. However, the effect of systemic irradiation by use of total body irradiation (TBI) on anatomic patterns of relapse has not previously been investigated. We retrospectively analyzed patients receiving definitive treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma with subsequent relapse in bony metastatic sites, with a date of relapse between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2012. Anatomic sites of disease, defined by metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) avidity, were compared at diagnosis and at first relapse. The Fisher exact test was performed to compare relapse in initially involved sites between patients treated with and without TBI. Seventy-four patients with a median age at diagnosis of 3.5 years (range, 0.3-15.3 years) had relapse in 227 sites of MIBG-avid metastatic disease, with a median time to relapse of 1.8 years. Of the 227 sites of first relapse, 154 sites (68%) were involved at diagnosis.

Genomic Profiling of a Large Set of Diverse Pediatric Cancers Identifies Known and Novel Mutations across Tumor Spectra.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2017-01-09,"Pediatric cancers are generally characterized by low mutational burden and few recurrently mutated genes. Recent studies suggest that genomic alterations may help guide treatment decisions and clinical trial selection. Here, we describe genomic profiles from 1,215 pediatric tumors representing sarcomas, extracranial embryonal tumors, brain tumors, hematologic malignancies, carcinomas, and gonadal tumors. Comparable published datasets identified similar frequencies of clinically relevant alterations, validating this dataset as biologically relevant. We identified novel ALK fusions in a neuroblastoma (BEND5-ALK) and an astrocytoma (PPP1CB-ALK), novel BRAF fusions in an astrocytoma (BCAS1-BRAF) and a ganglioglioma (TMEM106B-BRAF), and a novel PAX3-GLI2 fusion in a rhabdomyosarcoma. Previously characterized ALK, NTRK1, and PAX3 fusions were observed in unexpected malignancies, challenging the ""disease-specific"" alterations paradigm.

"Combination of bevacizumab, irinotecan, and temozolomide for refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma: Results of a phase II study.",Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2017-01-23,"The rationale for studying the combination of bevacizumab, irinotecan, and temozolomide (BIT) in neuroblastoma (NB) is based on the following: (i) vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression is associated with an aggressive phenotype, (ii) anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab enhances irinotecan-mediated suppression of NB xenografts, (iii) bevacizumab safety has been established in pediatric phase I studies, and (iv) irinotecan + temozolomide (IT) is a standard salvage chemotherapy. We conducted a phase II study of BIT in patients with measurable/evaluable refractory or relapsed high-risk NB (www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01114555). Each cycle consisted of bevacizumab (15 mg/kg intravenously [IV]) on days 1 and 15 plus irinotecan (50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> /day IV) and temozolomide (150 mg/m<sup>2</sup> /day orally) on days 4-8. Patients could have previously received, but not relapsed on, IT. An early stopping rule mandated continuing therapy only if more than five patients of 27 evaluable patients achieved partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) after four cycles. Thirty-three heavily pretreated patients (nine primary refractory; 24 relapsed) received one to eight cycles of BIT. Toxicities were expected and transient. Grade 4 toxicities were neutropenia (30%) and thrombocytopenia (24%). Grade 3 toxicities included hepatic transaminitis (15%), proteinuria (9%), and diarrhea (3%). Overall responses were as follows: three CR (all in prior IT-treated patients), 18 no response, and 12 progressive disease. Only one of 23 patients assessable for the early stopping rule regarding efficacy achieved PR/CR, so patient accrual was discontinued. Median progression-free survival and overall survival was 7.7 ± 1.7 and 31.5 ± 5.6 months, respectively; all patients continued anti-NB therapy post-BIT. BIT was well tolerated, but the addition of bevacizumab did not improve response rates in resistant NB compared to historical data for IT.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",1093.0,9.0,The rationale for studying the combination of bevacizumab irinotecan and temozolomide BIT in NB is based on the following i vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF expression is associated with an aggressive phenotype ii anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab enhances irinotecan-mediated suppression of NB xenografts iii bevacizumab safety has been established in pediatric phase I studies and iv irinotecan temozolomide IT is a standard salvage chemotherapy We conducted a phase II study of BIT in patients with measurable/evaluable refractory or relapsed high-risk NB www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT01114555 Each cycle consisted of bevacizumab 15 mg/kg intravenously IV on days 1 and 15 plus irinotecan 50 mg/m sup 2 /sup /day IV and temozolomide 150 mg/m sup 2 /sup /day orally on days 4-8 Patients could have previously received but not relapsed on IT An early stopping rule mandated continuing therapy only if more than five patients of 27 evaluable patients achieved partial response PR or complete response CR after four cycles Thirty-three heavily pretreated patients nine primary refractory 24 relapsed received one to eight cycles of BIT Toxicities were expected and transient Grade 4 toxicities were neutropenia 30 and thrombocytopenia 24 Grade 3 toxicities included hepatic transaminitis 15 proteinuria 9 and diarrhea 3 Overall responses were as follows three CR all in prior IT-treated patients 18 no response and 12 progressive disease Only one of 23 patients assessable for the early stopping rule regarding efficacy achieved PR/CR so patient accrual was discontinued Median progression-free survival and overall survival was 7.7 ± 1.7 and 31.5 ± 5.6 months respectively all patients continued anti-NB therapy post-BIT BIT was well tolerated but the addition of bevacizumab did not improve response rates in resistant NB compared to historical data for IT,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1728, 9, 4559, 3, 150, 1, 599, 1071, 2, 1537, 25799, 4, 3446, 16, 90, 23, 3, 366, 70, 756, 845, 129, 161, 618, 55, 16, 41, 5, 35, 571, 1005, 215, 312, 618, 548, 599, 2519, 1071, 517, 1332, 1, 3446, 1348, 316, 599, 367, 71, 85, 635, 4, 815, 124, 70, 94, 2, 478, 1071, 1537, 192, 16, 8, 260, 992, 56, 21, 426, 8, 124, 215, 45, 1, 25799, 4, 7, 5, 1884, 859, 430, 15, 591, 64, 43, 3446, 3064, 1252, 1239, 69701, 296, 417, 1695, 1, 599, 167, 81, 503, 1672, 478, 23, 162, 14, 2, 167, 349, 1071, 212, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 218, 478, 2, 1537, 1577, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 218, 1428, 23, 162, 39, 66, 7, 359, 47, 373, 103, 84, 44, 591, 23, 192, 35, 191, 6811, 5340, 10108, 4346, 36, 158, 492, 80, 76, 365, 7, 1, 428, 859, 7, 513, 450, 51, 998, 15, 236, 51, 684, 50, 294, 410, 977, 169, 2447, 2193, 7, 762, 86, 430, 259, 591, 103, 104, 6, 659, 410, 1, 25799, 385, 11, 1336, 2, 2473, 88, 39, 385, 11, 778, 201, 2, 1340, 259, 88, 27, 385, 159, 939, 8181, 167, 5381, 83, 2, 1172, 27, 63, 253, 11, 22, 2962, 169, 684, 62, 4, 324, 192, 73, 7, 203, 77, 51, 2, 133, 1014, 34, 158, 104, 1, 382, 7, 3120, 9, 3, 191, 6811, 5340, 666, 209, 513, 998, 684, 1743, 69, 2262, 10, 2402, 52, 91, 115, 25, 2, 63, 25, 10, 67, 67, 810, 14, 67, 2, 456, 33, 810, 33, 49, 53, 106, 62, 7, 1351, 312, 3446, 36, 539, 25799, 25799, 10, 149, 421, 84, 3, 352, 1, 599, 205, 44, 401, 51, 151, 4, 436, 3446, 72, 6, 2252, 74, 9, 192]",1858.0,28111925,356

Most common treatment-related adverse events (AE) were hematologic: neutropenia (72% all-grade/63% grade 3/4), leukopenia (63%/38%), anemia (44%/3%), thrombocytopenia (44%/28%), and lymphopenia (38%/19%), followed by vomiting (38%/0%), fatigue (25%/3%), nausea (25%/0%), and QTc prolongation (22%/0%). Ribociclib exposure was dose-dependent at 350 and 470 mg/m<sup>2</sup> [equivalent to 600 (RP2D)-900 mg in adults], with high interpatient variability. Best overall response was stable disease (SD) in nine patients (seven with neuroblastoma, two with primary CNS MRT); five patients achieved SD for more than 6, 6, 8, 12, and 13 cycles, respectively.<b>Conclusions:</b> Ribociclib demonstrated acceptable safety and PK in pediatric patients.

Comprehensive Genomic Profiling of Esthesioneuroblastoma Reveals Additional Treatment Options.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2017-05-11,"Esthesioneuroblastoma (ENB), also known as olfactory neuroblastoma, is a rare malignant neoplasm of the olfactory mucosa. Despite surgical resection combined with radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy, ENB often relapses with rapid progression. Current multimodality, nontargeted therapy for relapsed ENB is of limited clinical benefit. We queried whether comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) of relapsed or refractory ENB can uncover genomic alterations (GA) that could identify potential targeted therapies for these patients. CGP was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections from 41 consecutive clinical cases of ENBs using a hybrid-capture, adaptor ligation based next-generation sequencing assay to a mean coverage depth of 593X. The results were analyzed for base substitutions, insertions and deletions, select rearrangements, and copy number changes (amplifications and homozygous deletions). Clinically relevant GA (CRGA) were defined as GA linked to drugs on the market or under evaluation in clinical trials. A total of 28 ENBs harbored GA, with a mean of 1.5 GA per sample. Approximately half of the ENBs (21, 51%) featured at least one CRGA, with an average of 1 CRGA per sample. The most commonly altered gene was <i>TP53</i> (17%), with GA in <i>PIK3CA</i>, <i>NF1</i>, <i>CDKN2A</i>, and <i>CDKN2C</i> occurring in 7% of samples. We report comprehensive genomic profiles for 41 ENB tumors. CGP revealed potential new therapeutic targets, including targetable GA in the mTOR, CDK and growth factor signaling pathways, highlighting the clinical value of genomic profiling in ENB. Comprehensive genomic profiling of 41 relapsed or refractory ENBs reveals recurrent alterations or classes of mutation, including amplification of tyrosine kinases encoded on chromosome 5q and mutations affecting genes in the mTOR/PI3K pathway.

A phase I study of single-agent perifosine for recurrent or refractory pediatric CNS and solid tumors.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2017-06-05,"The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is aberrantly activated in various pediatric tumors. We conducted a phase I study of the Akt inhibitor perifosine in patients with recurrent/refractory pediatric CNS and solid tumors. This was a standard 3+3 open-label dose-escalation study to assess pharmacokinetics, describe toxicities, and identify the MTD for single-agent perifosine. Five dose levels were investigated, ranging from 25 to 125 mg/m2/day for 28 days per cycle. Twenty-three patients (median age 10 years, range 4-18 years) with CNS tumors (DIPG [n = 3], high-grade glioma [n = 5], medulloblastoma [n = 2], ependymoma [n = 3]), neuroblastoma (n = 8), Wilms tumor (n = 1), and Ewing sarcoma (n = 1) were treated. Only one DLT occurred (grade 4 hyperuricemia at dose level 4). The most common grade 3 or 4 toxicity at least possibly related to perifosine was neutropenia (8.7%), with the remaining grade 3 or 4 toxicities (fatigue, hyperglycemia, fever, hyperuricemia, and catheter-related infection) occurring in one patient each. Pharmacokinetics was dose-saturable at doses above 50 mg/m2/day with significant inter-patient variability, consistent with findings reported in adult studies. One patient with DIPG (dose level 5) and 4 of 5 patients with high-grade glioma (dose levels 2 and 3) experienced stable disease for two months. Five subjects with neuroblastoma (dose levels 1 through 4) achieved stable disease which was prolonged (≥11 months) in three. No objective responses were noted. In conclusion, the use of perifosine was safe and feasible in patients with recurrent/refractory pediatric CNS and solid tumors. An MTD was not defined by the 5 dose levels investigated.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors for metastatic colorectal cancer.,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,2017-06-27,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors prevent cell growth and have shown benefit in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, whether used as single agents or in combination with chemotherapy. Clear benefit has been shown in trials of EGFR monoclonal antibodies (EGFR MAb) but not EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKI). However, there is ongoing debate as to which patient populations gain maximum benefit from EGFR inhibition and where they should be used in the metastatic colorectal cancer treatment paradigm to maximise efficacy and minimise toxicity. To determine the efficacy, safety profile, and potential harms of EGFR inhibitors in the treatment of people with metastatic colorectal cancer when given alone, in combination with chemotherapy, or with other biological agents.The primary outcome of interest was progression-free survival; secondary outcomes included overall survival, tumour response rate, quality of life, and adverse events. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Library, Issue 9, 2016; Ovid MEDLINE (from 1950); and Ovid Embase (from 1974) on 9 September 2016; and ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) on 14 March 2017. We also searched proceedings from the major oncology conferences ESMO, ASCO, and ASCO GI from 2012 to December 2016. We further scanned reference lists from eligible publications and contacted corresponding authors for trials for further information where needed. We included randomised controlled trials on participants with metastatic colorectal cancer comparing: 1) the combination of EGFR MAb and 'standard therapy' (whether chemotherapy or best supportive care) to standard therapy alone, 2) the combination of EGFR TKI and standard therapy to standard therapy alone, 3) the combination of EGFR inhibitor (whether MAb or TKI) and standard therapy to another EGFR inhibitor (or the same inhibitor with a different dosing regimen) and standard therapy, or 4) the combination of EGFR inhibitor (whether MAb or TKI), anti-angiogenic therapy, and standard therapy to anti-angiogenic therapy and standard therapy alone. We used standard methodological procedures defined by Cochrane. Summary statistics for the endpoints used hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for overall survival and progression-free survival, and odds ratios (OR) for response rate (RR) and toxicity. Subgroup analyses were performed by Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) and neuroblastoma RAS viral (V-Ras) oncogene homolog (NRAS) status - firstly by status of KRAS exon 2 testing (mutant or wild type) and also by status of extended KRAS/NRAS testing (any mutation present or wild type). We identified 33 randomised controlled trials for analysis (15,025 participants), including trials of both EGFR MAb and EGFR TKI. Looking across studies, significant risk of bias was present, particularly with regard to the risk of selection bias (15/33 unclear risk, 1/33 high risk), performance bias (9/33 unclear risk, 9/33 high risk), and detection bias (7/33 unclear risk, 11/33 high risk).The addition of EGFR MAb to standard therapy in the KRAS exon 2 wild-type population improves progression-free survival (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.82; high-quality evidence), overall survival (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98; high-quality evidence), and response rate (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.41; high-quality evidence). We noted evidence of significant statistical heterogeneity in all three of these analyses (progression-free survival: I<sup>2</sup> = 76%; overall survival: I<sup>2</sup> = 40%; and response rate: I<sup>2</sup> = 77%), likely due to pooling of studies investigating EGFR MAb use in different lines of therapy. Rates of overall grade 3 to 4 toxicity, diarrhoea, and rash were increased (moderate-quality evidence for all three outcomes), but there was no evidence for increased rates of neutropenia.For the extended RAS wild-type population (no mutations in KRAS or NRAS), addition of EGFR MAb improved progression-free survival (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.75; moderate-quality evidence) and overall survival (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.88; high-quality evidence). Response rate was also improved (OR 4.28, 95% CI 2.61 to 7.03; moderate-quality evidence). We noted significant statistical heterogeneity in the progression-free survival analysis (I<sup>2</sup> = 61%), likely due to the pooling of studies combining EGFR MAb with chemotherapy with monotherapy studies.We observed no evidence of a statistically significant difference when EGFR MAb was compared to bevacizumab, in progression-free survival (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.12; high quality evidence) or overall survival (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.01; moderate-quality evidence). We noted significant statistical heterogeneity in the overall survival analysis (I<sup>2</sup> = 51%), likely due to the pooling of first-line and second-line studies.The addition of EGFR TKI to standard therapy in molecularly unselected participants did not show benefit in limited data sets (meta-analysis not performed). The addition of EGFR MAb to bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in people with KRAS exon 2 wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer did not improve progression-free survival (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.29; very low quality evidence), overall survival (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.47; low-quality evidence), or response rate (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.12; very low-quality evidence) but increased toxicity (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.45 to 4.57; low-quality evidence). We noted significant between-study heterogeneity in most analyses.Scant information on quality of life was reported in the identified studies. The addition of EGFR MAb to either chemotherapy or best supportive care improves progression-free survival (moderate- to high-quality evidence), overall survival (high-quality evidence), and tumour response rate (moderate- to high-quality evidence), but may increase toxicity in people with KRAS exon 2 wild-type or extended RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (moderate-quality evidence). The addition of EGFR TKI to standard therapy does not improve clinical outcomes. EGFR MAb combined with bevacizumab is of no clinical value (very low-quality evidence).

Retinoblastoma and Neuroblastoma Predisposition and Surveillance.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2017-07-01,"Retinoblastoma (RB) is the most common intraocular malignancy in childhood. Approximately 40% of retinoblastomas are hereditary and due to germline mutations in the <i>RB1</i> gene. Children with hereditary RB are also at risk for developing a midline intracranial tumor, most commonly pineoblastoma. We recommend intensive ocular screening for patients with germline <i>RB1</i> mutations for retinoblastoma as well as neuroimaging for pineoblastoma surveillance. There is an approximately 20% risk of developing second primary cancers among individuals with hereditary RB, higher among those who received radiotherapy for their primary RB tumors. However, there is not yet a clear consensus on what, if any, screening protocol would be most appropriate and effective. Neuroblastoma (NB), an embryonal tumor of the sympathetic nervous system, accounts for 15% of pediatric cancer deaths. Prior studies suggest that about 2% of patients with NB have an underlying genetic predisposition that may have contributed to the development of NB. Germline mutations in <i>ALK</i> and <i>PHOX2B</i> account for most familial NB cases. However, other cancer predisposition syndromes, such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome, RASopathies, and others, may be associated with an increased risk for NB. No established protocols for NB surveillance currently exist. Here, we describe consensus recommendations on hereditary RB and NB from the AACR Childhood Cancer Predisposition Workshop. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(13); e98-e106. ©2017 AACR</i><b>See all articles in the online-only <i>CCR</i> Pediatric Oncology Series</b>.",Journal Article,934.0,35.0,RB is the most common intraocular malignancy in childhood Approximately 40 of retinoblastomas are hereditary and due to germline mutations in the i RB1 /i gene Children with hereditary RB are also at risk for developing a midline intracranial tumor most commonly pineoblastoma We recommend intensive ocular screening for patients with germline i RB1 /i mutations for as well as neuroimaging for pineoblastoma surveillance There is an approximately 20 risk of developing second primary cancers among individuals with hereditary RB higher among those who received radiotherapy for their primary RB tumors However there is not yet a clear consensus on what if any screening protocol would be most appropriate and effective NB an embryonal tumor of the sympathetic nervous system accounts for 15 of pediatric cancer deaths Prior studies suggest that about 2 of patients with NB have an underlying genetic predisposition that may have contributed to the development of NB Germline mutations in i ALK /i and i PHOX2B /i account for most familial NB cases However other cancer predisposition syndromes such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome RASopathies and others may be associated with an increased risk for NB No established protocols for NB surveillance currently exist Here we describe consensus recommendations on hereditary RB and NB from the AACR Childhood Cancer Predisposition Workshop i Clin Cancer Res 23 13 e98-e106 ©2017 AACR /i b See all articles in the online-only i CCR /i Pediatric Oncology Series /b,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2955, 16, 3, 96, 186, 8600, 710, 4, 864, 705, 327, 1, 18431, 32, 2305, 2, 520, 6, 1009, 138, 4, 3, 70, 4596, 70, 145, 541, 5, 2305, 2955, 32, 120, 28, 43, 9, 931, 8, 8677, 2089, 30, 96, 841, 14221, 21, 2237, 1686, 4345, 453, 9, 7, 5, 1009, 70, 4596, 70, 138, 9, 22, 149, 22, 7468, 9, 14221, 617, 125, 16, 35, 705, 179, 43, 1, 931, 419, 86, 163, 107, 869, 5, 2305, 2955, 142, 107, 135, 54, 103, 310, 9, 136, 86, 2955, 57, 137, 125, 16, 44, 1145, 8, 885, 1391, 23, 2067, 492, 500, 453, 1182, 688, 40, 96, 870, 2, 323, 3446, 35, 5239, 30, 1, 3, 11277, 1880, 398, 4162, 9, 167, 1, 815, 12, 1043, 324, 94, 309, 17, 545, 18, 1, 7, 5, 3446, 47, 35, 1181, 336, 2863, 17, 68, 47, 3447, 6, 3, 193, 1, 3446, 1009, 138, 4, 70, 1023, 70, 2, 70, 26759, 70, 1967, 9, 96, 2200, 3446, 140, 137, 127, 12, 2863, 2040, 225, 22, 5066, 9130, 681, 48878, 2, 1749, 68, 40, 41, 5, 35, 101, 43, 9, 3446, 77, 635, 2189, 9, 3446, 617, 694, 1923, 467, 21, 897, 1391, 883, 23, 2305, 2955, 2, 3446, 29, 3, 1630, 864, 12, 2863, 4014, 70, 2459, 12, 1936, 382, 233, 70748, 70749, 3194, 1630, 70, 132, 3764, 62, 2384, 4, 3, 4123, 158, 70, 4992, 70, 815, 413, 988, 132]",1500.0,28674118,205
Long-term Pulmonary Outcomes in Pediatric Survivors of High-risk Neuroblastoma.,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol.,2017-10-01,"Children with high-risk neuroblastoma are exposed to multimodality therapies early in life and survivors confront late therapy-related toxicities. This study assessed respiratory symptoms, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and risk factors for abnormalities among survivors. High-risk neuroblastoma survivors followed in the long-term follow-up clinic at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center were enrolled. Self-administered symptom questionnaires were completed. Medical records were reviewed for treatment information and comorbidities. PFTs included spirometry, plethysmography, and diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). Thirty-nine survivors participated (median age at study: 11.4 y; median age at diagnosis: 2.3 y; median time since completion of therapy: 5.5 y). Chronic respiratory symptoms were reported for 33%. PFT abnormalities were identified in 79% and included low forced expiratory volume in 1 second (38%), decreased total lung capacity (44%), and abnormal DLCO (67%). PFT abnormalities were mostly mild to moderate. Mean forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and total lung capacity were normal and mean DLCO was mildly abnormal.

"Association of MYCN copy number with clinical features, tumor biology, and outcomes in neuroblastoma: A report from the Children's Oncology Group.",Cancer,Cancer,2017-07-11,"High-level MYCN amplification (MNA) is associated with poor outcome and unfavorable clinical and biological features in patients with neuroblastoma. To the authors' knowledge, less is known regarding these associations in patients with low-level MYCN copy number increases. In this retrospective study, the authors classified patients has having tumors with MYCN wild-type tumors, MYCN gain (2-4-fold increase in MYCN signal compared with the reference probe), or MNA (>4-fold increase). Tests of trend were used to investigate ordered associations between MYCN copy number category and features of interest. Log-rank tests and Cox models compared event-free survival and overall survival by subgroup. Among 4672 patients, 3694 (79.1%) had MYCN wild-type tumors, 133 (2.8%) had MYCN gain, and 845 (18.1%) had MNA. For each clinical/biological feature, the percentage of patients with an unfavorable feature was lowest in the MYCN wild-type category, intermediate in the MYCN gain category, and highest in the MNA category (P<.0001), except for 11q aberration, for which the highest rates were in the MYCN gain category. Patients with MYCN gain had inferior event-free survival and overall survival compared with those with MYCN wild-type. Among patients with high-risk disease, MYCN gain was associated with the lowest response rate after chemotherapy. Patients with non-stage 4 disease (according to the International Neuroblastoma Staging System) and patients with non-high-risk disease with MYCN gain had a significantly increased risk for death, a finding confirmed on multivariable testing. Increasing MYCN copy number is associated with an increasingly higher rate of unfavorable clinical/biological features, with 11q aberration being an exception. Patients with MYCN gain appear to have inferior outcomes, especially in otherwise more favorable groups.

Biodistribution and Dosimetry of <sup>18</sup>F-Meta-Fluorobenzylguanidine: A First-in-Human PET/CT Imaging Study of Patients with Neuroendocrine Malignancies.,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",J. Nucl. Med.,2017-07-13,"<sup>123</sup>I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (<sup>123</sup>I-MIBG) imaging is currently a mainstay in the evaluation of many neuroendocrine tumors, especially neuroblastoma. <sup>123</sup>I-MIBG imaging has several limitations that can be overcome by the use of a PET agent. <sup>18</sup>F-meta-fluorobenzylguanidine (<sup>18</sup>F-MFBG) is a PET analog of MIBG that may allow for single-day, high-resolution quantitative imaging. We conducted a first-in-human study of <sup>18</sup>F-MFBG PET imaging to evaluate the safety, feasibility, pharmacokinetics, and dosimetry of <sup>18</sup>F-MFBG in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). <b>Methods:</b> Ten patients (5 with neuroblastoma and 5 with paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma) received 148-444 MBq (4-12mCi) of <sup>18</sup>F-MFBG intravenously followed by serial whole-body imaging at 0.5-1, 1-2, and 3-4 after injection. Serial blood samples (a total of 6) were also obtained starting at 5 min after injection to as late as 4 h after injection; whole-body distribution and blood clearance data, lesion uptake, and normal-tissue uptake were determined, and radiation-absorbed doses to normal organs were calculated using OLINDA. <b>Results:</b> No side effects were seen in any patient after <sup>18</sup>F-MFBG injection. Tracer distribution showed prominent activity in the blood pool, liver, and salivary glands that decreased with time. Mild uptake was seen in the kidneys and spleen, which also decreased with time. Urinary excretion was prominent, with an average of 45% of the administered activity in the bladder by 1 h after injection; whole-body clearance was monoexponential, with a mean biologic half-life of 1.95 h, whereas blood clearance was biexponential, with a mean biologic half-life of 0.3 h (58%) for the rapid α phase and 6.1 h (42%) for the slower β phase. The urinary bladder received the highest radiation dose with a mean absorbed dose of 0.186 ± 0.195 mGy/MBq. The mean total-body dose was 0.011 ± 0.011 mGy/MBq, and the effective dose was 0.023 ± 0.012 mSv/MBq. Both skeletal and soft-tissue lesions were visualized with high contrast. The SUVmax (mean ± SD ) of lesions at 1-2 h after injection was 8.6 ± 9.6. <b>Conclusion:</b> Preliminary data show that <sup>18</sup>F-MFBG imaging is safe and has favorable biodistribution and kinetics with good targeting of lesions.

Bevacizumab-associated Bowel Microperforation in a Patient With Neuroblastoma.,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol.,2018-08-01,"The antivascular endothelial growth factor antibody, bevacizumab, is effective against several malignancies in adults but unproven in pediatric oncology. In early phase pediatric studies toxicities were similar to those in adults. Bowel perforation in adults is a rare but serious toxicity, but has not been hitherto reported in children. A 5-year-old boy with chemoresistant neuroblastoma treated with bevacizumab plus radioimmunotherapy developed acute abdominal pain.

Renal Function Outcomes of High-risk Neuroblastoma Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2017-04-11,"To analyze the renal function outcomes in patients undergoing radiation therapy for neuroblastoma. The clinical metrics of renal function were analyzed in patients undergoing radiation therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma from 2000 to 2015. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine values before radiation therapy were compared with last available follow-up values and analyzed with the clinical circumstances, including follow-up length, age at primary irradiation, nephrectomy, and radiation technique. The creatinine clearance was estimated using the Shull method. With a median follow-up period of 3.5 years, none of the 266 patients studied developed a chronic renal insufficiency. For all patients, the creatinine level increased from 0.44 to 0.51 mg/dL and the BUN increased from 10.53 to 15.52 mg/dL. Three patients required antihypertensive medication. The patients who underwent intensity modulated radiation therapy did not experience increased creatinine levels during the follow-up period; however, they had a reduced median follow-up length compared with patients treated with anteroposterior/posteroanterior beams (4.7 vs 3.3 years). A longer follow-up length was associated with an increased creatinine level. The preradiation therapy creatinine level increased with patient age, similar to that of the last follow-up creatinine level, suggesting that the changes in creatinine could likely be explained by physiologic increases associated with aging rather than radiation-induced renal damage. The creatinine clearance did not decrease in any circumstance. The present cohort had excellent renal outcomes after radiation therapy for neuroblastoma. No patient developed chronic renal insufficiency, and the small increases in BUN and creatinine we observed correlated, as expected, with increases in patient age. The results of the present study revealed a possible advantage for intensity modulated radiation therapy in preserving renal function; however, the follow-up length is a recognized confounding variable.

Cancer Res.,2017-09-22,"<b>Purpose:</b> Anti-GD2 mAbs, acting via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, may enhance the effects of chemotherapy. This pilot trial investigated a fixed dose of a unique anti-GD2 mAb, hu14.18K322A, combined with chemotherapy, cytokines, and haploidentical natural killer (NK) cells.<b>Experimental Design:</b> Children with recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma received up to six courses of hu14.18K322A (40 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/dose, days 2-5), GM-CSF, and IL2 with chemotherapy: cyclophosphamide/topotecan (courses 1,2), irinotecan/temozolomide (courses 3,4), and ifosfamide/carboplatin/etoposide (courses 5,6). Parentally derived NK cells were administered with courses 2, 4, and 6. Serum for pharmacokinetic studies of hu14.18K322A, soluble IL2 receptor alpha (sIL2Rα) levels, and human antihuman antibodies (HAHA) were obtained.<b>Results:</b> Thirteen heavily pretreated patients (9 with prior anti-GD2 therapy) completed 65 courses. One patient developed an unacceptable toxicity (grade 4 thrombocytopenia >35 days). Four patients discontinued treatment for adverse events (hu14.18K322A allergic reaction, viral infection, surgical death, second malignancy).

PTPN11 induces endoplasmic stress and apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells.,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,2017-09-22,"PTPN11 is associated with regulation of growth factor signaling pathways in neuronal cells. Using SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, we showed that adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated PTPN11 upregulation was associated with TrkB antagonism, reduced neuritogenesis and enhanced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response leading to apoptotic changes. Genetic knock-down of PTPN11 on the other hand leads to increased TrkB phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells. ER stress response induced by PTPN11 upregulation was alleviated pharmacologically by a TrkB agonist. Conversely the enhanced ER stress response induced by TrkB receptor antagonism was ameliorated by PTPN11 suppression, providing evidence of cross-talk of PTPN11 effects with TrkB actions. BDNF treatment of neuronal cells with PTPN11 upregulation also resulted in reduced expression of ER stress protein markers. This study provides evidence of molecular interactions between PTPN11 and the TrkB receptor in SH-SY5Y cells. The results reinforce the role played by PTPN11 in regulating neurotrophin protective signaling in neuronal cells and highlight that PTPN11 dysregulation promotes apoptotic activation.

"PD-L1, inflammation, non-coding RNAs, and neuroblastoma: Immuno-oncology perspective.",Seminars in cancer biology,Semin. Cancer Biol.,2017-11-28,"Neuroblastoma is the most common pediatric solid tumor of neural crest origin. The current treatment options for neuroblastoma produce severe side effects. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), chronic inflammation, and non-coding RNAs are known to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma. Cancer cells and the surrounding cells in the tumor microenvironment express PD-L1. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is a co-receptor expressed predominantly by T cells. The binding of PD-1 to its ligands, PD-L1 or PD-L2, is vital for the physiologic regulation of the immune system. Chronic inflammation is involved in the recruitment of leukocytes, production of cytokines and chemokines that in turn, lead to survival, metastasis, and angiogenesis in neuroblastoma tumors. The miRNAs and long non-coding (lnc) RNAs have emerged as a novel class of non-coding RNAs that can regulate neuroblastoma associated cell-signaling pathways. The dysregulation of PD-1/PD-L1, inflammatory pathways, lncRNAs, and miRNAs have been reported in clinical and experimental samples of neuroblastoma. These signaling molecules are currently being evaluated for their potential as the biomarker and therapeutic targets in the management of neuroblastoma. A monoclonal antibody called dinutuximab (Unituxin) that attaches to a carbohydrate molecule GD2, on the surface of many neuroblastoma cells, is being used as an immunotherapy drug for neuroblastoma treatment.

CRISPR-Cas9 screen reveals a MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma dependency on EZH2.,The Journal of clinical investigation,J. Clin. Invest.,2017-12-04,"Pharmacologically difficult targets, such as MYC transcription factors, represent a major challenge in cancer therapy. For the childhood cancer neuroblastoma, amplification of the oncogene MYCN is associated with high-risk disease and poor prognosis. Here, we deployed genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screening of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma and found a preferential dependency on genes encoding the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) components EZH2, EED, and SUZ12. Genetic and pharmacological suppression of EZH2 inhibited neuroblastoma growth in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, compared with neuroblastomas without MYCN amplification, MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas expressed higher levels of EZH2. ChIP analysis showed that MYCN binds at the EZH2 promoter, thereby directly driving expression. Transcriptomic and epigenetic analysis, as well as genetic rescue experiments, revealed that EZH2 represses neuronal differentiation in neuroblastoma in a PRC2-dependent manner. Moreover, MYCN-amplified and high-risk primary tumors from patients with neuroblastoma exhibited strong repression of EZH2-regulated genes. Additionally, overexpression of IGFBP3, a direct EZH2 target, suppressed neuroblastoma growth in vitro and in vivo. We further observed strong synergy between histone deacetylase inhibitors and EZH2 inhibitors. Together, these observations demonstrate that MYCN upregulates EZH2, leading to inactivation of a tumor suppressor program in neuroblastoma, and support testing EZH2 inhibitors in patients with MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma.",Journal Article,778.0,18.0,Pharmacologically difficult targets such as MYC transcription factors represent a major challenge in cancer therapy For the childhood cancer amplification of the oncogene MYCN is associated with high-risk disease and poor prognosis Here we deployed genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screening of MYCN-amplified and found a preferential dependency on genes encoding the polycomb repressive complex 2 PRC2 components EZH2 EED and SUZ12 Genetic and pharmacological suppression of EZH2 inhibited growth in vitro and in vivo Moreover compared with neuroblastomas without MYCN amplification MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas expressed higher levels of EZH2 ChIP analysis showed that MYCN binds at the EZH2 promoter thereby directly driving expression Transcriptomic and epigenetic analysis as well as genetic rescue experiments revealed that EZH2 represses neuronal differentiation in in a PRC2-dependent manner Moreover MYCN-amplified and high-risk primary tumors from patients with exhibited strong repression of EZH2-regulated genes Additionally overexpression of IGFBP3 a direct EZH2 target suppressed growth in vitro and in vivo We further observed strong synergy between histone deacetylase inhibitors and EZH2 inhibitors Together these observations demonstrate that MYCN upregulates EZH2 leading to inactivation of a tumor suppressor program in and support testing EZH2 inhibitors in patients with MYCN-amplified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[7854, 1740, 637, 225, 22, 1371, 866, 130, 1231, 8, 458, 1745, 4, 12, 36, 9, 3, 864, 12, 1073, 1, 3, 1836, 4068, 16, 41, 5, 64, 43, 34, 2, 334, 356, 467, 21, 15019, 898, 1124, 7736, 9071, 453, 1, 4068, 2429, 2, 204, 8, 6629, 6359, 23, 214, 2362, 3, 8666, 9851, 840, 18, 9321, 1628, 3755, 14690, 2, 20862, 336, 2, 3419, 1332, 1, 3755, 879, 129, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 1393, 72, 5, 8915, 187, 4068, 1073, 4068, 2429, 8915, 570, 142, 148, 1, 3755, 4222, 65, 224, 17, 4068, 3333, 28, 3, 3755, 973, 2267, 1606, 4057, 55, 5983, 2, 1418, 65, 22, 149, 22, 336, 4256, 2332, 553, 17, 3755, 10946, 7020, 910, 4, 4, 8, 9321, 470, 1708, 1393, 4068, 2429, 2, 64, 43, 86, 57, 29, 7, 5, 1416, 1082, 5255, 1, 3755, 1065, 214, 1724, 851, 1, 8814, 8, 1196, 3755, 283, 1908, 129, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 21, 195, 164, 1082, 3439, 59, 1508, 2732, 222, 2, 3755, 222, 1162, 46, 2172, 608, 17, 4068, 9641, 3755, 1049, 6, 2297, 1, 8, 30, 1245, 1243, 4, 2, 538, 471, 3755, 222, 4, 7, 5, 4068, 2429]",1400.0,29202477,35
High expression of β-catenin contributes to the crizotinib resistant phenotype in the stem-like cell population in neuroblastoma.,Scientific reports,Sci Rep,2017-12-04,"ALK has been identified as a novel therapeutic target in neuroblastoma (NB), but resistance to ALK inhibitors (such as crizotinib) is well recognized. We recently published that the crizotinib sensitivity in NB cells strongly correlates with the crizotinib-ALK binding, and β-catenin effectively hinders this interaction and confers crizotinib resistance. Here, we asked if these observations hold true for the stem-like cells in NB cells, which were purified based on their responsiveness to a Sox2 reporter. Compared to bulk, reporter unresponsive (RU) cells, reporter responsive (RR) cells had significantly higher neurosphere formation ability, expression of CD133/nestin and chemo-resistance. Using the cellular thermal shift assay, we found that RR cells exhibited significantly weaker crizotinib-ALK binding and higher crizotinib resistance than RU cells. The suboptimal crizotinib-ALK binding in RR cells can be attributed to their high β-catenin expression, since siRNA knockdown of β-catenin restored the crizotinib-ALK binding and lowered the crizotinib resistance to the level of RU cells. Enforced expression of β-catenin in RU cells resulted in the opposite effects. To conclude, high expression of β-catenin in the stem-like NB cells contributes to their crizotinib resistance.

Retrospective review of ONB patients treated from 1992 to 2013 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center (The University of Texas, Houston, Texas, U.S.A.). Primary outcomes were overall and disease-free survival. Thirty-five patients were identified. Most patients had Kadish A/B. tumors (97%), Hyams grade 2 (70%), with unilateral involvement (91%), and arising from the nasal cavity (68%). Tumor involved the mucosa abutting the skull base in 42% of patients. Twenty-five patients (71%) received surgery and radiation, whereas the remainder had surgery alone. Five patients (14%) had bony skull base resection, and eight patients (23%) had resection of bony skull base, dura, and olfactory bulb. Surgical margins were grossly positive in one patient (3%) and microscopically positive in four patients (12%). The 5- and 10-year overall survival were 93% and 81%, respectively. The 5- and 10-year disease-free survival (DFS) were 89% and 78%, respectively. Bony cribriform plate resection was associated with better DFS (P = 0.05), but dura and olfactory bulb resection was not (P = 0.11). There was a trend toward improved DFS in patients with negative resection margins (P = 0.19). Surgical modality (open vs. endoscopic) and postoperative radiotherapy did not impact DFS.

Importin-β and exportin-5 are strong biomarkers of productive reoviral infection of cancer cells.,Annals of diagnostic pathology,Ann Diagn Pathol,2017-10-07,"Acute reoviral infection has been extensively studied given the virus's propensity to target malignant cells and activate caspase-3 mediated apoptosis. Reovirus infection of malignant N1E-115 mouse neuroblastoma cells led to significant increased expression of importin-β and exportin-5 mRNAs (qRTPCR) and proteins (immunohistochemistry) which was partially blocked by small interfering LNA oligomers directed against the reoviral genome. Co-expression analysis showed that the N1E-115 cells that contained reoviral capsid protein had accumulated importin-β and exportin-5, as well as activated caspase 3. Reoviral oncolysis using a syngeneic mouse model of multiple myeloma similarly induced a significant increase in importin-β and exportin-5 proteins that were co-expressed with reoviral capsid protein and caspase-3.

Radiation Therapy to Sites of Metastatic Disease as Part of Consolidation in High-Risk Neuroblastoma: Can Long-term Control Be Achieved?,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2018-01-09,"As part of consolidative therapy in high-risk neuroblastoma, modern protocols recommend radiation therapy (RT) both to the primary site and to sites of metastatic disease that persist after induction chemotherapy. Although there are abundant data showing excellent local control (LC) with 21 Gy directed at the primary site, there are few data describing the feasibility and efficacy of RT directed at metastatic sites of disease as part of consolidation. All patients with neuroblastoma who received RT to metastatic sites of disease as a part of consolidative therapy at a single institution between 2000 and 2015 were reviewed. Among 159 patients, 244 metastases were irradiated. The median follow-up period among surviving patients was 7.4 years. Over 85% of the irradiated metastases were treated with 21 Gy (range, 10.5-36 Gy). Tumor recurrence occurred in 43 of 244 irradiated metastases (18%). The 5-year LC rate of treated metastatic sites was 81%. Metastatic sites that cleared with induction chemotherapy had improved LC compared with sites with persistent uptake on metaiodobenzylguanidine scans (LC rate, 92% vs 67%; P < .0001). LC at irradiated metastatic sites did not differ based on total number of sites irradiated or site of disease irradiated (bone vs soft tissue). Patients with bulky, resistant disease who were treated with 30 to 36 Gy had worse LC (P = .02). However, on multivariate analysis, only persistence after induction chemotherapy remained a significant prognostic factor for LC (hazard ratio, 3.7; P < .0001). Patients who had LC at irradiated metastatic sites had improved overall survival compared with those who did not (overall survival rate, 71% vs 50%; P < .0001).

Dose-escalation is needed for gross disease in high-risk neuroblastoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2018-02-22,"Locoregional failure is common after subtotal resection in high-risk neuroblastoma. Although a dose of 21 Gy radiation therapy (RT) is standard for treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma after gross total resection, the dose needed for local control of patients with gross residual disease at the time of RT is unknown. We sought to evaluate local control after 21-36 Gy RT in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma undergoing subtotal resection. All patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who received RT to their primary site from 2000 to 2016 were reviewed. Of the 331 patients who received consolidative RT to their primary site, 19 (5.7%) underwent subtotal resection and were included in our analysis. Local failure (LF) was correlated with biologic prognostic factors and dose of RT. Median follow-up among surviving patients was 6.0 years. Median RT dose was 25 Gy (range, 21 Gy-36 Gy). The 5-year cumulative incidence of LF among all patients was 17.2%. LF at 5 years was 30% in those who received <30 Gy versus 0% in those who received 30-36 Gy (P = 0.12). There was a trend towards improved local control in patients with tumor size ≤10 cm at diagnosis (P = 0.12). The 5-year event-free and overall survival were 44.9% and 68.7%, respectively.

We conducted a phase I trial in children with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of vorinostat on an interrupted schedule, escalating beyond the previously identified pediatric MTD. Isotretinoin (cis-13-retinoic acid) 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> /dose was administered by mouth twice daily on days 1-14 in combination with escalating doses of daily vorinostat up to 430 mg/m<sup>2</sup> /dose (days 1-4; 8-11) in each 28-day cycle using the standard 3 + 3 design. Vorinostat pharmacokinetic testing and histone acetylation assays were performed. Twenty-nine patients with refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma were enrolled and 28 were evaluable for dose escalation decisions. Median number of cycles completed was two (range 1-15); 11 patients received four or more cycles. Three patients experienced cycle 1 dose-limiting toxicities. A total of 18 patients experienced grade 3/4 toxicities related to study therapy. The maximum intended dose of vorinostat (430 mg/m<sup>2</sup> /day, days 1-4; 8-11) was tolerable and led to increased histone acetylation in surrogate tissues when compared to lower doses of vorinostat (P = 0.009). No objective responses were seen. Increased dose vorinostat (430 mg/m<sup>2</sup> /day) on an interrupted schedule is tolerable in combination with isotretinoin. This dose led to increased vorinostat exposures and demonstrated increased histone acetylation. Prolonged stable disease in patients with minimal residual disease warrants further investigation.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",662.0,4.0,Vorinostat combined with retinoids produces additive antitumor effects in preclinical studies of Higher systemic exposures of vorinostat than achieved in pediatric phase I trials with continuous daily dosing are necessary for in vivo increased histone acetylation and cytotoxic activity We conducted a phase I trial in children with relapsed/refractory to determine the maximum tolerated dose MTD of vorinostat on an interrupted schedule escalating beyond the previously identified pediatric MTD Isotretinoin cis-13-retinoic acid 80 mg/m sup 2 /sup /dose was administered by mouth twice daily on days 1-14 in combination with escalating doses of daily vorinostat up to 430 mg/m sup 2 /sup /dose days 1-4 8-11 in each 28-day cycle using the standard 3 3 design Vorinostat pharmacokinetic testing and histone acetylation assays were performed Twenty-nine patients with refractory or relapsed were enrolled and 28 were evaluable for dose escalation decisions Median number of cycles completed was two range 1-15 11 patients received four or more cycles Three patients experienced cycle 1 dose-limiting toxicities A total of 18 patients experienced grade 3/4 toxicities related to study therapy The maximum intended dose of vorinostat 430 mg/m sup 2 /sup /day days 1-4 8-11 was tolerable and led to increased histone acetylation in surrogate tissues when compared to lower doses of vorinostat P 0.009 No objective responses were seen Increased dose vorinostat 430 mg/m sup 2 /sup /day on an interrupted schedule is tolerable in combination with isotretinoin This dose led to increased vorinostat exposures and demonstrated increased histone acetylation Prolonged stable disease in patients with minimal residual disease warrants further investigation,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2371, 397, 5, 7358, 4042, 3396, 579, 176, 4, 693, 94, 1, 142, 403, 3401, 1, 2371, 76, 513, 4, 815, 124, 70, 143, 5, 1314, 391, 1280, 32, 1493, 9, 4, 386, 101, 1508, 4145, 2, 759, 128, 21, 426, 8, 124, 70, 160, 4, 541, 5, 591, 430, 6, 223, 3, 689, 421, 61, 961, 1, 2371, 23, 35, 12981, 1055, 2922, 1654, 3, 373, 108, 815, 961, 13320, 1927, 233, 3887, 971, 493, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 61, 10, 468, 20, 5831, 936, 391, 23, 162, 14, 213, 4, 150, 5, 2922, 415, 1, 391, 2371, 126, 6, 10083, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 61, 162, 14, 39, 66, 175, 4, 296, 339, 218, 417, 75, 3, 260, 27, 27, 771, 2371, 1456, 471, 2, 1508, 4145, 1013, 11, 173, 737, 762, 7, 5, 430, 15, 591, 11, 346, 2, 339, 11, 859, 9, 61, 1125, 1526, 52, 207, 1, 410, 781, 10, 100, 184, 14, 167, 175, 7, 103, 294, 15, 80, 410, 169, 7, 592, 417, 14, 61, 817, 385, 8, 181, 1, 203, 7, 592, 88, 27, 39, 385, 139, 6, 45, 36, 3, 689, 4081, 61, 1, 2371, 10083, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 218, 162, 14, 39, 66, 175, 10, 2668, 2, 836, 6, 101, 1508, 4145, 4, 2592, 742, 198, 72, 6, 280, 415, 1, 2371, 19, 13, 2376, 77, 461, 253, 11, 527, 101, 61, 2371, 10083, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 218, 23, 35, 12981, 1055, 16, 2668, 4, 150, 5, 13320, 26, 61, 836, 6, 101, 2371, 3401, 2, 264, 101, 1508, 4145, 1069, 585, 34, 4, 7, 5, 1048, 753, 34, 2782, 195, 940]",1746.0,29603591,175

DNA methylation-based reclassification of olfactory neuroblastoma.,Acta neuropathologica,Acta Neuropathol.,2018-05-05,"Olfactory neuroblastoma/esthesioneuroblastoma (ONB) is an uncommon neuroectodermal neoplasm thought to arise from the olfactory epithelium. Little is known about its molecular pathogenesis. For this study, a retrospective cohort of n = 66 tumor samples with the institutional diagnosis of ONB was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, genome-wide DNA methylation profiling, copy number analysis, and in a subset, next-generation panel sequencing of 560 tumor-associated genes. DNA methylation profiles were compared to those of relevant differential diagnoses of ONB. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of DNA methylation data revealed four subgroups among institutionally diagnosed ONB. The largest group (n = 42, 64%, Core ONB) presented with classical ONB histology and no overlap with other classes upon methylation profiling-based t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis. A second DNA methylation group (n = 7, 11%) with CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) consisted of cases with strong expression of cytokeratin, no or scarce chromogranin A expression and IDH2 hotspot mutation in all cases. T-SNE analysis clustered these cases together with sinonasal carcinoma with IDH2 mutation. Four cases (6%) formed a small group characterized by an overall high level of DNA methylation, but without CIMP. The fourth group consisted of 13 cases that had heterogeneous DNA methylation profiles and strong cytokeratin expression in most cases. In t-SNE analysis, these cases mostly grouped among sinonasal adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and undifferentiated carcinoma. Copy number analysis indicated highly recurrent chromosomal changes among Core ONB with a high frequency of combined loss of chromosome 1-4, 8-10, and 12. NGS sequencing did not reveal highly recurrent mutations in ONB, with the only recurrently mutated genes being TP53 and DNMT3A. In conclusion, we demonstrate that institutionally diagnosed ONB are a heterogeneous group of tumors.

Long-term psychological and educational outcomes for survivors of neuroblastoma: A report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,Cancer,Cancer,2018-06-11,"Neuroblastoma survivors may be at elevated risk for psychological impairments because of their young age at diagnosis and neurotoxic treatment, but this is not well described. A total of 859 ≥5-year survivors of neuroblastoma younger than 18 years (diagnosed in 1970-1999), who had a median age at diagnosis of 0.8 years (range: 0.0-7.3 years) and a median follow-up of 13.3 years (range: 8.0-17.9 years), were compared with 872 siblings of childhood cancer survivors who were younger than 18 years with the parent-reported Behavior Problem Index (BPI) for psychological functioning. Age- and sex-adjusted multivariate log-binomial models were used to identify factors associated with impairment in BPI domains (scores worse than the sibling 10th percentile). The impact of psychological impairment on educational outcomes was examined among survivors. Compared with siblings, neuroblastoma survivors had an increased prevalence of impairment in the domains of anxiety/depression (19% vs 14%; P = .003), headstrong behavior (19% vs 13%; P < .001), attention deficits (21% vs 13%; P < .001), peer conflict/social withdrawal (26% vs 17%; P < .001), and antisocial behavior (16% vs 12%; P = .01). Common treatment exposures (vincristine, cisplatin, and retinoic acid) were not associated with impairment. Having 2 or more chronic health conditions predicted impairment in 4 domains (P < .001). Specifically, pulmonary disease predicted impairment in all 5 domains (P ≤ .004). Endocrine disease (P ≤ .004) and peripheral neuropathy (P ≤ .02) each predicted impairment in 3 domains. Psychological impairment was associated with special education service usage and educational attainment less than college.

Short Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy in Palliation of Pediatric Malignancies: Outcomes and Toxicities.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2018-08-02,"Treatment strategies in palliation of pediatric cancer remain a significant challenge. In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of a short course of hypofractionated radiation therapy (RT) for metastatic or recurrent childhood tumors. A total of 104 lesions in 62 pediatric patients with metastatic or recurrent cancer were treated with a short hypofractionation schedule (>1 but ≤5 fractions; ≥3 Gy per fraction) between 2007 and 2017 in our institution. The primary endpoint was local control (LC). Other endpoints included treatment response, overall survival, progression-free survival, and toxicity. Toxicities were assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.4.0. The most common histologies were neuroblastoma, comprising 50 of the 104 lesions (48.1%); osteosarcoma, 17 lesions (16.4%); and Ewing sarcoma, 13 lesions (12.5%). A median total dose of 24 Gy was delivered in a median of 5 fractions. Of 104 lesions, 26 (25.0%) were treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy, 24 (23.1%) with intensity modulated RT, and 48 (46.2%) with 2-dimensional RT or 3-dimensional conformal RT. A complete or partial response was observed in 63 (60.6%) of lesions, and stable disease was observed in 34 (32.7%). At a median follow-up of 8.7 months, 21 local failures occurred (20.2%). The 1- and 2-year LC rates were 74% and 68%, respectively. LC was better for tumors without previous irradiation (83% vs 57% with previous RT; P = .004). LC rates did not differ between RT techniques or total biologically effective dose with α/β ratio of 10 (BED10) (≤30 vs >30 Gy). At the time of analysis, 38 deaths in the cohort of 62 patients (61.3%) were recorded. The 1-year progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 31% and 44%, respectively. Incidence of any grade ≥3 toxicity was 6.7% (7 of 104). No grade 5 events occurred. A short hypofractionation scheme yields effective disease control and treatment response with a favorable side effect profile.

Phase II Trial of Alisertib in Combination with Irinotecan and Temozolomide for Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Neuroblastoma.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2018-08-09,"In phase I testing, alisertib tablets with irinotecan and temozolomide showed significant antitumor activity in patients with neuroblastoma. This study sought to confirm activity of this regimen; evaluate an alisertib oral solution; and evaluate biomarkers of clinical outcomes. We conducted a two-stage phase II trial of alisertib tablets (60 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/dose × 7 days), irinotecan (50 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/dose i.v. × 5 days), and temozolomide (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/dose orally × 5 days) in patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma. The primary endpoint was best objective response. A separate cohort was treated with alisertib at 45 mg/m<sup>2</sup> using oral solution instead of tablets. Exploratory analyses sought to identify predictors of toxicity, response, and progression-free survival (PFS) using pooled data from phase I, phase II, and oral solution cohorts. Twenty and 12 eligible patients were treated in the phase II and oral solution cohorts, respectively. Hematologic toxicities were the most common adverse events. In phase II, partial responses were observed in 19 evaluable patients (21%). The estimated PFS at 1 year was 34%. In the oral solution cohort, 3 patients (25%) had first cycle dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Alisertib oral solution at 45 mg/m<sup>2</sup> had significantly higher median <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> and exposure compared with tablets at 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup>.

Robust prediction of response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy in metastatic melanoma.,Nature medicine,Nat. Med.,2018-08-20,"Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy provides remarkable clinical gains and has been very successful in treatment of melanoma. However, only a subset of patients with advanced tumors currently benefit from ICB therapies, which at times incur considerable side effects and costs. Constructing predictors of patient response has remained a serious challenge because of the complexity of the immune response and the shortage of large cohorts of ICB-treated patients that include both 'omics' and response data. Here we build immuno-predictive score (IMPRES), a predictor of ICB response in melanoma which encompasses 15 pairwise transcriptomics relations between immune checkpoint genes. It is based on two key conjectures: (i) immune mechanisms underlying spontaneous regression in neuroblastoma can predict melanoma response to ICB, and (ii) key immune interactions can be captured via specific pairwise relations of the expression of immune checkpoint genes. IMPRES is validated on nine published datasets<sup>1-6</sup> and on a newly generated dataset with 31 patients treated with anti-PD-1 and 10 with anti-CTLA-4, spanning 297 samples in total. It achieves an overall accuracy of AUC = 0.83, outperforming existing predictors and capturing almost all true responders while misclassifying less than half of the nonresponders.

Assessing the feasibility and validity of the Toronto Childhood Cancer Stage Guidelines: a population-based registry study.,The Lancet. Child & adolescent health,Lancet Child Adolesc Health,2018-02-01,"Cancer stage at diagnosis is crucial for assessing global efforts to increase awareness of childhood cancer and improve outcomes. However, consistent information on childhood cancer stage is absent from population cancer registries worldwide. The Toronto Childhood Cancer Stage Guidelines, compiled through an international consensus process, were designed to provide a standard framework for collection of information on stage at diagnosis of childhood cancers. We aimed to assess the feasibility of implementing the Toronto Guidelines within a national population cancer registry. We did a population-based registry study using data from the Australian Childhood Cancer Registry and included data from children aged 0-14 years diagnosed between Jan 1, 2006, and Dec 31, 2010 with one of 16 childhood cancers listed in the Toronto Guidelines (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumour, rhabdomyosarcoma, non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, retinoblastoma, hepatoblastoma, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, medulloblastoma, and ependymoma). We extracted data from medical records, and assigned stage according to the Tier 1 criteria (basic) and Tier 2 criteria (more detailed, requiring data from cytology, imaging, and other diagnostic tests, where available) using computer algorithms derived from the Toronto Guidelines. Additionally, expert reviewers independently assigned Tier 2 stage to a random subsample of 160 cases (ten per malignancy type). Feasibility of the guidelines was assessed on the percentage of cases that could be staged, agreement between stage assigned by the algorithms and the expert reviewers, and the mean time (min) taken to collect the required data. We obtained data for 1412 eligible children. Stage could be assigned according to Tier 2 criteria for 1318 (93%) cases, ranging from 48 (84%) of 57 cases of non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma to 46 (100%) cases of hepatoblastoma. According to Tier 1 criteria, stage could be assigned for 1329 (94%) cases, ranging from 131 (87%) of 151 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia to 46 (100%) cases of hepatoblastoma. By contrast, stage at diagnosis was recorded by the treating physician for 555 (39%) of the 1412 cases. The computer algorithm assigned the same stage as did one or more independent expert reviewers in 155 (97%) of the 160 cases assessed. The mean time taken to review medical records and extract the required data was 18·0 min (SD 9·5 per case). The Toronto Guidelines provide a highly functional framework that can be used to assign cancer stage at diagnosis using data routinely available in medical records for most childhood cancers. Data on staging have the potential to inform interventions targeting improved diagnosis and survival.

Managing local-regional failure in children with high-risk neuroblastoma: A single institution experience.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2018-09-30,"Intensification of systemic therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma (HRNB) has resulted in improved local control and overall survival (OS) leaving potential for de-escalation of primary site radiotherapy. The utility of primary site de-escalation should be evaluated in the context of potential for successful local-regional salvage. We evaluated salvage strategies and outcomes in patients with HRNB with local-regional recurrence as a component of first failure. Twenty of 89 patients with HRNB experienced local-regional recurrence as a component of first relapse after chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, and stem cell transplant from 1997 to 2013. We reviewed salvage therapy strategies and disease control, and report on the impact of local therapy as salvage for local-regional relapse. Six of 20 patients with local-regional failure (LRF) were alive after a median follow-up of 13 years (range, 0.9-25.2 years). Median OS was 4.6 years (95% CI, 0.6 to not reached) versus 0.6 years (95% CI, 0.05-2.6) after LRF with and without distant failure, respectively (P = 0.03). OS in patients receiving salvage radiotherapy was comparable to those receiving initial adjuvant but no salvage radiotherapy.

Humanized 3F8 Anti-GD2 Monoclonal Antibody Dosing With Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor in Patients With Resistant Neuroblastoma: A Phase 1 Clinical Trial.,JAMA oncology,JAMA Oncol,2018-12-01,"Chimeric and murine anti-GD2 antibodies are active against neuroblastoma, but the development of neutralizing antibodies can compromise efficacy. To decrease immunogenicity, hu3F8, a humanized anti-GD2 antibody, was constructed. To find the maximum-tolerated dose of hu3F8 with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. This phase 1 clinical trial used a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design in a single referral center (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York). Participants were enrolled from December 24, 2012, through May 3, 2016, with follow-up and analyses through February 28, 2018. Eligibility criteria included older than 1 year and resistant or recurrent neuroblastoma regardless of the number or kinds of prior treatments. All 57 participants met the eligibility criteria, received treatment according to the protocol, and were included in all analyses. Treatment cycles were monthly, if human antihuman antibody remained negative. Each cycle comprised hu3F8 infused intravenously for 30 minutes on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday as well as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor administered subcutaneously daily from 5 days before infusion through the last day of infusion. After cycle 2, hu3F8 was increased to the highest dose level that had been confirmed as safe. Toxicity, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and disease response. Of the 57 participants, 34 (60%) were male and 23 (40%) were female (male-to-female ratio of 1.5), with a median (range) age of 6.8 (2.4-31.3) years at enrollment and a median (range) time of 3.1 (0.6-9.0) years since initial chemotherapy. Participants received a median (range) of 4 (1-15) cycles. Treatment was outpatient with reversible neuropathic pain and without unexpected toxic effects. No maximum-tolerated dose was identified. Dose escalation was associated with increased serum levels and proceeded through dosage of 9.6 mg/kg/cycle (approximately 288 mg/m2), which is more than 2.5 times higher than the standard dosage of 75 mg/m2/cycle or 100 mg/m2/cycle of dinutuximab and m3F8. Human antihuman antibody positivity developed in 5 of 57 patients (9%) after cycle 1, including in 1 of 10 patients (10%) not previously treated with anti-GD2 antibody and in 4 of 47 patients (9%) previously exposed to 1 or 2 anti-GD2 antibodies. Antineuroblastoma activity included major responses associated with higher dosing and prolonged progression-free survival despite a history of relapses. This phase 1 clinical trial found hu3F8 to be associated with modest toxic effects, low immunogenicity, and substantial antineuroblastoma activity; phase 2 trials are in progress.

Temporal patterns in the risk of chronic health conditions in survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed 1970-99: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort.,The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2018-11-08,"Treatments for childhood cancer have evolved over the past 50 years, with the goal of maximising the proportion of patients who achieve long-term survival, while minimising the adverse effects of therapy. We aimed to assess incidence patterns of serious chronic health conditions in long-term survivors of childhood cancer across three decades of diagnosis and treatment. We used data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, a retrospective cohort with longitudinal follow-up of 5-year survivors of common childhood cancers (leukaemia, tumours of the CNS, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Wilms tumour, neuroblastoma, soft tissue sarcoma, or bone tumours) who were diagnosed before the age of 21 years and from 1970 to 1999 in North America. We examined the cumulative incidence of severe to fatal chronic health conditions occurring up to 20 years post-diagnosis among survivors, compared by diagnosis decade. We used multivariable regression models to estimate hazard ratios per diagnosis decade, and we added treatment variables to assess whether treatment changes attenuated associations between diagnosis decade and chronic disease risk. Among 23 601 survivors with a median follow-up of 21 years (IQR 15-25), the 20-year cumulative incidence of at least one grade 3-5 chronic condition decreased significantly from 33·2% (95% CI 32·0-34·3) in those diagnosed 1970-79 to 29·3% (28·4-30·2; p<0·0001) in 1980-89, and 27·5% (26·4-28·6; p=0·012 vs 1980-89) in 1990-99. By comparison, the 20-year cumulative incidence of at least one grade 3-5 condition in 5051 siblings was 4·6% (95% CI 3·9-5·2). The 15-year cumulative incidence of at least one grade 3-5 condition was lower for survivors diagnosed 1990-99 compared with those diagnosed 1970-79 for Hodgkin lymphoma (17·7% [95% CI 15·0-20·5] vs 26·4% [23·8-29·1]; p<0·0001), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (16·9% [14·0-19·7] vs 23·8% [19·9-27·7]; p=0.0053), astrocytoma (30·5% [27·8-33·2] vs 47·3% [42·9-51·7]; p<0·0001), Wilms tumour (11·9% [9·5-14·3] vs 17·6% [14·3-20·8]; p=0·034), soft tissue sarcoma (28·3% [23·5-33·1] vs 36·5% [31·5-41·4]; p=0·021), and osteosarcoma (65·6% [60·6-70·6] vs 87·5% [84·1-91·0]; p<0·0001). By contrast, the 15-year cumulative incidence of at least one grade 3-5 condition was higher (1990-99 vs 1970-79) for medulloblastoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumour (58·9% [54·4-63·3] vs 42·9% [34·9-50·9]; p=0·00060), and neuroblastoma (25·0% [21·8-28·2] vs 18·0% [14·5-21·6]; p=0·0045). Results were consistent with changes in treatment as a significant mediator of the association between diagnosis decade and risk of grade 3-5 chronic conditions for astrocytoma (HR per decade without treatment in the model = 0·77, 95% CI 0·64-0·92; HR with treatment in the model=0·89, 95% CI 0·72-1·11; p<sub>mediation</sub>=0·0085) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HR without treatment=0·75, 95% CI 0·65-0·85; HR with treatment=0·91, 95% CI 0·73-1·12; p<sub>mediation</sub>=0·024). Temporal decreases in 15-year cumulative incidence comparing survivors diagnosed 1970-79 to survivors diagnosed 1990-99 were noted for endocrinopathies (5·9% [5·3-6·4] vs 2·8% [2·5-3·2]; p<0·0001), subsequent malignant neoplasms (2·7% [2·3-3·1] vs 1·9% [1·6-2·2]; p=0·0033), musculoskeletal conditions (5·8% [5·2-6·4] vs 3·3% [2·9-3·6]; p<0·0001), and gastrointestinal conditions (2·3% [2·0-2·7] vs 1·5% [1·3-1·8]; p=0·00037), while hearing loss increased (3·0% [2·6-3·5] vs 5·7% [5·2-6·1]; p<0·0001). Our results suggest that more recently treated survivors of childhood cancer had improvements in health outcomes, consistent with efforts over the same time period to modify childhood cancer treatment regimens to maximise overall survival, while reducing risk of long-term adverse events. Continuing advances in cancer therapy offer promise of further reducing the risk of long-term adverse events in childhood cancer survivors. However, achieving long-term survival for childhood cancer continues to come at a cost for many survivors, emphasising the importance of long-term follow-up care for this population.

Theranostic pretargeted radioimmunotherapy of internalizing solid tumor antigens in human tumor xenografts in mice: Curative treatment of HER2-positive breast carcinoma.,Theranostics,Theranostics,2018-10-06,"In recent reports, we have shown that optimized pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (PRIT) based on molecularly engineered antibody conjugates and <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA chelate (DOTA-PRIT) can be used to cure mice bearing human solid tumor xenografts using antitumor antibodies to minimally internalizing membrane antigens, GPA33 (colon) and GD2 (neuroblastoma). However, many solid tumor membrane antigens are internalized after antibody binding and it is generally believed that internalizing tumor membrane antigens are not suitable targets for PRIT. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that DOTA-PRIT can be performed successfully to target HER2, an internalizing membrane antigen widely expressed in breast, ovarian, and gastroesophageal junction cancers. <b>Methods:</b> DOTA-PRIT was carried out in athymic nude mice bearing BT-474 xenografts, a HER2-expressing human breast cancer, using a three-step dosing regimen consisting of sequential intravenous administrations of: 1) a bispecific IgG-scFv (210 kD) format (BsAb) carrying the IgG sequence of the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab and the scFv ""C825"" with high-affinity, hapten-binding antibody for Bn-DOTA (metal) (BsAb: anti-HER2-C825), 2) a 500 kD dextran-based clearing agent, followed by 3) <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA-Bn. At the time of treatment, athymic nude mice bearing established subcutaneous BT-474 tumors (medium- and smaller-sized tumors with tumor volumes of 209 ± 101 mm<sup>3</sup> and ranging from palpable to 30 mm<sup>3</sup>, respectively), were studied along with controls. We studied single- and multi-dose regimens. For groups receiving fractionated treatment, we verified quantitative tumor targeting during each treatment cycle using non-invasive imaging with single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT). <b>Results:</b> We achieved high therapeutic indices (TI, the ratio of radiation-absorbed dose in tumor to radiation-absorbed dose to critical organs, such as bone marrow) for targeting in blood (TI = 28) and kidney (TI = 7), while delivering average radiation-absorbed doses of 39.9 cGy/MBq to tumor. Based on dosimetry estimates, we implemented a curative fractionated therapeutic regimen for medium-sized tumors that would deliver approximately 70 Gy to tumors, which required treatment with a total of 167 MBq <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA-Bn/mouse (estimated absorbed tumor dose: 66 Gy). This regimen was well tolerated and achieved 100% complete responses (CRs; defined herein as tumor volume equal to or smaller than 4.2 mm<sup>3</sup>), including 62.5% histologic cure (5/8) and 37.5% microscopic residual disease (3/8) at 85 days (d). Treatment controls showed tumor progression to 207 ± 201% of pre-treatment volume at 85 d and no CRs. Finally, we show that treatment with this curative <sup>177</sup>Lu regimen leads to a very low incidence of histopathologic abnormalities in critical organs such as bone marrow and kidney among survivors compared with non-treated controls. <b>Conclusion:</b> Contrary to popular belief, we demonstrate that DOTA-PRIT can be successfully adapted to an internalizing antigen-antibody system such as HER2, with sufficient TIs and absorbed tumor doses to achieve a high probability of cures of established human breast cancer xenografts while sparing critical organs of significant

Defining Risk Factors for Chemotherapeutic Intervention in Infants With Stage 4S Neuroblastoma: A Report From Children's Oncology Group Study ANBL0531.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2018-11-16,"Infants with stage 4S neuroblastoma usually have favorable outcomes with observation or minimal chemotherapy. However, young infants with symptoms secondary to massive hepatomegaly or with unfavorable tumor biology are at high risk of death. Our aim was to improve outcomes for patients with symptomatic and/or unfavorable biology 4S neuroblastoma with a uniform treatment approach using a biology- and response-based algorithm. The subset of patients with 4S disease with MYCN-not amplified tumors with impaired or impending organ dysfunction, or with unfavorable histology and/or diploid DNA index, were eligible. Patients were assigned to receive two, four, or eight cycles of chemotherapy on the basis of histology, diploid DNA index, chromosome arm 1p or 11q loss of heterozygosity (LOH) status, and symptoms. Forty-nine eligible patients were enrolled: 41 were symptomatic and 28 had unfavorable biology. Seventeen patients (symptomatic, favorable biology) were assigned two cycles, 21 patients (any unfavorable biologic feature without 1p or 11q LOH) were assigned four cycles, and 11 patients (unfavorable biology including 1p and/or 11q LOH [n = 7] or symptomatic with unknown biology [n = 4]), were assigned eight cycles. The 3-year overall survival was 81.4% ± 5.8%. Eight of nine deaths were in patients younger than 2 months of age at diagnosis (median, 9 days [range, 1 to 68 days]): five acute deaths were a result of hepatomegaly and associated toxicities; two were a result of late relapse in patients with unfavorable biology; and two were a result of treatment complications. No deaths occurred after protocol-mandated pre-emptive treatment of infants younger than 2 months with hepatomegaly, regardless of symptoms.

Reduced-Dose Radiation Therapy to the Primary Site is Effective for High-Risk Neuroblastoma: Results From a Prospective Trial.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2019-02-11,"For patients with high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NB), a dose of 21 Gy to the primary tumor site after gross total resection (GTR) provides excellent local control. However, no clinical trial has specifically evaluated the optimal dose of radiation therapy (RT), and RT-related long-term toxicities are of increasing concern. We sought to assess local control, survival outcomes, and toxicity after a reduction in dose to the primary site from 21 Gy to 18 Gy. After induction chemotherapy and GTR, patients with HR-NB were enrolled and treated on an RT dose-reduction prospective trial with 18 Gy hyperfractionated RT given in twice-daily fractions of 1.5 Gy each. The 25 study subjects were 1.6 to 9.5 (median, 4.3) years old at enrollment and included 23 (92%) with stage IV and II (8%) with MYCN-amplified stage III disease. Eleven (44%) were in complete remission (CR), and 14 (56%) had persistence of osteomedullary disease postinduction. Three patients (12%) received proton therapy, and the rest received intensity modulated photon therapy. After a follow-up of 1.8 to 4.2 (median, 3.5) years from initiation of RT, no failures occurred within the RT field; 3 patients had marginal recurrences. The respective 3-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 54.5% and 90.9% for patients in first CR and 42.9% and 76.2% for patients not in metastatic CR. Acute toxicity was negligible. Reduced-dose RT with 18 Gy did not compromise local control or survival outcomes in our cohort of patients with HR-NB after GTR. These findings support assessing further RT dose reduction and validation on a larger, multi-institutional trial.",Journal Article,344.0,0.0,For patients with high-risk HR-NB a dose of 21 Gy to the primary tumor site after gross total resection GTR provides excellent local control However no clinical trial has specifically evaluated the optimal dose of radiation therapy RT and RT-related long-term toxicities are of increasing concern We sought to assess local control survival outcomes and toxicity after a reduction in dose to the primary site from 21 Gy to 18 Gy After induction chemotherapy and GTR patients with HR-NB were enrolled and treated on an RT dose-reduction prospective trial with 18 Gy hyperfractionated RT given in twice-daily fractions of 1.5 Gy each The 25 study subjects were 1.6 to 9.5 median 4.3 years old at enrollment and included 23 92 with stage IV and II 8 with MYCN-amplified stage III disease Eleven 44 were in complete remission CR and 14 56 had persistence of osteomedullary disease postinduction Three patients 12 received proton therapy and the rest received intensity modulated photon therapy After a follow-up of 1.8 to 4.2 median 3.5 years from initiation of RT no failures occurred within the RT field 3 patients had marginal recurrences The respective 3-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 54.5 and 90.9 for patients in first CR and 42.9 and 76.2 for patients not in metastatic CR Acute toxicity was negligible Reduced-dose RT with 18 Gy did not compromise local control or survival outcomes in our cohort of patients with HR-NB after GTR These findings support assessing further RT dose reduction and validation on a larger multi-institutional trial,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[9, 7, 5, 64, 43, 168, 3446, 8, 61, 1, 239, 381, 6, 3, 86, 30, 606, 50, 1789, 181, 170, 4833, 777, 1503, 293, 182, 137, 77, 38, 160, 71, 1225, 194, 3, 665, 61, 1, 121, 36, 240, 2, 240, 139, 319, 337, 385, 32, 1, 602, 2893, 21, 990, 6, 423, 293, 182, 25, 123, 2, 155, 50, 8, 628, 4, 61, 6, 3, 86, 606, 29, 239, 381, 6, 203, 381, 50, 504, 56, 2, 4833, 7, 5, 168, 3446, 11, 346, 2, 73, 23, 35, 240, 61, 628, 482, 160, 5, 203, 381, 6201, 240, 447, 4, 936, 391, 1550, 1, 14, 33, 381, 296, 3, 243, 45, 976, 11, 14, 49, 6, 83, 33, 52, 39, 27, 60, 1095, 28, 1798, 2, 159, 382, 937, 5, 82, 478, 2, 215, 66, 5, 4068, 2429, 82, 316, 34, 2627, 584, 11, 4, 236, 734, 684, 2, 213, 664, 42, 4108, 1, 22489, 34, 12543, 169, 7, 133, 103, 2095, 36, 2, 3, 3677, 103, 837, 1757, 4216, 36, 50, 8, 166, 126, 1, 14, 66, 6, 39, 18, 52, 27, 33, 60, 29, 1118, 1, 240, 77, 3368, 489, 262, 3, 240, 1067, 27, 7, 42, 3450, 1593, 3, 3847, 27, 111, 91, 115, 2, 63, 25, 151, 11, 667, 33, 2, 424, 83, 9, 7, 4, 157, 684, 2, 595, 83, 2, 846, 18, 9, 7, 44, 4, 113, 684, 286, 155, 10, 6821, 405, 61, 240, 5, 203, 381, 205, 44, 4665, 293, 182, 15, 25, 123, 4, 114, 180, 1, 7, 5, 168, 3446, 50, 4833, 46, 272, 538, 1977, 195, 240, 61, 628, 2, 929, 23, 8, 1077, 1414, 1115, 160]",1568.0,30763661,111
Stage at diagnosis for childhood solid cancers in Australia: A population-based study.,Cancer epidemiology,Cancer Epidemiol,2019-03-01,"Stage of cancer at diagnosis is one of the strongest predictors of survival and is essential for population cancer surveillance, comparison of cancer outcomes and to guide national cancer control strategies. Our aim was to describe, for the first time, the distribution of cases by stage at diagnosis and differences in stage-specific survival on a population basis for a range of childhood solid cancers in Australia. The study cohort was drawn from the population-based Australian Childhood Cancer Registry and comprised children (<15 years) diagnosed with one of 12 solid malignancies between 2006 and 2014. Stage at diagnosis was assigned according to the Toronto Paediatric Cancer Stage Guidelines. Observed (all cause) survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with follow-up on mortality available to 31 December 2015. Almost three-quarters (1256 of 1760 cases, 71%) of children in the study had localised or regional disease at diagnosis, varying from 43% for neuroblastoma to 99% for retinoblastoma. Differences in 5-year observed survival by stage were greatest for osteosarcoma (localised 85% (95% CI = 72%-93%) versus metastatic 37% (15%-59%)), neuroblastoma (localised 98% (91%-99%) versus metastatic 60% (52%-67%)), rhabdomyosarcoma (localised 85% (71%-93%) versus metastatic 53% (34%-69%)), and medulloblastoma (localised 69% (61%-75%) versus metastases to spine 42% (27%-57%)).

Role of the extent of prophylactic regional lymph node radiotherapy on survival in high-risk neuroblastoma: A report from the COG A3973 study.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2019-04-09,"Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid pediatric malignancy, with poor outcomes in high-risk disease. Standard treatment approaches employ an increasing array of aggressive multimodal therapies, of which local control with surgery and radiotherapy remains a backbone; however, the benefit of broad regional nodal irradiation remains controversial. We analyzed centrally reviewed radiation therapy data from patients enrolled on COG A3973 to evaluate the impact of primary site irradiation and the extent of regional nodal coverage stratified by extent of surgical resection. Three hundred thirty high-risk neuroblastoma patients with centrally reviewed radiotherapy plans were analyzed. Outcome was evaluated by the extent of nodal irradiation. For the 171 patients who also underwent surgery (centrally reviewed), outcome was likewise analyzed according to the extent of resection. Overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and cumulative incidence of local progression (CILP) were examined by Kaplan-Meier, log-rank test (EFS, OS), and Grey test (CILP).

Telomere Trimming and DNA Damage as Signatures of High Risk Neuroblastoma.,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",Neoplasia,2019-05-23,"Telomeres play important roles in genome stability and cell proliferation. High risk neuroblastoma (HRNB), an aggressive childhood cancer, is especially reliant on telomere maintenance. Three recurrent genetic aberrations in HRNB (MYCN amplification, TERT re-arrangements, and ATRX mutations) are mutually exclusive and each capable of promoting telomere maintenance mechanisms (i.e., through telomerase or ALT). We analyzed a panel of 5 representative HRNB cell lines and 30 HRNB surgical samples using assays that assess average telomere lengths, length distribution patterns, single-stranded DNA on the G- and C-strand, as well as extra-chromosomal circular telomeres. Our analysis pointed to substantial and variable degrees of telomere DNA damage in HRNB, including pervasive oxidative lesions. Moreover, unlike other cancers, neuroblastoma consistently harbored high levels of C-strand ssDNA overhangs and t-circles, which are consistent with active ""telomere trimming"". This feature is observed in both telomerase- and ALT-positive tumors and irrespective of telomere length distribution. Moreover, evidence for telomere trimming was detected in normal neural tissues, raising the possibility that TMMs in HRNB evolved in the face of a canonical developmental program of telomere shortening. Telomere trimming by itself appears to distinguish neuroectodermal derived tumors from other human cancers, a distinguishing characteristic with both biologic and therapeutic implications.",Journal Article,243.0,0.0,Telomeres play important roles in genome stability and cell proliferation High risk HRNB an aggressive childhood cancer is especially reliant on telomere maintenance Three recurrent genetic aberrations in HRNB MYCN amplification TERT re-arrangements and ATRX mutations are mutually exclusive and each capable of promoting telomere maintenance mechanisms i.e. through telomerase or ALT We analyzed a panel of 5 representative HRNB cell lines and 30 HRNB surgical samples using assays that assess average telomere lengths length distribution patterns single-stranded DNA on the G- and C-strand as well as extra-chromosomal circular telomeres Our analysis pointed to substantial and variable degrees of telomere DNA damage in HRNB including pervasive oxidative lesions Moreover unlike other cancers consistently harbored high levels of C-strand ssDNA overhangs and t-circles which are consistent with active `` telomere trimming '' This feature is observed in both telomerase- and ALT-positive tumors and irrespective of telomere length distribution Moreover evidence for telomere trimming was detected in normal neural tissues raising the possibility that TMMs in HRNB evolved in the face of a canonical developmental program of telomere shortening Telomere trimming by itself appears to distinguish neuroectodermal derived tumors from other human cancers a distinguishing characteristic with both biologic and therapeutic implications,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[7220, 1343, 305, 1790, 4, 898, 2769, 2, 31, 457, 64, 43, 21687, 35, 571, 864, 12, 16, 1093, 14803, 23, 4136, 1146, 169, 387, 336, 2152, 4, 21687, 4068, 1073, 3846, 1491, 14551, 2, 7955, 138, 32, 5575, 4804, 2, 296, 2787, 1, 2388, 4136, 1146, 483, 70, 563, 298, 3916, 15, 4548, 21, 311, 8, 993, 1, 33, 3724, 21687, 31, 285, 2, 201, 21687, 221, 347, 75, 1013, 17, 423, 1011, 4136, 7443, 1318, 1395, 764, 226, 9021, 261, 23, 3, 499, 2, 256, 4787, 22, 149, 22, 3420, 1860, 12388, 7220, 114, 65, 15342, 6, 1281, 2, 1347, 4133, 1, 4136, 261, 1350, 4, 21687, 141, 15130, 3495, 406, 1393, 4246, 127, 163, 2433, 3253, 64, 148, 1, 256, 4787, 42014, 43438, 2, 102, 37181, 92, 32, 925, 5, 544, 4136, 25971, 522, 26, 2705, 16, 164, 4, 110, 3916, 2, 4548, 109, 57, 2, 3500, 1, 4136, 1318, 1395, 1393, 241, 9, 4136, 25971, 10, 530, 4, 295, 3922, 742, 6627, 3, 2526, 17, 24603, 4, 21687, 3937, 4, 3, 3376, 1, 8, 4471, 4566, 1243, 1, 4136, 9245, 4136, 25971, 20, 4045, 1233, 6, 3081, 7160, 526, 57, 29, 127, 171, 163, 8, 4508, 2037, 5, 110, 1283, 2, 189, 1268]",1433.0,31128432,252
Effect of Tandem Autologous Stem Cell Transplant vs Single Transplant on Event-Free Survival in Patients With High-Risk Neuroblastoma: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,JAMA,JAMA,2019-08-01,"Induction chemotherapy followed by high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplant and subsequent antidisialoganglioside antibody immunotherapy is standard of care for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma, but survival rate among these patients remains low. To determine if tandem autologous transplant improves event-free survival (EFS) compared with single transplant. Patients were enrolled in this randomized clinical trial from November 2007 to February 2012 at 142 Children's Oncology Group centers in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Australia, and New Zealand. A total of 652 eligible patients aged 30 years or younger with protocol-defined high-risk neuroblastoma were enrolled and 355 were randomized. The final date of follow-up was June 29, 2017, and the data analyses cut-off date was June 30, 2017. Patients were randomized to receive tandem transplant with thiotepa/cyclophosphamide followed by dose-reduced carboplatin/etoposide/melphalan (n = 176) or single transplant with carboplatin/etoposide/melphalan (n = 179). The primary outcome was EFS from randomization to the occurrence of the first event (relapse, progression, secondary malignancy, or death from any cause). The study was designed to test the 1-sided hypothesis of superiority of tandem transplant compared with single transplant. Among the 652 eligible patients enrolled, 297 did not undergo randomization because they were nonrandomly assigned (n = 27), ineligible for randomization (n = 62), had no therapy (n = 1), or because of physician/parent preference (n = 207). Among 355 patients randomized (median diagnosis age, 36.1 months; 152 [42.8%] female), 297 patients (83.7%) completed the study and 21 (5.9%) were lost to follow-up after completing protocol therapy. Three-year EFS from the time of randomization was 61.6% (95% CI, 54.3%-68.9%) in the tandem transplant group and 48.4% (95% CI, 41.0%-55.7%) in the single transplant group (1-sided log-rank P=.006). The median (range) duration of follow-up after randomization for 181 patients without an event was 5.6 (0.6-8.9) years. The most common significant toxicities following tandem vs single transplant were mucosal (11.7% vs 15.4%) and infectious (17.9% vs 18.3%). Among patients aged 30 years or younger with high-risk neuroblastoma, tandem transplant resulted in a significantly better EFS than single transplant. However, because of the low randomization rate, the findings may not be representative of all patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.

RET fusions in solid tumors.,Cancer treatment reviews,Cancer Treat. Rev.,2019-10-30,"The RET proto-oncogene has been well-studied. RET is involved in many different physiological and developmental functions. When altered, RET mutations influence disease in a variety of organ systems from Hirschsprung's disease and multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 (MEN2) to papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Changes in RET expression have been discovered in 30-70% of invasive breast cancers and 50-60% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas in addition to colorectal adenocarcinoma, melanoma, small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, and small intestine neuroendocrine tumors. RET mutations have been associated with tumor proliferation, invasion, and migration. RET fusions or rearrangements are somatic juxtapositions of 5' sequences from other genes with 3' RET sequences encoding tyrosine kinase. RET rearrangements occur in approximately 2.5-73% of sporadic PTC and 1-3% of NSCLC patients. The most common RET fusions are CDCC6-RET and NCOA4-RET in PTC and KIF5B-RET in NSCLC. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are drugs that target kinases such as RET in RET-driven (RET-mutation or RET-fusion-positive) disease. Multikinase inhibitors (MKI) target various kinases and other receptors. Several MKIs are FDA-approved for cancer therapy (sunitinib, sorafenib, vandetanib, cabozantinib, regorafenib, ponatinib, lenvatinib, alectinib) and non-oncologic disease (nintedanib). Selective RET inhibitor drugs LOXO-292 (selpercatinib) and BLU-667 (pralsetinib) are also undergoing phase I/II and I clinical trials, respectively, with preliminary results demonstrating partial response and low incidence of serious adverse events. RET fusions provide a viable therapeutic target for oncologic treatment, and further study is warranted into the prevalence and pathogenesis of RET fusions as well as development of current and new tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",Journal Article,83.0,0.0,The RET proto-oncogene has been well-studied RET is involved in many different physiological and developmental functions When altered RET mutations influence disease in a variety of organ systems from Hirschsprung 's disease and multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 MEN2 to papillary carcinoma PTC and cell cancer NSCLC Changes in RET expression have been discovered in 30-70 of invasive cancers and 50-60 of ductal adenocarcinomas in addition to adenocarcinoma small cell cancer and small intestine neuroendocrine tumors RET mutations have been associated with tumor proliferation invasion and migration RET fusions or rearrangements are somatic juxtapositions of 5 sequences from other genes with 3 RET sequences encoding tyrosine kinase RET rearrangements occur in approximately 2.5-73 of sporadic PTC and 1-3 of NSCLC patients The most common RET fusions are CDCC6-RET and NCOA4-RET in PTC and KIF5B-RET in NSCLC Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are drugs that target kinases such as RET in RET-driven RET-mutation or RET-fusion-positive disease Multikinase inhibitors MKI target various kinases and other receptors Several MKIs are FDA-approved for cancer therapy sunitinib sorafenib vandetanib cabozantinib regorafenib ponatinib lenvatinib alectinib and non-oncologic disease nintedanib Selective RET inhibitor drugs LOXO-292 selpercatinib and BLU-667 pralsetinib are also undergoing phase I/II and I clinical trials respectively with preliminary results demonstrating partial response and low incidence of serious adverse events RET fusions provide a viable therapeutic target for oncologic treatment and further study is warranted into the prevalence and pathogenesis of RET fusions as well as development of current and new tyrosine kinase inhibitors,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[3, 2412, 4976, 1836, 71, 85, 149, 656, 2412, 16, 646, 4, 445, 338, 4733, 2, 4566, 1681, 198, 1495, 2412, 138, 1054, 34, 4, 8, 1362, 1, 1259, 1530, 29, 30234, 292, 34, 2, 232, 1293, 2298, 18, 28782, 6, 1796, 134, 3748, 2, 31, 12, 304, 400, 4, 2412, 55, 47, 85, 2747, 4, 201, 431, 1, 416, 163, 2, 212, 335, 1, 1258, 1586, 4, 352, 6, 449, 302, 31, 12, 2, 302, 6844, 1542, 57, 2412, 138, 47, 85, 41, 5, 30, 457, 578, 2, 1381, 2412, 2530, 15, 2072, 32, 1119, 75097, 1, 33, 2866, 29, 127, 214, 5, 27, 2412, 2866, 2362, 564, 216, 2412, 2072, 1271, 4, 705, 18, 33, 803, 1, 1928, 3748, 2, 14, 27, 1, 304, 7, 3, 96, 186, 2412, 2530, 32, 75098, 2412, 2, 19921, 2412, 4, 3748, 2, 17504, 2412, 4, 304, 564, 216, 222, 32, 600, 17, 283, 1549, 225, 22, 2412, 4, 2412, 1621, 2412, 258, 15, 2412, 1212, 109, 34, 6524, 222, 17968, 283, 747, 1549, 2, 127, 1186, 392, 28837, 32, 2078, 850, 9, 12, 36, 1086, 1034, 3493, 3048, 4848, 5715, 5470, 5857, 2, 220, 1998, 34, 11527, 1094, 2412, 230, 600, 24196, 8155, 75099, 2, 18774, 10598, 75100, 32, 120, 479, 124, 70, 215, 2, 70, 38, 143, 106, 5, 1676, 99, 2219, 450, 51, 2, 154, 287, 1, 1762, 290, 281, 2412, 2530, 377, 8, 2663, 189, 283, 9, 1998, 24, 2, 195, 45, 16, 1197, 237, 3, 1078, 2, 1384, 1, 2412, 2530, 22, 149, 22, 193, 1, 291, 2, 217, 564, 216, 222]",1747.0,31715421,265
