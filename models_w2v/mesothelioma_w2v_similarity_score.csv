"Increased expression of heat shock protein 70 in adherent ovarian cancer and mesothelioma following treatment with manumycin, a farnesyl transferase inhibitor.",Anticancer research,Anticancer Res.,,"Since farnesylation by farnesyltransferase (FTase) is the first obligatory step in the signaling transduction pathway of ras p21, FTase has been the target of new anticancer treatment modalities. Famesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs), a novel class of antitumor drugs that blocks the oncogenic activity of ras, were first developed as therapy for ras-mutated human tumors. FTIs are also capable of inhibiting tumors without ras mutations, while different mechanisms of cell growth inhibition by FTI have been proposed. In cell culture and in animal models, FTIs have been shown to be potent inhibitors of cancer cell growth. We showed that manumycin, a farnesyl pyrophosphate competitive inhibitor, inhibits ovarian and mesothelioma cancer cell growth. To examine the molecular changes after exposure to manumycin, total proteins from treated and untreated 2774 cell line were extracted and separated by two dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and detected by colloidal coomassie blue staining. The 2-DE was found reliable for comparison of protein profiles before and after manumycin treatment. Two protein spots (spot 1 and 2) appeared after manumycin treatment. Generated peptide peaks were matched by database query (prowl.rockefeller.edu/cgi-bin/ProFound) to a heat shock protein (HSP) and a modified HSP, both with MW 70 KD. The expression status of HSP 70 was confirmed by Western blot and HSP 70 ELISA using an antibody against HSP 70. The expression of HSP70 increased with the length of exposure to, and the dose of manumycin as demonstrated by ELISA. Increase in HSP70 expression was also observed by Western blot after a 48-hour treatment with manumycin in ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR3 and three other cell cultures derived from samples of patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. Our study is the first report demonstrating an up-regulation of HSP 70 in ovarian cancer cell lines and mesothelioma cell cultures after treatment with the FTI, manumycin. This up-regulation of HSP 70 may be a cellular mechanism of cell self-protection against the apoptotic process and cell death, and it may enhance resistance and account for the altered sensitivity of certain cancers to FTIs agents. HSPs may therefore be an important molecular target for drug intervention strategies.",Journal Article,,31.0,Since farnesylation by farnesyltransferase FTase is the first obligatory step in the signaling transduction pathway of ras p21 FTase has been the target of new anticancer treatment modalities Famesyl transferase inhibitors FTIs a novel class of antitumor drugs that blocks the oncogenic activity of ras were first developed as therapy for ras-mutated human tumors FTIs are also capable of inhibiting tumors without ras mutations while different mechanisms of cell growth inhibition by FTI have been proposed In cell culture and in animal models FTIs have been shown to be potent inhibitors of cancer cell growth We showed that manumycin a farnesyl pyrophosphate competitive inhibitor inhibits and cancer cell growth To examine the molecular changes after exposure to manumycin total proteins from treated and untreated 2774 cell line were extracted and separated by two dimensional gel electrophoresis 2-DE and detected by colloidal coomassie blue staining The 2-DE was found reliable for comparison of protein profiles before and after manumycin treatment Two protein spots spot 1 and 2 appeared after manumycin treatment Generated peptide peaks were matched by database query prowl.rockefeller.edu/cgi-bin/ProFound to a heat shock protein HSP and a modified HSP both with MW 70 KD The expression status of HSP 70 was confirmed by Western blot and HSP 70 ELISA using an antibody against HSP 70 The expression of HSP70 increased with the length of exposure to and the dose of manumycin as demonstrated by ELISA Increase in HSP70 expression was also observed by Western blot after a 48-hour treatment with manumycin in cancer cell line OVCAR3 and three other cell cultures derived from samples of patients diagnosed with cancer and Our study is the first report demonstrating an up-regulation of HSP 70 in cancer cell lines and cell cultures after treatment with the FTI manumycin This up-regulation of HSP 70 may be a cellular mechanism of cell self-protection against the apoptotic process and cell death and it may enhance resistance and account for the altered sensitivity of certain cancers to FTIs agents HSPs may therefore be an important molecular target for drug intervention strategies,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1192, 11905, 20, 7480, 14104, 16, 3, 157, 23107, 2458, 4, 3, 314, 2761, 308, 1, 1102, 2657, 14104, 71, 85, 3, 283, 1, 217, 1475, 24, 1558, 52905, 4402, 222, 8576, 8, 229, 1040, 1, 579, 600, 17, 2860, 3, 1302, 128, 1, 1102, 11, 157, 276, 22, 36, 9, 1102, 1185, 171, 57, 8576, 32, 120, 2787, 1, 2062, 57, 187, 1102, 138, 369, 338, 483, 1, 31, 129, 297, 20, 10401, 47, 85, 1587, 4, 31, 2099, 2, 4, 2026, 274, 8576, 47, 85, 443, 6, 40, 1157, 222, 1, 12, 31, 129, 21, 224, 17, 18782, 8, 8846, 26010, 6487, 230, 1576, 2, 12, 31, 129, 6, 1004, 3, 219, 400, 50, 645, 6, 18782, 181, 652, 29, 73, 2, 1278, 18783, 31, 328, 11, 2484, 2, 4910, 20, 100, 2201, 5916, 6777, 18, 1566, 2, 530, 20, 18179, 52906, 3352, 1029, 3, 18, 1566, 10, 204, 2450, 9, 1155, 1, 178, 1241, 348, 2, 50, 18782, 24, 100, 178, 8382, 6901, 14, 2, 18, 2121, 50, 18782, 24, 1419, 1389, 8922, 11, 655, 20, 609, 12259, 52907, 52908, 15120, 18180, 37174, 4399, 6, 8, 3545, 3971, 178, 7921, 2, 8, 1230, 7921, 110, 5, 21033, 431, 6271, 3, 55, 156, 1, 7921, 431, 10, 557, 20, 1521, 2639, 2, 7921, 431, 3664, 75, 35, 548, 480, 7921, 431, 3, 55, 1, 6126, 101, 5, 3, 1318, 1, 645, 6, 2, 3, 61, 1, 18782, 22, 264, 20, 3664, 344, 4, 6126, 55, 10, 120, 164, 20, 1521, 2639, 50, 8, 576, 2583, 24, 5, 18782, 4, 12, 31, 328, 24455, 2, 169, 127, 31, 3231, 526, 29, 347, 1, 7, 265, 5, 12, 2, 114, 45, 16, 3, 157, 414, 2219, 35, 126, 863, 1, 7921, 431, 4, 12, 31, 285, 2, 31, 3231, 50, 24, 5, 3, 10401, 18782, 26, 126, 863, 1, 7921, 431, 68, 40, 8, 763, 670, 1, 31, 1074, 3525, 480, 3, 1631, 1129, 2, 31, 273, 2, 192, 68, 1304, 251, 2, 1967, 9, 3, 1495, 485, 1, 1840, 163, 6, 8576, 183, 13504, 68, 673, 40, 35, 305, 219, 283, 9, 234, 788, 422]",2194.0,12014635,1
"Despite some expression of folate receptor alpha in human mesothelioma cells, internalization of methotrexate is predominantly carrier mediated.",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg.,2002-05-01,"As a response to a published report documenting some expression of folate receptor alpha in human mesothelioma, studies were carried out examining the role of this receptor versus that of the reduced folate carrier in the internalization of folate analogs in this neoplasm. Influx measurements of tritiated methotrexate were carried out in 4 mesothelioma cell lines, and 2 additional cell lines were used as comparators. Relative gene-expression analysis for the carrier and receptor gene was done by using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in the above-mentioned cell lines and mesothelioma tumor tissues obtained from patients. Internalization of tritiated methotrexate in mesothelioma cell lines grown at physiologic folate levels was carrier mediated rather than receptor mediated. Influx of this model permeant by these cells exhibited characteristics of carrier-mediated membrane transport and was only minimally reduced by the addition of 5 micromol/L folic acid, a concentration of this natural folate that would have completely inhibited influx by the folate receptor. Gene-expression analysis revealed prominent expression of the folate receptor in some but not all mesothelioma cell lines, and in only one case was expression of this receptor gene greater than expression of the reduced folate carrier gene. Similar analysis of human mesothelioma tumor tissue showed that, with few exceptions, receptor gene expression was substantially less than that for the carrier gene. In view of the ongoing reduced folate carrier-mediated internalization that occurs in mesothelioma cells, these results would seem to argue against a role for the folate receptor in the internalization and cellular pharmacokinetics of methotrexate and other classic folate analogs in this neoplasm.

Pharmacobiologically based scheduling of capecitabine and docetaxel results in antitumor activity in resistant human malignancies.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2002-06-01,"Capecitabine and docetaxel have demonstrated preclinical antitumor synergy. This synergy is thought to occur from docetaxel-mediated upregulation of thymidine phosphorylase (dThdPase), an enzyme responsible for the relative tumor selectivity of capecitabine. On the basis of the time-dependency and transiency for this upregulation, we performed a phase I study of capecitabine in combination with weekly docetaxel. We hypothesized that weekly docetaxel would result in sustained dThdPase expression and that capecitabine administration at times of maximum dThdPase upregulation would increase the therapeutic index for this combination. Patients with advanced solid malignancies received docetaxel on days 1, 8, and 15, and capecitabine bid on days 5 to 18, every 4 weeks. Docetaxel was fixed at 36 mg/m(2)/wk, whereas capecitabine was escalated in successive patients cohorts. Sixteen patients received 77 courses at capecitabine doses from 950 to 1,500 mg/m(2)/d. The most common toxicities were hand-foot syndrome, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and asthenia. Grades 3 to 4 hematologic toxicities were infrequent and no treatment-related hospitalizations occurred. Three of three patients treated at 1,500/36 mg/m(2) capecitabine/docetaxel developed grade 3 hand-foot syndrome or diarrhea during either their first or second course, whereas only two of 13 patients at 1,250/36 mg/m(2) doses developed significant toxicity. Antitumor responses (n = 7) occurred in patients with hepatocellular, non-small-cell lung, and chemotherapy-refractory breast, bladder, and colorectal carcinomas. Prolonged stabilizations occurred in patients with metastatic mesothelioma (n = 2), chemorefractory non-small-cell lung carcinoma, and bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. Capecitabine in combination with weekly docetaxel is well tolerated. Recommended doses are capecitabine 1,250 mg/m(2)/d (625 mg/m(2) bid) with docetaxel 36 mg/m(2)/wk.

Translation of microarray data into clinically relevant cancer diagnostic tests using gene expression ratios in lung cancer and mesothelioma.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2002-09-01,"The pathological distinction between malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM)and adenocarcinoma (ADCA) of the lung can be cumbersome using established methods. We propose that a simple technique, based on the expression levels of a small number of genes, can be useful in the early and accurate diagnosis of MPM and lung cancer. This method is designed to accurately distinguish between genetically disparate tissues using gene expression ratios and rationally chosen thresholds. Here we have tested the fidelity of ratio-based diagnosis in differentiating between MPM and lung cancer in 181 tissue samples (31 MPM and 150 ADCA). A training set of 32 samples (16 MPM and 16 ADCA) was used to identify pairs of genes with highly significant, inversely correlated expression levels to form a total of 15 diagnostic ratios using expression profiling data. Any single ratio of the 15 examined was at least 90% accurate in predicting diagnosis for the remaining 149 samples (e.g., test set). We then examined (in the test set) the accuracy of multiple ratios combined to form a simple diagnostic tool.

Inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling in malignant pleural mesothelioma.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2002-09-01,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare malignancy with no known curative modality. Approximately 70% of MPMs have high levels of expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and a subset of cell lines derived from MPM patients express both EGFR and transforming growth factor alpha, suggesting an autocrine role for EGFR in MPM. We have determined the effects of EGFR inhibition in MPM cell lines in vitro, using four MPM cell lines derived from previously untreated patients with epithelial (H2461 and H2591), sarcomatoid (H2373), and biphasic (MSTO-211H) MPM. All four cell lines expressed EGFR at levels comparable with the non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell line A549, as shown by Western blot analysis. ZD1839 significantly inhibited epidermal growth factor-dependent cell signaling including phosphorylation of AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 in all MPM cell lines. Furthermore, treatment with ZD1839 led to a significant dose-dependent reduction of colony formation (41-89% at 10 microM) when MPM cells were grown in soft agarose. MSTO-211H, H2461, and H2373 were more sensitive to the growth-inhibitory effects of ZD1839 than was the NSCLC cell line A549, whereas H2591 had similar sensitivity to A549. This variability in growth-inhibitory effects is not related to the amount of EGFR present on MPM cells or to the degree of inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation by ZD1839. We show that H2373 MPM cells, which show 89% growth inhibition at 10 microM ZD1839, undergo a dose-dependent arrest at the G(1)-S phase of the cell cycle and a corresponding increase in p27 levels. However, H2591 cell lines, which show 41% growth inhibition at 10 microM ZD1839, undergo no significant cell cycle changes or changes in p27 levels. Our findings demonstrate that in vitro, ZD1839 is as effective or more effective against MPM cell lines as it is against the NSCLC cell line A549 and suggest that ZD1839 may be an effective therapeutic option for patients with MPM.",Journal Article,6351.0,119.0,Malignant pleural MPM is a rare malignancy with no known curative modality Approximately 70 of MPMs have high levels of expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR and a subset of cell lines derived from MPM patients express both EGFR and transforming growth factor alpha suggesting an autocrine role for EGFR in MPM We have determined the effects of EGFR inhibition in MPM cell lines in vitro using four MPM cell lines derived from previously untreated patients with epithelial H2461 and H2591 sarcomatoid H2373 and biphasic MSTO-211H MPM All four cell lines expressed EGFR at levels comparable with the cell carcinoma NSCLC cell line A549 as shown by Western blot analysis ZD1839 significantly inhibited epidermal growth factor-dependent cell signaling including phosphorylation of AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 in all MPM cell lines Furthermore treatment with ZD1839 led to a significant dose-dependent reduction of colony formation 41-89 at 10 microM when MPM cells were grown in soft agarose MSTO-211H H2461 and H2373 were more sensitive to the growth-inhibitory effects of ZD1839 than was the NSCLC cell line A549 whereas H2591 had similar sensitivity to A549 This variability in growth-inhibitory effects is not related to the amount of EGFR present on MPM cells or to the degree of inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation by ZD1839 We show that H2373 MPM cells which show 89 growth inhibition at 10 microM ZD1839 undergo a dose-dependent arrest at the G 1 -S phase of the cell cycle and a corresponding increase in p27 levels However H2591 cell lines which show 41 growth inhibition at 10 microM ZD1839 undergo no significant cell cycle changes or changes in p27 levels Our findings demonstrate that in vitro ZD1839 is as effective or more effective against MPM cell lines as it is against the NSCLC cell line A549 and suggest that ZD1839 may be an effective therapeutic option for patients with MPM,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[393, 2164, 3278, 16, 8, 622, 710, 5, 77, 440, 1075, 1396, 705, 431, 1, 26064, 47, 64, 148, 1, 55, 1, 3, 829, 129, 161, 153, 227, 2, 8, 697, 1, 31, 285, 526, 29, 3278, 7, 1669, 110, 227, 2, 3621, 129, 161, 950, 802, 35, 5297, 200, 9, 227, 4, 3278, 21, 47, 509, 3, 176, 1, 227, 297, 4, 3278, 31, 285, 4, 439, 75, 294, 3278, 31, 285, 526, 29, 373, 1278, 7, 5, 701, 24507, 2, 37273, 3912, 30311, 2, 7739, 30312, 27958, 3278, 62, 294, 31, 285, 570, 227, 28, 148, 1279, 5, 3, 31, 134, 304, 31, 328, 4105, 22, 443, 20, 1521, 2639, 65, 5153, 97, 879, 829, 129, 161, 470, 31, 314, 141, 982, 1, 649, 2, 1976, 1235, 1065, 1549, 14, 2, 18, 4, 62, 3278, 31, 285, 798, 24, 5, 5153, 836, 6, 8, 93, 61, 470, 628, 1, 1975, 1264, 605, 887, 28, 79, 3550, 198, 3278, 37, 11, 5473, 4, 1214, 18214, 30312, 27958, 24507, 2, 30311, 11, 80, 745, 6, 3, 129, 1810, 176, 1, 5153, 76, 10, 3, 304, 31, 328, 4105, 547, 37273, 42, 288, 485, 6, 4105, 26, 1982, 4, 129, 1810, 176, 16, 44, 139, 6, 3, 3108, 1, 227, 364, 23, 3278, 37, 15, 6, 3, 1444, 1, 297, 1, 227, 982, 20, 5153, 21, 514, 17, 30311, 3278, 37, 92, 514, 887, 129, 297, 28, 79, 3550, 5153, 1251, 8, 61, 470, 1854, 28, 3, 499, 14, 695, 124, 1, 3, 31, 417, 2, 8, 1734, 344, 4, 2804, 148, 137, 37273, 31, 285, 92, 514, 605, 129, 297, 28, 79, 3550, 5153, 1251, 77, 93, 31, 417, 400, 15, 400, 4, 2804, 148, 114, 272, 608, 17, 4, 439, 5153, 16, 22, 323, 15, 80, 323, 480, 3278, 31, 285, 22, 192, 16, 480, 3, 304, 31, 328, 4105, 2, 309, 17, 5153, 68, 40, 35, 323, 189, 1501, 9, 7, 5, 3278]",1939.0,12234991,92

Targeted therapy against human lung cancer in nude mice by high-affinity recombinant antimesothelin single-chain Fv immunotoxin.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2002-06-01,"Several tumors, including mesothelioma and ovarian cancer, can overexpress mesothelin, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked differentiation glycoprotein. The membrane-bound type of mesothelin is found in the blood of cancer patients at a very low level, which makes mesothelin a good candidate for targeted therapy of certain cancers. An antimesothelin disulfide-linked Fv (SS1 Fv) was fused to a truncated mutant of Pseudomonas exotoxin A to produce the recombinant immunotoxin SS1(dsFv)-PE38, which has a high binding affinity to mesothelin (Kd = 0.7 nM).

When administered at a nontoxic dose of 500 microg/kg on days 7, 9, and 11 to nude mice injected i.v. with the two human lung cancer cell lines, SS1(dsFv)-PE38 selectively inhibited experimental lung metastases produced by the mesothelin-producing NCI-H226 cells.

The use of CDKN2A deletion as a diagnostic marker for malignant mesothelioma in body cavity effusions.,Cancer,Cancer,2003-02-01,"The distinction between benign reactive mesothelial cells and malignant mesothelial cells in serous effusions is difficult and has an unusually high false negative rate. Unfortunately, there are no generally accepted markers to distinguish between benign reactive and malignant mesothelial cells. Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A is frequent in mesothelioma (present in > 70% of tumors). Therefore, detection of CDKN2A deletion by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was evaluated as an ancillary test in the cytologic diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. Dual-color FISH for CDKN2A and chromosome 9 centromere was performed on cytolyt-fixed Thinprep slides from 6 cytologically suspicious and 7 cytologically positive effusions (all with histologically confirmed mesothelioma) and in 19 cytologically benign effusions (14 pleural effusions, 3 pericardial effusions, and 2 abdominal fluid specimens). Specimens containing > or = 15 nuclei that lacked signals for CDKN2A but showed at least 1 signal for chromosome 9 centromere were considered positive. In samples with negative cytology, the nuclei of at least 100 mesothelial cells were evaluated; whereas, in specimens with positive or suspicious cytology, counting nuclei was done only if < 15% of nuclei showed homozygous loss of CDKN2A. Homozygous deletion was detected in mesothelial cells in six of seven specimens with positive cytology and in six of six specimens with suspicious cytology. Cytologically, there were numerous tumor cells in a single positive specimen without homozygous deletion. All 19 cytologically negative specimens were negative for CDKN2A deletion. The detection of homozygous CDKN2A deletion by FISH would have been helpful in confirming a diagnosis of mesothelioma over reactive mesothelial cells in 12 of 13 samples with positive or suspicious cytology. Further studies on larger series of patients with suspicious cytology are needed to evaluate the validity and efficiency of this approach for improving the diagnostic accuracy of effusion cytology.",Clinical Trial,6198.0,94.0,The distinction between benign reactive mesothelial cells and malignant mesothelial cells in serous effusions is difficult and has an unusually high false negative rate Unfortunately there are no generally accepted markers to distinguish between benign reactive and malignant mesothelial cells Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A is frequent in present in 70 of tumors Therefore detection of CDKN2A deletion by fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH was evaluated as an ancillary test in the cytologic diagnosis of malignant Dual-color FISH for CDKN2A and chromosome 9 centromere was performed on cytolyt-fixed Thinprep slides from 6 cytologically suspicious and 7 cytologically positive effusions all with histologically confirmed and in 19 cytologically benign effusions 14 pleural effusions 3 pericardial effusions and 2 abdominal fluid specimens Specimens containing or 15 nuclei that lacked signals for CDKN2A but showed at least 1 signal for chromosome 9 centromere were considered positive In samples with negative cytology the nuclei of at least 100 mesothelial cells were evaluated whereas in specimens with positive or suspicious cytology counting nuclei was done only if 15 of nuclei showed homozygous loss of CDKN2A Homozygous deletion was detected in mesothelial cells in six of seven specimens with positive cytology and in six of six specimens with suspicious cytology Cytologically there were numerous tumor cells in a single positive specimen without homozygous deletion All 19 cytologically negative specimens were negative for CDKN2A deletion The detection of homozygous CDKN2A deletion by FISH would have been helpful in confirming a diagnosis of over reactive mesothelial cells in 12 of 13 samples with positive or suspicious cytology Further studies on larger series of patients with suspicious cytology are needed to evaluate the validity and efficiency of this approach for improving the diagnostic accuracy of effusion cytology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 6628, 59, 1002, 2163, 10308, 37, 2, 393, 10308, 37, 4, 1744, 5154, 16, 1740, 2, 71, 35, 15499, 64, 2133, 199, 116, 3869, 125, 32, 77, 1228, 3058, 525, 6, 3081, 59, 1002, 2163, 2, 393, 10308, 37, 3189, 1528, 1, 3175, 16, 908, 4, 364, 4, 431, 1, 57, 673, 638, 1, 3175, 1528, 20, 1591, 4, 957, 1554, 1277, 10, 194, 22, 35, 8496, 412, 4, 3, 4195, 147, 1, 393, 1828, 6052, 1277, 9, 3175, 2, 1170, 83, 12699, 10, 173, 23, 53383, 1959, 12772, 3830, 29, 49, 8514, 3230, 2, 67, 8514, 109, 5154, 62, 5, 2161, 557, 2, 4, 326, 8514, 1002, 5154, 213, 2164, 5154, 27, 6657, 5154, 2, 18, 1467, 2357, 623, 623, 1101, 15, 167, 4725, 17, 5005, 2312, 9, 3175, 84, 224, 28, 506, 14, 1235, 9, 1170, 83, 12699, 11, 515, 109, 4, 347, 5, 199, 2045, 3, 4725, 1, 28, 506, 394, 10308, 37, 11, 194, 547, 4, 623, 5, 109, 15, 3230, 2045, 9479, 4725, 10, 1822, 158, 492, 167, 1, 4725, 224, 3189, 407, 1, 3175, 3189, 1528, 10, 530, 4, 10308, 37, 4, 437, 1, 648, 623, 5, 109, 2045, 2, 4, 437, 1, 437, 623, 5, 3230, 2045, 8514, 125, 11, 2331, 30, 37, 4, 8, 226, 109, 2360, 187, 3189, 1528, 62, 326, 8514, 199, 623, 11, 199, 9, 3175, 1528, 3, 638, 1, 3189, 3175, 1528, 20, 1277, 688, 47, 85, 3951, 4, 5030, 8, 147, 1, 252, 2163, 10308, 37, 4, 133, 1, 233, 347, 5, 109, 15, 3230, 2045, 195, 94, 23, 1077, 988, 1, 7, 5, 3230, 2045, 32, 575, 6, 376, 3, 3099, 2, 2904, 1, 26, 353, 9, 1673, 3, 752, 1190, 1, 4433, 2045]",1947.0,12589646,26
Malignant mesothelioma growth inhibition by agents that target the VEGF and VEGF-C autocrine loops.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2003-05-01,"Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a locally aggressive tumor that originates from the mesothelial cells of the pleural and sometimes peritoneal surface. Conventional treatments for MM, consisting of chemotherapy or surgery give little survival benefit to patients, who generally die within 1 year of diagnosis. Hence, there is an urgent need for the development of alternative therapies. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an autocrine growth factor for MM. The closely related molecule, VEGF-C, is also implicated in malignant mesothelioma growth. VEGF-C and its cognate receptor VEGFR-3 are co-expressed in mesothelioma cell lines. A functional VEGF-C autocrine growth loop was demonstrated in mesothelioma cells by targeting VEGF-C expression and binding to VEGFR-3. The ability of novel agents that reduce the levels of VEGF and VEGF-C to inhibit mesothelioma cell growth in vitro was assessed. Antisense oligonucleotide (ODN) complementary to VEGF that inhibited VEGF and VEGF-C expression simultaneously specifically inhibited mesothelioma cell growth. Similarly, antibodies to VEGF receptor (VEGFR-2) and VEGF-C receptor (VEGFR-3) were synergistic in inhibiting mesothelioma cell growth. In addition, a diphtheria toxin-VEGF fusion protein (DT-VEGF), which is toxic to cells that express VEGF receptors was very effective in inhibiting mesothelioma cell growth in vitro. These results indicate that targeting VEGF and VEGF-C simultaneously may be an effective therapeutic approach for malignant mesothelioma.",Journal Article,6109.0,123.0,Malignant MM is a locally aggressive tumor that originates from the mesothelial cells of the pleural and sometimes peritoneal surface Conventional treatments for MM consisting of chemotherapy or surgery give little survival benefit to patients who generally die within 1 year of diagnosis Hence there is an urgent need for the development of alternative therapies Vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF is an autocrine growth factor for MM The closely related molecule VEGF-C is also implicated in malignant growth VEGF-C and its cognate receptor VEGFR-3 are co-expressed in cell lines A functional VEGF-C autocrine growth loop was demonstrated in cells by targeting VEGF-C expression and binding to VEGFR-3 The ability of novel agents that reduce the levels of VEGF and VEGF-C to inhibit cell growth in vitro was assessed Antisense oligonucleotide ODN complementary to VEGF that inhibited VEGF and VEGF-C expression simultaneously specifically inhibited cell growth Similarly antibodies to VEGF receptor VEGFR-2 and VEGF-C receptor VEGFR-3 were synergistic in inhibiting cell growth In addition a diphtheria toxin-VEGF fusion protein DT-VEGF which is toxic to cells that express VEGF receptors was very effective in inhibiting cell growth in vitro These results indicate that targeting VEGF and VEGF-C simultaneously may be an effective therapeutic approach for malignant,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[393, 321, 16, 8, 795, 571, 30, 17, 15184, 29, 3, 10308, 37, 1, 3, 2164, 2, 5164, 1639, 1255, 809, 640, 9, 321, 2273, 1, 56, 15, 152, 4978, 1215, 25, 247, 6, 7, 54, 1228, 3384, 262, 14, 111, 1, 147, 3665, 125, 16, 35, 5013, 594, 9, 3, 193, 1, 1091, 235, 756, 845, 129, 161, 618, 16, 35, 5297, 129, 161, 9, 321, 3, 3210, 139, 1354, 618, 256, 16, 120, 1771, 4, 393, 129, 618, 256, 2, 211, 8903, 153, 2134, 27, 32, 1269, 570, 4, 31, 285, 8, 583, 618, 256, 5297, 129, 4432, 10, 264, 4, 37, 20, 529, 618, 256, 55, 2, 791, 6, 2134, 27, 3, 801, 1, 229, 183, 17, 969, 3, 148, 1, 618, 2, 618, 256, 6, 1433, 31, 129, 4, 439, 10, 275, 4645, 4727, 11601, 3380, 6, 618, 17, 879, 618, 2, 618, 256, 55, 3074, 1225, 879, 31, 129, 1813, 890, 6, 618, 153, 2134, 18, 2, 618, 256, 153, 2134, 27, 11, 1806, 4, 2062, 31, 129, 4, 352, 8, 15853, 8848, 618, 1212, 178, 5281, 618, 92, 16, 1812, 6, 37, 17, 1669, 618, 1186, 10, 923, 323, 4, 2062, 31, 129, 4, 439, 46, 99, 1008, 17, 529, 618, 2, 618, 256, 3074, 68, 40, 35, 323, 189, 353, 9, 393]",1373.0,12594815,0
A phase I study of Foscan-mediated photodynamic therapy and surgery in patients with mesothelioma.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac.

A phase I clinical trial combining surgical debulking with Foscan-mediated PDT was performed in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. The purpose of the study was to define the toxicities and to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of Foscan-mediated PDT. A total of 26 patients completed treatment. Tumor debulking was accomplished with either an extrapleural pneumonectomy (7 patients) or a lung-sparing pleurectomy-decortication (19 patients). Patients were injected with Foscan before surgery, and 652 nm light was delivered intraoperatively after completion of surgical debulking. Four light sensors were placed in the chest, allowing delivery of light to a uniform measured dose throughout the hemithorax. Four dose levels were explored. The MTD was 0.1 mg/kg of Foscan injected 6 days before surgery in combination with 10 J x cm(-2) 652 nm light. Dose limiting toxicity at the next higher dose was a systemic capillary leak syndrome leading to death in 2 of 3 patients treated at that dose. Other PDT-related toxicities included wound burns and skin photosensitivity. In all, 14 patients were treated at the MTD without significant complications. Foscan-mediated PDT can be safely combined with surgery at the established MTD.

Phase II study of pemetrexed with and without folic acid and vitamin B12 as front-line therapy in malignant pleural mesothelioma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2003-04-01,"This phase II clinical study evaluated the efficacy of pemetrexed for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Patients with a histologically proven diagnosis of MPM, chemotherapy-naive measurable lesions, and adequate organ function received pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) intravenously over 10 minutes every 3 weeks. After a protocol change, most patients also received folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation to improve safety. A total of 64 patients were enrolled. Nine (14.1%) of the 64 patients had a partial response. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for median overall survival was 10.7 months. Forty-three patients received vitamin supplementation for all courses of therapy, and 21 patients did not. Seven of the nine responders were vitamin supplemented. The median overall survival was 13.0 months for supplemented patients and 8.0 months for nonsupplemented patients. Vitamin-supplemented patients completed more cycles of therapy than nonsupplemented patients (median, six v two cycles, respectively). Grade 3/4 neutropenia (23.4%) and grade 3/4 leukopenia (18.8%) were the most common laboratory toxicities. Fatigue and febrile neutropenia were the most commonly reported nonlaboratory events (grade 3, 6.3%; grade 4, 0.0% each). The incidence of these toxicities was generally lower in the supplemented patients. Single-agent pemetrexed for MPM resulted in a moderate response rate (14.1%) and median overall survival of 10.7 months. Patients supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B12 tolerated treatment better (less toxicity and more cycles of treatment) and had a 5-month greater median overall survival than nonsupplemented patients.

Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of enhanced Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase mutants improves prodrug-mediated tumor cell killing.,Cancer gene therapy,Cancer Gene Ther.,2003-05-01,"The Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV) thymidine kinase (tk) suicide gene together with ganciclovir (GCV) have been successfully used for the in vivo treatment of various solid tumors and for the ablation of unwanted transfused stem cells in recent clinical trials. With the aim of improving this therapeutic system, we compared the potential efficacy of adenoviral (Ad) vectors expressing enhanced tk mutants in vitro and in vivo. The previously created HSV-tk mutants dm30 and sr39, created by random sequence mutagenesis, were inserted into a standard Ad.RSV E1(-)E3(-) backbone using homologous recombination. GCV killing of Ad.HSV-tk, Ad.dm30-tk and Ad.sr39-tk was assessed in various tumor cell lines with a cell proliferation assay. Cells expressing the two TK mutants were two-to-five-fold more sensitive to GCV when compared with Ad.HSV-tk transduced cells in all cell lines tested (five human mesotheliomas, one human lung cancer, a human cervical carcinoma, a mouse fibrosarcoma, and a rat glioma line) at equal TK expression levels. Flank tumor models, including cell-mixing studies, assessed the in vivo efficacy of the engineered viruses in BALB/C and SCID mice. In all animal studies, Ad.dm30-tk and Ad.sr39-tk showed more tumor growth inhibition than Ad.HSV-tk when GCV was administered.

Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A and codeletion of the methylthioadenosine phosphorylase gene in the majority of pleural mesotheliomas.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2003-06-01,"Homozygous deletions at chromosome region 9p21 targeting the CDKN2A gene have been reported as a common cytogenetic abnormality in mesothelioma. MTAP, a gene approximately 100-kb telomeric to CDKN2A, encodes methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, an enzyme essential in the salvage of cellular adenine and methionine, and its codeletion with CDKN2A has been reported in other tumors. The aim of this study was to define the prevalence of homozygous deletion of CDKN2A alone or in combination with MTAP in a large series of pleural mesothelioma. We used a fluorescent in situ hybridization assay for CDKN2A and MTAP on interphase nuclei in imprints of frozen tissue from 95 cases of pleural mesothelioma. Histologically, the cases were classified as epithelial (71), biphasic (19) and sarcomatous (5). In each experiment, a 9p21 locus specific probe and a chromosome 9 centromeric probe were used and fluorescent in situ hybridization signals for both probes were simultaneously recorded in at least 100 nuclei. Cases were considered homozygously deleted if both 9p21 signals were lost in at least 20% of nuclei. Overall, 70 cases (74%) had homozygous deletion of CDKN2A. MTAP was codeleted in 64 of these cases (91%). No case with MTAP deletion without CDKN2A deletion was identified. Homozygous loss of CDKN2A was seen in 49 of 71 epithelial (70%), 16 of 19 biphasic (89%), and 5 of 5 sarcomatous (100%) mesotheliomas. Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A is seen in the majority of pleural mesotheliomas, and MTAP is codeleted in most of these cases. Previous cell line studies have shown that loss of MTAP renders cells dependent on de novo synthesis of purine derivatives. Thus, the particularly high prevalence of MTAP codeletion in mesothelioma makes it an ideal candidate for trials of targeted therapy using inhibitors of de novo AMP synthesis (e.g., L-alanosine).",Journal Article,6078.0,171.0,Homozygous deletions at chromosome region 9p21 targeting the CDKN2A gene have been reported as a common cytogenetic abnormality in MTAP a gene approximately 100-kb telomeric to CDKN2A encodes methylthioadenosine phosphorylase an enzyme essential in the salvage of cellular adenine and methionine and its codeletion with CDKN2A has been reported in other tumors The aim of this study was to define the prevalence of homozygous deletion of CDKN2A alone or in combination with MTAP in a large series of pleural We used a fluorescent in situ hybridization assay for CDKN2A and MTAP on interphase nuclei in imprints of frozen tissue from 95 cases of pleural Histologically the cases were classified as epithelial 71 biphasic 19 and sarcomatous 5 In each experiment a 9p21 locus specific probe and a chromosome 9 centromeric probe were used and fluorescent in situ hybridization signals for both probes were simultaneously recorded in at least 100 nuclei Cases were considered homozygously deleted if both 9p21 signals were lost in at least 20 of nuclei Overall 70 cases 74 had homozygous deletion of CDKN2A MTAP was codeleted in 64 of these cases 91 No case with MTAP deletion without CDKN2A deletion was identified Homozygous loss of CDKN2A was seen in 49 of 71 epithelial 70 16 of 19 biphasic 89 and 5 of 5 sarcomatous 100 mesotheliomas Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A is seen in the majority of pleural mesotheliomas and MTAP is codeleted in most of these cases Previous cell line studies have shown that loss of MTAP renders cells dependent on de novo synthesis of purine derivatives Thus the particularly high prevalence of MTAP codeletion in makes it an ideal candidate for trials of targeted therapy using inhibitors of de novo AMP synthesis e.g. L-alanosine,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3189, 2439, 28, 1170, 1053, 9016, 529, 3, 3175, 145, 47, 85, 210, 22, 8, 186, 1266, 3698, 4, 22112, 8, 145, 705, 394, 5116, 10944, 6, 3175, 4322, 30428, 10658, 35, 1644, 1452, 4, 3, 992, 1, 763, 16307, 2, 5686, 2, 211, 11622, 5, 3175, 71, 85, 210, 4, 127, 57, 3, 1130, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 1107, 3, 1078, 1, 3189, 1528, 1, 3175, 279, 15, 4, 150, 5, 22112, 4, 8, 375, 988, 1, 2164, 21, 95, 8, 2910, 4, 957, 1554, 719, 9, 3175, 2, 22112, 23, 8081, 4725, 4, 43268, 1, 3015, 246, 29, 48, 140, 1, 2164, 2161, 3, 140, 11, 1373, 22, 701, 792, 7739, 326, 2, 10445, 33, 4, 296, 8722, 8, 9016, 2474, 112, 2888, 2, 8, 1170, 83, 15531, 2888, 11, 95, 2, 2910, 4, 957, 1554, 2312, 9, 110, 3701, 11, 3074, 1872, 4, 28, 506, 394, 4725, 140, 11, 515, 37312, 4389, 492, 110, 9016, 2312, 11, 3009, 4, 28, 506, 179, 1, 4725, 63, 431, 140, 794, 42, 3189, 1528, 1, 3175, 22112, 10, 12330, 4, 660, 1, 46, 140, 970, 77, 473, 5, 22112, 1528, 187, 3175, 1528, 10, 108, 3189, 407, 1, 3175, 10, 527, 4, 739, 1, 792, 701, 431, 245, 1, 326, 7739, 887, 2, 33, 1, 33, 10445, 394, 11789, 3189, 1528, 1, 3175, 16, 527, 4, 3, 686, 1, 2164, 11789, 2, 22112, 16, 12330, 4, 96, 1, 46, 140, 698, 31, 328, 94, 47, 443, 17, 407, 1, 22112, 8080, 37, 470, 23, 1566, 2018, 2525, 1, 5006, 6490, 631, 3, 823, 64, 1078, 1, 22112, 11622, 4, 4677, 192, 35, 3662, 1609, 9, 143, 1, 238, 36, 75, 222, 1, 1566, 2018, 7793, 2525, 563, 499, 805, 53570]",1758.0,12796375,14
Hemithoracic radiation after extrapleural pneumonectomy for malignant pleural mesothelioma.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2003-08-01,"The treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma remains a therapeutic challenge, with median survival rates of about 12 months and local failure rates of up to 80%. Our institution recently published results showing that extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) followed by hemithoracic radiation yielded excellent local control. This paper reports our technique for high-dose hemithoracic radiation after EPP. Between 1990 and 2001, 35 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma were treated with EPP followed by hemithoracic radiation therapy (median dose: 54 Gy, range: 45-54 Gy) at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. EPP was defined as en bloc resection of the entire pleura, lung, and diaphragm with or without resection of the pericardium. The radiation therapy target volume was the entire hemithorax, including the pleural folds and the thoracotomy and chest tube incision sites. Patients were treated with a total dose of 5400 cGy delivered in 30 fractions of 180 cGy. Radiation therapy was well tolerated, and toxicity data are described. Of the 35 patients analyzed, 29 patients were male, and 18 had right-sided tumors. Twenty-six had epithelioid histologies. UICC stage was I in 4, II in 11, III in 19, and IV in 1 patient. As shown by axial and sagittal isodose distributions, we were able to deliver adequate doses to the target volume while limiting dose to critical structures such as heart, spinal cord, liver, and stomach.

Positron emission tomography defines metastatic disease but not locoregional disease in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg.,2003-07-01,"Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging often fail to predict resectability in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. Small studies suggest that fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography may improve staging. We analyzed our experience to determine more definitively the potential utility of fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. Patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma who underwent fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scanning were identified from an institutional database. All patients fasted and received a minimum of 10 mCi of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose. Whole-body emission studies were acquired, followed by whole-body transmission studies, allowing iterative reconstruction. Blinded review of positron emission tomography scans was performed for clinical staging, which was then correlated with surgical and pathologic findings. Sensitivity and specificity were determined for tumor and nodal status. From 1998 to 2002, 63 patients underwent positron emission tomography scans, 60 preoperatively and 3 to assess disease recurrence after surgery. Increased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake was seen in all but 1 tumor, which was very early stage (IA). Positron emission tomography findings yielded sensitivities of only 19% and 11% for tumor and nodal status, respectively. However, a high standard uptake value in the primary tumor correlated with the presence of N2 disease. Positron emission tomography correctly identified supraclavicular N3 or M1 disease in 6 patients. Positron emission tomography does not identify the local extent of tumor or mediastinal nodal metastases reliably but detects extrathoracic metastases, thereby obviating inappropriate thoracotomy.

Peritoneal carcinomatosis: role of (18)F-FDG PET.,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",J. Nucl. Med.,2003-09-01,"Peritoneal carcinomatosis can be difficult to diagnose, as CT is insensitive, with peritoneal biopsy and lavage often subject to problems of sampling error. The aim of our study was to evaluate the role of (18)F-FDG PET in detecting peritoneal carcinomatosis in patients with stomach, ovarian, and adrenal cancer and mesothelioma and to compare the results with CT scans in the same patient group. Our secondary aim was to identify characteristic patterns of abdominal (18)F-FDG uptake in biopsy-proven peritoneal disease and to correlate these patterns with available histologic and anatomic findings after surgery and structural imaging. The medical records of 88 patients with stomach (n = 48), ovarian (n = 13), and adrenal cancer (n = 6) and mesothelioma (n = 21) were reviewed for the presence of peritoneal tumor on (18)F-FDG PET and CT scans. The results were correlated with either contemporaneous peritoneal biopsy or ascitic aspirate or with radiographic or clinical follow-up if histology was negative or unavailable. Of 24 patients with suspected peritoneal tumor, 17 had biopsy-proven findings of peritoneal disease. Of the 24 patients with suspected peritoneal tumor, (18)F-FDG PET was positive in 14 patients, with 1 of these scans being false-positive, CT was positive in 10 patients, and either PET or CT was positive in 18 patients. This yielded sensitivities of 57% (13/23), 42% (10/23), and 78% (18/23), with uniformly high positive predictive values of 93% (13/14), 100% (10/10), and 95% (18/19), respectively. We identified 2 distinctly abnormal scintigraphic patterns of focal and uniform (18)F-FDG uptake corresponding to nodular and diffuse peritoneal disease on pathologic examination.

"The epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD1839 selectively potentiates radiation response of human tumors in nude mice, with a marked improvement in therapeutic index.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2003-09-01,"The epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD1839 (Iressa) markedly potentiates the efficacy of many cytotoxic agents against several human cancer xenografts, irrespective of tumor EGFR expression levels. We subsequently investigated the extent to which ZD1839 might improve radiation therapy (RT) in similar animal models of human cancer within the limits of tolerance at a relevant organ site. We carried out studies of ZD1839 in in vivo models of human non-small cell lung (A549 and SK-LC-16) and breast (MDA-MB468) cancers and human mesothelioma (JMN). The tumors were implanted s.c. over the rib cage or on the most proximate breast and RT given ventral dorsally to the chest only, with mediastinal protection. After the tumor reached a palpable size (0.4-0.6 mm), treatment was initiated with the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of ZD1839 (150 mg/kg once daily x 5 for 2 successive weeks), RT (a total of 40 Gy given fractionally at 4 Gy once daily x 5 for 2 successive weeks), or both ZD1839 and RT. This level of RT induced no untoward effects in the mice and was effective (18-72%) in bringing about regression of the tumors with a few complete regressions. ZD1839 alone, given p.o. on the same schedule at its MTD (150 mg/kg), was modestly inhibitory (35-40%) to tumor growth. RT and ZD1839 could be given together at the same doses on the same schedule, resulting in marked regression (50-99%) and a large number of complete regressions of each of the tumors studied.

Chemotherapy for malignant pleural mesothelioma.,Clinical lung cancer,Clin Lung Cancer,2003-09-01,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma is an aggressive malignancy with no known single curative modality. Most patients are candidates for chemotherapy at some point in their treatment, but no standard regimen has been established. Several phase II single-agent and combination chemotherapy studies have been performed over the past 2 decades. Although the true impact of chemotherapy in mesothelioma remains to be determined, agents with consistent antitumor activity include doxorubicin, platinum agents, and antimetabolites. Combination chemotherapy is associated with higher response rates, but not necessarily longer median survivals. Large randomized trials, which are currently ongoing or have been performed in the past few years, will yield important answers in regard to the role of chemotherapy and the efficacy of various single and combination chemotherapy agents. Furthermore, the biologic and genetic studies of mesothelioma have identified several receptor tyrosine kinases that are aberrantly expressed in these tumors.

Phase I and pharmacokinetic trial of the novel taxane BMS-184476 administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion in combination with cisplatin every 21 days.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2003-11-01,"BMS-184476 is a 7-methylthiomethyl ether derivative of paclitaxel that displays potency superior to paclitaxel against tumor cells in culture and human tumor xenografts. It also inhibits the growth of paclitaxel-resistant human tumor cell lines with multidrug resistance mediated by either P-glycoprotein or mutated tubulin. Given the known synergy between taxanes and cisplatin in vitro and their clinical activity in combination, we performed a Phase I trial of BMS-184476 as a 1-h i.v. infusion followed by cisplatin every 21 days. Twenty-seven patients with a variety of solid tumors and good performance status received 116 cycles of therapy at BMS-184476 doses of 40-60 mg/m(2) together with cisplatin at 75 mg/m(2). The early observation of hypersensitivity reactions required prophylactic premedication in all patients. At the planned highest dose of BMS-184476 (60 mg/m(2)) and cisplatin (75 mg/m(2)), we observed dose-limiting toxicity in the form of neutropenia and diarrhea. Also at this level, five patients experienced grade 3 or worse nausea and vomiting. Aggressive prophylactic treatment eliminated the gastrointestinal toxicity. Mild to moderate peripheral neuropathy was infrequent, as was alopecia. Patient benefits included three partial responses in patients with mesothelioma, esophageal cancer, and head and neck cancer, and two additional minor responses. Plasma pharmacokinetic data are available for 23 patients treated at 40-60 mg/m(2). The mean maximum plasma concentrations and areas under the curves increased in a dose-related manner. The pharmacokinetics of BMS-184476 appeared independent of dose. The mean (+/- SE) values for clearance, volume of distribution at steady state, and the apparent terminal half-lives of the three dose groups during cycle 1 were 243 +/- 5 ml/min/m(2), 423 +/- 58 l/m(2), and 32.2 +/- 4.5 h, respectively.

Pilot study of Flt3 ligand comparing intraperitoneal with subcutaneous routes on hematologic and immunologic responses in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis and mesotheliomas.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2003-11-01,"This study compared the clinical toxicity and hematological effects of i.p. and s.c. administration of fms-like tyrosine kinase-3-ligand (Flt3-L; Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA), a truncated glycoprotein that increases dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes. Patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis or mesothelioma were randomly assigned to treatment with Flt3-L (25 micro g/kg, maximum 1500 micro g), i.p. or s.c., days 1-5 and 8-12, then changed to the alternative route at 4 weeks. Treatment was continued s.c. or i.p. at 8 weeks. Fifteen patients (14 evaluable) were randomized to receive i.p. (n = 8) or s.c. (n = 7) injections. Their median age was 55 years (range, 40-68 years). Primary tumors were as follows: ovarian/peritoneal cancer (n = 9); gastrointestinal cancer (n = 2); and mesothelioma (n = 4). Treatment was well tolerated without serious toxicity (24 i.p. cycles; 32 s.c. cycles). Treatment (i.p. or s.c.) resulted in significant increases in WBCs (WBC, monocytes, and Lin(-)DR(+) DCs), and platelets (during washout). Both interleukin (IL)-12(p70) and IL-10 were secreted by monocyte-derived DCs after in vitro exposure to maturation factors. Increased IL-12 versus IL-10 secretion responses and higher proportions of the CD11c(+) DC subset in post-Flt3-L specimens suggested a maturational shift toward the monocyte-derived DC phenotype had occurred. Three patients (2 with mesothelioma and 1 with gastrointestinal cancer) had stable disease for 8, 8, and 12+ months, respectively.

Pemetrexed in the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a review of the clinical data.,Clinical lung cancer,Clin Lung Cancer,2004-04-01,"Pemetrexed is a novel multitargeting antimetabolite that has first-line and second-line activity against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Phase II studies have shown significant efficacy and a favorable toxicity profile of the combination of pemetrexed plus platinum as first-line therapy for NSCLC. Second-line activity against NSCLC was demonstrated in a phase III trial comparing single-agent pemetrexed with docetaxel; in that trial, survival was comparable between these agents but side effects were significantly less for patients who received pemetrexed. Pemetrexed is also an active agent against mesothelioma. A phase III trial comparing pemetrexed plus cisplatin with cisplatin alone showed for the first time a regimen that improves survival in this disease and led to FDA approval of pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin for mesothelioma. As a radiosensitizer, pemetrexed has been well-tolerated when given concurrent with chest radiation, and a phase I study is under way assessing its tolerability in combination with carboplatin in this setting.

Measurement of mesothelioma on thoracic CT scans: a comparison of manual and computer-assisted techniques.,Medical physics,Med Phys,2004-05-01,"Our purpose in this study was to evaluate the variability of manual mesothelioma tumor thickness measurements in computed tomography (CT) scans and to assess the relative performance of six computerized measurement algorithms. The CT scans of 22 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma were collected. In each scan, an initial observer identified up to three sites in each of three CT sections at which tumor thickness measurements were to be made. At each site, five observers manually measured tumor thickness through a computer interface. Three observers repeated these measurements during three separate sessions. Inter- and intra-observer variability in the manual measurement of tumor thickness was assessed. Six automated measurement algorithms were developed based on the geometric relationship between a specified measurement site and the automatically extracted lung regions. Computer-generated measurements were compared with manual measurements. The tumor thickness measurements of different observers were highly correlated (r > or = 0.99); however, the 95% limits of agreement for relative inter-observer difference spanned a range of 30%. Tumor thickness measurements generated by the computer algorithms also correlated highly with the average of observer measurements (r > or = 0.93).

Adapting the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) to mesothelioma: using the LCSS-Meso conceptual model for validation.,Cancer,Cancer,2004-08-01,"The underpinning conceptual model for the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS), an instrument used to assess health-related quality of life in patients with lung cancer, has been described elsewhere. The patient-rated scale of the LCSS was modified slightly for patients with mesothelioma (LCSS-Meso), because no other mesothelioma-specific instrument was available. In the current methodologic study, the authors tested the conceptual model for the LCSS-Meso. Chemotherapy-naive patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma who were participating in two clinical trials of pemetrexed (ALIMTA; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) completed the scale twice before the start of therapy and once weekly during the trials. Three time points were analyzed: baseline, Day 40, and Day 82. Poisson regression was used to determine the contribution of predictive factors (i.e., symptoms) to the summary items (symptom distress, activity level, and global quality of life). The model was tested in 495 patients who had malignant pleural mesothelioma. More than 85% of patients reported pain, dyspnea, fatigue, and appetite loss. Pain, dyspnea, and fatigue were significant and stable predictors for all summary items; however, pain had a significant effect on global quality of life only through Day 40. Appetite loss was a significant and stable predictor of activity level and global quality of life. The explained variance for the model was 39-55%. Further support for the content validity of the LCSS-Meso was obtained, as nearly all patients validated that the symptoms described in the scale captured their disease experience.

Evidence against a role for SV40 infection in human mesotheliomas and high risk of false-positive PCR results owing to presence of SV40 sequences in common laboratory plasmids.,"Lancet (London, England)",Lancet,,"PCR-based evidence of infection by simian virus 40 (SV40) has been reported in varying proportions of pleural mesotheliomas and other tumours, but data are conflicting and reproducibility limited. During a study of SV40 in relation to homozygous deletion of CDKN2A in mesotheliomas, we became concerned by inconsistent results and therefore used several independent techniques to investigate SV40 in these tumours. High-quality DNA and RNA were extracted from 71 frozen mesothelioma samples. DNA PCR was done with four sets of primers for the SV40 T-antigen gene. RNA transcripts were examined by RT-PCR. The first two primer sets for DNA PCR gave positive results in proportions similar to those reported in positive studies (56-62%) but there were unusual reproducibility difficulties. These primers were in a region of the T-antigen gene (nucleotides 4100-4713) that is present in many common laboratory plasmids. In assays with PCR primers not included within that region, only four cases (6%) showed products but these were too faint to suggest clonal infection. Further PCR assays confirmed that the SV40 sequences in the tumour samples had a deletion found only in plasmids, not in native functional SV40. Review of previous studies showed a similar pattern of discrepancies between SV40 T-antigen DNA PCR results obtained with primers within and beyond the region 4100-4713. All 71 mesotheliomas were negative for T-antigen transcripts by RT-PCR, and lacked T-antigen-positive tumour cells by immunohistochemistry. Our data based on three independent experimental approaches do not support a significant role for SV40 in human mesotheliomas. The risk of false-positive results due to contamination by common laboratory plasmids containing SV40 sequences has been underestimated. Studies of SV40 based on PCR methods require careful primer design to reduce this risk. This paper presents several lines of evidence against the proposed link between SV40 infection and human mesotheliomas. Studies reporting a high prevalence of SV40 DNA in human tumours have been based on molecular assays prone to false-positive results. Because SV40 appears unlikely to have a major role, if any, in human mesotheliomas, clinicians should continue to consider asbestos exposure as the most likely and most thoroughly established aetiological factor in individuals with this cancer.",Journal Article,,155.0,PCR-based evidence of infection by simian virus 40 SV40 has been reported in varying proportions of pleural mesotheliomas and other tumours but data are conflicting and reproducibility limited During a study of SV40 in relation to homozygous deletion of CDKN2A in mesotheliomas we became concerned by inconsistent results and therefore used several independent techniques to investigate SV40 in these tumours High-quality DNA and RNA were extracted from 71 frozen samples DNA PCR was done with four sets of primers for the SV40 T-antigen gene RNA transcripts were examined by RT-PCR The first two primer sets for DNA PCR gave positive results in proportions similar to those reported in positive studies 56-62 but there were unusual reproducibility difficulties These primers were in a region of the T-antigen gene nucleotides 4100-4713 that is present in many common laboratory plasmids In assays with PCR primers not included within that region only four cases 6 showed products but these were too faint to suggest clonal infection Further PCR assays confirmed that the SV40 sequences in the tumour samples had a deletion found only in plasmids not in native functional SV40 Review of previous studies showed a similar pattern of discrepancies between SV40 T-antigen DNA PCR results obtained with primers within and beyond the region 4100-4713 All 71 mesotheliomas were negative for T-antigen transcripts by RT-PCR and lacked T-antigen-positive tumour cells by immunohistochemistry Our data based on three independent experimental approaches do not support a significant role for SV40 in human mesotheliomas The risk of false-positive results due to contamination by common laboratory plasmids containing SV40 sequences has been underestimated Studies of SV40 based on PCR methods require careful primer design to reduce this risk This paper presents several lines of evidence against the proposed link between SV40 infection and human mesotheliomas Studies reporting a high prevalence of SV40 DNA in human tumours have been based on molecular assays prone to false-positive results Because SV40 appears unlikely to have a major role if any in human mesotheliomas clinicians should continue to consider asbestos exposure as the most likely and most thoroughly established aetiological factor in individuals with this cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[604, 90, 241, 1, 930, 20, 27915, 1450, 327, 9734, 71, 85, 210, 4, 2990, 4117, 1, 2164, 11789, 2, 127, 1319, 84, 74, 32, 4274, 2, 4688, 383, 190, 8, 45, 1, 9734, 4, 2191, 6, 3189, 1528, 1, 3175, 4, 11789, 21, 3451, 9415, 20, 4923, 99, 2, 673, 95, 392, 306, 1092, 6, 963, 9734, 4, 46, 1319, 64, 372, 261, 2, 893, 11, 2484, 29, 792, 3015, 347, 261, 604, 10, 1822, 5, 294, 2270, 1, 10031, 9, 3, 9734, 102, 448, 145, 893, 2680, 11, 409, 20, 240, 604, 3, 157, 100, 9684, 2270, 9, 261, 604, 6421, 109, 99, 4, 4117, 288, 6, 135, 210, 4, 109, 94, 664, 744, 84, 125, 11, 4015, 4688, 4679, 46, 10031, 11, 4, 8, 1053, 1, 3, 102, 448, 145, 11381, 43731, 37776, 17, 16, 364, 4, 445, 186, 1624, 12473, 4, 1013, 5, 604, 10031, 44, 159, 262, 17, 1053, 158, 294, 140, 49, 224, 2766, 84, 46, 11, 5044, 24755, 6, 309, 1946, 930, 195, 604, 1013, 557, 17, 3, 9734, 2866, 4, 3, 770, 347, 42, 8, 1528, 204, 158, 4, 12473, 44, 4, 4646, 583, 9734, 206, 1, 698, 94, 224, 8, 288, 1177, 1, 7631, 59, 9734, 102, 448, 261, 604, 99, 683, 5, 10031, 262, 2, 1654, 3, 1053, 43731, 37776, 62, 792, 11789, 11, 199, 9, 102, 448, 2680, 20, 240, 604, 2, 5005, 102, 448, 109, 770, 37, 20, 888, 114, 74, 90, 23, 169, 306, 1560, 611, 1022, 44, 538, 8, 93, 200, 9, 9734, 4, 171, 11789, 3, 43, 1, 2133, 109, 99, 520, 6, 9866, 20, 186, 1624, 12473, 1101, 9734, 2866, 71, 85, 10585, 94, 1, 9734, 90, 23, 604, 636, 1353, 3465, 9684, 771, 6, 969, 26, 43, 26, 2817, 2740, 392, 285, 1, 241, 480, 3, 1587, 3460, 59, 9734, 930, 2, 171, 11789, 94, 1760, 8, 64, 1078, 1, 9734, 261, 4, 171, 1319, 47, 85, 90, 23, 219, 1013, 7104, 6, 2133, 109, 99, 408, 9734, 1233, 3568, 6, 47, 8, 458, 200, 492, 500, 4, 171, 11789, 1490, 257, 1906, 6, 2419, 15556, 645, 22, 3, 96, 322, 2, 96, 11576, 635, 33737, 161, 4, 869, 5, 26, 12]",2325.0,15451223,65
Selective activation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and -2 in pleural mesothelioma cells: association with distinct malignant phenotypes.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2004-10-01,"Molecular mechanisms active in transforming human pleural cells remain incompletely understood. Our previous microarray analysis of malignant pleural mesothelioma revealed alterations in components of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system, implicating this signaling axis in tumorigenesis. Therefore, in this current study, we characterized the molecular phenotype and investigated the key signaling pathways of the IGF system in malignant pleural mesothelioma specimens. For the major IGF components, we assessed mRNA abundance and total protein levels. We measured IGF-I ligand-dependent activation of signaling pathways downstream of the type I IGF receptor in a subset of malignant pleural mesothelioma cell lines and determined the corresponding biological consequences. At the transcriptional level, we observed consistent changes in IGF components that may contribute to a malignant phenotype. IGF-I stimulation of cells resulted in enhanced activation of type I IGF receptor and IRS adaptor proteins.

Patterns of failure following surgical resection for malignant pleural mesothelioma.,Thoracic surgery clinics,Thorac Surg Clin,2004-11-01,"The optimum therapeutic strategy for patients with localized malignant mesothelioma continues to evolve. For patients who are eligible candidates, surgical resection plays an important role. An encouraging 45% 5-year survival rate has been reported for patients with early-stage disease who undergo EPP and have the favorable features of epithelial histology and the absence of mediastinal lymph node involvement. Most patients present with more advanced disease, however, and the optimum local and systemic treatment for these patients has not been defined. No randomized trials evaluating the various surgical or adjuvant therapeutic approaches have been performed. Evaluation of treatment efficacy based on observed patterns of failure may suffer from treatment selection biases. Most studies also do not separate out the failure patterns based on the initial stage (clinical or pathologic) of the disease. Consequently, it is difficult to discern the potential impact of a given adjuvant therapy. Given these limitations, however, some consistent observations from the available data can be made. For patients who undergo P/D, local recurrence (within the surgically operated hemithorax) is the most common form of recurrence. Efforts to decrease the chance of local recurrence after P/D have included the use of intrapleural and intravenous chemotherapy, brachytherapy, and external beam radiation therapy. None of these adjuvant treatment trials was randomized, and when compared with historical controls, none of the treatments used suggested a consistent outcome benefit. After P/D, the use of radiation is limited by the potential toxicity of the underlying organs, most importantly, the intact lung. Doses required to treat mesothelioma effectively are above the doses that would lead to damage to the lung parenchyma. Cisplatin and mitomycin have been used as agents have modest activity against mesothelioma. The doses of cisplatin used may not have been optimal, although they were based on prior pharmacokinetic studies. Alternative approaches for patients who undergo P/D, such as the use of escalating doses of heated intrapleural cisplatin (given with a renal protecting agent, sodium thiosulfate, which provides the opportunity to deliver higher doses of chemotherapy), are being pursued by Sugarbaker et al. The availability of more active systemic chemotherapy agents or other intrapleural agents also may offer better therapeutic options for patients who undergo P/D. Recently, Vogelzang et al presented the findings of a large randomized study that compared cisplatin/premetrexed to cisplatin and demonstrated an improvement in response rate (41% for cisplatin/pemetrexed versus 19% for cisplatin) and median survival (12.1 versus 9.3 months, respectively; P = 0.020). Other chemotherapy regimens with encouraging activity in mesothelioma include the combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine, with response rates ranging from 16% to 48%. From a review of available data, patients with mesothelioma who have undergone P/D (with or without intrapleural chemotherapy) who are evaluated at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women's Hospital are offered therapy with systemic chemotherapy alone. After P/D, radiation is used only for palliative treatment. Patients who have undergone P/D are also appropriate candidates to receive chemotherapy or other novel therapeutic strategies being evaluated in clinical trials. For patients who have undergone EPP, the pattern of recurrence is predominantly a combination of local and distant failure (Table 1). The local recurrence rates, however, seem to be lower than rates seen after P/D. This observation may represent a shift of the natural history of the disease. Metastatic mesothelioma is often seen late in the course of the disease, but it may become the dominant source of disease after aggressive local surgical management. Many studies define abdominal recurrence as a site of distant recurrence, although this may represent transdiaphragmatic extension of the pleural mesothelioma. Advances in local therapy also may decrease the rate of abdominal recurrences. True distant recurrences (bone, central nervous system, contralateral hemithorax) remain less common. The lowest rate of local recurrence (13%), with a 4% local-only recurrence rate, was seen in the study by Rusch et al, who used 54 Gy hemithorax radiation as adjuvant therapy. This is the lowest rate of local recurrence after an EPP that has been reported. Baldini et al reported a 50% local recurrence rate, with a 13% local-only rate, after trimodality therapy. One possibility for the differences between these two reports is the lower dose of radiation (30.6 Gy) used in the latter study. In the study by Rusch et al, distant failures predominate, and the patients are appropriate candidates for systemic chemotherapy, which could be administered either as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. Kestenholz et al currently are performing a phase II clinical trial of neoadjuvant cisplatin and gemcitabine administered for three cycles followed by EPP and adjuvant radiation therapy. A similar approach also is being pursued in an ongoing clinical trial using neoadjuvant cisplatin/pemetrexed for four cycles before EPP followed by 54 Gy of adjuvant hemithorax radiation. Alternatively, patients who have undergone EPP could be treated with adjuvant chemotherapy in addition to adjuvant radiation therapy. Currently, patients evaluated at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women's Hospital who have undergone EPP are offered adjuvant chemotherapy followed by hemithorax radiation to 54 Gy in an effort to maximize local and distant control rates. Further clinical studies are needed for all patients with mesothelioma to define the optimum surgery and duration and types of adjuvant therapy. The appropriate multimodality approaches most likely will differ based on disease stage, histology, and patient performance status. intrapleural chemotheraphy treatments.

The expression of MUC1 and CK17 was restricted to pancreatic ductal carcinoma (41 of 46, 89%; 38 of 46, 83%, respectively), the ampullary carcinoma of pancreatobiliary origin (6 of 6, 100%; 5 of 6, 83%, respectively), and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (20 of 24, 83%; 17 of 24, 71%, respectively). More than 50% of cases of pancreatobiliary adenocarcinomas showed diffuse cytoplasmic CK17 positivity. In contrast, less than 5% cases (8 of 184) of extra-pancreatobiliary nonmucinous adenocarcinomas expressed CK17, and only 3 of them showed diffuse CK17 positivity. The expression of MUC2 and CDX2 was restricted to the intestinal, mucinous, and signet-ring cell-type adenocarcinomas of duodenal papillary origin (9 of 11, 82%; 11 of 11, 100%, respectively). MUC2 was rarely expressed in pancreatic ductal carcinoma (1 of 46, 2%) and was negative in the ampullary carcinoma of pancreatobiliary origin and in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. A heterogeneous CDX2 staining pattern was seen in 1 of 6 cases of the ampullary carcinoma of pancreatobiliary origin (17%), 5 of 24 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (21%), and 10 of 46 (22%) pancreatic ductal carcinomas. In contrast, all 11 cases of the intestinal, mucinous, and signet-ring cell-type adenocarcinomas of duodenal papillary origin showed homogeneous CDX2 nuclear positivity. We concluded that CK17 is a useful marker in separating pancreatobiliary adenocarcinomas from extra-pancreatobiliary nonmucinous adenocarcinomas, including adenocarcinomas from the colon, breast, gynecologic organs, stomach, lung, prostate, thyroid, kidney, and adrenal gland, and malignant mesothelioma. MUC1+/CK17+ can be used as positive markers for pancreatic ductal carcinomas, the ampullary carcinoma of pancreatobiliary origin, and cholangiocarcinomas with positive predictive values of 76%, 83%, and 58%, respectively. MUC2+/CDX2+ can be used as positive markers for the intestinal-type adenocarcinoma of duodenal papillary origin with a positive predictive value of 82%.",Journal Article,5439.0,138.0,Pancreatobiliary and ampulla of Vater adenocarcinomas frequently metastasize to regional lymph nodes or and are difficult to diagnose because they lack specific immunohistochemical markers We studied the expression of cytokeratin 7 CK7 cytokeratin 17 CK17 cytokeratin 20 CK20 CDX2 mucin 1 MUC1 mucin 2 MUC2 and mucin 5AC MUC5AC in 46 cases of ductal carcinoma 18 ampulla of Vater adenocarcinomas and 24 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas The expression of MUC1 and CK17 was restricted to ductal carcinoma 41 of 46 89 38 of 46 83 respectively the ampullary carcinoma of pancreatobiliary origin 6 of 6 100 5 of 6 83 respectively and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma 20 of 24 83 17 of 24 71 respectively More than 50 of cases of pancreatobiliary adenocarcinomas showed diffuse cytoplasmic CK17 positivity In contrast less than 5 cases 8 of 184 of extra-pancreatobiliary nonmucinous adenocarcinomas expressed CK17 and only 3 of them showed diffuse CK17 positivity The expression of MUC2 and CDX2 was restricted to the intestinal mucinous and signet-ring cell-type adenocarcinomas of duodenal papillary origin 9 of 11 82 11 of 11 100 respectively MUC2 was rarely expressed in ductal carcinoma 1 of 46 2 and was negative in the ampullary carcinoma of pancreatobiliary origin and in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma A heterogeneous CDX2 staining pattern was seen in 1 of 6 cases of the ampullary carcinoma of pancreatobiliary origin 17 5 of 24 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas 21 and 10 of 46 22 ductal carcinomas In contrast all 11 cases of the intestinal mucinous and signet-ring cell-type adenocarcinomas of duodenal papillary origin showed homogeneous CDX2 nuclear positivity We concluded that CK17 is a useful marker in separating pancreatobiliary adenocarcinomas from extra-pancreatobiliary nonmucinous adenocarcinomas including adenocarcinomas from the gynecologic organs and adrenal gland and malignant MUC1+/CK17+ can be used as positive markers for ductal carcinomas the ampullary carcinoma of pancreatobiliary origin and cholangiocarcinomas with positive predictive values of 76 83 and 58 respectively MUC2+/CDX2+ can be used as positive markers for the intestinal-type adenocarcinoma of duodenal papillary origin with a positive predictive value of 82,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[9206, 2, 12837, 1, 14777, 1586, 746, 5769, 6, 951, 263, 502, 15, 2, 32, 1740, 6, 6073, 408, 491, 926, 112, 1382, 525, 21, 656, 3, 55, 1, 4292, 67, 12097, 4292, 269, 24794, 4292, 179, 10821, 9934, 5258, 14, 4994, 5258, 18, 17300, 2, 5258, 43863, 22269, 4, 641, 140, 1, 1258, 134, 203, 12837, 1, 14777, 1586, 2, 259, 3022, 9386, 3, 55, 1, 4994, 2, 24794, 10, 2016, 6, 1258, 134, 605, 1, 641, 887, 519, 1, 641, 852, 106, 3, 6762, 134, 1, 9206, 1938, 49, 1, 49, 394, 33, 1, 49, 852, 106, 2, 3022, 2126, 179, 1, 259, 852, 269, 1, 259, 792, 106, 80, 76, 212, 1, 140, 1, 9206, 1586, 224, 1388, 2828, 24794, 1887, 4, 748, 299, 76, 33, 140, 66, 1, 5894, 1, 3420, 9206, 10209, 1586, 570, 24794, 2, 158, 27, 1, 1370, 224, 1388, 24794, 1887, 3, 55, 1, 17300, 2, 9934, 10, 2016, 6, 3, 3077, 2391, 2, 5489, 4091, 31, 267, 1586, 1, 4748, 1796, 1938, 83, 1, 175, 878, 175, 1, 175, 394, 106, 17300, 10, 2416, 570, 4, 1258, 134, 14, 1, 641, 18, 2, 10, 199, 4, 3, 6762, 134, 1, 9206, 1938, 2, 4, 3022, 2126, 8, 1564, 9934, 1029, 1177, 10, 527, 4, 14, 1, 49, 140, 1, 3, 6762, 134, 1, 9206, 1938, 269, 33, 1, 259, 3022, 9386, 239, 2, 79, 1, 641, 350, 1258, 826, 4, 748, 62, 175, 140, 1, 3, 3077, 2391, 2, 5489, 4091, 31, 267, 1586, 1, 4748, 1796, 1938, 224, 5642, 9934, 928, 1887, 21, 4724, 17, 24794, 16, 8, 999, 952, 4, 13366, 9206, 1586, 29, 3420, 9206, 10209, 1586, 141, 1586, 29, 3, 1512, 2285, 2, 2987, 2326, 2, 393, 4994, 24794, 122, 40, 95, 22, 109, 525, 9, 1258, 826, 3, 6762, 134, 1, 9206, 1938, 2, 9386, 5, 109, 464, 1030, 1, 846, 852, 2, 717, 106, 17300, 9934, 122, 40, 95, 22, 109, 525, 9, 3, 3077, 267, 449, 1, 4748, 1796, 1938, 5, 8, 109, 464, 549, 1, 878]",2252.0,15725805,37

Irinotecan for malignant mesothelioma A phase II trial by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B.,"Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",Lung Cancer,2005-02-16,"The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) conducted a multi-center phase II trial to evaluate the activity of irinotecan in malignant mesothelioma (CALGB protocol 9733). Twenty-eight patients accrued between January 1998 and January 1999 received irinotecan 125 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 90 min weekly for 4 weeks, every 6 weeks. Eligibility included a performance status of 0-2 by CALGB criteria, and no prior chemotherapy. Twenty-five patients had pleural mesothelioma; two patients had peritoneal mesothelioma, and one patient had pericardial mesothelioma. Sixty-one percent of patients had epithelial histology. There were no complete or partial responders. Thirty-three percent of patients had stable disease and 52% were shown to have progressive disease at the first reassessment. One patient was not evaluable for response. Median survival from study entry was 9.3 months (95% CI 4.5-13.2 months); 1-year survival was estimated at 46% (95% CI 28-65%). Toxicity was moderately severe. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities included neutropenia in 28% of patients, lymphopenia in 43%, and diarrhea in 18%. Three patients died of treatment-related toxicities.

Thirty-three patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma and free-flowing pleural effusions received intrapleural L-NDDP once every 3 weeks at a dose of 450 mg/m2. Thoracoscopic evaluation with pleural biopsies was performed before therapy and then after every two cycles. The primary end point was pathologic response as determined by thoracoscopic biopsy. After at least two cycles, post-treatment pleural biopsy analysis was negative in 14 patients for a pathologic response rate of 42% (95% CI, 25% to 61%). Median survival was 11.2 months. There were three treatment-related deaths secondary to peritonitis, cellulitis at the thoracoscopy site, and empyema. Grade 3 nonhematologic toxicities included infection, fever, dyspnea, and anorexia, which occurred in five (15%), one (3%), one (3%), and one (3%) patients, respectively. There were no grade 4 nonhematologic toxicities. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurred in five (15%), three (9%), and two (6%) patients, respectively. Two patients with pathologic responses subsequently underwent pleural decortication.

Implications of P16/CDKN2A deletion in pleural mesotheliomas.,"Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",Lung Cancer,2005-04-14,"Homozygous deletion of P16/CDKN2A is found in approximately 75% of mesotheliomas amd may be the most common genetic alteration in this cancer. In terms of diagnostic applications, its high prevalence makes it a useful marker to distinguish malignant mesothelial cells from benign reactive ones in pleural fluid cytologic preparations. In terms of prognosis, P16/CDKN2A loss is associated with more aggressive clinical behavior in mesotheliomas. The homozygous co-deletion of MTAP, encoding the enzyme methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, in approximately 90% of mesotheliomas with P16/CDKN2A loss has potential therapeutic applications because MTAP-deficient tumors may be responsive to inhibitors of de novo AMP synthesis.

This study was designed to identify novel targets for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic approaches. The expression and functional significance of the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB4 was studied in vitro and in a murine model of mesothelioma. EphB4 was highly expressed in mesothelioma cell lines and primary tumor tissues but not in normal mesothelium. Knockdown of EphB4 using small interfering RNA and antisense oligodeoxynucleotide showed reduction in cell survival, migration, and invasion. EphB4 knockdown initiated a caspase-8-mediated apoptosis and down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-xl. EphB4 knockdown also resulted in reduced phosphorylation of Akt and down-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 transcription. In addition, murine tumor xenograft studies using EphB4 oligodeoxynucleotides showed a marked reduction in tumor growth accompanied by a specific decline in EphB4 protein levels, reduced cell division, apoptosis in tumor tissue, and decreased microvascular density.

Measuring quality of life in patients with pleural mesothelioma using a modified version of the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS): psychometric properties of the LCSS-Meso.,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,Support Care Cancer,2005-07-06,"Health-related quality of life (QOL) assessment is a key component in patient assessment and the development of therapies for malignant pleural mesothelioma. However, no mesothelioma-specific instrument was available. The Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS), a site-specific instrument used to assess QOL in patients with lung cancer, was identified as an instrument that could be appropriate. A modified nine-item patient-reported and six-item observer-reported LCSS was incorporated into two clinical trials of pemetrexed in patients with pleural mesothelioma. Basic psychometric properties of feasibility, reliability, and validity were tested. Properties were stable or enhanced by deletion of the hemoptysis item. Feasibility was demonstrated with a high completion rate of 90% by 512 patients. Reliability was acceptable, with good internal consistency for the eight-item measure (alpha coefficient=0.86) and reasonably good for the five-item observer measure (alpha coefficient=0.66); there was also good stability for the patient measure using test-retest (r=0.87). Content validity was supported by a literature review and patient self-report of presenting symptoms (>90% of patients had three or more symptoms). Construct validity was well supported by finding better scores in the higher performance status groups and greater symptom improvement in patients with tumor response, good concordance with the LCSS conceptual model and good explanation of variance for summation items, and a high degree of convergence between the patient and observer forms (r=0.57).

Therapeutic targeting of multiple signaling pathways in malignant pleural mesothelioma.,Oncology,Oncology,2005-07-13,"The majority of malignant pleural mesotheliomas (MPMs) aberrantly express the epidermal growth factor receptor (ErbB1). We examined the efficacy of GW572016 (lapatinib), a dual inhibitor of ErbB1/ErbB2 with a panel of 10 MPM cell lines. Two of the 10 MPM cell lines, H2373 and H2452, underwent G1/S cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition with an IC(50) of 1 muM and 0.8 muM, respectively. There was no relationship between the presence or the amount of ErbB1, phospho-ErbB1, phospho-ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, phospho-Akt, and Akt or the ability of lapatinib to inhibit phospho-ErbB1 in these cell lines compared to those that did not respond to lapatinib. The sensitive cell lines had a time-dependent decrease in phospho-Akt and/or ERK1/2, and an increase in p27 and when treated with lapatinib. The combination of lapatinib with U0126, LY294002 or rapamycin caused greater growth inhibition than either drug alone in the sensitive cell lines while this did not occur in the resistant cell lines. Our findings suggest that ErbB1 alone is a therapeutic target for the minority of mesotheliomas and that combining ErbB1 inhibitors with signal transduction inhibitors in mesothelioma will enhance their effectiveness.

Evaluation of semiautomated measurements of mesothelioma tumor thickness on CT scans.,Academic radiology,Acad Radiol,2005-10-01,"To evaluate the clinical acceptability of semiautomated methods for the measurement of mesothelioma tumor thickness in computed tomography (CT) scans. A computer interface was developed to allow the acquisition of semiautomated mesothelioma tumor thickness measurements, which require the manual selection of a point along the outer margin of the tumor in a CT section. After application of an automated lung segmentation method, the computer automatically identifies a corresponding point along the inner margin of the tumor (as represented by the lung boundary), constructs a line segment between the manually selected outer tumor margin point and the computer-determined inner tumor margin point, and computes tumor thickness as the length of this line segment. Three radiologists and oncologists independently reviewed line segments representing the semiautomated measurements generated by three different algorithms at 134 measurement sites in the CT scans of 22 mesothelioma patients. The observers either accepted a measurement line segment or modified it through the interface. Differences between the initial semiautomated measurements and the measurements as modified by the observers were analyzed. The frequency with which observers accepted the semiautomated measurements without modification was as high as 86%. Of all measurements across all observers and methods (1,206 measurements), 89% were changed by 2 mm or less. We have developed semiautomated methods to measure mesothelioma tumor thickness. The potential of these methods has been demonstrated through an observer study.

Cisplatin-induced GADD34 upregulation potentiates oncolytic viral therapy in the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma.,Cancer biology & therapy,Cancer Biol. Ther.,2006-01-12,"NV1066, a replication-competent oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) attenuated by a deletion in the gene gamma(1)34.5, preferentially replicates in and kills malignant cells. gamma(1)34.5 encodes ICP34.5, a viral protein essential for productive replication, which has homology with mammalian stress response induced GADD34 (growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein). We hypothesized that cisplatin upregulates GADD34 expression, which enhances NV1066 replication and oncolysis. Ten human malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) cell lines were infected with NV1066 at multiplicities of infection (MOI; ratio of viral particles per tumor cell) 0.005 to 0.8 in vitro, with and without cisplatin (1 to 4 microM). In the MPM cell line VAMT, viral replication was determined by plaque assay, cell kill by lactate dehydrogenase assay, and GADD34 induction by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot. Synergistic efficacy was confirmed by the isobologram and combination index methods of Chou-Talalay. GADD34 upregulation by cisplatin was inhibited with GADD34 siRNA to further confirm the synergistic efficacy dependence with GADD34. Combination therapy with NV1066 and cisplatin showed strong synergism in epithelioid (H-2452, H-Meso), sarcomatoid (H-2373, H-28), and biphasic (JMN, Meso-9, MSTO-211H) MPM cell lines, and an additive effect in others. In VAMT cells combination therapy enhanced viral replication 4 to 11-fold (p < 0.01) and cell kill 2 to 3-fold (p < 0.01). Significant dose reductions for both agents (2 to 600-fold) were achieved over a wide range of therapeutic-effect levels (LD50-LD99) without compromising cell kill. Synergistic cytotoxicity correlated with GADD34 upregulation (2 to 4-fold, p < 0.01) and was eliminated following transfection with GADD34 siRNA. Cisplatin-induced GADD34 expression selectively enhanced the cytotoxicity of the gamma(1)34.5-deficient oncolytic virus, NV1066.

Inhibition of the met receptor in mesothelioma.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2005-11-01,"Expression of the Met receptor and its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), has been observed in 74% to 100% and 40% to 85% of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) specimens, respectively. HGF stimulation has been shown to enhance MPM cell proliferation, migration, cell scattering, and invasiveness. To investigate a potential therapeutic role for the Met receptor in MPM, we examined the effects of PHA-665752, a specific small-molecule inhibitor of the Met receptor tyrosine kinase, in a panel of 10 MPM cell lines. Two of the cell lines, H2461 and JMN-1B, exhibited autocrine HGF production as measured by ELISA (3.9 and 10.5 ng/mL, respectively, versus <0.05 ng/mL in other cell lines). Evaluation of PHA-665752 across the 10 MPM cell lines indicated that despite Met expression in all cell lines, only in cell lines that exhibited a Met/HGF autocrine loop, H2461 and JMN-1B, did PHA-665752 inhibit growth with an IC(50) of 1 and 2 micromol/L, respectively. No activating mutations in Met were detected in any of the cell lines. Consistent with observed growth inhibition, PHA-665752 caused cell cycle arrest at G(1)-S boundary accompanied by a dose-dependent decrease in phosphorylation of Met, p70S6K, Akt, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. Growth of H2461 cells was also inhibited by neutralizing antibodies to HGF and by RNA interference knockdown of the Met receptor, confirming that growth inhibition observed was through a Met-dependent mechanism. PHA-665752 also reduced MPM in vitro cell migration and invasion.

Extended surgical staging for potentially resectable malignant pleural mesothelioma.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2005-12-01,"Extrapleural pneumonectomy for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a high-risk procedure, and patients require careful preoperative staging to exclude advanced disease. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography are useful staging modalities, but do not reliably identify contralateral mediastinal involvement or transdiaphragmatic invasion. We evaluated the role of extended surgical staging procedures, which generally includes a combination of laparoscopy, peritoneal lavage, and mediastinoscopy, to more precisely stage patients with MPM. One hundred eighteen patients with MPM, deemed clinically and radiologically resectable, underwent extended surgical staging. Mediastinoscopy was performed in 111 patients, laparoscopy in 109 patients, and peritoneal lavage in 78 patients. Ten (9.2%) patients had gross evidence of transdiaphragmatic or peritoneal involvement. Peritoneal lavage was positive for metastatic MPM in 2 (2.6%) patients, neither of whom had obvious transdiaphragmatic invasion. Ipsilateral mediastinal nodes contained metastatic tumor in 10 of 62 (16.1%) patients. Contralateral nodes were positive in 4 of 111 (3.6%) patients. Of the patients who underwent biopsy of both ipsilateral and contralateral mediastinal nodes, and who had complete pathologic staging after extrapleural pneumonectomy (n = 46), 14 (30.4%) had N2-positive nodes. Only 5 of these patients were correctly identified by mediastinoscopy (sensitivity 36%, accuracy 80%). Extended surgical staging identified 16 (13.6%) patients who had contralateral nodal involvement, transdiaphragmatic invasion, or positive peritoneal cytology. Extended surgical staging defines an important subset of patients with unresectable MPM not identified by imaging.

Molecular biology of malignant mesothelioma: a review.,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,Hematol. Oncol. Clin. North Am.,2005-12-01,"Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an uncommon tumor with high mortality and morbidity rates. It arises from mesothelial cells that line the pleural, pericardial, peritoneal, and testicular cavities. This is a disease with an indolent course because tumors arise 20 to 40 years after exposure to an inciting agent. Extensive research has shown that mesothelial cells are transformed into MM cells through various chromosomal and cellular pathway defects. These changes alter the normal cells' ability to survive, proliferate, and metastasize. This article discusses the alterations that occur in transforming normal mesothelial cells into MM.

Functional analysis of c-Met/hepatocyte growth factor pathway in malignant pleural mesothelioma.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2006-01-01,"c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) has not been extensively studied in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). In this study, c-Met was overexpressed and activated in most of the mesothelioma cell lines tested. Expression in MPM tissues by immunohistochemistry was increased (82%) in MPM in general compared with normal. c-Met was internalized with its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in H28 MPM cells, with robust expression of c-Met. Serum circulating HGF was twice as high in mesothelioma patients as in healthy controls. There was a differential growth response and activation of AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in response to HGF for the various cell lines. Dose-dependent inhibition (IC50 < 2.5 micromol/L) of cell growth in mesothelioma cell lines, but not in H2052, H2452, and nonmalignant MeT-5A (IC50 > 10 micromol/L), was observed with the small-molecule c-Met inhibitor SU11274. Furthermore, migration of H28 cells was blocked with both SU11274 and c-Met small interfering RNA. Abrogation of HGF-induced c-Met and downstream signaling was seen in mesothelioma cells. Of the 43 MPM tissues and 7 cell lines, we have identified mutations within the semaphorin domain (N375S, M431V, and N454I), the juxtamembrane domain (T1010I and G1085X), and an alternative spliced product with deletion of the exon 10 of c-Met in some of the samples. Interestingly, we observed that the cell lines H513 and H2596 harboring the T1010I mutation exhibited the most dramatic reduction of cell growth with SU11274 when compared with wild-type H28 and nonmalignant MeT-5A cells.

Imaging and therapy of malignant pleural mesothelioma using replication-competent herpes simplex viruses.,The journal of gene medicine,J Gene Med,2006-05-01,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive cancer that is refractory to current treatment modalities. Oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (HSV) used for gene therapy are genetically engineered, replication-competent viruses that selectively target tumor cells while sparing normal host tissue. The localized nature, the potential accessibility and the relative lack of distant metastasis make MPM a particularly suitable disease for oncolytic viral therapy. The infectivity, selective replication, vector spread and cytotoxic ability of three oncolytic HSV: G207, NV1020 and NV1066, were tested against eleven pathological types of MPM cell lines including those that are resistant to radiation therapy, gemcitabine or cisplatin. The therapeutic efficacy and the effect on survival of NV1066 were confirmed in a murine MPM model. All three oncolytic HSV were highly effective against all the MPM cell lines tested. Even at very low concentrations of MOI 0.01 (MOI: multiplicity of viral infection, ratio of viral particles per cancer cell), HSV were highly effective against MPM cells that are resistant to radiation, gemcitabine and cisplatin.

Modeling of mesothelioma growth demonstrates weaknesses of current response criteria.,"Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",Lung Cancer,2006-03-10,"Applicability of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) to the geometry of mesothelioma has been recently investigated. A ""modified RECIST"" measurement technique developed for mesothelioma proposes measurement of tumor thickness rather than maximum diameter. This study evaluated the volumetric consistency of the RECIST response criteria as applied to the modified RECIST measurement technique. Geometric models were developed to simulate mesothelioma growth, and measurements of these models were calculated. Relationships between change in model measurements and corresponding change in model volume were derived and evaluated. Application of the RECIST response criteria to the typical spherical tumor model results in partial response (PR) classification based on a 66% volume decrease and progressive disease (PD) based on a 73% volume increase; for mesothelioma model thickness measurements, the RECIST criteria result in PR classification based on a 30% volume decrease and PD based on a 20% volume increase. Alternative response criteria for mesothelioma thickness measurement (-66% for PR, +74% for PD) achieve volumetric equivalence with the RECIST criteria for spherical tumor measurement.

Global gene expression profiling of pleural mesotheliomas: overexpression of aurora kinases and P16/CDKN2A deletion as prognostic factors and critical evaluation of microarray-based prognostic prediction.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2006-03-01,"Most gene expression profiling studies of mesothelioma have been based on relatively small sample numbers, limiting their statistical power. We did Affymetrix U133A microarray analysis on 99 pleural mesotheliomas, in which multivariate analysis showed advanced-stage, sarcomatous histology and P16/CDKN2A homozygous deletion to be significant independent adverse prognostic factors. Comparison of the expression profiles of epithelioid versus sarcomatous mesotheliomas identified many genes significantly overexpressed among the former, including previously unrecognized ones, such as uroplakins and kallikrein 11, both confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Examination of the gene expression correlates of survival showed that more aggressive mesotheliomas expressed higher levels of Aurora kinases A and B and functionally related genes involved in mitosis and cell cycle control. Independent confirmation of the negative effect of Aurora kinase B was obtained by immunohistochemistry in a separate patient cohort. A role for Aurora kinases in the aggressive behavior of mesotheliomas is of potential clinical interest because of the recent development of small-molecule inhibitors. We then used our data to develop microarray-based predictors of 1 year survival; these achieved a maximal accuracy of 68% in cross-validation. However, this was inferior to prognostic prediction based on standard clinicopathologic variables and P16/CDNK2A status (accuracy, 73%), and adding the microarray model to the latter did not improve overall accuracy. Finally, we evaluated three recently published microarray-based outcome prediction models, but their accuracies ranged from 63% to 67%, consistently lower than reported.

Phase I to II study of pleurectomy/decortication and intraoperative intracavitary hyperthermic cisplatin lavage for mesothelioma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2006-04-01,"To evaluate morbidity, mortality, maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), and outcome of intraoperative intracavitary hyperthermic cisplatin lavage in patients undergoing pleurectomy for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Sixty-one patients were prospectively registered. Forty-four resectable patients with MPM underwent pleurectomy, followed by a 1-hour lavage of the resection cavity with dose-escalated cisplatin (50, 100, 150, 175, 200, 225, and 250 mg/m2) at 42 degrees C and then intravenous sodium thiosulfate (16 g/m2 over 6 hours). Survival estimates were compared using the log-rank test and proportional hazards regression. Median age was 71 years (range, 50 to 82 years). Twenty-four patients had epithelial tumors, and 20 had sarcomatous or mixed histology. Postoperative mortality was 11% (five of 44 patients). Dose-limiting renal toxicity occurred at 250 mg/m2, establishing the MTD at 225 mg/m2. Other morbidity included atrial fibrillation (14 of 44 patients, 32%) and deep venous thrombosis (four of 44 patients, 9%). Median survival time of all registered patients was 9 months, and the median survival time of resected patients was 13 months. Survival estimates differed significantly for resectable patients exposed to low doses (50 to 150 mg/m2; n = 9; median, 6 months) versus high doses (175 to 250 mg/m2; n = 35; median, 18 months) of hyperthermic cisplatin (P = .0019); recurrence-free interval also differed significantly (4 v 9 months, respectively; P < .0001). Low dose level (relative risk = 3.418) and nonepithelial histology (relative risk = 2.336) were independent risk factors for poor survival.

The risk of secondary malignancies over 30 years after the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2006-07-01,"Survivors of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) are at increased risk for developing secondary malignancies. For the current study, the authors quantitated this risk in a group of NHL survivors over 30 years of follow-up. Standardized incidence ratios (observed-to-expected [O/E] ratio) and absolute excess risk of secondary malignancies were assessed in 77,876 patients who were diagnosed with NHL between 1973 and 2001 from centers that participated in the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. There were 5638 patients who developed secondary malignancies, significantly more than the endemic rate (O/E, 1.14; P < .001). Overall, irradiated patients had a similar risk of secondary malignancies compared with unirradiated patients (relative risk, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-1.10; P = .21). Irradiated patients had excess risk for sarcomas, breast cancers, and mesothelioma compared with unirradiated survivors (P < .05). Patients age <25 years at the time of their NHL diagnosis had the highest relative increased risk (no radiation: O/E, 2.1; P < .05; radiation: O/E, 4.51; P < .05). Overall, no statistical difference was observed for secondary cancer incidence between females and males (O/E, 1.12 vs. 1.15, respectively). Female survivors of NHL were less likely to develop breast cancer than the general population (O/E, 0.85; P < .05), but women age <25 years at the time of their NHL diagnosis were more likely to develop breast cancer (no radiation: O/E, 2.1; P < .05; radiation: O/E, 4.51; P < .05).

Fatal pneumonitis associated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy for mesothelioma.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2006-07-01,"To describe the initial experience at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Brigham and Women's Hospital with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) as adjuvant therapy after extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) and adjuvant chemotherapy. The medical records of patients treated with IMRT after EPP and adjuvant chemotherapy were retrospectively reviewed. IMRT was given to a dose of 54 Gy to the clinical target volume in 1.8 Gy daily fractions. Treatment was delivered with a dynamic multileaf collimator using a sliding window technique. Eleven of 13 patients received heated intraoperative cisplatin chemotherapy (225 mg/m(2)). Two patients received neoadjuvant intravenous cisplatin/pemetrexed, and 10 patients received adjuvant cisplatin/pemetrexed chemotherapy after EPP but before radiation therapy. All patients received at least 2 cycles of intravenous chemotherapy. The contralateral lung was limited to a V20 (volume of lung receiving 20 Gy or more) of 20% and a mean lung dose (MLD) of 15 Gy. All patients underwent fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) for staging, and any FDG-avid areas in the hemithorax were given a simultaneous boost of radiotherapy to 60 Gy. Statistical comparisons were done using two-sided t test. Thirteen patients were treated with IMRT from December 2004 to September 2005. Six patients developed fatal pneumonitis after treatment. The median time from completion of IMRT to the onset of radiation pneumonitis was 30 days (range 5-57 days). Thirty percent of patients (4 of 13) developed acute Grade 3 nausea and vomiting. One patient developed acute Grade 3 thrombocytopenia. The median V20, MLD, and V5 (volume of lung receiving 5 Gy or more) for the patients who developed pneumonitis was 17.6% (range, 15.3-22.3%), 15.2 Gy (range, 13.3-17 Gy), and 98.6% (range, 81-100%), respectively, as compared with 10.9% (range, 5.5-24.7%) (p = 0.08), 12.9 Gy (range, 8.7-16.9 Gy) (p = 0.07), and 90% (range, 66-98.3%) (p = 0.20), respectively, for the patients who did not develop pneumonitis.

Effects of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor inhibition in mesothelioma. Thoracic Surgery Directors Association Resident Research Award.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2006-09-01,"Malignant mesothelioma is a devastating disease with a poor prognosis. Recent data have shown that insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) may play a role in oncogenic signaling. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of a novel IGF-1R inhibitor, NVP-AEW541, on cell growth and IGF associated pathways. Malignant mesothelioma cell lines, H2373 and H2461, previously shown to activate the IGF pathway were grown in culture. The adherent cells, initially plated at 5 x 10(5) cells/plate, were treated for 72 hours, in triplicate, with varying concentration of NVP-AEW541 (0, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 microM). Viable cells were counted every 24 hours. Additionally, separate cultures in serum-free medium were treated with NVP-AEW541, then stimulated with IGF and lysates collected for immunoblot analysis. In both cell lines, 0, 1, 5, and 10 microM showed an inhibitory or static effect, while 20 and 50 microM were cidal. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that phosphorylation of IGF-1R was inhibited by NVP-AEW541 at higher concentration. Phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt, downstream IGF pathway mediators, were also shown to be repressed by drug treatment. NVP-AEW541 has a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on mesothelioma cells in culture. NVP-AEW541 acts by inhibition of IGF-1R phosphorylation. Inhibition effects phosphorylation of downstream mediators in a dose-dependent fashion. Inhibition of the IGF pathway decreases viability of mesothelioma cell culture. Further evaluation of NVP-AEW541, and other selective IGF-1R inhibitors, may play an important role in multimodal treatment of malignant mesothelioma.",Comparative Study,4890.0,18.0,Malignant is a devastating disease with a poor prognosis Recent data have shown that insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor IGF-1R may play a role in oncogenic signaling Our aim was to evaluate the effect of a novel IGF-1R inhibitor NVP-AEW541 on cell growth and IGF associated pathways Malignant cell lines H2373 and H2461 previously shown to activate the IGF pathway were grown in culture The adherent cells initially plated at 5 x 10 5 cells/plate were treated for 72 hours in triplicate with varying concentration of NVP-AEW541 0 1 5 10 20 and 50 microM Viable cells were counted every 24 hours Additionally separate cultures in serum-free medium were treated with NVP-AEW541 then stimulated with IGF and lysates collected for immunoblot analysis In both cell lines 0 1 5 and 10 microM showed an inhibitory or static effect while 20 and 50 microM were cidal Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that phosphorylation of IGF-1R was inhibited by NVP-AEW541 at higher concentration Phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt downstream IGF pathway mediators were also shown to be repressed by drug treatment NVP-AEW541 has a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on cells in culture NVP-AEW541 acts by inhibition of IGF-1R phosphorylation Inhibition effects phosphorylation of downstream mediators in a dose-dependent fashion Inhibition of the IGF pathway decreases viability of cell culture Further evaluation of NVP-AEW541 and other selective IGF-1R inhibitors may play an important role in multimodal treatment of malignant,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[393, 16, 8, 5778, 34, 5, 8, 334, 356, 435, 74, 47, 443, 17, 1601, 733, 129, 161, 14, 153, 1273, 2994, 68, 1343, 8, 200, 4, 1302, 314, 114, 1130, 10, 6, 376, 3, 254, 1, 8, 229, 1273, 2994, 230, 5678, 16878, 23, 31, 129, 2, 1273, 41, 460, 393, 31, 285, 30311, 2, 24507, 373, 443, 6, 2977, 3, 1273, 308, 11, 5473, 4, 2099, 3, 7010, 37, 1625, 17115, 28, 33, 1006, 79, 33, 37, 9656, 11, 73, 9, 720, 1459, 4, 17116, 5, 2990, 1227, 1, 5678, 16878, 13, 14, 33, 79, 179, 2, 212, 3550, 2663, 37, 11, 12252, 454, 259, 1459, 1724, 2282, 3231, 4, 524, 115, 3759, 11, 73, 5, 5678, 16878, 818, 2816, 5, 1273, 2, 8674, 786, 9, 7625, 65, 4, 110, 31, 285, 13, 14, 33, 2, 79, 3550, 224, 35, 1810, 15, 9708, 254, 369, 179, 2, 212, 3550, 11, 55705, 7625, 65, 264, 17, 982, 1, 1273, 2994, 10, 879, 20, 5678, 16878, 28, 142, 1227, 982, 1, 2625, 735, 178, 216, 2, 649, 1489, 1273, 308, 4425, 11, 120, 443, 6, 40, 6654, 20, 234, 24, 5678, 16878, 71, 8, 1227, 470, 1810, 254, 23, 37, 4, 2099, 5678, 16878, 4459, 20, 297, 1, 1273, 2994, 982, 297, 176, 982, 1, 1489, 4425, 4, 8, 61, 470, 3240, 297, 1, 3, 1273, 308, 2140, 2120, 1, 31, 2099, 195, 451, 1, 5678, 16878, 2, 127, 1094, 1273, 2994, 222, 68, 1343, 35, 305, 200, 4, 4122, 24, 1, 393]",1542.0,16928523,167
Positron emission tomography predicts survival in malignant pleural mesothelioma.,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg.,2006-10-01,"Recent studies suggest that standard uptake value on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan can predict mediastinal lymph node status in malignant pleural mesothelioma. Because mediastinal nodal metastasis is known to be associated with poor prognosis, we hypothesized that standard uptake value on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography might independently predict survival. Patients with pathologically proven mesothelioma underwent fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scanning. Patients fasted and received a minimum of 10 mCi of F18-fluorodeoxyglucose. Whole-body emission studies were acquired, followed by whole-body transmission scans with iterative reconstruction. On the basis of the maximal chi-square method, a standard uptake value of 10 was chosen to classify patients as low versus high standard uptake value. Survival probabilities for both standard uptake value groups were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox proportional hazards model assessed the joint influence of standard uptake value, histology, and stage on survival. From 1998 to 2005, 137 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma underwent positron emission tomography scans. The median follow-up for all surviving patients was 24 months. Median survivals were 9 and 21 months for the high and low standard uptake value groups, respectively (P = .02). In a multivariable analysis, high standard uptake value tumors were associated with a 1.9 times greater risk of death than low standard uptake value tumors (P < .01). Mixed histology carried a 2.9 times greater risk of death than epithelioid histology (P < .01), and stages III and IV had a 1.8 times greater risk of death than stages I and II (P = .05). Standard uptake value greater than 10, mixed histology, and stages III and IV are poor risk factors in malignant pleural mesothelioma.

Extrapleural pneumonectomy in children.,Journal of pediatric surgery,J. Pediatr. Surg.,2006-10-01,"Extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) is an en bloc resection of the pleura, lung, diaphragm, and pericardium. EPP in the pediatric population has not been reported in the literature. We report our experience of using EPP in children to treat a variety of malignancies that involve the pleural surface. We performed a retrospective review of all children treated through EPP at our institution. Data were obtained from patient charts and a pediatric database. All patients underwent en bloc resection of the pleura, lung, diaphragm, and pericardium and reconstruction. Four patients underwent EPP from 2000 to 2004 for inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, spindle cell sarcoma, metastatic neuroblastoma, and malignant mesothelioma. The patients' ages were from 6 to 11 years.

Intraoperative localization of lymph node metastases with a replication-competent herpes simplex virus.,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg.,2006-11-01,"Lymph node status is the most important prognostic factor determining recurrence and survival in patients with mesothelioma and other thoracic malignancies. Accurate localization of lymph node metastases is therefore necessary to improve selection of resectable and curable patients for surgical intervention. This study investigates the potential to identify lymph node metastases intraoperatively by using herpes-guided cancer cell-specific expression of green fluorescent protein. After infection with NV1066, a herpes simplex virus carrying green fluorescent protein transgene, human mesothelioma cancer cell lines were assessed for cancer cell-specific infection, green fluorescent protein expression, viral replication, and cytotoxicity. Murine models of lymphatic metastasis were established by means of surgical implantation of cancer cells into the preauricular (drainage to cervical lymph nodes) and pleural (mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes) spaces of athymic mice. Fluorescent thoracoscopy, laparoscopy, and stereomicroscopy were used to localize lymph node metastases that were confirmed by means of immunohistochemistry. In vitro NV1066 infected, replicated (5- to 17,000-fold), and expressed green fluorescent protein in all cancer cells, even when infected at a low ratio of one viral plaque-forming unit per 100 tumor cells. In vivo NV1066 injected into primary tumors was able to locate and infect lymph node metastases producing green fluorescent protein that was visualized by means of fluorescent imaging. Histology confirmed lymphatic metastases, and immunohistochemistry confirmed viral presence in regions that expressed green fluorescent protein. Herpes virus-guided cancer cell-specific production of green fluorescent protein can facilitate accurate localization of lymph node metastases. Fluorescent filters that detect green fluorescent protein can be incorporated into operative scopes to precisely localize and biopsy lymph node metastases.",Journal Article,4829.0,29.0,"Lymph node status is the most important prognostic factor determining recurrence and survival in patients with and other thoracic malignancies Accurate localization of lymph node metastases is therefore necessary to improve selection of resectable and curable patients for surgical intervention This study investigates the potential to identify lymph node metastases intraoperatively by using herpes-guided cancer cell-specific expression of green fluorescent protein After infection with NV1066 a herpes simplex virus carrying green fluorescent protein transgene human cancer cell lines were assessed for cancer cell-specific infection green fluorescent protein expression viral replication and cytotoxicity Murine models of lymphatic metastasis were established by means of surgical implantation of cancer cells into the preauricular drainage to lymph nodes and pleural mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes spaces of athymic mice Fluorescent thoracoscopy laparoscopy and stereomicroscopy were used to localize lymph node metastases that were confirmed by means of immunohistochemistry In vitro NV1066 infected replicated 5- to 17,000-fold and expressed green fluorescent protein in all cancer cells even when infected at a low ratio of one viral plaque-forming unit per 100 tumor cells In vivo NV1066 injected into primary tumors was able to locate and infect lymph node metastases producing green fluorescent protein that was visualized by means of fluorescent imaging Histology confirmed lymphatic metastases and immunohistochemistry confirmed viral presence in regions that expressed green fluorescent protein Herpes virus-guided cancer cell-specific production of green fluorescent protein can facilitate accurate localization of lymph node metastases Fluorescent filters that detect green fluorescent protein can be incorporated into operative scopes to precisely localize and biopsy lymph node metastases",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[263, 289, 156, 16, 3, 96, 305, 177, 161, 2196, 146, 2, 25, 4, 7, 5, 2, 127, 2098, 441, 1481, 2145, 1, 263, 289, 196, 16, 673, 1493, 6, 401, 881, 1, 1899, 2, 4151, 7, 9, 221, 788, 26, 45, 7259, 3, 174, 6, 255, 263, 289, 196, 6595, 20, 75, 4716, 1808, 12, 31, 112, 55, 1, 4658, 2910, 178, 50, 930, 5, 7748, 8, 4716, 7241, 1450, 2934, 4658, 2910, 178, 6632, 171, 12, 31, 285, 11, 275, 9, 12, 31, 112, 930, 4658, 2910, 178, 55, 1667, 2079, 2, 1408, 1471, 274, 1, 2936, 278, 11, 635, 20, 2263, 1, 221, 4314, 1, 12, 37, 237, 3, 34010, 3528, 6, 263, 502, 2, 2164, 2626, 2, 2591, 263, 502, 11757, 1, 6396, 399, 2910, 15153, 3553, 2, 55833, 11, 95, 6, 8031, 263, 289, 196, 17, 11, 557, 20, 2263, 1, 888, 4, 439, 7748, 3369, 6714, 33, 6, 269, 984, 1116, 2, 570, 4658, 2910, 178, 4, 62, 12, 37, 871, 198, 3369, 28, 8, 154, 197, 1, 104, 1667, 8506, 4525, 2712, 379, 394, 30, 37, 4, 386, 7748, 2651, 237, 86, 57, 10, 1665, 6, 15124, 2, 13510, 263, 289, 196, 3787, 4658, 2910, 178, 17, 10, 6326, 20, 2263, 1, 2910, 270, 784, 557, 2936, 196, 2, 888, 557, 1667, 463, 4, 1374, 17, 570, 4658, 2910, 178, 4716, 1450, 1808, 12, 31, 112, 1529, 1, 4658, 2910, 178, 122, 1876, 1481, 2145, 1, 263, 289, 196, 2910, 10788, 17, 1426, 4658, 2910, 178, 122, 40, 2449, 237, 1208, 55834, 6, 7428, 8031, 2, 411, 263, 289, 196]",1919.0,17059941,159

Radiation-induced cellular DNA damage repair response enhances viral gene therapy efficacy in the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2006-11-01,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) treated with radiotherapy (RT) has incomplete responses as a result of radiation-induced tumoral stress response that repairs DNA damage. Such stress response is beneficial for oncolytic viral therapy. We hypothesized that a combination of RT and NV1066, an oncolytic herpes virus, might exert an additive or synergistic effect in the treatment of MPM. JMN, a MPM cell line, was infected with NV1066 at multiplicities of infection of .05 to .25 in vitro with and without radiation (1 to 5 Gy). Virus replication was determined by plaque assay, cell kill by lactate dehydrogenase assay, and GADD34 (growth arrest and DNA damage repair 34, a DNA damage-repair protein) by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot test. Synergistic cytotoxicity dependence on GADD34 upregulation was confirmed by GADD34 small inhibitory RNA (siRNA). Synergism was demonstrated between RT and NV1066 across a wide range of doses. As a result of such synergism, a dose-reduction for each agent (up to 5500-fold) can be accomplished over a wide range of therapeutic-effect levels without sacrificing tumor cell kill. This effect is correlated with increased GADD34 expression and inhibited by transfection of siRNA directed against GADD34.

"Single-arm, open label study of pemetrexed plus cisplatin in chemotherapy naïve patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma: outcomes of an expanded access program.","Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",Lung Cancer,2006-11-07,"An expanded access program (EAP) provided patient access to pemetrexed prior to its commercial availability. The current report consists of US patients in the EAP who had chemotherapy naïve pleural mesothelioma. Eligible patients had a histologic or cytologic diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma that was not amenable to curative treatment with surgery. Study treatment consisted of pemetrexed 500mg/m(2) in combination with cisplatin 75mg/m(2) once every 21 days. Vitamin B12, folic acid, and dexamethasone were administered as prophylaxis. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported by investigators and compiled in a pharmacovigilance database for all patients enrolled in the EAP. Of 1056 patients receiving at least one dose of pemetrexed in the EAP, 728 had chemotherapy naïve pleural mesothelioma. Median age of this group was 70 years (range 23-89 years) and 84% were male. Among 615 patients, overall response rate was 20.5%, including 12 complete responses (2.0%) and 114 partial responses (18.5%). An additional 290 patients (47.2%) had stable disease. Median survival for all 728 patients was 10.8 months (95% CI=9.8, 12.3; 60.3% censorship) and 1 year survival was 45.4%.

We designed this clinical trial to test the feasibility of induction chemotherapy followed by EPP and RT in locally advanced MPM with the ultimate aim of improving survival. Patients with MPM and stage III or IV disease were eligible. Induction therapy was four cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin. Patients without disease progression by computed tomography underwent EPP followed by adjuvant hemithoracic RT (54 cGy). From January 2002 to January 2004, 21 patients (17 men, four women; median age 60 years) were entered into the study. Histology was epithelioid in 14 patients and mixed or sarcomatoid five patients. Pretreatment disease stage was III in 13 patients and IV in six patients. Nineteen patients received induction chemotherapy. Response to induction therapy was complete in zero patients, partial in five patients, stable disease in six patients, and progression of disease in eight patients. Eight of nine patients undergoing surgical exploration had EPP. The median survival of all patients was 19 months. Patients who had an EPP had a median survival of 33.5 months. Patients with unresectable tumors had a median survival of 9 months (p = 0.01).

However, there are limited data available on the efficacy of these and other chemotherapy regimens in patients who have received previous systemic chemotherapy. To gather additional efficacy and safety data of pemetrexed/cisplatin and pemetrexed alone in previously treated patients, we examined patients treated on the Eli Lilly and Company expanded access program (EAP). Patients with malignant mesothelioma were enrolled in this trial. Of 1056 patients receiving at least one dose of the study drug, 187 (17.7%) were previously treated patients with MPM. Patients were treated every 21 days with pemetrexed 500 mg/m alone (n = 91) or in combination with cisplatin 75 mg/m (n = 96) for a maximum of six cycles. All patients received folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation and steroid prophylaxis. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported by investigators and compiled in a pharmaco-vigilance database for all patients enrolled in the EAP. Median age of the previously treated pleural mesothelioma subset was 66 years (range, 27-87 years). Based on 153 evaluable patients (a subset of the larger intent-to-treat population of 187), the overall response rate was 32.5% for pemetrexed and cisplatin and 5.5% for pemetrexed alone. The disease control rate (response rate + stable disease) was 68.7% for pemetrexed and cisplatin and 46.6% for pemetrexed alone. Median survival was 7.6 months for pemetrexed plus cisplatin (67% censored) and 4.1 months for pemetrexed alone (55% censored). The most commonly reported serious adverse events in the overall EAP irrespective of causality were dehydration (7.2%), nausea (5.2%), vomiting (4.9%), dyspnea (3.8%), and pulmonary embolism (2.4%).

Of the 63 patients, 23 (37%) had died within 6 months of IMRT (10 of recurrent cancer, 6 of pulmonary causes [pneumonia in 4 and pneumonitis in 2], and 7 of other noncancer causes [pulmonary embolus in 2, sepsis after bronchopleural fistula in 1, and cause unknown but without pulmonary symptoms or recurrent disease in 4]). On univariate analysis, the factors that predicted for PRD were a lower preoperative ejection fraction (p = 0.021), absolute volume of lung spared at 10 Gy (p = 0.025), percentage of lung volume receiving >or=20 Gy (V(20); p = 0.002), and mean lung dose (p = 0.013). On multivariate analysis, only V20 was predictive of PRD (p = 0.017; odds ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.08) or non-cancer-related death (p = 0.033; odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.45). The results of our study have shown that fatal pulmonary toxicities were associated with radiation to the contralateral lung. V20 was the only independent determinant for risk of PRD or non-cancer-related death.

Bortezomib is an FDA-approved proteasome inhibitor that is currently under clinical investigation in multiple neoplasms but has not been studied extensively in MPM.

We used four MPM cell lines (MS589, H28, H2052, JMN), a normal mesothelial cell line (HM3), and a lung cancer cell line (H23) in survival studies utilizing bortezomib, cisplatin, and pemetrexed alone and in combination by administering concurrently or by varying the order of administration. We determined the effect of bortezomib on the cell cycle, apoptosis, and on the expression of cell cycle proteins p21/WAF1 and p27/KIP1 and on apoptosis-related proteins IAP-1, IAP-2, survivin, and XIAP. Bortezomib was highly cytotoxic to MPM cells and induced both G(2)/M and G(1)/S cell cycle arrest. Apoptosis increased in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in 3 of 4 MPM cell lines. Bortezomib stabilized or increased protein levels of p21/WAF1 and IAP-1 and to a lesser degree p27/KIP1, IAP-2, XIAP, and survivin. In combination studies with cisplatin, bortezomib was generally synergistic at high concentrations and antagonistic at low concentrations. Bortezomib increased the cytotoxicity of cisplatin and pemetrexed in a concentration-dependent manner when administered prior to either.

"Inhibition of c-Src expression and activation in malignant pleural mesothelioma tissues leads to apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and decreased migration and invasion.",Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2007-07-01,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a deadly disease with few systemic treatment options. One potential therapeutic target, the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src, causes changes in proliferation, motility, invasion, survival, and angiogenesis in cancer cells and may be a valid therapeutic target in MPM. To test this hypothesis, we determined the effects of c-Src inhibition in MPM cell lines and examined c-Src expression and activation in tissue samples. We analyzed four MPM cell lines and found that all expressed total and activated c-Src. Three of the four cell lines were sensitive by in vitro cytotoxicity assays to the c-Src inhibitor dasatinib, which led to cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis. Dasatinib also inhibited migration and invasion independent of the cytotoxic effects, and led to the rapid and durable inhibition of c-Src and its downstream pathways. We used immunohistochemical analysis to determine the levels of c-Src expression and activation in 46 archived MPM tumor specimens. The Src protein was highly expressed in tumor cells, but expression did not correlate with survival. However, expression of activated Src (p-Src Y419) on the tumor cell membrane was higher in patients with advanced-stage disease; the presence of metastasis correlated with higher membrane (P = 0.03) and cytoplasmic (P = 0.04) expression of p-Src Y419. Lower levels of membrane expression of inactive c-Src (p-Src Y530) correlated with advanced N stage (P = 0.02).

Peptide epitopes from the Wilms' tumor 1 oncoprotein stimulate CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that recognize and kill human malignant mesothelioma tumor cells.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2007-08-01,"Wilms' tumor 1 protein (WT1), a transcription factor overexpressed in malignant mesothelioma, leukemias, and other solid tumors, is an ideal target for immunotherapy. WT1 class I peptide epitopes that were identified and shown to stimulate CD8(+) T cells are being tested as vaccine candidates in several clinical trials. The induction and maintenance of a robust memory CD8(+) cytotoxic T-cell response requires CD4(+) T-cell help. Three HLA class II peptide epitopes of WT1 with high predictive affinities to multiple HLA-DRB1 molecules were identified using the SYFPEITHI algorithm. Due to the highly polymorphic nature of the HLA class II alleles, such reactivity is critical in the development of a broadly useful therapeutic. One of the WT1 CD4(+) peptide epitopes, 122-140, comprises a previously identified CD8(+) peptide epitope (126-134). By mutating residue 126 from an arginine to a tyrosine, we embedded a synthetic immunogenic analogue CD8(+) epitope (126-134) inside the longer peptide (122-140). This analogue was previously designed to improve immunogenicity and induce a potent CD8(+) response. WT1 peptides 328-349 and 423-441 are able to stimulate a peptide-specific CD4(+) response that can recognize WT1(+) tumor cells in multiple HLA-DRB1 settings as determined by IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assays.

Influence of radiotherapy technique and dose on patterns of failure for mesothelioma patients after extrapleural pneumonectomy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2007-08-01,"Extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) is an effective treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma. We compared the outcomes after moderate-dose hemithoracic radiotherapy (MDRT) and high-dose hemithoracic RT (HDRT) after EPP for malignant pleural mesothelioma. Between July 1994 and April 2004, 39 patients underwent EPP and adjuvant RT at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Brigham and Women's Hospital. Between 1994 and 2002, MDRT, including 30 Gy to the hemithorax, 40 Gy to the mediastinum, and boosts to positive margins or nodes to 54 Gy, was given, generally with concurrent chemotherapy. In 2003, HDRT to 54 Gy with a matched photon/electron technique was given, with sequential chemotherapy. A total of 39 patients underwent RT after EPP. The median age was 59 years (range, 44-77). The histologic type was epithelial in 25 patients (64%) and mixed or sarcomatoid in 14 patients (36%). Of the 39 patients, 24 underwent MDRT and 15 (39%) HDRT. The median follow-up was 23 months (range, 6-71). The median overall survival was 19 months (95% confidence interval, 14-24). The median time to distant failure (DF) and local failure (LF) was 20 months (95% confidence interval, 14-26) and 26 months (95% confidence interval, 16-36), respectively. On univariate and multivariate analyses, only a mixed histologic type was predictive of inferior DF (p <0.006) and overall survival (p <0.004). The RT technique was not predictive of LF, DF, or overall survival. The LF rate was 50% (12 of 24) after MDRT and 27% (4 of 15) after HDRT (p = NS). Four patients who had undergone HDRT were alive and without evidence of disease at the last follow-up. High-dose hemithoracic RT appears to limit in-field LF compared with MDRT.

Extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) followed by hemithoracic irradiation has shown promise, but local failure remains a significant problem. To improve local control, we have used intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) as it allows better dose distribution to regions at risk of recurrence as well as reduced radiation to surrounding organs. One hundred consecutive patients underwent EPP. At a median interval of 2.5 months from surgery, 63 patients received IMRT (median dose 45 Gy) with curative intent. Chemotherapy was not routinely administered. Tumors were right sided in 66 patients (66%) and nonepithelioid in 33 (33%). American Joint Committee on Cancer pathology stage was I in 6 patients (6%), II in 7 (7%), III in 72 (72%), and IV (T4) in 15 (15%). Fifty-four patients (54%) had ipsilateral nodal metastases. Perioperative mortality was 8%. Median overall survival (n = 100) was 10.2 months. For patients who received IMRT (n = 63), median overall and 3-year survival was 14.2 months and 20%. Of these, node-negative patients with epithelioid histology (n = 18) had median and 3-year survival of 28 months and 41%. Distant recurrences occurred in 33 of 61 evaluable patients (54%). Eight patients (13%) had local or regional recurrence, 5 of whom also recurred distally. Only 3 patients (5%) had recurrence within the irradiated field.

We have recently developed MORAb-009, a mouse-human chimeric IgG1kappa monoclonal antibody with an affinity of 1.5 nM for human mesothelin. Here we provide evidence that MORAb-009 prevents adhesion of mesothelin-bearing tumor cells to MUC16 positive cells and can elicit cell-mediated cytotoxicity on mesothelin-bearing tumor cells. Treatment that included MORAb-009 in combination with chemotherapy led to a marked reduction in tumor growth of mesothelin-expressing tumors in nude mice compared to chemotherapy or MORAb-009 treatment alone. No adverse effects of MORAb-009 were noted during toxicology studies conducted in non-human primates. The preclinical data obtained from our studies warrants pursuing clinical testing of MORAb-009. We have in fact initiated a Phase I clinical study enrolling patients with mesothelin-positive pancreatic, mesothelioma, non-small cell lung and ovarian cancers.",Journal Article,4416.0,106.0,Novel therapeutic agents that are safe and effective are needed for the treatment of adenocarcinomas and mesotheliomas Mesothelin is a glycosyl-phosphatidyl inositol GPI -linked membrane protein of 40 kDa over-expressed in all adenocarcinoma and in 70 of adenocarcinoma and in cell and cancers The biological functions of mesothelin are not known although it appears to be involved in cell adhesion via its interaction with MUC16 We have recently developed MORAb-009 a mouse-human chimeric IgG1kappa monoclonal antibody with an affinity of 1.5 nM for human mesothelin Here we provide evidence that MORAb-009 prevents adhesion of mesothelin-bearing tumor cells to MUC16 positive cells and can elicit cell-mediated cytotoxicity on mesothelin-bearing tumor cells Treatment that included MORAb-009 in combination with chemotherapy led to a marked reduction in tumor growth of mesothelin-expressing tumors in nude mice compared to chemotherapy or MORAb-009 treatment alone No adverse effects of MORAb-009 were noted during toxicology studies conducted in non-human primates The preclinical data obtained from our studies warrants pursuing clinical testing of MORAb-009 We have in fact initiated a Phase I clinical study enrolling patients with mesothelin-positive cell and cancers,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[229, 189, 183, 17, 32, 1165, 2, 323, 32, 575, 9, 3, 24, 1, 1586, 2, 11789, 5402, 16, 8, 56775, 15628, 13816, 10344, 1199, 1905, 178, 1, 327, 6362, 252, 570, 4, 62, 449, 2, 4, 431, 1, 449, 2, 4, 31, 2, 163, 3, 1037, 1681, 1, 5402, 32, 44, 440, 242, 192, 1233, 6, 40, 646, 4, 31, 2128, 847, 211, 915, 5, 8072, 21, 47, 761, 276, 12029, 2376, 8, 830, 171, 2897, 44984, 848, 548, 5, 35, 3601, 1, 14, 33, 2878, 9, 171, 5402, 467, 21, 377, 241, 17, 12029, 2376, 5217, 2128, 1, 5402, 1894, 30, 37, 6, 8072, 109, 37, 2, 122, 5487, 31, 517, 1408, 23, 5402, 1894, 30, 37, 24, 17, 159, 12029, 2376, 4, 150, 5, 56, 836, 6, 8, 2003, 628, 4, 30, 129, 1, 5402, 1046, 57, 4, 2598, 399, 72, 6, 56, 15, 12029, 2376, 24, 279, 77, 290, 176, 1, 12029, 2376, 11, 1051, 190, 18174, 94, 426, 4, 220, 171, 17763, 3, 693, 74, 683, 29, 114, 94, 2782, 10692, 38, 471, 1, 12029, 2376, 21, 47, 4, 1991, 1917, 8, 124, 70, 38, 45, 6280, 7, 5, 5402, 109, 31, 2, 163]",1275.0,18088084,14

Extrapleural pneumonectomy versus pleurectomy/decortication in the surgical management of malignant pleural mesothelioma: results in 663 patients.,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg.,2008-02-14,"The optimal procedure for resection of malignant pleural mesothelioma is controversial, partly because previous analyses include small numbers of patients. We performed a multi-institutional study to increase statistical power to detect significant differences in outcome between extrapleural pneumonectomy and pleurectomy/decortication. Patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma who underwent extrapleural pneumonectomy or pleurectomy/decortication at 3 institutions were identified. Survival and prognostic factors were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards analysis. From 1990 to 2006, 663 consecutive patients (538 men and 125 women) underwent resection. The median age was 63 years (range, 26-93 years). The operative mortality was 7% for extrapleural pneumonectomy (n = 27/385) and 4% for pleurectomy/decortication (n = 13/278). Significant survival differences were seen for American Joint Committee on Cancer stages 1 to 4 (P < .001), epithelioid versus non-epithelioid histology (P < .001), extrapleural pneumonectomy versus pleurectomy/decortication (P < .001), multimodality therapy versus surgery alone (P < .001), and gender (P < .001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated a hazard rate of 1.4 for extrapleural pneumonectomy (P < .001) controlling for stage, histology, gender, and multimodality therapy. Patients who underwent pleurectomy/decortication had a better survival than those who underwent extrapleural pneumonectomy; however, the reasons are multifactorial and subject to selection bias.

The combination of pemetrexed/gemcitabine has not previously been studied in MPM to our knowledge. Patients with histologic or cytologic diagnosis of MPM were included. Cohort 1 received gemcitabine 1,250 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8, with pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) on day 8, and cohort 2 received gemcitabine 1,250 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8, with pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) on day 1. Cycles were repeated every 21 days; all patients were supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B(12) and received dexamethasone. One hundred eight patients (cohort 1, n = 56; cohort 2, n = 52) with pleural mesothelioma were enrolled. Among assessable patients, response rate was 26.0% in cohort 1 and 17.1% in cohort 2. Median time to disease progression was 4.34 months for cohort 1 and 7.43 months for cohort 2. Median survival was 8.08 months for cohort 1 (1-year survival = 31.14%) and 10.12 months for cohort 2 (1-year survival = 45.80%).

Response to the methylation inhibitor dihydro-5-azacytidine in mesothelioma is not associated with methylation of p16INK4a: results of cancer and leukemia group B 159904.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2008-04-01,"The molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis in mesothelioma involve the loss of negative regulators of cell growth including p16INK4a. Absence of expression of the p16INK4a gene product is exhibited in virtually all mesothelioma tumors and cell lines examined to date. Loss of p16INK4a expression has also been frequently observed in more common neoplasms such as lung cancer as well. In a wide variety of these malignancies, including lung cancer, p16INK4a expression is known to be inactivated by hypermethylation of the first exon. This project (CALGB 159904) intended to test the hypothesis that in mesothelioma loss of p16INK4a via methylation would correlate with response to the cytidine analog and methylation inhibitor dihydro-5-azacytidine (DHAC). Using tissue samples from CALGB 8833 and 9031, two clinical studies which used DHAC based therapy in mesothelioma, this study tested the hypothesis that tumors possessing methylation of p16INK4a would have a better response and survival following DHAC treatment than their nonmethylated counterparts. Methylation of p16INK4a was identified in 4 of the 20 specimens. Although there was a trend towards improved survival the result was not statistically significant.

Erlotinib plus bevacizumab in previously treated patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.,Cancer,Cancer,2008-08-01,"We conducted a phase 2, multicenter, open-label study of erlotinib plus bevacizumab in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma who had previously received 1 prior chemotherapy regimen. These agents have activity in non-small cell lung cancer, but their role in mesothelioma is unclear. The primary endpoint is response rate. Secondary endpoints include time to progression, survival, and toxicity. Eligible patients with mesothelioma who had previously received 1 chemotherapy regimen were treated with erlotinib 150 mg per os daily and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg administered intravenously on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle. Treatment continued until disease progression or development of significant toxicity. Tumor response was assessed after every 2 cycles using previously established mesothelioma response criteria from Byrne and Nowak. Twenty-four eligible patients initiated therapy with erlotinib and bevacizumab between February 2004 and October 2006. There were no complete or partial responses, although 12 patients achieved stable disease for at least 2 cycles of treatment. The median time to progression was 2.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 months-5.9 months). The median survival was 5.8 months (95% CI, 2.8 months-10.1 months). The most common toxicities were rash and diarrhea. There were no treatment-related deaths, intracranial bleeding, or hemoptysis. The combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab was tolerated reasonably well, but there was no evidence of radiographic response. This study demonstrates the feasibility of conducting trials in mesothelioma patients who have failed first-line therapy.

Pemetrexed plus gemcitabine as first-line chemotherapy for patients with peritoneal mesothelioma: final report of a phase II trial.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2008-07-01,"Pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin is approved for the treatment of pleural mesothelioma and is active in malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPeM). Pemetrexed and gemcitabine are synergistic in preclinical models, but the activity of this combination in MPeM is unknown. This clinical study assessed safety and efficacy of pemetrexed plus gemcitabine in chemotherapy-naïve patients with MPeM. Treatment consisted of gemcitabine 1,250 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8, and pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) on day 8, administered immediately before gemcitabine. Treatment was repeated every 21 days for six cycles or until disease progression. All patients received folic acid, vitamin B(12), and dexamethasone supplementation. End points included tumor response, toxicity, time to disease progression (TTPD), and overall survival (OS). Disease control rate (DCR) was also calculated. Twenty patients were enrolled between December 2002 and May 2004. The confirmed response rate was 15% (95% CI, 3.2% to 37.9%), with three patients experiencing a partial response. The DCR was 50% (95% CI, 27.2% to 72.8%). The most common grade 3 to 4 nonhematologic toxicities included fatigue (20%), constipation (10%), vomiting (10%), and dehydration (10%). Hematologic toxicities included grade 3 to 4 neutropenia (60%) and febrile neutropenia (10%). One patient death was attributed to treatment. Median TTPD and OS times were 10.4 months and 26.8 months, respectively. The combination of pemetrexed plus gemcitabine was active in patients with MPeM with a notably high incidence of neutropenia.

MET as a target for treatment of chest tumors.,"Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",Lung Cancer,2008-07-30,"The receptor tyrosine kinase MET has been studied of a large variety of human cancers, including lung and mesothelioma. The MET receptor and its ligand HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) play important roles in cell growth, survival and migration, and dysregulation of the HGF-MET pathway leads to oncogenic changes including tumor proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis. In small cell lung cancer (SCLC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), MET is dysregulated via overexpression, constitutive activation, gene amplification, ligand-dependent activation, mutation or epigenetic mechanisms.

Novel oncolytic agent GLV-1h68 is effective against malignant pleural mesothelioma.,Human gene therapy,Hum. Gene Ther.,2008-08-01,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a fatal disease with a median survival of less than 14 months. For the first time, a genetically engineered vaccinia virus is shown to produce efficient infection, replication, and oncolytic effect against MPM. GLV-1h68 is a replication-competent engineered vaccinia virus carrying transgenes encoding Renilla luciferase, green fluorescent protein (both inserted at the F14.5L locus), beta-galactosidase (inserted at the J2R locus, which encodes thymidine kinase), and beta-glucuronidase (at the A56R locus, which encodes hemagglutinin). This virus was tested in six human MPM cell lines (MSTO-211H, VAMT, JMN, H-2373, H-2452, and H-2052). GLV-1h68 successfully infected all cell lines. For the most sensitive line, MSTO-211H, expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) started within 4 hr with increasing intensity over time until nearly 100% of cells expressed GFP at 24 hr. All cell lines were sensitive to killing by GLV-1h68, with the degree of sensitivity predictable by infectivity assay. Even the most resistant cell line exhibited 44 +/- 3.8% cell survival by day 7 when infected at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0. Viral proliferation assays demonstrated 2-to 4-fold logarithmic replication of GLV-1h68 in the cell lines tested. In an orthotopic model, GLV-1h68 effectively prevented development of cachexia and tumor-related morbidity, reduced tumor burden, and cured MPM in both early and late treatment groups. GLV-1h68 was successfully used to treat MPM in vitro and in an orthotopic model (in vivo).

Protein kinase C beta in malignant pleural mesothelioma.,Anti-cancer drugs,Anticancer Drugs,2008-10-01,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a disease with few therapeutic options. Protein kinase C beta (PKCbeta) is involved in important cellular functions. Enzastaurin (LY317615.HCl) is a novel inhibitor of PKC in clinical development. MPM cell lines (7) and patient tumor tissues (24) were evaluated for expression of PKCbeta by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. In-vitro cell growth assays were performed with enzastaurin with or without cisplatin. Cell migration was evaluated with the wound healing assay. Downstream signaling (survival and focal adhesion pathways) was studied by immunoblotting for related molecules in the presence of phorbol ester with or without enzastaurin. Expression for PKCbeta1 was seen in all cases, with a mean integrated optical density of 152.5 (standard deviation=95.47, n=24), whereas PKCbeta2 expression was less intense, with a mean integrated optical density of 11.45 (standard deviation=16.27, n=21). There was a trend toward lower overall survival among patients expressing above-median PKCbeta1 (P=0.064), but not PKCbeta2. Robust expression of PKCbeta1 and low expression of PKCbeta2 were observed in MPM cell lines. Treatment of MPM cell lines with enzastaurin revealed an IC50 of 5 micromol/l, and strong synergism was observed when combined with cisplatin. Wound healing assay revealed that treatment of H2461 cells with enzastaurin reduced migration by 59.2%. Enzastaurin treatment led to disruption of F-actin architecture. Downstream signaling showed reduced phosphorylation of AKT, FAK (focal adhesion kinase), p130Cas, S6 ribosomal protein, and paxillin. PKCbeta1 was expressed in the majority of MPM samples. Enzastaurin has preclinical activity against MPM, and exhibited synergism with cisplatin.

The impact of lymph node station on survival in 348 patients with surgically resected malignant pleural mesothelioma: implications for revision of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system.,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg.,2008-06-27,"The propensity of malignant pleural mesothelioma to metastasize to N1 or N2 nodes and their corresponding prognostic value is unclear. The American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system groups N1 and N2 disease together as stage III. The goal of this study was to define the prognostic value of specific nodal stations. Patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma who underwent resection were identified from an institutional database. Nodal stations were defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer lung cancer node map classification. Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards analysis. From 1990 to 2006, 348 patients were identified: 279 men and 69 women with a median age of 67 years (range 26-85 years). Extrapleural pneumonectomy was performed in 223 cases, and pleurectomy/decortication was performed in 125 cases. Survival differences (P < .01) were observed between 2 groups: N0 or N1(+) (median survival = 19 months) and N2(+), N2/N1(+) and internal thoracic(+) (median survival = 10 months). Survival was influenced by the number of involved N2 stations (0, 1, 2, or more: P < .001). Multivariate analysis grouping all N2 and internal thoracic(+) versus N1(+) and N0 demonstrated a hazard ratio for survival of 1.7 (P < .0001) controlling for T3/T4 status (hazard ratio = 1.3, P < .01), non-epithelioid histology (hazard ratio = 1.7, P < .0001), extrapleural pneumonectomy (1.1, P = .4), and male gender (hazard ratio 1.4, P < .01).

PAX5 is expressed in small-cell lung cancer and positively regulates c-Met transcription.,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,Lab. Invest.,2009-01-12,"PAX5 is a nuclear transcription factor required for B cell development, and its expression was evaluated in upper aerodigestive malignancies and pancreatic cancer by immunoblotting. The PAX5 protein expression was relatively strong in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC, 11/12); however, its expression was not detected in non-SCLC (NSCLC, n=13), mesothelioma (n=7), pancreatic (n=6), esophageal (n=6) and head and neck cancer cell lines (n=12). In comparison, PAX8 and PAX3 expressions were absent or non-detectable in SCLC cell lines; however, PAX8 was expressed in most of the tested NSCLC cell lines (13/13) and also frequently in all the other cell lines. We also detected frequent expressions of PAX2 and PAX9 protein in the various cell lines. Utilizing neuroendocrine tumor samples, we found that the frequency as well as the average intensity of the expression of PAX5 increased from pulmonary carcinoid (9%, moderate and strong PAX5 expression, n=44), to large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNC, 27%, n=11) to SCLC (33%, n=76). FISH analysis revealed no translocations of the PAX5 gene, but polyploidy in some SCLC tumor tissues (6/37). We determined that PAX5 could regulate the transcription of c-Met using luciferase-coupled reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. In addition, the phospho-c-Met (active form) and PAX5 were both localized to the same intra-nuclear compartment in hepatocyte growth factor treated SCLC cells and interacted with each other. Finally, we determined the therapeutic translational potential of PAX5 using PAX5 knockdown SCLC cells in conjunction with Topoisomerase 1 (SN38) and c-Met (SU11274) inhibitors. Loss of endogenous PAX5 significantly decreased the viability of SCLC cells, especially when combined with SN38 or SU11274, and maximum effect was seen when both inhibitors were used. Therefore, we propose that PAX5 could be an important regulator of c-Met transcription and a potential target for therapy in SCLC.",Journal Article,4026.0,67.0,PAX5 is a nuclear transcription factor required for B cell development and its expression was evaluated in upper aerodigestive malignancies and cancer by immunoblotting The PAX5 protein expression was relatively strong in small-cell cancer SCLC 11/12 however its expression was not detected in non-SCLC NSCLC n=13 n=7 n=6 n=6 and head and cancer cell lines n=12 In comparison PAX8 and PAX3 expressions were absent or non-detectable in SCLC cell lines however PAX8 was expressed in most of the tested NSCLC cell lines 13/13 and also frequently in all the other cell lines We also detected frequent expressions of PAX2 and PAX9 protein in the various cell lines Utilizing neuroendocrine tumor samples we found that the frequency as well as the average intensity of the expression of PAX5 increased from pulmonary 9 moderate and strong PAX5 expression n=44 to large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma LCNC 27 n=11 to SCLC 33 n=76 FISH analysis revealed no translocations of the PAX5 gene but polyploidy in some SCLC tumor tissues 6/37 We determined that PAX5 could regulate the transcription of c-Met using luciferase-coupled reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis In addition the phospho-c-Met active form and PAX5 were both localized to the same intra-nuclear compartment in growth factor treated SCLC cells and interacted with each other Finally we determined the therapeutic translational potential of PAX5 using PAX5 knockdown SCLC cells in conjunction with Topoisomerase 1 SN38 and c-Met SU11274 inhibitors Loss of endogenous PAX5 significantly decreased the viability of SCLC cells especially when combined with SN38 or SU11274 and maximum effect was seen when both inhibitors were used Therefore we propose that PAX5 could be an important regulator of c-Met transcription and a potential target for therapy in SCLC,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[6279, 16, 8, 928, 866, 161, 616, 9, 132, 31, 193, 2, 211, 55, 10, 194, 4, 1726, 11006, 441, 2, 12, 20, 5293, 3, 6279, 178, 55, 10, 1352, 1082, 4, 302, 31, 12, 1334, 175, 133, 137, 211, 55, 10, 44, 530, 4, 220, 1334, 304, 78, 233, 78, 67, 78, 49, 78, 49, 2, 718, 2, 12, 31, 285, 78, 133, 4, 1155, 8958, 2, 8424, 4249, 11, 3269, 15, 220, 2083, 4, 1334, 31, 285, 137, 8958, 10, 570, 4, 96, 1, 3, 650, 304, 31, 285, 233, 233, 2, 120, 746, 4, 62, 3, 127, 31, 285, 21, 120, 530, 908, 4249, 1, 15730, 2, 45395, 178, 4, 3, 747, 31, 285, 2600, 1542, 30, 347, 21, 204, 17, 3, 675, 22, 149, 22, 3, 1011, 837, 1, 3, 55, 1, 6279, 101, 29, 1087, 83, 1163, 2, 1082, 6279, 55, 78, 584, 6, 375, 31, 1542, 134, 45396, 428, 78, 175, 6, 1334, 466, 78, 846, 1277, 65, 553, 77, 3262, 1, 3, 6279, 145, 84, 24874, 4, 476, 1334, 30, 742, 49, 567, 21, 509, 17, 6279, 359, 2288, 3, 866, 1, 256, 543, 75, 3864, 3332, 3674, 2, 2287, 4857, 65, 4, 352, 3, 3125, 256, 543, 544, 1297, 2, 6279, 11, 110, 909, 6, 3, 827, 2392, 928, 3616, 4, 129, 161, 73, 1334, 37, 2, 7940, 5, 296, 127, 1368, 21, 509, 3, 189, 2460, 174, 1, 6279, 75, 6279, 1563, 1334, 37, 4, 3357, 5, 3999, 14, 10557, 2, 256, 543, 11496, 222, 407, 1, 2682, 6279, 97, 340, 3, 2120, 1, 1334, 37, 1093, 198, 397, 5, 10557, 15, 11496, 2, 689, 254, 10, 527, 198, 110, 222, 11, 95, 673, 21, 2548, 17, 6279, 359, 40, 35, 305, 2452, 1, 256, 543, 866, 2, 8, 174, 283, 9, 36, 4, 1334]",1827.0,19139719,214

Patients with mesothelioma were prospectively enrolled. Those with resectable disease received amifostine and 1-hour hyperthermic cisplatin perfusion of ipsilateral hemithorax and abdomen. Morbidity, recurrence, and survival were recorded. Forty-two patients were enrolled; 29 underwent resection (operative mortality 7%, 2/29). Median age was 57 years. Eighteen were in pathologic stage I or II; 11 were in stage III. Median hospitalization was 15 days. Common complications were atrial fibrillation (66%, 19 patients), deep venous thrombosis (31%, 9 patients), and grade 3+ renal toxicity (31%, 9 patients). Feasibility was determined. Renal toxicity was unrelated to cisplatin dose, with no maximum tolerated dose determined. Overall median survival was 17 months (resected 20 months, unresected 10 months). Median survivals were 26 months for patients receiving higher cisplatin doses and 16 months for those receiving lower doses (P = .35). Survival was significantly longer with negative extrapleural nodes (31 vs 14 months, P = .0115) and early stage (all resected 35 months for stage I-II vs 14 months for stage III, P = .0022, epithelial 39 months for stage I-II vs 15 months for stage III, P = .0072).

Patterns of local and nodal failure in malignant pleural mesothelioma after extrapleural pneumonectomy and photon-electron radiotherapy.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2009-06-01,"Multimodality therapy including extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP), chemotherapy, and radiotherapy (RT) is often recommended for fit patients with early stage malignant pleural mesothelioma. Planning RT after an EPP is difficult due to the large target area, the high doses required to prevent recurrence, and the proximity of critical structures. We studied patterns of local and nodal recurrence in patients treated at our institution with EPP and RT, and whether advanced treatment planning techniques, such as intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), could have been of potential benefit. From 1993 to 2008, 86 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma underwent EPP followed by hemithoracic RT (median dose: 54 Gy). The RT technique included a combination of photons and electrons to maximize dose to the target, whereas minimizing dose to normal tissues. After treatment, patients were followed with serial imaging and patterns of local and nodal failure were studied. Median follow-up time for 78 analyzed patients was 17 months. Eight percent were in stage I, 35% stage II, 55% stage III, and 2% stage IV. Ten percent of all patients developed late grade 3 pulmonary toxicity and no patient died of RT. Fifteen patients failed in local and/or nodal sites and did not have a distant component to their failure pattern. Of these 15 patients, 10 failed in regions of dose inhomogeneity and could have possibly benefited from IMRT. The photon-electron technique was tolerable, but IMRT may provide better target coverage in some patients.

Extrapleural pneumonectomy followed by intracavitary intraoperative hyperthermic cisplatin with pharmacologic cytoprotection for treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma: a phase II prospective study.,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg.,2009-08-01,"We sought to prospectively determine the feasibility and safety of hyperthermic intraoperative intracavitary cisplatin perfusion immediately after extrapleural pneumonectomy in the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma. Patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma who were surgical candidates underwent extrapleural pneumonectomy followed by hyperthermic intraoperative intracavitary cisplatin perfusion, consisting of a 1-hour lavage of the chest and abdomen with cisplatin (42 degrees C) at 225 mg/m(2). Pharmacologic cytoprotection consisted of intravenous sodium thiosulfate with or without amifostine. Morbidity and mortality were recorded prospectively. Ninety-six (79%) of 121 enrolled patients underwent extrapleural pneumonectomy, of whom 92 (76%) received hyperthermic intraoperative intracavitary cisplatin perfusion after extrapleural pneumonectomy. Fifty-three (58%) patients had epithelial tumors, and 39 (42%) had nonepithelial histology. Hospital mortality was 4.3%. Morbidity (grade 3 or 4, 49%) included atrial fibrillation in 22 (23.9%) patients, venous thrombosis in 12 (13%) patients, and laryngeal nerve dysfunction in 10 (11%) patients. Nine patients had renal toxicity, which was attributable to cisplatin in 8 of them. Among the 27 patients who also received amifostine (910 mg/m(2)), 1 patient had grade 3 renal toxicity attributable to cisplatin. Recurrence of malignant pleural mesothelioma was documented in 47 (51%) patients, with ipsilateral recurrence in 17.4% of patients. The median survival of the 121 enrolled patients was 12.8 months.

Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration for staging of malignant pleural mesothelioma.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2009-09-01,"Radical surgery for malignant pleural mesothelioma does not improve survival in patients with nodal metastases. Imaging is poor at predicting nodal involvement and mediastinoscopy, though frequently used, is of low sensitivity. As endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and esophageal endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are accurate for nodal staging of lung cancer, we hypothesized that they would be at least as sensitive as cervical video-mediastinoscopy for nodal staging of mesothelioma. Eighty-five patients with mesothelioma who were potential candidates for radical surgery underwent preoperative staging with mediastinoscopy (n = 50) or EBUS (n = 38). Eleven patients also underwent EUS. Diagnostic yield (specimens containing lymphocytes or tumor cells) was 100% for mediastinoscopy and 84% for EBUS (p < 0.001). Mediastinoscopy identified 7 of 50 (14%) patients with nodal metastases. Thirty-eight (76%) mediastinoscopy-negative patients underwent surgery with nodal sampling and there were 18 false negatives. Endobronchial ultrasound identified 13 of 38 (34%) patients with nodal metastases. Twenty-two (58%) EBUS-negative patients underwent surgery with nodal sampling and there were 10 false negatives. Sensitivity and negative predictive value for mediastinoscopy were 28% and 49%, and 59% and 57% for EBUS. Eleven patients had EUS preoperatively, which revealed infradiaphragmatic nodal metastases in 5 patients. Although this study is retrospective, EBUS had higher sensitivity than either mediastinoscopy or imaging studies for detection of nodal metastases. Nevertheless, the ability to accurately identify nodal involvement preoperatively in patients with mesothelioma remains suboptimal. Esophageal ultrasound may complement EBUS particularly in cases where infradiaphragmatic nodal metastases are suspected.",Comparative Study,3794.0,44.0,Radical surgery for malignant pleural does not improve survival in patients with nodal metastases Imaging is poor at predicting nodal involvement and mediastinoscopy though frequently used is of low sensitivity As endobronchial ultrasound EBUS and endoscopic ultrasound EUS are accurate for nodal staging of cancer we hypothesized that they would be at least as sensitive as video-mediastinoscopy for nodal staging of Eighty-five patients with who were potential candidates for radical surgery underwent preoperative staging with mediastinoscopy n 50 or EBUS n 38 Eleven patients also underwent EUS Diagnostic yield specimens containing lymphocytes or tumor cells was 100 for mediastinoscopy and 84 for EBUS p 0.001 Mediastinoscopy identified 7 of 50 14 patients with nodal metastases Thirty-eight 76 mediastinoscopy-negative patients underwent surgery with nodal sampling and there were 18 false negatives Endobronchial ultrasound identified 13 of 38 34 patients with nodal metastases Twenty-two 58 EBUS-negative patients underwent surgery with nodal sampling and there were 10 false negatives Sensitivity and negative predictive value for mediastinoscopy were 28 and 49 and 59 and 57 for EBUS Eleven patients had EUS preoperatively which revealed infradiaphragmatic nodal metastases in 5 patients Although this study is retrospective EBUS had higher sensitivity than either mediastinoscopy or imaging studies for detection of nodal metastases Nevertheless the ability to accurately identify nodal involvement preoperatively in patients with remains suboptimal ultrasound may complement EBUS particularly in cases where infradiaphragmatic nodal metastases are suspected,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,"[711, 152, 9, 393, 2164, 1097, 44, 401, 25, 4, 7, 5, 779, 196, 270, 16, 334, 28, 1434, 779, 799, 2, 9856, 2471, 746, 95, 16, 1, 154, 485, 22, 11087, 1945, 7080, 2, 2056, 1945, 3626, 32, 1481, 9, 779, 632, 1, 12, 21, 1237, 17, 491, 688, 40, 28, 506, 22, 745, 22, 4139, 9856, 9, 779, 632, 1, 2207, 365, 7, 5, 54, 11, 174, 1931, 9, 711, 152, 208, 498, 632, 5, 9856, 78, 212, 15, 7080, 78, 519, 2627, 7, 120, 208, 3626, 752, 2309, 623, 1101, 1594, 15, 30, 37, 10, 394, 9, 9856, 2, 874, 9, 7080, 19, 13, 144, 9856, 108, 67, 1, 212, 213, 7, 5, 779, 196, 977, 659, 846, 9856, 199, 7, 208, 152, 5, 779, 2874, 2, 125, 11, 203, 2133, 13508, 11087, 1945, 108, 233, 1, 519, 562, 7, 5, 779, 196, 737, 100, 717, 7080, 199, 7, 208, 152, 5, 779, 2874, 2, 125, 11, 79, 2133, 13508, 485, 2, 199, 464, 549, 9, 9856, 11, 339, 2, 739, 2, 728, 2, 696, 9, 7080, 2627, 7, 42, 3626, 3888, 92, 553, 30476, 779, 196, 4, 33, 7, 242, 26, 45, 16, 459, 7080, 42, 142, 485, 76, 361, 9856, 15, 270, 94, 9, 638, 1, 779, 196, 3873, 3, 801, 6, 2141, 255, 779, 799, 3888, 4, 7, 5, 469, 3291, 1945, 68, 3731, 7080, 823, 4, 140, 1257, 30476, 779, 196, 32, 2768]",1670.0,19699913,216
Tenascin-X is a novel diagnostic marker of malignant mesothelioma.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg.

The objective of this study was to validate this finding at the mRNA and protein levels. Effusions (n = 91; 71 ovarian carcinomas, 10 breast carcinomas, and 10 malignant mesotheliomas) were assayed for TNXB mRNA expression using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Tenascin-X protein expression was studied in 183 effusions (137 carcinomas of different origin, 37 mesotheliomas, and 9 reactive effusions) and 178 solid lesions (122 ovarian/peritoneal carcinomas and 56 mesotheliomas) using immunohistochemistry. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis showed significantly higher TNXB mRNA level in mesotheliomas compared with ovarian and breast carcinomas (P < 0.001). By immunohistochemistry, tenascin-X protein expression was significantly higher in malignant mesothelioma compared with metastatic carcinoma in effusions (34 of 37 vs. 31 of 137 positive cases; sensitivity = 92% and specificity = 77%; P < 0.001).

Hemithoracic radiotherapy after extrapleural pneumonectomy for malignant pleural mesothelioma: a dosimetric comparison of two well-described techniques.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2009-11-01,"Extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) with adjuvant radiotherapy may be used to treat malignant pleural mesothelioma. Radiation pneumonitis, felt to be related to contralateral lung radiation dose, may affect patient mortality in this setting. Two standard therapeutic approaches currently used to deliver adjuvant radiotherapy were compared in this study: intensity modulation radiation treatment (IMRT) with a planned dose of 45 Gray (Gy) and a modified electron-photon technique delivering 54 Gy. Treatment plans of 10 mesothelioma patients who underwent EPP and hemithoracic IMRT to a total dose of 45 Gy were analyzed. Plans using a combination of opposed anterior posterior radiation fields and electron supplementation (electron-photon technique [EPT]) to a total dose of 54 Gy were then generated and compared with IMRT plans. Dosimetric comparison revealed a significant reduction in contralateral lung dose with EPT versus IMRT, even with increased prescription dose used with EPT plans. Median heart and contralateral kidney doses were also significantly reduced with EPT versus IMRT. Dose coverage of planning target volume and doses to spinal cord, liver, and ipsilateral kidney were similar with use of the two techniques.

Cooperative group research efforts in thoracic malignancies 2009: a review from the 10th Annual International Lung Cancer Congress.,Clinical lung cancer,Clin Lung Cancer,2009-11-01,"Critical advances in the treatment of patients with lung cancer have occurred in the past few years. The cooperative groups in North America and internationally have played crucial roles in these advances. The leaders of the groups meet on a regular basis to review the progress of their trials. However, they rarely have a chance to discuss all ongoing and planned trials, except at the annual Lung Cancer Congress held each June. This article captures this exchange from the 10th Annual Lung Cancer Congress held in June 2009.

Dual control of antitumor CD8 T cells through the programmed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 pathway and immunosuppressive CD4 T cells: regulation and counterregulation.,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",J. Immunol.,2009-12-01,"Tumors have evolved multiple mechanisms to evade immune destruction. One of these is expression of T cell inhibitory ligands such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1; B7-H1). In this study, we show that PD-L1 is highly expressed on mesothelioma tumor cells and within the tumor stroma. However, PD-L1 blockade only marginally affected tumor growth and was associated with the emergence of activated programmed death-1(+) ICOS(+) CD4 T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes, whereas few activated CD8 T cells were present. Full activation of antitumor CD8 T cells, characterized as programmed death-1(+) ICOS(+) Ki-67(+) and displaying CTL activity, was only observed when CD4 T cells were depleted, suggesting that a population of suppressive CD4 T cells exists. ICOS(+) foxp3(+) regulatory T cells were found to be regulated through PD-L1, identifying one potentially suppressive CD4 T cell population. Thus, PD-L1 blockade activates antitumor CD8 T cell most potently in the absence of CD4 T cells.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors in malignant pleural mesothelioma: preclinical rationale and clinical trials.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2010-02-01,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare and aggressive cancer of the mesothelium with only a limited range of treatment options that are largely ineffective in improving survival. Recent efforts have turned toward the analysis of specific, dysregulated biologic pathways for insight into new treatment targets. Epigenetic regulation of tumor suppressor genes through chromatin condensation and decondensation has emerged as an important mechanism that leads to tumorogenesis. A family of histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases regulates this balance, with the latter facilitating chromatin condensation, thus preventing gene transcription, resulting in the loss of heterozygosity of tumor suppressors. Inhibition of this process, coupled with a similar inhibition of nonhistone protein deacetylation, ultimately leads to the promotion of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of angiogenesis. An increasing amount of preclinical data highlighting the effectiveness of histone deacetylase inhibition in MPM cell lines and mouse xenograft models has led to a number of early phase clinical trials in patients with MPM.

Pharmacol.,2010-02-02,"3-AP is a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor and has been postulated to act synergistically with other chemotherapeutic agents. This study was conducted to determine the toxicity and antitumor activity of 3-AP with irinotecan. Correlative studies included pharmacokinetics and the effects of ABCB1 and UGT1A1 polymorphisms. The treatment plan consisted of irinotecan on day 1 with 3-AP on days 1-3 of a 21-day cycle. Starting dose was irinotecan 150 mg/m(2) and 3-AP 85 mg/m(2) per day. Polymorphisms of ABCB1 were evaluated by pyrosequencing. Drug concentrations were determined by HPLC. Twenty-three patients were enrolled, 10 men and 13 women. Tumor types included seven patients with pancreatic cancer, four with lung cancer, two with cholangiocarcinoma, two with mesothelioma, two with ovarian cancer, and six with other malignancies. Two patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) at dose level 1, requiring amendment of the dose-escalation scheme. Maximal tolerated dose (MTD) was determined to be 3-AP 60 mg/m(2) per day and irinotecan 200 mg/m(2). DLTs consisted of hypoxia, leukopenia, fatigue, infection, thrombocytopenia, dehydration, and ALT elevation. One partial response in a patient with refractory non-small cell lung cancer was seen. Genotyping suggests that patients with wild-type ABCB1 have a higher rate of grade 3 or 4 toxicity than those with ABCB1 mutations. The MTD for this combination was 3-AP 60 mg/m(2) per day on days 1-3 and irinotecan 200 mg/m(2) on day 1 every 21 days.

Soluble mesothelin related peptides (SMRP) and osteopontin as protein biomarkers for malignant mesothelioma: analytical validation of ELISA based assays and characterization at mRNA and protein levels.,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,Clin. Chem. Lab. Med.,2010-02-01,"There is a need to identify reliable markers for malignant mesothelioma. Soluble mesothelin related peptides (SMRP) and osteopontin (OPN) have gained interest in recent years for this purpose. SMRP (Fujirebio Diagnostics Inc.) and OPN (R&D Inc.) ELISA methods were evaluated for multiple parameters. Concentrations were measured in blood from patients with mesothelioma, normal healthy volunteers, and patients with other (non-mesothelioma) cancers. In silico analysis was performed using the GeoProfiles database. At the protein level, SMRP and OPN were measured in cell culture supernatants, and values were compared in patients pre- and post-extrapleural pneumonectomy. The SMRP assay demonstrates intra-assay CVs of 2.3% and 3% (at 4.6 nM and 13.7 nM, respectively), and inter-assay CVs of 3.5% and 3.7% at the same concentrations. The limit of detection (LOD) is 0.182 nM. The OPN assay demonstrates intra-assay CVs of 5.8%, 4.1%, and 5.2% (at 1.9, 5.1, and 11.1 ng/mL, respectively), and inter-assay CVs of 8.5%, 8.4%, and 12.1% at the same concentrations. The LOD is 0.032 ng/mL. Both SMRP and OPN in mesothelioma patients were significantly higher than in patients with other (non-mesothelioma) cancer and in healthy volunteers. The two markers do not appear to correlate with each other and exhibit different tissue expression patterns. Protein concentrations of these markers are highest in different sets of cell lines. Finally, SMRP but not OPN concentrations were decreased in five of seven consecutive patients after extrapleural pneumonectomy, compared to their respective pre-operative values. These assays provide reliable and reproducible quantitation of SMRP and OPN proteins. Both are increased in mesothelioma patients compared to non-mesothelioma controls.

Assessment of therapy responses and prediction of survival in malignant pleural mesothelioma through computer-aided volumetric measurement on computed tomography scans.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2010-06-01,"The purposes of this study were (1) to calculate the tumor volume in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma using computed tomography (CT) scan images and a computer-aided measurement technique and (2) to investigate whether the baseline volume, or volume change after chemotherapy, predicts patient survival. We compiled the clinical characteristics and outcome from 30 patients enrolled in two clinical trials at our cancer center in which the patients were treated with induction chemotherapy followed by surgery and radiation. CT scans of 30 patients were obtained at baseline and after two cycles of chemotherapy. Tumor volumes were calculated using a semiautomated computer algorithm. Overall survival was measured using a landmark time at 3 months post-treatment start date such that all patients had already received two cycles of chemotherapy and a follow-up scan. Association of volume changes with overall survival were determined by a Cox Proportional Hazards Model or log-rank test. The relationship between both pre and postoperative clinical stage and baseline tumor volume was analyzed using the rank sum test. The median baseline tumor volume was 473 cm(3) (range, 61 cm(3)-2108 cm(3)). Patients with high preoperative stages (III and IV) had larger baseline tumor volume than those with low preoperative stages (I and II) (p = 0.05). Patients with baseline volumes smaller than 619 cm(3) tended to survive longer than those with baseline volumes larger than or equal to 619 cm(3) (p = 0.07). Percentage change of tumor volume from baseline to first follow-up CT after two cycles of chemotherapy was significantly associated with overall survival (hazard ratio: 1.94 [95% confidence interval, 1.05-3.60], p = 0.04). Whereas the relative change in modified RECIST measurements was not significantly associated with overall survival (hazard ratio: 1.06 [95% confidence interval, 0.96-1.16], p = 0.25). By classifying changes of tumor volumes between two scans into two groups, i.e., ""increase"" and ""decrease,"" a significant difference in survival was found between those who increased and decreased after two cycles of chemotherapy (p = 0.03). Changes in tumor volume after two cycles of chemotherapy predicted overall survival in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. Tumor volume at baseline was shown to be associated with preoperative clinical stage and survival. Computer-aided volumetric measurements may enable more reliable therapeutic response assessment and could provide additional prognostic information.",Journal Article,3521.0,56.0,The purposes of this study were 1 to calculate the tumor volume in patients with malignant pleural using computed tomography CT scan images and a computer-aided measurement technique and 2 to investigate whether the baseline volume or volume change after chemotherapy predicts patient survival We compiled the clinical characteristics and outcome from 30 patients enrolled in two clinical trials at our cancer center in which the patients were treated with induction chemotherapy followed by surgery and radiation CT scans of 30 patients were obtained at baseline and after two cycles of chemotherapy Tumor volumes were calculated using a semiautomated computer algorithm Overall survival was measured using a landmark time at 3 months post-treatment start date such that all patients had already received two cycles of chemotherapy and a follow-up scan Association of volume changes with overall survival were determined by a Cox Proportional Hazards Model or log-rank test The relationship between both pre and postoperative clinical stage and baseline tumor volume was analyzed using the rank sum test The median baseline tumor volume was 473 cm 3 range 61 cm 3 -2108 cm 3 Patients with high preoperative stages III and IV had larger baseline tumor volume than those with low preoperative stages I and II p 0.05 Patients with baseline volumes smaller than 619 cm 3 tended to survive longer than those with baseline volumes larger than or equal to 619 cm 3 p 0.07 Percentage change of tumor volume from baseline to first follow-up CT after two cycles of chemotherapy was significantly associated with overall survival hazard ratio 1.94 95 confidence interval 1.05-3.60 p 0.04 Whereas the relative change in modified RECIST measurements was not significantly associated with overall survival hazard ratio 1.06 95 confidence interval 0.96-1.16 p 0.25 By classifying changes of tumor volumes between two scans into two groups i.e. `` increase '' and `` decrease '' a significant difference in survival was found between those who increased and decreased after two cycles of chemotherapy p 0.03 Changes in tumor volume after two cycles of chemotherapy predicted overall survival in patients with malignant pleural Tumor volume at baseline was shown to be associated with preoperative clinical stage and survival Computer-aided volumetric measurements may enable more reliable therapeutic response assessment and could provide additional prognostic information,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 4624, 1, 26, 45, 11, 14, 6, 3232, 3, 30, 433, 4, 7, 5, 393, 2164, 75, 1220, 872, 425, 1657, 1572, 2, 8, 4236, 8783, 2204, 1312, 2, 18, 6, 963, 317, 3, 330, 433, 15, 433, 707, 50, 56, 2623, 69, 25, 21, 8535, 3, 38, 374, 2, 228, 29, 201, 7, 346, 4, 100, 38, 143, 28, 114, 12, 574, 4, 92, 3, 7, 11, 73, 5, 504, 56, 370, 20, 152, 2, 121, 425, 1441, 1, 201, 7, 11, 683, 28, 330, 2, 50, 100, 410, 1, 56, 30, 2225, 11, 981, 75, 8, 12574, 4236, 2124, 63, 25, 10, 644, 75, 8, 3829, 98, 28, 27, 53, 539, 24, 2435, 1244, 225, 17, 62, 7, 42, 3298, 103, 100, 410, 1, 56, 2, 8, 166, 126, 1657, 248, 1, 433, 400, 5, 63, 25, 11, 509, 20, 8, 418, 831, 1017, 202, 15, 1066, 1026, 412, 3, 858, 59, 110, 671, 2, 573, 38, 82, 2, 330, 30, 433, 10, 311, 75, 3, 1026, 3216, 412, 3, 52, 330, 30, 433, 10, 10098, 494, 27, 184, 713, 494, 27, 58895, 494, 27, 7, 5, 64, 498, 1153, 316, 2, 478, 42, 1077, 330, 30, 433, 76, 135, 5, 154, 498, 1153, 70, 2, 215, 19, 13, 474, 7, 5, 330, 2225, 2170, 76, 14277, 494, 27, 3886, 6, 4573, 589, 76, 135, 5, 330, 2225, 1077, 76, 15, 2997, 6, 14277, 494, 27, 19, 13, 1615, 1150, 707, 1, 30, 433, 29, 330, 6, 157, 166, 126, 425, 50, 100, 410, 1, 56, 10, 97, 41, 5, 63, 25, 360, 197, 14, 960, 48, 307, 268, 14, 474, 27, 335, 19, 13, 755, 547, 3, 580, 707, 4, 1230, 1834, 1685, 10, 44, 97, 41, 5, 63, 25, 360, 197, 14, 1460, 48, 307, 268, 13, 921, 14, 245, 19, 13, 243, 20, 8681, 400, 1, 30, 2225, 59, 100, 1441, 237, 100, 271, 70, 563, 344, 522, 2, 775, 522, 8, 93, 523, 4, 25, 10, 204, 59, 135, 54, 101, 2, 340, 50, 100, 410, 1, 56, 19, 13, 680, 400, 4, 30, 433, 50, 100, 410, 1, 56, 783, 63, 25, 4, 7, 5, 393, 2164, 30, 433, 28, 330, 10, 443, 6, 40, 41, 5, 498, 38, 82, 2, 25, 4236, 8783, 4083, 1685, 68, 3047, 80, 2450, 189, 51, 455, 2, 359, 377, 402, 177, 487]",2457.0,20421814,117
WT1 peptide vaccinations induce CD4 and CD8 T cell immune responses in patients with mesothelioma and non-small cell lung cancer.,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",Cancer Immunol. Immunother.,2010-06-08,"The transcription factor, WT1, is highly overexpressed in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and immunohistochemical stains for WT1 are used routinely to aid in its diagnosis. Using computer prediction analysis we designed analog peptides derived from WT1 sequences by substituting amino acids at key HLA-A0201 binding positions. We tested the safety and immunogenicity of a WT1 vaccine comprised of four class I and class II peptides in patients with thoracic neoplasms expressing WT1. Therapy consisted of six subcutaneous vaccinations administered with Montanide adjuvant on weeks 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, with 6 additional monthly injections for responding patients. Injection sites were pre-stimulated with GM-CSF (70 mcg). Immune responses were evaluated by DTH, CD4 T-cell proliferation, CD8 T-cell interferon gamma release, intracellular cytokine staining, WT1 peptide MHC-tetramer staining, and cytotoxicity against WT1 positive tumor cells. Nine patients with MPM and 3 with NSCLC were vaccinated, with 8 patients receiving at least 6 vaccinations; in total, 10 patients were evaluable for immune response. Six out of nine patients tested demonstrated CD4 T-cell proliferation to WT1 specific peptides, and five of the six HLA-A0201 patients tested mounted a CD8 T-cell response. Stimulated T cells were capable of cytotoxicity against WT-1 positive cells. Vaccination also induced polyfunctional CD8 T cell responses.

This phase I trial evaluated the triplet of docetaxel, gemcitabine and imatinib. Imatinib was administered at 400 mg daily on days 1-5, 8-12 and 15-19. Gemcitabine was started at 600 mg/m(2) at a rate of 10 mg/min on days 3 and 10 and docetaxel at 30 mg/m(2) on day 10, on a 21-day cycle. Diffusion and dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion MRI was performed in selected patients. Twenty patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumors were enrolled in this IRB-approved study. The mean age was 64, and mean ECOG PS was 1. Two patients were evaluated by diffusion/perfusion MRI. After two grade 3 hematological toxicities at dose level 1, the protocol was amended to reduce the dose of imatinib. MTDs were 600 mg/ m(2) on days 3 and 10 for gemcitabine, 30 mg/ m(2) on day 10 for docetaxel, and 400 mg daily on days 1-5 and 8-12 for imatinib. Dose limiting toxicities after one cycle were neutropenic fever, and pleural and pericardial effusions.

From 2004-2007, we treated 11 MPM patients with hemithoracic IMRT, 7 of whom had undergone porfimer sodium-mediated PDT as an intraoperative adjuvant to surgical debulking. The median radiation dose to the planning treatment volume (PTV) ranged from 45.4-54.5 Gy. For the contralateral lung, V20 ranged from 1.4-28.5%, V5 from 42-100% and MLD from 6.8-16.5 Gy. In our series, 1 patient experienced respiratory failure secondary to radiation pneumonitis that did not require mechanical ventilation.

MM patients who had received 0 to 1 prior chemotherapy regimens were treated with sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily continuously. The primary end point was objective response. ERK1/2 phosphorylation in archival tissues was correlated with response and survival. A total of 51 patients were enrolled, 50 were evaluable and included in the analysis. Three patients had a partial response (6% [95% confidence interval = 1.3-16.6%]), and 27 (54% [95% confidence interval = 39.3-68.2%]) had stable disease. Median progression-free survival and median overall survival (OS) were 3.6 and 9.7 months, respectively. Median survival was superior in epithelioid histology versus other types (10.7 versus 3.7 months, p = 0.0179). The difference in median OS between pretreated and chemonaive patients was not statistically significant (13.2 versus 5 months, p = 0.3117).

Quantitative measurement of lung reexpansion in malignant pleural mesothelioma patients undergoing pleurectomy/decortication.,Academic radiology,Acad Radiol,2010-12-10,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a neoplasm that grows circumferentially along the pleura. The tumor and concurrent pleural effusion may reduce lung function by restricting or preventing lung expansion. The purpose of this study was to provide objective evidence that pleurectomy/decortication (P/D) allows trapped lung to reexpand, quantify the reexpansion based on computed tomography (CT) scans, and investigate whether the expansion persists after surgery. A database of 12 patients demonstrating unilateral MPM was collected. Each patient underwent a presurgical CT scan, surgical debulking by P/D, and two postsurgical CT scans (at 1 and 4 months). The lung volume was measured in each scan using an automated algorithm and compared for each patient across time. An increase in the ipsilateral postsurgical lung volume was observed for 10 of 12 patients (83%) 1 month after surgery. The median ipsilateral volume increase was 44% relative to the presurgical ipsilateral volume and 21% relative to the contralateral volume.

"Phase I studies of CBP501, a G2 checkpoint abrogator, as monotherapy and in combination with cisplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2011-01-10,"Two phase I dose-escalation studies were conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety profile of the G(2) checkpoint abrogator CBP501, as a single agent and in combination with cisplatin. Patients with advanced solid tumors were treated with CBP501 alone (D1/D8/D15, q4w, from 0.9 mg/m(2)), or with cisplatin (both on D1, q3w, from 3.6 mg/m(2) CBP501, 50 mg/m(2) cisplatin). Dose escalation proceeded if dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed in 1 or less of 3 to 6 patients; CBP501 dose increments were implemented according to the incidence of toxicity. MTD was determined from DLTs occurring during the first two cycles. In the combination study, the DLT was a histamine-release syndrome (HRS) occurring 10 to 60 minutes after initiating infusion that was attenuated by prophylaxis comprising dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, ranitidine, and loratadine. The MTD was 25 mg/m(2) CBP501 and 75 mg/m(2) cisplatin, with two patients at the highest dose (36.4 mg/m(2) CBP501, 75 mg/m(2) cisplatin) experiencing grade 3 HRS. The only DLT with monotherapy was transient G(3) rise of troponin in one patient. Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related events were rare. Promising activity was observed with CBP501/cisplatin, mainly in ovarian and mesothelioma patients who had previously progressed on platinum-containing regimens. Among ovarian cancer patients, low expression of DNA repair proteins was associated with partial response or stable disease. CBP501 is well tolerated in patients as monotherapy and with cisplatin. At the recommended phase II dose (RP2D), the combination is feasible and HRS manageable with prophylaxis. Evidence of antitumor activity was observed in platinum-resistant patients.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",3298.0,22.0,Two phase I dose-escalation studies were conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose MTD and safety profile of the G 2 checkpoint abrogator CBP501 as a single agent and in combination with cisplatin Patients with advanced solid tumors were treated with CBP501 alone D1/D8/D15 q4w from 0.9 mg/m 2 or with cisplatin both on D1 q3w from 3.6 mg/m 2 CBP501 50 mg/m 2 cisplatin Dose escalation proceeded if dose-limiting toxicity DLT was observed in 1 or less of 3 to 6 patients CBP501 dose increments were implemented according to the incidence of toxicity MTD was determined from DLTs occurring during the first two cycles In the combination study the DLT was a histamine-release syndrome HRS occurring 10 to 60 minutes after initiating infusion that was attenuated by prophylaxis comprising dexamethasone diphenhydramine ranitidine and loratadine The MTD was 25 mg/m 2 CBP501 and 75 mg/m 2 cisplatin with two patients at the highest dose 36.4 mg/m 2 CBP501 75 mg/m 2 cisplatin experiencing grade 3 HRS The only DLT with monotherapy was transient G 3 rise of troponin in one patient Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related events were rare Promising activity was observed with CBP501/cisplatin mainly in and patients who had previously progressed on platinum-containing regimens Among cancer patients low expression of DNA repair proteins was associated with partial response or stable disease CBP501 is well tolerated in patients as monotherapy and with cisplatin At the recommended phase II dose RP2D the combination is feasible and HRS manageable with prophylaxis Evidence of antitumor activity was observed in platinum-resistant patients,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[100, 124, 70, 61, 1125, 94, 11, 426, 6, 223, 3, 689, 421, 61, 961, 2, 367, 800, 1, 3, 499, 18, 986, 30325, 25317, 22, 8, 226, 420, 2, 4, 150, 5, 540, 7, 5, 131, 537, 57, 11, 73, 5, 25317, 279, 2146, 27015, 25318, 39517, 29, 13, 83, 81, 188, 18, 15, 5, 540, 110, 23, 2146, 7571, 29, 27, 49, 81, 188, 18, 25317, 212, 81, 188, 18, 540, 61, 1125, 6406, 492, 61, 817, 155, 2059, 10, 164, 4, 14, 15, 299, 1, 27, 6, 49, 7, 25317, 61, 8225, 11, 3426, 768, 6, 3, 287, 1, 155, 961, 10, 509, 29, 2506, 1821, 190, 3, 157, 100, 410, 4, 3, 150, 45, 3, 2059, 10, 8, 17601, 2008, 681, 2733, 1821, 79, 6, 335, 2511, 50, 2637, 904, 17, 10, 2656, 20, 2049, 3538, 1217, 15481, 35039, 2, 59716, 3, 961, 10, 243, 81, 188, 18, 25317, 2, 481, 81, 188, 18, 540, 5, 100, 7, 28, 3, 1076, 61, 511, 39, 81, 188, 18, 25317, 481, 81, 188, 18, 540, 2985, 88, 27, 2733, 3, 158, 2059, 5, 1411, 10, 2473, 499, 27, 3693, 1, 9092, 4, 104, 69, 88, 27, 6, 39, 24, 139, 281, 11, 622, 721, 128, 10, 164, 5, 25317, 540, 2615, 4, 2, 7, 54, 42, 373, 1839, 23, 828, 1101, 472, 107, 12, 7, 154, 55, 1, 261, 972, 652, 10, 41, 5, 450, 51, 15, 585, 34, 25317, 16, 149, 421, 4, 7, 22, 1411, 2, 5, 540, 28, 3, 793, 124, 215, 61, 3977, 3, 150, 16, 1313, 2, 2733, 2808, 5, 2049, 241, 1, 579, 128, 10, 164, 4, 828, 436, 7]",1634.0,21220472,80

Pleomorphic epithelioid diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma: a clinicopathological review and conceptual proposal to reclassify as biphasic or sarcomatoid mesothelioma.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2011-05-01,"In patients with epithelioid diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma (DMPM), clinical stage is the current primary prognostic factor. We sought to investigate whether histologic subtyping can prognostically stratify patients with epithelioid DMPM. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides of 232 patients with epithelioid DMPM (14 stage I, 54 stage II, 130 stage III, and 34 stage IV) from a single institution were reviewed. We classified the tumors into five subtypes, according to the predominant histological pattern: trabecular, tubulopapillary, micropapillary, solid, and pleomorphic (≥10% of tumor). Median overall survival (OS) of all patients with epithelioid DMPM was 16.2 months. Patients with pleomorphic subtype (n = 34) had the worst median OS (8.1 months), followed by solid (n = 89, 13.7 months), micropapillary (n = 20, 15.8 months), tubulopapillary (n = 51, 17.9 months), and trabecular (n = 38, 24.9 months). The pleomorphic subtype was associated with lymphatic and vascular invasion (p < 0.001). The micropapillary subtype was associated with lymphatic invasion (p < 0.001). In univariate analyses, pleomorphic subtype was significantly associated with poor OS (p = 0.003). The pleomorphic subtype showed no significant difference on OS compared with biphasic and sarcomatoid DMPM.

Computerized segmentation and measurement of malignant pleural mesothelioma.,Medical physics,Med Phys,2011-01-01,"The current linear method to track tumor progression and evaluate treatment efficacy is insufficient for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). A volumetric method for tumor measurement could improve the evaluation of novel treatments, but a fully manual implementation of volume measurement is too tedious and time-consuming. This manuscript presents a computerized method for the three-dimensional segmentation and volumetric analysis of MPM. The computerized MPM segmentation method segments the lung parenchyma and hemithoracic cavities to define the pleural space. Nonlinear diffusion and a k-means classifier are then implemented to identify MPM in the pleural space. A database of 31 computed tomography scans from 31 patients with pathologically confirmed MPM was retrospectively collected. Three observers independently outlined five randomly selected sections in each scan. The Jaccard similarity coefficient (J) between each of the observers and between the observer-defined and computer-defined segmentations was calculated. The computer-defined and the observer-defined segmentation areas (averaged over all observers) were both calculated for each axial section and compared using Bland-Altman plots. The median J value among observers averaged over all sections was 0.517. The median J between the computer-defined and manual segmentations was 0.484. The difference between these values was not statistically significant. The area delineated by the computerized method demonstrated variability and bias comparable to the tumor area calculated from manual delineations. A computerized method for segmentation and measurement of MPM was developed. This method requires minimal initialization by the user and demonstrated good agreement with manually drawn outlines and area measurements.

Photodynamic therapy and the evolution of a lung-sparing surgical treatment for mesothelioma.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2011-06-01,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a light-based cancer treatment that acts to a depth of several millimeters into tissue. This study reviewed the results of patients who underwent a macroscopic complete resection, by two different surgical techniques, and intraoperative PDT as a treatment for malignant pleural mesothelioma. From 2004 to 2008, 28 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma underwent macroscopic complete resection, 14 by modified extrapleural pneumonectomy (MEPP) and 14 by radical pleurectomy (RP) and intraoperative PDT. The surgical technique evolved over this period such that 13 of the last 16 patients underwent lung-sparing procedures, even in the setting of large-bulk tumors. Demographics in the MEPP and RP cohorts were similar in age, sex, stage, nodal status, histology, and adjuvant treatments. Stage III/IV disease was present in 12 of 14 patients (86%), with 50% or more with +N2 disease. The median overall survival for the MEPP group was 8.4 months, but has not yet been reached for the RP group at a median follow-up of 2.1 years. In addition to the inherent advantages of sparing the lung, RP plus PDT yielded a superior overall survival than MEPP plus PDT in this series. The overall survival for the RP plus PDT group was, for unclear reasons, superior to results reported in many surgical series, especially for a cohort with such advanced disease. Given these results, we believe RP plus PDT is a reasonable option for appropriate patients pursuing a surgical treatment for malignant pleural mesothelioma and that this procedure can serve as the backbone of surgically based multimodal treatments.",Journal Article,3156.0,45.0,Photodynamic therapy PDT is a light-based cancer treatment that acts to a depth of several millimeters into tissue This study reviewed the results of patients who underwent a macroscopic complete resection by two different surgical techniques and intraoperative PDT as a treatment for malignant pleural From 2004 to 2008 28 patients with malignant pleural underwent macroscopic complete resection 14 by modified extrapleural pneumonectomy MEPP and 14 by radical pleurectomy RP and intraoperative PDT The surgical technique evolved over this period such that 13 of the last 16 patients underwent lung-sparing procedures even in the setting of large-bulk tumors Demographics in the MEPP and RP cohorts were similar in age sex stage nodal status histology and adjuvant treatments Stage III/IV disease was present in 12 of 14 patients 86 with 50 or more with +N2 disease The median overall survival for the MEPP group was 8.4 months but has not yet been reached for the RP group at a median follow-up of 2.1 years In addition to the inherent advantages of sparing the RP plus PDT yielded a superior overall survival than MEPP plus PDT in this series The overall survival for the RP plus PDT group was for unclear reasons superior to results reported in many surgical series especially for a cohort with such advanced disease Given these results we believe RP plus PDT is a reasonable option for appropriate patients pursuing a surgical treatment for malignant pleural and that this procedure can serve as the backbone of surgically based multimodal treatments,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6910, 36, 3442, 16, 8, 1691, 90, 12, 24, 17, 4459, 6, 8, 2436, 1, 392, 22032, 237, 246, 26, 45, 446, 3, 99, 1, 7, 54, 208, 8, 5897, 236, 170, 20, 100, 338, 221, 1092, 2, 1720, 3442, 22, 8, 24, 9, 393, 2164, 29, 1131, 6, 1375, 339, 7, 5, 393, 2164, 208, 5897, 236, 170, 213, 20, 1230, 9113, 4853, 35123, 2, 213, 20, 711, 10707, 1622, 2, 1720, 3442, 3, 221, 1312, 3937, 252, 26, 727, 225, 17, 233, 1, 3, 1060, 245, 7, 208, 5184, 1851, 1369, 871, 4, 3, 546, 1, 375, 5821, 57, 2221, 4, 3, 35123, 2, 1622, 736, 11, 288, 4, 89, 1035, 82, 779, 156, 784, 2, 249, 640, 82, 316, 478, 34, 10, 364, 4, 133, 1, 213, 7, 868, 5, 212, 15, 80, 5, 3473, 34, 3, 52, 63, 25, 9, 3, 35123, 87, 10, 66, 39, 53, 84, 71, 44, 1145, 85, 1300, 9, 3, 1622, 87, 28, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 18, 14, 60, 4, 352, 6, 3, 4943, 3126, 1, 1851, 3, 1622, 349, 3442, 2178, 8, 1123, 63, 25, 76, 35123, 349, 3442, 4, 26, 988, 3, 63, 25, 9, 3, 1622, 349, 3442, 87, 10, 9, 1200, 2325, 1123, 6, 99, 210, 4, 445, 221, 988, 1093, 9, 8, 180, 5, 225, 131, 34, 447, 46, 99, 21, 4629, 1622, 349, 3442, 16, 8, 3203, 1501, 9, 870, 7, 10692, 8, 221, 24, 9, 393, 2164, 2, 17, 26, 1299, 122, 1833, 22, 3, 7066, 1, 2350, 90, 4122, 640]",1555.0,21619970,150

Chronic inflammation in tumor stroma is an independent predictor of prolonged survival in epithelioid malignant pleural mesothelioma patients.,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",Cancer Immunol. Immunother.,2011-07-19,"This study aims to determine whether a semi-quantitative assessment of inflammatory response in tumor and stroma on routine hematoxylin and eosin-stained (H&E) slides can predict survival in patients with epithelioid malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). H&E sections of 175 epithelioid MPM specimens from a single institution (1989-2009) were reviewed. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded from analysis. Each tumor was histologically assessed for acute and chronic inflammatory response both within the tumor and the stromal component. Inflammatory response was graded: low (none to mild infiltrate) or high (moderate to severe infiltrate). Log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to investigate the association between the degree of inflammation (acute/tumor, acute/stroma, chronic/tumor, and chronic/stroma) and overall survival (OS). Patients with high chronic inflammatory response in stroma (n = 59) had improved survival compared to low (n = 116) (median OS = 19.4 vs. 15.0 months, P = 0.01). This prognostic stratification remained significant in stage III patients (median OS = 16.0 vs. 9.3 months, P = 0.03).

Coactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases in malignant mesothelioma as a rationale for combination targeted therapy.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2011-05-01,"To identify new therapeutic approaches in malignant mesothelioma (MM), we examined the expression and activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the effects of specific RTK inhibitors and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin; the latter being of special interest in MM given the recent linkage between NF2 loss and mTOR activation. We performed a screen for mutated or activated RTKs in 14 MM cell lines and 70 primary tumors. Expression of phosphorylated RTKs was analyzed by Western blotting and a membrane-based antibody array in normal growth conditions and after treatment by specific inhibitors. MET and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations were screened by sequencing. MET, hepatocyte growth factor, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, and EGFR expression were studied by Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and by Affymetrix expression microarrays. Profiling of the phosphorylation status of 42 RTKs showed prominent coactivation of MET and EGFR in 8 of 14 (57%) MM cell lines. MET, EGFR, and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor were the main RTKs activated after mTOR inhibition and contributed to AKT feedback activation. Knockdown of MET by RNA interference inhibited not only the phosphorylation of MET but also that of EGFR. Conversely, stimulation with hepatocyte growth factor increased both phospho-MET and phospho-EGFR. The combination of PHA-665752 and the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, suppressed cell growth more than either agent alone in three of six cell lines tested. Finally, combinations of rapamycin and different RTK inhibitors were more active than either drug alone in 12 of 13 cell lines.

Median overall survival of all patients was 16 months and correlated with nuclear atypia (P<0.001), chromatin pattern (P=0.031), prominence of nucleoli (P<0.001), mitotic count (P<0.001), and atypical mitoses (P<0.001) by univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed nuclear atypia (P=0.012) and mitotic count (P<0.001) as independent prognostic factors, and these two factors were utilized to create a three-tier nuclear grade score. The resulting nuclear grade stratified patients into three distinct prognostic groups: grade I (n=107, median overall survival=28 months), grade II (n=91, 14 months), and grade III (n=34, 5 months). Not only was nuclear grade an independent predictor of overall survival (P<0.001), but it was also a stronger discriminator of survival than all currently available factors. Furthermore, nuclear grade was associated with time to recurrence (P=0.004) in patients who underwent complete surgical resection (n=159). MIB-1 labeling index correlated with mitotic count (P<0.001) and nuclear atypia (P=0.037) and stratified overall survival (P<0.001) and time to recurrence (P=0.048), confirming the prognostic value of the nuclear grade.

A live-attenuated Listeria vaccine (ANZ-100) and a live-attenuated Listeria vaccine expressing mesothelin (CRS-207) for advanced cancers: phase I studies of safety and immune induction.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2011-12-06,"Listeria monocytogenes (Lm)-based vaccines stimulate both innate and adaptive immunity. ANZ-100 is a live-attenuated Lm strain (Lm ΔactA/ΔinlB). Uptake by phagocytes in the liver results in local inflammatory responses and activation and recruitment of natural killer (NK) and T cells, in association with increased survival of mice bearing hepatic metastases. The Lm ΔactA/ΔinlB strain, engineered to express human mesothelin (CRS-207), a tumor-associated antigen expressed by a variety of tumors, induces mesothelin-specific T-cell responses against mesothelin-expressing murine tumors. These two phase I studies test ANZ-100 and CRS-207 in subjects with liver metastases and mesothelin-expressing cancers, respectively. A single intravenous injection of ANZ-100 was evaluated in a dose escalation study in subjects with liver metastases. Nine subjects received 1 × 10(6), 3 × 10(7), or 3 × 10(8) colony-forming units (cfu). CRS-207 was evaluated in a dose-escalation study in subjects with mesothelioma, lung, pancreatic, or ovarian cancers. Seventeen subjects received up to 4 doses of 1 × 10(8), 3 × 10(8), 1 × 10(9), or 1 × 10(10) cfu. A single infusion of ANZ-100 was well tolerated to the maximum planned dose. Adverse events included transient laboratory abnormalities and symptoms associated with cytokine release. Multiple infusions of CRS-207 were well tolerated up to 1 × 10(9) cfu, the determined maximum tolerated dose. Immune activation was observed for both ANZ-100 and CRS-207 as measured by serum cytokine/chemokine levels and NK cell activation. In the CRS-207 study, listeriolysin O and mesothelin-specific T-cell responses were detected and 37% of subjects lived ≥15 months.

The influence of MSLN overexpression on MPM cell invasion was assessed in an orthotopic mouse model and in patient samples. MSLN expression promotes MPM cell invasion and MMP secretion in both human and murine MPM cells. In an orthotopic MPM mouse model characterized by our laboratory, MPM cells with MSLN overexpression preferentially localized to the tumor invading edge, colocalized with MMP-9 expression, and promoted decreased survival without an increase in tumor burden progression. In a tissue microarray from epithelioid MPM patients (n = 139, 729 cores), MSLN overexpression correlated with higher MMP-9 expression at individual core level. Among stage III MPM patients (n = 72), high MSLN expression was observed in 26% of T2 tumors and 51% of T3 tumors. Our data provide evidence elucidating a biologic role for MSLN as a factor promoting tumor invasion and MMP-9 expression in MSLN expressing MPM. As regional invasion is the characteristic feature in MSLN expressing solid cancers (MPM, pancreas, and ovarian), our observations add rationale to studies investigating MSLN as a therapeutic target.",Journal Article,2885.0,74.0,Mesothelin MSLN is a tumor-associated antigen being investigated as a biomarker and therapeutic target in malignant pleural MPM The biologic function of MSLN overexpression in MPM is unknown We hypothesized that MSLN may promote tumor invasion in MPM a tumor characterized primarily by regional aggressiveness and rare distant metastases Human and murine MPM cells with MSLN forced expression and short hairpin RNA knockdown were examined for proliferation invasion and matrix metalloproteinase MMP secretion The influence of MSLN overexpression on MPM cell invasion was assessed in an orthotopic mouse model and in patient samples MSLN expression promotes MPM cell invasion and MMP secretion in both human and murine MPM cells In an orthotopic MPM mouse model characterized by our laboratory MPM cells with MSLN overexpression preferentially localized to the tumor invading edge colocalized with MMP-9 expression and promoted decreased survival without an increase in tumor burden progression In a tissue microarray from epithelioid MPM patients n 139 729 cores MSLN overexpression correlated with higher MMP-9 expression at individual core level Among stage III MPM patients n 72 high MSLN expression was observed in 26 of T2 tumors and 51 of T3 tumors Our data provide evidence elucidating a biologic role for MSLN as a factor promoting tumor invasion and MMP-9 expression in MSLN expressing MPM As regional invasion is the characteristic feature in MSLN expressing solid cancers MPM and our observations add rationale to studies investigating MSLN as a therapeutic target,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[5402, 11880, 16, 8, 30, 41, 448, 486, 565, 22, 8, 901, 2, 189, 283, 4, 393, 2164, 3278, 3, 1283, 343, 1, 11880, 851, 4, 3278, 16, 860, 21, 1237, 17, 11880, 68, 1617, 30, 578, 4, 3278, 8, 30, 765, 1561, 20, 951, 3908, 2, 622, 626, 196, 171, 2, 1471, 3278, 37, 5, 11880, 5216, 55, 2, 978, 5957, 893, 1563, 11, 409, 9, 457, 578, 2, 2248, 4914, 2151, 2935, 3, 1054, 1, 11880, 851, 23, 3278, 31, 578, 10, 275, 4, 35, 2157, 830, 202, 2, 4, 69, 347, 11880, 55, 2148, 3278, 31, 578, 2, 2151, 2935, 4, 110, 171, 2, 1471, 3278, 37, 4, 35, 2157, 3278, 830, 202, 765, 20, 114, 1624, 3278, 37, 5, 11880, 851, 3509, 909, 6, 3, 30, 8653, 7951, 16625, 5, 2151, 83, 55, 2, 2992, 340, 25, 187, 35, 344, 4, 30, 892, 91, 4, 8, 246, 1727, 29, 3838, 3278, 7, 78, 4929, 17660, 4357, 11880, 851, 438, 5, 142, 2151, 83, 55, 28, 797, 1793, 301, 107, 82, 316, 3278, 7, 78, 720, 64, 11880, 55, 10, 164, 4, 432, 1, 1786, 57, 2, 725, 1, 2065, 57, 114, 74, 377, 241, 7980, 8, 1283, 200, 9, 11880, 22, 8, 161, 2388, 30, 578, 2, 2151, 83, 55, 4, 11880, 1046, 3278, 22, 951, 578, 16, 3, 2037, 2705, 4, 11880, 1046, 537, 163, 3278, 2, 114, 2172, 4178, 1728, 6, 94, 3103, 11880, 22, 8, 189, 283]",1575.0,22371455,12

We also measured plasma vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor b and colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) and mesothelin-related protein at baseline and during therapy. Forty-six patients were enrolled in this study. Fifty percent of the first 12 patients enrolled experienced ≥grade 3 treatment-related adverse events, and therefore, the starting dose was reduced to 50 mg twice daily.

Unusual DNA mismatch repair-deficient tumors in Lynch syndrome: a report of new cases and review of the literature.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2012-04-17,"Immunohistochemical detection of DNA mismatch repair proteins and polymerase chain reaction detection of microsatellite instability have enhanced the recognition of mismatch repair-deficient neoplasms in patients with Lynch syndrome and, consequently, led to the identification of tumors that have not been included in the currently known Lynch syndrome tumor spectrum. Here, we report 4 such unusual tumors. Three of the 4, a peritoneal mesothelioma, a pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma, and a pancreatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor, represented tumor types that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been previously reported in Lynch syndrome. The fourth tumor was an adrenocortical carcinoma, which has rarely been reported previously in Lynch syndrome. Three of our 4 patients carried a pathogenic germ-line mutation in a mismatch repair gene. The unusual tumor in each of the 3 patients showed loss of the mismatch repair protein corresponding to the mutation. The fourth patient did not have mutation information but had a history of colonic and endometrial carcinomas; both lacked MSH2 and MSH6 proteins. Interestingly, none of the 4 unusual tumors revealed microsatellite instability on polymerase chain reaction testing, whereas an appendiceal carcinoma from 1 of the study patients who was tested simultaneously did. The recognition of such tumors expands the repertoire of usable test samples for the workup of high-risk families.

Radical pleurectomy and intraoperative photodynamic therapy for malignant pleural mesothelioma.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac.

The purpose of this study was to review our experience using RP and intraoperative photodynamic therapy (PDT) for mesothelioma. Thirty-eight patients (42-81 years) underwent RP-PDT. Thirty five of 38 (92%) patients also received systemic therapy. Standard statistical techniques were used for analysis.

High SUVmax on FDG-PET indicates pleomorphic subtype in epithelioid malignant pleural mesothelioma: supportive evidence to reclassify pleomorphic as nonepithelioid histology.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2012-07-01,"We have recently proposed to reclassify the pleomorphic subtype of epithelioid malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) as nonepithelioid (biphasic/sarcomatoid) histology because of its similarly poor prognosis. We sought to investigate whether preoperative maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) on F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) correlates with histologic subtype in MPM. Clinical data were collected for 78 patients with MPM who underwent preoperative FDG-PET. We retrospectively classified the epithelioid tumors into five subtypes: trabecular, tubulopapillary, micropapillary, solid, and pleomorphic. Tumors were categorized by SUVmax into two groups: low (<10.0) and high (≥10.0). The median overall survival of epithelioid tumors with high SUVmax (n = 12) was significantly shorter (7.1 months) than that of epithelioid tumors with low SUVmax (n = 54, 18.9 months, p < 0.001) and comparable to nonepithelioid tumors (n = 12, 7.2 months). Epithelioid tumors with pleomorphic subtype (n = 9) had marginally higher SUVmax (mean ± SD: 10.6 ± 5.9) than epithelioid nonpleomorphic subtype (n = 57, 6.5 ± 3.2, p = 0.050), and were comparable to that of nonepithelioid tumors (n = 12, 9.1 ± 4.8). Among the epithelioid tumors with high SUVmax (n = 12), 50% (n = 6) showed pleomorphic subtype. In contrast, among epithelioid tumors with low SUVmax (n = 54), 6% (n = 3) showed epithelioid pleomorphic subtypes (p = 0.001).

Eligible patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1 and no thrombosis, bleeding, or major blood vessel invasion. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Patients were stratified by ECOG performance status (0 v 1) and histologic subtype (epithelial v other). Patients received gemcitabine 1,250 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 every 21 days, cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) every 21 days, and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg or placebo every 21 days for six cycles, and then bevacizumab or placebo every 21 days until progression.

We conducted a multi-center phase II trial of cediranib in patients with unresectable, histologically-confirmed MM who had received ≤1 prior regimen of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was objective response rate. Initial cediranib dosing was 45 mg daily during a 28-day cycle. Due to substantial toxicity, the starting dose was subsequently lowered to 30 mg daily. Fifty-one patients enrolled at 9 centers; 50 were evaluable for response. Partial responses were observed in 10% of patients; stable disease was seen in 34%. Disease control (PR+SD) was higher at the 45 mg cediranib dose level (67% vs. 34%, p=0.04). Median progression-free survival was 1.8 months (95% CI 0.1, 14.2); median overall survival (OS) was 4.4 months (95% CI 0.9, 41.7). The 1-year survival rate was 15%.

Loss of the tumor suppressor BAP1 causes myeloid transformation.,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",Science,2012-08-09,"De-ubiquitinating enzyme BAP1 is mutated in a hereditary cancer syndrome with increased risk of mesothelioma and uveal melanoma. Somatic BAP1 mutations occur in various malignancies. We show that mouse Bap1 gene deletion is lethal during embryogenesis, but systemic or hematopoietic-restricted deletion in adults recapitulates features of human myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Knockin mice expressing BAP1 with a 3xFlag tag revealed that BAP1 interacts with host cell factor-1 (HCF-1), O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT), and the polycomb group proteins ASXL1 and ASXL2 in vivo.

Quality of life after radical pleurectomy decortication for malignant pleural mesothelioma.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2012-08-24,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma is an aggressive malignancy in which radical surgical treatment appears to improve survival. It is unknown, however, if radical surgical treatment affects quality of life (QoL) adversely. Our objective was to assess patient-reported symptoms of health-related QoL after radical pleurectomy decortication (PD). Patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma were prospectively enrolled between 2010 and 2011 to determine the effects of PD on baseline QoL. Health-related QoL was assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 tool (EORTC QLQ-C30) before operation and at 1, 5 to 6, and 8 to 9 months postoperatively. Patients were grouped based on World Health Organization baseline performance status (PS) and compared. Of the 28 patients enrolled, 16 (57.1%) and 12 (42.9%) were World Health Organization PS 0 and PS 1, respectively. At baseline, PS 1 patients had significantly worse global QoL functional and symptom scores at baseline. At 5 to 6 months' follow-up, PS 0 patients had no significant change in global QoL or functional domain scores. PS 1 patients had significant improvement in global QoL (p=0.038), symptoms of fatigue (p=0.05), and dyspnea (p=0.048). At 8 to 9 months' follow-up, PS 0 patients showed significant improvement in symptoms of fatigue (p=0.026) from baseline and PS 1 maintained the improvements in symptoms of fatigue (p=0.049) and dyspnea (p=0.048).

Sphingosine kinase 1 is required for mesothelioma cell proliferation: role of histone acetylation.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2012-09-17,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a devastating disease with an overall poor prognosis. Despite the recent advances in targeted molecular therapies, there is a clear and urgent need for the identification of novel mesothelioma targets for the development of highly efficacious therapeutics. In this study, we report that the expression of Sphingosine Kinase 1 (SphK1) protein was preferentially elevated in MPM tumor tissues (49 epithelioid and 13 sarcomatoid) compared to normal tissue (n = 13). In addition, we also observed significantly elevated levels of SphK1 and SphK2 mRNA and SphK1 protein expression in MPM cell lines such as H2691, H513 and H2461 compared to the non-malignant mesothelial Met5 cells. The underlying mechanism appears to be mediated by SphK1 induced upregulation of select gene transcription programs such as that of CBP/p300 and PCAF, two histone acetyl transferases (HAT), and the down regulation of cell cycle dependent kinase inhibitor genes such as p27Kip1 and p21Cip1. In addition, using immunoprecipitates of anti-acetylated histone antibody from SphK inhibitor, SphK-I2 treated Met5A and H2691 cell lysates, we also showed activation of other cell proliferation related genes, such as Top2A (DNA replication), AKB (chromosome remodeling and mitotic spindle formation), and suppression of p21 CIP1 and p27KIP1. The CDK2, HAT1 and MYST2 were, however, unaffected in the above study. Using SphK inhibitor and specific siRNA targeting either SphK1 or SphK2, we also unequivocally established that SphK1, but not SphK2, promotes H2691 mesothelioma cell proliferation. Using a multi-walled carbon nanotubes induced peritoneal mesothelioma mouse model, we showed that the SphK1-/- null mice exhibited significantly less inflammation and granulamatous nodules compared to their wild type counterparts.

Optimization of response classification criteria for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2012-11-01,"Response-assessment metrics play an important role in clinical trials and routine patient management. For patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), the standard for response assessment is image-based measurements of tumor thickness made according to the modified RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) protocol. To classify tumor response, changes in tumor thickness are compared with the standard RECIST -30% and +20% cutoffs for partial response (PR) and progressive disease (PD), respectively, which are not specific to MPM. The purpose of this work is to optimize the correlation between tumor response and patient survival by assessing the validity of existing response criteria in MPM and proposing alternative criteria. Computed tomography measurements of tumor thickness were acquired at baseline and throughout treatment for 78 patients undergoing standard-of-care chemotherapy. Overall survival was correlated with best response and first follow-up response using Harrell's C statistic. The response criteria for PD and PR were each varied in 1% increments to obtain optimized classification criteria. The performance was cross-validated using a leave-one-out approach. Median survival was 14.9 months. The performance of the standard RECIST criteria in correlating response with survival was C=0.778, whereas the optimized performance of C=0.855 was obtained with criteria of -64% for PR and +50% for PD.

Initial analyses focus on patients managed surgically. Participation was solicited from centers known to have MPM registries. Common data elements were analyzed by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer Staging Committee Statistical Center. Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method, prognostic factors by log rank and Cox regression model. p Value less than 0.05 was significant. Data included 3101 patients (15 centers, 4 continents). median age 63 years, 79% men, 62.3% epithelioid tumor. Best tumor, node, metastasis (bTNM) stages were: I (11%), II, (21%), III (48%), and IV (20%). Curative-intent surgery was performed in 1494 patients (64.5%). Median survivals by clinical TNM and pathological TNM were similar: stage I, 21 months; stage II, 19 months; stage III, 16 months; and stage IV, 12 months. Median survival by histology: epithelioid 19 months, biphasic 13 months, and sarcomatoid 8 months.

Three-dimensional stereoscopic volume rendering of malignant pleural mesothelioma.,International surgery,Int Surg,,"Our objective was to investigate the application of three-dimensional (3D) stereoscopic volume rendering with perceptual colorization on preoperative imaging for malignant pleural mesothelioma. At present, we have prospectively enrolled 6 patients being considered for resection of malignant pleural mesothelioma that have undergone a multidetector-row computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest. The CT data sets were volume rendered without preprocessing. The resultant 3D rendering was displayed stereoscopically and used to provide information regarding tumor extent, morphology, and anatomic involvement. To demonstrate this technique, this information was compared with the corresponding two-dimensional CT grayscale axial images from two of these patients. Three-dimensional stereoscopic reconstructions of the CT data sets provided detailed information regarding the local extent of tumor that could be used for preoperative surgical planning. Three-dimensional stereoscopic volume rendering for malignant pleural mesothelioma is a novel approach.

"New insights into understanding the mechanisms, pathogenesis, and management of malignant mesotheliomas.",The American journal of pathology,Am. J. Pathol.,2013-02-08,"Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a relatively rare but devastating tumor that is increasing worldwide. Yet, because of difficulties in early diagnosis and resistance to conventional therapies, MM remains a challenge for pathologists and clinicians to treat. In recent years, much has been revealed regarding the mechanisms of interactions of pathogenic fibers with mesothelial cells, crucial signaling pathways, and genetic and epigenetic events that may occur during the pathogenesis of these unusual, pleiomorphic tumors. These observations support a scenario whereby mesothelial cells undergo a series of chronic injury, inflammation, and proliferation in the long latency period of MM development that may be perpetuated by durable fibers, the tumor microenvironment, and inflammatory stimuli. One culprit in sustained inflammation is the activated inflammasome, a component of macrophages or mesothelial cells that leads to production of chemotactic, growth-promoting, and angiogenic cytokines.

Lung volume measurements as a surrogate marker for patient response in malignant pleural mesothelioma.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2013-04-01,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the continuous changes in three distinct response assessment methods during treatment as a marker of response for patients with mesothelioma. Linear tumor thickness measurements, disease volume measurements, and lung volume measurements (a physiological correlate of disease volumes) were investigated in this study. Serial computed tomography scans were obtained during the course of clinically standard chemotherapy for 61 patients. For each of the 216 computed tomography scans, the aerated lung volumes were segmented using a fully automated method, and the pleural disease volume was segmented using a semiautomated method. Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors linear-thickness measurements were acquired clinically. Diseased (ipsilateral) lung volumes were normalized by the respective contralateral lung volumes to account for the differences in inspiration between scans for each patient. Relative changes in each metric from baseline were tracked over the course of follow-up imaging. Survival modeling was performed using Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying covariates. Median survival from pretreatment baseline imaging was 12.7 months. A negative correlation was observed between measurements of lung volume and disease volume, and a positive correlation was observed between linear-thickness measurements and disease volume. As continuous numerical parameters, all three response assessment methods were significant imaging biomarkers of patient prognosis in independent survival models.

EphB4 as a therapeutic target in mesothelioma.,BMC cancer,BMC Cancer,2013-05-30,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) often develops decades following exposure to asbestos. Current best therapy produces a response in only half of patients, and the median survival with this therapy remains under a year. A search for novel targets and therapeutics is underway, and recently identified targets include VEGF, Notch, and EphB4-Ephrin-B2. Each of these targets has dual activity, promoting tumor cell growth as well as tumor angiogenesis. We investigated EphB4 expression in 39 human mesothelioma tissues by immunohistochemistry. Xenograft tumors established with human mesothelioma cells were treated with an EphB4 inhibitor (monomeric soluble EphB4 fused to human serum albumin, or sEphB4-HSA). The combinatorial effect of sEphB4-HSA and biologic agent was also studied. EphB4 was overexpressed in 72% of mesothelioma tissues evaluated, with 85% of epithelioid and 38% of sarcomatoid subtypes demonstrating overexpression. The EphB4 inhibitor sEphB4-HSA was highly active as a single agent to inhibit tumor growth, accompanied by tumor cell apoptosis and inhibition of PI3K and Src signaling. Combination of sEphB4-HSA and the anti-VEGF antibody (Bevacizumab) was superior to each agent alone and led to complete tumor regression. EphB4 is a potential therapeutic target in mesothelioma.

Variability of tumor area measurements for response assessment in malignant pleural mesothelioma.,Medical physics,Med Phys,2013-08-01,"The measurement of malignant pleural mesothelioma is critical to the assessment of tumor response to therapy. Current response assessment standards utilize summed linear measurements acquired on three computed tomography (CT) sections. The purpose of this study was to evaluate manual area measurements as an alternate response assessment metric, specifically through the study of measurement interobserver variability. Two CT scans from each of 31 patients were collected. Using a computer interface, five observers contoured tumor on three selected CT sections from each baseline scan. Four observers also constructed matched follow-up scan tumor contours for the same 31 patients. Area measurements extracted from these contours were compared using a random effects analysis of variance model to assess relative interobserver variability. The sums of section area measurements were also analyzed, since these area sums are more clinically relevant for response assessment. When each observer's measurements were compared with those of the other four observers, strong correlation was observed. The 95% confidence interval for relative interobserver variability of baseline scan summed area measurements was [-71%, +240%], spanning 311%. For the follow-up scan summed area measurements, the 95% confidence interval for relative interobserver variability was [-41%, +70%], spanning 111%. At both baseline and follow-up, the variability among observers was a significant component of the total variability in both per-section and summed area measurements (p<0.0001).

A contemporary analysis of morbidity and outcomes in cytoreduction/hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion.,Cancer medicine,Cancer Med,2013-04-16,"The risks and benefits of cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CS/HIPEC) continue to be debated by the oncology community. A retrospective analysis of contemporary data (2003-2011) was performed to provide objective information regarding surgical morbidity, mortality, and survival for patients undergoing CS/HIPEC at a comprehensive cancer center. While procedure-associated morbidity was comparable to other major surgical oncology procedures, there was no operative or 30-day mortality and 60-day mortality was 2.7%. Increasing numbers of bowel resections were found to correlate to an increased incidence of deep surgical site infections (including abscess and enterocutaneous fistula) and need for reoperation which was in turn associated with a decreased overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).

Sunitinib combined with pemetrexed and carboplatin in patients with advanced solid malignancies--results of a phase I dose-escalation study.,Investigational new drugs,Invest New Drugs,2013-08-22,"The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and overall safety of sunitinib plus pemetrexed and carboplatin was determined in patients with advanced solid malignancies. In this phase I dose-escalation study, patients received oral sunitinib on a continuous daily dosing (CDD) schedule (37.5 mg/day) or Schedule 2/1 (2 weeks on treatment, 1 week off treatment; 37.5 or 50 mg/day). Pemetrexed (400-500 mg/m(2) IV) and carboplatin (AUC = 5 mg·min/ml IV) were administered q3w. At the MTD for the chosen schedule, a cohort of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or mesothelioma was further evaluated. Twenty-one patients were enrolled on Schedule 2/1 (expansion cohort included) and 3 patients on the CDD schedule. The MTD on Schedule 2/1 was sunitinib 37.5 mg/day with pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) and carboplatin AUC = 5 mg·min/ml; MTD on the CDD schedule was not established. Dose-limiting toxicities included grade 3/4 neutropenia, grade 3 thrombocytopenia, and grade 3 hand-foot syndrome. The most common grade 3/4 drug-related non-hematologic adverse events at Schedule 2/1 MTD were fatigue/asthenia and diarrhea (both n = 4). Grade 3/4 hematologic abnormalities included neutropenia (83%) and leukopenia (83%). Pharmacokinetic data revealed no clinically significant drug-drug interactions. Best response at the Schedule 2/1 MTD was stable disease ≥8 weeks in 3/5 evaluable patients (60%). With this combination, in patients with advanced solid malignancies, sunitinib MTD on Schedule 2/1 was 37.5 mg/day.

Weekly nab-Rapamycin in patients with advanced nonhematologic malignancies: final results of a phase I trial.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2013-10-01,"This dose-finding phase I study investigated the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and safety of weekly nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin (nab-rapamycin) in patients with untreatable advanced nonhematologic malignancies. nab-Rapamycin was administered weekly for 3 weeks followed by 1 week of rest, with a starting dose of 45 mg/m(2). Additional doses were 56.25, 100, 150, and 125 mg/m(2). Of 27 enrolled patients, 26 were treated. Two dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) occurred at 150 mg/m(2) [grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation and grade 4 thrombocytopenia], and two DLTs occurred at 125 mg/m(2) (grade 3 suicidal ideation and grade 3 hypophosphatemia). Thus, the MTD was declared at 100 mg/m(2). Most treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) were grade 1/2, including thrombocytopenia (58%), hypokalemia (23%), mucositis (38%), fatigue (27%), rash (23%), diarrhea (23%), nausea (19%), anemia (19%), hypophosphatemia (19%), neutropenia (15%), and hypertriglyceridemia (15%). Only one grade 3 nonhematologic TRAE (dyspnea) and one grade 3 hematologic event (anemia) occurred at the MTD. One patient with kidney cancer had a partial response and 2 patients remained on study for 365 days (patient with mesothelioma) and 238 days (patient with neuroendocrine tumor). The peak concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of rapamycin increased with dose between 45 and 150 mg/m(2), except for a relatively low AUC at 125 mg/m(2). nab-Rapamycin significantly inhibited mTOR targets S6K and 4EBP1. The clinical dose of single-agent nab-rapamycin was established at 100 mg/m(2) weekly (3 of 4 weeks) given intravenously, which was well tolerated with preliminary evidence of response and stable disease, and produced a fairly dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile in patients with unresectable advanced nonhematologic malignancies.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",2303.0,27.0,This dose-finding phase I study investigated the maximum-tolerated dose MTD and safety of weekly nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin nab-rapamycin in patients with untreatable advanced nonhematologic malignancies nab-Rapamycin was administered weekly for 3 weeks followed by 1 week of rest with a starting dose of 45 mg/m 2 Additional doses were 56.25 100 150 and 125 mg/m 2 Of 27 enrolled patients 26 were treated Two dose-limiting toxicities DLT occurred at 150 mg/m 2 grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase AST elevation and grade 4 thrombocytopenia and two DLTs occurred at 125 mg/m 2 grade 3 suicidal ideation and grade 3 hypophosphatemia Thus the MTD was declared at 100 mg/m 2 Most treatment-related adverse events TRAE were grade 1/2 including thrombocytopenia 58 hypokalemia 23 mucositis 38 fatigue 27 rash 23 diarrhea 23 nausea 19 anemia 19 hypophosphatemia 19 neutropenia 15 and hypertriglyceridemia 15 Only one grade 3 nonhematologic TRAE dyspnea and one grade 3 hematologic event anemia occurred at the MTD One patient with cancer had a partial response and 2 patients remained on study for 365 days patient with and 238 days patient with neuroendocrine tumor The peak concentration Cmax and area under the concentration-time curve AUC of rapamycin increased with dose between 45 and 150 mg/m 2 except for a relatively low AUC at 125 mg/m 2 nab-Rapamycin significantly inhibited mTOR targets S6K and 4EBP1 The clinical dose of single-agent nab-rapamycin was established at 100 mg/m 2 weekly 3 of 4 weeks given intravenously which was well tolerated with preliminary evidence of response and stable disease and produced a fairly dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile in patients with unresectable advanced nonhematologic malignancies,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[26, 61, 1567, 124, 70, 45, 565, 3, 689, 421, 61, 961, 2, 367, 1, 709, 4483, 2799, 2951, 1620, 3139, 1620, 4, 7, 5, 20322, 131, 3534, 441, 3139, 1620, 10, 468, 709, 9, 27, 244, 370, 20, 14, 647, 1, 3677, 5, 8, 1723, 61, 1, 512, 81, 188, 18, 402, 415, 11, 664, 243, 394, 1577, 2, 1731, 81, 188, 18, 1, 428, 346, 7, 432, 11, 73, 100, 61, 817, 385, 2059, 489, 28, 1577, 81, 188, 18, 88, 27, 6308, 4597, 5759, 3292, 2, 88, 39, 1340, 2, 100, 2506, 489, 28, 1731, 81, 188, 18, 88, 27, 13969, 13652, 2, 88, 27, 8021, 631, 3, 961, 10, 11750, 28, 394, 81, 188, 18, 96, 24, 139, 290, 281, 29487, 11, 88, 14, 18, 141, 1340, 717, 7799, 382, 2606, 519, 613, 428, 1641, 382, 1172, 382, 1218, 326, 1545, 326, 8021, 326, 778, 167, 2, 10427, 167, 158, 104, 88, 27, 3534, 29487, 2923, 2, 104, 88, 27, 813, 774, 1545, 489, 28, 3, 961, 104, 69, 5, 12, 42, 8, 450, 51, 2, 18, 7, 958, 23, 45, 9, 7405, 162, 69, 5, 2, 6883, 162, 69, 5, 1542, 30, 3, 2944, 1227, 9818, 2, 965, 669, 3, 1227, 98, 1496, 1376, 1, 1620, 101, 5, 61, 59, 512, 2, 1577, 81, 188, 18, 2187, 9, 8, 1352, 154, 1376, 28, 1731, 81, 188, 18, 3139, 1620, 97, 879, 873, 637, 10093, 2, 10908, 3, 38, 61, 1, 226, 420, 3139, 1620, 10, 635, 28, 394, 81, 188, 18, 709, 27, 1, 39, 244, 447, 1672, 92, 10, 149, 421, 5, 1676, 241, 1, 51, 2, 585, 34, 2, 1687, 8, 9971, 61, 831, 1456, 800, 4, 7, 5, 1468, 131, 3534, 441]",1746.0,24089446,183
Clinical characteristics of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma harboring somatic BAP1 mutations.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2013-11-01,"Genomic studies of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) have recently identified frequent mutations in the BRCA-associated protein 1(BAP1) gene. In uveal melanoma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma, BAP1 mutations are associated with poor outcomes but their clinical significance in MPM is unknown. We therefore undertook this study to define the characteristics of patients whose MPM tumors harbor somatic BAP1 mutation and to examine the relationship between BAP1 mutation and survival. We reviewed the charts of 121 patients with MPM tumors diagnosed between 1991 and 2009 tested for BAP1 mutation, and extracted the following information: age at diagnosis, sex, histology, stage, smoking status, asbestos exposure, family or personal history of malignancy, and treatment including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation as well as survival status. Twenty-four of the 121 tumors (20%) harbored somatic BAP1 mutations. The percentage of current or former smokers among cases with BAP1 mutations was significantly higher than in BAP1 wild-type cases, (75% versus 42%; p = 0.006). However, the types of nucleotide substitutions in BAP1 did not suggest that this association was because of a causative role of smoking in BAP1 mutations. No other clinical feature was significantly different among those with and without BAP1 mutations in their MPM. There was also no difference in survival according to somatic BAP1 mutation status. There is no apparent distinct clinical phenotype for MPM with somatic BAP1 mutation.

"Phase I trial of cisplatin, pemetrexed, and imatinib mesylate in chemonaive patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma.",Clinical lung cancer,Clin Lung Cancer,2013-12-27,"We conducted a phase I trial of cisplatin/pemetrexed/imatinib mesylate, an oral platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) inhibitor, in chemonaive patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). A standard 3 + 3 dose-escalating trial was used with the end points of maximum tolerated dose (MTD), response rate, survival, safety/toxicity, and tumor PDGFR levels. Seventeen patients with MPM were enrolled. The most common (any grade) side effects were nausea, fatigue, hypomagnesemia, and anemia. The MTD was established at dose level 3 (imatinib 600 mg) with a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of nausea and vomiting. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.9 months and the median overall survival (OS) was 8.8 months. Patients with a sarcomatoid subtype had worse PFS (P = .01) and OS (P = .009), whereas they had a better Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0-1 predicted for improved OS (P = .001) and PFS (P = .013). The 6 patients who completed all 6 treatment cycles had better OS (P = .006); the median PFS was 9.6 months and the OS was 22.4 months. In the translational studies, 14 patients had adequate tumor tissue that could be assessed for immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Patients with higher than median p-PDGFRα IHC expression had a better OS (P = .013). When assessed as a continuous variable, higher p-PDGFRα in tumor cells correlated with an improved OS (P = .045). None of the other 4 IHC biomarkers were predictive or prognostic for survival. Twelve patients had successful PDGFRB FISH results, but none met the criteria of ≥ 4 copies of the PDGFRB gene; thus a correlation with clinical outcomes could not be done. The cisplatin/pemetrexed/imatinib mesylate combination had clinical benefit in some patients with MPM but was not well tolerated. Further investigation into alternative antiangiogenic agents, including PDGFRα inhibitors, is warranted.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",2216.0,16.0,We conducted a phase I trial of cisplatin/pemetrexed/imatinib mesylate an oral platelet-derived growth factor receptor PDGFR inhibitor in chemonaive patients with malignant pleural MPM A standard 3 3 dose-escalating trial was used with the end points of maximum tolerated dose MTD response rate survival safety/toxicity and tumor PDGFR levels Seventeen patients with MPM were enrolled The most common any grade side effects were nausea fatigue hypomagnesemia and anemia The MTD was established at dose level 3 imatinib 600 mg with a dose-limiting toxicity DLT of nausea and vomiting The median progression-free survival PFS was 7.9 months and the median overall survival OS was 8.8 months Patients with a sarcomatoid subtype had worse PFS P .01 and OS P .009 whereas they had a better Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ECOG PS of 0-1 predicted for improved OS P .001 and PFS P .013 The 6 patients who completed all 6 treatment cycles had better OS P .006 the median PFS was 9.6 months and the OS was 22.4 months In the translational studies 14 patients had adequate tumor tissue that could be assessed for immunohistochemical IHC analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH Patients with higher than median p-PDGFRα IHC expression had a better OS P .013 When assessed as a continuous variable higher p-PDGFRα in tumor cells correlated with an improved OS P .045 None of the other 4 IHC biomarkers were predictive or prognostic for survival Twelve patients had successful PDGFRB FISH results but none met the criteria of ≥ 4 copies of the PDGFRB gene thus a correlation with clinical outcomes could not be done The cisplatin/pemetrexed/imatinib mesylate combination had clinical benefit in some patients with MPM but was not well tolerated Further investigation into alternative antiangiogenic agents including PDGFRα inhibitors is warranted,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 426, 8, 124, 70, 160, 1, 540, 2046, 577, 2347, 35, 518, 1596, 526, 129, 161, 153, 4103, 230, 4, 14503, 7, 5, 393, 2164, 3278, 8, 260, 27, 27, 61, 2922, 160, 10, 95, 5, 3, 396, 862, 1, 689, 421, 61, 961, 51, 116, 25, 367, 155, 2, 30, 4103, 148, 3591, 7, 5, 3278, 11, 346, 3, 96, 186, 500, 88, 1152, 176, 11, 1218, 613, 10746, 2, 1545, 3, 961, 10, 635, 28, 61, 301, 27, 577, 2383, 81, 5, 8, 61, 817, 155, 2059, 1, 1218, 2, 1966, 3, 52, 91, 115, 25, 300, 10, 67, 83, 53, 2, 3, 52, 63, 25, 118, 10, 66, 66, 53, 7, 5, 8, 3912, 875, 42, 639, 300, 19, 355, 2, 118, 19, 2376, 547, 491, 42, 8, 380, 2118, 1690, 413, 87, 528, 156, 2351, 1511, 1, 13, 14, 783, 9, 231, 118, 19, 144, 2, 300, 19, 3612, 3, 49, 7, 54, 781, 62, 49, 24, 410, 42, 380, 118, 19, 1861, 3, 52, 300, 10, 83, 49, 53, 2, 3, 118, 10, 350, 39, 53, 4, 3, 2460, 94, 213, 7, 42, 1658, 30, 246, 17, 359, 40, 275, 9, 1382, 1289, 65, 2, 1591, 4, 957, 1554, 1277, 7, 5, 142, 76, 52, 19, 7458, 1289, 55, 42, 8, 380, 118, 19, 3612, 198, 275, 22, 8, 1314, 1347, 142, 19, 7458, 4, 30, 37, 438, 5, 35, 231, 118, 19, 4918, 1292, 1, 3, 127, 39, 1289, 582, 11, 464, 15, 177, 9, 25, 2544, 7, 42, 1401, 10231, 1277, 99, 84, 1292, 543, 3, 371, 1, 749, 39, 5127, 1, 3, 10231, 145, 631, 8, 816, 5, 38, 123, 359, 44, 40, 1822, 3, 540, 2046, 577, 2347, 150, 42, 38, 247, 4, 476, 7, 5, 3278, 84, 10, 44, 149, 421, 195, 940, 237, 1091, 2168, 183, 141, 7458, 222, 16, 1197]",1869.0,24492162,124
Elevated PDGFRB gene copy number gain is prognostic for improved survival outcomes in resected malignant pleural mesothelioma.,Annals of diagnostic pathology,Ann Diagn Pathol,2014-02-20,"PDGF/PDGFR pathway has been implicated in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) carcinogenesis, and evidence suggests autocrine mechanisms of proliferation. We sought to evaluate the incidence of PDGFRB gene copy number gain (CNG) by fluorescence in situ hybridization and PDGFR pathway protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and correlate it to patient clinical outcome. Eighty-eight archived tumor blocks from resected MPM with full clinical information were used to perform IHC biomarkers (PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, p-PDGFRβ) and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of PDGFRB gene CNG. Spearman rank correlation, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Kruskal-Wallis test, BLiP plots, and Kaplan-Meier method were used to analyze the biomarkers and correlation to clinical outcome. Several correlations between the IHC biomarkers were seen; however, none correlated to clinically relevant patient demographics or histology. In the CNG analysis, PDGFRB gene CNG in >10% of tumor cells had lower cytoplasmic p-PDGFRβ (P=.029), while PDGFRB gene CNG in >40% of tumor cells had a higher cytoplasmic PDGFRβ (P=.04). PDGFRB gene CNG status did not associate with patient demographics or tumor characteristics. PDGFR pathway IHC biomarkers did not associate with survival outcomes. However, patients with PDGFRB CNG >40% of tumor cells had improved relapse-free survival (HR 0.25 [95% CI 0.09-0.72], P=.0096) and improved overall survival (HR 0.32 [95% CI 0.11-0.89], P=.029). PDGFRB CNG >40% of MPM tumor cells is a potential prognostic biomarker for surgery and may identify a unique population of mesothelioma patients. Future validation of this biomarker in prospective trials is needed. From a retrospective review of archived tissue specimens from patients with resected malignant pleural mesothelioma tumors, we show that patients with PDGFRB CNG >40% of tumor cells had improved relapse-free survival (HR 0.25 [95% CI 0.09-0.72], P=.0096) and improved overall survival (HR 0.32 [95% CI 0.11-0.89], P=.029).

Supplementary prognostic variables for pleural mesothelioma: a report from the IASLC staging committee.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2014-06-01,"The staging system for malignant pleural mesothelioma is controversial. To revise this system, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer Staging Committee developed an international database. This report analyzes prognostic variables in a surgical population, which are supplementary to previously published CORE variables (stage, histology, sex, age, and type of procedure). Supplementary prognostic variables were studied in three scenarios: (1) all data available, that is, patient pathologically staged and other CORE variables available (2) only clinical staging available along with CORE variables, and (3) only age, sex, histology, and laboratory parameters are known. Survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier, prognostic factors by log rank and stepwise Cox regression modeling after elimination of nonsignificant variables. p value less than 0.05 was significant. A total of 2141 patients with best tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) stages (pathologic with/without clinical staging) had nonmissing age, sex, histology, and type of surgical procedure. Three prognostic models were defined. Scenario A (all parameters): best pathologic stage, histology, sex, age, type of surgery, adjuvant treatment, white blood cell count (WBC) (≥15.5 or not), and platelets (≥400 k or not) (n = 550).

Therapeutic efficacy of an Fc-enhanced TCR-like antibody to the intracellular WT1 oncoprotein.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2014-05-21,"RMFPNAPYL (RMF), a Wilms' tumor gene 1 (WT1)-derived CD8 T-cell epitope presented by HLA-A*02:01, is a validated target for T-cell-based immunotherapy. We previously reported ESK1, a high avidity (Kd < 0.2 nmol/L), fully-human monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for the WT1 RMF peptide/HLA-A*02:01 complex, which selectively bound and killed WT1(+) and HLA-A*02:01(+) leukemia and solid tumor cell lines. We engineered a second-generation mAb, ESKM, to have enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) function due to altered Fc glycosylation. ESKM was compared with native ESK1 in binding assays, in vitro ADCC assays, and mesothelioma and leukemia therapeutic models and pharmacokinetic studies in mice. ESKM toxicity was assessed in HLA-A*02:01(+) transgenic mice. ESK antibodies mediated ADCC against hematopoietic and solid tumor cells at concentrations below 1 μg/mL, but ESKM was about 5- to 10-fold more potent in vitro against multiple cancer cell lines. ESKM was more potent in vivo against JMN mesothelioma, and effective against SET2 AML and fresh ALL xenografts. ESKM had a shortened half-life (4.9 days vs. 6.5 days), but an identical biodistribution pattern in C57BL/6J mice. At therapeutic doses of ESKM, there was no difference in half-life or biodistribution in HLA-A*02:01(+) transgenic mice compared with the parent strain. Importantly, therapeutic doses of ESKM in these mice caused no depletion of total WBCs or hematopoetic stem cells, or pathologic tissue damage.

Current issues in malignant pleural mesothelioma evaluation and management.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2014-07-24,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an uncommon disease most often associated with occupational asbestos exposure and is steadily increasing in worldwide incidence. Patients typically present at an older age, with advanced clinical stage and other medical comorbidities, making management quite challenging. Despite great efforts, the prognosis of MPM remains poor, especially at progression after initial treatment. Macroscopic complete resection of MPM can be achieved through extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) or extended (ie, radical) pleurectomy (e-P/D) in selected patients and can result in prolonged survival when incorporated into a multimodality approach. Given the morbidity associated with surgical resection of MPM, optimizing identification of appropriate patients is essential. Unfortunately, most patients are not candidates for EPP or e-P/D due to advanced stage, age, and/or medical comorbidity. Pemetrexed and platinum combination chemotherapy has become the cornerstone of therapy for patients with unresectable disease because the combination is associated with improved survival and quality of life in treated patients. However, MPM eventually becomes resistant to initial therapy, and benefit to further lines of therapy has not been substantiated in randomized clinical trials. Translational research has provided exciting insights into tumorigenesis, biomarkers, and immune response in MPM, leading to the development of multiple novel therapeutic agents that are currently in clinical trials. These advances hold the promise of a new era in the treatment of MPM and suggest that this disease will not be left behind in the war on cancer.

Failure patterns after hemithoracic pleural intensity modulated radiation therapy for malignant pleural mesothelioma.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2014-07-26,"We previously reported our technique for delivering intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to the entire pleura while attempting to spare the lung in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Herein, we report a detailed pattern-of-failure analysis in patients with MPM who were unresectable or underwent pleurectomy/decortication (P/D), uniformly treated with hemithoracic pleural IMRT. Sixty-seven patients with MPM were treated with definitive or adjuvant hemithoracic pleural IMRT between November 2004 and May 2013. Pretreatment imaging, treatment plans, and posttreatment imaging were retrospectively reviewed to determine failure location(s). Failures were categorized as in-field (within the 90% isodose line), marginal (<90% and ≥50% isodose lines), out-of-field (outside the 50% isodose line), or distant. The median follow-up was 24 months from diagnosis and the median time to in-field local failure from the end of RT was 10 months. Forty-three in-field local failures (64%) were found with a 1- and 2-year actuarial failure rate of 56% and 74%, respectively. For patients who underwent P/D versus those who received a partial pleurectomy or were deemed unresectable, the median time to in-field local failure was 14 months versus 6 months, respectively, with 1- and 2-year actuarial in-field local failure rates of 43% and 60% versus 66% and 83%, respectively (P=.03). There were 13 marginal failures (19%). Five of the marginal failures (38%) were located within the costomediastinal recess. Marginal failures decreased with increasing institutional experience (P=.04). Twenty-five patients (37%) had out-of-field failures. Distant failures occurred in 32 patients (48%).

Low PIAS3 expression in malignant mesothelioma is associated with increased STAT3 activation and poor patient survival.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2014-08-14,"Deregulation of STAT3 activation is a hallmark of many cancer cells, and the underlying mechanisms are subject to intense investigation. We examined the extent of PIAS3 expression in mesothelioma cells and human tumor samples and determined the functional effects of PIAS3 expression on STAT3 signaling. We evaluated the expression of PIAS3 in mesothelioma tumors from patients and correlated the expression levels with the course of the disease. We also measured the effects of enhanced PIAS3 activity on STAT3 signaling, cellular growth, and viability in cultured mesothelioma cells. Gene expression databases revealed that mesotheliomas have the lowest levels of PIAS3 transcripts among solid tumors. PIAS3 expression in human mesothelioma tumors is significantly correlated with overall survival intervals (P = 0.058). The high expression of PIAS3 is predictive of a favorable prognosis and decreases the probability of death within one year after diagnosis by 44%. PIAS3 expression is functionally linked to STAT3 activation in mesothelioma cell lines. STAT3 downregulation with siRNA or enhanced expression of PIAS3 both inhibited mesothelioma cell growth and induced apoptosis. Mesothelioma cells are sensitive to curcumin and respond by the induction of PIAS3. Corroborative evidence has been obtained from STAT3 inhibition experiments. Exposure of the cells to a peptide derived from the PIAS3 protein that interferes with STAT3 function resulted in apoptosis induction and the inhibition of cell growth. These results suggest that PIAS3 protein expression impacts survival in patients with mesothelioma and that PIAS3 activation could become a therapeutic strategy.

Thirty-day mortality underestimates the risk of early death after major resections for thoracic malignancies.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2014-09-08,"Operative mortality rates are of great interest to surgeons, patients, policy makers, and payers as a metric for quality assessment. Thirty-day mortality and discharge mortality have been presumed to capture procedure-related deaths. However, many patients die after the 30-day mark or are transferred to other facilities or to home and die there, leading to the underreporting of surgically related deaths. We hypothesized that a longer period of observation would address these concerns and provide a more accurate measure of operative mortality. We retrospectively reviewed institutional databases of patients undergoing resection for lung cancer, esophageal cancer, and mesothelioma. Mortality rates at 30 and 90 days were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). From 1999 to 2012, 7,646 surgical resections were performed: 6,119 for lung cancer, 1,258 for esophageal cancer, and 269 for mesothelioma. Among the different cancers and across operations, the additional mortality from day 31 to 90 (1.4%; 95% CI, 1.2% to 1.8%; n=111) was similar to that by day 30 (1.2%; 95% CI, 1.0% to 1.5%; n=95), resulting in overall 90-day mortality (2.7%; 95% CI, 2.3% to 3.1%; n=206) that was more than double the 30-day mortality. Among patients who have undergone operations for thoracic malignancies, mortality attributable to the operation occurs beyond the first 30 postsurgical days as well as after hospital discharge. Because cancer operations constitute a large portion of general thoracic surgery, we recommend national databases consider the inclusion of 90-day mortality in their data collection.",Comparative Study,1961.0,35.0,"Operative mortality rates are of great interest to surgeons patients policy makers and payers as a metric for quality assessment Thirty-day mortality and discharge mortality have been presumed to capture procedure-related deaths However many patients die after the 30-day mark or are transferred to other facilities or to home and die there leading to the underreporting of surgically related deaths We hypothesized that a longer period of observation would address these concerns and provide a more accurate measure of operative mortality We retrospectively reviewed institutional databases of patients undergoing resection for cancer cancer and Mortality rates at 30 and 90 days were calculated with 95 confidence intervals CIs From 1999 to 2012 7,646 surgical resections were performed 6,119 for cancer 1,258 for cancer and 269 for Among the different cancers and across operations the additional mortality from day 31 to 90 1.4 95 CI 1.2 to 1.8 n=111 was similar to that by day 30 1.2 95 CI 1.0 to 1.5 n=95 resulting in overall 90-day mortality 2.7 95 CI 2.3 to 3.1 n=206 that was more than double the 30-day mortality Among patients who have undergone operations for thoracic malignancies mortality attributable to the operation occurs beyond the first 30 postsurgical days as well as after hospital discharge Because cancer operations constitute a large portion of general thoracic surgery we recommend national databases consider the inclusion of 90-day mortality in their data collection",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[1208, 282, 151, 32, 1, 2797, 1333, 6, 1613, 7, 4196, 10888, 2, 9361, 22, 8, 6515, 9, 372, 455, 977, 218, 282, 2, 2993, 282, 47, 85, 5472, 6, 2891, 1299, 139, 1043, 137, 445, 7, 3384, 50, 3, 201, 218, 8863, 15, 32, 4747, 6, 127, 4351, 15, 6, 3249, 2, 3384, 125, 1049, 6, 3, 25408, 1, 2350, 139, 1043, 21, 1237, 17, 8, 589, 727, 1, 1664, 688, 1539, 46, 2061, 2, 377, 8, 80, 1481, 1463, 1, 1208, 282, 21, 894, 446, 1115, 2348, 1, 7, 479, 170, 9, 12, 12, 2, 282, 151, 28, 201, 2, 424, 162, 11, 981, 5, 48, 307, 1582, 1927, 29, 2043, 6, 1195, 67, 14458, 221, 2185, 11, 173, 49, 4299, 9, 12, 14, 8289, 9, 12, 2, 8639, 9, 107, 3, 338, 163, 2, 716, 3867, 3, 402, 282, 29, 218, 456, 6, 424, 14, 39, 48, 58, 14, 18, 6, 14, 66, 78, 3167, 10, 288, 6, 17, 20, 218, 201, 14, 18, 48, 58, 14, 13, 6, 14, 33, 78, 48, 1113, 4, 63, 424, 218, 282, 18, 67, 48, 58, 18, 27, 6, 27, 14, 78, 5956, 17, 10, 80, 76, 1627, 3, 201, 218, 282, 107, 7, 54, 47, 1989, 3867, 9, 2098, 441, 282, 2971, 6, 3, 2589, 1780, 1654, 3, 157, 201, 6891, 162, 22, 149, 22, 50, 702, 2993, 408, 12, 3867, 4999, 8, 375, 3206, 1, 1083, 2098, 152, 21, 2237, 657, 2348, 2419, 3, 1680, 1, 424, 218, 282, 4, 136, 74, 2442]",1495.0,25200731,55
Advances in the management of peritoneal mesothelioma.,World journal of gastroenterology,World J. Gastroenterol.,2014-09-01,"Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (PM) is an infrequent disease which has historically been associated with a poor prognosis. Given its long latency period and non-specific symptomatology, a diagnosis of PM can be suggested by occupational exposure history, but ultimately relies heavily on imaging and diagnostic biopsy. Early treatment options including palliative operative debulking, intraperitoneal chemotherapy, and systemic chemotherapy have marginally improved the natural course of the disease with median survival being approximately one year. The advent of cytoreduction (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has dramatically improved survival outcomes with wide median survival estimates between 2.5 to 9 years; these studies however remain largely heterogeneous, with differing study populations, tumor biology, and specific treatment regimens. More recent investigations have explored extent of cytoreduction, repeated operative intervention, and choice of chemotherapy but have been unable to offer definitive conclusions. CRS and HIPEC remain morbid procedures with complication rates ranging between 30% to 46% in larger series. Accordingly, an increasing interest in identifying molecular targets and developing targeted therapies is emerging. Among such novel targets is sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) which regulates the production of sphingosine-1-phosphate, a biologically active lipid implicated in various cancers including malignant mesothelioma.

MET and PI3K/mTOR as a potential combinatorial therapeutic target in malignant pleural mesothelioma.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2014-09-15,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive disease with a poor prognosis. Studies have shown that both MET and its key downstream intracellular signaling partners, PI3K and mTOR, are overexpressed in MPM. Here we determined the combinatorial therapeutic efficacy of a new generation small molecule inhibitor of MET, ARQ 197, and dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors NVP-BEZ235 and GDC-0980 in mesothelioma cell and mouse xenograft models. Cell viability results show that mesothelioma cell lines were sensitive to ARQ 197, NVP-BEZ235 and GDC-0980 inhibitors. The combined use of ARQ 197 with either NVP-BEZ235 or GDC-0980, was synergistic (CI<1). Significant delay in wound healing was observed with ARQ 197 (p<0.001) with no added advantage of combining it with either NVP-BEZ235 or GDC-0980. ARQ 197 alone mainly induced apoptosis (20±2.36%) that was preceded by suppression of MAPK activity, while all the three suppressed cell cycle progression. Both GDC-0980 and NVP-BEZ235 strongly inhibited activities of PI3K and mTOR as evidenced from the phosphorylation status of AKT and S6 kinase. The above observation was further substantiated by the finding that a majority of the MPM archival samples tested revealed highly active AKT. While the single use of ARQ 197 and GDC-0980 inhibited significantly the growth of MPM xenografts (p<0.05, p<0.001 respectively) in mice, the combination of the above two drugs was highly synergistic (p<0.001). Our results suggest that the combined use of ARQ 197/NVP-BEZ235 and ARQ 197/GDC-0980 is far more effective than the use of the drugs singly in suppressing MPM tumor growth and motility and therefore merit further translational studies.

"Phase II clinical trial of amatuximab, a chimeric antimesothelin antibody with pemetrexed and cisplatin in advanced unresectable pleural mesothelioma.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2014-09-17,"Amatuximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody to mesothelin, a cell surface glycoprotein highly expressed in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). On the basis of its synergy with chemotherapy in preclinical studies, we evaluated the antitumor activity of amatuximab plus pemetrexed and cisplatin in patients with unresectable MPM. In a single-arm phase II study, amatuximab (5 mg/kg) was administered on days 1 and 8 with pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2)) and cisplatin (75 mg/m(2)) on day 1 of 21-day cycles for up to six cycles. Patients with response or stable disease received amatuximab maintenance until disease progression. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months. Secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), response rate, and safety. Eighty-nine patients were enrolled at 26 centers. Median of five cycles (range, 1-6) of combination treatment was administered, and 56 (63%) patients received amatuximab maintenance. Combination therapy resulted in no overlapping toxicities. Eleven patients (12.4%) had amatuximab-related hypersensitivity reactions. Responses included partial responses in 33 (40%) and stable disease in 42 (51%). Six-month PFS rate was 51% [95% confidence interval (CI), 39.1-62.3)], median PFS was 6.1 months (95% CI, 5.8-6.4), and median OS was 14.8 months (95% CI, 12.4-18.5) with 29 patients alive at data cut-off. Amatuximab with pemetrexed and cisplatin was well tolerated with objective tumor response or stable disease rate of 90% by independent radiologic review. Although PFS was not significantly different from historical controls, the median OS was 14.8 months with a third of patients alive and 5 continuing to receive amatuximab at the time of analysis.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",1952.0,80.0,Amatuximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody to mesothelin a cell surface glycoprotein highly expressed in malignant pleural MPM On the basis of its synergy with chemotherapy in preclinical studies we evaluated the antitumor activity of amatuximab plus pemetrexed and cisplatin in patients with unresectable MPM In a single-arm phase II study amatuximab 5 mg/kg was administered on days 1 and 8 with pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 on day 1 of 21-day cycles for up to six cycles Patients with response or stable disease received amatuximab maintenance until disease progression Primary endpoint was progression-free survival PFS at 6 months Secondary endpoints were overall survival OS response rate and safety Eighty-nine patients were enrolled at 26 centers Median of five cycles range 1-6 of combination treatment was administered and 56 63 patients received amatuximab maintenance Combination therapy resulted in no overlapping toxicities Eleven patients 12.4 had amatuximab-related hypersensitivity reactions Responses included partial responses in 33 40 and stable disease in 42 51 Six-month PFS rate was 51 95 confidence interval CI 39.1-62.3 median PFS was 6.1 months 95 CI 5.8-6.4 and median OS was 14.8 months 95 CI 12.4-18.5 with 29 patients alive at data cut-off Amatuximab with pemetrexed and cisplatin was well tolerated with objective tumor response or stable disease rate of 90 by independent radiologic review Although PFS was not significantly different from historical controls the median OS was 14.8 months with a third of patients alive and 5 continuing to receive amatuximab at the time of analysis,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[22862, 16, 8, 2897, 848, 548, 6, 5402, 8, 31, 1255, 4455, 561, 570, 4, 393, 2164, 3278, 23, 3, 877, 1, 211, 3439, 5, 56, 4, 693, 94, 21, 194, 3, 579, 128, 1, 22862, 349, 2046, 2, 540, 4, 7, 5, 1468, 3278, 4, 8, 226, 475, 124, 215, 45, 22862, 33, 81, 503, 10, 468, 23, 162, 14, 2, 66, 5, 2046, 1666, 81, 188, 18, 2, 540, 481, 81, 188, 18, 23, 218, 14, 1, 239, 218, 410, 9, 126, 6, 437, 410, 7, 5, 51, 15, 585, 34, 103, 22862, 1146, 1100, 34, 91, 86, 1138, 10, 91, 115, 25, 300, 28, 49, 53, 568, 1387, 11, 63, 25, 118, 51, 116, 2, 367, 2207, 762, 7, 11, 346, 28, 432, 1168, 52, 1, 365, 410, 184, 14, 49, 1, 150, 24, 10, 468, 2, 664, 676, 7, 103, 22862, 1146, 150, 36, 627, 4, 77, 4551, 385, 2627, 7, 133, 39, 42, 22862, 139, 4034, 2428, 253, 159, 450, 253, 4, 466, 327, 2, 585, 34, 4, 595, 725, 437, 811, 300, 116, 10, 725, 48, 307, 268, 58, 587, 14, 744, 27, 52, 300, 10, 49, 14, 53, 48, 58, 33, 66, 49, 39, 2, 52, 118, 10, 213, 66, 53, 48, 58, 133, 39, 203, 33, 5, 462, 7, 1701, 28, 74, 3554, 1889, 22862, 5, 2046, 2, 540, 10, 149, 421, 5, 461, 30, 51, 15, 585, 34, 116, 1, 424, 20, 306, 2812, 206, 242, 300, 10, 44, 97, 338, 29, 2252, 535, 3, 52, 118, 10, 213, 66, 53, 5, 8, 1282, 1, 7, 1701, 2, 33, 4346, 6, 560, 22862, 28, 3, 98, 1, 65]",1634.0,25231400,101

Recent clinical trials have improved our understanding of the biology of MPM. However, survival results are still not ideal. For early-stage MPM, patients should be evaluated for trimodality therapy in an experienced cancer center. If treating off-protocol, MPM patients should receive a surgical staging evaluation. The decision to proceed with surgical resection also should be considered after an extensive and thorough pulmonary and cardiac evaluation. If deemed a good surgical candidate, patients should receive surgical resection (pleurectomy/decortication or extrapleural pneumonectomy), adjuvant radiation therapy (hemithoracic external beam or intensity modulated radiation therapy), and either neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin-pemetrexed for 4 cycles). The optimal precise sequence of the trimodality is unclear and should be decided upon by a multidisciplinary consensus for each individual patient. In general, clinical trial participation should be encouraged. Several trials are currently underway to examine intraoperative therapies, vaccines, immunotherapy additions, and novel radiation therapy techniques.

"Hemithoracic intensity modulated radiation therapy after pleurectomy/decortication for malignant pleural mesothelioma: toxicity, patterns of failure, and a matched survival analysis.","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2014-10-25,"To investigate safety, efficacy, and recurrence after hemithoracic intensity modulated radiation therapy after pleurectomy/decortication (PD-IMRT) and after extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP-IMRT). In 2009-2013, 24 patients with mesothelioma underwent PD-IMRT to the involved hemithorax to a dose of 45 Gy, with an optional integrated boost; 22 also received chemotherapy. Toxicity was scored with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0. Pulmonary function was compared at baseline, after surgery, and after IMRT. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), time to locoregional failure, and time to distant metastasis. Failures were in-field, marginal, or out of field. Outcomes were compared with those of 24 patients, matched for age, nodal status, performance status, and chemotherapy, who had received EPP-IMRT. Median follow-up time was 12.2 months. Grade 3 toxicity rates were 8% skin and 8% pulmonary. Pulmonary function declined from baseline to after surgery (by 21% for forced vital capacity, 16% for forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and 19% for lung diffusion of carbon monoxide [P for all = .01]) and declined still further after IMRT (by 31% for forced vital capacity [P=.02], 25% for forced expiratory volume in 1 second [P=.01], and 30% for lung diffusion of carbon monoxide [P=.01]). The OS and PFS rates were 76% and 67%, respectively, at 1 year and 56% and 34% at 2 years.

CD30 is a potential therapeutic target in malignant mesothelioma.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2015-01-14,"CD30 is a cytokine receptor belonging to the TNF superfamily (TNFRSF8) that acts as a regulator of apoptosis. The presence of CD30 antigen is important in the diagnosis of Hodgkin disease and anaplastic large cell lymphoma. There have been sporadic reports of CD30 expression in nonlymphoid tumors, including malignant mesothelioma. Given the remarkable success of brentuximab vedotin, an antibody-drug conjugate directed against CD30 antigen, in lymphoid malignancies, we undertook a study to examine the incidence of CD30 in mesothelioma and to investigate the ability to target CD30 antigen in mesothelioma. Mesothelioma tumor specimens (N = 83) were examined for CD30 expression by IHC. Positive CD30 expression was noted in 13 mesothelioma specimens, primarily those of epithelial histology. There was no significant correlation of CD30 positivity with tumor grade, stage, or survival. Examination of four mesothelioma cell lines (H28, H2052, H2452, and 211H) for CD30 expression by both FACS analysis and confocal microscopy showed that CD30 antigen localized to the cell membrane. Brentuximab vedotin treatment of cultured mesothelioma cells produced a dose-dependent decrease in cell growth and viability at clinically relevant concentrations.

Oncol.,2015-01-22,"Currently, tumor-node-metastasis stage and histologic type are the established prognostic factors for malignant pleural mesothelioma, whereas no prognostic markers have been established for clinical practice. We investigated the prognostic value of CD10, a metalloproteinase that can promote cancer aggressiveness through enzymatic degradation and intracellular signaling crosstalk, in malignant pleural mesothelioma. CD10 immunostaining was performed for 176 cases of malignant pleural mesothelioma (epithelioid, 148; biphasic, 14; sarcomatoid, 14), and its expression was dichotomized as negative (no staining) or positive (any staining). Epithelioid tumors were classified as pleomorphic subtype when cytologic pleomorphism was ≥10 % of the tumor. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed by log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazard models. Tumoral CD10 expression was identified in 42 % of epithelioid non-pleomorphic tumors, 57 % of epithelioid pleomorphic tumors, 79 % of biphasic tumors, and 93 % of sarcomatoid tumors (p < 0.001). Positive CD10 expression was correlated with higher mitotic count (p = 0.002). Overall survival for patients with positive CD10 expression was significantly shorter than that for patients with negative CD10 expression in all patients (p = 0.001) and in patients with epithelioid tumor (p = 0.04).

We evaluated the activity of everolimus, an oral mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, in patients with unresectable MPM. MPM patients who had received at least one but no more than two prior chemotherapy regimens, which must have been platinum-based, were treated with 10 mg of everolimus daily. The primary endpoint was 4-month progression-free survival (PFS) by RECIST 1.1. A total of 59 evaluable patients were included in the analysis. The median duration of treatment was 2 cycles (56 days). Overall response rate was 2% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0-12%] by RECIST 1.1 and 0% (0-10%) by modified RECIST for MPM. The 4-month PFS rate was 29% (95% CI: 17-41%) by RECIST 1.1, and 27% (95% CI: 16-39%) by modified RECIST. The median PFS was 2.8 months (95% CI: 1.8-3.4) by RECIST 1.1. The median overall survival was 6.3 months (95% CI: 4.0-8.0). There was no difference in PFS among patients who received one or two prior chemotherapy regimens (p = 0.74). There was no difference in overall survival between patients with epithelioid histology versus other types (p = 0.47).

Radiologic-pathologic correlation of mesothelioma tumor volume.,"Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",Lung Cancer,2015-01-20,"Tumor volume promises to become a more important factor in patient management. Mesothelioma, with its unique morphology and complex growth pattern, presents a challenging target for tumor volumetrics derived from computed tomography (CT) scans. This study evaluated the validity of image-based mesothelioma tumor volume against the physical volume of the tumor bulk captured by the images. Twenty-eight patients underwent CT scanning prior to pleurectomy/decortication with an intent to achieve a macroscopic complete resection. A radiologist manually outlined the tumor border in all CT sections in which tumor appeared in the pre-surgery scan. CT-based tumor volume was computed as the number of image pixels enclosed by all tumor outlines across all sections in the scan multiplied by the physical dimensions of the voxel of tissue captured by each image pixel. The gross tumor specimen volume was measured ex vivo through a water-displacement technique. Correlation between CT volume and pathology volume was calculated. A correlation coefficient r-squared value of 0.66 was found between CT-based tumor volume and gross tumor specimen volume. Differences between the mean volume (either CT volume or pathology volume) across tumors of different T stages did not achieve statistical significance. Despite a modest correlation between CT-based tumor volume and gross tumor specimen volume, image-based volumetry for mesothelioma is not straightforward-perhaps, in part, due to the challenges of distinguishing tumor borders from adjacent structures and perhaps, in part, due to a complex pathologic reference standard.",Journal Article,1827.0,10.0,Tumor volume promises to become a more important factor in patient management with its unique morphology and complex growth pattern presents a challenging target for tumor volumetrics derived from computed tomography CT scans This study evaluated the validity of image-based tumor volume against the physical volume of the tumor bulk captured by the images Twenty-eight patients underwent CT scanning prior to pleurectomy/decortication with an intent to achieve a macroscopic complete resection A radiologist manually outlined the tumor border in all CT sections in which tumor appeared in the pre-surgery scan CT-based tumor volume was computed as the number of image pixels enclosed by all tumor outlines across all sections in the scan multiplied by the physical dimensions of the voxel of tissue captured by each image pixel The gross tumor specimen volume was measured ex vivo through a water-displacement technique Correlation between CT volume and pathology volume was calculated A correlation coefficient r-squared value of 0.66 was found between CT-based tumor volume and gross tumor specimen volume Differences between the mean volume either CT volume or pathology volume across tumors of different T stages did not achieve statistical significance Despite a modest correlation between CT-based tumor volume and gross tumor specimen volume image-based volumetry for is not straightforward-perhaps in part due to the challenges of distinguishing tumor borders from adjacent structures and perhaps in part due to a complex pathologic reference standard,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[30, 433, 13313, 6, 1417, 8, 80, 305, 161, 4, 69, 284, 5, 211, 991, 2567, 2, 840, 129, 1177, 2740, 8, 1950, 283, 9, 30, 31574, 526, 29, 1220, 872, 425, 1441, 26, 45, 194, 3, 3099, 1, 1482, 90, 30, 433, 480, 3, 900, 433, 1, 3, 30, 5821, 4954, 20, 3, 1572, 737, 659, 7, 208, 425, 3702, 324, 6, 10707, 12319, 5, 35, 1697, 6, 1359, 8, 5897, 236, 170, 8, 6247, 8474, 6394, 3, 30, 11793, 4, 62, 425, 3013, 4, 92, 30, 2121, 4, 3, 671, 152, 1657, 425, 90, 30, 433, 10, 1220, 22, 3, 207, 1, 1482, 13596, 23628, 20, 62, 30, 6510, 716, 62, 3013, 4, 3, 1657, 16669, 20, 3, 900, 6190, 1, 3, 8400, 1, 246, 4954, 20, 296, 1482, 13070, 3, 1789, 30, 2360, 433, 10, 644, 2581, 386, 298, 8, 4388, 6850, 1312, 816, 59, 425, 433, 2, 1117, 433, 10, 981, 8, 816, 3200, 668, 8515, 549, 1, 13, 700, 10, 204, 59, 425, 90, 30, 433, 2, 1789, 30, 2360, 433, 362, 59, 3, 313, 433, 361, 425, 433, 15, 1117, 433, 716, 57, 1, 338, 102, 1153, 205, 44, 1359, 1050, 724, 550, 8, 1721, 816, 59, 425, 90, 30, 433, 2, 1789, 30, 2360, 433, 1482, 90, 14066, 9, 16, 44, 12753, 4434, 4, 760, 520, 6, 3, 1427, 1, 4508, 30, 14623, 29, 2086, 2414, 2, 4434, 4, 760, 520, 6, 8, 840, 510, 2482, 260]",1560.0,25641271,1
Analysis of BAP1 Germline Gene Mutation in Young Uveal Melanoma Patients.,Ophthalmic genetics,Ophthalmic Genet.,2015-02-17,"To evaluate the prevalence of BAP1 germline mutations in a series of young patients with uveal melanoma (UM), diagnosed before age 30. The study was carried out on 14 young uveal melanoma patients (average age 21.4 years, range 3 months to 29 years). Germline DNA was extracted from peripheral blood. BAP1 sequencing was carried out using direct sequencing of all exons and adjacent intronic sequences. We also tested for germline mutations in additional melanoma-associated candidate genes CDKN2A and CDK4 (exon 4). We identified one patient with a pathogenic mutation (c. 1717delC, p.L573fs*3) in BAP1. This patient was diagnosed with UM at age 18 years and had a family history of a father with UM and a paternal grandfather with cancer of unknown origin. One additional patient had an intronic variant of uncertain significance (c.123-48T > G) in BAP1 while the remaining 12 patients had no alteration. None of the patients had CDKN2A or CDK4 (Exon 4) mutations. Family history was positive for a number of additional malignancies in this series, in particular for cutaneous melanoma, prostate, breast and colon cancers. There were no families with a history of mesothelioma or renal cell carcinoma. This study suggests that a small subset of patients with early onset UM has germline mutation in BAP1.

A total of 169 patients underwent extrapleural pneumonectomy without preoperative chemotherapy between 2001 and 2010. Data for treatment, recurrence, and survival were determined from medical records. A thoracic radiologist reviewed postoperative computed tomography or positron emission tomography computed tomography scans to determine sites of recurrence. Time to recurrence was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Rates were compared using the Fisher exact test. The median age of patients was 62 years. Histology on final pathology was epithelial for 104 patients (62%) and nonepithelial for 65 patients (38%). A total of 132 patients (78%) received heated intraoperative chemotherapy; 77 patients (45%) received adjuvant chemotherapy, and 71 patients (42%) received adjuvant radiation therapy. Most chemotherapy regimens included platinum or pemetrexed. Median radiation therapy dose was 54 Gy. Among 158 evaluable patients, a recurrence developed in 118 (75%). Median follow-up was 83 months, median time to recurrence was 13.1 months, and median survival was 15 months. Sites of first recurrence were in the ipsilateral hemithorax or mediastinum for 54% of patients, in the abdomen for 39% of patients, in the contralateral hemithorax for 28% of patients, and in other distant sites for 5% of patients. Some patients had simultaneous recurrences in multiple sites. The most common site of recurrence after extrapleural pneumonectomy and planned multimodality therapy remains the ipsilateral hemithorax (including mediastinum), and true distant failure (other than the abdomen or contralateral hemithorax) remains unusual.

Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2015-03-20,"Vorinostat is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that changes gene expression and protein activity. On the basis of the clinical benefit reported in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma treated in a phase 1 study of vorinostat, we designed this phase 3 trial to investigate whether vorinostat given as a second-line or third-line therapy improved patients' overall survival. This double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was done in 90 international centres. Patients with measurable advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma and disease progression after one or two previous systemic regimens were eligible. After stratification for Karnofsky performance status, histology, and number of previous chemotherapy regimens, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of an interactive voice response system with a block size of four to either treatment with vorinostat or placebo. Patients received oral vorinostat 300 mg (or matching placebo) twice daily on days 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, and 17 of a 21-day cycle. The primary endpoints were overall survival and safety and tolerability of vorinostat. The primary efficacy comparison was done in the intention-to-treat population, and safety and tolerability was assessed in the treated population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00128102. From July 12, 2005, to Feb 14, 2011, 661 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either vorinostat (n=329) or placebo (n=332) and included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Median overall survival for vorinostat was 30·7 weeks (95% CI 26·7-36·1) versus 27·1 weeks (23·1-31·9) for placebo (hazard ratio 0·98, 95% CI 0·83-1·17, p=0·86). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events for patients treated with vorinostat were fatigue or malaise (51 [16%] patients in the vorinostat group vs 25 [8%] in the placebo group]) and dyspnoea (35 [11%] vs 45 [14%]). In this randomised trial, vorinostat given as a second-line or third-line therapy did not improve overall survival and cannot be recommended as a therapy for patients with advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma.

BAP1 missense mutation c.2054 A>T (p.E685V) completely disrupts normal splicing through creation of a novel 5' splice site in a human mesothelioma cell line.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2015-04-01,"BAP1 is a tumor suppressor gene that is lost or deleted in diverse cancers, including uveal mela¬noma, malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), clear cell renal carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma. Recently, BAP1 germline mutations have been reported in families with combinations of these same cancers. A particular challenge for mutation screening is the classification of non-truncating BAP1 sequence variants because it is not known whether these subtle changes can affect the protein function sufficiently to predispose to cancer development. Here we report mRNA splicing analysis on a homozygous substitution mutation, BAP1 c. 2054 A&T (p.Glu685Val), identified in an MPM cell line derived from a mesothelioma patient. The mutation occurred at the 3rd nucleotide from the 3' end of exon 16. RT-PCR, cloning and subsequent sequencing revealed several aberrant splicing products not observed in the controls: 1) a 4 bp deletion at the end of exon 16 in all clones derived from the major splicing product. The BAP1 c. 2054 A&T mutation introduced a new 5' splice site (GU), which resulted in the deletion of 4 base pairs and presumably protein truncation; 2) a variety of alternative splicing products that led to retention of different introns: introns 14-16; introns 15-16; intron 14 and intron 16; 3) partial intron 14 and 15 retentions caused by activation of alternative 3' splice acceptor sites (AG) in the introns. Taken together, we were unable to detect any correctly spliced mRNA transcripts in this cell line. These results suggest that aberrant splicing caused by this mutation is quite efficient as it completely abolishes normal splicing through creation of a novel 5' splice site and activation of cryptic splice sites. These data support the conclusion that BAP1 c.2054 A&T (p.E685V) variant is a pathogenic mutation and contributes to MPM through disruption of normal splicing.

BAP1 mutation is a frequent somatic event in peritoneal malignant mesothelioma.,Journal of translational medicine,J Transl Med,2015-04-16,"Malignant mesothelioma (MM) arises from mesothelial cells that line the pleural, peritoneal and pericardial surfaces. The majority of MMs are pleural and have been associated with asbestos exposure. Previously, pleural MMs have been genetically characterized by the loss of BAP1 (40-60%) as well as loss of NF2 (75%) and CDKN2A (60%). The rare peritoneal form of MM occurs in ~10% cases. With only ~300 cases diagnosed in the US per year, its link to asbestos exposure is not clear and its mutational landscape unknown. We analyzed the somatic mutational landscape of 12 peritoneal MM of epitheloid subtype using copy number analysis (N = 9), whole exome sequencing (N = 7) and targeted sequencing (N = 12). Peritoneal MM display few copy number alterations, with most samples having less than 10 Mbp total changes, mostly through deletions and no high copy number amplification. Chromosome band 3p21 encoding BAP1 is the most recurrently deleted region (5/9), while, in contrast to pleural MM, NF2 and CDKN2A are not affected. We further identified 87 non-silent mutations across 7 sequenced tumors, with a median of 8 mutated genes per tumor, resulting in a very low mutation rate (median 1.3 10(-6)). BAP1 was the only recurrently mutated gene (N = 3/7). In one additional case, loss of the entire chromosome 3 leaves a non-functional copy of BAP1 carrying a rare nonsense germline variant, thus suggesting a potential genetic predisposition in this patient. Finally, with targeted sequencing of BAP1 in 3 additional cases, we conclude that BAP1 is frequently altered through copy number losses (N = 3/12), mutations (N = 3/12) or both (N = 2/12) sometimes at a sub-clonal level.

Between March 2006 and April 2011, 53 patients with advanced malignant solid tumors were enrolled and treated with elisidepsin on the two different q3wk infusion schedules: 22 (30-min) and 31 (3-h), respectively. Doses evaluated ranged from 0.1 to 1.6 mg/m(2) (30-min q3wk) and from 2.0 to 11.0 mg flat dose (FD) (3-h q3wk). In the 30-min q3wk schedule, transient grade 3/4 increases in hepatic transaminases were the DLT, which appeared at the highest doses tested (from 1.1 to 1.6 mg/m(2)). No DLTs were observed on the 3-h schedule at doses up to 11.0 mg q3wk. Common adverse events were grade 1/2 pruritus, nausea, fatigue and hypersensitivity. Of note, myelotoxicity was not observed.

Extended Pleurectomy and Decortication for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma Is an Effective and Safe Cytoreductive Surgery in the Elderly.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2015-08-25,"A survival advantage has been observed among patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma undergoing maximal cytoreductive surgery and adjuvant therapy. Elderly patients are considered higher risk for these radical operations and are commonly not offered surgical treatment. We reviewed our experience with extended pleurectomy and decortication among patients 70 years or older and compared them with a cohort of younger patients undergoing extended pleurectomy and decortication for malignant pleural mesothelioma. We performed a retrospective review of 117 consecutive patients undergoing extended pleurectomy and decortication at a university hospital from January 2008 to December 2013. Patients 70 years and older were compared with younger patients for postoperative outcome and survival. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Fifty-four patients were 70 years or older; 63 were younger than 70 years. Older patients had more hypertension (71.2% versus 45.2%; p = 0.004) and coronary artery disease (22.6% versus 6.5%; p = 0.006). Major complications occurred in 3 patients (5.5%) in the older group and in 7 patients (11.1%) of the younger group (not significant). There were 2 deaths in each group after surgery (3.7% older versus 3.2% younger; not significant). Median survival was 15.6 months in the older patients and 14.0 months in the younger patients (not significant). Kaplan-Meier survival curves based on age groups were not significantly different with 1- and 2-year survivals of 64% versus 55% and 29% versus 32%, respectively.

A first-in-human phase 1 dose-escalation study evaluated the combination of LY with pemetrexed/carboplatin. Forty-one patients with advanced solid tumors received single-dose LY monotherapy lead-in and 37 patients received LY (10-120 mg) plus pemetrexed/carboplatin (500 mg/m(2) and 5-6 AUC, respectively) across 8 dose levels every 21 days. Primary objective was maximum tolerated dose (MTD) determination; secondary endpoints included safety, antitumor activity, pharmacokinetics, and beta-catenin pharmacodynamics. MTD of LY with pemetrexed/carboplatin was 40 mg. Eleven dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred in ten patients. DLTs during LY monotherapy occurred at ≥ 40 mg: grade 2 visual disturbance (n = 1) and grade 3/4 peri-infusional thoracic pain during or shortly post infusion (n = 4; chest, upper abdominal, and back pain). Ranitidine was added after de-escalation to 80 mg LY to minimize peri-infusional thoracic pain. Following LY with pemetrexed/carboplatin therapy, DLTs included grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia (n = 4) and grade 4 neutropenia (n = 1). Best overall response by RECIST included 5 confirmed partial responses (non-small cell lung cancer [n = 3], mesothelioma, and breast cancer) and 19 patients having stable disease. Systemic LY exposure was approximately linear over dose range studied. Transient upregulation of beta-catenin measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) occurred at 40 mg LY.

Loss of BAP1 function leads to EZH2-dependent transformation.,Nature medicine,Nat. Med.,2015-10-05,"The tumor suppressors BAP1 and ASXL1 interact to form a polycomb deubiquitinase complex that removes monoubiquitin from histone H2A lysine 119 (H2AK119Ub). However, BAP1 and ASXL1 are mutated in distinct cancer types, consistent with independent roles in regulating epigenetic state and malignant transformation. Here we demonstrate that Bap1 loss in mice results in increased trimethylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), elevated enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (Ezh2) expression, and enhanced repression of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) targets. These findings contrast with the reduction in H3K27me3 levels seen with Asxl1 loss. Conditional deletion of Bap1 and Ezh2 in vivo abrogates the myeloid progenitor expansion induced by Bap1 loss alone. Loss of BAP1 results in a marked decrease in H4K20 monomethylation (H4K20me1). Consistent with a role for H4K20me1 in the transcriptional regulation of EZH2, expression of SETD8-the H4K20me1 methyltransferase-reduces EZH2 expression and abrogates the proliferation of BAP1-mutant cells. Furthermore, mesothelioma cells that lack BAP1 are sensitive to EZH2 pharmacologic inhibition, suggesting a novel therapeutic approach for BAP1-mutant malignancies.

Mesothelin-Targeted CARs: Driving T Cells to Solid Tumors.,Cancer discovery,Cancer Discov,2015-10-26,"Chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) are synthetic receptors that target T cells to cell-surface antigens and augment T-cell function and persistence. Mesothelin is a cell-surface antigen implicated in tumor invasion, which is highly expressed in mesothelioma and lung, pancreas, breast, ovarian, and other cancers. Its low-level expression in mesothelia, however, commands thoughtful therapeutic interventions. Encouragingly, recent clinical trials evaluating active immunization or immunoconjugates in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma or mesothelioma have shown responses without toxicity. Altogether, these findings and preclinical CAR therapy models using either systemic or regional T-cell delivery argue favorably for mesothelin CAR therapy in multiple solid tumors. Recent success obtained with adoptive transfer of CAR T cells targeting CD19 in patients with refractory hematologic malignancies has generated much enthusiasm for T-cell engineering and raises the prospect of implementing similar strategies for solid tumors.

A Novel Tool for Predicting Major Complications After Cytoreductive Surgery with Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2015-12-17,"Cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS-HIPEC) has an emerging role in the treatment of peritoneal malignancies. The CRS-HIPEC approach has known treatment-related toxicities. This study sought to determine the predictors of major postoperative complications after CRS-HIPEC in a high-volume center. From a single-institution database, this study investigated complications experienced by patients undergoing CRS-HIPEC. Multiple preoperative and operative factors were analyzed for their ability to predict 60-day Clavien grade 3 and greater (major) complications by logistic regression. A predictive model was created from preoperative factors using multivariate logistic regression. The model was tested by Akaike's information criterion, the Hosmer and Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit Test, the receiver operating characteristic, and the Youden Index. The study evaluated 247 patients undergoing CRS-HIPEC. The primary tumor site was the appendix in 166 cases (67.2 %), the colorectal area in 51 cases (20.6 %), the peritoneum (mesothelioma) in 22 cases (8.9 %), the ovary in 5 cases (2 %), and the small bowel in 3 cases (1.2 %). The median peritoneal cancer index was 14 (range 0-29), and 235 patients (95.1 %) had a complete (CC-0/1) cytoreduction. Major complications occurred for 41 patients (16.6 %), classified as grade 3 in 33 cases (13.4 %), grade 4 in 5 cases (2 %), and grade 5 (deaths) in 3 cases (1.2 %).

A novel BAP1 mutation is associated with melanocytic neoplasms and thyroid cancer.,Cancer genetics,Cancer Genet,2015-12-22,"Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene, BRCA-1 associated protein (BAP1), underlie a tumor predisposition syndrome characterized by increased risk for numerous cancers including uveal melanoma, melanocytic tumors and mesothelioma, among others. In the present study we report the identification of a novel germline BAP1 mutation, c.1777C>T, which produces a truncated BAP1 protein product and segregates with cancer. Family members with this mutation demonstrated a primary clinical phenotype of autosomal dominant, early-onset melanocytic neoplasms with immunohistochemistry (IHC) of these tumors demonstrating lack of BAP1 protein expression. In addition, family members harboring the BAP1 c.1777C>T germline mutation developed other neoplastic disease including thyroid cancer. IHC analysis of the thyroid cancer, as well, demonstrated loss of BAP1 protein expression. Our investigation identifies a new BAP1 mutation, further highlights the relevance of BAP1 as a clinically important tumor suppressor gene, and broadens the range of cancers associated with BAP1 inactivation. Further study will be required to understand the full scope of BAP1-associated neoplastic disease.

Cancer Res.,2016-01-19,"This first-in-human phase I trial assessed the safety, tolerability, and preliminary antitumor activity of apitolisib (GDC-0980), a dual inhibitor of class I PI3K, and mTOR kinases. Once-daily oral apitolisib was administered to patients with solid tumors for days 1 to 21 or 1 to 28 of 28-day cycles. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were assessed. Overall, 120 patients were treated at doses between 2 and 70 mg. The commonest ≥G3 toxicities related to apitolisib at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) at 40 mg once daily included hyperglycemia (18%), rash (14%), liver dysfunction (12%), diarrhea (10%), pneumonitis (8%), mucosal inflammation (6%), and fatigue (4%). Dose-limiting toxicities (1 patient each) were G4 fasting hyperglycemia at 40 mg (21/28 schedule) and G3 maculopapular rash and G3 fasting hyperglycemia at 70 mg (21/28 schedule). The pharmacokinetic profile was dose-proportional. Phosphorylated serine-473 AKT levels were suppressed by ≥90% in platelet-rich plasma within 4 hours at the MTD (50 mg). Pharmacodynamic decreases in fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography uptake of >25% occurred in 66% (21/32) of patients dosed at 40 mg once daily. Evidence of single-agent activity included 10 RECIST partial responses (PR; confirmed for peritoneal mesothelioma, PIK3CA mutant head-and-neck cancer, and three pleural mesotheliomas). Apitolisib exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics with target modulation at doses ≥16 mg. The RP2D was 40 mg once-daily 28/28 schedule; severe on-target toxicities were apparent at ≥40 mg, particularly pneumonitis. Apitolisib was reasonably tolerated at 30 mg, the selected dose for pleural mesothelioma patients given limited respiratory reserve. Modest but durable antitumor activity was demonstrated.

Specimen weight and volume: important predictors of survival in malignant pleural mesothelioma.,European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,2016-01-21,"The tumour/node/metastasis (TNM) staging system for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a worldwide standard, but has many limitations. Tumour volume has been suggested as a predictor of survival. Due to the complex anatomy, estimation of tumour volume via CT scan can be challenging. Surgical volume may be more accurate. Therefore, we prospectively determined resected specimen volumes and weights in consecutive patients undergoing extended pleurectomy and decortication (EPD) and correlated this with overall survival and T and N stage. We evaluated 116 patients undergoing EPD for MPM in a single university centre over a 6-year period. All resected specimens were weighed, and the volume was measured by a fluid displacement method. A Cox regression model was used to identify significant predictors of survival; hazard ratios were calculated. A Kaplan-Meier method was used to summarize overall and subgroup survival. Logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of T and N stage. There were 95 males and 21 females with a median age of 68 range 43-88 years. Forty-one patients had an ECOG performance status (PS) 0, 70 had 1 and 4 had 2. The median time between initial diagnosis and surgery was 134 days. Histology was epithelioid in 59, biphasic in 55 and sarcomatoid in 2. The mean volume was 641 ml with an SD of 393.34 ml. The median volume was 567.5 ml. The mean weight was 620.8 g with an SD of 361.92 g. The median weight was 552.0 g. Two-year survival from initial diagnosis and from EPD was 44 and 28%, respectively. PS (P = 0.002), epithelioid histology (P < 0.001), specimen weight (P < 0.001), volume (P < 0.001), platelet count (P = 0.015), T1 stage (P = 0.04) and adjuvant therapy (P = 01) were predictive of survival. Tumour volume was a predictor of T stage (P = 0.048) and survival (P = 0.03). There was no relationship between N stage and tumour volume, weight or histology. PS, specimen weight, volume, epithelioid histology platelet count and adjuvant chemotherapy are significant predictors of survival in patients undergoing EPD for MPM. There is a correlation between specimen volume and T stage.

Contemporary Analysis of Prognostic Factors in Patients with Unresectable Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2015-12-10,"Previous prognostic scoring systems for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) included patients managed surgically and predated the use of pemetrexed. We analyzed prognostic factors in a contemporary cohort of patients with unresectable MPM who received pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. This single-institution analysis included patients with MPM who were managed nonsurgically from 2000 to 2013. Variables correlated with overall survival (OS) included sex, performance status (PS), asbestos exposure, tumor laterality, histology, clinical stage, initial positron emission tomography maximum standardized uptake value, hemoglobin level, platelet count, lymphocyte count, white cell and neutrophil counts, treatment type, and clinical benefit from treatment. OS was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method, and significance (p < 0.05) of prognostic factors was analyzed by the log-rank test and Cox regression. A total of 191 patients met the study criteria: median age 71 years (range 46-90), 147 men (77%), 128 epithelioid tumors (67%), and 157 cases of stage III or IV MPM (82%). Median OS for all patients was 13.4 months. According to a univariate analysis, histology (p < 0.001), platelet count (< or = 450,000 versus >450,000, p < 0.001), initial PS (0-1 versus > or = 2), maximum standardized uptake value (< or = 8.1 versus >8.1, p = 0.037), and lymphocyte counts (p = 0.019) were associated with OS. According to a multivariable analysis, only histology, platelet count, and PS were independent prognostic factors. Epithelioid histology, PS, and elevated lymphocyte count at diagnosis were significantly associated with clinical benefit from first-line chemotherapy.

Pilot and Feasibility Trial Evaluating Immuno-Gene Therapy of Malignant Mesothelioma Using Intrapleural Delivery of Adenovirus-IFNα Combined with Chemotherapy.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2016-03-11,"""In situ vaccination"" using immunogene therapy has the ability to induce polyclonal antitumor responses directed by the patient's immune system. Patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) received two intrapleural doses of a replication-defective adenoviral vector containing the human IFNα2b gene (Ad.IFN) concomitant with a 14-day course of celecoxib followed by chemotherapy. Primary outcomes were safety, toxicity, and objective response rate; secondary outcomes included progression-free and overall survival. Biocorrelates on blood and tumor were measured. Forty subjects were treated: 18 received first-line pemetrexed-based chemotherapy, 22 received second-line chemotherapy with pemetrexed (n = 7) or gemcitabine (n = 15). Treatment was generally well tolerated. The overall response rate was 25%, and the disease control rate was 88%. Median overall survival (MOS) for all patients with epithelial histology was 21 months versus 7 months for patients with nonepithelial histology. MOS in the first-line cohort was 12.5 months, whereas MOS for the second-line cohort was 21.5 months, with 32% of patients alive at 2 years. No biologic parameters were found to correlate with response, including numbers of activated blood T cells or NK cells, regulatory T cells in blood, peak levels of IFNα in blood or pleural fluid, induction of antitumor antibodies, nor an immune-gene signature in pretreatment biopsies. The combination of intrapleural Ad.IFN, celecoxib, and chemotherapy proved safe in patients with MPM. OS rate was significantly higher than historical controls in the second-line group.

Unique fractal evaluation and therapeutic implications of mitochondrial morphology in malignant mesothelioma.,Scientific reports,Sci Rep,2016-04-15,"Malignant mesothelioma (MM), is an intractable disease with limited therapeutic options and grim survival rates. Altered metabolic and mitochondrial functions are hallmarks of MM and most other cancers. Mitochondria exist as a dynamic network, playing a central role in cellular metabolism. MM cell lines display a spectrum of altered mitochondrial morphologies and function compared to control mesothelial cells. Fractal dimension and lacunarity measurements are a sensitive and objective method to quantify mitochondrial morphology and most importantly are a promising predictor of response to mitochondrial inhibition. Control cells have high fractal dimension and low lacunarity and are relatively insensitive to mitochondrial inhibition. MM cells exhibit a spectrum of sensitivities to mitochondrial inhibitors. Low mitochondrial fractal dimension and high lacunarity correlates with increased sensitivity to the mitochondrial inhibitor metformin. Lacunarity also correlates with sensitivity to Mdivi-1, a mitochondrial fission inhibitor. MM and control cells have similar sensitivities to cisplatin, a chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of MM.

North American Multicenter Volumetric CT Study for Clinical Staging of Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma: Feasibility and Logistics of Setting Up a Quantitative Imaging Study.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2016-05-12,"Clinical tumor (T), node, and metastasis staging is based on a qualitative assessment of features defining T descriptors and has been found to be suboptimal for predicting the prognosis of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Previous work suggests that volumetric computed tomography (VolCT) is prognostic and, if found practical and reproducible, could improve clinical MPM classification. Six North American institutions electronically submitted clinical, pathologic, and imaging data on patients with stages I to IV MPM to an established multicenter database and biostatistical center. Two reference radiologists blinded to clinical data independently reviewed the scans; calculated clinical T, node, and metastasis stage by standard criteria; performed semiautomated tumor volume calculations using commercially available software; and submitted the findings to the biostatistical center. Study end points included the feasibility of a multi-institutional VolCT network, concordance of independent VolCT assessments, and association of VolCT with pathological T classification. Of 164 submitted cases, 129 were evaluated by both reference radiologists. Discordant clinical staging of most cases confirmed the inadequacy of current criteria. The overall correlation between VolCT estimates was good (Spearman correlation 0.822), but some were significantly discordant. Root cause analysis of the most discordant estimates identified four common sources of variability. Despite these limitations, median tumor volume estimates were similar within subgroups of cases representing each pathological T descriptor and increased monotonically for each reference radiologist with increasing pathological T status. The good correlation between VolCT estimates obtained for most cases reviewed by two independent radiologists and qualitative association of VolCT with pathological T status combine to encourage further study. The identified sources of user error will inform design of a follow-up prospective trial to more formally assess interobserver variability of VolCT and its potential contribution to clinical MPM staging.",Journal Article,1349.0,22.0,Clinical tumor T node and metastasis staging is based on a qualitative assessment of features defining T descriptors and has been found to be suboptimal for predicting the prognosis of patients with malignant pleural MPM Previous work suggests that volumetric computed tomography VolCT is prognostic and if found practical and reproducible could improve clinical MPM classification Six North American institutions electronically submitted clinical pathologic and imaging data on patients with stages I to IV MPM to an established multicenter database and biostatistical center Two reference radiologists blinded to clinical data independently reviewed the scans calculated clinical T node and metastasis stage by standard criteria performed semiautomated tumor volume calculations using commercially available software and submitted the findings to the biostatistical center Study end points included the feasibility of a multi-institutional VolCT network concordance of independent VolCT assessments and association of VolCT with pathological T classification Of 164 submitted cases 129 were evaluated by both reference radiologists Discordant clinical staging of most cases confirmed the inadequacy of current criteria The overall correlation between VolCT estimates was good Spearman correlation 0.822 but some were significantly discordant Root cause analysis of the most discordant estimates identified four common sources of variability Despite these limitations median tumor volume estimates were similar within subgroups of cases representing each pathological T descriptor and increased monotonically for each reference radiologist with increasing pathological T status The good correlation between VolCT estimates obtained for most cases reviewed by two independent radiologists and qualitative association of VolCT with pathological T status combine to encourage further study The identified sources of user error will inform design of a follow-up prospective trial to more formally assess interobserver variability of VolCT and its potential contribution to clinical MPM staging,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[38, 30, 102, 289, 2, 278, 632, 16, 90, 23, 8, 3926, 455, 1, 404, 2847, 102, 10494, 2, 71, 85, 204, 6, 40, 3291, 9, 1434, 3, 356, 1, 7, 5, 393, 2164, 3278, 698, 1357, 844, 17, 4083, 1220, 872, 25760, 16, 177, 2, 492, 204, 3320, 2, 4172, 359, 401, 38, 3278, 947, 437, 2669, 597, 1764, 14980, 5118, 38, 510, 2, 270, 74, 23, 7, 5, 1153, 70, 6, 478, 3278, 6, 35, 635, 1570, 609, 2, 22300, 574, 100, 2482, 3915, 3288, 6, 38, 74, 1042, 446, 3, 1441, 981, 38, 102, 289, 2, 278, 82, 20, 260, 371, 173, 12574, 30, 433, 8229, 75, 5262, 390, 3639, 2, 5118, 3, 272, 6, 3, 22300, 574, 45, 396, 862, 159, 3, 1437, 1, 8, 1414, 1115, 25760, 1801, 1827, 1, 306, 25760, 2182, 2, 248, 1, 25760, 5, 1301, 102, 947, 1, 5279, 5118, 140, 4649, 11, 194, 20, 110, 2482, 3915, 4570, 38, 632, 1, 96, 140, 557, 3, 24543, 1, 291, 371, 3, 63, 816, 59, 25760, 1423, 10, 1178, 5061, 816, 13, 15711, 84, 476, 11, 97, 4570, 8386, 708, 65, 1, 3, 96, 4570, 1423, 108, 294, 186, 3375, 1, 1982, 550, 46, 1939, 52, 30, 433, 1423, 11, 288, 262, 1453, 1, 140, 2861, 296, 1301, 102, 16471, 2, 101, 21568, 9, 296, 2482, 6247, 5, 602, 1301, 102, 156, 3, 1178, 816, 59, 25760, 1423, 683, 9, 96, 140, 446, 20, 100, 306, 3915, 2, 3926, 248, 1, 25760, 5, 1301, 102, 156, 4680, 6, 7113, 195, 45, 3, 108, 3375, 1, 10188, 3444, 303, 2295, 771, 1, 8, 166, 126, 482, 160, 6, 80, 9790, 423, 5393, 1982, 1, 25760, 2, 211, 174, 2925, 6, 38, 3278, 632]",2090.0,27180318,56
Phase II Study of Hemithoracic Intensity-Modulated Pleural Radiation Therapy (IMPRINT) As Part of Lung-Sparing Multimodality Therapy in Patients With Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-06-20,"We conducted a two-center phase II study to determine the safety of hemithoracic intensity-modulated pleural radiation therapy (IMPRINT) after chemotherapy and pleurectomy-decortication (P/D) as part of a multimodality lung-sparing treatment. Patients received up to four cycles of pemetrexed plus platinum. If feasible, P/D was performed. Hemithoracic IMPRINT was administered to a planned dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. The primary end point was the incidence of grade 3 or greater radiation pneumonitis (RP). A total of 45 patients were enrolled; 18 were not evaluable (because of disease progression before radiation therapy [RT], n = 9; refusal of surgery or RT, n = 5; extrapleural pneumonectomy at time of surgery, n = 2; or chemotherapy complications, n = 2). A total of 26 patients received pemetrexed plus cisplatin, 18 received pemetrexed plus carboplatin, and four received a combination. Thirteen patients (28.9%) had a partial response, 15 patients (33.3%) experienced disease progression, one patient died during chemotherapy, and all others had stable disease. Eight patients underwent P/D or an extended P/D, and 13 underwent a partial P/D. A total of 27 patients started IMPRINT (median dose, 46.8 Gy; range, 28.8 to 50.4 Gy) and were evaluable for the primary end point (median follow-up, 21.6 months). Six patients experienced grade 2 RP, and two patients experienced grade 3 RP; all recovered after corticosteroid initiation. No grade 4 or 5 radiation-related toxicities were observed. The median progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) were 12.4 and 23.7 months, respectively; the 2-year OS was 59% in patients with resectable tumors and was 25% in patients with unresectable tumors. Hemithoracic IMPRINT for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is safe and has an acceptable rate of RP. Its incorporation with chemotherapy and P/D forms a new lung-sparing treatment paradigm for patients with locally advanced MPM.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",1310.0,64.0,We conducted a two-center phase II study to determine the safety of hemithoracic intensity-modulated pleural radiation therapy IMPRINT after chemotherapy and pleurectomy-decortication P/D as part of a multimodality lung-sparing treatment Patients received up to four cycles of pemetrexed plus platinum If feasible P/D was performed Hemithoracic IMPRINT was administered to a planned dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions The primary end point was the incidence of grade 3 or greater radiation pneumonitis RP A total of 45 patients were enrolled 18 were not evaluable because of disease progression before radiation therapy RT n 9 refusal of surgery or RT n 5 extrapleural pneumonectomy at time of surgery n 2 or chemotherapy complications n 2 A total of 26 patients received pemetrexed plus cisplatin 18 received pemetrexed plus carboplatin and four received a combination Thirteen patients 28.9 had a partial response 15 patients 33.3 experienced disease progression one patient died during chemotherapy and all others had stable disease Eight patients underwent P/D or an extended P/D and 13 underwent a partial P/D A total of 27 patients started IMPRINT median dose 46.8 Gy range 28.8 to 50.4 Gy and were evaluable for the primary end point median follow-up 21.6 months Six patients experienced grade 2 RP and two patients experienced grade 3 RP all recovered after corticosteroid initiation No grade 4 or 5 radiation-related toxicities were observed The median progression-free survival and overall survival OS were 12.4 and 23.7 months respectively the 2-year OS was 59 in patients with resectable tumors and was 25 in patients with unresectable tumors Hemithoracic IMPRINT for malignant pleural MPM is safe and has an acceptable rate of RP Its incorporation with chemotherapy and P/D forms a new lung-sparing treatment paradigm for patients with locally advanced MPM,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 426, 8, 100, 574, 124, 215, 45, 6, 223, 3, 367, 1, 11964, 837, 1757, 2164, 121, 36, 12752, 50, 56, 2, 10707, 12319, 19, 427, 22, 760, 1, 8, 2425, 5184, 1851, 24, 7, 103, 126, 6, 294, 410, 1, 2046, 349, 828, 492, 1313, 19, 427, 10, 173, 11964, 12752, 10, 468, 6, 8, 1465, 61, 1, 212, 39, 381, 4, 339, 1550, 3, 86, 396, 741, 10, 3, 287, 1, 88, 27, 15, 378, 121, 2949, 1622, 8, 181, 1, 512, 7, 11, 346, 203, 11, 44, 859, 408, 1, 34, 91, 348, 121, 36, 240, 78, 83, 8104, 1, 152, 15, 240, 78, 33, 9113, 4853, 28, 98, 1, 152, 78, 18, 15, 56, 521, 78, 18, 8, 181, 1, 432, 7, 103, 2046, 349, 540, 203, 103, 2046, 349, 927, 2, 294, 103, 8, 150, 3170, 7, 339, 83, 42, 8, 450, 51, 167, 7, 466, 27, 592, 34, 91, 104, 69, 1016, 190, 56, 2, 62, 1749, 42, 585, 34, 659, 7, 208, 19, 427, 15, 35, 1747, 19, 427, 2, 233, 208, 8, 450, 19, 427, 8, 181, 1, 428, 7, 3461, 12752, 52, 61, 641, 66, 381, 184, 339, 66, 6, 212, 39, 381, 2, 11, 859, 9, 3, 86, 396, 741, 52, 166, 126, 239, 49, 53, 437, 7, 592, 88, 18, 1622, 2, 100, 7, 592, 88, 27, 1622, 62, 5784, 50, 5654, 1118, 77, 88, 39, 15, 33, 121, 139, 385, 11, 164, 3, 52, 91, 115, 25, 2, 63, 25, 118, 11, 133, 39, 2, 382, 67, 53, 106, 3, 18, 111, 118, 10, 728, 4, 7, 5, 1899, 57, 2, 10, 243, 4, 7, 5, 1468, 57, 11964, 12752, 9, 393, 2164, 3278, 16, 1165, 2, 71, 35, 1595, 116, 1, 1622, 211, 2838, 5, 56, 2, 19, 427, 2377, 8, 217, 5184, 1851, 24, 2431, 9, 7, 5, 795, 131, 3278]",1866.0,27325859,63

Human CAR T cells with cell-intrinsic PD-1 checkpoint blockade resist tumor-mediated inhibition.,The Journal of clinical investigation,J. Clin. Invest.,2016-07-25,"Following immune attack, solid tumors upregulate coinhibitory ligands that bind to inhibitory receptors on T cells. This adaptive resistance compromises the efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies, which redirect T cells to solid tumors. Here, we investigated whether programmed death-1-mediated (PD-1-mediated) T cell exhaustion affects mesothelin-targeted CAR T cells and explored cell-intrinsic strategies to overcome inhibition of CAR T cells. Using an orthotopic mouse model of pleural mesothelioma, we determined that relatively high doses of both CD28- and 4-1BB-based second-generation CAR T cells achieved tumor eradication. CAR-mediated CD28 and 4-1BB costimulation resulted in similar levels of T cell persistence in animals treated with low T cell doses; however, PD-1 upregulation within the tumor microenvironment inhibited T cell function. At lower doses, 4-1BB CAR T cells retained their cytotoxic and cytokine secretion functions longer than CD28 CAR T cells.

Fine needle aspirate flow cytometric phenotyping characterizes immunosuppressive nature of the mesothelioma microenvironment.,Scientific reports,Sci Rep,2016-08-19,"With the emergence of checkpoint blockade and other immunotherapeutic drugs, and the growing adoption of smaller, more flexible adaptive clinical trial designs, there is an unmet need to develop diagnostics that can rapidly immunophenotype patient tumors. The ability to longitudinally profile the tumor immune infiltrate in response to immunotherapy also presents a window of opportunity to illuminate mechanisms of resistance. We have developed a fine needle aspirate biopsy (FNA) platform to perform immune profiling on thoracic malignancies. Matching peripheral blood, bulk resected tumor, and FNA were analyzed from 13 mesothelioma patients. FNA samples yielded greater numbers of viable cells when compared to core needle biopsies. Cell numbers were adequate to perform flow cytometric analyses on T cell lineage, T cell activation and inhibitory receptor expression, and myeloid immunosuppressive checkpoint markers. FNA samples were representative of the tumor as a whole as assessed by head-to-head comparison to single cell suspensions of dissociated whole tumor. Parallel analysis of matched patient blood enabled us to establish quality assurance criteria to determine the accuracy of FNA procedures to sample tumor tissue.

Six institutions electronically submitted to an established multicenter database clinical and pathologic data for patients with MPM who had operations. Institutional radiologists reviewed preoperative CT scans for quality and then submitted by electronic network (AG Mednet, www.agmednet.com) to the biostatistical center. Two reference radiologists blinded to clinical data performed semiautomated tumor volume calculations using Vitrea Enterprise 6.0 software (Vital Images, Minnetonka, MN) and then submitted readings to the biostatistical center. Study end points included feasibility of the network, interobserver variability for volumetric CT, correlation of tumor volume to pTN stages, and overall survival (OS). Of 164 patients, the CT scans for 129 were analyzable and read by reference radiologists. Most tumors were less than 500 cm(3). A small bias was observed between readers because one provided consistently larger measurements than the other (mean difference, 47.9; p = .0027), but for 80%, the absolute difference was 200 cm(3) or less. Spearman correlation between readers was 0.822.

PI3 Kinase Pathway and MET Inhibition is Efficacious in Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma.,Scientific reports,Sci Rep,2016-09-13,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive cancer that is commonly associated with prior asbestos exposure. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as MET and its downstream target PI3K are overexpressed and activated in a majority of MPMs. Here, we studied the combinatorial therapeutic efficacy of the MET/ALK inhibitor crizotinib, with either a pan-class I PI3K inhibitor, BKM120, or with a PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor, GDC-0980, in mesothelioma. Cell viability results showed that MPM cells were highly sensitive to crizotinib, BKM120 and GDC-0980 when used individually and their combination was more effective in suppressing growth. Treatment of MPM cells with these inhibitors also significantly decreased cell migration, and the combination of them was synergistic. Treatment with BKM120 alone or in combination with crizotinib induced G2-M arrest and apoptosis. Both crizotinib and BKM120 strongly inhibited the activity of MET and PI3K as evidenced by the decreased phosphorylation of MET, AKT and ribosomal S6 kinase. Using a PDX mouse model, we showed that a combination of crizotinib with BKM120 was highly synergetic in inhibiting MPM tumor growth.

The IASLC Mesothelioma Staging Project: Improving Staging of a Rare Disease Through International Participation.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2016-09-23,"For nearly 40 years, there was no generally accepted staging system for malignant pleural mesothelioma. In 1994, members of the International Mesothelioma Interest Group, in collaboration with the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, proposed a TNM staging system based on analyses of outcomes in retrospective surgical series and small clinical trials. Subsequently accepted by the American Joint Commission on Cancer and the Union for International Cancer Control for the sixth editions of their staging manuals, this system has since been the international staging standard.

The IASLC Mesothelioma Staging Project: Proposals for the M Descriptors and for Revision of the TNM Stage Groupings in the Forthcoming (Eighth) Edition of the TNM Classification for Mesothelioma.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2016-09-28,"The M component and TNM stage groupings for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) have been empirical. The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer developed a multinational database to propose evidence-based revisions for the eighth edition of the TNM classification of MPM. Data from 29 centers were submitted either electronically or by transfer of existing institutional databases. The M component as it currently stands was validated by confirming sufficient discrimination (by Kaplan-Meier analysis) with respect to overall survival (OS) between the clinical M0 (cM0) and cM1 categories. Candidate stage groups were developed by using a recursive partitioning and amalgamation algorithm applied to all cM0 cases. Of 3519 submitted cases, 2414 were analyzable and 84 were cM1 cases. Median OS for cM1 cases was 9.7 months versus 13.4 months (p = 0.0013) for the locally advanced (T4 or N3) cM0 cases, supporting inclusion of only cM1 in the stage IV group. Exploratory analyses suggest a possible difference in OS for single- versus multiple-site cM1 cases. A recursive partitioning and amalgamation-generated survival tree on the OS outcomes restricted to cM0 cases with the newly proposed (eighth edition) T and N components indicates that optimal stage groupings for the eighth edition will be as follows: stage IA (T1N0), stage IB (T2-3N0), stage II (T1-2N1), stage IIIA (T3N1), stage IIIB (T1-3N2 or any T4), and stage IV (any M1).

Amount of Epithelioid Differentiation Is a Predictor of Survival in Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2016-10-17,"Macroscopic complete surgical resection with adjuvant chemotherapy can provide a survival advantage in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Patients with nonepithelioid histology are largely excluded from such radical operations even though they might benefit. The degree of epithelioid differentiation varies in biphasic histology. We report the outcomes of pleurectomy and decortication and the effect of epithelioid differentiation on overall survival of patients with MPM. This report is based on the outcomes of 144 patients who underwent pleurectomy and decortication at a single institution between 2008 and 2015. The variables assessed were age, gender, histology, and pathologic T and N stage. No patients with pure sarcomatoid histology were included. Two independent pathologists estimated the percentage of epithelioid histology. A Cox regression model was used to identify significant predictors of survival. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to summarize overall and subgroup survival. Included were 116 men and 28 women with a median age of 69 years (range, 43 to 88 years). The 2-year survival from pleurectomy and decortication was 20%.

Extended Pleurectomy-Decortication-Based Treatment for Advanced Stage Epithelial Mesothelioma Yielding a Median Survival of Nearly Three Years.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2016-11-05,"The purpose of this study was to assess survival for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), epithelial subtype, utilizing extended pleurectomy-decortication combined with intraoperative photodynamic therapy (PDT) and adjuvant pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. From 2005 to 2013, 90 patients underwent lung-sparing surgery and PDT for MPM. All patients had a preoperative diagnosis of epithelial subtype, of which 17 proved to be of mixed histology. The remaining 73 patients with pure epithelial subtype were analyzed. All patients received lung-sparing surgery and PDT; 92% also received chemotherapy. The median follow-up was 5.3 years for living patients. Macroscopic complete resection was achieved in all 73 patients. Thirty-day mortality was 3% and 90-day mortality was 4%. For all 73 patients (89% American Joint Commission on Cancer stage III/IV, 69% N2 disease, median tumor volume 550 mL), the median overall and disease-free survivals were 3 years and 1.2 years, respectively. For the 19 patients without lymph node metastases (74% stage III/IV, median tumor volume 325 mL), the median overall and disease-free survivals were 7.3 years and 2.3 years, respectively. This is a mature dataset for MPM that demonstrates the ability to safely execute a complex treatment plan that included a surgical technique that consistently permitted achieving a macroscopic complete resection while preserving the lung. The role for lung-sparing surgery is unclear but this series demonstrates that it is an option, even for advanced cases. The overall survival of 7.3 years for the node negative subset of patients, still of advanced stage, is encouraging. Of particular interest is the overall survival being approximately triple the disease-free survival, perhaps PDT related.

Cytotoxic T Cells in PD-L1-Positive Malignant Pleural Mesotheliomas Are Counterbalanced by Distinct Immunosuppressive Factors.,Cancer immunology research,Cancer Immunol Res,2016-11-14,"PD-L1 immunohistochemical staining does not always predict whether a cancer will respond to treatment with PD-1 inhibitors. We sought to characterize immune cell infiltrates and the expression of T-cell inhibitor markers in PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative malignant pleural mesothelioma samples. We developed a method for immune cell phenotyping using flow cytometry on solid tumors that have been dissociated into single-cell suspensions and applied this technique to analyze 43 resected malignant pleural mesothelioma specimens. Compared with PD-L1-negative tumors, PD-L1-positive tumors had significantly more infiltrating CD45<sup>+</sup> immune cells, a significantly higher proportion of infiltrating CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells, and a significantly higher percentage of CD3<sup>+</sup> cells displaying the activated HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>/CD38<sup>+</sup> phenotype. PD-L1-positive tumors also had a significantly higher proportion of proliferating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, a higher fraction of FOXP3<sup>+</sup>/CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs, and increased expression of PD-1 and TIM-3 on CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Double-positive PD-1<sup>+</sup>/TIM-3<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were more commonly found on PD-L1-positive tumors. Compared with epithelioid tumors, sarcomatoid and biphasic mesothelioma samples were significantly more likely to be PD-L1 positive and showed more infiltration with CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells and PD-1<sup>+</sup>/TIM-3<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Immunologic phenotypes in mesothelioma differ based on PD-L1 status and histologic subtype. Successful incorporation of comprehensive immune profiling by flow cytometry into prospective clinical trials could refine our ability to predict which patients will respond to specific immune checkpoint blockade strategies.

The effects of 5 risk factors for OS and PFS, including age, histology, performance status (PS), white blood cell count, and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) risk score, were used in the analysis. Individual-level surrogacy was assessed by Kendall's tau through a Clayton bivariate Copula survival (CBCS) model. Summary-level surrogacy was evaluated via the association between logarithms of the hazard ratio (log HR)-log HR<sub>OS</sub> and log HR<sub>PFS</sub>-measured in <i>R<sup>2</sup></i> from a weighted least-square (WLS) regression model and the CBCS model. The median PFS for all patients was 3.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8-3.5 months) and the median OS was 7.2 months (95% CI, 6.5-8.0 months). Moderate correlations between PFS and OS were observed across all risk factors at the individual level, with Kendall's tau ranging from 0.46 to 0.47. The summary-level surrogacy varied among risk factors. The Copula <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> ranged from 0.51 for PS to 0.78 for histology. The WLS <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> ranged from 0.26 for EORTC and PS to 0.67 for age. The analyses demonstrated low to moderate individual-level surrogacy between PFS and OS. At the summary level, the surrogacy between PFS and OS varied significantly across different risk factors. With a short postprogression survival and a moderate correlation between PFS and OS, there is no evidence that PFS is a valid surrogate endpoint for OS in malignant mesothelioma. <b>

FTY720 inhibits mesothelioma growth in vitro and in a syngeneic mouse model.,Journal of translational medicine,J Transl Med,2017-03-15,"Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a very aggressive type of cancer, with a dismal prognosis and inherent resistance to chemotherapeutics. Development and evaluation of new therapeutic approaches is highly needed. Immunosuppressant FTY720, approved for multiple sclerosis treatment, has recently raised attention for its anti-tumor activity in a variety of cancers. However, its therapeutic potential in MM has not been evaluated yet. Cell viability and anchorage-independent growth were evaluated in a panel of MM cell lines and human mesothelial cells (HM) upon FTY720 treatment to assess in vitro anti-tumor efficacy. The mechanism of action of FTY720 in MM was assessed by measuring the activity of phosphatase protein 2A (PP2A)-a major target of FTY720. The binding of the endogenous inhibitor SET to PP2A in presence of FTY720 was evaluated by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Signaling and activation of programmed cell death were evaluated by immunoblotting and flow cytometry. A syngeneic mouse model was used to evaluate anti-tumor efficacy and toxicity profile of FTY720 in vivo. We show that FTY720 significantly suppressed MM cell viability and anchorage-independent growth without affecting normal HM cells. FTY720 inhibited the phosphatase activity of PP2A by displacement of SET protein, which appeared overexpressed in MM, as compared to HM cells. FTY720 promoted AKT dephosphorylation and Bcl-2 degradation, leading to induction of programmed cell death, as demonstrated by caspase-3 and PARP activation, as well as by cytochrome c and AIF intracellular translocation. Moreover, FTY720 administration in vivo effectively reduced tumor burden in mice without apparent toxicity.

Improved Outcomes with Modern Lung-Sparing Trimodality Therapy in Patients with Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2017-03-21,"Higher target conformity and better sparing of organs at risk with modern radiotherapy (RT) may result in higher tumor control and less toxicity. In this study, we compare our institutional multimodality therapy experience of adjuvant chemotherapy and hemithoracic intensity-modulated pleural RT (IMPRINT) with previously used adjuvant conventional RT (CONV) in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) treated with lung-sparing pleurectomy/decortication (P/D). We analyzed 209 patients who underwent P/D and adjuvant RT (131 who received CONV and 78 who received IMPRINT) for MPM between 1974 and 2015. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model were used to calculate OS; competing risks analysis was performed for local failure-free survival and progression-free survival. Univariate analysis and multivariate analysis were performed with relevant clinical and treatment factors. The median age was 64 years, and 80% of the patients were male. Patients receiving IMPRINT had significantly higher rates of the epithelial histological type, advanced pathological stage, and chemotherapy treatment. OS was significantly higher after IMPRINT (median 20.2 versus 12.3 months, p = 0.001). Higher Karnofsky performance score, epithelioid histological type, macroscopically complete resection, and use of chemotherapy/IMPRINT were found to be significant factors for longer OS in multivariate analysis.

Combined Inhibition of NEDD8-Activating Enzyme and mTOR Suppresses <i>NF2</i> Loss-Driven Tumorigenesis.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2017-05-03,"Inactivation of <i>NF2</i>/Merlin causes the autosomal-dominant cancer predisposition syndrome familial neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and contributes to the development of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). To develop a targeted therapy for <i>NF2</i>-mutant tumors, we have exploited the recent realization that Merlin loss drives tumorigenesis by activating the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4<sup>DCAF1</sup>, thereby inhibiting the Hippo pathway component Lats. Here, we show that MLN4924, a NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor, suppresses CRL4<sup>DCAF1</sup> and attenuates activation of YAP in <i>NF2</i>-mutant tumor cells. In addition, MLN4924 sensitizes MPM to traditional chemotherapy, presumably as a result of collateral inhibition of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRL) involved in DNA repair. However, even in combination with chemotherapy, MLN4924 does not exhibit significant preclinical activity. Further analysis revealed that depletion of DCAF1 or treatment with MLN4924 does not affect mTOR hyperactivation in <i>NF2</i>-mutant tumor cells, suggesting that loss of Merlin activates mTOR independently of CRL4<sup>DCAF1</sup> Intriguingly, combining MLN4924 with the mTOR/PI3K inhibitor GDC-0980 suppresses the growth of <i>NF2</i>-mutant tumor cells <i>in vitro</i> as well as in mouse and patient-derived xenografts.

CAR T-cell therapy for lung cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma.,Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,Transl Res,2017-04-26,"Immunotherapy is a promising field that harnesses the power of the immune system as a therapeutic agent for cancer treatment. Beneficial outcomes shown in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) with relatively higher tumor-infiltrating T cells, combined with impressive responses obtained in a cohort of patients with NSCLC following checkpoint blockade therapy, lays a strong foundation to promote effector immune responses in these patients. One such approach being investigated is administration of tumor antigen-targeted T cells with transduction of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). CARs are synthetic receptors that enhance T-cell antitumor effector function and have gained momentum to investigate in solid tumors based on recent successes of clinical trials treating patients with B-cell hematologic malignancies. This review summarizes target antigens for CAR T-cell therapy that are being investigated in preclinical studies and clinical trials for both NSCLC and MPM patients.

A Subset of Malignant Mesotheliomas in Young Adults Are Associated With Recurrent EWSR1/FUS-ATF1 Fusions.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2017-07-01,"Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a rare, aggressive tumor often associated with asbestos exposure and characterized by complex genetic abnormalities, including deletions of chromosome 22. A gene fusion involving EWSR1 and YY1 gene on 14q32 has been reported in 2 patients over the age of 60 with peritoneal MM. However, the incidence of EWSR1 rearrangements in MM and the spectrum of its fusion partners remain unknown. We recently encountered 2 MM cases with EWSR1-ATF1 fusions and sought to investigate the prevalence and clinicopathologic features associated with this abnormality. As both index cases occurred as intra-abdominal tumors in young adults, we searched our files for pleural and peritoneal MM occurring in adults younger than age of 40. All cases were tested by fluorescence in situ hybridization using custom bacterial artificial chromosomes probes for EWSR1, FUS, and ATF1 genes. When available, immunohistochemistry for BAP1 was performed. A total of 25 MM from patients aged 40 or less were screened, either from peritoneum (n=13) or pleura (n=12), with a median age of 31 (range: 7 to 40 y). Two additional ATF1-rearranged tumors were identified at pleural and peritoneal sites with EWSR1 and FUS as fusion partners, respectively, for a total of 4 cases (16%, 4/25). The fusion-positive cases displayed classic epithelioid morphology, immunoreactivity for cytokeratins and WT1, and negativity for S100. BAP1 expression was retained in the 3 fusion-positive cases with available material, and in 80% (12/15) of the fusion-negative cases. Our results expand the spectrum of tumor types harboring EWSR1/FUS-ATF1 gene fusions to include a subgroup of conventional epithelioid MM.

Phase I Trial of Cediranib in Combination with Cisplatin and Pemetrexed in Chemonaive Patients with Unresectable Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (SWOG S0905).,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2017-06-06,"In malignant pleural mesothelioma, targeting angiogenesis with cediranib, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibitor, may have therapeutic potential. S0905 phase I combined cediranib (two dose cohorts [30 mg and 20 mg daily]) with cisplatin-pemetrexed for six cycles followed by maintenance cediranib in unresectable chemonaive patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma of any histologic subtype. The primary end point established the maximum tolerated dose in combination with cisplatin-pemetrexed in a dose deescalation scheme. A total of 20 patients were enrolled (seven to the 30-mg cohort and 13 to the 20-mag cohort). In the cediranib 30-mg cohort, two of the initial six patients reported dose-limiting toxicities and the dose was deemed too toxic to continue. In the next cohort, two patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities, and thus, the maximum tolerated dose of cediranib was established as 20 mg. During the six cycles of cisplatin-pemetrexed-cediranib, 20 mg, there were grade 3 toxicities (neutropenia and gastrointestinal) and grade 4 thrombocytopenia. No patients had any significant episodes of bleeding. According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (n = 17 evaluable patients), the median progression-free survival was 12.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.9-17.2); according to the Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (n = 19 evaluable patients), the median progression-free survival was 8.6 months (95% CI: 6.1-10.9). For all patients, the disease control rate at 6 weeks was 90% and median overall survival time was 16.2 months (95% CI: 10.5-28.7). Cediranib combined with cisplatin-pemetrexed has a reasonable toxicity profile and preliminary promising efficacy. The phase II S0905 trial will evaluate the efficacy of the triplet regimen compared with the current standard of care, cisplatin-pemetrexed.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",959.0,11.0,In malignant pleural targeting angiogenesis with cediranib a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibitor may have therapeutic potential S0905 phase I combined cediranib two dose cohorts 30 mg and 20 mg daily with cisplatin-pemetrexed for six cycles followed by maintenance cediranib in unresectable chemonaive patients with malignant pleural of any histologic subtype The primary end point established the maximum tolerated dose in combination with cisplatin-pemetrexed in a dose deescalation scheme A total of 20 patients were enrolled seven to the 30-mg cohort and 13 to the 20-mag cohort In the cediranib 30-mg cohort two of the initial six patients reported dose-limiting toxicities and the dose was deemed too toxic to continue In the next cohort two patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities and thus the maximum tolerated dose of cediranib was established as 20 mg.

LUME-Meso: Design and Rationale of the Phase III Part of a Placebo-Controlled Study of Nintedanib and Pemetrexed/Cisplatin Followed by Maintenance Nintedanib in Patients With Unresectable Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma.,Clinical lung cancer,Clin Lung Cancer,2017-03-22,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare but aggressive disease: median survival is 6 to 9 months if untreated. Standard first-line treatment for patients with unresectable MPM is cisplatin/pemetrexed, with a median overall survival (OS) of approximately 1 year. Improvements in first-line treatment options are needed. With the benefit of combining bevacizumab with standard therapy shown in the Mesothelioma Avastin Cisplatin Pemetrexed Study (MAPS), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway inhibition has gained renewed interest as a treatment approach. Nintedanib is an oral angiokinase inhibitor targeting multiple signaling pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of MPM, including the VEGF receptor. The phase III part of the international, phase II/III LUME-Meso study is evaluating the efficacy and safety of nintedanib plus pemetrexed/cisplatin in patients with unresectable epithelioid MPM. Originally, this was a double-blind, randomized, phase II exploratory study and was amended to include a confirmatory phase III part following the recommendation of an internal Data Monitoring Committee and review of phase II data. The phase III part plans to enroll 450 chemotherapy-naive patients, who will be randomized to receive pemetrexed/cisplatin on day 1 and nintedanib or placebo on days 2 to 21, for a maximum of 6 cycles. Patients without disease progression who are eligible to continue study treatment will receive maintenance treatment with nintedanib or placebo until disease progression or undue toxicity. The primary end point is progression-free survival; OS is the key secondary end point. The study will use an adaptive design, including an interim analysis to reassess the number of OS events required to ensure sufficient power for OS analysis. The study is currently enrolling patients.","Clinical Trial, Phase III",1035.0,7.0,Malignant pleural MPM is a rare but aggressive disease median survival is 6 to 9 months if untreated Standard first-line treatment for patients with unresectable MPM is cisplatin/pemetrexed with a median overall survival OS of approximately 1 year Improvements in first-line treatment options are needed With the benefit of combining bevacizumab with standard therapy shown in the Avastin Cisplatin Pemetrexed Study MAPS vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF pathway inhibition has gained renewed interest as a treatment approach Nintedanib is an oral angiokinase inhibitor targeting multiple signaling pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of MPM including the VEGF receptor The phase III part of the international phase II/III LUME-Meso study is evaluating the efficacy and safety of nintedanib plus pemetrexed/cisplatin in patients with unresectable epithelioid MPM Originally this was a double-blind randomized phase II exploratory study and was amended to include a confirmatory phase III part following the recommendation of an internal Data Monitoring Committee and review of phase II data The phase III part plans to enroll 450 chemotherapy-naive patients who will be randomized to receive pemetrexed/cisplatin on day 1 and nintedanib or placebo on days 2 to 21 for a maximum of 6 cycles Patients without disease progression who are eligible to continue study treatment will receive maintenance treatment with nintedanib or placebo until disease progression or undue toxicity The primary end point is progression-free survival OS is the key secondary end point The study will use an adaptive design including an interim analysis to reassess the number of OS events required to ensure sufficient power for OS analysis The study is currently enrolling patients,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[393, 2164, 3278, 16, 8, 622, 84, 571, 34, 52, 25, 16, 49, 6, 83, 53, 492, 1278, 260, 157, 328, 24, 9, 7, 5, 1468, 3278, 16, 540, 2046, 5, 8, 52, 63, 25, 118, 1, 705, 14, 111, 1474, 4, 157, 328, 24, 838, 32, 575, 5, 3, 247, 1, 1525, 599, 5, 260, 36, 443, 4, 3, 11262, 540, 2046, 45, 5845, 756, 845, 129, 161, 618, 308, 297, 71, 3711, 8126, 1333, 22, 8, 24, 353, 11527, 16, 35, 518, 48755, 230, 529, 232, 314, 460, 1771, 4, 3, 1384, 1, 3278, 141, 3, 618, 153, 3, 124, 316, 760, 1, 3, 944, 124, 215, 316, 47483, 17810, 45, 16, 1435, 3, 209, 2, 367, 1, 11527, 349, 2046, 540, 4, 7, 5, 1468, 3838, 3278, 5045, 26, 10, 8, 1627, 3142, 384, 124, 215, 2386, 45, 2, 10, 7595, 6, 643, 8, 5697, 124, 316, 760, 366, 3, 3347, 1, 35, 2329, 74, 1315, 2002, 2, 206, 1, 124, 215, 74, 3, 124, 316, 760, 1853, 6, 6559, 5669, 56, 2462, 7, 54, 303, 40, 384, 6, 560, 2046, 540, 23, 218, 14, 2, 11527, 15, 619, 23, 162, 18, 6, 239, 9, 8, 689, 1, 49, 410, 7, 187, 34, 91, 54, 32, 625, 6, 1906, 45, 24, 303, 560, 1146, 24, 5, 11527, 15, 619, 1100, 34, 91, 15, 22030, 155, 3, 86, 396, 741, 16, 91, 115, 25, 118, 16, 3, 825, 568, 396, 741, 3, 45, 303, 119, 35, 2454, 771, 141, 35, 2914, 65, 6, 19046, 3, 207, 1, 118, 281, 616, 6, 3478, 1952, 2349, 9, 118, 65, 3, 45, 16, 694, 6280, 7]",1770.0,28690011,111

Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2017-07-17,"New therapeutic strategies for malignant mesothelioma are urgently needed. In the DETERMINE study, we investigated the effects of the cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) monoclonal antibody tremelimumab in patients with previously treated advanced malignant mesothelioma. DETERMINE was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial done at 105 study centres across 19 countries in patients with unresectable pleural or peritoneal malignant mesothelioma who had progressed after one or two previous systemic treatments for advanced disease. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and measurable disease as defined in the modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 for pleural mesothelioma or RECIST version 1.1 for peritoneal mesothelioma. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) in blocks of three, stratified by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer status (low risk vs high risk), line of therapy (second line vs third line), and anatomic site (pleural vs peritoneal), by use of an interactive voice or web system, to receive intravenous tremelimumab (10 mg/kg) or placebo every 4 weeks for 7 doses and every 12 weeks thereafter until a treatment discontinuation criterion was met. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The trial is ongoing but no longer recruiting participants, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01843374. Between May 17, 2013, and Dec 4, 2014, 571 patients were randomly assigned to receive tremelimumab (n=382) or placebo (n=189), of whom 569 patients received treatment (two patients in the tremelimumab group were excluded from the safety population because they did not receive treatment). At the data cutoff date (Jan 24, 2016), 307 (80%) of 382 patients had died in the tremelimumab group and 154 (81%) of 189 patients had died in the placebo group. Median overall survival in the intention-to-treat population did not differ between the treatment groups: 7·7 months (95% CI 6·8-8·9) in the tremelimumab group and 7·3 months (5·9-8·7) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·92 [95% CI 0·76-1·12], p=0·41). Treatment-emergent adverse events of grade 3 or worse occurred in 246 (65%) of 380 patients in the tremelimumab group and 91 (48%) of 189 patients in the placebo group; the most common were dyspnoea (34 [9%] patients in the tremelimumab group vs 27 [14%] patients in the placebo group), diarrhoea (58 [15%] vs one [<1%]), and colitis (26 [7%] vs none). The most common serious adverse events were diarrhoea (69 [18%] patients in the tremelimumab group vs one [<1%] patient in the placebo group), dyspnoea (29 [8%] vs 24 [13%]), and colitis (24 [6%] vs none). Treatment-emergent events leading to death occurred in 36 (9%) of 380 patients in the tremelimumab group and 12 (6%) of 189 in the placebo group; those leading to the death of more than one patient were mesothelioma (three [1%] patients in the tremelimumab group vs two [1%] in the placebo group), dyspnoea (three [1%] vs two [1%]); respiratory failure (one [<1%] vs three [2%]), myocardial infarction (three [1%] vs none), lung infection (three [1%] patients vs none), cardiac failure (one [<1%] vs one [<1%]), and colitis (two [<1%] vs none). Treatment-related adverse events leading to death occurred in five (1%) patients in the tremelimumab group and none in the placebo group. The causes of death were lung infection in one patient, intestinal perforation and small intestinal obstruction in one patient; colitis in two patients, and neuritis and skin ulcer in one patient. Tremelimumab did not significantly prolong overall survival compared with placebo in patients with previously treated malignant mesothelioma. The safety profile of tremelimumab was consistent with the known safety profile of CTLA-4 inhibitors.

Heart Dosimetry is Correlated With Risk of Radiation Pneumonitis After Lung-Sparing Hemithoracic Pleural Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2017-04-27,"To determine clinically helpful dose-volume and clinical metrics correlating with symptomatic radiation pneumonitis (RP) in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) patients with 2 lungs treated with hemithoracic intensity modulated pleural radiation therapy (IMPRINT). Treatment plans and resulting normal organ dose-volume histograms of 103 consecutive MPM patients treated with IMPRINT (February 2005 to January 2015) to the highest dose ≤50.4 Gy satisfying departmental normal tissue constraints were uniformly recalculated. Patient records provided maximum RP grade (Common Terminology Criteria for Toxicity and Adverse Event version 4.0) and clinical and demographic information. Correlations analyzed with the Cox model were grade ≥2 RP (RP2+) and grade ≥3 RP (RP3+) with clinical variables, with volumes of planning target volume (PTV) and PTV-lung overlap and with mean dose, percent volume receiving dose D (V<sub>D</sub>), highest dose encompassing % volume V, (D<sub>V</sub>), and heart, total, ipsilateral, and contralateral lung volumes. Twenty-seven patients had RP2+ (14 with RP3+). The median prescription dose was 46.8 Gy (39.6-50.4 Gy, 1.8 Gy/fraction). The median age was 67.6 years (range, 42-83 years). There were 79 men, 40 never-smokers, and 44 with left-sided MPM. There were no significant (P≤.05) correlations with clinical variables, prescription dose, total lung dose-volume metrics, and PTV-lung overlap volume. Dose-volume correlations for heart were RP2+ with V<sub>D</sub> (35 ≤ D ≤ 47 Gy, V<sub>43</sub> strongest at P=.003), RP3+ with V<sub>D</sub> (31 ≤ D ≤ 45 Gy), RP2+ with D<sub>V</sub> (5 ≤ V ≤ 30%), RP3+ with D<sub>V</sub> (15 ≤ V ≤ 35%), and mean dose. Significant for ipsilateral lung were RP2+ with V<sub>D</sub> (38 ≤ D ≤ 44 Gy), RP3+ with V<sub>41</sub>, RP2+ and RP3+ with minimum dose, and for contralateral lung, RP2+ with maximum dose. Correlation of PTV with RP2+ was strong (P<.001) and also significant with RP3+.

Long-Term Survival Outcomes of Cancer-Directed Surgery for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma: Propensity Score Matching Analysis.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2017-08-17,"Purpose Small observational studies have shown a survival advantage to undergoing cancer-directed surgery for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM); however, it is unclear if these results are generalizable. Our purpose was to evaluate survival after treatment of MPM with cancer-directed surgery and to explore the effect surgery interaction with chemotherapy or radiation therapy on survival by using the National Cancer Database. Patients and Methods Patients with microscopically proven MPM were identified within the National Cancer Database (2004 to 2014). Propensity score matching was performed 1:2 and among this cohort, a Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to identify predictors of survival. Median survival was calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results Of 20,561 patients with MPM, 6,645 were identified in the matched cohort, among whom 2,166 underwent no therapy, 2,015 underwent chemotherapy alone, 850 underwent cancer-directed surgery alone, 988 underwent surgery with chemotherapy, and 274 underwent trimodality therapy. The remaining 352 patients underwent another combination of surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. Thirty-day and 90-day mortality rates were 6.3% and 15.5%. Cancer-directed surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy were independently associated with improved survival (hazard ratio, 0.77, 0.74, and 0.88, respectively).

Global health and variables in function and symptom domains were investigated. Sub-groups analyses were performed for ECOG performance status (PS), histological sub-types and pathological tumor volume (pTV). Within-patient comparisons to baseline scores were made using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Trends over time were evaluated using Cuzick's nonparametric test.

Cancer Res.,2017-09-28,"<b>Purpose:</b> Determine the 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate among patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) receiving the WT1 peptide vaccine galinpepimut-S after multimodality therapy versus those receiving control adjuvants.<b>Experimental Design:</b> This double-blind, controlled, two center phase II trial randomized MPM patients after surgery and another treatment modality to galinpepimut-S with GM-CSF and Montanide or GM-CSF and Montanide alone. An improvement in 1-year PFS from 50% to 70% was the predefined efficacy threshold, and 78 patients total were planned. The study was not powered for comparison between the two arms.<b>Results:</b> Forty-one patients were randomized. Treatment-related adverse events were mild, self-limited, and not clinically significant. On the basis of a stringent prespecified futility analysis (futility = ≥10 of 20 patients on one arm experiencing progression < 1 year), the control arm closed early. The treatment arm was subsequently closed because of the resultant unblinding. The PFS rate at 1 year from beginning study treatment was 33% and 45% in the control and vaccine arms, respectively. Median PFS was 7.4 months versus 10.1 months and median OS was 18.3 months versus 22.8 months in the control and vaccine arms, respectively.<b>Conclusions:</b> The favorable safety profile was confirmed. PFS and OS were greater in those who received vaccine, but the trial was neither designed nor powered for comparison between the arms.

Predictors of trimodality therapy and trends in therapy for malignant pleural mesothelioma.,European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,2018-05-01,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma is an aggressive and rare malignancy that frequently recurs despite aggressive therapy. We evaluated the frequency of treatment with surgery, radiation or chemotherapy, changes in therapy and survival over time and factors associated with the receipt of trimodality therapy. The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was used to query patients with histologically proven malignant pleural mesothelioma (2004-14). Treatment over time was evaluated using the Armitage trend test. Factors associated with the receipt of trimodality therapy were analysed using logistic regression. Among 20 561 patients, only 4028 (20%) underwent cancer-directed surgery; 533 (2.6%) of whom received trimodality therapy. From 2004 to 2014, the use of surgery with chemotherapy increased 87% (P < 0.01), with no statistically significant change in the use of trimodality therapy. Median survival also increased from 8 months to 11 months (P < 0.01). Patients who were treated at an academic centre or who travel >26 miles for treatment were more likely to undergo trimodality therapy.

Focal adhesion kinase a potential therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma.,Cancer biology & therapy,Cancer Biol. Ther.,2018-02-22,"The non-receptor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) is known to play a key role in a variety of normal and cancer cellular functions such as survival, proliferation, migration and invasion. It is highly active and overexpressed in various cancers including Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM). Here, initially, we demonstrate that FAK is overexpressed in both PDAC and MPM cell lines. Then we analyze effects of two small molecule inhibitors PF-573228, and PF-431396, which are dual specificity inhibitors of FAK and proline rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2), as well as VS-6063, another small molecule inhibitor that specifically inhibits FAK but not PYK2 for cell growth, motility and invasion of PDAC and MPM cell lines. Treatment with PF-573228, PF-431396 and VS-6063 cells resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of growth and anchorage-independent colony formation in both cancer cell lines. Furthermore, these compounds suppressed the phosphorylation of FAK at its active site, Y397, and functionally induced significant apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in both cell lines. Using the ECIS (Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing) system, we found that treatment of both PF compounds suppressed adherence and migration of PDAC cells on fibronectin. Interestingly, 3D-tumor organoids derived from autochthonous KC (Kras;PdxCre) mice treated with PF-573228 revealed a significant decrease in tumor organoid size and increase in organoid cell death. Taken together, our results show that FAK is an important target for mesothelioma and pancreatic cancer therapy that merit further translational studies.",Journal Article,698.0,18.0,The non-receptor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Focal Adhesion Kinase FAK is known to play a key role in a variety of normal and cancer cellular functions such as survival proliferation migration and invasion It is highly active and overexpressed in various cancers including Ductal Adenocarcinoma PDAC and Malignant Pleural MPM Here initially we demonstrate that FAK is overexpressed in both PDAC and MPM cell lines Then we analyze effects of two small molecule inhibitors PF-573228 and PF-431396 which are dual specificity inhibitors of FAK and proline rich tyrosine kinase 2 PYK2 as well as VS-6063 another small molecule inhibitor that specifically inhibits FAK but not PYK2 for cell growth motility and invasion of PDAC and MPM cell lines Treatment with PF-573228 PF-431396 and VS-6063 cells resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of growth and anchorage-independent colony formation in both cancer cell lines Furthermore these compounds suppressed the phosphorylation of FAK at its active site Y397 and functionally induced significant apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in both cell lines Using the ECIS Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing system we found that treatment of both PF compounds suppressed adherence and migration of PDAC cells on fibronectin Interestingly 3D-tumor organoids derived from autochthonous KC Kras PdxCre mice treated with PF-573228 revealed a significant decrease in tumor organoid size and increase in organoid cell death Taken together our results show that FAK is an important target for and cancer therapy that merit further translational studies,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 220, 153, 2828, 564, 216, 2137, 2128, 216, 3248, 16, 440, 6, 1343, 8, 825, 200, 4, 8, 1362, 1, 295, 2, 12, 763, 1681, 225, 22, 25, 457, 1381, 2, 578, 192, 16, 561, 544, 2, 1711, 4, 747, 163, 141, 1258, 449, 1356, 2, 393, 2164, 3278, 467, 1625, 21, 608, 17, 3248, 16, 1711, 4, 110, 1356, 2, 3278, 31, 285, 818, 21, 1992, 176, 1, 100, 302, 1354, 222, 3313, 41948, 2, 3313, 50798, 92, 32, 1828, 1121, 222, 1, 3248, 2, 13850, 3697, 564, 216, 18, 16621, 22, 149, 22, 105, 29955, 1809, 302, 1354, 230, 17, 1225, 1576, 3248, 84, 44, 16621, 9, 31, 129, 3603, 2, 578, 1, 1356, 2, 3278, 31, 285, 24, 5, 3313, 41948, 3313, 50798, 2, 105, 29955, 37, 627, 4, 8, 61, 470, 297, 1, 129, 2, 5573, 306, 1975, 1264, 4, 110, 12, 31, 285, 798, 46, 2411, 1908, 3, 982, 1, 3248, 28, 211, 544, 606, 15358, 2, 3772, 277, 93, 351, 2, 31, 417, 1854, 4, 110, 31, 285, 75, 3, 71911, 16190, 31, 4235, 18526, 8350, 398, 21, 204, 17, 24, 1, 110, 3313, 2411, 1908, 2149, 2, 1381, 1, 1356, 37, 23, 8629, 2873, 2265, 30, 8018, 526, 29, 11647, 14631, 723, 71912, 399, 73, 5, 3313, 41948, 553, 8, 93, 775, 4, 30, 11722, 444, 2, 344, 4, 11722, 31, 273, 1633, 1162, 114, 99, 514, 17, 3248, 16, 35, 305, 283, 9, 2, 12, 36, 17, 7062, 195, 2460, 94]",1585.0,29303405,73
Biomarker-Integrated Neoadjuvant Dasatinib Trial in Resectable Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2017-12-05,"Window of opportunity trials in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) are challenging but can yield important translational information about a novel agent. We treated patients with MPM (N = 24) with 4 weeks of oral dasatinib followed by surgery with or without radiotherapy and then an optional 2 years of maintenance dasatinib. The primary end point was biomarker modulation of phosphorylated (p) Src<sup>Tyr419</sup>. For all patients, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.5 months and the median overall survival was 19.1 months. No significant responses were seen after 4 weeks of dasatinib therapy; however, modulation of median p-Src<sup>Tyr419</sup> immunohistochemistry (IHC) scores was seen: the median pretreatment score was 70 (interquartile range 37.5-110), and the median posttreatment score was 41.9 (interquartile range 4.2-60) (p = 0.004). A decrease in p-Src<sup>Tyr419</sup> levels after dasatinib correlated with improved median PFS (6.9 months versus 0.94 months [p = 0.03]), suggesting that p-Src<sup>Tyr419</sup> is a viable pharmacodynamic biomarker for dasatinib in MPM. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) pathway analysis correlated high PDGFR beta [PDGFRB) level (in the cytoplasm [hazard ratio] (HR) = 2.54, p = 0.05], stroma [HR = 2.79, p = 0.03], and nucleus [HR = 6.79, p = 0.023]) with a shorter PFS. Low (less than the median) cytoplasmic p-PDGFR alpha IHC levels were predictive of a decrease in positron emission tomography/computed tomography standard uptake values levels after dasatinib therapy (p = 0.04), whereas higher-than-median IHC scores of PDGFRB (cytoplasmic [HR = 2.8, p = 0.03] and nuclear [HR = 6.795, p = 0.02]) were correlated with rising standard uptake values levels. In conclusion, there was no significant efficacy signal, and dasatinib monotherapy will not continue to be studied in MPM. However, our study demonstrated that PDGFR subtypes (platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha and PDGFRB) may have differential roles in prognosis and resistance to antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors and are important potential therapeutic targets that require further investigation.",Journal Article,777.0,2.0,Window of opportunity trials in malignant pleural MPM are challenging but can yield important translational information about a novel agent We treated patients with MPM N 24 with 4 weeks of oral dasatinib followed by surgery with or without radiotherapy and then an optional 2 years of maintenance dasatinib The primary end point was biomarker modulation of phosphorylated p Src sup Tyr419 /sup For all patients the median progression-free survival PFS was 7.5 months and the median overall survival was 19.1 months No significant responses were seen after 4 weeks of dasatinib therapy however modulation of median p-Src sup Tyr419 /sup immunohistochemistry IHC scores was seen the median pretreatment score was 70 interquartile range 37.5-110 and the median posttreatment score was 41.9 interquartile range 4.2-60 p 0.004 A decrease in p-Src sup Tyr419 /sup levels after dasatinib correlated with improved median PFS 6.9 months versus 0.94 months p 0.03 suggesting that p-Src sup Tyr419 /sup is a viable pharmacodynamic biomarker for dasatinib in MPM Platelet-derived growth factor receptor PDGFR pathway analysis correlated high PDGFR beta PDGFRB level in the cytoplasm hazard ratio HR 2.54 p 0.05 stroma HR 2.79 p 0.03 and nucleus HR 6.79 p 0.023 with a shorter PFS Low less than the median cytoplasmic p-PDGFR alpha IHC levels were predictive of a decrease in positron emission tomography/computed tomography standard uptake values levels after dasatinib therapy p 0.04 whereas higher-than-median IHC scores of PDGFRB cytoplasmic HR 2.8 p 0.03 and nuclear HR 6.795 p 0.02 were correlated with rising standard uptake values levels In conclusion there was no significant efficacy signal and dasatinib monotherapy will not continue to be studied in MPM However our study demonstrated that PDGFR subtypes platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha and PDGFRB may have differential roles in prognosis and resistance to antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors and are important potential therapeutic targets that require further investigation,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[5421, 1, 2666, 143, 4, 393, 2164, 3278, 32, 1950, 84, 122, 2309, 305, 2460, 487, 545, 8, 229, 420, 21, 73, 7, 5, 3278, 78, 259, 5, 39, 244, 1, 518, 1674, 370, 20, 152, 5, 15, 187, 310, 2, 818, 35, 9281, 18, 60, 1, 1146, 1674, 3, 86, 396, 741, 10, 901, 2356, 1, 2365, 19, 2023, 172, 36529, 172, 9, 62, 7, 3, 52, 91, 115, 25, 300, 10, 67, 33, 53, 2, 3, 52, 63, 25, 10, 326, 14, 53, 77, 93, 253, 11, 527, 50, 39, 244, 1, 1674, 36, 137, 2356, 1, 52, 19, 2023, 172, 36529, 172, 888, 1289, 703, 10, 527, 3, 52, 1194, 368, 10, 431, 2899, 184, 567, 33, 3129, 2, 3, 52, 3149, 368, 10, 605, 83, 2899, 184, 39, 18, 335, 19, 13, 1520, 8, 775, 4, 19, 2023, 172, 36529, 172, 148, 50, 1674, 438, 5, 231, 52, 300, 49, 83, 53, 185, 13, 960, 53, 19, 13, 680, 802, 17, 19, 2023, 172, 36529, 172, 16, 8, 2663, 2424, 901, 9, 1674, 4, 3278, 1596, 526, 129, 161, 153, 4103, 308, 65, 438, 64, 4103, 1090, 10231, 301, 4, 3, 4558, 360, 197, 168, 18, 667, 19, 13, 474, 2477, 168, 18, 842, 19, 13, 680, 2, 4262, 168, 49, 842, 19, 13, 4482, 5, 8, 985, 300, 154, 299, 76, 3, 52, 2828, 19, 4103, 950, 1289, 148, 11, 464, 1, 8, 775, 4, 1900, 1799, 872, 1220, 872, 260, 1135, 1030, 148, 50, 1674, 36, 19, 13, 755, 547, 142, 76, 52, 1289, 703, 1, 10231, 2828, 168, 18, 66, 19, 13, 680, 2, 928, 168, 49, 12823, 19, 13, 588, 11, 438, 5, 3699, 260, 1135, 1030, 148, 4, 1221, 125, 10, 77, 93, 209, 1235, 2, 1674, 1411, 303, 44, 1906, 6, 40, 656, 4, 3278, 137, 114, 45, 264, 17, 4103, 814, 1596, 526, 129, 161, 153, 950, 2, 10231, 68, 47, 1777, 1790, 4, 356, 2, 251, 6, 2168, 564, 216, 222, 2, 32, 305, 174, 189, 637, 17, 1353, 195, 940]",2045.0,29313814,83
Nuclear grade and necrosis predict prognosis in malignant epithelioid pleural mesothelioma: a multi-institutional study.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2018-01-12,"A recently described nuclear grading system predicted survival in patients with epithelioid malignant pleural mesothelioma. The current study was undertaken to validate the grading system and to identify additional prognostic factors. We analyzed cases of epithelioid malignant pleural mesothelioma from 17 institutions across the globe from 1998 to 2014. Nuclear grade was computed combining nuclear atypia and mitotic count into a grade of I-III using the published system. Nuclear grade was assessed by one pathologist for three institutions, the remaining were scored independently. The presence or absence of necrosis and predominant growth pattern were also evaluated. Two additional scoring systems were evaluated, one combining nuclear grade and necrosis and the other mitotic count and necrosis. Median overall survival was the primary endpoint. A total of 776 cases were identified including 301 (39%) nuclear grade I tumors, 354 (45%) grade II tumors and 121 (16%) grade III tumors. The overall survival was 16 months, and correlated independently with age (P=0.006), sex (0.015), necrosis (0.030), mitotic count (0.001), nuclear atypia (0.009), nuclear grade (<0.0001), and mitosis and necrosis score (<0.0001). The addition of necrosis to nuclear grade further stratified overall survival, allowing classification of epithelioid malignant pleural mesothelioma into four distinct prognostic groups: nuclear grade I tumors without necrosis (29 months), nuclear grade I tumors with necrosis and grade II tumors without necrosis (16 months), nuclear grade II tumors with necrosis (10 months) and nuclear grade III tumors (8 months).

EphB4: A promising target for upper aerodigestive malignancies.,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Reviews on cancer,Biochim Biophys Acta Rev Cancer,2018-01-31,"The erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma (Eph) receptors are the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that include two major subclasses, EphA and EphB. They form an important cell communication system with critical and diverse roles in a variety of biological processes during embryonic development. However, dysregulation of the Eph/ephrin interactions is implicated in cancer contributing to tumour growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Here, we focus on EphB4 and review recent developments in elucidating its role in upper aerodigestive malignancies to include lung cancer, head and neck cancer, and mesothelioma. In particular, we summarize information regarding EphB4 structure/function and role in disease pathobiology. We also review the data supporting EphB4 as a potential pharmacological and immunotherapy target and finally, progress in the development of new therapeutic strategies including small molecule inhibitors of its activity is discussed.

Eighth Edition Staging of Thoracic Malignancies: Implications for the Reporting Pathologist.,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med.,2018-02-26,"Context The Staging and Prognostic Factors Committee of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, in conjunction with the International Mesothelioma Interest Group, the International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group, and the Worldwide Esophageal Cancer Collaboration, developed proposals for the 8th edition of their respective tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging classification systems. Objective To review these changes and discuss issues for the reporting pathologist. Data Sources Proposals were based on international databases of lung (N = 94 708), with an external validation using the US National Cancer Database; mesothelioma (N = 3519); thymic epithelial tumors (10 808); and epithelial cancers of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction (N = 22 654). Conclusions These proposals have been mostly accepted by the Union for International Cancer Control and the American Joint Committee on Cancer and incorporated into their respective staging manuals (2017).

Dynamic contrast-enhanced CT for the assessment of tumour response in malignant pleural mesothelioma: a pilot study.,European radiology,Eur Radiol,2018-07-02,"The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the utility of haemodynamic parameters derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (DCE-CT) scans in the assessment of tumour response to treatment in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) patients. The patient cohort included nine patients undergoing chemotherapy and five patients on observation. Each patient underwent two DCE-CT scans separated by approximately 2 months. The DCE-CT parameters of tissue blood flow (BF) and tissue blood volume (BV) were obtained within the dynamically imaged tumour. Mean relative changes in tumour DCE-CT parameters between scans were compared between the on-treatment and on-observation cohorts. DCE-CT parameter changes were correlated with relative change in tumour bulk evaluated according to the modified RECIST protocol. Differing trends in relative change in BF and BV between scans were found between the two patient groups (p = 0.19 and p = 0.06 for BF and BV, respectively). No significant rank correlations were found when comparing relative changes in DCE-CT parameters with relative change in tumour bulk. Differing trends in the relative change of BF and BV between patients on treatment and on observation indicate the potential of DCE-CT for the assessment of pharmacodynamic endpoints with respect to treatment in MPM. A future study with a larger patient cohort and unified treatment regimens should be undertaken to confirm the results of this pilot study. • CT-derived haemodynamic parameters show differing trends between malignant pleural mesothelioma patients on treatment and patients off treatment • Changes in haemodynamic parameters do not correlate with changes in tumour bulk as measured according to the modified RECIST protocol • Differing trends across the two patient groups indicate the potential sensitivity of DCE-CT to assess pharmacodynamic endpoints in the treatment of MPM.",Journal Article,568.0,1.0,The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the utility of haemodynamic parameters derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography DCE-CT scans in the assessment of tumour response to treatment in malignant pleural MPM patients The patient cohort included nine patients undergoing chemotherapy and five patients on observation Each patient underwent two DCE-CT scans separated by approximately 2 months The DCE-CT parameters of tissue blood flow BF and tissue blood volume BV were obtained within the dynamically imaged tumour Mean relative changes in tumour DCE-CT parameters between scans were compared between the on-treatment and on-observation cohorts DCE-CT parameter changes were correlated with relative change in tumour bulk evaluated according to the modified RECIST protocol Differing trends in relative change in BF and BV between scans were found between the two patient groups p 0.19 and p 0.06 for BF and BV respectively No significant rank correlations were found when comparing relative changes in DCE-CT parameters with relative change in tumour bulk Differing trends in the relative change of BF and BV between patients on treatment and on observation indicate the potential of DCE-CT for the assessment of pharmacodynamic endpoints with respect to treatment in MPM A future study with a larger patient cohort and unified treatment regimens should be undertaken to confirm the results of this pilot study CT-derived haemodynamic parameters show differing trends between malignant pleural patients on treatment and patients off treatment Changes in haemodynamic parameters do not correlate with changes in tumour bulk as measured according to the modified RECIST protocol Differing trends across the two patient groups indicate the potential sensitivity of DCE-CT to assess pharmacodynamic endpoints in the treatment of MPM,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1130, 1, 26, 2281, 45, 10, 6, 963, 3, 1207, 1, 42099, 1038, 526, 29, 2540, 748, 651, 1220, 872, 4228, 425, 1441, 4, 3, 455, 1, 770, 51, 6, 24, 4, 393, 2164, 3278, 7, 3, 69, 180, 159, 762, 7, 479, 56, 2, 365, 7, 23, 1664, 296, 69, 208, 100, 4228, 425, 1441, 4910, 20, 705, 18, 53, 3, 4228, 425, 1038, 1, 246, 315, 1412, 6139, 2, 246, 315, 433, 3835, 11, 683, 262, 3, 14463, 5903, 770, 313, 580, 400, 4, 770, 4228, 425, 1038, 59, 1441, 11, 72, 59, 3, 23, 24, 2, 23, 1664, 736, 4228, 425, 4219, 400, 11, 438, 5, 580, 707, 4, 770, 5821, 194, 768, 6, 3, 1230, 1834, 1182, 5276, 1963, 4, 580, 707, 4, 6139, 2, 3835, 59, 1441, 11, 204, 59, 3, 100, 69, 271, 19, 13, 326, 2, 19, 13, 1460, 9, 6139, 2, 3835, 106, 77, 93, 1026, 2553, 11, 204, 198, 1430, 580, 400, 4, 4228, 425, 1038, 5, 580, 707, 4, 770, 5821, 5276, 1963, 4, 3, 580, 707, 1, 6139, 2, 3835, 59, 7, 23, 24, 2, 23, 1664, 1008, 3, 174, 1, 4228, 425, 9, 3, 455, 1, 2424, 1387, 5, 2184, 6, 24, 4, 3278, 8, 508, 45, 5, 8, 1077, 69, 180, 2, 16453, 24, 472, 257, 40, 2789, 6, 1843, 3, 99, 1, 26, 2281, 45, 425, 526, 42099, 1038, 514, 5276, 1963, 59, 393, 2164, 7, 23, 24, 2, 7, 1889, 24, 400, 4, 42099, 1038, 1022, 44, 1513, 5, 400, 4, 770, 5821, 22, 644, 768, 6, 3, 1230, 1834, 1182, 5276, 1963, 716, 3, 100, 69, 271, 1008, 3, 174, 485, 1, 4228, 425, 6, 423, 2424, 1387, 4, 3, 24, 1, 3278]",1855.0,29967955,102

Twenty-four germline mutations were identified in 13 genes in 23 (12%) of 198 patients. BAP1 mutations were the most common (n = 6; 25%). The remaining were in genes involved in DNA damage sensing and repair (n = 14), oxygen sensing (n = 2), endosome trafficking (n = 1), and cell growth (n = 1).

Post-transcriptional regulation of PIAS3 expression by miR-18a in malignant mesothelioma.,Molecular oncology,Mol Oncol,2018-10-23,"Protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (PIAS3) is an endogenous suppressor of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. By directly interacting with phosphorylated STAT3, PIAS3 can block the downstream transcriptional activity of STAT3, which is hyper-activated in various cancers. We previously reported that in malignant mesothelioma (MM), low PIAS3 expression is associated with increased STAT3 activation and correlates with poor patient survival, yet the regulatory mechanism(s) governing PIAS3 expression in MM remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that PIAS3 protein expression does not correlate with its mRNA level in MM cell lines, indicating that PIAS3 expression is regulated at a post-transcriptional level. Inhibition of proteasomal degradation with MG132 (10 μm) or bortezomib (1 μm), alone and in combination, did not increase PIAS3 protein levels; furthermore, inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide treatment did not decrease PIAS3 levels within 48 h, suggesting that PIAS3 expression is not actively regulated at a post-translational level. To determine whether miRNA (miRs) can translationally regulate PIAS3 expression, we combined miR microarray analysis with bioinformatic screening to identify candidate miRs, in MM cell lines with low PIAS3 expression, followed by luciferase reporter assays to validate miR regulation of the PIAS3 3'UTR.

Microsatellite Instability Is Associated With the Presence of Lynch Syndrome Pan-Cancer.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2018-10-30,"Microsatellite instability (MSI) and/or mismatch repair deficiency (MMR-D) testing has traditionally been performed in patients with colorectal (CRC) and endometrial cancer (EC) to screen for Lynch syndrome (LS)-associated cancer predisposition. The recent success of immunotherapy in high-frequency MSI (MSI-H) and/or MMR-D tumors now supports testing for MSI in all advanced solid tumors. The extent to which LS accounts for MSI-H across heterogeneous tumor types is unknown. Here, we establish the prevalence of LS across solid tumors according to MSI status. MSI status was determined using targeted next-generation sequencing, with tumors classified as MSI-H, MSI-indeterminate, or microsatellite-stable. Matched germline DNA was analyzed for mutations in LS-associated mismatch repair genes ( MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, EPCAM). In patients with LS with MSI-H/I tumors, immunohistochemical staining for MMR-D was assessed. Among 15,045 unique patients (more than 50 cancer types), LS was identified in 16.3% (53 of 326), 1.9% (13 of 699), and 0.3% (37 of 14,020) of patients with MSI-H, MSI-indeterminate, and microsatellite-stable tumors, respectively ( P < .001). Among patients with LS with MSI-H/I tumors, 50% (33 of 66) had tumors other than CRC/EC, including urothelial, prostate, pancreas, adrenocortical, small bowel, sarcoma, mesothelioma, melanoma, gastric, and germ cell tumors. In these patients with non-CRC/EC tumors, 45% (15 of 33) did not meet LS genetic testing criteria on the basis of personal/family history.

Efficacy and Safety of Avelumab Treatment in Patients With Advanced Unresectable Mesothelioma: Phase 1b Results From the JAVELIN Solid Tumor Trial.,JAMA oncology,JAMA Oncol,2019-03-01,"Patients with malignant mesothelioma whose disease has progressed after platinum and pemetrexed treatment have limited options. Anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) antibodies have antitumor activity in this disease, but little is known about the activity of anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies in patients with mesothelioma. To assess the efficacy and safety of avelumab in a cohort of patients with previously treated mesothelioma. Phase 1b open-label study (JAVELIN Solid Tumor) in patients with unresectable mesothelioma that progressed after platinum and pemetrexed treatment, enrolled at 25 sites in 3 countries between September 9, 2014, and July 22, 2015. Participants received avelumab, 10 mg/kg, every 2 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or withdrawal from the study. Prespecified end points included confirmed best overall response based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors, version 1.1; duration of response; progression-free survival (PFS); overall survival (OS); PD-L1 expression-based analyses; and safety. Of 53 patients treated with avelumab, the median age was 67 (range, 32-84) years; 32 (60%) were male. As of December 31, 2016, median follow-up was 24.8 (range, 16.8-27.8) months. Twenty patients (38%) had 3 or more previous lines of therapy (median, 2; range, 1-8). The confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 9% (5 patients; 95% CI, 3.1%-20.7%), with complete response in 1 patient and partial response in 4 patients. Responses were durable (median, 15.2 months; 95% CI, 11.1 to not estimable months) and occurred in patients with PD-L1-positive tumors (3 of 16; ORR, 19%; 95% CI, 4.0%-45.6%) and PD-L1-negative tumors (2 of 27; ORR, 7%; 95% CI, 0.9%-24.3%) based on a 5% or greater PD-L1 cutoff. Disease control rate was 58% (31 patients). Median PFS was 4.1 (95% CI, 1.4-6.2) months, and the 12-month PFS rate was 17.4% (95% CI, 7.7%-30.4%). Median OS was 10.7 (95% CI, 6.4-20.2) months, and the median 12-month OS rate was 43.8% (95% CI, 29.8%-57.0%). Five patients (9%) had a grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse event, and 3 (6%) had a grade 3 or 4 immune-related, treatment-related adverse event. There were no treatment-related deaths. Avelumab showed durable antitumor activity and disease control with an acceptable safety profile in a heavily pretreated cohort of patients with mesothelioma.
