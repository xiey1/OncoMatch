Distinct PTEN mutational spectra in hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer syndrome-related endometrial carcinomas compared to sporadic microsatellite unstable tumors.,Human molecular genetics,Hum. Mol. Genet.,2002-02-01,"Germline PTEN mutations cause Cowden syndrome (CS) and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRR), two hamartoma-tumor syndromes with an increased risk of breast, thyroid and endometrial cancers. Somatic genetic and epigenetic inactivation of PTEN is involved in as high as 93% of sporadic endometrial carcinomas (EC), irrespective of microsatellite status, and can occur in the earliest precancers. EC is the most frequent extra-colonic cancer in patients with hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer syndrome (HNPCC), characterized by germline mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes and by microsatellite instability (MSI) in component tumors. To determine whether PTEN is involved in the pathogenesis of EC arising in HNPCC cases, and whether PTEN inactivation precedes MMR deficiency, we obtained 41 ECs from 29 MLH1 or MSH2 mutation positive HNPCC families and subjected them to PTEN expression and mutation analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed 68% (28/41) of the HNPCC-related ECs with absent or weak PTEN expression. The remaining 27% (11/41) of tumors had normal expression and 5% (2/41) with mixed populations showing weak/absent as well as normal expression. Mutation analysis of 20 aberrant PTEN-expressing tumors revealed that 17 (85%) harbored 18 somatic PTEN mutations. All mutations were frameshift, 10 (56%) of which involved the 6(A) tracts in exon 7 or 8. These results suggest that PTEN plays a significant pathogenic role in both HNPCC and sporadic endometrial carcinogenesis, unlike the scenarios for colorectal cancer. Furthermore, we have shown that somatic PTEN mutation, especially frameshift, is a consequence of profound MMR deficiency in HNPCC-related ECs. In contrast, among 60 previously reported MSI+ sporadic ECs with 70 somatic mutations in PTEN, 39 (56%) were frameshift, of which only eight (21%) were affecting the 6(A) tracts in exon 7 or 8 (P = 0.01), suggesting that PTEN mutations may precede MMR deficiency.",Journal Article,6563.0,59.0,Germline PTEN mutations cause Cowden syndrome CS and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome BRR two hamartoma-tumor syndromes with an increased risk of and cancers Somatic genetic and epigenetic inactivation of PTEN is involved in as high as 93 of sporadic carcinomas EC irrespective of microsatellite status and can occur in the earliest precancers EC is the most frequent extra-colonic cancer in patients with hereditary non-polyposis cancer syndrome HNPCC characterized by germline mutations in the mismatch repair MMR genes and by microsatellite instability MSI in component tumors To determine whether PTEN is involved in the pathogenesis of EC arising in HNPCC cases and whether PTEN inactivation precedes MMR deficiency we obtained 41 ECs from 29 MLH1 or MSH2 mutation positive HNPCC families and subjected them to PTEN expression and mutation analysis Immunohistochemical analysis revealed 68 28/41 of the HNPCC-related ECs with absent or weak PTEN expression The remaining 27 11/41 of tumors had normal expression and 5 2/41 with mixed populations showing weak/absent as well as normal expression Mutation analysis of 20 aberrant PTEN-expressing tumors revealed that 17 85 harbored 18 somatic PTEN mutations All mutations were frameshift 10 56 of which involved the 6 A tracts in exon 7 or 8 These results suggest that PTEN plays a significant pathogenic role in both HNPCC and sporadic carcinogenesis unlike the scenarios for cancer Furthermore we have shown that somatic PTEN mutation especially frameshift is a consequence of profound MMR deficiency in HNPCC-related ECs In contrast among 60 previously reported MSI+ sporadic ECs with 70 somatic mutations in PTEN 39 56 were frameshift of which only eight 21 were affecting the 6 A tracts in exon 7 or 8 P 0.01 suggesting that PTEN mutations may precede MMR deficiency,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[1009, 820, 138, 708, 5561, 681, 2188, 2, 12484, 12485, 12486, 681, 33184, 100, 8025, 30, 2040, 5, 35, 101, 43, 1, 2, 163, 1119, 336, 2, 1418, 2297, 1, 820, 16, 646, 4, 22, 64, 22, 966, 1, 1928, 826, 2180, 3500, 1, 2226, 156, 2, 122, 1271, 4, 3, 6995, 18753, 2180, 16, 3, 96, 908, 3420, 3663, 12, 4, 7, 5, 2305, 220, 4198, 12, 681, 6232, 765, 20, 1009, 138, 4, 3, 2617, 972, 2205, 214, 2, 20, 2226, 1753, 1494, 4, 1249, 57, 6, 223, 317, 820, 16, 646, 4, 3, 1384, 1, 2180, 2635, 4, 6232, 140, 2, 317, 820, 2297, 20146, 2205, 2299, 21, 683, 605, 5861, 29, 462, 3321, 15, 4272, 258, 109, 6232, 1954, 2, 4325, 1370, 6, 820, 55, 2, 258, 65, 1382, 65, 553, 806, 339, 605, 1, 3, 6232, 139, 5861, 5, 3269, 15, 4241, 820, 55, 3, 1844, 428, 175, 605, 1, 57, 42, 295, 55, 2, 33, 18, 605, 5, 1739, 1184, 2069, 4241, 3269, 22, 149, 22, 295, 55, 258, 65, 1, 179, 1898, 820, 1046, 57, 553, 17, 269, 772, 3253, 203, 1119, 820, 138, 62, 138, 11, 9425, 79, 664, 1, 92, 646, 3, 49, 8, 10950, 4, 1725, 67, 15, 66, 46, 99, 309, 17, 820, 1698, 8, 93, 2806, 200, 4, 110, 6232, 2, 1928, 1719, 4246, 3, 3964, 9, 12, 798, 21, 47, 443, 17, 1119, 820, 258, 1093, 9425, 16, 8, 4177, 1, 4399, 2205, 2299, 4, 6232, 139, 5861, 4, 748, 107, 335, 373, 210, 1494, 1928, 5861, 5, 431, 1119, 138, 4, 820, 587, 664, 11, 9425, 1, 92, 158, 659, 239, 11, 2319, 3, 49, 8, 10950, 4, 1725, 67, 15, 66, 19, 13, 355, 802, 17, 820, 138, 68, 14074, 2205, 2299]",1825.0,11854177,125
Protean PTEN: form and function.,American journal of human genetics,Am. J. Hum. Genet.,2002-03-01,"Germline mutations distributed across the PTEN tumor-suppressor gene have been found to result in a wide spectrum of phenotypic features. Originally shown to be a major susceptibility gene for both Cowden syndrome (CS), which is characterized by multiple hamartomas and an increased risk of breast, thyroid, and endometrial cancers, and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, which is characterized by lipomatosis, macrocephaly, and speckled penis, the PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome spectrum has broadened to include Proteus syndrome and Proteus-like syndromes. Exon 5, which encodes the core motif, is a hotspot for mutations likely due to the biology of the protein. PTEN is a major lipid 3-phosphatase, which signals down the PI3 kinase/AKT pro-apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, PTEN is a protein phosphatase, with the ability to dephosphorylate both serine and threonine residues. The protein-phosphatase activity has also been shown to regulate various cell-survival pathways, such as the mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) pathway. Although it is well established that PTEN's lipid-phosphatase activity, via the PI3K/AKT pathway, mediates growth suppression, there is accumulating evidence that the protein-phosphatase/MAPK pathway is equally important in the mediation of growth arrest and other crucial cellular functions.",Journal Article,6535.0,378.0,Germline mutations distributed across the PTEN tumor-suppressor gene have been found to result in a wide spectrum of phenotypic features Originally shown to be a major susceptibility gene for both Cowden syndrome CS which is characterized by multiple hamartomas and an increased risk of and cancers and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome which is characterized by lipomatosis macrocephaly and speckled penis the PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome spectrum has broadened to include Proteus syndrome and Proteus-like syndromes Exon 5 which encodes the core motif is a hotspot for mutations likely due to the biology of the protein PTEN is a major lipid 3-phosphatase which signals down the PI3 kinase/AKT pro-apoptotic pathway Furthermore PTEN is a protein phosphatase with the ability to dephosphorylate both serine and threonine residues The protein-phosphatase activity has also been shown to regulate various cell-survival pathways such as the mitogen-activated kinase MAPK pathway Although it is well established that PTEN 's lipid-phosphatase activity via the PI3K/AKT pathway mediates growth suppression there is accumulating evidence that the protein-phosphatase/MAPK pathway is equally important in the mediation of growth arrest and other crucial cellular functions,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[1009, 138, 4737, 716, 3, 820, 30, 1245, 145, 47, 85, 204, 6, 757, 4, 8, 1019, 1873, 1, 3290, 404, 5045, 443, 6, 40, 8, 458, 1432, 145, 9, 110, 5561, 681, 2188, 92, 16, 765, 20, 232, 15473, 2, 35, 101, 43, 1, 2, 163, 2, 12484, 12485, 12486, 681, 92, 16, 765, 20, 33192, 15835, 2, 33193, 10954, 3, 820, 8025, 30, 681, 1873, 71, 16626, 6, 643, 14078, 681, 2, 14078, 733, 2040, 1725, 33, 92, 4322, 3, 1793, 5298, 16, 8, 5991, 9, 138, 322, 520, 6, 3, 891, 1, 3, 178, 820, 16, 8, 458, 3121, 27, 2577, 92, 2312, 1328, 3, 6892, 216, 649, 1805, 1631, 308, 798, 820, 16, 8, 178, 2577, 5, 3, 801, 6, 21952, 110, 3734, 2, 5131, 6418, 3, 178, 2577, 128, 71, 120, 85, 443, 6, 2288, 747, 31, 25, 460, 225, 22, 3, 2625, 735, 216, 1748, 308, 242, 192, 16, 149, 635, 17, 820, 292, 3121, 2577, 128, 847, 3, 974, 649, 308, 3961, 129, 1332, 125, 16, 6233, 241, 17, 3, 178, 2577, 1748, 308, 16, 4142, 305, 4, 3, 13484, 1, 129, 1854, 2, 127, 2653, 763, 1681]",1267.0,11875759,151
Nuclear PTEN expression and clinicopathologic features in a population-based series of primary cutaneous melanoma.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2002-05-01,"Germline mutations of the PTEN tumor-suppressor gene, on 10q23, cause Cowden syndrome, an inherited hamartoma syndrome with a high risk of breast, thyroid and endometrial carcinomas and, some suggest, melanoma. To date, most studies which strongly implicate PTEN in the etiology of sporadic melanomas have depended on cell lines, short-term tumor cultures and noncultured metastatic melanomas. The only study which reports PTEN protein expression in melanoma focuses on cytoplasmic expression, mainly in metastatic samples. To determine how PTEN contributes to the etiology or the progression of primary cutaneous melanoma, we examined cytoplasmic and nuclear PTEN expression against clinical and pathologic features in a population-based sample of 150 individuals with incident primary cutaneous melanoma. Among 92 evaluable samples, 30 had no or decreased cytoplasmic PTEN protein expression and the remaining 62 had normal PTEN expression. In contrast, 84 tumors had no or decreased nuclear expression and 8 had normal nuclear PTEN expression. None of the clinical features studied, such as Clark's level and Breslow thickness or sun exposure, were associated with cytoplasmic PTEN expressional levels. An association with loss of nuclear PTEN expression was indicated for anatomical site (p = 0.06) and mitotic index (p = 0.02). There was also an association for melanomas to either not express nuclear PTEN or to express p53 alone, rather than both simultaneously (p = 0.02). In contrast with metastatic melanoma, where we have shown previously that almost two-thirds of tumors have some PTEN inactivation, only one-third of primary melanomas had PTEN silencing. This suggests that PTEN inactivation is a late event likely related to melanoma progression rather than initiation. Taken together with our previous observations in thyroid and islet cell tumors, our data suggest that nuclear-cytoplasmic partitioning of PTEN might also play a role in melanoma progression.",Comparative Study,6474.0,144.0,Germline mutations of the PTEN tumor-suppressor gene on 10q23 cause Cowden syndrome an inherited hamartoma syndrome with a high risk of and carcinomas and some suggest To date most studies which strongly implicate PTEN in the etiology of sporadic melanomas have depended on cell lines short-term tumor cultures and noncultured metastatic melanomas The only study which reports PTEN protein expression in focuses on cytoplasmic expression mainly in metastatic samples To determine how PTEN contributes to the etiology or the progression of primary cutaneous we examined cytoplasmic and nuclear PTEN expression against clinical and pathologic features in a population-based sample of 150 individuals with incident primary cutaneous Among 92 evaluable samples 30 had no or decreased cytoplasmic PTEN protein expression and the remaining 62 had normal PTEN expression In contrast 84 tumors had no or decreased nuclear expression and 8 had normal nuclear PTEN expression None of the clinical features studied such as Clark 's level and Breslow thickness or sun exposure were associated with cytoplasmic PTEN expressional levels An association with loss of nuclear PTEN expression was indicated for anatomical site p 0.06 and mitotic index p 0.02 There was also an association for melanomas to either not express nuclear PTEN or to express p53 alone rather than both simultaneously p 0.02 In contrast with metastatic where we have shown previously that almost two-thirds of tumors have some PTEN inactivation only one-third of primary melanomas had PTEN silencing This suggests that PTEN inactivation is a late event likely related to progression rather than initiation Taken together with our previous observations in and islet cell tumors our data suggest that nuclear-cytoplasmic partitioning of PTEN might also play a role in progression,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[1009, 138, 1, 3, 820, 30, 1245, 145, 23, 13783, 708, 5561, 681, 35, 2986, 8025, 681, 5, 8, 64, 43, 1, 2, 826, 2, 476, 309, 6, 1244, 96, 94, 92, 1327, 5545, 820, 4, 3, 2855, 1, 1928, 1965, 47, 9020, 23, 31, 285, 978, 337, 30, 3231, 2, 37133, 113, 1965, 3, 158, 45, 92, 1198, 820, 178, 55, 4, 3026, 23, 2828, 55, 2615, 4, 113, 347, 6, 223, 832, 820, 2444, 6, 3, 2855, 15, 3, 91, 1, 86, 1486, 21, 409, 2828, 2, 928, 820, 55, 480, 38, 2, 510, 404, 4, 8, 266, 90, 1000, 1, 1577, 869, 5, 2631, 86, 1486, 107, 937, 859, 347, 201, 42, 77, 15, 340, 2828, 820, 178, 55, 2, 3, 1844, 744, 42, 295, 820, 55, 4, 748, 874, 57, 42, 77, 15, 340, 928, 55, 2, 66, 42, 295, 928, 820, 55, 1292, 1, 3, 38, 404, 656, 225, 22, 11743, 292, 301, 2, 6931, 2903, 15, 5479, 645, 11, 41, 5, 2828, 820, 14750, 148, 35, 248, 5, 407, 1, 928, 820, 55, 10, 1103, 9, 5024, 606, 19, 13, 1460, 2, 2346, 558, 19, 13, 588, 125, 10, 120, 35, 248, 9, 1965, 6, 361, 44, 1669, 928, 820, 15, 6, 1669, 624, 279, 1832, 76, 110, 3074, 19, 13, 588, 4, 748, 5, 113, 1257, 21, 47, 443, 373, 17, 2214, 100, 5438, 1, 57, 47, 476, 820, 2297, 158, 104, 1282, 1, 86, 1965, 42, 820, 2077, 26, 844, 17, 820, 2297, 16, 8, 807, 774, 322, 139, 6, 91, 1832, 76, 1118, 1633, 1162, 5, 114, 698, 2172, 4, 2, 7475, 31, 57, 114, 74, 309, 17, 928, 2828, 4515, 1, 820, 822, 120, 1343, 8, 200, 4, 91]",1835.0,11948493,65
Gastrointestinal manifestations of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2002-05-01,"To determine the clinical features, natural history, and role of surgery for gastrointestinal manifestations of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) syndromes. The MEN 2 syndromes are characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma and other endocrinopathies. In addition, some patients with MEN 2A develop Hirschsprung's disease (HD), and all patients with MEN 2B have intestinal neuromas and megacolon that can cause significant gastrointestinal problems. From 83 families with MEN 2A, eight patients with HD were identified (MEN 2A-HD). These and all patients with MEN 2B followed at the authors' institution (n = 53) were sent questionnaires to describe the onset and type of gastrointestinal symptoms and treatment they had before the diagnosis of MEN 2. Records of all patients responding were reviewed, including radiographic imaging, histology, surgical records, and genetic testing. Thirty-six of the 61 patients (59%) responded (MEN 2A = 8, MEN 2B = 28) to the questionnaires. All patients with MEN 2A-HD were operated on for HD 2 to 63 years before being diagnosed with MEN 2. All patients responding were underweight as infants and had symptoms of abdominal pain, distention, and constipation. Eighty-eight percent had hematochezia, 63% had emesis, and 33% had intermittent diarrhea before surgery. All patients with MEN 2A-HD had rectal biopsies with a diverting colostomy as the initial surgical procedure. This was followed by a colostomy takedown and pull-through procedure at a later interval. Ninety-three percent of patients with MEN 2B had gastrointestinal symptoms 1 to 24 years before the diagnosis of MEN 2. Symptoms included flatulence (86%), abdominal distention or being underweight as a child (64%), abdominal pain (54%), constipation or diarrhea (43%), difficulty swallowing (39%), and vomiting (14%).

A 39-bp deletion polymorphism in PTEN in African American individuals: implications for molecular diagnostic testing.,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,J Mol Diagn,2002-05-01,"Germline mutations in the PTEN/MMAC1/TEP1 tumor suppressor gene cause Cowden syndrome (CS), a hereditary hamartoma-tumor syndrome with an increased risk of breast, thyroid, and endometrial cancers, and seemingly unrelated developmental disorders, such as Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba (BRR) syndrome, Proteus, and Proteus-like syndromes. Data to date suggest that irrespective of the clinical presentation, the identification of a PTEN mutation should trigger medical management which includes cancer surveillance. Clinic-based molecular diagnostic testing for germline PTEN mutations has been available for at least 2 years. This study reports on the finding of a previously unobserved heterozygous alteration (IVS7-15-->53del39) found in an African American individual who had features of CS. Further investigation revealed that 12 of 42 (28.6%) African American controls, but not individuals of Caucasian or Japanese origin, also carried this heterozygous 39-bp deletion in PTEN.

Low incidence of second neoplasms among children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia after 1983.,Blood,Blood,2002-06-01,"Second malignant neoplasms are a serious complication after successful treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). With improvement in survival, it is important to assess the impact of contemporary risk-based therapies on second neoplasms in ALL survivors. A cohort of 8831 children diagnosed with ALL and enrolled on Children's Cancer Group therapeutic protocols between 1983 and 1995 were observed to determine the incidence of second neoplasms and associated risk factors. The median age at diagnosis of ALL was 4.7 years. The cohort had accrued 54 883 person-years of follow-up. Sixty-three patients developed second neoplasms, including solid, nonhematopoietic tumors (n = 39: brain tumors n = 19, other solid tumors n = 20), myeloid leukemia or myelodysplasia (n = 16), and lymphoma (n = 8). The cumulative incidence of any second neoplasm was 1.18% at 10 years (95% confidence interval, 0.8%-1.5%), representing a 7.2-fold increased risk compared with the general population. The risk was increased significantly for acute myeloid leukemia (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 52.3), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR 8.3), parotid gland tumors (SIR 33.4), thyroid cancer (SIR 13.3), brain tumors (SIR 10.1), and soft tissue sarcoma (SIR 9.1). Multivariate analysis revealed female sex (relative risk [RR] 1.8), radiation to the craniospinal axis (RR 1.6), and relapse of primary disease (RR 3.5) to be independently associated with increased risk of all second neoplasms. Risk of second neoplasms increased with radiation dose (1800 cGy RR 1.5; 2400 cGy RR 3.9). Actuarial survival at 10 years from diagnosis of second neoplasms was 39%. Follow-up of this large cohort that was treated with contemporary risk-based therapy showed that the incidence of second neoplasms remains low after diagnosis of childhood ALL.",Clinical Trial,6443.0,159.0,Second malignant neoplasms are a serious complication after successful treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic ALL With improvement in survival it is important to assess the impact of contemporary risk-based therapies on second neoplasms in ALL survivors A cohort of 8831 children diagnosed with ALL and enrolled on Children 's Cancer Group therapeutic protocols between 1983 and 1995 were observed to determine the incidence of second neoplasms and associated risk factors The median age at diagnosis of ALL was 4.7 years The cohort had accrued 54 883 person-years of follow-up Sixty-three patients developed second neoplasms including solid nonhematopoietic tumors n 39 brain tumors n 19 other solid tumors n 20 myeloid or myelodysplasia n 16 and n 8 The cumulative incidence of any second neoplasm was 1.18 at 10 years 95 confidence interval 0.8 -1.5 representing a 7.2-fold increased risk compared with the general population The risk was increased significantly for acute myeloid standardized incidence ratio SIR 52.3 SIR 8.3 parotid gland tumors SIR 33.4 cancer SIR 13.3 brain tumors SIR 10.1 and soft tissue SIR 9.1 Multivariate analysis revealed female sex relative risk RR 1.8 radiation to the craniospinal axis RR 1.6 and relapse of primary disease RR 3.5 to be independently associated with increased risk of all second neoplasms Risk of second neoplasms increased with radiation dose 1800 cGy RR 1.5 2400 cGy RR 3.9 Actuarial survival at 10 years from diagnosis of second neoplasms was 39 Follow-up of this large cohort that was treated with contemporary risk-based therapy showed that the incidence of second neoplasms remains low after diagnosis of childhood ALL,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[419, 393, 1179, 32, 8, 1762, 1447, 50, 1401, 24, 1, 864, 286, 1275, 62, 5, 767, 4, 25, 192, 16, 305, 6, 423, 3, 345, 1, 2667, 43, 90, 235, 23, 419, 1179, 4, 62, 332, 8, 180, 1, 52933, 541, 265, 5, 62, 2, 346, 23, 541, 292, 12, 87, 189, 2189, 59, 6656, 2, 2323, 11, 164, 6, 223, 3, 287, 1, 419, 1179, 2, 41, 43, 130, 3, 52, 89, 28, 147, 1, 62, 10, 39, 67, 60, 3, 180, 42, 3198, 667, 14748, 2719, 60, 1, 166, 126, 1746, 169, 7, 276, 419, 1179, 141, 537, 19463, 57, 78, 587, 342, 57, 78, 326, 127, 537, 57, 78, 179, 533, 15, 6128, 78, 245, 2, 78, 66, 3, 967, 287, 1, 500, 419, 2131, 10, 14, 203, 28, 79, 60, 48, 307, 268, 13, 66, 14, 33, 2861, 8, 67, 18, 1116, 101, 43, 72, 5, 3, 1083, 266, 3, 43, 10, 101, 97, 9, 286, 533, 1670, 287, 197, 3636, 653, 27, 3636, 66, 27, 5838, 2326, 57, 3636, 466, 39, 12, 3636, 233, 27, 342, 57, 3636, 79, 14, 2, 1214, 246, 3636, 83, 14, 331, 65, 553, 1061, 1035, 580, 43, 861, 14, 66, 121, 6, 3, 5748, 2310, 861, 14, 49, 2, 429, 1, 86, 34, 861, 27, 33, 6, 40, 1042, 41, 5, 101, 43, 1, 62, 419, 1179, 43, 1, 419, 1179, 101, 5, 121, 61, 13507, 3071, 861, 14, 33, 12518, 3071, 861, 27, 83, 2361, 25, 28, 79, 60, 29, 147, 1, 419, 1179, 10, 587, 166, 126, 1, 26, 375, 180, 17, 10, 73, 5, 2667, 43, 90, 36, 224, 17, 3, 287, 1, 419, 1179, 469, 154, 50, 147, 1, 864, 62]",1679.0,12036851,162
Pitfalls of intraoperative quick parathyroid hormone monitoring and gamma probe localization in surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism.,"Archives of surgery (Chicago, Ill. : 1960)",Arch Surg,2002-06-01,"Intraoperative quick parathyroid hormone (qPTH) monitoring and gamma probe (GP) localization greatly aid the surgeon. Prospective case series of patients undergoing parathyroidectomy (PTX) with preoperative localization studies, operative data (including intraoperative qPTH values and GP localization), and outcomes. Follow-up was complete (mean, 4.2 months). University teaching hospital. We studied 57 consecutive patients with primary hyperparathyroidism from December 1, 1999, through November 30, 2000. Of these, 51 underwent first-time PTX, and 6, reoperative PTX (rePTX). Cure rate and morbidity after PTX or rePTX; sensitivity and accuracy of preoperative localization studies; prediction of cure from results of qPTH monitoring (comparing Nichols [>50% fall from the highest baseline level and lower than the lowest baseline] or normal-limit [>50% fall from first baseline level and lower than upper limit of the reference range] criteria); and value of GP localization. Patients were cured in 50 (98%) of 51 PTX and 6 (100%) of 6 rePTX for single adenomas (n = 49), double adenomas (n = 4), and multigland hyperplasia (n = 3). Nichols criteria for qPTH monitoring correctly categorized 45 (92%) of 49 cured single adenomas 10 minutes after excision. Only 35 (71%) of these adenomas were correctly categorized as cured by means of the normal-limit criteria. In double adenomas, both sets of criteria in the 10-minute samples indicated unresected glands in only 2 of 4 cases. Preoperative sestamibi parathyroid scans correctly localized 38 (76%) of 50 single adenomas. The GP was used in 54 of 57 cases. All adenomas measured greater than 20% of background ex vivo, but 6 thyroid nodules also measured greater than 20% ex vivo. In double adenomas, the GP helped locate the second adenoma in only 1 of 4 cases. The GP was graded as crucial in 2 cases with dense scar (both rePTX), helpful in 12 (22%) of 54 cases (particularly in retroesophageal glands), confirmatory in 32 (59%), and not helpful in 8 (15%). The GP helped localize 3 (43%) of 7 glands not seen on sestamibi parathyroid scans. Intraoperative qPTH monitoring confirmed cure in most cases.

We performed a Phase I trial to determine the maximum-tolerated dose, safety, and pharmacokinetic profile of CA4P on a single-dose i.v. schedule. We also obtained preliminary data on its effect on tumor blood flow using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) techniques and cell adhesion molecules at the higher-dose levels. Twenty-five assessable patients with advanced cancer received a total of 107 cycles over the following dose escalation schema: 18, 36, 60, 90 mg/m(2) as a 10-min infusion and 60 mg/m(2) as a 60-min infusion at 3-week intervals. There was no significant myelotoxicity, stomatitis, or alopecia. Tumor pain was a unique side effect, which occurred in 10% of cycles, and there were four episodes of dose-limiting toxicity at dosages > or =60 mg/m(2), including two episodes of acute coronary syndrome. Pharmacokinetics revealed rapid dephosphorylation of the parent compound (CA4P) to combretastatin A4 (CA4), with a short plasma half-life (approximately 30 min). A significant (P < 0.03) decline in gradient peak tumor blood flow by DCE-MRI in six of seven patients treated at 60 mg/m(2) was observed. A patient with anaplastic thyroid cancer had a complete response and is alive 30 months after treatment.

"Role of PTEN, a lipid phosphatase upstream effector of protein kinase B, in epithelial thyroid carcinogenesis.",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci.,2002-06-01,"Both benign and malignant thyroid disease are well-established components of Cowden syndrome (CS), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple hamartomas and breast cancer that may be considered a phakomatosis. The susceptibility gene for CS is PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene on 10q23.3 that encodes a lipid phosphatase that lies upstream of protein kinase B (Akt). Interestingly, Carney complex is also a phakomatosis where multiple endocrine neoplasias are prominent and thyroid cancer might be a rare component. One of its susceptibility genes is the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A. Over the course of the last four years, investigators have found the increasing clinical spectrum of syndromes characterized by germline loss-of-function PTEN mutation. In addition to CS, subsets of such disparate syndromes as Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, Proteus syndrome, and possibly VATER with hydrocephalus and megencephaly with autistic features have been found to have germline PTEN mutations. Paradoxically, somatic intragenic PTEN mutations were rare in uncultured primary epithelial thyroid tumors, although hemizygous deletion occurred in 10-20% of thyroid adenomas and carcinomas. However, with subsequent study, it was discovered that epigenetic silencing of PTEN and perhaps inappropriate subcellular compartmentalization were two novel mechanisms of PTEN inactivation pertinent in thyroid carcinogenesis.

Preirradiation endocrinopathies in pediatric brain tumor patients determined by dynamic tests of endocrine function.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2002-09-01,"To prospectively evaluate pediatric patients with localized primary brain tumors for evidence of endocrinopathy before radiotherapy (RT). Seventy-five pediatric patients were evaluated with the arginine tolerance test and L-dopa test for growth hormone secretory capacity and activity; thyroid-stimulating hormone surge and thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test for the hypothalamic-thyroid axis; the 1-microg adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) and metyrapone test for ACTH reserve; and, depending on age, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test to determine gonadotropin response. The study included 38 male and 37 female patients, age 1-21 years with ependymoma (n = 35), World Health Organization (WHO) Grade I-II astrocytoma (n = 18), WHO Grade III-IV astrocytoma (n = 10), craniopharyngioma (n = 7), optic pathway tumor (n = 4), and germinoma (n = 1). Seven patients receiving dexamethasone at the time of the evaluation were excluded from the final analysis. Of 68 assessable patient, 45 (66%) had evidence of endocrinopathy before RT, including 15 of 32 patients (47%) with posterior fossa tumors. Of the 45 patients, 38% had growth hormone deficiency, 43% had thyroid-stimulating hormone secretion abnormality, 22% had an abnormality in ACTH reserve, and 13% had an abnormality in age-dependent gonadotropin secretion. The incidence of pre-RT endocrinopathy in pediatric brain tumor patients is high, including patients with tumors not adjacent to the hypothalamic-pituitary unit. These data suggest an overestimation in the incidence of radiation-induced endocrinopathy. Baseline endocrine function should be determined for brain tumor patients before therapy. The potential for radiation-induced endocrinopathy alone cannot be used as an argument for alternatives to RT for most patients.

Silencing of the PTEN tumor-suppressor gene in anaplastic thyroid cancer.,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",Genes Chromosomes Cancer,2002-09-01,"Germline mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene PTEN (MMAC1, TEP1) are found in Cowden syndrome, which predisposes to hamartomas, breast cancer, trichilemmomas, and thyroid tumors of follicular epithelium. PTEN has also been found to be somatically deleted, mutated, and/or silenced in various sporadically occurring cancers such as glioblastoma, breast cancer, kidney cancer, malignant melanoma, and endometrial cancer. Loss or reduction of PTEN protein expression as well as inappropriate subcellular compartmentalization is seen in non-medullary thyroid cancers. However, although allelic loss of the PTEN locus in 10q23.3 is frequently seen, this is not coupled with mutations in the PTEN gene. To approach further the frequency and mechanism behind PTEN silencing, we screened a panel of 87 sporadic thyroid tumors for PTEN mRNA expression, including 14 anaplastic carcinomas, 37 follicular carcinomas, 21 atypical adenomas, and 15 ordinary adenomas. Complete loss of PTEN mRNA expression was evident in six of the tumors, including four anaplastic carcinomas, one widely invasive carcinoma, and one ordinary adenoma. The transcriptional silencing of PTEN was significantly associated with the anaplastic subtype, suggesting that PTEN is involved in the carcinogenesis of highly malignant or late-stage thyroid cancers, whereas this particular mechanism appears to be of minor importance in differentiated follicular thyroid tumors. No association was observed between the expression, loss of heterozygosity, and mutation status in the 33 cases in which these parameters were compared. This indicates that PTEN silencing is a result of a wide variety of epigenetic and/or structural silencing mechanisms rather than a consequence of structural biallelic inactivation of the classical type. Furthermore, the high rate of alterations in the 10q23 region might indicate the presence of an as-yet unknown tumor-suppressor gene with an important role in the development of thyroid tumors.",Comparative Study,6351.0,81.0,Germline mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene PTEN MMAC1 TEP1 are found in Cowden syndrome which predisposes to hamartomas cancer trichilemmomas and tumors of follicular epithelium PTEN has also been found to be somatically deleted mutated and/or silenced in various sporadically occurring cancers such as glioblastoma cancer cancer malignant and cancer Loss or reduction of PTEN protein expression as well as inappropriate subcellular compartmentalization is seen in non-medullary cancers However although allelic loss of the PTEN locus in 10q23.3 is frequently seen this is not coupled with mutations in the PTEN gene To approach further the frequency and mechanism behind PTEN silencing we screened a panel of 87 sporadic tumors for PTEN mRNA expression including 14 anaplastic carcinomas 37 follicular carcinomas 21 atypical adenomas and 15 ordinary adenomas Complete loss of PTEN mRNA expression was evident in six of the tumors including four anaplastic carcinomas one widely invasive carcinoma and one ordinary adenoma The transcriptional silencing of PTEN was significantly associated with the anaplastic subtype suggesting that PTEN is involved in the carcinogenesis of highly malignant or late-stage cancers whereas this particular mechanism appears to be of minor importance in differentiated follicular tumors No association was observed between the expression loss of heterozygosity and mutation status in the 33 cases in which these parameters were compared This indicates that PTEN silencing is a result of a wide variety of epigenetic and/or structural silencing mechanisms rather than a consequence of structural biallelic inactivation of the classical type Furthermore the high rate of alterations in the 10q23 region might indicate the presence of an as-yet unknown tumor-suppressor gene with an important role in the development of tumors,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[1009, 138, 4, 3, 30, 1245, 145, 820, 24446, 37157, 32, 204, 4, 5561, 681, 92, 10563, 6, 15473, 12, 43028, 2, 57, 1, 1974, 2781, 820, 71, 120, 85, 204, 6, 40, 12293, 4389, 1185, 2, 15, 5442, 4, 747, 15879, 1821, 163, 225, 22, 996, 12, 12, 393, 2, 12, 407, 15, 628, 1, 820, 178, 55, 22, 149, 22, 5148, 7153, 19477, 16, 527, 4, 220, 4564, 163, 137, 242, 3861, 407, 1, 3, 820, 2474, 4, 13783, 27, 16, 746, 527, 26, 16, 44, 3332, 5, 138, 4, 3, 820, 145, 6, 353, 195, 3, 675, 2, 670, 5219, 820, 2077, 21, 2261, 8, 993, 1, 912, 1928, 57, 9, 820, 956, 55, 141, 213, 1841, 826, 567, 1974, 826, 239, 1973, 2751, 2, 167, 19493, 2751, 236, 407, 1, 820, 956, 55, 10, 2853, 4, 437, 1, 3, 57, 141, 294, 1841, 826, 104, 1792, 416, 134, 2, 104, 19493, 2434, 3, 1431, 2077, 1, 820, 10, 97, 41, 5, 3, 1841, 875, 802, 17, 820, 16, 646, 4, 3, 1719, 1, 561, 393, 15, 807, 82, 163, 547, 26, 1454, 670, 1233, 6, 40, 1, 2278, 1187, 4, 1442, 1974, 57, 77, 248, 10, 164, 59, 3, 55, 407, 1, 3963, 2, 258, 156, 4, 3, 466, 140, 4, 92, 46, 1038, 11, 72, 26, 2640, 17, 820, 2077, 16, 8, 757, 1, 8, 1019, 1362, 1, 1418, 2, 15, 3281, 2077, 483, 1832, 76, 8, 4177, 1, 3281, 6435, 2297, 1, 3, 3781, 267, 798, 3, 64, 116, 1, 593, 4, 3, 13783, 1053, 822, 1008, 3, 463, 1, 35, 22, 1145, 860, 30, 1245, 145, 5, 35, 305, 200, 4, 3, 193, 1, 57]",1860.0,12203792,41
Childhood and adolescent thyroid carcinoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2002-08-01,"This analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of clinical and treatment factors on local tumor control, control of distant metastasis, survival, and complications in children and adolescents with thyroid carcinoma. The records of 56 children and adolescents with papillary and follicular carcinoma of the thyroid were reviewed. They ranged in age from 4 to 20 years. There were 43 females and 13 males. At diagnosis, 15 (27%) patients had disease confined to the thyroid, 34 (60%) had additional lymph node metastasis to the neck or upper mediastinum, and 7 (13%) also had lung metastasis. Treatment consisted of a total thyroidectomy in 48 patients, a subtotal thyroidectomy in 4 patients, and a lobectomy in 4 patients. All 56 patients received postoperative thyroid hormone suppressive therapy. (131)I was administered to 82% (46 of 56) of patients after their initial surgery. The overall survival rate was 98% with a follow-up of 0.6-30.7 years (with a median follow-up of 11.0 years). The one death that occurred in this patient population was the result of a congenital heart defect and was unrelated to thyroid carcinoma. The 10-year progression-free survival rate was 61%. Nineteen patients (34%) experienced a recurrence of their thyroid carcinoma. The time to first recurrence of disease ranged from 8 months to 14.8 years (mean, 5.3 years). None of those with disease confined to the thyroid developed recurrent disease. The recurrence rate was 50% (17 of 34) in patients with lymph node metastasis and 29% (2 of 7) in patients with lung metastasis (P = 0.02). Tumor characteristics were evaluated for time to first recurrence utilizing the logistic likelihood ratio test to predict disease recurrence. Thyroid capsule invasion (P = 0.02), soft tissue invasion (P = 0.03), positive margins (P = 0.006), and tumor location at diagnosis (thyroid only vs. thyroid and lymph nodes vs. thyroid, lymph nodes, and lung metastasis, P = 0.02) were significant for developing recurrent disease. Patients younger than 15 years old at diagnosis were more likely to have more extensive tumor at diagnosis than patients who were 15 years and older (thyroid only vs. thyroid and lymph nodes vs. thyroid, lymph nodes, and lung metastasis, P = 0.02).

Endocrine complications in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood reviews,Blood Rev.,2002-12-01,"Endocrine complications of therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are common and are potentially debilitating both during and after therapy. Growth velocity slows during therapy for ALL, especially during the first year; however, children who do not receive cranial irradiation usually reach normal adult height. While growth hormone deficiency generally occurs in patients who have received 24Gy of cranial irradiation, it may also develop in those treated with lower doses (18Gy) of cranial radiation or with only high-dose methotrexate. Obesity commonly occurs during therapy and persists after completion of therapy. Osteopenia can occur early during therapy for ALL and can persist for many years. Adrenal insufficiency should be suspected in any child who has recently received glucocorticoid therapy, and stress doses of steroid should be administered in the event of metabolic stress. Screening of urine is useful for early detection of hyperglycemia during therapy with glucocorticoids and L-asparaginase. The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone is usually associated with vincristine therapy and may be aggravated by concurrent use of azole antifungals.

A retrospective review of the effectiveness of recombinant human TSH as a preparation for radioiodine thyroid remnant ablation.,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",J. Nucl. Med.,2002-11-01,"Radioiodine remnant ablation (RRA) is frequently used after a thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma because it has been reported to reduce the number of local recurrences and to increase overall survival. Although the traditional method of preparation for RRA is thyroid hormone withdrawal, several physicians at our medical center have offered the option of having RRA after preparation by recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (thyrotropin; TSH) over the past 2 y. During this same time period, other patients at our center were prepared for RRA by hormone withdrawal. We took this opportunity to retrospectively review the rate of complete remnant ablation in patients having RRA after hormone withdrawal compared with those having RRA after recombinant human TSH. Only patients who had RRA after January 1, 1999, and follow-up diagnostic studies at our medical center, were included in the analysis. A successful ablation was defined as no visible radioiodine uptake on the follow-up diagnostic scans, performed with 185 MBq (5 mCi) (131)I. The 2 groups had comparable patient and tumor characteristics and received similar ablative activities of (131)I. We found that 84% of those prepared by recombinant human TSH, and 81% of those prepared by hormone withdrawal, had complete resolution of visible thyroid bed uptake after RRA (P = not significant). Given the biases that exist in retrospective studies, we cannot yet recommend RRA preparation by recombinant human TSH for routine use.

All patients had preoperative evidence of metastatic disease. In addition to the usual comprehensive node dissection encompassing all lymphatic tissue in levels II through V, level I nodes and level II nodes above the spinal accessory nerve were labeled as distinct regions in 16 (31%) and 34 (67%) specimens, respectively. Disease was confined to a single nodal level in 20 (39%) of 51 specimens and was present in 4 or more levels in 7 (14%) of 50 neck dissections. There was cancer at 2 or 3 levels in 16 (31%) and 15 (29%) cases, respectively. Seven (21%) of the 34 patients undergoing separate analysis of nodes from above the spinal accessory nerve had cancer there. In 3 of the 34 it was the sole disease in level II.

Phase I pharmacodynamic study of time and sequence dependency of hydroxyurea in combination with gemcitabine: a California Cancer Consortium Trial.,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol.,2002-09-12,"Preclinical studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that prior exposure to hydroxyurea increases the percentage of cells in S phase, enhancing the cytotoxicity of subsequent gemcitabine treatment in human oropharyngeal KB cells. To evaluate the clinical implications of this time- and sequence-dependent potentiation, we performed a phase I trial of hydroxyurea given over 24 h followed by a 30-min infusion of gemcitabine in weeks 1 and 2 of a 3-week cycle. The dose of hydroxyurea was fixed at 500 mg orally every 6 h for four doses starting 24 h before each dose of gemcitabine. The initial dose level of gemcitabine was 250 mg/m(2) on days 2 and 9, and this was escalated stepwise to 1000 mg/m(2) on days 2 and 9. Gemcitabine pharmacokinetics were determined on days 2 and 9 of the first cycle. Of 27 patients enrolled (12 female, 15 male), 24 were evaluable for response and 23 were evaluable for toxicity. Their median age was 56 years (range 27-76 years). Tumor types included lung, head and neck, pancreas, breast, colon, prostate, stomach, ovary, esophagus, germ cell, thyroid, gallbladder, and unknown primary. A total of 80 cycles of treatment were completed. One patient (unknown primary) had an objective partial response lasting 21 months, and 12 patients had stable disease. All observed dose-limiting toxicities were related to myelosuppression. The gemcitabine maximum tolerated dose was established at 750 mg/m(2) on days 2 and 9. Hydroxyurea had no effect on the plasma pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine. These results suggest that hydroxyurea followed by gemcitabine can be safely administered and has activity on this schedule.

A founding locus within the RET proto-oncogene may account for a large proportion of apparently sporadic Hirschsprung disease and a subset of cases of sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma.,American journal of human genetics,Am. J. Hum. Genet.,2002-12-09,"Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a common congenital disorder characterized by aganglionosis of the gut. The seemingly unrelated multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism. Yet, germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene are associated with both MEN 2 and HSCR. In the former, gain-of-function mutations in a limited set of codons is found, whereas, in the latter, loss-of-function mutations are found. However, germline RET mutation is associated with only 3% of a population-based series of isolated HSCR, and little is known about susceptibility to sporadic MTC. We have found previously that specific haplotypes comprising RET coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) comprising exon 2 SNP A45A were strongly associated with HSCR, whereas haplotypes associated with exon 14 SNP S836S were associated with MTC. In this study, we describe three novel intron 1 SNPs, and, together with the coding SNP haplotypes, the data suggest the presence of distinct ancestral haplotypes for HSCR and sporadic MTC in linkage disequilibrium with a putative founding susceptibility locus/loci. The data are consistent with the presence of a very ancient, low-penetrance founder locus approximately 20-30 kb upstream of SNP A45A, but the failure of the SNPs to span the locus presents challenges in modeling mode of transmission or ancestry. We postulate that this founding locus is germane to both isolated HSCR and MTC but also that different mutations in this locus would predispose to one or the other.",Journal Article,6252.0,91.0,Hirschsprung disease HSCR is a common congenital disorder characterized by aganglionosis of the gut The seemingly unrelated multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 MEN 2 is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by medullary carcinoma MTC and hyperparathyroidism Yet germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene are associated with both MEN 2 and HSCR In the former gain-of-function mutations in a limited set of codons is found whereas in the latter loss-of-function mutations are found However germline RET mutation is associated with only 3 of a population-based series of isolated HSCR and little is known about susceptibility to sporadic MTC We have found previously that specific haplotypes comprising RET coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs comprising exon 2 SNP A45A were strongly associated with HSCR whereas haplotypes associated with exon 14 SNP S836S were associated with MTC In this study we describe three novel intron 1 SNPs and together with the coding SNP haplotypes the data suggest the presence of distinct ancestral haplotypes for HSCR and sporadic MTC in linkage disequilibrium with a putative founding susceptibility locus/loci The data are consistent with the presence of a very ancient low-penetrance founder locus approximately 20-30 kb upstream of SNP A45A but the failure of the SNPs to span the locus presents challenges in modeling mode of transmission or ancestry We postulate that this founding locus is germane to both isolated HSCR and MTC but also that different mutations in this locus would predispose to one or the other,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[30234, 34, 18239, 16, 8, 186, 6711, 2645, 765, 20, 53286, 1, 3, 7600, 3, 11405, 2092, 232, 1293, 2298, 267, 18, 325, 18, 16, 35, 6084, 2156, 2645, 765, 20, 4564, 134, 3959, 2, 9630, 1145, 1009, 138, 4, 3, 2412, 4976, 1836, 32, 41, 5, 110, 325, 18, 2, 18239, 4, 3, 3623, 1803, 1, 343, 138, 4, 8, 383, 916, 1, 9107, 16, 204, 547, 4, 3, 3286, 407, 1, 343, 138, 32, 204, 137, 1009, 2412, 258, 16, 41, 5, 158, 27, 1, 8, 266, 90, 988, 1, 1355, 18239, 2, 1215, 16, 440, 545, 1432, 6, 1928, 3959, 21, 47, 204, 373, 17, 112, 5940, 3538, 2412, 3097, 226, 1579, 1203, 1109, 3538, 1725, 18, 1845, 30346, 11, 1327, 41, 5, 18239, 547, 5940, 41, 5, 1725, 213, 1845, 33342, 11, 41, 5, 3959, 4, 26, 45, 21, 897, 169, 229, 6259, 14, 1109, 2, 1162, 5, 3, 3097, 1845, 5940, 3, 74, 309, 3, 463, 1, 834, 15165, 5940, 9, 18239, 2, 1928, 3959, 4, 4820, 8459, 5, 8, 2743, 14148, 1432, 2474, 2012, 3, 74, 32, 925, 5, 3, 463, 1, 8, 923, 33343, 154, 4792, 7243, 2474, 705, 179, 201, 5116, 3988, 1, 1845, 30346, 84, 3, 496, 1, 3, 1109, 6, 7165, 3, 2474, 2740, 1427, 4, 2057, 4530, 1, 8151, 15, 3535, 21, 12071, 17, 26, 14148, 2474, 16, 24552, 6, 110, 1355, 18239, 2, 3959, 84, 120, 17, 338, 138, 4, 26, 2474, 688, 6043, 6, 104, 15, 3, 127]",1567.0,12474140,10
"Socioeconomic factors and the presentation, management, and outcome of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma.",Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2002-11-01,"To determine whether patients from disadvantaged socioeconomic groups present with more advanced thyroid carcinoma or experience differing management and clinical outcomes, we retrospectively reviewed the charts of 292 patients seen at MD Anderson Cancer Center and Ben Taub General Hospital between 1987 and 1994. At diagnosis, the mean age was 42 +/- 16 years, 78% of patients were female, 76% of patients were low risk (TNM stage I or II), and 22% high risk (stage III or IV). Neighborhood income (+/- standard error of the mean [SEM]) (1990 census data) was lower in the high-risk group compared with the low-risk group (US dollars 26200 +/- 1670 vs. US dollars 30900 +/- 870, p = 0.012). Men were more likely than women to present at an older age (47.5 +/- 16.7 vs. 40.2 +/- 16.0, p = 0.0014) and in the high-risk group (46% vs. 15%, p < 0.0001). No socioeconomic factor (ethnicity, marital status, occupation prestige, neighborhood income, insurance type) influenced initial diagnostic assessment. Similarly, no socioeconomic factor influenced initial disease management or the type of follow-up received over the 12-year period. Married patients had a lower 5-year recurrence rate than those unmarried (18% vs. 32%, p = 0.03); however, this did not affect overall or disease-specific survival. Similarly, ethnicity, marital status, occupation prestige, and insurance type did not influence overall or disease-specific survival.

"Evaluation of germline sequence variants of GFRA1, GFRA2, and GFRA3 genes in a cohort of Spanish patients with sporadic medullary thyroid cancer.",Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2002-11-01,"The etiology of sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma (sMTC) remains elusive. While germline gain-of-function mutations in the RET proto-oncogene cause hereditary MTC, somatic RET mutations have been described in a variable number of sMTC. So far, S836S of RET, is the only variant whose association with sMTC has been found in several European cohorts. Because RET variants seem to be associated with MTC, it is plausible that variants in genes encoding for RET coreceptors may play a role in the pathogenesis of sMTC. Recently, we described two possible low penetrance susceptibility alleles in the gene encoding RET coreceptor GFRalpha1, -193C > G and 537T > C, in a German series of sMTC. In this study, we have genotyped nine polymorphisms within GFRA1-3 genes for 51 Spanish sMTC, and 100 normal controls. Our results show that no statistical signification was found when Spanish sMTC patients were compared to controls. Taken together with the observations in the German sMTC series, the present findings suggest that GFRA1-193C > G and 537T > C could be in linkage disequilibrium with other loci responsible for the disease with a founder effect in Germany.

Thyroid carcinoma.,"Lancet (London, England)",Lancet,2003-02-01,"Thyroid carcinomas are fairly uncommon and include disease types that range from indolent localised papillary carcinomas to the fulminant and lethal anaplastic disease. Several attempts to formulate a consensus about treatment of thyroid carcinoma have resulted in published guidelines for diagnosis and initial disease management. Multimodality treatments are widely recommended, although there is little evidence from prospective trials to support this approach. Surgical resection to achieve local disease control remains the cornerstone of primary treatment for most thyroid cancers, and is often followed by adjuvant radioiodine treatment for papillary and follicular types of disease. Thyroid hormone replacement therapy is used not only to rectify postsurgical hypothyroidism, but also because there is evidence to suggest that high doses that suppress thyroid stimulating hormone prevent disease recurrence in patients with papillary or follicular carcinomas. Treatment for progressive metastatic disease is often of limited benefit, and there is a pressing need for novel approaches in treatment of patients at high risk of disease-related death. In families with inherited thyroid cancer syndromes, early diagnosis and intervention based on genetic testing might prevent poor disease outcomes.

Prognostic factors in patients with Hürthle cell neoplasms of the thyroid.,Cancer,Cancer,2003-03-01,"Hürthle cell neoplasms, often considered a variant of follicular thyroid neoplasms, represent 3% of thyroid carcinomas. Only a handful of publications have focused on the biologic behavior, prognostic factors, and treatment outcomes of Hürthle cell carcinoma. The objective of the current study was to identify the clinical and pathologic features of Hürthle cell carcinomas that predict disease progression or death. The authors reviewed medical records of patients who were treated for Hürthle cell carcinoma (HCC) and Hürthle cell adenoma (HCA) at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from March 1944 to February 1995, including follow-up information. The pathologic diagnosis was confirmed by one of the authors. The authors identified 127 patients with Hürthle cell neoplasms, 89 patients with HCC and 38 patients with HCA. Seven patients with HCC had foci of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Survival for this subgroup was worse compared with the overall group and was analyzed separately. The HCC group was significantly older (age 51.8 years vs. age 43.1. years) and had larger tumors (4.3 cm vs. 2.9 cm) compared with the HCA group. No differences were seen in gender or previous radiation exposure. Forty percent of patients in the HCC group died of thyroid carcinoma, whereas no patients in the HCA group died of the disease. There has been no improvement in all-cause and disease specific mortality in the past 5 decades for patients with these neoplasms. Conventional staging systems predicted mortality with minor differences. Of the patients with known metastasis, 38% showed radioiodine uptake. Univariate analysis identified older age, higher disease stage, tumor size, extraglandular invasion, multifocality, lymph node disease, distant metastasis, extensive surgery, external beam radiation therapy, and chemotherapy as factors that were associated with decreased survival. Tumor encapsulation was associated with improved survival. Although radioactive iodine treatment had no overall effect on survival, subgroup analysis showed that patients who received radioactive iodine for adjuvant ablation therapy had better outcomes compared either with patients who did not receive radioactive iodine or with patients who received radioactive iodine as treatment for residual disease. Multivariate analysis indicated that older age and larger tumor size predicted worse survival through an association with worse behaving tumors (multifocal, less encapsulated, and with extraglandular invasion). The decreased survival in patients with lymph node metastases may be explained by its association with distant metastases. The association of extensive surgery, external beam radiation therapy, and chemotherapy with worse survival also disappeared once those factors were analyzed together with other prognostic factors, such as distant metastases. Several clinical and pathologic prognostic factors were identified in patients with HCC and HCA. Older age and larger tumor size predicted reduced survival. Radioactive iodine therapy may confer a survival benefit when it is used for adjuvant ablation therapy, but not when residual disease is present.

"Etiology, diagnosis, and treatment recommendations for central hypothyroidism associated with bexarotene therapy for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.",Clinical lymphoma,Clin Lymphoma,2003-03-01,"Bexarotene is a synthetic retinoid X receptor (RXR)-selective retinoid recently approved for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. In clinical trials, bexarotene was found to cause severe central hypothyroidism with high frequency, associated with marked reductions in serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine. Further investigation demonstrated a novel mechanism causing this effect, namely reversible, RXR-mediated, thyroid hormone-independent suppression of TSH gene expression. Treatment of patients with bexarotene-induced hypothyroidism commonly requires high doses of thyroid hormone for replacement therapy, often twice the typical doses used to treat more common etiologies of hypothyroidism.

Invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the breast metastatic to the urinary bladder and endometrium: diagnostic pitfalls and review of the literature of tumors with micropapillary features.,Annals of diagnostic pathology,Ann Diagn Pathol,2003-04-01,"Carcinomas with micropapillary features have been described in the breast, urinary bladder, lung, and ovary. They are characterized by the presence of micropapillary tufts in clear spaces. Unequivocal vascular invasion is usually present at the periphery of the tumor. Consequently, these tumors have a high propensity for lymph node metastases and high-stage disease. The metastatic carcinoma can consist exclusively of the micropapillary component, which may elicit an erroneous diagnosis if located in the bladder or lung, as in the patient presented herein. We present a case of a 59-year-old woman with a history of bilateral breast carcinoma status post-bilateral mastectomy, chemotherapy, and tamoxifen therapy. She presented with urinary frequency, and a pelvic mass was noted. A biopsy of the endometrium revealed a poorly differentiated carcinoma. Urinary bladder biopsies showed a carcinoma with micropapillary features diagnosed as micropapillary transitional cell carcinoma. She presented to M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX) for further treatment recommendations. The urinary bladder and endometrial biopsies both contained carcinomas with micropapillary features. The mastectomy specimen showed an invasive ductal carcinoma with a significant micropapillary component. The tumor cells from the breast, endometrium, and urinary bladder were positive for cytokeratin (CK) 7 and estrogen receptor and negative for CK20. In view of the morphologic and immunohistochemical profile, the carcinoma in the endometrium and urinary bladder were interpreted as metastatic lesions from the breast primary. Carcinomas with a micropapillary component are morphologically identical in the breast, urinary bladder, and lung. However, micropapillary serous carcinoma has a different appearance more akin to borderline tumors of the ovary. Immunohistochemical stains are useful in distinguishing these lesions in that thyroid transcription factor-1 positivity suggests a lung primary, CK7 and estrogen receptor suggest a breast primary, and both CK7 and CK20 positivity suggest a urinary bladder primary. It is important to exclude metastatic carcinomas with micropapillary features before making a definite diagnosis of a primary tumor.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma is frequently downregulated in a diversity of sporadic nonmedullary thyroid carcinomas.,Oncogene,Oncogene,2003-05-01,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) has previously been implicated in the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), where a translocation with PAX8 has been reported in some 50% of tumors in three small series. The resultant fusion protein inhibits normal PPARgamma function by a dominant-negative mechanism. In a series of 19 FTCs, we identified this translocation in only two tumors (10.5%). However, microarray analysis and semiquantitative RT-PCR demonstrated greatly reduced PPARgamma expression in 13 of 17 (76%) nontranslocation tumors. Immunohistochemical analysis of 142 thyroid tumors showed a statistically significant reduction in PPARgamma immunoreactive protein, not only in FTCs but also in papillary thyroid carcinomas and Hurthle cell carcinomas. This suggests that while the overall frequency of the PAX8-PPARgamma translocation in FTCs may be lower than previously thought, functional downregulation of PPARgamma is a key event in multiple types of thyroid neoplasia and is a possible target for therapeutic intervention.",Journal Article,6109.0,50.0,Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma PPARgamma has previously been implicated in the pathogenesis of follicular carcinoma FTC where a translocation with PAX8 has been reported in some 50 of tumors in three small series The resultant fusion protein inhibits normal PPARgamma function by a dominant-negative mechanism In a series of 19 FTCs we identified this translocation in only two tumors 10.5 However microarray analysis and semiquantitative RT-PCR demonstrated greatly reduced PPARgamma expression in 13 of 17 76 nontranslocation tumors Immunohistochemical analysis of 142 tumors showed a statistically significant reduction in PPARgamma immunoreactive protein not only in FTCs but also in papillary carcinomas and Hurthle cell carcinomas This suggests that while the overall frequency of the PAX8-PPARgamma translocation in FTCs may be lower than previously thought functional downregulation of PPARgamma is a key event in multiple types of neoplasia and is a possible target for therapeutic intervention,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[8659, 8660, 735, 153, 1705, 4799, 71, 373, 85, 1771, 4, 3, 1384, 1, 1974, 134, 8527, 1257, 8, 2006, 5, 8958, 71, 85, 210, 4, 476, 212, 1, 57, 4, 169, 302, 988, 3, 6099, 1212, 178, 1576, 295, 4799, 343, 20, 8, 2156, 199, 670, 4, 8, 988, 1, 326, 19572, 21, 108, 26, 2006, 4, 158, 100, 57, 79, 33, 137, 1727, 65, 2, 8942, 240, 604, 264, 3510, 405, 4799, 55, 4, 233, 1, 269, 846, 53550, 57, 1382, 65, 1, 4785, 57, 224, 8, 712, 93, 628, 4, 4799, 10044, 178, 44, 158, 4, 19572, 84, 120, 4, 1796, 826, 2, 18889, 31, 826, 26, 844, 17, 369, 3, 63, 675, 1, 3, 8958, 4799, 2006, 4, 19572, 68, 40, 280, 76, 373, 2739, 583, 2475, 1, 4799, 16, 8, 825, 774, 4, 232, 630, 1, 2298, 2, 16, 8, 899, 283, 9, 189, 788]",1021.0,12776192,397
"Caveolin-1 and caveolin-2,together with three bone morphogenetic protein-related genes, may encode novel tumor suppressors down-regulated in sporadic follicular thyroid carcinogenesis.",Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2003-06-01,"Thyroid cancer is common, occurring in 1% of the general population. The relative frequencies of two of the most common subtypes of thyroid carcinoma, follicular (FTC) and papillary (PTC), vary depending on the regional prevalence of iodine deficiency. Although PTC has been more extensively studied, the etiology of sporadic FTC is poorly understood. To further elucidate this, we conducted microarray expression comparison of FTC tumors and normal thyroid tissue. Three commonly down-regulated genes, caveolin-1, caveolin-2, and GDF10/BMP3b, were chosen for further study on the basis of their localization to two chromosomal regions, 7q31.1 and 10q11.1, that commonly show loss of heterozygosity in FTC. Two additional genes, glypican-3 and a novel chordin-like gene, were also analyzed in view of their involvement in bone morphogenetic protein signaling and possible interaction with GDF10. Each of these five genes was down-regulated in >or=15 of 19 FTC tumors (79%) by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Caveolin-1 showed preferential down-regulation of its beta-isoform at both the mRNA and protein level, suggesting a distinct function for this isoform. Caveolin-1 is of particular functional interest because it has been shown to interact with PTEN, the tumor suppressor gene mutated in Cowden syndrome, an inherited multiple hamartoma syndrome that includes predisposition to FTC. Immunohistochemical analysis of 141 thyroid tumors of various histological types showed significantly fewer caveolin-1-positive tumors in FTCs, including insular type tumors, and Hurthle cell carcinomas in comparison with normal thyroid. PTC and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas did not show significant down-regulation, and thus, caveolin-1 may become a useful molecular marker to differentiate the various histologies of thyroid malignancies.",Journal Article,6078.0,83.0,cancer is common occurring in 1 of the general population The relative frequencies of two of the most common subtypes of carcinoma follicular FTC and papillary PTC vary depending on the regional prevalence of iodine deficiency Although PTC has been more extensively studied the etiology of sporadic FTC is poorly understood To further elucidate this we conducted microarray expression comparison of FTC tumors and normal tissue Three commonly down-regulated genes caveolin-1 caveolin-2 and GDF10/BMP3b were chosen for further study on the basis of their localization to two chromosomal regions 7q31.1 and 10q11.1 that commonly show loss of heterozygosity in FTC Two additional genes glypican-3 and a novel chordin-like gene were also analyzed in view of their involvement in morphogenetic protein signaling and possible interaction with GDF10 Each of these five genes was down-regulated in or=15 of 19 FTC tumors 79 by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR Caveolin-1 showed preferential down-regulation of its beta-isoform at both the mRNA and protein level suggesting a distinct function for this isoform Caveolin-1 is of particular functional interest because it has been shown to interact with PTEN the tumor suppressor gene mutated in Cowden syndrome an inherited multiple hamartoma syndrome that includes predisposition to FTC Immunohistochemical analysis of 141 tumors of various histological types showed significantly fewer caveolin-1-positive tumors in FTCs including insular type tumors and Hurthle cell carcinomas in comparison with normal PTC and anaplastic carcinomas did not show significant down-regulation and thus caveolin-1 may become a useful molecular marker to differentiate the various histologies of malignancies,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[12, 16, 186, 1821, 4, 14, 1, 3, 1083, 266, 3, 580, 2722, 1, 100, 1, 3, 96, 186, 814, 1, 134, 1974, 8527, 2, 1796, 3748, 2825, 3221, 23, 3, 951, 1078, 1, 4287, 2299, 242, 3748, 71, 85, 80, 3576, 656, 3, 2855, 1, 1928, 8527, 16, 1240, 1784, 6, 195, 3061, 26, 21, 426, 1727, 55, 1155, 1, 8527, 57, 2, 295, 246, 169, 841, 1328, 1065, 214, 8528, 14, 8528, 18, 2, 43254, 53552, 11, 4695, 9, 195, 45, 23, 3, 877, 1, 136, 2145, 6, 100, 1860, 1374, 30423, 14, 2, 33445, 14, 17, 841, 514, 407, 1, 3963, 4, 8527, 100, 402, 214, 17206, 27, 2, 8, 229, 53553, 733, 145, 11, 120, 311, 4, 3811, 1, 136, 799, 4, 12316, 178, 314, 2, 899, 915, 5, 43254, 296, 1, 46, 365, 214, 10, 1328, 1065, 4, 15, 167, 1, 326, 8527, 57, 842, 20, 8942, 1772, 866, 604, 8528, 14, 224, 6629, 1328, 863, 1, 211, 1090, 3995, 28, 110, 3, 956, 2, 178, 301, 802, 8, 834, 343, 9, 26, 3995, 8528, 14, 16, 1, 1454, 583, 1333, 408, 192, 71, 85, 443, 6, 4491, 5, 820, 3, 30, 1245, 145, 1185, 4, 5561, 681, 35, 2986, 232, 8025, 681, 17, 1920, 2863, 6, 8527, 1382, 65, 1, 4379, 57, 1, 747, 1831, 630, 224, 97, 1497, 8528, 14, 109, 57, 4, 19572, 141, 12133, 267, 57, 2, 18889, 31, 826, 4, 1155, 5, 295, 3748, 2, 1841, 826, 205, 44, 514, 93, 1328, 863, 2, 631, 8528, 14, 68, 1417, 8, 999, 219, 952, 6, 3723, 3, 747, 3489, 1, 441]",1741.0,12782592,327

Large bowel polyps were initially diagnosed >25 yr ago, and the patient had undergone multiple colonoscopies and polypectomies. Personal and family history were notable for thyroid goiter and hypothyroidism. Physical examination was notable for lingular papillomatosis. No cutaneous lesions were seen. Upper endoscopy revealed esophageal glycogen acanthosis. There were multiple polyps throughout the stomach and the small and large intestines. Histology of these polyps showed multiple cell types including juvenile polyps, inflammatory polyps with fibromuscular proliferation and lamina propria ganglion cells, and focal adenomatous change. A clinical diagnosis of Cowden syndrome was made. Mutation analysis revealed a variant in exon 8 of the PTEN gene. Direct sequencing revealed a germline heterozygous C.892-895InsA, which is predicted to result in a truncated PTEN protein. Cowden syndrome is an underdiagnosed, underrecognized, autosomal dominant, inherited syndrome. For the gastroenterologist, esophageal acanthosis and multiple hamartomatous polyps should suggest the diagnosis.

Is there a role for radiation therapy in the management of Hürthle cell carcinoma?,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2003-07-01,"To determine the role that radiation therapy may have in the management of resected, unresectable, and metastatic Hürthle cell carcinoma. Retrospective review of 18 patients receiving radiation therapy for Hürthle cell carcinoma of the thyroid gland. The diagnosis was established in 10 men and 8 women between November 1943 and January 1995. Median age was 57.9 years. Initially, 5 patients received adjuvant radiation therapy, 7 received salvage radiation therapy for unresectable recurrent disease, and 6 received palliative radiation therapy for distant metastases. Median follow-up was 107.1 months (range 15.7-351 months). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate and estimate overall survival, cause-specific survival, and locoregional tumor control rate. The 5-year overall and cause-specific survival rates were 66.7% (SE 11.1%) and 71.8% (SE 10.7%), respectively. Adjuvant radiation therapy was successful in preventing recurrence in 4 of 5 patients.

Focal adhesions and associated proteins in medullary thyroid carcinoma cells.,The Journal of surgical research,J. Surg. Res.,2003-05-01,"In medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), mutations in the RET protooncogene lead to oncogenic transformation. RET activation in other cell types has been shown to cause phosphorylation of the focal adhesion-associated proteins focal adhesion kinase (FAK), paxillin, and p130(CAS). We hypothesized that adhesion-dependent signaling might be deranged in MTC cells. Indirect immunofluorescence was used to label beta(1) integrin, FAK, paxillin, and p130CAS. Rhodamine-labeled phalloidin was used to visualize actin microfilaments. Phosphorylated protein was detected by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting for phosphotyrosine. MTC cell invasiveness was quantified using a modified Boyden chamber assay. Clustering of beta(1) integrin, FAK, paxillin, and p130(CAS) into focal adhesions were not detected in MTC cells under any conditions, although clustering was seen as expected in control HeLa cells. Despite this failure, FAK, paxillin and p130(CAS) were all found to be phosphorylated. Actin microfilaments were generally not seen although in a few cells, small, poorly formed microfilaments could be detected. MTC cells invaded poorly as compared with highly invasive cell lines. However a clear difference was noted between invasiveness on growth factor depleted Matrigel and regular Matrigel. In MTC cells, focal adhesions are not seen in response to interaction with extracellular matrix. Consistent with this failure, actin microfilaments are absent or poorly formed and invasion is weak. Despite the absence of focal adhesions, focal adhesion proteins remain phosphorylated, even though in normal cells their signaling activity is dependent on focal adhesion formation.

Comparison of radioiodine biokinetics following the administration of recombinant human thyroid stimulating hormone and after thyroid hormone withdrawal in thyroid carcinoma.,European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,Eur. J. Nucl. Med. Mol. Imaging,2003-07-15,"Iodine kinetics were studied in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer while euthyroid under exogenous thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and while hypothyroid to detect differences in radioiodine uptake, distribution and elimination. Nine patients with total or near-total thyroidectomy on thyroid hormone suppressive therapy received two or three daily doses of 0.9 mg recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) followed by administration of a diagnostic activity of 2 mCi (74 MBq) iodine-131. After the biokinetics assessments had been performed, patients stopped taking thyroid hormones to become hypothyroid. A second 2 mCi (74 MBq) diagnostic activity of 131I was administered, followed by a second set of biokinetics assessments. One week later the patients underwent remnant ablation with a therapeutic activity of 131I. A comparison of the 131I kinetics in the patients while euthyroid and while hypothyroid showed major differences in the doses to the remnant as well as in residence times and radiation exposure to the blood. In the first diagnostic assessment the remnant dose was higher in eight of the nine patients and clearance of the activity from the blood was faster in all of them. The data from this study suggest that radioiodine administration is potent and safe when administered to euthyroid patients following rhTSH administration. Enhanced residence time in the remnant and decreased radiation exposure to the blood were noted when patients were euthyroid compared to when they were rendered hypothyroid. However, all patients received diagnostic activities in the same order: first while euthyroid, followed by hypothyroidism.

"PTEN: one gene, many syndromes.",Human mutation,Hum. Mutat.,2003-09-01,"PTEN, on 10q23.3, encodes a major lipid phosphatase which signals down the phosphoinositol-3-kinase/Akt pathway and effects G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Germline PTEN mutations have been found to occur in 80% of classic Cowden syndrome (CS), 60% of Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), up to 20% of Proteus syndrome (PS), and approximately 50% of a Proteus-like syndrome (PSL). CS is a heritable multiple hamartoma syndrome with a high risk of breast, thyroid, and endometrial carcinomas. BRRS is a congenital autosomal dominant disorder characterized by megencephaly, developmental delay, lipomatosis, and speckled penis. PS and PSL had never been associated with risk of malignancy. Finding germline PTEN mutations in patients with BRRS, PS, and PSL suggests equivalent risks of developing malignancy as in CS with implications for medical management. The mutational spectra of CS and BRRS overlap, with many of the mutations occurring in exons 5, 7, and 8. Genotype-phenotype association analyses have revealed that the presence of germline PTEN mutations is associated with breast tumor development, and that mutations occurring within and 5' of the phosphatase motif were associated with multi-organ involvement. Pooled analysis of PTEN mutation series of CS and BRRS occurring in the last five years reveals that 65% of CS-associated mutations occur in the first five exons encoding the phosphatase domain and the promoter region, while 60% of BRRS-associated mutations occur in the 3' four exons encoding mainly the C2 domain. Somatic PTEN mutations occur with a wide distribution of frequencies in sporadic primary tumors, with the highest frequencies in endometrial carcinomas and glioblastoma multiform.

In essentially all of the hereditary cases and approximately 40% of the sporadic cases of MTC, the RET kinase is constitutively activated by mutation. This suggests that RET may be an effective therapeutic target for treatment of MTC. We show that the indolocarbazole derivatives, CEP-701 and CEP-751, inhibit RET in MTC cells. These compounds effectively inhibit RET phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations <100 nM in 0.5% serum and at somewhat higher concentrations in the presence of 16% serum. They also blocked the growth of these MTC cells in culture. CEP-751 and its prodrug, CEP-2563, also inhibited tumor growth in MTC cell xenografts.

"Constipation, polyps, or cancer? Let PTEN predict your future.",American journal of medical genetics. Part A,Am. J. Med. Genet. A,2003-11-01,"The inherited hamartoma polyposis syndromes encompass several distinct clinical syndromes with different genetic bases, Cowden syndrome (CS), Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS), and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS). Germline mutations in PTEN, encoding a tumor suppressor phosphatase on 10q23.3, is associated with 80% of CS and 60% of BRRS. JPS is caused by mutations in MADH4 and BMPR1A, encoding two members of the TGFB superfamily. Germline mutations in LKB1 (STK11) are associated with a subset of PJS. The number, distribution, and histologic type of polyps differ amongst these syndromes as do component cancer risks. While rare, usually asymptomatic, hamartomatous polyps are felt to be component to CS. Hamartomatous polyposis is usually prominent and symptomatic in BRRS. Polyposis, which can be quite symptomatic, is a cardinal component feature of PJS and JPS. Interestingly, glycogenic acanthosis of the esophagus is highly predictive of CS and the presence of PTEN mutation. PTEN mutation positive CS have been shown to be at increased risk of breast, thyroid, and endometrial cancer. PTEN mutation positive BRRS are at increased risk of at least breast cancer, possibly that of the thyroid as well.

Intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms in the RET protooncogene are associated with a subset of apparently sporadic pheochromocytoma and may modulate age of onset.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2003-10-01,"Approximately 75% of pheochromocytomas are sporadic. Germline mutations in RET, VHL, SDHB, and SDHD have been shown to cause the 25% that are hereditary. Germline high penetrance gain-of-function RET mutations cause multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, of which medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and pheochromocytoma are components, whereas loss-of-function mutations cause Hirschprung disease (HSCR). A low-penetrance founder locus, in linkage disequilibrium with a RET ancestral haplotype comprising specific alleles at three intron (IVS) 1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (haplotype 0) and SNP A45A, predisposes to the majority of isolated HSCR. A different low-penetrance locus, in linkage disequilibrium with IVS 1 haplotype 2 and SNP S836S, was associated with a subset of sporadic MTC. We, therefore, sought to determine whether RET might also be a low-penetrance gene for apparently sporadic pheochromocytoma. We analyzed 104 pheochromocytoma cases without germline mutations in RET, VHL, SDHD, and SDHB for their status at A45, S836, three IVS 1 SNPs, and a novel upstream insertion/deletion variant. Pheochromocytoma cases were not associated with either A45A or S836S, but we found that cases were associated with haplotype 0 (P = 0.032). However, unlike HSCR, this pheochromocytoma-associated haplotype 0 was not associated with A45A. Taken together with the strengthening of association with the addition of the 5' insertion/deletion variant data (P = 0.016), our observations suggest the presence of a low-penetrance pheochromocytoma susceptibility locus in a region upstream of the putative loci for HSCR and apparently sporadic MTC.",Journal Article,5956.0,23.0,Approximately 75 of pheochromocytomas are sporadic Germline mutations in RET VHL SDHB and SDHD have been shown to cause the 25 that are hereditary Germline high penetrance gain-of-function RET mutations cause multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 of which medullary carcinoma MTC and are components whereas loss-of-function mutations cause Hirschprung disease HSCR A low-penetrance founder locus in linkage disequilibrium with a RET ancestral haplotype comprising specific alleles at three intron IVS 1 single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs haplotype 0 and SNP A45A predisposes to the majority of isolated HSCR A different low-penetrance locus in linkage disequilibrium with IVS 1 haplotype 2 and SNP S836S was associated with a subset of sporadic MTC We therefore sought to determine whether RET might also be a low-penetrance gene for apparently sporadic We analyzed 104 cases without germline mutations in RET VHL SDHD and SDHB for their status at A45 S836 three IVS 1 SNPs and a novel upstream insertion/deletion variant cases were not associated with either A45A or S836S but we found that cases were associated with haplotype 0 P 0.032 However unlike HSCR this pheochromocytoma-associated haplotype 0 was not associated with A45A Taken together with the strengthening of association with the addition of the 5 insertion/deletion variant data P 0.016 our observations suggest the presence of a low-penetrance susceptibility locus in a region upstream of the putative loci for HSCR and apparently sporadic MTC,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[705, 481, 1, 9977, 32, 1928, 1009, 138, 4, 2412, 3808, 5168, 2, 6551, 47, 85, 443, 6, 708, 3, 243, 17, 32, 2305, 1009, 64, 4792, 1803, 1, 343, 2412, 138, 708, 232, 1293, 2298, 267, 18, 1, 92, 4564, 134, 3959, 2, 32, 1628, 547, 407, 1, 343, 138, 708, 53805, 34, 18239, 8, 154, 4792, 7243, 2474, 4, 4820, 8459, 5, 8, 2412, 15165, 4179, 3538, 112, 2558, 28, 169, 6259, 26223, 14, 226, 1579, 1203, 1109, 4179, 13, 2, 1845, 30346, 10563, 6, 3, 686, 1, 1355, 18239, 8, 338, 154, 4792, 2474, 4, 4820, 8459, 5, 26223, 14, 4179, 18, 2, 1845, 33342, 10, 41, 5, 8, 697, 1, 1928, 3959, 21, 673, 990, 6, 223, 317, 2412, 822, 120, 40, 8, 154, 4792, 145, 9, 6343, 1928, 21, 311, 3407, 140, 187, 1009, 138, 4, 2412, 3808, 6551, 2, 5168, 9, 136, 156, 28, 43397, 53806, 169, 26223, 14, 1109, 2, 8, 229, 3988, 5099, 1528, 1142, 140, 11, 44, 41, 5, 361, 30346, 15, 33342, 84, 21, 204, 17, 140, 11, 41, 5, 4179, 13, 19, 13, 4708, 137, 4246, 18239, 26, 12594, 41, 4179, 13, 10, 44, 41, 5, 30346, 1633, 1162, 5, 3, 14200, 1, 248, 5, 3, 352, 1, 3, 33, 5099, 1528, 1142, 74, 19, 13, 3820, 114, 2172, 309, 3, 463, 1, 8, 154, 4792, 1432, 2474, 4, 8, 1053, 3988, 1, 3, 2743, 2012, 9, 18239, 2, 6343, 1928, 3959]",1510.0,14557473,115

Information about the presentations and outcomes of patients with STM are limited. The authors sought to compare the clinical characteristics, course, and outcomes of patients with primary or secondary thyroid malignancies. The authors reviewed the medical records of 8 children with PTM and 17 children with STM referred to St Jude Children's Research Hospital between February 1962 and February 2002 for evaluation and treatment of malignant thyroid carcinoma. The 8 children who had primary thyroid carcinoma had it diagnosed at a median age of 12.5 years (range, 7.3 to 16.3 years). Seven patients had papillary carcinoma, and 1 patient had follicular carcinoma. Three of the 8 (37.5%) had metastatic disease involving regional lymph nodes; 2 patients (25.0%) had lung metastases. Six patients required radioactive iodine (I 131) ablation for residual or metastatic disease after surgical resection. All 8 patients remain alive a median of 22.6 years after diagnosis (range, 0.7 to 30.5 years); 1 continues to receive radioactive iodine (I 131) ablation for persistent disease. Seventeen patients had thyroid carcinoma as a second malignant neoplasm after treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 6), Hodgkin's disease (n = 5), central nervous system tumor (n = 2), Wilms' tumor (n = 1), retinoblastoma (n = 1), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 1), or neuroblastoma (n = 1). Patients with secondary thyroid carcinoma presented at a median age of 21.5 years (range, 15.3 to 42.6 years), a median of 16.2 years (range, 0.9 to 29.2 years) after diagnosis of the primary cancer. Twelve of the 17 patients (70.6%) had received radiation to the thyroid gland during therapy for the primary cancer. Four patients (23.5%) had metastatic disease involving regional lymph nodes.

High risk of subsequent neoplasms continues with extended follow-up of childhood Hodgkin's disease: report from the Late Effects Study Group.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2003-12-01,"We present an update of a previously reported Late Effects Study Group cohort of 1,380 children with Hodgkin's disease (HD) diagnosed between 1955 and 1986 in patients aged 16 years or younger. We describe the pattern and incidence of subsequent neoplasms (SNs) occurring with extended follow-up. Median age at diagnosis of HD was 11.7 years (range, 0.3 to 16.9 years) and at last follow-up was 27.8 years. Median length of follow-up was 17.0 years. An additional 103 SNs were ascertained (total SNs = 212). The cohort was at an 18.5-fold increased risk of developing SNs compared with the general population (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 18.5, 95% CI, 15.6 to 21.7). The cumulative incidence of any second malignancy was 10.6% at 20 years, increasing to 26.3% at 30 years; and of solid malignancies was 7.3% at 20 years, increasing to 23.5% at 30 years. Breast cancer was the most common solid malignancy (SIR, 56.7). Other commonly occurring solid malignancies included thyroid cancer (SIR, 36.4), bone tumors (SIR, 37.1), and colorectal (SIR, 36.4), lung (SIR, 27.3), and gastric cancers (SIR, 63.9). Risk factors for solid tumors included young age at HD and radiation-based therapy. Thirty-two patients developed third neoplasms, with the cumulative incidence approaching 21% at 10 years from diagnosis of second malignancy. Additional follow-up of this large cohort of HD survivors documents an increasing occurrence of known radiation-associated solid tumors, (breast and thyroid cancers), as well as emergence of epithelial neoplasms common in adults, (colon and lung cancers) at a younger age than expected in the general population, necessitating ongoing surveillance of this high risk population.",Journal Article,5895.0,449.0,"We present an update of a previously reported Late Effects Study Group cohort of 1,380 children with 's disease HD diagnosed between 1955 and 1986 in patients aged 16 years or younger We describe the pattern and incidence of subsequent neoplasms SNs occurring with extended follow-up Median age at diagnosis of HD was 11.7 years range 0.3 to 16.9 years and at last follow-up was 27.8 years Median length of follow-up was 17.0 years An additional 103 SNs were ascertained total SNs 212 The cohort was at an 18.5-fold increased risk of developing SNs compared with the general population standardized incidence ratio SIR 18.5 95 CI 15.6 to 21.7 The cumulative incidence of any second malignancy was 10.6 at 20 years increasing to 26.3 at 30 years and of solid malignancies was 7.3 at 20 years increasing to 23.5 at 30 years cancer was the most common solid malignancy SIR 56.7 Other commonly occurring solid malignancies included cancer SIR 36.4 tumors SIR 37.1 and SIR 36.4 SIR 27.3 and cancers SIR 63.9 Risk factors for solid tumors included young age at HD and radiation-based therapy Thirty-two patients developed third neoplasms with the cumulative incidence approaching 21 at 10 years from diagnosis of second malignancy Additional follow-up of this large cohort of HD survivors documents an increasing occurrence of known radiation-associated solid tumors and cancers as well as emergence of epithelial neoplasms common in adults and cancers at a younger age than expected in the general population necessitating ongoing surveillance of this high risk population",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[21, 364, 35, 2991, 1, 8, 373, 210, 807, 176, 45, 87, 180, 1, 14, 8389, 541, 5, 292, 34, 2701, 265, 59, 24655, 2, 3751, 4, 7, 1032, 245, 60, 15, 773, 21, 897, 3, 1177, 2, 287, 1, 706, 1179, 7323, 1821, 5, 1747, 166, 126, 52, 89, 28, 147, 1, 2701, 10, 175, 67, 60, 184, 13, 27, 6, 245, 83, 60, 2, 28, 1060, 166, 126, 10, 428, 66, 60, 52, 1318, 1, 166, 126, 10, 269, 13, 60, 35, 402, 3283, 7323, 11, 5240, 181, 7323, 6586, 3, 180, 10, 28, 35, 203, 33, 1116, 101, 43, 1, 931, 7323, 72, 5, 3, 1083, 266, 1670, 287, 197, 3636, 203, 33, 48, 58, 167, 49, 6, 239, 67, 3, 967, 287, 1, 500, 419, 710, 10, 79, 49, 28, 179, 60, 602, 6, 432, 27, 28, 201, 60, 2, 1, 537, 441, 10, 67, 27, 28, 179, 60, 602, 6, 382, 33, 28, 201, 60, 12, 10, 3, 96, 186, 537, 710, 3636, 664, 67, 127, 841, 1821, 537, 441, 159, 12, 3636, 511, 39, 57, 3636, 567, 14, 2, 3636, 511, 39, 3636, 428, 27, 2, 163, 3636, 676, 83, 43, 130, 9, 537, 57, 159, 1169, 89, 28, 2701, 2, 121, 90, 36, 977, 100, 7, 276, 1282, 1179, 5, 3, 967, 287, 7773, 239, 28, 79, 60, 29, 147, 1, 419, 710, 402, 166, 126, 1, 26, 375, 180, 1, 2701, 332, 9337, 35, 602, 2291, 1, 440, 121, 41, 537, 57, 2, 163, 22, 149, 22, 3397, 1, 701, 1179, 186, 4, 857, 2, 163, 28, 8, 773, 89, 76, 1336, 4, 3, 1083, 266, 8365, 942, 617, 1, 26, 64, 43, 266]",1567.0,14645429,35
IFNgamma sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human thyroid carcinoma cells by upregulating Bak expression.,Oncogene,Oncogene,2004-01-01,"TRAIL preferentially induces apoptosis in tumor cells and virus-infected cells. Unlike other tumor necrosis factor family members, TRAIL does not kill cells from most normal tissues and has thus been proposed as a promising new cancer treatment. Our study demonstrated that IFNgamma combined with TRAIL can trigger apoptosis in vitro in several resistant thyroid tumor cell lines, such as thyroid anaplastic carcinoma cells (ARO cells), while either agent alone exerts only a minimal effect. We further tested this effect on a mouse thyroid tumor model, when in vivo tumor growth was also significantly inhibited by this combination. The mechanism of how IFNgamma sensitized thyroid carcinoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis was investigated by screening global gene alterations in ARO cells treated with IFNgamma. Microarray data revealed that a proapoptotic gene, Bak, is markedly upregulated by IFNgamma, and this was confirmed by RNase protection assay. Western blot analysis also showed a significant increase in Bak at the protein level. Upregulation of Bak and sensitization for apoptosis by IFNgamma was blocked by overexpression of antisense Bak in ARO cells. Furthermore, overexpression of Bak sensitized ARO cell to TRAIL-induced apoptosis without the need for IFNgamma pretreatment. This suggests that Bak is a regulatory molecule involved in IFNgamma-facilitated TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in thyroid cancer cells.",Journal Article,5864.0,36.0,TRAIL preferentially induces apoptosis in tumor cells and virus-infected cells Unlike other tumor necrosis factor family members TRAIL does not kill cells from most normal tissues and has thus been proposed as a promising new cancer treatment Our study demonstrated that IFNgamma combined with TRAIL can trigger apoptosis in vitro in several resistant tumor cell lines such as anaplastic carcinoma cells ARO cells while either agent alone exerts only a minimal effect We further tested this effect on a mouse tumor model when in vivo tumor growth was also significantly inhibited by this combination The mechanism of how IFNgamma sensitized carcinoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis was investigated by screening global gene alterations in ARO cells treated with IFNgamma Microarray data revealed that a proapoptotic gene Bak is markedly upregulated by IFNgamma and this was confirmed by RNase protection assay Western blot analysis also showed a significant increase in Bak at the protein level Upregulation of Bak and sensitization for apoptosis by IFNgamma was blocked by overexpression of antisense Bak in ARO cells Furthermore overexpression of Bak sensitized ARO cell to TRAIL-induced apoptosis without the need for IFNgamma pretreatment This suggests that Bak is a regulatory molecule involved in IFNgamma-facilitated TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[2585, 3509, 1516, 351, 4, 30, 37, 2, 1450, 3369, 37, 4246, 127, 30, 1523, 161, 607, 1684, 2585, 1097, 44, 5097, 37, 29, 96, 295, 742, 2, 71, 631, 85, 1587, 22, 8, 721, 217, 12, 24, 114, 45, 264, 17, 12490, 397, 5, 2585, 122, 5781, 351, 4, 439, 4, 392, 436, 30, 31, 285, 225, 22, 1841, 134, 37, 19613, 37, 369, 361, 420, 279, 5685, 158, 8, 1048, 254, 21, 195, 650, 26, 254, 23, 8, 830, 30, 202, 198, 4, 386, 30, 129, 10, 120, 97, 879, 20, 26, 150, 3, 670, 1, 832, 12490, 4242, 134, 37, 6, 2585, 277, 351, 10, 565, 20, 453, 1648, 145, 593, 4, 19613, 37, 73, 5, 12490, 1727, 74, 553, 17, 8, 4118, 145, 5599, 16, 2195, 2684, 20, 12490, 2, 26, 10, 557, 20, 18143, 3525, 719, 1521, 2639, 65, 120, 224, 8, 93, 344, 4, 5599, 28, 3, 178, 301, 2218, 1, 5599, 2, 6272, 9, 351, 20, 12490, 10, 2582, 20, 851, 1, 4645, 5599, 4, 19613, 37, 798, 851, 1, 5599, 4242, 19613, 31, 6, 2585, 277, 351, 187, 3, 594, 9, 12490, 1194, 26, 844, 17, 5599, 16, 8, 1253, 1354, 646, 4, 12490, 4667, 2585, 517, 351, 4, 12, 37]",1366.0,14647456,173

Medullary thyroid carcinoma: results of a standardized surgical approach in a contemporary series of 80 consecutive patients.,Surgery,Surgery,2003-12-01,"The surgical management and follow-up strategy in patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) remain controversial because of the lack of data on the natural history of these tumors and their patterns of progression. We reviewed the records of all patients who underwent a cervical operation for MTC between 1991 and 2002. Compartment-oriented surgery (COS) was performed to minimize the risk of cervical recurrence. We identified 92 consecutive patients who underwent a cervical operation for MTC: 80 had invasive MTC, and 12 had C-cell hyperplasia after prophylactic thyroidectomy for familial MTC. Ten (13%) of the 80 patients with invasive MTC presented with distant metastases and underwent COS to achieve local-regional control; cervical recurrence developed in none, but three have died of MTC. The remaining 70 patients underwent COS for primary (n=23) or recurrent (n=47) MTC. Disease recurred in 18 (26%) of these 70 patients at a median follow-up of 35 months, with 10 (14%) of the recurrences being cervical. Recurrent disease was associated with a basal calcitonin level of >250 pg/mL in all but four patients, two of whom showed tumor dedifferentiation.

Role of preoperative ultrasonography in the surgical management of patients with thyroid cancer.,Surgery,Surgery,2003-12-01,"Cervical recurrence occurs in up to 30% of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma. We retrospectively compared preoperative transcutaneous ultrasonography and physical examination (PE) results in the detection of local-regional metastases (lymph node and soft tissue) in patients with thyroid cancer. Data were collected retrospectively from the medical records of patients with thyroid carcinoma who underwent preoperative ultrasonography. Patients were divided into 3 groups: group 1, those undergoing primary thyroid/neck surgery; group 2, those undergoing reoperation for persistent disease; and group 3, those undergoing reoperation for recurrent thyroid carcinoma. For each group, we recorded the frequencies with which ultrasonography detected disease in a neck compartment (central or lateral) that was normal on PE. Two hundred twelve patients underwent operation for primary, persistent, or recurrent papillary (n=130), medullary (n=61), or follicular/Hürthle cell (n=21) carcinoma. Ultrasonography detected additional sites of metastatic disease not appreciated on PE in 21 (20%) of 107 group 1 patients, 9 (32%) of 28 group 2 patients, and 52 (68%) of 77 group 3 patients. The surgical procedure performed was altered by the information obtained from preoperative ultrasonography in 82 (39%) of the 212 patients. Of the 107 group 1 patients, cervical recurrence has been detected in only 6 (6%) at a median follow-up of 36 months, in spite of 67 (63%) having tumors larger than 2 cm or lymph node metastases. Preoperative high-quality ultrasonography detected lymph node or soft-tissue metastases in neck compartments believed to be uninvolved by PE in 39% of patients.

A retrospective chart review was performed of patients who underwent thyroidectomy for nodular disease between June 1997 and June 2002 identifying patients with a final diagnosis of FVPTC. FNA and IP results were reviewed in this group of patients and correlated with those of final histopathologic study. The sensitivity of FNA and IP was calculated. Eighty-two patients had a final diagnosis of FVPTC. Eighty-six preoperative FNAs were obtained in 80 patients, leading to a diagnosis of PTC in 7 (sensitivity 9%). Intraoperative pathologic study was performed in 31 patients with suspicious FNA results, of which 13 were definitive for PTC (sensitivity 42%).

Diagnostic strategies for unknown primary cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2004-05-01,"Unknown primary cancer (UPC) is defined by the presence of metastatic disease for which a primary site is undetectable on presentation. Computed tomography scan of the body was performed routinely in search of the primary cancer and invasive procedures were pursued in selective cases. Magnetic resonance imaging of the breast enables identification of an occult breast primary tumor in < or = 75% of women who present with adenocarcinoma in the axillary lymph nodes and can influence surgical management. Positron emission tomography scan also can be used in the diagnosis of UPCs, but its value is controversial. Cytokeratins 7 and 20 and thyroid transcription factor are some of the histochemical markers used in most patients who present with metastatic adenocarcinoma.

Frequent inactivation of PTEN by promoter hypermethylation in microsatellite instability-high sporadic colorectal cancers.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2004-05-01,"Loss of PTEN tumor suppressor function is observed in tumors of breast, prostate, thyroid, and endometrial origin. Allelic losses in the proximity of the PTEN locus (10q23) also occur in sporadic colorectal cancers (CRCs), but biallelic inactivation of this site has not been frequently demonstrated. We hypothesized that alternative mechanisms of PTEN allelic inactivation, such as promoter hypermethylation, might be operative in CRC and that PTEN inactivation may be related to recognized forms of genomic instability. We characterized a cohort of 273 sporadic CRCs by determining their microsatellite instability (MSI) status. Of these, 146 cancers were examined for PTEN promoter methylation by methylation-specific PCR. Mutations at the poly(A)6 repeat sequences in PTEN exons 7 and 8 and deletions at the 10q23 locus were also identified using microsatellite analysis. The presence of PTEN protein was determined by immunostaining, and the results were correlated with the promoter methylation status. We observed that PTEN promoter hypermethylation was a frequent occurrence in MSI-high (MSI-H) tumors (19.1% of MSI-H versus 2.2% of MSI-low/microsatellite stable tumors; P = 0.002). A PTEN mutation or a deletion event was present in 60% of the tumors with promoter region hypermethylation. Hypermethylation of the PTEN promoter correlated significantly with either decreased or complete loss of PTEN protein expression (P = 0.004). This is the first demonstration of PTEN inactivation as a result of promoter hypermethylation in MSI-H sporadic CRCs. These data suggest that this silencing mechanism plays a major role in PTEN inactivation and, in colon cancer, may be more important than either allelic losses or inactivating mutations. The significant correlation of PTEN hypermethylation with MSI-H tumors further suggests that PTEN is an additional important ""target"" of methylation along with the hMLH1 gene in the evolution of MSI-H CRCs and also confers the ""second hit"" in the biallelic inactivation mechanism for some proportion of tumors.",Journal Article,5743.0,234.0,Loss of PTEN tumor suppressor function is observed in tumors of and origin Allelic losses in the proximity of the PTEN locus 10q23 also occur in sporadic cancers CRCs but biallelic inactivation of this site has not been frequently demonstrated We hypothesized that alternative mechanisms of PTEN allelic inactivation such as promoter hypermethylation might be operative in CRC and that PTEN inactivation may be related to recognized forms of genomic instability We characterized a cohort of 273 sporadic CRCs by determining their microsatellite instability MSI status Of these 146 cancers were examined for PTEN promoter methylation by methylation-specific PCR Mutations at the poly A 6 repeat sequences in PTEN exons 7 and 8 and deletions at the 10q23 locus were also identified using microsatellite analysis The presence of PTEN protein was determined by immunostaining and the results were correlated with the promoter methylation status We observed that PTEN promoter hypermethylation was a frequent occurrence in MSI-high MSI-H tumors 19.1 of MSI-H versus 2.2 of MSI-low/microsatellite stable tumors P 0.002 A PTEN mutation or a deletion event was present in 60 of the tumors with promoter region hypermethylation Hypermethylation of the PTEN promoter correlated significantly with either decreased or complete loss of PTEN protein expression P 0.004 This is the first demonstration of PTEN inactivation as a result of promoter hypermethylation in MSI-H sporadic CRCs These data suggest that this silencing mechanism plays a major role in PTEN inactivation and in cancer may be more important than either allelic losses or inactivating mutations The significant correlation of PTEN hypermethylation with MSI-H tumors further suggests that PTEN is an additional important `` target '' of methylation along with the hMLH1 gene in the evolution of MSI-H CRCs and also confers the `` second hit '' in the biallelic inactivation mechanism for some proportion of tumors,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[407, 1, 820, 30, 1245, 343, 16, 164, 4, 57, 1, 2, 1938, 3861, 5324, 4, 3, 6167, 1, 3, 820, 2474, 13783, 120, 1271, 4, 1928, 163, 4184, 84, 6435, 2297, 1, 26, 606, 71, 44, 85, 746, 264, 21, 1237, 17, 1091, 483, 1, 820, 3861, 2297, 225, 22, 973, 2575, 822, 40, 1208, 4, 590, 2, 17, 820, 2297, 68, 40, 139, 6, 1904, 2377, 1, 572, 1753, 21, 765, 8, 180, 1, 9385, 1928, 4184, 20, 2196, 136, 2226, 1753, 1494, 156, 1, 46, 4909, 163, 11, 409, 9, 820, 973, 569, 20, 569, 112, 604, 138, 28, 3, 2699, 8, 49, 2334, 2866, 4, 820, 3885, 67, 2, 66, 2, 2439, 28, 3, 13783, 2474, 11, 120, 108, 75, 2226, 65, 3, 463, 1, 820, 178, 10, 509, 20, 5027, 2, 3, 99, 11, 438, 5, 3, 973, 569, 156, 21, 164, 17, 820, 973, 2575, 10, 8, 908, 2291, 4, 1494, 64, 1494, 555, 57, 326, 14, 1, 1494, 555, 185, 18, 18, 1, 1494, 154, 2226, 585, 57, 19, 13, 1111, 8, 820, 258, 15, 8, 1528, 774, 10, 364, 4, 335, 1, 3, 57, 5, 973, 1053, 2575, 2575, 1, 3, 820, 973, 438, 97, 5, 361, 340, 15, 236, 407, 1, 820, 178, 55, 19, 13, 1520, 26, 16, 3, 157, 6533, 1, 820, 2297, 22, 8, 757, 1, 973, 2575, 4, 1494, 555, 1928, 4184, 46, 74, 309, 17, 26, 2077, 670, 1698, 8, 458, 200, 4, 820, 2297, 2, 4, 12, 68, 40, 80, 305, 76, 361, 3861, 5324, 15, 6096, 138, 3, 93, 816, 1, 820, 2575, 5, 1494, 555, 57, 195, 844, 17, 820, 16, 35, 402, 305, 283, 522, 1, 569, 1510, 5, 3, 7098, 145, 4, 3, 2554, 1, 1494, 555, 4184, 2, 120, 4020, 3, 419, 6519, 522, 4, 3, 6435, 2297, 670, 9, 476, 920, 1, 57]",1968.0,15126336,264
Thyroid cancer incidence trends in Belarus: examining the impact of Chernobyl.,International journal of epidemiology,Int J Epidemiol,2004-05-27,"While prior studies of thyroid cancer incidence within Belarus have increased since the 1986 Chernobyl reactor accident, the magnitude of increase is not well quantified. Using Belarussian national cancer registry data, trends in average annual age-adjusted thyroid cancer incidence rates were examined by calendar year and gender. Incidence rates were also examined across specified time intervals, for specific age groups at diagnosis, and in 'higher exposure' regions compared with 'lower exposure' areas. Age-adjusted thyroid cancer incidence rates (adjusted to the WHO 2000 world population) have increased between 1970 and 2001 from 0.4 per 100 000 to 3.5 per 100 000 among males (+775%) and from 0.8 per 100 000 to 16.2 per 100 000 among females (+1925%). The relative increase among males (+1020%) and females (+3286%) in 'high exposure' areas exceeded increases among males (+571%) and females (+250%) in 'lower exposure' areas of Belarus. Dramatic increases in thyroid cancer incidence rate ratios were noted among both males and females and in all age groups. The highest incidence rate ratios were observed among people from 'higher exposure' areas ages 0-14 yr at time of diagnosis. Marked increases in the incidence of thyroid cancer have occurred over a relatively limited period of observation in all areas of the Republic of Belarus and among all age categories.

Patient-specific dosimetry for 131I thyroid cancer therapy using 124I PET and 3-dimensional-internal dosimetry (3D-ID) software.,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",J. Nucl. Med.,2004-08-01,"Compared with conventional, whole-organ, S-factor-based dosimetry, 3-dimensional (3D), patient-specific dosimetry better accounts for radionuclide distribution and anatomic patient variability. Its accuracy, however, is limited by the quality of the cumulated activity information that is provided as input. This input has typically been obtained from SPECT and planar imaging studies. The objective was to implement and evaluate PET-based, patient-specific, 3D dosimetry for thyroid cancer patients. Three to 4 PET imaging studies were obtained over a 7-d period in 15 patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma after administration of (124)I-NaI. Subsequently, patients were treated with (131)I on the basis of established clinical parameters. Retrospective dosimetry was performed using registered (124)I PET images that were corrected for the half-life difference between (124)I and (131)I. A voxel-by-voxel integration, over time, of the resulting (131)I-equivalent PET-derived images was performed to provide a single 3D dataset representing the spatial distribution of cumulated activity values for each patient. Image manipulation and registration were performed using Multiple Image Analysis Utility (MIAU), a software package developed previously. The software package, 3D-Internal Dosimetry (3D-ID), was used to obtain absorbed dose maps from the cumulated activity image sets. Spatial distributions of absorbed dose, isodose contours, dose-volume histograms (DVHs), and mean absorbed dose estimates were obtained for a total of 56 tumors.

In both syndromes, pheochromocytomas as well as head and neck paragangliomas occur; however, details for individual risks and other clinical characteristics are unknown. To determine the differences in clinical features in carriers of SDHB mutations and SDHD mutations. Population-based genetic screening for SDHB and SDHD germline mutations in 417 unrelated patients with adrenal or extra-adrenal abdominal or thoracic pheochromocytomas (n = 334) or head and neck paragangliomas (n = 83), but without syndromic features, from 2 registries based in Germany and central Poland, conducted from April 1, 2000, until May 15, 2004. Demographic and clinical findings with respect to gene mutation in SDHB vs SDHD compared with nonmutation carriers. A total of 49 (12%) of 417 registrants carried SDHB or SDHD mutations. In addition, 28 SDHB and 23 SDHD mutation carriers were newly detected among relatives of these carriers. Comparison of 53 SDHB and 47 SDHD total mutation carriers showed similar ages at diagnosis but differences in penetrance and of tumor manifestations. Head and neck paragangliomas (10/32 vs 27/34, respectively, P<.001) and multifocal (9/32 vs 25/34, respectively, P<.001) tumors were more frequent in carriers of SDHD mutations. In contrast, SDHB mutation carriers have an increased frequency of malignant disease (11/32 vs 0/34, P<.001). Renal cell cancer was observed in 2 SDHB mutation carriers and papillary thyroid cancer in 1 SDHB mutation carrier and 1 SDHD mutation carrier. In contrast with SDHD mutation carriers (PGL-1) who have more frequent multifocal paragangliomas, SDHB mutation carriers (PGL-4) are more likely to develop malignant disease and possibly extraparaganglial neoplasias, including renal cell and thyroid carcinomas.

Papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas show distinctly different microarray expression profiles and can be distinguished by a minimum of five genes.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2004-09-01,"We have previously conducted independent microarray expression analyses of the two most common types of nonmedullary thyroid carcinoma, namely papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). In this study, we sought to combine our data sets to shed light on the similarities and differences between these tumor types. Microarray data from six PTCs, nine FTCs, and 13 normal thyroid samples were normalized to remove interlaboratory variability and then analyzed by unsupervised clustering, t test, and by comparison of absolute and change calls. Expression changes in four genes not previously implicated in thyroid carcinogenesis were verified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on these same samples, together with eight additional FTC tumors. PTCs showed two distinct groups of genes that were either over- or underexpressed compared with normal thyroid, whereas the predominant changes in FTCs were of decreased expression. Five genes could collectively distinguish the two tumor types. PTCs showed overexpression of CITED1, claudin-10 (CLDN10), and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 (IGFBP6) but showed no change in expression of caveolin-1 (CAV1) or -2 (CAV2); conversely, FTCs did not express CLDN10 and had decreased expression of IGFBP6 and/or CAV1 and CAV2. PTC and FTC show distinctive microarray expression profiles, suggesting that either they have different molecular origins or they diverge distinctly from a common origin.

XRCC1 and glutathione-S-transferase gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to radiotherapy-related malignancies in survivors of Hodgkin disease.,Cancer,Cancer,2004-09-01,"One of the most serious late effects of treatment for childhood cancer is the occurrence of subsequent malignancy. Survivors of Hodgkin disease (HD), in particular, have been shown to be at high risk of subsequent malignancy, the occurrence of which has been associated strongly with exposure to radiotherapy. In the current study, the authors investigated the association between polymorphisms in 3 genes--glutathione-S-transferase M1 (GSTM1), glutathione-S-transferase T1 (GSTT1), and XRCC1, with roles in protection from a variety of DNA-damaging agents-and the risk of subsequent malignancy in 650 survivors of HD enrolled in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study who had received radiotherapy. Individuals lacking GSTM1 but not GSTT1 were at increased risk of any subsequent malignancy (odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-2.3), and for subsequent cancer within the radiation field (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.9-2.1). A nonsignificant increased risk of thyroid carcinoma was observed in individuals lacking either GSTM1 (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 0.8-10.9) or GSTT1 (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 0.6-23.5). Individuals having the genotype of the arginine/glutamine polymorphism at codon 399 in the XRCC1 gene (R399) showed a nonsignificant increased risk of breast carcinoma compared with those without (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.7-2.7), and a nonsignificant decreased risk against a subsequent thyroid carcinoma (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.2-1.6).

Treatment of aggressive thyroid cancer with an oncolytic herpes virus.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2004-11-01,"Although many thyroid cancers carry a favorable prognosis, there is a subgroup of patients with more aggressive histologies. Current therapies offer no significant survival benefit to patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinomas, which are considered fatal. Oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) have potent antitumor effects against a variety of human malignancies. We assessed the activity of a replication-competent, attenuated, oncolytic HSV (NV1023) against 7 different thyroid cancers, including one papillary (NPA-187), one follicular (WRO82-1), one medullary (DRO81-1) and 4 anaplastic (DRO90-1, ARO, KAT-4C and KAT-18) cell lines. Only the follicular WRO82-1 line was resistant to NV1023 infection and cell lysis at a concentration of 5 viral pfu per cell (MOI 5). All other cell lines at MOI 5 demonstrated >95% infection in vitro at day 2 by X-gal staining and >88% cell death at day 4 by cytotoxicity assays. Even at MOI 0.1, 4 of these lines displayed complete cell death by day 7. Viral proliferation assays revealed that all of the nonfollicular cell lines supported logarithmic viral replication. Flank tumors of NPA-187, DRO81-1, DRO90-1 and ARO in athymic nude mice were treated with NV1023 (2 x 10(7) pfu). All NPA-187 tumors completely regressed following a single dose. DRO81-1 tumors demonstrated partial response with a single dose and significant improvement with 3 serial doses. ARO and DRO90-1 tumors showed a significant response following either single injection (54 +/- 22 and 292 +/- 138 mm3, respectively) or 3 serial injections (33 +/- 14 and 241 +/- 68 mm3, respectively) compared to saline injections (472 +/- 193 and 1,257 +/- 204 mm3, respectively) at day 20.

Vaccination of patients with small-cell lung cancer with synthetic fucosyl GM-1 conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2004-09-01,"Immunotherapy directed toward cell surface antigens may provide a novel approach to the eradication of chemoresistant micrometastatic disease in patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Studies in SCLC cell lines and human tissues suggest that the ganglioside fucosyl GM1 is an abundant yet specific target. A prior clinical study demonstrated the potent immunogenicity of fucosyl GM-1 derived from bovine thyroid gland, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and administered with QS-21 adjuvant. We tested the immunogenicity of three different doses of a synthetic version of fucosyl-GM1 in patients with SCLC after a major response to initial therapy. The primary end point was to establish the lowest effective dose capable of inducing antibody production. Five of six patients at the 30-microg dose and three of five patients at the 10-microg dose mounted IgM responses of 1:80 or greater. These antibodies were confirmed by flow cytometry in seven of eight cases. None of the patients at the 3-microg dose had titers above 1:80. One patient at the 30-microg dose had an IgG response with a titer of 1:80. The sera from six of the eight responders induced potent complement-mediated cytotoxicity of tumor cells. Vaccination with the synthetic fucosyl GM1-KLH conjugate induces an IgM antibody response against fucosyl GM1 and tumor cells expressing fucosyl GM1, comparable with the response induced by the bovine derivative. We plan to combine synthetic fucosyl GM1 vaccine at a dose of 30 microg with vaccines against three other antigens-GM2, Globo H, and polysialic acid-to test in patients with SCLC after initial chemotherapy.",Clinical Trial,5620.0,98.0,Immunotherapy directed toward cell surface antigens may provide a novel approach to the eradication of chemoresistant micrometastatic disease in patients with small-cell cancer SCLC Studies in SCLC cell lines and human tissues suggest that the ganglioside fucosyl GM1 is an abundant yet specific target A prior clinical study demonstrated the potent immunogenicity of fucosyl GM-1 derived from bovine gland conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin KLH and administered with QS-21 adjuvant We tested the immunogenicity of three different doses of a synthetic version of fucosyl-GM1 in patients with SCLC after a major response to initial therapy The primary end point was to establish the lowest effective dose capable of inducing antibody production Five of six patients at the 30-microg dose and three of five patients at the 10-microg dose mounted IgM responses of 1:80 or greater These antibodies were confirmed by flow cytometry in seven of eight cases None of the patients at the 3-microg dose had titers above 1:80 One patient at the 30-microg dose had an IgG response with a titer of 1:80 The sera from six of the eight responders induced potent complement-mediated cytotoxicity of tumor cells Vaccination with the synthetic fucosyl GM1-KLH conjugate induces an IgM antibody response against fucosyl GM1 and tumor cells expressing fucosyl GM1 comparable with the response induced by the bovine derivative We plan to combine synthetic fucosyl GM1 vaccine at a dose of 30 microg with vaccines against three other antigens-GM2 Globo H and polysialic acid-to test in patients with SCLC after initial chemotherapy,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[726, 1166, 1317, 31, 1255, 1575, 68, 377, 8, 229, 353, 6, 3, 5173, 1, 5530, 7993, 34, 4, 7, 5, 302, 31, 12, 1334, 94, 4, 1334, 31, 285, 2, 171, 742, 309, 17, 3, 15134, 22229, 23104, 16, 35, 4834, 1145, 112, 283, 8, 324, 38, 45, 264, 3, 1157, 4050, 1, 22229, 2147, 14, 526, 29, 14218, 2326, 3868, 6, 13229, 14073, 14397, 7656, 2, 468, 5, 9347, 239, 249, 21, 650, 3, 4050, 1, 169, 338, 415, 1, 8, 3273, 2256, 1, 22229, 23104, 4, 7, 5, 1334, 50, 8, 458, 51, 6, 388, 36, 3, 86, 396, 741, 10, 6, 1811, 3, 2101, 323, 61, 2787, 1, 1958, 548, 1529, 365, 1, 437, 7, 28, 3, 201, 2440, 61, 2, 169, 1, 365, 7, 28, 3, 79, 2440, 61, 17640, 2852, 253, 1, 14, 493, 15, 378, 46, 890, 11, 557, 20, 1412, 1914, 4, 648, 1, 659, 140, 1292, 1, 3, 7, 28, 3, 27, 2440, 61, 42, 6671, 2090, 14, 493, 104, 69, 28, 3, 201, 2440, 61, 42, 35, 3630, 51, 5, 8, 8444, 1, 14, 493, 3, 4210, 29, 437, 1, 3, 659, 1983, 277, 1157, 3731, 517, 1408, 1, 30, 37, 1915, 5, 3, 3273, 22229, 23104, 7656, 3998, 1516, 35, 2852, 548, 51, 480, 22229, 23104, 2, 30, 37, 1046, 22229, 23104, 1279, 5, 3, 51, 277, 20, 3, 14218, 4819, 21, 2242, 6, 4680, 3273, 22229, 23104, 1274, 28, 8, 61, 1, 201, 2440, 5, 1842, 480, 169, 127, 1575, 15240, 21218, 555, 2, 21217, 971, 6, 412, 4, 7, 5, 1334, 50, 388, 56]",1614.0,15447995,4
Breast cancer after childhood cancer: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,Annals of internal medicine,Ann. Intern. Med.,2004-10-01,"Survivors of childhood cancer are at risk for secondary breast cancer. Other than previous chest radiation therapy, risk factors for secondary breast cancer have not been established. To identify risk factors for breast cancer among female survivors of childhood cancer. Retrospective cohort study. The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS), a multicenter study of persons who survived more than 5 years after childhood cancer diagnosed from 1970 to 1986. Among 6068 women in the CCSS, 95 women had 111 confirmed cases of breast cancer. Standardized incidence ratios for breast cancer were calculated by using age-specific incidence rates in the general population. Breast cancer incidence was evaluated with respect to primary cancer diagnosis and therapy, age at and time since primary diagnosis, menstrual and reproductive history, and family history of cancer. Breast cancer risk was increased in survivors who were treated with chest radiation therapy (standardized incidence ratio, 24.7 [95% CI, 19.3 to 31.0]) and survivors of bone and soft-tissue sarcoma who were not treated with chest radiation therapy (standardized incidence ratios, 6.7 and 7.6, respectively). Family history of breast cancer (relative rate, 2.7 [CI, 1.3 to 5.0]) and history of thyroid disease (relative rate, 1.7 [CI, 1.1 to 2.6]) were independently associated with increased risk, and exposure to pelvic radiation was protective (relative rate, 0.6 [CI, 0.4 to 0.9]). Age at primary cancer diagnosis and menstrual and reproductive histories did not statistically significantly modify risk.

Silencing of the maternally imprinted tumor suppressor ARHI contributes to follicular thyroid carcinogenesis.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2004-11-16,"The two most common subtypes of thyroid cancer, follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) and papillary thyroid carcinoma, have been extensively studied, but our fundamental understanding of the molecular events in thyroid epithelial oncogenesis is still limited. Unreported data from our previous published global gene expression analysis revealed that the tumor suppressor gene aplysia ras homolog I (ARHI) is frequently underexpressed in FTCs. In this study, we elucidated the frequency and mechanism of ARHI silencing in benign and malignant thyroid neoplasia. We demonstrated that underexpression of ARHI occurs principally in FTCs (P = 0.0018), including its oncocytic variant (11 of 13), even at minimally invasive stage but not classic papillary thyroid carcinoma (two of seven) or follicular adenoma (FA) (three of 14). FTCs show strong allelic imbalance with reduction in copy number/loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 69%, compared with less than 10% for FAs. In combination with our LOH data, bisulfite sequencing in a subset of samples revealed that FA displays a symmetric methylation pattern, likely representing one unmethylated allele and one presumptively imprinted allele, whereas FTC shows a virtually complete methylation pattern, representing LOH of the nonimprinted allele with only the hypermethylated allele remaining. Furthermore, we showed that pharmacologic inhibition of histone deacetylation but not demethylation could reactivate ARHI expression in the FTC133 FTC cell line. Therefore, our data suggest that silencing of the putative maternally imprinted tumor suppressor gene ARHI, primarily by large genomic deletion in conjunction with hypermethylation of the genomically imprinted allele, serves as a key early event in follicular thyroid carcinogenesis.",Journal Article,5544.0,45.0,The two most common subtypes of cancer follicular carcinoma FTC and papillary carcinoma have been extensively studied but our fundamental understanding of the molecular events in epithelial oncogenesis is still limited Unreported data from our previous published global gene expression analysis revealed that the tumor suppressor gene aplysia ras homolog I ARHI is frequently underexpressed in FTCs In this study we elucidated the frequency and mechanism of ARHI silencing in benign and malignant neoplasia We demonstrated that underexpression of ARHI occurs principally in FTCs P 0.0018 including its oncocytic variant 11 of 13 even at minimally invasive stage but not classic papillary carcinoma two of seven or follicular adenoma FA three of 14 FTCs show strong allelic imbalance with reduction in copy number/loss of heterozygosity LOH in 69 compared with less than 10 for FAs In combination with our LOH data bisulfite sequencing in a subset of samples revealed that FA displays a symmetric methylation pattern likely representing one unmethylated allele and one presumptively imprinted allele whereas FTC shows a virtually complete methylation pattern representing LOH of the nonimprinted allele with only the hypermethylated allele remaining Furthermore we showed that pharmacologic inhibition of histone deacetylation but not demethylation could reactivate ARHI expression in the FTC133 FTC cell line Therefore our data suggest that silencing of the putative maternally imprinted tumor suppressor gene ARHI primarily by large genomic deletion in conjunction with hypermethylation of the genomically imprinted allele serves as a key early event in follicular carcinogenesis,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[3, 100, 96, 186, 814, 1, 12, 1974, 134, 8527, 2, 1796, 134, 47, 85, 3576, 656, 84, 114, 4595, 612, 1, 3, 219, 281, 4, 701, 4503, 16, 1234, 383, 10046, 74, 29, 114, 698, 983, 1648, 145, 55, 65, 553, 17, 3, 30, 1245, 145, 43781, 1102, 3412, 70, 4569, 16, 746, 15532, 4, 19572, 4, 26, 45, 21, 3901, 3, 675, 2, 670, 1, 4569, 2077, 4, 1002, 2, 393, 2298, 21, 264, 17, 22250, 1, 4569, 1780, 10257, 4, 19572, 19, 13, 11995, 141, 211, 17287, 1142, 175, 1, 233, 871, 28, 2144, 416, 82, 84, 44, 3168, 1796, 134, 100, 1, 648, 15, 1974, 2434, 4307, 169, 1, 213, 19572, 514, 1082, 3861, 6088, 5, 628, 4, 1337, 207, 407, 1, 3963, 2594, 4, 790, 72, 5, 299, 76, 79, 9, 3625, 4, 150, 5, 114, 2594, 74, 6181, 615, 4, 8, 697, 1, 347, 553, 17, 4307, 7196, 8, 28312, 569, 1177, 322, 2861, 104, 8100, 1254, 2, 104, 37810, 9268, 1254, 547, 8527, 1949, 8, 5860, 236, 569, 1177, 2861, 2594, 1, 3, 43782, 1254, 5, 158, 3, 6936, 1254, 1844, 798, 21, 224, 17, 2788, 297, 1, 1508, 15191, 84, 44, 6800, 359, 15647, 4569, 55, 4, 3, 43783, 8527, 31, 328, 673, 114, 74, 309, 17, 2077, 1, 3, 2743, 19566, 9268, 30, 1245, 145, 4569, 1561, 20, 375, 572, 1528, 4, 3357, 5, 2575, 1, 3, 7218, 9268, 1254, 4711, 22, 8, 825, 191, 774, 4, 1974, 1719]",1680.0,15546898,243
A central domain of cyclin D1 mediates nuclear receptor corepressor activity.,Oncogene,Oncogene,2005-01-01,"Regulation of nuclear receptor activity is the focus of numerous ongoing studies to develop novel therapies for the treatment of hormone-related cancer. Although cyclin D1 functions to control the activity of several nuclear receptors, the region(s) of the protein responsible for such transcriptional comodulation remain poorly defined. Herein, we map the region of cyclin D1 required for binding and repression of the androgen receptor (AR) to a central, exclusively alpha-helical domain. Deletion of this domain disrupted AR binding and corepressor activity. Further investigations showed that this domain is sufficient for AR interaction and possesses the ability to bind histone deacetylase 3. Strikingly, overexpression of this repressor region attenuates cell cycle progression in prostatic adenocarcinoma cells. The requirement of this domain for nuclear receptor repression was conserved with respect to thyroid hormone receptor beta-1, whereas cyclin D1 activation of the estrogen receptor occurred independently of the central region. Together, these data identify a minimal repression module within cyclin D1 and demonstrate that the coactivator and corepressor functions of cyclin D1 are distinct. In addition, our data suggest that properties of the cyclin D1 central domain could be exploited to develop novel prostate cancer therapeutics.",Journal Article,5498.0,52.0,Regulation of nuclear receptor activity is the focus of numerous ongoing studies to develop novel therapies for the treatment of hormone-related cancer Although cyclin D1 functions to control the activity of several nuclear receptors the region s of the protein responsible for such transcriptional comodulation remain poorly defined Herein we map the region of cyclin D1 required for binding and repression of the androgen receptor AR to a central exclusively alpha-helical domain Deletion of this domain disrupted AR binding and corepressor activity Further investigations showed that this domain is sufficient for AR interaction and possesses the ability to bind histone deacetylase 3 Strikingly overexpression of this repressor region attenuates cell cycle progression in prostatic adenocarcinoma cells The requirement of this domain for nuclear receptor repression was conserved with respect to hormone receptor beta-1 whereas cyclin D1 activation of the estrogen receptor occurred independently of the central region Together these data identify a minimal repression module within cyclin D1 and demonstrate that the coactivator and corepressor functions of cyclin D1 are distinct In addition our data suggest that properties of the cyclin D1 central domain could be exploited to develop novel cancer therapeutics,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[863, 1, 928, 153, 128, 16, 3, 1222, 1, 2331, 942, 94, 6, 690, 229, 235, 9, 3, 24, 1, 785, 139, 12, 242, 1226, 2146, 1681, 6, 182, 3, 128, 1, 392, 928, 1186, 3, 1053, 695, 1, 3, 178, 2327, 9, 225, 1431, 43787, 918, 1240, 395, 1986, 21, 3771, 3, 1053, 1, 1226, 2146, 616, 9, 791, 2, 5255, 1, 3, 687, 153, 754, 6, 8, 854, 4437, 950, 6638, 1398, 1528, 1, 26, 1398, 5576, 754, 791, 2, 15931, 128, 195, 2492, 224, 17, 26, 1398, 16, 1952, 9, 754, 915, 2, 9857, 3, 801, 6, 4060, 1508, 2732, 27, 6787, 851, 1, 26, 7434, 1053, 9100, 31, 417, 91, 4, 3329, 449, 37, 3, 4701, 1, 26, 1398, 9, 928, 153, 5255, 10, 5547, 5, 2184, 6, 785, 153, 1090, 14, 547, 1226, 2146, 363, 1, 3, 808, 153, 489, 1042, 1, 3, 854, 1053, 1162, 46, 74, 255, 8, 1048, 5255, 5980, 262, 1226, 2146, 2, 608, 17, 3, 8777, 2, 15931, 1681, 1, 1226, 2146, 32, 834, 4, 352, 114, 74, 309, 17, 1571, 1, 3, 1226, 2146, 854, 1398, 359, 40, 5177, 6, 690, 229, 12, 1943]",1318.0,15558026,272

We hypothesized that the basal and TSH-stimulated Tg levels in patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma would reflect tumor volume, histological subtype, and location of metastatic lesions. A retrospective review of 417 thyroid cancer survivors undergoing evaluation for residual disease with the assistance of recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) was performed. In 169 patients with metastatic disease, we found that the basal Tg level directly correlated with the number of lesions, and that it was highest in patients with follicular and lowest in those with papillary thyroid carcinoma. The basal Tg level was highest in patients with bone metastases and lowest in those with cervical metastases. The fold increase in the serum Tg after rhTSH treatment was highest in papillary thyroid carcinoma and lowest in Hurthle cell carcinoma. The fold increase in Tg was not influenced by tumor volume or by the site of metastatic lesions. Multivariate analysis showed multiple interactions between factors, but did not identify one factor that significantly influenced basal Tg or fold increase.

Evaluation of germline PTEN mutations in endometrial cancer patients.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2005-01-01,"Cowden Syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple hamartomas, increased risks of breast and thyroid cancers, and possibly endometrial carcinoma. Susceptibility to Cowden syndrome is conferred by germline mutation of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene, and somatic mutations of PTEN are common in sporadic endometrial carcinomas. The aim of this study was to test whether a substantial proportion of endometrial cancers are associated with germline mutations of the PTEN gene, not necessarily in association with clinically overt Cowden syndrome. A retrospective cohort of 240 consecutive patients with pathologically confirmed endometrial carcinoma diagnosed at our institution from 1999 to 2002 was ascertained for study. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes and the entire PTEN coding region and exon-intron junctions were screened for mutations by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis.

"Familial polyposis coli: clinical manifestations, evaluation, management and treatment.","The Mount Sinai journal of medicine, New York",Mt. Sinai J. Med.,2004-11-01,"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant, hereditary colon cancer syndrome that is characterized by the presence of innumerable adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum. Gardner's syndrome is a variant of FAP, which in addition to the colonic polyps, also presents extracolonic manifestations, including desmoid tumors, osteomas, epidermoid cysts, various soft tissue tumors, and a predisposition to thyroid and periampullary cancers. Mutations of the APC gene are thought to be responsible for the development of FAP, and the location of the mutation on the gene is thought to influence the nature of the extracolonic manifestations that a given patient might develop. Though patients are often asymptomatic, bleeding, diarrhea, abdominal pain and mucous discharge frequently occur. Diagnostic tools include genetic testing, endoscopy, and monitoring for extra-intestinal manifestations. Currently, surgery is the only effective means of preventing progression to colorectal carcinoma. Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (RPC/IPAA) with mucosectomy is the preferred surgical procedure, since it attempts to eliminate all colorectal mucosa without the need for an ostomy. Periampullary carcinoma and intra-abdominal desmoid tumors are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients after colectomy. Frequent endoscopy is needed to prevent the former, while there is no definitive treatment available yet for the latter.

The expression of EGFR was determined in ATC in vitro and in vivo and in human tissue arrays of ATC. We assessed the potential of the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib (""Iressa,"" ZD1839) to inhibit EGFR activation in vitro and in vivo, inhibit ATC cellular proliferation, induce apoptosis, and reduce the growth of ATC cells in vivo when administered alone and in combination with paclitaxel. EGFR was overexpressed in ATC cell lines in vitro and in vivo and in human ATC specimens. Activation of EGFR by EGF was blocked by the addition of gefitinib. In vitro studies showed that gefitinib greatly inhibited cellular proliferation and induced apoptosis in ATC cell lines and slowed tumor growth in a nude mouse model of thyroid carcinoma cells injected subcutaneously. ATC cells consistently overexpress EGFR, rendering this receptor a potential target for molecular therapy.

For this retrospective chart review study, 1136 women with primary breast carcinoma (PBC) were identified from the authors' departmental data base. These women (cases) were frequency-matched for age (+/- 5 years) and ethnicity with 1088 healthy participants (controls) who attended a breast carcinona screening clinic. Women with HYPT who were receiving thyroid-replacement therapy before they were diagnosed with breast carcinoma or before the screening visit were identified. The mean ages of cases and controls (51.6 years vs. 51.0 years, respectively; P = 0.30) and their menopausal status (65.4% premenopausal vs. 62% postmenopausal; P = 0.10) were comparable. Two hundred forty-two women in the case group (10.9%) with HYPT were identified. The prevalence of this condition was significantly greater the control group compared with the case group (14.9% vs. 7.0%, respectively; P < 0.001). PBC patients were 57% less likely to have HYPT compared with their healthy counterparts (odds ratio, 0.43l 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.57). Seventy-eight white patients with PBC had HYPT and, compared with women who were euthyroid, they were older at the time of diagnosis (58.8 years vs. 51.1 years; P < 0.001), were more likely to have localized disease (95.0% vs. 85.9% clinical T1 or T2 disease, respectively; P = 0.025), and were more likely to have no pathologic lymph node involvement (62.8% vs. 54.4%; P = 0.15).

Genetic classification of benign and malignant thyroid follicular neoplasia based on a three-gene combination.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2005-02-15,"Thyroid carcinoma is a common endocrine cancer with a favorable prognosis if subjected to timely treatment. However, the clinical identification of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) among patients with benign thyroid nodules is still a challenge. Preoperative fine needle aspiration-based cytology cannot always differentiate follicular carcinomas from benign follicular neoplasias. Because current methods fail to improve preoperative diagnosis of thyroid nodules, new molecular-based diagnoses should be explored. We conducted a microarray-based study to reveal the genetic profiles unique to FTC and follicular adenomas (FAs), to identify the most parsimonious number of genes that could accurately differentiate between benign and malignant follicular thyroid neoplasia. We confirmed our data by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry in two independent validation sets with a total of 114 samples. We were able to identify three genes, cyclin D2 (CCND2), protein convertase 2 (PCSK2), and prostate differentiation factor (PLAB), that allow the accurate molecular classification of FTC and FA. Two independent validation sets revealed that the combination of these three genes could differentiate FTC from FA with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 94.7%, and accuracy of 96.7%. In addition, our model allowed the identification of follicular variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma with an accuracy of 85.7%. Three-gene profiling of thyroid nodules can accurately predict the diagnosis of FTC and FA with high sensitivity and specificity, thus identifying promising targets for further investigation to ultimately improve preoperative diagnosis.",Journal Article,5453.0,129.0,carcinoma is a common endocrine cancer with a favorable prognosis if subjected to timely treatment However the clinical identification of follicular carcinoma FTC among patients with benign nodules is still a challenge Preoperative fine needle aspiration-based cytology can not always differentiate follicular carcinomas from benign follicular neoplasias Because current methods fail to improve preoperative diagnosis of nodules new molecular-based diagnoses should be explored We conducted a microarray-based study to reveal the genetic profiles unique to FTC and follicular adenomas FAs to identify the most parsimonious number of genes that could accurately differentiate between benign and malignant follicular neoplasia We confirmed our data by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry in two independent validation sets with a total of 114 samples We were able to identify three genes cyclin D2 CCND2 protein convertase 2 PCSK2 and differentiation factor PLAB that allow the accurate molecular classification of FTC and FA Two independent validation sets revealed that the combination of these three genes could differentiate FTC from FA with a sensitivity of 100 specificity of 94.7 and accuracy of 96.7 In addition our model allowed the identification of follicular variants of papillary carcinoma with an accuracy of 85.7 Three-gene profiling of nodules can accurately predict the diagnosis of FTC and FA with high sensitivity and specificity thus identifying promising targets for further investigation to ultimately improve preoperative diagnosis,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[134, 16, 8, 186, 1293, 12, 5, 8, 913, 356, 492, 4325, 6, 4225, 24, 137, 3, 38, 911, 1, 1974, 134, 8527, 107, 7, 5, 1002, 2597, 16, 1234, 8, 1745, 498, 2924, 2177, 3256, 90, 2045, 122, 44, 3763, 3723, 1974, 826, 29, 1002, 1974, 8235, 408, 291, 636, 4373, 6, 401, 498, 147, 1, 2597, 217, 219, 90, 2403, 257, 40, 1443, 21, 426, 8, 1727, 90, 45, 6, 2396, 3, 336, 1241, 991, 6, 8527, 2, 1974, 2751, 3625, 6, 255, 3, 96, 18393, 207, 1, 214, 17, 359, 2141, 3723, 59, 1002, 2, 393, 1974, 2298, 21, 557, 114, 74, 20, 1156, 240, 604, 2, 888, 4, 100, 306, 929, 2270, 5, 8, 181, 1, 3803, 347, 21, 11, 1665, 6, 255, 169, 214, 1226, 4171, 14891, 178, 43857, 18, 54620, 2, 910, 161, 54621, 17, 1700, 3, 1481, 219, 947, 1, 8527, 2, 4307, 100, 306, 929, 2270, 553, 17, 3, 150, 1, 46, 169, 214, 359, 3723, 8527, 29, 4307, 5, 8, 485, 1, 394, 1121, 1, 960, 67, 2, 1190, 1, 921, 67, 4, 352, 114, 202, 2313, 3, 911, 1, 1974, 839, 1, 1796, 134, 5, 35, 1190, 1, 772, 67, 169, 145, 1080, 1, 2597, 122, 2141, 678, 3, 147, 1, 8527, 2, 4307, 5, 64, 485, 2, 1121, 631, 1386, 721, 637, 9, 195, 940, 6, 2050, 401, 498, 147]",1561.0,15713710,372
"Immunohistochemical staining in the diagnosis of pancreatobiliary and ampulla of Vater adenocarcinoma: application of CDX2, CK17, MUC1, and MUC2.",The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2005-03-01,"Pancreatobiliary and ampulla of Vater adenocarcinomas frequently metastasize to regional lymph nodes, liver, or lung and are difficult to diagnose because they lack specific immunohistochemical markers. We studied the expression of cytokeratin 7 (CK7), cytokeratin 17 (CK17), cytokeratin 20 (CK20), CDX2, mucin 1 (MUC1), mucin 2 (MUC2), and mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) in 46 cases of pancreatic ductal carcinoma, 18 ampulla of Vater adenocarcinomas, and 24 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. The expression of MUC1 and CK17 was restricted to pancreatic ductal carcinoma (41 of 46, 89%; 38 of 46, 83%, respectively), the ampullary carcinoma of pancreatobiliary origin (6 of 6, 100%; 5 of 6, 83%, respectively), and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (20 of 24, 83%; 17 of 24, 71%, respectively). More than 50% of cases of pancreatobiliary adenocarcinomas showed diffuse cytoplasmic CK17 positivity. In contrast, less than 5% cases (8 of 184) of extra-pancreatobiliary nonmucinous adenocarcinomas expressed CK17, and only 3 of them showed diffuse CK17 positivity. The expression of MUC2 and CDX2 was restricted to the intestinal, mucinous, and signet-ring cell-type adenocarcinomas of duodenal papillary origin (9 of 11, 82%; 11 of 11, 100%, respectively). MUC2 was rarely expressed in pancreatic ductal carcinoma (1 of 46, 2%) and was negative in the ampullary carcinoma of pancreatobiliary origin and in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. A heterogeneous CDX2 staining pattern was seen in 1 of 6 cases of the ampullary carcinoma of pancreatobiliary origin (17%), 5 of 24 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (21%), and 10 of 46 (22%) pancreatic ductal carcinomas. In contrast, all 11 cases of the intestinal, mucinous, and signet-ring cell-type adenocarcinomas of duodenal papillary origin showed homogeneous CDX2 nuclear positivity. We concluded that CK17 is a useful marker in separating pancreatobiliary adenocarcinomas from extra-pancreatobiliary nonmucinous adenocarcinomas, including adenocarcinomas from the colon, breast, gynecologic organs, stomach, lung, prostate, thyroid, kidney, and adrenal gland, and malignant mesothelioma. MUC1+/CK17+ can be used as positive markers for pancreatic ductal carcinomas, the ampullary carcinoma of pancreatobiliary origin, and cholangiocarcinomas with positive predictive values of 76%, 83%, and 58%, respectively.

"Aneurysmal bone cyst variant translocations upregulate USP6 transcription by promoter swapping with the ZNF9, COL1A1, TRAP150, and OMD genes.",Oncogene,Oncogene,2005-05-01,"Aneurysmal bone cysts (ABC) are locally aggressive bone tumors that often feature chromosome 17p13 rearrangements. One of the ABC 17p13 rearrangements--t(16;17)(q22;p13)--was recently shown to create a CDH11-USP6 fusion in which the USP6/TRE17 oncogene is overexpressed through juxtaposition with the CDH11 promoter. Herein, we characterize four different ABC translocations involving 17p13, and we show that each is associated with a novel USP6 fusion oncogene. Specifically, we demonstrate that t(1;17), t(3;17), t(9;17), and t(17;17) result in USP6 fusions with TRAP150 (thyroid receptor-associated protein 150), ZNF9 (ZiNc Finger 9), Osteomodulin, and COL1A1 (Collagen 1A1), respectively. The oncogenic mechanism in these fusion genes is akin to CDH11-USP6, with the USP6 coding sequences juxtaposed to the promoter regions in each of the four novel translocation partners. The novel fusion partners appear well suited to drive USP6 transcription in the bone/mesenchymal context: osteomodulin is expressed strongly in osteoblastic lineages, and the COL1A1 promoter has an oncogenic role in the mesenchymal cancer dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.

Primary thyroid cancer after a first tumour in childhood (the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study): a nested case-control study.,"Lancet (London, England)",Lancet,,"Survivors of malignant disease in childhood who have had radiotherapy to the head, neck, or upper thorax have an increased risk of subsequent primary thyroid cancer, but the magnitude of risk over the therapeutic dose range has not been well established. We aimed to quantify the long-term risk of thyroid cancer after radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In a nested case-control study, 69 cases with pathologically confirmed thyroid cancer and 265 matched controls without thyroid cancer were identified from 14,054 5-year survivors of cancer during childhood from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort. Childhood cancers were diagnosed between 1970 and 1986 with cohort follow-up to 2000. Risk of thyroid cancer increased with radiation doses up to 20-29 Gy (odds ratio 9.8 [95% CI 3.2-34.8]). At doses greater than 30 Gy, a fall in the dose-response relation was seen. Both the increased and decreased risks were more pronounced in those diagnosed with a first primary malignant disease before age 10 years than in those older than 10 years. Furthermore, the fall in risk remained when those diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma were excluded. Chemotherapy for the first cancer was not associated with thyroid-cancer risk, and it did not modify the effect of radiotherapy. 29 (42%) cases had a first diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma compared with 49 (19%) controls. 11 (42%) of those who had Hodgkin's lymphoma had subsequent thyroid cancers smaller than 1 cm compared with six (17%) of those who had other types of childhood cancer (p=0.07). The reduction in radiation dose-response for risk of thyroid cancer after childhood exposure to thyroid doses higher than 30 Gy is consistent with a cell-killing effect.

"Regulation of JAK2 protein expression by chronic, pulsatile GH administration in vivo: a possible mechanism for ligand enhancement of signal transduction.",General and comparative endocrinology,Gen. Comp. Endocrinol.,2005-07-01,"Growth hormone (GH) is a key factor controlling postnatal growth and development. Despite growth-promoting effects in mammals, GH is not associated with muscle growth in the chicken. Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) has been identified as the first intracellular step in GH receptor (GHR) signaling in many species, however, there is limited knowledge regarding the GH signaling pathway in the chicken. In this study, GH-responsive, JAK2 immunoreactive proteins were first assessed in an avian hepatoma cell line (LMH). Tyrosine phosphorylation of a 120-122 kDa JAK2 immunoreactive protein was GH dose-dependent. In addition to in vitro studies, the timecourse of JAK2 activation in liver and skeletal muscle (Pectoralis superficialis) in response to a single intravenous (i.v.) injection of chicken GH (cGH), and the effect of chronic exposure to GH in a physiologically relevant pattern on JAK2 protein expression and tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo were assessed. At a dose of GH that was previously demonstrated to elicit a maximal metabolic response (6.25 microg/kg BW), maximum tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 appeared at 10 min post-GH administration in the pectoralis muscle, but was not detectable in liver. To assess whether chronic enhancement of GH would alter expression of JAK2, we utilized a dynamic model of pulsatile GH infusion that mimicked the early pattern of circulating GH expressed in younger, rapidly growing birds (high amplitude peaks with an inter-peak interval of 90 min). A 120-122 kDa protein in liver and muscle, and a dominant 130-136 kDa protein in the muscle, that was phosphorylated in response to GH, were specifically recognized by the JAK2 antibody. Chronic, pulsatile infusion of cGH into 8-week-old chickens was associated with increased abundance and tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 protein in both liver and muscle (P < 0.05), which were GH dose-dependent, and mirrored previously reported biological responses for the same birds [Vasilatos-Younken, R., Zhou, Y., Wang, X., McMurtry, J.P., Rosebrough, R.W., Decuypere, E., Buys, N., Darras, V.M., Van Der Geyten, S., Tomas, F., 2000. Altered chicken thyroid hormone metabolism with chronic GH enhancement in vivo: Consequences for skeletal muscle growth. Journal of Endocrinology 166, 609-620.]. In summary (1) JAK2 immunoreactive proteins that associate with the GHR and are tyrosine phosphorylated in response to GH were identified in an avian hepatoma cell line and expressed in both GH responsive (liver) and ""non-responsive"" (skeletal muscle) tissues; (2) tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 occurred within minutes of exposure to a single i.v. injection of GH in vivo in muscle but not liver of 8-week-old birds; and 3) there were GH dose-dependent increases in abundance of JAK2 protein and tyrosine phosphorylation in both tissues when chronically exposed to GH in a physiologically relevant pattern, that mirrored dose-dependent biological responses, including alterations in the pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism, previously reported. Enhanced JAK2 suggests one possible mechanism whereby chronic, physiologically appropriate exposure to the ligand enhances GH biological action via increased abundance of a key upstream component of the signal transduction pathway.",Journal Article,5317.0,8.0,Growth hormone GH is a key factor controlling postnatal growth and development Despite growth-promoting effects in mammals GH is not associated with muscle growth in the chicken Janus kinase 2 JAK2 has been identified as the first intracellular step in GH receptor GHR signaling in many species however there is limited knowledge regarding the GH signaling pathway in the chicken In this study GH-responsive JAK2 immunoreactive proteins were first assessed in an avian hepatoma cell line LMH Tyrosine phosphorylation of a 120-122 kDa JAK2 immunoreactive protein was GH dose-dependent In addition to in vitro studies the timecourse of JAK2 activation in and skeletal muscle Pectoralis superficialis in response to a single intravenous i.v injection of chicken GH cGH and the effect of chronic exposure to GH in a physiologically relevant pattern on JAK2 protein expression and tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo were assessed At a dose of GH that was previously demonstrated to elicit a maximal metabolic response 6.25 microg/kg BW maximum tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 appeared at 10 min post-GH administration in the pectoralis muscle but was not detectable in To assess whether chronic enhancement of GH would alter expression of JAK2 we utilized a dynamic model of pulsatile GH infusion that mimicked the early pattern of circulating GH expressed in younger rapidly growing birds high amplitude peaks with an inter-peak interval of 90 min A 120-122 kDa protein in and muscle and a dominant 130-136 kDa protein in the muscle that was phosphorylated in response to GH were specifically recognized by the JAK2 antibody Chronic pulsatile infusion of cGH into 8-week-old chickens was associated with increased abundance and tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 protein in both and muscle P 0.05 which were GH dose-dependent and mirrored previously reported biological responses for the same birds Vasilatos-Younken R.

Autoimmune toxicities associated with the administration of antitumor vaccines and low-dose interleukin-2.,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",J. Immunother.,,"The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the occurrence of autoimmune toxicities associated with the administration of low-dose IL-2 in conjunction with vaccines for melanoma. Ninety-three patients with stage IIB, III, or IV melanoma were enrolled in three clinical trials and received anti-melanoma vaccines on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, and 43. The vaccines comprised peptide-pulsed dendritic cells, autologous tumor cells with GM-CSF in Montanide ISA-51, or synthetic peptides with GM-CSF in Montanide ISA-51. In conjunction with the vaccines, all patients were administered 3 x 10(6) IU/m2/d IL-2 subcutaneously for 42 days, either days 8 to 49 or 29 to 70. Clinical and laboratory data from these studies were reviewed in aggregate to evaluate the occurrence of autoimmune toxicities. Of 91 evaluable patients, vitiligo was documented in 6 patients (7%). In addition, one patient experienced transient severe insulin-dependent diabetes that resolved after discontinuing IL-2, and another experienced an exacerbation of his pre-existing diabetes; these occurrences are consistent with an autoimmune insulitis. Four occurrences (4%) of transient minor ocular toxicity were documented, but no autoimmune ocular toxicities or changes in visual acuity were found. Of 55 evaluable patients, 14 experienced thyroid abnormalities (25%). These were attributed to an autoimmune thyroiditis, which was supported by findings of antithyroid antibodies in three of the seven patients evaluated. Overall, autoimmune toxicities affecting several organ systems were observed in patients receiving melanoma vaccines in conjunction with low-dose IL-2. None of these toxicities caused major long-term effects, though one was acutely life-threatening and others contributed to treatment-related morbidity. Peptide- or cell-based vaccines administered in combination with low-dose IL-2 appear to be capable of breaking tolerance to self-antigens; despite the associated toxicities, these combinations may still be useful to administer as an immunotherapy for cancer.

RET proto-oncogene: a review and update of genotype-phenotype correlations in hereditary medullary thyroid cancer and associated endocrine tumors.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2005-06-01,"Hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is caused by autosomal dominant gain-of-function mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. Associations between specific RET mutations (genotype) and the aggressiveness of MTC and presence or absence of other endocrine neoplasms (phenotype) are well documented. Mutations in six exons (10, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16) located in either cysteine-rich or tyrosine kinase domains cause one of three distinctive clinical subtypes: familial MTC, multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2A (including variants with Hirschsprung's disease and cutaneous lichen amyloidosis), and MEN 2B. Hallmarks of MEN 2A include MTC, pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism. MEN 2B is associated with an earlier onset of MTC and pheochromocytoma, the absence of hyperparathyroidism, and the presence of striking physical stigmata (e.g., coarse facies, ganglioneuromatosis, and marfanoid habitus). Familial MTC is not associated with other endocrine neoplasms; however, the accurate distinction between familial MTC and MEN 2A may be difficult in kindreds with small size, incomplete histories, or a predominance of young individuals who may not have yet fully manifested the syndrome. Genetic testing detects greater than 95% of mutation carriers and is considered the standard of care for all first-degree relatives of patients with newly diagnosed MTC. Recommendations on the timing of prophylactic thyroidectomy and the extent of surgery are based upon a model that utilizes genotype- phenotype correlations to stratify mutations into three risk levels.",Journal Article,5347.0,210.0,Hereditary medullary carcinoma MTC is caused by autosomal dominant gain-of-function mutations in the RET proto-oncogene Associations between specific RET mutations genotype and the aggressiveness of MTC and presence or absence of other endocrine neoplasms phenotype are well documented Mutations in six exons 10 11 13 14 15 and 16 located in either cysteine-rich or tyrosine kinase domains cause one of three distinctive clinical subtypes familial MTC multiple endocrine neoplasia MEN type 2A including variants with Hirschsprung 's disease and cutaneous lichen amyloidosis and MEN 2B Hallmarks of MEN 2A include MTC and hyperparathyroidism MEN 2B is associated with an earlier onset of MTC and the absence of hyperparathyroidism and the presence of striking physical stigmata e.g. coarse facies ganglioneuromatosis and marfanoid habitus Familial MTC is not associated with other endocrine neoplasms however the accurate distinction between familial MTC and MEN 2A may be difficult in kindreds with small size incomplete histories or a predominance of young individuals who may not have yet fully manifested the syndrome Genetic testing detects greater than 95 of mutation carriers and is considered the standard of care for all first-degree relatives of patients with newly diagnosed MTC Recommendations on the timing of prophylactic thyroidectomy and the extent of surgery are based upon a model that utilizes genotype- phenotype correlations to stratify mutations into three risk levels,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[2305, 4564, 134, 3959, 16, 1546, 20, 6084, 2156, 1803, 1, 343, 138, 4, 3, 2412, 4976, 1836, 685, 59, 112, 2412, 138, 1183, 2, 3, 3908, 1, 3959, 2, 463, 15, 1127, 1, 127, 1293, 1179, 1005, 32, 149, 1405, 138, 4, 437, 3885, 79, 175, 233, 213, 167, 2, 245, 2308, 4, 361, 6943, 3697, 15, 564, 216, 2703, 708, 104, 1, 169, 5049, 38, 814, 2200, 3959, 232, 1293, 2298, 325, 267, 4707, 141, 839, 5, 30234, 292, 34, 2, 1486, 14899, 3919, 2, 325, 3381, 7693, 1, 325, 4707, 643, 3959, 2, 9630, 325, 3381, 16, 41, 5, 35, 1677, 1707, 1, 3959, 2, 3, 1127, 1, 9630, 2, 3, 463, 1, 5133, 900, 22208, 563, 499, 26236, 44041, 37980, 2, 44042, 23459, 2200, 3959, 16, 44, 41, 5, 127, 1293, 1179, 137, 3, 1481, 6628, 59, 2200, 3959, 2, 325, 4707, 68, 40, 1740, 4, 10141, 5, 302, 444, 2610, 5329, 15, 8, 7593, 1, 1169, 869, 54, 68, 44, 47, 1145, 1910, 6023, 3, 681, 336, 471, 6887, 378, 76, 48, 1, 258, 1316, 2, 16, 515, 3, 260, 1, 165, 9, 62, 157, 1444, 3335, 1, 7, 5, 732, 265, 3959, 883, 23, 3, 1972, 1, 1862, 5949, 2, 3, 1039, 1, 152, 32, 90, 1548, 8, 202, 17, 9639, 1183, 1005, 2553, 6, 3570, 138, 237, 169, 43, 148]",1489.0,16029119,319
Familial risks for nonmedullary thyroid cancer.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol.

We wanted to define familial risks for histopathology-specific nonmedullary thyroid cancers through parental and sibling probands. The study examines the nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database on 10.5 million individuals, containing families with parents and offspring. Cancer data were retrieved from the Swedish Cancer Registry from years 1958 to 2002, including 3292 patients with thyroid adenocarcinoma. The Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine histology was available from 1993 onward, with 1449 papillary, 288 follicular, 148 anaplastic, and 68 Hurthle cell tumors. Familial risk for offspring was defined through standardized incidence ratio, adjusted for many variables. The familial risk for papillary carcinoma was 3.21 and 6.24 when a parent and a sibling, respectively, were diagnosed with thyroid cancers. There was an apparent gender preference, particularly among sisters, whose risk was 11.19. The risks were highest for early onset cancers. Thyroid adenocarcinoma was shown to be associated with melanoma and connective tissue tumors, and probably also with neurinomas (schwannomas). Associations found in single comparisons with papillary thyroid cancer and other sites included right-sided colon, breast, ovarian, and kidney cancers. Hurthle cell tumors were associated with Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but the numbers of cases were small. The present findings were based on a limited number of cases, but they display a complex and heterogeneous pattern of familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer.

Integrin-linked kinase is a potential therapeutic target for anaplastic thyroid cancer.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2005-08-01,"We investigated integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a focal adhesion serine-threonine protein kinase, as a new molecular target for treating anaplastic thyroid cancer. ILK mediates cell growth and survival signals and is overexpressed in a number of cancers. Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibition of ILK leads to growth arrest and apoptosis of thyroid cancer cells. According to Western blotting, the level of ILK protein was highly expressed in one papillary (NPA187) and four of five (Hth74, DRO, ARO, KAT4, and K4) anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines. Immunohistochemical analysis of a human tissue microarray revealed that ILK was highly expressed in anaplastic thyroid cancer but not in normal human thyroid tissue. Treating thyroid cancer cell lines with a new ILK inhibitor, QLT0267, inhibited epidermal growth factor-induced phosphorylation of AKT, inhibited cell growth, and induced apoptosis in the NPA187, DRO, and K4 cell lines. QLT0267 also inhibited the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated ILK in four of five cell lines. Tumor volumes in mice treated with QLT0267 were significantly reduced compared with those in untreated mice. In immunohistochemical studies, QLT0267 suppressed phosphorylated p-AKT and angiogenesis (i.e., reduced mean vascular density) and induced apoptosis in both tumor cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells of the thyroid DRO xenografts. In summary, we found that ILK expression and activity were elevated in human anaplastic thyroid cancer and ILK inhibition led to growth arrest and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.

"Treatment planning with protons for pediatric retinoblastoma, medulloblastoma, and pelvic sarcoma: how do protons compare with other conformal techniques?","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2005-10-01,"To calculate treatment plans and compare the dose distributions and dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for photon three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), electron therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and standard (nonintensity modulated) proton therapy in three pediatric disease sites. The tumor volumes from 8 patients (3 retinoblastomas, 2 medulloblastomas, and 3 pelvic sarcomas) were studied retrospectively to compare DVHs from proton therapy with 3D-CRT, electron therapy, and IMRT. In retinoblastoma, several planning techniques were analyzed: A single electron appositional beam was compared with a single 3D-CRT lateral beam, a 3D-CRT anterior beam paired with a lateral beam, IMRT, and protons. In medulloblastoma, three posterior fossa irradiation techniques were analyzed: 3D-CRT, IMRT, and protons. Craniospinal irradiation (which consisted of composite plans of both the posterior fossa and craniospinal components) was also evaluated, primarily comparing spinal irradiation using 3D-CRT electrons, 3D-CRT photons, and protons. Lastly, in pelvic sarcoma, 3D-CRT, IMRT, and proton plans were assessed. In retinoblastoma, protons resulted in the best target coverage combined with the most orbital bone sparing (10% was the mean orbital bone volume irradiated at > or =5 Gy for protons vs. 25% for 3D-CRT electrons, 69% for IMRT, 41% for a single 3D lateral beam, 51% for a 3D anterolateral beam with a lens block, and 65% for a 3D anterolateral beam without a lens block). A single appositional electron field was the next best technique followed by other planning approaches. In medulloblastoma, for posterior fossa and craniospinal irradiation, protons resulted in the least dose to the cochlea (for only posterior fossa irradiation at > or =20 Gy, 34% was the mean cochlear volume irradiated for protons, 87% for IMRT, 89% for 3D-CRT) and hypothalamus-pituitary axis (for only posterior fossa irradiation at > or =10 Gy, 21% was the mean hypothalamus-pituitary volume irradiated for protons, 81% for IMRT, 91% for 3D-CRT); additional dose reductions to the optic chiasm, eyes, vertebrae, mandible, thyroid, lung, kidneys, heart, and liver were seen. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy appeared to be the second best technique for posterior fossa irradiation. For spinal irradiation 3D-CRT electrons were better than 3D-CRT photons in sparing dose to the thyroid, heart, lung, kidney, and liver. With pelvic sarcoma, protons were superior in eliminating any dose to the ovaries (0% of mean ovarian volume was irradiated at > or =2 Gy with protons) and to some extent, the pelvic bones and vertebrae. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy did show more bladder dose reduction than the other techniques in pelvic sarcoma irradiation. In the diseases studied, using various techniques of 3D-CRT, electrons, IMRT, and protons, protons are most optimal in treating retinoblastomas, medulloblastomas (posterior fossa and craniospinal), and pelvic sarcomas. Protons delivered superior target dose coverage and sparing of normal structures. As dose-volume parameters are expected to correlate with acute and late toxicity, proton therapy should receive serious consideration as the preferred technique for the treatment of pediatric tumors.",Comparative Study,5225.0,173.0,To calculate treatment plans and compare the dose distributions and dose-volume histograms DVHs for photon three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy 3D-CRT

Variable expression of coxsackie-adenovirus receptor in thyroid tumors: implications for adenoviral gene therapy.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2005-09-01,"Adenoviral gene therapy represents a novel approach for the treatment of aggressive thyroid carcinomas. Both coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR) and integrins have been shown to be the major determinants for adenoviral infectivity in many types of cancer cells, yet conflicting results have been reported. In this report we examine these factors mediating adenoviral infection in thyroid cells and to evaluate CAR expression in various types of thyroid cancer. We found that neither expression levels of CAR nor integrins are solely predictive of adenoviral infectivity in thyroid cells. However, the absence of CAR was associated with poor adenoviral infectivity in immortalized rat FRTL-5 cells. Moreover, preincubation with alpha-CAR antibody decreased infectivity in FTC 238 cells, a human thyroid tumor line. These results indicate that CAR does play a role in adenoviral infection of thyroid cells. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that CAR is expressed at the cell surface in the majority of malignant thyroid tumors. We further show that adenoviral infectivity in some thyroid cancer cells can be improved by poly-L-lysine. Our study warrants a functional method to evaluate adenoviral infectivity should be developed and instituted prior to clinical trials of adenoviral gene therapy in patients with advanced thyroid cancer.",Journal Article,5255.0,11.0,Adenoviral gene therapy represents a novel approach for the treatment of aggressive carcinomas Both coxsackie-adenovirus receptor CAR and integrins have been shown to be the major determinants for adenoviral infectivity in many types of cancer cells yet conflicting results have been reported In this report we examine these factors mediating adenoviral infection in cells and to evaluate CAR expression in various types of cancer We found that neither expression levels of CAR nor integrins are solely predictive of adenoviral infectivity in cells However the absence of CAR was associated with poor adenoviral infectivity in immortalized rat FRTL-5 cells Moreover preincubation with alpha-CAR antibody decreased infectivity in FTC 238 cells a human tumor line These results indicate that CAR does play a role in adenoviral infection of cells Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that CAR is expressed at the cell surface in the majority of malignant tumors We further show that adenoviral infectivity in some cancer cells can be improved by poly-L-lysine Our study warrants a functional method to evaluate adenoviral infectivity should be developed and instituted prior to clinical trials of adenoviral gene therapy in patients with advanced cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[4771, 145, 36, 1449, 8, 229, 353, 9, 3, 24, 1, 571, 826, 110, 24608, 4488, 153, 1881, 2, 6593, 47, 85, 443, 6, 40, 3, 458, 3403, 9, 4771, 15310, 4, 445, 630, 1, 12, 37, 1145, 4274, 99, 47, 85, 210, 4, 26, 414, 21, 1004, 46, 130, 3941, 4771, 930, 4, 37, 2, 6, 376, 1881, 55, 4, 747, 630, 1, 12, 21, 204, 17, 2174, 55, 148, 1, 1881, 2110, 6593, 32, 5558, 464, 1, 4771, 15310, 4, 37, 137, 3, 1127, 1, 1881, 10, 41, 5, 334, 4771, 15310, 4, 6090, 4008, 55089, 33, 37, 1393, 24466, 5, 950, 1881, 548, 340, 15310, 4, 8527, 6883, 37, 8, 171, 30, 328, 46, 99, 1008, 17, 1881, 1097, 1343, 8, 200, 4, 4771, 930, 1, 37, 1382, 65, 553, 17, 1881, 16, 570, 28, 3, 31, 1255, 4, 3, 686, 1, 393, 57, 21, 195, 514, 17, 4771, 15310, 4, 476, 12, 37, 122, 40, 231, 20, 2699, 805, 6041, 114, 45, 2782, 8, 583, 596, 6, 376, 4771, 15310, 257, 40, 276, 2, 12310, 324, 6, 38, 143, 1, 4771, 145, 36, 4, 7, 5, 131, 12]",1251.0,16187905,0
"High frequency of loss of heterozygosity in imprinted, compared with nonimprinted, genomic regions in follicular thyroid carcinomas and atypical adenomas.",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2005-10-25,"Many mammalian genes that are imprinted regulate cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Because imprinting silences one of the two alleles, resulting in functional haploinsufficiency, we hypothesized that loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at an imprinted locus may result in the deletion of the only functional copy of an imprinted tumor suppressor gene. The goal of this study was to specifically address this hypothesis that in thyroid neoplasias loss of imprinted loci becomes enriched during oncogenesis. In total, thyroid tissue was obtained from 72 patients with thyroid neoplasias comprising 34 follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs) and 38 follicular adenomas. We performed PCR-based LOH analysis of DNA from paired normal-tumor samples using 18 markers mapped to imprinted regions (IR) and 13 markers in nonimprinted regions (NIR). Overall LOH frequencies for the IR markers were 26% for the adenomas and 38% for the carcinomas. In the NIR, the overall LOH frequency was 23 and 26% for adenomas and FTCs, respectively. The difference in LOH frequencies between IR and NIR was statistically significant only for the carcinomas (P = 0.001), although there was a similar trend for the atypical adenomas (ATY, P = 0.06). Our observations suggest that IRs are more prone to genomic instability in FTCs.

Activity of irinotecan and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor CEP-751 in medullary thyroid cancer.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2005-11-01,"Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a cancer of the parafollicular C cells that commonly presents with an inherited or acquired RET gene mutation. There is currently no effective systemic treatment for MTC. The objective of this study was to investigate a systemic therapeutic approach to treat MTC. We studied the sensitivity of an MTC cell line and xenograft to irinotecan, alone and in combination with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, CEP-751. In TT cell culture and xenografts, irinotecan treatment was highly effective. This effect was augmented by treatment with CEP-751. Treatment of TT cell xenografts resulted in durable complete remission in 100% of the mice, with median time to recurrence of 70 d for irinotecan alone and more than 130 d for irinotecan plus CEP-751. Although irinotecan induced an S phase checkpoint arrest in TT cells, CEP-751 in combination with irinotecan resulted in a loss of this arrest. CEP-751 induced a loss in the induction of the DNA repair program marked by phospho-H2AX and the checkpoint pathway marked by the activated Chk1 pathway. Irinotecan treatment was highly effective in a preclinical model of human MTC, resulting in complete remission in 100% of the xenografts treated. The duration of remission was further enhanced by combination with the kinase inhibitor, CEP-751. These results suggest that irinotecan, alone or in combination, may be useful for the treatment of MTC.",Journal Article,5194.0,40.0,Medullary cancer MTC is a cancer of the parafollicular C cells that commonly presents with an inherited or acquired RET gene mutation There is currently no effective systemic treatment for MTC The objective of this study was to investigate a systemic therapeutic approach to treat MTC We studied the sensitivity of an MTC cell line and xenograft to irinotecan alone and in combination with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor CEP-751 In TT cell culture and xenografts irinotecan treatment was highly effective This effect was augmented by treatment with CEP-751 Treatment of TT cell xenografts resulted in durable complete remission in 100 of the mice with median time to recurrence of 70 d for irinotecan alone and more than 130 d for irinotecan plus CEP-751 Although irinotecan induced an S phase checkpoint arrest in TT cells CEP-751 in combination with irinotecan resulted in a loss of this arrest CEP-751 induced a loss in the induction of the DNA repair program marked by phospho-H2AX and the checkpoint pathway marked by the activated Chk1 pathway Irinotecan treatment was highly effective in a preclinical model of human MTC resulting in complete remission in 100 of the xenografts treated The duration of remission was further enhanced by combination with the kinase inhibitor CEP-751 These results suggest that irinotecan alone or in combination may be useful for the treatment of MTC,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[4564, 12, 3959, 16, 8, 12, 1, 3, 44147, 256, 37, 17, 841, 2740, 5, 35, 2986, 15, 1294, 2412, 145, 258, 125, 16, 694, 77, 323, 403, 24, 9, 3959, 3, 461, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 963, 8, 403, 189, 353, 6, 943, 3959, 21, 656, 3, 485, 1, 35, 3959, 31, 328, 2, 1330, 6, 1071, 279, 2, 4, 150, 5, 3, 564, 216, 230, 5891, 6351, 4, 3504, 31, 2099, 2, 1348, 1071, 24, 10, 561, 323, 26, 254, 10, 4277, 20, 24, 5, 5891, 6351, 24, 1, 3504, 31, 1348, 627, 4, 1480, 236, 734, 4, 394, 1, 3, 399, 5, 52, 98, 6, 146, 1, 431, 427, 9, 1071, 279, 2, 80, 76, 3431, 427, 9, 1071, 349, 5891, 6351, 242, 1071, 277, 35, 695, 124, 986, 1854, 4, 3504, 37, 5891, 6351, 4, 150, 5, 1071, 627, 4, 8, 407, 1, 26, 1854, 5891, 6351, 277, 8, 407, 4, 3, 504, 1, 3, 261, 972, 1243, 2003, 20, 3125, 6286, 2, 3, 986, 308, 2003, 20, 3, 735, 4638, 308, 1071, 24, 10, 561, 323, 4, 8, 693, 202, 1, 171, 3959, 1113, 4, 236, 734, 4, 394, 1, 3, 1348, 73, 3, 654, 1, 734, 10, 195, 651, 20, 150, 5, 3, 216, 230, 5891, 6351, 46, 99, 309, 17, 1071, 279, 15, 4, 150, 68, 40, 999, 9, 3, 24, 1, 3959]",1388.0,16263812,669
Real-time prognosis for metastatic thyroid carcinoma based on 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography scanning.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2005-11-22,"Approximately 15% of thyroid cancer patients develop subsequent metastases. The clinical course of patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma is highly variable. We hypothesized that the metabolic activity of metastatic lesions, as defined by retention of 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG), would correlate with prognosis. The initial FDG-positron emission tomography (PET) scans from 400 thyroid cancer patients were retrospectively reviewed and compared with overall survival (median follow-up, 7.9 yr). We examined the prognostic value of clinical information such as gender, age, serum thyroglobulin, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, histology, radioiodine avidity, FDG-PET positivity, number of FDG-avid lesions, and the glycolytic rate of the most active lesion. Age, initial stage, histology, thyroglobulin, radioiodine uptake, and PET outcomes all correlated with survival by univariate analysis. However, only age and PET results continued to be strong predictors of survival under multivariate analysis. The initial American Joint Committee on Cancer stage was not a significant predictor of survival by multivariate analysis. There were significant inverse relationships between survival and both the glycolytic rate of the most active lesion and the number of FDG-avid lesions. FDG-PET scanning is a simple, expensive, but powerful means to restage thyroid cancer patients who develop subsequent metastases, assigning them to groups that are either at low (FDG negative) or high (FDG positive) risk of cancer-associated mortality.

Our objective was to examine the impact of short-term hypothyroidism on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients after rhTSH vs. L-T4 withdrawal. In this multicenter study, the SF-36 Health Survey was administered to 228 patients at three time points: on L-T4, after rhTSH, and after L-T4 withdrawal. INTERVENTIONS included administration of rhTSH on L-T4 and withdrawal from thyroid hormone. Mean SF-36 scores were compared during the two interventions and with the U.S. general population and patients with heart failure, depression, and migraine headache.

Differential expression of novel naturally occurring splice variants of PTEN and their functional consequences in Cowden syndrome and sporadic breast cancer.,Human molecular genetics,Hum. Mol. Genet.,2006-01-25,"PTEN, a dual-phosphatase tumor suppressor, is inactivated in Cowden syndrome (CS), characterized by high risk of breast and thyroid cancer, and in variety of sporadic cancers. Despite the importance of alternative splicing, very limited information on its role in PTEN and associated cancers is available. We identified eight novel PTEN splice variants (SVs) that retained intron 3 regions (3a, 3b, 3c); intron 5 regions (5a, 5b, 5c); excluded part of exon 5 (DelE5) or all of exon 6 (DelE6), respectively. Analysis of SVs in 12 sporadic breast cancers revealed full-length (FL)-PTEN transcript reduction in 10; SVs 3b, 3c and 5c not expressed in 7, 6 and 4, respectively, and under-expressed in the rest. In contrast, SV-5b was over-expressed in breast cancers. PTEN SV analysis in 16 CS/CS-like patients and eight controls revealed that SV-5a is under-expressed and SV-3a over-expressed in the germline of CS/CS-like individuals when compared with controls. Although SV-5a expression decreased P-Akt level and cyclin D1 promoter activity, SVs 5b and 5c increased cyclin D1 promoter activity. Thus, SV-5a behaving like FL-PTEN corroborates our observation that SV-5a is under-expressed in CS when compared with controls. Similarly, SV-5b functionally counters PTEN's action and is over-expressed in sporadic breast cancers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that expression of these SVs is under the regulation of p53.

Clin. Oncol.,2006-03-06,"Vascular endothelial growth factor antisense (VEGF-AS) is an antisense oligonucleotide that targets VEGF, inhibiting angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. This study established the safety, biologic effects, and pharmacokinetics of VEGF-AS in 51 patients with advanced malignancies. VEGF-AS was administered as a 2-hour infusion daily for 5 consecutive days for only one cycle on the first four dose levels, and then administered daily for 5 days every other week for up to 4 months on subsequent levels. Pharmacokinetics, tumor response, and the effect on plasma VEGF levels were determined. The maximum-tolerated dose was 200 mg/m2. Dose-limiting toxicities included grade 4 fever, and pulmonary embolism in one patient each at 250 mg/m2. Mild anemia, fever, fatigue, and gastrointestinal complaints were the most common adverse events. VEGF-AS t(1/2beta) (beta-phase terminal half-life of drug concentration) was 2.25 hours (range, 1.97 to 2.95 hours). Mean plasma VEGF-A (P = .002) and VEGF-C (P = .01) levels decreased 24 hours postinfusion, with a trend towards greater decreases at higher dose levels. At the maximum-tolerated dose, five of six patients demonstrated reductions in plasma VEGF. Clinical responses included complete remission in one patient with AIDS-Kaposi's sarcoma, a mixed but dramatic response in one patient with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and prolongation of progression-free survival compared with that obtained on the immediate prior regimen in six patients (12%) with renal cell, bronchoalveolar, small cell lung, thyroid, and ovarian carcinomas, and chondrosarcoma, respectively.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, in treating patients with progressive metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and to explore the relationship of clinical response to tumor COX-2 expression with immunohistochemistry in a subset of patients. The study was a prospective phase II trial with Fleming single-stage design powered at 80% with a 5% rejection error to detect more than 20% progression-free survival at 12 months. Ambulatory patients were from tertiary referral academic medical centers. Patients in the study had progressive metastatic DTC and had failed prior standard therapy. Patients were treated with celecoxib 400 mg orally twice a day for 12 months. The main outcome measure was progression-free survival at 12 months of treatment using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and/or serum thyroglobulin. Twenty-three of 32 patients experienced progressive disease or stopped therapy due to toxicity, thus fulfilling the intent-to-treat study endpoint for celecoxib failure. One patient achieved partial response, and one patient completed 12 months of therapy progression-free. The patient with partial response was on therapy along with seven other patients when the study was terminated.

Primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the vagina is a rare entity with only 25 previously reported cases in the literature. In previous reports, these tumors have not been distinguished from primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin (Merkel cell carcinoma). The tumor was composed of cells that showed neuroendocrine-type nuclear features with hyperchromasia, nuclear molding, occasional small nucleoli, and a chromatin pattern that was finely granular. The tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin 20 (CK20), neuron specific enolase, pancytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, and chromogranin A expression. Ki-67, a marker of proliferation, was also positive in>90% of cells. The tumor cells showed intense expression of Bcl-2 oncoprotein and mild to moderate expression of c-KIT. Synaptophysin, neurofilament, CD45, CD56, CD10, S-100, HMB-45, cytokeratin 7, and thyroid transcription factor 1 were negative. This pattern of staining is consistent with a Merkel cell carcinoma.

Gene-expression profiling in differentiated thyroid cancer--a viable strategy for the practice of genomic medicine?,"Future oncology (London, England)",Future Oncol,2005-08-01,"Thyroid neoplasias have been largely ignored as an active field of investigation due to the overall favorable prognosis of differentiated nonmedullary thyroid cancers. However, differentiated thyroid cancers have the highest estimated annual percentage increase in incidence amongst all cancer sites. Furthermore, no significant progress has been made to improve survival, especially for advanced disease. Compounding the problem, there remains a lack of highly accurate preoperative markers or molecular-based predictive models to differentiate benign from malignant follicular neoplasias, thus we continue to rely upon surgery for diagnostic purposes in this subset of patients.

Iodine biokinetics and dosimetry in radioiodine therapy of thyroid cancer: procedures and results of a prospective international controlled study of ablation after rhTSH or hormone withdrawal.,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",J. Nucl. Med.,2006-04-01,"Technical aspects and results of the dosimetric assessments of postoperative radioiodine ablation in the framework of an international, prospective, controlled, randomized, comparative study of the effectiveness of ablation therapy with 3.7 GBq (131)I in differentiated thyroid cancer after stimulation with recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) or by thyroid hormone withdrawal (THW) are presented. Sixty-three patients were randomized after thyroidectomy to either the THW or the rhTSH group. Scintigraphic neck images were acquired starting 48 h after radioiodine administration to assess biokinetics in the thyroid remnant. The activity in blood samples was quantified and data from whole-body probe measurements and scintigraphic whole-body scans were combined to deduce retention curves in blood and whole body, respectively. The absorbed dose to the blood was calculated using a modified approach based on the formalism of the MIRD Committee of the Society of Nuclear Medicine. The effective half-time in the remnant thyroid tissue was significantly longer after rhTSH than THW (67.6 +/- 48.8 vs. 48.0 +/- 52.6 h, respectively; P = 0.01), whereas the observed differences of the mean 48-h (131)I uptakes (0.5% +/- 0.7% vs. 0.9% +/- 1.0% after THW; P = 0.1) and residence times (0.9 +/- 1.3 vs. 1.4 +/- 1.5 h after THW; P = 0.1) between the rhTSH and THW groups were not statistically significant. The specific absorbed dose to the blood was significantly (P <0.0001) lower after administration of rhTSH (mean, 0.109 +/- 0.028 mGy/MBq; maximum, 0.18 mGy/MBq) than after THW (mean, 0.167 +/- 0.061 mGy/MBq; maximum, 0.35 mGy/MBq), indicating that higher activities of radioiodine might be safely administered after exogenous stimulation with rhTSH.

Dual epidermal growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibition with NVP-AEE788 for the treatment of aggressive follicular thyroid cancer.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2006-06-01,"Patients with radioiodine-resistant follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) have a poor prognosis, if metastasized, with currently available treatment modalities. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and their receptors (EGFR and VEGFR) have been reported to be overexpressed in FTC and have been implicated in FTC development. We hypothesized that inhibiting the phosphorylation of EGFR and VEGFR by treatment with NVP-AEE788 (AEE788), a novel dual specific EGFR and VEGFR inhibitor, either alone or in combination with paclitaxel, would inhibit the growth of FTC xenografts in an orthotopic nude mouse model. To confirm previous reports, EGF and EGFR expression and vascularity were analyzed in human samples of FTC, Hürthle cell carcinoma, and normal thyroid tissues. EGFR expression in four FTC cell lines was measured using Western blotting. The antitumor effect of AEE788 on FTC cells in vitro was evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays and Western blotting. The effect of AEE788, alone and in combination with paclitaxel, on FTC tumor growth in an orthotopic nude mouse model was also investigated.

A limited set of human MicroRNA is deregulated in follicular thyroid carcinoma.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2006-07-05,"Although the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) and its relation to follicular adenoma (FA) remains unclear, detailed understanding of FTC carcinogenesis would facilitate addressing the scientific and clinical challenges, given that there are morphological and molecular similarities between FTC and the frequently occurring FA. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are a new class of small, noncoding RNAs implicated in development and cancer and may lend novel clues to FTC genesis. For the latter process, a deregulated miRNA can orchestrate the aberrant expression of several hundred target genes. The objective of the study was to identify deregulated miRNAs in FTC. We used two high-density expression arrays to identify miRNAs and their target genes that are differentially expressed between FTC and FA. Validation was done by quantitative RT-PCR. We further functionally characterized the effect of deregulated miRNAs in vitro using HEK293T, FTC133, and K5 cell lines. In total, 45 primary thyroid samples (23 FTC, 20 FA, four normal control thyroid) were analyzed. Two specific miRNAs, miR-197 and miR-346, were significantly overexpressed in FTC. In vitro overexpression of either miRNA induced proliferation, whereas inhibition led to growth arrest. Overexpression of miR-197 and miR-346 repressed the expression of their predicted target genes in vitro and in vivo. Our observations show that miR-197 and miR-346 contribute to FTC carcinogenesis. Both miRNAs and their target genes might potentially provide for novel molecular markers and act as novel targets for treatment by interference, which could potentially normalize the deregulated profile of many downstream target genes.",Journal Article,4948.0,240.0,Although the pathogenesis of follicular carcinoma FTC and its relation to follicular adenoma FA remains unclear detailed understanding of FTC carcinogenesis would facilitate addressing the scientific and clinical challenges given that there are morphological and molecular similarities between FTC and the frequently occurring FA Micro-RNAs miRNAs are a new class of small noncoding RNAs implicated in development and cancer and may lend novel clues to FTC genesis For the latter process a deregulated miRNA can orchestrate the aberrant expression of several hundred target genes The objective of the study was to identify deregulated miRNAs in FTC We used two high-density expression arrays to identify miRNAs and their target genes that are differentially expressed between FTC and FA Validation was done by quantitative RT-PCR We further functionally characterized the effect of deregulated miRNAs in vitro using HEK293T FTC133 and K5 cell lines In total 45 primary samples 23 FTC 20 FA four normal control were analyzed Two specific miRNAs miR-197 and miR-346 were significantly overexpressed in FTC In vitro overexpression of either miRNA induced proliferation whereas inhibition led to growth arrest Overexpression of miR-197 and miR-346 repressed the expression of their predicted target genes in vitro and in vivo Our observations show that miR-197 and miR-346 contribute to FTC carcinogenesis Both miRNAs and their target genes might potentially provide for novel molecular markers and act as novel targets for treatment by interference which could potentially normalize the deregulated profile of many downstream target genes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[242, 3, 1384, 1, 1974, 134, 8527, 2, 211, 2191, 6, 1974, 2434, 4307, 469, 1200, 2455, 612, 1, 8527, 1719, 688, 1876, 3432, 3, 3138, 2, 38, 1427, 447, 17, 125, 32, 4268, 2, 219, 6089, 59, 8527, 2, 3, 746, 1821, 4307, 4659, 4550, 2028, 32, 8, 217, 1040, 1, 302, 6420, 4550, 1771, 4, 193, 2, 12, 2, 68, 12248, 229, 10045, 6, 8527, 9110, 9, 3, 3286, 1129, 8, 5415, 2053, 122, 30969, 3, 1898, 55, 1, 392, 1128, 283, 214, 3, 461, 1, 3, 45, 10, 6, 255, 5415, 2028, 4, 8527, 21, 95, 100, 64, 1263, 55, 3923, 6, 255, 2028, 2, 136, 283, 214, 17, 32, 2478, 570, 59, 8527, 2, 4307, 929, 10, 1822, 20, 1156, 240, 604, 21, 195, 3772, 765, 3, 254, 1, 5415, 2028, 4, 439, 75, 30970, 43783, 2, 37417, 31, 285, 4, 181, 512, 86, 347, 382, 8527, 179, 4307, 294, 295, 182, 11, 311, 100, 112, 2028, 722, 6114, 2, 722, 9184, 11, 97, 1711, 4, 8527, 4, 439, 851, 1, 361, 2053, 277, 457, 547, 297, 836, 6, 129, 1854, 851, 1, 722, 6114, 2, 722, 9184, 6654, 3, 55, 1, 136, 783, 283, 214, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 114, 2172, 514, 17, 722, 6114, 2, 722, 9184, 1248, 6, 8527, 1719, 110, 2028, 2, 136, 283, 214, 822, 751, 377, 9, 229, 219, 525, 2, 2559, 22, 229, 637, 9, 24, 20, 3182, 92, 359, 751, 13633, 3, 5415, 800, 1, 445, 1489, 283, 214]",1635.0,16822819,388
Diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of 18F-FDG PET in Hürthle cell thyroid cancer patients.,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",J. Nucl. Med.,2006-08-01,"Hürthle cell carcinoma is an uncommon and occasionally aggressive differentiated thyroid cancer associated with increased mortality compared with other differentiated thyroid malignancies. Because it generally has lower iodine avidity, 18F-FDG PET has been suggested as a more accurate imaging modality. However, there is limited information with regard to the true diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of 18F-FDG PET in this disease. All patients with Hürthle cell thyroid cancer who underwent their first 18F-FDG PET scan between May 1996 and February 2003 were identified retrospectively. 18F-FDG PET scans were reviewed and compared with all available imaging studies, including CT, ultrasound, and radioiodine scintigraphy (RIS). Abnormal 18F-FDG uptake was assessed visually and by measuring the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the most intense lesion. Clinical follow-up for at least 1 y or until death was required for inclusion. Forty-four patients met inclusion criteria. The median follow-up was 2.9 y. There were 24 positive and 20 negative 18F-FDG PET scans with 1 false-positive and 1 false-negative study, resulting in a diagnostic sensitivity of 95.8% and a specificity of 95%. In 5 of 11 patients who had both positive CT and 18F-FDG PET findings, 18F-FDG PET revealed additional sites of disease. Furthermore, 18F-FDG PET correctly classified as negative 3 patients with false-positive CT findings. In 3 of 6 patients with positive RIS, 18F-FDG PET revealed additional sites of metastatic disease. Ten patients with positive 18F-FDG PET had negative RIS. Only 1 patient with negative 18F-FDG PET had positive RIS. The SUVmax also provided prognostic information: In a stepwise fashion, each increase in intensity by SUVmax unit was associated with a 6% increase in mortality (P < 0.001). The 5-y overall survival in patients with SUVmax < 10 was 92%; it declined to 64% in those with SUVmax > 10 (P < 0.01). 18F-FDG PET has excellent diagnostic accuracy in Hürthle cell thyroid cancer patients, improving on CT and RIS. Intense 18F-FDG uptake in lesions is an indicator of a poor prognosis. Our data suggest that all patients with Hürthle cell thyroid cancer should undergo 18F-FDG PET as part of their initial postoperative staging and periodically to screen for occult recurrence, particularly in patients with elevated serum thyroglobulin.",Clinical Trial,4921.0,85.0,Hürthle cell carcinoma is an uncommon and occasionally aggressive differentiated cancer associated with increased mortality compared with other differentiated malignancies Because it generally has lower iodine avidity 18F-FDG PET has been suggested as a more accurate imaging modality However there is limited information with regard to the true diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of 18F-FDG PET in this disease All patients with Hürthle cell cancer who underwent their first 18F-FDG PET scan between May 1996 and February 2003 were identified retrospectively 18F-FDG PET scans were reviewed and compared with all available imaging studies including CT ultrasound and radioiodine scintigraphy RIS Abnormal 18F-FDG uptake was assessed visually and by measuring the maximum standardized uptake value SUVmax of the most intense lesion Clinical follow-up for at least 1 y or until death was required for inclusion Forty-four patients met inclusion criteria The median follow-up was 2.9 y There were 24 positive and 20 negative 18F-FDG PET scans with 1 false-positive and 1 false-negative study resulting in a diagnostic sensitivity of 95.8 and a specificity of 95 In 5 of 11 patients who had both positive CT and 18F-FDG PET findings 18F-FDG PET revealed additional sites of disease Furthermore 18F-FDG PET correctly classified as negative 3 patients with false-positive CT findings In 3 of 6 patients with positive RIS 18F-FDG PET revealed additional sites of metastatic disease Ten patients with positive 18F-FDG PET had negative RIS Only 1 patient with negative 18F-FDG PET had positive RIS The SUVmax also provided prognostic information In a stepwise fashion each increase in intensity by SUVmax unit was associated with a 6 increase in mortality P 0.001 The 5-y overall survival in patients with SUVmax 10 was 92 it declined to 64 in those with SUVmax 10 P 0.01 18F-FDG PET has excellent diagnostic accuracy in Hürthle cell cancer patients improving on CT and RIS Intense 18F-FDG uptake in lesions is an indicator of a poor prognosis Our data suggest that all patients with Hürthle cell cancer should undergo 18F-FDG PET as part of their initial postoperative staging and periodically to screen for occult recurrence particularly in patients with elevated serum thyroglobulin,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[13545, 31, 134, 16, 35, 2052, 2, 6319, 571, 1442, 12, 41, 5, 101, 282, 72, 5, 127, 1442, 441, 408, 192, 1228, 71, 280, 4287, 6071, 4751, 1285, 495, 71, 85, 1148, 22, 8, 80, 1481, 270, 1396, 137, 125, 16, 383, 487, 5, 2539, 6, 3, 2501, 752, 1190, 2, 177, 549, 1, 4751, 1285, 495, 4, 26, 34, 62, 7, 5, 13545, 31, 12, 54, 208, 136, 157, 4751, 1285, 495, 1657, 59, 68, 2648, 2, 3010, 1522, 11, 108, 894, 4751, 1285, 495, 1441, 11, 446, 2, 72, 5, 62, 390, 270, 94, 141, 425, 1945, 2, 7211, 7577, 9284, 1668, 4751, 1285, 1135, 10, 275, 11014, 2, 20, 2978, 3, 689, 1670, 1135, 549, 4996, 1, 3, 96, 3933, 1180, 38, 166, 126, 9, 28, 506, 14, 2055, 15, 1100, 273, 10, 616, 9, 1680, 1213, 294, 7, 543, 1680, 371, 3, 52, 166, 126, 10, 18, 83, 2055, 125, 11, 259, 109, 2, 179, 199, 4751, 1285, 495, 1441, 5, 14, 2133, 109, 2, 14, 2133, 199, 45, 1113, 4, 8, 752, 485, 1, 48, 66, 2, 8, 1121, 1, 48, 4, 33, 1, 175, 7, 54, 42, 110, 109, 425, 2, 4751, 1285, 495, 272, 4751, 1285, 495, 553, 402, 633, 1, 34, 798, 4751, 1285, 495, 4911, 1373, 22, 199, 27, 7, 5, 2133, 109, 425, 272, 4, 27, 1, 49, 7, 5, 109, 9284, 4751, 1285, 495, 553, 402, 633, 1, 113, 34, 1618, 7, 5, 109, 4751, 1285, 495, 42, 199, 9284, 158, 14, 69, 5, 199, 4751, 1285, 495, 42, 109, 9284, 3, 4996, 120, 1052, 177, 487, 4, 8, 5497, 3240, 296, 344, 4, 837, 20, 4996, 2712, 10, 41, 5, 8, 49, 344, 4, 282, 19, 13, 144, 3, 33, 2055, 63, 25, 4, 7, 5, 4996, 79, 10, 937, 192, 3054, 6, 660, 4, 135, 5, 4996, 79, 19, 13, 355, 4751, 1285, 495, 71, 1503, 752, 1190, 4, 13545, 31, 12, 7, 1673, 23, 425, 2, 9284, 3933, 4751, 1285, 1135, 4, 406, 16, 35, 3287, 1, 8, 334, 356, 114, 74, 309, 17, 62, 7, 5, 13545, 31, 12, 257, 1251, 4751, 1285, 495, 22, 760, 1, 136, 388, 573, 632, 2, 15309, 6, 2413, 9, 2879, 146, 823, 4, 7, 5, 804, 524, 8978]",2283.0,16883003,63
A phase I trial of intermittent high-dose gefitinib and fixed-dose docetaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors.,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol.,2006-08-01,"Based on our mouse xenograft model demonstrating that intermittent high-dose gefitinib sensitizes tumors to subsequent treatment with taxanes, we initiated this phase I trial to explore docetaxel in combination with escalating doses of intermittent gefitinib (Iressa) given prior to docetaxel. This was a phase I study where patients with advanced cancer were treated with escalating doses of gefitinib (1,000, 1,500, 2,250, 3,000 mg) on days 1 and 2 followed by docetaxel (75 mg/m2) on day 3 of a 21 day cycle. Gefitinib pharmacokinetic data were obtained on days 1, 2, and 3 of cycles 1 and 2 at each dose level. 18 patients were enrolled in this study with the most frequent tumor types being non-small cell lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell cancer. The dose-limiting toxicity was neutropenia (n=1 at dose level 2, n=2 at dose level 4). Rash, diarrhea, and fatigue were the most common grade 1-2 toxicities.

Growth-inhibitory effects of human anti-insulin-like growth factor-I receptor antibody (A12) in an orthotopic nude mouse model of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2006-08-01,"The insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and its ligands have been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of various cancers, including those arising in the thyroid gland. We therefore evaluated whether the IGF-IR could serve as a potential target for therapy of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC). The expression and activation of the IGF-IR and some of its downstream signaling pathway components were evaluated in both human thyroid cancer specimens and thyroid cancer cell lines. The therapeutic potential of a humanized monoclonal antibody (A12) directed against IGF-IR was assessed in vitro and in vivo in an orthotopic model of ATC. Tumor volume and overall survival time were analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of A12 in vivo. IGF-IR was overexpressed in 94% of the thyroid cancers. Blockade of IGF-IR with A12 was effective in attenuating IGF-IR signaling both in vitro and in vivo. However, the inhibitory effects of A12 on cell proliferation were cell line dependent, as those ATC cell lines that had detectable levels of pIGF-IR were more sensitive to A12 treatment. A12 was equally effective in vivo, where it brought approximately 57% (P = 0.041) inhibition in tumor volume. The concomitant use of A12 and irinotecan produced additive effects and resulted in a 93% (P < 0.001) reduction in tumor volume. Blocking IGF-IR blocked Akt phosphorylation and decreased proliferation and microvessel density but increased apoptosis within the tumor xenografts. Our results also highlighted a previously undefined IGF-IR-mediated antiangiogenic effect on tumor-associated endothelium in thyroid cancers.

The so-called stunning of thyroid tissue.,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",J. Nucl. Med.,2006-09-01,"When thyroid tissues exhibited concentrations of therapeutic (131)I that appeared to be less than that predicted by data from the preceding diagnostic (131)I, the phenomenon was called stunning. We hypothesized that stunning arose from the early effects of the therapeutic dose of (131)I and that the initial uptake of (131)I, observed within the first day, was not impaired by the diagnostic dose. The hypothesis was tested by 2 types of studies. In each type, the fractional concentrations of (131)I in residual neck thyroid tissues of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma were quantified. In the first study, fractional concentrations of diagnostic and therapeutic (131)I were measured at 2 d, a time when stunning has been observed, and expressed as ratios of radioactivity: therapeutic/diagnostic (Rx/Dx). Three different doses of diagnostic (131)I were prescribed to assess a dose response. In the second study, patients were prospectively recruited and tested to record disappearances of radioactivity from thyroid tissues. Diagnostic doses were 1.0 mCi (37 MBq) in all; therapeutic doses were 150 and 30 mCi (5,550 and 1,110 MBq), each to half of the patients. The disappearance curves were extrapolated to the period between 0 and 1 d, an interval when maximum uptake of ingested (131)I would be expected. The fractional concentrations of (131)I at 2 d and at 0-1 d were compared in terms of Rx/Dx ratios to assess changes at each time point. In the first study, after diagnostic doses of 2, 1, and 0.5 mCi (74, 37, and 18.5 MBq), mean 2-d Rx/Dx values in 24, 29, and 17 patients were 0.35, 0.50, and 0.46 (P = 0.087). Of all patients, 74% exhibited Rx/Dx <0.6. In the second study, 6 of 10 patients exhibited disappearance curves of (131)I in which Rx/Dx was <0.6 at 2 d; 5 of the 6 had Rx/Dx values >0.97 at the 0- to 1-d point. In 1 patient the Rx/Dx was 0.54 at 2 d and 0.66 at the earlier time point. The other 4 patients had disappearance curves in which Rx/Dx values were >1.0 throughout or were above 0.6 and did not greatly change. Two days after the administration of (131)I, the mean fractional concentration of radioactivity in thyroid tissues after a therapeutic dose is <60% of the diagnostic dose in most patients, but no correlation of Rx/Dx with the mCi in the diagnostic dose was seen. In 5 of 6 patients in whom the Rx/Dx at 2 d was <0.6, the maximum fractional concentrations of therapeutic and diagnostic (131)I (i.e., the tissue uptakes during the first day) were similar; this pattern was most apparent after therapies with 150 mCi.

Thyroid cancer in childhood cancer survivors: a detailed evaluation of radiation dose response and its modifiers.,Radiation research,Radiat. Res.,2006-10-01,"Radiation exposure at a young age is a strong risk factor for thyroid cancer. We conducted a nested case-control study of 69 thyroid cancer cases and 265 controls from a cohort of 14,054 childhood cancer survivors to evaluate the shape of the radiation dose-response relationship, in particular at high doses, and to assess modification of the radiation effects by patient and treatment characteristics. We considered several types of statistical models to estimate the excess relative risk (ERR), mainly guided by radiobiological models. A two-parameter model with a term linear in dose and a negative exponential in dose squared provided the best parsimonious description with an ERR of 1.3 per gray (95% confidence interval 0.4-4.1) at doses below 6 Gy and a relative decrease in ERR of 0.2% per unit dose squared with increasing dose, that is, decreases in the ERR/Gy of 53% at 20 Gy and 95% at 40 Gy. Further analyses using spline models suggested that the significant nonlinearity at high doses was characterized most appropriately as a true downturn rather than a flattening of the dose-response curve. We found no statistically significant modification of the dose-response relationship by patient characteristics; however, the linear parameter (i.e., the ERR/ Gy at doses less than 6 Gy) did decrease consistently and linearly with increasing age at childhood cancer diagnosis, from 4.45 for 0-1-year-olds to 0.48 for 15-20-year-olds.

Hypothyroidism: a possible risk factor for liver cancer in patients with no known underlying cause of liver disease.,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,Clin. Gastroenterol. Hepatol.,2006-09-26,"Up to 25% of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) seen in U.S. centers are of unknown etiology. Animal studies suggest that hypothyroidism can directly cause liver cell damage and might be a risk factor for HCC. We conducted a case-control study to evaluate the relationship between hypothyroidism and HCC. Cases (n = 54) were HCC patients seen at Mayo Clinic Rochester in whom no underlying etiology for chronic liver disease could be determined. Two groups of controls were selected, HCC patients with HCV (n = 57) and HCC patients with alcoholic liver disease (n = 49). Hypothyroidism was defined as thyroid-stimulating hormone level >5.0, history of hypothyroidism before HCC diagnosis, or a history of being on thyroid replacement at the time of HCC diagnosis. We used multivariate logistic regression to model the relationship between hypothyroidism and HCC etiology. Of the 160 patients, 18 (11%) had a history of hypothyroidism. Twelve (22%) of those with no known etiology for HCC, 2 (4%) of those with HCV, and 4 (8%) of those with alcoholic liver disease had hypothyroidism. Patients with HCC of unknown etiology were significantly more likely to have a history of hypothyroidism as compared with HCC patients with HCV (adjusted odds ratio, 12.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-117.1) and as compared with all controls (adjusted odds ratio, 6.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-42.1).

Empiric radioactive iodine dosing regimens frequently exceed maximum tolerated activity levels in elderly patients with thyroid cancer.,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",J. Nucl. Med.,2006-10-01,"Although 131I-iodine (RAI) therapy is a mainstay in the treatment of metastatic thyroid cancer, there is controversy regarding the maximum activity that can safely be administered without dosimetric determination of the maximum tolerable activity (MTA). At most institutions, a fixed empiric dosing strategy is often used, with administered activities ranging from 5.55 to 9.25 GBq (150-250 mCi). In our experience with dosimetry, we have observed that this empiric dosing strategy often results in administered RAI activities exceeding the MTA safety limit of 200 cGy (rads) to the blood or bone marrow in many patients with metastatic thyroid cancer. We retrospectively analyzed 535 hypothyroid dosimetry studies performed as part of routine clinical care in 328 patients with apparently normal renal function. The MTA was less than 5.18 GBq (140 mCi) in 3%, less than 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) in 8%, and less than 9.25 GBq (250 mCi) in 19%. Analysis of MTA values by age at the time of dosimetry revealed little change in the MTA until the age of 70 y, when a significant decrease occurred. An empiric administered activity of 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) would exceed the MTA in 8%-15% of patients less than 70 y old and 22%-38% of patients 70 y old or older. However, administration of 9.25 GBq (250 mCi) would exceed the MTA in 22% of patients less than 70 y old and 50% of patients 70 y old or older. Factors associated with a lowering of MTA to less than 9.25 GBq (250 mCi) were age at dosimetry greater than 45 y, the female sex, subtotal thyroidectomy, and RAI-avid diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases. Administered RAI activities of less than 5.18 GBq (140 mCi) rarely exposed blood to more than 200 cGy except in the very elderly. However, administered activities of 7.4-9.25 GBq (200-250 mCi) frequently exceeded the calculated MTA in patients 70 y old or older. Therefore, dosimetry-guided RAI therapy may be preferable to fixed-dose RAI treatment strategies in older patients with thyroid cancer and in patients with RAI-avid diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases, even when renal function is normal.",Journal Article,4860.0,133.0,Although 131I-iodine RAI therapy is a mainstay in the treatment of metastatic cancer there is controversy regarding the maximum activity that can safely be administered without dosimetric determination of the maximum tolerable activity MTA At most institutions a fixed empiric dosing strategy is often used with administered activities ranging from 5.55 to 9.25 GBq 150-250 mCi In our experience with dosimetry we have observed that this empiric dosing strategy often results in administered RAI activities exceeding the MTA safety limit of 200 cGy rads to the blood or marrow in many patients with metastatic cancer We retrospectively analyzed 535 hypothyroid dosimetry studies performed as part of routine clinical care in 328 patients with apparently normal function The MTA was less than 5.18 GBq 140 mCi in 3 less than 7.4 GBq 200 mCi in 8 and less than 9.25 GBq 250 mCi in 19 Analysis of MTA values by age at the time of dosimetry revealed little change in the MTA until the age of 70 y when a significant decrease occurred An empiric administered activity of 7.4 GBq 200 mCi would exceed the MTA in 8 -15 of patients less than 70 y old and 22 -38 of patients 70 y old or older However administration of 9.25 GBq 250 mCi would exceed the MTA in 22 of patients less than 70 y old and 50 of patients 70 y old or older Factors associated with a lowering of MTA to less than 9.25 GBq 250 mCi were age at dosimetry greater than 45 y the female sex subtotal thyroidectomy and RAI-avid diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases Administered RAI activities of less than 5.18 GBq 140 mCi rarely exposed blood to more than 200 cGy except in the very elderly However administered activities of 7.4-9.25 GBq 200-250 mCi frequently exceeded the calculated MTA in patients 70 y old or older Therefore dosimetry-guided RAI therapy may be preferable to fixed-dose RAI treatment strategies in older patients with cancer and in patients with RAI-avid diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases even when function is normal,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[242, 12982, 4287, 4121, 36, 16, 8, 4041, 4, 3, 24, 1, 113, 12, 125, 16, 4089, 666, 3, 689, 128, 17, 122, 2268, 40, 468, 187, 3187, 3104, 1, 3, 689, 2668, 128, 14955, 28, 96, 1764, 8, 1959, 7866, 1280, 692, 16, 629, 95, 5, 468, 2042, 2223, 29, 33, 614, 6, 83, 243, 12090, 1577, 2039, 4076, 4, 114, 730, 5, 4113, 21, 47, 164, 17, 26, 7866, 1280, 692, 629, 99, 4, 468, 4121, 2042, 5178, 3, 14955, 367, 2385, 1, 1250, 3071, 6143, 6, 3, 315, 15, 581, 4, 445, 7, 5, 113, 12, 21, 894, 311, 10528, 18875, 4113, 94, 173, 22, 760, 1, 1311, 38, 165, 4, 8584, 7, 5, 6343, 295, 343, 3, 14955, 10, 299, 76, 33, 203, 12090, 3304, 4076, 4, 27, 299, 76, 67, 39, 12090, 1250, 4076, 4, 66, 2, 299, 76, 83, 243, 12090, 2039, 4076, 4, 326, 65, 1, 14955, 1030, 20, 89, 28, 3, 98, 1, 4113, 553, 1215, 707, 4, 3, 14955, 1100, 3, 89, 1, 431, 2055, 198, 8, 93, 775, 489, 35, 7866, 468, 128, 1, 67, 39, 12090, 1250, 4076, 688, 6818, 3, 14955, 4, 66, 167, 1, 7, 299, 76, 431, 2055, 1095, 2, 350, 519, 1, 7, 431, 2055, 1095, 15, 434, 137, 634, 1, 83, 243, 12090, 2039, 4076, 688, 6818, 3, 14955, 4, 350, 1, 7, 299, 76, 431, 2055, 1095, 2, 212, 1, 7, 431, 2055, 1095, 15, 434, 130, 41, 5, 8, 8326, 1, 14955, 6, 299, 76, 83, 243, 12090, 2039, 4076, 11, 89, 28, 4113, 378, 76, 512, 2055, 3, 1061, 1035, 5503, 5949, 2, 4121, 5189, 1388, 1607, 1087, 196, 468, 4121, 2042, 1, 299, 76, 33, 203, 12090, 3304, 4076, 2416, 2234, 315, 6, 80, 76, 1250, 3071, 2187, 4, 3, 923, 1216, 137, 468, 2042, 1, 67, 39, 83, 243, 12090, 1250, 2039, 4076, 746, 4726, 3, 981, 14955, 4, 7, 431, 2055, 1095, 15, 434, 673, 4113, 1808, 4121, 36, 68, 40, 7474, 6, 1959, 61, 4121, 24, 422, 4, 434, 7, 5, 12, 2, 4, 7, 5, 4121, 5189, 1388, 1607, 1087, 196, 871, 198, 343, 16, 295]",2003.0,17015892,351

The objective of this study was to develop a radioiodination procedure primarily to assess PET imaging with 124I. A new peptide, DOTA-D-Tyr-D-Lys(HSG)-D-Glu-D-Lys(HSG)-NH2 (DOTA is 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid), was synthesized and conditions were established for radioiodination with yields of approximately 70% for 131I and 60% for 124I. Pretargeting with the 131I- and 124I-labeled peptide was tested in nude mice bearing LS174T human colonic tumors that were first given the anti-CEA x anti-HSG bs-mAb. Imaging (including small-animal PET) and necropsy data were collected at several intervals over 24 h. Comparisons were made between animals given 124I-anti-CEA Fab', 18F-FDG, the same peptide radiolabeled with 111In and pretargeted with the bs-mAb, and the radioiodinated peptide alone. The radioiodinated peptide alone cleared quickly from the blood with no evidence of tumor targeting, but when pretargeted with the bs-mAb, tumor uptake increased 70-fold, with efficient and rapid clearance from normal tissues, allowing clear visualization of tumor within 1-2 h. Tumor uptake measured at necropsy was 3- to 15-fold higher and tumor-to-blood ratios were 10- to 20-fold higher than those for 124I-Fab' at 1 and 24 h, respectively. Thyroid and stomach uptake was observed with the radioiodinated peptide several hours after injection (animals were not premedicated to reduce uptake in these tissues), but gastric uptake was much more pronounced with 124I-Fab'. Tumor visualization with 18F-FDG at approximately 1.5 h was also good but showed substantially more uptake in several normal tissues, making image interpretation in the pretargeted animals less ambiguous than with 18F-FDG.

Seven hundred thirty-eight patients with nodular thyroid disease evaluated between 1990 and 2004. Patients with an FNAB specimen suspicious for PTC were identified. The frequency of carcinoma was determined. Clinical features were reviewed. The FNAB specimens suspicious for PTC were examined in a blinded fashion to determine if specific cytologic features were important in distinguishing benign vs malignant disease. The presence of specific clinical and cytologic features was correlated with the incidence of carcinoma. A secondary outcome measure was to determine the value of frozen section examination in establishing the extent of thyroidectomy. Forty-five patients (7%) had an FNAB specimen suspicious for PTC; 18 (40%) of these patients had carcinoma. Prominent nuclear inclusions and/or grooves, papillary formations, and the absence of colloid were features associated with PTC (P<.05). No clinical features reliably identified malignant disease.

Med.,2006-11-01,"Sunitinib malate is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor recently approved for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors and renal cell carcinoma. Because the ret proto-oncogene is also inhibited by this agent, clinical evaluation of thyroid function was performed. To describe the prevalence and clinical presentation of thyroid dysfunction related to sunitinib therapy. Prospective, observational cohort study. Tertiary care hospital. 42 patients treated for a median of 37 weeks (range, 10 to 167 weeks). Following analysis of serial thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurements collected prospectively during a clinical trial of sunitinib, the authors determined the proportion of patients with thyroid dysfunction. Abnormal serum TSH concentrations were documented in 26 of 42 patients (62%): 15 (36%) developed persistent, primary hypothyroidism; 4 (10%) developed isolated TSH suppression; and 7 (17%) experienced transient, mild TSH elevations. The risk for hypothyroidism increased with the duration of sunitinib therapy. Six of 15 (40%) hypothyroid patients had suppressed TSH concentrations before developing hypothyroidism, suggesting thyroiditis. Two hypothyroid patients evaluated with thyroid ultrasonography had no visualized thyroid tissue despite normal baseline thyroid function. The exploratory nature of this study precluded more frequent biochemical and sonographic analysis that may better define the mechanism of sunitinib-associated thyroid dysfunction. Hypothyroidism is a frequent complication of sunitinib therapy. Regular surveillance of thyroid function is warranted in patients receiving the drug. Although the mechanism by which this complication occurs is unknown, the observations of preceding TSH suppression and subsequent absence of visualized thyroid tissue in some patients suggest that sunitinib may induce a destructive thyroiditis through follicular cell apoptosis.

Expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 in neoplastic glial cells is associated with integrin beta1-dependent adhesion to the extracellular matrix.,Molecular cancer research : MCR,Mol. Cancer Res.,2006-12-01,"The abnormal function of tyrosine kinase receptors is a hallmark of malignant gliomas. Tie2 receptor tyrosine kinase is a specific endothelial cell receptor whose function is positively regulated by angiopoietin 1 (Ang1). Recently, Tie2 has also been found in the nonvascular compartment of several tumors, including leukemia as well as breast, gastric, and thyroid cancers. There is, however, little information on the function of the Ang1/Tie2 pathway in the non-stromal cells within human tumors. We found that surgical glioblastoma specimens contained a subpopulation of Tie2+/CD31- and Tie2+/GFAP+ cells, suggesting that Tie2 is indeed expressed outside the vascular compartment of gliomas. Furthermore, analysis of a tissue array consisting of 116 human glioma samples showed that Tie2 expression in the neoplastic glial cells was significantly associated with progression from a lower to higher grade. Importantly, Ang1 stimulation of Tie2+ glioma cells resulted in increased adherence of the cells to collagen I and IV, suggesting that Tie2 regulates glioma cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Conversely, the down-regulation of Tie2 levels by small interference RNA or the addition of soluble Tie2 abrogated the Ang1-mediated effect on cell adhesion. In studying the expression of cell adhesion molecules, we found that Tie2 activation was related to the up-regulation of integrin beta1 levels and the formation of focal adhesions. These results, together with the reported fact that malignant gliomas express high levels of Ang1, suggest the existence of an autocrine loop in malignant gliomas and that a Tie2-dependent pathway modulates cell-to-extracellular matrix adhesion, providing new insights into the highly infiltrative phenotype of human gliomas.",Journal Article,4799.0,44.0,The abnormal function of tyrosine kinase receptors is a hallmark of malignant gliomas Tie2 receptor tyrosine kinase is a specific endothelial cell receptor whose function is positively regulated by angiopoietin 1 Ang1 Recently Tie2 has also been found in the nonvascular compartment of several tumors including as well as and cancers There is however little information on the function of the Ang1/Tie2 pathway in the non-stromal cells within human tumors We found that surgical glioblastoma specimens contained a subpopulation of Tie2+/CD31- and Tie2+/GFAP+ cells suggesting that Tie2 is indeed expressed outside the vascular compartment of gliomas Furthermore analysis of a tissue array consisting of 116 human glioma samples showed that Tie2 expression in the neoplastic glial cells was significantly associated with progression from a lower to higher grade Importantly Ang1 stimulation of Tie2+ glioma cells resulted in increased adherence of the cells to collagen I and IV suggesting that Tie2 regulates glioma cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix Conversely the down-regulation of Tie2 levels by small interference RNA or the addition of soluble Tie2 abrogated the Ang1-mediated effect on cell adhesion In studying the expression of cell adhesion molecules we found that Tie2 activation was related to the up-regulation of integrin beta1 levels and the formation of focal adhesions These results together with the reported fact that malignant gliomas express high levels of Ang1 suggest the existence of an autocrine loop in malignant gliomas and that a Tie2-dependent pathway modulates cell-to-extracellular matrix adhesion providing new insights into the highly infiltrative phenotype of human gliomas,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[3, 1668, 343, 1, 564, 216, 1186, 16, 8, 4683, 1, 393, 1287, 8813, 153, 564, 216, 16, 8, 112, 845, 31, 153, 1310, 343, 16, 2375, 1065, 20, 7898, 14, 19054, 761, 8813, 71, 120, 85, 204, 4, 3, 38326, 3616, 1, 392, 57, 141, 22, 149, 22, 2, 163, 125, 16, 137, 1215, 487, 23, 3, 343, 1, 3, 19054, 8813, 308, 4, 3, 220, 1126, 37, 262, 171, 57, 21, 204, 17, 221, 996, 623, 3070, 8, 5518, 1, 8813, 6019, 2, 8813, 13154, 37, 802, 17, 8813, 16, 4462, 570, 2513, 3, 756, 3616, 1, 1287, 798, 65, 1, 8, 246, 1926, 2273, 1, 3790, 171, 945, 347, 224, 17, 8813, 55, 4, 3, 2000, 6944, 37, 10, 97, 41, 5, 91, 29, 8, 280, 6, 142, 88, 1859, 19054, 2503, 1, 8813, 945, 37, 627, 4, 101, 2149, 1, 3, 37, 6, 3945, 70, 2, 478, 802, 17, 8813, 2468, 945, 31, 2128, 6, 3, 1976, 2248, 3154, 3, 1328, 863, 1, 8813, 148, 20, 302, 3182, 893, 15, 3, 352, 1, 2968, 8813, 3728, 3, 19054, 517, 254, 23, 31, 2128, 4, 4559, 3, 55, 1, 31, 2128, 1598, 21, 204, 17, 8813, 363, 10, 139, 6, 3, 126, 863, 1, 2876, 5864, 148, 2, 3, 1264, 1, 2137, 13233, 46, 99, 1162, 5, 3, 210, 1991, 17, 393, 1287, 1669, 64, 148, 1, 19054, 309, 3, 5335, 1, 35, 5297, 4432, 4, 393, 1287, 2, 17, 8, 8813, 470, 308, 5259, 31, 6, 1976, 2248, 2128, 1736, 217, 1957, 237, 3, 561, 6010, 1005, 1, 171, 1287]",1714.0,17189382,152
Outcomes of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma following initial therapy.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2006-12-01,"This analysis was performed to determine the effect of initial therapy on the outcomes of thyroid cancer patients. The study setting was a prospectively followed multi-institutional registry. Patients were stratified as low risk (stages I and II) or high risk (stages III and IV). Treatments employed included near-total thyroidectomy, administration of radioactive iodine, and thyroid hormone suppression therapy. Outcome measures were overall survival, disease-specific survival, and disease-free survival. Near-total thyroidectomy, radioactive iodine, and aggressive thyroid hormone suppression therapy were each independently associated with longer overall survival in high-risk patients. Near-total thyroidectomy followed by radioactive iodine therapy, and moderate thyroid hormone suppression therapy, both predicted improved overall survival in stage II patients. No treatment modality, including lack of radioactive iodine, was associated with altered survival in stage I patients. Based on our overall survival data, we confirm that near-total thyroidectomy is indicated in high-risk patients. We also conclude that radioactive iodine therapy is beneficial for stage II, III, and IV patients. Importantly, we show for the first time that superior outcomes are associated with aggressive thyroid hormone suppression therapy in high-risk patients, but are achieved with modest suppression in stage II patients.

Prediction of absorbed dose to normal organs in thyroid cancer patients treated with 131I by use of 124I PET and 3-dimensional internal dosimetry software.,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",J. Nucl. Med.,2007-01-01,"The objective of this work was to determine normal organ (131)I dosimetry in patients undergoing radioiodide therapy for thyroid cancer by use of serial scanning with (124)I PET. A total of 26 patients who had papillary and follicular metastatic thyroid cancer and who were already enrolled in a Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (131)I thyroid cancer protocol were selected for this study. Imaging before (131)I therapy consisted of multiple, whole-body (124)I PET studies over a period of 2-8 d, an (18)F-FDG PET scan and, for some, a diagnostic CT scan. With a set of in-house-developed software tools (3-dimensional internal dosimetry [3D-ID] and Multiple Image Analysis Utility [MIAU]), the following procedures were performed: all PET emission and transmission and CT image sets were aligned; half-life-corrected tomographic images of (131)I activity were integrated voxel by voxel to produce cumulated (131)I activity images; and the latter images were, in turn, convolved with a (131)I electron-photon point kernel to produce images of (131)I dose distribution. Cumulated activity values and calculated residence times obtained from our patient-specific dosimetry software (3D-ID) were used as inputs to OLINDA, and volume difference-adjusted comparisons were made between the mean dose estimates. With 3D-ID, dose volume histograms and mean doses were calculated for 14 organs, and results were expressed in Gy/GBq. The highest mean dose, 0.26 Gy/GBq, was seen in the right submandibular gland, whereas the lowest mean dose, 0.029 Gy/GBq, was seen in the brain.

The role of prophylactic surgery in cancer prevention.,World journal of surgery,World J Surg,2007-03-01,"Since the human genome has been sequenced many mysteries of cell biology have been unravelled, thereby clarifying the pathogenesis of several diseases, particularly cancer. In members of kindreds with certain hereditary diseases, it is now possible early in life to predict with great certainty whether or not a family member has inherited the mutated allele causing the disease. In hereditary malignancies this has been particularly important, because in affected family members there is the possibility of removing the organ destined to develop cancer before malignancy develops or while it is in situ. At first consideration, it would appear that ""prophylactic surgery"" would have a place in many hereditary malignancies; however, the procedure has applicability only if certain criteria are met: (1) the genetic mutation causing the hereditary malignancy must have a very high penetrance and be expressed regardless of environmental factors; (2) there must be a highly reliable test to identify patients who have inherited the mutated gene; (3) the organ must be removed with minimal morbidity and virtually no mortality; (4) there must be a suitable replacement for the function of the removed organ; and (5) there must be a reliable method of determining over time that the patient has been cured by ""prophylactic surgery."" In this monograph we review several hereditary malignancies and consider those where prophylactic surgery might be useful. As we learn, there are various barriers to performing the procedure in many common hereditary cancer syndromes. The archetype disease syndromes, which meet each of the five criteria mentioned above and where prophylactic surgery is most useful, are the type 2 multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes: MEN2A, MEN2B, and the related familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. An additional benefit of the Human Genome Project, has been the development of pharmacologic and biologic compounds that block the metabolic pathway(s) activated by specific genetic mutations. Many of these compounds have shown efficacy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancers, and there is the likelihood that they will prove beneficial in preventing the outgrowth of malignant cells in patients destined to develop a hereditary cancer.",Journal Article,4709.0,31.0,Since the human genome has been sequenced many mysteries of cell biology have been unravelled thereby clarifying the pathogenesis of several diseases particularly cancer In members of kindreds with certain hereditary diseases it is now possible early in life to predict with great certainty whether or not a family member has inherited the mutated allele causing the disease In hereditary malignancies this has been particularly important because in affected family members there is the possibility of removing the organ destined to develop cancer before malignancy develops or while it is in situ At first consideration it would appear that `` prophylactic surgery '' would have a place in many hereditary malignancies however the procedure has applicability only if certain criteria are met 1 the genetic mutation causing the hereditary malignancy must have a very high penetrance and be expressed regardless of environmental factors 2 there must be a highly reliable test to identify patients who have inherited the mutated gene 3 the organ must be removed with minimal morbidity and virtually no mortality 4 there must be a suitable replacement for the function of the removed organ and 5 there must be a reliable method of determining over time that the patient has been cured by `` prophylactic surgery '' In this monograph we review several hereditary malignancies and consider those where prophylactic surgery might be useful As we learn there are various barriers to performing the procedure in many common hereditary cancer syndromes The archetype disease syndromes which meet each of the five criteria mentioned above and where prophylactic surgery is most useful are the type 2 multiple endocrine neoplasia MEN syndromes MEN2A MEN2B and the related familial medullary carcinoma An additional benefit of the Human Genome Project has been the development of pharmacologic and biologic compounds that block the metabolic pathway s activated by specific genetic mutations Many of these compounds have shown efficacy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancers and there is the likelihood that they will prove beneficial in preventing the outgrowth of malignant cells in patients destined to develop a hereditary cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[1192, 3, 171, 898, 71, 85, 4040, 445, 26458, 1, 31, 891, 47, 85, 44627, 2267, 14622, 3, 1384, 1, 392, 1342, 823, 12, 4, 1684, 1, 10141, 5, 1840, 2305, 1342, 192, 16, 1134, 899, 191, 4, 358, 6, 678, 5, 2797, 12334, 317, 15, 44, 8, 607, 2693, 71, 2986, 3, 1185, 1254, 3440, 3, 34, 4, 2305, 441, 26, 71, 85, 823, 305, 408, 4, 1424, 607, 1684, 125, 16, 3, 2526, 1, 9026, 3, 1259, 19539, 6, 690, 12, 348, 710, 4734, 15, 369, 192, 16, 4, 957, 28, 157, 2415, 192, 688, 1322, 17, 1862, 152, 522, 688, 47, 8, 3536, 4, 445, 2305, 441, 137, 3, 1299, 71, 5412, 158, 492, 1840, 371, 32, 543, 14, 3, 336, 258, 3440, 3, 2305, 710, 1642, 47, 8, 923, 64, 4792, 2, 40, 570, 1583, 1, 3766, 130, 18, 125, 1642, 40, 8, 561, 2450, 412, 6, 255, 7, 54, 47, 2986, 3, 1185, 145, 27, 3, 1259, 1642, 40, 2264, 5, 1048, 787, 2, 5860, 77, 282, 39, 125, 1642, 40, 8, 2884, 3892, 9, 3, 343, 1, 3, 2264, 1259, 2, 33, 125, 1642, 40, 8, 2450, 596, 1, 2196, 252, 98, 17, 3, 69, 71, 85, 3733, 20, 1862, 152, 522, 4, 26, 17923, 21, 206, 392, 2305, 441, 2, 2419, 135, 1257, 1862, 152, 822, 40, 999, 22, 21, 7586, 125, 32, 747, 2160, 6, 3620, 3, 1299, 4, 445, 186, 2305, 12, 2040, 3, 31059, 34, 2040, 92, 3362, 296, 1, 3, 365, 371, 11402, 2090, 2, 1257, 1862, 152, 16, 96, 999, 32, 3, 267, 18, 232, 1293, 2298, 325, 2040, 34160, 31017, 2, 3, 139, 2200, 4564, 134, 35, 402, 247, 1, 3, 171, 898, 3105, 71, 85, 3, 193, 1, 2788, 2, 1283, 2411, 17, 2381, 3, 1436, 308, 695, 735, 20, 112, 336, 138, 445, 1, 46, 2411, 47, 443, 209, 4, 7, 5, 795, 131, 15, 113, 163, 2, 125, 16, 3, 1420, 17, 491, 303, 4361, 2524, 4, 3017, 3, 7201, 1, 393, 37, 4, 7, 19539, 6, 690, 8, 2305, 12]",2238.0,17308850,301
Nectin-1 is a marker of thyroid cancer sensitivity to herpes oncolytic therapy.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2007-02-27,"The prognosis for patients diagnosed with anaplastic thyroid cancer is dismal, with a median survival time of only 6 months. Novel therapies are needed for these and other thyroid cancers that are refractory to conventional therapy. Our goals were to assess the ability of an attenuated, replication-competent, oncolytic herpes virus (NV1023) to enter and lyse human thyroid cancers and determine whether herpes simplex virus receptor expression is a determinant of NV1023 efficacy. A panel of 12 human thyroid cancer cell lines including anaplastic, medullary, follicular, and papillary cancers were exposed to NV1023 and assessed for susceptibility to viral entry and oncolysis. The expression of herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D receptors nectin-1 and herpes virus entry mediator was assessed by quantitative fluorescence-activated cell sorter and correlated with NV1023 entry and oncolysis. There was significant variation in the ability of NV1023 to enter thyroid cancer cells as measured by lacZ expression. Thyroid cancer nectin-1 expression correlated strongly with NV1023 entry. Nectin-1 transfections and antibody receptor blocking studies validated the importance of nectin-1 for NV1023 entry. Follicular cancers were least sensitive to NV1023 oncolysis. All anaplastic, medullary, and papillary cancers tested exhibited greater than 85% cytotoxicity 7 d after exposure to NV1023 at multiplicity of infection 1, although oncolysis was variable at multiplicity of infection 0.01. Significant correlations between nectin-1 expression and NV1023 oncolysis were identified using Pearson's coefficients.

Altered VDR-mediated transcriptional activity in prostate cancer stroma.,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Stromal cells isolated from benign and malignant associated stroma (BAS and CAS) of a human clinical sample have been determined to contain similar levels of functional 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) receptor (VDR). However, VDR-mediated reporter activity of the luciferase reporter has been found to be limited 7-9-fold in CAS compared to 14-16-fold in BAS. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicate that in the absence of added ligand VDR interact with the silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone (SMRT) corepressor in both cell types, with higher recruitment in CAS as compared to BAS cells. In the presence of added ligand, VDR in CAS cells exhibited decreased ligand-inducible DNA binding activity, altered recruitment of coregulators SRC-1 and CBP, and increased recruitment of SMRT corepressor, as compared to BAS. Additionally, overexpression of wild-type VDR recovered VDR-mediated transaction of CYP24 luciferase reporter.

Diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FDG PET in restaging patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma and elevated calcitonin levels.,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",J. Nucl. Med.,2007-04-01,"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a rare endocrine tumor arising from the C-cells of the thyroid gland. Calcitonin is the principal serum tumor marker. A rising calcitonin level after total thyroidectomy for localized disease generally indicates residual, recurrent, or metastatic disease. The role of (18)F-FDG PET in MTC remains somewhat unclear. We reviewed our own experience with (18)F-FDG PET in postthyroidectomy MTC patients with elevated calcitonin. From our database, we identified patients with suspected residual, recurrent, or metastatic MTC and elevated calcitonin who had been referred for (18)F-FDG PET between January 2000 and October 2005. (18)F-FDG PET findings were classified as positive or negative on the basis of visual interpretation of the scan. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) were also calculated. The (18)F-FDG PET findings were verified by histopathologic examination, when available, or other imaging studies and clinical follow-up. Any negative (18)F-FDG PET result was considered false-negative. Twenty-eight patients underwent a total of 38 (18)F-FDG PET studies. Calcitonin levels ranged from 106 to 541,000 pg/mL (median, 7,260 pg/mL). There were 23 true-positive, 1 false-positive, and 14 false-negative (18)F-FDG PET scans, yielding an overall sensitivity of 62%. There was no true-positive finding when calcitonin levels were below 509 pg/mL (n = 5). Using an arbitrary cutoff of 1,000 pg/mL, we found that the sensitivity in scans with calcitonin levels greater than 1,000 pg/mL increased to 78% (21/27; 95% confidence interval, 58%-91%). The mean SUV of all lesions with (18)F-FDG uptake was 5.3 +/- 3.2 (range, 2.0-15.9). Among the 14 patients with false-negative (18)F-FDG PET findings, 8 had concurrent anatomic imaging studies and only 2 of these had positive findings. (18)F-FDG PET can detect residual, recurrent, or metastatic MTC with a reasonable sensitivity of 78% when the calcitonin level is above 1,000 pg/mL but appears of limited use if the calcitonin level is below 500 pg/mL.",Journal Article,4678.0,109.0,"Medullary carcinoma MTC is a rare endocrine tumor arising from the C-cells of the gland Calcitonin is the principal serum tumor marker A rising calcitonin level after total thyroidectomy for localized disease generally indicates residual recurrent or metastatic disease The role of 18 F-FDG PET in MTC remains somewhat unclear We reviewed our own experience with 18 F-FDG PET in postthyroidectomy MTC patients with elevated calcitonin From our database we identified patients with suspected residual recurrent or metastatic MTC and elevated calcitonin who had been referred for 18 F-FDG PET between January 2000 and October 2005 18 F-FDG PET findings were classified as positive or negative on the basis of visual interpretation of the scan Standardized uptake values SUVs were also calculated The 18 F-FDG PET findings were verified by histopathologic examination when available or other imaging studies and clinical follow-up Any negative 18 F-FDG PET result was considered false-negative Twenty-eight patients underwent a total of 38 18 F-FDG PET studies Calcitonin levels ranged from 106 to 541,000 pg/mL median 7,260 pg/mL There were 23 true-positive 1 false-positive and 14 false-negative 18 F-FDG PET scans yielding an overall sensitivity of 62 There was no true-positive finding when calcitonin levels were below 509 pg/mL n 5 Using an arbitrary cutoff of 1,000 pg/mL we found that the sensitivity in scans with calcitonin levels greater than 1,000 pg/mL increased to 78 21/27 95 confidence interval 58 -91 The mean SUV of all lesions with 18 F-FDG uptake was 5.3 +/- 3.2 range 2.0-15.9 Among the 14 patients with false-negative 18 F-FDG PET findings 8 had concurrent anatomic imaging studies and only 2 of these had positive findings 18 F-FDG PET can detect residual recurrent or metastatic MTC with a reasonable sensitivity of 78 when the calcitonin level is above 1,000 pg/mL but appears of limited use if the calcitonin level is below 500 pg/mL",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[4564, 134, 3959, 16, 8, 622, 1293, 30, 2635, 29, 3, 256, 37, 1, 3, 2326, 11314, 16, 3, 4312, 524, 30, 952, 8, 3699, 11314, 301, 50, 181, 5949, 9, 909, 34, 1228, 2640, 753, 387, 15, 113, 34, 3, 200, 1, 203, 1068, 1285, 495, 4, 3959, 469, 6122, 1200, 21, 446, 114, 4165, 730, 5, 203, 1068, 1285, 495, 4, 44677, 3959, 7, 5, 804, 11314, 29, 114, 609, 21, 108, 7, 5, 2768, 753, 387, 15, 113, 3959, 2, 804, 11314, 54, 42, 85, 1995, 9, 203, 1068, 1285, 495, 59, 1024, 1081, 2, 2551, 1242, 203, 1068, 1285, 495, 272, 11, 1373, 22, 109, 15, 199, 23, 3, 877, 1, 3046, 3037, 1, 3, 1657, 1670, 1135, 1030, 9506, 11, 120, 981, 3, 203, 1068, 1285, 495, 272, 11, 4815, 20, 2630, 1385, 198, 390, 15, 127, 270, 94, 2, 38, 166, 126, 500, 199, 203, 1068, 1285, 495, 757, 10, 515, 2133, 199, 737, 659, 7, 208, 8, 181, 1, 519, 203, 1068, 1285, 495, 94, 11314, 148, 1869, 29, 3251, 6, 10749, 984, 3234, 542, 52, 67, 6398, 3234, 542, 125, 11, 382, 2501, 109, 14, 2133, 109, 2, 213, 2133, 199, 203, 1068, 1285, 495, 1441, 4949, 35, 63, 485, 1, 744, 125, 10, 77, 2501, 109, 1567, 198, 11314, 148, 11, 2736, 8727, 3234, 542, 78, 33, 75, 35, 16183, 2779, 1, 14, 984, 3234, 542, 21, 204, 17, 3, 485, 4, 1441, 5, 11314, 148, 378, 76, 14, 984, 3234, 542, 101, 6, 833, 239, 428, 48, 307, 268, 717, 970, 3, 313, 2217, 1, 62, 406, 5, 203, 1068, 1285, 1135, 10, 33, 27, 27, 18, 184, 18, 13, 167, 83, 107, 3, 213, 7, 5, 2133, 199, 203, 1068, 1285, 495, 272, 66, 42, 750, 2745, 270, 94, 2, 158, 18, 1, 46, 42, 109, 272, 203, 1068, 1285, 495, 122, 1426, 753, 387, 15, 113, 3959, 5, 8, 3203, 485, 1, 833, 198, 3, 11314, 301, 16, 2090, 14, 984, 3234, 542, 84, 1233, 1, 383, 119, 492, 3, 11314, 301, 16, 2736, 1666, 3234, 542]",1956.0,17401085,67
PTEN regulates phospholipase D and phospholipase C.,Human molecular genetics,Hum. Mol. Genet.,2007-04-03,"PTEN is an ubiquitously expressed tumor suppressor which plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis of many types of sporadic solid tumors, including breast cancer, as well as hematologic malignancies. Germline PTEN mutations cause 85% of Cowden syndrome (CS), characterized by a high risk of breast and thyroid cancers, and 65% of Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), characterized by lipomatosis, hemangiomas and speckled penis. Historically, PTEN's role in tumor suppression has been linked to the down-regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway by PTEN's lipid phosphatase activity. Beyond the AKT pathway, however, there has been minimal examination of PTEN's responsibility in lipid-derived cellular signaling. As phospholipids have been shown to be critical components in signal transduction and cellular proliferation and PTEN controls cellular phospholipid levels, we hypothesized that PTEN functions as a regulator of lipid signaling and homeostasis. Increased PTEN expression in unstimulated MCF-7 breast cancer cells results in a 51% increase in phosphatidic acid, with a decrease in phosphatidylcholine, suggesting that PTEN may regulate phospholipase D (PLD). PTEN overexpression results in a 30% increase in basal PLD activity. As phospholipase C (PLC) is both involved in PLD activation and is regulated by PIP2/3 levels, we investigated the role of PTEN on PLC activation. Our data suggest that PTEN modulates PLC:PLD activation pathways and indicate that the pathogenesis of CS/BRRS has a more complex biochemical basis beyond simply activating the PI3K pathway. This provides alternative routes for PTEN's tumor suppressor action that may be beneficial in the creation of novel targets for cancer therapy and prevention.",Journal Article,4676.0,14.0,PTEN is an ubiquitously expressed tumor suppressor which plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis of many types of sporadic solid tumors including cancer as well as hematologic malignancies Germline PTEN mutations cause 85 of Cowden syndrome CS characterized by a high risk of and cancers and 65 of Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome BRRS characterized by lipomatosis hemangiomas and speckled penis Historically PTEN 's role in tumor suppression has been linked to the down-regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway by PTEN 's lipid phosphatase activity Beyond the AKT pathway however there has been minimal examination of PTEN 's responsibility in lipid-derived cellular signaling As phospholipids have been shown to be critical components in signal transduction and cellular proliferation and PTEN controls cellular phospholipid levels we hypothesized that PTEN functions as a regulator of lipid signaling and homeostasis Increased PTEN expression in unstimulated MCF-7 cancer cells results in a 51 increase in phosphatidic acid with a decrease in phosphatidylcholine suggesting that PTEN may regulate phospholipase D PLD PTEN overexpression results in a 30 increase in basal PLD activity As phospholipase C PLC is both involved in PLD activation and is regulated by PIP2/3 levels we investigated the role of PTEN on PLC activation Our data suggest that PTEN modulates PLC PLD activation pathways and indicate that the pathogenesis of CS/BRRS has a more complex biochemical basis beyond simply activating the PI3K pathway This provides alternative routes for PTEN 's tumor suppressor action that may be beneficial in the creation of novel targets for cancer therapy and prevention,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[820, 16, 35, 11156, 570, 30, 1245, 92, 1698, 8, 3689, 200, 4, 3, 1384, 1, 445, 630, 1, 1928, 537, 57, 141, 12, 22, 149, 22, 813, 441, 1009, 820, 138, 708, 772, 1, 5561, 681, 2188, 765, 20, 8, 64, 43, 1, 2, 163, 2, 556, 1, 12484, 12485, 12486, 681, 10860, 765, 20, 33192, 11984, 2, 33193, 10954, 3578, 820, 292, 200, 4, 30, 1332, 71, 85, 1199, 6, 3, 1328, 863, 1, 3, 974, 649, 308, 20, 820, 292, 3121, 2577, 128, 1654, 3, 649, 308, 137, 125, 71, 85, 1048, 1385, 1, 820, 292, 13403, 4, 3121, 526, 763, 314, 22, 19421, 47, 85, 443, 6, 40, 740, 1628, 4, 1235, 2761, 2, 763, 457, 2, 820, 535, 763, 13476, 148, 21, 1237, 17, 820, 1681, 22, 8, 2452, 1, 3121, 314, 2, 4975, 101, 820, 55, 4, 16781, 3252, 67, 12, 37, 99, 4, 8, 725, 344, 4, 33168, 971, 5, 8, 775, 4, 14069, 802, 17, 820, 68, 2288, 16685, 427, 3793, 820, 851, 99, 4, 8, 201, 344, 4, 2135, 3793, 128, 22, 16685, 256, 13064, 16, 110, 646, 4, 3793, 363, 2, 16, 1065, 20, 44680, 27, 148, 21, 565, 3, 200, 1, 820, 23, 13064, 363, 114, 74, 309, 17, 820, 5259, 13064, 3793, 363, 460, 2, 1008, 17, 3, 1384, 1, 2188, 10860, 71, 8, 80, 840, 1487, 877, 1654, 8908, 1616, 3, 974, 308, 26, 777, 1091, 9421, 9, 820, 292, 30, 1245, 1578, 17, 68, 40, 2524, 4, 3, 7560, 1, 229, 637, 9, 12, 36, 2, 1070]",1676.0,17405772,357

Sorafenib inhibits the angiogenesis and growth of orthotopic anaplastic thyroid carcinoma xenografts in nude mice.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2007-06-01,"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) remains one of the most lethal human cancers. We hypothesized that sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor of the BRaf, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta kinase, would decrease tumor growth and angiogenesis in an orthotopic model of ATC. The in vitro antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of sorafenib on ATC cell lines were examined. To study the in vivo effects of sorafenib on orthotopic ATC tumors in nude mice, sorafenib was given p.o. at 40 or 80 mg/kg daily. Intratumoral effects were studied using immunohistochemical analysis. The effect of sorafenib on survival of the mice was also studied. Sorafenib inhibited the in vitro proliferation of ATC cell lines. Sorafenib also significantly inhibited tumor angiogenesis via the induction of endothelial apoptosis in an orthotopic model of thyroid cancer. As result, the growth of orthotopic ATC xenografts was reduced and the survival of the test animals was improved. Sorafenib exerts significant antitumor activity in an orthotopic xenograft model of ATC via a potent antiangiogenic effect. The antiangiogenic effects of sorafenib suggest that its use in clinical setting may not depend on the BRAF mutational status of thyroid tumors.

Vaccinations were administered at weeks 1, 2, 3, 7, and 15. Periodic blood and urine samples were obtained to monitor safety (complete blood count, comprehensive panel, amylase, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and urinalysis) and antibody production (ELISA, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and complement-dependent cytotoxicity). Eleven patients were included in the safety analysis; 9 of 11 patients remained on study for at least 2 weeks past fourth vaccination and were included in the immunologic analysis (two withdrew, disease progression). The vaccine was well tolerated. Self-limited and mild fatigue (maximum grade 2 in two patients), fever, myalgia, and localized injection site reactions were most frequent. No clinically relevant hematologic abnormalities were noted. No clinical or laboratory evidence of autoimmunity was seen. Serologic responses by ELISA were largely IgM against each antigen with the exception of Tn-MUC1 where both IgM and IgG responses were induced. Antibody responses were generally undetectable before immunization.

Downregulation of Rap1GAP contributes to Ras transformation.,Molecular and cellular biology,Mol. Cell. Biol.,2007-07-23,"Although abundant in well-differentiated rat thyroid cells, Rap1GAP expression was extinguished in a subset of human thyroid tumor-derived cell lines. Intriguingly, Rap1GAP was downregulated selectively in tumor cell lines that had acquired a mesenchymal morphology. Restoring Rap1GAP expression to these cells inhibited cell migration and invasion, effects that were correlated with the inhibition of Rap1 and Rac1 activity. The reexpression of Rap1GAP also inhibited DNA synthesis and anchorage-independent proliferation. Conversely, eliminating Rap1GAP expression in rat thyroid cells induced a transient increase in cell number. Strikingly, Rap1GAP expression was abolished by Ras transformation. The downregulation of Rap1GAP by Ras required the activation of the Raf/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase cascade and was correlated with the induction of mesenchymal morphology and migratory behavior. Remarkably, the acute expression of oncogenic Ras was sufficient to downregulate Rap1GAP expression in rat thyroid cells, identifying Rap1GAP as a novel target of oncogenic Ras. Collectively, these data implicate Rap1GAP as a putative tumor/invasion suppressor in the thyroid. In support of that notion, Rap1GAP was highly expressed in normal human thyroid cells and downregulated in primary thyroid tumors.",Journal Article,4565.0,45.0,Although abundant in well-differentiated rat cells Rap1GAP expression was extinguished in a subset of human tumor-derived cell lines Intriguingly Rap1GAP was downregulated selectively in tumor cell lines that had acquired a mesenchymal morphology Restoring Rap1GAP expression to these cells inhibited cell migration and invasion effects that were correlated with the inhibition of Rap1 and Rac1 activity The reexpression of Rap1GAP also inhibited DNA synthesis and anchorage-independent proliferation Conversely eliminating Rap1GAP expression in rat cells induced a transient increase in cell number Strikingly Rap1GAP expression was abolished by Ras transformation The downregulation of Rap1GAP by Ras required the activation of the Raf/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase cascade and was correlated with the induction of mesenchymal morphology and migratory behavior Remarkably the acute expression of oncogenic Ras was sufficient to downregulate Rap1GAP expression in rat cells identifying Rap1GAP as a novel target of oncogenic Ras Collectively these data implicate Rap1GAP as a putative tumor/invasion suppressor in the In support of that notion Rap1GAP was highly expressed in normal human cells and downregulated in primary tumors,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[242, 4834, 4, 149, 1442, 4008, 37, 9526, 55, 10, 28697, 4, 8, 697, 1, 171, 30, 526, 31, 285, 11550, 9526, 10, 3315, 2382, 4, 30, 31, 285, 17, 42, 1294, 8, 1569, 2567, 8364, 9526, 55, 6, 46, 37, 879, 31, 1381, 2, 578, 176, 17, 11, 438, 5, 3, 297, 1, 14946, 2, 8729, 128, 3, 11120, 1, 9526, 120, 879, 261, 2525, 2, 5573, 306, 457, 3154, 6923, 9526, 55, 4, 4008, 37, 277, 8, 2473, 344, 4, 31, 207, 6787, 9526, 55, 10, 6020, 20, 1102, 1392, 3, 2475, 1, 9526, 20, 1102, 616, 3, 363, 1, 3, 2212, 1693, 1976, 1235, 1065, 216, 4678, 2, 10, 438, 5, 3, 504, 1, 1569, 2567, 2, 7757, 1710, 4856, 3, 286, 55, 1, 1302, 1102, 10, 1952, 6, 10261, 9526, 55, 4, 4008, 37, 1386, 9526, 22, 8, 229, 283, 1, 1302, 1102, 2535, 46, 74, 5545, 9526, 22, 8, 2743, 30, 578, 1245, 4, 3, 4, 538, 1, 17, 6691, 9526, 10, 561, 570, 4, 295, 171, 37, 2, 3315, 4, 86, 57]",1243.0,17646383,201
Lifestyle factors and duration of androgen deprivation affect bone mineral density of patients with prostate cancer during first year of therapy.,Urology,Urology,2007-07-01,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is associated with loss of bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk. We sought to examine the impact of ADT and lifestyle variables on BMD in 120 patients with prostate cancer without bone metastases entering a randomized clinical trial. A total of 120 patients with prostate cancer and without bone metastases who had been treated with ADT for less than 12 months were enrolled in a clinical trial of zoledronic acid versus placebo. BMD measurements of the femoral neck, total hip, and lumbar spine were obtained before starting the study treatment by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. The subjects answered a questionnaire regarding possible osteoporosis risk factors, including dairy product use, caffeinated beverage use, smoking history, alcohol intake, calcium/vitamin D supplementation, thyroid medication, and exercise. The median duration of ADT was 3 months (range 0 to 12). Osteopenia or osteoporosis (T score of less than -1) was detected in two thirds of the subjects at one or more measured sites. The mean baseline BMD Z scores were femoral neck -0.091 +/- 0.959, total hip 0.122 +/- 1.005, and lumbar spine 0.657 +/- 1.789.

Followup of patients with papillary thyroid cancer: in search of the optimal algorithm.,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,J. Am. Coll. Surg.,2007-06-18,"Cervical recurrence occurs in up to 30% of patients after surgical treatment for papillary thyroid cancer. This study sought to determine an appropriate algorithm for followup evaluation. Patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer were identified. Clinicopathologic data were recorded, as were the results of all followup evaluations including radioiodine scan, cervical ultrasonography, and serum thyroglobulin levels. The disease recurrence-free survival probability was estimated, and risk factors for recurrence were determined. Thyroidectomy with or without neck dissection was performed in 162 patients. We excluded 36 patients (followup less than 6 months in 26, extracervical disease at diagnosis in 4, unknown tumor size in 6) from the analysis. Of the remaining 126 patients, 109 (86.5%) had no evidence of disease, with serum thyroglobulin < 1 ng/mL at last followup; 4 (3.2%) had no evidence of disease (negative imaging), with serum thyroglobulin > 1 ng/mL, and 13 (10.3%) had recurrent disease. Cervical recurrence occurred in nine patients, all detected by routine ultrasonography. Pulmonary metastases occurred in four patients; three were diagnosed by chest CT and one by radioiodine scan. Thyroid stimulating hormone-suppressed thyroglobulin levels were available in 11 of the 13 patients and were elevated in 9. Patients with high T stage (extrathyroidal extension), or high N stage had an increased risk of recurrence. A followup strategy emphasizing routine cervical ultrasonography and unstimulated thyroglobulin is effective in identifying patients with recurrent papillary thyroid cancer, and may minimize the indiscriminate use of therapeutic radioiodine for radiographically occult disease.

"The tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AZD2171, inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor signaling and growth of anaplastic thyroid cancer in an orthotopic nude mouse model.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2007-08-01,"Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a locally aggressive type of thyroid tumor with high rate of distant metastases. With conventional treatment, the median survival ranges from 4 to 12 months; therefore, new treatment options are needed. AZD2171 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3. The objective of the study is to determine whether AZD2171 can inhibit VEGFR-2 signaling and decrease tumor growth and prolong survival of ATC in an orthotopic nude mouse model. We examined the effects of AZD2171 on phosphorylation of VEGFR-2, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and AKT in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells. To determine the antiproliferative and antiapoptotic effects of AZD2171, we did 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and flow cytometry assays, respectively. We assessed the antitumor effects of AZD2171 in a xenograft model of ATC using control, AZD2171, paclitaxel, and combination groups by measuring tumor size and survival. Treatment with AZD2171 led to dose-dependent inhibition of VEGFR-2 phosphorylation and its downstream signaling in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (IC(50) for cell proliferation, 500 nmol/L). In the ATC cell lines DRO and ARO, IC(50) was 7.5 micromol/L. AZD2171 induced apoptosis in 50% of endothelial and ATC cells at 3 and 10 micromol/L concentrations, respectively. In vivo, AZD2171 led to a significant reduction in tumor size between control and AZD2171 (P = 0.002) or AZD2171 + paclitaxel group (P = 0.002) but not the paclitaxel alone group (P = 0.11). Survival was significantly higher among AZD2171 (P < 0.001) and combination groups (P < 0.001) compared with control.

Cowden syndrome-affected patients with PTEN promoter mutations demonstrate abnormal protein translation.,American journal of human genetics,Am. J. Hum. Genet.,2007-08-15,"Germline mutations of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) are associated with the multihamartomatous disorder Cowden syndrome (CS). Moreover, patients with CS with germline PTEN promoter mutations have aberrant PTEN protein expression and an increased frequency of breast cancer. Here, we examined the downstream effect of five PTEN promoter variants (-861G/T, -853C/G, -834C/T, -798G/C, and -764G/A) that are not within any known cis-acting regulatory elements. Clinically, all five of these patients have been given diagnoses of breast, thyroid, and/or endometrial cancer. We demonstrated that protein binding to the PTEN promoter (-893 to -755) was not altered in the five variants when compared with the wild-type (WT) promoter. However, reporter assays indicated that three of the variants (-861G/T, -853C/G, and -764G/A) demonstrated an ~50% decrease in luciferase activity compared with the WT construct. PTEN messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were not altered in these variants, whereas secondary structure predictions indicated that different PTEN 5' untranslated region transcript-folding patterns exist in three variants, suggesting an inhibition of protein translation. This was confirmed by PTEN protein analysis. These data indicate that variants causing large mRNA secondary structure alterations result in an inhibition of protein translation and a decrease in PTEN protein expression. These data emphasize the importance of PTEN promoter nucleotide variations and their ability to lead to CS progression by a novel regulatory mechanism. Importantly, these patients have a high prevalence of breast, thyroid, and endometrial malignancies; thus, understanding of the mechanism of PTEN dysfunction in these patients will lead to more-sensitive molecular diagnostic and predictive testing and, ultimately, to rational targeted therapies to treat or prevent malignancy.",Journal Article,4542.0,56.0,Germline mutations of PTEN phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 are associated with the multihamartomatous disorder Cowden syndrome CS Moreover patients with CS with germline PTEN promoter mutations have aberrant PTEN protein expression and an increased frequency of cancer Here we examined the downstream effect of five PTEN promoter variants -861G/T -853C/G -834C/T -798G/C and -764G/A that are not within any known cis-acting regulatory elements Clinically all five of these patients have been given diagnoses of and/or cancer We demonstrated that protein binding to the PTEN promoter -893 to -755 was not altered in the five variants when compared with the wild-type WT promoter However reporter assays indicated that three of the variants -861G/T -853C/G and -764G/A demonstrated an ~50 decrease in luciferase activity compared with the WT construct PTEN messenger RNA mRNA levels were not altered in these variants whereas secondary structure predictions indicated that different PTEN 5 untranslated region transcript-folding patterns exist in three variants suggesting an inhibition of protein translation This was confirmed by PTEN protein analysis These data indicate that variants causing large mRNA secondary structure alterations result in an inhibition of protein translation and a decrease in PTEN protein expression These data emphasize the importance of PTEN promoter nucleotide variations and their ability to lead to CS progression by a novel regulatory mechanism Importantly these patients have a high prevalence of and malignancies thus understanding of the mechanism of PTEN dysfunction in these patients will lead to more-sensitive molecular diagnostic and predictive testing and ultimately to rational targeted therapies to treat or prevent malignancy,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[1009, 138, 1, 820, 2577, 2, 6111, 3412, 4389, 23, 1170, 79, 32, 41, 5, 3, 56520, 2645, 5561, 681, 2188, 1393, 7, 5, 2188, 5, 1009, 820, 973, 138, 47, 1898, 820, 178, 55, 2, 35, 101, 675, 1, 12, 467, 21, 409, 3, 1489, 254, 1, 365, 820, 973, 839, 44851, 102, 44852, 499, 56521, 102, 56522, 256, 2, 44853, 8, 17, 32, 44, 262, 500, 440, 1927, 5375, 1253, 2531, 505, 62, 365, 1, 46, 7, 47, 85, 447, 2403, 1, 2, 15, 12, 21, 264, 17, 178, 791, 6, 3, 820, 973, 12651, 6, 14753, 10, 44, 1495, 4, 3, 365, 839, 198, 72, 5, 3, 955, 267, 1820, 973, 137, 3674, 1013, 1103, 17, 169, 1, 3, 839, 44851, 102, 44852, 499, 2, 44853, 8, 264, 35, 212, 775, 4, 3864, 128, 72, 5, 3, 1820, 3883, 820, 5992, 893, 956, 148, 11, 44, 1495, 4, 46, 839, 547, 568, 2772, 4340, 1103, 17, 338, 820, 33, 7379, 1053, 3268, 12992, 764, 1923, 4, 169, 839, 802, 35, 297, 1, 178, 2691, 26, 10, 557, 20, 820, 178, 65, 46, 74, 1008, 17, 839, 3440, 375, 956, 568, 2772, 593, 757, 4, 35, 297, 1, 178, 2691, 2, 8, 775, 4, 820, 178, 55, 46, 74, 5560, 3, 1187, 1, 820, 973, 1579, 2293, 2, 136, 801, 6, 1122, 6, 2188, 91, 20, 8, 229, 1253, 670, 1859, 46, 7, 47, 8, 64, 1078, 1, 2, 441, 631, 612, 1, 3, 670, 1, 820, 1527, 4, 46, 7, 303, 1122, 6, 80, 745, 219, 752, 2, 464, 471, 2, 2050, 6, 2696, 238, 235, 6, 943, 15, 1682, 710]",1793.0,17847000,416

Cowden syndrome.,Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2007-10-01,"Cowden syndrome (CS), due to germline mutations of the PTEN tumor-suppressor gene, is an often overlooked cancer predisposition syndrome associated with an increased risk of breast, thyroid, and endometrial cancers, as well as benign manifestations. Germline PTEN mutations also are associated with syndromes that have not been historically connected to an increase in risk for malignancy. These disorders include Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), Proteus syndrome (PS), and Proteus-like syndrome (PSL). These syndromes can be described under the umbrella of PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS).

Growth factor receptors expression in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma: potential markers for therapeutic stratification.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2007-10-18,"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is a rare and universally fatal disease. Therefore, novel biomarkers are needed as surrogate end points in triaging patients for novel and selective biologic treatments. Up-regulation of several growth factor receptors has been shown to be associated with the biologic progression and response to targeted therapy of several malignancies. To determine the role of growth factor receptors in the biologic stratification of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, we studied the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta, and HER-2 receptor in a large cohort of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas by immunohistochemical techniques. The percentage of positive cells, staining intensity and localization of staining in the anaplastic component, and coexisting well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma and adjacent nonneoplastic thyroid were evaluated for these markers. EGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta, and HER-2 were overexpressed in 58%, 16%, and 16% of anaplastic carcinomas, respectively. In tumors with adjacent normal thyroid parenchyma and/or differentiated carcinoma components, overexpression of all 3 markers was noted exclusively in the anaplastic component. Mutational analysis of exons 18, 19, and 21 of the EGFR gene showed no mutations in all anaplastic carcinomas. We conclude that the expression of these markers (1) may play a role in a subset of thyroid tumorigenesis and anaplastic transformation and (2) can be validated for potential use in the stratification of patients for targeted therapy.",Evaluation Study,4478.0,32.0,Anaplastic carcinoma is a rare and universally fatal disease Therefore novel biomarkers are needed as surrogate end points in triaging patients for novel and selective biologic treatments Up-regulation of several growth factor receptors has been shown to be associated with the biologic progression and response to targeted therapy of several malignancies To determine the role of growth factor receptors in the biologic stratification of anaplastic carcinoma we studied the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta and HER-2 receptor in a large cohort of anaplastic carcinomas by immunohistochemical techniques The percentage of positive cells staining intensity and localization of staining in the anaplastic component and coexisting well-differentiated carcinoma and adjacent nonneoplastic were evaluated for these markers EGFR platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta and HER-2 were overexpressed in 58 16 and 16 of anaplastic carcinomas respectively In tumors with adjacent normal parenchyma and/or differentiated carcinoma components overexpression of all 3 markers was noted exclusively in the anaplastic component Mutational analysis of exons 18 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene showed no mutations in all anaplastic carcinomas We conclude that the expression of these markers 1 may play a role in a subset of tumorigenesis and anaplastic transformation and 2 can be validated for potential use in the stratification of patients for targeted therapy,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[1841, 134, 16, 8, 622, 2, 6813, 3034, 34, 673, 229, 582, 32, 575, 22, 2592, 396, 862, 4, 22450, 7, 9, 229, 2, 1094, 1283, 640, 126, 863, 1, 392, 129, 161, 1186, 71, 85, 443, 6, 40, 41, 5, 3, 1283, 91, 2, 51, 6, 238, 36, 1, 392, 441, 6, 223, 3, 200, 1, 129, 161, 1186, 4, 3, 1283, 1541, 1, 1841, 134, 21, 656, 3, 55, 1, 829, 129, 161, 153, 227, 1596, 526, 129, 161, 153, 1090, 2, 1084, 18, 153, 4, 8, 375, 180, 1, 1841, 826, 20, 1382, 1092, 3, 1150, 1, 109, 37, 1029, 837, 2, 2145, 1, 1029, 4, 3, 1841, 1249, 2, 8859, 149, 1442, 134, 2, 2086, 9563, 11, 194, 9, 46, 525, 227, 1596, 526, 129, 161, 153, 1090, 2, 1084, 18, 11, 1711, 4, 717, 245, 2, 245, 1, 1841, 826, 106, 4, 57, 5, 2086, 295, 5388, 2, 15, 1442, 134, 1628, 851, 1, 62, 27, 525, 10, 1051, 4437, 4, 3, 1841, 1249, 1619, 65, 1, 3885, 203, 326, 2, 239, 1, 3, 227, 145, 224, 77, 138, 4, 62, 1841, 826, 21, 2060, 17, 3, 55, 1, 46, 525, 14, 68, 1343, 8, 200, 4, 8, 697, 1, 1565, 2, 1841, 1392, 2, 18, 122, 40, 938, 9, 174, 119, 4, 3, 1541, 1, 7, 9, 238, 36]",1511.0,17949783,248

A versatile bifunctional chelate for radiolabeling humanized anti-CEA antibody with In-111 and Cu-64 at either thiol or amino groups: PET imaging of CEA-positive tumors with whole antibodies.,Bioconjugate chemistry,Bioconjug. Chem.,2007-11-08,"Radiolabeled anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) antibodies have the potential to give excellent images of a wide variety of human tumors, including tumors of the colon, breast, lung, and medullar thyroid. In order to realize the goals of routine and repetitive clinical imaging with anti-CEA antibodies, it is necessary that the antibodies have a high affinity for CEA, low cross reactivity and uptake in normal tissues, and low immunogenicity. The humanized anti-CEA antibody hT84.66-M5A (M5A) fulfills these criteria with an affinity constant of >10 (10) M (-1), no reactivity with CEA cross-reacting antigens found in normal tissues, and >90% human protein sequence.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/akt and ras/raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway mutations in anaplastic thyroid cancer.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2007-11-07,"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) can occur in the setting of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC), which suggests a continuum in malignant progression from DTC to ATC. The Ras/Raf-MAPK and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathways play critical roles in DTC tumorigenesis, but their roles in the pathogenesis of ATC are poorly defined. Our objective was to explore the potential contributions of these two pathways in ATC pathogenesis. The mutational status of BRAF, PIK3CA, PTEN, and RAS genes was analyzed in genomic DNA from microdissected tumor specimens of 36 cases of ATC, and in 16 samples of paired-matched lymph node metastases. PIK3CA copy number gain was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR. We performed immunohistochemistry for phospho-ERK and phospho-AKT in 26 cases of ATC. DTC was present in half of the cases. BRAF V600E mutation was identified in nine of 36 (25%) ATCs; seven cases had identical mutations in both the ATC and DTC components. PIK3CA kinase domain mutations were found in five (14%) ATCs, one of which had mutations in both differentiated and anaplastic areas. RAS and PTEN mutations were each found in two (6%) ATCs. PIK3CA gain copy number was found notably increased in 14 (39%) ATCs. BRAF mutations appear to play a role in the tumorigenesis of a subset of ATCs, and the majority of lymph node metastases.

Novel chemotherapy options for advanced thyroid tumors: small molecules offer great hope.,Current opinion in oncology,Curr Opin Oncol,2008-01-01,"Endocrine tumors are often overlooked in medical oncology discussions, as many of them are effectively cured by surgery alone or surgery plus an ablative radiation therapy.

This has led to the evaluation of novel compounds; some of which have already entered into randomized clinical trials. This review will focus on the advances made in the treatment of advanced thyroid cancer, the commonest of endocrine malignancies. A growing understanding of molecular oncology has allowed the development of targeted agents in different types of thyroid cancer.

Treatment of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma in vitro with a mutant vaccinia virus.,Surgery,Surgery,2007-11-05,"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a fatal disease resistant to all conventional treatments. Novel therapies are needed to improve dismal outcomes. A replication-competent vaccinia virus (GLV-1h68) was engineered by inserting expression cassettes encoding Renilla luciferase-green fluorescent protein (GFP), beta-galactosidase, and beta-glucuronidase into the genome of LIVP strain. Infection of 6 ATC cell lines by GLV-1h68 was detected in vitro at 12, 24, and 36 hours. Viral proliferation was measured through viral plaque assays. Cytotoxicity was measured daily at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01, 0.1 and 1. Viral infection was detected in all cell lines by 24 hours and increased in intensity at 36 hours. Logarithmic viral replication was detected in all cell lines. At MOI 1, <13% cell survival was measured in 5 cell lines by day 7. At MOI 0.01, 3 cell lines showed <21% cell survival by day 7. Luciferase and beta-galactosidase activity at 24 hours correlated with cytotoxicity at MOI 0.01 on day 5.

Risk of hypothyroidism in older breast cancer patients treated with radiation.,Cancer,Cancer,2008-03-01,"Hypothyroidism is a potential complication after radiation therapy (RT) when treatment fields include the thyroid. The authors assessed risk of hypothyroidism in breast cancer patients who were receiving RT to a supraclavicular field, which typically includes a portion of thyroid. The authors identified 38,255 women (aged>65) without history of hypothyroidism from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare cohort diagnosed with stage 0-III breast cancer from 1992-2002 and 111,944 cancer-free controls. The authors compared hypothyroidism incidence among irradiated patients with 4+positive lymph nodes (4+LN, surrogate for supraclavicular RT) and no positive nodes (0 LN, surrogate for no supraclavicular RT), nonirradiated patients, and controls. Proportional hazards models tested associations of LN, RT, and breast cancer status with hypothyroidism. The 5-year incidence of hypothyroidism was identical (14%) in irradiated patients with 4+LN, 0 LN, and nonirradiated patients (P=.52). After adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, hypothyroidism risk was not increased in irradiated patients with 4+LN versus 0 LN (hazard ratio(HR)=1.04; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.89-1.23). However, all patients, regardless of RT status, were more likely to be diagnosed with hypothyroidism compared with cancer-free controls (HR=1.21; 95% CI, 1.17-1.25). Development of hypothyroidism is fairly common in older breast cancer survivors.

The basis of racial differences in the incidence of thyroid cancer.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2008-02-02,"The incidence of thyroid cancer in black Americans is half that in white Americans. It is unknown whether this gap represents a population difference in disease or is attributable to inferior cancer screening in the black population. A population-based cohort study of 53,990 patients (1973-2003) was performed using the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance Epidemiology End Results database. Socioeconomic variables were explored using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project database and macroeconomic data. Since 1973, thyroid cancer incidence among whites has increased 150.2% (4.0 to 9.9 of 100,000), while incidence among blacks has increased 73.2% (3.0 to 5.1 of 100,000). Across 17 regions, the incidence correlated with the percentage of the population with health insurance (r = 0.56, P = .02). Regression analysis suggested that half of the black-white incidence gap might be attributable to differences in health insurance status. Patients with thyroid cancer were more likely to be insured or reside in wealthier ZIP codes. Black patients were more likely to present at advanced age (RR 1.08, P < .0001) and with tumors >4 cm in size (RR 1.13, P <.0001). Black patients were slightly less likely to present with advanced disease (RR 0.96, P = .0008). Cancer-specific mortality was identical in the two populations.

Evidence-based surgical management of substernal goiter.,World journal of surgery,World J Surg,2008-07-01,"A number of reports have been published concerning the surgical treatment of substernal goiters; however, there is yet to be a comprehensive review of this body of literature using evidence-based methodology. This article is a systematic review of the literature using evidence-based criteria and a review of unpublished data from our institution. Issue 1. Limited level III/IV data suggest that the incidence of cancer in substernal goiters is not higher than the incidence of cancer in cervical goiters. Risk factors for malignancy in substernal goiters may include a family history of thyroid pathology, a history of cervical radiation therapy, recurrent goiter, and the presence of cervical adenopathy (grade C recommendation). Issue 2. Prospective level V data suggest that, for most patients, expert endocrine surgeons utilize an extracervical approach approximately 2% of the time to remove a substernal goiter safely; a sternotomy or thoracotomy appears more likely in cases of a primary substernal goiter or a mass larger than the thoracic inlet (no recommendation). Issue 3. There may be a higher rate of permanent hypoparathyroidism and unintentional permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve injury when total thyroidectomy is performed for removal of a substernal goiter than for removal of a cervical goiter alone (grade C recommendation). Injury of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve was not specifically addressed and is almost certainly underreported. Issue 4. The presence of a substernal goiter, especially being present more than 5 years and causing significant tracheal compression, is likely a risk factor for tracheomalacia and tracheostomy (grade C recommendation). Tracheomalacia with substernal goiter is an infrequent occurrence, and many cases of tracheomalacia can be managed without tracheostomy (no recommendation). Issue 5. Prospective level V data suggest that about 5% to 10% of operations for substernal goiters are performed because of recurrent or persistent disease, although retrospective level V data report an even higher rate, up to 37%. The most common initial operations with recurrence or persistence appear to be subtotal or hemithyroidectomy (no recommendation). Evidence-based recommendations provide reliable information regarding the pathologic findings and operative management of substernal goiters in expert hands.",Journal Article,4221.0,126.0,A number of reports have been published concerning the surgical treatment of substernal goiters however there is yet to be a comprehensive review of this body of literature using evidence-based methodology This article is a systematic review of the literature using evidence-based criteria and a review of unpublished data from our institution Issue 1 Limited level III/IV data suggest that the incidence of cancer in substernal goiters is not higher than the incidence of cancer in goiters Risk factors for malignancy in substernal goiters may include a family history of pathology a history of radiation therapy recurrent goiter and the presence of adenopathy grade C recommendation Issue 2 Prospective level V data suggest that for most patients expert endocrine surgeons utilize an extracervical approach approximately 2 of the time to remove a substernal goiter safely a sternotomy or thoracotomy appears more likely in cases of a primary substernal goiter or a mass larger than the thoracic inlet no recommendation Issue 3 There may be a higher rate of permanent hypoparathyroidism and unintentional permanent recurrent nerve injury when total thyroidectomy is performed for removal of a substernal goiter than for removal of a goiter alone grade C recommendation Injury of the external branch of the superior nerve was not specifically addressed and is almost certainly underreported Issue 4 The presence of a substernal goiter especially being present more than 5 years and causing significant tracheal compression is likely a risk factor for tracheomalacia and tracheostomy grade C recommendation Tracheomalacia with substernal goiter is an infrequent occurrence and many cases of tracheomalacia can be managed without tracheostomy no recommendation Issue 5 Prospective level V data suggest that about 5 to 10 of operations for substernal goiters are performed because of recurrent or persistent disease although retrospective level V data report an even higher rate up to 37 The most common initial operations with recurrence or persistence appear to be subtotal or hemithyroidectomy no recommendation Evidence-based recommendations provide reliable information regarding the pathologic findings and operative management of substernal goiters in expert hands,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,"[8, 207, 1, 1198, 47, 85, 983, 4243, 3, 221, 24, 1, 19660, 25063, 137, 125, 16, 1145, 6, 40, 8, 949, 206, 1, 26, 642, 1, 789, 75, 241, 90, 3209, 26, 946, 16, 8, 1556, 206, 1, 3, 789, 75, 241, 90, 371, 2, 8, 206, 1, 16010, 74, 29, 114, 731, 2537, 14, 383, 301, 316, 478, 74, 309, 17, 3, 287, 1, 12, 4, 19660, 25063, 16, 44, 142, 76, 3, 287, 1, 12, 4, 25063, 43, 130, 9, 710, 4, 19660, 25063, 68, 643, 8, 607, 532, 1, 1117, 8, 532, 1, 121, 36, 387, 16309, 2, 3, 463, 1, 7741, 88, 256, 3347, 2537, 18, 482, 301, 603, 74, 309, 17, 9, 96, 7, 2005, 1293, 1613, 6391, 35, 38497, 353, 705, 18, 1, 3, 98, 6, 7930, 8, 19660, 16309, 2268, 8, 23295, 15, 6103, 1233, 80, 322, 4, 140, 1, 8, 86, 19660, 16309, 15, 8, 782, 1077, 76, 3, 2098, 22397, 77, 3347, 2537, 27, 125, 68, 40, 8, 142, 116, 1, 4377, 23587, 2, 17350, 4377, 387, 2476, 2730, 198, 181, 5949, 16, 173, 9, 2829, 1, 8, 19660, 16309, 76, 9, 2829, 1, 8, 16309, 279, 88, 256, 3347, 2730, 1, 3, 1455, 7769, 1, 3, 1123, 2476, 10, 44, 1225, 2814, 2, 16, 2214, 13486, 14900, 2537, 39, 3, 463, 1, 8, 19660, 16309, 1093, 486, 364, 80, 76, 33, 60, 2, 3440, 93, 12898, 3481, 16, 322, 8, 43, 161, 9, 38648, 2, 15648, 88, 256, 3347, 38648, 5, 19660, 16309, 16, 35, 4475, 2291, 2, 445, 140, 1, 38648, 122, 40, 2231, 187, 15648, 77, 3347, 2537, 33, 482, 301, 603, 74, 309, 17, 545, 33, 6, 79, 1, 3867, 9, 19660, 25063, 32, 173, 408, 1, 387, 15, 1882, 34, 242, 459, 301, 603, 74, 414, 35, 871, 142, 116, 126, 6, 567, 3, 96, 186, 388, 3867, 5, 146, 15, 4108, 1322, 6, 40, 5503, 15, 38649, 77, 3347, 241, 90, 883, 377, 2450, 487, 666, 3, 510, 272, 2, 1208, 284, 1, 19660, 25063, 4, 2005, 10648]",2268.0,18266028,140

Endocrine outcomes for children with embryonal brain tumors after risk-adapted craniospinal and conformal primary-site irradiation and high-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell rescue on the SJMB-96 trial.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2008-03-01,"To estimate the cumulative incidence of specific hormone deficiencies and the influence of hypothalamic-pituitary (HP) axis radiation dose in a cohort of children with embryonal brain tumors treated with risk-adapted craniospinal irradiation (CSI), conformal primary site irradiation, and high-dose chemotherapy. Clinical data and HP axis radiation dosimetry data were obtained from 88 eligible children. All patients received regular endocrine follow-up that included screening tests of thyroid function and stimulation testing for growth hormone deficiency (GHD), and adrenocorticotropin hormone deficiency. The cumulative incidence of GHD, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiency, adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency, and primary hypothyroidism at 4 years from diagnosis was 93% +/- 4%, 23% +/- 8%, 38% +/- 6%, and 65% +/- 7%, respectively. Radiation dosimetry to the HP axis was associated only with the development of TSH deficiency; the 4-year cumulative incidence was 44% +/- 19% and 11% +/- 8% (P = .014) for those receiving more or less than the median dose to the hypothalamus (>or= 42 v < 42 Gy), respectively. The median dose of CSI for the average-risk (AR) patients was 23.4 and 39.6 Gy (36 to 40.5 Gy) for the high-risk patients. The estimated mean decline in height Z-score after radiation therapy was greater in high-risk patients (-0.65 units/yr) when compared with AR patients (-0.54 units/yr; P = .039).

BRAFV600E mutation is associated with preferential sensitivity to mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibition in thyroid cancer cell lines.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2008-04-01,"Mutually exclusive mutations of RET, RAS, or BRAF are present in about 70% of papillary thyroid carcinomas, whereas only the latter two are seen in poorly differentiated and anaplastic cancers. Although the signal output common to these oncoproteins is ERK, a recent report showed that only BRAF mutations consistently predicted responsiveness to MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors. Here we investigated whether sensitivity to MEK inhibition was determined by oncogene status in 13 human thyroid cancer cell lines: four with BRAF mutations, four RAS, one RET/PTC1, and four wild type. Growth of BRAF (+) cells was inhibited by the MEK antagonist PD0325901 with an IC(50) of less than 5 nm. By contrast, RAS, RET/PTC1, or wild-type cells had IC(50) of 4 nm to greater than 1000 nm. Sensitivity was not predicted by coexisting mutations in PIK3CA or by PTEN status. Similar effects were obtained with the MEK inhibitor AZD6244. PD0325901 induced a sustained G1/S arrest in BRAF (+) but not BRAF (-) lines. PD0325901 was equipotent at inhibiting pERK1/2 after 2 h, regardless of genetic background, but pERK rebounded at 24 h in most lines.

In part B, patients were stratified by cancer type (melanoma v other) and randomly assigned to receive the MTD or 50% MTD. Biopsies were collected to determine inhibition of ERK phosphorylation, Ki-67 expression, and BRAF, KRAS, and NRAS mutations. Fifty-seven patients were enrolled. MTD in part A was 200 mg bid, but this dose was discontinued in part B because of toxicity. The 50% MTD (100 mg bid) was well tolerated. Rash was the most frequent and dose-limiting toxicity. Most other adverse events were grade 1 or 2. The PKs were less than dose proportional, with a median half-life of approximately 8 hours and inhibition of ERK phosphorylation in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells at all dose levels. Paired tumor biopsies demonstrated reduced ERK phosphorylation (geometric mean, 79%).

Recombinant human TSH-assisted radioactive iodine remnant ablation achieves short-term clinical recurrence rates similar to those of traditional thyroid hormone withdrawal.,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",J. Nucl. Med.,2008-04-15,"Recent studies have confirmed that radioactive iodine therapy after recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) stimulation effectively ablates the normal thyroid remnant. However, no published study has determined the effectiveness of rhTSH preparations on the important endpoint of disease recurrence. Disease recurrence was retrospectively assessed a median of 2.5 y after radioiodine remnant ablation (RRA) in 394 consecutive thyroid cancer patients (93% papillary, 71% female, 47+/-15 y old [mean +/- SD], median (131)I dose of 3,996 MBq [108 mCi]). Similar rates of clinically evident disease recurrence (4% rhTSH vs. 7% thyroid hormone withdrawal [THW], P=not statistically significant) and residual thyroid bed uptake without other evidence of persistent disease (4% rhTSH vs. 7% THW, P=not statistically significant) were seen in the 320 patients undergoing rhTSH-assisted RRA and the 74 patients prepared for RRA by THW. When the definition of no clinical evidence of disease included a suppressed thyroglobulin level of less than 1 ng/mL and a stimulated thyroglobulin level of less than 2 ng/mL, rhTSH-assisted RRA was associated with significantly higher rates of no clinical evidence of disease (74% rhTSH vs. 55% THW, P=0.02) and significantly lower rates of persistent disease (19% rhTSH vs. 32% THW, P=0.02) than was RRA after THW.

Vitamin supplement use among children with Down's syndrome and risk of leukaemia: a Children's Oncology Group (COG) study.,Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol,2008-05-01,"Vitamin supplements have been proposed for children with Down's syndrome (DS) with claims of improving cognitive abilities, or immune or thyroid function. Several studies have shown decreased levels of zinc in this population. Because children with DS have a 50-fold increased risk of developing acute leukaemia during the first 5 years of life, we explored the relation between child vitamin and herbal supplement use and the risk of leukaemia in a case-control study. During the period 1997-2002, we enrolled 158 children with DS aged 0-18 years that were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (n = 97) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (n = 61) at participating Children's Oncology Group institutions. We enrolled 173 DS children without leukaemia (controls), selected from the cases' primary care clinic and frequency-matched on age. Data were collected via telephone interviews with mothers of the index child regarding use of multivitamins, zinc, vitamin C, iron and herbal supplements, including age at first use, frequency and duration. Among controls, 57% reported regular multivitamin use (>/=3 times/week for >/=3 months) compared with 48% of ALL cases and 61% of AML cases. We found no evidence of an association between children's regular multivitamin use and ALL or AML (adjusted odds ratios [OR] = 0.94 [95% CI 0.52, 1.70] and 1.90 [0.73, 4.91] respectively).

Therapeutic strategies for targeting BRAF in human cancer.,Reviews on recent clinical trials,Rev Recent Clin Trials,2007-05-01,"Constitutive ERK activation is a common finding in human cancer and is often the result of activating mutations of BRAF and RAS. BRAF missense mutations occur in approximately 8% of human tumors, most frequently in melanoma, papillary thyroid cancer and colon cancer. Mutations in BRAF have been found predominantly in tumors in which RAS is commonly mutated but concurrent mutations of both BRAF and RAS are extremely rare. Though over 40 different kinase domain mutations in BRAF have been identified, a single base-pair substitution in exon 15 at codon 600 (V600E) is found in over 80% of cases. These mutations cluster in the glycine-rich loop and activation segments of the kinase and are predicted to induce kinase activation by disrupting the inhibitory glycine-rich loop/activation segment interaction which characterizes the inactive conformation. The majority of mutations identified cause constitutive kinase activation with the V600E mutation demonstrating approximately 500-fold greater kinase activity than wild-type BRAF. Supporting its classification as an oncogene, V600E BRAF stimulates ERK signaling, induces proliferation and is capable in model systems of promoting transformation. However, BRAF mutations are common in nevi and colon polyps suggesting that BRAF mutation alone is insufficient for tumorigenesis and additional mutations are required for cancer development. Though such data suggest that BRAF mutation is likely an early initiating event in tumors such as melanoma and colon cancer, preclinical studies suggest that tumors with V600E BRAF mutation remain dependent upon BRAF for proliferation and survival. Given its frequent occurrence in human cancer and the continued requirement for BRAF activity in tumors with BRAF mutation, efforts are underway to develop targeted inhibitors of BRAF and its downstream effectors. The first generation of RAF inhibitors, including sorafenib, were notable for their lack of specificity and potency for RAF and these agents have shown limited efficacy in tumors with a high incidence of BRAF mutation such as melanoma. Novel inhibitors of the pathway with greater selectivity for BRAF and MEK are now in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials with promising early results. To maximize the likelihood of success with these agents, clinical trials enriched with patients whose tumors possess BRAF and RAS mutations have been proposed.",Journal Article,4648.0,32.0,Constitutive ERK activation is a common finding in human cancer and is often the result of activating mutations of BRAF and RAS BRAF missense mutations occur in approximately 8 of human tumors most frequently in papillary cancer and cancer Mutations in BRAF have been found predominantly in tumors in which RAS is commonly mutated but concurrent mutations of both BRAF and RAS are extremely rare Though over 40 different kinase domain mutations in BRAF have been identified a single base-pair substitution in exon 15 at codon 600 V600E is found in over 80 of cases These mutations cluster in the glycine-rich loop and activation segments of the kinase and are predicted to induce kinase activation by disrupting the inhibitory glycine-rich loop/activation segment interaction which characterizes the inactive conformation The majority of mutations identified cause constitutive kinase activation with the V600E mutation demonstrating approximately 500-fold greater kinase activity than wild-type BRAF Supporting its classification as an oncogene V600E BRAF stimulates ERK signaling induces proliferation and is capable in model systems of promoting transformation However BRAF mutations are common in nevi and polyps suggesting that BRAF mutation alone is insufficient for tumorigenesis and additional mutations are required for cancer development Though such data suggest that BRAF mutation is likely an early initiating event in tumors such as and cancer preclinical studies suggest that tumors with V600E BRAF mutation remain dependent upon BRAF for proliferation and survival Given its frequent occurrence in human cancer and the continued requirement for BRAF activity in tumors with BRAF mutation efforts are underway to develop targeted inhibitors of BRAF and its downstream effectors The first generation of RAF inhibitors including sorafenib were notable for their lack of specificity and potency for RAF and these agents have shown limited efficacy in tumors with a high incidence of BRAF mutation such as Novel inhibitors of the pathway with greater selectivity for BRAF and MEK are now in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials with promising early results To maximize the likelihood of success with these agents clinical trials enriched with patients whose tumors possess BRAF and RAS mutations have been proposed,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[3178, 1819, 363, 16, 8, 186, 1567, 4, 171, 12, 2, 16, 629, 3, 757, 1, 1616, 138, 1, 566, 2, 1102, 566, 4007, 138, 1271, 4, 705, 66, 1, 171, 57, 96, 746, 4, 1796, 12, 2, 12, 138, 4, 566, 47, 85, 204, 2117, 4, 57, 4, 92, 1102, 16, 841, 1185, 84, 750, 138, 1, 110, 566, 2, 1102, 32, 2938, 622, 2471, 252, 327, 338, 216, 1398, 138, 4, 566, 47, 85, 108, 8, 226, 1782, 4767, 5029, 4, 1725, 167, 28, 3673, 2383, 2047, 16, 204, 4, 252, 493, 1, 140, 46, 138, 3132, 4, 3, 12280, 3697, 4432, 2, 363, 5138, 1, 3, 216, 2, 32, 783, 6, 1290, 216, 363, 20, 6242, 3, 1810, 12280, 3697, 4432, 363, 4610, 915, 92, 9239, 3, 5002, 7788, 3, 686, 1, 138, 108, 708, 3178, 216, 363, 5, 3, 2047, 258, 2219, 705, 1666, 1116, 378, 216, 128, 76, 955, 267, 566, 1912, 211, 947, 22, 35, 1836, 2047, 566, 6200, 1819, 314, 1516, 457, 2, 16, 2787, 4, 202, 1530, 1, 2388, 1392, 137, 566, 138, 32, 186, 4, 5791, 2, 3742, 802, 17, 566, 258, 279, 16, 3027, 9, 1565, 2, 402, 138, 32, 616, 9, 12, 193, 2471, 225, 74, 309, 17, 566, 258, 16, 322, 35, 191, 2637, 774, 4, 57, 225, 22, 2, 12, 693, 94, 309, 17, 57, 5, 2047, 566, 258, 918, 470, 1548, 566, 9, 457, 2, 25, 447, 211, 908, 2291, 4, 171, 12, 2, 3, 1351, 4701, 9, 566, 128, 4, 57, 5, 566, 258, 1413, 32, 3948, 6, 690, 238, 222, 1, 566, 2, 211, 1489, 4926, 3, 157, 914, 1, 2212, 222, 141, 1034, 11, 4090, 9, 136, 926, 1, 1121, 2, 3593, 9, 2212, 2, 46, 183, 47, 443, 383, 209, 4, 57, 5, 8, 64, 287, 1, 566, 258, 225, 22, 229, 222, 1, 3, 308, 5, 378, 6072, 9, 566, 2, 1693, 32, 1134, 4, 124, 14, 2, 18, 38, 143, 5, 721, 191, 99, 6, 4116, 3, 1420, 1, 1825, 5, 46, 183, 38, 143, 2220, 5, 7, 1310, 57, 5766, 566, 2, 1102, 138, 47, 85, 1587]",2317.0,18473997,500

Histopathologic characterization of radioactive iodine-refractory fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography-positive thyroid carcinoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2008-07-01,"Radioactive iodine-refractory (RAIR) 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) positive thyroid carcinomas represent the major cause of deaths from thyroid carcinomas (TC) and are therefore the main focus of novel target therapies. However, to the authors' knowledge, the histology of FDG-PET-positive RAIR metastatic thyroid carcinoma has not been described to date. Metastatic tissue from RAIR PET-positive patients identified between 1996 and 2003 at the study institution were selected for histologic examination. The biopsied metastatic site corresponded to a FDG-PET positive lesion sampled within 2 years (87% of which were sampled within 1 year) of the PET scan. Detailed microscopic examination was performed on the metastatic deposit and the available primary tumors. Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas (PDTC) were defined on the basis of high mitotic activity (> or =5 mitoses/10 high-power fields) and/or tumor necrosis. Other types of carcinomas were defined by conventional criteria. The histology of the metastases and primary were analyzed, with disease-specific survival (DSS) as the endpoint. A total of 70 patients satisfied the selection criteria, 43 of whom had primary tumors available for review. Histologic characterization of the metastasis/recurrence in 70 patients revealed that 47.1% (n = 33 patients) had PDTC, 20% (n = 14 patients) had the tall cell variant (TCV) of papillary thyroid carcinoma, 22.9% (n = 16 patients) had well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma (WDPTC), 8.6% (n = 6 patients) had Hurthle cell carcinoma (HCC), and 1.4% (n = 1 patient) had anaplastic carcinomas. The histopathologic distribution of the tumor in the primaries was: PDTC, 51%; TCV, 19%; WDPTC, 23%; and widely invasive HCC, 7%. A differing histology between the primary tumor and metastasis was observed in 37% of cases (n = 16 patients). In the majority of instances (63%; 10 of 16 patients) this was noted as transformation to a higher grade. Of the primary tumors classified as PTC, 70% progressed to more aggressive histotypes in the metastasis. Tumor necrosis and extensive extrathyroid extension in the primary tumor were found to be independent predictors of poorer DSS in this group of patients (P = .015). Approximately 68% of the PDTC primary tumors were initially classified by the primary pathologist as better-differentiated tumors on the basis of the presence of papillary and/or follicular architecture or the presence of typical PTC nuclear features. Several observations can be made based on the results of the current study. The majority of metastases in patients with RAIR PET-positive metastases are of a histologically aggressive subtype. However, well-differentiated RAIR metastatic disease is observable. Poorly differentiated disease is underrecognized in many cases if defined by architectural and nuclear features alone. The presence of tumor necrosis was found to be a strong predictor of aggressive behavior, even within this group of clinically aggressive tumors.

The harmonic scalpel technique without supplementary ligation in total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection: a prospective randomized study.,Annals of surgery,Ann.

Recently, the HS has been used as an alternative to conventional hand-tied ligation for hemostasis in thyroid surgery, which is a time-consuming procedure. Limited data have been published on the evidence of its safety in total thyroidectomy accompanied by CND without supplementary hand-tied ligation. Sixty-five consecutive thyroidectomized patients were enrolled in this study. The final pathology in all the patients was thyroid papillary carcinoma. All patients underwent total thyroidectomy with CND. The NT technique using HS group consisted of 31 patients. The conventional hand-tied ligation technique group comprised 34 patients. The following variables were examined: operating time, intraoperative bleeding, incidence of perioperative complications (hemorrhage, hematoma, seroma, recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, hypoparathyroidism, and injury to the adjacent structures including the trachea and esophagus), the number of pathologically proven lymph nodes, total amount of drainage, duration of drain placement, and time of hospital discharge. The use of the HS reduced the operating time of total thyroidectomy with CND by an average of 43.12 minutes (P < 0.001). The number of pathologically proven lymph nodes was 7.32 +/- 1.66 in the NT group and 6.85 +/- 1.76 in the CT group (P = 0.274). No significant difference was observed in the overall perioperative complications, such as postoperative bleeding, temporary recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, and temporary hypoparathyroidism, between the 2 groups.

Eligible patients with metastatic, iodine-refractory thyroid carcinoma received sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily. Responses were measured radiographically every 2 to 3 months. The study end points included response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and best response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Thirty patients were entered onto the study and treated for a minimum of 16 weeks. Seven patients (23%; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.42) had a partial response lasting 18+ to 84 weeks. Sixteen patients (53%; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.72) had stable disease lasting 14 to 89+ weeks. Seventeen (95%) of 19 patients for whom serial thyroglobulin levels were available showed a marked and rapid response in thyroglobulin levels with a mean decrease of 70%. The median PFS was 79 weeks. Toxicity was consistent with other sorafenib trials, although a single patient died of liver failure that was likely treatment related. Sorafenib has clinically relevant antitumor activity in patients with metastatic, iodine-refractory thyroid carcinoma, with an overall clinical benefit rate (partial response + stable disease) of 77%, median PFS of 79 weeks, and an overall acceptable safety profile.

This multi-institutional study assessed the activity and safety of axitinib, an oral, potent, and selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) 1, 2, and 3 in patients with advanced thyroid cancer. Patients with thyroid cancer of any histology that was resistant or not appropriate for (131)I were enrolled onto a single-arm phase II trial to receive axitinib orally (starting dose, 5 mg twice daily). Objective response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors was the primary end point. Secondary end points included duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, safety, and modulation of soluble (s) VEGFR. Sixty patients were enrolled. Partial responses were observed in 18 patients, yielding an ORR of 30% (95% CI, 18.9 to 43.2). Stable disease lasting > or = 16 weeks was reported in another 23 patients (38%). responses were noted in all histologic subtypes. Median PFS was 18.1 months (95% CI, 12.1 to not estimable).

ATP modulates PTEN subcellular localization in multiple cancer cell lines.,Human molecular genetics,Hum. Mol. Genet.,2008-06-25,"The tumour suppressor gene PTEN plays an important somatic role in both hereditary and sporadic breast carcinogenesis. While the role of PTEN's lipid phosphatase activity, as a negative regulator of the cytoplasmic phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt pathway is well known, it is now well established that PTEN exists and functions in the nucleus. Multiple mechanisms of regulating PTEN's subcellular localization have been reported. However none are ubiquitous across multiple cancer cell lines and tissue types. We show here that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) regulates PTEN subcellular localization in a variety of different cancer cell lines, including those derived from breast, colon and thyroid carcinomas. Cells deficient in ATP show an increased level of nuclear PTEN protein. This increase in PTEN is reversed when cells are supplemented with ATP, ADP or AMP. In contrast, the addition of the non-hydrolyzable analogue ATPgammaS, did not reverse nuclear PTEN protein levels in all the cell types tested.

In her second decade, a hamartomatous soft tissue extremity mass and diffuse gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyposis with pathologic features suggestive of either juvenile, Peutz-Jeghers, or Cowden polyps were identified, along with diffuse esophageal glycogenic acanthosis and skin manifestations. During regular thyroid cancer surveillance under the provisional diagnosis of Cowden syndrome, papillary thyroid carcinoma and benign follicular nodules were diagnosed at age 23. PTEN mutational analysis revealed a novel germline nonsense point mutation of Q219X. Loss of PTEN heterozygosity was also present in the ovarian dysgerminoma. Parental mutation testing and phenotype screening were negative. The correct classification of Cowden syndrome is difficult because of its protean manifestations and overlapping phenotypes with other genetic and noninherited pathologies, particularly regarding various gastrointestinal polyposis syndromes. Despite the challenges, correct classification is critical to patient care because of the associated cancer predispositions and necessary surveillance programs.

Motesanib diphosphate (AMG 706) is a novel oral inhibitor of VEGF receptors, platelet-derived growth-factor receptor, and KIT. In an open-label, single-group, phase 2 study, we treated 93 patients who had progressive, locally advanced or metastatic, radioiodine-resistant differentiated thyroid cancer with 125 mg of motesanib diphosphate, administered orally once daily. The primary end point was an objective response as assessed by an independent radiographic review. Additional end points included the duration of the response, progression-free survival, safety, and changes in serum thyroglobulin concentration. Of the 93 patients, 57 (61%) had papillary thyroid carcinoma. The objective response rate was 14%. Stable disease was achieved in 67% of the patients, and stable disease was maintained for 24 weeks or longer in 35%; 8% had progressive disease as the best response. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median duration of the response was 32 weeks (the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval [CI] was 24; the upper limit could not be estimated because of an insufficient number of events); the estimate of median progression-free survival was 40 weeks (95% CI, 32 to 50). Among the 75 patients in whom thyroglobulin analysis was performed, 81% had decreased serum thyroglobulin concentrations during treatment, as compared with baseline levels. The most common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea (in 59% of the patients), hypertension (56%), fatigue (46%), and weight loss (40%).

Therapeutic strategies for inhibiting oncogenic BRAF signaling.,Current opinion in pharmacology,Curr Opin Pharmacol,2008-08-03,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation is a common property of human cancers and is often due to activating mutations in the BRAF and RAS genes. BRAF kinase domain mutations, the vast majority of which are V600E, occur in approximately 8% of human tumors. These mutations are non-overlapping in distribution with RAS mutations and are observed most frequently in melanoma but also in tumors arising in the colon, thyroid, lung and other sites. V600E BRAF mutation stimulates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling, induces proliferation and is capable of promoting transformation. Given the frequent occurrence of BRAF mutations in human cancer and the continued requirement for BRAF activity in tumors in which it is mutated, efforts are underway to develop targeted inhibitors of BRAF and its downstream effectors.

The first patient had a remote history of MTC and initial presentation of the recurrence was a rapidly progressing cutaneous lesion; on subsequent disease staging, widely metastatic disease was discovered. The other three patients developed cutaneous metastases in the presence of known distant metastases, indicating systemic spread of thyroid cancer. Definitive diagnosis of cutaneous metastases of MTC was made on biopsy of the lesions with cells that stained positive for neuroendocrine markers. Accurate diagnosis of cutaneous metastasis from MTC is important because it is a negative prognostic factor indicative of multisystemic disease. Thus, MTC metastases should be included in the differential diagnosis of erythematous maculopapular eruptions and nodular lesions of the skin, especially when these metastases occur in the upper part of the body and if the patient has a history of MTC.

We reviewed our institution's outcomes in patients treated with EBRT for advanced or recurrent nonanaplastic thyroid cancer. Between April 1989 and April 2006, 76 patients with nonanaplastic thyroid cancer were treated with EBRT. The median follow-up for the surviving patients was 35.3 months (range, 4.2-178.4). The lesions were primarily advanced and included Stage T2 in 5 (7%), T3 in 5 (7%), and T4 in 64 (84%) patients. Stage N1 disease was present in 60 patients (79%). Distant metastases before EBRT were identified in 27 patients (36%). The median total EBRT dose delivered was 6,300 cGy. The histologic features examined included medullary in 12 patients (16%) and nonmedullary in 64 (84%). Of the 76 patients, 71 (93%) had undergone surgery before RT, and radioactive iodine treatment was used in 56 patients (74%). The 2- and 4-year overall locoregional control rate for all histologic types was 86% and 72%, respectively, and the 2- and 4-year overall survival rate for all patients was 74% and 55%, respectively.

Germline mutations and variants in the succinate dehydrogenase genes in Cowden and Cowden-like syndromes.,American journal of human genetics,Am. J. Hum. Genet.,2008-08-01,"Individuals with PTEN mutations have Cowden syndrome (CS), associated with breast, thyroid, and endometrial neoplasias. Many more patients with features of CS, not meeting diagnostic criteria (termed CS-like), are evaluated by clinicians for CS-related cancer risk. Germline mutations in succinate dehydrogenase subunits SDHB-D cause pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma syndrome. One to five percent of SDHB/SDHD mutation carriers have renal cell or papillary thyroid carcinomas, which are also CS-related features. SDHB-D may be candidate susceptibility genes for some PTEN mutation-negative individuals with CS-like cancers. To address this hypothesis, germline SDHB-D mutation analysis in 375 PTEN mutation-negative CS/CS-like individuals was performed, followed by functional analysis of identified SDH mutations/variants. Of 375 PTEN mutation-negative CS/CS-like individuals, 74 (20%) had increased manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) expression, a manifestation of mitochondrial dysfunction. Among these, 10 (13.5%) had germline mutations/variants in SDHB (n = 3) or SDHD (7), not found in 700 controls (p < 0.001). Compared to PTEN mutation-positive CS/CS-like individuals, those with SDH mutations/variants were enriched for carcinomas of the female breast (6/9 SDH versus 30/107 PTEN, p < 0.001), thyroid (5/10 versus 15/106, p < 0.001), and kidney (2/10 versus 4/230, p = 0.026). In the absence of PTEN alteration, CS/CS-like-related SDH mutations/variants show increased phosphorylation of AKT and/or MAPK, downstream manifestations of PTEN dysfunction. Germline SDH mutations/variants occur in a subset of PTEN mutation-negative CS/CS-like individuals and are associated with increased frequencies of breast, thyroid, and renal cancers beyond those conferred by germline PTEN mutations.

Fatty acid synthase and AKT pathway signaling in a subset of papillary thyroid cancers.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2008-08-05,"Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in de novo synthesis of fatty acids. FASN is overexpressed in variety of human cancers, but its role has not been elucidated in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Our objective was to investigate the role of FASN and its relationship with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT activation in a large series of PTC in a tissue microarray format followed by studies using PTC cell lines and Nude mice. Analysis of apoptosis and cell cycle were evaluated by flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation assays. FASN and phospho-AKT protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Our data show that expression of FASN is associated with activated AKT (phospho-AKT) in a subset of PTC. Treatment of PTC cell lines (NPA-187, ONCO-DG-1, and B-CPAP) with C-75, an inhibitor of FASN, suppresses growth and induces apoptosis in all cell lines. Treatment of PTC cells with C-75 or expression of FASN small interfering RNA causes down-regulation of FASN and inactivation of AKT activity. Furthermore, treatment of PTC cell lines with C-75 results in apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway involving the proapoptotic factor Bad, activation of Bax, activation of caspases, and down-regulation of antiapoptotic proteins.

Oncolytic vaccinia virotherapy of anaplastic thyroid cancer in vivo.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2008-08-12,"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a fatal disease with a median survival of only 6 months. Novel therapies are needed to improve dismal outcomes. A mutated, replication-competent, vaccinia virus (GLV-1h68) has oncolytic effects on human ATC cell lines in vitro. We assessed the utility of GLV-1h68 in treating anaplastic thyroid cancer in vivo. Athymic nude mice with xenograft flank tumors of human ATCs (8505C and DRO90-1) were treated with a single intratumoral injection of GLV-1h68 at low dose (5x10(5) plaque-forming unit), high dose (5x10(6) plaque-forming unit), or PBS. Virus-mediated marker gene expression (luciferase, green fluorescent protein, and beta-galactosidase), viral biodistribution, and flank tumor volumes were measured. Luciferase expression was detected 2 d after injection. Continuous viral replication within tumors was reflected by increasing luciferase activity to d 9. At d 10, tumor viral recovery was increased more than 50-fold as compared with the injected dose, and minimal virus was recovered from the lung, liver, brain, heart, spleen, and kidneys. High-dose virus directly injected into normal tissues was undetectable at d 10. The mean volume of control 8505C tumors increased 50.8-fold by d 45, in contrast to 10.5-fold (low dose) and 2.1-fold (high dose; P=0.028) increases for treated tumors. DRO90-1 tumors also showed significant growth inhibition by high-dose virus. No virus-related toxicity was observed throughout the study. GLV-1h68 efficiently infects, expresses transgenes within, and inhibits the growth of ATC in vivo. These promising findings support future clinical trials for patients with ATC.",Journal Article,4179.0,42.0,Anaplastic carcinoma ATC is a fatal disease with a median survival of only 6 months Novel therapies are needed to improve dismal outcomes A mutated replication-competent vaccinia virus GLV-1h68 has oncolytic effects on human ATC cell lines in vitro We assessed the utility of GLV-1h68 in treating anaplastic cancer in vivo Athymic nude mice with xenograft flank tumors of human ATCs 8505C and DRO90-1 were treated with a single intratumoral injection of GLV-1h68 at low dose 5x10 5 plaque-forming unit high dose 5x10 6 plaque-forming unit or PBS Virus-mediated marker gene expression luciferase green fluorescent protein and beta-galactosidase viral biodistribution and flank tumor volumes were measured Luciferase expression was detected 2 d after injection Continuous viral replication within tumors was reflected by increasing luciferase activity to d 9 At d 10 tumor viral recovery was increased more than 50-fold as compared with the injected dose and minimal virus was recovered from the brain spleen and kidneys High-dose virus directly injected into normal tissues was undetectable at d 10 The mean volume of control 8505C tumors increased 50.8-fold by d 45 in contrast to 10.5-fold low dose and 2.1-fold high dose P=0.028 increases for treated tumors DRO90-1 tumors also showed significant growth inhibition by high-dose virus No virus-related toxicity was observed throughout the study GLV-1h68 efficiently infects expresses transgenes within and inhibits the growth of ATC in vivo These promising findings support future clinical trials for patients with ATC,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,"[1841, 134, 3871, 16, 8, 3034, 34, 5, 8, 52, 25, 1, 158, 49, 53, 229, 235, 32, 575, 6, 401, 3929, 123, 8, 1185, 2079, 6299, 9731, 1450, 12913, 12914, 71, 3236, 176, 23, 171, 3871, 31, 285, 4, 439, 21, 275, 3, 1207, 1, 12913, 12914, 4, 1367, 1841, 12, 4, 386, 6396, 2598, 399, 5, 1330, 5564, 57, 1, 171, 23640, 23697, 2, 26328, 14, 11, 73, 5, 8, 226, 2074, 1754, 1, 12913, 12914, 28, 154, 61, 24632, 33, 8506, 4525, 2712, 64, 61, 24632, 49, 8506, 4525, 2712, 15, 7054, 1450, 517, 952, 145, 55, 3864, 4658, 2910, 178, 2, 1090, 14735, 1667, 5250, 2, 5564, 30, 2225, 11, 644, 3864, 55, 10, 530, 18, 427, 50, 1754, 1314, 1667, 2079, 262, 57, 10, 4686, 20, 602, 3864, 128, 6, 427, 83, 28, 427, 79, 30, 1667, 1602, 10, 101, 80, 76, 212, 1116, 22, 72, 5, 3, 2651, 61, 2, 1048, 1450, 10, 5784, 29, 3, 342, 4071, 2, 7143, 64, 61, 1450, 1606, 2651, 237, 295, 742, 10, 3920, 28, 427, 79, 3, 313, 433, 1, 182, 23697, 57, 101, 212, 66, 1116, 20, 427, 512, 4, 748, 6, 79, 33, 1116, 154, 61, 2, 18, 14, 1116, 64, 61, 19, 13, 4836, 1106, 9, 73, 57, 26328, 14, 57, 120, 224, 93, 129, 297, 20, 64, 61, 1450, 77, 1450, 139, 155, 10, 164, 2432, 3, 45, 12913, 12914, 4143, 17265, 8293, 17280, 262, 2, 1576, 3, 129, 1, 3871, 4, 386, 46, 721, 272, 538, 508, 38, 143, 9, 7, 5, 3871]",1569.0,18697871,34

Cancer,2008-09-15,"RET testing in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 for molecular diagnosis is the paradigm for the practice of clinical cancer genetics. However, precise data for distinct mutation-based risk profiles are not available. Here, we survey the clinical profile for one specific genotype as a model, TGC to TGG in codon 634 (C634W). By international efforts, we ascertained all available carriers of the RET C634W mutation. Age at diagnosis, penetrance, and clinical complications were analyzed for medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism (HPT), as well as overall survival. Our series comprises 92 carriers from 20 unrelated families worldwide. Sixty-eight subjects had MTC diagnosed at age 3-72 years (mean 29). Lymph node metastases were observed in 16 subjects aged 20-72 and distant metastases in 4 subjects aged 28-69. Forty-one subjects had pheochromocytoma detected at age 18-67 (mean 36). Amongst the 28 subjects with MTC and pheochromocytoma, six developed pheochromocytoma before MTC. Six subjects had HPT diagnosed at age 26-52 (mean 39). Eighteen subjects died; of the 16 with known causes of death, 8 died of pheochromocytoma and 4 of MTC. Penetrance for MTC is 52% by age 30 and 83% by age 50, for pheochromocytoma penetrance is 20% by age 30 and 67% by age 50, and for HPT penetrance is 3% by age 30 and 21% by age 50.

J. Clin. Oncol.,2008-10-01,"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is associated with a high rate of local recurrence and poor prognosis. This analysis examines the effects of surgery and radiotherapy on survival. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database from 1983 to 2002 with > or = 1-month survival after diagnosis who either had surgery performed or recommended were included in the analysis. Two hundred sixty-one patients met the inclusion criteria for analysis. Median survival was 4 months. Distant or metastatic disease, tumor size >7 cm, and treatment with surgery plus or minus radiotherapy were statistically significant as prognostic for survival on multivariate analysis (P < 0.05).

We studied 89 consecutive patients with lung adenocarcinomas treated by surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital between 1997 and 1999 and performed immunohistochemical analysis for TTF-1 expression and fluorescence in situ hybridization for TTF-1 amplification. We investigated associations between clinical-pathological characteristics, TTF-1 expression, TTF-1 amplification and overall survival. TTF-1 expression was categorized as high (48%), low (24%) or absent (28%). TTF-1 was amplified in 7% of cases. Patients with adenocarcinomas with low or high TTF-1 expression had a significantly better outcome than those with absent TTF-1 expression (median overall survival times of 72.4, 77.8 and 30.5 months, respectively, P = 0.002). In contrast, patients with adenocarcinomas with TTF-1 expression had a worse outcome if TTF-1 was amplified (median overall survival time 39.5 versus 87.5 months). In multivariate analysis, improved overall survival was independently predicted by TTF-1 expression in combination with no TTF-1 amplification (P < 0.001).

Thyroid transcription factor 1 is an independent prognostic factor for patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2008-12-08,"Thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of multiple genes involved in lung development. It is preferentially expressed in adenocarcinomas of the lung and has been investigated as a potential prognostic parameter in patients with lung cancer, with conflicting results. We quantitatively assessed TTF1 protein expression in two large and independent data sets to investigate the impact of TTF1 nuclear expression on patient survival. Automated quantitative analysis, a fluorescent-based method for analysis of in situ protein expression, was used to assess a series of cell lines to find the threshold of detection of TTF1 expression. Then two independent cohorts (176 and 237 cases, respectively) were measured by the same technique, and TTF1 expression was correlated with survival. Tumors expressed TTF1 in 45% and 58% of the cases in each cohort. TTF1 was consistently expressed in adenocarcinomas (n = 61 and 73; Spearman rho = 0.313 and 0.4 for the first and second set, respectively; P < .0001) independent of their differentiation and stage. Survival analysis showed that patients with stage I adenocarcinoma with TTF1 expression had a longer median overall survival than those without expression (n = 43, 44.3 v 26.2 months, P = .05 for the first cohort; n = 87; 49.7 v 38.5 months, P = .03 for the second cohort) Multivariate analysis revealed an independent lower risk of death for patients with stage I adenocarcinoma with TTF1-expressing tumors (hazard ratio = 0.479, 95% CI, 0.235 to 0.977; P = .043).

Loss of Rap1GAP in papillary thyroid cancer.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2008-12-09,"Rap1 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) regulates the activity of Rap1, a putative oncogene. We previously reported Rap1GAP was highly expressed in normal human thyroid cells and decreased in five papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs). To confirm the significance of these findings, we analyzed Rap1GAP expression in a larger set of benign tumors (adenomas and hyperplastic nodules) and PTCs. We determined whether the presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation or allelic loss of Rap1GAP related to changes in Rap1GAP protein expression. To determine the consequences of Rap1GAP loss, we targeted Rap1GAP in culture using small interfering RNA. A highly specific Rap1GAP antibody was applied to sections of 55 human thyroid tissues. Genomic DNA was analyzed for the presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation, and loss of Rap1GAP. Rap1GAP expression in rat thyroid cells was abolished using small interfering RNA. We observed that down-regulation of Rap1GAP in benign lesions and PTCs was common. Rap1GAP expression was more severely decreased in PTCs. Loss of Rap1GAP expression was observed in multiple histological variants of PTCs. Approximately 20% of PTCs and adenomas exhibited allelic loss of Rap1GAP. Loss of Rap1GAP was not associated with the presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation. In vitro, loss of Rap1GAP was sufficient to increase Rap1 activity in thyroid cells. These data indicate that loss of Rap1GAP is a frequent event in PTC. The more frequent and greater down-regulation of Rap1GAP in PTCs compared with adenomas suggests a role for Rap1GAP depletion in the progression of human thyroid tumors, possibly through unrestrained Rap activity.",Journal Article,4060.0,,Rap1 GTPase-activating protein GAP regulates the activity of Rap1 a putative oncogene We previously reported Rap1GAP was highly expressed in normal human cells and decreased in five papillary carcinomas PTCs To confirm the significance of these findings we analyzed Rap1GAP expression in a larger set of benign tumors adenomas and hyperplastic nodules and PTCs We determined whether the presence of the BRAF V600E mutation or allelic loss of Rap1GAP related to changes in Rap1GAP protein expression To determine the consequences of Rap1GAP loss we targeted Rap1GAP in culture using small interfering RNA A highly specific Rap1GAP antibody was applied to sections of 55 human tissues Genomic DNA was analyzed for the presence of the BRAF V600E mutation and loss of Rap1GAP Rap1GAP expression in rat cells was abolished using small interfering RNA We observed that down-regulation of Rap1GAP in benign lesions and PTCs was common Rap1GAP expression was more severely decreased in PTCs Loss of Rap1GAP expression was observed in multiple histological variants of PTCs Approximately 20 of PTCs and adenomas exhibited allelic loss of Rap1GAP Loss of Rap1GAP was not associated with the presence of the BRAF V600E mutation In vitro loss of Rap1GAP was sufficient to increase Rap1 activity in cells These data indicate that loss of Rap1GAP is a frequent event in PTC The more frequent and greater down-regulation of Rap1GAP in PTCs compared with adenomas suggests a role for Rap1GAP depletion in the progression of human tumors possibly through unrestrained Rap activity,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[14946, 9189, 1616, 178, 5285, 2468, 3, 128, 1, 14946, 8, 2743, 1836, 21, 373, 210, 9526, 10, 561, 570, 4, 295, 171, 37, 2, 340, 4, 365, 1796, 826, 17815, 6, 1843, 3, 724, 1, 46, 272, 21, 311, 9526, 55, 4, 8, 1077, 916, 1, 1002, 57, 2751, 2, 8179, 2597, 2, 17815, 21, 509, 317, 3, 463, 1, 3, 566, 2047, 258, 15, 3861, 407, 1, 9526, 139, 6, 400, 4, 9526, 178, 55, 6, 223, 3, 3255, 1, 9526, 407, 21, 238, 9526, 4, 2099, 75, 302, 3449, 893, 8, 561, 112, 9526, 548, 10, 1498, 6, 3013, 1, 614, 171, 742, 572, 261, 10, 311, 9, 3, 463, 1, 3, 566, 2047, 258, 2, 407, 1, 9526, 9526, 55, 4, 4008, 37, 10, 6020, 75, 302, 3449, 893, 21, 164, 17, 1328, 863, 1, 9526, 4, 1002, 406, 2, 17815, 10, 186, 9526, 55, 10, 80, 7207, 340, 4, 17815, 407, 1, 9526, 55, 10, 164, 4, 232, 1831, 839, 1, 17815, 705, 179, 1, 17815, 2, 2751, 1416, 3861, 407, 1, 9526, 407, 1, 9526, 10, 44, 41, 5, 3, 463, 1, 3, 566, 2047, 258, 4, 439, 407, 1, 9526, 10, 1952, 6, 344, 14946, 128, 4, 37, 46, 74, 1008, 17, 407, 1, 9526, 16, 8, 908, 774, 4, 3748, 3, 80, 908, 2, 378, 1328, 863, 1, 9526, 4, 17815, 72, 5, 2751, 844, 8, 200, 9, 9526, 2286, 4, 3, 91, 1, 171, 57, 2150, 298, 30886, 16272, 128]",1563.0,19066305,205

Postoperative external beam radiotherapy for differentiated thyroid cancer: outcomes and morbidity with conformal treatment.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2008-12-25,"To review institutional outcomes for patients treated for differentiated thyroid cancer with postoperative conformal external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). This is a single-institution retrospective review of 131 consecutive patients with differentiated thyroid cancer who underwent EBRT between January 1996 and December 2005. Histologic diagnoses included 104 papillary, 21 follicular, and six mixed papillary-follicular types. American Joint Committee on Cancer stage distribution was Stage III in 2 patients, Stage IVa-IVc in 128, and not assessable in 1. Thirty-four patients (26%) had high-risk histologic types and 76 (58%) had recurrent disease. Extraglandular disease spread was seen in 126 patients (96%), microscopically positive surgical margins were seen in 62 patients (47%), and gross residual disease was seen in 15 patients (11%). Median EBRT dose was 60 Gy (range, 38-72 Gy). Fifty-seven patients (44%) were treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to a median dose of 60 Gy (range, 56-66 Gy). Median follow-up was 38 months (range, 0-134 months). Kaplan-Meier estimates of locoregional relapse-free survival, disease-specific survival, and overall survival at 4 years were 79%, 76%, and 73%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, high-risk histologic features and gross residual disease predicted for inferior locoregional relapse-free survival, whereas high-risk histologic features, M1 disease, and gross residual disease predicted for inferior disease-specific and overall survival. The IMRT did not impact on survival outcomes, but was associated with less frequent severe late morbidity (12% vs. 2%).

Phosphorylated insulin like growth factor-I receptor expression and its clinico-pathological significance in histologic subtypes of human thyroid cancer.,"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood),2009-01-28,"Overexpression of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) is seen in a multitude of human thyroid cancers and correlates with poor prognosis. However, recent studies suggest that low phospho-IGF-IR (pIGF-IR) expression rather than its overexpression may be an indicator of poorly differentiated disease. No previous study has evaluated the expression of pIGF-IR to determine if activation or loss of expression of this receptor is associated with thyroid tumor progression. Accordingly, a quantitative immunohistochemical (IHC) method was used to evaluate the clinico-pathological significance of pIGF-IR expression in archival samples of human thyroid carcinomas. Quantitative analysis of pIGF-IR levels revealed a significant difference in the median index of pIGF-IR between different histological subtypes of thyroid cancer (P < 0.001). Specifically, the median pIGF-IR index of differentiated thyroid cancers was significantly higher than the median index of other poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (P < 0.001). This was further confirmed in individual tumor sections of thyroid carcinoma where anaplastic and differentiated components co-existed. No significant difference was noted in the pIGF-IR index of tumors grouped by size or stage but a trend towards lower mean pIGF-IR index was noted in older patients. Our data indicates that pIGF-IR is upregulated in a majority of follicular thyroid carcinomas, suggesting it may be a potential target for therapy for patients with this disease. In addition, since low pIGF-IR expression was found to correlate with aggressive human thyroid carcinoma, it also suggests that IGF-IR may not be needed for progression of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma possibly because other cell signaling pathways are activated, obviating the need for IGF-IR signaling. However, more mechanistic studies would be necessary to substantiate the possibility that pIGF-IR may be important for differentiation of thyroid tissues and is lost with disease progression.",Journal Article,4010.0,14.0,Overexpression of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor IGF-IR is seen in a multitude of human cancers and correlates with poor prognosis However recent studies suggest that low phospho-IGF-IR pIGF-IR expression rather than its overexpression may be an indicator of poorly differentiated disease No previous study has evaluated the expression of pIGF-IR to determine if activation or loss of expression of this receptor is associated with tumor progression Accordingly a quantitative immunohistochemical IHC method was used to evaluate the clinico-pathological significance of pIGF-IR expression in archival samples of human carcinomas Quantitative analysis of pIGF-IR levels revealed a significant difference in the median index of pIGF-IR between different histological subtypes of cancer P 0.001 Specifically the median pIGF-IR index of differentiated cancers was significantly higher than the median index of other poorly differentiated cancer P 0.001 This was further confirmed in individual tumor sections of carcinoma where anaplastic and differentiated components co-existed No significant difference was noted in the pIGF-IR index of tumors grouped by size or stage but a trend towards lower mean pIGF-IR index was noted in older patients Our data indicates that pIGF-IR is upregulated in a majority of follicular carcinomas suggesting it may be a potential target for therapy for patients with this disease In addition since low pIGF-IR expression was found to correlate with aggressive human carcinoma it also suggests that IGF-IR may not be needed for progression of anaplastic carcinoma possibly because other cell signaling pathways are activated obviating the need for IGF-IR signaling However more mechanistic studies would be necessary to substantiate the possibility that pIGF-IR may be important for differentiation of tissues and is lost with disease progression,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[851, 1, 1601, 733, 129, 161, 70, 153, 1273, 2123, 16, 527, 4, 8, 9540, 1, 171, 163, 2, 1871, 5, 334, 356, 137, 435, 94, 309, 17, 154, 3125, 1273, 2123, 17296, 2123, 55, 1832, 76, 211, 851, 68, 40, 35, 3287, 1, 1240, 1442, 34, 77, 698, 45, 71, 194, 3, 55, 1, 17296, 2123, 6, 223, 492, 363, 15, 407, 1, 55, 1, 26, 153, 16, 41, 5, 30, 91, 4705, 8, 1156, 1382, 1289, 596, 10, 95, 6, 376, 3, 8688, 1301, 724, 1, 17296, 2123, 55, 4, 3967, 347, 1, 171, 826, 1156, 65, 1, 17296, 2123, 148, 553, 8, 93, 523, 4, 3, 52, 558, 1, 17296, 2123, 59, 338, 1831, 814, 1, 12, 19, 13, 144, 1225, 3, 52, 17296, 2123, 558, 1, 1442, 163, 10, 97, 142, 76, 3, 52, 558, 1, 127, 1240, 1442, 12, 19, 13, 144, 26, 10, 195, 557, 4, 797, 30, 3013, 1, 134, 1257, 1841, 2, 1442, 1628, 1269, 6810, 77, 93, 523, 10, 1051, 4, 3, 17296, 2123, 558, 1, 57, 3706, 20, 444, 15, 82, 84, 8, 853, 3113, 280, 313, 17296, 2123, 558, 10, 1051, 4, 434, 7, 114, 74, 2640, 17, 17296, 2123, 16, 2684, 4, 8, 686, 1, 1974, 826, 802, 192, 68, 40, 8, 174, 283, 9, 36, 9, 7, 5, 26, 34, 4, 352, 1192, 154, 17296, 2123, 55, 10, 204, 6, 1513, 5, 571, 171, 134, 192, 120, 844, 17, 1273, 2123, 68, 44, 40, 575, 9, 91, 1, 1841, 134, 2150, 408, 127, 31, 314, 460, 32, 735, 21174, 3, 594, 9, 1273, 2123, 314, 137, 80, 2716, 94, 688, 40, 1493, 6, 16249, 3, 2526, 17, 17296, 2123, 68, 40, 305, 9, 910, 1, 742, 2, 16, 3009, 5, 34, 91]",1882.0,19176870,210
Advances in chemotherapy of differentiated epithelial and medullary thyroid cancers.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2009-03-03,"Systemic chemotherapies for advanced or metastatic thyroid carcinomas have been of only limited effectiveness. For patients with differentiated or medullary carcinomas unresponsive to conventional treatments, novel therapies are needed to improve disease outcomes. The PubMed and Google Scholar search engines were used to identify publications and peer-reviewed meeting presentations addressing chemotherapy and targeted therapy for differentiated or medullary carcinoma. Multiple novel therapies primarily targeting angiogenesis have entered clinical trials for metastatic thyroid carcinoma. Partial response rates up to 30% have been reported in single agent studies, but prolonged disease stabilization is more commonly seen. The most successful agents target the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, with potential targets including the mutant kinases associated with papillary and medullary oncogenesis. Two drugs approved for other malignancies, sorafenib and sunitinib, have had promising preliminary results reported, and are being used selectively for patients who do not qualify for clinical trials.

A phase II trial of fosbretabulin in advanced anaplastic thyroid carcinoma and correlation of baseline serum-soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 with outcome.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2009-03-01,"Fosbretabulin is a novel vascular-disrupting agent that has antitumor activity against anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) cell lines, xenografts, and demonstrable efficacy in a phase I trial. This phase II study determined the efficacy and safety of fosbretabulin in patients with advanced ATC and whether fosbretabulin altered the natural history of ATC by virtue of doubling the median survival. A secondary aim evaluated the prognostic value of serum soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM). Twenty-six patients received fosbretabulin 45 mg/m(2) as a 10-minute intravenous infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. sICAM levels were obtained at baseline, over the first two cycles, and end of therapy. Treatment was continued until disease progression. Fosbretabulin was well tolerated; grade 3 toxicity was observed in nine patients (35%), and grade 4 toxicity in one (4%). QTc prolongation delayed treatment in four causing one to stop treatment. Median survival was 4.7 months with 34% and 23% alive at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Median duration of stable disease in seven patients was 12.3 months (range, 4.4-37.9 months). Baseline serum sICAM levels were measured in 24 patients with a median 253.5 ng/mL. There was a significant difference in event-free survival among tertiles of baseline sICAM levels (p < 0.009). There were no objective responses seen with single-agent fosbretabulin as administered in this trial, and we did not observe a doubling of survival as our primary endpoint. This is among the largest prospective trials ever conducted for ATC. Fosbretabulin has an acceptable safety profile in patients with advanced ATC, and one-third survived more than 6 months. Despite a small sample size, low baseline sICAM levels were predictive of event-free survival. Further prospective validation of sICAM as a therapeutic biomarker and exploring combination regimens with fosbretabulin are warranted.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",3978.0,131.0,Fosbretabulin is a novel vascular-disrupting agent that has antitumor activity against anaplastic cancer ATC cell lines xenografts and demonstrable efficacy in a phase I trial This phase II study determined the efficacy and safety of fosbretabulin in patients with advanced ATC and whether fosbretabulin altered the natural history of ATC by virtue of doubling the median survival A secondary aim evaluated the prognostic value of serum soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 sICAM Twenty-six patients received fosbretabulin 45 mg/m 2 as a 10-minute intravenous infusion on days 1 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle sICAM levels were obtained at baseline over the first two cycles and end of therapy Treatment was continued until disease progression Fosbretabulin was well tolerated grade 3 toxicity was observed in nine patients 35 and grade 4 toxicity in one 4 QTc prolongation delayed treatment in four causing one to stop treatment Median survival was 4.7 months with 34 and 23 alive at 6 and 12 months respectively Median duration of stable disease in seven patients was 12.3 months range 4.4-37.9 months Baseline serum sICAM levels were measured in 24 patients with a median 253.5 ng/mL There was a significant difference in event-free survival among tertiles of baseline sICAM levels p 0.009 There were no objective responses seen with single-agent fosbretabulin as administered in this trial and we did not observe a doubling of survival as our primary endpoint This is among the largest prospective trials ever conducted for ATC Fosbretabulin has an acceptable safety profile in patients with advanced ATC and one-third survived more than 6 months Despite a small sample size low baseline sICAM levels were predictive of event-free survival Further prospective validation of sICAM as a therapeutic biomarker and exploring combination regimens with fosbretabulin are warranted,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[15006, 16, 8, 229, 756, 6242, 420, 17, 71, 579, 128, 480, 1841, 12, 3871, 31, 285, 1348, 2, 11411, 209, 4, 8, 124, 70, 160, 26, 124, 215, 45, 509, 3, 209, 2, 367, 1, 15006, 4, 7, 5, 131, 3871, 2, 317, 15006, 1495, 3, 1504, 532, 1, 3871, 20, 15955, 1, 4342, 3, 52, 25, 8, 568, 1130, 194, 3, 177, 549, 1, 524, 2968, 2087, 2128, 1354, 14, 19844, 737, 437, 7, 103, 15006, 512, 81, 188, 18, 22, 8, 79, 3949, 1262, 904, 23, 162, 14, 66, 2, 167, 1, 8, 339, 218, 417, 19844, 148, 11, 683, 28, 330, 252, 3, 157, 100, 410, 2, 396, 1, 36, 24, 10, 1351, 1100, 34, 91, 15006, 10, 149, 421, 88, 27, 155, 10, 164, 4, 762, 7, 465, 2, 88, 39, 155, 4, 104, 39, 6725, 4464, 1612, 24, 4, 294, 3440, 104, 6, 7142, 24, 52, 25, 10, 39, 67, 53, 5, 562, 2, 382, 1701, 28, 49, 2, 133, 53, 106, 52, 654, 1, 585, 34, 4, 648, 7, 10, 133, 27, 53, 184, 39, 39, 567, 83, 53, 330, 524, 19844, 148, 11, 644, 4, 259, 7, 5, 8, 52, 8105, 33, 997, 542, 125, 10, 8, 93, 523, 4, 774, 115, 25, 107, 10453, 1, 330, 19844, 148, 19, 13, 2376, 125, 11, 77, 461, 253, 527, 5, 226, 420, 15006, 22, 468, 4, 26, 160, 2, 21, 205, 44, 4635, 8, 4342, 1, 25, 22, 114, 86, 1138, 26, 16, 107, 3, 2166, 482, 143, 3353, 426, 9, 3871, 15006, 71, 35, 1595, 367, 800, 4, 7, 5, 131, 3871, 2, 104, 1282, 2996, 80, 76, 49, 53, 550, 8, 302, 1000, 444, 154, 330, 19844, 148, 11, 464, 1, 774, 115, 25, 195, 482, 929, 1, 19844, 22, 8, 189, 901, 2, 4378, 150, 472, 5, 15006, 32, 1197]",1879.0,19265494,693
Novel therapeutic inhibitors of the c-Met signaling pathway in cancer.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2009-03-24,"A wide variety of human malignancies exhibit sustained c-Met stimulation, overexpression, or mutation, including carcinomas of the breast, liver, lung, ovary, kidney, and thyroid. Notably, activating mutations in c-Met have been positively identified in patients with a particular hereditary form of papillary renal cancer, directly implicating c-Met in human tumorigenesis. Aberrant signaling of the c-Met signaling pathway due to dysregulation of the c-Met receptor or overexpression of its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), has been associated with an aggressive phenotype. Extensive evidence that c-Met signaling is involved in the progression and spread of several cancers and an enhanced understanding of its role in disease have generated considerable interest in c-Met and HGF as major targets in cancer drug development. This has led to the development of a variety of c-Met pathway antagonists with potential clinical applications. The three main approaches of pathway-selective anticancer drug development have included antagonism of ligand/receptor interaction, inhibition of the tyrosine kinase catalytic activity, and blockade of the receptor/effector interaction. Several c-Met antagonists are now under clinical investigation. Preliminary clinical results of several of these agents, including both monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, have been encouraging.

Hypothyroidism in older patients with head and neck cancer after treatment with radiation: a population-based study.,Head & neck,Head Neck,2009-08-01,"In patients with head and neck cancer, radiation treatment (RT) is a risk factor for hypothyroidism. However, the specific magnitude of risk after RT in older patients is not known. We identified 5916 patients (age > 65 years) from SEER-Medicare diagnosed with head and neck cancer from 1992 to 2002. Proportional hazards models compared hypothyroidism risk after any RT versus surgery alone. In patients treated with RT, 5-year incidence of hypothyroidism was 20% and 10-year incidence was 59%; in patients treated with surgery alone, incidence was 7% and 39% (p < .001).

Association between hypothyroidism and hepatocellular carcinoma: a case-control study in the United States.,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",Hepatology,2009-05-01,"Thyroid hormones play an essential role in lipid mobilization, lipid degradation, and fatty acid oxidation. Hypothyroidism has been associated with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; however, the association between thyroid diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in men and women has not been well established. We investigated the association between hypothyroidism and HCC risk in men and women in a case-control study, which included 420 eligible patients with HCC and 1104 healthy controls. We used multivariate unconditional logistic regression models to control for the confounding effects of established HCC risk factors. A long-term history of hypothyroidism (>10 years) was associated with a statistically significant high risk of HCC in women; after adjusting for demographic factors, diabetes, hepatitis, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and family history of cancer, the odds ratio (OR) was 2.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-6.3). Restricted analyses among hepatitis virus-negative subjects, nondrinkers, nondiabetics, nonsmokers, and nonobese individuals indicated a significant association between hypothyroidism and HCC, with an approximate two-fold to three-fold increased risk of HCC development. We observed risk modification among women with diabetes mellitus (OR = 9.4; 95% CI = 2.7-32.7) and chronic hepatitis virus infection (OR = 31.2; 95% CI = 6.3-153.2).

The American Thyroid association (ATA) chose to create specific MTC Clinical Guidelines that would bring together and update the diverse MTC literature and combine it with evidence-based medicine and the knowledge and experience of a panel of expert clinicians. Relevant articles were identified using a systematic PubMed search and supplemented with additional published materials.

"Mutational profile of advanced primary and metastatic radioactive iodine-refractory thyroid cancers reveals distinct pathogenetic roles for BRAF, PIK3CA, and AKT1.",Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2009-06-01,"Patients with poorly differentiated thyroid cancers (PDTC), anaplastic thyroid cancers (ATC), and radioactive iodine-refractory (RAIR) differentiated thyroid cancers have a high mortality, particularly if positive on [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET). To obtain comprehensive genetic information on advanced thyroid cancers, we designed an assay panel for mass spectrometry genotyping encompassing the most significant oncogenes in this disease: 111 mutations in RET, BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, KRAS, PIK3CA, AKT1, and other related genes were surveyed in 31 cell lines, 52 primary tumors (34 PDTC and 18 ATC), and 55 RAIR, FDG-PET-positive recurrences and metastases (nodal and distant) from 42 patients. RAS mutations were more prevalent than BRAF (44 versus 12%; P = 0.002) in primary PDTC, whereas BRAF was more common than RAS (39 versus 13%; P = 0.04) in PET-positive metastatic PDTC. BRAF mutations were highly prevalent in ATC (44%) and in metastatic tumors from RAIR PTC patients (95%). Among patients with multiple metastases, 9 of 10 showed between-sample concordance for BRAF or RAS mutations. By contrast, 5 of 6 patients were discordant for mutations of PIK3CA or AKT1. AKT1_G49A was found in 9 specimens, exclusively in metastases. This is the first documentation of AKT1 mutation in thyroid cancer. Thus, RAIR, FDG-PET-positive metastases are enriched for BRAF mutations. If BRAF is mutated in the primary, it is likely that the metastases will harbor the defect. By contrast, absence of PIK3CA/AKT1 mutations in one specimen may not reflect the status at other sites because these mutations arise during progression, an important consideration for therapies directed at phosphoinositide 3-kinase effectors.",Journal Article,3886.0,351.0,Patients with poorly differentiated cancers PDTC anaplastic cancers ATC and radioactive iodine-refractory RAIR differentiated cancers have a high mortality particularly if positive on 18 F fluorodeoxyglucose FDG -positron emission tomography PET To obtain comprehensive genetic information on advanced cancers we designed an assay panel for mass spectrometry genotyping encompassing the most significant oncogenes in this disease 111 mutations in RET BRAF NRAS HRAS KRAS PIK3CA AKT1 and other related genes were surveyed in 31 cell lines 52 primary tumors 34 PDTC and 18 ATC and 55 RAIR FDG-PET-positive recurrences and metastases nodal and distant from 42 patients RAS mutations were more prevalent than BRAF 44 versus 12 P 0.002 in primary PDTC whereas BRAF was more common than RAS 39 versus 13 P 0.04 in PET-positive metastatic PDTC BRAF mutations were highly prevalent in ATC 44 and in metastatic tumors from RAIR PTC patients 95 Among patients with multiple metastases 9 of 10 showed between-sample concordance for BRAF or RAS mutations By contrast 5 of 6 patients were discordant for mutations of PIK3CA or AKT1 AKT1_G49A was found in 9 specimens exclusively in metastases This is the first documentation of AKT1 mutation in cancer Thus RAIR FDG-PET-positive metastases are enriched for BRAF mutations If BRAF is mutated in the primary it is likely that the metastases will harbor the defect By contrast absence of PIK3CA/AKT1 mutations in one specimen may not reflect the status at other sites because these mutations arise during progression an important consideration for therapies directed at phosphoinositide 3-kinase effectors,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[7, 5, 1240, 1442, 163, 13577, 1841, 163, 3871, 2, 4741, 4287, 430, 16923, 1442, 163, 47, 8, 64, 282, 823, 492, 109, 23, 203, 1068, 4085, 1285, 1900, 1799, 872, 495, 6, 3140, 949, 336, 487, 23, 131, 163, 21, 1114, 35, 719, 993, 9, 782, 3680, 2686, 6853, 3, 96, 93, 3326, 4, 26, 34, 3167, 138, 4, 2412, 566, 2845, 7174, 723, 1506, 4958, 2, 127, 139, 214, 11, 3696, 4, 456, 31, 285, 653, 86, 57, 562, 13577, 2, 203, 3871, 2, 614, 16923, 1285, 495, 109, 1593, 2, 196, 779, 2, 626, 29, 595, 7, 1102, 138, 11, 80, 2485, 76, 566, 584, 185, 133, 19, 13, 1111, 4, 86, 13577, 547, 566, 10, 80, 186, 76, 1102, 587, 185, 233, 19, 13, 755, 4, 495, 109, 113, 13577, 566, 138, 11, 561, 2485, 4, 3871, 584, 2, 4, 113, 57, 29, 16923, 3748, 7, 48, 107, 7, 5, 232, 196, 83, 1, 79, 224, 59, 1000, 1827, 9, 566, 15, 1102, 138, 20, 748, 33, 1, 49, 7, 11, 4570, 9, 138, 1, 1506, 15, 4958, 4958, 57938, 10, 204, 4, 83, 623, 4437, 4, 196, 26, 16, 3, 157, 4965, 1, 4958, 258, 4, 12, 631, 16923, 1285, 495, 109, 196, 32, 2220, 9, 566, 138, 492, 566, 16, 1185, 4, 3, 86, 192, 16, 322, 17, 3, 196, 303, 2760, 3, 5398, 20, 748, 1127, 1, 1506, 4958, 138, 4, 104, 2360, 68, 44, 2694, 3, 156, 28, 127, 633, 408, 46, 138, 3043, 190, 91, 35, 305, 2415, 9, 235, 1166, 28, 4497, 27, 216, 4926]",1639.0,19487299,499

We present a case report in conjunction with a retrospective review and evaluation of the English-language literature on Horner syndrome and thyroid pathologic conditions. Horner syndrome is a rare complication of thyroid disease most often occurring in the postoperative setting after resections. Preoperatively, Horner syndrome is usually caused by a benign intrathoracic goiter that compresses the sympathetic plexus as it exits the thoracic cavity to enter the neck. Malignant thyroid disease leading to Horner syndrome is less common than benign causes of the syndrome. Treatment of compressive lesions can lead to resolution of nerve compression. Horner syndrome is a rare complication of thyroid pathologic conditions. When present preoperatively, the majority of cases are due to benign compression of the cervical plexus. Therefore, Horner syndrome in the setting of a goiter does not necessarily portend a malignant process as one might suspect.

"Late effects of conformal radiation therapy for pediatric patients with low-grade glioma: prospective evaluation of cognitive, endocrine, and hearing deficits.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-07-06,"We conducted a prospective trial to evaluate late effects in pediatric patients with low-grade glioma (LGG) treated with conformal radiation therapy (CRT). Between August 1997 and August 2006, 78 pediatric patients with LGG (mean age, 9.7 years; standard deviation, +/-4.4 years) received 54 Gy of CRT with a 10-mm clinical target volume margin. Tumor locations were diencephalon (n = 58), cerebral hemisphere (n = 3), and cerebellum (n = 17). Baseline and serial evaluations were performed to identify deficits in cognition, endocrine function, and hearing. Deficits were correlated with clinical factors and radiation dose within specific normal tissue volumes. Cognitive effects of CRT through 5 years after CRT correlated with patient age, neurofibromatosis type 1 status, tumor location and volume, extent of resection, and radiation dose. The effect of age exceeded that of radiation dose; patients younger than 5 years experienced the greatest decline in cognition. Before CRT, growth hormone (GH) secretion abnormality was diagnosed in 24% of tested patients, and 12% had precocious puberty. The 10-year cumulative incidence of GH replacement was 48.9%; of thyroid hormone replacement, 64.0%; of glucocorticoid replacement, 19.2%; and of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog therapy, 34.2%. The mean +/- standard errors of the cumulative incidence of hearing loss at 10 years did not exceed 5.7% +/- 3.3% at any frequency. To our knowledge, this is the largest series of prospectively followed children with LGG to undergo irradiation. Adverse effects are limited and predictable for most patients; however, this study provides additional evidence that CRT should be delayed for young patients and identifies the potential benefits of reducing radiation dose to normal brain.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",3851.0,213.0,We conducted a prospective trial to evaluate late effects in pediatric patients with low-grade glioma LGG treated with conformal radiation therapy CRT Between August 1997 and August 2006 78 pediatric patients with LGG mean age 9.7 years standard deviation +/-4.4 years received 54 Gy of CRT with a 10-mm clinical target volume margin Tumor locations were diencephalon n 58 cerebral hemisphere n 3 and cerebellum n 17 Baseline and serial evaluations were performed to identify deficits in cognition endocrine function and hearing Deficits were correlated with clinical factors and radiation dose within specific normal tissue volumes Cognitive effects of CRT through 5 years after CRT correlated with patient age neurofibromatosis type 1 status tumor location and volume extent of resection and radiation dose The effect of age exceeded that of radiation dose patients younger than 5 years experienced the greatest decline in cognition Before CRT growth hormone GH secretion abnormality was diagnosed in 24 of tested patients and 12 had precocious puberty The 10-year cumulative incidence of GH replacement was 48.9 of hormone replacement 64.0 of glucocorticoid replacement 19.2 and of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog therapy 34.2 The mean +/- standard errors of the cumulative incidence of hearing loss at 10 years did not exceed 5.7 +/- 3.3 at any frequency To our knowledge this is the largest series of prospectively followed children with LGG to undergo irradiation Adverse effects are limited and predictable for most patients however this study provides additional evidence that CRT should be delayed for young patients and identifies the potential benefits of reducing radiation dose to normal brain,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[21, 426, 8, 482, 160, 6, 376, 807, 176, 4, 815, 7, 5, 154, 88, 945, 5713, 73, 5, 2972, 121, 36, 1089, 59, 2480, 2341, 2, 2480, 1324, 833, 815, 7, 5, 5713, 313, 89, 83, 67, 60, 260, 3348, 39, 39, 60, 103, 667, 381, 1, 1089, 5, 8, 79, 321, 38, 283, 433, 959, 30, 4069, 11, 45615, 78, 717, 3549, 12741, 78, 27, 2, 13002, 78, 269, 330, 2, 2108, 3816, 11, 173, 6, 255, 2752, 4, 8130, 1293, 343, 2, 4396, 2752, 11, 438, 5, 38, 130, 2, 121, 61, 262, 112, 295, 246, 2225, 1863, 176, 1, 1089, 298, 33, 60, 50, 1089, 438, 5, 69, 89, 7427, 267, 14, 156, 30, 1147, 2, 433, 1039, 1, 170, 2, 121, 61, 3, 254, 1, 89, 4726, 17, 1, 121, 61, 7, 773, 76, 33, 60, 592, 3, 2199, 1858, 4, 8130, 348, 1089, 129, 785, 4579, 2935, 3698, 10, 265, 4, 259, 1, 650, 7, 2, 133, 42, 26266, 10302, 3, 79, 111, 967, 287, 1, 4579, 3892, 10, 576, 83, 1, 785, 3892, 660, 13, 1, 5399, 3892, 326, 18, 2, 1, 6501, 5586, 785, 3497, 36, 562, 18, 3, 313, 260, 4612, 1, 3, 967, 287, 1, 4396, 407, 28, 79, 60, 205, 44, 6818, 33, 67, 27, 27, 28, 500, 675, 6, 114, 922, 26, 16, 3, 2166, 988, 1, 1143, 370, 541, 5, 5713, 6, 1251, 1104, 290, 176, 32, 383, 2, 7639, 9, 96, 7, 137, 26, 45, 777, 402, 241, 17, 1089, 257, 40, 1612, 9, 1169, 7, 2, 2953, 3, 174, 1141, 1, 1818, 121, 61, 6, 295, 342]",1712.0,19581535,389

Endoscopic hemithyroidectomy with prophylactic ipsilateral central neck dissection via an unilateral axillo-breast approach without gas insufflation for unilateral micropapillary thyroid carcinoma: preliminary report.,Surgical endoscopy,Surg Endosc,2009-08-18,"Recently, various endoscopic approaches have been applied to thyroid surgery. However, few specific data exist on endoscopic thyroidectomy with central neck dissection (CND) for micropapillary thyroid carcinoma. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of endoscopic hemithyroidectomy (HT) plus CND. In this study, 29 consecutive patients underwent endoscopic HT with ipsilateral CND via a unilateral axillo-breast approach (endo group), and 30 matched control patients underwent conventional open HT with ipsilateral CND (open group). The following variables were compared between these two groups: perioperative complications, surgery-related outcomes, and pathologic outcomes. The operating time in the endo group was longer than in the open group (p = 0.012). In terms of parathyroid gland (PTG) preservation, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. The mean numbers of dissected central lymph nodes and metastatic central lymph nodes were similar in the two groups (p = 0.506 vs. 0.975). The endo group had a significantly longer mean hospital stay (6.21 +/- 0.94 days) than the open group (4.30 +/- 1.02 days; p = 0.000). No significant difference was observed in the overall perioperative complications between the two groups.

Salivary gland side effects commonly develop several weeks after initial radioactive iodine ablation.,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",J. Nucl. Med.,2009-09-16,"Salivary gland side effects (SSEs) can be a source of significant morbidity in thyroid cancer patients receiving radioactive iodine (RAI) for remnant ablation or therapy. However, the incidence, time course, and ultimate resolution of SSEs that develop in the first few months after a single administered activity of RAI for remnant ablation has not be adequately defined. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of patients after RAI remnant ablation (RRA) to determine the incidence of salivary gland-related side effects reported within the first year of RRA, the dose-response relationship between administered activity and specific SSEs, and the incidence of specific SSEs based on the method of preparation for remnant ablation (recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone [rhTSH] vs. traditional thyroid hormone withdrawal [THW]). SSEs were reported within the first year of RAI ablation in 39% of a cohort of 262 patients (66% women, 93% papillary thyroid cancer; median dose, 5,217 MBq [141 mCi]). Persistent side effects were noted after a median of 7 y in 5% or less of the entire cohort. However, when side effects developed in patients during the first year, the incidence of persistence of the symptom at last follow-up ranged from 5% to 13%. A statistically significant dose response was seen between administered activity of RAI and development of salivary gland swelling (P = 0.001, logistic dose-response curve) but not with dry mouth (P = 0.63), altered taste (P = 0.27), or salivary gland pain (P = 0.152). SSEs developed in 14% of patients receiving administered activities of 1,110 MBq (30 mCi); administered activities of 2,775 MBq (75 mCi) or more were associated with symptoms in 40% of patients (P = 0.046). Despite receiving a statistically higher administered activity (5,661 +/- 2,997 MBq [153 +/- 81 mCi] for THW vs. 4,958 +/- 2,294 MBq [134 +/- 62 mCi] for rhTSH), THW was associated with a lower rate of salivary gland swelling than the rhTSH preparation (20% vs. 10%; P = 0.017), without differences in the development of dry mouth, altered taste, or salivary gland pain. Although SSEs occurred in 39% of patients after routine RRA, they were usually transient, so that the overall incidence of persistent side effects at a median follow-up of 7 y was only 5%. Even though the risk for persistent side effects is rather small, these data do emphasize the need to select patients carefully for RRA who are thought to be at moderate to high risk for recurrence

Recurrence after treatment of micropapillary thyroid cancer.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2009-10-01,"Despite very low mortality associated with micropapillary thyroid cancer, locoregional recurrence is common and controversy exists regarding optimal surgical treatment and the role of adjunctive radioiodine. The National Thyroid Cancer Treatment Cooperative Study Group Registry was analyzed for recurrences in patients with unifocal versus multifocal micropapillary cancer, with or without nodal disease, depending upon the extent of surgery and the use of adjunctive radioiodine. Six hundred eleven patients considered disease-free after initial therapy were followed for 2572 person-years. Thirty patients (6.2%) had recurrences detected at a mean 2.8 years after primary treatment. Recurrences did not differ between patients with unifocal and multifocal disease overall; however, among patients who received less than a near-total thyroidectomy (NTT), those with multifocal disease had more recurrences than those with unifocal disease (18% vs. 4%, p = 0.01). Patients with multifocal disease who had a total (T) or NTT trended toward fewer recurrences than those undergoing less than an NTT (6% vs. 18%, p = 0.058). In patients who did not receive radioiodine therapy, recurrence was more common in patients with multifocal disease versus unifocal disease (7% vs. 2%, p = 0.02). However, radioiodine did not reduce recurrences in patients with multifocal disease or patients with positive nodes.

Since the publication of the American Thyroid Association's guidelines for the management of these disorders was published in 2006, a large amount of new information has become available, prompting a revision of the guidelines. Relevant articles through December 2008 were reviewed by the task force and categorized by topic and level of evidence according to a modified schema used by the United States Preventative Services Task Force. The revised guidelines for the management of thyroid nodules include recommendations regarding initial evaluation, clinical and ultrasound criteria for fine-needle aspiration biopsy, interpretation of fine-needle aspiration biopsy results, and management of benign thyroid nodules. Recommendations regarding the initial management of thyroid cancer include those relating to optimal surgical management, radioiodine remnant ablation, and suppression therapy using levothyroxine. Recommendations related to long-term management of differentiated thyroid cancer include those related to surveillance for recurrent disease using ultrasound and serum thyroglobulin as well as those related to management of recurrent and metastatic disease.

Consensus statement on the terminology and classification of central neck dissection for thyroid cancer.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2009-11-01,"The primary goals of this interdisciplinary consensus statement are to review the relevant anatomy of the central neck compartment, to identify the nodal subgroups within the central compartment commonly involved in thyroid cancer, and to define a consistent terminology relevant to the central compartment neck dissection. The most commonly involved central lymph nodes in thyroid carcinoma are the prelaryngeal (Delphian), pretracheal, and the right and left paratracheal nodal basins. A central neck dissection includes comprehensive, compartment-oriented removal of the prelaryngeal and pretracheal nodes and at least one paratracheal lymph node basin. A designation should be made as to whether a unilateral or bilateral dissection is performed and on which side (left or right) in unilateral cases. Lymph node ""plucking"" or ""berry picking"" implies removal only of the clinically involved nodes rather than a complete nodal group within the compartment and is not recommended. A therapeutic central compartment neck dissection implies that nodal metastasis is apparent clinically (preoperatively or intraoperatively) or by imaging (clinically N1a). A prophylactic/elective central compartment dissection implies nodal metastasis is not detected clinically or by imaging (clinically N0). Central neck dissection at a minimum should consist of removal of the prelaryngeal, pretracheal, and paratracheal lymph nodes. The description of a central neck dissection should include both the indication (therapeutic vs. prophylactic/elective) and the extent of the dissection (unilateral or bilateral).",Consensus Development Conference,3733.0,332.0,The primary goals of this interdisciplinary consensus statement are to review the relevant anatomy of the central compartment to identify the nodal subgroups within the central compartment commonly involved in cancer and to define a consistent terminology relevant to the central compartment dissection The most commonly involved central lymph nodes in carcinoma are the prelaryngeal Delphian pretracheal and the right and left paratracheal nodal basins A central dissection includes comprehensive compartment-oriented removal of the prelaryngeal and pretracheal nodes and at least one paratracheal lymph node basin A designation should be made as to whether a unilateral or bilateral dissection is performed and on which side left or right in unilateral cases Lymph node `` plucking '' or `` berry picking '' implies removal only of the clinically involved nodes rather than a complete nodal group within the compartment and is not recommended A therapeutic central compartment dissection implies that nodal metastasis is apparent clinically preoperatively or intraoperatively or by imaging clinically N1a A prophylactic/elective central compartment dissection implies nodal metastasis is not detected clinically or by imaging clinically N0 Central dissection at a minimum should consist of removal of the prelaryngeal pretracheal and paratracheal lymph nodes The description of a central dissection should include both the indication therapeutic vs. prophylactic/elective and the extent of the dissection unilateral or bilateral,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[3, 86, 2802, 1, 26, 5911, 1391, 5914, 32, 6, 206, 3, 867, 5081, 1, 3, 854, 3616, 6, 255, 3, 779, 1453, 262, 3, 854, 3616, 841, 646, 4, 12, 2, 6, 1107, 8, 925, 3462, 867, 6, 3, 854, 3616, 1161, 3, 96, 841, 646, 854, 263, 502, 4, 134, 32, 3, 39142, 58363, 39143, 2, 3, 1913, 2, 1712, 26548, 779, 7847, 8, 854, 1161, 1920, 949, 3616, 8095, 2829, 1, 3, 39142, 2, 39143, 502, 2, 28, 506, 104, 26548, 263, 289, 6969, 8, 8402, 257, 40, 1229, 22, 6, 317, 8, 3208, 15, 1607, 1161, 16, 173, 2, 23, 92, 1152, 1712, 15, 1913, 4, 3208, 140, 263, 289, 43835, 522, 15, 26886, 31181, 522, 10441, 2829, 158, 1, 3, 505, 646, 502, 1832, 76, 8, 236, 779, 87, 262, 3, 3616, 2, 16, 44, 793, 8, 189, 854, 3616, 1161, 10441, 17, 779, 278, 16, 2235, 505, 3888, 15, 6595, 15, 20, 270, 505, 31126, 8, 1862, 4700, 854, 3616, 1161, 10441, 779, 278, 16, 44, 530, 505, 15, 20, 270, 505, 3394, 854, 1161, 28, 8, 2499, 257, 10451, 1, 2829, 1, 3, 39142, 39143, 2, 26548, 263, 502, 3, 5263, 1, 8, 854, 1161, 257, 643, 110, 3, 3607, 189, 105, 1862, 4700, 2, 3, 1039, 1, 3, 1161, 3208, 15, 1607]",1530.0,19860578,353
Anaplastic thyroid cancer: Clinical outcomes with conformal radiotherapy.,Head & neck,Head Neck,2010-07-01,"The aim of this study was to review institutional outcomes for anaplastic thyroid cancer treated with conformal 3-dimensional radiotherapy (3DRT) or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). In all, 53 consecutive patients were analyzed. Thirty-one (58%) patients were irradiated with curative intent. Median radiation dose was 55 Gray (Gy; range, 4-70 Gy). Thirteen (25%) patients received IMRT to a median 60 Gy (range, 39.9-69.0 Gy). Thirty-nine (74%) patients received chemotherapy with radiation. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival (OS) at 1 year for definitively irradiated patients was 29%. Patients without distant metastases receiving >or=50 Gy had superior survival outcomes; 5 such patients had no evidence of disease at last follow-up.

A phase I trial of paclitaxel and trastuzumab in combination with interleukin-12 in patients with HER2/neu-expressing malignancies.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2009-11-03,"Our preclinical work showed a dramatic synergy between interleukin-12 (IL-12) and trastuzumab for stimulation of natural killer cell cytokine secretion. We aimed to determine the safety profile of IL-12 when given in combination with trastuzumab and paclitaxel to patients with metastatic HER2-overexpressing cancers. Paclitaxel was given i.v. at 175 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. Trastuzumab was given on day 1 each week (4 mg/kg initially and 2 mg/kg thereafter) in combination with injections of IL-12 on days 2 and 5 starting in cycle 2. This trial accrued 21 patients with metastatic HER2-positive tumors (breast, 7; colon, 6; esophagus, 4; stomach, 2; pancreas, 1; thyroid, 1). The IL-12 component was dose-escalated in cohorts of three patients. The dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3 fatigue at the 300 ng/kg dose level in two patients. The recommended phase II dose was 200 ng/kg administered s.c. There was one complete response in a patient with breast cancer, partial responses in 4 patients (breast, 2; esophageal, 2), and stabilization of disease lasting 3 months or greater (SD) in 6 other patients. All but one response occurred in patients with HER2 3+ disease. Two SD patients completed 1 year of therapy. Ten patients had progressive disease. There was increased activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and increased levels of IFN-gamma and several chemokines in patients with clinical benefit (complete response, partial response, or SD), but not in patients with progressive disease.

Interactions of the Hdm2/p53 and proteasome pathways may enhance the antitumor activity of bortezomib.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2009-11-24,"p53 is inactivated in many human malignancies through missense mutations or overexpression of the human homologue of Mdm2 (Hdm2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates p53, thereby promoting its proteasomal degradation. The cis-imidazoline nutlin-3 can disrupt the p53-Hdm2 interaction and activate p53, inducing apoptosis in vitro in many malignancies, including multiple myeloma (MM). We hypothesized that suppression of Hdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination may augment sequelae of p53 accumulation caused by proteasomal inhibition. We compared the response of MM cells versus several epithelial cancer models to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in combination with nutlin-3. The combination of sublethal concentrations of bortezomib plus nutlin-3 induced additive cytotoxicity against bortezomib-sensitive MM cell lines. Importantly, however, in breast, prostate, colon, and thyroid (papillary, follicular, anaplastic, and medullary) carcinoma cell lines, this combination triggered synergistic cytotoxicity, and increased expression of p53, p21, Hdm2, Bax, Noxa, PUMA, and cleavage of caspase-3 and poly ADP ribose polymerase.

A phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced solid malignancies indicated that XL-184 accumulated dose-dependently in the plasma and had a long terminal half-life. A phase II trial in patients with progressive or recurrent glioblastoma revealed modest but promising median progression-free survival. Toxicity and side effects for the drug have generally been of low-to-moderate severity. At the time of publication, three additional trials of XL-184 were recruiting patients, including a phase I trial in combination with standard of care in patients with glioblastoma, a phase I/II trial in combination with erlotinib in patients with NSCLC, and a phase III trial in patients with medullary thyroid cancer.",Journal Article,3641.0,83.0,XL-184 BMS-907351 under development by Exelixis Inc and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co is a pan-tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the potential oral treatment of medullary cancer glioblastoma multiforme and NSCLC The prinicipal targets of XL-184 are MET VEGFR-2 and RET but the drug is also reported to display inhibitory activity against KIT FLT3 and TEK Preclinical studies demonstrated that XL-184 potently inhibited multiple receptor tyrosine kinases in various cancer cell lines and animal xenograft models and that the drug exhibited significant oral bioavailability and blood-brain barrier penetration A phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced solid malignancies indicated that XL-184 accumulated dose-dependently in the plasma and had a long terminal half-life A phase II trial in patients with progressive or recurrent glioblastoma revealed modest but promising median progression-free survival Toxicity and side effects for the drug have generally been of low-to-moderate severity At the time of publication three additional trials of XL-184 were recruiting patients including a phase I trial in combination with standard of care in patients with glioblastoma a phase I/II trial in combination with erlotinib in patients with NSCLC and a phase III trial in patients with medullary cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[3870, 5894, 3502, 58624, 669, 193, 20, 22593, 3479, 2, 8116, 8117, 8118, 1269, 16, 8, 3055, 564, 216, 230, 9, 3, 174, 518, 24, 1, 4564, 12, 996, 3238, 2, 304, 3, 58625, 637, 1, 3870, 5894, 32, 543, 2134, 18, 2, 2412, 84, 3, 234, 16, 120, 210, 6, 3640, 1810, 128, 480, 1164, 1224, 2, 26865, 693, 94, 264, 17, 3870, 5894, 4684, 879, 232, 153, 564, 1549, 4, 747, 12, 31, 285, 2, 2026, 1330, 274, 2, 17, 3, 234, 1416, 93, 518, 5499, 2, 315, 342, 3318, 4618, 8, 124, 70, 38, 160, 4, 7, 5, 131, 537, 441, 1103, 17, 3870, 5894, 6664, 61, 12968, 4, 3, 554, 2, 42, 8, 319, 2158, 1303, 358, 8, 124, 215, 160, 4, 7, 5, 1014, 15, 387, 996, 553, 1721, 84, 721, 52, 91, 115, 25, 155, 2, 1152, 176, 9, 3, 234, 47, 1228, 85, 1, 154, 6, 1163, 1702, 28, 3, 98, 1, 4397, 169, 402, 143, 1, 3870, 5894, 11, 9200, 7, 141, 8, 124, 70, 160, 4, 150, 5, 260, 1, 165, 4, 7, 5, 996, 8, 124, 70, 215, 160, 4, 150, 5, 962, 4, 7, 5, 304, 2, 8, 124, 316, 160, 4, 7, 5, 4564, 12]",1295.0,20127563,117
Tall-cell variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma: a matched-pair analysis of survival.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2010-02-01,"The tall-cell variant (TCV) of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is considered a more aggressive variant of PTC, with a poor prognosis. This is largely due to the tendency for TCV to present at an older age and with extrathyroidal extension (ETE). When these two variables are controlled for, it is unclear whether tall-cell histology alone portends a poor prognosis. Because previous studies have been underpowered to adequately answer this question, we hypothesized that TCV may have poorer prognosis than PTC. Our objective was to utilize a large cancer registry to obtain sufficient power to differentiate between outcomes in cases of TCV and PTC. Using the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we identified 278 TCV patients and 2522 classical PTC patients with sufficient information for a detailed matched-pair analysis. Each TCV patient was matched with a PTC patient for age, sex, extent of ETE, regional and distant metastases, surgical and adjuvant therapy, and year of diagnosis. The TCV cohort was then compared against all PTC cases and matched PTC cases. Compared with classical PTC, TCV patients presented at an older age (54.3 years vs. 46.3 years, p < 0.0001) had a higher rate of ETE (53.6% vs. 30.2%, p < 0.0001) and poorer 5-year disease-specific survival (81.9% vs. 97.8%, p < 0.0001). In the matched-pair analysis comparing TCV patients to the matched PTC cohort, 5-year disease-specific survival was poorer in the TCV cohort (81.9% vs. 91.3%, p = 0.049). The number of deaths in the TCV cohort was higher than in the matched PTC cohort (p = 0.043). TCV exhibits poorer survival than classical PTC.

Head circumference in the clinical detection of PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome in a clinic population at high-risk of breast cancer.,Breast cancer research and treatment,Breast Cancer Res. Treat.,2010-03-27,"PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome (PHTS) is often recognized by the presence of macrocephaly and associated mucocutaneous features, and is notable for a profound predisposition to breast and thyroid cancers. Head circumference (HC) is rarely measured when evaluating women at high risk for breast cancer, but may offer insight into characterizing cancer risk. Patients enrolled in the University of Michigan Cancer Genetics registry for breast cancer evaluation were analyzed for personal and family history of cancer and features of PHTS. This group of women was compared to all women who had undergone PTEN testing and whether or not they met clinical criteria for PHTS. Among the 164 women referred for breast cancer risk evaluation, a statistically significant difference in mean HC was found between women who did (57.3 cm) and did not (55.4 cm) meet clinical criteria for PHTS with both values below the established threshold for macrocephaly (58 cm). The sensitivity and specificity of macrocephaly for the presence of a PTEN mutation were 100 and 53%, respectively, among the 28 women tested. The positive predictive value was 14%. PTEN mutation positive and PTEN mutation negative women were not well differentiated by PHTS clinical criteria (P = 0.2348).

Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors for patients with differentiated thyroid cancer: the M. D. Anderson experience.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2010-04-14,"Until recently, treatment options for patients with progressive, radioactive iodine-resistant differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) have been limited. In our clinical practice, we have begun to use sorafenib and sunitinib for patients with progressive DTC who are not able or willing to participate in clinical trials. In this paper, we describe the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center's experience with the off-label use of these tyrosine kinase inhibitors for DTC. Adult patients were included if they had a diagnosis of radioactive iodine-refractory DTC, were treated with single agent sorafenib or sunitinib, and had both baseline and at least one follow-up scan for restaging purposes. All imaging data were collected, as well as the TSH-suppressed thyroglobulin (Tg) levels corresponding to each scan date. The primary endpoints were radiographic response and progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary objectives were tissue-specific radiographic responses and correlation of Tg with overall response. We identified 33 patients from our clinical database. Fifteen patients (nine women, six men) met inclusion criteria, with a median age of 61 yr (range, 38-83 yr). Eight patients had papillary and seven had follicular thyroid carcinoma. Sorafenib was used in 13 and sunitinib in two, including one patient who failed prior sorafenib therapy. All patients had evidence of progressive disease (PD) before start of therapy, with a median PFS of only 4 months. Best response in target lesions was: partial response (PR) in three (20%), stable disease (SD) in nine (60%), and PD in three (20%). Clinical benefit (PR+SD) was 80%. The sunitinib patient previously refractory to sorafenib had a 38% reduction in tumor size. The most noticeable organ-specific response was observed in lung (median change, -22%) compared to lymph nodes (median change, 0%). Pleural disease and nonirradiated bone metastases demonstrated PD. All histological subtypes had similar responses. The median PFS was 19 months. The median overall survival has not yet been reached, but at 2 yr of follow-up, overall survival is 67%. Log Tg correlated with radiographic response (P = 0.0005). Sorafenib and sunitinib appear to be effective in patients with widely metastatic, progressive DTC, with most patients achieving SD or PR, despite having PD at baseline. The most noticeable responses occurred in the lungs in contrast with minimal changes in nodal metastases and PD in pleural and nonirradiated bone metastases, suggesting a tissue-specific response to therapy. Log Tg significantly correlated with response to treatment and therefore may have value as a surrogate marker of response.",Journal Article,3569.0,138.0,Until recently treatment options for patients with progressive radioactive iodine-resistant differentiated cancer DTC have been limited In our clinical practice we have begun to use sorafenib and sunitinib for patients with progressive DTC who are not able or willing to participate in clinical trials In this paper we describe the University of Texas M.

"A phase I study of foretinib, a multi-targeted inhibitor of c-Met and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2010-05-14,"Foretinib is an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting Met, RON, Axl, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor. We conducted a phase I, first-time-in-human, clinical trial using escalating doses of oral foretinib. The primary objectives are to identify a maximum tolerated dose and determine the safety profile of foretinib. Secondary objectives included evaluation of plasma pharmacokinetics, long-term safety after repeated administration, preliminary antitumor activity, and pharmacodynamic activity. Patients had histologically confirmed metastatic or unresectable solid tumors for which no standard measures exist. All patients received foretinib orally for 5 consecutive days every 14 days. Dose escalation followed a conventional ""3+3"" design. Forty patients were treated in eight dose cohorts. The maximum tolerated dose was defined as 3.6 mg/kg, with a maximum administered dose of 4.5 mg/kg. Dose-limiting toxicities included grade 3 elevations in aspartate aminotransferase and lipase. Additional non-dose-limiting adverse events included hypertension, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, proteinuria, and hematuria. Responses were observed in two patients with papillary renal cell cancer and one patient with medullary thyroid cancer. Stable disease was identified in 22 patients. Foretinib pharmacokinetics increased linearly with dose.

Genetic alterations in the RAS/RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathways in the follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-06-01,"The follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC) is the second most common histotype among papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs). Although the prognosis of FVPTC is similar to the conventional phenotype, differential diagnostic difficulties may not be uncommon with other follicular thyroid neoplasms, and little is known about their genetic alterations. Defining these alterations may lead to the identification of diagnostic and biologic markers. In this study, the authors evaluated genetic alterations and downstream-activated signals of the Ras/Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene (Akt) (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathways in 30 FVPTC tissue specimens. Tumors and matched normal thyroid samples were tested for RAS, for the v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene (BRAF) substitution of valine (V) for glutamate (E) at codon 600 (the V600E mutation), for phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), for catalytic PI3k p110 subunit alpha (PIK3CA), for AKT, and for the presence of rearranged during transfection (ret) proto-oncogene/PTC (RET-PTC) and paired box-8 (PAX8)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) fusion protein (PAX8-PPARgamma) rearrangements by direct sequencing and reverse transcriptase-polymerases chain reaction analyses, respectively. Western blot analysis was used to assess the effects of these gene abnormalities on the activation of the 2 pathways. Genetic alterations were identified in 70% of FVPTCs. Activation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways was observed in 74% and 22% of tumors, respectively. The alterations that were identified in the genes of the 2 pathways were mutually exclusive. Chromosomal RET-PTC and PAX8-PPARgamma rearrangements were observed in 20% and 17% of tumors, respectively. It was noteworthy that some FVPTCs with RET-PTC had the coactivation of both pathways.

Frequent gastrointestinal polyps and colorectal adenocarcinomas in a prospective series of PTEN mutation carriers.,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,2010-06-27,"Germline phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) mutations cause Cowden syndrome (CS), associated with breast and thyroid cancers. Case reports found 35%-85% of CS patients had gastrointestinal (GI) hamartomas. The association of benign and malignant GI neoplasias with CS remains debatable. Our goal is to describe the GI phenotype in a prospective series of PTEN mutation carriers. Patients who met relaxed International Cowden Consortium criteria (N = 2548) or with 5 or more GI polyps, 1 or more of which was hyperplastic or hamartomatous (N = 397), were prospectively recruited. Germline PTEN mutation/deletion analysis was performed. Of the 2945 patients, 127 (123 of 2548 and 4 of 397, respectively) patients having clear pathogenic PTEN mutations were eligible for this study. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, and pathology reports were reviewed. The Fisher 2-tailed exact test, unpaired t tests, and age- and sex-adjusted standardized incidence ratio were calculated. Of 127 PTEN mutation carriers, 69 underwent 1 or more endoscopies with 64 (93%) having polyps. Of the 64, half had hyperplastic polyps. There were one to innumerable polyps in the colorectum, ileum, duodenum, stomach, and/or esophagus, with 24 subjects having both upper and lower GI polyps. Nine (13%) subjects had colorectal cancer, all younger than the age of 50. The adjusted standardized incidence ratio was 224.1 (95% confidence interval, 109.3-411.3; P < .0001).

The effect of posttherapy 131I SPECT/CT on risk classification and management of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",J. Nucl. Med.,2010-08-18,"The objective of this study was to determine whether posttherapy (131)I SPECT/CT changed the need for additional cross-sectional imaging or modified the American Thyroid Association risk of recurrence classification. We performed planar imaging and SPECT/CT in a consecutive series of patients after (131)I therapy. Planar imaging and SPECT/CT were performed on 148 consecutive patients with thyroid carcinoma (125 papillary, 2 follicular, 8 Hürthle cell, and 13 poorly differentiated) approximately 5 d after the therapeutic administration of 1,739-8,066 MBq (47-218 mCi) of (131)I. The indication for treatment was postsurgical ablation (n = 109) or recurrent or metastatic disease with rising thyroglobulin levels (n = 39). SPECT/CT scans were obtained for all subjects for 1 bed position (38 cm), which included the neck and upper chest. Additional SPECT/CT scans of the abdomen or pelvis were acquired if suggestive findings were noted on planar images. All patients were treated in real time, according to the standard of care in our practice. At that time, clinical decisions regarding thyroid tumor classification were made by our multidisciplinary group based on all data, including operative findings, pathology, imaging, and thyroglobulin levels. In a retrospective analysis, planar and SPECT/CT images were interpreted independently, and sites of uptake were categorized as likely benign, malignant, or equivocal. An experienced thyroid endocrinologist used a combination of surgical histopathology and scan findings to determine whether additional cross-sectional imaging was required and determined if the imaging findings changed the patient's risk category. In 29 patients, 61 additional cross-sectional imaging studies were avoided using SPECT/CT, compared with medical decision making based on the planar images alone. In 7 of 109 postsurgical patients, SPECT/CT findings changed the initial American Thyroid Association risk of recurrence classification. The sensitivity of planar imaging and SPECT/CT for identification of focal (131)I uptake in the thyroid bed was similar in the postsurgical and recurrence cohorts. For metastatic disease in the neck, characterization of (131)I uptake by SPECT/CT in the postsurgical group was significantly better than that by planar scanning (P < 0.01). Among the 109 postsurgical patients, the characterization of iodine uptake in the lung, liver, and bone was also more accurate using SPECT/CT than planar scanning (P < 0.01). The CT portion of SPECT/CT demonstrated non-iodine-avid lesions in 32 of 148 patients. SPECT/CT data provided information that reduced the need for additional cross-sectional imaging in 29 patients (20%) and significantly altered the initial risk of recurrence estimates in 7 of 109

Biomarkers as predictors of response to treatment with motesanib in patients with progressive advanced thyroid cancer.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2010-08-25,"Antiangiogenic therapies have shown potential in the treatment of advanced thyroid cancer, but it is uncertain which patients are most likely to benefit from therapy. This prespecified exploratory analysis investigated whether baseline levels and/or changes in circulating biomarkers could predict tumor response and/or progression-free survival (PFS) among patients enrolled in a phase 2 study of motesanib in advanced thyroid cancer. Patients with progressive locally advanced or metastatic medullary or differentiated thyroid cancer received motesanib 125 mg once daily for up to 48 wk in a phase 2 interventional study. Samples for assessment of circulating biomarkers of angiogenesis or apoptosis were collected at study wk 1 (baseline), 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, and 4 wk after cessation of motesanib treatment. Tumor response was assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors by independent review. Change from baseline in serum placental growth factor (PlGF) after 1 wk of treatment correlated with best tumor response (Kendall rank correlation, 0.28; P < 0.0001). Using a Fisher exact test, the most significant separation between patients who had an objective response and those who did not was at a 4.7-fold increase in PlGF. The response rate among patients with a greater than 4.7-fold increase in PlGF was 30% compared with 3% below this threshold. There was also a significant separation between responders and nonresponders at a 1.6-fold decrease in soluble vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 after 3 wk of treatment. Patients with baseline serum VEGF less than 671 pg/ml had significantly longer PFS times than the remainder of patients. Changes in PlGF and soluble VEGF receptor 2 levels after initiation of therapy predicted response to motesanib in patients with advanced differentiated thyroid cancer or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer. Lower baseline VEGF levels were associated with longer PFS.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",3436.0,,Antiangiogenic therapies have shown potential in the treatment of advanced cancer but it is uncertain which patients are most likely to benefit from therapy This prespecified exploratory analysis investigated whether baseline levels and/or changes in circulating biomarkers could predict tumor response and/or progression-free survival PFS among patients enrolled in a phase 2 study of motesanib in advanced cancer Patients with progressive locally advanced or metastatic medullary or differentiated cancer received motesanib 125 mg once daily for up to 48 wk in a phase 2 interventional study Samples for assessment of circulating biomarkers of angiogenesis or apoptosis were collected at study wk 1 baseline 2 4 8 16 24 32 40 48 and 4 wk after cessation of motesanib treatment Tumor response was assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors by independent review Change from baseline in serum placental growth factor PlGF after 1 wk of treatment correlated with best tumor response Kendall rank correlation 0.28 P 0.0001 Using a Fisher exact test the most significant separation between patients who had an objective response and those who did not was at a 4.7-fold increase in PlGF The response rate among patients with a greater than 4.7-fold increase in PlGF was 30 compared with 3 below this threshold There was also a significant separation between responders and nonresponders at a 1.6-fold decrease in soluble vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF receptor 2 after 3 wk of treatment Patients with baseline serum VEGF less than 671 pg/ml had significantly longer PFS times than the remainder of patients Changes in PlGF and soluble VEGF receptor 2 levels after initiation of therapy predicted response to motesanib in patients with advanced differentiated cancer or metastatic medullary cancer Lower baseline VEGF levels were associated with longer PFS,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[2168, 235, 47, 443, 174, 4, 3, 24, 1, 131, 12, 84, 192, 16, 2717, 92, 7, 32, 96, 322, 6, 247, 29, 36, 26, 4075, 2386, 65, 565, 317, 330, 148, 2, 15, 400, 4, 1033, 582, 359, 678, 30, 51, 2, 15, 91, 115, 25, 300, 107, 7, 346, 4, 8, 124, 18, 45, 1, 12218, 4, 131, 12, 7, 5, 1014, 795, 131, 15, 113, 4564, 15, 1442, 12, 103, 12218, 1731, 81, 1059, 391, 9, 126, 6, 576, 3293, 4, 8, 124, 18, 6182, 45, 347, 9, 455, 1, 1033, 582, 1, 1056, 15, 351, 11, 786, 28, 45, 3293, 14, 330, 18, 39, 66, 245, 259, 531, 327, 576, 2, 39, 3293, 50, 3345, 1, 12218, 24, 30, 51, 10, 275, 379, 51, 451, 371, 4, 537, 57, 20, 306, 206, 707, 29, 330, 4, 524, 9690, 129, 161, 7909, 50, 14, 3293, 1, 24, 438, 5, 824, 30, 51, 11657, 1026, 816, 13, 339, 19, 13, 488, 75, 8, 3135, 2472, 412, 3, 96, 93, 5422, 59, 7, 54, 42, 35, 461, 51, 2, 135, 54, 205, 44, 10, 28, 8, 39, 67, 1116, 344, 4, 7909, 3, 51, 116, 107, 7, 5, 8, 378, 76, 39, 67, 1116, 344, 4, 7909, 10, 201, 72, 5, 27, 2736, 26, 2390, 125, 10, 120, 8, 93, 5422, 59, 1983, 2, 4498, 28, 8, 14, 49, 1116, 775, 4, 2968, 756, 845, 129, 161, 618, 153, 18, 50, 27, 3293, 1, 24, 7, 5, 330, 524, 618, 299, 76, 12522, 3234, 542, 42, 97, 589, 300, 1072, 76, 3, 7095, 1, 7, 400, 4, 7909, 2, 2968, 618, 153, 18, 148, 50, 1118, 1, 36, 783, 51, 6, 12218, 4, 7, 5, 131, 1442, 12, 15, 113, 4564, 12, 280, 330, 618, 148, 11, 41, 5, 589, 300]",1875.0,20739388,289

Oncol.,2010-09-13,"This open-label, phase I, dose-escalation study assessed the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), safety, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of sunitinib in combination with capecitabine in patients with advanced solid tumors. Sunitinib (25, 37.5, or 50 mg) was administered orally once daily on three dosing schedules: 4 weeks on treatment, 2 weeks off treatment (Schedule 4/2); 2 weeks on treatment, 1 week off treatment (Schedule 2/1); and continuous daily dosing (CDD schedule). Capecitabine (825, 1,000, or 1,250 mg/m(2)) was administered orally twice daily on days 1 to 14 every 3 weeks for all patients. Sunitinib and capecitabine doses were escalated in serial patient cohorts. Seventy-three patients were treated. Grade 3 adverse events included abdominal pain, mucosal inflammation, fatigue, neutropenia, and hand-foot syndrome. The MTD for Schedule 4/2 and the CDD schedule was sunitinib 37.5 mg/d plus capecitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) twice per day; the MTD for Schedule 2/1 was sunitinib 50 mg/d plus capecitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) twice per day. There were no clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. Nine partial responses were confirmed in patients with pancreatic cancer (n = 3) and breast, thyroid, neuroendocrine, bladder, and colorectal cancer, and cholangiocarcinoma (each n = 1).

Phase I study of vorinostat in patients with advanced solid tumors and hepatic dysfunction: a National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2010-09-13,"Vorinostat is the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved histone deacetylase inhibitor and is indicated for the treatment of refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. We conducted a phase I study to determine the maximum-tolerated dose and pharmacokinetics of vorinostat in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Patients had solid malignancies and acceptable bone marrow and renal function. Hepatic dysfunction was categorized as mild, moderate, or severe by the National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group criteria. Fifteen patients with normal liver function were enrolled as controls. All patients received a single 400-mg dose of vorinostat for pharmacokinetic studies. One week later, daily vorinostat dosing was begun and continued until toxicity or disease progression occurred. The daily vorinostat dose was escalated within each hepatic dysfunction category. Vorinostat plasma concentrations were quantitated by a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay and modeled noncompartmentally. Fifty-seven patients were enrolled (median age, 59 years; females, n = 24); 42 patients had hepatic dysfunction (16 mild, 15 moderate, and 11 severe). Eight of nine patients with dose-limiting toxicity had grade 4 thrombocytopenia. The recommended vorinostat doses in mild, moderate, and severe hepatic dysfunction were 300, 200, and 100 mg, respectively, on the daily continuous schedule. There were no significant differences in vorinostat pharmacokinetic parameters among the normal or hepatic dysfunction categories. Disease stabilization was noted in 12 patients.

Cancer Res.,2010-09-16,"We conducted a phase II study to assess the efficacy of continuous dosing of sunitinib in patients with flurodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)-avid, iodine-refractory well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma (WDTC) and medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and to assess for early response per FDG-PET. Patients had metastatic, iodine-refractory WDTC or MTC with FDG-PET-avid disease. Sunitinib was administered at 37.5 mg daily on a continuous basis. The primary end point was response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Secondary end points included toxicity, overall survival, and time to progression. We conducted an exploratory analysis of FDG-PET response after 7 days of treatment. Thirty-five patients were enrolled (7 MTC, 28 WDTC), and 33 patients were evaluable for disease response. The primary end point, objective response rate per RECIST, was 11 patients (31%; 95% confidence interval, 16-47%). There were 1 complete response (3%), 10 partial responses (28%), and 16 patients (46%) with stable disease. Progressive disease was seen in 6 patients (17%). The median time to progression was 12.8 months (95% confidence interval, 8.9 months-not reached). Repeat FDG-PET was done on 22 patients. The median percent change in average standardized uptake values was -11.7%, -13.9%, and 8.6% for patients with RECIST response, stable disease, and progressive disease, respectively. Differences between response categories were statistically significant (P = 0.03). The most common toxicities seen included fatigue (11%), neutropenia (34%), hand/foot syndrome (17%), diarrhea (17%), and leukopenia (31%). One patient on anticoagulation died of gastrointestinal bleeding. Continuous administration of sunitinib was effective in patients with iodine-refractory WDTC and MTC.

"Efficacy of pazopanib in progressive, radioiodine-refractory, metastatic differentiated thyroid cancers: results of a phase 2 consortium study.",The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2010-09-17,"Chemotherapy has historically proven ineffective in advanced differentiated thyroid cancers, but the realisation that various tyrosine kinases are activated in the disease suggested a potential therapeutic role for tyrosine-kinase inhibitors. We investigated the safety and efficacy of pazopanib. This phase 2 trial was done from Feb 22, 2008, to Jan 31, 2009, in patients with metastatic, rapidly progressive, radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancers. Each patient received 800 mg continuous pazopanib daily in 4-week cycles until disease progression, drug intolerance, or both occurred. Up to two previous therapies were allowed, and measurable disease with radiographic progression in the 6-month period before enrolment was a requirement for inclusion. The primary endpoint was any tumour response, according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.0. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00625846. 39 patients were enrolled. One patient had received no previous radioiodine therapy and another withdrew consent before treatment. Clinical outcomes could, therefore, be assessed in 37 patients (19 [51%] men, median age 63 years). The study is closed to accrual of new patients, but several enrolled patients are still being treated. Patients received a median of 12 cycles (range 1 to >23, total >383). Confirmed partial responses were recorded in 18 patients (response rate 49%, 95% CI 35-68), with likelihood of response lasting longer than 1 year calculated to be 66%. Maximum concentration of pazopanib in plasma during cycle one was significantly correlated with radiographic response (r=-0·40, p=0·021). 16 (43%) patients required dose reductions owing to adverse events, the most frequent of which (any grade) were fatigue (29 patients), skin and hair hypopigmentation (28), diarrhoea (27), and nausea (27). Two patients who died during treatment had pre-existing contributory disorders. Pazopanib seems to represent a promising therapeutic option for patients with advanced differentiated thyroid cancers. The correlation of the patient's response and pazopanib concentration during the first cycle might indicate that treatment can be individualised to achieve optimum outcomes. Assessment of pazopanib in an expanded cohort of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer, as well as in cohorts of patients with medullary and anaplastic thyroid cancers, is presently being done.

Mendelian genetics of rare--and not so rare--cancers.,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci.,2010-09-28,"Mendelian genetics forms the basis for gene-informed risk assessment and management for the patient and family, and should be at the very foundation of 21st century personalization of healthcare. Yet this is an underutilized commodity. Identification and characterization of germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene, encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase, as causing >90% of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by medullary thyroid cancer, pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism, heralded the era of evidence-based molecular diagnosis, predictive testing, genetic counseling, gene-informed cancer risk assessment, and preventative medicine.

Regional variations between guidelines exist. Adherence to thyroid cancer guidelines at national levels is less than ideal. Guidelines for the management of differentiated thyroid cancer should continue to reflect minor regional variations in thyroid cancer treatment based on factors unique to that population while remaining otherwise similar to ensure optimal state-of-the-art patient care and outcomes.

Risk of second primary thyroid cancer after radiotherapy for a childhood cancer in a large cohort study: an update from the childhood cancer survivor study.,Radiation research,Radiat. Res.,2010-10-06,"Previous studies have indicated that thyroid cancer risk after a first childhood malignancy is curvilinear with radiation dose, increasing at low to moderate doses and decreasing at high doses. Understanding factors that modify the radiation dose response over the entire therapeutic dose range is challenging and requires large numbers of subjects. We quantified the long-term risk of thyroid cancer associated with radiation treatment among 12,547 5-year survivors of a childhood cancer (leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, central nervous system cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, kidney cancer, bone cancer, neuroblastoma) diagnosed between 1970 and 1986 in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study using the most current cohort follow-up to 2005. There were 119 subsequent pathologically confirmed thyroid cancer cases, and individual radiation doses to the thyroid gland were estimated for the entire cohort. This cohort study builds on the previous case-control study in this population (69 thyroid cancer cases with follow-up to 2000) by allowing the evaluation of both relative and absolute risks. Poisson regression analyses were used to calculate standardized incidence ratios (SIR), excess relative risks (ERR) and excess absolute risks (EAR) of thyroid cancer associated with radiation dose. Other factors such as sex, type of first cancer, attained age, age at exposure to radiation, time since exposure to radiation, and chemotherapy (yes/no) were assessed for their effect on the linear and exponential quadratic terms describing the dose-response relationship. Similar to the previous analysis, thyroid cancer risk increased linearly with radiation dose up to approximately 20 Gy, where the relative risk peaked at 14.6-fold (95% CI, 6.8-31.5). At thyroid radiation doses >20 Gy, a downturn in the dose-response relationship was observed. The ERR model that best fit the data was linear-exponential quadratic. We found that age at exposure modified the ERR linear dose term (higher radiation risk with younger age) (P < 0.001) and that sex (higher radiation risk among females) (P  =  0.008) and time since exposure (higher radiation risk with longer time) (P < 0.001) modified the EAR linear dose term.

Long-term effects of radiation exposure among adult survivors of childhood cancer: results from the childhood cancer survivor study.,Radiation research,Radiat. Res.,2010-09-17,"In the last four decades, advances in therapies for primary cancers have improved overall survival for childhood cancer. Currently, almost 80% of children will survive beyond 5 years from diagnosis of their primary malignancy. These improved outcomes have resulted in a growing population of childhood cancer survivors. Radiation therapy, while an essential component of primary treatment for many childhood malignancies, has been associated with risk of long-term adverse outcomes. The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS), a retrospective cohort of over 14,000 survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed between 1970 and 1986, has been an important resource to quantify associations between radiation therapy and risk of long-term adverse health and quality of life outcomes. Radiation therapy has been associated with increased risk for late mortality, development of second neoplasms, obesity, and pulmonary, cardiac and thyroid dysfunction as well as an increased overall risk for chronic health conditions. Importantly, the CCSS has provided more precise estimates for a number of dose-response relationships, including those for radiation therapy and development of subsequent malignant neoplasms of the central nervous system, thyroid and breast.

Influence of prophylactic central lymph node dissection on postoperative thyroglobulin levels and radioiodine treatment in papillary thyroid cancer.,Surgery,Surgery,2010-12-01,"Prophylactic central lymph node dissection with total thyroidectomy (TT) for the treatment of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is controversial because of the possibility of increased morbidity with uncertain benefit. The purpose of this study is to determine whether prophylactic central neck dissection provides any advantages over TT alone. Retrospective cohort study of patients with PTC without preoperative evidence of lymph node involvement undergoing either TT or TT with bilateral central lymph node dissection (TT + BCLND). From 2002 to 2009, 143 patients with clinically node-negative PTC underwent either TT (n = 65) or TT + BCLND (n = 78). The groups were similar in age, gender, tumor size, multifocality, angioinvasion, and metastasis/age/completeness-of-resection/invasion/size score. The presence of involved central neck lymph nodes upstaged 28.6% of patients in the TT + BCLND group to stage III disease, which resulted in higher radioactive iodine ablation doses. Stimulated serum thyroglobulin levels and the number of patients with undetectable stimulated thyroglobulin levels before and 1 year after radioactive iodine ablation were equivalent.

Germline epigenetic regulation of KILLIN in Cowden and Cowden-like syndrome.,JAMA,JAMA,2010-12-01,"Germline loss-of-function phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) mutations cause 80% of Cowden syndrome, a rare autosomal-dominant disorder (1 in 200,000 live births), characterized by high risks of breast, thyroid, and other cancers. A large heterogeneous group of individuals with Cowden-like syndrome, who have various combinations of Cowden syndrome features but who do not meet Cowden syndrome diagnostic criteria, have PTEN mutations less than 10% of the time, making molecular diagnosis, prediction, genetic counseling, and risk management challenging. Other mechanisms of loss of function such as hypermethylation, which should result in underexpression of PTEN or of KILLIN, a novel tumor suppressor transcribed in the opposite direction, may account for the remainder of Cowden syndrome and Cowden-like syndrome. To determine whether germline methylation is found in Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome in individuals lacking germline PTEN mutations. Nucleic acids from prospective nested series of 123 patients with Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome and 50 unaffected individuals without PTEN variants were analyzed for germline methylation and expression of PTEN and KILLIN at the Cleveland Clinic, August 2008-June 2010. Prevalence of component cancers between groups was compared using the Fisher exact test. Frequency of germline methylation in PTEN mutation-negative Cowden syndrome and Cowden syndrome-like individuals. Prevalence of component cancers in methylation-positive and PTEN mutation-positive individuals. Of 123 patients with Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome, 45 (37%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 29%-45%) showed hypermethylation upstream of PTEN but no transcriptional repression. The germline methylation was found to transcriptionally down-regulate KILLIN by 250-fold (95% CI, 45-14 286; P = .007) and exclusively disrupted TP53 activation of KILLIN by 30% (95% CI, 7%-45%; P = .008). Demethylation treatment increased only KILLIN expression 4.88-fold (95% CI, 1.4-18.1; P = .05).

Survival and long-term health and cognitive outcomes after low-grade glioma.,Neuro-oncology,Neuro-oncology,2010-12-22,"Long-term morbidity for children with low-grade glioma (LGG) requires exposure-specific characterization. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated for 361 children diagnosed with LGG between 1985 and 2007 at a single institution. Five-year survivors (n = 240) received risk-based clinical assessment. Cumulative incidence of late effects 15 years from diagnosis were estimated. Risk factors for adverse health were identified using Fine and Gray's approach to Cox's proportional hazards model, accounting for death as a competing risk. OS at 15 years was 86% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82%-90%), and PFS was 55% (95% CI 51%-58%). Among the 240 5-year survivors, the 5-, 10-, and 15-year cumulative incidence of adverse outcomes included blindness: 10%, 13%, and 18%, respectively; hearing loss: 8%, 14%, and 22%; obesity/overweight: 18%, 35%, and 53%; hyperinsulinism: 1%, 5%, and 24%; growth hormone deficiency: 13%, 27%, and 29%;thyroid hormone deficiency: 16%, 28%, and 33%; and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency: 12%, 22%, and 26%. Multivariable models demonstrated radiation therapy to be a significant independent predictor of hearing loss, growth hormone deficiency, abnormal thyroid function, and ACTH deficiency. Diencephalic location was a statistically significant independent risk factor for blindness, growth hormone deficiency, abnormal thyroid function, and ACTH deficiency. Among the 182 5-year survivors assessed for intellectual function, 34% had an intelligence quotient (IQ) below average (<85), associated with younger age at diagnosis, epilepsy, and shunt placement.

Thyrotrophin receptor signaling dependence of Braf-induced thyroid tumor initiation in mice.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2011-01-10,"Mutations of BRAF are found in ∼45% of papillary thyroid cancers and are enriched in tumors with more aggressive properties. We developed mice with a thyroid-specific knock-in of oncogenic Braf (LSL-Braf(V600E)/TPO-Cre) to explore the role of endogenous expression of this oncoprotein on tumor initiation and progression. In contrast to other Braf-induced mouse models of tumorigenesis (i.e., melanomas and lung), in which knock-in of Braf(V600E) induces mostly benign lesions, Braf-expressing thyrocytes become transformed and progress to invasive carcinomas with a very short latency, a process that is dampened by treatment with an allosteric MEK inhibitor. These mice also become profoundly hypothyroid due to deregulation of genes involved in thyroid hormone biosynthesis and consequently have high TSH levels. To determine whether TSH signaling cooperates with oncogenic Braf in this process, we first crossed LSL-Braf(V600E)/TPO-Cre with TshR knockout mice. Although oncogenic Braf was appropriately activated in thyroid follicular cells of these mice, they had a lower mitotic index and were not transformed. Thyroid-specific deletion of the Gsα gene in LSL-Braf(V600E)/TPO-Cre/Gnas-E1(fl/fl) mice also resulted in an attenuated cancer phenotype, indicating that the cooperation of TshR with oncogenic Braf is mediated in part by cAMP signaling. Once tumors were established in mice with wild-type TshR, suppression of TSH did not revert the phenotype. These data demonstrate the key role of TSH signaling in Braf-induced papillary thyroid cancer initiation and provide experimental support for recent observations in humans pointing to a strong association between TSH levels and thyroid cancer incidence.",Journal Article,3298.0,122.0,Mutations of BRAF are found in ∼45 of papillary cancers and are enriched in tumors with more aggressive properties We developed mice with a thyroid-specific knock-in of oncogenic Braf LSL-Braf V600E /TPO-Cre to explore the role of endogenous expression of this oncoprotein on tumor initiation and progression In contrast to other Braf-induced mouse models of tumorigenesis i.e. melanomas and in which knock-in of Braf V600E induces mostly benign lesions Braf-expressing thyrocytes become transformed and progress to invasive carcinomas with a very short latency a process that is dampened by treatment with an allosteric MEK inhibitor These mice also become profoundly hypothyroid due to deregulation of genes involved in hormone biosynthesis and consequently have high TSH levels To determine whether TSH signaling cooperates with oncogenic Braf in this process we first crossed LSL-Braf V600E /TPO-Cre with TshR knockout mice Although oncogenic Braf was appropriately activated in follicular cells of these mice they had a lower mitotic index and were not transformed Thyroid-specific deletion of the Gsα gene in LSL-Braf V600E /TPO-Cre/Gnas-E1 fl/fl mice also resulted in an attenuated cancer phenotype indicating that the cooperation of TshR with oncogenic Braf is mediated in part by cAMP signaling Once tumors were established in mice with wild-type TshR suppression of TSH did not revert the phenotype These data demonstrate the key role of TSH signaling in Braf-induced papillary cancer initiation and provide experimental support for recent observations in humans pointing to a strong association between TSH levels and cancer incidence,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[138, 1, 566, 32, 204, 4, 59713, 1, 1796, 163, 2, 32, 2220, 4, 57, 5, 80, 571, 1571, 21, 276, 399, 5, 8, 11260, 112, 6252, 4, 1, 1302, 566, 11206, 566, 2047, 14110, 7102, 6, 1645, 3, 200, 1, 2682, 55, 1, 26, 6159, 23, 30, 1118, 2, 91, 4, 748, 6, 127, 566, 277, 830, 274, 1, 1565, 70, 563, 1965, 2, 4, 92, 6252, 4, 1, 566, 2047, 1516, 2754, 1002, 406, 566, 1046, 59714, 1417, 2423, 2, 1466, 6, 416, 826, 5, 8, 923, 978, 5301, 8, 1129, 17, 16, 26503, 20, 24, 5, 35, 8985, 1693, 230, 46, 399, 120, 1417, 8802, 18875, 520, 6, 4765, 1, 214, 646, 4, 785, 6225, 2, 3244, 47, 64, 6581, 148, 6, 223, 317, 6581, 314, 12535, 5, 1302, 566, 4, 26, 1129, 21, 157, 7023, 11206, 566, 2047, 14110, 7102, 5, 35038, 5687, 399, 242, 1302, 566, 10, 4544, 735, 4, 1974, 37, 1, 46, 399, 491, 42, 8, 280, 2346, 558, 2, 11, 44, 2423, 11260, 112, 1528, 1, 3, 59715, 145, 4, 11206, 566, 2047, 14110, 7102, 8624, 6778, 2633, 2633, 399, 120, 627, 4, 35, 2656, 12, 1005, 1716, 17, 3, 8323, 1, 35038, 5, 1302, 566, 16, 517, 4, 760, 20, 10837, 314, 1059, 57, 11, 635, 4, 399, 5, 955, 267, 35038, 1332, 1, 6581, 205, 44, 24495, 3, 1005, 46, 74, 608, 3, 825, 200, 1, 6581, 314, 4, 566, 277, 1796, 12, 1118, 2, 377, 1560, 538, 9, 435, 2172, 4, 3218, 11548, 6, 8, 1082, 248, 59, 6581, 148, 2, 12, 287]",1645.0,21220306,300
Targeted therapy of VEGFR2 and EGFR significantly inhibits growth of anaplastic thyroid cancer in an orthotopic murine model.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2011-01-10,"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is one of the most lethal human cancers with a median survival of 6 months. The inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) alone, or with VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), represents an attractive approach for treatment of ATC. Several reports have examined agents that target these receptors. However, with the misidentification of as many as 60% of all commonly used ATC cell lines, the significance of these past findings is unclear. Cell lines authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling were selected to establish xenograft tumors in an orthotopic murine model of ATC. These mice were then treated with vandetanib to evaluate its effects on ATC tumor growth. Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI was utilized to measure the impact of vandetanib on tumor vasculature. Vandetanib inhibited tumor growth of the ATC cell lines Hth83 and 8505C in vivo by 69.3% (P < 0.001) and 66.6% (P < 0.05), respectively, when compared with control.

Inhibition of pituitary tumor-transforming gene-1 in thyroid cancer cells by drugs that decrease specificity proteins.,Molecular carcinogenesis,Mol. Carcinog.,2011-01-25,"Methyl 2-cyano-3,11-dioxo-18β-olean-1,12-dien-30-oate (CDODA-Me) and the corresponding 2-trifluoromethyl analog (CF(3)DODA-Me) are derived synthetically from the triterpenoid glycyrrhetinic acid, a major component of licorice. CDODA-Me and CF(3)DODA-Me inhibited growth of highly invasive ARO, DRO, K-18, and HTh-74 thyroid cancer cells and this was due, in part, to decreased expression of specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 that are overexpressed in these cells. CDODA-Me and CF(3)DODA-Me also decreased expression of Sp-dependent genes, such as survivin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and induced apoptosis. In addition, pituitary tumor-transforming gene-1 (PTTG-1) protein and mRNA levels were also decreased in thyroid cancer cells treated with CDODA-Me or CF(3)DODA-Me and this was accompanied by decreased expression of PTTG-1-dependent c-Myc and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) genes. RNA interference studies against Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 proteins showed that in thyroid cancer cells, PTTG-1 was an Sp-dependent gene. This study demonstrates for the first time that drugs, such as CDODA-Me and CF(3)DODA-Me, that decrease Sp protein expression also downregulate PTTG-1 in thyroid cancer cells and therefore have potential for clinical treatment of thyroid cancer and other endocrine neoplasias where PTTG-1 is a major pro-oncogenic factor.",Journal Article,3283.0,29.0,"Methyl 2-cyano-3,11-dioxo-18β-olean-1,12-dien-30-oate CDODA-Me and the corresponding 2-trifluoromethyl analog CF 3 DODA-Me are derived synthetically from the triterpenoid glycyrrhetinic acid a major component of licorice CDODA-Me and CF 3 DODA-Me inhibited growth of highly invasive ARO DRO K-18 and HTh-74 cancer cells and this was due in part to decreased expression of specificity protein Sp transcription factors Sp1 Sp3 and Sp4 that are overexpressed in these cells CDODA-Me and CF 3 DODA-Me also decreased expression of Sp-dependent genes such as survivin and vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF and induced apoptosis In addition tumor-transforming gene-1 PTTG-1 protein and mRNA levels were also decreased in cancer cells treated with CDODA-Me or CF 3 DODA-Me and this was accompanied by decreased expression of PTTG-1-dependent c-Myc and fibroblast growth factor-2 FGF-2 genes RNA interference studies against Sp1 Sp3 and Sp4 proteins showed that in cancer cells PTTG-1 was an Sp-dependent gene This study demonstrates for the first time that drugs such as CDODA-Me and CF 3 DODA-Me that decrease Sp protein expression also downregulate PTTG-1 in cancer cells and therefore have potential for clinical treatment of cancer and other endocrine neoplasias where PTTG-1 is a major pro-oncogenic factor",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[5228, 18, 11777, 27, 175, 39533, 59758, 46425, 14, 133, 13030, 201, 33338, 17477, 4816, 2, 3, 1734, 18, 34019, 3497, 5729, 27, 27022, 4816, 32, 526, 24475, 29, 3, 15818, 59759, 971, 8, 458, 1249, 1, 59760, 17477, 4816, 2, 5729, 27, 27022, 4816, 879, 129, 1, 561, 416, 19613, 28365, 1634, 203, 2, 59761, 794, 12, 37, 2, 26, 10, 520, 4, 760, 6, 340, 55, 1, 1121, 178, 4074, 866, 130, 5557, 13919, 2, 19072, 17, 32, 1711, 4, 46, 37, 17477, 4816, 2, 5729, 27, 27022, 4816, 120, 340, 55, 1, 4074, 470, 214, 225, 22, 3160, 2, 756, 845, 129, 161, 618, 2, 277, 351, 4, 352, 30, 3621, 145, 14, 31737, 14, 178, 2, 956, 148, 11, 120, 340, 4, 12, 37, 73, 5, 17477, 4816, 15, 5729, 27, 27022, 4816, 2, 26, 10, 2756, 20, 340, 55, 1, 31737, 14, 470, 256, 1371, 2, 3758, 129, 161, 18, 6517, 18, 214, 893, 3182, 94, 480, 5557, 13919, 2, 19072, 652, 224, 17, 4, 12, 37, 31737, 14, 10, 35, 4074, 470, 145, 26, 45, 1902, 9, 3, 157, 98, 17, 600, 225, 22, 17477, 4816, 2, 5729, 27, 27022, 4816, 17, 775, 4074, 178, 55, 120, 10261, 31737, 14, 4, 12, 37, 2, 673, 47, 174, 9, 38, 24, 1, 12, 2, 127, 1293, 8235, 1257, 31737, 14, 16, 8, 458, 1805, 1302, 161]",1309.0,21268135,114
The most commonly occurring papillary thyroid cancer in the United States is now a microcarcinoma in a patient older than 45 years.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2011-01-26,"The incidence of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is growing at a faster rate than any other malignancy. However, it is unknown what effect age is having on the changing PTC incidence rates. With the goal of understanding the role of age in thyroid cancer incidence, this study analyzes the changing demographics of patients with PTC over the past three decades. This was a retrospective evaluation of the incidence rates of PTC from 1973 to 2006 reported by the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. From 1973-2006 the age group most commonly found to have PTC has shifted from patients in their 30s to patients in the 40-50-year-old age group. In 1973 60% of PTC cases were found in patients younger than 45, and the majority of cases continued to occur in younger patients until 1999. After 1999 PTC became more common in patients older than 45 years, and in 2006, 61% of PTC cases were in patients older than 45 years. From 1988 to 2003 there has been an increasing incidence of all sizes of PTC in all age groups with the largest increase in tumors <1 cm in patients older than 45. Forty-three percent of tumors in patients older than 45 are now <1 cm, whereas only 34% are <1 cm in patients younger than 45. Of the nearly 20,000 thyroid cancer cases in 2003, 24% were microcarcinomas in patients over the age of 45. The incidence of PTC is increasing disproportionally in patients older than 45 years. The number of PTC tumors smaller than 1 cm is increasing in all age groups, and now the most commonly found PTC tumor in the United States is a microcarcinoma in a patient older than 45 years.

Inhibition of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and RET kinase pathways with the combination of the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib and the farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib in medullary and differentiated thyroid malignancies.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2011-02-02,"Ras/Raf/MAPK kinase/ERK and rearranged in transformation (RET) kinase pathways are important in thyroid cancer. We tested sorafenib, a B-Raf, RET, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor, combined with tipifarnib, a farnesyltransferase inhibitor that inactivates Ras and other farnesylated proteins. We treated 35 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) in a phase I trial. Sorafenib and tipifarnib were given for 21 d with 7 d rest in each 28-d cycle. We enrolled 22 patients with metastatic DTC (16 papillary, five follicular, and one poorly differentiated) and 13 patients with MTC, of whom 15 with DTC and 10 with MTC reached first restaging. When tissue was available, eight of 15 DTC patients (53%) had B-Raf mutations; eight of 13 MTC (61.5%) patients had RET mutations. MTC partial response rate was 38% (five of 13) (duration = 9+, 12, 13, 16+, and 34+ months), stable disease of at least 6 months was 31% (four of 13). The DTC partial response rate was 4.5% (one of 22), and stable disease of at least 6 months was 36% (eight of 22). Median progression-free survival for all 35 patients was 18 months (95% confidence interval, 14.6 to not reached months).

Recurrence-free interval and overall, disease-specific, and recurrence-free survival. There were 112 male and 219 female patients, with a median age of 44.7 years (range, 11-87 years). The median follow-up time for the series was 77.9 months (range, 12.7-148.7 months). Preoperative US abnormalities were found in the right neck in 13.3%, in the left neck in 12.3%, and bilaterally in 11.2%; all of these patients underwent a lateral neck dissection at the time of the thyroidectomy. There were 11 recurrences in the series (0.3%), with a median time to presentation of 22.8 months (range, 6.0-55.3 months). Predictors of lateral neck disease-free interval were T stage and distant disease at presentation (P = .01 and P < .001, respectively) and the sonographic status of the ipsilateral and central neck (P = .001 and P < .001). The number of abnormal neck compartments in US correlated with the risk of regional failure (P = .01). The presence of US abnormalities in the lateral neck decreased the 10-year disease-specific survival from 98.3% to 66.9% (P < .001).

Analysis of prevalence and degree of macrocephaly in patients with germline PTEN mutations and of brain weight in Pten knock-in murine model.,European journal of human genetics : EJHG,Eur. J. Hum. Genet.,2011-02-23,"PTEN Hamartoma Tumour Syndrome (PHTS) includes Cowden syndrome (CS), Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), and other conditions resulting from germline mutation of the PTEN tumour suppressor gene. Although macrocephaly, presumably due to megencephaly, is found in both CS and BRRS, the prevalence and degree have not been formally assessed in PHTS. We evaluated head size in a prospective nested series of 181 patients found to have pathogenic germline PTEN mutations. Clinical data including occipital-frontal circumference (OFC) measurement were requested for all participants. Macrocephaly was present in 94% of 161 evaluable PHTS individuals. In patients ≤ 18 years, mean OFC was +4.89 standard deviations (SD) above the population mean with no difference between genders (P = 0.7). Among patients >18 years, average OFC was 60.0 cm in females and 62.8 cm in males (P < 0.0001). To systematically determine whether macrocephaly was due to megencephaly, we examined Pten(M3M4) missense mutant mice generated and maintained on mixed backgrounds. Mice were killed at various ages, brains were dissected out and weighed. Average brain weight for Pten(M3M4) homozygous mice (N = 15) was 1.02 g compared with 0.57 g for heterozygous mice (N = 29) and 0.49 g for wild-type littermates (N = 24) (P < 0.0001). Macrocephaly, secondary to megencephaly, is an important component of PHTS and more prevalent than previously appreciated. Patients with PHTS have increased risks for breast and thyroid cancers, and early diagnosis is key to initiating timely screening to reduce patient morbidity and mortality.

The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of PTEN mutations in an unselected group of patients with DTC and to identify whether additional clinical features might indicate the need for referral for genetic counseling and possible testing. We collected personal medical and family history information, head circumference data, and blood from 259 consecutively identified clinic-based patients with DTC, unselected for personal or family history. Individuals were categorized for diagnostic criteria for Cowden syndrome (CS) using the 2009 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines and underwent germline PTEN mutation analysis. Two of the 259 patients (0.8%), with both follicular thyroid carcinoma and macrocephaly, were found to carry a germline mutation in the PTEN gene. The PTEN mutation frequency in unselected cases of follicular thyroid carcinoma was 4.8%.

Rising incidence of second cancers in patients with low-risk (T1N0) thyroid cancer who receive radioactive iodine therapy.,Cancer,Cancer,2011-03-22,"American Thyroid Association guidelines currently recommend the selective use of radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy in patients with well differentiated thyroid cancer (WDTC). Despite these guidelines, RAI ablation has been used routinely in all but the very lowest risk patients with thyroid cancer over the last 30 years. The objective of this study was to evaluate patterns of RAI use and elevated risk of secondary primary malignancies (SPM) in patients with low-risk (T1N0) WDTC. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was used to analyze trends in RAI use over time in the United States. To determine the excess risk of SPM, the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and excess absolute risk (EAR) of various cancers were calculated in the 2 cohorts. Between 1973 and 2007, 37,176 patients with WDTC were followed in the SEER Program, equating to 408,750 person-years at risk (PYR). In total, 14,589 patients received RAI, and SPMs were observed in 3223 patients. During the study period, the rate of RAI use in patients with low-risk (T1N0) WDTC increased from 3.3% to 38.1%. For low-risk patients, the SIR of SPM was 1.21 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93-1.54), and the EAR was 4.6 excess cases per 10,000 PYR. SPM with significantly elevated risk because of RAI were salivary gland malignancies (SIR = 11.13; 95% CI, 1.35-40.2) and leukemia (SIR = 5.68; 95% CI, 2.09-12.37). The excess risk of leukemia was significantly greater in patients aged <45 years (SIR = 5.32; 95% CI, 2.75-9.30) compared with the excess risk in older patients (SIR = 2.26; 95% CI, 1.43-3.39). The increased risk of a SPM in patients with low-risk (T1N0) WDTC, along with a lack of data demonstrating improved survival outcomes with adjuvant RAI, provide a compelling argument in favor of rationing the use of RAI in this patient population.",Journal Article,3227.0,190.0,"American Association guidelines currently recommend the selective use of radioactive iodine RAI therapy in patients with well differentiated cancer WDTC Despite these guidelines RAI ablation has been used routinely in all but the very lowest risk patients with cancer over the last 30 years The objective of this study was to evaluate patterns of RAI use and elevated risk of secondary primary malignancies SPM in patients with low-risk T1N0 WDTC The Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER database was used to analyze trends in RAI use over time in the United States To determine the excess risk of SPM the standardized incidence ratio SIR and excess absolute risk EAR of various cancers were calculated in the 2 cohorts Between 1973 and 2007 37,176 patients with WDTC were followed in the SEER Program equating to 408,750 person-years at risk PYR In total 14,589 patients received RAI and SPMs were observed in 3223 patients During the study period the rate of RAI use in patients with low-risk T1N0 WDTC increased from 3.3 to 38.1 For low-risk patients the SIR of SPM was 1.21 95 confidence interval CI 0.93-1.54 and the EAR was 4.6 excess cases per 10,000 PYR SPM with significantly elevated risk because of RAI were gland malignancies SIR 11.13 95 CI 1.35-40.2 and SIR 5.68 95 CI 2.09-12.37 The excess risk of was significantly greater in patients aged 45 years SIR 5.32 95 CI 2.75-9.30 compared with the excess risk in older patients SIR 2.26 95 CI 1.43-3.39 The increased risk of a SPM in patients with low-risk T1N0 WDTC along with a lack of data demonstrating improved survival outcomes with adjuvant RAI provide a compelling argument in favor of rationing the use of RAI in this patient population",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[597, 248, 677, 694, 2237, 3, 1094, 119, 1, 4741, 4287, 4121, 36, 4, 7, 5, 149, 1442, 12, 14663, 550, 46, 677, 4121, 1650, 71, 85, 95, 3066, 4, 62, 84, 3, 923, 2101, 43, 7, 5, 12, 252, 3, 1060, 201, 60, 3, 461, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 376, 764, 1, 4121, 119, 2, 804, 43, 1, 568, 86, 441, 8208, 4, 7, 5, 154, 43, 13404, 14663, 3, 617, 1284, 2, 396, 99, 1605, 609, 10, 95, 6, 1992, 1963, 4, 4121, 119, 252, 98, 4, 3, 1088, 907, 6, 223, 3, 2612, 43, 1, 8208, 3, 1670, 287, 197, 3636, 2, 2612, 1766, 43, 7815, 1, 747, 163, 11, 981, 4, 3, 18, 736, 59, 4756, 2, 1307, 567, 5800, 7, 5, 14663, 11, 370, 4, 3, 1605, 1243, 31779, 6, 13356, 4506, 2719, 60, 28, 43, 17475, 4, 181, 213, 11858, 7, 103, 4121, 2, 14029, 11, 164, 4, 59961, 7, 190, 3, 45, 727, 3, 116, 1, 4121, 119, 4, 7, 5, 154, 43, 13404, 14663, 101, 29, 27, 27, 6, 519, 14, 9, 154, 43, 7, 3, 3636, 1, 8208, 10, 14, 239, 48, 307, 268, 58, 13, 966, 14, 667, 2, 3, 7815, 10, 39, 49, 2612, 140, 379, 79, 984, 17475, 8208, 5, 97, 804, 43, 408, 1, 4121, 11, 2326, 441, 3636, 175, 233, 48, 58, 14, 465, 327, 18, 2, 3636, 33, 806, 48, 58, 18, 1730, 133, 567, 3, 2612, 43, 1, 10, 97, 378, 4, 7, 1032, 512, 60, 3636, 33, 531, 48, 58, 18, 481, 83, 201, 72, 5, 3, 2612, 43, 4, 434, 7, 3636, 18, 432, 48, 58, 14, 601, 27, 587, 3, 101, 43, 1, 8, 8208, 4, 7, 5, 154, 43, 13404, 14663, 1510, 5, 8, 926, 1, 74, 2219, 231, 25, 123, 5, 249, 4121, 377, 8, 6051, 17140, 4, 4283, 1, 29133, 3, 119, 1, 4121, 4, 26, 69, 266]",1715.0,21432843,171
Central neck dissection for papillary thyroid cancer.,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,Cancer Control,2011-04-01,"Central compartment lymph node dissection is a common adjunct to thyroidectomy in the treatment of papillary thyroid cancer. The indications, surgical technique, potential benefits, and operative risks of this procedure should be clearly defined in order to provide optimal care to these patients. A systematic review of the literature and an analysis of evidence-based recommendations were performed regarding central neck node dissection for patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma. Cervical nodal metastasis in papillary thyroid cancer is a common occurrence. The presence of metastasis is associated with increased recurrence rates and may decrease survival. Detection of central and lateral neck nodal metastasis preoperatively with clinical examination and cervical ultrasound is important in determining the appropriate initial surgical management. Level VI neck dissection and central neck dissection are terms often used interchangeably to describe surgical excision of all lymph nodes from the hyoid bone to the sternal notch between the carotid arteries, but the addition of the superior mediastinal lymph nodes in compartment VII should be included in the central neck dissection. Due to improved recurrence rates and survival, therapeutic central neck dissection is recommended for all patients with nodal involvement detected pre- or intraoperatively. Prophylactic central neck dissection in patients without detectable nodal disease remains a controversial topic due to a lack of definitive evidence of improved recurrence rates or survival and the possibility of higher complication rates compared to total thyroidectomy alone. Reoperative central nodal dissection can be a challenging procedure with increased complication rates but with good outcomes in experienced centers. Central neck lymph node dissection plays an important role in the appropriate treatment of papillary thyroid cancer at initial presentation and in cases of recurrent disease.

Targeted therapies for thyroid tumors.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2011-04-01,"Systemic chemotherapies for advanced or metastatic thyroid carcinomas have been of only limited effectiveness. For patients with differentiated or medullary carcinomas unresponsive to conventional treatments, novel therapies are needed to improve disease outcomes. Multiple novel therapies primarily targeting angiogenesis have entered clinical trials for metastatic thyroid carcinoma. Partial response rates up to 30% have been reported in single-agent studies, but prolonged disease stabilization is more commonly observed. The most successful agents target the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, with potential targets including the mutant kinases associated with papillary and medullary oncogenesis. Two drugs approved for other malignancies, sorafenib and sunitinib, have had promising preliminary results reported, and are being used selectively for patients who do not qualify for clinical trials. At least one randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trial has been successfully completed, showing improved progression-free survival in patients with advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma treated with vandetanib.

Sunitinib in metastatic renal cell carcinoma: recommendations for management of noncardiovascular toxicities.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2011-04-13,"The multitargeted tyrosine-kinase inhibitor sunitinib has emerged as one of the standards of care for good- and intermediate-risk metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Although generally associated with acceptable toxicity, sunitinib exhibits a novel and distinct toxicity profile that requires monitoring and management. Fatigue, diarrhea, anorexia, oral changes, hand-foot syndrome and other skin toxicity, thyroid dysfunction, myelotoxicity, and hypertension seem to be the most common and clinically relevant toxicities of sunitinib. Drug dosing and treatment duration are correlated with response to treatment and survival. Treatment recommendations for hypertension have been published but, currently, no standard guidelines exist for the management of noncardiovascular side effects. To discuss the optimal management of noncardiovascular side effects, an international, interdisciplinary panel of experts gathered in November 2009. Existing literature on incidence, severity, and underlying mechanisms of side effects as well as on potential treatment options were carefully reviewed and discussed. On the basis of these proceedings and the thorough review of the existing literature, recommendations were made for the monitoring, prevention, and treatment of the most common noncardiovascular side effects and are summarized in this review.

Patterns of extralaryngeal spread of laryngeal cancer: thyroid cartilage penetration occurs in a minority of patients with extralaryngeal spread of laryngeal squamous cell cancers.,Cancer,Cancer,2011-04-26,"Laryngeal preservation programs for patients with advanced laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) have generally excluded patients with T4 disease. The accuracy of preoperative imaging in evaluating thyroid cartilage penetration and extralaryngeal spread (ELS) has previously been questioned. Clinically, SCC spread into noncartilaginous structures may have less of a functional impact when compared with thyroid cartilage penetration. The current study was designed to characterize and quantify the routes and frequency of ELS. A total of 103 laryngectomy specimens with preoperative contrast-enhanced neck computed tomography scans were coded according to the observed extent of disease by pathological and radiological data. Previously irradiated tumors or those of pyriform sinus origin were omitted. Routes of spread were categorized as anterior (thyroid cartilage penetration), posterior (arytenoid cartilage destruction and thyroarytenoid space widening), inferior (conus elasticus penetration), and superior (base of tongue, thyrohyoid membrane or thyroid notch penetration involvement). Sixty-three cases of ELS were identified. Anterior spread by thyroid cartilage penetration occurred in 44% of all instances of ELS, followed by both inferior and posterior spread each representing 33% of ELS cases. Superior spread occurred with a frequency of 24%. Although thyroid cartilage penetration is a common route of ELS of glottic and supraglottic SCC, ELS into surrounding structures with thyroid cartilage penetration was found to occur in only 44% of the cases of ELS in the current study. As illustrated, advanced SCC spreads in a variety of pathways. Once these patterns are better understood and identified at the time of initial evaluation, subgroups of patients with ELS who may still be candidates for laryngeal preservation may be identified.",Journal Article,3192.0,15.0,preservation programs for patients with advanced squamous cell carcinomas SCC have generally excluded patients with T4 disease The accuracy of preoperative imaging in evaluating cartilage penetration and extralaryngeal spread ELS has previously been questioned Clinically SCC spread into noncartilaginous structures may have less of a functional impact when compared with cartilage penetration The current study was designed to characterize and quantify the routes and frequency of ELS A total of 103 laryngectomy specimens with preoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans were coded according to the observed extent of disease by pathological and radiological data Previously irradiated tumors or those of pyriform sinus origin were omitted Routes of spread were categorized as anterior cartilage penetration posterior arytenoid cartilage destruction and thyroarytenoid space widening inferior conus elasticus penetration and superior base of tongue thyrohyoid membrane or notch penetration involvement Sixty-three cases of ELS were identified Anterior spread by cartilage penetration occurred in 44 of all instances of ELS followed by both inferior and posterior spread each representing 33 of ELS cases Superior spread occurred with a frequency of 24 Although cartilage penetration is a common route of ELS of glottic and supraglottic SCC ELS into surrounding structures with cartilage penetration was found to occur in only 44 of the cases of ELS in the current study As illustrated advanced SCC spreads in a variety of pathways Once these patterns are better understood and identified at the time of initial evaluation subgroups of patients with ELS who may still be candidates for preservation may be identified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[2224, 2251, 9, 7, 5, 131, 691, 31, 826, 1791, 47, 1228, 1800, 7, 5, 2463, 34, 3, 1190, 1, 498, 270, 4, 1435, 8977, 4618, 2, 45575, 2579, 23909, 71, 373, 85, 9089, 505, 1791, 2579, 237, 31801, 2414, 68, 47, 299, 1, 8, 583, 345, 198, 72, 5, 8977, 4618, 3, 291, 45, 10, 1114, 6, 1507, 2, 3091, 3, 9421, 2, 675, 1, 23909, 8, 181, 1, 3283, 8391, 623, 5, 498, 748, 651, 1220, 872, 1441, 11, 8259, 768, 6, 3, 164, 1039, 1, 34, 20, 1301, 2, 4298, 74, 373, 2398, 57, 15, 135, 1, 60075, 5810, 1938, 11, 7138, 9421, 1, 2579, 11, 2320, 22, 2882, 8977, 4618, 3028, 46551, 8977, 4572, 2, 60076, 3865, 23486, 1663, 39627, 60077, 4618, 2, 1123, 1782, 1, 4391, 60078, 1905, 15, 3193, 4618, 799, 1746, 169, 140, 1, 23909, 11, 108, 2882, 2579, 20, 8977, 4618, 489, 4, 584, 1, 62, 5342, 1, 23909, 370, 20, 110, 1663, 2, 3028, 2579, 296, 2861, 466, 1, 23909, 140, 1123, 2579, 489, 5, 8, 675, 1, 259, 242, 8977, 4618, 16, 8, 186, 5841, 1, 23909, 1, 12152, 2, 16325, 1791, 23909, 237, 2976, 2414, 5, 8977, 4618, 10, 204, 6, 1271, 4, 158, 584, 1, 3, 140, 1, 23909, 4, 3, 291, 45, 22, 8508, 131, 1791, 16743, 4, 8, 1362, 1, 460, 1059, 46, 764, 32, 380, 1784, 2, 108, 28, 3, 98, 1, 388, 451, 1453, 1, 7, 5, 23909, 54, 68, 1234, 40, 1931, 9, 2224, 68, 40, 108]",1730.0,21523761,200

"Activity of XL184 (Cabozantinib), an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with medullary thyroid cancer.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2011-05-23,"XL184 (cabozantinib) is a potent inhibitor of MET, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), and RET, with robust antiangiogenic, antitumor, and anti-invasive effects in preclinical models. Early observations of clinical benefit in a phase I study of cabozantinib, which included patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), led to expansion of an MTC-enriched cohort, which is the focus of this article. A phase I dose-escalation study of oral cabozantinib was conducted in patients with advanced solid tumors. Primary end points included evaluation of safety, pharmacokinetics, and maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) determination. Additional end points included RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) response, pharmacodynamics, RET mutational status, and biomarker analyses. Eighty-five patients were enrolled, including 37 with MTC. The MTD was 175 mg daily. Dose-limiting toxicities were grade 3 palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), mucositis, and AST, ALT, and lipase elevations and grade 2 mucositis that resulted in dose interruption and reduction. Ten (29%) of 35 patients with MTC with measurable disease had a confirmed partial response. Overall, 18 patients experienced tumor shrinkage of 30% or more, including 17 (49%) of 35 patients with MTC with measurable disease. Additionally, 15 (41%) of 37 patients with MTC had stable disease (SD) for at least 6 months, resulting in SD for 6 months or longer or confirmed partial response in 68% of patients with MTC.

Clinical outcomes and contributors to weight loss in a cancer cachexia clinic.,Journal of palliative medicine,J Palliat Med,2011-07-27,"Cancer cachexia is considered intractable, with few therapeutic options. Secondary nutrition impact symptoms (S-NIS) such as nausea may further contribute to weight loss by decreasing nutrient intake. In addition, treatable metabolic abnormalities such as hypogonadism, vitamin B12 deficiency, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism could exacerbate anorexia and muscle wasting in patients with cancer cachexia. We determined the frequency and type of contributors to appetite and weight loss, and the effect of the cachexia clinic on clinical outcomes. Review of 151 consecutive patients referred to a cachexia clinic. All received dietary counseling and exercise recommendations. Assessments included weight, body mass index (BMI), S-NIS, resting energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry, serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), cortisol, total testosterone, and vitamin B12. Median weight loss in the 100 days before referral was 9% (4%-13%); median BMI at presentation was 20.8. Median number of S-NIS was 3 (2-4), most commonly treated by metoclopramide, laxatives, and antidepressants. Forty-one percent (24/59) of patients were hypermetabolic and 73% (52/71) of males hypogonadic, whereas hypoadrenalism (0/101, 0%), hypothyroidism (4/113, 4%), and low vitamin B12 (3/107, 3%) were uncommon. Poor appetite and weight loss before referral (r = 0.18, p = 0.036) were associated with increased S-NIS (r = 0.22, p = 0.008).

Targeting oncogenic BRAF in human cancer.,Current topics in microbiology and immunology,Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol.,2012-01-01,"Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway activation is a frequent event in human cancer and is often the result of activating mutations in the BRAF and RAS oncogenes. BRAF missense mutations, the vast majority of which are V600E, occur in approximately 8% of human tumors. These kinase domain mutations, which are non-overlapping in distribution with RAS mutations, are observed most frequently in melanoma but are also common in tumors arising in the colon, thyroid, lung, and other sites. Supporting its classification as an oncogene, (V600E)BRAF stimulates ERK signaling, induces proliferation, and is capable of promoting transformation. Given the frequent occurrence of BRAF mutations in human cancer and the continued requirement for BRAF activity in the tumors in which it is mutated, efforts are underway to develop targeted inhibitors of BRAF and its downstream effectors. These agents offer the possibility of greater efficacy and less toxicity than the systemic therapies currently available for tumors driven by activating mutations of MAPK pathway components.

"Rationale and design of decision: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of sorafenib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory, differentiated thyroid cancer.",BMC cancer,BMC Cancer,2011-08-11,"The incidence of thyroid cancer and the number of patients who die from this disease are increasing globally. Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is the histologic subtype present in most patients and is primarily responsible for the increased overall incidence of thyroid cancer. Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that targets several molecular signals believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of thyroid cancer, including those implicated in DTC. In phase II studies of patients with DTC, sorafenib treatment has yielded a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 58 to 84 weeks and disease control rates of 59% to 100%. The DECISION trial was designed to assess the ability of sorafenib to improve PFS in patients with locally advanced or metastatic, radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory DTC. DECISION is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase III study in patients with locally advanced/metastatic RAI-refractory DTC. Study treatment will continue until radiographically documented disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance, or withdrawal of consent. Efficacy will be evaluated every 56 days (2 cycles), whereas safety will be evaluated every 28 days (1 cycle) for the first 8 months and every 56 days thereafter. Following disease progression, patients may continue or start sorafenib, depending on whether they were randomized to receive sorafenib or placebo, at investigator discretion. Patients originally randomized to receive sorafenib will be followed up every 3 months for overall survival (OS); patients originally randomized to receive placebo will be followed up every month for 8 months after cross-over to sorafenib. The duration of the trial is expected to be 30 months from the time the first patient is randomized until the planned number of PFS events is attained. The primary endpoint is PFS; secondary endpoints include OS, time to disease progression, disease control rate, response rate, duration of response, safety, and pharmacokinetic analysis. The DECISION study has been designed to test whether sorafenib improves PFS in patients with locally advanced or metastatic RAI-refractory DTC.

Subtyping of non-small cell lung carcinoma: a comparison of small biopsy and cytology specimens.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2011-11-01,"There is growing evidence that lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC) have distinct oncogenic mutations and divergent therapeutic responses, which is driving the heightened emphasis on accurate pathologic subtyping of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The relative feasibility and accuracy of NSCLC subtyping by small biopsy versus cytology is not well established, particularly in current practice where immunohistochemistry (IHC) is becoming routinely used to aid in this distinction. Concurrent biopsy and cytology specimens obtained during a single procedure and diagnosed as NSCLC during a 2-year period (n = 101) were reviewed. Concordance of diagnoses in the two methods was assessed. Accuracy was determined based on subsequent resection or autopsy diagnosis (n = 21) or IHC for thyroid transcription factor 1 and p63 on a subset of cases (n = 43). The distribution of definitive versus favored versus unclassified categories (reflecting the degree of diagnostic certainty) was similar for biopsy (71% versus 23% versus 6%, respectively) and cytology (69% versus 19% versus 12%, respectively), p = 0.29. When results from paired specimens were combined, the rate of definitive diagnoses by at least one method was increased to 84% and the unclassified rate was decreased to 4%. NSCLC subtype concordance between biopsy and cytology was 93%. Kappa coefficient (95% confidence interval) for agreement between methods was 0.88 (0.60-0.89) for adenocarcinoma and 0.76 (0.63-0.89) for SQCC. In pairs with discordant diagnoses (n = 7) the correct tumor type was identified with a similar frequency by biopsy (n = 4) and cytology (n = 3). Factors contributing to mistyping were poor differentiation, necrosis, low cellularity, and lack of supporting IHC. All concordant diagnoses for which verification was available (n = 57) were correct. IHC was used more frequently to subtype NSCLC in biopsy than cytology (32% versus 6%; p = 0.0001).

Malignancies occurring during therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and other hematologic malignancies.,Blood,Blood,2011-08-16,"Success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has given patients hope for a long disease-free-survival. A longer survival raises the question of late effects, including development of another malignancy.

The number of second cancers was compared with the number expected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. After a median follow-up of 107 months (range, 13-362 months) after CML/myeloproliferative neoplasm diagnosis, 66 patients (4.6%) developed 80 second cancers, including skin (31%), prostate (15%), melanoma (13%), digestive system (10%), kidney (4%), thyroid (4%), breast (3%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (3%), hepatobiliary (3%), and other cancers (14%).

The rearranged during transfection/papillary thyroid carcinoma tyrosine kinase is an estrogen-dependent gene required for the growth of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells.,Breast cancer research and treatment,Breast Cancer Res. Treat.,2011-09-24,"The rearranged during transfection/papillary thyroid carcinoma (RET/PTC) tyrosine kinase is an oncogene implicated in the tumorigenesis of thyroid cancer. Recent studies by us and others have shown that RET/PTC kinase expression is induced by estrogen in breast cancer cells. Due to the critical involvement of estrogen-regulated genes in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, we investigated the expression, regulation, and function of RET/PTC kinase in breast cancer cells. We found that RET/PTC kinase expression correlates with estrogen receptor (ER) expression in breast cancer cells and tumor specimens, and that RET/PTC kinase expression is associated with a poor prognosis in ER-positive breast cancer patients. We found that estrogen rapidly induces RET/PTC kinase expression in an ER-dependent manner in breast cancer cells and that this induction is through a transcriptional regulatory mechanism. Using reporter assays, small interfering RNA (siRNA) assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we demonstrated the necessity of crosstalk between ER and the forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) transcription factor in regulating RET/PTC kinase expression. In functional studies, increased expression of RET/PTC kinase induced by estrogen stimulation resulted in elevated phosphorylation of multiple downstream kinase signaling pathways. Conversely, knockdown of RET/PTC expression was associated with the inhibition of these same kinase signaling pathways, and, in fact, decreased the stimulatory effect of estrogen on the proliferation of ER-positive breast cancer cells. These results demonstrate a novel pathway of ER and FOXA1 transcription factor crosstalk in regulating RET/PTC kinase expression, and demonstrate that RET/PTC kinase is a critical regulator for the proliferation of ER-positive breast cancer cells. Taken together, our study suggests that RET/PTC kinase may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for prevention and treatment of ER-positive breast cancer.",Journal Article,3041.0,23.0,The rearranged during transfection/papillary carcinoma RET/PTC tyrosine kinase is an oncogene implicated in the tumorigenesis of cancer Recent studies by us and others have shown that RET/PTC kinase expression is induced by estrogen in cancer cells Due to the critical involvement of estrogen-regulated genes in the pathogenesis of cancer we investigated the expression regulation and function of RET/PTC kinase in cancer cells We found that RET/PTC kinase expression correlates with estrogen receptor ER expression in cancer cells and tumor specimens and that RET/PTC kinase expression is associated with a poor prognosis in ER-positive cancer patients We found that estrogen rapidly induces RET/PTC kinase expression in an ER-dependent manner in cancer cells and that this induction is through a transcriptional regulatory mechanism Using reporter assays small interfering RNA siRNA assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP assays we demonstrated the necessity of crosstalk between ER and the forkhead box A1 FOXA1 transcription factor in regulating RET/PTC kinase expression In functional studies increased expression of RET/PTC kinase induced by estrogen stimulation resulted in elevated phosphorylation of multiple downstream kinase signaling pathways Conversely knockdown of RET/PTC expression was associated with the inhibition of these same kinase signaling pathways and in fact decreased the stimulatory effect of estrogen on the proliferation of ER-positive cancer cells These results demonstrate a novel pathway of ER and FOXA1 transcription factor crosstalk in regulating RET/PTC kinase expression and demonstrate that RET/PTC kinase is a critical regulator for the proliferation of ER-positive cancer cells Taken together our study suggests that RET/PTC kinase may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for prevention and treatment of ER-positive cancer,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[3, 3201, 190, 3789, 1796, 134, 2412, 3748, 564, 216, 16, 35, 1836, 1771, 4, 3, 1565, 1, 12, 435, 94, 20, 843, 2, 1749, 47, 443, 17, 2412, 3748, 216, 55, 16, 277, 20, 808, 4, 12, 37, 520, 6, 3, 740, 799, 1, 808, 1065, 214, 4, 3, 1384, 1, 12, 21, 565, 3, 55, 863, 2, 343, 1, 2412, 3748, 216, 4, 12, 37, 21, 204, 17, 2412, 3748, 216, 55, 1871, 5, 808, 153, 516, 55, 4, 12, 37, 2, 30, 623, 2, 17, 2412, 3748, 216, 55, 16, 41, 5, 8, 334, 356, 4, 516, 109, 12, 7, 21, 204, 17, 808, 1755, 1516, 2412, 3748, 216, 55, 4, 35, 516, 470, 1708, 4, 12, 37, 2, 17, 26, 504, 16, 298, 8, 1431, 1253, 670, 75, 3674, 1013, 302, 3449, 893, 1919, 1013, 2, 2287, 4857, 4222, 1013, 21, 264, 3, 7378, 1, 8119, 59, 516, 2, 3, 8106, 4971, 6044, 7513, 866, 161, 4, 2681, 2412, 3748, 216, 55, 4, 583, 94, 101, 55, 1, 2412, 3748, 216, 277, 20, 808, 2503, 627, 4, 804, 982, 1, 232, 1489, 216, 314, 460, 3154, 1563, 1, 2412, 3748, 55, 10, 41, 5, 3, 297, 1, 46, 827, 216, 314, 460, 2, 4, 1991, 340, 3, 6708, 254, 1, 808, 23, 3, 457, 1, 516, 109, 12, 37, 46, 99, 608, 8, 229, 308, 1, 516, 2, 7513, 866, 161, 8119, 4, 2681, 2412, 3748, 216, 55, 2, 608, 17, 2412, 3748, 216, 16, 8, 740, 2452, 9, 3, 457, 1, 516, 109, 12, 37, 1633, 1162, 114, 45, 844, 17, 2412, 3748, 216, 68, 1833, 22, 8, 229, 177, 901, 2, 189, 283, 9, 1070, 2, 24, 1, 516, 109, 12]",1894.0,21947652,3
"Incidence and clinical characteristics of thyroid cancer in prospective series of individuals with Cowden and Cowden-like syndrome characterized by germline PTEN, SDH, or KLLN alterations.",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2011-09-28,"Thyroid cancer is believed to be an important component of Cowden syndrome (CS). Germline PTEN and SDHx mutations and KLLN epimutation cause CS and CS-like phenotypes. Despite the established association, little is known about the incidence and clinical features of thyroid cancer found in CS/CS-like patients. The aim of the study was to compare incidence, clinical, and histological characteristics of epithelial thyroid cancers in CS/CS-like individuals, in the context of PTEN, SDHx, and KLLN status. The study encompassed a 5-yr, multicenter, prospective accrual of 2723 CS and CS-like patients, all of whom had comprehensive PTEN analysis. SDHx mutation analysis occurred in those without PTEN mutations/variations and elevated manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) levels. KLLN epimutation analysis was performed in the subset without any PTEN or SDHx mutation/deletion/ variant/polymorphism. Gene-specific thyroid cancer histologies, demographic and clinical information, and adjusted standardized incidence rates were studied. Of 2723 CS/CS-like patients, 664 had thyroid cancer. Standardized incidence rates for thyroid cancer were 72 [95% confidence interval (CI), 51-99; P < 0.001] for pathogenic PTEN mutations, 63 (95% CI, 42-92; P < 0.001) for SDHx variants, and 45 (95% CI, 26-73; P < 0.001) for KLLN epimutations. All six (16.7%) diagnosed under age 18 yr carried pathogenic PTEN mutations. Follicular thyroid cancer was overrepresented in PTEN mutation-positive cases compared to those with SDHx and KLLN alterations. PTEN frameshift mutations were found in 31% of patients with thyroid cancer compared to 17% in those without thyroid cancer.

Preliminary report: vitamin D deficiency in advanced cancer patients with symptoms of fatigue or anorexia.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2011-09-30,"Vitamin D deficiency in noncancer patients is associated with symptoms of fatigue, muscle weakness, and depression. These symptoms are common among advanced cancer patients. We investigated the prevalence of low serum vitamin D levels in cancer patients with fatigue or poor appetite and their association with symptom burden and other correctable endocrine abnormalities. This was a retrospective review of 100 consecutive cancer patients with appetite or fatigue scores of ≥4 of 10 referred to a supportive care clinic. We investigated serum levels of 25(OH) vitamin D, cortisol, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and bioavailable testosterone. Symptoms were measured by the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale. Serum 25(OH) vitamin D <20 ng/mL was considered deficient; ≥20 ng/mL and <30 ng/mL were considered insufficient. Patients were predominantly male (68%) and white (66%), with a median age of 60 years (range, 27-91 years). Gastrointestinal (30%) and lung (22%) cancers were predominant. Forty-seven patients (47%) were vitamin D deficient and 70 (70%) were insufficient. Thirteen of 70 patients (19%) with vitamin D insufficiency were on supplementation. Vitamin D deficiency was more common among nonwhites (82% versus 36%) and females. No significant association was found between vitamin D and symptoms. Hypogonadic males had a significantly lower mean 25(OH) vitamin D level than eugonadic males. Low vitamin D levels were highly prevalent among advanced cancer patients with cachexia or fatigue.

Germline SDHx variants modify breast and thyroid cancer risks in Cowden and Cowden-like syndrome via FAD/NAD-dependant destabilization of p53.,Human molecular genetics,Hum. Mol. Genet.,2011-10-06,"Cowden syndrome (CS), a Mendelian autosomal-dominant disorder, predisposes to breast, thyroid and other cancers. Germline mutations in phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) have been recently reported in 23% of a large series of classic CS. Here, we validated our small (n = 10) pilot study in a large patient series that germline variations in succinate dehydrogenase genes (SDHx) occur in 8% (49/608) of PTEN mutation-negative CS and CS-like (CSL) individuals (SDH(var+)). None of these SDHx variants was found in 700 population controls (P < 0.0001). We then found that SDHx variants also occur in 6% (26/444) of PTEN mutation-positive (PTEN(mut+)) CS/CSL individuals (PTEN(mut+)/SDH(var+)). Of 22 PTEN(mut+)/SDH(var+) females, 17 had breast cancers compared with 34/105 PTEN(mut+) (P < 0.001) or 27/47 SDH(var+) patients (P = 0.06). Notably, individuals with SDH(var+) alone had the highest thyroid cancer prevalence (24/47) compared with PTEN(mut+) patients (27/105, P = 0.002) or PTEN(mut+)/SDH(var+) carriers (6/22, P = 0.038). Patient-derived SDH(var+) lymphoblastoid cells had elevated cellular reactive oxygen species, highest in PTEN(mut+)/SDH(var+) cells, correlating with apoptosis resistance. SDH(var+) cells showed stabilized and hyperactivated hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)1α signaling. Most interestingly, we also observed the loss of steady-state p53 in the majority of SDH(var+) cells. This loss of p53 was regulated by MDM2-independent NADH quinone oxidoreductase 1-mediated protein degradation, likely due to the imbalance of flavin adenine dinucleotide/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in SDH(var+) cells. Our data suggest the potential regulation of HIF1α, p53 and PTEN signaling by mitochondrial metabolism in CS/CSL tumorigenesis. Together, our findings suggest the importance of considering SDHx as candidate predisposing and modifier genes for CS/CSL-related malignancy risks, and a mechanism which suggests ways of therapeutic reversal or prevention.",Journal Article,3029.0,58.0,Cowden syndrome CS a Mendelian autosomal-dominant disorder predisposes to and other cancers Germline mutations in phosphatase and tensin homolog PTEN have been recently reported in 23 of a large series of classic CS Here we validated our small n 10 pilot study in a large patient series that germline variations in succinate dehydrogenase genes SDHx occur in 8 49/608 of PTEN mutation-negative CS and CS-like CSL individuals SDH var+ None of these SDHx variants was found in 700 population controls P 0.0001 We then found that SDHx variants also occur in 6 26/444 of PTEN mutation-positive PTEN mut+ CS/CSL individuals PTEN mut+ /SDH var+ Of 22 PTEN mut+ /SDH var+ females 17 had cancers compared with 34/105 PTEN mut+ P 0.001 or 27/47 SDH var+ patients P 0.06 Notably individuals with SDH var+ alone had the highest cancer prevalence 24/47 compared with PTEN mut+ patients 27/105 P 0.002 or PTEN mut+ /SDH var+ carriers 6/22 P 0.038 Patient-derived SDH var+ lymphoblastoid cells had elevated cellular reactive oxygen species highest in PTEN mut+ /SDH var+ cells correlating with apoptosis resistance SDH var+ cells showed stabilized and hyperactivated hypoxia inducible factor HIF 1α signaling Most interestingly we also observed the loss of steady-state p53 in the majority of SDH var+ cells This loss of p53 was regulated by MDM2-independent NADH quinone oxidoreductase 1-mediated protein degradation likely due to the imbalance of flavin adenine dinucleotide/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in SDH var+ cells Our data suggest the potential regulation of HIF1α p53 and PTEN signaling by mitochondrial metabolism in CS/CSL tumorigenesis Together our findings suggest the importance of considering SDHx as candidate predisposing and modifier genes for CS/CSL-related malignancy risks and a mechanism which suggests ways of therapeutic reversal or prevention,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[5561, 681, 2188, 8, 12728, 6084, 2156, 2645, 10563, 6, 2, 127, 163, 1009, 138, 4, 2577, 2, 6111, 3412, 820, 47, 85, 761, 210, 4, 382, 1, 8, 375, 988, 1, 3168, 2188, 467, 21, 938, 114, 302, 78, 79, 2281, 45, 4, 8, 375, 69, 988, 17, 1009, 2293, 4, 8738, 2374, 214, 8073, 1271, 4, 66, 739, 11768, 1, 820, 258, 199, 2188, 2, 2188, 733, 13037, 869, 5672, 13396, 1292, 1, 46, 8073, 839, 10, 204, 4, 5692, 266, 535, 19, 13, 488, 21, 818, 204, 17, 8073, 839, 120, 1271, 4, 49, 432, 10325, 1, 820, 258, 109, 820, 3857, 2188, 13037, 869, 820, 3857, 5672, 13396, 1, 350, 820, 3857, 5672, 13396, 2451, 269, 42, 163, 72, 5, 562, 3263, 820, 3857, 19, 13, 144, 15, 428, 662, 5672, 13396, 7, 19, 13, 1460, 2552, 869, 5, 5672, 13396, 279, 42, 3, 1076, 12, 1078, 259, 662, 72, 5, 820, 3857, 7, 428, 3263, 19, 13, 1111, 15, 820, 3857, 5672, 13396, 1316, 49, 350, 19, 13, 5215, 69, 526, 5672, 13396, 10994, 37, 42, 804, 763, 2163, 2848, 2915, 1076, 4, 820, 3857, 5672, 13396, 37, 5637, 5, 351, 251, 5672, 13396, 37, 224, 7368, 2, 16922, 1823, 2877, 161, 2940, 3305, 314, 96, 2873, 21, 120, 164, 3, 407, 1, 4152, 1309, 624, 4, 3, 686, 1, 5672, 13396, 37, 26, 407, 1, 624, 10, 1065, 20, 3277, 306, 27103, 19517, 18836, 14, 517, 178, 2373, 322, 520, 6, 3, 6088, 1, 46813, 16307, 11816, 17382, 16307, 11816, 4, 5672, 13396, 37, 114, 74, 309, 3, 174, 863, 1, 10927, 624, 2, 820, 314, 20, 2019, 1600, 4, 2188, 13037, 1565, 1162, 114, 272, 309, 3, 1187, 1, 3075, 8073, 22, 1609, 6885, 2, 8833, 214, 9, 2188, 13037, 139, 710, 1098, 2, 8, 670, 92, 844, 4245, 1, 189, 5933, 15, 1070]",1860.0,21979946,592
Concurrent doxorubicin and radiotherapy for anaplastic thyroid cancer: a critical re-evaluation including uniform pathologic review.,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,Radiother Oncol,2011-10-06,"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a rare, aggressive malignancy. The potential for pathologic misclassification complicates interpretation of published data. One standard treatment option for locoregionally advanced disease is weekly low-dose doxorubicin with concurrent radiation therapy, and was previously developed at our institution. We evaluated our more recent experience with this approach, which included pathologic confirmation of all cases. A retrospective review was performed on patients identified through the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) Cancer Database. pathologically confirmed ATC; locoregional disease encompassable within a radiation portal; treatment with curative intent at MSKCC with planned weekly doxorubicin (10 mg/m(2)) and concurrent radiation. Principle outcomes assessed were locoregional progression-free survival (LR-PFS) and overall survival (OS). Thirty-seven patients were included. Median radiotherapy dose was 57.6 Gy, and was ≥ 50Gy in 29 (78%), administered through hyperfractionated or once-daily schedules. One-year outcomes were LR-PFS, 45%; OS, 28%.

Total oxidant/antioxidant status in sera of patients with thyroid cancers.,Endocrine-related cancer,Endocr. Relat. Cancer,2011-12-01,"Oxidative stress is considered to be involved in the pathophysiology of all cancers. In order to evaluate the total oxidant/antioxidant status in patients with thyroid cancer and to investigate the relationship between oxidative stress parameters and serum thyroid profiles among thyroid cancer patients and various controls, we determined oxidative status including total antioxidant status (TAS) and total oxidant status (TOS) and calculation of oxidative stress index (OSI) in sera in 82 thyroid cancer patients, 56 benign thyroid disease patients, and 50 healthy controls. It was found that serum TAS levels were significantly lower in patients with thyroid cancer than in controls (P<0.001), while serum TOS levels and OSI values were significantly higher (both P<0.001) in the cancer patients. No significant correlations were observed between various oxidative stress markers and thyroid profiles in either the thyroid cancer patients or the controls. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that OSI was the best indicator for distinguishing cancer patients from benign thyroid diseased or healthy controls, followed by TOS and TAS. Risk estimate statistics also indicated that TOS and/or OSI were good risk factors to discriminate patients with thyroid cancer from two controls. These findings suggested that oxidants are increased and antioxidants are decreased in patients with thyroid cancer.

Molecular classification of nonsmall cell lung cancer using a 4-protein quantitative assay.,Cancer,Cancer,2011-08-25,"The importance of definitive histological subclassification has increased as drug trials have shown benefit associated with histology in nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The acuity of this problem is further exacerbated by the use of minimally invasive cytology samples. Here we describe the development and validation of a 4-protein classifier that differentiates primary lung adenocarcinomas (AC) from squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). Quantitative immunofluorescence (AQUA) was employed to measure proteins differentially expressed between AC and SCC followed by logistic regression analysis. An objective 4-protein classifier was generated to define likelihood of AC in a training set of 343 patients followed by validation in 2 independent cohorts (n = 197 and n = 235). The assay was then tested on 11 cytology specimens. Statistical modeling selected thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1), CK5, CK13, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to generate a weighted classifier and to identify the optimal cutpoint for differentiating AC from SCC. Using the pathologist's final diagnosis as the criterion standard, the molecular test showed a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 93%. Blinded analysis of the validation sets yielded sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 97%, respectively. Our assay classified the cytology specimens with a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 87.5%.

Most studies show no increased risk with family history of cancer. Non-malignant diseases such as allergic diseases, autoimmune diseases, birth defects and thyroid diseases have been reported to be associated with ALL. We conducted a case-control study of family history of cancer and selected non-malignant conditions (allergic diseases, autoimmune diseases, birth defects, and thyroid diseases). ALL cases were obtained from Children's Cancer Group institutions from January 1989 to June 1993. Controls were recruited via random digit dialing. Family history for first degree relatives and grandparents of ALL cases and controls was collected by structured telephone questionnaires. Conditional logistical regression was used to calculate odds ratios adjusting for potential confounders. We found a borderline association of ALL and having a family member with a history of cancer in cases (n=1842) compared to controls (n=1986) (OR=0.98, 95%CI=0.93, 1.00) and an inverse association for esophageal cancer based on small numbers.

Chemotherapy and thyroid cancer risk: a report from the childhood cancer survivor study.,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev.,2011-10-25,"Although ionizing radiation is an established environmental risk factor for thyroid cancer, the effect of chemotherapy drugs on thyroid cancer risk remains unclear. We evaluated the chemotherapy-related risk of thyroid cancer in childhood cancer survivors and the possible joint effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The study included 12,547 five-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed during 1970 through 1986. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy information was obtained from medical records, and radiation dose was estimated to the thyroid gland. Cumulative incidence and relative risks were calculated with life-table methods and Poisson regression. Chemotherapy-related risks were evaluated separately by categories of radiation dose. Histologically confirmed thyroid cancer occurred in 119 patients. Thirty years after the first childhood cancer treatment, the cumulative incidence of thyroid cancer was 1.3% (95% CI, 1.0-1.6) for females and 0.6% (0.4-0.8) for males. Among patients with thyroid radiation doses of 20 Gy or less, treatment with alkylating agents was associated with a significant 2.4-fold increased risk of thyroid cancer (95% CI, 1.3-4.5; P = 0.002). Chemotherapy risks decreased as radiation dose increased, with a significant decrease for patients treated with alkylating agents (P(trend) = 0.03).

BRAF mutations in advanced cancers: clinical characteristics and outcomes.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2011-10-19,"Oncogenic BRAF mutations have been found in diverse malignancies and activate RAF/MEK/ERK signaling, a critical pathway of tumorigenesis. We examined the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with mutant (mut) BRAF advanced cancer referred to phase 1 clinic. We reviewed the records of 80 consecutive patients with mutBRAF advanced malignancies and 149 with wild-type (wt) BRAF (matched by tumor type) referred to the Clinical Center for Targeted Therapy and analyzed their outcome. Of 80 patients with mutBRAF advanced cancer, 56 had melanoma, 10 colorectal, 11 papillary thyroid, 2 ovarian and 1 esophageal cancer. Mutations in codon 600 were found in 77 patients (62, V600E; 13, V600K; 1, V600R; 1, unreported). Multivariate analysis showed less soft tissue (Odds ratio (OR) = 0.39, 95%CI: 0.20-0.77, P = 0.007), lung (OR = 0.38, 95%CI: 0.19-0.73, p = 0.004) and retroperitoneal metastases (OR = 0.34, 95%CI: 0.13-0.86, p = 0.024) and more brain metastases (OR = 2.05, 95%CI: 1.02-4.11, P = 0.043) in patients with mutBRAF versus wtBRAF. Comparing to the corresponding wtBRAF, mutBRAF melanoma patients had insignificant trend to longer median survival from diagnosis (131 vs. 78 months, p = 0.14), while mutBRAF colorectal cancer patients had an insignificant trend to shorter median survival from diagnosis (48 vs. 53 months, p = 0.22). In melanoma, V600K mutations in comparison to other BRAF mutations were associated with more frequent brain (75% vs. 36.3%, p = 0.02) and lung metastases (91.6% vs. 47.7%, p = 0.007), and shorter time from diagnosis to metastasis and to death (19 vs. 53 months, p = 0.046 and 78 vs. 322 months, p = 0.024 respectively).

Incidence of malignancy in thyroid nodules determined to be follicular lesions of undetermined significance on fine-needle aspiration.,World journal of surgery,World J Surg,2012-01-01,"Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for thyroid nodules is the most important method for determining a diagnosis. The system for reporting results is based on a cytopathologic classification that stratifies the risk of malignancy.

The objective of the study was to analyze the incidence and histopathologic types of malignancy in these cases. The final histopathologic breakdown is as follows: 65 cases (32.9%) of follicular adenoma, 81 cases (41.1%) of microfollicular adenomatoid nodule, 19 cases (9.6%) of microfollicular adenomatoid nodule on the background of thyroiditis, 17 cases (8.6%) of follicular carcinoma, 9 cases (4.6%) of follicular variant papillary carcinoma, and 6 cases (3.1%) of classic papillary carcinoma, for a 16.2% incidence of malignancy. Beyond these diagnoses in the FNA-biopsied nodules, we observed 29 cases (14.7%) of incidental ipsilateral papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTM) and 13 cases (6.6%) of incidental contralateral thyroid lobe PTM. This study observed a 16.2% incidence of thyroid cancer in the nodule designated FLUS compared to the 5 to 15% rate reported by the Bethesda FNA classification.

Small-molecule MAPK inhibitors restore radioiodine incorporation in mouse thyroid cancers with conditional BRAF activation.,The Journal of clinical investigation,J. Clin. Invest.,2011-11-21,"Advanced human thyroid cancers, particularly those that are refractory to treatment with radioiodine (RAI), have a high prevalence of BRAF (v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1) mutations. However, the degree to which these cancers are dependent on BRAF expression is still unclear. To address this question, we generated mice expressing one of the most commonly detected BRAF mutations in human papillary thyroid carcinomas (BRAF(V600E)) in thyroid follicular cells in a doxycycline-inducible (dox-inducible) manner. Upon dox induction of BRAF(V600E), the mice developed highly penetrant and poorly differentiated thyroid tumors. Discontinuation of dox extinguished BRAF(V600E) expression and reestablished thyroid follicular architecture and normal thyroid histology. Switching on BRAF(V600E) rapidly induced hypothyroidism and virtually abolished thyroid-specific gene expression and RAI incorporation, all of which were restored to near basal levels upon discontinuation of dox. Treatment of mice with these cancers with small molecule inhibitors of either MEK or mutant BRAF reduced their proliferative index and partially restored thyroid-specific gene expression.

Long-term outcome of comprehensive central compartment dissection in patients with recurrent/persistent papillary thyroid carcinoma.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2011-12-01,"Persistent or recurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) occurs in some patients after initial thyroid surgery and often, radioactive iodine treatment. Here, we identify the efficacy, safety, and long-term outcome of our current surgical management paradigm for persistent/recurrent PTC in the central compartment in an interdisciplinary thyroid cancer clinical and research program at a tertiary thyroid cancer referral center. We retrospectively analyzed our standardized approach of comprehensive bilateral level VI/VII lymph node dissection (SND [VI, VII]) for cytologically confirmed PTC in the central compartment. From 1994 to 2004, 210 patients, median age 42 (range 12-82) underwent SND (VI, VII). Most patients (106, 51%) had already undergone ≥2 surgical procedures for persistent or recurrent disease, and 31 (15%) had distant metastases at presentation. Postoperatively, 104 (71%) of the 146 patients who were thyroglobulin (Tg) positive had no evidence of disease. Anti-Tg antibodies were present in 38 patients (18%), 17 of whom (53%) did not have anti-Tg antibodies postoperatively. Fourteen patients (7%) were hypoparathyroid at presentation, and 2 more (1%) became permanently hypoparathyroid after surgery. Four patients (2%) experienced recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis (RLNP) of a previously functioning nerve. Unanticipated RLNP was observed in only one nerve at risk. External beam radiation was given to 33 patients (17%). An additional 17 patients (8%) developed distant metastases during follow-up. At the last follow-up, 130 (66%) of the 196 patients had no detectable Tg; of these, 99 (76%) had no further evidence of disease. A median of 7.25 years after surgery, 167 (90%) of the 185 patients were without evidence of central disease, and 18 (10%) had developed central compartment recurrences within a median interval of 24.3 months. Of those with recurrence, 16 out of 18 patients (89%) underwent a subsequent surgical procedure, thus resulting in an overall 98% central compartment control rate. Kaplan-Meier disease-specific survival at 10 years was 98.9% for patients <45 years old and 77.9% for those ≥45 years old (log-rank p<0.00001).

Necroptosis is a novel mechanism of radiation-induced cell death in anaplastic thyroid and adrenocortical cancers.,Surgery,Surgery,2011-12-01,"Necroptosis is a recently described mechanism of programmed cellular death. We hypothesize that necroptosis plays an important role in radiation-induced cell death in endocrine cancers.

H295R cells deficient in receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1), an essential kinase for necroptosis, were used as controls. Survival curves were generated at increasing doses of radiation. Nec-1 and zVAD increased cellular survival with increasing doses of radiotherapy in 8505c, TPC-1, and SW13. Both inhibitors used together had an additive effect. At 6 Gy, 8505c, TPC-1, and SW13 cell survival was significantly increased compared to controls by 40%, 33%, and 31% with Nec-1 treatment, by 53%, 47%, and 44% with zVAD treatment, and by 80%, 70%, and 65% with both compounds, respectively (P < .05). H295R showed no change in survival with Nec-1 treatment. The radiobiologic parameter quasithreshold dose was significantly increased in 8505c, TPC-1, and SW13 cells when both Nec-1 and zVAD were used in combination to inhibit necroptosis and apoptosis together, revealing resistance to standard doses of fractionated therapeutic radiation.

BRAF mutation analysis of fine-needle aspiration biopsies of papillary thyroid carcinoma: impact on diagnosis and prognosis.,Acta cytologica,Acta Cytol.,2011-12-09,"The BRAF V600E mutation has been associated with aggressive disease in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Molecular testing has been proposed as a useful adjunct to cytology in the diagnosis of malignancy and for tailoring clinical management. The aims of our study were to evaluate the BRAF mutational status using archived fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) material from patients with long-term follow-up and to correlate it with the original cytology diagnosis, clinicopathological stage at surgery, and prognosis. FNAB material from 52 cases of PTC, with a mean follow-up of 8.4 years, was used in this study. DNA was extracted from archival cytology slides. Mutation analysis was performed by standard sequencing and locked nucleic acid-PCR/sequencing. The BRAF V600E mutation was present in 46% of cases, but it was absent in all FNABs diagnosed originally as atypical and in 14 of 17 suspicious cases.

Vertebral compression fracture risk after stereotactic body radiotherapy for spinal metastases.,Journal of neurosurgery. Spine,J Neurosurg Spine,2012-01-06,"The aim of this study was to identify potential risk factors for and determine the rate of vertebral compression fracture (VCF) after intensity-modulated, near-simultaneous, CT image-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for spinal metastases. The study group consisted of 123 vertebral bodies (VBs) in 93 patients enrolled in prospective protocols for metastatic disease. Data from these patients were retrospectively analyzed. Stereotactic body radiotherapy consisted of 1, 3, or 5 fractions for overall median doses of 18, 27, and 30 Gy, respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging studies, obtained at baseline and at each follow-up, were evaluated for VCFs, tumor involvement, and radiographic progression. Self-reported average pain levels were scored based on the 11-point (0-10) Brief Pain Inventory both at baseline and at follow-up. Obesity was defined as a body mass index ≥ 30. The median imaging follow-up was 14.9 months (range 1-71 months). Twenty-five new or progressing fractures (20%) were identified, and the median time to progression was 3 months after SBRT. The most common histologies included renal cancer (36 VBs, 10 fractures, 10 tumor progressions), breast cancer (20 VBs, 0 fractures, 5 tumor progressions), thyroid cancer (14 VBs, 1 fracture, 2 tumor progressions), non-small cell lung cancer (13 VBs, 3 fractures, 3 tumor progressions), and sarcoma (9 VBs, 2 fractures, 2 tumor progressions). Fifteen VBs were treated with kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty after SBRT, with 5 procedures done for preexisting VCFs. Tumor progression was noted in 32 locations (26%) with 5 months' median time to progression. At the time of noted fracture progression there was a trend toward higher average pain scores but no significant change in the median value. Univariate logistic regression showed that an age > 55 years (HR 6.05, 95% CI 2.1-17.47), a preexisting fracture (HR 5.05, 95% CI 1.94-13.16), baseline pain and narcotic use before SBRT (pain: HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.06-1.62; narcotic: HR 2.98, 95% CI 1.17-7.56) and after SBRT (pain: HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.06-1.70; narcotic: HR 3.63, 95% CI 1.41-9.29) were statistically significant predictors of fracture progression. On multivariate analysis an age > 55 years (HR 10.66, 95% CI 2.81-40.36), a preexisting fracture (HR 9.17, 95% CI 2.31-36.43), and baseline pain (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.05-1.9) were found to be significant risks, whereas obesity (HR 0.02, 95% CI 0-0.2) was protective. Stereotactic body radiotherapy is associated with a significant risk (20%) of VCF. Risk factors for VCF include an age > 55 years, a preexisting fracture, and baseline pain. These risk factors may aid in the selection of which spinal SBRT patients should be considered for prophylactic vertebral stabilization or augmentation procedures.

Cancer Res.,2012-01-12,"A multicenter, open-label, phase II trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of selumetinib in iodine-refractory papillary thyroid cancer (IRPTC). Patients with advanced IRPTC with or without follicular elements and documented disease progression within the preceding 12 months were eligible to receive selumetinib at a dose of 100 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was objective response rate using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Secondary endpoints were safety, overall survival, and progression-free survival (PFS). Tumor genotype including mutations in BRAF, NRAS, and HRAS was assessed. Best responses in 32 evaluable patients out of 39 enrolled were 1 partial response (3%), 21 stable disease (54%), and 11 progressive disease (28%). Disease stability maintenance occurred for 16 weeks in 49%, 24 weeks in 36%. Median PFS was 32 weeks. BRAF V600E mutants (12 of 26 evaluated, 46%) had a longer median PFS compared with patients with BRAF wild-type (WT) tumors (33 versus 11 weeks, respectively, HR = 0.6, not significant, P = 0.3). The most common adverse events and grades 3 to 4 toxicities included rash, fatigue, diarrhea, and peripheral edema. Two pulmonary deaths occurred in the study and were judged unlikely to be related to the study drug. Selumetinib was well tolerated but the study was negative with regard to the primary outcome. Secondary analyses suggest that future studies of selumetinib and other mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK; MEK) inhibitors in IRPTC should consider BRAF V600E mutation status in the trial design based on differential trends in outcome.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",2931.0,98.0,A multicenter open-label phase II trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy safety and tolerability of selumetinib in iodine-refractory papillary cancer IRPTC Patients with advanced IRPTC with or without follicular elements and documented disease progression within the preceding 12 months were eligible to receive selumetinib at a dose of 100 mg twice daily The primary endpoint was objective response rate using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Secondary endpoints were safety overall survival and progression-free survival PFS Tumor genotype including mutations in BRAF NRAS and HRAS was assessed Best responses in 32 evaluable patients out of 39 enrolled were 1 partial response 3 21 stable disease 54 and 11 progressive disease 28 Disease stability maintenance occurred for 16 weeks in 49 24 weeks in 36 Median PFS was 32 weeks BRAF V600E mutants 12 of 26 evaluated 46 had a longer median PFS compared with patients with BRAF wild-type WT tumors 33 versus 11 weeks respectively HR 0.6 not significant P 0.3 The most common adverse events and grades 3 to 4 toxicities included rash fatigue diarrhea and peripheral edema Two pulmonary deaths occurred in the study and were judged unlikely to be related to the study drug Selumetinib was well tolerated but the study was negative with regard to the primary outcome Secondary analyses suggest that future studies of selumetinib and other mitogen-activated protein MAP /extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK MEK inhibitors in IRPTC should consider BRAF V600E mutation status in the trial design based on differential trends in outcome,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[8, 1570, 1020, 1756, 124, 215, 160, 10, 426, 6, 376, 3, 209, 367, 2, 1543, 1, 4626, 4, 4287, 430, 1796, 12, 39866, 7, 5, 131, 39866, 5, 15, 187, 1974, 2531, 2, 1405, 34, 91, 262, 3, 5892, 133, 53, 11, 625, 6, 560, 4626, 28, 8, 61, 1, 394, 81, 936, 391, 3, 86, 1138, 10, 461, 51, 116, 75, 51, 451, 371, 4, 537, 57, 568, 1387, 11, 367, 63, 25, 2, 91, 115, 25, 300, 30, 1183, 141, 138, 4, 566, 2845, 2, 7174, 10, 275, 824, 253, 4, 531, 859, 7, 1205, 1, 587, 346, 11, 14, 450, 51, 27, 239, 585, 34, 667, 2, 175, 1014, 34, 339, 34, 2769, 1146, 489, 9, 245, 244, 4, 739, 259, 244, 4, 511, 52, 300, 10, 531, 244, 566, 2047, 3423, 133, 1, 432, 194, 641, 42, 8, 589, 52, 300, 72, 5, 7, 5, 566, 955, 267, 1820, 57, 466, 185, 175, 244, 106, 168, 13, 49, 44, 93, 19, 13, 27, 3, 96, 186, 290, 281, 2, 2276, 27, 6, 39, 385, 159, 1641, 613, 1172, 2, 672, 3306, 100, 1087, 1043, 489, 4, 3, 45, 2, 11, 7249, 3568, 6, 40, 139, 6, 3, 45, 234, 4626, 10, 149, 421, 84, 3, 45, 10, 199, 5, 2539, 6, 3, 86, 228, 568, 318, 309, 17, 508, 94, 1, 4626, 2, 127, 2625, 735, 178, 3771, 1976, 1235, 1065, 216, 1819, 1693, 222, 4, 39866, 257, 2419, 566, 2047, 258, 156, 4, 3, 160, 771, 90, 23, 1777, 1963, 4, 228]",1603.0,22241789,497
Lifetime cancer risks in individuals with germline PTEN mutations.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2012-01-01,"Age-adjusted cancer incidence and age-related penetrance studies have helped guide cancer risk assessment and management. PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) is a term encompassing subsets of several clinical syndromes with germline mutations in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene. We conducted the first prospective study to clarify corresponding cancer risks to shed biologic insights on human germline PTEN mutations, and to better inform current surveillance recommendations on the basis of expert opinion. A series of 3,399 individuals meeting relaxed International Cowden Consortium PHTS criteria were prospectively recruited; 368 individuals were found to have deleterious germline PTEN mutations. Age-adjusted standardized incidence ratio (SIR) calculations and genotype-phenotype analyses were carried out. Elevated SIRs were found for carcinomas of the breast [25.4, 95% confidence interval (CI), 19.8-32.0], thyroid (51.1, 38.1-67.1), endometrium (42.9, 28.1-62.8), colorectum (10.3, 5.6-17.4), kidney (30.6, 17.8-49.4), and melanoma (8.5, 4.1-15.6). Estimated lifetime risks were, respectively, 85.2% (95% CI, 71.4%-99.1%), 35.2% (19.7%-50.7%), 28.2% (17.1%-39.3%), 9.0% (3.8%-14.1%), 33.6% (10.4%-56.9%), and 6% (1.6%-9.4%). Promoter mutations were associated with breast cancer, whereas colorectal cancer was associated with nonsense mutations.

Evaluation of postoperative radioactive iodine scans in patients who underwent prophylactic central lymph node dissection.,World journal of surgery,World J Surg,2012-06-01,"Prophylactic central lymph node dissection (CLND) accompanying total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) remains controversial. Our hypothesis is that CLND may help select patients who benefit from postoperative radioactive iodine (RAI). A total of 119 patients who were clinically node-negative underwent total thyroidectomy/bilateral CLND for papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) > 1 cm during 2002-2010. Pathology results, RAI results, and outcomes were compared between node-positive (NP) and node-negative (NN) patients. NP and NN patients were similar in age, gender, tumor size, and MACIS score. Median number of nodes excised was six. The rate of permanent hypocalcemia was 1.7% without permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve injuries. Thirteen of 52 (25%) NN patients and 24 of 67 (36%) NP patients had suspicious nodes by intraoperative inspection. The node assessment negative predictive value was 75%; positive predictive value was 36%. Fifty-six percent (67/118) were NP; 100 patients were treated with RAI. Fourteen of 62 NP patients had abnormal postoperative RAI scans aside from the thyroid remnant versus 4 of 38 NN patients (23 vs. 11%, p = 0.18). Median 1-year stimulated thyroglobulin (Tg) level was 0.0 for both (range 0.0-1.2, NN; 0.0-22.7, NP; p = 0.1). NP patients received higher doses of RAI (150 vs. 30 mCi, p < 0.001). Rate of recurrent or persistent disease was 3.4%. Few node-negative patients have abnormal RAI scans outside of the thyroid bed.

From a database of 321 patients with MCC, 38 (12%) were identified as having nodal MCCUP. Median age was 67 years, and 79% were men. Nodal basins involved at presentation were cervical (58%), axillary/epitrochlear (21%), or inguinal/iliac (21%).

"In papillary thyroid cancer, preoperative central neck ultrasound detects only macroscopic surgical disease, but negative findings predict excellent long-term regional control and survival.",Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2012-01-26,"Ultrasound (US) of the central neck compartment (CNC) is considered of limited sensitivity for nodal spread in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC); elective neck dissection is commonly advocated even in the absence of sonographic abnormalities. We hypothesized that US is an accurate predictor for long-term disease-free survival, regardless of the use of elective central neck dissection in patients with PTC. A retrospective chart review of 331 consecutive PTC patients treated with total thyroidectomy at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1996 and 2003 was performed. Information retrieved included preoperative sonographic status of the CNC, surgical treatment of the neck, demographics, cancer staging, histopathological variables and use of adjuvant treatment. The endpoints for the study were nodal recurrence and survival. There were 112 males and 219 females with a median age of 44 years (range 11-87). The median follow-up time for the series was 71.5 months (range 12.7-148.7). There were 151 (45.6%) patients with a T1, 58 (17.5%) with a T2, 70 (21.1%) with a T3, and 52 (15.7%) with a T4. Preoperative sonographic abnormalities were present in the CNC in 79 (23.9%) patients. During the surveillance period, 11 (3.2%) patients recurred in the central neck, with an average time for recurrence of 22.8 months. Advanced T stage (T3/T4) and abnormal US were independent prognostic factors for recurrence in the central neck (p=0.013 and p=0.005 respectively). There were 119 (35%) patients with a sonographically negative central compartment who underwent elective central neck dissection; 85 of them (71.4%) were found to be histopathologically N(+) while 34 (28.6%) were pN0. There were no differences in overall survival (p=0.32), disease specific survival (DSS; p=0.49), and recurrence-free survival (p=0.32) between these two groups. Preoperative US of the CNC was an age-independent predictor for overall survival (p<0.001), DSS (p=0.0097), and disease-free survival (p=0.0005) on bivariate Cox regression.

Liver resection for liver metastases from nondigestive endocrine cancer: extrahepatic disease burden defines outcome.,Surgery,Surgery,2012-02-04,"For patients with hepatic nondigestive endocrine metastases (HNEM), the role of liver resection is not well-defined. We reviewed outcomes for patients who underwent liver resection for HNEM at 2 centers to identify predictors of survival. From 1991 to 2010, 51 patients underwent liver resection for HNEM. Primary tumor types were adrenal gland (n = 26), thyroid (n = 11), testicular germ cell (n = 9), and ovarian granulosa cell (n = 5). 28 patients (55%) had synchronous or early (diagnosed within 12 months after primary tumor resection) liver metastases. At liver resection, 26 patients (51%) had extrahepatic metastases, and 7 (14%) had ≥2 sites of extrahepatic metastases. 32 patients (63%) had major liver resection and 19 (37%) had a simultaneous extrahepatic procedure. 90-day postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were 27% and 2%, respectively. After median follow-up of 20 months (range, 1-144), the 5-year overall and recurrence-free survival rates were 58% and 37%, respectively. Survival was not affected by primary tumor type. In multivariate analysis, ≥2 sites of extrahepatic metastases (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18-19.50; P = .028) and interval of ≤12 months between primary tumor resection and diagnosis of liver metastases (HR = 5.33; 95% CI = 1.11-25.71; P = .037) were associated with worse overall survival after liver resection.

The controversy relates to its unproven role in reducing recurrence rates while possibly increasing morbidity (permanent hypoparathyroidism and unintentional recurrent laryngeal nerve injury). We examined the design and feasibility of a multi-institutional prospective randomized controlled trial of prophylactic central lymph node dissection in cN0 PTC. Assuming a 7-year study with 4 years of enrollment, 5 years of average follow-up, a recurrence rate of 10% after 7 years, a 25% relative reduction in the rate of the primary endpoint (newly identified structural disease; i.e., persistent, recurrent, or distant metastatic disease) with central lymph node dissection and an annual dropout rate of 3%, a total of 5840 patients would have to be included in the study to achieve at least 80% statistical power. Similarly, given the low rates of morbidity, several thousands of patients would need to be included to identify a significant difference in rates of permanent hypoparathyroidism and unintentional recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. Given the low rates of both newly identified structural disease and morbidity after surgery for cN0 PTC, prohibitively large sample sizes would be required for sufficient statistical power to demonstrate significant differences in outcomes.

American Thyroid Association statement on the essential elements of interdisciplinary communication of perioperative information for patients undergoing thyroid cancer surgery.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2012-02-21,"Thyroid cancer specialists require specific perioperative information to develop a management plan for patients with thyroid cancer, but there is not yet a model for effective interdisciplinary data communication. The American Thyroid Association Surgical Affairs Committee was asked to define a suggested essential perioperative dataset representing the critical information that should be readily available to participating members of the treatment team. To identify and agree upon a multidisciplinary set of critical perioperative findings requiring communication, we examined diverse best-practice documents relating to thyroidectomy and extracted common features felt to enhance precise, direct communication with nonsurgical caregivers. Suggested essential datasets for the preoperative, intraoperative, and immediate postoperative findings and management of patients undergoing surgery for thyroid cancer were identified and are presented. For operative reporting, the essential features of both a dictated narrative format and a synoptic computer format are modeled in detail.

Risk of rash in cancer patients treated with vandetanib: systematic review and meta-analysis.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2012-02-29,"Vandetanib is an oral inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, and rearranged during transfection tyrosine kinases. It is approved for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer. Its use may be hindered due to adverse events, including rash. The reported incidence and risk of rash to vandetanib varies widely and has not been more closely investigated. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to determine the incidence and risk of developing a rash. Databases from PubMed from 1996 through July 2011 and abstracts presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meetings from 2004 through July 2011 were searched for relevant studies. Eligible studies were prospective trials that described side effects of all-grade or high-grade rash for patients who received vandetanib 300 mg as a single agent. The incidence of all-grade and high-grade rash and relative risk were calculated using random-effects or fixed-effects models. Of 63 studies initially identified, nine met the selection criteria and were included for the study. A total of 2961 patients were included for analysis. The summary incidences of all-grade and high-grade rash were 46.1% [95% confidence interval (CI), 40.6-51.8%] and 3.5% (95% CI, 2.5-4.7%), respectively. From randomized controlled trials, patients who received vandetanib 300 mg had a significantly increased risk of developing all-grade rash in comparison with controls, with a relative risk of 2.43 (95% CI, 1.37-4.29; P = 0.002).

The prevalence of thyroid cancer and benign thyroid disease in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis may be higher than previously recognized.,Clinical colorectal cancer,Clin Colorectal Cancer,2012-03-15,"Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are at increased risk for colorectal cancer and extracolonic neoplasms. The prevalence of thyroid cancer (TC) and benign thyroid disease in this patient population is unclear, and guidelines for screening for TC in these patients are not well established. The purpose of this study was to report the prevalence of TC and benign thyroid disease in patients with FAP. The prospectively maintained Hereditary Colorectal Cancer Family Registry at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center was queried to identify patients with FAP and with TC and/or benign thyroid disease. Sixty-six patients with FAP were identified. There were 30 men and 36 women, with a median age of 38.6 years. Four (6.1%) patients had a history of TC. All were women, with a mean age at TC diagnosis of 36.5 years. Three of the 4 TCs were papillary thyroid cancer. Two patients with TC presented with palpable nodules.

Reoperative lymph node dissection for recurrent papillary thyroid cancer and effect on serum thyroglobulin.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2012-04-24,"Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) has an excellent prognosis with current treatment methods. However, the rates of locoregional recurrence after initial surgical management remain significant. This study evaluates the effect of reoperative neck dissection for locoregional recurrence of PTC after initial total thyroidectomy and radioiodine therapy on the incidence of cervical recurrence and postoperative serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels. This is a retrospective cohort study conducted in a single academic medical center of patients with recurrent or persistent PTC isolated to the neck after previous total thyroidectomy with or without lymph node dissection and adjuvant I(131) therapy who were treated with reoperative lymph node dissection. Outcomes including operative complications, pathologic findings, and effect of surgery on Tg levels and rates of recurrent disease were analyzed. From 2001 to 2010, a total of 61 patients had reoperative neck dissections for recurrent cervical PTC with a complication rate of 5 %. Seventy-two percent of patients were clinically free of detectable disease, and 28 % of patients had recurrent, persistent, or newly metastatic disease detected during the follow-up period.

Glycolytic inhibition alters anaplastic thyroid carcinoma tumor metabolism and improves response to conventional chemotherapy and radiation.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2012-05-09,"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) accounts for more than 50% of thyroid cancer mortality and is generally refractory to conventional treatment. On the basis of recent studies, we hypothesized that ATC metabolism can be targeted to improve response to chemoradiotherapy. Eight established and authenticated ATC cell lines were sequenced at 140 sites contained within 26 commonly mutated genes to identify novel potential therapeutic targets. Cellular proliferation, energy, and reducing potential stores were measured under conditions of specific nutrient deprivation. Tumor metabolism was evaluated using hyperpolarized (13)C MRI in a murine orthotopic xenograft model of ATC. Sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents and radiation (XRT) was assayed using cytotoxicity assays. We identified mutations in BRAF, NRAS, and KIT but failed to identify generalized novel targets for therapeutic intervention. ATC cell lines exhibited a mesenchymal phenotype and generalized dependence on glucose for energy, reducing potential and survival. Glycolytic inhibition using 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) sensitized ATC cells to conventional chemotherapy and external beam radiation. In vivo, 2-DG induced a transient, but significant reduction in ATC metabolic activity. Generalized dependence of ATC cells on glucose catabolism makes them susceptible to the sensitizing effects of 2-DG for radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Under in vivo conditions, 2-DG can inhibit ATC metabolism. However, the modest magnitude and transient nature of this effect suggest the need for antimetabolic agents with more favorable pharmacodynamics to achieve therapeutic effects.",Journal Article,2813.0,32.0,Anaplastic carcinoma ATC accounts for more than 50 of cancer mortality and is generally refractory to conventional treatment On the basis of recent studies we hypothesized that ATC metabolism can be targeted to improve response to chemoradiotherapy Eight established and authenticated ATC cell lines were sequenced at 140 sites contained within 26 commonly mutated genes to identify novel potential therapeutic targets Cellular proliferation energy and reducing potential stores were measured under conditions of specific nutrient deprivation Tumor metabolism was evaluated using hyperpolarized 13 C MRI in a murine orthotopic xenograft model of ATC Sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents and radiation XRT was assayed using cytotoxicity assays We identified mutations in BRAF NRAS and KIT but failed to identify generalized novel targets for therapeutic intervention ATC cell lines exhibited a mesenchymal phenotype and generalized dependence on glucose for energy reducing potential and survival Glycolytic inhibition using 2-deoxyglucose 2-DG sensitized ATC cells to conventional chemotherapy and external beam radiation In vivo 2-DG induced a transient but significant reduction in ATC metabolic activity Generalized dependence of ATC cells on glucose catabolism makes them susceptible to the sensitizing effects of 2-DG for radiation therapy and chemotherapy Under in vivo conditions 2-DG can inhibit ATC metabolism However the modest magnitude and transient nature of this effect suggest the need for antimetabolic agents with more favorable pharmacodynamics to achieve therapeutic effects,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[1841, 134, 3871, 4162, 9, 80, 76, 212, 1, 12, 282, 2, 16, 1228, 430, 6, 809, 24, 23, 3, 877, 1, 435, 94, 21, 1237, 17, 3871, 1600, 122, 40, 238, 6, 401, 51, 6, 1464, 659, 635, 2, 29111, 3871, 31, 285, 11, 4040, 28, 3304, 633, 3070, 262, 432, 841, 1185, 214, 6, 255, 229, 174, 189, 637, 763, 457, 2803, 2, 1818, 174, 21026, 11, 644, 669, 1298, 1, 112, 8749, 1868, 30, 1600, 10, 194, 75, 14022, 233, 256, 704, 4, 8, 1471, 2157, 1330, 202, 1, 3871, 485, 6, 1573, 183, 2, 121, 3429, 10, 4499, 75, 1408, 1013, 21, 108, 138, 4, 566, 2845, 2, 1164, 84, 1551, 6, 255, 4169, 229, 637, 9, 189, 788, 3871, 31, 285, 1416, 8, 1569, 1005, 2, 4169, 3721, 23, 2522, 9, 2803, 1818, 174, 2, 25, 6688, 297, 75, 18, 15092, 18, 13746, 4242, 3871, 37, 6, 809, 56, 2, 1455, 1345, 121, 4, 386, 18, 13746, 277, 8, 2473, 84, 93, 628, 4, 3871, 1436, 128, 4169, 3721, 1, 3871, 37, 23, 2522, 12813, 4677, 1370, 4012, 6, 3, 5979, 176, 1, 18, 13746, 9, 121, 36, 2, 56, 669, 4, 386, 1298, 18, 13746, 122, 1433, 3871, 1600, 137, 3, 1721, 3131, 2, 2473, 2202, 1, 26, 254, 309, 3, 594, 9, 26932, 183, 5, 80, 913, 3587, 6, 1359, 189, 176]",1595.0,22572813,146

"Dabrafenib in patients with melanoma, untreated brain metastases, and other solid tumours: a phase 1 dose-escalation trial.","Lancet (London, England)",Lancet,2012-05-01,"Dabrafenib is an inhibitor of BRAF kinase that is selective for mutant BRAF. We aimed to assess its safety and tolerability and to establish a recommended phase 2 dose in patients with incurable solid tumours, especially those with melanoma and untreated, asymptomatic brain metastases. We undertook a phase 1 trial between May 27, 2009, and March 20, 2012, at eight study centres in Australia and the USA. Eligible patients had incurable solid tumours, were 18 years or older, and had adequate organ function. BRAF mutations were mandatory for inclusion later in the study because of an absence of activity in patients with wild-type BRAF. We used an accelerated dose titration method, with the first dose cohort receiving 12 mg dabrafenib daily in a 21-day cycle. Once doses had been established, we expanded the cohorts to include up to 20 patients. On the basis of initial data, we chose a recommended phase 2 dose. Efficacy at the recommended phase 2 dose was studied in patients with BRAF-mutant tumours, including those with non-Val600Glu mutations, in three cohorts: metastatic melanoma, melanoma with untreated brain metastases, and non-melanoma solid tumours. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00880321. We enrolled 184 patients, of whom 156 had metastatic melanoma. The most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 2 or worse were cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma (20 patients, 11%), fatigue (14, 8%), and pyrexia (11, 6%). Dose reductions were necessary in 13 (7%) patients. No deaths or discontinuations resulted from adverse events, and 140 (76%) patients had no treatment-related adverse events worse than grade 2. Doses were increased to 300 mg twice daily, with no maximum tolerated dose recorded. On the basis of safety, pharmacokinetic, and response data, we selected a recommended phase 2 dose of 150 mg twice daily. At the recommended phase 2 dose in 36 patients with Val600 BRAF-mutant melanoma, responses were reported in 25 (69%, 95% CI 51·9-83·7) and confirmed responses in 18 (50%, 32·9-67·1). 21 (78%, 57·7-91·4) of 27 patients with Val600Glu BRAF-mutant melanoma responded and 15 (56%, 35·3-74·5) had a confirmed response. In Val600 BRAF-mutant melanoma, responses were durable, with 17 patients (47%) on treatment for more than 6 months. Responses were recorded in patients with non-Val600Glu BRAF mutations. In patients with melanoma and untreated brain metastases, nine of ten patients had reductions in size of brain lesions.

Oncol.,2012-05-15,"Cervical rhabdomyosarcoma is extremely rare, and there is a paucity of literature on the subject. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical and pathologic features of cervical rhabdomyosarcoma. We retrospectively reviewed all patients with cervical rhabdomyosarcoma who presented to our institution from 1980 to 2010. We reviewed pathologic, demographic, and clinical information. During the study period, 11 females presented with cervical rhabdomyosarcoma. The median age at presentation was 18.4 years, and 6 patients were <19 years old at diagnosis. Vaginal bleeding was the most common presenting symptom, and a vaginal mass was often a co-presenting symptom. Eight patients (73%) presented with stage IB disease, and 8 (73%) presented with the embryonal (botryoid) histologic subtype. Nine patients (82%) received multimodal therapy consisting of surgery with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or both. All patients were without evidence of disease after completion of primary therapy, but 3 patients experienced local recurrence. At a median follow-up of 23 months, 6 patients (55%) were without evidence of disease, 1 (9%) was alive with disease, 1 (9%) had died of disease, and 3 (27%) had died of other causes. Three patients (27%) had other primary malignancies in addition to rhabdomyosarcoma-1 had a Sertoli-Leydig tumor, 1 had a Sertoli-Leydig tumor and a pinealoblastoma, and 1 had thyroid cancer and a parotid adenocarcinoma.

A phase I first-in-human trial of bardoxolone methyl in patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2012-05-25,"Bardoxolone methyl, a novel synthetic triterpenoid and antioxidant inflammation modulator, potently induces Nrf2 and inhibits NF-κB and Janus-activated kinase/STAT signaling. This first-in-human phase I clinical trial aimed to determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and appropriate dose for phase II studies; characterize pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters; and assess antitumor activity. Bardoxolone methyl was administered orally once daily for 21 days of a 28-day cycle. An accelerated titration design was employed until a grade 2-related adverse event occurred. A standard 3 + 3 dose escalation was then employed until the MTD was reached. Single dose and steady-state plasma pharmacokinetics of the drug were characterized. Assessment of Nrf2 activation was examined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by measuring NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) mRNA levels. Immunohistochemical assessment of markers of inflammation, cell cycle, and apoptosis was carried out on tumor biopsies. The DLTs were grade 3 reversible liver transaminase elevations. The MTD was established as 900 mg/d. A complete tumor response occurred in a mantle cell lymphoma patient, and a partial response was observed in an anaplastic thyroid carcinoma patient. NQO1 mRNA levels increased in PBMCs, and NF-κB and cyclin D1 levels decreased in tumor biopsies. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was also increased. Bardoxolone methyl was well tolerated with an MTD of 900 mg/d. The increase in eGFR suggests that bardoxolone methyl might be beneficial in chronic kidney disease. Objective tumor responses and pharmacodynamic effects were observed, supporting continued development of other synthetic triterpenoids in cancer.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",2797.0,122.0,Bardoxolone methyl a novel synthetic triterpenoid and antioxidant inflammation modulator potently induces Nrf2 and inhibits NF-κB and Janus-activated kinase/STAT signaling This first-in-human phase I clinical trial aimed to determine the dose-limiting toxicities DLT maximum tolerated dose MTD and appropriate dose for phase II studies characterize pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters and assess antitumor activity Bardoxolone methyl was administered orally once daily for 21 days of a 28-day cycle An accelerated titration design was employed until a grade 2-related adverse event occurred A standard 3 3 dose escalation was then employed until the MTD was reached Single dose and steady-state plasma pharmacokinetics of the drug were characterized Assessment of Nrf2 activation was examined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC by measuring NAD P H quinone oxidoreductase NQO1 mRNA levels Immunohistochemical assessment of markers of inflammation cell cycle and apoptosis was carried out on tumor biopsies The DLTs were grade 3 reversible transaminase elevations The MTD was established as 900 mg/d A complete tumor response occurred in a mantle cell patient and a partial response was observed in an anaplastic carcinoma patient NQO1 mRNA levels increased in PBMCs and NF-κB and cyclin D1 levels decreased in tumor biopsies Estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR was also increased Bardoxolone methyl was well tolerated with an MTD of 900 mg/d The increase in eGFR suggests that bardoxolone methyl might be beneficial in chronic disease Objective tumor responses and pharmacodynamic effects were observed supporting continued development of other synthetic triterpenoids in cancer,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[31976, 5228, 8, 229, 3273, 15818, 2, 5536, 1815, 6318, 4684, 1516, 5731, 2, 1576, 1365, 2448, 2, 6191, 735, 216, 4168, 314, 26, 157, 4, 171, 124, 70, 38, 160, 1295, 6, 223, 3, 61, 817, 385, 2059, 689, 421, 61, 961, 2, 870, 61, 9, 124, 215, 94, 1507, 1456, 2, 2424, 1038, 2, 423, 579, 128, 31976, 5228, 10, 468, 1428, 1059, 391, 9, 239, 162, 1, 8, 339, 218, 417, 35, 2241, 8715, 771, 10, 2516, 1100, 8, 88, 18, 139, 290, 774, 489, 8, 260, 27, 27, 61, 1125, 10, 818, 2516, 1100, 3, 961, 10, 1300, 226, 61, 2, 4152, 1309, 554, 1159, 1, 3, 234, 11, 765, 455, 1, 5731, 363, 10, 409, 4, 672, 315, 3041, 37, 5063, 20, 2978, 11597, 19, 555, 19517, 18836, 10187, 956, 148, 1382, 455, 1, 525, 1, 1815, 31, 417, 2, 351, 10, 2629, 1205, 23, 30, 1154, 3, 2506, 11, 88, 27, 2786, 6997, 4712, 3, 961, 10, 635, 22, 5310, 81, 427, 8, 236, 30, 51, 489, 4, 8, 2757, 31, 69, 2, 8, 450, 51, 10, 164, 4, 35, 1841, 134, 69, 10187, 956, 148, 101, 4, 4617, 2, 1365, 2448, 2, 1226, 2146, 148, 340, 4, 30, 1154, 661, 6080, 5779, 116, 227, 10, 120, 101, 31976, 5228, 10, 149, 421, 5, 35, 961, 1, 5310, 81, 427, 3, 344, 4, 227, 844, 17, 31976, 5228, 822, 40, 2524, 4, 442, 34, 461, 30, 253, 2, 2424, 176, 11, 164, 1912, 1351, 193, 1, 127, 3273, 21985, 4, 12]",1703.0,22634319,19
RAP1GAP inhibits cytoskeletal remodeling and motility in thyroid cancer cells.,Endocrine-related cancer,Endocr. Relat. Cancer,2012-07-22,"The functional significance of decreased RAP1GAP protein expression in human tumors is unclear. To identify targets of RAP1GAP downregulation in the thyroid gland, RAP1 and RAP2 protein expression in human thyroid cells and in primary thyroid tumors were analyzed. RAP1GAP and RAP2 were co-expressed in normal thyroid follicular cells. Intriguingly, RAP1 was not detected in normal thyroid cells, although it was detected in papillary thyroid carcinomas, which also expressed RAP2. Both RAP proteins were detected at the membrane in papillary thyroid tumors, suggesting that they are activated when RAP1GAP is downregulated. To explore the functional significance of RAP1GAP depletion, RAP1GAP was transiently expressed at the lowest level that is sufficient to block endogenous RAP2 activity in papillary and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell lines. RAP1GAP impaired the ability of cells to spread and migrate on collagen. Although RAP1GAP had no effect on protein tyrosine phosphorylation in growing cells, RAP1GAP impaired phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin at sites phosphorylated by SRC in cells acutely plated on collagen. SRC activity was increased in suspended cells, where it was inhibited by RAP1GAP. Inhibition of SRC kinase activity impaired cell spreading and motility.

Although several new drugs have been approved for the treatment of this disease in recent years, mRCC remains incurable. Thus, the search continues for new effective therapies. One such novel compound is axitinib (Inlyta, Pfizer), a potent vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Following phase I testing in advanced solid tumors (where hypertension, stomatitis, and diarrhea were the dose-limiting toxicities), use of axitinib has been further developed through phase II testing in thyroid, breast, lung, and renal cancers. Recently, the phase III AXIS (Axitinib [AG 013736] as Second Line Therapy for Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer) trial demonstrated an improvement in progression-free survival for patients with mRCC who were treated with axitinib versus sorafenib (Nexavar, Bayer) as second-line therapy.

Preclinical studies, followed by a multicenter single arm phase 2 trial of continuously administered 800 mg pazopanib daily by mouth (designed to provide 90% chance of detecting a response rate of >20% at the 0.10 significance level when the true response rate is >5%), were undertaken. The primary trial end point was Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) response. Pazopanib displayed activity in the KTC2 ATC xenograft model, prompting clinical evaluation. Sixteen trial patients were enrolled; 15 were treated: 66.7% were female, median age was 66 yr (range 45-77 yr), and 11 of 15 had progressed through prior systemic therapy. Enrollment was halted, triggered by a stopping rule requiring more than one confirmed RECIST response among the first 14 of 33 potential patients. Four patients required one to two dose reductions; severe toxicities (National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria-Adverse Events version 3.0 grades >3) were hypertension (13%) and pharyngolaryngeal pain (13%). Treatment was discontinued because of the following: disease progression (12 patients), death due to a possibly treatment-related tumor hemorrhage (one patient), and intolerability (radiation recall tracheitis and uncontrolled hypertension, one patient each). Although transient disease regression was observed in several patients, there were no confirmed RECIST responses. Median time to progression was 62 d; median survival time was 111 d. Two patients are alive with disease 9.9 and 35 months after the registration; 13 died of disease.

Vitamin E protects against lipid peroxidation and rescues tumorigenic phenotypes in cowden/cowden-like patient-derived lymphoblast cells with germline SDHx variants.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2012-07-24,"Cowden syndrome (CS), a Mendelian autosomal-dominant disorder, predisposes to breast, thyroid, and other cancers. Germline variations in succinate dehydrogenase genes (SDHx) occur in approximately 10% PTEN mutation-negative CS and CS-like (CSL) individuals (SDH(var+)). We previously showed that SDHx variants result in elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), disruption of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) equilibrium, and destabilization of p53 hence apoptosis resistance in CS/CSL patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells. In the present study, we sought to address the tumorigenic impacts of increased ROS and the potential of protecting SDH(var+) cells with antioxidants. We measured the lipid peroxidation levels in patient-derived SDH(var+) lymphoblastoid cells and sequenced 74 controls or SDH(var+) germline DNA samples for mitochondrial hypervariable region II (HVRII) polymorphisms. SDH(var+) lymphoblastoid cells were treated with various antioxidants to check p53 expression and sub-G(1) cell population with cell-cycle analysis. We showed that elevated ROS results in higher lipid peroxidation in SDH(var+) cells. Accumulation of polymorphisms in mitochondrial HVRII was observed in SDH(var+) samples. Interestingly, α-tocopherol (vitamin E) treatment, but not other antioxidants, rescued SDH(var+) cells from apoptosis resistance and protected SDH(var+) cells from oxidative damage such as decreased lipid peroxidation as well as partially recovered p53 expression and NAD/NADH levels. We conclude that disruption of complex II because of SDHx variants leads to increased ROS generation, specifically accompanied by lipid peroxidation. The lipid soluble antioxidant α-tocopherol can selectively protect SDH(var+) cells from oxidative damage, apoptosis resistance, and rebalance redox metabolites NAD/NADH.",Journal Article,2737.0,16.0,Cowden syndrome CS a Mendelian autosomal-dominant disorder predisposes to and other cancers Germline variations in succinate dehydrogenase genes SDHx occur in approximately 10 PTEN mutation-negative CS and CS-like CSL individuals SDH var+ We previously showed that SDHx variants result in elevated reactive oxygen species ROS disruption of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD equilibrium and destabilization of p53 hence apoptosis resistance in CS/CSL patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells In the present study we sought to address the tumorigenic impacts of increased ROS and the potential of protecting SDH var+ cells with antioxidants We measured the lipid peroxidation levels in patient-derived SDH var+ lymphoblastoid cells and sequenced 74 controls or SDH var+ germline DNA samples for mitochondrial hypervariable region II HVRII polymorphisms SDH var+ lymphoblastoid cells were treated with various antioxidants to check p53 expression and sub-G 1 cell population with cell-cycle analysis We showed that elevated ROS results in higher lipid peroxidation in SDH var+ cells Accumulation of polymorphisms in mitochondrial HVRII was observed in SDH var+ samples Interestingly α-tocopherol vitamin E treatment but not other antioxidants rescued SDH var+ cells from apoptosis resistance and protected SDH var+ cells from oxidative damage such as decreased lipid peroxidation as well as partially recovered p53 expression and NAD/NADH levels We conclude that disruption of complex II because of SDHx variants leads to increased ROS generation specifically accompanied by lipid peroxidation The lipid soluble antioxidant α-tocopherol can selectively protect SDH var+ cells from oxidative damage apoptosis resistance and rebalance redox metabolites NAD/NADH,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[5561, 681, 2188, 8, 12728, 6084, 2156, 2645, 10563, 6, 2, 127, 163, 1009, 2293, 4, 8738, 2374, 214, 8073, 1271, 4, 705, 79, 820, 258, 199, 2188, 2, 2188, 733, 13037, 869, 5672, 13396, 21, 373, 224, 17, 8073, 839, 757, 4, 804, 2163, 2848, 2915, 2609, 3220, 1, 17382, 16307, 11816, 11597, 11614, 2, 19459, 1, 624, 3665, 351, 251, 4, 2188, 13037, 69, 526, 10994, 37, 4, 3, 364, 45, 21, 990, 6, 1539, 3, 3795, 4719, 1, 101, 2609, 2, 3, 174, 1, 11638, 5672, 13396, 37, 5, 10721, 21, 644, 3, 3121, 19117, 148, 4, 69, 526, 5672, 13396, 10994, 37, 2, 4040, 794, 535, 15, 5672, 13396, 1009, 261, 347, 9, 2019, 40055, 1053, 215, 47302, 1203, 5672, 13396, 10994, 37, 11, 73, 5, 747, 10721, 6, 9565, 624, 55, 2, 551, 499, 14, 31, 266, 5, 31, 417, 65, 21, 224, 17, 804, 2609, 99, 4, 142, 3121, 19117, 4, 5672, 13396, 37, 1835, 1, 1203, 4, 2019, 47302, 10, 164, 4, 5672, 13396, 347, 2873, 2014, 12122, 1610, 563, 24, 84, 44, 127, 10721, 7008, 5672, 13396, 37, 29, 351, 251, 2, 5541, 5672, 13396, 37, 29, 3495, 1350, 225, 22, 340, 3121, 19117, 22, 149, 22, 2995, 5784, 624, 55, 2, 11597, 27103, 148, 21, 2060, 17, 3220, 1, 840, 215, 408, 1, 8073, 839, 1940, 6, 101, 2609, 914, 1225, 2756, 20, 3121, 19117, 3, 3121, 2968, 5536, 2014, 12122, 122, 2382, 4869, 5672, 13396, 37, 29, 3495, 1350, 351, 251, 2, 43166, 7237, 3406, 11597, 27103]",1756.0,22829200,10
Larynx-sparing techniques using intensity-modulated radiation therapy for oropharyngeal cancer.,Medical dosimetry : official journal of the American Association of Medical Dosimetrists,Med Dosim,2012-08-21,"The purpose of the current study was to explore whether the laryngeal dose can be reduced by using 2 intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) techniques: whole-neck field IMRT technique (WF-IMRT) vs. junctioned IMRT (J-IMRT). The effect on planning target volumes (PTVs) coverage and laryngeal sparing was evaluated. WF-IMRT technique consisted of a single IMRT plan, including the primary tumor and the superior and inferior neck to the level of the clavicular heads. The larynx was defined as an organ at risk extending superiorly to cover the arytenoid cartilages and inferiorly to include the cricoid cartilage. The J-IMRT technique consisted of an IMRT plan for the primary tumor and the superior neck, matched to conventional antero-posterior opposing lower neck fields at the level of the thyroid notch. A central block was used for the anterior lower neck field at the level of the larynx to restrict the dose to the larynx. Ten oropharyngeal cancer cases were analyzed. Both the primary site and bilateral regional lymphatics were included in the radiotherapy targets. The averaged V95 for the PTV57.6 was 99.2% for the WF-IMRT technique compared with 97.4% (p = 0.02) for J-IMRT.

There is estimated to be more than one and a half million new cases of cancer in 2012, making the development of effective therapies a high priority. As tumor immunologists, we are interested in the development of immunotherapies because the immune response offers exquisite specificity and the potential to target tumor cells without harming normal cells. In this review, we highlight the current advances in the field of immunotherapy and the current work being completed by laboratories at University of Colorado School of Medicine in multiple malignancies, including breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, thyroid cancer, and glioblastoma. This work focuses on augmenting the anti-tumor response of CD8 T cells in the blood, lymph nodes, and tumors of patients, determining biomarkers for patients who are more likely to respond to immunotherapy, and identifying additional anti-tumor and immunosuppressive cells that influence the overall response to tumors.

PTEN lipid phosphatase activity and proper subcellular localization are necessary and sufficient for down-regulating AKT phosphorylation in the nucleus in Cowden syndrome.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2012-09-07,"Germline mutations in PTEN are associated with phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) hamartoma tumor syndrome including Cowden syndrome (CS) and Cowden-like syndrome (CSL) that predisposes to high risks of benign and malignant tumors of thyroid and breast. The objective of the study was to analyze the subcellular pattern of phosphorylated (P)-AKT expression in nonmedullary thyroid cancers from PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome patients and to investigate whether the lack of PTEN in the nucleus and/or lack of proper PTEN function in the nucleus affect(s) nuclear AKT activity in CS patients. In all, 664 patients with CS/CSL were screened for PTEN germline mutations and nonmedullary thyroid cancers. Twenty-two patients who have both pathogenic PTEN germline mutations and nonmedullary thyroid cancers were selected. Thyroid samples from these patients were stained for PTEN and P-AKT. In our in vitro study, PTEN was knocked down or overexpressed in both thyroid cancer cells and breast cancer cells, and nuclear P-AKT was compared with the control. Loss of PTEN protein was found in thyroid adenomas and carcinomas from all 22 (100%) PTEN(Mut+) CS/CSL patients. AKT activation was identified in 17 of 22 (77.3%) thyroid adenoma/carcinoma specimens, and most patients (63.7%) have activated nuclear AKT. Knockdown of PTEN in cells containing wild-type PTEN enhanced nuclear P-AKT, whereas expression of wild-type PTEN, but not phosphatase-dead mutants (C124S or G129E), markedly reduced nuclear P-AKT in PTEN null cells. We also showed that in breast cancer but not thyroid cancer cells, PTEN suppresses nuclear P-AKT mainly through decreasing P-AKT nuclear translocation by reducing the PIP3/P-AKT reservoir in the cytoplasm. In thyroid cancer cells, PTEN suppresses phosphorylation of AKT already resident in the nucleus. PTEN is necessary and sufficient for inhibiting AKT activation in the nucleus through its intact lipid phosphatase activity and proper subcellular localization.",Journal Article,2692.0,15.0,Germline mutations in PTEN are associated with phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome including Cowden syndrome CS and Cowden-like syndrome CSL that predisposes to high risks of benign and malignant tumors of and The objective of the study was to analyze the subcellular pattern of phosphorylated P -AKT expression in nonmedullary cancers from PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome patients and to investigate whether the lack of PTEN in the nucleus and/or lack of proper PTEN function in the nucleus affect s nuclear AKT activity in CS patients In all 664 patients with CS/CSL were screened for PTEN germline mutations and nonmedullary cancers Twenty-two patients who have both pathogenic PTEN germline mutations and nonmedullary cancers were selected samples from these patients were stained for PTEN and P-AKT In our in vitro study PTEN was knocked down or overexpressed in both cancer cells and cancer cells and nuclear P-AKT was compared with the control Loss of PTEN protein was found in adenomas and carcinomas from all 22 100 PTEN Mut+ CS/CSL patients AKT activation was identified in 17 of 22 77.3 adenoma/carcinoma specimens and most patients 63.7 have activated nuclear AKT Knockdown of PTEN in cells containing wild-type PTEN enhanced nuclear P-AKT whereas expression of wild-type PTEN but not phosphatase-dead mutants C124S or G129E markedly reduced nuclear P-AKT in PTEN null cells We also showed that in cancer but not cancer cells PTEN suppresses nuclear P-AKT mainly through decreasing P-AKT nuclear translocation by reducing the PIP3/P-AKT reservoir in the cytoplasm In cancer cells PTEN suppresses phosphorylation of AKT already resident in the nucleus PTEN is necessary and sufficient for inhibiting AKT activation in the nucleus through its intact lipid phosphatase activity and proper subcellular localization,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[1009, 138, 4, 820, 32, 41, 5, 2577, 2, 6111, 3412, 4389, 23, 1170, 79, 820, 8025, 30, 681, 141, 5561, 681, 2188, 2, 5561, 733, 681, 13037, 17, 10563, 6, 64, 1098, 1, 1002, 2, 393, 57, 1, 2, 3, 461, 1, 3, 45, 10, 6, 1992, 3, 7153, 1177, 1, 2365, 19, 649, 55, 4, 18984, 163, 29, 820, 8025, 30, 681, 7, 2, 6, 963, 317, 3, 926, 1, 820, 4, 3, 4262, 2, 15, 926, 1, 4576, 820, 343, 4, 3, 4262, 1158, 695, 928, 649, 128, 4, 2188, 7, 4, 62, 13025, 7, 5, 2188, 13037, 11, 2261, 9, 820, 1009, 138, 2, 18984, 163, 737, 100, 7, 54, 47, 110, 2806, 820, 1009, 138, 2, 18984, 163, 11, 715, 347, 29, 46, 7, 11, 3386, 9, 820, 2, 19, 649, 4, 114, 4, 439, 45, 820, 10, 10237, 1328, 15, 1711, 4, 110, 12, 37, 2, 12, 37, 2, 928, 19, 649, 10, 72, 5, 3, 182, 407, 1, 820, 178, 10, 204, 4, 2751, 2, 826, 29, 62, 350, 394, 820, 3857, 2188, 13037, 7, 649, 363, 10, 108, 4, 269, 1, 350, 849, 27, 2434, 134, 623, 2, 96, 7, 676, 67, 47, 735, 928, 649, 1563, 1, 820, 4, 37, 1101, 955, 267, 820, 651, 928, 19, 649, 547, 55, 1, 955, 267, 820, 84, 44, 2577, 8311, 3423, 61855, 15, 40099, 2195, 405, 928, 19, 649, 4, 820, 3505, 37, 21, 120, 224, 17, 4, 12, 84, 44, 12, 37, 820, 4079, 928, 19, 649, 2615, 298, 2777, 19, 649, 928, 2006, 20, 1818, 3, 47387, 19, 649, 10470, 4, 3, 4558, 4, 12, 37, 820, 4079, 982, 1, 649, 3298, 8185, 4, 3, 4262, 820, 16, 1493, 2, 1952, 9, 2062, 649, 363, 4, 3, 4262, 298, 211, 2964, 3121, 2577, 128, 2, 4576, 7153, 2145]",1870.0,22962422,7

Extreme hypothyroidism associated with sunitinib treatment for metastatic renal cancer.,"Journal of chemotherapy (Florence, Italy)",J Chemother,2012-08-01,"Although thyroid abnormalities are reported with the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, patients rarely require replacement therapy. The initial multicentre studies of sunitinib for metastatic renal cancer did not report hypothyroidism in fatigued patients, and thyroid tests were not  routinely monitored. More recent studies, however, suggest that up to 70% of patients develop thyroid test abnormalities during treatment with sunitinib.

We report a case of a patient with metastatic papillary renal cell cancer on combination anti-angiogenic therapy with sunitinib, who developed unusually high thyroid stimulating hormone levels and severe symptoms despite receiving L-thyroxine.

Utility of PTEN protein dosage in predicting for underlying germline PTEN mutations among patients presenting with thyroid cancer and Cowden-like phenotypes.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2012-10-12,"Thyroid cancer is a major component of Cowden syndrome (CS). CS patients with an underlying PTEN mutation (PTEN(mut+)) have a 70-fold increased risk of developing epithelial thyroid cancer. In contrast, less than 1% of sporadic epithelial thyroid cancer patients carry a germline PTEN mutation. Cost-efficient markers capable of shortlisting thyroid cancers for CS genetic testing would be clinically useful. Our objective was to analyze the utility of patient blood phosphate and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) protein levels in predicting germline PTEN mutations. We conducted a 5-yr, multicenter prospective study of 2792 CS and CS-like patients, all of whom had comprehensive PTEN analysis. Analysis of PTEN and downstream proteins by immunoblotting was performed on total protein lysates from patient-derived lymphoblast lines. We compared blood PTEN protein levels between PTEN(mut+) patients and those with variants of unknown significance or wild-type PTEN (PTEN(wt/vus)). We assessed the utility of PTEN protein levels in predicting germline PTEN mutations. Of 2792 CS/CS-like patients, 721 patients had thyroid cancer; 582 of them (81%) had blood PTEN protein analyzed. PTEN germline pathogenic mutations were present in 27 of 582 patients (4.6%). Ninety-six percent (26 of 27) of PTEN(mut+) patients had blood PTEN protein levels in the lowest quartile as compared with 25% (139 of 555) of PTEN(wt/vus) patients (P < 0.001). Low blood PTEN levels predicted for PTEN(mut+) cases with a 99.76% negative predictive value (95% confidence interval = 98.67-99.96) and a positive test likelihood ratio of 3.84 (95% confidence interval = 3.27-4.52).

Utility of a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor (NVP-BEZ235) for thyroid cancer therapy.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2012-10-15,"We assessed the utility of the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 (BEZ235) as single agent therapy and in combination with conventional chemotherapy for thyroid cancer. Eight cell lines from four types of thyroid cancer (papillary, follicular, anaplastic, medullary) were studied. The cytotoxicity of BEZ235 and five conventional chemotherapeutic agents alone and in combination was measured using LDH assay. Quantitative western blot assessed expression of proteins associated with cell cycle, apoptosis and signaling pathways. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry. Murine flank anaplastic thyroid cancers (ATC) were treated with oral BEZ235 daily. We found that BEZ235 effectively inhibited cell proliferation of all cancer lines, with ATC exhibiting the greatest sensitivity. BEZ235 consistently inactivated signaling downstream of mTORC1. BEZ235 generally induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase, and also caused apoptosis in the most sensitive cell lines. Baseline levels of p-S6 ribosomal protein (Ser235/236) and p27 correlated with BEZ235 sensitivity. Growth of 8505C ATC xenograft tumors was inhibited with BEZ235, without any observed toxicity. Combination therapy of BEZ235 and paclitaxel consistently demonstrated synergistic effects against ATC in vitro.

Thyroid transcription factor-1 expression is an independent predictor of recurrence and correlates with the IASLC/ATS/ERS histologic classification in patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2012-10-23,"In the current study, the authors investigated whether thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) expression is correlated with the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC)/American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) classification and whether it stratifies patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma with respect to disease recurrence. Patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma were classified according to the IASLC/ATS/ERS classification. Tissue microarrays were constructed and immunostaining for TTF-1 was performed. A total of 452 cases were available for analysis. Tumors were dichotomized based on the intensity of nuclear TTF-1 expression as negative (score of 0) or positive (score of 1-3). The cumulative incidence of recurrence (CIR) was used to estimate disease recurrence probabilities. TTF-1 expression was identified in 92% of patients, including 100% of patients with minimally invasive or lepidic-predominant adenocarcinoma, 94% of patients with acinar-predominant adenocarcinoma, 98% of patients with papillary-predominant adenocarcinoma, 93% of patients with micropapillary-predominant adenocarcinoma, 86% of patients with solid-predominant adenocarcinoma, 67% of patients with colloid-predominant adenocarcinoma, and 47% of patients with invasive mucinous carcinoma.

"Regional approaches to the management of patients with advanced, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma.",Expert review of anticancer therapy,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,2012-09-01,"For patients with advanced, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer, current treatment guidelines recommend clinical trial enrollment or small-molecule kinase inhibitor therapy. However, details of patient management vary between countries depending on trial availability and national regulatory policies. Insufficient clinical trial data and variable disease characteristics challenge the creation of universal guidelines, and treatment plans often reflect regional influences. A multidisciplinary, multiregional panel of experts met to discuss regional approaches to managing patients with advanced, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer and the potential impact of emerging therapies on current treatment strategies. Despite process-oriented regional differences, the decision-making strategies were similar.

Phase II trial of sorafenib in patients with advanced anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2013-04-18,"Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare but highly aggressive malignancy with a median survival of 3-5 months. The BRAF oncogene is mutated to its active form in up to 24% of ATC cases. Sorafenib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that acts on the RAF-1 serine/threonine kinase. In preclinical mouse models, sorafenib inhibits the growth of ATC xenografts and improves survival. No study of sorafenib in ATC has been conducted. We conducted a multi-institutional phase II trial of sorafenib in patients with ATC who had failed up to two previous therapies. The primary endpoint of the trial was the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)-defined imaging response rate. Twenty patients with ATC were treated with sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. Two of the 20 patients had a partial response (10%) and an additional 5 of 20 (25%) had stable disease. The duration of response in the two responders was 10 and 27 months, respectively. For the patients with stable disease, the median duration was 4 months (range 3-11 months). The overall median progression-free survival was 1.9 months with a median and a 1-year survival of 3.9 months and 20%, respectively. Toxicity was manageable and as previously described for sorafenib, including hypertension and skin rash. Sorafenib has activity in ATC, but at a low frequency and similar to our previous experience with fosbretabulin. One patient with a response had previously progressed on fosbretabulin.

Should patients with Cowden syndrome undergo prophylactic thyroidectomy?,Surgery,Surgery,2012-12-01,"Cowden syndrome (CS) is dominantly inherited and predisposes patients to tumors in multiple organs. We characterized CS-associated malignant and benign thyroid disease. Of data from 3,477 prospectively recruited CS patients with known genetic analysis, we analyzed 225 PTEN mutation+ patients whose treatment occurred at our center (n = 25) or other hospitals nationwide (n = 200). A total of 32 of 225 PTEN mutation+ patients (14%) had thyroid cancer: 52% papillary, 28% follicular-variant papillary, 14% follicular, and 6% anaplastic. Median age at diagnosis was 35 years compared with 49 years for Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results population data. Initial thyroid ultrasonography in 16 of 25 patients revealed thyroiditis/goiters in all >13 years age, leading to FNA in 7 (64%), thyroidectomy in 3 (27%), and new cancer diagnosis in 2 (18%). Three with severe autism required intraoperative sedation for ultrasonography. A total of 9 of 25 patients were monitored after multiple partial thyroidectomies for goiters by age 42 (n = 5), thyroiditis, or cancer detected by age 36 (n = 3). PTEN mutation+ patients with CS have an enormous prevalence of thyroid disease.

Absolute risk prediction of second primary thyroid cancer among 5-year survivors of childhood cancer.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2012-11-19,"We developed three absolute risk models for second primary thyroid cancer to assist with long-term clinical monitoring of childhood cancer survivors. We used data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) and two nested case-control studies (Nordic CCSS; Late Effects Study Group). Model M1 included self-reported risk factors, model M2 added basic radiation and chemotherapy treatment information abstracted from medical records, and model M3 refined M2 by incorporating reconstructed radiation absorbed dose to the thyroid. All models were validated in an independent cohort of French childhood cancer survivors. M1 included birth year, initial cancer type, age at diagnosis, sex, and past thyroid nodule diagnosis. M2 added radiation (yes/no), radiation to the neck (yes/no), and alkylating agent (yes/no). Past thyroid nodule was consistently the strongest risk factor (M1 relative risk [RR], 10.8; M2 RR, 6.8; M3 RR, 8.2).

Evaluation of romidepsin for clinical activity and radioactive iodine reuptake in radioactive iodine-refractory thyroid carcinoma.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2013-05-01,"Historically, systemic therapy for radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory thyroid cancer has been understudied. Available drugs have modest efficacy. Romidepsin is a histone deacetylase inhibitor with potent antitumor effects both in vitro and in vivo. In thyroid cancer cell lines, romidepsin increases expression of both thyroglobulin and the sodium iodide symporter messenger RNAs, suggesting the possibility of improved iodine concentrating ability of RAI-resistant tumors. This was a single-institution Simon 2-stage phase II clinical study. Eligible patients had progressive, RAI-refractory, recurrent/metastatic, nonmedullary, nonanaplastic thyroid cancer. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0 measurable disease and adequate organ/marrow function were required. Romidepsin 13 mg/m² was administered intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15, in cycles of 28 days. The primary endpoint was the response rate by RECIST; change in RAI avidity was a secondary endpoint. The study closed after the first stage due to the lack of response. Twenty patients were enrolled: female, 50%; median age, 64 years; histology, 8 papillary/1 follicular/11 Hürthle. Grade 4-5 adverse events (AEs) possibly related to the drug: grade 5, 1 sudden death; grade 4, 1 pulmonary embolus. Twelve of 20 subjects had a reported adverse event. No RECIST major responses have been seen. Response per protocol: stable disease, 13; disease progression, 7. Restoration of RAI avidity was documented in two patients. Median overall survival and time on study was 33.2 (1-71+) and 1.7 (0.46-12) months, respectively. We observed preliminary signs of in vivo reversal of RAI resistance after treatment with romidepsin.

Napsin A is differentially expressed in sclerosing hemangiomas of the lung.,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med.,2012-12-01,"Sclerosing hemangiomas (SH) are lung tumors characterized by surface cuboidal cells and round stromal cells. The cell of origin remains controversial, though immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies suggest primitive respiratory epithelium. Napsin A, a human aspartic proteinase found primarily in type II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages, is emerging as a helpful immunohistochemical marker in characterizing the origin of lung neoplasms, and may be of use in evaluating SH. To evaluate napsin A immunohistochemical staining in SH to further characterize the cell of origin. Six cases of SH were stained for napsin A, as well as thyroid transcription factor 1 and cytokeratin in selected cases. Surface and round cells were positive for thyroid transcription factor 1 in all cases stained with this marker. Cytokeratins were positive in surface cells in all cases stained with this marker; 2 cases had focal cytokeratin staining in round cells. Round cells had focal napsin A staining in 1 case (17%); surface cells were napsin positive in all cases. The observation of thyroid transcription factor 1 positivity in both surface and round cells in all SH suggests primitive respiratory epithelium as the cell of origin of SH. Our napsin A findings support this, with positivity in surface cells of all tumors (100%), and focal round cell staining in only 1 (17%). In fact, surface cells may represent entrapped type II pneumocytes, which normally express napsin A in a granular cytoplasmic pattern, similar to surface cells. The coexpression of thyroid transcription factor 1 and napsin A also introduces a caveat in differentiating primary pulmonary adenocarcinomas from SH in small biopsy specimens.",Evaluation Study,2607.0,4.0,Sclerosing hemangiomas SH are tumors characterized by surface cuboidal cells and round stromal cells The cell of origin remains controversial though immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies suggest primitive respiratory epithelium Napsin A a human aspartic proteinase found primarily in type II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages is emerging as a helpful immunohistochemical marker in characterizing the origin of neoplasms and may be of use in evaluating SH To evaluate napsin A immunohistochemical staining in SH to further characterize the cell of origin Six cases of SH were stained for napsin A as well as transcription factor 1 and cytokeratin in selected cases Surface and round cells were positive for transcription factor 1 in all cases stained with this marker Cytokeratins were positive in surface cells in all cases stained with this marker 2 cases had focal cytokeratin staining in round cells Round cells had focal napsin A staining in 1 case 17 surface cells were napsin positive in all cases The observation of transcription factor 1 positivity in both surface and round cells in all SH suggests primitive respiratory epithelium as the cell of origin of SH Our napsin A findings support this with positivity in surface cells of all tumors 100 and focal round cell staining in only 1 17 In fact surface cells may represent entrapped type II pneumocytes which normally express napsin A in a granular cytoplasmic pattern similar to surface cells The coexpression of transcription factor 1 and napsin A also introduces a caveat in differentiating primary pulmonary adenocarcinomas from SH in small biopsy specimens,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[6782, 11984, 9225, 32, 57, 765, 20, 1255, 31853, 37, 2, 4436, 1126, 37, 3, 31, 1, 1938, 469, 2010, 2471, 1382, 2, 13755, 94, 309, 5594, 2718, 2781, 11883, 8, 8, 171, 14762, 10974, 204, 1561, 4, 267, 215, 25967, 2, 5641, 2748, 16, 1478, 22, 8, 3951, 1382, 952, 4, 5723, 3, 1938, 1, 1179, 2, 68, 40, 1, 119, 4, 1435, 9225, 6, 376, 11883, 8, 1382, 1029, 4, 9225, 6, 195, 1507, 3, 31, 1, 1938, 437, 140, 1, 9225, 11, 3386, 9, 11883, 8, 22, 149, 22, 866, 161, 14, 2, 4292, 4, 715, 140, 1255, 2, 4436, 37, 11, 109, 9, 866, 161, 14, 4, 62, 140, 3386, 5, 26, 952, 13008, 11, 109, 4, 1255, 37, 4, 62, 140, 3386, 5, 26, 952, 18, 140, 42, 2137, 4292, 1029, 4, 4436, 37, 4436, 37, 42, 2137, 11883, 8, 1029, 4, 14, 473, 269, 1255, 37, 11, 11883, 109, 4, 62, 140, 3, 1664, 1, 866, 161, 14, 1887, 4, 110, 1255, 2, 4436, 37, 4, 62, 9225, 844, 5594, 2718, 2781, 22, 3, 31, 1, 1938, 1, 9225, 114, 11883, 8, 272, 538, 26, 5, 1887, 4, 1255, 37, 1, 62, 57, 394, 2, 2137, 4436, 31, 1029, 4, 158, 14, 269, 4, 1991, 1255, 37, 68, 1231, 20439, 267, 215, 25967, 92, 6150, 1669, 11883, 8, 4, 8, 7694, 2828, 1177, 288, 6, 1255, 37, 3, 7588, 1, 866, 161, 14, 2, 11883, 8, 120, 13090, 8, 23559, 4, 5209, 86, 1087, 1586, 29, 9225, 4, 302, 411, 623]",1635.0,23194051,162
Tumor suppressor function of the plasma glutathione peroxidase gpx3 in colitis-associated carcinoma.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2012-12-05,"The glutathione peroxidases, a family of selenocysteine-containing redox enzymes, play pivotal roles in balancing the signaling, immunomodulatory, and deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The glutathione peroxidase GPX3 is the only extracellular member of this family, suggesting it may defend cells against ROS in the extracellular environment. Notably, GPX3 hypermethylation and underexpression occur commonly in prostate, gastric, cervical, thyroid, and colon cancers. We took a reverse genetics approach to investigate whether GPX3 would augment inflammatory colonic tumorigenesis, a process characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation, comparing Gpx3(-/-) mice in an established two-stage model of inflammatory colon carcinogenesis. Gpx3-deficient mice exhibited an increased tumor number, though not size, along with a higher degree of dysplasia. In addition, they exhibited increased inflammation with redistribution toward protumorigenic M2 macrophage subsets, increased proliferation, hyperactive WNT signaling, and increased DNA damage. To determine the impact of acute gene loss in an established colon cancer line, we silenced GPX3 in human Caco2 cells, resulting in increased ROS production, DNA damage and apoptosis in response to oxidative stress, combined with decreased contact-independent growth. Taken together, our results suggested an immunomodulatory role for GPX3 that limits the development of colitis-associated carcinoma.",Journal Article,2603.0,69.0,The glutathione peroxidases a family of selenocysteine-containing redox enzymes play pivotal roles in balancing the signaling immunomodulatory and deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species ROS The glutathione peroxidase GPX3 is the only extracellular member of this family suggesting it may defend cells against ROS in the extracellular environment Notably GPX3 hypermethylation and underexpression occur commonly in and cancers We took a reverse genetics approach to investigate whether GPX3 would augment inflammatory colonic tumorigenesis a process characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation comparing Gpx3 -/- mice in an established two-stage model of inflammatory carcinogenesis Gpx3-deficient mice exhibited an increased tumor number though not size along with a higher degree of dysplasia In addition they exhibited increased inflammation with redistribution toward protumorigenic M2 macrophage subsets increased proliferation hyperactive WNT signaling and increased DNA damage To determine the impact of acute gene loss in an established cancer line we silenced GPX3 in human Caco2 cells resulting in increased ROS production DNA damage and apoptosis in response to oxidative stress combined with decreased contact-independent growth Taken together our results suggested an immunomodulatory role for GPX3 that limits the development of colitis-associated carcinoma,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,"[3, 4571, 62179, 8, 607, 1, 32054, 1101, 7237, 3039, 1343, 3754, 1790, 4, 13013, 3, 314, 2555, 2, 3586, 176, 1, 2163, 2848, 2915, 2609, 3, 4571, 14747, 18037, 16, 3, 158, 1976, 2693, 1, 26, 607, 802, 192, 68, 38012, 37, 480, 2609, 4, 3, 1976, 3087, 2552, 18037, 2575, 2, 22250, 1271, 841, 4, 2, 163, 21, 5060, 8, 1772, 2894, 353, 6, 963, 317, 18037, 688, 4369, 1291, 3663, 1565, 8, 1129, 765, 20, 3495, 1531, 2, 1815, 1430, 18037, 399, 4, 35, 635, 100, 82, 202, 1, 1291, 1719, 18037, 1971, 399, 1416, 35, 101, 30, 207, 2471, 44, 444, 1510, 5, 8, 142, 1444, 1, 2253, 4, 352, 491, 1416, 101, 1815, 5, 12507, 1317, 11840, 821, 2674, 1890, 101, 457, 11802, 2112, 314, 2, 101, 261, 1350, 6, 223, 3, 345, 1, 286, 145, 407, 4, 35, 635, 12, 328, 21, 5442, 18037, 4, 171, 26171, 37, 1113, 4, 101, 2609, 1529, 261, 1350, 2, 351, 4, 51, 6, 3495, 1531, 397, 5, 340, 4393, 306, 129, 1633, 1162, 114, 99, 1148, 35, 2555, 200, 9, 18037, 17, 3526, 3, 193, 1, 4132, 41, 134]",1385.0,23221387,70
Surgeon training and use of radioactive iodine in stage I thyroid cancer patients.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2012-12-06,"The majority of thyroid cancer diagnoses in the United States are stage I well-differentiated cancer. The use of radioactive iodine (RAI) in these low-risk patients has increased over time. The role of surgeon training in decision making regarding treatment with RAI is unknown. Thyroid surgeons affiliated with 368 hospitals associated with the US National Cancer Database (NCDB) were surveyed. Survey data were linked to the NCDB data. A multivariable weighted analysis controlling for surgeon and hospital characteristics was conducted to examine the relationship between surgeon training, continuing education and hospital-level RAI use for stage I well-differentiated thyroid cancer. The response rate was 70% (560 of 804). In both univariate and multivariable analysis controlling for hospital case volume, practice setting and surgeon specialty, training with a thyroid surgeon was associated with less RAI use for stage I thyroid cancer (P = 0.022 and 0.028, respectively).

Prognostic significance of thyroid or cricoid cartilage invasion in laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer treated with organ preserving strategies.,"Radiation oncology (London, England)",Radiat Oncol,2012-12-21,"The utility of definitive radiotherapy (RT) for locoregionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the larynx or hypopharynx in the setting of thyroid or cricoid cartilage invasion (TCCI) is controversial.

We identified 87 patients with T3-4 laryngeal or T4 hypopharyngeal cancer for whom initial head and neck imaging was available for review. Imaging of all patients was reviewed by a single radiologist specializing in neuroradiology. The presence and extent of TCCI was determined and used for stratification. Median follow-up was 34 months. TCCI was found in 25 (29%) patients, eight limited to the inner cortex and another 17 involving both cortices. Local control (LC) was not significantly affected by TCCI limited to the inner cortex. However, TCCI involving both cortices was correlated with diminished LC at 2 years compared to the group of patients with no or minor invasion (55% vs. 81%, p=0.045). However, TCCI involving both cortices was not associated with significantly reduced rates of survival with a functional larynx, or overall survival (OS).

A phase I study of liposomal-encapsulated docetaxel (LE-DT) in patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies.,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol.,2012-12-30,"Docetaxel is a taxane anticancer drug used in a wide variety of solid tumors. Liposomes are versatile drug carriers that may increase drug solubility, serve as sustained release systems, provide protection from drug degradation and toxicities, and help overcome multidrug resistance. This phase I study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), pharmacokinetics (PK), and clinical response of liposomal-encapsulated docetaxel (LE-DT) in patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies. LE-DT was administered using a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation schema with dose levels of 50, 65, 85, 110, and 132 mg/m(2) IV on a 3-week cycle. Toxicities were assessed using the NCI-CTCAE version 3.0, and response was assessed using RECIST criteria (version 1.0). PK samples were drawn during cycle 1 and analyzed using a non-compartmental analysis. Twenty-four patients were treated for 1-30 cycles (median = 4). No DLTs were experienced through dose levels of 50, 65, 85, and 110 mg/m(2). Two out of two patients experienced grade 4 neutropenia at the 132 mg/m(2) dose level. When an additional three patients were treated at the expanded 110 mg/m(2) dose level, two experienced grade 4 neutropenia. The 85 mg/m(2) dose level was reassessed with an expanded group of three additional patients, and only one of three patients experienced grade 4 neutropenia.

KX2-391 is a synthetic, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Src tyrosine kinase (TK) signaling and tubulin polymerization. This compound is distinct from other Src kinase inhibitors by targeting the peptide substrate rather than the ATP binding site; the binding site on hetero-dimeric tubulin is novel and distinct from the taxanes and other known tubulin inhibitors. This multicenter Phase I trial utilized a 4 + 2 study design to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of KX2-391 in patients with refractory solid tumors. Forty-four (44) patients (18 M, 26 F; median age, 59) were enrolled in 9 dose cohorts. Dose-limiting toxicities, all reversible within 7 days, occurred in 7 patients and consisted of elevated AST (n = 4), ALT (n = 2), neutropenia (n = 1), thrombocytopenia (n = 1), failure to thrive (n = 1) and anorexia (n = 1). The MTD is 40 mg BID continuously. Eleven patients had stable disease for ≥ 4 months, including patients with ovarian, carcinoid, papillary thyroid, prostate, pancreas and head and neck cancer. Patients with prostate and pancreatic cancer also had significant biomarker decreases (PSA, 205 ng/mL to 39 ng/mL; CA19-9, 38,838 U/mL to 267 U/mL).

Relief of feedback inhibition of HER3 transcription by RAF and MEK inhibitors attenuates their antitumor effects in BRAF-mutant thyroid carcinomas.,Cancer discovery,Cancer Discov,2013-01-29,"The RAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) increases survival in patients with BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma, but has limited efficacy in patients with colorectal cancers. Thyroid cancer cells are also comparatively refractory to RAF inhibitors. In contrast to melanomas, inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling by PLX4032 is transient in thyroid and colorectal cancer cells. The rebound in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in thyroid cells is accompanied by increased HER3 signaling caused by induction of ERBB3 (HER3) transcription through decreased promoter occupancy by the transcriptional repressors C-terminal binding protein 1 and 2 and by autocrine secretion of neuregulin-1 (NRG1). The HER kinase inhibitor lapatinib prevents MAPK rebound and sensitizes BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer cells to RAF or MAP-ERK kinase inhibitors. This provides a rationale for combining ERK pathway antagonists with inhibitors of feedback-reactivated HER signaling in this disease.

Selumetinib-enhanced radioiodine uptake in advanced thyroid cancer.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2013-02-01,"Metastatic thyroid cancers that are refractory to radioiodine (iodine-131) are associated with a poor prognosis. In mouse models of thyroid cancer, selective mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway antagonists increase the expression of the sodium-iodide symporter and uptake of iodine. Their effects in humans are not known. We conducted a study to determine whether the MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and MEK2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) could reverse refractoriness to radioiodine in patients with metastatic thyroid cancer. After stimulation with thyrotropin alfa, dosimetry with iodine-124 positron-emission tomography (PET) was performed before and 4 weeks after treatment with selumetinib (75 mg twice daily). If the second iodine-124 PET study indicated that a dose of iodine-131 of 2000 cGy or more could be delivered to the metastatic lesion or lesions, therapeutic radioiodine was administered while the patient was receiving selumetinib. Of 24 patients screened for the study, 20 could be evaluated. The median age was 61 years (range, 44 to 77), and 11 patients were men. Nine patients had tumors with BRAF mutations, and 5 patients had tumors with mutations of NRAS. Selumetinib increased the uptake of iodine-124 in 12 of the 20 patients (4 of 9 patients with BRAF mutations and 5 of 5 patients with NRAS mutations). Eight of these 12 patients reached the dosimetry threshold for radioiodine therapy, including all 5 patients with NRAS mutations. Of the 8 patients treated with radioiodine, 5 had confirmed partial responses and 3 had stable disease; all patients had decreases in serum thyroglobulin levels (mean reduction, 89%). No toxic effects of grade 3 or higher attributable by the investigators to selumetinib were observed. One patient received a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome more than 51 weeks after radioiodine treatment, with progression to acute leukemia. Selumetinib produces clinically meaningful increases in iodine uptake and retention in a subgroup of patients with thyroid cancer that is refractory to radioiodine; the effectiveness may be greater in patients with RAS-mutant disease.

"Extranodal extension of metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma: correlation with biochemical endpoints, nodal persistence, and systemic disease progression.",Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2013-09-01,"The impact of extranodal extension (ENE) of metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) on short- and long-term clinical outcomes, including biochemical testing, has not been reported. This single-institution National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center cohort study included patients with macroscopic metastases and excluded patients with gross residual disease after surgery, distant disease, or poorly differentiated papillary carcinoma. A suppressed or stimulated thyroglobulin (Tg) < 1 ng/mL, without suspicious imaging or anti-thyroglobulin antibodies, after radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment was termed an excellent or ""complete biochemical response"" (CR). Of 89 subjects included, 60 previously untreated patients underwent total thyroidectomy and therapeutic neck dissection; 29 additional patients underwent a neck dissection for persistence or recurrence after prior surgery and RAI administration. ENE, identified in 29 patients (33%), was associated with T4 classification (p = 0.02) and involvement of a greater number of nodes (median 11 vs. 5, p = 0.03). ENE was associated with a 20% increased risk of nodal persistence necessitating additional surgery (p = 0.02). In a multivariable analysis, ENE, T4 classification, and recurrence/persistence proved to be independent predictors of systemic disease progression (ENE: hazard ratio [HR] 4.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-15], p = 0.02; T4 classification: HR 4.2 [CI 1.3-14], p = 0.01; recurrent/persistent status: HR 3.6 [CI 1.1-12], p = 0.035). Nodal or systemic disease progression was rare after a biochemical CR; in contrast, in previously untreated patients, stimulated Tg levels (sTg) > 50 ng/mL prior to initial RAI administration, heralded the progression of nodal disease, and also predicted the eventual development of systemic disease (p = 0.0001). Of those with a sTg > 50 ng/mL, over 70% underwent surgery for nodal persistence within five years. The presence of ENE diminished the odds of a biochemical CR (odds ratio 3.5% [CI 1.3-10], p = 0.02), and increased the probability that the sTg levels after surgery will exceed 50 ng/mL (odds ratio 5 [CI 1.2-21], p = 0.03). Following surgery for tumor persistence, 25% of those with ENE were rendered biochemically free of disease. ENE diminishes the probability of a biochemical CR after treatment for regional metastatic PTC, and increases the probability of tumor persistence after initial resection, likely from abundant metastasis.

The role of recombinant human thyrotropin for diagnostic monitoring of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.,Endocrine practice : official journal of the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists,Endocr Pract,,"To describe the evolving role of recombinant human thyrotropin in the diagnostic evaluation of patients treated for differentiated thyroid carcinoma. A systematic review was performed of published English language articles appearing in PubMed using terms ""recombinant thyrotropin"" and ""thyroid cancer"". The author selected articles for inclusion based upon potential for clinical impact of the reported findings. The addition of recombinant human thyrotropin to diagnostic testing replaced the requirement for thyroid hormone withdrawal and symptomatic hypothyroidism that had been necessary to generate sufficient endogenous thyrotropin for radioiodine scanning and thyroglobulin testing.

Clinical responses to vemurafenib in patients with metastatic papillary thyroid cancer harboring BRAF(V600E) mutation.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2013-07-17,"Clinical benefit from cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is disappointing, and effective therapeutic approaches for these patients are urgently needed. Because kinase-activating mutations in the BRAF proto-oncogene commonly occur in advanced PTC, and inhibition of BRAF(V600E) has shown promising clinical activity in melanoma, BRAF inhibitor therapy may be an effective strategy to treat metastatic PTC. The dose escalation portion of a first-in-human, phase I study of vemurafenib, a selective RAF inhibitor, included three patients with metastatic PTC harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation. Vemurafenib was initially dosed at 240-360 mg twice a day, later escalated to 720 mg twice a day. Response evaluation was performed every 8 weeks per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Among the three patients, one had a confirmed partial response with reduction of pulmonary target lesions by 31%, and the duration of response was 7.6 months before the disease progressed in the lungs and the bones. The time to progression was 11.7 months. The other two patients had stable disease, and the time to progression was 13.2 and 11.4 months, respectively. Vemurafenib appears to have a promising clinical activity in patients with metastatic PTC, and our data suggest that the BRAF(V600E) mutant kinase is a relevant target for therapy in this patient population.

The increasing incidence of thyroid cancer: the influence of access to care.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2013-04-18,"The rapidly rising incidence of papillary thyroid cancer may be due to overdiagnosis of a reservoir of subclinical disease. To conclude that overdiagnosis is occurring, evidence for an association between access to health care and the incidence of cancer is necessary. We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data to examine U.S. papillary thyroid cancer incidence trends in Medicare-age and non-Medicare-age cohorts over three decades. We performed an ecologic analysis across 497 U.S. counties, examining the association of nine county-level socioeconomic markers of health care access and the incidence of papillary thyroid cancer. Papillary thyroid cancer incidence is rising most rapidly in Americans over age 65 years (annual percentage change, 8.8%), who have broad health insurance coverage through Medicare. Among those under 65, in whom health insurance coverage is not universal, the rate of increase has been slower (annual percentage change, 6.4%). Over three decades, the mortality rate from thyroid cancer has not changed. Across U.S. counties, incidence ranged widely, from 0 to 29.7 per 100,000. County papillary thyroid cancer incidence was significantly correlated with all nine sociodemographic markers of health care access: it was positively correlated with rates of college education, white-collar employment, and family income; and negatively correlated with the percentage of residents who were uninsured, in poverty, unemployed, of nonwhite ethnicity, non-English speaking, and lacking high school education. Markers for higher levels of health care access, both sociodemographic and age-based, are associated with higher papillary thyroid cancer incidence rates. More papillary thyroid cancers are diagnosed among populations with wider access to healthcare. Despite the threefold increase in incidence over three decades, the mortality rate remains unchanged.

Physicians were asked questions in the following four domains: thyroid surgery, radioactive iodine use, thyroid hormone replacement postsurgery, and long-term thyroid cancer management. We calculated the ratio of observed variation to hypothetical maximum variation under the assumed distribution of the response. Ratios closer to 1 indicate greater variation.

Genomic dissection of Hurthle cell carcinoma reveals a unique class of thyroid malignancy.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2013-03-29,"Hurthle cell cancer (HCC) is an understudied cancer with poor prognosis. Our objective was to elucidate the genomic foundations of HCC. We conducted a large-scale integrated analysis of mutations, gene expression profiles, and copy number alterations in HCC at a single tertiary-care cancer institution. Mass spectrometry-based genotyping was used to interrogate hot spot point mutations in the most common thyroid oncogenes: BRAF, RET, NRAS, HRAS, KRAS, PIK3CA, MAP2K1, and AKT1. In addition, common oncogenic fusions of RET and NTRK1 as well as PAX8/PPARγ and AKAP9-BRAF were also assessed by RT-PCR. Global copy number changes and gene expression profiles were determined in the same tumor set as the mutational analyses. We report that the mutational, transcriptional, and copy number profiles of HCC were distinct from those of papillary thyroid cancer and follicular thyroid cancer, indicating HCC to be a unique type of thyroid malignancy. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of gene expression showed the 3 groups of Hurthle tumors (Hurthle cell adenoma [HA], minimally invasive Hurthle cell carcinoma [HMIN], and widely invasive Hurthle cell carcinoma [HWIDE] clustered separately with a marked difference between HWIDE and HA.

Identification of targetable FGFR gene fusions in diverse cancers.,Cancer discovery,Cancer Discov,2013-04-04,"Through a prospective clinical sequencing program for advanced cancers, four index cases were identified which harbor gene rearrangements of FGFR2, including patients with cholangiocarcinoma, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. After extending our assessment of FGFR rearrangements across multiple tumor cohorts, we identified additional FGFR fusions with intact kinase domains in lung squamous cell cancer, bladder cancer, thyroid cancer, oral cancer, glioblastoma, and head and neck squamous cell cancer. All FGFR fusion partners tested exhibit oligomerization capability, suggesting a shared mode of kinase activation. Overexpression of FGFR fusion proteins induced cell proliferation. Two bladder cancer cell lines that harbor FGFR3 fusion proteins exhibited enhanced susceptibility to pharmacologic inhibition in vitro and in vivo.

To determine the relationships between surgeon recommendations for extent of resection and radioactive iodine use in low-risk thyroid cancer. There has been an increase in thyroid cancer treatment intensity; the relationship between extent of resection and medical treatment with radioactive iodine remains unknown. We randomly surveyed thyroid surgeons affiliated with 368 hospitals with Commission on Cancer-accredited cancer programs. Survey responses were linked to the National Cancer Database. The relationship between extent of resection and the proportion of the American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I well-differentiated thyroid cancer patients treated with radioactive iodine after total thyroidectomy was assessed with multivariable weighted regression, controlling for hospital and surgeon characteristics. The survey response rate was 70% (560/804). Surgeons who recommend total thyroidectomy over lobectomy for subcentimeter unifocal thyroid cancer were significantly more likely to recommend prophylactic central lymph node dissection for thyroid cancer regardless of tumor size (P < 0.001). They were also more likely to favor radioactive iodine in patients with intrathyroidal unifocal cancer ≤1 cm (P = 0.001), 1.1-2 cm (P = 0.004), as well as intrathyroidal multifocal cancer ≤1 cm (P = 0.004). In multivariable analysis, high hospital case volume, fewer surgeon years of experience, general surgery specialty, and preference for more extensive resection were independently associated with greater hospital-level use of radioactive iodine for stage I disease.

Patient deaths specifically caused by PTC. Overall, mortality was 5.3% (45/845; 95% CI, 3.9%-7.1%) vs 1.1% (11/1004; 95% CI, 0.5%-2.0%) (P < .001) in BRAF V600E-positive vs mutation-negative patients.

Evolving approaches to patients with advanced differentiated thyroid cancer.,Endocrine reviews,Endocr. Rev.,2013-04-10,"Advanced differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), defined by clinical characteristics including gross extrathyroidal invasion, distant metastases, radioiodine (RAI) resistance, and avidity for 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (positron emission tomography-positive), is found in approximately 10-20% of patients with DTC. Standard therapy (surgery, RAI, TSH suppression with levothyroxine) is ineffective for many of these patients, as is standard chemotherapy. Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to DTC and the transformation to advanced DTC has rapidly evolved over the past 15-20 years. Newer targeted therapy, specifically inhibitors of intracellular kinase signaling pathways, and cooperative multicenter clinical trials have dramatically changed the therapeutic landscape for patients with advanced DTC.

DNA fragmentation factor 45 and TTF-1 expression was significantly higher in gallbladder adenocarcinomas than in the corresponding peritumoral tissues (χ²DFF45 = 6.92, χ²TTF-1 = 8.68, ps < 0.01), polyps (χ²DFF45 = 4.49, χ²TTF-1 = 5.35, ps < 0.05), and chronic cholecystitis (χ²DFF45 = 12.98, χ²TTF-1 = 17.74, ps < 0.01). Negative expression of DFF45 and TTF-1 was significantly associated with tumor differentiation, tumor mass, lymph node metastasis and invasion of adenocarcinomas (p < 0.05). Univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that elevated expression levels of DFF45 and TTF-1 (p < 0.05) were closely associated with increased overall survival. In addition, the average survival time of patients with DFF45(+) TTF-1(+) tumors was significantly higher than those with DFF45(-) TTF-1(-) tumors (p < 0.05). Finally, multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that negative expression of DFF45 and TTF-1 was an independent prognostic predictor in gallbladder adenocarcinoma (p < 0.05).

Phase 1 study of dose escalation in hypofractionated proton beam therapy for non-small cell lung cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2013-05-18,"Many patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cannot undergo concurrent chemotherapy because of comorbidities or poor performance status. Hypofractionated radiation regimens, if tolerable, may provide an option to these patients for effective local control. Twenty-five patients were enrolled in a phase 1 dose-escalation trial of proton beam therapy (PBT) from September 2010 through July 2012. Eligible patients had histologically documented lung cancer, thymic tumors, carcinoid tumors, or metastatic thyroid tumors. Concurrent chemotherapy was not allowed, but concurrent treatment with biologic agents was. The dose-escalation schema comprised 15 fractions of 3 Gy(relative biological effectiveness [RBE])/fraction, 3.5 Gy(RBE)/fraction, or 4 Gy(RBE)/fraction. Dose constraints were derived from biologically equivalent doses of standard fractionated treatment. The median follow-up time for patients alive at the time of analysis was 13 months (range, 8-28 months). Fifteen patients received treatment to hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes. Two patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity possibly related to treatment; 1 received 3.5-Gy(RBE) fractions and experienced an in-field tracheoesophageal fistula 9 months after PBT and 1 month after bevacizumab.

We analyzed data on risk factors and outcomes of 642 children with SMNs occurring after treatment for ALL from 18 collaborative study groups between 1980 and 2007. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 186), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n = 69), and nonmeningioma brain tumor (n = 116) were the most common types of SMNs and had the poorest outcome (5-year survival rate, 18.1% ± 2.9%, 31.1% ± 6.2%, and 18.3% ± 3.8%, respectively). Five-year survival estimates for AML were 11.2% ± 2.9% for 125 patients diagnosed before 2000 and 34.1% ± 6.3% for 61 patients diagnosed after 2000 (P < .001); 5-year survival estimates for MDS were 17.1% ± 6.4% (n = 36) and 48.2% ± 10.6% (n = 33; P = .005). Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation failed to improve outcome of secondary myeloid malignancies after adjusting for waiting time to transplantation. Five-year survival rates were above 90% for patients with meningioma, Hodgkin lymphoma, thyroid carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and parotid gland tumor, and 68.5% ± 6.4% for those with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Eighty-nine percent of patients with brain tumors had received cranial irradiation.

Randomized safety and efficacy study of fosbretabulin with paclitaxel/carboplatin against anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2013-09-10,"Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), a rare highly vascularized tumor, has a dismal outcome. We conducted an open-label study of doublet carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy with or without fosbretabulin in patients with ATC. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to 6 cycles of paclitaxel 200 mg/m(2) followed by carboplatin AUC 6 on day 1 every 3 weeks (CP), or these drugs were given on day 2 after fosbretabulin 60 mg/m(2) (CP/fosbretabulin) on days 1, 8 and 15. After 6 cycles, patients on the fosbretabulin arm without progression could continue to receive fosbretabulin on days 1 and 8 of a 3-week schedule until progression. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Eighty patients were assigned (planned, 180) when enrollment was stopped due to rarity of disease and very low accrual. Median OS was 5.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.1, 9.0] for the CP/fosbretabulin arm (n=55; hazard ratio 0.73 [95% CI 0.44, 1.21]) and 4.0 months [95% CI 2.8, 6.2] for the CP arm (n=25; p=0.22 [log rank test]). One-year survival for CP/fosbretabulin versus CP was 26% versus 9%, respectively. There was no significant difference in progression-free survival between the two arms. Grade 1-2 hypertension and grade 3-4 neutropenia were more common with CP/fosbretabulin. There were no significant adverse cardiovascular side effects. Although the study did not meet statistical significance in improvement in OS with the addition of fosbretabulin to carboplatin/paclitaxel, it represents the largest prospective randomized trial ever conducted in ATC.

Prognosis of differentiated thyroid cancer in relation to serum thyrotropin and thyroglobulin antibody status at time of diagnosis.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2013-09-04,"Serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration and thyroid autoimmunity may be of prognostic importance in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Preoperative serum TSH level has been associated with higher DTC stage in cross-sectional studies; data are contradictory on the significance of thyroid autoimmunity at the time of diagnosis. We sought to assess whether preoperative serum TSH and perioperative antithyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) were associated with thyroid cancer stage and outcome in DTC patients followed by the National Thyroid Cancer Treatment Cooperative Study, a large multicenter thyroid cancer registry. Patients registered after 1996 with available preoperative serum TSH (n=617; the TSH cohort) or perioperative TgAb status (n=1770; the TgAb cohort) were analyzed for tumor stage, persistent disease, recurrence, and overall survival (OS; median follow-up, 5.5 years). Parametric tests assessed log-transformed TSH, and categorical variables were tested with chi square. Disease-free survival (DFS) and OS was assessed with Cox models. Geometric mean serum TSH levels were higher in patients with higher-stage disease (Stage III/IV=1.48 vs. 1.02 mU/L for Stages I/II; p=0.006). The relationship persisted in those aged ≥45 years after adjusting for sex (p=0.01). Gross extrathyroidal extension (p=0.03) and presence of cervical lymph node metastases (p=0.003) were also significantly associated with higher serum TSH. Disease recurrence and all-cause mortality occurred in 37 and 38 TSH cohort patients respectively, which limited the power for survival analysis. Positive TgAb was associated with lower stage on univariate analysis (positive TgAb in 23.4% vs. 17.8% of Stage I/II vs. III/IV patients, respectively; p=0.01), although the relationship lost significance when adjusting for age and sex (p=0.34).

"Landscape of DNA virus associations across human malignant cancers: analysis of 3,775 cases using RNA-Seq.",Journal of virology,J. Virol.,2013-06-05,"Elucidation of tumor-DNA virus associations in many cancer types has enhanced our knowledge of fundamental oncogenesis mechanisms and provided a basis for cancer prevention initiatives. RNA-Seq is a novel tool to comprehensively assess such associations. We interrogated RNA-Seq data from 3,775 malignant neoplasms in The Cancer Genome Atlas database for the presence of viral sequences. Viral integration sites were also detected in expressed transcripts using a novel approach. The detection capacity of RNA-Seq was compared to available clinical laboratory data. Human papillomavirus (HPV) transcripts were detected using RNA-Seq analysis in head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma, uterine endometrioid carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Detection of HPV by RNA-Seq correlated with detection by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in squamous cell carcinoma tumors of the head and neck. Hepatitis B virus and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were detected using RNA-Seq in hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric carcinoma tumors, respectively. Integration sites of viral genes and oncogenes were detected in cancers harboring HPV or hepatitis B virus but not in EBV-positive gastric carcinoma. Integration sites of expressed viral transcripts frequently involved known coding areas of the host genome. No DNA virus transcripts were detected in acute myeloid leukemia, cutaneous melanoma, low- and high-grade gliomas of the brain, and adenocarcinomas of the breast, colon and rectum, lung, prostate, ovary, kidney, and thyroid. In conclusion, this study provides a large-scale overview of the landscape of DNA viruses in human malignant cancers. While further validation is necessary for specific cancer types, our findings highlight the utility of RNA-Seq in detecting tumor-associated DNA viruses and identifying viral integration sites that may unravel novel mechanisms of cancer pathogenesis.

"The results of selective use of radioactive iodine on survival and on recurrence in the management of papillary thyroid cancer, based on Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk group stratification.",Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2013-06-01,"The American Thyroid Association guidelines recommend the routine use of radioactive iodine for remnant ablation (RRA) in all T3 or greater primary tumors, and selective use in patients with intrathyroidal disease >1 cm, or evidence of nodal metastases. The guidelines recognize that there is conflicting and inadequate data to make firm recommendations for most patients. The aim of this study was to analyze our institutional experience of the use of RRA in the management of papillary thyroid cancer, with a particular focus on outcomes for those patients selected not to receive RRA. We retrospectively reviewed 1129 consecutive patients who underwent total thyroidectomy at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between 1986 and 2005. Of these, 490 were pT1-2 N0, 193 pT1-2 N1, and 444 pT3-4. Details on recurrence and disease-specific survival were recorded by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. The five-year disease-specific survival and recurrence-free survival in the pT1/T2 N0, pT1-2 N1, and pT3-4 were 100% and 92%, 100% and 92%, and 98% and 87% respectively. Low-risk patients who were managed without RRA (who tended to have limited primary disease, pT1-2, and low-volume metastatic disease in the neck, pT1-2 N1-fewer than five nodes, all <1 cm greatest dimension) had five-year recurrence-free survival of >97%. In the group with advanced local tumors (pT3-4), those patients who did not receive RRA (who tended to have pT3 N0 disease) had five-year recurrence-free survival of >90%.

Off-label use of cetuximab plus sorafenib and panitumumab plus regorafenib to personalize therapy for a patient with V600E BRAF-mutant metastatic colon cancer.,Cancer biology & therapy,Cancer Biol. Ther.,2013-06-13,"Sorafenib, the first agent developed to target BRAF mutant melanoma, is a multi-kinase inhibitor that was approved by the FDA for therapy of kidney and subsequently liver cancer, and is currently in clinical trials for thyroid, lung and brain cancer. Colorectal cancer with V600E BRAF mutation has shown relative resistance to standard chemotherapy regimens, as well as lack of efficacy to vemurafenib in clinical trials. New treatments are needed for BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. We report a case of a patient with BRAF-mutant metastatic colon cancer whose disease had progressed on FOLFOX plus bevacizumab and subsequent FOLFIRI plus cetuximab. Based on preclinical data published in Nature in 2012 suggesting that successful therapeutic targeting of BRAF in colorectal cancer may require concomitant targeting of the EGFR, we offered this patient without other attractive options the combination of sorafenib plus cetuximab, in off-label use with informed consent. Sorafenib and cetuximab therapy led to a mixed radiographic response with some areas showing dramatic improvement and other areas showing stable disease over a 7-month period which is a notably long period of progression-free survival for V600E BRAF mutated colon cancer. The cetuximab plus sorafenib therapy was very well-tolerated by the patient who remained on it long enough until another therapy option, regorafenib, was approved in September 2012.

Effects of vascular endothelial growth factor signaling inhibition on human erythropoiesis.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2013-07-30,"Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling increases red blood cell (RBC) counts, and erythropoiesis markers have been proposed to guide antiangiogenic therapy in humans. We analyzed RBC measurements in patients enrolled in three studies: a phase II trial of axitinib in thyroid cancer; a study of sorafenib in advanced solid tumors; and a randomized trial of fluorouracil, hydroxyurea, and radiation with and without bevacizumab for head and neck cancer. In the sorafenib trial, plasma erythropoietin concentrations were measured at baseline, day 8, and day 35. Over the first 84 days of treatment, RBC counts increased for each day on sorafenib (2.7 M/μL [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.5-3.9]) and axitinib (4.3 M/μL [95% CI, 2.2-6.5]). RBCs declined over the first 68 days of cytotoxic chemoradiotherapy alone (-12.8 M/μL per day [95% CI, -15.7 to -9.8]) but less so with added bevacizumab (-7.2 M/μL per day [95% CI, -9.5 to -4.9]). Erythropoietin levels increased, on average, by 9.5 mIU/mL between day 8 and day 35 of sorafenib exposure. No significant relationships between elevations in RBCs and changes in volume status or blood pressure or between elevations in erythropoietin and smoking status were found.

Does BRAF V600E mutation predict aggressive features in papillary thyroid cancer? Results from four endocrine surgery centers.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2013-08-22,"Existing evidence is controversial regarding the association between BRAF mutation status and aggressive features of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Specifically, no study has incorporated multiple surgical practices performing routine central lymph node dissection (CLND) and thus has patients who are truly evaluable for the presence or absence of central lymph node metastases (CLNMs). Consecutive patients who underwent total thyroidectomy and routine CLND at 4 tertiary endocrine surgery centers were retrospectively reviewed. Descriptive and bivariable analyses examined demographic, patient, and tumor-related factors. Multivariable analyses examined the odds of CLNM associated with positive BRAF status. In patients with classical variant PTC, bivariate analysis found no significant associations between BRAF mutation and aggressive clinicopathologic features; multivariate analysis demonstrated that BRAF status was not an independent predictor of CLNM. When all patients with PTC were analyzed, including those with aggressive or follicular subtypes, bivariate analysis showed BRAF mutation to be associated with LNM, advanced American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, and histologic subtype. Multivariable analyses showed BRAF, age, size, and extrathyroidal extension to be associated with CLNM. Although BRAF mutation was found to be an independent predictor of central LNM in the overall cohort of patients with PTC, this relationship lost significance when only classical variant PTC was included in the analysis. The usefulness of BRAF in predicting the presence of LNM remains questionable.

We conducted a double-blind, phase III trial comparing cabozantinib with placebo in 330 patients with documented radiographic progression of metastatic MTC. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to cabozantinib (140 mg per day) or placebo. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Additional outcome measures included tumor response rate, overall survival, and safety. The estimated median PFS was 11.2 months for cabozantinib versus 4.0 months for placebo (hazard ratio, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.40; P < .001). Prolonged PFS with cabozantinib was observed across all subgroups including by age, prior TKI treatment, and RET mutation status (hereditary or sporadic). Response rate was 28% for cabozantinib and 0% for placebo; responses were seen regardless of RET mutation status. Kaplan-Meier estimates of patients alive and progression-free at 1 year are 47.3% for cabozantinib and 7.2% for placebo. Common cabozantinib-associated adverse events included diarrhea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, decreased weight and appetite, nausea, and fatigue and resulted in dose reductions in 79% and holds in 65% of patients. Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 16% of cabozantinib-treated patients and in 8% of placebo-treated patients. Cabozantinib (140 mg per day) achieved a statistically significant improvement of PFS in patients with progressive metastatic MTC and represents an important new treatment option for patients with this rare disease. This dose of cabozantinib was associated with significant but manageable toxicity.","Clinical Trial, Phase III",2331.0,502.0,Cabozantinib a tyrosine kinase inhibitor TKI of growth factor receptor MET vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and rearranged during transfection RET demonstrated clinical activity in patients with medullary cancer MTC in phase I We conducted a double-blind phase III trial comparing cabozantinib with placebo in 330 patients with documented radiographic progression of metastatic MTC Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to cabozantinib 140 mg per day or placebo The primary end point was progression-free survival PFS Additional outcome measures included tumor response rate overall survival and safety The estimated median PFS was 11.2 months for cabozantinib versus 4.0 months for placebo hazard ratio 0.28 95 CI 0.19 to 0.40 P .001 Prolonged PFS with cabozantinib was observed across all subgroups including by age prior TKI treatment and RET mutation status hereditary or sporadic Response rate was 28 for cabozantinib and 0 for placebo responses were seen regardless of RET mutation status Kaplan-Meier estimates of patients alive and progression-free at 1 year are 47.3 for cabozantinib and 7.2 for placebo Common cabozantinib-associated adverse events included diarrhea palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia decreased weight and appetite nausea and fatigue and resulted in dose reductions in 79 and holds in 65 of patients Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 16 of cabozantinib-treated patients and in 8 of placebo-treated patients Cabozantinib 140 mg per day achieved a statistically significant improvement of PFS in patients with progressive metastatic MTC and represents an important new treatment option for patients with this rare disease This dose of cabozantinib was associated with significant but manageable toxicity,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[3048, 8, 564, 216, 230, 1379, 1, 129, 161, 153, 543, 756, 845, 129, 161, 153, 18, 2, 3201, 190, 3789, 2412, 264, 38, 128, 4, 7, 5, 4564, 12, 3959, 4, 124, 70, 21, 426, 8, 1627, 3142, 124, 316, 160, 1430, 3048, 5, 619, 4, 7105, 7, 5, 1405, 1580, 91, 1, 113, 3959, 7, 11, 1108, 896, 18, 14, 6, 3048, 3304, 81, 379, 218, 15, 619, 3, 86, 396, 741, 10, 91, 115, 25, 300, 402, 228, 1018, 159, 30, 51, 116, 63, 25, 2, 367, 3, 661, 52, 300, 10, 175, 18, 53, 9, 3048, 185, 39, 13, 53, 9, 619, 360, 197, 13, 339, 48, 58, 13, 326, 6, 13, 327, 19, 144, 1069, 300, 5, 3048, 10, 164, 716, 62, 1453, 141, 20, 89, 324, 1379, 24, 2, 2412, 258, 156, 2305, 15, 1928, 51, 116, 10, 339, 9, 3048, 2, 13, 9, 619, 253, 11, 527, 1583, 1, 2412, 258, 156, 876, 882, 1423, 1, 7, 1701, 2, 91, 115, 28, 14, 111, 32, 662, 27, 9, 3048, 2, 67, 18, 9, 619, 186, 3048, 41, 290, 281, 159, 1172, 9768, 9769, 10694, 340, 924, 2, 4062, 1218, 2, 613, 2, 627, 4, 61, 2153, 4, 842, 2, 5253, 4, 556, 1, 7, 290, 281, 836, 6, 24, 2007, 4, 245, 1, 3048, 73, 7, 2, 4, 66, 1, 619, 73, 7, 3048, 3304, 81, 379, 218, 513, 8, 712, 93, 767, 1, 300, 4, 7, 5, 1014, 113, 3959, 2, 1449, 35, 305, 217, 24, 1501, 9, 7, 5, 26, 622, 34, 26, 61, 1, 3048, 10, 41, 5, 93, 84, 2808, 155]",1755.0,24002501,400

This report presents our experience with preoperative embolization of hypervascular thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spinal column tumors in the largest series to date. We conducted a retrospective review of 228 angiograms and 188 pre-operative embolizations for tumors involving thoracic, lumbar and sacral spinal column. Tumor vascularity was evaluated with conventional spinal angiography and was graded from 0 (same as normal adjacent vertebral body) to 3 (severe tumor blush with arteriovenous shunting). Embolic materials included poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) particles and detachable platinum coils and rarely, liquid embolics. The degree of embolization was graded as complete, near-complete, or partial. Anesthesia records were reviewed to document blood loss during surgery. Renal cell carcinoma (44.2%), thyroid carcinoma (9.2%), and leiomyosarcoma (6.6%) were the most common tumors out of a total of 40 tumor histologies. Hemangiopericytoma had the highest mean vascularity (2.6) of all tumor types with at least five representative cases followed by renal cell carcinoma (2.0) and thyroid carcinoma (2.0). PVA particles were used in 100% of cases. Detachable platinum coils were used in 51.6% of cases. Complete, near-complete, and partial embolizations were achieved in 86.1%, 12.7%, and 1.2% of all cases, respectively. There were no new post-procedure neurologic deficits or other complications with long-term morbidity. The mean intra-operative blood loss for the hypervascular tumors treated with pre-operative embolization was 1745 cc. Preoperative embolization of hypervascular thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spine tumors can be performed with high success rates and a high degree of safety at high volume centers.

Clinical efficacy of targeted biologic agents as second-line therapy of advanced thyroid cancer.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2013-10-23,"Targeted biologic agents showed clinically meaningful efficacy as front-line therapy for advanced radioiodine-refractory and medullary thyroid cancer. The clinical benefit of these agents beyond the front line has yet to be established. We assessed the clinical benefit of targeted agents in patients with advanced differentiated and medullary thyroid cancer treated at a single academic cancer center. We determined efficacy and compared front-line and second-line benefit using biochemical and anatomic response, time to treatment failure, and progression-free survival (PFS). Statistical differences were assessed by t test and chi-square test. Survival curves were generated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences in survival were assessed using the log-rank test, and a p value <.05 was considered significant. We identified 39 patients with advanced differentiated and medullary thyroid cancer treated with targeted biologic agents. Median age was 56.3 years. Overall, 25 men and 14 women participated. Histology showed 23% medullary and 77% differentiated cancer. Nineteen patients progressed on front-line therapy and subsequently received second-line therapy. Targeted agents conferred clinically meaningful benefit in the second-line setting in terms of biochemical response (13.3%), clinical benefit (83.3%), median time to treatment failure (4.0 months; 95% confidence interval: 2.6-8.2), and median PFS (4.6 months; 95% confidence interval: 3.2-8.2).

Utility of a histone deacetylase inhibitor (PXD101) for thyroid cancer treatment.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2013-10-14,"We evaluated the therapeutic effects of the histone deacetylase inhibitor PXD101 alone and in combination with conventional chemotherapy in treating thyroid cancer. We studied eight cell lines from four types of thyroid cancer (papillary, follicular, anaplastic and medullary). The cytotoxicity of PXD101 alone and in combination with three conventional chemotherapeutic agents (doxorubicin, paclitaxel and docetaxel) was measured using LDH assay. Western blot assessed expression of acetylation of histone H3, histone H4 and tubulin, proteins associated with apoptosis, RAS/RAF/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways, DNA damage and repair. Apoptosis and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by flow cytometry. Mice bearing flank anaplastic thyroid cancers (ATC) were daily treated with intraperitoneal injection of PXD101 for 5 days per week. PXD101 effectively inhibited thyroid cancer cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. PXD101 induced ROS accumulation and inhibited RAS/RAF/ERK and PI3K/mTOR pathways in sensitive cells. Double-stranded DNA damage and apoptosis were induced by PXD101 in both sensitive and resistant cell lines. PXD101 retarded growth of 8505C ATC xenograft tumors with promising safety.

Paired diagnostic and pharmacodynamic analysis of rare non-small cell lung cancer cells enabled by the VerIFAST platform.,Lab on a chip,Lab Chip,2014-01-01,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States and worldwide. This has led to major research initiatives focusing on improving early diagnosis rate, as well as the development of pharmacodynamic biomarkers. However, broad clinical integration of these approaches is limited due to the invasive nature of lung biopsies, needle aspirates and resections. Recently, an advance for sampling suspicious lung nodules to collect mini-bronchoalveolar lavage (mBAL) samples was shown to be diagnostically relevant but limited by standard cytology techniques leading to low sensitivity and specificity. In addition, a second non-invasive method that holds great promise is the collection of circulating tumor cells, a rare population of tumor cells that have shed into peripheral circulation from primary or metastatic tumor sites, from blood. Here, we utilize a recently published platform, VerIFAST, for the capture and proteomic analysis of rare cells, to isolate cells of interest from lung cancer patients using both mBAL and blood samples. The VerIFAST platform leverages surface tension at the microscale to pin aqueous and oil fluids in adjacent chambers to create a virtual filter between two aqueous fluids. In this manuscript, the VerIFAST was further enhanced to include oil pinning, which allowed on-device tumbling, further eliminating a laborious and time consuming step that could result in increased sample loss. Finally, we further developed the base assays used in standard histopathologic assays for diagnostic and pharmacodynamic analysis of these rare lung cancer cells. Specifically, we examined thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) signal intensity, in which loss is associated with more aggressive disease, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signal intensity, which is a high value therapeutic target in lung cancer.

We report our experience of an observational approach to the cN0 neck in PTC. We reviewed 1,129 patients with PTC who had total thyroidectomy between 1986 and 2005. In that group, 470 patients were pN1; 384 had benign nodes removed (pN0); and the remaining 275 had no nodes removed (pNx). The pNx group formed the cohort for this study. With a median follow-up of 70 months, the 10-yr disease-specific survival was 100%. We found 4 patients who had evidence of radioactive iodine uptake on scans performed during follow-up without diagnostic cytology. All subsequently received radioactive iodine and are considered disease free. Three patients had biopsy-proven lateral-neck recurrence and underwent neck dissection; 1 patient developed a low-level thyroglobulin suspicious for recurrence; and 1 patient had a subcentimeter level VI node suspicious for recurrence, which has been observed. Therefore, the rate of structural recurrence in the central neck was 0.4% (1/275), and the rate of reoperation on the central neck was 0.

The relationship between chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and central neck lymph node metastasis in North American patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma.,Surgery,Surgery,2013-12-01,"Several studies have reported that concurrent chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (CLT) with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is associated with improved prognosis of the PTC, including decreased lymph node metastasis. We sought to assess the incidence of central nodal metastasis (CNM) in patients with PTC and concurrent CLT. We studied 495 consecutive patients who underwent thyroidectomy with nodal excision for PTC. Pathology reports identified the presence of CLT and the extent of CNM. There were 226 patients (46%) with CLT and 220 (44%) with CNM. Patients with CLT were more often female (88% vs. 71%; P < .001) and had a younger median age (43 vs. 47 years; P = .03), a lesser incidence of CNM (35% vs. 52.4%; P < .001), and a greater incidence of pT1a (40% vs. 25%; P < .001) and pT1b (38% vs. 29%; P < .001) tumors. Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of CLT was associated with a 39% decreased odds of CNM after adjusting for age, gender, tumor size, PTC histopathologic subtype, and presence of lymphovascular invasion (odds ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.99; P = .046).

Telomere content and risk of second malignant neoplasm in survivors of childhood cancer: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2013-11-25,"Shorter constitutional telomere length has been associated with increased cancer incidence. Furthermore, telomere shortening is observed in response to intensive chemotherapy and/or ionizing radiation exposure. We aimed to determine whether less telomere content was associated with treatment-related second malignant neoplasms (SMN) in childhood cancer survivors. Using a nested case-control design, 147 cancer survivors with breast cancer, thyroid cancer, or sarcoma developing after treatment for childhood cancer (cases) were matched (1:1) with childhood cancer survivors without a SMN (controls). Cases and controls were matched by primary cancer diagnosis, years since diagnosis, age at the time of sample collection, years of follow-up from childhood cancer diagnosis, exposure to specific chemotherapy agents, and to specific radiation fields. We performed conditional logistic regression using telomere content as a continuous variable to estimate ORs with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for development of SMN. ORs were also estimated for specific SMN types, i.e., breast cancer, thyroid cancer, and sarcoma. There was an inverse relationship between telomere content and SMN, with an adjusted OR of 0.3 per unit change in telomere length to single-copy gene ratio (95% CI, 0.09-1.02; P = 0.05). Patients with thyroid cancer SMN were less likely to have more telomere content (OR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.00-0.55; P = 0.01), but statistically significant associations could not be demonstrated for breast cancer or sarcoma.

Median CSI and total boost doses were 30.6 and 54 Gy. Forty patients received chemotherapy, varying by histology. Median follow-up was 20.1 months (range, 0.3-59). Median doses to the thyroid gland, pituitary gland, hypothalamus, and cochleae were 0.003 Gy-relative biological effectiveness (RBE; range, 0.001-8.5), 36.1 Gy-RBE (22.5-53.0), 37.1 Gy-RBE (22.3-54.4), and 33.9 Gy-RBE (22.2-52.4), respectively. Median percent weight loss during CSI was 1.6% (range, 10% weight loss to 14% weight gain). Mild nausea/vomiting was common (grade 1 = 46%, grade 2 = 20%); however, only 5 patients experienced grade ≥2 anorexia (weight loss >5% baseline weight). Median percent baseline white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets at nadir were 52% (range, 13%-100%), 97% (65%-112%), and 61% (10%-270%), respectively. Four patients developed grade ≥3 cytopenias. Overall and progression-free survival rates were 96% and 82%, respectively, at 2 years and 84% and 68% at 5 years.

Malignancy rate in thyroid nodules classified as Bethesda category III (AUS/FLUS).,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2014-03-10,"The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology is the standard for interpreting fine needle aspiration (FNA) specimens. The ""atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance"" (AUS/FLUS) category, known as Bethesda Category III, has been ascribed a malignancy risk of 5-15%, but the probability of malignancy in AUS/FLUS specimens remains unclear. Our objective was to determine the risk of malignancy in thyroid FNAs categorized as AUS/FLUS at a comprehensive cancer center. The management of 541 AUS/FLUS thyroid nodule patients treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between 2008 and 2011 was analyzed. Clinical and radiologic features were examined as predictors for surgery. Target AUS/FLUS nodules were correlated with surgical pathology. Of patients with an FNA initially categorized as AUS/FLUS, 64.7% (350/541) underwent immediate surgery, 17.7% (96/541) had repeat FNA, and 17.6% (95/541) were observed. Repeat FNA cytology was unsatisfactory in 5.2% (5/96), benign in 42.7% (41/96), AUS/FLUS in 38.5% (37/96), suspicious for follicular neoplasm in 5.2% (5/96), suspicious for malignancy in 4.2% (4/96), and malignant in 4.2% (4/96). Of nodules with two consecutive AUS/FLUS diagnoses that were resected, 26.3% (5/19) were malignant. Among all index AUS/FLUS nodules (triaged to surgery, repeat FNA, or observation), malignancy was confirmed on surgical pathology in 26.6% [CI 22.4-31.3]. Among AUS/FLUS nodules triaged to surgery, the malignancy rate was 37.8% [CI 33.1-42.8]. Incidental cancers were found in 22.3% of patients. On univariate logistic regression analysis, factors associated with triage to surgery were younger patient age (p<0.0001), increasing nodule size (p<0.0001), and nodule hypervascularity (p=0.032). In patients presenting to a comprehensive cancer center, malignancy rates in nodules with AUS/FLUS cytology are higher than previously estimated, with 26.6-37.8% of AUS/FLUS nodules harboring cancer.

Cancer recurrence: an important but missing variable in national cancer registries.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2014-02-07,"Cancer recurrence is a critically important outcome to patients and providers. However, no publicly available cancer registry data contain recurrence information. The National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) collects recurrence data; however, this information is not provided to researchers because of completeness and accuracy concerns. Our objective was to examine completeness of cancer recurrence information in the NCDB. Stage I-III thyroid/colon/melanoma/pancreas/breast cancers diagnosed in 2002-2005 were identified. Recurrence status, recurrence type, and recurrence date were evaluated for data completeness. Patient, tumor, and hospital factors were examined using generalized linear mixed models. Pseudo-R (2) statistics estimated the relative contribution of patient and hospital factors. Of 702,144 patients with thyroid/colon/melanoma/pancreas/breast cancers treated in 1405 hospitals, recurrence information was incomplete in 21.5/24.0/20.2/34.8/18.2 % of patients, respectively. On average, hospitals had incomplete recurrence information on 56.7-66.7 % of their patients. Patients with incomplete information had more comorbidities, a higher cancer stage, non-private insurance, and lived farther from the hospital. Hospitals with the poorest collection were larger tertiary hospitals serving higher-income patients. However, these patients and hospital factors explained less than 3 %, while unexplained hospital variation accounted for the largest part of the observed variation (%ΔR (2) = 84 %). The majority of hospitals report incomplete recurrence information for more than half of their patients.

The impact of molecular testing on the surgical management of patients with thyroid nodules.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg.

However, the true impact of these tests on surgical practice has not been demonstrated. This study examines the usefulness of molecular testing on surgical management decisions in patients referred for thyroid surgery at a tertiary care center. Clinical information was collected from patients who presented to Johns Hopkins Hospital for surgical consultation regarding a thyroid nodule and who underwent molecular testing between August 2009 and March 2013. Tests included an RNA-based gene expression classifier, a DNA-based somatic mutation panel, BRAF, NRAS, and/or RET/PTC translocation. A surgical management algorithm was created by consensus of four thyroid surgeons. Postsurgical pathology analysis in each case was then used to judge the appropriateness of the surgical decision-making and the usefulness of preoperative molecular testing, in guiding surgical planning. Of 114 patients assessed by preoperative molecular testing, 87 (72 %) underwent surgery. Surgical management was altered in nine (10 %) patients on the basis of molecular testing. Of these, surgical management change was appropriate, relative to the postoperative pathology analysis, for three patients and inappropriate for six patients. In this study, molecular testing of thyroid nodule did not alter the surgical management of the majority of patients with thyroid nodules.

Detection of circulating tumor DNA in early- and late-stage human malignancies.,Science translational medicine,Sci Transl Med,2014-02-01,"The development of noninvasive methods to detect and monitor tumors continues to be a major challenge in oncology. We used digital polymerase chain reaction-based technologies to evaluate the ability of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to detect tumors in 640 patients with various cancer types. We found that ctDNA was detectable in >75% of patients with advanced pancreatic, ovarian, colorectal, bladder, gastroesophageal, breast, melanoma, hepatocellular, and head and neck cancers, but in less than 50% of primary brain, renal, prostate, or thyroid cancers. In patients with localized tumors, ctDNA was detected in 73, 57, 48, and 50% of patients with colorectal cancer, gastroesophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and breast adenocarcinoma, respectively. ctDNA was often present in patients without detectable circulating tumor cells, suggesting that these two biomarkers are distinct entities. In a separate panel of 206 patients with metastatic colorectal cancers, we showed that the sensitivity of ctDNA for detection of clinically relevant KRAS gene mutations was 87.2% and its specificity was 99.2%. Finally, we assessed whether ctDNA could provide clues into the mechanisms underlying resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor blockade in 24 patients who objectively responded to therapy but subsequently relapsed. Twenty-three (96%) of these patients developed one or more mutations in genes involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.

Metastasis of primary lung carcinoma to the breast: a systematic review of the literature.,The Journal of surgical research,J. Surg. Res.,2014-01-24,"The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize previously published case reports of primary lung carcinoma metastasis to the breast to assess common clinical and pathologic features and management strategies. Case reports describing breast metastasis of primary lung carcinoma were systematically evaluated in MEDLINE and EMBASE. Thirty-one reported cases of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) metastasized to the breast were identified, along with eight cases of small-cell lung carcinoma. Sixty-seven percent of reported NSCLC metastases to the breast were detected metachronously with the primary lung abnormality, whereas 80% of small-cell lung carcinoma breast metastases appeared synchronously. Thyroid transcription factor 1 was found to be expressed in 58% of total NSCLC breast metastases, including 83% of those of adenocarcinoma origin. Therapeutic strategies among NSCLC cases varied widely, and only 36% of NSCLC breast metastasis patients were administered chemotherapy. Additional sites of metastasis in these cases are summarized as well. It is recommended to include metastatic lung cancer in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with a breast abnormality in the context of a suspected lung cancer. Thyroid transcription factor 1 expression should be examined in these cases. The metachronous versus synchronous nature of lung carcinoma metastasis to the breast has consequences for both detection of the primary and secondary lesions and patient outlook.

Sorafenib in metastatic thyroid cancer: a systematic review.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2014-02-21,"Sorafenib was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for radioiodine-resistant metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). In addition, two drugs (vandetanib and cabozantinib) have received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for use in medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Several published phase II trials have investigated the efficacy of sorafenib in thyroid cancers, but to date, results from those studies have not been compared. A systematic review of the literature was performed to assess response rate, median progression-free survival, and adverse events associated with sorafenib therapy for metastatic thyroid cancers. This review included seven trials involving 219 patients: 159 with DTC (papillary, follicular, and poorly differentiated), 52 with MTC, and 8 with anaplastic thyroid cancer. No study reported complete responses to treatment. Overall partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease rates were 21%, 60%, and 20%, respectively. The median progression-free survival was 18 months for patients with all subtypes of thyroid cancer. Drug was discontinued in 16% of patients because of toxicities or intolerance, and the dose was reduced in a further 56%. Side effects with an incidence ≥ 50% were hand-foot syndrome (74%), diarrhea (70%), skin rash (67%), fatigue (61%), and weight loss (57%). Deaths not related to progressive disease occurred in nearly 4% of patients. Treatment with sorafenib in patients with progressive DTC and MTC is a promising strategy, but the adverse event rate is high, leading to a high rate of dose reduction or discontinuation.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition enhances response to oncolytic herpesviral therapy through nectin-1.,Human gene therapy,Hum. Gene Ther.,2014-04-02,"Cancers exhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are associated with aggressive behavior and increased metastatic potential. Therapies that are able to target EMT would have significant clinical value. Nectin-1 is a cell surface herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) receptor that also forms a component of intercellular adherens junctions, which are typically disrupted in EMT. To explore relationships between HSV-1 sensitivity and EMT, we generated cell lines with a stable EMT phenotype from human follicular thyroid cancer (WRO82-1) through E-cadherin silencing with short hairpin RNA (shEcadWRO). HSV-1 viral attachment and gene expression were both enhanced in shEcadWRO as compared with shControl. Immunoblotting and immunostaining revealed enhanced nectin-1 expression by shEcadWRO. Receptor-blocking assays demonstrated that increased herpesviral entry into shEcadWRO as compared with shControl was mediated predominantly through nectin-1. Colocalization of green fluorescent protein-tagged HSV-1 and tdTomato-tagged nectin-1 confirmed an increase in viral attachment to nectin-1 in shEcadWRO. Cell viability assays demonstrated increased susceptibility of shEcadWRO to HSV-1 oncolysis, and a murine flank tumor model showed significantly enhanced regression of shEcadWRO tumors in response to oncolytic HSV-1 as compared with control tumors. A separate model of EMT induction through transforming growth factor-β stimulation confirmed enhanced HSV-1 susceptibility in Panc1 cells. These results demonstrate that the process of EMT leads to increased herpesviral susceptibility through enhanced cell surface nectin-1 expression, suggesting that cancers exhibiting EMT may be naturally sensitive targets for herpesviral therapy.",Journal Article,2120.0,7.0,Cancers exhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition EMT are associated with aggressive behavior and increased metastatic potential Therapies that are able to target EMT would have significant clinical value Nectin-1 is a cell surface herpes simplex virus type 1 HSV-1 receptor that also forms a component of intercellular adherens junctions which are typically disrupted in EMT To explore relationships between HSV-1 sensitivity and EMT we generated cell lines with a stable EMT phenotype from human follicular cancer WRO82-1 through E-cadherin silencing with short hairpin RNA shEcadWRO HSV-1 viral attachment and gene expression were both enhanced in shEcadWRO as compared with shControl Immunoblotting and immunostaining revealed enhanced nectin-1 expression by shEcadWRO Receptor-blocking assays demonstrated that increased herpesviral entry into shEcadWRO as compared with shControl was mediated predominantly through nectin-1 Colocalization of green fluorescent protein-tagged HSV-1 and tdTomato-tagged nectin-1 confirmed an increase in viral attachment to nectin-1 in shEcadWRO Cell viability assays demonstrated increased susceptibility of shEcadWRO to HSV-1 oncolysis and a murine flank tumor model showed significantly enhanced regression of shEcadWRO tumors in response to oncolytic HSV-1 as compared with control tumors A separate model of EMT induction through transforming growth factor-β stimulation confirmed enhanced HSV-1 susceptibility in Panc1 cells These results demonstrate that the process of EMT leads to increased herpesviral susceptibility through enhanced cell surface nectin-1 expression suggesting that cancers exhibiting EMT may be naturally sensitive targets for herpesviral therapy,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[163, 4801, 701, 1569, 1970, 2208, 32, 41, 5, 571, 1710, 2, 101, 113, 174, 235, 17, 32, 1665, 6, 283, 2208, 688, 47, 93, 38, 549, 10758, 14, 16, 8, 31, 1255, 4716, 7241, 1450, 267, 14, 4702, 14, 153, 17, 120, 2377, 8, 1249, 1, 10417, 23560, 10262, 92, 32, 1969, 5576, 4, 2208, 6, 1645, 2467, 59, 4702, 14, 485, 2, 2208, 21, 1419, 31, 285, 5, 8, 585, 2208, 1005, 29, 171, 1974, 12, 37769, 14, 298, 563, 2154, 2077, 5, 978, 5957, 893, 27347, 4702, 14, 1667, 9364, 2, 145, 55, 11, 110, 651, 4, 27347, 22, 72, 5, 39138, 5293, 2, 5027, 553, 651, 10758, 14, 55, 20, 27347, 153, 2521, 1013, 264, 17, 101, 40625, 3001, 237, 27347, 22, 72, 5, 39138, 10, 517, 2117, 298, 10758, 14, 15872, 1, 4658, 2910, 178, 9874, 4702, 14, 2, 27284, 9874, 10758, 14, 557, 35, 344, 4, 1667, 9364, 6, 10758, 14, 4, 27347, 31, 2120, 1013, 264, 101, 1432, 1, 27347, 6, 4702, 14, 9739, 2, 8, 1471, 5564, 30, 202, 224, 97, 651, 320, 1, 27347, 57, 4, 51, 6, 3236, 4702, 14, 22, 72, 5, 182, 57, 8, 2282, 202, 1, 2208, 504, 298, 3621, 129, 161, 1458, 2503, 557, 651, 4702, 14, 1432, 4, 23603, 37, 46, 99, 608, 17, 3, 1129, 1, 2208, 1940, 6, 101, 40625, 1432, 298, 651, 31, 1255, 10758, 14, 55, 802, 17, 163, 4801, 2208, 68, 40, 6045, 745, 637, 9, 40625, 36]",1714.0,24568312,226

It is being evaluated in phase II and III clinical trials, which include treatment as a single agent (locally advanced/metastatic radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer [DTC]), as part of multimodality care (HCC), and in combination with chemotherapeutic agents (metastatic breast cancer). Sorafenib-related adverse events (AEs) that commonly occur across these tumor types include hand-foot skin reaction (HSFR), rash, upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) distress (ie, diarrhea), fatigue, and hypertension. These commonly range from grade 1 to 3, per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), and often occur early in treatment. The goal for the management of these AEs is to prevent, treat, and/or minimize their effects, thereby enabling patients to remain on treatment and improve their quality of life. Proactive management, along with ongoing patient education (before and during sorafenib treatment), can help to effectively manage symptoms, often without the need for sorafenib dose modification or drug holidays.

"Association between hypogonadism, symptom burden, and survival in male patients with advanced cancer.",Cancer,Cancer,2014-02-27,"A high frequency of hypogonadism has been reported in male patients with advanced cancer. The current study was performed to evaluate the association between low testosterone levels, symptom burden, and survival in male patients with cancer. Of 131 consecutive male patients with cancer, 119 (91%) had an endocrine evaluation of total (TT), free (FT), and bioavailable testosterone (BT); high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP); vitamin B12; thyroid-stimulating hormone; 25-hydroxy vitamin D; and cortisol levels when presenting with symptoms of fatigue and/or anorexia-cachexia. Symptoms were evaluated by the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale. The authors examined the correlation using the Spearman test and survival with the log-rank test and Cox regression analysis. The median age of the patients was 64 years; the majority of patients were white (85 patients; 71%). The median TT level was 209 ng/dL (normal: ≥ 200 ng/dL), the median FT was 4.4 ng/dL (normal: ≥ 9 ng/dL), and the median BT was 22.0 ng/dL (normal: ≥ 61 ng/dL). Low TT, FT, and BT values were all associated with worse fatigue (P ≤ .04), poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (P ≤ .05), weight loss (P ≤ .01), and opioid use (P ≤ .005). Low TT and FT were associated with increased anxiety (P ≤ .04), a decreased feeling of well-being (P ≤ .04), and increased dyspnea (P ≤ .05), whereas low BT was only found to be associated with anorexia (P = .05). Decreased TT, FT, and BT values were all found to be significantly associated with elevated CRP and low albumin and hemoglobin. On multivariate analysis, decreased survival was associated with low TT (hazards ratio [HR], 1.66; P = .034), declining Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (HR, 1.55; P = .004), high CRP (HR, 3.28; P < .001), and decreased albumin (HR, 2.52; P < .001). In male patients with cancer, low testosterone levels were associated with systemic inflammation, weight loss, increased symptom burden, and decreased survival.

Toxicol. Pathol.,2014-02-28,"There is a growing need for modeling the human thyroid to link data obtained from animals to humans because of its sensitivity to radiation exposure and endocrine disruption chemicals. In a scid mouse model produced by transplanting human thyroid tissues, leakiness and thymic lymphoma that occurs spontaneously in the scid mouse can complicate the interpretation of experimental results. Considering that the NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid)Il2rg(tm1Sug)/Jic mouse (NOD/Shi-scid, IL-2Rγ(null) or NOG mouse) may be a better host because this strain has low incidence of leakiness and thymic lymphoma, we have evaluated the potential of a model that allows long-term observation of non-tumor human thyroid tissues in this mouse. We transplanted tissues of human adenomatous goiter into NOG mice and examined the tissues histopathologically. The morphology of human adenomatous goiter tissues was maintained from 24 to 44 weeks after transplantation in NOG mice with no noted differences between donor-matched tissues or the weeks after transplantation. The tissues expressed thyroglobulin protein and mRNA as well as thyroperoxidase. Endothelial cells originating from human were found in the transplanted tissues and were thought to be a characteristic of this model. The intactness of the tissues before transplantation was found to affect the rate of tissue engraftment. From the present results we have concluded that transplanted thyroid tissues in NOG mice maintain the histopathological characteristics of their origin for long terms. Therefore this model was thought feasible for toxicity evaluation.

We previously reported a tumor response rate of 49% in patients with advanced differentiated thyroid cancer and 0% in patients with advanced anaplastic thyroid cancer. The present report details results of pazopanib therapy in advanced medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). OBJECTIVE, DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS, INTERVENTION, AND OUTCOME MEASURES: Having noted preclinical activity of pazopanib in MTC, patients with advanced MTC who had disease progression within the preceding 6 months were accrued to this multiinstitutional phase II clinical trial to assess tumor response rate (by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria) and safety of pazopanib given orally once daily at 800 mg until disease progression or intolerability. From September 22, 2008, to December 11, 2011, 35 individuals (80% males, median age 60 y) were enrolled. All patients have been followed up until treatment discontinuation or for a minimum of four cycles. Eight patients (23%) are still on the study treatment. The median number of therapy cycles was eight. Five patients attained partial Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors responses (14.3%; 90% confidence interval 5.8%-27.7%), with a median progression-free survival and overall survival of 9.4 and 19.9 months, respectively. Side effects included treatment-requiring (new) hypertension (33%), fatigue (14%), diarrhea (9%), and abnormal liver tests (6%); 3 of 35 patients (8.6%) discontinued therapy due to adverse events.

Prevalence by age and predictors of medullary thyroid cancer in patients with lower risk germline RET proto-oncogene mutations.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2014-06-06,"Age-related risk of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) development in presymptomatic carriers of lower risk germline RET mutations is uncertain; such data may aid counseling patients regarding timing of thyroidectomy. From an institutional database and an exhaustive literature review, we identified 679 patients with American Thyroid Association (ATA) level A or B mutations who were identified because of family screening (index cases of MTC were excluded to minimize selection bias). We evaluated age at thyroidectomy or last evaluation if no thyroidectomy, preoperative calcitonin level (elevated or not), the mutated codon, and outcome (MTC vs. no MTC after thyroidectomy or no clinical evidence of MTC if thyroid intact). Data were used to estimate the cumulative prevalence of MTC and/or assess likelihood of MTC stratified by codon. After exclusion of cases with missing data or small representation, 503 patients with mutations in codons 533, 609, 611, 618, 620, 791, and 804 were analyzed. 236 patients had MTC. Cumulative prevalence and median time to MTC varied by codon and within ATA risk levels (p<0.0001). Patients with a codon 620 mutation were 2.8-6.9 times more likely to have MTC than other level B mutation carriers, and 5.1-21.7 times more likely than level A mutation carriers included in our focus population. The youngest median time to MTC was 19 years for codon 620 and the oldest was 56 years for codon 611. Cumulative prevalence of MTC by age 20 was 10% or lower for codons 533, 609, 611, 791, and 804. By age 50, it ranged from 18% for codon 791 to 95% for codon 620. An elevated preoperative calcitonin level strongly predicted MTC on final pathology, though false-negative rates varied by codon (p<0.0001). Positive predictive values ranged from 76% to 100% by codon with an overall positive predictive value of 87% across codons. This study offers a better understanding of the age-related development of MTC in lower risk RET mutation carriers, provides evidence of further distinctions between lower risk mutations within ATA subgroups, and clarifies the clinical significance of codon 791 mutations.

Role of salvage targeted therapy in differentiated thyroid cancer patients who failed first-line sorafenib.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2014-03-14,"Sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is a common first-line therapy for advanced differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). However, responses are not durable and drug toxicity remains a problem. The objective of the study was to determine the efficacy of salvage therapy after first-line sorafenib failure. This was a retrospective review at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from January 2005 to May 2013. The study included patients with metastatic DTC who received salvage therapy after their initial sorafenib failure (group 2). PATIENTS who received first-line sorafenib only (group 1) were evaluated for comparison of overall survival (OS). Progression-free survival, best response, and median OS were measured. Sixty-four patients with metastatic, radioactive iodine refractory DTC were included; 35 were in group 1 and 25 were in group 2, and the groups were well balanced. Median OS of all 64 patients receiving first line sorafenib was 37 months; median OS was significantly longer with salvage therapy compared with sorafenib alone (58 vs 28 months, P = .013). In group 2, 17 patients were evaluable for best response, although two patients had toxicity with sorafenib, which was discontinued before restaging. Best responses with first-line sorafenib were partial response in 2 of 15 (13%), stable disease in 10 of 15 (67%), and progressive disease in 3 of 15 (20%) patients. With salvage therapy, partial responses were seen in 7 of 17 (41%) and stable disease in 10 of 17 (59%) patients. Median progression-free survival was 7.4 months with first-line sorafenib and 11.4 months with salvage therapy. Salvage therapy included sunitinib (n = 4), pazopanib (n = 3), cabozantinib (n = 4), lenvatinib (n = 3), and vemurafenib (n = 3). Other targeted agents are effective salvage treatments after sorafenib failure, despite similar mechanisms of action, and should be offered to patients who are able to receive salvage therapy.",Journal Article,2139.0,59.0,Sorafenib a tyrosine kinase inhibitor is a common first-line therapy for advanced differentiated cancer DTC However responses are not durable and drug toxicity remains a problem The objective of the study was to determine the efficacy of salvage therapy after first-line sorafenib failure This was a retrospective review at M.

Secondary malignant neoplasms after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue for high-risk neuroblastoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2014-03-14,"Outcomes for high-risk neuroblastoma remain poor. Modern treatment protocols utilizing intense induction followed by myeloablative consolidation chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue (ASCR) have improved survival rates, but the long-term sequelae, including development of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMN), are just now surfacing. We retrospectively reviewed data from 87 patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who were treated with intensive induction chemotherapy followed by ASCR between January 1991 and July 2011 following one of two institutional protocols: Chicago Pilot 1 (CP1; n = 12) and Chicago Pilot 2 (CP2; n = 75). The 15-year overall survival rate for all 87 patients was 33.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23.1-45.0%). The 10- and 15-year cumulative incidence of SMN was 16.5% (95%CI, 7.2-38.0%) and 34.2% (95%CI, 18.6-63.1%), respectively, without evidence of a plateau at 15 years. Six of the 10 patients (n = 2 in CP1 and n = 8 in CP2) who developed SMN had hematologic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Solid tumors included thyroid papillary carcinoma, chondrosarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and biliary adenocarcinoma. A significantly higher incidence of SMN, especially hematological malignancies, was observed in this cohort compared to older neuroblastoma studies, potentially due to exposure to epipodophyllotoxins and a high cumulative dose of alkylating agents these patients received. The risk of developing an SMN continued to increase with survival time and did not reach the plateau at 15 years. Although the number of the patients is relatively small, our study emphasizes the need for life-long follow-up of survivors who were treated using modern therapy.",Clinical Trial,2139.0,15.0,Outcomes for high-risk remain poor Modern treatment protocols utilizing intense induction followed by myeloablative consolidation chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue ASCR have improved survival rates but the long-term sequelae including development of secondary malignant neoplasms SMN are just now surfacing We retrospectively reviewed data from 87 patients with high-risk who were treated with intensive induction chemotherapy followed by ASCR between January 1991 and July 2011 following one of two institutional protocols Chicago Pilot 1 CP1 n 12 and Chicago Pilot 2 CP2 n 75 The 15-year overall survival rate for all 87 patients was 33.9 95 confidence interval CI 23.1-45.0 The 10- and 15-year cumulative incidence of SMN was 16.5 95 CI 7.2-38.0 and 34.2 95 CI 18.6-63.1 respectively without evidence of a plateau at 15 years Six of the 10 patients n 2 in CP1 and n 8 in CP2 who developed SMN had hematologic malignancies including acute myeloid AML /myelodysplastic syndrome MDS Solid tumors included papillary carcinoma chondrosarcoma carcinoma and biliary adenocarcinoma A significantly higher incidence of SMN especially hematological malignancies was observed in this cohort compared to older studies potentially due to exposure to epipodophyllotoxins and a high cumulative dose of alkylating agents these patients received The risk of developing an SMN continued to increase with survival time and did not reach the plateau at 15 years Although the number of the patients is relatively small our study emphasizes the need for life-long follow-up of survivors who were treated using modern therapy,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[123, 9, 64, 43, 918, 334, 2366, 24, 2189, 2600, 3933, 504, 370, 20, 3246, 2173, 56, 5, 1028, 452, 31, 4256, 10729, 47, 231, 25, 151, 84, 3, 319, 337, 4156, 141, 193, 1, 568, 393, 1179, 6474, 32, 4673, 1134, 64078, 21, 894, 446, 74, 29, 912, 7, 5, 64, 43, 54, 11, 73, 5, 1686, 504, 56, 370, 20, 10729, 59, 1024, 3372, 2, 2066, 1132, 366, 104, 1, 100, 1115, 2189, 9344, 2281, 14, 22525, 78, 133, 2, 9344, 2281, 18, 48258, 78, 481, 3, 167, 111, 63, 25, 116, 9, 62, 912, 7, 10, 466, 83, 48, 307, 268, 58, 382, 14, 512, 13, 3, 79, 2, 167, 111, 967, 287, 1, 6474, 10, 245, 33, 48, 58, 67, 18, 519, 13, 2, 562, 18, 48, 58, 203, 49, 676, 14, 106, 187, 241, 1, 8, 6133, 28, 167, 60, 437, 1, 3, 79, 7, 78, 18, 4, 22525, 2, 78, 66, 4, 48258, 54, 276, 6474, 42, 813, 441, 141, 286, 533, 329, 10589, 681, 1223, 537, 57, 159, 1796, 134, 6116, 134, 2, 2532, 449, 8, 97, 142, 287, 1, 6474, 1093, 2890, 441, 10, 164, 4, 26, 180, 72, 6, 434, 94, 751, 520, 6, 645, 6, 25999, 2, 8, 64, 967, 61, 1, 3410, 183, 46, 7, 103, 3, 43, 1, 931, 35, 6474, 1351, 6, 344, 5, 25, 98, 2, 205, 44, 3690, 3, 6133, 28, 167, 60, 242, 3, 207, 1, 3, 7, 16, 1352, 302, 114, 45, 7519, 3, 594, 9, 358, 319, 166, 126, 1, 332, 54, 11, 73, 75, 2366, 36]",1617.0,24634399,576
Aerodigestive fistula formation as a rare side effect of antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy for thyroid cancer.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2014-03-17,"In the past decade, targeted therapy with antiangiogenic drugs has become standard of care for most types of metastatic, progressive thyroid cancer. While these drugs were thought initially to be less toxic than traditional chemotherapy, they can have rare but serious and fatal toxicities. Once such toxicity that has been reported in other tumor types is upper airway fistula formation, which can be life-threatening. Here, we describe three patients treated with antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors at two academic institutions who developed aerodigestive fistula. All three patients had risk factors for fistula formation, which included external beam radiation and/or large tumor with invasion of the tracheal wall. Fistula formation is a known but rare side effect of antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Knowledge of the risk factors that may predispose thyroid cancer patients to this serious adverse event is vital prior to prescribing antiangiogenics. Particular caution should be observed when using these drugs in patients undergoing radiation therapy or surgery, or in patients whose tumor is invading vital structures of the neck, as they may be at higher risk of developing this rare complication.

Measuring the extent of total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma using radioactive iodine imaging: relationship with serum thyroglobulin and clinical outcomes.,JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,2014-05-01,"IMPORTANCE Despite performing total thyroidectomy (TT), postoperative radioactive iodine (RAI) imaging often demonstrates the presence of residual thyroid tissue within the operative bed. OBJECTIVE To measure the extent of TT using postoperative RAI imaging and assessing serum thyroglobulin (Tg) level for patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We evaluated 245 patients undergoing TT for clinically staged cT1-3N0M0 DTC, who underwent diagnostic postoperative RAI imaging. INTERVENTIONS Total thyroidectomy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES On the basis of quantitative measurements, RAI uptake (RAIU) in the thyroid bed of 0.2% of administered activity was selected as the cutpoint to determine the presence or absence of thyroid remnant. RESULTS By postoperative RAI imaging, TT in 106 patients (43%) resulted in RAIU of less than 0.2%. In the remaining 139 patients (57%), there was measurable iodine-avid thyroid tissue and/or tumor in the thyroid bed (n = 117 [84%]), the neck (n = 4 [3%]), or both (n = 18 [13%]). For the entire study population, mean 24-hour RAIU was 0.62%. Stimulated serum Tg levels were obtained in 232 of 245 patients (95%). Measurable stimulated Tg level (≥1 ng/mL) (to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1) was found in 26 of 102 patients (25%) without thyroid remnant and in 87of 133 patients (65%) with thyroid remnant (P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A goal of postthyroidectomy RAIU of less than 0.2% helps maximize the likelihood of an unmeasurable postoperative Tg level, potentially simplifying follow-up evaluation and reducing the use of postoperative RAI in order to facilitate surveillance.

Germline alterations in RASAL1 in Cowden syndrome patients presenting with follicular thyroid cancer and in individuals with apparently sporadic epithelial thyroid cancer.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2014-04-08,"RASAL1 has recently been identified as an important tumor suppressor for sporadic thyroid tumorigenesis, particularly for follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) and anaplastic thyroid cancer. Thyroid cancer is an important component of Cowden syndrome (CS). Patients with germline PTEN mutations have an overrepresentation of FTC over other histological subtypes. To determine the prevalence of germline RASAL1 mutations in PTEN mutation-positive and wild type CS patients. We reviewed our prospective database of more than 3000 CS/CS-like patients and retrospectively identified a subset of patients who presented with thyroid cancer for RASAL1 mutation analysis. We reviewed data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) sporadic papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) database with germline data for RASAL1 mutations to determine the prevalence of germline RASAL1 mutations in CS-related thyroid cancer patients. We scanned 155 CS/CS-like patients with thyroid cancer for germline RASAL1 mutations. Of the 155 patients, 39 had known germline pathogenic PTEN mutations (PTEN(mut+)) and 116 were PTEN mutation negative (PTEN(WT)). Among these 155 patients, we identified RASAL1 germline alterations suspected as being deleterious in two patients. Both were patients with PTEN(WT) who had FTC (2/48, 4.1%). This was in contrast to patients with PTEN(mut+) who had thyroid cancer (0/39). Of 339 sporadic patients with PTC from the TCGA study, 62 (18%) had germline RASAL1 variants predicted to be deleterious. TCGA patients with follicular-variant PTC were statistically overrepresented (21/62, 34%) among patients with deleterious RASAL1 variants compared with those without (57/277, 21%).

Normalization of lymphocyte count after high ablative dose of I-131 in a patient with chronic lymphoid leukemia and secondary papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Case report.,"Einstein (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",Einstein (Sao Paulo),,"The authors report the case of a 70-year-old male patient with chronic lymphoid leukemia who presented subsequently a papillary carcinoma of the thyroid with metastases to regional lymph nodes. The patient was treated with surgical thyroidectomy with regional and cervical lymph node excision and radioiodine therapy (I-131). The protocolar control scintigraphy 4 days after the radioactive dose showed I-131 uptake in both axillae and even in the inguinal regions. PET/CT showed faint FDG-F-18 uptake in one lymph node of the left axilla. An ultrasound guided fine needle biopsy of this lymph node identified by I-131 SPECT/CT and FDG-F-18 PET/CT revealed lymphoma cells and was negative for thyroid tissue and thyroglobulin content. The sequential blood counts done routinely after radiation treatment showed a marked fall until return to normal values of leucocytes and lymphocytes (absolute and relative), which were still normal in the last control 19 months after the radioiodine administration. Chest computed tomography showed a decrease in size of axillary and para-aortic lymph nodes. By immunohistochemistry, cells of the lymphoid B lineage decreased from 52% before radioiodine therapy to 5% after the procedure. The authors speculate about a possible sodium iodide symporter expression by the cells of this lymphoma, similar to some other non-thyroid tumors, such as breast cancer cells.

Efficacy and tolerability of different starting doses of sorafenib in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2014-04-14,"Sorafenib has proven efficacy in advanced differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), but many patients must reduce the dose or discontinue treatment because of toxicity. The tolerability and efficacy of lower starting doses of sorafenib for DTC remain largely unstudied. Methods. We retrospectively examined overall survival, time to treatment failure, time to progression, discontinuation rates, and dose-reduction and interruption rates in patients with metastatic DTC treated with first-line sorafenib outside of a clinical trial. Two patient groups were compared; group 1 received the standard starting dose of 800 mg/day, and group 2 received any dose lower than 800 mg/day. Results. We included 75 adult patients, with 51 in group 1 and 24 in group 2. Mean age at diagnosis was 54 years, and 56% were male. The most common histologies included 43% papillary thyroid cancer of the conventional type, 15% papillary thyroid cancer of the follicular variant, and 15% Hürthle cell carcinoma. Time to treatment failure was 10 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.6-14.3) in group 1 and 8 months (95% CI: 3.4-12.5) in group 2 (p = .56). Median overall survival was 56 months (95% CI: 30.6-81.3) in group 1 and 30 months (95% CI: 16.1-43.8) in group 2 (p = .08). Rates of discontinuation due to disease progression were 79% in group 1 and 91% in group 2, and 21% in group 1 and 9% in group 2 (p = .304) stopped treatment because of toxicity. Dose-reduction rates were 59% and 43% (p = .29), and interruption rates were 65% and 67% (p = .908) in group 1 and group 2, respectively. Conclusion. Efficacy and tolerability of sorafenib in treatment-naïve DTC patients does not appear to be negatively influenced by lower starting daily doses.

Outcomes of adrenal-sparing surgery or total adrenalectomy in phaeochromocytoma associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2: an international retrospective population-based study.,The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2014-04-15,"The prevention of medullary thyroid cancer in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 syndrome has demonstrated the ability of molecular diagnosis and prophylactic surgery to improve patient outcomes. However, the other major neoplasia associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, phaeochromocytoma, is not as well characterised in terms of occurrence and treatment outcomes. In this study, we aimed to systematically characterise the outcomes of management of phaeochromocytoma associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. This multinational observational retrospective population-based study compiled data on patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 from 30 academic medical centres across Europe, the Americas, and Asia. Patients were included if they were carriers of germline pathogenic mutations of the RET gene, or were first-degree relatives with histologically proven medullary thyroid cancer and phaeochromocytoma. We gathered clinical information about patients'RET genotype, type of treatment for phaeochromocytoma (ie, unilateral or bilateral operations as adrenalectomy or adrenal-sparing surgery, and as open or endoscopic operations), and postoperative outcomes (adrenal function, malignancy, and death). The type of surgery was decided by each investigator and the timing of surgery was patient driven. The primary aim of our analysis was to compare disease-free survival after either adrenal-sparing surgery or adrenalectomy. 1210 patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 were included in our database, 563 of whom had phaeochromocytoma. Treatment was adrenalectomy in 438 (79%) of 552 operated patients, and adrenal-sparing surgery in 114 (21%). Phaeochromocytoma recurrence occurred in four (3%) of 153 of the operated glands after adrenal-sparing surgery after 6-13 years, compared with 11 (2%) of 717 glands operated by adrenalectomy (p=0.57). Postoperative adrenal insufficiency or steroid dependency developed in 292 (86%) of 339 patients with bilateral phaeochromocytoma who underwent surgery. However, 47 (57%) of 82 patients with bilateral phaeochromocytoma who underwent adrenal-sparing surgery did not become steroid dependent. The treatment of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2-related phaeochromocytoma continues to rely on adrenalectomies with their associated Addisonian-like complications and consequent lifelong dependency on steroids. Adrenal-sparing surgery, a highly successful treatment option in experienced centres, should be the surgical approach of choice to reduce these complications.",Journal Article,2107.0,58.0,The prevention of medullary cancer in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 syndrome has demonstrated the ability of molecular diagnosis and prophylactic surgery to improve patient outcomes However the other major neoplasia associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 phaeochromocytoma is not as well characterised in terms of occurrence and treatment outcomes In this study we aimed to systematically characterise the outcomes of management of phaeochromocytoma associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 This multinational observational retrospective population-based study compiled data on patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 from 30 academic medical centres across Europe the Americas and Asia Patients were included if they were carriers of germline pathogenic mutations of the RET gene or were first-degree relatives with histologically proven medullary cancer and phaeochromocytoma We gathered clinical information about patients'RET genotype type of treatment for phaeochromocytoma ie unilateral or bilateral operations as adrenalectomy or adrenal-sparing surgery and as open or endoscopic operations and postoperative outcomes adrenal function malignancy and death The type of surgery was decided by each investigator and the timing of surgery was patient driven The primary aim of our analysis was to compare disease-free survival after either adrenal-sparing surgery or adrenalectomy 1210 patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 were included in our database 563 of whom had phaeochromocytoma Treatment was adrenalectomy in 438 79 of 552 operated patients and adrenal-sparing surgery in 114 21 Phaeochromocytoma recurrence occurred in four 3 of 153 of the operated glands after adrenal-sparing surgery after 6-13 years compared with 11 2 of 717 glands operated by adrenalectomy p=0.57 Postoperative adrenal insufficiency or steroid dependency developed in 292 86 of 339 patients with bilateral phaeochromocytoma who underwent surgery However 47 57 of 82 patients with bilateral phaeochromocytoma who underwent adrenal-sparing surgery did not become steroid dependent The treatment of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2-related phaeochromocytoma continues to rely on adrenalectomies with their associated Addisonian-like complications and consequent lifelong dependency on steroids Adrenal-sparing surgery a highly successful treatment option in experienced centres should be the surgical approach of choice to reduce these complications,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[3, 1070, 1, 4564, 12, 4, 7, 5, 232, 1293, 2298, 267, 18, 681, 71, 264, 3, 801, 1, 219, 147, 2, 1862, 152, 6, 401, 69, 123, 137, 3, 127, 458, 2298, 41, 5, 232, 1293, 2298, 267, 18, 16678, 16, 44, 22, 149, 10715, 4, 1794, 1, 2291, 2, 24, 123, 4, 26, 45, 21, 1295, 6, 3390, 16885, 3, 123, 1, 284, 1, 16678, 41, 5, 232, 1293, 2298, 267, 18, 26, 8243, 2495, 459, 266, 90, 45, 8535, 74, 23, 7, 5, 232, 1293, 2298, 267, 18, 29, 201, 1916, 484, 4496, 716, 3934, 3, 31128, 2, 5958, 7, 11, 159, 492, 491, 11, 1316, 1, 1009, 2806, 138, 1, 3, 2412, 145, 15, 11, 157, 1444, 3335, 5, 2161, 1930, 4564, 12, 2, 16678, 21, 7546, 38, 487, 545, 64227, 1183, 267, 1, 24, 9, 16678, 2523, 3208, 15, 1607, 3867, 22, 6647, 15, 2987, 1851, 152, 2, 22, 1020, 15, 2056, 3867, 2, 573, 123, 2987, 343, 710, 2, 273, 3, 267, 1, 152, 10, 10561, 20, 296, 3464, 2, 3, 1972, 1, 152, 10, 69, 1621, 3, 86, 1130, 1, 114, 65, 10, 6, 932, 34, 115, 25, 50, 361, 2987, 1851, 152, 15, 6647, 32156, 7, 5, 232, 1293, 2298, 267, 18, 11, 159, 4, 114, 609, 13140, 1, 953, 42, 16678, 24, 10, 6647, 4, 11003, 842, 1, 10097, 7297, 7, 2, 2987, 1851, 152, 4, 3803, 239, 16678, 146, 489, 4, 294, 27, 1, 4251, 1, 3, 7297, 3966, 50, 2987, 1851, 152, 50, 49, 233, 60, 72, 5, 175, 18, 1, 14430, 3966, 7297, 20, 6647, 19, 13, 696, 573, 2987, 4360, 15, 3853, 6359, 276, 4, 8155, 868, 1, 7881, 7, 5, 1607, 16678, 54, 208, 152, 137, 662, 696, 1, 878, 7, 5, 1607, 16678, 54, 208, 2987, 1851, 152, 205, 44, 1417, 3853, 470, 3, 24, 1, 232, 1293, 2298, 267, 18, 139, 16678, 2274, 6, 5533, 23, 27363, 5, 136, 41, 40694, 733, 521, 2, 8436, 9590, 6359, 23, 4580, 2987, 1851, 152, 8, 561, 1401, 24, 1501, 4, 592, 4496, 257, 40, 3, 221, 353, 1, 1866, 6, 969, 46, 521]",2501.0,24745698,10
"Sorafenib in radioactive iodine-refractory, locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer: a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial.","Lancet (London, England)",Lancet,2014-04-24,"Patients with radioactive iodine ((131)I)-refractory locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer have a poor prognosis because of the absence of effective treatment options. In this study, we assessed the efficacy and safety of orally administered sorafenib in the treatment of patients with this type of cancer. In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (DECISION), we investigated sorafenib (400 mg orally twice daily) in patients with radioactive iodine-refractory locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer that had progressed within the past 14 months. Adult patients (≥18 years of age) with this type of cancer were enrolled from 77 centres in 18 countries. To be eligible for inclusion, participants had to have at least one measurable lesion by CT or MRI according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST); Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2; adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function; and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration lower than 0·5 mIU/L. An interactive voice response system was used to randomly allocate participants in a 1:1 ratio to either sorafenib or matching placebo. Patients, investigators, and the study sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, assessed every 8 weeks by central independent review. Analysis was by intention to treat. Patients in the placebo group could cross over to open-label sorafenib upon disease progression. Archival tumour tissue was examined for BRAF and RAS mutations, and serum thyroglobulin was measured at baseline and at each visit. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00984282, and with the EU Clinical Trials Register, number EudraCT 2009-012007-25. Patients were randomly allocated on a 1:1 basis to sorafenib or placebo. The intention-to-treat population comprised 417 patients (207 in the sorafenib group and 210 in the placebo group) and the safety population was 416 patients (207 in the sorafenib group and 209 in the placebo group). Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the sorafenib group (10·8 months) than in the placebo group (5·8 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0·59, 95% CI 0·45-0·76; p<0·0001). Progression-free survival improved in all prespecified clinical and genetic biomarker subgroups, irrespective of mutation status. Adverse events occurred in 204 of 207 (98·6%) patients receiving sorafenib during the double-blind period and in 183 of 209 (87·6%) patients receiving placebo. Most adverse events were grade 1 or 2. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events in the sorafenib group were hand-foot skin reaction (76·3%), diarrhoea (68·6%), alopecia (67·1%), and rash or desquamation (50·2%). Sorafenib significantly improved progression-free survival compared with placebo in patients with progressive radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. Adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of sorafenib. These results suggest that sorafenib is a new treatment option for patients with progressive radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer.

Second malignant neoplasms in patients with Cowden syndrome with underlying germline PTEN mutations.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2014-04-28,"Patients with Cowden syndrome (CS) with underlying germline PTEN mutations are at increased risk of breast, thyroid, endometrial, and renal cancers. To our knowledge, risk of subsequent cancers in these patients has not been previously explored or quantified. We conducted a 7-year multicenter prospective study (2005 to 2012) of patients with CS or CS-like disease, all of whom underwent comprehensive PTEN mutational analysis. Second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) were ascertained by medical records and confirmed by pathology reports. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for all SMNs combined and for breast, thyroid, endometrial, and renal cancers were calculated. Of the 2,912 adult patients included in our analysis, 2,024 had an invasive cancer history. Germline pathogenic PTEN mutations (PTEN mutation positive) were identified in 114 patients (5.6%). Of these 114 patients, 46 (40%) had an SMN. Median age of SMN diagnosis was 50 years (range, 21 to 71 years). Median interval between primary cancer and SMN was 5 years (range, <1 to 35 years). Of the 51 PTEN mutation-positive patients who presented with primary breast cancer, 11 (22%) had a subsequent new primary breast cancer and 10-year second breast cancer cumulative risk of 29% (95% CI, 15.3 to 43.7). Risk of SMNs compared with that of the general population was significantly elevated for all cancers (SIR, 7.74; 95% CI, 5.84 to 10.07), specifically for breast (SIR, 8.92; 95% CI, 5.85 to 13.07), thyroid (SIR, 5.83; 95% CI, 3.01 to 10.18), and endometrial SMNs (SIR, 14.08.07; 95% CI, 7.10 to 27.21).

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® thyroid carcinoma.,Oral oncology,Oral Oncol.,2014-06-01,"The ACR Head and Neck Cancer Appropriateness Criteria Committee reviewed relevant medical literature to provide guidance for those managing patients with thyroid carcinoma. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteriaare evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances where evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment. Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy in the United States, most often presenting as a localized palpable nodule. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for WDTC, with most patients undergoing complete resection of their disease having good outcomes. Following surgery thyroxine supplementation should begin to suppress TSH, which unchecked can stimulate residual disease and/or metastatic progression, Adjuvant treatment with radioactive iodine (RAI) using iodine-131 ((131)I) is frequently used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The use of EBRT for thyroid cancer has not been tested in well-designed, randomized, controlled trials and should, therefore, be considered on a case-by-case basis. Chemotherapy plays a minimal role in the management of WDTC.

Considering the paucity of information about thyroid autoimmunity in patients receiving cancer vaccines, we designed our study to assess the development of thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs) in patients treated with GVAX (vaccine made of a tumor cell type transfected with GM-CSF) and/or ipilimumab and correlated seroconversion with survival. Using both in house and commercial ELISA assays, we measured TgAbs in patients with pancreatic (No. = 53), prostate (No. = 35) or colon (No. = 8) cancer, before and after treatment with GVAX only (No. = 34), GVAX plus ipilimumab (No. = 42) or ipilimumab (No. = 20), and correlated their levels with patient's survival, disease status and T-cell surface markers. Antibodies to thyroperoxidase, myeloperoxidase, proteinase 3, insulin and actin were also measured. TgAbs specifically developed after GVAX, independent of the underlying cancer (81% in prostate, 75% colon cancer and 76% pancreatic cancer) and co-administration of ipilimumab (75% in GVAX only and 78% in GVAX plus ipilimumab). This TgAbs seroconversion could be detected mainly by the in house assay, suggesting that the thyroglobulin epitopes recognized by the antibodies induced by GVAX are different from the epitopes seen in the classic form of Hashimoto thyroiditis. Notably, TgAbs seroconversion was associated with significantly prolonged survival (p = 0.01 for pancreas and p = 0.005 for prostate cancer).

The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, a cohort of more than 14,000 childhood cancer survivors with detailed exposure data and long-term follow-up, has substantially contributed to our understanding of the roles of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in second cancer occurrence. In particular, dose-related risks have been demonstrated for second cancers of the breast, thyroid, central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and sarcomas following radiation. Cytotoxic chemotherapy-which has long been known to be leukemogenic-also appears to contribute to risk for a range of other second cancer types. Individuals who develop a second cancer are at particularly high risk for developing additional second cancers. A genome-wide association study of survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma who received radiotherapy identified a locus on chromosome 6q21 as being associated with second cancer risk, demonstrating that recent advances in genomics are likely to prove invaluable for elucidating the contribution of genetic susceptibility to second cancer etiology. Among adults, risk of second cancers varies substantially by type of first and second cancer, patient age, and prevalence of second cancer risk factors, including primary cancer treatments, environmental and lifestyle exposures, and genetic susceptibility.

A clinical algorithm for fine-needle aspiration molecular testing effectively guides the appropriate extent of initial thyroidectomy.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2014-07-01,"To test whether a clinical algorithm using routine cytological molecular testing (MT) promotes initial total thyroidectomy (TT) for clinically significant thyroid cancer (sTC) and/or correctly limits surgery to lobectomy when appropriate. Either TT or lobectomy is often needed to diagnose differentiated thyroid cancer. Determining the correct extent of initial thyroidectomy is challenging. After implementing an algorithm for prospective MT of in-house fine-needle aspiration biopsy specimens, we conducted a single-institution cohort study of all patients (N = 671) with nonmalignant cytology who had thyroidectomy between October 2010 and March 2012, cytological diagnosis using 2008 Bethesda criteria, and 1 or more indications for thyroidectomy by 2009 American Thyroid Association guidelines. sTC was defined by histological differentiated thyroid cancer of 1 cm or more and/or lymph node metastasis. Cohort 2 patients did not have MT or had unevaluable results. In cohort 1, MT for a multigene mutation panel was performed for nonbenign cytology, and positive MT results indicated initial TT. MT guidance was associated with a higher incidence of sTC after TT (P = 0.006) and a lower rate of sTC after lobectomy (P = 0.03).

Overview and management of dermatologic events associated with targeted therapies for medullary thyroid cancer.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2014-07-15,"Treatment options for patients with advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) have, in recent years, expanded with the approval of two tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs): vandetanib and cabozantinib. Other agents, including TKIs, are under clinical investigation for MTC. Although patients treated with TKIs are at risk of developing dermatologic adverse events (AE), these untoward events may be mitigated through AE-driven algorithms. AE-driven algorithms combine effective nonpharmaceutical and pharmaceutical treatment modalities implemented by a multidisciplinary effort that incorporates nursing interventions, patient education, and referrals to pain-management specialists, podiatrists, and dermatologists, as appropriate. Effective AE prevention and management reduce the need for dose interruptions and modifications, allowing patients the opportunity to derive the maximal benefit from TKI therapy, while maintaining quality of life.

Cribriform-morular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma: an indication to screen for occult FAP.,Familial cancer,Fam. Cancer,2014-12-01,"Cribriform-morular variant (CMV) is a rare subtype of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) that is associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Given the high likelihood for multi-organ malignancies in FAP patients, this study explores the yield of diagnosing occult FAP among CMV-PTC patients. Institutional database was searched in order to identify patients with pathologically-confirmed CMV-PTC from 2000 to 2012. Medical records were reviewed, and clinical and pathological features were analyzed. Eleven cases of CMV were identified from 6,901 patients with PTC, for a prevalence of 0.16 %. All 11 patients were female. The median age at CMV-PTC diagnosis was 36 years (range 18-46). Two patients had pre-existing FAP at the time of PTC diagnosis. The other nine patients were referred for colonoscopy and/or genetic testing. Six patients underwent colonoscopy and one (17 %) was diagnosed with FAP based on polyposis phenotype and genetic testing. The mean age of patients at the time of CMV-PTC diagnosis was younger in the FAP group (23 years, range 18-34) than in the sporadic group (37 years, range 25-46). All three patients with FAP-associated CMV-PTC had multicentric tumors, while all five sporadic patients did not. Our study found that approximately one-sixth of patients with CMV-PTC may have occult FAP. Patients with FAP-associated CMV-PTC appear to be younger and more likely to have multicentric tumors than those with sporadic CMV-PTC.

Patients with a diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis, attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis, and gene mutation-negative adenomatous polyposis enrolled in our Hereditary Colorectal Cancer Family Registry were eligible for a screening thyroid ultrasound (US). Findings were reviewed by the study endocrinologist and intervention and/or follow-up determined. Fifty patients underwent screening thyroid US. Thirty-four (68%) patients had abnormal findings on US, including 27 (79%) with thyroid nodules. In 7 patients, US-detected thyroid nodules met established criteria for fine-needle aspiration. Of the 6 patients who underwent fine-needle aspiration, 2 (4%) were diagnosed with papillary TC. Both of these patients were female.

Involved-nodal radiation therapy leads to lower doses to critical organs-at-risk compared to involved-field radiation therapy.,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,Radiother Oncol,2014-07-28,"Involved field radiotherapy (IFRT) after cytotoxic chemotherapy has become the standard of care in treating pediatric patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. However, recent interest in shrinking the treatment volume to involved node radiotherapy (INRT) may allow lower doses to critical organ structures. We dosimetrically compared IFRT and INRT treatment approaches. INRT treatment plans were retrospectively constructed from 17 consecutively treated pediatric patients identified with Hodgkin lymphoma who had been previously treated with conventional IFRT. The radiation doses delivered to organs-at-risk (OARs) with virtual INRT treatment plans based on INRT field design were then compared to the original IFRT treatment plans. Metrics for comparison included mean doses to organs and volumes of organ receiving at least 50% of the original prescription dose (V50%). A one-tailed, paired t-test was then performed to verify statistical significance at an alpha level of 0.05. All organs at risk compared in this investigation (kidneys, heart, thyroid, parotids, and lungs) had significantly lower doses of radiation with INRT when compared to IFRT (p<0.05).

"A phase I study of imatinib, dacarbazine, and capecitabine in advanced endocrine cancers.",BMC cancer,BMC Cancer,2014-08-02,"Patients with advanced endocrine cancers, such as adrenocortical carcinoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma, have few well-validated therapeutic options. Pre-clinical studies have suggested potential activity of imatinib in these tumors. We therefore sought to establish a safe, novel treatment regimen combining imatinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy for future study in endocrine cancers. A standard 3 + 3 dose-escalation design was used with a 21-day cycle, including imatinib on days 1-21, dacarbazine on days 1-3, and capecitabine on days 1-14. Twenty patients were treated. The most frequent toxicities were edema and fatigue, with dose-limiting fatigue and dyspnea. The recommended phase II regimen is dacarbazine 250 mg/m2 daily on day 1-3, capecitabine 500 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1-14, and imatinib 300 mg daily on days 1-21 of a 21-day cycle. Interestingly, responses were seen in patients with adrenocortical carcinoma, with 1 of 6 patients experiencing a partial response and a second experiencing a minor response, with progression-free survival of 8.8 and 6.4 months, respectively. The regimen of imatinib, dacarbazine, and capecitabine is well-tolerated. It may have some activity in adrenocortical carcinoma, and further study of this combination or its components may be beneficial for this disease with limited treatment options.

Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is a tumor type that may be sensitive to cabozantinib. Therefore, we evaluated cabozantinib in a cohort of heavily pretreated patients with metastatic DTC. This single-arm open-label phase I trial assessed the safety, tolerability, and antitumor activity of cabozantinib in DTC patients taking part in a drug-drug interaction study. Adult patients with histologically confirmed metastatic or surgically unresectable DTC (including papillary, follicular, or Hürthle cell) were enrolled. Patients received daily oral dosing of 140 mg cabozantinib. Safety was assessed by evaluation of adverse events (AEs), vital signs, electrocardiograms, laboratory tests, and concomitant medications. Tumor response by magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scan was investigator assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.0. The study enrolled 15 patients who had failed standard radioactive iodine therapy. Patients had received a median of two prior systemic agents, and 11 patients (73%) had previously received at least one VEGF pathway inhibiting therapy. Common AEs included diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, and decreased appetite. Partial response was reported in eight patients (53%). Median progression-free survival and median overall survival were not reached. Cabozantinib demonstrates a safety profile similar to other multitargeted VEGFR inhibitors in advanced DTC patients.

Cowden syndrome-associated germline SDHD variants alter PTEN nuclear translocation through SRC-induced PTEN oxidation.,Human molecular genetics,Hum. Mol. Genet.,2014-08-22,"Germline mutations in the PTEN tumor-suppressor gene and germline variations in succinate dehydrogenase subunit D gene (SDHD-G12S, SDHD-H50R) are associated with a subset of Cowden syndrome and Cowden syndrome-like individuals (CS/CSL) and confer high risk of breast, thyroid and other cancers. However, very little is known about the underlying crosstalk between SDHD and PTEN in CS-associated thyroid cancer. Here, we show SDHD-G12S and SDHD-H50R lead to impaired PTEN function through alteration of its subcellular localization accompanied by resistance to apoptosis and induction of migration in both papillary and follicular thyroid carcinoma cell lines. Other studies have shown elevated proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (SRC) activity in invasive thyroid cancer cells; so, we explore bosutinib, a specific inhibitor for SRC, to explore SRC as a mediator of SDH-PTEN crosstalk in this context. We show that SRC inhibition could rescue SDHD dysfunction-induced cellular phenotype and tumorigenesis only when wild-type PTEN is expressed, in thyroid cancer lines. Patient lymphoblast cells carrying either SDHD-G12S or SDHD-H50R also show increased nuclear PTEN and more oxidized PTEN after hydrogen peroxide treatment. Like in thyroid cells, bosutinib decreases oxidative PTEN in patient lymphoblast cells carrying SDHD variants, but not in patients carrying both SDHD variants and PTEN truncating mutations. In summary, our data suggest a novel mechanism whereby SDHD germline variants SDHD-G12S or SDHD-H50R induce thyroid tumorigenesis mediated by PTEN accumulation in the nucleus and may shed light on potential treatment with SRC inhibitors like bosutinib in PTEN-wild-type SDHD-variant/mutation positive CS/CSL patients and sporadic thyroid neoplasias.

Coupling of prostate and thyroid cancer diagnoses in the United States.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2014-09-10,"Prostate and thyroid cancers represent two of the most overdiagnosed tumors in the US. Hypothesizing that patients diagnosed with one of these malignancies were more likely to be diagnosed with the other, we examined the coupling of diagnoses of prostate and thyroid cancer in a large US administrative dataset. The surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) database was used to identify men diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer (CaP) or thyroid cancer between 1995 and 2010. SEER*stat software was used to estimate multivariable-adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and investigate the rates of subsequent malignancy diagnosis. Additional non-urologic cancer sites were added as control groups. Patients with thyroid cancer were much more likely to be diagnosed with CaP than patients in the SEER control group (SIR 1.28 [95% CI 1.1-1.5]; p < 0.05). Similarly, the observed incidence of thyroid cancer was significantly higher in patients with CaP when compared with SEER controls (SIR 1.30 [95% CI 1.2-1.4]; p < 0.05). When stratified by follow-up interval, the observed thyroid cancer diagnosis rate among men with CaP was significantly higher than expected at 2-11 (SIR 1.83 [95% CI 1.4-2.4]), 12-59 (SIR 1.24 [95% CI 1.0-1.5]), and 60-119 (SIR 1.25 [95% CI 1.0-1.5]) months of follow-up. There was no increased risk of CaP or thyroid cancer diagnosis among patients with non-urologic malignancies.

Retrospective analysis of 18F-FDG PET/CT for staging asymptomatic breast cancer patients younger than 40 years.,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",J. Nucl. Med.,2014-09-11,"National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines consider (18)F-FDG PET/CT for only clinical stage III breast cancer patients. However, there is debate whether TNM staging should be the only factor in considering if PET/CT is warranted. Patient age may be an additional consideration, because young breast cancer patients often have more aggressive tumors with potential for earlier metastases. This study assessed PET/CT for staging of asymptomatic breast cancer patients younger than 40 y. In this Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective study, our hospital information system was screened for breast cancer patients younger than 40 y who underwent staging PET/CT before any treatment. Patients with symptoms or conventional imaging findings suggestive of distant metastases or with prior malignancy were excluded. Initial stage was based on physical examination, mammography, ultrasound, and breast MR imaging. PET/CT was then evaluated to identify unsuspected extraaxillary regional nodal and distant metastases. One hundred thirty-four patients with initial breast cancer stage I to IIIC met inclusion criteria. PET/CT findings led to upstaging to stage III or IV in 28 patients (21%). Unsuspected extraaxillary regional nodes were found in 15 of 134 patients (11%) and distant metastases in 20 of 134 (15%), with 7 of 134 (5%) demonstrating both. PET/CT revealed stage IV disease in 1 of 20 (5%) patients with initial clinical stage I, 2 of 44 (5%) stage IIA, 8 of 47 (17%) stage IIB, 4 of 13 (31%) stage IIIA, 4 of 8 (50%) stage IIIB, and 1 of 2 (50%) stage IIIC. All 20 patients upstaged to stage IV were histologically confirmed. Four synchronous thyroid and 1 rectal malignancies were identified. PET/CT revealed distant metastases in 17% of asymptomatic stage IIB breast cancer patients younger than 40 y. Although guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend against systemic staging in patients with stage II disease, our data suggest that PET/CT might be valuable in younger patients with stage IIB and III disease. Use of PET/CT in younger patients has the potential to reduce the morbidity and cost of unnecessary therapies in young breast cancer patients.",Journal Article,1958.0,43.0,National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines consider 18 F-FDG PET/CT for only clinical stage III cancer patients However there is debate whether TNM staging should be the only factor in considering if PET/CT is warranted Patient age may be an additional consideration because young cancer patients often have more aggressive tumors with potential for earlier metastases This study assessed PET/CT for staging of asymptomatic cancer patients younger than 40 y In this Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective study our hospital information system was screened for cancer patients younger than 40 y who underwent staging PET/CT before any treatment Patients with symptoms or conventional imaging findings suggestive of distant metastases or with prior malignancy were excluded Initial stage was based on physical examination mammography ultrasound and MR imaging PET/CT was then evaluated to identify unsuspected extraaxillary regional nodal and distant metastases One hundred thirty-four patients with initial cancer stage I to IIIC met inclusion criteria PET/CT findings led to upstaging to stage III or IV in 28 patients 21 Unsuspected extraaxillary regional nodes were found in 15 of 134 patients 11 and distant metastases in 20 of 134 15 with 7 of 134 5 demonstrating both PET/CT revealed stage IV disease in 1 of 20 5 patients with initial clinical stage I 2 of 44 5 stage IIA 8 of 47 17 stage IIB 4 of 13 31 stage IIIA 4 of 8 50 stage IIIB and 1 of 2 50 stage IIIC All 20 patients upstaged to stage IV were histologically confirmed Four synchronous and 1 malignancies were identified PET/CT revealed distant metastases in 17 of asymptomatic stage IIB cancer patients younger than 40 y Although guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend against systemic staging in patients with stage II disease our data suggest that PET/CT might be valuable in younger patients with stage IIB and III disease Use of PET/CT in younger patients has the potential to reduce the morbidity and cost of unnecessary therapies in young cancer patients,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,"[657, 949, 12, 1801, 677, 2419, 203, 1068, 1285, 495, 425, 9, 158, 38, 82, 316, 12, 7, 137, 125, 16, 5220, 317, 2918, 632, 257, 40, 3, 158, 161, 4, 3075, 492, 495, 425, 16, 1197, 69, 89, 68, 40, 35, 402, 2415, 408, 1169, 12, 7, 629, 47, 80, 571, 57, 5, 174, 9, 1677, 196, 26, 45, 275, 495, 425, 9, 632, 1, 2100, 12, 7, 773, 76, 327, 2055, 4, 26, 1115, 206, 2620, 850, 459, 45, 114, 702, 487, 398, 10, 2261, 9, 12, 7, 773, 76, 327, 2055, 54, 208, 632, 495, 425, 348, 500, 24, 7, 5, 507, 15, 809, 270, 272, 3832, 1, 626, 196, 15, 5, 324, 710, 11, 1800, 388, 82, 10, 90, 23, 900, 1385, 2446, 1945, 2, 1638, 270, 495, 425, 10, 818, 194, 6, 255, 9073, 26515, 951, 779, 2, 626, 196, 104, 1128, 977, 294, 7, 5, 388, 12, 82, 70, 6, 3842, 543, 1680, 371, 495, 425, 272, 836, 6, 6335, 6, 82, 316, 15, 478, 4, 339, 7, 239, 9073, 26515, 951, 502, 11, 204, 4, 167, 1, 4842, 7, 175, 2, 626, 196, 4, 179, 1, 4842, 167, 5, 67, 1, 4842, 33, 2219, 110, 495, 425, 553, 82, 478, 34, 4, 14, 1, 179, 33, 7, 5, 388, 38, 82, 70, 18, 1, 584, 33, 82, 4088, 66, 1, 662, 269, 82, 3884, 39, 1, 233, 456, 82, 3164, 39, 1, 66, 212, 82, 3036, 2, 14, 1, 18, 212, 82, 3842, 62, 179, 7, 7250, 6, 82, 478, 11, 2161, 557, 294, 2734, 2, 14, 441, 11, 108, 495, 425, 553, 626, 196, 4, 269, 1, 2100, 82, 3884, 12, 7, 773, 76, 327, 2055, 242, 677, 1, 3, 657, 949, 12, 1801, 2237, 480, 403, 632, 4, 7, 5, 82, 215, 34, 114, 74, 309, 17, 495, 425, 822, 40, 2926, 4, 773, 7, 5, 82, 3884, 2, 316, 34, 119, 1, 495, 425, 4, 773, 7, 71, 3, 174, 6, 969, 3, 787, 2, 835, 1, 4224, 235, 4, 1169, 12, 7]",2070.0,25214641,133

Cancer Res.,2014-09-17,"To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for continuous oral administration of the γ-secretase inhibitor PF-03084014, determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D), and evaluate safety and preliminary activity in patients with advanced solid tumors. This open-label, phase I study consisted of a dose-finding portion based on a 3+3 design, followed by an expansion cohort. PF-03084014 was administered orally, twice daily (BID) for 21 continuous days. Tested doses ranged from 20 to 330 mg BID. In the expansion cohort, patients were to receive the estimated MTD or a lower dose of PF-03084014. A total of 64 patients received treatment. The MTD was estimated to be 220 mg BID. The RP2D was determined to be 150 mg BID, based on the better safety profile versus the 220-mg BID dose, given comparable NOTCH-related target inhibition. The most common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, hypophosphatemia, vomiting, rash, and decreased appetite, which were generally mild to moderate in severity. One patient with advanced thyroid cancer had a complete response, and five of seven response-evaluable patients with desmoid tumor achieved a partial response (71.4% objective response rate).

Pharmacokinetics of single-agent axitinib across multiple solid tumor types.,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol.,2014-10-22,"Axitinib, a potent and selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, showed antitumor activity as a single agent against several solid tumor types in Phase II and III trials. This study was conducted to evaluate axitinib pharmacokinetics across a variety of solid tumors. The current study analyzed the pharmacokinetics of axitinib in 110 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), thyroid cancer, or melanoma from three Phase II trials plus 127 healthy volunteers, using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Boxplots of maximum observed plasma concentration (C max) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of data from these tumor populations was compared to C max and AUC from the final population pharmacokinetic model developed for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) to compare axitinib pharmacokinetics across different tumor types. Axitinib disposition based on data from 237 subjects was best described using a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and lag time. Population estimates for systemic clearance, central volume of distribution, absorption rate constant, absolute bioavailability, and lag time were 20.1 L/h, 56.2 L, 1.26/h(-1), 0.663, and 0.448 h, respectively. Statistically significant covariates included gender on clearance, and body weight on central volume of distribution.

Efficacy and tolerability of vemurafenib in patients with BRAF(V600E) -positive papillary thyroid cancer: M.D. Anderson Cancer Center off label experience.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2015-01-01,"Vemurafenib, a selective BRAF inhibitor, appears to have promising clinical activity in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation. To determine the efficacy and safety of vemurafenib when used outside of a clinical trial. A retrospective review at MD Anderson Cancer Center. The best responses were evaluated using RECIST v1.1. A single radiologist reviewed all images. Adverse events (AEs) were evaluated using CTCAE v.4.0. We identified 17 patients with advanced PTC harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation who were treated with vemurafenib outside of a clinical trial. Median age at diagnosis was 63 years, and 53% were male. At vemurafenib start, 3 (18%) patients had disease confined to the neck, and 14 (72%) had distant metastases. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors had been previously administered to 4 (24%) patients. Two (12%) patients discontinued vemurafenib because of AEs before restaging. Best response: partial response (PR) in 7/15 (47%) and stable disease (SD) in 8/15(53%) patients. The rate of durable response (PR plus SD ≥ 6 months) was 67%. Median time to treatment failure was 13 months. There was no association between change in thyroglobulin and tumor size. Drug discontinuation, drug interruptions, and dose reductions were needed in 5 (29%), 13 (76%), and 10 (59%) patients, respectively. Most common AEs were fatigue (71%), weight loss (71%), anorexia (65%), arthralgias (59%), hair loss (59%), rash (59%), hand-foot syndrome (53%), calluses (47%), diarrhea (47%), fever (41%), dry mouth (35%), nausea (35%), and verrucous keratosis (35%).

When do changes in cancer survival mean progress? The insight from population incidence and mortality.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Monographs,J. Natl. Cancer Inst. Monographs,2014-11-01,"It is often assumed that increases in cancer survival reflect true progress against cancer. This is true when these increases are accompanied by decreased burden of disease: Fewer people being diagnosed or dying from cancer (ie, decreased incidence and mortality). But increased survival can also occur even when incidence is increasing and mortality is unchanged. To use trends in cancer burden-incidence and mortality-to illustrate when changes in survival reflect true progress. Using data from 1975 to 2010 collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (incidence, survival) and the National Center for Health Statistics (mortality), we analyzed US trends in five-year relative survival, age-adjusted incidence, and mortality for selected cancers to identify patterns that do and do not reflect progress. Among the nine common cancers examined, survival increased in seven, and changed little or not at all for two. In some cases, increased survival was accompanied by decreased burden of disease, reflecting true progress. For example, from 1975 to 2010, five-year survival for colon cancer patients improved (from 48% to 68%) while cancer burden fell: Fewer cases (incidence decreased from 60 to 41 per 100,000) and fewer deaths (mortality decreased from 28 to 16 per 100,000), a pattern explained by both increased early detection (with removal of cancer precursors) and more effective treatment. In other cases, however, increased survival did not reflect true progress. In melanoma, kidney, and thyroid cancer, five-year survival increased but incidence increased with no change in mortality. This pattern suggests overdiagnosis from increased early detection, an increase in cancer burden. Changes in survival must be interpreted in the context of incidence and mortality. Increased survival only represents progress when accompanied by a reduction in incidence, mortality, or ideally both.",Journal Article,1907.0,59.0,"It is often assumed that increases in cancer survival reflect true progress against cancer This is true when these increases are accompanied by decreased burden of disease Fewer people being diagnosed or dying from cancer ie decreased incidence and mortality But increased survival can also occur even when incidence is increasing and mortality is unchanged To use trends in cancer burden-incidence and mortality-to illustrate when changes in survival reflect true progress Using data from 1975 to 2010 collected by the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Program incidence survival and the National Center for Health Statistics mortality we analyzed US trends in five-year relative survival age-adjusted incidence and mortality for selected cancers to identify patterns that do and do not reflect progress Among the nine common cancers examined survival increased in seven and changed little or not at all for two In some cases increased survival was accompanied by decreased burden of disease reflecting true progress For example from 1975 to 2010 five-year survival for cancer patients improved from 48 to 68 while cancer burden fell Fewer cases incidence decreased from 60 to 41 per 100,000 and fewer deaths mortality decreased from 28 to 16 per 100,000 a pattern explained by both increased early detection with removal of cancer precursors and more effective treatment In other cases however increased survival did not reflect true progress In and cancer five-year survival increased but incidence increased with no change in mortality This pattern suggests overdiagnosis from increased early detection an increase in cancer burden Changes in survival must be interpreted in the context of incidence and mortality Increased survival only represents progress when accompanied by a reduction in incidence mortality or ideally both",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[192, 16, 629, 6719, 17, 1106, 4, 12, 25, 2694, 2501, 1466, 480, 12, 26, 16, 2501, 198, 46, 1106, 32, 2756, 20, 340, 892, 1, 34, 1497, 3788, 486, 265, 15, 4536, 29, 12, 2523, 340, 287, 2, 282, 84, 101, 25, 122, 120, 1271, 871, 198, 287, 16, 602, 2, 282, 16, 4639, 6, 119, 1963, 4, 12, 892, 287, 2, 282, 6, 4746, 198, 400, 4, 25, 2694, 2501, 1466, 75, 74, 29, 7585, 6, 1120, 786, 20, 3, 617, 1284, 2, 396, 99, 1243, 287, 25, 2, 3, 657, 574, 9, 341, 3065, 282, 21, 311, 843, 1963, 4, 365, 111, 580, 25, 89, 586, 287, 2, 282, 9, 715, 163, 6, 255, 764, 17, 1022, 2, 1022, 44, 2694, 1466, 107, 3, 762, 186, 163, 409, 25, 101, 4, 648, 2, 2368, 1215, 15, 44, 28, 62, 9, 100, 4, 476, 140, 101, 25, 10, 2756, 20, 340, 892, 1, 34, 4777, 2501, 1466, 9, 2685, 29, 7585, 6, 1120, 365, 111, 25, 9, 12, 7, 231, 29, 576, 6, 806, 369, 12, 892, 7689, 1497, 140, 287, 340, 29, 335, 6, 605, 379, 394, 984, 2, 1497, 1043, 282, 340, 29, 339, 6, 245, 379, 394, 984, 8, 1177, 3672, 20, 110, 101, 191, 638, 5, 2829, 1, 12, 4881, 2, 80, 323, 24, 4, 127, 140, 137, 101, 25, 205, 44, 2694, 2501, 1466, 4, 2, 12, 365, 111, 25, 101, 84, 287, 101, 5, 77, 707, 4, 282, 26, 1177, 844, 10700, 29, 101, 191, 638, 35, 344, 4, 12, 892, 400, 4, 25, 1642, 40, 5047, 4, 3, 1533, 1, 287, 2, 282, 101, 25, 158, 1449, 1466, 198, 2756, 20, 8, 628, 4, 287, 282, 15, 8160, 110]",1840.0,25417232,74

Methods We performed a phase I study of XL281 in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients were enrolled in successive cohorts of XL281 orally once daily in 28-day cycles. Twice daily dosing, different formulations, and the effect of food and famotidine were also studied. At the MTD expanded cohorts with defined mutations were treated. Results In total, 160 patients were treated. The MTD on the QD schedule was 150 mg. The most common toxicities were diarrhea, nausea, and fatigue. Plasma Cmax and AUC increased with dose. Famotidine resulted in lower AUC while food had no effect. Two patients had partial responses by RECIST: One with papillary thyroid cancer with NRAS mutation and one with uveal melanoma. Another nine patients had tumor decrease of >10% but did not meet RECIST criteria for PR. Matched tumors pairs from 33 patients showed evidence of RAF inhibition with significant decreases in pERK, pMEK and pAKT.

Correlation of degree of hypothyroidism with survival outcomes in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma receiving vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors.,Clinical genitourinary cancer,Clin Genitourin Cancer,2014-11-15,"Hypothyroidism is a common adverse effect of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGFR-TKI) therapy in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Some studies have shown an association with improved survival. However, hypothyroidism severity has not been correlated with survival outcomes. We report the incidence and severity of VEGFR-TKI therapy-associated hypothyroidism in correlation with the survival outcomes of patients with mRCC. A retrospective analysis of patients with mRCC who received VEGFR-TKIs (2004 through 2013) was conducted from a single institutional database. Hypothyroidism, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were assessed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models. Of 125 patients with mRCC, 65 were eligible. Their median age was 59 years (range, 45-79 years), and 46 (70.8%) were male. Hypothyroidism occurred in 25 patients (38.5%), of whom 13 had a peak thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level > 10 mIU/L during treatment.

Unique characteristics and outcomes of patients diagnosed with both primary thyroid and primary renal cell carcinoma.,Endocrine practice : official journal of the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists,Endocr Pract,2014-12-22,"Patients with multiple primary malignancies may exhibit unique clinical characteristics that suggest a common predisposition or lead to different disease management. Given the association of primary thyroid (TC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC), we characterized the clinicopathologic features of patients treated for both malignancies (TC/RCC). TC/RCC patients were identified through the institutional tumor registry and using data compiled by retrospective chart review. To compare with broader institutional and national cohorts, we examined patients admitted with TC or RCC institution-wide and reviewed the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program for these cancers. Overall, 51% of patients developed TC before RCC, 27% developed RCC before TC, and 22% were diagnosed within 1 year of each other. The mean age at TC diagnosis was 52 ± 15 (18-77), which was significantly older than institutional TC patients (45 ± 16.5 years, P≤.0001), and the mean age at RCC diagnosis was 59 ± 12 (32-79).

RET fusion as a novel driver of medullary thyroid carcinoma.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2014-12-29,"Oncogenic RET tyrosine kinase gene fusions and activating mutations have recently been identified in lung cancers, prompting initiation of targeted therapy trials in this disease. Although RET point mutation has been identified as a driver of tumorigenesis in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), no fusions have been described to date. We evaluated the role of RET fusion as an oncogenic driver in MTC. We describe a patient who died from aggressive sporadic MTC < 10 months after diagnosis. Her tumor was evaluated by means of next-generation sequencing, including an intronic capture strategy. A reciprocal translocation involving RET intron 12 was identified. The fusion was validated using a targeted break apart fluorescence in situ hybridization probe, and RNA sequencing confirmed the existence of an in-frame fusion transcript joining MYH13 exon 35 with RET exon 12. Ectopic expression of fusion product in a murine Ba/F3 cell reporter model established strong oncogenicity. Three tyrosine kinase inhibitors currently used to treat MTC in clinical practice blocked tumorigenic cell growth. This finding represents the report of a novel RET fusion, the first of its kind described in MTC. The finding of this potential novel oncogenic mechanism has clear implications for sporadic MTC, which in the majority of cases has no driver mutation identified.

"Expression, Clinical Significance, and Receptor Identification of the Newest B7 Family Member HHLA2 Protein.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2014-12-30,"HHLA2 (B7H7/B7-H5/B7y) is a newly identified B7 family member that regulates human T-cell functions. However, its protein expression in human organs and significance in human diseases are unknown. The objective of this study was to analyze HHLA2 protein expression in normal human tissues and cancers, as well as its prognostic significance, to explore mechanisms regulating HHLA2 expression, and to identify candidate HHLA2 receptors. An immunohistochemistry protocol and a flow cytometry assay with newly generated monoclonal antibodies were developed to examine HHLA2 protein. HHLA2 gene copy-number variation was analyzed from cancer genomic data. The combination of bioinformatics analysis and immunologic approaches was established to explore HHLA2 receptors. HHLA2 protein was detected in trophoblastic cells of the placenta and the epithelium of gut, kidney, gallbladder, and breast, but not in most other organs. In contrast, HHLA2 protein was widely expressed in human cancers from the breast, lung, thyroid, melanoma, pancreas, ovary, liver, bladder, colon, prostate, kidney, and esophagus. In a cohort of 50 patients with stage I-III triple-negative breast cancer, 56% of patients had aberrant expression of HHLA2 on their tumors, and high HHLA2 expression was significantly associated with regional lymph node metastasis and stage. The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that HHLA2 copy-number gains were present in 29% of basal breast cancers, providing a potential mechanism for increased HHLA2 protein expression in breast cancer. Finally, Transmembrane and Immunoglobulin Domain Containing 2 (TMIGD2) was identified as one of the receptors for HHLA2. Wide expression of HHLA2 in human malignancies, together with its association with poor prognostic factors and its T-cell coinhibitory capability, suggests that the HHLA2 pathway represents a novel immunosuppressive mechanism within the tumor microenvironment and an attractive target for human cancer therapy.",Journal Article,1848.0,43.0,HHLA2 B7H7/B7-H5/B7y is a newly identified B7 family member that regulates human T-cell functions However its protein expression in human organs and significance in human diseases are unknown The objective of this study was to analyze HHLA2 protein expression in normal human tissues and cancers as well as its prognostic significance to explore mechanisms regulating HHLA2 expression and to identify candidate HHLA2 receptors An immunohistochemistry protocol and a flow cytometry assay with newly generated monoclonal antibodies were developed to examine HHLA2 protein HHLA2 gene copy-number variation was analyzed from cancer genomic data The combination of bioinformatics analysis and immunologic approaches was established to explore HHLA2 receptors HHLA2 protein was detected in trophoblastic cells of the placenta and the epithelium of gut and but not in most other organs In contrast HHLA2 protein was widely expressed in human cancers from the ovary and In a cohort of 50 patients with stage I-III triple-negative cancer 56 of patients had aberrant expression of HHLA2 on their tumors and high HHLA2 expression was significantly associated with regional lymph node metastasis and stage The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that HHLA2 copy-number gains were present in 29 of basal cancers providing a potential mechanism for increased HHLA2 protein expression in cancer Finally Transmembrane and Immunoglobulin Domain Containing 2 TMIGD2 was identified as one of the receptors for HHLA2 Wide expression of HHLA2 in human malignancies together with its association with poor prognostic factors and its T-cell coinhibitory capability suggests that the HHLA2 pathway represents a novel immunosuppressive mechanism within the tumor microenvironment and an attractive target for human cancer therapy,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,"[11888, 65403, 3181, 19811, 65404, 16, 8, 732, 108, 3181, 607, 2693, 17, 2468, 171, 102, 31, 1681, 137, 211, 178, 55, 4, 171, 2285, 2, 724, 4, 171, 1342, 32, 860, 3, 461, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 1992, 11888, 178, 55, 4, 295, 171, 742, 2, 163, 22, 149, 22, 211, 177, 724, 6, 1645, 483, 2681, 11888, 55, 2, 6, 255, 1609, 11888, 1186, 35, 888, 1182, 2, 8, 1412, 1914, 719, 5, 732, 1419, 848, 890, 11, 276, 6, 1004, 11888, 178, 11888, 145, 1337, 207, 1380, 10, 311, 29, 12, 572, 74, 3, 150, 1, 6579, 65, 2, 3042, 611, 10, 635, 6, 1645, 11888, 1186, 11888, 178, 10, 530, 4, 11355, 37, 1, 3, 19600, 2, 3, 2781, 1, 7600, 2, 84, 44, 4, 96, 127, 2285, 4, 748, 11888, 178, 10, 1792, 570, 4, 171, 163, 29, 3, 3631, 2, 4, 8, 180, 1, 212, 7, 5, 82, 70, 316, 1500, 199, 12, 664, 1, 7, 42, 1898, 55, 1, 11888, 23, 136, 57, 2, 64, 11888, 55, 10, 97, 41, 5, 951, 263, 289, 278, 2, 82, 3, 12, 898, 2643, 553, 17, 11888, 1337, 207, 3849, 11, 364, 4, 462, 1, 2135, 163, 1736, 8, 174, 670, 9, 101, 11888, 178, 55, 4, 12, 1368, 5527, 2, 2593, 1398, 1101, 18, 48770, 10, 108, 22, 104, 1, 3, 1186, 9, 11888, 1019, 55, 1, 11888, 4, 171, 441, 1162, 5, 211, 248, 5, 334, 177, 130, 2, 211, 102, 31, 10928, 6188, 844, 17, 3, 11888, 308, 1449, 8, 229, 2989, 670, 262, 3, 30, 995, 2, 35, 3059, 283, 9, 171, 12, 36]",1797.0,25549724,98

Retrospective study in an established cohort of CCS with 748 participants treated with CRT (394 men; mean age, 34.2 years [range, 19.4 to 59.6 years] observed for a mean of 27.3 years [range, 10.8 to 47.7 years]). Multivariable logistic regression was used to study associations between demographic and treatment-related risk factors and pituitary deficiencies, as well as associations between untreated deficiencies and cardiovascular health, bone mineral density (BMD), and physical fitness. The estimated point prevalence was 46.5% for GHD, 10.8% for LH/FSHD, 7.5% for TSHD, and 4% for ACTHD, and the cumulative incidence increased with follow-up. GHD and LH/FSHD were not treated in 99.7% and 78.5% of affected individuals, respectively. Male sex and obesity were significantly associated with LH/FSHD; white race was significant associated with LH/FSHD and TSHD.

Data on prevalence, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and molecular genetics in a systematic series of such patients are pending. We performed a multinational population-based study on thyroid paraganglioma and analyzed prevalence, IHC, and molecular genetics. Patients with thyroid paraganglioma were recruited from the European-American-Head-and-Neck-Paraganglioma-Registry. Demographic and clinical data were registered. Histopathology and IHC were re-investigated. All patients with thyroid paraganglioma underwent molecular genetic analyses of the SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF2, VHL, RET, TMEM127, and MAX genes. Analyses included Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for detection of large rearrangements. Of 947 registrants, eight candidates were initially identified. After immunohistochemical analyses of these eight subjects, 5 (0.5%) were confirmed to have thyroid paraganglioma. IHC was positive for chromogranin, synaptophysin, and S-100 and negative for calcitonin in all five thyroid paragangliomas, whereas the three excluded candidate tumors stained positive for pan-cytokeratin, a marker excluding endocrine tumors. Germline variants, probably representing mutations, were found in four of the five confirmed thyroid paraganglioma cases, two each in SDHA and SDHB, whereas the excluded cases had no mutations in the tested genes. Thyroid paraganglioma is a finite entity, which must be differentiated from medullary thyroid carcinoma, because medical, surgical, and genetic management for each is different. Notably, approximately 80% of thyroid paragangliomas are associated with germline variants, with implications for additional tumors and a potential risk for the family.

Genetic profiling of advanced radioactive iodine-resistant differentiated thyroid cancer and correlation with axitinib efficacy.,Cancer letters,Cancer Lett.,2015-01-29,"Biomarkers predicting which patients with advanced radioiodine-resistant differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) may benefit from multi-kinase inhibitors are unavailable. We aimed to describe molecular markers in DTC that correlate with clinical outcome to axitinib. Pretreatment thyroid cancer blocks from 18 patients treated with axitinib were collected and genomic DNA was isolated. The OncoCarta™ Mutation Panel was used to test for 238 oncogenic mutations. Copy number of VEGFR1-3 and PIK3CA was determined using qPCR on enriched tumor samples. Genomic DNA was analyzed for all coding regions of VEGFR1-3 with custom primers. Protein expressions of VEGFR1-3, c-Met, and PIK3CA were evaluated with immunohistochemistry. Clinical response to axitinib, including best response (BR) and progression free survival (PFS), was ascertained from corresponding patients. Fisher's exact test and logistic regression models were used to correlate BR with molecular findings. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to correlate PFS with molecular defects. A total of 22 pathology samples (10 primary, 12 metastatic) were identified. In patients with 2 samples (n = 4), genetic results were concordant and only included once for analysis. Tumors from 4 patients (22%) harbored BRAF V600E mutations, 2 (11%) had KRAS mutations (G12A, G13D) and 2 (11%) had HRAS mutations (Q61R, Q61K). One metastatic sample with mutated KRAS also harbored a PIK3CA (H1047R) mutation. qPCR showed increased copy numbers of PIK3CA in 6 (33%) tumors, VEGFR1 in 0 (0%) tumors, VEGFR2 in 4 (22%) tumors, and VEGFR3 in 6 (33%) tumors. VEGFR sequencing was significant for a possibly damaging non-synonymous SNP in VEGFR2 (G539R) in 2 samples (11%), a possibly damaging SNP in VEGFR3 (E350V) in 1 sample (6%), and a potentially novel mutation in VEGFR2 (T439I) in 2 samples (11%). Immunohistochemistry (VEGFR1, -2, -3; c-MET; PIK3CA) revealed positive staining in the majority of samples. No significant relationship was seen between BR or PFS and the presence of molecular alterations. Molecular evaluation of DTC specimens did not predict clinical response to axitinib but our data were limited by sample size.

KLLN epigenotype-phenotype associations in Cowden syndrome.,European journal of human genetics : EJHG,Eur. J. Hum. Genet.,2015-02-11,"Germline KLLN promoter hypermethylation was recently identified as a potential genetic etiology of the cancer predisposition syndrome, Cowden syndrome (CS), when no causal PTEN gene mutation was found. We screened for KLLN promoter methylation in a large prospective series of CS patients and determined the risk of benign and malignant CS features in patients with increased methylation both with and without a PTEN mutation/variant of unknown significance. In all, 1012 CS patients meeting relaxed International Cowden Consortium criteria including 261 PTEN mutation-positive CS patients, 187 PTEN variant-positive CS patients and 564 PTEN mutation-negative CS patients, as well as 111 population controls were assessed for germline KLLN promoter methylation by MassARRAY EpiTYPER analysis. KLLN promoter methylation was analyzed both as a continuous and a dichotomous variable in the calculation of phenotypic risks by stepwise logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier/standardized incidence ratio methods, respectively. Significantly increased KLLN promoter methylation was seen in CS individuals with and without a PTEN mutation/VUS compared with controls (P<0.001). Patients with high KLLN promoter methylation have increased risks of all CS-associated malignancies compared with the general population. Interestingly, KLLN-associated risk of thyroid cancer appears to be gender and PTEN status dependent. KLLN promoter methylation associated with different benign phenotypes dependent on PTEN status. Furthermore, increasing KLLN promoter methylation is associated with a greater phenotype burden in mutation-negative CS patients. Germline promoter hypermethylation of KLLN is associated with particular malignant and benign CS features, which is dependent on the PTEN mutation status.

In our phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study involving patients with progressive thyroid cancer that was refractory to iodine-131, we randomly assigned 261 patients to receive lenvatinib (at a daily dose of 24 mg per day in 28-day cycles) and 131 patients to receive placebo. At the time of disease progression, patients in the placebo group could receive open-label lenvatinib. The primary end point was progression-free survival. Secondary end points included the response rate, overall survival, and safety. The median progression-free survival was 18.3 months in the lenvatinib group and 3.6 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.21; 99% confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.31; P<0.001). A progression-free survival benefit associated with lenvatinib was observed in all prespecified subgroups. The response rate was 64.8% in the lenvatinib group (4 complete responses and 165 partial responses) and 1.5% in the placebo group (P<0.001). The median overall survival was not reached in either group. Treatment-related adverse effects of any grade, which occurred in more than 40% of patients in the lenvatinib group, were hypertension (in 67.8% of the patients), diarrhea (in 59.4%), fatigue or asthenia (in 59.0%), decreased appetite (in 50.2%), decreased weight (in 46.4%), and nausea (in 41.0%). Discontinuations of the study drug because of adverse effects occurred in 37 patients who received lenvatinib (14.2%) and 3 patients who received placebo (2.3%). In the lenvatinib group, 6 of 20 deaths that occurred during the treatment period were considered to be drug-related. Lenvatinib, as compared with placebo, was associated with significant improvements in progression-free survival and the response rate among patients with iodine-131-refractory thyroid cancer. Patients who received lenvatinib had more adverse effects.

Germline and somatic SDHx alterations in apparently sporadic differentiated thyroid cancer.,Endocrine-related cancer,Endocr. Relat. Cancer,2015-04-01,"Along with breast and endometrial cancers, thyroid cancer is a major component cancer in Cowden syndrome (CS). Germline variants in SDHB/C/D (SDHx) genes account for subsets of CS/CS-like cases, conferring a higher risk of breast and thyroid cancers over those with only germline PTEN mutations. To investigate whether SDHx alterations at both germline and somatic levels occur in apparently sporadic breast cancer and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), we analyzed SDHx genes in the following four groups: i) 48 individuals with sporadic invasive breast adenocarcinoma for germline mutation; ii) 48 (expanded to 241) DTC for germline mutation; iii) 37 pairs DTC tumor-normal tissues for germline and somatic mutation and mRNA expression levels; and iv) data from 476 patients in the Cancer Genome Atlas thyroid carcinoma dataset for validation. No germline SDHx variant was found in a pilot series of 48 breast cancer cases. As germline SDHx variants were found in our pilot of 48 thyroid cancer cases, we expanded to three series of DTC comprising a total 754 cases, and found 48 (6%) with germline SDHx variants (P<0.001 compared with 0/350 controls). In 513 tumors, we found 27 (5%) with large somatic duplications within chromosome 1 encompassing SDHC.

Increasing diagnosis of subclinical thyroid cancers leads to spurious improvements in survival rates.,Cancer,Cancer,2015-02-24,"Survival rates are commonly used to measure success in treating cancer, but can be misleading. Modern diagnostic practices can lead to the appearance of improving cancer survival, as tumors are diagnosed earlier (lead-time bias) or as an increasing proportion are slow-growing (length bias), whereas the actual burden of cancer deaths is unchanged. Increasingly, more subclinical thyroid cancers are being diagnosed. The objective of the current study was to determine whether thyroid cancer survival rates have been affected by this phenomenon. The authors analyzed survival data from patients with thyroid cancer who were treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) from 1950 to 2005, and United States population-based incidence, prevalence, and survival data from 1973 to 2009 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data set. US thyroid cancer incidence has increased 3-fold from 1975 to 2009. Over time, the proportion of thyroid cancers that are subcentimeter in size has increased from 23% (1983) to 36% (2009). At MSKCC, this percentage rose from 20% (1950) to 35% (2005). The incidence rates of large tumors (>6 cm) and distant metastasis have not changed. In the United States, 10-year relative survival improved from 95.4% to 98.6% (1983-1999). At MSKCC, 10-year disease-specific survival improved from 91.1% to 96.1% (1950-2005). However, when stratified by tumor size and stage, no changes in survival outcomes were observed. US thyroid cancer mortality rates have remained stable (1975-2009). Modern medical practices increasingly uncover small, asymptomatic thyroid cancers. Survival rates appear improved, but this finding is spurious, attributable instead to shifts in the characteristics of disease being diagnosed. Relying on survival rates to measure success in treating thyroid cancer may reinforce inappropriately aggressive management.

Studies describing models that (1) predicted the absolute risk of a late effect present at least 1 year post-treatment, and (2) could be used in a clinical setting. Three authors independently extracted data pertaining to patient characteristics, late effects, the prediction model and model evaluation. Across 14 studies identified for review, nine late effects were predicted: erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence after prostate cancer; arm lymphoedema, psychological morbidity, cardiomyopathy or heart failure and cardiac event after breast cancer; swallowing dysfunction after head and neck cancer; breast cancer after Hodgkin lymphoma and thyroid cancer after childhood cancer. Of these, four late effects are persistent effects of treatment and five appear after a latent period. Two studies were externally validated. Six studies were designed to inform decisions about treatment rather than survivorship care. Nomograms were the most common clinical output. Despite the call among survivorship experts for risk stratification, few published models are useful for risk-stratifying prevention, early detection or management of late effects.

Effects of endocrine therapy on the prognosis of elderly patients after surgery for papillary thyroid carcinoma.,European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,2015-03-06,"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is a common thyroid malignancy. Elderly patients have more severe disease and more complications following postoperative endocrine therapy to control thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. We aimed to identify optimal postoperative serum TSH levels in elderly patients to prevent recurrence and metastasis and minimize complications. This retrospective cohort study collected data of 87 consecutive elderly patients (age >75) who underwent surgery for PTC with postoperative levothyroxine therapy (50-150 μg/d) between January 2006 and June 2008 and were followed until 2013. After 24 patients with TSH fluctuations and incomplete data were excluded, 73 patients were grouped based on postoperative TSH levels: Group A, 0.3-0.5 mIU/mL; Group B, 0.1-0.3 mIU/mL; and Group C <0.1 mIU/mL (n = 24, 25, 24, respectively). Subjects' baseline, preoperative data, postoperative complications and 1-, 3- and 5-year follow-up data were compared between groups. No significant differences in gender, age (median age of 80 years old), surgery type or clinical characteristics were found between groups (all p value >0.05). Postoperatively, all subjects had normal ECG and neck ultrasound, no osteoporosis, and no differences in survival rate or metastasis.

Incidence of secondary malignancies among patients with Waldenström macroglobulinemia: An analysis of the SEER database.,Cancer,Cancer,2015-03-10,"Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) is an indolent malignancy that predominantly affects older individuals who are at risk for secondary malignancies (SMs). The objective of this study was to characterize the incidence of SMs after a diagnosis of WM with the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. With SEER-13 data (1992-2011), standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the rates of solid and hematologic SMs in WM patients versus the general population. The analysis was stratified by age, sex, race, year of diagnosis, and latency from the WM diagnosis. Among 4676 patients with WM, 681 SMs were recorded. The overall SIR was 1.49 (95% CI, 1.38-1.61), and the median time to an SM was 3.7 years. The cumulative incidence of SMs was 10% at 5 years and 16% at 10 years. The risk was significantly increased for cancers of the lungs, urinary tract, and thyroid; melanoma; aggressive lymphoma; and acute leukemia. The SIR for SMs in patients with WM was increased, regardless of age, sex, race, or year of diagnosis. Patients with WM had a 49% higher risk of SMs than the general population.

Increased risk of second primary malignancy in pediatric and young adult patients treated with radioactive iodine for differentiated thyroid cancer.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2015-05-06,"The long-term sequelae of radioactive iodine (RAI) for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) in pediatric and young adult patients are not well-defined. Epidemiologic analyses of second primary malignancy (SPM) risk have only been performed in the adult population. Existing data are limited to case series with limited follow-up. The objective of this study was to analyze the elevated risk of SPM attributable to RAI in young patients treated for DTC. Population-based analysis of 3850 pediatric and young adult patients (<25 years old) undergoing treatment with surgery with/without RAI for DTC, followed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry (1973-2008), equating to 54,727 person-years at risk (PYR). The excess risk of SPM was calculated relative to a reference population and expressed as standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and excess absolute risk (EAR) per 10,000 PYR. Excess risk was compared in RAI-treated and non-RAI-treated patients. A total of 1571 patients (40%) received RAI. The percentage of patients treated with RAI increased over time, from 4% in 1973 to 62% in 2008 (p<0.001). Among patients who received RAI, 26 SPMs were observed, and 18.3 were expected. The relative risk of SPM at any site was significantly elevated (SIR=1.42), corresponding to 4.4 excess cases per 10,000 PYR. SPM risk was not elevated in the non-RAI-treated cohort (SIR=1.01, EAR=0). Patients treated with RAI were at dramatically elevated risk for development of a salivary malignancy (SIR=34.1), corresponding to 1.7 excess cases per 10,000 PYR. The risk of leukemia in RAI-treated patients was elevated (SIR=4.0, EAR=0.9) but did not reach statistical significance. There was no elevated risk of salivary cancer or leukemia in the non-RAI-treated cohort. Pediatric and young adult patients who receive RAI for DTC experience an elevated risk of SPM, mainly salivary gland cancer. These risks appear to be only slightly higher than in adult patients. Over a decade, approximately 1 in 227 RAI-treated patients will develop an SPM, and 1 in 588 RAI-treated patients will develop a salivary cancer, attributable to RAI. Because the expected survival time for young DTC patients is long, it is critical to weigh the benefits of RAI carefully against the small, but real, increase in SPM risk.",Journal Article,1721.0,32.0,"The long-term sequelae of radioactive iodine RAI for differentiated cancer DTC in pediatric and young adult patients are not well-defined Epidemiologic analyses of second primary malignancy SPM risk have only been performed in the adult population Existing data are limited to case series with limited follow-up The objective of this study was to analyze the elevated risk of SPM attributable to RAI in young patients treated for DTC Population-based analysis of 3850 pediatric and young adult patients 25 years old undergoing treatment with surgery with/without RAI for DTC followed in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results cancer registry 1973-2008 equating to 54,727 person-years at risk PYR The excess risk of SPM was calculated relative to a reference population and expressed as standardized incidence ratio SIR and excess absolute risk EAR per 10,000 PYR Excess risk was compared in RAI-treated and non-RAI-treated patients A total of 1571 patients 40 received RAI The percentage of patients treated with RAI increased over time from 4 in 1973 to 62 in 2008 p 0.001 Among patients who received RAI 26 SPMs were observed and 18.3 were expected The relative risk of SPM at any site was significantly elevated SIR=1.42 corresponding to 4.4 excess cases per 10,000 PYR SPM risk was not elevated in the non-RAI-treated cohort SIR=1.01 EAR=0 Patients treated with RAI were at dramatically elevated risk for development of a malignancy SIR=34.1 corresponding to 1.7 excess cases per 10,000 PYR The risk of in RAI-treated patients was elevated SIR=4.0 EAR=0.9 but did not reach statistical significance There was no elevated risk of cancer or in the non-RAI-treated cohort Pediatric and young adult patients who receive RAI for DTC experience an elevated risk of SPM mainly gland cancer These risks appear to be only slightly higher than in adult patients Over a decade approximately 1 in 227 RAI-treated patients will develop an SPM and 1 in 588 RAI-treated patients will develop a cancer attributable to RAI Because the expected survival time for young DTC patients is long it is critical to weigh the benefits of RAI carefully against the small but real increase in SPM risk",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[3, 319, 337, 4156, 1, 4741, 4287, 4121, 9, 1442, 12, 5201, 4, 815, 2, 1169, 780, 7, 32, 44, 149, 395, 3609, 318, 1, 419, 86, 710, 8208, 43, 47, 158, 85, 173, 4, 3, 780, 266, 1692, 74, 32, 383, 6, 473, 988, 5, 383, 166, 126, 3, 461, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 1992, 3, 804, 43, 1, 8208, 2971, 6, 4121, 4, 1169, 7, 73, 9, 5201, 266, 90, 65, 1, 41056, 815, 2, 1169, 780, 7, 243, 60, 1095, 479, 24, 5, 152, 5, 187, 4121, 9, 5201, 370, 4, 3, 617, 1284, 2, 396, 99, 12, 1608, 4756, 1375, 31779, 6, 667, 14093, 2719, 60, 28, 43, 17475, 3, 2612, 43, 1, 8208, 10, 981, 580, 6, 8, 2482, 266, 2, 570, 22, 1670, 287, 197, 3636, 2, 2612, 1766, 43, 7815, 379, 79, 984, 17475, 2612, 43, 10, 72, 4, 4121, 73, 2, 220, 4121, 73, 7, 8, 181, 1, 40199, 7, 327, 103, 4121, 3, 1150, 1, 7, 73, 5, 4121, 101, 252, 98, 29, 39, 4, 4756, 6, 744, 4, 1375, 19, 13, 144, 107, 7, 54, 103, 4121, 432, 14029, 11, 164, 2, 203, 27, 11, 1336, 3, 580, 43, 1, 8208, 28, 500, 606, 10, 97, 804, 3636, 14, 595, 1734, 6, 39, 39, 2612, 140, 379, 79, 984, 17475, 8208, 43, 10, 44, 804, 4, 3, 220, 4121, 73, 180, 3636, 14, 355, 7815, 13, 7, 73, 5, 4121, 11, 28, 2729, 804, 43, 9, 193, 1, 8, 710, 3636, 562, 14, 1734, 6, 14, 67, 2612, 140, 379, 79, 984, 17475, 3, 43, 1, 4, 4121, 73, 7, 10, 804, 3636, 39, 13, 7815, 13, 83, 84, 205, 44, 3690, 1050, 724, 125, 10, 77, 804, 43, 1, 12, 15, 4, 3, 220, 4121, 73, 180, 815, 2, 1169, 780, 7, 54, 560, 4121, 9, 5201, 730, 35, 804, 43, 1, 8208, 2615, 2326, 12, 46, 1098, 1322, 6, 40, 158, 3223, 142, 76, 4, 780, 7, 252, 8, 2025, 705, 14, 4, 7132, 4121, 73, 7, 303, 690, 35, 8208, 2, 14, 4, 14064, 4121, 73, 7, 303, 690, 8, 12, 2971, 6, 4121, 408, 3, 1336, 25, 98, 9, 1169, 5201, 7, 16, 319, 192, 16, 740, 6, 14084, 3, 1141, 1, 4121, 3900, 480, 3, 302, 84, 1589, 344, 4, 8208, 43]",2184.0,25851829,448
Wide Inter-institutional Variation in Performance of a Molecular Classifier for Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2015-04-11,"The Afirma gene expression classifier (GEC) is used to assess malignancy risk in indeterminate thyroid nodules (ITNs) classified as Bethesda category III/IV. Our objective was to analyze GEC performance at two institutions with high thyroid cytopathology volumes but differing prevalence of malignancy. Retrospective analysis of all ITNs evaluated with the GEC at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK; n = 94) and Mount Sinai Beth Israel (MSBI; n = 71). These institutions have differing prevalences of malignancy in ITNs: 30-38 % (MSK) and 10-19 % (MSBI). Surgical pathology was correlated with GEC findings for each matched nodule. Performance characteristics were estimated using Bayes Theorem. Patient and nodule characteristics were similar at MSK and MSBI. The GEC-benign call rates were 38.3 % (MSK) and 52.1 % (MSBI). Of the GEC-benign nodules, 8.3 % (MSK) and 13.5 % (MSBI) were treated surgically. Surgical pathology indicated that all of GEC-benign nodules were benign. Of the GEC-suspicious nodules, 60.0 % (MSK) and 61.7 % (MSBI) underwent surgery. Positive predictive values (PPVs) for GEC-suspicious results were 57.1 % (95 % CI 41.0-72.3) at MSK and 14.3 % (95 % CI 0.2-30.2) at MSBI. The estimated negative predictive values (NPVs) were 86-92 % at MSK and 95-98 % at MSBI. There were wide variations in the Afirma GEC-benign call rate, PPV, and NPV between MSBI (a comprehensive health system) and MSK (a tertiary referral cancer center), which had differing rates of malignancy in ITNs.

We reviewed the charts of 490 consecutive patients with stage IE or IIE MZL referred between 1992 and 2012 to our institution. Of those, 244 patients (50%) were treated with RT alone. Pathology was confirmed by hematopathologists at our institution. Patient and disease factors were analyzed for association with relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Median age of the cohort was 59 years, and median follow-up was 5.2 years. Ann Arbor stage was IE in 92%. Most common disease sites were stomach (50%), orbit (18%), non-thyroid head-and-neck (8%), skin (8%), and breast (5%). Median RT dose was 30 Gy. Five-year OS and RFS were 92% and 74%, respectively. Cumulative incidence of disease-specific death was just 1.1% by 5 years. Sixty patients (24%) developed relapse of disease; 10 were in the RT field. Crude rate of transformation to pathologically confirmed large-cell lymphoma was 1.6%. On multivariable analysis, primary disease site (P=.007) was independently associated with RFS, along with age (P=.04), presence of B-symptoms (P=.02), and International Prognostic Index risk group (P=.03). All disease sites except for head-and-neck had worse RFS relative to stomach. Overall and cause-specific survival are high in early-stage extra-nodal MZL treated with curative RT alone. In this large cohort of 244 patients, most patients did not experience relapse of MZL after curative RT; when relapses did occur, the majority were in distant sites.

Reevaluation and reclassification of resected lung carcinomas originally diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma using immunohistochemical analysis.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2015-09-01,"Currently, non-small cell lung carcinomas are primarily classified by light microscopy. However, recent studies have shown that poorly differentiated tumors are more accurately classified by immunohistochemistry. In this study, we investigated the use of immunohistochemical analysis in reclassifying lung carcinomas that were originally diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma. Tumor slides and blocks were available for histologic evaluation, and tissue microarrays were constructed from 480 patients with resected lung carcinomas originally diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma between 1999 and 2009. Immunohistochemical analyses for p40, p63, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1; clones SPT24 and 8G7G3/1), napsin A, chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and CD56 were performed. Staining intensity (weak, moderate, or strong) and distribution (focal or diffuse) were also recorded. Of all, 449 (93.5%) patients were confirmed as having squamous cell carcinomas; the cases were mostly diffusely positive for p40 and negative for TTF-1 (8G7G3/1). Twenty cases (4.2%) were reclassified as adenocarcinoma, as they were positive for TTF-1 (8G7G3/1 or SPT24) with either no or focal p40 expression, and all of them were poorly differentiated with squamoid morphology. In addition, 1 case was reclassified as adenosquamous carcinoma, 4 cases as large cell carcinoma, 4 cases as large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, and 2 cases as small cell carcinoma. In poorly differentiated non-small cell lung carcinomas, an accurate distinction between squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma cannot be reliably determined by morphology alone and requires immunohistochemical analysis, even in resected specimens. Our findings suggest that TTF-1 8G7G3/1 may be better suited as the primary antibody in differentiating adenocarcinoma from squamous cell carcinoma.

Photoallergic reaction in a patient receiving vandetanib for metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma: a case report.,BMC dermatology,BMC Dermatol.,2015-02-13,"Novel targeted agents have been increasingly developed and tested in clinical trials over the past 5-10 years, many with unknown and unanticipated side effects. We describe here a case of a patient with a history of metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma that we believe developed vandetanib-associated photoallergic dermatitis while enrolled on a phase 1 clinical trial. A 51-year-old Caucasian female with poorly differentiated, metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma presented with a cutaneous eruption that developed over 3 to 4 days while treated on phase 1 clinical trial with vandetanib-based therapy. Given the concern for photoallergic dermatitis, vandetanib was discontinued and supportive care provided including topical and oral steroid administration.

"A phase 2 trial of lenvatinib (E7080) in advanced, progressive, radioiodine-refractory, differentiated thyroid cancer: A clinical outcomes and biomarker assessment.",Cancer,Cancer,2015-04-24,"Lenvatinib is an oral, multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 through 3 (VEGFR1-VEGFR3), fibroblast growth factor receptors 1 through 4 (FGFR1-FGFR4), platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα), ret proto-oncogene (RET), and v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KIT) signaling networks implicated in tumor angiogenesis. Positive phase 1 results in solid tumors prompted a phase 2 trial in patients with advanced, radioiodine-refractory, differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC). Fifty-eight patients with RR-DTC who had disease progression during the previous 12 months received lenvatinib 24 mg once daily in 28-day cycles until disease progression, unmanageable toxicity, withdrawal, or death. Previous VEGFR-targeted therapy was permitted. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) based on independent imaging review. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. Serum levels of 51 circulating cytokines and angiogenic factors also were assessed. After ≥14 months of follow-up, patients had an ORR of 50% (95% confidence interval [CI], 37%-63%) with only partial responses reported. The median time to response was 3.6 months, the median response duration was 12.7 months, and the median PFS was 12.6 months (95% CI, 9.9-16.1 months). The ORR for patients who had received previous VEGF therapy (n = 17) was 59% (95% CI, 33%-82%). Lower baseline levels of angiopoietin-2 were suggestive of tumor response and longer PFS. Grade 3 and 4 treatment-emergent adverse events, regardless of their relation to treatment, occurred in 72% of patients and most frequently included weight loss (12%), hypertension (10%), proteinuria (10%), and diarrhea (10%). In patients with and without prior exposure to VEGF therapy, the encouraging response rates, median time to response, and PFS for lenvatinib have prompted further investigation in a phase 3 trial.

Swinging for the Fences: Long-Term Survival With Ipilimumab in Metastatic Melanoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2015-05-11,"A 40-year-old man with stage III melanoma arising from his left shoulder underwent wide local excision, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and lymph node dissection. Nine months after receiving adjuvant biochemotherapy with cisplatin, vinblastine, dacarbazine, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and interferon alfa as part of a clinical trial, he developed headaches and right-hand weakness and was found to have a 2-cm left parietal CNS metastasis. A comprehensive staging workup identified multiple nonspecific subcentimeter pulmonary nodules. The brain mass was resected and confirmed to be metastatic melanoma; the surgical bed was treated with stereotactic radiosurgery. He was monitored off therapy, but 5 months later, he developed a second left parietal CNS metastasis and enlarging lung nodules. The new brain lesion was treated with stereotactic radiosurgery, and he began systemic therapy with ipilimumab on a clinical trial. After the third dose, he presented with headache, nausea, and vomiting; a brain magnetic resonance imaging scan showed left anterior temporal enhancement, possibly representing new disease. His symptoms improved with a course of corticosteroids. Restaging of the chest showed a mixed response among the pulmonary nodules. After tapering off corticosteroids, he received the fourth dose of ipilimumab, which was complicated by grade 3 transaminitis and hypophysitis with documented hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency. They were managed with corticosteroids and thyroid and adrenal hormone replacement. Restaging scans showed further disease regression except for new confluent enhancing nodules and edema in the left temporal lobe. Craniotomy and resection of this area showed only necrotic tissue with no viable melanoma cells. Nine years after treatment with ipilimumab, he is alive and shows no evidence of melanoma on the basis of annual computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain.

We retrospectively identified 151 patients diagnosed with a primary non-renal malignancy with renal metastasis. Clinical, radiographic and pathological characteristics were assessed. Overall survival (OS) was calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods. The median patient age was 56.7 years. The most common presenting symptoms were flank pain (30%), haematuria (16%) and weight loss (12%). Most primary cancers were carcinomas (80.8%). The most common primary tumour sites were lung (43.7%), colorectal (10.6%), head and neck (6%), breast (5.3%), soft tissue (5.3%) and thyroid (5.3%). Renal metastases were typically solitary (77.5%). Concordance between radiologist and clinician imaging assessment was 54.0%. Three ablations and 48 nephrectomies were performed. For non-surgical patients, renal metastasis diagnosis was made with fine-needle aspiration or biopsy.

Analysis of data from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results System and the National Center for Vital Statistics. Literature review of published English-language articles through December 31, 2013. The incidence of thyroid cancer has tripled over the past 30 years, whereas mortality is stable. The increase is mainly comprised of smaller tumors. These facts together suggest the major reason for the increased incidence is detection of subclinical, nonlethal disease. This has likely occurred through: health care system access, incidental detection on imaging, more frequent biopsy, greater volumes of and extent of surgery, and changes in pathology practices. Because larger-size tumors have increased in incidence also, it is possible that there is a concomitant true rise in thyroid cancer incidence. The only clearly identifiable contributor is radiation exposure, which has likely resulted in a few additional cases annually. The contribution of the following causes to the increasing incidence is unclear: iodine excess or insufficiency, diabetes and obesity, and molecular disruptions. The following mechanisms do not currently have strong evidence to support a link with the development of thyroid cancer: estrogen, dietary nitrate, and autoimmune thyroid disease. Research should focus on illuminating which thyroid cancers need treatment.

Detecting Germline PTEN Mutations Among At-Risk Patients With Cancer: An Age- and Sex-Specific Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2015-07-13,"Cowden syndrome (CS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by benign and malignant tumors. One-quarter of patients who are diagnosed with CS have pathogenic germline PTEN mutations, which increase the risk of the development of breast, thyroid, uterine, renal, and other cancers. PTEN testing and regular, intensive cancer surveillance allow for early detection and treatment of these cancers for mutation-positive patients and their relatives. Individual CS-related features, however, occur commonly in the general population, making it challenging for clinicians to identify CS-like patients to offer PTEN testing. We calculated the cost per mutation detected and analyzed the cost-effectiveness of performing selected PTEN testing among CS-like patients using a semi-quantitative score (the PTEN Cleveland Clinic [CC] score) compared with existing diagnostic criteria. In our model, first-degree relatives of the patients with detected PTEN mutations are offered PTEN testing. All individuals with detected PTEN mutations are offered cancer surveillance. CC score at a threshold of 15 (CC15) costs from $3,720 to $4,573 to detect one PTEN mutation, which is the most inexpensive among the different strategies. At base-case, CC10 is the most cost-effective strategy for female patients who are younger than 40 years, and CC15 is the most cost-effective strategy for female patients who are between 40 and 60 years of age and male patients of all ages. In sensitivity analyses, CC15 is robustly the most cost-effective strategy for probands who are younger than 60 years.

Cancer Res.,2015-07-13,"This ""3+3"" phase I study evaluated the safety, biologic, and clinical activity of lenvatinib, an oral multikinase inhibitor, in patients with solid tumors. Ascending doses of lenvatinib were administered per os twice daily in 28-day cycles. Safety and response were assessed for all patients. Angiogenic and apoptotic factors were tested as possible biomarkers in an expanded melanoma cohort. Seventy-seven patients were treated in 3 cohorts: 18 with intermittent twice-daily dosing (7 days on, 7 days off) of 0.1-3.2 mg; 33 with twice-daily dosing of 3.2-12 mg; and 26 with twice-daily dosing of 10 mg (expanded melanoma cohort). Maximum tolerated dose was established at 10 mg per os twice daily. Prominent drug-related toxicities included hypertension (43%), fatigue (42%), proteinuria (39%), and nausea (25%); dose-limiting toxicities included hypertension, fatigue, and proteinuria. Twelve patients (15.6%) achieved partial response (PR, n = 9) or unconfirmed PR (uPR, n = 3), and 19 (24.7%) achieved stable disease (SD) ≥23 weeks. Total PR/uPR/SD ≥23 weeks was 40.3% (n = 31). Responses (PR/uPR) by disease were as follows: melanoma, 5 of 29 patients (includes 1 patient with NRAS mutation); thyroid, 3 of 6 patients; pancreatic, 1 of 2 patients; lung, 1 of 1 patients; renal, 1 of 1 patients; endometrial, 1 of 4 patients; and ovarian, 1 of 5 patients. AUC(0-24) and C(max) increased dose proportionally. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard model analyses, increased baseline systolic blood pressure and decreased angiopoietin-1 ratio (2 hours:baseline) were associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS) in the expanded melanoma cohort (P = 0.041 and P = 0.03, respectively).

Interventions included total/near-total thyroidectomy (T/NTT), postoperative radioiodine (RAI), and thyroid hormone suppression therapy (THST). Main outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival using product limit and proportional hazards analyses. Improved OS was noted in NTCTCS stage III patients who received RAI (risk ratio [RR], 0.66; P = .04) and stage IV patients who received both T/NTT and RAI (RR, 0.66 and 0.70; combined P = .049). In all stages, moderate THST (TSH maintained subnormal-normal) was associated with significantly improved OS (RR stages I-IV: 0.13, 0.09, 0.13, 0.33) and disease-free survival (RR stages I-III: 0.52, 0.40, 0.18); no additional survival benefit was achieved with more aggressive THST (TSH maintained undetectable-subnormal). This remained true, even when distant metastatic disease was diagnosed during follow-up. Lower initial stage and moderate THST were independent predictors of improved OS during follow-up years 1-3. We confirm previous findings that T/NTT followed by RAI is associated with benefit in high-risk patients, but not in low-risk patients. In contrast with earlier reports, moderate THST is associated with better outcomes across all stages, and aggressive THST may not be warranted even in patients diagnosed with distant metastatic disease during follow-up. Moderate THST continued at least 3 years after diagnosis may be indicated in high-risk patients.",Journal Article,1652.0,52.0,Initial treatments for patients with differentiated cancer are supported primarily by single-institution retrospective studies with limited follow-up and low event rates We report updated analyses of long-term outcomes after treatment in patients with differentiated cancer The objective was to examine effects of initial therapies on outcomes This was a prospective multi-institutional registry A total of 4941 patients median follow-up 6 years participated Interventions included total/near-total thyroidectomy T/NTT postoperative radioiodine RAI and hormone suppression therapy THST Main outcome measures were overall survival OS and disease-free survival using product limit and proportional hazards analyses Improved OS was noted in NTCTCS stage III patients who received RAI risk ratio RR 0.66 P .04 and stage IV patients who received both T/NTT and RAI RR 0.66 and 0.70 combined P .049 In all stages moderate THST TSH maintained subnormal-normal was associated with significantly improved OS RR stages I-IV 0.13 0.09 0.13 0.33 and disease-free survival RR stages I-III 0.52 0.40 0.18 no additional survival benefit was achieved with more aggressive THST TSH maintained undetectable-subnormal This remained true even when distant metastatic disease was diagnosed during follow-up Lower initial stage and moderate THST were independent predictors of improved OS during follow-up years 1-3 We confirm previous findings that T/NTT followed by RAI is associated with benefit in high-risk patients but not in low-risk patients In contrast with earlier reports moderate THST is associated with better outcomes across all stages and aggressive THST may not be warranted even in patients diagnosed with distant metastatic disease during follow-up Moderate THST continued at least 3 years after diagnosis may be indicated in high-risk patients,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[388, 640, 9, 7, 5, 1442, 12, 32, 2708, 1561, 20, 226, 731, 459, 94, 5, 383, 166, 126, 2, 154, 774, 151, 21, 414, 2939, 318, 1, 319, 337, 123, 50, 24, 4, 7, 5, 1442, 12, 3, 461, 10, 6, 1004, 176, 1, 388, 235, 23, 123, 26, 10, 8, 482, 1414, 1115, 1608, 8, 181, 1, 49184, 7, 52, 166, 126, 49, 60, 3025, 1151, 159, 181, 1829, 181, 5949, 102, 26868, 573, 7211, 4121, 2, 785, 1332, 36, 27461, 1895, 228, 1018, 11, 63, 25, 118, 2, 34, 115, 25, 75, 2821, 2385, 2, 831, 1017, 318, 231, 118, 10, 1051, 4, 36062, 82, 316, 7, 54, 103, 4121, 43, 197, 861, 13, 700, 19, 755, 2, 82, 478, 7, 54, 103, 110, 102, 26868, 2, 4121, 861, 13, 700, 2, 13, 431, 397, 19, 5121, 4, 62, 1153, 1163, 27461, 6581, 1955, 33657, 295, 10, 41, 5, 97, 231, 118, 861, 1153, 70, 478, 13, 233, 13, 1730, 13, 233, 13, 466, 2, 34, 115, 25, 861, 1153, 70, 316, 13, 653, 13, 327, 13, 203, 77, 402, 25, 247, 10, 513, 5, 80, 571, 27461, 6581, 1955, 3920, 33657, 26, 958, 2501, 871, 198, 626, 113, 34, 10, 265, 190, 166, 126, 280, 388, 82, 2, 1163, 27461, 11, 306, 674, 1, 231, 118, 190, 166, 126, 60, 14, 27, 21, 1843, 698, 272, 17, 102, 26868, 370, 20, 4121, 16, 41, 5, 247, 4, 64, 43, 7, 84, 44, 4, 154, 43, 7, 4, 748, 5, 1677, 1198, 1163, 27461, 16, 41, 5, 380, 123, 716, 62, 1153, 2, 571, 27461, 68, 44, 40, 1197, 871, 4, 7, 265, 5, 626, 113, 34, 190, 166, 126, 1163, 27461, 1351, 28, 506, 27, 60, 50, 147, 68, 40, 1103, 4, 64, 43, 7]",1840.0,26171797,571
Melanocytic nevi excised during B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) inhibitor therapy: A study of 19 lesions from 10 patients.,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,J. Am. Acad. Dermatol.,2015-07-16,"There are limited descriptions of histopathology and immune profiles of new or changing melanocytic nevi in the setting of B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) inhibitor therapy. We sought to identify their distinctive features. Clinical charts and histologic review, neuroblastoma RAS viral (v-ras) oncogene homolog genotyping, and immunohistochemistry for HMB-45, BRAFV600E, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK), phosphorylated protein kinase B, CD4, and CD8 were performed on 19 melanocytic nevi from 10 patients and 23 control nevi. BRAF inhibitors were administered for metastatic melanoma (7), colonic adenocarcinoma (2), and papillary thyroid carcinoma (1). The average duration of BRAF inhibition before lesion excision was 8 months. Frequently associated histologic features included pigmentation of the stratum corneum, hyperpigmented keratinocytes, dermal melanophages, and deep HMB-45 expression. The lesions were BRAFV600E and neuroblastoma RAS viral (v-ras) oncogene homolog wild-type, expressed diffuse weak-moderate pERK, and possessed a predominance of CD8(+) in comparison with CD4(+) T lymphocytes within the dermal infiltrates. This is a retrospective study of a small and heterogeneous group. The nevi associated with BRAF inhibitor therapy invariably lack BRAFV600E mutation. BRAF inhibition appears to cause an increased cytotoxic T-cell response and increased mitogen-activated protein kinase activity in BRAF wild-type lesions, supported by pERK expression, possibly resulting in an activated phenotype characterized by increased melanin pigmentation and deep HMB-45 expression.",Comparative Study,1650.0,5.0,There are limited descriptions of histopathology and immune profiles of new or changing melanocytic nevi in the setting of B-Raf proto-oncogene BRAF inhibitor therapy We sought to identify their distinctive features Clinical charts and histologic review RAS viral v-ras oncogene homolog genotyping and immunohistochemistry for HMB-45 BRAFV600E phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase pERK phosphorylated protein kinase B CD4 and CD8 were performed on 19 melanocytic nevi from 10 patients and 23 control nevi BRAF inhibitors were administered for metastatic 7 colonic adenocarcinoma 2 and papillary carcinoma 1 The average duration of BRAF inhibition before lesion excision was 8 months Frequently associated histologic features included pigmentation of the stratum corneum hyperpigmented keratinocytes dermal melanophages and deep HMB-45 expression The lesions were BRAFV600E and RAS viral v-ras oncogene homolog wild-type expressed diffuse weak-moderate pERK and possessed a predominance of CD8 in comparison with CD4 T lymphocytes within the dermal infiltrates This is a retrospective study of a small and heterogeneous group The nevi associated with BRAF inhibitor therapy invariably lack BRAFV600E mutation BRAF inhibition appears to cause an increased cytotoxic T-cell response and increased mitogen-activated protein kinase activity in BRAF wild-type lesions supported by pERK expression possibly resulting in an activated phenotype characterized by increased melanin pigmentation and deep HMB-45 expression,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[125, 32, 383, 11798, 1, 3831, 2, 250, 1241, 1, 217, 15, 3600, 6123, 5791, 4, 3, 546, 1, 132, 2212, 4976, 1836, 566, 230, 36, 21, 990, 6, 255, 136, 5049, 404, 38, 4413, 2, 884, 206, 1102, 1667, 603, 1102, 1836, 3412, 2686, 2, 888, 9, 16740, 512, 9315, 2365, 1976, 1235, 1065, 216, 6621, 2365, 178, 216, 132, 1440, 2, 968, 11, 173, 23, 326, 6123, 5791, 29, 79, 7, 2, 382, 182, 5791, 566, 222, 11, 468, 9, 113, 67, 3663, 449, 18, 2, 1796, 134, 14, 3, 1011, 654, 1, 566, 297, 348, 1180, 1366, 10, 66, 53, 746, 41, 884, 404, 159, 16235, 1, 3, 4897, 42807, 40046, 9587, 6132, 66507, 2, 2369, 16740, 512, 55, 3, 406, 11, 9315, 2, 1102, 1667, 603, 1102, 1836, 3412, 955, 267, 570, 1388, 4241, 1163, 6621, 2, 10966, 8, 7593, 1, 968, 4, 1155, 5, 1440, 102, 1594, 262, 3, 6132, 5942, 26, 16, 8, 459, 45, 1, 8, 302, 2, 1564, 87, 3, 5791, 41, 5, 566, 230, 36, 6912, 926, 9315, 258, 566, 297, 1233, 6, 708, 35, 101, 759, 102, 31, 51, 2, 101, 2625, 735, 178, 216, 128, 4, 566, 955, 267, 406, 2708, 20, 6621, 55, 2150, 1113, 4, 35, 735, 1005, 765, 20, 101, 14616, 16235, 2, 2369, 16740, 512, 55]",1526.0,26190239,113
"Efficacy of the Natural Clay, Calcium Aluminosilicate Anti-Diarrheal, in Reducing Medullary Thyroid Cancer-Related Diarrhea and Its Effects on Quality of Life: A Pilot Study.",Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2015-08-20,"Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC)-related diarrhea can be debilitating, reduces quality of life (QOL), and may be the only indication for initiating systemic therapy. Conventional antidiarrheal drugs are not always helpful and may have side effects. Calcium aluminosilicate antidiarrheal (CASAD), a natural calcium montmorrilonite clay, safely adsorbs toxins and inflammatory proteins associated with diarrhea. It was hypothesized that CASAD would reduce the severity of diarrhea and improve QOL in MTC patients. This was a prospective pilot trial (NCT01739634) of MTC patients not on systemic therapy with self-reported diarrhea of three or more bowel movements (BMs) per day for a week or more. The study design included a one-week run-in period followed by one week of CASAD ± a two-week optional continuation period. The primary endpoint was efficacy of one week of CASAD treatment in decreasing the number of BMs per day by ≥20% when compared with the baseline run-in period. Secondary objectives included tolerability and safety and the impact on QOL using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Thyroid questionnaire (MDASI-THY). Ten MTC patients (median age = 52 years, 70% female, 80% white) were enrolled. All had distant metastases, and median calcitonin was 5088 ng/mL (range 1817-42,007 ng/mL). Ninety percent had received prior antidiarrheals, and 40% of these had used two or more drugs, including tincture of opium (30%), loperamide (50%), diphenoxylate/atropine (20%), colestipol (10%), or cholestyramine (10%). Of seven evaluable patients, four (56%) had ≥20% reduction in BMs per day. Six out of seven patients discontinued their prior antidiarrheals. Best response ranged from 7% to 99% reduction in mean BMs/day from baseline. Five out of seven patients considered CASAD a success, and they opted for the two-week continuation period. Improvements in diarrhea and all six interference items assessed by MDASI-THY were noted at weeks 1 and 3. Total interference score was significantly improved at three weeks compared with baseline (p = 0.05). An oral levothyroxine absorption test was performed in one patient; malabsorption of levothyroxine was not observed. Adverse events included flatulence (40%), bloating (10%), heartburn (10%), and constipation (10%). CASAD is a promising strategy for treatment of MTC-related diarrhea. In this small pilot study, improvements in frequency and quality of diarrhea as well as QOL were noted.

"Reassessing the NTCTCS Staging Systems for Differentiated Thyroid Cancer, Including Age at Diagnosis.",Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2015-08-24,"Thyroid cancer is unique for having age as a staging variable. Recently, the commonly used age cut-point of 45 years has been questioned. This study assessed alternate staging systems on the outcome of overall survival, and compared these with current National Thyroid Cancer Treatment Cooperative Study (NTCTCS) staging systems for papillary and follicular thyroid cancer. A total of 4721 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer were assessed. Five potential alternate staging systems were generated at age cut-points in five-year increments from 35 to 70 years, and tested for model discrimination (Harrell's C-statistic) and calibration (R(2)). The best five models for papillary and follicular cancer were further tested with bootstrap resampling and significance testing for discrimination. The best five alternate papillary cancer systems had age cut-points of 45-50 years, with the highest scoring model using 50 years. No significant difference in C-statistic was found between the best alternate and current NTCTCS systems (p = 0.200). The best five alternate follicular cancer systems had age cut-points of 50-55 years, with the highest scoring model using 50 years. All five best alternate staging systems performed better compared with the current system (p = 0.003-0.035).

Defining a Valid Age Cutoff in Staging of Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2015-07-28,"Age 45 years is used as a cutoff in the staging of well-differentiated thyroid cancer (WDTC) as it represents the median age of most datasets. The aim of this study was to determine a statistically optimized age threshold using a large dataset of patients treated at a comprehensive cancer center. Overall, 1807 patients with a median follow-up of 109 months were included in the study. Recursive partitioning was used to determine which American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) variables were most predictive of disease-specific death, and whether a different cutoff for age would be found. From the resulting tree, a new age cutoff was picked and patients were restaged using this new cutoff. The 10-year disease-specific survival (DSS) by Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) stage was 99.6, 100, 96, and 81 % for stages I-IV, respectively. Using recursive partitioning, the presence of distant metastasis was the most powerful predictor of DSS. For M0 patients, age was the next most powerful predictor, with a cutoff of 56 years. For M1 patients, a cutoff at 54 years was most predictive. Having reviewed the analysis, age 55 years was selected as a more robust age cutoff than 45 years. The 10-year DSS by new stage (using age 55 years as the cutoff) was 99.2, 98, 100, and 74 % for stages I-IV, respectively. A change in age cutoff in the AJCC/UICC staging for WDTC to 55 years would improve the accuracy of the system and appropriately prevent low-risk patients being overstaged and overtreated.",Journal Article,1638.0,41.0,Age 45 years is used as a cutoff in the staging of well-differentiated cancer WDTC as it represents the median age of most datasets The aim of this study was to determine a statistically optimized age threshold using a large dataset of patients treated at a comprehensive cancer center Overall 1807 patients with a median follow-up of 109 months were included in the study Recursive partitioning was used to determine which American Joint Committee on Cancer AJCC variables were most predictive of disease-specific death and whether a different cutoff for age would be found From the resulting tree a new age cutoff was picked and patients were restaged using this new cutoff The 10-year disease-specific survival DSS by Union for International Cancer Control AJCC/UICC stage was 99.6 100 96 and 81 for stages I-IV respectively Using recursive partitioning the presence of distant metastasis was the most powerful predictor of DSS For M0 patients age was the next most powerful predictor with a cutoff of 56 years For M1 patients a cutoff at 54 years was most predictive Having reviewed the analysis age 55 years was selected as a more robust age cutoff than 45 years The 10-year DSS by new stage using age 55 years as the cutoff was 99.2 98 100 and 74 for stages I-IV respectively A change in age cutoff in the AJCC/UICC staging for WDTC to 55 years would improve the accuracy of the system and appropriately prevent low-risk patients being overstaged and overtreated,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[89, 512, 60, 16, 95, 22, 8, 2779, 4, 3, 632, 1, 149, 1442, 12, 14663, 22, 192, 1449, 3, 52, 89, 1, 96, 3455, 3, 1130, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 223, 8, 712, 4039, 89, 2390, 75, 8, 375, 3014, 1, 7, 73, 28, 8, 949, 12, 574, 63, 66580, 7, 5, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 3486, 53, 11, 159, 4, 3, 45, 4493, 4515, 10, 95, 6, 223, 92, 597, 2093, 2002, 23, 12, 2271, 682, 11, 96, 464, 1, 34, 112, 273, 2, 317, 8, 338, 2779, 9, 89, 688, 40, 204, 29, 3, 1113, 4899, 8, 217, 89, 2779, 10, 28724, 2, 7, 11, 15090, 75, 26, 217, 2779, 3, 79, 111, 34, 112, 25, 1788, 20, 7863, 9, 944, 12, 182, 2271, 8467, 82, 10, 1058, 49, 394, 921, 2, 865, 9, 1153, 70, 478, 106, 75, 4493, 4515, 3, 463, 1, 626, 278, 10, 3, 96, 3757, 980, 1, 1788, 9, 4591, 7, 89, 10, 3, 1305, 96, 3757, 980, 5, 8, 2779, 1, 664, 60, 9, 4445, 7, 8, 2779, 28, 667, 60, 10, 96, 464, 1041, 446, 3, 65, 89, 614, 60, 10, 715, 22, 8, 80, 1922, 89, 2779, 76, 512, 60, 3, 79, 111, 1788, 20, 217, 82, 75, 89, 614, 60, 22, 3, 2779, 10, 1058, 18, 1096, 394, 2, 794, 9, 1153, 70, 478, 106, 8, 707, 4, 89, 2779, 4, 3, 2271, 8467, 632, 9, 14663, 6, 614, 60, 688, 401, 3, 1190, 1, 3, 398, 2, 4544, 1682, 154, 43, 7, 486, 28668, 2, 18460]",1468.0,26215199,130
Risk of Subsequent Neoplasms During the Fifth and Sixth Decades of Life in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study Cohort.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2015-08-10,"Survivors of childhood cancer have an increased risk for subsequent neoplasms (SNs), but the incidence beyond the age of 40 years and associations with therapeutic exposures have not been well described. Among 14,364 survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed between 1970 and 1986, 3,171 had an attained age of 40 years or older at the time of last contact. Cumulative incidence of SNs, standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), excess absolute risk of subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs), and relative risks (RRs) for SMNs and nonmelanoma skin cancers were calculated. In total, 679 SNs were diagnosed in patients age 40 years or older. These included 196 SMNs, 419 nonmelanoma skin cancers, 21 nonmalignant meningiomas, and 43 other benign neoplasms. At age 55 years, the cumulative incidence of new SNs and SMNs occurring after age 40 years was 34.6% (95% CI, 28.7 to 40.6) and 16.3% (95% CI, 11.7 to 20.9), respectively. Survivors were twice as likely as the general population to receive a diagnosis of SMN after age 40 years (SIR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.9 to 2.5). Among SMNs, risk was increased for breast cancer (SIR, 5.5; 95% CI, 4.5 to 6.7), renal cancer (SIR, 3.9; 95% CI, 2.0 to 7.5), soft tissue sarcoma (SIR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5 to 4.4), and thyroid cancer (SIR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0 to 3.5).

Palliative head and neck radiotherapy with the RTOG 8502 regimen for incurable primary or metastatic cancers.,Oral oncology,Oral Oncol.,2015-08-14,"To report on our institutional experience of palliative radiotherapy (RT) of cancers in the head and neck by the RTOG 8502 'QUAD SHOT' regimen. Seventy-five patients completed at least 1 cycle of palliative RT to the head and neck for primary or metastatic disease based on the RTOG 8502 regimen (3.7 Gy twice daily over 2 consecutive days at 4 week intervals per cycle) between 2/2005 and 7/2014. Median patient age was 76 years (range 23-97). The most common histologies were squamous cell carcinoma (55%), non-anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (10%) and salivary gland carcinoma (9%). Thirty patients (40%) received prior RT at the palliative site. Twenty-eight patients (37%) completed at least three RTOG 8502 cycles. Sixty-five percent of all patients had a palliative response. Median overall survival was 5.67 months (range, 0.20-34.5). Grade 3 toxicity in 4 patients (5%) consisted of acute dermatitis and functional mucositis. Palliative response was significantly correlated with increasing number of RTOG 8502 cycles (p = 0.012), but not KPS, prior RT, palliative chemotherapy, prior surgery, histology or stage.

Cancer Signature Investigation: ERBB2 (HER2)-Activating Mutation and Amplification-Positive Breast Carcinoma Mimicking Lung Primary.,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,2015-08-01,"Next-generation sequencing of primary and metachronous metastatic cancer lesions may impact patient care. We present a case of relapsed metastatic breast cancer with a dominant pulmonary lesion originally identified as lung adenocarcinoma. A 72-year-old, never-smoker woman with a protracted cough was found to have a large lung mass and regional lymphadenopathy on a chest CT. Lung mass biopsy showed adenocarcinoma with focal TTF-1 (thyroid transcription factor 1) positivity, favoring a lung primary. In addition to stereotactic brain radiation for cerebral metastases, she was started on carboplatin/pemetrexed. As part of the workup, the tumor was analyzed by a 50-gene targeted mutation panel, which detected 3 somatic mutations: ERBB2 (HER2) D769H activating missense mutation, TP53 Y126 inactivating truncating mutation, and SMARCB1 R374Q missense mutation. Of note, the patient had a history of stage IIA triple-negative grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast 1.5 years ago and received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant radiation, and underwent a lumpectomy. Further analysis of her primary breast tumor showed a mutational profile identical to that of the lung tumor. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed HER2 amplification in the lung tumor, with a HER2/CEP17 ratio of 3.9. The patient was diagnosed with recurrent HER2-positive metastatic breast carcinoma with a coexisting ERBB2 (HER2) activating mutation. Chemotherapy was adjusted to include dual HER2-targeted therapy containing trastuzumab and pertuzumab, resulting in an ongoing partial response. This case demonstrates that a unique genetic mutational profile can clarify whether a tumor represents a metastatic lesion or new malignancy when conventional morphological and immunohistochemical methods are indeterminate, and can directly impact treatment decisions.

Vemurafenib in Multiple Nonmelanoma Cancers with BRAF V600 Mutations.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2015-08-01,"BRAF V600 mutations occur in various nonmelanoma cancers. We undertook a histology-independent phase 2 ""basket"" study of vemurafenib in BRAF V600 mutation-positive nonmelanoma cancers. We enrolled patients in six prespecified cancer cohorts; patients with all other tumor types were enrolled in a seventh cohort. A total of 122 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive cancer were treated, including 27 patients with colorectal cancer who received vemurafenib and cetuximab. The primary end point was the response rate; secondary end points included progression-free and overall survival. In the cohort with non-small-cell lung cancer, the response rate was 42% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20 to 67) and median progression-free survival was 7.3 months (95% CI, 3.5 to 10.8). In the cohort with Erdheim-Chester disease or Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis, the response rate was 43% (95% CI, 18 to 71); the median treatment duration was 5.9 months (range, 0.6 to 18.6), and no patients had disease progression during therapy. There were anecdotal responses among patients with pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, anaplastic thyroid cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, salivary-duct cancer, ovarian cancer, and clear-cell sarcoma and among patients with colorectal cancer who received vemurafenib and cetuximab. Safety was similar to that in prior studies of vemurafenib for melanoma. BRAF V600 appears to be a targetable oncogene in some, but not all, nonmelanoma cancers. Preliminary vemurafenib activity was observed in non-small-cell lung cancer and in Erdheim-Chester disease and Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis.

Disease control rate (DCR) was 80% (95% CI, 67%-89%); 44% had stable disease. Among responders, median time to response (TTR) was 3.5 months (95% CI, 1.9-3.7). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 9.0 months (95% CI, 7.0-not evaluable). Common toxicity criteria grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events included diarrhea (14%), hypertension (7%), decreased appetite (7%), fatigue, dysphagia, and increased alanine aminotransferase levels (5% each). Ret proto-oncogene status did not correlate with outcomes. Low baseline levels of angiopoietin-2, hepatocyte growth factor, and IL8 were associated with tumor reduction and prolonged PFS. High baseline levels of VEGF, soluble VEGFR3, and platelet-derived growth factor BB, and low baseline levels of soluble Tie-2, were associated with tumor reduction. Lenvatinib had a high ORR, high DCR, and a short TTR in patients with documented progressive MTC.

Safety and tolerability of sorafenib in patients with radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancer.,Endocrine-related cancer,Endocr. Relat. Cancer,2015-12-01,"Effective adverse event (AE) management is critical to maintaining patients on anticancer therapies. The DECISION trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 trial which investigated sorafenib for treatment of progressive, advanced, or metastatic radioactive iodine-refractory, differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Four hundred and seventeen adult patients were randomized (1:1) to receive oral sorafenib (400 mg, twice daily) or placebo, until progression, unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance, or withdrawal. Progression-free survival, the primary endpoint of DECISION, was reported previously. To elucidate the patterns and management of AEs in sorafenib-treated patients in the DECISION trial, this report describes detailed, by-treatment-cycle analyses of the incidence, prevalence, and severity of hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR), rash/desquamation, hypertension, diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, increased serum thyroid stimulating hormone, and hypocalcemia, as well as the interventions used to manage these AEs. By-cycle incidence of the above-selected AEs with sorafenib was generally highest in cycle 1 or 2 then decreased. AE prevalence generally increased over cycles 2-6 then stabilized or declined. Among these AEs, only weight loss tended to increase in severity (from grade 1 to 2) over time; severity of HFSR and rash/desquamation declined over time. AEs were mostly grade 1 or 2, and were generally managed with dose interruptions/reductions, and concomitant medications (e.g. antidiarrheals, antihypertensives, dermatologic preparations). Most dose interruptions/reductions occurred in early cycles. In conclusion, AEs with sorafenib in DECISION were typically grade 1 or 2, occurred early during the treatment course, and were manageable over time.","Clinical Trial, Phase III",1512.0,23.0,Effective adverse event AE management is critical to maintaining patients on anticancer therapies The DECISION trial was a multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial which investigated sorafenib for treatment of progressive advanced or metastatic radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated carcinoma Four hundred and seventeen adult patients were randomized 1:1 to receive oral sorafenib 400 mg twice daily or placebo until progression unacceptable toxicity noncompliance or withdrawal Progression-free survival the primary endpoint of DECISION was reported previously To elucidate the patterns and management of AEs in sorafenib-treated patients in the DECISION trial this report describes detailed by-treatment-cycle analyses of the incidence prevalence and severity of hand-foot reaction HFSR rash/desquamation hypertension diarrhea fatigue weight loss increased serum stimulating hormone and hypocalcemia as well as the interventions used to manage these AEs By-cycle incidence of the above-selected AEs with sorafenib was generally highest in cycle 1 or 2 then decreased AE prevalence generally increased over cycles 2-6 then stabilized or declined Among these AEs only weight loss tended to increase in severity from grade 1 to 2 over time severity of HFSR and rash/desquamation declined over time AEs were mostly grade 1 or 2 and were generally managed with dose interruptions/reductions and concomitant medications e.g antidiarrheals antihypertensives dermatologic preparations Most dose interruptions/reductions occurred in early cycles In conclusion AEs with sorafenib in DECISION were typically grade 1 or 2 occurred early during the treatment course and were manageable over time,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[323, 290, 774, 3633, 284, 16, 740, 6, 3284, 7, 23, 1475, 235, 3, 948, 160, 10, 8, 1570, 384, 1627, 3142, 619, 1149, 124, 27, 160, 92, 565, 1034, 9, 24, 1, 1014, 131, 15, 113, 4741, 4287, 430, 1442, 134, 294, 1128, 2, 3591, 780, 7, 11, 384, 14, 14, 6, 560, 518, 1034, 1524, 81, 936, 391, 15, 619, 1100, 91, 3215, 155, 13494, 15, 3683, 91, 115, 25, 3, 86, 1138, 1, 948, 10, 210, 373, 6, 3061, 3, 764, 2, 284, 1, 1477, 4, 1034, 73, 7, 4, 3, 948, 160, 26, 414, 2677, 2455, 20, 24, 417, 318, 1, 3, 287, 1078, 2, 1702, 1, 2833, 4100, 1329, 10362, 1641, 11320, 1824, 1172, 613, 924, 407, 101, 524, 2122, 785, 2, 15456, 22, 149, 22, 3, 1151, 95, 6, 4001, 46, 1477, 20, 417, 287, 1, 3, 2090, 715, 1477, 5, 1034, 10, 1228, 1076, 4, 417, 14, 15, 18, 818, 340, 3633, 1078, 1228, 101, 252, 410, 18, 49, 818, 7368, 15, 3054, 107, 46, 1477, 158, 924, 407, 3886, 6, 344, 4, 1702, 29, 88, 14, 6, 18, 252, 98, 1702, 1, 10362, 2, 1641, 11320, 3054, 252, 98, 1477, 11, 2754, 88, 14, 15, 18, 2, 11, 1228, 2231, 5, 61, 7406, 2153, 2, 1781, 2679, 563, 499, 41158, 28771, 4722, 7791, 96, 61, 7406, 2153, 489, 4, 191, 410, 4, 1221, 1477, 5, 1034, 4, 948, 11, 1969, 88, 14, 15, 18, 489, 191, 190, 3, 24, 906, 2, 11, 2808, 252, 98]",1719.0,26370187,456
Acute Tumor Lactate Perturbations as a Biomarker of Genotoxic Stress: Development of a Biochemical Model.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2015-09-16,"Ionizing radiation is the primary nonsurgical treatment modality for solid tumors. Its effectiveness is impacted by temporal constraints such as fractionation, hypoxia, and development of radioresistant clones. Biomarkers of acute radiation response are essential to developing more effective clinical algorithms. We hypothesized that acute perturbations in tumor lactate levels act as a surrogate marker of radiation response. In vitro experiments were carried out using validated human-derived cell lines from three histologies: anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Cellular metabolic activity was measured using standard biochemical assays. In vivo validation was performed using both an orthotopic and a flank derivative of a previously established ATC xenograft murine model. Irradiation of cells and tumors triggered a rapid, dose-dependent, transient decrease in lactate levels that was reversed by free radical scavengers. Acute lactate perturbations following irradiation could identify hypoxic conditions and correlated with hypoxia-induced radioresistance. Mutant TP53 cells and cells in which p53 activity was abrogated (shRNA) demonstrated a blunted lactate response to irradiation, consistent with a radioresistant phenotype. Lactate measurements therefore rapidly detected both induced (i.e., hypoxia) and intrinsic (i.e., mutTP53-driven) radioresistance. We conclude that lactate is a quantitative biomarker of acute genotoxic stress, with a temporal resolution that can inform clinical decision making. Combined with the spatial resolution of newly developed metabolic imaging platforms, this biomarker could lead to the development of truly individualized treatment strategies.",Journal Article,1588.0,7.0,Ionizing radiation is the primary nonsurgical treatment modality for solid tumors Its effectiveness is impacted by temporal constraints such as fractionation hypoxia and development of radioresistant clones Biomarkers of acute radiation response are essential to developing more effective clinical algorithms We hypothesized that acute perturbations in tumor lactate levels act as a surrogate marker of radiation response In vitro experiments were carried out using validated human-derived cell lines from three histologies anaplastic carcinoma ATC head and squamous cell carcinoma HNSCC and papillary carcinoma PTC Cellular metabolic activity was measured using standard biochemical assays In vivo validation was performed using both an orthotopic and a flank derivative of a previously established ATC xenograft murine model Irradiation of cells and tumors triggered a rapid dose-dependent transient decrease in lactate levels that was reversed by free radical scavengers Acute lactate perturbations following irradiation could identify hypoxic conditions and correlated with hypoxia-induced radioresistance Mutant TP53 cells and cells in which p53 activity was abrogated shRNA demonstrated a blunted lactate response to irradiation consistent with a radioresistant phenotype Lactate measurements therefore rapidly detected both induced i.e. hypoxia and intrinsic i.e. mutTP53-driven radioresistance We conclude that lactate is a quantitative biomarker of acute genotoxic stress with a temporal resolution that can inform clinical decision making Combined with the spatial resolution of newly developed metabolic imaging platforms this biomarker could lead to the development of truly individualized treatment strategies,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[4341, 121, 16, 3, 86, 5544, 24, 1396, 9, 537, 57, 211, 1236, 16, 4619, 20, 3264, 4879, 225, 22, 3519, 1823, 2, 193, 1, 7092, 2749, 582, 1, 286, 121, 51, 32, 1452, 6, 931, 80, 323, 38, 3529, 21, 1237, 17, 286, 7013, 4, 30, 3330, 148, 2559, 22, 8, 2592, 952, 1, 121, 51, 4, 439, 2332, 11, 2629, 1205, 75, 938, 171, 526, 31, 285, 29, 169, 3489, 1841, 134, 3871, 718, 2, 691, 31, 134, 1209, 2, 1796, 134, 3748, 763, 1436, 128, 10, 644, 75, 260, 1487, 1013, 4, 386, 929, 10, 173, 75, 110, 35, 2157, 2, 8, 5564, 4819, 1, 8, 373, 635, 3871, 1330, 1471, 202, 1104, 1, 37, 2, 57, 4173, 8, 1321, 61, 470, 2473, 775, 4, 3330, 148, 17, 10, 3682, 20, 115, 711, 26237, 286, 3330, 7013, 366, 1104, 359, 255, 4744, 1298, 2, 438, 5, 1823, 277, 7052, 620, 1206, 37, 2, 37, 4, 92, 624, 128, 10, 3728, 3976, 264, 8, 14113, 3330, 51, 6, 1104, 925, 5, 8, 7092, 1005, 3330, 1685, 673, 1755, 530, 110, 277, 70, 563, 1823, 2, 2354, 70, 563, 35146, 1621, 7052, 21, 2060, 17, 3330, 16, 8, 1156, 901, 1, 286, 7876, 1531, 5, 8, 3264, 2125, 17, 122, 2295, 38, 948, 1079, 397, 5, 3, 5104, 2125, 1, 732, 276, 1436, 270, 4364, 26, 901, 359, 1122, 6, 3, 193, 1, 7260, 2596, 24, 422]",1722.0,26376962,441
Increased risk of second malignant neoplasms in adolescents and young adults with cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2015-10-06,"The authors describe the incidence and characteristics of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMNs) in adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors compared with those in younger and older cancer survivors. Children aged ≤ 14 years, AYAs aged 15 to 39, and older adults aged ≥ 40 years at the time of primary diagnosis who were reported as cancer survivors in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program between 1973 and 2011 were compared in this population-based analysis. The primary analysis was the risk that an SMN would occur ≥ 5 years after the original diagnosis for patients who had the more common AYA cancers (leukemia, lymphoma, testicular malignancy, ovarian malignancy, melanoma, and cancers of the thyroid, breast, soft tissue, or bone). The standardized incidence ratio (SIR), absolute excess risk (AER), and cumulative incidence of SMN for the selected cancers were assessed. The risk of SMN for the entire cohort also was analyzed. Of the 148,558 AYA survivors who were diagnosed with a selected cancer, 7384 developed an SMN 5 years after their original diagnosis. The SIRs (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were 1.58 (95% CI, 1.55-1.62) for AYAs, 4.26 (95% CI, 3.77-4.80) for children, and 1.10 (95% CI, 1.09-1.11) for older adults, and the AERs were 22.9, 16.6, and 14.7, respectively.

2015 American Thyroid Association Management Guidelines for Adult Patients with Thyroid Nodules and Differentiated Thyroid Cancer: The American Thyroid Association Guidelines Task Force on Thyroid Nodules and Differentiated Thyroid Cancer.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2016-01-01,"Thyroid nodules are a common clinical problem, and differentiated thyroid cancer is becoming increasingly prevalent. Since the American Thyroid Association's (ATA's) guidelines for the management of these disorders were revised in 2009, significant scientific advances have occurred in the field. The aim of these guidelines is to inform clinicians, patients, researchers, and health policy makers on published evidence relating to the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer. The specific clinical questions addressed in these guidelines were based on prior versions of the guidelines, stakeholder input, and input of task force members. Task force panel members were educated on knowledge synthesis methods, including electronic database searching, review and selection of relevant citations, and critical appraisal of selected studies. Published English language articles on adults were eligible for inclusion. The American College of Physicians Guideline Grading System was used for critical appraisal of evidence and grading strength of recommendations for therapeutic interventions. We developed a similarly formatted system to appraise the quality of such studies and resultant recommendations. The guideline panel had complete editorial independence from the ATA. Competing interests of guideline task force members were regularly updated, managed, and communicated to the ATA and task force members. The revised guidelines for the management of thyroid nodules include recommendations regarding initial evaluation, clinical and ultrasound criteria for fine-needle aspiration biopsy, interpretation of fine-needle aspiration biopsy results, use of molecular markers, and management of benign thyroid nodules. Recommendations regarding the initial management of thyroid cancer include those relating to screening for thyroid cancer, staging and risk assessment, surgical management, radioiodine remnant ablation and therapy, and thyrotropin suppression therapy using levothyroxine. Recommendations related to long-term management of differentiated thyroid cancer include those related to surveillance for recurrent disease using imaging and serum thyroglobulin, thyroid hormone therapy, management of recurrent and metastatic disease, consideration for clinical trials and targeted therapy, as well as directions for future research.

No prior study has been reported that simultaneously targets the 3 principal cell cycle phases populated by proliferating cells--G1, S, and G2/M. Temsirolimus (G1 inhibitor), topotecan (S inhibitor), and bortezomib (G2/M inhibitor) were administered in combination to patients with advanced malignancies using a 3+3 dose escalation schedule to assess the safety and establish the maximum tolerated dose (primary endpoints) of this cell cycle targeting approach. An in silico pharmacodynamic model using established effects of each of these agents on the cell cycle was used to validate the regimen and to guide the dosing regimen. Sixty-two subjects were enrolled. The most common adverse events and dose-limiting toxicities were cytopenias, consistent with the cell cycle targeting approach employed. All cytopenias resolved to baseline values upon holding study drug administration. The maximum tolerated dose was temsirolimus 15 mg/kg IV D1, 8, 15; topotecan 2.8 mg/m(2) IV D1, 8; and bortezomib 0.6 mg/m2 IV D1, 4, 8, 11 [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] of a 21-day cycle.

Germline Heterozygous Variants in SEC23B Are Associated with Cowden Syndrome and Enriched in Apparently Sporadic Thyroid Cancer.,American journal of human genetics,Am. J. Hum. Genet.,2015-10-29,"Cancer-predisposing genes associated with inherited cancer syndromes help explain mechanisms of sporadic carcinogenesis and often inform normal development. Cowden syndrome (CS) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by high lifetime risks of epithelial cancers, such that ∼50% of affected individuals are wild-type for known cancer-predisposing genes. Using whole-exome and Sanger sequencing of a multi-generation CS family affected by thyroid and other cancers, we identified a pathogenic missense heterozygous SEC23B variant (c.1781T>G [p.Val594Gly]) that segregates with the phenotype. We also found germline heterozygous SEC23B variants in 3/96 (3%) unrelated mutation-negative CS probands with thyroid cancer and in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), representing apparently sporadic cancers. We note that the TCGA thyroid cancer dataset is enriched with unique germline deleterious SEC23B variants associated with a significantly younger age of onset. SEC23B encodes Sec23 homolog B (S. cerevisiae), a component of coat protein complex II (COPII), which transports proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus.

PHTS confers increased risks for specific malignancies, most notably breast, thyroid, renal, and endometrial cancers. Benign tumors are common, affecting a variety of tissues, and can range from subtle skin papules requiring no treatment to devastating vascular anomalies. There is also a broad range of neurodevelopmental effects, with some patients having no challenges and others with severe autism spectrum disorder and mental retardation. While most cases are inherited in a family for generations, following an autosomal dominant pattern, at least 10% and perhaps as many as 44% of cases are due to a new (de novo) mutation. Clinical presentations can vary dramatically from patient to patient, even among those in the same family. Features of this condition that may assist in diagnosis prior to cancer development can be subtle and difficult to recognize.

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides of the tumor were reviewed to confirm areas with at least 25 % of tumor cellularity. Then, the designated area was extracted for genomic DNA. Targeted next-generation sequencing analysis was performed using a 47-gene panel. Case 1 is a 71-year-old man with high grade follicular thyroid carcinoma with clear cell and oncocytic features. The carcinoma showed a missense mutation in TP53 (p.R342G, c.1024C > G) and a 16-nucleotide intronic deletion started next to the 3' of exon 6 (involving the canonical +1 and +2 bases of the splice donor site) in STK11 (p.?, c.862 + 1_862 + 16delGTGGGAGCCTCATCCC).

Lenvatinib: Role in thyroid cancer and other solid tumors.,Cancer treatment reviews,Cancer Treat. Rev.,2015-12-02,"Despite recent breakthroughs in treatment of advanced thyroid cancers, prognoses remain poor. Treatment of advanced, progressive disease remains challenging, with limited treatment options. Small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including vandetanib, cabozantinib, sorafenib, and lenvatinib, which are now FDA-approved for thyroid cancer, have shown clinical benefit in advanced thyroid cancer. Lenvatinib is approved for treatment of locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). It has been studied in phase II and III trials for treatment of advanced RAI-refractory DTC, and in a phase II trial for medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Lenvatinib targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1-3 (VEGFR1-3), fibroblast growth factor receptors 1-4 (FGFR-1-4), RET, c-kit, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα). Its antitumor activity may be due to antiangiogenic properties and direct antitumor effects. Lenvatinib has demonstrated antitumor activity in a variety of solid tumors, including MTC, in phase I and II clinical trials. In a phase II study in advanced RAI-refractory DTC, lenvatinib-treated patients achieved a 50% response rate (RR), with median progression-free survival (PFS) of 12.6 months.

Germline PARP4 mutations in patients with primary thyroid and breast cancers.,Endocrine-related cancer,Endocr. Relat. Cancer,2015-12-23,"Germline mutations in the PTEN gene, which cause Cowden syndrome, are known to be one of the genetic factors for primary thyroid and breast cancers; however, PTEN mutations are found in only a small subset of research participants with non-syndrome breast and thyroid cancers. In this study, we aimed to identify germline variants that may be related to genetic risk of primary thyroid and breast cancers. Genomic DNAs extracted from peripheral blood of 14 PTEN WT female research participants with primary thyroid and breast cancers were analyzed by whole-exome sequencing. Gene-based case-control association analysis using the information of 406 Europeans obtained from the 1000 Genomes Project database identified 34 genes possibly associated with the phenotype with P < 1.0 × 10(-3). Among them, rare variants in the PARP4 gene were detected at significant high frequency (odds ratio = 5.2; P = 1.0 × 10(-5)). The variants, G496V and T1170I, were found in six of the 14 study participants (43%) while their frequencies were only 0.5% in controls. Functional analysis using HCC1143 cell line showed that knockdown of PARP4 with siRNA significantly enhanced the cell proliferation, compared with the cells transfected with siControl (P = 0.02). Kaplan-Meier analysis using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets showed poor relapse-free survival (P < 0.001, Hazard ratio 1.27) and overall survival (P = 0.006, Hazard ratio 1.41) in a PARP4 low-expression group, suggesting that PARP4 may function as a tumor suppressor.

Breast cancer risk estimates (67-85 %) for women with germline PTEN mutations are similar to those quoted for patients with germline mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes. With PTEN on several germline gene testing panels, finding PTEN mutations and variants have increased exponentially. PHTS can be differentiated from other hereditary cancer syndromes including Hereditary Breast Ovarian Cancer syndrome, Lynch syndrome, and hamartomatous polyposis syndromes based on personal as well as family history. However, many of the benign features of CS are common in the general population, making the diagnosis of CS challenging. Breast cancer patients with an identified germline PTEN mutation are at increased risk of endometrial, thyroid, renal, and colorectal cancers as well as a second breast cancer. Increased screening for the various component cancers as well as predictive testing in first-degree relatives is recommended. Prophylactic mastectomy may be considered especially if breast tissue is dense or if repeated breast biopsies have been necessary.

Is there a role for PET/CT parameters to differentiate thyroid cartilage invasion from penetration?,European journal of radiology,Eur J Radiol,2015-12-07,"Assessment of thyroid cartilage invasion (tumor extension through inner cortex) and thyroid cartilage penetration (tumor involving both the inner and outer cortices of thyroid cartilage) may be challenging with CT (Computed Tomography) and MR imaging (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) is a non invasive imaging modality that provides both anatomic and metabolic information. Quantitative data obtained from PET/CT, also known as PET/CT parameters, include maximum, mean or peak standardized uptake values (SUVmax, SUVmean, SUVpeak), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), standardized added metabolic activity (SAM) and normalized standardized added metabolic activity (NSAM). Our aim was to examine if FDG PET/CT parameters could differentiate thyroid cartilage invasion from penetration. 50 patients who underwent PET/CT before laryngectomy for squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, had SUVmax, SUVmean, SUVpeak, TLG, MTV, SAM and NSAM calculated on a dedicated workstation. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed. ROC analysis was used to determine the ability of PET/CT parameters to predict pathologically proven thyroid cartilage invasion or penetration. Of the 50 patients, 50% (25/50 patients) had history of prior radiation therapy. Among the previously irradiated group, 24% had thyroid cartilage invasion and penetration. 8% of the patients in this group had thyroid cartilage invasion only. Among the non-irradiated group, 76% had thyroid cartilage invasion and penetration, 8% had thyroid cartilage invasion without penetration. ROC analysis revealed that none of the PET/CT parameters had enough power to predict thyroid cartilage penetration, but TLG, MTV and SAM had enough power to predict thyroid cartilage invasion in non-irradiated patients. TLG, MTV, SAM and NSAM had enough power to predict thyroid cartilage invasion and penetration in irradiated group.

An International Multi-Institutional Validation of Age 55 Years as a Cutoff for Risk Stratification in the AJCC/UICC Staging System for Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2016-02-25,"Age is a critical factor in outcome for patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer. Currently, age 45 years is used as a cutoff in staging, although there is increasing evidence to suggest this may be too low. The aim of this study was to assess the potential for changing the cut point for the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) staging system from 45 years to 55 years based on a combined international patient cohort supplied by individual institutions. A total of 9484 patients were included from 10 institutions. Tumor (T), nodes (N), and metastasis (M) data and age were provided for each patient. The group was stratified by AJCC/UICC stage using age 45 years and age 55 years as cutoffs. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate outcomes for disease-specific survival (DSS). Concordance probability estimates (CPE) were calculated to compare the degree of concordance for each model. Using age 45 years as a cutoff, 10-year DSS rates for stage I-IV were 99.7%, 97.3%, 96.6%, and 76.3%, respectively. Using age 55 years as a cutoff, 10-year DSS rates for stage I-IV were 99.5%, 94.7%, 94.1%, and 67.6%, respectively. The change resulted in 12% of patients being downstaged, and the downstaged group had a 10-year DSS of 97.6%. The change resulted in an increase in CPE from 0.90 to 0.92. A change in the cutoff age in the current AJCC/UICC staging system from 45 years to 55 years would lead to a downstaging of 12% of patients, and would improve the statistical validity of the model.

Radiation-Related New Primary Solid Cancers in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study: Comparative Radiation Dose Response and Modification of Treatment Effects.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2015-12-15,"The majority of childhood cancer patients now achieve long-term survival, but the treatments that cured their malignancy often put them at risk of adverse health outcomes years later. New cancers are among the most serious of these late effects. The aims of this review are to compare and contrast radiation dose-response relationships for new solid cancers in a large cohort of childhood cancer survivors and to discuss interactions among treatment and host factors. This review is based on previously published site-specific analyses for subsequent primary cancers of the brain, breast, thyroid gland, bone and soft tissue, salivary glands, and skin among 12,268 5-year childhood cancer survivors in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. Analyses included tumor site-specific, individual radiation dose reconstruction based on radiation therapy records. Radiation-related second cancer risks were estimated using conditional logistic or Poisson regression models for excess relative risk (ERR). Linear dose-response relationships over a wide range of radiation dose (0-50 Gy) were seen for all cancer sites except the thyroid gland. The steepest slopes occurred for sarcoma, meningioma, and nonmelanoma skin cancer (ERR/Gy > 1.00), with glioma and cancers of the breast and salivary glands forming a second group (ERR/Gy = 0.27-0.36). The relative risk for thyroid cancer increased up to 15-20 Gy and then decreased with increasing dose. The risk of thyroid cancer also was positively associated with chemotherapy, but the chemotherapy effect was not seen among those who also received very high doses of radiation to the thyroid. The excess risk of radiation-related breast cancer was sharply reduced among women who received 5 Gy or more to the ovaries. The results suggest that the effect of high-dose irradiation is consistent with a linear dose-response for most organs, but they also reveal important organ-specific and host-specific differences in susceptibility and interactions between different aspects of treatment.",Journal Article,1498.0,47.0,"The majority of childhood cancer patients now achieve long-term survival but the treatments that cured their malignancy often put them at risk of adverse health outcomes years later New cancers are among the most serious of these late effects The aims of this review are to compare and contrast radiation dose-response relationships for new solid cancers in a large cohort of childhood cancer survivors and to discuss interactions among treatment and host factors This review is based on previously published site-specific analyses for subsequent primary cancers of the brain gland and soft tissue glands and among 12,268 5-year childhood cancer survivors in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study Analyses included tumor site-specific individual radiation dose reconstruction based on radiation therapy records Radiation-related second cancer risks were estimated using conditional logistic or Poisson regression models for excess relative risk ERR Linear dose-response relationships over a wide range of radiation dose 0-50 Gy were seen for all cancer sites except the gland The steepest slopes occurred for meningioma and nonmelanoma cancer ERR/Gy 1.00 with glioma and cancers of the and glands forming a second group ERR/Gy 0.27-0.36 The relative risk for cancer increased up to 15-20 Gy and then decreased with increasing dose The risk of cancer also was positively associated with chemotherapy but the chemotherapy effect was not seen among those who also received very high doses of radiation to the The excess risk of radiation-related cancer was sharply reduced among women who received 5 Gy or more to the ovaries The results suggest that the effect of high-dose irradiation is consistent with a linear dose-response for most organs but they also reveal important organ-specific and host-specific differences in susceptibility and interactions between different aspects of treatment",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[3, 686, 1, 864, 12, 7, 1134, 1359, 319, 337, 25, 84, 3, 640, 17, 3733, 136, 710, 629, 8795, 1370, 28, 43, 1, 290, 341, 123, 60, 1559, 217, 163, 32, 107, 3, 96, 1762, 1, 46, 807, 176, 3, 2970, 1, 26, 206, 32, 6, 932, 2, 748, 121, 61, 51, 2467, 9, 217, 537, 163, 4, 8, 375, 180, 1, 864, 12, 332, 2, 6, 1139, 1286, 107, 24, 2, 1204, 130, 26, 206, 16, 90, 23, 373, 983, 606, 112, 318, 9, 706, 86, 163, 1, 3, 342, 2326, 2, 1214, 246, 3966, 2, 107, 133, 8410, 33, 111, 864, 12, 332, 4, 3, 864, 12, 2628, 45, 318, 159, 30, 606, 112, 797, 121, 61, 1470, 90, 23, 121, 36, 1064, 121, 139, 419, 12, 1098, 11, 661, 75, 3212, 812, 15, 7668, 320, 274, 9, 2612, 580, 43, 16839, 1646, 61, 51, 2467, 252, 8, 1019, 184, 1, 121, 61, 13, 212, 381, 11, 527, 9, 62, 12, 633, 2187, 3, 2326, 3, 35759, 19612, 489, 9, 3944, 2, 7814, 12, 16839, 381, 14, 2038, 5, 945, 2, 163, 1, 3, 2, 3966, 4525, 8, 419, 87, 16839, 381, 13, 428, 13, 511, 3, 580, 43, 9, 12, 101, 126, 6, 167, 179, 381, 2, 818, 340, 5, 602, 61, 3, 43, 1, 12, 120, 10, 2375, 41, 5, 56, 84, 3, 56, 254, 10, 44, 527, 107, 135, 54, 120, 103, 923, 64, 415, 1, 121, 6, 3, 3, 2612, 43, 1, 121, 139, 12, 10, 10833, 405, 107, 117, 54, 103, 33, 381, 15, 80, 6, 3, 7262, 3, 99, 309, 17, 3, 254, 1, 64, 61, 1104, 16, 925, 5, 8, 1646, 61, 51, 9, 96, 2285, 84, 491, 120, 2396, 305, 1259, 112, 2, 1204, 112, 362, 4, 1432, 2, 1286, 59, 338, 2695, 1, 24]",1889.0,26972653,261
pAKT Expression and Response to Sorafenib in Differentiated Thyroid Cancer.,Hormones & cancer,Horm Cancer,2016-03-18,"Sorafenib has an antitumor activity in patients with radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma (RAIR-DTC). Prior research has implicated signaling through the MAPK and AKT/PI3K pathways in the progression of DTC. To assess whether the activity of these pathways is predictive of response to sorafenib, we retrospectively studied molecular tumor markers from these two pathways from a phase 2 study of sorafenib in RAIR-DTC. Tumor samples from 40 of 53 DTC subjects obtained prior to initiation of sorafenib were immunostained with DAB-labeled antibodies to phospho-AKT (pAKT), phospho-ERK (pERK), and phospho-S6 (pS6). BRAFV600E genetic mutation analysis was performed on all samples. Expression levels and mutational status were compared to response and progression-free survival (PFS) for each patient. Low tumor expression of nuclear pAKT was associated with partial response to sorafenib (p < 0.01). Patients with nuclear pAKT expression that was below the median for our sample were more than three times as likely to have a partial response as patients with equal to or above median expression. There was no correlation between tumor expression of nuclear pERK or pS6 and response. Endothelial cell and pericyte expression of pERK, pAKT, and pS6 were not predictive of response. There was no correlation between BRAFV600E mutation status and partial response. No correlation was observed between either the expression of pAKT, pERK, or pS6, or the presence of the BRAFV600E mutation, and PFS. In conclusion, lower tumor expression of nuclear pAKT was associated with higher rate of response to sorafenib. This observation justifies evaluation of combination therapy with sorafenib and an inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in RAIR-DTC.",Journal Article,1404.0,4.0,Sorafenib has an antitumor activity in patients with radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated carcinoma RAIR-DTC Prior research has implicated signaling through the MAPK and AKT/PI3K pathways in the progression of DTC To assess whether the activity of these pathways is predictive of response to sorafenib we retrospectively studied molecular tumor markers from these two pathways from a phase 2 study of sorafenib in RAIR-DTC Tumor samples from 40 of 53 DTC subjects obtained prior to initiation of sorafenib were immunostained with DAB-labeled antibodies to phospho-AKT pAKT phospho-ERK pERK and phospho-S6 pS6 BRAFV600E genetic mutation analysis was performed on all samples Expression levels and mutational status were compared to response and progression-free survival PFS for each patient Low tumor expression of nuclear pAKT was associated with partial response to sorafenib p 0.01 Patients with nuclear pAKT expression that was below the median for our sample were more than three times as likely to have a partial response as patients with equal to or above median expression There was no correlation between tumor expression of nuclear pERK or pS6 and response Endothelial cell and pericyte expression of pERK pAKT and pS6 were not predictive of response There was no correlation between BRAFV600E mutation status and partial response No correlation was observed between either the expression of pAKT pERK or pS6 or the presence of the BRAFV600E mutation and PFS In conclusion lower tumor expression of nuclear pAKT was associated with higher rate of response to sorafenib This observation justifies evaluation of combination therapy with sorafenib and an inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in RAIR-DTC,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[1034, 71, 35, 579, 128, 4, 7, 5, 4741, 4287, 430, 1442, 134, 16923, 5201, 324, 389, 71, 1771, 314, 298, 3, 1748, 2, 649, 974, 460, 4, 3, 91, 1, 5201, 6, 423, 317, 3, 128, 1, 46, 460, 16, 464, 1, 51, 6, 1034, 21, 894, 656, 219, 30, 525, 29, 46, 100, 460, 29, 8, 124, 18, 45, 1, 1034, 4, 16923, 5201, 30, 347, 29, 327, 1, 699, 5201, 976, 683, 324, 6, 1118, 1, 1034, 11, 12173, 5, 14459, 2841, 890, 6, 3125, 649, 6724, 3125, 1819, 6621, 2, 3125, 4977, 12428, 9315, 336, 258, 65, 10, 173, 23, 62, 347, 55, 148, 2, 1619, 156, 11, 72, 6, 51, 2, 91, 115, 25, 300, 9, 296, 69, 154, 30, 55, 1, 928, 6724, 10, 41, 5, 450, 51, 6, 1034, 19, 13, 355, 7, 5, 928, 6724, 55, 17, 10, 2736, 3, 52, 9, 114, 1000, 11, 80, 76, 169, 1072, 22, 322, 6, 47, 8, 450, 51, 22, 7, 5, 2997, 6, 15, 2090, 52, 55, 125, 10, 77, 816, 59, 30, 55, 1, 928, 6621, 15, 12428, 2, 51, 845, 31, 2, 11143, 55, 1, 6621, 6724, 2, 12428, 11, 44, 464, 1, 51, 125, 10, 77, 816, 59, 9315, 258, 156, 2, 450, 51, 77, 816, 10, 164, 59, 361, 3, 55, 1, 6724, 6621, 15, 12428, 15, 3, 463, 1, 3, 9315, 258, 2, 300, 4, 1221, 280, 30, 55, 1, 928, 6724, 10, 41, 5, 142, 116, 1, 51, 6, 1034, 26, 1664, 13299, 451, 1, 150, 36, 5, 1034, 2, 35, 230, 1, 3, 974, 649, 314, 308, 4, 16923, 5201]",1725.0,26994002,230
A Comparative Evaluation of Normal Tissue Doses for Patients Receiving Radiation Therapy for Hodgkin Lymphoma on the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study and Recent Children's Oncology Group Trials.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2016-02-04,"Survivors of pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) are recognized to have an increased risk of delayed adverse health outcomes related to radiation therapy (RT). However, the necessary latency required to observe these late effects means that the estimated risks apply to outdated treatments. We sought to compare the normal tissue dose received by children treated for HL and enrolled in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) (diagnosed 1970-1986) with that of patients treated in recent Children's Oncology Group (COG) trials (enrolled 2002-2012). RT planning data were obtained for 50 HL survivors randomly sampled from the CCSS cohort and applied to computed tomography planning data sets to reconstruct the normal tissue dosimetry. For comparison, the normal tissue dosimetry data were obtained for all 191 patients with full computed tomography-based volumetric RT planning on COG protocols AHOD0031 and AHOD0831. For early-stage patients, the mean female breast dose in the COG patients was on average 83.5% lower than that for CCSS patients, with an absolute reduction of 15.5 Gy. For advanced-stage patients, the mean breast dose was decreased on average by 70% (11.6 Gy average absolute dose reduction). The mean heart dose decreased on average by 22.9 Gy (68.6%) and 17.6 Gy (56.8%) for early- and advanced-stage patients, respectively. All dose comparisons for breast, heart, lung, and thyroid were significantly lower for patients in the COG trials than for the CCSS participants.

Preoperative catheter spinal angiography and embolization of cervical spinal tumors: Outcomes from a single center.,"Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",Interv Neuroradiol,2016-03-27,"The existing literature regarding preoperative cervical spinal tumor embolization is sparse, with few discussions on the indications, risks, and best techniques. We present our experience with the preoperative endovascular management of hypervascular cervical spinal tumors. We performed a retrospective review of all patients who underwent preoperative spinal angiography (regardless of whether tumor embolization was performed) at our institution (from 2002 to 2012) for primary and metastatic cervical spinal tumors. Tumor vascularity was graded from 0 (tumor blush equal to the normal adjacent vertebral body) to 3 (intense tumor blush with arteriovenous shunting). Tumors were considered ""hypervascular"" if they had a tumor vascular grade from 1 to 3. Embolic materials included particles, liquid embolics, and detachable coils. The main embolization technique was superselective catheterization of an arterial tumor feeder followed by injection of embolic material. This technique could be used alone or supplemented with occlusion of dangerous anastomoses of the vertebral artery as needed to prevent inadvertent embolization of the vertebrobasilar system. In cases when superselective catheterization of the tumoral feeder was not feasible, embolization was performed from a proximal catheter position after occlusion of branches supplying areas other than the tumor (""flow diversion""). A total of 47 patients with 49 cervical spinal tumors were included in this study. Of the 49 total tumors, 41 demonstrated increased vascularity (vascularity score > 0). The most common tumor pathology in our series was renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (N = 16; 32.7% of all tumors) followed by thyroid carcinoma (N = 7; 14.3% of all tumors).Tumor embolization was undertaken in 25 hypervascular tumors resulting in complete, near-complete, and partial embolization in 36.0% (N = 9), 44.0% (N = 11), and 20.0% (N = 5) of embolized tumors, respectively. We embolized 42 tumor feeders in 25 tumors. The most commonly embolized tumor feeders were branches of the vertebral artery (19.0%; N = 8), the deep cervical artery (19.0%; N = 8), and the ascending cervical artery (19.0%; N = 8). Sixteen hypervascular tumors were not embolized because of minimal hypervascularity (8/16), unacceptably high risk of spinal cord or vertebrobasilar ischemia (4/16), failed superselective catheterization of tumor feeder (3/16), and cancellation of surgery (1/16). Vertebral artery occlusion was performed in 20% of embolizations. There were no new post-procedure neurological deficits or any serious adverse events. Estimated blood loss data from this cohort show a significant decrease in operative blood loss for embolized tumors of moderate and significant hypervascularity.

Second primary malignancies in renal cortical neoplasms: an updated evaluation from a single institution.,World journal of urology,World J Urol,2016-04-22,"To examine the incidence of secondary primary malignancies in patients with renal cortical neoplasms. Between January 1989 and July 2010, 3647 patients underwent surgery at our institution for a renal cortical neoplasm and were followed through 2012. Occurrence of other malignancies was classified as antecedent, synchronous, or subsequent. All patients with antecedent malignancies (n = 498) and a randomly selected half of those with synchronous malignancies (n = 83) were excluded. The expected number of second primaries was calculated by multiplying Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program incidence rates of renal cortical neoplasms by person-years at risk within categories of age, sex, and year of diagnosis. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated as observed cancers divided by expected incidence of the cancer, with approximation to the exact Poisson test used to obtain confidence intervals (CI) and p values. Of 3066 patients with renal cortical neoplasms, 267 had a second primary cancer; the five most common in men were prostate, colorectal, bladder, lung, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; the five most common in women were breast, colorectal, lung, endometrium, and thyroid.

Long-term vemurafenib treatment drives inhibitor resistance through a spontaneous KRAS G12D mutation in a BRAF V600E papillary thyroid carcinoma model.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2016-05-01,"The BRAF V600E mutation is commonly observed in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and predominantly activates the MAPK pathway. Presence of BRAF V600E predicts increasing risk of recurrence and higher mortality rate, and treatment options for such patients are limited. Vemurafenib, a BRAF V600E inhibitor, is initially effective, but cells inevitably develop alternative mechanisms of pathway activation. Mechanisms of primary resistance have been described in short-term cultures of PTC cells; however, mechanisms of acquired resistance have not. In the present study, we investigated possible adaptive mechanisms of BRAF V600E inhibitor resistance in KTC1 thyroid cancer cells following long-term vemurafenib exposure. We found that a subpopulation of KTC1 cells acquired resistance to vemurafenib following 5 months of treatment with the inhibitor. Resistance coincided with the spontaneous acquisition of a KRAS G12D activating mutation. Increases in activated AKT, ERK1/2, and EGFR were observed in these cells. In addition, the resistant cells were less sensitive to combinations of vemurafenib and MEK1 inhibitor or AKT inhibitor. These results support the KRAS G12D mutation as a genetic mechanism of spontaneously acquired secondary BRAF inhibitor resistance in BRAF V600E thyroid cancer cells.

Follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer.,Nature reviews. Disease primers,Nat Rev Dis Primers,2015-12-10,"Follicular cell-derived thyroid cancers are derived from the follicular cells in the thyroid gland, which secrete the iodine-containing thyroid hormones. Follicular cell-derived thyroid cancers can be classified into papillary thyroid cancer (80-85%), follicular thyroid cancer (10-15%), poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (<2%) and undifferentiated (anaplastic) thyroid cancer (<2%), and these have an excellent prognosis with the exception of undifferentiated thyroid cancer. The advent and expansion of advanced diagnostic techniques has driven and continues to drive the epidemic of occult papillary thyroid cancer, owing to overdiagnosis of clinically irrelevant nodules. This transformation of the thyroid cancer landscape at molecular and clinical levels calls for the modification of management strategies towards personalized medicine based on individual risk assessment to deliver the most effective but least aggressive treatment. In thyroid cancer surgery, for instance, injuries to structures outside the thyroid gland, such as the recurrent laryngeal nerve in 2-5% of surgeries or the parathyroid glands in 5-10% of surgeries, negatively affect quality of life more than loss of the expendable thyroid gland. Furthermore, the risks associated with radioiodine ablation may outweigh the risks of persistent or recurrent disease and disease-specific mortality. Improvement in the health-related quality of life of survivors of follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer, which is decreased despite the generally favourable outcome, hinges on early tumour detection and minimization of treatment-related sequelae. Future opportunities include more widespread adoption of molecular and clinical risk stratification and identification of actionable targets for individualized therapies.",Journal Article,1503.0,22.0,Follicular cell-derived cancers are derived from the follicular cells in the gland which secrete the iodine-containing hormones Follicular cell-derived cancers can be classified into papillary cancer 80-85 follicular cancer 10-15 poorly differentiated cancer 2 and undifferentiated anaplastic cancer 2 and these have an excellent prognosis with the exception of undifferentiated cancer The advent and expansion of advanced diagnostic techniques has driven and continues to drive the epidemic of occult papillary cancer owing to overdiagnosis of clinically irrelevant nodules This transformation of the cancer landscape at molecular and clinical levels calls for the modification of management strategies towards personalized medicine based on individual risk assessment to deliver the most effective but least aggressive treatment In cancer surgery for instance injuries to structures outside the gland such as the recurrent nerve in 2-5 of surgeries or the glands in 5-10 of surgeries negatively affect quality of life more than loss of the expendable gland Furthermore the risks associated with radioiodine ablation may outweigh the risks of persistent or recurrent disease and disease-specific mortality Improvement in the health-related quality of life of survivors of follicular cell-derived cancer which is decreased despite the generally favourable outcome hinges on early tumour detection and minimization of treatment-related sequelae Future opportunities include more widespread adoption of molecular and clinical risk stratification and identification of actionable targets for individualized therapies,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[1974, 31, 526, 163, 32, 526, 29, 3, 1974, 37, 4, 3, 2326, 92, 6401, 3, 4287, 1101, 4927, 1974, 31, 526, 163, 122, 40, 1373, 237, 1796, 12, 493, 772, 1974, 12, 79, 167, 1240, 1442, 12, 18, 2, 4480, 1841, 12, 18, 2, 46, 47, 35, 1503, 356, 5, 3, 4188, 1, 4480, 12, 3, 4114, 2, 1422, 1, 131, 752, 1092, 71, 1621, 2, 2274, 6, 3279, 3, 12515, 1, 2879, 1796, 12, 3421, 6, 10700, 1, 505, 20237, 2597, 26, 1392, 1, 3, 12, 2801, 28, 219, 2, 38, 148, 6467, 9, 3, 2437, 1, 284, 422, 3113, 2175, 1807, 90, 23, 797, 43, 455, 6, 3392, 3, 96, 323, 84, 506, 571, 24, 4, 12, 152, 9, 10642, 13063, 6, 2414, 2513, 3, 2326, 225, 22, 3, 387, 2476, 4, 18, 33, 1, 5305, 15, 3, 3966, 4, 33, 79, 1, 5305, 2723, 1158, 372, 1, 358, 80, 76, 407, 1, 3, 68191, 2326, 798, 3, 1098, 41, 5, 7211, 1650, 68, 11592, 3, 1098, 1, 1882, 15, 387, 34, 2, 34, 112, 282, 767, 4, 3, 341, 139, 372, 1, 358, 1, 332, 1, 1974, 31, 526, 12, 92, 16, 340, 550, 3, 1228, 6816, 228, 39232, 23, 191, 770, 638, 2, 12807, 1, 24, 139, 4156, 508, 2605, 643, 80, 3029, 4350, 1, 219, 2, 38, 43, 1541, 2, 911, 1, 2856, 637, 9, 2596, 235]",1613.0,27188261,161

Several studies have suggested that patients who develop hypothyroidism respond better to TKIs, but this relationship is not well elucidated. We evaluated the relationship between new-onset hypothyroidism and clinical response in patients with advanced cancers treated with TKIs at our institution. We retrospectively reviewed records for patients from four clinical trials that included at least one TKI  therapy between January 2006 and December 2011. Patients with preexisting thyroid disease, including thyroid cancer, hypothyroidism, or hyperthyroidism, were excluded. Analysis of 197 patients was performed. Response was determined using RECIST 1.0. Clinical benefit was described as complete response, partial response, or stable disease greater than 4 months. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to correlate patient characteristics with clinical response. The median age for the 197 patients was 58 years (range, 13-85 years), and 56 % were female. Of the 197 patients, 52 (26 %) developed hypothyroidism after therapy. Clinical benefit rates were 50 % in patients with new-onset hypothyroidism versus 34 % in patients without hypothyroidism.

Cancer Incidence in First- and Second-Degree Relatives of BRCA1 and BRCA2 Mutation Carriers.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2016-06-15,"Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are associated with increased risk of breast, ovarian, and several other cancers. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the incidence of cancer in first- and second-degree relatives of BRCA mutation carriers compared with the general population. A total of 1,086 pedigrees of BRCA mutation carriers was obtained from a prospectively maintained, internal review board-approved study of persons referred for clinical genetic counseling at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. We identified 9,032 first- and second-degree relatives from 784 pedigrees that had demonstrated a clear indication of parental origin of mutation. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to compare the observed incidence of 20 primary cancer sites to the expected incidence of each cancer based on the calculated risk estimates according to each subject's age, sex, and ethnicity. BRCA1 families had increased SIRs for breast and ovarian cancer (p < .001) and decreased SIRs for kidney, lung, prostate, and thyroid cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (p < .001). BRCA2 families had increased SIRs for breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer (p < .001) and decreased SIRs for kidney, lung, thyroid, and uterine cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (p < .0025). Analysis of only first-degree relatives (n = 4,099) identified no decreased SIRs and agreed with the increased SIRs observed in the overall study population. We have confirmed previous reports of an association between breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers with BRCA mutations. Additional research to quantify the relative risks of these cancers for BRCA mutation carriers can help tailor recommendations for risk reduction and enhance genetic counseling.

Spine Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Patients with Metastatic Thyroid Cancer: Secondary Analysis of Phase I/II Trials.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2016-07-25,"Metastatic deposits to the spine in thyroid cancer patients represent the most common site of bone involvement and can contribute to pain, neurologic deficits, and death. This study sought to determine the efficacy and safety of spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SSRS) for thyroid cancer patients. Thyroid cancer patients with spine metastases were selected and analyzed from a cohort of patients who were prospectively enrolled in two single-institution Phase I/II studies. SSRS was delivered in single or multi-fraction schedules. Dose regimens ranged from 16-18 Gy in one fraction to 27-30 Gy in three to five fractions. Toxicity was graded according to the NCI-CTC toxicity scale. Local control was determined by serial post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging scans showing no evidence of progressive disease. Patients were followed until date of death or date of last known visit for survival analyses. Local control and overall survival rates were carried out using Kaplan-Meier estimates. The log-rank test was used to assess the equality of the survivor function across groups. A p-value of ≤0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. A total of 27 spine lesions were treated in 23 patients over a six-year period. Median follow-up was 28.9 months (range 5-93 months). Local control was 88% at two years and 79% at three years. In patients with progressive disease following conventional radiation therapy, local control for salvage SSRS remained at 88% at three years. Patients requiring upfront surgical intervention and treated with adjuvant SSRS achieved sustained control rates of 86% at three years. Overall survival rates were 85% and 67% at one and two years, respectively. In patients classified with oligoprogression and controlled extra-spinal disease, overall survival was significantly higher than those with evidence of systemic progression (81% vs. 45% at two years; p = 0.01). Univariate analysis did not show significant correlations between local control and age, systemic disease status, prior (131)I therapy, SSRS fraction regimen, spine location, histological subtype, or time from initial diagnosis to evidence of spinal metastasis.

Complete metastasectomy for renal cell carcinoma: Comparison of five solid organ sites.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2016-06-23,"Patients with metastatic RCC can undergo metastasectomy to improve survival time. Our goal was to provide and compare characteristics and oncological outcomes of RCC patients who underwent complete metastasectomy at a single organ site. A total of 138 RCC patients were identified as undergoing complete metastasectomy at a single organ site including adrenal, lung, liver, pancreas, or thyroid. Competing risk regression analysis was used to assess RFS and CSS adjusting for several covariates. In this highly selected cohort, RFS and CSS was 27% and 84% at 5 years following metastasectomy, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that removal of multiple tumors, younger age, and a shorter interval between nephrectomy and metastasis was associated with worse RFS. Larger tumors and sarcomatoid histology at nephrectomy was associated with worse CSS. We found no evidence that metastases at the time of RCC diagnosis influenced recurrence or survival. Tumor size, number of metastases resected, and time from nephrectomy to first recurrence was significantly different, but recurrence rates were not found to be significantly different, when compared across all organ sites. These findings inform clinical and surgical management of select RCC patients with isolated metastasis to one of several organ sites. J. Surg.

Absence of Basal Cell Carcinoma in Irradiated Childhood Cancer Survivors of Black Race: A Report from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study.,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev.,2016-06-30,"Cancer survivors exposed to therapeutic radiation are at increased risk for basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Despite the notable influence of race on rates of BCC in the general population, the same is not clearly defined in previously irradiated cancer survivors. We investigated the influence of race on the development of BCC in adult survivors of childhood cancer. Using a retrospective cohort study, outcomes were collected through June 30, 2015, for 1,746 irradiated childhood cancer survivors participating in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study (SJLIFE), comprising a total of 33,147 person-years of follow-up. Subsequent neoplasms identified in survivors through self-report and prospective clinical assessment were validated by pathology reports. Expected numbers of each type of radiation-associated neoplasm, including BCC, were calculated for irradiated black survivors based on rates in irradiated white survivors, accounting for primary cancer diagnosis, diagnosis year, attained age, and sex. On the basis of the rate of BCC in previously irradiated white survivors, 56.1 BCCs were expected among 237 black survivors, yet none observed. In contrast, the observed-to-expected ratio of non-BCC radiation-associated neoplasms (melanoma, brain, breast, thyroid cancer) was 0.88 (30 observed/34.2 expected, 95% confidence interval, 0.59-1.25). We identified an unexpected absence of BCC in irradiated black survivors in SJLIFE. We observe a similar absence of BCC in black individuals among two additional cohorts treated with irradiation for childhood cancer. Black survivors are at a substantially reduced or absent risk for BCC from therapeutic radiation for reasons not yet fully understood.

Endocrine Abnormalities in Aging Survivors of Childhood Cancer: A Report From the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-07-05,"The development of endocrinopathies in survivors of childhood cancer as they age remains understudied. We characterized endocrine outcomes in aging survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study on the basis of therapeutic exposures. We analyzed self-reported conditions in 14,290 5-year survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, with a median age 6 years (range, < 1 to 20 years) at diagnosis and 32 years (range, 5 to 58 years) at last follow-up. Identification of high-risk therapeutic exposures was adopted from the Children's Oncology Group Long-Term Follow-Up Guidelines. Cumulative incidence curves and prevalence estimates quantified and regression models compared risks of primary hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, thyroid neoplasms, hypopituitarism, obesity, diabetes mellitus, or gonadal dysfunction between survivors and siblings. The cumulative incidence and prevalence of endocrine abnormalities increased across the lifespan of survivors (P < .01 for all). Risk was significantly higher in survivors exposed to high-risk therapies compared with survivors not so exposed for primary hypothyroidism (hazard ratio [HR], 6.6; 95% CI, 5.6 to 7.8), hyperthyroidism (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.8), thyroid nodules (HR, 6.3; 95% CI, 5.2 to 7.5), thyroid cancer (HR, 9.2; 95% CI, 6.2 to 13.7), growth hormone deficiency (HR, 5.3; 95% CI, 4.3 to 6.4), obesity (relative risk, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.7 to 2.0), and diabetes mellitus (relative risk, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.6 to 2.4).

Is postablation whole-body <sup>131</sup> I scintigraphy still necessary in intermediate-risk papillary thyroid cancer patients with pre-ablation stimulated thyroglobulin <1 ng/mL?,Clinical endocrinology,Clin. Endocrinol. (Oxf),2016-08-15,"Postablation whole-body scintigraphy, which is performed 5-7 days after administration of ablation activity of radioactive iodine-131 (<sup>131</sup> I) in patients with thyroid cancer, is considered a routine procedure for remnant ablation and a useful tool for disease staging. However, the relationship of pre-ablation stimulated thyroglobulin (s-Tg) levels with postablation scintigraphic findings has not been evaluated. The current study was designed to determine the diagnostic value of postablation <sup>131</sup> I scintigraphy during initial staging and risk stratification in intermediate-risk papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) patients with pre-ablation s-Tg < 1 ng/ml at the time of ablation. From January 2013 to July 2015, consecutive PTC patients at intermediate-risk of recurrence according to American Thyroid Association criteria were prospectively recruited. Patients had to have pre-ablation s-Tg < 1 ng/ml in the absence of anti-Tg antibody at the time of ablation. Systematic pre-ablation neck ultrasonography was performed for each patient. Postablation whole-body planar scintigraphy was obtained 5 days after administration of ablation activity of <sup>131</sup> I. Single photon emission computed tomography/low-dose computed tomography was added for patients whose planar findings were inconclusive. Among 756 patients ablated, 240 (31·7%) patients were eligible for the analysis. Pre-ablation neck ultrasonography revealed lymph node metastases in eight of the 240 patients. Postablation scintigraphy showed ectopic neck uptake corresponding to the lymph nodes seen by ultrasonography in four patients and revealed neck lymph node metastases in another two patients whose ultrasonography findings were negative. None of the 240 patients showed distant metastasis on postablation scintigraphy. Neither staging nor initial risk stratification was altered by postablation scintigraphy in the included patients with pre-ablation s-Tg < 1 ng/ml. As postablation whole-body scintigraphy played a minimal role in improving staging or initial risk stratification in intermediate-risk PTC patients with pre-ablation s-Tg < 1 ng/ml, we propose that postablation scintigraphy may be omitted in this group of patients. Multi-institutional larger studies are necessary to draw definitive conclusions.",Journal Article,1254.0,7.0,Postablation whole-body scintigraphy which is performed 5-7 days after administration of ablation activity of radioactive iodine-131 sup 131 /sup I in patients with cancer is considered a routine procedure for remnant ablation and a useful tool for disease staging However the relationship of pre-ablation stimulated thyroglobulin s-Tg levels with postablation scintigraphic findings has not been evaluated The current study was designed to determine the diagnostic value of postablation sup 131 /sup I scintigraphy during initial staging and risk stratification in intermediate-risk papillary cancer PTC patients with pre-ablation s-Tg 1 ng/ml at the time of ablation From January 2013 to July 2015 consecutive PTC patients at intermediate-risk of recurrence according to American Association criteria were prospectively recruited Patients had to have pre-ablation s-Tg 1 ng/ml in the absence of anti-Tg antibody at the time of ablation Systematic pre-ablation ultrasonography was performed for each patient Postablation whole-body planar scintigraphy was obtained 5 days after administration of ablation activity of sup 131 /sup I Single photon emission computed tomography/low-dose computed tomography was added for patients whose planar findings were inconclusive Among 756 patients ablated 240 31·7 patients were eligible for the analysis Pre-ablation ultrasonography revealed lymph node metastases in eight of the 240 patients Postablation scintigraphy showed ectopic uptake corresponding to the lymph nodes seen by ultrasonography in four patients and revealed lymph node metastases in another two patients whose ultrasonography findings were negative None of the 240 patients showed distant metastasis on postablation scintigraphy Neither staging nor initial risk stratification was altered by postablation scintigraphy in the included patients with pre-ablation s-Tg 1 ng/ml As postablation whole-body scintigraphy played a minimal role in improving staging or initial risk stratification in intermediate-risk PTC patients with pre-ablation s-Tg 1 ng/ml we propose that postablation scintigraphy may be omitted in this group of patients Multi-institutional larger studies are necessary to draw definitive conclusions,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[16114, 902, 642, 7577, 92, 16, 173, 33, 67, 162, 50, 634, 1, 1650, 128, 1, 4741, 4287, 2229, 172, 2229, 172, 70, 4, 7, 5, 12, 16, 515, 8, 1311, 1299, 9, 5644, 1650, 2, 8, 999, 1515, 9, 34, 632, 137, 3, 858, 1, 671, 1650, 2816, 8978, 695, 5107, 148, 5, 16114, 23235, 272, 71, 44, 85, 194, 3, 291, 45, 10, 1114, 6, 223, 3, 752, 549, 1, 16114, 172, 2229, 172, 70, 7577, 190, 388, 632, 2, 43, 1541, 4, 919, 43, 1796, 12, 3748, 7, 5, 671, 1650, 695, 5107, 14, 997, 542, 28, 3, 98, 1, 1650, 29, 1024, 1346, 6, 2066, 1483, 935, 3748, 7, 28, 919, 43, 1, 146, 768, 6, 597, 248, 371, 11, 1143, 2619, 7, 42, 6, 47, 671, 1650, 695, 5107, 14, 997, 542, 4, 3, 1127, 1, 312, 5107, 548, 28, 3, 98, 1, 1650, 1556, 671, 1650, 4244, 10, 173, 9, 296, 69, 16114, 902, 642, 9042, 7577, 10, 683, 33, 162, 50, 634, 1, 1650, 128, 1, 172, 2229, 172, 70, 226, 4216, 1799, 1220, 872, 154, 61, 1220, 872, 10, 1953, 9, 7, 1310, 9042, 272, 11, 6791, 107, 13606, 7, 9463, 4263, 35704, 7, 11, 625, 9, 3, 65, 671, 1650, 4244, 553, 263, 289, 196, 4, 659, 1, 3, 4263, 7, 16114, 7577, 224, 3647, 1135, 1734, 6, 3, 263, 502, 527, 20, 4244, 4, 294, 7, 2, 553, 263, 289, 196, 4, 1809, 100, 7, 1310, 4244, 272, 11, 199, 1292, 1, 3, 4263, 7, 224, 626, 278, 23, 16114, 7577, 2174, 632, 2110, 388, 43, 1541, 10, 1495, 20, 16114, 7577, 4, 3, 159, 7, 5, 671, 1650, 695, 5107, 14, 997, 542, 22, 16114, 902, 642, 7577, 7680, 8, 1048, 200, 4, 1673, 632, 15, 388, 43, 1541, 4, 919, 43, 3748, 7, 5, 671, 1650, 695, 5107, 14, 997, 542, 21, 2548, 17, 16114, 7577, 68, 40, 7138, 4, 26, 87, 1, 7, 1414, 1115, 1077, 94, 32, 1493, 6, 7223, 1057, 2130]",2225.0,27434740,128
"Vemurafenib in patients with BRAF(V600E)-positive metastatic or unresectable papillary thyroid cancer refractory to radioactive iodine: a non-randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 2 trial.",The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2016-07-23,"About half of patients with papillary thyroid cancer have tumours with activating BRAF(V600E) mutations. Vemurafenib, an oncogenic BRAF kinase inhibitor approved for BRAF-positive melanoma, showed clinical benefit in three patients with BRAF(V600E)-positive papillary thyroid cancer in a phase 1 trial. We aimed to establish the activity of vemurafenib in patients with BRAF(V600E)-positive papillary thyroid cancer. We did an open-label, non-randomised, phase 2 trial at ten academic centres and hospitals worldwide in patients aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic papillary thyroid cancer refractory to radioactive iodine and positive for the BRAF(V600E) mutation. Participants either had never received a multikinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR (cohort 1) or had been treated previously with a VEGFR multikinase inhibitor (cohort 2). Patients received vemurafenib 960 mg orally twice daily. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed best overall response in cohort 1 (confirmed on two assessments 4 weeks or longer apart). Analyses were planned to have a minimum median follow-up of 15 months (data cutoff April 18, 2014) and were done in safety, intention-to-treat, and per-protocol populations. This trial is closed and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01286753. Between June 23, 2011, and Jan 15, 2013, 51 patients were enrolled to the study, 26 in cohort 1 and 25 in cohort 2. Median duration of follow-up was 18·8 months (IQR 14·2-26·0) in cohort 1 and 12·0 months (6·7-20·3) in cohort 2. Partial responses were recorded in ten of 26 patients in cohort 1 (best overall response 38·5%, 95% CI 20·2-59·4). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were recorded in 17 (65%) of 26 patients in cohort 1 and 17 (68%) of 25 patients in cohort 2; the most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (seven [27%] in cohort 1, five [20%] in cohort 2), lymphopenia (two [8%] in each cohort), and increased γ-glutamyltransferase (one [4%] in cohort 1, three [12%] in cohort 2). Two individuals in cohort 2 died due to adverse events, one from dyspnoea and one from multiorgan failure, but neither was treatment related. Serious adverse events were reported for 16 (62%) of 26 patients in cohort 1 and 17 (68%) of 25 patients in cohort 2.

"Correlative analyses of RET and RAS mutations in a phase 3 trial of cabozantinib in patients with progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer.",Cancer,Cancer,2016-08-15,"Cabozantinib significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus a placebo in patients with progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC; P < .001). An exploratory analysis of phase 3 trial data evaluated the influence of rearranged during transfection (RET) and RAS (HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS) mutations on cabozantinib clinical activity. Patients (n = 330) were randomized to cabozantinib (140 mg/day) or a placebo. The primary endpoint was PFS. Additional outcome measures included PFS, objective response rates (ORRs), and adverse events in RET and RAS mutation subgroups. Among all study patients, 51.2% were RET mutation-positive (38.2% with RET M918T), 34.8% were RET mutation-unknown, and 13.9% were RET mutation-negative. Sixteen patients were RAS mutation-positive. Cabozantinib appeared to prolong PFS versus the placebo in the RET mutation-positive subgroup (hazard ratio [HR], 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.14-0.38; P < .0001), the RET mutation-unknown subgroup (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.16-0.57; P = .0001), and the RAS mutation-positive subgroup (HR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.02-1.10; P = .0317). The RET M918T subgroup achieved the greatest observed PFS benefit from cabozantinib versus the placebo (HR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.08-0.28; P < .0001). The ORRs for RET mutation-positive, RET mutation-negative, and RAS mutation-positive patients were 32%, 22%, and 31%, respectively. No PFS benefit was observed in patients lacking both RET and RAS mutations, although the ORR was 21%. The safety profile for all subgroups was similar to that for the overall cabozantinib arm. These data suggest that cabozantinib provides the greatest clinical benefit to patients with MTC who have RET M918T or RAS mutations. However, a prospective trial is needed to confirm the relation between genetic variation and the response to cabozantinib.

However, the risk of secondary malignancies has increased, thought to be due to a combination of environmental and disease-related factors, as well as treatment. In the present review, we evaluate the risk of secondary malignancies in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), multiple myeloma (MM) and Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM). Patients with MGUS appear to have a higher risk of developing myeloid malignancies such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Characterization of Tumor Size Changes Over Time From the Phase 3 Study of Lenvatinib in Thyroid Cancer.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2016-08-22,"Lenvatinib improved the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate of patients with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer vs placebo in the Phase 3 Study of (E7080) Lenvatinib in Differentiated Cancer of the Thyroid (SELECT). The objective of the study was to characterize tumor size changes with lenvatinib treatment. SELECT was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. In this clinical trial, tumor assessments of lenvatinib (n = 261) and placebo-treated (n = 131) patients were performed by independent radiological review per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version, 1.1 at 8-week intervals. Patients with complete or partial response were defined as responders to lenvatinib (n = 169). Of the 92 nonresponders, 76 had at least one postbaseline tumor assessment and were included in this analysis. Lenvatinib (24 mg once daily) or placebo in 28-day cycles until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or death. This was an exploratory analysis of key end points from SELECT, including PFS, overall response rate, and tumor reduction. The median maximum percentage change in tumor size was -42.9% for patients receiving lenvatinib (responders, -51.9%; nonresponders, -20.2%). Tumor size reduction was most pronounced at first assessment (median, -24.7% at 8 wk after randomization); thereafter, the rate of change was slower but continuous (-1.3% per mo). In a multivariate model, percentage change in tumor size at the first assessment was a marginally significant positive predictor for PFS (P = .06).

Detection and Prognostic Significance of Circulating Tumor Cells in Patients With Metastatic Thyroid Cancer.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have been shown to be a valuable prognostic marker for other solid cancers. We hypothesized that CTCs are present in the blood of patients with advanced TC and their number can predict overall survival (OS). This is a prospective study at a tertiary cancer hospital. Patients, Interventions, and Main Outcome Measures: Initial studies were performed with TC cell lines to determine the feasibility of detection using the Veridex CellSearch. CTC enumeration was performed in blood samples from 18 patients with distantly metastatic medullary TC (metMTC), 14 with distantly metastatic differentiated TC (metDTC), and 10 controls with a history of TC but no evidence of disease. The prognostic value of CTC levels to predict OS in metMTC patients was assessed. CellSearch detected cells from MTC and DTC but not anaplastic TC cell lines. Six metMTC patients but no metDTC or control patients had more than or equal to 5 CTCs detected by the CellSearch assay. Median survival in metMTC patients with more than or equal to 5 CTCs was 13 months vs 51.5 months for those with less than 5 CTCs (P = .0116). The hazard ratio for mortality of patients with more than or equal to 5 CTCs compared with those with less than 5 CTCs was 3.95 (1.20-13.0, P = .0245).

Role of CDKN2C Copy Number in Sporadic Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2016-10-18,"The cyclin-dependent-kinase inhibitors (CDKN)/retinoblastoma (RB1) pathway has been implicated as having a role in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) tumorigenesis. CDKN2C loss has been associated with RET-mediated MTC in humans but with minimal phenotypic correlation provided. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between tumor RET mutation status, CDKN2C loss, and aggressiveness of MTC in a cohort of patients with sporadic disease. Tumors from patients with sporadic MTC treated at a single institution were evaluated for somatic RET<sup>M918T</sup> mutation and CDKN2C copy number loss. These variables were compared to patient demographics, pathology detail, clinical course, and disease-specific and overall survival. Sixty-two MTC cases with an initial surgery date ranging from 1983 to 2009 met the inclusion criteria, of whom 36 (58%) were male. The median age at initial surgery was 53 years (range 22-81 years). The median tumor size was 30 mm (range 6-145 mm) with 29 (57%) possessing extrathyroidal extension. Nodal and/or distant metastasis at presentation was found in 47/60 (78%) and 12/61 (20%) patients, respectively. Median follow-up time was 10.5 years (range 1.1-27.8 years) for the censored observations. The presence of CDKN2C loss was associated with worse M stage and overall AJCC stage. Median overall survival of patients with versus without CDKN2C loss was 4.14 [confidence interval (CI) 1.93-NA] versus 18.27 [CI 17.24-NA] years (p < 0.0001). Median overall survival of patients with a combined somatic RET<sup>M918T</sup> mutation and CDKN2C loss versus no somatic RET<sup>M918T</sup> mutation and CDKN2C loss versus somatic RET<sup>M918T</sup> mutation and CDKN2C 2N versus no somatic RET<sup>M918T</sup> mutation and CDKN2C 2N was 2.38 [CI 1.67-NA] years versus 10.81 [CI 2.46-NA] versus 17.24 [CI 9.82-NA] versus not reached [CI 13.46-NA] years (p < 0.0001). The detection of somatic CDKN2C loss is associated with the presence of distant metastasis at presentation as well decreased overall survival, a relationship enhanced by concomitant RET<sup>M918T</sup> mutation.

Bone Metastases and Skeletal-Related Events in Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2016-09-23,"Bone metastases (BM) can lead to devastating skeletal-related events (SREs) in cancer patients. Data regarding medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) with BM are lacking. We evaluated the natural history of BM and SREs in MTC patients identified by a cancer center tumor registry. The study was conducted at a tertiary cancer center. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of MTC patients with BM who received care from 1991 to 2014 to characterize BM and SREs. Of 1008 MTC patients treated, 188 were confirmed to have BM (19%), of whom 89% (168 of 188) had nonosseous distant metastases. Median time from MTC to BM diagnosis was 30.9 months (range 0-533 mo); 25% (45 of 180) had BM identified within 3 months of MTC diagnosis. Median follow-up after detecting BM was 1.6 years (range 0-23.2 y). Most patients (77%) had six or more BM lesions, most often affecting the spine (92%) and pelvis (69%). Many patients (90 of 188, 48%) experienced one or more SREs, most commonly radiotherapy (67 of 90, 74%) followed by pathological fracture (21 of 90, 23%). Only three patients had spinal cord compression. Patients with more than 10 BM lesions were more likely to experience SREs (odds ratio 2.4; P = .007), with no difference in 5-year mortality after MTC diagnosis between patients with (31%) and without SREs (23%) (P = .11).

Sustained ERK inhibition maximizes responses of BrafV600E thyroid cancers to radioiodine.,The Journal of clinical investigation,J. Clin. Invest.,2016-09-26,"Radioiodide (RAI) therapy of thyroid cancer exploits the relatively selective ability of thyroid cells to transport and accumulate iodide. Iodide uptake requires expression of critical genes that are involved in various steps of thyroid hormone biosynthesis. ERK signaling, which is markedly increased in thyroid cancer cells driven by oncogenic BRAF, represses the genetic program that enables iodide transport. Here, we determined that a critical threshold for inhibition of MAPK signaling is required to optimally restore expression of thyroid differentiation genes in thyroid cells and in mice with BrafV600E-induced thyroid cancer. Although the MEK inhibitor selumetinib transiently inhibited ERK signaling, which subsequently rebounded, the MEK inhibitor CKI suppressed ERK signaling in a sustained manner by preventing RAF reactivation. A small increase in ERK inhibition markedly increased the expression of thyroid differentiation genes, increased iodide accumulation in cancer cells, and thereby improved responses to RAI therapy. Only a short exposure to the drug was necessary to obtain a maximal response to RAI. These data suggest that potent inhibition of ERK signaling is required to adequately induce iodide uptake and indicate that this is a promising strategy for the treatment of BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer.",Journal Article,1212.0,42.0,Radioiodide RAI therapy of cancer exploits the relatively selective ability of cells to transport and accumulate iodide Iodide uptake requires expression of critical genes that are involved in various steps of hormone biosynthesis ERK signaling which is markedly increased in cancer cells driven by oncogenic BRAF represses the genetic program that enables iodide transport Here we determined that a critical threshold for inhibition of MAPK signaling is required to optimally restore expression of differentiation genes in cells and in mice with BrafV600E-induced cancer Although the MEK inhibitor selumetinib transiently inhibited ERK signaling which subsequently rebounded the MEK inhibitor CKI suppressed ERK signaling in a sustained manner by preventing RAF reactivation A small increase in ERK inhibition markedly increased the expression of differentiation genes increased iodide accumulation in cancer cells and thereby improved responses to RAI therapy Only a short exposure to the drug was necessary to obtain a maximal response to RAI These data suggest that potent inhibition of ERK signaling is required to adequately induce iodide uptake and indicate that this is a promising strategy for the treatment of BRAF-mutant cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[31044, 4121, 36, 1, 12, 15213, 3, 1352, 1094, 801, 1, 37, 6, 4294, 2, 7859, 8456, 8456, 1135, 1706, 55, 1, 740, 214, 17, 32, 646, 4, 747, 4022, 1, 785, 6225, 1819, 314, 92, 16, 2195, 101, 4, 12, 37, 1621, 20, 1302, 566, 10946, 3, 336, 1243, 17, 4843, 8456, 4294, 467, 21, 509, 17, 8, 740, 2390, 9, 297, 1, 1748, 314, 16, 616, 6, 5074, 6075, 55, 1, 910, 214, 4, 37, 2, 4, 399, 5, 9315, 277, 12, 242, 3, 1693, 230, 4626, 9235, 879, 1819, 314, 92, 1611, 33818, 3, 1693, 230, 32659, 1908, 1819, 314, 4, 8, 2275, 1708, 20, 3017, 2212, 3834, 8, 302, 344, 4, 1819, 297, 2195, 101, 3, 55, 1, 910, 214, 101, 8456, 1835, 4, 12, 37, 2, 2267, 231, 253, 6, 4121, 36, 158, 8, 978, 645, 6, 3, 234, 10, 1493, 6, 3140, 8, 2725, 51, 6, 4121, 46, 74, 309, 17, 1157, 297, 1, 1819, 314, 16, 616, 6, 4215, 1290, 8456, 1135, 2, 1008, 17, 26, 16, 8, 721, 692, 9, 3, 24, 1, 566, 620, 12]",1238.0,27669459,393
Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma Associated with Germline RET<sup>K666N</sup> Mutation.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2016-10-18,"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is an autosomal dominant inherited syndrome caused by activating mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. The RET<sup>K666N</sup> DNA variant was previously reported in two isolated medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) cases, but no family studies are available, and its oncogenic significance remains unknown. The clinical features, genetic data, and family information of eight index MTC patients with a germline RET<sup>K666N</sup> variant were assessed. Four probands presented with MTC and extensive nodal metastasis, one with biopsy-confirmed distant metastasis. Two additional probands presented with localized disease. However, nodal status was not available. Of the final two probands, one had an incidental 1.5 mm MTC and C-cell hyperplasia uncovered after surgery for papillary thyroid carcinoma, and one had two foci of MTC (largest dimension 2.3 cm) detected after surgery for dysphagia. Genetic screening identified 16 additional family members carrying the K666N variant (aged 5-90 years), 11 of whom have documented evaluation for MTC. Of these, only two were found to have elevated basal serum calcitonin upon screening, and the remaining patients had calcitonin levels within the reference range. One patient who elected to have a thyroidectomy at 70 years of age was confirmed to have MTC. The other subject, 57 years old, elected surveillance. Four prophylactic thyroidectomies were performed, with one case of C-cell hyperplasia at 20 years and three cases that revealed normal pathology at ages 21, 30, and 30 years. None of the K666N DNA variant carriers had evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism or pheochromocytoma. From this case series, the largest such experience to date, it is concluded that the RET<sup>K666N</sup> variant is likely pathogenic and associated with low penetrance of MTC. However, the findings are insufficient to define its pathogenicity clearly and make firm recommendations for screening and treatment. Given the potential benefit associated with early detection of aberrant C-cell growth, and the noninvasive nature of genetic testing, ""at risk"" individuals should be screened, and if the K666N variant is identified, they should be managed using a personalized screening approach for detection of MTC.",Journal Article,1190.0,5.0,Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is an autosomal dominant inherited syndrome caused by activating mutations in the RET proto-oncogene The RET sup K666N /sup DNA variant was previously reported in two isolated medullary carcinoma MTC cases but no family studies are available and its oncogenic significance remains unknown The clinical features genetic data and family information of eight index MTC patients with a germline RET sup K666N /sup variant were assessed Four probands presented with MTC and extensive nodal metastasis one with biopsy-confirmed distant metastasis Two additional probands presented with localized disease However nodal status was not available Of the final two probands one had an incidental 1.5 mm MTC and C-cell hyperplasia uncovered after surgery for papillary carcinoma and one had two foci of MTC largest dimension 2.3 cm detected after surgery for dysphagia Genetic screening identified 16 additional family members carrying the K666N variant aged 5-90 years 11 of whom have documented evaluation for MTC Of these only two were found to have elevated basal serum calcitonin upon screening and the remaining patients had calcitonin levels within the reference range One patient who elected to have a thyroidectomy at 70 years of age was confirmed to have MTC The other subject 57 years old elected surveillance Four prophylactic thyroidectomies were performed with one case of C-cell hyperplasia at 20 years and three cases that revealed normal pathology at ages 21 30 and 30 years None of the K666N DNA variant carriers had evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism or From this case series the largest such experience to date it is concluded that the RET sup K666N /sup variant is likely pathogenic and associated with low penetrance of MTC However the findings are insufficient to define its pathogenicity clearly and make firm recommendations for screening and treatment Given the potential benefit associated with early detection of aberrant C-cell growth and the noninvasive nature of genetic testing `` at risk '' individuals should be screened and if the K666N variant is identified they should be managed using a personalized screening approach for detection of MTC,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[232, 1293, 2298, 267, 18, 16, 35, 6084, 2156, 2986, 681, 1546, 20, 1616, 138, 4, 3, 2412, 4976, 1836, 3, 2412, 172, 20096, 172, 261, 1142, 10, 373, 210, 4, 100, 1355, 4564, 134, 3959, 140, 84, 77, 607, 94, 32, 390, 2, 211, 1302, 724, 469, 860, 3, 38, 404, 336, 74, 2, 607, 487, 1, 659, 558, 3959, 7, 5, 8, 1009, 2412, 172, 20096, 172, 1142, 11, 275, 294, 4916, 917, 5, 3959, 2, 1344, 779, 278, 104, 5, 411, 557, 626, 278, 100, 402, 4916, 917, 5, 909, 34, 137, 779, 156, 10, 44, 390, 1, 3, 1457, 100, 4916, 104, 42, 35, 4490, 14, 33, 321, 3959, 2, 256, 31, 3176, 5601, 50, 152, 9, 1796, 134, 2, 104, 42, 100, 3340, 1, 3959, 2166, 6384, 18, 27, 494, 530, 50, 152, 9, 4561, 336, 453, 108, 245, 402, 607, 1684, 2934, 3, 20096, 1142, 1032, 33, 424, 60, 175, 1, 953, 47, 1405, 451, 9, 3959, 1, 46, 158, 100, 11, 204, 6, 47, 804, 2135, 524, 11314, 1548, 453, 2, 3, 1844, 7, 42, 11314, 148, 262, 3, 2482, 184, 104, 69, 54, 9164, 6, 47, 8, 5949, 28, 431, 60, 1, 89, 10, 557, 6, 47, 3959, 3, 127, 2974, 696, 60, 1095, 9164, 617, 294, 1862, 40178, 11, 173, 5, 104, 473, 1, 256, 31, 3176, 28, 179, 60, 2, 169, 140, 17, 553, 295, 1117, 28, 2165, 239, 201, 2, 201, 60, 1292, 1, 3, 20096, 261, 1142, 1316, 42, 241, 1, 86, 9630, 15, 29, 26, 473, 988, 3, 2166, 225, 730, 6, 1244, 192, 16, 4724, 17, 3, 2412, 172, 20096, 172, 1142, 16, 322, 2806, 2, 41, 5, 154, 4792, 1, 3959, 137, 3, 272, 32, 3027, 6, 1107, 211, 8349, 2536, 2, 2378, 10851, 883, 9, 453, 2, 24, 447, 3, 174, 247, 41, 5, 191, 638, 1, 1898, 256, 31, 129, 2, 3, 2957, 2202, 1, 336, 471, 28, 43, 522, 869, 257, 40, 2261, 2, 492, 3, 20096, 1142, 16, 108, 491, 257, 40, 2231, 75, 8, 2175, 453, 353, 9, 638, 1, 3959]",2206.0,27673361,448

Cancer Res.,2016-09-28,"<b>Purpose:</b> Aberrations in genetic sequences encoding the tyrosine kinase receptor RET lead to oncogenic signaling that is targetable with anti-RET multikinase inhibitors. Understanding the comprehensive genomic landscape of <i>RET</i> aberrations across multiple cancers may facilitate clinical trial development targeting <i>RET</i><b>Experimental Design:</b> We interrogated the molecular portfolio of 4,871 patients with diverse malignancies for the presence of <i>RET</i> aberrations using Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified targeted next-generation sequencing of 182 or 236 gene panels.<b>Results:</b> Among diverse cancers, <i>RET</i> aberrations were identified in 88 cases [1.8% (88/4, 871)], with mutations being the most common alteration [38.6% (34/88)], followed by fusions [30.7% (27/88), including a novel <i>SQSTM1-RET</i>] and amplifications [25% (22/88)]. Most patients had coexisting aberrations in addition to <i>RET</i> anomalies [81.8% (72/88)], with the most common being in <i>TP53</i>-associated genes [59.1% (52/88)], cell cycle-associated genes [39.8% (35/88)], the PI3K signaling pathway [30.7% (27/88)], MAPK effectors [22.7% (20/88)], or other tyrosine kinase families [21.6% (19/88)]. <i>RET</i> fusions were mutually exclusive with MAPK signaling pathway alterations.

Percutaneous surgery for treatment of epidural spinal cord compression and spinal instability: technical note.,Neurosurgical focus,Neurosurg Focus,2016-10-01,"OBJECTIVE An emerging paradigm for treating patients with epidural spinal cord compression (ESCC) caused by metastatic tumors is surgical decompression and stabilization, followed by stereotactic radiosurgery. In the setting of rapid progressive disease, interruption or delay in return to systemic treatment can lead to a negative impact in overall survival. To overcome this limitation, the authors introduce the use of spinal laser interstitial thermotherapy (sLITT) in association with percutaneous spinal stabilization to facilitate a rapid return to oncological treatment. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed a consecutive series of patients with ESCC and spinal instability who were considered to be poor surgical candidates and instead were treated with sLITT and percutaneous spinal stabilization. Demographic data, Spine Instability Neoplastic Scale score, degree of epidural compression before and after the procedure, length of hospital stay, and time to return to oncological treatment were analyzed. RESULTS Eight patients were treated with thermal ablation and percutaneous spinal stabilization. The primary tumors included melanoma (n = 3), lung (n = 3), thyroid (n = 1), and renal cell carcinoma (n = 1). The median Karnofsky Performance Scale score before and after the procedure was 60, and the median hospital stay was 5 days (range 3-18 days). The median Spine Instability Neoplastic Scale score was 13 (range 12-16). The mean modified postoperative ESCC score (2.75 ± 0.37) was significantly lower than the preoperative score (4.5 ± 0.27) (Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.0044). The median time to return to oncological treatment was 5 days (range 3-10 days).

Clinical significance of sunitinib-associated macrocytosis in metastatic renal cell carcinoma.,Cancer medicine,Cancer Med,2016-10-19,"Increases in the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) have been observed in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) on tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment; however, its association with progression-free-survival (PFS) is unknown. We aimed to characterize TKI-associated macrocytosis in mRCC and its relationship with PFS. Retrospective review of data on macrocytosis and thyroid dysfunction on mRCC patients treated with sunitinib and/or sorafenib. These results are evaluated in the context of our previous report on the association of hypothyroidism in this setting. We assessed PFS as clinically defined by the treating physician. Seventy-four patients, 29 of whom received both drugs, were included. A treatment period was defined as time from initiation to discontinuation of either sunitinib or sorafenib; 103 treatment periods [sorafenib (47), sunitinib (56)] were analyzed. Macrocytosis was found in 55 and 8% of sunitinib- and sorafenib-treated patients, respectively, P < 0.001. The median time to developing macrocytosis was 3 months (m, range 1-7). Median PFS in sunitinib-treated patients was 11 m (95% CI: 6-19). Median PFS was higher among those with macrocytosis compared to normocytosis (21 m [95% CI: 11-25] vs. 4 m [95% CI: 3-8] P = 0.0001). Macrocytosis and hypothyroidism were two significant predictors of PFS. The greatest difference in PFS among all patients was observed in patients with both macrocytosis and hypothyroidism (25 m), compared to the normocytic and euthyroid patients (5 m) (P < 0.0001). Sunitinib-related macrocytosis was associated with prolonged PFS, and concurrent development of hypothyroidism and macrocytosis further prolonged PFS.

Real-Time Genomic Characterization Utilizing Circulating Cell-Free DNA in Patients with Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2016-11-29,"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is an aggressive disease that requires rapid diagnosis and multimodality treatment. Recent advances in targeted therapeutics have provided ATC patients with previously unavailable treatment options, which may improve clinical outcomes in the coming years. Continued development of high-throughput next-generation sequencing provides clinicians with an unparalleled ability to characterize the genomic background of tumors in order to guide treatment selection and clinical trial enrollment. Twenty-three patients with ATC treated at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center between August 2015 and April 2016 were evaluated. All patients underwent next-generation sequencing using an institutional tissue-based DNA platform (50 genes) and a commercially available cell-free circulating DNA (cfDNA) platform (70 genes). Sequencing data were successfully obtained for both platforms on all patients. The most commonly mutated genes noted on both platforms were TP53 (15/23; 65%) and BRAF (11/23; 48%). Concordance between the tumor and cfDNA data was high for BRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS, and PTEN and moderate for TP53. Concordance was highest in patients who underwent dual-platform sequencing prior to initiation of definitive treatment, and lowest in patients who underwent cfDNA analysis following treatment. Nineteen patients had treatment at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center following cfDNA sequencing. One patient was observed, and three patients opted for hospice. At the time of last contact, 15/23 (65%) patients were alive. Next-generation sequencing platforms offer clinicians an opportunity to identify targetable oncogenic events in ATC.

An 11-year-old male with a history of metastatic tectal plate low-grade glioma who was diagnosed at age 2.8 years transferred his care to the long-term follow-up clinic. He completed treatment with multiagent chemotherapy-carboplatin, vincristine, temozolomide, procarbazine, lomustine, and thioguanine-at age 4.5 years and did not require radiotherapy. At primary diagnosis, he presented with hydrocephalus that required ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement, with a subsequent shunt revision at age 6 years. Residual metastatic tumors in the third and fourth ventricles and in the suprasellar region remained stable for more than 5 years. The patient achieved normal developmental milestones and was not taking medications. He was offered screening for hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) dysfunction because of his suprasellar lesion. His height was at the 25th percentile for chronological age, with decline from the 50th percentile noted during the preceding 18 months ( Fig 1 , point c).

Antitumor Activity of RXDX-105 in Multiple Cancer Types with <i>RET</i> Rearrangements or Mutations.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2016-12-23,"<b>Purpose:</b> While multikinase inhibitors with RET activity are active in <i>RET</i>-rearranged thyroid and lung cancers, objective response rates are relatively low and toxicity can be substantial. The development of novel RET inhibitors with improved potency and/or reduced toxicity is thus an unmet need. RXDX-105 is a small molecule kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits RET. The purpose of the preclinical and clinical studies was to evaluate the potential of RXDX-105 as an effective therapy for cancers driven by <i>RET</i> alterations.<b>Experimental design:</b> The RET-inhibitory activity of RXDX-105 was assessed by biochemical and cellular assays, followed by <i>in vivo</i> tumor growth inhibition studies in cell line- and patient-derived xenograft models. Antitumor activity in patients was assessed by imaging and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).<b>Results:</b> Biochemically, RXDX-105 inhibited wild-type RET, CCDC6-RET, NCOA4-RET, PRKAR1A-RET, and RET M918T with low to subnanomolar activity while sparing VEGFR2/KDR and VEGFR1/FLT. RXDX-105 treatment resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation of <i>CCDC6-RET</i>-rearranged and RET C634W-mutant cell lines and inhibition of downstream signaling pathways. Significant tumor growth inhibition in <i>CCDC6-RET, NCOA4-RET</i>, and <i>KIF5B-RET-</i>containing xenografts was observed, with the concomitant inhibition of p-ERK, p-AKT, and p-PLCγ. Additionally, a patient with advanced <i>RET</i>-rearranged lung cancer had a rapid and sustained response to RXDX-105 in both intracranial and extracranial disease.<b>Conclusions:</b> These data support the inclusion of patients bearing <i>RET</i> alterations in ongoing and future molecularly enriched clinical trials to explore RXDX-105 efficacy across a variety of tumor types. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(12); 2981-90. ©2016 AACR</i>.",Journal Article,1124.0,27.0,b Purpose /b While multikinase inhibitors with RET activity are active in i RET /i -rearranged and cancers objective response rates are relatively low and toxicity can be substantial The development of novel RET inhibitors with improved potency and/or reduced toxicity is thus an unmet need RXDX-105 is a small molecule kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits RET The purpose of the preclinical and clinical studies was to evaluate the potential of RXDX-105 as an effective therapy for cancers driven by i RET /i alterations. b Experimental design /b The RET-inhibitory activity of RXDX-105 was assessed by biochemical and cellular assays followed by i in vivo /i tumor growth inhibition studies in cell line- and patient-derived xenograft models Antitumor activity in patients was assessed by imaging and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors RECIST b Results /b Biochemically RXDX-105 inhibited wild-type RET CCDC6-RET NCOA4-RET PRKAR1A-RET and RET M918T with low to subnanomolar activity while sparing VEGFR2/KDR and VEGFR1/FLT RXDX-105 treatment resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation of i CCDC6-RET /i -rearranged and RET C634W-mutant cell lines and inhibition of downstream signaling pathways Significant tumor growth inhibition in i CCDC6-RET NCOA4-RET /i and i KIF5B-RET- /i containing xenografts was observed with the concomitant inhibition of p-ERK p-AKT and p-PLCγ Additionally a patient with advanced i RET /i -rearranged cancer had a rapid and sustained response to RXDX-105 in both intracranial and extracranial disease. b Conclusions /b These data support the inclusion of patients bearing i RET /i alterations in ongoing and future molecularly enriched clinical trials to explore RXDX-105 efficacy across a variety of tumor types i Clin Cancer Res 23 12 2981-90 ©2016 AACR /i,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[132, 743, 132, 369, 6524, 222, 5, 2412, 128, 32, 544, 4, 70, 2412, 70, 3201, 2, 163, 461, 51, 151, 32, 1352, 154, 2, 155, 122, 40, 1281, 3, 193, 1, 229, 2412, 222, 5, 231, 3593, 2, 15, 405, 155, 16, 631, 35, 3715, 594, 22865, 3263, 16, 8, 302, 1354, 216, 230, 17, 4684, 1576, 2412, 3, 743, 1, 3, 693, 2, 38, 94, 10, 6, 376, 3, 174, 1, 22865, 3263, 22, 35, 323, 36, 9, 163, 1621, 20, 70, 2412, 70, 593, 132, 1560, 771, 132, 3, 2412, 1810, 128, 1, 22865, 3263, 10, 275, 20, 1487, 2, 763, 1013, 370, 20, 70, 4, 386, 70, 30, 129, 297, 94, 4, 31, 328, 2, 69, 526, 1330, 274, 579, 128, 4, 7, 10, 275, 20, 270, 2, 51, 451, 371, 4, 537, 57, 1834, 132, 99, 132, 7944, 22865, 3263, 879, 955, 267, 2412, 17048, 2412, 19921, 2412, 22454, 2412, 2, 2412, 14704, 5, 154, 6, 50156, 128, 369, 1851, 4609, 8513, 2, 7952, 4368, 22865, 3263, 24, 627, 4, 61, 470, 297, 1, 457, 1, 70, 17048, 2412, 70, 3201, 2, 2412, 34550, 620, 31, 285, 2, 297, 1, 1489, 314, 460, 93, 30, 129, 297, 4, 70, 17048, 2412, 19921, 2412, 70, 2, 70, 17504, 2412, 70, 1101, 1348, 10, 164, 5, 3, 1781, 297, 1, 19, 1819, 19, 649, 2, 19, 48974, 1724, 8, 69, 5, 131, 70, 2412, 70, 3201, 12, 42, 8, 1321, 2, 2275, 51, 6, 22865, 3263, 4, 110, 2089, 2, 4202, 34, 132, 2130, 132, 46, 74, 538, 3, 1680, 1, 7, 1894, 70, 2412, 70, 593, 4, 942, 2, 508, 2372, 2220, 38, 143, 6, 1645, 22865, 3263, 209, 716, 8, 1362, 1, 30, 630, 70, 2459, 12, 1936, 382, 133, 36353, 424, 3456, 1630, 70]",1814.0,28011461,342

Radiation therapy dose is associated with improved survival for unresected anaplastic thyroid carcinoma: Outcomes from the National Cancer Data Base.,Cancer,Cancer,2016-12-27,"The outcomes of patients with unresected anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) from the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) were assessed, and potential correlations were explored between radiation therapy (RT) dose and overall survival (OS). The study cohort was comprised of patients who underwent either no surgery or grossly incomplete resection. Correlates of OS were explored using univariate analysis and multivariable analysis (MVA). In total, 1288 patients were analyzed. The mean patient age was 70.2 years, 59.7% of patients were women, and 47.6% received neck RT. The median OS was 2.27 months, and 11% of patients remained alive at 1 year. A positive RT dose-survival correlation was observed for the entire study cohort, for those who received systemic therapy, and for those with stage IVA/IVB and IVC disease. On MVA, older age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.317; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.137-1.526), ≥ 1 comorbidity (HR, 1.587; 95% CI, 1.379-1.827), distant metastasis (HR, 1.385; 95% CI, 1.216-1.578), receipt of systemic therapy (HR, 0.637; 95% CI, 0.547-0.742), and receipt of RT compared with no RT (<45 grays [Gy]:HR, 0.843; 95% CI, 0.718-0.988; 45-59.9 Gy: HR, 0.596; 95% CI, 0.479-0.743; 60-75 Gy: HR, 0.419; 95% CI, 0.339-0.517) correlated with OS. The RT dose-survival correlation for patients who received higher (60-75 Gy) versus lower (45-59.9 Gy) therapeutic doses was confirmed by propensity-score matching. Survival was poor in this cohort of patients with unresected ATC, and more effective therapies are needed. However, the association of RT dose with OS highlights the importance of identifying patients with unresected ATC who may still yet benefit from multimodal locoregional treatment that incorporates higher dose RT.

Screening for thyroid cancer in survivors of childhood and young adult cancer treated with neck radiation.,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,J Cancer Surviv,2016-12-27,"The optimal method of screening for thyroid cancer in survivors of childhood and young adult cancer exposed to neck radiation remains controversial. Outcome data for a physical exam-based screening approach are lacking. We conducted a retrospective review of adult survivors of childhood and young adult cancer with a history of neck radiation followed in the Adult Long-Term Follow-Up Clinic at Memorial Sloan Kettering between November 2005 and August 2014. Eligible patients underwent a physical exam of the thyroid and were followed for at least 1 year afterwards. Ineligible patients were those with prior diagnosis of benign or malignant thyroid nodules. During a median follow-up of 3.1 years (range 0-9.4 years), 106 ultrasounds and 2277 physical exams were performed among 585 patients. Forty survivors had an abnormal thyroid physical exam median of 21 years from radiotherapy; 50% of those with an abnormal exam were survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, 60% had radiation at ages 10-19, and 53% were female. Ultimately, 24 underwent fine needle aspiration (FNA). Surgery revealed papillary carcinoma in seven survivors; six are currently free of disease and one with active disease is undergoing watchful waiting. Among those with one or more annual visits, representing 1732 person-years of follow-up, no cases of thyroid cancer were diagnosed within a year of normal physical exam.

Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of osseous spine metastasis before and 1 hour after high-dose image-guided radiation therapy.,Neurosurgical focus,Neurosurg Focus,2017-01-01,"OBJECTIVE High-dose image-guided radiation therapy (HD IGRT) has been instrumental in mitigating some limitations of conventional RT. The recent emergence of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI to investigate tumor physiology can be used to verify the response of human tumors to HD IGRT. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the near-immediate effects of HD IGRT on spine metastases through the use of DCE MRI perfusion studies. METHODS Six patients with spine metastases from prostate, thyroid, and renal cell carcinoma who underwent HD IGRT were studied using DCE MRI prior to and 1 hour after HD IGRT. The DCE perfusion parameters plasma volume (V<sub>p</sub>) and vascular permeability (K<sub>trans</sub>) were measured to assess the near-immediate and long-term tumor response. A Mann-Whitney U-test was performed to compare significant changes (at p ≤ 0.05) in perfusion parameters before and after RT. RESULTS The authors observed a precipitous drop in V<sub>p</sub> within 1 hour of HD IGRT, with a mean decrease of 65.2%. A significant difference was found between V<sub>p</sub> values for before and 1 hour after RT (p ≤ 0.05). No significant change was seen in V<sub>p</sub> (p = 0.31) and K<sub>trans</sub> (p = 0.1) from 1 hour after RT to the first follow-up. CONCLUSIONS The data suggest that there is an immediate effect of HD IGRT on the vascularity of spine metastases, as demonstrated by a precipitous decrease in V<sub>p</sub>.

Patterns of Treatment Failure in Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2017-02-16,"Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is one of the most lethal forms of cancer with a high mortality rate. Current guidelines support surgery for resectable ATC followed by external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with or without chemotherapy. Treatment for those who are unresectable is palliative. Our goal was to examine first-line therapies as well as the role of genomic profiling in an effort better understand how to approach ATC. This is a retrospective study of ATC patients who were seen at our institution from January 2013 to October 2015. Median overall survival (OS) and time to treatment failure (TTF) were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Fifty-four patients were included. Median age at diagnosis was 63 years and 29/54 (54%) were women. The majority had stage IVC disease at diagnosis (50%), followed by IVB (32%), and IVA (18%). Approximately 93% had somatic gene testing. Initial treatment was surgery in 23 patients, EBRT with or without radiosensitizing chemotherapy in 29 patients, and systemic chemotherapy in 2 patients. Nineteen patients had all three treatment modalities. For the entire cohort, median OS was 11.9 months with 39% survival at 1 year and median TTF was 3.8 months. The majority of patients (74%) developed new distant metastasis or progression of existing metastatic disease. Patients who received trimodal therapy consisting of surgery, EBRT, and chemotherapy had a median OS of 22.1 months versus 6.5 months in those who received dual therapy with EBRT and chemotherapy (p = 0.0008). The TTF was the same in the two groups (7.0 and 6.5 months, respectively). Men were three times more likely to die from ATC than women (p = 0.0024). No differences in OS or TTF were noted based on tumor size (5 cm cutoff), age (60 years cutoff), or presence of any mutation. There was a trend toward shorter TTF in patients with somatic mutations in TP53. Patients with ATC amenable to aggressive tri-modal therapy demonstrate improved survival.

Insertions and Deletions Target Lineage-Defining Genes in Human Cancers.,Cell,Cell,2017-01-12,"Certain cell types function as factories, secreting large quantities of one or more proteins that are central to the physiology of the respective organ. Examples include surfactant proteins in lung alveoli, albumin in liver parenchyma, and lipase in the stomach lining. Whole-genome sequencing analysis of lung adenocarcinomas revealed noncoding somatic mutational hotspots near VMP1/MIR21 and indel hotspots in surfactant protein genes (SFTPA1, SFTPB, and SFTPC).

Cowden syndrome-associated germline succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit D (SDHD) variants cause PTEN-mediated down-regulation of autophagy in thyroid cancer cells.,Human molecular genetics,Hum. Mol. Genet.,2017-04-01,"Thyroid cancer is a major component cancer of Cowden syndrome (CS), a disorder typically associated with germline mutations in PTEN. Germline variants in succinate dehydrogenase genes (SDHx) co-occurring with PTEN germline mutations confer a 2-fold increased prevalence (OR 2.7) of thyroid cancer compared to PTEN-associated CS but 50% decreased prevalence (OR 0.54) of thyroid cancer compared to SDHx-associated CS. We have previously shown that CS-associated SDHD variants G12S and H50R induce PTEN oxidation and nuclear accumulation in thyroid cancer. Our current study shows that SDHD-G12S and -H50R variants cause down-regulation of autophagy, demonstrating a role for SDHD in autophagy-associated pathogenesis of differentiated thyroid cancer. These findings could explain the increased prevalence of thyroid cancer in CS patients with SDHx germline mutations compared to those with PTEN mutations alone. Importantly, we demonstrate the dependence of this process on functional wild-type PTEN with reversal of decreased autophagy after PTEN knockdown. The latter could explain the clinically observed decrease in thyroid cancer prevalence in patients with co-existent PTEN mutations and SDHx variants. We also show that SDHD-G12S/H50R promotes mono-ubiquitination of PTEN, causing its translocation into the nucleus, upregulation of AKT and consequent phosphorylation of FOXO3a. Furthermore, SDHD-G12S/H50R-mediated increase in acetylation of FOXO3a further enhances AKT-associated phosphorylation of FOXO3a. This combination of phosphorylation and acetylation of FOXO3a results in its nuclear export for degradation and consequent down-regulation of FOXO3a-target autophagy-related gene (ATG) expression.

"A cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, dinaciclib in preclinical treatment models of thyroid cancer.",PloS one,PLoS ONE,2017-02-16,"We explored the therapeutic effects of dinaciclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, in the treatment of thyroid cancer. Seven cell lines originating from three pathologic types of thyroid cancer (papillary, follicular and anaplastic) were studied. The cytotoxicity of dinaciclib was measured using a lactate dehydrogenase assay. The expression of proteins associated with cell cycle and apoptosis was assessed using Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy. Cell cycle distribution was measured by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy. Apoptosis and caspase-3 activity were measured by flow cytometry and fluorometric assay. Mice bearing flank anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) were treated with intraperitoneal injections of dinaciclib. Dinaciclib inhibited thyroid cancer cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Dinaciclib had a low median-effect dose (≤ 16.0 nM) to inhibit cell proliferation in seven thyroid cancer cell lines. Dinaciclib decreased CDK1, cyclin B1, and Aurora A expression, induced cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, and induced accumulation of prophase mitotic cells. Dinaciclib decreased Mcl-1, Bcl-xL and survivin expression, activated caspase-3 and induced apoptosis. In vivo, the growth of ATC xenograft tumors was retarded in a dose-dependent fashion with daily dinaciclib treatment. Higher-dose dinaciclib (50 mg/kg) caused slight, but significant weight loss, which was absent with lower-dose dinaciclib (40 mg/kg) treatment. Dinaciclib inhibited thyroid cancer proliferation both in vitro and in vivo.

Hybrid-capture-based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) was performed prospectively on 512 consecutively submitted thyroid carcinomas, including 58 from pediatric and AYA (PAYA) patients, to identify genomic alterations (GAs), including base substitutions, insertions/deletions, copy number alterations, and rearrangements. This PAYA data series includes 41 patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 3 with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), and 14 with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). GAs were detected in 93% (54/58) of PAYA cases, with a mean of 1.4 GAs per case. In addition to <i>BRAF</i> V600E mutations, detected in 46% (19/41) of PAYA PTC cases and in 1 of 3 AYA ATC cases, oncogenic fusions involving <i>RET</i>, <i>NTRK1</i>, <i>NTRK3</i>, and <i>ALK</i> were detected in 37% (15/41) of PAYA PTC and 33% (1/3) of AYA ATC cases. Ninety-three percent (13/14) of MTC patients harbored <i>RET</i> alterations, including 3 novel insertions/deletions in exons 6 and 11. Two of these MTC patients with novel alterations in <i>RET</i> experienced clinical benefit from vandetanib treatment. CGP identified diverse clinically relevant GAs in PAYA patients with thyroid carcinoma, including 83% (34/41) of PTC cases harboring activating kinase mutations or activating kinase rearrangements. These genomic observations and index cases exhibiting clinical benefit from targeted therapy suggest that young patients with advanced thyroid carcinoma can benefit from CGP and rationally matched targeted therapy. <b>

Longitudinal follow-up of adult survivors of Ewing sarcoma: A report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,Cancer,Cancer,2017-02-21,"Ewing sarcoma survivors (ESSs) are at increased risk for treatment-related complications. The incidence of treatment-related morbidity and late mortality with aging is unknown. This study reports survival probabilities, estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method, and the cumulative incidence of cause-specific mortality and chronic conditions among ESSs in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study who were treated between 1970 and 1986. Piecewise exponential models were used to estimate relative rates (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for these outcomes. Chronic conditions were graded with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). Among 404 5-year ESSs (median age at last follow-up, 34.8 years; range, 9.1-54.8 years), the 35-year survival rate was 70% (95% CI, 66%-74%). Late recurrence (cumulative incidence at 35 years, 15.1%) was the most common cause of death, and it was followed by treatment-related causes (11.2%). There were 53 patients with subsequent neoplasms (SNs; cumulative incidence at 35 years, 24.0%), and 38 were malignant (14.3% at 35 years). The standardized incidence ratios were 377.1 (95% CI, 172.1-715.9) for osteosarcoma, 28.9 (95% CI, 3.2-104.2) for acute myeloid leukemia, 14.9 (95% CI, 7.9-25.5) for breast cancer, and 13.1 (95% CI, 4.8-28.5) for thyroid cancer. Rates of chronic conditions were highest for musculoskeletal (RR, 18.1; 95% CI, 12.8-25.7) and cardiac complications (RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.4-2.3).

Exploratory analysis of biomarkers associated with clinical outcomes from the study of lenvatinib in differentiated cancer of the thyroid.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",Eur. J. Cancer,2017-02-24,"Lenvatinib significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus placebo in the phase III Study of (E7080) LEnvatinib in differentiated Cancer of the Thyroid (SELECT) of patients with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. This exploratory analysis investigated potential predictive biomarkers of lenvatinib efficacy and target engagement. Circulating cytokine/angiogenic factors (CAFs) in blood samples collected at baseline and throughout treatment were analysed from patients randomised to receive lenvatinib or placebo from August 5, 2011 to October 4, 2012. For CAF biomarker analyses, patients were dichotomised by baseline levels. Tumour tissues were analysed for BRAF and NRAS/KRAS/HRAS mutations. Tumours and CAFs were analysed from 183/392 (47%) and 387/392 (99%) patients, respectively. Lenvatinib PFS benefit was maintained in all assessments. For lenvatinib-treated patients, interaction-term analyses revealed that low baseline Ang2 level was predictive of tumour shrinkage (P<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.016) and PFS (P<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.018). Vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) were significantly upregulated with lenvatinib, and FGF23 upregulation on cycle 1/day 15 was associated with longer PFS. In mutation analyses, no significant differences in clinical outcomes were observed. BRAF<sup>WT</sup> may be a negative prognostic factor for PFS in placebo-treated patients with papillary thyroid cancer (P = 0.019). The lenvatinib PFS benefit was maintained regardless of baseline CAF or BRAF/RAS status. Baseline Ang2 was predictive of PFS in a subgroup of lenvatinib-treated patients, indicating that Ang2 may be predictive of lenvatinib sensitivity. BRAF<sup>WT</sup> may be a poor prognostic factor in patients with radioiodine-refractory papillary thyroid cancer. Improved PFS associated with upregulated FGF23 suggests that lenvatinib-induced FGF receptor inhibition contributes to lenvatinib efficacy.

"Temporal Trends in Treatment and Subsequent Neoplasm Risk Among 5-Year Survivors of Childhood Cancer, 1970-2015.",JAMA,JAMA,2017-02-01,"Cancer treatments are associated with subsequent neoplasms in survivors of childhood cancer. It is unknown whether temporal changes in therapy are associated with changes in subsequent neoplasm risk. To quantify the association between temporal changes in treatment dosing and subsequent neoplasm risk.

Radiation and chemotherapy dose changes over time. Subsequent neoplasm 15-year cumulative incidence, cumulative burden, and standardized incidence ratios for subsequent malignancies, compared by treatment decade. Multivariable models assessed relative rates (RRs) of subsequent neoplasms by 5-year increments, adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics. Mediation analyses assessed whether changes in rates of subsequent neoplasms over time were mediated by treatment variable modifications. Among 23 603 survivors of childhood cancer (mean age at diagnosis, 7.7 years; 46% female) the most common initial diagnoses were acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and astrocytoma. During a mean follow-up of 20.5 years (374 638 person-years at risk), 1639 survivors experienced 3115 subsequent neoplasms, including 1026 malignancies, 233 benign meningiomas, and 1856 nonmelanoma skin cancers. The most common subsequent malignancies were breast and thyroid cancers. Proportions of individuals receiving radiation decreased (77% for 1970s vs 33% for 1990s), as did median dose (30 Gy [interquartile range, 24-44] for 1970s vs 26 Gy [interquartile range, 18-45] for 1990s). Fifteen-year cumulative incidence of subsequent malignancies decreased by decade of diagnosis (2.1% [95% CI, 1.7%-2.4%] for 1970s, 1.7% [95% CI, 1.5%-2.0%] for 1980s, 1.3% [95% CI, 1.1%-1.5%] for 1990s). Reference absolute rates per 1000 person-years were 1.12 (95% CI, 0.84-1.57) for subsequent malignancies, 0.16 (95% CI, 0.06-0.41) for meningiomas, and 1.71 (95% CI, 0.88-3.33) for nonmelanoma skin cancers for survivors with reference characteristics (no chemotherapy, splenectomy, or radiation therapy; male; attained age 28 years). Standardized incidence ratios declined for subsequent malignancies over treatment decades, with advancing attained age. Relative rates declined with each 5-year increment for subsequent malignancies (RR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.82-0.93]; P < .001), meningiomas (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75-0.97]; P = .03), and nonmelanoma skin cancers (RR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.67-0.84]; P < .001). Radiation dose changes were associated with reduced risk for subsequent malignancies, meningiomas, and nonmelanoma skin cancers. Among survivors of childhood cancer, the risk of subsequent malignancies at 15 years after initial cancer diagnosis remained increased for those diagnosed in the 1990s, although the risk was lower compared with those diagnosed in the 1970s.

"Association between type 2 diabetes and risk of cancer mortality: a pooled analysis of over 771,000 individuals in the Asia Cohort Consortium.",Diabetologia,Diabetologia,2017-03-07,"The aims of the study were to evaluate the association between type 2 diabetes and the risk of death from any cancer and specific cancers in East and South Asians. Pooled analyses were conducted of 19 prospective population-based cohorts included in the Asia Cohort Consortium, comprising data from 658,611 East Asians and 112,686 South Asians. HRs were used to compare individuals with diabetes at baseline with those without diabetes for the risk of death from any cancer and from site-specific cancers, including cancers of the oesophagus, stomach, colorectum, colon, rectum, liver, bile duct, pancreas, lung, breast, endometrium, cervix, ovary, prostate, bladder, kidney and thyroid, as well as lymphoma and leukaemia. During a mean follow-up of 12.7 years, 37,343 cancer deaths (36,667 in East Asians and 676 in South Asians) were identified. Baseline diabetes status was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of death from any cancer (HR 1.26; 95% CI 1.21, 1.31). Significant positive associations with diabetes were observed for cancers of the colorectum (HR 1.41; 95% CI 1.26, 1.57), liver (HR 2.05; 95% CI 1.77, 2.38), bile duct (HR 1.41; 95% CI 1.04, 1.92), gallbladder (HR 1.33; 95% CI 1.10, 1.61), pancreas (HR 1.53; 95% CI 1.32, 1.77), breast (HR 1.72; 95% CI 1.34, 2.19), endometrium (HR 2.73; 95% CI 1.53, 4.85), ovary (HR 1.60; 95% CI 1.06, 2.42), prostate (HR 1.41; 95% CI 1.09, 1.82), kidney (HR 1.84; 95% CI 1.28, 2.64) and thyroid (HR 1.99; 95% CI 1.03, 3.86), as well as lymphoma (HR 1.39; 95% CI 1.04, 1.86). Diabetes was not statistically significantly associated with the risk of death from leukaemia and cancers of the bladder, cervix, oesophagus, stomach and lung.

Timing of multikinase inhibitor initiation in differentiated thyroid cancer.,Endocrine-related cancer,Endocr. Relat. Cancer,2017-03-07,"There are limited treatment options for patients with radioactive iodine refractory, progressive differentiated thyroid cancer. Although there is consensus that multikinase inhibitor therapy should be considered in patients with progressive disease with considerable tumor load or symptomatic disease, uncertainty exists on the optimal timing to treat with a multikinase inhibitor, especially for asymptomatic patients. RIFTOS MKI is an international, prospective, open-label, multicenter, noninterventional study with the primary objective to compare the time to symptomatic progression from study entry in asymptomatic patients with radioactive iodine refractory, progressive differentiated thyroid cancer for whom there is a decision to initiate multikinase inhibitors at study entry (cohort 1) with those for whom there is a decision to not initiate multikinase inhibitors at study entry (cohort 2). Secondary endpoints are overall survival and progression-free survival, which will be compared between cohorts 1 and 2. Additional secondary endpoints are postprogression survival from time of symptomatic progression, duration of and response to each systemic treatment regimen and dosing of sorafenib throughout the treatment period. Asymptomatic, multikinase inhibitor-naive patients aged ≥18 years with histologically/cytologically documented differentiated thyroid cancer that is radioactive iodine refractory are eligible. Patients may receive any therapy for differentiated thyroid cancer, including sorafenib or other multikinase inhibitors if indicated and decided on by the treating physician.

The inhibition of heat shock protein 90, which leads to the simultaneous degradation of multiple proteins involved in oncogenic signaling pathways, has revealed an innovative strategy to treat a variety of cancer types. We evaluated the therapeutic effects of ganetespib, a heat shock protein 90 inhibitor, in treating thyroid cancer. Ganetespib effectively inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in eight cell lines originating from four major histologic types of thyroid cancer (papillary, follicular, anaplastic and medullary). Ganetespib decreased cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and arrested cell cycle progression in G2/M phase. The expression of proteins involved in RAS/RAF/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways was also inhibited. The RET level was decreased in a medullary thyroid cancer cell line. Ganetespib increased Bim expression, activated caspase-3 and induced apoptosis. In vivo, ganetespib retarded the tumor growth of anaplastic and medullary thyroid cancer xenografts with acceptable safety profiles.

Racial Differences in 20-Year Cardiovascular Mortality Risk Among Childhood and Young Adult Cancer Survivors.,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,2017-05-22,"Whether cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk differs according to race and cancer type among survivors of childhood or young adulthood cancers is unknown. Data from the years 1973-2011 were analyzed using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries. Cases were categorized by ICD-0-3/WHO 2008 Adolescent and Young Adult classification. CVD death was determined by ICD-10 codes for diseases of the heart, atherosclerosis, cerebrovascular diseases, or other diseases of the arteries. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to evaluate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the effects of race on time-to-event outcomes. A total of 164,316 cases of childhood and young adult primary cancers were identified. There were 43,335 total and 1466 CVD deaths among Black and White survivors. Black survivors had higher risks of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.70-1.7) and CVD mortality (HR: 2.13, 95% CI: 1.85-2.46) compared to White survivors. The increased risk of CVD for Black survivors compared to White survivors persisted at 5-years (HR: 2.38, 95% CI: 1.83-3.10), 10-years (HR: 2.59, 95% CI: 2.09-3.21), and 20-years (HR: 2.31, 95% CI: 1.95-2.74) postdiagnosis, and varied by cancer type, with the highest HRs for melanoma (HR: 8.16, 95% CI: 1.99-33.45) and thyroid cancer (HR: 3.43, 95% CI: 1.75-6.73).

These mutation profiles were remarkably concordant with mutated cancer genes identified in a large series of human poorly differentiated and anaplastic thyroid cancers screened by next-generation sequencing using the MSK-IMPACT panel of cancer genes, which we modified to include all SB candidates. The disrupted genes primarily clustered in chromatin remodeling functional nodes and in the PI3K pathway. <i>ATXN7</i>, a component of a multiprotein complex with histone acetylase activity, scored as a significant SB hit.

Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma in MEN2A: ATA Moderate- or High-Risk RET Mutations Do Not Predict Disease Aggressiveness.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2017-08-01,"High-risk RET mutations (codon 634) are associated with earlier development of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and presumed increased aggressiveness compared with moderate-risk RET mutations. To determine whether high-risk RET mutations are more aggressive. Retrospective cohort study using institutional multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 registry. Tertiary cancer care center. Patients with MTC and moderate- or high-risk germline RET mutation. None (observational study). Proxies for aggressiveness were overall survival (OS) and time to distant metastatic disease (DMD). A total of 127 moderate-risk and 135 high-risk patients were included (n = 262). Median age at diagnosis was 42.3 years (range, 6.4 to 86.4 years; mean, 41.6 years) for moderate-risk mutations and 23.0 years (range, 3.7 to 66.8 years; mean, 25.6 years) for high-risk mutations (P < 0.0001). Moderate-risk patients had more T3/T4 tumors at diagnosis (P = 0.03), but there was no significant difference for N or M stage and no significant difference in OS (P = 0.40). From multivariable analysis for OS, increasing age [hazard ratio (HR), 1.05/y; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.08], T3/T4 tumor (HR, 2.73; 95% CI, 1.22 to 6.11), and M1 status at diagnosis (HR, 3.93; 95% CI, 1.61 to 9.59) were significantly associated with worse OS but high-risk mutation was not (P = 0.40). No significant difference was observed for development of DMD (P = 0.33). From multivariable analysis for DMD, only N1 status at diagnosis was significant (HR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.03 to 4.27). Patients with high- and moderate-risk RET mutations had similar OS and development of DMD after MTC diagnosis and therefore similarly aggressive clinical courses.

Effect of Age on the Efficacy and Safety of Lenvatinib in Radioiodine-Refractory Differentiated Thyroid Cancer in the Phase III SELECT Trial.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2017-06-14,"Purpose In the Study of (E7080) Lenvatinib in Differentiated Cancer of the Thyroid (SELECT), lenvatinib significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus placebo in patients with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC). This prespecified subanalysis investigated the effect of age on the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib. Patients and Methods This randomized, double-blind, phase III study enrolled patients with histologically confirmed RR-DTC stratified by age (≤ 65 or > 65 years). Patients (N = 392) received lenvatinib 24 mg/day (n = 261) or placebo (n = 131). The primary end point was PFS; secondary end points included overall survival (OS), objective response rate, and safety. Results In both treatment arms, median ages were 56 (younger group) and 71 years (older group). PFS benefit was maintained with lenvatinib versus placebo in the younger and older age groups, with median PFS of 20.2 versus 3.2 months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.19; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.27; P < .001) and 16.7 versus 3.7 months (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.43; P < .001), respectively. PFS did not differ with age in either treatment arm. OS was improved in older lenvatinib-treated patients versus placebo (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.91; P = .020).

Prognostic impact of TTF-1 expression in patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinomas.,"Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",Lung Cancer,2017-03-28,"Thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) is routinely tested in the diagnostic evaluation of suspected lung cancers, is commonly expressed by lung adenocarcinomas, and may modulate lung cancer biology. We examined the role of TTF-1 as a predictive and prognostic marker in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinomas. We analyzed clinical, pathologic, and molecular features, treatments received, and overall survival obtained from the medical records of 479 consecutive patients at a single site with stage IV lung adenocarcinomas and evaluable TTF-1 expression. TTF-1 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry using antibody 8G7G3/1. TTF-1 expression was evaluable in 479 (75%) of all patients reviewed, and was positive in 383 (80%, 95% CI 76-83%). Clinicopathologic features were similar between TTF-1 positive and TTF-1 negative tumors, except EGFR mutations were more common in TTF-1 positive cases (24% vs 6%, p<0.001). In univariate analysis, overall survival was significantly longer in patients with TTF-1 positive versus TTF-1 negative tumors (18 months vs 9 months, p<0.0001). In multivariate analysis, TTF-1 positivity remained associated with better overall survival (HR=0.38, p<0.0001), exceeding the prognostic impact of Karnofsky performance status >/=80% (HR 0.62, p=0.0003) and receipt of first-line combination chemotherapy or targeted therapy (HR relative to first-line single agent chemotherapy 0.59, p=0.05 and 0.51, p=0.05 respectively). Both patients with TTF-1 positive and TTF-1 negative cancers had longer durations of initial therapy when treated with pemetrexed-based chemotherapy.

Genomic Alterations in Fatal Forms of Non-Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer: Identification of <i>MED12</i> and <i>RBM10</i> as Novel Thyroid Cancer Genes Associated with Tumor Virulence.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2017-06-20,"<b>Purpose:</b> Patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) have a very high death rate. In contrast, deaths from non-anaplastic thyroid (NAT) cancer are much less common. The genetic alterations in fatal NAT cancers have not been reported.<b>Experimental Design:</b> We performed next-generation sequencing of 410 cancer genes from 57 fatal NAT primary cancers. Results were compared with The Cancer Genome Atlas study (TCGA study) of papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs) and to the genomic changes reported in ATC.<b>Results:</b> There was a very high prevalence of <i>TERT</i> promoter mutations, comparable with that of ATC, and these co-occurred with <i>BRAF</i> and <i>RAS</i> mutations. A high incidence of chromosome 1q gain was seen highlighting its importance in tumor aggressiveness. Two novel fusion genes <i>DLG5</i>-<i>RET</i> and <i>OSBPL1A</i>-<i>BRAF</i> were identified. There was a high frequency of mutations in <i>MED12</i> and these were mutually exclusive to <i>TERT</i> promoter mutations and also to <i>BRAF</i> and <i>RAS</i> mutations.

Endocrine dysfunction following immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.,"Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",Curr Opin Endocrinol Diabetes Obes,2017-10-01,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) represent an important milestone in the modern era of antineoplastic therapy and have ushered optimism amongst oncologists and patients alike. These agents, however, are associated with significant potential toxicities, the importance of which cannot be overstated. The clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management strategies of immune-related endocrinopathies associated with ICI use are described in this case-based review. An increasing number of ICI have shown promise in the management of various malignancies in the recent years. These include cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 inhibitors, programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) antibodies, and PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies. Several endocrinopathies, including hypophysitis, thyroid dysfunction, hyperglycemia, and primary adrenal insufficiency, have been associated with the use of these agents. Toxicities may range from mild transient laboratory abnormalities to potentially life-threatening ones, warranting immediate therapeutic intervention. Combination ICI therapies may be associated with a greater risk of endocrine dysfunction when compared with monotherapy. The clinical presentation and laboratory assessment of these patients often pose a diagnostic challenge as they may be confused by the symptoms related to their underlying malignancy or potential associated acute illnesses.

Phase 2 study evaluating the combination of sorafenib and temsirolimus in the treatment of radioactive iodine-refractory thyroid cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2017-06-29,"Patients with recurrent and/or metastatic, radioactive iodine-refractory thyroid carcinoma have limited treatment options. Sorafenib, an oral kinase inhibitor, is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of radioactive iodine-refractory thyroid carcinoma, although it demonstrated low response rates (12.2%) as a single agent in the first-line setting. The objective of the current study was to determine whether adding the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor temsirolimus to sorafenib could improve on these results. In this single-institution, phase 2 study, 36 patients with metastatic, radioactive iodine-refractory thyroid carcinoma of follicular origin received treatment with the combination of oral sorafenib (200 mg twice daily) and intravenous temsirolimus (25 mg weekly). The receipt of prior systemic treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted therapy, including sorafenib, was permitted. The primary endpoint was the radiographic response rate. The best response was a partial response in 8 patients (22%), stable disease in 21 (58%), and progressive disease in 1 (3%). Six patients were not evaluable for a response. Patients who had received any prior systemic treatment had a response rate of 10% compared with 38% of those who had not received prior systemic treatment. One of 2 patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer had an objective response. The progression-free survival rate at 1 year was 30.5%. The most common grade 3 and 4 toxicities associated with sorafenib and temsirolimus included hyperglycemia, fatigue, anemia, and oral mucositis. Sorafenib and temsirolimus appear to be an active combination in patients with radioactive iodine-refractory thyroid carcinoma, especially in patients who received no prior treatment compared with historic data from single-agent sorafenib. Activity is also observed in patients who previously received sorafenib. This regimen warrants further investigation.

The clinical benefit afforded by immune checkpoint inhibitors can be accompanied by immune-related adverse events (irAE) that affect the skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and endocrine system. The types of irAEs associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors are generally consistent across tumor types. Immune-related endocrine events can affect the pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands, as well as other downstream target organs. These events are unique when compared with other irAEs because the manifestations are often irreversible. Immune-related endocrine events are typically grade 1/2 in severity and often present with non-specific symptoms, making them difficult to diagnose. The mechanisms underlying immune-related target organ damage in select individuals remain mostly undefined.

"Standard-dose pembrolizumab in combination with reduced-dose ipilimumab for patients with advanced melanoma (KEYNOTE-029): an open-label, phase 1b trial.",The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2017-07-17,"Reduced-dose nivolumab in combination with standard-dose ipilimumab improves objective response and progression-free survival compared with standard-dose ipilimumab alone, but increases toxicity. We assessed the safety and anti-tumour activity of standard-dose pembrolizumab in combination with reduced-dose ipilimumab. In this open-label, phase 1b trial, we recruited patients from 12 medical centres in Australia, New Zealand, and the USA. Eligible patients were aged at least 18 years, had advanced melanoma, had an Eastern Coooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, had measurable disease according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, had adequate organ function, had resolution of toxic effects of the most recent previous chemotherapy to grade 1 or less, had no active autoimmune disease requiring systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents, had no active non-infectious pneumonitis, had no uncontrolled thyroid dysfunction or diabetes, had no active brain metastases, and had not received previous immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg plus intravenous ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by intravenous pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks for up to 2 years or disease progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or investigator decision. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability. The proportion of patients achieving an objective response assessed per RECIST version 1.1 by independent central review and overall survival were secondary endpoints. We also assessed progression-free survival. The primary endpoint was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of combination therapy. Activity was assessed in all enrolled patients. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02089685. Enrolment into this cohort is closed, but patients are still being monitored for safety and anti-tumour activity. Between Jan 13, 2015, and Sept 17, 2015, we enrolled and treated 153 patients. As of the Oct 17, 2016, cutoff date, median follow-up was 17·0 months (IQR 14·8-18·8). 110 (72%) of 153 patients received all four pembrolizumab plus ipilimumab doses; 64 (42%) remained on pembrolizumab monotherapy. 110 grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 69 (45%) patients. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Treatment-related adverse events led to discontinuation of pembrolizumab and ipilimumab in 22 (14%) patients, including 17 (11%) who discontinued both treatments for the same event and five (3%) who discontinued ipilimumab for one event and later discontinued pembrolizumab for another. 12 (8%) patients discontinued ipilimumab only and 14 (9%) discontinued pembrolizumab only because of treatment-related adverse events. 158 immune-mediated adverse events of any grade occurred in 92 (60%) patients, and 50 immune-mediated adverse events of grade 3-4 occurred in 42 (27%) patients; the most common immune-mediated adverse events were hypothyroidism (25 [16%]) and hyperthyroidism (17 [11%]). 93 (61% [95% CI 53-69]) patients achieved an objective response. Estimated 1 year progression-free survival was 69% (95% CI 60-75), and estimated 1 year overall survival was 89% (95% CI 83-93). Standard-dose pembrolizumab given in combination with four doses of reduced-dose ipilimumab followed by standard-dose pembrolizumab has a manageable toxicity profile and provides robust anti-tumour activity in patients with advanced melanoma. These data suggest that standard-dose pembrolizumab plus reduced-dose ipilimumab might be a tolerable, efficacious treatment option for patients with advanced melanoma.

Cabozantinib As Salvage Therapy for Patients With Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor-Refractory Differentiated Thyroid Cancer: Results of a Multicenter Phase II International Thyroid Oncology Group Trial.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2017-08-17,"Purpose Sorafenib and lenvatinib are oral multikinase inhibitors targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and approved for radioiodine (RAI)-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). However, there are no approved second- or third-line therapies. MET is implicated in resistance to VEGFR inhibitors. Cabozantinib is an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting MET in addition to VEGFR and is approved for medullary thyroid cancer. In a phase I study of cabozantinib, five of eight patients with DTC previously treated with a VEGFR-targeted therapy had an objective response to cabozantinib. Patients and Methods Patients with RAI-refractory disease with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) measurable disease and evidence of progression on prior VEGFR-targeted therapy were enrolled in this single-arm phase II study. The cabozantinib starting dose was 60 mg/day orally but could be escalated to 80 mg if the patient did not experience a response. Patients underwent tumor assessment according to RECIST v1.1 every 8 weeks. In this study, if at least five of 25 response-evaluable patients had an objective response, cabozantinib would be considered a promising agent in this patient population. Results Twenty-five patients were enrolled. The median age was 64 years, and 64% of patients were men. Twenty-one patients had received only one prior VEGFR-targeted therapy (sorafenib, pazopanib, or cediranib), and four patients had received two such therapies. The most common treatment-related adverse events were fatigue, weight loss, diarrhea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, and hypertension. One drug-related death was noted. Of the 25 patients, 10 (40%) had a partial response, 13 (52%) had stable disease, and two (8%) had nonevaluable disease. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 12.7 months and 34.7 months, respectively. Conclusion Cabozantinib demonstrated clinically significant, durable objective response activity in patients with RAI-refractory DTC who experienced disease progression while taking prior VEGFR-targeted therapy.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",887.0,28.0,Purpose Sorafenib and lenvatinib are oral multikinase inhibitors targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor VEGFR and approved for radioiodine RAI -refractory differentiated cancer DTC However there are no approved second- or third-line therapies MET is implicated in resistance to VEGFR inhibitors Cabozantinib is an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting MET in addition to VEGFR and is approved for medullary cancer In a phase I study of cabozantinib five of eight patients with DTC previously treated with a VEGFR-targeted therapy had an objective response to cabozantinib Patients and Methods Patients with RAI-refractory disease with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor RECIST measurable disease and evidence of progression on prior VEGFR-targeted therapy were enrolled in this single-arm phase II study The cabozantinib starting dose was 60 mg/day orally but could be escalated to 80 mg if the patient did not experience a response Patients underwent tumor assessment according to RECIST v1.1 every 8 weeks In this study if at least five of 25 response-evaluable patients had an objective response cabozantinib would be considered a promising agent in this patient population Results Twenty-five patients were enrolled The median age was 64 years and 64 of patients were men Twenty-one patients had received only one prior VEGFR-targeted therapy sorafenib pazopanib or cediranib and four patients had received two such therapies The most common treatment-related adverse events were fatigue weight loss diarrhea palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia and hypertension One drug-related death was noted Of the 25 patients 10 40 had a partial response 13 52 had stable disease and two 8 had nonevaluable disease The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 12.7 months and 34.7 months respectively Conclusion Cabozantinib demonstrated clinically significant durable objective response activity in patients with RAI-refractory DTC who experienced disease progression while taking prior VEGFR-targeted therapy,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[743, 1034, 2, 5470, 32, 518, 6524, 222, 529, 756, 845, 129, 161, 153, 2134, 2, 850, 9, 7211, 4121, 430, 1442, 12, 5201, 137, 125, 32, 77, 850, 419, 15, 1282, 328, 235, 543, 16, 1771, 4, 251, 6, 2134, 222, 3048, 16, 35, 518, 6524, 230, 529, 543, 4, 352, 6, 2134, 2, 16, 850, 9, 4564, 12, 4, 8, 124, 70, 45, 1, 3048, 365, 1, 659, 7, 5, 5201, 373, 73, 5, 8, 2134, 238, 36, 42, 35, 461, 51, 6, 3048, 7, 2, 636, 7, 5, 4121, 430, 34, 5, 51, 451, 371, 4, 537, 30, 1834, 1884, 34, 2, 241, 1, 91, 23, 324, 2134, 238, 36, 11, 346, 4, 26, 226, 475, 124, 215, 45, 3, 3048, 1723, 61, 10, 335, 81, 218, 1428, 84, 359, 40, 2842, 6, 493, 81, 492, 3, 69, 205, 44, 730, 8, 51, 7, 208, 30, 455, 768, 6, 1834, 7673, 14, 454, 66, 244, 4, 26, 45, 492, 28, 506, 365, 1, 243, 51, 859, 7, 42, 35, 461, 51, 3048, 688, 40, 515, 8, 721, 420, 4, 26, 69, 266, 99, 737, 365, 7, 11, 346, 3, 52, 89, 10, 660, 60, 2, 660, 1, 7, 11, 325, 737, 104, 7, 42, 103, 158, 104, 324, 2134, 238, 36, 1034, 2576, 15, 5274, 2, 294, 7, 42, 103, 100, 225, 235, 3, 96, 186, 24, 139, 290, 281, 11, 613, 924, 407, 1172, 9768, 9769, 10694, 2, 1824, 104, 234, 139, 273, 10, 1051, 1, 3, 243, 7, 79, 327, 42, 8, 450, 51, 233, 653, 42, 585, 34, 2, 100, 66, 42, 21356, 34, 3, 52, 91, 115, 25, 2, 63, 25, 11, 133, 67, 53, 2, 562, 67, 53, 106, 1221, 3048, 264, 505, 93, 1480, 461, 51, 128, 4, 7, 5, 4121, 430, 5201, 54, 592, 34, 91, 369, 2727, 324, 2134, 238, 36]",2041.0,28817373,623
"History of thyroid disease and survival of ovarian cancer patients: results from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium, a brief report.",British journal of cancer,Br. J. Cancer,2017-08-17,"Findings from in vitro studies suggest that increased exposure to thyroid hormones can influence progression of ovarian tumours. However, epidemiologic evidence on this topic is limited. We pooled data from 11 studies from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. Using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models, we estimated associations between hyper- and hypothyroidism and medications prescribed for these conditions with 5-year all-cause survival among women diagnosed with invasive ovarian cancer.

Natural History and Tumor Volume Kinetics of Papillary Thyroid Cancers During Active Surveillance.,JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,2017-10-01,"Active surveillance of low-risk papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is now an accepted alternative to immediate surgery, but experience with this approach outside of Japan is limited. The kinetics (probability, rate, and magnitude) of PTC tumor growth under active surveillance have not been well defined. To describe the kinetics of PTC tumor growth during active surveillance.

Of the 291 patients, 219 (75.3%) were women; mean (SD) age was 52 (15) years. During a median (range) active surveillance of 25 (6-166) months, growth in tumor diameter of 3 mm or more was observed in 11 of 291 (3.8%) patients, with a cumulative incidence of 2.5% (2 years) and 12.1% (5 years). No regional or distant metastases developed during active surveillance. In all cases, 3-dimensional measurements of tumor volume allowed for earlier identification of growth (median, 8.2 months; range, 3-46 months before increase in tumor diameter).

Prognostic Significance of Circulating RET M918T Mutated Tumor DNA in Patients With Advanced Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2017-09-01,"Interpretation of calcitonin measurement to predict the prognosis of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) requires multiple measurements over an extended time period, making it an imperfect biomarker for evaluating prognosis or disease behavior. Single circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) values have been shown to be a valuable prognostic marker for several solid tumors. We tested the hypothesis that cfDNA containing the RET M918T mutation could be detected in the blood of patients with advanced MTC whose tumor harbored an M918T mutation and would be able to predict overall survival more reliably than calcitonin. The level of cfDNA containing RET M918T mutation was measured in the plasma of patients with MTC via droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. Patients had a confirmed sporadic MTC diagnosis, a serum calcitonin measurement >100 pg/mL, and tumor tissue biopsy results providing RET M918T mutation status. There were 75 patients included in this study, 50 of whom harbored an RET M918T mutation by tissue biopsy. RET M918T cfDNA was detected in 16 of 50 patients (32%) with a positive tissue biopsy. The detection of RET M918T cfDNA strongly correlated with worse overall survival and more accurately predicted a worse outcome than calcitonin doubling time. Liquid biopsy is able to detect RET M918T mutations in patient plasma with high specificity but low sensitivity. In patients with established somatic RET M918T mutations, the allelic fraction of circulating tumor DNA is prognostic for overall survival and may play a role in monitoring response to treatment.",Journal Article,872.0,15.0,Interpretation of calcitonin measurement to predict the prognosis of medullary carcinoma MTC requires multiple measurements over an extended time period making it an imperfect biomarker for evaluating prognosis or disease behavior Single circulating cell-free DNA cfDNA values have been shown to be a valuable prognostic marker for several solid tumors We tested the hypothesis that cfDNA containing the RET M918T mutation could be detected in the blood of patients with advanced MTC whose tumor harbored an M918T mutation and would be able to predict overall survival more reliably than calcitonin The level of cfDNA containing RET M918T mutation was measured in the plasma of patients with MTC via droplet digital polymerase chain reaction Patients had a confirmed sporadic MTC diagnosis a serum calcitonin measurement 100 pg/mL and tumor tissue biopsy results providing RET M918T mutation status There were 75 patients included in this study 50 of whom harbored an RET M918T mutation by tissue biopsy RET M918T cfDNA was detected in 16 of 50 patients 32 with a positive tissue biopsy The detection of RET M918T cfDNA strongly correlated with worse overall survival and more accurately predicted a worse outcome than calcitonin doubling time Liquid biopsy is able to detect RET M918T mutations in patient plasma with high specificity but low sensitivity In patients with established somatic RET M918T mutations the allelic fraction of circulating tumor DNA is prognostic for overall survival and may play a role in monitoring response to treatment,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[3037, 1, 11314, 2204, 6, 678, 3, 356, 1, 4564, 134, 3959, 1706, 232, 1685, 252, 35, 1747, 98, 727, 1079, 192, 35, 13613, 901, 9, 1435, 356, 15, 34, 1710, 226, 1033, 31, 115, 261, 3475, 1030, 47, 85, 443, 6, 40, 8, 2926, 177, 952, 9, 392, 537, 57, 21, 650, 3, 1492, 17, 3475, 1101, 3, 2412, 14704, 258, 359, 40, 530, 4, 3, 315, 1, 7, 5, 131, 3959, 1310, 30, 3253, 35, 14704, 258, 2, 688, 40, 1665, 6, 678, 63, 25, 80, 4092, 76, 11314, 3, 301, 1, 3475, 1101, 2412, 14704, 258, 10, 644, 4, 3, 554, 1, 7, 5, 3959, 847, 11032, 3271, 1451, 1260, 1329, 7, 42, 8, 557, 1928, 3959, 147, 8, 524, 11314, 2204, 394, 3234, 542, 2, 30, 246, 411, 99, 1736, 2412, 14704, 258, 156, 125, 11, 481, 7, 159, 4, 26, 45, 212, 1, 953, 3253, 35, 2412, 14704, 258, 20, 246, 411, 2412, 14704, 3475, 10, 530, 4, 245, 1, 212, 7, 531, 5, 8, 109, 246, 411, 3, 638, 1, 2412, 14704, 3475, 1327, 438, 5, 639, 63, 25, 2, 80, 2141, 783, 8, 639, 228, 76, 11314, 4342, 98, 3165, 411, 16, 1665, 6, 1426, 2412, 14704, 138, 4, 69, 554, 5, 64, 1121, 84, 154, 485, 4, 7, 5, 635, 1119, 2412, 14704, 138, 3, 3861, 1509, 1, 1033, 30, 261, 16, 177, 9, 63, 25, 2, 68, 1343, 8, 200, 4, 1315, 51, 6, 24]",1549.0,28911154,307

SKP2 Activation by Thyroid Hormone Receptor β2 Bypasses Rb-Dependent Proliferation in Rb-Deficient Cells.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2017-09-28,"Germline <i>RB1</i> mutations strongly predispose humans to cone precursor-derived retinoblastomas and strongly predispose mice to pituitary tumors, yet shared cell type-specific circuitry that sensitizes these different cell types to the loss of <i>RB1</i> has not been defined. Here we show that the cell type-restricted thyroid hormone receptor isoform TRβ2 sensitizes to <i>RB1</i> loss in both settings by antagonizing the widely expressed and tumor-suppressive TRβ1. TRβ2 promoted expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SKP2, a critical factor for <i>RB1</i>-mutant tumors, by enabling EMI1/FBXO5-dependent inhibition of SKP2 degradation.

"Heterogeneity in Treatment Response of Spine Metastases to Spine Stereotactic Radiosurgery Within ""Radiosensitive"" Subtypes.","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2017-09-01,"To characterize outcomes of metastatic colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) histologies, compared with other radiosensitive histologies, treated with spine stereotactic radiosurgery with regard to local control, overall survival, and predictors of response. A total of 127 patients with 148 spine stereotactic radiosurgery-treated metastatic lesions at our institution between 2003 and 2013 were reviewed. We assessed clinical endpoints in relation to histologic type, including local control (LC) and overall survival (OS), using univariate and multivariate analyses. For all patients, the 1- and 2-year actuarial rates for LC were 82.6% and 75.8%, and rates for OS were 72.9% and 51.5% respectively. Among tumor histologies, 1-year cumulative incidence rates of local failure for thyroid, breast, lung, and colon cancer were 8.7%, 7.0%, 26.6%, and 39.6%, respectively. When analyzed together, NSCLC and colorectal cancers had significantly greater cumulative incidence rates at 1 and 2 years (30.4% and 38.7%, respectively) than other histologies (8.0% and 14.1% respectively, P=.0008). Non-small cell lung cancer/colorectal tumor status was a significant predictor of local failure in a competing risk univariate model (hazard ratio 2.12, 95% confidence interval 1.07-4.17, P=.03) and multivariate model (hazard ratio 2.35, 95% confidence interval 1.12-4.92, P=.024). Spine stereotactic radiosurgery is an effective strategy in achieving local control of spine metastases, particularly among radiosensitive histologies. However, a subset of these classically defined histologies (NSCLC and colorectal) has a propensity toward local failure. In addition to resulting in poorer OS outcomes, the poor LC rates seen in NSCLC and colorectal cancers in this study are more consistent with a radioresistant phenotype, suggesting the need for optimized dosing regimens in this subgroup.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",872.0,5.0,To characterize outcomes of metastatic and cell cancer NSCLC histologies compared with other radiosensitive histologies treated with spine stereotactic radiosurgery with regard to local control overall survival and predictors of response A total of 127 patients with 148 spine stereotactic radiosurgery-treated metastatic lesions at our institution between 2003 and 2013 were reviewed We assessed clinical endpoints in relation to histologic type including local control LC and overall survival OS using univariate and multivariate analyses For all patients the 1- and 2-year actuarial rates for LC were 82.6 and 75.8 and rates for OS were 72.9 and 51.5 respectively Among tumor histologies 1-year cumulative incidence rates of local failure for and cancer were 8.7 7.0 26.6 and 39.6 respectively When analyzed together NSCLC and cancers had significantly greater cumulative incidence rates at 1 and 2 years 30.4 and 38.7 respectively than other histologies 8.0 and 14.1 respectively P=.0008 cell cancer/colorectal tumor status was a significant predictor of local failure in a competing risk univariate model hazard ratio 2.12 95 confidence interval 1.07-4.17 P=.03 and multivariate model hazard ratio 2.35 95 confidence interval 1.12-4.92 P=.024 Spine stereotactic radiosurgery is an effective strategy in achieving local control of spine metastases particularly among radiosensitive histologies However a subset of these classically defined histologies NSCLC and has a propensity toward local failure In addition to resulting in poorer OS outcomes the poor LC rates seen in NSCLC and cancers in this study are more consistent with a radioresistant phenotype suggesting the need for optimized dosing regimens in this subgroup,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[6, 1507, 123, 1, 113, 2, 31, 12, 304, 3489, 72, 5, 127, 9478, 3489, 73, 5, 2342, 1729, 2192, 5, 2539, 6, 293, 182, 63, 25, 2, 674, 1, 51, 8, 181, 1, 4080, 7, 5, 4647, 2342, 1729, 2192, 73, 113, 406, 28, 114, 731, 59, 1522, 2, 1346, 11, 446, 21, 275, 38, 1387, 4, 2191, 6, 884, 267, 141, 293, 182, 1837, 2, 63, 25, 118, 75, 880, 2, 331, 318, 9, 62, 7, 3, 14, 2, 18, 111, 2361, 151, 9, 1837, 11, 878, 49, 2, 481, 66, 2, 151, 9, 118, 11, 720, 83, 2, 725, 33, 106, 107, 30, 3489, 14, 111, 967, 287, 151, 1, 293, 496, 9, 2, 12, 11, 66, 67, 67, 13, 432, 49, 2, 587, 49, 106, 198, 311, 1162, 304, 2, 163, 42, 97, 378, 967, 287, 151, 28, 14, 2, 18, 60, 201, 39, 2, 519, 67, 106, 76, 127, 3489, 66, 13, 2, 213, 14, 106, 19, 7044, 31, 12, 12863, 30, 156, 10, 8, 93, 980, 1, 293, 496, 4, 8, 2573, 43, 880, 202, 360, 197, 18, 133, 48, 307, 268, 14, 1615, 39, 269, 19, 680, 2, 331, 202, 360, 197, 18, 465, 48, 307, 268, 14, 133, 39, 937, 19, 4247, 2342, 1729, 2192, 16, 35, 323, 692, 4, 1785, 293, 182, 1, 2342, 196, 823, 107, 9478, 3489, 137, 8, 697, 1, 46, 9260, 395, 3489, 304, 2, 71, 8, 1925, 1317, 293, 496, 4, 352, 6, 1113, 4, 1769, 118, 123, 3, 334, 1837, 151, 527, 4, 304, 2, 163, 4, 26, 45, 32, 80, 925, 5, 8, 7092, 1005, 802, 3, 594, 9, 4039, 1280, 472, 4, 26, 1363]",1727.0,29029886,538
Differential Growth Rates of Benign vs. Malignant Thyroid Nodules.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2017-12-01,"Thyroid nodule growth was once considered concerning for malignancy, but data showing that benign nodules grow questioned the use of this paradigm. To date, however, no studies have adequately evaluated whether growth rates differ in malignant vs. benign nodules. To sonographically evaluate growth rates in benign and malignant thyroid nodules ≥1 cm. Prospective, cohort study of patients with tissue diagnosis of benign or malignant disease, with repeated ultrasound evaluation six or more months apart. Growth rate in largest dimension of malignant compared with benign thyroid nodules. Regression models were used to evaluate predictors of growth. Malignant nodules (126) met inclusion criteria (≥6-month nonoperative followup) and were compared with 1363 benign nodules. Malignant nodules were not found to be uniquely selected or prospectively observed solely for low-risk phenotype. Median ultrasound intervals were similar (21.8 months for benign nodules; 20.9 months for malignant nodules). Malignant nodules were more likely to grow >2 mm/y compared with benign nodules [relative risk (RR) = 2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.6 to 3.1; P < 0.001], which remained true after adjustment for clinical factors. The RR of a nodule being malignant increased with faster growth rates.

Clin. Oncol.,2017-10-26,"Purpose We report the efficacy and safety of dabrafenib (BRAF inhibitor) and trametinib (MEK inhibitor) combination therapy in BRAF V600E-mutated anaplastic thyroid cancer, a rare, aggressive, and highly lethal malignancy with poor patient outcomes and no systemic therapies with clinical benefit. Methods In this phase II, open-label trial, patients with predefined BRAF V600E-mutated malignancies received dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or death. The primary end point was investigator-assessed overall response rate. Secondary end points included duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. Results Sixteen patients with BRAF V600E-mutated anaplastic thyroid cancer were evaluable (median follow-up, 47 weeks; range, 4 to 120 weeks). All patients had received prior radiation treatment and/or surgery, and six had received prior systemic therapy. The confirmed overall response rate was 69% (11 of 16; 95% CI, 41% to 89%), with seven ongoing responses. Median duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival were not reached as a result of a lack of events, with 12-month estimates of 90%, 79%, and 80%, respectively. The safety population was composed of 100 patients who were enrolled with seven rare tumor histologies. Common adverse events were fatigue (38%), pyrexia (37%), and nausea (35%). No new safety signals were detected. Conclusion Dabrafenib plus trametinib is the first regimen demonstrated to have robust clinical activity in BRAF V600E-mutated anaplastic thyroid cancer and was well tolerated.

Characterization of Thyroid Disorders in Patients Receiving Immune Checkpoint Inhibition Therapy.,Cancer immunology research,Cancer Immunol Res,2017-10-27,"Thyroid disorders have emerged as one of the most common immune-related adverse events associated with anti-PD-1 monotherapy or combination anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy. This study characterizes and compares the evolution of monotherapy and combination therapy-related thyroid disorders. We analyzed the dynamic evolution of thyroid disorders in 45 patients who developed thyroid disorders following treatment with either anti-PD-1 monotherapy or anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 combination therapy. The patients presented with thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism as the initial presentation of their thyroid disorder. Thyrotoxicosis as the initial presentation occurred in the majority of patients (93% and 56% of the patients receiving combination therapy and monotherapy, respectively). The onset pattern of the thyroid disorder was significantly different between the two groups (<i>P</i> = 0.01). Subsequently, 76% and 90% of the patients with thyrotoxicosis evolved to develop hypothyroidism in the combination and monotherapy groups, respectively. In the combination therapy and monotherapy groups, the median times to onset of thyrotoxicosis and hypothyroidism after first treatment were 21 and 63 days, and 31 and 68 days, respectively. The median time for transition from thyrotoxicosis to hypothyroidism was 42 days in both groups. Our study demonstrates that most thyroid disorders induced by either anti-PD-1 or combination anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy are thyroiditis. The time to onset of thyrotoxicosis after treatment initiation and evolution of thyrotoxicosis to hypothyroidism was short, emphasizing the importance of close monitoring of thyroid function in these patients. <i>Cancer Immunol Res; 5(12); 1133-40. ©2017 AACR</i>.",Journal Article,816.0,28.0,disorders have emerged as one of the most common immune-related adverse events associated with anti-PD-1 monotherapy or combination anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy This study characterizes and compares the evolution of monotherapy and combination therapy-related disorders We analyzed the dynamic evolution of disorders in 45 patients who developed disorders following treatment with either anti-PD-1 monotherapy or anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 combination therapy The patients presented with thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism as the initial presentation of their disorder Thyrotoxicosis as the initial presentation occurred in the majority of patients 93 and 56 of the patients receiving combination therapy and monotherapy respectively The onset pattern of the disorder was significantly different between the two groups i P /i 0.01 Subsequently 76 and 90 of the patients with thyrotoxicosis evolved to develop hypothyroidism in the combination and monotherapy groups respectively In the combination therapy and monotherapy groups the median times to onset of thyrotoxicosis and hypothyroidism after first treatment were 21 and 63 days and 31 and 68 days respectively The median time for transition from thyrotoxicosis to hypothyroidism was 42 days in both groups Our study demonstrates that most disorders induced by either anti-PD-1 or combination anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy are thyroiditis The time to onset of thyrotoxicosis after treatment initiation and evolution of thyrotoxicosis to hypothyroidism was short emphasizing the importance of close monitoring of function in these patients i Cancer Immunol Res 5 12 1133-40 ©2017 AACR /i,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[1997, 47, 2054, 22, 104, 1, 3, 96, 186, 250, 139, 290, 281, 41, 5, 312, 333, 14, 1411, 15, 150, 312, 333, 14, 2, 312, 2127, 39, 36, 26, 45, 9239, 2, 5815, 3, 2554, 1, 1411, 2, 150, 36, 139, 1997, 21, 311, 3, 2540, 2554, 1, 1997, 4, 512, 7, 54, 276, 1997, 366, 24, 5, 361, 312, 333, 14, 1411, 15, 312, 333, 14, 2, 312, 2127, 39, 150, 36, 3, 7, 917, 5, 17884, 15, 4147, 22, 3, 388, 1031, 1, 136, 2645, 17884, 22, 3, 388, 1031, 489, 4, 3, 686, 1, 7, 966, 2, 664, 1, 3, 7, 357, 150, 36, 2, 1411, 106, 3, 1707, 1177, 1, 3, 2645, 10, 97, 338, 59, 3, 100, 271, 70, 19, 70, 13, 355, 1611, 846, 2, 424, 1, 3, 7, 5, 17884, 3937, 6, 690, 4147, 4, 3, 150, 2, 1411, 271, 106, 4, 3, 150, 36, 2, 1411, 271, 3, 52, 1072, 6, 1707, 1, 17884, 2, 4147, 50, 157, 24, 11, 239, 2, 676, 162, 2, 456, 2, 806, 162, 106, 3, 52, 98, 9, 1970, 29, 17884, 6, 4147, 10, 595, 162, 4, 110, 271, 114, 45, 1902, 17, 96, 1997, 277, 20, 361, 312, 333, 14, 15, 150, 312, 333, 14, 2, 312, 2127, 39, 36, 32, 16018, 3, 98, 6, 1707, 1, 17884, 50, 24, 1118, 2, 2554, 1, 17884, 6, 4147, 10, 978, 6826, 3, 1187, 1, 2336, 1315, 1, 343, 4, 46, 7, 70, 12, 8557, 1936, 33, 133, 31160, 327, 3194, 1630, 70]",1647.0,29079654,302
Long-term sequelae in survivors of childhood leukemia with Down syndrome: A childhood cancer survivor study report.,Cancer,Cancer,2017-11-03,"Children with Down syndrome (DS) are at increased risk of developing acute leukemia and are more prone to acute toxicities. We studied the incidence and severity of chronic health conditions among survivors of childhood leukemia with DS compared with those without DS. Chronic health conditions reported by questionnaire were compared between 154 pediatric leukemia survivors with DS and 581 without DS, matched by leukemia, age at diagnosis, race/ethnicity, sex, radiation location and chemotherapy exposure using Cox models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subjects were selected from 7139 5-year survivors of leukemia in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. Risk of at least 1 late onset chronic health condition (grade 1-5) was similar in the DS population compared with the non-DS group (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.7-1.5). Serious chronic health conditions (grade 3-5) were more common in DS survivors (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.6), as were ≥ 3 chronic health conditions (grades 1-5) (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.4). The 25-year cumulative incidence of any condition (grades 1-5) was 83% for DS survivors and 69% for non-DS survivors. Leukemia survivors with DS have therapy-related chronic health conditions comparable to those of similarly treated survivors without DS, with a few notable exceptions: 1) an increased risk of cataracts, hearing loss, and thyroid dysfunction compared with survivors without DS (though these are known risks in the DS population), 2) decreased risk of second cancers, and 3) increased risk of severe or multiple conditions.

Cancer incidence and mortality among young adults aged 20-39 years worldwide in 2012: a population-based study.,The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2017-10-27,"To date, the burden of cancer among young adults has rarely been studied in depth. Our aim was to describe the scale and profile of cancer incidence and mortality worldwide among 20-39 year-olds, highlighting major patterns by age, sex, development level, and geographical region. We did a population-based study to quantify the burden of young adult cancers worldwide. We defined young adult cancers as those occurring between the ages of 20 and 39 years because these individuals will have passed puberty and adolescence, but not yet experienced the effects of hormonal decline, immune response deterioration, or organ dysfunction associated with chronic health conditions. Global, regional, and country-specific (n=184) data estimates of the number of new cancer cases and cancer-associated deaths that occurred in 2012 among young adults were extracted in four 5-year bands from the International Agency for Research on Cancer's GLOBOCAN 2012 for all cancers combined and for 27 major types as defined by the International Classification of Disease, tenth revision. We report the number of new cancer cases and cancer-associated deaths overall and by sex alongside corresponding age-standardised rates (ASR) per 100 000 people per year. We also present results using four levels of the Human Development Index (HDI; low [least developed], medium, high, and very high [most developed]), which is a composite indicator for socioeconomic development comprising life expectancy, education, and gross national income. 975 396 new cancer cases and 358 392 cancer-associated deaths occurred among young adults worldwide in 2012, which equated to an ASR of 43·3 new cancer cases per 100 000 people per year and 15·9 cancer-associated deaths per 100 000 people per year. The burden was disproportionally greater among women and the most common cancer types overall in terms of new cases were female breast cancer, cervical cancer, thyroid cancer, leukaemia, and colorectal cancer; in terms of deaths, female breast cancer, liver cancer, leukaemia, and cervical cancer were the main contributors. When assessed by development level and geographical region, the cancer profile varied substantially; generally, the burden of infection-associated cancers was greater in regions under transition. Cancer incidence was elevated in very high-HDI regions compared with low-HDI regions (ASR 64·5 vs 46·2 cancer cases per 100 000 people per year); however, the mortality burden was 3 times higher in low-HDI regions (ASR 25·4 vs 9·2 cancer-associated deaths per 100 000 people per year), reflecting differences in cancer profiles and inferior outcomes. The global cancer burden among 20-39 year-olds differs from that seen in younger or older ages and varies substantially by age, sex, development level, and geographical region. Although the cancer burden is lower in this age group than that observed in older ages, the societal and economic effects remain great given the major effects of premature morbidity and mortality. Targeted surveillance, prevention, and treatment are needed to reduce the cancer burden in this underserved age group.

Clinical performance of a next-generation sequencing assay (ThyroSeq v2) in the evaluation of indeterminate thyroid nodules.,Surgery,Surgery,2017-11-16,"Molecular testing with the Thyroseq v2 next generation sequencing panel (""Thyroseq"") is used to estimate the risk of cancer in indeterminate thyroid nodules. We analyzed 156 indeterminate thyroid nodules evaluated with Thyroseq, across 3 institutions. Thyroseq data and surgical pathology were matched via pathologic re-review. A result was considered Thyroseq positive if molecular alterations were annotated on the report with malignancy probability >30%. Performance characteristics were estimated using Bayes theorem. The Thyroseq-negative call rate was 65% (102/156). On surgical pathology, 16% (10/63) of nodules were malignant. The positive predictive value of a Thyroseq-positive result was 22% (8/37; if 2 noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features are counted as malignant, 27%, 10/37). There was 1 false-negative result (negative predictive value 96%, 22/23). The most common mutation was NRAS (19/37) with a positive predictive value of 7% (1/15). The positive predictive value of all RAS mutations (HRAS, KRAS, NRAS) was 9% (2/22). The second most common mutation, BRAF V600E, had positive predictive value of 100% (3/3). We report an external analysis of Thyroseq performance in the evaluation of indeterminate thyroid nodules.

Real-World Experience with Targeted Therapy for the Treatment of Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2017-12-21,"Patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) have a dismal prognosis, despite systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of targeted therapy in ATC patients when used outside of a clinical trial. This is a retrospective review from April 2015 to May 2016 at a single academic institution where 16 ATC patients receiving targeted therapy outside of a clinical trial were studied. Ten patients (eight BRAF wild type and two BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutant tumors) were started on lenvatinib, and six with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-mutated tumors received a combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib. Best response evaluated by RECIST v1.1, progression-free survival, and overall survival were determined. Adverse events were evaluated for safety. The majority of patients (63%) were men, and all had distant metastases or radiation-resistant primary disease at the time of treatment.

Association of Lymph Node Density With Survival of Patients With Papillary Thyroid Cancer.,JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,2018-02-01,"Lymph node metastases are common in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), yet the impact of nodal metastases on survival remains unclear. Lymph node density (LND) is the ratio between the number of positive lymph nodes excised and the total number of excised lymph nodes. Lymph node density has been suggested as a prognostic factor in many types of cancer. To evaluate the prognostic role of LND in PTC. This cohort study reviewed medical records of patients with PTC who were treated at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2015. Survival and recurrence outcomes were calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Significant variables on univariate analysis were subjected to a Cox proportional hazards regression multivariate model. Primary study outcome was disease-specific survival (DSS); other measurements included overall survival (OS). The study cohort included data for 2542 patients (1801 [71%] male; median age, 48 years [range, 18-97 years]) with a median follow-up of 55 months (range, 4-192 months). The 10-year disease-specific survival rate was 98% for patients with LND of 0.19 or less, compared with 90% for those with LND greater than 0.19 (effect size, 8%; 95% CI, 4%-15%). The 10-year overall survival was 87% for patients with LND of 0.19 or less, compared with 79% for patients with LND greater than 0.19 (effect size, 8%; 95% CI, 3%-15%). Multivariable analysis revealed that LND greater than 0.19 was independently associated with an adverse DSS (hazard ratio [HR], 4.11; 95% CI, 2.11-8.97) and OS (HR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.24-4.11). Subgroup analysis of patients with 18 or more lymph nodes analyzed revealed that LND greater than 0.19 remained a significant marker for DSS (HR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.36-9.81) and OS (HR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.12-5.34). Incorporating LND into the current American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system successfully stratified risk groups compared with the traditional TNM staging system. This single-institute study demonstrates the reproducibility of LND as a predictor of outcomes in PTC.

Familial Cancer Clustering in Urothelial Cancer: A Population-Based Case-Control Study.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2018-05-01,"Family history of bladder cancer confers an increased risk for concordant and discordant cancers in relatives. However, previous studies investigating this relationship lack any correction for smoking status of family members. We conducted a population-based study of cancer risks in relatives of bladder cancer patients and matched controls with exclusion of variant subtypes to improve the understanding of familial cancer clustering. Case subjects with urothelial carcinoma were identified using the Utah Cancer Registry and matched 1:5 to cancer-free controls from the Utah Population Database. Cox regression was used to determine the risk of cancer in first-degree relatives, second-degree relatives, first cousins, and spouses. A total of 229 251 relatives of case subjects and 1 197 552 relatives of matched control subjects were analyzed. To correct for smoking status, we performed a secondary analysis excluding families with elevated rates of smoking-related cancers. All statistical tests were two-sided. First- and second-degree relatives of case subjects had an increased risk for any cancer diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03 to 1.09, P < .001; HR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.07, P = .001) and urothelial cancer (HR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.50 to 1.99, P < .001; HR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.21 to 1.51, P < .001). Site-specific analysis found increased risk for bladder (HR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.47 to 1.95, P < .001), kidney (HR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.08 to 1.57, P = .006), cervical (HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.49, P = .01), and lung cancer (HR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.19 to 1.51, P < .001) in first-degree relatives. Second-degree relatives had increased risk for bladder (HR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.2 to 1.5, P < .001) and thyroid cancer (HR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.35, P = .02). Spouses showed an increased risk for laryngeal (HR = 2.68, 95% CI = 1.02 to 7.05, P = .04) and cervical cancer (HR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.13 to 2.17, P = .007).

Phase I Dose-Escalation Study of Anti-CTLA-4 Antibody Ipilimumab and Lenalidomide in Patients with Advanced Cancers.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2017-12-13,"Preclinical data suggest that combining a checkpoint inhibition with immunomodulatory derivative can increase anticancer response. We designed a dose-escalation study using a 3 + 3 design to determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase II dose (R2PD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab (1.5-3 mg/kg intravenously every 28 days × 4) and lenalidomide (10-25 mg orally daily for 21 of 28 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity) in advanced cancers. Total of 36 patients (Hodgkin lymphoma, 7; melanoma, 5; leiomyosarcoma, 4; renal cancer, 3; thyroid cancer, 3; other cancers, 14; median of 3 prior therapies) were enrolled. The MTD has not been reached and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and lenalidomide 25 mg have been declared as R2PD. DLT were grade (G) 3 rash (3 patients) and G3 pancreatitis (1 patient). G3/4 drug-related toxicities other than DLT were G3 anemia (5 patients), G3 thromboembolism (2 patients), G3 thrombocytopenia, G3 rash, G3 hypopituitarism, G3 pneumonitis, G3 transaminitis, and G4 hypopituitarism (all in 1 patient). Eight patients had tumor shrinkage per immune-related response criteria (-79% to -2%) including a PR (-79% for 7.2+ months) in a refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. Using comprehensive genomic profiling, a total mutation burden (mutations/Mb) was evaluated in 17 patients, with one of the patients achieving a PR demonstrated intermediate mutation burden.

Risk of Hematologic Malignancies After Radioiodine Treatment of Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2017-12-18,"Purpose To investigate the risk and outcomes of second hematologic malignancies (SHMs) in a population-based cohort of patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer (WDTC) treated or not with radioactive iodine (RAI). Methods Patients with WDTC were identified from SEER registries. Competing risk regression analysis was performed to calculate the risks of SHMs that occurred after WDTC treatment and outcomes after SHM development were assessed. Results Of 148,215 patients with WDTC, 53% received surgery alone and 47% received RAI. In total, 783 patients developed an SHM after a median interval of 6.5 years (interquartile range, 3.3 to 11.2 years) from WDTC diagnosis. In multivariable analysis, compared with those undergoing thyroidectomy alone, RAI treatment was associated with an increased early risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia (AML; hazard ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.13 to 2.82; P = .01) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; hazard ratio, 3.44; 95% CI, 1.87 to 6.36; P < .001). This increased risk of AML and CML after RAI treatment was seen even in low-risk and intermediate-risk WDTC tumors. Occurrence of AML but not CML in patients with WDTC was associated with shorter median overall survival compared with matched controls (8.0 years v 31.0 years; P = .001).

Conclusion Patients with WDTC treated with RAI had an increased early risk of developing AML and CML but no other hematologic malignancies. AML that arises after RAI treatment has a poor prognosis.

Improved survival and tumor control with Interleukin-2 is associated with the development of immune-related adverse events: data from the PROCLAIM<sup>SM</sup> registry.,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,J Immunother Cancer,2017-12-19,"Immune related adverse events (irAEs) are associated with immunotherapy for cancer and while results suggest improvement in tumor control and overall survival in those experiencing irAEs, the long-term impact is debated. We evaluated irAE reports related to high dose interleukin-2 therapy (IL-2) documented in the PROCLAIM<sup>SM</sup> registry data base from 2008 to 2016 (NCT01415167, August 9, 2011). Reports on 1535 patients, including 623 with metastatic melanoma (mM) and 919 with metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC) (7 patients had both diseases), were queried for irAEs. The timing of the event was categorized as occurring before, during or after IL-2 or related to any checkpoint inhibitor (CPI). mM patients and mRCC patients were analyzed separately. Tumor control [complete + partial response + stable disease (CR + PR + SD) was compared between those experiencing no irAE versus those with the development of irAEs. Survival was analyzed by tumor type related to timing of irAE and IL-2, and in those with or without exposure to CPI. Median follow-up was 3.5+ years (range 1-8+ years), 152 irAEs were reported in 130 patients (8.4% of all PROCLAIM<sup>SM</sup> patients): 99 (16%) in mM and 53 (5.8%) in mRCC patients. 31 irAEs occurred prior to IL-2, 24 during IL-2, and 97 after IL-2 therapy. 74 irAEs were attributed to IL-2 only (during/ after IL-2). Of the 97 post IL-2 irAEs, 24 were attributed to CPI, and 15 could not be distinguished as caused by IL-2 or CPI. Tumor control was 71% for those experiencing irAE, and 56% for those with no irAE (p = 0.0008). Overall survival was significantly greater for those experiencing irAEs during/ after IL-2 therapy, compared to those with no irAE or irAE before IL-2 therapy, in mM patients, median 48 months vs 18 months (p < 0.0001), and in mRCC patients, median 60 months vs 40 months (p = 0.0302), independent of CPI-related irAEs. IL-2-related irAEs were primarily vitiligo and thyroid dysfunction (70% of IL-2 related irAEs), with limited further impact. irAEs following IL-2 therapy are associated with improved tumor control and overall survival.

Artificial neural network model to distinguish follicular adenoma from follicular carcinoma on fine needle aspiration of thyroid.,Diagnostic cytopathology,Diagn. Cytopathol.,2017-12-20,"To distinguish follicular adenoma (FA) and follicular carcinoma (FC) of thyroid in fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is a challenging problem. In this article, we attempted to build an artificial neural network (ANN) model from the cytological and morphometric features of the FNAC smears of thyroid to distinguish FA from FC. The cytological features and morphometric analysis were done on the FNAC smears of histology proven cases of FA (26) and FC (31). The cytological features were analysed semi-quantitatively by two independent observers (RS and PD). These data were used to make an ANN model to differentiate FA versus FC on FNAC material. The performance of this ANN model was assessed by analysing the confusion matrix and receiving operator curve. There were 39 cases in training set, 9 cases each in validation and test sets. In the test group, ANN model successfully distinguished all cases (9/9) of FA and FC. The area under receiver operating curve was 1. The present ANN model is efficient to diagnose follicular adenoma and carcinoma cases on cytology smears without any error. In future, this ANN model will be able to diagnose follicular adenoma and carcinoma cases on thyroid aspirate. This study has immense potential in future.

Genomic Correlates of Response to Everolimus in Aggressive Radioiodine-refractory Thyroid Cancer: A Phase II Study.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2018-01-04,"<b>Purpose:</b> Targeting mutations leading to PI3K/mTOR/Akt activation are of interest in thyroid cancer. We evaluated the efficacy of everolimus in aggressive, radioactive iodine-refractory (RAIR) thyroid cancer and correlated tumor mutational profiling with response. Exploratory medullary and anaplastic thyroid cancer cohorts were included.<b>Experimental Design:</b> This single-arm, multi-institutional phase II study was conducted from 2009 to 2013 in patients with incurable RAIR thyroid cancer who had radiographic progression six months prior to enrollment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) with a median follow-up of 31.8 months. The study is closed to enrollment but treatment and follow-up are ongoing. A targeted next-generation sequencing platform was used for mutational analysis.<b>Results:</b> Thirty-three patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), 10 with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), and 7 with anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) enrolled. For the DTC cohort, median PFS was 12.9 months (95% CI, 7.3-18.5) with a 2-year PFS of 23.6% (95% CI, 10.5-39.5). Median OS was not reached; 2-year OS was 73.5% (95% CI, 53.8-85.8). Among ATC patients, 1 had a partial response and was progression-free until 17.9 months after study entry and one had disease stability for 26 months, respectively. The genomically profiled cohort enriched for PI3K/mTOR/Akt alterations. <i>PI3K/mTOR/Akt</i>-mutated ATC subgroups appeared to benefit from everolimus. Treatment-related adverse events were as anticipated.<b>Conclusions:</b> Everolimus has significant antitumor activity in thyroid cancer.

Radiotheranostics in Cancer Diagnosis and Management.,Radiology,Radiology,2018-02-01,"The fundamental foundation for precision medicine is accurate and specific targeting of cancer cells. Advances in the understanding of cancer biology, developments in diagnostic technologies, and expansion of therapeutic options have all contributed to the concept of personalized cancer care. Theranostics is the systematic integration of targeted diagnostics and therapeutics. The theranostic platform includes an imaging component that ""sees"" the lesions followed by administration of the companion therapy agent that ""treats"" the same lesions. This strategy leads to enhanced therapy efficacy, manageable adverse events, improved patient outcome, and lower overall costs. Radiotheranostics refers to the use of radionuclides for the paired imaging and therapy agents. Radioiodine is the classic radiotheranostic agent that has been used clinically in management of thyroid diseases for nearly 75 years. More recently there have been major exciting strides in radiotheranostics for neuroendocrine tumors and prostate cancer, among other conditions. Regulatory approval of a number of radiotheranostic pairs is anticipated in the near future. Continued support will be needed in research and development to keep pace with the current momentum in radiotheranostics innovations. Moreover, regulatory and reimbursement agencies need to streamline their requirements for seamless transfer of the radiotheranostic agents from the bench to the bedside.

PD-L1 and IDO1 Are Expressed in Poorly Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma.,Endocrine pathology,Endocr. Pathol.,2018-03-01,"Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC) is an aggressive form of thyroid cancer that currently has limited effective treatment options. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown to be an effective treatment for a variety of carcinomas. In this study, we explore whether immune checkpoint pathways, such as programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), are activated in a cohort of patients with PDTC to determine whether ICIs may be an effective therapy for these patients. PDTC from 28 patients were stained for IDO1, PD-L1, and CD8 using immunohistochemistry. Staining was scored using an H-score, and PD-L1 and IDO1 expression was correlated with clinicopathologic characteristics. Positivity for PD-L1 and IDO1 was set at an H-score cutoff of five. Twenty-five percent (n = 7/28) of the PDTC were positive for PD-L1 expression. Twenty-nine percent (n = 2/7) of the PD-L1 positive PDTCs also co-expressed IDO1. The expression of PD-L1 in PDTC was significantly associated with tumor size and multifocality, with a non-significant trend towards associations with older age, extrathyroidal extension, presence of metastasis, higher stage, increased number of CD8+ T cells, and decreased disease-free and overall survival. PD-L1 expression occurs in a subset of PDTC, and is associated with a subset of clinical features of aggressive thyroid disease.

A Homozygous RET K666N Genotype With an MEN2A Phenotype.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol.

We describe a patient with homozygous RET K666N mutation with MTC and bilateral pheochromocytoma (PHEO). A 59-year-old woman received a diagnosis of MTC after biopsy of two thyroid nodules. Coincident biochemical and radiologic testing was suspicious for bilateral PHEO, confirmed after bilateral adrenalectomy. There was no evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). She had a total thyroidectomy with neck dissection revealing bilateral MTC with lymph node metastases. Germline RET testing identified homozygous K666N mutations. Genetic testing of family members showed that both adult children harbor a heterozygous K666N mutation. Her 32-year-old son had an elevated calcitonin level and underwent thyroidectomy, which identified MTC. Her 30-year-old daughter had a normal calcitonin level. Prophylactic thyroidectomy showed C-cell hyperplasia only. Three of seven other family members were tested and found to carry the mutation. All had normal calcitonin levels, and none had biochemical evidence of PHEO or PHPT. Given the absence of PHEO in reported RET K666N families, our proband underwent genetic testing for causes of hereditary paragangliomas or PHEO. No additional mutations were identified. Here we report a case of a homozygous RET K666N mutation leading to coincident MTC and PHEO. Heterozygous presentations of RET K666N mutations have low penetrance for isolated MTC.

Hyperparathyroidism Mimicking Metastatic Bone Disease: A Case Report and Review of Literature.,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,2018-02-15,"Multiple osteolytic lesions are usually associated with metastatic involvement of the bone; however, metabolic bone diseases should also be included in the differential diagnosis. In this study, we describe a case of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) with multiple osteolytic lesions that was diagnosed initially as having metastatic bone involvement. The laboratory results showed hypercalcemia and raised alkaline phosphatase along with fibrosis in the bone marrow biopsy with no increase in tumor markers and normal serum protein electrophoresis.

Reasons Associated with Total Thyroidectomy as Initial Surgical Management of an Indeterminate Thyroid Nodule.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2018-03-08,"Diagnostic hemithyroidectomy (HT) is the most widely recommended surgical procedure for a nodule with indeterminate cytology; however, additional details may make initial total thyroidectomy (TT) preferable. We sought to identify patient-specific factors (PSFs) associated with initial TT in patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules. Retrospective analysis of all patients with a thyroid nodule ≥ 1 cm and initial cytology of atypia of undetermined significance or suspicious for follicular neoplasm between 2012 and 2015 who underwent thyroidectomy. Medical records were reviewed for patient demographics, neck symptoms, nodule size, cytology, molecular test results, final histopathology, and additional PSFs influencing surgical management. Variables were analyzed to determine associations with the use of initial TT. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent associations. Of 325 included patients, 182/325 (56.0%) had HT and 143/325 (44.0%) had TT. While patient age and sex, nodule size, and cytology result were not associated with initial treatment, five PSFs were associated with initial TT (p < 0.0001). These included contralateral nodules, hypothyroidism, fluorodeoxyglucose avidity on positron emission tomography scan, family history of thyroid cancer, and increased surgical risk. At least one PSF was present in 126/143 (88.1%) TT patients versus 47/182 (25.8%) HT patients (p < 0.0001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that these variables were the strongest independent predictor of TT (odds ratio 45.93, 95% confidence interval 18.80-112.23, p < 0.001).

Utility of the BRAF p.V600E immunoperoxidase stain in FNA direct smears and cell block preparations from patients with thyroid carcinoma.,Cancer cytopathology,Cancer Cytopathol,2018-03-26,"The identification of BRAF mutations in thyroid cancer has prognostic and therapeutic implications. Although the gold standard for identifying BRAF mutations is molecular testing, the ability to perform BRAF p.V600E immunostaining on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) samples can facilitate the rapid triaging of patients to treatment options. A total of 50 thyroid carcinoma FNA samples, including papillary (29 samples), poorly differentiated (10 samples), anaplastic (9 samples), and Hurthle cell (2 samples) carcinomas, with a known BRAF p.V600E mutation status were selected for the current study. Immunostaining was performed on smears and cell block sections using an anti-BRAF p.V600E antibody (clone VE1). The results were compared with the known mutation status obtained by molecular testing and/or immunostaining of surgical pathology material from the same patient. Of the total of 50 cases, 26 cases had smears available for the evaluation of BRAF p.V600E immunostaining; positive immunostaining was noted in 16 samples and negative immunostaining was noted in 4 samples, whereas 6 cases were equivocal. Of the 34 cases for which cell blocks were available for evaluation, BRAF p.V600E immunostaining was positive in 17 cases, negative in 16 cases, and equivocal in 1 case. The overall sensitivity and specificity of BRAF p.V600E immunostaining on the cell block preparation was 94.4% and 100%, respectively, whereas for the smears it was 80% and 63.6%, respectively. BRAF p.V600E immunostaining can be performed reliably on thyroid FNA cell block preparations. However, false-positive results on direct smears limit their utility and therefore need to be interpreted with caution.

"Larotrectinib for paediatric solid tumours harbouring NTRK gene fusions: phase 1 results from a multicentre, open-label, phase 1/2 study.",The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2018-03-29,"Gene fusions involving NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 (TRK fusions) are found in a broad range of paediatric and adult malignancies. Larotrectinib, a highly selective small-molecule inhibitor of the TRK kinases, had shown activity in preclinical models and in adults with tumours harbouring TRK fusions. This study aimed to assess the safety of larotrectinib in paediatric patients. This multicentre, open-label, phase 1/2 study was done at eight sites in the USA and enrolled infants, children, and adolescents aged 1 month to 21 years with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours or CNS tumours that had relapsed, progressed, or were non-responsive to available therapies regardless of TRK fusion status; had a Karnofsky (≥16 years of age) or Lansky (<16 years of age) performance status score of 50 or more, adequate organ function, and full recovery from the acute toxic effects of all previous anticancer therapy. Following a protocol amendment on Sept 12, 2016, patients with locally advanced infantile fibrosarcoma who would require disfiguring surgery to achieve a complete surgical resection were also eligible. Patients were enrolled to three dose cohorts according to a rolling six design. Larotrectinib was administered orally (capsule or liquid formulation), twice daily, on a continuous 28-day schedule, in increasing doses adjusted for age and bodyweight. The primary endpoint of the phase 1 dose escalation component was the safety of larotrectinib, including dose-limiting toxicity. All patients who received at least one dose of larotrectinib were included in the safety analyses. Reported here are results of the phase 1 dose escalation cohort. Phase 1 follow-up and phase 2 are ongoing. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02637687. Between Dec 21, 2015, and April 13, 2017, 24 patients (n=17 with tumours harbouring TRK fusions, n=7 without a documented TRK fusion) with a median age of 4·5 years (IQR 1·3-13·3) were enrolled to three dose cohorts: cohorts 1 and 2 were assigned doses on the basis of both age and bodyweight predicted by use of SimCyp modelling to achieve an area under the curve equivalent to the adult doses of 100 mg twice daily (cohort 1) and 150 mg twice daily (cohort 2); and cohort 3 was assigned to receive a dose of 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> twice daily (maximum 100 mg per dose), regardless of age, equating to a maximum of 173% of the recommended adult phase 2 dose. Among enrolled patients harbouring TRK fusion-positive cancers, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. Adverse events were predominantly grade 1 or 2 (occurring in 21 [88%] of 24 patients); the most common larotrectinib-related adverse events of all grades were increased alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ten [42%] of 24 each), leucopenia (five [21%] of 24), decreased neutrophil count (five [21%] of 24), and vomiting (five [21%] of 24). Grade 3 alanine aminotransferase elevation was the only dose-limiting toxicity and occurred in one patient without a TRK fusion and with progressive disease. No grade 4 or 5 treatment-related adverse events were observed. Two larotrectinib-related serious adverse events were observed: grade 3 nausea and grade 3 ejection fraction decrease during the 28-day follow-up after discontinuing larotrectinib and while on anthracyclines. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached, and 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (maximum of 100 mg per dose) was established as the recommended phase 2 dose. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response. None of the seven patients with TRK fusion-negative cancers had an objective response. The TRK inhibitor larotrectinib was well tolerated in paediatric patients and showed encouraging antitumour activity in all patients with TRK fusion-positive tumours. The recommended phase 2 dose was defined as 100mg/m<sup>2</sup> (maximum 100 mg per dose) for infants, children, and adolescents, regardless of age.

in paediatric patients This multicentre open-label phase 1/2 study was done at eight sites in the USA and enrolled infants children and adolescents aged 1 month to 21 years with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours or CNS tumours that had relapsed progressed or were non-responsive to available therapies regardless of TRK fusion status had a Karnofsky ≥16 years of age or Lansky 16 years of age performance status score of 50 or more adequate organ function and full recovery from the acute toxic effects of all previous anticancer therapy Following a protocol amendment on Sept 12 2016 patients with locally advanced infantile fibrosarcoma who would require disfiguring surgery to achieve a complete surgical resection were also eligible Patients were enrolled to three dose cohorts according to a rolling six design Larotrectinib was administered orally capsule or liquid formulation twice daily on a continuous 28-day schedule in increasing doses adjusted for age and bodyweight The primary endpoint of the phase 1 dose escalation component was the safety of larotrectinib including dose-limiting toxicity All patients who received at least one dose of larotrectinib were included in the safety analyses Reported here are results of the phase 1 dose escalation cohort Phase 1 follow-up and phase 2 are ongoing This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT02637687 Between Dec 21 2015 and April 13 2017 24 patients n=17 with tumours harbouring TRK fusions n=7 without a documented TRK fusion with a median age of 4·5 years IQR 1·3-13·3 were enrolled to three dose cohorts cohorts 1 and 2 were assigned doses on the basis of both age and bodyweight predicted by use of SimCyp modelling to achieve an area under the curve equivalent to the adult doses of 100 mg twice daily cohort 1 and 150 mg twice daily cohort 2 and cohort 3 was assigned to receive a dose of 100 mg/m sup 2 /sup twice daily maximum 100 mg per dose regardless of age equating to a maximum of 173 of the recommended adult phase 2 dose Among enrolled patients harbouring TRK fusion-positive cancers eight 47 had infantile fibrosarcoma seven 41 had other soft tissue sarcomas and two 12 had papillary cancer Adverse events were predominantly grade 1 or 2 occurring in 21 88 of 24 patients the most common larotrectinib-related adverse events of all grades were increased alanine and aspartate aminotransferase ten 42 of 24 each leucopenia five 21 of 24 decreased neutrophil count five 21 of 24 and vomiting five 21 of 24 Grade 3 alanine aminotransferase elevation was the only dose-limiting toxicity and occurred in one patient without a TRK fusion and with progressive disease No grade 4 or 5 treatment-related adverse events were observed Two larotrectinib-related serious adverse events were observed grade 3 nausea and grade 3 ejection fraction decrease during the 28-day follow-up after discontinuing larotrectinib and while on anthracyclines The maximum tolerated dose was not reached and 100 mg/m sup 2 /sup maximum of 100 mg per dose was established as the recommended phase 2 dose 14 93 of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response None of the seven patients with TRK fusion-negative cancers had an objective response The TRK inhibitor larotrectinib was well tolerated in paediatric patients and showed encouraging antitumour activity in all patients with TRK fusion-positive tumours The recommended phase 2 dose was defined as 100mg/m sup 2 /sup maximum 100 mg per dose for infants children and adolescents regardless of age Loxo Oncology

Quantitative Analysis of the Benefits and Risk of Thyroid Nodule Evaluation in Patients ≥70 Years Old.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2018-04-02,"In older patients, thyroid nodules are frequently detected and referred for evaluation, though usually prove to be benign disease or low-risk cancer. Therefore, management should be guided not solely by malignancy risk, but also by the relative risks of any intervention. Unfortunately, few such data are available for patients ≥70 years old. All consecutive patients ≥70 years old assessed by ultrasound (US) and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) between 1995 and 2015 were analyzed. Clinical, US, and histologic data, including patient comorbidities and outcomes, were obtained. Imaging and cytology results from initial evaluation were reviewed to detect significant-risk thyroid cancer (SRTC), which was defined as anaplastic, medullary, or poorly differentiated carcinoma, or the presence of distant metastases. Overall survival analyses were then performed to assist with risk-to-benefit assessment. A total of 1129 patients ≥70 years old with 2527 nodules ≥1 cm were evaluated. FNA was safe in all, and cytology proved benign in 67.3% of patients. However, FNA led to surgery in 208 patients, of whom 93 (44.7%) had benign histopathology. Among all patients who underwent FNA, only 17 (1.5%) SRTC were identified, all of which were preoperatively identifiable by imaging and/or cytology. These SRTC were responsible for all (n = 10; 0.9%) thyroid cancer deaths. Among all other patients (n = 1112), 160 deaths (14.4%) were confirmed during a median follow-up of four years. None of these were thyroid cancer related. Survival analysis for these 1112 patients demonstrated that a separate non-thyroidal malignancy or coronary artery disease at the time of nodule evaluation was associated with increased mortality compared to those without these diagnoses (hazard ratio = 2.32 [confidence interval 1.66-3.26]; p < 0.01), confirming these are important variables to identify prior to thyroid nodule evaluation. For patients ≥70 years old, US and FNA are safe and prove helpful in identifying SRTC and benign cytology. However, the surgical management of patients ≥70 years old presenting without high-risk findings should be tempered, especially when comorbid illness is identified.",Journal Article,659.0,4.0,In older patients nodules are frequently detected and referred for evaluation though usually prove to be benign disease or low-risk cancer Therefore management should be guided not solely by malignancy risk but also by the relative risks of any intervention Unfortunately few such data are available for patients ≥70 years old All consecutive patients ≥70 years old assessed by ultrasound US and fine-needle aspiration FNA between 1995 and 2015 were analyzed Clinical US and histologic data including patient comorbidities and outcomes were obtained Imaging and cytology results from initial evaluation were reviewed to detect significant-risk cancer SRTC which was defined as anaplastic medullary or poorly differentiated carcinoma or the presence of distant metastases Overall survival analyses were then performed to assist with risk-to-benefit assessment A total of 1129 patients ≥70 years old with 2527 nodules ≥1 cm were evaluated FNA was safe in all and cytology proved benign in 67.3 of patients However FNA led to surgery in 208 patients of whom 93 44.7 had benign histopathology Among all patients who underwent FNA only 17 1.5 SRTC were identified all of which were preoperatively identifiable by imaging and/or cytology These SRTC were responsible for all n 10 0.9 cancer deaths Among all other patients n 1112 160 deaths 14.4 were confirmed during a median follow-up of four years None of these were cancer related Survival analysis for these 1112 patients demonstrated that a separate non-thyroidal malignancy or coronary artery disease at the time of nodule evaluation was associated with increased mortality compared to those without these diagnoses hazard ratio 2.32 confidence interval 1.66-3.26 p 0.01 confirming these are important variables to identify prior to nodule evaluation For patients ≥70 years old US and FNA are safe and prove helpful in identifying SRTC and benign cytology However the surgical management of patients ≥70 years old presenting without high-risk findings should be tempered especially when comorbid illness is identified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[4, 434, 7, 2597, 32, 746, 530, 2, 1995, 9, 451, 2471, 2082, 4361, 6, 40, 1002, 34, 15, 154, 43, 12, 673, 284, 257, 40, 1808, 44, 5558, 20, 710, 43, 84, 120, 20, 3, 580, 1098, 1, 500, 788, 3869, 1021, 225, 74, 32, 390, 9, 7, 6146, 60, 1095, 62, 935, 7, 6146, 60, 1095, 275, 20, 1945, 843, 2, 2924, 2177, 3256, 4064, 59, 2323, 2, 1483, 11, 311, 38, 843, 2, 884, 74, 141, 69, 1909, 2, 123, 11, 683, 270, 2, 2045, 99, 29, 388, 451, 11, 446, 6, 1426, 93, 43, 12, 36580, 92, 10, 395, 22, 1841, 4564, 15, 1240, 1442, 134, 15, 3, 463, 1, 626, 196, 63, 25, 318, 11, 818, 173, 6, 3425, 5, 43, 6, 247, 455, 8, 181, 1, 22295, 7, 6146, 60, 1095, 5, 39837, 2597, 3567, 494, 11, 194, 4064, 10, 1165, 4, 62, 2, 2045, 4328, 1002, 4, 598, 27, 1, 7, 137, 4064, 836, 6, 152, 4, 5920, 7, 1, 953, 966, 584, 67, 42, 1002, 3831, 107, 62, 7, 54, 208, 4064, 158, 269, 14, 33, 36580, 11, 108, 62, 1, 92, 11, 3888, 6237, 20, 270, 2, 15, 2045, 46, 36580, 11, 2327, 9, 62, 78, 79, 13, 83, 12, 1043, 107, 62, 127, 7, 78, 20805, 3457, 1043, 213, 39, 11, 557, 190, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 294, 60, 1292, 1, 46, 11, 12, 139, 25, 65, 9, 46, 20805, 7, 264, 17, 8, 2282, 220, 34627, 710, 15, 6236, 2872, 34, 28, 3, 98, 1, 5072, 451, 10, 41, 5, 101, 282, 72, 6, 135, 187, 46, 2403, 360, 197, 18, 531, 307, 268, 14, 700, 27, 432, 19, 13, 355, 5030, 46, 32, 305, 682, 6, 255, 324, 6, 5072, 451, 9, 7, 6146, 60, 1095, 843, 2, 4064, 32, 1165, 2, 4361, 3951, 4, 1386, 36580, 2, 1002, 2045, 137, 3, 221, 284, 1, 7, 6146, 60, 1095, 1656, 187, 64, 43, 272, 257, 40, 18555, 1093, 198, 3952, 2973, 16, 108]",2067.0,29608439,294
Cumulative Burden of Morbidity Among Testicular Cancer Survivors After Standard Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy: A Multi-Institutional Study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2018-04-04,"Purpose In this multicenter study, we evaluated the cumulative burden of morbidity (CBM) among > 1,200 testicular cancer survivors and applied factor analysis to determine the co-occurrence of adverse health outcomes (AHOs). Patients and Methods Participants were ≤ 55 years of age at diagnosis, finished first-line chemotherapy ≥ 1 year previously, completed a comprehensive questionnaire, and underwent physical examination. Treatment data were abstracted from medical records. A CBM score encompassed the number and severity of AHOs, with ordinal logistic regression used to assess associations with exposures. Nonlinear factor analysis and the nonparametric dimensionality evaluation to enumerate contributing traits procedure determined which AHOs co-occurred. Results Among 1,214 participants, approximately 20% had a high (15%) or very high/severe (4.1%) CBM score, whereas approximately 80% scored medium (30%) or low/very low (47%). Increased risks of higher scores were associated with four cycles of either ifosfamide, etoposide, and cisplatin (odds ratio [OR], 1.96; 95% CI, 1.04 to 3.71) or bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.98), older attained age (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.26), current disability leave (OR, 3.53; 95% CI, 1.57 to 7.95), less than a college education (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.87), and current or former smoking (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.63). CBM score did not differ after either chemotherapy regimen ( P = .36). Asian race (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.72) and vigorous exercise (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.89) were protective.

Hypothyroidism During Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy Is Associated with Longer Survival in Patients with Advanced Nonthyroidal Cancers.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2018-04-01,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-induced thyroid dysfunction is recognized as a common adverse effect of treatment, but the importance of incident hypothyroidism during TKI therapy remains unclear. This study analyzed the prognostic significance of hypothyroidism during TKI therapy in cancer patients. This was a retrospective cohort study of adult patients with advanced nonthyroidal cancer treated with TKI and available thyroid function testing at three affiliated academic hospitals from 2000 to 2017. Patients with preexisting thyroid disease were excluded. Demographic, clinical, and cancer treatment data were collected. Thyroid status with TKI treatment was determined from thyroid function testing and initiation of thyroid medication, and classified as euthyroid (thyrotropin [TSH] normal), subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH; TSH 5-10 mIU/L, or higher TSH if free thyroxine normal), or overt hypothyroidism (OH; TSH >10 mIU/L, low free thyroxine, or requiring replacement). Multivariate models were used to evaluate the effect of TKI-related hypothyroidism on overall survival (OS). Of 1120 initial patients, 538 remained after exclusion criteria. SCH occurred in 72 (13%) and OH in 144 (27%) patients with TKI therapy. Patients with hypothyroidism had significantly longer OS, with median OS in euthyroid patients of 685 days [confidence interval (CI) 523-851] compared to 1005 days [CI 634-1528] in SCH and 1643 days [CI 1215-1991] in OH patients (p < 0.0001). After adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, cancer type, cancer stage, ECOG performance status, and checkpoint inhibitor therapy, OH remained significantly associated with OS (hazard ratio = 0.561; p < 0.0001), whereas SCH did not (hazard ratio = 0.796; p = 0.165). Analysis of hypothyroid patients (SCH and OH) with TSH >5 and <10 mIU/L stratified by hormone replacement status showed improved survival associated with hormone replacement.

Risk Factors for New Hypothyroidism During Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy in Advanced Nonthyroidal Cancer Patients.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2018-04-01,"Thyroid dysfunction during tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) cancer treatment is common, but predisposing risk factors have not been determined. Recommendations for monitoring patients treated with one or multiple TKI and in conjunction with other relevant cancer therapies could be improved. The study objective was to assess the risk factors for new thyroid dysfunction in TKI-treated previously euthyroid cancer patients. A retrospective cohort study of patients with advanced nonthyroidal cancer treated with TKI from 2000 to 2017, having available thyroid function tests showing initial euthyroid status, excluding patients with preexisting thyroid disease or lack of follow-up thyroid function tests. During TKI treatment, patients were classified as euthyroid (thyrotropin [TSH] normal), subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH 5-10 mIU/L, or higher TSH if free thyroxine normal), or overt hypothyroidism (TSH >10 mIU/L, low free thyroxine, or requiring thyroid hormone replacement). The timing of thyroid dysfunction and TKI used were assessed. Risk factors for incident hypothyroidism were evaluated using multivariate models. In 538 adult patients included, subclinical hypothyroidism occurred in 71 (13.2%) and overt hypothyroidism occurred in 144 (26.8%) patients with TKI therapy, following a median cumulative TKI exposure of 196 days (interquartile range [IQR] 63.5-518.5 days). The odds of hypothyroidism were greatest during the first six months on a TKI. Median exposure time on the TKI concurrent with thyroid dysfunction in patients treated with only one TKI was 85 days (IQR 38-293.5 days) and was similar to the 74 days (IQR 38-133.3 days) in patients treated previously with other TKI (p = 0.41). Patients who developed hypothyroidism compared to those who remained euthyroid had greater odds of being female (odds ratio = 1.99 [confidence interval 1.35-2.93], p < 0.01), but greater cumulative TKI exposure and greater number of TKI received were not associated with thyroid dysfunction.

Treatment-emergent hypertension and efficacy in the phase 3 Study of (E7080) lenvatinib in differentiated cancer of the thyroid (SELECT).,Cancer,Cancer,2018-04-14,"Hypertension (HTN) is an established class effect of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibition. In the phase 3 Study of (E7080) Lenvatinib in Differentiated Cancer of the Thyroid (SELECT) trial, HTN was the most frequent adverse event of lenvatinib, an inhibitor of VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα), ret proto-oncogene (RET), and stem cell factor receptor (KIT). This exploratory analysis examined treatment-emergent hypertension (TE-HTN) and its relation with lenvatinib efficacy and safety in SELECT. In the multicenter, double-blind SELECT trial, 392 patients with progressive radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC) were randomized 2:1 to lenvatinib (24 mg/d on a 28-day cycle) or placebo. Survival endpoints were assessed with Kaplan-Meier estimates and log-rank tests. The influence of TE-HTN on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was analyzed with univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. Overall, 73% of lenvatinib-treated patients and 15% of placebo-treated patients experienced TE-HTN. The median PFS for lenvatinib-treated patients with (n = 190) and without TE-HTN (n = 71) was 18.8 and 12.9 months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39-0.88; P = .0085). For lenvatinib-treated patients, the objective response rate was 69% with TE-HTN and 56% without TE-HTN (odds ratio, 1.72; 95% CI, 0.98-3.01). The median change in tumor size for patients with and without TE-HTN was -45% and -40%, respectively (P = .2). The median OS was not reached for patients with TE-HTN; for those without TE-HTN, it was 21.7 months (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.27-0.69; P = .0003). Although HTN is a clinically significant adverse event that warrants monitoring and management, TE-HTN was significantly correlated with improved outcomes in patients with RR-DTC, indicating that HTN may be predictive for lenvatinib efficacy in this population.

Predictors of Hypothyroidism in Hodgkin Lymphoma Survivors After Intensity Modulated Versus 3-Dimensional Radiation Therapy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2018-03-14,"To identify predictors of hypothyroidism after chemoradiation therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and to compare outcomes after intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with those after 3-dimensional (3D) conformal radiation therapy (CRT). Ninety patients who underwent involved-site IMRT in 2009 through 2014 were evaluated for treatment-induced hypothyroidism, defined as elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone or decreased free thyroxine levels (or both). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified individuals at low versus high risk based on dosimetric variables. Dosimetric cutoff points were verified with an external data set of 50 patients who underwent 3D-CRT. In the IMRT group, most patients (75 [83%]) had stage II HL, and the median prescribed dose was 30.6 Gy; in the 3D-CRT group, 32 patients (64%) had stage II HL, and the median prescribed dose was 32.0 Gy. No differences were found in the proportions of patients with bilateral (P = .982) or unilateral (P = .074) neck involvement between the 2 groups. Hypothyroidism rates were marginally higher in the IMRT group, with estimated 3-year rates of freedom from hypothyroidism of 56.1% in the 3D-CRT group and 40% in the IMRT group (P = .057). Univariate analysis showed that smaller thyroid volume and higher thyroid dose were associated with hypothyroidism in both groups (P < .05). In the IMRT group, the percentage of the thyroid gland volume receiving ≥25 Gy (V25) and the absolute volume of the thyroid gland spared from 25 Gy (VS25Gy) were the strongest predictors of hypothyroidism (P = .001 and P < .001, respectively). Cutoff points of 63.5% (V25) and 2.2 mL (VS25Gy) classified patients as high risk (80%-82%) or low risk (37%-44%) (P < .001). Use of a thyroid avoidance structure reduced the incidence of hypothyroidism (P < .05) in the IMRT group. The percentage of the thyroid receiving 25 Gy and the volume of the thyroid spared from 25 Gy predicted the risk of hypothyroidism after either IMRT or 3D-CRT for HL. IMRT may confer a higher risk than 3D-CRT unless a treatment avoidance structure is used during planning.",Journal Article,678.0,5.0,To identify predictors of hypothyroidism after chemoradiation therapy for HL and to compare outcomes after intensity modulated radiation therapy IMRT with those after 3-dimensional 3D conformal radiation therapy CRT Ninety patients who underwent involved-site IMRT in 2009 through 2014 were evaluated for treatment-induced hypothyroidism defined as elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone or decreased free thyroxine levels or both Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified individuals at low versus high risk based on dosimetric variables Dosimetric cutoff points were verified with an external data set of 50 patients who underwent 3D-CRT In the IMRT group most patients 75 83 had stage II HL and the median prescribed dose was 30.6 Gy in the 3D-CRT group 32 patients 64 had stage II HL and the median prescribed dose was 32.0 Gy No differences were found in the proportions of patients with bilateral P .982 or unilateral P .074 involvement between the 2 groups Hypothyroidism rates were marginally higher in the IMRT group with estimated 3-year rates of freedom from hypothyroidism of 56.1 in the 3D-CRT group and 40 in the IMRT group P .057 Univariate analysis showed that smaller volume and higher dose were associated with hypothyroidism in both groups P .05 In the IMRT group the percentage of the gland volume receiving ≥25 Gy V25 and the absolute volume of the gland spared from 25 Gy VS25Gy were the strongest predictors of hypothyroidism P .001 and P .001 respectively Cutoff points of 63.5 V25 and 2.2 mL VS25Gy classified patients as high risk 80 -82 or low risk 37 -44 P .001 Use of a avoidance structure reduced the incidence of hypothyroidism P .05 in the IMRT group The percentage of the receiving 25 Gy and the volume of the spared from 25 Gy predicted the risk of hypothyroidism after either IMRT or 3D-CRT for HL IMRT may confer a higher risk than 3D-CRT unless a treatment avoidance structure is used during planning,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[6, 255, 674, 1, 4147, 50, 975, 36, 9, 1718, 2, 6, 932, 123, 50, 837, 1757, 121, 36, 964, 5, 135, 50, 27, 2201, 2265, 2972, 121, 36, 1089, 2493, 7, 54, 208, 646, 606, 964, 4, 1238, 298, 1409, 11, 194, 9, 24, 277, 4147, 395, 22, 804, 11260, 2122, 785, 15, 340, 115, 21132, 148, 15, 110, 3185, 2584, 2037, 1496, 65, 108, 869, 28, 154, 185, 64, 43, 90, 23, 3187, 682, 3187, 2779, 862, 11, 4815, 5, 35, 1455, 74, 916, 1, 212, 7, 54, 208, 2265, 1089, 4, 3, 964, 87, 96, 7, 481, 852, 42, 82, 215, 1718, 2, 3, 52, 2746, 61, 10, 201, 49, 381, 4, 3, 2265, 1089, 87, 531, 7, 660, 42, 82, 215, 1718, 2, 3, 52, 2746, 61, 10, 531, 13, 381, 77, 362, 11, 204, 4, 3, 4117, 1, 7, 5, 1607, 19, 14862, 15, 3208, 19, 16410, 799, 59, 3, 18, 271, 4147, 151, 11, 5007, 142, 4, 3, 964, 87, 5, 661, 27, 111, 151, 1, 3060, 29, 4147, 1, 664, 14, 4, 3, 2265, 1089, 87, 2, 327, 4, 3, 964, 87, 19, 10807, 880, 65, 224, 17, 2170, 433, 2, 142, 61, 11, 41, 5, 4147, 4, 110, 271, 19, 474, 4, 3, 964, 87, 3, 1150, 1, 3, 2326, 433, 357, 11056, 381, 18652, 2, 3, 1766, 433, 1, 3, 2326, 6830, 29, 243, 381, 51015, 11, 3, 3311, 674, 1, 4147, 19, 144, 2, 19, 144, 106, 2779, 862, 1, 676, 33, 18652, 2, 18, 18, 542, 51015, 1373, 7, 22, 64, 43, 493, 878, 15, 154, 43, 567, 584, 19, 144, 119, 1, 8, 5863, 2772, 405, 3, 287, 1, 4147, 19, 474, 4, 3, 964, 87, 3, 1150, 1, 3, 357, 243, 381, 2, 3, 433, 1, 3, 6830, 29, 243, 381, 783, 3, 43, 1, 4147, 50, 361, 964, 15, 2265, 1089, 9, 1718, 964, 68, 2913, 8, 142, 43, 76, 2265, 1089, 6179, 8, 24, 5863, 2772, 16, 95, 190, 1349]",1953.0,29681481,176
Cancer incidence and mortality patterns in Luwan district of Shanghai during 2002-2011.,Drug discoveries & therapeutics,Drug Discov Ther,2018-04-22,"Cancer has become the leading cause of death and a major burden to public health in China. The current study analyzed the composition, incidence, mortality, and temporal trends for some major cancer types among permanent residents in Luwan district of Shanghai from 2002 to 2011, so as to provide data for cancer research. Data were collected from the database of cancer registration and management system in Shanghai. Number of new cases, number of deaths, incidence, and mortality of each cancer type were calculated. The incidence and mortality rates were standardized. Temporal trends in the incidence and mortality were assessed using average annual percent change. There were 12,843 new cancer cases and 8,331 deaths from cancer in Luwan from January 2002 to December 2011. Age-standardized incidence rates by Segi's standard were 229.46 and 205.05 per 100,000 population for males and females, respectively. For males, the most commonly diagnosed cancers were lung, colorectal, stomach, liver, prostate, bladder, pancreas, kidney, lymphoma, and esophageal cancers; for females, they were breast, colorectal, lung, stomach, thyroid, liver, ovary, pancreas, uterus, and brain cancers. The incidence rates for all cancers combined increased significantly for both males and females from 2002 to 2011 (p < 0.05 for both). Age-standardized mortality rates were 147.04 and 90.62 per 100,000 population for males and females, respectively. The mortality rates have stayed stable during the 10-year period for both males and females (p > 0.05 for both).

Molecular Profile of Advanced Thyroid Carcinomas by Next-Generation Sequencing: Characterizing Tumors Beyond Diagnosis for Targeted Therapy.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2018-04-25,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) for molecular diagnostics allows simultaneous testing of activating oncogenes and tumor suppressor mutations in multiple signal pathways. Extended mutational profiling of advanced thyroid cancers may enhance considerations for targeted therapies. We analyzed clinically derived molecular profiling of 216 patients with advanced thyroid carcinoma using NGS (Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine) from April 2012 to February 2014. We examined substitutions and small indels in 46 or 50 cancer-related genes using Ampliseq Cancer Hotspot panel in respect to tumor diagnosis and clinical correlations.Mutations were common in advanced thyroid carcinomas 154 (71%) predominately in targetable MAPK pathway (146/216, 68%), and several PI3K/AKT pathway (8, 4%; six as comutations). <i>BRAF V600E</i> mutation associated with papillary (94/139, 68%), poorly differentiated (4/39, 10%), and anaplastic (3/12, 25%) carcinomas. <i>NRAS</i> mutations occurred in follicular (5/12, 42%) and poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (12/39, 31%). Tumor suppressor mutations (16, 7%) occurred predominantly in <i>TP53</i> in Hurthle cell (2/5, 40%, the only mutation), in anaplastic (3/12, 25%) and poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (4/39, 10%) some as comutations and in papillary thyroid carcinoma (5/139, 4%) always a comutation. Kaplan-Meier analysis of patients with poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma containing activating mutations who received targeted therapeutics showed improved survival compared to similarly treated patients without mutations in targetable pathways (<i>P</i> = 0.02). In conclusion, MAPK pathway is the predominant target for therapy in advance thyroid carcinomas; adding NGS enables the identification of comutations associated with resistance (<i>PI3K/AKT</i>).

Management of treatment-related toxicities in advanced medullary thyroid cancer.,Cancer treatment reviews,Cancer Treat. Rev.,2018-04-22,"Progress in the treatment of advanced medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) has resulted from the approval of 2 drugs within the past 5 years, vandetanib and cabozantinib. These multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) possess overlapping specificities for multiple kinase targets implicated in the progression of MTC. Both drugs are associated with toxicities, including hypertension, hemorrhage/perforation, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal events, several dermatologic events, and hypothyroidism. In addition, vandetanib is uniquely associated with QTc prolongation through interaction with myocardial potassium channels, and cabozantinib is uniquely associated with hand-foot skin reaction. Treatment-related toxicities occur frequently and can be severe or life-threatening, and patients undergoing long-term treatment will likely experience adverse events (AEs). Here we offer specific practical recommendations for managing AEs commonly occurring with vandetanib and cabozantinib. The recommended approach relies on early recognition and palliation of symptoms, dose interruption, and dose reduction as necessary in order for the patient to maintain the highest tolerable dose for as long as possible and optimal quality of life. Treatment guidelines do not specify a recommended sequence for treating with vandetanib and cabozantinib; however, most patients will receive both drugs during their lifetime. The choice for first-line therapy is individualized after a risk-benefit assessment and depends on physician preference and patient-related factors, such as comorbid conditions. Because most generalist practices may not be familiar with the intricacies of agents such as vandetanib and cabozantinib, we commend that patients with advanced MTC be managed and treated by a thyroid cancer specialist with coordination of care within a multidisciplinary team.",Journal Article,639.0,11.0,Progress in the treatment of advanced medullary cancer MTC has resulted from the approval of 2 drugs within the past 5 years vandetanib and cabozantinib These multikinase inhibitors MKIs possess overlapping specificities for multiple kinase targets implicated in the progression of MTC Both drugs are associated with toxicities including hypertension hemorrhage/perforation diarrhea and other events several dermatologic events and hypothyroidism In addition vandetanib is uniquely associated with QTc prolongation through interaction with myocardial potassium channels and cabozantinib is uniquely associated with hand-foot reaction Treatment-related toxicities occur frequently and can be severe or life-threatening and patients undergoing long-term treatment will likely experience adverse events AEs Here we offer specific practical recommendations for managing AEs commonly occurring with vandetanib and cabozantinib The recommended approach relies on early recognition and palliation of symptoms dose interruption and dose reduction as necessary in order for the patient to maintain the highest tolerable dose for as long as possible and optimal quality of life Treatment guidelines do not specify a recommended sequence for treating with vandetanib and cabozantinib however most patients will receive both drugs during their lifetime The choice for first-line therapy is individualized after a risk-benefit assessment and depends on physician preference and patient-related factors such as comorbid conditions Because most generalist practices may not be familiar with the intricacies of agents such as vandetanib and cabozantinib we commend that patients with advanced MTC be managed and treated by a cancer specialist with coordination of care within a multidisciplinary team,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[1466, 4, 3, 24, 1, 131, 4564, 12, 3959, 71, 627, 29, 3, 1814, 1, 18, 600, 262, 3, 1219, 33, 60, 3493, 2, 3048, 46, 6524, 222, 28837, 5766, 4551, 10571, 9, 232, 216, 637, 1771, 4, 3, 91, 1, 3959, 110, 600, 32, 41, 5, 385, 141, 1824, 3599, 4854, 1172, 2, 127, 281, 392, 4722, 281, 2, 4147, 4, 352, 3493, 16, 7089, 41, 5, 6725, 4464, 298, 915, 5, 5098, 13036, 11317, 2, 3048, 16, 7089, 41, 5, 2833, 4100, 1329, 24, 139, 385, 1271, 746, 2, 122, 40, 905, 15, 358, 3691, 2, 7, 479, 319, 337, 24, 303, 322, 730, 290, 281, 1477, 467, 21, 1918, 112, 3320, 883, 9, 3969, 1477, 841, 1821, 5, 3493, 2, 3048, 3, 793, 353, 6495, 23, 191, 2335, 2, 3695, 1, 507, 61, 4823, 2, 61, 628, 22, 1493, 4, 1732, 9, 3, 69, 6, 3040, 3, 1076, 2668, 61, 9, 22, 319, 22, 899, 2, 665, 372, 1, 358, 24, 677, 1022, 44, 16038, 8, 793, 1532, 9, 1367, 5, 3493, 2, 3048, 137, 96, 7, 303, 560, 110, 600, 190, 136, 2898, 3, 1866, 9, 157, 328, 36, 16, 2596, 50, 8, 43, 247, 455, 2, 3828, 23, 1473, 3863, 2, 69, 139, 130, 225, 22, 3952, 1298, 408, 96, 39338, 2634, 68, 44, 40, 8381, 5, 3, 28475, 1, 183, 225, 22, 3493, 2, 3048, 21, 72640, 17, 7, 5, 131, 3959, 40, 2231, 2, 73, 20, 8, 12, 6554, 5, 6373, 1, 165, 262, 8, 1643, 2870]",1784.0,29704768,221

Hypothyroidism after Radiation Therapy for Childhood Cancer: A Report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,Radiation research,Radiat. Res.,2018-05-15,"While thyroid cancer risks from exposure to ionizing radiation early in life are well characterized quantitatively, the association of radiation with nonmalignant, functional thyroid disorders has been less studied. Here, we report on a risk analysis study of hypothyroidism with radiation dose to the thyroid gland and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis among survivors of childhood cancer. Utilizing data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, a cohort of 14,364 five-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed at 26 hospitals in the U.S. and Canada between 1970 and 1986 and followed through 2009, the occurrence of hypothyroidism was ascertained among 12,015 survivors through serial questionnaires. Radiation doses to the thyroid gland and pituitary gland were estimated from radiotherapy records. Binary outcome regression was used to estimate prevalence odds ratios for hypothyroidism at five years from diagnosis of childhood cancer and Poisson regression to model incidence rate ratios (RR) after the first five years. A total of 1,193 cases of hypothyroidism were observed, 777 (65%) of which occurred five or more years after cancer diagnosis. The cumulative proportion affected with hypothyroidism (prevalence at five years after cancer diagnosis plus incidence through 30 years after cancer diagnosis) was highest among five-year survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma (32.3%; 95% CI: 29.5-34.9) and cancers of the central nervous system (17.7%; 95% CI: 15.2-20.4). The incidence rate was significantly associated with radiation dose to the thyroid and pituitary. The joint association of hypothyroidism with thyroid and pituitary dose was sub-additive for pituitary doses greater than 16 Gy. In particular, a very strong thyroid radiation dose dependence at low-to-moderate pituitary/hypothalamic doses was diminished at high pituitary doses. Radiation-related risks were higher in males than females and inversely associated with age at exposure and time since exposure but remained elevated more than 25 years after exposure. Our findings indicated that hypothyroidism was significantly associated with treatment with bleomycin (RR = 3.4; 95% CI: 1.6-7.3) and the alkylating agents cyclohexyl-chloroethyl-nitrosourea (CCNU) (RR = 3.0; 95% CI: 1.5-5.3) and cyclophosphamide (RR = 1.3; 95% CI: 1.0-1.8), with a significant dose response for CCNU ( P < 0.01). The risk of hypothyroidism among childhood cancer survivors treated with radiation depends both on direct, dose-dependent radiation-induced damage to the thyroid gland and on dose-dependent indirect effects secondary to irradiation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The dose-response relationship for each site depends on dose to the other. Radiation-related risk persists for more than 25 years after treatment.

Incidence of Thyroid Function Test Abnormalities in Patients Receiving Immune-Checkpoint Inhibitors for Cancer Treatment.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2018-05-16,"With the advent of immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy (anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1), immune-related adverse events such as thyroid function test abnormalities (TFTAs) are common, with a reported incidence range of 2%-15% depending upon the ICI used. The aim of this study is to describe the incidence of TFTAs retrospectively in patients who received ICI therapy. A total of 285 patients were reviewed (178 male, 107 female; 16-94 years of age), of whom 218 had no baseline TFTAs, 61 had baseline TFTAs, and 6 had a history of thyroidectomy (excluded). At least one dose of ipilimumab and/or nivolumab or pembrolizumab was administered. Post-ICI therapy TFTAs were classified according to standard definitions of thyroid conditions when possible. A total of 35% (76/218) patients had new-onset TFTAs on ICI therapy. Of note, 70.5% (43/61) had baseline TFTAs that were exacerbated by ICI therapy. The median times to new-onset or exacerbated baseline TFTA were 46 and 33 days, respectively. Of note, 64.5% (20/31) of patients on both ipilimumab and nivolumab had new-onset TFTAs, compared with 31.3% (15/48) on ipilimumab, 31.5% (28/89) on nivolumab, and 26% (13/50) on pembrolizumab. The incidence of TFTAs with ICI therapy was higher than previously reported. Patients with baseline TFTAs and/or who were receiving ipilimumab and nivolumab combination therapy had a higher incidence of TFTAs than patients receiving single-agent ICI therapy. We recommend more frequent evaluation of thyroid function in the first 8 weeks, especially in patients with baseline TFTAs. Increased use of immune-checkpoint inhibitors in cancer treatment has highlighted the importance of monitoring for and treating immune-related adverse events. This study was conducted to assess the incidence of thyroid function test abnormalities retrospectively in patients with cancer on immune-checkpoint inhibitors, which is not known exactly. This study is unique in that it included patients with a variety of histologic subtypes of cancer and also followed the clinical course of patients with baseline thyroid function test abnormalities. This study can help make oncologists aware that the incidence of thyroid function test abnormalities is higher than anticipated.

Hypofractionated Radiotherapy Is Superior to Conventional Fractionation in an Orthotopic Model of Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2018-06-01,"Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is an aggressive and highly lethal disease with poor outcomes and resistance to therapy. Despite multimodality treatment, including radiation therapy and chemotherapy, response rates remain <15%, with a median time to progression of less than three months. Recent advances in radiotherapy (RT) delivery and gene-expression profiling may help guide patient selection for personalized therapy. The purpose of this study was to characterize the response to radiation in a panel of ATC cell lines and to test alternative RT fractionation schedules for overcoming radioresistance. The cellular response to radiation was characterized based on clonogenic assays. Radiation response was correlated with microarray gene-expression data. Hypofractionated and conventional RT was tested in an orthotopic ATC tumor model, and tumor growth was assayed locally and distantly with in vivo and ex vivo bioluminescence imaging. A spectrum of radiosensitivities was observed in ATC cell lines. Radioresistant cell lines had higher levels of CXCR4 compared to radiosensitive cell lines. Compared to conventionally fractionated RT, hypofractionated RT resulted in significantly improved tumor growth delay, decreased regional and distant metastases, and improved overall survival. The findings demonstrate the heterogeneity of response to radiation in ATC tumors and the superiority of hypofractionated RT in improving local control, metastatic spread, and survival in preclinical models.

A VMAT planning technique for locally advanced breast cancer patients with expander or implant reconstructions requiring comprehensive postmastectomy radiation therapy.,Medical dosimetry : official journal of the American Association of Medical Dosimetrists,Med Dosim,2018-05-22,"Locally advanced breast cancer patients with expander or implant reconstructions who require comprehensive postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) can pose unique treatment planning challenges. Traditional 3D conformal radiation techniques often result in large dose inhomogeneity throughout the treatment volumes, inadequate target coverage, or excessive normal tissue doses. We have developed a volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) planning technique without entering through the ipsilateral arm that produced adequate target volume coverage, excellent homogeneity throughout the target volume, and acceptable doses to the normal structures. Twenty left-sided and 10 right-sided patients with either ipsilateral or bilateral permanent implants or tissue expanders who received comprehensive PMRT between October 2014 and February 2016 were included in this study. Ten left-sided cases used deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) technique, and others used free breathing (FB). Planning target volume (PTV) included chestwall, internal mammary nodes (IMNs), supraclavicular, and axillary lymph nodes. A VMAT plan using 4 or 5 partial arcs with 6 MV photon beam avoiding entering through the ipsilateral arm was generated for each patient. Prescription dose was 50 Gy in 25 fractions. PTV coverage, maximum depth of IMNs, dose homogeneity and dose to the heart, lungs, thyroid, contralateral intact breast or implant, liver, stomach, left anterior descending artery, ipsilateral brachial plexus, esophagus, spinal cord, and total MU were evaluated.

Defining Survivorship Trajectories Across Patients With Solid Tumors: An Evidence-Based Approach.,JAMA oncology,JAMA Oncol,2018-11-01,"Survivorship involves a multidisciplinary approach to surveillance and management of comorbidities and secondary cancers, overseen by oncologists, surgeons, and primary care physicians. Optimal timing and coordination of care, however, is unclear and often based on arbitrary 5-year cutoffs. To determine high- and low-risk periods for all tumor types that could define when survivorship care might best be overseen by oncologists and when to transition to primary care physicians. In this pan-cancer, longitudinal, observational study, excess mortality hazard, calculated as an annualized mortality risk above a baseline population, was plotted over time. The time this hazard took to stabilize defined a high-risk period. The percent morality elevation above age- and sex-matched controls in the latter low-risk period was reported as a mortality gap. The US population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database defined the cancer population, and the US Census life tables defined controls. Incident cases of patients with cancer were separated into tumor types based on International Classification of Diseases for Oncology definitions. Population-level data on incident cancer cases was compared with the general US population. Overall mortality and cause of death were reported on observed cancer cases. A total of 2 317 185 patients (median age, 63 years; 49.8% female) with 66 primary tumor types were evaluated. High-risk surveillance period durations ranged from less than 1 year (breast, prostate, lip, ocular, and parathyroid cancers) up to 19 years (unspecified gastrointestinal cancers). The annualized mortality gap, representing the excess mortality in the stable period, ranged from a median 0.26% to 9.33% excess annual mortality (thyroid and hypopharyngeal cancer populations, respectively). Cluster analysis produced 6 risk cluster groups: group 1, with median survival of 16.2 (5th to 95th percentile range [PR], 10.7-40.2) years and median high-risk period of 2.5 (PR, 0-5.0) years; group 2, 8.3 (PR, 5.1-23.3) and 2.5 (PR, 4.0-8.0) years; group 3, 2.8 (PR, 1.4-3.7) and 7.0 (PR, 6.0-11.1) years; group 4, 1.6 (PR, 1.5-1.8) and 6.0 (PR, 5.1-11.4) years; group 5, 0.8 (PR, 0.5-1.2) and 0.8 (PR, 0.5-1.2) years; and group 6, 0.5 (PR, 0.4-0.8) and 12.0 (PR, 9.3-12.9) years, respectively. Subanalyses of selected tumor types in these groups revealed that stratifying on stage and histologic type can change the risk cluster and guidance for care. These findings indicate that a standardized 5-year surveillance period is inadequate for some cancers while excessive for others. High-risk cancers require the most resources with the longest high-risk period, highest persistent baseline mortality risk, and longest period of primary cancer mortality, all arguing for longer

"Safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of E6201 in patients with advanced solid tumours, including melanoma: results of a phase 1 study.",British journal of cancer,Br. J. Cancer,2018-06-05,"This phase 1 first-in-human study aimed to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities, and safety of E6201, and to establish recommended dosing in patients with advanced solid tumours, expanded to advanced melanoma. Part A (dose escalation): sequential cohorts received E6201 intravenously (IV) over 30 min (once-weekly [qw; days (D)1 + 8 + 15 of a 28-day cycle]), starting at 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, increasing to 720 mg/m<sup>2</sup> or the MTD. Part B (expansion): patients with BRAF-mutated or wild-type (WT) melanoma received E6201 320 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV over 60 minutes qw (D1 + 8 + 15 of a 28-day cycle) or 160 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV twice-weekly (D1 + 4 + 8 + 11 + 15 + 18 of a 28-day cycle; BRAF-mutated only). MTD in Part A (n = 25) was 320 mg/m<sup>2</sup> qw, confirmed in Part B (n = 30). Adverse events included QT prolongation (n = 4) and eye disorders (n = 3).

Potent effects of roniciclib alone and with sorafenib against well-differentiated thyroid cancer.,Endocrine-related cancer,Endocr. Relat. Cancer,2018-06-12,"Activation of cyclin-dependent kinase activity is frequently observed in many human cancers; therefore, cyclin-dependent kinases that promote cell cycle transition and cell proliferation may be potential targets in the treatment of malignancy. The therapeutic effects of roniciclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor for papillary and follicular thyroid cancer (designated as well-differentiated thyroid cancer), were investigated in this study. Roniciclib inhibited cell proliferation in two papillary and two follicular thyroid cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Roniciclib activated caspase-3 activity and induced apoptosis. Cell cycle progression was arrested in the G2/M phase. Roniciclib treatment <i>in vivo</i> retarded the growth of two well-differentiated thyroid tumors in xenograft models in a dose-dependent fashion. Furthermore, the combination of roniciclib with sorafenib was more effective than either single treatment in a follicular thyroid cancer xenograft model. Acceptable safety profiles appeared in animals treated with either roniciclib alone or roniciclib and sorafenib combination therapy.

All consecutive patients treated by the senior author who were receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors and developed TED-like orbital inflammation were included. Three cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors developed orbital inflammation. The first patient was treated with a combination of a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 inhibitor and a programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor and developed TED-like orbital inflammation with normal thyroid function and antibody levels. The second patient had a previous diagnosis of Graves disease without TED, and developed TED soon after initiating treatment with a programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor.

Effect of Tumor Size and Minimal Extrathyroidal Extension in Patients with Differentiated Thyroid Cancer.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2018-07-27,"Risk-stratified treatment strategies have become a focus in the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). In the 2015 American Thyroid Association treatment guidelines, adjuvant treatment with radioactive iodine (RAI) is considered in the presence of minimal extrathyroidal extension (mETE). This study aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of mETE and tumor size in patients with DTC. A retrospective review was undertaken of 2323 consecutive patients treated surgically for T1-T3 (defined per seventh edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging criteria) and M0 DTC from 2000 to 2015 at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Patients were divided into four groups according to the size of the tumor (≤4 cm vs. >4 cm) and the presence of mETE. Predictors of disease-free survival (DFS), disease-specific survival, locoregional failure (LRF), and distant metastatic failure (DMF) were compared using the log-rank test and Cox's proportional hazards models. There were only seven DTC-related deaths, limiting the clinical significance of the analysis, especially of overall and disease-specific survival. Following multivariate analysis, patients with tumors >4 cm did worse than patients with tumors ≤4 cm with respect to DFS (group 3 [>4 cm without mETE] adjusted hazard ratio (HR<sub>adj</sub>) = 2.1 [confidence interval (CI) 1.1-3.8]; group 4 [>4 cm with mETE] HR<sub>adj</sub> = 2.9 [CI 1.6-5.1]). However, patients did not differ according to DFS, regardless of the presence of mETE within each size category (group 2 [≤4 cm with mETE] vs. group 1 [≤4 cm without mETE] HR<sub>adj</sub> = 1.3 [CI 0.9-1.8]; group 4 [>4 cm without mETE] vs. group 3 [>4 cm with mETE] HR<sub>adj</sub> = 1.0 [CI 0.5-2.3]).

The role of next-generation sequencing in the differential diagnosis of composite neoplasms.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2018-06-26,"Composite neoplasms (CNs) are rare and diagnostically challenging lesions that require differentiating between mixed clonal tumors with divergent phenotypes (MT), collision of 2 independent tumors adjacent to each other (CT), and tumor-to-tumor metastasis (TTM). To that end, pathologists have traditionally used immunohistochemistry and limited molecular studies, such as Sanger sequencing. Herein we evaluate the potential application of NGS in the differential diagnosis of these rare neoplasms. Four CNs were included in the study. Two were diagnosed as MT (mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma of the gallbladder and metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma with squamous dedifferentiation) and 2 were interpreted as TTM (esophageal adenocarcinoma to lung adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma of the lung to meningeal melanoma). Diagnoses were made using clinical, histologic, and immunophenotypic information, with the aid of limited molecular studies in 2 cases. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was dissected for DNA and RNA extraction, and NGS was performed using the Oncomine Comprehensive Panel.

NGS results for the lesion diagnosed as esophageal adenocarcinoma metastatic to lung adenocarcinoma did not support the histopathologic interpretation and were deemed inconclusive.

Salvage pembrolizumab added to kinase inhibitor therapy for the treatment of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,J Immunother Cancer,2018-07-11,"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a rare but deadly form of thyroid cancer. Kinase inhibitors kinase inhibitors have shown clinical efficacy in the management of ATC, however, eventually these tumors acquire resistance to KI and patients succumb to their disease. Salvage therapy in this setting is limited. As ATC tumors diffusely express the programmed cell death protein ligand (PD-L1), anti- programmed cell death protein (PD-1) drugs such as pembrolizumab offer therapeutic potential. We sought to explore the efficacy of adding pembrolizumab to kinase inhibitors at progression in ATC. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of ATC patients initiated on pembrolizumab in combination with KI at the time of progression on kinase inhibitors at MD Anderson Cancer Center between August 2016 and August 2017. Efficacy was evaluated with best overall response (BOR) using RECISTv1.1 criteria. Progression free survival (PFS) from the start of pembrolizumab and overall survival (OS) from the start of kinase inhibitors, as well as from the time of addition of pembrolizumab were calculated. Twelve patients were treated with combination kinase inhibitors plus pembrolizumab at the time of progression on their KI therapy. Median age at initiation of pembrolizumab was 60 years (range 47-84 years). BOR was as follows: 5/12 (42%) had partial response, 4/12 (33%) had stable disease and 3/12 (25%) had progressive disease. Median OS from the start of kinase inhibitor was 10.43 months (95% CI = 6.02, 14.83, range 5.4-40 months). Median OS and PFS from the addition of pembrolizumab were 6.93 months (95% CI = 1.7, 12.15, range 3-15.9 months) and 2.96 months (95% CI = 2.2, 3.7, range 0.57-13.14 months), respectively. Fatigue, anemia and hypertension were the most common AEs encountered on these combinations. Therapy had to be discontinued in 2 patients due to drug induced rash and altered mental status likely from progression of disease. In a subset of ATC patients, pembrolizumab may be an effective salvage therapy added to kinase inhibitors at the time of progression on these drugs. However, better treatment strategies aimed at incorporating immunotherapy in patients with ATC should be explored. Frontline combination of KI with immunotherapy should be studied in prospective clinical trials.",Journal Article,559.0,22.0,Anaplastic carcinoma ATC is a rare but deadly form of cancer Kinase inhibitors kinase inhibitors have shown clinical efficacy in the management of ATC however eventually these tumors acquire resistance to KI and patients succumb to their disease Salvage therapy in this setting is limited As ATC tumors diffusely express the programmed cell death protein ligand PD-L1 anti- programmed cell death protein PD-1 drugs such as pembrolizumab offer therapeutic potential We sought to explore the efficacy of adding pembrolizumab to kinase inhibitors at progression in ATC We retrospectively reviewed the charts of ATC patients initiated on pembrolizumab in combination with KI at the time of progression on kinase inhibitors at MD Anderson Cancer Center between August 2016 and August 2017 Efficacy was evaluated with best overall response BOR using RECISTv1.1 criteria Progression free survival PFS from the start of pembrolizumab and overall survival OS from the start of kinase inhibitors as well as from the time of addition of pembrolizumab were calculated Twelve patients were treated with combination kinase inhibitors plus pembrolizumab at the time of progression on their KI therapy Median age at initiation of pembrolizumab was 60 years range 47-84 years BOR was as follows 5/12 42 had partial response 4/12 33 had stable disease and 3/12 25 had progressive disease Median OS from the start of kinase inhibitor was 10.43 months 95 CI 6.02 14.83 range 5.4-40 months Median OS and PFS from the addition of pembrolizumab were 6.93 months 95 CI 1.7 12.15 range 3-15.9 months and 2.96 months 95 CI 2.2 3.7 range 0.57-13.14 months respectively Fatigue anemia and hypertension were the most common AEs encountered on these combinations Therapy had to be discontinued in 2 patients due to drug induced rash and altered mental status likely from progression of disease In a subset of ATC patients pembrolizumab may be an effective salvage therapy added to kinase inhibitors at the time of progression on these drugs However better treatment strategies aimed at incorporating immunotherapy in patients with ATC should be explored Frontline combination of KI with immunotherapy should be studied in prospective clinical trials,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[1841, 134, 3871, 16, 8, 622, 84, 6610, 1297, 1, 12, 216, 222, 216, 222, 47, 443, 38, 209, 4, 3, 284, 1, 3871, 137, 3124, 46, 57, 6206, 251, 6, 2311, 2, 7, 9025, 6, 136, 34, 992, 36, 4, 26, 546, 16, 383, 22, 3871, 57, 9333, 1669, 3, 1846, 31, 273, 178, 1232, 333, 729, 312, 1846, 31, 273, 178, 333, 14, 600, 225, 22, 2233, 1918, 189, 174, 21, 990, 6, 1645, 3, 209, 1, 2726, 2233, 6, 216, 222, 28, 91, 4, 3871, 21, 894, 446, 3, 4413, 1, 3871, 7, 1917, 23, 2233, 4, 150, 5, 2311, 28, 3, 98, 1, 91, 23, 216, 222, 28, 2244, 1929, 12, 574, 59, 2480, 1390, 2, 2480, 1759, 209, 10, 194, 5, 824, 63, 51, 19390, 75, 40525, 14, 371, 91, 115, 25, 300, 29, 3, 2435, 1, 2233, 2, 63, 25, 118, 29, 3, 2435, 1, 216, 222, 22, 149, 22, 29, 3, 98, 1, 352, 1, 2233, 11, 981, 2544, 7, 11, 73, 5, 150, 216, 222, 349, 2233, 28, 3, 98, 1, 91, 23, 136, 2311, 36, 52, 89, 28, 1118, 1, 2233, 10, 335, 60, 184, 662, 874, 60, 19390, 10, 22, 2962, 33, 133, 595, 42, 450, 51, 39, 133, 466, 42, 585, 34, 2, 27, 133, 243, 42, 1014, 34, 52, 118, 29, 3, 2435, 1, 216, 230, 10, 79, 601, 53, 48, 58, 49, 588, 213, 852, 184, 33, 39, 327, 53, 52, 118, 2, 300, 29, 3, 352, 1, 2233, 11, 49, 966, 53, 48, 58, 14, 67, 133, 167, 184, 27, 167, 83, 53, 2, 18, 921, 53, 48, 58, 18, 18, 27, 67, 184, 13, 696, 233, 213, 53, 106, 613, 1545, 2, 1824, 11, 3, 96, 186, 1477, 3903, 23, 46, 1247, 36, 42, 6, 40, 2402, 4, 18, 7, 520, 6, 234, 277, 1641, 2, 1495, 3031, 156, 322, 29, 91, 1, 34, 4, 8, 697, 1, 3871, 7, 2233, 68, 40, 35, 323, 992, 36, 1953, 6, 216, 222, 28, 3, 98, 1, 91, 23, 46, 600, 137, 380, 24, 422, 1295, 28, 2570, 726, 4, 7, 5, 3871, 257, 40, 1443, 3171, 150, 1, 2311, 5, 726, 257, 40, 656, 4, 482, 38, 143]",2219.0,29996921,16
Extrathyroidal Extension: Does Strap Muscle Invasion Alone Influence Recurrence and Survival in Patients with Differentiated Thyroid Cancer?,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2018-07-18,"According to the 8th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system, extrathyroidal extension (ETE) and primary tumor size remain the principle determinants of T stage. However, impact of gross ETE into strap muscles on survival remains controversial. A retrospective review of 2084 patients with ≤ 4 cm nonmetastatic differentiated thyroid cancer who underwent surgery between 2000 and 2015 was conducted. Patients were divided into three groups according to degree of ETE: no ETE (group 1), ETE into perithyroidal soft tissue (group 2), and gross ETE into strap muscle (group 3). Survivals were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log-rank test. Factors predictive of survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard model. Ten-year disease-free survival (DFS) of patients in groups 1-3 was 90, 82, and 83%, respectively (p = 0.003). On multivariate analysis, age ≥ 55 years, male sex, and pathologic N1b category predicted significantly worse DFS, while ETE into perithyroidal soft tissue or gross strap muscle invasion did not predict worse DFS. Overall survival (p = 0.957) and disease-specific survival (p =0.910) were not significantly different between the three groups. There was a statistically significant difference in locoregional recurrence-free survival between groups 1 and 2 [HR 2.02, 95% CI 1.06-3.94].

Targeted Therapy in Advanced Thyroid Cancer to Resensitize Tumors to Radioactive Iodine.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2018-10-01,"Many differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC) dedifferentiate and become radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory (RAIR) with worse outcomes. Targeted therapy (TTx) may downregulate MAPK signaling and sensitize tumors to RAI. We describe patients with RAIR DTC receiving TTx with demonstrated RAI uptake allowing for iodine-131 (I131) administration. Charts of patients with metastatic, progressive, RAIR DTC in whom TTx increased RAI uptake on a diagnostic whole-body scan (WBS), were reviewed. Results of WBS, I131 administration, thyroglobulin (TG) panels, and cross-sectional studies were recorded. Thirteen patients [median age (range), 56 (45 to 75) years; seven men] were included; 11 (85%) had DTC, two (15%) had poorly DTC. Nine (69%) had BRAF mutations, three (23%) had RAS mutations, and one (8%) was wild type. Selective BRAF or an MEK inhibitor TTx was continued for a median (range) of 14.3 (1 to 76.4) months before diagnostic WBS. Nine (69%) patients were treated with I131 [median (range) activity, 204.4 (150 to 253) mCi], after which TTx was discontinued. Median (range) follow-up was 8.3 (0 to 17.4) months after I131 therapy. All nine patients had durable disease control (three had partial response, six had stable disease).

Elevated Risk of Cancer After Solid Organ Transplant in Childhood: A Population-based Cohort Study.,Transplantation,Transplantation,2019-03-01,"Cancer risk is elevated among adult transplant recipients, but there is limited data regarding long-term cancer risk and mortality in pediatric recipients. We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study in Ontario, Canada. We included pediatric recipients of solid organ transplants at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, from 1991 to 2014, and compared rates of new cancers and cancer-specific mortality to nontransplanted Ontario children born in the same year. We constructed standard and time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models accounting for competing risk of death. A total of 951 recipients (kidney, n = 400; liver, n = 283; heart, n = 218; lung, n = 36; multiorgan/small bowel, n = 14) were compared with 5.3 million general population children. Mean (SD) age was 8.2 (6.4) years; 50% were male. Over a mean (SD) follow-up of 10.8 (7.1) years, cumulative incidence of cancer was 20% in recipients and 1.2% in the general population (incidence rate ratio, 32.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 26.6-40.8). Risk was highest in the first year posttransplant (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR],176; 95% CI, 117-264), but remained elevated beyond 10 years (aHR, 10.8; 95% CI, 6.3-18.6). Lymphoproliferative disorders were predominant (77%); however, solid cancers (renal, sarcomas, genital, thyroid) were seen. Recipients of lung or multiorgan transplants were at highest risk. Cancer-specific mortality was also higher among recipients (HR, 93.1; 95% CI, 59.6-145.2). Childhood transplant recipients have a 30 times greater cancer incidence versus the general population.

Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy With or Without Concurrent Chemotherapy in Nonanaplastic Thyroid Cancer with Unresectable or Gross Residual Disease.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2018-09-01,"Differentiated thyroid cancer typically has an indolent clinical course but can cause significant morbidity by local progression. Oncologic surgical resection can be technically difficult due to the proximity to critical normal structures in the neck. Our objective was to review the safety, feasibility, and outcomes of definitive-intent intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and to analyze whether patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy (CC-IMRT) had higher rates of disease control and survival over IMRT alone in patients with unresectable or gross residual disease (GRD). Eighty-eight patients with GRD or unresectable nonanaplastic, nonmedullary thyroid cancer treated with definitive-intent IMRT between 2000 and 2015 were identified. Local progression-free survival (LPFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses using cox regression were used to determine the impact of clinical conditions and treatment on LPFS, DMFS, and OS. Of the 88 patients identified, 45 (51.1%) were treated CC-IMRT and 43 (48.9%) were treated with IMRT alone. All patients treated with CC-IMRT received weekly doxorubicin (10 mg/m<sup>2</sup>). The median follow-up among surviving patients was 40.3 months and 29.2 months for all patients. The LPFS at 4 years was 77.3%. Patients receiving CC-IMRT had higher LPFS compared with IMRT alone (CC-IMRT 85.8% vs. IMRT 68.8%, p = 0.036). The 4-year OS was 56.3% for all patients. Patients treated with CC-IMRT had higher OS compared to patients treated with IMRT alone (CC-IMRT 68.0% vs. IMRT 47.0%, p = 0.043). On multivariate analysis, receipt of concurrent chemotherapy was associated with a lower risk of death (HR 0.395, p = 0.019) and lower risk of local failure (HR 0.306, p = 0.042). Grade 3+ acute toxicities occurred in 23.9% of patients, the most frequent being dermatitis (18.2%) and mucositis (9.1%). 17.1% of patients required a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube during or shortly after completion of RT, with 10.1% of patients needing a PEG more than 12 months after therapy. The rates of acute and late toxicities were not statistically higher in the CC-IMRT cohort, although trends towards higher toxicity in the CC-IMRT were present for dermatitis and PEG requirement. IMRT is a safe and effective means to achieve local control in patients with unresectable or incompletely resected nonanaplastic, nonmedullary thyroid cancer. Concurrent doxorubicin was not associated with worse toxicity and should be considered in these patients given its potential to improve local control and overall survival.",Journal Article,507.0,3.0,Differentiated cancer typically has an indolent clinical course but can cause significant morbidity by local progression Oncologic surgical resection can be technically difficult due to the proximity to critical normal structures in the Our objective was to review the safety feasibility and outcomes of definitive-intent intensity-modulated radiation therapy IMRT and to analyze whether patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy CC-IMRT had higher rates of disease control and survival over IMRT alone in patients with unresectable or gross residual disease GRD Eighty-eight patients with GRD or unresectable nonanaplastic nonmedullary cancer treated with definitive-intent IMRT between 2000 and 2015 were identified Local progression-free survival LPFS distant metastasis-free survival DMFS and overall survival OS were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method Univariate and multivariate analyses using cox regression were used to determine the impact of clinical conditions and treatment on LPFS DMFS and OS Of the 88 patients identified 45 51.1 were treated CC-IMRT and 43 48.9 were treated with IMRT alone All patients treated with CC-IMRT received weekly doxorubicin 10 mg/m sup 2 /sup The median follow-up among surviving patients was 40.3 months and 29.2 months for all patients The LPFS at 4 years was 77.3 Patients receiving CC-IMRT had higher LPFS compared with IMRT alone CC-IMRT 85.8 vs. IMRT 68.8 p 0.036 The 4-year OS was 56.3 for all patients Patients treated with CC-IMRT had higher OS compared to patients treated with IMRT alone CC-IMRT 68.0 vs. IMRT 47.0 p 0.043 On multivariate analysis receipt of concurrent chemotherapy was associated with a lower risk of death HR 0.395 p 0.019 and lower risk of local failure HR 0.306 p 0.042 Grade 3+ acute toxicities occurred in 23.9 of patients the most frequent being dermatitis 18.2 and mucositis 9.1 17.1 of patients required a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy PEG tube during or shortly after completion of RT with 10.1 of patients needing a PEG more than 12 months after therapy The rates of acute and late toxicities were not statistically higher in the CC-IMRT cohort although trends towards higher toxicity in the CC-IMRT were present for dermatitis and PEG requirement IMRT is a safe and effective means to achieve local control in patients with unresectable or incompletely resected nonanaplastic nonmedullary cancer Concurrent doxorubicin was not associated with worse toxicity and should be considered in these patients given its potential to improve local control and overall survival,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[1442, 12, 1969, 71, 35, 2316, 38, 906, 84, 122, 708, 93, 787, 20, 293, 91, 1998, 221, 170, 122, 40, 6093, 1740, 520, 6, 3, 6167, 6, 740, 295, 2414, 4, 3, 114, 461, 10, 6, 206, 3, 367, 1437, 2, 123, 1, 1057, 1697, 837, 1757, 121, 36, 964, 2, 6, 1992, 317, 7, 357, 750, 56, 1951, 964, 42, 142, 151, 1, 34, 182, 2, 25, 252, 964, 279, 4, 7, 5, 1468, 15, 1789, 753, 34, 26854, 2207, 659, 7, 5, 26854, 15, 1468, 25106, 18984, 12, 73, 5, 1057, 1697, 964, 59, 1081, 2, 1483, 11, 108, 293, 91, 115, 25, 12044, 626, 278, 115, 25, 5930, 2, 63, 25, 118, 11, 194, 75, 3, 876, 882, 596, 880, 2, 331, 318, 75, 418, 320, 11, 95, 6, 223, 3, 345, 1, 38, 1298, 2, 24, 23, 12044, 5930, 2, 118, 1, 3, 889, 7, 108, 512, 725, 14, 11, 73, 1951, 964, 2, 601, 576, 83, 11, 73, 5, 964, 279, 62, 7, 73, 5, 1951, 964, 103, 709, 856, 79, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 3, 52, 166, 126, 107, 3050, 7, 10, 327, 27, 53, 2, 462, 18, 53, 9, 62, 7, 3, 12044, 28, 39, 60, 10, 849, 27, 7, 357, 1951, 964, 42, 142, 12044, 72, 5, 964, 279, 1951, 964, 772, 66, 105, 964, 806, 66, 19, 13, 5395, 3, 39, 111, 118, 10, 664, 27, 9, 62, 7, 7, 73, 5, 1951, 964, 42, 142, 118, 72, 6, 7, 73, 5, 964, 279, 1951, 964, 806, 13, 105, 964, 662, 13, 19, 13, 5653, 23, 331, 65, 1699, 1, 750, 56, 10, 41, 5, 8, 280, 43, 1, 273, 168, 13, 10300, 19, 13, 4049, 2, 280, 43, 1, 293, 496, 168, 13, 9974, 19, 13, 5606, 88, 27, 286, 385, 489, 4, 382, 83, 1, 7, 3, 96, 908, 486, 5236, 203, 18, 2, 2606, 83, 14, 269, 14, 1, 7, 616, 8, 3720, 2056, 6983, 3145, 2330, 190, 15, 6961, 50, 1438, 1, 240, 5, 79, 14, 1, 7, 12864, 8, 3145, 80, 76, 133, 53, 50, 36, 3, 151, 1, 286, 2, 807, 385, 11, 44, 712, 142, 4, 3, 1951, 964, 180, 242, 1963, 3113, 142, 155, 4, 3, 1951, 964, 11, 364, 9, 5236, 2, 3145, 4701, 964, 16, 8, 1165, 2, 323, 2263, 6, 1359, 293, 182, 4, 7, 5, 1468, 15, 5252, 1133, 25106, 18984, 12, 750, 856, 10, 44, 41, 5, 639, 155, 2, 257, 40, 515, 4, 46, 7, 447, 211, 174, 6, 401, 293, 182, 2, 63, 25]",2562.0,30105947,486

We retrospectively reviewed 2579 differentiated thyroid cancer patients who underwent surgery at MD Anderson Cancer Center between 2000 and 2015. Disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log rank test. The effect of potential predictor was estimated using Cox proportional hazards model. Power of survival prediction was estimated using Harrell's C concordance index (C-index), and predictive capacities for DSS were estimated using proportion of variance explained (PVE). Revision of tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) categories, age cutoff, and stage reassignment in the 8<sup>th</sup> edition caused reclassification of overall stage compared with the seventh edition. The proportion of patients in stage I and II increased from 62% to 83% and 5% to 12%, respectively, while the proportion of patients in stage III and IV decreased from 20% to 2% and 14% to 3%, respectively. Ten-year DSS for stages I-IV based on the seventh edition were 100%, 97.5%, 98.3%, and 82.6%, respectively, while 10-year DSS for the corresponding stage in the eighth edition were 99.8%, 88.3%, 72.4%, and 71.9%, respectively. In multivariate analysis for both seventh edition (C-index 0.94, PVE 4.6%) and eighth edition (C-index 0.94, PVE 4.8%), the factors predictive of worse outcome for DSS were older age, advanced tumor size category, and distant metastasis while cervical lymph node metastases did not predict worse survival. For the eighth edition, patients <55 years of age with stage II disease had significantly worse DSS (p < 0.001) than patients ≥55 years with stage II disease but appeared to be similar to patients ≥55 years with stage III (p = 0.742) and IV disease (p = 0.566). Patients ≥55 years old with T3a and T3b disease had 10-year DSS of 67% and 92%, respectively (p = 0.390). The AJCC eighth edition is similar to the seventh edition in disease-specific survival prediction. Potential modifications that may improve disease-specific survival prediction in future renditions include reconsideration of T3b tumor category and upstaging classification of patients <55 years of age with distant metastases.",Journal Article,477.0,10.0,The American Joint Committee on Cancer Cancer Staging System for differentiated cancer has been recently revised The purpose of this study was to compare survival prognostication between the seventh and eighth editions We retrospectively reviewed 2579 differentiated cancer patients who underwent surgery at MD Anderson Cancer Center between 2000 and 2015 Disease-specific survival DSS and overall survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log rank test The effect of potential predictor was estimated using Cox proportional hazards model Power of survival prediction was estimated using Harrell 's C concordance index C-index and predictive capacities for DSS were estimated using proportion of variance explained PVE Revision of tumor-node-metastasis TNM categories age cutoff and stage reassignment in the 8 sup th /sup edition caused reclassification of overall stage compared with the seventh edition The proportion of patients in stage I and II increased from 62 to 83 and 5 to 12 respectively while the proportion of patients in stage III and IV decreased from 20 to 2 and 14 to 3 respectively Ten-year DSS for stages I-IV based on the seventh edition were 100 97.5 98.3 and 82.6 respectively while 10-year DSS for the corresponding stage in the eighth edition were 99.8 88.3 72.4 and 71.9 respectively In multivariate analysis for both seventh edition C-index 0.94 PVE 4.6 and eighth edition C-index 0.94 PVE 4.8 the factors predictive of worse outcome for DSS were older age advanced tumor size category and distant metastasis while lymph node metastases did not predict worse survival For the eighth edition patients 55 years of age with stage II disease had significantly worse DSS p 0.001 than patients ≥55 years with stage II disease but appeared to be similar to patients ≥55 years with stage III p 0.742 and IV disease p 0.566 Patients ≥55 years old with T3a and T3b disease had 10-year DSS of 67 and 92 respectively p 0.390 The AJCC eighth edition is similar to the seventh edition in disease-specific survival prediction Potential modifications that may improve disease-specific survival prediction in future renditions include reconsideration of T3b tumor category and upstaging classification of patients 55 years of age with distant metastases,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,"[3, 597, 2093, 2002, 23, 12, 12, 632, 398, 9, 1442, 12, 71, 85, 761, 4218, 3, 743, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 932, 25, 4260, 59, 3, 8114, 2, 7732, 17465, 21, 894, 446, 34150, 1442, 12, 7, 54, 208, 152, 28, 2244, 1929, 12, 574, 59, 1081, 2, 1483, 34, 112, 25, 1788, 2, 63, 25, 11, 661, 75, 3, 876, 882, 596, 2, 72, 75, 1066, 1026, 412, 3, 254, 1, 174, 980, 10, 661, 75, 418, 831, 1017, 202, 2349, 1, 25, 1590, 10, 661, 75, 11214, 292, 256, 1827, 558, 256, 558, 2, 464, 14866, 9, 1788, 11, 661, 75, 920, 1, 4446, 3672, 5726, 5646, 1, 30, 289, 278, 2918, 1996, 89, 2779, 2, 82, 51212, 4, 3, 66, 172, 4517, 172, 3580, 1546, 10101, 1, 63, 82, 72, 5, 3, 8114, 3580, 3, 920, 1, 7, 4, 82, 70, 2, 215, 101, 29, 744, 6, 852, 2, 33, 6, 133, 106, 369, 3, 920, 1, 7, 4, 82, 316, 2, 478, 340, 29, 179, 6, 18, 2, 213, 6, 27, 106, 1618, 111, 1788, 9, 1153, 70, 478, 90, 23, 3, 8114, 3580, 11, 394, 1015, 33, 1096, 27, 2, 878, 49, 106, 369, 79, 111, 1788, 9, 3, 1734, 82, 4, 3, 7732, 3580, 11, 1058, 66, 889, 27, 720, 39, 2, 792, 83, 106, 4, 331, 65, 9, 110, 8114, 3580, 256, 558, 13, 960, 5726, 39, 49, 2, 7732, 3580, 256, 558, 13, 960, 5726, 39, 66, 3, 130, 464, 1, 639, 228, 9, 1788, 11, 434, 89, 131, 30, 444, 2169, 2, 626, 278, 369, 263, 289, 196, 205, 44, 678, 639, 25, 9, 3, 7732, 3580, 7, 614, 60, 1, 89, 5, 82, 215, 34, 42, 97, 639, 1788, 19, 13, 144, 76, 7, 15425, 60, 5, 82, 215, 34, 84, 2121, 6, 40, 288, 6, 7, 15425, 60, 5, 82, 316, 19, 13, 12585, 2, 478, 34, 19, 13, 14539, 7, 15425, 60, 1095, 5, 12844, 2, 14499, 34, 42, 79, 111, 1788, 1, 598, 2, 937, 106, 19, 13, 7992, 3, 2271, 7732, 3580, 16, 288, 6, 3, 8114, 3580, 4, 34, 112, 25, 1590, 174, 2916, 17, 68, 401, 34, 112, 25, 1590, 4, 508, 73464, 643, 23110, 1, 14499, 30, 2169, 2, 6335, 947, 1, 7, 614, 60, 1, 89, 5, 626, 196]",2294.0,30141373,50
Tumor copy number alteration burden is a pan-cancer prognostic factor associated with recurrence and death.,eLife,Elife,2018-09-04,"The level of copy number alteration (CNA), termed CNA burden, in the tumor genome is associated with recurrence of primary prostate cancer. Whether CNA burden is associated with prostate cancer survival or outcomes in other cancers is unknown. We analyzed the CNA landscape of conservatively treated prostate cancer in a biopsy and transurethral resection cohort, reflecting an increasingly common treatment approach. We find that CNA burden is prognostic for cancer-specific death, independent of standard clinical prognosticators. More broadly, we find CNA burden is significantly associated with disease-free and overall survival in primary breast, endometrial, renal clear cell, thyroid, and colorectal cancer in TCGA cohorts. To assess clinical applicability, we validated these findings in an independent pan-cancer cohort of patients whose tumors were sequenced using a clinically-certified next generation sequencing assay (MSK-IMPACT), where prognostic value varied based on cancer type. This prognostic association was affected by incorporating tumor purity in some cohorts. Overall, CNA burden of primary and metastatic tumors is a prognostic factor, potentially modulated by sample purity and measurable by current clinical sequencing.",Journal Article,504.0,10.0,The level of copy number alteration CNA termed CNA burden in the tumor genome is associated with recurrence of primary cancer Whether CNA burden is associated with cancer survival or outcomes in other cancers is unknown We analyzed the CNA landscape of conservatively treated cancer in a biopsy and transurethral resection cohort reflecting an increasingly common treatment approach We find that CNA burden is prognostic for cancer-specific death independent of standard clinical prognosticators More broadly we find CNA burden is significantly associated with disease-free and overall survival in primary clear cell and cancer in TCGA cohorts To assess clinical applicability we validated these findings in an independent pan-cancer cohort of patients whose tumors were sequenced using a clinically-certified next generation sequencing assay MSK-IMPACT where prognostic value varied based on cancer type This prognostic association was affected by incorporating tumor purity in some cohorts Overall CNA burden of primary and metastatic tumors is a prognostic factor potentially modulated by sample purity and measurable by current clinical sequencing,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[3, 301, 1, 1337, 207, 2611, 8986, 4183, 8986, 892, 4, 3, 30, 898, 16, 41, 5, 146, 1, 86, 12, 317, 8986, 892, 16, 41, 5, 12, 25, 15, 123, 4, 127, 163, 16, 860, 21, 311, 3, 8986, 2801, 1, 10296, 73, 12, 4, 8, 411, 2, 5079, 170, 180, 4777, 35, 1635, 186, 24, 353, 21, 2469, 17, 8986, 892, 16, 177, 9, 12, 112, 273, 306, 1, 260, 38, 9996, 80, 5482, 21, 2469, 8986, 892, 16, 97, 41, 5, 34, 115, 2, 63, 25, 4, 86, 885, 31, 2, 12, 4, 2959, 736, 6, 423, 38, 5412, 21, 938, 46, 272, 4, 35, 306, 3055, 12, 180, 1, 7, 1310, 57, 11, 4040, 75, 8, 505, 8972, 1305, 914, 615, 719, 7338, 345, 1257, 177, 549, 2051, 90, 23, 12, 267, 26, 177, 248, 10, 1424, 20, 2570, 30, 12963, 4, 476, 736, 63, 8986, 892, 1, 86, 2, 113, 57, 16, 8, 177, 161, 751, 1757, 20, 1000, 12963, 2, 1884, 20, 291, 38, 615]",1151.0,30178746,262
Targeting <i>BRAF</i> Mutations in High-Grade Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Colon.,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,2018-09-01,"Mutations in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway leading to constitutive activation and uncontrolled cellular growth have been identified in various human malignancies, making this pathway a target for potential therapeutics. The activating <i>BRAF</i><sup>V600E</sup> mutation is one well-characterized oncogenic mutation that has been described and targeted with clinical success in various malignancies, including melanoma and hairy cell leukemia. Although <i>BRAF</i>-directed treatments have yielded clinical benefit in a subset of tumor types, such as melanoma, thyroid cancer, and lung cancer, BRAF inhibition fails to confer a clinical benefit in colon cancer. Identification of patients for whom BRAF inhibition may produce clinically meaningful outcomes is imperative. The incidence of <i>BRAF</i> mutations in neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is estimated to be 5% to 10%. A recent case series demonstrated benefit in targeting the <i>BRAF</i><sup>V600E</sup> mutation in metastatic high-grade rectal NECs. Combination BRAF and MEK inhibition is known to yield improved outcomes compared with BRAF inhibition alone in melanoma. This report presents 2 patients with high-grade colorectal NECs who had different responses to treatment with combined BRAF/MEK inhibition after experiencing disease progression through first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. One patient experienced an excellent initial response to therapy before ultimately experiencing progression, and in the other patient initially had stable disease before eventually experiencing progression.

Endocrine Toxicity of Cancer Immunotherapy Targeting Immune Checkpoints.,Endocrine reviews,Endocr. Rev.,2019-02-01,"Immune checkpoints are small molecules expressed by immune cells that play critical roles in maintaining immune homeostasis. Targeting the immune checkpoints cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death 1 (PD-1) with inhibitory antibodies has demonstrated effective and durable antitumor activity in subgroups of patients with cancer. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved several immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPis) for the treatment of a broad spectrum of malignancies. Endocrinopathies have emerged as one of the most common immune-related adverse events (irAEs) of ICPi therapy. Hypophysitis, thyroid dysfunction, insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus, and primary adrenal insufficiency have been reported as irAEs due to ICPi therapy. Hypophysitis is particularly associated with anti-CTLA-4 therapy, whereas thyroid dysfunction is particularly associated with anti-PD-1 therapy. Diabetes mellitus and primary adrenal insufficiency are rare endocrine toxicities associated with ICPi therapy but can be life-threatening if not promptly recognized and treated. Notably, combination anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 therapy is associated with the highest incidence of ICPi-related endocrinopathies. The precise mechanisms underlying these endocrine irAEs remain to be elucidated. Most ICPi-related endocrinopathies occur within 12 weeks after the initiation of ICPi therapy, but several have been reported to develop several months to years after ICPi initiation.

Activating PAX gene family paralogs to complement PAX5 leukemia driver mutations.,PLoS genetics,PLoS Genet.,2018-09-14,"PAX5, one of nine members of the mammalian paired box (PAX) family of transcription factors, plays an important role in B cell development. Approximately one-third of individuals with pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) acquire heterozygous inactivating mutations of PAX5 in malignant cells, and heterozygous germline loss-of-function PAX5 mutations cause autosomal dominant predisposition to ALL. At least in mice, Pax5 is required for pre-B cell maturation, and leukemic remission occurs when Pax5 expression is restored in a Pax5-deficient mouse model of ALL. Together, these observations indicate that PAX5 deficiency reversibly drives leukemogenesis. PAX5 and its two most closely related paralogs, PAX2 and PAX8, which are not mutated in ALL, exhibit overlapping expression and function redundantly during embryonic development. However, PAX5 alone is expressed in lymphocytes, while PAX2 and PAX8 are predominantly specific to kidney and thyroid, respectively. We show that forced expression of PAX2 or PAX8 complements PAX5 loss-of-function mutation in ALL cells as determined by modulation of PAX5 target genes, restoration of immunophenotypic and morphological differentiation, and, ultimately, reduction of replicative potential. Activation of PAX5 paralogs, PAX2 or PAX8, ordinarily silenced in lymphocytes, may therefore represent a novel approach for treating PAX5-deficient ALL. In pursuit of this strategy, we took advantage of the fact that, in kidney, PAX2 is upregulated by extracellular hyperosmolarity. We found that hyperosmolarity, at potentially clinically achievable levels, transcriptionally activates endogenous PAX2 in ALL cells via a mechanism dependent on NFAT5, a transcription factor coordinating response to hyperosmolarity. We also found that hyperosmolarity upregulates residual wild type PAX5 expression in ALL cells and modulates gene expression, including in PAX5-mutant primary ALL cells. These findings specifically demonstrate that osmosensing pathways may represent a new therapeutic target for ALL and more broadly point toward the possibility of using gene paralogs to rescue mutations driving cancer and other diseases.",Journal Article,494.0,1.0,PAX5 one of nine members of the mammalian paired box PAX family of transcription factors plays an important role in B cell development Approximately one-third of individuals with pre-B acute lymphoblastic ALL acquire heterozygous inactivating mutations of PAX5 in malignant cells and heterozygous germline loss-of-function PAX5 mutations cause autosomal dominant predisposition to ALL At least in mice Pax5 is required for pre-B cell maturation and leukemic remission occurs when Pax5 expression is restored in a Pax5-deficient mouse model of ALL Together these observations indicate that PAX5 deficiency reversibly drives leukemogenesis PAX5 and its two most closely related paralogs PAX2 and PAX8 which are not mutated in ALL exhibit overlapping expression and function redundantly during embryonic development However PAX5 alone is expressed in lymphocytes while PAX2 and PAX8 are predominantly specific to and respectively We show that forced expression of PAX2 or PAX8 complements PAX5 loss-of-function mutation in ALL cells as determined by modulation of PAX5 target genes restoration of immunophenotypic and morphological differentiation and ultimately reduction of replicative potential Activation of PAX5 paralogs PAX2 or PAX8 ordinarily silenced in lymphocytes may therefore represent a novel approach for treating PAX5-deficient ALL In pursuit of this strategy we took advantage of the fact that in PAX2 is upregulated by extracellular hyperosmolarity We found that hyperosmolarity at potentially clinically achievable levels transcriptionally activates endogenous PAX2 in ALL cells via a mechanism dependent on NFAT5 a transcription factor coordinating response to hyperosmolarity We also found that hyperosmolarity upregulates residual wild type PAX5 expression in ALL cells and modulates gene expression including in PAX5-mutant primary ALL cells These findings specifically demonstrate that osmosensing pathways may represent a new therapeutic target for ALL and more broadly point toward the possibility of using gene paralogs to rescue mutations driving cancer and other diseases,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[6279, 104, 1, 762, 1684, 1, 3, 2359, 2355, 4971, 12691, 607, 1, 866, 130, 1698, 35, 305, 200, 4, 132, 31, 193, 705, 104, 1282, 1, 869, 5, 671, 132, 286, 1275, 62, 6206, 4167, 6096, 138, 1, 6279, 4, 393, 37, 2, 4167, 1009, 407, 1, 343, 6279, 138, 708, 6084, 2156, 2863, 6, 62, 28, 506, 4, 399, 6279, 16, 616, 9, 671, 132, 31, 4537, 2, 2015, 734, 1780, 198, 6279, 55, 16, 4138, 4, 8, 6279, 1971, 830, 202, 1, 62, 1162, 46, 2172, 1008, 17, 6279, 2299, 15837, 5267, 5661, 6279, 2, 211, 100, 96, 3210, 139, 22624, 15730, 2, 8958, 92, 32, 44, 1185, 4, 62, 2239, 4551, 55, 2, 343, 38702, 190, 5390, 193, 137, 6279, 279, 16, 570, 4, 1594, 369, 15730, 2, 8958, 32, 2117, 112, 6, 2, 106, 21, 514, 17, 5216, 55, 1, 15730, 15, 8958, 20576, 6279, 407, 1, 343, 258, 4, 62, 37, 22, 509, 20, 2356, 1, 6279, 283, 214, 5194, 1, 6599, 2, 4268, 910, 2, 2050, 628, 1, 14529, 174, 363, 1, 6279, 22624, 15730, 15, 8958, 49573, 5442, 4, 1594, 68, 673, 1231, 8, 229, 353, 9, 1367, 6279, 1971, 62, 4, 13649, 1, 26, 692, 21, 5060, 1874, 1, 3, 1991, 17, 4, 15730, 16, 2684, 20, 1976, 30383, 21, 204, 17, 30383, 28, 751, 505, 6171, 148, 6851, 3932, 2682, 15730, 4, 62, 37, 847, 8, 670, 470, 23, 73566, 8, 866, 161, 17428, 51, 6, 30383, 21, 120, 204, 17, 30383, 9641, 753, 955, 267, 6279, 55, 4, 62, 37, 2, 5259, 145, 55, 141, 4, 6279, 620, 86, 62, 37, 46, 272, 1225, 608, 17, 73567, 460, 68, 1231, 8, 217, 189, 283, 9, 62, 2, 80, 5482, 741, 1317, 3, 2526, 1, 75, 145, 22624, 6, 4256, 138, 4057, 12, 2, 127, 1342]",2096.0,30216339,471
A Nonpump Function of Sodium Iodide Symporter in Thyroid Cancer via Cross-talk with PTEN Signaling.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2018-09-14,"The sodium iodide symporter (NIS) is a classical iodide pump typically localized within the cell plasma membrane in thyroid cells, where NIS expression is believed to ensure success of mainstay radioiodide therapy in thyroid cancers. Although radioiodide uptake is generally reduced in thyroid cancer tissue, intracellular nonmembranous NIS has been reported to increase, suggesting that NIS serves a pump-independent function. Thyroid cancer is one of the major component cancers of Cowden syndrome, a subset of which is caused by germline mutations in <i>PTEN</i> In this study, we explored the noncanonical tumorigenic role of NIS in thyroid cancer cells in relation to PTEN signaling. PTEN knockdown in thyroid cancer cell lines stabilized intracellular NIS protein by promoting an interaction with NIS-LARG (leukemia-associated RhoA guanine exchange factor). Increased protein levels of cytoplasmic NIS enhanced RhoA activation and resulted in a promigration tumorigenic phenotype. Inhibition of NIS glycosylation through activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway contributed to mislocalization of NIS in the cytoplasm, facilitating its nonpump tumorigenic function through an interaction with LARG, which predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. Moreover, PTEN or PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling could affect DPAGT1, a glycosylating enzyme involved in the initial step of N-linked glycosylation, to inhibit glycosylation of NIS. In summary, our results elucidate a pump-independent, protumorigenic role for NIS in thyroid cancer via its cross-talk with PTEN signaling.<b>Significance:</b> A novel pump-independent protumorigenic role of nonmembranous NIS challenges the presumption that radioiodine treatment of thyroid cancer is ineffective when transmembrane NIS is not expressed. <i>Cancer Res; 78(21); 6121-33. ©2018 AACR</i>.",Journal Article,494.0,4.0,The sodium iodide symporter NIS is a classical iodide pump typically localized within the cell plasma membrane in cells where NIS expression is believed to ensure success of mainstay radioiodide therapy in cancers Although radioiodide uptake is generally reduced in cancer tissue intracellular nonmembranous NIS has been reported to increase suggesting that NIS serves a pump-independent function cancer is one of the major component cancers of Cowden syndrome a subset of which is caused by germline mutations in i PTEN /i In this study we explored the noncanonical tumorigenic role of NIS in cancer cells in relation to PTEN signaling PTEN knockdown in cancer cell lines stabilized intracellular NIS protein by promoting an interaction with NIS-LARG leukemia-associated RhoA guanine exchange factor Increased protein levels of cytoplasmic NIS enhanced RhoA activation and resulted in a promigration tumorigenic phenotype Inhibition of NIS glycosylation through activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway contributed to mislocalization of NIS in the cytoplasm facilitating its nonpump tumorigenic function through an interaction with LARG which predominantly localized in the cytoplasm Moreover PTEN or PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling could affect DPAGT1 a glycosylating enzyme involved in the initial step of N-linked glycosylation to inhibit glycosylation of NIS In summary our results elucidate a pump-independent protumorigenic role for NIS in cancer via its cross-talk with PTEN signaling. b Significance /b A novel pump-independent protumorigenic role of nonmembranous NIS challenges the presumption that radioiodine treatment of cancer is ineffective when transmembrane NIS is not expressed i Cancer Res 78 21 6121-33 ©2018 AACR /i,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[3, 4682, 8456, 20641, 7228, 16, 8, 3781, 8456, 6320, 1969, 909, 262, 3, 31, 554, 1905, 4, 37, 1257, 7228, 55, 16, 3979, 6, 3478, 1825, 1, 4041, 31044, 36, 4, 163, 242, 31044, 1135, 16, 1228, 405, 4, 12, 246, 2087, 51243, 7228, 71, 85, 210, 6, 344, 802, 17, 7228, 4711, 8, 6320, 306, 343, 12, 16, 104, 1, 3, 458, 1249, 163, 1, 5561, 681, 8, 697, 1, 92, 16, 1546, 20, 1009, 138, 4, 70, 820, 70, 4, 26, 45, 21, 1443, 3, 11174, 3795, 200, 1, 7228, 4, 12, 37, 4, 2191, 6, 820, 314, 820, 1563, 4, 12, 31, 285, 7368, 2087, 7228, 178, 20, 2388, 35, 915, 5, 7228, 51244, 2647, 41, 8884, 10079, 6695, 161, 101, 178, 148, 1, 2828, 7228, 651, 8884, 363, 2, 627, 4, 8, 73576, 3795, 1005, 297, 1, 7228, 9520, 298, 363, 1, 3, 974, 649, 873, 314, 308, 3447, 6, 16888, 1, 7228, 4, 3, 4558, 5379, 211, 73577, 3795, 343, 298, 35, 915, 5, 51244, 92, 2117, 909, 4, 3, 4558, 1393, 820, 15, 974, 649, 873, 314, 359, 1158, 73578, 8, 73579, 1644, 646, 4, 3, 388, 2458, 1, 78, 1199, 9520, 6, 1433, 9520, 1, 7228, 4, 1962, 114, 99, 3061, 8, 6320, 306, 11840, 200, 9, 7228, 4, 12, 847, 211, 1383, 6522, 5, 820, 314, 132, 724, 132, 8, 229, 6320, 306, 11840, 200, 1, 51243, 7228, 1427, 3, 30453, 17, 7211, 24, 1, 12, 16, 3957, 198, 5527, 7228, 16, 44, 570, 70, 12, 1936, 833, 239, 73580, 466, 4281, 1630, 70]",1738.0,30217930,38

Differentiated thyroid cancer theranostics: radioiodine and beyond.,The British journal of radiology,Br J Radiol,2018-10-11,"The term theranostics is the combination of a diagnostic tool that helps to define the right therapeutic tool for specific disease. It signifies the ""we know which sites require treatment (diagnostic scan) and confirm that those sites have been treated (post-therapy scan)"" demonstrating the achievable tumor dose concept. This term was first used by John Funkhouser at the beginning of the 90s, at the same time the concept of personalized medicine appeared. In nuclear medicine, theranostics is easy to apply and understand because of an easy switch from diagnosis to therapy with the same vector. It helps in maximizing tumor dose and sparing normal tissue with high specific and rapid uptake in metastasis. The oldest application of this concept is radioactive iodine I-131 (RAI). The first treatment based on the theranostic concept was performed on thyroid cancer patients with RAI in 1946. From then on management of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) has evolved on the multimodality concept. We now use the term ""our"" patient instead of ""my"" patient to signify this. However, the initial surgical management followed by RAI as per the theranostics has remained the mainstay in achieving a cure in most of DTC patients. The normal thyroid cells metabolise iodine, the principle of which is utilized in imaging of the thyroid gland with isotopes of iodine. RAI treatment of DTC is based on the principle of sodium iodide symporter (NIS) expressing thyroid cells with DTC cells having the ability of trapping circulating RAI successfully helping in treatment of residual and metastatic disease. NIS is usually negative in poorly differentiated cells and is inversely proportional to Glucose transporter receptor Type 1 expression. Both positive and negative NIS are the key components of the theranostic approach in treatment of DTC. Presence or absence of NIS is documented by either whole body iodine scintigraphy (WBS) or 2-deoxy-2(<sup>18</sup>F) fludeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET-CT).

The Transcription Factor ETV5 Mediates BRAFV600E-Induced Proliferation and TWIST1 Expression in Papillary Thyroid Cancer Cells.,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",Neoplasia,2018-09-25,"The ETS family of transcription factors is involved in several normal remodeling events and pathological processes including tumor progression. ETS transcription factors are divided into subfamilies based on the sequence and location of the ETS domain. ETV5 (Ets variant gene 5; also known as ERM) is a member of the PEA3 subfamily. Our meta-analysis of normal, benign, and malignant thyroid samples demonstrated that ETV5 expression is upregulated in papillary thyroid cancer and was predominantly associated with BRAF V600E or RAS mutations. However, the precise role of ETV5 in these lesions is unknown. In this study, we used the KTC1 cell line as a model for human advanced papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) because the cells harbor the heterozygous BRAF (V600E) mutation together with the C250T TERT promoter mutation. The role of ETV5 in PTC proliferation was tested using RNAi followed by high-throughput screening. Signaling pathways driving ETV5 expression were identified using specific pharmacological inhibitors. To determine if ETV5 influences the expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) markers in these cells, an EMT PCR array was used, and data were confirmed by qPCR and ChIP-qPCR. We found that ETV5 is critical for PTC cell growth, is expressed downstream of the MAPK pathway, and directly upregulates the transcription factor TWIST1, a known marker of intravasation and metastasis. Increased ETV5 expression could therefore be considered as a marker for advanced PTCs and a possible future therapeutic target.",Journal Article,483.0,5.0,The ETS family of transcription factors is involved in several normal remodeling events and pathological processes including tumor progression ETS transcription factors are divided into subfamilies based on the sequence and location of the ETS domain ETV5 Ets variant gene 5 also known as ERM is a member of the PEA3 subfamily Our meta-analysis of normal benign and malignant samples demonstrated that ETV5 expression is upregulated in papillary cancer and was predominantly associated with BRAF V600E or RAS mutations However the precise role of ETV5 in these lesions is unknown In this study we used the KTC1 cell line as a model for human advanced papillary cancer PTC because the cells harbor the heterozygous BRAF V600E mutation together with the C250T TERT promoter mutation The role of ETV5 in PTC proliferation was tested using RNAi followed by high-throughput screening Signaling pathways driving ETV5 expression were identified using specific pharmacological inhibitors To determine if ETV5 influences the expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal EMT markers in these cells an EMT PCR array was used and data were confirmed by qPCR and ChIP-qPCR We found that ETV5 is critical for PTC cell growth is expressed downstream of the MAPK pathway and directly upregulates the transcription factor TWIST1 a known marker of intravasation and metastasis Increased ETV5 expression could therefore be considered as a marker for advanced PTCs and a possible future therapeutic target,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[3, 4802, 607, 1, 866, 130, 16, 646, 4, 392, 295, 4429, 281, 2, 1301, 1849, 141, 30, 91, 4802, 866, 130, 32, 2176, 237, 46097, 90, 23, 3, 1532, 2, 1147, 1, 3, 4802, 1398, 20739, 4802, 1142, 145, 33, 120, 440, 22, 21535, 16, 8, 2693, 1, 3, 15098, 13989, 114, 1742, 65, 1, 295, 1002, 2, 393, 347, 264, 17, 20739, 55, 16, 2684, 4, 1796, 12, 2, 10, 2117, 41, 5, 566, 2047, 15, 1102, 138, 137, 3, 3260, 200, 1, 20739, 4, 46, 406, 16, 860, 4, 26, 45, 21, 95, 3, 41421, 31, 328, 22, 8, 202, 9, 171, 131, 1796, 12, 3748, 408, 3, 37, 2760, 3, 4167, 566, 2047, 258, 1162, 5, 3, 32636, 3846, 973, 258, 3, 200, 1, 20739, 4, 3748, 457, 10, 650, 75, 5881, 370, 20, 64, 3643, 453, 314, 460, 4057, 20739, 55, 11, 108, 75, 112, 3419, 222, 6, 223, 492, 20739, 3859, 3, 55, 1, 701, 6, 1569, 2208, 525, 4, 46, 37, 35, 2208, 604, 1926, 10, 95, 2, 74, 11, 557, 20, 6162, 2, 4222, 6162, 21, 204, 17, 20739, 16, 740, 9, 3748, 31, 129, 16, 570, 1489, 1, 3, 1748, 308, 2, 1606, 9641, 3, 866, 161, 5446, 8, 440, 952, 1, 17694, 2, 278, 101, 20739, 55, 359, 673, 40, 515, 22, 8, 952, 9, 131, 17815, 2, 8, 899, 508, 189, 283]",1480.0,30265861,162

Effect of Noninvasive Follicular Thyroid Neoplasm with Papillary-Like Nuclear Features (NIFTP) on Malignancy Rates in Thyroid Nodules: How to Counsel Patients on Extent of Surgery.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2018-10-19,"To investigate the impact of the nomenclature change to ""noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features"" (NIFTP) on reported malignancy rates following thyroidectomy. Retrospective cohort study of patients with thyroid nodules sampled preoperatively with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and subsequently removed at one tertiary-care hospital from 4/2016 to 2/2017. Surgical procedure, anatomic pathology, thyroid cytopathology classification, and demographic characteristics were recorded. Thyroidectomy was performed in 353 patients. Twenty-six patients (7.3%) had NIFTP on anatomic pathology. Preoperative FNA demonstrated atypia of undetermined significance (AUS/Bethesda III) in 13 (50%), suspicious for malignancy (SUS/Bethesda V) in 6 (23%), suspicious for follicular neoplasm (SFN/Bethesda IV) in 4 (15%), benign/Bethesda I in 2 (8%), and malignant/Bethesda VI in 1 (4%). Invasive malignancy rates across cytologic categories changed as follows: benign (n = 74) from 4 to 1%, AUS (n = 85) from 33 to 18% (p < 0.05), SFN (n = 58) from 29 to 22%, SUS (n = 33) from 91 to 73% (p < 0.05), and malignant (n = 99) from 99 to 98%. Overall decrease in invasive malignancy was 7.3% for the entire population and 13.1% for indeterminate preoperative FNA cytology (Bethesda III-V).

The positive and negative predictive values of ThyroSeq and distribution of final pathologic diagnoses were analyzed and compared with values predicted by Bayes theorem.

RET rearrangements are actionable alterations in breast cancer.,Nature communications,Nat Commun,2018-11-16,"Fusions involving the oncogenic gene RET have been observed in thyroid and lung cancers. Here we report RET gene alterations, including amplification, missense mutations, known fusions, novel fusions, and rearrangements in breast cancer. Their frequency, oncogenic potential, and actionability in breast cancer are described. Two out of eight RET fusions (NCOA4-RET and a novel RASGEF1A-RET fusion) and RET amplification were functionally characterized and shown to activate RET kinase and drive signaling through MAPK and PI3K pathways. These fusions and RET amplification can induce transformation of non-tumorigenic cells, support xenograft tumor formation, and render sensitivity to RET inhibition.

Hypothyroidism is associated with worse outcomes of hepatocellular carcinoma patients after liver transplantation.,Cancer medicine,Cancer Med,2018-11-19,"Hypothyroidism has been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence; however, the relationship between hypothyroidism and HCC patient outcomes is unclear. We investigated the impact of hypothyroidism on outcomes after liver transplantation for HCC. We retrospectively studied HCC patients transplanted between January 2000 and December 2015. Hypothyroidism was defined as a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level continuously greater than 5 mIU/L, a documented history of hypothyroidism, or treatment with thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Multivariate Cox regression was used to assess the impact of hypothyroidism on overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) adjusting for potential confounders. Subgroup analyses and interaction tests were conducted to compare the impact of hypothyroidism in different subgroups and assess for possible synergistic effects. Sensitivity analyses were performed among different cohorts to verify the stability of the results. A total of 343 HCC patients who underwent liver transplantation were included in the analysis. The primary analysis was conducted among 288 patients diagnosed with HCC prior to transplantation. Hypothyroidism was independently associated with worse OS and RFS, as was elevated TSH. The adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) of hypothyroidism was 2.45 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.44-4.18) for OS and 5.54 (2.36, 13.01) for RFS. The AHR of TSH for OS was 1.05 (1.02, 1.09) and 1.08 (1.03, 1.13) for RFS. No interaction was found among different subgroups categorized by etiology and comorbidity.

Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy augments lenvatinib's efficacy by favorably altering the immune microenvironment of murine anaplastic thyroid cancer.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2019-01-24,"Patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) have an extremely poor prognosis despite multimodal therapy with surgery and chemoradiation. Lenvatinib, a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, as well as checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed cell death pathway, have proven effective in some patients with advanced thyroid cancer. Combination of these therapies is a potential means to boost effectiveness and minimize treatment resistance in ATC. We utilized our novel immunocompetent murine model of orthotopic ATC to demonstrate that lenvatinib led to significant tumor shrinkage and increased survival, while combination therapy led to dramatic improvements in both. Lenvatinib monotherapy increased tumor-infiltrating macrophages, CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells, regulatory T-cells, and most notably, polymorphonuclear myeloid derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs). While both combination therapies led to further increases in CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells, only the lenvatinib and anti-PD-1 combination decreased PMN-MDSCs. PMN-MDSC expansion was also seen in the blood of mice and one patient receiving lenvatinib therapy for ATC. RNA-Seq of the ATC cell line used in our mouse model demonstrated that lenvatinib has multifaceted effects on angiogenesis, response to hypoxia, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and on multiple pathways implicated in inflammation and host immunity. Combination of lenvatinib with anti-Gr-1 antibody ameliorated lenvatinib's expansion of MDSCs and significantly improved lenvatinib's anti-tumor effect. These data suggest that MDSCs play a negative role in ATC's response to lenvatinib and support future study of their role as a potential biomarker and treatment target.",Journal Article,362.0,2.0,Patients with anaplastic cancer ATC have an extremely poor prognosis despite multimodal therapy with surgery and chemoradiation Lenvatinib a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor as well as checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed cell death pathway have proven effective in some patients with advanced cancer Combination of these therapies is a potential means to boost effectiveness and minimize treatment resistance in ATC We utilized our novel immunocompetent murine model of orthotopic ATC to demonstrate that lenvatinib led to significant tumor shrinkage and increased survival while combination therapy led to dramatic improvements in both Lenvatinib monotherapy increased tumor-infiltrating macrophages CD8 sup /sup T-cells regulatory T-cells and most notably polymorphonuclear myeloid derived suppressor cells PMN-MDSCs While both combination therapies led to further increases in CD8 sup /sup T-cells only the lenvatinib and anti-PD-1 combination decreased PMN-MDSCs PMN-MDSC expansion was also seen in the blood of mice and one patient receiving lenvatinib therapy for ATC RNA-Seq of the ATC cell line used in our mouse model demonstrated that lenvatinib has multifaceted effects on angiogenesis response to hypoxia the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and on multiple pathways implicated in inflammation and host immunity Combination of lenvatinib with anti-Gr-1 antibody ameliorated lenvatinib 's expansion of MDSCs and significantly improved lenvatinib 's anti-tumor effect These data suggest that MDSCs play a negative role in ATC 's response to lenvatinib and support future study of their role as a potential biomarker and treatment target,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[7, 5, 1841, 12, 3871, 47, 35, 2938, 334, 356, 550, 4122, 36, 5, 152, 2, 975, 5470, 8, 1414, 238, 564, 216, 230, 22, 149, 22, 986, 222, 529, 3, 1846, 31, 273, 308, 47, 1930, 323, 4, 476, 7, 5, 131, 12, 150, 1, 46, 235, 16, 8, 174, 2263, 6, 2569, 1236, 2, 3241, 24, 251, 4, 3871, 21, 2080, 114, 229, 6749, 1471, 202, 1, 2157, 3871, 6, 608, 17, 5470, 836, 6, 93, 30, 4973, 2, 101, 25, 369, 150, 36, 836, 6, 3079, 1474, 4, 110, 5470, 1411, 101, 30, 2097, 2748, 968, 172, 172, 102, 37, 1253, 102, 37, 2, 96, 2552, 19013, 533, 526, 1245, 37, 14009, 4410, 369, 110, 150, 235, 836, 6, 195, 1106, 4, 968, 172, 172, 102, 37, 158, 3, 5470, 2, 312, 333, 14, 150, 340, 14009, 4410, 14009, 4428, 1422, 10, 120, 527, 4, 3, 315, 1, 399, 2, 104, 69, 357, 5470, 36, 9, 3871, 893, 4185, 1, 3, 3871, 31, 328, 95, 4, 114, 830, 202, 264, 17, 5470, 71, 10076, 176, 23, 1056, 51, 6, 1823, 3, 701, 6, 1569, 1970, 2, 23, 232, 460, 1771, 4, 1815, 2, 1204, 1604, 150, 1, 5470, 5, 312, 3845, 14, 548, 13841, 5470, 292, 1422, 1, 4410, 2, 97, 231, 5470, 292, 312, 30, 254, 46, 74, 309, 17, 4410, 1343, 8, 199, 200, 4, 3871, 292, 51, 6, 5470, 2, 538, 508, 45, 1, 136, 200, 22, 8, 174, 901, 2, 24, 283]",1669.0,30515783,186

Risk of solid subsequent malignant neoplasms after childhood Hodgkin lymphoma-Identification of high-risk populations to guide surveillance: A report from the Late Effects Study Group.,Cancer,Cancer,2018-12-17,"Survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in childhood have an increased risk of subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs). Herein, the authors extended the follow-up of a previously reported Late Effects Study Group cohort and identified patients at highest risk for SMNs to create evidence for risk-based screening recommendations. The standardized incidence ratio was calculated using rates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program as a reference. The risk of SMN was estimated using proportional subdistribution hazards regression. The cohort included 1136 patients who were diagnosed with HL before age 17 years between 1955 and 1986. The median length of follow-up was 26.6 years. In 162 patients, a total of 196 solid SMNs (sSMNs) were identified. Compared with the general population, the cohort was found to be at a 14-fold increased risk of developing an sSMN (95% confidence interval, 12.0-fold to 16.3-fold). The cumulative incidence of any sSMN was 26.4% at 40 years after a diagnosis of HL. Risk factors for breast cancer among females were an HL diagnosis between ages 10 years and 16 years and receipt of chest radiotherapy. Males treated with chest radiotherapy at age <10 years were found to be at highest risk of developing lung cancer. Survivors of HL who were treated with abdominal/pelvic radiotherapy and high-dose alkylating agents were found to be at highest risk of developing colorectal cancer and females exposed to neck radiotherapy at age <10 years were at highest risk of thyroid cancer.

Assessment of Between-Hospital Variation in Readmission and Mortality After Cancer Surgical Procedures.,JAMA network open,JAMA Netw Open,2018-10-05,"Although current federal quality improvement programs do not include cancer surgery, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and other payers are considering extending readmission reduction initiatives to include these and other common high-cost episodes. To quantify between-hospital variation in quality-related outcomes and identify hospital characteristics associated with high and low performance. This retrospective cohort study obtained data through linkage of the California Cancer Registry to hospital discharge claims databases maintained by the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. All 351 acute care hospitals in California at which 1 or more adults underwent curative intent surgery between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2011, with analyses finalized July 15, 2018, were included. A total of 138 799 adults undergoing surgery for colorectal, breast, lung, prostate, bladder, thyroid, kidney, endometrial, pancreatic, liver, or esophageal cancer within 6 months of diagnosis, with an American Joint Committee on Cancer stage of I to III at diagnosis, were included. Measures included adjusted odds ratios and variance components from hierarchical mixed-effects logistic regression analyses of in-hospital mortality, 90-day readmission, and 90-day mortality, as well as hospital-specific risk-adjusted rates and risk-adjusted standardized rate ratios for hospitals with a mean annual surgical volume of 10 or more. Across 138 799 patients at the 351 included hospitals, 8.9% were aged 18 to 44 years and 45.9% were aged 65 years or older, 57.4% were women, and 18.2% were nonwhite. Among these, 1240 patients (0.9%) died during the index admission. Among 137 559 patients discharged alive, 19 670 (14.3%) were readmitted and 1754 (1.3%) died within 90 days. After adjusting for patient case-mix differences, evidence of statistically significant variation in risk across hospitals was identified, as characterized by the variance of the random effects in the mixed model, for all 3 metrics (P < .001). In addition, substantial variation was observed in hospital performance profiles: across 260 hospitals with a mean annual surgical volume of 10 or more, 59 (22.7%) had lower-than-expected rates for all 3 metrics, 105 (40.4%) had higher-than-expected rates for 2 of the 3, and 19 (7.3%) had higher-than-expected rates for all 3 metrics. Accounting for patient case-mix differences, there appears to be substantial between-hospital variation in in-hospital mortality, 90-day readmission, and 90-day mortality after cancer surgical procedures. Recognizing the multifaceted nature of hospital performance through consideration of mortality and readmission simultaneously may help to prioritize strategies for improving surgical outcomes.",Journal Article,473.0,5.0,Although current federal quality improvement programs do not include cancer surgery the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services and other payers are considering extending readmission reduction initiatives to include these and other common high-cost episodes To quantify between-hospital variation in quality-related outcomes and identify hospital characteristics associated with high and low performance This retrospective cohort study obtained data through linkage of the California Cancer Registry to hospital discharge claims databases maintained by the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development All 351 acute care hospitals in California at which 1 or more adults underwent curative intent surgery between January 1 2007 and December 31 2011 with analyses finalized July 15 2018 were included A total of 138 799 adults undergoing surgery for or cancer within 6 months of diagnosis with an American Joint Committee on Cancer stage of I to III at diagnosis were included Measures included adjusted odds ratios and variance components from hierarchical mixed-effects logistic regression analyses of in-hospital mortality 90-day readmission and 90-day mortality as well as hospital-specific risk-adjusted rates and risk-adjusted standardized rate ratios for hospitals with a mean annual surgical volume of 10 or more Across 138 799 patients at the 351 included hospitals 8.9 were aged 18 to 44 years and 45.9 were aged 65 years or older 57.4 were women and 18.2 were nonwhite Among these 1240 patients 0.9 died during the index admission Among 137 559 patients discharged alive 19 670 14.3 were readmitted and 1754 1.3 died within 90 days After adjusting for patient case-mix differences evidence of statistically significant variation in risk across hospitals was identified as characterized by the variance of the random effects in the mixed model for all 3 metrics P .001 In addition substantial variation was observed in hospital performance profiles across 260 hospitals with a mean annual surgical volume of 10 or more 59 22.7 had lower-than-expected rates for all 3 metrics 105 40.4 had higher-than-expected rates for 2 of the 3 and 19 7.3 had higher-than-expected rates for all 3 metrics Accounting for patient case-mix differences there appears to be substantial between-hospital variation in in-hospital mortality 90-day readmission and 90-day mortality after cancer surgical procedures Recognizing the multifaceted nature of hospital performance through consideration of mortality and readmission simultaneously may help to prioritize strategies for improving surgical outcomes,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,"[242, 291, 8536, 372, 767, 2251, 1022, 44, 643, 12, 152, 3, 1168, 9, 1378, 2843, 2142, 2, 127, 9361, 32, 3075, 4782, 3146, 628, 6328, 6, 643, 46, 2, 127, 186, 64, 835, 3750, 6, 3091, 59, 702, 1380, 4, 372, 139, 123, 2, 255, 702, 374, 41, 5, 64, 2, 154, 528, 26, 459, 180, 45, 683, 74, 298, 4820, 1, 3, 4355, 12, 1608, 6, 702, 2993, 2770, 2348, 1955, 20, 3, 4355, 6489, 1, 13749, 341, 1349, 2, 193, 62, 7270, 286, 165, 1987, 4, 4355, 28, 92, 14, 15, 80, 857, 208, 1075, 1697, 152, 59, 1024, 14, 1307, 2, 1397, 456, 1132, 5, 318, 28783, 2066, 167, 2982, 11, 159, 8, 181, 1, 4478, 13096, 857, 479, 152, 9, 15, 12, 262, 49, 53, 1, 147, 5, 35, 597, 2093, 2002, 23, 12, 82, 1, 70, 6, 316, 28, 147, 11, 159, 1018, 159, 586, 610, 1137, 2, 4446, 1628, 29, 4466, 1739, 176, 812, 320, 318, 1, 4, 702, 282, 424, 218, 3146, 2, 424, 218, 282, 22, 149, 22, 702, 112, 43, 586, 151, 2, 43, 586, 1670, 116, 1137, 9, 1987, 5, 8, 313, 2114, 221, 433, 1, 79, 15, 80, 716, 4478, 13096, 7, 28, 3, 7270, 159, 1987, 66, 83, 11, 1032, 203, 6, 584, 60, 2, 512, 83, 11, 1032, 556, 60, 15, 434, 696, 39, 11, 117, 2, 203, 18, 11, 8335, 107, 46, 41122, 7, 13, 83, 1016, 190, 3, 558, 3411, 107, 4352, 15710, 7, 6155, 1701, 326, 10335, 213, 27, 11, 8351, 2, 38682, 14, 27, 1016, 262, 424, 162, 50, 1358, 9, 69, 473, 8842, 362, 241, 1, 712, 93, 1380, 4, 43, 716, 1987, 10, 108, 22, 765, 20, 3, 4446, 1, 3, 2324, 176, 4, 3, 1739, 202, 9, 62, 27, 3589, 19, 144, 4, 352, 1281, 1380, 10, 164, 4, 702, 528, 1241, 716, 6398, 1987, 5, 8, 313, 2114, 221, 433, 1, 79, 15, 80, 728, 350, 67, 42, 280, 76, 1336, 151, 9, 62, 27, 3589, 3263, 327, 39, 42, 142, 76, 1336, 151, 9, 18, 1, 3, 27, 2, 326, 67, 27, 42, 142, 76, 1336, 151, 9, 62, 27, 3589, 3116, 9, 69, 473, 8842, 362, 125, 1233, 6, 40, 1281, 59, 702, 1380, 4, 4, 702, 282, 424, 218, 3146, 2, 424, 218, 282, 50, 12, 221, 1369, 5842, 3, 10076, 2202, 1, 702, 528, 298, 2415, 1, 282, 2, 3146, 3074, 68, 987, 6, 7716, 422, 9, 1673, 221, 123]",2608.0,30646221,119
Interaction of germline variants in a family with a history of early-onset clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,Molecular genetics & genomic medicine,Mol Genet Genomic Med,2019-01-24,"Identification of genetic factors causing predisposition to renal cell carcinoma has helped improve screening, early detection, and patient survival. We report the characterization of a proband with renal and thyroid cancers and a family history of renal and other cancers by whole-exome sequencing (WES), coupled with WES analysis of germline DNA from additional affected and unaffected family members. This work identified multiple predicted protein-damaging variants relevant to the pattern of inherited cancer risk. Among these, the proband and an affected brother each had a heterozygous Ala45Thr variant in SDHA, a component of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex. SDH defects are associated with mitochondrial disorders and risk for various cancers; immunochemical analysis indicated loss of SDHB protein expression in the patient's tumor, compatible with SDH deficiency. Integrated analysis of public databases and structural predictions indicated that the two affected individuals also had additional variants in genes including TGFB2, TRAP1, PARP1, and EGF, each potentially relevant to cancer risk alone or in conjunction with the SDHA variant. In addition, allelic imbalances of PARP1 and TGFB2 were detected in the tumor of the proband.

Managing the adverse events associated with lenvatinib therapy in radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer.,Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2018-12-21,"Lenvatinib is a multikinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors 1-3, fibroblast growth factor receptors 1-4, RET, KIT, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α. Lenvatinib is approved as a monotherapy for the treatment of radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer and in combination with everolimus for the second-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. Lenvatinib is also under investigation for the treatment of several malignancies including unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Although lenvatinib is associated with favorable efficacy, it is associated with adverse events (AEs) that the clinician will have to closely monitor for and proactively manage. Most of these AEs are known class effects of VEGF-targeted therapies, including hypertension, diarrhea, fatigue or asthenia, decreased appetite, and weight loss.

Secondary objectives included study of coexisting mutations and factors impacting survival of ALK+ NSCLC. All patients with metastatic ALK+ NSCLC at the City of Hope Cancer Center in Duarte, California from 2010 to 2017 were selected for retrospective chart review. The demographic variables were collected. The molecular statuses of patients were evaluated through commercially available platforms for next-generation sequencing. Three-dimensional volumetric images were generated for the primary lesion and different sites of metastasis. Sixty two patients with ALK+ NSCLC were identified from 2010 to 2017. The median age was 59 with 36 (58%) female individuals and only 20 (32%) smokers. Twenty four patients had uncommon sites of metastasis which were thyroid, soft tissue, chest and abdominal wall, spleen, peritoneum, omentum, kidney, and ovary. Common characteristics of the primary lesions were right upper lobe location (N=23 [37%]), oval shape (N=22 [35%]), irregular margins (N=26 [42%]), solid lesions (N=27 [44%]), presence of pleural contact or effusion (N=22 [35%]). Twenty four patients had next-generation sequencing testing which showed coexisting mutations such as TP53 (N=8), EGFR (N=5), KRAS (N=3).

Hyperthyroidism After Radiation Therapy for Childhood Cancer: A Report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2019-02-12,"The association of hyperthyroidism with exposure to ionizing radiation is poorly understood. This study addresses the risk of hyperthyroidism in relation to incidental therapeutic radiation dose to the thyroid and pituitary glands in a large cohort of survivors of childhood cancer. Using the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study's cohort of 5-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed at hospitals in the United States and Canada between 1970 and 1986, the occurrence of hyperthyroidism through 2009 was ascertained among 12,183 survivors who responded to serial questionnaires. Radiation doses to the thyroid and pituitary glands were estimated from radiation therapy records, and chemotherapy exposures were abstracted from medical records. Binary outcome regression was used to estimate prevalence odds ratios (ORs) for hyperthyroidism at 5 years from diagnosis of childhood cancer and Poisson regression to estimate incidence rate ratios (RRs) after the first 5 years. Survivors reported 179 cases of hyperthyroidism, of which 148 were diagnosed 5 or more years after their cancer diagnosis. The cumulative proportion of survivors diagnosed with hyperthyroidism by 30 years after the cancer diagnosis was 2.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0%-2.9%) among those who received radiation therapy. A linear relation adequately described the thyroid radiation dose response for prevalence of self-reported hyperthyroidism 5 years after cancer diagnosis (excess OR/Gy, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.06-0.95) and incidence rate thereafter (excess RR/Gy, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.03-0.14) over the dose range of 0 to 63 Gy. Neither radiation dose to the pituitary gland nor chemotherapy was associated significantly with hyperthyroidism. Radiation-associated risk remained elevated >25 years after exposure. Risk of hyperthyroidism after radiation therapy during childhood is positively associated with external radiation dose to the thyroid gland, with radiation-related excess risk persisting for >25 years.

Patient preferences on the use of technology in cancer surveillance after curative surgery: A cross-sectional analysis.,Surgery,Surgery,2019-02-13,"Advances in communication technology have enabled new methods of delivering test results to cancer survivors. We sought to determine patient preferences regarding the use of newer technology in delivering test results during cancer surveillance. A single institutional, cross-sectional analysis of the preferences of adult cancer survivors regarding the means (secure digital communication versus phone call or office visit) to receive surveillance test results was undertaken. Among 257 respondents, the average age was 59.1 years (SD 13.5) and 61.8% were female. Common malignancies included melanoma/sarcoma (29.5%), thyroid (25.7%), breast (22.8%), and gastrointestinal (22.0%) cancer. Although patients expressed a relative preference to receive normal surveillance results via MyChart or secure e-mail, the majority preferred abnormal imaging (87.2%) or blood results (85.9%) to be communicated by in-office appointments or phone calls irrespective of age or cancer type.

"Safety and antitumor activity of the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab in patients with advanced, PD-L1-positive papillary or follicular thyroid cancer.",BMC cancer,BMC Cancer,2019-03-04,"Treatment options for advanced thyroid cancer refractory to standard therapies are limited. The safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab were evaluated in patients with advanced differentiated thyroid cancer expressing programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Patients with advanced thyroid cancer were enrolled in the nonrandomized, phase Ib KEYNOTE-028 trial conducted to evaluate safety and antitumor activity of the anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) antibody pembrolizumab in advanced solid tumors. Key eligibility criteria were advanced papillary or follicular thyroid cancer, failure of standard therapy, and PD-L1 expression in tumor or stroma cells (assessed by immunohistochemistry). Pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg was administered every 2 weeks up to 24 months or until confirmed progression or intolerable toxicity. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. Twenty-two patients were enrolled: median age was 61 years; 59% were women; and 68% had papillary carcinoma. Median follow-up was 31 months (range, 7-34 months). Treatment-related adverse events were observed in 18 (82%) patients; those occurring in ≥15% of patients were diarrhea (n = 7) and fatigue (n = 4). One grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse event occurred (colitis, grade 3); no treatment-related discontinuations or deaths occurred. Two patients had confirmed partial response, for an ORR of 9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1-29%); response duration was 8 and 20 months. Median progression-free survival was 7 months (95% CI, 2-14 months); median overall survival was not reached (95% CI, 22 months to not reached). Results of this phase Ib proof-of-concept study suggest that pembrolizumab has a manageable safety profile and demonstrate evidence of antitumor activity in advanced differentiated thyroid cancer in a minority of patients treated. Further analyses are necessary to confirm these findings. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02054806 .

Most cancers start due to changes at gene level that happen over a person's lifetime when DNA repair system becomes faulty. CCDC6, one of the players in DNA repair system acts as a tumor suppressor gene. It was originally identified in chimeric genes caused by chromosomal translocation involving RET proto-oncogene in some thyroid tumors. Different fusion chimers with different proto-oncogenes like RET are known for CCDC6 which hampered its function. Further, CCDC6 is recognized as a pro-apoptotic phosphoprotein, which is an ATM substrate responsive to genotoxic stress. In this article, we reviewed the published literature to characterize CCDC6 fusions with proto-oncogenes and the role of natural phytochemicals which can potentially alter CCDC6 activity and thus can prove beneficial for cancer patients.",Journal Article,385.0,1.0,Cancer a deadly disease is characterized by abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade to other parts of the body Most cancers start due to changes at gene level that happen over a person 's lifetime when DNA repair system becomes faulty CCDC6 one of the players in DNA repair system acts as a tumor suppressor gene It was originally identified in chimeric genes caused by chromosomal translocation involving RET proto-oncogene in some tumors Different fusion chimers with different proto-oncogenes like RET are known for CCDC6 which hampered its function Further CCDC6 is recognized as a pro-apoptotic phosphoprotein which is an ATM substrate responsive to genotoxic stress In this article we reviewed the published literature to characterize CCDC6 fusions with proto-oncogenes and the role of natural phytochemicals which can potentially alter CCDC6 activity and thus can prove beneficial for cancer patients,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[12, 8, 6610, 34, 16, 765, 20, 1668, 31, 129, 5, 3, 174, 6, 9844, 6, 127, 6532, 1, 3, 642, 96, 163, 2435, 520, 6, 400, 28, 145, 301, 17, 19834, 252, 8, 2719, 292, 2898, 198, 261, 972, 398, 5366, 51478, 17048, 104, 1, 3, 10996, 4, 261, 972, 398, 4459, 22, 8, 30, 1245, 145, 192, 10, 5045, 108, 4, 2897, 214, 1546, 20, 1860, 2006, 1267, 2412, 4976, 1836, 4, 476, 57, 338, 1212, 74602, 5, 338, 4976, 3326, 733, 2412, 32, 440, 9, 17048, 92, 6786, 211, 343, 195, 17048, 16, 1904, 22, 8, 1805, 1631, 12302, 92, 16, 35, 3552, 4235, 2443, 6, 7876, 1531, 4, 26, 946, 21, 446, 3, 983, 789, 6, 1507, 17048, 2530, 5, 4976, 3326, 2, 3, 200, 1, 1504, 11417, 92, 122, 751, 2688, 17048, 128, 2, 631, 122, 4361, 2524, 9, 12, 7]",917.0,30909182,278
Vitamin D deficiency and its relationship to cancer stage in patients who underwent thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid carcinoma.,American journal of otolaryngology,Am J Otolaryngol,2019-04-22,"As imaging technology improves and more thyroid nodules and malignancies are identified, it is important to recognize factors associated with malignancy and poor prognosis. Vitamin D has proven useful as a prognostic tool for other cancers and may be similarly useful in thyroid cancer. This study explores the relationship of Vitamin D to papillary thyroid carcinoma stage while accounting for socioeconomic covariates. The medical records of all patients who underwent thyroidectomy at one institution between 2000 and 2015 were reviewed. Subjects with non-papillary thyroid cancer pathology, prior malignancy, and without Vitamin D levels were excluded. The remaining 334 patient records were examined for cancer stage, Vitamin D levels, Vitamin D deficiency listed in history, and demographic and comorbid factors. Vitamin D laboratory values showed no significant relationship to cancer stage (p = 0.871), but patients with Vitamin D deficiency documented in the medical record were more likely to have advanced disease (28.6% versus 14.7%; p = 0.028). The patients with documented Vitamin D deficiency also had lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D nadirs (21.5 ng/mL versus 26.5 ng/mL, p = 0.008) and were more likely to be on Vitamin D supplementation (92.6% versus 41.8%, p < 0.001). The results suggest that Vitamin D deficiency may have value as a negative prognostic indicator in papillary thyroid cancer and that pre-operative laboratory evaluation may be less useful. This is important because Vitamin D deficiency is modifiable.

Thyroid Cancer Brain Metastasis: Survival and Genomic Characteristics of a Large Tertiary Care Cohort.,Clinical nuclear medicine,Clin Nucl Med,2019-07-01,"Brain metastases (BMs) in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) are rare but associated with poor prognosis. We examined risk factors for overall survival (OS) in this population and explored the pattern of genomic alterations. Single-institution, retrospective review of all patients with DTC from January 2000 to November 2016 identified 79 patients for analysis. Multiple prognostic factors, including age, gender, distal metastasis (DM), diagnosis time, DM sites, BM diagnosis time, BM number and size, genomic sequencing data, craniectomy, external beam radiation therapy, and kinase inhibitor therapies, were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Median survival after BM was 18 months. One- and 3-year survival rates were 63% and 33%, respectively. Univariate analysis identified 4 covariates correlated with prolonged survival: time between DTC diagnosis and BM for less than 3 years (P = 0.01), time from initial DM diagnosis to BM for 22 months or less (P = 0.03), 3 BM sites or fewer (P = 0.002), and craniectomy (P = 0.05). Multivariate model revealed 3 variables associated with OS: DTC diagnosis to BM time of less than 3 years (P = 0.04), craniectomy (P = 0.06), and patients with fewer than 3 BM sites (P = 0.06).

We performed a pilot survey study examining Toronto-area family physician (FP) perspectives on thyroid neoplasm evaluation (i.e. thyroid nodules [TNs] or thyroid cancer [TC]) in this region, to explore for potential factors leading to overdiagnosis. We performed a cross-sectional mail-out written survey of a random sample of 300 FPs in active practice in the Greater Toronto Area (Markham and Brampton). The overall response rate was 22.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 18.0, 27.4% (67/300); the effective response rate was 19.9, 95% CI 15.7, 24.9% (58/291), after excluding 6 FPs that reported TN evaluation was outside their scope of practice and three FPs with an invalid mailing address. There were no missing responses to questions. The demographic characteristics were as follows: 58.6% (34/58) from Markham, 55.2% (32/58) were female, 58.6% (34/58) were in practice > 10 years, and 32.8% (19/58) affiliated with a University. All FPs reported easy access to thyroid ultrasound (TUS). About half of FPs were concerned about overdiagnosis of TC and most did not believe that there was any TC survival advantage with routine screening TUS. Although appropriate indications for TUS were endorsed by most respondents (e.g. palpable TN, incidental TN on other imaging), inappropriate recommendations were observed in a third of FPs (19/57) who recommended TUS for abnormal thyroid blood tests about half of FPs (30/56) who endorsed biopsy of sub-centimeter nodules.

Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Treatment with external beam radiation was found to significantly increase survival (P = 0.03). The 5-year survival rate was 59% and median survival was 92 months. Patients who developed bone metastasis earlier tend to live longer (P = 0.06). The presence of TERT and BRAF mutations did not significantly worsen the prognosis (P = 0.10). Patients with DTC can benefit from early treatment with external beam radiation therapy, especially those who develop bone metastasis within 3 years of primary TC diagnosis.

Revisiting metastatic central nervous system tumors with unknown primary using clinicopathological findings: A single neurosciences institutional study.,Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,,"Metastatic tumors are the most common central nervous system (CNS) tumors wherein the primary site remains unknown in most of the cases. Aim: The study was carried out to evaluate metastatic CNS tumors with unknown primary by using simplified diagnostic (clinico-histopathologic) approach. A 2 years study was conducted on 32 cases of CNS metastases having unknown primary tumors in a neurosciences institute. All the results were prepared using software version of SPSS 22. The most common metastatic site found in brain was cerebrum (59.3%) [frontal > frontoparietal > parieto-occipital > temporal] [left cerebrum > right cerebrum], followed by cerebellum (12.5%), spinal cord (9.3%), and leptomeninges (3.12%). Most of the metastatic tumors presented as ill-defined (34%) rather than well-defined (22%) lesions with ring enhancement seen only in 16% of the cases on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).On histopathology findings with targeted immunohistochemistry, most common histological tumor type identified irrespective of site was adenocarcinoma (68.7%), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (15.6%) and poorly differentiated carcinoma (12.5%). Only one case of lymphoma was reported. Corroborating all the above findings along with clinical history and other relevant investigations, primary sites could be detected in 23 cases (71.8%).The most common primary site deduced was lungs (39.1%), followed by thyroid (17.3%), breast in females (13.0%), gastrointestinal tract (8.6%), and prostate in males (4.3%).

RET fusions in solid tumors.,Cancer treatment reviews,Cancer Treat. Rev.,2019-10-30,"The RET proto-oncogene has been well-studied. RET is involved in many different physiological and developmental functions. When altered, RET mutations influence disease in a variety of organ systems from Hirschsprung's disease and multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 (MEN2) to papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Changes in RET expression have been discovered in 30-70% of invasive breast cancers and 50-60% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas in addition to colorectal adenocarcinoma, melanoma, small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, and small intestine neuroendocrine tumors. RET mutations have been associated with tumor proliferation, invasion, and migration. RET fusions or rearrangements are somatic juxtapositions of 5' sequences from other genes with 3' RET sequences encoding tyrosine kinase. RET rearrangements occur in approximately 2.5-73% of sporadic PTC and 1-3% of NSCLC patients. The most common RET fusions are CDCC6-RET and NCOA4-RET in PTC and KIF5B-RET in NSCLC. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are drugs that target kinases such as RET in RET-driven (RET-mutation or RET-fusion-positive) disease. Multikinase inhibitors (MKI) target various kinases and other receptors. Several MKIs are FDA-approved for cancer therapy (sunitinib, sorafenib, vandetanib, cabozantinib, regorafenib, ponatinib, lenvatinib, alectinib) and non-oncologic disease (nintedanib). Selective RET inhibitor drugs LOXO-292 (selpercatinib) and BLU-667 (pralsetinib) are also undergoing phase I/II and I clinical trials, respectively, with preliminary results demonstrating partial response and low incidence of serious adverse events.

Germline inactivation of PTEN and dysregulation of the phosphoinositol-3-kinase/Akt pathway cause human Lhermitte-Duclos disease in adults.,American journal of human genetics,Am. J. Hum. Genet.,2003-10-17,"Lhermitte-Duclos disease (LDD), or dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum, is an unusual hamartomatous overgrowth disorder. LDD can be familial or, more commonly, sporadic. It has been only recently recognized that LDD may be associated with Cowden syndrome (CS). Over 80% of patients with CS carry germline mutations in PTEN. It remains unclear whether all cases of LDD, even without features of CS, are caused by germline PTEN mutation and whether somatic PTEN mutation occurs in sporadic LDD. We obtained paraffin-embedded LDD lesions from 18 unselected, unrelated patients and performed mutational analysis of PTEN. Overall, 15 (83%) of 18 samples were found to carry a PTEN mutation. All individuals with mutations were adult-onset patients, but the three without mutations were diagnosed at the ages of 1, 3, and 11 years. Germline DNA was available from six adult-onset cases, and all had germline PTEN mutations. Of these six, two had CS features, one did not have CS features, and three were of unknown CS status. Immunohistochemistry revealed that 75% of the LDD samples had complete or partial loss of PTEN expression accompanied by elevated phosphorylated Akt, specifically in the dysplastic gangliocytoma cells.

Papillary phenotype confers improved survival after resection of hilar cholangiocarcinoma.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2005-05-01,"The current study compares outcome after resection of papillary hilar cholangiocarcinoma to that of the more common nodular-sclerosing subtype. Clinical, radiologic, histopathologic, and survival data on all patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma were analyzed. Resected tumors were reexamined and classified as nodular-sclerosing (no component of papillary carcinoma) or papillary (any component of papillary carcinoma); for papillary tumors, the proportion of invasive carcinoma present was determined. Differences in the clinical behavior and histopathologic features of nodular-sclerosing and papillary tumors were assessed. From January 1991 to November 2003, 279 patients were evaluated, 154 men (55.2%) and 125 women (44.8%), with a mean age of 65.4 +/- 0.7 years (median = 68, range 23-87 years). Of the 215 patients explored, 106 (49.5%) underwent a complete gross resection. An en bloc partial hepatectomy (n = 87) and an R0 resection (n = 82) were independent predictors of favorable outcome. Operative mortality was 7.5% but was 2.8% over the last 4 years of the study, and there were no operative deaths in the last 33 consecutive resections. Twenty-five resected tumors (23.6%) contained a papillary component: 12 were minimally or noninvasive (<10% invasive cancer) and 13 had an invasive component ranging from 10% to 95% (> or =10%). Patients with papillary and nodular-sclerosing tumors had similar demographics, operative procedures, and proportion of R0 resections. By contrast, papillary tumors were significantly larger, more often well-differentiated, and earlier stage. Disease-specific survival after resection of papillary tumors (55.7 months) was greater than after resection of nodular-sclerosing lesions (33.5 months, P = 0.013). The papillary phenotype was an independent predictor of survival, although the benefit was more pronounced for less invasive tumors.

Different splicing defects lead to differential effects downstream of the lipid and protein phosphatase activities of PTEN.,Human molecular genetics,Hum. Mol. Genet.,2005-07-13,"PTEN, encoding a dual phosphatase tumor suppressor, is mutated in 85 and 65% of individuals with Cowden syndrome (CS) and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), respectively. Approximately 23 germline mutations in putative splice sites have been published, but resulting downstream outcome data are limited. We determined splicing defects in PTEN in 40 germline PTEN mutation positive cases and 33 mutation negative cases with classic CS, BRRS and CS- or BRRS-like features. Altered splicing was observed in 4/40 mutation positive probands and 2/33 mutation negative probands. We then sought to characterize the transcriptional and biochemical outcomes of the five distinct splice-site mutations, which led to the skipping of exon 3, 4 or 6. Two mutation negative BRRS patients also showed exon 3 skipping, and later, genomic sequencing revealed a mutation deep in intron 2. The splice-site mutations leading to the deletions of exon 3, 4 or 6 resulted in reduced dual phosphatase activities of PTEN. Deletion of exon 4 was associated with severely reduced lipid phosphatase activity, whereas exon 3 skipping resulted in markedly reduced protein phosphatase activity. In addition, exon 3 deleted transcript and protein were stable and localized to the nucleus more efficiently than the wild-type PTEN. In contrast, exon 4 skipping resulted in unstable transcripts and severely truncated unstable PTEN protein lacking its phosphatase domain.

PTEN autoregulates its expression by stabilization of p53 in a phosphatase-independent manner.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2006-01-01,"PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue, deleted on chromosome 10) is a tumor suppressor with dual phosphatase activity and mutations of its gene, PTEN, have been associated with many sporadic cancers and heritable neoplasia syndromes, including Cowden syndrome and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome. However, accumulating evidence now shows that PTEN may have novel functions other than as a phosphatase. In the present study, we show that PTEN is able to autoregulate its expression through the stabilization of another tumor suppressor p53. We further show that PTEN enhances p53 transactivation, a relationship that requires the interaction between PTEN and p53 and is PTEN phosphatase independent. We show that cell lines from Cowden syndrome and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome patients with germ line PTEN promoter mutations in the vicinity of the p53-binding motifs have altered p53 regulation. This seems to be due to reduced PTEN stability and decreased PTEN-p53 interactions.

Distinct expression profiles for PTEN transcript and its splice variants in Cowden syndrome and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome.,American journal of human genetics,Am. J. Hum. Genet.,2006-05-22,"Cowden syndrome (CS) and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS) are autosomal dominant hamartoma syndromes. Germline PTEN mutations have been associated with 85% of CS cases and 65% of BRRS cases and also with other disorders, which are collectively referred to as the ""PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome."" The human PTEN gene has been previously found to express two naturally occurring splice variants (SVs). Recently, we identified eight novel naturally occurring PTEN SVs that result in different downstream signaling effects: SV3a, SV3b, SV3c (inclusion of various lengths of intron 3 3' of exon 3), SV5a, SV5b, SV5c, SV5d (inclusion of various lengths of intron 5 3' of exon 5), and SV Delta Ex6 (deletion of exon 6). We therefore sought to characterize the relative expression of 5', middle, and 3' full-length PTEN mRNA (FL-PTEN) and also of these eight PTEN SVs in 85 (65 female and 20 male) patients with CS/BRRS (with or without PTEN mutations) compared with 27 controls, using a SYBR green quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Significantly reduced FL-PTEN levels were found in the probands, compared with those of controls (P < .01). Apart from FL-PTEN, SV3a is the most consistently relatively underexpressed in patients compared with controls. The patients showed relative underexpression of SV3a and SV3b and overexpression of SV5b (P = .005, P = .02, and P = .04, respectively). Indeed, there appears to be an SV expressional genotype-phenotype correlation in which the SV expressional profiles are distinct among CS, CS-like, and BRRS.

Mutation-positive and mutation-negative patients with Cowden and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndromes associated with distinct 10q haplotypes.,American journal of human genetics,Am. J. Hum. Genet.,2006-09-29,"Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) encodes a tumor-suppressor phosphatase frequently mutated in both sporadic and heritable forms of human cancer. Germline mutations are associated with a number of heritable cancer syndromes that are jointly referred to as the ""PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome"" (PHTS) and include Cowden syndrome, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, Proteus syndrome, and Proteus-like syndrome. Germline PTEN mutations have been identified in a significant proportion of patients with PHTS; however, there are still many individuals with classic diagnostic features for whom mutations have yet to be identified. To address this, we took a haplotype-based approach and investigated the association of specific genomic regions of the PTEN locus with PHTS. We found this locus to be characterized by three distinct haplotype blocks 33 kb, 65 kb, and 43 kb in length. Comparisons of the haplotype distributions for all three blocks differed significantly among patients with PHTS and controls (P=.0098, P<.0001, and P<.0001 for blocks 1, 2, and 3, respectively). ""Rare"" haplotype blocks and extended haplotypes account for two-to-threefold more PHTS chromosomes than control chromosomes. PTEN mutation-negative patients are strongly associated with a haplotype block spanning a region upstream of PTEN and the gene's first intron (P=.0027). Furthermore, allelic combinations contribute to the phenotypic complexity of this syndrome. Taken together, these data suggest that specific haplotypes and rare alleles underlie the disease etiology in these sample populations; constitute low-penetrance, modifying loci; and, specifically in the case of patients with PHTS for whom traditional mutations have yet to be identified, may harbor pathogenic variant(s) that have escaped detection by standard PTEN mutation-scanning methodologies.",Journal Article,4862.0,22.0,Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 PTEN encodes a tumor-suppressor phosphatase frequently mutated in both sporadic and heritable forms of human cancer Germline mutations are associated with a number of heritable cancer syndromes that are jointly referred to as the `` PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome '' PHTS and include Cowden syndrome Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome Proteus syndrome and Proteus-like syndrome Germline PTEN mutations have been identified in a significant proportion of patients with PHTS however there are still many individuals with classic diagnostic features for whom mutations have yet to be identified To address this we took a haplotype-based approach and investigated the association of specific genomic regions of the PTEN locus with PHTS We found this locus to be characterized by three distinct haplotype blocks 33 kb 65 kb and 43 kb in length Comparisons of the haplotype distributions for all three blocks differed significantly among patients with PHTS and controls P=.0098 P .0001 and P .0001 for blocks 1 2 and 3 respectively `` Rare '' haplotype blocks and extended haplotypes account for two-to-threefold more PHTS chromosomes than control chromosomes PTEN mutation-negative patients are strongly associated with a haplotype block spanning a region upstream of PTEN and the gene 's first intron P=.0027 Furthermore allelic combinations contribute to the phenotypic complexity of this syndrome Taken together these data suggest that specific haplotypes and rare alleles underlie the disease etiology in these sample populations constitute low-penetrance modifying loci and specifically in the case of patients with PHTS for whom traditional mutations have yet to be identified may harbor pathogenic variant s that have escaped detection by standard PTEN mutation-scanning methodologies,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[2577, 2, 6111, 3412, 4389, 23, 1170, 79, 820, 4322, 8, 30, 1245, 2577, 746, 1185, 4, 110, 1928, 2, 6874, 2377, 1, 171, 12, 1009, 138, 32, 41, 5, 8, 207, 1, 6874, 12, 2040, 17, 32, 7609, 1995, 6, 22, 3, 820, 8025, 30, 681, 522, 7390, 2, 643, 5561, 681, 12484, 12485, 12486, 681, 14078, 681, 2, 14078, 733, 681, 1009, 820, 138, 47, 85, 108, 4, 8, 93, 920, 1, 7, 5, 7390, 137, 125, 32, 1234, 445, 869, 5, 3168, 752, 404, 9, 953, 138, 47, 1145, 6, 40, 108, 6, 1539, 26, 21, 5060, 8, 4179, 90, 353, 2, 565, 3, 248, 1, 112, 572, 1374, 1, 3, 820, 2474, 5, 7390, 21, 204, 26, 2474, 6, 40, 765, 20, 169, 834, 4179, 2860, 466, 5116, 556, 5116, 2, 601, 5116, 4, 1318, 2213, 1, 3, 4179, 4477, 9, 62, 169, 2860, 2512, 97, 107, 7, 5, 7390, 2, 535, 19, 21126, 19, 488, 2, 19, 488, 9, 2860, 14, 18, 2, 27, 106, 622, 522, 4179, 2860, 2, 1747, 5940, 1967, 9, 100, 6, 10182, 80, 7390, 3560, 76, 182, 3560, 820, 258, 199, 7, 32, 1327, 41, 5, 8, 4179, 2381, 7155, 8, 1053, 3988, 1, 820, 2, 3, 145, 292, 157, 6259, 19, 15146, 798, 3861, 1247, 1248, 6, 3, 3290, 3082, 1, 26, 681, 1633, 1162, 46, 74, 309, 17, 112, 5940, 2, 622, 2558, 5875, 3, 34, 2855, 4, 46, 1000, 1184, 4999, 154, 4792, 4898, 2012, 2, 1225, 4, 3, 473, 1, 7, 5, 7390, 9, 953, 1847, 138, 47, 1145, 6, 40, 108, 68, 2760, 2806, 1142, 695, 17, 47, 22186, 638, 20, 260, 820, 258, 3702, 6616]",,17033968,641
Comparative genomic and functional analyses reveal a novel cis-acting PTEN regulatory element as a highly conserved functional E-box motif deleted in Cowden syndrome.,Human molecular genetics,Hum. Mol. Genet.,2007-03-06,"Germline mutations in PTEN, encoding a phosphatase on 10q23, cause Cowden syndrome (CS) and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS). Approximately, 10% of CS-related PTEN mutations occur in the PTEN promoter and 11% of BRRS-related mutations include large deletions, often favoring the gene's 5' end (exon 1, promoter). In order to better understand the mechanism(s) underlying the deregulation of PTEN in these syndromes, it is important that functional cis-regulatory elements be identified. We employed a comparative genomic approach combined with molecular genetic techniques to identify a highly conserved sequence upstream of the PTEN promoter, sharing 80% sequence identity among Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus. Within this region, we identified a canonical E-box sequence (CACGTG) located at position -2181 to -2176, approximately 800 bp upstream of the PTEN core promoter and more than 1.1 kb upstream of its minimal promoter region (located at -958 to -821).

Imaging studies demonstrated well-circumscribed lesions in the pineal region. All patients presented with obstructive hydrocephalus and symptoms attributable to hydrocephalus and tectal compression. All three patients underwent near total microsurgical resection of the pineal region neoplasm, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy.

Differential expression of PTEN-targeting microRNAs miR-19a and miR-21 in Cowden syndrome.,American journal of human genetics,Am. J. Hum. Genet.,2008-05-01,"Germline mutations in the gene encoding phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN [MIM 601728]) are associated with a number of clinically distinct heritable cancer syndromes, including both Cowden syndrome (CS) and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS). Seemingly identical pathogenic PTEN mutations have been observed in patients with CS and BRRS, as well as in patients with incomplete features of CS, referred to as CS-like (CSL) patients. These observations indicate that additional, unidentified, genetic and epigenetic factors act as phenotypic modifiers in these disorders. These genetic factors could also contribute to disease in patients with CS, CSL, or BRRS without identifiable PTEN mutations. Two potential modifiers are miR-19a and miR-21, which are previously identified PTEN-targeting miRNAs. We investigated the role of these miRNAs by characterizing their relative expression levels in PTEN-mutation-positive and PTEN-mutation-negative patients with CS, CSL, or BRRS. Interestingly, we observed differential expression of miR-19a and miR-21 in our PTEN-mutation-positive patients. Both were found to be significantly overexpressed within this group (p < 0.01) and were inversely correlated with germline PTEN protein levels. Similarly, the relative expression of miR-19a and miR-21 was differentially expressed in a series of PTEN-mutation-negative patients with CS or CSL with variable clinical phenotypes and decreased full-length PTEN protein expression. Among PTEN-mutation-positive patients with CS, both miRNAs were significantly overexpressed (p = 0.006-0.013). Taken together, our study results suggest that differential expression of PTEN-targeting miR-19a and miR-21 modulates the PTEN protein levels and the CS and CSL phenotypes, irrespective of the patient's mutation status, and support their roles as genetic modifiers in CS and CSL.",Journal Article,4282.0,92.0,Germline mutations in the gene encoding phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten PTEN MIM 601728 are associated with a number of clinically distinct heritable cancer syndromes including both Cowden syndrome CS and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome BRRS Seemingly identical pathogenic PTEN mutations have been observed in patients with CS and BRRS as well as in patients with incomplete features of CS referred to as CS-like CSL patients These observations indicate that additional unidentified genetic and epigenetic factors act as phenotypic modifiers in these disorders These genetic factors could also contribute to disease in patients with CS CSL or BRRS without identifiable PTEN mutations Two potential modifiers are miR-19a and miR-21 which are previously identified PTEN-targeting miRNAs We investigated the role of these miRNAs by characterizing their relative expression levels in PTEN-mutation-positive and PTEN-mutation-negative patients with CS CSL or BRRS Interestingly we observed differential expression of miR-19a and miR-21 in our PTEN-mutation-positive patients Both were found to be significantly overexpressed within this group p 0.01 and were inversely correlated with germline PTEN protein levels Similarly the relative expression of miR-19a and miR-21 was differentially expressed in a series of PTEN-mutation-negative patients with CS or CSL with variable clinical phenotypes and decreased full-length PTEN protein expression Among PTEN-mutation-positive patients with CS both miRNAs were significantly overexpressed p 0.006-0.013 Taken together our study results suggest that differential expression of PTEN-targeting miR-19a and miR-21 modulates the PTEN protein levels and the CS and CSL phenotypes irrespective of the patient 's mutation status and support their roles as genetic modifiers in CS and CSL,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[1009, 138, 4, 3, 145, 2362, 2577, 2, 6111, 3412, 4389, 23, 1170, 1618, 820, 9752, 76042, 32, 41, 5, 8, 207, 1, 505, 834, 6874, 12, 2040, 141, 110, 5561, 681, 2188, 2, 12484, 12485, 12486, 681, 10860, 11405, 3038, 2806, 820, 138, 47, 85, 164, 4, 7, 5, 2188, 2, 10860, 22, 149, 22, 4, 7, 5, 2610, 404, 1, 2188, 1995, 6, 22, 2188, 733, 13037, 7, 46, 2172, 1008, 17, 402, 10039, 336, 2, 1418, 130, 2559, 22, 3290, 5663, 4, 46, 1997, 46, 336, 130, 359, 120, 1248, 6, 34, 4, 7, 5, 2188, 13037, 15, 10860, 187, 6237, 820, 138, 100, 174, 5663, 32, 722, 18545, 2, 722, 239, 92, 32, 373, 108, 820, 529, 2028, 21, 565, 3, 200, 1, 46, 2028, 20, 5723, 136, 580, 55, 148, 4, 820, 258, 109, 2, 820, 258, 199, 7, 5, 2188, 13037, 15, 10860, 2873, 21, 164, 1777, 55, 1, 722, 18545, 2, 722, 239, 4, 114, 820, 258, 109, 7, 110, 11, 204, 6, 40, 97, 1711, 262, 26, 87, 19, 13, 355, 2, 11, 2659, 438, 5, 1009, 820, 178, 148, 1813, 3, 580, 55, 1, 722, 18545, 2, 722, 239, 10, 2478, 570, 4, 8, 988, 1, 820, 258, 199, 7, 5, 2188, 15, 13037, 5, 1347, 38, 2618, 2, 340, 1647, 1318, 820, 178, 55, 107, 820, 258, 109, 7, 5, 2188, 110, 2028, 11, 97, 1711, 19, 13, 1861, 13, 3612, 1633, 1162, 114, 45, 99, 309, 17, 1777, 55, 1, 820, 529, 722, 18545, 2, 722, 239, 5259, 3, 820, 178, 148, 2, 3, 2188, 2, 13037, 2618, 3500, 1, 3, 69, 292, 258, 156, 2, 538, 136, 1790, 22, 336, 5663, 4, 2188, 2, 13037]",,18460397,391

These allelic disorders, Cowden syndrome, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, Proteus syndrome, and Proteus-like syndrome are associated with unregulated cellular proliferation leading to the formation of hamartomas. Thus far, an increased risk of malignancy has only been documented in Cowden syndrome; however, current recommendations advise that all individuals with PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome follow the cancer surveillance strategies suggested for Cowden syndrome until further data indicate otherwise. Because any individual phenotypic feature of Cowden syndrome and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome are frequently present in the general population, many individuals often go undiagnosed and consequently do not benefit from available cancer surveillance strategies.

A clinical scoring system for selection of patients for PTEN mutation testing is proposed on the basis of a prospective study of 3042 probands.,American journal of human genetics,Am. J. Hum. Genet.,2010-12-30,"Cowden syndrome (CS) and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome are allelic, defined by germline PTEN mutations, and collectively referred to as PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome. To date, there are no existing criteria based on large prospective patient cohorts to select patients for PTEN mutation testing. To address these issues, we conducted a multicenter prospective study in which 3042 probands satisfying relaxed CS clinical criteria were accrued. PTEN mutation scanning, including promoter and large deletion analysis, was performed for all subjects. Pathogenic mutations were identified in 290 individuals (9.5%). To evaluate clinical phenotype and PTEN genotype against protein expression, we performed immunoblotting (PTEN, P-AKT1, P-MAPK1/2) for a patient subset (n = 423). In order to obtain an individualized estimation of pretest probability of germline PTEN mutation, we developed an optimized clinical practice model to identify adult and pediatric patients. For adults, a semiquantitative score-the Cleveland Clinic (CC) score-resulted in a well-calibrated estimation of pretest probability of PTEN status. Overall, decreased PTEN protein expression correlated with PTEN mutation status; decreasing PTEN protein expression correlated with increasing CC score (p < 0.001), but not with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria (p = 0.11).

In this study, we have demonstrated that MV strains genetically engineered to express the human sodium iodide symporter (NIS) have significant antitumor activity against glioma lines and orthotopic xenografts; this compares favorably with the MV strain expressing the human carcinoembryonic antigen, which is currently in clinical testing. Expression of NIS protein in infected cells results in effective concentration of radioactive iodine, which allows for in vivo monitoring of localization of MV-NIS infection by measuring uptake of (123)I or (99m)Tc. In addition, radiovirotherapy with MV-NIS followed by (131)I administration resulted in significant increase of MV-NIS antitumor activity as compared with virus alone in both subcutaneous (p=0.0003) and orthotopic (p=0.004) glioblastoma models.

We sought to identify PTEN loss by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in sporadic and CS-associated TL to determine whether IHC is a useful tool to assess an individual for CS. Six TL biopsies associated with CS and 33 biopsies without CS were retrieved. IHC for PTEN was performed. RESULTS were scored as positive (reactivity in TL cells) or negative (no reactivity in TL cells); normal squamous epithelium and vascular endothelium served as internal positive controls. Complete PTEN loss was noted in 5/6 (83%) CS-associated TL and 1/33 (3%) sporadic (non-CS) TL. Demonstration of complete PTEN loss in TL by IHC is strongly suggestive of association with CS, but retention of PTEN staining does not entirely exclude CS.

Improved understanding of the underpinnings of the genetic pathways underlying these syndromes and the rapid evolution of targeted therapies in general have made it possible to develop therapeutic options for these patients and other genetic cancer syndromes. Targeted therapies especially antiangiogenics and inhibitors of the PIK3CA/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway have shown activity in selected group of patients affected by these syndromes or in patients harboring specific sporadic mutations which are otherwise characteristic of these syndromes. Unfortunately due to the rare nature, patients with these syndromes are not the focus of clinical trials and unique results seen in these patients can easily go unnoticed. Most of the data suggesting benefits of targeted therapies are either case reports or small case series. Thus, a literature review was indicated. In this review we explore the use of molecularly targeted therapy options in Von Hippel-Lindau disease, Cowden syndrome, and Proteus syndrome.

Cancer-predisposition gene KLLN maintains pericentric H3K9 trimethylation protecting genomic stability.,Nucleic acids research,Nucleic Acids Res.,2015-12-15,"Maintenance of proper chromatin states and genomic stability is vital for normal development and health across a range of organisms. Here, we report on the role of KLLN in maintenance of pericentric H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and genomic stability. Germline hypermethylation of KLLN, a gene uncovered well after the human genome project, has been linked to Cowden cancer-predisposition syndrome (CS) in PTEN wild-type cases. KLLN first identified as a p53-dependent tumor suppressor gene, was believed to bind randomly to DNA and cause S-phase arrest. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation-based sequencing (ChIP-seq), we demonstrated that KLLN binds to DNA regions enriched with H3K9me3. KLLN overexpression correlated with increased H3K9 methyltransferase activity and increased global H3K9me3, while knockdown of KLLN had an opposite effect. We also found KLLN to localize to pericentric regions, with loss of KLLN resulting in dysregulation of pericentric heterochromatin, with consequent chromosomal instability manifested by increased micronuclei formation and numerical chromosomal aberrations. Interestingly, we show that KLLN interacts with DBC1, with consequent abrogation of DBC1 inhibition of SUV39H1, a H3K9 methyltransferase, suggesting the mode of KLLN regulating H3K9me3. These results suggest a critical role for KLLN as a potential regulator of pericentric heterochromatin formation, genomic stability and gene expression.",Journal Article,1498.0,8.0,Maintenance of proper chromatin states and genomic stability is vital for normal development and health across a range of organisms Here we report on the role of KLLN in maintenance of pericentric H3K9 trimethylation H3K9me3 and genomic stability Germline hypermethylation of KLLN a gene uncovered well after the human genome project has been linked to Cowden cancer-predisposition syndrome CS in PTEN wild-type cases KLLN first identified as a p53-dependent tumor suppressor gene was believed to bind randomly to DNA and cause S-phase arrest Using chromatin immunoprecipitation-based sequencing ChIP-seq we demonstrated that KLLN binds to DNA regions enriched with H3K9me3 KLLN overexpression correlated with increased H3K9 methyltransferase activity and increased global H3K9me3 while knockdown of KLLN had an opposite effect We also found KLLN to localize to pericentric regions with loss of KLLN resulting in dysregulation of pericentric heterochromatin with consequent chromosomal instability manifested by increased micronuclei formation and numerical chromosomal aberrations Interestingly we show that KLLN interacts with DBC1 with consequent abrogation of DBC1 inhibition of SUV39H1 a H3K9 methyltransferase suggesting the mode of KLLN regulating H3K9me3 These results suggest a critical role for KLLN as a potential regulator of pericentric heterochromatin formation genomic stability and gene expression,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[1146, 1, 4576, 2287, 907, 2, 572, 2769, 16, 3511, 9, 295, 193, 2, 341, 716, 8, 184, 1, 9694, 467, 21, 414, 23, 3, 200, 1, 7286, 4, 1146, 1, 26937, 12917, 13980, 17462, 2, 572, 2769, 1009, 2575, 1, 7286, 8, 145, 5601, 149, 50, 3, 171, 898, 3105, 71, 85, 1199, 6, 5561, 12, 2863, 681, 2188, 4, 820, 955, 267, 140, 7286, 157, 108, 22, 8, 624, 470, 30, 1245, 145, 10, 3979, 6, 4060, 1108, 6, 261, 2, 708, 695, 124, 1854, 75, 2287, 4857, 90, 615, 4222, 4185, 21, 264, 17, 7286, 3333, 6, 261, 1374, 2220, 5, 17462, 7286, 851, 438, 5, 101, 12917, 3747, 128, 2, 101, 1648, 17462, 369, 1563, 1, 7286, 42, 35, 7021, 254, 21, 120, 204, 7286, 6, 8031, 6, 26937, 1374, 5, 407, 1, 7286, 1113, 4, 3935, 1, 26937, 23608, 5, 8436, 1860, 1753, 6023, 20, 101, 27600, 1264, 2, 8736, 1860, 2152, 2873, 21, 514, 17, 7286, 5528, 5, 39261, 5, 8436, 8589, 1, 39261, 297, 1, 29734, 8, 12917, 3747, 802, 3, 4530, 1, 7286, 2681, 17462, 46, 99, 309, 8, 740, 200, 9, 7286, 22, 8, 174, 2452, 1, 26937, 23608, 1264, 572, 2769, 2, 145, 55]",,26673699,25
Characterization of cryptic splicing in germline PTEN intronic variants in Cowden syndrome.,Human mutation,Hum. Mutat.,2017-07-17,"Germline mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene PTEN predispose to subsets of Cowden syndrome (CS), Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, and autism. Evidence-based classification of PTEN variants as either deleterious or benign is urgently needed for accurate molecular diagnosis and gene-informed genetic counseling. We studied 34 different germline PTEN intronic variants from 61 CS patients, characterized their PTEN mRNA processing, and analyzed PTEN expression and downstream readouts of P-AKT and P-ERK1/2. While we found that many mutations near splice junctions result in exon skipping, we also identified the presence of cryptic splicing that resulted in premature termination or a shift in isoform usage. PTEN protein expression is significantly lower in the group with splicing changes while P-AKT, but not P-ERK1/2, is significantly increased. Our observations of these PTEN intronic variants should contribute to the determination of pathogenicity of PTEN intronic variants and aid in genetic counseling.",Journal Article,918.0,10.0,Germline mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene PTEN predispose to subsets of Cowden syndrome CS Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome and autism Evidence-based classification of PTEN variants as either deleterious or benign is urgently needed for accurate molecular diagnosis and gene-informed genetic counseling We studied 34 different germline PTEN intronic variants from 61 CS patients characterized their PTEN mRNA processing and analyzed PTEN expression and downstream readouts of P-AKT and P-ERK1/2 While we found that many mutations near splice junctions result in exon skipping we also identified the presence of cryptic splicing that resulted in premature termination or a shift in isoform usage PTEN protein expression is significantly lower in the group with splicing changes while P-AKT but not P-ERK1/2 is significantly increased Our observations of these PTEN intronic variants should contribute to the determination of pathogenicity of PTEN intronic variants and aid in genetic counseling,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[1009, 138, 4, 3, 30, 1245, 145, 820, 6043, 6, 1890, 1, 5561, 681, 2188, 12484, 12485, 12486, 681, 2, 19955, 241, 90, 947, 1, 820, 839, 22, 361, 3586, 15, 1002, 16, 5354, 575, 9, 1481, 219, 147, 2, 145, 2767, 336, 2011, 21, 656, 562, 338, 1009, 820, 7998, 839, 29, 713, 2188, 7, 765, 136, 820, 956, 3325, 2, 311, 820, 55, 2, 1489, 19040, 1, 19, 649, 2, 19, 3533, 18, 369, 21, 204, 17, 445, 138, 1829, 4371, 10262, 757, 4, 1725, 11495, 21, 120, 108, 3, 463, 1, 10294, 3895, 17, 627, 4, 5682, 7202, 15, 8, 3024, 4, 3995, 5015, 820, 178, 55, 16, 97, 280, 4, 3, 87, 5, 3895, 400, 369, 19, 649, 84, 44, 19, 3533, 18, 16, 97, 101, 114, 2172, 1, 46, 820, 7998, 839, 257, 1248, 6, 3, 3104, 1, 8349, 1, 820, 7998, 839, 2, 2427, 4, 336, 2011]",,28677221,525
