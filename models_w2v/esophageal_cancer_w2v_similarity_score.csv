Salvage esophagectomy for recurrent tumors after definitive chemotherapy and radiotherapy.,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg.,2002-01-01,"Some patients and oncologists choose to treat localized esophageal cancer with definitive chemotherapy and radiation therapy rather than surgery. A subset of these patients have local relapse without distant metastases and therefore have no other curative intent treatment option but salvage esophagectomy. We reviewed our experience with salvage esophagectomy from 1987 to 2000 at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (n = 13, salvage after chemotherapy and radiotherapy group) and compared the data with those of patients receiving esophagectomy in a planned fashion 4 to 6 weeks after preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy (n = 99, preoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy group). Increases in morbidity were seen after resection in the salvage after chemotherapy and radiotherapy group relative to the preoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy group: mechanical ventilation (9.0 days vs 3.3 days, P =.08), intensive care unit stay (11.2 days vs 5.1 days, P =.07), hospital stay (29.4 days vs 18.4 days, P =.03), and anastomotic leak rates (5/13 [39%] vs 7/99 [7%], P =.005). Operative mortality (within 30 days) also tended to be increased statistically nonsignificantly (2/13 [15%] vs 6/99 [6%], P =.2). Salvage esophagectomy resulted in long-term survival (25% 5-year survival) in a subset of patients. Improved survival after salvage esophagectomy was associated with early pathologic stage (T1 N0, T2 N0), prolonged time to relapse, and R0 surgical resection. Patients who undergo salvage esophagectomy for relapse of tumor after definitive chemoradiation therapy have increased morbidity, mortality, and hospital use relative to patients undergoing planned esophagectomy after preoperative chemoradiation. Nevertheless, long-term survival can be achieved in this group, and such treatment should be considered for carefully selected patients at an experienced center.",Journal Article,6594.0,194.0,Some patients and oncologists choose to treat localized cancer with definitive chemotherapy and radiation therapy rather than surgery A subset of these patients have local relapse without distant metastases and therefore have no other curative intent treatment option but salvage esophagectomy We reviewed our experience with salvage esophagectomy from 1987 to 2000 at M.D Anderson Cancer Center n 13 salvage after chemotherapy and radiotherapy group and compared the data with those of patients receiving esophagectomy in a planned fashion 4 to 6 weeks after preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy n 99 preoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy group Increases in morbidity were seen after resection in the salvage after chemotherapy and radiotherapy group relative to the preoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy group mechanical ventilation 9.0 days vs 3.3 days P =.08 intensive care unit stay 11.2 days vs 5.1 days P =.07 hospital stay 29.4 days vs 18.4 days P =.03 and anastomotic leak rates 5/13 39 vs 7/99 7 P =.005 Operative mortality within 30 days also tended to be increased statistically nonsignificantly 2/13 15 vs 6/99 6 P =.2 Salvage esophagectomy resulted in long-term survival 25 5-year survival in a subset of patients Improved survival after salvage esophagectomy was associated with early pathologic stage T1 N0 T2 N0 prolonged time to relapse and R0 surgical resection Patients who undergo salvage esophagectomy for relapse of tumor after definitive chemoradiation therapy have increased morbidity mortality and hospital use relative to patients undergoing planned esophagectomy after preoperative chemoradiation Nevertheless long-term survival can be achieved in this group and such treatment should be considered for carefully selected patients at an experienced center,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[476, 7, 2, 1339, 6009, 6, 943, 909, 12, 5, 1057, 56, 2, 121, 36, 1832, 76, 152, 8, 697, 1, 46, 7, 47, 293, 429, 187, 626, 196, 2, 673, 47, 77, 127, 1075, 1697, 24, 1501, 84, 992, 3617, 21, 446, 114, 730, 5, 992, 3617, 29, 5450, 6, 1081, 28, 188, 427, 1929, 12, 574, 78, 233, 992, 50, 56, 2, 310, 87, 2, 72, 3, 74, 5, 135, 1, 7, 357, 3617, 4, 8, 1465, 3240, 39, 6, 49, 244, 50, 498, 56, 2, 121, 36, 78, 1058, 498, 56, 2, 310, 87, 1106, 4, 787, 11, 527, 50, 170, 4, 3, 992, 50, 56, 2, 310, 87, 580, 6, 3, 498, 56, 2, 310, 87, 6065, 7845, 83, 13, 162, 105, 27, 27, 162, 19, 1592, 1686, 165, 2712, 2020, 175, 18, 162, 105, 33, 14, 162, 19, 1615, 702, 2020, 462, 39, 162, 105, 203, 39, 162, 19, 680, 2, 4818, 4238, 151, 33, 233, 587, 105, 67, 1058, 67, 19, 1614, 1208, 282, 262, 201, 162, 120, 3886, 6, 40, 101, 712, 17078, 18, 233, 167, 105, 49, 1058, 49, 19, 18, 992, 3617, 627, 4, 319, 337, 25, 243, 33, 111, 25, 4, 8, 697, 1, 7, 231, 25, 50, 992, 3617, 10, 41, 5, 191, 510, 82, 1534, 3394, 1786, 3394, 1069, 98, 6, 429, 2, 2328, 221, 170, 7, 54, 1251, 992, 3617, 9, 429, 1, 30, 50, 1057, 975, 36, 47, 101, 787, 282, 2, 702, 119, 580, 6, 7, 479, 1465, 3617, 50, 498, 975, 3873, 319, 337, 25, 122, 40, 513, 4, 26, 87, 2, 225, 24, 257, 40, 515, 9, 3900, 715, 7, 28, 35, 592, 574]",1804.0,11782772,6

A Phase I study was conducted to evaluate sequential treatment with bolus IV doxorubicin followed 48 h later by topotecan given as a 30-min i.v. infusion on 3 consecutive days, with additional cycles of therapy repeated every 3 weeks. Characteristics of the 22 patients entered into the study were: 13 male and 9 female; median age, 49.5 (range 33-66) years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, 0-1; and normal cardiac, hematological, hepatic, and renal function. All patients had received prior therapy (median >or=2 prior regimens). The maximum tolerated dose of the combination was 25 mg/m(2) doxorubicin and 5.25 mg/m(2) topotecan (1.75 mg/m(2)/day x 3). Neutropenia was the dose-limiting toxicity. Attempts to further escalate the dose using 5 microg/kg granulocyte colony-stimulating factor proved unsuccessful because of thrombocytopenia. Among the 17 patients who were evaluable for response, 6 had a partial response, and 4 showed evidence of disease stabilization. The partial responses occurred in patients with small cell lung cancer (3 of 7), non-small cell lung cancer (1 of 6), esophageal adenocarcinoma (1 of 2), and ovarian carcinoma (1 of 1), and it lasted for 3-6 months. Administration of doxorubicin 2 days before topotecan did not alter topotecan pharmacokinetics. Changes in topoisomerase mRNA levels were observed during chemotherapy.

Esophageal cancer and the esophagus: challenges and potential strategies for selective cytoprotection of the tumor-bearing organ during cancer treatment.,Seminars in radiation oncology,Semin Radiat Oncol,2002-01-01,"Esophageal cancer is treated optimally with a combined-modality approach according to most clinical investigators. Cytotoxic chemotherapy and ionizing radiotherapy, given in a concomitant schedule, has yielded superior survival rates compared with radiotherapy alone. However, mucosal toxicity from such treatment may compromise quality of life and may mandate an unscheduled break in therapy in some patients who do not respond readily to standard treatments such as antacids; combinations of viscous xylocaine, aluminum hydroxide-magnesium carbonate, and diphenhydramine hydrochloride; oral liquid morphine sulfate, hydrocodone bitartrate, or acetaminophen. Hence, a number of alternative strategies that are designed to either prevent or limit toxicity to normal tissues without diminishing the antitumor effect are being tested. These include the use of conformal radiotherapy treatment planning techniques, amifostine (Ethyol, WR-2721), gene therapy via intratumoral injection of manganese superoxide dismutase-plasmid/liposome, glutamine, melatonin, omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids, transforming growth factor, flavonoid compounds, probucol, and keratinizing growth factor.

A phase III comparison of radiation therapy with or without recombinant beta-interferon for poor-risk patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (RTOG 93-04).,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2002-04-01,"The results of Phase I/II data testing beta-interferon with radiation therapy in a non-small-cell lung cancer population were promising. Based on these data, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) initiated a Phase III trial to test the efficacy of beta-interferon in poor-risk patients with Stages IIIA and IIIB non-small-cell lung carcinoma. Between September 1994 and March 1998, 123 patients were accrued to this trial. Enrolled patients were not eligible for other chemoradiation studies within the RTOG. Eligibility criteria included histologically confirmed Stage IIIA or IIIB non-small-cell lung cancer (according to American Joint Committee on Cancer) considered clinically inoperable or unresectable at the time of surgery. Patients were required to have a Karnofsky performance status 50-70 or >70 and at least 5% weight loss over the preceding 3 months. Betaseron (recombinant human interferon beta(ser), rHuIFN-beta(ser),) was the chosen preparation of beta-interferon. The patients randomized to the investigational arm received 16 x 10(6) IU of Betaseron by i.v. bolus given 3 days a week (Monday-Wednesday) on Weeks 1, 3, and 5. The Betaseron was given 30 minutes before radiation therapy for a total of nine doses. Irradiation was delivered at 2 Gy per fraction, 5 days a week, for a total of 60 Gy over 6 weeks and was identical for both arms. The primary end point of the trial was overall survival with local control as a secondary end point. Toxicities occurring within 90 days of therapy completion were defined as acute. The median follow-up was 4 years (range: 2.5-6 years) for surviving patients. Seventy-six percent of all patients completed beta-interferon. Toxicity was the primary reason for noncompliance. Radiotherapy (RT) compliance was excellent in the RT-alone arm, with 94% completing therapy, compared to 82% in the beta-interferon arm (p = 0.0475). Grade 3 and 4 acute toxicities were higher on the beta-interferon arm (p = 0.0249). Grade 3 and 4 acute toxicities were primarily related to lung (n = 8) and esophagus (n = 7). No Grade 4 or 5 late toxicities were seen for patients in the radiation-alone arm. However, three patients on the beta-interferon arm experienced Grade 4 toxicity, and one patient died. The 1-year survival rate for the RT-alone arm was 44% with a median survival time of 9.5 months. The 1-year survival on the beta-interferon arm was 42% with a median survival of 10.3 months. There was no statistical difference in survival times (p = 0.66). This multicenter, controlled Phase III trial failed to confirm the efficacy of Betaseron in patients receiving definitive radiotherapy for locally advanced, nonmetastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. The use of beta-interferon led to greater rates of both acute and late treatment-related toxicity. The RTOG continues to investigate other biologic modifiers that may provide a nontoxic alternative for this poor-risk population.",Clinical Trial,6504.0,29.0,The results of Phase I/II data testing beta-interferon with radiation therapy in a non-small-cell cancer population were promising Based on these data the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group RTOG initiated a Phase III trial to test the efficacy of beta-interferon in poor-risk patients with Stages IIIA and IIIB non-small-cell carcinoma Between September 1994 and March 1998 123 patients were accrued to this trial Enrolled patients

Phase II trial of docetaxel chemotherapy in patients with incurable adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.,Investigational new drugs,Invest New Drugs,2002-02-01,"Chemotherapy remains the primary mode of treatment for metastatic carcinoma of the esophagus. The efficacy of various chemotherapeutic regimens has been studied predominantly in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. In light of the increasing incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, studies evaluating newer chemotherapy agents, such as docetaxel, in this patient population are necessary. The objective of this trial was to determine the complete and partial response rate of docetaxel in patients with incurable adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Eligible patients had histologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or locally extensive disease not curable with surgery or radiation therapy. Patients were either chemotherapy naive or previously treated with chemotherapy (including paclitaxel). Docetaxel was administered at a dose of 75 mg/m2 every three weeks intravenously. Appropriate imaging studies/examinations were obtained after every two cycles to evaluate response. A total of 22 patients were enrolled in the trial. Chemotherapy-naive patients achieved a response rate of 18% (95% CI = 2.3 to 51.8) while patients who received prior chemotherapy achieved a 0% response rate (95% CI = 0 to 25). There were no complete responses. The overall median survival time is 3.4 months and the one-year survival rate is 21%. The toxicities included febrile neutropenia (32%) as well as grade 3 and 4 fatigue (14%) and anorexia (9%).

Oxaliplatin in combination with protracted-infusion fluorouracil and radiation: report of a clinical trial for patients with esophageal cancer.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2002-06-01,"To identify a dose and schedule of oxaliplatin (OXP) to be safely administered in combination with protracted-infusion (PI) fluorouracil (5-FU) and external-beam radiation therapy (XRT) for patients with primary esophageal carcinoma (EC). Eligibility included therapeutically naïve EC patients with clinical disease stages II, III, or IV. Initial doses and schedules for cycle 1 consisted of OXP 85 mg/m(2) on days 1, 15, and 29; PI 5-FU 180 mg/m(2) for 24 hours for 35 days; and XRT 1.8 Gy in 28 fractions starting on day 8. At completion of cycle 1, eligible patients could undergo an operation or begin cycle 2 without XRT. Postoperative patients were eligible for cycle 2. Stage IV patients were allowed three cycles in the absence of disease progression. OXP and 5-FU increases were based on dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) encountered in cohorts of three consecutive patients. Thirty-eight eligible patients received therapy: 22 noninvasively staged as IV and 16 noninvasively staged as II and III. Thirty-six patients completed cycle 1, 29 patients started cycle 2, and 24 patients completed cycle 2. The combined-modality therapy was well tolerated, but DLT prevented OXP and 5-FU escalation. No grade 4 hematologic toxicity was noted. Eleven grade 3 and two grade 4 clinical toxicities were noted in eight patients. After cycle 1, 29 patients (81%) had no cancer in the esophageal mucosa.

Potential role of selective COX-2 inhibitors in cancer management.,"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)","Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",2002-05-01,"Tumorigenesis is a complex process, and understanding the mechanisms behind tumorigenesis is key to identifying effective targeted therapies. Prostaglandins are signaling lipophilic molecules derived from phospholipids that are involved in normal physiologic functions. However, overexpression of prostaglandins has been associated with tumorigenesis. Several epidemiologic studies have shown an inverse correlation between the incidence of colon cancer and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. The NSAIDs target cyclooxygenases (COX), essential enzymes inprostaglandin production. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an inducible form of the enzyme that is usually not expressed in normal tissue. Because COX-2 is frequently overexpressed in premalignant lesions and neoplasms, specific COX-2 inhibitors have been investigatedas chemoprevention andpotential chemotherapeutic agents. There is now preclinical and early clinical data that suggest inhibitors of COX-2 may protect against colon, breast, lung, esophageal, and oral tumors. This paper will discuss evidence addressing the possible mechanistic contribution of COX-2 in tumorigenesis and will explore the link between COX-2 activity and carcinogenesis. The potential role of COX-2 inhibitors in the chemoprevention and treatment of various tumors will also be discussed.

"Irinotecan, cisplatin, and radiation in esophageal cancer.","Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)","Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",2002-05-01,"The limited effectiveness of currently available chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced esophageal cancer, and the poor survival achieved in locally advanced disease with combined chemoradiotherapy with or without surgery, have prompted the evaluation of new agents. Irinotecan (CPT-11, Camptosar) has promising single-agent activity in gastrointestinal cancers. In phase II evaluation of weekly irinotecan plus cisplatin, response rates have exceeded 30% in esophageal and gastric cancers. Irinotecan is an active radiosensitizer in preclinical studies and clinical trials in lung cancer. We performed a phase I trial of weekly irinotecan, cisplatin, and concurrent radiotherapy in locally advanced esophageal cancer. Induction chemotherapy with irinotecan and cisplatin was given prior to radiotherapy, over 6 weeks, cycled on a 2-week-on, 1-week-off schedule to relieve dysphagia. Radiotherapy was given subsequently in 180-cGy daily fractions to a total dose of 5,040 cGy. Doses of chemotherapy, when given with concurrent radiotherapy, were cisplatin at 30 mg/m2 followed by irinotecan at escalated doses (40, 50, 65, and 80 mg/m2), on days 1, 8, 22, and 29. Among 18 patients entered in the trial, minimal toxicity has been observed, with no grade 3/4 esophagitis or diarrhea. Hematologic toxicity has been minimal. Dose-limiting toxicity (ie, requiring more than a 2-week delay in radiotherapy) has been seen in one of three patients at the 80-mg/M2 irinotecan dose level, and accrual continues at this dose level. Among 13 evaluable patients, five complete responses have been seen (38%), including three pathologic complete responses in 10 patients undergoing surgery (30%). Asymptomatic pulmonary emboli were noted on the posttreatment computed tomography scan in 3 of 15 patients, prompting the addition of warfarin sodium (Coumadin) prophylaxis on protocol.

Gene Ther.,2002-07-01,"p14(ARF), a product of the INK4A/ARF locus, induces p53 upregulation by neutralizing the effects of MDM2, a transcriptional target of p53 that antagonizes its function. Here we report that adenovirus-mediated p14(ARF) gene transfer leads to the accumulation of ectopically transduced p53 and to apoptosis in human cancer cells. We constructed an adenoviral vector expressing p14(ARF) (Ad-ARF) and examined its synergistic effect with p53-expressing adenovirus (Ad5CMV-p53 or Ad-p53) in human lung and esophageal cancer cells. Simultaneous Ad-ARF and Ad-p53 infection increased p53 protein levels not only in a wild-type p53-expressing cell line, but also in cell lines with deleted p53. This resulted in a significant in vitro cytotoxicity compared with Ad-p53 infection alone. Coinfection of Ad-ARF and Ad-p53 also resulted in an increase in expression of p53-inducible genes, including p21(WAF-1/Cip1), p53R2, and Noxa. In addition, the growth of human lung cancer tumors subcutaneously implanted into nu/nu mice was inhibited significantly by intratumoral injection with Ad-ARF and Ad-p53. Our data demonstrate that overexpression of ectopic p14(ARF) may render cells more sensitive to p53-mediated apoptosis, an outcome that has important implications for the treatment of human cancers.",Comparative Study,6413.0,23.0,p14 ARF a product of the INK4A/ARF locus induces p53 upregulation by neutralizing the effects of MDM2 a transcriptional target of p53 that antagonizes its function Here we report that adenovirus-mediated p14 ARF gene transfer leads to the accumulation of ectopically transduced p53 and to apoptosis in human cancer cells We constructed an adenoviral vector expressing p14 ARF Ad-ARF and examined its synergistic effect with p53-expressing adenovirus Ad5CMV-p53 or Ad-p53 in human and cancer cells Simultaneous Ad-ARF and Ad-p53 infection increased p53 protein levels not only in a wild-type p53-expressing cell line but also in cell lines with deleted p53 This resulted in a significant in vitro cytotoxicity compared with Ad-p53 infection alone Coinfection of Ad-ARF and Ad-p53 also resulted in an increase in expression of p53-inducible genes including p21 WAF-1/Cip1 p53R2 and Noxa In addition the growth of human cancer tumors subcutaneously implanted into nu/nu mice was inhibited significantly by intratumoral injection with Ad-ARF and Ad-p53 Our data demonstrate that overexpression of ectopic p14 ARF may render cells more sensitive to p53-mediated apoptosis an outcome that has important implications for the treatment of human cancers,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[10556, 5509, 8, 2821, 1, 3, 6276, 5509, 2474, 1516, 624, 2218, 20, 5788, 3, 176, 1, 3277, 8, 1431, 283, 1, 624, 17, 11574, 211, 343, 467, 21, 414, 17, 4488, 517, 10556, 5509, 145, 2602, 1940, 6, 3, 1835, 1, 11744, 5042, 624, 2, 6, 351, 4, 171, 12, 37, 21, 2776, 35, 4771, 3374, 1046, 10556, 5509, 1985, 5509, 2, 409, 211, 1806, 254, 5, 624, 1046, 4488, 15873, 624, 15, 1985, 624, 4, 171, 2, 12, 37, 2824, 1985, 5509, 2, 1985, 624, 930, 101, 624, 178, 148, 44, 158, 4, 8, 955, 267, 624, 1046, 31, 328, 84, 120, 4, 31, 285, 5, 4389, 624, 26, 627, 4, 8, 93, 4, 439, 1408, 72, 5, 1985, 624, 930, 279, 27937, 1, 1985, 5509, 2, 1985, 624, 120, 627, 4, 35, 344, 4, 55, 1, 624, 2877, 214, 141, 2657, 24428, 14, 6927, 33274, 2, 7363, 4, 352, 3, 129, 1, 171, 12, 57, 3928, 3416, 237, 7699, 7699, 399, 10, 879, 97, 20, 2074, 1754, 5, 1985, 5509, 2, 1985, 624, 114, 74, 608, 17, 851, 1, 3647, 10556, 5509, 68, 7873, 37, 80, 745, 6, 624, 517, 351, 35, 228, 17, 71, 305, 1268, 9, 3, 24, 1, 171, 163]",1244.0,12162819,662

Treatment outcomes of resected esophageal cancer.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2002-09-01,"To assess the evolution of treatment and outcome for resected esophageal cancer at a single institution. Strategies for optimizing the treatment of resected esophageal cancer continue to evolve over time. The outcomes of these evolving treatments in the context of improved diagnostic staging and changing epidemiology have not been carefully analyzed in a single institution. One thousand ninety-seven consecutive patients with primary esophageal cancer underwent surgery during the period 1970 to 2001. Nine hundred ninety-four patients underwent curative esophagectomy and were analyzed for changing demographics. Eight hundred seventy-nine patients who did not have systemic metastases and survived the perioperative period were assessed by multivariate analysis for factors associated with long-term survival. During the study period the overall median survival increased from 17 to 34 months, and combined hospital and 30-day mortality decreased from 12% to 6%. The R0 resection rate increased from 78 to 94%, and adenocarcinoma replaced squamous cell carcinoma as the predominant histology (83% vs. 17%). No change in survival with time was noted for patients treated with surgery alone having the same postoperative pathologic stage (pTNM). An increased proportion of patients had preoperative chemoradiation in the last 4 years of the study (59% vs. 2%). Preoperative chemoradiation was associated with a longer survival and increased likelihood of achieving a complete resection. Multivariate analysis showed that long-term survival was associated with a complete resection and the preoperative staging strategy used, while the use of preoperative chemoradiation was the most significant factor associated with ability to achieve an R0 esophageal resection.

Phase I pharmacodynamic study of time and sequence dependency of hydroxyurea in combination with gemcitabine: a California Cancer Consortium Trial.,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol.,2002-09-12,"Preclinical studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that prior exposure to hydroxyurea increases the percentage of cells in S phase, enhancing the cytotoxicity of subsequent gemcitabine treatment in human oropharyngeal KB cells. To evaluate the clinical implications of this time- and sequence-dependent potentiation, we performed a phase I trial of hydroxyurea given over 24 h followed by a 30-min infusion of gemcitabine in weeks 1 and 2 of a 3-week cycle. The dose of hydroxyurea was fixed at 500 mg orally every 6 h for four doses starting 24 h before each dose of gemcitabine. The initial dose level of gemcitabine was 250 mg/m(2) on days 2 and 9, and this was escalated stepwise to 1000 mg/m(2) on days 2 and 9. Gemcitabine pharmacokinetics were determined on days 2 and 9 of the first cycle. Of 27 patients enrolled (12 female, 15 male), 24 were evaluable for response and 23 were evaluable for toxicity. Their median age was 56 years (range 27-76 years). Tumor types included lung, head and neck, pancreas, breast, colon, prostate, stomach, ovary, esophagus, germ cell, thyroid, gallbladder, and unknown primary. A total of 80 cycles of treatment were completed. One patient (unknown primary) had an objective partial response lasting 21 months, and 12 patients had stable disease. All observed dose-limiting toxicities were related to myelosuppression. The gemcitabine maximum tolerated dose was established at 750 mg/m(2) on days 2 and 9. Hydroxyurea had no effect on the plasma pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine. These results suggest that hydroxyurea followed by gemcitabine can be safely administered and has activity on this schedule.

Effect of concurrent radiation therapy and chemotherapy on pulmonary function in patients with esophageal cancer: dose-volume histogram analysis.,"Cancer journal (Sudbury, Mass.)",Cancer J,,"The pulmonary effects of concurrent radiation therapy and chemotherapy were studied in patients enrolled in a phase I trial for esophageal cancer. Pulmonary function tests were performed prospectively before and after combined-modality therapy (oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and radiation therapy) in 20 patients with esophageal cancer. Cumulative and differential lung DVH analysis from 0 to 5400 cGy in 25-cGy intervals was performed for the last 15 patients. Correlation between radiation exposure in various dose ranges and percent reduction in pulmonary function tests was calculated as an exploratory analysis. Significant reductions in carbon monoxide diffusion capacity corrected for hemoglobin (12.3%) and total lung capacity (2.5%) were evident at a median of 15.5 days after radiation therapy. DVH analysis revealed that the single dose of maximum correlation between lung volume radiation exposure and lung function reduction was less than 1000 cGy for all pulmonary functions. The percent lung volume that received a total dose between 700 and 1000 cGy maximally correlated with the percent reductions in total lung capacity and vital capacity, and the absolute lung volume that received a total dose between 700 and 1000 cGy maximally correlated with the percent reductions in total lung capacity, vital capacity, and carbon monoxide diffusion capacity. Significant declines in carbon monoxide diffusion capacity and total lung capacity are evident immediately after the administration of conformal radiation therapy, oxaliplatin, and 5-fluorouracil for esophageal cancer. Other lung functions remain statistically unchanged. The percent or absolute lung volume that received a total dose between 700 and 1000 cGy may be significantly correlated with the percent decline of carbon monoxide diffusion capacity, total lung capacity, and vital capacity.

Whole body 18FDG-PET and the response of esophageal cancer to induction therapy: results of a prospective trial.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2003-02-01,"Whole-body 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging before and after induction therapy was prospectively evaluated in patients with esophageal cancer to determine whether changes in PET images could measure response to therapy. Between April 1997 and April 1999, 39 patients (34 men and five women; median age, 59 years; range, 36 to 76 years) with esophageal cancer were prospectively enrolled in a single-institution clinical trial of staging, including PET, induction therapy, restaging including PET, and esophagectomy. All patients undergoing esophagectomy after induction therapy (n = 17) were followed either to recurrence, to death, or through a disease-free interval of at least 24 months. PET after standard staging studies and before therapy imaged undetected sites of metastatic disease in six patients (15%). Restaging (including PET) after induction therapy did not identify any patients with disease progression or any patients with loco-regionally unresectable disease at exploration. The median decrease in the standardized uptake value (SUV) during induction therapy was 59%. After R0 esophagectomy, the 2-year disease-free and overall survival was 38% and 63%, respectively, among patients who had a less than 60% decrease in SUV, and 67% and 89%, respectively, among patients who had a greater than 60% decrease in SUV (P =.055 and P =.088, respectively). Compared with conventional imaging, PET detects additional sites of metastatic disease at initial evaluation.

Phase I dose escalation trial of weekly docetaxel plus irinotecan in patients with advanced cancer.,Cancer biology & therapy,Cancer Biol. Ther.,,"Background. Docetaxel and irinotecan have additive or synergistic activity in vitro and in vivo as well as differing toxicities and unique mechanisms of action. We conducted a phase I trial to determine the maximum-tolerated dose of docetaxel and irinotecan given on a weekly schedule. Methods. Eligible patients had advanced, incurable, solid tumors. Docetaxel was administered as a 1-hour infusion and escalated over four dose levels (25, 30, 35, and 40 mg/m(2)) followed by irinotecan administered over 30 minutes at a fixed dose of 50 mg/m(2). Treatment was administered weekly for four weeks followed by two weeks of rest. To improve tolerability, the schedule was modified to weekly administration for two weeks with one week of rest, and irinotecan was escalated over 3 dose levels (55, 60, and 65 mg/m(2)) with docetaxel fixed at 35 mg/m(2). Results. Forty-four patients were treated and the most common dose-limiting toxicity was diarrhea observed in 11% of patients. Severe neutropenia was rare (grade 4: 2%, grade 3: 23%). Other nonhematologic toxicities included nausea/vomiting, dehydration and fatigue. Partial responses occurred in two patients with pancreatic cancer, and one patient each with non-small cell lung and esophageal cancer. Conclusions. Weekly docetaxel and irinotecan is a promising non-cisplatin doublet with preliminary evidence of activity in advanced solid tumors. Diarrhea is the predominant dose-limiting toxicity but unlike the every 3 weeks schedule myelosuppression is modest. The recommended phase II doses are docetaxel 35 mg/m(2) and irinotecan 60 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day schedule.

"Mature survival results with preoperative cisplatin, protracted infusion 5-fluorouracil, and 44-Gy radiotherapy for esophageal cancer.","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2003-06-01,"To assess the long-term survival results after cisplatin, protracted infusion 5-fluorouracil, and concurrent radiotherapy (RT) followed by surgical resection of esophageal cancer. Ninety-two patients with esophageal cancer (65 with adenocarcinoma and 27 with squamous cell carcinoma) were treated in two sequential protocols of preoperative chemoradiotherapy. The patients had tumor confined to the esophagus and regional nodes, including celiac nodes for middle and distal lesions. In trial A (1989-1994), 50 patients were treated with 44 Gy RT (2 Gy/d) along with concurrent 5-fluorouracil 300 mg/m(2)/d given by protracted venous infusion on Days 1-30 and cisplatin 26 mg/m(2) on Days 1-5 and 26-30. In trial B (1995-1997, 42 patients), the chemotherapy dosages during RT were reduced to 5-fluorouracil 225 mg/m(2)/d protracted venous infusion and cisplatin 20 mg/m(2)/d on Days 1-5 and 16-30; three cycles of paclitaxel 135 mg/m(2)and cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) were given postoperatively. Surgery generally occurred 4-6 weeks after completion of the planned preoperative therapy. Transhiatal resection was performed whenever possible. Of the 92 patients, 86 (93%) underwent surgery (1 refused, 2 died preoperatively, and 3 developed evidence of metastatic disease). Of the 92 patients, 80 (87%) had complete resections with negative margins (3 had positive margins and 3 had distant metastases discovered at surgery). The pathologic complete response rate was 33% (30 of 92). The median follow-up was 63.5 months. The median survival and disease-specific survival for all enrolled patients was 35 and 59 months, respectively. The 5-year survival and disease-specific survival rate was 40% and 49%, respectively. Patients with a pathologic complete response had a 67% survival rate at 5 years (median not reached), and the remainder of patients had a 5-year survival rate of 27% (median 21 months; p <0.001). For 21 patients alive after 5 years (60-121 months), 2 died of their disease and all others were disease free. Eight patients with pathologic Stage I tumor at the time of surgery had survival similar to those with a complete response to preoperative therapy. The median survival for patients with pathologic Stage IIA, IIB, III, and IV disease at the time of surgery was 22, 13.5, 18, and 4.9 months, respectively. The pattern of initial failure was local/regional alone in 6% (5 of 90), local/regional plus distant in 3% (3 of 90), and distant alone in 47% (42 of 90). No differences were noted in survival or response rate between those with adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. The promising 5-year survival results and low rate of late cancer-related deaths suggest that these regimens of intensive neoadjuvant therapy may improve the overall cure rate. The pathologic stage after neoadjuvant therapy is an important predictor of survival and may be useful in selecting patients for novel adjuvant therapies. Isolated local failure is uncommon, indicating that efforts to improve the therapeutic outcome should focus on optimizing systemic therapy rather than intensifying the RT. Additional randomized data are needed to assess the benefits of this therapeutic approach fully.",Clinical Trial,6078.0,57.0,To assess the long-term survival results after cisplatin protracted

With the emergence of data to suggest that single agent docetaxel and irinotecan carry antineoplastic effects in this setting, we determined the response rate of these agents when given in combination. Forty-six patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lower third of the esophagus, esophagogastric junction, and gastric cardia were evaluated. Patients received docetaxel 50 mg/m2/d and irinotecan 130 mg/m2/d intravenously at 21-d intervals with a tumor assessment after 2 cycles. Because of unacceptable toxicity among the first 13 patients, dosing was reduced to docetaxel 40 mg/m2/d and irinotecan 100 mg/m2/d intravenously at 21-d intervals. The response rate for the entire cohort was 26% (95% confidence interval: 14%, 41%) with 12 confirmed partial responses. Five of these 12 responses were observed in patients treated at the higher chemotherapy dose. However, because 8 of 13 patients suffered grade 4 neutropenia and fevers, a dose reduction was incorporated into the protocol, and the remainder of the cohort was treated at the lower dose. All except 4 of the 15 observed grade 4 toxicities occurred at the higher dose, and these toxicities included nausea and vomiting, dyspnea, hypotension, dysrhythmias, and diarrhea in addition to neutropenia and fevers. There were no grade 5 toxicities. The median survival for the entire cohort was 7.3 mo. The combination of docetaxel and irinotecan provides modest antineoplastic activity among patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, esophagogastric junction, and gastric cardia. Doses of docetaxel 40 mg/m2/d and irinotecan 100 mg/m2/d at 21-d intervals provide an acceptable safety profile, but higher doses appear to result in unacceptable toxicity.",Clinical Trial,6594.0,30.0,The incidence of adenocarcinoma of the lower third of the esophagogastric junction and cardia has been rising in the face of limited treatment options for patients with metastatic disease With the emergence of data to suggest that single agent docetaxel and irinotecan carry antineoplastic effects in this setting we determined the response rate of these agents when given in combination Forty-six patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lower third of the esophagogastric junction and cardia were evaluated Patients received docetaxel 50 mg/m2/d and irinotecan 130 mg/m2/d intravenously at 21-d intervals with a tumor assessment after 2 cycles Because of unacceptable toxicity among the first 13 patients dosing was reduced to docetaxel 40 mg/m2/d and irinotecan 100 mg/m2/d intravenously at 21-d intervals The response rate for the entire cohort was 26 95 confidence interval 14 41 with 12 confirmed partial responses Five of these 12 responses were observed in patients treated at the higher chemotherapy dose However because 8 of 13 patients suffered grade 4 neutropenia and fevers a dose reduction was incorporated into the protocol and the remainder of the cohort was treated at the lower dose All except 4 of the 15 observed grade 4 toxicities occurred at the higher dose and these toxicities included nausea and vomiting dyspnea hypotension dysrhythmias and diarrhea in addition to neutropenia and fevers There were no grade 5 toxicities The median survival for the entire cohort was 7.3 mo The combination of docetaxel and irinotecan provides modest antineoplastic activity among patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction and cardia Doses of docetaxel 40 mg/m2/d and irinotecan 100 mg/m2/d at 21-d intervals provide an acceptable safety profile but higher doses appear to result in unacceptable toxicity,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[3, 287, 1, 449, 1, 3, 280, 1282, 1, 3, 6330, 3322, 2, 9791, 71, 85, 3699, 4, 3, 3376, 1, 383, 24, 838, 9, 7, 5, 113, 34, 5, 3, 3397, 1, 74, 6, 309, 17, 226, 420, 621, 2, 1071, 3542, 3940, 176, 4, 26, 546, 21, 509, 3, 51, 116, 1, 46, 183, 198, 447, 4, 150, 1213, 437, 7, 5, 113, 449, 1, 3, 280, 1282, 1, 3, 6330, 3322, 2, 9791, 11, 194, 7, 103, 621, 212, 81, 821, 427, 2, 1071, 3431, 81, 821, 427, 1672, 28, 239, 427, 1582, 5, 8, 30, 455, 50, 18, 410, 408, 1, 3215, 155, 107, 3, 157, 233, 7, 1280, 10, 405, 6, 621, 327, 81, 821, 427, 2, 1071, 394, 81, 821, 427, 1672, 28, 239, 427, 1582, 3, 51, 116, 9, 3, 1797, 180, 10, 432, 48, 307, 268, 213, 605, 5, 133, 557, 450, 253, 365, 1, 46, 133, 253, 11, 164, 4, 7, 73, 28, 3, 142, 56, 61, 137, 408, 66, 1, 233, 7, 6388, 88, 39, 778, 2, 12488, 8, 61, 628, 10, 2449, 237, 3, 1182, 2, 3, 7095, 1, 3, 180, 10, 73, 28, 3, 280, 61, 62, 2187, 39, 1, 3, 167, 164, 88, 39, 385, 489, 28, 3, 142, 61, 2, 46, 385, 159, 1218, 2, 1966, 2923, 6577, 53561, 2, 1172, 4, 352, 6, 778, 2, 12488, 125, 11, 77, 88, 33, 385, 3, 52, 25, 9, 3, 1797, 180, 10, 67, 27, 2035, 3, 150, 1, 621, 2, 1071, 777, 1721, 3940, 128, 107, 7, 5, 449, 1, 3, 6330, 3322, 2, 9791, 415, 1, 621, 327, 81, 821, 427, 2, 1071, 394, 81, 821, 427, 28, 239, 427, 1582, 377, 35, 1595, 367, 800, 84, 142, 415, 1322, 6, 757, 4, 3215, 155]",1838.0,12794247,385
GI polyposis and glycogenic acanthosis of the esophagus associated with PTEN mutation positive Cowden syndrome in the absence of cutaneous manifestations.,The American journal of gastroenterology,Am. J. Gastroenterol.,2003-06-01,"A 62-yr-old man was referred for management of GI polyposis. Large bowel polyps were initially diagnosed >25 yr ago, and the patient had undergone multiple colonoscopies and polypectomies. Personal and family history were notable for thyroid goiter and hypothyroidism. Physical examination was notable for lingular papillomatosis. No cutaneous lesions were seen. Upper endoscopy revealed esophageal glycogen acanthosis. There were multiple polyps throughout the stomach and the small and large intestines. Histology of these polyps showed multiple cell types including juvenile polyps, inflammatory polyps with fibromuscular proliferation and lamina propria ganglion cells, and focal adenomatous change. A clinical diagnosis of Cowden syndrome was made. Mutation analysis revealed a variant in exon 8 of the PTEN gene. Direct sequencing revealed a germline heterozygous C.892-895InsA, which is predicted to result in a truncated PTEN protein. Cowden syndrome is an underdiagnosed, underrecognized, autosomal dominant, inherited syndrome. For the gastroenterologist, esophageal acanthosis and multiple hamartomatous polyps should suggest the diagnosis. Sensitive molecular diagnostic tests looking for mutations in the appropriate genes are clinically available. Together with genetic counseling, molecular diagnostic testing will allow more accurate risk assessment and surveillance for cancer for both the patient and family members.",Case Reports,6078.0,60.0,A 62-yr-old man was referred for management of GI polyposis Large bowel polyps were initially diagnosed 25 yr ago and the patient had undergone multiple colonoscopies and polypectomies Personal and family history were notable for goiter and hypothyroidism Physical examination was notable for lingular papillomatosis No cutaneous lesions were seen Upper endoscopy revealed glycogen acanthosis There were multiple polyps throughout the and the small and large intestines Histology of these polyps showed multiple cell types including juvenile polyps inflammatory polyps with fibromuscular proliferation and lamina propria ganglion cells and focal adenomatous change A clinical diagnosis of Cowden syndrome was made Mutation analysis revealed a variant in exon 8 of the PTEN gene Direct sequencing revealed a germline heterozygous C.892-895InsA which is predicted to result in a truncated PTEN protein Cowden syndrome is an underdiagnosed underrecognized autosomal dominant inherited syndrome For the gastroenterologist acanthosis and multiple hamartomatous polyps should suggest the diagnosis Sensitive molecular diagnostic tests looking for mutations in the appropriate genes are clinically available Together with genetic counseling molecular diagnostic testing will allow more accurate risk assessment and surveillance for cancer for both the patient and family members,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,"[8, 744, 2830, 1095, 3628, 10, 1995, 9, 284, 1, 2104, 4198, 375, 1659, 3742, 11, 1625, 265, 243, 2830, 5028, 2, 3, 69, 42, 1989, 232, 15203, 2, 43278, 3008, 2, 607, 532, 11, 4090, 9, 16309, 2, 4147, 900, 1385, 10, 4090, 9, 53590, 22118, 77, 1486, 406, 11, 527, 1726, 4199, 553, 9482, 30436, 125, 11, 232, 3742, 2432, 3, 2, 3, 302, 2, 375, 26180, 784, 1, 46, 3742, 224, 232, 31, 630, 141, 7857, 3742, 1291, 3742, 5, 30437, 457, 2, 12503, 10859, 15570, 37, 2, 2137, 4865, 707, 8, 38, 147, 1, 5561, 681, 10, 1229, 258, 65, 553, 8, 1142, 4, 1725, 66, 1, 3, 820, 145, 1196, 615, 553, 8, 1009, 4167, 256, 15571, 53591, 92, 16, 783, 6, 757, 4, 8, 6502, 820, 178, 5561, 681, 16, 35, 21160, 16739, 6084, 2156, 2986, 681, 9, 3, 24620, 30436, 2, 232, 12332, 3742, 257, 309, 3, 147, 745, 219, 752, 895, 9095, 9, 138, 4, 3, 870, 214, 32, 505, 390, 1162, 5, 336, 2011, 219, 752, 471, 303, 1700, 80, 1481, 43, 455, 2, 617, 9, 12, 9, 110, 3, 69, 2, 607, 1684]",1371.0,12818292,20
Hemithoracic radiation after extrapleural pneumonectomy for malignant pleural mesothelioma.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2003-08-01,"The treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma remains a therapeutic challenge, with median survival rates of about 12 months and local failure rates of up to 80%. Our institution recently published results showing that extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) followed by hemithoracic radiation yielded excellent local control. This paper reports our technique for high-dose hemithoracic radiation after EPP. Between 1990 and 2001, 35 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma were treated with EPP followed by hemithoracic radiation therapy (median dose: 54 Gy, range: 45-54 Gy) at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. EPP was defined as en bloc resection of the entire pleura, lung, and diaphragm with or without resection of the pericardium. The radiation therapy target volume was the entire hemithorax, including the pleural folds and the thoracotomy and chest tube incision sites. Patients were treated with a total dose of 5400 cGy delivered in 30 fractions of 180 cGy. Radiation therapy was well tolerated, and toxicity data are described. Of the 35 patients analyzed, 29 patients were male, and 18 had right-sided tumors. Twenty-six had epithelioid histologies. UICC stage was I in 4, II in 11, III in 19, and IV in 1 patient. As shown by axial and sagittal isodose distributions, we were able to deliver adequate doses to the target volume while limiting dose to critical structures such as heart, spinal cord, liver, and stomach. The most common toxicities were RTOG Grades 1 and 2 nausea and vomiting, as well as lung, esophageal, and skin toxicities. Extrapleural pneumonectomy followed by high-dose hemithoracic radiation therapy is a feasible treatment regimen that is well tolerated for patients with malignant mesothelioma. We have demonstrated adequate dose distributions, using a combined photon and electron technique with blocking of critical normal structures.",Journal Article,6017.0,107.0,The treatment of malignant pleural remains a therapeutic challenge with median survival rates of about 12 months and local failure rates of up to 80 Our institution recently published results showing that extrapleural pneumonectomy EPP followed by hemithoracic radiation yielded excellent local control This paper reports our technique for high-dose hemithoracic radiation after EPP Between 1990 and 2001 35 patients with malignant pleural were treated with EPP followed by hemithoracic radiation therapy median dose 54 Gy range 45-54 Gy at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center EPP was defined as en bloc resection of the entire pleura and diaphragm with or without resection of the pericardium The radiation therapy target volume was the entire hemithorax including the pleural folds and the thoracotomy and chest tube incision sites Patients were treated with a total dose of 5400 cGy delivered in 30 fractions of 180 cGy Radiation therapy was well tolerated and toxicity data are described Of the 35 patients analyzed 29 patients were male and 18 had right-sided tumors Twenty-six had epithelioid histologies UICC stage was I in 4 II in 11 III in 19 and IV in 1 patient As shown by axial and sagittal isodose distributions we were able to deliver adequate doses to the target volume while limiting dose to critical structures such as spinal cord and The most common toxicities were RTOG Grades 1 and 2 nausea and vomiting as well as and toxicities Extrapleural pneumonectomy followed by high-dose hemithoracic radiation therapy is a feasible treatment regimen that is well tolerated for patients with malignant We have demonstrated adequate dose distributions using a combined photon and electron technique with blocking of critical normal structures,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,"[3, 24, 1, 393, 2164, 469, 8, 189, 1745, 5, 52, 25, 151, 1, 545, 133, 53, 2, 293, 496, 151, 1, 126, 6, 493, 114, 731, 761, 983, 99, 2069, 17, 9113, 4853, 8263, 370, 20, 11964, 121, 2178, 1503, 293, 182, 26, 2817, 1198, 114, 1312, 9, 64, 61, 11964, 121, 50, 8263, 59, 2289, 2, 1758, 465, 7, 5, 393, 2164, 11, 73, 5, 8263, 370, 20, 11964, 121, 36, 52, 61, 667, 381, 184, 512, 667, 381, 28, 2563, 2783, 2784, 12, 574, 8263, 10, 395, 22, 4375, 5590, 170, 1, 3, 1797, 10280, 2, 7482, 5, 15, 187, 170, 1, 3, 21172, 3, 121, 36, 283, 433, 10, 3, 1797, 15912, 141, 3, 2164, 17740, 2, 3, 6103, 2, 1662, 2330, 7538, 633, 7, 11, 73, 5, 8, 181, 61, 1, 33353, 3071, 1623, 4, 201, 1550, 1, 3172, 3071, 121, 36, 10, 149, 421, 2, 155, 74, 32, 1027, 1, 3, 465, 7, 311, 462, 7, 11, 1045, 2, 203, 42, 1913, 1689, 57, 737, 437, 42, 3838, 3489, 8467, 82, 10, 70, 4, 39, 215, 4, 175, 316, 4, 326, 2, 478, 4, 14, 69, 22, 443, 20, 5229, 2, 15902, 8945, 4477, 21, 11, 1665, 6, 3392, 1658, 415, 6, 3, 283, 433, 369, 817, 61, 6, 740, 2414, 225, 22, 1499, 1885, 2, 3, 96, 186, 385, 11, 3931, 2276, 14, 2, 18, 1218, 2, 1966, 22, 149, 22, 2, 385, 9113, 4853, 370, 20, 64, 61, 11964, 121, 36, 16, 8, 1313, 24, 477, 17, 16, 149, 421, 9, 7, 5, 393, 21, 47, 264, 1658, 61, 4477, 75, 8, 397, 4216, 2, 4560, 1312, 5, 2521, 1, 740, 295, 2414]",1755.0,12873676,69
Phase I trial of escalating-dose irinotecan given weekly with cisplatin and concurrent radiotherapy in locally advanced esophageal cancer.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2003-08-01,"To identify the maximum-tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of weekly irinotecan combined with cisplatin and radiation in esophageal cancer. Nineteen patients with clinical stage II to III esophageal squamous cell or adenocarcinoma were treated on this phase I trial. Induction chemotherapy with weekly cisplatin 30 mg/m2 and irinotecan 65 mg/m2 was administered for four treatments during weeks 1 to 5. Radiotherapy was delivered weeks 8 to 13 in 1.8-Gy daily fractions to a dose of 50.4 Gy. Cisplatin 30 mg/m2 and escalating-dose irinotecan (40, 50, 65, and 80 mg/m2) were administered on days 1, 8, 22, and 29 of radiotherapy. DLT was defined as a 2-week delay in radiotherapy for grade 3 to 4 toxicity. Minimal toxicity was observed during chemoradiotherapy, with no grade 3 or 4 esophagitis, diarrhea, or stomatitis. DLT caused by myelosuppression was seen in two of six patients treated at the 80-mg/m2 dose level, thus irinotecan 65 mg/m2 was defined as the recommended phase II dose. Dysphagia improved or resolved after induction chemotherapy in 13 (81%) of 16 patients who reported dysphagia before therapy. Only one patient (5%) required a feeding tube. Six complete responses (32%) were observed, including four pathologic complete responses in 15 patients selected to undergo surgery (27%).

Thirty-eight patients with locoregionally advanced esophageal cancer were entered into a Phase II study between November 1996 and October 1998 at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Patients initially received two cycles of chemotherapy with paclitaxel (200 mg/m(2)), 5-fluorouracil (750 mg/m(2)/d for 5 days), and cisplatin (15 mg/m(2)/d for 5 days), followed by chemoradiotherapy, consisting of radiation (45 Gy during 5 weeks) with 5-fluorouracil (300 mg/m(2)/d during radiation) and cisplatin (15 mg/m(2)/d for 5 days). Surgical resection was performed 4-6 weeks after the completion of the chemoradiotherapy. Most patients had adenocarcinoma (n = 32; 84%). Pretreatment endoscopic ultrasonography revealed T3 tumors in 33 patients (87%) and N1 disease in 25 patients (66%). Thirty-seven patients (97%) completed the planned chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy, and 35 patients (92%) underwent surgery, with a 30-day mortality rate of 6% (2 of 35 patients). A pathologic complete response or microscopic residual carcinoma (<10% viable) was found in 25 (71%) of 35 patients and was associated with a disease-free survival rate of 72% at 3 years and 51% at 5 years.

The purpose of this study was to determine viral cytotoxicity in an esophageal cancer cell line and to determine whether EGFP expression could be used as a marker of viral infection. BE3 esophageal adenocarcinoma cells were infected with NV1066 in vitro to determine cell kill and viral replication. EGFP expression was assessed by flow cytometry. The in vivo anti-tumor activity of NV1066 was tested in subcutaneous and intraperitoneal xenograft models. EGFP expression was localized in vivo by fluorescent microscopy and fluorescent laparoscopy. NV1066 effectively replicated within and killed BE3 cells in vitro and in vivo. EGFP expression identified infected tumor cells. After NV1066 treatment in vivo, EGFP expression localized to the tumor. In an intraperitoneal tumor model, EGFP could be visualized endoscopically using a laparoscope with a fluorescent filter. NV1066 has oncolytic activity against the BE3 cell line and may be a useful therapy against esophageal cancer. EGFP expression localizes the virus and may help to identify tumor deposits in vivo.

Germline mutations in PTEN, encoding a tumor suppressor phosphatase on 10q23.3, is associated with 80% of CS and 60% of BRRS. JPS is caused by mutations in MADH4 and BMPR1A, encoding two members of the TGFB superfamily. Germline mutations in LKB1 (STK11) are associated with a subset of PJS. The number, distribution, and histologic type of polyps differ amongst these syndromes as do component cancer risks. While rare, usually asymptomatic, hamartomatous polyps are felt to be component to CS. Hamartomatous polyposis is usually prominent and symptomatic in BRRS. Polyposis, which can be quite symptomatic, is a cardinal component feature of PJS and JPS. Interestingly, glycogenic acanthosis of the esophagus is highly predictive of CS and the presence of PTEN mutation. PTEN mutation positive CS have been shown to be at increased risk of breast, thyroid, and endometrial cancer. PTEN mutation positive BRRS are at increased risk of at least breast cancer, possibly that of the thyroid as well.

Phase II trial of 96-hour paclitaxel in previously treated patients with advanced esophageal cancer.,Cancer investigation,Cancer Invest.,2003-01-01,"A 96-hour infusion schedule of paclitaxel demonstrates tolerability and antitumor activity in lung cancer and breast cancer refractory to short-duration infusion paclitaxel. Given the activity of paclitaxel in esophageal cancer, a phase II trial of 96-hour infusion paclitaxel in esophageal cancer was undertaken. Both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell histology were included. Paclitaxel was administered at 140 mg/m2 over 96 hours every 21 days. Patients who had metastatic disease to the liver and transaminases greater than two times normal value received 120 mg/m2. Response to treatment was evaluated after the first two cycles and subsequently every third cycle. Ten men and four women were entered. All were eligible for response and had stage IV disease. Thirteen patients were previously treated. All 13 received prior short-duration paclitaxel-containing chemotherapy regimens. Eleven patients had adenocarcinoma and three squamous cell cancer. Patients completed a mean of two cycles (range one to eight) prior to disease progression. No major responses were observed. Toxicity was minimal and included grade 3/4 neutropenia in 14% of patients. One patient with adenocarcinoma demonstrated stable disease for 28 weeks.

Irinotecan/cisplatin followed by 5-FU/paclitaxel/radiotherapy and surgery in esophageal cancer.,"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)","Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",2003-09-01,"Local-regional carcinoma of the esophagus is often diagnosed in advanced stages because the diagnosis is established when symptoms are severe. The prognosis of patients with local-regional carcinoma of the esophagus continues to be grim. While preoperative chemoradiotherapy increases the fraction of patients who achieve pathologic complete response, that percentage is approximately 25%. In an attempt to increase the number of patients with either no cancer in the surgical specimen or only microscopic cancer, we adopted a three-step strategy. The current study utilized up to two 6-week cycles of induction chemotherapy with irinotecan (CPT-11, Camptosar) and cisplatin as step 1. This was followed by concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy with continuous infusion fluorouracil (5-FU) and paclitaxel as step 2. Once the patients recovered from chemoradiotherapy, a preoperative evaluation was performed and surgery was attempted. All patients signed an informed consent prior to their participation on the study. A total of 43 patients were enrolled. The baseline endoscopic ultrasonography revealed that 36 patients had a T3 tumor, five patients had a T2 tumor, and two had a T1 tumor. Twenty-seven patients had node-positive cancer (N1). Thirty-nine (91%) of the 43 patients underwent surgery; all had an R0 (curative) resection. A pathologic complete response was noted in 12 of the 39 patients. In addition, 17 patients had only microscopic (< 10%) viable cancer in the specimen. Therefore, a significant pathologic response was seen in 29 (74%) of 39 taken to surgery or 29 (67%) of all 43 patients enrolled on the study.

In this phase II study, we studied the combination of docetaxel (Taxotere) and irinotecan (CPT-11, Camptosar) in patients with metastatic or recurrent esophageal cancer. Eligible patients included those with histologic or cytologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma or squamous cancer of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction who had received no previous chemotherapy for metastatic esophageal cancer. Previous chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting was allowed. Patients received irinotecan at 160 mg/m2 over 90 minutes followed by docetaxel at 60 mg/m2 intravenously over 1 hour, with chemotherapy cycles repeated every 21 days. Patients were reevaluated every two cycles. Of a planned 40 patients, 15 were enrolled, with 14 patients evaluable for toxicity and 10 evaluable for response and survival. The combination of docetaxel and irinotecan resulted in a response rate of 30%. An additional 40% achieved stable disease. The median survival was 130 days, with three patients still alive at the time of this analysis. The toxicities included 71% incidence of grade 4 hematologic toxicities, with 43% febrile neutropenia. One patient died of cecal perforation after one cycle. There was no evidence of pharmacokinetic interaction, as systemic clearance of both drugs was similar to that seen after single-agent administration.

The objectives of the current study were to assess the frequency of brain metastasis from an esophageal primary tumor, to determine correlates of survival, and to describe treatment modalities and their outcomes. Between June, 1993 and July, 2001, 1588 patients with a primary esophageal carcinoma registered at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center; of those, 27 patients (1.7%) had a diagnosis of brain metastasis. The authors collected demographic and clinical data and performed a statistical analysis. The median age at the time patients were diagnosed with brain metastasis was 62 years. Tumor histologies were adenocarcinoma in 22 patients (82%), unclassified carcinoma in 3 patients (11%), and squamous cell carcinoma in 2 patients (7%). Twenty patients (74%) experienced symptoms related to the brain metastasis. The metastases were treated with whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) alone in 15 patients (56%), and 10 patients (37%) underwent surgical resection, 4 of whom (15%) also received WBRT. Two patients (7%) underwent stereotactic radiosurgery. The median survival for the entire cohort after diagnosis of the primary tumor was 12.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.17-22.5 months), and the median survival after the diagnosis of brain metastasis was 3.8 months (95% CI, 1.1-6.5 months). The longest median survival observed after the diagnosis of brain metastasis (9.6 months) occurred in patients with a single brain lesion who underwent resection and received WBRT. There was a trend toward worse survival in patients with liver metastases and patients in recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) Class II-III versus RPA Class I (P = 0.10 for both; multivariate Cox proportional hazards model analysis). Approximately 2% of patients with esophageal carcinoma had a diagnosis of brain metastasis.

Phase I and pharmacokinetic trial of the novel taxane BMS-184476 administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion in combination with cisplatin every 21 days.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2003-11-01,"BMS-184476 is a 7-methylthiomethyl ether derivative of paclitaxel that displays potency superior to paclitaxel against tumor cells in culture and human tumor xenografts. It also inhibits the growth of paclitaxel-resistant human tumor cell lines with multidrug resistance mediated by either P-glycoprotein or mutated tubulin. Given the known synergy between taxanes and cisplatin in vitro and their clinical activity in combination, we performed a Phase I trial of BMS-184476 as a 1-h i.v. infusion followed by cisplatin every 21 days. Twenty-seven patients with a variety of solid tumors and good performance status received 116 cycles of therapy at BMS-184476 doses of 40-60 mg/m(2) together with cisplatin at 75 mg/m(2). The early observation of hypersensitivity reactions required prophylactic premedication in all patients. At the planned highest dose of BMS-184476 (60 mg/m(2)) and cisplatin (75 mg/m(2)), we observed dose-limiting toxicity in the form of neutropenia and diarrhea. Also at this level, five patients experienced grade 3 or worse nausea and vomiting. Aggressive prophylactic treatment eliminated the gastrointestinal toxicity. Mild to moderate peripheral neuropathy was infrequent, as was alopecia. Patient benefits included three partial responses in patients with mesothelioma, esophageal cancer, and head and neck cancer, and two additional minor responses. Plasma pharmacokinetic data are available for 23 patients treated at 40-60 mg/m(2). The mean maximum plasma concentrations and areas under the curves increased in a dose-related manner. The pharmacokinetics of BMS-184476 appeared independent of dose. The mean (+/- SE) values for clearance, volume of distribution at steady state, and the apparent terminal half-lives of the three dose groups during cycle 1 were 243 +/- 5 ml/min/m(2), 423 +/- 58 l/m(2), and 32.2 +/- 4.5 h, respectively.

Postoperative pulmonary complications after preoperative chemoradiation for esophageal carcinoma: correlation with pulmonary dose-volume histogram parameters.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2003-12-01,"To clarify the relationship between the percentage of lung receiving low radiation doses with concurrent chemotherapy and the occurrence of postoperative pulmonary complications in the treatment of esophageal carcinoma. From 117 patients who underwent preoperative chemoradiation for esophageal cancer at our institution between 1998 and 2002, we selected 61 patients for whom complete pulmonary dose-volume histogram (DVH) data were available and analyzed the incidence of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in this group. All patients received concurrent chemoradiation therapy, and 39 patients also received induction chemotherapy before concurrent chemoradiation. The median age was 62 years, and the median radiotherapy dose was 45 Gy. The percentage of lung volume receiving at least 10 Gy (V10), 15 Gy (V15), and 20 Gy (V20) were recorded from each pulmonary DVH. Eleven (18%) of the 61 patients had pulmonary complications, 2 of whom died after progression of pneumonia. Pulmonary complications were noted more often (35% vs. 8%, p = 0.014) when the pulmonary V10 was > or =40% vs. <40% and when the V15 was > or /=30% vs. < 30% (33% vs. 10%, p = 0.036). An apparent increase in pulmonary complication rate when V20 was > or =20% vs. <20% (32% vs. 10%, p = 0.079) was not significant. None of the other factors analyzed (surgical procedure, tumor location, use of induction chemotherapy, use of concurrent taxane-based chemoradiation, or smoking history) was associated with the occurrence of pulmonary complications. The median hospital stay was 17 days for patients who had pulmonary complications vs. 12 days for patients who did not (p = 0.08).

Combined modality therapy in esophageal cancer: the Memorial experience.,Seminars in surgical oncology,Semin Surg Oncol,2003-01-01,"Over the past 20 years in the United States, esophageal cancer has shown the most rapid rate of increase of any solid tumor malignancy. Esophageal cancer is an aggressive disease, and poor survival is achieved with surgery or chemoradiation therapy alone. Ongoing trials are investigating the use of preoperative chemoradiation followed by surgical resection. Chemoradiation employing a combination of cisplatin and a continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is the most commonly used therapy. The significant gastrointestinal toxicity of traditional cisplatin/5-FU-based regimens has prompted the evaluation of new agents in combined-modality therapy.

Cancer Res.,2003-12-01,"Despite the availability of cellular markers associated with cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair, predictive factors for pathological complete response (CR) and overall survival (OS) are few in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. This study evaluates the role of clinical and cellular markers in predicting CR and OS in patients with esophageal cancer. Patients were treated with infusional cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil combined with daily radiotherapy followed by esophagectomy. Pretreatment tumors (n = 54) were analyzed for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), bax, and bcl-2 expression by immunohistochemistry and for p53 mutations by direct DNA sequencing of exons 5-8. Clinical covariates included patients' age at enrollment; gender; Barrett's metaplasia; and tumor location, histology, and differentiation. Logistic regression and survival analyses were used to evaluate the predictors. Age ranged from 32 to 75 years; most patients were male (45 male; 9 female); and tumors were distal (47 distal; 7 mid), adenocarcinoma (41 adenocarcinomas; 13 squamous cell carcinomas), and moderately differentiated (33 moderate; 6 well; 15 poor). Female gender predicted CR (odds ratio 7.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-41). The OS was 43% at 5 years. Presence of CR (P < 0.001 log rank) and p53 mutation (P = 0.051 log rank) correlated with increased OS, whereas increased EGF-R expression predicted poor OS (P = 0.009 log rank). EGF-R remained significant when adjusted for clinical covariates. There was a trend toward increased OS related to better tumor differentiation and decreased bcl-2.

Weekly paclitaxel doses of 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, and 80 mg/m(2), given as a continuous 96-hour infusion, were administered with weekly cisplatin, 30 mg/m(2) on day 1, weeks 1 to 6, and concurrent radiation (50.4 Gy). Plasma paclitaxel steady-state levels were measured. Dose-limiting toxicity, defined as a treatment break longer than 2 weeks for toxicity, occurred in one patient in the 80-mg/m(2)/wk dose level. Major causes for any (including < or = 2 weeks) treatment breaks were mediport complications and neutropenic fever, which occurred mostly at that dose level. At a paclitaxel dose of 60 mg/m(2)/wk, myelosuppression, mostly neutropenia, was relatively mild and transient; stomatitis, esophagitis, diarrhea. and peripheral neuropathy were uncommon and usually of grade 2 or less.

Dose and volume reduction for normal lung using intensity-modulated radiotherapy for advanced-stage non-small-cell lung cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2004-03-01,"To investigate dosimetric improvements with respect to tumor-dose conformity and normal tissue sparing using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) compared with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for advanced-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Forty-one patients with Stage III-IV and recurrent NSCLC who previously underwent 3D-CRT were included. IMRT plans were designed to deliver 63 Gy to 95% of the planning target volume using nine equidistant coplanar 6-MV beams. Inverse planning was performed to minimize the volumes of normal lung, heart, esophagus, and spinal cord irradiated above their tolerance doses. Dose distributions and dosimetric indexes for the tumors and critical structures in both plans were computed and compared. Using IMRT, the median absolute reduction in the percentage of lung volume irradiated to >10 and >20 Gy was 7% and 10%, respectively. This corresponded to a decrease of >2 Gy in the total lung mean dose and of 10% in the risk of radiation pneumonitis. The volumes of the heart and esophagus irradiated to >40-50 Gy and normal thoracic tissue volume irradiated to >10-40 Gy were reduced using the IMRT plans. A marginal increase occurred in the spinal cord maximal dose and lung volume >5 Gy in the IMRT plans, which could be have resulted from the significant increase in monitor units and thus leakage dose in IMRT. IMRT planning significantly improved target coverage and reduced the volume of normal lung irradiated above low doses. The spread of low doses to normal tissues can be controlled in IMRT with appropriately selected planning parameters.

Cancer Res.,2004-03-01,"The purpose of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate the emergence of second primary malignancies and the contribution of different causes of death to the outcome of patients with locoregionally advanced head and cancer receiving primary chemoradiotherapy. We studied 324 patients with stage IV squamous cell head and neck cancer who were enrolled on five consecutive multicenter Phase II studies of concurrent chemoradiotherapy. All of the regimens included concurrent 5-fluorouracil and hydroxyurea on an alternate week schedule with radiotherapy, either alone (FHX) or with cisplatin (C-FHX) or paclitaxel (T-FHX). The cumulative incidence of second primary tumors or death from any cause was estimated using methods of competing risk analysis. Median follow-up of surviving patients was 5.2 years (2-10.6 years). The 5-year overall survival and progression-free survival of the cohort were 46% and 65%, respectively. Causes of death and median time of occurrence were as follows: disease (n = 88; 1.5 years), treatment-associated acute or late complications (n = 30; 4 months), second primary tumors (n = 18; 3.5 years), comorbidities (n = 41; 1.9 years), and unknown (n = 20; 5.1 years). Predominant causes of death from comorbidities were cardiac and respiratory illnesses. Twenty-six patients (8%) developed a second primary tumor at a median time of 2.8 years (4 months to 10 years). The cumulative incidence of second primary tumors was 5%, 7%, and 13% at 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively.

Patients with inoperable, nonmetastatic non-small-cell lung cancer receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy were randomized to one of two treatment groups. Arm 1 patients received thoracic RT (total dose, 69.6 Gy in 58 fractions of 1.2 Gy b.i.d. 5 d/wk), plus oral etoposide (50 mg b.i.d. 30 min before thoracic RT for 10 days, repeated on Day 29) and cisplatin (50 mg/m2 i.v. on Days 1, 8, 29, and 36). Arm 2 patients received the same treatment plus amifostine (500 mg i.v. 20-30 min before any treatment the first 2 days of each week).

We examined for the first time NRP-1 expression in a large variety of gastrointestinal carcinomas and precursor lesions to determine whether NRP-1 up-regulation correlated with invasive growth in this system. Protein expression and localization of NRP-1 were studied by immunolabeling and semiquantification in >300 dysplastic, invasive, and metastatic lesions of the gastrointestinal tract, and confirmation of NRP-1 protein expression was performed by Western blot analysis on pancreatic cancer cell lines. NRP-1 expression was limited within normal tissues of the gastrointestinal tract, with prominent labeling present only in endothelial cells, pancreatic islet cells, and the most apical colonic epithelium. Invasive cancer of the esophagus, gallbladder, ampulla of Vater, pancreas (endocrine and exocrine), and colon, however, all demonstrated striking NRP-1 expression. NRP-1 was also identified in precursor lesions of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, such as Barrett esophagus and colorectal adenomas. Within the spectrum of precursor lesions, a progressive increase in both intensity and area of expression was evident during histologic progression from low-grade to high-grade dysplasia. Notably, the most intense up-regulation of NRP-1 was apparent at or around the point of invasion, with focal expression of NRP-1 at levels equivalent to the invasive cancer (2- to 3-fold increase). Prominent labeling for NRP-1 was apparent in primary invasive cancers, liver metastases, and a subset of lymph node metastases, with a 2- to 3-fold increase of NRP-1 over dysplastic lesions. We conclude that increased expression of NRP-1 occurs in gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and in a subset of high-grade precursor lesions. This up-regulation appears to parallel invasive behavior and may therefore be used as a potential marker for cancer aggressiveness in this system.",Journal Article,5804.0,111.0,Neuropilin-1 NRP-1 functions as an axonal guidance molecule in the developing nervous system and recent work has identified NRP-1 up-regulation in several cancers including neuroblastomas and carcinoma We examined for the first time NRP-1 expression in a large variety of carcinomas and precursor lesions to determine whether NRP-1 up-regulation correlated with invasive growth in this system Protein expression and localization of NRP-1 were studied by immunolabeling and semiquantification in 300 dysplastic invasive and metastatic lesions of the tract and confirmation of NRP-1 protein expression was performed by Western blot analysis on cancer cell lines NRP-1 expression was limited within normal tissues of the tract with prominent labeling present only in endothelial cells islet cells and the most apical colonic epithelium Invasive cancer of the ampulla of Vater endocrine and exocrine and however all demonstrated striking NRP-1 expression NRP-1 was also identified in precursor lesions of adenocarcinomas such as Barrett and adenomas Within the spectrum of precursor lesions a progressive increase in both intensity and area of expression was evident during histologic progression from low-grade to high-grade dysplasia Notably the most intense up-regulation of NRP-1 was apparent at or around the point of invasion with focal expression of NRP-1 at levels equivalent to the invasive cancer 2- to 3-fold increase Prominent labeling for NRP-1 was apparent in primary invasive cancers metastases and a subset of lymph node metastases with a 2- to 3-fold increase of NRP-1 over dysplastic lesions We conclude that increased expression of NRP-1 occurs in adenocarcinomas and in a subset of high-grade precursor lesions This up-regulation appears to parallel invasive behavior and may therefore be used as a potential marker for cancer aggressiveness in this system,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[15253, 14, 11164, 14, 1681, 22, 35, 17257, 2753, 1354, 4, 3, 931, 1880, 398, 2, 435, 1357, 71, 108, 11164, 14, 126, 863, 4, 392, 163, 141, 8915, 2, 134, 21, 409, 9, 3, 157, 98, 11164, 14, 55, 4, 8, 375, 1362, 1, 826, 2, 2765, 406, 6, 223, 317, 11164, 14, 126, 863, 438, 5, 416, 129, 4, 26, 398, 178, 55, 2, 2145, 1, 11164, 14, 11, 656, 20, 21238, 2, 54129, 4, 2036, 6461, 416, 2, 113, 406, 1, 3, 1696, 2, 3551, 1, 11164, 14, 178, 55, 10, 173, 20, 1521, 2639, 65, 23, 12, 31, 285, 11164, 14, 55, 10, 383, 262, 295, 742, 1, 3, 1696, 5, 3689, 3383, 364, 158, 4, 845, 37, 7475, 37, 2, 3, 96, 9238, 3663, 2781, 416, 12, 1, 3, 12837, 1, 14777, 1293, 2, 12774, 2, 137, 62, 264, 5133, 11164, 14, 55, 11164, 14, 10, 120, 108, 4, 2765, 406, 1, 1586, 225, 22, 4366, 2, 2751, 262, 3, 1873, 1, 2765, 406, 8, 1014, 344, 4, 110, 837, 2, 965, 1, 55, 10, 2853, 190, 884, 91, 29, 154, 88, 6, 64, 88, 2253, 2552, 3, 96, 3933, 126, 863, 1, 11164, 14, 10, 2235, 28, 15, 3337, 3, 741, 1, 578, 5, 2137, 55, 1, 11164, 14, 28, 148, 2017, 6, 3, 416, 12, 18, 6, 27, 1116, 344, 3689, 3383, 9, 11164, 14, 10, 2235, 4, 86, 416, 163, 196, 2, 8, 697, 1, 263, 289, 196, 5, 8, 18, 6, 27, 1116, 344, 1, 11164, 14, 252, 6461, 406, 21, 2060, 17, 101, 55, 1, 11164, 14, 1780, 4, 1586, 2, 4, 8, 697, 1, 64, 88, 2765, 406, 26, 126, 863, 1233, 6, 2755, 416, 1710, 2, 68, 673, 40, 95, 22, 8, 174, 952, 9, 12, 3908, 4, 26, 398]",1872.0,15104297,310
Preoperative induction of CPT-11 and cisplatin chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy in patients with locoregional carcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction.,Cancer,Cancer,2004-06-01,"Patients with localized esophageal carcinoma often develop locoregional and distant disease recurrence. The current study investigated the outcome of a new chemotherapy combination as induction therapy before chemoradiotherapy. Forty-three patients with resectable carcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction were enrolled. Most of the tumors were endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) (EUS)T3 (84%) and (EUS)N1 (63%). The patients received < or = 2 6-week cycles of CPT-11 and cisplatin followed by chemoradiotherapy (45 grays with 5-fluorouracil and paclitaxel). Five to six weeks after chemoradiotherapy, the patients underwent staging and surgery. The feasibility, curative resection rates, overall and disease-free survival rates, rate of significant pathologic response, and patterns of disease recurrence were assessed. Of the 43 patients, 39 (91%) underwent an R0 resection. Two patients (5%) died after surgery. A pathologic complete response (pathCR) was observed in 11 (28%) of the 39 patients (or 26% of the 43 patients). In addition, 16 patients (41% of 39 patients or 37% of 43 patients) had < 10% viable tumor in the surgical specimen (pathPR). A comparison of endoscopic ultrasonograpy T and N classifications with surgical T and N classifications demonstrated significant down-staging (P < 0.01). The median survival period of all 43 patients was 22.1 months. Patients who had achieved a pathCR or pathPR had a longer median survival (25.6 months) than those who achieved less than a pathPR (18.5 months; P = 0.52). None of the clinical parameters examined were found to correlate with survival or pathologic response. CPT-11-based induction chemotherapy resulted in substantial pathCR and pathPR rates, both of which lead to a favorable survival outcome.

"S-1-induced, prolonged complete regression of lung metastasis from gastric cancer refractory to 5'-DFUR: a case report with pharmacokinetic study.",Japanese journal of clinical oncology,Jpn. J. Clin. Oncol.,2004-05-01,"S-1 is an oral fluoropyrimidine reported to be most active for gastric cancer. However, few studies have documented a complete response (CR) of lung metastasis to S-1 treatment. We describe a 66-year-old woman in whom S-1 induced complete regression of lung metastasis from gastric cancer, that had been refractory to another oral fluoropyrimidine, 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5'-DFUR). After preoperative chemotherapy with a combination of etoposide, adriamycin and cisplatin and with methotrexate plus 5-fluorouracil, the patient underwent a total gastrectomy with lower esophagectomy for advanced diffuse-type gastric cancer with invasion of the esophagus in May 1993. She received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with 5'-DFUR (600 mg/day) for 3 years. However, a solitary metastasis to the left lung was detected in November 1996 and she underwent partial resection of the left lung. Chemotherapy with 5'-DFUR was reinitiated after operation, but re-metastasis to the left lung with elevation of the serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was diagnosed in June 1999. Treatment with S-1 was started in August. S-1 was given orally in a dose of 100 mg/day for 28 consecutive days, followed by a 14-day recovery; treatment was repeated every 6 weeks. The metastatic lesion in the left lung completely regressed after two courses of S-1 and the serum CEA level returned to the normal range. The patient received a total of 10 courses of S-1. The dose of S-1 was reduced to 80 mg/day from the sixth course because of grade 2 skin rash. Pharmacokinetic studies after administration of S-1 revealed high and prolonged plasma 5-FU levels. Nearly 4 years have passed since complete regression of the lung metastasis. This may be the first report to document a prolonged complete response of lung metastasis from gastric cancer induced by single-agent chemotherapy with S-1.",Case Reports,5743.0,4.0,S-1 is an oral fluoropyrimidine reported to be most active for cancer However few studies have documented a complete response CR of metastasis to S-1 treatment We describe a 66-year-old woman in whom S-1 induced complete regression of metastasis from cancer that had been refractory to another oral fluoropyrimidine 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine 5'-DFUR After preoperative chemotherapy with a combination of etoposide adriamycin and cisplatin and with methotrexate plus 5-fluorouracil the patient underwent a total gastrectomy with lower esophagectomy for advanced diffuse-type cancer with invasion of the in May 1993 She received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with 5'-DFUR 600 mg/day for 3 years However a solitary metastasis to the left was detected in November 1996 and she underwent partial resection of the left Chemotherapy with 5'-DFUR was reinitiated after operation but re-metastasis to the left with elevation of the serum carcinoembryonic antigen CEA level was diagnosed in June 1999 Treatment with S-1 was started in August S-1 was given orally in a dose of 100 mg/day for 28 consecutive days followed by a 14-day recovery treatment was repeated every 6 weeks The metastatic lesion in the left completely regressed after two courses of S-1 and the serum CEA level returned to the normal range The patient received a total of 10 courses of S-1 The dose of S-1 was reduced to 80 mg/day from the sixth course because of grade 2 rash Pharmacokinetic studies after administration of S-1 revealed high and prolonged plasma 5-FU levels Nearly 4 years have passed since complete regression of the metastasis This may be the first report to document a prolonged complete response of metastasis from cancer induced by single-agent chemotherapy with S-1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[695, 14, 16, 35, 518, 5464, 210, 6, 40, 96, 544, 9, 12, 137, 1021, 94, 47, 1405, 8, 236, 51, 684, 1, 278, 6, 695, 14, 24, 21, 897, 8, 700, 111, 1095, 2854, 4, 953, 695, 14, 277, 236, 320, 1, 278, 29, 12, 17, 42, 85, 430, 6, 1809, 518, 5464, 7344, 6149, 33, 43651, 7344, 24729, 50, 498, 56, 5, 8, 150, 1, 1934, 7700, 2, 540, 2, 5, 2116, 349, 33, 1404, 3, 69, 208, 8, 181, 3577, 5, 280, 3617, 9, 131, 1388, 267, 12, 5, 578, 1, 3, 4, 68, 3343, 3109, 103, 573, 249, 56, 5, 7344, 24729, 2383, 81, 218, 9, 27, 60, 137, 8, 3144, 278, 6, 3, 1712, 10, 530, 4, 2868, 2648, 2, 3109, 208, 450, 170, 1, 3, 1712, 56, 5, 7344, 24729, 10, 30623, 50, 2589, 84, 1491, 278, 6, 3, 1712, 5, 3292, 1, 3, 524, 5139, 448, 3088, 301, 10, 265, 4, 1924, 2043, 24, 5, 695, 14, 10, 3461, 4, 2480, 695, 14, 10, 447, 1428, 4, 8, 61, 1, 394, 81, 218, 9, 339, 935, 162, 370, 20, 8, 213, 218, 1602, 24, 10, 2113, 454, 49, 244, 3, 113, 1180, 4, 3, 1712, 2500, 12579, 50, 100, 1993, 1, 695, 14, 2, 3, 524, 3088, 301, 5157, 6, 3, 295, 184, 3, 69, 103, 8, 181, 1, 79, 1993, 1, 695, 14, 3, 61, 1, 695, 14, 10, 405, 6, 493, 81, 218, 29, 3, 7462, 906, 408, 1, 88, 18, 1641, 1456, 94, 50, 634, 1, 695, 14, 553, 64, 2, 1069, 554, 33, 1296, 148, 1857, 39, 60, 47, 11814, 1192, 236, 320, 1, 3, 278, 26, 68, 40, 3, 157, 414, 6, 4753, 8, 1069, 236, 51, 1, 278, 29, 12, 277, 20, 226, 420, 56, 5, 695, 14]",1755.0,15231865,409
Endoscopic ultrasound after preoperative chemoradiation can help identify patients who benefit maximally after surgical esophageal resection.,The American journal of gastroenterology,Am. J. Gastroenterol.,2004-07-01,"We investigated whether differences in postoperative survival exist based on the presence and site of residual tumor (esophagus vs regional lymph nodes) after preoperative chemoXRT in patients with esophageal cancer. Based on these data, we reevaluated the role of EUS in identifying patients who maximally benefit from surgical esophageal resection after preoperative chemoXRT. We studied 97 consecutive esophageal cancer patients treated with preoperative chemoXRT and a potentially curative surgical procedure between 1998 to 2001. All patients had EUS examination prior to chemoXRT and 53 had a repeat EUS examination after chemoXRT but prior to surgery. Surgical resection specimens were analyzed for absence or presence of residual tumor and its location. Patients with residual tumor in the esophagus (pathT1-3N0) and patients without residual tumor (pathT0N0) had similar cumulative survival (p= 0.92). Patients with residual cancer in lymph nodes showed a trend toward shorter cumulative survival compared to patients without residual tumor in lymph nodes (p= 0.086). The actuarial survival in pathN1 group was lower than pathN0 group at 1, 2, and 3 yr. Patients with significant residual lymphadenopathy detected by EUS after therapy had significantly worse postoperative survival compared to patients with no residual lymphadenopathy (p= 0.028).

This retrospective study included 81 consecutive patients with resectable cancer of the esophagus who received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by esophagectomy between January 1990 and December 1998 (inclusive). Thirty-nine patients underwent chemoradiotherapy followed by esophagectomy (CHT/RT+S), 42 received additional induction CHT followed by CHT/RT+S (CHT+CHT/RT+S). Of the 81 patients, 47 were entered in institutional or national prospective trials (6 in the CHT/RT+S and 41 in the CHT+CHT/RT+S group). Induction CHT consisted of three courses of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin, and paclitaxel given in 28-day cycles in 37 patients (88.1%). Concurrent CHT was 5-FU and platinum based. The median radiation dose for patients treated with CHT/RT+S was 30 Gy (range, 30-50.4 Gy) delivered in a median of 10 fractions (range, 10-28 fractions) and 45 Gy (range, 30-45 Gy) in a median of 25 fractions (range, 10-25 fractions) for patients treated with CHT+CHT/RT+S. Esophagectomy was performed 6-8 weeks after completion of concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Most patients underwent transthoracic esophagectomy (n = 66, 82.5%). The pretreatment characteristics were well balanced between the two groups except for age. The median follow-up time was 29 months (22 months for the CHT/RT+S group and 38.5 months for the CHT+CHT/RT+S group) for all patients and 49 months for living patients. The actuarial overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), locoregional control (LRC), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) rate at 5 years for the entire group was 46%, 36.6%, 70.7%, and 53.2%, respectively. Statistically significant differences in the OS, DFS, and LRC rates between the two groups were detected. Specifically, the 5-year OS rate was 22.8% and 71.1% in the CHT/RT+S and CHT+CHT/RT+S group (p = 0.0001), respectively. The 5-year DFS rate was 27.6% and 56.6% in the CHT/RT+S and CHT+CHT/RT+S group (p = 0.003), respectively. The 5-year LRC rate was 64.2% and 85.6% in the CHT/RT+S and CHT+CHT/RT+S group (p = 0.007), respectively.

The statistically significant differences persisted when patients who received >/=45 Gy in each group were compared. Among those patients, the 5-year OS, DFS, LRC, and DMFS rates were 23.1%, 15.4%, 58.6%, and 39.2%, respectively, for those receiving CHT/RT+S, and 71.4% (p = 0.001), 55.8% (p = 0.0008), 84.6% (p = 0.005), and 77.3% (p = 0.009), respectively, for those receiving CHT+CHT/RT+S. The pathologic complete response (pCR) rate was greater in the CHT+CHT/RT+S group compared with in the CHT/RT+S group (p = 0.008). In univariate analysis, young age, good Karnofsky performance status, Stage II disease, total radiation dose, multiple drug regimen for concurrent CHT, pCR, R0 resection, distant disease progression, and CHT+CHT/RT+S treatment proved to be prognostic factors for OS. Lower esophageal/gastroesophageal junction tumor location, pCR, R0 resection, and CHT+CHT/RT+S treatment were favorable prognostic factors for LRC. Neither the total radiation dose nor multiple drugs for concurrent CHT were negative prognostic factors for LRC. In multivariate analysis, pCR, R0 resection, and treatment with CHT+CHT/RT+S were independent positive predictive factors for OS, and distant recurrences were negative predictive factors for OS. R0 resection, CHT+CHT/RT+S treatment, and lower esophageal/gastroesophageal junction tumor location were positive predictive factors for LRC. The radiation dose was not identified as an independent prognostic factor for either OS or LRC in the multivariate analysis.

Preliminary reports suggest that FDG-PET may be predictive of the response of esophageal carcinoma patients to preoperative CRT. Eighty-three patients with resectable esophageal carcinoma who underwent preoperative CRT and FDG-PET and tumor resection were evaluated for pathologic response to CRT, percent residual tumor, and survival. The majority of patients in the current study were men (74 of 83 patients; 89%).

"Utility of PET, CT, and EUS to identify pathologic responders in esophageal cancer.",The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2004-10-01,"This study evaluates the utility of positron emission tomography (PET), endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), and computed tomographic (CT) scans to predict pathologic response and survival following preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) in esophageal cancer. One hundred three sequential patients with locoregionally advanced esophageal cancer, who were treated with CRT and esophageal resection between May 2001 and November 2003 at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, were retrospectively reviewed. PET, EUS, and CT were performed before (pre) or after (post) CRT and before surgical resection. PET standardized uptake value (SUV) was defined as maximal uptake in primary tumor. Most patients were male (91 [88%]) with adenocarcinoma (90 [87%]). Pretreatment clinical stages were: IIA (42 [41%]), IIB (5 [5%]), III (50 [49%]), and IVA (6 [6%]). At the time of surgery, 58 patients (56%) had a pathologic response to CRT (< or =10% viable cells). Post-CRT measurements that correlated with pathologic response were: CT esophageal wall thickness (13.3 vs 15.3 mm, p = 0.04), EUS mass size (0.7 vs 1.7 cm, p = 0.01) and PET SUV (3.1 vs 5.8, p = 0.01). Post-CRT PET SUV equal to or greater than 4 had the highest accuracy for pathologic response (76%).

Fatty acid synthase inhibitors are chemopreventive for mammary cancer in neu-N transgenic mice.,Oncogene,Oncogene,2005-01-01,"High levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS) have been found in cancer precursor lesions of the colon, stomach, esophagus, oral cavity, prostate, and breast. Inhibition of FAS with C75 has led to a significant antitumor effect in both human breast and prostate cancer xenografts. Recently, HER2/neu, which has also been identified in preneoplastic breast lesions, has been shown to regulate FAS expression through the PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathway rendering them susceptible to FAS inhibition. Utilizing the neu-N transgenic mouse model of mammary cancer, weekly treatment of the neu-N mice with C75 (30 mg/kg) for 10 weeks significantly delayed tumor progression. Only 20% of the C75-treated transgenic mice developed mammary carcinoma by 220 days, compared to 50% in the vehicle control animals. Two C75-treated animals never developed mammary cancer. Analysis of mammary tissue following 10 weeks of C75 treatment revealed a significant delay in mammary maturation as manifested by a reduction of the number and caliber of mammary ducts and budding epithelial structures. Apoptotic changes were increased, DNA synthesis was decreased, and the expressions of FAS, neu, Akt, phospho-Akt, and p21(waf1) were all decreased when compared to vehicle controls and FVB/N mice. Importantly, these effects were restricted to the breast epithelial cells that overexpressed neu, not involving other normal duct structures in the skin, liver, or kidney. C247, an FAS inhibitor chemically distinct from C75, significantly delayed mammary maturation similar to C75. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of FAS affects the expression of key oncogenes involved in both cancer development and maintenance of the malignant phenotype. Moreover, these data identify FAS as a potential novel drug target for breast cancer chemoprevention.",Journal Article,5498.0,122.0,High levels of fatty acid synthase FAS have been found in cancer precursor lesions of the oral cavity and Inhibition of FAS with C75 has led to a significant antitumor effect in both human and cancer xenografts Recently HER2/neu which has also been identified in preneoplastic lesions has been shown to regulate FAS expression through the PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathway rendering them susceptible to FAS inhibition Utilizing the neu-N transgenic mouse model of mammary cancer weekly treatment of the neu-N mice with C75 30 mg/kg for 10 weeks significantly delayed tumor progression Only 20 of the C75-treated transgenic mice developed mammary carcinoma by 220 days compared to 50 in the vehicle control animals Two C75-treated animals never developed mammary cancer Analysis of mammary tissue following 10 weeks of C75 treatment revealed a significant delay in mammary maturation as manifested by a reduction of the number and caliber of mammary ducts and budding epithelial structures Apoptotic changes were increased DNA synthesis was decreased and the expressions of FAS neu Akt phospho-Akt and p21 waf1 were all decreased when compared to vehicle controls and FVB/N mice Importantly these effects were restricted to the epithelial cells that overexpressed neu not involving other normal duct structures in the or C247 an FAS inhibitor chemically distinct from C75 significantly delayed mammary maturation similar to C75 Thus pharmacological inhibition of FAS affects the expression of key oncogenes involved in both cancer development and maintenance of the malignant phenotype Moreover these data identify FAS as a potential novel drug target for cancer chemoprevention,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[64, 148, 1, 4038, 971, 3522, 3625, 47, 85, 204, 4, 12, 2765, 406, 1, 3, 518, 2405, 2, 297, 1, 3625, 5, 20400, 71, 836, 6, 8, 93, 579, 254, 4, 110, 171, 2, 12, 1348, 761, 354, 1637, 92, 71, 120, 85, 108, 4, 9980, 406, 71, 85, 443, 6, 2288, 3625, 55, 298, 3, 974, 649, 1235, 2761, 308, 9535, 1370, 4012, 6, 3625, 297, 2600, 3, 1637, 78, 2862, 830, 202, 1, 1903, 12, 709, 24, 1, 3, 1637, 78, 399, 5, 20400, 201, 81, 503, 9, 79, 244, 97, 1612, 30, 91, 158, 179, 1, 3, 20400, 73, 2862, 399, 276, 1903, 134, 20, 6211, 162, 72, 6, 212, 4, 3, 4974, 182, 2258, 100, 20400, 73, 2258, 1737, 276, 1903, 12, 65, 1, 1903, 246, 366, 79, 244, 1, 20400, 24, 553, 8, 93, 1984, 4, 1903, 4537, 22, 6023, 20, 8, 628, 1, 3, 207, 2, 19673, 1, 1903, 7310, 2, 14895, 701, 2414, 1631, 400, 11, 101, 261, 2525, 10, 340, 2, 3, 4249, 1, 3625, 1637, 649, 3125, 649, 2, 2657, 7858, 11, 62, 340, 198, 72, 6, 4974, 535, 2, 11953, 78, 399, 1859, 46, 176, 11, 2016, 6, 3, 701, 37, 17, 1711, 1637, 44, 1267, 127, 295, 2920, 2414, 4, 3, 15, 54412, 35, 3625, 230, 9343, 834, 29, 20400, 97, 1612, 1903, 4537, 288, 6, 20400, 631, 3419, 297, 1, 3625, 2561, 3, 55, 1, 825, 3326, 646, 4, 110, 12, 193, 2, 1146, 1, 3, 393, 1005, 1393, 46, 74, 255, 3625, 22, 8, 174, 229, 234, 283, 9, 12, 2886]",1680.0,15489885,378

Induction and concurrent chemotherapy with high-dose thoracic conformal radiation therapy in unresectable stage IIIA and IIIB non-small-cell lung cancer: a dose-escalation phase I trial.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2004-11-01,"Local control rates at conventional radiotherapy doses (60 to 66 Gy) are poor in stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Dose escalation using three-dimensional thoracic conformal radiation therapy (TCRT) is one strategy to improve local control and perhaps survival. Stage III NSCLC patients with a good performance status (PS) were treated with induction chemotherapy (carboplatin area under the curve [AUC] 5, irinotecan 100 mg/m(2), and paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) days 1 and 22) followed by concurrent chemotherapy (carboplatin AUC 2 and paclitaxel 45 mg/m(2) weekly for 7 to 8 weeks) beginning on day 43. Pre- and postchemotherapy computed tomography scans defined the initial clinical target volume (CTV(I)) and boost clinical target volume (CTV(B)), respectively. The CTV(I) received 40 to 50 Gy; the CTV(B) received escalating doses of TCRT from 78 Gy to 82, 86, and 90 Gy. The primary objective was to escalate the TCRT dose from 78 to 90 Gy or to the maximum-tolerated dose. Twenty-nine patients were enrolled (25 assessable patients; median age, 59 years; 62% male; 45% stage IIIA; 38% PS 0; and 38% > or = 5% weight loss). Induction CIP was well tolerated (with filgrastim support) and active (partial response rate, 46.2%; stable disease, 53.8%; and early progression, 0%). The TCRT dose was escalated from 78 to 90 Gy without dose-limiting toxicity. The primary acute toxicity was esophagitis (16%, all grade 3).

Predictors of acute esophagitis in patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma treated with concurrent chemotherapy and hyperfractionated radiotherapy followed by surgery.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2004-11-01,"To evaluate possible clinical and dosimetric predictors of acute esophagitis in patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma treated in a prospective Phase I-II trimodality protocol. The data from 36 patients with Stage III non-small-cell lung carcinoma treated in a Phase I-II high-dose concurrent chemoradiotherapy protocol were analyzed for possible predictors of acute esophagitis. The median age was 58 years (range, 38-77 years). Patients included in this study had either Stage IIIA (n = 24) or IIIB (n = 12) disease. All patients were treated with induction concurrent carboplatin (area under the plasma concentration-time curve 1), vinorelbine (5-15 mg/m(2)), and hyperfractionated radiotherapy (69.6 Gy) followed by consolidation chemotherapy (carboplatin area under the plasma concentration-time curve 6, vinorelbine 25 mg/m(2), docetaxel 75 mg/m(2)) or surgery (n = 19) plus consolidation chemotherapy. Acute toxicities were graded using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. The following clinical and dosimetric parameters were analyzed: age, gender, race, T stage, N stage, pretreatment body mass index, percentage of weight lost during therapy, pretherapy serum albumin, tumor location, length of esophagus in treatment field, percentage of esophagus volume treated to >40, >45, >50, >55, >60, and >65 Gy. These parameters were coded and analyzed against Grade 2 and worse esophagitis using univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Of the 36 patients, Grade 1, 2, and 3 acute esophagitis was observed in 16 (44%), 12 (33%), and 2 (5.5%) patients, respectively. Grade 4 or 5 toxicity was not observed in this patient cohort. Only the pretreatment body mass index (rho = -0.431, p = 0.004) and percentage of esophagus volume treated to >50 Gy (rho = 0.297, p = 0.040) demonstrated a statistically significant correlation with the incidence of Grade 2 or worse esophagitis on univariate analysis. These parameters retained their statistical significance on multivariate regression analysis (p = 0.029 and 0.049, respectively).

Is extended volume external beam radiation therapy covering the anastomotic site beneficial in post-esophagectomy high risk patients?,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,Radiother Oncol,2004-11-01,"To assess the impact of extended volume radiation therapy (RT) with anastomotic coverage on local control in high risk post-operative esophageal cancer patients. This is a retrospective study of high risk (T(3), T(4), nodes positive, with or without margin involvement) post-operative esophageal cancer patients treated at London Regional Cancer Centre from 1989 to 1999. After esophagectomy, all patients received adjuvant combined modality therapy consisting of four cycles of fluorouracil-based chemotherapy, and loco-regional RT with or without coverage of the anastomotic site. RT dose ranged from 45 to 60 Gy at 1.8-2.0 Gy/fraction with treatment fields tailored to the pathologic findings and location of the anastomosis. CT planning was used in all patients to design spinal cord sparing beam arrangements. First relapse rate (first incidence of an event), disease specific survival and overall survival were calculated by Chi-Square, Log-Rank, and Kaplan-Meier (K-M) methods. During the study period, 72 patients had underwent esophagectomy and were considered for adjuvant chemoradiation therapy. Three patients were excluded due to disease progression prior to therapy. The 69 remaining patients formed the study cohort for the present analysis. The median age of the study group was 60 years (range 35-82 years). Pathologic stage distribution (AJCC 1997 staging) was T(2,3) N(1) in 94% patients, 65% of the cases were adenocarcinoma and had undergone transhiatal esophagectomy (86%) with positive/close margins in 34 (49%) patients. Median follow-up was 30.5 months (range 3.4-116.3 months). Two- and 5-year actuarial overall survivals rates were 50 and 31%, respectively. First relapse rate after adjuvant therapy was 63.7% (n = 44) and median time to relapse was 27.2 months. Anastomosis recurrence rates were 29% with small volume and 0% with extended volume RT (P = 0.041). Local and regional relapse occurred in 74.2% of patients treated with small volume RT compared to 15.4% in patients treated with extended volume RT (P < 0.001). After adjusting for resection margin status, the local control benefit of extended volume RT remained significant (P = 0.003).

Tumor had to be considered technically unresectable after evaluation by our multidisciplinary head/neck tumor board. XRT was given continuous course using an accelerated regimen with twice a day fractionation for the cone down (70-72 Gy/6 weeks). Chemotherapy consisted of 2 cycles of paclitaxel via 96-hour infusion during weeks 1 and 5 of XRT. The first 10 patients received doses of 40-120 mg/m2/cycle, and the subsequent 13 patients received 100 mg/m2/cycle. Twenty-three patients were studied. Median follow-up was 20.4 months (44.4 months for the 10 long-term survivors). Most (19/23) patients had reversible grade 3 acute mucositis. Median treatment time was 44 days, and all but 1 patient received both cycles of paclitaxel at their planned dose. The 3- and 4-year actuarial survival was 37%. Three- and 4-year LRC was 50%. Four patients (18%) developed distant metastases. Two patients (9%) developed severe esophageal strictures requiring permanent gastrostomy/tracheostomy, and 2 patients developed other late grade 3+ toxicities. Accelerated XRT plus concurrent 96-hour infusional paclitaxel as given in this study has intense but acceptable toxicity and is feasible. LRC and survival compare favorably with other aggressive regimens for this poor-prognosis population. Further study of accelerated XRT with concurrent chemotherapy is indicated.",Clinical Trial,5529.0,11.0,Recent data show that accelerated radiotherapy XRT improves local-regional control LRC over standard-fractionation XRT Concurrent chemoradiotherapy improves LRC and survival over XRT alone This study assesses the feasibility toxicity and preliminary efficacy of concurrent 96-hour paclitaxel infusion with accelerated XRT Eligible patients had stage IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and exclusive of nasopharynx cancer Tumor had to be considered technically unresectable after evaluation by our multidisciplinary head/neck tumor board XRT was given continuous course using an accelerated regimen with twice a day fractionation for the cone down 70-72 Gy/6 weeks Chemotherapy consisted of 2 cycles of paclitaxel via 96-hour infusion during weeks 1 and 5 of XRT The first 10 patients received doses of 40-120 mg/m2/cycle and the subsequent 13 patients received 100 mg/m2/cycle Twenty-three patients were studied Median follow-up was 20.4 months 44.4 months for the 10 long-term survivors Most 19/23 patients had reversible grade 3 acute mucositis Median treatment time was 44 days and all but 1 patient received both cycles of paclitaxel at their planned dose The 3- and 4-year actuarial survival was 37 Three- and 4-year LRC was 50 Four patients 18 developed distant metastases Two patients 9 developed severe strictures requiring permanent gastrostomy/tracheostomy and 2 patients developed other late grade 3+ toxicities Accelerated XRT plus concurrent 96-hour infusional paclitaxel as given in this study has intense but acceptable toxicity and is feasible LRC and survival compare favorably with other aggressive regimens for this poor-prognosis population Further study of accelerated XRT with concurrent chemotherapy is indicated,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[435, 74, 514, 17, 2241, 310, 3429, 1804, 293, 951, 182, 4000, 252, 260, 3519, 3429, 750, 1464, 1804, 4000, 2, 25, 252, 3429, 279, 26, 45, 7777, 3, 1437, 155, 2, 1676, 209, 1, 750, 921, 2583, 490, 904, 5, 2241, 3429, 625, 7, 42, 82, 478, 691, 31, 134, 1, 3, 718, 2, 4804, 1, 13789, 12, 30, 42, 6, 40, 515, 6093, 1468, 50, 451, 20, 114, 1643, 718, 4606, 30, 2620, 3429, 10, 447, 1314, 906, 75, 35, 2241, 477, 5, 936, 8, 218, 3519, 9, 3, 6939, 1328, 431, 720, 381, 49, 244, 56, 1695, 1, 18, 410, 1, 490, 847, 921, 2583, 904, 190, 244, 14, 2, 33, 1, 3429, 3, 157, 79, 7, 103, 415, 1, 327, 2031, 81, 821, 417, 2, 3, 706, 233, 7, 103, 394, 81, 821, 417, 737, 169, 7, 11, 656, 52, 166, 126, 10, 179, 39, 53, 584, 39, 53, 9, 3, 79, 319, 337, 332, 96, 326, 382, 7, 42, 2786, 88, 27, 286, 2606, 52, 24, 98, 10, 584, 162, 2, 62, 84, 14, 69, 103, 110, 410, 1, 490, 28, 136, 1465, 61, 3, 27, 2, 39, 111, 2361, 25, 10, 567, 169, 2, 39, 111, 4000, 10, 212, 294, 7, 203, 276, 626, 196, 100, 7, 83, 276, 905, 7860, 1888, 4377, 6983, 15648, 2, 18, 7, 276, 127, 807, 88, 27, 385, 2241, 3429, 349, 750, 921, 2583, 4825, 490, 22, 447, 4, 26, 45, 71, 3933, 84, 1595, 155, 2, 16, 1313, 4000, 2, 25, 932, 5001, 5, 127, 571, 472, 9, 26, 334, 356, 266, 195, 45, 1, 2241, 3429, 5, 750, 56, 16, 1103]",1739.0,15577438,661
Esophagectomy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy improves locoregional control in clinical stage II or III esophageal cancer patients.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2004-12-01,"To evaluate the effect of surgical resection on the outcome of patients with clinical Stage II or III cancer of the esophagus treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. A retrospective review of 132 consecutive patients with clinical Stage II or III esophageal cancer treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy between January 1990 and December 1998 was performed. Of the 132 patients, 60 underwent esophagectomy 6-8 weeks after chemoradiotherapy. The median radiation dose was 50 Gy (range, 30-64.8 Gy) in the definitive chemoradiation group and 45 Gy (range, 30-50.4 Gy) in the chemoradiation plus esophagectomy group. Statistically significant differences were found between the two groups in median age, histologic subtype, tumor location, and number of patients with T4 disease. Patients who underwent definitive chemoradiotherapy were older (p = 0.0004) and more likely to have squamous cell carcinoma than adenocarcinoma (p <0.000), upper thoracic or cervical esophageal tumors (p <0.000), and T4 tumors (p = 0.024). Patients treated with chemoradiation plus esophagectomy had statistically significant superior 5-year loco-regional control (67.1% vs. 22.1%, p <0.000), disease-free survival (40.7% vs. 9.9%, p < 0.000), and 5-year overall survival (52.6% vs. 6.5%, p < 0.000) rates and median survival time (62 vs. 12 months) compared with patients treated with chemoradiotherapy only. However, no statistically significant difference was found in the rate of distant metastasis-free survival between the two groups (67.5% vs. 65.8%, p = 0.3). Surgical resection of the tumor was an independent predictor of improved locoregional control and overall survival in both univariate and multivariate analyses. To reduce the effect of the selection bias on the outcome, 34 patients in each group with matched pretreatment characteristics were compared. The results showed statistically significant better overall survival, disease-free survival, and locoregional control in favor of the chemoradiotherapy plus esophagectomy group. No statistically significant difference in distant metastasis-free survival was found in this subgroup analysis. Locoregional control was better in clinical Stage II or III esophageal cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiation plus esophagectomy. An improvement in survival occurred in the chemoradiation plus esophagectomy group, although this observation may have reflected selection bias. The results from this study suggest the need for a randomized trial to compare chemoradiation with or without esophagectomy in the treatment of cancer of the esophagus.",Journal Article,5529.0,38.0,To evaluate the effect of surgical resection on the outcome of patients with clinical Stage II or III cancer of the treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy A retrospective review of 132 consecutive patients with clinical Stage II or III cancer treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy between January 1990 and December 1998 was performed Of the 132 patients 60 underwent esophagectomy 6-8 weeks after chemoradiotherapy The median radiation dose was 50 Gy range 30-64.8 Gy in the definitive chemoradiation group and 45 Gy range 30-50.4 Gy in the chemoradiation plus esophagectomy group Statistically significant differences were found between the two groups in median age histologic subtype tumor location and number of patients with T4 disease Patients who underwent definitive chemoradiotherapy were older p 0.0004 and more likely to have squamous cell carcinoma than adenocarcinoma p 0.000 upper thoracic or tumors p 0.000 and T4 tumors p 0.024 Patients treated with chemoradiation plus esophagectomy had statistically significant superior 5-year loco-regional control 67.1 vs. 22.1 p 0.000 disease-free survival 40.7 vs. 9.9 p 0.000 and 5-year overall survival 52.6 vs. 6.5 p 0.000 rates and median survival time 62 vs. 12 months compared with patients treated with chemoradiotherapy only However no statistically significant difference was found in the rate of distant metastasis-free survival between the two groups 67.5 vs. 65.8 p 0.3 Surgical resection of the tumor was an independent predictor of improved locoregional control and overall survival in both univariate and multivariate analyses To reduce the effect of the selection bias on the outcome 34 patients in each group with matched pretreatment characteristics were compared The results showed statistically significant better overall survival disease-free survival and locoregional control in favor of the chemoradiotherapy plus esophagectomy group No statistically significant difference in distant metastasis-free survival was found in this subgroup analysis Locoregional control was better in clinical Stage II or III cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiation plus esophagectomy An improvement in survival occurred in the chemoradiation plus esophagectomy group although this observation may have reflected selection bias The results from this study suggest the need for a randomized trial to compare chemoradiation with or without esophagectomy in the treatment of cancer of the,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,"[6, 376, 3, 254, 1, 221, 170, 23, 3, 228, 1, 7, 5, 38, 82, 215, 15, 316, 12, 1, 3, 73, 5, 750, 1464, 8, 459, 206, 1, 4255, 935, 7, 5, 38, 82, 215, 15, 316, 12, 73, 5, 750, 1464, 59, 1024, 2289, 2, 1397, 1850, 10, 173, 1, 3, 4255, 7, 335, 208, 3617, 49, 66, 244, 50, 1464, 3, 52, 121, 61, 10, 212, 381, 184, 201, 660, 66, 381, 4, 3, 1057, 975, 87, 2, 512, 381, 184, 201, 212, 39, 381, 4, 3, 975, 349, 3617, 87, 712, 93, 362, 11, 204, 59, 3, 100, 271, 4, 52, 89, 884, 875, 30, 1147, 2, 207, 1, 7, 5, 2463, 34, 7, 54, 208, 1057, 1464, 11, 434, 19, 13, 5295, 2, 80, 322, 6, 47, 691, 31, 134, 76, 449, 19, 13, 984, 1726, 2098, 15, 57, 19, 13, 984, 2, 2463, 57, 19, 13, 4247, 7, 73, 5, 975, 349, 3617, 42, 712, 93, 1123, 33, 111, 7214, 951, 182, 598, 14, 105, 350, 14, 19, 13, 984, 34, 115, 25, 327, 67, 105, 83, 83, 19, 13, 984, 2, 33, 111, 63, 25, 653, 49, 105, 49, 33, 19, 13, 984, 151, 2, 52, 25, 98, 744, 105, 133, 53, 72, 5, 7, 73, 5, 1464, 158, 137, 77, 712, 93, 523, 10, 204, 4, 3, 116, 1, 626, 278, 115, 25, 59, 3, 100, 271, 598, 33, 105, 556, 66, 19, 13, 27, 221, 170, 1, 3, 30, 10, 35, 306, 980, 1, 231, 1325, 182, 2, 63, 25, 4, 110, 880, 2, 331, 318, 6, 969, 3, 254, 1, 3, 881, 2947, 23, 3, 228, 562, 7, 4, 296, 87, 5, 655, 1194, 374, 11, 72, 3, 99, 224, 712, 93, 380, 63, 25, 34, 115, 25, 2, 1325, 182, 4, 4283, 1, 3, 1464, 349, 3617, 87, 77, 712, 93, 523, 4, 626, 278, 115, 25, 10, 204, 4, 26, 1363, 65, 1325, 182, 10, 380, 4, 38, 82, 215, 15, 316, 12, 7, 73, 5, 750, 975, 349, 3617, 35, 767, 4, 25, 489, 4, 3, 975, 349, 3617, 87, 242, 26, 1664, 68, 47, 4686, 881, 2947, 3, 99, 29, 26, 45, 309, 3, 594, 9, 8, 384, 160, 6, 932, 975, 5, 15, 187, 3617, 4, 3, 24, 1, 12, 1, 3]",2465.0,15590179,695
Increased 5-lipoxygenase expression and induction of apoptosis by its inhibitors in esophageal cancer: a potential target for prevention.,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,2005-01-20,"Arachidonic acid (AA) is the major precursor of several classes of signal molecules and the alteration of its metabolism is involved in human carcinogenesis. For instance, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) converts AA to hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids or leukotrienes (LTs), which are able to enhance proliferation, increase survival and suppress the apoptosis of human cells. To determine the potential use of 5-LOX inhibitors in the prevention of esophageal cancer, we first analyzed the 5-LOX expression in esophageal tissue samples using immunohistochemistry and then examined the effect of the 5-LOX inhibitors AA861 and REV5901 on cell viability and apoptosis in esophageal cancer cell lines. 5-LOX expression was present in 79% (127/161) of esophageal cancer but in only 13% (4/32) of normal esophageal mucosa. 5-LOX was also expressed in all the eight esophageal cancer cell lines. Moreover, 5-LOX inhibitors caused a dose- and time-dependent reduction of cell viability, which was due to the induction of apoptosis and associated with LTB4 suppression. Our data also showed that both LTB4, a product of 5-LOX and LTB4 receptor antagonist U-75302 were able to prevent AA861 and REV5901 on induction of apoptosis. The present study demonstrated that 5-LOX protein expression is increased in esophageal cancer and that 5-LOX inhibitors can induce esophageal cancer cells to undergo apoptosis, suggesting that 5-LOX may be an effective target in the prevention of esophageal cancer.",Comparative Study,5479.0,94.0,Arachidonic acid AA is the major precursor of several classes of signal molecules and the alteration of its metabolism is involved in human carcinogenesis For instance 5-lipoxygenase 5-LOX converts AA to hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids or leukotrienes LTs which are able to enhance proliferation increase survival and suppress the apoptosis of human cells To determine the potential use of 5-LOX inhibitors in the prevention of cancer we first analyzed the 5-LOX expression in tissue samples using immunohistochemistry and then examined the effect of the 5-LOX inhibitors AA861 and REV5901 on cell viability and apoptosis in cancer cell lines 5-LOX expression was present in 79 127/161 of cancer but in only 13 4/32 of normal mucosa 5-LOX was also expressed in all the eight cancer cell lines Moreover 5-LOX inhibitors caused a dose- and time-dependent reduction of cell viability which was due to the induction of apoptosis and associated with LTB4 suppression Our data also showed that both LTB4 a product of 5-LOX and LTB4 receptor antagonist U-75302 were able to prevent AA861 and REV5901 on induction of apoptosis The present study demonstrated that 5-LOX protein expression is increased in cancer and that 5-LOX inhibitors can induce cancer cells to undergo apoptosis suggesting that 5-LOX may be an effective target in the prevention of cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[14745, 971, 1519, 16, 3, 458, 2765, 1, 392, 3211, 1, 1235, 1598, 2, 3, 2611, 1, 211, 1600, 16, 646, 4, 171, 1719, 9, 10642, 33, 12705, 33, 4577, 13238, 1519, 6, 28023, 4562, 15, 28022, 8687, 92, 32, 1665, 6, 1304, 457, 344, 25, 2, 3134, 3, 351, 1, 171, 37, 6, 223, 3, 174, 119, 1, 33, 4577, 222, 4, 3, 1070, 1, 12, 21, 157, 311, 3, 33, 4577, 55, 4, 246, 347, 75, 888, 2, 818, 409, 3, 254, 1, 3, 33, 4577, 222, 43839, 2, 43840, 23, 31, 2120, 2, 351, 4, 12, 31, 285, 33, 4577, 55, 10, 364, 4, 842, 4080, 5377, 1, 12, 84, 4, 158, 233, 39, 531, 1, 295, 2713, 33, 4577, 10, 120, 570, 4, 62, 3, 659, 12, 31, 285, 1393, 33, 4577, 222, 1546, 8, 61, 2, 98, 470, 628, 1, 31, 2120, 92, 10, 520, 6, 3, 504, 1, 351, 2, 41, 5, 26361, 1332, 114, 74, 120, 224, 17, 110, 26361, 8, 2821, 1, 33, 4577, 2, 26361, 153, 3137, 1767, 54574, 11, 1665, 6, 1682, 43839, 2, 43840, 23, 504, 1, 351, 3, 364, 45, 264, 17, 33, 4577, 178, 55, 16, 101, 4, 12, 2, 17, 33, 4577, 222, 122, 1290, 12, 37, 6, 1251, 351, 802, 17, 33, 4577, 68, 40, 35, 323, 283, 4, 3, 1070, 1, 12]",1348.0,15661803,121
Flavopiridol reduces malignant transformation of the esophageal mucosa in p27 knockout mice.,Oncogene,Oncogene,2005-03-01,"The cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor p27 preferentially inactivates cdk complexes required for progression through the G1/S transition. Loss of p27 is associated with aggressive behavior in a variety of tumors, including Barrett's associated adenocarcinoma (BAA). We have previously shown that gastroduodenal-esophageal reflux (GDER) together with N-methyl-N-benzylnitrosamine (MBN) induces Barrett's esophagus (BE) and malignant transformation of the esophageal mucosa in mice. This process is enhanced in a p27 null background. Here, we show that chronic flavopiridol administration sharply reduced the prevalence of BE in GDER/MBN-treated p27 knockout mice when compared to animals treated with diluent only (7 vs 26%, P=0.0079).

Canadian Consensus Conference on the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in adults - update 2004.,Canadian journal of gastroenterology = Journal canadien de gastroenterologie,Can. J. Gastroenterol.,2005-01-01,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the most prevalent acid-related disorder in Canada and is associated with significant impairment of health-related quality of life. Since the last Canadian Consensus Conference in 1996, GERD management has evolved substantially. To develop up-to-date evidence-based recommendations relevant to the needs of Canadian health care providers for the management of the esophageal manifestations of GERD. A multidisciplinary group of 23 voting participants developed recommendation statements using a Delphi approach; after presentation of relevant data at the meeting, the quality of the evidence, strength of recommendation and level of consensus were graded by participants according to accepted principles. GERD applies to individuals who reflux gastric contents into the esophagus causing symptoms sufficient to reduce quality of life, injury or both; endoscopy-negative reflux disease applies to individuals who have GERD and a normal endoscopy. Uninvestigated heartburn-dominant dyspepsia - characterised by heartburn or acid regurgitation - includes erosive esophagitis or endoscopy-negative reflux disease, and may be treated empirically as GERD without further investigation provided there are no alarm features. Lifestyle modifications are ineffective for frequent or severe GERD symptoms; over-the-counter antacids or histamine H2-receptor antagonists are effective for some patients with mild or infrequent GERD symptoms. Proton pump inhibitors are more effective for healing and symptom relief than histamine H2-receptor antagonists; their efficacy is proportional to their ability to reduce intragastric acidity. Response to initial therapy - a once-daily proton pump inhibitor unless symptoms are mild and infrequent (fewer than three times per week) - should be assessed at four to eight weeks. Maintenance medical therapy should be at the lowest dose and frequency necessary to maintain symptom relief; antireflux surgery is an alternative for a small proportion of selected patients. Routine testing for Helicobacter pylori infection is unnecessary before starting GERD therapy. GERD is associated with Barrett's epithelium and esophageal adenocarcinoma but the risk of malignancy is very low. Endoscopic screening for Barrett's epithelium may be considered in adults with GERD symptoms for more than 10 years; Barrett's epithelium and low-grade dysplasia generally warrant surveillance; endoscopic or surgical management should be considered for confirmed high-grade dysplasia or malignancy. Prospective studies are needed to investigate clinically relevant risk factors for the development of GERD and its complications; GERD progression, on and off therapy; optimal management strategies for typical GERD symptoms in primary care patients; and optimal management strategies for atypical GERD symptoms, Barrett's epithelium and esophageal adenocarcinoma.",Consensus Development

Phase II trial of weekly irinotecan/cisplatin in advanced esophageal cancer.,"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)","Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",2004-12-01,"Esophageal cancer is a rare but highly virulent malignancy in the United States, and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus has had the most rapid rate of increase of any solid tumor malignancy. Systemic metastatic disease is present in 50% of patients at diagnosis. In the remaining 50% presenting with local regional disease, systemic metastatic disease will develop in the vast majority of these patients. The limited efficacy and toxicity of conventional fluorouracil (5-FU)/cisplatin-based chemotherapy has prompted the evaluation of newer agents. Irinotecan (Camptosar) has shown promising single-agent activity in a number of gastrointestinal cancers, including colorectal, pancreatic, and esophagogastric cancer. The phase II evaluation of the combination of weekly irinotecan and cisplatin has shown encouraging response rates exceeding 30% to 50% in esophageal and gastric cancer. Hematologic toxicity using a schedule of 4 consecutive weeks of therapy followed by 2 weeks of rest prompted interest in a multicenter trial evaluation of a change in therapy delivery to 2 weeks on and 1 week off. Cisplatin at 30 mg/m2 was administered with irinotecan at 65 mg/m2, days 1 and 8, on an every-21-day schedule. Thirty-nine patients were entered on study, with 36 evaluable for toxicity and 31 evaluable for response. Grade 3/4 neutropenia was observed in only 22% of patients, reduced from 49% in a prior phase II trial employing 4 consecutive weeks of therapy. Confirmed major responses were observed in 36% of patients (10 of 28).

Concurrent RT with 5-FU/epirubicin and cisplatin or irinotecan for locally advanced upper GI adenocarcinoma.,"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)","Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",2004-12-01,"From the results of recent studies, it is likely that multimodality therapy with chemotherapy and radiation treatment may improve the overall outcome of locally advanced upper gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, including esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, and biliary tract carcinomas. However, more effective, more optimal, and less toxic chemotherapy regimen(s) with concomitant radiotherapy are needed beyond the concurrent continuous-infusion fluorouracil (5-FU) with radiation that is commonly applied in general practice. Epirubicin (Ellence), cisplatin, and irinotecan (Camptosar) are all active cytotoxic chemotherapy agents in upper GI cancers.

Dose-response relationship in locoregional control for patients with stage II-III esophageal cancer treated with concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2005-03-01,"To evaluate the correlation between radiation dose and locoregional control (LRC) for patients with Stage II-III unresectable esophageal cancer treated with concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The medical records of 69 consecutive patients with clinical Stage II or III esophageal cancer treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1990 and 1998 were retrospectively reviewed. Of the 69 patients, 43 had received < or =51 Gy (lower dose group) and 26 >51 Gy (higher dose group). The median dose in the lower and higher dose groups was 30 Gy (range, 30-51 Gy) and 59.4 Gy (range, 54-64.8 Gy), respectively. Two fractionation schedules were used: rapid fractionation, delivering 30 Gy at 3 Gy/fraction within 2 weeks, and standard fractionation, delivering > or =45 Gy at 1.8-2 Gy/fraction daily. Total doses of <50 Gy were usually given with rapid fractionation. Cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil were administrated to 93% of the patients. The patient characteristic that differed between the two groups was that patients in the lower dose group were more likely to have had weight loss >5% (46.2% vs. 23.3%). The lower dose group had more N1 tumors, but the tumor classification and stage grouping were similar in the two groups. The median follow-up time for all patients was 22 months (range, 2-56 months). Patients in the higher dose group had a statistically significant better 3-year local control rate (36% vs. 19%, p = 0.011), disease-free survival rate (25% vs. 10%, p = 0.004), and overall survival rate (13% vs. 3%, p = 0.054). A trend toward a better distant-metastasis-free survival rate was noted in the higher dose group (72% vs. 59%, p = 0.12). The complete clinical response rate was significantly greater in the higher dose group (46% vs. 23%, p = 0.048). In both groups, the most common type of first failure was persistence of the primary tumor. Significantly fewer patients in the higher dose group had tumor persistence after treatment (p = 0.02). No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups in the pattern of locoregional or distant failure. The long-term side effects of chemoradiotherapy were similar in the two groups, although it was difficult to assess the side effects accurately in a retrospective fashion. On multivariate analysis, Stage II (vs. III) disease and radiation dose >51 Gy were independent predictors of improved LRC, and locoregional failure was an independent predictor of worse overall survival. Our data suggested a positive correlation between radiation dose and LRC in the population studied. A higher radiation dose was associated with increased LRC and survival in the dose range studied. The data also suggested that better LRC was associated with a lower rate of distant metastasis. A threshold of tumor response to radiation dose might be present, as suggested by the flattened slope in the high-dose area on the dose-response curve. A carefully designed dose-escalation study is required to confirm this assumption.",Journal Article,5439.0,72.0,To evaluate the correlation between radiation dose and locoregional control LRC for patients with Stage II-III unresectable cancer treated with concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy The medical records of 69 consecutive patients with clinical Stage II or III cancer treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy at the University of Texas M.

Posttherapy pathologic stage predicts survival in patients with esophageal carcinoma receiving preoperative chemoradiation.,Cancer,Cancer,2005-04-01,"In patients with locoregional carcinoma of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction who underwent preoperative chemoradiation, it is unclear whether survival was better predicted by pretherapy clinical stage or by posttherapy pathologic stage. The authors studied 235 consecutive patients with pretherapy clinical Stage II, III, or IVA (according to American Joint Committee on Cancer criteria) carcinoma of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction who were treated with chemoradiation followed by esophagectomy. Posttherapy cancer status was classified using pathologic stage and semiquantitative assessment of residual carcinoma. Clinicopathologic features, residual carcinoma status, and pretherapy and posttherapy stage were compared with disease-free and overall survival. Posttherapy pathologic stage was Stage 0 in 29% of patients, Stage I in 11% of patients, Stage II in 34% of patients, Stage III in 20% of patients, and Stage IV in 6% of patients. Cancer downstaging occurred in 56% of patients. In univariate analysis, disease-free and overall survival were predicted by posttherapy pathologic stage (both with P < 0.001), margin status (P = 0.002 and P = 0.01, respectively), extent of residual carcinoma (both with P < 0.001), and downstaging (both with P = 0.001), but not by age, gender, type of cancer, pretherapy clinical stage, or preoperative regimen. However, in multivariate analysis, disease-free and overall survival were independently predicted by posttherapy pathologic stage (both with P = 0.02).

Selective dose escalation of chemoradiotherapy for esophageal cancer: role of treatment intensification.,Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2004-12-01,"This ongoing phase II study is designed to assess the outcomes (survival and failure patterns) of therapy for localized esophageal cancer with conventional dose radiation (50.4 Gy) with concurrent continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel. Patients with less than complete response or partial response received dose escalation of radiation to 59.4 Gy with the same chemotherapy. This report details the results of the first 18 patients treated. From July 2000 to June 2003, we prospectively enrolled 18 patients with T1-4, N0-1, M0-1a esophageal carcinoma to receive paclitaxel 45 mg/m 2 intravenously over 1 hour and carboplatin AUC 2 intravenously over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. 5-Fluorouracil 225 mg/m2 was delivered as a continuous infusion on days 1 through 38. Radiation therapy was given 1.8 Gy x 5 days/week x 5.5 weeks (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions). After 6 to 8 weeks, patients underwent repeat staging with computed tomography scan, endoscopic ultrasound, and biopsy. Patients with a positive biopsy, or less than partial response by computed tomography and endoscopic ultrasound, received a boost of 9 Gy with the same concurrent chemotherapy. Patients were followed every 4 months with computed tomography/endoscopic ultrasound the first year and every 6 months thereafter. Median follow-up was 19 months. Eleven of 18 patients (61.1%) attained a complete response/partial response; six of 18 (33.3%) received a boost. Overall survival was 30% at 3 years, with a median of 25 months. Patients with less than 10% pretreatment weight loss had an overall survival of 36% with a median of 26 months. In patients with more than 10% pretreatment weight loss, median survival was 14 months with 0% surviving at 2 years. Local/regional control was 67% (no-boost patients [78%]; boost patients [40%]). Progression-free survival was 31% at 3 years, with a median of 14 months. Distant metastasis-free survival was 40% at 3 years, with a median of 27 months. Seventy-nine percent of patients required at least one dose reduction in chemotherapy because of toxicities. Radiation delays ranged from 0 to 62 days, with a median of 7 days. Grade 2/3 acute esophagitis was experienced by 89% and 39% of patients, respectively; 28% of patients developed esophageal strictures requiring dilatations. The combination of continuous-infusion 5-FU and weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel with selective radiation dose escalation yields promising results without surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy.

Prognostic factors in the nonsurgical treatment of esophageal carcinoma with radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy: the importance of pretreatment hemoglobin levels.,Cancer,Cancer,2005-04-01,"The current study was performed to evaluate prognostic factors for overall survival (OS), distant metastasis (DM), and local failure (LF) in patients with Stage II/III esophageal carcinoma. The following potential prognostic factors were retrospectively investigated in 124 patients treated with radiotherapy (RT) alone or with radiochemotherapy: age, gender, performance status, tumor location, tumor length, histology, histologic grade, T classification, N classification, International Union Against Cancer stage, chemotherapy, RT dose, and pre-RT hemoglobin level. Using univariate analysis (Kaplan-Meier method), pre-RT hemoglobin level, RT dose, tumor length, chemotherapy, and performance status were significantly associated with OS. Hemoglobin levels of 12.1-14.0 g/dL were associated with the best OS, followed by >/= 14.1 g/dL and </= 12.0 g/dL. DM was significantly influenced by tumor length, RT dose, N classification, and performance status. LF was significantly influenced by pre-RT hemoglobin level, RT dose, and tumor length. Using multivariate analysis (Cox proportional hazard model), pre-RT hemoglobin maintained significance for OS (P < 0.001) and LF (P < 0.001), RT dose for OS (P = 0.001), DM (P = 0.031), and LF (P < 0.001), tumor length for OS (P = 0.003), DM (P = 0.017), and LF (P = 0.033), and chemotherapy for OS (P = 0.027). N classification was of borderline significance for DM (P = 0.054). Performance status lost significance for OS (P = 0.73) and LF (P = 0.22). The strongest predictors for outcome in Stage II/III esophageal carcinoma were RT dose, tumor length, pre-RT hemoglobin level, and chemotherapy. The pre-RT hemoglobin level was an independent prognostic factor significantly associated with OS and LF.

An orthotopic model of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma in athymic nude mice.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2005-03-01,"To develop an orthotopic model of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) in athymic nude mice. Various thyroid carcinoma cell lines were injected into the thyroid gland of athymic nude mice to determine whether such injection was technically feasible. ATC cells were then injected into the thyroid gland or the subcutis of nude mice at various concentrations, and the mice were then followed for tumor development. The tumors were examined histopathologically for local invasion or regional or distant metastasis. Injection of tumor cells into the thyroid glands of nude mice was technically feasible and resulted in the formation of thyroid tumors. The ATC cell line DRO showed significantly higher tumorigenicity in the thyroid gland than in the subcutis. In contrast, oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line TU167 shows no significantly higher tumorigenicity in the thyroid gland than in the subcutis. ATC tumors established in the thyroid gland also produced symptomatic compression of the esophagus and the trachea. Local invasion of the larynx and trachea was as well as high rates of pulmonary metastasis were also observed.

Toxicities were graded by the National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria and recorded as maximum grade per patient for each treatment cycle. Inhibition of farnesyl transferase activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was evaluated. Accumulation of unfarnesylated HDJ-2 in PBMCs of patients was evaluated as a marker of farnesyl transferase inhibition by BMS-214662. Thirty patients received 141 cycles of treatment through six dose levels. Dose-limiting toxicities were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, and vomiting. There was no pharmacokinetic interaction between BMS-214662 and paclitaxel.

Some adenocarcinomas have mixed patterns, including signet-ring cell and mucinous histology, but the clinical significance of these subtypes is unknown. We studied 412 consecutive patients with esophageal or EGJ adenocarcinoma treated with chemoradiation followed by esophagectomy (193 patients) or surgery alone (219 patients). We evaluated signet-ring cell and mucinous histology in the resection and pretherapy biopsy specimens and compared clinicopathologic features with overall survival. The fraction of signet-ring cell and mucinous histology was similar in evaluated specimens of patients treated with preoperative chemoradiation or surgery alone (17% and 18%, respectively). The overall survival rate at 5 years of patients treated with preoperative chemoradiation was significantly better if residual signet-ring cell or mucinous histology was present in the esophagectomy specimen (63% versus 28%; P = 0.02).

Progression of Barrett's metaplasia to adenocarcinoma is associated with the suppression of the transcriptional programs of epidermal differentiation.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2005-04-01,"We did expressional profiling on 24 paired samples of normal esophageal epithelium, Barrett's metaplasia, and esophageal adenocarcinomas. Matching tissue samples representing the three different histologic types were obtained from each patient undergoing esophagectomy for adenocarcinoma. Our analysis compared the molecular changes accompanying the transformation of normal squamous epithelium with Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma in individual patients rather than in a random cohort. We tested the hypothesis that expressional profiling may reveal gene sets that can be used as molecular markers of progression from normal esophageal epithelium to Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma. Expressional profiling was done using U133A GeneChip (Affymetrix), which represent approximately two thirds of the human genome. The final selection of 214 genes permitted the discrimination of differential gene expression of normal esophageal squamous epithelium, Barrett's esophagus, and adenocarcinoma using two-dimensional hierarchical clustering of selected genes. These data indicate that transformation of Barrett's esophagus to adenocarcinoma is associated with suppression of the genes involved in epidermal differentiation, including genes in 1q21 loci and corresponding to the epidermal differentiation complex. Correlation analysis of genes concordantly expressed in Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma revealed 21 genes that represent potential genetic markers of disease progression and pharmacologic targets for treatment intervention.

Progress and promise of FDG-PET imaging for cancer patient management and oncologic drug development.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2005-04-01,"2-[(18)F]Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) assesses a fundamental property of neoplasia, the Warburg effect. This molecular imaging technique offers a complementary approach to anatomic imaging that is more sensitive and specific in certain cancers. FDG-PET has been widely applied in oncology primarily as a staging and restaging tool that can guide patient care. However, because it accurately detects recurrent or residual disease, FDG-PET also has significant potential for assessing therapy response. In this regard, it can improve patient management by identifying responders early, before tumor size is reduced; nonresponders could discontinue futile therapy. Moreover, a reduction in the FDG-PET signal within days or weeks of initiating therapy (e.g., in lymphoma, non-small cell lung, and esophageal cancer) significantly correlates with prolonged survival and other clinical end points now used in drug approvals. These findings suggest that FDG-PET could facilitate drug development as an early surrogate of clinical benefit. This article reviews the scientific basis of FDG-PET and its development and application as a valuable oncology imaging tool. Its potential to facilitate drug development in seven oncologic settings (lung, lymphoma, breast, prostate, sarcoma, colorectal, and ovary) is addressed. Recommendations include initial validation against approved therapies, retrospective analyses to define the magnitude of change indicative of response, further prospective validation as a surrogate of clinical benefit, and application as a phase II/III trial end point to accelerate evaluation and approval of novel regimens and therapies.",Journal Article,5408.0,436.0,2- 18 F Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography FDG-PET assesses a fundamental property of neoplasia the Warburg effect This molecular imaging technique offers a complementary approach to anatomic imaging that is more sensitive and specific in certain cancers FDG-PET has been widely applied in oncology primarily as a staging and restaging tool that can guide patient care However because it accurately detects recurrent or residual disease FDG-PET also has significant potential for assessing therapy response In this regard it can improve patient management by identifying responders early before tumor size is reduced nonresponders could discontinue futile therapy Moreover a reduction in the FDG-PET signal within days or weeks of initiating therapy e.g. in cell and cancer significantly correlates with prolonged survival and other clinical end points now used in drug approvals These findings suggest that FDG-PET could facilitate drug development as an early surrogate of clinical benefit This article reviews the scientific basis of FDG-PET and its development and application as a valuable oncology imaging tool Its potential to facilitate drug development in seven oncologic settings and ovary is addressed Recommendations include initial validation against approved therapies retrospective analyses to define the magnitude of change indicative of response further prospective validation as a surrogate of clinical benefit and application as a phase II/III trial end point to accelerate evaluation and approval of novel regimens and therapies,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[18, 203, 1068, 6231, 18, 15092, 1900, 1799, 872, 1285, 495, 7777, 8, 4595, 9267, 1, 2298, 3, 13126, 254, 26, 219, 270, 1312, 2339, 8, 3380, 353, 6, 2745, 270, 17, 16, 80, 745, 2, 112, 4, 1840, 163, 1285, 495, 71, 85, 1792, 1498, 4, 413, 1561, 22, 8, 632, 2, 4275, 1515, 17, 122, 1597, 69, 165, 137, 408, 192, 2141, 6887, 387, 15, 753, 34, 1285, 495, 120, 71, 93, 174, 9, 1977, 36, 51, 4, 26, 2539, 192, 122, 401, 69, 284, 20, 1386, 1983, 191, 348, 30, 444, 16, 405, 4498, 359, 7934, 18402, 36, 1393, 8, 628, 4, 3, 1285, 495, 1235, 262, 162, 15, 244, 1, 2637, 36, 563, 499, 4, 31, 2, 12, 97, 1871, 5, 1069, 25, 2, 127, 38, 396, 862, 1134, 95, 4, 234, 6802, 46, 272, 309, 17, 1285, 495, 359, 1876, 234, 193, 22, 35, 191, 2592, 1, 38, 247, 26, 946, 2004, 3, 3138, 877, 1, 1285, 495, 2, 211, 193, 2, 1581, 22, 8, 2926, 413, 270, 1515, 211, 174, 6, 1876, 234, 193, 4, 648, 1998, 1947, 2, 3631, 16, 2814, 883, 643, 388, 929, 480, 850, 235, 459, 318, 6, 1107, 3, 3131, 1, 707, 5572, 1, 51, 195, 482, 929, 22, 8, 2592, 1, 38, 247, 2, 1581, 22, 8, 124, 215, 316, 160, 396, 741, 6, 5792, 451, 2, 1814, 1, 229, 472, 2, 235]",1564.0,15837727,540

Five hundred ninety-three pts from 1985 to 2003 with esophageal cancer who underwent surgery with (n = 239) or without CRT (n = 354) were reviewed. Resected esophageal tumors were assessed for pathologic response by determining extent of residual tumor following CRT (P0, 0% residual; P1, 1%-50% residual; P2, >50% residual). After CRT down-staging, pTNM specific survival was similar, irrespective of treatment group (P = 0.98). The pTNM stage distribution was more favorable in the CRT group (P < 0.001) despite a more advanced initial cTNM stage distribution (P < 0.001). Following CRT, the pathologic response (pP) at the primary tumor as defined by extent of residual tumor predicted overall survival (3 years: P0, 0% residual = 74%; P1, 1%-50% residual = 54%; P2, >50% residual = 24%, P < 0.001) and stage specific survival with greater accuracy than pTNM stage alone.

Epoetin-alpha during radiotherapy for stage III esophageal carcinoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2005-06-01,"It has been suggested that hemoglobin levels of 12-14 g/dL are optimal for tumor oxygenation, radiosensitivity, and prognosis. In this prospective study, the authors evaluated the effectiveness of epoetin-alpha to maintain hemoglobin levels at 12-14 g/dL during radiotherapy (RT) for patients with UICC Stage III esophageal carcinoma, and they examined the impact of erythropoetin on overall survival (OS), metastatic-free survival (MFS), and local control (LC). Sixty patients who received RT between March, 2001 and September, 2004, were included in this prospective, nonrandomized study. Thirty patients received epoetin-alpha (150 IU/kg 3 times per week) during RT (Group A), and 30 patients did not receive epoetin-alpha (Group B). Epoetin-alpha was started at hemoglobin levels < 13 g/dL and was stopped at hemoglobin levels > or = 14 g/dL. Hemoglobin was measured before RT and once weekly during RT. Both patient groups were balanced for age, gender, performance status, tumor location/length, histology, grading, tumor classification, lymph node status, chemotherapy, treatment (45-50.4 grays [Gy] plus resection vs. 45.0-50.4 Gy vs. 59.4-66.0 Gy), and hemoglobin level before RT. In 20 of 30 patients (67%) from Group A and in 3 of 30 patients (10%) from Group B, > or = 60% of hemoglobin levels during RT were 12-14 g/dL (P = 0.003). The median change in hemoglobin was + 0.4 g/dL per week in Group A and - 0.4 g/dL per week in Group B.

Differential response to preoperative chemoradiation and surgery in esophageal adenocarcinomas based on presence of Barrett's esophagus and symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2005-05-01,"Barrett's esophagus and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are recognized to predispose to esophageal adenocarcinoma. Abdel-Latif and colleagues recently suggested that esophageal adenocarcinoma patients with GERD might be resistant to multimodality treatment. In this study, we investigated potential differences in clinical outcomes in esophageal adenocarcinoma patients based on the presence of identifiable Barrett's mucosa and/or history of symptomatic GERD. Eighty-four patients with resectable esophageal adenocarcinoma, who completed the planned preoperative chemoradiation and underwent a potentially curative esophageal resection were retrospectively evaluated. Postoperative survival was compared between patients with or without underlying Barrett's esophagus and history of symptomatic GERD. Patients with pathologic complete response (path CR) and those with partial or no response (path PR) were compared to determine if presence of Barrett's esophagus and history of symptomatic GERD influence the path CR rates. We found significantly lower postoperative survival in patients with Barrett's associated adenocarcinoma (vs adenocarcinoma arising de novo, p = 0.031) and patients with symptomatic GERD (vs patients without symptomatic GERD, p = 0.019). Furthermore, the subset of patients with path PR (vs path CR) after chemoradiation have a significantly higher proportion of patients with Barrett's esophagus (HR = 4.38, confidence interval [CI] = 1.39 to 13.83, p = 0.012) and patients with GERD (HR = 2.71, CI = 1.13 to 6.50, p = 0.026).

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for two of the significantly differentially expressed gene products was performed on tissue microarrays. Unsupervised clustering identified two discernable molecular BE profiles, one of which was similar to normal gastric tissue (""BE1""), and another that was shared by several of the AC specimens (""BE2""). The BE1 profile included expression of several genes that have been described as tumor-suppressor genes, most notably trefoil factor 1 (TFF-1). The BE2 profile included expression of genes previously found overexpressed in cancers, such as carboxylesterase-2 (CES-2). IHC demonstrated the loss of TFF-1 late in the progression of BE to AC. It also revealed CES-2 as being upregulated in AC documented to have arisen in the presence of BE.

Significance of the depth of tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis in superficially invasive (T1) esophageal adenocarcinoma.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2005-08-01,"Superficially invasive esophageal adenocarcinomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors, including tumors invading into mucosa and submucosa. The prognostic significance of the depth of tumor invasion and lymph node status in this group of patients remain unclear. We evaluated 90 consecutive patients with resected T1 adenocarcinoma of esophagus or esophagogastric junction. The T1 tumors were classified into four groups based on the depth of invasion: T1a, invading into lamina propria; T1b, into muscularis mucosae; T1c, into superficial submucosa; and T1d, into deep submucosa. The depth of tumor invasion was compared with clinicopathologic features. The depth of tumor invasion was significantly associated with the presence of lymph node metastasis (36% in T1d, 8% in T1c, 12% in T1b, and 0% in T1a; P < 0.001) and with tumor size (76% > 1.2 cm in T1d, 75% in T1c, 35% in T1b, and 25% in T1a; P < 0.001). The 5-year recurrence-free and overall survivals were significantly better in patients with tumors confined to mucosa (100% and 91%, respectively) than invasive into submucosa (60% and 58%; P = 0.0005 and P = 0.02, respectively).

Preclinical experience with docetaxel in gastrointestinal cancers.,Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2005-04-01,"Docetaxel is a semisynthetic taxane that acts primarily by promoting microtubule assembly and preventing the depolymerization of assembled microtubules, thereby inducing mitotic block and inhibition of cell proliferation. This agent also induces apoptosis and appears to prevent angiogenesis. Although docetaxel has shown efficacy in a wide variety of tumors, it has only recently been evaluated in the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers. Data from preclinical studies have shown that docetaxel has substantial in vitro and in vivo activity against gastric, esophageal, and pancreatic tumors. The cytotoxic activity of docetaxel is generally time- and dose-dependent, and greater than that produced by other chemotherapeutic agents, including paclitaxel and anthracyclines. Studies evaluating combination regimens suggest that docetaxel has additive-to-synergistic antitumor activity against gastrointestinal cancers over that produced by the individual agents, and the increased antitumor activity appears to be schedule-dependent. These data suggest that docetaxel has promising therapeutic activity in the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers and provides a rationale for its inclusion in therapeutic protocols either as a single agent or in combination regimens. In addition to combination regimens with conventional chemotherapeutic agents, early studies with a number of novel molecularly targeted therapies in combination with docetaxel have shown encouraging results.

Preoperative and adjuvant therapies for upper gastrointestinal cancers.,Expert review of anticancer therapy,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,2005-08-01,"Survival of esophageal, gastrointestinal junction and gastric cancers is poor given that they frequently present with locally advanced or metastatic disease. The incidence of gastrointestinal junction adenocarcinoma is increasing whereas that of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus is decreasing. The accuracy of staging has improved with newer diagnostic techniques, including positron emission tomography, endoscopic ultrasound and laparoscopy, and this should be integrated in prospective Phase III clinical trials evaluating neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies for some esophageal and all gastric carcinomas. For esophageal cancer (except for one trial by Walsh and colleagues), four randomized Phase III trials comparing preoperative chemoradiation followed by surgery versus surgery alone have not shown a survival benefit. Neither have the trials, where preoperative chemoradiation followed by surgery, is compared with definitive chemoradiation. Nevertheless, it is commonly practiced in the USA and has become a preferred combined modality approach. Postoperative chemoradiation is favored in the USA for good performance status patients with resected, high-risk gastric or gastroesophageal junction carcinoma (more than Stage IA). The UK-MAGIC trial results, showing survival benefit with perioperative chemotherapy in operable gastric and lower esophageal cancers, probably has an impact on the treatment practice of these cancers in Europe and Asia. Promising results from trials involving preoperative chemoradiation followed by surgery in gastric cancer (pathologic complete response of 20-30%) need to be further evaluated in a Phase III setting and compared with postoperative chemoradiation.

Predictors of esophageal cancer risk: assessment of susceptibility to DNA damage using comet assay.,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",Genes Chromosomes Cancer,2005-12-01,"Individuals' susceptibility to DNA damage could be identified by mutagen-challenged assays. We tested the hypothesis that susceptibility to DNA damage, measured by comet assay, may be associated with increased esophageal cancer (EC) risk. We recruited 102 subjects with previously untreated EC and 112 healthy controls. Baseline (untreated), benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE)-induced, and gamma-radiation-induced DNA damage were quantified by the Olive tail moment parameter. The mean tail moment was significantly higher in cases than in controls at baseline (case vs. control: 2.6 vs. 1.9, P < 0.01), after BPDE induction (case vs. control: 3.8 vs. 2.7, P < 0.01), and after gamma-radiation-induction (case vs. control: 5.0 vs. 3.8, P < 0.01). When data were dichotomized with the median values in the controls, a significantly increased risk for EC was observed for high baseline tail moment [odds ratio (OR) = 5.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.9-11.4], high BPDE-induced tail moment (OR = 5.8, 95% CI = 2.9-11.8), and high gamma-radiation-induced tail moment (OR = 4.6, 95% CI = 2.4-8.8). Further, the association between DNA damage and EC was stronger in never smokers than in ever smokers. Compared with subjects not sensitive to both mutagens, individuals sensitive to only one mutagen showed a 3.4-fold risk for EC and those sensitive to both mutagens showed an 8.7-fold risk for EC.

"A phase II trial of gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin in advanced esophageal carcinoma.",Oncology,Oncology,2005-08-23,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the overall response rate, toxicity and overall survival in patients with locally advanced or metastatic esophageal cancer treated with gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin. Patients with either adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus could enroll; however, patients could not have received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Treatment cycles consisted of infusions of all three agents at days 1, 8 and 15, repeated every 28 days. Patients received gemcitabine 1,000, leucovorin 25 and 5-FU 600 mg/m(2). Tumor assessment was performed every 2 cycles. Responses were assessed using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group solid tumor response criteria. Thirty-five patients with metastatic or locally advanced esophageal cancer enrolled. One complete response and ten partial responses were observed for an overall response rate of 31.4%. An additional 11 patients had stable disease as their best response. The median survival was 9.8 months with a 1-year survival rate of 37.1%.

Value of baseline positron emission tomography for predicting overall survival in patient with nonmetastatic esophageal or gastroesophageal junction carcinoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2005-10-01,"The value of baseline positron emission tomography (PET) for predicting overall survival (OS) or disease-free survival (DFS) is unclear in patients with nondistant metastatic (locoregional only) esophageal carcinoma. The authors tested the hypothesis that, in this setting, the number of PET abnormalities (NPA) would correlate with OS and DFS. The authors of the current study analyzed patients with localized esophageal carcinoma (Stages II and III) who had a baseline PET and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and were all treated with chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. The standardized uptake value (SUV) of PET avid lesions were evaluated for: SUV of the primary, NPA, peak SUV, and total SUV. Correlations were performed with baseline EUS results, OS, DFS, and clinical and pathologic response. Forty-seven patients who underwent chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery were analyzed. Most patients had clinical Stage III cancer. NPA was significantly associated with OS (Cox model, P = 0.02; log-rank test, P = 0.04) and DFS (P = 0.04). Patients with NPA > 1 had a death hazard ratio of 4.49 (reference, NPA = 1). In a multivariate analysis, NPA was independently predictive of OS (P = 0.03). Alternatively, SUV of the primary tumor, peak SUV, total SUV, and EUS clinical stage did not correlate with the type of response, OS or DFS.

The authors analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients with carcinoma of the esophagus who underwent preoperative CRT. The residual carcinoma in the resected specimen was categorized into 3 groups (0%, 1-50%, and > 50%). The initial patterns of failure were analyzed according to these categories. Of the 235 patients who underwent CRT, 69 (29%) achieved a pathologic complete response (pathCR; Group A), 109 patients (46%) achieved a response but it was less than a pathCR (1-50% residual carcinoma; Group B), and 57 (24%) had no response (> 50% residual carcinoma; Group C). The time to locoregional recurrence was significantly longer for Group A compared with Group C (P = 0.05). The rate of distant metastases was significantly lower in Groups A and B compared with Group C (14% in Group A, 29% in Group B, and 33% in Group C; P = 0.03). The distant metastases-free survival was found to be significantly longer in Groups A and B compared with Group C (Group A vs. Group B, P = 0.01; Group A vs. Group C, P < 0.0001; and Group B vs. Group C, P = 0.03).

"Randomized, placebo-controlled, esophageal squamous cell cancer chemoprevention trial of selenomethionine and celecoxib.",Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,2005-09-01,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma remains a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Squamous dysplasia, the accepted histological precursor for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, represents a potentially modifiable intermediate end point for chemoprevention trials in high-risk populations. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of selenomethionine 200 microg daily and/or celecoxib 200 mg twice daily (2 x 2 factorial design) among residents of Linxian, People's Republic of China. Subjects had histologically confirmed mild or moderate esophageal squamous dysplasia at baseline. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed before and after a 10-month intervention. Per-subject change (regression, stable, or progression) in the worst dysplasia grade was defined as the primary end point. Results were compared by agent group (selenomethionine vs placebo; celecoxib vs placebo). Two hundred sixty-seven subjects fulfilled all eligibility criteria, and 238 (89%) completed the trial. Overall, selenomethionine resulted in a trend toward increased dysplasia regression (43% vs 32%) and decreased dysplasia progression (14% vs 19%) compared with no selenomethionine (P = .08). In unplanned stratified analyses, selenomethionine favorably affected a change in dysplasia grade among 115 subjects with mild esophageal squamous dysplasia at baseline (P = .02), but not among 123 subjects with moderate esophageal squamous dysplasia at baseline (P = 1.00). Celecoxib status did not influence changes in dysplasia grade overall (P = .78) or by baseline histology subgroup. After a 10-month intervention, neither selenomethionine nor celecoxib inhibited esophageal squamous carcinogenesis for all high-risk subjects. However, among subjects with mild esophageal squamous dysplasia at baseline, selenomethionine did have a protective effect.

Role for the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase PKR in Ad-TNF-alpha gene therapy in esophageal cancer.,Surgery,Surgery,2005-08-01,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is a cytokine with direct antitumor activity. Clinical trials with TNF-alpha have been limited because of the severe side effects of systemic administration. Gene therapy with an adenoviral vector allows delivery of high local doses of TNF-alpha. Activation of protein kinase R (PKR) has been implicated as a general transducer of apoptosis in response to a variety of different stimuli including TNF-alpha. We, therefore, evaluated the role of PKR in Ad-TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in esophageal cancer cells. A tetracycline-responsive adenoviral vector was used to transfect the TNF-alpha gene (Ad-TNF-alpha) into human esophageal cancer cell lines Bic1, Seg1 and TT, as well as in transformed PKR(+/+) and PKR(-/-) early-passage mouse embryo fibroblasts. Ad-luciferase, Ad-Bak, and mock infection with phosphate buffered saline solution were used as controls. Gene expression was determined by Western blot analysis. Apoptosis was detected by propidium iodide staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Overexpression of TNF-alpha in the lysate was evident in all cell lines treated with Ad-TNF-alpha. Treatment with Ad-TNF-alpha was associated with PKR upregulation and induction of apoptosis. Inhibition of TNF-alpha expression by tetracycline resulted in downregulation of PKR and decreased apoptosis. Transduction of PKR(+/+) and PKR(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts with Ad-TNF-alpha demonstrated that Ad-TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis was mediated in part through a PKR-dependent process. These results suggest that Ad-TNF-alpha-mediated apoptosis in esophageal cancer cell lines is dependent in part on PKR upregulation. Strategies to enhance PKR upregulation may allow increased Ad-TNF-alpha antitumoral activity in the treatment of esophageal cancer.",Journal Article,5286.0,14.0,Tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF-alpha is a cytokine with direct antitumor activity Clinical trials with TNF-alpha have been limited because of the severe side effects of systemic administration Gene therapy with an adenoviral vector allows delivery of high local doses of TNF-alpha Activation of protein kinase R PKR has been implicated as a general transducer of apoptosis in response to a variety of different stimuli including TNF-alpha We therefore evaluated the role of PKR in Ad-TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in cancer cells A tetracycline-responsive adenoviral vector was used to transfect the TNF-alpha gene Ad-TNF-alpha into human cancer cell lines Bic1 Seg1 and TT as well as in transformed PKR +/+ and PKR -/- early-passage mouse embryo fibroblasts Ad-luciferase Ad-Bak and mock infection with phosphate buffered saline solution were used as controls Gene expression was determined by Western blot analysis Apoptosis was detected by propidium iodide staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis Overexpression of TNF-alpha in the lysate was evident in all cell lines treated with Ad-TNF-alpha Treatment with Ad-TNF-alpha was associated with PKR upregulation and induction of apoptosis Inhibition of TNF-alpha expression by tetracycline resulted in downregulation of PKR and decreased apoptosis Transduction of PKR +/+ and PKR -/- mouse embryo fibroblasts with Ad-TNF-alpha demonstrated that Ad-TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis was mediated in part through a PKR-dependent process These results suggest that Ad-TNF-alpha-mediated apoptosis in cancer cell lines is dependent in part on PKR upregulation Strategies to enhance PKR upregulation may allow increased Ad-TNF-alpha antitumoral activity in the treatment of cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[30, 1523, 161, 950, 2254, 950, 16, 8, 1675, 5, 1196, 579, 128, 38, 143, 5, 2254, 950, 47, 85, 383, 408, 1, 3, 905, 1152, 176, 1, 403, 634, 145, 36, 5, 35, 4771, 3374, 2333, 989, 1, 64, 293, 415, 1, 2254, 950, 363, 1, 178, 216, 668, 4553, 71, 85, 1771, 22, 8, 1083, 5182, 1, 351, 4, 51, 6, 8, 1362, 1, 338, 7478, 141, 2254, 950, 21, 673, 194, 3, 200, 1, 4553, 4, 1985, 2254, 950, 277, 351, 4, 12, 37, 8, 16651, 2443, 4771, 3374, 10, 95, 6, 33408, 3, 2254, 950, 145, 1985, 2254, 950, 237, 171, 12, 31, 285, 33958, 33959, 2, 3504, 22, 149, 22, 4, 2423, 4553, 2, 4553, 191, 7740, 830, 12803, 3921, 1985, 3864, 1985, 5599, 2, 16680, 930, 5, 4849, 17103, 5969, 5829, 11, 95, 22, 535, 145, 55, 10, 509, 20, 1521, 2639, 65, 351, 10, 530, 20, 10839, 8456, 1029, 2, 1591, 735, 31, 20221, 65, 851, 1, 2254, 950, 4, 3, 8758, 10, 2853, 4, 62, 31, 285, 73, 5, 1985, 2254, 950, 24, 5, 1985, 2254, 950, 10, 41, 5, 4553, 2218, 2, 504, 1, 351, 297, 1, 2254, 950, 55, 20, 16651, 627, 4, 2475, 1, 4553, 2, 340, 351, 2761, 1, 4553, 2, 4553, 830, 12803, 3921, 5, 1985, 2254, 950, 264, 17, 1985, 2254, 950, 277, 351, 10, 517, 4, 760, 298, 8, 4553, 470, 1129, 46, 99, 309, 17, 1985, 2254, 950, 517, 351, 4, 12, 31, 285, 16, 470, 4, 760, 23, 4553, 2218, 422, 6, 1304, 4553, 2218, 68, 1700, 101, 1985, 2254, 950, 13808, 128, 4, 3, 24, 1, 12]",1736.0,16153435,12
New developments in the treatment of esophageal cancer.,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,2004-02-01,"Esophageal cancer is a rare but highly virulent malignancy occurring in the United States and other Western countries. Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus has had the most rapid rate of increase of any solid tumor malignancy in the United States. Controversy continues about the optimal surgical approach for the treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer. Combined chemoradiotherapy is the standard of care in the nonsurgical management of esophageal cancer. Trials of preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery have not shown a consistent benefit for the addition of chemotherapy to surgery. Preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery continues to be actively studied in the surgical management of locally advanced esophageal cancer. Pathologic complete responses are seen in 20-40% of patients, with 5-year survival achieved in 30-35% of patients. Recent randomized trials evaluating the role of surgery after completion of chemoradiotherapy have not clearly shown a benefit for the routine use of surgery after chemoradiotherapy. The toxicity of conventional fluorouracil, cisplatin, and radiation have led researchers to evaluate newer agents, such as the taxanes and irinotecan, in combined chemoradiotherapy trials. These trials have indicated promising antitumor activity and therapy tolerance, depending on the dose and schedule of therapy administered. Increasing the dose of radiotherapy or adding a brachytherapy boost to chemoradiotherapy has not improved the outcome of treatment in clinical trials.

Targeted therapies for esophageal cancer.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2005-09-01,"Esophageal cancer is a highly aggressive neoplasm. In 2005, 14,520 Americans will be diagnosed with esophageal cancer, and more than 90% will die of their disease. On a global basis, cancer of the esophagus is the sixth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In fact, gastric and esophageal cancers together accounted for nearly 1.3 million new cases and 980,000 deaths worldwide in 2000-more than lung, breast, or colorectal cancer. Although esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cases have steadily declined, the incidence of gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma has increased 4%-10% per year among U.S. men since 1976, more rapidly than for any other cancer type, and parallels rises in population trends in obesity and reflux disease. With advances in surgical techniques and treatment, the prognosis of esophageal cancer has slowly improved over the past three decades. However, the 5-year overall survival rate (14%) remains poor, even in comparison with the dismal survival rates (4%) from the 1970s. The underlying reasons for this disappointingly low survival rate are multifold: (a) ineffective screening tools and guidelines; (b) cancer detection at an advanced stage, with over 50% of patients with unresectable disease or distant metastasis at presentation; (c) high risk for recurrent disease after esophagectomy or definitive chemoradiotherapy; (d) unreliable noninvasive tools to measure complete response to chemoradiotherapy; and (e) limited survival achieved with palliative chemotherapy alone for patients with metastatic or unresectable disease. Clearly, additional strategies are needed to detect esophageal cancer earlier and to improve our systemic treatment options.

The genotype groups (0bp/0bp, 6bp/0bp, and 6bp/6bp) were compared for clinical features and overall survival, recurrence-free-survival, locoregional control (LRC), and distant metastasis control. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to find independent predictors for the stated outcomes. There was a trend of association between 6bp/6bp genotype and a decreased risk of local regional recurrence (hazards ratio = 0.211, 95% confidence interval = 0.041-1.095, p = 0.06) compared with other genotypes. There was a trend that patients with 6bp/6bp genotype had a higher 3-year probability of LRC compared with patients with the other two genotypes combined (p = 0.07); however, the difference was not statistically significant. The null hypotheses were not rejected in this study, probably owing to small sample size or the single gene examined.

Investigation of clinical and dosimetric factors associated with postoperative pulmonary complications in esophageal cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2005-10-19,"To assess the association of clinical and especially dosimetric factors with the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications among esophageal cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiation therapy followed by surgery. Data from 110 esophageal cancer patients treated between January 1998 and December 2003 were analyzed retrospectively. All patients received concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery; 72 patients also received irinotecan-based induction chemotherapy. Concurrent chemotherapy was 5-fluorouracil-based and in 97 cases included taxanes. Radiotherapy was delivered to a total dose of 41.4-50.4 Gy at 1.8-2.0 Gy per fraction with a three-dimensional conformal technique. Surgery (three-field, Ivor-Lewis, or transhiatal esophagectomy) was performed 27-123 days (median, 45 days) after completion of radiotherapy. The following dosimetric parameters were generated from the dose-volume histogram (DVH) for total lung: lung volume, mean dose to lung, relative and absolute volumes of lung receiving more than a threshold dose (relative V(dose) and absolute V(dose)), and absolute volume of lung receiving less than a threshold dose (volume spared, or VS(dose)). Occurrence of postoperative pulmonary complications, defined as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) within 30 days after surgery, was the endpoint for all analyses. Fisher's exact test was used to investigate the relationship between categorical factors and incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications. Logistic analysis was used to analyze the relationship between continuous factors (e.g., V(dose) or VS(dose)) and complication rate. Logistic regression with forward stepwise inclusion of factors was used to perform multivariate analysis of those factors having univariate significance (p < 0.05). The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare length of hospital stay in patients with and without lung complications and to compare lung volumes, VS5 values, and absolute and relative V5 values in male vs. female patients. Pearson correlation analysis was used to determine correlations between dosimetric factors. Eighteen (16.4%) of the 110 patients developed postoperative pulmonary complications. Two of these died of progressive pneumonia. Hospitalizations were significantly longer for patients with postoperative pulmonary complications than for those without (median, 15 days vs. 11 days, p = 0.003). On univariate analysis, female gender (p = 0.017), higher mean lung dose (p = 0.036), higher relative volume of lung receiving > or = 5 Gy (V5) (p = 0.023), and smaller volumes of lung spared from doses > or = 5-35 Gy (VS5-VS35) (p < 0.05) were all significantly associated with an increased incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications. No other clinical factors were significantly associated with the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in this cohort. On multivariate analysis, the volume of lung spared from doses > or = 5 Gy (VS5) was the only significant independent factor associated with postoperative pulmonary complications (p = 0.005). Dosimetric factors but not clinical factors were found to be strongly associated with the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in this cohort of esophageal cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiation plus surgery. The volume of the lung spared from doses of > or = 5 Gy was the only independent dosimetric factor in multivariate analysis. This suggests that ensuring an adequate volume of lung unexposed to radiation might reduce the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications.",Journal Article,5207.0,147.0,To assess the

Characterization of pathologic complete response after preoperative chemoradiotherapy in carcinoma of the esophagus and outcome after pathologic complete response.,Cancer,Cancer,2005-12-01,"The purpose of the current study was to test the hypothesis that a lower clinical TNM stage is associated with a higher rate of pathologic complete response (pathCR) in patients with esophageal carcinoma receiving preoperative chemoradiotherapy and to determine whether outcome after pathCR is related to clinical stage or treatment. Clinical parameters and surgical specimens of patients with esophageal carcinoma undergoing preoperative chemoradiotherapy were analyzed to identify predictors of pathCR. In patients with pathCR, predictors of overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and distant recurrence were studied. Sixty-nine (29%) of 235 patients achieved pathCR. In patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage II carcinoma, the proportion achieving pathCR was significantly larger than that achieving <pathCR (65% vs. 35%; P = 0.03). The proportion of patients who received induction chemotherapy was higher in the pathCR group than in the <pathCR group (54% vs. 46%; P = 0.05). However, neither TNM classification, primary tumor location, histologic type, gender, therapy sequence, or radiation dose (45 grays [Gy] vs. 50.4 Gy) were found to have any influence on OS or DFS. The median OS from pathCR was significantly longer than that from <pathCR (133 mos vs. 34 mos; P = 0.002). Similarly, DFS was longer in the pathCR group than in the <pathCR (P = 0.001).

Neoadjuvant therapy for gastric cancer.,"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)","Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",2005-08-01,"Gastric cancer is a global health issue. Most cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage with poor prognosis. Current therapies have a modest impact on survival. Surgery remains the only potentially curative treatment, but is associated with a high rate of locoregional recurrence and distant metastases. Total gastrectomy for proximal cancers is complicated by postoperative morbidity and quality-of-life impairment. Combined-modality therapy may improve outcomes in this disease. Adjuvant therapy for gastric cancer has now become the standard in the Western world. However, adjuvant therapy improves survival by only a few months and is associated with high morbidity. Neoadjuvant therapy is commonly used for esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancers, but is still regarded as investigational in gastric cancer.

"Long-segment, supercharged, pedicled jejunal flap for total esophageal reconstruction.",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg.,2005-10-13,"Many patients with cancer have limited esophageal reconstruction options when the stomach is unavailable as a replacement conduit or when long-segment discontinuity exists. Jejunum has been used as an alternative conduit, both as a pedicled or free flap interposition; however, reports of this are usually limited to short-segment repairs. Microvascular augmentation of a pedicled jejunal flap allows creation of a longer conduit, making it possible to replace the entire esophagus with jejunum. Few reports describe this technique in patients with cancer. We report our initial experience with ""supercharged"" pedicled jejunum as an alternative conduit for total esophageal reconstruction. Review of a prospectively collected departmental database was performed to identify those patients who underwent total esophageal reconstruction with supercharged pedicled jejunum. Data regarding their perioperative course and postoperative function were gathered from the prospectively collected clinical data, review of hospital records, and patient interviews. Total esophageal reconstruction with supercharged pedicled jejunum was attempted in 26 patients (age range, 37-74 years) between March 2000 and April 2004. Twenty-four of 26 patients were ultimately discharged with an intact supercharged pedicled jejunum flap, for an overall success rate of 92.3%. One patient experienced intraoperative flap loss caused by technical difficulties harvesting the flap and never had the flap interposed. One other flap loss occurred in the early postoperative period in a patient who had multisystem organ failure after a prolonged reconstruction. Cervical anastomotic leaks occurred in 19.2% (5/26) of the patients. Two midconduit leaks occurred that were suspicious for iatrogenic perforation from nasogastric tube placement; one required reoperation. One additional early reoperation was performed for cecal ischemia. There were no mortalities. Functional results were available in 95.4% (21/22) of the patients receiving supercharged pedicled jejunum who survived at least 6 months after reconstruction. At the time of follow-up, 95% (20/21) of the patients were tolerating regular diet, and 76.2% (16/21) did not require any supplemental alimentation. Ninety-five percent (20/21) of the patients were free from reflux symptoms, and 80.9% (17/21) had no dumping symptoms. Only 1 patient required dilation of a midconduit stricture. One patient required late reoperation for conduit redundancy. Supercharged pedicled jejunum is a suitable alternative conduit for total esophageal replacement in patients with cancer with otherwise limited reconstructive options. Functional outcomes are excellent, despite the severity of disease and technical challenges in this patient population.",Journal Article,5213.0,49.0,Many patients with cancer have limited reconstruction options when the is unavailable as a replacement conduit or when long-segment discontinuity exists Jejunum has been used as an alternative conduit both as a pedicled or free flap interposition however reports of this are usually limited to short-segment repairs Microvascular augmentation of a pedicled jejunal flap allows creation of a longer conduit making it possible to replace the entire with jejunum Few reports describe this technique in patients with cancer We report our initial experience with `` supercharged '' pedicled jejunum as an alternative conduit for total reconstruction Review of a prospectively collected departmental database was performed to identify those patients who underwent total reconstruction with supercharged pedicled jejunum Data regarding their perioperative course and postoperative function were gathered from the prospectively collected clinical data review of hospital records and patient interviews Total reconstruction with supercharged pedicled jejunum was attempted in 26 patients age range 37-74 years between March 2000 and April 2004 Twenty-four of 26 patients were ultimately discharged with an intact supercharged pedicled jejunum flap for an overall success rate of 92.3 One patient experienced intraoperative flap loss caused by technical difficulties harvesting the flap and never had the flap interposed One other flap loss occurred in the early postoperative period in a patient who had multisystem organ failure after a prolonged reconstruction anastomotic leaks occurred in 19.2 5/26 of the patients Two midconduit leaks occurred that were suspicious for iatrogenic perforation from nasogastric tube placement one required reoperation One additional early reoperation was performed for cecal ischemia There were no mortalities Functional results were available in 95.4 21/22 of the patients receiving supercharged pedicled jejunum who survived at least 6 months after reconstruction At the time of follow-up 95 20/21 of the patients were tolerating regular diet and 76.2 16/21 did not require any supplemental alimentation Ninety-five percent 20/21 of the patients were free from reflux symptoms and 80.9 17/21 had no dumping symptoms Only 1 patient required dilation of a midconduit stricture One patient required late reoperation for conduit redundancy Supercharged pedicled jejunum is a suitable alternative conduit for total replacement in patients with cancer with otherwise limited reconstructive options Functional outcomes are excellent despite the severity of disease and technical challenges in this patient population,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,"[445, 7, 5, 12, 47, 383, 1470, 838, 198, 3, 16, 9098, 22, 8, 3892, 10439, 15, 198, 319, 4610, 33991, 2481, 16027, 71, 85, 95, 22, 35, 1091, 10439, 110, 22, 8, 11558, 15, 115, 3942, 16852, 137, 1198, 1, 26, 32, 2082, 383, 6, 978, 4610, 18439, 6466, 9047, 1, 8, 11558, 10835, 3942, 2333, 7560, 1, 8, 589, 10439, 1079, 192, 899, 6, 7195, 3, 1797, 5, 16027, 1021, 1198, 897, 26, 1312, 4, 7, 5, 12, 21, 414, 114, 388, 730, 5, 24868, 522, 11558, 16027, 22, 35, 1091, 10439, 9, 181, 1470, 206, 1, 8, 1143, 786, 14560, 609, 10, 173, 6, 255, 135, 7, 54, 208, 181, 1470, 5, 24868, 11558, 16027, 74, 666, 136, 1547, 906, 2, 573, 343, 11, 7546, 29, 3, 1143, 786, 38, 74, 206, 1, 702, 1064, 2, 69, 4053, 181, 1470, 5, 24868, 11558, 16027, 10, 4098, 4, 432, 7, 89, 184, 567, 794, 60, 59, 2363, 1081, 2, 2292, 1131, 737, 294, 1, 432, 7, 11, 2050, 6155, 5, 35, 2964, 24868, 11558, 16027, 3942, 9, 35, 63, 1825, 116, 1, 937, 27, 104, 69, 592, 1720, 3942, 407, 1546, 20, 3359, 4679, 17700, 3, 3942, 2, 1737, 42, 3, 3942, 55140, 104, 127, 3942, 407, 489, 4, 3, 191, 573, 727, 4, 8, 69, 54, 42, 17333, 1259, 496, 50, 8, 1069, 1470, 4818, 9674, 489, 4, 326, 18, 33, 432, 1, 3, 7, 100, 44144, 9674, 489, 17, 11, 3230, 9, 16401, 4854, 29, 26438, 2330, 2613, 104, 616, 5077, 104, 402, 191, 5077, 10, 173, 9, 19603, 5675, 125, 11, 77, 9743, 583, 99, 11, 390, 4, 48, 39, 239, 350, 1, 3, 7, 357, 24868, 11558, 16027, 54, 2996, 28, 506, 49, 53, 50, 1470, 28, 3, 98, 1, 166, 126, 48, 179, 239, 1, 3, 7, 11, 16003, 3316, 2453, 2, 846, 18, 245, 239, 205, 44, 1353, 500, 6303, 44145, 2493, 365, 714, 179, 239, 1, 3, 7, 11, 115, 29, 9657, 507, 2, 493, 83, 269, 239, 42, 77, 38057, 507, 158, 14, 69, 616, 8062, 1, 8, 44144, 6673, 104, 69, 616, 807, 5077, 9, 10439, 12589, 24868, 11558, 16027, 16, 8, 2884, 1091, 10439, 9, 181, 3892, 4, 7, 5, 12, 5, 2632, 383, 8060, 838, 583, 123, 32, 1503, 550, 3, 1702, 1, 34, 2, 3359, 1427, 4, 26, 69, 266]",2638.0,16256794,276

Feasibility of using intensity-modulated radiotherapy to improve lung sparing in treatment planning for distal esophageal cancer.,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,Radiother Oncol,2005-11-17,"To evaluate the feasibility whether intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) can be used to reduce doses to normal lung than three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3 DCRT) in treating distal esophageal malignancies. Ten patient cases with cancer of the distal esophagus were selected for a retrospective treatment-planning study. IMRT plans using four, seven, and nine beams (4B, 7B, and 9B) were developed for each patient and compared with the 3 DCRT plan used clinically. IMRT and 3 DCRT plans were evaluated with respect to PTV coverage and dose-volumes to irradiated normal structures, with statistical comparison made between the two types of plans using the Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank test. IMRT plans (4B, 7B, 9B) reduced total lung volume treated above 10 Gy (V(10)), 20 Gy (V(20)), mean lung dose (MLD), biological effective volume (V(eff)), and lung integral dose (P<0.05). The median absolute improvement with IMRT over 3DCRT was approximately 10% for V(10), 5% for V(20), and 2.5 Gy for MLD.

Enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapy in esophageal cancer through inhibition of NF-kappaB.,The Journal of surgical research,J. Surg. Res.,2005-12-09,"Apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs is blocked by activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in some cancer cell lines. Therefore, inhibition of NF-kappaB by adenoviral delivery of an IkappaBalpha super-repressor (Ad.IkappaBalpha-SR) should make esophageal cancer cells more sensitive to 5- fluorouracil (5-FU) and taxotere chemotherapy. SEG1 and BIC1 human esophageal cancer cells were studied. Chemotherapy-induced NF-kappaB activation was assessed by luciferase reporter assay and by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Cell growth inhibition was assessed by cell proliferation assay. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry and caspase 3/7 assay. 5-FU and taxotere significantly induced NF-kappaB activation as measured by luciferase reporter assay (P < 0.005) and EMSA. In both cell lines, Ad.IkappaBalpha-SR enhanced apoptosis by caspase 3/7 assay as compared to chemotherapy alone. In SEG1 cells, pre-treatment with Ad.IkappaBalpha-SR followed by 5-FU (0.25 mm) or taxotere (0.01 ug/ml), led to an increased apoptosis of 183% and 55%, respectively (P < 0.005). Similarly, apoptosis in BIC1 cells was significantly increased by pre-treatment with Ad.IkappaBalpha followed by 5-FU (0.1 mm) or taxotere (0.01 ug/ml) (P < 0.005). Growth inhibition in both cell lines was also significantly increased by pre-treatment with Ad.IkappaBalpha followed by 5-FU (0.01 mm) or taxotere (0.001 ug/ml) (P < 0.0005). Treatment with 5-FU or taxotere induced NF-kappaB activation in human esophageal cancer cells. Inhibition of NF-kappaB by Ad.IkappaBalpha-SR increased their sensitivity to 5-FU and taxotere chemotherapy. Therefore, these results may provide the basis for novel clinical approaches using cytoxic therapy with NF-kappaB inhibition to improve outcome in patients with esophageal cancer.",Journal Article,5156.0,24.0,Apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs is blocked by activation of nuclear factor-kappaB NF-kappaB in some cancer cell lines Therefore inhibition of NF-kappaB by adenoviral delivery of an IkappaBalpha super-repressor Ad.IkappaBalpha-SR should make cancer cells more sensitive to 5- fluorouracil 5-FU and taxotere chemotherapy SEG1 and BIC1 human cancer cells were studied Chemotherapy-induced NF-kappaB activation was assessed by luciferase reporter assay and by electrophoretic mobility shift assay EMSA Cell growth inhibition was assessed by cell proliferation assay Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry and caspase 3/7 assay 5-FU and taxotere significantly induced NF-kappaB activation as measured by luciferase reporter assay P 0.005 and EMSA In both cell lines Ad.IkappaBalpha-SR enhanced apoptosis by caspase 3/7 assay as compared to chemotherapy alone In SEG1 cells pre-treatment with Ad.IkappaBalpha-SR followed by 5-FU 0.25 mm or taxotere 0.01 ug/ml led to an increased apoptosis of 183 and 55 respectively P 0.005 Similarly apoptosis in BIC1 cells was significantly increased by pre-treatment with Ad.IkappaBalpha followed by 5-FU 0.1 mm or taxotere 0.01 ug/ml P 0.005 Growth inhibition in both cell lines was also significantly increased by pre-treatment with Ad.IkappaBalpha followed by 5-FU 0.01 mm or taxotere 0.001 ug/ml P 0.0005 Treatment with 5-FU or taxotere induced NF-kappaB activation in human cancer cells Inhibition of NF-kappaB by Ad.IkappaBalpha-SR increased their sensitivity to 5-FU and taxotere chemotherapy Therefore these results may provide the basis for novel clinical approaches using cytoxic therapy with NF-kappaB inhibition to improve outcome in patients with cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[351, 277, 20, 1573, 600, 16, 2582, 20, 363, 1, 928, 161, 2119, 1365, 2119, 4, 476, 12, 31, 285, 673, 297, 1, 1365, 2119, 20, 4771, 989, 1, 35, 9178, 10582, 7434, 1985, 9178, 7460, 257, 2378, 12, 37, 80, 745, 6, 33, 1404, 33, 1296, 2, 8175, 56, 33959, 2, 33958, 171, 12, 37, 11, 656, 56, 277, 1365, 2119, 363, 10, 275, 20, 3864, 3674, 719, 2, 20, 10980, 5717, 3024, 719, 15941, 31, 129, 297, 10, 275, 20, 31, 457, 719, 351, 10, 509, 20, 1412, 1914, 2, 1469, 27, 67, 719, 33, 1296, 2, 8175, 97, 277, 1365, 2119, 363, 22, 644, 20, 3864, 3674, 719, 19, 13, 1614, 2, 15941, 4, 110, 31, 285, 1985, 9178, 7460, 651, 351, 20, 1469, 27, 67, 719, 22, 72, 6, 56, 279, 4, 33959, 37, 671, 24, 5, 1985, 9178, 7460, 370, 20, 33, 1296, 13, 243, 321, 15, 8175, 13, 355, 23321, 542, 836, 6, 35, 101, 351, 1, 6348, 2, 614, 106, 19, 13, 1614, 1813, 351, 4, 33958, 37, 10, 97, 101, 20, 671, 24, 5, 1985, 9178, 370, 20, 33, 1296, 13, 14, 321, 15, 8175, 13, 355, 23321, 542, 19, 13, 1614, 129, 297, 4, 110, 31, 285, 10, 120, 97, 101, 20, 671, 24, 5, 1985, 9178, 370, 20, 33, 1296, 13, 355, 321, 15, 8175, 13, 144, 23321, 542, 19, 13, 4252, 24, 5, 33, 1296, 15, 8175, 277, 1365, 2119, 363, 4, 171, 12, 37, 297, 1, 1365, 2119, 20, 1985, 9178, 7460, 101, 136, 485, 6, 33, 1296, 2, 8175, 56, 673, 46, 99, 68, 377, 3, 877, 9, 229, 38, 611, 75, 38074, 36, 5, 1365, 2119, 297, 6, 401, 228, 4, 7, 5, 12]",1713.0,16337965,612
Gene expression profiling of localized esophageal carcinomas: association with pathologic response to preoperative chemoradiation.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2005-12-12,"Patients with localized esophageal carcinoma have a 5-year survival rate of less than 20%. Patients are often treated similarly (ie, with preoperative chemoradiotherapy) but the outcomes vary greatly. Chemoradiotherapy and surgery can result in significant undesirable consequences. Currently, however, there are no tools to help select optimum therapy. We hypothesized that gene expression profiling could provide clues and biomarkers for selection of therapy. Pretreatment endoscopic cancer biopsies from 19 patients (16 with adenocarcinoma, two with squamous cell carcinoma, and one with adenosquamous carcinoma) enrolled onto a preoperative chemoradiotherapy protocol were profiled using oligonucleotide microarrays. Surgical specimens following therapy were assessed for the degree of pathologic response. On the basis of array data, selected genes were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis segregated the cancers into two molecular subtypes, each consisting 10 and nine specimens, respectively. Most cancers (five of six) that had pathologic complete response (pathCR) clustered in molecular subtype I. Subtype II, with one exception, consisted cancers that had less than pathCR (< pathCR). Using a combination marker approach, levels of PERP, S100A2, and SPRR3 allowed discrimination of pathCR from < pathCR with high sensitivity and specificity (85%). Pathway analysis identified apoptotic pathway as one of the key functions downregulated in molecular type II in comparison with type I. These encouraging, albeit preliminary, data suggest that expression profiling may distinguish cancers with different pathologic outcome. This is the first report to show subtypes of esophageal cancers with distinct molecular signatures.

Histologic subtypes as determinants of outcome in esophageal carcinoma patients with pathologic complete response after preoperative chemoradiotherapy.,Cancer,Cancer,2006-02-01,"The current study tested the hypothesis that the clinical outcome of patients with localized esophageal carcinoma after preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CTRT) depends on histology. The authors stratified patients by adenocarcinoma (ACA) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and compared the overall survival (OS) and patterns of failure among patients achieving pathologic complete response (pathCR) and <pathCR after preoperative CTRT. A correlation between baseline clinical stage and posttherapy pathologic response was made for ACA and SCC. Of the 235 patients who underwent preoperative CTRT, 42 (18%) had SCC and 193 (82%) had ACA. In the ACA group, 56 patients (29%) achieved a pathCR and in the SCC group 13 patients (31%) achieved a pathCR. In the ACA group, a larger proportion of pathCR patients (n=44; 79%) than <pathCR patients (n=82; 60%) were alive at the time of last follow-up (P=0.01) and pathCR patients had a longer OS than <pathCR patients (P=0.0006). However, in the SCC group OS or proportion alive did not differ significantly between pathCR and <pathCR patients (P>or=0.05). In the ACA group, a greater portion of <pathCR patients (32%) than pathCR patients (16%) had distant metastases (P=0.02) and the distant metastases-free survival of pathCR patients was longer than that of <pathCR patients (P=0.0012).

Endoscopic ultrasonography-identified celiac adenopathy remains a poor prognostic factor despite preoperative chemoradiotherapy in esophageal adenocarcinoma.,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg.,2005-12-05,"We reviewed our experience with preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus and pretreatment endoscopic ultrasonography-identified celiac adenopathy. One hundred eighty-six patients with adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus were staged with endoscopic ultrasonography before treatment from 1997 through 2004. All patients were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT group) and surgical intervention or induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (C-->CRT group) and surgical intervention. Survival analysis (excluding operative mortality) evaluated various pretreatment factors. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that pretreatment endoscopic ultrasonography-identified celiac adenopathy was a significant predictor of decreased long-term survival (P = .03). Median and 3-year survivals were 49 months and 54% in the endoscopic ultrasonography-identified cN0 M0 group (n = 65), 45 months and 56% in the endoscopic ultrasonography-identified cN1 M0 group (n = 96), and 19 months and 12% in the endoscopic ultrasonography-identified celiac adenopathy (cM1a) group (n = 18; P = .03). Increased systemic relapse was noted in the endoscopic ultrasonography-identified cM1a group (44% vs 22%, P = .07). The only factor associated with increased survival in the endoscopic ultrasonography-identified cM1a group (27 vs 15 months, P = .02) was the addition of induction chemotherapy before concurrent chemoradiotherapy and surgical intervention. Endoscopic ultrasonography-identified celiac adenopathy in patients with adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus conveys a poor prognosis despite preoperative chemoradiotherapy. These patients should be stratified in future multimodality trials.

Impact of cyclin D1 A870G polymorphism in esophageal adenocarcinoma tumorigenesis.,Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2005-12-01,"The dramatically increased incidence and poor survival rates of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) underscore the need for novel targets useful for risk assessment and therapeutic intervention. Altered expression of cyclin D1 has been proposed as an early predictor for malignant transformation in EAC; however, the mechanisms underlying cyclin D1 deregulation have not been identified. A single nucleotide polymorphism, A870G, of the cyclin D1 gene has been associated with the preferential encoding of a protein with an extended half-life. We investigated the association of the cyclin D1 A870G polymorphism with cyclin D1 protein expression and clinical characteristics and outcome in 124 patients treated at our institution for EAC. Our results indicate that the cyclin D1 AA/AG genotype is associated with earlier age of cancer onset, cyclin D1 protein deregulation in the primary tumors, and increased frequency of distant metastasis.

Pharmacogenetics in esophageal cancer.,Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2005-12-01,"The current oncology practice of treating cancer with aggressive doses of radiation and chemotherapy is potentially disastrous, as response and side effects vary depending on several factors including pharmacogenetics. This study is the first to evaluate esophageal cancer treatment with a pharmacogenetic paradigm and its application of pharmacogenetic analysis to multiple genes in each drug action pathway as a means of developing a more accurate and consistent risk prediction model. This study has enrolled 235 patients with resectable adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus who had been treated with chemoradiation followed by esophagectomy. The preliminary finding that methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphisms modify 5-fluorouracil response supports the hypothesis that response or resistance to therapy in esophageal cancer patients may be modulated by genetic variants involved in the metabolism or mechanism of chemotherapy drug action. Our ongoing esophageal cancer research aims to determine individual pharmacogenetic profiles to identify patients most likely to have chemotherapeutic benefit and patients with the highest risk of suffering genotoxic side effects.

Association of activated transcription factor nuclear factor kappab with chemoradiation resistance and poor outcome in esophageal carcinoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2006-01-09,"The lack of effective treatment for localized esosphageal cancer leads to poor patient outcome. Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), a transcriptional factor, is constitutively activated or treatment induced in esophageal cancer and may influence treatment outcomes. Pre- and post-treatment cancer specimens from patients enrolled onto a clinical trial were studied for the expression of activated NF-kappaB protein and it was correlated with histologic features, pathologic response, metastatic potential, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS). Forty-three patients undergoing the same therapy on a protocol were studied. Twenty-one (72%) of 29 patients achieving less than complete pathologic response (pathCR) had NF-kappaB positive cancer, but only one (7%) of 14 patients achieving pathCR had NF-kappaB positive cancer (P = < .001). Activated NF-kappaB was significantly associated with aggressive pathologic features such as perineural, lymphatic, and/or vascular invasion (P = .0004). Eight (38%) of 21 NF-kappaB positive patients developed metastases compared to none of 22 NF-kappaB negative patients (P = .001). At a median follow-up of 23 months, 10 (48%) of 21 NF-kappaB positive patients had died compared to only one (5%) of 22 NF-kappaB negative patients (P = .0013). Observations were similar for DFS (P = .0006).

Functional expression of TRAIL receptors TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 in esophageal adenocarcinoma.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",Eur. J. Cancer,2006-01-19,"The tumour necrosis factor (TNF) related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL/Apo2L) is a member of the TNF superfamily that preferentially induces apoptosis in cancer cells, while sparing normal cells. TRAIL induces apoptosis by interacting with its receptors TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2. Recently, new humanized agonistic anti-TRAIL-R1 and anti-TRAIL-R2 antibodies have been developed, and are undergoing phase I/II clinical trails. Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) is associated with significantly poor outcome and is rapidly increasing in incidence in the United States and Western Europe, with virtually no effective non-surgical treatment. The aim of this study was to determine whether human EA tissue express TRAIL-R1 and/or TRAIL-R2, and whether EA cell lines Bic-1 and Seg-1 expresses functional TRAIL-R1 and/or TRAIL-R2. The expression of TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 was determined in sections from 18 human EA by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Sixteen (89%) of the EA expressed TRAIL-R1 and 17 (94%) expressed TRAIL-R2. Both cell lines were found to express TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 by western blot analysis, IHC, and flow cytometry. The fully human agonistic TRAIL-R1 (HGS-ETR1) and TRAIL-R2 (HGS-ETR2) antibodies induced apoptosis in Bic-1 and Seg-1 cells in a time and dose dependent manner. Our results show that the vast majority of primary human EA express TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 and that EA cells lines express functional TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2.

We did a phase I study, in which a fixed dose of carboplatin was combined with a dose escalation schedule of BMS-188797, both administered once every 3 weeks, in patients with advanced solid malignancies. Thirty patients were treated, 11 at the proposed recommended phase II dose. The dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression. There was a linear relationship between administered dose of BMS-188797 and the measured area under the curve (AUC). There was significant interpatient variability of BMS-188797 AUC at the maximum tolerated dose. Two radiographic partial responses were observed: one patient with duodenal adenocarcinoma and one patient with esophageal adenocarcinoma (time on study, 19 and 30 weeks, respectively).

Regular aspirin use and esophageal cancer risk.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2006-07-01,"Given the high mortality rate and the rapidly increasing incidence rate of esophageal carcinoma, chemopreventive agents are highly desirable. Aspirin has been shown to be associated with reduced risk of developing colorectal carcinoma and other cancers. Even though previous studies have shown reduced risk of esophageal cancer associated with aspirin use, results were inconsistent with respect to frequency and duration of use. In this hospital-based case-control study, 163 esophageal cancer cases were compared to 482 age- and sex-matched hospital controls with nonneoplastic conditions. Participants were classified as regular aspirin users if they had taken the drug at least once a week for 6 months. Results suggest that esophageal cancer risk is significantly lower for regular aspirin users compared to nonusers [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.54; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-0.86]. Individuals who used an equivalent of at least 1 aspirin a day (> or =7 tablets/week) were half as likely to have been diagnosed with esophageal carcinoma (aOR 0.47; 95% CI 0.26-0.85), and a linear trend was noted with increasing frequency of use (p(trend) 0.007). Similar protective effects were noted with < or =20 years of use, whereas no risk reduction was noted with >20 years of use. Consistent reduction in risk associated with aspirin use was noted among both the major histological subtypes, but the protective effect appears to be more pronounced in adenocarcinoma compared to squamous cell carcinoma.

The number of lymph nodes with metastasis predicts survival in patients with esophageal or esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma who receive preoperative chemoradiation.,Cancer,Cancer,2006-03-01,"The survival of patients with locoregional adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) who receive preoperative chemoradiation is reported to be better among patients who achieve a pathologic complete response than among patients who have residual tumor, including lymph node (LN) metastasis. However, the prognostic significance of the number of LNs with residual metastasis remains unclear. The authors studied 187 consecutive patients who received chemoradiation followed by an esophagectomy. The number of positive LNs and the size of metastatic tumor in each positive LN were examined with regard to overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). A pathologic complete response was achieved by 29% of patients. No LN metastasis (posttherapy pathologic negative LN status [ypN0]) was present in 49% of patients who had residual carcinoma, and LN metastasis (ypN1) was present in 51% of patients. The 5-year OS and 2-year RFS rates achieved by patients who had 1 positive LN (34% and 45%, respectively) were similar to the rates achieved by patients in the ypN0 group (38% [P = 0.84] and 50% [P = 0.77], respectively) but were significantly better than the rates achieved by patients who had > or = 2 positive LNs (6% [P = 0.02] and 18% [P = 0.01], respectively). The size of metastatic tumor in LNs among patients who had 1 positive LN was a prognostic factor (> or = 4 mm vs. < 4 mm; P = 0.04).

The objectives of the trial were to determine pathologic complete response rate (pCR), overall response rate, progression-free survival, pattern of disease relapse, and two-year and overall survival. Preoperative staging included computed tomography, endoscopic ultrasound, and, when feasible, laparoscopy. Eligible patients were randomized to preoperative prinomastat or placebo, plus continuous infusion 5-FU, cisplatin, paclitaxel, and concurrent radiotherapy. Esophagectomy was performed on day 71. Adjuvant paclitaxel and prinomastat were available to all study patients. Between August 2000 and June 2001, 15 of a planned 78 patients were randomized into the trial. One patient after randomization withdrew consent. Fourteen patients, 7 in each arm, completed preoperative treatment and surgery. pCR was achieved in 5 patients; 1/ 7 prinomastat and 4/ 7 placebo. Disease improvement was achieved in 7 patients; 5 /7 prinomastat and 2 /7 placebo. At a median follow-up of 28 months, 7 patients (2 prinomastat, 5 placebo) are alive with no evidence of disease. The primary prinomastat related toxicity was moderate to severe musculoskeletal toxicity interfering with daily function. This toxicity was managed with treatment rest, dose reduction, or discontinuation. Five patients (3 prinomastat and 2 placebo) had life-threatening thrombo-embolic events, which led to early evaluation of safety and efficacy, and subsequent termination of the study.

Adenoviral vector Ad/TRAIL-F/RGD with a tumor-specific human telomerase reverse transcription promoter was used to transfer TRAIL gene to human esophageal adenocarcinoma and normal human lung fibroblastic cells (NHLF). Activation of apoptosis was analyzed by Western blot, fluorescent activated cell sorting, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate labeling (TUNEL) assay. A human esophageal adenocarcinoma mouse model was treated with intratumoral injections of Ad/TRAIL-F/RGD plus local radiotherapy. The combination of Ad/TRAIL-F/RGD and radiotherapy increased the cell-killing effect in all esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines but not in NHLF cells. This combination also significantly reduced clonogenic formation (p < 0.05) and increased sub-G1 deoxyribonucleic acid accumulation in cancer cells (p < 0.05). Activation of apoptosis by Ad/TRAIL-F/RGD plus radiotherapy was demonstrated by activation of caspase-9, caspase-8, and caspase-3 and cleaved poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase in vitro and TUNEL assay in vivo. Combined Ad/TRAIL-F/RGD and radiotherapy dramatically inhibited tumor growth and prolonged mean survival in the esophageal adenocarcinoma model to 31.6 days from 16.7 days for radiotherapy alone and 21.5 days for Ad/TRAIL-F/RGD alone (p < 0.05).

Ninety-six patients were included. Forty-two patients received epoetin alfa (150 IU/kg, 3 times a week) during radiotherapy, which was started at hemoglobin less than 13 g/dL and stopped at 14 g/dL or higher. Hemoglobin levels were measured weekly during RT. Both groups were balanced for age, sex, performance status, tumor length/location, histology, grading, T-stage/N-stage, chemotherapy, treatment schedule, and hemoglobin before RT. Median change of hemoglobin was +0.3 g/dL/wk with epoetin alfa and -0.5 g/dL/wk without epoetin alfa.

Phase II trial of gemcitabine plus irinotecan in patients with esophageal cancer: a Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) trial.,American journal of clinical oncology,Am. J. Clin. Oncol.,2006-04-01,"Metastatic esophageal carcinoma is an incurable disease with median survival duration of 6 to 8 months. Based on preclinical data suggesting a dose-dependent synergy between gemcitabine and irinotecan we have conducted a phase II trial in patients with advanced or metastatic esophageal carcinoma. Patient eligibility included a diagnosis of squamous cell or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus/gastroesophageal (GE) junction, metastatic or recurrent disease, no CNS metastasis, no prior chemotherapy, prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy was allowed, no prior gemcitabine or irinotecan, performance status of 0 to 2 and adequate organ function. Patients received gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 and irinotecan 100 mg/m2 given day 1 and day 8, every 3 weeks. The primary end point was the 6-month survival rate. The secondary end point was to assess qualitative and quantitative toxicities. Fifty-seven eligible patients were accrued. There were 4 treatment-related deaths. The primary grade 3 to 4 toxic events were diarrhea, dehydration, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and anorexia; and 4 episodes of grade 3 to 5 febrile neutropenia, 1 fatal. The study was designed to detect a difference between the null hypothesis of 30% 6-month survival and the alternative hypothesis of 50% 6-month survival. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of 6-month survival is 56% (95% CI: 43-69%), with a median of 6.3 months. The median time to progression was 3.7 months. The 6-month progression-free survival estimate is 25% (95% CI: 13-36%). The length of survival suggests that this combination has benefit similar to platinum containing regimens, however, the toxicity is substantial and is unlikely to prove superior to platinum containing regimens.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",5043.0,13.0,Metastatic carcinoma is an incurable disease with median survival duration of 6 to 8 months Based on preclinical data suggesting a dose-dependent synergy between gemcitabine and irinotecan we have conducted a phase II trial in patients with advanced or metastatic carcinoma Patient eligibility included a diagnosis of squamous cell or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus/gastroesophageal GE junction metastatic or recurrent disease no CNS metastasis no prior chemotherapy prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy was allowed no prior gemcitabine or irinotecan performance status of 0 to 2 and adequate organ function Patients received gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 and irinotecan 100 mg/m2 given day 1 and day 8 every 3 weeks The primary end point was the 6-month survival rate The secondary end point was to assess qualitative and quantitative toxicities Fifty-seven eligible patients were accrued There were 4 treatment-related deaths The primary grade 3 to 4 toxic events were diarrhea dehydration neutropenia thrombocytopenia anemia and anorexia and 4 episodes of grade 3 to 5 febrile neutropenia 1 fatal The study was designed to detect a difference between the null hypothesis of 30 6-month survival and the alternative hypothesis of 50 6-month survival The Kaplan-Meier estimate of 6-month survival is 56 95 CI 43-69 with a median of 6.3 months The median time to progression was 3.7 months The 6-month progression-free survival estimate is 25 95 CI 13-36 The length of survival suggests that this combination has benefit similar to platinum containing regimens however the toxicity is substantial and is unlikely to prove superior to platinum containing regimens,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[113, 134, 16, 35, 2641, 34, 5, 52, 25, 654, 1, 49, 6, 66, 53, 90, 23, 693, 74, 802, 8, 61, 470, 3439, 59, 679, 2, 1071, 21, 47, 426, 8, 124, 215, 160, 4, 7, 5, 131, 15, 113, 134, 69, 2317, 159, 8, 147, 1, 691, 31, 15, 449, 1, 3, 26500, 3227, 9489, 3322, 113, 15, 387, 34, 77, 1025, 278, 77, 324, 56, 324, 249, 536, 56, 10, 2313, 77, 324, 679, 15, 1071, 528, 156, 1, 13, 6, 18, 2, 1658, 1259, 343, 7, 103, 679, 2345, 81, 821, 2, 1071, 394, 81, 821, 447, 218, 14, 2, 218, 66, 454, 27, 244, 3, 86, 396, 741, 10, 3, 49, 811, 25, 116, 3, 568, 396, 741, 10, 6, 423, 3926, 2, 1156, 385, 1461, 648, 625, 7, 11, 3198, 125, 11, 39, 24, 139, 1043, 3, 86, 88, 27, 6, 39, 1812, 281, 11, 1172, 5414, 778, 1340, 1545, 2, 3373, 2, 39, 3750, 1, 88, 27, 6, 33, 2498, 778, 14, 3034, 3, 45, 10, 1114, 6, 1426, 8, 523, 59, 3, 3505, 1492, 1, 201, 49, 811, 25, 2, 3, 1091, 1492, 1, 212, 49, 811, 25, 3, 876, 882, 1191, 1, 49, 811, 25, 16, 664, 48, 58, 601, 790, 5, 8, 52, 1, 49, 27, 53, 3, 52, 98, 6, 91, 10, 27, 67, 53, 3, 49, 811, 91, 115, 25, 1191, 16, 243, 48, 58, 233, 511, 3, 1318, 1, 25, 844, 17, 26, 150, 71, 247, 288, 6, 828, 1101, 472, 137, 3, 155, 16, 1281, 2, 16, 3568, 6, 4361, 1123, 6, 828, 1101, 472]",1658.0,16601427,685

"Comparison of clinical stage, therapy response, and patient outcome between squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.",International journal of gastrointestinal cancer,Int J Gastrointest Cancer,2005-01-01,"To analyze the differences in clinical stage, pathologic response to chemoradiotherapy, patterns of failure, and overall survival (OS) between patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (ACA) of the esophagus. We stratified patients by two histologies, ACA and SCC, and statistically compared their clinical stage, post-therapy pathologic response, patterns of failure, and OS. Of the 235 patients who underwent preoperative chemoradiotherapy, 42 (18%) had SCC and 193 (82%) had ACA. Among the ACA patients, a significantly larger proportion was male (93% vs 7%; p <0.001), whereas sex was distributed similarly among SCC patients (55% male vs 45% female; p = 0.5). A significantly larger percentage of SCC patients were classified as lower TN and overall stage than ACA patients (T2 = 41% vs 28%, p <0.0001; N0 = 69% vs 48%, p = 0.01; stage II = 76% vs 55%, p <0.001). A significantly greater portion of SCCs was categorized as pathologic N0 after treatment (71% vs 65%; p = 0.02). Among the pathCR patients in clinical stage II, there were significantly greater proportion of SCC patients (77% vs 63%; p <0.001) than ACA patients. Among the pathCR patients in clinical stage III patients, a significantly greater proportion were ACA patients (38% vs 23%; p <0.001) than SCC patients. The median and 5-yr OS was 53 +/- 11 mo and 39% for ACA patients and 35 +/- 14 mo and 37% for SCC (median OS, p = 0.3). Among pathCR patients, median OS of ACA patients (133 mo) was longer than that of SCC patients but nonsignificant (29 mo; p = 0.07); results were similar for non-pathCR patients. DFS results were similar in all subgroups. Among the whole cohort, incidence of local-regional recurrence and distant metastases did not vary significantly. The median time to distant metastases did not vary significantly for pathCR and non-pathCR patients.

Promoter methylation and response to chemotherapy and radiation in esophageal cancer.,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,Clin. Gastroenterol. Hepatol.,2006-05-04,"Multiple studies have shown that promoter methylation of tumor suppressor genes underlies esophageal carcinogenesis. Hypothetically, methylation resulting in tumor suppressor gene inactivation might result in tumors that are unresponsive to chemotherapy and radiation. Accordingly, our aim was to find methylation markers that could be used to predict response to chemoradiation. Tumor specimens were obtained before treatment from 35 patients enrolled in a uniform chemoradiation treatment protocol. Methylation-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed on all samples. Pathology reports from esophagectomy specimens were used to define response to treatment. Thirteen (37%) of 35 patients were responders, and 22 (63%) of 35 patients were nonresponders. The number of methylated genes per patient was significantly lower in responders than in nonresponders (1.4 vs 2.4 genes per patient; Student t test, P = .026). The combined mean level of promoter methylation of p16, Reprimo, p57, p73, RUNX-3, CHFR, MGMT, TIMP-3, and HPP1 was also lower in responders than in nonresponders (Student t test, P = .003; Mann-Whitney test, P = .001). The frequency (15% of responders vs 64% of nonresponders; Fisher exact test, P = .01) and level (0.078 in responders vs 0.313 in nonresponders; Mann-Whitney test, P = .037) of Reprimo methylation was significantly lower in responders than in nonresponders. Reprimo methylation occurred at significantly lower levels and less frequently in chemoradioresponsive than in nonresponsive esophageal cancer patients, suggesting potential clinical application of this single-gene biomarker in defining prognosis and management.

Dose escalation was performed in two phases: The dose was increased as long as healthy tissue dose-volume constraints did not exceed (1) the values from the treatment plan originally used for the patients and (2) clinically acceptable values. No correlation of dose escalation was observed with tumor location, tumor stage, tumor motion, and tumor volume. An increase in dose was observed for many of the patients with as little as 2-mm uniform reduction in PTV margin, with increases in mean PTV dose exceeding 15 Gy for 5 patients. Sixteen of 18 patients experienced a decrease in mean heart, esophagus, and lung dose when margins were reduced and prescription doses were increased. Reduced margins allowed an increased dose to the tumors.

Biomarkers Prev.,2006-05-01,"Selenium is a promising cancer chemoprevention agent. A recent randomized controlled chemoprevention trial found that selenomethionine (SeMet) supplementation for 10 months favorably effected a change in esophageal dysplasia grade among participants who started the trial with mild dysplasia. To further explore the role of SeMet in this trial, we compared gene expression profiles by treatment group using Affymetrix HU 133A chips in before/after supplementation paired normal esophageal biopsies from a subset of 29 trial participants, 16 who received SeMet, and 13 who received placebo. Using P < 0.001 as a cutoff, 11 differentially expressed genes were found in the SeMet supplementation group but these genes did not include either known selenoprotein genes or genes previously shown to be modulated by selenium treatment.

A Phase II trial of vinorelbine in patients with advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.,Cancer investigation,Cancer Invest.,,"Platinum-based combination chemotherapy regimens increasingly are accepted as a first-line treatment option for patients with advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. While active, such regimens also have been associated with toxicity. Vinorelbine is both well tolerated and active in patients with advanced breast, lung cancer, and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, but has not previously been evaluated as a single agent in gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. We, therefore, performed a Phase II study to assess the activity of vinorelbine in this disease. Twenty-nine patients with previously treated or untreated metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma were treated with weekly vinorelbine, administered at a dose of 25 mg/m2, and were followed for evidence of radiologic response, toxicity, and survival. Patients received a median of 8 weeks of therapy. While mild myelosuppression was common, only 17 percent of the treated patients developed Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutropenia. Other toxicities included Grade 1-2 constipation in 31 percent, and Grade 1-2 neuropathy in 13 percent of patients. The overall radiologic response rate was 7 percent, the median progression-free survival time was 1.9 months and the median overall survival time was 7.8 months.

Clin. Oncol.,2006-06-19,"Understanding how specific genetic variants modify drug action pathways may provide informative blueprints for individualized chemotherapy. We applied a pathway-based approach to examine the impact of a comprehensive panel of genetic polymorphisms on clinical outcomes in 210 esophageal cancer patients. In the Cox proportional hazards model, MTHFR Glu429Ala variant genotypes were associated with significantly improved survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.89) in patients treated with fluorouracil (FU). The 3-year survival rates for patients with the variant genotypes and the wild genotypes were 65.26% and 46.43%, respectively. Joint analysis of five polymorphisms in three FU pathway genes showed a significant trend for reduced recurrence risk and longer recurrence-free survival as the number of adverse alleles decreased (P = .004). For patients receiving platinum drugs, the MDR1 C3435T variant allele was associated with significantly reduced recurrence risk (HR = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.64) and improved survival (HR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.85).

Gene expression differences in normal esophageal mucosa associated with regression and progression of mild and moderate squamous dysplasia in a high-risk Chinese population.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2006-07-01,"A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled 2 x 2 factorial chemoprevention trial was conducted in Linxian, China to assess the effects of selenomethionine and celecoxib on the natural history of esophageal squamous dysplasia. Results from this study indicated that asymptomatic adults with mild dysplasia were more likely to show an improvement when treated with selenomethionine compared with placebo (P = 0.02). Prompted by this finding, we examined the molecular profiles associated with regression and progression of dysplastic lesions in normal mucosa from 29 individuals, a subset of the Linxian cohort, using the Affymetrix U133A chip. Twenty differentially expressed genes were associated with regression and 129 were associated with progression when we compared the change in gene expression over time. Genes associated with immune response (n = 15), cell cycle (n = 15), metabolism (n = 15), calcium transport or calcium ion activity (n = 10), regulation of transcription (n = 9), signal transduction (n = 7), cytoskeleton and microtubules (n = 5), nucleotide processing and biosynthesis (n = 4), G-coupled signaling (n = 4), and apoptosis (n = 3) were present in the list of 149 genes. Using the Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer pathway analysis program, only the immune response pathway was significantly overrepresented among these 149 genes.

Epidermal growth factor receptor kinase domain mutations in esophageal and pancreatic adenocarcinomas.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2006-07-01,"Specific activating mutations within the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) identify a subset of non-small cell lung cancers with dramatic sensitivity to the specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), gefitinib and erlotinib. Despite the abundant expression of EGFR protein in a broad range of epithelial cancers, EGFR mutations have not been reported in a substantial fraction of other cancers. Given recent reports of TKI-responsive cases of esophageal and pancreatic cancer, this study was designed to determine the prevalence of EGFR mutations in these gastrointestinal cancers. We sequenced exons 18 to 21 of EGFR from 21 cases of Barrett's esophagus, 5 cases of high-grade esophageal dysplasia, 17 cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma, and 55 cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Subsets of esophageal (n = 7) and pancreatic cancer cases (n = 5) were obtained from patients who were subsequently treated with gefitinib or erlotinib-capecitabine, respectively. Mutations of EGFR were identified in two esophageal cancers (11.7%), three cases of Barrett's esophagus (14.2%), and two pancreatic cancers (3.6%). The mutations consisted of the recurrent missense L858R and in-frame deletion delE746-A750, previously characterized as activating EGFR mutations in non-small cell lung cancer. We also identified the TKI drug resistance-associated EGFR T790M mutation in an untreated case of Barrett's esophagus and the corresponding adenocarcinoma. The presence of activating mutations within EGFR in both esophageal and pancreatic adenocarcinomas defines a previously unrecognized subset of gastrointestinal tumors in which EGFR signaling may play an important biological role. EGFR mutations in premalignant lesions of Barrett's esophagus also point to these as an early event in transformation of the esophageal epithelium. The role of genotype-directed TKI therapy should be tested in prospective clinical trials.",Journal Article,4952.0,141.0,Specific activating mutations within the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR identify a subset of cell cancers with dramatic sensitivity to the specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors TKI gefitinib and erlotinib Despite the abundant expression of EGFR protein in a broad range of epithelial cancers EGFR mutations have not been reported in a substantial fraction of other cancers Given recent reports of TKI-responsive cases of and cancer this study was designed to determine the prevalence of EGFR mutations in these cancers We sequenced exons 18 to 21 of EGFR from 21 cases of Barrett 's 5 cases of high-grade dysplasia 17 cases of adenocarcinoma and 55 cases of adenocarcinoma Subsets of n 7 and cancer cases n 5 were obtained from patients who were subsequently treated with gefitinib or erlotinib-capecitabine respectively Mutations of EGFR were identified in two cancers 11.7 three cases of Barrett 's 14.2 and two cancers 3.6 The mutations consisted of the recurrent missense L858R and in-frame deletion delE746-A750 previously characterized as activating EGFR mutations in cell cancer We also identified the TKI drug resistance-associated EGFR T790M mutation in an untreated case of Barrett 's and the corresponding adenocarcinoma The presence of activating mutations within EGFR in both and adenocarcinomas defines a previously unrecognized subset of tumors in which EGFR signaling may play an important biological role EGFR mutations in premalignant lesions of Barrett 's also point to these as an early event in transformation of the epithelium The role of genotype-directed TKI therapy should be tested in prospective clinical trials,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[112, 1616, 138, 262, 3, 829, 129, 161, 153, 227, 255, 8, 697, 1, 31, 163, 5, 3079, 485, 6, 3, 112, 564, 216, 222, 1379, 1372, 2, 962, 550, 3, 4834, 55, 1, 227, 178, 4, 8, 2094, 184, 1, 701, 163, 227, 138, 47, 44, 85, 210, 4, 8, 1281, 1509, 1, 127, 163, 447, 435, 1198, 1, 1379, 2443, 140, 1, 2, 12, 26, 45, 10, 1114, 6, 223, 3, 1078, 1, 227, 138, 4, 46, 163, 21, 4040, 3885, 203, 6, 239, 1, 227, 29, 239, 140, 1, 4366, 292, 33, 140, 1, 64, 88, 2253, 269, 140, 1, 449, 2, 614, 140, 1, 449, 1890, 1, 78, 67, 2, 12, 140, 78, 33, 11, 683, 29, 7, 54, 11, 1611, 73, 5, 1372, 15, 962, 1629, 106, 138, 1, 227, 11, 108, 4, 100, 163, 175, 67, 169, 140, 1, 4366, 292, 213, 18, 2, 100, 163, 27, 49, 3, 138, 1695, 1, 3, 387, 4007, 5469, 2, 4, 5331, 1528, 55653, 34121, 373, 765, 22, 1616, 227, 138, 4, 31, 12, 21, 120, 108, 3, 1379, 234, 251, 41, 227, 2813, 258, 4, 35, 1278, 473, 1, 4366, 292, 2, 3, 1734, 449, 3, 463, 1, 1616, 138, 262, 227, 4, 110, 2, 1586, 5849, 8, 373, 6055, 697, 1, 57, 4, 92, 227, 314, 68, 1343, 35, 305, 1037, 200, 227, 138, 4, 4343, 406, 1, 4366, 292, 120, 741, 6, 46, 22, 35, 191, 774, 4, 1392, 1, 3, 2781, 3, 200, 1, 1183, 1166, 1379, 36, 257, 40, 650, 4, 482, 38, 143]",1643.0,16857803,113
"The addition of induction chemotherapy to preoperative, concurrent chemoradiotherapy improves tumor response in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma.",Cancer,Cancer,2006-09-01,"Tumor viability assessed by pathologic analysis of resected specimens in patients with preoperatively treated esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a prognostic indicator. The feasibility of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and surgery for patients with locoregionally advanced EAC has been demonstrated. In this study, the authors evaluated the efficacy of CCRT compared with traditional concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT). The authors retrospectively reviewed 247 consecutive patients with EAC who presented for planned surgery after treatment with either CCRT or CRT from January 1997 through August 2003. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and tumor characteristics were analyzed. Pathologic tumor response, overall survival, and disease-free survival were assessed according to treatment. One hundred seventeen patients received CCRT, and 130 patients received CRT before planned surgical resection. CCRT resulted in a 64% tumor response rate compared with a 51% tumor response rate in the CRT group (odds ratio, 1.73; P = .035). In the CCRT group, the median overall survival was 55 months, and the 3-year overall survival rate was 59%; in the CRT group, the median overall survival was 25 months, and the 3-year overall survival rate was 41% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; P = .041). In the CCRT group, the median disease-free survival was 43 months, and the 3-year disease-free survival rate was 54%; in the CRT group, the median disease-free survival was 18 months, and the 3-year disease-free survival rate was 36% (HR, 0.72; P = .047). Subset analysis of patients with clinical Stage III/IVA disease showed a median overall survival of 51 months with a 3-year overall survival rate of 58% in the CCRT group and a median overall survival of 20 months with a 3-year overall survival rate of 28% in the CRT group (HR, 0.57; P = .019).

Early detection of chemoradioresponse in esophageal carcinoma by 3'-deoxy-3'-3H-fluorothymidine using preclinical tumor models.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2006-08-01,"Early identification of esophageal cancer patients who are responding or resistant to combined chemoradiotherapy may lead to individualized therapeutic approaches and improved clinical outcomes. We assessed the ability of 3'-deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine positron emission tomography (FLT-PET) to detect early changes in tumor proliferation after chemoradiotherapy in experimental models of esophageal carcinoma. The in vitro and ex vivo tumor uptake of [(3)H]FLT in SEG-1 human esophageal adenocarcinoma cells were studied at various early time points after docetaxel plus irradiation and validated with conventional assessments of cellular proliferation [thymidine (Thd) and Ki-67] and [(18)F]FLT micro-PET imaging. Imaging-histologic correlation was determined by comparing spatial Ki-67 and [(18)F]FLT distribution in autoradiographs. Comparison with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was done in all experiments. In vitro [(3)H]FLT and [(3)H]Thd uptake rapidly decreased in SEG-1 cells 24 hours after docetaxel with a maximal reduction of over 5-fold (P = 0.005). The [(3)H]FLT tumor-to-muscle uptake ratio in xenografts declined by 75% compared with baseline (P < 0.005) by 2 days after chemoradiotherapy, despite the lack of change in tumor size. In contrast, the decline of [(3)H]FDG uptake was gradual and less pronounced. Tumor uptake of [(3)H]FLT was more closely correlated with Ki-67 expression (r = 0.89, P < 0.001) than was [(3)H]FDG (r = 0.39, P = 0.08). Micro-PET images depicted similar trends in reduction of [(18)F]FLT and [(18)F]FDG tumor uptake.

Expression of annexin A1 in esophageal and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinomas: association with poor outcome.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2006-08-01,"Annexin A1 (ANXA1) is a calcium-binding protein involved in arachidonic acid metabolism and epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase pathway. ANXA1 has been implicated in early squamous cell carcinogenesis of esophagus and correlates with degree of tumor differentiation. However, the role of ANXA1 in esophageal adenocarcinoma is unclear. Our goal was to evaluate ANXA1 expression and determine its prognostic significance in adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction. This study included 104 consecutive patients with primary resected esophageal and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinomas (11 stage I, 24 stage II, 53 stage III, and 16 stage IV). ANXA1 protein expression in each tumor was assessed by immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays. ANAX1 expression level was classified as high (>/=25% of tumor cells with cytoplasmic staining), low (<25% of tumor cells with cytoplasmic staining), or negative; and was correlated with clinicopathologic features and patients' outcomes. High ANXA1 expression was present in 39% (41 of 104) of tumors and was associated with higher pathologic T stage (P = 0.03) and distant metastasis (P = 0.04). High ANXA1 expression correlated with increased recurrence rate (P = 0.004) and decreased overall survival (P = 0.003) in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, ANXA1 expression and pN stage significantly correlated with recurrence rate (P = 0.008 and P < 0.001, respectively) and overall survival (P = 0.02 and P < 0.001, respectively) independent of T stage.

The significance of neuroendocrine differentiation in adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction after preoperative chemoradiation.,Cancer,Cancer,2006-10-01,"Esophageal and esophagogastric junction (EGJ) adenocarcinomas frequently have neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation, but the significance of NE differentiation in patients who have undergone preoperative chemoradiation and resection remains unclear. The authors evaluated the presence of NE differentiation in esophageal and EGJ adenocarcinomas by immunohistochemistry for chromogranin A and synaptophysin and evaluated the clinical significance of NE differentiation in 83 patients (10 patients who had a complete tumor response and 73 patients who had residual tumor in resection specimens) who received preoperative chemoradiation. Of 73 patients who had residual tumor after preoperative treatment, 52% showed NE differentiation. The proportion of tumor cells with NE differentiation had increased from 6% +/- 18% in pretreatment biopsy specimens to 47% +/- 42% (P = .00003) in posttreatment resection specimens in 30 patients who had paired pretreatment biopsy and resection specimens available. Disease-free survival (P = .002) and overall survival (P = .006) were significantly better in patients who had a complete tumor response than in patients who had residual tumor. Among patients who had residual tumor after preoperative chemoradiation, disease-free survival (P = .03) and overall survival (P = .045) were significantly better in patients who had residual tumor without NE differentiation than in patients who had residual tumor with NE differentiation. In multivariate analysis, the presence of NE differentiation in residual tumor was a prognostic factor for worse disease-free survival (P = .02) independent of pathologic stage and extent of residual tumor.

The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of patients with these diseases who have familial Barrett's esophagus. Information on gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, known risk factors for Barrett's esophagus, and family history of Barrett's esophagus and cancers, was collected at six hospitals using a structured questionnaire from probands with either long-segment Barrett's esophagus, adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, or adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction. Family history of Barrett's esophagus or esophageal cancer in a first- or second-degree relative was determined by reviewing medical records of all relatives reported to be affected. Seventy one of 411 (17.3%) probands reported an affected first- and/or second-degree relative. Upon review of medical records of the reportedly affected relatives, familial Barrett's esophagus was definitively determined in the case of 30 (7.3%) probands comprising 17 of 276 (6.2%) with Barrett's esophagus, 11 of 116 (9.5%) with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, and 2 of 21 (9.5%) with adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction.

Endoscopic retrograde dilation of completely occlusive esophageal strictures.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2006-10-01,"Completely occlusive esophageal strictures may develop after head and neck radiotherapy or esophagectomy with gastric or colonic interposition. Major surgical intervention may be required to restore alimentary tract patency when endoscopic lumen reconstitution is not feasible by routine antegrade endoscopy. Retrograde endoscopic lumen identification and dilation is a useful method to reestablish alimentary tract patency, thereby avoiding surgical intervention. Patients requiring endoscopic dilation for completely occlusive esophageal strictures were identified by the gastroenterology, thoracic, and head and neck services. Retrograde access was obtained by balloon dilation of either a jejunostomy or gastrostomy tract, and an endoscope was passed to the area of stricture. Antegrade and retrograde endoscopy were performed simultaneously. A guidewire was passed either retrograde or antegrade under direct endoscopic visualization, followed by antegrade Savary dilation under fluoroscopic guidance. From 2003 to 2006, 9 patients were identified with completely occlusive esophageal strictures requiring retrograde lumen identification and dilation. Stricture developed in 6 patients after radiotherapy for head and neck cancer and in 3 after esophagectomy with either gastric or colonic interposition for esophageal cancer.

Deficiency of cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair system predispose individuals to esophageal cancer.,Mutation research,Mutat. Res.,2006-10-02,"Cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair capacity are critical for the maintenance of genome integrity. We hypothesized that, in comparison to healthy controls, esophageal cancer patients might have a higher frequency of deficiencies in cell cycle checkpoints and/or DNA repair system. Using flow cytometry and comet assay, we assessed the gamma-radiation-induced S phase and G2-M phase accumulation, and benzo(a)pyrene-diol-epoxide (BPDE)- and gamma-radiation-induced DNA damage, in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 99 newly diagnosed esophageal cancer patients and 112 age-, gender-, and ethnicity-matched healthy controls. The mean gamma-radiation-induced cell accumulation at G2-M phase was significantly lower in esophageal cancer patients than the control subjects (case versus control: 5.27%+/-5.11% versus. 7.06%+/-5.04%, P = 0.013). The less G2-M phase cell accumulation resulted in a significant increased risk for esophageal cancer with an odds ratio of 2.08 (95% confidence interval 1.15-3.77). After normalization to baseline S fraction, the radiation-induced increment in the 4N/2N ratio was also significantly lower in esophageal cancer patients than in controls (case versus control: 0.76% versus 1.04%, P = 0.0039). The less increment in the radiation-induced 4N/2N ratio was associated with 2.24(95% confidence interval 1.22-4.11)-fold increase of esophageal cancer risk. We also compared the mutagen-induced DNA damage level among individuals with different S or G2-M phase cell accumulation. We found that the less G2-M phase accumulation was associated with both high BPDE induced and gamma-radiation-induced DNA damage in the healthy controls (P for trend = 0.023 and 0.015, respectively). Similar pattern was observed for S phase accumulation (P for trend = 0.033 and 0.022, respectively). However, such association was not seen in esophageal cancer patients.

The prevalence of myocardial ischemia after concurrent chemoradiation therapy as detected by gated myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with esophageal cancer.,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",J. Nucl. Med.,2006-11-01,"The detection of myocardial perfusion abnormalities after radiation therapy (RT) has been investigated previously in patients with lymphoma and breast cancer. However, the prevalence and association of such abnormalities with RT in esophageal cancer patients have not been investigated previously. The prevalence of myocardial perfusion abnormalities detected using gated myocardial perfusion imaging (GMPI) in patients with esophageal cancer after RT (RT group) was compared with that in patients with esophageal cancer who did not undergo RT (NRT group). The patients' data were extracted from a prospectively collected database. The results of GMPI that were read by multiple readers were tested further by an expert reader who was unaware of the patients' clinical information. This reader's findings were correlated with the different RT isodose lines as seen in the CT for RT planning. Isodose lines containing the affected segments in GMPI as well as the rest of the left ventricle were recorded. Additionally, information with regard to the mean radiation dose to the heart for each patient was collected. An overall, mean radiation dose to the heart in patients with abnormal GMPI studies was compared with that in patients with normal GMPI studies. Fifty-one patients were included, 26 in the RT group and 25 in the NRT group. The mean and median interval between RT and GMPI was 7.5 and 3.0 mo, respectively. We identified myocardial perfusion defects in 14 patients (54%) in the RT group and in 4 patients (16%) in the NRT group. Eleven patients (42%) in the RT group had mild inferior wall ischemia versus only 1 patient (4%) in the NRT group (P = 0.001). All of the patients with inferior wall ischemia had distal esophageal cancer. The remaining 12 patients in the RT group and 21 patients in the NRT group had normal GMPI results. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 59.0% +/- 10.7% in the RT group and 59.3% +/- 9.8% in the NRT group (P = not significant). Good agreement was found between the GMPI results interpreted by multiple readers and those of the single expert reader (kappa = 0.84).

Hedgehog: an attribute to tumor regrowth after chemoradiotherapy and a target to improve radiation response.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2006-11-01,"Despite aggressive chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, or combination approaches, the survival rate of patients with esophageal cancer remains poor. Recent studies have suggested that constitutive activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway in cancers of the digestive tract may contribute to the growth and maintenance of cancer. However, the relationship between Hh signaling and therapeutic response is unknown. The expression and temporal kinetics of Hh signaling and proliferation biomarkers after chemoradiotherapy were examined in esophageal tumor xenografts. Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis of Sonic Hh (Shh) and Gli-1 expression were done on residual tumors from patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. The ability of Shh signaling to induce proliferation in esophageal cell lines was determined. Expression of cell cycle checkpoint proteins was analyzed in cells in which Hh signaling was activated or inhibited. We further determined the effect of inhibiting Hh signaling in sensitizing esophageal tumors to radiation. We showed that the Shh signaling pathway was extensively activated in esophageal cancer xenografts and residual tumors after chemoradiotherapy and the temporal kinetics of Hh signaling preceded increases in proliferation biomarker expression and tumor size during tumor regrowth. We further showed that Hh pathway activity influences proliferation rates of esophageal cancer cell lines through up-regulation of the G1-cyclin-Rb axis. Additionally, we found that blocking Hh signaling enhanced radiation cytotoxicity of esophageal cancer cells. These results suggest that activation of the Hh pathway may promote tumor repopulation after chemoradiotherapy and contribute to chemoradiation resistance in esophageal cancers.",Journal Article,4829.0,114.0,Despite aggressive chemotherapy radiotherapy surgery or combination approaches the survival rate of patients with cancer remains poor Recent studies have suggested that constitutive activation of the Hedgehog Hh pathway in cancers of the digestive tract may contribute to the growth and maintenance of cancer However the relationship between Hh signaling and therapeutic response is unknown The expression and temporal kinetics of Hh signaling and proliferation biomarkers after chemoradiotherapy were examined in tumor xenografts Additionally immunohistochemical analysis of Sonic Hh Shh and Gli-1 expression were done on residual tumors from patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery The ability of Shh signaling to induce proliferation in cell lines was determined Expression of cell cycle checkpoint proteins was analyzed in cells in which Hh signaling was activated or inhibited We further determined the effect of inhibiting Hh signaling in sensitizing tumors to radiation We showed that the Shh signaling pathway was extensively activated in cancer xenografts and residual tumors after chemoradiotherapy and the temporal kinetics of Hh signaling preceded increases in proliferation biomarker expression and tumor size during tumor regrowth We further showed that Hh pathway activity influences proliferation rates of cancer cell lines through up-regulation of the G1-cyclin-Rb axis Additionally we found that blocking Hh signaling enhanced radiation cytotoxicity of cancer cells These results suggest that activation of the Hh pathway may promote tumor repopulation after chemoradiotherapy and contribute to chemoradiation resistance in cancers,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[550, 571, 56, 310, 152, 15, 150, 611, 3, 25, 116, 1, 7, 5, 12, 469, 334, 435, 94, 47, 1148, 17, 3178, 363, 1, 3, 4097, 4474, 308, 4, 163, 1, 3, 9117, 1696, 68, 1248, 6, 3, 129, 2, 1146, 1, 12, 137, 3, 858, 59, 4474, 314, 2, 189, 51, 16, 860, 3, 55, 2, 3264, 3839, 1, 4474, 314, 2, 457, 582, 50, 1464, 11, 409, 4, 30, 1348, 1724, 1382, 65, 1, 10025, 4474, 5170, 2, 10754, 14, 55, 11, 1822, 23, 753, 57, 29, 7, 54, 103, 536, 1464, 370, 20, 152, 3, 801, 1, 5170, 314, 6, 1290, 457, 4, 31, 285, 10, 509, 55, 1, 31, 417, 986, 652, 10, 311, 4, 37, 4, 92, 4474, 314, 10, 735, 15, 879, 21, 195, 509, 3, 254, 1, 2062, 4474, 314, 4, 5979, 57, 6, 121, 21, 224, 17, 3, 5170, 314, 308, 10, 3576, 735, 4, 12, 1348, 2, 753, 57, 50, 1464, 2, 3, 3264, 3839, 1, 4474, 314, 6083, 1106, 4, 457, 901, 55, 2, 30, 444, 190, 30, 8673, 21, 195, 224, 17, 4474, 308, 128, 3859, 457, 151, 1, 12, 31, 285, 298, 126, 863, 1, 3, 3344, 1226, 2955, 2310, 1724, 21, 204, 17, 2521, 4474, 314, 651, 121, 1408, 1, 12, 37, 46, 99, 309, 17, 363, 1, 3, 4474, 308, 68, 1617, 30, 17148, 50, 1464, 2, 1248, 6, 975, 251, 4, 163]",1681.0,17085672,104
Phase II study of preoperative paclitaxel/cisplatin with radiotherapy in locally advanced esophageal cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2006-11-09,"Preoperative paclitaxel-based chemoradiotherapy may improve the response rates and survival in patients with localized esophageal cancer. We evaluated paclitaxel-based induction chemoradiotherapy in patients with localized esophageal cancer to determine its feasibility, clinical response, pathologic response, and overall survival. Between 1995 and 1998, 50 patients were enrolled in this study. At study entry, patients were categorized as either resectable or unresectable according to evaluation by an experienced thoracic surgeon. All patients were treated with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on Day 1, 29 with radiotherapy to 3,000 cGy in 15 fractions. Resectable patients underwent esophagectomy 4 weeks later. Postoperatively, patients received two cycles of paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 on Day 1 and 5-fluorouracil 350 mg/m2 and leucovorin 300 mg on Days 1-3, given every 28 days. Patients who were deemed unsuitable for resection from the outset continued radiotherapy to a total dose of 6,000 cGy. Of the 50 patients, all began neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, 40 patients underwent surgery, and 25 patients completed postoperative chemotherapy. A pathologic complete response was seen in 7 patients (17.5%). Patients with a pathologic response had a median survival of 32.4 months vs. 14.4 months for nonresponders (p < 0.001). Patients with a clinical response had a median survival of 25.2 months compared with 15.6 months for nonresponders (p = 0.002). At a median follow up of 19.8 months (range 2.4-100.8), the median survival was 20.4 months and the 3-year overall survival rate was 23.2%. Although preoperative cisplatin/paclitaxel with 3,000 cGy was tolerable, this multimodality regimen did not appear to be superior to standard cisplatin/5-fluorouracil-containing regimens and its use is not recommended.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",4821.0,20.0,"Preoperative paclitaxel-based chemoradiotherapy may improve the response rates and survival in patients with localized cancer We evaluated paclitaxel-based induction chemoradiotherapy in patients with localized cancer to determine its feasibility clinical response pathologic response and overall survival Between 1995 and 1998 50 patients were enrolled in this study At study entry patients were categorized as either resectable or unresectable according to evaluation by an experienced thoracic surgeon All patients were treated with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on Day 1 29 with radiotherapy to 3,000 cGy in 15 fractions Resectable patients underwent esophagectomy 4 weeks later Postoperatively patients received two cycles of paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 on Day 1 and 5-fluorouracil 350 mg/m2 and leucovorin 300 mg on Days 1-3 given every 28 days Patients who were deemed unsuitable for resection from the outset continued radiotherapy to a total dose of 6,000 cGy Of the 50 patients all began neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy 40 patients underwent surgery and 25 patients completed postoperative chemotherapy A pathologic complete response was seen in 7 patients 17.5 Patients with a pathologic response had a median survival of 32.4 months vs. 14.4 months for nonresponders p 0.001 Patients with a clinical response had a median survival of 25.2 months compared with 15.6 months for nonresponders p 0.002 At a median follow up of 19.8 months range 2.4-100.8 the median survival was 20.4 months and the 3-year overall survival rate was 23.2 Although preoperative cisplatin/paclitaxel with 3,000 cGy was tolerable this multimodality regimen did not appear to be superior to standard cisplatin/5-fluorouracil-containing regimens and its use is not recommended",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[498, 490, 90, 1464, 68, 401, 3, 51, 151, 2, 25, 4, 7, 5, 909, 12, 21, 194, 490, 90, 504, 1464, 4, 7, 5, 909, 12, 6, 223, 211, 1437, 38, 51, 510, 51, 2, 63, 25, 59, 2323, 2, 1850, 212, 7, 11, 346, 4, 26, 45, 28, 45, 3001, 7, 11, 2320, 22, 361, 1899, 15, 1468, 768, 6, 451, 20, 35, 592, 2098, 1897, 62, 7, 11, 73, 5, 490, 3300, 81, 821, 2, 540, 481, 81, 821, 23, 218, 14, 462, 5, 310, 6, 27, 984, 3071, 4, 167, 1550, 1899, 7, 208, 3617, 39, 244, 1559, 3541, 7, 103, 100, 410, 1, 490, 3300, 81, 821, 23, 218, 14, 2, 33, 1404, 5408, 81, 821, 2, 3296, 2036, 81, 23, 162, 14, 27, 447, 454, 339, 162, 7, 54, 11, 3779, 12277, 9, 170, 29, 3, 23143, 1351, 310, 6, 8, 181, 61, 1, 49, 984, 3071, 1, 3, 212, 7, 62, 4603, 536, 1464, 327, 7, 208, 152, 2, 243, 7, 781, 573, 56, 8, 510, 236, 51, 10, 527, 4, 67, 7, 269, 33, 7, 5, 8, 510, 51, 42, 8, 52, 25, 1, 531, 39, 53, 105, 213, 39, 53, 9, 4498, 19, 13, 144, 7, 5, 8, 38, 51, 42, 8, 52, 25, 1, 243, 18, 53, 72, 5, 167, 49, 53, 9, 4498, 19, 13, 1111, 28, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 326, 66, 53, 184, 18, 39, 394, 66, 3, 52, 25, 10, 179, 39, 53, 2, 3, 27, 111, 63, 25, 116, 10, 382, 18, 242, 498, 540, 490, 5, 27, 984, 3071, 10, 2668, 26, 2425, 477, 205, 44, 1322, 6, 40, 1123, 6, 260, 540, 33, 1404, 1101, 472, 2, 211, 119, 16, 44, 793]",1766.0,17097833,136
"Pretherapy nuclear factor-kappaB status, chemoradiation resistance, and metastatic progression in esophageal carcinoma.",Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2006-11-01,"Transcriptional factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) seems to be associated with aggressive clinical biology (chemoradiation resistance and metastatic progression) of esophageal cancer. We hypothesized that activated NF-kappaB would define clinical biology irrespective of the type of chemotherapy or sequence administered. Pretherapy and/or posttherapy cancer specimens were examined for activated NF-kappaB and correlated with pathologic response to chemoradiation, metastatic potential, overall survival, disease-free survival, and type of chemotherapy or sequence used. Eighty patients undergoing chemotherapy and concurrent radiation were studied. Activated NF-kappaB prior to any therapy was associated with the lack of complete pathologic response (pathCR, P = 0.006). Forty-five (78%) of 58 patients achieving <pathCR had activated NF-kappaB in pretherapy and/or posttherapy cancer specimens versus 2 (9%) of 22 patients with pathCR (P = 0.001). Twenty-four (51%) of 47 patients with activated NF-kappaB in cancer developed metastases versus 7 (21%) of 22 patients with negative NF-kappaB in cancer (P = 0.01). At a median follow-up of 32 months, 25 (53%) of 47 patients with activated NF-kappaB cancer had died versus 3 (9%) of 33 patients with negative NF-kappaB cancer. NF-kappaB activation was the only independent predictor of disease-free survival (P = 0.01) and overall survival (P = 0.007) in a multivariate model.

Detection of interval distant metastases: clinical utility of integrated CT-PET imaging in patients with esophageal carcinoma after neoadjuvant therapy.,Cancer,Cancer,2007-01-01,"The objective of the study was to determine the utility of integrated computed tomography / positron emission tomography (CT-PET) imaging for detecting interval distant metastases and assessing therapeutic response in patients with locally advanced, potentially resectable esophageal carcinoma after neoadjuvant therapy. A retrospective study was performed of 88 patients with potentially resectable esophageal carcinoma who received neoadjuvant therapy before planned surgical resection. CT-PET before and after completion of neoadjuvant was used for evaluating therapeutic response; response criteria were based on qualitative and semiquantitative analyses. Neoadjuvant therapy comprised chemoradiotherapy in 85 patients, with prior induction chemotherapy in 39 patients. Fifty-five patients proceeded to esophagectomy. Repeat CT-PET was performed after induction chemotherapy (n = 23) and after completing chemoradiotherapy (n = 85). CT-PET identified the interval appearance of metastatic disease in 7 (8%) patients.

Targeted agents and esophageal cancer--the next step?,Seminars in radiation oncology,Semin Radiat Oncol,2007-01-01,"Esophageal cancer (EC) is an aggressive cancer and is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. In the United States and Western Europe, there has been a decline in the incidence of squamous cell carcinomas coupled with a rapid rise in incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction. Although the 5-year survival rates have slowly increased over time from 4% to 14%, the outcomes are still dismal. The lack of adequate preventative strategies, inadequate screening techniques, early lymphatic and hematogenous spread, and lack of truly effective therapeutic agents all contribute to the poor outcome.

Excellent interobserver agreement on grading the extent of residual carcinoma after preoperative chemoradiation in esophageal and esophagogastric junction carcinoma: a reliable predictor for patient outcome.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2007-01-01,"The extent of residual carcinoma in resected esophageal cancer specimens after preoperative chemoradiation is a predictor of survival according to 3 groups: P0 (0% residual carcinoma), P1 (1% to 50% residual carcinoma), and P2 (>50% residual carcinoma). However, the interobserver variation and reliability of this classification has not been evaluated among different pathologists. Histologic hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides from 60 coded cases of esophageal adenocarcinomas treated with preoperative chemoradiation followed by esophagectomy were independently reviewed by 6 pathologists from 4 different institutions for extent of residual carcinoma and ypT stage. Interobserver agreement was analyzed by kappa (kappa) statistics, and grading of extent of residual carcinoma and ypT stage based on individual and consensus gradings were correlated with patients' survival. The interobserver agreement was excellent for extent of residual carcinoma (kappa=0.84, Kendall's W=0.92; P<0.000001) and was good for ypT stage (kappa=0.71, Kendall's W=0.88; P<0.000001). Agreement was excellent for all categories of residual carcinoma: P0 (kappa=0.87), P1 (kappa=0.81), and P2 (kappa=0.85). Extent of residual carcinoma was a significant predictor for overall survival based on individual pathologist grading (all P values <0.03), and consensus grading (13 P0, 32 P1, and 15 P2), P=0.004; independent of ypT and ypN stages in multivariate analysis (P=0.02). Our results indicate that after preoperative chemoradiation in esophageal cancer there is excellent interobserver agreement among pathologists on grading extent of residual carcinoma. The extent of residual carcinoma is a reliable and reproducible predictor of survival; this grading system may allow a novel and early means of comparing outcomes after different neoadjuvant treatment regimens.",Evaluation Study,4768.0,82.0,The extent of residual carcinoma in resected cancer specimens after preoperative chemoradiation is a predictor of survival according to 3 groups P0 0 residual carcinoma P1 1 to 50 residual carcinoma and P2 50 residual carcinoma However the interobserver variation and reliability of this classification has not been evaluated among different pathologists Histologic hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides from 60 coded cases of adenocarcinomas treated with preoperative chemoradiation followed by esophagectomy were independently reviewed by 6 pathologists from 4 different institutions for extent of residual carcinoma and ypT stage Interobserver agreement was analyzed by kappa kappa statistics and grading of extent of residual carcinoma and ypT stage based on individual and consensus gradings were correlated with patients survival The interobserver agreement was excellent for extent of residual carcinoma kappa=0.84 Kendall 's W=0.92 P 0.000001 and was good for ypT stage kappa=0.71 Kendall 's W=0.88 P 0.000001 Agreement was excellent for all categories of residual carcinoma P0 kappa=0.87 P1 kappa=0.81 and P2 kappa=0.85 Extent of residual carcinoma was a significant predictor for overall survival based on individual pathologist grading all P values 0.03 and consensus grading 13 P0 32 P1 and 15 P2 P=0.004 independent of ypT and ypN stages in multivariate analysis P=0.02 Our results indicate that after preoperative chemoradiation in cancer there is excellent interobserver agreement among pathologists on grading extent of residual carcinoma The extent of residual carcinoma is a reliable and reproducible predictor of survival this grading system may allow a novel and early means of comparing outcomes after different neoadjuvant treatment regimens,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[3, 1039, 1, 753, 134, 4, 1133, 12, 623, 50, 498, 975, 16, 8, 980, 1, 25, 768, 6, 27, 271, 16016, 13, 753, 134, 9538, 14, 6, 212, 753, 134, 2, 11630, 212, 753, 134, 137, 3, 5393, 1380, 2, 4217, 1, 26, 947, 71, 44, 85, 194, 107, 338, 3354, 884, 6209, 2, 5975, 3386, 3830, 29, 335, 8259, 140, 1, 1586, 73, 5, 498, 975, 370, 20, 3617, 11, 1042, 446, 20, 49, 3354, 29, 39, 338, 1764, 9, 1039, 1, 753, 134, 2, 14865, 82, 5393, 2024, 10, 311, 20, 3096, 3096, 3065, 2, 3452, 1, 1039, 1, 753, 134, 2, 14865, 82, 90, 23, 797, 2, 1391, 44581, 11, 438, 5, 7, 25, 3, 5393, 2024, 10, 1503, 9, 1039, 1, 753, 134, 3096, 13, 874, 11657, 292, 5444, 13, 937, 19, 13, 23568, 2, 10, 1178, 9, 14865, 82, 3096, 13, 792, 11657, 292, 5444, 13, 889, 19, 13, 23568, 2024, 10, 1503, 9, 62, 1996, 1, 753, 134, 16016, 3096, 13, 912, 9538, 3096, 13, 865, 2, 11630, 3096, 13, 772, 1039, 1, 753, 134, 10, 8, 93, 980, 9, 63, 25, 90, 23, 797, 5093, 3452, 62, 19, 1030, 13, 680, 2, 1391, 3452, 233, 16016, 531, 9538, 2, 167, 11630, 19, 13, 1520, 306, 1, 14865, 2, 13900, 1153, 4, 331, 65, 19, 13, 588, 114, 99, 1008, 17, 50, 498, 975, 4, 12, 125, 16, 1503, 5393, 2024, 107, 3354, 23, 3452, 1039, 1, 753, 134, 3, 1039, 1, 753, 134, 16, 8, 2450, 2, 4172, 980, 1, 25, 26, 3452, 398, 68, 1700, 8, 229, 2, 191, 2263, 1, 1430, 123, 50, 338, 536, 24, 472]",1762.0,17197919,536
Expression of epidermal growth factor receptor in esophageal and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinomas: association with poor outcome.,Cancer,Cancer,2007-02-01,"The prognosis for patients with esophageal and esophagogastric junction (EGJ) adenocarcinoma remains poor, even after surgical resection. Pathologic assessment of depth of invasion and lymph node status are the primary prognostic factors in these patients. In patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression has been associated with a worse prognosis. It is not known whether EGFR plays a similar role in esophageal and EGJ adenocarcinomas. To address this issue, the authors studied tumor specimens from 103 patients with surgically resected esophageal and EGJ adenocarcinomas (9 patients with stage I disease, 23 patients with stage II disease, 57 patients with stage III disease, and 14 patients with stage IV disease). The expression of EGFR was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays. Tumors were considered positive for EGFR expression when >5% of tumor cells were stained and negative when <or=5% of tumor cells were stained. EGFR was expressed in 33 of 103 adenocarcinomas (32%) and was correlated with higher pathologic tumor (T) classification (P = .02), the presence of lymph node metastasis (P = .01), and higher pathologic tumor, lymph node, metastasis classification (P = .02). EGFR expression also was correlated with shorter disease-free and overall survival in univariate analyses (P = .001 and P = .004, respectively), and there was a trend toward a correlation between EGFR expression and shorter disease-free survival in multivariate analyses (P = .07 and P = .08). The results demonstrated that EGFR expression in esophageal adenocarcinomas was correlated with advanced pathologic tumor classification and lymph node metastasis. EGFR expression also was correlated with poor disease-free and overall survival, but that correlation was not independent of T classification. The current findings suggested that EGFR expression correlates with poor prognostic factors and may be used to predict patient outcomes.",Journal Article,4737.0,166.0,The prognosis for patients with and esophagogastric junction EGJ adenocarcinoma remains poor even after surgical resection Pathologic assessment of depth of invasion and lymph node status are the primary prognostic factors in these patients In patients with squamous cell carcinoma increased epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR expression has been associated with a worse prognosis It is not known whether EGFR plays a similar role in and EGJ adenocarcinomas To address this issue the authors studied tumor specimens from 103 patients with surgically resected and EGJ adenocarcinomas 9 patients with stage I disease 23 patients with stage II disease 57 patients with stage III disease and 14 patients with stage IV disease The expression of EGFR was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays Tumors were considered positive for EGFR expression when 5 of tumor cells were stained and negative when or=5 of tumor cells were stained EGFR was expressed in 33 of 103 adenocarcinomas 32 and was correlated with higher pathologic tumor T classification P .02 the presence of lymph node metastasis P .01 and higher pathologic tumor lymph node metastasis classification P .02 EGFR expression also was correlated with shorter disease-free and overall survival in univariate analyses P .001 and P .004 respectively and there was a trend toward a correlation between EGFR expression and shorter disease-free survival in multivariate analyses P .07 and P .08 The results demonstrated that EGFR expression in adenocarcinomas was correlated with advanced pathologic tumor classification and lymph node metastasis EGFR expression also was correlated with poor disease-free and overall survival but that correlation was not independent of T classification The current findings suggested that EGFR expression correlates with poor prognostic factors and may be used to predict patient outcomes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[3, 356, 9, 7, 5, 2, 6330, 3322, 12191, 449, 469, 334, 871, 50, 221, 170, 510, 455, 1, 2436, 1, 578, 2, 263, 289, 156, 32, 3, 86, 177, 130, 4, 46, 7, 4, 7, 5, 691, 31, 134, 101, 829, 129, 161, 153, 227, 55, 71, 85, 41, 5, 8, 639, 356, 192, 16, 44, 440, 317, 227, 1698, 8, 288, 200, 4, 2, 12191, 1586, 6, 1539, 26, 2537, 3, 738, 656, 30, 623, 29, 3283, 7, 5, 2350, 1133, 2, 12191, 1586, 83, 7, 5, 82, 70, 34, 382, 7, 5, 82, 215, 34, 696, 7, 5, 82, 316, 34, 2, 213, 7, 5, 82, 478, 34, 3, 55, 1, 227, 10, 275, 20, 1382, 65, 1, 246, 2774, 57, 11, 515, 109, 9, 227, 55, 198, 33, 1, 30, 37, 11, 3386, 2, 199, 198, 15, 33, 1, 30, 37, 11, 3386, 227, 10, 570, 4, 466, 1, 3283, 1586, 531, 2, 10, 438, 5, 142, 510, 30, 102, 947, 19, 588, 3, 463, 1, 263, 289, 278, 19, 355, 2, 142, 510, 30, 263, 289, 278, 947, 19, 588, 227, 55, 120, 10, 438, 5, 985, 34, 115, 2, 63, 25, 4, 880, 318, 19, 144, 2, 19, 1520, 106, 2, 125, 10, 8, 853, 1317, 8, 816, 59, 227, 55, 2, 985, 34, 115, 25, 4, 331, 318, 19, 1615, 2, 19, 1592, 3, 99, 264, 17, 227, 55, 4, 1586, 10, 438, 5, 131, 510, 30, 947, 2, 263, 289, 278, 227, 55, 120, 10, 438, 5, 334, 34, 115, 2, 63, 25, 84, 17, 816, 10, 44, 306, 1, 102, 947, 3, 291, 272, 1148, 17, 227, 55, 1871, 5, 334, 177, 130, 2, 68, 40, 95, 6, 678, 69, 123]",1897.0,17211865,183
Radio(chemo)therapy plus resection versus radio(chemo)therapy alone for the treatment of stage III esophageal cancer.,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ... [et al],Strahlenther Onkol,2007-01-01,"To compare radio(chemo)therapy with 41.4-50.4 Gy (moderate dose, MD-RCT) plus resection versus radio(chemo)therapy with 59.4-66.6 Gy (higher dose, HD-RCT) alone for outcome in stage III esophageal cancer, and to investigate potential prognostic factors including preradiotherapy (pre-RT) hemoglobin. 148 patients with stage III esophageal cancer, treated with MD-RCT plus resection (n = 41) or HD-RCT alone (n = 107), were retrospectively evaluated for age, gender, performance status, tumor location, tumor length, stage, histology, grading, number of chemotherapy courses, pre-RT hemoglobin, resection, overall survival (OS), metastases-free survival (MFS), and locoregional control (LC). On univariate analysis, MD-RCT plus resection resulted in better 2-year OS (57% vs. 25%; p = 0.049), 2-year MFS (71% vs. 39%; p = 0.041), and 2-year LC (76% vs. 39%; p = 0.003). On multivariate analysis, results maintained significance for LC (p = 0.021). According to multivariate analysis, pre-RT hemoglobin was associated with OS (p = 0.003), MFS (p = 0.043), and LC (p = 0.041), tumor length with OS (p = 0.002) and MFS (p = 0.017), and the number of chemotherapy courses with OS (p = 0.008). Complications were more frequent in the MD-RCT-plus-surgery group (p < 0.001). Acute (p = 0.47) and late toxicity (p = 0.86) were similar in both groups.

Cancer Res.,2007-01-01,"The primary objective of this phase I study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose for pemetrexed, alone and in combination with carboplatin, with concurrent radiotherapy. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or esophageal cancer were treated every 21 days for two cycles. Regimen 1 was pemetrexed (200-600 mg/m(2)); regimen 2 was pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2)) with escalating carboplatin doses (AUC = 4-6). Both regimens included concurrent radiation (40-66 Gy; palliative-intent doses were lower). Thirty patients (18 locally advanced and 12 metastatic with dominant local symptoms) were enrolled, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0/1/2 (n = 8/21/1). All dose levels were tolerable for regimen 1 (n = 18: 15 NSCLC and 3 esophageal cancers) and regimen 2 (n = 12: all NSCLC). In regimen 1, one dose-limiting toxicity (grade 4 esophagitis/anorexia) occurred (500 mg/m(2)). Grade 3 neutropenia (3 of 18 patients) was the main hematologic toxicity. In regimen 2, one dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 esophagitis) occurred (500 mg/m(2); AUC = 6); grade 3/4 leukopenia (4 of 12 patients) was the main hematologic toxicity. Four complete responses (2 pathology proven) and eight partial responses were observed. When systemically active chemotherapy doses were reached, further dose escalation was discontinued, and a phase II dose-range was established (pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) and carboplatin AUC = 5-6). The combination of pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2)) and carboplatin (AUC = 5 or 6) with concurrent radiation is well tolerated, allows for the administration of systemically active chemotherapy doses, and shows signs of activity.

Decreased expression of gene cluster at chromosome 1q21 defines molecular subgroups of chemoradiotherapy response in esophageal cancers.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2007-02-01,"Resistance to preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CTXRT) in 75% of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) underscores the need for identification of biomarkers of CTXRT response. We previously noted an association between decreased expression of epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) genes S100A2 and SPRR3 at chromosome 1q21 and CTXRT resistance. In the current study, we did an in-depth investigation of the expression of 1q21-1q25 region genes to uncover the role of the EDC and its flanking genes in CTXRT response. We compared 19 pretreatment EAC specimens with normal squamous mucosa for the expression of 517 genes at chromosome 1q21-1q25 and selected target genes based on their differential expression. Using the pathologic complete-response (pathCR) status of the resected specimens as a representation of CTXRT sensitivity, we assessed the association between the expression of target genes and CTXRT response and clinical outcomes. On the basis of the expression levels of IVL, CRNN, NICE-1, S100A2, and SPPR3, genes within and in close proximity to the EDC, cancers were segregated into high (subgroup I) or low (subgroup II) expressers. Four of the five pathCRs were high expressers. Thus, low expressers, with one exception, were all nonresponders. Patients in subgroup I also had longer survival than those in subgroup II, although this result was not statistically significant owing to the small study number. The expression levels of genes mapping within and close to the EDC define CTXRT response subgroups in EACs.",Journal Article,4737.0,34.0,Resistance to preoperative chemoradiotherapy CTXRT in 75 of patients with adenocarcinoma EAC underscores the need for identification of biomarkers of CTXRT response We previously noted an association between decreased expression of epidermal differentiation complex EDC genes S100A2 and SPRR3 at chromosome 1q21 and CTXRT resistance In the current study we did an in-depth investigation of the expression of 1q21-1q25 region genes to uncover the role of the EDC and its flanking genes in CTXRT response We compared 19 pretreatment EAC specimens with normal squamous mucosa for the expression of 517 genes at chromosome 1q21-1q25 and selected target genes based on their differential expression Using the pathologic complete-response pathCR status of the resected specimens as a representation of CTXRT sensitivity we assessed the association between the expression of target genes and CTXRT response and clinical outcomes On the basis of the expression levels of IVL CRNN NICE-1 S100A2 and SPPR3 genes within and in close proximity to the EDC cancers were segregated into high subgroup I or low subgroup II expressers Four of the five pathCRs were high expressers Thus low expressers with one exception were all nonresponders Patients in subgroup I also had longer survival than those in subgroup II although this result was not statistically significant owing to the small study number The expression levels of genes mapping within and close to the EDC define CTXRT response subgroups in EACs,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[251, 6, 498, 1464, 20543, 4, 481, 1, 7, 5, 449, 3378, 6926, 3, 594, 9, 911, 1, 582, 1, 20543, 51, 21, 373, 1051, 35, 248, 59, 340, 55, 1, 829, 910, 840, 16450, 214, 20482, 2, 33873, 28, 1170, 11232, 2, 20543, 251, 4, 3, 291, 45, 21, 205, 35, 4, 2436, 940, 1, 3, 55, 1, 11232, 30642, 1053, 214, 6, 6281, 3, 200, 1, 3, 16450, 2, 211, 12472, 214, 4, 20543, 51, 21, 72, 326, 1194, 3378, 623, 5, 295, 691, 2713, 9, 3, 55, 1, 11100, 214, 28, 1170, 11232, 30642, 2, 715, 283, 214, 90, 23, 136, 1777, 55, 75, 3, 510, 236, 51, 6520, 156, 1, 3, 1133, 623, 22, 8, 7768, 1, 20543, 485, 21, 275, 3, 248, 59, 3, 55, 1, 283, 214, 2, 20543, 51, 2, 38, 123, 23, 3, 877, 1, 3, 55, 148, 1, 31056, 56056, 28642, 14, 20482, 2, 56057, 214, 262, 2, 4, 2336, 6167, 6, 3, 16450, 163, 11, 11324, 237, 64, 1363, 70, 15, 154, 1363, 215, 11791, 294, 1, 3, 365, 44618, 11, 64, 11791, 631, 154, 11791, 5, 104, 4188, 11, 62, 4498, 7, 4, 1363, 70, 120, 42, 589, 25, 76, 135, 4, 1363, 215, 242, 26, 757, 10, 44, 712, 93, 3421, 6, 3, 302, 45, 207, 3, 55, 148, 1, 214, 2568, 262, 2, 2336, 6, 3, 16450, 1107, 20543, 51, 1453, 4, 15338]",1493.0,17289885,89
American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system does not accurately predict survival in patients receiving multimodality therapy for esophageal adenocarcinoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2007-02-01,"In patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus who receive preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT), American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, pathologic complete response (pCR), and estimated treatment response are various means used to stratify patients prognostically after surgery. However, none of these methods has been formally evaluated. The purpose of this study was to establish prognostic pathologic variables after CRT. A retrospective review was performed of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma who received CRT before esophagectomy. Data collected included demographics, CRT details, pathologic findings, and survival. Statistical methods included recursive partitioning and Kaplan-Meier analyses. Two hundred seventy-six patients were appropriate for this analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicates that the current AJCC system poorly distinguishes between stages 0 to IIA (P = .52), IIB to III (P = .87), and IVA to IVB (P = .30). The presence of a pCR conferred improved survival over residual disease (P = .01). Recursive partitioning analysis indicates that involved lymph nodes and metastatic disease are the best predictors of survival and that depth of invasion and degree of treatment response are less predictive. The current AJCC staging system is not a good predictor of survival after CRT. Although patients with a pCR do have improved long-term survival relative to patients with residual disease, this method places too much emphasis on residual depth of invasion and fails to identify patients with residual disease who have good long-term survival.

Cyclin D1 guanine/adenine 870 polymorphism with altered protein expression is associated with genomic instability and aggressive clinical biology of esophageal adenocarcinoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2007-02-01,"Altered cyclin D1 (CD1), a cell cycle regulator, may play an important role in imparting aggressive nature to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). CD1 gene single nucleotide polymorphism G/A870 results in two alternatively spliced transcripts, CD1a and CD1b. CD1b, preferentially encoded by the A870 allele, is putatively oncogenic. We hypothesized that CD1 A870 allele would be associated with higher CD1 protein expression, and increased genomic instability during EAC evolution, leading to more aggressive phenotype. One hundred twenty-four archival specimens of EAC, and 39 associated Barrett's esophagus (BE) specimens were examined for CD1 genotype, CD1 protein expression, and chromosome 9 polysomy (representing genomic instability). We correlated CD1 genotypes with CD1 protein expression, genomic instability, age at diagnosis of EAC, and overall survival (OS). The A870 allele was associated with higher levels of CD1 protein expression in EAC (P = .032); in BE (P = .01) where it was associated with concomitant increased chromosome 9 polysomy (P = .002); and with a younger age at diagnosis (P < .001) and poor OS (P = .0003) of EAC patients. Our data suggest that CD1 A870 background may be imparting aggressive phenotype to EAC. It provides a molecular basis to explain the clinical biology associated with CD1 polymorphism whereas aberrant nuclear accumulation of CD1 protein enhances the acquisition of genomic instability (ie, clonal diversity), thus leading to early age of EAC diagnosis and poor OS.

The utility of positron emission tomography in staging of potentially operable carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus: results of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0060 trial.,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg.,2007-03-01,"The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group trial Z0060 is a prospective multi-institutional trial with a primary objective to evaluate whether positron emission tomography (PET) with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) detects evidence of metastastic disease that precludes esophagectomy in patients with esophageal cancer who are surgical candidates after routine staging. Patients with resectable, biopsy-proven carcinoma were enrolled after computed tomography of chest and abdomen demonstrated no evidence of metastasis. FDG-PET was performed according to specified standards. FDG-PET findings suggesting metastases required confirmation and patients without metastases on PET were expected to proceed to surgery. A total of 262 patients were registered. Of these, 199 were deemed eligible and of these, 189 patients were evaluable. Seventy-three patients were ineligible or unevaluable. Reasons for ineligibility included nonresectable disease by routine staging (39), missing or outdated staging procedures (12), PET technical protocol violations (10), no cancer (4), pre-PET induction therapy (3), claustrophobia (1), and other causes (4). There were 145 (78%) patients who went on to have surgery, 42 (22%) who did not, and 2 patients for whom the surgical status was not determined. The reasons for no resection included the following: M1 disease found by PET and confirmed (9), M1 disease found by PET and not confirmed (2), M1 disease at exploration not found by PET (7), decline or death before surgery (10), patient refusal of surgery (7), unresectable local tumor at exploration (5), and extensive N1 disease precluding operation (2). Eight (4.2%) patients undergoing resection had a recurrence in the first 6 months.

Secondary chemoprevention of Barrett's esophagus with celecoxib: results of a randomized trial.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2007-04-01,"Barrett's esophagus is a premalignant condition that is a risk factor for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma, a disease whose incidence is rapidly increasing. Because aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as celecoxib, may decrease the risk of developing esophageal cancer, we investigated the effect of long-term administration of celecoxib in patients with Barrett's esophagus with dysplasia. Chemoprevention for Barrett's Esophagus Trial (CBET) is a phase IIb multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial of celecoxib in patients with Barrett's esophagus and low- or high-grade dysplasia. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with 200 mg of celecoxib or placebo, both administered orally twice daily, and then stratified by grade of dysplasia. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to 48 weeks of treatment in the proportion of biopsy samples with dysplasia between the celecoxib and placebo arms. Secondary and tertiary outcomes included evaluation of changes in histology and expression levels of relevant biomarkers. All statistical tests were two-sided. From April 1, 2000, through June 30, 2003, 222 patients were registered into CBET, and 100 of them with low- or high-grade Barrett's dysplasia were randomly assigned to treatment (49 to celecoxib and 51 to placebo). After 48 weeks of treatment, no difference was observed in the median change in the proportion of biopsy samples with dysplasia or cancer between treatment groups in either the low-grade (median change with celecoxib = -0.09, interquartile range [IQR] = -0.32 to 0.14 and with placebo = -0.07, IQR = -0.26 to 0.12; P = .64) or high-grade (median change with celecoxib = 0.12, IQR = -0.31 to 0.55, and with placebo = 0.02, IQR = -0.24 to 0.28; P = .88) stratum. No statistically significant differences in total surface area of the Barrett's esophagus; in prostaglandin levels; in cyclooxygenase-1/2 mRNA levels; or in methylation of tumor suppressor genes p16, adenomatous polyposis coli, and E-cadherin were found with celecoxib compared with placebo. Administration of 200 mg of celecoxib twice daily for 48 weeks of treatment does not appear to prevent progression of Barrett's dysplasia to cancer.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",4678.0,130.0,Barrett 's is a premalignant condition that is a risk factor for the development of adenocarcinoma a disease whose incidence is rapidly increasing Because aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as celecoxib may decrease the risk of developing cancer we investigated the effect of long-term administration of celecoxib in patients with Barrett 's with dysplasia Chemoprevention for Barrett 's Trial CBET is a phase IIb multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial of celecoxib in patients with Barrett 's and low- or high-grade dysplasia Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with 200 mg of celecoxib or placebo both administered orally twice daily and then stratified by grade of dysplasia The primary outcome was the change from baseline to 48 weeks of treatment in the proportion of biopsy samples with dysplasia between the celecoxib and placebo arms Secondary and tertiary outcomes included evaluation of changes in histology and expression levels of relevant biomarkers All statistical tests were two-sided From April 1 2000 through June 30 2003 222 patients were registered into CBET and 100 of them with low- or high-grade Barrett 's dysplasia were randomly assigned to treatment 49 to celecoxib and 51 to placebo After 48 weeks of treatment no difference was observed in the median change in the proportion of biopsy samples with dysplasia or cancer between treatment groups in either the low-grade median change with celecoxib -0.09 interquartile range IQR -0.32 to 0.14 and with placebo -0.07 IQR -0.26 to 0.12 P .64 or high-grade median change with celecoxib 0.12 IQR -0.31 to 0.55 and with placebo 0.02 IQR -0.24 to 0.28 P .88 stratum No statistically significant differences in total surface area of the Barrett 's in prostaglandin levels in cyclooxygenase-1/2 mRNA levels or in methylation of tumor suppressor genes p16 adenomatous polyposis coli and E-cadherin were found with celecoxib compared with placebo Administration of 200 mg of celecoxib twice daily for 48 weeks of treatment does not appear to prevent progression of Barrett 's dysplasia to cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[4366, 292, 16, 8, 4343, 2850, 17, 16, 8, 43, 161, 9, 3, 193, 1, 449, 8, 34, 1310, 287, 16, 1755, 602, 408, 2085, 2, 127, 4960, 312, 1291, 600, 225, 22, 2673, 68, 775, 3, 43, 1, 931, 12, 21, 565, 3, 254, 1, 319, 337, 634, 1, 2673, 4, 7, 5, 4366, 292, 5, 2253, 2886, 9, 4366, 292, 160, 31080, 16, 8, 124, 3884, 1570, 384, 619, 1149, 160, 1, 2673, 4, 7, 5, 4366, 292, 2, 154, 15, 64, 88, 2253, 7, 11, 1108, 896, 6, 24, 5, 1250, 81, 1, 2673, 15, 619, 110, 468, 1428, 936, 391, 2, 818, 1173, 20, 88, 1, 2253, 3, 86, 228, 10, 3, 707, 29, 330, 6, 576, 244, 1, 24, 4, 3, 920, 1, 411, 347, 5, 2253, 59, 3, 2673, 2, 619, 1335, 568, 2, 2557, 123, 159, 451, 1, 400, 4, 784, 2, 55, 148, 1, 867, 582, 62, 1050, 895, 11, 100, 1689, 29, 2292, 14, 1081, 298, 1924, 201, 1522, 5647, 7, 11, 1653, 237, 31080, 2, 394, 1, 1370, 5, 154, 15, 64, 88, 4366, 292, 2253, 11, 1108, 896, 6, 24, 739, 6, 2673, 2, 725, 6, 619, 50, 576, 244, 1, 24, 77, 523, 10, 164, 4, 3, 52, 707, 4, 3, 920, 1, 411, 347, 5, 2253, 15, 12, 59, 24, 271, 4, 361, 3, 154, 88, 52, 707, 5, 2673, 13, 1730, 2899, 184, 2245, 13, 531, 6, 13, 213, 2, 5, 619, 13, 1615, 2245, 13, 432, 6, 13, 133, 19, 660, 15, 64, 88, 52, 707, 5, 2673, 13, 133, 2245, 13, 456, 6, 13, 614, 2, 5, 619, 13, 588, 2245, 13, 259, 6, 13, 339, 19, 889, 4897, 77, 712, 93, 362, 4, 181, 1255, 965, 1, 3, 4366, 292, 4, 6068, 148, 4, 4043, 14, 18, 956, 148, 15, 4, 569, 1, 30, 1245, 214, 1932, 4865, 4198, 6959, 2, 563, 2154, 11, 204, 5, 2673, 72, 5, 619, 634, 1, 1250, 81, 1, 2673, 936, 391, 9, 576, 244, 1, 24, 1097, 44, 1322, 6, 1682, 91, 1, 4366, 292, 2253, 6, 12]",2103.0,17405999,628
Esophageal cancer located at the neck and upper thorax treated with concurrent chemoradiation: a single-institution experience.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2006-03-01,"To characterize the treatment and outcome of patients with cervical and upper thoracic esophageal cancer, the authors retrospectively reviewed the 11-year experience from The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Thirty-five patients with M0 cervical or upper thoracic esophageal cancer and treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy were analyzed. Median radiation dose was 50.4 Gy (range, 24.5-64.8) Gy delivered with 1.8-Gy daily fractions over 5.5 weeks. Chemotherapy was 5-fluorouracil based. Response after treatment was evaluated on the basis of radiography, biopsy, or both. The survival rates were calculated by means of the Kaplan-Meier method. The median follow-up for the surviving patients was 39 months. The actuarial 5-year overall survival (OS), cause-specific survival, disease-free survival, local relapse-free survival, and distant metastasis-free survival rates were 18.6%, 27.6%, 22.4%, 47.7%, and 57.0%, respectively. Patients who received a radiation dose of greater than or equal to 50 Gy had a higher complete response rate than those who received less than 50 Gy (79.2% versus 27.3%; p = 0.003). On multivariate analysis, radiation dose was the only protective factor associated with the rates of OS (p = 0.006), cause-specific survival (p = 0.003), and local relapse-free survival (p = 0.001); tumor stage was the only factor associated with rate of disease-free survival (p = 0.007).

Preoperative chemo-radiation-induced ulceration in patients with esophageal cancer: a confounding factor in tumor response assessment in integrated computed tomographic-positron emission tomographic imaging.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2006-06-01,"Positron emission tomography can be useful in predicting response of esophageal cancer after preoperative chemo-radiation therapy (CRT). We evaluated the use of integrated computed tomography (CT)-PET among patients with esophageal cancer being considered for resection after CRT. Three reviewers blinded to clinical and pathologic staging retrospectively reviewed the CT-PET scans of patients with esophageal cancer after preoperative CRT who underwent esophagectomy. [F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake for residual malignancy was determined by visual analysis and semi-quantitatively when standardized uptake value (SUV) was > or =4. Forty-two patients underwent esophageal resection. Using visual analysis, CT-PET had a sensitivity of 47% and specificity of 58% in detecting residual malignancy. Using semi-quantitative analysis, 19 patients had a SUV > or =4 in the region of the primary esophageal tumor and were interpreted as having residual malignancy (sensitivity 43%, specificity 50%). Of these 19, six had complete pathologic response to CRT. These false-positive results, due to therapy-induced ulceration detected at endoscopy, limit the use of CT-PET alone in detecting residual malignancy. Similarly, sensitivity (25%) and specificity (73%) of endoscopy/biopsy in detecting residual malignancy were poor. However, the accuracy of CT-PET in detecting residual malignancy was improved when combined with endoscopic findings.

A phase II trial of accelerated multimodality therapy for locoregionally advanced cancer of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction: the impact of clinical heterogeneity.,American journal of clinical oncology,Am. J. Clin. Oncol.,2007-04-01,"This is a report of mature results from a phase II trial of an accelerated multimodality treatment program for locoregionally advanced cancer of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction with a focus on the impact of clinical heterogeneity on outcomes. A split course of pre- and postoperative hyperfractionated radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy was used in an effort to limit perioperative mortality. Eligibility required a diagnosis of esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer and an esophageal ultrasound stage of at least T3, N1, or M1A. Patients received a 12-day induction course of radiation (1.5 Gy twice a dose to a dose of 30 Gy) concurrent with 4-day continuous intravenous infusions of cisplatin (20 mg/m2 per day) and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 per day) beginning on day 1. Surgery followed in 4 to 6 weeks followed 6 to 10 weeks later by a second, identical course of chemoradiotherapy. From October 1999 through March 2003, 93 patients were enrolled; 96% were white, 86% male, and 83% had adenocarcinoma. Resection was possible in 83 patients (89%) with 4 (5%) perioperative deaths. With a median follow up of 50 months (range, 34-72 months), the 3-year projected overall survival rate is 27.9%, freedom from recurrence 30.5%, and distant metastatic control 32.4%. Locoregional control in resected patients is 86%. Freedom from recurrence and distant control were significantly better in patients with 1) earlier pretreatment clinical stage, 2) earlier postinduction pathologic stage, 3) squamous cell cancer, and 4) a pathologic response. This accelerated multimodality treatment program is feasible and perioperative mortality proved acceptable. Despite excellent locoregional control, freedom from recurrence, and overall survival proved disappointing reflecting the frequency of distant metastases. Heterogeneity in patient populations makes comparisons with similar nonrandomized experiences problematic.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",4678.0,17.0,This is a report of mature results from a phase II trial of an accelerated multimodality treatment program for locoregionally advanced cancer of the and gastroesophageal junction with a focus on the impact of clinical heterogeneity on outcomes A split course of pre- and postoperative hyperfractionated radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy was used in an effort to limit perioperative mortality Eligibility required a diagnosis of or gastroesophageal junction cancer and an ultrasound stage of at least T3 N1 or M1A Patients received a 12-day induction course of radiation 1.5 Gy twice a dose to a dose of 30 Gy concurrent with 4-day continuous intravenous infusions of cisplatin 20 mg/m2 per day and 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2 per day beginning on day 1 Surgery followed in 4 to 6 weeks followed 6 to 10 weeks later by a second identical course of chemoradiotherapy From October 1999 through March 2003 93 patients were enrolled 96 were white 86 male and 83 had adenocarcinoma Resection was possible in 83 patients 89 with 4 5 perioperative deaths With a median follow up of 50 months range 34-72 months the 3-year projected overall survival rate is 27.9 freedom from recurrence 30.5 and distant metastatic control 32.4 Locoregional control in resected patients is 86 Freedom from recurrence and distant control were significantly better in patients with 1 earlier pretreatment clinical stage 2 earlier postinduction pathologic stage 3 squamous cell cancer and 4 a pathologic response This accelerated multimodality treatment program is feasible and perioperative mortality proved acceptable Despite excellent locoregional control freedom from recurrence and overall survival proved disappointing reflecting the frequency of distant metastases Heterogeneity in patient populations makes comparisons with similar nonrandomized experiences problematic,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[26, 16, 8, 414, 1, 2908, 99, 29, 8, 124, 215, 160, 1, 35, 2241, 2425, 24, 1243, 9, 6410, 131, 12, 1, 3, 2, 3227, 3322, 5, 8, 1222, 23, 3, 345, 1, 38, 1144, 23, 123, 8, 6240, 906, 1, 671, 2, 573, 6201, 121, 36, 2, 750, 56, 10, 95, 4, 35, 2919, 6, 2385, 1547, 282, 2317, 616, 8, 147, 1, 15, 3227, 3322, 12, 2, 35, 1945, 82, 1, 28, 506, 2065, 3192, 15, 10866, 7, 103, 8, 133, 218, 504, 906, 1, 121, 14, 33, 381, 936, 8, 61, 6, 8, 61, 1, 201, 381, 750, 5, 39, 218, 1314, 1262, 3435, 1, 540, 179, 81, 821, 379, 218, 2, 33, 1404, 2345, 81, 821, 379, 218, 2948, 23, 218, 14, 152, 370, 4, 39, 6, 49, 244, 370, 49, 6, 79, 244, 1559, 20, 8, 419, 3038, 906, 1, 1464, 29, 2551, 2043, 298, 2363, 1522, 966, 7, 11, 346, 921, 11, 886, 868, 1045, 2, 852, 42, 449, 170, 10, 899, 4, 852, 7, 887, 5, 39, 33, 1547, 1043, 5, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 212, 53, 184, 562, 720, 53, 3, 27, 111, 5633, 63, 25, 116, 16, 428, 83, 3060, 29, 146, 201, 33, 2, 626, 113, 182, 531, 39, 1325, 182, 4, 1133, 7, 16, 868, 3060, 29, 146, 2, 626, 182, 11, 97, 380, 4, 7, 5, 14, 1677, 1194, 38, 82, 18, 1677, 12543, 510, 82, 27, 691, 31, 12, 2, 39, 8, 510, 51, 26, 2241, 2425, 24, 1243, 16, 1313, 2, 1547, 282, 4328, 1595, 550, 1503, 1325, 182, 3060, 29, 146, 2, 63, 25, 4328, 5964, 4777, 3, 675, 1, 626, 196, 1144, 4, 69, 1184, 4677, 2213, 5, 288, 5666, 4031, 6594]",1858.0,17414467,16

Photodynamic therapy for Barrett's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia: a cost-effectiveness analysis.,Canadian journal of gastroenterology = Journal canadien de gastroenterologie,Can. J. Gastroenterol.,2007-04-01,"To assess the cost-effectiveness of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and esophagectomy (ESO) relative to surveillance (SURV) for patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) and high-grade dysplasia (HGD). A Markov decision tree was constructed to estimate costs and health outcomes of PDT, ESO and SURV in a hypothetical cohort of male patients, 50 years of age, with BE and HGD. Outcomes included unadjusted life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs). Direct medical costs (2003 CDN$) were measured from the perspective of a provincial ministry of health. The time horizon for the model was five years (cycle length three months), and costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%. Model parameters were assigned unique distributions, and a probabilistic analysis with 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations was performed. SURV was the least costly strategy, followed by PDT and ESO, but SURV was also the least effective. In terms of LYs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 814 dollars/LY for PDT versus SURV and 3,397 dollars/LY for ESO versus PDT. PDT dominated ESO for QALYs in the base-case. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of PDT versus SURV was 879 dollars/QALY. In probabilistic analysis, PDT was most likely to be cost-effective at willingness-to-pay (WTP) values between 100 dollars/LY and 3,500 dollars/LY, and ESO was most likely to be cost-effective for WTP values over 3500 dollars/LY. For quality-adjusted survival, PDT was most likely to be cost-effective for all WTP thresholds above 1,000 dollars/QALY. The likelihood that PDT was the most cost-effective strategy reached 0.99 at a WTP ceiling of 25,000 dollars/QALY.

Molecular mechanisms in Barrett's metaplasia and its progression.,Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2007-04-01,"The dramatic increase in the incidence and poor overall survival rates of esophageal/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma underscore the necessity to discover molecular markers that can be used for risk assessment, early diagnosis, and targeted therapeutic intervention. Barrett's esophagus (BE) is proposed to represent a precursor of esophageal/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. BE progression to invasive cancer is defined by a metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma progression characterized by an increasing accumulation of genetic changes associated with alterations in molecular gatekeepers of cell circuitries and tissue homeostasis. Using a combination of in situ tissue-based and high-throughput analyses, we investigated alterations of cell-cycle regulators and inflammation-associated molecular effectors.

Propensity-matched analysis of three techniques for intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2007-05-01,"A cervical side-to-side stapled esophagogastric anastomosis appears to decrease morbidity compared with traditional hand-sewn techniques. We evaluated our experience with this novel technique in intrathoracic anastomoses and compared the outcome with circular-stapled or hand-sewn techniques. All patients undergoing transthoracic esophagectomy from 1999 to 2005 for esophageal cancer with gastric replacement were reviewed. A prospective quality improvement database, telephone interview, and chart review were used to collect data. A side-to-side stapled anastomosis was done in 44 patients, circular-stapled anastomosis in 147, and hand-sewn anastomosis in 23. Propensity scores were generated from 14 variables, which were then used to generate 23 patient triplets. End points included leak, dysphagia, stricture, other major complications, and overall survival. Follow-up was available on all patients. For matched triplet comparison, no significant difference was noted in anastomotic leaks (8.7% with side-to-side stapled, 4.3% with circular-stapled, and 4.3% with hand-sewn; p = 0.78). Postoperative dysphagia was significantly higher in hand-sewn anastomoses at 56.5% versus 26.1% with side-to-side stapled and 21.7% with circular-stapled (p = 0.04). Stricture requiring esophageal dilation was also increased in hand-sewn at 34.8% versus 8.7% with side-to-side stapled and 8.7% with circular-stapled (p = 0.04). No difference was noted in perioperative mortality, long-term survival, or locoregional recurrences between techniques. In this carefully matched group of patients, intrathoracic use of the side-to-side stapled esophagogastric anastomosis in esophageal cancer patients is safe and effective. Postoperative dysphagia and need for stricture dilation may be decreased using a stapled compared with a traditional hand-sewn anastomosis.",Comparative Study,4648.0,59.0,A side-to-side stapled esophagogastric anastomosis appears to decrease morbidity compared with traditional hand-sewn techniques We evaluated our experience with this novel technique in intrathoracic anastomoses and compared the outcome with circular-stapled or hand-sewn techniques All patients undergoing transthoracic esophagectomy from 1999 to 2005 for cancer with replacement were reviewed A prospective quality improvement database telephone interview and chart review were used to collect data A side-to-side stapled anastomosis was done in 44 patients circular-stapled anastomosis in 147 and hand-sewn anastomosis in 23 Propensity scores were generated from 14 variables which were then used to generate 23 patient triplets End points included leak dysphagia stricture other major complications and overall survival Follow-up was available on all patients For matched triplet comparison no significant difference was noted in anastomotic leaks 8.7 with side-to-side stapled 4.3 with circular-stapled and 4.3 with hand-sewn p 0.78 Postoperative dysphagia was significantly higher in hand-sewn anastomoses at 56.5 versus 26.1 with side-to-side stapled and 21.7 with circular-stapled p 0.04 Stricture requiring dilation was also increased in hand-sewn at 34.8 versus 8.7 with side-to-side stapled and 8.7 with circular-stapled p 0.04 No difference was noted in perioperative mortality long-term survival or locoregional recurrences between techniques In this carefully matched group of patients intrathoracic use of the side-to-side stapled esophagogastric anastomosis in cancer patients is safe and effective Postoperative dysphagia and need for stricture dilation may be decreased using a stapled compared with a traditional hand-sewn anastomosis,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,"[8, 1152, 6, 1152, 9911, 6330, 5519, 1233, 6, 775, 787, 72, 5, 1847, 2833, 19111, 1092, 21, 194, 114, 730, 5, 26, 229, 1312, 4, 7359, 13311, 2, 72, 3, 228, 5, 12388, 9911, 15, 2833, 19111, 1092, 62, 7, 479, 14806, 3617, 29, 2043, 6, 1242, 9, 12, 5, 3892, 11, 446, 8, 482, 372, 767, 609, 4258, 4313, 2, 2937, 206, 11, 95, 6, 6248, 74, 8, 1152, 6, 1152, 9911, 5519, 10, 1822, 4, 584, 7, 12388, 9911, 5519, 4, 4961, 2, 2833, 19111, 5519, 4, 382, 1925, 703, 11, 1419, 29, 213, 682, 92, 11, 818, 95, 6, 2562, 382, 69, 26037, 396, 862, 159, 4238, 4561, 6673, 127, 458, 521, 2, 63, 25, 166, 126, 10, 390, 23, 62, 7, 9, 655, 7706, 1155, 77, 93, 523, 10, 1051, 4, 4818, 9674, 66, 67, 5, 1152, 6, 1152, 9911, 39, 27, 5, 12388, 9911, 2, 39, 27, 5, 2833, 19111, 19, 13, 833, 573, 4561, 10, 97, 142, 4, 2833, 19111, 13311, 28, 664, 33, 185, 432, 14, 5, 1152, 6, 1152, 9911, 2, 239, 67, 5, 12388, 9911, 19, 13, 755, 6673, 1888, 8062, 10, 120, 101, 4, 2833, 19111, 28, 562, 66, 185, 66, 67, 5, 1152, 6, 1152, 9911, 2, 66, 67, 5, 12388, 9911, 19, 13, 755, 77, 523, 10, 1051, 4, 1547, 282, 319, 337, 25, 15, 1325, 1593, 59, 1092, 4, 26, 3900, 655, 87, 1, 7, 7359, 119, 1, 3, 1152, 6, 1152, 9911, 6330, 5519, 4, 12, 7, 16, 1165, 2, 323, 573, 4561, 2, 594, 9, 6673, 8062, 68, 40, 340, 75, 8, 9911, 72, 5, 8, 1847, 2833, 19111, 5519]",1752.0,17462404,402
"Concurrent oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and radiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced esophageal carcinoma.","Cancer journal (Sudbury, Mass.)",Cancer J,,"The combination of oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin with concurrent radiotherapy was demonstrated to be a safe regimen for locally advanced esophageal carcinoma in a prior phase I study. We now report the efficacy data for 42 patients treated with this regimen. Each chemotherapy cycle lasted 29 days and consisted of 5-fluorouracil, 180 mg/m2 protracted-infusion from days 1 to 29, and oxaliplatin, 85 mg/m2 on days 1, 15, and 29. The first cycle was administered concurrently with radiation. The radiation field included regional lymph nodes as well as the primary tumor or tumor bed to a dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. After concurrent chemoradiotherapy, 1 to 2 additional cycles of chemotherapy were administered. If esophagectomy was indicated, it occurred 4 weeks after completion of concurrent chemoradiotherapy. In the adjuvant group, concurrent chemoradiotherapy was initiated 4 weeks after surgery. Median age was 61 years (range 38-78 years); 30 (71%) of the patients were male. Thirty-three patients had adenocarcinoma, and 9 had squamous cell carcinoma. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy was administered preoperatively (group 1) in 24 patients, definitively (group 2) in 13 patients, and as adjuvant treatment (group 3) in 5 patients. In group 1, 16 patients were down-staged including 1 patient with minimal residual disease and 5 with a complete pathologic response; 4 patients were not down-staged, and 4 did not undergo esophagectomy (2 progressed, 1 died of unrelated causes, and 1 refused). In group 2, 1 patient had a complete clinical response, 4 others were down-staged, 2 had stable disease, and 6 progressed. Four patients in group 3 progressed. Median survival was 28 months for group 1, 12 months for group 2, and not reached at 14 months for group 3. There was one grade 4 toxicity (anaphylaxis) in group 2. Grade 3 toxicities were reported for 5 patients in group 1 and 1 patient in group 2. They consisted of hypotension (n=1), fatigue (n=2), diarrhea (n=2), neuropathy (n=1), mucositis (n=1), pneumonitis (n=1), dehydration (n=1), emesis (n=1), and weight loss (n=1).

Concurrent chemotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy for locoregionally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2007-05-09,"To perform a retrospective review of laryngeal/hypopharyngeal carcinomas treated with concurrent chemotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Between January 2002 and June 2005, 20 laryngeal and 11 hypopharyngeal carcinoma patients underwent IMRT with concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy; most patients had Stage IV disease. The prescription of the planning target volume for gross, high-risk, and low-risk subclinical disease was 70, 59.4, and 54 Gy, respectively. Acute/late toxicities were retrospectively scored using the Common Toxicity Criteria scale. The 2-year local progression-free, regional progression-free, laryngectomy-free, distant metastasis-free, and overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The median follow-up of the living patients was 26 months (range, 17-58 months). The 2-year local progression-free, regional progression-free, laryngectomy-free, distant metastasis-free, and overall survival rate was 86%, 94%, 89%, 92%, and 63%, respectively. Grade 2 mucositis or higher occurred in 48% of patients, and all experienced Grade 2 or higher pharyngitis during treatment. Xerostomia continued to decrease over time from the end of RT, with none complaining of Grade 2 toxicity at this analysis. The 2-year post-treatment percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy-dependency rate for those with hypopharyngeal and laryngeal tumors was 31% and 15%, respectively. The most severe late complications were laryngeal necrosis, necrotizing fascitis, and a carotid rupture resulting in death 3 weeks after salvage laryngectomy.

Setup variations in radiotherapy of esophageal cancer: evaluation by daily megavoltage computed tomographic localization.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2007-05-25,"To use pretreatment megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT) scans to evaluate setup variations in anterior-posterior (AP), lateral, and superior-inferior (SI) directions and rotational variations, including pitch, roll, and yaw, for esophageal cancer patients treated with helical tomotherapy. Ten patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer treated by combined chemoradiation using helical tomotherapy were selected. After patients were positioned using their skin tattoos/marks, MVCT scans were performed before every treatment and automatically registered to planning kilovoltage CT scans according to bony landmarks. Image registration data were used to adjust patient setups before treatment. A total of 250 MVCT scans were analyzed. Correlations between setup variations and body habitus, including height, weight, relative weight change, body surface area, and patient age, were evaluated. The standard deviations for systematic setup corrections in AP, lateral, and SI directions and pitch, roll, and yaw rotations were 1.5, 3.7, and 4.8 mm and 0.5 degrees, 1.2 degrees, and 0.8 degrees, respectively. The appropriate averages of random setup variations in AP, lateral, and SI directions and pitch, roll, and yaw rotations were 2.9, 5.2, and 4.4 mm, and 1.0 degrees, 1.2 degrees, and 1.1 degrees, respectively. Setup variations were stable throughout the entire course of radiotherapy in all three translational and three rotational displacements, with little change in magnitude. No significant correlations were found between setup variations and body habitus variables. Daily MVCT scans before each treatment can effectively detect setup errors and thereby reduce planning target volume (PTV) margins. This will reduce radiation dose to critical organs and may translate into lower treatment-related toxicities.",Evaluation Study,4624.0,40.0,To use pretreatment megavoltage computed tomography MVCT scans to evaluate setup variations in anterior-posterior AP lateral and superior-inferior SI directions and rotational variations including pitch roll and yaw for cancer patients treated with helical tomotherapy Ten patients with locally advanced cancer treated by combined chemoradiation using helical tomotherapy were selected After patients were positioned using their tattoos/marks MVCT scans were performed before every treatment and automatically registered to planning kilovoltage CT scans according to bony landmarks Image registration data were used to adjust patient setups before treatment A total of 250 MVCT scans were analyzed Correlations between setup variations and body habitus including height weight relative weight change body surface area and patient age were evaluated The standard deviations for systematic setup corrections in AP lateral and SI directions and pitch roll and yaw rotations were 1.5 3.7 and 4.8 mm and 0.5 degrees 1.2 degrees and 0.8 degrees respectively The appropriate averages of random setup variations in AP lateral and SI directions and pitch roll and yaw rotations were 2.9 5.2 and 4.4 mm and 1.0 degrees 1.2 degrees and 1.1 degrees respectively Setup variations were stable throughout the entire course of radiotherapy in all three translational and three rotational displacements with little change in magnitude No significant correlations were found between setup variations and body habitus variables Daily MVCT scans before each treatment can effectively detect setup errors and thereby reduce planning target volume PTV margins This will reduce radiation dose to critical organs and may translate into lower treatment-related toxicities,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[6, 119, 1194, 17688, 1220, 872, 13654, 1441, 6, 376, 4333, 2293, 4, 2882, 3028, 2517, 3855, 2, 1123, 1663, 5069, 3540, 2, 9499, 2293, 141, 17159, 18477, 2, 22381, 9, 12, 7, 73, 5, 6638, 7731, 1618, 7, 5, 795, 131, 12, 73, 20, 397, 975, 75, 6638, 7731, 11, 715, 50, 7, 11, 14240, 75, 136, 20561, 8418, 13654, 1441, 11, 173, 348, 454, 24, 2, 10111, 1653, 6, 1349, 16879, 425, 1441, 768, 6, 6552, 12092, 1482, 3169, 74, 11, 95, 6, 6611, 69, 23549, 348, 24, 8, 181, 1, 2039, 13654, 1441, 11, 311, 2553, 59, 4333, 2293, 2, 642, 23459, 141, 4594, 924, 580, 924, 707, 642, 1255, 965, 2, 69, 89, 11, 194, 3, 260, 7810, 9, 1556, 4333, 10737, 4, 2517, 3855, 2, 5069, 3540, 2, 17159, 18477, 2, 22381, 15346, 11, 14, 33, 27, 67, 2, 39, 66, 321, 2, 13, 33, 4133, 14, 18, 4133, 2, 13, 66, 4133, 106, 3, 870, 22137, 1, 2324, 4333, 2293, 4, 2517, 3855, 2, 5069, 3540, 2, 17159, 18477, 2, 22381, 15346, 11, 18, 83, 33, 18, 2, 39, 39, 321, 2, 14, 13, 4133, 14, 18, 4133, 2, 14, 14, 4133, 106, 4333, 2293, 11, 585, 2432, 3, 1797, 906, 1, 310, 4, 62, 169, 2460, 2, 169, 9499, 19808, 5, 1215, 707, 4, 3131, 77, 93, 2553, 11, 204, 59, 4333, 2293, 2, 642, 23459, 682, 391, 13654, 1441, 348, 296, 24, 122, 1856, 1426, 4333, 4612, 2, 2267, 969, 1349, 283, 433, 3303, 1012, 26, 303, 969, 121, 61, 6, 740, 2285, 2, 68, 4509, 237, 280, 24, 139, 385]",1746.0,17531399,211
Clinical biology of esophageal adenocarcinoma after surgery is influenced by nuclear factor-kappaB expression.,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev.,2007-06-01,"The expression of transcriptional factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) in untreated esophageal cancer specimens from patients who receive preoperative chemoradiation is associated with aggressive clinical biology. We hypothesized that nuclear NF-kappaB would define clinical biology even when surgery is used as primary therapy. Consecutive patients who did not receive any preoperative therapy were selected. Surgical cancer specimens were examined for nuclear NF-kappaB and correlated with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). One hundred twenty-three patients (stage I, 9%; stage II, 24%; stage III, 53%; stage IV, 15%) with adenocarcinoma who underwent surgery as primary therapy were analyzed. Most patients were men (90%) and the median age was 63 years. For all 123 patients, the median DFS was 21 months and the median OS was 28 months. Nuclear NF-kappaB was associated with shortened DFS (P = 0.001) in 123 patients but also in stage II (P = 0.03) and stage III (P = 0.04). Nuclear NF-kappaB was associated with shortened OS (P = 0.002) in 123 patients and in stage II (P = 0.04) and showed trend in stage III (P = 0.17). Numbers are too small for stages I and IV. In multivariate models, nuclear NF-kappaB was an independent predictor for both DFS and OS (P = 0.005 and P = 0.01). Our data are the first to show that NF-kappaB status significantly correlates with DFS and OS for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma undergoing surgery as primary therapy.

Liver-directed surgery for metastatic squamous cell carcinoma to the liver: results of a multi-center analysis.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2007-06-06,"The role of hepatic resection for metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) remains unknown. The current study evaluates the role of hepatic resection in patients with metastatic SCC to the liver. Between 1988 and 2006, 52 patients underwent hepatic resection of metastatic SCC at eight major cancer centers. Clinicopathologic factors were analyzed with regard to disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Primary SCC site was anal (n = 27), head/neck (n = 12), lung (n = 4), esophagus (n = 2), and other (n = 7). Treatment of primary SCC was chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy alone (n = 29), chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy + surgery (n = 15), or surgery alone (n = 8). Forty-seven patients underwent resection alone, 2 resection + radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and 3 RFA only. At last follow-up, 33 (63.5%) patients had recurred. The median time to recurrence was 9.8 months, and 5-year DFS was 18.6%. Factors associated with reduced DFS were liver tumor size > 5 cm (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.02) and positive surgical margin (HR = 2.33). The overall median survival after hepatic resection was 22.3 months and 5-year actuarial OS was 20.5%.

Adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction: influence of esophageal resection margin and operative approach on outcome.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2007-07-01,"To determine whether the length of esophageal resection or the operative approach influences outcome for patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ). While R0 resection remains the mainstay of curative treatment of patients with GEJ cancer, the optimal length of esophageal resection remains controversial. Patients with Siewert I, II, or III adenocarcinoma who underwent complete gross resection without neoadjuvant therapy were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Proximal margin lengths were recorded ex vivo as the distance from the gross tumor edge to the esophageal transection line. Operative approaches were grouped into gastrectomy (limited esophagectomy) or esophagectomy (extended esophagectomy). From 1985 through 2003, 505 patients underwent R0/R1 gastrectomy (n = 153) or esophagectomy (n = 352) without neoadjuvant treatment. There were no differences in R1 resection rate, number of nodes examined or operative mortality between gastrectomy and esophagectomy. Univariate analysis found >3.8 cm to be the ex vivo proximal margin length (approximately 5 cm in situ) most predictive of improved survival. Multivariable analysis in patients who underwent R0 resection with >or=15 lymph nodes examined (n = 275) found the number of positive lymph nodes, T stage, tumor grade, and ex vivo proximal margin length >3.8 cm to be independent prognostic factors. Subset analysis found that the benefit associated with >3.8 cm margin was limited to patients with T2 or greater tumors and <or=6 positive lymph nodes. In patients not receiving neoadjuvant therapy, the goal for patients with adenocarcinoma of the GEJ should be R0 resection including at least 15 lymph nodes, preferably with 5 cm of grossly normal in situ proximal esophagus for those with <or=6 positive lymph nodes.

Esophageal cancer: adjuvant therapy.,"Cancer journal (Sudbury, Mass.)",Cancer J,,"In the United States, esophageal cancer is an uncommon but aggressive malignancy. Prior research has focused on the incorporation of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in both the pre- and postoperative setting. Both squamous cell and adenocarcinoma histologies have been treated in trials, with adenocarcinoma now the predominant histology seen in the United States. Although preoperative chemotherapy improves survival compared with surgery alone, the addition of concurrent radiotherapy to preoperative chemotherapy improves rates of curative resection, reduces local tumor recurrence, and achieves a significant rate of pathologic complete response. Combined preoperative chemoradiotherapy is the preferred preoperative strategy for locally advanced esophageal cancers in the United States. Definitive chemoradiotherapy alone appears to be equivalent in terms of overall survival compared with chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery in squamous cancers, although the addition of surgery after chemoradiotherapy may afford superior local control of disease. Postoperatively, survival is improved with postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy in adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, if none has been delivered preoperatively.

Proposed modification of nodal status in AJCC esophageal cancer staging system.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2007-08-01,"The current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) esophageal cancer staging for nodal status is difficult to interpret and is based solely on lymph node location relative to the primary tumor's esophageal location. Recent reports suggest that the number of lymph nodes involved is also an important factor. We reviewed our esophageal experience to propose an improved nodal staging system. In all, 1,027 patients with resected esophageal cancer from 1970 to 2005 were reviewed. Lymph nodes stations were assigned according to AJCC criteria. Overall survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The impact of location, number of involved lymph nodes, and use of preoperative chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or both, was assessed. Nonregional nodal involvement (n = 17) was associated with decreased survival compared with regional (n = 441) or celiac nodal (n = 73) involvement (3-year: 0% versus 24% and 23%; p < 0.001). The number of involved lymph nodes was strongly associated with survival (3-year: 0 nodes = 63%, 1 to 3 nodes = 31%, more than 3 nodes = 13%; p < 0.001), and multivariable Cox proportional-hazards analysis suggested that the location and number of involved lymph nodes were independent predictors of survival (p < 0.001). We propose a modified nodal staging system that designates celiac nodes as regional and includes number of involved nodes: pN0, no nodes (3 years = 63%, n = 496); pN1-regional, 1 to 3 nodes (3 years = 32%, n = 292); pN2-regional, more than 3 nodes (3 years = 14%, n = 222); pN3-nonregional node (3 years = 0%, n = 17 [p < 0.0001]).

The relationship between resection type and between tumor response and outcome were also analyzed. The chemotherapy group received preoperative cisplatin plus fluorouracil. Outcome based on the type of resection (R0, R1, R2, or no resection) was evaluated. The main end point was overall survival. Disease-free survival, relapse pattern, the influence of postoperative treatment, and the relationship between response to preoperative chemotherapy and outcome were also evaluated. Two hundred sixteen patients received preoperative chemotherapy, 227 underwent immediate surgery. Fifty-nine percent of surgery only and 63% of chemotherapy plus surgery patients underwent R0 resections (P = .5137). Patients undergoing less than an R0 resection had an ominous prognosis; 32% of patients with R0 resections were alive and free of disease at 5 years, only 5% of patients undergoing an R1 resection survived for longer than 5 years. The median survival rates for patients with R1, R2, or no resections were not significantly different. While, as initially reported, there was no difference in overall survival for patients receiving perioperative chemotherapy compared with the surgery only group, patients with objective tumor regression after preoperative chemotherapy had improved survival. For patients with localized esophageal cancer, whether or not preoperative chemotherapy is administered, only an R0 resection results in substantial long-term survival.

Helical tomotherapy for radiotherapy in esophageal cancer: a preferred plan with better conformal target coverage and more homogeneous dose distribution.,Medical dosimetry : official journal of the American Association of Medical Dosimetrists,Med Dosim,2007-01-01,"We compare different radiotherapy techniques-helical tomotherapy (tomotherapy), step-and-shoot IMRT (IMRT), and 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT)-for patients with mid-distal esophageal carcinoma on the basis of dosimetric analysis. Six patients with locally advanced mid-distal esophageal carcinoma were treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery. Radiotherapy included 50 Gy to gross planning target volume (PTV) and 45 Gy to elective PTV in 25 fractions. Tomotherapy, IMRT, and 3DCRT plans were generated. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs), homogeneity index (HI), volumes of lung receiving more than 10, 15, or 20 Gy (V(10), V(15), V(20)), and volumes of heart receiving more than 30 or 45 Gy (V(30), V(45)) were determined. Statistical analysis was performed by paired t-tests. By isodose distributions and DVHs, tomotherapy plans showed sharper dose gradients, more conformal coverage, and better HI for both gross and elective PTVs compared with IMRT or 3DCRT plans. Mean V(20) of lung was significantly reduced in tomotherapy plans. However, tomotherapy and IMRT plans resulted in larger V(10) of lung compared to 3DCRT plans.

We studied 102 patients who underwent postoperative RT after radical resection for esophageal SCC (T3/4 or N1). The radiation dose was > or =50 Gy. In the extensive portal group (E group, 43 patients), the CTV encompassed the bilateral supraclavicular region, all mediastinal lymph nodes, the anastomosis site, and the left gastric and pericardial lymphatic. In the regional portal group (R group, 59 patients), the CTV was confined to tumor bed and the lymph nodes in the immediate region of the primary lesion. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were compared between the groups, and multivariate/univariate analysis for factors predicting survival was studied.

Malignant gastroparesis: pathogenesis and management of an underrecognized disorder.,The journal of supportive oncology,J Support Oncol,2007-09-01,"Gastroparesis is a disorder of the stomach caused by delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Symptoms of gastroparesis include nausea, vomiting, early satiety, bloating, and abdominal discomfort. Gastroparesis has been described as a complication of several malignancies, including gastric, pancreatic, gallbladder, esophageal, and lung cancers, as well as leiomyosarcoma. The prevalence of malignant gastroparesis (MG) is unknown, and this entity is widely underrecognized and undertreated. Diabetes mellitus is the most common identifiable cause of benign gastroparesis, ie, gastroparesis occurring in the absence of an underlying malignant pathology. In the setting of malignancy, gastroparesis may result from the cancer itself or may be a complication of its treatment with such modalities as surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. Coexisting conditions, including diabetes, hypothyroidism, and neurologic diseases, may further exacerbate MG. The pathogenesis of MG is not clearly understood at present. However, mechanisms suggested in the literature include postvagotomy syndrome, malignant infiltration of the autonomic nervous system, and paraneoplastic dysmotility with autoantibody-mediated destruction of the enteric nervous system (the interstitial cells of Cajal, also called the intrinsic pacemaker of the gastrointestinal tract, or the myenteric plexus).

Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has the potential to minimize the toxicity. Between 2000 and 2005, 21 patients underwent IMRT for unknown primary head and neck cancer at our center. Of the 21 patients, 5 received IMRT with definitive intent and 16 as postoperative therapy; 14 received concurrent chemotherapy and 7 IMRT alone. The target volumes included the bilateral neck and mucosal surface. The median dose was 66 Gy. Acute and chronic toxicities, esophageal strictures, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube dependence were evaluated. Progression-free survival, regional progression-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, and overall survival were estimated with Kaplan-Meier curves. With a median follow-up of 24 months, the 2-year regional progression-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, and overall survival rate was 90%, 90%, and 85%, respectively. Acute grade 1 and 2 xerostomia was seen in 57% and 43% of patients, respectively. Salivary function improved with time. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement was required in 72% with combined modality treatment and 43% with IMRT alone. Only 1 patient required percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy support at the last follow-up visit. Two patients treated with combined modality and one treated with IMRT alone developed esophageal strictures, but all had improvement or resolution with dilation. The preliminary analysis of IMRT for unknown primary head and neck cancer has shown acceptable toxicity and encouraging efficacy.

Surg. Pathol.,2007-11-01,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common nonepithelial neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract and show a predilection for the stomach. Most are detected because of symptoms, but some are incidental findings at autopsy or surgery for other reasons. Incidental GISTs tend to be smaller at diagnosis, but even small (<1 cm) GISTs have been shown to harbor activating KIT mutations at rates similar to advanced GISTs. However, the prevalence and characteristics of small GISTs in surgical resections of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) remains unclear. We studied 150 esophagogastric resections for esophageal or EGJ carcinomas (100 with preoperative chemoradiation and 50 untreated cases) that had been extensively embedded for histologic examination (mean 30 sections/case). Number, size, morphology, and location of all GISTs and leiomyomas were recorded. All potential GISTs were evaluated with CD117 and CD34 immunohistochemistry, and a subset (35) leiomyomas with smooth muscle actin, desmin, and CD117. We found 18 incidental GISTs in 15 of 150 (10%) patients; 3 patients harbored 2 separate lesions. Prevalence of GIST was identical in treated (10 of 100) and untreated (5 of 50) cases. All (100%) showed positivity for both CD117 and CD34 and all were of spindle cell morphology. Lesions ranged from 0.2 to 3.0 mm in size (mean 1.3 mm). Eight (44%) were based in the outer muscularis propria, 7 (39%) in inner muscularis, and 3 (17%) between the muscle layers. The lesions tended to cluster near the EGJ, with 8 (44%) on the gastric side, 9 (50%) on the esophageal side, and 1 (6%) undetermined owing to overlying ulceration. Leiomyomas were even more common than GIST, occurring in 47% of patients (44% of treated and 52% of untreated, P=0.39), with a mean of 3 leiomyomas per patient (range 1 to 13) and mean size of 1.7 mm (range 0.2 to 12 mm). Unlike colorectal leiomyomas, most (91%) EGJ leiomyomas were located in the inner muscularis propria and only rarely (1%) in muscularis mucosa. These results suggest that GIST and leiomyoma are common incidental ""seedling"" lesions of the EGJ, found in 10% and 47% of patients undergoing surgery for esophageal carcinoma. The common occurrence of microscopic GISTs compared with the rarity of clinically manifest and malignant esophagogastric GISTs suggests that additional genetic or epigenetic alterations must happen for neoplastic progression.",Journal Article,4464.0,88.0,stromal tumors GISTs are the most common nonepithelial neoplasm of the tract and show a predilection for the Most are detected because of symptoms but some are incidental findings at autopsy or surgery for other reasons Incidental GISTs tend to be smaller at diagnosis but even small 1 cm GISTs have been shown to harbor activating KIT mutations at rates similar to advanced GISTs However the prevalence and characteristics of small GISTs in surgical resections of the esophagogastric junction EGJ remains unclear We studied 150 esophagogastric resections for or EGJ carcinomas 100 with preoperative chemoradiation and 50 untreated cases that had been extensively embedded for histologic examination mean 30 sections/case Number size morphology and location of all GISTs and leiomyomas were recorded All potential GISTs were evaluated with CD117 and CD34 immunohistochemistry and a subset 35 leiomyomas with smooth muscle actin desmin and CD117 We found 18 incidental GISTs in 15 of 150 10 patients 3 patients harbored 2 separate lesions Prevalence of GIST was identical in treated 10 of 100 and untreated 5 of 50 cases All 100 showed positivity for both CD117 and CD34 and all were of spindle cell morphology Lesions ranged from 0.2 to 3.0 mm in size mean 1.3 mm Eight 44 were based in the outer muscularis propria 7 39 in inner muscularis and 3 17 between the muscle layers The lesions tended to cluster near the EGJ with 8 44 on the side 9 50 on the side and 1 6 undetermined owing to overlying ulceration Leiomyomas were even more common than GIST occurring in 47 of patients 44 of treated and 52 of untreated P=0.39 with a mean of 3 leiomyomas per patient range 1 to 13 and mean size of 1.7 mm range 0.2 to 12 mm Unlike leiomyomas most 91 EGJ leiomyomas were located in the inner muscularis propria and only rarely 1 in muscularis mucosa These results suggest that GIST and leiomyoma are common incidental `` seedling '' lesions of the EGJ found in 10 and 47 of patients undergoing surgery for carcinoma The common occurrence of microscopic GISTs compared with the rarity of clinically manifest and malignant esophagogastric GISTs suggests that additional genetic or epigenetic alterations must happen for neoplastic progression,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[1126, 57, 2508, 32, 3, 96, 186, 16199, 2131, 1, 3, 1696, 2, 514, 8, 8904, 9, 3, 96, 32, 530, 408, 1, 507, 84, 476, 32, 4490, 272, 28, 6270, 15, 152, 9, 127, 2325, 4490, 2508, 5406, 6, 40, 2170, 28, 147, 84, 871, 302, 14, 494, 2508, 47, 85, 443, 6, 2760, 1616, 1164, 138, 28, 151, 288, 6, 131, 2508, 137, 3, 1078, 2, 374, 1, 302, 2508, 4, 221, 2185, 1, 3, 6330, 3322, 12191, 469, 1200, 21, 656, 1577, 6330, 2185, 9, 15, 12191, 826, 394, 5, 498, 975, 2, 212, 1278, 140, 17, 42, 85, 3576, 2505, 9, 884, 1385, 313, 201, 3013, 473, 207, 444, 2567, 2, 1147, 1, 62, 2508, 2, 12815, 11, 1872, 62, 174, 2508, 11, 194, 5, 6999, 2, 2215, 888, 2, 8, 697, 465, 12815, 5, 5774, 1502, 5525, 11739, 2, 6999, 21, 204, 203, 4490, 2508, 4, 167, 1, 1577, 79, 7, 27, 7, 3253, 18, 2282, 406, 1078, 1, 1394, 10, 3038, 4, 73, 79, 1, 394, 2, 1278, 33, 1, 212, 140, 62, 394, 224, 1887, 9, 110, 6999, 2, 2215, 2, 62, 11, 1, 4052, 31, 2567, 406, 1869, 29, 13, 18, 6, 27, 13, 321, 4, 444, 313, 14, 27, 321, 659, 584, 11, 90, 4, 3, 7808, 13936, 10859, 67, 587, 4, 7938, 13936, 2, 27, 269, 59, 3, 1502, 11942, 3, 406, 3886, 6, 3132, 1829, 3, 12191, 5, 66, 584, 23, 3, 1152, 83, 212, 23, 3, 1152, 2, 14, 49, 5206, 3421, 6, 21067, 5158, 12815, 11, 871, 80, 186, 76, 1394, 1821, 4, 662, 1, 7, 584, 1, 73, 2, 653, 1, 1278, 19, 13, 587, 5, 8, 313, 1, 27, 12815, 379, 69, 184, 14, 6, 233, 2, 313, 444, 1, 14, 67, 321, 184, 13, 18, 6, 133, 321, 4246, 12815, 96, 970, 12191, 12815, 11, 2308, 4, 3, 7938, 13936, 10859, 2, 158, 2416, 14, 4, 13936, 2713, 46, 99, 309, 17, 1394, 2, 12390, 32, 186, 4490, 56733, 522, 406, 1, 3, 12191, 204, 4, 79, 2, 662, 1, 7, 479, 152, 9, 134, 3, 186, 2291, 1, 2984, 2508, 72, 5, 3, 4989, 1, 505, 7633, 2, 393, 6330, 2508, 844, 17, 402, 336, 15, 1418, 593, 1642, 19834, 9, 2000, 91]",2233.0,18059218,13
Duplication of the muscularis mucosae in Barrett esophagus: an underrecognized feature and its implication for staging of adenocarcinoma.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2007-11-01,"Depth of invasion is one of the most important prognostic indicators in esophageal adenocarcinoma. Unlike other regions of the gastrointestinal tract, the esophagus in Barrett metaplasia frequently develops duplication of the muscularis mucosae (MM), but this feature is underrecognized, and its effect on appropriate staging of superficially invasive adenocarcinoma is unclear. We first randomly selected 50 esophageal resections for high-grade dysplasia or T1 adenocarcinoma in Barrett esophagus (BE) to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of MM duplication for BE and its histologic characteristics, including percentage of the Barrett segment involved by MM duplication, origin of the duplicated muscle layer, and appearance of the tissue between duplicated MM. Twenty esophageal resections for squamous cell carcinoma served as controls. Next, to study the clinical significance of MM duplication, we evaluated 30 resections for BE that had superficial adenocarcinoma confined to regions of duplicated MM. Each case was classified as: depth of invasion (inner MM, space between duplicated MM, or outer MM), angiolymphatic invasion, and rate of lymph node metastasis. We observed MM duplication in 46 of 50 (92%) BE resections, involving 5% to >90% of the Barrett segment, in contrast to none in 20 (0%) resected squamous cell carcinoma, P<0.0001. In 5 (10%) cases, the MM was focally triplicated. The outer MM was continuous with the single MM beneath squamous epithelium, suggesting that outer MM represents the ""original"" muscle layer. The space between duplicated MM predominantly consisted of loose fibrovascular tissue similar to submucosa; in 15 (30%) cases, there were also areas of fibrosis or thin muscle strands joining the 2 MM layers. Of 30 adenocarcinomas invading duplicated MM, 10 (33%) invaded only inner MM, 12 (40%) invaded the space between MM, and 8 (27%) invaded the outer MM. Angiolymphatic invasion was present in 5 (17%) cases, and nodal metastases in 3 (10%, 1 case each of invasion into inner MM, between MM, and outer MM). These data show that MM duplication is a characteristic finding in BE, but it can pose difficulty in proper staging of superficial adenocarcinomas. The 17% rate of angiolymphatic invasion and 10% rate of lymph node metastases in our patients with invasion into duplicated MM suggest that these tumors can behave aggressively despite their technically intramucosal location.",Journal Article,4464.0,67.0,Depth of invasion is one of the most important prognostic indicators in adenocarcinoma Unlike other regions of the tract the in Barrett metaplasia frequently develops duplication of the muscularis mucosae MM but this feature is underrecognized and its effect on appropriate staging of superficially invasive adenocarcinoma is unclear We first randomly selected 50 resections for high-grade dysplasia or T1 adenocarcinoma in Barrett BE to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of MM duplication for BE and its histologic characteristics including percentage of the Barrett segment involved by MM duplication origin of the duplicated muscle layer and appearance of the tissue between duplicated MM Twenty resections for squamous cell carcinoma served as controls Next to study the clinical significance of MM duplication we evaluated 30 resections for BE that had superficial adenocarcinoma confined to regions of duplicated MM Each case was classified as depth of invasion inner MM space between duplicated MM or outer MM angiolymphatic invasion and rate of lymph node metastasis We observed MM duplication in 46 of 50 92 BE resections involving 5 to 90 of the Barrett segment in contrast to none in 20 0 resected squamous cell carcinoma P 0.0001 In 5 10 cases the MM was focally triplicated The outer MM was continuous with the single MM beneath squamous epithelium suggesting that outer MM represents the `` original '' muscle layer The space between duplicated MM predominantly consisted of loose fibrovascular tissue similar to submucosa in 15 30 cases there were also areas of fibrosis or thin muscle strands joining the 2 MM layers Of 30 adenocarcinomas invading duplicated MM 10 33 invaded only inner MM 12 40 invaded the space between MM and 8 27 invaded the outer MM Angiolymphatic invasion was present in 5 17 cases and nodal metastases in 3 10 1 case each of invasion into inner MM between MM and outer MM These data show that MM duplication is a characteristic finding in BE but it can pose difficulty in proper staging of superficial adenocarcinomas The 17 rate of angiolymphatic invasion and 10 rate of lymph node metastases in our patients with invasion into duplicated MM suggest that these tumors can behave aggressively despite their technically intramucosal location,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[2436, 1, 578, 16, 104, 1, 3, 96, 305, 177, 3539, 4, 449, 4246, 127, 1374, 1, 3, 1696, 3, 4, 4366, 6054, 746, 4734, 4616, 1, 3, 13936, 15568, 321, 84, 26, 2705, 16, 16739, 2, 211, 254, 23, 870, 632, 1, 24563, 416, 449, 16, 1200, 21, 157, 1108, 715, 212, 2185, 9, 64, 88, 2253, 15, 1534, 449, 4, 4366, 40, 6, 376, 3, 485, 2, 1121, 1, 321, 4616, 9, 40, 2, 211, 884, 374, 141, 1150, 1, 3, 4366, 4610, 646, 20, 321, 4616, 1938, 1, 3, 13330, 1502, 8056, 2, 3592, 1, 3, 246, 59, 13330, 321, 737, 2185, 9, 691, 31, 134, 5275, 22, 535, 1305, 6, 45, 3, 38, 724, 1, 321, 4616, 21, 194, 201, 2185, 9, 40, 17, 42, 3562, 449, 2902, 6, 1374, 1, 13330, 321, 296, 473, 10, 1373, 22, 2436, 1, 578, 7938, 321, 3865, 59, 13330, 321, 15, 7808, 321, 13005, 578, 2, 116, 1, 263, 289, 278, 21, 164, 321, 4616, 4, 641, 1, 212, 937, 40, 2185, 1267, 33, 6, 424, 1, 3, 4366, 4610, 4, 748, 6, 1292, 4, 179, 13, 1133, 691, 31, 134, 19, 13, 488, 4, 33, 79, 140, 3, 321, 10, 9772, 56734, 3, 7808, 321, 10, 1314, 5, 3, 226, 321, 17080, 691, 2781, 802, 17, 7808, 321, 1449, 3, 2279, 522, 1502, 8056, 3, 3865, 59, 13330, 321, 2117, 1695, 1, 30598, 38607, 246, 288, 6, 13924, 4, 167, 201, 140, 125, 11, 120, 1361, 1, 3000, 15, 5648, 1502, 22228, 10690, 3, 18, 321, 11942, 1, 201, 1586, 8653, 13330, 321, 79, 466, 12274, 158, 7938, 321, 133, 327, 12274, 3, 3865, 59, 321, 2, 66, 428, 12274, 3, 7808, 321, 13005, 578, 10, 364, 4, 33, 269, 140, 2, 779, 196, 4, 27, 79, 14, 473, 296, 1, 578, 237, 7938, 321, 59, 321, 2, 7808, 321, 46, 74, 514, 17, 321, 4616, 16, 8, 2037, 1567, 4, 40, 84, 192, 122, 6015, 4035, 4, 4576, 632, 1, 3562, 1586, 3, 269, 116, 1, 13005, 578, 2, 79, 116, 1, 263, 289, 196, 4, 114, 7, 5, 578, 237, 13330, 321, 309, 17, 46, 57, 122, 10403, 8503, 550, 136, 6093, 16790, 1147]",2287.0,18059229,302
Value of endoscopic ultrasound staging in conjunction with the evaluation of lymphovascular invasion in identifying low-risk esophageal carcinoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2008-02-01,"With increasing emphasis on endoscopic therapy (ET) for T1 esophageal carcinoma, the identification of low-risk patients is critical. It was hypothesized that endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in concert with detailed histopathologic evaluation would identify low-risk cancers for an appropriate but organ-preserving strategy. All patients who had pretreatment EUS and underwent esophagectomy as primary therapy for esophageal cancer between 1999 and 2006 were analyzed retrospectively. The accuracy of EUS in predicting the correct pathologic stage was assessed along with a histopathologic reevaluation including lymphovascular invasion (LVI). Pathologic stage and various features were incorporated into a multivariate logistic regression model. A total of consecutive 87 esophageal cancer patients (81 with adenocarcinoma) were evaluable for this analysis. EUS correctly diagnosed 59 T1 cancers and 20 T2-4 cancers but understaged cancers in 2 patients and overstaged cancers in 6 patients. EUS correctly identified 8 patients with lymph node metastases but not 13 other patients. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of EUS for T1 cancers were 91%, 91%, and 91%, respectively; for T1a (intramucosal) cancers, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were: 82%, 67%, and 93%, respectively, and for lymph node involvement these same values were 81%, 38%, and 94%, respectively. LVI was found to be an independent predictor of lymph node metastases on the multivariate analysis (P = .02). Data from the current study demonstrate that EUS has excellent accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (91% each) for identifying T1 esophageal cancers and LVI is an independent predictor of lymph node metastases.

In this study, we evaluated prognostic factors among patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus who have undergone a similar treatment regimen. A retrospective review of patients with SCC of the esophagus who received CRT before esophagectomy. Data collected included demographics, CRT details, pathologic findings, and survival. Statistical methods included recursive partitioning and Kaplan-Meier analyses. From 1996 to 2006, 91 patients were appropriate for this analysis. Complete pathologic response in the primary tumor (pt-pCR) occurred in 49 patients (53.8%), including 10 of 91 (10.9%) who had a pt-pCR but residual nodal disease. Recursive partitioning analysis identified three prognostic groups: (1) group 1 (n = 52), patients with minimal residual local disease (pt-pCR and T1-N any); (2) group 2 (n = 28), patients with residual T2 disease (N0 and N1) and patients with T3-4N0 disease; and (3) group 3 (n = 11), patients with residual T3-4N1 disease. Three-year survival was 68.4% in group 1, 45.6% in group 2, and 0 % in group 3 (p < 0.001).

Is the risk of concomitant invasive esophageal cancer in high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus overestimated?,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,Clin. Gastroenterol. Hepatol.,2007-12-21,"Recent studies have claimed long neoplasia-free survival rates with endoscopic mucosal resection of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) in Barrett's esophagus (BE). However, reports have contended that approximately 40% of patients who have esophagectomy for HGD have occult invasive cancer. The aim of this study was to use explicit criteria to determine the true prevalence of invasive adenocarcinoma in reports of patients who had esophagectomy for HGD in BE. Studies reporting rates of esophageal cancer in patients who underwent esophagectomy for HGD in BE were gathered using MEDLINE and PUBMED. We defined invasive esophageal adenocarcinoma (IEAC) as tumor with submucosal invasion or beyond. Intramucosal carcinoma (IMC) was not considered IEAC. Twenty-three articles were selected for analysis. Most investigators reported rates of invasive cancer in the esophagectomy specimen, and the pooled average was 39.9% among the 441 patients who underwent an esophagectomy for HGD. Reported rates varied from 0% to 73%. A total of 267 patients had American Joint Committee on Cancer stage 0 postoperatively, 132 patients had stage I, 23 patients had stage IIa, 10 patients had stage IIb, and 9 patients had stage III. Fourteen studies provided differentiation between intramucosal and submucosal invasion. Among 213 patients, only 12.7% had IEAC, whereas 87.3% had HGD or IMC. The IEAC rate of 11% among patients with visible lesions is greater than the rate of 3% among patients with no visible lesion. By using strict pathologic definitions of invasive disease, the present study indicates the true prevalence of IEAC in BE and HGD may have been overestimated significantly.

We conducted a phase I trial to assess the maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and antitumor activity of gemcitabine and patupilone. Patients with refractory solid tumors enrolled in cohorts of three. Cohorts received fixed doses of gemcitabine (1,000 or 750 mg/m(2)) along with escalating doses of patupilone (1.5-3 mg/m(2)) on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. Twenty-seven patients received a total of 99 courses of treatment on study. Hematologic toxicity in the first cohort required a modification of the protocol to decrease the gemcitabine dose. Subsequent patients received gemcitabine 750 mg/m(2) and escalating doses of patupilone from 1.5 to 3 mg/m(2). DLTs were grade 3 asthenia and grade 3 dehydration. There was also one treatment-related death due to neutropenic infection. Other clinically significant toxicities were persistent asthenia and persistent nausea. Four patients, one each with pancreatic cancer, esophageal carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma, experienced a partial response. The dose-limiting toxicities of gemcitabine and patupilone were asthenia and dehydration. Dose reductions also occurred due to persistent fatigue that was not dose-limiting.

Ninety-nine consecutive patients with T1 adenocarcinoma were analyzed after they underwent esophagectomy/lymphadenectomy. LNM was assessed in all patients, and LVI was assessed in 89 patients. OS was correlated with pathologic cancer stage in association with LVI and LNM. The 5-year OS rate for patients with T1a tumors (88%) was superior to that for patients with T1b tumors (62%; P = .001). The 5-year OS rate for patients who had cancers without LVI (85%) was superior to the rate for patients who had cancers with LVI (36%; P = .0001). It is noteworthy that, for cancers without LVI, the 5-year OS rate for patients with T1b tumors (77%) was similar to the rate for patients with T1a tumors (90%; P = .08), but it was superior to the rate for patients with T1b tumors that had LVI (27%; P = .006). The presence of LVI and/or LNM resulted in worse 5-year OS (< or =37%) compared with the lack of LVI and/or LNM (88%; P < .001). The rate of LNM for patients who had T1b tumors without LVI still was 19%, and the relapse rate was 16%. The current results demonstrated that LVI distinguishes the biologic behavior of early esophageal cancer, and patients who have T1b cancer without LVI have a clinical biology similar to that of patients with T1a cancer. If LNM before surgery can be diagnosed with high sensitivity by better endoscopic techniques and/or molecular biomarkers, then a new therapeutic paradigm for T1b cancers could emerge.

Patients with advanced esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancer were enrolled. All gave informed consent. They were initially treated with paclitaxel 90 mg/m(2) intravenously on Day 1 and bryostatin-1 50 microg/m2 on Day 2 weekly for three consecutive weeks out of four. Because of severe myalgias, dosing was reduced to paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 with bryostatin-1 40 microg/m2 and then to paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 with bryostatin-1 25 microg/m2. Twenty-four patients were enrolled, with 22 assessable for response. The partial response rate was 27%. 10 patients treated with bryostatin-1 40-50 microg/m2 had a response rate of 40 versus 17% at bryostatin-1 25 microg/m2 (p-value = 0.3). Median time-to-progression was 3.7 months and median survival was 8.3 months. Grade 3/4 myalgias were seen in 50% of patients. Myalgias appeared to be related to bryostatin-1 dose.

Vaccine impedes the development of reflux-induced esophageal cancer in a surgical rat model: efficacy of the vaccine in a post-Barrett's esophagus setting.,Digestive diseases and sciences,Dig. Dis. Sci.,2008-03-15,"We developed and evaluated a GM-CSF whole-cell tumor vaccine for esophageal cancer. Cell lines derived from surgically induced rat reflux esophageal tumors were passaged in vitro and transfected with GM-CSF. First, the GM-CSF whole cell vaccine was evaluated against subcutaneously transplanted esophageal tumor cells. In a subsequent study, the vaccine was tested to see if it could reduce the incidence of cancer in the surgical reflux model.

F18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography screening in Li-Fraumeni syndrome.,JAMA,JAMA,2008-03-01,"Individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) have an inherited cancer predisposition to a diverse array of malignancies beginning early in life; survivors of one cancer have a markedly elevated risk of additional primary tumors. The underlying genetic defect in the majority of the families is a germline mutation in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. The diversity of tumors and rarity of families have contributed to the difficulty in devising effective screening recommendations for members of LFS kindreds. To gather preliminary data with which to evaluate F18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) imaging as a potential surveillance modality to detect early malignancies in asymptomatic members of LFS kindreds. Members of LFS families with documented germline TP53 mutations or obligate carrier status, no history of cancer within 5 years of enrollment, and no symptoms of cancer or ill-health were offered FDG-PET/CT scanning as a screening test in a comprehensive US cancer center from 2006 to 2007. Scans were initially reviewed clinically, then centrally reviewed by an expert radiologist. The primary outcome was the detection of new primary cancers using FDG-PET/CT scanning. Of 15 individuals, baseline FDG-PET/CT scan identified asymptomatic cancers in 3 (20%). Two individuals had papillary thyroid cancers (stage II and stage III) and one individual had stage II esophageal adenocarcinoma.

Is nonsmall cell type high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma of the tubular gastrointestinal tract a distinct disease entity?,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2008-05-01,"Although small cell carcinoma of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is well-recognized, nonsmall cell type high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma (HGNEC) of this site remains undefined. At the current time, neither the World Health Organization nor American Joint Committee on Cancer includes this condition in the histologic classifications, and consequently it is being diagnosed and treated inconsistently. In this study, we aimed at delineating the histologic and immunophenotypical spectrum of HGNECs of the GI tract with emphasis on histologic subtypes. Guided primarily by the World Health Organization/International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer criteria for pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors, we were able to classify 87 high-grade GI tract tumors that initially carried a diagnosis of either poorly differentiated carcinoma with or without any neuroendocrine characteristics, small cell carcinoma, or combined adenocarcinoma-neuroendocrine carcinoma into the following 4 categories. The first was small cell carcinoma (n=23), which had features typical of pulmonary small cell carcinoma, although the cells tended to have a more round nuclear contour. The second was large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (n=31), which had a morphology similar to its pulmonary counterpart and showed positive immunoreactivity for either chromogranin (71%) or synaptophysin (94%) or both. The third was mixed neuroendocrine carcinoma (n=11), which had intermediate histologic features (eg, cells with an increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio but with apparent nucleoli), and positive immunoreactivity for at least 1 neuroendocrine marker. The fourth was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (n=17). In addition, 5 of the 87 tumors showed either nonsmall cell type neuroendocrine morphology (n=3) or immunohistochemical reactivity for neuroendocrine markers (n=2), but not both. Further analysis showed that most HGNECs arising in the squamous lined parts (esophagus and anal canal) were small cell type (78%), whereas most involving the glandular mucosa were large cell (53%) or mixed (82%) type; associated adenocarcinomas were more frequent in large cell (61%) or mixed (36%) type than in small cell type (26%); and focal intracytoplasmic mucin was seen only in large cell or mixed type. As a group, the 2-year disease-specific survival for patients with HGNEC was 25.4% (median follow-up time, 11.3 mo). No significant survival difference was observed among the different histologic subtypes. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the existence of both small cell and nonsmall cell types of HGNEC in the GI tract, and provides a detailed illustration of their morphologic spectrum. There are differences in certain pathologic features between small cell and nonsmall cell types, whereas the differences between the subtypes of nonsmall cell category (large cell versus mixed) are less distinct. Given the current uncertainty as to whether large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma is as chemosensitive as small cell carcinoma even in the lung, our data provide further evidence in favor of a dichotomous classification scheme (small cell vs. nonsmall cell) for HGNEC of the GI tract. Separation of nonsmall cell type into large cell and mixed subtypes may not be necessary. These tumors are clinically aggressive.

Statins in esophageal cancer cell lines: promising lead?,The American journal of gastroenterology,Am. J. Gastroenterol.,2008-03-24,"Barrett's-associated esophageal adenocarcinoma (BEAC) is an important health concern in many western populations owing to its increasing incidence and the paucity of effective treatments. Statins have recently been suggested to induce anticancer effects against a variety of cancers in several, but not all, in vitro, in vivo, and epidemiologic studies. In the accompanying article by Ogunwobi and Beales, three statins were shown to inhibit proliferation and stimulate apoptosis in two EAC cell lines. These effects were achieved by reducing Ras, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and protein kinase B (Akt)-related cellular signaling. Although these results are promising, they are clearly preliminary, and much additional work is needed to confirm or refute the potential anticancer effects of statins in human BEAC. In addition, the work of Ogunwobi and Beales highlights the importance of developing better, more predictive in vitro and in vivo models of BEAC, and of taking promising, low-risk agents, such as statins, into early-phase therapeutic and preventive clinical trials involving cancer patients and patients with Barrett's metaplasia/dysplasia, respectively.",Comment,4320.0,6.0,Barrett's-associated adenocarcinoma BEAC is an important health concern in many western populations owing to its increasing incidence and the paucity of effective treatments Statins have recently been suggested to induce anticancer effects against a variety of cancers in several but not all in vitro in vivo and epidemiologic studies In the accompanying article by Ogunwobi and Beales three statins were shown to inhibit proliferation and stimulate apoptosis in two EAC cell lines These effects were achieved by reducing Ras extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK and protein kinase B Akt -related cellular signaling Although these results are promising they are clearly preliminary and much additional work is needed to confirm or refute the potential anticancer effects of statins in human BEAC In addition the work of Ogunwobi and Beales highlights the importance of developing better more predictive in vitro and in vivo models of BEAC and of taking promising low-risk agents such as statins into early-phase therapeutic and preventive clinical trials involving cancer patients and patients with Barrett 's metaplasia/dysplasia respectively,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[56962, 41, 449, 38677, 16, 35, 305, 341, 2893, 4, 445, 1521, 1184, 3421, 6, 211, 602, 287, 2, 3, 4832, 1, 323, 640, 5241, 47, 761, 85, 1148, 6, 1290, 1475, 176, 480, 8, 1362, 1, 163, 4, 392, 84, 44, 62, 4, 439, 4, 386, 2, 3609, 94, 4, 3, 9503, 946, 20, 45071, 2, 45072, 169, 5241, 11, 443, 6, 1433, 457, 2, 4223, 351, 4, 100, 3378, 31, 285, 46, 176, 11, 513, 20, 1818, 1102, 1976, 1235, 1065, 216, 1819, 2, 178, 216, 132, 649, 139, 763, 314, 242, 46, 99, 32, 721, 491, 32, 2536, 1676, 2, 1802, 402, 1357, 16, 575, 6, 1843, 15, 18872, 3, 174, 1475, 176, 1, 5241, 4, 171, 38677, 4, 352, 3, 1357, 1, 45071, 2, 45072, 2527, 3, 1187, 1, 931, 380, 80, 464, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 274, 1, 38677, 2, 1, 2727, 721, 154, 43, 183, 225, 22, 5241, 237, 191, 124, 189, 2, 3494, 38, 143, 1267, 12, 7, 2, 7, 5, 4366, 292, 6054, 2253, 106]",1148.0,18371147,667
Family history of cancer and associated risk of developing neuroendocrine tumors: a case-control study.,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev.,2008-04-01,"Carcinoids are rare neuroendocrine tumors (NET). Familial clusterings of NETs are rarely reported, except for a small proportion associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 1. We evaluated the effect of positive family history of NET as well as other cancers on the development of NETs arising at five different locations. We conducted a retrospective, hospital-based, case-control study involving 740 patients with histologically confirmed NETs and 924 healthy controls. Information on family history of cancer was collected, and unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to determine adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The authors observed a significant relationship between first-degree relatives with cancers and the development of NETs arising at the small intestine, stomach, lung, and pancreas; AORs (95% CI) were 1.6 (1.1-2.4), 2.5 (1.1-6.3), 2.6 (1.5-4.5), and 1.8 (1.1-3.1), respectively. A first-degree family history of esophageal cancer was significantly associated with pancreatic NETs; AOR, 5.6 (95% CI, 1.1-29.6). There was a 70% and 130% increased risk of developing small intestinal NETs among subjects with family histories of colorectal cancer and prostate cancer, respectively. Moreover, individuals with a family history of lung cancer had a 2-fold increase in risk of developing pulmonary NETs. Having a first-degree relative with any cancer in general, and NET in particular, was a risk factor for NETs.

Epigenetic inactivation of the canonical Wnt antagonist SRY-box containing gene 17 in colorectal cancer.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2008-04-01,"SRY-box containing gene 17 (Sox17) is a member of the high mobility group (HMG) transcription factor superfamily, which plays critical roles in the regulation of development and stem/precursor cell function, at least partly through repression of Wnt pathway activity. Modulators controlling aberrant Wnt signaling activation are frequently disrupted in human cancers through complementary effects of epigenetic and genetic changes. Our recent global analysis of CpG island hypermethylation and gene expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines revealed that SOX17 gene silencing is associated with DNA hypermethylation of a CpG island in the promoter region. Here, we report that CpG island methylation-dependent silencing of SOX17 occurs in 100% of CRC cell lines, 86% of colorectal adenomas, 100% of stage I and II CRC, 89% of stage III CRC, 89% of primary esophageal cancer, and 50% of non-small cell lung cancer. Overexpression of SOX17 in HCT116 CRC cells inhibits colony growth and beta-catenin/T-cell factor-dependent transcription. Structure-based deletion analysis further shows the presence of a Wnt signaling repression domain in the SOX17 HMG box. Together, our studies suggest that SOX17 is a negative modulator of canonical Wnt signaling, and that SOX17 silencing due to promoter hypermethylation is an early event during tumorigenesis and may contribute to aberrant activation of Wnt signaling in CRC.",Journal Article,4312.0,135.0,SRY-box containing gene 17 Sox17 is a member of the high mobility group HMG transcription factor superfamily which plays critical roles in the regulation of development and stem/precursor cell function at least partly through repression of Wnt pathway activity Modulators controlling aberrant Wnt signaling activation are frequently disrupted in human cancers through complementary effects of epigenetic and genetic changes Our recent global analysis of CpG island hypermethylation and gene expression in cancer CRC cell lines revealed that SOX17 gene silencing is associated with DNA hypermethylation of a CpG island in the promoter region Here we report that CpG island methylation-dependent silencing of SOX17 occurs in 100 of CRC cell lines 86 of adenomas 100 of stage I and II CRC 89 of stage III CRC 89 of primary cancer and 50 of cell cancer Overexpression of SOX17 in HCT116 CRC cells inhibits colony growth and beta-catenin/T-cell factor-dependent transcription Structure-based deletion analysis further shows the presence of a Wnt signaling repression domain in the SOX17 HMG box Together our studies suggest that SOX17 is a negative modulator of canonical Wnt signaling and that SOX17 silencing due to promoter hypermethylation is an early event during tumorigenesis and may contribute to aberrant activation of Wnt signaling in CRC,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[31266, 4971, 1101, 145, 269, 22473, 16, 8, 2693, 1, 3, 64, 5717, 87, 13559, 866, 161, 8845, 92, 1698, 740, 1790, 4, 3, 863, 1, 193, 2, 452, 2765, 31, 343, 28, 506, 5180, 298, 5255, 1, 2112, 308, 128, 5014, 1893, 1898, 2112, 314, 363, 32, 746, 5576, 4, 171, 163, 298, 3380, 176, 1, 1418, 2, 336, 400, 114, 435, 1648, 65, 1, 2075, 3454, 2575, 2, 145, 55, 4, 12, 590, 31, 285, 553, 17, 22473, 145, 2077, 16, 41, 5, 261, 2575, 1, 8, 2075, 3454, 4, 3, 973, 1053, 467, 21, 414, 17, 2075, 3454, 569, 470, 2077, 1, 22473, 1780, 4, 394, 1, 590, 31, 285, 868, 1, 2751, 394, 1, 82, 70, 2, 215, 590, 887, 1, 82, 316, 590, 887, 1, 86, 12, 2, 212, 1, 31, 12, 851, 1, 22473, 4, 4522, 590, 37, 1576, 1975, 129, 2, 1090, 1778, 102, 31, 161, 470, 866, 2772, 90, 1528, 65, 195, 1949, 3, 463, 1, 8, 2112, 314, 5255, 1398, 4, 3, 22473, 13559, 4971, 1162, 114, 94, 309, 17, 22473, 16, 8, 199, 6318, 1, 4471, 2112, 314, 2, 17, 22473, 2077, 520, 6, 973, 2575, 16, 35, 191, 774, 190, 1565, 2, 68, 1248, 6, 1898, 363, 1, 2112, 314, 4, 590]",1343.0,18413743,645

"Treatment of radioresistant stem-like esophageal cancer cells by an apoptotic gene-armed, telomerase-specific oncolytic adenovirus.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2008-05-01,"Radioresistance may be caused by cancer stem cells (CSC). Because CSCs require telomerase to proliferate, a telomerase-specific oncolytic adenoviral vector carrying apoptotic tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and E1A gene (Ad/TRAIL-E1) may preferentially target CSCs. We established two pairs of parental and radioresistant (R) esophageal carcinoma cell lines (Seg-1, Seg-1R and TE-2, TE-2R) by fractionated irradiation. Stem cell markers were measured by Western blotting and flow cytometry. Serial sorting was used to enrich stem-like side population cells. Telomerase activity, transgene expression, antitumor activity, apoptosis induction, and viral replication were determined in vitro and/or in vivo. Expression of the stem cell markers beta-catenin, Oct3/4, and beta(1) integrin in Seg-1R cells was 29.4%, 27.5%, and 97.3%, respectively, compared with 4.8%, 14.9%, and 45.3% in Seg-1 cells (P < 0.05). SP levels in Seg-1R and TE-2R cells were 14.6% and 2.7%, respectively, compared with 3.4% and 0.3% in Seg-1 and TE-2 cells. Serial sorting of Seg-1R SP cells showed enrichment of the SP cells. Telomerase activities in Seg-1R, Seg-1R SP, and TE-2R cells were significantly higher than in Seg-1, Seg-1R non-SP, and TE-2 cells, respectively (P < 0.05). Seg-1R and TE-2R cells were more sensitive to Ad/TRAIL-E1 than parental cells. Increased Coxsackie-adenovirus receptor and elevated transgene expressions were found in the radioresistant cells.

Dose to larynx predicts for swallowing complications after intensity-modulated radiotherapy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2008-05-28,"To evaluate early swallowing after intensity-modulated radiotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and determine factors correlating with aspiration and/or stricture. Consecutive patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy between September 2004 and August 2006 at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute/Brigham and Women's Hospital were evaluated with institutional review board approval. Patients underwent swallowing evaluation after completion of therapy; including video swallow studies. The clinical- and treatment-related variables were examined for correlation with aspiration or strictures, as well as doses to the larynx, pharyngeal constrictor muscles, and cervical esophagus. The correlation was assessed with logistic regression analysis. A total of 96 patients were evaluated. Their median age was 55 years, and 79 (82%) were men. The primary site of cancer was the oropharynx in 43, hypopharynx/larynx in 17, oral cavity in 13, nasopharynx in 11, maxillary sinus in 2, and unknown primary in 10. Of the 96 patients, 85% underwent definitive RT and 15% postoperative RT. Also, 28 patients underwent induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy, 59 received concurrent chemotherapy, and 9 patients underwent RT alone. The median follow-up was 10 months. Of the 96 patients, 31 (32%) had clinically significant aspiration and 36 (37%) developed a stricture. The radiation dose-volume metrics, including the volume of the larynx receiving >or=50 Gy (p = 0.04 and p = 0.03, respectively) and volume of the inferior constrictor receiving >or=50 Gy (p = 0.05 and p = 0.02, respectively) were significantly associated with both aspiration and stricture.

Cancer Res.,2008-05-01,"The epidermal growth factor (EGF) pathway is important in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) tumorigenesis. We hypothesized that the EGF A61G homozygous variant genotype (GG) is (a) both a risk and poor prognostic factor for EAC and (b) associated with higher EGF serum levels in individuals with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Using unconditional logistic regression, we compared EGF A61G in 312 EAC cases and 447 GERD-free controls, adjusting for age, gender, smoking history, and healthy adult body mass index. Using the method of Kaplan and Meier, log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazard models, we correlated EGF A61G with overall and failure-free survival in the EAC cases. Serum EGF levels and EGF genotype (G/G versus others) were correlated in 144 GERD patients using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. The EGF A61G G/G genotype conferred increased EAC risk, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.81 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.7), and was even higher in the subgroup of EAC patients with concurrent Barrett's esophagus (adjusted odds ratio, 2.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-3.7). However, EGF A61G was not associated with a more aggressive phenotype or prognosis in EAC patients. Higher serum EGF levels were found in GERD patients carrying G/G compared with A/A or A/G (P = 0.03, Wilcoxon rank sum test). The EGF A61G G/G genotype is associated with a near 2-fold greater risk of EAC. The G/G allele was also associated with higher EGF levels in tumor-free patients with GERD.

Preoperative therapy in esophageal cancer.,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,2008-05-01,"Progress has been made in the treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer. Preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy also appears to improve survival in gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma compared to surgery alone. Adding radiotherapy to preoperative chemotherapy enhances rates of curative resection, achieves measurable rates of pathologic complete response, and recent trials indicate a survival benefit for preoperative chemoradiotherapy compared to surgery alone in esophageal cancer. Given the achievement of pathologic complete responses with combined chemoradiotherapy in esophageal cancer, recent trials have evaluated the contribution of surgery after chemoradiotherapy. With currently available systemic therapy for squamous cancers of the esophagus that respond to combined chemoradiotherapy, there is no clear survival benefit for the addition of surgery after chemoradiotherapy despite improvements in local tumor control with the addition of surgery. Surgery may salvage nonresponding patients with biopsy-positive residual disease. For adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, a histology with consistently lower rates of pathologic complete response than squamous cell cancer, surgery appears to play a greater role.

The harmonic scalpel technique without supplementary ligation in total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection: a prospective randomized study.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2008-06-01,"To investigate the safety and efficacy of the no-tie (NT) technique using the harmonic scalpel (HS) in terms of the operating time and complications in total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection (CND). Recently, the HS has been used as an alternative to conventional hand-tied ligation for hemostasis in thyroid surgery, which is a time-consuming procedure. Limited data have been published on the evidence of its safety in total thyroidectomy accompanied by CND without supplementary hand-tied ligation. Sixty-five consecutive thyroidectomized patients were enrolled in this study. The final pathology in all the patients was thyroid papillary carcinoma. All patients underwent total thyroidectomy with CND. The NT technique using HS group consisted of 31 patients. The conventional hand-tied ligation technique group comprised 34 patients. The following variables were examined: operating time, intraoperative bleeding, incidence of perioperative complications (hemorrhage, hematoma, seroma, recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, hypoparathyroidism, and injury to the adjacent structures including the trachea and esophagus), the number of pathologically proven lymph nodes, total amount of drainage, duration of drain placement, and time of hospital discharge. The use of the HS reduced the operating time of total thyroidectomy with CND by an average of 43.12 minutes (P < 0.001). The number of pathologically proven lymph nodes was 7.32 +/- 1.66 in the NT group and 6.85 +/- 1.76 in the CT group (P = 0.274). No significant difference was observed in the overall perioperative complications, such as postoperative bleeding, temporary recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, and temporary hypoparathyroidism, between the 2 groups.

Quantitative endoscopy in the chemoprevention of Barrett's Esophagus Trial.,Diseases of the esophagus : official journal of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus,Dis. Esophagus,2008-06-02,"The Chemoprevention for Barrett's Esophagus Trial (CBET) was a phase IIb, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of celecoxib in patients with Barrett's esophagus. The overall outcome of the study was that there were no significant differences in primary, secondary, or tertiary outcomes. The purpose of the current study is to focus on results related to the method of measuring lesion size called quantitative endoscopy (QE). The design includes a review of a total number of studies and then restricts analyses to the four clinics that enrolled more than four patients each for whom a baseline and 1-year QE study was performed, comparing intra- and inter-patient and clinic differences in Barrett's esophagus. Measurements include the number of total QEs and adverse events, changes in areas from baseline to 1 year and other intervals, classification of Barrett's lesion type with respect to patients, clinics, and treatment. A total of 309 QE studies were completed with no adverse events. Differences in surface area measurements over time for a particular patient are smaller than the differences for randomly selected patients. The complexity mix (as defined by the mix of circumferential, tongues, and islands) of the Barrett's lesions varied with different clinics. In conclusion, QE is an efficient, safe, and accurate way to measure the area of Barrett's lesions variation between different clinical sites may be attributable to a subtle type of selection bias at the individual clinics rather than to regional differences.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",4250.0,3.0,The Chemoprevention for Barrett 's Trial CBET was a phase IIb multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial of celecoxib in patients with Barrett 's The overall outcome of the study was that there were no significant differences in primary secondary or tertiary outcomes The purpose of the current study is to focus on results related to the method of measuring lesion size called quantitative endoscopy QE The design includes a review of a total number of studies and then restricts analyses to the four clinics that enrolled more than four patients each for whom a baseline and 1-year QE study was performed comparing intra- and inter-patient and clinic differences in Barrett 's Measurements include the number of total QEs and adverse events changes in areas from baseline to 1 year and other intervals classification of Barrett 's lesion type with respect to patients clinics and treatment A total of 309 QE studies were completed with no adverse events Differences in surface area measurements over time for a particular patient are smaller than the differences for randomly selected patients The complexity mix as defined by the mix of circumferential tongues and islands of the Barrett 's lesions varied with different clinics In conclusion QE is an efficient safe and accurate way to measure the area of Barrett 's lesions variation between different clinical sites may be attributable to a subtle type of selection bias at the individual clinics rather than to regional differences,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[3, 2886, 9, 4366, 292, 160, 31080, 10, 8, 124, 3884, 1570, 384, 619, 1149, 160, 1, 2673, 4, 7, 5, 4366, 292, 3, 63, 228, 1, 3, 45, 10, 17, 125, 11, 77, 93, 362, 4, 86, 568, 15, 2557, 123, 3, 743, 1, 3, 291, 45, 16, 6, 1222, 23, 99, 139, 6, 3, 596, 1, 2978, 1180, 444, 3472, 1156, 4199, 26710, 3, 771, 1920, 8, 206, 1, 8, 181, 207, 1, 94, 2, 818, 20614, 318, 6, 3, 294, 4736, 17, 346, 80, 76, 294, 7, 296, 9, 953, 8, 330, 2, 14, 111, 26710, 45, 10, 173, 1430, 2392, 2, 3606, 69, 2, 1188, 362, 4, 4366, 292, 1685, 643, 3, 207, 1, 181, 57122, 2, 290, 281, 400, 4, 1361, 29, 330, 6, 14, 111, 2, 127, 1582, 947, 1, 4366, 292, 1180, 267, 5, 2184, 6, 7, 4736, 2, 24, 8, 181, 1, 9440, 26710, 94, 11, 781, 5, 77, 290, 281, 362, 4, 1255, 965, 1685, 252, 98, 9, 8, 1454, 69, 32, 2170, 76, 3, 362, 9, 1108, 715, 7, 3, 3082, 8842, 22, 395, 20, 3, 8842, 1, 7937, 23074, 2, 6046, 1, 3, 4366, 292, 406, 2051, 5, 338, 4736, 4, 1221, 26710, 16, 35, 2547, 1165, 2, 1481, 2255, 6, 1463, 3, 965, 1, 4366, 292, 406, 1380, 59, 338, 38, 633, 68, 40, 2971, 6, 8, 7543, 267, 1, 881, 2947, 28, 3, 797, 4736, 1832, 76, 6, 951, 362]",1493.0,18522640,589

Despite this progress, these new therapies have provided minimal benefit in the treatment of upper gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies. Hence, the overall survival of patients with upper GI tumors remains dismal. These disappointing results are largely due to the lack of early detection strategies, inadequate medical treatments and the poor understanding of upper GI tumor biology. Clinically, the treatment paradigm has been evolving for these malignancies. Esophageal cancer is now commonly treated with preoperative chemoradiation in the USA, in both academic and community cancer centers, due to its theoretical advantages. Adjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiation are also frequently used in patients with pancreatic cancer. Exciting prospects remain in the medical and surgical treatment of these malignancies with the inclusion of biologic agents in many protocols, newer chemotherapeutic agents (such as S-1 in the treatment of gastric cancer), and the use of minimally invasive procedures for the treatment of premalignant and, possibly, early malignant lesions of the esophagus and stomach.

Utility of biomarkers in prediction of response to ablative therapy in Barrett's esophagus.,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,2008-05-07,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of high-grade dysplasia (HGD)/mucosal carcinoma in Barrett's esophagus (BE). Substantial proportions of patients do not respond to PDT or progress to carcinoma despite PDT. The role of biomarkers in predicting response to PDT is unknown. We aimed to determine if biomarkers known to be associated with neoplasia in BE can predict loss of dysplasia in patients treated with ablative therapy for HGD/intramucosal cancer. Patients with BE and HGD/intramucosal cancer were studied prospectively from 2002 to 2006. Biomarkers were assessed using fluorescence in situ hybridization performed on cytology specimens, for region-specific and centromeric probes. Patients were treated with PDT using cylindric diffusing fibers (wavelength, 630 nm; energy, 200 J/cm fiber). Univariate and multiple variable logistic regression was performed to determine predictors of response to PDT. A total of 126 consecutive patients (71 who underwent PDT and 55 patients who did not undergo PDT and were under surveillance, to adjust for the natural history of HGD), were included in this study. Fifty (40%) patients were responders (no dysplasia or carcinoma) at 3 months after PDT. On multiple variable analysis, P16 allelic loss (odds ratio [OR], 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.10-0.96) predicted decreased response to PDT. BE segment length (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.59-0.85), and performance of PDT (OR, 7.17; 95% CI, 2.50-20.53) were other independent predictors of loss of dysplasia. p16 loss detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization can help predict loss of dysplasia in patients with BE and HGD/mucosal cancer.

The overall survival (OS) and cause-specific survival for patients with Stage T2-T4, any N, M0 (cT2-T4M0) esophageal cancer who had undergone definitive surgery between 1998 and 2004 were analyzed by querying the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results database. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated and univariate comparisons were made using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards survival regression multivariate analysis was performed with NeoRT, T stage (T2 vs. T3-T4), pathologic nodal status (pN0 vs. pN1), number of nodes dissected (>10 vs. </=10), histologic type (adenocarcinoma vs. squamous cell carcinoma), age (<65 vs. >/=65 years), and gender as covariates. A total of 1,033 patients were identified. Of these, 441 patients received NeoRT and 592 underwent esophagectomy alone; 77% were men, 67% had adenocarcinoma, and 72% had Stage T3-T4 disease. The median OS and cause-specific survival were both significantly greater for patients who received NeoRT compared with esophagectomy alone (27 vs. 18 months and 35 vs. 21 months, respectively, p <0.0001).

Effects of axial resolution improvement on optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of gastrointestinal tissues.,Optics express,Opt Express,2008-02-01,"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an emerging medical imaging technology which generates high resolution, cross-sectional images in situ, without the need for excisional biopsy. Previous clinical studies using endoscopic OCT with standard 10-15 microm axial resolution have demonstrated its capability in diagnosing Barrett's esophagus (BE) and high-grade dysplasia (HGD). Quantitative OCT image analysis has shown promise for detecting HGD in Barrett's esophagus patients. We recently developed an endoscopic OCT system with an improved axial resolution of approximately 5 microm. The goal in this manuscript is to compare standard resolution OCT and ultrahigh resolution OCT (UHR-OCT) for image quality and computer-aided detection using normal and Barrett's esophagus. OCT images of gastrointestinal (GI) tissues were obtained using UHR-OCT (5.5 microm) and standard resolution OCT (13 microm). Image quality including the speckle size and sharpness was compared. Texture features of endoscopic OCT images from normal and Barrett's esophagus were extracted using quantitative metrics including spatial frequency analysis and statistical texture analysis. These features were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the vector dimension and increase the discriminative power, followed by linear discrimination analysis (LDA). UHR-OCT images of GI tissues improved visualization of fine architectural features compared to standard resolution OCT. In addition, the quantitative image feature analysis showed enhanced discrimination of normal and Barrett's esophagus with UHR-OCT. The ability of UHR-OCT to resolve tissue morphology at improved resolution enables visualization of subtle features in OCT images, which may be useful in disease diagnosis.

PET/CT fusion scan enhances CT staging in patients with pancreatic neoplasms.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2008-06-13,"The role of fusion positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans (PET/CT) in staging of patients with pancreatic neoplasms (PN) is poorly defined. PET/CT may serve as an adjunct to standard imaging by increasing occult metastases detection. The purpose of this study was to assess the additional value, in relation to computed tomography (CT), of PET/CT imaging for patients with PN. Eighty-two patients with potentially resectable PN underwent staging with PET/CT and CT of the chest and abdomen. Sensitivity of diagnosing pancreatic cancer by PET/CT avidity was evaluated. The sensitivity of detecting metastases was compared between PET/CT, standard CT, and the combination of PET/CT and CT. The impact of PET/CT on patient management was estimated by calculating the percentage of patients whose treatment plan was altered due to PET/CT. The sensitivity and specificity of PET/CT in diagnosing pancreatic cancer were 89% and 88%, respectively. Sensitivity of detecting metastatic disease for PET/CT alone, standard CT alone, and the combination of PET/CT and CT were 61%, 57%, and 87%, respectively. Findings on PET/CT influenced the clinical management in seven patients (11%), two with a supraclavicular lymph node (LN), two occult liver lesions, two peritoneal implants, and one peri-esophageal LN.

Correlation of histology with biomarker status after photodynamic therapy in Barrett esophagus.,Cancer,Cancer,2008-08-01,"Currently, histology is used as the endpoint to define success with photodynamic therapy (PDT) in patients with high-grade dysplasia (HGD). Recurrences despite 'successful' ablation are common. The role of biomarkers in assessing response to PDT remains undefined. The objectives of the current study were 1) to assess biomarkers in a prospective cohort of patients with HGD/mucosal cancer before and after PDT and 2) to correlate biomarker status after PDT with histology. Patients who underwent PDT for HGD/mucosal cancer were studied prospectively. All patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, 4-quadrant biopsies every centimeter, endoscopic mucosal resection of visible nodules, and endoscopic ultrasound. Cytology samples were obtained by using standard cytology brushes. Biomarkers were assessed by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The biomarkers that were assessed included loss of 9p21 (site of the p16 gene) and 17p13.1 (site of the p53 gene) loci; gains of the 8q24(c-myc), 17q (HER2-neu), and 20q13 loci; and multiple gains. Patients received PDT 48 hours after the administration of sodium porfimer. Demographic and clinical variables were collected prospectively. Patients were followed with endoscopy and repeat cytology for biomarkers. The McNemar test was used to compare biomarker proportions before and after PDT. Thirty-one patients were studied. The median patient age was 66 years (interquartile range [IQR], 56-73 years), and 28 patients (88%) were men. The mean Barrett segment length was 5 cm (standard error of the mean, 0.5 cm). Post-PDT biomarkers were obtained after a median duration of 9 months (IQR, 3-12 months). There was a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of several biomarkers assessed after PDT. Six patients without HGD after PDT still had positive FISH results for 1 or more biomarkers: of these, 2 patients (33%) developed recurrent HGD. In this initial study, histologic downgrading of dysplasia after PDT was associated with the loss of biomarkers that have been associated with progression of neoplasia in Barrett esophagus. Patients with persistently positive biomarkers appeared to be at a higher risk of recurrent HGD. These findings should be confirmed in a larger study.",Clinical Trial,4190.0,27.0,Currently histology is used as the endpoint to define success with photodynamic therapy PDT in patients with high-grade dysplasia HGD Recurrences despite 'successful ablation are common The role of biomarkers in assessing response to PDT remains undefined The objectives of the current study were 1 to assess biomarkers in a prospective cohort of patients with HGD/mucosal cancer before and after PDT and 2 to correlate biomarker status after PDT with histology Patients who underwent PDT for HGD/mucosal cancer were studied prospectively All patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy 4-quadrant biopsies every centimeter endoscopic mucosal resection of visible nodules and endoscopic ultrasound Cytology samples were obtained by using standard cytology brushes Biomarkers were assessed by using fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH The biomarkers that were assessed included loss of 9p21 site of the p16 gene and 17p13.1 site of the p53 gene loci gains of the 8q24 c-myc 17q HER2-neu and 20q13 loci and multiple gains Patients received PDT 48 hours after the administration of sodium porfimer Demographic and clinical variables were collected prospectively Patients were followed with endoscopy and repeat cytology for biomarkers The McNemar test was used to compare biomarker proportions before and after PDT Thirty-one patients were studied The median patient age was 66 years interquartile range IQR 56-73 years and 28 patients 88 were men The mean Barrett segment length was 5 cm standard error of the mean 0.5 cm Post-PDT biomarkers were obtained after a median duration of 9 months IQR 3-12 months There was a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of several biomarkers assessed after PDT Six patients without HGD after PDT still had positive FISH results for 1 or more biomarkers of these 2 patients 33 developed recurrent HGD In this initial study histologic downgrading of dysplasia after PDT was associated with the loss of biomarkers that have been associated with progression of neoplasia in Barrett Patients with persistently positive biomarkers appeared to be at a higher risk of recurrent HGD These findings should be confirmed in a larger study,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[694, 784, 16, 95, 22, 3, 1138, 6, 1107, 1825, 5, 6910, 36, 3442, 4, 7, 5, 64, 88, 2253, 6623, 1593, 550, 57154, 1650, 32, 186, 3, 200, 1, 582, 4, 1977, 51, 6, 3442, 469, 5425, 3, 2409, 1, 3, 291, 45, 11, 14, 6, 423, 582, 4, 8, 482, 180, 1, 7, 5, 6623, 3068, 12, 348, 2, 50, 3442, 2, 18, 6, 1513, 901, 156, 50, 3442, 5, 784, 7, 54, 208, 3442, 9, 6623, 3068, 12, 11, 656, 1143, 62, 7, 208, 28456, 39, 8832, 1154, 454, 24731, 2056, 3068, 170, 1, 4822, 2597, 2, 2056, 1945, 2045, 347, 11, 683, 20, 75, 260, 2045, 31307, 582, 11, 275, 20, 75, 1591, 4, 957, 1554, 1277, 3, 582, 17, 11, 275, 159, 407, 1, 9016, 606, 1, 3, 1932, 145, 2, 7526, 14, 606, 1, 3, 624, 145, 2012, 3849, 1, 3, 6069, 256, 1371, 10529, 354, 1637, 2, 15174, 2012, 2, 232, 3849, 7, 103, 3442, 576, 1459, 50, 3, 634, 1, 4682, 26298, 1540, 2, 38, 682, 11, 786, 1143, 7, 11, 370, 5, 4199, 2, 2334, 2045, 9, 582, 3, 10665, 412, 10, 95, 6, 932, 901, 4117, 348, 2, 50, 3442, 977, 104, 7, 11, 656, 3, 52, 69, 89, 10, 700, 60, 2899, 184, 2245, 664, 803, 60, 2, 339, 7, 889, 11, 325, 3, 313, 4366, 4610, 1318, 10, 33, 494, 260, 3444, 1, 3, 313, 13, 33, 494, 539, 3442, 582, 11, 683, 50, 8, 52, 654, 1, 83, 53, 2245, 27, 133, 53, 125, 10, 8, 712, 93, 775, 4, 3, 920, 1, 392, 582, 275, 50, 3442, 437, 7, 187, 6623, 50, 3442, 1234, 42, 109, 1277, 99, 9, 14, 15, 80, 582, 1, 46, 18, 7, 466, 276, 387, 6623, 4, 26, 388, 45, 884, 18473, 1, 2253, 50, 3442, 10, 41, 5, 3, 407, 1, 582, 17, 47, 85, 41, 5, 91, 1, 2298, 4, 4366, 7, 5, 8684, 109, 582, 2121, 6, 40, 28, 8, 142, 43, 1, 387, 6623, 46, 272, 257, 40, 557, 4, 8, 1077, 45]",2183.0,18553366,49
Dose escalation of gemcitabine is possible with concurrent chest three-dimensional rather than two-dimensional radiotherapy: a phase I trial in patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2008-06-14,"To determine in a Phase I study the maximum tolerated dose of weekly gemcitabine concurrent with radiotherapy in locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as the relationship between the volume of the esophagus irradiated and severe esophagitis. Twenty-one patients with Stage III NSCLC received gemcitabine initially at 150 mg/m(2)/wk over 7 weeks concurrently with chest radiotherapy to 63 Gy in 34 fractions. The first 9 patients underwent treatment with two-dimensional (2D) radiotherapy; the remaining 12 patients, with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and target volume reduced to clinically apparent disease. Consolidation was 4 cycles of gemcitabine at 1000 mg/m(2)/wk and cisplatin 60 mg/m(2). In the 2D group, the dose-limiting toxicity, Grade 3 esophagitis, occurred in 3 of 6 patients in the 150-mg/m(2)/wk cohort and 2 of 3 patients in the 125-mg/m(2)/wk cohort. No cases of Grade 3 esophagitis occurred at these doses in the 3D group. At gemcitabine 190 mg/m(2)/wk, 2 of 6 patients in the 3D cohort had Grade 3 esophagitis. The mean percentages of esophagus irradiated to 60 Gy were 68% in the 2D cohort and 18% in the 3D cohort. We could not escalate the dose of gemcitabine with concurrent radiotherapy when using 2D planning because of severe acute esophagitis. However, we could escalate the dose of gemcitabine to 190 mg/m(2)/wk when using 3D planning. The Phase II dose is 150 mg/m(2)/wk.

Free-flap reconstruction in the doubly irradiated patient population.,Plastic and reconstructive surgery,Plast. Reconstr. Surg.,2008-07-01,"The standard of care for previously irradiated, unresectable, recurrent head and neck cancer has been chemotherapy alone. High-dose reirradiation with concomitant chemotherapy represents a more aggressive approach to these tumors and has afforded encouraging results with an increased fraction of long-term survivors. After reirradiation, these patients commonly present with extensive tissue loss, nonhealing wounds, contractures, and fistulas, and free-flap reconstruction is often necessary to correct the perils of oncologic treatment. A 9-year retrospective review of 35 patients who required surgical intervention following a second round of chemoradiation was performed. Thirty-three free flaps were performed on 24 patients, and total radiation given before free tissue transfer ranged from 100 to 200 Gy. Indications for free-flap reconstruction included soft-tissue necrosis (15 of 33), tumor ablation (seven of 33), osteoradionecrosis (six of 33), oral incompetence (three of 33), tracheal perforation (one of 33), and esophageal stricture (one of 33). Free tissue transfer was successful in 94 percent (31 of 33) of flaps, with an overall major complication rate of 66 percent (23 of 35). Wound dehiscence (15 percent), infection (15 percent), hematoma (12 percent), fistula formation (12 percent), partial flap necrosis (9 percent), and total flap necrosis (6 percent) were the most commonly seen complications. Although complications are common, free tissue transfer offers the difficult reirradiated patient a successful means of wound rehabilitation.

In her second decade, a hamartomatous soft tissue extremity mass and diffuse gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyposis with pathologic features suggestive of either juvenile, Peutz-Jeghers, or Cowden polyps were identified, along with diffuse esophageal glycogenic acanthosis and skin manifestations. During regular thyroid cancer surveillance under the provisional diagnosis of Cowden syndrome, papillary thyroid carcinoma and benign follicular nodules were diagnosed at age 23. PTEN mutational analysis revealed a novel germline nonsense point mutation of Q219X. Loss of PTEN heterozygosity was also present in the ovarian dysgerminoma. Parental mutation testing and phenotype screening were negative. The correct classification of Cowden syndrome is difficult because of its protean manifestations and overlapping phenotypes with other genetic and noninherited pathologies, particularly regarding various gastrointestinal polyposis syndromes. Despite the challenges, correct classification is critical to patient care because of the associated cancer predispositions and necessary surveillance programs.

Influence of induction chemotherapy and class of cytotoxics on pathologic response and survival after preoperative chemoradiation in patients with carcinoma of the esophagus.,Cancer,Cancer,2008-09-01,"Patients with localized esophageal cancer (LEC) have diverse outcomes (post-therapy pathologic response, disease-free survival [DFS], and overall survival [OS]) after preoperative chemoradiation (P-CTRT), dictated also by inherent molecular heterogeneity. Whether the type of therapy influences the outcomes remains largely unanswered. It is hypothesized that induction chemotherapy (IC) or the type of cytotoxics used would not influence patient outcomes. In this retrospective analysis, consecutive patients with LEC who had P-CTRT were analyzed. Data were collected regarding age, sex, baseline clinical stage, location, type of cytotoxics, post-therapy pathology, DFS, and OS. IC and the type of cytotoxics used were found to be correlated with DFS, OS, and post-therapy pathologic response. A total of 180 patients with LEC (119 had IC before P-CTRT, all had received 5-fluorouracil, 87 had received a taxane, and 57 had received a platinol) were analyzed. The median survival (MS) of all patients was 57.7 months and the 3-year and 5-year OS rates were 65.4% and 46.5%, respectively. The type of therapy appeared to have no influence on the outcome: IC versus no IC (P = .58) or platinol versus taxane versus platinol plus taxane (P = .63).

Knowledge of indications and utilization of EUS: a survey of oncologists in the United States.,Journal of clinical gastroenterology,J. Clin. Gastroenterol.,2008-09-01,"Since its advent, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has emerged as an invaluable tool in the diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal and adjacent cancers. Yet, it remains unclear how non-gastroenterologists who manage these malignancies use EUS in their practices. A link to a self-administered questionnaire, hosted on our university website, was emailed to 650 practicing medical, radiation, and surgical oncologists in the United States. Data were analyzed from 100 responses. When available, the overall utilization of EUS for staging nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was significantly low (19.0%), although available. When EUS was unavailable, majority of the patients with pancreatobiliary cancer (79%; P<0.01) were not referred for staging, unlike those with esophageal (57.9%) and rectal cancer (73.7%) were. EUS availability did not impact its use in staging gastric cancer. Majority of the respondents thought EUS made an impact in managing patients with rectal (89.5%), esophageal (84.5%), and pancreatobiliary cancers (58.5%) but not gastric (54.7%) or NSCLC (61.5%). In staging NSCLC, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspirate (35.7%) and mediastinoscopy (34.7%) were noted as the most accurate for tissue sampling of lymph nodes in levels 5, 7, and 8. EUS was deemed better than computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging by 42% in detecting small pancreatic tumors. Majority have not referred patients for EUS-guided celiac plexus neurolysis for palliation of pain in unresectable pancreatic cancer.

Historically, these tubes were placed during resection of head and neck cancer for postoperative nutrition. The technique may also be used to manage a variety of complications following esophagectomy or gastric surgery. A retrospective review identified all patients who underwent pharyngostomy tube placement at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center from 1995 to 2007. Indications, procedure-related complications, and duration of tube placement were recorded. Thirty-eight patients were identified. Indications for tube placement were: access for enteral nutrition (n = 18), drainage of mediastinal abscess (n = 4), gastric decompression (n = 13), and other (n = 3). Procedure-related complications included: cellulitis (n = 1), esophagitis (n = 1), aspiration pneumonia (n = 1), and tube migration (n = 9). Duration of tube placement was 51 days (range 1-279).

Neuroendocrine differentiation was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining. The NEC component was classified into small-cell and large-cell subtypes, and non-neuroendocrine components were evaluated. Patients with locoregional disease were treated with chemoradiation with or without surgery or with surgery only. Patients with distant metastasis were treated with systemic therapy. The extent of residual tumors was evaluated in esophagectomy specimens after preoperative chemoradiation. Twenty-seven patients had large-cell NEC, and 13 had small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. An adenocarcinoma component was present in 15 patients and squamous carcinoma component in 1 patient. Synaptophysin was positive in all cases, and chromogranin was positive in 31 cases.

Radiation treatment breaks and ulcerative mucositis in head and neck cancer.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2008-08-13,"Unplanned radiation treatment breaks and prolongation of the radiation treatment time are associated with lower survival and locoregional control rates when radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy is used in the curative treatment of head and neck cancer. Treatment of head and neck cancer is intense, involving high-dose, continuous radiotherapy, and often adding chemotherapy to radiotherapy. As the intensity of treatment regimens has escalated in recent years, clinical outcomes generally have improved. However, more intensive therapy also increases the incidence of treatment-related toxicities, particularly those impacting the mucosal lining of the oral cavity, pharynx, and cervical esophagus, and results in varying degrees of ulcerative mucositis. Ulcerative mucositis is a root cause of unscheduled radiation treatment breaks, which prolongs the total radiation treatment time. Alterations in radiotherapy and chemotherapy, including the use of continuous (i.e., 7 days/week) radiotherapy to ensure constant negative proliferative pressure, may improve efficacy outcomes. However, these approaches also increase the incidence of ulcerative mucositis, thereby increasing the incidence of unplanned radiation treatment breaks. Conversely, the reduction of ulcerative mucositis to minimize unplanned breaks in radiotherapy may enhance not only tolerability, but also efficacy outcomes.

Adenoviral endoplasmic reticulum-targeted mda-7/interleukin-24 vector enhances human cancer cell killing.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2008-08-01,"We developed several adenoviral vectors designed to target MDA-7 expression to different subcellular compartments [endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, nucleus, and cytosol] and evaluated their ability to enhance apoptosis. Adenoviral ER-targeted mda-7/interleukin-24 vector (Ad-ER-mda7) selectively and effectively inhibited the growth and proliferation of lung (A549 and H1299) and esophageal (Seg1 and Bic1) cancer cells by enhancing cell killing. Both Ad-mda7 and Ad-ER-mda7 activated a novel pathway of ER stress-induced apoptosis characterized by unregulated expression of phosphorylated JNK, phosphorylated c-Jun, and phosphorylated RNA-dependent protein kinase. Caspase-4 activation mediated Ad-mda7- and Ad-ER-mda7-induced cell death. In addition, Ad-mda7- and Ad-ER-mda7-mediated growth inhibition correlated with activation of ER molecular markers RNA-dependent protein kinase and JNK both in vitro (in Ad-mda7- or Ad-ER-mda7-treated lung cancer cells) and in vivo.

Pharmacol.,2008-10-08,"To define dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of capecitabine with fixed-dose rate (FDR) gemcitabine. Eligible adults (advanced solid tumor; performance status <or=2) received capecitabine 500 mg/m(2) PO BID days 1-14 and FDR gemcitabine (400-1,000 mg/m(2) escalated by 200 mg/m(2) increments) at 10 mg/m(2)/min days 1 and 8 on a 21-day cycle. A traditional 3 + 3 cohort design was used to determine the MTD. Thirty patients (median age 59 years) were enrolled. The predominant grade >or=3 toxicity was myelosuppression, particularly neutropenia. At dose level 4 (1,000 mg/m(2) gemcitabine), two out of five evaluable patients had a DLT (grade 4 neutropenia >or=7 days). At dose level 3 (800 mg/m(2) gemcitabine), one patient had a DLT (grade 3 neutropenia >or=7 days) among six evaluable patients.

Recent larger series have shown MIE to be equivalent in postoperative morbidity and mortality rates to conventional surgery. MIE has been associated with less blood loss, less postoperative pain, and decreased intensive care unit and hospital length of stay compared with conventional surgery.

Thirty patients with metastatic or locally advanced (unresectable or recurrent) gastrointestinal solid tumors were enrolled on this single-center, phase I study. Patients were treated with paclitaxel given over 1h at 1 of 4 dose levels (40, 50, 65, or 80 mg/m(2)). Paclitaxel was followed by fixed doses of cisplatin (30 mg/m(2)) and irinotecan (50 mg/m(2)). All treatment was administered sequentially, once a week, in 6-week cycles (4 weeks on, 2 weeks off). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as a 2-week delay in treatment for grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity, neutropenic fever, a 1-week delay for grade 4 hematologic toxicity, or a 2-week delay for grade 3 hematologic toxicity. Thirty patients were recruited; 28 patients were assessable for safety. Most of the patients (70%) had no prior chemotherapy. The primary first-cycle DLTs were neutropenia, diarrhea, and nausea. Paclitaxel at 65 mg/m(2) was defined as the MTD. The most common grade 3-4 toxicities observed during all cycles were neutropenia (57%), febrile neutropenia (11%), diarrhea (29%), fatigue (29%), and nausea (18%). No patients had G-CSF (Neupogen, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA) support. Responses were observed in gastric, esophageal, and pancreatic cancers. Paclitaxel at 65 mg/m(2), cisplatin (30 mg/m(2)), and irinotecan (50 mg/m(2)) given weekly can be safely administered to patients with solid tumor malignancies.

The impact of tumor VEGF and FLT expression (< or =10% vs. > 10%) and five additional potential prognostic factors on overaLL survival (OS) and Locoregional control (LC) was retrospectively evaluated. These factors included T-stage (T3 vs. T4), N-stage (NO vs. N1), treatment (radiochemotherapy plus resection vs. radiochemotherapy alone), erythropoietin (ERYPO 10000, Janssen-Cilag, Neuss, Germany) administration during radiotherapy, and majority of hemoglobin levels during radiotherapy (<12 vs. > or =12 g/dl). Subgroup analyses were performed for patients receiving resection (R0 vs. R1/2 resection). The factors found to be significant on univariate analyses (Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test) were included in multivariate analyses performed with the Cox proportional hazard model. On univariate analysis, improved OS was associated with T3 stage (p = 0.011), surgery (p = 0.019), and hemoglobin > or =12 g/dl (p < 0.001).

Induction chemotherapy in locally advanced head and neck cancer: a new standard of care?,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,Hematol. Oncol. Clin. North Am.,2008-12-01,"Locally advanced squamous cell cancer of the head and neck is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite progress through the use of multimodality treatment involving surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy in recent years, the survival remains poor, and treatment-related morbidity-mainly caused by radiation-induced effects such as soft tissue scarring, esophageal stenosis, xerostomia, dental decay, and osteoradionecrosis-is a major problem in long-term survivors. Data from early trials and encouraging results from meta-analyses have revived interest in the use of neoadjuvant or induction chemotherapy before definitive local treatment. Recent randomized trials have demonstrated marked improvements in survival with the addition of the taxane docetaxel (Taxotere) to the traditional induction regimen consisting of cisplatin and 5FU (TPF) compared with cisplatin and 5FU (PF) alone and have established a new standard of care. The newer TPF induction chemotherapy regimens also appear to be tolerated better than PF when accompanied by adequate supportive measures.

Modeling using baseline characteristics in a small multicenter clinical trial for Barrett's esophagus.,Contemporary clinical trials,Contemp Clin Trials,2008-11-01,"Utilizing data obtained during a multicenter investigation, this paper illustrates how the use of covariates and careful modeling techniques can be useful in assessing whether a negative outcome from a small multicenter clinical trial could be due to imbalance in baseline characteristics. The Chemoprevention for Barrett's Esophagus Trial (CBET) was a phase IIb, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of celecoxib in patients with Barrett's esophagus. The primary outcomes for the original study were the proportion of biopsy samples exhibiting dysplasia in the celecoxib and placebo groups. The secondary and tertiary outcomes included histologic change and measurements of biologically relevant markers, including COX-1 and -2 mRNA, prostanoid levels, and methylation of tumor suppressor genes p16, APC, and E-cadherin. The original study reported no significant differences in primary, secondary or tertiary outcomes. In this paper, we focus on the results of one of the secondary measures, quantitative endoscopy (QE). The study utilizes data from 56 patients in the CBET for whom baseline (BL) QE and one-year follow-up QE (F04) studies were performed. Of these, 29 were treated with celecoxib (200 mg twice daily for a minimum of 48 weeks) and 27 received the placebo. These patients are segmented as to the presence or absence of circumferential, tongues or islands of Barrett's. The response of interest is total affected area at one year (Total F04); affected area at baseline (Total BL) is used as a covariate. Controlling for complexity and clinic, there is a significant treatment effect. In addition, there is significant evidence that the area of Barrett's involvement decreased for patients in the treatment group. That there was a decrease for the celecoxib over the placebo group adds to the body of evidence that relates COX-2 specific inhibitors and cancer incidence.",Journal Article,4098.0,7.0,Utilizing data obtained during a multicenter investigation this paper illustrates how the use of covariates and careful modeling techniques can be useful in assessing whether a negative outcome from a small multicenter clinical trial could be due to imbalance in baseline characteristics The Chemoprevention for Barrett 's Trial CBET was a phase IIb multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial of celecoxib in patients with Barrett 's The primary outcomes for the original study were the proportion of biopsy samples exhibiting dysplasia in the celecoxib and placebo groups The secondary and tertiary outcomes included histologic change and measurements of biologically relevant markers including COX-1 and -2 mRNA prostanoid levels and methylation of tumor suppressor genes p16 APC and E-cadherin The original study reported no significant differences in primary secondary or tertiary outcomes In this paper we focus on the results of one of the secondary measures quantitative endoscopy QE The study utilizes data from 56 patients in the CBET for whom baseline BL QE and one-year follow-up QE F04 studies were performed Of these 29 were treated with celecoxib 200 mg twice daily for a minimum of 48 weeks and 27 received the placebo These patients are segmented as to the presence or absence of circumferential tongues or islands of Barrett 's The response of interest is total affected area at one year Total F04 affected area at baseline Total BL is used as a covariate Controlling for complexity and clinic there is a significant treatment effect In addition there is significant evidence that the area of Barrett 's involvement decreased for patients in the treatment group That there was a decrease for the celecoxib over the placebo group adds to the body of evidence that relates COX-2 specific inhibitors and cancer incidence,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[2600, 74, 683, 190, 8, 1570, 940, 26, 2817, 6342, 832, 3, 119, 1, 2489, 2, 3465, 2057, 1092, 122, 40, 999, 4, 1977, 317, 8, 199, 228, 29, 8, 302, 1570, 38, 160, 359, 40, 520, 6, 6088, 4, 330, 374, 3, 2886, 9, 4366, 292, 160, 31080, 10, 8, 124, 3884, 1570, 384, 619, 1149, 160, 1, 2673, 4, 7, 5, 4366, 292, 3, 86, 123, 9, 3, 2279, 45, 11, 3, 920, 1, 411, 347, 4801, 2253, 4, 3, 2673, 2, 619, 271, 3, 568, 2, 2557, 123, 159, 884, 707, 2, 1685, 1, 2665, 867, 525, 141, 418, 14, 2, 18, 956, 31374, 148, 2, 569, 1, 30, 1245, 214, 1932, 2528, 2, 563, 2154, 3, 2279, 45, 210, 77, 93, 362, 4, 86, 568, 15, 2557, 123, 4, 26, 2817, 21, 1222, 23, 3, 99, 1, 104, 1, 3, 568, 1018, 1156, 4199, 26710, 3, 45, 9639, 74, 29, 664, 7, 4, 3, 31080, 9, 953, 330, 6331, 26710, 2, 104, 111, 166, 126, 26710, 45322, 94, 11, 173, 1, 46, 462, 11, 73, 5, 2673, 1250, 81, 936, 391, 9, 8, 2499, 1, 576, 244, 2, 428, 103, 3, 619, 46, 7, 32, 9199, 22, 6, 3, 463, 15, 1127, 1, 7937, 23074, 15, 6046, 1, 4366, 292, 3, 51, 1, 1333, 16, 181, 1424, 965, 28, 104, 111, 181, 45322, 1424, 965, 28, 330, 181, 6331, 16, 95, 22, 8, 6322, 1893, 9, 3082, 2, 1188, 125, 16, 8, 93, 24, 254, 4, 352, 125, 16, 93, 241, 17, 3, 965, 1, 4366, 292, 799, 340, 9, 7, 4, 3, 24, 87, 17, 125, 10, 8, 775, 9, 3, 2673, 252, 3, 619, 87, 6659, 6, 3, 642, 1, 241, 17, 9228, 418, 18, 112, 222, 2, 12, 287]",1839.0,19013259,162
Impact of manual and automated interpretation of fused PET/CT data on esophageal target definitions in radiation planning.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2008-12-01,"We compare CT-only based esophageal tumor definition with two PET/CT based methods: (1) manual contouring and (2) a semiautomated method based on specific thresholds. Patients with esophageal cancer treated at Brigham and Women's Hospital from 2003 to 2006 were identified. CT-based tumor volumes were compared with manual PET/CT-based volumes and semiautomated PET-based tumor volumes. Differences were scored as (1) minor if the superior or inferior extent of the primary tumor (or both) differed by 1-2 cm and (2) major if the difference was > 2 cm or if different noncontiguous nodal regions were identified as being grossly involved. Comparing CT-based gross tumor volumes (GTVs) to manually defined PET/CT-based GTVs, use of PET changed volumes for 21 of 25 (84%) patients: 12 patients (48%) exhibited minor differences, whereas for 9 patients (36%), the differences were major.

Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy continues to be investigated and is associated with several advantages over neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone, including an improvement in the pathologic complete response rate and resectability; patients who achieve a pathologic complete response also appear to have improved survival.

Slit2 inhibits growth and metastasis of fibrosarcoma and squamous cell carcinoma.,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",Neoplasia,2008-12-01,"Slits are a group of secreted glycoproteins that play a role in the regulation of cell migration. Previous studies suggested that Slit2 might be a tumor-suppressor gene. However, it remained to be determined whether Slit2 suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in animal models. We showed that Slit2 expression was decreased or abolished in human esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) compared to normal tissues by in situ hybridization. Stable transfection of human SCC A431 and fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells with Slit2 gene suppressed tumor growth in athymic nude mice. Apoptosis in Slit2-transfected tumors was increased, whereas proliferating cells were decreased, suggesting a mechanism for Slit2-mediated tumor suppression. This was supported by further analysis indicating that antiapoptotic molecules Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl and cell cycle molecules Cdk6 and Cyclin D1 were down-regulated in Slit2-transfected tumors. Furthermore, wound healing and Matrigel invasion assays showed that the transfection with Slit2 inhibited tumor cell migration and invasion. Slit2-transfected tumors showed a high level of keratin 8/18 and a low level of N-cadherin expression compared to empty vector-transfected tumors. More importantly, Slit2 transfection suppressed the metastasis of HT1080 tumor cells in lungs after intravenous inoculation.

Paclitaxel were given intravenously at a dose of 135 mg/m(2) for 3 h on day1 and day 22. Cisplatin was given intravenously at a dose of 20 mg/m(2) on D1-D3 and D22-24. 4 - 6 weeks after the completion of chemo-radiotherapy, left thoracic incision and transhiatal esophagectomy with anastomosis in the neck was performed. The patients were followed up for 42.28 months. Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), and Log-rank test was performed to assess the survival rates statistical significance among groups. The radical resection rate was 96.15%. The pathologic response to chemoradiotherapy were grade I in 9 patients, grade II in 6 patients, and grade III in 11 patients. The pathological complete remission (PCR) rate was 42.31% (11/26). Toxicity grade 3 - 4 included leucopenia (7.69%, 2/26), thrombocytopenia (7.69%, 2/26), and radiation esophagitis (11.54%, 3/26).

Promoter methylation of HIN-1 in the progression to esophageal squamous cancer.,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,2008-11-08,"HIN-1 (High in normal-1) is a tumor suppressor gene that is highly expressed in many epithelial tissues, including breast lung, trachea, pancreas, prostrate and salivary gland. Inactivation of HIN-1 expression by promoter methylation is frequent in many epithelial carcinomas and carcinoma-in-situ, including breast, lung and nasopharyngeal. Because HIN-1 silencing commences at an early stage of malignant transformation in these tissues, it may be a useful marker for tumor presence. The status of HIN-1 regulation in esophageal cancer has not been previously reported. Thus, we analyzed 18 esophageal cancer cell lines for HIN-1 expression and methylation by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and methylation specific PCR (MSP). HIN-1 gene silencing and promoter methylation was present in 13 (72%) of the cell lines. Bisulfite-treated sequencing confirmed the methylation status in cell lines and demonstrated dense methylation of HIN-1 throughout the promoter region. Epigenetic changes of HIN-1 were examined throughout the progression of carcinogenesis in esophageal squamous lesions through analysis of archived surgical specimens from patients with normal esophageal mucosa (n = 17), grade I dysplasia (n = 39), grade II dysplasia (n = 12), grade III dysplasia (n = 9), and invasive squamous esophageal cancer (n = 126). Methylation of HIN-1 was present in 0% of normal mucosa, 31% of grade I dysplasia, 33% of grade II dysplasia, 44% of grade III dysplasia, and 50% of esophageal cancer specimens analyzed. These studies demonstrate HIN-1 silencing is associated with dense promoter region hypermethylation in esophageal cancer and suggest that methylation of HIN-1 is an early event in dysplastic transformation.",Journal Article,4091.0,36.0,HIN-1 High in normal-1 is a tumor suppressor gene that is highly expressed in many epithelial tissues including trachea prostrate and gland Inactivation of HIN-1 expression by promoter methylation is frequent in many epithelial carcinomas and carcinoma-in-situ including and Because HIN-1 silencing commences at an early stage of malignant transformation in these tissues it may be a useful marker for tumor presence The status of HIN-1 regulation in cancer has not been previously reported Thus we analyzed 18 cancer cell lines for HIN-1 expression and methylation by reverse transcription PCR RT-PCR and methylation specific PCR MSP HIN-1 gene silencing and promoter methylation was present in 13 72 of the cell lines Bisulfite-treated sequencing confirmed the methylation status in cell lines and demonstrated dense methylation of HIN-1 throughout the promoter region Epigenetic changes of HIN-1 were examined throughout the progression of carcinogenesis in squamous lesions through analysis of archived surgical specimens from patients with normal mucosa n 17 grade I dysplasia n 39 grade II dysplasia n 12 grade III dysplasia n 9 and invasive squamous cancer n 126 Methylation of HIN-1 was present in 0 of normal mucosa 31 of grade I dysplasia 33 of grade II dysplasia 44 of grade III dysplasia and 50 of cancer specimens analyzed These studies demonstrate HIN-1 silencing is associated with dense promoter region hypermethylation in cancer and suggest that methylation of HIN-1 is an early event in dysplastic transformation,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[9991, 14, 64, 4, 295, 14, 16, 8, 30, 1245, 145, 17, 16, 561, 570, 4, 445, 701, 742, 141, 15869, 44344, 2, 2326, 2297, 1, 9991, 14, 55, 20, 973, 569, 16, 908, 4, 445, 701, 826, 2, 134, 4, 957, 141, 2, 408, 9991, 14, 2077, 38578, 28, 35, 191, 82, 1, 393, 1392, 4, 46, 742, 192, 68, 40, 8, 999, 952, 9, 30, 463, 3, 156, 1, 9991, 14, 863, 4, 12, 71, 44, 85, 373, 210, 631, 21, 311, 203, 12, 31, 285, 9, 9991, 14, 55, 2, 569, 20, 1772, 866, 604, 240, 604, 2, 569, 112, 604, 8858, 9991, 14, 145, 2077, 2, 973, 569, 10, 364, 4, 233, 720, 1, 3, 31, 285, 6181, 73, 615, 557, 3, 569, 156, 4, 31, 285, 2, 264, 3076, 569, 1, 9991, 14, 2432, 3, 973, 1053, 1418, 400, 1, 9991, 14, 11, 409, 2432, 3, 91, 1, 1719, 4, 691, 406, 298, 65, 1, 6282, 221, 623, 29, 7, 5, 295, 2713, 78, 269, 88, 70, 2253, 78, 587, 88, 215, 2253, 78, 133, 88, 316, 2253, 78, 83, 2, 416, 691, 12, 78, 3927, 569, 1, 9991, 14, 10, 364, 4, 13, 1, 295, 2713, 456, 1, 88, 70, 2253, 466, 1, 88, 215, 2253, 584, 1, 88, 316, 2253, 2, 212, 1, 12, 623, 311, 46, 94, 608, 9991, 14, 2077, 16, 41, 5, 3076, 973, 1053, 2575, 4, 12, 2, 309, 17, 569, 1, 9991, 14, 16, 35, 191, 774, 4, 6461, 1392]",1530.0,19098448,19
Esophageal tumor length is independently associated with long-term survival.,Cancer,Cancer,2009-02-01,"Esophageal cancer staging uses tumor depth as the sole criterion for assessment of the primary tumor (pT). To the authors' knowledge the impact of esophageal tumor length on long-term outcome and the esophageal cancer staging system has not been fully evaluated in the current era. All esophageal cancer patients (n = 209) undergoing surgery from 1995 to 2005 who did not receive preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy were reviewed. Maximum esophageal tumor length along a craniocaudal axis was determined pathologically after surgical resection. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the impact of esophageal tumor length (< or = 3 cm vs >3 cm) on long-term survival. Esophageal tumor length was closely associated with long-term survival (hazards ratio [HR] of 6.14 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 4.1-9.25]; 5-year survival: < or = 3 cm = 68%, >3 cm = 10% [P < .001]). Multivariate Cox regression analyses demonstrated tumor length (HR of 2.13 [95% CI, 1.26-3.63]) was found to be a significant independent predictor of long-term survival even when controlled for sex, age, tumor location, histology, margin positivity, surgical procedure, and current pTNM criteria. The incorporation of tumor length in pTNM staging significantly improves the ability to predict the long-term survival of patients (5-year survival for patients with tumors < or = 3 cm and stages I, IIA, IIB, and III disease = 86%, 62%, 49%, and 22%, respectively; survival for patients with tumors measuring >3 cm and stages I, IIA, IIB, and III disease = 27%, 22%, 0%, and 8%, respectively [P < .1]).

Influence of the baseline 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography results on survival and pathologic response in patients with gastroesophageal cancer undergoing chemoradiation.,Cancer,Cancer,2009-02-01,"In patients with esophageal cancer who receive chemoradiation, tools to predict/prognosticate outcome before administering therapy are lacking. The authors evaluated initial standardized unit value (iSUV) of 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography and its association with overall survival and the degree of pathologic response after surgery. The authors analyzed 161 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma who had chemoradiation followed by surgery. The log-rank test, univariate Cox proportional hazards model, Kaplan-Meier survival plot, and Fisher exact test were used to analyze dichotomized iSUV and its association with overall survival and pathologic response. The median age of 161 patients was 61 years (range, 26-80 years) and the majority of patients had lower esophageal or gastroesophageal junction involvement. All patients received fluoropyrimidine and, most commonly, a taxane or platinum compound with concomitant radiation. The median radiation dose was 45 grays (Gy) (range, 45 Gy-50.4 Gy). The median iSUV for all patients was 10.1 (range, 0-58). Using the Fisher exact test, iSUV was not found to be associated with the location of the primary cancer. iSUV higher than the median (10.1) was associated with a better pathologic response (P = .06).

Genetic variations in microRNA-related genes are novel susceptibility loci for esophageal cancer risk.,"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",Cancer Prev Res (Phila),2008-11-01,"MicroRNAs (miRNA) can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors and modulate the expression of approximately one third of all human genes. To test the hypothesis that adverse alleles in miRNA-related genes may increase the risk for esophageal cancer, we assessed the associations between esophageal cancer risk and 41 potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 26 miRNA-related genes in a case-control study of 346 Caucasian esophageal cancer patients (85.5% with esophageal adenocarcinoma) and 346 frequency-matched (age, gender, and ethnicity) controls. Seven SNPs were significantly associated with esophageal cancer risk. The most notable finding was that the SNP rs6505162, which is located in the pre-mir423 region, was associated with a per-allele odds ratio of 0.64 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.51-0.80; P for trend < 0.0001]. This association remained significant after we corrected for multiple comparisons. A common haplotype of the GEMIN4 gene was associated with a significantly reduced risk of esophageal cancer (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.42-0.99). We did a combined unfavorable genotype analysis to further evaluate the cumulative effects of the promising (risk associated) SNPs. In comparison with the low-risk group (fewer than three unfavorable genotypes), the medium-risk group (three unfavorable genotypes) had a 2.00-fold (95% CI, 1.31-3.08) increased risk and the high-risk group (more than three unfavorable genotypes) had a 3.14-fold (95% CI, 2.03-4.85) increased risk (P for trend < 0.0001). Results for the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma were similar to the overall risk results.

PAX5 is expressed in small-cell lung cancer and positively regulates c-Met transcription.,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,Lab. Invest.,2009-01-12,"PAX5 is a nuclear transcription factor required for B cell development, and its expression was evaluated in upper aerodigestive malignancies and pancreatic cancer by immunoblotting. The PAX5 protein expression was relatively strong in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC, 11/12); however, its expression was not detected in non-SCLC (NSCLC, n=13), mesothelioma (n=7), pancreatic (n=6), esophageal (n=6) and head and neck cancer cell lines (n=12). In comparison, PAX8 and PAX3 expressions were absent or non-detectable in SCLC cell lines; however, PAX8 was expressed in most of the tested NSCLC cell lines (13/13) and also frequently in all the other cell lines. We also detected frequent expressions of PAX2 and PAX9 protein in the various cell lines. Utilizing neuroendocrine tumor samples, we found that the frequency as well as the average intensity of the expression of PAX5 increased from pulmonary carcinoid (9%, moderate and strong PAX5 expression, n=44), to large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNC, 27%, n=11) to SCLC (33%, n=76). FISH analysis revealed no translocations of the PAX5 gene, but polyploidy in some SCLC tumor tissues (6/37). We determined that PAX5 could regulate the transcription of c-Met using luciferase-coupled reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. In addition, the phospho-c-Met (active form) and PAX5 were both localized to the same intra-nuclear compartment in hepatocyte growth factor treated SCLC cells and interacted with each other. Finally, we determined the therapeutic translational potential of PAX5 using PAX5 knockdown SCLC cells in conjunction with Topoisomerase 1 (SN38) and c-Met (SU11274) inhibitors. Loss of endogenous PAX5 significantly decreased the viability of SCLC cells, especially when combined with SN38 or SU11274, and maximum effect was seen when both inhibitors were used. Therefore, we propose that PAX5 could be an important regulator of c-Met transcription and a potential target for therapy in SCLC.",Journal Article,4026.0,67.0,PAX5 is a nuclear transcription factor required for B cell development and its expression was evaluated in upper aerodigestive malignancies and cancer by immunoblotting The PAX5 protein expression was relatively strong in small-cell cancer SCLC 11/12 however its expression was not detected in non-SCLC NSCLC n=13 n=7 n=6 n=6 and head and cancer cell lines n=12 In comparison PAX8 and PAX3 expressions were absent or non-detectable in SCLC cell lines however PAX8 was expressed in most of the tested NSCLC cell lines 13/13 and also frequently in all the other cell lines We also detected frequent expressions of PAX2 and PAX9 protein in the various cell lines Utilizing neuroendocrine tumor samples we found that the frequency as well as the average intensity of the expression of PAX5 increased from pulmonary 9 moderate and strong PAX5 expression n=44 to large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma LCNC 27 n=11 to SCLC 33 n=76 FISH analysis revealed no translocations of the PAX5 gene but polyploidy in some SCLC tumor tissues 6/37 We determined that PAX5 could regulate the transcription of c-Met using luciferase-coupled reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis In addition the phospho-c-Met active form and PAX5 were both localized to the same intra-nuclear compartment in growth factor treated SCLC cells and interacted with each other Finally we determined the therapeutic translational potential of PAX5 using PAX5 knockdown SCLC cells in conjunction with Topoisomerase 1 SN38 and c-Met SU11274 inhibitors Loss of endogenous PAX5 significantly decreased the viability of SCLC cells especially when combined with SN38 or SU11274 and maximum effect was seen when both inhibitors were used Therefore we propose that PAX5 could be an important regulator of c-Met transcription and a potential target for therapy in SCLC,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[6279, 16, 8, 928, 866, 161, 616, 9, 132, 31, 193, 2, 211, 55, 10, 194, 4, 1726, 11006, 441, 2, 12, 20, 5293, 3, 6279, 178, 55, 10, 1352, 1082, 4, 302, 31, 12, 1334, 175, 133, 137, 211, 55, 10, 44, 530, 4, 220, 1334, 304, 78, 233, 78, 67, 78, 49, 78, 49, 2, 718, 2, 12, 31, 285, 78, 133, 4, 1155, 8958, 2, 8424, 4249, 11, 3269, 15, 220, 2083, 4, 1334, 31, 285, 137, 8958, 10, 570, 4, 96, 1, 3, 650, 304, 31, 285, 233, 233, 2, 120, 746, 4, 62, 3, 127, 31, 285, 21, 120, 530, 908, 4249, 1, 15730, 2, 45395, 178, 4, 3, 747, 31, 285, 2600, 1542, 30, 347, 21, 204, 17, 3, 675, 22, 149, 22, 3, 1011, 837, 1, 3, 55, 1, 6279, 101, 29, 1087, 83, 1163, 2, 1082, 6279, 55, 78, 584, 6, 375, 31, 1542, 134, 45396, 428, 78, 175, 6, 1334, 466, 78, 846, 1277, 65, 553, 77, 3262, 1, 3, 6279, 145, 84, 24874, 4, 476, 1334, 30, 742, 49, 567, 21, 509, 17, 6279, 359, 2288, 3, 866, 1, 256, 543, 75, 3864, 3332, 3674, 2, 2287, 4857, 65, 4, 352, 3, 3125, 256, 543, 544, 1297, 2, 6279, 11, 110, 909, 6, 3, 827, 2392, 928, 3616, 4, 129, 161, 73, 1334, 37, 2, 7940, 5, 296, 127, 1368, 21, 509, 3, 189, 2460, 174, 1, 6279, 75, 6279, 1563, 1334, 37, 4, 3357, 5, 3999, 14, 10557, 2, 256, 543, 11496, 222, 407, 1, 2682, 6279, 97, 340, 3, 2120, 1, 1334, 37, 1093, 198, 397, 5, 10557, 15, 11496, 2, 689, 254, 10, 527, 198, 110, 222, 11, 95, 673, 21, 2548, 17, 6279, 359, 40, 35, 305, 2452, 1, 256, 543, 866, 2, 8, 174, 283, 9, 36, 4, 1334]",1827.0,19139719,699
Frequent loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 1q in esophageal adenocarcinoma: loss of chromosome 1q21.3 is associated with shorter overall survival.,Cancer,Cancer,2009-04-01,"Previous microarray expression profiling studies have shown that genes located on chromosome region 1q21-23 were down-regulated in the progression of Barrett esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma and that, among patients with the latter condition, these genes were differentially expressed between responders and nonresponders of preoperative chemoradiation therapy. It was unclear whether this difference was due to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or to other genetic alterations at this locus. The status of chromosome 1q LOH was retrospectively evaluated in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded pretreatment biopsy specimens from 33 patients with locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma who were treated with preoperative neoadjuvant therapy, and the findings were correlated with clinicopathologic features and overall survival duration. LOH was determined by polymerase chain reaction analysis of 7 dinucleotide microsatellite markers that spanned chromosomal region 1q21-23. Allelic loss of chromosome 1q with any marker was found in 66% of tumors; 58% of tumors demonstrated loss of chromosome 1q21, and 45% of tumors demonstrated loss of chromosome 1q23.

Genetic variations in the PI3K/PTEN/AKT/mTOR pathway are associated with clinical outcomes in esophageal cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-01-21,"The phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway has been implicated in resistance to several chemotherapeutic agents. In this retrospective study, we determined whether common genetic variations in this pathway are associated with clinical outcomes in esophageal cancer patients with adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma who have undergone chemoradiotherapy and surgery. Sixteen tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PIK3CA, PTEN, AKT1, AKT2, and FRAP1 (encoding mTOR) were genotyped in these patients and analyzed for associations with response to therapy, survival, and recurrence. We observed an increased recurrence risk with genetic variations in AKT1 and AKT2 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.21; 95% CI, 1.06 to 4.60; and HR, 3.30; 95% CI, 1.64 to 6.66, respectively). This effect was magnified with an increasing number of AKT adverse genotypes. In contrast, a predictable protective effect by PTEN genetic variants on recurrence was evident. Survival tree analysis identified higher-order interactions that resulted in variation in recurrence-free survival from 12 to 42 months, depending on the combination of SNPs. Genetic variations in AKT1, AKT2, and FRAP1 were associated with survival. Patients homozygous for either of the FRAP1 SNPs assayed had a more than three-fold increased risk of death. Two genes--AKT2 and FRAP1--were associated with a poor treatment response, while a better response was associated with heterozygosity for AKT1:rs3803304 (odds ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.99). These results suggest that common genetic variations in this pathway modulate clinical outcomes in patients who undergo chemoradiotherapy.

Redox Signal.,2009-05-01,"Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a highly lethal cancer in western countries. EAC cells are believed to develop from esophageal epithelial cells through complex transformation processes involving inflammation and oxidative stress. The purpose of this study was to compare the redox status of malignant and nonmalignant esophageal epithelial cells and to test their responses to bile acid-induced oxidative stress and to treatment with honokiol (HNK), a natural product with anticancer activity. We demonstrated that esophageal adenocarcinoma cells express significantly higher levels of antioxidant molecules and were resistant to reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress induced by bile acid, but were sensitive to the cytotoxic action of HNK. Mechanistic study showed that HNK caused cancer cell death by disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and was correlated with cyclophilin D (CypD) expression. Inhibition of CypD by cyclosporin A or abrogation of its expression by siRNA significantly suppressed the cytotoxicity of HNK, suggesting that CypD may be a key molecule that mediates the cytotoxicity.

Genetic susceptibility to esophageal cancer: the role of the nucleotide excision repair pathway.,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,2009-03-06,"In this case-control study with 387 White esophageal patients and 462 White controls matched to cases by age and sex, we evaluated the associations between 13 potential functional polymorphisms in eight major nucleotide excision repair (NER) genes and esophageal cancer risk. In individual single nucleotide polymorphism analysis, after adjustment for multiple comparisons, the heterozygous GT genotype of the ERCC1 3' untranslated region (UTR) was associated with an increased risk, whereas the homozygous variant genotype TT was associated with 60% reduction in risk with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.40 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.19-0.86). The heterozygous AG genotype of XPA 5' UTR was at 2.11-fold increased risk (95% CI = 1.33-3.35) and the risk reached 3.10-fold (95% CI = 1.94-4.95) for the homozygous variant GG genotype. These associations were also significant when restricted the analyses in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma.

Although surgery remains a cornerstone of treatment, recent studies have demonstrated that pre- or perioperative chemotherapy is associated with improved survival for patients who have adenocarcinoma histology. Primary chemoradiotherapy is the accepted standard of care for medically inoperable patients. Recent studies also suggest that definitive chemoradiotherapy is acceptable for patients who have squamous histology, while subsequent surgery improves local control without conferring a clear survival benefit. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy continues to be investigated but is associated with several advantages over neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone, including an improvement in the pathologic complete response rate and resectability.

MicroRNA-196a is a potential marker of progression during Barrett's metaplasia-dysplasia-invasive adenocarcinoma sequence in esophagus.,The American journal of pathology,Am. J. Pathol.,2009-03-26,"Barrett's esophagus (BE)/Barrett's metaplasia (BM) is a recognized precursor of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) with an intermediary stage of dysplasia. The low yield and high cost of endoscopic screening of patients with BE underscores the need for novel biomarkers, such as microRNA (miRNA), which have emerged as important players in neoplastic progression for risk assessment of developing dysplasia/adenocarcinoma. Recently, we reported highly elevated levels of miRNA-196a (miR-196a) in EA and demonstrated its growth-promoting and anti-apoptotic functions. Here, we evaluated miR-196a as a marker of BE progression to low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, and EA using microdissected paraffin-embedded tissues from 11 patients. Higher levels of miR-196a were observed in EA, BE, and dysplastic lesions compared with normal squamous mucosa, and in high-grade dysplasia compared with BE and low-grade dysplasia. Using frozen tumor tissues from 10 additional patients who had advanced EA, we evaluated the correlation of miR-196a with its in silico-predicted targets, keratin 5 (KRT5), small proline-rich protein 2C (SPRR2C), and S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9), which are down-regulated during BE progression. MiR-196a levels inversely correlated with the predicted target mRNA levels in EA. We confirmed that miR-196a specifically targets KRT5, SPRR2C, and S100A9 3' UTRs using miR-196a-mimic and luciferase reporter-based assays.

Respiratory motion was measured in the superior-inferior (SI), anterior-posterior (AP), and left-right (LR) directions and was analyzed for correlation with anatomic location. Recommended margin expansions were determined for both primary and nodal targets. Thirty patients underwent 4D CT scans at Massachusetts General Hospital for planned curative treatment of esophageal cancer. Measurements of respiratory tumor motion were obtained for 1 proximal, 4 mid-, and 25 distal esophageal tumors, as well as 12 involved celiac-region lymph nodes. The mean (SD) peak-to-peak displacements of all primary tumors in the SI, AP, and LR dimensions were 0.80 (0.45) cm, 0.28 (0.20) cm, and 0.22 (0.23) cm, respectively.

"Phase II study of tirapazamine, cisplatin, and etoposide and concurrent thoracic radiotherapy for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer: SWOG 0222.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-04-13,"A SWOG pilot study (S0004) showed that tirapazamine (TPZ) when combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy yielded a promising median survival of 22 months in limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (LSCLC). We report results of the phase II study designed to confirm this result. The concurrent phase consisted of two cycles of cisplatin, etoposide, and once-daily radiation to 61 Gy. TPZ was given at 260 mg/m(2) on days 1, 29, and at 160 mg/m(2) on days 8, 10, 12, 36, 38, and 40. Consolidation consisted of two cycles of cisplatin and etoposide. Complete responders received prophylactic cranial irradiation. Results were considered promising if the median survival time was at least 21 months and of no further interest if < or = 14 months. S0222 was closed early due to a report of excess toxicity for TPZ in a head and neck cancer trial elsewhere. Of planned 85 patients, 69 were accrued. In 68 assessable patients, 17 (25%) had grade 3 to 4 esophagitis and eight (12%) had grade 3 febrile neutropenia during the concurrent phase. There were three possible treatment-related deaths, two in concurrent phase (one progressive disease not otherwise specified within 30 days, one pericardial effusion) and one in consolidation phase (esophageal hemorrhage).

Post-treatment endoscopic biopsy is a poor-predictor of pathologic response in patients undergoing chemoradiation therapy for esophageal cancer.,Annals of surgery,Ann.

We wanted to determine if endoscopic biopsy can accurately establish evidence of local pathologic complete response (pCR) in patients undergoing CRT. We queried a prospectively maintained database for patients seen at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from 1996 to the present who underwent, (1) CRT for local-regionally advanced esophageal cancer, (2) post-CRT endoscopic biopsy, and (3) esophagectomy. Data points included pathology of post-CRT endoscopy and surgical specimens, tumor histology, and survival. Correlations were analyzed by the chi2 test and one-way analysis of variance. Survival comparisons were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank analysis. One hundred fifty-six patients were identified. Over 80% of patients received cisplatin-based chemotherapy and 5040 cGy of radiation. One hundred eighteen patients had no tumor identified on endoscopic biopsy. A negative biopsy at endoscopy was a poor predictor of pCR (negative predictive value: 31%), with 69% having local disease at esophagectomy. A positive biopsy was predictive of residual disease (positive predictive value: 95%). Negative endoscopic biopsy better predicted a pCR for squamous cell carcinomas versus adenocarcinomas (P[r] < 0.001). Nodal status of surgical specimens was not correlated with post-treatment endoscopic findings.

Constitutive short telomere length of chromosome 17p and 12q but not 11q and 2p is associated with an increased risk for esophageal cancer.,"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",Cancer Prev Res (Phila),2009-04-28,"Shortened telomere length may cause chromosomal instability in Barrett's esophagus and thus promote tumorigenesis. However, whether short telomere length in all chromosomes or just some of them is associated with increased esophageal cancer (EC) risk is largely unknown. To address this question, we examined the overall and chromosome-specific telomere lengths of 17p, 12q, 2p, and 11q and assessed their associations with EC risk. In a case-control study with 94 EC cases and 94 matched controls, the overall telomere length and the chromosome-specific telomere lengths of 17p, 12q, 2p, and 11q in peripheral blood lymphocytes were determined by a real-time PCR and a modified single telomere length analysis assay, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between telomere length and EC risk.

An overview on the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 in tumors of the head and neck.,Oral oncology,Oral Oncol.,2009-05-19,"Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) levels are increased in various tumors, particularly those involving the esophagus, stomach, breast, pancreas, lung, colon, skin, urinary bladder, prostate and head and neck. Nevertheless, the tumorigenic mechanisms of COX-2 overexpression still remain poorly understood and may include mechanisms that may act at different stages of the disease. Thus, the literature shows increasing evidence that overexpression of the COX-2 plays an important role in tumor growth and spread of tumors by interfering with different biological processes such as cell proliferation, cellular adhesion, immune surveillance, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Furthermore, the expression of COX-2 might shed some light over the physiopathology and clinical behavior of tumors of the head and neck, including benign odontogenic neoplasms of the jaws with an aggressive behavior, such as keratocystic odontogenic tumors (KCOT).

Data recorded included demographics, PET SUVmax, treatment details, pathologic details, and survival data. Comparison of categorical variables was done by chi analysis, continuous variables by t test, survival analysis by the Kaplan-Meier method, and comparisons of survival using the log-rank test. Between January 1996 and September 2007, 189 patients were appropriate for this analysis. The initial PET SUVmax was <4.5 in 28 patients and >or=4.5 in 161 patients. The two groups were similar with regards to demographics and treatment details. Patients in the low SUV group were less likely to show evidence of treatment response after chemoradiotherapy, including a higher likelihood of residual nodal disease and a lower likelihood of a pathologic complete response and estimated treatment response. However, both groups had similar survival. Although the initial PET SUVmax does not predict survival in patients with locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma who receive preoperative chemoradiotherapy, patients with a high initial SUVmax respond better to preoperative therapy. These results can be used to better select esophageal cancer patients for combined modality treatment.",Journal Article,3856.0,62.0,We have previously shown that in early clinical stage adenocarcinoma a positron emission tomography standardized uptake values PET SUVmax of 4.5 is associated with earlier pathologic stage and predicts better survival In this study we analyze the impact of the pretreatment PET SUVmax in patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma who undergo preoperative chemoradiotherapy We performed a retrospective analysis selecting patients with adenocarcinoma of the who had a pretreatment PET scan and who received chemoradiotherapy before esophagectomy Data recorded included demographics PET SUVmax treatment details pathologic details and survival data Comparison of categorical variables was done by chi analysis continuous variables by t test survival analysis by the Kaplan-Meier method and comparisons of survival using the log-rank test Between January 1996 and September 2007 189 patients were appropriate for this analysis The initial PET SUVmax was 4.5 in 28 patients and or=4.5 in 161 patients The two groups were similar with regards to demographics and treatment details Patients in the low SUV group were less likely to show evidence of treatment response after chemoradiotherapy including a higher likelihood of residual nodal disease and a lower likelihood of a pathologic complete response and estimated treatment response However both groups had similar survival Although the initial PET SUVmax does not predict survival in patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma who receive preoperative chemoradiotherapy patients with a high initial SUVmax respond better to preoperative therapy These results can be used to better select cancer patients for combined modality treatment,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[21, 47, 373, 443, 17, 4, 191, 38, 82, 449, 8, 1900, 1799, 872, 1670, 1135, 1030, 495, 4996, 1, 39, 33, 16, 41, 5, 1677, 510, 82, 2, 2623, 380, 25, 4, 26, 45, 21, 1992, 3, 345, 1, 3, 1194, 495, 4996, 4, 7, 5, 795, 131, 449, 54, 1251, 498, 1464, 21, 173, 8, 459, 65, 3675, 7, 5, 449, 1, 3, 54, 42, 8, 1194, 495, 1657, 2, 54, 103, 1464, 348, 3617, 74, 1872, 159, 2221, 495, 4996, 24, 3791, 510, 3791, 2, 25, 74, 1155, 1, 5982, 682, 10, 1822, 20, 3163, 65, 1314, 682, 20, 102, 412, 25, 65, 20, 3, 876, 882, 596, 2, 2213, 1, 25, 75, 3, 1066, 1026, 412, 59, 1024, 2648, 2, 2636, 1307, 5899, 7, 11, 870, 9, 26, 65, 3, 388, 495, 4996, 10, 39, 33, 4, 339, 7, 2, 15, 39, 33, 4, 5377, 7, 3, 100, 271, 11, 288, 5, 8930, 6, 2221, 2, 24, 3791, 7, 4, 3, 154, 2217, 87, 11, 299, 322, 6, 514, 241, 1, 24, 51, 50, 1464, 141, 8, 142, 1420, 1, 753, 779, 34, 2, 8, 280, 1420, 1, 8, 510, 236, 51, 2, 661, 24, 51, 137, 110, 271, 42, 288, 25, 242, 3, 388, 495, 4996, 1097, 44, 678, 25, 4, 7, 5, 795, 131, 449, 54, 560, 498, 1464, 7, 5, 8, 64, 388, 4996, 1892, 380, 6, 498, 36, 46, 99, 122, 40, 95, 6, 380, 1717, 12, 7, 9, 397, 1396, 24]",1692.0,19487968,55

Recent studies have demonstrated that pre- or perioperative chemotherapy is associated with improved survival. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy continues to be investigated but is associated with several advantages over neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone. Primary chemoradiotherapy is the accepted standard of care for medically inoperable patients, whereas adjuvant chemoradiotherapy may be considered for patients who undergo primary resection of lower esophageal/gastroesophageal junction tumors.

Preemptive surgery for premalignant foregut lesions.,Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,J. Gastrointest. Surg.,2009-06-10,"Preemptive surgery is the prophylactic removal of an organ at high risk for malignant transformation or the resection of a precancerous or ""early"" malignant neoplasm in an individual with a hereditary predisposition to cancer. Recent advances in molecular diagnostic techniques have improved our understanding of the biologic behavior of these conditions. Predictive testing is an emerging field that attempts to assess the potential risk of cancer development in predisposed individuals. Despite substantial improvement in these forms of testing, all results are imperfect. This information often becomes an important tool that is used by healthcare providers to evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of various risk modifying strategies (i.e., intensive surveillance or preemptive surgery). A systematic literature review was performed using Medline and the bibliographies of all referenced publications to identify articles relating to preemptive surgery for premalignant foregut lesions. In this review, we outline the controversies surrounding predictive risk assessment, surveillance strategies, and preemptive surgery in the management of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) in Barrett's esophagus (BE), hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC), bile duct cysts, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and pancreatic cystic neoplasms. Resection of BE is supported by the progressive nature of the disease, the risk of occult carcinoma, and the lethality of esophageal cancer. Prophylactic total gastrectomy for HDGC appears reasonable in the absence of accurate screening tests but must be balanced by the impact of surgical complications and altered quality of life. Surgical resection of biliary cysts theoretically eliminates the exposed epithelium to decrease the lifetime risk of cholangiocarcinoma. Liver transplantation for PSC remains controversial given the scarcity of donor organs and inability to accurately identify high-risk individuals. Given the uncertain natural history of pancreatic cystic neoplasms, the merits of selective versus obligatory resection will continue to be debated. Preemptive operations require optimal judgment and surgical precision to maximize function and enhance survival. Ultimately, balancing the risk of surgical intervention with less invasive interventions or observation must be individualized on a case-by-case basis.",Journal Article,3877.0,8.0,Preemptive surgery is the prophylactic removal of an organ at high risk for malignant transformation or the resection of a precancerous or `` early '' malignant neoplasm in an individual with a hereditary predisposition to cancer Recent advances in molecular diagnostic techniques have improved our understanding of the biologic behavior of these conditions Predictive testing is an emerging field that attempts to assess the potential risk of cancer development in predisposed individuals Despite substantial improvement in these forms of testing all results are imperfect This information often becomes an important tool that is used by healthcare providers to evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of various risk modifying strategies i.e. intensive surveillance or preemptive surgery A systematic literature review was performed using Medline and the bibliographies of all referenced publications to identify articles relating to preemptive surgery for premalignant foregut lesions In this review we outline the controversies surrounding predictive risk assessment surveillance strategies and preemptive surgery in the management of high-grade dysplasia HGD in Barrett 's BE hereditary diffuse cancer HDGC duct cysts primary sclerosing cholangitis PSC and cystic neoplasms Resection of BE is supported by the progressive nature of the disease the risk of occult carcinoma and the lethality of cancer Prophylactic total gastrectomy for HDGC appears reasonable in the absence of accurate screening tests but must be balanced by the impact of surgical complications and altered quality of life Surgical resection of biliary cysts theoretically eliminates the exposed epithelium to decrease the lifetime risk of cholangiocarcinoma transplantation for PSC remains controversial given the scarcity of donor organs and inability to accurately identify high-risk individuals Given the uncertain natural history of cystic neoplasms the merits of selective versus obligatory resection will continue to be debated Preemptive operations require optimal judgment and surgical precision to maximize function and enhance survival Ultimately balancing the risk of surgical intervention with less invasive interventions or observation must be individualized on a case-by-case basis,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[15332, 152, 16, 3, 1862, 2829, 1, 35, 1259, 28, 64, 43, 9, 393, 1392, 15, 3, 170, 1, 8, 6605, 15, 191, 522, 393, 2131, 4, 35, 797, 5, 8, 2305, 2863, 6, 12, 435, 954, 4, 219, 752, 1092, 47, 231, 114, 612, 1, 3, 1283, 1710, 1, 46, 1298, 464, 471, 16, 35, 1478, 1067, 17, 4374, 6, 423, 3, 174, 43, 1, 12, 193, 4, 11072, 869, 550, 1281, 767, 4, 46, 2377, 1, 471, 62, 99, 32, 13613, 26, 487, 629, 5366, 35, 305, 1515, 17, 16, 95, 20, 2819, 1994, 6, 376, 3, 43, 247, 197, 1, 747, 43, 4898, 422, 70, 563, 1686, 617, 15, 15332, 152, 8, 1556, 789, 206, 10, 173, 75, 3388, 2, 3, 21080, 1, 62, 13365, 4463, 6, 255, 2384, 7750, 6, 15332, 152, 9, 4343, 20481, 406, 4, 26, 206, 21, 5277, 3, 6613, 2976, 464, 43, 455, 617, 422, 2, 15332, 152, 4, 3, 284, 1, 64, 88, 2253, 6623, 4, 4366, 292, 40, 2305, 1388, 12, 21972, 2920, 4395, 86, 6782, 8541, 5417, 2, 2965, 1179, 170, 1, 40, 16, 2708, 20, 3, 1014, 2202, 1, 3, 34, 3, 43, 1, 2879, 134, 2, 3, 3266, 1, 12, 1862, 181, 3577, 9, 21972, 1233, 3203, 4, 3, 1127, 1, 1481, 453, 895, 84, 1642, 40, 4115, 20, 3, 345, 1, 221, 521, 2, 1495, 372, 1, 358, 221, 170, 1, 2532, 4395, 9662, 10794, 3, 2234, 2781, 6, 775, 3, 2898, 43, 1, 2126, 497, 9, 5417, 469, 2010, 447, 3, 16074, 1, 1488, 2285, 2, 4985, 6, 2141, 255, 64, 43, 869, 447, 3, 2717, 1504, 532, 1, 2965, 1179, 3, 4986, 1, 1094, 185, 23107, 170, 303, 1906, 6, 40, 7755, 15332, 3867, 1353, 665, 8671, 2, 221, 2720, 6, 4116, 343, 2, 1304, 25, 2050, 13013, 3, 43, 1, 221, 788, 5, 299, 416, 1151, 15, 1664, 1642, 40, 2596, 23, 8, 473, 20, 473, 877]",2262.0,19513795,27
The prognostic importance of pathologically involved celiac node metastases in node-positive patients with carcinoma of the distal esophagus or gastroesophageal junction: a surgical series from the Mayo Clinic.,Diseases of the esophagus : official journal of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus,Dis. Esophagus,2009-06-09,"The management of esophageal cancer with involvement of celiac lymph nodes is controversial. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the clinical importance of metastases to celiac lymph nodes in patients with carcinoma of the distal esophagus or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) who undergo surgical treatment with curative intent. We reviewed the medical records of 310 patients who underwent definitive esophagectomy at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, between 1976 and 1999 for carcinoma of the distal esophagus or GEJ. The disease location was distal esophagus in 163 and GEJ in 147. Fifty-two patients (17%) were found to have celiac node involvement. The survival of these patients was compared with that of 97 N0 patients and 161 N1 patients without celiac node involvement. Squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinomas were found in 24% and 76%, respectively. Ivor Lewis esophagectomy was the most common surgical procedure (76%), followed by transhiatal resection (14%) and modified Ivor Lewis procedure (5%). The median number of nodes resected was 15 (range, 2-45). The median survival of the entire group was 18.8 months. The median survival was 48 months (range, 1.6 months-22 years) for N0 patients and 15.9 months (range, 0.03 months-14.4 years) for N1 patients without celiac node disease (P < 0.001). The median survival was 11.7 months (range, 2.2 months-15.7 years) for celiac node-positive patients, and this difference was statistically significant when compared with survival in N0 patients (P= 0.001) but not when compared with that in N1 patients without celiac node disease (P= 0.57). Survival at 3 and 5 years was 61% and 45% for N0 patients, 21% and 9% for N1 patients without celiac node disease, and 18% and 11% for patients with celiac node disease, respectively. At 10 years, 7% of patients with celiac node involvement in their resected specimen were alive. By multivariate analysis, patients with 4 or more positive lymph nodes had the worst prognosis (risk ratio [RR], 2.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.98-3.48), regardless of their location. We concluded that celiac node metastases were not an adverse prognostic indicator in patients with celiac node involvement compared with N1 patients without celiac node disease. Overall, the number of positive nodes, not their location, correlated best with survival.

"Epidermal growth factor A61G gene polymorphism, gastroesophageal reflux disease and esophageal adenocarcinoma risk.",Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,2009-06-11,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms of key cancer genes, such as EGF A61G, are associated with an elevated risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). As gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is an established risk factor for EAC, we evaluated whether the association between epidermal growth factor (EGF) polymorphism and EAC development is altered by the presence of GERD. EGF genotyping of DNA samples was performed and GERD history was collected for 309 EAC patients and 275 matched healthy controls. Associations between genotypes and EAC risk were evaluated using adjusted logistic regression. Genotype-GERD relationships were explored using analyses stratified by GERD history and joint effects models that considered severity and duration of GERD symptoms. EGF variants (A/G or G/G) were more common (P = 0.02) and GERD was more prevalent (P < 0.001) in cases than in controls. When compared with the EGF wild-type A/A genotype, the G/G variant was associated with a substantial increase in EAC risk among individuals with GERD [Odds ratio 9.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.8-25.0; P < 0.001] and a slight decrease in risk for GERD-free individuals (odds ratio 0.4; 95% CI = 0.22-0.90; P = 0.02). In the joint effects models, the odds of EAC was also highest for G/G patients (when compared with A/A) who either experienced frequent GERD of more than once per week (odds ratio 21.8; 95% CI = 5.1-94.0; P < 0.001) or suffered GERD for longer than 15 years (odds ratio 22.4; 95% CI = 6.5-77.6; P < 0.001).

Association of age and survival in patients with gastroesophageal cancer undergoing surgery with or without preoperative therapy.,Cancer,Cancer,2009-10-01,"Meticulous selection of patients for esophageal cancer surgery is critical, because major surgical intervention can cause considerable consequences. For this study, the authors explored their institution's large surgical experience to examine the impact of age on long-term patient survival and surgical complications. Six hundred consecutive patients with esophageal cancer who underwent surgery (409 patients received preoperative therapy, and 191 patients underwent surgery first) were analyzed. All demographic information (including American Society of Anesthesiology risk scores) and therapy-related information was collected retrospectively. Multiple statistical methods were used to assess survival rates and surgical complications and their correlation with patient age. Twenty-one patients (30-day mortality) first were excluded (n = 600) and then were included (n = 621) in the analysis. By using the median age (</=60 years) as the cutoff point and creating 2 subgroups (ages 61 years to 70 years and aged >70 years) in patients older than the median age, univariate analysis demonstrated a higher risk of death with increasing age (P = .019). In multivariate analysis, increasing age was an independent prognosticator of poor overall survival (P = .041). The inclusion of 30-day mortality did not alter the results. Surgical complications were statistically significantly higher in older patients compared with younger patients in the following categories: aspiration pneumonia, adult respiratory distress syndrome, cardiovascular, neurologic, and miscellaneous complications.

Impact of tumor length on long-term survival of pT1 esophageal adenocarcinoma.,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,J. Thorac. Cardiovasc.

Case histories of all patients (n = 133) undergoing esophageal resection from 1979 to 2007 with pT1 adenocarcinoma of the esophagus were reviewed. Univariate and multivariate analyses of esophageal tumor length and other standard prognostic factors were performed. Patients with early-stage pT1 esophageal adenocarcinoma with tumors less than 3 cm demonstrate decreased long-term survival (3 years: >3 cm = 46% vs 93%; P < .001) and higher risk of lymph node involvement (lymph node positive: >3 cm = 47% vs 10%; P < .001). Multivariable analysis shows that esophageal tumor length (>3 cm) is an independent risk factor for survival in patients with pT1 early-stage esophageal cancer (hazard ratio: 4.8, 95% confidence intervals: 1.4-16.5; P < .001) even when controlled for submucosal involvement, lymph node involvement, and lymphatic/vascular invasion status. In combination with submucosal involvement, esophageal tumor length (>3 cm) identifies a high-risk population of pT1 esophageal adenocarcinoma (3 years: group 1 [0 risk factors] = 100%, group 2 [1 risk factor] = 87%, and group 3 [2 risk factors] = 33%; P < .001). This study demonstrates that esophageal tumor length (>3 cm) is a risk factor for long-term survival and lymph node involvement in early-stage pT1 esophageal adenocarcinoma.

Intensity-modulated proton therapy reduces the dose to normal tissue compared with intensity-modulated radiation therapy or passive scattering proton therapy and enables individualized radical radiotherapy for extensive stage IIIB non-small-cell lung cancer: a virtual clinical study.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol.

Dose volume histograms designed to deliver IMRT at 60 to 63 Gy, PSPT at 74 Gy, and IMPT at the same doses were compared and the use of individualized radical radiotherapy was assessed in patients with extensive stage IIIB NSCLC (n = 10 patients for each approach). These patients were selected based on their extensive disease and were considered to have no or borderline tolerance to IMRT at 60 to 63 Gy, based on the dose to normal tissue volume constraints (lung volume receiving 20 Gy [V20] of <35%, total mean lung dose <20 Gy; spinal cord dose, <45 Gy). The possibility of increasing the total tumor dose with IMPT for each patient without exceeding the dose volume constraints (maximum tolerated dose [MTD]) was also investigated. Compared with IMRT, IMPT spared more lung, heart, spinal cord, and esophagus, even with dose escalation from 63 Gy to 83.5 Gy, with a mean MTD of 74 Gy. Compared with PSPT, IMPT allowed further dose escalation from 74 Gy to a mean MTD of 84.4 Gy (range, 79.4-88.4 Gy) while all parameters of normal tissue sparing were kept at lower or similar levels. In addition, IMPT prevented lower-dose target coverage in patients with complicated tumor anatomies.

Concurrent chemoradiotherapy was begun between 6 and 10 weeks after surgery and consisted of radiotherapy (1.8 Gy/d to a planned dose of 50.4-59.4 Gy), concurrent with two cycles of 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m/d) and cisplatin (20 mg/m/d), both given as 4-day continuous intravenous infusions during the first and fourth weeks of the radiation. Between 1995 and 2006, 50 patients were enrolled. The median age was 59 (range, 33-76) years, and most patients were male (86%), Caucasian (96%), and had undergone a transthoracic esophagogastrectomy (74%) for what proved to be a node positive (86%) adenocarcinoma (86%). Postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy was accompanied by neutropenia requiring hospitalization for fever in only four patients (8%) and no toxic deaths.

The SUVbgd + 20% (SUVmax(slice)--SUVbgd) method optimally estimated gross tumor length, but only reached an unsatisfactory CI for GTV.

Complete Barrett's eradication endoscopic mucosal resection: an effective treatment modality for high-grade dysplasia and intramucosal carcinoma--an American single-center experience.,The American journal of gastroenterology,Am. J. Gastroenterol.,2009-08-18,"Complete Barrett's eradication endoscopic mucosal resection (CBE-EMR) is the endoscopic removal of all Barrett's epithelium with the curative intent of eliminating high-grade dysplasia (HGD)/intramucosal carcinoma (IMC) and reducing the risk of metachronous lesion development. We report our single tertiary referral center's long-term clinical experience using this modality in HGD/IMC management. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed all patients who had CBE-EMR for Barrett's esophagus (BE) with HGD/IMC who had been entered into our center's prospectively collected database. High-definition white-light and narrow-band imaging examinations were used according to the protocol. Staging endoscopic ultrasound was done before CBE-EMR to exclude invasive disease or suspicious lymphadenopathy. High-dose proton pump inhibition was instituted after initial treatment, and Seattle-type surveillance biopsies were performed on follow-up every 6 months once the CBE-EMR procedure was completed. A total of 49 patients (mean age 67 years, median 65, s.d. 11; 75% men) with histologically confirmed BE and HGD (33), IMC (16), underwent CBE-EMR from August 2003 to August 2008. The mean BE segment length was 3.2 cm (median 2, s.d. 2.2); 26 patients had short-segment BE, and 30 had visible lesions. A total of 106 EMR procedures were performed. On initial EMR, two patients had superficial submucosal carcinoma invasion (sm1) and two had IMC with lymphatic channel invasion. All four patients were referred for esophagectomy, but one opted for continued endoscopic management, without evidence of residual or recurrent carcinoma. A total of 14 patients await completion of EMR (9) or first follow-up endoscopy (5). CBE-EMR therapy was completed in 32 patients by an average of 2.1 sessions (median 2, s.d. 0.9). Surveillance biopsies showed normal squamous epithelium in 31 of 32 (96.9%) patients (mean remission time 22.9 months, median 17, s.d. 16.7, interquartile range 11-38). In all, 10 of 46 patients who continued in the endoscopic protocol had subsquamous Barrett's epithelium on EMR specimens and/or treatment endoscopy biopsies. Overall, 1 of these 10 patients had Barrett's underneath squamous mucosa on most recent surveillance biopsies. CBE-EMR upstaged pre-EMR pathology results in 7 of 49 (14%) of patients and downstaged pathology in 15 of 49 (31%) patients. In all, 18 of 49 (37%) patients developed symptomatic esophageal stenosis after a mean of 24.4 days (median 13.5, s.d. 27.8); all were successfully managed by endoscopic treatment. No perforations or uncontrollable bleeding occurred. To our knowledge, this is the largest American single-center experience demonstrating that CBE-EMR with close endoscopic surveillance is an effective treatment modality for BE with HGD/IMC. Although the rate of stenosis development is significant, it is easily treated by endoscopic dilation. Patients considering endoscopic ablation should be counseled appropriately. The role of CBE-EMR in patients with lymphatic invasion or superficial submucosal invasion remains to be defined.",Comparative Study,3808.0,198.0,Complete Barrett 's eradication endoscopic mucosal

Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration for staging of malignant pleural mesothelioma.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2009-09-01,"Radical surgery for malignant pleural mesothelioma does not improve survival in patients with nodal metastases. Imaging is poor at predicting nodal involvement and mediastinoscopy, though frequently used, is of low sensitivity. As endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and esophageal endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are accurate for nodal staging of lung cancer, we hypothesized that they would be at least as sensitive as cervical video-mediastinoscopy for nodal staging of mesothelioma. Eighty-five patients with mesothelioma who were potential candidates for radical surgery underwent preoperative staging with mediastinoscopy (n = 50) or EBUS (n = 38). Eleven patients also underwent EUS. Diagnostic yield (specimens containing lymphocytes or tumor cells) was 100% for mediastinoscopy and 84% for EBUS (p < 0.001). Mediastinoscopy identified 7 of 50 (14%) patients with nodal metastases. Thirty-eight (76%) mediastinoscopy-negative patients underwent surgery with nodal sampling and there were 18 false negatives. Endobronchial ultrasound identified 13 of 38 (34%) patients with nodal metastases. Twenty-two (58%) EBUS-negative patients underwent surgery with nodal sampling and there were 10 false negatives. Sensitivity and negative predictive value for mediastinoscopy were 28% and 49%, and 59% and 57% for EBUS. Eleven patients had EUS preoperatively, which revealed infradiaphragmatic nodal metastases in 5 patients.

Centralization of cancer surgery: implications for patient access to optimal care.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-08-31,"The volume-outcomes relationship has led many to advocate centralization of cancer procedures at high volume hospitals (HVH). We hypothesized that in response cancer surgery has become increasingly centralized and that this centralization has resulted in increased travel burden for patients. Using 1996 to 2006 discharge data from NY, NJ, PA, all patients > or = 18 years old treated with extirpative surgery for colorectal, esophageal, or pancreatic cancer were examined. Patients and hospitals were geocoded. Annual hospital procedure volume for each tumor site was examined, and multiple quantile and logistic regressions were used to compare changes in centralization and distance traveled. Five thousand two hundred seventy-three esophageal, 13,472 pancreatic, 202,879 colon, and 51,262 rectal procedures were included. A shift to HVH occurred to varying degrees for all tumor types. The odds of surgery at a low volume hospital decreased for esophagus, pancreas and colon: per year odds ratios (ORs) were 0.87 (95% CI, 0.85 to 0.90), 0.85 (95% CI, 0.84 to 0.87), and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.97 to 0.98). Median travel distance increased for all sites: esophagus 72%, pancreas 40%, colon 17%, and rectum 28% (P < .0001). Travel distance was proportional to procedure volume (P < .0001). The majority of the increase in distance was attributable to centralization. There has been extensive centralization of complex cancer surgery over the past decade. While this process should result in population-level improvements in cancer outcomes, centralization is increasing patient travel. For some subsets of the population, increasing travel requirements may pose a significant barrier to access to quality cancer care.",Journal Article,3795.0,200.0,"The volume-outcomes relationship has led many to advocate centralization of cancer procedures at high volume hospitals HVH We hypothesized that in response cancer surgery has become increasingly centralized and that this centralization has resulted in increased travel burden for patients Using 1996 to 2006 discharge data from NY NJ PA all patients or 18 years old treated with extirpative surgery for or cancer were examined Patients and hospitals were geocoded Annual hospital procedure volume for each tumor site was examined and multiple quantile and logistic regressions were used to compare changes in centralization and distance traveled Five thousand two hundred seventy-three 13,472 202,879 and 51,262 procedures were included A shift to HVH occurred to varying degrees for all tumor types The odds of surgery at a low volume hospital decreased for and per year odds ratios ORs were 0.87 95 CI 0.85 to 0.90 0.85 95 CI 0.84 to 0.87 and 0.97 95 CI 0.97 to 0.98 Median travel distance increased for all sites 72 40 17 and rectum 28 P .0001 Travel distance was proportional to procedure volume P .0001 The majority of the increase in distance was attributable to centralization There has been extensive centralization of complex cancer surgery over the past decade While this process should result in population-level improvements in cancer outcomes centralization is increasing patient travel For some subsets of the population increasing travel requirements may pose a significant barrier to access to quality cancer care",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,"[3, 433, 123, 858, 71, 836, 445, 6, 8912, 21577, 1, 12, 1369, 28, 64, 433, 1987, 23787, 21, 1237, 17, 4, 51, 12, 152, 71, 1417, 1635, 10826, 2, 17, 26, 21577, 71, 627, 4, 101, 6793, 892, 9, 7, 75, 2648, 6, 1324, 2993, 74, 29, 2906, 12754, 3118, 62, 7, 15, 203, 60, 1095, 73, 5, 13349, 152, 9, 15, 12, 11, 409, 7, 2, 1987, 11, 34003, 2114, 702, 1299, 433, 9, 296, 30, 606, 10, 409, 2, 232, 22476, 2, 812, 5142, 11, 95, 6, 932, 400, 4, 21577, 2, 3019, 12590, 365, 6161, 100, 1128, 2073, 169, 233, 10887, 5918, 15896, 2, 725, 7801, 1369, 11, 159, 8, 3024, 6, 23787, 489, 6, 2990, 4133, 9, 62, 30, 630, 3, 610, 1, 152, 28, 8, 154, 433, 702, 340, 9, 2, 379, 111, 610, 1137, 3694, 11, 13, 912, 48, 58, 13, 772, 6, 13, 424, 13, 772, 48, 58, 13, 874, 6, 13, 912, 2, 13, 1015, 48, 58, 13, 1015, 6, 13, 1096, 52, 6793, 3019, 101, 9, 62, 633, 720, 327, 269, 2, 3660, 339, 19, 488, 6793, 3019, 10, 831, 6, 1299, 433, 19, 488, 3, 686, 1, 3, 344, 4, 3019, 10, 2971, 6, 21577, 125, 71, 85, 1344, 21577, 1, 840, 12, 152, 252, 3, 1219, 2025, 369, 26, 1129, 257, 757, 4, 266, 301, 1474, 4, 12, 123, 21577, 16, 602, 69, 6793, 9, 476, 1890, 1, 3, 266, 602, 6793, 4230, 68, 6015, 8, 93, 3318, 6, 1655, 6, 372, 12, 165]",1529.0,19720926,550

Pathol.,2009-09-04,"The high interobserver variability in grading dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus demands a biomarker that can be applied in routine surgical pathology practice. Immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated histone H3 is a reliable marker of identifying mitotic figures and has not been evaluated in Barrett's esophagus-associated neoplastic lesions. We retrospectively studied the expression of phosphorylated histone H3 in 88 endoscopic biopsy samples of Barrett's esophagus without dysplasia (n=19), indefinite for dysplasia (n=11), low-grade dysplasia (n=27), high-grade dysplasia (n=19), or adenocarcinoma (n=12) from a sample of 54 patients. The samples were included after consensus diagnosis of two gastrointestinal pathologists on the hematoxylin-eosin (HE)-stained sections. Anti-phosphorylated histone H3-labeled mitotic figures were counted per 10 consecutive high-power fields (HPFs) in three distinct regions: surface epithelium, upper 2/3, and lower 1/3 of the crypts. Anti-phosphorylated histone H3-labeled mitotic counts for the three compartments of the crypts and the total scores for Barrett's esophagus, indefinite for dysplasia, low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, and adenocarcinoma were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. For each compartment, the number of anti-phosphorylated histone H3-positive nuclei was higher in low-grade dysplasia than in Barrett's esophagus without dysplasia or indefinite for dysplasia (P<0.001), but no difference was found between Barrett's esophagus without dysplasia and indefinite for dysplasia. High-grade dysplasia biopsies had significantly more anti-phosphorylated histone H3-labeled mitotic figures in the surface epithelium than the low-grade dysplasia (P<0.001). Adenocarcinoma had higher anti-phosphorylated histone H3-labeled mitotic figures than the high-grade dysplasia (P<0.001). Our data support the previous findings of expansion of the proliferative zone and importance of surface mitotic figure in the progression of Barrett's esophagus-low-grade dysplasia-high-grade dysplasia.

MicroRNA expression signatures in Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2009-09-08,"Esophageal adenocarcinoma is a highly aggressive malignancy that frequently develops from Barrett's esophagus, a premalignant pathologic change occurring in the lower end of the esophagus. Identifying Barrett's esophagus patients at high risk of malignant transformation is essential to the prevention of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Although microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures have been associated with the etiology and prognosis of several types of cancers, their roles in the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma have not been extensively evaluated. In this study, we analyzed the expression patterns of 470 human miRNAs using Agilent miRNA microarray in 32 disease/normal-paired tissues from 16 patients diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus of either low- or high-grade dysplasia, or esophageal adenocarcinoma. Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering and class comparison analyses, we found that miRNA expression profiles in tissues of Barrett's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia were significantly different from their corresponding normal tissues. Similar findings were observed for esophageal adenocarcinoma, but not for Barrett's esophagus with low-grade dysplasia. The expression patterns of selected miRNAs were further validated using quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCR in an independent set of 75 pairs of disease/normal tissues.

Gastrointestinal malignancies: when does race matter?,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,J. Am. Coll. Surg.,2009-11-01,"African Americans have a poorer survival from gastrointestinal cancers. We hypothesized that socioeconomic status may explain much of this disparity. Four years of population-based Medicare and Medicaid administrative claims files were merged with the Michigan Tumor Registry. Data were identified for 18,260 patients with colorectal (n = 13,001), pancreatic (n = 2,427), gastric (n = 1,739), and esophageal (n = 1,093) cancer. Three outcomes were studied: the likelihood of late stage diagnosis, the likelihood of surgery after diagnosis, and survival. Bivariate analysis was used to compare stage and operation between African-American and Caucasian patients. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate differences in survival. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. In unadjusted analyses, relative to Caucasian patients, African-American patients with colorectal and esophageal cancer were more likely to present with metastatic disease, were less likely to have surgery, and were less likely to survive during the study period (p < 0.05). In a multivariate analysis, African-American patients had a higher likelihood of death from colorectal cancer than Caucasian patients. This difference, however, did not persist when late stage and surgery were taken into account (hazard ratio = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.24).

A phase I trial of paclitaxel and trastuzumab in combination with interleukin-12 in patients with HER2/neu-expressing malignancies.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2009-11-03,"Our preclinical work showed a dramatic synergy between interleukin-12 (IL-12) and trastuzumab for stimulation of natural killer cell cytokine secretion. We aimed to determine the safety profile of IL-12 when given in combination with trastuzumab and paclitaxel to patients with metastatic HER2-overexpressing cancers. Paclitaxel was given i.v. at 175 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. Trastuzumab was given on day 1 each week (4 mg/kg initially and 2 mg/kg thereafter) in combination with injections of IL-12 on days 2 and 5 starting in cycle 2. This trial accrued 21 patients with metastatic HER2-positive tumors (breast, 7; colon, 6; esophagus, 4; stomach, 2; pancreas, 1; thyroid, 1). The IL-12 component was dose-escalated in cohorts of three patients. The dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3 fatigue at the 300 ng/kg dose level in two patients. The recommended phase II dose was 200 ng/kg administered s.c. There was one complete response in a patient with breast cancer, partial responses in 4 patients (breast, 2; esophageal, 2), and stabilization of disease lasting 3 months or greater (SD) in 6 other patients. All but one response occurred in patients with HER2 3+ disease. Two SD patients completed 1 year of therapy. Ten patients had progressive disease. There was increased activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and increased levels of IFN-gamma and several chemokines in patients with clinical benefit (complete response, partial response, or SD), but not in patients with progressive disease.

Parameters assessed included: ability to obtain intraoperative esophageal patency, complications, number of dilations required, diet, and gastric tube (GT) status. Factors associated with dilation failure were analyzed. Intraoperative esophageal patency was obtained in 91% of patients. Median number of all dilations per patient was three. Median number of CARDs per patient was one. Resumption of oral intake occurred in 36/45 (80%). Diet results included: regular or soft diet 32/45 (71%), GT removal 27/45 (60%), and GT dependence with nothing by mouth 9/45 (20%). Laryngeal and pharyngeal stenosis, radionecrosis, tracheotomy dependence, and elongated stenosis were associated with dilation failure.

This phase II study added gefitinib (G) to our previously tested CCRT regimen in an effort to improve these outcomes. Eligibility required T3, N1, or M1a esophageal or gastroesophageal junction squamous cell or adenocarcinoma staged by esophageal ultrasound and positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Four-day continuous intravenous infusions of cisplatin (20 mg/m/d) and fluorouracil (1000 mg/m/d) began on day 1 of preoperative radiation (30 Gy and 1.5 Gy bid). Surgery followed in 4 to 6 weeks, and an identical course of CCRT 6 to 10 weeks postoperatively. G 250 mg/d was given with preoperative CCRT for 4 weeks and restarted with postoperative therapy for 2 years. Results were retrospectively compared with our historical series of 93 patients given CCRT without G. Between April 2003 and July 2006, 80 patients were enrolled. Patient and tumor characteristics were similar to our historical series. G did not increase toxicity except for development of rash in 42 (53%) and diarrhea in 44 (55%) 3-year Kaplan-Meier estimates (G versus non-G treated patients) included: overall survival (42% versus 28%, p = 0.06), DMC (40% versus 32%, p = 0.33), and locoregional control (76% versus 77%, p = 0.74).

Optimum lymphadenectomy for esophageal cancer.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2010-01-01,"Using Worldwide Esophageal Cancer Collaboration data, we sought to (1) characterize the relationship between survival and extent of lymphadenectomy, and (2) from this, define optimum lymphadenectomy. What constitutes optimum lymphadenectomy to maximize survival is controversial because of variable goals, analytic methodology, and generalizability of the underpinning data. A total of 4627 patients who had esophagectomy alone for esophageal cancer were identified from the Worldwide Esophageal Cancer Collaboration database. Patient-specific risk-adjusted survival was estimated using random survival forests. Risk-adjusted 5-year survival was averaged for each number of lymph nodes resected and its relation to cancer characteristics explored. Optimum number of nodes that should be resected to maximize 5-year survival was determined by random forest multivariable regression. For pN0M0 moderately and poorly differentiated cancers, and all node-positive (pN+) cancers, 5-year survival improved with increasing extent of lymphadenectomy. In pN0M0 cancers, no optimum lymphadenectomy was defined for pTis; optimum lymphadenectomy was 10 to 12 nodes for pT1, 15 to 22 for pT2, and 31 to 42 for pT3/T4, depending on histopathologic cell type. In pN+M0 cancers and 1 to 6 nodes positive, optimum lymphadenectomy was 10 for pT1, 15 for pT2, and 29 to 50 for pT3/T4. Greater extent of lymphadenectomy was associated with increased survival for all patients with esophageal cancer except at the extremes (TisN0M0 and >or=7 regional lymph nodes positive for cancer) and well-differentiated pN0M0 cancer.

Genetic variations in angiogenesis pathway genes predict tumor recurrence in localized adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2010-05-01,"The aim of this study was to determine whether the risk of systemic disease after esophagectomy could be predicted by angiogenesis-related gene polymorphisms. Systemic tumor recurrence after curative resection continues to impose a significant problem in the management of patients with localized esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA). The identification of molecular markers of prognosis will help to better define tumor stage, indicate disease progression, identify novel therapeutic targets, and monitor response to therapy. Proteinase-activated-receptor 1 (PAR-1) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) have been shown to mediate the regulation of local and early-onset angiogenesis, and in turn may impact the process of tumor growth and disease progression. We investigated tissue samples from 239 patients with localized EA treated with surgery alone. DNA was isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded normal esophageal tissue samples and polymorphisms were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and 5'-end [gamma-P] ATP-labeled polymerase chain reaction methods.

Trimodality therapy without a platinum compound for localized carcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-04-01,": The use of platinum-based chemoradiation for esophageal cancer is routine, but it is unclear which class of cytotoxic are optimum. It was hypothesized that chemoradiotherapy with fluoropyrimidine, taxane, and camptothecin would have preserved or improved efficacy with no compromise in safety. : Patients with histologically confirmed, resectable esophageal carcinoma were eligible. In addition to other tests, a baseline endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was obtained. Patients were medically fit and had near-normal organ functions. Patients received docetaxel and irinotecan, plus 5-fluorouracil as induction therapy and then the same cytotoxics with 50.4 grays of radiotherapy followed by an attempted surgery. Pathologic complete response (pathCR) at a rate of > or =20% was the primary endpoint. The pathCR and R0 resection were correlated with overall survival (OS). Safety was documented. : Fifty-five patients were enrolled. Seven were women, and the median age was 56 years. Fifty-three (96%) patients had EUST3, and 41 (75%) had EUSN1 disease. Forty-three (78%) patients underwent surgery, 20% achieved a pathCR, and 76.4% underwent an R0 resection. The median survival (n = 55 patients) was 43.3 months (range, 19-75 months). Baseline clinical parameters were not found to be predictive of OS; however, patients with a pathCR (P = .005) and who underwent R0 resection (P < or = .0001) had an improved OS. There was 1 treatment-related postsurgical death reported.

Vitamin D: considerations in the continued development as an agent for cancer prevention and therapy.,"Cancer journal (Sudbury, Mass.)",Cancer J,,"Considerable preclinical and epidemiologic data suggest that vitamin D may play a role in the pathogenesis, progression, and therapy for cancer. Numerous epidemiologic studies support the hypothesis that individuals with lower serum vitamin D levels have a higher risk of a number of cancers. Measures of vitamin D level in such studies include both surrogate estimates of vitamin D level (residence in more northern latitudes, history of activity, and sun exposure) as well as measured serum 25(OH) cholecalciferol levels. Perhaps, the most robust of these epidemiologic studies is that of Giovannucci et al, who developed and validated an estimate of serum 25(OH) cholecalciferol level and reported that among >40,000 individuals in the Health Professionals Study, an increase in 25(OH) cholecalciferol level of 62.5 ng/mL was associated with a reduction in the risk of head/neck, esophagus, pancreas cancers, and acute leukemia by >50%. Unfortunately, very limited data are available to indicate whether or not giving vitamin D supplements reduces the risk of cancer. Many preclinical studies indicate that exposing cancer cells, as well as vascular endothelial cells derived from tumors, to high concentrations of active metabolites of vitamin D halts progression through cell cycle, induces apoptosis and will slow or stop the growth of tumors in vivo. There are no data that one type of cancer is more or less susceptible to the effects of vitamin D. Vitamin D also potentiates the antitumor activity of a number of types of cytotoxic anticancer agents in in vivo preclinical models. Vitamin D analogues initiate signaling through a number of important pathways, but the pathway(s) essential to the antitumor activities of vitamin D are unclear. Clinical studies of vitamin D as an antitumor agent have been hampered by the lack of a suitable pharmaceutical preparation for clinical study. All commercially available formulations are inadequate because of the necessity to administer large numbers of caplets and the poor ""bioavailability"" of calcitriol (the most carefully studied analogue) at these high doses. Preclinical data suggest that high exposures to calcitriol are necessary for the antitumor effects. Clinical data do indicate that high doses of calcitriol (>100 mcg weekly, intravenously, and 0.15 microg /kg weekly, orally) can be given safely. The maximum tolerated dose of calcitriol is unclear. While a 250-patient trial in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer comparing docetaxel (36 mg/sqm weekly) +/- calcitriol 0.15 microg/kg indicated that calcitriol was very safe may have reduced to death rate, an adequately powered (1000 patients) randomized study of weekly docetaxel + calcitriol versus q3 week docetaxel was negative. The limitations of this trial were the unequal chemotherapy arms compared in this study and the failure to use an optimal biologic dose or maximum-tolerated dose of calcitriol. In view of the substantial preclinical and epidemiologic data supporting the potential role of vitamin D in cancer, careful studies to evaluate the impact of vitamin D replacement on the frequency of cancer and the impact of an appropriate dose and schedule of calcitriol or other active vitamin D analogue on the treatment of established cancer are indicated.",Journal Article,,129.0,"Considerable preclinical and epidemiologic data suggest that vitamin D may play a role in the pathogenesis progression and therapy for cancer Numerous epidemiologic studies support the hypothesis that individuals with lower serum vitamin D levels have a higher risk of a number of cancers Measures of vitamin D level in such studies include both surrogate estimates of vitamin D level residence in more northern latitudes history of activity and sun exposure as well as measured serum 25 OH cholecalciferol levels Perhaps the most robust of these epidemiologic studies is that of Giovannucci et al who developed and validated an estimate of serum 25 OH cholecalciferol level and reported that among 40,000 individuals in the Health Professionals Study an increase in 25 OH cholecalciferol level of 62.5 ng/mL was associated with a reduction in the risk of head/neck cancers and acute by 50 Unfortunately very limited data are available to indicate whether or not giving vitamin D supplements reduces the risk of cancer Many preclinical studies indicate that exposing cancer cells as well as vascular endothelial cells derived from tumors to high concentrations of active metabolites of vitamin D halts progression through cell cycle induces apoptosis and will slow or stop the growth of tumors in vivo There are no data that one type of cancer is more or less susceptible to the effects of vitamin D.

Phys.,2010-03-06,"Conventional therapy for cervical node squamous cell carcinoma metastases from an unknown primary can cause considerable toxicity owing to the volume of tissues to be irradiated. In the present study, hypothesizing that using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) would provide effective treatment with minimal toxicity, we reviewed the outcomes and patterns of failure for head-and-neck unknown primary cancer at a single tertiary cancer center. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 52 patients who had undergone IMRT for an unknown primary at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1998 and 2005. The patient and treatment characteristics were extracted and the survival rates calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Of the 52 patients, 5 presented with Stage N1, 11 with Stage N2a, 23 with Stage N2b, 6 with Stage N2c, 4 with Stage N3, and 3 with Stage Nx disease. A total of 26 patients had undergone neck dissection, 13 before and 13 after IMRT; 14 patients had undergone excisional biopsy and presented for IMRT without evidence of disease. Finally, 14 patients had received systemic chemotherapy. All patients underwent IMRT to targets on both sides of the neck and pharyngeal axis. The median follow-up time for the surviving patients was 3.7 years. The 5-year actuarial rate of primary mucosal tumor control and regional control was 98% and 94%, respectively. Only 3 patients developed distant metastasis with locoregional control. The 5-year actuarial disease-free and overall survival rate was 88% and 89%, respectively.

Co-registered OCM and OCT imaging were performed on fresh surgical specimens and endoscopic biopsy specimens, and images were correlated with histology. Imaging was performed at 1.06-microm wavelength with <2-microm transverse and <4-microm axial resolution for OCM, and at 14-microm transverse and <3-microm axial resolution for OCT. Multiple sites on 75 tissue samples from 39 patients were imaged. OCM enabled cellular imaging of specimens from the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts over a smaller field of view compared to OCT.

In this study, we selected 10 miRNAs and analyzed their expression in 10 esophageal cancer cell lines and 158 tissue specimens using Northern blotting and in situ hybridization, respectively. We found that Let-7g, miR-21 and miR-195p were expressed in all 10 cell lines, miR-9 and miR-20a were not expressed in any of the cell lines, and miR-16-2, miR-30e, miR-34a, miR-126 and miR-200a were expressed in some of the cell lines but not others. In addition, transient transfection of miR-34a inhibited c-Met and cyclin D1 expression and esophageal cancer cell proliferation, whereas miR-16-2 suppressed RAR-β(2) expression and increased tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore, we found that miR-126 expression was associated with tumor cell dedifferentiation and lymph node metastasis, miR-16-2 was associated with lymph node metastasis, and miR-195p was associated with higher pathologic disease stages in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that miR-16-2 expression and miR-30e expression were associated with shorter overall and disease-free survival in all esophageal cancer patients.

Phase II randomized study of two regimens of sequentially administered mitomycin C and irinotecan in patients with unresectable esophageal and gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2010-05-01,"Based on the observation of topoisomerase-1, upregulation by mitomycin C (MMC), and the phase I antitumor activity of sequential MMC/irinotecan in esophageal cancer, we conducted a phase II evaluation of two schedules of this combination in previously untreated stage III/IV esophageal/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas. Patients (n = 76) were randomized to either 6 mg/m MMC on day 1 and 125 mg/m irinotecan on days 2 and 9 (arm A) or 3 mg/m MMC on days 1 and 8 and 125 mg/m irinotecan on days 2 and 9 (arm B). Each cycle was repeated every 28 days. Restaging was planned after two cycles, and resections were performed whenever possible. A two-stage Simon minimax design was used for each arm, with a ""pick-the-winner"" approach based on efficacy. The response rate (complete response + partial response) in 73 evaluable patients was 52% (21 of 40 patients) for arm A and 33% (11/33) for arm B. Moderate or severe toxicity was similar.

Elective nodal irradiation (ENI) vs. involved field radiotherapy (IFRT) for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): A comparative analysis of toxicities and clinical outcomes.,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,Radiother Oncol,2010-03-29,"Elective nodal irradiation (ENI) and involved field radiotherapy (IFRT) are definitive radiotherapeutic approaches used to treat patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ENI delivers prophylactic radiation to clinically uninvolved lymph nodes, while IFRT only targets identifiable gross nodal disease. Because clinically uninvolved nodal stations may harbor microscopic disease, IFRT raises concerns for increased nodal failures. This retrospective cohort analysis evaluates failure rates and treatment-related toxicities in patients treated at a single institution with ENI and IFRT. We assessed all patients with stage III locally advanced or stage IV oligometastatic NSCLC treated with definitive radiotherapy from 2003 to 2008. Each physician consistently treated with either ENI or IFRT, based on their treatment philosophy. Of the 108 consecutive patients assessed (60 ENI vs. 48 IFRT), 10 patients had stage IV disease and 95 patients received chemotherapy. The median follow-up time for survivors was 18.9 months. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, patients treated with IFRT demonstrated a significantly lower risk of high grade esophagitis (Odds ratio: 0.31, p = 0.036). The differences in 2-year local control (39.2% vs. 59.6%), elective nodal control (84.3% vs. 84.3%), distant control (47.7% vs. 52.7%) and overall survival (40.1% vs. 43.7%) rates were not statistically significant between ENI vs. IFRT.

Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: which staging systems best predict prognosis?,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2010-05-10,"The purpose of cancer staging systems is to accurately predict patient prognosis. The outcome of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) depends on both the cancer stage and the extent of liver dysfunction. Many staging systems that include both aspects have been developed. It remains unknown, however, which of these systems is optimal for predicting patient survival. Patients with advanced HCC treated over a 5-year period at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center were identified from an electronic medical record database. Patients with sufficient data for utilization in all staging systems were included. TNM sixth edition, Okuda, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC), Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP), Chinese University Prognostic Index (CUPI), Japan Integrated Staging (JIS), and Groupe d'Etude et de Traitement du Carcinome Hepatocellulaire (GETCH) systems were ranked on the basis of their accuracy at predicting survival by using concordance index (c-index). Other independent prognostic variables were also identified. Overall, 187 eligible patients were identified and were staged by using the seven staging systems. CLIP, CUPI, and GETCH were the three top-ranking staging systems. BCLC and TNM sixth edition lacked any meaningful prognostic discrimination. Performance status, AST, abdominal pain, and esophageal varices improved the discriminatory ability of CLIP. In our selected patient population, CLIP, CUPI, and GETCH were the most informative staging systems in predicting survival in patients with advanced HCC. Prospective validation is required to determine if they can be accurately used to stratify patients in clinical trials and to direct the appropriate need for systemic therapy versus best supportive care.

We used a single institution experience to validate the hypothesis that the WECC system more accurately predicts survival in GEJA patients than both the American Joint Commission on Cancer 6th edition esophageal and gastric systems. We reviewed 449 GEJA patients (Siewert I-III) treated with neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery or surgery-alone between 1990 and 2007. A blinded statistician performed a head-to-head comparison regarding the ability of each staging system to predict survival. A subgroup analysis of patients who underwent surgery only (n = 176) was also performed. All three systems predicted survival of patients with GEJA. However, a Bayesian variable selection model found that the WECC system was better than both American Joint Commission on Cancer esophageal and gastric systems (probability 0.99 and 0.98, respectively). Subset analysis suggested that the WECC staging was also optimum for predicting survival in surgery-alone patients. While the esophageal staging system is better at predicting survival than the gastric staging system, the WECC system may be the most favorable single-system predictor of survival for patients with resected GEJA.

"Two phase I studies of concurrent radiation therapy with continuous-infusion 5-fluorouracil plus epirubicin, and either cisplatin or irinotecan for locally advanced upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas.",Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol.,2010-05-22,"Multimodality therapy with chemotherapy and radiation treatment may improve disease control and overall outcome of locally advanced upper gastrointestinal (UGI) malignancies including esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, and biliary tract carcinomas. However, more effective and less toxic chemotherapy regimens with concomitant radiotherapy are needed beyond concurrent continuous-infusion fluorouracil (CIFU) with radiation that is commonly applied in general practice. Epirubicin, cisplatin, and irinotecan are active cytotoxic chemotherapy agents in UGI cancers. Two parallel phase I studies were designed to test the tolerability (dose-limited toxicity [DLT] and maximum tolerable dose [MTD]) of the combination of radiotherapy concurrently with CIFU, epirubicin, and cisplatin (ECF/radiation) or CIFU, epirubicin, and irinotecan (EIF/radiation) in the treatment of locally advanced upper GI malignancies. CIFU was administered through a portable infusion pump for 5 1/2 weeks during radiation treatment (50.4 Gy-a dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy, with additional comedown of 5.4 Gy). Epirubicin, cisplatin, or irinotecan were administered intravenously each week for 5 weeks (days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29).

Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and risk of esophageal and gastric cancer: Cohort Consortium Vitamin D Pooling Project of Rarer Cancers.,American journal of epidemiology,Am. J. Epidemiol.,2010-06-18,"Upper gastrointestinal (GI) cancers of the stomach and esophagus have high incidence and mortality worldwide, but they are uncommon in Western countries. Little information exists on the association between vitamin D and risk of upper GI cancers. This study examined the association between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and upper GI cancer risk in the Cohort Consortium Vitamin D Pooling Project of Rarer Cancers. Concentrations of 25(OH)D were measured from 1,065 upper GI cancer cases and 1,066 age-, sex-, race-, and season-of blood draw-matched controls from 8 prospective cohort studies. In multivariate-adjusted models, circulating 25(OH)D concentration was not significantly associated with upper GI cancer risk. Subgroup analysis by race showed that among Asians, but not Caucasians, lower concentrations of 25(OH)D (<25 nmol/L) were associated with a statistically significant decreased risk of upper GI cancer (reference: 50-<75 nmol/L) (odds ratio = 0.53, 95% confidence interval: 0.31, 0.91; P trend = 0.003). Never smokers with concentrations of <25 nmol/L showed a lower risk of upper GI cancers (odds ratio = 0.55, 95% confidence interval: 0.31, 0.96).

Cancer of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction: data-driven staging for the seventh edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer/International Union Against Cancer Cancer Staging Manuals.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-08-01,"Previous American Joint Committee on Cancer/International Union Against Cancer (AJCC/UICC) stage groupings for esophageal cancer have not been data driven or harmonized with stomach cancer. At the request of the AJCC, worldwide data from 3 continents were assembled to develop data-driven, harmonized esophageal staging for the seventh edition of the AJCC/UICC cancer staging manuals. All-cause mortality among 4627 patients with esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancer who underwent surgery alone (no preoperative or postoperative adjuvant therapy) was analyzed by using novel random forest methodology to produce stage groups for which survival was monotonically decreasing, distinctive, and homogeneous. For lymph node-negative pN0M0 cancers, risk-adjusted 5-year survival was dominated by pathologic tumor classification (pT) but was modulated by histopathologic cell type, histologic grade, and location. For lymph node-positive, pN+M0 cancers, the number of cancer-positive lymph nodes (a new pN classification) dominated survival. Resulting stage groupings departed from a simple, logical arrangement of TNM. Stage groupings for stage I and II adenocarcinoma were based on pT, pN, and histologic grade; and groupings for squamous cell carcinoma were based on pT, pN, histologic grade, and location. Stage III was similar for histopathologic cell types and was based only on pT and pN. Stage 0 and stage IV, by definition, were categorized as tumor in situ (Tis) (high-grade dysplasia) and pM1, respectively. The prognosis for patients with esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancer depends on the complex interplay of TNM classifications as well as nonanatomic factors, including histopathologic cell type, histologic grade, and cancer location.

Frequent gastrointestinal polyps and colorectal adenocarcinomas in a prospective series of PTEN mutation carriers.,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,2010-06-27,"Germline phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) mutations cause Cowden syndrome (CS), associated with breast and thyroid cancers. Case reports found 35%-85% of CS patients had gastrointestinal (GI) hamartomas. The association of benign and malignant GI neoplasias with CS remains debatable. Our goal is to describe the GI phenotype in a prospective series of PTEN mutation carriers. Patients who met relaxed International Cowden Consortium criteria (N = 2548) or with 5 or more GI polyps, 1 or more of which was hyperplastic or hamartomatous (N = 397), were prospectively recruited.

Cetuximab as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma: a phase II Southwest Oncology Group Study (S0415).,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2010-09-01,"Esophageal adenocarcinomas commonly express the epidermal growth factor receptor. This trial assessed the 6-month overall survival probability in metastatic esophageal cancer patients treated with cetuximab as second-line therapy. This was a multicenter, open-label phase II study of single-agent cetuximab for metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma patients who failed one prior chemotherapy regimen. Adequate organ function and Zubrod performance status of 0 to 2 were required. Patients received cetuximab 400 mg/m intravenously (IV) on week 1 and 250 mg/m IV weekly thereafter. The primary objective was to determine 6-month overall survival. Secondary end points included progression-free survival, response rate, and toxicity. Tumor tissue was collected for correlative studies. Sixty-three patients were registered, with eight ineligible or never treated. Fifty-five eligible patients (49 men, 6 women; median age = 61.2 years [range, 30.7-88.5]) were enrolled. Twenty patients survived more than 6 months for a 6-month overall survival rate of 36% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 24-50%). The median overall survival was 4.0 months (95% CI: 3.2-5.9). Median progression-free survival was 1.8 months (95% CI: 1.7-1.9). One partial response and two unconfirmed partial responses were observed. Two patients experienced grade 4 fatigue. There was one treatment-related death due to pneumonitis. Germline polymorphisms of epidermal growth factor receptor, epidermal growth factor, interleukin (IL)-8, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, vascular epidermal growth factor receptor (VEGF), CCND1, neuropilin 1 (NRP1), and K-ras mutational status were not associated with response or survival. The 6-month overall survival rate of 36% observed on this study failed to meet the primary survival objective. Thus, cetuximab alone cannot be recommended in the second-line treatment of metastatic esophageal cancer.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",3429.0,,adenocarcinomas commonly express the epidermal growth factor receptor This trial assessed the 6-month overall survival probability in metastatic cancer patients treated with cetuximab as second-line therapy This was a multicenter open-label phase II study of single-agent cetuximab for metastatic adenocarcinoma patients who failed one prior chemotherapy regimen Adequate organ function and Zubrod performance status of 0 to 2 were required Patients received cetuximab 400 mg/m intravenously IV on week 1 and 250 mg/m IV weekly thereafter The primary objective was to determine 6-month overall survival Secondary end points included progression-free survival response rate and toxicity Tumor tissue was collected for correlative studies Sixty-three patients were registered with eight ineligible or never treated Fifty-five eligible patients 49 men 6 women median age 61.2 years range 30.7-88.5 were enrolled Twenty patients survived more than 6 months for a 6-month overall survival rate of 36 95 confidence interval CI 24-50 The median overall survival was 4.0 months 95 CI 3.2-5.9 Median progression-free survival was 1.8 months 95 CI 1.7-1.9 One partial response and two unconfirmed partial responses were observed Two patients experienced grade 4 fatigue There was one treatment-related death due to pneumonitis Germline polymorphisms of epidermal growth factor receptor epidermal growth factor interleukin IL -8 cyclooxygenase COX -2 vascular epidermal growth factor receptor VEGF CCND1 neuropilin 1 NRP1 and K-ras mutational status were not associated with response or survival The 6-month overall survival rate of 36 observed on this study failed to meet the primary survival objective Thus cetuximab alone can not be recommended in the second-line treatment of metastatic cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[1586, 841, 1669, 3, 829, 129, 161, 153, 26, 160, 275, 3, 49, 811, 63, 25, 1320, 4, 113, 12, 7, 73, 5, 1175, 22, 419, 328, 36, 26, 10, 8, 1570, 1020, 1756, 124, 215, 45, 1, 226, 420, 1175, 9, 113, 449, 7, 54, 1551, 104, 324, 56, 477, 1658, 1259, 343, 2, 10672, 528, 156, 1, 13, 6, 18, 11, 616, 7, 103, 1175, 1524, 81, 188, 1672, 478, 23, 647, 14, 2, 2039, 81, 188, 478, 709, 3972, 3, 86, 461, 10, 6, 223, 49, 811, 63, 25, 568, 396, 862, 159, 91, 115, 25, 51, 116, 2, 155, 30, 246, 10, 786, 9, 3679, 94, 1746, 169, 7, 11, 1653, 5, 659, 3773, 15, 1737, 73, 1461, 365, 625, 7, 739, 325, 49, 117, 52, 89, 713, 18, 60, 184, 201, 67, 889, 33, 11, 346, 737, 7, 2996, 80, 76, 49, 53, 9, 8, 49, 811, 63, 25, 116, 1, 511, 48, 307, 268, 58, 259, 212, 3, 52, 63, 25, 10, 39, 13, 53, 48, 58, 27, 18, 33, 83, 52, 91, 115, 25, 10, 14, 66, 53, 48, 58, 14, 67, 14, 83, 104, 450, 51, 2, 100, 5971, 450, 253, 11, 164, 100, 7, 592, 88, 39, 613, 125, 10, 104, 24, 139, 273, 520, 6, 2949, 1009, 1203, 1, 829, 129, 161, 153, 829, 129, 161, 1603, 501, 66, 4043, 418, 18, 756, 829, 129, 161, 153, 618, 5737, 15253, 14, 16483, 2, 1634, 1102, 1619, 156, 11, 44, 41, 5, 51, 15, 25, 3, 49, 811, 63, 25, 116, 1, 511, 164, 23, 26, 45, 1551, 6, 3362, 3, 86, 25, 461, 631, 1175, 279, 122, 44, 40, 793, 4, 3, 419, 328, 24, 1, 113, 12]",1787.0,20631636,757
Genome-wide catalogue of chromosomal aberrations in barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma: a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis.,"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",Cancer Prev Res (Phila),2010-07-22,"To better understand the molecular mechanisms behind esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) tumorigenesis, we used high-density single nucleotide polymorphism arrays to profile chromosomal aberrations at each of the four sequential progression stages, Barrett's metaplasia (BM), low-grade dysplasia (LGD), high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and EAC, in 101 patients. We observed a significant trend toward increasing loss of chromosomes with higher progression stage. For BM, LGD, HGD, and EAC, respectively, the average numbers of chromosome arms with loss per sample were 0.30, 3.21, 7.70, and 11.90 (P for trend = 4.82 x 10(-7)), and the mean percentages of single nucleotide polymorphisms with allele loss were 0.1%, 1.8%, 6.6%, and 17.2% (P for trend = 2.64 x 10(-6)). In LGD, loss of 3p14.2 (68.4%) and 16q23.1 (47.4%) was limited to narrow regions within the FHIT (3p14.2) and WWOX (16q23.1) genes, whereas loss of 9p21 (68.4%) occurred in larger regions. A significant increase in the loss of other chromosomal regions was seen in HGD and EAC. Loss of 17p (47.6%) was one of the most frequent events in EAC. Many recurrent small regions of chromosomal loss disrupted single genes, including FHIT, WWOX, RUNX1, KIF26B, MGC48628, PDE4D, C20orf133, GMDS, DMD, and PARK2, most of which are common fragile site regions in the human genome. However, RUNX1 at 21q22 seemed to be a potential tumor suppressor gene in EAC. Amplifications were less frequent than losses and mostly occurred in EAC. 8q24 (containing Myc) and 8p23.1 (containing CTSB) were the two most frequently amplified regions. In addition, a significant trend toward increasing amplification was associated with higher progression stage.",Journal Article,3470.0,56.0,To better understand the molecular mechanisms behind adenocarcinoma EAC tumorigenesis we used high-density single nucleotide polymorphism arrays to profile chromosomal aberrations at each of the four sequential progression stages Barrett 's metaplasia BM low-grade dysplasia LGD high-grade dysplasia HGD and EAC in 101 patients We observed a significant trend toward increasing loss of chromosomes with higher progression stage For BM LGD HGD and EAC respectively the average numbers of chromosome arms with loss per sample were 0.30 3.21 7.70 and 11.90 P for trend 4.82 x 10 -7 and the mean percentages of single nucleotide polymorphisms with allele loss were 0.1 1.8 6.6 and 17.2 P for trend 2.64 x 10 -6 In LGD loss of 3p14.2 68.4 and 16q23.1 47.4 was limited to narrow regions within the FHIT 3p14.2 and WWOX 16q23.1 genes whereas loss of 9p21 68.4 occurred in larger regions A significant increase in the loss of other chromosomal regions was seen in HGD and EAC Loss of 17p 47.6 was one of the most frequent events in EAC Many recurrent small regions of chromosomal loss disrupted single genes including FHIT WWOX RUNX1 KIF26B MGC48628 PDE4D C20orf133 GMDS DMD and PARK2 most of which are common fragile site regions in the human genome However RUNX1 at 21q22 seemed to be a potential tumor suppressor gene in EAC Amplifications were less frequent than losses and mostly occurred in EAC 8q24 containing Myc and 8p23.1 containing CTSB were the two most frequently amplified regions In addition a significant trend toward increasing amplification was associated with higher progression stage,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[6, 380, 1640, 3, 219, 483, 5219, 449, 3378, 1565, 21, 95, 64, 1263, 226, 1579, 1907, 3923, 6, 800, 1860, 2152, 28, 296, 1, 3, 294, 1787, 91, 1153, 4366, 292, 6054, 1246, 154, 88, 2253, 14260, 64, 88, 2253, 6623, 2, 3378, 4, 2338, 7, 21, 164, 8, 93, 853, 1317, 602, 407, 1, 3560, 5, 142, 91, 82, 9, 1246, 14260, 6623, 2, 3378, 106, 3, 1011, 1870, 1, 1170, 1335, 5, 407, 379, 1000, 11, 13, 201, 27, 239, 67, 431, 2, 175, 424, 19, 9, 853, 39, 878, 1006, 79, 67, 2, 3, 313, 5504, 1, 226, 1579, 1203, 5, 1254, 407, 11, 13, 14, 14, 66, 49, 49, 2, 269, 18, 19, 9, 853, 18, 660, 1006, 79, 49, 4, 14260, 407, 1, 20184, 18, 806, 39, 2, 26179, 14, 662, 39, 10, 383, 6, 6958, 1374, 262, 3, 8169, 20184, 18, 2, 16786, 26179, 14, 214, 547, 407, 1, 9016, 806, 39, 489, 4, 1077, 1374, 8, 93, 344, 4, 3, 407, 1, 127, 1860, 1374, 10, 527, 4, 6623, 2, 3378, 407, 1, 4135, 662, 49, 10, 104, 1, 3, 96, 908, 281, 4, 3378, 445, 387, 302, 1374, 1, 1860, 407, 5576, 226, 214, 141, 8169, 16786, 6092, 59173, 59174, 59175, 59176, 59177, 26965, 2, 21616, 96, 1, 92, 32, 186, 11752, 606, 1374, 4, 3, 171, 898, 137, 6092, 28, 14402, 5025, 6, 40, 8, 174, 30, 1245, 145, 4, 3378, 4877, 11, 299, 908, 76, 5324, 2, 2754, 489, 4, 3378, 6069, 1101, 1371, 2, 37682, 14, 1101, 19239, 11, 3, 100, 96, 746, 2429, 1374, 4, 352, 8, 93, 853, 1317, 602, 1073, 10, 41, 5, 142, 91, 82]",1595.0,20651033,5
Molecular response prediction in multimodality treatment for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction.,Recent results in cancer research. Fortschritte der Krebsforschung. Progres dans les recherches sur le cancer,Recent Results Cancer Res.,2010-01-01,"Cancers arising from the esophagus are becoming more common in the United States and Europe. In 2009, an estimate of 14,530 new cases will be diagnosed and more than 90% will die of their disease. Esophageal cancer is currently the most rapidly increasing cancer in the western world and is coinciding with a shift in histological type and primary tumor location. Despite recent improvements in the detection, surgical resection, and (radio-) chemotherapy, the overall survival (OS) of esophageal cancer remains relatively poor. It is becoming increasingly apparent that neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery may be beneficial in terms of increasing resectability and OS compared to surgery alone. Results from clinical trials are encouraging; however, they also demonstrated that only patients with major histopathological response (pCR) will benefit from neoadjuvant therapy.

Transhiatal versus transthoracic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.,World journal of gastroenterology,World J. Gastroenterol.,2010-08-01,"Esophageal cancer continues to represent a formidable challenge for both patients and clinicians. Relative 5-year survival rates for patients have improved over the past three decades, probably linked to a combination of improved surgical outcomes, progress in systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and the increasing acceptance of multimodality treatment. Surgical treatment remains a fundamental component of the treatment of localized esophageal adenocarcinoma. Multiple approaches have been described for esophagectomy, which can be thematically grouped under two major categories: either transthoracic or transhiatal. The main controversy rests on whether a more extended resection through thoracotomy provides superior oncological outcomes as opposed to resection with relatively limited morbidity and mortality through a transhiatal approach. After numerous trials have addressed these issues, neither approach has consistently proven to be superior to the other one, and both can provide excellent short-term results in the hands of experienced surgeons. Moreover, the available literature suggests that experience of the surgeon and hospital in the surgical management of esophageal cancer is an important factor for operative morbidity and mortality rates, which could supersede the type of approach selected.

Long-term outcome of a phase II study of docetaxel-based multimodality chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced carcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction.,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",Med. Oncol.,2010-08-21,"We performed a phase II trial to evaluate a docetaxel-based regimen in locoregionally advanced esophageal cancer. Untreated stage II-IVa esophageal cancer patients with performance status 0-2 were included. Tumor resectability was determined prior to initiation of study. Induction docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) and cisplatin (75 mg/m(2)) day 1 with prophylactic filgrastim was delivered every 21 days for 3 cycles. Subsequent concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) utilized weekly docetaxel (20 mg/m(2)) and concurrent radiotherapy (2 Gy/day) in resectable/resected patients (50 Gy) and in unresectable patients (66 Gy). A total of 78 patients (15 squamous cell carcinoma, 60 adenocarcinoma, 3 mixed/undifferentiated; 68 men, 10 women; median age 61 years) were accrued. The regimen was administered to 59 (76%) potentially resectable patients and 13 (17%) unresectable patients; 6 patients (8%) received the regimen post-operatively. Response rate in 66 evaluable patients following induction chemotherapy was 30%. Sixty-nine patients underwent CRT. Ten patients had disease progression during CRT. Forty-five out of 59 potentially resectable patients underwent esophagectomy after CRT, and 42 patients had complete tumor resection with negative margins. Eighteen out of 59 patients who were potentially resectable patients had pathologic complete response (pCR-31%). Grade 3/4 toxicity during induction chemotherapy included leucopenia, neutropenia, vomiting, and neuropathy. Esophagitis was the predominant toxicity during CRT. Median overall survival was 11.4 months for unresectable patients, 14.3 months for resectable patients and 10.4 months for patients who received the regimen post-operatively (log-rank P = 0.2492).

Pathologic T0N1 esophageal cancer after neoadjuvant therapy and surgery: an orphan status.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2010-09-01,"Patients with esophageal carcinoma who appear to have a complete response at the primary tumor site after undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy may still have residual disease in regional lymph nodes despite clinically negative restaging (ypT0N1). We hypothesized that these patients would have similar survival to patients with incomplete response to therapy. We reviewed 336 esophageal cancer patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by complete resection. We identified 20 patients who obtained complete pathologic response at the primary tumor with persistent metastatic disease to regional lymph nodes (ypT0N1). These patients were compared to 123 patients with pathologic complete response and 193 with partial response for overall survival. Demographics among the three groups of patients were similar except that this cohort of patients with ypT0N1 had higher initial clinical stage (p = 0.013) and had more squamous cell carcinoma pathology (p = 0.005). Eighty-six percent of the ypT0N1 patients who had modern preoperative staging were felt to have clinical complete response. Five-year survival of ypT0N1 patients was intermediate, similar to pathologic partial response stage II patients in both the sixth and seventh editions of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging criteria.

Improved long-term outcome with chemoradiotherapy strategies in esophageal cancer.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2010-09-01,"Controversy currently exists about the optimum preoperative treatment platform for locoregionally advanced esophageal cancer, namely, preoperative chemoradiotherapy (preoperative C/RT) or preoperative chemotherapy alone. We therefore reviewed sequential phase II/III trials performed at a single institution to assess the impact of preoperative chemotherapy versus preoperative C/RT strategies. In all, 157 esophageal cancer patients were sequentially enrolled in phase II/III trials at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center from March 27, 1990, to March 8, 2005. The treatment approaches included preoperative chemotherapy, n = 76 (INT 113 and ID90-01); preoperative C/RT, n = 81 (ID96-189 and DM98-349). Analysis was by intention to treat. Factors evaluated included demographics, preoperative staging, type of surgery, pathology, adjuvant therapies, and long-term outcome. Adenocarcinoma predominated (85%), with cT3 (73%) and cN1 (43%). No significant difference was noted between groups in demographics or perioperative mortality. More patients with preoperative C/RT were staged with endoscopic ultrasound (52% versus 9%, p < 0.001).

Endoscopic esophageal tumor length: a prognostic factor for patients with esophageal cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-08-27,"Pathologic esophageal tumor length (pL) is an independent predictor of long-term survival. However, whether patients with longer (high-risk) tumors can be identified by endoscopy before surgery has not been established. The objective of the current study was to determine the value of endoscopically measured tumor length (cL) in predicting overall survival in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma. All patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma who had undergone resection without neoadjuvant therapy and who had documented preoperative endoscopy findings were identified retrospectively by using prospectively collected databases at 2 institutions: The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (n = 164; training set) and University of Rochester Medical Center (n = 109; validation set). Esophageal tumors were assessed preoperatively by endoscopy for cL, depth (cT), and lymph node involvement (cN). Univariate and multivariate analyses of cL and other standard prognostic factors were performed. In the training set, cL was correlated directly with pL (Pearson correlation [r] = 0.683; P < .001). Regression tree analyses suggested an optimum cutoff point of cL >2 cm to identify patients with decreased long-term survival (5-year survival rate: cL >2 cm, 29%; cL ≤ 2 cm, 78%; P < .001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that cL >2 cm was an independent risk factor for long-term survival (hazard ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-4.4; P = .02) even after controlling for age, cT, and cN. Validation with the validation dataset confirmed that cL was correlated directly with pL (r = 0.657; P < .001) and predicted long-term survival using a cL cutoff point of >2 cm (hazard ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-5.8; P = .004; univariate analysis).

Esophageal cancer: diagnosis and management.,Chinese journal of cancer,Chin J Cancer,2010-10-01,"Esophageal cancer is the 7th leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. While squamous cell carcinoma is the most prevalent histology internationally, adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus accounts for nearly 50% of cases in developed countries due to the differences in the etiologic factors such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and obesity that predominate. While surgery is the mainstay of treatment of this disease, the utilization of chemoradiation, either used postoperatively or neoadjuvantly, has become a standard practice in the United States. What is the optimal management approach is still an area of contention, however, and may be different in different regions around the world.

Outcomes of patients with esophageal cancer staged with [¹⁸F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET): can postchemoradiotherapy FDG-PET predict the utility of resection?,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2010-09-27,"To determine whether [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) can delineate patients with esophageal cancer who may not benefit from esophagectomy after chemoradiotherapy. We reviewed records of 163 patients with histologically confirmed stage I to IVA esophageal cancer receiving chemoradiotherapy with or without resection with curative intent. All patients received surgical evaluation. Initial and postchemoradiotherapy FDG-PET scans and prognostic/treatment variables were analyzed. FDG-PET complete response (PET-CR) after chemoradiotherapy was defined as standardized uptake value ≤ 3. Eighty-eight patients received trimodality therapy and 75 received chemoradiotherapy. Surgery was deferred primarily due to medical inoperability or unresectable/metastatic disease after chemoradiotherapy. A total of 105 patients were evaluable for postchemoradiotherapy FDG-PET response. Thirty-one percent achieved a PET-CR. PET-CR predicted for improved outcomes for chemoradiotherapy (2-year overall survival, 71% v 11%, P < .01; 2-year freedom from local failure [LFF], 75% v 28%, P < .01), but not trimodality therapy. On multivariate analysis of patients treated with chemoradiotherapy, PET-CR is the strongest independent prognostic variable (survival hazard ratio [HR], 9.82, P < .01; LFF HR, 14.13, P < .01). PET-CR predicted for improved outcomes regardless of histology, although patients with adenocarcinoma achieved a PET-CR less often. Patients treated with trimodality therapy found no benefit with PET-CR, likely because FDG-PET residual disease was resected. Definitive chemoradiotherapy patients achieving PET-CR had excellent outcomes equivalent to trimodality therapy despite poorer baseline characteristics. Patients who achieve a PET-CR may not benefit from added resection given their excellent outcomes without resection. These results should be validated in a prospective trial of FDG-PET-directed therapy for esophageal cancer.",Journal Article,3403.0,89.0,To determine whether 18 F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography FDG-PET can delineate patients with cancer who may not benefit from esophagectomy after chemoradiotherapy We reviewed records of 163 patients with histologically confirmed stage I to IVA cancer receiving chemoradiotherapy with or without resection with curative intent All patients received surgical evaluation Initial and postchemoradiotherapy FDG-PET scans and prognostic/treatment variables were analyzed FDG-PET complete response PET-CR after chemoradiotherapy was defined as standardized uptake value ≤ 3 Eighty-eight patients received trimodality therapy and 75 received chemoradiotherapy Surgery was deferred primarily due to medical inoperability or unresectable/metastatic disease after chemoradiotherapy A total of 105 patients were evaluable for postchemoradiotherapy FDG-PET response Thirty-one percent achieved a PET-CR PET-CR predicted for improved outcomes for chemoradiotherapy 2-year overall survival 71 v 11 P .01 2-year freedom from local failure LFF 75 v 28 P .01 but not trimodality therapy On multivariate analysis of patients treated with chemoradiotherapy PET-CR is the strongest independent prognostic variable survival hazard ratio HR 9.82 P .01 LFF HR 14.13 P .01 PET-CR predicted for improved outcomes regardless of histology although patients with adenocarcinoma achieved a PET-CR less often Patients treated with trimodality therapy found no benefit with PET-CR likely because FDG-PET residual disease was resected Definitive chemoradiotherapy patients achieving PET-CR had excellent outcomes equivalent to trimodality therapy despite poorer baseline characteristics Patients who achieve a PET-CR may not benefit from added resection given their excellent outcomes without resection These results should be validated in a prospective trial of FDG-PET-directed therapy for cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[6, 223, 317, 203, 1068, 4085, 1900, 1799, 872, 1285, 495, 122, 5092, 7, 5, 12, 54, 68, 44, 247, 29, 3617, 50, 1464, 21, 446, 1064, 1, 5409, 7, 5, 2161, 557, 82, 70, 6, 5900, 12, 357, 1464, 5, 15, 187, 170, 5, 1075, 1697, 62, 7, 103, 221, 451, 388, 2, 34565, 1285, 495, 1441, 2, 177, 24, 682, 11, 311, 1285, 495, 236, 51, 495, 684, 50, 1464, 10, 395, 22, 1670, 1135, 549, 1552, 27, 2207, 659, 7, 103, 4625, 36, 2, 481, 103, 1464, 152, 10, 9636, 1561, 520, 6, 484, 29066, 15, 1468, 113, 34, 50, 1464, 8, 181, 1, 3263, 7, 11, 859, 9, 34565, 1285, 495, 51, 977, 104, 714, 513, 8, 495, 684, 495, 684, 783, 9, 231, 123, 9, 1464, 18, 111, 63, 25, 792, 603, 175, 19, 355, 18, 111, 3060, 29, 293, 496, 46244, 481, 603, 339, 19, 355, 84, 44, 4625, 36, 23, 331, 65, 1, 7, 73, 5, 1464, 495, 684, 16, 3, 3311, 306, 177, 1347, 25, 360, 197, 168, 83, 878, 19, 355, 46244, 168, 213, 233, 19, 355, 495, 684, 783, 9, 231, 123, 1583, 1, 784, 242, 7, 5, 449, 513, 8, 495, 684, 299, 629, 7, 73, 5, 4625, 36, 204, 77, 247, 5, 495, 684, 322, 408, 1285, 495, 753, 34, 10, 1133, 1057, 1464, 7, 1785, 495, 684, 42, 1503, 123, 2017, 6, 4625, 36, 550, 1769, 330, 374, 7, 54, 1359, 8, 495, 684, 68, 44, 247, 29, 1953, 170, 447, 136, 1503, 123, 187, 170, 46, 99, 257, 40, 938, 4, 8, 482, 160, 1, 1285, 495, 1166, 36, 9, 12]",1882.0,20876421,667
A clinical nomogram predicting pathologic lymph node involvement in esophageal cancer patients.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2010-10-01,"Esophageal cancer patients with pathologic lymph-node involvement (pN1) generally have a poor prognosis with surgery alone. We, therefore, constructed a nomogram to predict the risk of pN1 prior to surgical resection and externally validated the clinical utility of the model. A total of 273 esophageal adenocarcinoma patients treated with surgery alone were reviewed from 2 different institutions (University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center = 164, training set; University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry = 109, validation set). Pretreatment clinical parameters were used to construct a nomogram for predicting the risk of pN1. Internal and external validation of the nomogram was performed to assess clinical utility. Of the 164 patients in the training set, 56 patients (34%) had lymph-node involvement (pN1). Significant factors associated with pN1 on univariable logistic regression analysis (using a P < 0.05) included endoscopically determined clinical tumor depth (cT), clinical nodal (cN) status, and clinical tumor length (cL). Multivariable analysis suggested the significant independent factors were cT (odds ratio, 5.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-18.6; P < 0.01) and cL >2 cm (odds ratio, 7.0; 95% confidence interval, 2.7-18.1; P < 0.001). Regression tree analysis was used to determine the best cutoff for cL. A nomogram was created for pN1 using these clinical parameters and was internally validated by bootstrapping with a predicted accuracy of 85.1%. External validation performed on the validation set demonstrated an original C-index of 0.777 suggesting good clinical utility.

Our cohort represented 22 041 person-years at risk. Sixty-six solid cancers were reported at a median of 6 years after HCT. The cumulative-incidence of solid cancers at 5 and 10 years after HCT was 0.6% and 1.2% among acute myeloid leukemia and 0.9% and 2.4% among chronic myeloid leukemia patients. In comparison to general population incidence rates, HCT recipients had 1.4× higher than expected rate of invasive solid cancers (95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.79, P = .01). Significantly elevated risks were observed for tumors of the oral cavity, esophagus, lung, soft tissue, and brain.

This study analyzed the largest series of consecutive cT2N0M0 esophageal cancer patients treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Data from all patients with cT2N0M0 (assessment included endoscopic ultrasonography and computed tomography of the chest and abdomen) thoracic esophageal cancer who were treated with preoperative chemoradiation between 1997 and 2009 were analyzed. The Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier plots were used to analyze the data. Data from 49 patients were analyzed. The median follow-up was 28.46 months. Male sex and adenocarcinoma histology predominated. Pathologic complete response was observed 19 (39%) patients. The 10-year actuarial overall survival (OS) for adenocarcinoma patients was >60%. In the univariate analysis for OS, squamous histology (P = .006), smoking (P = .015), and alcohol consumption (P = .032) were found to be associated with poor OS. In the univariate analysis for disease-free survival (DFS), squamous histology (P = .009) and smoking (P = .014) were associated with poor DFS. In the multivariate analysis for OS, smoking was an independent prognosticator (P = .02). In the multivariate analysis for DFS, advanced pathologic stage (P = .05) and lymph node metastases (P = .006) were independent prognosticators. Patients with adenocarcinoma (P = .002) and those with pathologic N0 disease had better OS and DFS. Upward stage migration occurred in only 10% of patients. These data suggest that smoking and alcohol influence the long-term outcome of patients with cT2N0M0 disease.

This phase II study tested 500 mg/m neoadjuvant pemetrexed intravenously and carboplatin with an area under the curve of 6 intravenously on days 1 and 22 in conjunction with concomitant radiation of 5040 centigray, which was given in 28 daily fractions of 180 centigray. The primary endpoint was the rate of pathologic complete response. This trial closed early because, during an interim analysis, the primary endpoint fell short. However, 26 eligible patients were accrued. Twenty (74%) were men. Performance scores of 0, 1, and 2 were seen in 16 (59%), 9 (33%), and 2 (7%), respectively. Among eligible patients, 6 of 26 (23%; 95% confidence interval 9-44%) demonstrated a pathologic complete response. Twenty-two underwent a complete cancer resection. The median survival was 17.8 months (95% confidence interval: 12.2-30.7 months).

Apparatus-dependent dosimetric differences in spine stereotactic body radiotherapy.,Technology in cancer research & treatment,Technol. Cancer Res. Treat.,2010-12-01,"The purpose of this investigation was to study apparatus-dependent dose distribution differences specific to spine stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) treatment planning. This multi-institutional study was performed evaluating an image-guided robotic radiosurgery system (CK), intensity modulated protons (IMP), multileaf collimator (MLC) fixed-field IMRT with 5 mm (11 field), 4 mm (9 field), and 2.5 mm (8- and 9-field) leaf widths and intensity modulated volumetric arc therapy (IMVAT) with a 2.5 mm MLC. Treatment plans were systematically developed for targets consisting of one, two and three consecutive thoracic vertebral bodies (VBs) with the esophagus and spinal cord contoured as the organs at risk. It was found that all modalities achieved acceptable treatment planning constraints. However, following normalization fixed field IMRT with a 2.5 mm MLC, IMVAT and IMP systems yielded the smallest ratio of maximum dose divided by the prescription dose (MD/PD) for one-, two- and three-VB PTVs (ranging from 1.1-1.16). The 2.5 mm MLC 9-field IMRT, IMVAT and CK plans resulted in the least dose to 0.1 cc volumes of spinal cord and esophagus. CK plans had the greatest degree of target dose inhomogeneity. As the level of complexity increased with an increasing number of vertebral bodies, distinct apparatus features such as the use of a high number of beams and a finer leaf size MLC were favored.

Esophageal cancer dose escalation using a simultaneous integrated boost technique.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2010-12-01,"We previously showed that 75% of radiation therapy (RT) failures in patients with unresectable esophageal cancer are in the gross tumor volume (GTV). We performed a planning study to evaluate if a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) technique could selectively deliver a boost dose of radiation to the GTV in patients with esophageal cancer. Treatment plans were generated using four different approaches (two-dimensional conformal radiotherapy [2D-CRT] to 50.4 Gy, 2D-CRT to 64.8 Gy, intensity-modulated RT [IMRT] to 50.4 Gy, and SIB-IMRT to 64.8 Gy) and optimized for 10 patients with distal esophageal cancer. All plans were constructed to deliver the target dose in 28 fractions using heterogeneity corrections. Isodose distributions were evaluated for target coverage and normal tissue exposure. The 50.4 Gy IMRT plan was associated with significant reductions in mean cardiac, pulmonary, and hepatic doses relative to the 50.4 Gy 2D-CRT plan. The 64.8 Gy SIB-IMRT plan produced a 28% increase in GTV dose and comparable normal tissue doses as the 50.4 Gy IMRT plan; compared with the 50.4 Gy 2D-CRT plan, the 64.8 Gy SIB-IMRT produced significant dose reductions to all critical structures (heart, lung, liver, and spinal cord). The use of SIB-IMRT allowed us to selectively increase the dose to the GTV, the area at highest risk of failure, while simultaneously reducing the dose to the normal heart, lung, and liver.

We reviewed individual patient medical records and abstracted demographic, pathologic, perioperative, and cancer outcome data. Median follow-up for vital status and disease recurrence was 12.8 and 5.8 years, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed the following factors to be statistically associated with worse 5-year disease-specific survival: higher N and T status, higher tumor grade, age older than 76 years, and the presence of extracapsular lymph node extension and signet ring cells. The following factors remained significantly linked with worse 5-year disease-specific survival on multivariate analysis: higher N and T status, grade, and age and the absence of preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Anatomic location of tumor was not associated with differential prognosis. Lymph node metastases were found in 25 (27%) of 93 T1b tumors, 397 (85%) of 468 T3 tumors, and 22 (67%) of 33 T4a tumors.

The influence of high body mass index on the prognosis of patients with esophageal cancer after surgery as primary therapy.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-11-08,"High body mass index (BMI), a prevalent condition in the United States, is associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Its influence on a patient's outcome remains unclear. In the current study, the authors examined the impact of BMI on survival and complications in patients with esophageal cancer (EC) who underwent surgery as their primary therapy. The authors retrospectively reviewed 301 consecutive EC patients who underwent surgery but received no adjunctive therapy. Patients were segregated into 2 subgroups based on their baseline BMI: normal/low (<25 kg/m(2) ) and high (≥25 kg/m(2) ). Seventy-six (25%) patients had a BMI <25 kg/m(2) and 225 (75%) patients had a BMI ≥25 kg/m(2) . In the high BMI group, there were more men (P < .001), fewer upper ECs (P = .021), a lower baseline clinical stage (P = .006), and frequent EAC (P < .001). Postoperative morbidity was similar in both groups, with the exception of gastrointestinal complications (P = .016). The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 44% in the normal/low BMI group and 60% in the high BMI group (P = .017). The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 41% in the normal/low BMI group and 60% in the high BMI group (P = .005).

Prognostic biomarkers for esophageal adenocarcinoma identified by analysis of tumor transcriptome.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2010-11-30,"Despite many attempts to establish pre-treatment prognostic markers to understand the clinical biology of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), validated clinical biomarkers or parameters remain elusive. We generated and analyzed tumor transcriptome to develop a practical biomarker prognostic signature in EAC. Untreated esophageal endoscopic biopsy specimens were obtained from 64 patients undergoing surgery and chemoradiation. Using DNA microarray technology, genome-wide gene expression profiling was performed on 75 untreated cancer specimens from 64 EAC patients. By applying various statistical and informatical methods to gene expression data, we discovered distinct subgroups of EAC with differences in overall gene expression patterns and identified potential biomarkers significantly associated with prognosis. The candidate marker genes were further explored in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from an independent cohort (52 patients) using quantitative RT-PCR to measure gene expression. We identified two genes whose expression was associated with overall survival in 52 EAC patients and the combined 2-gene expression signature was independently associated with poor outcome (P<0.024) in the multivariate Cox hazard regression analysis. Our findings suggest that the molecular gene expression signatures are associated with prognosis of EAC patients and can be assessed prior to any therapy.

Efficacy and toxicity of chemoradiotherapy using intensity-modulated radiotherapy for unknown primary of head and neck.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2010-12-20,"No single standard treatment paradigm is available for head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma of an unknown primary (HNCUP). Bilateral neck radiotherapy with mucosal axis irradiation is widely used, with or without chemotherapy and/or surgical resection. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is a highly conformal method for delivering radiation that is becoming the standard of care and might reduce the long-term treatment-related sequelae. We report the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute experience with IMRT-based treatment for HNCUP. A retrospective study of all patients treated at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute for HNCUP with IMRT between August 2004 and January 2009. The primary endpoint was overall survival; the secondary endpoints were locoregional and distant control, and acute and chronic toxicity. A total of 24 patients with HNCUP were included. Of these patients, 22 had Stage N2 disease or greater. All patients underwent neck computed tomography, positron emission tomography-computed tomography, and examination under anesthesia with directed biopsies. Of the 24 patients, 22 received concurrent chemotherapy, and 7 (29%) also underwent induction chemotherapy. The median involved nodal dose was 70 Gy, and the median mucosal dose was 60 Gy. With a median follow-up of 2.1 years, the 2-year actuarial overall survival and locoregional control rate was 92% and 100%, respectively.

Second primary cancers after an index head and neck cancer: subsite-specific trends in the era of human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal cancer.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2010-12-28,"Patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are at elevated risk of second primary malignancies (SPM), most commonly of the head and neck (HN), lung, and esophagus. Our objectives were to identify HNSCC subsite-specific differences in SPM risk and distribution and to describe trends in risk over 3 decades, before and during the era of human papillomavirus (HPV) -associated oropharyngeal SCC. Population-based cohort study of 75,087 patients with HNSCC in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. SPM risk was quantified by using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), excess absolute risk (EAR) per 10,000 person-years at risk (PYR), and number needed to observe. Trends in SPM risk were analyzed by using joinpoint log-linear regression. In patients with HNSCC, the SIR of second primary solid tumor was 2.2 (95% CI, 2.1 to 2.2), and the EAR was 167.7 cancers per 10,000 PYR. The risk of SPM was highest for hypopharyngeal SCC (SIR, 3.5; EAR, 307.1 per 10,000 PYR) and lowest for laryngeal SCC (SIR, 1.9; EAR, 147.8 per 10,000 PYR). The most common SPM site for patients with oral cavity and oropharynx SCC was HN; for patients with laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer, it was the lung. Since 1991, SPM risk has decreased significantly among patients with oropharyngeal SCC (annual percentage change in EAR, -4.6%; P = .03). In patients with HNSCC, the risk and distribution of SPM differ significantly according to subsite of the index cancer. Before the 1990s, hypopharynx and oropharynx cancers carried the highest excess risk of SPM.

Evidence from a wide range of sources suggested that chronic administration of NSAIDs reduced the risk of cancer incidences. Both the epidemiological and animal studies showed an inverse association between the incidence of various cancers and the use of aspirin or other NSAIDs. The chemopreventive and therapeutic interventions of NSAIDs in cancer are obvious; however, the instigation of drug and treatment period depends on the study objective. Typically, prevention involves initiating the medication before the appearance of clinical symptoms and lasts long-term; while treatment could be short-term and contingent to the response of patient to the medication.

The LTS group was significantly more likely to have pathologic complete response (69% vs. 41%, P < 0.001), lower pathologic T stage, i.e., pT0, pTis, or pT1 (83% vs. 45%, P < 0.001), pN0 stage (97% vs. 68%, P < 0.001), favorable tumor differentiation (well or well to moderate, 39% vs. 13%, P < 0.001), and absence of angiolymphatic (88% vs. 69%, P < 0.01) or perineural invasion (95% vs. 83%, P = 0.04). In comparing the factors predictive of outcome in LTS versus the STS with increasing relative risk, absence of perineural invasion (RR 0.41 (0.27, 0.61)), negative margins (RR 0.41 (0.29, 0.57)), absence of angiolymphatic invasion (RR 0.39 (0.30, 0.51)), pN0 stage (RR 1.37 (1.23, 1.52)), pT0 or pT1 (RR 1.85 (1.64, 2.07)), pathologic complete response (RR 2.02 (1.76, 2.31)), and favorable tumor grade (RR 3.00 (2.49, 3.61)) were associated with improved survival.

The role of radiation in the perioperative treatment of esophagogastric cancer.,Current treatment options in oncology,Curr Treat Options Oncol,2011-03-01,"Cancers of the esophagus, stomach, and the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) remain a global health problem. There has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus and EGJ in the past two decades with little change in the poor prognosis associated with these cancers. Previously surgery alone was the mainstay of therapeutic intervention, but high rates of local and systemic failure have prompted investigation into neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy. Treatment paradigms differ across continents, but the unifying theme that has emerged in the past decade implies that surgery alone can no longer be considered the standard of care. The multi-disciplinary management of patients with locally advanced esophagogastric carcinomas using trimodality therapy with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgery confers the greatest opportunity for margin negative resection, improved loco-regional control and cure, and should be the accepted treatment paradigm. The traditional backbone of platinum plus fluorouracil concurrent with radiotherapy may be supplanted by more modern, easier-to-administer regimens incorporating taxanes and irinotecan.

She was monitored perioperatively, at 6 months and at 1 year for worsening of her CREST-related symptoms and complications associated with surgery and radiation therapy. Both surgeon and patient's opinion of her cosmetic outcome were also recorded at 1-year followup. The patient experienced mild acute cellulitic changes in the perioperative period, which resolved with antibiotics. At 6 months, she exhibited a Grade 1 late toxicity, which has remained stable at 1-year followup. The patient and surgeon are very pleased with her cosmetic outcome.

A phase 2 trial of erlotinib in patients with previously treated squamous cell and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-11-08,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have activity in solid tumors. The authors evaluated an oral EGFR TKI, erlotinib, in patients with previously treated esophageal cancer. Thirty patients with measurable, metastatic cancer of the esophageal and gastroesophageal junction received 150 mg erlotinib daily. EGFR-negative tumors (6 patients; 20%) and EGFR-over expressing tumors (24 patients; 80%) were treated. Most patients were men (70%) with adenocarcinoma (57%) and had received previous chemotherapy (97%). Two partial responses were observe d in the EGFR-positive cohort (2 of 24 patients; 8%), and no responses were observed in the EGFR-negative cohort (0 of 6 patients). Reponses were limited to patients who had squamous cell carcinoma (2 of 13 patients; 15%; response duration, 5.5-7 months). The time to tumor progression was longer in patients who had squamous cell carcinoma (3.3 months; range, 1-24 months) compared with patients who had adenocarcinoma (1.6 months; range, 1-6 months; P = .026). Therapy was tolerable with the expected toxicity of skin rash (grade 1-2, 67%; grade 3, 10%). Erlotinib had limited activity in patients with esophageal cancer, and responses and some protracted stable disease were observed in those with squamous cell carcinoma. Efficacy according to EGFR status could not be assessed given the rarity of EGFR-negative tumors.

Smoking and Barrett's esophagus in women who undergo upper endoscopy.,Digestive diseases and sciences,Dig. Dis.

We assessed the association between smoking and pathologically-confirmed Barrett's esophagus (n = 377). Self-reported data on smoking and potential confounding variables were collected from biennial questionnaires. Compared with women who never smoked, former smokers of 1-24 cigarettes/day had a multivariate odds ratio for Barrett's esophagus of 1.25 (95% CI 0.99-1.59), former smokers of ≥ 25 cigarettes/day had a multivariate odds ratio of 1.52 (95% CI 1.04-2.22), current smokers of 1-24 cigarettes/day had a multivariate odds ratio of 0.89 (95% CI 0.54-1.45), and current smokers of ≥ 25 cigarettes/day had a multivariate odds ratio of 0.92 (95% CI 0.34-2.54). The risk for Barrett's esophagus increased significantly with increasing pack-years smoked among former (P = 0.008) but not current smokers (P = 0.99), especially when considering exposure ≥ 25 years before index endoscopy. Results were similar among women reporting regular heartburn/acid-reflux one or more times a week, and were not accounted for by changes in weight.

Prognostic significance of baseline positron emission tomography and importance of clinical complete response in patients with esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy.,Cancer,Cancer,2011-03-31,"Metabolic imaging is of interest in esophageal cancer; however, the usefulness of initial standardized uptake value (SUV) in positron emission tomography (PET) is unknown in patients with esophageal or gastroesophageal carcinoma treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy. The authors hypothesized that initial SUV would correlate with patient outcome. The authors retrospectively analyzed esophageal or gastroesophageal carcinoma patients who had baseline PET and endoscopic ultrasonography in addition to other routine staging. All patients received definitive chemoradiotherapy. Multiple statistical methods were used. The authors analyzed 209 consecutive esophageal or gastroesophageal carcinoma patients treated with definitive chemoradiation for outcome; of these, 180 had baseline PET for additional analyses. The median overall survival (OS) for all patients was 20.7 months (95% confidence interval, 18.8-26.3). Patients with clinical complete response (CR) lived longer than those with less than clinical CR (P < .0001). The median initial SUV was 12.7 (range, 0-51). Higher initial SUV was associated with longer tumors (P = .0001), higher T-stage status (P < .0001), positive N-stage status (P = .0001), higher overall stage (P < .0001), lack of clinical CR (P = .0002), and squamous cell histology (P < .0001). In the univariate analysis, initial SUV was associated with OS (Cox model, P = .016; log-rank test, P = .002). In the multivariate analysis, initial SUV dichotomized by the median value (P = .024) and tumor grade (P = .016) proved to be independent OS prognosticators.

SOX2 gene amplification and protein overexpression are associated with better outcome in squamous cell lung cancer.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2011-04-01,"The transcription factor SOX2 (3q26.3-q27) is a key regulator of foregut development and an embryonic stem cell factor cooperating during induction of pluripotency in terminally differentiated somatic cells. Recently, we found SOX2 to be amplified in a subset of squamous cell lung and esophageal cancers. The aim of this study was to explore the prognostic role of SOX2 in a large series of squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the lung. A total of 891 samples from two independent population-based cohorts were assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, we assessed for associations between SOX2 amplification/upregulation and clinicopathological features. Similar results were found in the two cohorts. Within squamous cell carcinoma cases, 8% high-level as well as 68 and 65% low-level SOX2 amplifications occurred in the two cohorts, respectively. In adenocarcinomas, no high-level amplification was found and low-level amplification occurred in 6% of the two cohorts. Within squamous cell carcinomas of one cohort, SOX2 amplification was associated with lower tumor grade, while higher levels of SOX2 expression were related to younger age, smaller tumor size, and lower probability of angiolymphatic invasion and metastasis. High SOX2 expression levels proved to be a marker for prolonged overall survival among patients with squamous cell carcinomas.

A prospective evaluation of staging and target volume definition of lymph nodes by 18FDG PET/CT in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of thoracic esophagus.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int.

Sixteen patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent radical esophagectomy and three-field LN dissection after 18FDG PET/CT and CT scans were enrolled into this study. Locations of LN groups were recorded according to a uniform LN map. Diagnostic performance of different SUV thresholds was assessed by receiver operating characteristic analysis. The optimal cutoff SUV was determined by plotting the false-negative rate (FNR) and false-positive rate (FPR), the sum of both error rates (FNR+FPR), and accuracy against a hypothetical SUV threshold. For each patient, nodal gross tumor volumes (GTVNs) were generated with CT alone (GTVNCT), PET/CT (GTVNPET), and pathologic data (GTVNpath). GTVNCT or GTVNPET was compared with GTVNpath by means of a conformity index (CI), which is the intersection of the two GTVNs divided by the sum of them minus the intersection, e.g., CICT&path=GTVNCT&path/(GTVNCT+GTVNpath-GTVNCT&path). LN metastases occurred in 21 LN groups among the 144 specimens taken from the 16 patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.9017±0.0410. The plot of error rates showed a minimum of FNR+FPR for an SUV of 2.36, at which the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 76.19%, 95.93%, and 93.06%, respectively, whereas those of CT were 33.33%, 94.31%, and 85.42% (p values: 0.0117, 0.7539, and 0.0266).

Intensity-modulated proton therapy further reduces normal tissue exposure during definitive therapy for locally advanced distal esophageal tumors: a dosimetric study.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2011-04-04,"We have previously found that ≤ 75% of treatment failures after chemoradiotherapy for unresectable esophageal cancer appear within the gross tumor volume and that intensity-modulated (photon) radiotherapy (IMRT) might allow dose escalation to the tumor without increasing normal tissue toxicity. Proton therapy might allow additional dose escalation, with even lower normal tissue toxicity. In the present study, we compared the dosimetric parameters for photon IMRT with that for intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for unresectable, locally advanced, distal esophageal cancer. Four plans were created for each of 10 patients. IMPT was delivered using anteroposterior (AP)/posteroanterior beams, left posterior oblique/right posterior oblique (LPO/RPO) beams, or AP/LPO/RPO beams. IMRT was delivered with a concomitant boost to the gross tumor volume. The dose was 65.8 Gy to the gross tumor volume and 50.4 Gy to the planning target volume in 28 fractions. Relative to IMRT, the IMPT (AP/posteroanterior) plan led to considerable reductions in the mean lung dose (3.18 vs. 8.27 Gy, p<.0001) and the percentage of lung volume receiving 5, 10, and 20 Gy (p≤.0006) but did not reduce the cardiac dose. The IMPT LPO/RPO plan also reduced the mean lung dose (4.9 Gy vs. 8.2 Gy, p<.001), the heart dose (mean cardiac dose and percentage of the cardiac volume receiving 10, 20, and 30 Gy, p≤.02), and the liver dose (mean hepatic dose 5 Gy vs. 14.9 Gy, p<.0001). The IMPT AP/LPO/RPO plan led to considerable reductions in the dose to the lung (p≤.005), heart (p≤.003), and liver (p≤.04). Compared with IMRT, IMPT for distal esophageal cancer lowered the dose to the heart, lung, and liver. The AP/LPO/RPO beam arrangement was optimal for sparing all three organs.

Minimally invasive esophagectomy is safe and effective following neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2011-04-09,"Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) is technically demanding, and implementation has been hindered by a steep learning curve. Despite widespread concern about the successful performance of this procedure following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACR) treatment, we hypothesized that safe and effective MIE could be performed in this setting. We reviewed our prospective database of patients undergoing MIE for esophageal cancer at our institution between January 2008 and February 2010. We analyzed the association of NACR on perioperative outcomes and compared them with those patients undergoing MIE without NACR. NACR was used in ≥T2 or N+ tumors. A total of 61 consecutive patients underwent a planned MIE. A complete MIE or hybrid procedure was performed in 58 patients (95%), while 3 patients were unresectable. Median age was 67 years (range 38-85). Anastomoses were performed in the cervical region in 47 patients (81%) while 11 patients had an anastomosis in the right chest. Serious complications included: 3 cervical anastomotic leaks (5%), 2 thoracic duct leaks (4%), 12 pneumonias (21%), 10 atrial fibrillations (18%), and 1 death in a patient not undergoing NACR. NACR was used in 41 patients. There was no significant difference in estimated blood loss (EBL), complications, or negative pathologic margins in patients undergoing NACR with MIE vs. MIE alone (P=NS). Median number of lymph nodes excised and PostOp LOS was 15 and 11 in patients undergoing NACR compared with 13 and 9 in those undergoing MIE alone (P=NS). MIE is safe following NACR.

A Phase II study of a paclitaxel-based chemoradiation regimen with selective surgical salvage for resectable locoregionally advanced esophageal cancer: initial reporting of RTOG 0246.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2011-04-18,"The strategy of definitive chemoradiation with selective surgical salvage in locoregionally advanced esophageal cancer was evaluated in a Phase II trial in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)-affiliated sites. The study was designed to detect an improvement in 1-year survival from 60% to 77.5% (α = 0.05; power = 80%). Definitive chemoradiation involved induction chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (650 mg/mg(2)/day), cisplatin (15 mg/mg(2)/day), and paclitaxel (200 mg/mg(2)/day) for two cycles, followed by concurrent chemoradiation with 50.4 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction) and daily 5-FU (300 mg/mg(2)/day) with cisplatin (15 mg/mg(2)/day) over the first 5 days. Salvage surgical resection was considered for patients with residual or recurrent esophageal cancer who did not have systemic disease. Forty-three patients with nonmetastatic resectable esophageal cancer were entered from Sept 2003 to March 2006. Forty-one patients were eligible for analysis. Clinical stage was ≥T3 in 31 patients (76%) and N1 in 29 patients (71%), with adenocarcinoma histology in 30 patients (73%). Thirty-seven patients (90%) completed induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation. Twenty-eight patients (68%) experienced Grade 3+ nonhematologic toxicity. Four treatment-related deaths were noted. Twenty-one patients underwent surgery following definitive chemoradiation because of residual (17 patients) or recurrent (3 patients) esophageal cancer,and 1 patient because of choice. Median follow-up of live patients was 22 months, with an estimated 1-year survival of 71%. In this Phase II trial (RTOG 0246) evaluating selective surgical salvage after definitive chemoradiation in locoregionally advanced esophageal cancer, the hypothesized 1-year RTOG survival rate (77.5%) was not achieved (1 year, 71%; 95% confidence interval< 54%-82%).","Clinical Trial, Phase II",3200.0,51.0,The strategy of definitive chemoradiation with selective surgical salvage in locoregionally advanced cancer was evaluated in a Phase II trial in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group RTOG -affiliated sites The study was designed to detect an improvement in 1-year survival from 60 to 77.5 0.05 power 80 Definitive chemoradiation involved induction chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil 5-FU 650 mg/mg 2 /day cisplatin 15 mg/mg 2 /day and paclitaxel 200 mg/mg 2 /day for two cycles followed by concurrent chemoradiation with 50.4 Gy 1.8 Gy/fraction and daily 5-FU 300 mg/mg 2 /day with cisplatin 15 mg/mg 2 /day over the first 5 days Salvage surgical resection was considered for patients with residual or recurrent cancer who did not have systemic disease Forty-three patients with nonmetastatic resectable cancer were entered from Sept 2003 to March 2006 Forty-one patients were eligible for analysis Clinical stage was ≥T3 in 31 patients 76 and N1 in 29 patients 71 with adenocarcinoma histology in 30 patients 73 Thirty-seven patients 90 completed induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation Twenty-eight patients 68 experienced Grade 3+ nonhematologic toxicity Four treatment-related deaths were noted Twenty-one patients underwent surgery following definitive chemoradiation because of residual 17 patients or recurrent 3 patients cancer and 1 patient because of choice Median follow-up of live patients was 22 months with an estimated 1-year survival of 71 In this Phase II trial RTOG 0246 evaluating selective surgical salvage after definitive chemoradiation in locoregionally advanced cancer the hypothesized 1-year RTOG survival rate 77.5 was not achieved 1 year 71 95 confidence interval 54 -82,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[3, 692, 1, 1057, 975, 5, 1094, 221, 992, 4, 6410, 131, 12, 10, 194, 4, 8, 124, 215, 160, 4, 121, 36, 413, 87, 3931, 9048, 633, 3, 45, 10, 1114, 6, 1426, 35, 767, 4, 14, 111, 25, 29, 335, 6, 849, 33, 13, 474, 2349, 493, 1057, 975, 646, 504, 56, 5, 33, 1404, 33, 1296, 8642, 81, 81, 18, 218, 540, 167, 81, 81, 18, 218, 2, 490, 1250, 81, 81, 18, 218, 9, 100, 410, 370, 20, 750, 975, 5, 212, 39, 381, 14, 66, 381, 1509, 2, 391, 33, 1296, 2036, 81, 81, 18, 218, 5, 540, 167, 81, 81, 18, 218, 252, 3, 157, 33, 162, 992, 221, 170, 10, 515, 9, 7, 5, 753, 15, 387, 12, 54, 205, 44, 47, 403, 34, 1213, 169, 7, 5, 2683, 1899, 12, 11, 2836, 29, 8708, 1522, 6, 2363, 1324, 1213, 104, 7, 11, 625, 9, 65, 38, 82, 10, 25294, 4, 456, 7, 846, 2, 3192, 4, 462, 7, 792, 5, 449, 784, 4, 201, 7, 803, 977, 648, 7, 424, 781, 504, 56, 370, 20, 750, 975, 737, 659, 7, 806, 592, 88, 27, 3534, 155, 294, 24, 139, 1043, 11, 1051, 737, 104, 7, 208, 152, 366, 1057, 975, 408, 1, 753, 269, 7, 15, 387, 27, 7, 12, 2, 14, 69, 408, 1, 1866, 52, 166, 126, 1, 3812, 7, 10, 350, 53, 5, 35, 661, 14, 111, 25, 1, 792, 4, 26, 124, 215, 160, 3931, 39623, 1435, 1094, 221, 992, 50, 1057, 975, 4, 6410, 131, 12, 3, 1237, 14, 111, 3931, 25, 116, 849, 33, 10, 44, 513, 14, 111, 792, 48, 307, 268, 667, 878]",1711.0,21507583,28

Genetic variation in DNA-repair pathways and response to radiochemotherapy in esophageal adenocarcinoma: a retrospective cohort study of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.,BMC cancer,BMC Cancer,2011-05-17,"Recent data in esophageal cancer suggests the variant allele of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in XRCC1 may be associated with resistance to radiochemotherapy. However, this SNP has not been assessed in a histologically homogeneous clinical trial cohort that has been treated with a uniform approach. In addition, whether germline DNA may serve as a surrogate for tumor genotype at this locus is unknown in this disease. Our objective was to assess this SNP in relation to the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in subjects with esophageal adenocarcinoma who received cisplatin-based preoperative radiochemotherapy in a multicenter clinical trial (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 1201). As a secondary aim, we investigated the rate of allelic imbalance between germline and tumor DNA. Eighty-one eligible treatment-naïve subjects with newly diagnosed resectable esophageal adenocarcinoma received radiotherapy (45 Gy) concurrent with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, with planned subsequent surgical resection. The primary endpoint was pCR, defined as complete absence of tumor in the surgical specimen after radiochemotherapy. Using germline DNA from 60 subjects, we examined the base-excision repair SNP, XRCC1 Arg399Gln, and 4 other SNPs in nucleotide excision (XPD Lys751Gln and Asp312Asn, ERCC1 3' flank) and double-stranded break (XRCC2 5' flank) repair pathways, and correlated genotype with pCR rate. Paired tumor tissue was used to estimate the frequency of allelic imbalance at the XRCC1 SNP. The variant allele of the XRCC1 SNP (399Gln) was detected in 52% of subjects. Only 6% of subjects with the variant allele experienced a pCR, compared to 28% of subjects without the variant allele (odds ratio 5.37 for failing to achieve pCR, p = 0.062). Allelic imbalance at this locus was found in only 10% of informative subjects, suggesting that germline genotype may reflect tumor genotype at this locus. No significant association with pCR was noted for other SNPs.

Duplicated muscularis mucosae invasion has similar risk of lymph node metastasis and recurrence-free survival as intramucosal esophageal adenocarcinoma.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2011-07-01,"Duplicated muscularis mucosae (MM) in early esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) can cause overstaging of the disease on endoscopic ultrasound and pathology specimens. No study has determined the correlation between lymph node metastasis and invasion in the space between duplicated MM in pathologic tumor stage (pT) 1 EAC. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides from surgically resected pT1 EAC (n=99) were reviewed for tumor configuration, grade, level of invasion (lamina propria/inner MM, space between duplicated MM, and submucosa), quantitative depth of invasion in millimeter, and lymphovascular invasion (LVI). These pathologic characteristics were correlated with lymph node status and recurrence-free survival (RFS). All specimens had duplicated MM with thick-walled blood vessels. Tumor differentiation was well in 37, moderate in 47, and poor in 15 specimens. EAC invaded the lamina propria/inner MM in 28 cases, duplicated MM space in 41 cases, and submucosa in 30 cases. LVI was identified in 23 tumors. Eleven patients had lymph node metastasis. Quantitative depth of invasion as a continuous variable (P=0.002), poorly differentiated histology (P=0.028), presence of LVI (P=0.001), and submucosal invasion versus duplicated MM/lamina propria invasion (P=0.02) were associated with increased risk of lymph node metastasis and shorter RFS by univariate analysis. By multivariate analysis, LVI was an independent predictor of lymph node status and RFS.

Evaluation of difluoromethylornithine for the chemoprevention of Barrett's esophagus and mucosal dysplasia.,"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",Cancer Prev Res (Phila),2011-06-01,"Patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) and dysplasia are candidates for chemopreventive strategies to reduce cancer risk. We determined the effects of difluoromethylornithine (DMFO) on mucosal polyamines, gene expression, and histopathology in BE. Ten patients with BE and low-grade dysplasia participated in a single-arm study of DFMO (0.5 g/m(2)/d) given continuously for 6 months. Esophagoscopy with biopsies was conducted at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Dysplasia was graded by a gastrointestinal pathologist. Audiology was assessed (at baseline and at 6 months). Mucosal polyamines were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Microarray-based gene expression was analyzed using a cDNA two-color chip. DFMO suppressed levels of the polyamines putrescine (P = 0.02) and spermidine (P = 0.02) and the spermidine/spermine ratio (P < 0.01) in dysplastic BE (6 months vs. baseline) that persisted at 6 months following drug cessation. Among the top 25 modulated genes, we found those regulating p53-mediated cell signaling (RPL11), cell-cycle regulation (cyclin E2), and cell adhesion and invasion (Plexin1). DFMO downregulated Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), a transcription factor promoting cell proliferation, and suppressed RFC5 whose protein interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Histopathology showed regression of dysplasia (n = 1), stable disease (n = 8), and progression to high-grade dysplasia (n = 1).

A novel small molecule inhibitor of FAK and IGF-1R protein interactions decreases growth of human esophageal carcinoma.,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,2011-09-01,"Esophageal cancer remains an aggressive disease with poor survival rates. FAK and IGF-1R are two important tyrosine kinases important for cell survival signaling and found to be upregulated in esophageal cancer. Our hypothesis is that a novel small molecule compound that disrupts FAK and IGF-1R protein-protein interactions (PPIs) would decrease the growth of human esophageal cancer. The compound INT2-31 (NSC344553) was identified from a virtual high throughput screen to bind to FAK and disrupt PPIs. The in vitro effects of this compound, +/- 5-FU chemotherapy, on cell signaling, viability and apoptosis in human esophageal cancer cells (KYSE 70, 140) and a direct esophageal cancer xenograft was evaluated. INT2-31 caused a disruption of PPIs between FAK and IGF-1R starting at a concentration of 1μM. It also caused a dose dependent inhibition of cell viability and induction of apoptosis at low micromolar doses. These effects were associated with decreased AKT and ERK1/ERK2 phosphorylation. INT2-31 treatment, when administered via IP injection, at 50mg/kg, resulted in an in vivo decrease in tumor growth in a direct xenograft. Furthermore, treatment with 5-FU chemotherapy combined with INT2-31 resulted in a synergistic increase in apoptosis and decrease in tumor growth compared to 5-FU or INT2-31 alone. A novel compound that disrupts the PPIs of FAK and IGF-1R results in decreased tumor proliferation and increased apoptosis. These effects appear to be mediated through downregulation of p-AKT and p-ERK.

Use of multimodality neoadjuvant therapy for esophageal cancer in the United States: assessment of 987 hospitals.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2011-07-20,"Consensus guidelines recommend neoadjuvant therapy in locally advanced esophageal cancer; however, whether this recommendation has been widely adopted is unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the utilization of neoadjuvant therapy in esophageal cancer and its association with outcomes in the United States. From the National Cancer Data Base all patients with middle and lower third clinical stage I-III esophageal cancers who underwent surgical resection were identified (1998-2007). Multivariable regression models were developed to identify predictors of neoadjuvant therapy use and associated outcomes. We identified 8562 patients who underwent surgical resection for esophageal cancer. In nonmetastatic locally advanced tumors, neoadjuvant therapy use increased (stage II 47.9% to 72.5%; stage III 51.0% to 90.1%; P < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, factors associated with the decreased use of neoadjuvant therapy for stage II and III disease were age ≥75 years, Medicare insurance coverage, Charlson score ≥2, stage II (vs. III) disease, and geographic region. Patients with stage II and III disease who underwent neoadjuvant therapy had a lower risk of positive lymph nodes (odds ratio [OR] 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35-0.55) and positive surgical margins (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.38-0.69).

Genome-wide multiplatform approaches may lead to the identification of genes important in BE/EAC development. To identify risk alleles or mutated genes associated with BE/EAC. Model-free linkage analyses of 21 concordant-affected sibling pairs with BE/EAC and 11 discordant sibling pairs (2005-2006). Significant germline genomic regions in independent prospectively accrued series of 176 white patients with BE/EAC and 200 ancestry-matched controls (2007-2010) were validated and fine mapped. Integrating data from these significant genomic regions with somatic gene expression data from 19 BE/EAC tissues yielded 12 ""priority"" candidate genes for mutation analysis (2010). Genes that showed mutations in cases but not in controls were further screened in an independent prospectively accrued validation series of 58 cases (2010). Identification of germline mutations in genes associated with BE/EAC cases. Functional interrogation of the most commonly mutated gene. Three major genes, MSR1, ASCC1, and CTHRC1 were associated with BE/EAC (all P < .001). In addition, 13 patients (11.2%) with BE/EAC carried germline mutations in MSR1, ASCC1, or CTHRC1. MSR1 was the most frequently mutated, with 8 of 116 (proportion, 0.069; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.030-0.130; P < .001) cases with c.877C>T (p.R293X). An independent validation series confirmed germline MSR1 mutations in 2 of 58 cases (proportion, 0.035; 95% CI, 0.004-0.120; P = .09). MSR1 mutation resulted in CCND1 up-regulation in peripheral-protein lysate. Immunohistochemistry of BE tissues in MSR1-mutation carriers showed increased nuclear expression of CCND1. MSR1 was significantly associated with the presence of BE/EAC in derivation and validation samples, although it was only present in a small percentage of the cases.",Journal Article,3126.0,66.0,Barrett BE occurs in 1 to 10 of the general population and is believed to be the precursor of adenocarcinoma EAC The incidence of EAC has increased 350 in the last 3 decades without clear etiology Finding predisposition genes may improve premorbid risk assessment genetic counseling and management Genome-wide multiplatform approaches may lead to the identification of genes important in BE/EAC development To identify risk alleles or mutated genes associated with BE/EAC Model-free linkage analyses of 21 concordant-affected sibling pairs with BE/EAC and 11 discordant sibling pairs 2005-2006 Significant germline genomic regions in independent prospectively accrued series of 176 white patients with BE/EAC and 200 ancestry-matched controls 2007-2010 were validated and fine mapped Integrating data from these significant genomic regions with somatic gene expression data from 19 BE/EAC tissues yielded 12 `` priority '' candidate genes for mutation analysis 2010 Genes that showed mutations in cases but not in controls were further screened in an independent prospectively accrued validation series of 58 cases 2010 Identification of germline mutations in genes associated with BE/EAC cases Functional interrogation of the most commonly mutated gene Three major genes MSR1 ASCC1 and CTHRC1 were associated with BE/EAC all P .001 In addition 13 patients 11.2 with BE/EAC carried germline mutations in MSR1 ASCC1 or CTHRC1 MSR1 was the most frequently mutated with 8 of 116 proportion 0.069 95 confidence interval CI 0.030-0.130 P .001 cases with c.877C T p.R293X An independent validation series confirmed germline MSR1 mutations in 2 of 58 cases proportion 0.035 95 CI 0.004-0.120 P .09 MSR1 mutation resulted in CCND1 up-regulation in peripheral-protein lysate Immunohistochemistry of BE tissues in MSR1-mutation carriers showed increased nuclear expression of CCND1 MSR1 was significantly associated with the presence of BE/EAC in derivation and validation samples although it was only present in a small percentage of the cases,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[4366, 40, 1780, 4, 14, 6, 79, 1, 3, 1083, 266, 2, 16, 3979, 6, 40, 3, 2765, 1, 449, 3378, 3, 287, 1, 3378, 71, 101, 5408, 4, 3, 1060, 27, 1968, 187, 885, 2855, 1567, 2863, 214, 68, 401, 35000, 43, 455, 336, 2011, 2, 284, 898, 1019, 16542, 611, 68, 1122, 6, 3, 911, 1, 214, 305, 4, 40, 3378, 193, 6, 255, 43, 2558, 15, 1185, 214, 41, 5, 40, 3378, 202, 115, 4820, 318, 1, 239, 3610, 1424, 3684, 2773, 5, 40, 3378, 2, 175, 4570, 3684, 2773, 1242, 1324, 93, 1009, 572, 1374, 4, 306, 1143, 3198, 988, 1, 5800, 886, 7, 5, 40, 3378, 2, 1250, 3535, 655, 535, 1307, 1120, 11, 938, 2, 2924, 6224, 4568, 74, 29, 46, 93, 572, 1374, 5, 1119, 145, 55, 74, 29, 326, 40, 3378, 742, 2178, 133, 4690, 522, 1609, 214, 9, 258, 65, 1120, 214, 17, 224, 138, 4, 140, 84, 44, 4, 535, 11, 195, 2261, 4, 35, 306, 1143, 3198, 929, 988, 1, 717, 140, 1120, 911, 1, 1009, 138, 4, 214, 41, 5, 40, 3378, 140, 583, 8956, 1, 3, 96, 841, 1185, 145, 169, 458, 214, 25374, 46695, 2, 46696, 11, 41, 5, 40, 3378, 62, 19, 144, 4, 352, 233, 7, 175, 18, 5, 40, 3378, 2629, 1009, 138, 4, 25374, 46695, 15, 46696, 25374, 10, 3, 96, 746, 1185, 5, 66, 1, 3790, 920, 13, 13673, 48, 307, 268, 58, 13, 6542, 13, 3431, 19, 144, 140, 5, 256, 60402, 102, 19, 60403, 35, 306, 929, 988, 557, 1009, 25374, 138, 4, 18, 1, 717, 140, 920, 13, 4514, 48, 58, 13, 1520, 13, 2031, 19, 1730, 25374, 258, 627, 4, 5737, 126, 863, 4, 672, 178, 8758, 888, 1, 40, 742, 4, 25374, 258, 1316, 224, 101, 928, 55, 1, 5737, 25374, 10, 97, 41, 5, 3, 463, 1, 40, 3378, 4, 9859, 2, 929, 347, 242, 192, 10, 158, 364, 4, 8, 302, 1150, 1, 3, 140]",2034.0,21791690,45
Decreasing morbidity and mortality in 100 consecutive minimally invasive esophagectomies.,Surgical endoscopy,Surg Endosc,2011-07-27,"Esophagectomy is a complex invasive procedure that requires exploration of multiple body cavities for removal and subsequent restoration of gastrointestinal continuity. In many institutions, esophagectomy morbidity and mortality rates remain high despite improvement of intensive care treatment. We reviewed our minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) experience of a consecutive series of 100 patients to analyze trends in morbidity and mortality as we transitioned from open to MIE. A total of 105 consecutive patients who underwent operative exploration for esophagectomy from August 2007 to January 2011 were reviewed. The preoperative evaluation, operative technique, and postoperative care of these cases were evaluated and analyzed for 100 patients who have had a MIE and compared with 32 open esophagectomies 2 years prior. During the time frame of the study, 105 patients underwent an exploration for attempted esophagectomy. Resection was completed in 100 patients and was done for malignant disease in 95 patients and benign disease in 5 patients. There was one in hospital mortality due to a pulmonary embolism. There was no significant difference in postoperative complications consisting of transient left recurrent nerve injury (7 vs. 12.5%) or pneumonia (9 vs. 15.6%) in those who underwent MIE compared with open resection. However, wound infections were significantly less in patients who underwent MIE compared with open esophagectomy (1 vs. 12.5%, respectively, p = 0.01). Anastomotic leak (4 vs. 12.5%, p = 0.05) also was lower in those who underwent MIE. Median length of stay (LOS) was significantly less in patients who underwent MIE compared with open esophagectomy (7.5 vs. 14 days, p < 0.05). Finally, there was a trend toward improvement in median LOS in the 30 patients who underwent MIE during the most recent time period compared with the initial 17 patients who underwent MIE (7.5 vs. 10 days, p = 0.05) Our results support the continued safe use of esophagectomy for selected esophageal diseases, including malignancy.

The goal of this study was to determine how alterations of 4 frequently affected genes correlate with the range of histopathologic lesions observed in resected esophagi of patients with Barrett's esophagus. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to assess 83 tissue sections from 10 Barrett's esophagus esophagogastrectomy specimens for chromosomal alterations of 8q24 (MYC), 9p21 (CDKN2A; alias P16), 17q12 (ERBB2), and 20q13.2 (ZNF217). Histologic lesions assessed included gastric metaplasia (n = 8), intestinal metaplasia (n = 43), low-grade dysplasia (n = 28), high-grade dysplasia (n = 25), and adenocarcinoma (n = 16). Histologic maps showing the correlation between fluorescence in situ hybridization abnormalities and corresponding histology were created for all patients. Chromosomal abnormalities included 9p21 loss, single locus gain, and polysomy. A greater number of chromosomal alterations were detected as the severity of histologic diagnosis increased from intestinal metaplasia to adenocarcinoma. All patients had alterations involving the CDKN2A gene. CDKN2A loss was the only abnormality detected in 20 (47%) of 43 areas of intestinal metaplasia.

"Risk factors for esophageal and gastric cancers in Shanxi Province, China: a case-control study.",Cancer epidemiology,Cancer Epidemiol,2011-08-16,"Smoking and alcohol consumption explain little of the risk for upper-gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer in China, where over half of all cases in the world occur. We evaluated questionnaire-based risk factors for UGI cancers in a case-control study from Shanxi Province, China, including 600 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs), 599 gastric cardia adenocarcinomas (GCAs), 316 gastric noncardia adenocarcinomas (GNCAs), and 1514 age- and gender-matched controls.

Residual setup errors and dose variations with less-than-daily image guided patient setup in external beam radiotherapy for esophageal cancer.,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,Radiother Oncol,2011-08-27,"To evaluate residual patient setup errors and daily dose variations of different less-than-daily image guidance (IG) strategies in the delivery of external beam radiotherapy for esophageal cancer. Daily image-guided setup data for 25 consecutive esophageal cancer patients treated with helical tomotherapy were evaluated. Seven less-than-daily IG strategies with different imaging frequencies were simulated. For each IG strategy, the daily residual setup errors were calculated. Using TomoTherapy Planned Adaptive software, daily dose variations to the clinical target volume, heart, and lungs were evaluated in five representative patients. With 0% (60%) IG frequency, the margins required for adequate coverage of the clinical target volume were 13 mm (10 mm), 14 mm (11 mm), and 5 mm (5 mm) in the left-right, superior-inferior, and anterior-posterior directions, respectively. Even with 60% IG frequency, 10% of the fractions had more than 10% decrease in the dose level covering 95% of the target, and 14% and 13% of the fractions had more than 10% increase in total lung volume receiving at least 0.8 Gy per fraction, and heart volume receiving at least 1.2 Gy per fraction, respectively.

Does the timing of esophagectomy after chemoradiation affect outcome?,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2011-10-01,"After neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CXRT) for esophageal cancer, surgery has traditionally been recommended to be performed within 8 weeks. However, surgery is often delayed for various reasons. Data from other cancers suggest that delaying surgery may increase the pathologic complete response rate. However, there are theoretical concerns that waiting longer after radiation may lead to a more difficult operation and more complications. The optimal timing of esophagectomy after CXRT is unknown. From a prospective database, we analyzed 266 patients with resected esophageal cancer who were treated with neoadjuvant CXRT from 2002 to 2008. Salvage resections were excluded from this analysis. We compared patients who had surgery within 8 weeks of CXRT and those who had surgery after 8 weeks. We used multivariable analysis to determine whether increased interval between chemoradiation and surgery was independently associated with perioperative complication, pathologic response, or overall survival. One hundred fifty patients were resected within 8 weeks and 116 were resected greater than 8 weeks after completing CXRT. Mean length of operation, intraoperative blood loss, anastomotic leak rate, and perioperative complication rate were similar for the two groups. Pathologic complete response rate and overall survival were also similar for the two groups (p=not significant).

The primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR). Positron emission tomography (PET) scan was performed prior to chemotherapy and as restaging prior to radiotherapy. Fifty-five patients were evaluable, 75% of whom had adenocarcinoma and 65% of whom had uT3N1 disease. Thirty-eight patients underwent R0 resection (69%). The incidence of pCR was 16% (95% confidence interval, 8%-29%). Median overall survival was 31.7 months.

Prognostic impact of body mass index stratified by smoking status in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2011-10-11,"Given that smoking affects body mass index (BMI) and survival, stratification by smoking status may be required to determine the true prognostic impact of BMI. Although obesity increases risk for developing esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), the prognostic influence of obesity and its potential modification by smoking status is unknown in this disease. All patients (N = 778) underwent potentially curative esophagectomy. BMI was calculated using measured height and weight at surgery and categorized as obese (≥ 30 kg/m(2)), overweight (25 to 29.9 kg/m(2)), or normal (18.5 to 24.9 kg/m(2)). Cigarette smoking was categorized as never or ever. The association of BMI with disease-specific survival (DSS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) was determined by Cox regression. Excess BMI was significantly associated with DSS in a manner that differed substantially by smoking status (P for interaction = .023). Among never smokers, obesity was significantly associated with adverse DSS (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.11; 95% CI, 1.31 to 3.43; P = .002), DFS (HR = 2.03; 95% CI, 1.30 to 3.18; P = .002), and OS (HR = 1.97; 95% CI, 1.24 to 3.14; P = .004), as compared with normal weight, after adjusting for covariates. By contrast, among ever smokers, obesity was not prognostic, and overweight status was significantly associated with favorable survival in univariate, but not multivariate, analysis. Obesity among never smokers was independently associated with two-fold worsening of DSS, DFS, and OS after surgery for EAC, after adjusting for known prognostic factors. These data, in one of the largest reported resected EAC cohorts, are the first to show an adverse prognostic impact of obesity in EAC.",Journal Article,3024.0,48.0,Given that smoking affects body mass index BMI and survival stratification by smoking status may be required to determine the true prognostic impact of BMI Although obesity increases risk for developing adenocarcinoma EAC the prognostic influence of obesity and its potential modification by smoking status is unknown in this disease All patients N 778 underwent potentially curative esophagectomy BMI was calculated using measured height and weight at surgery and categorized as obese ≥ 30 kg/m 2 overweight 25 to 29.9 kg/m 2 or normal 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m 2 Cigarette smoking was categorized as never or ever The association of BMI with disease-specific survival DSS disease-free survival DFS and overall survival OS was determined by Cox regression Excess BMI was significantly associated with DSS in a manner that differed substantially by smoking status P for interaction .023 Among never smokers obesity was significantly associated with adverse DSS hazard ratio HR 2.11 95 CI 1.31 to 3.43 P .002 DFS HR 2.03 95 CI 1.30 to 3.18 P .002 and OS HR 1.97 95 CI 1.24 to 3.14 P .004 as compared with normal weight after adjusting for covariates By contrast among ever smokers obesity was not prognostic and overweight status was significantly associated with favorable survival in univariate but not multivariate analysis Obesity among never smokers was independently associated with two-fold worsening of DSS DFS and OS after surgery for EAC after adjusting for known prognostic factors These data in one of the largest reported resected EAC cohorts are the first to show an adverse prognostic impact of obesity in EAC,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[447, 17, 979, 2561, 642, 782, 558, 1140, 2, 25, 1541, 20, 979, 156, 68, 40, 616, 6, 223, 3, 2501, 177, 345, 1, 1140, 242, 1661, 1106, 43, 9, 931, 449, 3378, 3, 177, 1054, 1, 1661, 2, 211, 174, 2437, 20, 979, 156, 16, 860, 4, 26, 34, 62, 7, 78, 11751, 208, 751, 1075, 3617, 1140, 10, 981, 75, 644, 4594, 2, 924, 28, 152, 2, 2320, 22, 2209, 749, 201, 503, 188, 18, 3566, 243, 6, 462, 83, 503, 188, 18, 15, 295, 203, 33, 6, 259, 83, 503, 188, 18, 4870, 979, 10, 2320, 22, 1737, 15, 3353, 3, 248, 1, 1140, 5, 34, 112, 25, 1788, 34, 115, 25, 1010, 2, 63, 25, 118, 10, 509, 20, 418, 320, 2612, 1140, 10, 97, 41, 5, 1788, 4, 8, 1708, 17, 2512, 2109, 20, 979, 156, 19, 9, 915, 4482, 107, 1737, 1485, 1661, 10, 97, 41, 5, 290, 1788, 360, 197, 168, 18, 175, 48, 58, 14, 456, 6, 27, 601, 19, 1111, 1010, 168, 18, 680, 48, 58, 14, 201, 6, 27, 203, 19, 1111, 2, 118, 168, 14, 1015, 48, 58, 14, 259, 6, 27, 213, 19, 1520, 22, 72, 5, 295, 924, 50, 1358, 9, 2489, 20, 748, 107, 3353, 1485, 1661, 10, 44, 177, 2, 3566, 156, 10, 97, 41, 5, 913, 25, 4, 880, 84, 44, 331, 65, 1661, 107, 1737, 1485, 10, 1042, 41, 5, 100, 1116, 4323, 1, 1788, 1010, 2, 118, 50, 152, 9, 3378, 50, 1358, 9, 440, 177, 130, 46, 74, 4, 104, 1, 3, 2166, 210, 1133, 3378, 736, 32, 3, 157, 6, 514, 35, 290, 177, 345, 1, 1661, 4, 3378]",1615.0,21990414,687
Effect of histologic subtype on treatment and outcomes for esophageal cancer in the United States.,Cancer,Cancer,2011-10-17,"Esophageal adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) have distinct clinico-pathologic characteristics; however, it is unclear whether treatment patterns differ by histologic subtype. The objective of this study was to examine differences in treatment use and outcomes by histologic subtype for esophageal cancer in the United States. From the National Cancer Data Base, patients with esophageal cancer were identified. Regression models were formulated to assess the influence of histologic subtype on treatment use and overall survival. From 1998 to 2007, 80,961 patients were identified with esophageal cancer in the United States. A higher percentage of patients with nonmetastatic AC underwent surgical resection compared with patients with nonmetastatic SCC (AC, 65.7%; SCC, 36.0%; P<.001), who were more often treated with chemoradiotherapy alone (AC, 25.7%; SCC, 54.1%; P<.001). High-volume academic centers used surgery more frequently for both AC and SCC than did other centers, yet even at high-volume academic centers, surgery was used much less often to treat SCC than AC (AC, 79.3%; SCC, 53.7%; P<.001).

Family history of cancer and non-malignant diseases and risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a Children's Oncology Group Study.,Cancer epidemiology,Cancer Epidemiol,2011-10-21,"Studies of family history of cancer and non-malignant diseases in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) show inconsistent findings. Most studies show no increased risk with family history of cancer. Non-malignant diseases such as allergic diseases, autoimmune diseases, birth defects and thyroid diseases have been reported to be associated with ALL. We conducted a case-control study of family history of cancer and selected non-malignant conditions (allergic diseases, autoimmune diseases, birth defects, and thyroid diseases). ALL cases were obtained from Children's Cancer Group institutions from January 1989 to June 1993. Controls were recruited via random digit dialing. Family history for first degree relatives and grandparents of ALL cases and controls was collected by structured telephone questionnaires. Conditional logistical regression was used to calculate odds ratios adjusting for potential confounders. We found a borderline association of ALL and having a family member with a history of cancer in cases (n=1842) compared to controls (n=1986) (OR=0.98, 95%CI=0.93, 1.00) and an inverse association for esophageal cancer based on small numbers. Family history of food and drug allergies demonstrated a modestly reduced risk (OR=0.83, 95%CI=0.73, 0.95) as did family history of rheumatoid arthritis (OR=0.79, 95%CI=0.65, 0.96). There were no associations with family history of any autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiencies, birth defects, thyroid diseases and risk of childhood ALL. These results show no association of overall family history of cancer with childhood ALL, while providing additional evidence for an inverse association with family history of allergic disease.

BRAF mutations in advanced cancers: clinical characteristics and outcomes.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2011-10-19,"Oncogenic BRAF mutations have been found in diverse malignancies and activate RAF/MEK/ERK signaling, a critical pathway of tumorigenesis. We examined the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with mutant (mut) BRAF advanced cancer referred to phase 1 clinic. We reviewed the records of 80 consecutive patients with mutBRAF advanced malignancies and 149 with wild-type (wt) BRAF (matched by tumor type) referred to the Clinical Center for Targeted Therapy and analyzed their outcome. Of 80 patients with mutBRAF advanced cancer, 56 had melanoma, 10 colorectal, 11 papillary thyroid, 2 ovarian and 1 esophageal cancer. Mutations in codon 600 were found in 77 patients (62, V600E; 13, V600K; 1, V600R; 1, unreported). Multivariate analysis showed less soft tissue (Odds ratio (OR) = 0.39, 95%CI: 0.20-0.77, P = 0.007), lung (OR = 0.38, 95%CI: 0.19-0.73, p = 0.004) and retroperitoneal metastases (OR = 0.34, 95%CI: 0.13-0.86, p = 0.024) and more brain metastases (OR = 2.05, 95%CI: 1.02-4.11, P = 0.043) in patients with mutBRAF versus wtBRAF. Comparing to the corresponding wtBRAF, mutBRAF melanoma patients had insignificant trend to longer median survival from diagnosis (131 vs. 78 months, p = 0.14), while mutBRAF colorectal cancer patients had an insignificant trend to shorter median survival from diagnosis (48 vs. 53 months, p = 0.22). In melanoma, V600K mutations in comparison to other BRAF mutations were associated with more frequent brain (75% vs. 36.3%, p = 0.02) and lung metastases (91.6% vs. 47.7%, p = 0.007), and shorter time from diagnosis to metastasis and to death (19 vs. 53 months, p = 0.046 and 78 vs. 322 months, p = 0.024 respectively).

MET amplification identifies a small and aggressive subgroup of esophagogastric adenocarcinoma with evidence of responsiveness to crizotinib.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2011-10-31,"Amplification of the MET proto-oncogene in gastroesophageal cancer (GEC) may constitute a molecular marker for targeted therapy. We examined a GEC cohort with follow-up and reported the clinical response of four additional patients with MET-amplified tumors to the small molecule inhibitor crizotinib as part of an expanded phase I cohort study. From 2007 to 2009, patients with GEC were genetically screened as a consecutive series of 489 tumors (stages 0, I, and II, 39%; III, 25%; IV, 36%; n = 222 esophageal, including n = 21 squamous carcinomas). MET, EGFR, and HER2 amplification status was assessed by using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Ten (2%) of 489 patients screened harbored MET amplification; 23 (4.7%) harbored EGFR amplification; 45 (8.9%) harbored HER2 amplification; and 411 (84%) were wild type for all three genes (ie, negative). MET-amplified tumors were typically high-grade adenocarcinomas that presented at advanced stages (5%; n = 4 of 80). EGFR-amplified tumors showed the highest fraction of squamous cell carcinoma (17%; n = 4 of 23). HER2, MET, and EGFR amplification were, with one exception (MET and EGFR positive), mutually exclusive events. Survival analysis in patients with stages III and IV disease showed substantially shorter median survival in MET/EGFR-amplified groups, with a rank order for all groups by median survival (from most to least aggressive): MET (7.1 months; P < .001) less than EGFR (11.2 months; P = .16) less than HER2 (16.9 months; P = .89) when compared with the negative group (16.2 months). Two of four patients with MET-amplified tumors treated with crizotinib experienced tumor shrinkage (-30% and -16%) and experienced progression after 3.7 and 3.5 months.

Long-term clinical outcome of intensity-modulated radiotherapy for inoperable non-small cell lung cancer: the MD Anderson experience.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2011-11-11,"In 2007, we published our initial experience in treating inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The current report is an update of that experience with long-term follow-up. Patients in this retrospective review were 165 patients who began definitive radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy, for newly diagnosed, pathologically confirmed NSCLC to a dose of ≥60 Gy from 2005 to 2006. Early and late toxicities assessed included treatment-related pneumonitis (TRP), pulmonary fibrosis, esophagitis, and esophageal stricture, scored mainly according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 3.0. Other variables monitored were radiation-associated dermatitis and changes in body weight and Karnofsky performance status. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compute survival and freedom from radiation-related acute and late toxicities as a function of time. Most patients (89%) had Stage III to IV disease. The median radiation dose was 66 Gy given in 33 fractions (range, 60-76 Gy, 1.8-2.3 Gy per fraction). Median overall survival time was 1.8 years; the 2-year and 3-year overall survival rates were 46% and 30%. Rates of Grade ≥3 maximum TRP (TRP(max)) were 11% at 6 months and 14% at 12 months. At 18 months, 86% of patients had developed Grade ≥1 maximum pulmonary fibrosis (pulmonary fibrosis(max)) and 7% Grade ≥2 pulmonary fibrosis(max). The median times to maximum esophagitis (esophagitis(max)) were 3 weeks (range, 1-13 weeks) for Grade 2 and 6 weeks (range, 3-13 weeks) for Grade 3. A higher percentage of patients who experienced Grade 3 esophagitis(max) later developed Grade 2 to 3 esophageal stricture. In our experience, using IMRT to treat NSCLC leads to low rates of pulmonary and esophageal toxicity, and favorable clinical outcomes in terms of survival.",Journal Article,2993.0,97.0,In 2007 we published our initial experience in treating inoperable non-small-cell cancer NSCLC with intensity-modulated radiation therapy IMRT The current report is an update of that experience with long-term follow-up Patients in this retrospective review were 165 patients who began definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy for newly diagnosed pathologically confirmed NSCLC to a dose of ≥60 Gy from 2005 to 2006 Early and late toxicities assessed included treatment-related pneumonitis TRP pulmonary fibrosis esophagitis and stricture scored mainly according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 3.0 Other variables monitored were radiation-associated dermatitis and changes in body weight and Karnofsky performance status The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compute survival and freedom from radiation-related acute and late toxicities as a function of time Most patients 89 had Stage III to IV disease The median radiation dose was 66 Gy given in 33 fractions range 60-76 Gy 1.8-2.3 Gy per fraction Median overall survival time was 1.8 years the 2-year and 3-year overall survival rates were 46 and 30 Rates of Grade ≥3 maximum TRP TRP max were 11 at 6 months and 14 at 12 months At 18 months 86 of patients had developed Grade ≥1 maximum pulmonary fibrosis pulmonary fibrosis max and 7 Grade ≥2 pulmonary fibrosis max The median times to maximum esophagitis esophagitis max were 3 weeks range 1-13 weeks for Grade 2 and 6 weeks range 3-13 weeks for Grade 3 A higher percentage of patients who experienced Grade 3 esophagitis max later developed Grade 2 to 3 stricture In our experience using IMRT to treat NSCLC leads to low rates of pulmonary and toxicity and favorable clinical outcomes in terms of survival,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[4, 1307, 21, 983, 114, 388, 730, 4, 1367, 3874, 220, 302, 31, 12, 304, 5, 837, 1757, 121, 36, 964, 3, 291, 414, 16, 35, 2991, 1, 17, 730, 5, 319, 337, 166, 126, 7, 4, 26, 459, 206, 11, 4966, 7, 54, 4603, 1057, 310, 5, 15, 187, 56, 9, 732, 265, 2998, 557, 304, 6, 8, 61, 1, 6690, 381, 29, 1242, 6, 1324, 191, 2, 807, 385, 275, 159, 24, 139, 2949, 7908, 1087, 3000, 5135, 2, 6673, 3179, 2615, 768, 6, 3, 186, 3462, 371, 9, 290, 281, 27, 13, 127, 682, 2909, 11, 121, 41, 5236, 2, 400, 4, 642, 924, 2, 2857, 528, 156, 3, 876, 882, 596, 10, 95, 6, 9577, 25, 2, 3060, 29, 121, 139, 286, 2, 807, 385, 22, 8, 343, 1, 98, 96, 7, 887, 42, 82, 316, 6, 478, 34, 3, 52, 121, 61, 10, 700, 381, 447, 4, 466, 1550, 184, 335, 846, 381, 14, 66, 18, 27, 381, 379, 1509, 52, 63, 25, 98, 10, 14, 66, 60, 3, 18, 111, 2, 27, 111, 63, 25, 151, 11, 641, 2, 201, 151, 1, 88, 2608, 689, 7908, 7908, 2649, 11, 175, 28, 49, 53, 2, 213, 28, 133, 53, 28, 203, 53, 868, 1, 7, 42, 276, 88, 3567, 689, 1087, 3000, 1087, 3000, 2649, 2, 67, 88, 3107, 1087, 3000, 2649, 3, 52, 1072, 6, 689, 5135, 5135, 2649, 11, 27, 244, 184, 14, 233, 244, 9, 88, 18, 2, 49, 244, 184, 27, 233, 244, 9, 88, 27, 8, 142, 1150, 1, 7, 54, 592, 88, 27, 5135, 2649, 1559, 276, 88, 18, 6, 27, 6673, 4, 114, 730, 75, 964, 6, 943, 304, 1940, 6, 154, 151, 1, 1087, 2, 155, 2, 913, 38, 123, 4, 1794, 1, 25]",1744.0,22079735,423
Diagnostic accuracy of EUS in differentiating mucosal versus submucosal invasion of superficial esophageal cancers: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Gastrointestinal endoscopy,Gastrointest. Endosc.,2011-11-23,"The prognosis of esophageal cancer (EC) depends on the depth of tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis. EC limited to the mucosa (T1a) can be treated effectively with minimally invasive endoscopic therapy, whereas submucosal (T1b) EC carries relatively high risk of lymph node metastasis and requires surgical resection. To determine the diagnostic accuracy of EUS in differentiating T1a EC from T1b EC. We performed a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Cochrane, and CINAHL Plus databases to identify studies in which results of EUS-based staging of EC were compared with the results of histopathology of EMR or surgically resected esophageal lesions. DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio, and a summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve was created. Meta-analysis of 19 international studies. Total of 1019 patients with superficial EC (SEC). EUS and EMR or surgical resection of SEC. Sensitivity and specificity of EUS in accurately staging SEC. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio of EUS for T1a staging were 0.85 (95% CI, 0.82-0.88), 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84-0.90), 6.62 (95% CI, 3.61-12.12), and 0.20 (95% CI, 0.14-0.30), respectively. For T1b staging, these results were 0.86 (95% CI, 0.82-0.89), 0.86 (95% CI, 0.83-0.89), 5.13 (95% CI, 3.36-7.82), and 0.17 (95% CI, 0.09-0.30), respectively. The area under the curve was at least 0.93 for both mucosal and submucosal lesions. Heterogeneity was present among the studies. Overall EUS has good accuracy (area under the curve ≥0.93) in staging SECs. Heterogeneity among the included studies suggests that multiple factors including the location and type of lesion, method and frequency of EUS probe, and the experience of the endosonographer can affect the diagnostic accuracy of EUS.",Journal Article,2981.0,107.0,The prognosis of cancer EC depends on the depth of tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis EC limited to the mucosa T1a can be treated effectively with minimally invasive endoscopic therapy whereas submucosal T1b EC carries relatively high risk of lymph node metastasis and requires surgical resection To determine the diagnostic accuracy of EUS in differentiating T1a EC from T1b EC We performed a comprehensive search of MEDLINE SCOPUS Cochrane and CINAHL Plus databases to identify studies in which results of EUS-based staging of EC were compared with the results of histopathology of EMR or surgically resected lesions DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled sensitivity specificity and likelihood ratio and a summary receiver operating characteristic SROC curve was created Meta-analysis of 19 international studies Total of 1019 patients with superficial EC SEC EUS and EMR or surgical resection of SEC Sensitivity and specificity of EUS in accurately staging SEC The pooled sensitivity specificity and positive and negative likelihood ratio of EUS for T1a staging were 0.85 95 CI 0.82-0.88 0.87 95 CI 0.84-0.90 6.62 95 CI 3.61-12.12 and 0.20 95 CI 0.14-0.30 respectively For T1b staging these results were 0.86 95 CI 0.82-0.89 0.86 95 CI 0.83-0.89 5.13 95 CI 3.36-7.82 and 0.17 95 CI 0.09-0.30 respectively The area under the curve was at least 0.93 for both mucosal and submucosal lesions Heterogeneity was present among the studies Overall EUS has good accuracy area under the curve ≥0.93 in staging SECs Heterogeneity among the included studies suggests that multiple factors including the location and type of lesion method and frequency of EUS probe and the experience of the endosonographer can affect the diagnostic accuracy of EUS,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[3, 356, 1, 12, 2180, 3828, 23, 3, 2436, 1, 30, 578, 2, 263, 289, 278, 2180, 383, 6, 3, 2713, 5710, 122, 40, 73, 1856, 5, 2144, 416, 2056, 36, 547, 9729, 6142, 2180, 4942, 1352, 64, 43, 1, 263, 289, 278, 2, 1706, 221, 170, 6, 223, 3, 752, 1190, 1, 3626, 4, 5209, 5710, 2180, 29, 6142, 2180, 21, 173, 8, 949, 1901, 1, 3388, 11347, 4956, 2, 14657, 349, 2348, 6, 255, 94, 4, 92, 99, 1, 3626, 90, 632, 1, 2180, 11, 72, 5, 3, 99, 1, 3831, 1, 7617, 15, 2350, 1133, 406, 26613, 26614, 2324, 176, 202, 10, 95, 6, 1191, 3, 1830, 485, 1121, 2, 1420, 197, 2, 8, 1962, 3185, 2584, 2037, 46163, 1496, 10, 2466, 1742, 65, 1, 326, 944, 94, 181, 1, 21118, 7, 5, 3562, 2180, 13678, 3626, 2, 7617, 15, 221, 170, 1, 13678, 485, 2, 1121, 1, 3626, 4, 2141, 632, 13678, 3, 1830, 485, 1121, 2, 109, 2, 199, 1420, 197, 1, 3626, 9, 5710, 632, 11, 13, 772, 48, 58, 13, 878, 13, 889, 13, 912, 48, 58, 13, 874, 13, 424, 49, 744, 48, 58, 27, 713, 133, 133, 2, 13, 179, 48, 58, 13, 213, 13, 201, 106, 9, 6142, 632, 46, 99, 11, 13, 868, 48, 58, 13, 878, 13, 887, 13, 868, 48, 58, 13, 852, 13, 887, 33, 233, 48, 58, 27, 511, 67, 878, 2, 13, 269, 48, 58, 13, 1730, 13, 201, 106, 3, 965, 669, 3, 1496, 10, 28, 506, 13, 966, 9, 110, 3068, 2, 9729, 406, 1144, 10, 364, 107, 3, 94, 63, 3626, 71, 1178, 1190, 965, 669, 3, 1496, 8898, 966, 4, 632, 60816, 1144, 107, 3, 159, 94, 844, 17, 232, 130, 141, 3, 1147, 2, 267, 1, 1180, 596, 2, 675, 1, 3626, 2888, 2, 3, 730, 1, 3, 46007, 122, 1158, 3, 752, 1190, 1, 3626]",1778.0,22115605,412
Self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) for patients with advanced esophageal cancer in Malawi: an effective palliative treatment.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2011-12-12,"Esophageal cancer is common in Malawi and most patients are inoperable at time of diagnosis. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate palliative treatment with self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) in Malawi, a low-income country with limited medical resources. Data of patients with advanced inoperable esophageal cancer were prospectively collected. Tumor and patient specifics, risk factors, dysphagia scores, complications, and survival were assessed. Follow-up data for 1 year or until death were collected from 118/143 patients (83%) during clinic visits, home visits, or via cell phone. One hundred forty-three patients were treated with 154 SEMS. Median survival was 210 days (95% CI: 150-262 days). Fourteen of 118 patients with complete follow-up (11.9%) survived more than 1 year with longest documented survival of 406 days.

Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery for esophageal adenocarcinoma: significance of microscopically positive circumferential radial margins.,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg.,2011-12-14,"The incidence and consequence of an isolated involved circumferential radial margin (CRM) after resection for esophageal adenocarcinoma in the setting of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) has not been reported. We aimed to determine the frequency and significance of a close (<1 mm) or involved CRM in patients undergoing esophagectomy after CRT. We retrospectively analyzed the data from patients undergoing resection from 1997 to 2008 for esophageal adenocarcinoma after neoadjuvant CRT. A positive CRM was defined as microscopic tumor at or less than 1 mm of the radial margin. An R1 resection was tumor at the radial margin. Only patients with ypT3 or greater tumors were included. R2 resections were excluded. Statistical comparisons were performed using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses. A total of 160 patients met the inclusion criteria, 42 (26%) had a positive CRM. The median survival did not significantly differ between the CRM-negative and -positive groups (28 vs 50 months, P = .84). A propensity score matching analysis also failed to find a significant difference in outcomes. When analyzed by tumor present at the margin (R1), R0 patients had a longer median survival compared with R1 patients (28 vs 8 months, P = .01). This difference, however, was not seen on propensity score matching.

Association of Aurora-A (STK15) kinase polymorphisms with clinical outcome of esophageal cancer treated with preoperative chemoradiation.,Cancer,Cancer,2011-12-27,"Aurora-A/STK15 is a serine/threonine kinase critical for regulated chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. We investigated the association between 2 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding region of STK15, T91A (Phe31Ile) and G169A (Val57Ile), and clinical outcome of esophageal cancer treated with preoperative chemoradiation. Genotypes at Phe31Ile and Val57Ile were assessed from peripheral blood lymphocytes of 190 esophageal cancer patients and were correlated to response to treatment, recurrence rate, risk of death, disease-free survival (DFS) and median survival time (MTS). All patients had resectable esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer and received preoperative chemoradiation followed by esophagectomy. The heterozygous variant Phe31/Ile variant was significantly associated with tumor recurrence (odds ratio [OR] = 4.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.12-8.94; P < .001), shorter DFS (P = .0001), and shorter MTS (P = .012). For patients receiving cisplatin-based therapy, only the variant Phe31/Ile had an adverse effect on response (OR = 2.8; 95% CI, 1.01-5.17; P = .048) and MTS (P = .026). The variant 91A-169G haplotype carried a significant risk for lack of complete response (OR = 2.54; 95% CI, 1.15-5.54) and higher rate of recurrence (OR = 2.73; 95%CI, 1.00-7.29). The presence of at least 1 variant allele at each locus further increased the risk of recurrence (adjusted OR = 6.21; 95% CI, 2.28-17.11; P = <.001), and was associated significantly shorter DFS (P = .003). Our study shows that functional SNPs in the STK15 gene are associated with higher rate of recurrence, higher likelihood of chemoratiotherapy-resistance, shorter DFS, and shorter MTS.

Biomarkers Prev.,2012-01-11,"Mesothelin is overexpressed in several malignancies and is purportedly a specific marker of malignant transformation. In this pilot study, we investigated whether tissue and serum mesothelin are potential markers of neoplastic progression in Barrett's esophagus (BE) and in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Mesothelin expression was retrospectively evaluated in normal, BE, and EAC tissue from surgically resected esophageal specimens (n = 125). In addition, soluble mesothelin-related peptide (SMRP) levels were measured in serum. Normal esophageal mucosa did not express mesothelin. BE tissue with high-grade dysplasia specifically expressed mesothelin, whereas BE tissue with low-grade or without dysplasia did not. Fifty-seven (46%) EAC tumors were positive for mesothelin. EAC tumors with BE expressed mesothelin more often than those without BE (58% vs. 35%, P = 0.01). SMRP levels were elevated in 70% of EAC patients (mean = 0.89 nmol/L; range: 0.03-3.77 nmol/L), but not in patients with acid reflux and/or BE. Mesothelin is commonly expressed in BE-associated EAC. On the basis of this pilot study, a prospective study is under way to evaluate tissue and serum mesothelin which are potential markers of neoplastic progression in BE and in EAC (NCT01393483).

Association of HER2/ErbB2 expression and gene amplification with pathologic features and prognosis in esophageal adenocarcinomas.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2012-01-01,"We examined the frequency, tumor characteristics, and prognostic impact of HER2 protein expression and gene amplification in patients with curatively resected esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). HER2 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in surgical EAC specimens (n = 713). Gene amplification was examined by FISH in a large subset (n = 344). Most tumors were T3-4 (66%) or node positive (72%); 95% were located in the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction. No patient received neoadjuvant therapy. Cox models were used. Overall, 17% of EACs were HER2 positive (i.e., IHC3(+) or IHC2(+) with amplification), with strong agreement between HER2 amplification (HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥2) and expression (κ = 0.83). HER2 positivity was significantly associated with lower tumor grade, less invasiveness, fewer malignant nodes, and the presence of adjacent Barrett's esophagus (BE).

Genotypic variants at 2q33 and risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in China: a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies.,Human molecular genetics,Hum. Mol. Genet.,2012-02-08,"Genome-wide association studies have identified susceptibility loci for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We conducted a meta-analysis of all single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that showed nominally significant P-values in two previously published genome-wide scans that included a total of 2961 ESCC cases and 3400 controls. The meta-analysis revealed five SNPs at 2q33 with P< 5 × 10(-8), and the strongest signal was rs13016963, with a combined odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 1.29 (1.19-1.40) and P= 7.63 × 10(-10). An imputation analysis of 4304 SNPs at 2q33 suggested a single association signal, and the strongest imputed SNP associations were similar to those from the genotyped SNPs. We conducted an ancestral recombination graph analysis with 53 SNPs to identify one or more haplotypes that harbor the variants directly responsible for the detected association signal. This showed that the five SNPs exist in a single haplotype along with 45 imputed SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium, and the strongest candidate was rs10201587, one of the genotyped SNPs. Our meta-analysis found genome-wide significant SNPs at 2q33 that map to the CASP8/ALS2CR12/TRAK2 gene region.

Activation of GATA binding protein 6 (GATA6) sustains oncogenic lineage-survival in esophageal adenocarcinoma.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2012-02-28,"Gene amplification is a tumor-specific event during malignant transformation. Recent studies have proposed a lineage-dependency (addiction) model of human cancer whereby amplification of certain lineage transcription factors predisposes a survival mechanism in tumor cells. These tumor cells are derived from tissues where the lineage factors play essential developmental and maintenance roles. Here, we show that recurrent amplification at 18q11.2 occurs in 21% of esophageal adenocarcinomas (EAC). Utilization of an integrative genomic strategy reveals a single gene, the embryonic endoderm transcription factor GATA6, as the selected target of the amplification. Overexpression of GATA6 is found in EACs that contain gene amplification. We find that EAC patients whose tumors carry GATA6 amplification have a poorer survival. We show that ectopic expression of GATA6, together with FGFR2 isoform IIIb, increases anchorage-independent growth in immortalized Barrett's esophageal cells. Conversely, siRNA-mediated silencing of GATA6 significantly reduces both cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in EAC cells.

Body mass index and survival in esophageal adenocarcinoma treated with chemoradiotherapy followed by esophagectomy.,Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,J. Gastrointest. Surg.,2012-03-08,"Body mass index (BMI) has been linked with inferior outcomes in gastrointestinal malignancies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of BMI on survival in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma. Medical records were analyzed for patients who underwent esophagectomy after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) for adenocarcinoma from 2000 to the present. Patients were grouped into BMI ≤ 25, >25-30, >30-35, and BMI >35. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis (MVA) was performed using Cox proportional hazard regression model. We identified 303 patients for the analysis. The only difference in patient characteristics between groups was gender. We found no difference in OS and DFS associated with BMI (p=0.3297 for OS; p=0.5950 for DFS). There were no differences in postoperative complications or mortality between BMI groups. MVA revealed that higher stage and less than a complete response to nCRT were prognostic for worse OS and DFS, while age, gender, type of surgery, year of diagnosis, and BMI were not prognostic. BMI was neither associated with surgical complications nor survival in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma treated with nCRT.

Proton beam therapy and concurrent chemotherapy for esophageal cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-03-13,"Proton beam therapy (PBT) is a promising modality for the management of thoracic malignancies. We report our preliminary experience of treating esophageal cancer patients with concurrent chemotherapy (CChT) and PBT (CChT/PBT) at MD Anderson Cancer Center. This is an analysis of 62 esophageal cancer patients enrolled on a prospective study evaluating normal tissue toxicity from CChT/PBT from 2006 to 2010. Patients were treated with passive scattering PBT with two- or three-field beam arrangement using 180 to 250 MV protons. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to assess time-to-event outcomes and compared the distributions between groups using the log-rank test. The median follow-up time was 20.1 months for survivors. The median age was 68 years (range, 38-86). Most patients were males (82%) who had adenocarcinomas (76%) and Stage II-III disease (84%). The median radiation dose was 50.4 Gy (RBE [relative biologic equivalence]) (range, 36-57.6). The most common grade 2 to 3 acute toxicities from CChT/PBT were esophagitis (46.8%), fatigue (43.6%), nausea (33.9%), anorexia (30.1%), and radiation dermatitis (16.1%). There were two cases of grade 2 and 3 radiation pneumonitis and two cases of grade 5 toxicities. A total of 29 patients (46.8%) received preoperative CChT/PBT, with one postoperative death. The pathologic complete response (pCR) rate for the surgical cohort was 28%, and the pCR and near CR rates (0%-1% residual cells) were 50%. While there were significantly fewer local-regional recurrences in the preoperative group (3/29) than in the definitive CChT/PBT group (16/33) (log-rank test, p = 0.005), there were no differences in distant metastatic (DM)-free interval or overall survival (OS) between the two groups. This is the first report of patients treated with PBT/CChT for esophageal cancer. Our data suggest that this modality is associated with a few severe toxicities, but the pathologic response and clinical outcomes are encouraging.

Celiac node failure patterns after definitive chemoradiation for esophageal cancer in the modern era.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-03-19,"The celiac lymph node axis acts as a gateway for metastatic systemic spread. The need for prophylactic celiac nodal coverage in chemoradiation therapy for esophageal cancer is controversial. Given the improved ability to evaluate lymph node status before treatment via positron emission tomography (PET) and endoscopic ultrasound, we hypothesized that prophylactic celiac node irradiation may not be needed for patients with localized esophageal carcinoma. We reviewed the radiation treatment volumes for 131 patients who underwent definitive chemoradiation for esophageal cancer. Patients with celiac lymph node involvement at baseline were excluded. Median radiation dose was 50.4 Gy. The location of all celiac node failures was compared with the radiation treatment plan to determine whether the failures occurred within or outside the radiation treatment field. At a median follow-up time of 52.6 months (95% CI 46.1-56.7 months), 6 of 60 patients (10%) without celiac node coverage had celiac nodal failure; in 5 of these patients, the failures represented the first site of recurrence. Of the 71 patients who had celiac coverage, only 5 patients (7%) had celiac region relapse. In multivariate analyses, having a pretreatment-to-post-treatment change in standardized uptake value on PET >52% (odds ratio [OR] 0.198, p = 0.0327) and having failure in the clinical target volume (OR 10.72, p = 0.001) were associated with risk of celiac region relapse.

"Cetuximab plus cisplatin, irinotecan, and thoracic radiotherapy as definitive treatment for locally advanced, unresectable esophageal cancer: a phase-II study of the SWOG (S0414).",Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2012-05-01,"The specific aims of the study were to evaluate the 2-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity profile, and best objective response rate in patients with locally advanced, clinically unresectable esophageal cancer receiving cetuximab, cisplatin, irinotecan, and thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) within a multi-institutional cooperative-group setting. Eligible patients (cT4 M0 or medically unresectable, biopsy proven, and noncervical esophageal cancer) were to receive four 21-day cycles of cetuximab 400 mg/m (day 1, cycle 1), cetuximab 250 mg/m (day 8, 15, cycle 1; then days 1, 8, and 15 for subsequent cycles), cisplatin 30 mg/m (days 1 and 8, all cycles), and irinotecan 65 mg/m (days 1 and 8, all cycles). TRT was administered at 1.8 Gy in 28 daily fractions to a total dose of 50.4 Gy, to begin with on day 1 of cycle 3. The primary endpoint was 2-year OS, with an accrual goal of 75 patients with adenocarcinoma. The study was closed because of slow accrual, with 21 eligible patients (11 squamous, 10 adenocarcinoma) enrolled from May 2005 to September 2007. Two-year OS and PFS (95% confidence interval [CI]) were 33.3% (14.6-57.0%) and 23.8% (8.2-47.2%), respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimates of median (95% CI) OS and PFS were 11.2 (6.4-43.6) and 6.4 (3.7-12.0) months, respectively. The overall response rate (95% CI) among 17 evaluable patients was 17.6% (3.8-43.4%), including 6% confirmed complete responders and 12% unconfirmed partial responders. Two deaths resulted from protocol treatment (sudden death and gastrointestinal necrosis). Ten (47.6%) and 6 (28.6%) patients had grade-3 or -4 toxicity, respectively: 52.4% were hematologic, 23.8% had fatigue, 19.0% had nausea, 19.0% had dehydration, and 19.0% had anorexia. Concomitant cetuximab, cisplatin, irinotecan, and TRT were poorly tolerated in the first North American cooperative group trial testing this regimen for locally advanced esophageal cancer as treatment-related mortality approached 10%. Single-institution phase-II cetuximab-based combined modality trials have yielded encouraging results in preliminary analyses. The SWOG GI Committee endorses enrollment to open clinical trials to clarify the therapeutic ratio of cetuximab-based combined modality approaches for esophageal cancer.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",2821.0,,The specific aims of the study were to evaluate the 2-year overall survival OS and progression-free survival PFS toxicity profile and best objective response rate in patients with locally advanced clinically unresectable cancer receiving cetuximab cisplatin irinotecan and thoracic radiotherapy TRT within a multi-institutional cooperative-group setting Eligible patients cT4 M0 or medically unresectable biopsy proven and noncervical cancer were to receive four 21-day cycles of cetuximab 400 mg/m day 1 cycle 1 cetuximab 250 mg/m day 8 15 cycle 1 then days 1 8 and 15 for subsequent cycles cisplatin 30 mg/m days 1 and 8 all cycles and irinotecan 65 mg/m days 1 and 8 all cycles TRT was administered at 1.8 Gy in 28 daily fractions to a total dose of 50.4 Gy to begin with on day 1 of cycle 3 The primary endpoint was 2-year OS with an accrual goal of 75 patients with adenocarcinoma The study was closed because of slow accrual with 21 eligible patients 11 squamous 10 adenocarcinoma enrolled from May 2005 to September 2007 Two-year OS and PFS 95 confidence interval CI were 33.3 14.6-57.0 and 23.8 8.2-47.2 respectively Kaplan-Meier estimates of median 95 CI OS and PFS were 11.2 6.4-43.6 and 6.4 3.7-12.0 months respectively The overall response rate 95 CI among 17 evaluable patients was 17.6 3.8-43.4 including 6 confirmed complete responders and 12 unconfirmed partial responders Two deaths resulted from protocol treatment sudden death and necrosis Ten 47.6 and 6 28.6 patients had grade-3 or -4 toxicity respectively 52.4 were hematologic 23.8 had fatigue 19.0 had nausea 19.0 had dehydration and 19.0 had anorexia Concomitant cetuximab cisplatin irinotecan and TRT were poorly tolerated in the first North American cooperative group trial testing this regimen for locally advanced cancer as treatment-related mortality approached 10 Single-institution phase-II cetuximab-based combined modality trials have yielded encouraging results in preliminary analyses The SWOG GI Committee endorses enrollment to open clinical trials to clarify the therapeutic ratio of cetuximab-based combined modality approaches for cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[3, 112, 2970, 1, 3, 45, 11, 6, 376, 3, 18, 111, 63, 25, 118, 2, 91, 115, 25, 300, 155, 800, 2, 824, 461, 51, 116, 4, 7, 5, 795, 131, 505, 1468, 12, 357, 1175, 540, 1071, 2, 2098, 310, 7778, 262, 8, 1414, 1115, 1690, 87, 546, 625, 7, 23976, 4591, 15, 4381, 1468, 411, 1930, 2, 47157, 12, 11, 6, 560, 294, 239, 218, 410, 1, 1175, 1524, 81, 188, 218, 14, 417, 14, 1175, 2039, 81, 188, 218, 66, 167, 417, 14, 818, 162, 14, 66, 2, 167, 9, 706, 410, 540, 201, 81, 188, 162, 14, 2, 66, 62, 410, 2, 1071, 556, 81, 188, 162, 14, 2, 66, 62, 410, 7778, 10, 468, 28, 14, 66, 381, 4, 339, 391, 1550, 6, 8, 181, 61, 1, 212, 39, 381, 6, 6886, 5, 23, 218, 14, 1, 417, 27, 3, 86, 1138, 10, 18, 111, 118, 5, 35, 2262, 1326, 1, 481, 7, 5, 449, 3, 45, 10, 3745, 408, 1, 3645, 2262, 5, 239, 625, 7, 175, 691, 79, 449, 346, 29, 68, 1242, 6, 2636, 1307, 100, 111, 118, 2, 300, 48, 307, 268, 58, 11, 466, 27, 213, 49, 696, 13, 2, 382, 66, 66, 18, 662, 18, 106, 876, 882, 1423, 1, 52, 48, 58, 118, 2, 300, 11, 175, 18, 49, 39, 601, 49, 2, 49, 39, 27, 67, 133, 13, 53, 106, 3, 63, 51, 116, 48, 58, 107, 269, 859, 7, 10, 269, 49, 27, 66, 601, 39, 141, 49, 557, 236, 1983, 2, 133, 5971, 450, 1983, 100, 1043, 627, 29, 1182, 24, 10643, 273, 2, 1523, 1618, 662, 49, 2, 49, 339, 49, 7, 42, 88, 27, 15, 39, 155, 106, 653, 39, 11, 813, 382, 66, 42, 613, 326, 13, 42, 1218, 326, 13, 42, 5414, 2, 326, 13, 42, 3373, 1781, 1175, 540, 1071, 2, 7778, 11, 1240, 421, 4, 3, 157, 2669, 597, 1690, 87, 160, 471, 26, 477, 9, 795, 131, 12, 22, 24, 139, 282, 5738, 79, 226, 731, 124, 215, 1175, 90, 397, 1396, 143, 47, 2178, 2269, 99, 4, 1676, 318, 3, 5462, 2104, 2002, 23836, 1798, 6, 1020, 38, 143, 6, 3968, 3, 189, 197, 1, 1175, 90, 397, 1396, 611, 9, 12]",2128.0,22481235,298

Res.,2012-03-30,"Surgery is the cornerstone of potentially curative therapy for upper gastrointestinal cancer. We analyzed the patterns of treatment regarding the use of surgery for early-stage upper gastrointestinal cancer in the United States. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Research database was used to identify patients with cancer of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, liver, gallbladder, biliary tract, or duodenum (2004-2007). Only patients with potentially resectable stage I and II disease were selected. The primary outcome measure was the use of curative intent surgery. The secondary outcomes were the predictors of surgery. We identified 29,249 patients with a median age of 69 years. Only 54% of the patients underwent cancer-directed surgical resection, ranging from 28% for liver cancer to 89% for gallbladder cancer. The remaining patients underwent either local excision (8%) or no surgery (38%). Among the no surgery group, most patients (79%) were documented as ""not being recommended for resection."" The independent variables on multivariate analysis predictive of a nonoperative approach included black race, age older than 75 years, tumor size greater than 5 cm, and high poverty level (P < 0.001).

Phase I evaluation of TNFerade biologic plus chemoradiotherapy before esophagectomy for locally advanced resectable esophageal cancer.,Gastrointestinal endoscopy,Gastrointest. Endosc.,2012-04-18,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery is the primary treatment option for patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. This multicenter phase I trial examined intratumoral injection of TNFerade biologic, an adenoviral vector that expresses the human tumor necrosis factor-α gene, with chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced esophageal cancer. To assess pathologic complete response (pCR), time to disease progression, progression-free survival, survival, and safety and tolerance in patients treated with preoperative chemoradiation combined with endoscopy or EUS-guided intratumoral injection of TNFerade biologic. Five weekly injections of TNFerade biologic, dose-escalated logarithmically from 4 × 10(8) to 4 × 10(11) particle units (PU), were given in combination with cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) and intravenous 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m(2)/d for 96 hours on days 1 and 29, and concurrent radiation therapy to 45 Gy. Surgery was performed 9 to 15 weeks after treatment. U.S. multicenter study. Patients with stage II and III esophageal cancer were enrolled. Primary outcome measures were safety, feasibility, tolerability, and rate of pCR. Secondary outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival. Twenty-four patients with a median age of 61 years were enrolled; 88% of the patients were men, 21% were stage II, and 79% were stage III. Six (29%) had a pCR, observed among 21 patients (20 who underwent esophagectomy and 1 at autopsy). Dose-limiting toxicities were not observed. The most frequent potentially related adverse events were fatigue (54%), fever (38%), nausea (29%), vomiting (21%), esophagitis (21%), and chills (21%). At the top dose of 4 × 10(11) PU, thromboembolic events developed in 5 of 8 patients. The median OS was 47.8 months.

Adaptive/nonadaptive proton radiation planning and outcomes in a phase II trial for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-04-27,"To analyze dosimetric variables and outcomes after adaptive replanning of radiation therapy during concurrent high-dose protons and chemotherapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nine of 44 patients with stage III NSCLC in a prospective phase II trial of concurrent paclitaxel/carboplatin with proton radiation [74 Gy(RBE) in 37 fractions] had modifications to their original treatment plans after re-evaluation revealed changes that would compromise coverage of the target volume or violate dose constraints; plans for the other 35 patients were not changed. We compared patients with adaptive plans with those with nonadaptive plans in terms of dosimetry and outcomes. At a median follow-up of 21.2 months (median overall survival, 29.6 months), no differences were found in local, regional, or distant failure or overall survival between groups. Adaptive planning was used more often for large tumors that shrank to a greater extent (median, 107.1 cm(3) adaptive and 86.4 cm(3) nonadaptive; median changes in volume, 25.3% adaptive and 1.2% nonadaptive; P<.01). The median number of fractions delivered using adaptive planning was 13 (range, 4-22). Adaptive planning generally improved sparing of the esophagus (median absolute decrease in V(70), 1.8%; range, 0%-22.9%) and spinal cord (median absolute change in maximum dose, 3.7 Gy; range, 0-13.8 Gy). Without adaptive replanning, target coverage would have been compromised in 2 cases (57% and 82% coverage without adaptation vs 100% for both with adaptation); neither patient experienced local failure. Radiation-related grade 3 toxicity rates were similar between groups. Adaptive planning can reduce normal tissue doses and prevent target misses, particularly for patients with large tumors that shrink substantially during therapy. Adaptive plans seem to have acceptable toxicity and achieve similar local, regional, and distant control and overall survival, even in patients with larger tumors, vs nonadaptive plans.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",2825.0,45.0,To analyze dosimetric variables and outcomes after adaptive replanning of radiation therapy during concurrent high-dose protons and chemotherapy for locally advanced cell cancer NSCLC Nine of 44 patients with stage III NSCLC in a prospective phase II trial of concurrent paclitaxel/carboplatin with proton radiation 74 Gy RBE in 37 fractions had modifications to their original treatment plans after re-evaluation revealed changes that would compromise coverage of the target volume or violate dose constraints plans for the other 35 patients were not changed We compared patients with adaptive plans with those with nonadaptive plans in terms of dosimetry and outcomes At a median follow-up of 21.2 months median overall survival 29.6 months no differences were found in local regional or distant failure or overall survival between groups Adaptive planning was used more often for large tumors that shrank to a greater extent median 107.1 cm 3 adaptive and 86.4 cm 3 nonadaptive median changes in volume 25.3 adaptive and 1.2 nonadaptive P .01 The median number of fractions delivered using adaptive planning was 13 range 4-22 Adaptive planning generally improved sparing of the median absolute decrease in V 70 1.8 range 0 -22.9 and spinal cord median absolute change in maximum dose 3.7 Gy range 0-13.8 Gy Without adaptive replanning target coverage would have been compromised in 2 cases 57 and 82 coverage without adaptation vs 100 for both with adaptation neither patient experienced local failure Radiation-related grade 3 toxicity rates were similar between groups Adaptive planning can reduce normal tissue doses and prevent target misses particularly for patients with large tumors that shrink substantially during therapy Adaptive plans seem to have acceptable toxicity and achieve similar local regional and distant control and overall survival even in patients with larger tumors vs nonadaptive plans,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[6, 1992, 3187, 682, 2, 123, 50, 2454, 16916, 1, 121, 36, 190, 750, 64, 61, 6684, 2, 56, 9, 795, 131, 31, 12, 304, 762, 1, 584, 7, 5, 82, 316, 304, 4, 8, 482, 124, 215, 160, 1, 750, 490, 927, 5, 2095, 121, 794, 381, 7037, 4, 567, 1550, 42, 2916, 6, 136, 2279, 24, 1853, 50, 1491, 451, 553, 400, 17, 688, 4665, 2139, 1, 3, 283, 433, 15, 61394, 61, 4879, 1853, 9, 3, 127, 465, 7, 11, 44, 2368, 21, 72, 7, 5, 2454, 1853, 5, 135, 5, 35354, 1853, 4, 1794, 1, 4113, 2, 123, 28, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 239, 18, 53, 52, 63, 25, 462, 49, 53, 77, 362, 11, 204, 4, 293, 951, 15, 626, 496, 15, 63, 25, 59, 271, 2454, 1349, 10, 95, 80, 629, 9, 375, 57, 17, 39976, 6, 8, 378, 1039, 52, 3650, 14, 494, 27, 2454, 2, 868, 39, 494, 27, 35354, 52, 400, 4, 433, 243, 27, 2454, 2, 14, 18, 35354, 19, 355, 3, 52, 207, 1, 1550, 1623, 75, 2454, 1349, 10, 233, 184, 39, 350, 2454, 1349, 1228, 231, 1851, 1, 3, 52, 1766, 775, 4, 603, 431, 14, 66, 184, 13, 350, 83, 2, 1499, 1885, 52, 1766, 707, 4, 689, 61, 27, 67, 381, 184, 13, 233, 66, 381, 187, 2454, 16916, 283, 2139, 688, 47, 85, 4867, 4, 18, 140, 696, 2, 878, 2139, 187, 7275, 105, 394, 9, 110, 5, 7275, 2174, 69, 592, 293, 496, 121, 139, 88, 27, 155, 151, 11, 288, 59, 271, 2454, 1349, 122, 969, 295, 246, 415, 2, 1682, 283, 21940, 823, 9, 7, 5, 375, 57, 17, 22572, 2109, 190, 36, 2454, 1853, 3233, 6, 47, 1595, 155, 2, 1359, 288, 293, 951, 2, 626, 182, 2, 63, 25, 871, 4, 7, 5, 1077, 57, 105, 35354, 1853]",1914.0,22543217,0

The appropriate management of these patients is contentious and no single standard of care has been defined. Literature suggests that preoperative chemoradiotherapy may be superior to preoperative chemotherapy. Recently, several developments have impacted the care of these patients. The 2010 AJCC TNM staging system now recognizes the biologic heterogeneity of the disease and stages adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma separately. Studies suggest potentially less toxic chemotherapeutic agents including oxaliplatin may be useful in the management of this disease. FDG-PET imaging appears to have prognostic value and may predict for pathologic response. In addition, several trials have explored inhibition of the ErbB1 (EGFR) and ErbB2 (Her2) receptors.

Failure patterns in patients with esophageal cancer treated with definitive chemoradiation.,Cancer,Cancer,2011-10-05,"Local failure after definitive chemoradiation therapy for unresectable esophageal cancer remains problematic. Little is known about the failure pattern based on modern-day radiation treatment volumes. We hypothesized that most local failures would be within the gross tumor volume (GTV), where the bulk of the tumor burden resides. We reviewed treatment volumes for 239 patients who underwent definitive chemoradiation therapy and compared this information with failure patterns on follow-up positron emission tomography (PET). Failures were categorized as within the GTV, the larger clinical target volume (CTV, which encompasses microscopic disease), or the still larger planning target volume (PTV, which encompasses setup variability) or outside the radiation field. At a median follow-up time of 52.6 months (95% confidence interval, 46.1-56.7 months), 119 patients (50%) had experienced local failure, 114 (48%) had distant failure, and 74 (31%) had no evidence of failure. Of all local failures, 107 (90%) were within the GTV, 27 (23%) were within the CTV, and 14 (12%) were within in the PTV.

"Esophageal toxicity from high-dose, single-fraction paraspinal stereotactic radiosurgery.","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-05-07,"To report the esophageal toxicity from single-fraction paraspinal stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and identify dosimetric and clinical risk factors for toxicity. A total of 204 spinal metastases abutting the esophagus (182 patients) were treated with high-dose single-fraction SRS during 2003-2010. Toxicity was scored using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Dose-volume histograms were combined to generate a comprehensive atlas of complication incidence that identifies risk factors for toxicity. Correlation of dose-volume factors with esophageal toxicity was assessed using Fisher's exact test and logistic regression. Clinical factors were correlated with toxicity. The median dose to the planning treatment volume was 24 Gy. Median follow-up was 12 months (range, 3-81). There were 31 (15%) acute and 24 (12%) late esophageal toxicities. The rate of grade ≥3 acute or late toxicity was 6.8% (14 patients). Fisher's exact test resulted in significant median splits for grade ≥3 toxicity at V12 = 3.78 cm(3) (relative risk [RR] 3.7, P=.05), V15 = 1.87 cm(3) (RR 13, P=.0013), V20 = 0.11 cm(3) (RR 6, P=0.01), and V22 = 0.0 cm(3) (RR 13, P=.0013). The median split for D2.5 cm(3) (14.02 Gy) was also a significant predictor of toxicity (RR 6; P=.01). A highly significant logistic regression model was generated on the basis of D2.5 cm(3). One hundred percent (n = 7) of grade ≥4 toxicities were associated with radiation recall reactions after doxorubicin or gemcitabine chemotherapy or iatrogenic manipulation of the irradiated esophagus. High-dose, single-fraction paraspinal SRS has a low rate of grade ≥3 esophageal toxicity. Severe esophageal toxicity is minimized with careful attention to esophageal doses during treatment planning. Iatrogenic manipulation of the irradiated esophagus and systemic agents classically associated with radiation recall reactions are associated with development of grade ≥4 toxicity.",Journal Article,2815.0,63.0,To report the toxicity from single-fraction paraspinal stereotactic radiosurgery SRS and identify dosimetric and clinical risk factors for toxicity A total of 204 spinal metastases abutting the 182 patients were treated with high-dose single-fraction SRS during 2003-2010 Toxicity was scored using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 Dose-volume histograms were combined to generate a comprehensive atlas of complication incidence that identifies risk factors for toxicity Correlation of dose-volume factors with toxicity was assessed using Fisher 's exact test and logistic regression Clinical factors were correlated with toxicity The median dose to the planning treatment volume was 24 Gy Median follow-up was 12 months range 3-81 There were 31 15 acute and 24 12 late toxicities The rate of grade ≥3 acute or late toxicity was 6.8 14 patients Fisher 's exact test resulted in significant median splits for grade ≥3 toxicity at V12 3.78 cm 3 relative risk RR 3.7 P=.05 V15 1.87 cm 3 RR 13 P=.0013 V20 0.11 cm 3 RR 6 P=0.01 and V22 0.0 cm 3 RR 13 P=.0013 The median split for D2.5 cm 3 14.02 Gy was also a significant predictor of toxicity RR 6 P=.01 A highly significant logistic regression model was generated on the basis of D2.5 cm 3 One hundred percent n 7 of grade ≥4 toxicities were associated with radiation recall reactions after doxorubicin or gemcitabine chemotherapy or iatrogenic manipulation of the irradiated High-dose single-fraction paraspinal SRS has a low rate of grade ≥3 toxicity Severe toxicity is minimized with careful attention to doses during treatment planning Iatrogenic manipulation of the irradiated and systemic agents classically associated with radiation recall reactions are associated with development of grade ≥4 toxicity,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[6, 414, 3, 155, 29, 226, 1509, 9282, 1729, 2192, 1429, 2, 255, 3187, 2, 38, 43, 130, 9, 155, 8, 181, 1, 5996, 1499, 196, 13245, 3, 5160, 7, 11, 73, 5, 64, 61, 226, 1509, 1429, 190, 1522, 1120, 155, 10, 3179, 75, 3, 657, 12, 1377, 186, 155, 371, 9, 290, 281, 2256, 39, 13, 61, 433, 8638, 11, 397, 6, 2562, 8, 949, 2643, 1, 1447, 287, 17, 2953, 43, 130, 9, 155, 816, 1, 61, 433, 130, 5, 155, 10, 275, 75, 3135, 292, 2472, 412, 2, 812, 320, 38, 130, 11, 438, 5, 155, 3, 52, 61, 6, 3, 1349, 24, 433, 10, 259, 381, 52, 166, 126, 10, 133, 53, 184, 27, 865, 125, 11, 456, 167, 286, 2, 259, 133, 807, 385, 3, 116, 1, 88, 2608, 286, 15, 807, 155, 10, 49, 66, 213, 7, 3135, 292, 2472, 412, 627, 4, 93, 52, 31152, 9, 88, 2608, 155, 28, 12166, 27, 833, 494, 27, 580, 43, 861, 27, 67, 19, 474, 18318, 14, 912, 494, 27, 861, 233, 19, 11534, 8120, 13, 175, 494, 27, 861, 49, 19, 13, 355, 2, 61430, 13, 13, 494, 27, 861, 233, 19, 11534, 3, 52, 6240, 9, 4171, 33, 494, 27, 213, 588, 381, 10, 120, 8, 93, 980, 1, 155, 861, 49, 19, 355, 8, 561, 93, 812, 320, 202, 10, 1419, 23, 3, 877, 1, 4171, 33, 494, 27, 104, 1128, 714, 78, 67, 1, 88, 5915, 385, 11, 41, 5, 121, 6169, 2428, 50, 856, 15, 679, 56, 15, 16401, 6239, 1, 3, 2398, 64, 61, 226, 1509, 9282, 1429, 71, 8, 154, 116, 1, 88, 2608, 155, 905, 155, 16, 9243, 5, 3465, 2111, 6, 415, 190, 24, 1349, 16401, 6239, 1, 3, 2398, 2, 403, 183, 9260, 41, 5, 121, 6169, 2428, 32, 41, 5, 193, 1, 88, 5915, 155]",1809.0,22572079,170
Influence of sex on the survival of patients with esophageal cancer.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2012-05-14,"The prognostic value of sex for esophageal cancer survival is currently unclear, and growing data suggest that hormonal influences may account for incidence disparities between men and women. Therefore, moving from the hypothesis that hormones could affect the prognosis of patients with esophageal cancer, we investigated the primary hypothesis that sex is associated with survival and the secondary hypotheses that the relationship between sex and survival depends, at least in part, on age, histology, and race/ethnicity. By using the SEER databases from 1973 to 2007, we identified 13,603 patients (34%) with metastatic esophageal cancer (MEC) and 26,848 patients (66%) with locoregional esophageal cancer (LEC). Cox proportional hazards model for competing risks were used for analyses. In the multivariate analysis, women had longer esophageal cancer-specific survival (ECSS) than men in both MEC (hazard ratio [HR], 0.949; 95% CI, 0.905 to 0.995; P = .029) and LEC (HR, 0.920; 95% CI, 0.886 to 0.955; P < .001) cohorts. When age and histology were accounted for, there was no difference for ECSS between men and women with adenocarcinoma. In contrast, women younger than age 55 years (HR, 0.896; 95% CI, 0.792 to 1.014; P = .081) and those age 55 years or older (HR, 0.905; 95% CI, 0.862 to 0.950; P < .001) with squamous cell LEC had longer ECSS than men. In the squamous cell MEC cohort, only women younger than age 55 years had longer ECSS (HR, 0.823; 95% CI, 0.708 to 0.957; P = .011) than men. Sex is an independent prognostic factor for patients with LEC or MEC. As secondary hypotheses, in comparison with men, women age 55 years or older with squamous cell LEC and women younger than age 55 years with squamous cell MEC have a significantly better outcome. These last two findings need further validation.",Journal Article,2808.0,62.0,"The prognostic value of sex for cancer survival is currently unclear and growing data suggest that hormonal influences may account for incidence disparities between men and women Therefore moving from the hypothesis that hormones could affect the prognosis of patients with cancer we investigated the primary hypothesis that sex is associated with survival and the secondary hypotheses that the relationship between sex and survival depends at least in part on age histology and race/ethnicity By using the SEER databases from 1973 to 2007 we identified 13,603 patients 34 with metastatic cancer MEC and 26,848 patients 66 with locoregional cancer LEC Cox proportional hazards model for competing risks were used for analyses In the multivariate analysis women had longer cancer-specific survival ECSS than men in both MEC hazard ratio HR 0.949 95 CI 0.905 to 0.995 P .029 and LEC HR 0.920 95 CI 0.886 to 0.955 P .001 cohorts When age and histology were accounted for there was no difference for ECSS between men and women with adenocarcinoma In contrast women younger than age 55 years HR 0.896 95 CI 0.792 to 1.014 P .081 and those age 55 years or older HR 0.905 95 CI 0.862 to 0.950 P .001 with squamous cell LEC had longer ECSS than men In the squamous cell MEC cohort only women younger than age 55 years had longer ECSS HR 0.823 95 CI 0.708 to 0.957 P .011 than men Sex is an independent prognostic factor for patients with LEC or MEC As secondary hypotheses in comparison with men women age 55 years or older with squamous cell LEC and women younger than age 55 years with squamous cell MEC have a significantly better outcome These last two findings need further validation",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[3, 177, 549, 1, 1035, 9, 12, 25, 16, 694, 1200, 2, 1921, 74, 309, 17, 1761, 3859, 68, 1967, 9, 287, 2227, 59, 325, 2, 117, 673, 8324, 29, 3, 1492, 17, 4927, 359, 1158, 3, 356, 1, 7, 5, 12, 21, 565, 3, 86, 1492, 17, 1035, 16, 41, 5, 25, 2, 3, 568, 6243, 17, 3, 858, 59, 1035, 2, 25, 3828, 28, 506, 4, 760, 23, 89, 784, 2, 1047, 2091, 20, 75, 3, 1605, 2348, 29, 4756, 6, 1307, 21, 108, 233, 9696, 7, 562, 5, 113, 12, 7391, 2, 432, 15455, 7, 700, 5, 1325, 12, 12370, 418, 831, 1017, 202, 9, 2573, 1098, 11, 95, 9, 318, 4, 3, 331, 65, 117, 42, 589, 12, 112, 25, 35363, 76, 325, 4, 110, 7391, 360, 197, 168, 13, 14916, 48, 58, 13, 13300, 6, 13, 13563, 19, 4770, 2, 12370, 168, 13, 11533, 48, 58, 13, 14577, 6, 13, 17361, 19, 144, 736, 198, 89, 2, 784, 11, 3688, 9, 125, 10, 77, 523, 9, 35363, 59, 325, 2, 117, 5, 449, 4, 748, 117, 773, 76, 89, 614, 60, 168, 13, 14554, 48, 58, 13, 13760, 6, 14, 3618, 19, 16048, 2, 135, 89, 614, 60, 15, 434, 168, 13, 13300, 48, 58, 13, 10753, 6, 13, 14109, 19, 144, 5, 691, 31, 12370, 42, 589, 35363, 76, 325, 4, 3, 691, 31, 7391, 180, 158, 117, 773, 76, 89, 614, 60, 42, 589, 35363, 168, 13, 12613, 48, 58, 13, 9687, 6, 13, 15277, 19, 3651, 76, 325, 1035, 16, 35, 306, 177, 161, 9, 7, 5, 12370, 15, 7391, 22, 568, 6243, 4, 1155, 5, 325, 117, 89, 614, 60, 15, 434, 5, 691, 31, 12370, 2, 117, 773, 76, 89, 614, 60, 5, 691, 31, 7391, 47, 8, 97, 380, 228, 46, 1060, 100, 272, 594, 195, 929]",1681.0,22585694,586

Phase I study of pazopanib in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin given every 21 days in patients with advanced solid tumors.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2012-06-07,"Several phase III trials have shown that the addition of an antiangiogenic agent to conventional chemotherapy can improve clinical benefit in patients with advanced solid tumors. This study examined the feasibility of combining pazopanib (Votrient), an oral antiangiogenic agent, with paclitaxel and carboplatin. This 3 + 3 dose-escalation phase I study evaluated the maximum-tolerated regimen (MTR) of daily pazopanib in combination with paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) and carboplatin [dosed at area under the curve (AUC) 5 or 6] given every 21 days in patients with advanced solid tumors. Plasma samples were collected to evaluate the effect of pazopanib on the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel and carboplatin. Thirty-four patients were enrolled. The MTR was paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) and carboplatin AUC5 with pazopanib 200 mg. The most common dose-limiting toxicities were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Two patients with esophageal cancer had a complete response and four patients, one each with breast, small-cell lung, pancreatic, and gastroesophageal junction cancer, had partial responses. Pazopanib at 200 mg increased paclitaxel maximal concentration (C(max)) by 43% and carboplatin (AUC5 or AUC6) C(max) by 54%. Paclitaxel and carboplatin given every 21 days at standard doses was not feasible in combination with the monotherapy pazopanib dose of 800 mg daily because of dose-limiting myelosuppression. Coadministration of pazopanib increased exposure to paclitaxel and carboplatin and likely contributed to this effect.

"Gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas of the esophagus, stomach, and colon exhibit distinct patterns of genome instability and oncogenesis.",Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2012-07-02,"A more detailed understanding of the somatic genetic events that drive gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas is necessary to improve diagnosis and therapy. Using data from high-density genomic profiling arrays, we conducted an analysis of somatic copy-number aberrations in 486 gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas including 296 esophageal and gastric cancers. Focal amplifications were substantially more prevalent in gastric/esophageal adenocarcinomas than colorectal tumors. We identified 64 regions of significant recurrent amplification and deletion, some shared and others unique to the adenocarcinoma types examined. Amplified genes were noted in 37% of gastric/esophageal tumors, including in therapeutically targetable kinases such as ERBB2, FGFR1, FGFR2, EGFR, and MET, suggesting the potential use of genomic amplifications as biomarkers to guide therapy of gastric and esophageal cancers where targeted therapeutics have been less developed compared with colorectal cancers. Amplified loci implicated genes with known involvement in carcinogenesis but also pointed to regions harboring potentially novel cancer genes, including a recurrent deletion found in 15% of esophageal tumors where the Runt transcription factor subunit RUNX1 was implicated, including by functional experiments in tissue culture.

Hyperfractionated or accelerated radiotherapy in lung cancer: an individual patient data meta-analysis.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2012-07-02,"In lung cancer, randomized trials assessing hyperfractionated or accelerated radiotherapy seem to yield conflicting results regarding the effects on overall (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS). The Meta-Analysis of Radiotherapy in Lung Cancer Collaborative Group decided to address the role of modified radiotherapy fractionation. We performed an individual patient data meta-analysis in patients with nonmetastatic lung cancer, which included trials comparing modified radiotherapy with conventional radiotherapy. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC; 10 trials, 2,000 patients), modified fractionation improved OS as compared with conventional schedules (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.88, 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.97; P = .009), resulting in an absolute benefit of 2.5% (8.3% to 10.8%) at 5 years. No evidence of heterogeneity between trials was found. There was no evidence of a benefit on PFS (HR = 0.94; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.03; P = .19). Modified radiotherapy reduced deaths resulting from lung cancer (HR = 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81 to 0.98; P = .02), and there was a nonsignificant reduction of non-lung cancer deaths (HR = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.15; P = .33). In small-cell lung cancer (SCLC; two trials, 685 patients), similar results were found: OS, HR = 0.87, 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.02, P = .08; PFS, HR = 0.88, 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.03, P = .11. In both NSCLC and SCLC, the use of modified radiotherapy increased the risk of acute esophageal toxicity (odds ratio [OR] = 2.44 in NSCLC and OR = 2.41 in SCLC; P < .001) but did not have an impact on the risk of other acute toxicities.

Angiogenesis-related agents in esophageal cancer.,Expert opinion on biological therapy,Expert Opin Biol Ther,2012-08-04,"Esophageal cancer is an aggressive disease with poor prognosis. The majority of the patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage and many with early stage disease will develop recurrent disease. Angiogenesis is essential to the progress and aggressiveness of solid malignancies. Success of anti-angiogenic therapy in colorectal, lung and breast cancers is a proof of principle. Thus far, evidence for benefit from anti-angiogenic therapy in esophageal cancer is lacking. Several Phase II trials with different agents have provided mixed results and the only Phase III trial in the esophageal and gastric cancer failed to show that these agents improve overall survival (OS). However, lack of observed benefit could be due to the challenges specific to the management of esophageal cancers as well as issues with the design of clinical trials for anti-angiogenic therapy. An understanding of the biology of the esophageal cancer and its management is essential to the development of anti-angiogenic therapy in this disease.

Propensity score-based comparison of long-term outcomes with 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy vs intensity-modulated radiotherapy for esophageal cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-08-03,"Although 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) is the worldwide standard for the treatment of esophageal cancer, intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) improves dose conformality and reduces the radiation exposure to normal tissues. We hypothesized that the dosimetric advantages of IMRT should translate to substantive benefits in clinical outcomes compared with 3D-CRT. An analysis was performed of 676 nonrandomized patients (3D-CRT, n=413; IMRT, n=263) with stage Ib-IVa (American Joint Committee on Cancer 2002) esophageal cancers treated with chemoradiotherapy at a single institution from 1998-2008. An inverse probability of treatment weighting and inclusion of propensity score (treatment probability) as a covariate were used to compare overall survival time, interval to local failure, and interval to distant metastasis, while accounting for the effects of other clinically relevant covariates. The propensity scores were estimated using logistic regression analysis. A fitted multivariate inverse probability weighted-adjusted Cox model showed that the overall survival time was significantly associated with several well-known prognostic factors, along with the treatment modality (IMRT vs 3D-CRT, hazard ratio 0.72, P<.001). Compared with IMRT, 3D-CRT patients had a significantly greater risk of dying (72.6% vs 52.9%, inverse probability of treatment weighting, log-rank test, P<.0001) and of locoregional recurrence (P=.0038). No difference was seen in cancer-specific mortality (Gray's test, P=.86) or distant metastasis (P=.99) between the 2 groups.

Automated volumetric modulated Arc therapy treatment planning for stage III lung cancer: how does it compare with intensity-modulated radio therapy?,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-09-01,"To compare the quality of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans generated by an automated inverse planning system with that of dosimetrist-generated IMRT treatment plans for patients with stage III lung cancer. Two groups of 8 patients with stage III lung cancer were randomly selected. For group 1, the dosimetrists spent their best effort in designing IMRT plans to compete with the automated inverse planning system (mdaccAutoPlan); for group 2, the dosimetrists were not in competition and spent their regular effort. Five experienced radiation oncologists independently blind-reviewed and ranked the three plans for each patient: a rank of 1 was the best and 3 was the worst. Dosimetric measures were also performed to quantitatively evaluate the three types of plans. Blind rankings from different oncologists were generally consistent. For group 1, the auto-VMAT, auto-IMRT, and manual IMRT plans received average ranks of 1.6, 2.13, and 2.18, respectively. The auto-VMAT plans in group 1 had 10% higher planning tumor volume (PTV) conformality and 24% lower esophagus V70 (the volume receiving 70 Gy or more) than the manual IMRT plans; they also resulted in more than 20% higher complication-free tumor control probability (P+) than either type of IMRT plans. The auto- and manual IMRT plans in this group yielded generally comparable dosimetric measures. For group 2, the auto-VMAT, auto-IMRT, and manual IMRT plans received average ranks of 1.55, 1.75, and 2.75, respectively. Compared to the manual IMRT plans in this group, the auto-VMAT plans and auto-IMRT plans showed, respectively, 17% and 14% higher PTV dose conformality, 8% and 17% lower mean lung dose, 17% and 26% lower mean heart dose, and 36% and 23% higher P+. mdaccAutoPlan is capable of generating high-quality VMAT and IMRT treatment plans for stage III lung cancer.

Salvage esophagectomy after failed definitive chemoradiation for esophageal adenocarcinoma.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2012-08-24,"Outcomes of salvage esophagectomy after definitive chemoradiation (CRT) for squamous cell carcinoma are well defined. Previous reports of salvage esophagectomy in patients with recurrent adenocarcinoma after definitive CRT are limited by small numbers and high morbidity and mortality rates. We reviewed our experience of 65 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma treated from 1997 to 2010 who underwent salvage esophagectomy after failed definitive CRT. We then compared this group to 65 matched patients of 521 total patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma who received preoperative CRT followed by planned esophagectomy. Propensity matching and multivariable analysis were performed. Median time to surgery from completion of therapy for the salvage group was 216 days. Major postoperative events (major pulmonary event, conduit loss, leak, readmission to intensive care unit) occurred in 35% (23 of 65) of salvage patients and 31% (20 of 65) of the planned resection matched group. Anastomotic leak occurred in 18.5% (12 of 65) and 11.3 (59 of 521) of salvage and planned groups, respectively. Thirty-day mortality was 3.1% (2 of 65) after salvage resection and 4.6% (3 of 65) after planned resection. There was no difference in 3-year overall or median survival between the two groups of patients (32 months, 48% salvage, versus 40 months, 57% planned resection). Multivariable analysis did not identify salvage strategy or time from completion of therapy to resection as a predictor of major event or death. Postoperative morbidity, mortality, and overall survival of patients after salvage esophagectomy are comparable to matched patients after planned resection. These results suggest that patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma who fail definitive CRT and recur locoregionally should be considered for salvage esophagectomy at experienced esophageal centers.",Comparative Study,2706.0,46.0,Outcomes of salvage esophagectomy after definitive chemoradiation CRT for squamous cell carcinoma are well defined Previous reports of salvage esophagectomy in patients with recurrent adenocarcinoma after definitive CRT are limited by small numbers and high morbidity and mortality rates We reviewed our experience of 65 patients with adenocarcinoma treated from 1997 to 2010 who underwent salvage esophagectomy after failed definitive CRT We then compared this group to 65 matched patients of 521 total patients with adenocarcinoma who received preoperative CRT followed by planned esophagectomy Propensity matching and multivariable analysis were performed Median time to surgery from completion of therapy for the salvage group was 216 days Major postoperative events major pulmonary event conduit loss leak readmission to intensive care unit occurred in 35 23 of 65 of salvage patients and 31 20 of 65 of the planned resection matched group Anastomotic leak occurred in 18.5 12 of 65 and 11.3 59 of 521 of salvage and planned groups respectively Thirty-day mortality was 3.1 2 of 65 after salvage resection and 4.6 3 of 65 after planned resection There was no difference in 3-year overall or median survival between the two groups of patients 32 months 48 salvage versus 40 months 57 planned resection Multivariable analysis did not identify salvage strategy or time from completion of therapy to resection as a predictor of major event or death Postoperative morbidity mortality and overall survival of patients after salvage esophagectomy are comparable to matched patients after planned resection These results suggest that patients with adenocarcinoma who fail definitive CRT and recur locoregionally should be considered for salvage esophagectomy at experienced centers,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[123, 1, 992, 3617, 50, 1057, 975, 1089, 9, 691, 31, 134, 32, 149, 395, 698, 1198, 1, 992, 3617, 4, 7, 5, 387, 449, 50, 1057, 1089, 32, 383, 20, 302, 1870, 2, 64, 787, 2, 282, 151, 21, 446, 114, 730, 1, 556, 7, 5, 449, 73, 29, 2341, 6, 1120, 54, 208, 992, 3617, 50, 1551, 1057, 1089, 21, 818, 72, 26, 87, 6, 556, 655, 7, 1, 11925, 181, 7, 5, 449, 54, 103, 498, 1089, 370, 20, 1465, 3617, 1925, 2616, 2, 658, 65, 11, 173, 52, 98, 6, 152, 29, 1438, 1, 36, 9, 3, 992, 87, 10, 6287, 162, 458, 573, 281, 458, 1087, 774, 10439, 407, 4238, 3146, 6, 1686, 165, 2712, 489, 4, 465, 382, 1, 556, 1, 992, 7, 2, 456, 179, 1, 556, 1, 3, 1465, 170, 655, 87, 4818, 4238, 489, 4, 203, 33, 133, 1, 556, 2, 175, 27, 728, 1, 11925, 1, 992, 2, 1465, 271, 106, 977, 218, 282, 10, 27, 14, 18, 1, 556, 50, 992, 170, 2, 39, 49, 27, 1, 556, 50, 1465, 170, 125, 10, 77, 523, 4, 27, 111, 63, 15, 52, 25, 59, 3, 100, 271, 1, 7, 531, 53, 576, 992, 185, 327, 53, 696, 1465, 170, 658, 65, 205, 44, 255, 992, 692, 15, 98, 29, 1438, 1, 36, 6, 170, 22, 8, 980, 1, 458, 774, 15, 273, 573, 787, 282, 2, 63, 25, 1, 7, 50, 992, 3617, 32, 1279, 6, 655, 7, 50, 1465, 170, 46, 99, 309, 17, 7, 5, 449, 54, 4373, 1057, 1089, 2, 5609, 6410, 257, 40, 515, 9, 992, 3617, 28, 592, 1168]",1778.0,22921233,38
Metformin use and improved response to therapy in esophageal adenocarcinoma.,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",Acta Oncol,2012-09-05,"We investigated the radiographic and pathologic response rate of esophageal adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation in patients taking metformin. Two hundred eighty-five patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma treated with concurrent chemoradiation (CRT) followed by esophagectomy from 1997 to 2012 were included in the study, including 29 diabetics taking metformin, 21 diabetics not taking metformin and 235 non-diabetics. Pre- and post-treatment positron emission tomography (PET) scans were available for 204 patients. Pathologic response was graded at the time of surgery. Response rates were compared using both the χ(2) statistic as well as ANOVA with post-hoc LSD analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to control for predictors of pathologic complete response (CR) after CRT. The overall rate of pathologic CR for the study population was 20%. The pathologic CR rate was higher in patients taking metformin (34.5%), compared to diabetic patients not taking metformin (4.8%, p = 0.01) and non-diabetic patients (19.6%, p = 0.05). Pathologic CR was related to metformin dose, with ≥ 1500 mg/d associated with a higher CR rate. No significant difference seen in pre-CRT maximum tumor SUV (p = 0.93), however post-CRT maximum SUV was significantly decreased in patients taking metformin (p = 0.05).

The literature on the outcome of such patients is sparse. Between 2002 and 2011, we identified 622 trimodality-eligible EC patients in our prospectively maintained databases. All patients had to be trimodality eligible and must have completed preoperative staging after chemoradiation that included repeat endoscopic biopsy and PET among other routine tests. Out of 622 trimodality-eligible patients identified, 61 patients (9.8%) declined surgery. All 61 patients had a clinCR. The median age was 69 years (range 47-85).

Adverse prognostic impact of intratumor heterogeneous HER2 gene amplification in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2012-09-17,"There is increasing recognition of the existence of intratumoral heterogeneity of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2), which affects interpretation of HER2 positivity in clinical practice and may have implications for patient prognosis and treatment. We determined the frequency and prognostic impact of heterogeneous HER2 gene amplification and polysomy 17 in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). HER2 amplification (by fluorescence in situ hybridization) was examined in surgical EAC specimens (n = 675). HER2 heterogeneity was defined according to consensus guidelines as gene amplification (HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥ 2.0) in more than 5% but less than 50% of cancer cells. No patient received neoadjuvant or HER2-targeted therapy. Cox models were used to assess disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS). Overall, 117 EACs (17%) demonstrated HER2 amplification, of which 20 (17%) showed HER2 heterogeneity. All HER2-heterogeneous tumors were amplified. Among HER2-amplified tumors, heterogeneous tumors had significantly higher frequency of poor histologic grade and polysomy 17. In multivariable models that included number of metastatic lymph nodes, grade, tumor stage, and polysomy 17, only HER2 heterogeneity and node number were prognostic among HER2-amplified tumors, with heterogeneity showing worse DSS (hazard ratio, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.09 to 3.79; P = .025) and OS (P = .026). Among HER2-nonamplified EACs, polysomy 17 was independently associated with worse DSS (P = .012) and OS (P = .023). Among HER2-amplified EACs, 17% show HER2 heterogeneity, which independently predicts for worse cancer-specific death. Among HER2-nonamplified EACs, polysomy 17 is independently associated with worse survival.

Sparing the larynx and esophageal inlet expedites feeding tube removal in patients with stage III-IV oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy.,The Laryngoscope,Laryngoscope,2012-09-18,"To evaluate the effect of larynx and esophageal inlet sparing on dysphagia recovery after intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for stage III-IV oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Retrospective study. Of 88 patients treated with IMRT, 38 were planned with a larynx + esophageal inlet mean dose <50 Gy constraint, 27 with a larynx alone mean dose constraint of <50 Gy, and 23 without a larynx/esophagus constraint. All had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placed before IMRT, which was removed when the patient could swallow and maintain weight. All IMRT plans were retrieved, and the larynx; esophageal inlet; and superior, middle, and inferior constrictors were contoured. Dosimetric data were correlated with PEG tube dependence duration. The PEG tube was removed within 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after IMRT in 24%, 61%, 71%, and 83% of patients, respectively. Median times to PEG tube removal were 3.7 and 8.6 months (P = .0029) in patients planned with or without a larynx/larynx + esophageal inlet dose constraint.

In the phase I portion, cohort 1 received no erlotinib, whereas cohorts 2 and 3 received erlotinib at 100 and 150 mg, respectively, Tuesday through Friday, during TCRT. Consolidation therapy with erlotinib (150 mg daily) and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks) was planned 3 to 6 weeks later for six cycles. Forty-five eligible patients were enrolled. The objective response rates to induction and overall treatment were 39% (95% CI, 24% to 55%) and 60% (95% CI, 44% to 75%), respectively.

Critical role for the receptor tyrosine kinase EPHB4 in esophageal cancers.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2012-10-24,"Esophageal cancer incidence is increasing and has few treatment options. In studying receptor tyrosine kinases associated with esophageal cancers, we have identified EPHB4 to be robustly overexpressed in cell lines and primary tumor tissues. In total, 94 squamous cell carcinoma, 82 adenocarcinoma, 25 dysplasia, 13 Barrett esophagus, and 25 adjacent or unrelated normal esophageal tissues were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. EPHB4 expression was significantly higher in all the different histologic categories than in adjacent normal tissues. In 13 esophageal cancer cell lines, 3 of the 9 SCC cell lines and 2 of the 4 adenocarcinomas expressed very high levels of EPHB4. An increased gene copy number ranging from 4 to 20 copies was identified in a subset of the overexpressing patient samples and cell lines. We have developed a novel 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO)-induced mouse model of esophageal cancer that recapitulates the EPHB4 expression in humans. A specific small-molecule inhibitor of EPHB4 decreased cell viability in a time- and dose-dependent manner in 3 of the 4 cell lines tested. The small-molecule inhibitor and an EPHB4 siRNA also decreased cell migration (12%-40% closure in treated vs. 60%-80% in untreated), with decreased phosphorylation of various tyrosyl-containing proteins, EphB4, and its downstream target p125FAK.

Prevention of Barrett esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma by smoothened inhibitor in a rat model of gastroesophageal reflux disease.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2013-07-01,"Activated hedgehog (Hh) pathway is associated with development of both Barrett esophagus (BE) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). We hypothesize that blockade of the Hh pathway with smoothened (Smo) inhibitor can prevent the development of BE/EAC in the Levrat model, in which induced gastroduodenoesophageal reflux (GDER) leads to esophageal carcinogenesis. GDER was induced in 6- to 8-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. The Smo inhibitor (10 mg/kg/d) was given orally on postoperative weeks 10 to 16, 18 to 22, and 24 to 28, and rats were killed on week 28. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of BE and EAC. To examine potential therapeutic effects of Smo inhibition on tumor tissue, semiquantitative immunohistochemistry for Ki-67 and caspase 3 was performed. In treated animals that developed cancer, gene expression was analyzed.

Although the addition of epirubicin to the standard 2-drug regimen is part of routine practice, there are no randomized data to support a benefit. In contrast, the docetaxel-based docetaxel/cisplatin/5-FU regimen has been shown to modestly improve survival compared with 5-FU/cisplatin alone but at the expense of significant additional toxicity, which has hindered widespread acceptance of this regimen. Irinotecan-containing regimens have also been evaluated in a few phase III evaluations but are not clearly superior to 5-FU/cisplatin or even infusional 5-FU alone. Nevertheless, their favorable toxicity profile indicates that infusional 5-FU/irinotecan regimens also represent a first-line therapy option.

Targeted therapies with chemoradiation in esophageal cancer: development and future directions.,Seminars in radiation oncology,Semin Radiat Oncol,2013-01-01,"Targeted therapies have been studied in combination with chemoradiation therapy for esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancers. To date, the Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) HER2, epidermal growth factor receptor, and vascular endothelial growth factor pathways have been most extensively studied in esophagogastric cancers.

The majority of GI cancers are unresectable at the time of diagnosis, and in the subset of patients undergoing resection, few are cured. There is only a modest improvement in survival with the addition of modalities such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Due to an increasing global cancer burden, it is imperative to integrate alternative strategies to improve outcomes. It is well known that cancers possess diverse strategies to evade immune detection and destruction.

A review was conducted of the results of published clinical trials employing immunotherapy for esophageal, gastroesophageal, gastric, hepatocellular, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers. Monoclonal antibody therapy has come to the forefront in the past decade for the treatment of colorectal cancer. Immunotherapeutic successes in solid cancers such as melanoma and prostate cancer have led to the active investigation of immunotherapy for GI malignancies, with some promising results. To date, monoclonal antibody therapy is the only immunotherapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for GI cancers.

Synchronous cancers in patients with head and neck cancer: risks in the era of human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2013-02-19,"Second primary malignancies (SPMs) are the leading cause of death in survivors of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Synchronous SPMs are of significant clinical interest because they potentially can be identified by screening procedures at the time of diagnosis of the index cancer. Recently, human papillomavirus (HPV) has emerged as a distinct risk factor for oropharyngeal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), differing from classic tobacco/alcohol-associated HNSCC, suggesting that there also may be distinct patterns of synchronous SPMs. The authors performed a population-based cohort study in 64,673 patients in the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry (1979-2008), defining risks of synchronous SPM in patients with HNSCC who were diagnosed before and after the emergence of prevalent HPV-associated oropharyngeal HNSCC. Excess risk was calculated using standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and excess absolute risk per 100 patients. Among patients with HNSCC, the SIR of synchronous SPM was 5.0, corresponding to 2.62 excess cases per 100 patients. The site with the highest excess risk of a second cancer was the head and neck (SIR, 41.4), followed by the esophagus (SIR, 21.8), and lung (SIR, 7.4). The risk of synchronous SPM changed markedly over time for patients with oropharyngeal HNSCC. In the 1970s and 1980s, oropharyngeal cancers carried the highest risk of SPM. Risk began to dramatically decline in the 1990s; and currently, oropharyngeal cancers carry the lowest risk of synchronous SPM.

MicroRNA expression signatures during malignant progression from Barrett's esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma.,"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",Cancer Prev Res (Phila),2013-03-01,"Barrett's esophagus is the precursor lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma, whose progression follows sequential stages. However, the low progression rate and the inadequacy and subjective interpretation of histologic grading in predicting Barrett's esophagus progression call for more objective biomarkers that can improve risk prediction. We conducted a genome-wide profiling of 754 human microRNAs (miRNA) in 35 normal epithelium, 34 Barrett's esophagus, and 36 esophageal adenocarcinoma tissues using TaqMan real-time PCR-based profiling. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering using 294 modestly to highly expressed miRNAs showed clear clustering of two groups: normal epithelium versus Barrett's esophagus/esophageal adenocarcinoma tissues. Moreover, there was an excellent clustering of Barrett's metaplasia (without dysplasia) tissues from normal epithelium tissues. However, Barrett's esophagus tissues of different stages and esophageal adenocarcinoma tissues were interspersed. There were differentially expressed miRNAs at different stages. The majority of miRNA aberrations involved upregulation of expression in Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma tissues, with the most dramatic alterations occurring at the Barrett's metaplasia stage. Known oncomiRs, such as miR-21, miR-25, and miR-223, and tumor suppressor miRNAs, including miR-205, miR-203, let-7c, and miR-133a, showed progressively altered expression from Barrett's esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma. We also identified a number of novel miRNAs that showed progressively altered expression, including miR-301b, miR-618, and miR-23b.

Systemic chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment, but survival with current regimens remains poor. We evaluated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the combination capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab in the treatment of metastatic esophagogastric adenocarcinomas. Thirty-seven patients with metastatic or unresectable gastric/gastroesophageal junction tumors were enrolled and treated with capecitabine 850 mg/m(2) BID on days 1-14, and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2) with bevacizumab 15 mg/kg on day 1 of a 21-day cycle. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included response rate (RR) and overall survival (OS). Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and -2 (NRP2) mRNA expression was evaluated in archived tumor. Thirty-five patients were evaluable for efficacy. Median PFS was 7.2 months; median OS was 10.8 months. RR was estimated at 51.4%. The regimen was tolerable with expected drug class-related toxicities. NRP2 mRNA levels significantly correlated with PFS (p = 0.042) and showed a trend toward significance with OS (p = 0.051). Nonsignificant trends for NRP1 were noted for higher expression levels and worse outcome. Bevacizumab can be given safely with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic esophagogastric adenocarcinomas.

This study aims to examine outcomes after esophagectomy in elderly patients. This study is a retrospective review of 474 patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer during 2002 to 2011. A total of 334 (70.5%) patients were less than 70 years old (group A), 124 (26.2%) 70 to 79 years (group B), and 16 (3.4%) 80 years or greater (group C). We analyzed the effect of age on outcome variables including overall and disease specific survival. Major morbidity was observed to occur in 115 (35.6%) patients of group A, 58 (47.9%) of group B, and 10 (62.5%) of group C (p = 0.010). Mortality, both 30-day and 90-day was observed in 2 (0.6%) and 7 (2.2%) of group A, 4 (3.2%) and 7 (6.1%) of group B, and 1 (6.3%) and 2 (14.3%) of group C, respectively (p = 0.032 and p = 0.013). Anastomotic leak was observed in 16 (4.8%) patients of group A, 6 (4.8%) of group B, and 0 (0%) of group C (p = 0.685). Anastomotic stricture (defined by the need for ≥ 2 dilations) was observed in 76 (22.8%) of group A, 13 (10.5%) of group B, and 1 (6.3%) of group C (p = 0.005). Five-year overall and disease specific survival was 64.8% and 72.4% for group A, 41.7% and 53.4% for group B, 49.2% and 49.2% for group C patients (p = 0.0006), respectively.

Outcomes associated with surgery for T4 esophageal cancer.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2013-03-16,"T4 esophageal cancer often portends a dismal prognosis even after surgical resection. Historical incomplete resections and poor survival rates often make surgery palliative rather than curative. Using a comprehensive esophageal cancer database, we identified patients who underwent an esophagectomy for T4 tumors between 1994 and 2011. Neoadjuvant treatment (NT) and pathologic response variables were recorded, and response was denoted as complete response (pCR), partial response (pPR), and nonresponse (NR). Clinical and pathologic data were compared. Survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank tests for significance. We identified 45 patients with T4 tumors all who underwent NT. The median age was 60 years (range, 31-79 years) with a median follow-up of 27 months (range, 0-122 months). There were 19 pCR (42 %), 22 pPR (49 %), and 4 NR (9 %). R0 resections were accomplished in 43 (96 %). There were 18 recurrences (40 %) with a median time to recurrence of 13.5 months (2.2-71 months). In this group pCR represented 7 (38.9 %), whereas pPR and NR represented 10 (55.5 %), and 1 (5.5 %) respectively.

Loss of TGF-β adaptor β2SP activates notch signaling and SOX9 expression in esophageal adenocarcinoma.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2013-03-27,"TGF-β and Notch signaling pathways play important roles in regulating self-renewal of stem cells and gastrointestinal carcinogenesis. Loss of TGF-β signaling components activates Notch signaling in esophageal adenocarcinoma, but the basis for this effect has been unclear. Here we report that loss of TGF-β adapter β2SP (SPNB2) activates Notch signaling and its target SOX9 in primary fibroblasts or esophageal adenocarcinoma cells. Expression of the stem cell marker SOX9 was markedly higher in esophageal adenocarcinoma tumor tissues than normal tissues, and its higher nuclear staining in tumors correlated with poorer survival and lymph node invasion in esophageal adenocarcinoma patients. Downregulation of β2SP by lentivirus short hairpin RNA increased SOX9 transcription and expression, enhancing nuclear localization for both active Notch1 (intracellular Notch1, ICN1) and SOX9. In contrast, reintroduction into esophageal adenocarcinoma cells of β2SP and a dominant-negative mutant of the Notch coactivator mastermind-like (dnMAN) decreased SOX9 promoter activity. Tumor sphere formation and invasive capacity in vitro and tumor growth in vivo were increased in β2SP-silenced esophageal adenocarcinoma cells. Conversely, SOX9 silencing rescued the phenotype of esophageal adenocarcinoma cells with loss of β2SP. Interaction between Smad3 and ICN1 via Smad3 MH1 domain was also observed, with loss of β2SP increasing the binding between these proteins, inducing expression of Notch targets SOX9 and C-MYC, and decreasing expression of TGF-β targets p21(CDKN1A), p27 (CDKN1B), and E-cadherin. Taken together, our findings suggest that loss of β2SP switches TGF-β signaling from tumor suppression to tumor promotion by engaging Notch signaling and activating SOX9.",Journal Article,2491.0,38.0,TGF-β and Notch signaling pathways play important roles in regulating self-renewal of stem cells and carcinogenesis Loss of TGF-β signaling components activates Notch signaling in adenocarcinoma but the basis for this effect has been unclear Here we report that loss of TGF-β adapter β2SP SPNB2 activates Notch signaling and its target SOX9 in primary fibroblasts or adenocarcinoma cells Expression of the stem cell marker SOX9 was markedly higher in adenocarcinoma tumor tissues than normal tissues and its higher nuclear staining in tumors correlated with poorer survival and lymph node invasion in adenocarcinoma patients Downregulation of β2SP by lentivirus short hairpin RNA increased SOX9 transcription and expression enhancing nuclear localization for both active Notch1 intracellular Notch1 ICN1 and SOX9 In contrast reintroduction into adenocarcinoma cells of β2SP and a dominant-negative mutant of the Notch coactivator mastermind-like dnMAN decreased SOX9 promoter activity Tumor sphere formation and invasive capacity in vitro and tumor growth in vivo were increased in β2SP-silenced adenocarcinoma cells Conversely SOX9 silencing rescued the phenotype of adenocarcinoma cells with loss of β2SP Interaction between Smad3 and ICN1 via Smad3 MH1 domain was also observed with loss of β2SP increasing the binding between these proteins inducing expression of Notch targets SOX9 and C-MYC and decreasing expression of TGF-β targets p21 CDKN1A p27 CDKN1B and E-cadherin Taken together our findings suggest that loss of β2SP switches TGF-β signaling from tumor suppression to tumor promotion by engaging Notch signaling and activating SOX9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[2387, 1458, 2, 3193, 314, 460, 1343, 305, 1790, 4, 2681, 1074, 4495, 1, 452, 37, 2, 1719, 407, 1, 2387, 1458, 314, 1628, 3932, 3193, 314, 4, 449, 84, 3, 877, 9, 26, 254, 71, 85, 1200, 467, 21, 414, 17, 407, 1, 2387, 1458, 23192, 18029, 62643, 3932, 3193, 314, 2, 211, 283, 8428, 4, 86, 3921, 15, 449, 37, 55, 1, 3, 452, 31, 952, 8428, 10, 2195, 142, 4, 449, 30, 742, 76, 295, 742, 2, 211, 142, 928, 1029, 4, 57, 438, 5, 1769, 25, 2, 263, 289, 578, 4, 449, 7, 2475, 1, 18029, 20, 13963, 978, 5957, 893, 101, 8428, 866, 2, 55, 2430, 928, 2145, 9, 110, 544, 4607, 2087, 4607, 22566, 2, 8428, 4, 748, 14721, 237, 449, 37, 1, 18029, 2, 8, 2156, 199, 620, 1, 3, 3193, 8777, 24571, 733, 62644, 340, 8428, 973, 128, 30, 8960, 1264, 2, 416, 2162, 4, 439, 2, 30, 129, 4, 386, 11, 101, 4, 18029, 5442, 449, 37, 3154, 8428, 2077, 7008, 3, 1005, 1, 449, 37, 5, 407, 1, 18029, 915, 59, 10675, 2, 22566, 847, 10675, 62645, 1398, 10, 120, 164, 5, 407, 1, 18029, 602, 3, 791, 59, 46, 652, 1958, 55, 1, 3193, 637, 8428, 2, 256, 1371, 2, 2777, 55, 1, 2387, 1458, 637, 2657, 10576, 2804, 14591, 2, 563, 2154, 1633, 1162, 114, 272, 309, 17, 407, 1, 18029, 23503, 2387, 1458, 314, 29, 30, 1332, 6, 30, 5478, 20, 8534, 3193, 314, 2, 1616, 8428]",1645.0,23536563,6

Radiation therapy and esophageal cancer.,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,Cancer Control,2013-04-01,"Squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma account for more than 90% of all esophageal cancer cases. Although the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma has declined, the incidence of adenocarcinoma has risen due to increases in obesity and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The authors examine the role of radiation therapy alone (external beam and brachytherapy) for the management of esophageal cancer or combined with other modalities. The impact on staging and appropriate stratification of patients referred for curative vs palliative intent with modalities is reviewed. The authors also explore the role of emerging radiation technologies. Current data show that neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgical resection is the accepted standard of care, with 3-year overall survival rates ranging from 30% to 60%. The benefit of adjuvant radiation therapy is limited to patients with node-positive cancer. The survival benefit of surgical resection after chemoradiotherapy remains controversial. External beam radiation therapy alone results in few long-term survivors and is considered palliative at best. Radiation dose-escalation has failed to improve local control or survival. Brachytherapy can provide better long-term palliation of dysphagia than metal stent placement. Although three-dimensional conformal treatment planning is the accepted standard, the roles of IMRT and proton therapy are evolving and potentially reduce adverse events due to better sparing of normal tissue.

Targeting the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 in esophageal cancer.,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,Cancer Control,2013-04-01,"The importance of human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER2) in terms of prognosis and aggressiveness of growth has long been known in breast cancer, and interruption of its growth cascade by agents such as trastuzumab and lapatinib has markedly improved outcomes for these patients with HER2 overexpression. HER2 overexpression also occurs in many other tumor types, including esophageal cancer. In this disease, a different scoring system for determining overexpression is used. Limited data exist concerning the biological and therapeutic implications of HER2 overexpression in esophageal cancer. One trial, the so-called ToGA trial, included patients with advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) tumors that overexpressed HER2. Patients who received trastuzumab plus cisplatin-based chemotherapy had more responses and longer progression-free and overall survival than those who received the chemotherapy alone.

Endoscopic therapy of neoplasia related to Barrett's esophagus and endoscopic palliation of esophageal cancer.,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,Cancer Control,2013-04-01,"Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the most important identifiable risk factor for the progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma. This article reviews the current endoscopic therapies for BE with high-grade dysplasia and intramucosal cancer and briefly discusses the endoscopic palliation of advanced esophageal cancer. The diagnosis of low-grade or high-grade dysplasia (HGD) is based on several cytologic criteria that suggest neoplastic transformation of the columnar epithelium. HGD and carcinoma in situ are regarded as equivalent. The presence of dysplasia, particularly HGD, is also a risk factor for synchronous and metachronous adenocarcinoma. Dysplasia is a marker of adenocarcinoma and also has been shown to be the preinvasive lesion. Esophagectomy has been the conventional treatment for T1 esophageal cancer and, although debated, is an appropriate option in some patients with HGD due to the presence of occult cancer in over one-third of patients.

Lymph node harvest in esophageal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2013-04-28,"This study was designed to determine the effects of lymph node (LN) harvest on survival in esophageal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT). An analysis of surgically resected esophageal cancer patients after nCRT was performed to determine an association between the number of LNs resected and survival. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) curves were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank analysis. Multivariate analysis (MVA) was performed by the Cox proportional hazard model. We identified 358 patients with a mean follow-up of 27.3 months. The number of LN removed was not impacted by the type of surgical procedure. The number of LNs removed (<10 vs. ≥10, <12 vs. ≥12, and <15 vs. ≥15) did not impact OS or DFS. We found a significant difference in OS and DFS by pathologic response. The median and 5-year OS for patients with complete, partial, and no response was 65.6 months and 52.7%, 29.7 months and 30.4%, and 17.7 months and 25.4% (p=0.0002). However, the number of LN harvested did not impact OS and DFS when patients were stratified by pathologic response.

Nuclear EGFR protein expression predicts poor survival in early stage non-small cell lung cancer.,"Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",Lung Cancer,2013-04-28,"Nuclear EGFR (nEGFR) has been identified in various human tumor tissues, including cancers of the breast, ovary, oropharynx, and esophagus, and has predicted poor patient outcomes. We sought to determine if protein expression of nEGFR is prognostic in early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Resected stages I and II NSCLC specimens were evaluated for nEGFR protein expression using immunohistochemistry (IHC).

Esophageal carcinoma: are modern targeted therapies shaking the rock?,Current opinion in oncology,Curr Opin Oncol,2013-07-01,"Our current review aims to outline recent progress in the development of modern targeted therapeutic regimens for esophageal cancer. Esophageal cancers demonstrate marked molecular heterogeneity. Modern technology increasingly allows us to identify subgroups of patients whose tumors fit particular molecular profiles. Tumor-based human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) analysis has become a standard part of the work-up for patients with tumors of the esophagogastric junction. The anti-HER-2 antibody, trastuzumab, when added to a chemotherapeutic regimen combining a fluoropyrimidine and platinum, provides a survival benefit for those patients with HER-2 overexpression and/or amplification. Despite large coordinated efforts to establish the efficacy of additional targeted therapeutics, to this point minimal additional benefit has been realized in affecting prominent molecular targets, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptor, in esophageal cancer. Multiple targets of interest remain under investigation with some early encouraging data. These targets include mammalian target of rapamycin, c-MET, insulin like growth factor 1 receptor and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4. Additional improvements in therapy may stem from improved patient selection for combinations of standard cytotoxic regimens, such as platinum-based regimens. Targeted therapeutics have yielded early benefit, but further progress will require a deeper understanding of this disease, improved identification of subpopulations who may derive greater benefit, and continued multicenter efforts to conduct the necessary clinical investigations.",Journal Article,2395.0,9.0,Our current review aims to outline recent progress in the development of modern targeted therapeutic regimens for cancer cancers demonstrate marked molecular heterogeneity Modern technology increasingly allows us to identify subgroups of patients whose tumors fit particular molecular profiles Tumor-based human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 HER-2 analysis has become a standard part of the work-up for patients with tumors of the esophagogastric junction The anti-HER-2 antibody trastuzumab when added to a chemotherapeutic regimen combining a fluoropyrimidine and platinum provides a survival benefit for those patients with HER-2 overexpression and/or amplification Despite large coordinated efforts to establish the efficacy of additional targeted therapeutics to this point minimal additional benefit has been realized in affecting prominent molecular targets such as vascular endothelial growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptor in cancer Multiple targets of interest remain under investigation with some early encouraging data These targets include mammalian target of rapamycin c-MET insulin like growth factor 1 receptor and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 Additional improvements in therapy may stem from improved patient selection for combinations of standard cytotoxic regimens such as platinum-based regimens Targeted therapeutics have yielded early benefit but further progress will require a deeper understanding of this disease improved identification of subpopulations who may derive greater benefit and continued multicenter efforts to conduct the necessary clinical investigations,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[114, 291, 206, 2970, 6, 5277, 435, 1466, 4, 3, 193, 1, 2366, 238, 189, 472, 9, 12, 163, 608, 2003, 219, 1144, 2366, 2033, 1635, 2333, 843, 6, 255, 1453, 1, 7, 1310, 57, 2975, 1454, 219, 1241, 30, 90, 171, 829, 129, 161, 153, 18, 1084, 18, 65, 71, 1417, 8, 260, 760, 1, 3, 1357, 126, 9, 7, 5, 57, 1, 3, 6330, 3322, 3, 312, 1084, 18, 548, 769, 198, 1953, 6, 8, 1573, 477, 1525, 8, 5464, 2, 828, 777, 8, 25, 247, 9, 135, 7, 5, 1084, 18, 851, 2, 15, 1073, 550, 375, 5725, 1413, 6, 1811, 3, 209, 1, 402, 238, 1943, 6, 26, 741, 1048, 402, 247, 71, 85, 8340, 4, 2319, 3689, 219, 637, 225, 22, 756, 845, 129, 161, 2, 829, 129, 161, 153, 4, 12, 232, 637, 1, 1333, 918, 669, 940, 5, 476, 191, 2269, 74, 46, 637, 643, 2359, 283, 1, 1620, 256, 543, 1601, 733, 129, 161, 14, 153, 2, 759, 102, 1448, 448, 39, 402, 1474, 4, 36, 68, 452, 29, 231, 69, 881, 9, 1247, 1, 260, 759, 472, 225, 22, 828, 90, 472, 238, 1943, 47, 2178, 191, 247, 84, 195, 1466, 303, 1353, 8, 6029, 612, 1, 26, 34, 231, 911, 1, 4847, 54, 68, 3823, 378, 247, 2, 1351, 1570, 1413, 6, 4073, 3, 1493, 38, 2492]",1615.0,23680713,175

Surg.,2013-05-29,"Experience with neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CXRT) has raised questions regarding the additional benefit of surgery after locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma patients achieve a clinical response to CXRT. We sought to quantify the value of surgery by comparing the overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of trimodality-eligible patients treated with definitive CXRT vs. CXRT followed by esophagectomy. We identified 143 clinical stage III esophageal adenocarcinoma patients that were eligible for trimodality therapy. All patients successfully completed neoadjuvant CXRT and were considered appropriate candidates for resection. Patients that were medically inoperable were excluded. Cox regression models were used to identify significant predictors of survival. Among the 143 patients eligible for surgery after completing CXRT, 114 underwent resection and 29 did not.

Prognostic implications of signet ring cell histology in esophageal adenocarcinoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2013-05-29,"Signet ring cell esophageal adenocarcinoma histology has been difficult to study in single institution series because of its relative rarity, yet has an anecdotal reputation for poor prognosis. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was examined to assess the prognostic implications of this esophageal adenocarcinoma subtype. All patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma in the SEER database from 2004 to 2009 were included. Univariate and multivariate analyses examining the relationship of signet ring cell histology with overall survival were performed in all patients, as well as those undergoing surgical resection. A total of 596 of 11,825 (5%) study patients had signet ring cell histology. Patients with signet ring cell histology were similar in age, race, and sex distribution, but had a higher grade (P <  .001) and higher stage (P <  .001) at diagnosis. In both the all-patient group as well as those undergoing surgical resection, univariate analyses showed a worse survival in patients with signet ring cell esophageal cancer (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13-1.36 and HR = 1.57; 95% CI = 1.29-1.93, respectively). In multivariate analyses adjusting for covariates, patients with signet ring cell cancer had a worse prognosis than those without (HR = 1.18; 95% CI = 1.07-1.30).

An analysis of patients with surgically resected esophageal cancer from the SEER database between 2004 and 2008 was performed to determine association of adjuvant radiation and lymph node dissection on survival. Survival curves were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank analysis. Multivariate analysis (MVA) was performed by the Cox proportional hazard model. We identified 2109 patients who met inclusion criteria. Radiation was associated with increased survival in stage III patients (p = 0.005), no benefit in stage II (p = 0.075) and IV (p = 0.913) patients, and decreased survival in stage I patients (p < 0.0001). Univariate analysis revealed that radiation therapy was associated with a survival benefit node positive (N1) patients while it was associated with a detriment in survival for node negative (N0) patients. Removing >12 and >15 lymph nodes was associated with increased survival in N0 patients, while removing >8, >10, >12, >15, and >20 lymph nodes was associated with a survival benefit in N1 patients. MVA revealed that age, gender, tumor and nodal stage, tumor location, and number of lymph nodes removed were prognostic for survival in N0 patients. In N1 patients, MVA showed the age, tumor stage, number of lymph nodes removed, and radiation were prognostic for survival. The number of lymph nodes removed in esophageal cancer is associated with increased survival.

Endoscopic diagnosis and treatment of esophageal cavernous lymphangioma.,"Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",Surg Laparosc Endosc Percutan Tech,2013-06-01,"The purpose of this paper is to identify the characteristic endoscopic findings in patients with esophageal cavernous lymphangioma and assess the efficacy of endoscopic techniques in the management of this disease. We retrospectively analyzed data from 6 patients who were diagnosed with esophageal cavernous lymphangioma by endoscopy and histologic evaluation. All patients underwent endoscopic resection of the tumor at our hospital between January 2010 and June 2011. Four male and 2 female patients, with a mean age of 48.2 ± 15.2 years (range, 35 to 77 y) with esophageal cavernous lymphangioma, who underwent endoscopy followed by endoscopic resection were included in this report. The lesions varied from 0.4 to 1.2 cm in diameter, with a mean size of 0.78 ± 0.26 cm. Endoscopy revealed dilated lymphatic channels beneath the surface epithelium of the lesion in all patients. An endoscopic ultrasound revealed that all lesions were multicystic and located in the submucosal layer. Histologic examination confirmed the initial diagnosis in all patients. Endoscopy plays an important role in the diagnosis of esophageal cavernous lymphangioma, with dilated lymphatic channels beneath the surface epithelium of the lesion being a characteristic endoscopic feature.

Intensity-modulated radiation therapy with dose-painting for pediatric sarcomas with pulmonary metastases.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2013-06-13,"We examined patterns of failure in pediatric patients with thoracic sarcoma and pulmonary metastases treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy with dose-painting (DP-IMRT). Eleven pediatric patients, five with Ewing sarcoma family tumors (ESFT) and six with rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), with primary thoracic tumors and pulmonary metastases underwent DP-IMRT with chemotherapy for definitive treatment. Eight patients also underwent surgery. Median time to RT was 21 (15-31) weeks. Nine patients received 45-50.4-Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions to the primary tumor (n = 3) or post-operative tumor bed (n = 6). Two patients ≤4 years received 12 Gy intraoperative radiation therapy and 30.6-36 Gy IMRT postoperatively to the tumor bed. All patients received 14-16.8 Gy in 0.54-0.88 Gy fractions to the whole lungs (n = 6) or hemithorax (n = 5) using dose-painting technique. A representative case was re-planned with IMRT plus standard AP/PA whole lung irradiation (WLI) for dosimetric comparison. With 27-month median follow-up, 3-year pulmonary relapse-free survival in all patients was 61%: 80% for RMS and 40% for ESFT. Five patients (4 ESFT and 1 RMS) experienced pulmonary relapse at median 16 (9-41) months. There were no local failures. Our representative case demonstrated more homogeneous target volume coverage of the whole lungs and decreased mean dose to esophagus (15%), heart (31%), spinal cord (15%), and liver (19%) with DP-IMRT.

Success of endoscopic pharyngoesophageal dilation after head and neck cancer treatment.,The Laryngoscope,Laryngoscope,2013-07-08,"To assess clinical success and safety of endoscopic pharyngoesophageal dilation after chemoradiation or radiation for head and neck cancer and to identify variables associated with dilation failure. Case series with chart review. Between 2000 and 2008, a total of 111 patients treated with chemoradiation or radiation for head and neck cancer with subsequent pharyngoesophageal stenosis requiring endoscopic dilation were identified. Patients were evaluated for endoscopic dilation technique, severity of stenosis, technical and clinical success, and intra- and postoperative complications. The Diet/GT score (range, 1-5) was utilized to measure swallow success. Variables associated with dilation failure were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. There were 271 dilations analyzed, with 42 combined antegrade retrograde dilations, 208 dilations over a guidewire, and 21 dilations without guidewire. Intraoperative patency and successful dilation of the stenotic segment was achieved in 95% of patients. A Diet/GT score of 5 (gastrostomy tube removed and soft/regular diet) was attained in 84 of 111 (76%) patients. Safety analysis showed complications occurred in 9% of all dilations. Perforations were noted in 4% of all procedures, with only two esophageal perforations requiring significant intervention. Multiple dilations were associated with an increased risk for perforations. Further logistic regression analyses revealed that the number of dilations was indicating a poor outcome and low Diet/GT score.

Retrospective review of consecutive patients with a history of GB who underwent a MIE for esophageal cancer between July 2010 and August 2012. Five patients were identified with a mean age of 57 years. Mean follow-up was 9.1 months. Four patients had undergone laparoscopic GB, and 1 patient had an open GB. Two patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy for locally advanced disease. Minimally invasive procedures were thoracoscopic/laparoscopic esophagectomy with cervical anastomosis in 4 patients and colonic interposition in 1 patient.

Association of mitochondrial DNA copy number in peripheral blood leukocytes with risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,2013-06-26,"Alterations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been associated with the risk of a number of human cancers; however, the relationship between mtDNA copy number in peripheral blood leukocytes and the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has not been reported. In this study, we determined relative mtDNA copy number in peripheral blood leukocytes of 218 EAC cases and 218 frequency-matched controls. We calculated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex and smoking status. MtDNA copy number was significantly lower in cases than in controls (mean ± SD, 1.16 ± 0.30 versus 1.27 ± 0.43, P = 0.002). Dichotomized at the median value of mtDNA copy number in the controls, low mtDNA copy number was significantly associated with an increased risk of EAC (odds ratio: 1.55, 95% confidence interval: 1.05-2.29).

Improved longitudinal length accuracy of gross tumor volume delineation with diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,"Radiation oncology (London, England)",Radiat Oncol,2013-07-06,"To analyze the longitudinal length accuracy of gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation with diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Forty-two patients from December 2011 to June 2012 with esophageal SCC who underwent radical surgery were analyzed. Routine computed tomography (CT) scan, T2-weighted MRI and diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) were employed before surgery. Diffusion-sensitive gradient b-values were taken at 400, 600, and 800 s/mm2. Gross tumor volumes (GTV) were delineated using CT, T2-weighted MRI and DWI on different b-value images. GTV longitude length measured using the imaging modalities listed above was compared with pathologic lesion length to determine the most accurate imaging modality. CMS Xio radiotherapy planning system was used to fuse DWI scans and CT images to investigate the possibility of delineating GTV on fused images. The differences between the GTV length according to CT, T2-weighted MRI and pathology were 3.63 ± 12.06 mm and 3.46 ± 11.41 mm, respectively. When the diffusion-sensitive gradient b-value was 400, 600, and 800 s/mm2, the differences between the GTV length using DWI and pathology were 0.73 ± 6.09 mm, -0.54 ± 6.03 mm and -1.58 ± 5.71 mm, respectively. DWI scans and CT images were fused accurately using the radiotherapy planning system. GTV margins were depicted clearly on fused images.

Self-expanding stent effects on radiation dosimetry in esophageal cancer.,Journal of applied clinical medical physics,J Appl Clin Med Phys,2013-07-08,"It is the purpose of this study to evaluate how self-expanding stents (SESs) affect esophageal cancer radiation planning target volumes (PTVs) and dose delivered to surrounding organs at risk (OARs). Ten patients were evaluated, for whom a SES was placed before radiation. A computed tomography (CT) scan obtained before stent placement was fused to the post-stent CT simulation scan. Three methods were used to represent pre-stent PTVs: 1) image fusion (IF), 2) volume approximation (VA), and 3) diameter approximation (DA). PTVs and OARs were contoured per RTOG 1010 protocol using Eclipse Treatment Planning software. Post-stent dosimetry for each patient was compared to approximated pre-stent dosimetry. For each of the three pre-stent approximations (IF, VA, and DA), the mean lung and liver doses and the estimated percentages of lung volumes receiving 5 Gy, 10 Gy, 20 Gy, and 30 Gy, and heart volumes receiving 40 Gy were significantly lower (p-values &lt; 0.02) than those estimated in the post-stent treatment plans. The lung V5, lung V10, and heart V40 constraints were achieved more often using our pre-stent approximations. Esophageal SES placement increases the dose delivered to the lungs, heart, and liver. This may have clinical importance, especially when the dose-volume constraints are near the recommended thresholds, as was the case for lung V5, lung V10, and heart V40. While stents have established benefits for treating patients with significant dysphagia, physicians considering stent placement and radiation therapy must realize the effects stents can have on the dosimetry.

Dependence of ventilation image derived from 4D CT on deformable image registration and ventilation algorithms.,Journal of applied clinical medical physics,J Appl Clin Med Phys,2013-07-08,"Ventilation imaging using 4D CT is a convenient and low-cost functional imaging methodology which might be of value in radiotherapy treatment planning to spare functional lung volumes. Deformable image registration (DIR) is needed to calculate ventilation imaging from 4D CT. This study investigates the dependence of calculated ventilation on DIR methods and ventilation algorithms. DIR of the normal end expiration and normal end inspiration phases of the 4D CT images was used to correlate the voxels between the two respiratory phases. Three different DIR algorithms, optical flow (OF), diffeomorphic demons (DD), and diffeomorphic morphons (DM) were retrospectively applied to ten esophagus and ten lung cancer cases with 4D CT image sets that encompassed the entire lung volume. The three ventilation extraction methods were used based on either the Jacobian, the change in volume of the voxel, or directly calculated from Hounsfield units. The ventilation calculation algorithms used are the Jacobian, ΔV, and HU method. They were compared using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) index and Bland-Altman plots. Dependence of ventilation images on the DIR was greater for the ΔV and the Jacobian methods than for the HU method. The DSC index for 20% of low-ventilation volume for ΔV was 0.33 ± 0.03 (1 SD) between OF and DM, 0.44 ± 0.05 between OF and DD, and 0.51 ± 0.04 between DM and DD. The similarity comparisons for Jacobian were 0.32 ± 0.03, 0.44 ± 0.05, and 0.51 ± 0.04, respectively, and for HU they were 0.53 ± 0.03, 0.56 ± 0.03, and 0.76 ± 0.04, respectively. Dependence of extracted ventilation on the ventilation algorithm used showed good agreement between the ΔV and Jacobian methods, but differed significantly for the HU method. DSC index for using OF as DIR was 0.86 ± 0.01 between ΔV and Jacobian, 0.28 ± 0.04 between ΔV and HU, and 0.28 ± 0.04 between Jacobian and HU, respectively. When using DM or DD as DIR, similar values were obtained when comparing the different ventilation calculation methods. The similarity values for the 20% high-ventilation volume were close to those found for the 20% low-ventilation volume. The results obtained with DSC index were confirmed when using the Bland-Altman plots for comparing the ventilation images. Our data suggest that ventilation calculated from 4D CT depends on the DIR algorithm employed. Similarities between ΔV and Jacobian are higher than between ΔV and HU, and Jacobian and HU. ",Comparative Study,2388.0,9.0,Ventilation imaging using 4D CT is a convenient and low-cost functional imaging methodology which might be of value in radiotherapy treatment planning to spare functional volumes Deformable image registration DIR is needed to calculate ventilation imaging from 4D CT This study investigates the dependence of calculated ventilation on DIR methods and ventilation algorithms DIR of the normal end expiration and normal end inspiration phases of the 4D CT images was used to correlate the voxels between the two respiratory phases Three different DIR algorithms optical flow OF diffeomorphic demons DD and diffeomorphic morphons DM were retrospectively applied to ten and ten cancer cases with 4D CT image sets that encompassed the entire volume The three ventilation extraction methods were used based on either the Jacobian the change in volume of the voxel or directly calculated from Hounsfield units The ventilation calculation algorithms used are the Jacobian ΔV and HU method They were compared using the Dice similarity coefficient DSC index and Bland-Altman plots Dependence of ventilation images on the DIR was greater for the ΔV and the Jacobian methods than for the HU method The DSC index for 20 of low-ventilation volume for ΔV was 0.33 ± 0.03 1 SD between OF and DM 0.44 ± 0.05 between OF and DD and 0.51 ± 0.04 between DM and DD The similarity comparisons for Jacobian were 0.32 ± 0.03 0.44 ± 0.05 and 0.51 ± 0.04 respectively and for HU they were 0.53 ± 0.03 0.56 ± 0.03 and 0.76 ± 0.04 respectively Dependence of extracted ventilation on the ventilation algorithm used showed good agreement between the ΔV and Jacobian methods but differed significantly for the HU method DSC index for using OF as DIR was 0.86 ± 0.01 between ΔV and Jacobian 0.28 ± 0.04 between ΔV and HU and 0.28 ± 0.04 between Jacobian and HU respectively When using DM or DD as DIR similar values were obtained when comparing the different ventilation calculation methods The similarity values for the 20 high-ventilation volume were close to those found for the 20 low-ventilation volume The results obtained with DSC index were confirmed when using the Bland-Altman plots for comparing the ventilation images Our data suggest that ventilation calculated from 4D CT depends on the DIR algorithm employed Similarities between ΔV and Jacobian are higher than between ΔV and HU and Jacobian and HU,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[7845, 270, 75, 5321, 425, 16, 8, 7048, 2, 154, 835, 583, 270, 3209, 92, 822, 40, 1, 549, 4, 310, 24, 1349, 6, 8539, 583, 2225, 10491, 1482, 3169, 8831, 16, 575, 6, 3232, 7845, 270, 29, 5321, 425, 26, 45, 7259, 3, 3721, 1, 981, 7845, 23, 8831, 636, 2, 7845, 3529, 8831, 1, 3, 295, 396, 19656, 2, 295, 396, 13104, 3523, 1, 3, 5321, 425, 1572, 10, 95, 6, 1513, 3, 8784, 59, 3, 100, 2718, 3523, 169, 338, 8831, 3529, 4303, 1412, 1, 47829, 40414, 6952, 2, 47829, 63050, 2778, 11, 894, 1498, 6, 1618, 2, 1618, 12, 140, 5, 5321, 425, 1482, 2270, 17, 9226, 3, 1797, 433, 3, 169, 7845, 5763, 636, 11, 95, 90, 23, 361, 3, 20827, 3, 707, 4, 433, 1, 3, 8400, 15, 1606, 981, 29, 16894, 2960, 3, 7845, 6333, 3529, 95, 32, 3, 20827, 21699, 2, 5948, 596, 491, 11, 72, 75, 3, 13685, 6700, 3200, 15064, 558, 2, 11150, 15322, 8030, 3721, 1, 7845, 1572, 23, 3, 8831, 10, 378, 9, 3, 21699, 2, 3, 20827, 636, 76, 9, 3, 5948, 596, 3, 15064, 558, 9, 179, 1, 154, 7845, 433, 9, 21699, 10, 13, 466, 810, 13, 680, 14, 1270, 59, 1, 2, 2778, 13, 584, 810, 13, 474, 59, 1, 2, 6952, 2, 13, 725, 810, 13, 755, 59, 2778, 2, 6952, 3, 6700, 2213, 9, 20827, 11, 13, 531, 810, 13, 680, 13, 584, 810, 13, 474, 2, 13, 725, 810, 13, 755, 106, 2, 9, 5948, 491, 11, 13, 699, 810, 13, 680, 13, 664, 810, 13, 680, 2, 13, 846, 810, 13, 755, 106, 3721, 1, 2484, 7845, 23, 3, 7845, 2124, 95, 224, 1178, 2024, 59, 3, 21699, 2, 20827, 636, 84, 2512, 97, 9, 3, 5948, 596, 15064, 558, 9, 75, 1, 22, 8831, 10, 13, 868, 810, 13, 355, 59, 21699, 2, 20827, 13, 339, 810, 13, 755, 59, 21699, 2, 5948, 2, 13, 339, 810, 13, 755, 59, 20827, 2, 5948, 106, 198, 75, 2778, 15, 6952, 22, 8831, 288, 1030, 11, 683, 198, 1430, 3, 338, 7845, 6333, 636, 3, 6700, 1030, 9, 3, 179, 64, 7845, 433, 11, 2336, 6, 135, 204, 9, 3, 179, 154, 7845, 433, 3, 99, 683, 5, 15064, 558, 11, 557, 198, 75, 3, 11150, 15322, 8030, 9, 1430, 3, 7845, 1572, 114, 74, 309, 17, 7845, 981, 29, 5321, 425, 3828, 23, 3, 8831, 2124, 2516, 6089, 59, 21699, 2, 20827, 32, 142, 76, 59, 21699, 2, 5948, 2, 20827, 2, 5948]",2381.0,23835389,74
A dual mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibitor shows antitumor activity in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells and sensitizes them to cisplatin.,Anti-cancer drugs,Anticancer Drugs,2013-10-01,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is critical for the growth and proliferation of various malignant tumors, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Therefore, targeting of mTOR protein is a promising strategy for therapy in this disease. In the present study, we examined the antitumor effects of a specific mTOR kinase inhibitor, PP242, which blocks both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) pathways, in two ESCC cell lines: Eca-109 and TE-1. We showed that PP242, but not rapamycin, attenuated the activities of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling in ESCC. PP242 inhibited 4E-binding protein-1 phosphorylation and abrogated mTORC1-dependent PI3K/Akt feedback activation. Significantly, PP242 effectively suppressed ESCC cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and arrested the cell cycle. Furthermore, PP242 promoted cisplatin-induced apoptosis and enhanced the antitumor efficacy of cisplatin in ESCC cells, which was likely to be associated with inhibition of Akt activity. Our results show that simultaneous targeting of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathways leads to effective antitumor actions in ESCC, and strongly suggest that dual mTORC1/2 inhibitors should be developed as potential agents for the treatment of ESCC.",Journal Article,2303.0,19.0,The mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR signaling pathway is critical for the growth and proliferation of various malignant tumors including squamous cell carcinoma ESCC Therefore targeting of mTOR protein is a promising strategy for therapy in this disease In the present study we examined the antitumor effects of a specific mTOR kinase inhibitor PP242 which blocks both mTOR complex 1 mTORC1 and mTOR complex 2 mTORC2 pathways in two ESCC cell lines Eca-109 and TE-1 We showed that PP242 but not rapamycin attenuated the activities of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling in ESCC PP242 inhibited 4E-binding protein-1 phosphorylation and abrogated mTORC1-dependent PI3K/Akt feedback activation Significantly PP242 effectively suppressed ESCC cell proliferation induced apoptosis and arrested the cell cycle Furthermore PP242 promoted cisplatin-induced apoptosis and enhanced the antitumor efficacy of cisplatin in ESCC cells which was likely to be associated with inhibition of Akt activity Our results show that simultaneous targeting of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathways leads to effective antitumor actions in ESCC and strongly suggest that dual mTORC1/2 inhibitors should be developed as potential agents for the treatment of ESCC,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[3, 2359, 283, 1, 1620, 873, 314, 308, 16, 740, 9, 3, 129, 2, 457, 1, 747, 393, 57, 141, 691, 31, 134, 5681, 673, 529, 1, 873, 178, 16, 8, 721, 692, 9, 36, 4, 26, 34, 4, 3, 364, 45, 21, 409, 3, 579, 176, 1, 8, 112, 873, 216, 230, 16525, 92, 2860, 110, 873, 840, 14, 5023, 2, 873, 840, 18, 8550, 460, 4, 100, 5681, 31, 285, 25542, 3486, 2, 6917, 14, 21, 224, 17, 16525, 84, 44, 1620, 2656, 3, 2042, 1, 110, 5023, 2, 8550, 314, 4, 5681, 16525, 879, 6726, 791, 178, 14, 982, 2, 3728, 5023, 470, 974, 649, 3983, 363, 97, 16525, 1856, 1908, 5681, 31, 457, 277, 351, 2, 9762, 3, 31, 417, 798, 16525, 2992, 540, 277, 351, 2, 651, 3, 579, 209, 1, 540, 4, 5681, 37, 92, 10, 322, 6, 40, 41, 5, 297, 1, 649, 128, 114, 99, 514, 17, 2824, 529, 1, 110, 5023, 2, 8550, 460, 1940, 6, 323, 579, 5592, 4, 5681, 2, 1327, 309, 17, 1828, 5023, 18, 222, 257, 40, 276, 22, 174, 183, 9, 3, 24, 1, 5681]",1229.0,23838676,136
Predictors of postoperative complications after trimodality therapy for esophageal cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2013-08-01,"While trimodality therapy for esophageal cancer has improved patient outcomes, surgical complication rates remain high. The goal of this study was to identify modifiable factors associated with postoperative complications after neoadjuvant chemoradiation. From 1998 to 2011, 444 patients were treated at our institution with surgical resection after chemoradiation. Postoperative (pulmonary, gastrointestinal [GI], cardiac, wound healing) complications were recorded up to 30 days postoperatively. Kruskal-Wallis tests and χ(2) or Fisher exact tests were used to assess associations between continuous and categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression tested the association between perioperative complications and patient or treatment factors that were significant on univariate analysis. The most frequent postoperative complications after trimodality therapy were pulmonary (25%) and GI (23%). Lung capacity and the type of radiation modality used were independent predictors of pulmonary and GI complications. After adjusting for confounding factors, pulmonary and GI complications were increased in patients treated with 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) versus intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT; odds ratio [OR], 2.018; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.104-3.688; OR, 1.704; 95% CI, 1.03-2.82, respectively) and for patients treated with 3D-CRT versus proton beam therapy (PBT; OR, 3.154; 95% CI, 1.365-7.289; OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 0.78-3.08, respectively). Mean lung radiation dose (MLD) was strongly associated with pulmonary complications, and the differences in toxicities seen for the radiation modalities could be fully accounted for by the MLD delivered by each of the modalities.

Erlotinib and radiation therapy for elderly patients with esophageal cancer - clinical and correlative results from a prospective multicenter phase 2 trial.,Oncology,Oncology,2013-07-10,"Elderly patients with esophageal cancer who are not candidates for chemoradiation may benefit from targeted agents; hence erlotinib combined with radiotherapy was evaluated in this trial. Patients >65 years with carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus or gastroesophageal junction who were not eligible for platinum-based treatment received erlotinib daily for 1 year starting on day 1 of radiotherapy [50.4 Gy days 1-28 (Mon-Fri) at 1.8 Gy per fraction]. Response was assessed by endoscopy and computed tomography. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and secondary endpoints were complete response, progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicity. The ECOG performance status in the 17 study patients was 0,1 and 2 in 2, 12 and 3 patients, respectively; 1, 5, 7 and 4 patients were in stage I, II, III and IV, respectively; adenocarcinoma was noted in 16 patients and squamous cell carcinoma in 1; there were 3 current, 12 past and 2 never smokers. Median OS was 7.3 months (95% confidence interval, CI: 3.8-22.3) with 14 deaths. There were 2 mucosal complete responses, 1 residual carcinoma in situ and 3 partial endoscopic responses in 9 patients who had endoscopy after radiotherapy. Estimated PFS was 4.5 months (95% CI: 2.4-7.3). Progression was distant (n = 3), locoregional (n = 6), unknown (n = 5) and too early (n = 3).

Propensity-based matching between esophagogastric cancer patients who had surgery and who declined surgery after preoperative chemoradiation.,Oncology,Oncology,2013-07-16,"Trimodality therapy (TMT; chemoradiation plus surgery) has level-1 evidence for survival advantage for TMT-eligible esophagogastric cancer patients. Some patients, however, decline surgery after preoperative chemoradiation. The question of which patient should have esophagectomy and which one should not is unlikely to be answered by a prospective comparison; therefore, we matched the clinical covariates of several patients who had surgery with those who declined surgery (DS). Between 2002 and 2011, we identified 623 patients in our databases. Of 623 patients, 244 patients had TMT and 61 TMT-eligible patients were in the DS group. Using the propensity-score method, we matched 16 covariates between 36 DS patients and 36 TMT patients. Baseline characteristics between the two groups were balanced (p = NS).

First, in N0747, patients were assigned to sunitinib and capecitabine versus capecitabine; 53 chemotherapy cycles were prescribed to this 12-patient cohort. Nearly all patients denoted that they ""always or almost always"" took their pills as prescribed, and two patients who reported lack of full adherence suffered from grade 3+ adverse events. Surprisingly, however, over 14 cycles, 9 patients reported grade 3+ toxicity but checked ""always or almost always"" to describe their adherence. No relationships were observed between adherence and cancer outcomes. Secondly, 21 articles identified the following adherence tools: (1) healthcare providers' interviews, (2) patient-reported adherence with diaries/calendars, (3) patient-completed adherence scales, (4) medication event monitoring, (5) automated voice response, (6) drug/metabolite assays, and (7) prescription databases.

We hypothesize that higher level of radiation-induced γ-H2AX in PBLs may be associated with an increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Laser scanning cytometer-based immunocytochemical method was used to measure baseline and irradiation-induced γ-H2AX levels in PBLs from 211 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma and 211 healthy controls. The ratio of induced γ-H2AX level to baseline level was used to evaluate individual susceptibility to DSBs. Relative risks for esophageal adenocarcinoma associated with γ-H2AX were assessed by multivariable logistic regression analysis. Radiation-induced γ-H2AX level and the γ-H2AX ratio were significantly higher in cases than in controls. Dichotomized at the median in controls, a significantly increased risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma was observed in association with high γ-H2AX ratio [OR = 2.94; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.83-4.72]. Quartile analyses showed significant dose-response associations between higher γ-H2AX ratio and increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma (Ptrend, 1.64E-06). In addition, joint effect between γ-H2AX ratio and smoking was observed: smokers who had high γ-H2AX ratio exhibited the highest risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma (OR = 5.53; 95% CI, 2.71-11.25) compared with never smokers with low γ-H2AX ratio. Radiation-induced DNA damage assessed by γ-H2AX ratio is associated with an increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. γ-H2AX assay is a new and robust method to measure DSB damage in PBLs, which can be used to assess mutagen sensitivity and esophageal adenocarcinoma risk.",Journal Article,2365.0,9.0,Mutagen-induced DNA damage as measured in peripheral blood lymphocytes PBL has been associated with increased risks of cancers The formation of γ-H2AX is an early cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks DSB We hypothesize that higher level of radiation-induced γ-H2AX in PBLs may be associated with an increased risk of adenocarcinoma Laser scanning cytometer-based immunocytochemical method was used to measure baseline and irradiation-induced γ-H2AX levels in PBLs from 211 patients with adenocarcinoma and 211 healthy controls The ratio of induced γ-H2AX level to baseline level was used to evaluate individual susceptibility to DSBs Relative risks for adenocarcinoma associated with γ-H2AX were assessed by multivariable logistic regression analysis Radiation-induced γ-H2AX level and the γ-H2AX ratio were significantly higher in cases than in controls Dichotomized at the median in controls a significantly increased risk for adenocarcinoma was observed in association with high γ-H2AX ratio OR 2.94 95 confidence interval CI 1.83-4.72 Quartile analyses showed significant dose-response associations between higher γ-H2AX ratio and increased risk of adenocarcinoma Ptrend 1.64E-06 In addition joint effect between γ-H2AX ratio and smoking was observed smokers who had high γ-H2AX ratio exhibited the highest risk of adenocarcinoma OR 5.53 95 CI 2.71-11.25 compared with never smokers with low γ-H2AX ratio Radiation-induced DNA damage assessed by γ-H2AX ratio is associated with an increased risk of adenocarcinoma γ-H2AX assay is a new and robust method to measure DSB damage in PBLs which can be used to assess mutagen sensitivity and adenocarcinoma risk,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[11491, 277, 261, 1350, 22, 644, 4, 672, 315, 1594, 6172, 71, 85, 41, 5, 101, 1098, 1, 163, 3, 1264, 1, 2655, 6286, 16, 35, 191, 763, 51, 6, 261, 1627, 4787, 4492, 8414, 21, 4919, 17, 142, 301, 1, 121, 277, 2655, 6286, 4, 11579, 68, 40, 41, 5, 35, 101, 43, 1, 449, 3555, 3702, 23187, 90, 16217, 596, 10, 95, 6, 1463, 330, 2, 1104, 277, 2655, 6286, 148, 4, 11579, 29, 5905, 7, 5, 449, 2, 5905, 1331, 535, 3, 197, 1, 277, 2655, 6286, 301, 6, 330, 301, 10, 95, 6, 376, 797, 1432, 6, 9523, 580, 1098, 9, 449, 41, 5, 2655, 6286, 11, 275, 20, 658, 812, 320, 65, 121, 277, 2655, 6286, 301, 2, 3, 2655, 6286, 197, 11, 97, 142, 4, 140, 76, 4, 535, 6701, 28, 3, 52, 4, 535, 8, 97, 101, 43, 9, 449, 10, 164, 4, 248, 5, 64, 2655, 6286, 197, 15, 18, 960, 48, 307, 268, 58, 14, 852, 39, 720, 3708, 318, 224, 93, 61, 51, 685, 59, 142, 2655, 6286, 197, 2, 101, 43, 1, 449, 6197, 14, 63163, 1460, 4, 352, 2093, 254, 59, 2655, 6286, 197, 2, 979, 10, 164, 1485, 54, 42, 64, 2655, 6286, 197, 1416, 3, 1076, 43, 1, 449, 15, 33, 699, 48, 58, 18, 792, 175, 243, 72, 5, 1737, 1485, 5, 154, 2655, 6286, 197, 121, 277, 261, 1350, 275, 20, 2655, 6286, 197, 16, 41, 5, 35, 101, 43, 1, 449, 2655, 6286, 719, 16, 8, 217, 2, 1922, 596, 6, 1463, 8414, 1350, 4, 11579, 92, 122, 40, 95, 6, 423, 11491, 485, 2, 449, 43]",1668.0,23904462,153

Small cell carcinoma of the esophagus: a SEER database analysis.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg.

We examined the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to identify prognostic factors for survival. All patients with esophageal cancer in the SEER database between 1973 and 2009 were included. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed in patients with and without SCC, examining the relationship of small cell histology, surgery, and other potential prognostic factors with overall survival (censored at 72 months). Of 64,799 esophageal cancer patients identified in the SEER database, 387 (0.6 %) had small cell histology. As compared with non-small cell histology, patients with small cell histology were similar in age and race but had a higher proportion of women (p < 0.001), had a higher stage at diagnosis (p < 0.001), and were less likely to undergo surgical resection (p < 0.01). Multivariate predictors associated with poor survival in the overall cohort included age, female gender, black race, and stage. In patients treated with surgery, multivariate predictors associated with poor survival included age, male gender, race, and stage but not small cell histology. In patients with small cell histology, both age and stage were associated with poor survival, but surgery and preoperative radiotherapy were associated with improved survival.

Pretreatment patient comorbidity and tobacco use increase cost and risk of postoperative complications after esophagectomy at a high-volume cancer center.,Journal of oncology practice,J Oncol Pract,2013-07-29,"Understanding the mechanisms and drivers of cost is a key component of improving the value of cancer care at both the system and patient level. Previous research on the cost of esophagectomy has established important postoperative drivers of cost; however, no study has linked pretreatment patient characteristics with cost. We sought to identify pretreatment patient characteristics that increase inpatient cost, length of stay, and risk of anastomotic leak and major pulmonary event (MPE) after esophagectomy for locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma. We identified 191 patients with locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma treated with trimodality therapy at our institution between January 2002 and December 2008. All patients underwent espophagectomy 6 to 8 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant therapy. Multiple linear regression models were used to identify pretreatment predictors of total cost and length of stay. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify pretreatment factors associated with leak and MPE. Pretreatment comorbidity (β=0.1215, P=.039) and history of tobacco use (β=0.0022, P=.028) significantly increased cost of esophagectomy. A comorbid condition increased total cost by 12.9%. Comorbidity (β=0.2597, P=.001) and poor performance status (β=0.1514, P=.021) were also significantly associated with prolonged length of stay. Patients with a higher comorbidity score had an increased risk of anastomotic leak (odds ratio, 6.564; 95% CI, 1.676 to 25.716) and MPE (odds ratio, 2.732; 95% CI, 1.317 to 5.666).

Should patients with extrapulmonary small-cell carcinoma receive prophylactic cranial irradiation?,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2013-09-01,"Extrapulmonary small-cell carcinoma (EPSCC) is a rare disease. Management is based on small-cell lung carcinoma. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is not routinely administered in EPSCC. This study investigates the role of PCI in EPSCC, by analyzing the incidence, treatment, and survival of patients with brain metastases in a national cohort. Disease biology and epidemiology are also investigated. Patients diagnosed with primary EPSCC from the National Cancer Registry of Ireland from 1995 to 2007 were identified. The number of patients who developed brain metastases, their survival, and treatment data were documented. Patients who received PCI were investigated. Patient and disease characteristics, treatment, and survival data were stratified by stage and primary site. Two hundred eighty patients were identified; 141 (50.4%) were men and 139 (49.6%) were women. One hundred eighty six patients (66.4%) had extensive-stage disease, 65 (23.2%) had limited-stage disease, and in 29 patients (10.3%) the stage was unknown. Eighteen patients (6.4%) developed brain metastases, with a median overall survival of 10.1 months. Eleven (61%) received cranial irradiation, and 12 (67%) received palliative chemotherapy. Two patients in the entire cohort (0.17%) received PCI. The most common primary sites included the esophagus (n = 43; 15.4%), cervix uteri (n = 17; 6.0%), bladder (n = 13; 4.6%), and prostate (n = 10; 3.6%).

Genome-wide methylation analysis shows similar patterns in Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma.,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,2013-08-29,"Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a precursor of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). To identify novel tumor suppressors involved in esophageal carcinogenesis and potential biomarkers for the malignant progression of BE, we performed a genome-wide methylation profiling of BE and EAC tissues. Using Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip microarray, we examined the methylation status of 27 578 CpG sites in 94 normal esophageal (NE), 77 BE and 117 EAC tissue samples. The overall methylation of CpG sites within the CpG islands was higher, but outside of the CpG islands was lower in BE and EAC tissues than in NE tissues. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed an excellent separation of NE tissues from BE and EAC tissues; however, the clustering of BE and EAC tissues was less clear, suggesting that methylation occurs early during the progression of EAC. We confirmed many previously reported hypermethylated genes and identified a large number of novel hypermethylated genes in BE and EAC tissues, particularly genes encoding ADAM (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase) peptidase proteins, cadherins and protocadherins, and potassium voltage-gated channels. Pathway analysis showed that a number of channel and transporter activities were enriched for hypermethylated genes. We used pyrosequencing to validate selected candidate genes and found high correlations between the array and pyrosequencing data (rho > 0.8 for each validated gene). The differentially methylated genes and pathways may provide biological insights into the development and progression of BE and become potential biomarkers for the prediction and early detection of EAC.

"Gastroesophageal cancer: focus on epidemiology, classification, and staging.",Discovery medicine,Discov Med,2013-09-01,"Gastroesophageal cancer (GEC), comprising proximal esophagogastric junction (EGJ) and distal gastric cancer (GC), is a significant public health concern. The epidemiology of these tumors has significantly changed over the past several decades especially in developed countries. There is a recognized decrease in incidence and mortality of distal GC and an increase in incidence and mortality of proximal EGJ cancer. The changing epidemiology is thought to be mainly due to changing trends of risk factors such as lower incidence of Helicobacter pylori infection and increasing incidence of obesity and gastroesophageal reflux. Histologically, EGJ cancers are adenocarcinoma (AC), while distal esophagus may be squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or AC. Distal GC is predominantly AC. Following anatomical and histological distinction, tumors are staged with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), computerized tomography (CT), and often positron emission tomography (PET) with or without diagnostic laparoscopic and peritoneal washing. Accurate staging of tumors, with emphasis on excluding occult metastasis, is imperative to avoid unnecessary surgical resection. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how these tumors are classified, the associated epidemiology, and the current standards of staging prior to selecting the appropriate course of therapy. In this review we will discuss the epidemiology, classification, and staging of locally advanced GEC.

Intensity modulated radiotherapy for stage III non-small cell lung cancer in the United States: predictors of use and association with toxicities.,"Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",Lung Cancer,2013-08-21,"Intensity modulated radiotherapy for stage III lung cancer has become commonplace in the United States in the absence of randomized controlled trials. We used a large, population-based database to determine which factors led to increased utilization of IMRT and to evaluate associations of IMRT with toxicities. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare records identified 3986 individuals aged 66 years or older diagnosed with stage III lung cancer between 2001 and 2007 and treated with IMRT or 3D conformal radiotherapy. Predictors of IMRT use were determined using logistic regression. Associations of IMRT use with diagnosis codes for radiation-related toxicities were evaluated with multivariate proportional hazards regression and propensity-score matching. Among the 3986 patients studied, the median age was 75 years, 54.1% were male, and 62% had IIIA disease. Two hundred and fifty seven (6.5%) patients received IMRT, with use increasing from 0.5% in 2001 to 14.7% in 2007 (P < 0.001). Key predictors of IMRT delivery included increasing year of diagnosis and treatment in a freestanding center (odds ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.59-2.77, P < 0.001); tumor size, stage, and number of radiotherapy fractions delivered were not associated with IMRT use.

The influence of histopathologic tumor viability on long-term survival and recurrence rates following neoadjuvant therapy for esophageal adenocarcinoma.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2013-09-01,"Our aim was to validate the effect of histopathologic tumor viability (HTV) on extended survival outcomes and assess the prognostic ability of the current staging system in patients receiving preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT). The American Joint Committee on Cancer, 7th Edition, esophageal carcinoma staging system is derived from patients treated with surgery alone and does not account for the treatment effect of CRT. The extent of HTV after CRT is based on response to neoadjuvant therapy and has been shown to correlate with patient outcome. Medical records of 1278 patients who underwent esophagectomy (1990-2011) were reviewed; 784 patients underwent preoperative CRT. Histologic tumor viability was assessed in 602 patients and classified as 0% to 10%, 11% to 50%, and more than 50%. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method at potential median follow-up of 67 months. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified variables associated with survival. Multivariate analysis identified HTV of greater than 50% (P < 0.001, HR 2.5), positive pathologic nodal status (P < 0.001, HR 1.6), and positive clinical nodal status (P = 0.002, HR 1.5) but not pathologic T status (P = 0.816, HR 1.2) to be independently associated with survival. Actuarial 5- and 10-year survival was 52% and 43% (HTV of 0%-10%), 45% and 33% (HTV of 11%-50%), and 16% for both (HTV of >50%). The best 5-year survival 56% was achieved in N0 patients with HTV of 0% to 10% (P = 0.056, HR 1.0), contrary to 6% observed in node-positive patients with HTV of greater than 50% (P < 0.001, HR 3.1). Patients with HTV of greater than 50% demonstrated distant recurrence more frequently than those with HTV of less than 50% (51% vs 33%, P = 0.010, OR: 2.2) CONCLUSIONS:: After preoperative chemoradiation, long-term outcomes of esophageal carcinoma are best predicted utilizing histologic tumor viability; HTV may be a practical early endpoint predicting efficacy of therapy.",Evaluation Study,2333.0,21.0,Our aim was to validate the effect of histopathologic tumor viability HTV on extended survival outcomes and assess the prognostic ability of the current staging system in patients receiving preoperative chemoradiotherapy CRT The American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th Edition carcinoma staging system is derived from patients treated with surgery alone and does not account for the treatment effect of CRT The extent of HTV after CRT is based on response to neoadjuvant therapy and has been shown to correlate with patient outcome Medical records of 1278 patients who underwent esophagectomy 1990-2011 were reviewed 784 patients underwent preoperative CRT Histologic tumor viability was assessed in 602 patients and classified as 0 to 10 11 to 50 and more than 50 Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method at potential median follow-up of 67 months Univariate and multivariate analyses identified variables associated with survival Multivariate analysis identified HTV of greater than 50 P 0.001 HR 2.5 positive pathologic nodal status P 0.001 HR 1.6 and positive clinical nodal status P 0.002 HR 1.5 but not pathologic T status P 0.816 HR 1.2 to be independently associated with survival Actuarial 5- and 10-year survival was 52 and 43 HTV of 0 -10 45 and 33 HTV of 11 -50 and 16 for both HTV of 50 The best 5-year survival 56 was achieved in N0 patients with HTV of 0 to 10 P 0.056 HR 1.0 contrary to 6 observed in node-positive patients with HTV of greater than 50 P 0.001 HR 3.1 Patients with HTV of greater than 50 demonstrated distant recurrence more frequently than those with HTV of less than 50 51 vs 33 P 0.010 OR 2.2 CONCLUSIONS After preoperative chemoradiation long-term outcomes of carcinoma are best predicted utilizing histologic tumor viability HTV may be a practical early endpoint predicting efficacy of therapy,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[114, 1130, 10, 6, 2183, 3, 254, 1, 2630, 30, 2120, 18673, 23, 1747, 25, 123, 2, 423, 3, 177, 801, 1, 3, 291, 632, 398, 4, 7, 357, 498, 1464, 1089, 3, 597, 2093, 2002, 23, 12, 7283, 3580, 134, 632, 398, 16, 526, 29, 7, 73, 5, 152, 279, 2, 1097, 44, 1967, 9, 3, 24, 254, 1, 1089, 3, 1039, 1, 18673, 50, 1089, 16, 90, 23, 51, 6, 536, 36, 2, 71, 85, 443, 6, 1513, 5, 69, 228, 484, 1064, 1, 47926, 7, 54, 208, 3617, 2289, 1132, 11, 446, 14395, 7, 208, 498, 1089, 884, 30, 2120, 10, 275, 4, 10588, 7, 2, 1373, 22, 13, 6, 79, 175, 6, 212, 2, 80, 76, 212, 25, 10, 661, 75, 3, 876, 882, 596, 28, 174, 52, 166, 126, 1, 598, 53, 880, 2, 331, 318, 108, 682, 41, 5, 25, 331, 65, 108, 18673, 1, 378, 76, 212, 19, 13, 144, 168, 18, 33, 109, 510, 779, 156, 19, 13, 144, 168, 14, 49, 2, 109, 38, 779, 156, 19, 13, 1111, 168, 14, 33, 84, 44, 510, 102, 156, 19, 13, 11501, 168, 14, 18, 6, 40, 1042, 41, 5, 25, 2361, 33, 2, 79, 111, 25, 10, 653, 2, 601, 18673, 1, 13, 79, 512, 2, 466, 18673, 1, 175, 212, 2, 245, 9, 110, 18673, 1, 212, 3, 824, 33, 111, 25, 664, 10, 513, 4, 3394, 7, 5, 18673, 1, 13, 6, 79, 19, 13, 9556, 168, 14, 13, 7194, 6, 49, 164, 4, 289, 109, 7, 5, 18673, 1, 378, 76, 212, 19, 13, 144, 168, 27, 14, 7, 5, 18673, 1, 378, 76, 212, 264, 626, 146, 80, 746, 76, 135, 5, 18673, 1, 299, 76, 212, 725, 105, 466, 19, 13, 4873, 15, 18, 18, 2130, 50, 498, 975, 319, 337, 123, 1, 134, 32, 824, 783, 2600, 884, 30, 2120, 18673, 68, 40, 8, 3320, 191, 1138, 1434, 209, 1, 36]",1841.0,24022442,1

About 708 patients underwent surgery during the reviewed period, where 269 (38%) had non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 106 (15%) breast cancer (BC), 72 (10%) gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, 88 (12%) renal cell cancer (RCC), and 88 (12%) melanoma. The most notable differences were that NSCLC patients were older, BC younger, BC had more primary tumor control, and NSCLC less extracranial spread. BC had longer survival, RCC had longer local progression free survival (PFS), and NSCLC had longer distal PFS. The factors independently associated with survival for NSCLC (female, recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class, primary tumor control, solitary metastasis, tumor size, adenocarcinoma, radiation, discharge to home), BC (age, no skull base involvement, radiation), GI cancer (age, RPA class, Karnofsky performance scale (KPS), lack of preoperative motor deficit, non-esophageal tumors, non-hemorrhagic tumors, avoidance of new deficits), melanoma (preoperative seizures, solitary metastasis, smaller tumor size, discharge to home, chemotherapy), and RCC (KPS, chemotherapy) were distinctly different.

Comparative morbidity and mortality from cervical or thoracic esophageal anastomoses.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2013-09-21,"In the modern era of esophagectomy, we hypothesized that perioperative morbidity and mortality from cervical or thoracic sites of anastomoses would not be different. We used the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database to identify patients who underwent esophagectomy for lower esophageal or gastroesophageal (GE) junction malignancies from 2005 to 2010. Patients were categorized as having either a cervical or thoracic anastomosis based on CPT codes. There were 601 (66%) cervical and 308 (34%) thoracic anastomoses. Cervical anastomoses were associated with greater than 2 units of blood transfusion in a higher proportion of patients (10% vs. 3%, P = 0.001), and higher superficial surgical site infections (13% vs. 7%, P = 0.003). There were no difference in rates of organ/space infections (6% vs. 7%, P = 0.70), overall morbidity (38% vs. 39%, P = 0.84), or mortality (3% vs. 4%, P = 0.34).

Our aim is to evaluate the outcomes and the volume-outcomes relationship associated with postoperative infections following resection of common solid tumors. We used Texas Discharge Data to study patients undergoing resection of cancer of the lung, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, colon, or rectum from 01/2002 to 11/2006. From their billing records, we identified ICD-9 codes indicating a diagnosis of serious postoperative infection (SPI), i.e., bacteremia/sepsis, pneumonia, and wound infection, occurring during surgical admission or leading to readmission within 30 days of surgery. Using regression-based techniques, we estimated the impact of SPI on mortality, resource utilization, and costs, as well as the relationship between hospital volume and SPI, after adjusting for confounders and data clustering. SPI occurred following 9.4 % of the 37,582 eligible tumor resections and was independently associated with nearly 12-fold increased odds of in-hospital mortality [95 % confidence interval (95 % CI), 7.2-19.5, P < 0.001]. Patients with SPI required six additional hospital days (95 % CI, 5.9-6.2) at an incremental cost of $16,991 (95 % CI, $16,495-$17,497). Patients who underwent resection at high-volume hospitals had a 16 % decreased odds of developing SPI than those at low-volume hospitals (P = 0.03). Due to the substantial burden associated with SPI following common solid tumor resections, hospitals must identify more effective prophylactic measures to avert these potentially preventable infections.

Locoregional failure rate after preoperative chemoradiation of esophageal adenocarcinoma and the outcomes of salvage strategies.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2013-10-21,"The primary purpose of surveillance of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and/or esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma after local therapy (eg, chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery or trimodality therapy [TMT]) is to implement a potentially beneficial salvage therapy to overcome possible morbidity/mortality caused by locoregional failure (LRF). However, the benefits of surveillance are not well understood. We report on LRFs and salvage strategies in a large cohort. Between 2000 and 2010, 518 patients with EAC who completed TMT were analyzed for the frequency of LRF over time and salvage therapy outcomes. Standard statistical techniques were used. For 518 patients, the median follow-up time was 29.3 months (range, 1 to 149 months). Distant metastases (with or without LRF) occurred in 188 patients (36%), and LRF only occurred in 27 patients (5%). Eleven of 27 patients had lumen-only LRF. Most LRFs (89%) occurred within 36 months of surgery. Twelve patients had salvage chemoradiotherapy, but only five survived more than 2 years. Four patients needed salvage surgery, and three who survived more than 2 years developed distant metastases. The median overall survival of 27 patients with LRF was 17 months, and 10 patients (37%) survived more than 2 years. Thus, only 2% of all 518 patients benefited from surveillance/salvage strategies.

HER-2/neu gene amplification in relation to expression of HER2 and HER3 proteins in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2013-10-21,"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a therapeutic target in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), with gene amplification used as a selection criterion for treatment, although to the authors' knowledge the concordance between amplification and HER2 protein expression remains undefined in EAC. Furthermore, the association between HER2 and its interacting partner, human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3), is unknown yet appears to be of potential therapeutic relevance. Patients with untreated EACs (N = 673) were analyzed for HER2 amplification and polysomy 17 by fluorescence in situ hybridization in parallel with immunohistochemistry (IHC) (IHC scores of 0-1+, 2+, and 3+). Amplification was defined as HER2/CEP17 ≥ 2. HER3 expression by IHC was analyzed in randomly selected cases (n = 224). IHC and fluorescence in situ hybridization results were compared using least squares linear regression. Overall, 17% of the EACs (116 of 673 EACs) were HER2-amplified with an amplification frequency that was highest among IHC3+ cases (89%) and declined among IHC2+ cases (13%) and IHC0 to IHC1+ cases (4%). Among HER2-amplified cases, the level of amplification increased linearly with HER2 membranous expression (HER2/CEP17 ratio: 7.9 in IHC3+ and 5.5 in IHC2+ vs 2.8 in IHC0 to IHC1+ [P < .0001]), with 14% of amplified tumors demonstrating absent/faint expression (IHC0 to IHC1+). Polysomy 17 was not found to be associated with HER2 expression. Cytoplasmic HER3 expression was detected in 87% of tumors (195 of 224 tumors) and was found to be significantly associated with better differentiation (P < .0001). Stepwise increases in HER3 expression were associated with higher HER2 expression levels (P = .0019). Levels of HER2 protein expression and amplification were found to be linearly associated and highly concordant. Among amplified tumors with absent/faint expression, the level of amplification was low. Frequent expression of HER3 suggests its relevance as a therapeutic target, and its significant association with HER2 supports ongoing efforts to inhibit HER2/HER3 in patients with EAC.",Journal Article,2283.0,19.0,Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 HER2 is a therapeutic target in patients with adenocarcinoma EAC with gene amplification used as a selection criterion for treatment although to the authors knowledge the concordance between amplification and HER2 protein expression remains undefined in EAC Furthermore the association between HER2 and its interacting partner human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 HER3 is unknown yet appears to be of potential therapeutic relevance Patients with untreated EACs N 673 were analyzed for HER2 amplification and polysomy 17 by fluorescence in situ hybridization in parallel with immunohistochemistry IHC IHC scores of 0-1+ 2+ and 3+ Amplification was defined as HER2/CEP17 ≥ 2 HER3 expression by IHC was analyzed in randomly selected cases n 224 IHC and fluorescence in situ hybridization results were compared using least squares linear regression Overall 17 of the EACs 116 of 673 EACs were HER2-amplified with an amplification frequency that was highest among IHC3+ cases 89 and declined among IHC2+ cases 13 and IHC0 to IHC1+ cases 4 Among HER2-amplified cases the level of amplification increased linearly with HER2 membranous expression HER2/CEP17 ratio 7.9 in IHC3+ and 5.5 in IHC2+ vs 2.8 in IHC0 to IHC1+ P .0001 with 14 of amplified tumors demonstrating absent/faint expression IHC0 to IHC1+ Polysomy 17 was not found to be associated with HER2 expression Cytoplasmic HER3 expression was detected in 87 of tumors 195 of 224 tumors and was found to be significantly associated with better differentiation P .0001 Stepwise increases in HER3 expression were associated with higher HER2 expression levels P .0019 Levels of HER2 protein expression and amplification were found to be linearly associated and highly concordant Among amplified tumors with absent/faint expression the level of amplification was low Frequent expression of HER3 suggests its relevance as a therapeutic target and its significant association with HER2 supports ongoing efforts to inhibit HER2/HER3 in patients with EAC,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[171, 829, 129, 161, 153, 18, 354, 16, 8, 189, 283, 4, 7, 5, 449, 3378, 5, 145, 1073, 95, 22, 8, 881, 4643, 9, 24, 242, 6, 3, 738, 922, 3, 1827, 59, 1073, 2, 354, 178, 55, 469, 5425, 4, 3378, 798, 3, 248, 59, 354, 2, 211, 5505, 4852, 171, 829, 129, 161, 153, 27, 4885, 16, 860, 1145, 1233, 6, 40, 1, 174, 189, 2088, 7, 5, 1278, 15338, 78, 14267, 11, 311, 9, 354, 1073, 2, 5882, 269, 20, 1591, 4, 957, 1554, 4, 2755, 5, 888, 1289, 1289, 703, 1, 13, 14, 18, 2, 27, 1073, 10, 395, 22, 354, 10032, 749, 18, 4885, 55, 20, 1289, 10, 311, 4, 1108, 715, 140, 78, 5908, 1289, 2, 1591, 4, 957, 1554, 99, 11, 72, 75, 506, 11938, 1646, 320, 63, 269, 1, 3, 15338, 3790, 1, 14267, 15338, 11, 354, 2429, 5, 35, 1073, 675, 17, 10, 1076, 107, 39869, 140, 887, 2, 3054, 107, 29241, 140, 233, 2, 32138, 6, 32139, 140, 39, 107, 354, 2429, 140, 3, 301, 1, 1073, 101, 9853, 5, 354, 6300, 55, 354, 10032, 197, 67, 83, 4, 39869, 2, 33, 33, 4, 29241, 105, 18, 66, 4, 32138, 6, 32139, 19, 488, 5, 213, 1, 2429, 57, 2219, 3269, 24755, 55, 32138, 6, 32139, 5882, 269, 10, 44, 204, 6, 40, 41, 5, 354, 55, 2828, 4885, 55, 10, 530, 4, 912, 1, 57, 5786, 1, 5908, 57, 2, 10, 204, 6, 40, 97, 41, 5, 380, 910, 19, 488, 5497, 1106, 4, 4885, 55, 11, 41, 5, 142, 354, 55, 148, 19, 12960, 148, 1, 354, 178, 55, 2, 1073, 11, 204, 6, 40, 9853, 41, 2, 561, 3610, 107, 2429, 57, 5, 3269, 24755, 55, 3, 301, 1, 1073, 10, 154, 908, 55, 1, 4885, 844, 211, 2088, 22, 8, 189, 283, 2, 211, 93, 248, 5, 354, 2304, 942, 1413, 6, 1433, 354, 4885, 4, 7, 5, 3378]",2042.0,24151090,9
Factors associated with local-regional failure after definitive chemoradiation for locally advanced esophageal cancer.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2013-11-07,"Locally advanced esophageal cancer is often treated with a trimodality approach. While a substantial proportion of such patients initially achieve a clinical complete response (cCR) after chemoradiation, only a small proportion achieve durable control. We analyzed patients who reached cCR after definitive chemoradiation for esophageal cancer to identify clinical predictors of local disease recurrence. We identified 141 patients who obtained initial cCR after definitive chemoradiation without surgery for esophageal cancer from 2002 through 2009. The initial response to treatment was assessed by endoscopic evaluation and biopsy results, with cCR defined as having no evidence of disease present. Patterns of failure were categorized as in-field (within the planned treatment volume [PTV]), outside the radiation treatment field, or both. At a median follow-up of 22 months (range, 6-87 months), 77 patients (55 %) had experienced disease recurrence (local or both). Of first failures, 32 (23 %) were outside the radiation field, followed by 30 (21 %) within the field, and 15 (11 %) were both. By multivariate analysis, in-field failure after cCR was associated with a pretreatment standardized uptake value on positron emission tomography of >10 (subhazard ratio [SHR] 3.31, p = 0.023) and poorly differentiated tumors (SHR 3.69, p = 0.031). All failures, in-field and out-of-field, correlated with non-Caucasian ethnicity (SHR 2.55, p = 0.001), N1 disease (SHR 2.05, p = 0.034), T3/T4 disease (SHR 3.56, p = 0.011), and older age (SHR 0.96, p = 0.008).

Chemoradiation for esophageal cancer.,Thoracic surgery clinics,Thorac Surg Clin,2013-11-01,"Esophageal cancer management is based on baseline clinical stage, location of the tumor, and associated comorbid conditions. In patients with localized esophageal cancer (LEC) with technically resectable tumors and who are medically fit for surgery, the current recommendation is trimodality therapy (chemoradiation followed by surgery).

Prognostic value and targeted inhibition of survivin expression in esophageal adenocarcinoma and cancer-adjacent squamous epithelium.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2013-11-04,"Survivin is an inhibitor of apoptosis and its over expression is associated with poor prognosis in several malignancies. While several studies have analyzed survivin expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, few have focused on esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and/or cancer-adjacent squamous epithelium (CASE). The purpose of this study was 1) to determine the degree of survivin up regulation in samples of EAC and CASE, 2) to evaluate if survivin expression in EAC and CASE correlates with recurrence and/or death, and 3) to examine the effect of survivin inhibition on apoptosis in EAC cells. Fresh frozen samples of EAC and CASE from the same patient were used for qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis, and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was used for immunohistochemistry. EAC cell lines, OE19 and OE33, were transfected with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to knockdown survivin expression. This was confirmed by qRT-PCR for survivin expression and Western blot analysis of cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase 3 and survivin. Survivin expression data was correlated with clinical outcome. Survivin expression was significantly higher in EAC tumor samples compared to the CASE from the same patient. Patients with high expression of survivin in EAC tumor had an increased risk of death. Survivin expression was also noted in CASE and correlated with increased risk of distant recurrence. Cell line evaluation demonstrated that inhibition of survivin resulted in an increase in apoptosis. Higher expression of survivin in tumor tissue was associated with increased risk of death; while survivin expression in CASE was a superior predictor of recurrence.

Real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used to determine the expression of miRNA-106a gene in esophageal cancer tissue and corresponding normal mucosa of 81 cases. Immunohistochemical technique was applied to detect the expression of p53, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), DNA topoisomerase II (Topo II) and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP). The association of miRNA-106a expression with clinicopathological features, expression of related proteins, and prognosis of the patients was analyzed.

Increased prevalence of eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders in pediatric PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes.,Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr.,2014-05-01,"The PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes (PHTSs) are a collection of disorders caused by germline mutations of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN. Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs) are rare diseases characterized by food-induced, eosinophil-dominant inflammation in various segments of the gastrointestinal tract. On the basis of our clinical observations of several patients with EGID-PHTS, we investigated whether there is an association between these 2 disorders. The Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) warehouse was queried for the years 2007 to 2012 using International Classification of Diseases-9 codes for PTEN-related diseases; the results were cross-referenced with participants enrolled in the Cincinnati Center for Eosinophilic Disorder's EGID database to identify patients with both disorders. In an effort to replicate our findings, the Cleveland Clinic Genomic Medicine Institute PTEN database was queried for cases between 2005 and 2012. Inclusion criteria were age ≤ 18 years, history of PHTS, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and/or colonoscopy with at least 1 histologic EGID diagnosis confirmed by a CCHMC pathologist. The Pearson χ(2) test was used to determine the odds of EGID enrichment in PHTS. Of the 1,058,260 CCHMC distinct patients identified by the i2b2 search, 53 had clinical diagnoses suggestive of PHTS. Thirteen of the 53 had PTEN mutations, with 8 of 13 (62%) having had an EGD and/or colonoscopy. Five of the 8 had confirmed EGID. At the Cleveland Clinic, 3 of 75 patients (3/4 who had EGD and/or colonoscopy) with PHTS had confirmed EGID. CCHMC i2b2 query data showed a substantial enrichment of EGIDs in PHTSs (odds ratio  272; confidence interval 89-831, P < 0.0001). An EGID prevalence estimate from the i2b2 query supported a marked enrichment of EGIDs in PHTSs in the Cleveland Clinic database (P < 0.0001). Among the 8 subjects with EGIDs and PHTSs, the age at EGID and PHTS diagnosis was 7.6 ± 3.2 and 7.9 ± 5.8 years, respectively. Patients with EGID-PHTS had excess eosinophils in biopsies of the esophagus (75%), stomach (38%), and colon (13%), with a notable presence of eosinophil-rich gastrointestinal polyposis (88%).

"Prevalence of human papillomavirus infection in esophageal and cervical cancers in the high incidence area for the two diseases from 2007 to 2009 in Linzhou of Henan Province, Northern China.",Archives of virology,Arch. Virol.,2014-01-03,"The etiological role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical cancer has been well established. However, it is inconclusive whether HPV plays the same role in esophageal carcinogenesis. In this study, we detected HPV infection in 145 frozen esophageal tissues, including 30 normal epithelium (ENOR), 37 dysplasia (DYS) and 78 invasive squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and in 143 frozen cervical tissues composed of 30 normal epithelium (CNOR), 38 intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and 75 invasive squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). The patients and symptom-free subjects enrolled in this study were from a high-incidence area for both ESCC and CSCC, Linzhou City, Northern China, from 2007 to 2009. The HPV infection analysis was conducted by using an HPV GenoArray Test Kit. We found that the high-risk HPV types accounted for more than 90 % of the HPV-positive lesions of esophagus and cervix tissues. The prevalence of high-risk HPV types increased significantly during the progression of both esophageal and cervical carcinogenesis (positive rate in esophageal tissues: 33 % ENOR, 70 % in DYS and 69 % in ESCC; positive rate in cervical tissues: 27 % in CNOR, 82 % in CIN and 88 % in CSCC; P < 0.001, respectively). Infection with the high-risk HPV types increased the risk for both DYS and ESCC by 4-fold (DYS vs. ENOR: OR = 4.73, 95 %CI = 1.68-13.32; ESCC vs. ENOR: OR = 4.50, 95 %CI = 1.83-11.05) and increased the risk for both CIN and CSCC by 12-fold and 20-fold (CIN vs. CNOR: OR = 12.18, 95 %CI = 3.85-38.55; CSCC vs. CNOR: OR = 20.17, 95 %CI = 6.93-58.65), respectively. The prevalence of high-risk types in ESCC patients was lower than that in CSCC patients (P = 0.005) and was significantly associated with the degree of ESCC tumor infiltration (P = 0.001).

Esophageal cancer recurrence patterns and implications for surveillance.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2013-12-01,"After definitive treatment of esophageal cancer, patients are at high risk for recurrence. Consistent follow-up is important for detection and treatment of recurrence. The optimal surveillance regimen remains undefined. We investigated posttreatment recurrence patterns and methods of detection in survivors of esophageal cancer. We retrospectively studied a cohort of patients who had undergone surgical resection for esophageal cancer at our institution between 1996 and 2010. Routine computed tomography scan and upper endoscopy were performed for surveillance. In total, 1147 patients with resected esophageal adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma were included (median follow-up, 46 months). Of these, 723 patients (63%) had received neoadjuvant therapy before surgery. During follow-up, there were 595 deaths (52%) and 435 recurrences (38%) (distant [55%], locoregional [28%], or both [17%]). Half of recurrences were detected as a result of symptoms (n = 217), 45% by routine chest and abdominal computed tomography scan (n = 194), and 1% by surveillance upper endoscopy (n = 6). The recurrence rate decreased from 27 per 100 person-years in posttreatment year 1 to 4 per 100 person-years in year 6. In the first 2 years, the rate of recurrence was higher among patients who had received neoadjuvant therapy (35 per 100 person-years) than among those who had not (14 per 100 person-years) (p < 0.001). The incidence of recurrence is high after esophagectomy for cancer. Surveillance endoscopy has limited value for detection of asymptomatic local recurrence.

The Benefit of Chemotherapy in Esophageal Cancer Patients With Residual Disease After Trimodality Therapy.,American journal of clinical oncology,Am. J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-04-01,"The objective of this retrospective study was to determine the potential benefits of chemotherapy in esophageal cancer patients treated with chemoradiation followed by surgery. At our institution, 145 patients completed trimodality therapy from 1993 to 2009. Neoadjuvant treatment predominantly consisted of 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin with a concurrent median radiation dose of 50.4 Gy. Sixty-two patients received chemotherapy postoperatively. The majority (49/62) received 3 cycles of docetaxel. Within the entire cohort, a 5-year overall survival (OS) benefit was found in those who received postoperative chemotherapy, OS 37.1% versus 18.0% (P=0.024). The response after neoadjuvant chemoradiation was as follows: 33.8% had a pathologic complete response and 62.8% with residual disease. A 5-year OS and cause-specific survival (CSS) advantage were associated with postoperative chemotherapy among those with macroscopic residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy: OS 38.7% versus 13.9% (P=0.016), CSS 42.8% versus 18.8% (P=0.048). This benefit was not seen in those with a pathologic complete response or those with microscopic residual. A stepwise multivariate Cox regression model evaluating the partial response group revealed that postoperative chemotherapy and M stage were independent predictors of overall and CSS. This analysis revealed that patients with gross residual disease after trimodality therapy for esophageal cancer who received postoperative chemotherapy had an improved overall and CSS. These data suggest that patients with residual disease after trimodality therapy and a reasonable performance status may benefit from postoperative chemotherapy.

Human miR-1228 as a stable endogenous control for the quantification of circulating microRNAs in cancer patients.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2014-03-10,"Circulating microRNAs are promising biomarkers for non-invasive testing and dynamic monitoring in cancer patients. However, no consensus exists regarding the normalization of circulating microRNAs in the quantification, making the results incomparable. We investigated global circulating microRNA profiles to identify a stable endogenous control for quantifying circulating microRNAs using three cohorts (n = 544), including 168 control individuals (healthy subjects and those with chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis) and 376 cancer patients (hepatocellular, colorectal, lung, esophageal, gastric, renal, prostate, and breast cancer patients). GeNorm, NormFinder, and coefficient of variability (CV) were used to select the most stable endogenous control, whereas Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was adopted to explore its signaling pathways. Seven candidates (miR-1225-3p, miR-1228, miR-30d, miR-939, miR-940, miR-188-5p, and miR-134) from microarray analysis and four commonly used controls (miR-16, miR-223, let-7a, and RNU6B) from literature were subjected to real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction validation using independent cohorts. MiR-1228 (CV = 5.4%) with minimum M value and S value presented as the most stable endogenous control across eight cancer types and three controls. IPA showed miR-1228 to be involved extensively in metabolism-related signal pathways and organ morphology, implying that miR-1228 functions as a housekeeping gene.

On the interplay effects with proton scanning beams in stage III lung cancer.,Medical physics,Med Phys,2014-02-01,"To assess the dosimetric impact of interplay between spot-scanning proton beam and respiratory motion in intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for stage III lung cancer. Eleven patients were sampled from 112 patients with stage III nonsmall cell lung cancer to well represent the distribution of 112 patients in terms of target size and motion. Clinical target volumes (CTVs) and planning target volumes (PTVs) were defined according to the authors' clinical protocol. Uniform and realistic breathing patterns were considered along with regular- and hypofractionation scenarios. The dose contributed by a spot was fully calculated on the computed tomography (CT) images corresponding to the respiratory phase that the spot is delivered, and then accumulated to the reference phase of the 4DCT to generate the dynamic dose that provides an estimation of what might be delivered under the influence of interplay effect. The dynamic dose distributions at different numbers of fractions were compared with the corresponding 4D composite dose which is the equally weighted average of the doses, respectively, computed on respiratory phases of a 4DCT image set. Under regular fractionation, the average and maximum differences in CTV coverage between the 4D composite and dynamic doses after delivery of all 35 fractions were no more than 0.2% and 0.9%, respectively. The maximum differences between the two dose distributions for the maximum dose to the spinal cord, heart V40, esophagus V55, and lung V20 were 1.2 Gy, 0.1%, 0.8%, and 0.4%, respectively. Although relatively large differences in single fraction, correlated with small CTVs relative to motions, were observed, the authors' biological response calculations suggested that this interfractional dose variation may have limited biological impact. Assuming a hypofractionation scenario, the differences between the 4D composite and dynamic doses were well confined even for single fraction. Despite the presence of interplay effect, the delivered dose may be reliably estimated using the 4D composite dose. In general the interplay effect may not be a primary concern with IMPT for lung cancers for the authors' institution. The described interplay analysis tool may be used to provide additional confidence in treatment delivery.",Journal Article,2180.0,54.0,To assess the dosimetric impact of interplay between spot-scanning proton beam and respiratory motion in intensity-modulated proton therapy IMPT for stage III cancer Eleven patients were sampled from 112 patients with stage III nonsmall cell cancer to well represent the distribution of 112 patients in terms of target size and motion Clinical target volumes CTVs and planning target volumes PTVs were defined according to the authors clinical protocol Uniform and realistic breathing patterns were considered along with regular- and hypofractionation scenarios The dose contributed by a spot was fully calculated on the computed tomography CT images corresponding to the respiratory phase that the spot is delivered and then accumulated to the reference phase of the 4DCT to generate the dynamic dose that provides an estimation of what might be delivered under the influence of interplay effect The dynamic dose distributions at different numbers of fractions were compared with the corresponding 4D composite dose which is the equally weighted average of the doses respectively computed on respiratory phases of a 4DCT image set Under regular fractionation the average and maximum differences in CTV coverage between the 4D composite and dynamic doses after delivery of all 35 fractions were no more than 0.2 and 0.9 respectively The maximum differences between the two dose distributions for the maximum dose to the spinal cord V40 V55 and V20 were 1.2 Gy 0.1 0.8 and 0.4 respectively Although relatively large differences in single fraction correlated with small CTVs relative to motions were observed the authors biological response calculations suggested that this interfractional dose variation may have limited biological impact Assuming a hypofractionation scenario the differences between the 4D composite and dynamic doses were well confined even for single fraction Despite the presence of interplay effect the delivered dose may be reliably estimated using the 4D composite dose In general the interplay effect may not be a primary concern with IMPT for cancers for the authors institution The described interplay analysis tool may be used to provide additional confidence in treatment delivery,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,"[6, 423, 3, 3187, 345, 1, 5709, 59, 6901, 3702, 2095, 1345, 2, 2718, 2967, 4, 837, 1757, 2095, 36, 5534, 9, 82, 316, 12, 2627, 7, 11, 5919, 29, 3726, 7, 5, 82, 316, 5667, 31, 12, 6, 149, 1231, 3, 1395, 1, 3726, 7, 4, 1794, 1, 283, 444, 2, 2967, 38, 283, 2225, 14256, 2, 1349, 283, 2225, 13631, 11, 395, 768, 6, 3, 738, 38, 1182, 3490, 2, 7661, 8540, 764, 11, 515, 1510, 5, 3316, 2, 7614, 3964, 3, 61, 3447, 20, 8, 6901, 10, 1910, 981, 23, 3, 1220, 872, 425, 1572, 1734, 6, 3, 2718, 124, 17, 3, 6901, 16, 1623, 2, 818, 6664, 6, 3, 2482, 124, 1, 3, 12650, 6, 2562, 3, 2540, 61, 17, 777, 35, 4470, 1, 2067, 822, 40, 1623, 669, 3, 1054, 1, 5709, 254, 3, 2540, 61, 4477, 28, 338, 1870, 1, 1550, 11, 72, 5, 3, 1734, 5321, 3308, 61, 92, 16, 3, 4142, 2337, 1011, 1, 3, 415, 106, 1220, 23, 2718, 3523, 1, 8, 12650, 1482, 916, 669, 3316, 3519, 3, 1011, 2, 689, 362, 4, 3402, 2139, 59, 3, 5321, 3308, 2, 2540, 415, 50, 989, 1, 62, 465, 1550, 11, 77, 80, 76, 13, 18, 2, 13, 83, 106, 3, 689, 362, 59, 3, 100, 61, 4477, 9, 3, 689, 61, 6, 3, 1499, 1885, 12454, 29521, 2, 8120, 11, 14, 18, 381, 13, 14, 13, 66, 2, 13, 39, 106, 242, 1352, 375, 362, 4, 226, 1509, 438, 5, 302, 14256, 580, 6, 18395, 11, 164, 3, 738, 1037, 51, 8229, 1148, 17, 26, 15640, 61, 1380, 68, 47, 383, 1037, 345, 7242, 8, 7614, 5456, 3, 362, 59, 3, 5321, 3308, 2, 2540, 415, 11, 149, 2902, 871, 9, 226, 1509, 550, 3, 463, 1, 5709, 254, 3, 1623, 61, 68, 40, 4092, 661, 75, 3, 5321, 3308, 61, 4, 1083, 3, 5709, 254, 68, 44, 40, 8, 86, 2893, 5, 5534, 9, 163, 9, 3, 738, 731, 3, 1027, 5709, 65, 1515, 68, 40, 95, 6, 377, 402, 307, 4, 24, 989]",2208.0,24506612,466

"Stereotactic ablative radiation therapy for centrally located early stage or isolated parenchymal recurrences of non-small cell lung cancer: how to fly in a ""no fly zone"".","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2014-04-01,"We extended our previous experience with stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR; 50 Gy in 4 fractions) for centrally located non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); explored the use of 70 Gy in 10 fractions for cases in which dose-volume constraints could not be met with the previous regimen; and suggested modified dose-volume constraints. Four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT)-based volumetric image-guided SABR was used for 100 patients with biopsy-proven, central T1-T2N0M0 (n=81) or isolated parenchymal recurrence of NSCLC (n=19). All disease was staged with positron emission tomography/CT; all tumors were within 2 cm of the bronchial tree, trachea, major vessels, esophagus, heart, pericardium, brachial plexus, or vertebral body. Endpoints were toxicity, overall survival (OS), local and regional control, and distant metastasis. At a median follow-up time of 30.6 months, median OS time was 55.6 months, and the 3-year OS rate was 70.5%. Three-year cumulative actuarial local, regional, and distant control rates were 96.5%, 87.9%, and 77.2%, respectively. The most common toxicities were chest-wall pain (18% grade 1, 13% grade 2) and radiation pneumonitis (11% grade 2 and 1% grade 3). No patient experienced grade 4 or 5 toxicity.

Influence of preoperative radiation field on postoperative leak rates in esophageal cancer patients after trimodality therapy.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2014-04-01,"Postoperative morbidities, such as anastomotic leaks, are common after trimodality therapy (chemoradiation followed by surgery) for esophageal cancer. We investigated for factors associated with an increased incidence of anastomotic leaks. Data from 285 esophageal cancer patients treated from 2000 to 2011 with trimodality therapy were analyzed. Anastomotic location relative to preoperative radiation field was assessed using postoperative computed tomographic imaging. Logistic regression was used to evaluate for factors associated with any or clinically relevant (CR) (≥ grade 2) leaks. Overall anastomotic leak rate was 11% (31 of 285), and CR leak rate was 6% (17 of 285). Multivariable analysis identified body mass index (odds ratio [OR], 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.17; OR, 1.11, 95% CI, 1.01-1.22), three-field surgery (OR, 10.01; 95% CI, 3.83-26.21; OR, 4.83; 95% CI, 1.39-16.71), and within radiation field (""in-field"") anastomosis (OR, 5.37; 95% CI, 2.21-13.04; OR, 8.63; 95% CI, 2.90-25.65) as independent predictors of both all grade and CR leaks, respectively. While patients with distal esophageal tumors and Ivor-Lewis surgery had the lowest incidence of all grade (6.5%) and CR leaks (4.2%), most of the leaks were associated with the anastomosis constructed within the field of radiation (in-field: 39% and 30% versus out-of-field: 2.6% and 1.0%, respectively, for total and CR leaks, p less than 0.0001, Fisher's exact test). Esophagogastric anastomosis placed within the preoperative radiation field was a very strong predictor for anastomotic leaks in esophageal cancer patients treated with trimodality therapy, among other factors.

Downregulation of 14-3-3σ correlates with multistage carcinogenesis and poor prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2014-04-17,"The asymptomatic nature of early-stage esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) results in late presentation and consequent dismal prognosis This study characterized 14-3-3σ protein expression in the multi-stage development of ESCC and determined its correlation with clinical features and prognosis. Western blot was used to examine 14-3-3σ protein expression in normal esophageal epithelium (NEE), low grade intraepithelial neoplasia (LGIN), high grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN), ESCC of TNM I to IV stage and various esophageal epithelial cell lines with different biological behavior. Immunohistochemistry was used to estimate 14-3-3σ protein in 110 biopsy samples of NEE, LGIN or HGIN and in 168 ESCC samples all of whom had follow-up data. Support vector machine (SVM) was used to develop a classifier for prognosis. 14-3-3σ decreased progressively from NEE to LGIN, to HGIN, and to ESCC. Chemoresistant sub-lines of EC9706/PTX and EC9706/CDDP showed high expression of 14-3-3σ protein compared with non-chemoresistant ESCC cell lines and immortalized NEC. Furthermore, the downregulation of 14-3-3σ correlated significantly with histological grade (P = 0.000) and worse prognosis (P = 0.004). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that 14-3-3σ protein (P = 0.016) and T stage (P = 0.000) were independent prognostic factors for ESCC.

Experience with thoracoscopic pneumonectomies at a single institution.,"Innovations (Philadelphia, Pa.)",Innovations (Phila),,"The aim of this study was to review a single-institution experience with video-assisted thoracoscopic pneumonectomy (VATP). From July 2008 through December 2012, the medical records of all patients undergoing pneumonectomy (total and completion) for lung cancer were reviewed. Clinical parameters were recorded and analyzed. During this period, 16% (7/45) of pneumonectomies for malignancy were performed thoracoscopically. Patient selection was performed in the context of a multidisciplinary tumor board. Of the seven VATPs, five were standard (Video 1, available at http://links.lww.com/INNOV/A40) and two were completion pneumonectomies (Video 2, available at http://links.lww.com/INNOV/A41). Indications were primary lung cancer in six (three adenocarcinoma, one squamous carcinoma, one large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, and one mixed adenocarcinoma cell and small cell lung carcinoma) and metastatic esophageal cancer in one patient. Preoperative selection was based on unfavorable location of the primary tumor, which excluded the possibility of a lesser resection such as sleeve resection while permitting an R0 resection by pneumonectomy. Pathologic staging was consistent with clinical staging except for one patient who was upstaged. There were four complications: atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, and two bronchopleural fistulas. The median length of stay was 4 days (excluding one outlier). Distant disease recurrence occurred in one patient. Kaplan-Meier survival at 24 months was 75%. Introduction of VATP into the armamentarium of the experienced thoracoscopic surgeon is feasible with acceptable outcomes and a complication profile that is not dissimilar to the open pneumonectomy experience.

Helical tomotherapy with dynamic running-start-stop delivery compared to conventional tomotherapy delivery.,Medical physics,Med Phys,2014-05-01,"Despite superior target dose uniformity, helical tomotherapy(®) (HT) may involve a trade-off between longitudinal dose conformity and beam-on time (BOT), due to the limitation of only three available jaw sizes with the conventional HT (1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 cm). The recently introduced dynamic running-start-stop (RSS) delivery allows smaller jaw opening at the superior and inferior ends of the target when a sharp penumbra is needed. This study compared the dosimetric performance of RSS delivery with the fixed jaw HT delivery. Twenty patient cases were selected and deidentified prior to treatment planning, including 16 common clinical cases (brain, head and neck (HN), lung, and prostate) and four special cases of whole brain with hippocampus avoidance (WBHA) that require a high degree of dose modulation. HT plans were generated for common clinical cases using the fixed 2.5 cm jaw width (HT2.5) and WBHA cases using 1.0 cm (HT1.0). The jaw widths for RSS were preset with a larger size (RSS5.0 vs HT2.5 and RSS2.5 vs HT1.0). Both delivery techniques were planned based on identical contours, prescriptions, and planning objectives. Dose indices for targets and critical organs were compared using dose-volume histograms, BOT, and monitor units. The average BOT was reduced from 4.8 min with HT2.5 to 2.5 min with RSS5.0. Target dose homogeneity with RSS5.0 was shown comparable to HT2.5 for common clinical sites. Superior normal tissue sparing was observed in RSS5.0 for optic nerves and optic chiasm in brain and HN cases. RSS5.0 demonstrated improved dose sparing for cord and esophagus in lung cases, as well as penile bulb in prostate cases. The mean body dose was comparable for both techniques. For the WBHA cases, the target homogeneity was significantly degraded in RSS2.5 without distinct dose sparing for hippocampus, compared to HT1.0. Compared to the fixed jaw HT delivery, RSS combined with a larger jaw width provides faster treatment delivery and improved cranial-caudal target dose conformity. The target coverage achieved by RSS with a large jaw width is comparable to the fixed jaw HT delivery for common cancer sites, but may deteriorate for cases where complex geometry is present in the middle part of the target.",Comparative Study,2091.0,10.0,Despite superior target dose uniformity helical tomotherapy ® HT may involve a trade-off between longitudinal dose conformity and beam-on time BOT due to the limitation of only three available jaw sizes with the conventional HT 1.0 2.5 and 5.0 cm The recently introduced dynamic running-start-stop RSS delivery allows smaller jaw opening at the superior and inferior ends of the target when a sharp penumbra is needed This study compared the dosimetric performance of RSS delivery with the fixed jaw HT delivery Twenty patient cases were selected and deidentified prior to treatment planning including 16 common clinical cases brain head and HN and and four special cases of whole brain with hippocampus avoidance WBHA that require a high degree of dose modulation HT plans were generated for common clinical cases using the fixed 2.5 cm jaw width HT2.5 and WBHA cases using 1.0 cm HT1.0 The jaw widths for RSS were preset with a larger size RSS5.0 vs HT2.5 and RSS2.5 vs HT1.0 Both delivery techniques were planned based on identical contours prescriptions and planning objectives Dose indices for targets and critical organs were compared using dose-volume histograms BOT and monitor units The average BOT was reduced from 4.8 min with HT2.5 to 2.5 min with RSS5.0 Target dose homogeneity with RSS5.0 was shown comparable to HT2.5 for common clinical sites Superior normal tissue sparing was observed in RSS5.0 for optic nerves and optic chiasm in brain and HN cases RSS5.0 demonstrated improved dose sparing for cord and in cases as well as bulb in cases The mean body dose was comparable for both techniques For the WBHA cases the target homogeneity was significantly degraded in RSS2.5 without distinct dose sparing for hippocampus compared to HT1.0 Compared to the fixed jaw HT delivery RSS combined with a larger jaw width provides faster treatment delivery and improved cranial-caudal target dose conformity The target coverage achieved by RSS with a large jaw width is comparable to the fixed jaw HT delivery for common cancer sites but may deteriorate for cases where complex geometry is present in the middle part of the target,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[550, 1123, 283, 61, 9338, 6638, 7731, 6081, 3152, 68, 3882, 8, 10550, 1889, 59, 2380, 61, 8693, 2, 1345, 23, 98, 21611, 520, 6, 3, 5039, 1, 158, 169, 390, 7670, 4131, 5, 3, 809, 3152, 14, 13, 18, 33, 2, 33, 13, 494, 3, 761, 3955, 2540, 18585, 2435, 7142, 15697, 989, 2333, 2170, 7670, 11677, 28, 3, 1123, 2, 1663, 10894, 1, 3, 283, 198, 8, 9978, 20675, 16, 575, 26, 45, 72, 3, 3187, 528, 1, 15697, 989, 5, 3, 1959, 7670, 3152, 989, 737, 69, 140, 11, 715, 2, 19849, 324, 6, 24, 1349, 141, 245, 186, 38, 140, 342, 718, 2, 9132, 2, 2, 294, 3714, 140, 1, 902, 342, 5, 17944, 5863, 40709, 17, 1353, 8, 64, 1444, 1, 61, 2356, 3152, 1853, 11, 1419, 9, 186, 38, 140, 75, 3, 1959, 18, 33, 494, 7670, 5195, 35803, 33, 2, 40709, 140, 75, 14, 13, 494, 40710, 13, 3, 7670, 23880, 9, 15697, 11, 35804, 5, 8, 1077, 444, 32273, 13, 105, 35803, 33, 2, 48327, 33, 105, 40710, 13, 110, 989, 1092, 11, 1465, 90, 23, 3038, 6137, 7654, 2, 1349, 2409, 61, 3824, 9, 637, 2, 740, 2285, 11, 72, 75, 61, 433, 8638, 21611, 2, 3334, 2960, 3, 1011, 21611, 10, 405, 29, 39, 66, 1538, 5, 35803, 33, 6, 18, 33, 1538, 5, 32273, 13, 283, 61, 7502, 5, 32273, 13, 10, 443, 1279, 6, 35803, 33, 9, 186, 38, 633, 1123, 295, 246, 1851, 10, 164, 4, 32273, 13, 9, 5670, 6721, 2, 5670, 14583, 4, 342, 2, 9132, 140, 32273, 13, 264, 231, 61, 1851, 9, 1885, 2, 4, 140, 22, 149, 22, 18572, 4, 140, 3, 313, 642, 61, 10, 1279, 9, 110, 1092, 9, 3, 40709, 140, 3, 283, 7502, 10, 97, 10034, 4, 48327, 33, 187, 834, 61, 1851, 9, 17944, 72, 6, 40710, 13, 72, 6, 3, 1959, 7670, 3152, 989, 15697, 397, 5, 8, 1077, 7670, 5195, 777, 5308, 24, 989, 2, 231, 2565, 17595, 283, 61, 8693, 3, 283, 2139, 513, 20, 15697, 5, 8, 375, 7670, 5195, 16, 1279, 6, 3, 1959, 7670, 3152, 989, 9, 186, 12, 633, 84, 68, 26086, 9, 140, 1257, 840, 12337, 16, 364, 4, 3, 3897, 760, 1, 3, 283]",2138.0,24784375,424
Fluorescent nanoparticle imaging allows noninvasive evaluation of immune cell modulation in esophageal dysplasia.,Molecular imaging,Mol Imaging,2014-01-01,"Esophageal tumors provide unique challenges and opportunities for developing and testing surveillance imaging technology for different tumor microenvironment components, including assessment of immune cell modulation, with the ultimate goal of promoting early detection and response evaluation. In this context, accessibility through the lumen using a minimally invasive approach provides a means for repetitive evaluation longitudinally by combining fluorescent endoscopic imaging technology with novel fluorescent nanoparticles that are phagocytized by immune cells in the microenvironment. The agent we developed for imaging is synthesized from Feraheme (ferumoxytol), a Food and Drug Administration-approved monocrystaline dextran-coated iron oxide nanoparticle, which we conjugated to a near-infrared fluorochrome, CyAL5.5. We demonstrate a high level of uptake of the fluorescent nanoparticles by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the esophagus and spleen of L2Cre;p120ctnflox/flox mice. These mice develop esophageal dysplasia leading to squamous cell carcinoma; we have previously demonstrated that dysplastic and neoplastic esophageal lesions in these mice have an immune cell infiltration that is dominated by MDSCs.

Single-institution retrospective comparison of preoperative versus definitive chemoradiotherapy for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2014-05-23,"We sought to determine the impact of esophagectomy on survival in patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus cancer after chemoradiotherapy (CRT). A database of esophageal cancer was queried for nonmetastatic patients with adenocarcinoma treated between 2000 and 2011 with CRT. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) curves were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank analysis. Multivariate analysis was performed by the Cox proportional hazard model. We identified 154 patients (60 without surgery; 94 with surgery) who were included in the analysis. The only differences between the 2 groups were more advanced disease stage, improved performance status, and younger age in the surgery group. Patients undergoing surgery had significantly higher survival. Median and 5-year OS for surgical patients were 4.1 years and 43.6 %, versus 1.9 years and 35.6 % for nonsurgical patients (p = 0.007). Multivariate analysis for OS and RFS revealed that factors associated with increased survival were surgical resection, tumor length < 5 cm, male gender, and lower stage. Age, tumor location, radiation dose/technique, and induction chemotherapy were not prognostic. There was a trend toward improved survival on univariate analysis (p = 0.10) and multivariate analysis (p = 0.063) for surgical patients compared to nonsurgical patients who were healthy enough for surgery before CRT (n = 38), and no difference in OS in nonsurgical patients healthy enough for surgery after CRT (n = 22).

New directions in perioperative management of locally advanced esophagogastric cancer.,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book. American Society of Clinical Oncology. Annual Meeting,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,2014-01-01,"Cancers of the esophagus arise as adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas; these represent distinct diseases, with differing prognosis, yet they are often studied in common trials. With surgery alone, 5 year survival for T2-T3N0 disease is less than 30% to 40%, and declines to less than 25% with nodal involvement. The CROSS randomly assigned patients to surgery alone or to weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel X 5 and 41.4 Gy concurrent radiotherapy, followed by surgery. Seventy-five percent of enrolled patients had adenocarcinoma. Preoperative combined-modality therapy improved R0 resection from 69% to 92% (p &lt; 0.001 and improved median survival from 24 months to 49.4 months (p &lt; 0.003). This regimen reduced both locoregional recurrence (34% to 14%; p &lt; 0.001) and the development of peritoneal carcinomatosis (14% to 4%; p &lt; 0.001). Systemic perioperative therapy may have a greater effect on distant disease, the predominant mode of failure for these patients, and current trials compare preoperative chemoradiation with periooperative systemic therapy. PET scan response during preoperative chemotherapy without radiotherapy correlates with improvements in pathologic response and with improved survival. Nonresponse on early PET scan allows identifıcation of patients for earlier surgery and discontinuation of ineffective preoperative chemotherapy, without survival detriment. There is no predictive benefıt for early PET scan during the course of chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy. The use of early PET scan during induction chemotherapy is being evaluated in CALGB/Alliance trial (NCT01333033). Molecular profıling has identifıed somatic gene mutations and pathways that may be oncogenic in upper gastrointestinal cancers. Potential targets include the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), HER2, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), fıbroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), MEK, and others.

Metformin sensitizes chemotherapy by targeting cancer stem cells and the mTOR pathway in esophageal cancer.,International journal of oncology,Int. J. Oncol.,2014-05-21,"Our clinical study indicates esophageal adenocarcinoma patients on metformin had a better treatment response than those without metformin. However, the effects of metformin and the mechanisms of its action in esophageal cancer (EC) are unclear. EC cell lines were used to assess the effects of metformin alone or in combination with 5-fluorouracil on survival and apoptosis. RPPA proteomic array and immunoblots were used to identify signaling affected by metformin. Standard descriptive statistical methods were used. Reduction in cell survival and induction of apoptosis by metformin were observed in several EC cell lines. The use of metformin in combination with 5-FU significantly sensitized EC cells to the cytotoxic effect of 5-FU. RPPA array demonstrated that metformin decreased various oncogenes including PI3K/mTORsignaling and survival/cancer stem cell-related genes in cells treated with metformin compared with its control. Immunoblots and transcriptional analyses further confirm that metformin downregulated these CSC-related genes and the components of the mTOR pathway in a dose‑dependent manner. Sorted ALDH-1+ cell tumor sphere forming capacity was preferentially reduced by metformin. Finally, metformin reduced tumor growth in vivo and when combined with FU, there was synergistic reduction in tumor growth. Metformin inhibits EC cell growth and sensitizes EC cells to 5-FU cytotoxic effects by targeting CSCs and the components of mTOR.

Causes of death in long-term survivors of head and neck cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2014-02-22,"Survivors of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) face excess mortality from multiple causes. We used the population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry data to evaluate the causes of death in patients with nonmetastatic HNSCC diagnosed between 1992 and 2005 who survived at least 3 years from diagnosis (long-term survivors). We used competing-risks proportional hazards regression to estimate probabilities of death from causes: HNSCC, second primary malignancy (SPM) excluding HNSCC, cardiovascular disease, and other causes. We identified 35,958 three-year survivors of HNSCC with a median age at diagnosis of 60 years (range = 18-100 years) and a median follow-up of 7.7 years (range = 3-18 years). There were 13,120 deaths during the study period. Death from any cause at 5 and 10 years was 15.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 15.0%-15.8%) and 41.0% (95% CI = 40.4%-41.6%), respectively. There were 3852 HNSCC deaths including both primary and subsequent head and neck tumors. The risk of death from HNSCC was greater in patients with nasopharynx or hypopharynx cancer and in patients with locally advanced disease. SPM was the leading cause of non-HNSCC death, and the most common sites of SPM death were lung (53%), esophagus (10%), and colorectal (5%) cancer.

We retrospectively identified patients with advanced esophageal carcinoma treated with curative intent at our institution between 1998 and 2004. Identified patients were separated into 3 groups: patients who received TMT, patients who received CRT, and patients who began treatment with trimodality intent but did not undergo surgery (PTMT). Local control, overall survival (OS), and distant metastasis-free survival were compared using Kaplan-Meier statistics.

Hippo coactivator YAP1 upregulates SOX9 and endows esophageal cancer cells with stem-like properties.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2014-06-06,"Cancer stem cells (CSC) are purported to initiate and maintain tumor growth. Deregulation of normal stem cell signaling may lead to the generation of CSCs; however, the molecular determinants of this process remain poorly understood. Here we show that the transcriptional coactivator YAP1 is a major determinant of CSC properties in nontransformed cells and in esophageal cancer cells by direct upregulation of SOX9. YAP1 regulates the transcription of SOX9 through a conserved TEAD binding site in the SOX9 promoter. Expression of exogenous YAP1 in vitro or inhibition of its upstream negative regulators in vivo results in elevated SOX9 expression accompanied by the acquisition of CSC properties.

Homozygous GNAS 393C-allele carriers with locally advanced esophageal cancer fail to benefit from platinum-based preoperative chemoradiotherapy.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg.

GNAS T393C has been shown to predict the postoperative course in solid tumors and may therefore be useful for treatment stratification. The aim of the present study was to determine if the single-nucleotide polymorphism GNAS T393C can be used for treatment stratification in esophageal cancer patients. A total of 596 patients underwent surgical resection for esophageal carcinoma from 1996 to 2008; 279 patients received chemoradiotherapy prior to surgery (RTX-SURG group). All patients and a reference group of 820 healthy White individuals were genotyped for GNAS T393C. The 5-year-survival rate for the 317 patients who underwent esophagectomy as initial treatment (SURG group) was 57 % for homozygous C-allele carriers (n = 99) and 43 % for T-allele carriers (n = 218; log- rank test p = 0.025). Multivariate analysis revealed the GNAS T393C genotype (p = 0.034), pT (p < 0.001), pN (p < 0.001) and age (p < 0.001) as prognostic of survival. Homozygous C-allele carriers with a locally advanced tumor stage (cT3/T4, n = 129) in the SURG group had a 5-year survival rate of 37 %, which, remarkably, exceeded the 5-year survival rate of 30 % for the entire RTX-SURG group (n = 279). In the RTX-SURG group, the GNAS T393C genotype did not show any prognostic significance.

This was a retrospective review of 52 patients with a planning target volume within 2 cm of the esophagus from a prospective registry of 607 lung and liver SBRT patients treated between 2005 and 2011. Patients were treated using a risk-adapted dose regimen to a median dose of 50 Gy in 5 fractions (range, 37.5-60 Gy in 3-10 fractions). Normal structures were contoured using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) defined criteria. The median esophageal point dose and 1-cc dose were 32.3 Gy (range, 8.9-55.4 Gy) and 24.0 Gy (range, 7.8-50.9 Gy), respectively.

"Treatment trends, risk of lymph node metastasis, and outcomes for localized esophageal cancer.",Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2014-07-16,"Endoscopic resection is increasingly used to treat localized, early-stage esophageal cancer. We sought to assess its adoption, characterize the risks of nodal metastases, and define differences in procedural mortality and 5-year survival between endoscopic and surgical resection in the United States. From the National Cancer Data Base, patients with T1a and T1b lesions were identified. Treatment patterns were characterized, and hierarchical regression methods were used to define predictors and evaluate outcomes. All statistical tests were two-sided. Five thousand three hundred ninety patients were identified and underwent endoscopic (26.5%) or surgical resection (73.5%). Endoscopic resection increased from 19.0% to 53.0% for T1a lesions (P < .001) and from 6.6% to 20.9% for T1b cancers (P < .001). The strongest predictors of endoscopic resection were depth of invasion (T1a vs T1b: odds ratio [OR] = 4.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.76 to 5.27) and patient age of 75 years or older (vs age less than 55 years: OR = 4.86; 95% CI = 3.60 to 6.57). Among patients undergoing surgery, lymph node metastasis was 5.0% for T1a and 16.6% for T1b lesions. Predictors of nodal metastases included tumor size greater than 2 cm (vs. <2 cm) and intermediate-/high-grade lesions (vs low grade). For example, 0.5% of patients with low-grade T1a lesions less than 2 cm had lymph node involvement. The risk of 30-day mortality was less after endoscopic resection (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.33; 95% CI = 0.19 to 0.58) but greater for conditional 5-year survival (HR = 1.63; 95% CI = 1.07 to 2.47).

Signet ring cells in esophageal adenocarcinoma predict poor response to preoperative chemoradiation.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2014-07-16,"The purpose of this study was to examine the significance of signet ring cell histology to predict response to preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma. Two groups of patients with locoregional esophageal adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgery were studied: those with signet ring cell adenocarcinoma (n = 85) and a reference group (n = 638) with usual and other types of adenocarcinoma. Surgical specimens were reviewed for degree of pathologic response and pathologic stage. Cox regression models were used to assess the effects of clinicopathologic variables on survival. Tumors from patients in the signet ring cell group had a lower rate of complete pathologic response (9% versus 26%, p < 0.001) and more frequent positive margins (24% versus 10%, p < 0.001) compared with tumors from the reference group. Median overall survival (22 versus 48 months, p = 0.003) and disease-free survival (16 versus 35 months, p = 0.007) were shorter in the signet ring cell group than in the reference group. Signet ring cell histology and high pathologic stage were significant predictors of decreased overall survival and disease-free survival. Survival durations for patients whose resected specimens showed downstaging after neoadjuvant chemoradiation did not significantly differ from survival durations of patients whose specimens did not show downstaging in the signet ring cell group, unlike the reference group.

To determine whether genetic alterations in the Barrett's mucosa can predict response to endoscopic therapy. Retrospective cohort study. Tertiary-care institution. Selected patients who underwent endoscopic therapy for BE containing HGD/IMC between 2003 and 2010. Endoscopic therapy combining mucosal resection and different ablation modalities was performed based on patient characteristics, endoscopic findings, and technique evolution. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to evaluate genetic alterations on baseline endoscopic cytology brushings by using probes directed to loci 8q24 (MYC), 9p21 (CDKN2A; alias P16), 17q12 (ERBB2; alias Her-2/neu), and 20q13.2 (ZNF217). Genetic biomarkers predicting achievement of CRD after endoscopic therapy. A total of 181 patients were included (145 men; 66 ± 10 years of age). There were 130 patients (72%) who responded to endoscopic therapy with CRD. Multiple gains detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization was found to be a negative predictor (hazard ratio 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.82) after adjusting for potential clinical confounders.

Post-chemoradiation surgical pathology stage can customize the surveillance strategy in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma.,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,2014-08-01,"Current algorithms for surveillance of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) after chemoradiation and surgery (trimodality therapy [TMT]) remain empiric. The authors hypothesized that the frequency, type, and timing of relapses after TMT would be highly associated with surgical pathology stage (SPS), and therefore SPS could be used to individualize the surveillance strategy. Between 2000 and 2010, 518 patients with EAC were identified who underwent TMT at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and were frequently surveyed. Frequency, type, and timing of the first relapse (locoregional and/or distant) were tabulated according to SPS. Standard statistical approaches were used. The median follow-up time after esophageal surgery was 55.4 months (range, 1.0-149.2 months). Disease relapse occurred in 215 patients (41.5%). Higher SPS was associated with a higher rate of relapse (0/I vs II/III, P≤.001; 0/I vs II, P=.002; SPS 0/I vs III, P≤.001; and SPS II vs III, P=.005) and with shorter time to relapse (P<.001). Irrespective of the SPS, approximately 95% of all relapses occurred within 36 months of surgery. The 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were shorter for patients with a higher SPS than those with a lower SPS (0/I vs II/III, P≤.001; 0/I vs II, P≤.001; 0/I vs III, P≤.001; and II vs III, P=.014). The compelling data show an excellent association between SPS and frequency/type/timing of relapses after TMT in patients with EAC. Thus, the surveillance strategy can potentially be customized based on SPS. These data can inform a future evidence-based surveillance strategy that can be efficient and cost-effective.

"Evaluation of a 4-protein serum biomarker panel-biglycan, annexin-A6, myeloperoxidase, and protein S100-A9 (B-AMP)-for the detection of esophageal adenocarcinoma.",Cancer,Cancer,2014-08-05,"Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is associated with a dismal prognosis. The identification of cancer biomarkers can advance the possibility for early detection and better monitoring of tumor progression and/or response to therapy. The authors present results from the development of a serum-based, 4-protein (biglycan, myeloperoxidase, annexin-A6, and protein S100-A9) biomarker panel for EAC. A vertically integrated, proteomics-based biomarker discovery approach was used to identify candidate serum biomarkers for the detection of EAC. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples that were collected from across the Barrett esophagus (BE)-EAC disease spectrum. The mass spectrometry-based spectral count data were used to guide the selection of candidate serum biomarkers. Then, the serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay data were validated in an independent cohort and were used to develop a multiparametric risk-assessment model to predict the presence of disease. With a minimum threshold of 10 spectral counts, 351 proteins were identified as differentially abundant along the spectrum of Barrett esophagus, high-grade dysplasia, and EAC (P<.05). Eleven proteins from this data set were then tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in serum samples, of which 5 proteins were significantly elevated in abundance among patients who had EAC compared with normal controls, which mirrored trends across the disease spectrum present in the tissue data. By using serum data, a Bayesian rule-learning predictive model with 4 biomarkers was developed to accurately classify disease class; the cross-validation results for the merged data set yielded accuracy of 87% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 93%.

Re-evaluating the optimal radiation dose for definitive chemoradiotherapy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2014-09-01,"The optimal radiation dose for treating esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has long been debated. We evaluated if doses greater than 50.4 Gy delivered with modern techniques are beneficial in terms of tumor control, survival, and toxicity. We included 193 consecutive patients with ESCC treated with definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy from 1998 to 2012. Patients were treated to a dose of ≤50.4 Gy (low-dose, n = 137) or greater than 50.4 Gy (high-dose, n = 56). Tumor response, local-regional control, survival, and treatment toxicity were compared between groups. High-dose group had a significantly lower local failure rate (17.9% versus 34.3%, p = 0.024) and a marginal better 5-year local-regional failure-free survival (68.7% versus 55.9%, p = 0.052) than the low-dose group.

Phase II Study of Modified FOLFOX6 With Bevacizumab in Metastatic Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma.,American journal of clinical oncology,Am. J. Clin. Oncol.,2017-04-01,"The median survival for patients with metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma is <12 months. Bevacizumab has demonstrated promising activity in metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma when used in combination with cisplatin-based regimens for patients from the Americas. We conducted a prospective phase II trial to investigate the efficacy of bevacizumab in combination with the oxaliplatin-based regimen, modified FOLFOX6, in patients with metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. Patients with untreated metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach, gastroesophageal junction, or distal esophagus received mFOLFOX6 (leucovorin 400 mg/m, fluorouracil 400 mg/m bolus and 2400 mg/m continuous infusion over 46 h, oxaliplatin 85 mg/m) and bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) every 2 weeks until disease progression or intolerance. Response by RECIST was evaluated by CT scan every 8 weeks. The primary objective was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary objectives were safety, response rate, and overall survival (OS). A total of 39 patients with untreated metastastic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma were enrolled between September 2008 and June 2012. Median number of cycles administered was 12 (range, 4 to 86). The confirmed response rate was 56.4% (3 complete response and 19 partial response). The median PFS was 7.8 months and median OS was 14.7 months. Three patients remain on treatment, and 11 patients are alive, of whom 6 have survived >24 months. Treatment-related grade 3/4 toxicities included neutropenia (33.3%), neuropathy (20.5%), thromboembolism (VTE) (7.7%), thrombocytopenia (7.7%), anemia (2.6%), hypertension (2.6%), and proteinuria (2.6%). We observed no GI perforations or grade 3/4 GI hemorrhagic events. First-line mFOLFOX6 with bevacizumab for metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma was well tolerated and associated with longer PFS and OS compared with historical data from similar populations treated without bevacizumab. Our results suggest that the addition of bevacizumab to mFOLFOX6 may provide clinical benefit in American patients with metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, a finding consistent with previous studies of first-line bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy for this disease.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",1025.0,5.0,The median survival for patients with metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma is 12 months Bevacizumab has demonstrated promising activity in metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma when used in combination with cisplatin-based regimens for patients from the Americas We conducted a prospective phase II trial to investigate the efficacy of bevacizumab in combination with the oxaliplatin-based regimen modified FOLFOX6 in patients with metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma Patients with untreated metastatic adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction or distal received mFOLFOX6 leucovorin 400 mg/m fluorouracil 400 mg/m bolus and 2400 mg/m continuous infusion over 46 h oxaliplatin 85 mg/m and bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progression or intolerance Response by RECIST was evaluated by CT scan every 8 weeks The primary objective was progression-free survival PFS secondary objectives were safety response rate and overall survival OS A total of 39 patients with untreated metastastic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma were enrolled between September 2008 and June 2012 Median number of cycles administered was 12 range 4 to 86 The confirmed response rate was 56.4 3 complete response and 19 partial response The median PFS was 7.8 months and median OS was 14.7 months Three patients remain on treatment and 11 patients are alive of whom 6 have survived 24 months Treatment-related grade 3/4 toxicities included neutropenia 33.3 neuropathy 20.5 thromboembolism VTE 7.7 thrombocytopenia 7.7 anemia 2.6 hypertension 2.6 and proteinuria 2.6 We observed no GI perforations or grade 3/4 GI hemorrhagic events First-line mFOLFOX6 with bevacizumab for metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma was well tolerated and associated with longer PFS and OS compared with historical data from similar populations treated without bevacizumab Our results suggest that the addition of bevacizumab to mFOLFOX6 may provide clinical benefit in American patients with metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma a finding consistent with previous studies of first-line bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy for this disease,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[3, 52, 25, 9, 7, 5, 113, 3227, 449, 16, 133, 53, 599, 71, 264, 721, 128, 4, 113, 3227, 449, 198, 95, 4, 150, 5, 540, 90, 472, 9, 7, 29, 3, 31128, 21, 426, 8, 482, 124, 215, 160, 6, 963, 3, 209, 1, 599, 4, 150, 5, 3, 1476, 90, 477, 1230, 15754, 4, 7, 5, 113, 3227, 449, 7, 5, 1278, 113, 449, 1, 3, 3227, 3322, 15, 2107, 103, 9404, 3296, 1524, 81, 188, 1404, 1524, 81, 188, 3604, 2, 12518, 81, 188, 1314, 904, 252, 641, 555, 1476, 772, 81, 188, 2, 599, 79, 81, 503, 454, 18, 244, 1100, 34, 91, 15, 5266, 51, 20, 1834, 10, 194, 20, 425, 1657, 454, 66, 244, 3, 86, 461, 10, 91, 115, 25, 300, 568, 2409, 11, 367, 51, 116, 2, 63, 25, 118, 8, 181, 1, 587, 7, 5, 1278, 22107, 3227, 449, 11, 346, 59, 2636, 1375, 2, 1924, 1195, 52, 207, 1, 410, 468, 10, 133, 184, 39, 6, 868, 3, 557, 51, 116, 10, 664, 39, 27, 236, 51, 2, 326, 450, 51, 3, 52, 300, 10, 67, 66, 53, 2, 52, 118, 10, 213, 67, 53, 169, 7, 918, 23, 24, 2, 175, 7, 32, 1701, 1, 953, 49, 47, 2996, 259, 53, 24, 139, 88, 27, 39, 385, 159, 778, 466, 27, 1751, 179, 33, 3501, 1779, 67, 67, 1340, 67, 67, 1545, 18, 49, 1824, 18, 49, 2, 5381, 18, 49, 21, 164, 77, 2104, 13041, 15, 88, 27, 39, 2104, 6998, 281, 157, 328, 9404, 5, 599, 9, 113, 3227, 449, 10, 149, 421, 2, 41, 5, 589, 300, 2, 118, 72, 5, 2252, 74, 29, 288, 1184, 73, 187, 599, 114, 99, 309, 17, 3, 352, 1, 599, 6, 9404, 68, 377, 38, 247, 4, 597, 7, 5, 113, 3227, 449, 8, 1567, 925, 5, 698, 94, 1, 157, 328, 599, 4, 150, 5, 56, 9, 26, 34]",2146.0,25144267,143
Clinical staging of patients with early esophageal adenocarcinoma: does FDG-PET/CT have a role?,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2014-08-01,"Esophageal carcinoma is a significant worldwide health problem and the incidence is increasing faster than that of any other malignancy. 18F-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is important in the management of patients with potentially resectable esophageal cancer and is useful in initial staging of locally advanced cancer and after neoadjuvant therapy. The purpose of this study is to determine the utility of FDG-PET/CT in the clinical staging of early-stage esophageal cancer. Subjects in this retrospective study were 79 consecutive patients with cTisN0 (high-grade dysplasia) and cT1N0 primary esophageal adenocarcinoma diagnosed by endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound biopsy that were evaluated with preoperative FDG-PET/CT and had not received neoadjuvant therapy. Seventh edition American Joint Committee on Cancer cTNM and FDG-PET/CT were compared with postoperative pTNM staging. pT1 was subdivided into intramucosal cancers with lamina propria or muscularis mucosa invasion (pT1a) and submucosal cancers (pT1b). In pT staging, the frequency of FDG uptake increased with increasing pT, from pT1a 21 of 39 (53.8%) to pT1b 19 of 22 (55.8%). pTis was three of five (60.0%). Similarly, the maximum standardized uptake value of FDG-avid lesions increased with increasing pT, with median values of 3.7 for pTis, 3.8 for pT1a and 4.2 for T1b. In cN staging, FDG-PET/CT was negative in 76 patients and positive in three patients. All three patients with FDG-avid nodes on FDG-PET/CT were negative for metastatic disease on biopsy. In 12 patients with pN1 and in one patient with N2, FDG-PET/CT was falsely negative. Sensitivity and positive predictive value for pN disease were 0% and accuracy was 82%. There were no distant metastases. In cM staging, FDG-PET/CT was falsely positive in five patients (FDG avid nodules n = 3, distant nodal metastasis n = 2) and resulted in unwarranted biopsy in four patients. FDG-PET/CT is not useful in the TNM staging of primary adenocarcinoma of the esophagus when endoscopy and biopsy indicate cTis and cT1. In fact, FDGPET/CT can be detrimental to patient management. Because regional nodal metastases are uncommon and distant metastases rare, and as FDG-PET/CT can result in inappropriate clinical care, FDG-PET/CT should not be performed in the evaluation of early-stage esophageal cancer.",Journal Article,1999.0,22.0,carcinoma is a significant worldwide health problem and the incidence is increasing faster than that of any other malignancy 18F-2-deoxy-D-glucose FDG -positron emission tomography/computed tomography PET/CT is important in the management of patients with potentially resectable cancer and is useful in initial staging of locally advanced cancer and after neoadjuvant therapy The purpose of this study is to determine the utility of FDG-PET/CT in the clinical staging of early-stage cancer Subjects in this retrospective study were 79 consecutive patients with cTisN0 high-grade dysplasia and cT1N0 primary adenocarcinoma diagnosed by endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound biopsy that were evaluated with preoperative FDG-PET/CT and had not received neoadjuvant therapy Seventh edition American Joint Committee on Cancer cTNM and FDG-PET/CT were compared with postoperative pTNM staging pT1 was subdivided into intramucosal cancers with lamina propria or muscularis mucosa invasion pT1a and submucosal cancers pT1b In pT staging the frequency of FDG uptake increased with increasing pT from pT1a 21 of 39 53.8 to pT1b 19 of 22 55.8 pTis was three of five 60.0 Similarly the maximum standardized uptake value of FDG-avid lesions increased with increasing pT with median values of 3.7 for pTis 3.8 for pT1a and 4.2 for T1b In cN staging FDG-PET/CT was negative in 76 patients and positive in three patients All three patients with FDG-avid nodes on FDG-PET/CT were negative for metastatic disease on biopsy In 12 patients with pN1 and in one patient with N2 FDG-PET/CT was falsely negative Sensitivity and positive predictive value for pN disease were 0 and accuracy was 82 There were no distant metastases In cM staging FDG-PET/CT was falsely positive in five patients FDG avid nodules n 3 distant nodal metastasis n 2 and resulted in unwarranted biopsy in four patients FDG-PET/CT is not useful in the TNM staging of primary adenocarcinoma of the when endoscopy and biopsy indicate cTis and cT1 In fact FDGPET/CT can be detrimental to patient management Because regional nodal metastases are uncommon and distant metastases rare and as FDG-PET/CT can result in inappropriate clinical care FDG-PET/CT should not be performed in the evaluation of early-stage cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[134, 16, 8, 93, 2358, 341, 2497, 2, 3, 287, 16, 602, 5308, 76, 17, 1, 500, 127, 710, 4751, 18, 6149, 427, 2522, 1285, 1900, 1799, 872, 1220, 872, 495, 425, 16, 305, 4, 3, 284, 1, 7, 5, 751, 1899, 12, 2, 16, 999, 4, 388, 632, 1, 795, 131, 12, 2, 50, 536, 36, 3, 743, 1, 26, 45, 16, 6, 223, 3, 1207, 1, 1285, 495, 425, 4, 3, 38, 632, 1, 191, 82, 12, 976, 4, 26, 459, 45, 11, 842, 935, 7, 5, 64804, 64, 88, 2253, 2, 40180, 86, 449, 265, 20, 4199, 2, 2056, 1945, 411, 17, 11, 194, 5, 498, 1285, 495, 425, 2, 42, 44, 103, 536, 36, 8114, 3580, 597, 2093, 2002, 23, 12, 37895, 2, 1285, 495, 425, 11, 72, 5, 573, 21059, 632, 7063, 10, 10676, 237, 16790, 163, 5, 12503, 10859, 15, 13936, 2713, 578, 17785, 2, 9729, 163, 18958, 4, 3395, 632, 3, 675, 1, 1285, 1135, 101, 5, 602, 3395, 29, 17785, 239, 1, 587, 699, 66, 6, 18958, 326, 1, 350, 614, 66, 13833, 10, 169, 1, 365, 335, 13, 1813, 3, 689, 1670, 1135, 549, 1, 1285, 5189, 406, 101, 5, 602, 3395, 5, 52, 1030, 1, 27, 67, 9, 13833, 27, 66, 9, 17785, 2, 39, 18, 9, 6142, 4, 3183, 632, 1285, 495, 425, 10, 199, 4, 846, 7, 2, 109, 4, 169, 7, 62, 169, 7, 5, 1285, 5189, 502, 23, 1285, 495, 425, 11, 199, 9, 113, 34, 23, 411, 4, 133, 7, 5, 7945, 2, 4, 104, 69, 5, 3473, 1285, 495, 425, 10, 16683, 199, 485, 2, 109, 464, 549, 9, 2700, 34, 11, 13, 2, 1190, 10, 878, 125, 11, 77, 626, 196, 4, 494, 632, 1285, 495, 425, 10, 16683, 109, 4, 365, 7, 1285, 5189, 2597, 78, 27, 626, 779, 278, 78, 18, 2, 627, 4, 15644, 411, 4, 294, 7, 1285, 495, 425, 16, 44, 999, 4, 3, 2918, 632, 1, 86, 449, 1, 3, 198, 4199, 2, 411, 1008, 34939, 2, 7669, 4, 1991, 64805, 425, 122, 40, 6227, 6, 69, 284, 408, 951, 779, 196, 32, 2052, 2, 626, 196, 622, 2, 22, 1285, 495, 425, 122, 757, 4, 5148, 38, 165, 1285, 495, 425, 257, 44, 40, 173, 4, 3, 451, 1, 191, 82, 12]",2261.0,25157774,499
"A phase II trial of induction epirubicin, oxaliplatin, and fluorouracil, followed by surgery and postoperative concurrent cisplatin and fluorouracil chemoradiotherapy in patients with locoregionally advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction.",Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2014-10-01,"Preoperative chemoradiotherapy improves local control in patients with locoregionally advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ). Distant failure remains common, however, suggesting potential benefit from additional chemotherapy. This phase II study investigated the addition of induction chemotherapy to surgery and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Patients with cT3-4 or N1 or M1a (American Joint Committee on Cancer 6th edition) adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and GEJ were eligible. Induction chemotherapy, with epirubicin 50 mg/m/d, oxaliplatin 130 mg/m/d, and fluorouracil 200 mg/m/d continuous infusion for 3 weeks, was given every 21 days for three courses, followed by surgery. Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy consisted of 50 to 55 Gy at 1.8 to 2.0 Gy/d and two courses of cisplatin (20 mg/m/d) and fluorouracil (1000 mg/m/d) during weeks 1 and 4 of radiotherapy. Between February 2008 and January 2012, 60 evaluable patients enrolled. Resection was accomplished in 54 patients (90%) and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy in 48 (80%) patients. Toxicity included unplanned hospitalization in 18% of patients during induction chemotherapy and 19% of patients during adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. There was one chemotherapy-related and two postoperative deaths. With a median follow-up of 43 months, the projected 3-year locoregional control is 88%, distant metastatic control 46%, relapse-free survival 41%, and overall survival 47%. Symptomatic response to chemotherapy and the percentage of remaining viable tumor at surgery proved the strongest predictors of survival and distant control. Chemotherapy, surgery, and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy are feasible and produce outcomes similar to other multimodality treatment schedules in locoregionally advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and GEJ.

Thirty-day mortality underestimates the risk of early death after major resections for thoracic malignancies.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2014-09-08,"Operative mortality rates are of great interest to surgeons, patients, policy makers, and payers as a metric for quality assessment. Thirty-day mortality and discharge mortality have been presumed to capture procedure-related deaths. However, many patients die after the 30-day mark or are transferred to other facilities or to home and die there, leading to the underreporting of surgically related deaths. We hypothesized that a longer period of observation would address these concerns and provide a more accurate measure of operative mortality. We retrospectively reviewed institutional databases of patients undergoing resection for lung cancer, esophageal cancer, and mesothelioma. Mortality rates at 30 and 90 days were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). From 1999 to 2012, 7,646 surgical resections were performed: 6,119 for lung cancer, 1,258 for esophageal cancer, and 269 for mesothelioma. Among the different cancers and across operations, the additional mortality from day 31 to 90 (1.4%; 95% CI, 1.2% to 1.8%; n=111) was similar to that by day 30 (1.2%; 95% CI, 1.0% to 1.5%; n=95), resulting in overall 90-day mortality (2.7%; 95% CI, 2.3% to 3.1%; n=206) that was more than double the 30-day mortality. Among patients who have undergone operations for thoracic malignancies, mortality attributable to the operation occurs beyond the first 30 postsurgical days as well as after hospital discharge. Because cancer operations constitute a large portion of general thoracic surgery, we recommend national databases consider the inclusion of 90-day mortality in their data collection.",Comparative Study,1961.0,35.0,"Operative mortality rates are of great interest to surgeons patients policy makers and payers as a metric for quality assessment Thirty-day mortality and discharge mortality have been presumed to capture procedure-related deaths However many patients die after the 30-day mark or are transferred to other facilities or to home and die there leading to the underreporting of surgically related deaths We hypothesized that a longer period of observation would address these concerns and provide a more accurate measure of operative mortality We retrospectively reviewed institutional databases of patients undergoing resection for cancer cancer and Mortality rates at 30 and 90 days were calculated with 95 confidence intervals CIs From 1999 to 2012 7,646 surgical resections were performed 6,119 for cancer 1,258 for cancer and 269 for Among the different cancers and across operations the additional mortality from day 31 to 90 1.4 95 CI 1.2 to 1.8 n=111 was similar to that by day 30 1.2 95 CI 1.0 to 1.5 n=95 resulting in overall 90-day mortality 2.7 95 CI 2.3 to 3.1 n=206 that was more than double the 30-day mortality Among patients who have undergone operations for thoracic malignancies mortality attributable to the operation occurs beyond the first 30 postsurgical days as well as after hospital discharge Because cancer operations constitute a large portion of general thoracic surgery we recommend national databases consider the inclusion of 90-day mortality in their data collection",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[1208, 282, 151, 32, 1, 2797, 1333, 6, 1613, 7, 4196, 10888, 2, 9361, 22, 8, 6515, 9, 372, 455, 977, 218, 282, 2, 2993, 282, 47, 85, 5472, 6, 2891, 1299, 139, 1043, 137, 445, 7, 3384, 50, 3, 201, 218, 8863, 15, 32, 4747, 6, 127, 4351, 15, 6, 3249, 2, 3384, 125, 1049, 6, 3, 25408, 1, 2350, 139, 1043, 21, 1237, 17, 8, 589, 727, 1, 1664, 688, 1539, 46, 2061, 2, 377, 8, 80, 1481, 1463, 1, 1208, 282, 21, 894, 446, 1115, 2348, 1, 7, 479, 170, 9, 12, 12, 2, 282, 151, 28, 201, 2, 424, 162, 11, 981, 5, 48, 307, 1582, 1927, 29, 2043, 6, 1195, 67, 14458, 221, 2185, 11, 173, 49, 4299, 9, 12, 14, 8289, 9, 12, 2, 8639, 9, 107, 3, 338, 163, 2, 716, 3867, 3, 402, 282, 29, 218, 456, 6, 424, 14, 39, 48, 58, 14, 18, 6, 14, 66, 78, 3167, 10, 288, 6, 17, 20, 218, 201, 14, 18, 48, 58, 14, 13, 6, 14, 33, 78, 48, 1113, 4, 63, 424, 218, 282, 18, 67, 48, 58, 18, 27, 6, 27, 14, 78, 5956, 17, 10, 80, 76, 1627, 3, 201, 218, 282, 107, 7, 54, 47, 1989, 3867, 9, 2098, 441, 282, 2971, 6, 3, 2589, 1780, 1654, 3, 157, 201, 6891, 162, 22, 149, 22, 50, 702, 2993, 408, 12, 3867, 4999, 8, 375, 3206, 1, 1083, 2098, 152, 21, 2237, 657, 2348, 2419, 3, 1680, 1, 424, 218, 282, 4, 136, 74, 2442]",1495.0,25200731,139
Prognostic role of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor-1 in patients with esophageal cancer.,Anticancer research,Anticancer Res.,2014-09-01,"To present long-term results regarding the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) for esophageal cancer. In 68 esophageal cancer patients, VEGF, VEGFR-1 plus ten other factors were analyzed for locoregional control (LRC), metastases-free survival (MFS) and survival up to 10 years. On multivariate analysis, improved LRC was associated with hemoglobin during radiotherapy ≥12 g/dl (p=0.001). VEGF-negativity showed a trend for better LRC on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, better MFS was associated with hemoglobin ≥12 g/dl (p=0.012), better performance status (p=0.009) and lower tumor stage (p=0.032).

Definitive reirradiation for locoregionally recurrent non-small cell lung cancer with proton beam therapy or intensity modulated radiation therapy: predictors of high-grade toxicity and survival outcomes.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2014-09-11,"Intrathoracic recurrence of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after initial treatment remains a dominant cause of death. We report our experience using proton beam therapy and intensity modulated radiation therapy for reirradiation in such cases, focusing on patterns of failure, criteria for patient selection, and predictors of toxicity. A total of 102 patients underwent reirradiation for intrathoracic recurrent NSCLC at a single institution. All doses were recalculated to an equivalent dose in 2-Gy fractions (EQD2). All patients had received radiation therapy for NSCLC (median initial dose of 70 EQD2 Gy), with median interval to reirradiation of 17 months and median reirradiation dose of 60.48 EQD2 Gy. Median follow-up time was 6.5 months (range, 0-72 months). Ninety-nine patients (97%) completed reirradiation. Median local failure-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and overall survival times were 11.43 months (range, 8.6-22.66 months), 11.43 months (range, 6.83-23.84 months), and 14.71 (range, 10.34-20.56 months), respectively. Toxicity was acceptable, with rates of grade ≥3 esophageal toxicity of 7% and grade ≥3 pulmonary toxicity of 10%. Of the patients who developed local failure after reirradiation, 88% had failure in either the original or the reirradiation field. Poor local control was associated with T4 disease, squamous histology, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score >1. Concurrent chemotherapy improved DMFS, but T4 disease was associated with poor DMFS. Higher T status, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≥1, squamous histology, and larger reirradiation target volumes led to worse overall survival; receipt of concurrent chemotherapy and higher EQD2 were associated with improved OS. Intensity modulated radiation therapy and proton beam therapy are options for treating recurrent non-small cell lung cancer. However, rates of locoregional recurrence and distant metastasis are high, and patients should be selected carefully to maximize the benefit of additional aggressive local therapy while minimizing the risk of adverse side effects.",Journal Article,1958.0,36.0,Intrathoracic recurrence of cell cancer NSCLC after initial treatment remains a dominant cause of death We report our experience using proton beam therapy and intensity modulated radiation therapy for reirradiation in such cases focusing on patterns of failure criteria for patient selection and predictors of toxicity A total of 102 patients underwent reirradiation for intrathoracic recurrent NSCLC at a single institution All doses were recalculated to an equivalent dose in 2-Gy fractions EQD2 All patients had received radiation therapy for NSCLC median initial dose of 70 EQD2 Gy with median interval to reirradiation of 17 months and median reirradiation dose of 60.48 EQD2 Gy Median follow-up time was 6.5 months range 0-72 months Ninety-nine patients 97 completed reirradiation Median local failure-free survival distant metastasis-free survival DMFS and overall survival times were 11.43 months range 8.6-22.66 months 11.43 months range 6.83-23.84 months and 14.71 range 10.34-20.56 months respectively Toxicity was acceptable with rates of grade ≥3 toxicity of 7 and grade ≥3 pulmonary toxicity of 10 Of the patients who developed local failure after reirradiation 88 had failure in either the original or the reirradiation field Poor local control was associated with T4 disease squamous histology and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score 1 Concurrent chemotherapy improved DMFS but T4 disease was associated with poor DMFS Higher T status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≥1 squamous histology and larger reirradiation target volumes led to worse overall survival receipt of concurrent chemotherapy and higher EQD2 were associated with improved OS Intensity modulated radiation therapy and proton beam therapy are options for treating recurrent cell cancer However rates of locoregional recurrence and distant metastasis are high and patients should be selected carefully to maximize the benefit of additional aggressive local therapy while minimizing the risk of adverse side effects,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[7359, 146, 1, 31, 12, 304, 50, 388, 24, 469, 8, 2156, 708, 1, 273, 21, 414, 114, 730, 75, 2095, 1345, 36, 2, 837, 1757, 121, 36, 9, 4510, 4, 225, 140, 3312, 23, 764, 1, 496, 371, 9, 69, 881, 2, 674, 1, 155, 8, 181, 1, 2867, 7, 208, 4510, 9, 7359, 387, 304, 28, 8, 226, 731, 62, 415, 11, 19659, 6, 35, 2017, 61, 4, 18, 381, 1550, 10010, 62, 7, 42, 103, 121, 36, 9, 304, 52, 388, 61, 1, 431, 10010, 381, 5, 52, 268, 6, 4510, 1, 269, 53, 2, 52, 4510, 61, 1, 335, 576, 10010, 381, 52, 166, 126, 98, 10, 49, 33, 53, 184, 13, 720, 53, 2493, 762, 7, 1015, 781, 4510, 52, 293, 496, 115, 25, 626, 278, 115, 25, 5930, 2, 63, 25, 1072, 11, 175, 601, 53, 184, 66, 49, 350, 700, 53, 175, 601, 53, 184, 49, 852, 382, 874, 53, 2, 213, 792, 184, 79, 562, 179, 664, 53, 106, 155, 10, 1595, 5, 151, 1, 88, 2608, 155, 1, 67, 2, 88, 2608, 1087, 155, 1, 79, 1, 3, 7, 54, 276, 293, 496, 50, 4510, 889, 42, 496, 4, 361, 3, 2279, 15, 3, 4510, 1067, 334, 293, 182, 10, 41, 5, 2463, 34, 691, 784, 2, 2118, 1690, 413, 87, 528, 156, 368, 14, 750, 56, 231, 5930, 84, 2463, 34, 10, 41, 5, 334, 5930, 142, 102, 156, 2118, 1690, 413, 87, 528, 156, 3567, 691, 784, 2, 1077, 4510, 283, 2225, 836, 6, 639, 63, 25, 1699, 1, 750, 56, 2, 142, 10010, 11, 41, 5, 231, 118, 837, 1757, 121, 36, 2, 2095, 1345, 36, 32, 838, 9, 1367, 387, 31, 12, 137, 151, 1, 1325, 146, 2, 626, 278, 32, 64, 2, 7, 257, 40, 715, 3900, 6, 4116, 3, 247, 1, 402, 571, 293, 36, 369, 4501, 3, 43, 1, 290, 1152, 176]",2041.0,25220718,363
Importance of surveillance and success of salvage strategies after definitive chemoradiation in patients with esophageal cancer.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2014-09-15,"Patients with esophageal carcinoma (EC) who are treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (bimodality therapy [BMT]) experience frequent relapses. In a large cohort, we assessed the timing, frequency, and types of relapses during an aggressive surveillance program and the value of the salvage strategies. Patients with EC (N = 276) who received BMT were analyzed. Patients who had surgery within 6 months of chemoradiotherapy were excluded to reduce bias. We focused on local relapse (LR) and distant metastases (DM) and the salvage treatment of patients with LR only. Standard statistical methods were applied. The median follow-up time was 54.3 months (95% CI, 48.4 to 62.4). First relapses included LR only in 23.2% (n = 64), DM with or without LR in 43.5% (n = 120), and no relapses in 33.3% (n = 92) of patients. Final relapses included no relapses in 33.3%, LR only in 14.5%, DM only in 15.9%, and DM plus LR in 36.2% of patients. Ninety-one percent of LRs occurred within 2 years and 98% occurred within 3 years of BMT. Twenty-three (36%) of 64 patients with LR only underwent salvage surgery, and their median overall survival was 58.6 months (95% CI, 28.8 to not reached) compared with those patients with LR only who were unable to undergo surgery (9.5 months; 95% CI, 7.8 to 13.3). Unlike in patients undergoing trimodality therapy, for whom surveillance/salvage treatment plays a lesser role,(1) in the BMT population, approximately 8% of all patients (or 36% of patients with LR only) with LRs occurring more than 6 months after chemoradiotherapy can undergo salvage treatment, and their survival is excellent.

Overexpression of human β-defensin 2 promotes growth and invasion during esophageal carcinogenesis.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2014-11-01,"Human β-defensin 2 (HBD-2) is an antimicrobial peptide produced by mucosal surfaces in response to microbial exposure or inflammatory cytokines. Although HBD-2 is expressed in the esophagus in response to stress and infectious agents, little is known regarding its expression and functional role in esophageal carcinogenesis. In the current investigation, normal esophagus and N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA)-induced precancerous and papillomatous lesions of the rat esophagus were characterized for HBD-2 encoding gene Defb4 and protein. HBD-2 was found to be overexpressed in esophagi of rats treated with NMBA compared to animals in control group. Results of Real-time PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry demonstrated a positive correlation between the overexpression of HBD-2 and the progression of rat squamous cell carcinogenesis (SCC) in the esophagus. We also observed that HBD-2 is overexpressed in tumor tissues removed from patients with esophageal SCC. Moreover, Defb4 silencing in vitro suppresses the tumor cell proliferation, mobility and invasion in esophageal SCC cell line KYSE-150. The results from this study provide experimental evidence that HBD-2 may play an oncogenic role in the initiation and progression of esophageal SCC and thus serves as a target for chemopreventive and therapeutic interventions.

Genetic polymorphisms in the 9p21 region associated with risk of multiple cancers.,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,2014-09-19,"The chromosome 9p21 region has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple cancers. We analyzed 9p21 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from eight genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with data deposited in dbGaP, including studies of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), gastric cancer (GC), pancreatic cancer, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), lung cancer (LC), breast cancer (BrC), bladder cancer (BC) and prostate cancer (PrC). The number of subjects ranged from 2252 (PrC) to 7619 (LC). SNP-level analyses for each cancer were conducted by logistic regression or random-effects meta-analysis. A subset-based statistical approach (ASSET) was performed to combine SNP-level P values across multiple cancers. We calculated gene-level P values using the adaptive rank truncated product method. We identified that rs1063192 and rs2157719 in the CDKN2A/2B region were significantly associated with ESCC and rs2764736 (3' of TUSC1) was associated with BC (P ≤ 2.59 × 10(-6)). ASSET analyses identified four SNPs significantly associated with multiple cancers: rs3731239 (CDKN2A intronic) with ESCC, GC and BC (P = 3.96 × 10(-) (4)); rs10811474 (3' of IFNW1) with RCC and BrC (P = 0.001); rs12683422 (LINGO2 intronic) with RCC and BC (P = 5.93 × 10(-) (4)) and rs10511729 (3' of ELAVL2) with LC and BrC (P = 8.63 × 10(-) (4)). At gene level, CDKN2B, CDKN2A and CDKN2B-AS1 were significantly associated with ESCC (P ≤ 4.70 × 10(-) (5)).

FTEP involved transferring patients to the telemetry unit instead of the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) after esophagectomy.

Postoperative morbidity and mortality, LOS, and hospital charges were reviewed. Compared with group A, group B had significantly shorter median LOS (12 days vs 8 days; P < 0.001); lower mean numbers of SICU days (4.5 days vs 1.2 days; P < 0.001) and telemetry days (12.7 days vs 9.7 days; P < 0.001); and lower rates of atrial arrhythmia (27% vs 19%; P = 0.013) and pulmonary complications (27% vs 20%; P = 0.016). Multivariable analysis revealed FTEP to be associated with shorter LOS (P < 0.001) even after adjustment for predictors like tumor histology and location. FTEP was also associated with a lower rate of pulmonary complications (odds ratio = 0.655; 95% confidence interval = 0.456, 0.942; P = 0.022). In addition, the median hospital charges associated with primary admission and readmission within 90 days for group B ($65,649) were lower than that for group A ($79,117; P < 0.001).

Clinical implementation of intensity modulated proton therapy for thoracic malignancies.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2014-09-24,"Intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) can improve dose conformality and better spare normal tissue over passive scattering techniques, but range uncertainties complicate its use, particularly for moving targets. We report our early experience with IMPT for thoracic malignancies in terms of motion analysis and management, plan optimization and robustness, and quality assurance. Thirty-four consecutive patients with lung/mediastinal cancers received IMPT to a median 66 Gy(relative biological equivalence [RBE]). All patients were able to undergo definitive radiation therapy. IMPT was used when the treating physician judged that IMPT conferred a dosimetric advantage; all patients had minimal tumor motion (<5 mm) and underwent individualized tumor-motion dose-uncertainty analysis and 4-dimensional (4D) computed tomographic (CT)-based treatment simulation and motion analysis. Plan robustness was optimized by using a worst-case scenario method. All patients had 4D CT repeated simulation during treatment. IMPT produced lower mean lung dose (MLD), lung V5 and V20, heart V40, and esophageal V60 than did IMRT (P<.05) and lower MLD, lung V20, and esophageal V60 than did passive scattering proton therapy (PSPT) (P<.05). D5 to the gross tumor volume and clinical target volume was higher with IMPT than with intensity modulated radiation therapy or PSPT (P<.05). All cases were analyzed for beam-angle-specific motion, water-equivalent thickness, and robustness. Beam angles were chosen to minimize the effect of respiratory motion and avoid previously treated regions, and the maximum deviation from the nominal dose-volume histogram values was kept at <5% for the target dose and met the normal tissue constraints under a worst-case scenario. Patient-specific quality assurance measurements showed that a median 99% (range, 95% to 100%) of the pixels met the 3% dose/3 mm distance criteria for the γ index. Adaptive replanning was used for 9 patients (26.5%).

Screening high-risk cancer patients for VTE: a prospective observational study.,Thrombosis research,Thromb. Res.,2014-09-20,"The utility of screening for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients is unknown. We evaluated this in a prospective cohort study of cancer patients initiating a new chemotherapy regimen and deemed high-risk (score ≥3) based on a validated Risk Score. Patients were evaluated with baseline and Q4 (±1) week serial ultrasonography for up to 16 weeks; additionally, computed tomography scans for restaging were also evaluated for VTE. The study population comprised 35 patients. Pancreatic and gastro-esophageal cancers were the most common diagnoses. Of these, 8 (23%) developed a VTE. This included 5 patients with DVT alone (14%), 1 patient with PE alone (3%) and 2 (6%) with both. Ultrasound examinations identified asymptomatic DVT in 9.3% of patients at baseline; 0% at weeks 4 and 8 and 5.6% at week 12.

Local control and toxicity in a large cohort of central lung tumors treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2014-10-08,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in central lung tumors has been associated with higher rates of severe toxicity. We sought to evaluate toxicity and local control in a large cohort and to identify predictive dosimetric parameters. We identified patients who received SBRT for central tumors according to either of 2 definitions. Local failure (LF) was estimated using a competing risks model, and multivariate analysis (MVA) was used to assess factors associated with LF. We reviewed patient toxicity and applied Cox proportional hazard analysis and log-rank tests to assess whether dose-volume metrics of normal structures correlated with pulmonary toxicity. One hundred twenty-five patients received SBRT for non-small cell lung cancer (n=103) or metastatic lesions (n=22), using intensity modulated radiation therapy. The most common dose was 45 Gy in 5 fractions. Median follow-up was 17.4 months. Incidence of toxicity ≥ grade 3 was 8.0%, including 5.6% pulmonary toxicity. Sixteen patients (12.8%) experienced esophageal toxicity ≥ grade 2, including 50% of patients in whom PTV overlapped the esophagus. There were 2 treatment-related deaths. Among patients receiving biologically effective dose (BED) ≥80 Gy (n=108), 2-year LF was 21%. On MVA, gross tumor volume (GTV) was significantly associated with LF. None of the studied dose-volume metrics of the lungs, heart, proximal bronchial tree (PBT), or 2 cm expansion of the PBT (""no-fly-zone"" [NFZ]) correlated with pulmonary toxicity ≥grade 2. There were no differences in pulmonary toxicity between central tumors located inside the NFZ and those outside the NFZ but with planning target volume (PTV) intersecting the mediastinum. Using moderate doses, SBRT for central lung tumors achieves acceptable local control with low rates of severe toxicity. Dosimetric analysis showed no significant correlation between dose to the lungs, heart, or NFZ and severe pulmonary toxicity.

The IASLC/ITMIG Thymic Epithelial Tumors Staging Project: proposals for the T Component for the forthcoming (8th) edition of the TNM classification of malignant tumors.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2014-09-01,"Despite longstanding recognition of thymic epithelial neoplasms, there is no official American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control stage classification. This article summarizes proposals for classification of the T component of stage classification for use in the 8th edition of the tumor, node, metastasis classification for malignant tumors. This represents the output of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer and the International Thymic Malignancies Interest Group Staging and Prognostics Factor Committee, which assembled and analyzed a worldwide database of 10,808 patients with thymic malignancies from 105 sites. The committee proposes division of the T component into four categories, representing levels of invasion. T1 includes tumors localized to the thymus and anterior mediastinal fat, regardless of capsular invasion, up to and including infiltration through the mediastinal pleura. Invasion of the pericardium is designated as T2. T3 includes tumors with direct involvement of a group of mediastinal structures either singly or in combination: lung, brachiocephalic vein, superior vena cava, chest wall, and phrenic nerve. Invasion of more central structures constitutes T4: aorta and arch vessels, intrapericardial pulmonary artery, myocardium, trachea, and esophagus. Size did not emerge as a useful descriptor for stage classification. This classification of T categories, combined with a classification of N and M categories, provides a basis for a robust tumor, node, metastasis classification system for the 8th edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control stage classification.

Increased time from neoadjuvant chemoradiation to surgery is associated with higher pathologic complete response rates in esophageal cancer.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2014-11-18,"The interval between neoadjuvant chemoradiation treatment and surgery has been described as an important predictor of pathologic response to therapy in nonesophageal cancer sites. We retrospectively reviewed our experience with patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation and esophagectomy to better understand the impact of the timing of surgery on pathologic complete response rates in esophageal cancer. Two hundred thirty-one sequentially treated patients from 2000 to 2011 were identified for this study; 88 of these patients completed neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by esophagectomy at our institution. The interval between completion of chemoradiation and surgery was calculated for each patient. The patients were categorized into quartiles and also into 3-week interval groups. Treatment factors and surgical morbidity data, including the estimated blood loss and length of operative stay, were also assessed. Quartiles for the neoadjuvant chemoradiation to surgery interval were less than 45 days, 46 to 50 days, 51 to 63 days, and 64+ days.

Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy for centrally located early stage non-small-cell lung cancer: what we have learned.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2015-04-01,"Image-guided stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR; also called stereotactic body radiotherapy or radiosurgery) has become a standard treatment for medically inoperable peripherally located stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and can achieve local control rates in excess of 90%. However, the role of SABR for centrally located lesions remains controversial because of concerns about the potential for severe toxic effects. When cutting-edge technologies and knowledge-based optimization of SABR planning that considers both target coverage and normal tissue sparing are used, some patients with central lesions can be safely and effectively cured of early stage NSCLC. However, delivery of ablative doses of radiation to critical structures such as bronchial tree, esophagus, major vessels, heart, and the brachial plexus/phrenic nerve could produce severe, potentially lethal toxic effects.

The Ability to Diagnose Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma Definitively Using Novel Branched DNA-Enhanced Albumin RNA In Situ Hybridization Technology.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2014-12-18,"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) often is a diagnosis determined by exclusion. Distinguishing ICC from other metastatic adenocarcinomas based on histopathologic or immunohistochemical analysis often is difficult and requires an extensive workup. This study aimed to determine whether albumin, whose expression is restricted to the liver, has potential as a biomarker for ICC using a novel and highly sensitive RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) platform. Modified branched DNA probes were developed for albumin RNA ISH. The study evaluated 467 patient samples of primary and metastatic lesions. Of the 467 samples evaluated, 83 were ICCs, 42 were hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), and 332 were nonhepatic carcinomas including tumors arising from the perihilar region and bile duct, pancreas, stomach, esophagus, colon, breast, ovary, endometrium, kidney, and urinary bladder. Albumin RNA ISH was highly sensitive for cancers of liver origin, staining positive in 82 (99 %) of 83 ICCs and in 42 HCCs (100 %). Perihilar and distal bile duct carcinomas as well as carcinomas arising at other sites tested negative for albumin. Notably, 6 (22 %) of 27 intrahepatic tumors previously diagnosed as carcinomas of undetermined origin tested positive for albumin. Albumin RNA ISH is a sensitive and highly specific diagnostic tool for distinguishing ICC from metastatic adenocarcinoma to the liver or carcinoma of unknown origin.

"Expression, Clinical Significance, and Receptor Identification of the Newest B7 Family Member HHLA2 Protein.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2014-12-30,"HHLA2 (B7H7/B7-H5/B7y) is a newly identified B7 family member that regulates human T-cell functions. However, its protein expression in human organs and significance in human diseases are unknown. The objective of this study was to analyze HHLA2 protein expression in normal human tissues and cancers, as well as its prognostic significance, to explore mechanisms regulating HHLA2 expression, and to identify candidate HHLA2 receptors. An immunohistochemistry protocol and a flow cytometry assay with newly generated monoclonal antibodies were developed to examine HHLA2 protein. HHLA2 gene copy-number variation was analyzed from cancer genomic data. The combination of bioinformatics analysis and immunologic approaches was established to explore HHLA2 receptors. HHLA2 protein was detected in trophoblastic cells of the placenta and the epithelium of gut, kidney, gallbladder, and breast, but not in most other organs. In contrast, HHLA2 protein was widely expressed in human cancers from the breast, lung, thyroid, melanoma, pancreas, ovary, liver, bladder, colon, prostate, kidney, and esophagus. In a cohort of 50 patients with stage I-III triple-negative breast cancer, 56% of patients had aberrant expression of HHLA2 on their tumors, and high HHLA2 expression was significantly associated with regional lymph node metastasis and stage. The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that HHLA2 copy-number gains were present in 29% of basal breast cancers, providing a potential mechanism for increased HHLA2 protein expression in breast cancer. Finally, Transmembrane and Immunoglobulin Domain Containing 2 (TMIGD2) was identified as one of the receptors for HHLA2. Wide expression of HHLA2 in human malignancies, together with its association with poor prognostic factors and its T-cell coinhibitory capability, suggests that the HHLA2 pathway represents a novel immunosuppressive mechanism within the tumor microenvironment and an attractive target for human cancer therapy.",Journal Article,1848.0,43.0,HHLA2 B7H7/B7-H5/B7y is a newly identified B7 family member that regulates human T-cell functions However its protein expression in human organs and significance in human diseases are unknown The objective of this study was to analyze HHLA2 protein expression in normal human tissues and cancers as well as its prognostic significance to explore mechanisms regulating HHLA2 expression and to identify candidate HHLA2 receptors An immunohistochemistry protocol and a flow cytometry assay with newly generated monoclonal antibodies were developed to examine HHLA2 protein HHLA2 gene copy-number variation was analyzed from cancer genomic data The combination of bioinformatics analysis and immunologic approaches was established to explore HHLA2 receptors HHLA2 protein was detected in trophoblastic cells of the placenta and the epithelium of gut and but not in most other organs In contrast HHLA2 protein was widely expressed in human cancers from the ovary and In a cohort of 50 patients with stage I-III triple-negative cancer 56 of patients had aberrant expression of HHLA2 on their tumors and high HHLA2 expression was significantly associated with regional lymph node metastasis and stage The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that HHLA2 copy-number gains were present in 29 of basal cancers providing a potential mechanism for increased HHLA2 protein expression in cancer Finally Transmembrane and Immunoglobulin Domain Containing 2 TMIGD2 was identified as one of the receptors for HHLA2 Wide expression of HHLA2 in human malignancies together with its association with poor prognostic factors and its T-cell coinhibitory capability suggests that the HHLA2 pathway represents a novel immunosuppressive mechanism within the tumor microenvironment and an attractive target for human cancer therapy,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,"[11888, 65403, 3181, 19811, 65404, 16, 8, 732, 108, 3181, 607, 2693, 17, 2468, 171, 102, 31, 1681, 137, 211, 178, 55, 4, 171, 2285, 2, 724, 4, 171, 1342, 32, 860, 3, 461, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 1992, 11888, 178, 55, 4, 295, 171, 742, 2, 163, 22, 149, 22, 211, 177, 724, 6, 1645, 483, 2681, 11888, 55, 2, 6, 255, 1609, 11888, 1186, 35, 888, 1182, 2, 8, 1412, 1914, 719, 5, 732, 1419, 848, 890, 11, 276, 6, 1004, 11888, 178, 11888, 145, 1337, 207, 1380, 10, 311, 29, 12, 572, 74, 3, 150, 1, 6579, 65, 2, 3042, 611, 10, 635, 6, 1645, 11888, 1186, 11888, 178, 10, 530, 4, 11355, 37, 1, 3, 19600, 2, 3, 2781, 1, 7600, 2, 84, 44, 4, 96, 127, 2285, 4, 748, 11888, 178, 10, 1792, 570, 4, 171, 163, 29, 3, 3631, 2, 4, 8, 180, 1, 212, 7, 5, 82, 70, 316, 1500, 199, 12, 664, 1, 7, 42, 1898, 55, 1, 11888, 23, 136, 57, 2, 64, 11888, 55, 10, 97, 41, 5, 951, 263, 289, 278, 2, 82, 3, 12, 898, 2643, 553, 17, 11888, 1337, 207, 3849, 11, 364, 4, 462, 1, 2135, 163, 1736, 8, 174, 670, 9, 101, 11888, 178, 55, 4, 12, 1368, 5527, 2, 2593, 1398, 1101, 18, 48770, 10, 108, 22, 104, 1, 3, 1186, 9, 11888, 1019, 55, 1, 11888, 4, 171, 441, 1162, 5, 211, 248, 5, 334, 177, 130, 2, 211, 102, 31, 10928, 6188, 844, 17, 3, 11888, 308, 1449, 8, 229, 2989, 670, 262, 3, 30, 995, 2, 35, 3059, 283, 9, 171, 12, 36]",1797.0,25549724,98
Next-generation clinical trials: Novel strategies to address the challenge of tumor molecular heterogeneity.,Molecular oncology,Mol Oncol,2014-10-18,"The promise of 'personalized cancer care' with therapies toward specific molecular aberrations has potential to improve outcomes. However, there is recognized heterogeneity within any given tumor-type from patient to patient (inter-patient heterogeneity), and within an individual (intra-patient heterogeneity) as demonstrated by molecular evolution through space (primary tumor to metastasis) and time (after therapy). These issues have become hurdles to advancing cancer treatment outcomes with novel molecularly targeted agents. Classic trial design paradigms are challenged by heterogeneity, as they are unable to test targeted therapeutics against low frequency genomic 'oncogenic driver' aberrations with adequate power. Usual accrual difficulties to clinical trials are exacerbated by low frequencies of any given molecular driver. To address these challenges, there is need for innovative clinical trial designs and strategies implementing novel diagnostic biomarker technologies to account for inter-patient molecular diversity and scarce tissue for analysis. Importantly, there is also need for pre-defined treatment priority algorithms given numerous aberrations commonly observed within any one individual sample. Access to multiple available therapeutic agents simultaneously is crucial. Finally intra-patient heterogeneity through time may be addressed by serial biomarker assessment at the time of tumor progression. This report discusses various 'next-generation' biomarker-driven trial designs and their potentials and limitations to tackle these recognized molecular heterogeneity challenges. Regulatory hurdles, with respect to drug and companion diagnostic development and approval, are considered.

Comparison of Ray Tracing and Monte Carlo Calculation Algorithms for Thoracic Spine Lesions Treated With CyberKnife-Based Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy.,Technology in cancer research & treatment,Technol. Cancer Res. Treat.,2015-01-28,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is an emerging technology for the treatment of spinal metastases, although the dosimetric impact of the calculation method on spinal dose distribution is unknown. This study attempts to determine whether CyberKnife (CK)-based SBRT using a Ray Tracing (RyTc) algorithm is comparable dosimetrically to that of Monte Carlo (MC) for thoracic spinal lesions. Our institutional CK-based SBRT database for thoracic spinal lesions was queried and a cohort was generated. Patients were planned using RyTc and MC algorithms using the same beam angles and monitor units. Dose-volume histograms of the planning target volume (PTV), spinal cord, esophagus, and skin were generated, and dosimetric parameters were compared. There were 37 patients in the cohort. The average percentage volume of PTV covered by the prescribed dose with RyTc and MC algorithms was 91.1% and 80.4%, respectively (P < .001). The difference in average maximum spinal cord dose between RyTc and MC plans was significant (1126 vs 1084 cGy, P = .004), with the MC dose ranging from 18.7% below to 13.8% above the corresponding RyTc dose. A small reduction in maximum skin dose was also noted (P = .017), although no difference was seen in maximum esophageal dose (P = .15). Only PTVs smaller than 27 cm(3) were found to correlate with large (>10%) changes in dose to 90% of the volume (P = .014), while no correlates with the average percentage volume of PTV covered by the prescribed dose were demonstrated. For thoracic spinal CK-based SBRT, RyTc computation may overestimate the MC calculated average percentage volume of PTV covered by the prescribed dose and have unpredictable effects on doses to organs at risk, particularly the spinal cord. In this setting, use of RyTc optimization should be limited and always verified with MC.",Comparative Study,1819.0,6.0,Stereotactic body radiation therapy SBRT is an emerging technology for the treatment of spinal metastases although the dosimetric impact of the calculation method on spinal dose distribution is unknown This study attempts to determine whether CyberKnife CK -based SBRT using a Ray Tracing RyTc algorithm is comparable dosimetrically to that of Monte Carlo MC for thoracic spinal lesions Our institutional CK-based SBRT database for thoracic spinal lesions was queried and a cohort was generated Patients were planned using RyTc and MC algorithms using the same beam angles and monitor units Dose-volume histograms of the planning target volume PTV spinal cord and were generated and dosimetric parameters were compared There were 37 patients in the cohort The average percentage volume of PTV covered by the prescribed dose with RyTc and MC algorithms was 91.1 and 80.4 respectively P .001 The difference in average maximum spinal cord dose between RyTc and MC plans was significant 1126 vs 1084 cGy P .004 with the MC dose ranging from 18.7 below to 13.8 above the corresponding RyTc dose A small reduction in maximum dose was also noted P .017 although no difference was seen in maximum dose P .15 Only PTVs smaller than 27 cm 3 were found to correlate with large 10 changes in dose to 90 of the volume P .014 while no correlates with the average percentage volume of PTV covered by the prescribed dose were demonstrated For thoracic spinal CK-based SBRT RyTc computation may overestimate the MC calculated average percentage volume of PTV covered by the prescribed dose and have unpredictable effects on doses to organs at risk particularly the spinal cord In this setting use of RyTc optimization should be limited and always verified with MC,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[1729, 642, 121, 36, 1415, 16, 35, 1478, 2033, 9, 3, 24, 1, 1499, 196, 242, 3, 3187, 345, 1, 3, 6333, 596, 23, 1499, 61, 1395, 16, 860, 26, 45, 4374, 6, 223, 317, 16529, 4925, 90, 1415, 75, 8, 5520, 15457, 27419, 2124, 16, 1279, 17934, 6, 17, 1, 7990, 7991, 4779, 9, 2098, 1499, 406, 114, 1115, 4925, 90, 1415, 609, 9, 2098, 1499, 406, 10, 3547, 2, 8, 180, 10, 1419, 7, 11, 1465, 75, 27419, 2, 4779, 3529, 75, 3, 827, 1345, 16361, 2, 3334, 2960, 61, 433, 8638, 1, 3, 1349, 283, 433, 3303, 1499, 1885, 2, 11, 1419, 2, 3187, 1038, 11, 72, 125, 11, 567, 7, 4, 3, 180, 3, 1011, 1150, 433, 1, 3303, 4306, 20, 3, 2746, 61, 5, 27419, 2, 4779, 3529, 10, 970, 14, 2, 493, 39, 106, 19, 144, 3, 523, 4, 1011, 689, 1499, 1885, 61, 59, 27419, 2, 4779, 1853, 10, 93, 48824, 105, 33990, 3071, 19, 1520, 5, 3, 4779, 61, 2223, 29, 203, 67, 2736, 6, 233, 66, 2090, 3, 1734, 27419, 61, 8, 302, 628, 4, 689, 61, 10, 120, 1051, 19, 3825, 242, 77, 523, 10, 527, 4, 689, 61, 19, 167, 158, 13631, 2170, 76, 428, 494, 27, 11, 204, 6, 1513, 5, 375, 79, 400, 4, 61, 6, 424, 1, 3, 433, 19, 3618, 369, 77, 1871, 5, 3, 1011, 1150, 433, 1, 3303, 4306, 20, 3, 2746, 61, 11, 264, 9, 2098, 1499, 4925, 90, 1415, 27419, 19417, 68, 13271, 3, 4779, 981, 1011, 1150, 433, 1, 3303, 4306, 20, 3, 2746, 61, 2, 47, 8907, 176, 23, 415, 6, 2285, 28, 43, 823, 3, 1499, 1885, 4, 26, 546, 119, 1, 27419, 3980, 257, 40, 383, 2, 3763, 4815, 5, 4779]",1746.0,25633137,523
Smad4 loss in esophageal adenocarcinoma is associated with an increased propensity for disease recurrence and poor survival.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2015-04-01,"Previously regarded as a rare neoplasm, the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has risen rapidly in recent decades. It is often discovered late in the disease process and has a dismal prognosis. Current prognostic markers including clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic findings have limited utility and do not consider the biology of this deadly disease. Genome-wide analyses have identified SMAD4 inactivation in a subset of tumors. Although Smad4 has been extensively studied in other gastrointestinal malignancies, its role in esophageal adenocarcinoma remains to be defined. Herein, we show, in a large cohort of esophageal adenocarcinomas, Smad4 loss by immunohistochemistry in 21 of 205 (10%) tumors and that Smad4 loss correlated with increased postoperative recurrence (P=0.040). Further, patients whose tumors lacked Smad4 had shorter time to recurrence (TTR) (P=0.007) and poor overall survival (OS) (P=0.011). The median TTR and OS of patients with Smad4-negative tumors was 13 and 16 months, respectively, as compared with 23 and 22 months, respectively, among patients with Smad4-positive tumors. In multivariate analyses, Smad4 loss was a prognostic factor for both TTR and OS, independent of histologic grade, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, tumor stage, and lymph node status. Considering Smad4 loss correlated with postoperative locoregional and/or distant metastases, Smad4 was also assessed in a separate cohort of 5 locoregional recurrences and 43 metastatic esophageal adenocarcinomas. In contrast to primary tumors, a higher prevalence of Smad4 loss was observed in metastatic disease (44% vs. 10%). In summary, loss of Smad4 protein expression is an independent prognostic factor for TTR and OS that correlates with increased propensity for disease recurrence and poor survival in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma after surgical resection.

Comparative effectiveness in esophagogastric cancer.,Cancer treatment and research,Cancer Treat. Res.,2015-01-01,"Cancer of the esophagus and the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) continues to have a dismal prognosis, with the incidence of esophageal cancer increasing in the United States. Although radical resection was initially the primary treatment for this disease process, systemic chemotherapy and radiation have been shown to play a role in prolonging survival in most patient populations. This chapter explores the evidence that guides treatment for esophageal and GEJ cancer today. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy were introduced as treatment modalities for esophageal and GEJ cancers when it became evident that surgical therapy alone provided poor long-term survival rates. A variety of treatment strategies have been explored including preoperative (neoadjuvant) and postoperative (adjuvant) chemotherapy, with and without radiation. The evidence suggests that neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy provides better outcomes compared to surgery alone for esophageal, GEJ, and gastric cancers. Studies indicate a trend towards improved survival when neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is compared to chemotherapy alone. When patients have undergone resection with node-positive disease without receiving neoadjuvant therapy, some form of adjuvant treatment is recommended. This chapter also explores the surgical management of esophageal, GEJ, and gastric cancers including the extent of the gastric lymph node dissection. It also includes a discussion about adherence to national guidelines in terms of gastric cancer treatment and esophageal and gastric lymph node examinations.

Dietary alterations and restrictions following surgery for upper gastrointestinal cancers: Key components of a health-related quality of life intervention.,European journal of oncology nursing : the official journal of European Oncology Nursing Society,Eur J Oncol Nurs,2015-02-17,"The surgical treatment of upper gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, specifically esophageal and gastric cancers, often result in extensive health-related quality of life (HRQOL) concerns, particularly those associated with dietary adjustments. This paper provides a review of HRQOL changes following esophagectomy and gastrectomy, and describes key components of an intervention to improve dietary adjustments following surgery. Intervention development was informed by 1) current published evidence on HRQOL changes for patients following upper GI surgery, 2) examination of usual post-operative care related to dietary restrictions to identify areas for continued education and support and 3) the inclusion of a conceptual framework (the Chronic Care Model) to guide intervention design and inform the selection of appropriate outcome measures. Three key components of an HRQOL intervention are identified, and should focus on HRQOL concerns associated with dietary alterations and restrictions following treatment, involve family caregivers, and be tailored and flexible to patient and family caregiver's needs and preferences.

Incidence and predictors of severe acute esophagitis and subsequent esophageal stricture in patients treated with accelerated hyperfractionated chemoradiation for limited-stage small cell lung cancer.,Practical radiation oncology,Pract Radiat Oncol,2015-02-26,"Clinical and dosimetric predictors of severe (grade 3 or greater) acute esophageal toxicity and subsequent esophageal dilation were explored in patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer treated with accelerated hyperfractionated chemoradiation. A total of 130 patients were identified who were treated to 45 Gy in 1.5-Gy twice-daily fractions with concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy between 2000 and 2009. Data on clinical, disease-related, and treatment-related variables were collected. Patients with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube insertion or intravenous hydration because of poor oral intake were designated as having acute grade 3 esophagitis. Univariate and multivariate analyses that associated treatment characteristics with esophagitis were assessed via logistic regression, and optimal cut points were identified with recursive partitioning analysis. Twenty-five patients developed severe acute esophagitis, at a rate of 26% (18/69) in patients treated with earlier 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy techniques and 11.5% (7/61) in patients treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy techniques and omission of elective nodal irradiation. The incidence of esophageal stricture was 6% overall (8 of 128 eligible) but 26% (6/23) among those who experienced prior grade 3 acute esophagitis and 2% (2/105) among those with acute esophagitis less than or equal to grade 2. Significant multivariate predictors of acute esophagitis were mean dose and volume of esophagus receiving at least 5% to 35% of the prescribed dose (V5 to V40). Patients with V5 ≥ 74% had a 44.4% risk of severe acute esophagitis (12/27) versus 12.6% (13/103) among those with V5 < 74%. V45 was the only dosimetric predictor for esophageal stricture, with 13.7% of patients in whom V45 was ≥37.5% requiring subsequent dilation. Modern radiation techniques are associated with a lower frequency of severe acute esophagitis than previous paradigms. The proportion of esophagus receiving low- to moderate-range doses (mean, V5 through V40) predicts acute esophagitis, whereas the proportion of esophagus that receives high doses (V45) predicts the development of esophageal stricture that requires dilation. Patients who develop grade 3 acute esophagitis are at significant risk for subsequent esophageal stricture, whereas those with acute esophagitis of grade 2 or less display minimal risk.",Journal Article,1790.0,7.0,Clinical and dosimetric predictors of severe grade 3 or greater acute toxicity and subsequent dilation were explored in patients with limited-stage small cell cancer treated with accelerated hyperfractionated chemoradiation A total of 130 patients were identified who were treated to 45 Gy in 1.5-Gy twice-daily fractions with concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy between 2000 and 2009 Data on clinical disease-related and treatment-related variables were collected Patients with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube insertion or intravenous hydration because of poor oral intake were designated as having acute grade 3 esophagitis Univariate and multivariate analyses that associated treatment characteristics with esophagitis were assessed via logistic regression and optimal cut points were identified with recursive partitioning analysis Twenty-five patients developed severe acute esophagitis at a rate of 26 18/69 in patients treated with earlier 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy techniques and 11.5 7/61 in patients treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy techniques and omission of elective nodal irradiation The incidence of stricture was 6 overall 8 of 128 eligible but 26 6/23 among those who experienced prior grade 3 acute esophagitis and 2 2/105 among those with acute esophagitis less than or equal to grade 2 Significant multivariate predictors of acute esophagitis were mean dose and volume of receiving at least 5 to 35 of the prescribed dose V5 to V40 Patients with V5 ≥ 74 had a 44.4 risk of severe acute esophagitis 12/27 versus 12.6 13/103 among those with V5 74 V45 was the only dosimetric predictor for stricture with 13.7 of patients in whom V45 was ≥37.5 requiring subsequent dilation Modern radiation techniques are associated with a lower frequency of severe acute esophagitis than previous paradigms The proportion of receiving low- to moderate-range doses mean V5 through V40 predicts acute esophagitis whereas the proportion of that receives high doses V45 predicts the development of stricture that requires dilation Patients who develop grade 3 acute esophagitis are at significant risk for subsequent stricture whereas those with acute esophagitis of grade 2 or less display minimal risk,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[38, 2, 3187, 674, 1, 905, 88, 27, 15, 378, 286, 155, 2, 706, 8062, 11, 1443, 4, 7, 5, 383, 82, 302, 31, 12, 73, 5, 2241, 6201, 975, 8, 181, 1, 3431, 7, 11, 108, 54, 11, 73, 6, 512, 381, 4, 14, 33, 381, 936, 391, 1550, 5, 750, 828, 90, 56, 59, 1081, 2, 1238, 74, 23, 38, 34, 139, 2, 24, 139, 682, 11, 786, 7, 5, 3720, 2056, 6983, 2330, 5099, 15, 1262, 8517, 408, 1, 334, 518, 1514, 11, 4107, 22, 1041, 286, 88, 27, 5135, 880, 2, 331, 318, 17, 41, 24, 374, 5, 5135, 11, 275, 847, 812, 320, 2, 665, 3554, 862, 11, 108, 5, 4493, 4515, 65, 737, 365, 7, 276, 905, 286, 5135, 28, 8, 116, 1, 432, 203, 790, 4, 7, 73, 5, 1677, 27, 2201, 2972, 121, 36, 1092, 2, 175, 33, 67, 713, 4, 7, 73, 5, 837, 1757, 121, 36, 1092, 2, 5736, 1, 4700, 779, 1104, 3, 287, 1, 6673, 10, 49, 63, 66, 1, 3990, 625, 84, 432, 49, 382, 107, 135, 54, 592, 324, 88, 27, 286, 5135, 2, 18, 18, 3263, 107, 135, 5, 286, 5135, 299, 76, 15, 2997, 6, 88, 18, 93, 331, 674, 1, 286, 5135, 11, 313, 61, 2, 433, 1, 357, 28, 506, 33, 6, 465, 1, 3, 2746, 61, 10234, 6, 12454, 7, 5, 10234, 749, 794, 42, 8, 584, 39, 43, 1, 905, 286, 5135, 133, 428, 185, 133, 49, 233, 3283, 107, 135, 5, 10234, 794, 16984, 10, 3, 158, 3187, 980, 9, 6673, 5, 233, 67, 1, 7, 4, 953, 16984, 10, 65709, 33, 1888, 706, 8062, 2366, 121, 1092, 32, 41, 5, 8, 280, 675, 1, 905, 286, 5135, 76, 698, 4887, 3, 920, 1, 357, 154, 6, 1163, 184, 415, 313, 10234, 298, 12454, 2623, 286, 5135, 547, 3, 920, 1, 17, 17285, 64, 415, 16984, 2623, 3, 193, 1, 6673, 17, 1706, 8062, 7, 54, 690, 88, 27, 286, 5135, 32, 28, 93, 43, 9, 706, 6673, 547, 135, 5, 286, 5135, 1, 88, 18, 15, 299, 3640, 1048, 43]",2247.0,25731965,592
The Hippo Coactivator YAP1 Mediates EGFR Overexpression and Confers Chemoresistance in Esophageal Cancer.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2015-03-04,"Esophageal cancer is an aggressive malignancy and often resistant to therapy. Overexpression of EGFR has been associated with poor prognosis of patients with esophageal cancer. However, clinical trials using EGFR inhibitors have not provided benefit for patients with esophageal cancer. Failure of EGFR inhibition may be due to crosstalk with other oncogenic pathways. In this study, expression of YAP1 and EGFR were examined in EAC-resistant tumor tissues versus sensitive tissues by IHC. Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence, real-time PCR, promoter analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and in vitro and in vivo functional assays were performed to elucidate the YAP1-mediated EGFR expression and transcription and the relationship with chemoresistance in esophageal cancer. We demonstrate that Hippo pathway coactivator YAP1 can induce EGFR expression and transcription in multiple cell systems. Both YAP1 and EGFR are overexpressed in resistant esophageal cancer tissues compared with sensitive esophageal cancer tissues. Furthermore, we found that YAP1 increases EGFR expression at the level of transcription requiring an intact TEAD-binding site in the EGFR promoter. Most importantly, exogenous induction of YAP1 induces resistance to 5-fluorouracil and docetaxcel, whereas knockdown of YAP1 sensitizes esophageal cancer cells to these cytotoxics.

Distribution of Resistant Esophageal Adenocarcinoma in the Resected Specimens of Clinical Stage III Patients after Chemoradiation: Its Clinical Implications.,Oncology,Oncology,2015-03-05,"We have limited knowledge of the geographic distribution of resistant esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in resected specimens, but its clinical importance can be enormous.

A total of 100 clinical stage III patients were studied; 90% had an R0 resection, and 99% had either moderate or poorly differentiated EAC. Twelve percent had >50% residual cancer, 31% had 11-50% residual cancer, 53% had 1-10% residual cancer, and 3% had positive nodes only. Each compartment was frequently involved: mucosa/submucosa (66%), muscularis propria (76%), and serosa (62%); all compartments were involved in 35% of the cases. Lack of EAC (meaning response) was observed in the mucosa/submucosa (34%), muscularis propria (24%), serosa (38%), and nodes (42%). Although the endoscopic biopsies prior to surgery showed no EAC in 79% of the patients, in the surgical specimens, resistant EAC was frequently occurring in the mucosa/submucosa (66%).

Differences Between Colon Cancer Primaries and Metastases Using a Molecular Assay for Tumor Radiation Sensitivity Suggest Implications for Potential Oligometastatic SBRT Patient Selection.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol.

The purpose of this study was to assess differences between RSI scores in primary colon cancer and metastases. Patients were identified from our institutional review board-approved prospective observational protocol. A total of 704 metastatic and 1362 primary lesions were obtained from a de-identified metadata pool. RSI was calculated using the previously published rank-based algorithm. An independent cohort of 29 lung or liver colon metastases treated with 60 Gy in 5 fractions stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) was used for validation. The most common sites of metastases included liver (n=374; 53%), lung (n=116; 17%), and lymph nodes (n=40; 6%). Sixty percent of metastatic tumors, compared with 54% of primaries, were in the RSI radiation-resistant peak, suggesting metastatic tumors may be slightly more radiation resistant than primaries (P=.01). In contrast, when we analyzed metastases based on anatomical site, we uncovered large differences in RSI. The median RSIs for metastases in descending order of radiation resistance were ovary (0.48), abdomen (0.47), liver (0.43), brain (0.42), lung (0.32), and lymph nodes (0.31) (P<.0001). These findings were confirmed when the analysis was restricted to lesions from the same patient (n=139). In our independent cohort of treated lung and liver metastases, lung metastases had an improved local control rate compared to that in patients with liver metastases (2-year local control rate of 100% vs 73.0%, respectively; P=.026).

Role of Repeat 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography Examination in Predicting Pathologic Response Following Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy for Esophageal Adenocarcinoma.,JAMA surgery,JAMA Surg,2015-06-01,"Predicting complete pathologic response (CPR) preoperatively can significantly affect surgical decision making. There are conflicting data regarding positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET CT) characteristics and the ability of PET CT to predict pathologic response following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in esophageal adenocarcinoma because most existing studies that include squamous histology have limited numbers and use nonstandardized PET CT imaging. To determine if PET CT characteristics are associated with CPR in patients undergoing trimodality treatment for esophageal adenocarcinoma. A retrospective medical record review was conducted at a large tertiary cancer center from a prospectively maintained database from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2012. Inclusion criteria were patients undergoing esophagectomy for locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma post-neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with 2 standardized PET CT studies done at our institution (pre-neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and post-neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy) for review. Data collected included clinical, pathologic, imaging, and treatment characteristics. The primary study outcome was the association of PET CT characteristics with histologic confirmed pathologic response. Of the total participants, 77 patients met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-two patients (28.6%) had CPR vs 55 patients (71.4%) who had incomplete pathologic response. The 2 groups were similar in age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbid conditions, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status, tumor grade, chemotherapy, and radiation regimen and days between the 2 PET CTs. The mean prestandardized uptake variable (SUV; 14.5 vs 11.2; P = .05), δ SUV (10.3 vs 5.4; P = .02), and relative δ SUV (0.6 vs 0.4; P = .02) were significantly higher in those with CPR vs incomplete pathologic response. Using the Youden Index, a δ SUV value less than 45% was predictive of residual disease with a positive predictive value of 91.7% (95% CI, 73-99; P < .05).

Doubling of 30-Day Mortality by 90 Days After Esophagectomy: A Critical Measure of Outcomes for Quality Improvement.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2016-02-01,"Our objectives were to (1) compare 30- and 90-day mortality rates after esophagectomy, (2) compare drivers of 30- and 90-day mortality, and (3) examine whether 90-day mortality affects hospital rankings. Operative mortality has traditionally been assessed at 30 days. Ninety-day mortality has been suggested as a more appropriate indicator of quality, particularly after complex cancer surgery. Esophagectomies for nonmetastatic esophageal cancer patients diagnosed between 2007 and 2011 were identified in the National Cancer Data Base. Mortality rates were examined by patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and hospital procedural volume. Risk-adjusted hierarchical logistic regression models examined hospital performance for mortality. A total of 15,796 esophagectomy patients at 977 hospitals were available for analysis. Ninety-day overall mortality was more than double the 30-day mortality (8.9% vs 4.2%; P < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, while both 30- and 90-day mortality were associated with patient factors such as age, comorbidity, and hospital volume, only 90-day mortality was influenced by tumor- and management-related variables such as stage, tumor location, and receipt of neoadjuvant therapy. Hospital performance was examined as top 10%, middle 10% to 90%, and lowest 10% as ranked using risk-adjusted odds of mortality. There was moderate correlation between ranking based on 30- and 90-day mortality [weighted κ = 0.45 (95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.52)]. Compared with 30-day mortality rankings, nearly 20% of hospitals changed their ranking category when 90-day mortality rankings were used. Examination of 90-day mortality after esophagectomy reflects cancer patient management decisions and may provide actionable targets for quality improvement.",Evaluation Study,1450.0,28.0,"Our objectives were to 1 compare 30- and 90-day mortality rates after esophagectomy 2 compare drivers of 30- and 90-day mortality and 3 examine whether 90-day mortality affects hospital rankings Operative mortality has traditionally been assessed at 30 days Ninety-day mortality has been suggested as a more appropriate indicator of quality particularly after complex cancer surgery Esophagectomies for nonmetastatic cancer patients diagnosed between 2007 and 2011 were identified in the National Cancer Data Base Mortality rates were examined by patient demographics tumor characteristics and hospital procedural volume Risk-adjusted hierarchical logistic regression models examined hospital performance for mortality A total of 15,796 esophagectomy patients at 977 hospitals were available for analysis Ninety-day overall mortality was more than double the 30-day mortality 8.9 vs 4.2 P 0.0001 In multivariate analysis while both 30- and 90-day mortality were associated with patient factors such as age comorbidity and hospital volume only 90-day mortality was influenced by tumor- and management-related variables such as stage tumor location and receipt of neoadjuvant therapy Hospital performance was examined as top 10 middle 10 to 90 and lowest 10 as ranked using risk-adjusted odds of mortality There was moderate correlation between ranking based on 30- and 90-day mortality weighted κ 0.45 95 confidence interval 0.39-0.52 Compared with 30-day mortality rankings nearly 20 of hospitals changed their ranking category when 90-day mortality rankings were used Examination of 90-day mortality after esophagectomy reflects cancer patient management decisions and may provide actionable targets for quality improvement",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[114, 2409, 11, 6, 14, 932, 201, 2, 424, 218, 282, 151, 50, 3617, 18, 932, 3391, 1, 201, 2, 424, 218, 282, 2, 27, 1004, 317, 424, 218, 282, 2561, 702, 17820, 1208, 282, 71, 4206, 85, 275, 28, 201, 162, 2493, 218, 282, 71, 85, 1148, 22, 8, 80, 870, 3287, 1, 372, 823, 50, 840, 12, 152, 25338, 9, 2683, 12, 7, 265, 59, 1307, 2, 1132, 11, 108, 4, 3, 657, 12, 74, 1782, 282, 151, 11, 409, 20, 69, 2221, 30, 374, 2, 702, 8492, 433, 43, 586, 4466, 812, 320, 274, 409, 702, 528, 9, 282, 8, 181, 1, 167, 11656, 3617, 7, 28, 16407, 1987, 11, 390, 9, 65, 2493, 218, 63, 282, 10, 80, 76, 1627, 3, 201, 218, 282, 66, 83, 105, 39, 18, 19, 13, 488, 4, 331, 65, 369, 110, 201, 2, 424, 218, 282, 11, 41, 5, 69, 130, 225, 22, 89, 1879, 2, 702, 433, 158, 424, 218, 282, 10, 2574, 20, 30, 2, 284, 139, 682, 225, 22, 82, 30, 1147, 2, 1699, 1, 536, 36, 702, 528, 10, 409, 22, 3150, 79, 3897, 79, 6, 424, 2, 2101, 79, 22, 6441, 75, 43, 586, 610, 1, 282, 125, 10, 1163, 816, 59, 11185, 90, 23, 201, 2, 424, 218, 282, 2337, 4627, 13, 512, 48, 307, 268, 13, 587, 13, 653, 72, 5, 201, 218, 282, 17820, 1857, 179, 1, 1987, 2368, 136, 11185, 2169, 198, 424, 218, 282, 17820, 11, 95, 1385, 1, 424, 218, 282, 50, 3617, 5224, 12, 69, 284, 1526, 2, 68, 377, 2856, 637, 9, 372, 767]",1724.0,25915912,27
Automated frame selection process for high-resolution microendoscopy.,Journal of biomedical optics,J Biomed Opt,2015-04-01,"We developed an automated frame selection algorithm for high-resolution microendoscopy video sequences. The algorithm rapidly selects a representative frame with minimal motion artifact from a short video sequence, enabling fully automated image analysis at the point-of-care. The algorithm was evaluated by quantitative comparison of diagnostically relevant image features and diagnostic classification results obtained using automated frame selection versus manual frame selection. A data set consisting of video sequences collected in vivo from 100 oral sites and 167 esophageal sites was used in the analysis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.78 (automated selection) versus 0.82 (manual selection) for oral sites, and 0.93 (automated selection) versus 0.92 (manual selection) for esophageal sites.

Between March 2006 and April 2011, 53 patients with advanced malignant solid tumors were enrolled and treated with elisidepsin on the two different q3wk infusion schedules: 22 (30-min) and 31 (3-h), respectively. Doses evaluated ranged from 0.1 to 1.6 mg/m(2) (30-min q3wk) and from 2.0 to 11.0 mg flat dose (FD) (3-h q3wk). In the 30-min q3wk schedule, transient grade 3/4 increases in hepatic transaminases were the DLT, which appeared at the highest doses tested (from 1.1 to 1.6 mg/m(2)). No DLTs were observed on the 3-h schedule at doses up to 11.0 mg q3wk. Common adverse events were grade 1/2 pruritus, nausea, fatigue and hypersensitivity. Of note, myelotoxicity was not observed.

Pharmacol.,2015-05-13,"Our study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of everolimus in patients with pre-treated metastatic gastric and esophagus cancers in a US-based population focusing on biomarker correlation. Patients with advanced upper GI adenocarcinomas who progressed after 1-2 prior regimens received everolimus 10 mg PO daily. The primary endpoint was disease control rate (DCR). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity, overall survival (OS) and biomarker correlatives of the mTOR pathway. Target accrual was 50 patients based on one-sided type I error of 10 % and power of 90 %. Forty-five patients were evaluable, 21 gastric, 11 esophagus and 13 from the GEJ. The median age was 64 (range 38-73); all patients had an ECOG of 0 or 1; and 18 patients (40 %) had only 1 prior regimen. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events included fatigue (24 %) and thrombocytopenia (22 %). We observed 1 partial response with 39 % of evaluable patients having stable disease. Median OS was 3.4 months (95 % CI 2.7-5.6 months), and PFS was 1.8 months (95 % CI 1.7-2.2 months). There was a strong correlation between ≥2 + IHC staining for p-S6 in tumor samples with better PFS (p < 0.0001) and DCR (p = 0.0001). Our clinical outcomes were inferior to the Asian studies, which may be explained by disease heterogeneity. However, there was a similar strong correlation between clinical benefit and tumor high pS6.

Identification of Serum Markers of Esophageal Adenocarcinoma by Global and Targeted Metabolic Profiling.,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,Clin. Gastroenterol. Hepatol.,2015-05-19,"We aimed to identify new serum biomarkers of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). We performed metabolomic analyses of serum samples from 2 sets of case-control pairs in the discovery phase, each consisting of 30 patients with histologically confirmed EAC (cases) from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and 30 matched subjects without EAC (controls). We identified metabolites whose levels differed significantly between cases and controls and validated those with the greatest difference in an analysis of 321 EAC cases and 331 controls. We generated a metabolite risk score (MRS) for the metabolites. The levels of 64 metabolites differed significantly between EAC cases and controls in the discovery phase. The metabolites with the greatest difference were amino acid L-proline (LP), ketone body 3-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), and carbohydrate D-mannose (DM); these differences were confirmed in the validation set. Cases had lower mean levels of LP than controls (22.78 ± 6.79 μg/mL vs 28.24 ± 8.64 μg/mL; P < .001) and higher levels of BHBA (18.06 ± 17.84 μg/mL vs 7.73 ± 9.92 μg/mL; P < .001) and DM (9.87 ± 4.28 μg/mL vs 6.28 ± 3.61 μg/mL; P < .001). Levels of DM were significantly higher in patients with late-stage EAC than early-stage EAC (10.61 ± 4.79 μg/mL vs 8.97 ± 3.36 μg/mL; P = .005). Higher levels of LP were associated with significant decrease in risk of EAC (odds ratio [OR], 0.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18-0.38). A significant increase in risk of EAC was associated with higher levels of BHBA (OR, 4.05; 95% CI, 2.84-5.78) and DM (OR, 7.04; 95% CI, 4.79-10.34). Levels of all 3 metabolites associated with EAC risk in a dose response manner; the level of risk conferred by the metabolites increased jointly with smoking status and body mass index. Individuals with high MRS had significant (7.76-fold) increase in risk of EAC vs those with low MRS. Smokers with high MRS had the greatest risk of EAC (OR, 23.40; 95% CI, 10.95-50.00), compared with never smokers with low MRS. On the basis of a case vs control metabolic profile analysis, levels of LP, BHBA, and DM are associated with risk of EAC.

Dose-Volume Predictors of Esophagitis After Thoracic Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy.,American journal of clinical oncology,Am. J. Clin. Oncol.,2017-10-01,"Esophageal toxicity has become a major concern as stereotactic hypofractionated radiation therapy is increasingly utilized for central pulmonary tumors. Our purpose was to define esophageal dosimetric parameters that predict potentially dose-limiting toxicities. In total, 157 patients with a planning target volume ≤5 cm from the esophagus were selected from an institutional database. Toxicity was scored with the CTCAE v4.0. Esophageal Dmax and Dv (dose D in Gy covering volume v in mL) in 0.5 mL increments were collected. Corresponding biologically effective dose (BED) was calculated for α/β=10,3 (BED10, BED3). Normal tissue complication probability was computed with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy parameters and equivalent dose in 2 Gy per fraction (EQD2). Dosimetric predictors were identified with multivariate logistic regression with a manual forward stepwise selection technique. The grade≥2 esophagitis rate was 5.7%. BED10 to 1.5 mL was the best predictor of esophagitis. BED10 to 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 3.5 mL were also predictive but less strong. Results were similar when BED3 and physical dose were examined. Tumor-esophageal distance correlated with esophagitis (10.5% risk of≥grade 2 events with distance≤3.9 cm vs. 1.3% when>3.9 cm, P=0.016). BED10 to 1.5 mL correlated well with EQD2 normal tissue complication probability estimates. BED to 1.5 mL was the strongest predictor of grade≥2 esophagitis (independent of α/β ratio) with a 10.6% toxicity risk when BED10>21.1 Gy (14.3 Gy in 3 fractions, 16.0 Gy in 5).

"Imaging of Secreted Extracellular Periostin, an Important Marker of Invasion in the Tumor Microenvironment in Esophageal Cancer.","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",J. Nucl. Med.,2015-06-11,"Periostin, an extracellular matrix protein, plays key role in cell adhesion and motility within the tumor microenvironment and is correlated with tumor invasion. We developed and characterized a PET tracer that specifically targets periostin and evaluated the probe in preclinical models of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal studies. Antiperiostin-F(ab')2 was generated from a monoclonal antibody by enzymatic digestion, conjugated to DOTA, and labeled with (64)Cu. Human ESCC cell lines, TE-11 with high and TT with minimal periostin expression, were implanted in nu/nu mice to generate the positive and control tumor models, respectively. PET/CT imaging was performed at 6, 12, and 24 h and organ-specific biodistribution at 24 h after probe injection. Additionally the probe was tested in a genetically engineered mouse model of periostin-expressing distal esophageal/forestomach ESCC. Tissue microarrays of esophageal neoplasms and ESCC as well as extracted tumor samples were stained for periostin. We generated a (64)Cu-DOTA-anti-periostin-F(ab')2 with a dissociation constant of 29.2 ± 3.0 nM. PET/CT images and biodistribution studies showed significantly higher tracer uptake in TE-11 than TT tumors (maximum standardized uptake value, 24 h: 0.67 ± 0.09 vs. 0.36 ± 0.03, P < 0.0005; percentage injected dose per gram, 24 h: 3.24 ± 0.65 vs. 1.63 ± 0.49, P < 0.0001). In genetically engineered mouse models, ESCC high periostin tracer uptake anatomically correlated with the (18)F-FDG uptake at the gastroesophageal junction. All of the ESCC cores and 96.2% of adenocarcinoma stained positive for periostin, with most stained strongly (67.3% and 69.3%, respectively). We demonstrated that specific imaging of extracellular matrix periostin in ESCC is feasible using a targeted PET tracer.

Epithelial PD-L2 Expression Marks Barrett's Esophagus and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma.,Cancer immunology research,Cancer Immunol Res,2015-06-16,"Esophageal adenocarcinoma is an increasingly common disease with a dismal 5-year survival rate of 10% to 15%. In the first systematic evaluation of the PD-1 pathway in esophageal adenocarcinoma, we identify expression of PD-L2 in cancer cells in 51.7% of esophageal adenocarcinomas. Epithelial PD-L1 was expressed on only 2% of cases, although PD-L1(+) immune cells were observed in 18% of esophageal adenocarcinomas. We also evaluated expression in the precursor lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma, Barrett's esophagus, which emerges following gastric reflux-induced esophageal inflammation, and found PD-L2 expression in Barrett's esophagus but not in non-Barrett's esophagus esophagitis. Because the progression from squamous esophagitis to Barrett's esophagus is accompanied by a transition from a TH1 to TH2 immune response, we hypothesized that the TH2 cytokines IL4/IL13 could contribute to PD-L2 induction.

Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy with Cervical Anastomosis.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2015-06-17,"This video demonstrates our technique for a minimally invasive esophagectomy with side-to-side stapled cervical esophagogastric anastomosis. This technique is routinely utilized in most patients undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal or gastroesophageal junction malignancy, excluding type III gastroesophageal junction tumors. Absolute contraindications include significant tumor involvement of the fundus which may necessitate an intrathoracic anastomosis. Relative contraindications include poor pulmonary function or prior extensive surgical history that may either preclude surgery altogether or prevent the ability of the conduit from reaching the cervical region, or could preclude utilization of a minimally invasive approach. We have not found large body habitus to be an absolute contraindication for this approach. The technique involves thoracoscopic mobilization of the esophagus, laparoscopic dissection of the stomach and creation of gastric conduit, and creation of a 6 cm side-to-side stapled cervical esophagogastric anastomosis. The pylorus is treated with a botox injection; routine pyloroplasty is not performed.

Expert Consensus Contouring Guidelines for Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy in Esophageal and Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2015-04-02,"Current guidelines for esophageal cancer contouring are derived from traditional 2-dimensional fields based on bony landmarks, and they do not provide sufficient anatomic detail to ensure consistent contouring for more conformal radiation therapy techniques such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Therefore, we convened an expert panel with the specific aim to derive contouring guidelines and generate an atlas for the clinical target volume (CTV) in esophageal or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer. Eight expert academically based gastrointestinal radiation oncologists participated. Three sample cases were chosen: a GEJ cancer, a distal esophageal cancer, and a mid-upper esophageal cancer. Uniform computed tomographic (CT) simulation datasets and accompanying diagnostic positron emission tomographic/CT images were distributed to each expert, and the expert was instructed to generate gross tumor volume (GTV) and CTV contours for each case. All contours were aggregated and subjected to quantitative analysis to assess the degree of concordance between experts and to generate draft consensus contours. The panel then refined these contours to generate the contouring atlas. The κ statistics indicated substantial agreement between panelists for each of the 3 test cases. A consensus CTV atlas was generated for the 3 test cases, each representing common anatomic presentations of esophageal cancer. The panel agreed on guidelines and principles to facilitate the generalizability of the atlas to individual cases. This expert panel successfully reached agreement on contouring guidelines for esophageal and GEJ IMRT and generated a reference CTV atlas. This atlas will serve as a reference for IMRT contours for clinical practice and prospective trial design.

Endoscopic Ultrasound Estimates for Tumor Depth at the Gastroesophageal Junction Are Inaccurate: Implications for the Liberal Use of Endoscopic Resection.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2015-07-30,"Endoscopic resection is increasingly utilized for treating early stage esophageal cancer, and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) frequently guides treatment selection. Studies report greater than 80% sensitivity and 90% specificity, but our experience suggests less accuracy at the gastroesophageal (GE) junction. The objective of this study is to determine the accuracy of EUS for depth of GE junction cancer and the potential treatment implications. A retrospective review of a prospective database was performed for patients from 1995 to 2014 with GE junction esophageal cancer that underwent EUS staging and resection (surgical or endoscopic) without neo-adjuvant therapy. Patient, tumor, EUS, and pathologic characteristics were examined. For the 181 patients that met criteria, the median age was 66 years, 17% were female, 91% white, and 98% had adenocarcinoma. Concordance between EUS (u) T and pathologic (p) T was 48%, with 23% under-staged and 29% over-staged. The EUS was accurate in the following: uT0 6% (1 of 18); uT1a 56% (23 of 41); uT1b 58% (41 of 71); uT2 10% (2 of 21); and uT3 70% (21 of 30). Inaccurate EUS depth had potential to lead to over-treatment in 38% (27 of 71) of uT1b and 76% (16 of 21) of uT2. In 50% of pT1a tumors, EUS depth was T1b or greater.

ABT-263 induces apoptosis and synergizes with chemotherapy by targeting stemness pathways in esophageal cancer.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2015-09-01,"Activation of cancer stem cell signaling is central to acquired resistance to therapy in esophageal cancer (EC). ABT-263, a potent Bcl-2 family inhibitor, is active against many tumor types. However, effect of ABT-263 on EC cells and their resistant counterparts are unknown. Here we report that ABT-263 inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in human EC cells and their chemo-resistant counterparts. The combination of ABT-263 with 5-FU had synergistic lethal effects and amplified apoptosis that does not depend fully on its inhibition of BCL-2 family proteins in EC cells. To further explore the novel mechanisms of ABT-263, proteomic array (RPPAs) were performed and gene set enriched analysis demonstrated that ABT-263 suppresses the expression of many oncogenes including genes that govern stemness pathways. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence further confirmed reduction in protein expression and transcription in Wnt/β-catenin and YAP/SOX9 axes. Furthermore, ABT263 strongly suppresses cancer stem cell properties in EC cells and the combination of ABT-263 and 5-FU significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo and suppresses the expression of stemness genes. Thus, our findings demonstrated a novel mechanism of ABT-263 antitumor effect in EC and indicating that combination of ABT-263 with cytotoxic drugs is worthy of pursuit in patients with EC.

Comprehensive Genomic Profiling of Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinomas and Esophageal Adenocarcinomas Reveals Similarities and Differences.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2015-09-02,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) and esophageal adenocarcinomas (EACs) account for >95% of esophageal malignancies and represent a major global health burden. ESCC is the dominant histology globally but represents a minority of U.S. cases, with EAC accounting for the majority of U.S. The patient outcomes for advanced ESCC and EAC are poor, and new therapeutic options are needed. Using a sensitive sequencing assay, we compared the genomic profiles of ESCC and EAC with attention to identification of therapeutically relevant genomic alterations. Next-generation sequencing-based comprehensive genomic profiling was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation-based libraries to a median coverage depth of >650× for all coding exons of 315 cancer-related genes plus selected introns from 28 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. Results from a single sample were evaluated for all classes of genomic alterations (GAs) including point mutations, short insertions and deletions, gene amplifications, homozygous deletions, and fusions/rearrangements. Clinically relevant genomic alterations (CRGAs) were defined as alterations linked to approved drugs and those under evaluation in mechanism-driven clinical trials. There were no significant differences by sex for either tumor type, and the median age for all patients was 63 years. All ESCCs and EACs were at an advanced stage at the time of sequencing. All 71 ESCCs and 231 EACs featured GAs on profiling, with 522 GAs in ESCC (7.4 per sample) and 1,303 GAs in EAC (5.6 per sample). The frequency of clinically relevant GAs in ESCC was 94% (2.6 per sample) and 93% in EAC (2.7 per sample). CRGAs occurring more frequently in EAC included KRAS (23% EAC vs. 6% ESCC) and ERBB2 (23% EAC vs. 3% ESCC). ESCC samples were enriched for CRGA in PIK3CA (24% ESCC vs. 10% EAC), PTEN (11% ESCC vs. 4% EAC), and NOTCH1 (17% ESCC vs. 3% EAC).

Clinical implications of basic research in hepatocellular carcinoma.,Journal of hepatology,J. Hepatol.,2015-10-09,"A 58-year old Caucasian female has compensated hepatitis C related cirrhosis. Her surveillance ultrasound showed hypodense liver nodules and subsequent triple phase CT scan showed five tumor nodules with diameters ranging from 3-5cms involving both hepatic lobes. The nodules showed characteristic radiologic findings on the CT scan and she was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on non-invasive criteria. There was also associated right portal vein tumor thrombosis. Her functional capacity at diagnosis was slightly limited, but she was capable of performing all activities of daily living and self-care. Her laboratory tests at diagnosis were as follows: sodium 129mmol/L, potassium 3.6mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 22mg/dL, creatinine 1.0mg/dL, albumin 2.9g/dl, bilirubin 1.8mg/dl, alanine aminotransferase 87U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 68U/L, alkaline phosphatase 139U/L, white blood cell 3.5x10(9)/L, hemoglobin 10.4, platelet count 73x10(9)/L, international normalized ratio 1.9 and alpha-fetoprotein 5200ng/ml. An upper endoscopy was negative for esophageal or gastric varices. Based on the tumor burden, presence of macrovascular invasion, ECOG performance status of 1 and Child-Pugh class A she was classified to have BCLC stage C HCC. She was started on sorafenib therapy at 400mg oral twice daily but unfortunately this had to be discontinued since she experienced severe diarrhea and skin rash. She now returns for follow-up and requests information on the available therapeutic options. This particular case scenario is not uncommon and does raise several clinically relevant questions: This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of HCC management and also examines the clinical implications of recent basic research in HCC.

"Phase Ib Randomized, Double-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled, Dose Escalation Study of Polyphenon E in Patients with Barrett's Esophagus.","Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",Cancer Prev Res (Phila),2015-10-15,"This study was conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of the green tea-derived Polyphenon E (Poly E) in patients with Barrett's Esophagus (BE). Subjects were randomized to a 6-month, twice daily (BID) oral treatment of placebo or Poly E (200, 400, or 600 mg). Endoscopic evaluation, including biopsies, was performed before and after treatment. The primary objective was to demonstrate safety; secondary objectives investigated catechin accumulation and effects in clinical specimens. Of the 44 enrolled subjects, 11 received placebo, and 33 received Poly E. No dose-limiting toxicities were encountered, and a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached. The recommended phase II dose was 600 mg twice daily. The most common treatment-related adverse events (AE) in Poly E-treated subjects were grade I and II nausea, grade I belching, and grade I lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) elevation. No treatment-related AEs were reported in placebo-treated subjects, aside from grade I laboratory abnormalities. Pill counts and subject diaries were not consistently collected, and compliance was difficult to determine. However, on the basis of an intention-to-treat analysis, there was a significant relationship between Poly E dose and esophageal EGCG level--mean changes (pmol/g) of 0.79 (placebo), 6.06 (200 mg), 35.67 (400 mg), and 34.95 (600 mg); P = 0.005. There was a possible relationship between Poly E dose and urine PGE-M concentration. In conclusion, Poly E was well-tolerated, and treatment with Poly E (400 and 600 mg) but not Poly E (200 mg) or placebo resulted in clinically relevant and detectable EGCG accumulation in the target organ, esophageal mucosa.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",1559.0,16.0,This study was conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of the green tea-derived Polyphenon E Poly E in patients with Barrett 's BE Subjects were randomized to a 6-month twice daily BID oral treatment of placebo or Poly E 200 400 or 600 mg Endoscopic evaluation including biopsies was performed before and after treatment The primary objective was to demonstrate safety secondary objectives investigated catechin accumulation and effects in clinical specimens Of the 44 enrolled subjects 11 received placebo and 33 received Poly E.

Association Between Clinically Staged Node-Negative Esophageal Adenocarcinoma and Overall Survival Benefit From Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation.,JAMA surgery,JAMA Surg,2016-03-01,"While neoadjuvant chemoradiation for esophageal cancer improves oncologic outcomes for a broad group of patients with locally advanced and/or node-positive tumors, it is less clear which specific subset of patients derives most benefit in terms of overall survival (OS). To determine whether neoadjuvant chemoradiation based on esophageal adenocarcinoma histology has similar oncologic outcomes for patients treated with surgery alone when stratified by clinical nodal status. A retrospective analysis using the American College of Surgeons National Cancer Database from 1998 to 2006. Patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma histology and clinical stage T1bN1-N3 or T2-T4aN-/+M0 were divided into 2 treatment groups: (1) neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery and (2) surgery alone. Subset analysis within each treatment group was performed for clinically node-negative patients (cN-) vs node-positive patients (cN+) in conjunction with pathological nodal status. A propensity score-adjusted analysis, which included patient demographics, comorbidity status, and clinical T stage, was also performed. The primary outcome was 3-year OS. Secondary outcomes included margin status, postoperative length of stay, unplanned readmission rate, and 30-day mortality. A total of 1309 patients were identified, of whom 539 received neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery and 770 received surgery alone. Of the 1309 patients, 41.2% (n = 539) received neoadjuvant chemoradiation and 47.2% (n = 618) were cN+. Median follow-up for the entire cohort was 73.3 months (interquartile range, 64.1-93.5 months). The 3-year OS was better for neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery compared with surgery alone (49% vs 38%, respectively; P < .001). Stratifying based on clinical nodal status, the propensity score-adjusted OS was significantly better for cN+ patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation (hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.42-0.66; P < .001). In contrast, there was no difference in OS for cN- patients based on treatment (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.65-1.10; P = .22).

Current concepts and future potential in neoadjuvant chemotherapy for esophageal cancer.,Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,Expert Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol,2015-12-02,"Many trials have evaluated preoperative chemotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer (LAEC). Most studies were small with conflicting results and no clear evidence of survival advantage. However, two large trials that included squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus produced opposite outcomes with one showing limited benefit and the other showing none. Recent meta-analyses suggest only a modest benefit from induction chemotherapy in the treatment of LAEC. Two factors associated with prolonged survival are: (1) an R0 resection and (2) pathological complete remission. Preoperative chemotherapy is preferred in Europe for adenocarcinomas; however, chemoradiation has been the treatment of choice in the US. The individualization and optimization of therapy for esophageal cancer patients may come from an in-depth understanding of molecular biology and the development of predictive biomarkers. The use of targeted and immunotherapy agents in the preoperative setting are also promising and warrant further evaluation.

Nationwide analysis of short-term surgical outcomes of minimally invasive esophagectomy for malignancy.,"International journal of surgery (London, England)",Int J Surg,2015-11-18,"Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) is being increasingly utilized for esophageal cancer. It is unclear if MIE if being safely performed with satisfactory outcomes across the USA. We aimed to analyze the short-term surgical outcomes of MIE as compared to open esophagectomy (OE). The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried for patients who underwent MIE or OE for esophageal malignancy between 2010 and 2011. Margin positivity, lymph node retrieval, 30-day mortality, 30-day unplanned readmission rate and hospital length of stay. A total of 4047 patients were identified; 3050 (75.4%) underwent OE, and 997 (24.6%) underwent MIE. The proportion of MIE increased from 21.9% in 2010 to 27.4% in 2011 (p < 0.001). The conversion rate was 13.7%. There were no differences in-patient or tumor characteristics between the two cohorts. OE and MIE were comparable in terms of margin positive resection rate (7.4% vs. 8.1%, p = 0.48), 30-day unplanned readmission rate (7.6% vs. 7.2%, p = 0.64) and 30-day mortality rate (4.3% vs. 3.3%, p = 0.71). Compared to OE, MIE was associated with higher node retrieval (median 12 vs 14, p < 0.001), and shorter hospital stay (median 11.0 vs 10.0 days, p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that surgical approach (OE vs MIE) was not associated with 30-day mortality rate. In an ANCOVA analysis, MIE was independently associated with a shorter hospital stay compared to OE (estimated mean difference 1.57 ± 0.53 days, p = 0.003). MIE patients who underwent conversion had a longer hospital stay compared to those who did not (11.0 vs 10.0 days, p = 0.02).

Pretreatment Dysphagia in Esophageal Cancer Patients May Eliminate the Need for Staging by Endoscopic Ultrasonography.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2015-10-23,"Neoadjuvant therapy is commonly administered to patients with localized disease who have T3-4 esophageal disease as staged by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). Previously, we noted that patients who present with dysphagia have a higher EUS T stage. We hypothesized that the presence of dysphagia is predictive of EUS T3-4 disease and that staging EUS could be forgone for esophageal cancer patients with dysphagia. We performed a prospective, intent-to-treat, single-cohort study in which patients with potentially resectable esophageal cancer completed a standardized four-tier dysphagia score survey. EUS was performed as part of our standard evaluation. To determine whether the presence of dysphagia predicted EUS T3-4 disease, the dysphagia score was compared with EUS T stage. The study enrolled 114 consecutive patients between August 2012 and February 2014: 77% (88 of 114) received neoadjuvant therapy, 18% (20 of 114) did not, and 5% (6 of 114) pursued treatment elsewhere. In total, 70% (80 of 114) underwent esophagectomy; of these, 54% (61 of 114) had dysphagia and 46% (53 of 114) did not. Dysphagia scores were 66% (40 of 61) grade 1, 25% (15 of 61) grade 2, and 10% (6 of 61) grade 3 to 4. Among patients with dysphagia, 89% (54 of 61) had T3-4 disease by EUS; among those without dysphagia, only 53% (28 of 53) had T3-4 disease by EUS (p < 0.001).

Outcomes With Open and Minimally Invasive Ivor Lewis Esophagectomy After Neoadjuvant Therapy.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2015-12-01,"Neoadjuvant therapy is integral in the treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer. Despite increasing acceptance of minimally invasive approaches to esophagectomy, there remain concerns about the safety and oncologic soundness after neoadjuvant therapy. We examined outcomes in patients undergoing open and minimally invasive (MIE) Ivor Lewis esophagectomy after neoadjuvant therapy. This was a retrospective series of 130 consecutive patients with esophageal cancer undergoing Ivor Lewis esophagectomy with curative intention after neoadjuvant therapy at a tertiary academic center (2008 to 2012). An open procedure was performed in 74 patients (56.9%), and 56 (43.1%) underwent MIE after neoadjuvant therapy. MIE patients had shorter median intensive care unit (p = 0.002) and hospital lengths of stay (p < 0.0001). The incidence of postoperative complications was similar (open: 54.8% vs MIE: 41.1%, p = 0.155). However, observed respiratory complications were significantly reduced after MIE (8.9%) compared with open (29.7%; p = 0.004). Anastomotic leak rates were similar (open: 1.4% vs. MIE: 0%, p = 1.00). Mortality at 30 and 90 days was comparable (open: 2.7% and 4.1% vs MIE: 0% and 1.8%, p = 0.506 and p = 0.634, respectively). Complete resection rates and the number of collected lymph nodes was similar. Overall survival rates at 5 years were similar (open: 61% vs MIE: 50%, p = 0.933). MIE was not a significant predictor of overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 0.61 to 1.87; p = 0.810). MIE proves its safety after neoadjuvant therapy because it leads to faster progression during the early postoperative period while reducing pulmonary complications. Open and MIE approaches appear equivalent with regards to perioperative oncologic outcomes after neoadjuvant therapy. Long-term outcomes need further validation.",Comparative Study,1512.0,25.0,Neoadjuvant therapy is integral in the treatment of locally advanced cancer Despite increasing acceptance of minimally invasive approaches to esophagectomy there remain concerns about the safety and oncologic soundness after neoadjuvant therapy We examined outcomes in patients undergoing open and minimally invasive MIE Ivor Lewis esophagectomy after neoadjuvant therapy This was a retrospective series of 130 consecutive patients with cancer undergoing Ivor Lewis esophagectomy with curative intention after neoadjuvant therapy at a tertiary academic center 2008 to 2012 An open procedure was performed in 74 patients 56.9 and 56 43.1 underwent MIE after neoadjuvant therapy MIE patients had shorter median intensive care unit p 0.002 and hospital lengths of stay p 0.0001 The incidence of postoperative complications was similar open 54.8 vs MIE 41.1 p 0.155 However observed respiratory complications were significantly reduced after MIE 8.9 compared with open 29.7 p 0.004 Anastomotic leak rates were similar open 1.4 vs. MIE 0 p 1.00 Mortality at 30 and 90 days was comparable open 2.7 and 4.1 vs MIE 0 and 1.8 p 0.506 and p 0.634 respectively Complete resection rates and the number of collected lymph nodes was similar Overall survival rates at 5 years were similar open 61 vs MIE 50 p 0.933 MIE was not a significant predictor of overall survival hazard ratio 1.07 95 confidence interval 0.61 to 1.87 p 0.810 MIE proves its safety after neoadjuvant therapy because it leads to faster progression during the early postoperative period while reducing pulmonary complications Open and MIE approaches appear equivalent with regards to perioperative oncologic outcomes after neoadjuvant therapy Long-term outcomes need further validation,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[536, 36, 16, 4450, 4, 3, 24, 1, 795, 131, 12, 550, 602, 5080, 1, 2144, 416, 611, 6, 3617, 125, 918, 2061, 545, 3, 367, 2, 1998, 67292, 50, 536, 36, 21, 409, 123, 4, 7, 479, 1020, 2, 2144, 416, 7336, 14776, 9449, 3617, 50, 536, 36, 26, 10, 8, 459, 988, 1, 3431, 935, 7, 5, 12, 479, 14776, 9449, 3617, 5, 1075, 3205, 50, 536, 36, 28, 8, 2557, 1916, 574, 1375, 6, 1195, 35, 1020, 1299, 10, 173, 4, 794, 7, 664, 83, 2, 664, 601, 14, 208, 7336, 50, 536, 36, 7336, 7, 42, 985, 52, 1686, 165, 2712, 19, 13, 1111, 2, 702, 7443, 1, 2020, 19, 13, 488, 3, 287, 1, 573, 521, 10, 288, 1020, 667, 66, 105, 7336, 605, 14, 19, 13, 3735, 137, 164, 2718, 521, 11, 97, 405, 50, 7336, 66, 83, 72, 5, 1020, 462, 67, 19, 13, 1520, 4818, 4238, 151, 11, 288, 1020, 14, 39, 105, 7336, 13, 19, 14, 2038, 282, 28, 201, 2, 424, 162, 10, 1279, 1020, 18, 67, 2, 39, 14, 105, 7336, 13, 2, 14, 66, 19, 13, 9454, 2, 19, 13, 10277, 106, 236, 170, 151, 2, 3, 207, 1, 786, 263, 502, 10, 288, 63, 25, 151, 28, 33, 60, 11, 288, 1020, 713, 105, 7336, 212, 19, 13, 17986, 7336, 10, 44, 8, 93, 980, 1, 63, 25, 360, 197, 14, 1615, 48, 307, 268, 13, 713, 6, 14, 912, 19, 13, 13882, 7336, 19482, 211, 367, 50, 536, 36, 408, 192, 1940, 6, 5308, 91, 190, 3, 191, 573, 727, 369, 1818, 1087, 521, 1020, 2, 7336, 611, 1322, 2017, 5, 8930, 6, 1547, 1998, 123, 50, 536, 36, 319, 337, 123, 594, 195, 929]",1741.0,26652140,32
Effectiveness of Chinese herbal medicine for cancer palliative care: overview of systematic reviews with meta-analyses.,Scientific reports,Sci Rep,2015-12-16,"Chinese herbal medicines (CHM) are often used in managing cancer related symptoms but their effectiveness and safety is controversial. We conducted this overview of meta-analyses to summarize evidence on CHM for cancer palliative care. We included systematic reviews (SRs) with meta-analyses of CHM clinical trials on patients diagnosed with any type of cancer. Methodological quality of included meta-analyses was assessed with the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) Instrument. Fifty-one SRs with meta-analyses were included. They covered patients with lung (20 SRs), gastric (8 SRs), colorectal (6 SRs), liver (6 SRs), breast (2 SRs), cervical (1 SR), esophageal (1 SR), and nasopharyngeal (1 SR) cancers. Six SRs summarized evidence on various types of cancer. Methodological quality of included meta-analyses was not satisfactory. Overall, favorable therapeutic effects in improving quality of life among cancer patients have been reported. Conflicting evidence exists for the effectiveness of CHM in prolonging survival and in reducing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy related toxicities. No serious adverse effects were reported in all included studies. Evidence indicated that CHM could be considered as an option for improving quality of life among patients receiving palliative care.

Survival in Patients With Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Undergoing Trimodality Therapy Is Independent of Regional Lymph Node Location.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2015-12-08,"The American Joint Committee on Cancer Cancer Staging Manual 7th Edition esophageal cancer staging was derived from outcomes of patients undergoing esophagectomy alone and eliminated nodal location from its schema. A limitation of this staging system is that it has not been validated in the setting of multimodality therapy for esophageal cancer. In addition, nodal location continues to influence treatment decisions. The aim of our study was to evaluate outcomes of patients with distal esophageal or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma undergoing trimodality therapy and assess the effect of nodal location on survival. This multiinstitutional retrospective study assessed patients with clinically node-positive (cN+) distal esophageal/GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with trimodality therapy between January 2002 and December 2011. Nodal stations were classified as paratracheal, subcarinal, celiac, lower esophageal, paraaortic, supraclavicular, or perigastric/perihepatic. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify variables associated with OS. A total of 196 cN+ patients met the study criteria. The most prevalent metastatic nodal location was in the perigastric region, present in 141 patients (72%); paratracheal nodal involvement was present in 19 patients (10%). None of the nodal stations was significantly associated with OS on univariable analysis. Multivariable analysis identified age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.036; p = 0.001), male sex (HR, 2.39; p = 0.003), pathologic ypT3 (HR, 1.81; p = 0.048), and ypN3 (HR, 2.93; p = 0.003) as being significantly associated with survival.

The 3-Hole Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy: A Safe Procedure Following Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Radiation.,Seminars in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,Semin. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg.,2015-06-20,"Induction therapy followed by esophagectomy has become standard for treatment of intermediate-stage esophageal cancer in many centers. Herein we evaluate the feasibility and safety of the 3-hole minimally invasive esophagectomy (3HMIE) approach in patients who received induction radiation and chemotherapy. Between 2003 and 2012, the records of 119 consecutive patients with esophageal cancer who underwent 3HMIE were reviewed for perioperative complications and long-term outcomes. Comparison was made between procedures performed for patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiation and patients who were treated with only surgery. Of them, 78 patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiation and 41 patients were treated with only surgery. Tumor locations were upper (2), middle (16), distal (64), and gastroesophageal junction (37). In all, 76 patients were at clinical stage IIA or above at presentation. Increased requirement for blood replacement in the induction therapy group was significant compared with the surgery-only group. Operative time, estimated blood loss, proximal and distal margin lengths, and length of stay were not significantly different between the cohorts. There was a 30-day perioperative death (0.8%), and this patient was from the surgery-only group. No conduit necrosis or need for diversion was recorded. Overall, 5-year survival was 62% among the 107 patients with early-stage esophageal cancer. 3HMIE is feasible with low mortality and acceptable morbidity even in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who received neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. Overall perioperative and survival outcomes are similar to or better than those reported in the published literature on esophagectomy after induction therapy.

Radiation modality use and cardiopulmonary mortality risk in elderly patients with esophageal cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2015-12-30,"It is currently unclear whether the superior normal organ-sparing effect of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) compared with 3-dimensional radiotherapy (3D) has a clinical impact on survival and cardiopulmonary mortality in patients with esophageal cancer (EC). The authors identified 2553 patients aged > 65 years from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare and Texas Cancer Registry-Medicare databases who had nonmetastatic EC diagnosed between 2002 and 2009 and were treated with either 3D (2240 patients) or IMRT (313 patients) within 6 months of diagnosis. The outcomes of the 2 cohorts were compared using inverse probability of treatment weighting adjustment. Except for marital status, year of diagnosis, and SEER region, both radiation cohorts were well balanced with regard to various patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics, including the use of IMRT versus 3D in urban/metropolitan or rural areas. IMRT use increased from 2.6% in 2002 to 30% in 2009, whereas the use of 3D decreased from 97.4% in 2002 to 70% in 2009. On propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting-adjusted multivariate analysis, IMRT was not found to be associated with EC-specific mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.93; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.80-1.10) or pulmonary mortality (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.37-3.36), but was significantly associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72-0.95), cardiac mortality (HR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.06-0.54), and other-cause mortality (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.35-0.84). Similar associations were noted after adjusting for the type of chemotherapy, physician experience, and sensitivity analysis removing hybrid radiation claims.

A Nomogram to Predict Distant Metastases After Multimodality Therapy for Patients With Localized Esophageal Cancer.,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,2016-02-01,"Among patients with localized esophageal cancer (LEC), 35% or more develop distant metastases (DM) as first relapse, most in the first 24 months after local therapy. Implementation of novel strategies may be possible if DM can be predicted reliably. We hypothesized that clinical variables could help generate a DM nomogram. Patients with LEC who completed multimodality therapy were analyzed. Various statistical methods were used, including multivariate analysis to generate a nomogram. A concordance index (c-index) was established and validated using the bootstrap method. Among 629 patients analyzed (356 trimodality/273 bimodality), 36% patients developed DM as first relapse. The median overall survival from DM was only 8.6 months (95% CI, 7.0-10.2). In a multivariate analysis, the variables associated with a higher risk for developing DM were poorly differentiated histology (hazard ratio [HR], 1.76; P<.0001), baseline T3/T4 primary (HR, 3.07; P=.0006), and baseline N+ LEC (HR, 2.01; P<.0001).

Motion-robust intensity-modulated proton therapy for distal esophageal cancer.,Medical physics,Med Phys,2016-03-01,"To develop methods for evaluation and mitigation of dosimetric impact due to respiratory and diaphragmatic motion during free breathing in treatment of distal esophageal cancers using intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT). This was a retrospective study on 11 patients with distal esophageal cancer. For each patient, four-dimensional computed tomography (4D CT) data were acquired, and a nominal dose was calculated on the average phase of the 4D CT. The changes of water equivalent thickness (ΔWET) to cover the treatment volume from the peak of inspiration to the valley of expiration were calculated for a full range of beam angle rotation. Two IMPT plans were calculated: one at beam angles corresponding to small ΔWET and one at beam angles corresponding to large ΔWET. Four patients were selected for the calculation of 4D-robustness-optimized IMPT plans due to large motion-induced dose errors generated in conventional IMPT. To quantitatively evaluate motion-induced dose deviation, the authors calculated the lowest dose received by 95% (D95) of the internal clinical target volume for the nominal dose, the D95 calculated on the maximum inhale and exhale phases of 4D CT DCT0 andDCT50 , the 4D composite dose, and the 4D dynamic dose for a single fraction. The dose deviation increased with the average ΔWET of the implemented beams, ΔWETave. When ΔWETave was less than 5 mm, the dose error was less than 1 cobalt gray equivalent based on DCT0 and DCT50 . The dose deviation determined on the basis of DCT0 and DCT50 was proportionally larger than that determined on the basis of the 4D composite dose. The 4D-robustness-optimized IMPT plans notably reduced the overall dose deviation of multiple fractions and the dose deviation caused by the interplay effect in a single fraction. In IMPT for distal esophageal cancer, ΔWET analysis can be used to select the beam angles that are least affected by respiratory and diaphragmatic motion. To further reduce dose deviation, the 4D-robustness optimization can be implemented for IMPT planning. Calculation of DCT0 and DCT50 is a conservative method to estimate the motion-induced dose errors.",Journal Article,1421.0,19.0,To develop methods for evaluation and mitigation of dosimetric impact due to respiratory and diaphragmatic motion during free breathing in treatment of distal cancers using intensity-modulated proton therapy IMPT This was a retrospective study on 11 patients with distal cancer For each patient four-dimensional computed tomography 4D CT data were acquired and a nominal dose was calculated on the average phase of the 4D CT The changes of water equivalent thickness ΔWET to cover the treatment volume from the peak of inspiration to the valley of expiration were calculated for a full range of beam angle rotation Two IMPT plans were calculated one at beam angles corresponding to small ΔWET and one at beam angles corresponding to large ΔWET Four patients were selected for the calculation of 4D-robustness-optimized IMPT plans due to large motion-induced dose errors generated in conventional IMPT To quantitatively evaluate motion-induced dose deviation the authors calculated the lowest dose received by 95 D95 of the internal clinical target volume for the nominal dose the D95 calculated on the maximum inhale and exhale phases of 4D CT DCT0 andDCT50 the 4D composite dose and the 4D dynamic dose for a single fraction The dose deviation increased with the average ΔWET of the implemented beams ΔWETave When ΔWETave was less than 5 mm the dose error was less than 1 cobalt gray equivalent based on DCT0 and DCT50 The dose deviation determined on the basis of DCT0 and DCT50 was proportionally larger than that determined on the basis of the 4D composite dose The 4D-robustness-optimized IMPT plans notably reduced the overall dose deviation of multiple fractions and the dose deviation caused by the interplay effect in a single fraction In IMPT for distal cancer ΔWET analysis can be used to select the beam angles that are least affected by respiratory and diaphragmatic motion To further reduce dose deviation the 4D-robustness optimization can be implemented for IMPT planning Calculation of DCT0 and DCT50 is a conservative method to estimate the motion-induced dose errors,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[6, 690, 636, 9, 451, 2, 14292, 1, 3187, 345, 520, 6, 2718, 2, 15311, 2967, 190, 115, 8540, 4, 24, 1, 2107, 163, 75, 837, 1757, 2095, 36, 5534, 26, 10, 8, 459, 45, 23, 175, 7, 5, 2107, 12, 9, 296, 69, 294, 2201, 1220, 872, 5321, 425, 74, 11, 1294, 2, 8, 8948, 61, 10, 981, 23, 3, 1011, 124, 1, 3, 5321, 425, 3, 400, 1, 4388, 2017, 2903, 32568, 6, 8308, 3, 24, 433, 29, 3, 2944, 1, 13104, 6, 3, 17624, 1, 19656, 11, 981, 9, 8, 1647, 184, 1, 1345, 8939, 6566, 100, 5534, 1853, 11, 981, 104, 28, 1345, 16361, 1734, 6, 302, 32568, 2, 104, 28, 1345, 16361, 1734, 6, 375, 32568, 294, 7, 11, 715, 9, 3, 6333, 1, 5321, 7031, 4039, 5534, 1853, 520, 6, 375, 2967, 277, 61, 4612, 1419, 4, 809, 5534, 6, 5889, 376, 2967, 277, 61, 3348, 3, 738, 981, 3, 2101, 61, 103, 20, 48, 12669, 1, 3, 2329, 38, 283, 433, 9, 3, 8948, 61, 3, 12669, 981, 23, 3, 689, 29195, 2, 27090, 3523, 1, 5321, 425, 36200, 67719, 3, 5321, 3308, 61, 2, 3, 5321, 2540, 61, 9, 8, 226, 1509, 3, 61, 3348, 101, 5, 3, 1011, 32568, 1, 3, 3426, 7821, 49599, 198, 49599, 10, 299, 76, 33, 321, 3, 61, 3444, 10, 299, 76, 14, 17789, 4163, 2017, 90, 23, 36200, 2, 41361, 3, 61, 3348, 509, 23, 3, 877, 1, 36200, 2, 41361, 10, 11142, 1077, 76, 17, 509, 23, 3, 877, 1, 3, 5321, 3308, 61, 3, 5321, 7031, 4039, 5534, 1853, 2552, 405, 3, 63, 61, 3348, 1, 232, 1550, 2, 3, 61, 3348, 1546, 20, 3, 5709, 254, 4, 8, 226, 1509, 4, 5534, 9, 2107, 12, 32568, 65, 122, 40, 95, 6, 1717, 3, 1345, 16361, 17, 32, 506, 1424, 20, 2718, 2, 15311, 2967, 6, 195, 969, 61, 3348, 3, 5321, 7031, 3980, 122, 40, 3426, 9, 5534, 1349, 6333, 1, 36200, 2, 41361, 16, 8, 4476, 596, 6, 1191, 3, 2967, 277, 61, 4612]",2085.0,26936698,444

J. Clin. Oncol.,2017-08-01,"Preoperative chemotherapy and radiation for localized esophageal cancer produces cure rates near 30% when combined with surgical resection. Vandetanib, a small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, RET, and EGFR, demonstrated synergy with radiation and chemotherapy in preclinical models. We conducted a phase I study to assess the safety and tolerability of vandetanib when combined with preoperative chemoradiation in patients with localized esophageal carcinoma who were surgical candidates. Patients with stage II-III esophageal and gastroesophageal junction carcinoma without prior therapy were enrolled in a 3+3 phase I design. Patients received once-daily vandetanib (planned dosing levels of 100, 200, and 300 mg) with concomitant daily radiotherapy (1.8 Gy/d, 45 Gy total) and chemotherapy, consisting of infusional 5-FU (225 mg/m/d over 96 h, weekly), paclitaxel (50 mg/m, days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29) and carboplatin (AUC of 5, days 1, 29). A total 9 patients were enrolled with 8 having either distal esophageal or gastroesophageal junction carcinomas. All patients completed the planned preoperative chemoradiation and underwent esophagectomy. Nausea (44%) and anorexia (44%) were the most common acute toxicities of any grade. One grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity was observed (gastrobronchial fistula). One additional patient suffered a late complication, a fatal aortoenteric hemorrhage, not definitively related to the investigational regimen. Five (56%) patients achieved a pathologic complete response. Three (33%) additional patients had only microscopic residual disease. Five (56%) patients remain alive and disease free with a median follow-up of 3.7 years and median overall survival of 3.2 years. The maximum tolerated dose was vandetanib 100 mg/d. Vandetanib at 100 mg daily is tolerable in combination with preoperative chemotherapy (5-FU, paclitaxel, carboplatin) and radiation therapy with encouraging efficacy worthy of future study.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",903.0,0.0,Preoperative chemotherapy and radiation for localized cancer produces cure rates near 30 when combined with surgical resection Vandetanib a small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFR-2 VEGFR-3 RET and EGFR demonstrated synergy with radiation and chemotherapy in preclinical models We conducted a phase I study to assess the safety and tolerability of vandetanib when combined with preoperative chemoradiation in patients with localized carcinoma who were surgical candidates Patients with stage II-III and gastroesophageal junction carcinoma without prior therapy were enrolled in a 3+3 phase I design Patients received once-daily vandetanib planned dosing levels of 100 200 and 300 mg with concomitant daily radiotherapy 1.8 Gy/d 45 Gy total and chemotherapy consisting of infusional 5-FU 225 mg/m/d over 96 h weekly paclitaxel 50 mg/m days 1 8 15 22 29 and carboplatin AUC of 5 days 1 29 A total 9 patients were enrolled with 8 having either distal or gastroesophageal junction carcinomas All patients completed the planned preoperative chemoradiation and underwent esophagectomy Nausea 44 and anorexia 44 were the most common acute toxicities of any grade One grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity was observed gastrobronchial fistula One additional patient suffered a late complication a fatal aortoenteric hemorrhage not definitively related to the investigational regimen Five 56 patients achieved a pathologic complete response Three 33 additional patients had only microscopic residual disease Five 56 patients remain alive and disease free with a median follow-up of 3.7 years and median overall survival of 3.2 years The maximum tolerated dose was vandetanib 100 mg/d Vandetanib at 100 mg daily is tolerable in combination with preoperative chemotherapy 5-FU paclitaxel carboplatin and radiation therapy with encouraging efficacy worthy of future study,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[498, 56, 2, 121, 9, 909, 12, 4042, 1722, 151, 1829, 201, 198, 397, 5, 221, 170, 3493, 8, 302, 1354, 153, 564, 216, 230, 1, 2134, 18, 2134, 27, 2412, 2, 227, 264, 3439, 5, 121, 2, 56, 4, 693, 274, 21, 426, 8, 124, 70, 45, 6, 423, 3, 367, 2, 1543, 1, 3493, 198, 397, 5, 498, 975, 4, 7, 5, 909, 134, 54, 11, 221, 1931, 7, 5, 82, 215, 316, 2, 3227, 3322, 134, 187, 324, 36, 11, 346, 4, 8, 27, 27, 124, 70, 771, 7, 103, 1059, 391, 3493, 1465, 1280, 148, 1, 394, 1250, 2, 2036, 81, 5, 1781, 391, 310, 14, 66, 381, 427, 512, 381, 181, 2, 56, 2273, 1, 4825, 33, 1296, 4011, 81, 188, 427, 252, 921, 555, 709, 490, 212, 81, 188, 162, 14, 66, 167, 350, 462, 2, 927, 1376, 1, 33, 162, 14, 462, 8, 181, 83, 7, 11, 346, 5, 66, 1041, 361, 2107, 15, 3227, 3322, 826, 62, 7, 781, 3, 1465, 498, 975, 2, 208, 3617, 1218, 584, 2, 3373, 584, 11, 3, 96, 186, 286, 385, 1, 500, 88, 104, 88, 39, 3534, 155, 10, 164, 67823, 4920, 104, 402, 69, 6388, 8, 807, 1447, 8, 3034, 67824, 3599, 44, 6008, 139, 6, 3, 3093, 477, 365, 664, 7, 513, 8, 510, 236, 51, 169, 466, 402, 7, 42, 158, 2984, 753, 34, 365, 664, 7, 918, 1701, 2, 34, 115, 5, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 27, 67, 60, 2, 52, 63, 25, 1, 27, 18, 60, 3, 689, 421, 61, 10, 3493, 394, 81, 427, 3493, 28, 394, 81, 391, 16, 2668, 4, 150, 5, 498, 56, 33, 1296, 490, 927, 2, 121, 36, 5, 2269, 209, 8083, 1, 508, 45]",1872.0,26986978,85
"CRLX101 nanoparticles localize in human tumors and not in adjacent, nonneoplastic tissue after intravenous dosing.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2016-03-21,"Nanoparticle-based therapeutics are being used to treat patients with solid tumors. Whereas nanoparticles have been shown to preferentially accumulate in solid tumors of animal models, there is little evidence to prove that intact nanoparticles localize to solid tumors of humans when systemically administered. Here, tumor and adjacent, nonneoplastic tissue biopsies are obtained through endoscopic capture from patients with gastric, gastroesophageal, or esophageal cancer who are administered the nanoparticle CRLX101. Both the pre- and postdosing tissue samples adjacent to tumors show no definitive evidence of either the nanoparticle or its drug payload (camptothecin, CPT) contained within the nanoparticle. Similar results are obtained from the predosing tumor samples. However, in nine of nine patients that were evaluated, CPT is detected in the tumor tissue collected 24-48 h after CRLX101 administration.

Improving Outcomes for Esophageal Cancer using Proton Beam Therapy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2015-12-14,"Radiation therapy (RT) plays an essential role in the management of esophageal cancer. Because the esophagus is a centrally located thoracic structure there is a need to balance the delivery of appropriately high dose to the target while minimizing dose to nearby critical structures. Radiation dose received by these critical structures, especially the heart and lungs, may lead to clinically significant toxicities, including pneumonitis, pericarditis, and myocardial infarction. Although technological advancements in photon RT delivery like intensity modulated RT have decreased the risk of such toxicities, a growing body of evidence indicates that further risk reductions are achieved with proton beam therapy (PBT). Herein we review the published dosimetric and clinical PBT literature for esophageal cancer, including motion management considerations, the potential for reirradiation, radiation dose escalation, and ongoing esophageal PBT clinical trials. We also consider the potential cost-effectiveness of PBT relative to photon RT.

Consensus Statement on Proton Therapy in Early-Stage and Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2016-01-23,"Radiation dose escalation has been shown to improve local control and survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer in some studies, but randomized data have not supported this premise, possibly owing to adverse effects. Because of the physical characteristics of the Bragg peak, proton therapy (PT) delivers minimal exit dose distal to the target volume, resulting in better sparing of normal tissues in comparison to photon-based radiation therapy. This is particularly important for lung cancer given the proximity of the lung, heart, esophagus, major airways, large blood vessels, and spinal cord. However, PT is associated with more uncertainty because of the finite range of the proton beam and motion for thoracic cancers. PT is more costly than traditional photon therapy but may reduce side effects and toxicity-related hospitalization, which has its own associated cost. The cost of PT is decreasing over time because of reduced prices for the building, machine, maintenance, and overhead, as well as newer, shorter treatment programs. PT is improving rapidly as more research is performed particularly with the implementation of 4-dimensional computed tomography-based motion management and intensity modulated PT. Given these controversies, there is much debate in the oncology community about which patients with lung cancer benefit significantly from PT. The Particle Therapy Co-operative Group (PTCOG) Thoracic Subcommittee task group intends to address the issues of PT indications, advantages and limitations, cost-effectiveness, technology improvement, clinical trials, and future research directions. This consensus report can be used to guide clinical practice and indications for PT, insurance approval, and clinical or translational research directions.

Association of Distance Traveled for Surgery with Short- and Long-Term Cancer Outcomes.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2016-04-28,"The influence of distance traveled for treatment on short- and long-term cancer outcomes is unclear. Patients with colon, esophageal, liver, and pancreas cancer from 2003 to 2006 were identified from the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB). Distance traveled for surgical treatment was estimated using zip code centroids. Propensity scores were generated for probability of traveling farther for treatment. Mixed effects logistic regression for 90-day mortality and Cox regression for 5-year mortality were compared between patients treated regionally and those traveling from farther away. The mean distance traveled for all patients for surgical resection was 30.0 ± 227 miles, with a median distance of 7.5 (interquartile range 14.4) miles. Patients who were aged ≥80 years, on Medicaid, or African American were less likely to be in the fourth quartile of distance (Q4) traveled for surgery. Patients who were in Q4 had a lower risk-adjusted 90-day mortality compared to Q1 for colon [odds ratio (OR) 0.89, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.82-0.96], liver (OR 0.49, 95 % CI 0.3-0.78), and pancreatic (OR 0.74, 95 % CI 0.56-0.98) cancer.

Despite 7 publications noting potential intracranial neurotoxicity, the rates of radionecrosis and hemorrhage from whole brain RT (WBRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), or both do not appear increased with concurrent or sequential administration of BRAFis. Almost all grade 3 dermatitis reactions occurred when RT and BRAFi were administered concurrently. Painful, disfiguring nondermatitis cutaneous reactions have been described from concurrent or sequential RT and BRAFi administration, which improved with topical steroids and time. Visceral toxicity has been reported with RT and BRAFi, with deaths possibly related to bowel perforation and liver hemorrhage. Increased severity of radiation pneumonitis with BRAFi is rare, but more concerning was a potentially related fatal pulmonary hemorrhage. Conversely, encouraging reports have described patients with leptomeningeal spread and unresectable lymphadenopathy rendered disease free from combined RT and BRAFi. Based on our review, the authors recommend holding BRAFi and/or MEK inhibitors ≥3 days before and after fractionated RT and ≥1 day before and after SRS. No fatal reactions have been described with a dose <4 Gy per fraction, and time off systemic treatment should be minimized. Future prospective data will serve to refine these recommendations.",Journal Article,1329.0,38.0,BRAF kinase gene V600 point mutations drive approximately 40 to 50 of all melanomas and BRAF inhibitors BRAFi have been found to significantly improve survival outcomes Although radiation therapy RT provides effective symptom palliation there is a lack of toxicity and efficacy data when RT is combined with BRAFi including vemurafenib and dabrafenib This literature review provides a detailed analysis of potential increased dermatologic pulmonary neurologic hepatic and bowel toxicity from the combination of BRAFi and RT for patients described in 27 publications Despite 7 publications noting potential intracranial neurotoxicity the rates of radionecrosis and hemorrhage from whole brain RT WBRT stereotactic radiosurgery SRS or both do not appear increased with concurrent or sequential administration of BRAFis Almost all grade 3 dermatitis reactions occurred when RT and BRAFi were administered concurrently Painful disfiguring nondermatitis cutaneous reactions have been described from concurrent or sequential RT and BRAFi administration which improved with topical steroids and time Visceral toxicity has been reported with RT and BRAFi with deaths possibly related to bowel perforation and hemorrhage Increased severity of radiation pneumonitis with BRAFi is rare but more concerning was a potentially related fatal pulmonary hemorrhage Conversely encouraging reports have described patients with leptomeningeal spread and unresectable lymphadenopathy rendered disease free from combined RT and BRAFi Based on our review the authors recommend holding BRAFi and/or MEK inhibitors ≥3 days before and after fractionated RT and ≥1 day before and after SRS No fatal reactions have been described with a dose 4 Gy per fraction and time off systemic treatment should be minimized Future prospective data will serve to refine these recommendations,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[566, 216, 145, 4557, 741, 138, 3279, 705, 327, 6, 212, 1, 62, 1965, 2, 566, 222, 5961, 47, 85, 204, 6, 97, 401, 25, 123, 242, 121, 36, 240, 777, 323, 934, 3695, 125, 16, 8, 926, 1, 155, 2, 209, 74, 198, 240, 16, 397, 5, 5961, 141, 2728, 2, 3987, 26, 789, 206, 777, 8, 2455, 65, 1, 174, 101, 4722, 1087, 2543, 939, 2, 1659, 155, 29, 3, 150, 1, 5961, 2, 240, 9, 7, 1027, 4, 428, 4463, 550, 67, 4463, 21389, 174, 2089, 3561, 3, 151, 1, 12194, 2, 3599, 29, 902, 342, 240, 2034, 1729, 2192, 1429, 15, 110, 1022, 44, 1322, 101, 5, 750, 15, 1787, 634, 1, 68071, 2214, 62, 88, 27, 5236, 2428, 489, 198, 240, 2, 5961, 11, 468, 3294, 7041, 21020, 68072, 1486, 2428, 47, 85, 1027, 29, 750, 15, 1787, 240, 2, 5961, 634, 92, 231, 5, 5879, 4580, 2, 98, 2737, 155, 71, 85, 210, 5, 240, 2, 5961, 5, 1043, 2150, 139, 6, 1659, 4854, 2, 3599, 101, 1702, 1, 121, 2949, 5, 5961, 16, 622, 84, 80, 4243, 10, 8, 751, 139, 3034, 1087, 3599, 3154, 2269, 1198, 47, 1027, 7, 5, 4948, 2579, 2, 1468, 4962, 6021, 34, 115, 29, 397, 240, 2, 5961, 90, 23, 114, 206, 3, 738, 2237, 14904, 5961, 2, 15, 1693, 222, 2608, 162, 348, 2, 50, 3950, 240, 2, 3567, 218, 348, 2, 50, 1429, 77, 3034, 2428, 47, 85, 1027, 5, 8, 61, 39, 381, 379, 1509, 2, 98, 1889, 403, 24, 257, 40, 9243, 508, 482, 74, 303, 1833, 6, 5003, 46, 883]",1850.0,27131079,404
Treatment allocation in patients with early-stage esophageal adenocarcinoma: Prevalence and predictors of lymph node involvement.,Cancer,Cancer,2016-05-03,"In considering treatment allocation for patients with early esophageal adenocarcinoma, the incidence of lymph node metastasis is a critical determinant; however, this has not been well defined or stratified by the relevant clinical predictors of lymph node spread. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database of the National Cancer Institute were abstracted from 2004 to 2010 for patients with early-stage esophageal adenocarcinoma. The incidence of lymph node involvement for patients with Tis, T1a, and T1b tumors was examined and was stratified by predictors of spread. A total of 13,996 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma were evaluated. Excluding those with advanced, metastatic, and/or invasive (T2-T4) disease, 715 patients with Tis, T1a, and T1b tumors were included. On multivariate analysis, tumor grade (odds ratio [OR], 2.76; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.58-4.82 [P<.001]), T classification (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.24-0.91 [P =.025]), and tumor size (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.48-4.85 [P = .001]) were found to be independently associated with lymph node metastases. There was no lymph node spread noted with Tis tumors. For patients with low-grade (well or moderately differentiated) tumors measuring <2 cm in size, the risk of lymph node metastasis was 1.7% for T1a (P<.001) and 8.6% for T1b (P = .001) tumors. For patients with low-grade Tis or T1 tumors measuring ≤2 cm in size, the incidence of lymph node metastasis appears to be comparable to the mortality rate associated with esophagectomy. For highly selected patients with early esophageal adenocarcinomas, the results of the current study support the recommendation that local endoscopic resection can be considered as an alternative to surgical management when followed by rigorous endoscopic and radiographic surveillance.

Effect of body mass index on operative outcome after robotic-assisted Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy: retrospective analysis of 129 cases at a single high-volume tertiary care center.,Diseases of the esophagus : official journal of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus,Dis. Esophagus,2017-01-01,"The impact of body weight on outcomes after robotic-assisted esophageal surgery for cancer has not been studied. We examined the short-term operative outcomes in patients according to their body mass index following robotic-assisted Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy at a high-volume tertiary-care referral cancer center and evaluated the safety of robotic surgery in patients with an elevated body mass index. A retrospective review of all patients who underwent robotic-assisted Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy between April 2010 and June 2013 for pathologically confirmed distal esophageal cancer was conducted. Patient demographics, clinicopathologic data, and operative outcomes were collected. We stratified body mass index at admission for surgery according to World Health Organization criteria; normal range is defined as a body mass index range of 18.5-24.9 kg/m2. Overweight is defined as a body mass index range of 25.0-29.9 kg/m2 and obesity is defined as a body mass index of 30 kg/m2 and above. Statistics were calculated using Pearson's Chi-square and Pearson's correlation coefficient tests with a P-value of 0.05 or less for significance. One hundred and twenty-nine patients (103 men, 26 women) with median age of 67 (30-84) years were included. The majority of patients, 76% (N = 98) received neoadjuvant therapy. When stratified by body mass index, 28 (22%) were normal weight, 56 (43%) were overweight, and 45 (35%) were obese. All patients had R0 resection. Median operating room time was 407 (239-694) minutes. When stratified by body mass index, medians of operating room time across the normal weight, overweight and obese groups were 387 (254-660) minutes, 395 (310-645) minutes and 445 (239-694), respectively. Median estimated blood loss (EBL) was 150 (25-600) cc. When stratified by body mass index, medians of EBL across the normal weight, overweight and obese groups were 100 (50-500) cc, 150 (25-600) cc and 150 (25-600), respectively. Obesity significantly correlated with longer operating room time (P = 0.05) but without significant increased EBL (P = 0.348). Among the three body mass index groups there was no difference in postoperative complications including thrombotic events (pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis) (P = 0.266), pneumonia (P = 0.189), anastomotic leak (P = 0.090), wound infection (P = 0.390), any cardiac events (P = 0.793) or 30 days mortality (P = 0.414). Our data study demonstrates that patients with esophageal cancer and an elevated body mass index undergoing robotic-assisted Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy have increased operative times but no significantly increased EBL during the procedure.

This study retrospectively reviewed esophageal adenocarcinoma patients who received induction chemotherapy and chemoradiation before planned surgery; all had undergone a PET scan before and after induction chemotherapy. There were 201 patients, and 113 (56%) were PET responders (≥35% decrease in the maximum standardized uptake value of the tumor). All PET responders received the same chemotherapy during radiation, whereas 38 of the 88 PET nonresponders (43%) changed chemotherapy. Among the 152 patients who underwent surgery, the pathologic complete response rate was 15% for PET responders and 3% for PET nonresponders who did not change chemotherapy (P = .046). The median progression-free survival (PFS; 18.9 vs 10.0 months, P < 0.01) and OS (37 vs 25.3 months, P = .02) were significantly better for PET responders versus PET nonresponders who did not change chemotherapy. The median PFS for PET nonresponders who changed chemotherapy was 17.9 months, and it was superior to the median PFS for PET nonresponders who did not change chemotherapy (P = .01). For PET nonresponders, the 5-year OS rates were 37% for those who changed chemotherapy and 25% for those who did not change chemotherapy (P = .18). A PET scan after induction chemotherapy predicts outcomes for locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma patients who undergo chemoradiation and surgery. The median PFS is improved, and trends toward improved OS appear possible in PET nonresponders who change chemotherapy during radiation. The fully accrued Cancer and Leukemia Group B 80803 study (NCT01333033) is evaluating this strategy.

Association of Physical Activity by Type and Intensity With Digestive System Cancer Risk.,JAMA oncology,JAMA Oncol,2016-09-01,"Accumulating evidence indicates that common carcinogenic pathways may underlie digestive system cancers. Physical activity may influence these pathways. Yet, to our knowledge, no previous study has evaluated the role of physical activity in overall digestive system cancer risk. To examine the association between physical activity and digestive system cancer risk, accounting for amount, type (aerobic vs resistance), and intensity of physical activity. A prospective cohort study followed 43 479 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study from 1986 to 2012. At enrollment, the eligible participants were 40 years or older, were free of cancer, and reported physical activity. Follow-up rates exceeded 90% in each 2-year cycle. The amount of total physical activity expressed in metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-hours/week. Incident cancer of the digestive system encompassing the digestive tract (mouth, throat, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and colorectum) and digestive accessory organs (pancreas, gallbladder, and liver). Over 686 924 person-years, we documented 1370 incident digestive system cancers. Higher levels of physical activity were associated with lower digestive system cancer risk (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74 for ≥63.0 vs ≤8.9 MET-hours/week; 95% CI, 0.59-0.93; P value for trend = .003). The inverse association was more evident with digestive tract cancers (HR, 0.66 for ≥63.0 vs ≤8.9 MET-hours/week; 95% CI, 0.51-0.87) than with digestive accessary organ cancers. Aerobic exercise was particularly beneficial against digestive system cancers, with the optimal benefit observed at approximately 30 MET-hours/week (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.56-0.83; P value for nonlinearity = .02). Moreover, as long as the same level of MET-hour score was achieved from aerobic exercise, the magnitude of risk reduction was similar regardless of intensity of aerobic exercise. Physical activity, as indicated by MET-hours/week, was inversely associated with the risk of digestive system cancers, particularly digestive tract cancers, in men. The optimal benefit was observed through aerobic exercise of any intensity at the equivalent of energy expenditure of approximately 10 hours/week of walking at average pace.

Central nervous system relapse in patients with untreated HER2-positive esophageal or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2016-06-10,"Although HER2-positive breast cancers demonstrate a propensity for central nervous system (CNS) metastasis, it is unknown whether other HER2-positive tumors, including adenocarcinomas of the esophagus/gastroesophageal junction (EAC), share this characteristic. Insight into this association may inform the development of HER2-targeted therapies that penetrate the blood-brain barrier. We examined HER2 overexpression and gene amplification in 708 patients with EAC who underwent curative-intent surgery during a time period (1980-1997) when no patient received HER2-targeted therapy. We identified patients whose site of first cancer recurrence was CNS and those who had a CNS relapse at any time. After a median follow-up of 61.2 months, 3.4% (24/708) of patients developed CNS relapse (all involved the brain). Patients with HER2-positive (vs -negative) primary tumors showed a higher 5-year cumulative incidence of CNS relapse as first recurrence (5.8% vs. 1.2%; p = 0.0058) and at any time (8.3% vs. 2.4%; p = 0.0062). In a multivariable model that included covariates previously associated with HER2 or with CNS relapse in breast cancer, HER2 positivity was the only variable that was statistically significantly associated with shorter time to CNS relapse as first recurrence (p = 0.0026) or at any time (hazard ratio 4.3 [95% confidence interval 1.8 to 10.3]; p = 0.001).

Persistence of dysphagia and odynophagia after mediastinal radiation and chemotherapy in patients with lung cancer or lymphoma.,Diseases of the esophagus : official journal of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus,Dis. Esophagus,2017-02-01,"Esophageal symptoms are common during radiation and chemotherapy. It is unclear how often these symptoms persist after therapy. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 320 adults treated for nonmetastatic breast cancer (84), lung cancer (109), or Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (127) who were disease-free at 10-14 months after therapy. Treatment included chemotherapy with or without nonmediastinal radiation therapy (150 patients), chemotherapy plus sequential mediastinal radiation therapy (MRT) (48 patients), chemotherapy plus concurrent MRT (61 patients), or non-MRT only (61 patients). Proton pump inhibitor use was documented. All treatment groups had similar prevalence of the esophageal symptom of heartburn before therapy. Rates were higher during treatment in those who received MRT with or without chemotherapy, but declined by 10-14 months after treatment. However, low baseline rates of dysphagia (4%) and odynophagia (2%) increased significantly after combined chemotherapy and MRT to 72% for dysphagia and 62% for odynophagia (P < 0.01) during treatment and stayed significantly elevated over baseline with 27% of the patients having dysphagia and 11% having odynophagia at 10-14 months after treatment.

Pathologic Complete Response Is an Independent Predictor of Improved Survival Following Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation for Esophageal Adenocarcinoma.,Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,J. Gastrointest. Surg.,2016-06-03,"Reports of improved survival in patients with pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant therapy for esophageal and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma is extrapolated from heterogeneous studies that include squamous cell histology. We sought to determine if pCR is associated with a survival advantage in a homogenous group of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma. This is a single institution analysis of all patients with T2-T4 or node positive esophageal adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and esophagectomy between 2004 and 2014. Patients were divided into two groups based on pathological response, pCR vs. incomplete pathological response (iPR). Survival outcomes were evaluated using standard Kaplan-Meier methods and multivariable Cox regression models. A total of 205 patients were included in the study: 38 (19 %) patients with pCR and 167 patients (81 %) with iPR. The two groups were similar with respect to clinical stage, age, gender, comorbid conditions, ECOG status, smoking, and alcohol use. Patients in the pCR group had a higher percentage of tumors located in middle third of esophagus (11 vs. 2 %, p = 0.04) while tumor grade was similar in both groups. Median follow-up was 50 months, range 2-109 months. The 3-year overall (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) for iPR was 48 and 39 %, respectively, vs. 86 and 80 % for pCR group, respectively. This analysis of a cohort of homogeneous patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma undergoing multimodality therapy showed that pCR is an independent predictor of improved RFS and OS.

Radiation dermatitis caused by a bolus effect from an abdominal compression device.,Medical dosimetry : official journal of the American Association of Medical Dosimetrists,Med Dosim,2016-06-02,"American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group 176 evaluated the dosimetric effects caused by couch tops and immobilization devices. The report analyzed the extensive physics-based literature on couch tops, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) frames, and body immobilization bags, while noting the scarcity of clinical reports of skin toxicity because of external devices. Here, we present a clinical case report of grade 1 abdominal skin toxicity owing to an abdominal compression device. We discuss the dosimetric implications of the utilized treatment plan as well as post hoc alternative plans and quantify differences in attenuation and skin dose/build-up between the device, a lower-density alternative device, and an open field. The description of the case includes a 66-year-old male with HER2 amplified poorly differentiated distal esophageal adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant chemo-radiation and the use of an abdominal compression device. Radiation was delivered using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with 2 arcs using abdominal compression and image guidance. The total dose was 50.4Gy delivered over 40 elapsed days. With 2 fractions remaining, the patient developed dermatitis in the area of the compression device. The original treatment plan did not include a contour of the device. Alternative post hoc treatment plans were generated, one to contour the device and a second with anterior avoidance. In conclusion, replanning with the device contoured revealed the bolus effect. The skin dose increased from 27 to 36Gy. planned target volume (PTV) coverage at 45Gy was reduced to 76.5% from 95.8%. The second VMAT treatment plan with an anterior avoidance sector and more oblique beam angles maintained PTV coverage and spared the anterior wall, however at the expense of substantially increased dose to lung. This case report provides an important reminder of the bolus effect from external devices such as abdominal compression. Special consideration must be given to contour and/or avoiding beam entrance to the device, and to the use of such devices in patients who may have heightened radiosensitivity, such as those who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive.

The Multidisciplinary Approach to GI Cancer Results in Change of Diagnosis and Management of Patients. Multidisciplinary Care Impacts Diagnosis and Management of Patients.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2016-06-24,"The multidisciplinary approach to GI cancer is becoming more widespread as a result of multimodality therapy. At the University of Colorado Hospital (UCH), we utilize a formal multidisciplinary approach through specialized clinics across a variety of settings, including pancreas and biliary cancer, esophageal and gastric cancer, liver cancer and neuroendocrine tumors (NET), and colorectal cancer. Patients with these suspected diagnoses are seen in a multidisciplinary clinic. We evaluated whether implementation of disease-specific multidisciplinary programs resulted in a change in diagnosis and/or change in management for these patients. Data from 1747 patients were prospectively collected from inception of each multidisciplinary program through December 31, 2015. Change in diagnosis was defined as a change in radiographic or endoscopic findings that resulted in a change in cancer stage or clinical diagnosis and/or a change in pathologic diagnosis. Reports of incidental findings unrelated to primary diagnosis on radiographic evaluation were also assessed, but not included in overall change in diagnosis findings. We further evaluated if patients had a change in the management of their disease compared with outside recommendations.

CALGB 80403 (Alliance)/E1206: A Randomized Phase II Study of Three Chemotherapy Regimens Plus Cetuximab in Metastatic Esophageal and Gastroesophageal Junction Cancers.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-07-05,"To determine the optimal chemotherapy backbone for testing in future US cooperative group studies for metastatic esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancers. Cetuximab was added to each treatment arm based on promising preclinical data. Patients with previously untreated metastatic esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer were randomly assigned at a one-to-one-to-one ratio to epirubicin, cisplatin, and continuous-infusion fluorouracil (ECF), irinotecan plus cisplatin (IC), or FOLFOX (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and bolus and infusional fluorouracil). All treatment programs included cetuximab once per week. The primary end point was response rate. Secondary outcomes included overall survival, progression-free survival, time to treatment failure, and safety. As prespecified, primary and secondary analyses were conducted only among patients with adenocarcinoma. This study randomly assigned 245 patients, including 222 with adenocarcinoma. Among patients with adenocarcinoma, response rate was 60.9% (95% CI, 47.9 to 72.8) for ECF plus cetuximab, 45.0% (95% CI, 33.0 to 57.0) for IC plus cetuximab, and 54.3% (95% CI, 42.0 to 66.2) for FOLFOX plus cetuximab. Median overall survival was 11.6, 8.6, and 11.8 months; median progression-free survival was 7.1, 4.9, and 6.8 months; and median time to treatment failure was 5.6, 4.3, and 6.7 months for each of these arms, respectively. FOLFOX plus cetuximab required fewer treatment modifications compared with ECF plus cetuximab and IC plus cetuximab (P = .013), and fewer patients were removed from treatment because of an adverse event or experienced treatment-related death. In combination with cetuximab, ECF and FOLFOX had similar efficacy, but FOLFOX was better tolerated. Although differences were nonsignificant, IC plus cetuximab seemed to be the least effective and most toxic of the three regimens tested.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",1295.0,37.0,To determine the optimal chemotherapy backbone for testing in future US cooperative group studies for metastatic and gastroesophageal junction cancers Cetuximab was added to each treatment arm based on promising preclinical data Patients with previously untreated metastatic or gastroesophageal junction cancer were randomly assigned at a one-to-one-to-one ratio to epirubicin cisplatin and continuous-infusion fluorouracil ECF irinotecan plus cisplatin IC or FOLFOX oxaliplatin leucovorin and bolus and infusional fluorouracil All treatment programs included cetuximab once per week The primary end point was response rate Secondary outcomes included overall survival progression-free survival time to treatment failure and safety As prespecified primary and secondary analyses were conducted only among patients with adenocarcinoma This study randomly assigned 245 patients including 222 with adenocarcinoma Among patients with adenocarcinoma response rate was 60.9 95 CI 47.9 to 72.8 for ECF plus cetuximab 45.0 95 CI 33.0 to 57.0 for IC plus cetuximab and 54.3 95 CI 42.0 to 66.2 for FOLFOX plus cetuximab Median overall survival was 11.6 8.6 and 11.8 months median progression-free survival was 7.1 4.9 and 6.8 months and median time to treatment failure was 5.6 4.3 and 6.7 months for each of these arms respectively FOLFOX plus cetuximab required fewer treatment modifications compared with ECF plus cetuximab and IC plus cetuximab P .013 and fewer patients were removed from treatment because of an adverse event or experienced treatment-related death In combination with cetuximab ECF and FOLFOX had similar efficacy but FOLFOX was better tolerated Although differences were nonsignificant IC plus cetuximab seemed to be the least effective and most toxic of the three regimens tested,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[6, 223, 3, 665, 56, 7066, 9, 471, 4, 508, 843, 1690, 87, 94, 9, 113, 2, 3227, 3322, 163, 1175, 10, 1953, 6, 296, 24, 475, 90, 23, 721, 693, 74, 7, 5, 373, 1278, 113, 15, 3227, 3322, 12, 11, 1108, 896, 28, 8, 104, 6, 104, 6, 104, 197, 6, 5363, 540, 2, 1314, 904, 1404, 11830, 1071, 349, 540, 2340, 15, 3777, 1476, 3296, 2, 3604, 2, 4825, 1404, 62, 24, 2251, 159, 1175, 1059, 379, 647, 3, 86, 396, 741, 10, 51, 116, 568, 123, 159, 63, 25, 91, 115, 25, 98, 6, 24, 496, 2, 367, 22, 4075, 86, 2, 568, 318, 11, 426, 158, 107, 7, 5, 449, 26, 45, 1108, 896, 7373, 7, 141, 5647, 5, 449, 107, 7, 5, 449, 51, 116, 10, 335, 83, 48, 58, 662, 83, 6, 720, 66, 9, 11830, 349, 1175, 512, 13, 48, 58, 466, 13, 6, 696, 13, 9, 2340, 349, 1175, 2, 667, 27, 48, 58, 595, 13, 6, 700, 18, 9, 3777, 349, 1175, 52, 63, 25, 10, 175, 49, 66, 49, 2, 175, 66, 53, 52, 91, 115, 25, 10, 67, 14, 39, 83, 2, 49, 66, 53, 2, 52, 98, 6, 24, 496, 10, 33, 49, 39, 27, 2, 49, 67, 53, 9, 296, 1, 46, 1335, 106, 3777, 349, 1175, 616, 1497, 24, 2916, 72, 5, 11830, 349, 1175, 2, 2340, 349, 1175, 19, 3612, 2, 1497, 7, 11, 2264, 29, 24, 408, 1, 35, 290, 774, 15, 592, 24, 139, 273, 4, 150, 5, 1175, 11830, 2, 3777, 42, 288, 209, 84, 3777, 10, 380, 421, 242, 362, 11, 5542, 2340, 349, 1175, 5025, 6, 40, 3, 506, 323, 2, 96, 1812, 1, 3, 169, 472, 650]",1793.0,27382098,276
"Neoadjuvant irinotecan, cisplatin, and concurrent radiation therapy with celecoxib for patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer.",BMC cancer,BMC Cancer,2016-07-13,"Patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who are treated with trimodality therapy have a high recurrence rate. Preclinical evidence suggests that inhibition of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) increases the effectiveness of chemoradiation, and observational studies in humans suggest that COX-2 inhibition may reduce esophageal cancer risk. This trial tested the safety and efficacy of combining a COX2 inhibitor, celecoxib, with neoadjuvant irinotecan/cisplatin chemoradiation. This single arm phase 2 trial combined irinotecan, cisplatin, and celecoxib with concurrent radiation therapy. Patients with stage IIA-IVA esophageal cancer received weekly cisplatin 30 mg/m(2) plus irinotecan 65 mg/m(2) on weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5 concurrently with 5040 cGy of radiation therapy. Celecoxib 400 mg was taken orally twice daily during chemoradiation, up to 1 week before surgery, and for 6 months following surgery. Forty patients were enrolled with stage IIa (30 %), stage IIb (20 %), stage III (22.5 %), and stage IVA (27.5 %) esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer (AJCC, 5th Edition). During chemoradiation, grade 3-4 treatment-related toxicity included dysphagia (20 %), anorexia (17.5 %), dehydration (17.5 %), nausea (15 %), neutropenia (12.5 %), diarrhea (10 %), fatigue (7.5 %), and febrile neutropenia (7.5 %). The pathological complete response rate was 32.5 %. The median progression free survival was 15.7 months and the median overall survival was 34.7 months. 15 % (n = 6) of patients treated on this study developed brain metastases. The addition of celecoxib to neoadjuvant cisplatin-irinotecan chemoradiation was tolerable; however, overall survival appeared comparable to prior studies using neoadjuvant cisplatin-irinotecan chemoradiation alone. Further studies adding celecoxib to neoadjuvant chemoradiation in esophageal cancer are not warranted.

Comparison of cisplatinum/paclitaxel with cisplatinum/5-fluorouracil as first-line therapy for nonsurgical locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients.,"Drug design, development and therapy",Drug Des Devel Ther,2016-07-01,"To retrospectively evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (dCRT) with cisplatinum/paclitaxel versus cisplatinum/5-fluorouracil in patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who received nonsurgical treatment. This study retrospectively evaluated 202 patients with locally advanced ESCC treated at Shandong Cancer Hospital between January 2009 and December 2013. All the patients initially received dCRT, including platinum and paclitaxel or 5-fluorouracil, with concurrent 1.8 or 2 Gy/fraction radiation (total dose, 54-60 Gy). The patient population was divided into two treatment groups: 105 patients who received the cisplatinum/paclitaxel regimen were allocated to group A, and 97 patients who received the cisplatinum/5-fluorouracil regimen were allocated to group B. We compared the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) by various clinical variables, including prior treatment characteristics, major toxicities (mainly in grade 3 and 4 hematological), and response to dCRT. We used the receiver operating curve analysis to determine the optimal cutoff value of clinical stage and radiation dose. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival comparison and Cox regression for multivariate analysis. Median PFS and OS in group A were significantly better compared with group B (median PFS, 15.9 versus 13.0 months, P=0.016 and median OS, 33.9 versus 23.1 months, P=0.014, respectively). The 1- and 2-year survival rates of the two groups were 82.9% versus 76.3%, and 61.9% versus 47.6%, respectively. The complete response and response rate were 17.1% versus 7.2% (P=0.032) and 52.4% versus 30.9% (P=0.042) in group A and B, respectively. Meanwhile, group B was associated with a significantly lower rate of grade 3/4 overall toxicity than group A (P=0.039).

What's the Best Way to Treat GE Junction Tumors? Approach Like Gastric Cancer.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2016-07-26,"The debate as to the optimal classification, staging, and treatment of gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) tumors wages on, and one must acknowledge that there is no ""one-size-fits-all"" approach. However, in this review we are charged with defending the position that all GEJ tumors are best treated like gastric cancer. We submit that, as stated, this is not a defensible position and that a clear definition of terms is warranted. Given the rarity of squamous cell carcinoma and the dramatic rise in incidence of adenocarcinoma of the GEJ in the West, we define GEJ ""tumors"" to mean adenocarcinomas of the GEJ. Furthermore, on the basis of their location, pathogenesis, and biologic behavior, we submit that few would argue with the contention that Siewert type I GEJ tumors are best treated like distal esophageal cancer and that Siewert type III GEJ tumors are best treated like gastric cancer. The real debate concerns the management of Siewert type II GEJ tumors, which arise immediately at the esophagogastric junction. Thus, for the purposes of this review, we have taken the liberty of redefining the question as what's the best way to treat adenocarcinomas of the true GEJ (i.e., Siewert type II tumors), and we submit that these tumors are in fact best treated like gastric cancer.

Transhiatal Esophagectomy for Esophageal Cancer.,Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Surgical resection still remains the mainstay in the treatment of localized esophageal adenocarcinoma. Multiple techniques have been described for esophagectomy, which are based on either a transthoracic or transhiatal approach. Despite proponents of each technique touting potential advantages such as superior oncologic resection with more extensive transthoracic lymphadenectomy compared to the relatively limited morbidity and mortality with a transhiatal resection, the superiority of one technique over another is not clear and may be relegated to a topic of historical significance in the era of minimally invasive surgery. With the increased acceptance of neoadjuvant multimodality therapy, both approaches have been shown to have acceptable outcomes.

HER3 Expression Is a Marker of Tumor Progression in Premalignant Lesions of the Gastroesophageal Junction.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2016-08-25,"Overexpression of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), including members of the HER family, has prognostic and therapeutic significance in invasive esophagogastric carcinoma. RTK expression in premalignant gastroesophageal lesions has not been extensively explored. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples of esophageal biopsy specimens from 73 patients with Barrett's esophagus with either low-grade dysplasia (LGD) (n = 32) or high-grade dysplasia (HGD) (n = 59) were analyzed for HER1, HER2, HER3 and CMET expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Immunophenotype was correlated with histologic and clinical features. High-grade dysplasia (HGD) was associated with overexpression of HER1 (20.7% vs. 3.1%, p = 0.023), HER2 (5.3% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.187) and HER3 (47.4% vs. 9.4%, p<0.001) compared to low-grade dysplasia (LGD). There was a significant association of HER2 (20.0% vs. 2.1%, p = 0.022) and HER3 (80.0% vs. 40.4%, p = 0.023) overexpression in HGD lesions associated with foci of invasive carcinoma compared to those without invasive foci. Overexpression of CMET was observed in 42.9% of specimens, was increasingly observed with HGD compared to LGD (58.3% vs. 36.7%, p = 0.200), and was most often co-expressed with HER3 (62.5% of HER3-positive specimens vs. 38.2% of HER3-negative specimens, p = 0.212). In summary, HER3 is frequently overexpressed in high-grade dysplastic lesions of the gastroesophageal junction and may be a marker of invasive progression.

Utility of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET for Predicting Histopathologic Response in Esophageal Carcinoma following Chemoradiation.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2016-08-26,"For patients with esophageal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT) followed by surgical resection, complete histopathologic response (pCR) is associated with favorable overall survival (OS). The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) response to neoadjuvant CRT and pCR. Maximum standardized uptake values and standardized uptake ratios (SURs) were measured before and after CRT. SUR was normalized to liver uptake and mediastinal blood pool uptake. FDG PET complete response was defined as metabolic activity normalization to hepatic and blood pool activity. The correlation between FDG PET parameters and pCR was examined through logistic regression analyses. In total, 193 patients were monitored for a median of 3.6 years after initiation of CRT. Most tumors were adenocarcinoma (85%) and stage T3 (75%). Complete FDG PET response and pCR occurred in 27% and 34% of patients, respectively. Histologic findings, chemotherapy type, tumor stage, and radiation dose were not significantly associated with complete radiographic response. The rates of pCR in patients with and without radiographic complete response were 42% and 31% (p = 0.17), respectively. No predictive correlation was found between pCR and change in maximum standardized uptake value (p = 0.25), in SUR normalized to blood pool uptake (p = 0.20), or in SUR normalized to liver uptake (p = 0.15).

No Survival Difference with Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Compared with Chemotherapy in Resectable Esophageal and Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma: Results from the National Cancer Data Base.,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,J. Am. Coll. Surg.,2016-09-15,"Neoadjuvant treatment improves survival in resectable esophageal adenocarcinoma, but the optimal regimen has not been defined. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT) is associated with higher pathologic complete response (pCR) relative to chemotherapy (nCTX), but has not been shown to improve survival; however, previous studies have been underpowered to demonstrate a survival difference. The objective of this study was to determine if nCRT is associated with increased survival relative to nCTX in patients with resectable esophageal adenocarcinoma. The National Cancer Data Base (2006 to 2013) was retrospectively reviewed for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma who underwent neoadjuvant treatment followed by resection. Data were collected regarding patient, disease, and treatment variables. Outcomes included 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS), pCR rate, and short-term postoperative outcomes. Propensity-adjusted analysis was conducted to account for baseline differences between treatment groups. Six hundred fifty patients received nCTX and 6,336 received nCRT. Patients who underwent nCTX had slightly smaller tumors, and fewer were clinical stage III at baseline. Pathologic complete response was 17.2% with nCTX and 31.6% with nCRT (p < 0.001). Receiving nCRT was associated with fewer nodes examined, fewer nodes involved, fewer T3/4 tumors, and fewer positive margins than nCTX. There was no significant difference in OS between the 2 groups (hazard ratio [HR] 1.08 nCRT vs nCTX, 95% CI 0.95, 1.21, p = 0.228). There was no significant difference in short-term postoperative outcomes by treatment modality. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation is not associated with improved survival relative to nCTX for resectable esophageal adenocarcinoma.

"RAB23, regulated by miR-92b, promotes the progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.",Gene,Gene,2016-09-19,"RAB23, a member of Ras-related small GTPase family, has been reported to be up-regulated in several cancer types. However, its biological functions and the underlying molecular mechanisms for its oncogenic roles in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain unknown. In this study, we have shown that the expression of RAB23 was elevated in ESCC tissues and ESCC cells. Overexpression of RAB23 promoted the growth and migration of the ESCC cells, while knocking down the expression RAB23 inhibited the growth, migration and metastasis of the ESCC cells. The molecular mechanism study showed that RAB23 activated beta-catenin/TCF signaling and regulated the expression of several target genes. In the further study, it was found that the expression of RAB23 was regulated by the miR-92b. Forced expression of MiR-92b decreased the mRNA and protein level of RAB23, and RAB23 rescued the biological functions of miR-92b.

Attaining Proficiency in Robotic-Assisted Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy While Maximizing Safety During Procedure Development.,"Innovations (Philadelphia, Pa.)",Innovations (Phila),,"Robotic-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) is an emerging complex operation with limited reports detailing morbidity, mortality, and requirements for attaining proficiency. Our objective was to develop a standardized RAMIE technique, evaluate procedure safety, and assess outcomes using a dedicated operative team and 2-surgeon approach. We conducted a study of sequential patients undergoing RAMIE from January 25, 2011, to May 5, 2014. Intermedian demographics and perioperative data were compared between sequential halves of the experience using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and the Fischer exact test. Median operative time was tracked over successive 15-patient cohorts. One hundred of 313 esophageal resections performed at our institution underwent RAMIE during the study period. A dedicated team including 2 attending surgeons and uniform anesthesia and OR staff was established. There were no significant differences in age, sex, histology, stage, induction therapy, or risk class between the 2 halves of the study. Estimated blood loss, conversions, operative times, and overall complications significantly decreased. The median resected lymph nodes increased but was not statistically significant. Median operative time decreased to approximately 370 minutes between the 30th and the 45th cases. There were no emergent intraoperative complications, and the anastomotic leak rate was 6% (6/100).

Stereotactic laser ablation as treatment for brain metastases that recur after stereotactic radiosurgery: a multiinstitutional experience.,Neurosurgical focus,Neurosurg Focus,2016-10-01,"OBJECTIVE Therapeutic options for brain metastases (BMs) that recur after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) remain limited. METHODS The authors provide the collective experience of 4 institutions where treatment of BMs that recurred after SRS was performed with stereotactic laser ablation (SLA). RESULTS Twenty-six BMs (in 23 patients) that recurred after SRS were treated with SLA (2 patients each underwent 2 SLAs for separate lesions, and a third underwent 2 serial SLAs for discrete BMs). Histological findings in the BMs treated included the following: breast (n = 6); lung (n = 6); melanoma (n = 5); colon (n = 2); ovarian (n = 1); bladder (n = 1); esophageal (n = 1); and sarcoma (n = 1). With a median follow-up duration of 141 days (range 64-794 days), 9 of the SLA-treated BMs progressed despite treatment (35%). All cases of progression occurred in BMs in which < 80% ablation was achieved, whereas no disease progression was observed in BMs in which ≥ 80% ablation was achieved. Five BMs were treated with SLA, followed 1 month later by adjuvant SRS (5 Gy daily × 5 days). No disease progression was observed in these patients despite ablation efficiency of < 80%, suggesting that adjuvant hypofractionated SRS enhances the efficacy of SLA. Of the 23 SLA-treated patients, 3 suffered transient hemiparesis (13%), 1 developed hydrocephalus requiring temporary ventricular drainage (4%), and 1 patient who underwent SLA of a 28.9-cm<sup>3</sup> lesion suffered a neurological deficit requiring an emergency hemicraniectomy (4%). Although there is significant heterogeneity in corticosteroid treatment post-SLA, most patients underwent a 2-week taper. CONCLUSIONS Stereotactic laser ablation is an effective treatment option for BMs in which SRS fails. Ablation of ≥ 80% of BMs is associated with decreased risk of disease progression.

Final Results of NRG Oncology RTOG 0246: An Organ-Preserving Selective Resection Strategy in Esophageal Cancer Patients Treated with Definitive Chemoradiation.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2016-10-08,"The impact of selective surgical resection for patients with esophageal cancer treated with definitive chemoradiation has not been clearly evaluated long-term. NRG (National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, Radiation Therapy Oncology Group, Gynecologic Oncology Group) Oncology Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0246 was a multi-institutional, single-arm, open-label, nonrandomized phase II study that enrolled 43 patients from September 2003 to March 2008 with clinical stage T1-4N0-1M0 squamous cell or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction from 19 sites. Patients received induction chemotherapy with fluorouracil (650 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/d), cisplatin (15 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/d), and paclitaxel (200 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/d) for two cycles followed by concurrent chemoradiation consisting of 50.4 Gy of radiation (1.8 Gy per fraction) and daily fluorouracil (300 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/d) with cisplatin (15 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/d) over the first 5 days. After definitive chemoradiation, patients were evaluated for residual disease. Selective esophagectomy was considered only for patients with residual disease after chemoradiation (clinical incomplete response) or recurrent disease on surveillance. This report looks at the long-term outcome of this selective surgical strategy. With a median follow-up of 8.1 years (minimum to maximum for 12 alive patients 7.2-9.8 years), the estimated 5- and 7-year survival rates are 36.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 22.3-51.0) and 31.7% (95% CI: 18.3-46.0). Clinical complete response was achieved in 15 patients (37%), with 5- and 7-yearr survival rates of 53.3% (95% CI: 26.3-74.4) and 46.7% (95% CI: 21.2-68.7). Esophageal resection was not required in 20 of 41 patients (49%) on this trial. The long-term results of NRG Oncology Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0246 demonstrate promising efficacy of a selective surgical resection strategy and suggest the need for larger randomized studies to further evaluate this organ-preserving approach.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",1200.0,22.0,The impact of selective surgical resection for patients with cancer treated with definitive chemoradiation has not been clearly evaluated long-term NRG National Surgical Adjuvant and Bowel Project Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Gynecologic Oncology Group Oncology Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0246 was a multi-institutional single-arm open-label nonrandomized phase II study that enrolled 43 patients from September 2003 to March 2008 with clinical stage T1-4N0-1M0 squamous cell or adenocarcinoma of the or gastroesophageal junction from 19 sites Patients received induction chemotherapy with fluorouracil 650 mg/m sup 2 /sup /d cisplatin 15 mg/m sup 2 /sup /d and paclitaxel 200 mg/m sup 2 /sup /d for two cycles followed by concurrent chemoradiation consisting of 50.4 Gy of radiation 1.8 Gy per fraction and daily fluorouracil 300 mg/m sup 2 /sup /d with cisplatin 15 mg/m sup 2 /sup /d over the first 5 days After definitive chemoradiation patients were evaluated for residual disease Selective esophagectomy was considered only for patients with residual disease after chemoradiation clinical incomplete response or recurrent disease on surveillance This report looks at the long-term outcome of this selective surgical strategy With a median follow-up of 8.1 years minimum to maximum for 12 alive patients 7.2-9.8 years the estimated 5- and 7-year survival rates are 36.6 95 confidence interval CI 22.3-51.0 and 31.7 95 CI 18.3-46.0 Clinical complete response was achieved in 15 patients 37 with 5- and 7-yearr survival rates of 53.3 95 CI 26.3-74.4 and 46.7 95 CI 21.2-68.7 resection was not required in 20 of 41 patients 49 on this trial The long-term results of NRG Oncology Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0246 demonstrate promising efficacy of a selective surgical resection strategy and suggest the need for larger randomized studies to further evaluate this organ-preserving approach,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[3, 345, 1, 1094, 221, 170, 9, 7, 5, 12, 73, 5, 1057, 975, 71, 44, 85, 2536, 194, 319, 337, 8828, 657, 221, 249, 2, 1659, 3105, 121, 36, 413, 87, 1512, 413, 87, 413, 121, 36, 413, 87, 39623, 10, 8, 1414, 1115, 226, 475, 1020, 1756, 5666, 124, 215, 45, 17, 346, 601, 7, 29, 2636, 1522, 6, 2363, 1375, 5, 38, 82, 1534, 18534, 28003, 691, 31, 15, 449, 1, 3, 15, 3227, 3322, 29, 326, 633, 7, 103, 504, 56, 5, 1404, 8642, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 427, 540, 167, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 427, 2, 490, 1250, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 427, 9, 100, 410, 370, 20, 750, 975, 2273, 1, 212, 39, 381, 1, 121, 14, 66, 381, 379, 1509, 2, 391, 1404, 2036, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 427, 5, 540, 167, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 427, 252, 3, 157, 33, 162, 50, 1057, 975, 7, 11, 194, 9, 753, 34, 1094, 3617, 10, 515, 158, 9, 7, 5, 753, 34, 50, 975, 38, 2610, 51, 15, 387, 34, 23, 617, 26, 414, 18362, 28, 3, 319, 337, 228, 1, 26, 1094, 221, 692, 5, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 66, 14, 60, 2499, 6, 689, 9, 133, 1701, 7, 67, 18, 83, 66, 60, 3, 661, 33, 2, 67, 111, 25, 151, 32, 511, 49, 48, 307, 268, 58, 350, 27, 725, 13, 2, 456, 67, 48, 58, 203, 27, 641, 13, 38, 236, 51, 10, 513, 4, 167, 7, 567, 5, 33, 2, 67, 69139, 25, 151, 1, 699, 27, 48, 58, 432, 27, 794, 39, 2, 641, 67, 48, 58, 239, 18, 806, 67, 170, 10, 44, 616, 4, 179, 1, 605, 7, 739, 23, 26, 160, 3, 319, 337, 99, 1, 8828, 413, 121, 36, 413, 87, 39623, 608, 721, 209, 1, 8, 1094, 221, 170, 692, 2, 309, 3, 594, 9, 1077, 384, 94, 6, 195, 376, 26, 1259, 4972, 353]",1904.0,27729298,393
Persistent Dysphagia After Induction Chemotherapy in Patients with Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Predicts Poor Post-Operative Outcomes.,Journal of gastrointestinal cancer,J Gastrointest Cancer,2017-06-01,"Preoperative therapy is frequently employed in the management of esophageal adenocarcinoma. However, many patients are found to have advanced pathologic stage and have poor outcomes. A prognostic factor which identifies this patient population before surgery would be desirable, as alternative treatment strategies may be warranted. Between 2/08 and 1/12, 60 evaluable patients with locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma enrolled in single-arm phase II trial of induction chemotherapy, surgery, and post-operative adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy (CRT). A clinical stage of T3, N1, or M1a (AJCC 6th) was required for eligibility. Induction chemotherapy with epirubicin 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> d1, oxaliplatin 130 mg/m<sup>2</sup> d1, and fluorouracil 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day continuous infusion for 3 weeks, was given every 21 days for 3 cycles and was followed by surgical resection. Adjuvant CRT consisted of 50-55 Gy @ 1.8-2.0 Gy/day and 2 cycles of cisplatin (20 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day) and fluorouracil (1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day) given as 96-h infusions during weeks 1 and 4 of radiotherapy. Dysphagia was assessed at baseline and after induction chemotherapy. Persistent dysphagia was associated with worse distant metastatic control [HR 3.48 (1.43-8.43), p = 0.006], recurrence free survival [HR 3.04 (1.34-6.92), p = 0.008], and overall survival [HR 3.31 (1.43-7.66), p = 0.005].

5-Fluorouracil upregulates cell surface B7-H1 (PD-L1) expression in gastrointestinal cancers.,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,J Immunother Cancer,2016-10-18,"Resistance to chemotherapy is a major obstacle in the effective treatment of cancer patients. B7-homolog 1, also known as programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), is an immunoregulatory protein that is overexpressed in several human cancers. Interaction of B7-H1 with programmed death 1 (PD-1) prevents T-cell activation and proliferation, sequestering the T-cell receptor from the cell membrane, inducing T-cell apoptosis, thereby leading to cancer immunoresistance. B7-H1 upregulation contributes to chemoresistance in several types of cancer, but little is known with respect to changes associated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or gastrointestinal cancers. HCT 116 p53<sup>+/+</sup>, HCT 116 p53<sup>-/-</sup> colorectal cancer (CRC) and OE33 esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) cells were treated with increasing doses of 5-FU (0.5 uM, 5 uM, 50 uM, 500 uM) or interferon gamma (IFN-γ, 10 ng/mL) in culture for 24 h and B7-H1 expression was quantified using flow cytometry and western blot analysis. We also evaluated B7-H1 expression, by immunohistochemistry, in tissue collected prior to and following neoadjuvant therapy in 10 EAC patients. B7-H1 expression in human HCT 116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> and HCT 116 p53<sup>-/-</sup> CRC cells lines, while low at baseline, can be induced by treatment with 5-FU. OE33 baseline B7-H1 expression exceeded CRC cell maximal expression and could be further increased in a dose dependent manner following 5-FU treatment in the absence of immune cells. We further demonstrate tumor B7-H1 expression in esophageal adenocarcinoma patient-derived pre-treatment biopsies. While B7-H1 expression was not enhanced in post-treatment esophagectomy specimens, this may be due to the limits of immunohistochemical quantification. B7-H1/PD-L1 expression can be increased following treatment with 5-FU in gastrointestinal cancer cell lines, suggesting alternative mechanisms to classic immune-mediated upregulation. This suggests that combining 5-FU treatment with PD-1/B7-H1 blockade may improve treatment in patients with gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma.",Journal Article,1190.0,22.0,Resistance to chemotherapy is a major obstacle in the effective treatment of cancer patients B7-homolog 1 also known as programmed death ligand-1 PD-L1 is an immunoregulatory protein that is overexpressed in several human cancers Interaction of B7-H1 with programmed death 1 PD-1 prevents T-cell activation and proliferation sequestering the T-cell receptor from the cell membrane inducing T-cell apoptosis thereby leading to cancer immunoresistance B7-H1 upregulation contributes to chemoresistance in several types of cancer but little is known with respect to changes associated with 5-fluorouracil 5-FU or cancers HCT 116 p53 sup +/+ /sup HCT 116 p53 sup -/- /sup cancer CRC and OE33 adenocarcinoma EAC cells were treated with increasing doses of 5-FU 0.5 uM 5 uM 50 uM 500 uM or interferon gamma IFN-γ 10 ng/mL in culture for 24 h and B7-H1 expression was quantified using flow cytometry and western blot analysis We also evaluated B7-H1 expression by immunohistochemistry in tissue collected prior to and following neoadjuvant therapy in 10 EAC patients B7-H1 expression in human HCT 116 p53 sup +/+ /sup and HCT 116 p53 sup -/- /sup CRC cells lines while low at baseline can be induced by treatment with 5-FU OE33 baseline B7-H1 expression exceeded CRC cell maximal expression and could be further increased in a dose dependent manner following 5-FU treatment in the absence of immune cells We further demonstrate tumor B7-H1 expression in adenocarcinoma patient-derived pre-treatment biopsies While B7-H1 expression was not enhanced in post-treatment esophagectomy specimens this may be due to the limits of immunohistochemical quantification B7-H1/PD-L1 expression can be increased following treatment with 5-FU in cancer cell lines suggesting alternative mechanisms to classic immune-mediated upregulation This suggests that combining 5-FU treatment with PD-1/B7-H1 blockade may improve treatment in patients with adenocarcinoma,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[251, 6, 56, 16, 8, 458, 7414, 4, 3, 323, 24, 1, 12, 7, 3181, 3412, 14, 120, 440, 22, 1846, 273, 1232, 14, 333, 729, 16, 35, 11288, 178, 17, 16, 1711, 4, 392, 171, 163, 915, 1, 3181, 5199, 5, 1846, 273, 14, 333, 14, 5217, 102, 31, 363, 2, 457, 19413, 3, 102, 31, 153, 29, 3, 31, 1905, 1958, 102, 31, 351, 2267, 1049, 6, 12, 33942, 3181, 5199, 2218, 2444, 6, 3782, 4, 392, 630, 1, 12, 84, 1215, 16, 440, 5, 2184, 6, 400, 41, 5, 33, 1404, 33, 1296, 15, 163, 1085, 3790, 624, 172, 172, 1085, 3790, 624, 172, 172, 12, 590, 2, 24039, 449, 3378, 37, 11, 73, 5, 602, 415, 1, 33, 1296, 13, 33, 5878, 33, 5878, 212, 5878, 1666, 5878, 15, 1688, 1705, 1256, 2655, 79, 997, 542, 4, 2099, 9, 259, 555, 2, 3181, 5199, 55, 10, 2790, 75, 1412, 1914, 2, 1521, 2639, 65, 21, 120, 194, 3181, 5199, 55, 20, 888, 4, 246, 786, 324, 6, 2, 366, 536, 36, 4, 79, 3378, 7, 3181, 5199, 55, 4, 171, 1085, 3790, 624, 172, 172, 2, 1085, 3790, 624, 172, 172, 590, 37, 285, 369, 154, 28, 330, 122, 40, 277, 20, 24, 5, 33, 1296, 24039, 330, 3181, 5199, 55, 4726, 590, 31, 2725, 55, 2, 359, 40, 195, 101, 4, 8, 61, 470, 1708, 366, 33, 1296, 24, 4, 3, 1127, 1, 250, 37, 21, 195, 608, 30, 3181, 5199, 55, 4, 449, 69, 526, 671, 24, 1154, 369, 3181, 5199, 55, 10, 44, 651, 4, 539, 24, 3617, 623, 26, 68, 40, 520, 6, 3, 3526, 1, 1382, 4752, 3181, 5199, 333, 729, 55, 122, 40, 101, 366, 24, 5, 33, 1296, 4, 12, 31, 285, 802, 1091, 483, 6, 3168, 250, 517, 2218, 26, 844, 17, 1525, 33, 1296, 24, 5, 333, 14, 3181, 5199, 1189, 68, 401, 24, 4, 7, 5, 449]",1938.0,27777774,63
Local Control and Toxicity of a Simultaneous Integrated Boost for Dose Escalation in Locally Advanced Esophageal Cancer: Interim Results from a Prospective Phase I/II Trial.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2016-10-26,"Approximately 50% of recurrences after standard-dose chemoradiation for locally advanced esophageal cancer occur within the gross tumor volume (GTV). In this prospective phase I/II clinical trial, we explored the use of a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) dose to the GTV. Forty-four patients with unresectable esophageal cancer received chemoradiation with an SIB of 58.8 to 63 Gy to the GTV and 50.4 Gy to the planning target volume, all in 28 fractions, with 5 weeks of concurrent docetaxel and fluorouracil or capecitabine. The end points were maximum tolerated dose, time to local failure, and clinical response. Excluding those with less than 6 months of follow-up, 38 patients were evaluated at the time of analysis. The median age was 65 years (range 37-84). Most patients (71%) were men; 84% had T3 disease, 37% had N1 disease, 26% had N2 disease, 13% had M1 disease, and 50% had adenocarcinoma. The maximum tolerated SIB dose was 63 Gy. None experienced Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 4 or 5 toxicity. At a median follow-up time of 13.3 months (range 1.2-36.2), 11 (29%) had local failure (median time to local failure 2.5 months [range 1.5-23.9]). A comparison with 97 similar patients who received 50.4 Gy without an SIB showed that the SIB reduced the local failure rate for patients with node-positive disease (13% versus 56%, p = 0.04), adenocarcinoma (26% versus 59%, p = 0.02), or stage III-IV disease (29% versus 55%, p = 0.04).

Multi-Institutional Prospective Study of Reirradiation with Proton Beam Radiotherapy for Locoregionally Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2016-11-05,"The management of recurrent NSCLC in the setting of prior radiation therapy is challenging. Proton radiotherapy (PRT) is ideally suited to minimize toxicity to previously irradiated organs. We report the safety/feasibility of PRT for NSCLC reirradiation in a prospective multi-institutional study. Between October 2010 and December 2015, 57 patients with recurrent NSCLC in or near their prior radiation field were treated at three proton centers. Patients were classified by tumor volume, location, and clinical characteristics. Toxicities were scored using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Survival outcomes were estimated by using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Fifty-two patients (93%) completed the reirradiation course. Their median age was 65 years (41-86). Patients with high tumor volume (clinical target volume-to-internal target volume ratio ≥250 cm<sup>3</sup>) were closed to enrollment owing to infeasibility in August 2012. Concurrent systemic therapy was delivered to 67% of patients. Fourteen patients (25%) had evidence of local (n = 9) or regional (n = 5) recurrence. Distant metastases after reirradiation developed in six patients (11%). The 1-year rates of overall and progression-free survival were 59% and 58%, respectively. In total, grade 3 or higher acute and/or late toxicity developed in 24 patients (42%), acute toxicity developed in 22 (39%), and late toxicity developed in seven (12%). Six grade 5 toxicities were observed. Increased overlap with the central airway region, mean esophagus and heart doses, and concurrent chemotherapy were associated with significantly higher rates of grade 3 or higher toxicity.

Obesity and Energy Balance in GI Cancer.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-11-07,"The prevalence of overweight (body mass index [BMI], 25 to 29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) have increased dramatically in the United States. Because increasing BMI is associated with the development of multiple different cancer types, including most GI cancers, providers will frequently encounter patients with GI cancer who are overweight or obese. Mounting evidence associates overweight and/or obesity with worsened prognosis in multiple GI cancers, including esophageal, gastric, hepatocellular, pancreatic, and colorectal. However, these data are observational and may be subject to bias and/or confounding. Furthermore, in some cancer types, the associations between BMI and outcomes is not linear, where overweight and class I obese patients may have an improvement in outcome. This report provides a brief highlight of existing studies that have linked overweight and/or obesity to prognosis in GI cancer; provides recommendations on best management practices; and discusses limitations, controversies, and future directions in this rapidly evolving area. There are multiple areas of promise that warrant continued investigation: What are the comparative contributions of energy balance, including weight, dietary patterns, and physical activity on cancer prognosis? What are the specific physiologic pathways that mediate the relationship between energy balance and prognosis? What is the relationship between low muscle mass (sarcopenia) or sarcopenic obesity and cancer prognosis? Are there subsets of patients for whom purposefully altering energy balance would be deleterious to prognosis?

Esophageal Cancer: Associations With (pN+) Lymph Node Metastases.,Annals of surgery,Ann.

Limited data and traditional analytic techniques have precluded identifying intricate associations of pN+ with other cancer, treatment, and patient characteristics. Data on 5806 esophagectomy patients from the Worldwide Esophageal Cancer Collaboration were analyzed by Random Forest machine learning techniques. pN+, number of positive nodes, and pN subclassification were associated with increasing depth of cancer invasion (pT), increasing cancer length, decreasing cancer differentiation (G), and more regional lymph nodes resected. Lymphadenectomy necessary to accurately detect pN+ is 60 for shorter, well-differentiated cancers (<2.5 cm) and 20 for longer, poorly differentiated ones. In esophageal cancer, pN+, increasing number of positive nodes, and increasing pN classification are associated with deeper invading, longer, and poorly differentiated cancers. Consequently, if the goal of lymphadenectomy is to accurately define pN+ status of such cancers, few nodes need to be removed.

D-mannose: a novel prognostic biomarker for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma.,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,2017-02-01,"Metabolomic profiling is a promising approach to identify new biomarkers for cancer prognosis. However, the role of circulating metabolites as prognostic indicators in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has not been well explored. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of three serum metabolites, d-mannose, l-proline (LP), and 3-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), which were significantly different between EAC patients and controls, identified through a global and targeted metabolite profiling. We measured the levels of d-mannose, LP, and BHBA in pretreatment serum from 159 EAC patients, using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods. A multivariable Cox model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the association of these metabolites with recurrence and overall survival. We found that serum levels of d-mannose were significantly associated with recurrence and overall survival in EAC patients, whereas levels of LP and BHBA were not. Compared with patients with a low (first tertile) level of d-mannose, those with a high (second plus third tertiles) level had 49% reduced risk of recurrence (HR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.29-0.91; P = 0.02), and 56% reduced risk of death (HR = 0.44; 95% CI: 0.25-0.77, P < 0.01).

Purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of a single linear measurement (short axis>10mm) of regional nodes on CT in predicting nodal metastasis, in patients with early esophageal cancer and whether using a mean diameter value (short axis+long axis/2) as well as nodal shape improves cN designation. CTs of 49 patients with cT1 adenocarcinoma treated with surgical resection alone were reviewed retrospectively. Regional nodes were considered positive for malignancy when round or ovoid and mean size>5mm adjacent to the primary tumor and>7mm when not adjacent. Results were compared with pN status after esophagectomy. 18/49 patients had pN+ at resection. Using a single short axis diameter>10mm on CT, nodal metastasis (cN) was positive in 7/49. Only 1 of these patients was pN+ at resection (sensitivity 5%, specificity 80%, accuracy 53%). Using mean size and morphologic criteria, cN was positive in 28/49. 11 of these patients were pN+ at resection (sensitivity 61%, specificity 45%, accuracy 51%).

Is endoscopic ultrasound examination necessary in the management of esophageal cancer?,World journal of gastroenterology,World J. Gastroenterol.,2017-02-01,"Despite substantial efforts at early diagnosis, accurate staging and advanced treatments, esophageal cancer (EC) continues to be an ominous disease worldwide. Risk factors for esophageal carcinomas include obesity, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hard-alcohol use and tobacco smoking. Five-year survival rates have improved from 5% to 20% since the 1970s, the result of advances in diagnostic staging and treatment. As the most sensitive test for locoregional staging of EC, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) influences the development of an optimal oncologic treatment plan for a significant minority of patients with early cancers, which appropriately balances the risks and benefits of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. EUS is costly, and may not be available at all centers. Thus, the yield of EUS needs to be thoughtfully considered for each patient. Localized intramucosal cancers occasionally require endoscopic resection (ER) for histologic staging or treatment; EUS evaluation may detect suspicious lymph nodes prior to exposing the patient to the risks of ER. Although positron emission tomography (PET) has been increasingly utilized in staging EC, it may be unnecessary for clinical staging of early, localized EC and carries the risk of false-positive metastasis (over staging). In EC patients with evidence of advanced disease, EUS or PET may be used to define the radiotherapy field. Multimodality staging with EUS, cross-sectional imaging and histopathologic analysis of ER, remains the standard-of-care in the evaluation of early esophageal cancers. Herein, published data regarding use of EUS for intramucosal, local, regional and metastatic esophageal cancers are reviewed.

Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Improvement of EAC patient outcome requires well-characterized animal models in which to evaluate novel therapeutics. In this study we aimed to establish a peritoneal dissemination xenograft mouse model of EAC that would support survival outcome analyses. To find the best candidate cell line from 7 human EAC cell lines of different origin named ESO26, OE33, ESO51, SK-GT-2, OE19, OACM5.1C and Flo-1 were injected intraperitoneally/subcutaneously into SCID mice. The peritoneal/xenograft tumor formation and mouse survival were compared among different groups. All cell lines injected subcutaneously formed tumors within 3 months at variable rates. All cell lines except OACM5.1C formed intraperitoneal tumors within 3 months at variable rates. Median animal survival with peritoneal dissemination was 108 days for ESO26 cells (5X106), 65 days for OE33 cells (5X106), 88 days for ESO51 cells (5X106), 76 days for SK-GT-2 cells (5X106), 55 days for OE19 cells (5X106), 45 days for OE19 cells (10X106) and 82 days for Flo-1 cells (5X106). Interestingly, only in the OE19 model all mice (7/7 for 5X106 and 5/5 for10X106) developed bloody ascites with liver metastasis after intraperitoneal injection. The median survival time of these animals was the shortest (45 days for 10X106 cells). In addition, median survival was significantly increased after paclitaxel treatment compared with the control group (57 days versus 45 days, p = 0.0034) along with a significant decrease of the relative subcutaneous tumor volume (p = 0.00011). Thus peritoneal dissemination mouse xenograft model for survival outcome assessment after intraperitoneal injection of OE19 cells will be very useful for the evaluation of cancer therapeutics.",Journal Article,1063.0,4.0,adenocarcinoma EAC has become the dominant type of cancer in United States The 5-year survival rate of EAC is below 20 and most patients present with locally advanced or widespread metastatic disease where current treatment is largely ineffective Therefore new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed Improvement of EAC patient outcome requires well-characterized animal models in which to evaluate novel therapeutics In this study we aimed to establish a peritoneal dissemination xenograft mouse model of EAC that would support survival outcome analyses To find the best candidate cell line from 7 human EAC cell lines of different origin named ESO26 OE33 ESO51 SK-GT-2 OE19 OACM5.1C and Flo-1 were injected intraperitoneally/subcutaneously into SCID mice The peritoneal/xenograft tumor formation and mouse survival were compared among different groups All cell lines injected subcutaneously formed tumors within 3 months at variable rates All cell lines except OACM5.1C formed intraperitoneal tumors within 3 months at variable rates Median animal survival with peritoneal dissemination was 108 days for ESO26 cells 5X106 65 days for OE33 cells 5X106 88 days for ESO51 cells 5X106 76 days for SK-GT-2 cells 5X106 55 days for OE19 cells 5X106 45 days for OE19 cells 10X106 and 82 days for Flo-1 cells 5X106 Interestingly only in the OE19 model all mice 7/7 for 5X106 and 5/5 for10X106 developed bloody ascites with metastasis after intraperitoneal injection The median survival time of these animals was the shortest 45 days for 10X106 cells In addition median survival was significantly increased after paclitaxel treatment compared with the control group 57 days versus 45 days p 0.0034 along with a significant decrease of the relative subcutaneous tumor volume p 0.00011 Thus peritoneal dissemination mouse xenograft model for survival outcome assessment after intraperitoneal injection of OE19 cells will be very useful for the evaluation of cancer therapeutics,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[449, 3378, 71, 1417, 3, 2156, 267, 1, 12, 4, 1088, 907, 3, 33, 111, 25, 116, 1, 3378, 16, 2736, 179, 2, 96, 7, 364, 5, 795, 131, 15, 3029, 113, 34, 1257, 291, 24, 16, 1733, 3957, 673, 217, 189, 611, 32, 5354, 575, 767, 1, 3378, 69, 228, 1706, 149, 765, 2026, 274, 4, 92, 6, 376, 229, 1943, 4, 26, 45, 21, 1295, 6, 1811, 8, 1639, 3430, 1330, 830, 202, 1, 3378, 17, 688, 538, 25, 228, 318, 6, 2469, 3, 824, 1609, 31, 328, 29, 67, 171, 3378, 31, 285, 1, 338, 1938, 8373, 50248, 24039, 32717, 9845, 6865, 18, 29493, 50249, 16452, 2, 35519, 14, 11, 2651, 10637, 3928, 237, 4129, 399, 3, 1639, 1330, 30, 1264, 2, 830, 25, 11, 72, 107, 338, 271, 62, 31, 285, 2651, 3928, 3516, 57, 262, 27, 53, 28, 1347, 151, 62, 31, 285, 2187, 50249, 16452, 3516, 3339, 57, 262, 27, 53, 28, 1347, 151, 52, 2026, 25, 5, 1639, 3430, 10, 3590, 162, 9, 50248, 37, 27589, 556, 162, 9, 24039, 37, 27589, 889, 162, 9, 32717, 37, 27589, 846, 162, 9, 9845, 6865, 18, 37, 27589, 614, 162, 9, 29493, 37, 27589, 512, 162, 9, 29493, 37, 50250, 2, 878, 162, 9, 35519, 14, 37, 27589, 2873, 158, 4, 3, 29493, 202, 62, 399, 67, 67, 9, 27589, 2, 33, 33, 69943, 276, 18830, 3819, 5, 278, 50, 3339, 1754, 3, 52, 25, 98, 1, 46, 2258, 10, 3, 10159, 512, 162, 9, 50250, 37, 4, 352, 52, 25, 10, 97, 101, 50, 490, 24, 72, 5, 3, 182, 87, 696, 162, 185, 512, 162, 19, 13, 19746, 1510, 5, 8, 93, 775, 1, 3, 580, 2529, 30, 433, 19, 13, 69944, 631, 1639, 3430, 830, 1330, 202, 9, 25, 228, 455, 50, 3339, 1754, 1, 29493, 37, 303, 40, 923, 999, 9, 3, 451, 1, 12, 1943]",1970.0,28225784,135
A Multi-Institutional Study Comparing the Use of the American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th Edition Esophageal <i>versus</i> Gastric Staging System for Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer in a Western Population.,The American surgeon,Am Surg,2017-01-01,"Controversy exists over the staging of gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinomas. The aim of our study was to assess the adequacy of the American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th edition esophageal (E7) and gastric (G7) staging systems for GEJ tumors in a western population. All patients with GEJ adenocarcinoma who underwent curative resection from 2000 to 2012 were identified from the United States Gastric Cancer Collaborative database and assessed according to the E7 and G7 systems. Fifty-one patients were identified. Neither the E7 nor G7 system adequately stratified patients by T or N stage with a loss of distinctiveness between T1 to 4 and N0 to 3 tumors. On final stage analysis, the outcomes were similar between both systems; however, neither system, with the exception of the G7 stage I versus II, adequately stratified patients by stage (E7: I vs II, P = 0.07; II vs III, P = 0.23; G7: I vs II, P = 0.02; II vs III, P = 0.13). Histologic grade was not associated with survival (P = 0.27) and did not improve the ability to stratify patients in the E7 system.

"Analysis of Factors Affecting Successful Clinical Trial Enrollment in the Context of Three Prospective, Randomized, Controlled Trials.","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2016-11-27,"Challenges can arise when attempting to maximize patient enrollment in clinical trials. There have been limited studies focusing on the barriers to enrollment and the efficacy of alternative study design to improve accrual. We analyzed barriers to clinical trial enrollment, particularly the influence of timing, in context of three prospective, randomized oncology trials where one arm was considered more aggressive than the other. From June 2011 to March 2015, patients who were enrolled on 3 prospective institutional protocols (an oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC] trial and 2 proton vs intensity modulated radiation therapy trials in NSCLC and esophageal cancer) were screened for protocol eligibility. Eligible candidates were approached about trial participation, and patient characteristics (age, sex, T/N categorization) were recorded along with details surrounding trial presentation (appointment number). Fisher's exact test, Student's t tests, and multivariate analysis were performed to assess differences between enrolled and refusal patients. A total of 309 eligible patients were approached about trial enrollment. The enrollment success rate during this time span was 52% (n=160 patients). Enrolled patients were more likely to be presented trial information at an earlier appointment (oligometastatic protocol: 5 vs 3 appointments [P<.001]; NSCLC protocol: 4 vs 3 appointments [P=.0018]; esophageal protocol: 3 vs 2 appointments [P=.0086]). No other factors or patient characteristics significantly affected enrollment success rate. Improvement in enrollment rates for randomized control trials is possible, even in difficult accrual settings. Earlier presentation of trial information to patients is the most influential factor for success and may help overcome accrual barriers without compromising trial design.",Journal Article,1150.0,7.0,Challenges can arise when attempting to maximize patient enrollment in clinical trials There have been limited studies focusing on the barriers to enrollment and the efficacy of alternative study design to improve accrual We analyzed barriers to clinical trial enrollment particularly the influence of timing in context of three prospective randomized oncology trials where one arm was considered more aggressive than the other From June 2011 to March 2015 patients who were enrolled on 3 prospective institutional protocols an oligometastatic cell cancer NSCLC trial and 2 proton vs intensity modulated radiation therapy trials in NSCLC and cancer were screened for protocol eligibility Eligible candidates were approached about trial participation and patient characteristics age sex T/N categorization were recorded along with details surrounding trial presentation appointment number Fisher 's exact test Student 's t tests and multivariate analysis were performed to assess differences between enrolled and refusal patients A total of 309 eligible patients were approached about trial enrollment The enrollment success rate during this time span was 52 n=160 patients Enrolled patients were more likely to be presented trial information at an earlier appointment oligometastatic protocol 5 vs 3 appointments P .001 NSCLC protocol 4 vs 3 appointments P=.0018 protocol 3 vs 2 appointments P=.0086 No other factors or patient characteristics significantly affected enrollment success rate Improvement in enrollment rates for randomized control trials is possible even in difficult accrual settings Earlier presentation of trial information to patients is the most influential factor for success and may help overcome accrual barriers without compromising trial design,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[1427, 122, 3043, 198, 9632, 6, 4116, 69, 1798, 4, 38, 143, 125, 47, 85, 383, 94, 3312, 23, 3, 2160, 6, 1798, 2, 3, 209, 1, 1091, 45, 771, 6, 401, 2262, 21, 311, 2160, 6, 38, 160, 1798, 823, 3, 1054, 1, 1972, 4, 1533, 1, 169, 482, 384, 413, 143, 1257, 104, 475, 10, 515, 80, 571, 76, 3, 127, 29, 1924, 1132, 6, 2363, 1483, 7, 54, 11, 346, 23, 27, 482, 1115, 2189, 35, 4101, 31, 12, 304, 160, 2, 18, 2095, 105, 837, 1757, 121, 36, 143, 4, 304, 2, 12, 11, 2261, 9, 1182, 2317, 625, 1931, 11, 5738, 545, 160, 2599, 2, 69, 374, 89, 1035, 102, 78, 8872, 11, 1872, 1510, 5, 3791, 2976, 160, 1031, 9698, 207, 3135, 292, 2472, 412, 6390, 292, 102, 895, 2, 331, 65, 11, 173, 6, 423, 362, 59, 346, 2, 8104, 7, 8, 181, 1, 9440, 625, 7, 11, 5738, 545, 160, 1798, 3, 1798, 1825, 116, 190, 26, 98, 7165, 10, 653, 78, 3457, 7, 346, 7, 11, 80, 322, 6, 40, 917, 160, 487, 28, 35, 1677, 9698, 4101, 1182, 33, 105, 27, 9829, 19, 144, 304, 1182, 39, 105, 27, 9829, 19, 11995, 1182, 27, 105, 18, 9829, 19, 21308, 77, 127, 130, 15, 69, 374, 97, 1424, 1798, 1825, 116, 767, 4, 1798, 151, 9, 384, 182, 143, 16, 899, 871, 4, 1740, 2262, 1947, 1677, 1031, 1, 160, 487, 6, 7, 16, 3, 96, 11741, 161, 9, 1825, 2, 68, 987, 1768, 2262, 2160, 187, 6102, 160, 771]",1769.0,28244413,91
A Multicenter Study of a Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization Probe Set for Diagnosing High-Grade Dysplasia and Adenocarcinoma in Barrett's Esophagus.,Digestive diseases and sciences,Dig. Dis. Sci.,2017-03-06,"Preliminary single-institution data suggest that fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may be useful for detecting high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) in patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE). This multicenter study aims to validate the measurement of polysomy (gain of at least two loci) by FISH as a way to discriminate degrees of dysplasia in BE specimens. Tissue specimens were collected from four different hospitals and read by both the local pathology department (""Site diagnosis"") and a single central pathologist (""Review diagnosis"") at a separate institution. The specimens then underwent FISH analysis using probes 8q24 (MYC), 9p21 (CDKN2A), 17q12 (ERBB2), and 20q13 (ZNF217) for comparison. A total of 46 non-BE, 42 non-dysplastic specialized intestinal metaplasia (SIM), 23 indefinite-grade dysplasia (IGD), 10 low-grade dysplasia (LGD), 29 HGD, and 42 EA specimens were analyzed. We found that polysomy, as detected by FISH, was the predominant chromosomal abnormality present as dysplasia increased. Polysomy was also the best predictor for the presence of dysplasia or EA when comparing its area under the curve to that of other FISH abnormalities. We observed that if at least 10% of cells had polysomy within a specimen, the FISH probe was able to differentiate between EA/HGD and the remaining pathologies with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 88%.

In vivo dosimetry with optically stimulated luminescent dosimeters for conformal and intensity-modulated radiation therapy: A 2-year multicenter cohort study.,Practical radiation oncology,Pract Radiat Oncol,2016-09-07,"Optically stimulated luminescent dosimeters (OSLDs) are utilized for in vivo dosimetry (IVD) of modern radiation therapy techniques such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Dosimetric precision achieved with conventional techniques may not be attainable. In this work, we measured accuracy and precision for a large sample of clinical OSLD-based IVD measurements. Weekly IVD measurements were collected from 4 linear accelerators for 2 years and were expressed as percent differences from planned doses. After outlier analysis, 10,224 measurements were grouped in the following way: overall, modality (photons, electrons), treatment technique (3-dimensional [3D] conformal, field-in-field intensity modulation, inverse-planned IMRT, and VMAT), placement location (gantry angle, cardinality, and central axis positioning), and anatomical site (prostate, breast, head and neck, pelvis, lung, rectum and anus, brain, abdomen, esophagus, and bladder). Distributions were modeled via a Gaussian function. Fitting was performed with least squares, and goodness-of-fit was assessed with the coefficient of determination. Model means (μ) and standard deviations (σ) were calculated. Sample means and variances were compared for statistical significance by analysis of variance and the Levene tests (α = 0.05). Overall, μ ± σ was 0.3 ± 10.3%. Precision for electron measurements (6.9%) was significantly better than for photons (10.5%). Precision varied significantly among treatment techniques (P < .0001) with field-in-field lowest (σ = 7.2%) and IMRT and VMAT highest (σ = 11.9% and 13.4%, respectively). Treatment site models with goodness-of-fit greater than 0.90 (6 of 10) yielded accuracy within ±3%, except for head and neck (μ = -3.7%). Precision varied with treatment site (range, 7.3%-13.0%), with breast and head and neck yielding the best and worst precision, respectively. Placement on the central axis of cardinal gantry angles yielded more precise results (σ = 8.5%) compared with other locations (range, 10.5%-11.4%). Accuracy of ±3% was achievable. Precision ranged from 6.9% to 13.4% depending on modality, technique, and treatment site. Simple, standardized locations may improve IVD precision.

Precancer Atlas to Drive Precision Prevention Trials.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2017-04-01,"Cancer development is a complex process driven by inherited and acquired molecular and cellular alterations. Prevention is the holy grail of cancer elimination, but making this a reality will take a fundamental rethinking and deep understanding of premalignant biology. In this Perspective, we propose a national concerted effort to create a Precancer Atlas (PCA), integrating multi-omics and immunity - basic tenets of the neoplastic process. The biology of neoplasia caused by germline mutations has led to paradigm-changing precision prevention efforts, including: tumor testing for mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency in Lynch syndrome establishing a new paradigm, combinatorial chemoprevention efficacy in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), signal of benefit from imaging-based early detection research in high-germline risk for pancreatic neoplasia, elucidating early ontogeny in <i>BRCA1</i>-mutation carriers leading to an international breast cancer prevention trial, and insights into the intricate germline-somatic-immunity interaction landscape. Emerging genetic and pharmacologic (metformin) disruption of mitochondrial (mt) respiration increased autophagy to prevent cancer in a Li-Fraumeni mouse model (biology reproduced in clinical pilot) and revealed profound influences of subtle changes in mt DNA background variation on obesity, aging, and cancer risk. The elaborate communication between the immune system and neoplasia includes an increasingly complex cellular microenvironment and dynamic interactions between host genetics, environmental factors, and microbes in shaping the immune response. Cancer vaccines are in early murine and clinical precancer studies, building on the recent successes of immunotherapy and HPV vaccine immune prevention.

The Impact of a Prior Diagnosis of Barrett's Esophagus on Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Survival.,The American journal of gastroenterology,Am. J. Gastroenterol.,2017-04-04,"Endoscopic surveillance of patients with Barrett's Esophagus (BE) is recommended to detect esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and its dysplasia precursors, but survival benefits are unclear. Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and linked Medicare data, we sought to determine the impact of a prior BE diagnosis on survival in patients with EAC. Our analysis focused on patients over age 65 with primary EAC diagnosed in a SEER region from 2000-2011 and enrolled in Medicare. We identified patients with preexisting BE prior to EAC diagnosis and compared this group to EAC patients without a prior BE diagnosis. A Cox Proportional Hazards model compared survival and included variables such as age, sex, cancer stage, treatment, and medical comorbidities. Among 4,978 SEER-Medicare patients identified with EAC, 577 (12%) had preexisting BE; 4,401 (88%) did not. BE patients had overall lower stage (28.5% stage I vs. 12.8% stage IV) than those without preexisting BE (16.4% stage I vs. 30.6% stage IV). Overall survival was better among patients in the BE group (hazard ratio (HR), 0.56; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.50-0.61); this benefit persisted in the adjusted model (HR, 0.72; 95%, 0.65-0.80). After adjusting for lead-time bias, the HRs attenuated to the null, with an unadjusted HR of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.86-1.05, P=0.39) and adjusted HR of 0.99 (CI: 0.89-1.10, P=0.92).

Antitumor effects of cyclin dependent kinase 9 inhibition in esophageal adenocarcinoma.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2017-04-01,"Role of cyclin dependent kinase 9(CDK9) as a potential target in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is unknown. We investigated CDK9 protein expression in EAC and Barrett's esophagus and role of CDK9 in oncogenic processes of EAC in vitro and in murine xenografts. The CDK9 expression was significantly higher in EAC as compared to Barrett's esophagus in patient samples. Stable shCDK9 in SKGT4 reduced proliferation by 37% at day 4, increased apoptosis at 48 hours and induced G1 cell cycle arrest at 48 hours (58.4% vs. 45.8%) compared to controls SKGT4 cells. SKGT4-shCDK9 cell-derived tumors were significantly smaller than control SKGT4-derived tumors in xenografts (72.89mm3 vs. 270mm3). Pharmaceutical inhibition of CDK9 by Flavopiridol (0.1µm for 48 hours) and CAN508 (20 and 40µm for 72 hours) induced significant reduction in proliferation and 2-fold increase in apoptosis in SKGT4, FLO1 and OE33 cells. In xenograft models, CAN508 (60 mg/kg/dayx10 days) and Flavopiridol (4mg/kg/dayx10 days) caused 50.8% and 63.1% reduction in xenograft tumors as compared to control on post-treatment day 21.

Esophageal epithelial tissues were collected and assessed for markers of oxidative stress and nuclear factor κB (NFκB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). BRB reduced the incidence of esophageal cancer from 100% in NMBA-treated rats to 81.5% in rats treated with NMBA plus BRB (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Tumor multiplicity was reduced from 4.73 ± 0.45 tumors per esophagus in NMBA-treated rats to 1.44 ± 0.26 in rats treated with NMBA plus BRB (<i>p</i> < 0.001).

Multi-institutional analysis of radiation modality use and postoperative outcomes of neoadjuvant chemoradiation for esophageal cancer.,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,Radiother Oncol,2017-04-25,"Relative radiation dose exposure to vital organs in the thorax could influence clinical outcomes in esophageal cancer (EC). We assessed whether the type of radiation therapy (RT) modality used was associated with postoperative outcomes after neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT). Contemporary data from 580 EC patients treated with nCRT at 3 academic institutions from 2007 to 2013 were reviewed. 3D conformal RT (3D), intensity modulated RT (IMRT) and proton beam therapy (PBT) were used for 214 (37%), 255 (44%), and 111 (19%) patients, respectively. Postoperative outcomes included pulmonary, GI, cardiac, wound healing complications, length of in-hospital stay (LOS), and 90-day postoperative mortality. Cox model fits, and log-rank tests both with and without Inverse Probability of treatment Weighting (IPW) were used to correct for bias due to non-randomization. RT modality was significantly associated with the incidence of pulmonary, cardiac and wound complications, which also bore out on multivariate analysis. Mean LOS was also significantly associated with treatment modality (13.2days for 3D (95%CI 11.7-14.7), 11.6days for IMRT (95%CI 10.9-12.7), and 9.3days for PBT (95%CI 8.2-10.3) (p<0.0001)).

Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with or without surgery for patients with resectable esophageal cancer: An analysis of the National Cancer Data Base.,Cancer,Cancer,2017-05-02,"Patients with resectable esophageal cancer (rEC) are managed with either concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery (CRSx) or concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone (cCR). To the authors' knowledge, there is insufficient evidence comparing the overall survival of patients treated with these 2 options. The National Cancer Data Base was queried for rEC cases diagnosed from 2003 through 2011. Patients with previous cancers, cervical rEC, clinical stage T1N0 disease, or metastasis were excluded. cCR was defined as radiotherapy administered within 30 days of chemotherapy. CRSx was defined as cCR followed by esophagectomy within 90 days. Overall survival was compared using Kaplan-Meier methods, propensity score matching, and extended Cox proportional hazards models. Of the 11,122 eligible patients, 8091 (72.7%) received cCR and 3031 (27.3%) received CRSx. The odds of receiving CRSx were higher among patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage II disease (vs stage III), adenocarcinoma (vs squamous cell carcinoma), lesions of the lower one-third of the esophagus, private insurance, and those living >25 miles from the treating facility or in areas with a higher median income or a greater percentage of high school-educated residents. Patients aged >70 years, female patients, African-American patients, those with ≥2 comorbidities, or those treated at community programs were more likely to receive cCR. After propensity score matching, the median and 10-year survival rates were found to be significantly better with CRSx (32.5 months [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 29.6-34.8 months] and 23.8% months [95% CI, 20.0-27.9 months], respectively) compared with cCR (14.2 months [95% CI, 13.4-15.5 months] and 6.1% months [95% CI, 3.9-9.0 months], respectively). Data from the National Cancer Data Base support the inclusion of surgery after concurrent chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced rEC.

A Multi-institutional Analysis of Trimodality Therapy for Esophageal Cancer in Elderly Patients.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2017-02-20,"The therapeutic gains of neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (nCRT) followed by esophagectomy may be offset by increased incidences of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients. This study aimed to determine the impact of age on the risks and benefits of trimodality therapy for esophageal cancer. We evaluated 571 patients treated with trimodality therapy at 3 high-volume tertiary cancer centers in the United States from 2007 to 2013. Two hundred two of 571 (35%) patients were 65 years or older at diagnosis and were classified as elderly. Toxicity and treatment parameters for the elderly cohort were compared with the younger cohort (ages 22-64) by the use of univariate (UVA) and multivariable (MVA) logistic analyses. Age was analyzed as a continuous hazard for cardiac and pulmonary toxicities. Survival was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Elderly patients had a higher risk for postoperative cardiac toxicities (UVA: odds ratio [OR] 2.2, P<.001; MVA: OR 2.07, P=.004) and pulmonary toxicities (UVA: OR 2.0, P<.001; MVA: OR 2.03, P<.001) and a higher 90-day postoperative mortality (5.4% vs 2.2%, P=.049). Of the elderly patients, 6.9% experienced acute respiratory distress syndrome compared with 3.8% of younger patients (P=.11). Cardiac toxicity was linearly associated with age, and the relative risk increased by 61% for every additional decade of age. There was no difference in postoperative gastrointestinal or wound adverse events or in length of hospital stay. Grade 3+ acute toxicities from nCRT were infrequent and were clinically similar regardless of age. Freedom from esophageal cancer and disease-free survival were similar, but overall survival was significantly shorter in the elderly cohort. Elderly patients experienced more postoperative cardiopulmonary toxicities and mortality than did younger patients after nCRT. Compared with contemporary outcomes for trimodality therapy, both cohorts had acceptable rates for adverse events and disease control. For appropriately selected elderly patients, trimodality therapy for esophageal cancer is a reasonable treatment option.",Comparative Study,1065.0,8.0,The therapeutic gains of neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy nCRT followed by esophagectomy may be offset by increased incidences of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients This study aimed to determine the impact of age on the risks and benefits of trimodality therapy for cancer We evaluated 571 patients treated with trimodality therapy at 3 high-volume tertiary cancer centers in the United States from 2007 to 2013 Two hundred two of 571 35 patients were 65 years or older at diagnosis and were classified as elderly Toxicity and treatment parameters for the elderly cohort were compared with the younger cohort ages 22-64 by the use of univariate UVA and multivariable MVA logistic analyses Age was analyzed as a continuous hazard for and pulmonary toxicities Survival was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method Elderly patients had a higher risk for postoperative toxicities UVA odds ratio OR 2.2 P .001 MVA OR 2.07 P=.004 and pulmonary toxicities UVA OR 2.0 P .001 MVA OR 2.03 P .001 and a higher 90-day postoperative mortality 5.4 vs 2.2 P=.049 Of the elderly patients 6.9 experienced acute respiratory distress syndrome compared with 3.8 of younger patients P=.11 toxicity was linearly associated with age and the relative risk increased by 61 for every additional decade of age There was no difference in postoperative or wound adverse events or in length of hospital stay Grade 3+ acute toxicities from nCRT were infrequent and were clinically similar regardless of age Freedom from cancer and disease-free survival were similar but overall survival was significantly shorter in the elderly cohort Elderly patients experienced more postoperative cardiopulmonary toxicities and mortality than did younger patients after nCRT Compared with contemporary outcomes for trimodality therapy both cohorts had acceptable rates for adverse events and disease control For appropriately selected elderly patients trimodality therapy for cancer is a reasonable treatment option,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,"[3, 189, 3849, 1, 536, 975, 36, 8353, 370, 20, 3617, 68, 40, 9500, 20, 101, 3981, 1, 787, 2, 282, 4, 1216, 7, 26, 45, 1295, 6, 223, 3, 345, 1, 89, 23, 3, 1098, 2, 1141, 1, 4625, 36, 9, 12, 21, 194, 7846, 7, 73, 5, 4625, 36, 28, 27, 64, 433, 2557, 12, 1168, 4, 3, 1088, 907, 29, 1307, 6, 1346, 100, 1128, 100, 1, 7846, 465, 7, 11, 556, 60, 15, 434, 28, 147, 2, 11, 1373, 22, 1216, 155, 2, 24, 1038, 9, 3, 1216, 180, 11, 72, 5, 3, 773, 180, 2165, 350, 660, 20, 3, 119, 1, 880, 14044, 2, 658, 5320, 812, 318, 89, 10, 311, 22, 8, 1314, 360, 9, 2, 1087, 385, 25, 10, 275, 20, 3, 876, 882, 596, 1216, 7, 42, 8, 142, 43, 9, 573, 385, 14044, 610, 197, 15, 18, 18, 19, 144, 5320, 15, 18, 1615, 19, 1520, 2, 1087, 385, 14044, 15, 18, 13, 19, 144, 5320, 15, 18, 680, 19, 144, 2, 8, 142, 424, 218, 573, 282, 33, 39, 105, 18, 18, 19, 5121, 1, 3, 1216, 7, 49, 83, 592, 286, 2718, 1462, 681, 72, 5, 27, 66, 1, 773, 7, 19, 175, 155, 10, 9853, 41, 5, 89, 2, 3, 580, 43, 101, 20, 713, 9, 454, 402, 2025, 1, 89, 125, 10, 77, 523, 4, 573, 15, 2689, 290, 281, 15, 4, 1318, 1, 702, 2020, 88, 27, 286, 385, 29, 8353, 11, 4475, 2, 11, 505, 288, 1583, 1, 89, 3060, 29, 12, 2, 34, 115, 25, 11, 288, 84, 63, 25, 10, 97, 985, 4, 3, 1216, 180, 1216, 7, 592, 80, 573, 7744, 385, 2, 282, 76, 205, 773, 7, 50, 8353, 72, 5, 2667, 123, 9, 4625, 36, 110, 736, 42, 1595, 151, 9, 290, 281, 2, 34, 182, 9, 4544, 715, 1216, 7, 4625, 36, 9, 12, 16, 8, 3203, 24, 1501]",1976.0,28476435,615
Hospital Minimally Invasive Surgery Utilization for Gastrointestinal Cancer.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2018-08-01,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of receiving care at high minimally invasive surgery (MIS)-utilizing hospitals BACKGROUND:: MIS techniques are used across surgical specialties. The extent of MIS utilization for gastrointestinal (GI) cancer resection and impact of receiving care at high utilizing hospitals is unclear. This is a retrospective cohort study of 137,581 surgically resected esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, hepatobiliary, colon, and rectal cancer patients within the National Cancer Data Base (2010-2013). Disease-specific, hospital-level, reliability-adjusted MIS utilization rates were calculated to evaluate perioperative outcomes. Among patients for whom adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) was indicated, the association between days to AC and hospital MIS utilization was examined using generalized estimating equations. Association with risk of death was evaluated using multivariable Cox regression. Disease-specific MIS use increased significantly [42.0%-68.3% increase; trend test, P < 0.001 for all except hepatobiliary (P = 0.007)] over time. Most hospitals [range-30.3% (colon); 92.9% (pancreatic)] were low utilizers (≤30% of cases). Higher MIS utilization is associated with increased lymph nodes examined (P < 0.001, all) and shorter length of stay (P < 0.001, all). Each 10% increase in MIS utilization is associated with fewer days to AC [3.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-5.3) for MIS gastric; 3.3 ([0.7-5.8) for open gastric; 1.1 (0.3-2.0) days for open colon].

We evaluated the association between various clinical variables (location of the primary, location of metastases, duration of initial chemotherapy, histologic grade, and radiation dose) and overall survival (OS). Of 101 patients, 71 had a proximal primary (esophageal, Siewert type I or II), and 30 patients had a distal primary (Siewert type III or distal). The median OS was 25.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 22.3-32.8). The OS rates at 2 and 5 years were 53.8% (95% CI 44.7-64.8) and 20.7% (95% CI 13.4-31.9), respectively.

Post-trimodality expression levels of metadherin (MTDH) as a prognostic biomarker for esophageal adenocarcinoma patients.,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",Med. Oncol.,2017-07-06,"Resectable esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) patients often receive chemoradiation followed by surgery. However, most patients experience recurrences. Overexpression of MTDH, an oncoprotein with multiple functions, has been found to be associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer, glioblastoma, melanoma and various gastrointestinal malignancies, but not in EAC. We sought to establish its role in resistant EAC (post-treatment residual EAC). MTDH was assessed by immunohistochemistry in resected EAC, and results were correlated with clinical outcomes. MTDH expression was detectable in 72.5% (50/69) of patients, while expression levels were high (positive) in 50.7% (35/69). Of 69 patients analyzed, 25 had no relapse and 44 patients had a relapse (8 with local-regional and 36 with distant). The median follow-up duration was 3 years (0.4-11.6). The median overall survival was not associated with MTDH status (2.79 years for MTDH-negative and 3.60 years for MTDH-positive patients, p = 0.121). In addition, MTDH was not associated with either the type of relapse (local or distant), baseline clinical stage, tumor grade, presence of signet ring cells, surgical (yp) stage, percentage of residual EAC or presence of lymphovascular invasion.

Proton Beam Radiotherapy and Concurrent Chemotherapy for Unresectable Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Final Results of a Phase 2 Study.,JAMA oncology,JAMA Oncol,2017-08-10,"Proton beam radiotherapy (PBT) has the potential to reduce toxic effects in the definitive management of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but long-term prospective data are lacking. To report the final (5-year) results of a prospective study evaluating concurrent chemotherapy and high-dose PBT to treat unresectable stage III NSCLC. In this open-label, single-group assignment study, with median follow-up of 27.3 months for all patients and 79.6 months for survivors, 64 patients were enrolled and analyzed; inclusion criteria were unresectable IIIA/IIIB histologically confirmed NSCLC, Karnofsky performance status 70 to 100, and 6-month prediagnosis weight loss of no more than 10%. Staging used positron emission tomography and/or computed tomography. Induction chemotherapy was allowed. Concurrent chemotherapy (carboplatin-paclitaxel) and passively scattered PBT (74-Gy relative biological effectiveness) in all patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), actuarial distant metastasis, and locoregional recurrence. Patterns of treatment failure were categorized as local/regional or distant. Acute and late toxic effects were prospectively assigned using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v3.0. Of 64 patients (22 [34%] female; median [range] age, 70 [37-78] years; stage IIIA, 30 [47%]; IIIB, 34 [53%]), 17 (27%) were alive at last follow-up. Median OS was 26.5 months (5-year OS, 29%; 95% CI, 18%-41%). Five-year PFS was 22% (95% CI, 12%-32%); 5-year actuarial distant metastasis and locoregional recurrence were 54% (n = 36) and 28% (n = 22), respectively. Treatment failures were largely (31 [48%] patients) distant, with low rates of crude local (10 [16%]) and regional (9 [14%]) recurrences. Rates of grade 2 and 3 acute esophagitis were 18 (28%) and 5 (8%), respectively. Acute grade 2 pneumonitis occurred in 1 (2%) patient. Late toxic effects were uncommon: 1 (2%) patient developed an esophageal stricture (grade 2) and 1 (2%) grade 4 esophagitis. Late grades 2 and 3 pneumonitis occurred in 10 (16%) and 8 (12%), respectively. Two (3%) patients developed a bronchial stricture (grade 2), and 1 (2%) a grade 4 bronchial fistula.

Recurrence patterns and associated factors of locoregional failure following neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgery for esophageal cancer.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2017-08-22,"Despite neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT) followed by esophagectomy for locally advanced esophageal cancer, locoregional recurrence (LRR) is common and factors associated with LRR have not been clearly identified. Patients were identified from a single institution, prospectively maintained database (1996-2013). Patterns of recurrence were described and associated factors of LRR were analyzed using competing risks regression models. Of the 456 patients treated with nCRT and surgery, 167 patients developed recurrence. Locoregional and distant recurrences were observed in 69 (15.1%) and 140 (30.9%) patients, respectively. Time to recurrence (13.6 vs 10.4 months, P = 0.20) and median overall survival (29.3 vs 19.1 months, P = 0.12) were no different among the 27 patients (6%) who developed a solitary LRR compared to patients who developed distant recurrence. Univariable analysis identified lymphovascular invasion (HR 1.46, P = 0.07), lymph node ratio >0.5 (HR 2.16, P = 0.02), positive margin (HR 1.95, P = 0.05), lack of response to neoadjuvant therapy (HR 1.99, P < 0.01), clinical T stage (HR 2.62, P < 0.01) and final T3/4 stage (HR 2.06, P < 0.01) as factors significantly associated with LRR.

Adenosquamous Carcinoma of the Esophagus: An NCDB-Based Investigation on Comparative Features and Overall Survival in a Rare Tumor.,Oncology,Oncology,2017-08-24,"Esophageal adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC) is a rare tumor with characteristics of adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), the two most common esophageal cancers. Its behavior is aggressive but poorly understood. Using the National Cancer Database (NCDB), the clinical features and overall survival of ASC were compared with AC and SCC. The NCDB was queried for patients with esophageal ASC, AC, and SCC. Univariate association of histology with patient characteristics and overall survival were analyzed and socioeconomic characteristics were balanced. Clinical M stage was 0 in a significantly lower proportion of ASC (69.0%) than in AC (70.9%) or SCC (75.6%) (p < 0.001). Median survival was lower in patients with ASC (9.6 months) than with AC (13.5) or SCC (9.7) and 2-year OS was lower in patients with ASC (23.8%) than with AC (34.6%) or SCC (26.5%) (p < 0.001). The OS hazard ratio for ASC was 1.14 when compared to AC (95% CI = 1.016-1.267, p = 0.025) and 1.10 when compared to SCC, but the latter was not significant (95% CI = 0.980-1.222, p = 0.111).

Pathological complete response in patients with esophageal cancer after the trimodality approach: The association with baseline variables and survival-The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center experience.,Cancer,Cancer,2017-09-08,"Reports are limited regarding clinical and pretreatment features that might predict a pathological complete response (pathCR) after treatment in patients with esophageal cancer (EC). This might allow patient selection for different strategies. This study examines the association of a pathCR with pretreatment variables, overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and patterns of recurrence in a large cohort from a single institution. The baseline clinical features of 911 consecutive patients with EC who were treated with trimodality therapy from January 2000 to November 2013 were analyzed. A pathCR was defined as a surgical specimen with no residual carcinoma (primary or nodes). Logistic regressions were used to identify independent baseline features associated with a pathCR. We applied log-rank testing and Cox models to determine the association between a pathCR and the time-to-event outcomes (OS and RFS). Of 911 patients, 218 (23.9%) achieved a pathCR. The pathCR rate was 23.1% for adenocarcinoma and 32.2% for squamous cell carcinoma. A lower pathCR rate was observed for 1) older patients (>60 years), 2) patients with poorly differentiated tumors, 3) patients with signet ring cells (SRCs), and 4) patients with a higher T stage. Patients with a pathCR had longer OS and RFS than those without a pathCR (P = .0021 and P = .0011, respectively). Recurrences occurred more in non-pathCR patients. Distant metastases were the most common type of recurrence. PathCR patients developed brain metastases at a marginally higher rate than non-pathCR patients (P = .051).

A phase I open-label dose-escalation study of the anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody LJM716 in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus or head and neck and HER2-overexpressing breast or gastric cancer.,BMC cancer,BMC Cancer,2017-09-12,"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) is important in maintaining epidermal growth factor receptor-driven cancers and mediating resistance to targeted therapy. A phase I study of anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody LJM716 was conducted with the primary objective to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended dose for expansion (RDE), and dosing schedule. Secondary objectives were to characterize safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity. This open-label, dose-finding study comprised dose escalation, followed by expansion in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck or esophagus, and HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer or gastric cancer. During dose escalation, patients received LJM716 intravenous once weekly (QW) or every two weeks (Q2W), in 28-day cycles. An adaptive Bayesian logistic regression model was used to guide dose escalation and establish the RDE. Exploratory pharmacodynamic tumor studies evaluated modulation of HER3 signaling. Patients received LJM716 3-40 mg/kg QW and 20 mg/kg Q2W (54 patients; 36 patients at 40 mg/kg QW). No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported during dose-escalation. One patient experienced two DLTs (diarrhea, hypokalemia [both grade 3]) in the expansion phase. The RDE was 40 mg/kg QW, providing drug levels above the preclinical minimum effective concentration. One patient with gastric cancer had an unconfirmed partial response; 17/54 patients had stable disease, two lasting >30 weeks. Down-modulation of phospho-HER3 was observed in paired tumor samples. LJM716 was well tolerated; the MTD was not reached, and the RDE was 40 mg/kg QW. Further development of LJM716 is ongoing.

Extreme chromosome 17 copy number instability is a prognostic factor in patients with gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma: A retrospective cohort study.,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",Genes Chromosomes Cancer,2017-10-30,"Gastric and esophageal cancers frequently show genomic instability and aneuploidy. Chromosomal copy number instability (CIN) is a form of genomic instability that exerts pleiotropic effects on cellular biology and is a source of genetic heterogeneity in a population of cells. CIN results in cell-to-cell variation in chromosome copy number which can be detected and quantified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). CIN is a biomarker associated with differential response to a number of chemotherapy compounds. We quantified chromosome 17 copy number instability (CIN-17) in 348 gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas by centromeric FISH in cases that were tested for HER2 amplification. We evaluated the association between CIN-17 and clinical outcome after surgical and nonsurgical treatment. CIN-17 was detected in 45.4% (158/348) and extreme CIN-17 in 28.4% (99/348). Extreme CIN-17 had no association with outcome in surgically treated patients. However, in patients treated with conventional radiation and/or chemotherapy, extreme CIN-17 was associated with 55% reduction in overall mortality (hazard ratio, 0.448; 95% confidence interval, 0.263-0.763) after adjusting for age and clinical stage at diagnosis.

Yield of p53 expression in esophageal squamous cell cancer and its relationship with survival.,Saudi journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Saudi Gastroenterology Association,Saudi J Gastroenterol,,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the most aggressive type of cancer. Mutation of tumor suppressor gene p53 is observed in many gastrointestinal malignancies including ESCC. The immunohistochemical protein expression of mutant p53 has been proposed as a potential tool to evaluate the biological behavior of ESCC. Predictive value of p53 for survival is debatable, hence this study was formulated to know the survival of patients with p53 expression in ESCC. We prospectively included 91 consecutive patients of ESCC from August 2014 to August 2016. Biopsy specimens were treated immunohistochemically and expression of p53 gene was analyzed by Immunoreactive Score (IRS). These findings were then compared with clinicopathological parameters such as age, gender, histological grades, and TNM stages. All patients received treatment and were kept under regular follow-up. M: F ratio was 2.03:1. p53 expression analyzed by IRS showed low expression (score ≤6) in 35 patients (38.46%) and high expression (>6) in 56 patients (61.54%).

Ambiguity of Whole Body PET CT Scans in Diagnosis of Co-existing Tuberculosis and Malignancy: Is Histopathological Confirmation Mandatory?,The Gulf journal of oncology,Gulf J Oncolog,2017-09-01,"Whole body PET CT is an important investigation tool in malignancy patients and helps in ascertaining the metabolic activity and exact stage of the disease. However, like any other investigation, false positive results do exist and certain diseases other than cancer may show increased uptake. Hence, a careful evaluation of PET CT and clinical correlation in malignancy patients is a must to accomplish the suitable treatment. In this retrospective observational study, seven cases of cancer with concomitant tuberculosis were included. All the patients were proven malignancy patients with advanced or metastatic stage. On clinical suspicion, a tissue diagnosis was obtained which led to change in staging as well as management of the patients. Seven patients were having primary diagnosis of carcinoma breast, carcinoma esophagus, coepidermoid carcinoma of submandibular salivary gland, carcinoma tongue, squamous cell carcinoma skin, carcinoma cervix and carcinoma endometrium. They showed FDG uptake at distant sites leading to upstaging of disease. On histopathological examination, lymph nodal mass reported granulomatous lymphadenitis, leading to change of overall staging and management of the patients. Whole Body PET CT scan may produce false positive results and upstage the disease.

Management of Patients With Adenocarcinoma or Squamous Cancer of the Esophagus.,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,2017-10-14,"Esophageal cancer is characterized by early and frequent metastasis. Surgery is the primary treatment for early-stage disease, whereas patients with patients with locally advanced disease receive perioperative chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Squamous cancers can be treated with primary chemoradiotherapy without surgery, depending on their response to therapy and patient tolerance for subsequent surgery. Chemotherapy with a fluorinated pyrimidine and a platinum agent, followed by later treatment with taxanes and irinotecan, provides some benefit. Agents that inhibit the erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2 or HER2), or vascular endothelial growth factor, including trastuzumab, ramucirumab, and apatinib, increase response and survival times. Esophageal adenocarcinomas have mutations in tumor protein p53 and mutations that activate receptor-associated tyrosine kinase, vascular endothelial growth factor, and cell cycle pathways, whereas esophageal squamous tumors have a distinct set of mutations.

Expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas of the digestive system: a potential target for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2017-10-14,"Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of the digestive system has a dismal prognosis with limited treatment options. This study aimed to investigate expression of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in these tumors. Thirty-seven patients with a poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of the digestive system were identified. Their electronic medical records, pathology reports, and pathology slides were reviewed for demographics, clinical history, and pathologic features. Tumor sections were immunohistochemically labeled for PD-1 and PD-L1, and expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 on tumor and tumor-associated immune cells was analyzed and compared between small cell and large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas. The mean age of patients was 61 years old with 18 men and 19 women. The colorectum (n=20) was the most common primary site; other primary sites included the pancreaticobiliary system, esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and ampulla. Expression of PD-1 was detected on tumor cells (n=6, 16%) as well as on tumor-associated immune cells (n=23, 63%). The 6 cases with PD-1 expression on tumor cells also had the expression on immune cells. Expression of PD-L1 was visualized on tumor cells in 5 cases (14%) and on tumor-associated immune cells in 10 cases (27%). There was no difference in PD-1 and PD-L1 expression between small cell and large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas.

Health Reform and Utilization of High-Volume Hospitals for Complex Cancer Operations.,Journal of oncology practice,J Oncol Pract,2017-11-20,"Underinsured patients are less likely to receive complex cancer operations at hospitals with high surgical volumes (high-volume hospitals, or HVHs), which contributes to disparities in care. To date, the impact of insurance coverage expansion on site of complex cancer surgery remains unknown. Using the 2006 Massachusetts coverage expansion as a natural experiment, we searched the Hospital Cost and Utilization Project state inpatient databases for Massachusetts and control states (New York, New Jersey, and Florida) between 2001 and 2011 to evaluate changes in the utilization of HVHs for resections of bladder, esophageal, stomach, pancreatic, rectal, or lung cancer after the expansion of insurance coverage. We studied nonelderly, adult patients with private insurance and those with government-subsidized or self-pay (GSSP) coverage with a difference-in-differences framework. We studied 11,687 patients in Massachusetts and 56,300 patients in control states. Compared with control states, the 2006 Massachusetts insurance expansion was associated with a 14% increased rate of surgical intervention for GSSP patients (incident rate ratio, 1.14; P = .015), but there was no significant change in the probability of GSSP patients undergoing surgery at an HVH (1.0 percentage-point increase; P = .710).

A Novel YAP1 Inhibitor Targets CSC-Enriched Radiation-Resistant Cells and Exerts Strong Antitumor Activity in Esophageal Adenocarcinoma.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2017-11-22,"Mounting evidence suggests that the Hippo coactivator Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) is a major mediator of cancer stem cell (CSC) properties, tumor progression, and therapy resistance as well as often a terminal node of many oncogenic pathways. Thus, targeting YAP1 may be a novel therapeutic strategy for many types of tumors with high YAP1 expression, including esophageal adenocarcinoma. However, effective YAP1 inhibitors are currently lacking. Here, we identify a small molecule (CA3) that not only has remarkable inhibitory activity on YAP1/Tead transcriptional activity but also demonstrates strong inhibitory effects on esophageal adenocarcinoma cell growth especially on YAP1 high-expressing esophageal adenocarcinoma cells both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> Remarkably, radiation-resistant cells acquire strong cancer stem cell (CSC) properties and aggressive phenotype, while CA3 can effectively suppress these phenotypes by inhibiting proliferation, inducing apoptosis, reducing tumor sphere formation, and reducing the fraction of ALDH1<sup>+</sup> cells. Furthermore, CA3, combined with 5-FU, synergistically inhibits esophageal adenocarcinoma cell growth especially in YAP1 high esophageal adenocarcinoma cells. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that CA3 represents a new inhibitor of YAP1 and primarily targets YAP1 high and therapy-resistant esophageal adenocarcinoma cells endowed with CSC properties. <i>Mol Cancer Ther; 17(2); 443-54. ©2017 AACR</i>.",Journal Article,790.0,18.0,Mounting evidence suggests that the Hippo coactivator Yes-associated protein 1 YAP1 is a major mediator of cancer stem cell CSC properties tumor progression and therapy resistance as well as often a terminal node of many oncogenic pathways Thus targeting YAP1 may be a novel therapeutic strategy for many types of tumors with high YAP1 expression including adenocarcinoma However effective YAP1 inhibitors are currently lacking Here we identify a small molecule CA3 that not only has remarkable inhibitory activity on YAP1/Tead transcriptional activity but also demonstrates strong inhibitory effects on adenocarcinoma cell growth especially on YAP1 high-expressing adenocarcinoma cells both i in vitro /i and i in vivo /i Remarkably radiation-resistant cells acquire strong cancer stem cell CSC properties and aggressive phenotype while CA3 can effectively suppress these phenotypes by inhibiting proliferation inducing apoptosis reducing tumor sphere formation and reducing the fraction of ALDH1 sup /sup cells Furthermore CA3 combined with 5-FU synergistically inhibits adenocarcinoma cell growth especially in YAP1 high adenocarcinoma cells Taken together these findings demonstrated that CA3 represents a new inhibitor of YAP1 and primarily targets YAP1 high and therapy-resistant adenocarcinoma cells endowed with CSC properties i Mol Cancer Ther 17 2 443-54 ©2017 AACR /i,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[9183, 241, 844, 17, 3, 10934, 8777, 7073, 41, 178, 14, 6807, 16, 8, 458, 3810, 1, 12, 452, 31, 4234, 1571, 30, 91, 2, 36, 251, 22, 149, 22, 629, 8, 2158, 289, 1, 445, 1302, 460, 631, 529, 6807, 68, 40, 8, 229, 189, 692, 9, 445, 630, 1, 57, 5, 64, 6807, 55, 141, 449, 137, 323, 6807, 222, 32, 694, 1941, 467, 21, 255, 8, 302, 1354, 36507, 17, 44, 158, 71, 3813, 1810, 128, 23, 6807, 25619, 1431, 128, 84, 120, 1902, 1082, 1810, 176, 23, 449, 31, 129, 1093, 23, 6807, 64, 1046, 449, 37, 110, 70, 4, 439, 70, 2, 70, 4, 386, 70, 4856, 121, 436, 37, 6206, 1082, 12, 452, 31, 4234, 1571, 2, 571, 1005, 369, 36507, 122, 1856, 3134, 46, 2618, 20, 2062, 457, 1958, 351, 1818, 30, 8960, 1264, 2, 1818, 3, 1509, 1, 16122, 172, 172, 37, 798, 36507, 397, 5, 33, 1296, 4240, 1576, 449, 31, 129, 1093, 4, 6807, 64, 449, 37, 1633, 1162, 46, 272, 264, 17, 36507, 1449, 8, 217, 230, 1, 6807, 2, 1561, 637, 6807, 64, 2, 36, 436, 449, 37, 25033, 5, 4234, 1571, 70, 5824, 12, 7770, 269, 18, 10462, 667, 3194, 1630, 70]",1378.0,29167315,573

"Comparative study of lung and extrapulmonary poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas: A SEER database analysis of 162,983 cases.",Cancer,Cancer,2017-12-06,"Extrapulmonary neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) are poorly studied and are managed similar to lung NECs, which may not account for differences between the 2 groups of tumors as well as the heterogeneity within extrapulmonary NEC. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program between 1973 and 2012 were used to estimate the relative percentages of lung NECs and subgroups of extrapulmonary NECs, epidemiological patterns at these sites, and the median and 5-year overall survival rates. Of 162,983 NEC cases, 14,732 were extrapulmonary; of these, 5509 were gastrointestinal (37.44%), 4151 were of unknown primary (28.2%), and 5072 were of other sites (34.4%). Lung NEC had the highest percentage of small cell morphology (95.2%) and gastrointestinal NEC had the least (38.7%), with the rest being other morphologies. Significant differences were noted with regard to median age (range, 48-74 years), percentage of cases of distant stage disease (24%-77%), and incidence according to sex and race. The median survival of patients with lung NEC was 7.6 months, that for patients with gastrointestinal NEC was 7.5 months (range, 25.1 months for NEC at the small intestine to 5.7 months for NEC at the pancreas), and that for patients with unknown NEC was 2.5 months. The 5-year survival rate for patients with local stage disease ranged from 58% to 60% for NECs of the female genital tract and small intestine to 25% for esophageal NECs. The primary tumor site remained statistically significant for survival even after adjusting for known prognostic variables (P<.0001). To the authors' knowledge, the current study is the largest study of NECs performed to date and also the first with comprehensive epidemiological data.

Early Metabolic Change after Induction Chemotherapy Predicts Histologic Response and Prognosis in Patients with Esophageal Cancer: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Trial.,Targeted oncology,Target Oncol,2018-02-01,"Early metabolic response after preoperative induction chemotherapy (IC) appears to predict histologic response and prognosis in esophageal cancer (EC), but the usefulness of this approach needs further development. We evaluated metabolic response after one cycle of IC using positron emission tomography (PET) to correlate PET response and outcomes. We retrospectively analyzed PET data from a randomized phase 2 trial (NCT00525915) of chemoradiation and surgery with or without IC for the treatment of EC. PET was performed at baseline, after one cycle of IC, and 5-7 weeks after chemoradiation. The relationship between PET response (≥35% reduction in standardized uptake value [SUV]) after IC and treatment response was analyzed. In 63 patients who received IC, the mean initial SUV<sub>max</sub> prior to treatment was 11.9 ± 8.04 and mean SUV<sub>max</sub> after one cycle of IC was 6.47 ± 4.45. The mean SUV reduction after IC was 39.3%. Eleven of 37 PET responders achieved a pathologic complete response (pCR), but only two of 22 PET non-responders did (univariate logistic regression; odds ratio: 4.25, 95% confidence interval: 0.83-21.77; p = 0.08). PET responders to IC had significantly longer overall survival (OS) than PET nonresponders (log-rank p = 0.009). PET response after chemoradiation was not correlated with OS (log-rank p = 0.15). Early PET response after IC is prognostic, but subsequent PET changes (for example, after chemoradiation) are not prognostic. Early PET response might have the potential of predicting pCR.",Journal Article,719.0,2.0,Early metabolic response after preoperative induction chemotherapy IC appears to predict histologic response and prognosis in cancer EC but the usefulness of this approach needs further development We evaluated metabolic response after one cycle of IC using positron emission tomography PET to correlate PET response and outcomes We retrospectively analyzed PET data from a randomized phase 2 trial NCT00525915 of chemoradiation and surgery with or without IC for the treatment of EC PET was performed at baseline after one cycle of IC and 5-7 weeks after chemoradiation The relationship between PET response ≥35 reduction in standardized uptake value SUV after IC and treatment response was analyzed In 63 patients who received IC the mean initial SUV sub max /sub prior to treatment was 11.9 ± 8.04 and mean SUV sub max /sub after one cycle of IC was 6.47 ± 4.45 The mean SUV reduction after IC was 39.3 Eleven of 37 PET responders achieved a pathologic complete response pCR but only two of 22 PET non-responders did univariate logistic regression odds ratio 4.25 95 confidence interval 0.83-21.77 p 0.08 PET responders to IC had significantly longer overall survival OS than PET nonresponders log-rank p 0.009 PET response after chemoradiation was not correlated with OS log-rank p 0.15 Early PET response after IC is prognostic but subsequent PET changes for example after chemoradiation are not prognostic Early PET response might have the potential of predicting pCR,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[191, 1436, 51, 50, 498, 504, 56, 2340, 1233, 6, 678, 884, 51, 2, 356, 4, 12, 2180, 84, 3, 5235, 1, 26, 353, 1891, 195, 193, 21, 194, 1436, 51, 50, 104, 417, 1, 2340, 75, 1900, 1799, 872, 495, 6, 1513, 495, 51, 2, 123, 21, 894, 311, 495, 74, 29, 8, 384, 124, 18, 160, 71759, 1, 975, 2, 152, 5, 15, 187, 2340, 9, 3, 24, 1, 2180, 495, 10, 173, 28, 330, 50, 104, 417, 1, 2340, 2, 33, 67, 244, 50, 975, 3, 858, 59, 495, 51, 13709, 628, 4, 1670, 1135, 549, 2217, 50, 2340, 2, 24, 51, 10, 311, 4, 676, 7, 54, 103, 2340, 3, 313, 388, 2217, 551, 2649, 551, 324, 6, 24, 10, 175, 83, 810, 66, 755, 2, 313, 2217, 551, 2649, 551, 50, 104, 417, 1, 2340, 10, 49, 662, 810, 39, 512, 3, 313, 2217, 628, 50, 2340, 10, 587, 27, 2627, 1, 567, 495, 1983, 513, 8, 510, 236, 51, 604, 84, 158, 100, 1, 350, 495, 220, 1983, 205, 880, 812, 320, 610, 197, 39, 243, 48, 307, 268, 13, 852, 239, 849, 19, 13, 1592, 495, 1983, 6, 2340, 42, 97, 589, 63, 25, 118, 76, 495, 4498, 1066, 1026, 19, 13, 2376, 495, 51, 50, 975, 10, 44, 438, 5, 118, 1066, 1026, 19, 13, 167, 191, 495, 51, 50, 2340, 16, 177, 84, 706, 495, 400, 9, 2685, 50, 975, 32, 44, 177, 191, 495, 51, 822, 47, 3, 174, 1, 1434, 604]",1473.0,29218623,393
HER2 Confers Resistance to Foretinib Inhibition of MET-Amplified Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Cells.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2017-12-07,"Recent genomic studies indicated that esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is driven by amplification of c-MET or HER2 or both in a subset of patients. We studied the effect of MET targeting by the small molecule inhibitor foretinib in EAC cells and the interplay between MET and HER2 signaling. We measured the expression levels and phosphorylation status of MET and HER2 proteins in EAC cell lines using Western blot analysis. The expression levels of MET and HER2 were manipulated by transfecting cells with specific siRNA or a plasmid expressing HER2. The small molecule inhibitors of c-MET and ERBB1/2 (foretinib and lapatinib, respectively) were tested for effect on growth, apoptosis, and downstream signaling pathways of EAC cells as single agents or in combination. The response to inhibitors was correlated to the levels of MET, HER2 expression, and amplification status. Foretinib inhibits phosphorylation of MET, which correlated with reduced EAC cell growth and inhibition of AKT and ERK phosphorylation. Cell growth inhibition by foretinib is most profound in the ESO51 cell line, which has MET gene amplification and overexpression. Inhibition of MET signaling by foretinib or siRNA-specific knock down of MET expression induces apoptosis in ESO51 cells. Ectopic expression of HER2 reduces foretinib-mediated growth inhibition and downstream ERK phosphorylation in ESO51-HER2 cells. The EAC OE33 cell line, with amplification and overexpression of both MET and HER2, demonstrated reduced sensitivity to foretinib or lapatinib and had a transient effect on downstream inhibition of phosphorylated AKT and ERK (p-AKT, p-ERK). The coadministration of foretinib and lapatinib effectively blocked both MET and HER2 signaling through the p-AKT and p-ERK pathways, dramatically inhibited growth, and induced apoptosis to overcome single-agent resistance in OE33 cells. The mechanism for foretinib growth inhibition in MET-amplified EAC tumor cells is demonstrated. The interplay of dual MET/HER2 overexpression in the AKT and ERK pathways for esophageal cancer is described. Therefore, combination therapy could be a novel strategy for EAC with amplification of both MET and HER2.",Journal Article,775.0,4.0,Recent genomic studies indicated that adenocarcinoma EAC is driven by amplification of c-MET or HER2 or both in a subset of patients We studied the effect of MET targeting by the small molecule inhibitor foretinib in EAC cells and the interplay between MET and HER2 signaling We measured the expression levels and phosphorylation status of MET and HER2 proteins in EAC cell lines using Western blot analysis The expression levels of MET and HER2 were manipulated by transfecting cells with specific siRNA or a plasmid expressing HER2 The small molecule inhibitors of c-MET and ERBB1/2 foretinib and lapatinib respectively were tested for effect on growth apoptosis and downstream signaling pathways of EAC cells as single agents or in combination The response to inhibitors was correlated to the levels of MET HER2 expression and amplification status Foretinib inhibits phosphorylation of MET which correlated with reduced EAC cell growth and inhibition of AKT and ERK phosphorylation Cell growth inhibition by foretinib is most profound in the ESO51 cell line which has MET gene amplification and overexpression Inhibition of MET signaling by foretinib or siRNA-specific knock down of MET expression induces apoptosis in ESO51 cells Ectopic expression of HER2 reduces foretinib-mediated growth inhibition and downstream ERK phosphorylation in ESO51-HER2 cells The EAC OE33 cell line with amplification and overexpression of both MET and HER2 demonstrated reduced sensitivity to foretinib or lapatinib and had a transient effect on downstream inhibition of phosphorylated AKT and ERK p-AKT p-ERK The coadministration of foretinib and lapatinib effectively blocked both MET and HER2 signaling through the p-AKT and p-ERK pathways dramatically inhibited growth and induced apoptosis to overcome single-agent resistance in OE33 cells The mechanism for foretinib growth inhibition in MET-amplified EAC tumor cells is demonstrated The interplay of dual MET/HER2 overexpression in the AKT and ERK pathways for cancer is described Therefore combination therapy could be a novel strategy for EAC with amplification of both MET and HER2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[435, 572, 94, 1103, 17, 449, 3378, 16, 1621, 20, 1073, 1, 256, 543, 15, 354, 15, 110, 4, 8, 697, 1, 7, 21, 656, 3, 254, 1, 543, 529, 20, 3, 302, 1354, 230, 11707, 4, 3378, 37, 2, 3, 5709, 59, 543, 2, 354, 314, 21, 644, 3, 55, 148, 2, 982, 156, 1, 543, 2, 354, 652, 4, 3378, 31, 285, 75, 1521, 2639, 65, 3, 55, 148, 1, 543, 2, 354, 11, 13222, 20, 23384, 37, 5, 112, 1919, 15, 8, 6007, 1046, 354, 3, 302, 1354, 222, 1, 256, 543, 2, 9177, 18, 11707, 2, 2076, 106, 11, 650, 9, 254, 23, 129, 351, 2, 1489, 314, 460, 1, 3378, 37, 22, 226, 183, 15, 4, 150, 3, 51, 6, 222, 10, 438, 6, 3, 148, 1, 543, 354, 55, 2, 1073, 156, 11707, 1576, 982, 1, 543, 92, 438, 5, 405, 3378, 31, 129, 2, 297, 1, 649, 2, 1819, 982, 31, 129, 297, 20, 11707, 16, 96, 4399, 4, 3, 32717, 31, 328, 92, 71, 543, 145, 1073, 2, 851, 297, 1, 543, 314, 20, 11707, 15, 1919, 112, 6252, 1328, 1, 543, 55, 1516, 351, 4, 32717, 37, 3647, 55, 1, 354, 2389, 11707, 517, 129, 297, 2, 1489, 1819, 982, 4, 32717, 354, 37, 3, 3378, 24039, 31, 328, 5, 1073, 2, 851, 1, 110, 543, 2, 354, 264, 405, 485, 6, 11707, 15, 2076, 2, 42, 8, 2473, 254, 23, 1489, 297, 1, 2365, 649, 2, 1819, 19, 649, 19, 1819, 3, 5777, 1, 11707, 2, 2076, 1856, 2582, 110, 543, 2, 354, 314, 298, 3, 19, 649, 2, 19, 1819, 460, 2729, 879, 129, 2, 277, 351, 6, 1768, 226, 420, 251, 4, 24039, 37, 3, 670, 9, 11707, 129, 297, 4, 543, 2429, 3378, 30, 37, 16, 264, 3, 5709, 1, 1828, 543, 354, 851, 4, 3, 649, 2, 1819, 460, 9, 12, 16, 1027, 673, 150, 36, 359, 40, 8, 229, 692, 9, 3378, 5, 1073, 1, 110, 543, 2, 354]",2127.0,29223420,47
Genome-wide Discovery of a Novel Gene-expression Signature for the Identification of Lymph Node Metastasis in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2019-05-01,"This study aimed to develop a gene-expression signature for identification of lymph node (LN) metastasis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients. LN metastasis is recognized as the most important independent risk factor for therapeutic decision-making of ESCC patients. A bioinformatic approach was used to analyze RNA sequencing profiles of ESCC patients, and to develop a gene-expression signature for identifying LN metastasis. The robustness of this panel was assessed in 2 independent patient cohorts (n = 56 and 224). We initially prioritized a 16-gene signature out of the total 20,531 mRNAs. The model estimated by these 16 genes discriminated LN status with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.77 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.68-0.87, 5-fold cross-validation].

Epigenetic biomarkers in gastrointestinal cancers: The current state and clinical perspectives.,Seminars in cancer biology,Semin. Cancer Biol.,2017-12-15,"Each year, almost 4.1 million people are diagnosed with gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. Due to late detection of this disease, the mortality is high, causing approximately 3 million cancer-related deaths annually, worldwide. Although the incidence and survival differs according to organ site, earlier detection and improved prognostication have the potential to reduce overall mortality burden from these cancers. Epigenetic changes, including aberrant promoter DNA methylation, are common events in both cancer initiation and progression. Furthermore, such changes may be identified non-invasively with the use of PCR based methods, in bodily fluids of cancer patients. These features make aberrant DNA methylation a promising substrate for the development of disease biomarkers for early detection, prognosis and for predicting response to therapy. In this article, we will provide an update and current clinical perspectives for DNA methylation alterations in patients with colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, liver and esophageal cancers, and discuss their potential role as cancer biomarkers.",Journal Article,767.0,9.0,Each year almost 4.1 million people are diagnosed with GI cancers Due to late detection of this disease the mortality is high causing approximately 3 million cancer-related deaths annually worldwide Although the incidence and survival differs according to organ site earlier detection and improved prognostication have the potential to reduce overall mortality burden from these cancers Epigenetic changes including aberrant promoter DNA methylation are common events in both cancer initiation and progression Furthermore such changes may be identified non-invasively with the use of PCR based methods in bodily fluids of cancer patients These features make aberrant DNA methylation a promising substrate for the development of disease biomarkers for early detection prognosis and for predicting response to therapy In this article we will provide an update and current clinical perspectives for DNA methylation alterations in patients with and cancers and discuss their potential role as cancer biomarkers,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[296, 111, 2214, 39, 14, 3346, 3788, 32, 265, 5, 2104, 163, 520, 6, 807, 638, 1, 26, 34, 3, 282, 16, 64, 3440, 705, 27, 3346, 12, 139, 1043, 4226, 2358, 242, 3, 287, 2, 25, 4990, 768, 6, 1259, 606, 1677, 638, 2, 231, 4260, 47, 3, 174, 6, 969, 63, 282, 892, 29, 46, 163, 1418, 400, 141, 1898, 973, 261, 569, 32, 186, 281, 4, 110, 12, 1118, 2, 91, 798, 225, 400, 68, 40, 108, 220, 15037, 5, 3, 119, 1, 604, 90, 636, 4, 17183, 9332, 1, 12, 7, 46, 404, 2378, 1898, 261, 569, 8, 721, 4235, 9, 3, 193, 1, 34, 582, 9, 191, 638, 356, 2, 9, 1434, 51, 6, 36, 4, 26, 946, 21, 303, 377, 35, 2991, 2, 291, 38, 5856, 9, 261, 569, 593, 4, 7, 5, 2, 163, 2, 1139, 136, 174, 200, 22, 12, 582]",1006.0,29253542,39

We developed and validated a model to determine of progression to HGD or EAC in patients with BE, based on demographic data and endoscopic and histologic findings at the time of index endoscopy. We performed a longitudinal study of patients with BE at 5 centers in United States and 1 center in Netherlands enrolled in the Barrett's Esophagus Study database from 1985 through 2014. Patients were excluded from the analysis if they had less than 1 year of follow-up, were diagnosed with HGD or EAC within the past year, were missing baseline histologic data, or had no intestinal metaplasia. Seventy percent of the patients were used to derive the model and 30% were used for the validation study. The primary outcome was development of HGD or EAC during the follow-up period (median, 5.9 years). Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. We assigned a specific number of points to each BE risk factor, and point totals (scores) were used to create categories of low, intermediate, and high risk. We used Cox regression to compute hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals to determine associations between risk of progression and scores. Of 4584 patients in the database, 2697 were included in our analysis (84.1% men; 87.6% Caucasian; mean age, 55.4 ± 20.1 years; mean body mass index, 27.9 ± 5.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; mean length of BE, 3.7 ± 3.2 cm). During the follow-up period, 154 patients (5.7%) developed HGD or EAC, with an annual rate of progression of 0.95%. Male sex, smoking, length of BE, and baseline-confirmed low-grade dysplasia were significantly associated with progression. Scores assigned identified patients with BE that progressed to HGD or EAC with a c-statistic of 0.76 (95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.80; P < .001). The calibration slope was 0.9966 (P = .99), determined from the validation cohort. We developed a scoring system (Progression in Barrett's Esophagus score) based on male sex, smoking, length of BE, and baseline low-grade dysplasia that identified patients with BE at low, intermediate, and high risk for HGD or EAC.

"Comparative Outcomes After Definitive Chemoradiotherapy Using Proton Beam Therapy Versus Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy for Esophageal Cancer: A Retrospective, Single-Institutional Analysis.","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2017-06-27,"To compare clinical outcomes between proton beam therapy (PBT) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in patients with esophageal cancer (EC) treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT). From 2007 through 2014, 343 EC patients who received definitive CRT with either PBT (n=132) or IMRT (n=211) were retrospectively analyzed. Survival, recurrence, and treatment toxicity were compared between groups. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was performed to test the association between patient/treatment variables and survival. Patient/treatment variables were overall well balanced, except for age and race. Compared with IMRT, PBT had significantly better overall survival (OS; P=.011), progression-free survival (PFS; P=.001), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS; P=.031), as well as marginally better locoregional failure-free survival (LRFFS; P=.075).

Pilot study of serial FLT and FDG-PET/CT imaging to monitor response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy of esophageal adenocarcinoma: correlation with histopathologic response.,Annals of nuclear medicine,Ann Nucl Med,2018-01-13,"The aim of this prospective pilot study was to investigate the potential of serial FLT-PET/CT compared to FDG-PET/CT to provide an early indication of esophageal cancer response to concurrent neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy. Five patients with biopsy-proven esophageal adenocarcinomas underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation (Tx) prior to minimally invasive esophagectomy. The presence of residual tumor was classified histologically using the Mandard et al. criteria, categorizing patients as pathologic responders and non-responders. Participants underwent PET/CT imaging 1 h after intravenous administration of FDG and of FLT on two separate days within 48 h of each other. Each patient underwent a total of 3 scan ""pairs"": (1) pre-treatment, (2) during treatment, and (3) post-treatment. Image-based response to therapy was measured in terms of changes in SUVmax (ΔSUV) between pre- and post-therapeutic FLT- and FDG-PET scans. The PET imaging findings were correlated with the pathology results after surgery. All tumors were FDG and FLT avid at baseline. Lesion FLT uptake was lower than with FDG. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation resulted in a reduction of tumor uptake of both radiotracers in pathological responders (n = 3) and non-responders (n = 2). While the difference in the reduction in mean tumor FLT uptake during Tx between responders (ΔSUV = - 55%) and non-responders (ΔSUV = - 29%) was significant (P = 0.007), for FDG it was not, [responders had a mean ΔSUV = - 39 vs. - 31% for non-responders (P = 0.74)]. The difference in the reduction in tumor FLT uptake at the end of treatment between responders (ΔSUV = - 62%) and non-responders (ΔSUV = - 57%) was not significant (P = 0.54), while for FDG there was a trend toward significance [ΔSUV of responders = - 74 vs. - 52% in non-responders (P = 0.06)]. The results of this prospective pilot study suggest that early changes in tumor FLT uptake may be better than FDG in predicting response of esophageal adenocarcinomas to neoadjuvant chemoradiation. These preliminary results support the need to corroborate the value of FLT-PET/CT in a larger cohort.",Comparative Study,738.0,3.0,The aim of this prospective pilot study was to investigate the potential of serial FLT-PET/CT compared to FDG-PET/CT to provide an early indication of cancer response to concurrent neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy Five patients with biopsy-proven adenocarcinomas underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation Tx prior to minimally invasive esophagectomy The presence of residual tumor was classified histologically using the Mandard et al criteria categorizing patients as pathologic responders and non-responders Participants underwent PET/CT imaging 1 h after intravenous administration of FDG and of FLT on two separate days within 48 h of each other Each patient underwent a total of 3 scan `` pairs '' 1 pre-treatment 2 during treatment and 3 post-treatment Image-based response to therapy was measured in terms of changes in SUVmax ΔSUV between pre- and post-therapeutic FLT- and FDG-PET scans The PET imaging findings were correlated with the pathology results after surgery All tumors were FDG and FLT avid at baseline Lesion FLT uptake was lower than with FDG Neoadjuvant chemoradiation resulted in a reduction of tumor uptake of both radiotracers in pathological responders n 3 and non-responders n 2 While the difference in the reduction in mean tumor FLT uptake during Tx between responders ΔSUV 55 and non-responders ΔSUV 29 was significant P 0.007 for FDG it was not responders had a mean ΔSUV 39 vs. 31 for non-responders P 0.74 The difference in the reduction in tumor FLT uptake at the end of treatment between responders ΔSUV 62 and non-responders ΔSUV 57 was not significant P 0.54 while for FDG there was a trend toward significance ΔSUV of responders 74 vs. 52 in non-responders P 0.06 The results of this prospective pilot study suggest that early changes in tumor FLT uptake may be better than FDG in predicting response of adenocarcinomas to neoadjuvant chemoradiation These preliminary results support the need to corroborate the value of FLT-PET/CT in a larger cohort,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[3, 1130, 1, 26, 482, 2281, 45, 10, 6, 963, 3, 174, 1, 2108, 4368, 495, 425, 72, 6, 1285, 495, 425, 6, 377, 35, 191, 3607, 1, 12, 51, 6, 750, 536, 975, 36, 365, 7, 5, 411, 1930, 1586, 208, 536, 975, 6614, 324, 6, 2144, 416, 3617, 3, 463, 1, 753, 30, 10, 1373, 2161, 75, 3, 26711, 2022, 2171, 371, 17722, 7, 22, 510, 1983, 2, 220, 1983, 776, 208, 495, 425, 270, 14, 555, 50, 1262, 634, 1, 1285, 2, 1, 4368, 23, 100, 2282, 162, 262, 576, 555, 1, 296, 127, 296, 69, 208, 8, 181, 1, 27, 1657, 2773, 522, 14, 671, 24, 18, 190, 24, 2, 27, 539, 24, 1482, 90, 51, 6, 36, 10, 644, 4, 1794, 1, 400, 4, 4996, 24224, 59, 671, 2, 539, 189, 4368, 2, 1285, 495, 1441, 3, 495, 270, 272, 11, 438, 5, 3, 1117, 99, 50, 152, 62, 57, 11, 1285, 2, 4368, 5189, 28, 330, 1180, 4368, 1135, 10, 280, 76, 5, 1285, 536, 975, 627, 4, 8, 628, 1, 30, 1135, 1, 110, 13626, 4, 1301, 1983, 78, 27, 2, 220, 1983, 78, 18, 369, 3, 523, 4, 3, 628, 4, 313, 30, 4368, 1135, 190, 6614, 59, 1983, 24224, 614, 2, 220, 1983, 24224, 462, 10, 93, 19, 13, 1999, 9, 1285, 192, 10, 44, 1983, 42, 8, 313, 24224, 587, 105, 456, 9, 220, 1983, 19, 13, 794, 3, 523, 4, 3, 628, 4, 30, 4368, 1135, 28, 3, 396, 1, 24, 59, 1983, 24224, 744, 2, 220, 1983, 24224, 696, 10, 44, 93, 19, 13, 667, 369, 9, 1285, 125, 10, 8, 853, 1317, 724, 24224, 1, 1983, 794, 105, 653, 4, 220, 1983, 19, 13, 1460, 3, 99, 1, 26, 482, 2281, 45, 309, 17, 191, 400, 4, 30, 4368, 1135, 68, 40, 380, 76, 1285, 4, 1434, 51, 1, 1586, 6, 536, 975, 46, 1676, 99, 538, 3, 594, 6, 14855, 3, 549, 1, 4368, 495, 425, 4, 8, 1077, 180]",1986.0,29332233,443
Multi-institutional Analysis of Recurrence and Survival After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy of Esophageal Cancer: Impact of Histology on Recurrence Patterns and Outcomes.,Annals of surgery,Ann.

There is a paucity of data regarding comparative outcomes after neoadjuvant CRT between esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma. Between 2002 and 2015, 895 EC patients who underwent neoadjuvant CRT followed by esophagectomy at 3 academic institutions were retrospectively reviewed, including 207 patients with SCC (23.1%) and 688 patients with adenocarcinoma (76.9%). Pathologic response, survival, recurrence pattern, and potential prognostic factors were compared. Pathologic complete response (pCR) rate was significantly higher for SCC compared with adenocarcinoma (44.9% vs 25.9%, P < 0.001). After a median follow-up of 52.9 months, 71 patients (34.3%) with SCC versus 297 patients (43.2%) with adenocarcinoma had recurrent disease (P = 0.023). For patients who achieved a pCR, no significant differences were found in recurrence pattern, sites, or survival end-points between the 2 histology groups. For non-pCR patients, the SCC group demonstrated significantly higher regional and supraclavicular recurrence rates but a lower hematogenous metastasis rate than adenocarcinoma patients, whereas the adenocarcinoma patients had a more favorable locoregional failure-free survival (P = 0.005) and worse distant metastasis-free survival (P = 0.024). No differences were found in overall survival (P = 0.772) or recurrence-free survival (P = 0.696) between groups. SCC was associated with a significantly higher pCR rate than adenocarcinoma.

The Role of Surgery in Treating Resectable Limited Disease of Esophageal Neuroendocrine Carcinoma.,World journal of surgery,World J Surg,2018-08-01,"Esophageal neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is a rare malignant tumor. The role of surgery in resectable limited disease of esophageal NEC remains unclear. How to select a specific group of limited disease of esophageal NEC who might benefit from surgery remains to be answered. Patients undergoing esophagectomy for resectable limited disease of esophageal NEC in our department from January 2007 to June 2015 were analyzed. TNM staging system was applied to describe those patients, and according to their different long-term prognosis after surgery, those patients were subgrouped into surgery response limited disease (SRLD) group and surgery non-response limited disease (SNRLD) group. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were applied to identify potential prognostic factors. A total of 72 patients with resectable limited disease of esophageal NEC were identified for analysis. The median survival time of those patients was 21.5 months. There was no significant survival differences among stage I, stage IIA, and stage IIB patients, but all these patients had significantly longer survival than stage III patients. Therefore, stage I, stage IIA, and stage IIB patients were aggregated together as SRLD group, and stage III patients were aggregated as SNRLD group. SRLD patients obtained significantly longer survival than SNRLD patients in both univariate analysis and multivariate analysis.

RAP80 is an independent prognosis biomarker for the outcome of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,Cell death & disease,Cell Death Dis,2018-02-02,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the most popular pathology of esophageal cancer (EC) in China, especially in Henan province, mid-east of China. Presently, targeting DNA damage repair (DDR) factors is a promising approach for cancer therapy. Our group has been focusing on exploring the DDR factors overexpressed in ESCC tissues to provide potential targets for therapies for many years. RAP80/UIMC1 (ubiquitin interaction motif containing 1), one of those DDR factors we tested, was highly overexpressed in ESCC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Moreover, the RAP80 mRNA level was validated to be an independent prognosis biomarker for the overall survival time of ESCC patients. The following biological assays revealed that it promoted cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, inhibited cell apoptosis at both early and late stages, and participated in G2/M checkpoint regulation. Even though studies have reported that ATM phosphorylates RAP80 at different serine sites upon DNA damage, the reversal regulation of RAP80 on the activity of ATM has never been investigated. In the study, mechanism explorations revealed that RAP80 positively regulated the ATM activity via proteasome-ubiquitination pathway to promote the transition of G2/M phase in cell cycle. By examining a number of E3 ubiquitination ligases (Ub) and deubiquitination (DUb) enzymes, we found that RAP80 positively regulated the stability of USP13 to promote cell proliferation of EC cells. Moreover, inhibition of RAP80 greatly sensitized EC cells to ATM inhibitor KU-55933, triggering a potential combination of RAP80 inhibitors and ATM inhibitors to enhance the therapeutic efficiency of ESCC patients for the clinicians.",Journal Article,718.0,4.0,squamous cell carcinoma ESCC is the most popular pathology of cancer EC in China especially in Henan province mid-east of China Presently targeting DNA damage repair DDR factors is a promising approach for cancer therapy Our group has been focusing on exploring the DDR factors overexpressed in ESCC tissues to provide potential targets for therapies for many years RAP80/UIMC1 ubiquitin interaction motif containing 1 one of those DDR factors we tested was highly overexpressed in ESCC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues Moreover the RAP80 mRNA level was validated to be an independent prognosis biomarker for the overall survival time of ESCC patients The following biological assays revealed that it promoted cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo inhibited cell apoptosis at both early and late stages and participated in G2/M checkpoint regulation Even though studies have reported that ATM phosphorylates RAP80 at different serine sites upon DNA damage the reversal regulation of RAP80 on the activity of ATM has never been investigated In the study mechanism explorations revealed that RAP80 positively regulated the ATM activity via proteasome-ubiquitination pathway to promote the transition of G2/M phase in cell cycle By examining a number of E3 ubiquitination ligases Ub and deubiquitination DUb enzymes we found that RAP80 positively regulated the stability of USP13 to promote cell proliferation of EC cells Moreover inhibition of RAP80 greatly sensitized EC cells to ATM inhibitor KU-55933 triggering a potential combination of RAP80 inhibitors and ATM inhibitors to enhance the therapeutic efficiency of ESCC patients for the clinicians,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[691, 31, 134, 5681, 16, 3, 96, 8298, 1117, 1, 12, 2180, 4, 5055, 1093, 4, 72091, 20174, 4863, 6633, 1, 5055, 9083, 529, 261, 1350, 972, 5630, 130, 16, 8, 721, 353, 9, 12, 36, 114, 87, 71, 85, 3312, 23, 4378, 3, 5630, 130, 1711, 4, 5681, 742, 6, 377, 174, 637, 9, 235, 9, 445, 60, 22682, 72092, 4213, 915, 5298, 1101, 14, 104, 1, 135, 5630, 130, 21, 650, 10, 561, 1711, 4, 5681, 742, 72, 5, 2086, 295, 742, 1393, 3, 22682, 956, 301, 10, 938, 6, 40, 35, 306, 356, 901, 9, 3, 63, 25, 98, 1, 5681, 7, 3, 366, 1037, 1013, 553, 17, 192, 2992, 31, 457, 110, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 879, 31, 351, 28, 110, 191, 2, 807, 1153, 2, 3025, 4, 3774, 188, 986, 863, 871, 2471, 94, 47, 210, 17, 3552, 12528, 22682, 28, 338, 3734, 633, 1548, 261, 1350, 3, 5933, 863, 1, 22682, 23, 3, 128, 1, 3552, 71, 1737, 85, 565, 4, 3, 45, 670, 19063, 553, 17, 22682, 2375, 1065, 3, 3552, 128, 847, 1694, 8258, 308, 6, 1617, 3, 1970, 1, 3774, 188, 124, 4, 31, 417, 20, 3282, 8, 207, 1, 7193, 8258, 16192, 9904, 2, 40674, 29555, 3039, 21, 204, 17, 22682, 2375, 1065, 3, 2769, 1, 32686, 6, 1617, 31, 457, 1, 2180, 37, 1393, 297, 1, 22682, 3510, 4242, 2180, 37, 6, 3552, 230, 14188, 72093, 8867, 8, 174, 150, 1, 22682, 222, 2, 3552, 222, 6, 1304, 3, 189, 2904, 1, 5681, 7, 9, 3, 1490]",1669.0,29396516,641

Our aim was to study socioeconomic and racial differences in cancer surgery at Commission on Cancer (CoC)-accredited high-volume hospitals. The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was used to identify patients undergoing surgery for colon, esophageal, liver, and pancreatic cancer from 2003 to 2012. Annual hospital volume for each cancer was categorized using quartiles of patient volume. Patient-level predictors of surgery at a high-volume hospital, trends in the use of a high-volume hospital, and adjusted likelihood of surgery at a high-volume hospital in 2012 versus 2003 were analyzed. African American patients were less likely to undergo surgery at a high-volume hospital for esophageal (odds ratio [OR] 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49-0.73) and pancreatic cancer (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74-0.92), while uninsured patients and those residing in low educational attainment zip codes were less likely to undergo surgery at a high-volume hospital for esophageal, liver, and pancreatic cancer. In 2012, African Americans, uninsured patients, and those from low educational attainment zip codes were no more likely to undergo surgery at a high-volume hospital than in 2003 for any cancer type. These differences were not seen in colon cancer patients, for whom significant regionalization was not seen.

Eighth Edition Staging of Thoracic Malignancies: Implications for the Reporting Pathologist.,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med.,2018-02-26,"Context The Staging and Prognostic Factors Committee of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, in conjunction with the International Mesothelioma Interest Group, the International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group, and the Worldwide Esophageal Cancer Collaboration, developed proposals for the 8th edition of their respective tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging classification systems. Objective To review these changes and discuss issues for the reporting pathologist. Data Sources Proposals were based on international databases of lung (N = 94 708), with an external validation using the US National Cancer Database; mesothelioma (N = 3519); thymic epithelial tumors (10 808); and epithelial cancers of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction (N = 22 654). Conclusions These proposals have been mostly accepted by the Union for International Cancer Control and the American Joint Committee on Cancer and incorporated into their respective staging manuals (2017).

Inhibition of PC4 radiosensitizes non-small cell lung cancer by transcriptionally suppressing XLF.,Cancer medicine,Cancer Med,2018-03-09,"Positive cofactor 4 (PC4) participates in DNA damage repair and involved in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). Our previous results demonstrated that knockdown of PC4 downregulated the expression of XRCC4-like factor (XLF) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. However, the mechanism how PC4 regulates the expression of XLF remains unclear. Here, we found that knockdown of PC4 increased radiosensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we found that PC4 knockdown downregulated the expression of XLF, whereas recovering XLF expression restored radioresistance in the PC4-knockdown NSCLC cells. In addition, PC4 knockdown inhibited XLF expression by transcriptionally suppressing of XLF. Moreover, PC4 expression correlated with radiosensitivity and was an independent prognostic factor of progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with NSCLC.

Definitive chemoradiotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery for stage II to III esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg.,2018-02-15,"Definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) remains the most commonly used treatment for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), because of perceptions that esophagectomy offers an unclear survival advantage. We compare recurrence, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients treated with definitive CRT or neoadjuvant CRT followed by surgery (trimodality). This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with stage II and III SCC of the middle and distal esophagus in patients who completed CRT. Treatment groups were matched (1:1) on covariates using a propensity score-matching approach. The effect of trimodality treatment, compared with definitive CRT, on OS, DFS, and site-specific recurrence was evaluated as a time-dependent variable and analyzed using Cox regression with a gamma frailty term for matched units. We included 232 patients treated between 2000 and 2016: 124 (53%) with definitive CRT and 108 (47%) with trimodality. Trimodality was used less frequently over time (61% before 2009 and 29% after 2009; P < .0001). After matching, each group contained 56 patients. Median OS and DFS were 3.1 and 1.8 years for trimodality versus 2.3 and 1.0 years for CRT. Surgery was independently associated with improved OS (hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.97; P = .039) and DFS (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.83; P = .007).

Impact of Spot Size and Spacing on the Quality of Robustly Optimized Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy Plans for Lung Cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2018-02-14,"To investigate how spot size and spacing affect plan quality, robustness, and interplay effects of robustly optimized intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for lung cancer. Two robustly optimized IMPT plans were created for 10 lung cancer patients: first by a large-spot machine with in-air energy-dependent large spot size at isocenter (σ: 6-15 mm) and spacing (1.3 σ), and second by a small-spot machine with in-air energy-dependent small spot size (σ: 2-6 mm) and spacing (5 mm). Both plans were generated by optimizing radiation dose to internal target volume on averaged 4-dimensional computed tomography scans using an in-house-developed IMPT planning system. The dose-volume histograms band method was used to evaluate plan robustness. Dose evaluation software was developed to model time-dependent spot delivery to incorporate interplay effects with randomized starting phases for each field per fraction. Patient anatomy voxels were mapped phase-to-phase via deformable image registration, and doses were scored using in-house-developed software. Dose-volume histogram indices, including internal target volume dose coverage, homogeneity, and organs at risk (OARs) sparing, were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Compared with the large-spot machine, the small-spot machine resulted in significantly lower heart and esophagus mean doses, with comparable target dose coverage, homogeneity, and protection of other OARs. Plan robustness was comparable for targets and most OARs. With interplay effects considered, significantly lower heart and esophagus mean doses with comparable target dose coverage and homogeneity were observed using smaller spots. Robust optimization with a small spot-machine significantly improves heart and esophagus sparing, with comparable plan robustness and interplay effects compared with robust optimization with a large-spot machine. A small-spot machine uses a larger number of spots to cover the same tumors compared with a large-spot machine, which gives the planning system more freedom to compensate for the higher sensitivity to uncertainties and interplay effects for lung cancer treatments.",Journal Article,706.0,9.0,To investigate how spot size and spacing affect plan quality robustness and interplay effects of robustly optimized intensity modulated proton therapy IMPT for cancer Two robustly optimized IMPT plans were created for 10 cancer patients first by a large-spot machine with in-air energy-dependent large spot size at isocenter σ 6-15 mm and spacing 1.3 σ and second by a small-spot machine with in-air energy-dependent small spot size σ 2-6 mm and spacing 5 mm Both plans were generated by optimizing radiation dose to internal target volume on averaged 4-dimensional computed tomography scans using an in-house-developed IMPT planning system The dose-volume histograms band method was used to evaluate plan robustness Dose evaluation software was developed to model time-dependent spot delivery to incorporate interplay effects with randomized starting phases for each field per fraction Patient anatomy voxels were mapped phase-to-phase via deformable image registration and doses were scored using in-house-developed software Dose-volume histogram indices including internal target volume dose coverage homogeneity and organs at risk OARs sparing were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test Compared with the large-spot machine the small-spot machine resulted in significantly lower and mean doses with comparable target dose coverage homogeneity and protection of other OARs Plan robustness was comparable for targets and most OARs With interplay effects considered significantly lower and mean doses with comparable target dose coverage and homogeneity were observed using smaller spots Robust optimization with a small spot-machine significantly improves and sparing with comparable plan robustness and interplay effects compared with robust optimization with a large-spot machine A small-spot machine uses a larger number of spots to cover the same tumors compared with a large-spot machine which gives the planning system more freedom to compensate for the higher sensitivity to uncertainties and interplay effects for cancer treatments,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,"[6, 963, 832, 6901, 444, 2, 16076, 1158, 2242, 372, 7031, 2, 5709, 176, 1, 8547, 4039, 837, 1757, 2095, 36, 5534, 9, 12, 100, 8547, 4039, 5534, 1853, 11, 2466, 9, 79, 12, 7, 157, 20, 8, 375, 6901, 6555, 5, 4, 6909, 2803, 470, 375, 6901, 444, 28, 10578, 20086, 49, 167, 321, 2, 16076, 14, 27, 20086, 2, 419, 20, 8, 302, 6901, 6555, 5, 4, 6909, 2803, 470, 302, 6901, 444, 20086, 18, 49, 321, 2, 16076, 33, 321, 110, 1853, 11, 1419, 20, 4336, 121, 61, 6, 2329, 283, 433, 23, 6893, 39, 2201, 1220, 872, 1441, 75, 35, 4, 10087, 276, 5534, 1349, 398, 3, 61, 433, 8638, 7679, 596, 10, 95, 6, 376, 2242, 7031, 61, 451, 3639, 10, 276, 6, 202, 98, 470, 6901, 989, 6, 3360, 5709, 176, 5, 384, 1723, 3523, 9, 296, 1067, 379, 1509, 69, 5081, 8784, 11, 6224, 124, 6, 124, 847, 10491, 1482, 3169, 2, 415, 11, 3179, 75, 4, 10087, 276, 3639, 61, 433, 8261, 3824, 141, 2329, 283, 433, 61, 2139, 7502, 2, 2285, 28, 43, 8617, 1851, 11, 72, 75, 3, 3896, 7717, 1026, 412, 72, 5, 3, 375, 6901, 6555, 3, 302, 6901, 6555, 627, 4, 97, 280, 2, 313, 415, 5, 1279, 283, 61, 2139, 7502, 2, 3525, 1, 127, 8617, 2242, 7031, 10, 1279, 9, 637, 2, 96, 8617, 5, 5709, 176, 515, 97, 280, 2, 313, 415, 5, 1279, 283, 61, 2139, 2, 7502, 11, 164, 75, 2170, 8382, 1922, 3980, 5, 8, 302, 6901, 6555, 97, 1804, 2, 1851, 5, 1279, 2242, 7031, 2, 5709, 176, 72, 5, 1922, 3980, 5, 8, 375, 6901, 6555, 8, 302, 6901, 6555, 4025, 8, 1077, 207, 1, 8382, 6, 8308, 3, 827, 57, 72, 5, 8, 375, 6901, 6555, 92, 7989, 3, 1349, 398, 80, 3060, 6, 13748, 9, 3, 142, 485, 6, 7387, 2, 5709, 176, 9, 12, 640]",2048.0,29550033,237

Cancer incidence and mortality patterns in Luwan district of Shanghai during 2002-2011.,Drug discoveries & therapeutics,Drug Discov Ther,2018-04-22,"Cancer has become the leading cause of death and a major burden to public health in China. The current study analyzed the composition, incidence, mortality, and temporal trends for some major cancer types among permanent residents in Luwan district of Shanghai from 2002 to 2011, so as to provide data for cancer research. Data were collected from the database of cancer registration and management system in Shanghai. Number of new cases, number of deaths, incidence, and mortality of each cancer type were calculated. The incidence and mortality rates were standardized. Temporal trends in the incidence and mortality were assessed using average annual percent change. There were 12,843 new cancer cases and 8,331 deaths from cancer in Luwan from January 2002 to December 2011. Age-standardized incidence rates by Segi's standard were 229.46 and 205.05 per 100,000 population for males and females, respectively. For males, the most commonly diagnosed cancers were lung, colorectal, stomach, liver, prostate, bladder, pancreas, kidney, lymphoma, and esophageal cancers; for females, they were breast, colorectal, lung, stomach, thyroid, liver, ovary, pancreas, uterus, and brain cancers. The incidence rates for all cancers combined increased significantly for both males and females from 2002 to 2011 (p < 0.05 for both). Age-standardized mortality rates were 147.04 and 90.62 per 100,000 population for males and females, respectively. The mortality rates have stayed stable during the 10-year period for both males and females (p > 0.05 for both). Our results suggest that cancer incidence and mortality rates in Luwan district of Shanghai vary by age, sex, tumor type.

Actionable Locoregional Relapses after Therapy of Localized Esophageal Cancer: Insights from a Large Cohort.,Oncology,Oncology,2018-04-27,"The goal of surveillance after therapy of localized esophageal cancer (LEC) is to identify actionable relapses amenable to salvage; however, the current surveillance algorithms are not optimized. We report on a large cohort of LEC patients with actionable locoregional relapses (LRRs). Between 2000 and 2013, 127 (denominator = 752) patients with actionable LRR were identified. Histologic/cytologic confirmation was the gold standard. All surveillance tools (imaging, endoscopy, fine needle aspiration) were assessed. Most patients were men (89%), had adenocarcinoma (79%), and had no new symptoms (72%) when diagnosed with LRR. In trimodality patients, endoscopic confirmation of positron emission tomography-computed tomography-suspected LRR occurred in only 44%, and 56% required additional tools (e.g., fine needle aspiration). Alternatively, in bimodality patients, endoscopy confirmed LRRs in 81%. Trimodality patients had a higher risk of subsequent LRR/distant metastases after the first LRR than the bimodality patients (p = 0.03). In all patients, 78% of the subsequent relapses were distant. For patients who were salvaged, survival was significantly prolonged (50.6 vs. 25.1 months, p < 0.01). Patients live longer after successful salvage of the LRR than if salvage is not possible. After LRR, patients have a high risk of subsequent distant metastasis and whether the second relapse is local or distant, survival is uniformly poor.",Journal Article,634.0,0.0,The goal of surveillance after therapy of localized cancer LEC is to identify actionable relapses amenable to salvage however the current surveillance algorithms are not optimized We report on a large cohort of LEC patients with actionable locoregional relapses LRRs Between 2000 and 2013 127 denominator 752 patients with actionable LRR were identified Histologic/cytologic confirmation was the gold standard All surveillance tools imaging endoscopy fine needle aspiration were assessed Most patients were men 89 had adenocarcinoma 79 and had no new symptoms 72 when diagnosed with LRR In trimodality patients endoscopic confirmation of positron emission tomography-computed tomography-suspected LRR occurred in only 44 and 56 required additional tools e.g. fine needle aspiration Alternatively in bimodality patients endoscopy confirmed LRRs in 81 Trimodality patients had a higher risk of subsequent LRR/distant metastases after the first LRR than the bimodality patients p 0.03 In all patients 78 of the subsequent relapses were distant For patients who were salvaged survival was significantly prolonged 50.6 vs. 25.1 months p 0.01 Patients live longer after successful salvage of the LRR than if salvage is not possible After LRR patients have a high risk of subsequent distant metastasis and whether the second relapse is local or distant survival is uniformly poor,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[3, 1326, 1, 617, 50, 36, 1, 909, 12, 12370, 16, 6, 255, 2856, 3713, 4070, 6, 992, 137, 3, 291, 617, 3529, 32, 44, 4039, 21, 414, 23, 8, 375, 180, 1, 12370, 7, 5, 2856, 1325, 3713, 21021, 59, 1081, 2, 1346, 4080, 26534, 11611, 7, 5, 2856, 2236, 11, 108, 884, 4195, 3551, 10, 3, 4159, 260, 62, 617, 1896, 270, 4199, 2924, 2177, 3256, 11, 275, 96, 7, 11, 325, 887, 42, 449, 842, 2, 42, 77, 217, 507, 720, 198, 265, 5, 2236, 4, 4625, 7, 2056, 3551, 1, 1900, 1799, 872, 1220, 872, 2768, 2236, 489, 4, 158, 584, 2, 664, 616, 402, 1896, 563, 499, 2924, 2177, 3256, 7133, 4, 18050, 7, 4199, 557, 21021, 4, 865, 4625, 7, 42, 8, 142, 43, 1, 706, 2236, 626, 196, 50, 3, 157, 2236, 76, 3, 18050, 7, 19, 13, 680, 4, 62, 7, 833, 1, 3, 706, 3713, 11, 626, 9, 7, 54, 11, 9459, 25, 10, 97, 1069, 212, 49, 105, 243, 14, 53, 19, 13, 355, 7, 3812, 589, 50, 1401, 992, 1, 3, 2236, 76, 492, 992, 16, 44, 899, 50, 2236, 7, 47, 8, 64, 43, 1, 706, 626, 278, 2, 317, 3, 419, 429, 16, 293, 15, 626, 25, 16, 4254, 334]",1372.0,29705797,395
Postoperative hypofractionated stereotactic brain radiation (HSRT) for resected brain metastases: improved local control with higher BED<sub>10</sub>.,Journal of neuro-oncology,J. Neurooncol.,2018-05-10,"HSRT directed to large surgical beds in patients with resected brain metastases improves local control while sparing patients the toxicity associated with whole brain radiation. We review our institutional series to determine factors predictive of local failure. In a total of 39 consecutive patients with brain metastases treated from August 2011 to August 2016, 43 surgical beds were treated with HSRT in three or five fractions. All treatments were completed on a robotic radiosurgery platform using the 6D Skull tracking system. Volumetric MRIs from before and after surgery were used for radiation planning. A 2-mm PTV margin was used around the contoured surgical bed and resection margins; these were reviewed by the radiation oncologist and neurosurgeon. Lower total doses were prescribed based on proximity to critical structures or if prior radiation treatments were given. Local control in this study is defined as no volumetric MRI evidence of recurrence of tumor within the high dose radiation volume. Statistics were calculated using JMP Pro v13. Of the 43 surgical beds analyzed, 23 were from NSCLC, 5 were from breast, 4 from melanoma, 5 from esophagus, and 1 each from SCLC, sarcoma, colon, renal, rectal, and unknown primary. Ten were treated with three fractions with median dose 24 Gy and 33 were treated with five fractions with median dose 27.5 Gy using an every other day fractionation. There were no reported grade 3 or higher toxicities. Median follow up was 212 days after completion of radiation. 10 (23%) surgical beds developed local failure with a median time to failure of 148 days. All but three patients developed new brain metastases outside of the treated field and were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery, whole brain radiation and/or chemotherapy. Five patients (13%) developed leptomeningeal disease. With a median follow up of 226 days, 30 Gy/5 fx was associated with the best local control (93%) with only 1 local failure. A lower total dose in five fractions (ie 27.5 or 25 Gy) had a local control rate of 70%. For three fraction SBRT, local control was 100% using a dose of 27 Gy in three fractions (follow up was > 600 days) and 71% if 24 Gy in three fractions was used.

Liquid nitrogen spray cryotherapy for dysphagia palliation in patients with inoperable esophageal cancer.,Gastrointestinal endoscopy,Gastrointest. Endosc.,2018-05-08,"Dysphagia is a debilitating symptom in patients with inoperable esophageal cancer that contributes to poor quality of life and worsening nutritional status. The 2 most commonly used palliative modalities for dysphagia are radiation therapy and esophageal stent placement. However, radiation therapy is limited by adverse events (AEs) and total dose, and stent placement has a high rate of AEs, including reflux, migration, and chest pain. A relatively new modality of liquid nitrogen endoscopic spray cryotherapy has been described as salvage when other options have been exhausted and when patients are no longer receiving systemic therapy. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of cryotherapy as the primary modality for relieving dysphagia in inoperable esophageal cancer including patients receiving systemic cancer therapy. This is a retrospective, multicenter, consecutive case series of 49 inoperable esophageal cancer patients undergoing palliative endoscopic cryotherapy at 4 specialized cancer centers from May 2014 to May 2016. The primary outcomes were change in dysphagia scores between pre- and postcryotherapy and AEs. Dysphagia was measured using a 5-point Likert scale: 0, no dysphagia; 1, dysphagia to solids; 2, dysphagia to semisolids; 3, dysphagia to liquids; 4, dysphagia to saliva. Thirty-nine men and 10 women with a mean age of 58 years underwent a total of 120 cryotherapy treatments. The mean dysphagia score improved significantly from 2.4 precryotherapy to 1.7 postcryotherapy (improvement of .7 points; P < .001). Minor AEs were seen in 6 of 120 (5.0%) cryotherapy treatments (1 intraprocedural and 5 postprocedural). In addition, 1 patient developed a severe intraprocedural AE of dilation-related perforation, whereas another patient developed a benign stricture requiring dilation. This preliminary retrospective study suggests that liquid nitrogen spray cryotherapy may be safe and effective for dysphagia palliation in inoperable esophageal cancer. Large prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and identify patient and procedure characteristics associated with the greatest benefit.",Journal Article,623.0,2.0,Dysphagia is a debilitating symptom in patients with inoperable cancer that contributes to poor quality of life and worsening nutritional status The 2 most commonly used palliative modalities for dysphagia are radiation therapy and stent placement However radiation therapy is limited by adverse events AEs and total dose and stent placement has a high rate of AEs including reflux migration and chest pain A relatively new modality of liquid nitrogen endoscopic spray cryotherapy has been described as salvage when other options have been exhausted and when patients are no longer receiving systemic therapy We evaluated the safety and efficacy of cryotherapy as the primary modality for relieving dysphagia in inoperable cancer including patients receiving systemic cancer therapy This is a retrospective multicenter consecutive case series of 49 inoperable cancer patients undergoing palliative endoscopic cryotherapy at 4 specialized cancer centers from May 2014 to May 2016 The primary outcomes were change in dysphagia scores between pre- and postcryotherapy and AEs Dysphagia was measured using a 5-point Likert scale 0 no dysphagia 1 dysphagia to solids 2 dysphagia to semisolids 3 dysphagia to liquids 4 dysphagia to saliva Thirty-nine men and 10 women with a mean age of 58 years underwent a total of 120 cryotherapy treatments The mean dysphagia score improved significantly from 2.4 precryotherapy to 1.7 postcryotherapy improvement of .7 points P .001 Minor AEs were seen in 6 of 120 5.0 cryotherapy treatments 1 intraprocedural and 5 postprocedural In addition 1 patient developed a severe intraprocedural AE of dilation-related perforation whereas another patient developed a benign stricture requiring dilation This preliminary retrospective study suggests that liquid nitrogen spray cryotherapy may be safe and effective for dysphagia palliation in inoperable cancer Large prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and identify patient and procedure characteristics associated with the greatest benefit,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[4561, 16, 8, 8099, 934, 4, 7, 5, 3874, 12, 17, 2444, 6, 334, 372, 1, 358, 2, 4323, 5082, 156, 3, 18, 96, 841, 95, 994, 1558, 9, 4561, 32, 121, 36, 2, 7601, 2613, 137, 121, 36, 16, 383, 20, 290, 281, 1477, 2, 181, 61, 2, 7601, 2613, 71, 8, 64, 116, 1, 1477, 141, 9657, 1381, 2, 1662, 559, 8, 1352, 217, 1396, 1, 3165, 9788, 2056, 32880, 8610, 71, 85, 1027, 22, 992, 198, 127, 838, 47, 85, 9584, 2, 198, 7, 32, 77, 589, 357, 403, 36, 21, 194, 3, 367, 2, 209, 1, 8610, 22, 3, 86, 1396, 9, 13768, 4561, 4, 3874, 12, 141, 7, 357, 403, 12, 36, 26, 16, 8, 459, 1570, 935, 473, 988, 1, 739, 3874, 12, 7, 479, 994, 2056, 8610, 28, 39, 4791, 12, 1168, 29, 68, 1409, 6, 68, 1390, 3, 86, 123, 11, 707, 4, 4561, 703, 59, 671, 2, 51059, 2, 1477, 4561, 10, 644, 75, 8, 33, 741, 13181, 1124, 13, 77, 4561, 14, 4561, 6, 35835, 18, 4561, 6, 72744, 27, 4561, 6, 26360, 39, 4561, 6, 10475, 977, 762, 325, 2, 79, 117, 5, 8, 313, 89, 1, 717, 60, 208, 8, 181, 1, 2031, 8610, 640, 3, 313, 4561, 368, 231, 97, 29, 18, 39, 72745, 6, 14, 67, 51059, 767, 1, 67, 862, 19, 144, 2278, 1477, 11, 527, 4, 49, 1, 2031, 33, 13, 8610, 640, 14, 28009, 2, 33, 23734, 4, 352, 14, 69, 276, 8, 905, 28009, 3633, 1, 8062, 139, 4854, 547, 1809, 69, 276, 8, 1002, 6673, 1888, 8062, 26, 1676, 459, 45, 844, 17, 3165, 9788, 32880, 8610, 68, 40, 1165, 2, 323, 9, 4561, 3695, 4, 3874, 12, 375, 482, 94, 32, 575, 6, 1843, 46, 272, 2, 255, 69, 2, 1299, 374, 41, 5, 3, 2199, 247]",2034.0,29750984,330
Histological assessment & use of immunohistochemical markers for detection of dysplasia in Barrett's esophageal mucosa.,"Pathology, research and practice",Pathol. Res. Pract.,2018-05-16,"Histological assessment of dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus (BE) has high inter-observer variability. Hence, use of ancillary markers for early detection of dysplasia in BE is an important clinical question. In this retrospective study consecutive cases of BE (n = 59), over a period of 4 years were included. Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections were reviewed independently by 3 senior qualified pathologists, who graded the dysplasia according to the Vienna Classification system and inter-observer agreement was analysed using the Kappa statistics. Subsequently Alpha-Methyl Acyl-CoA Racemase (AMACR), p53, CyclinD1, β-catenin, H2AX and M30 immunohistochemical (IHC) stains were examined on the following disease categories: BE with no dysplasia [NFD] (45), BE with indefinite for dysplasia (IFD) (4), low grade dysplasia (LGD) (3), high grade dysplasia (HGD) (2) and in adenocarcinomas (5). H score was calculated by adding up products of different grades of stain distribution and stain intensities (range of scores 0-300). Among the 3 pathologists, overall agreement was poor (k 0.06; 95% CI -0.089 to 0.145), with highest disagreement noted for differentiating the LGD and IFDs (k = 0.21). After revising the histological criteria, the kappa improved to 0.53. Among the IHC stains performed, p53, β-catenin, H2AX and M30 stains were significantly useful to differentiate between IFD and LGD (P values: 0.04, 0.004, 0.05 & 0.04, respectively). AMACR and β-catenin stains though were up-regulated in HGD/adenocarcinomas than in other categories, their expression were not statistically different between the IFD and LGDs. A detail histological scoring system may bring uniformity in histological interpretation of dysplasia in BE.

An individualized strategy to estimate the effect of deformable registration uncertainty on accumulated dose in the upper abdomen.,Physics in medicine and biology,Phys Med Biol,2018-06-11,"In the abdomen, it is challenging to assess the accuracy of deformable image registration (DIR) for individual patients, due to the lack of clear anatomical landmarks, which can hamper clinical applications that require high accuracy DIR, such as adaptive radiotherapy. In this study, we propose and evaluate a methodology for estimating the impact of uncertainties in DIR on calculated accumulated dose in the upper abdomen, in order to aid decision making in adaptive treatment approaches. Sixteen liver metastasis patients treated with SBRT were evaluated. Each patient had one planning and three daily treatment CT-scans. Each daily CT scan was deformably registered 132 times to the planning CT-scan, using a wide range of parameter settings for the registration algorithm. A subset of 'realistic' registrations was then objectively selected based on distances between mapped and target contours. The underlying 3D transformations of these registrations were used to assess the corresponding uncertainties in voxel positions, and delivered dose, with a focus on accumulated maximum doses in the hollow OARs, i.e. esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. The number of realistic registrations varied from 5 to 109, depending on the patient, emphasizing the need for individualized registration parameters. Considering for all patients the realistic registrations, the 99th percentile of the voxel position uncertainties was 5.6  ±  3.3 mm. This translated into a variation (difference between 1st and 99th percentile) in accumulated D <sub>max</sub> in hollow OARs of up to 3.3 Gy. For one patient a violation of the accumulated stomach dose outside the uncertainty band was detected. The observed variation in accumulated doses in the OARs related to registration uncertainty, emphasizes the need to investigate the impact of this uncertainty for any DIR algorithm prior to clinical use for dose accumulation.

A VMAT planning technique for locally advanced breast cancer patients with expander or implant reconstructions requiring comprehensive postmastectomy radiation therapy.,Medical dosimetry : official journal of the American Association of Medical Dosimetrists,Med Dosim,2018-05-22,"Locally advanced breast cancer patients with expander or implant reconstructions who require comprehensive postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) can pose unique treatment planning challenges. Traditional 3D conformal radiation techniques often result in large dose inhomogeneity throughout the treatment volumes, inadequate target coverage, or excessive normal tissue doses. We have developed a volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) planning technique without entering through the ipsilateral arm that produced adequate target volume coverage, excellent homogeneity throughout the target volume, and acceptable doses to the normal structures. Twenty left-sided and 10 right-sided patients with either ipsilateral or bilateral permanent implants or tissue expanders who received comprehensive PMRT between October 2014 and February 2016 were included in this study. Ten left-sided cases used deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) technique, and others used free breathing (FB). Planning target volume (PTV) included chestwall, internal mammary nodes (IMNs), supraclavicular, and axillary lymph nodes. A VMAT plan using 4 or 5 partial arcs with 6 MV photon beam avoiding entering through the ipsilateral arm was generated for each patient. Prescription dose was 50 Gy in 25 fractions. PTV coverage, maximum depth of IMNs, dose homogeneity and dose to the heart, lungs, thyroid, contralateral intact breast or implant, liver, stomach, left anterior descending artery, ipsilateral brachial plexus, esophagus, spinal cord, and total MU were evaluated. PTV D95% (Gy) was 49.6 ± 0.9, 48.7 ± 0.9, and 49.5 ± 1.1; PTV D05% (Gy) was 55.7 ± 0.6, 55.1 ± 1.4, and 55.0 ± 0.7; maximum depth of IMNs (cm) was 4.3 ± 0.9, 4.6 ± 1.1, and 4.9 ± 2.3; ipsilateral lung, V20Gy (%) was 29.0 ± 2.1, 28.8 ± 2.5, and 27.5 ± 3.4; heart mean dose (Gy) was 4.2 ± 0.4, 7.5 ± 1.1, and 6.6 ± 0.8 for right-sided FB, left-sided FB, and left-sided DIBH cases, respectively. D95% of IMNs all received 100% prescription dose. The maximum dose (Gy) to the left anterior descending artery was 33.8 ± 11.7 for left-sided FB and 31.4 ± 7.3 for left-sided DIBH.

"Comparative Molecular Analyses of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Esophageal Adenocarcinoma, and Gastric Adenocarcinoma.",The oncologist,Oncologist,2018-06-04,"Gastroesophageal cancers are often grouped together even though cancers that originate in the esophagus often exhibit different histological features, geographical distribution, risk factors, and clinical characteristics than those originating in the stomach. Herein, we aimed to compare the molecular characteristics of three different gastroesophageal cancer types: esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), and gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC). In total, 3,342 gastroesophageal cancers were examined. Next-generation sequencing was performed on genomic DNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples using the NextSeq platform. Tumor mutational burden was measured by counting all nonsynonymous missense mutations, and microsatellite instability was examined at over 7,000 target microsatellite loci. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization techniques were also performed. When compared with EAC and GAC, ESCC showed significantly lower mutational rates within <i>APC, ARID1A, CDH1, KRAS, PTEN,</i> and <i>SMAD4</i>, whereas more frequent mutations were observed in <i>BAP1, CDKN2A, FOXO3, KMT2D, MSH6, NOTCH1, RB1,</i> and <i>SETD2</i>. Human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression was observed in 13% of EAC compared with 6% of GAC and 1% of ESCC (<i>p</i> < .0001). Compared with EAC and GAC, ESCC exhibited higher expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) (27.7% vs. 7.5% vs. 7.7%, <i>p</i> < .0001). We observed that <i>FGF3</i>, <i>FGF4</i>, <i>FGF19</i>, <i>CCND1</i> (co-localized on 11q13), and <i>FGFR1</i> were significantly more amplified in ESCC compared with EAC and GAC (<i>p</i> < .0001). Molecular comparisons between ESCC, EAC, and GAC revealed distinct differences between squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas in each platform tested. Different prevalence of HER2/neu overexpression and amplification, and immune-related biomarkers between ESCC, EAC, and GAC, suggests different sensitivity to HER2-targeted therapy and immune checkpoint inhibition. These findings bring into question the validity of grouping patients with EAC and ESCC together in clinical trials and provide insight into molecular features that may represent novel therapeutic targets. This study highlights the genomic heterogeneity of gastroesophageal cancers, showing striking molecular differences between tumors originating from different locations. Moreover, this study showed that esophageal squamous cell carcinomas exhibit a unique molecular profile, whereas gastric adenocarcinomas and esophageal adenocarcinomas have some similarities, supporting the fact that adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas are completely different diseases, irrespective of the tumor location. This raises the question of whether treatment of gastroesophageal tumors should be determined according to histological subtype and molecular targets rather than anatomical site. These findings provide insights that could enable physicians to better select patients and inform therapeutic choices in order to improve clinical outcome.",Journal

The role of next-generation sequencing in the differential diagnosis of composite neoplasms.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2018-06-26,"Composite neoplasms (CNs) are rare and diagnostically challenging lesions that require differentiating between mixed clonal tumors with divergent phenotypes (MT), collision of 2 independent tumors adjacent to each other (CT), and tumor-to-tumor metastasis (TTM). To that end, pathologists have traditionally used immunohistochemistry and limited molecular studies, such as Sanger sequencing. Herein we evaluate the potential application of NGS in the differential diagnosis of these rare neoplasms. Four CNs were included in the study. Two were diagnosed as MT (mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma of the gallbladder and metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma with squamous dedifferentiation) and 2 were interpreted as TTM (esophageal adenocarcinoma to lung adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma of the lung to meningeal melanoma). Diagnoses were made using clinical, histologic, and immunophenotypic information, with the aid of limited molecular studies in 2 cases. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was dissected for DNA and RNA extraction, and NGS was performed using the Oncomine Comprehensive Panel. The 2 tumors initially interpreted as MT showed shared genetic aberrations in the different neoplastic components, supporting the pathologic diagnosis. NGS results for the lesion diagnosed as esophageal adenocarcinoma metastatic to lung adenocarcinoma did not support the histopathologic interpretation and were deemed inconclusive. However, the identification of an identical CDKN2A mutation in all components and in the adjacent benign lung parenchyma suggests a possible germline aberration. Sequencing results in the last case were clearly supportive of TTM. This study illustrates the role of NGS in the diagnostic workup of CNs, as an adjunct to light microscopy and immunohistochemistry.",Case Reports,574.0,0.0,Composite neoplasms CNs are rare and diagnostically challenging lesions that require differentiating between mixed clonal tumors with divergent phenotypes MT collision of 2 independent tumors adjacent to each other CT and tumor-to-tumor metastasis TTM To that end pathologists have traditionally used immunohistochemistry and limited molecular studies such as Sanger sequencing Herein we evaluate the potential application of NGS in the differential diagnosis of these rare neoplasms Four CNs were included in the study Two were diagnosed as MT mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma of the and metastatic papillary carcinoma with squamous dedifferentiation and 2 were interpreted as TTM adenocarcinoma to adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma of the to meningeal Diagnoses were made using clinical histologic and immunophenotypic information with the aid of limited molecular studies in 2 cases Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue was dissected for DNA and RNA extraction and NGS was performed using the Oncomine Comprehensive Panel The 2 tumors initially interpreted as MT showed shared genetic aberrations in the different neoplastic components supporting the pathologic diagnosis NGS results for the lesion diagnosed as adenocarcinoma metastatic to adenocarcinoma did not support the histopathologic interpretation and were deemed inconclusive However the identification of an identical CDKN2A mutation in all components and in the adjacent benign parenchyma suggests a possible germline aberration Sequencing results in the last case were clearly supportive of TTM This study illustrates the role of NGS in the diagnostic workup of CNs as an adjunct to light microscopy and immunohistochemistry,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,"[3308, 1179, 1025, 32, 622, 2, 13778, 1950, 406, 17, 1353, 5209, 59, 1739, 1946, 57, 5, 8332, 2618, 4875, 21549, 1, 18, 306, 57, 2086, 6, 296, 127, 425, 2, 30, 6, 30, 278, 42097, 6, 17, 396, 3354, 47, 4206, 95, 888, 2, 383, 219, 94, 225, 22, 7285, 615, 1986, 21, 376, 3, 174, 1581, 1, 2650, 4, 3, 1777, 147, 1, 46, 622, 1179, 294, 1025, 11, 159, 4, 3, 45, 100, 11, 265, 22, 4875, 1739, 73138, 134, 1, 3, 2, 113, 1796, 134, 5, 691, 9496, 2, 18, 11, 5047, 22, 42097, 449, 6, 449, 2, 302, 31, 134, 1, 3, 6, 13543, 2403, 11, 1229, 75, 38, 884, 2, 6599, 487, 5, 3, 2427, 1, 383, 219, 94, 4, 18, 140, 3265, 1959, 2487, 2505, 246, 10, 7973, 9, 261, 2, 893, 5763, 2, 2650, 10, 173, 75, 3, 17919, 949, 993, 3, 18, 57, 1625, 5047, 22, 4875, 224, 2664, 336, 2152, 4, 3, 338, 2000, 1628, 1912, 3, 510, 147, 2650, 99, 9, 3, 1180, 265, 22, 449, 113, 6, 449, 205, 44, 538, 3, 2630, 3037, 2, 11, 3779, 6791, 137, 3, 911, 1, 35, 3038, 3175, 258, 4, 62, 1628, 2, 4, 3, 2086, 1002, 5388, 844, 8, 899, 1009, 7794, 615, 99, 4, 3, 1060, 473, 11, 2536, 1877, 1, 42097, 26, 45, 6342, 3, 200, 1, 2650, 4, 3, 752, 4755, 1, 1025, 22, 35, 5471, 6, 1691, 3804, 2, 888]",1702.0,29958927,11

A comprehensive methylation signature identifies lymph node metastasis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2018-10-16,"Treatment modalities in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) depend largely on lymph node metastasis (LNM) status. With suboptimal detection sensitivity of existing imaging techniques, we propose a methylation signature which identifies patients with LNM with greater accuracy. This would allow precise stratification of high-risk patients requiring more aggressive treatment from low-risk ESCC patients who can forego radical surgery. An unbiased genome-wide methylation signature for LNM detection was established from an initial in silico discovery phase. The signature was tested in independent clinical cohorts comprising of 249 ESCC patients. The prognostic potential of the methylation signature was compared to clinical variables including LNM status. A 10-probe LNM associated signature (LNAS) was developed using stringent bioinformatics analyses. The area under the curve values for LNAS risk scores were 0.81 and 0.88 in the training and validation cohorts respectively, in association with lymphatic vessel invasion and tumor stage. High LNAS risk-score was also associated with worse overall survival [HR (95% CI) 3 (1.8-4.8), p < 0.0001 training and 3.9 (1.5-10.2), p = 0.001 validation cohort].

Survival prediction tools for esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancer: A systematic review.,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg.,2018-04-12,"Clinical, pathological, and molecular information combined with cancer stage in prognostication algorithms can offer more personalized estimates of survival, which might guide treatment choices. Our aim was to evaluate the quality of prognostication tools in esophageal cancer. We systematically searched MedLine and Embase from 2005 to 2017 for studies reporting development or validation of models predicting long-term survival in esophageal cancer. We evaluated tools using the Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies guidelines and the American Joint Committee on Cancer acceptance criteria for risk models. We identified 16 prognostication tools for patients treated with curative intent and 1 for patients with metastatic disease. These tools frequently excluded adenocarcinoma, contained outdated data, and were developed with a limited sample size. Nine tools were developed in China for squamous cell cancer, and 11 used data on patients diagnosed before 2010. Most tools excluded key prognostic factors such as age and sex. Tumor stage and grade were the most commonly, but not universally, included factors. Twelve tools were designed to predict overall survival; 5 predicted cancer-specific survival.

Survival Disparities by Race and Ethnicity in Early Esophageal Cancer.,Digestive diseases and sciences,Dig. Dis. Sci.,2018-08-14,"Survival outcome disparities among esophageal cancer patients exist, but are not fully understood. We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database to determine whether survival differences among racial/ethnic patient populations persist after adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics. Our study included T1-3N0M0 adenocarcinoma and squamous cell cancer patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2011. We compared survival among two racial/ethnic patient subgroups using Cox proportional hazards methods, adjusting for age, sex, histology, marital status, socioeconomics, SEER region, comorbidities, T stage, tumor location, diagnosis year, and treatment received. Among 2025 patients, 87.9% were White and 12.1% were Nonwhite. Median survival was 18.7 months for Whites vs 13.8 months for Nonwhites (p = 0.01). In the unadjusted model, Nonwhite patients had higher risk of mortality (HR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.11-1.49, p < 0.0001) when compared to White patients; however, in the Cox regression adjusted model there was no significant difference (HR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.80-1.10, p = 0.44). Surgery, chemotherapy, younger age, lower T stage, and lower Charlson comorbidity score were significant predictors in the full adjusted model. Differences in mortality risk by race/ethnicity appear to be largely explained by additional factors. In particular, associations were seen in surgery and T stage.

CheckMate-032 Study: Efficacy and Safety of Nivolumab and Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab in Patients With Metastatic Esophagogastric Cancer.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2018-08-15,"Metastatic esophagogastric cancer treatments after failure of second-line chemotherapy are limited. Nivolumab demonstrated superior overall survival (OS) versus placebo in Asian patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancers. We assessed the safety and efficacy of nivolumab and nivolumab plus ipilimumab in Western patients with chemotherapy-refractory esophagogastric cancers. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic chemotherapy-refractory gastric, esophageal, or gastroesophageal junction cancer from centers in the United States and Europe received nivolumab or nivolumab plus ipilimumab. The primary end point was objective response rate. The association of tumor programmed death-ligand 1 status with response and survival was also evaluated. Of 160 treated patients (59 with nivolumab 3 mg/kg, 49 with nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg, 52 with nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg), 79% had received two or more prior therapies. At the data cutoff, investigator-assessed objective response rates were 12% (95% CI, 5% to 23%), 24% (95% CI, 13% to 39%), and 8% (95% CI, 2% to 19%) in the three groups, respectively. Responses were observed regardless of tumor programmed death-ligand 1 status. With a median follow-up of 28, 24, and 22 months across the three groups, 12-month progression-free survival rates were 8%, 17%, and 10%, respectively; 12-month OS rates were 39%, 35%, and 24%, respectively. Treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events were reported in 17%, 47%, and 27% of patients in the three groups, respectively. Nivolumab and nivolumab plus ipilimumab demonstrated clinically meaningful antitumor activity, durable responses, encouraging long-term OS, and a manageable safety profile in patients with chemotherapy-refractory esophagogastric cancer.

Association of Target Volume Margins With Locoregional Control and Acute Toxicities for Non-small cell lung cancer Treated With Concurrent Chemoradiation Therapy.,Practical radiation oncology,Pract Radiat Oncol,2018-08-23,"This study aimed to investigate the association between target volume margins and clinical outcomes for patients with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with concurrent chemoradiation therapy. We reviewed the records of 82 patients with inoperable NSCLC treated between 2009 and 2016 with concurrent chemoradiation. All patients received positron emission tomography-based treatment planning, 4-dimensional computed tomography simulation to define an internal target volume, and daily cone beam computed tomography. We quantified variations in target volume margins with a margin deviation index (MDI), calculated as the percentage change in equivalent uniform dose between the original planning target volume (PTV) and a standard reference PTV 10 mm beyond the original gross tumor volume, consistent with the minimum margins mandated by recent NSCLC trials. Greater MDIs equated to smaller effective target volume margins. We dichotomized patients by the upper tercile MDI value (5.8%). Endpoints included time to locoregional progression and time to grade ≥ 3 radiation esophagitis (RE3) or radiation pneumonitis (RP3), modelled with the Fine-Gray method. Median follow-up was 37.8 months (range, 5.9-58.1 months). Larger MDIs correlated with smaller clinical target volume (CTV) + PTV margins, larger gross tumor volumes, later treatment year, and intensity modulated radiation therapy use. The risk of locoregional progression did not differ for MDI ≥5.8% versus <5.8% (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.88; P = .76), but the risk of RE3 or RP3 was decreased for MDI ≥5.8% (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.27; P = .027).

Serum miR-331-3p predicts tumor recurrence in esophageal adenocarcinoma.,Scientific reports,Sci Rep,2018-09-18,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) may contribute to the initiation and progression of cancer. The role of circulating miRNAs as predictors of recurrence in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has not been extensively explored. Here we measured the expressions of 167 miRNAs in serum samples from a discovery cohort of 72 EAC patients (32 patients with recurrence and 40 patients without). A rank sum test was performed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs. Cox regression model was applied to estimate the effect of miRNA expression on recurrence-free survival. The eligible miRNAs were then validated in an independent cohort of 329 EAC patients (132 patients with recurrence and 197 patients without). miR-331-3p was identified and confirmed to be differentially expressed between EAC patients with and without recurrence and associated with recurrence-free survival. In both cohorts, the expression of miR-331-3p was consistently decreased in patients with recurrence compared to those without (P < 0.05). Using patients with low expression of miR-331-3p as reference, those with high expression had HRs for recurrence of 0.45 (95% CI, 0.21-0.96, P = 0.040) and 0.55 (95% CI, 0.38-0.78, P = 0.001) in the discovery and validation cohorts, respectively.

Primary prevention of cancer is a logical strategy to use to control cancer while also seeking novel treatments and earlier detection. Lifestyle modification strategies to improve primary prevention and risk reduction for the development of cancer include choosing a healthy diet with an emphasis on plant sources, maintaining a healthy weight throughout life, being physically active, regularly using sunscreen and wearing protective clothing, limiting sun exposure during the hours of 10 AM to 2 PM, avoiding indoor tanning, and reducing or eliminating alcohol use. In addition to continued use of ongoing education of the public, health care providers, and cancer support communities, other policy and public health efforts should be pursued as well. Examples of supported and successful policy approaches are included in this article, including efforts to limit indoor tanning and improve community-wide interventions to reduce ultraviolet radiation exposure as well as to formally support various alcohol policy strategies including increasing alcohol taxes, reducing alcohol outlet density, improving clinical screening for alcohol use disorders, and limiting youth exposure to alcohol marketing and advertising. These prevention strategies are expected to have the largest impact on the development of melanoma as well as breast, colorectal, head and neck, liver, and esophageal cancers.

Immune Therapeutics in the Treatment of Advanced Gastric and Esophageal Cancer.,Anticancer research,Anticancer Res.,2018-10-01,"Systemic chemotherapy is the mainstay of therapy in patients with advanced gastric and esophageal cancer, but has multiple drawbacks including lack of durable efficacy and dose limited toxicities. Recent clinical trials data on the efficacy of immune therapy in this patient group have shed light on its potential as an alternative treatment option. Checkpoint inhibitors, specifically the anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, seem to be beneficial for a subgroup of patients with advanced gastric or esophageal cancer who have progressed on multiple systemic chemotherapies. As clinical trials results mature, it will become apparent whether checkpoint inhibitors are effective in other treatment settings such as in first-line therapy or adjuvant therapy. Although the toxicity of checkpoint inhibitors is generally unpredictable, they tend to be more manageable and better tolerated than the toxicities of systemic chemotherapy. Furthermore, recent research in molecular subtyping of esophageal and gastric cancer are paving way for better treatment response prediction and patient selection for checkpoint inhibitor therapies. Compared to checkpoint inhibitors, other types of immune therapies such as cancer vaccines, and adoptive cell therapies have yet to be proven effective in esophageal and gastric cancer and are further away from clinical use.

Increasing prevalence of high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma on index endoscopy in Barrett's esophagus over the past 2 decades: data from a multicenter U.S. consortium.,Gastrointestinal endoscopy,Gastrointest. Endosc.,2018-10-17,"Data on time trends of dysplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in Barrett's esophagus (BE) during the index endoscopy (ie, prevalent cases) are limited. Our aim was to determine the prevalence patterns of BE-associated dysplasia on index endoscopy over the past 25 years. The Barrett's Esophagus Study is a multicenter outcome project of a large cohort of patients with BE. Proportions of patients with index endoscopy findings of no dysplasia (NDBE), low-grade dysplasia (LGD), high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and EAC were extracted per year of index endoscopy, and 5-yearly patient cohorts were tabulated over years 1990 to 2010+ (2010-current). Prevalent dysplasia and endoscopic findings were trended over the past 25 years using percentage dysplasia (LGD, HGD, EAC, and HGD/EAC) to assess changes in detection of BE-associated dysplasia over the last 25 years. Statistical analysis was done using SAS version 9.4 software (SAS, Cary, NC). A total of 3643 patients were included in the analysis with index endoscopy showing NDBE in 2513 (70.1%), LGD in 412 (11.5%), HGD in 193 (5.4%), and EAC in 181 (5.1%). Over time, there was an increase in the mean age of patients with BE (51.7 ± 29 years vs 62.6 ± 11.3 years) and the proportion of males (84% vs 92.6%) diagnosed with BE but a decrease in the mean BE length (4.4±4.3 cm vs 2.9±3.0 cm) as time progressed (1990-1994 to 2010-2016 time periods). The presence of LGD on index endoscopy remained stable over 1990 to 2016. However, a significant increase (148% in HGD and 112% in EAC) in the diagnosis of HGD, EAC, and HGD/EAC was noted on index endoscopy over the last 25 years (P < .001).

Efficacy [sustained virologic response at 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12)], cancer-related outcomes and adverse events (AEs) were assessed. We included 153 patients. Most were men (109; 71%), white (92; 60%), non-cirrhotic (105; 69%), and with HCV genotype 1 (110; 72%). The most common cancers were hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (27; 18%) and multiple myeloma (14; 9%). The overall SVR12 rate was 91% (128/141). SVR12 was 100% in patients treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 8 weeks.

Identification of Adenosquamous Carcinoma as a Rare Aggressive HER2-negative Subgroup of Esophageal/Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma.,American journal of clinical oncology,Am. J. Clin. Oncol.,2019-02-01,"Our purpose was to evaluate the prognostic impact of pathologically confirmed esophageal adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC) and its association with HER2 status and clinicopathologic characteristics. Among 796 patients with esophageal or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who underwent curative resection, surgical pathology reports were reviewed, and suspected ASC was confirmed utilizing p63 and CK5/6 immunostaining. HER2 status was determined using immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Cox models were used to assess the impact of ASC on disease-specific survival and overall survival. Overall, 2.0% (16/796) of patients had esophageal ASC, mostly demonstrating a close intermingling of squamous and adenocarcinoma cells within the same tumor. The percentage of squamous versus adenocarcinoma cells in the primary was generally recapitulated in nodal metastases, and intrapatient internodal heterogeneity was uncommon. Patients with esophageal ASC were statistically significantly more likely to be female (vs. male), have normal (vs. excess) body mass index, and harbor HER2-negative (vs. positive) tumors, as compared with patients with adenocarcinoma only. No ASC tumor was HER2-positive as compared with 16% of adenocarcinoma only tumors (P=0.018).

Assessment of Between-Hospital Variation in Readmission and Mortality After Cancer Surgical Procedures.,JAMA network open,JAMA Netw Open,2018-10-05,"Although current federal quality improvement programs do not include cancer surgery, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and other payers are considering extending readmission reduction initiatives to include these and other common high-cost episodes. To quantify between-hospital variation in quality-related outcomes and identify hospital characteristics associated with high and low performance. This retrospective cohort study obtained data through linkage of the California Cancer Registry to hospital discharge claims databases maintained by the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. All 351 acute care hospitals in California at which 1 or more adults underwent curative intent surgery between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2011, with analyses finalized July 15, 2018, were included. A total of 138 799 adults undergoing surgery for colorectal, breast, lung, prostate, bladder, thyroid, kidney, endometrial, pancreatic, liver, or esophageal cancer within 6 months of diagnosis, with an American Joint Committee on Cancer stage of I to III at diagnosis, were included. Measures included adjusted odds ratios and variance components from hierarchical mixed-effects logistic regression analyses of in-hospital mortality, 90-day readmission, and 90-day mortality, as well as hospital-specific risk-adjusted rates and risk-adjusted standardized rate ratios for hospitals with a mean annual surgical volume of 10 or more. Across 138 799 patients at the 351 included hospitals, 8.9% were aged 18 to 44 years and 45.9% were aged 65 years or older, 57.4% were women, and 18.2% were nonwhite. Among these, 1240 patients (0.9%) died during the index admission. Among 137 559 patients discharged alive, 19 670 (14.3%) were readmitted and 1754 (1.3%) died within 90 days. After adjusting for patient case-mix differences, evidence of statistically significant variation in risk across hospitals was identified, as characterized by the variance of the random effects in the mixed model, for all 3 metrics (P < .001). In addition, substantial variation was observed in hospital performance profiles: across 260 hospitals with a mean annual surgical volume of 10 or more, 59 (22.7%) had lower-than-expected rates for all 3 metrics, 105 (40.4%) had higher-than-expected rates for 2 of the 3, and 19 (7.3%) had higher-than-expected rates for all 3 metrics. Accounting for patient case-mix differences, there appears to be substantial between-hospital variation in in-hospital mortality, 90-day readmission, and 90-day mortality after cancer surgical procedures.

Pilot Prehabilitation Program for Patients With Esophageal Cancer During Neoadjuvant Therapy and Surgery.,The Journal of surgical research,J. Surg. Res.,2018-10-23,"Locally advanced esophageal cancer is often treated with neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery. Many patients present with or experience clinical deconditioning during neoadjuvant therapy. Prehabilitation programs in other areas of surgery have demonstrated improved postoperative outcomes. The aims of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of a pilot prehabilitation program and determine preliminary effects on surgical and cancer-related outcomes. A retrospective review of patients treated at a single institution with resectable esophageal cancer was performed (n = 22). Patients in the prehabilitation group received protocol-structured intervention in several clinical domains including nutrition, psychosocial support, and physical exercise. Clinical stage and comorbidities were well matched between groups. The structured prehabilitation program was feasible and well received by participants. Fewer patients required admission during neoadjuvant therapy in the prehabilitation group (27.3% versus 54.5%). Percentage weight loss during treatment was 3.0% in the prehabilitation group versus 4.3% in the control group. Compared with the control group, the prehabilitation group demonstrated 0.0% versus 18.2% 30-d postoperative readmission rate and 18.2% versus 27.3% 90-d postoperative readmission rate. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in regard to complications or mortality. The pilot prehabilitation program demonstrated feasibility of implementing a structured program for patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy for esophageal cancer.

Immunother.,2019-02-15,"CV9201 is an RNActive<sup>®</sup>-based cancer immunotherapy encoding five non-small cell lung cancer-antigens: New York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma-1, melanoma antigen family C1/C2, survivin, and trophoblast glycoprotein. In a phase I/IIa dose-escalation trial, 46 patients with locally advanced (n = 7) or metastatic (n = 39) NSCLC and at least stable disease after first-line treatment received five intradermal CV9201 injections (400-1600 µg of mRNA). The primary objective of the trial was to assess safety. Secondary objectives included assessment of antibody and ex vivo T cell responses against the five antigens, and changes in immune cell populations. All CV9201 dose levels were well-tolerated and the recommended dose for phase IIa was 1600 µg. Most AEs were mild-to-moderate injection site reactions and flu-like symptoms. Three (7%) patients had grade 3 related AEs. No related grade 4/5 or related serious AEs occurred. In phase IIa, antigen-specific immune responses against ≥ 1 antigen were detected in 63% of evaluable patients after treatment. The frequency of activated IgD<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> B cells increased > twofold in 18/30 (60%) evaluable patients. 9/29 (31%) evaluable patients in phase IIa had stable disease and 20/29 (69%) had progressive disease.

Genome-wide tracts of homozygosity and exome analyses reveal repetitive elements with Barrets esophagus/esophageal adenocarcinoma risk.,BMC bioinformatics,BMC Bioinformatics,2019-03-14,"Barrett's esophagus (BE) is most commonly seen as the condition in which the normal squamous epithelium lining of the esophagus is replaced by goblet cells. Many studies show that BE is a predisposing factor for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a particularly lethal cancer. The use of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to map BE/EAC genes has previously provided insufficient genetic information to fully characterize the heterogeneous nature of the disease. We therefore hypothesize that rigorous interrogation of other types of genomic changes, e.g. tracts of homozygosity (TOH), repetitive elements, and insertion/deletions, may provide a comprehensive understanding of the development of BE/EAC. First, we used a case-control framework to identify TOHs by using SNPs and tested for association with BE/EAC. Second, we used a case only approach on a validation series of eight samples subjected to exome sequencing to identify repeat elements and insertion/deletions. Third, insertion/deletions and repeat elements identified in the exomes were then mapped onto genes in the significant TOH regions. Overall, 24 TOH regions were significantly differentially represented among cases, as compared to controls (adjusted-P = 0.002-0.039). Interestingly, four BE/EAC-associated genes within the TOH regions consistently showed insertions and deletions that overlapped across eight exomes. Predictive functional analysis identified NOTCH, WNT, and G-protein inflammation pathways that affect BE and EAC. The integration of common TOHs (cTOHs) with repetitive elements, insertions, and deletions within exomes can help functionally prioritize factors contributing to low to moderate penetrance predisposition to BE/EAC.",Journal Article,313.0,1.0,Barrett 's BE is most commonly seen as the condition in which the normal squamous epithelium lining of the is replaced by goblet cells Many studies show that BE is a predisposing factor for the development of adenocarcinoma EAC a particularly lethal cancer The use of single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs to map BE/EAC genes has previously provided insufficient genetic information to fully characterize the heterogeneous nature of the disease We therefore hypothesize that rigorous interrogation of other types of genomic changes e.g tracts of homozygosity TOH repetitive elements and insertion/deletions may provide a comprehensive understanding of the development of BE/EAC First we used a case-control framework to identify TOHs by using SNPs and tested for association with BE/EAC Second we used a case only approach on a validation series of eight samples subjected to exome sequencing to identify repeat elements and insertion/deletions Third insertion/deletions and repeat elements identified in the exomes were then mapped onto genes in the significant TOH regions Overall 24 TOH regions were significantly differentially represented among cases as compared to controls adjusted-P 0.002-0.039 Interestingly four BE/EAC-associated genes within the TOH regions consistently showed insertions and deletions that overlapped across eight exomes Predictive functional analysis identified NOTCH WNT and G-protein inflammation pathways that affect BE and EAC The integration of common TOHs cTOHs with repetitive elements insertions and deletions within exomes can help functionally prioritize factors contributing to low to moderate penetrance predisposition to BE/EAC,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[4366, 292, 40, 16, 96, 841, 527, 22, 3, 2850, 4, 92, 3, 295, 691, 2781, 10597, 1, 3, 16, 6928, 20, 16930, 37, 445, 94, 514, 17, 40, 16, 8, 6885, 161, 9, 3, 193, 1, 449, 3378, 8, 823, 2266, 12, 3, 119, 1, 226, 1579, 1203, 1109, 6, 3771, 40, 3378, 214, 71, 373, 1052, 3027, 336, 487, 6, 1910, 1507, 3, 1564, 2202, 1, 3, 34, 21, 673, 4919, 17, 6496, 8956, 1, 127, 630, 1, 572, 400, 563, 499, 10950, 1, 12656, 20764, 9246, 2531, 2, 5099, 2439, 68, 377, 8, 949, 612, 1, 3, 193, 1, 40, 3378, 157, 21, 95, 8, 473, 182, 2586, 6, 255, 23969, 20, 75, 1109, 2, 650, 9, 248, 5, 40, 3378, 419, 21, 95, 8, 473, 158, 353, 23, 8, 929, 988, 1, 659, 347, 4325, 6, 2865, 615, 6, 255, 2334, 2531, 2, 5099, 2439, 1282, 5099, 2439, 2, 2334, 2531, 108, 4, 3, 12233, 11, 818, 6224, 3301, 214, 4, 3, 93, 20764, 1374, 63, 259, 20764, 1374, 11, 97, 2478, 3324, 107, 140, 22, 72, 6, 535, 586, 19, 13, 1111, 13, 5955, 2873, 294, 40, 3378, 41, 214, 262, 3, 20764, 1374, 2433, 224, 6315, 2, 2439, 17, 12117, 716, 659, 12233, 464, 583, 65, 108, 3193, 2112, 2, 499, 178, 1815, 460, 17, 1158, 40, 2, 3378, 3, 2676, 1, 186, 23969, 39918, 5, 9246, 2531, 6315, 2, 2439, 262, 12233, 122, 987, 3772, 7716, 130, 3156, 6, 154, 6, 1163, 4792, 2863, 6, 40, 3378]",1669.0,30871476,698

Our group previously published a prognostic index, the Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA) for GI cancer patients with BM, based on 209 patients diagnosed from 1985-2005. The purpose of this analysis is to identify prognostic factors for GI cancer patients with newly diagnosed BM in a larger contemporary cohort. A multi-institutional retrospective IRB-approved database of 792 GI cancer patients with new BM diagnosed from 1/1/2006 to 12/31/2016 was created. Demographic data, clinical parameters, and treatment were correlated with survival and time from primary diagnosis to BM (TPDBM). Kaplan-Meier median survival (MS) estimates were calculated and compared with log-rank tests. The MS from time of first treatment for BM for the prior and current cohorts were 5 and 8 months, respectively (P < 0.001). Eight prognostic factors (age, stage, primary site, resection of primary tumor, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), extracranial metastases, number of BM and Hgb were found to be significant for survival, in contrast to only one (KPS) in the prior cohort. In this cohort, the most common primary sites were rectum (24%) and esophagus (23%). Median TPDBM was 22 months. Notably, 37% (267/716) presented with poor prognosis (GPA 0-1.0).

Brief Pain Inventory average pain severity (P = .007) and interference (P = .004) were lower for RAMIE. RAMIE had lower estimated blood loss (250 vs 350 cm<sup>3</sup>; P < .001), shorter length of stay (9 vs 11 days; P < .001), fewer intensive care unit admissions (8% vs 20%; P = .033), more lymph nodes harvested (25 vs 22; P = .05), and longer surgical time (6.4 vs 5.4 hours; P < .001). Major complications (39% for RAMIE vs 52% for open esophagectomy; P > .95), anastomotic leak (3% vs 9%; P = .41), and 90-day mortality (2% vs 4%; P = .85) did not differ between groups. Pulmonary (14% vs 34%; P = .014) and infectious (17% vs 36%; P = .029) complications were lower for RAMIE.

A retrospective analysis of electronic medical records (Flatiron Health, New York) was conducted among patients initiating first-line therapy from January 1, 2013, through April 30, 2018. Eligible patients were diagnosed with advanced gastric, gastroesophageal junction, or esophageal adenocarcinoma and ≥18 years of age at the time of treatment initiation. Patients alive 45 days after discontinuation of first-line therapy were considered potentially eligible for continued therapy and were categorized into those who received and those who did not receive second-line therapy. Survival analyses were conducted using Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test without adjusting for any baseline covariates. Factors associated with further treatment were evaluated using logistic regression. A total of 3850 patients met eligibility criteria. Among the 2516 patients available to receive second-line therapy, 1515 (60.2%) received second-line therapy and 1001 (39.8%) did not receive further therapy. Among those potentially eligible to receive second-line therapy, median survival was 15.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.6-16.0) from initiation of first-line therapy for those who received second-line therapy and 10.0 months (95% CI: 9.3-10.7) for those who did not.

Mediastinal Nodal Involvement After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation for Siewert II/III Adenocarcinoma.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2019-05-15,"Adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction (AEG) poses a management challenge, as preoperative prediction of occult mediastinal nodal metastasis is difficult. We sought to identify factors predictive of mediastinal involvement among patients undergoing trimodality therapy. Patients undergoing trimodality therapy for Siewert II and III AEG at a single institution between 2000 and 2015 were identified. Mediastinal involvement was defined as pathologic nodal involvement after neoadjuvant chemoradiation (ypN+) in mediastinal stations or mediastinal recurrence 2 years or less after resection. Maximal χ<sup>2</sup> analysis and Youden's J index were used to identify the pretreatment proximal tumor extent that best discriminated mediastinal involvement. In all, 204 patients (151 [74%] AEG II, 53 [26%] AEG III) were included, of whom 47 (23%) had clinical evidence of thoracic nodal disease. Thirty-one of the 204 patients (15%) met criteria for mediastinal involvement (24 of 31 ypN+, 10 of 31 mediastinal recurrence).

"Racial Disparities, Outcomes, and Surgical Utilization among Hispanics with Esophageal Cancer: A Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program Database Analysis.",Oncology,Oncology,2019-05-20,"Hispanic patients with esophageal cancer (EC) have racially disparate survival outcomes compared with white patients. We explored the impact on survival of racial differences in socioeconomic factors, tumor characteristics, and rates of surgical utilization in patients with EC. Using the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) registry, we identified 22,531 cases of EC in Hispanic and white patients between the ages of 18 and 65 years in 2003-2014. Of these, 6,250 cases had locoregional EC. Patients were categorized according to age, gender, education, tumor grade, histology, primary tumor site, and surgical status. Postdiagnosis survival was examined over time and compared by race and stratified by surgical status. Compared with whites, Hispanics with EC had significantly higher unadjusted mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.17; p < 0.001) as did Hispanics with locoregional EC (HR 1.15; 95% CI 1.03-1.29; p = 0.01). In the multivariate analysis, several socioeconomic and tumor factors were found to be independently associated with survival by race, including county of residence income and prevalence of smoking, tumor grade, stage, and primary site, and surgical utilization. After adjusting for demographic and tumor characteristics, surgical utilization in patients with locoregional EC had a significant interaction with race on overall mortality (p = 0.01). Hispanics with locoregional EC were significantly less likely to receive surgery than whites (46 vs. 60%; p < 0.001) and not receiving surgery was associated with a significantly lower overall survival (HR 2.84; 95% CI 2.65-3.04; p < 0.001). A lower rate of surgery among Hispanics with potentially resectable esophageal cancer was associated with a decreased survival rate when compared to whites, even when adjusting for relevant socioeconomic and tumor factors. These data support the need to better address patient barriers to surgical treatment and the systemic biases present in medical care.",Journal Article,246.0,0.0,"Hispanic patients with cancer EC have racially disparate survival outcomes compared with white patients We explored the impact on survival of racial differences in socioeconomic factors tumor characteristics and rates of surgical utilization in patients with EC Using the SEER Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results registry we identified 22,531 cases of EC in Hispanic and white patients between the ages of 18 and 65 years in 2003-2014 Of these 6,250 cases had locoregional EC Patients were categorized according to age gender education tumor grade histology primary tumor site and surgical status Postdiagnosis survival was examined over time and compared by race and stratified by surgical status Compared with whites Hispanics with EC had significantly higher unadjusted mortality hazard ratio HR 1.11 95 confidence interval CI 1.06-1.17 p 0.001 as did Hispanics with locoregional EC HR 1.15 95 CI 1.03-1.29 p 0.01 In the multivariate analysis several socioeconomic and tumor factors were found to be independently associated with survival by race including county of residence income and prevalence of smoking tumor grade stage and primary site and surgical utilization After adjusting for demographic and tumor characteristics surgical utilization in patients with locoregional EC had a significant interaction with race on overall mortality p 0.01 Hispanics with locoregional EC were significantly less likely to receive surgery than whites 46 vs. 60 p 0.001 and not receiving surgery was associated with a significantly lower overall survival HR 2.84 95 CI 2.65-3.04 p 0.001 A lower rate of surgery among Hispanics with potentially resectable cancer was associated with a decreased survival rate when compared to whites even when adjusting for relevant socioeconomic and tumor factors These data support the need to better address patient barriers to surgical treatment and the systemic biases present in medical care",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[1776, 7, 5, 12, 2180, 47, 14908, 7985, 25, 123, 72, 5, 886, 7, 21, 1443, 3, 345, 23, 25, 1, 2257, 362, 4, 3331, 130, 30, 374, 2, 151, 1, 221, 1961, 4, 7, 5, 2180, 75, 3, 1605, 617, 1284, 2, 396, 99, 1608, 21, 108, 350, 11308, 140, 1, 2180, 4, 1776, 2, 886, 7, 59, 3, 2165, 1, 203, 2, 556, 60, 4, 1522, 1409, 1, 46, 49, 2039, 140, 42, 1325, 2180, 7, 11, 2320, 768, 6, 89, 1632, 1848, 30, 88, 784, 86, 30, 606, 2, 221, 156, 7163, 25, 10, 409, 252, 98, 2, 72, 20, 1047, 2, 1173, 20, 221, 156, 72, 5, 2556, 3850, 5, 2180, 42, 97, 142, 4487, 282, 360, 197, 168, 14, 175, 48, 307, 268, 58, 14, 1460, 14, 269, 19, 13, 144, 22, 205, 3850, 5, 1325, 2180, 168, 14, 167, 48, 58, 14, 680, 14, 462, 19, 13, 355, 4, 3, 331, 65, 392, 3331, 2, 30, 130, 11, 204, 6, 40, 1042, 41, 5, 25, 20, 1047, 141, 5152, 1, 5562, 2306, 2, 1078, 1, 979, 30, 88, 82, 2, 86, 606, 2, 221, 1961, 50, 1358, 9, 1540, 2, 30, 374, 221, 1961, 4, 7, 5, 1325, 2180, 42, 8, 93, 915, 5, 1047, 23, 63, 282, 19, 13, 355, 3850, 5, 1325, 2180, 11, 97, 299, 322, 6, 560, 152, 76, 2556, 641, 105, 335, 19, 13, 144, 2, 44, 357, 152, 10, 41, 5, 8, 97, 280, 63, 25, 168, 18, 874, 48, 58, 18, 556, 27, 755, 19, 13, 144, 8, 280, 116, 1, 152, 107, 3850, 5, 751, 1899, 12, 10, 41, 5, 8, 340, 25, 116, 198, 72, 6, 2556, 871, 198, 1358, 9, 867, 3331, 2, 30, 130, 46, 74, 538, 3, 594, 6, 380, 1539, 69, 2160, 6, 221, 24, 2, 3, 403, 8232, 364, 4, 484, 165]",1929.0,31108497,594
Financial toxicity risk among adult patients undergoing cancer surgery in the United States: An analysis of the National Inpatient Sample.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2019-06-24,"Financial hardship occurring as a result of cancer treatment has been termed financial toxicity and is an established side effect of the cancer treatment.

All uninsured and privately insured patients who underwent surgery for a gastrointestinal cancer were identified from the National Inpatient Sample. Publicly available government data were used estimate income, food expenditure, and average maximum out-of-pocket expenditure. Risk of financial toxicity was defined as health expenditure ≥ 40% of postsubsistence income. Among the 78 545 patients in the analytic cohort, 73 305 individuals had private insurance while 5240 patients were uninsured. Overall median hospital charges were $58 651 (IQR: $37 912-$95 379). Approximately 90% of uninsured and 10% of privately insured patients were at risk of financial toxicity. At the subpopulation level, patients in the lowest income quartile, undergoing emergency surgery, black or hispanic individuals, and those undergoing surgery for esophageal or colon cancer were more likely to experience catastrophic costs following surgery (P < .001).

Patterns of Life Lost to Cancers with High Risk of Death in China.,International journal of environmental research and public health,Int J Environ Res Public Health,2019-06-19,"To inform public health policy and research, we analyzed the patterns of life lost to cancers and evaluated the cancer burden in China. Based on the published Chinese Cancer Registry Annual Report and related literature in 2013, we calculated the cancer-related mortality and potential years of life lost (PYLL) by age, sex, districts (urban or rural), to describe the patterns of life lost to cancers. The high death-risk cancers in China were lung, liver, stomach, esophageal, colorectal, breast, pancreatic, brain and nervous system, and ovarian cancers, and leukemia. Liver and esophageal cancers were more prominent among males, while breast and colorectal cancers were more prevalent among females. The most obvious differences of mortality between urban and rural areas were found in liver, esophageal, and colorectal cancers. Cancer-related mortality increased significantly after the age of 30 years, and peaking at 70-79 years. The PYLL rate of cancer in urban areas was higher than that in rural areas (21.49 vs. 19.20/1000), and significant regional and gender differences of PYLL ranks can be observed. For people aged over 60 years, cancer PYLL mainly came from lung, stomach, and esophageal cancers; for middle-aged people, it was mainly induced by liver, colorectal, and female reproductive systems' cancers; and for those under 30 years, life lost to cancer was mainly caused by leukemia and brain, nervous system cancers.

The role of surgery in the management of oesophageal cancer.,The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2003-08-01,"In the absence of medical contraindications to surgery, resection is the mainstay of treatment for localised oesophageal cancer. Advancements in preoperative staging and imaging, anaesthesia delivery, surgical technique, and postoperative care, now enable the surgeon to safely operate on patients with oesophageal tumours and to tailor the procedure on the basis of performance status, tumour location, and extent of disease. During the past 10 years, several ""minimally invasive"" techniques, which aim to limit the extent of resection, have been introduced; these procedures are currently being investigated for use in both staging and treatment of oesophageal malignant diseases. Despite these accomplishments however, overall 5-year survival remains disappointing: less than 25% of patients live for 5 years after oesophagectomy. For patients with locally or regionally advanced disease (stage IIa, IIb, III, and IVa), combining several treatment approaches, either with or without surgery, can result in good objective responses and, in some patients, durable survival.

Oesophageal cancer: new developments in systemic therapy.,Cancer treatment reviews,Cancer Treat. Rev.,2003-12-01,"Oesophageal cancer is a rare but highly virulent malignancy in the United States and Western countries, and adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus has had the most rapid rate of increase of any solid tumour malignancy. Systemic metastatic disease is present in 50% of patients at diagnosis, and in the remaining 50% of patients presenting initially with loco-regional disease, systemic metastatic disease will develop in the vast majority of these patients. Combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy is the standard of care in the nonsurgical management of oesophageal cancer. Preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery continues to be actively studied in the surgical management of locally advanced oesophageal cancer. Pathologic complete responses are seen in 20-40% of patients, with five-year survival achieved in 25-35% of patients. The limited efficacy and substantial toxicity of conventional 5-FU-cisplatin-based chemotherapy combined with radiation, or used to treat advanced disease, has prompted the evaluation of newer agents, including the taxanes and irinotecan. These trials have indicated promising antitumour activity and therapy tolerance in both advanced disease and in combined modality therapy trials, depending on the dose and schedule of therapy administered.

The impact of complications on outcomes after resection for esophageal and gastroesophageal junction carcinoma.,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,J. Am. Coll. Surg.,2004-01-01,"Efforts to improve surgical outcomes have traditionally focused on improving preoperative patient selection and reducing the risk of postoperative medical complications. Strategies to optimize surgical technique have been less well studied. We sought to assess the relation between complications related to surgical technique and outcomes after esophagogastrectomy for cancer. Medical records of 510 consecutive patients undergoing esophagogastrectomy for invasive squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from 1996 to 2001 were reviewed. Data on diagnosis, stage of disease, therapies received, surgical approach, patient comorbidities, technical complications, and postoperative medical complications and outcomes including length of stay and overall survival were determined by one reviewer of the medical records. The primary predictor was surgical complications and the primary outcome was survival. Of the 150 patients studied 138 (27%) had complications directly attributable to surgical technique, such as an anastomotic leak, a paralyzed vocal cord, or chylothorax. At 3 years 43 of 138 patients (31%) with technical complications were alive, whereas 179 of 372 patients (48%) without technical complications were alive. Technical complications were associated with increased length of stay (median 23 days versus 11 days, p < 0.001), increased in-hospital mortality (12.3% versus 3.8%, p < 0.001), and a higher rate of medical complications (77.5% versus 47.3%, p < 0.001). After controlling for age, medical comorbidities, use of induction therapy, tumor stage, histology, and location, and completeness of resection the presence of a technical complication was highly predictive of poorer overall survival; the multivariable hazard ratio was 1.41 (1.22 to 1.63, p = 0.008).

A randomized controlled trial of darbepoetin alfa administered as a fixed or weight-based dose using a front-loading schedule in patients with anemia who have nonmyeloid malignancies.,Cancer,Cancer,2004-02-01,"The effect of using fixed versus weight-based doses for erythropoietic agents has not been reported previously. To investigate this issue, the authors conducted a randomized Phase II study of darbepoetin alfa administered as either a fixed dose or a weight-based dose using an accelerated correction and maintenance dosing regimen (front-loading). During the correction phase, patients with anemia (hemoglobin < 11.0 g/dL) who had nonmyeloid malignancies and who were receiving chemotherapy were given darbepoetin alfa at a fixed dose of 325 microg (n = 122) or at a weight-based dose of 4.5 microg/kg (n = 120) once weekly until they achieved a hemoglobin concentration > or = 12.0 g/dL. Patients then received darbepoetin alfa (325 microg or 4.5 microg/kg) once every 3 weeks for the remainder of the 16-week treatment period (maintenance phase). Darbepoetin alfa resulted in high Kaplan-Meier rates of hematopoietic response (> or = 2 g/dL increase from the baseline level or a hemoglobin level > or = 12 g/dL) in both the fixed-dose group (86%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 78- 94%) and the weight-based dose group (84%; 95% CI, 76-92%).

Hemoglobin concentrations were maintained at target levels for up to 16 weeks in both groups. Darbepoetin alfa was well tolerated, and no clinically significant differences between fixed doses and weight-based doses were observed.

Patients with advanced thoracic malignancies requiring full dose radiation received daily I.V. Topotecan prior to each daily session of XRT to 60 Gy over 6 weeks. Dose levels (and subjects studied at each) have been 0.2 (N=7), 0.3 (N=5), 0.4 (N=7), and 0.5mg/m(2) per day (N=5) in a best-of-five design. Tumor response was assessed at 4-8 weeks after completion of therapy. From March 1995 to December 1999, a total of 24 patients were treated.

A pilot study of high-dose intraarterial cisplatin chemotherapy with concomitant accelerated radiotherapy for patients with previously untreated T4 and selected patients with T3N0-N3M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract.,Cancer,Cancer,2005-02-01,"This Phase I clinical trial was developed to assess the feasibility of combining high-dose intraarterial cisplatin chemotherapy with concurrent, concomitant boost accelerated radiation therapy for patients with previously untreated T4 and select patients with T3N0-N3M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract. Between July 1999, and February 2002, 19 patients were treated with 3 or 4 weekly cycles of intraarterial Cisplatin chemotherapy (150 mg/m(2)) with concurrent, concomitant boost accelerated radiation therapy (72 grays in 42 fractions over 6 weeks). Two patient deaths occurred among the first 15 patients enrolled. Both patients presented with febrile neutropenia, and both died of complications related to infection. The number of cycles of intraarterial cisplatin was reduced from four cycles to three cycles, and an additional four patients were treated. The fourth patient treated on the modified protocol developed febrile neutropenia, sepsis, and a thromboembolic event, which resulted in lower extremity amputations. The maximum acute toxicity experienced was Grade 2 in 6 patients, Grade 3 in 5 patients, Grade 4 in 6 patients, and Grade 5 in 2 patients. With a median follow-up of 21 months (range, 6.2-34.6 months), the overall survival at 1 year was 89.5% (95% confidence interval [95%CI], 76.7-100%). At 1 year, 92.9% of the patients were free from disease progression (95%CI, 80.3-100%).

Intrathoracic leaks following esophagectomy are no longer associated with increased mortality.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2005-09-01,"Assess outcomes following intrathoracic leaks after esophagectomy from 1970 to 2004 to evaluate the impact of evolving surgical and perioperative techniques on leak-associated mortality (LAM). An intrathoracic leak following esophagectomy has historically been considered a catastrophic event, with mortality as high as 71%. Concerns about this complication often affect choice of surgical approach for esophagectomy. A retrospective review of all esophagectomies for cancer from 1970 to 2004 (n = 1223) was performed. Outcomes following intrathoracic anastomoses (n = 621) were analyzed by era: historical 1970-1986 (n = 145) and modern 1987-2004 (n = 476). There was no difference in the frequency of leak between the time intervals (4.8% versus 6.3%, P = 0.5). Despite a significant increase in the use of preoperative chemoradiation (1% versus 42%, P < 0.001) in the historical versus modern era, the overall mortality decreased from 11% to 2.5% (P < 0.001). The LAM was markedly reduced from 43% to 3.3% (P = 0.016). Factors associated with LAM included failure to use enteral nutrition (HR 13.22, CI 1.8-96.8) and era in which the surgery was performed (HR 18.3, 1.9-180). Other differences included an increased proportion of successful reoperations for leak control (11/30 versus 0/7, P = 0.08) and use of reinforcing muscle flaps (7/11). In the modern era, perioperative mortality is not significantly different for patients with or without intrathoracic leaks (3.3% versus 2.5%, P = 0.55), nor is long-term survival (P = 0.16). Modern surgical management of intrathoracic leaks results in no increased mortality and has no impact on long-term survival.

Mortality increases for octogenarians undergoing esophagogastrectomy for esophageal cancer.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2006-12-01,"As the general population ages, it becomes increasingly important to understand the potential contribution of chronologic age to mortality after esophagectomy. Because this risk is poorly defined, we sought to determine whether extreme age (>80 years) is an independent risk factor after esophagectomy. We analyzed a prospectively maintained, single-institution database of 858 consecutive patients who underwent esophagectomy between January 1996 and May 2005. Data evaluated included patient demographics, medical comorbidity, types of resections performed, length of stay, postoperative adverse events, and overall survival. We used univariate, multivariate, and Kaplan-Meier analysis to determine the influence of age on postoperative morbidity, in-hospital survival, and overall survival. Of 858 patients, 31 (10 female, 21 male) were older than 80 years of age. Preliminary analysis indicated that patients younger than 50 years (n = 107) had significantly fewer comorbidities; these were excluded from the analysis. In the remaining 751 patients, the age older than 80 cohort was compared with patients aged 50 to 79. Patients aged 50 to 79 were grouped because of similar characteristics (length of stay, hospital death). There were no significant differences in comorbidities, types of resections, or postoperative complication type or severity between the two groups. Postoperative death, length of stay, and survival, however, were significantly worse in patients older than 80.

A phase I trial of BMS-247550 (NSC# 710428) and gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumors.,Investigational new drugs,Invest New Drugs,2007-03-16,"The purpose of this study is to establish the maximum tolerated dose and define the dose-limiting toxicity of the investigational epothilone BMS-247550 in combination with fixed dose-rate gemcitabine. Patients with advanced, recurrent solid tumors who had received <or=2 prior cytotoxic regimens for recurrent disease were treated with gemcitabine over 90 min on days 1 and 8 plus BMS-247550 over 3 h on day 8, every 21 days in a phase I study. Dose-limiting toxicity definitions were based on severe myelosuppression, or grade 3 or 4 treatment-related non-hematologic toxicity, or dose delay of greater than 2 weeks due to treatment toxicity observed in the first treatment cycle. Dose cohort 1 received gemcitabine 900 mg/m2 and BMS-247550 20 mg/m2. Grade 4 neutropenia lasting >or=7 days occurred in one of six patients. Two of three patients in cohort 2 (gemcitabine 900 mg/m2 plus BMS-247550 30 mg/m2) had dose-limiting toxicities of grade 4 neutropenia. An additional three patients were treated at dose level 1 with no additional dose-limiting toxicities observed. At an intermediate dose level (gemcitabine 750 mg/m2 plus BMS-247550 30 mg/m2), two of six patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (febrile neutropenia and grade 3 hypophosphatemia in 1, grade 3 hypophosphatemia and grade 3 hyponatremia in (1), and five of six patients experienced dose delays. In the final cohort (gemcitabine 750 mg/m2 plus BMS-247550 25 mg/m2), two of two patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity. Treatment-related toxicities included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenic fever, hypophosphatemia, and hyponatremia. Nine of 14 patients evaluable for response had stable disease. The maximum tolerated dose for this schedule is gemcitabine 900 mg/m2 over 90 min days 1 and 8 plus BMS-247550 20 mg/m2 on day 8. Attempts to increase the dose of BMS-247550 by decreasing the gemcitabine dose did not sufficiently ameliorate myelosuppression.

The impact on survival of thromboembolic phenomena occurring before and during protocol chemotherapy in patients with advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2007-05-01,"Thromboembolic events (TEEs) are considered common in patients with gastroesophageal carcinoma, but their frequency at baseline and during chemotherapy is not known. Because prophylactic anticoagulation results in improved overall survival (OS) of solid tumor patients, the authors hypothesized that TEEs at baseline and during chemotherapy would have an adverse effect on OS. The authors analyzed patients with advanced gastroesophageal carcinoma who were treated on 4 prospective chemotherapy Phase II/III trials. Baseline and subsequent TEEs were documented and correlated with OS. On the 4 trials, 191 patients received single-agent or a combination of a taxane, camptothecin, platinum, or fluoropyrimidine. At baseline, TEEs occurred in 5.3% of untreated patients compared with 8.5% of previously treated patients (who had received prior treatment for metastatic disease). The median OS was only 3.9 months for patients who had a TEE at any time versus 8.7 months for patients who never developed a TEE (P = .007). TEEs at baseline were correlated with poor median OS in untreated patients (4.9 months vs 8.9 months for patients without a TEE; P = .014). There was no associated between TEEs and the type of chemotherapy used.

Endoscopic ultrasound predicts outcomes for patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction.,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,J. Am. Coll. Surg.,2007-07-20,"Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the most accurate locoregional staging tool for gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma, and it may allow pretreatment risk stratification. The purpose of this study was to compare preoperative EUS staging with postoperative pathologic staging and to assess the ability of EUS to predict survival after resection for GEJ adenocarcinoma. Patients with GEJ adenocarcinoma, who had preoperative staging with EUS followed by resection, were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy were excluded. EUS stage was compared with pathologic stage. Survival analyses were performed in patients who underwent complete gross resection. From 1985 through 2003, 209 patients underwent preoperative EUS followed by surgery without neoadjuvant therapy for GEJ adenocarcinoma. EUS correlated with pathologic T stage in 128 of 209 (61%) patients and with pathologic nodal stage in 154 of 206 (75%) patients. EUS accurately stratified patients into ""early"" (T0-2 N0) or ""advanced"" (T3-4 or N1) disease categories in 173 (83%) patients. Curative (R0) resection was performed in 184 patients: EUS ""early"" (n=84) and ""advanced"" (n=122) stages were associated with R0 rates of 100% and 82%, respectively (p=0.001).

Diverse TNFalpha-induced death pathways are enhanced by inhibition of NF-kappaB.,International journal of oncology,Int. J. Oncol.,2007-12-01,"TNFalpha was initially described as inducing necrotic death in tumors in vivo, and more recently as a cytokine that mediates cytoprotection and inflammation. The anti-tumor effects of TNFalpha are poorly characterized because TNFalpha-induced death of human tumor cells has largely been studied in the presence of agents that block transcription or protein synthesis. Also, most reports in model cell systems describe apoptosis within relatively early time points as the principal mode of cell death induced by TNFalpha. We investigated the cytotoxic effects of 10 ng/ml TNFalpha on human tumor cells of different histological types without concomitant exposure to these inhibitors. Eleven of 21 human tumor cell lines underwent TNFalpha-induced cell death which ranged from 41% to complete loss of viability. Only one cell line demonstrated caspase-dependent apoptosis within 24 h. Nine cell lines underwent death between 48 h and 21 days. Seven of these lines underwent caspase-3 independent death consistent with necrosis. One tumor line exhibited characteristics of senescence following TNFalpha exposure. Nine of 9 cell lines activated NF-kappaB following TNFalpha exposure by 24 h. In all cell lines studied, with the exception of the epidermoid carcinoma cell line that underwent early apoptosis, expression of one or more NF-kappaB target genes was demonstrated at 24-96 h.

"Optimizing docetaxel chemotherapy in patients with cancer of the gastric and gastroesophageal junction: evolution of the docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil regimen.",Cancer,Cancer,2008-09-01,"Advanced gastroesophageal cancer patients are often treated with systemic combination chemotherapy. The V-325 study demonstrated that adding docetaxel (D) to a frequently used regimen of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (CF) provided benefits with regard to overall survival, response rate, time-to-disease progression, clinical benefit, and health-related quality of life. Although the DCF regimen provides these advantages, it is accompanied by an increase in toxicity compared with the doublet regimen. The toxicity profile of DCF is acceptable only with appropriately selected patients and comprehensive toxicity management strategies. The objective of the current review was to identify trials that investigated modifications to the original DCF regimen to improve its toxicity profile and summarize response rate and toxicities. An attempt was also made to summarize ongoing modifications of the DCF regimen. MEDLINE, major meeting proceedings, and the government clinical trials website were searched until 2007. The modified DCF regimens appear to improve the toxicity profile when compared with the original DCF regimen. The docetaxel-based triplet combinations appear to have a higher response rate than the doublet combinations. Many institutions and cooperative groups continue to study docetaxel-based modifications of the DCF regimen to treat patients with gastroesophageal carcinoma.

Response to preoperative therapy in upper gastrointestinal cancers.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2009-02-05,"In cancer, a response to therapy implies a reduction in the volume or activity of localized and/or metastatic tumors. In localized upper gastrointestinal cancer, there is no accepted definition of clinical response; however, tumor shrinkage is frequently observed when preoperative therapy is administered. As patients with upper gastrointestinal cancers often undergo multimodal therapy, it is therefore imperative that new definitions for assessing the response to preoperative therapy be established. We reviewed the development of response criteria from a historical perspective, with particular emphasis on the criteria used to assess upper gastrointestinal cancers. Observing the response to preoperative therapy appears to make it possible to distinguish between favorable and unfavorable clinical biology in the cancer. Patients who experience a response to preoperative treatment appear to fare better in terms of overall survival than those whose cancers do not respond. We reviewed the published results regarding the response to preoperative therapy and the implications of this for patients.

"The higher the decrease in the standardized uptake value of positron emission tomography after chemoradiation, the better the survival of patients with gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.",Cancer,Cancer,2009-11-01,"Postchemoradiation percentage decrease in standardized uptake value (SUV) of positron emission tomography (PET) from baseline correlates with overall survival (OS) and pathologic response. Analyses of dichotomized data are commonly reported. The authors analyzed percentage SUV decrease as both dichotomized and continuous variables. The authors assessed 151 consecutive patients with gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma who had chemoradiation and surgery. Baseline and postchemoradiation PET/computed tomography imaging was performed. The log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards models were used to associate percentage SUV changes and OS, and logistic regression models were used to detect the association between percentage SUV changes and pathologic response. A >52% SUV decrease (dichotomized analysis) was associated with a longer OS (log-rank test, P = .023). The univariate Cox proportional hazards model indicated that greater percentage SUV decrease (as a continuous variable) was associated with a lower risk of death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.99; P = .01). Pathologic response (< or =50% residual cancer) was associated with longer OS (P = .003).

Validation and application of a module of the M. D.

Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) was developed as a brief yet comprehensive tool to assess patient-reported symptom severity and interference in patients with cancer. The authors report the development of an MDASI module for use in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) cancer (the MDASI-GI). Patients with GI cancer (N = 184) participated in module development and validation. The process included: 1) generating GI-specific candidate items with input from GI oncologists and from qualitative interviews with patients and adding those items to the core MDASI for testing; 2) dropping candidate GI items that lacked sensitivity; 3) validating the psychometric properties (validity, reliability, sensitivity) of the resulting MDASI-GI; and 4) conducting cognitive debriefing interviews with patients to confirm the questionnaire's ease of comprehension, relevance, and acceptability. Five GI-specific symptom items (constipation, diarrhea, difficulty swallowing, change in taste, and feeling bloated) were added to the original 19 MDASI symptom and interference items to form the MDASI-GI. Sixty-one percent of the sample had 1 or more moderate-to-severe symptom(s) (>or=5 on a severity scale from 0 to 10). Cronbach alpha values were .80 and .87 for symptom severity items and interference items, respectively. Known-group validity (sensitivity) was supported by the ability of the MDASI-GI to detect significant differences in symptom and interference levels according to performance status (P < .001). Cognitive debriefing demonstrated that, for patients, the MDASI-GI was an easy-to-use and understandable tool.

Correlation of local failure with measures of dose insufficiency in the high-dose single-fraction treatment of bony metastases.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2010-03-28,"In the setting of high-dose single-fraction image-guided radiotherapy of spine metastases, the delivered dose is hypothesized to be a significant factor in local control. We investigated the dependence of local control on measures of dose insufficiency. The minimum doses received by the hottest 100%, 98%, and 95% (D(min), D(98), and D(95)) of the gross target volume (GTV) were computed for 91 consecutively treated lesions observed in 79 patients. Prescribed doses of 18-24 Gy were delivered in a single fraction. The spinal cord and cauda equina were constrained to a maximum dose of 12-14 Gy and 16 Gy, respectively. A rank-sum test was used to assess the differences between radiographic local failure and local control. With a median follow-up of 18 months, seven local failures have occurred. The distributions of GTV D(min), D(98), and D(95) for treatments resulting in local failure were found to be statistically different from the corresponding distributions of the patient group as a whole. Taking no account of histology, p values calculated for D(min), D(98), and D(95) were 0.004, 0.012, and 0.031, respectively. No correlations between local failure and target volume or between local failure and anatomic location were found. The results indicate that D(min), D(98), and D(95) may be important risk factors for local failure.

Critical role of surgery in patients with gastroesophageal carcinoma with a poor prognosis after chemoradiation as defined by positron emission tomography.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-10-01,"The prognosis of patients with localized gastroesophageal carcinoma (LGC) can be defined after chemoradiation by the standardized uptake value (SUV) of positron emission tomography (PET). High SUV (HSUV) after chemoradiation portends a poor prognosis. The authors retrospectively examined the role of surgery in patients with HSUV after chemoradiation. The authors analyzed the postchemoradiation PET scans of 204 LGC patients. One hundred twenty-nine patients had HSUV. Two postchemoradiation variables were evaluated: SUV and surgery and their association with overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS). The log-rank test, multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, and Kaplan-Meier survival plots were used to assess the association between OS or EFS and the dichotomized SUV (using the median SUV as the cutoff) and surgery. The median SUV was 4.6. The OS of the 52 patients who had an SUV above the median and did not undergo surgery (HSUV-NS) (median OS, 1.22 years; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.02-2.16 years) was much shorter than that of the 77 patients with an SUV above the median who underwent surgery (HSUV-S) (median OS, 2.7 years; 95% CI, 2.43 years to not reached [P<.0001]). Similarly, the EFS for patients with HSUV-NS was significantly shorter than that for patients with HSUV-S (P=.001). In the multivariate analyses, patients who underwent surgery (irrespective of SUV) had a lower risk of death (P=.0001) and disease progression (P=.002). The data from the current study suggest that surgery may prolong OS and EFS in patients with a poor prognosis after chemoradiation as defined by PET.

"A phase 1 study of BMS-275183, a novel oral analogue of paclitaxel given on a daily schedule to patients with advanced malignancies.",Investigational new drugs,Invest New Drugs,2010-08-03,"BMS-275183 is an oral C-4 methyl carbonate analogue of paclitaxel that has the same mechanism of action, stabilization of tubulin polymerization. The present study was designed to: (i) assess the safety and tolerability of BMS-275183, and (ii) determine a suitable Phase II dose of BMS-275183 when given on a continuous daily schedule to patients with advanced solid tumor(s). This was a multi-institutional, open-label, Phase I, single-arm dose escalation study in which cohorts of eligible patients with advanced malignancies were treated with BMS-275183 orally on a continuous daily schedule. The starting dose level was 6 mg/m(2)/day administered once daily. Cohorts of 3 patients were treated at each dose level provided no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed. Each cycle of treatment lasted 28 days. Twenty patients were enrolled in dose cohorts ranging from the initial dose level of 6 mg/m(2)/day to 18 mg/m(2)/day. Overall, the most frequent (>20% of patients) treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were nausea (40%), constipation (20%), diarrhea (20%), and fatigue (20%). There were 2 fatal events of neutropenic sepsis one each at the 15 mg/m(2)/day and 18 mg/m(2)/day dose level, respectively. There were no objective responses; 4 of 20 patients experienced stable disease. Pharmacokinetic data indicated no clear correlation between dose and exposure following daily oral administration of BMS-275183 doses between 6 and 18 mg/m(2). Substantial inter-patient variability was observed, and high drug exposure was associated with fatal neutropenic sepsis. BMS-275183 is a novel oral analogue of paclitaxel with high inter-patient variability in exposure. The lack of evidence of clinical benefit and the occurrence of two fatal events of neutropenic sepsis, coupled with high drug exposure, argues against further evaluation of BMS-275183 on a daily dosing schedule.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",3458.0,14.0,BMS-275183 is an oral C-4 methyl carbonate analogue of paclitaxel that has the same mechanism of action stabilization of tubulin polymerization The present study was designed to i assess the safety and tolerability of BMS-275183 and ii determine a suitable Phase II dose of BMS-275183 when given on a continuous daily schedule to patients with advanced solid tumor s This was a multi-institutional open-label Phase I single-arm dose escalation study in which cohorts of eligible patients with advanced malignancies were treated with BMS-275183 orally on a continuous daily schedule The starting dose level was 6 mg/m 2 /day administered once daily Cohorts of 3 patients were treated at each dose level provided no dose-limiting toxicities DLTs were observed Each cycle of treatment lasted 28 days Twenty patients were enrolled in dose cohorts ranging from the initial dose level of 6 mg/m 2 /day to 18 mg/m 2 /day Overall the most frequent 20 of patients treatment-related adverse events AEs were nausea 40 constipation 20 diarrhea 20 and fatigue 20 There were 2 fatal events of neutropenic sepsis one each at the 15 mg/m 2 /day and 18 mg/m 2 /day dose level respectively There were no objective responses 4 of 20 patients experienced stable disease Pharmacokinetic data indicated no clear correlation between dose and exposure following daily oral administration of BMS-275183 doses between 6 and 18 mg/m 2 Substantial inter-patient variability was observed and high drug exposure was associated with fatal neutropenic sepsis BMS-275183 is a novel oral analogue of paclitaxel with high inter-patient variability in exposure The lack of evidence of clinical benefit and the occurrence of two fatal events of neutropenic sepsis coupled with high drug exposure argues against further evaluation of BMS-275183 on a daily dosing schedule,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[3502, 21454, 16, 35, 518, 256, 39, 5228, 21962, 4696, 1, 490, 17, 71, 3, 827, 670, 1, 1578, 3184, 1, 5303, 12273, 3, 364, 45, 10, 1114, 6, 70, 423, 3, 367, 2, 1543, 1, 3502, 21454, 2, 215, 223, 8, 2884, 124, 215, 61, 1, 3502, 21454, 198, 447, 23, 8, 1314, 391, 1055, 6, 7, 5, 131, 537, 30, 695, 26, 10, 8, 1414, 1115, 1020, 1756, 124, 70, 226, 475, 61, 1125, 45, 4, 92, 736, 1, 625, 7, 5, 131, 441, 11, 73, 5, 3502, 21454, 1428, 23, 8, 1314, 391, 1055, 3, 1723, 61, 301, 10, 49, 81, 188, 18, 218, 468, 1059, 391, 736, 1, 27, 7, 11, 73, 28, 296, 61, 301, 1052, 77, 61, 817, 385, 2506, 11, 164, 296, 417, 1, 24, 6854, 339, 162, 737, 7, 11, 346, 4, 61, 736, 2223, 29, 3, 388, 61, 301, 1, 49, 81, 188, 18, 218, 6, 203, 81, 188, 18, 218, 63, 3, 96, 908, 179, 1, 7, 24, 139, 290, 281, 1477, 11, 1218, 327, 4532, 179, 1172, 179, 2, 613, 179, 125, 11, 18, 3034, 281, 1, 3659, 4227, 104, 296, 28, 3, 167, 81, 188, 18, 218, 2, 203, 81, 188, 18, 218, 61, 301, 106, 125, 11, 77, 461, 253, 39, 1, 179, 7, 592, 585, 34, 1456, 74, 1103, 77, 885, 816, 59, 61, 2, 645, 366, 391, 518, 634, 1, 3502, 21454, 415, 59, 49, 2, 203, 81, 188, 18, 1281, 3606, 69, 1982, 10, 164, 2, 64, 234, 645, 10, 41, 5, 3034, 3659, 4227, 3502, 21454, 16, 8, 229, 518, 4696, 1, 490, 5, 64, 3606, 69, 1982, 4, 645, 3, 926, 1, 241, 1, 38, 247, 2, 3, 2291, 1, 100, 3034, 281, 1, 3659, 4227, 3332, 5, 64, 234, 645, 14473, 480, 195, 451, 1, 3502, 21454, 23, 8, 391, 1280, 1055]",,20680660,304
Exploring the feasibility of dose escalation positron emission tomography-positive disease with intensity-modulated radiation therapy and the effects on normal tissue structures for thoracic malignancies.,Medical dosimetry : official journal of the American Association of Medical Dosimetrists,Med Dosim,2010-12-08,"The pattern of failure is one of the major causes of mortality among thoracic patients. Studies have shown a correlation between local control and dose. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has resulted in conformal dose distributions while limiting dose to normal tissue. However, thoracic malignancies treated with IMRT to highly conformal doses up to 70 Gy still have been found to fail. Thus, the need for dose escalation through simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) may prove effective in minimizing reoccurrences. For our study, 28 thoracic IMRT plans were reoptimized via dose escalation to the gross tumor volume (GTV) and planning target volume (PTV) of 79.2 Gy and 68.4 Gy, respectively. Reoccurrences in surrounding regions of microscopic disease are rare therefore, dose-escalating regional nodes (outside GTV) were not included.

Treatment of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma with adjuvant or definitive intensity-modulated radiation therapy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2011-04-29,"The optimal management of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) typically involves surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in the setting of adverse pathologic features. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is frequently used to treat oral cavity cancers, but published IMRT outcomes specific to this disease site are sparse. We report the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute experience with IMRT-based treatment for OCSCC. Retrospective study of all patients treated at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute for OCSCC with adjuvant or definitive IMRT between August 2004 and December 2009. The American Joint Committee on Cancer disease stage criteria distribution of this cohort included 5 patients (12%) with stage I; 10 patients (24%) with stage II (n = 10, 24%); 14 patients (33%) with stage III (n = 14, 33%); and 13 patients (31%) with stage IV. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints were locoregional control (LRC) and acute and chronic toxicity. Forty-two patients with OCSCC were included, 30 of whom were initially treated with surgical resection. Twenty-three (77%) of 30 surgical patients treated with adjuvant IMRT also received concurrent chemotherapy, and 9 of 12 (75%) patients treated definitively without surgery were treated with CRT or induction chemotherapy and CRT. With a median follow-up of 2.1 years (interquartile range, 1.1-3.1 years) for all patients, the 2-year actuarial rates of OS and LRC following adjuvant IMRT were 85% and 91%, respectively, and the comparable results for definitive IMRT were 63% and 64% for OS and LRC, respectively. Only 1 patient developed symptomatic osteoradionecrosis, and among patients without evidence of disease, 35% experienced grade 2 to 3 late dysphagia, with only 1 patient who was continuously gastrostomy-dependent. In this single-institution series, postoperative IMRT was associated with promising LRC, OS, and lower late toxicity rates, and chemoradiotherapy was a successful treatment for patients with high-risk disease. In contrast, outcomes of radiation-based treatment for patients with inoperable locally advanced disease were markedly less successful.",Journal Article,3189.0,39.0,The optimal management of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma OCSCC typically involves surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy CRT in the setting of adverse pathologic features Intensity-modulated radiation therapy IMRT is frequently used to treat oral cavity cancers but published IMRT outcomes specific to this disease site are sparse We report the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute experience with IMRT-based treatment for OCSCC Retrospective study of all patients treated at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute for OCSCC with adjuvant or definitive IMRT between August 2004 and December 2009 The American Joint Committee on Cancer disease stage criteria distribution of this cohort included 5 patients 12 with stage I 10 patients 24 with stage II n 10 24 14 patients 33 with stage III n 14 33 and 13 patients 31 with stage IV The primary endpoint was overall survival OS secondary endpoints were locoregional control LRC and acute and chronic toxicity Forty-two patients with OCSCC were included 30 of whom were initially treated with surgical resection Twenty-three 77 of 30 surgical patients treated with adjuvant IMRT also received concurrent chemotherapy and 9 of 12 75 patients treated definitively without surgery were treated with CRT or induction chemotherapy and CRT With a median follow-up of 2.1 years interquartile range 1.1-3.1 years for all patients the 2-year actuarial rates of OS and LRC following adjuvant IMRT were 85 and 91 respectively and the comparable results for definitive IMRT were 63 and 64 for OS and LRC respectively Only 1 patient developed symptomatic osteoradionecrosis and among patients without evidence of disease 35 experienced grade 2 to 3 late dysphagia with only 1 patient who was continuously gastrostomy-dependent In this single-institution series postoperative IMRT was associated with promising LRC OS and lower late toxicity rates and chemoradiotherapy was a successful treatment for patients with high-risk disease In contrast outcomes of radiation-based treatment for patients with inoperable locally advanced disease were markedly less successful,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[3, 665, 284, 1, 518, 2405, 691, 31, 134, 11225, 1969, 2921, 221, 170, 370, 20, 249, 310, 15, 1464, 1089, 4, 3, 546, 1, 290, 510, 404, 837, 1757, 121, 36, 964, 16, 746, 95, 6, 943, 518, 2405, 163, 84, 983, 964, 123, 112, 6, 26, 34, 606, 32, 7425, 21, 414, 3, 4932, 4979, 12, 1377, 730, 5, 964, 90, 24, 9, 11225, 459, 45, 1, 62, 7, 73, 28, 4932, 4979, 12, 1377, 9, 11225, 5, 249, 15, 1057, 964, 59, 2480, 1131, 2, 1397, 1238, 3, 597, 2093, 2002, 23, 12, 34, 82, 371, 1395, 1, 26, 180, 159, 33, 7, 133, 5, 82, 70, 79, 7, 259, 5, 82, 215, 78, 79, 259, 213, 7, 466, 5, 82, 316, 78, 213, 466, 2, 233, 7, 456, 5, 82, 478, 3, 86, 1138, 10, 63, 25, 118, 568, 1387, 11, 1325, 182, 4000, 2, 286, 2, 442, 155, 1213, 100, 7, 5, 11225, 11, 159, 201, 1, 953, 11, 1625, 73, 5, 221, 170, 737, 169, 849, 1, 201, 221, 7, 73, 5, 249, 964, 120, 103, 750, 56, 2, 83, 1, 133, 481, 7, 73, 6008, 187, 152, 11, 73, 5, 1089, 15, 504, 56, 2, 1089, 5, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 18, 14, 60, 2899, 184, 14, 14, 27, 14, 60, 9, 62, 7, 3, 18, 111, 2361, 151, 1, 118, 2, 4000, 366, 249, 964, 11, 772, 2, 970, 106, 2, 3, 1279, 99, 9, 1057, 964, 11, 676, 2, 660, 9, 118, 2, 4000, 106, 158, 14, 69, 276, 1704, 19160, 2, 107, 7, 187, 241, 1, 34, 465, 592, 88, 18, 6, 27, 807, 4561, 5, 158, 14, 69, 54, 10, 4285, 6983, 470, 4, 26, 226, 731, 988, 573, 964, 10, 41, 5, 721, 4000, 118, 2, 280, 807, 155, 151, 2, 1464, 10, 8, 1401, 24, 9, 7, 5, 64, 43, 34, 4, 748, 123, 1, 121, 90, 24, 9, 7, 5, 3874, 795, 131, 34, 11, 2195, 299, 1401]",,21531515,362
RON (MST1R) is a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.,Cancer biology & therapy,Cancer Biol. Ther.,2011-07-01,"RON (MST1R) is one of two members of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase family, along with parent receptor MET. RON has a putative role in several cancers, but its expression and function is poorly characterized in gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. A recognized functional role of MET tyrosine kinase in gastroesophageal cancer has led to early phase clinical trials using MET inhibitors, with unimpressive results. Therefore, the role of RON in gastroesophageal cancer, as well as its role in cooperative signaling with MET and as a mechanism of resistance to MET inhibition, was studied in gastroesophageal tissues and cell lines. By IHC, RON was highly over-expressed in 74% of gastroesophageal samples (n=94), and over-expression was prognostic of poor survival (p=0.008); RON and MET co-expression occurred in 43% of samples and was prognostic of worst survival (p=0.03). High MST1R gene copy number by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization and/or array comparative genomic hybridization, was seen in 35.5% (16/45) of cases. High MST1R gene copy number correlated with poor survival (p=0.01), and was associated with high MET and ERBB2 gene copy number. A novel somatic MST1R juxtamembrane mutation R1018G was found in 11% of samples. RON signaling was functional in cell lines, activating downstream effector STAT3, and resulted in increased viability over controls. RON and MET co-stimulation assays led to enhanced malignant phenotypes over stimulation of either receptor alone. Growth inhibition as evidenced by viability and apoptosis assays was optimal using novel blocking monoclonal antibodies to both RON and MET, versus either alone. SU11274, a classic MET small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocked signaling of both receptors, and proved synergistic when combined with STAT3 inhibition (combination index < 1). These preclinical studies define RON as an important novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for gastroesophageal cancer warranting further investigation.",Journal Article,3126.0,60.0,RON MST1R is one of two members of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase family along with parent receptor MET RON has a putative role in several cancers but its expression and function is poorly characterized in gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma A recognized functional role of MET tyrosine kinase in gastroesophageal cancer has led to early phase clinical trials using MET inhibitors with unimpressive results Therefore the role of RON in gastroesophageal cancer as well as its role in cooperative signaling with MET and as a mechanism of resistance to MET inhibition was studied in gastroesophageal tissues and cell lines By IHC RON was highly over-expressed in 74 of gastroesophageal samples n=94 and over-expression was prognostic of poor survival p=0.008 RON and MET co-expression occurred in 43 of samples and was prognostic of worst survival p=0.03 High MST1R gene copy number by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization and/or array comparative genomic hybridization was seen in 35.5 16/45 of cases High MST1R gene copy number correlated with poor survival p=0.01 and was associated with high MET and ERBB2 gene copy number A novel somatic MST1R juxtamembrane mutation R1018G was found in 11 of samples RON signaling was functional in cell lines activating downstream effector STAT3 and resulted in increased viability over controls RON and MET co-stimulation assays led to enhanced malignant phenotypes over stimulation of either receptor alone Growth inhibition as evidenced by viability and apoptosis assays was optimal using novel blocking monoclonal antibodies to both RON and MET versus either alone SU11274 a classic MET small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor blocked signaling of both receptors and proved synergistic when combined with STAT3 inhibition combination index 1 These preclinical studies define RON as an important novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for gastroesophageal cancer warranting further investigation,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[5877, 29632, 16, 104, 1, 100, 1684, 1, 3, 543, 153, 564, 216, 607, 1510, 5, 3841, 153, 543, 5877, 71, 8, 2743, 200, 4, 392, 163, 84, 211, 55, 2, 343, 16, 1240, 765, 4, 3227, 449, 8, 1904, 583, 200, 1, 543, 564, 216, 4, 3227, 12, 71, 836, 6, 191, 124, 38, 143, 75, 543, 222, 5, 34190, 99, 673, 3, 200, 1, 5877, 4, 3227, 12, 22, 149, 22, 211, 200, 4, 1690, 314, 5, 543, 2, 22, 8, 670, 1, 251, 6, 543, 297, 10, 656, 4, 3227, 742, 2, 31, 285, 20, 1289, 5877, 10, 561, 252, 570, 4, 794, 1, 3227, 347, 78, 960, 2, 252, 55, 10, 177, 1, 334, 25, 19, 13, 2155, 5877, 2, 543, 1269, 55, 489, 4, 601, 1, 347, 2, 10, 177, 1, 4066, 25, 19, 13, 680, 64, 29632, 145, 1337, 207, 20, 1156, 1451, 1260, 1329, 2, 557, 20, 1591, 4, 957, 1554, 2, 15, 1926, 2352, 572, 1554, 10, 527, 4, 465, 33, 245, 512, 1, 140, 64, 29632, 145, 1337, 207, 438, 5, 334, 25, 19, 13, 355, 2, 10, 41, 5, 64, 543, 2, 2186, 145, 1337, 207, 8, 229, 1119, 29632, 10541, 258, 76671, 10, 204, 4, 175, 1, 347, 5877, 314, 10, 583, 4, 31, 285, 1616, 1489, 2070, 1439, 2, 627, 4, 101, 2120, 252, 535, 5877, 2, 543, 1269, 2503, 1013, 836, 6, 651, 393, 2618, 252, 2503, 1, 361, 153, 279, 129, 297, 22, 4728, 20, 2120, 2, 351, 1013, 10, 665, 75, 229, 2521, 848, 890, 6, 110, 5877, 2, 543, 185, 361, 279, 11496, 8, 3168, 543, 302, 1354, 564, 216, 230, 2582, 314, 1, 110, 1186, 2, 4328, 1806, 198, 397, 5, 1439, 297, 150, 558, 14, 46, 693, 94, 1107, 5877, 22, 35, 305, 229, 177, 952, 2, 189, 283, 9, 3227, 12, 7643, 195, 940]",,21543897,285
Advanced gastroesophageal carcinoma: an update on the current therapeutic landscape.,Onkologie,Onkologie,2012-03-15,"Gastroesophageal cancers are usually diagnosed in an advanced stage, and effective treatment options remain limited. The discovery of new drugs to treat these diseases has been slow for decades. An occasional favorable outcome, trastuzumab, in patients with HER2 protein-overexpressing tumors, is welcome but not sufficient. For advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (AGC), fluoropyrimidines (given orally or intravenously) plus a platinum compound (usually cisplatin) have been accepted as a global reference to streamline new drug development. The addition of a third cytotoxic (docetaxel or epirubicin) can produce modest prolongation of overall survival. In some European countries, the irinotecanbased regimen is considered as an alternative to platinum-based first-line therapy. Selecting a safe, effective, and convenient regimen is desirable and is the focus of current research. Additionally, it appears that survival differences by regions (e.g., Asians survive longer compared to Western and South American patients) are likely due to second- and third-line therapies, differences in tumor biology, or unknown reasons. Future progress could come from 1 of 2 approaches: (1) conducting many empiric phase III trials in unselected patients or (2) through detailed studies of molecular biology to develop rational therapies.

A nomogram associated with high probability of malignant nodes in the surgical specimen after trimodality therapy of patients with oesophageal cancer.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",Eur. J. Cancer,2012-07-31,"The presence of malignant lymph nodes (+ypNodes) in the surgical specimen after preoperative chemoradiation (trimodality) in patients with oesophageal cancer (EC) portends a poor prognosis for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Currently, none of the clinical variables highly correlates with +ypNodes. We hypothesised that a combination of clinical variables could generate a model that associates with high likelihood of +ypNodes after trimodality in EC patients. We report on 293 consecutive EC patients who received trimodality therapy. A multivariate logistic regression analysis that included pretreatment and post-chemoradiation variables identified independent variables that were used to construct a nomogram for +ypNodes after trimodality in EC patients. Of 293 patients, 91 (31.1%) had +ypNodes. OS (p=0.0002) and DFS (p<0.0001) were shorter in patients with +ypNodes compared to those with -ypNodes. In multivariable analysis, the significant variables for +ypNodes were: baseline T-stage (odds ratio [OR], 7.145; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.381-36.969; p=0.019), baseline N-stage (OR, 2.246; 95% CI, 1.024-4.926; p=0.044), tumour length (OR, 1.178; 95% CI, 1.024-1.357; p=0.022), induction chemotherapy (OR, 0.471; 95% CI, 0.242-0.915; p=0.026), nodal uptake on post-chemoradiation positron emission tomography (OR, 2.923; 95% CI, 1.007-8.485; p=0.049) and enlarged node(s) on post-chemoradiation computerised tomography (OR, 3.465; 95% CI, 1.549-7.753; p=0.002). The nomogram after internal validation using the bootstrap method (200 runs) yielded a high concordance index of 0.756.

"Combined thoracoscopic and laparoscopic robotic-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy using a four-arm platform: experience, technique and cautions during early procedure development.",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,2013-01-30,"This study reports an early, single-institution experience of combined thoracoscopic and laparoscopic robotic-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) using a four-arm robotic platform, with special attention given to the pitfalls and complications during procedure development. We conducted a prospective, single-cohort, observational study of patients undergoing RAMIE at a single institution. A total of 21 patients (median age, 62 years [range, 37-83 years]) underwent RAMIE with a four-arm robotic platform (17 by Ivor Lewis and 4 by McKeown). Of the patients, 17 (81%) had a complete (R0) resection, and 16 (76%) received induction treatment, the majority (14/21 [67%]) with combined chemoradiation. The median operative time was 556 min (range, 395-807 min), which decreased to 414 min (range, 405-543 min) for the last 5 cases in the series. The median estimated blood loss was 307 cm(3) (range, 200-500 cm(3)), and the median length of hospital stay was 10 days (range, 7-70 days). The median number of lymph nodes resected was 20 (range, 10-49). Five (24%) patients were converted to open procedures. Five patients (24%) had major complications. One (5%) died of complications on postoperative Day 70, and 3 (14%) had clinically significant anastomotic leaks (Grade II or greater, by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0). Three patients (14%) in this early experience developed airway fistulas. While four-arm RAMIE may offer advantages over standard minimally invasive esophagectomy approaches, its adoption in a structured program, with critical evaluation of adverse events and subsequent adjustment of technique, is paramount to maximize patient safety, minimize complications and improve the conduct of operation early in the learning curve.

CD117 expression in operable oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas predicts worse clinical outcome.,Histopathology,Histopathology,2013-04-09,"To investigate the aberrant expression of CD117 in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and its prognostic significance. Immunohistochemical staining for CD117 was performed on tissue microarray and routine tissue sections from 157 oesophageal SCC patients and 10 normal oesophageal epithelia adjacent to tumour. The positive rate of CD117 expression was 29.9% in oesophageal SCC tissues, whereas no CD117 expression was detected in the 10 normal oesophageal epithelia. CD117 expression was significantly associated with T stage (P < 0.001), distant metastasis (P = 0.015), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.019), and clinical stage (P = 0.021). Progression-free survival in the patients with CD117-positive tumours was shorter than that in the patients with CD117-negative tumours (P = 0.010). In univariate analyses, CD117 expression was the most significant factor for overall survival of oesophageal SCC patients (P < 0.001), followed by lymph node metastasis (P = 0.001), T stage (P = 0.002), clinical stage (P = 0.006), distant metastasis (P = 0.020), and histological grade (P = 0.027). Multivariate analyses verified that CD117 expression was an independent prognostic marker for oesophageal SCC patients (P = 0.002). In addition, CD117 expression predicted poorer survival in patients without distant metastases.

Emerging tyrosine kinase inhibitors for esophageal cancer.,Expert opinion on emerging drugs,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs,2013-06-01,"Because of the poor prognosis for patients with esophagogastric cancers (EGCs), increasing attention has focused on targeted agents. Targets include epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Her2, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and MET. We briefly discuss preclinical data and the rationale for targeting these pathways and summarize the results of clinical trials of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) against these targets. While anti-EGFR therapy has been extensively investigated, completed Phase III trials suggest that this is not a promising target. A Phase III trial of an anti-VEGF antibody failed to show improvement in the primary endpoint of overall survival but response rates and progression-free survival were improved; a Phase III trial of an anti-VEGF receptor 2 antibody in second-line therapy did show improved survival. As such, Phase II and III evaluations of anti-VEGF TKIs are ongoing.

Clinical outcomes associated with evolving treatment modalities and radiation techniques for base-of-tongue carcinoma: thirty years of institutional experience.,Cancer medicine,Cancer Med,2015-01-26,"Curative treatment for base-of-tongue squamous cell carcinoma (BOT SCC) has evolved over time; however, comparative outcomes analysis for various treatment strategies is lacking. The authors reviewed the evolution of treatment modality and radiotherapy (RT) technique for 231 consecutive BOT SCC patients at our institution between 1981 and 2011. Treatment modalities included definitive chemoradiotherapy (chemoRT) (42%), definitive RT (33%), surgery followed by RT (20%), and surgery alone (5%). RT techniques included external beam plus interstitial brachytherapy (EBRT + IB) (37%), conventional EBRT (29%), intensity-modulated radiation therapy ± simultaneous integrated boost (IMRT ± SIB) (34%). Clinical characteristics and outcomes were stratified by modality or RT technique. Treatment modality evolved from definitive RT (1980s-1990s) to definitive chemoRT (1990s-2000s). RT technique evolved from EBRT + IB (1980s-1990s) to conventional EBRT (1990s-2000s) to IMRT + SIB (2000s). With median alive follow-up of 6 years (0.3-28 years), the 5-year LC, LRC, and OS rates were 80%, 73%, and 51%. There was no difference in distribution of gender, age, stage among treatment modalities. Definitive chemoRT had improved LRC (HR 1.6) and OS (HR 1.7) compared to definitive RT.

Thirty-one patients with histologically proven adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus, fit for trimodality therapy were prospectively enrolled. Most were men (93.5%), and had a stage III cancer (74.2%). Chemotherapy consisted of oxaliplatin/5-fluorouracil (45.2%) and taxane/5-fluorouracil (54.8%). All patients underwent a baseline, an interim (performed 12 ± 2 days after the onset of CTRT) and a post-CTRT 18F-FDG PET/CT study. The 18F-FDG PET/CT variables evaluated were at baseline, interim and post-CTRT studies maximum standardised uptake value (SUV max) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG). Clinical and 18F-FDG PET/CT parameters were correlated with pathologic complete response (pathCR) and OS. Among the 31 patients studied, 61.3% achieved a clinical complete response (cCR) and 87.1% had surgery. The median OS was 35.1 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 19.9-NA). PathCR rate was 22.2%.

"Phase I Dose-Escalation and Pharmacokinetic Study of Intravenous Aflibercept in Combination with Docetaxel, Cisplatin, and 5-Fluorouracil in Patients with Advanced Solid Malignancies.",Oncology,Oncology,2015-10-23,"This phase I study (EudraCT No. 2006-001177-25) investigated aflibercept, a vascular endothelial growth factor decoy receptor protein (VEGF Trap), in combination with docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients received 2, 4, or 6 mg/kg of intravenous aflibercept with docetaxel 75 mg/m2, cisplatin 75 mg/m2, and 5-fluorouracil 750 mg/m2 in 3-week cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary objectives were to evaluate dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during cycle 1 and to determine the recommended phase II dose. Pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and antitumor activity were also investigated. Forty-four patients were enrolled and treated (29 patients in a dose-escalation phase and 15 patients in an expansion cohort). Following three cases of febrile neutropenia in patients receiving aflibercept at 4 mg/kg, the protocol was amended to allow earlier granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support (from day 6) and prophylactic use of ciprofloxacin. Subsequently, there were two DLTs: febrile neutropenia (2 mg/kg) and grade 4 pulmonary embolism (6 mg/kg). An excess of free over VEGF-bound aflibercept was observed at 6 mg/kg. The most frequent grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) were neutropenia (54.5%), lymphopenia (47.7%), and stomatitis (38.6%). AEs associated with VEGF blockade (any grade) included epistaxis (61.4%), dysphonia (40.9%), hypertension (38.6%), and proteinuria (11.4%).

Long-Term Survival in Patients with Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer Treated with Preoperative Therapy: Do Thoracic and Abdominal Approaches Differ?,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2015-11-12,"The optimal surgical approach for gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer treated with preoperative therapy remains controversial. We compared the outcomes of patients who underwent either esophagectomy or gastrectomy and identified variables associated with overall survival (OS). We reviewed records of patients with Siewert types II and III GEJ adenocarcinoma who were treated with preoperative therapy followed by resection from 1995 to 2013. OS was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and associated variables were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models. Of 143 patients, 110 (76.9 %) had type II and 33 (23.1 %) had type III tumors. Most (86 %) patients had stage T3 or T4 disease, and more than half had N+ (62 %) disease. The majority (93 %) received neoadjuvant chemoradiation; 7 % received chemotherapy alone. Patients with type II tumors underwent either esophagectomy (75 %) or gastrectomy (25 %). Patients with type III tumors primarily underwent gastrectomy (88 %). Eighty-six (60 %) patients underwent extended (D1+/D2) abdominal lymphadenectomy. We saw no differences between esophagectomy and gastrectomy patients in R0 resection rate (94 vs. 95 %; p = 0.9), number of nodes removed (mean, 18.3 vs. 19.3; p = 0.6), or 60-day mortality rate (4 vs. 4 %; p = 1.0). The median follow-up period for survivors was 65 months. Esophagectomy and gastrectomy showed similar 5-year OS rates (49 vs. 53 %; p = 0.8). Surgical approach was not associated with OS [hazard ratio (HR) 1.30; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.68-2.45; p = 0.43]. The strongest predictor of OS was extended lymphadenectomy (HR 0.55; 95 % CI, 0.32-0.94; p = 0.03).

Eligible patients with metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma received standard-dose mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy in combination with escalating doses of everolimus. Six patients were accrued to the first dose level of 2.5 mg everolimus daily with mFOLFOX6. Overall, the toxicity profile was manageable with expected grade 3 toxicities of mucositis and neutropenia. The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) included a week delay in therapy greater than 7 days as a result of the first 2 courses of mFOLFOX6. Two patients experienced DLTs at the first dose level due to delays in their treatment caused by prolonged grade 2 neutropenia and fever with fatigue. They were allowed to continue with a dose reduction of their chemotherapy. The median overall survival and progression-free survival were 20.3 and 14.5 months, respectively.

Agreement between physicians was calculated with an expectation minimization algorithm using simultaneous truth and performance level estimation with κ statistics. Target volume definition guidelines were established by finding optimized confidence level consensus contours using histogram agreement analyses. Nine expert radiation oncologists and 1 neurosurgeon completed contours for all 10 cases. The mean sensitivity and specificity were 0.79 (range, 0.71-0.89) and 0.94 (range, 0.90-0.99) for the CTV and 0.79 (range, 0.70-0.95) and 0.92 (range, 0.87-0.99) for the PTV), respectively. Mean κ agreement, which demonstrates the probability that contours agree by chance alone, was 0.58 (range, 0.43-0.70) for CTV and 0.58 (range, 0.37-0.76) for PTV (P<.001 for all cases). Optimized consensus contours were established for all patients with 80% confidence interval. Recommendations for CTV include treatment of the entire preoperative extent of bony and epidural disease, plus immediately adjacent bony anatomic compartments at risk of microscopic disease extension. In particular, a ""donut-shaped"" CTV was consistently applied in cases of preoperative circumferential epidural extension, regardless of extent of residual epidural extension. Otherwise more conformal anatomic-based CTVs were determined and described. Spinal instrumentation was consistently excluded from the CTV.

Hnf4α is a key gene that can generate columnar metaplasia in oesophageal epithelium.,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,Differentiation,2016-11-19,"Barrett's metaplasia is the only known morphological precursor to oesophageal adenocarcinoma and is characterized by replacement of stratified squamous epithelium by columnar epithelium. The cell of origin is uncertain and the molecular mechanisms responsible for the change in cellular phenotype are poorly understood. We therefore explored the role of two transcription factors, Cdx2 and HNF4α in the conversion using primary organ cultures. Biopsy samples from cases of human Barrett's metaplasia were analysed for the presence of CDX2 and HNF4α. A new organ culture system for adult murine oesophagus is described. Using this, Cdx2 and HNF4α were ectopically expressed by adenoviral infection. The phenotype following infection was determined by a combination of PCR, immunohistochemical and morphological analyses. We demonstrate the expression of CDX2 and HNF4α in human biopsy samples. Our oesophageal organ culture system expressed markers characteristic of the normal SSQE: p63, K14, K4 and loricrin. Ectopic expression of HNF4α, but not of Cdx2 induced expression of Tff3, villin, K8 and E-cadherin. HNF4α is sufficient to induce a columnar-like phenotype in adult mouse oesophageal epithelium and is present in the human condition.

Consensus Guidelines for Implementing Pencil-Beam Scanning Proton Therapy for Thoracic Malignancies on Behalf of the PTCOG Thoracic and Lymphoma Subcommittee.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2017-05-19,"Pencil-beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy (PT), particularly intensity modulated PT, represents the latest advanced PT technology for treating cancers, including thoracic malignancies. On the basis of virtual clinical studies, PBS-PT appears to have great potential in its ability to tightly tailor the dose to the target while sparing critical structures, thereby reducing treatment-related toxicities, particularly for tumors in areas with complicated anatomy. However, implementing PBS-PT for moving targets has several additional technical challenges compared with intensity modulated photon radiation therapy or passive scattering PT. Four-dimensional computed tomography-based motion management and robust optimization and evaluation are crucial for minimizing uncertainties associated with beam range and organ motion. Rigorous quality assurance is required to validate dose delivery both before and during the course of treatment.

The Impact of Histologic Phenotype in the Treatment of Sinonasal Cancer.,Advances in therapy,Adv Ther,2017-09-04,"The management of sinonasal cancer is a challenge due to its low occurrence and anatomical and significant diversity of histological types. The therapeutic modality used should be tailored individually according to the histology, tumour stage, molecular profile and previous treatments. The clinical management of sinonasal cancer has improved greatly owing to developments in endoscopic surgery and precision radiotherapy.

Genomic Heterogeneity as a Barrier to Precision Medicine in Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma.,Cancer discovery,Cancer Discov,2017-10-04,"Gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) is a lethal disease where targeted therapies, even when guided by genomic biomarkers, have had limited efficacy. A potential reason for the failure of such therapies is that genomic profiling results could commonly differ between the primary and metastatic tumors. To evaluate genomic heterogeneity, we sequenced paired primary GEA and synchronous metastatic lesions across multiple cohorts, finding extensive differences in genomic alterations, including discrepancies in potentially clinically relevant alterations. Multiregion sequencing showed significant discrepancy within the primary tumor (PT) and between the PT and disseminated disease, with oncogene amplification profiles commonly discordant. In addition, a pilot analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing demonstrated the feasibility of detecting genomic amplifications not detected in PT sampling. Lastly, we profiled paired primary tumors, metastatic tumors, and cfDNA from patients enrolled in the personalized antibodies for GEA (PANGEA) trial of targeted therapies in GEA and found that genomic biomarkers were recurrently discrepant between the PT and untreated metastases. Divergent primary and metastatic tissue profiling led to treatment reassignment in 32% (9/28) of patients. In discordant primary and metastatic lesions, we found 87.5% concordance for targetable alterations in metastatic tissue and cfDNA, suggesting the potential for cfDNA profiling to enhance selection of therapy.<b>Significance:</b> We demonstrate frequent baseline heterogeneity in targetable genomic alterations in GEA, indicating that current tissue sampling practices for biomarker testing do not effectively guide precision medicine in this disease and that routine profiling of metastatic lesions and/or cfDNA should be systematically evaluated. <i>Cancer Discov; 8(1); 37-48. ©2017 AACR.</i><i>See related commentary by Sundar and Tan, p. 14</i><i>See related article by Janjigian et al., p. 49</i><i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1</i>.",Journal Article,839.0,63.0,Gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma GEA is a lethal disease where targeted therapies even when guided by genomic biomarkers have had limited efficacy A potential reason for the failure of such therapies is that genomic profiling results could commonly differ between the primary and metastatic tumors To evaluate genomic heterogeneity we sequenced paired primary GEA and synchronous metastatic lesions across multiple cohorts finding extensive differences in genomic alterations including discrepancies in potentially clinically relevant alterations Multiregion sequencing showed significant discrepancy within the primary tumor PT and between the PT and disseminated disease with oncogene amplification profiles commonly discordant In addition a pilot analysis of cell-free DNA cfDNA sequencing demonstrated the feasibility of detecting genomic amplifications not detected in PT sampling Lastly we profiled paired primary tumors metastatic tumors and cfDNA from patients enrolled in the personalized antibodies for GEA PANGEA trial of targeted therapies in GEA and found that genomic biomarkers were recurrently discrepant between the PT and untreated metastases Divergent primary and metastatic tissue profiling led to treatment reassignment in 32 9/28 of patients In discordant primary and metastatic lesions we found 87.5 concordance for targetable alterations in metastatic tissue and cfDNA suggesting the potential for cfDNA profiling to enhance selection of therapy. b Significance /b We demonstrate frequent baseline heterogeneity in targetable genomic alterations in GEA indicating that current tissue sampling practices for biomarker testing do not effectively guide precision medicine in this disease and that routine profiling of metastatic lesions and/or cfDNA should be systematically evaluated i Cancer Discov 8 1 37-48 ©2017 AACR. /i i See related commentary by Sundar and Tan p. 14 /i i See related article by Janjigian et al. p. 49 /i i This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature p. 1 /i,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[3227, 449, 13468, 16, 8, 2266, 34, 1257, 238, 235, 871, 198, 1808, 20, 572, 582, 47, 42, 383, 209, 8, 174, 3852, 9, 3, 496, 1, 225, 235, 16, 17, 572, 1080, 99, 359, 841, 1505, 59, 3, 86, 2, 113, 57, 6, 376, 572, 1144, 21, 4040, 2355, 86, 13468, 2, 2734, 113, 406, 716, 232, 736, 1567, 1344, 362, 4, 572, 593, 141, 7631, 4, 751, 505, 867, 593, 35903, 615, 224, 93, 7916, 262, 3, 86, 30, 3395, 2, 59, 3, 3395, 2, 3605, 34, 5, 1836, 1073, 1241, 841, 4570, 4, 352, 8, 2281, 65, 1, 31, 115, 261, 3475, 615, 264, 3, 1437, 1, 2502, 572, 4877, 44, 530, 4, 3395, 2874, 6354, 21, 5490, 2355, 86, 57, 113, 57, 2, 3475, 29, 7, 346, 4, 3, 2175, 890, 9, 13468, 79149, 160, 1, 238, 235, 4, 13468, 2, 204, 17, 572, 582, 11, 8820, 16266, 59, 3, 3395, 2, 1278, 196, 8332, 86, 2, 113, 246, 1080, 836, 6, 24, 51212, 4, 531, 83, 339, 1, 7, 4, 4570, 86, 2, 113, 406, 21, 204, 912, 33, 1827, 9, 3985, 593, 4, 113, 246, 2, 3475, 802, 3, 174, 9, 3475, 1080, 6, 1304, 881, 1, 36, 132, 724, 132, 21, 608, 908, 330, 1144, 4, 3985, 572, 593, 4, 13468, 1716, 17, 291, 246, 2874, 2634, 9, 901, 471, 1022, 44, 1856, 1597, 2720, 1807, 4, 26, 34, 2, 17, 1311, 1080, 1, 113, 406, 2, 15, 3475, 257, 40, 3390, 194, 70, 12, 7183, 66, 14, 567, 576, 3194, 1630, 70, 70, 3764, 139, 4662, 20, 36318, 2, 20425, 19, 213, 70, 70, 3764, 139, 946, 20, 79150, 2022, 2171, 19, 739, 70, 70, 26, 946, 16, 3681, 4, 3, 4, 26, 2537, 2705, 19, 14, 70]",,28978556,20
Postoperative Complications Drive Unplanned Readmissions After Esophagectomy for Cancer.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2018-01-31,"Hospital readmissions are increasingly viewed as a marker of inferior health care quality and penalized with decreased reimbursement. The timing of, and reasons for, readmissions after esophagectomy for cancer are not well understood. We examined the association of complications to 30-day postoperative-related, unplanned readmission to identify opportunities for improvement in patient care. We analyzed the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (2012 to 2015) to characterize 30-day postoperative unplanned readmissions after esophagectomy for cancer using descriptive statistics. Type and timing of readmission after discharge was assessed. A Cox proportional hazards model was developed to identify predictors of readmission. Of 3,723 patients who underwent esophagectomy for cancer, 1,419 (38.1%) experienced ≥1 complication within 30 days. A total of 400 patients (10.7%) experienced related, unplanned readmissions within 30 days of the operation, and postoperative complications were documented in 263 (65.8%). Leading causes of readmission were infectious, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal complications. Of these patients, 155 (59%) were readmitted within 7 days and 236 (90%) within 14 days of discharge. The Cox proportional hazards model identified readmission being associated with occurrence of postdischarge infectious, pulmonary, venous thromboembolic, and urinary tract infection complications, in-hospital urinary tract infection complications, and log-transformation of length of stay (representing increasing length of stay) (all p < 0.05). Postoperative occurrence of common complications and prolonged length of stay are associated with unplanned readmission after esophagectomy. Most patients are readmitted within 1 week of discharge.

Hyaluronic acid-grafted PLGA nanoparticles for the sustained delivery of berberine chloride for an efficient suppression of Ehrlich ascites tumors.,Drug delivery and translational research,Drug Deliv Transl Res,2018-06-01,"To promote the specific targeting and elimination of CD44-positive cancer cells, berberine chloride (BRB)-encapsulated hyaluronic acid-grafted poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) copolymer (BRB-d(HA)-g-PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared. The targeted action of these NPs was compared to non-targeted BRB-loaded PLGA NPs and bulk BRB. The in vitro studies demonstrated faster release of BRB and increased cytotoxicity of BRB-d(HA)-g-PLGA NPs in Hela and MCF-7 cells in comparison to BRB-PLGA NPs and bulk BRB. The uptake of BRB-d(HA)-g-PLGA NPs was increased in case of MCF-7 cells as compared to HeLa cells owing to the higher expression of CD44 receptors on MCF-7 cells. The CD44 receptor-mediated uptake of these NPs was confirmed through competitive inhibition experiments. The in vitro results were further validated in vivo in Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC)-bearing mice. EAC-bearing mice were injected intravenously with these NPs and the results obtained were compared with that of BRB-PLGA NPs and bulk BRB. BRB-d(HA)-g-PLGA NPs were found to significantly enhance apoptosis, sub-G1 content, life span, mean survival time, and ROS levels in EAC cells with subsequent decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and tumor burden ion tumor-bearing mice. Taking into account the findings of in vitro and in vivo studies, the enhanced and targeted anti-tumor activity of HA-grafted PLGA copolymer-encapsulated NPs of BRB cannot be negated.

Readmission Patterns After GI Cancer Hospitalizations: The Medical Versus Surgical Patient.,Journal of oncology practice,J Oncol Pract,2018-02-13,"Readmission within 30 days has been used as a metric for quality of care received at hospitals for certain diagnoses. In the era of accountability, value-based care, and increasing cancer costs, policymakers are looking into cancer readmissions as well. It is important to describe the readmission profile of patients with cancer in the most clinically relevant approach to inform policy and health care delivery that can positively impact patient outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using linked Texas Cancer Registry and Medicare claims data. We included elderly Texas residents diagnosed with GI cancer and identified risk factors for unplanned readmission using generalized estimating equations, comparing medical with surgical cancer-related hospitalizations. We analyzed 69,693 hospitalizations from 31,736 patients. The unplanned readmission rate was higher after medical hospitalizations than after surgical hospitalizations (21.6% v 13.4%, respectively). Shared risk factors for readmission after medical and surgical hospitalizations included advanced disease stage, high comorbidity index, and emergency room visit and radiation therapy within 30 days before index hospitalization. Several other associated factors and reasons for readmission were noted to be unique to medical or surgical hospitalizations alone.

Endoscopic and Histologic Features of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Related Colitis.,Inflammatory bowel diseases,Inflamm. Bowel Dis.,2018-07-01,"Diarrhea and colitis are the second most common immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPI)-induced adverse events. However, a comprehensive characterization of the endoscopic and histologic features of ICPI-induced diarrhea and colitis is lacking. Therefore, we aimed to describe endoscopic and histologic features of ICPI-induced gastrointestinal toxicities and to assess their association with patients' clinical characteristics and outcomes. We retrospectively reviewed records of 53 patients with ICPI-related diarrhea/colitis between 2011 and 2017. We collected data on demographics, diarrhea/colitis grade, treatment, and endoscopic and histologic findings. Long-term follow-up included repeat endoscopy findings, diarrhea recurrence, and overall survival. We compared groups by treatment, endoscopic and histologic findings, and constructed Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Most patients had grade 2 or higher diarrhea (87%) and colitis (60%). Thirty-one patients were successfully treated with corticosteroids, and 22 additionally required infliximab. On endoscopy, 21 (40%) patients had ulcerations and 22 (42%) had nonulcerative inflammation. Patients with ulcerations had more steroid-refractory disease (P = 0.044) and high-grade diarrhea (P = 0.033). Histology showed mostly acute (23%) or chronic (60%) inflammation. During mean follow-up duration of 18.9 months, 19 (36%) developed recurrent diarrhea. Most patients had persistent endoscopic (8/13, 62%) and histologic (9/11, 82%) inflammation.

EUS-guided fiducial placement for GI malignancies: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Gastrointestinal endoscopy,Gastrointest. Endosc.,2018-11-13,"Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) allows the delivery of radiation with high precision to a target lesion while minimizing toxicity to surrounding tissues. EUS provides excellent visualization of GI tumors and consequently is being used for fiducial placement with increased frequency. Our goal was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies evaluating the technical aspects, safety, and efficacy of EUS fiducial placement for IGRT in GI malignancies. A systematic literature search was carried out in the following databases: Medline, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, using Medical Subject Headings terms combined with text words. A random effects model was used to determine pooled proportions of technical success, migration, and adverse event rates. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I<sup>2</sup> statistic. Publication bias was assessed visually using a funnel plot and by the Begg and Egger tests. Nine full articles and 5 abstracts reporting on 1155 patients, 49% from a single study by Dhadham et al, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled rate of technical success was 98% (95% confidence interval [CI], 96-99). Moderate heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 34.18) was present, which appeared to be due to variable sample sizes. Publication bias was present, suggesting that studies with less-substantial outcomes may have not been reported (Begg test, P = .87; Egger test, P < .01).

Estimating neoplasia detection rate (NDR) in patients with Barrett's oesophagus based on index endoscopy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Gut,Gut,2019-03-14,"Biopsies are obtained to confirm intestinal metaplasia and rule out prevalent dysplasia and cancer when Barrett's oesophagus (BE) is detected at index upper endoscopy (oesophagogastroduodenoscopy [EGD]). The purpose of this systematic review was to obtain summary estimates of the prevalence of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and oesophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) associated with BE during index EGD for chronic GERD symptoms, defined as neoplasia detection rate (NDR) which could be used as a quality measure. An extensive search was performed within PUBMED, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library databases to identify studies in which patients underwent index endoscopy for the evaluation of the presence of BE. Two reviewers independently evaluated both the study eligibility and methodological quality and data extraction. A random-effects model (REM) based on the binomial distribution was used to calculate the pooled effects of the prevalence of BE-associated dysplasia and EAC. For the calculation of dysplasia and EAC prevalence rates, a total of 11 studies with 10 632 patients met the inclusion criteria including 80.4% men with a mean age of 58.7 years and average BE length of 3.5 cm. The pooled prevalence of EAC, HGD and LGD was 3%(95% CI 2 to 5, 9 studies: 396/10 539 patients), 3%(95% CI 2 to 5 [REM], 9 studies: 388/10 539 patients) and 10%(95% CI 7 to 15 [REM], 10 studies: 907/8945 patients), respectively. For NDR, that is, the pooled prevalence of HGD/EAC was 7%(95% CI 4 to 10 [REM], 10 studies: 795/10 632 patients).

Impact of Electronic Chromoendoscopy on Adenoma Miss Rates During Colonoscopy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2019-09-01,"The impact of virtual chromoendoscopy such as narrow-band imaging, Fujinon intelligent chromoendoscopy, blue-light imaging, linked-color imaging, and i-SCAN on adenoma detection rate has been variable. However, adenoma miss rate (another measure suggested as a quality indicator) of electronic chromoendoscopy modalities has not been systematically evaluated. This study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the adenoma miss rate of white-light endoscopy compared with electronic chromoendoscopy. Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane were the data sources for this study. The studies selected were tandem randomized controlled trials of electronic chromoendoscopy modalities compared with white-light endoscopy. Electronic chromoendoscopy compared with white light endoscopy was used to measure the adenoma miss rate. Primary outcome was the pooled adenoma miss rate of electronic chromoendoscopy techniques compared with white-light endoscopy. Secondary outcomes were subgroup analysis, adenoma size analysis, and adenoma detection rate. A total of 3507 patients were evaluated from 7 eligible tandem randomized control trials. A total of 1423 patients had white-light endoscopy as the first of the tandem examinations. The rest of the patients had electronic chromoendoscopy as the first of the tandem examination (narrow-band imaging, 988 patients; Fujinon intelligent chromoendoscopy, 728 patients; i-SCAN, 233 patients; blue-light imaging, 64 patients; and linked-color imaging, 71 patients). The pooled adenoma miss rate for electronic chromoendoscopy was not different than white-light endoscopy (17.9% vs 21%; OR, 0.72 (0.67-1.11); I 67%; p = 0.13). When only narrow-band imaging, blue-light imaging, and linked-color imaging were considered, the pooled rate was statistically significant (OR, 0.60 (0.37-0.98); p = 0.04). The pooled adenoma detection rate was not statistically different with electronic chromoendoscopy than white-light endoscopy (OR, 1.02 (0.88-1.19); p = 0.78). The small number of studies to assess the impact of each modality limited stratified conclusions.
