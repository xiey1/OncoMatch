Adjuvant external beam radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy in the management of gallbladder carcinoma.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2002-01-01,"This study was performed to evaluate the outcome of patients with gallbladder cancer who received postoperative concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Curative resection followed by adjuvant combined modality therapy with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and chemotherapy was attempted in 21 consecutive gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) patients at the Mayo Clinic from 1985 through 1997. All patients received concurrent 5-fluorouracil during EBRT. EBRT fields encompassed the tumor bed and regional lymph nodes (median dose of 54 Gy in 1.8-2.0-Gy fractions). One patient received 15 Gy intraoperatively after EBRT. A retrospective analysis was performed for the end points of local control, distant failure, and overall survival. After maximal resection, 12 patients had no residual disease on pathologic evaluation, 5 had microscopic residual disease, and 4 had gross residual disease. One patient had Stage I disease, and 20 had Stage III-IV disease. With median follow-up of 5 years (range: 2.6-11.5 years), 5-year survival for the entire cohort was 33%. The 5-year survival rate of patients with Stage I-III disease was 65% vs. 0% for those with Stage IV disease (p < 0.02). For patients with no residual disease, 5-year survival was 64% vs. 0% for those with residual disease (p = 0.002). The median survival was 0.6, 1.4, and 5.1 years for patients with gross residual, microscopic residual, and no residual disease, respectively (p = 0.02). The 5-year local control rate for the entire cohort was 73%. Two-year local control rates were 0%, 80%, and 88% for patients with gross residual, microscopic residual, or no residual disease, respectively (p < 0.01). Five-year local control rates were 100% for the 6 patients who received total EBRT doses >54 Gy (microscopic residual, 3 patients; gross residual, 1 patient; negative but narrow margins, 2 patients) vs. 65% for the 15 who received a lower dose (3, gross residual; 2, microresidual; 10, negative margins). Patients with completely resected (negative margins) GBC followed by adjuvant EBRT plus 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy had a relatively favorable prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of 64%. These results seem to be superior to historical surgical controls from the Mayo Clinic and other institutions, which report 5-year survival rates of approximately 33% with complete resection alone. Both tumor stage and extent of resection seemed to influence survival and local control. More aggressive measures using current cancer therapies and integration of new cancer treatment modalities will be required to favorably impact on the poor prognosis of patients with Stage IV or subtotally resected GBC. Additional investigation leading to earlier diagnosis is warranted, because most patients with GBC present with advanced disease.",Journal Article,6594.0,118.0,This study was performed to evaluate the outcome of patients with cancer who received postoperative concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy Curative resection followed by adjuvant combined modality therapy with external beam radiation therapy EBRT and chemotherapy was attempted in 21 consecutive carcinoma GBC patients at the Mayo Clinic from 1985 through 1997 All patients received concurrent 5-fluorouracil during EBRT EBRT fields encompassed the tumor bed and regional lymph nodes median dose of 54 Gy in 1.8-2.0-Gy fractions One patient received 15 Gy intraoperatively after EBRT A retrospective analysis was performed for the end points of local control distant failure and overall survival After maximal resection 12 patients had no residual disease on pathologic evaluation 5 had microscopic residual disease and 4 had gross residual disease One patient had Stage I disease and 20 had Stage III-IV disease With median follow-up of 5 years range 2.6-11.5 years 5-year survival for the entire cohort was 33 The 5-year survival rate of patients with Stage I-III disease was 65 vs. 0 for those with Stage IV disease p 0.02 For patients with no residual disease 5-year survival was 64 vs. 0 for those with residual disease p 0.002 The median survival was 0.6 1.4 and 5.1 years for patients with gross residual microscopic residual and no residual disease respectively p 0.02 The 5-year local control rate for the entire cohort was 73 Two-year local control rates were 0 80 and 88 for patients with gross residual microscopic residual or no residual disease respectively p 0.01 Five-year local control rates were 100 for the 6 patients who received total EBRT doses 54 Gy microscopic residual 3 patients gross residual 1 patient negative but narrow margins 2 patients vs. 65 for the 15 who received a lower dose 3 gross residual 2 microresidual 10 negative margins Patients with completely resected negative margins GBC followed by adjuvant EBRT plus 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy had a relatively favorable prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of 64 These results seem to be superior to historical surgical controls from the Mayo Clinic and other institutions which report 5-year survival rates of approximately 33 with complete resection alone Both tumor stage and extent of resection seemed to influence survival and local control More aggressive measures using current cancer therapies and integration of new cancer treatment modalities will be required to favorably impact on the poor prognosis of patients with Stage IV or subtotally resected GBC Additional investigation leading to earlier diagnosis is warranted because most patients with GBC present with advanced disease,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[26, 45, 10, 173, 6, 376, 3, 228, 1, 7, 5, 12, 54, 103, 573, 750, 56, 2, 121, 36, 1075, 170, 370, 20, 249, 397, 1396, 36, 5, 1455, 1345, 121, 36, 1883, 2, 56, 10, 4098, 4, 239, 935, 134, 6344, 7, 28, 3, 2486, 1188, 29, 4675, 298, 2341, 62, 7, 103, 750, 33, 1404, 190, 1883, 1883, 3130, 9226, 3, 30, 2929, 2, 951, 263, 502, 52, 61, 1, 667, 381, 4, 14, 66, 18, 13, 381, 1550, 104, 69, 103, 167, 381, 6595, 50, 1883, 8, 459, 65, 10, 173, 9, 3, 396, 862, 1, 293, 182, 626, 496, 2, 63, 25, 50, 2725, 170, 133, 7, 42, 77, 753, 34, 23, 510, 451, 33, 42, 2984, 753, 34, 2, 39, 42, 1789, 753, 34, 104, 69, 42, 82, 70, 34, 2, 179, 42, 82, 316, 478, 34, 5, 52, 166, 126, 1, 33, 60, 184, 18, 49, 175, 33, 60, 33, 111, 25, 9, 3, 1797, 180, 10, 466, 3, 33, 111, 25, 116, 1, 7, 5, 82, 70, 316, 34, 10, 556, 105, 13, 9, 135, 5, 82, 478, 34, 19, 13, 588, 9, 7, 5, 77, 753, 34, 33, 111, 25, 10, 660, 105, 13, 9, 135, 5, 753, 34, 19, 13, 1111, 3, 52, 25, 10, 13, 49, 14, 39, 2, 33, 14, 60, 9, 7, 5, 1789, 753, 2984, 753, 2, 77, 753, 34, 106, 19, 13, 588, 3, 33, 111, 293, 182, 116, 9, 3, 1797, 180, 10, 803, 100, 111, 293, 182, 151, 11, 13, 493, 2, 889, 9, 7, 5, 1789, 753, 2984, 753, 15, 77, 753, 34, 106, 19, 13, 355, 365, 111, 293, 182, 151, 11, 394, 9, 3, 49, 7, 54, 103, 181, 1883, 415, 667, 381, 2984, 753, 27, 7, 1789, 753, 14, 69, 199, 84, 6958, 1012, 18, 7, 105, 556, 9, 3, 167, 54, 103, 8, 280, 61, 27, 1789, 753, 18, 52686, 79, 199, 1012, 7, 5, 2500, 1133, 199, 1012, 6344, 370, 20, 249, 1883, 349, 33, 1404, 56, 42, 8, 1352, 913, 356, 5, 8, 33, 111, 25, 116, 1, 660, 46, 99, 3233, 6, 40, 1123, 6, 2252, 221, 535, 29, 3, 2486, 1188, 2, 127, 1764, 92, 414, 33, 111, 25, 151, 1, 705, 466, 5, 236, 170, 279, 110, 30, 82, 2, 1039, 1, 170, 5025, 6, 1054, 25, 2, 293, 182, 80, 571, 1018, 75, 291, 12, 235, 2, 2676, 1, 217, 12, 24, 1558, 303, 40, 616, 6, 5001, 345, 23, 3, 334, 356, 1, 7, 5, 82, 478, 15, 21937, 1133, 6344, 402, 940, 1049, 6, 1677, 147, 16, 1197, 408, 96, 7, 5, 6344, 364, 5, 131, 34]",2687.0,11777635,146

Staging laparoscopy in patients with extrahepatic biliary carcinoma. Analysis of 100 patients.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2002-03-01,"To evaluate the benefit of staging laparoscopy in patients with gallbladder cancer and hilar cholangiocarcinoma. In patients with extrahepatic biliary carcinoma, unresectable disease is often found at the time of exploration despite extensive preoperative evaluation, thus resulting in unnecessary laparotomy. From October 1997 to May 2001, 100 patients with potentially resectable gallbladder cancer (n = 44) and hilar cholangiocarcinoma (n = 56) were prospectively evaluated. All patients underwent staging laparoscopy followed by laparotomy if the tumor appeared resectable. Surgical findings, resectability rate, length of stay, and operative time were analyzed. Patients underwent multiple preoperative imaging tests, including computed tomography scan, ultrasound, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and direct cholangiography. Laparoscopy identified unresectable disease in 35 of 100 patients. In the 65 patients undergoing open exploration, 34 were found to have unresectable disease. Therefore, the overall accuracy for detecting unresectable disease was 51%. There was no difference in the accuracy of laparoscopy between patients with gallbladder cancer and hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Laparoscopy detected the majority of patients with peritoneal or liver metastases but failed to detect all locally advanced tumors. In patients undergoing biopsy only, laparoscopic identification of unresectable disease significantly reduced operative time and length of stay compared with patients undergoing laparotomy. The yield of laparoscopy was 48% in patients with gallbladder cancer (56% in those who did not undergo previous cholecystectomy), but only 25% in patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma. However, in patients with locally advanced but potentially resectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma, the yield of laparoscopy was greater, 36% (12/33, T2/T3 tumors) versus 9% (2/23, T1 tumors). Laparoscopy identifies the majority of patients with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder carcinoma, thereby reducing both the incidence of unnecessary laparotomy and the length of stay. The yield of laparoscopy is lower for hilar cholangiocarcinoma but can be improved by targeting patients at higher risk of occult unresectable disease. All patients with potentially resectable primary gallbladder cancer and patients with T2/T3 hilar cholangiocarcinoma should undergo staging laparoscopy before surgical exploration.",Journal Article,6535.0,196.0,To evaluate the benefit of staging laparoscopy in patients with cancer and hilar cholangiocarcinoma In patients with extrahepatic biliary carcinoma unresectable disease is often found at the time of exploration despite extensive preoperative evaluation thus resulting in unnecessary laparotomy From October 1997 to May 2001 100 patients with potentially resectable cancer n 44 and hilar cholangiocarcinoma n 56 were prospectively evaluated All patients underwent staging laparoscopy followed by laparotomy if the tumor appeared resectable Surgical findings resectability rate length of stay and operative time were analyzed Patients underwent multiple preoperative imaging tests including computed tomography scan ultrasound magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and direct cholangiography Laparoscopy identified unresectable disease in 35 of 100 patients In the 65 patients undergoing open exploration 34 were found to have unresectable disease Therefore the overall accuracy for detecting unresectable disease was 51 There was no difference in the accuracy of laparoscopy between patients with cancer and hilar cholangiocarcinoma Laparoscopy detected the majority of patients with peritoneal or metastases but failed to detect all locally advanced tumors In patients undergoing biopsy only laparoscopic identification of unresectable disease significantly reduced operative time and length of stay compared with patients undergoing laparotomy The yield of laparoscopy was 48 in patients with cancer 56 in those who did not undergo previous cholecystectomy but only 25 in patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma However in patients with locally advanced but potentially resectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma the yield of laparoscopy was greater 36 12/33 T2/T3 tumors versus 9 2/23 T1 tumors Laparoscopy identifies the majority of patients with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma or carcinoma thereby reducing both the incidence of unnecessary laparotomy and the length of stay The yield of laparoscopy is lower for hilar cholangiocarcinoma but can be improved by targeting patients at higher risk of occult unresectable disease All patients with potentially resectable primary cancer and patients with T2/T3 hilar cholangiocarcinoma should undergo staging laparoscopy before surgical exploration,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 376, 3, 247, 1, 632, 3553, 4, 7, 5, 12, 2, 4793, 2126, 4, 7, 5, 3710, 2532, 134, 1468, 34, 16, 629, 204, 28, 3, 98, 1, 3370, 550, 1344, 498, 451, 631, 1113, 4, 4224, 3274, 29, 2551, 2341, 6, 68, 1758, 394, 7, 5, 751, 1899, 12, 78, 584, 2, 4793, 2126, 78, 664, 11, 1143, 194, 62, 7, 208, 632, 3553, 370, 20, 3274, 492, 3, 30, 2121, 1899, 221, 272, 5150, 116, 1318, 1, 2020, 2, 1208, 98, 11, 311, 7, 208, 232, 498, 270, 895, 141, 1220, 872, 1657, 1945, 1484, 1535, 15476, 2, 1196, 21954, 3553, 108, 1468, 34, 4, 465, 1, 394, 7, 4, 3, 556, 7, 479, 1020, 3370, 562, 11, 204, 6, 47, 1468, 34, 673, 3, 63, 1190, 9, 2502, 1468, 34, 10, 725, 125, 10, 77, 523, 4, 3, 1190, 1, 3553, 59, 7, 5, 12, 2, 4793, 2126, 3553, 530, 3, 686, 1, 7, 5, 1639, 15, 196, 84, 1551, 6, 1426, 62, 795, 131, 57, 4, 7, 479, 411, 158, 1964, 911, 1, 1468, 34, 97, 405, 1208, 98, 2, 1318, 1, 2020, 72, 5, 7, 479, 3274, 3, 2309, 1, 3553, 10, 576, 4, 7, 5, 12, 664, 4, 135, 54, 205, 44, 1251, 698, 8493, 84, 158, 243, 4, 7, 5, 4793, 2126, 137, 4, 7, 5, 795, 131, 84, 751, 1899, 4793, 2126, 3, 2309, 1, 3553, 10, 378, 511, 133, 466, 1786, 2065, 57, 185, 83, 18, 382, 1534, 57, 3553, 2953, 3, 686, 1, 7, 5, 1468, 4793, 2126, 15, 134, 2267, 1818, 110, 3, 287, 1, 4224, 3274, 2, 3, 1318, 1, 2020, 3, 2309, 1, 3553, 16, 280, 9, 4793, 2126, 84, 122, 40, 231, 20, 529, 7, 28, 142, 43, 1, 2879, 1468, 34, 62, 7, 5, 751, 1899, 86, 12, 2, 7, 5, 1786, 2065, 4793, 2126, 257, 1251, 632, 3553, 348, 221, 3370]",2302.0,11882761,35
Human carboxylesterase 2 is commonly expressed in tumor tissue and is correlated with activation of irinotecan.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2002-08-01,"The prodrug irinotecan is an active agent for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer and a number of other solid tumors. Irinotecan is converted in vivo to SN-38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin), the active metabolite that causes cell death, by human liver carboxylesterases. Previous studies suggest that human carboxylesterase 2 (CES2) is the key activating isoform. Although conversion of irinotecan to SN-38 by liver carboxylesterase is an inefficient process, clinical data indicate that irinotecan has significant antitumor activity. This scenario raises the possibility that local conversion of irinotecan to SN-38 by CES2 in tumor tissues might occur. The expression profile of CES2 protein in human tumor tissues was evaluated in a tissue array of 18 different types of human cancer and in a panel of normal human liver samples by immunohistochemistry and Western blot, respectively. Cytosolic CES2 expression was observed in 101 of 154 tumors (66%) and 55 of 60 normal tissues (92%). Among the 18 types of tumors analyzed, 2 types (gallbladder tumor and lymphoma) did not express CES2, 5 types expressed weak CES2, and 11 types expressed moderate to intense CES2. In functional studies, CES2 protein was highly variable among liver samples, with a 15-fold range in cytosol and a 3-fold range in microsome fractions.

Phase I pharmacodynamic study of time and sequence dependency of hydroxyurea in combination with gemcitabine: a California Cancer Consortium Trial.,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol.,2002-09-12,"Preclinical studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that prior exposure to hydroxyurea increases the percentage of cells in S phase, enhancing the cytotoxicity of subsequent gemcitabine treatment in human oropharyngeal KB cells. To evaluate the clinical implications of this time- and sequence-dependent potentiation, we performed a phase I trial of hydroxyurea given over 24 h followed by a 30-min infusion of gemcitabine in weeks 1 and 2 of a 3-week cycle. The dose of hydroxyurea was fixed at 500 mg orally every 6 h for four doses starting 24 h before each dose of gemcitabine. The initial dose level of gemcitabine was 250 mg/m(2) on days 2 and 9, and this was escalated stepwise to 1000 mg/m(2) on days 2 and 9. Gemcitabine pharmacokinetics were determined on days 2 and 9 of the first cycle. Of 27 patients enrolled (12 female, 15 male), 24 were evaluable for response and 23 were evaluable for toxicity. Their median age was 56 years (range 27-76 years). Tumor types included lung, head and neck, pancreas, breast, colon, prostate, stomach, ovary, esophagus, germ cell, thyroid, gallbladder, and unknown primary. A total of 80 cycles of treatment were completed. One patient (unknown primary) had an objective partial response lasting 21 months, and 12 patients had stable disease. All observed dose-limiting toxicities were related to myelosuppression. The gemcitabine maximum tolerated dose was established at 750 mg/m(2) on days 2 and 9. Hydroxyurea had no effect on the plasma pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine. These results suggest that hydroxyurea followed by gemcitabine can be safely administered and has activity on this schedule.

Role of laparoscopy in the evaluation of biliary tract cancer.,Surgical oncology clinics of North America,Surg. Oncol. Clin. N. Am.,2002-10-01,"Patients with malignancies of the biliary tract have a dismal prognosis. As in most abdominal cancers, resection is the only effective treatment with potential for cure. Preoperative staging is not completely accurate, however, and a significant number of patients with biliary carcinoma undergo unnecessary laparotomy. As imaging technology improves, more patients with unresectable disease will be identified, avoiding the need for a laparotomy. Laparoscopy is a major addition, but its usefulness in staging of abdominal malignancies continues to evolve. The importance of laparoscopy to better predict the resectability in liver malignancies increasingly has been recognized. Conversely, the use of staging laparoscopy for other cancers has shown little benefit. For hilar cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer, the authors' analysis of 100 patients supports the use of staging laparoscopy for assessing these tumors. In this series, staging laparoscopy correctly identified unresectable disease and prevented unnecessary laparotomy in one third of patients. Patients with unresectable disease that was not detected at laparoscopy most often had locally advanced tumors. LUS did not contribute to the assessment of resectability in these patients. The yield of laparoscopy was lower for hilar cholangiocarcinoma, but could be improved by targeting patients who are at higher risk for occult unresectable disease, such as patients with T2 or T3 lesions. These patients and patients with primary gallbladder carcinoma have a high incidence of metastatic disease and should undergo laparoscopic staging before attempting at resection.",Journal Article,6321.0,36.0,Patients with malignancies of the biliary tract have a dismal prognosis As in most abdominal cancers resection is the only effective treatment with potential for cure Preoperative staging is not completely accurate however and a significant number of patients with biliary carcinoma undergo unnecessary laparotomy As imaging technology improves more patients with unresectable disease will be identified avoiding the need for a laparotomy Laparoscopy is a major addition but its usefulness in staging of abdominal malignancies continues to evolve The importance of laparoscopy to better predict the resectability in malignancies increasingly has been recognized Conversely the use of staging laparoscopy for other cancers has shown little benefit For hilar cholangiocarcinoma and cancer the authors analysis of 100 patients supports the use of staging laparoscopy for assessing these tumors In this series staging laparoscopy correctly identified unresectable disease and prevented unnecessary laparotomy in one third of patients Patients with unresectable disease that was not detected at laparoscopy most often had locally advanced tumors LUS did not contribute to the assessment of resectability in these patients The yield of laparoscopy was lower for hilar cholangiocarcinoma but could be improved by targeting patients who are at higher risk for occult unresectable disease such as patients with T2 or T3 lesions These patients and patients with primary carcinoma have a high incidence of metastatic disease and should undergo laparoscopic staging before attempting at resection,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[7, 5, 441, 1, 3, 2532, 1696, 47, 8, 3929, 356, 22, 4, 96, 1467, 163, 170, 16, 3, 158, 323, 24, 5, 174, 9, 1722, 498, 632, 16, 44, 2500, 1481, 137, 2, 8, 93, 207, 1, 7, 5, 2532, 134, 1251, 4224, 3274, 22, 270, 2033, 1804, 80, 7, 5, 1468, 34, 303, 40, 108, 6048, 3, 594, 9, 8, 3274, 3553, 16, 8, 458, 352, 84, 211, 5235, 4, 632, 1, 1467, 441, 2274, 6, 4800, 3, 1187, 1, 3553, 6, 380, 678, 3, 5150, 4, 441, 1635, 71, 85, 1904, 3154, 3, 119, 1, 632, 3553, 9, 127, 163, 71, 443, 1215, 247, 9, 4793, 2126, 2, 12, 3, 738, 65, 1, 394, 7, 2304, 3, 119, 1, 632, 3553, 9, 1977, 46, 57, 4, 26, 988, 632, 3553, 4911, 108, 1468, 34, 2, 3902, 4224, 3274, 4, 104, 1282, 1, 7, 7, 5, 1468, 34, 17, 10, 44, 530, 28, 3553, 96, 629, 42, 795, 131, 57, 19550, 205, 44, 1248, 6, 3, 455, 1, 5150, 4, 46, 7, 3, 2309, 1, 3553, 10, 280, 9, 4793, 2126, 84, 359, 40, 231, 20, 529, 7, 54, 32, 28, 142, 43, 9, 2879, 1468, 34, 225, 22, 7, 5, 1786, 15, 2065, 406, 46, 7, 2, 7, 5, 86, 134, 47, 8, 64, 287, 1, 113, 34, 2, 257, 1251, 1964, 632, 348, 9632, 28, 170]",1584.0,12607577,122

Progression of gene hypermethylation in gallstone disease leading to gallbladder cancer.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2003-10-01,"Aberrant methylation of tumor-suppressor genes is associated with a loss of gene function that can afford selective growth advantages to sporadic neoplastic cells arising during gallbladder inflammation. Fifty-four gallbladder neoplasms were selected from tumor banks in the United States and Chile. Each of the neoplasms was subjected to methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction to detect promoter methylation associated with six candidate tumor-suppressor genes (p16, APC, methylguanine methyltransferase, hMLH1, retinoic acid receptor beta-2, and p73) implicated in multiple human cancer types. Aberrant methylation of any of the six candidate tumor-suppressor genes was detected in 72% of the gallbladder neoplasms, 28% of the cases of chronic cholecystitis, and in only 1 of the 15 normal gallbladder controls. The four most commonly methylated genes in the gallbladder cancers were p16 (56%), p73 (28%), APC (27%), and hMLH1 (14%). Significant differences in gene methylation were discovered between US gallbladder cancers and those from Chile, where gallbladder cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths.

Patterns of initial disease recurrence after resection of gallbladder carcinoma and hilar cholangiocarcinoma: implications for adjuvant therapeutic strategies.,Cancer,Cancer,2003-10-01,"Current approaches to adjuvant treatment after resection of gallbladder carcinoma (GBCA) and hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCCA) are based on an incomplete understanding of the recurrence patterns of these diseases. Through an in-depth analysis of the sites of initial recurrence after resection of GBCA and HCCA, the current study aimed to highlight differences in the biology of these tumors and to provide further insight for adjuvant therapeutic strategies. Patients with either GBCA or HCCA who underwent a potentially curative resection were identified prospectively from a maintained database. Specific sites of initial disease recurrence were identified retrospectively and categorized as locoregional (resection margin, porta hepatis, or retroperitoneal lymph nodes) or distant (peritoneal, extraabdominal, or discontiguous liver metastases). Differences in disease recurrence patterns, time to disease recurrence, and overall and site-specific survival were analyzed. Between May 1990 and August 2001, 177 patients underwent potentially curative resection, 97 for GBCA and 80 for HCCA. Disease recurrence and follow-up data were available for 156 patients (80 with GBCA and 76 with HCCA). The median time to disease recurrence was shorter for patients with GBCA compared with patients with HCCA (11.5 vs. 20.3 months; P = 0.007). Overall, 52 (68%) patients with HCCA and 53 (66%) patients with GBCA had disease recurrene at a median follow-up of 24 months. Of those who developed disease recurrence, isolated locoregional disease as the first site of failure occurred in 15% of patients with GBCA compared with 59% of patients with HCCA (P < 0.001). By contrast, an initial GBCA recurrence involving a distant site, with or without concomitant locoregional recurrence, occurred in 85% of patients compared with 41% of patients with HCCA (P < 0.001). This pattern of disease recurrence was diagnosis specific and did not change significantly when patients were stratified by several clinicopathologic factors, including disease stage and its component variables. Using multivariate analysis, diagnosis was an independent predictor of the site of disease recurrence. Among patients who experienced disease recurrence, survival was greater among the patients with HCCA compared with patients with GBCA (29 months vs. 20.6 months, respectively; P = 0.037). For both tumors, the site of initial disease recurrence had no apparent impact on survival time. After resection, recurrent GBCA is much more likely than recurrent HCCA to involve a distant site. GBCA is also associated with a much shorter time to recurrence and a shorter survival period after recurrence. The results demonstrated significant differences in the clinical behavior of these tumors and suggested that an adjuvant therapeutic strategy targeting locoregional disease, such as radiotherapy, is unlikely to have a significant impact in the overall management of GBCA. Conversely, there is at least some rationale for such an approach in patients with HCCA based on the pattern of initial recurrence.",Journal Article,5956.0,290.0,Current approaches to adjuvant

Role of CT in the management of recurrent ovarian cancer.,AJR. American journal of roentgenology,AJR Am J Roentgenol,2004-02-01,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential role of preoperative CT in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who undergo secondary cytoreductive surgery. Preoperative CT examinations of 36 consecutive patients (age range, 30-75 years; mean age, 55 years) were reviewed retrospectively. Patients had recurrent ovarian cancer and secondary cytoreduction within a mean CT-surgery interval of 22 days (range, 2-69 days). The CT findings recorded were upper abdominal metastases (e.g., peritoneal carcinomatosis; perihepatic, perisplenic, gastrohepatic or gastrosplenic ligaments; gallbladder fossa; falciform ligament; lesser sac), lymphadenopathy (above or below the renal hilum), liver metastasis, large- and small-bowel obstruction, hydronephrosis, ascites, and the presence of a pelvic mass. CT findings and cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) levels were correlated with surgical resectability. At surgery, tumors in 27 patients were optimally debulked (residual disease of <or= 1 cm) and in nine patients were nonresectable. Using multivariate analysis, hydronephrosis (odds ratio = 19.4, p = 0.03) and invasion of pelvic sidewall (odds ratio = 35.6, p = 0.006) were found to be most indicative of tumor nonresectability. The presence of small-bowel obstruction; nodal or perihepatic liver metastasis; ascites; peritoneal carcinomatosis; bladder, rectum, sigmoid colon, or vaginal involvement; or infrarenal paraaortic adenopathy; and the level of CA-125 were not strong indicators of tumor nonresectability.

This study reports on the prevalence, etiology, and clinical significance of jaundice in patients with gallbladder cancer. Patients who presented with gallbladder cancer from 1995 to 2002 were entered into a prospective database. Disease-specific survival and clinicopathologic correlates were analyzed. Eighty-two (34%) of 240 patients with gallbladder cancer presented with jaundice. Jaundiced patients (96%) were more likely (P <.001) to have advanced-stage disease than nonjaundiced patients (60%). Only six (7%) jaundiced patients were resected with curative intent, and only four (5%) had negative surgical margins. This was significantly different from the nonjaundiced group, in which 62 patients (39%) had negative margins (P <.001). The median disease-specific survival in patients presenting with jaundice was 6 months and was significantly lower compared with 16 months in patients without jaundice (P <.0001). In the group presenting with jaundice, there were no disease-free survivors at 2 years, compared with 21% in the group without jaundice.

Analysis of novel tumor markers in pancreatic and biliary carcinomas using tissue microarrays.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2004-03-01,"Using global gene expression analyses, multiple novel tumor markers overexpressed in infiltrating ductal adenocarcinomas of the pancreas have recently been identified. However, the expression of these markers in morphologically similar adenocarcinomas of the biliary tree has not been investigated. The purpose of the present study was 3-fold. First, we used 8 markers that have been shown to be overexpressed in whole tissue sections of pancreatic adenocarcinomas to validate tissue microarrays (TMAs) created from a series of pancreatic adenocarcinomas (n=68). The labeling patterns of 6 epithelial markers (fascin, mucin 4, 14-3-3sigma, prostate stem cell antigen, topoisomerase IIalpha, and cdc2/p34) were concordant with previously published studies on whole tissue sections, yet required far fewer slides and reagents. Mesothelin, an epithelial marker, and heat shock protein 47, a marker of peritumoral desmoplasia, showed lower levels of expression in the TMAs when compared with whole tissue sections. Second, we examined the previously unknown expression of the same 8 novel tumor proteins in cancers of the biliary tree by using TMAs created from a series of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, gallbladder adenocarcinomas, and adenocarcinomas of the distal common bile duct (n=38). Each of the 8 markers was overexpressed in the biliary cancers, ranging from 14% demonstrating at least focal labeling with prostate stem cell antigen to 100% labeling with cdc2/p34. Most of the markers showed lower frequencies of expression in the biliary tract carcinomas in comparison to the pancreatic adenocarcinomas. In addition, expression patterns varied with location in the biliary system (intrahepatic versus gallbladder versus distal common bile duct). These differences were statistically significant (P<0.05) for mesothelin, mucin 4, and heat shock protein 47. Finally, the expression of selected markers in neoplastic progression of gallbladder cancer was examined. Two markers, fascin and mesothelin, showed up-regulation of expression with transition from carcinoma in situ to invasive adenocarcinoma, implicating a role for these markers in neoplastic progression. The results of this study indicate that TMA technology provides valid and cost-effective means to screen large numbers of novel tumor markers, even in tumors such as pancreatic and biliary adenocarcinomas that characteristically have abundant desmoplastic stroma. In addition, novel tumor markers of pancreatic adenocarcinomas show similar, yet not identical, expression patterns in biliary carcinomas. Therefore, these markers are potentially useful in developing diagnostic tests and treatment paradigms for tumors involving the biliary system.",Journal Article,5804.0,116.0,Using global gene expression analyses multiple novel tumor markers overexpressed in infiltrating ductal adenocarcinomas of the have recently been identified However the expression of these markers in morphologically similar adenocarcinomas of the biliary tree has not been investigated The purpose of the present study was 3-fold First we used 8 markers that have been shown to be overexpressed in whole tissue sections of adenocarcinomas to validate tissue microarrays TMAs created from a series of adenocarcinomas n=68 The labeling patterns of 6 epithelial markers fascin mucin 4 14-3-3sigma stem cell antigen topoisomerase IIalpha and cdc2/p34 were concordant with previously published studies on whole tissue sections yet required far fewer slides and reagents Mesothelin an epithelial marker and heat shock protein 47 a marker of peritumoral desmoplasia showed lower levels of expression in the TMAs when compared with whole tissue sections Second we examined the previously unknown expression of the same 8 novel tumor proteins in cancers of the biliary tree by using TMAs created from a series of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas adenocarcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the distal common duct n=38 Each of the 8 markers was overexpressed in the biliary cancers ranging from 14 demonstrating at least focal labeling with stem cell antigen to 100 labeling with cdc2/p34 Most of the markers showed lower frequencies of expression in the biliary tract carcinomas in comparison to the adenocarcinomas In addition expression patterns varied with location in the biliary system intrahepatic versus versus distal common duct These differences were statistically significant P 0.05 for mesothelin mucin 4 and heat shock protein 47 Finally the expression of selected markers in neoplastic progression of cancer was examined Two markers fascin and mesothelin showed up-regulation of expression with transition from carcinoma in situ to invasive adenocarcinoma implicating a role for these markers in neoplastic progression The results of this study indicate that TMA technology provides valid and cost-effective means to screen large numbers of novel tumor markers even in tumors such as and biliary adenocarcinomas that characteristically have abundant desmoplastic stroma In addition novel tumor markers of adenocarcinomas show similar yet not identical expression patterns in biliary carcinomas Therefore these markers are potentially useful in developing diagnostic tests and treatment paradigms for tumors involving the biliary system,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[75, 1648, 145, 55, 318, 232, 229, 30, 525, 1711, 4, 2097, 1258, 1586, 1, 3, 47, 761, 85, 108, 137, 3, 55, 1, 46, 525, 4, 6204, 288, 1586, 1, 3, 2532, 4899, 71, 44, 85, 565, 3, 743, 1, 3, 364, 45, 10, 27, 1116, 157, 21, 95, 66, 525, 17, 47, 85, 443, 6, 40, 1711, 4, 902, 246, 3013, 1, 1586, 6, 2183, 246, 2774, 11278, 2466, 29, 8, 988, 1, 1586, 78, 806, 3, 3383, 764, 1, 49, 701, 525, 19632, 5258, 39, 213, 27, 43538, 452, 31, 448, 3999, 16352, 2, 8747, 18787, 11, 3610, 5, 373, 983, 94, 23, 902, 246, 3013, 1145, 616, 3272, 1497, 3830, 2, 9543, 5402, 35, 701, 952, 2, 3545, 3971, 178, 662, 8, 952, 1, 5432, 19633, 224, 280, 148, 1, 55, 4, 3, 11278, 198, 72, 5, 902, 246, 3013, 419, 21, 409, 3, 373, 860, 55, 1, 3, 827, 66, 229, 30, 652, 4, 163, 1, 3, 2532, 4899, 20, 75, 11278, 2466, 29, 8, 988, 1, 3022, 9386, 1586, 2, 1586, 1, 3, 2107, 186, 2920, 78, 519, 296, 1, 3, 66, 525, 10, 1711, 4, 3, 2532, 163, 2223, 29, 213, 2219, 28, 506, 2137, 3383, 5, 452, 31, 448, 6, 394, 3383, 5, 8747, 18787, 96, 1, 3, 525, 224, 280, 2722, 1, 55, 4, 3, 2532, 1696, 826, 4, 1155, 6, 3, 1586, 4, 352, 55, 764, 2051, 5, 1147, 4, 3, 2532, 398, 3022, 185, 185, 2107, 186, 2920, 46, 362, 11, 712, 93, 19, 13, 474, 9, 5402, 5258, 39, 2, 3545, 3971, 178, 662, 1368, 3, 55, 1, 715, 525, 4, 2000, 91, 1, 12, 10, 409, 100, 525, 19632, 2, 5402, 224, 126, 863, 1, 55, 5, 1970, 29, 134, 4, 957, 6, 416, 449, 7912, 8, 200, 9, 46, 525, 4, 2000, 91, 3, 99, 1, 26, 45, 1008, 17, 5501, 2033, 777, 4406, 2, 835, 323, 2263, 6, 2413, 375, 1870, 1, 229, 30, 525, 871, 4, 57, 225, 22, 2, 2532, 1586, 17, 14079, 47, 4834, 5922, 2477, 4, 352, 229, 30, 525, 1, 1586, 514, 288, 1145, 44, 3038, 55, 764, 4, 2532, 826, 673, 46, 525, 32, 751, 999, 4, 931, 752, 895, 2, 24, 4887, 9, 57, 1267, 3, 2532, 398]",2534.0,15017593,3
Major hepatectomy with simultaneous pancreatectomy for advanced hepatobiliary cancer.,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,J. Am. Coll. Surg.,2004-04-01,"Combined major hepatectomy with pancreatectomy (MHP) is a rarely used operation for the treatment of hepatobiliary cancer. Few reports have discussed the utility of this procedure and its indications are poorly defined. The aim of this study was to review our experience with MHP. A review of our prospective hepatobiliary surgical database between January 1994 and July 2000 identified 17 patients who had undergone MHP. Preoperative radiographic and laboratory data, intraoperative findings, hospital outcomes, and longterm followup were obtained. A total of 3,579 patients with hepatobiliary malignancy were seen at our institution, of which 1,280 underwent resection and 17 (1.3%) had an MHP. The median age was 58 years (range 24 to 76). Histology was as follows: eight neuroendocrine carcinoma, three sarcoma, two cholangiocarcinoma, one ampullary carcinoma, one gallbladder carcinoma, one gastric carcinoma recurrence, and one benign fibrosis. All 17 patients underwent resection of two or more hepatic segments. Nine patients underwent a distal pancreatectomy and eight underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy. Median operative time was 6 hours (range 4 to 8) and the median blood loss was 900 mL (range 150 to 2,500). Postoperative complications occurred in eight patients (47%), and there were three perioperative deaths (18%).

"Expression of neuropilin-1 in high-grade dysplasia, invasive cancer, and metastases of the human gastrointestinal tract.",The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2004-03-01,"Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) functions as an axonal guidance molecule in the developing nervous system, and recent work has identified NRP-1 up-regulation in several cancers, including neuroblastomas and breast carcinoma. We examined for the first time NRP-1 expression in a large variety of gastrointestinal carcinomas and precursor lesions to determine whether NRP-1 up-regulation correlated with invasive growth in this system. Protein expression and localization of NRP-1 were studied by immunolabeling and semiquantification in >300 dysplastic, invasive, and metastatic lesions of the gastrointestinal tract, and confirmation of NRP-1 protein expression was performed by Western blot analysis on pancreatic cancer cell lines. NRP-1 expression was limited within normal tissues of the gastrointestinal tract, with prominent labeling present only in endothelial cells, pancreatic islet cells, and the most apical colonic epithelium. Invasive cancer of the esophagus, gallbladder, ampulla of Vater, pancreas (endocrine and exocrine), and colon, however, all demonstrated striking NRP-1 expression. NRP-1 was also identified in precursor lesions of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, such as Barrett esophagus and colorectal adenomas. Within the spectrum of precursor lesions, a progressive increase in both intensity and area of expression was evident during histologic progression from low-grade to high-grade dysplasia. Notably, the most intense up-regulation of NRP-1 was apparent at or around the point of invasion, with focal expression of NRP-1 at levels equivalent to the invasive cancer (2- to 3-fold increase). Prominent labeling for NRP-1 was apparent in primary invasive cancers, liver metastases, and a subset of lymph node metastases, with a 2- to 3-fold increase of NRP-1 over dysplastic lesions. We conclude that increased expression of NRP-1 occurs in gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and in a subset of high-grade precursor lesions. This up-regulation appears to parallel invasive behavior and may therefore be used as a potential marker for cancer aggressiveness in this system.",Journal Article,5804.0,111.0,Neuropilin-1 NRP-1 functions as an axonal guidance molecule in the developing nervous system and recent work has identified NRP-1 up-regulation in several cancers including neuroblastomas and carcinoma We examined for the first time NRP-1 expression in a large variety of carcinomas and precursor lesions to determine whether NRP-1 up-regulation correlated with invasive growth in this system Protein expression and localization of NRP-1 were studied by immunolabeling and semiquantification in 300 dysplastic invasive and metastatic lesions of the tract and confirmation of NRP-1 protein expression was performed by Western blot analysis on cancer cell lines NRP-1 expression was limited within normal tissues of the tract with prominent labeling present only in endothelial cells islet cells and the most apical colonic epithelium Invasive cancer of the ampulla of Vater endocrine and exocrine and however all demonstrated striking NRP-1 expression NRP-1 was also identified in precursor lesions of adenocarcinomas such as Barrett and adenomas Within the spectrum of precursor lesions a progressive increase in both intensity and area of expression was evident during histologic progression from low-grade to high-grade dysplasia Notably the most intense up-regulation of NRP-1 was apparent at or around the point of invasion with focal expression of NRP-1 at levels equivalent to the invasive cancer 2- to 3-fold increase Prominent labeling for NRP-1 was apparent in primary invasive cancers metastases and a subset of lymph node metastases with a 2- to 3-fold increase of NRP-1 over dysplastic lesions We conclude that increased expression of NRP-1 occurs in adenocarcinomas and in a subset of high-grade precursor lesions This up-regulation appears to parallel invasive behavior and may therefore be used as a potential marker for cancer aggressiveness in this system,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[15253, 14, 11164, 14, 1681, 22, 35, 17257, 2753, 1354, 4, 3, 931, 1880, 398, 2, 435, 1357, 71, 108, 11164, 14, 126, 863, 4, 392, 163, 141, 8915, 2, 134, 21, 409, 9, 3, 157, 98, 11164, 14, 55, 4, 8, 375, 1362, 1, 826, 2, 2765, 406, 6, 223, 317, 11164, 14, 126, 863, 438, 5, 416, 129, 4, 26, 398, 178, 55, 2, 2145, 1, 11164, 14, 11, 656, 20, 21238, 2, 54129, 4, 2036, 6461, 416, 2, 113, 406, 1, 3, 1696, 2, 3551, 1, 11164, 14, 178, 55, 10, 173, 20, 1521, 2639, 65, 23, 12, 31, 285, 11164, 14, 55, 10, 383, 262, 295, 742, 1, 3, 1696, 5, 3689, 3383, 364, 158, 4, 845, 37, 7475, 37, 2, 3, 96, 9238, 3663, 2781, 416, 12, 1, 3, 12837, 1, 14777, 1293, 2, 12774, 2, 137, 62, 264, 5133, 11164, 14, 55, 11164, 14, 10, 120, 108, 4, 2765, 406, 1, 1586, 225, 22, 4366, 2, 2751, 262, 3, 1873, 1, 2765, 406, 8, 1014, 344, 4, 110, 837, 2, 965, 1, 55, 10, 2853, 190, 884, 91, 29, 154, 88, 6, 64, 88, 2253, 2552, 3, 96, 3933, 126, 863, 1, 11164, 14, 10, 2235, 28, 15, 3337, 3, 741, 1, 578, 5, 2137, 55, 1, 11164, 14, 28, 148, 2017, 6, 3, 416, 12, 18, 6, 27, 1116, 344, 3689, 3383, 9, 11164, 14, 10, 2235, 4, 86, 416, 163, 196, 2, 8, 697, 1, 263, 289, 196, 5, 8, 18, 6, 27, 1116, 344, 1, 11164, 14, 252, 6461, 406, 21, 2060, 17, 101, 55, 1, 11164, 14, 1780, 4, 1586, 2, 4, 8, 697, 1, 64, 88, 2765, 406, 26, 126, 863, 1233, 6, 2755, 416, 1710, 2, 68, 673, 40, 95, 22, 8, 174, 952, 9, 12, 3908, 4, 26, 398]",1872.0,15104297,77
Surgical management of cholangiocarcinoma.,Seminars in liver disease,Semin. Liver Dis.,2004-05-01,"Biliary tract cancer affects approximately 7500 Americans each year. Tumors arising from the gallbladder are the most common; those of bile duct origin, or cholangiocarcinoma, are less frequently encountered, constituting approximately 2% of all reported cancers. Although cholangiocarcinoma can arise anywhere within the biliary tree, tumors involving the biliary confluence (i.e., hilar cholangiocarcinoma) represent the majority, accounting for 40 to 60% of all cases. Twenty to 30% of cholangiocarcinomas originate in the lower bile duct, and approximately 10% arise within the intrahepatic biliary tree and will present as an intrahepatic mass. Complete resection remains the most effective and only potentially curative therapy for cholangiocarcinoma. For all patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and nearly all patients with hilar tumors, complete resection requires a major partial hepatectomy. Distal cholangiocarcinomas, on the other hand, are treated like all periampullary malignancies and typically require pancreaticoduodenectomy.

A 4-week course included 1000 mg/m2 gemcitabine by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15, 25 mg/m2 LV by intravenous push, and 600 mg/m2 5-FU by intravenous push after LV. Forty-two patients were enrolled in 6 months, 35 of whom had metastatic disease. Patients with biliary tract ACA included 24 with hepatic disease (19 patients had intrahepatic disease and 5 patients had extrahepatic disease) and 4 with disease in the ampulla of Vater. All patients were evaluable and received a median of 4 courses of treatment (range, 1-21 courses). Commonly occurring severe toxicity (NCI CTC Grade 3 or worse) included: dyspnea (four patients), nausea (four patients), fatigue (seven patients), thrombocytopenia (six patients), emesis (four patients), and diarrhea (four patients). Five partial responses (9.5%) occurred, 3 of which were sustained for > or = 8 weeks. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Thirty-two patients had disease progression and 38 died after a median follow-up of 20 months (range, 1.4-24 months).

"Differential cell cycle-regulatory protein expression in biliary tract adenocarcinoma: correlation with anatomic site, pathologic variables, and clinical outcome.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2006-03-01,"Biliary tract adenocarcinomas (BTAs), although anatomically related, arise through ill-defined and possibly different location-related pathogenetic pathways. This clinicopathologic study characterizes differences in cell cycle-regulatory protein expression across the spectrum of BTA. Tissue microarrays were prepared from paraffin-embedded surgical specimens with triplicate cores of BTA and benign tissue. Immunohistochemical expression of p53, cyclin D1, p21, Bcl2, p27, Mdm2, and Ki-67 was assessed, and the results were correlated with pathologic variables and survival. Hierarchical clustering was used to partition the data based on protein expression, and then the data were analyzed according to anatomic location. Tissue from 128 surgical patients (1992 to 2002) was obtained. Tumor sites of origin were intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IH; n = 23), hilar cholangiocarcinoma (Hilar; n = 54), gallbladder (GB; n = 32), and distal bile duct (Distal; n = 19). p27 expression decreased progressively from proximal to distal in the biliary tree and correlated with location-related differences in outcome; cyclin D1 and Bcl2 overexpression also varied according to anatomic site. Aberrant p53 staining and cyclin D1 overexpression were lower in papillary tumors compared with the more common sclerosing tumors. The expression profiles of GB and Hilar were more similar to each other than either was to IH or Distal (86% clustering in the first partition).

Pharmacol.,2006-06-20,"S-1 is a novel oral fluoropyrimidine that combines tegafur with CDHP and oxonic acid. To decrease the incidence of late onset, severe diarrhea observed in a previous study, a phase I study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of S-1 utilizing a 14-day schedule, repeated every 21 days, in patients with chemotherapy-refractory upper gastrointestinal malignancies. S-1 was administered orally, twice-daily, at an initial dose level of 30 mg/m2/dose; doses were escalated by 5 mg/m2 at each level. A minimum of three patients were enrolled at each dose level. S-1 toxicity, antitumor activity, and pharmacokinetics were assessed. The MTD was based on the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first treatment cycle. At 30 mg/m2 no DLT was observed in the first three evaluable patients. Two of the first three patients at the 35 mg/m2 dose level developed DLTs (grade 3 rash and dehydration). An additional nine patients were subsequently treated at 30 mg/m2 without DLT and this dose was established as the MTD. Common toxicities at 30 mg/m2 included diarrhea, nausea, skin rash, anorexia, and fatigue. No grade 4 toxicities were observed. One partial response was seen in a patient with gemcitabine-refractory pancreatic adenocarcinoma and ten patients with pancreatic, gastric, or gallbladder carcinomas achieved stable disease as their best response to therapy. The AUC(0-8) of 5-FU at the 30 and 35 mg/m2 dose levels were 875 +/- 212 and 894 +/- 151 h ng/ml, respectively. In a 14-day dosing schedule, the MTD of S-1 was 30 mg/m2 and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity was seen in a North American population with refractory upper gastrointestinal malignancies.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",4963.0,28.0,S-1 is a novel oral fluoropyrimidine that combines tegafur with CDHP and oxonic acid To decrease the incidence of late onset severe diarrhea observed in a previous study a phase I study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose MTD of S-1 utilizing a 14-day schedule repeated every 21 days in patients with chemotherapy-refractory upper malignancies S-1 was administered orally twice-daily at an initial dose level of 30 mg/m2/dose doses were escalated by 5 mg/m2 at each level A minimum of three patients were enrolled at each dose level S-1 toxicity antitumor activity and pharmacokinetics were assessed The MTD was based on the dose limiting toxicity DLT during the first treatment cycle At 30 mg/m2 no DLT was observed in the first three evaluable patients Two of the first three patients at the 35 mg/m2 dose level developed DLTs grade 3 rash and dehydration An additional nine patients were subsequently treated at 30 mg/m2 without DLT and this dose was established as the MTD Common toxicities at 30 mg/m2 included diarrhea nausea rash anorexia and fatigue No grade 4 toxicities were observed One partial response was seen in a patient with gemcitabine-refractory adenocarcinoma and ten patients with or carcinomas achieved stable disease as their best response to therapy The AUC 0-8 of 5-FU at the 30 and 35 mg/m2 dose levels were 875 +/- 212 and 894 +/- 151 h ng/ml respectively In a 14-day dosing schedule the MTD of S-1 was 30 mg/m2 and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity was seen in a North American population with refractory upper malignancies,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[695, 14, 16, 8, 229, 518, 5464, 17, 6705, 18852, 5, 37373, 2, 55581, 971, 6, 775, 3, 287, 1, 807, 1707, 905, 1172, 164, 4, 8, 698, 45, 8, 124, 70, 45, 10, 426, 6, 223, 3, 689, 421, 61, 961, 1, 695, 14, 2600, 8, 213, 218, 1055, 2113, 454, 239, 162, 4, 7, 5, 56, 430, 1726, 441, 695, 14, 10, 468, 1428, 936, 391, 28, 35, 388, 61, 301, 1, 201, 81, 821, 61, 415, 11, 2842, 20, 33, 81, 821, 28, 296, 301, 8, 2499, 1, 169, 7, 11, 346, 28, 296, 61, 301, 695, 14, 155, 579, 128, 2, 1159, 11, 275, 3, 961, 10, 90, 23, 3, 61, 817, 155, 2059, 190, 3, 157, 24, 417, 28, 201, 81, 821, 77, 2059, 10, 164, 4, 3, 157, 169, 859, 7, 100, 1, 3, 157, 169, 7, 28, 3, 465, 81, 821, 61, 301, 276, 2506, 88, 27, 1641, 2, 5414, 35, 402, 762, 7, 11, 1611, 73, 28, 201, 81, 821, 187, 2059, 2, 26, 61, 10, 635, 22, 3, 961, 186, 385, 28, 201, 81, 821, 159, 1172, 1218, 1641, 3373, 2, 613, 77, 88, 39, 385, 11, 164, 104, 450, 51, 10, 527, 4, 8, 69, 5, 679, 430, 449, 2, 1618, 7, 5, 15, 826, 513, 585, 34, 22, 136, 824, 51, 6, 36, 3, 1376, 13, 66, 1, 33, 1296, 28, 3, 201, 2, 465, 81, 821, 61, 148, 11, 14279, 6586, 2, 13341, 5075, 555, 997, 542, 106, 4, 8, 213, 218, 1280, 1055, 3, 961, 1, 695, 14, 10, 201, 81, 821, 2, 1676, 241, 1, 579, 128, 10, 527, 4, 8, 2669, 597, 266, 5, 430, 1726, 441]",1578.0,16786333,55

Gallbladder cancer: the role of laparoscopy and radical resection.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2007-06-01,"We assess how laparoscopy has altered the presentation of patients with gallbladder cancer and determine whether radical resection in patients with gallbladder cancer is beneficial. The widespread adoption of laparoscopic cholecystectomy has led to an increased frequency of incidentally discovered gallbladder carcinoma. Little data exist to guide surgeons in the optimum management of patients with gallbladder cancer, particularly with respect to the potential advantages of radical resection. Records of 107 patients with gallbladder cancer admitted to a tertiary academic medical center between 1995 and 2004 were reviewed. Gallbladder cancer was found incidentally in 53 patients (50%). Fifty-two of these patients underwent a routine laparoscopic cholecystectomy and were found to have gallbladder cancer intraoperatively or following the operation by subsequent pathologic evaluation of the specimen. Gallbladder cancer had been diagnosed preoperatively by radiology in the other 54 patients (50%). These patients did not undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy and were explored electively. The median age at presentation was 67 years and 66% were female. Patients who were found to have gallbladder carcinoma incidentally at laparoscopic cholecystectomy had a significant increase in survival when compared with those who were admitted electively with a known diagnosis (P < 0.001). All patients who presented with a known diagnosis had stage II or greater disease, and 36% of these were stage IV carcinomas. However, 82% of those patients who were found incidentally were stage I or II. The overall 5-year survival for all patients was 15%; those discovered incidentally at laparoscopic cholecystectomy had a 5-year survival of 33%. This difference was significant among patients with stage II carcinomas. In the laparoscopic group, there was no difference in survival between the patients who were immediately converted to an open resection when identified to have gallbladder cancer intraoperatively (n = 6) and those who had a completed laparoscopic cholecystectomy and were re-explored at a later point when found to have gallbladder cancer by subsequent pathology (n = 33). There was a significant improvement in survival in 50 patients (47%) who underwent some form of radical resection (P < 0.001). Stage for stage comparison showed that this was significant in stage II disease. Patients who underwent hepatic resection along with lymphadenectomy and extra hepatic biliary resection had similar survival compared with those who had hepatic resection and lymphadenectomy alone. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy appears to have resulted in the earlier discovery of gallbladder cancer in some patients, resulting in increased probability of survival. Patients discovered with gallbladder carcinoma during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy do not have to be converted immediately to an open resection and should be referred to a tertiary care center for further exploration. Adjunctive radical surgical resection, either at the time of cholecystectomy or subsequently, increases survival significantly in early stage disease.",Journal Article,4617.0,139.0,We assess how laparoscopy has altered the presentation of patients with cancer and determine whether radical resection in patients with cancer is beneficial The widespread adoption of laparoscopic cholecystectomy

Phase-II study of gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with metastatic biliary and gallbladder cancer.,Digestive diseases and sciences,Dig. Dis. Sci.,2007-06-29,"There is no standard chemotherapy option for patients with biliary tract cancers. These patients present fairly ill and can have a rapid progression of disease. We conducted a multi-center, phase-II trial for patients with locally unresectable or metastatic bile duct or gallbladder adenocarcinomas using a modified regimen of gemcitabine and cisplatin to potentially improve tolerability. Patients received a 21-day treatment cycle of gemcitabine at 1,000 mg/m2 and cisplatin at 30 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8. To participate, 33 patients signed informed consent, and 30 patients received at least one dose of chemotherapy. By intention-to-treat analyses, 7 patients (21%) experienced a partial response and another 12 (36%) had stable disease for at least 12 weeks. The median progression-free survival was 6.3 months and median overall survival was 9.7 months. After 1 year, 39% of patients were alive. Most common grade 3-4 toxicities included neutropenia (33%), thrombocytopenia (23%), anemia (20%), nausea (20%), emesis (13%) and fatigue (10%). Of note, 52% of patients withdrew from study treatment, principally due to treatment-related adverse events. We concluded that this modified regimen appeared to have comparable activity to other gemcitabine and cisplatin regimens against advanced bile duct and gallbladder cancers, but there was still moderate toxicity in this patient population.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",4589.0,45.0,"There is no standard chemotherapy option for patients with biliary tract cancers These patients present fairly ill and can have a rapid progression of disease We conducted a multi-center phase-II trial for patients with locally unresectable or metastatic duct or adenocarcinomas using a modified regimen of gemcitabine and cisplatin to potentially improve tolerability Patients received a 21-day treatment cycle of gemcitabine at 1,000 mg/m2 and cisplatin at 30 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 To participate 33 patients signed informed consent and 30 patients received at least one dose of chemotherapy By intention-to-treat analyses 7 patients 21 experienced a partial response and another 12 36 had stable disease for at least 12 weeks The median progression-free survival was 6.3 months and median overall survival was 9.7 months After 1 year 39 of patients were alive Most common grade 3-4 toxicities included neutropenia 33 thrombocytopenia 23 anemia 20 nausea 20 emesis 13 and fatigue 10 Of note 52 of patients withdrew from study treatment principally due to treatment-related adverse events We concluded that this modified regimen appeared to have comparable activity to other gemcitabine and cisplatin regimens against advanced duct and cancers but there was still moderate toxicity in this patient population",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[125, 16, 77, 260, 56, 1501, 9, 7, 5, 2532, 1696, 163, 46, 7, 364, 9971, 4993, 2, 122, 47, 8, 1321, 91, 1, 34, 21, 426, 8, 1414, 574, 124, 215, 160, 9, 7, 5, 795, 1468, 15, 113, 2920, 15, 1586, 75, 8, 1230, 477, 1, 679, 2, 540, 6, 751, 401, 1543, 7, 103, 8, 239, 218, 24, 417, 1, 679, 28, 14, 984, 81, 821, 2, 540, 28, 201, 81, 821, 23, 162, 14, 2, 66, 6, 3506, 466, 7, 7717, 2767, 3844, 2, 201, 7, 103, 28, 506, 104, 61, 1, 56, 20, 3205, 6, 943, 318, 67, 7, 239, 592, 8, 450, 51, 2, 1809, 133, 511, 42, 585, 34, 9, 28, 506, 133, 244, 3, 52, 91, 115, 25, 10, 49, 27, 53, 2, 52, 63, 25, 10, 83, 67, 53, 50, 14, 111, 587, 1, 7, 11, 1701, 96, 186, 88, 27, 39, 385, 159, 778, 466, 1340, 382, 1545, 179, 1218, 179, 6899, 233, 2, 613, 79, 1, 5739, 653, 1, 7, 7939, 29, 45, 24, 10257, 520, 6, 24, 139, 290, 281, 21, 4724, 17, 26, 1230, 477, 2121, 6, 47, 1279, 128, 6, 127, 679, 2, 540, 472, 480, 131, 2920, 2, 163, 84, 125, 10, 1234, 1163, 155, 4, 26, 69, 266]",1309.0,17597402,76
Incidence of finding residual disease for incidental gallbladder carcinoma: implications for re-resection.,Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,J. Gastrointest. Surg.,2007-09-11,"Re-resection for gallbladder carcinoma incidentally discovered after cholecystectomy is routinely advocated. However, the incidence of finding additional disease at the time of re-resection remains poorly defined. Between 1984 and 2006, 115 patients underwent re-resection at six major hepatobiliary centers for gallbladder carcinoma incidentally discovered during cholecystectomy. Data on clinicopathologic factors, operative details, TNM tumor stage, and outcome were collected and analyzed. Data on the incidence and location of residual/additional carcinoma discovered at the time of re-resection were also recorded. On pathologic analysis, T stage was T1 7.8%, T2 67.0%, and T3 25.2%. The median time from cholecystectomy to re-resection was 52 days. At the time of re-resection, hepatic surgery most often consisted of formal segmentectomy (64.9%). Patients underwent lymphadenectomy (LND) (50.5%) or LND + common bile duct resection (43.3%). The median number of lymph nodes harvested was 3 and did not differ between LND alone (n = 3) vs LND + common duct resection (n = 3) (P = 0.35). Pathology from the re-resection specimen noted residual/additional disease in 46.4% of patients. Of those patients staged as T1, T2, or T3, 0, 10.4, and 36.4%, respectively, had residual disease within the liver (P = 0.01). T stage was also associated with the risk of metastasis to locoregional lymph nodes (lymph node metastasis: T1 12.5%; T2 31.3%, T3 45.5%; P = 0.04). Cystic duct margin status predicted residual disease in the common bile duct (negative cystic duct, 4.3% vs positive cystic duct, 42.1%) (P = 0.01). Aggressive re-resection for incidental gallbladder carcinoma is warranted as the majority of patients have residual disease. Although common duct resection does not yield a greater lymph node count, it should be performed at the time of re-resection for patients with positive cystic duct margins because over one-third will have residual disease in the common bile duct.",Journal Article,4515.0,153.0,Re-resection for carcinoma incidentally discovered after cholecystectomy is routinely advocated However the incidence of finding additional disease at the time of re-resection remains poorly defined Between 1984 and 2006 115 patients underwent re-resection at six major hepatobiliary centers for carcinoma incidentally discovered during cholecystectomy Data on clinicopathologic factors operative details TNM tumor stage and outcome were collected and analyzed Data on the incidence and location of residual/additional carcinoma discovered at the time of re-resection were also recorded On pathologic analysis T stage was T1 7.8 T2 67.0 and T3 25.2 The median time from cholecystectomy to re-resection was 52 days At the time of re-resection hepatic surgery most often consisted of formal segmentectomy 64.9 Patients underwent lymphadenectomy LND 50.5 or LND common duct resection 43.3 The median number of lymph nodes harvested was 3 and did not differ between LND alone n 3 vs LND common duct resection n 3 P 0.35 Pathology from the re-resection specimen noted residual/additional disease in 46.4 of patients Of those patients staged as T1 T2 or T3 0 10.4 and 36.4 respectively had residual disease within the P 0.01 T stage was also associated with the risk of metastasis to locoregional lymph nodes lymph node metastasis T1 12.5 T2 31.3 T3 45.5 P 0.04 Cystic duct margin status predicted residual disease in the common duct negative cystic duct 4.3 vs positive cystic duct 42.1 P 0.01 Aggressive re-resection for incidental carcinoma is warranted as the majority of patients have residual disease Although common duct resection does not yield a greater lymph node count it should be performed at the time of re-resection for patients with positive cystic duct margins because over one-third will have residual disease in the common duct,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1491, 170, 9, 134, 5925, 2747, 50, 8493, 16, 3066, 8866, 137, 3, 287, 1, 1567, 402, 34, 28, 3, 98, 1, 1491, 170, 469, 1240, 395, 59, 6036, 2, 1324, 3670, 7, 208, 1491, 170, 28, 437, 458, 4718, 1168, 9, 134, 5925, 2747, 190, 8493, 74, 23, 1399, 130, 1208, 3791, 2918, 30, 82, 2, 228, 11, 786, 2, 311, 74, 23, 3, 287, 2, 1147, 1, 753, 402, 134, 2747, 28, 3, 98, 1, 1491, 170, 11, 120, 1872, 23, 510, 65, 102, 82, 10, 1534, 67, 66, 1786, 598, 13, 2, 2065, 243, 18, 3, 52, 98, 29, 8493, 6, 1491, 170, 10, 653, 162, 28, 3, 98, 1, 1491, 170, 939, 152, 96, 629, 1695, 1, 5057, 16767, 660, 83, 7, 208, 2048, 3400, 212, 33, 15, 3400, 186, 2920, 170, 601, 27, 3, 52, 207, 1, 263, 502, 6503, 10, 27, 2, 205, 44, 1505, 59, 3400, 279, 78, 27, 105, 3400, 186, 2920, 170, 78, 27, 19, 13, 465, 1117, 29, 3, 1491, 170, 2360, 1051, 753, 402, 34, 4, 641, 39, 1, 7, 1, 135, 7, 2930, 22, 1534, 1786, 15, 2065, 13, 79, 39, 2, 511, 39, 106, 42, 753, 34, 262, 3, 19, 13, 355, 102, 82, 10, 120, 41, 5, 3, 43, 1, 278, 6, 1325, 263, 502, 263, 289, 278, 1534, 133, 33, 1786, 456, 27, 2065, 512, 33, 19, 13, 755, 2965, 2920, 959, 156, 783, 753, 34, 4, 3, 186, 2920, 199, 2965, 2920, 39, 27, 105, 109, 2965, 2920, 595, 14, 19, 13, 355, 571, 1491, 170, 9, 4490, 134, 16, 1197, 22, 3, 686, 1, 7, 47, 753, 34, 242, 186, 2920, 170, 1097, 44, 2309, 8, 378, 263, 289, 1276, 192, 257, 40, 173, 28, 3, 98, 1, 1491, 170, 9, 7, 5, 109, 2965, 2920, 1012, 408, 252, 104, 1282, 303, 47, 753, 34, 4, 3, 186, 2920]",1840.0,17846848,51
Malignant gastroparesis: pathogenesis and management of an underrecognized disorder.,The journal of supportive oncology,J Support Oncol,2007-09-01,"Gastroparesis is a disorder of the stomach caused by delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Symptoms of gastroparesis include nausea, vomiting, early satiety, bloating, and abdominal discomfort. Gastroparesis has been described as a complication of several malignancies, including gastric, pancreatic, gallbladder, esophageal, and lung cancers, as well as leiomyosarcoma. The prevalence of malignant gastroparesis (MG) is unknown, and this entity is widely underrecognized and undertreated. Diabetes mellitus is the most common identifiable cause of benign gastroparesis, ie, gastroparesis occurring in the absence of an underlying malignant pathology. In the setting of malignancy, gastroparesis may result from the cancer itself or may be a complication of its treatment with such modalities as surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. Coexisting conditions, including diabetes, hypothyroidism, and neurologic diseases, may further exacerbate MG. The pathogenesis of MG is not clearly understood at present. However, mechanisms suggested in the literature include postvagotomy syndrome, malignant infiltration of the autonomic nervous system, and paraneoplastic dysmotility with autoantibody-mediated destruction of the enteric nervous system (the interstitial cells of Cajal, also called the intrinsic pacemaker of the gastrointestinal tract, or the myenteric plexus).

A phase I trial of gemcitabine in combination with patupilone in patients with advanced solid tumors.,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol.,2008-01-03,"Chemotherapy regimens including gemcitabine in combination with microtubule inhibitors such as docetaxel and paclitaxel have wide clinical application. Patupilone is a novel tubulin-polymerizing agent with activity against paclitaxel-resistant cell lines. We conducted a phase I trial to assess the maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and antitumor activity of gemcitabine and patupilone. Patients with refractory solid tumors enrolled in cohorts of three. Cohorts received fixed doses of gemcitabine (1,000 or 750 mg/m(2)) along with escalating doses of patupilone (1.5-3 mg/m(2)) on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. Twenty-seven patients received a total of 99 courses of treatment on study. Hematologic toxicity in the first cohort required a modification of the protocol to decrease the gemcitabine dose. Subsequent patients received gemcitabine 750 mg/m(2) and escalating doses of patupilone from 1.5 to 3 mg/m(2). DLTs were grade 3 asthenia and grade 3 dehydration. There was also one treatment-related death due to neutropenic infection. Other clinically significant toxicities were persistent asthenia and persistent nausea. Four patients, one each with pancreatic cancer, esophageal carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma, experienced a partial response. The dose-limiting toxicities of gemcitabine and patupilone were asthenia and dehydration. Dose reductions also occurred due to persistent fatigue that was not dose-limiting. However, patients with advanced malignancies were able to tolerate gemcitabine and patupilone at doses that resulted in clinical benefit. The recommended phase II dose for this schedule is gemcitabine 750 mg/m(2) and patupilone 1.5 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",4401.0,10.0,"Chemotherapy regimens including gemcitabine in combination with microtubule inhibitors such as docetaxel and paclitaxel have wide clinical application Patupilone is a novel tubulin-polymerizing agent with activity against paclitaxel-resistant cell lines We conducted a phase I trial to assess the maximum tolerated dose dose limiting toxicity DLT and antitumor activity of gemcitabine and patupilone Patients with refractory solid tumors enrolled in cohorts of three Cohorts received fixed doses of gemcitabine 1,000 or 750 mg/m 2 along with escalating doses of patupilone 1.5-3 mg/m 2 on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle Twenty-seven patients received a total of 99 courses of treatment on study Hematologic toxicity in the first cohort required a modification of the protocol to decrease the gemcitabine dose Subsequent patients received gemcitabine 750 mg/m 2 and escalating doses of patupilone from 1.5 to 3 mg/m 2 DLTs were grade 3 asthenia and grade 3 dehydration There was also one treatment-related death due to neutropenic infection Other clinically significant toxicities were persistent asthenia and persistent nausea Four patients one each with cancer carcinoma cholangiocarcinoma and carcinoma experienced a partial response The dose-limiting toxicities of gemcitabine and patupilone were asthenia and dehydration Dose reductions also occurred due to persistent fatigue that was not dose-limiting However patients with advanced malignancies were able to tolerate gemcitabine and patupilone at doses that resulted in clinical benefit The recommended phase II dose for this schedule is gemcitabine 750 mg/m 2 and patupilone 1.5 mg/m 2 on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[56, 472, 141, 679, 4, 150, 5, 4621, 222, 225, 22, 621, 2, 490, 47, 1019, 38, 1581, 9693, 16, 8, 229, 5303, 56802, 420, 5, 128, 480, 490, 436, 31, 285, 21, 426, 8, 124, 70, 160, 6, 423, 3, 689, 421, 61, 61, 817, 155, 2059, 2, 579, 128, 1, 679, 2, 9693, 7, 5, 430, 537, 57, 346, 4, 736, 1, 169, 736, 103, 1959, 415, 1, 679, 14, 984, 15, 4506, 81, 188, 18, 1510, 5, 2922, 415, 1, 9693, 14, 33, 27, 81, 188, 18, 23, 162, 14, 2, 66, 1, 8, 239, 218, 417, 737, 648, 7, 103, 8, 181, 1, 1058, 1993, 1, 24, 23, 45, 813, 155, 4, 3, 157, 180, 616, 8, 2437, 1, 3, 1182, 6, 775, 3, 679, 61, 706, 7, 103, 679, 4506, 81, 188, 18, 2, 2922, 415, 1, 9693, 29, 14, 33, 6, 27, 81, 188, 18, 2506, 11, 88, 27, 6230, 2, 88, 27, 5414, 125, 10, 120, 104, 24, 139, 273, 520, 6, 3659, 930, 127, 505, 93, 385, 11, 1882, 6230, 2, 1882, 1218, 294, 7, 104, 296, 5, 12, 134, 2126, 2, 134, 592, 8, 450, 51, 3, 61, 817, 385, 1, 679, 2, 9693, 11, 6230, 2, 5414, 61, 2153, 120, 489, 520, 6, 1882, 613, 17, 10, 44, 61, 817, 137, 7, 5, 131, 441, 11, 1665, 6, 5010, 679, 2, 9693, 28, 415, 17, 627, 4, 38, 247, 3, 793, 124, 215, 61, 9, 26, 1055, 16, 679, 4506, 81, 188, 18, 2, 9693, 14, 33, 81, 188, 18, 23, 162, 14, 2, 66, 1, 8, 239, 218, 417]",1677.0,18172649,131
MUC4 interacts with ErbB2 in human gallbladder carcinoma: potential pathobiological implications.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",Eur. J.

The expression of MUC4, the interaction of MUC4 with erbB2 and the status of erbB2 signalling in human gallbladder carcinomas were determined in order to gain a better understanding of the pathobiology. The expression levels of MUC4 protein and mRNA were increased in specimens of gallbladder carcinoma. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed an interaction between MUC4 and erbB2. This interaction was associated with the hyperphosphorylation of erbB2, MAPK and Akt and with the overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2. MUC4 was detected on the apical surface of cancerous epithelia and partially co-localised there with erbB2. Transfection experiments showed that MUC4 amplifies cell proliferation in the presence of heregulin through potentiating phosphorylation of erbB2 and its downstream signalling pathways.

Biliary sequelae following radioembolization with Yttrium-90 microspheres.,Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,J Vasc Interv Radiol,2008-03-17,"Yttrium-90 (90Y) radioembolization has emerged as a promising and safe therapeutic modality for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or metastatic liver cancer. The present report describes biliary sequelae following intraarterial 90Y therapy in patients with HCC or liver metastases. All patients were treated with 90Y therapy according to standard lobar treatment protocol. Pre- and posttreatment imaging, liver function tests, and serum total bilirubin measurements were performed. Three to 6 months after treatment, biliary sequelae were evaluated with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and any liver-related laboratory adverse events were noted. A total of 327 patients (HCC, n=190; liver metastases, n=137) received 569 infusions of 90Y. At follow-up imaging, 33 patients (10.1%; liver metastases, n=26; HCC, n=7) had 40 imaging findings related to the biliary tree, including biliary necrosis (n=17), biloma (n=3), cholecystitis (n=2), gallbladder wall enhancement (n=6), gallbladder wall rent (n=3), abscess (n=1), and stricture (n=8).

Systemic therapy for biliary tract cancers.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2008-04-01,"Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) are invasive carcinomas that arise from the epithelial lining of the gallbladder and bile ducts. These include intrahepatic, perihilar, and distal biliary tree cancers as well as carcinoma arising from the gallbladder. Complete surgical resection offers the only chance for cure; however, only 10% of patients present with early-stage disease and are considered surgical candidates. Among those patients who do undergo ""curative"" resection, recurrence rates are high; thus, for the majority of BTC patients, systemic chemotherapy is the mainstay of their treatment plan. Patients with unresectable or metastatic BTC have a poor prognosis, with a median overall survival time of <1 year.

Surg. Oncol.,2008-08-27,"Patients with resected extrahepatic bile duct adenocarcinoma who have microscopically positive resection margins and/or pathologic locoregional nodal involvement (R1pN1) have a high-risk of locoregional recurrence, and therefore, we advocate the use of adjuvant chemoradiation. To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of this treatment, we compared survival and side effects outcomes between such patients and patients with negative resection margins and pathologically negative nodes (R0pN0) who did not receive adjuvant treatment. Between 1984 and 2005, 65 patients were treated with curative-intended resection for extrahepatic bile duct adenocarcinoma. Patients with tumors arising in the gallbladder and periampullary region were excluded. Pathology and diagnostic images were centrally reviewed. Overall survival and locoregional recurrence outcomes for patients with standard-risk R0pN0 (surgery alone, or S group, n = 23) were compared with those of patients with high locoregional recurrence risk, R1 and/or pN1 (R1pN1) status who received adjuvant chemoradiation (S-CRT group, n = 42).

Analysis of the extent of resection for adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2008-11-05,"Gallbladder cancer has historically been considered an incurable malignancy; although, extended resection has been associated with cure in selected patients. However, the optimal extent of resection is unknown. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of the extent of resection for gallbladder adenocarcinoma on disease-specific survival (DSS) and perioperative morbidity. Analysis of a prospective hepatobiliary surgery database identified patients undergoing surgical resection for gallbladder adenocarcinoma from 1990 to 2002. Clinicopathologic factors including extent of resection were analyzed for their association with DSS and perioperative morbidity. Long-term outcome was evaluable in 104 patients. With median follow-up of 58 months for survivors, the actuarial 5-year DSS was 42%. Thirty-six patients (35%) underwent major hepatectomy, but in 15 this was not mandatory to clear all disease. Sixty-eight patients (65%) underwent common bile duct (CBD) excision, but 32 were performed empirically. Twenty-one patients (20%) underwent en bloc resection of adjacent organs other than the liver. The performance of a major hepatectomy or a CBD excision was not associated with other clinicopathologic variables or long-term survival. Resection of adjacent organs were associated with advanced T stage but not with survival. T stage, N stage, histologic differentiation, and CBD involvement were independently associated with survival.

Genome wide analysis and clinical correlation of chromosomal and transcriptional mutations in cancers of the biliary tract.,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res.,2009-05-12,"The pathogenesis of biliary cancers is ill-defined. This study investigates changes in gene expression and copy number in biliary cancers and correlates these changes with anatomical site of origin, histopathology and outcome. We performed gene expression and CGH analysis on 34 biliary tract cancer specimens. Results were confirmed by RT-PCR. Clinical-pathologic correlation was made using functional over-representation analysis of the top 100 mutations associated with each variable. There were 545 genes with altered expression in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, 2,354 in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and 1,281 in gallbladder cancer. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis indicated there was no difference in the global gene expression patterns between each biliary cancer subgroup. CGH analysis revealed that short segments of chromosomes 1p, 3p, 6q, 8p, 9p, and 14q were commonly deleted across all cancer subtypes. Commonly amplified regions included segments of 1q, 3q, 5p, 7p, 7q, 8q, and 20q.

Patients with infiltrative masses suspicious for gallbladder cancer were not included. Histologic findings were analyzed in patients who underwent cholecystectomy, and change in polyp size was determined in patients who underwent serial US imaging. From 1996 through 2007, 417 patients with PLG detected on US were identified. Two hundred twenty-nine patients (55%) were women, and median age was 59 years (range 20 to 94 years). Two hundred sixty-five patients (64%) were found to have PLG on US during the workup of other unrelated disease; 94 patients (23%) had abdominal symptoms. Ninety-four percent of patients had PLG< or =10 mm, and 7% had PLG>10 mm; 59% of patients had a single polyp and 12% had gallstones. Among 143 patients who had repeat US followup, growth was observed in only 8 patients (6%). Cholecystectomy (n=80) revealed that most patients had either pseudopolyps (58%) or no polyp (32%).

Evolving treatment strategies for gallbladder cancer.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2009-06-03,"Gallbladder cancer is an uncommon cancer that has traditionally been associated with a poor prognosis. In the era of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, incidental gallbladder cancer has dramatically increased and now constitutes the major way patients present with gallbladder cancer. While patients with incidental gallbladder cancer have a better survival than patients with nonincidental gallbladder cancer, incidental gallbladder cancer can be associated with a varied prognosis. Imaging with computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and [18]F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), as well as diagnostic laparoscopy, all have varying roles in the workup of patients with incidental gallbladder cancer. For patients with T1b, T2, and T3 incidental gallbladder cancer re-resection is generally recommended. At re-exploration, many patients with incidental gallbladder cancer will have residual disease. Definitive oncologic management requires re-resection of the liver, portal lymphadenectomy, and attention to the common bile duct. The extent of the hepatic resection should be dictated by the ability to achieve a microscopically negative (R0) margin. Routine resection of the common bile duct is unnecessary but should be undertaken in the setting of a positive cystic duct margin. If an incidental gallbladder cancer is discovered at the time of surgery, whether the surgeon should directly proceed with a more definitive oncologic operation should depend on the surgeon's skill-set and experience. Gallbladder cancer has a propensity to recur. Although data for adjuvant therapy following resection are limited, some data do suggest a survival benefit for adjuvant chemoradiation therapy.

Topoisomerase inhibitors have demonstrated synergy with platinum agents. We performed a phase I trial of combination RA with oxaliplatin in patients with refractory solid tumors. RA was administered as a 1-hour infusion daily on days 1-5 with oxaliplatin administered on day 5. Cycles were repeated every 21 days. A total of 17 patients were enrolled. The MTD for RA was 80 mg/m(2)/d for five days along with oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2) on day 5. Myelosuppression was a common occurrence but was mild except in one instance. Dose limiting toxicities included atrial fibrillation and hypophosphatemia. There was evidence of antitumor activity including 3 partial responses in patients with esophageal, gallbladder and hepato-cellular carcinoma; 5 additional patients had stable disease. Thus, the combination of RA and oxaliplatin is both tolerable and has evidence of clinical activity, but given the lack of significant activity for single agent RA across a variety of disease sites, it is unlikely to proceed to phase II development.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",3772.0,12.0,Rebeccamycin analog RA is an antitumor antibiotic with both topoisomerase I and II inhibiting activity Topoisomerase inhibitors have demonstrated synergy with platinum agents We performed a phase I trial of combination RA with oxaliplatin in patients with refractory solid tumors RA was administered as a 1-hour infusion daily on days 1-5 with oxaliplatin administered on day 5 Cycles were repeated every 21 days A total of 17 patients were enrolled The MTD for RA was 80 mg/m 2 /d for five days along with oxaliplatin 130 mg/m 2 on day 5 Myelosuppression was a common occurrence but was mild except in one instance Dose limiting toxicities included atrial fibrillation and hypophosphatemia There was evidence of antitumor activity including 3 partial responses in patients with and hepato-cellular carcinoma 5 additional patients had stable disease Thus the combination of RA and oxaliplatin is both tolerable and has evidence of clinical activity but given the lack of significant activity for single agent RA across a variety of disease sites it is unlikely to proceed to phase II development,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[22160, 3497, 4631, 16, 35, 579, 5210, 5, 110, 3999, 70, 2, 215, 2062, 128, 3999, 222, 47, 264, 3439, 5, 828, 183, 21, 173, 8, 124, 70, 160, 1, 150, 4631, 5, 1476, 4, 7, 5, 430, 537, 57, 4631, 10, 468, 22, 8, 14, 2583, 904, 391, 23, 162, 14, 33, 5, 1476, 468, 23, 218, 33, 410, 11, 2113, 454, 239, 162, 8, 181, 1, 269, 7, 11, 346, 3, 961, 9, 4631, 10, 493, 81, 188, 18, 427, 9, 365, 162, 1510, 5, 1476, 3431, 81, 188, 18, 23, 218, 33, 2858, 10, 8, 186, 2291, 84, 10, 1980, 2187, 4, 104, 10642, 61, 817, 385, 159, 7658, 9380, 2, 8021, 125, 10, 241, 1, 579, 128, 141, 27, 450, 253, 4, 7, 5, 2, 17970, 763, 134, 33, 402, 7, 42, 585, 34, 631, 3, 150, 1, 4631, 2, 1476, 16, 110, 2668, 2, 71, 241, 1, 38, 128, 84, 447, 3, 926, 1, 93, 128, 9, 226, 420, 4631, 716, 8, 1362, 1, 34, 633, 192, 16, 3568, 6, 6174, 6, 124, 215, 193]",1095.0,19774342,79

Women (n = 2,542) participating in a randomized diet trial completed a self-administered questionnaire regarding whether they were currently being treated for a wide variety of diseases (cardiovascular, diabetes, gallbladder, gastrointestinal, arthritis, and osteoporosis) and conditions (high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol level). Height and weight were measured at baseline. Participants were followed for a median of 7.3 years (range 0.8-15.0). Cox regression analysis was performed to assess whether comorbidities predicted disease-free and overall survival; hazard ratio (HR) was the measure of association. Overall, there were 406 additional breast cancer events and 242 deaths. Participants with diabetes had over twofold the risk of additional breast cancer events (HR 2.1, 95% CI: 1.3, 3.4) and mortality (HR 2.5, 95% CI: 1.4, 4.4).

The American Joint Committee on Cancer staging manual (sixth edition) states that histologic examination of at least 3 lymph nodes is required for adequate N stage determination for EHBDCA. This recommendation has not been validated; however, there has been no comparative assessment of the proximal versus distal bile duct cancer. A total of 257 patients (144 hilar cholangiocarcinoma [HCCA] and 113 distal bile duct adenocarcinoma [DBDCA]) who underwent curative intent resection (1987-2007) were analyzed; patients with gallbladder cancer were excluded. Final disease staging, including lymph node status and total number of nodes examined (total lymph node count), was obtained from the final pathology report. Differences in disease-specific survival, according to nodal status, were compared using the log-rank test. R1 resections (n = 51) were excluded from this analysis. Metastasis to regional lymph nodes was noted in 89 patients (34.6%) and was an independent prognostic factor of poor survival (median disease-specific survival N0 vs. N1: 53.5 vs. 19.3 months, P < 0.0001, hazard ratio = 2.1 [95% CI: 1.4-3.2]).

The estimated optimal total lymph node count for HCCA differed from that of DBDCA (n = 7 vs. n = 11, respectively).

Clin. Oncol.,2010-06-07,"Biliary cancers overexpress epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and angiogenesis has been correlated with poor outcome. Erlotinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and bevacizumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor have each been shown to have activity in biliary cancer. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), time to progression (TTP), VEGF levels, and molecular studies of EGFR and k-ras. Eligible patients had advanced cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder cancer. Patients were treated with bevacizumab 5 mg/kg intravenously on days 1 and 15 and erlotinib 150 mg by mouth daily on days 1 through 28. Responses were evaluated by RECIST. VEGF levels were collected, and samples were analyzed for EGFR mutation by polymerase chain reaction. Fifty-three eligible patients were enrolled at eight sites. Of 49 evaluable patients, six (12%; 95% CI, 6% to 27%) had a confirmed partial response. Stable disease was documented in another 25 patients (51%). Rash was the most common grade 3 toxicity. Four patients had grade 4 toxicities. Median OS was 9.9 months, and TTP was 4.4 months. Low repeats (< 16) in EGFR intron 1 polymorphism and G>G k-ras Q38 genotype (wild type) were associated with improved outcomes. Combination chemotherapy with bevacizumab and erlotinib showed clinical activity with infrequent grade 3 and 4 adverse effects in patients with advanced biliary cancers. On the basis of preliminary molecular analysis, presence of a k-ras mutation may alter erlotinib efficacy. The combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib may be a therapeutic alternative in patients with advanced biliary cancer.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",3515.0,161.0,Biliary cancers overexpress epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR and angiogenesis has been correlated with poor outcome Erlotinib an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and bevacizumab a vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF inhibitor have each been shown to have activity in biliary cancer The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors RECIST Secondary end points included overall survival OS time to progression TTP VEGF levels and molecular studies of EGFR and k-ras Eligible patients had advanced cholangiocarcinoma or cancer Patients were treated with bevacizumab 5 mg/kg intravenously on days 1 and 15 and erlotinib 150 mg by mouth daily on days 1 through 28 Responses were evaluated by RECIST VEGF levels were collected and samples were analyzed for EGFR mutation by polymerase chain reaction Fifty-three eligible patients were enrolled at eight sites Of 49 evaluable patients six 12 95 CI 6 to 27 had a confirmed partial response Stable disease was documented in another 25 patients 51 Rash was the most common grade 3 toxicity Four patients had grade 4 toxicities Median OS was 9.9 months and TTP was 4.4 months Low repeats 16 in EGFR intron 1 polymorphism and G G k-ras Q38 genotype wild type were associated with improved outcomes Combination chemotherapy with bevacizumab and erlotinib showed clinical activity with infrequent grade 3 and 4 adverse effects in patients with advanced biliary cancers On the basis of preliminary molecular analysis presence of a k-ras mutation may alter erlotinib efficacy The combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib may be a therapeutic alternative in patients with advanced biliary cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2532, 163, 5612, 829, 129, 161, 153, 227, 2, 1056, 71, 85, 438, 5, 334, 228, 962, 35, 227, 564, 216, 230, 2, 599, 8, 756, 845, 129, 161, 618, 230, 47, 296, 85, 443, 6, 47, 128, 4, 2532, 12, 3, 86, 461, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 376, 3, 51, 116, 20, 51, 451, 371, 4, 537, 57, 1834, 568, 396, 862, 159, 63, 25, 118, 98, 6, 91, 2422, 618, 148, 2, 219, 94, 1, 227, 2, 1634, 1102, 625, 7, 42, 131, 2126, 15, 12, 7, 11, 73, 5, 599, 33, 81, 503, 1672, 23, 162, 14, 2, 167, 2, 962, 1577, 81, 20, 5831, 391, 23, 162, 14, 298, 339, 253, 11, 194, 20, 1834, 618, 148, 11, 786, 2, 347, 11, 311, 9, 227, 258, 20, 1451, 1260, 1329, 1461, 169, 625, 7, 11, 346, 28, 659, 633, 1, 739, 859, 7, 437, 133, 48, 58, 49, 6, 428, 42, 8, 557, 450, 51, 585, 34, 10, 1405, 4, 1809, 243, 7, 725, 1641, 10, 3, 96, 186, 88, 27, 155, 294, 7, 42, 88, 39, 385, 52, 118, 10, 83, 83, 53, 2, 2422, 10, 39, 39, 53, 154, 7197, 245, 4, 227, 6259, 14, 1907, 2, 499, 499, 1634, 1102, 59041, 1183, 955, 267, 11, 41, 5, 231, 123, 150, 56, 5, 599, 2, 962, 224, 38, 128, 5, 4475, 88, 27, 2, 39, 290, 176, 4, 7, 5, 131, 2532, 163, 23, 3, 877, 1, 1676, 219, 65, 463, 1, 8, 1634, 1102, 258, 68, 2688, 962, 209, 3, 150, 1, 599, 2, 962, 68, 40, 8, 189, 1091, 4, 7, 5, 131, 2532, 12]",1704.0,20530271,146

Comparison of KRAS mutation analysis and FISH for detecting pancreatobiliary tract cancer in cytology specimens collected during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,J Mol Diagn,2010-09-23,"Pancreatobiliary tract strictures result either from malignancies of the biliary tract and pancreas or from nonmalignant etiopathogenesis. The goal of this study was to determine whether KRAS mutations could be identified in residual pancreatobiliary stricture brushings and to compare the performance characteristics of KRAS mutation analysis to cytology and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the detection of carcinoma. Residual brushing cytology cell pellets were retrieved from 132 patients with subsequent clinicopathologic follow-up of cholangiocarcinoma (n = 41), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n = 35), gallbladder cancer (n = 2), and nonmalignant strictures (n = 54). All specimens had a prior cytology and FISH UroVysion results as part of clinical practice. KRAS mutation analysis was performed using the quantitative PCR DxS KRAS Mutation Test Kit. KRAS mutation analysis was successful in 130 of 132 specimens. KRAS mutations and polysomic (ie, positive) FISH results were identified in 24 (69%) and 22 (63%) pancreatic adenocarcinoma specimens, respectively, with a combined sensitivity of 86% (30/35).

"Gallbladder cancer: differences in presentation, surgical treatment, and survival in patients treated at centers in three countries.",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,J. Am. Coll. Surg.,2010-11-12,"Gallbladder cancer (GBCA) is a rare malignancy with a variable incidence worldwide. This study analyzed GBCA patients treated at centers in 3 countries. The aim was to assess for location-specific differences in presentation and outcomes, which might suggest differences in pathogenesis or disease biology. Data for consecutive patients submitted to operation at Instituto Oncológico Fundación Arturo López Pérez (FALP, Chile), Yokohama City University (YCU, Japan), and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC, USA) between 1999 and 2007 were studied retrospectively. Patient demographics, disease- and treatment-related variables and outcomes were analyzed by chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, and log-rank test. Two hundred sixty-one patients (MSKCC, 130; FALP, 85; YCU, 46) underwent exploration, and 160 (MSKCC, 91; FALP, 33; YCU, 36) underwent R0 resection. Patients treated at FALP were younger (median 57 years, p < 0.001) and more often female (80%, p < 0.005); at YCU there were fewer patients with incidental tumors (19.5% compared with more than 60% at FALP and MSKCC, p < 0.001). En bloc liver and bile duct resections were performed more commonly at MSKCC and YCU (p < 0.001). Patients treated at FALP had more advanced tumor stage compared with those treated at MSKCC and YCU (p < 0.001). Disease-specific survival (DSS) was not different among the groups when patients submitted to an R0 resection were analyzed (p = 0.12). On multivariate analysis, T-stage, nodal involvement, and bile duct involvement were predictors of DSS; center was not significant.

Clinicopathological variables, including TNM stage, histologic tumor involvement of liver (residual or direct extension in the GB fossa or discontiguous disease), and the total number of regional LNs assessed were analyzed for their association with outcome. One hundred twenty-two patients were identified and analyzed. The median follow up period was 23 months. Liver and nodal involvement by GBCA were observed in 61 (50%) and 41(34%) patients, respectively. Among patients with T2 tumors (n = 53), 48 (91%) were incidental. Liver involvement was present in 26%, and this factor was associated with decreased recurrence-free (RFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) compared with patients with T2 tumors without liver involvement (median RFS, 12 months vs. not reached, P = 0.004, median DSS 25 months versus not reached, P = 0.003); T1b tumors (n = 10) were not associated with liver involvement. The median total lymph node count (TLNC) was 3 (range 0-20). For the entire cohort, survival of patients classified as N0 based on TLNC < 6 was significantly worse than that of N0 patients based on TLNC ≥ 6 (median RFS, 22 months versus not reached, P < 0.001, median DSS 41 months versus not reached, P < 0.001). Liver involvement and TLNC remained significant prognostic factors in a multivariate model that included TNM stage. Resection and histologic evaluation of at least 6 lymph nodes improves risk-stratification after resection of GBCA. Incidental T2 tumors are often associated with residual liver disease and should be reclassified to reflect the adverse outcome. The data suggests a need for standardized minimum requirements for adequate surgical treatment and pathological examination.",Comparative Study,3095.0,97.0,This study evaluates the significance of tumor involvement of the in early T-stage tumors and lymph node LN metastases on outcome after R0 resection of cancer GBCA A prospectively maintained database supplemented with review of the medical record was used to identify patients who underwent a complete R0 resection for GBCA All patients underwent definitive surgical treatment at the initial operation 1 stage or after initial noncurative cholecystectomy incidental tumors 2 stage including partial hepatectomy and portal LN dissection with or without duct and/or adjacent organ resection Clinicopathological variables including TNM stage histologic tumor involvement of residual or direct extension in the GB fossa or discontiguous disease and the total number of regional LNs assessed were analyzed for their association with outcome One hundred twenty-two patients were identified and analyzed The median follow up period was 23 months and nodal involvement by GBCA were observed in 61 50 and 41 34 patients respectively Among patients with T2 tumors n 53 48 91 were incidental involvement was present in 26 and this factor was associated with decreased recurrence-free RFS and disease-specific survival DSS compared with patients with T2 tumors without involvement median RFS 12 months vs. not reached P 0.004 median DSS 25 months versus not reached P 0.003 T1b tumors n 10 were not associated with involvement The median total lymph node count TLNC was 3 range 0-20 For the entire cohort survival of patients classified as N0 based on TLNC 6 was significantly worse than that of N0 patients based on TLNC ≥ 6 median RFS 22 months versus not reached P 0.001 median DSS 41 months versus not reached P 0.001 involvement and TLNC remained significant prognostic factors in a multivariate model that included TNM stage Resection and histologic evaluation of at least 6 lymph nodes improves risk-stratification after resection of GBCA Incidental T2 tumors are often associated with residual disease and should be reclassified to reflect the adverse outcome The data suggests a need for standardized minimum requirements for adequate surgical treatment and pathological examination,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[26, 45, 4941, 3, 724, 1, 30, 799, 1, 3, 4, 191, 102, 82, 57, 2, 263, 289, 1763, 196, 23, 228, 50, 2328, 170, 1, 12, 9894, 8, 1143, 1955, 609, 7687, 5, 206, 1, 3, 484, 3237, 10, 95, 6, 255, 7, 54, 208, 8, 236, 2328, 170, 9, 9894, 62, 7, 208, 1057, 221, 24, 28, 3, 388, 2589, 14, 82, 15, 50, 388, 15957, 8493, 4490, 57, 18, 82, 141, 450, 2711, 2, 3307, 1763, 1161, 5, 15, 187, 2920, 2, 15, 2086, 1259, 170, 2721, 682, 141, 2918, 82, 884, 30, 799, 1, 753, 15, 1196, 2401, 4, 3, 7832, 5100, 15, 33214, 34, 2, 3, 181, 207, 1, 951, 2704, 275, 11, 311, 9, 136, 248, 5, 228, 104, 1128, 737, 100, 7, 11, 108, 2, 311, 3, 52, 166, 126, 727, 10, 382, 53, 2, 779, 799, 20, 9894, 11, 164, 4, 713, 212, 2, 605, 562, 7, 106, 107, 7, 5, 1786, 57, 78, 699, 576, 970, 11, 4490, 799, 10, 364, 4, 432, 2, 26, 161, 10, 41, 5, 340, 146, 115, 1272, 2, 34, 112, 25, 1788, 72, 5, 7, 5, 1786, 57, 187, 799, 52, 1272, 133, 53, 105, 44, 1300, 19, 13, 1520, 52, 1788, 243, 53, 185, 44, 1300, 19, 13, 1421, 6142, 57, 78, 79, 11, 44, 41, 5, 799, 3, 52, 181, 263, 289, 1276, 29160, 10, 27, 184, 13, 179, 9, 3, 1797, 180, 25, 1, 7, 1373, 22, 3394, 90, 23, 29160, 49, 10, 97, 639, 76, 17, 1, 3394, 7, 90, 23, 29160, 749, 49, 52, 1272, 350, 53, 185, 44, 1300, 19, 13, 144, 52, 1788, 605, 53, 185, 44, 1300, 19, 13, 144, 799, 2, 29160, 958, 93, 177, 130, 4, 8, 331, 202, 17, 159, 2918, 82, 170, 2, 884, 451, 1, 28, 506, 49, 263, 502, 1804, 43, 1541, 50, 170, 1, 9894, 4490, 1786, 57, 32, 629, 41, 5, 753, 34, 2, 257, 40, 7864, 6, 2694, 3, 290, 228, 3, 74, 844, 8, 594, 9, 1670, 2499, 4230, 9, 1658, 221, 24, 2, 1301, 1385]",2179.0,21617582,145

This study evaluates the utility of SL with the aim of identifying variables associated with disseminated disease (DD). Consecutive patients with IGBC who underwent re-exploration between 1998 and 2009 were identified from a prospective database. The yield and accuracy of SL were calculated. Demographics, tumour- and treatment-related variables were correlated with findings of DD. Of the 136 patients submitted to re-exploration for possible definitive resection, 19 (14.0%) had DD. Staging laparoscopy was carried out in 46 (33.8%) patients, of whom 10 (21.8%) had DD (peritoneal disease [n = 6], liver metastases [n = 3], retroperitoneal disease [n = 1]). Disseminated disease was identified by SL in two patients (yield = 4.3%), whereas eight were diagnosed after conversion to laparotomy (accuracy = 20.0%). The likelihood of DD correlated closely with T-stage (T1b, n = 0; T2, n = 5 [7.0%], T3, n = 14 [26.0%]; P = 0.004). A positive margin at initial cholecystectomy (odds ratio [OR] 5.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.51-24.37; P = 0.004) and tumour differentiation (OR 7.64, 95% CI 1.1-NA; P= 0.006) were independent predictors of DD on multivariate analysis.

Is port site resection necessary in the surgical management of gallbladder cancer?,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2011-06-23,"In selected patients with incidental gallbladder carcinoma (GBCA) diagnosed after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), definitive resection is warranted. Port site excision has been advocated but remains controversial. Patients with GBCA were identified through institutional/departmental databases. The subset of patients with incidental tumors identified after LC and submitted to definitive surgical therapy were selected. Those subjected to port site resection were compared with patients who underwent resection without port site removal and analyzed for differences in recurrence patterns and survival. From 1992 to 2009, 113 patients with incidental GBCA presented for definitive resection after LC; 69 patients had port site resection and 44 did not. In the resected port site group, depth of tumor invasion was T1b = 6, T2 = 35, T3 = 28, and 13 (19%) had port site metastases. Port site disease was seen only in patients with T2 or T3 tumors and correlated with the development of peritoneal metastases (P = 0.01). Median survival of patients with T2/T3 tumors without port site metastases was 42 months compared to 17 months in patients with port site disease (P = 0.005). When only R0 resected patients were compared and adjusted for T and N stage, port site resection was not associated with overall survival (P = 0.23) or recurrence-free survival (P = 0.69).

Eligible patients had no prior therapy for metastatic or unresectable disease. Sorafenib was administered at 400 mg po twice daily continuously. The study was terminated after the first stage of accrual due to failure to meet the primary objective. A confirmed response rate of 0% (0%-11%) was observed. Thirty-nine percent of patients demonstrated stable disease (including 2 with unconfirmed PR). PFS was 3 months (95% CI: 2-4 months) and OS 9 months (95% CI: 4-12 months). The most common grade 3 and 4 toxicities included hand-foot skin reaction (13%), bilirubin elevation (13%), venous thromboembolism (10%), AST/ALT elevation (10%) and elevated alkaline phosphatase (10%).

Randomized trial of tamoxifen versus combined tamoxifen and octreotide LAR Therapy in the adjuvant treatment of early-stage breast cancer in postmenopausal women: NCIC CTG MA.14.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2011-09-12,"Somatostatin analogs act directly on breast cancer cells and indirectly on insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels. This trial was undertaken to assess whether octreotide would lower insulin and IGF-1 levels and reduce risk of breast cancer recurrence. The NCIC CTG MA.14 (NCIC Clinical Trials Group MA.14) trial randomly assigned postmenopausal women to 5 years of tamoxifen 20 mg daily (TAM) or TAM plus 2 years of octreotide 90 mg depot intramuscular injections monthly (TAM-OCT) as adjuvant therapy. The primary end point was event-free survival (EFS). Secondary end points were relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), toxicity, and effects of treatment on IGF physiology. Among 667 women with a median follow-up of 7.9 years, 220 events occurred-108 with TAM-OCT and 112 with TAM. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs; TAM-OCT to TAM) were 0.93 for EFS (95% CI, 0.71 to 1.22; P = .62), 0.84 for RFS (95% CI, 0.59 to 1.18; P = .31), and 0.97 for OS (95% CI, 0.69 to 1.37; P = .86). Among patients with normal baseline gallbladder imaging, cholecystectomy was required in 23.0% of those receiving TAM-OCT but in only 1.4% of those receiving TAM (P < .001). At 4 months, TAM-OCT had significantly (P < .001) lowered IGF-1, IGF binding protein 3, and C-peptide levels.

Pathology reports for 1992-2010 were reviewed for patients with high-grade dysplasia of the cystic duct margin in the absence of invasive gallbladder cancer. Clinical data were obtained from chart review. Five patients with high-grade dysplasia at the cystic duct margin without evidence of malignancy were identified. Radiologic imaging was abnormal in two patients. The cystic duct stump was abnormally dilated in both patients and one patient had an enlarged portacaval lymph node. All five patients underwent exploration and resection of either the cystic duct stump or the bile duct. Specimens in four of the patients showed no evidence of malignancy or dysplasia. One patient was found to have a node-positive adenocarcinoma of the cystic duct. High-grade dysplasia at the cystic duct margin without evidence of invasive gallbladder cancer is rare.

Gallbladder lesions identified on ultrasound. Lessons from the last 10 years.,Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,J. Gastrointest. Surg.,2011-11-23,"Possible mass lesions identified on ultrasound (US) of the gallbladder may prompt an aggressive surgical intervention due to the possibility of a malignant neoplasm. This study aims to utilize a large modern series of patients with gallbladder lesions identified on US to evaluate imaging characteristics consistent with malignancy. A retrospective review was conducted of gallbladder ultrasound reports and clinicopathologic data of patients with a mass identified on US. Approximately 59,271 abdominal ultrasounds and 9,117 cholecystectomies were performed between February 2000 and February 2010. We identified 213 patients with a questionable gallbladder neoplasm on ultrasonography who underwent surgical exploration. Median age was 52 years (range=11-87 years) and 147 (69%) were females. Final pathology demonstrated no neoplasm in 130 patients (61%), while 32 patients (15%) had a wall adenomyoma, 36 (17%) had a polyp (five of which were malignant), 14 (7%) had an adenocarcinoma not arising from a polyp, and one patient had a cystic papillary neoplasm. The smaller the lesion, the more likely it was to be a pseudo-mass. For lesions measuring <5 mm on US, 83% had no lesion found on final pathology. Significant predictors of malignancy were age >52 years (p<0.001), presence of gallstones on US (p=0.004), size >9 mm (p<0.001), evidence of invasion at the liver interface (p<0.001), and wall thickening >5 mm (p<0.001). Shape (sessile or penduculated), echogenicity (echogenic or isoechoic), or presence of flow on Doppler were not predictors of malignancy. An US size of ≤ 9 mm had a negative predictive value of 100% for malignancy. Despite improvements in imaging, most apparent lesions measuring <5 mm on US are not identified in the surgical specimen. US size >9 mm, age >52 years, US suggestion of invasion at the liver interface, and wall thickening >5 mm, especially in the presence of gallstones, should raise the suspicion of malignancy.",Comparative Study,2981.0,21.0,"Possible mass lesions identified on ultrasound US of the may prompt an aggressive surgical intervention due to the possibility of a malignant neoplasm This study aims to utilize a large modern series of patients with lesions identified on US to evaluate imaging characteristics consistent with malignancy A retrospective review was conducted of ultrasound reports and clinicopathologic data of patients with a mass identified on US Approximately 59,271 abdominal ultrasounds and 9,117 cholecystectomies were performed between February 2000 and February 2010 We identified 213 patients with a questionable neoplasm on ultrasonography who underwent surgical exploration Median age was 52 years range=11-87 years and 147 69 were females Final pathology demonstrated no neoplasm in 130 patients 61 while 32 patients 15 had a wall adenomyoma 36 17 had a polyp five of which were malignant 14 7 had an adenocarcinoma not arising from a polyp and one patient had a cystic papillary neoplasm The smaller the lesion the more likely it was to be a pseudo-mass For lesions measuring 5 mm on US 83 had no lesion found on final pathology Significant predictors of malignancy were age 52 years p 0.001 presence of gallstones on US p=0.004 size 9 mm p 0.001 evidence of invasion at the interface p 0.001 and wall thickening 5 mm p 0.001 Shape sessile or penduculated echogenicity echogenic or isoechoic or presence of flow on Doppler were not predictors of malignancy An US size of ≤ 9 mm had a negative predictive value of 100 for malignancy Despite improvements in imaging most apparent lesions measuring 5 mm on US are not identified in the surgical specimen US size 9 mm age 52 years US suggestion of invasion at the interface and wall thickening 5 mm especially in the presence of gallstones should raise the suspicion of malignancy",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[899, 782, 406, 108, 23, 1945, 843, 1, 3, 68, 4776, 35, 571, 221, 788, 520, 6, 3, 2526, 1, 8, 393, 2131, 26, 45, 2970, 6, 6391, 8, 375, 2366, 988, 1, 7, 5, 406, 108, 23, 843, 6, 376, 270, 374, 925, 5, 710, 8, 459, 206, 10, 426, 1, 1945, 1198, 2, 1399, 74, 1, 7, 5, 8, 782, 108, 23, 843, 705, 728, 8957, 1467, 16406, 2, 83, 3843, 34686, 11, 173, 59, 3010, 1081, 2, 3010, 1120, 21, 108, 5833, 7, 5, 8, 14853, 2131, 23, 4244, 54, 208, 221, 3370, 52, 89, 10, 653, 60, 184, 175, 912, 60, 2, 4961, 790, 11, 2451, 1457, 1117, 264, 77, 2131, 4, 3431, 7, 713, 369, 531, 7, 167, 42, 8, 2397, 60811, 511, 269, 42, 8, 6493, 365, 1, 92, 11, 393, 213, 67, 42, 35, 449, 44, 2635, 29, 8, 6493, 2, 104, 69, 42, 8, 2965, 1796, 2131, 3, 2170, 3, 1180, 3, 80, 322, 192, 10, 6, 40, 8, 13337, 782, 9, 406, 2978, 33, 321, 23, 843, 852, 42, 77, 1180, 204, 23, 1457, 1117, 93, 674, 1, 710, 11, 89, 653, 60, 19, 13, 144, 463, 1, 34694, 23, 843, 19, 13, 1520, 444, 83, 321, 19, 13, 144, 241, 1, 578, 28, 3, 7074, 19, 13, 144, 2, 2397, 12085, 33, 321, 19, 13, 144, 5465, 10761, 15, 60812, 14628, 28185, 15, 22434, 15, 463, 1, 1412, 23, 10644, 11, 44, 674, 1, 710, 35, 843, 444, 1, 1552, 83, 321, 42, 8, 199, 464, 549, 1, 394, 9, 710, 550, 1474, 4, 270, 96, 2235, 406, 2978, 33, 321, 23, 843, 32, 44, 108, 4, 3, 221, 2360, 843, 444, 83, 321, 89, 653, 60, 843, 8634, 1, 578, 28, 3, 7074, 2, 2397, 12085, 33, 321, 1093, 4, 3, 463, 1, 34694, 257, 5008, 3, 5782, 1, 710]",1822.0,22108768,41
Frequent mutation of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1 and IDH2 in cholangiocarcinoma identified through broad-based tumor genotyping.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2011-12-16,"Cancers of origin in the gallbladder and bile ducts are rarely curable with current modalities of cancer treatment. Our clinical application of broad-based mutational profiling for patients diagnosed with a gastrointestinal malignancy has led to the novel discovery of mutations in the gene encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) in tumors from a subset of patients with cholangiocarcinoma. A total of 287 tumors from gastrointestinal cancer patients (biliary tract, colorectal, gastroesophageal, liver, pancreatic, and small intestine carcinoma) were tested during routine clinical evaluation for 130 site-specific mutations within 15 cancer genes. Mutations were identified within a number of genes, including KRAS (35%), TP53 (22%), PIK3CA (10%), BRAF (7%), APC (6%), NRAS (3%), AKT1 (1%), CTNNB1 (1%), and PTEN (1%). Although mutations in the metabolic enzyme IDH1 were rare in the other common gastrointestinal malignancies in this series (2%), they were found in three tumors (25%) of an initial series of 12 biliary tract carcinomas. To better define IDH1 and IDH2 mutational status, an additional 75 gallbladder and bile duct cancers were examined. Combining these cohorts of biliary cancers, mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 were found only in cholangiocarcinomas of intrahepatic origin (nine of 40, 23%) and in none of the 22 extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and none of the 25 gallbladder carcinomas.

We analyzed the patterns of treatment regarding the use of surgery for early-stage upper gastrointestinal cancer in the United States. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Research database was used to identify patients with cancer of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, liver, gallbladder, biliary tract, or duodenum (2004-2007). Only patients with potentially resectable stage I and II disease were selected. The primary outcome measure was the use of curative intent surgery. The secondary outcomes were the predictors of surgery. We identified 29,249 patients with a median age of 69 years. Only 54% of the patients underwent cancer-directed surgical resection, ranging from 28% for liver cancer to 89% for gallbladder cancer. The remaining patients underwent either local excision (8%) or no surgery (38%). Among the no surgery group, most patients (79%) were documented as ""not being recommended for resection."" The independent variables on multivariate analysis predictive of a nonoperative approach included black race, age older than 75 years, tumor size greater than 5 cm, and high poverty level (P < 0.001). Patients who did not undergo surgery had worse median and overall survival at 3 years than patients undergoing surgery (11 months versus 36 months and 14% versus 43%, respectively; P < 0.001).

ILK and PRDX1 are prognostic markers in squamous cell/adenosquamous carcinomas and adenocarcinoma of gallbladder.,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,Tumour Biol.,2012-10-13,"Although the incidence of gallbladder cancers is low, they are highly aggressive tumors. Squamous cell/adenosquamous carcinoma (SC/ASC) is a rare subtype of gallbladder cancer. The clinical characteristics of SC/ASC have not been well documented, and no prognosis marker has been identified. In this study, we examined integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and peroxiredoxin-1 (PRDX1) expression in 46 SC/ASCs and 80 adenocarcinomas (ACs) by using immunohistochemistry and analyzed their correlations with clinicopathological characteristics. We demonstrated that positive ILK and PRDX1 expressions were significantly associated with large tumor size, high TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, and invasion of SC/ASC and AC. Univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that positive ILK and PRDX1 expressions were closely associated with decreased overall survival in both SC/ASC (p < 0.001 and p = 0.005, respectively) and AC (p < 0.001) patients.

Oncol.,2012-12-01,"The variable incidence of gallbladder cancer (GBCA) suggests regional pathogenetic differences. This study compares cell cycle-regulatory, angiogenesis-related, and PI3K pathway protein expression in GBCAs from three continents. Immunohistochemical expression of several proteins was assessed, correlated with clinicopathologic variables, and compared among centers from Chile (Fundación Arturo López Pérez [FALP]), Japan (Yokohama City University [YCU]), and the United States (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center [MSKCC]). Hierarchical clustering was used to partition the data based on protein-expression and treatment center. Tissue from 117 patients (MSKCC = 76; FALP = 22; YCU = 19) was analyzed. Mdm2 overexpression was seen only at MSKCC (p < 0.0001). Absence of p21 (p = 0.03) and VEGFR2 (p = 0.018) were more common and p27 expression was less frequent (p = 0.047) in tumors from YCU. Ki-67 labeling index in YCU tumors (median = 10) was two-thirds lower than at other centers. On hierarchical clustering analysis, all YCU patients (p = 0.017) and those with early tumors (p = 0.017) clustered separately from MSKCC. Median disease-specific survival after curative intent (R0) resection was 27 months and was similar among centers (p = 0.9).

Targeted therapy of advanced gallbladder cancer and cholangiocarcinoma with aggressive biology: eliciting early response signals from phase 1 trials.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2013-01-01,"Patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma (CC) and gallbladder carcinoma (GC) have few therapeutic options for relapsed disease. methods: Given the overall poor prognosis in this population and the availability of novel targeted therapies, we systematically analyzed the characteristics and outcomes for GC and CC patients treated on phase I trials with an emphasis on targeted agents and locoregional therapies. Of 40 treated patients (GC=6; CC=34; median age, 60 years), 8 (20%) had stable disease (SD) > 6 months, 3 (8%) partial response (PR), on protocols with hepatic arterial drug infusion and anti-angiogenic, anti-HER-2/neu or novel MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors. Median progression-free survival (PFS) on phase I trials was 2.0 months (95% CI 1.7, 2.8) versus 3.0 months (95% CI 2.4, 5.0), 3.0 months (95% CI 2.3, 4.6), and 3.0 months (95% CI 2.4, 3.9) for their first-, second-, and last-line FDA-approved therapy. In univariate analysis, >3 metastatic sites, elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (>56IU/L), serum creatinine (>1.6mg/dL), and CA19-9 (>35U/mL) were associated with a shorter PFS.

J. Clin. Oncol.,2013-04-17,"The differences in clinical, pathological, and biological characteristics between adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell/adenosquamous carcinoma (SC/ASC) of gallbladder cancer have not been well documented. This study is to compare the clinicopathological characteristics and FGFBP1 and WISP-2 expression between AC and SC/ASC patients. We examined FGFBP1 and WISP-2 expression in 46 SC/ASC and 80 AC samples using immunohistochemistry and analyzed their correlations with clinicopathological characteristics. SC/ASCs occur more frequently in older patients and often correspond to larger tumor masses than ACs. Positive FGFBP1 and negative WISP-2 expression were significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and invasion of SC/ASCs and ACs. In addition, positive FGFBP1 and negative WISP-2 expression were significantly associated with differentiation and TMN stage in ACs. Univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that either elevated FGFBP1 (p < 0.001) or lowered WISP-2 (p < 0.001) expression was closely associated with decreased overall survival in both SC/ASC and AC patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that positive FGFBP1 expression (p = 0.001) or negative WISP-2 expression (p = 0.035 for SC/ASC and p = 0.009 for AC) is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in both SC/ASC and AC patients. We also revealed that differentiation, tumor size, TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, invasion, and surgical procedure were associated with survival of both SC/ASC and AC patients.

Clinicopathological features and CCT2 and PDIA2 expression in gallbladder squamous/adenosquamous carcinoma and gallbladder adenocarcinoma.,World journal of surgical oncology,World J Surg Oncol,2013-06-19,"Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a relatively uncommon carcinoma among gastrointestinal cancers and usually has a rather poor prognosis. The most common subtype of GBC is adenocarcinoma (AC), which accounts for about 90% of GBC. Squamous carcinoma/adenosquamous carcinoma (SC/ASC) are comparatively rare histopathological subtypes of GBC. The clinicopathological features and biological behaviors of SC/ASC have not been well-characterized. No molecular biomarkers are currently available for predicting the progression, metastasis, and prognosis of the SC/ASC subtype of GBC. We examined the expression levels of CCT2 and PDIA3 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining in human GBC tissue samples collected from 46 patients with SC/ASC and evaluated the clinicopathological significance of both CCT2 and PDIA3 expression in the SC/ASC subtypes of GBC by Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis. For comparison, we included specimens from 80 AC patients in our study to investigate the specificity of CCT2 and PDIA3 expression in GBC subtypes. We found that the positive expression of CCT2 and PDIA3 was significantly associated with clinicopathological features of both SC/ASC and AC specimens, including high TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. Univariate analysis revealed that the two-year survival rate was significantly lower for patients with positive expression of CCT2 and PDIA3 than for those with negative expression. Multivariate analysis also indicated that the positive expression of CCT2 and PDIA3 was negatively correlated with poor postoperative patient survival and positively correlated with high mortality.

Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we identified 5,011 patients with GBC who underwent resection between 1988 and 2009. The impact of XRT on survival was analyzed by the use of propensity-score matching by comparing clinicopathologic factors between patients who received resection only versus resection plus XRT. Median age was 72 years, and most patients were female (73.4%); 66.2% patients had intermediate to poorly differentiated tumors, and 19.1% had lymph node metastasis. The majority (75.0%) had ""localized"" disease by Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results classification. A total of 899 patients (17.9%) received XRT whereas 4,112 patients did not. Factors associated with receipt of XRT were younger age (odds ratio [OR] 5.33), tumor extension beyond the serosa (OR 1.55), intermediate- to poorly differentiated tumors (OR 1.56), and lymph node metastasis (OR 2.59) (all P < .05). Median and 1-year survival were 15 months and 59.0%, respectively.

In this study, we examined ACE2 and FZD1 expression in 46 SC/ASCs and 80 adenocarcinomas using immunohistochemistry and further analyzed their correlations with clinicopathological characteristics. We demonstrated that positive FZD1 and negative ACE2 expression were significantly associated with large tumor size, high TNM stage, lymph node metastasis and invasion of SC/ASC and AC. Univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that positive FZD1 and negative ACE2 expression as well as differentiation, tumor size, TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, invasion, and surgical curability were closely associated with decreased overall survival in both SC/ASC (p < 0.001) and AC (p < 0.001) patients. The average survival time in SC/ASC and AC patients with FZD1(-)ACE2(+) expression was significantly longer than that in patients with FZD1(+)ACE2(-) or FZD1(+)ACE2(+) (p < 0.01). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that positive FZD1 and negative ACE2 expression are independent poor-prognostic factors for both SC/ASC and AC patients. In addition, FZD1 expression positively, but ACE2 expression negatively correlated with the expression of CA19-9 in SC/ASC and AC.

Women with an intact uterus received conjugated equine estrogens (CEE; 0.625 mg/d) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 2.5 mg/d) (n = 8506) or placebo (n = 8102). Women with prior hysterectomy received CEE alone (0.625 mg/d) (n = 5310) or placebo (n = 5429). The intervention lasted a median of 5.6 years in CEE plus MPA trial and 7.2 years in CEE alone trial with 13 years of cumulative follow-up until September 30, 2010. Primary efficacy and safety outcomes were coronary heart disease (CHD) and invasive breast cancer, respectively. A global index also included stroke, pulmonary embolism, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, hip fracture, and death. During the CEE plus MPA intervention phase, the numbers of CHD cases were 196 for CEE plus MPA vs 159 for placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 1.18; 95% CI, 0.95-1.45) and 206 vs 155, respectively, for invasive breast cancer (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.01-1.53). Other risks included increased stroke, pulmonary embolism, dementia (in women aged ≥65 years), gallbladder disease, and urinary incontinence; benefits included decreased hip fractures, diabetes, and vasomotor symptoms. Most risks and benefits dissipated postintervention, although some elevation in breast cancer risk persisted during cumulative follow-up (434 cases for CEE plus MPA vs 323 for placebo; HR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.11-1.48]). The risks and benefits were more balanced during the CEE alone intervention with 204 CHD cases for CEE alone vs 222 cases for placebo (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.78-1.14) and 104 vs 135, respectively, for invasive breast cancer (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-1.02); cumulatively, there were 168 vs 216, respectively, cases of breast cancer diagnosed (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65-0.97). Results for other outcomes were similar to CEE plus MPA. Neither regimen affected all-cause mortality. For CEE alone, younger women (aged 50-59 years) had more favorable results for all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and the global index (nominal P < .05 for trend by age). Absolute risks of adverse events (measured by the global index) per 10,000 women annually taking CEE plus MPA ranged from 12 excess cases for ages of 50-59 years to 38 for ages of 70-79 years; for women taking CEE alone, from 19 fewer cases for ages of 50-59 years to 51 excess cases for ages of 70-79 years.

Gallbladder cancer-associated thrombotic microangiopathy.,"Future oncology (London, England)",Future Oncol,2013-11-01,"Cancer-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a rare but serious condition seen in patients diagnosed with malignancy. Certain tumor characteristics highlight this entity, such as large tumor burden, adenocarcinoma histology with mucinous features and bone marrow infiltration. Although these tumors may originate from any site, the majority are of stomach, breast or prostate origin. The optimal therapy is unknown but there is evidence that immediate initiation of an effective antineoplastic regimen is important. However, it is difficult to differentiate cancer-associated TMA from primary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in a timely manner. We present the first case of cancer-associated TMA in a patient secondary to a locally advanced gallbladder adenocarcinoma that lacked mucinous features and bone marrow involvement.

Prognostic significance of the highest peripancreatic lymph node in biliary tract adenocarcinoma.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2013-11-09,"Patients with biliary tract adenocarcinoma with nodal involvement have a poor prognosis. There is currently no standardized method for intraoperative lymph node assessment. The current study aimed to determine the prognostic significance of the highest peripancreatic lymph node (HPLN) in biliary tract malignancy. This was a retrospective study of patients undergoing potential curative resection of biliary tract adenocarcinoma from January 1995 through December 2010 who prospectively had intraoperative sampling of the HPLN. The median follow-up was 72.8 months. The primary end points were recurrence-free survival (RFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). The rate of HPLN positivity in 110 patients undergoing exploration for potential curative resection was 30 % and did not vary with histologic subtype (gallbladder vs. cholangiocarcinoma). Eighty-five patients underwent complete gross resection. In this subset, median RFS and DSS were 34.3 months (95 % confidence interval [CI] 23.6-not reached [NR]) and 62.4 months (95 % CI 40.8-NR) for HPLN-negative patients, and 9.6 months (95 % CI 4.76-NR) and 20.5 months (95 % CI 7.4-NR) for HPLN-positive patients (p < 0.01), respectively. Median DSS was 14.6 months (95 % CI 9.6-25.4) for patients with unresectable disease.

Molecular characterization of gallbladder cancer using somatic mutation profiling.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2013-11-12,"Gallbladder cancer is relatively uncommon, with a high incidence in certain geographic locations, including Latin America, East and South Asia, and Eastern Europe. Molecular characterization of this disease has been limited, and targeted therapy options for advanced disease remain an open area of investigation. In the present study, surgical pathology obtained from resected gallbladder cancer cases (n = 72) was examined for the presence of targetable, somatic mutations. All cases were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE). Two approaches were used: (a) mass spectroscopy-based profiling for 159 point (""hot spot"") mutations in 33 genes commonly involved in solid tumors and (b) next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform that examined the complete coding sequence of in 182 cancer-related genes. Fifty-seven cases were analyzed for hot spot mutations; and 15, for NGS. Fourteen hot spot mutations were identified in 9 cases. Of these, KRAS mutation was significantly associated with poor survival on multivariate analysis. Other targetable mutations included PIK3CA (n = 2) and ALK (n = 1). On NGS, 26 mutations were noted in 15 cases. TP53 and PI3 kinase pathway (STK11, RICTOR, TSC2) mutations were common. One case had FGF10 amplification, whereas another had FGF3-TACC gene fusion, not previously described in gallbladder cancer. In conclusion, somatic mutation profiling using archival FFPE samples from gallbladder cancer is feasible.

Twenty patients enrolled (bile duct/gallbladder cancer [14/6] and previous treatments 0/1/2 [10/6/3]). The trial was discontinued early because of lack of confirmed partial responses. No unanticipated adverse events were noted. There was 1 unconfirmed partial response. Ten patients achieved stable disease as best response.

"EphB1 and Ephrin-B, new potential biomarkers for squamous cell/adenosquamous carcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the gallbladder.",Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,Asian Pac. J. Cancer Prev.,2014-01-01,"Squamous cell/adenosquamous carcinoma (SC/ASC) of the gallbladder are rare tumors and there are few clinical reports in the literature. Herein we report our clinical experience with 46 patients with SC/ASC and 80 with adenocarcinoma (AC). Expression of EphB1 and Ephrin-B in each tumor was determined using immunohistochemical methods for determination of correlations with prognosis. There was no difference in EphB1 and Ephrin-B expression between SC/ASC and AC tumors (P>0.05), but greater expression in those less than 3 cm in diameter, stage I or II (TNM stage), with no lymph node metastases, with no local invasion and treated with radical resection was apparent. Expression of EphB1 (P<0.05) and Ephrin-B (P<0.01) was higher in well differentiated than in poorly differentiated AC tumors. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that degree of differentiation, tumor diameter, lymph node metastases, local invasion, surgical approach and expression rate of EphB1 and Ephrin-B were closely related to the survival of SC/ASC (P<0.05) and AC patients (P<0.01). Patients with tumors that positive expressed EphB1 and Ephrin-B, whether it is SC/ASC (P SC/ASC =0.000) or AC (P AC =0.000 or P AC =0.002) had longer survival than those negative expression.

An expansion cohort (Cohort III) of patients with cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder carcinoma was treated at the MTD. A standard 3 + 3 design dose escalation was used. Everolimus was given on Monday/Wednesday/Friday or daily depending upon the dose level. Gemcitabine and cisplatin were administered on days 1 and 8 of each 21 day cycle. Twelve patients were entered in Cohort I and 15 in Cohort II. The MTD for Cohort I was everolimus 5 mg on Monday/Wednesday/Friday and gemcitabine 800 mg/m(2). For Cohort II, it was everolimus 5 mg on Monday/Wednesday/Friday, gemcitabine 600 mg/m(2), and cisplatin 12.5 mg/m(2). All DLTs in this study were hematologic. Complete responses (CR) were seen in a patient with primary peritoneal carcinoma and another with recurrent pancreatic cancer. Partial responses (PR) were seen in 3 patients: breast, ampullary carcinoma and pheochromocytoma. Of 10 patients enrolled in Cohort III, six patients had stable disease and 4 had progressive disease.

Tumor location is a strong predictor of tumor progression and survival in T2 gallbladder cancer: an international multicenter study.,Annals of surgery,Ann.

However, the gallbladder has a unique anatomical relationship with the liver, and the clinical significance of tumor location remains unclear. For 437 patients with gallbladder cancer who underwent resection at 4 international institutions, clinicopathologic characteristics and their association with survival were analyzed. Tumor location was defined as ""hepatic side"" or ""peritoneal side,"" and the prognostic significance of tumor location was evaluated. Among the 252 patients with T2 disease, patients with tumors on the hepatic side (T2h, n = 99) had higher rates of vascular invasion, neural invasion, and nodal metastasis than patients with tumors on the peritoneal side (T2p, n = 153) (51% vs 19%, 33% vs 8%, and 40% vs 17%, respectively; P < 0.01 for all). After a median follow-up of 58.9 months, 3-year and 5-year survival rates were 52.1% and 42.6%, respectively, for T2h tumors and 73.7% and 64.7%, respectively, for T2p tumors (P = 0.0006).

Positron emission tomography (PET) may have a role but data are lacking. Patients with GBC and PET assessed by a hepatobiliary surgeon in clinic between January 2001 and June 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonace imaging (MRI) were correlated with PET scans and analysed for evidence of metastatic or locally unresectable disease. Medical records were reviewed to determine if PET scanning was helpful by preventing non-therapeutic surgery or enabling resection in patients initially deemed unresectable. There were 100 patients including 63 incidental GBC. Thirty-eight patients did not proceed to surgery, 35 were resected and 27 patients were explored but had unresectable disease. PET was positive for metastatic disease in 39 patients (sensitivity 56%, specificity 94%). Five patients definitively benefitted from PET: in 3 patients PET found disease not seen on CT, and 2 patients with suspicious CT findings had negative PET and successful resections. In a further 12 patients PET confirmed equivocal CT findings. Three patients had additional invasive procedures performed owing to PET avidity in other sites. Utility of PET was higher in patients with suspicious nodal disease on CT [odds ratio (OR) 7.1 versus no nodal disease, P = 0.0004], and in patients without a prior cholecystectomy (OR 3.1 versus post-cholecystectomy, P = 0.04).

Residual disease predicts outcomes after definitive resection for incidental gallbladder cancer.,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,J. Am. Coll. Surg.,2014-05-16,"Residual disease (RD) at definitive resection of incidental gallbladder cancer (IGBCA) influences outcome, but its clinical relevance with respect to anatomic site is incompletely characterized. Consecutive patients with IGBCA undergoing re-exploration from 1998 to 2009 were identified; those submitted to a complete resection were analyzed. Demographics and tumor- and treatment-related variables were correlated with RD and survival. Cancer-specific survival was stratified by site of RD (local [gallbladder bed]; regional [bile duct, lymph nodes]; distant [discontiguous liver, port site, peritoneal]). Of the 135 patients submitted to re-exploration, RD was found in 82 (61%) overall and in 63 (54%) of 116 patients submitted to resection; the most common site was regional (n = 27, 43%).

Between 2004 and 2010, 1,124 patients with GBA were identified from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. The discriminative ability of each LN staging/scoring system was assessed using the Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and the Harrell's concordance index. When assessed using categorical values, LNR had a modest, improved ability to discriminate patients with regard to prognosis (C-index: 0.615; AIC: 2118.2) compared with AJCC/UICC N stage or N score and a prognostic discrimination comparable to LODDS. Among patients who had a total number of LN examined (TNLE) of 1 or 2, all the staging/scoring systems performed comparably.

Risk factors for the development of uterine cancer in breast cancer survivors: an army of women study.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2014-11-01,"Our study compares breast cancer survivors without a secondary diagnosis of uterine cancer (BC) to breast cancer survivors with a diagnosis of uterine cancer (BUC) to determine clinical characteristics that increase the odds of developing uterine cancer. A total of 7,228 breast cancer survivors were surveyed. A case-control study was performed with 173 BUC patients matched by age and race in a 1:5 ratio to 865 BC patients. Multivariable logistic regression examined which factors influence the odds of developing uterine cancer. A total of 5,980 (82.3 %) women did not have a previous hysterectomy at the time of breast cancer diagnosis, of which 173 (2.9 %) subsequently developed uterine cancer. There was no significant difference in body mass index (BMI) (34.4 vs. 34.1, p = 0.388) or age (52.3 vs. 52.3 years, p = 0.999) between the two groups. Increased odds for developing uterine cancer were found in patients with a personal history of hypertension [odds ratio (OR) = 1.62, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.45-2.70, p < 0.001], gallbladder disease (OR = 1.30, 95 % CI 1.14-1.55, p = 0.005), and thyroid disease (OR = 1.55, 95 % CI 1.37-1.69, p < 0.001).

"Expression, Clinical Significance, and Receptor Identification of the Newest B7 Family Member HHLA2 Protein.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2014-12-30,"HHLA2 (B7H7/B7-H5/B7y) is a newly identified B7 family member that regulates human T-cell functions. However, its protein expression in human organs and significance in human diseases are unknown. The objective of this study was to analyze HHLA2 protein expression in normal human tissues and cancers, as well as its prognostic significance, to explore mechanisms regulating HHLA2 expression, and to identify candidate HHLA2 receptors. An immunohistochemistry protocol and a flow cytometry assay with newly generated monoclonal antibodies were developed to examine HHLA2 protein. HHLA2 gene copy-number variation was analyzed from cancer genomic data. The combination of bioinformatics analysis and immunologic approaches was established to explore HHLA2 receptors. HHLA2 protein was detected in trophoblastic cells of the placenta and the epithelium of gut, kidney, gallbladder, and breast, but not in most other organs. In contrast, HHLA2 protein was widely expressed in human cancers from the breast, lung, thyroid, melanoma, pancreas, ovary, liver, bladder, colon, prostate, kidney, and esophagus. In a cohort of 50 patients with stage I-III triple-negative breast cancer, 56% of patients had aberrant expression of HHLA2 on their tumors, and high HHLA2 expression was significantly associated with regional lymph node metastasis and stage. The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that HHLA2 copy-number gains were present in 29% of basal breast cancers, providing a potential mechanism for increased HHLA2 protein expression in breast cancer. Finally, Transmembrane and Immunoglobulin Domain Containing 2 (TMIGD2) was identified as one of the receptors for HHLA2. Wide expression of HHLA2 in human malignancies, together with its association with poor prognostic factors and its T-cell coinhibitory capability, suggests that the HHLA2 pathway represents a novel immunosuppressive mechanism within the tumor microenvironment and an attractive target for human cancer therapy.",Journal Article,1848.0,43.0,HHLA2 B7H7/B7-H5/B7y is a newly identified B7 family member that regulates human T-cell functions However its protein expression in human organs and significance in human diseases are unknown The objective of this study was to analyze HHLA2 protein expression in normal human tissues and cancers as well as its prognostic significance to explore mechanisms regulating HHLA2 expression and to identify candidate HHLA2 receptors An immunohistochemistry protocol and a flow cytometry assay with newly generated monoclonal antibodies were developed to examine HHLA2 protein HHLA2 gene copy-number variation was analyzed from cancer genomic data The combination of bioinformatics analysis and immunologic approaches was established to explore HHLA2 receptors HHLA2 protein was detected in trophoblastic cells of the placenta and the epithelium of gut and but not in most other organs In contrast HHLA2 protein was widely expressed in human cancers from the ovary and In a cohort of 50 patients with stage I-III triple-negative cancer 56 of patients had aberrant expression of HHLA2 on their tumors and high HHLA2 expression was significantly associated with regional lymph node metastasis and stage The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that HHLA2 copy-number gains were present in 29 of basal cancers providing a potential mechanism for increased HHLA2 protein expression in cancer Finally Transmembrane and Immunoglobulin Domain Containing 2 TMIGD2 was identified as one of the receptors for HHLA2 Wide expression of HHLA2 in human malignancies together with its association with poor prognostic factors and its T-cell coinhibitory capability suggests that the HHLA2 pathway represents a novel immunosuppressive mechanism within the tumor microenvironment and an attractive target for human cancer therapy,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,"[11888, 65403, 3181, 19811, 65404, 16, 8, 732, 108, 3181, 607, 2693, 17, 2468, 171, 102, 31, 1681, 137, 211, 178, 55, 4, 171, 2285, 2, 724, 4, 171, 1342, 32, 860, 3, 461, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 1992, 11888, 178, 55, 4, 295, 171, 742, 2, 163, 22, 149, 22, 211, 177, 724, 6, 1645, 483, 2681, 11888, 55, 2, 6, 255, 1609, 11888, 1186, 35, 888, 1182, 2, 8, 1412, 1914, 719, 5, 732, 1419, 848, 890, 11, 276, 6, 1004, 11888, 178, 11888, 145, 1337, 207, 1380, 10, 311, 29, 12, 572, 74, 3, 150, 1, 6579, 65, 2, 3042, 611, 10, 635, 6, 1645, 11888, 1186, 11888, 178, 10, 530, 4, 11355, 37, 1, 3, 19600, 2, 3, 2781, 1, 7600, 2, 84, 44, 4, 96, 127, 2285, 4, 748, 11888, 178, 10, 1792, 570, 4, 171, 163, 29, 3, 3631, 2, 4, 8, 180, 1, 212, 7, 5, 82, 70, 316, 1500, 199, 12, 664, 1, 7, 42, 1898, 55, 1, 11888, 23, 136, 57, 2, 64, 11888, 55, 10, 97, 41, 5, 951, 263, 289, 278, 2, 82, 3, 12, 898, 2643, 553, 17, 11888, 1337, 207, 3849, 11, 364, 4, 462, 1, 2135, 163, 1736, 8, 174, 670, 9, 101, 11888, 178, 55, 4, 12, 1368, 5527, 2, 2593, 1398, 1101, 18, 48770, 10, 108, 22, 104, 1, 3, 1186, 9, 11888, 1019, 55, 1, 11888, 4, 171, 441, 1162, 5, 211, 248, 5, 334, 177, 130, 2, 211, 102, 31, 10928, 6188, 844, 17, 3, 11888, 308, 1449, 8, 229, 2989, 670, 262, 3, 30, 995, 2, 35, 3059, 283, 9, 171, 12, 36]",1797.0,25549724,26
Microsatellite instability in gallbladder carcinoma.,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,Virchows Arch.,2015-02-14,"The genetic abnormalities involved in the pathogenesis of gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) remain unclear. Microsatellite instability (MSI) has been described in many carcinomas, but little is known about the significance of mismatch repair in gallbladder carcinogenesis. Additionally, methylation status of long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1), a surrogate marker of global DNA methylation, has defined distinct subsets of other cancer types but has not been explored in GBC. Immunohistochemical expression of MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2 and LINE-1 mRNA in situ hybridization was evaluated in 67 primary and 15 metastatic GBCs from 77 patients. Amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) was evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Genotyping for 24 genes involved in carcinogenesis was performed using a multiplex PCR-based platform. MSI was present in 6 of 77 GBCs (7.8 %). Loss of MSH2/MSH6 was detected in five cases and loss of MLH1/PMS2 in one case. MSI status was not associated with Lynch syndrome, tumor grade, extracellular mucin, or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. There was no significant difference in mean overall survival of patients with and without MSI. Strong LINE-1 staining was identified in none of the GBC with MSI and in 36 of 69 (52 %) of those without MSI (p = 0.005), suggesting that LINE-1 in the former cohort was hypermethylated. All MSI tumors were negative for HER2 amplification, and TP53 and NRAS mutations were only found in GBC without MSI. MSI was identified in a minority of GBC cases. The strong correlation between global DNA methylation as measured by LINE-1 and loss of mismatch repair proteins suggests that methylation may account for the loss of these proteins. These hypermethylated tumors appear to represent a genetically unique cohort of gallbladder neoplasms, and the data suggests that demethylating agents may have a therapeutic value in this class of tumors.",Journal Article,1802.0,16.0,The genetic abnormalities involved in the pathogenesis of carcinoma GBC remain unclear Microsatellite instability MSI has been described in many carcinomas but little is known about the significance of mismatch repair in carcinogenesis Additionally methylation status of long interspersed element-1 LINE-1 a surrogate marker of global DNA methylation has defined distinct subsets of other cancer types but has not been explored in GBC Immunohistochemical expression of MSH2 MSH6 MLH1 and PMS2 and LINE-1 mRNA in situ hybridization was evaluated in 67 primary and 15 metastatic GBCs from 77 patients Amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 HER2 was evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization Genotyping for 24 genes involved in carcinogenesis was performed using a multiplex PCR-based platform MSI was present in 6 of 77 GBCs 7.8 Loss of MSH2/MSH6 was detected in five cases and loss of MLH1/PMS2 in one case MSI status was not associated with Lynch syndrome tumor grade extracellular mucin or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes There was no significant difference in mean overall survival of patients with and without MSI Strong LINE-1 staining was identified in none of the GBC with MSI and in 36 of 69 52 of those without MSI p 0.005 suggesting that LINE-1 in the former cohort was hypermethylated All MSI tumors were negative for HER2 amplification and TP53 and NRAS mutations were only found in GBC without MSI MSI was identified in a minority of GBC cases The strong correlation between global DNA methylation as measured by LINE-1 and loss of mismatch repair proteins suggests that methylation may account for the loss of these proteins These hypermethylated tumors appear to represent a genetically unique cohort of neoplasms and the data suggests that demethylating agents may have a therapeutic value in this class of tumors,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 336, 1171, 646, 4, 3, 1384, 1, 134, 6344, 918, 1200, 2226, 1753, 1494, 71, 85, 1027, 4, 445, 826, 84, 1215, 16, 440, 545, 3, 724, 1, 2617, 972, 4, 1719, 1724, 569, 156, 1, 319, 11038, 4467, 14, 328, 14, 8, 2592, 952, 1, 1648, 261, 569, 71, 395, 834, 1890, 1, 127, 12, 630, 84, 71, 44, 85, 1443, 4, 6344, 1382, 55, 1, 4272, 5176, 3321, 2, 7300, 2, 328, 14, 956, 4, 957, 1554, 10, 194, 4, 598, 86, 2, 167, 113, 22814, 29, 849, 7, 1073, 1, 171, 829, 129, 161, 153, 18, 354, 10, 194, 20, 1591, 4, 957, 1554, 2686, 9, 259, 214, 646, 4, 1719, 10, 173, 75, 8, 4908, 604, 90, 2243, 1494, 10, 364, 4, 49, 1, 849, 22814, 67, 66, 407, 1, 4272, 5176, 10, 530, 4, 365, 140, 2, 407, 1, 3321, 7300, 4, 104, 473, 1494, 156, 10, 44, 41, 5, 3546, 681, 30, 88, 1976, 5258, 15, 30, 2097, 1594, 125, 10, 77, 93, 523, 4, 313, 63, 25, 1, 7, 5, 2, 187, 1494, 1082, 328, 14, 1029, 10, 108, 4, 1292, 1, 3, 6344, 5, 1494, 2, 4, 511, 1, 790, 653, 1, 135, 187, 1494, 19, 13, 1614, 802, 17, 328, 14, 4, 3, 3623, 180, 10, 6936, 62, 1494, 57, 11, 199, 9, 354, 1073, 2, 1206, 2, 2845, 138, 11, 158, 204, 4, 6344, 187, 1494, 1494, 10, 108, 4, 8, 2652, 1, 6344, 140, 3, 1082, 816, 59, 1648, 261, 569, 22, 644, 20, 328, 14, 2, 407, 1, 2617, 972, 652, 844, 17, 569, 68, 1967, 9, 3, 407, 1, 46, 652, 46, 6936, 57, 1322, 6, 1231, 8, 2301, 991, 180, 1, 1179, 2, 3, 74, 844, 17, 8399, 183, 68, 47, 8, 189, 549, 4, 26, 1040, 1, 57]",1852.0,25680569,21

SWOG S0809: A Phase II Intergroup Trial of Adjuvant Capecitabine and Gemcitabine Followed by Radiotherapy and Concurrent Capecitabine in Extrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma and Gallbladder Carcinoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2015-05-11,"The role of postoperative therapy in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EHCC) or gallbladder carcinoma (GBCA) is unknown. S0809 was designed to estimate 2-year survival (overall and after R0 or R1 resection), pattern of relapse, and toxicity in patients treated with this adjuvant regimen. Eligibility criteria included diagnosis of EHCC or GBCA after radical resection, stage pT2-4 or N+ or positive resection margins, M0, and performance status 0 to 1. Patients received four cycles of gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 and 8) and capecitabine (1,500 mg/m(2) per day on days 1 to 14) every 21 days followed by concurrent capecitabine (1,330 mg/m(2) per day) and radiotherapy (45 Gy to regional lymphatics; 54 to 59.4 Gy to tumor bed). With 80 evaluable patients, results would be promising if 2-year survival 95% CI were > 45% and R0 and R1 survival estimates were ≥ 65% and 45%, respectively. A total of 79 eligible patients (R0, n = 54; R1, n = 25; EHCC, 68%; GBCA, 32%) were treated (86% completed). For all patients, 2-year survival was 65% (95% CI, 53% to 74%); it was 67% and 60% in R0 and R1 patients, respectively. Median overall survival was 35 months (R0, 34 months; R1, 35 months). Local, distant, and combined relapse occurred in 14, 24, and nine patients. Grade 3 and 4 adverse effects were observed in 52% and 11% of patients, respectively.

HER2/neu-directed therapy for biliary tract cancer.,Journal of hematology & oncology,J Hematol Oncol,2015-05-29,"Biliary cancers are highly aggressive tumors that are often diagnosed an advanced disease stage and have a poor outcome with systemic therapy. Recent efforts towards molecular characterization have identified a subset of biliary patients that have HER2/neu amplification or mutation. HER2/neu amplification is associated with response to HER2/neu-directed therapy in breast and gastric cancers. However, the efficacy of HER2/neu-targeted therapy in biliary cancers is unknown. We retrospectively reviewed cases of advanced gallbladder cancer and cholangiocarcinoma with HER2/neu genetic aberrations or protein overexpression who received HER2/neu-directed therapy between 2007 and 2014. Clinical data were retrieved from medical records, and imaging studies were independently reviewed. Nine patients with gallbladder cancer and five patients with cholangiocarcinoma had received HER2/neu-directed therapy (trastuzumab, lapatinib, or pertuzumab) during the study period. In the gallbladder cancer group, HER2/neu gene amplification or overexpression was detected in eight cases. These patients experienced disease stability (n = 3), partial response (n = 4), or complete response (n = 1) with HER2/neu-directed therapy. One patient had HER2/neu mutation and experienced a mixed response after lapatinib therapy. The duration of response varied from 8+ to 168 weeks (median 40 weeks), and three patients are still on therapy. One patient developed HER2/neu amplification as a secondary event after FGFR-directed therapy for FGF3-TACC3 gene fusion. The cholangiocarcinoma cases treated in this series had a higher proportion of HER2/neu mutations, and no radiological responses were seen in these patients despite HER2/neu-directed therapy.

Molecular Targets in Biliary Carcinogenesis and Implications for Therapy.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2015-05-29,"Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) encompass a group of invasive carcinomas, including cholangiocarcinoma (intrahepatic, perihilar, or extrahepatic), and gallbladder carcinoma. Approximately 90% of patients present with advanced, unresectable disease and have a poor prognosis. The latest recommendation is to treat advanced or metastatic disease with gemcitabine and cisplatin, although chemotherapy has recorded modest survival benefits. Comprehension of the molecular basis of biliary carcinogenesis has resulted in experimental trials of targeted therapies in BTCs, with promising results. This review addresses the emerging role of targeted therapy in the treatment of BTCs. Findings from preclinical studies were reviewed and correlated with the outcomes of clinical trials that were undertaken to translate the laboratory discoveries. Biliary tract cancers are rare. Approximately 90% of patients present with advanced, unresectable disease and have a poor prognosis. Median overall and progression-free survival are 12 and 8 months, respectively.

In summary, within high incidence areas, the assessment of routine gallbladder specimens should include the microscopic evaluation of a minimum of three sections and the cystic duct margin; specimens with dysplasia or proven cancer should be extensively sampled. Provided the patient is medically fit for surgery, data support the resection of all gallbladder polyps of >1.0 cm in diameter and those with imaging evidence of vascular stalks. The minimum staging evaluation of patients with suspected or proven gallbladder cancer includes contrasted cross-sectional imaging and diagnostic laparoscopy. Adequate lymphadenectomy includes assessment of any suspicious regional nodes, evaluation of the aortocaval nodal basin, and a goal recovery of at least six nodes. Patients with confirmed metastases to N2 nodal stations do not benefit from radical resection and should receive systemic and/or palliative treatments. Primary resection of patients with early T-stage (T1b-2) disease should include en bloc resection of adjacent liver parenchyma. Patients with T1b, T2 or T3 disease that is incidentally identified in a cholecystectomy specimen should undergo re-resection unless this is contraindicated by advanced disease or poor performance status. Re-resection should include complete portal lymphadenectomy and bile duct resection only when needed to achieve a negative margin (R0) resection. Patients with preoperatively staged T3 or T4 N1 disease should be considered for clinical trials of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Evaluation of Adjuvant Radiation Therapy for Resected Gallbladder Carcinoma: A Multi-institutional Experience.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2015-07-30,"The role of adjuvant radiation for gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is uncertain. We combine the experience of six National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers to explore the impact of adjuvant radiation following oncologic resection of GBC. Patients who underwent extended surgery for GBC at Johns Hopkins, Mayo Clinic, Duke University, Oregon Health & Science University, University of Michigan, and University of Texas MD Anderson between 1985 and 2008 were reviewed. Patients with metastatic disease at surgery, gross residual disease, or missing pathologic information were excluded. Of the 112 patients identified, 61 % received adjuvant radiation, 93 % of whom received concurrent chemotherapy. Median follow-up of surviving patients was 47.3 (range 2.2-167.7) months. Patients who received adjuvant radiation had a higher rate of advanced T-stage (57 vs. 16 %, p < 0.01), lymph node involvement (63 vs. 18 %, p < 0.01), and positive microscopic margins (37 vs. 9 %, p < 0.01) compared with patients managed with surgery alone, but overall survival (OS) was comparable between the two cohorts (5-year OS: 49.7 vs. 52.5 %, p = 0.20). Lymph node involvement had the strongest association with poor OS (p < 0.01). Adjuvant radiation was associated with decreased isolated local failure (hazard ratio 0.17, 95 % confidence interval 0.05-0.63, p = 0.01). However, 71 % of recurrences included distant failure. Following oncologic resection for GBC, adjuvant radiation may offer improved local control compared with observation. The benefit of adjuvant radiation beyond chemotherapy alone should therefore be explored. Certainly, the high rate of distant failure highlights the need for more effective systemic therapy.",Evaluation Study,1636.0,13.0,The role of adjuvant radiation for carcinoma GBC is uncertain We combine the experience of six National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers to explore the impact of adjuvant radiation following oncologic resection of GBC Patients who underwent extended surgery for GBC at Johns Hopkins Mayo Clinic Duke University Oregon Health Science University University of Michigan and University of Texas MD Anderson between 1985 and 2008 were reviewed Patients with metastatic disease at surgery gross residual disease or missing pathologic information were excluded Of the 112 patients identified 61 received adjuvant radiation 93 of whom received concurrent chemotherapy Median follow-up of surviving patients was 47.3 range 2.2-167.7 months Patients who received adjuvant radiation had a higher rate of advanced T-stage 57 vs. 16 p 0.01 lymph node involvement 63 vs. 18 p 0.01 and positive microscopic margins 37 vs. 9 p 0.01 compared with patients managed with surgery alone but overall survival OS was comparable between the two cohorts 5-year OS 49.7 vs. 52.5 p 0.20 Lymph node involvement had the strongest association with poor OS p 0.01 Adjuvant radiation was associated with decreased isolated local failure hazard ratio 0.17 95 confidence interval 0.05-0.63 p 0.01 However 71 of recurrences included distant failure Following oncologic resection for GBC adjuvant radiation may offer improved local control compared with observation The benefit of adjuvant radiation beyond chemotherapy alone should therefore be explored Certainly the high rate of distant failure highlights the need for more effective systemic therapy,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 200, 1, 249, 121, 9, 134, 6344, 16, 2717, 21, 4680, 3, 730, 1, 437, 657, 12, 1377, 4107, 12, 1168, 6, 1645, 3, 345, 1, 249, 121, 366, 1998, 170, 1, 6344, 7, 54, 208, 1747, 152, 9, 6344, 28, 5848, 5569, 2486, 1188, 11543, 1652, 23286, 341, 3797, 1652, 1652, 1, 9432, 2, 1652, 1, 2738, 2244, 1929, 59, 4675, 2, 1375, 11, 446, 7, 5, 113, 34, 28, 152, 1789, 753, 34, 15, 4593, 510, 487, 11, 1800, 1, 3, 3726, 7, 108, 713, 103, 249, 121, 966, 1, 953, 103, 750, 56, 52, 166, 126, 1, 3050, 7, 10, 662, 27, 184, 18, 18, 5431, 67, 53, 7, 54, 103, 249, 121, 42, 8, 142, 116, 1, 131, 102, 82, 696, 105, 245, 19, 13, 355, 263, 289, 799, 676, 105, 203, 19, 13, 355, 2, 109, 2984, 1012, 567, 105, 83, 19, 13, 355, 72, 5, 7, 2231, 5, 152, 279, 84, 63, 25, 118, 10, 1279, 59, 3, 100, 736, 33, 111, 118, 739, 67, 105, 653, 33, 19, 13, 179, 263, 289, 799, 42, 3, 3311, 248, 5, 334, 118, 19, 13, 355, 249, 121, 10, 41, 5, 340, 1355, 293, 496, 360, 197, 13, 269, 48, 307, 268, 13, 474, 13, 676, 19, 13, 355, 137, 792, 1, 1593, 159, 626, 496, 366, 1998, 170, 9, 6344, 249, 121, 68, 1918, 231, 293, 182, 72, 5, 1664, 3, 247, 1, 249, 121, 1654, 56, 279, 257, 673, 40, 1443, 13486, 3, 64, 116, 1, 626, 496, 2527, 3, 594, 9, 80, 323, 403, 36]",1627.0,26224402,8
Initial Misdiagnosis of Proximal Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Is Associated with Delay in Diagnosis and Advanced Stage at Presentation.,Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,J. Gastrointest. Surg.,2015-08-19,"Delay in diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with decreased survival. The effect of an initial misdiagnosis on delay in diagnosis and stage of PDAC is unknown. This study is a retrospective review (2000-2010) from a University-based cancer center of new diagnoses of proximal PDAC. Of 313 patients, 98 (31.3 %) had an initial misdiagnosis. Misdiagnosed patients were younger, 62.8 ± 12.6 vs. 68.0 ± 10.1 (p < 0.001). The most common initial misdiagnoses were: gallbladder disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and peptic ulcer disease. After excluding patients with prior cholecystectomy, 14.2 % were misdiagnosed with gallbladder disease and underwent cholecystectomy before PDAC diagnosis. Misdiagnosed patients had higher rates of abdominal pain (p < 0.001), weight loss (p = 0.04), and acute pancreatitis (p < 0.001) and lower rate of jaundice (p < 0.001). Median time between symptoms to PDAC diagnosis was longer in misdiagnosed: 4.2 months vs. 1.4 (p < 0.001). Median time from contact with medical provider to axial imaging was longer in misdiagnosed (p < 0.001). Rate of stages III-IV disease at diagnosis was higher in misdiagnosed: 61.2 vs. 43.7 % (p = 0.004), with a 1.4 (95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.12-1.74) higher risk of stages III-IV disease at diagnosis; however, there was no difference in median overall survival in misdiagnosed patients (9.6 months in misdiagnosed vs. 10.3 months in correctly diagnosed, p = 0.69).

Prognostic Implications of Lymph Node Status for Patients With Gallbladder Cancer: A Multi-Institutional Study.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2016-05-05,"Although the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification is the most accepted lymph node (LN) staging system for gallbladder adenocarcinoma (GBA), other LN prognostic schemes have been proposed. This study sought to define the performance of the AJCC LN staging system relative to the number of metastatic LNs (NMLN), the log odds of metastatic LN (LODDS), and the LN ratio (LNR). Patients who underwent curative-intent resection for GBA between 2000 and 2015 were identified from a multi-institutional database. The prognostic performance of various LN staging systems was compared by Harrell's C and the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Altogether, 214 patients with a median age of 66.7 years (interquartile range [IQR] 56.5-73.1) were identified. A total of 1334 LNs were retrieved, with a median of 4 (IQR 2-8) LNs per patient. Patients with LN metastasis had an increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 1.87; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.24-2.82; P = 0.003) and recurrence (HR 2.28; 95 % CI 1.37-3.80; P = 0.002). In the entire cohort, LNR, analyzed as either a continuous scale (C-index, 0.603; AIC, 803.5) or a discrete scale (C-index, 0.609; AIC, 802.2), provided better prognostic discrimination.

Impact of Chemotherapy and External-Beam Radiation Therapy on Outcomes among Patients with Resected Gallbladder Cancer: A Multi-institutional Analysis.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2016-05-11,"Use of adjuvant chemotherapy (CTx) and chemoradiation therapy (cXRT) for the treatment of gallbladder cancer (GBC) remains varied. We sought to define the utilization and effect of adjuvant therapy for patients with GBC. Using a multi-institutional national database, 291 patients with GBC who underwent curative-intent resection between 2000 and 2015 were included. Patients with metastasis or an R2 margin were excluded. Median patient age was 66.6 years. Most patients had a T2 (46.2 %) or T3 (38.6 %) lesion, and 37.8 % of patients had lymph node (LN) metastasis. A total of 186 (63.9 %) patients underwent surgery alone, 61 (21.0 %) received CTx, and 44 (15.1 %) patients received cXRT. On multivariable analysis, factors associated with worse overall survival (OS) included T3/T4 stage [hazard ratio (HR) 1.82], LN-metastasis (HR 1.84), lymphovascular invasion (HR 2.02), perineural invasion (HR 1.42), and R1 surgical margin status (HR 2.06); all P < 0.05). In contrast, receipt of CTx/cXRT was associated with improved OS (CTx, HR 0.38; cXRT, HR 0.26; P < 0.001) compared with surgery alone.

Association of Physical Activity by Type and Intensity With Digestive System Cancer Risk.,JAMA oncology,JAMA Oncol,2016-09-01,"Accumulating evidence indicates that common carcinogenic pathways may underlie digestive system cancers. Physical activity may influence these pathways. Yet, to our knowledge, no previous study has evaluated the role of physical activity in overall digestive system cancer risk. To examine the association between physical activity and digestive system cancer risk, accounting for amount, type (aerobic vs resistance), and intensity of physical activity. A prospective cohort study followed 43 479 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study from 1986 to 2012. At enrollment, the eligible participants were 40 years or older, were free of cancer, and reported physical activity. Follow-up rates exceeded 90% in each 2-year cycle. The amount of total physical activity expressed in metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-hours/week. Incident cancer of the digestive system encompassing the digestive tract (mouth, throat, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and colorectum) and digestive accessory organs (pancreas, gallbladder, and liver). Over 686 924 person-years, we documented 1370 incident digestive system cancers. Higher levels of physical activity were associated with lower digestive system cancer risk (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74 for ≥63.0 vs ≤8.9 MET-hours/week; 95% CI, 0.59-0.93; P value for trend = .003). The inverse association was more evident with digestive tract cancers (HR, 0.66 for ≥63.0 vs ≤8.9 MET-hours/week; 95% CI, 0.51-0.87) than with digestive accessary organ cancers. Aerobic exercise was particularly beneficial against digestive system cancers, with the optimal benefit observed at approximately 30 MET-hours/week (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.56-0.83; P value for nonlinearity = .02). Moreover, as long as the same level of MET-hour score was achieved from aerobic exercise, the magnitude of risk reduction was similar regardless of intensity of aerobic exercise. Physical activity, as indicated by MET-hours/week, was inversely associated with the risk of digestive system cancers, particularly digestive tract cancers, in men. The optimal benefit was observed through aerobic exercise of any intensity at the equivalent of energy expenditure of approximately 10 hours/week of walking at average pace.

Assessing the impact of common bile duct resection in the surgical management of gallbladder cancer.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2016-05-20,"Although radical re-resection for gallbladder cancer (GBC) has been advocated, the optimal extent of re-resection remains unknown. The current study aimed to assess the impact of common bile duct (CBD) resection on survival among patients undergoing surgery for GBC. Patients undergoing curative-intent surgery for GBC were identified using a multi-institutional cohort of patients. Multivariable Cox-proportional hazards regression was performed to identify risk factors for a poor overall survival (OS). Among the 449 patients identified, 26.9% underwent a concomitant CBD resection. The median number of lymph nodes harvested did not differ based on CBD resection (CBD, 4 [IQR: 2-9] vs. no CBD, 3 [IQR: 1-7], P = 0.108). While patients who underwent a CBD resection had a worse OS, after adjusting for potential confounders, CBD resection did not impact OS (HR = 1.40, 95%CI 0.87-2.27, P = 0.170). Rather, the presence of advanced disease (T3: HR = 3.11, 95%CI 1.22-7.96, P = 0.018; T4: HR = 7.24, 95%CI 1.70-30.85, P = 0.007) and the presence of disease at the surgical margin (HR = 2.58, 95%CI 1.26-5.31, P = 0.010) were predictive of a worse OS.

Changing Odds of Survival Over Time among Patients Undergoing Surgical Resection of Gallbladder Carcinoma.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2016-08-05,"While survival after malignancies is traditionally reported as actuarial survival, conditional survival (CS) may be more clinically relevant by accounting for ""accrued"" survival time as time progresses. We sought to compare actuarial and CS among patients with gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) . A total of 312 patients who underwent curative intent surgery for GBC between 2000 and 2014 were identified using a multi-institutional database. Overall survival (OS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. CS was calculated as the probability of surviving an additional 3 years at year ""x"" after surgery using the formula CS<sub>3</sub> = S<sub>(x+3)</sub>/S<sub>x</sub>. Among all patients, the median actuarial OS was 24.8 months (IQR 13.3-88.9). While actuarial survival decreased over time, 3-year CS (CS<sub>3</sub>) increased, with CS<sub>3</sub> at 2 years after surgery noted to be 61.8 % compared with the 5-year actuarial OS of 31.6 %. Factors associated with reduced actuarial OS were positive margin status (HR 3.61, 95 % CI 2.47-5.26), increasing tumor size (HR = 1.02, 95 % CI 1.01-1.02), higher tumor grade (HR 2.98, 95 % CI 1.47-6.04), residual disease at repeat resection (HR = 2.78, 95 % CI 1.49-3.49, p < 0.001), and lymph node metastasis (HR = 1.95, 95 % CI 1.39-2.75, all p < 0.001). The calculated CS<sub>3</sub> exceeded the actuarial survival within each high-risk patient subgroup. For example, patients with residual disease at repeat resection had an actuarial survival 23.1 % at 5 years versus a CS<sub>3</sub> of 56.3 % in patients alive at 2 years (Δ = 33.2 %).

The current study aimed to define the incidence and patterns of recurrence following gallbladder cancer resection. Using a multi-institutional cohort we identified 217 patient undergoing curative intent surgery for gallbladder cancer. Patterns of recurrence were classified as locoregional and distant recurrence. At last follow-up, 76 patients (35.0%) had experienced a recurrence (locoregional only, n = 12, 15.8%; distant only, n = 50, 65.8%; locoregional and distant, n = 14, 18.4%). Median time to recurrence was 9.5 months (IQR 4.7-17.6) and was not associated with recurrence site (all p > 0.05).

Defining the Chance of Statistical Cure Among Patients with Extrahepatic Biliary Tract Cancer.,World journal of surgery,World J Surg,2017-01-01,"While surgery offers the best curative-intent treatment, many patients with biliary tract malignancies have poor long-term outcomes. We sought to apply a non-mixture cure model to calculate the cure fraction and the time to cure after surgery of patients with peri-hilar cholangiocarcinoma (PHCC) or gallbladder cancer (GBC). Using the Extrahepatic Biliary Malignancy Consortium, 576 patients who underwent curative-intent surgery for gallbladder carcinoma or peri-hilar cholangiocarcinoma between 1998 and 2014 at 10 major hepatobiliary institutions were identified and included in the analysis. A non-mixture cure model was adopted to compare mortality after surgery to the mortality expected for the general population matched by sex and age. The median and 5-year overall survival (OS) were 1.9 years (IQR, 0.9-4.9) and 23.9 % (95 % CI, 19.6-28.6). Among all patients with PHCC or GBC, the probability of being cured after surgery was 14.5 % (95 % CI, 8.7-23.2); the time to cure was 9.7 years and the median survival of uncured patients was 1.8 years. Determinants of cure probabilities included lymph node metastasis and CA 19.9 level (p ≤ 0.05). The cure fraction for patients with a CA 19.9 < 50 U/ml and no lymph nodes metastases were 39.0 % versus only 5.1 % among patients with a CA 19.9 ≥ 50 who also had lymph node metastasis.

Biliary cancer: Utility of next-generation sequencing for clinical management.,Cancer,Cancer,2016-09-13,"Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) typically present at an advanced stage, and systemic chemotherapy is often of limited benefit. Hybrid capture-based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) was performed for 412 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (IHCCAs), 57 extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (EHCCAs), and 85 gallbladder carcinomas (GBCAs). The mutational profile was correlated with the clinical outcome of standard and experimental therapies for 321 patients. Clinical variables, detected mutations, and administered therapies were correlated with overall survival (OS) in a Cox regression model. The most frequent genetic aberrations (GAs) observed were tumor protein 53 (TP53; 27%), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B (CDKN2A/B; 27%), KRAS (22%), AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A; 18%), and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1; 16%) in IHCCA; KRAS (42%), TP53 (40%), CDKN2A/B (17%), and SMAD4 (21%) in EHCCA; and TP53 (59%), CDKN2A/B (19%), ARID1A (13%), and ERBB2 (16%) in GBCA. Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR; 11%) and IDH mutations (20%) were mostly limited to IHCCA but appeared to be mutually exclusive. In the IHCCA group, TP53 and KRAS mutations were associated significantly with poor OS, whereas FGFR2 mutations were associated with improved OS (P = .001), a younger age at onset, and female sex. IDH1/2 mutations were not prognostic. In a multivariate model, the effects of TP53 and FGFR GAs remained significant (P < .05). Patients with FGFR GAs had superior OS with FGFR-targeted therapy versus standard regimens (P = .006). Targeted therapy in IHCCA was associated with a numerical OS improvement (P = .07). This is the largest clinically annotated data set of BTC cases with CGP and indicates the potential of CGP for improving outcomes. CGP should be strongly considered in the management of BTC patients.

Of 449 patients with gallbladder cancer, 207 cases (46%) were discovered incidentally and underwent reoperation at 3 different time intervals from the date of the original cholecystectomy: group A: less than 4 weeks (25 patients, 12%); B: 4 to 8 weeks (91 patients, 44%); C: more than 8 weeks (91 patients, 44%). The mean (SD) ages of patients in groups A, B, and C were 65 (9), 64 (11), and 66 (12) years, respectively. All groups were similar for baseline demographics, extent of resection, presence of residual disease, T stage, resection margin status, lymph node involvement, and postoperative complications. Patients who underwent reoperation between 4 and 8 weeks had the longest median overall survival (group B: 40.4 months) compared with those who underwent early (group A: 17.4 months) or late (group C: 22.4 months) reoperation (log-rank P = .03). Group A and C time intervals (vs group B), presence of residual disease, an R2 resection, advanced T stage, and lymph node involvement were associated with decreased overall survival on univariable Cox regression. Only group A (hazard ratio, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.25-5.54) and group C (hazard ratio, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.17-3.66) time intervals (vs group B), R2 resection (hazard ratio, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.27-5.69), and advanced Tstage (hazard ratio, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.11-3.08) persisted on multivariable Cox regression analysis.

Clinical features and response to systemic therapy in a historical cohort of advanced or unresectable mucosal melanoma.,Melanoma research,Melanoma Res.,2017-02-01,"There are very few data available regarding the pattern of first metastases in resected mucosal melanomas (MMs) as well as the response of advanced MM to cytotoxic therapy. A retrospective, single-institution cohort was assembled of all patients with advanced/unresectable MM between 1995 and 2012 who had received systemic therapy with available imaging (N=81). Responses to first-line and second-line systemic therapy were assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. The relationship between response, overall survival, and clinical covariates was investigated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Primary sites included anorectal (N=31, 38%), vulvovaginal (N=28, 35%), head and neck (N=21, 26%), and gallbladder (N=1, 1%) mucosa. Seven percent of patients had their first relapse in the brain. Cytotoxic therapy represented 82 and 51% of first-line and second-line regimens. The best response achieved in the first-line setting was similar for single-agent [10%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1-32%] and combination alkylator therapy (8%; 95% CI: 2-21%). Median overall survival from first-line treatment was 10.3 months (95% CI: 8.7-13.9 months). Patients with elevated lactic dehydrogenase [hazard ratio (HR): 1.87, 95% CI: 1.10-3.19, P=0.020] and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 1-2 (HR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.05-2.72, P=0.030) had a higher risk of death, whereas patients with 12-week objective responses had a lower risk of death (HR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.04-0.41, P<0.001).

A Novel Pathology-Based Preoperative Risk Score to Predict Locoregional Residual and Distant Disease and Survival for Incidental Gallbladder Cancer: A 10-Institution Study from the U.S. Extrahepatic Biliary Malignancy Consortium.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2016-11-03,"This study was designed to develop a more robust predictive model, beyond T-stage alone, for incidental gallbladder cancer (IGBC) for discovering locoregional residual (LRD) and distant disease (DD) at reoperation, and estimating overall survival (OS). T-stage alone is currently used to guide treatment for incidental gallbladder cancer. Residual disease at re-resection is the most important factor in predicting outcomes. All patients with IGBC who underwent reoperation at 10 institutions from 2000 to 2015 were included. Routine pathology data from initial cholecystectomy was utilized to create the gallbladder cancer predictive risk score (GBRS). Of 449 patients with gallbladder cancer, 262 (58 %) were incidentally discovered and underwent reoperation. Advanced T-stage, grade, and presence of lymphovascular (LVI) and perineural (PNI) invasion were all associated with increased rates of DD and LRD and decreased OS. Each pathologic characteristic was assigned a value (T1a: 0, T1b: 1, T2: 2, T3/4: 3; well-diff: 1, mod-diff: 2, poor-diff: 3; LVI-neg: 1, LVI-pos: 2; PNI-neg: 1, PNI-pos: 2), which added to a total GBRS score from 3 to 10. The scores were separated into three risk-groups (low: 3-4, intermediate: 5-7, high: 8-10). Each progressive GBRS group was associated with an increased incidence LRD and DD at the time of re-resection and reduced OS. By accounting for subtle pathologic variations within each T-stage, this novel predictive risk-score better stratifies patients with incidentally discovered gallbladder cancer. Compared with T-stage alone, it more accurately identifies patients at risk for locoregional-residual and distant disease and predicts long-term survival as it redistributes T1b, T2, and T3 disease across separate risk-groups based on additional biologic features. This score may help to optimize treatment strategy for patients with incidentally discovered gallbladder cancer.",Journal Article,1174.0,29.0,This study was designed to develop a more robust predictive model beyond T-stage alone for incidental cancer IGBC for discovering locoregional residual LRD and distant disease DD at reoperation and estimating overall survival OS T-stage alone is currently used to guide treatment for incidental cancer Residual disease at re-resection is the most important factor in predicting outcomes All patients with IGBC who underwent reoperation at 10 institutions from 2000 to 2015 were included Routine pathology data from initial cholecystectomy was utilized to create the cancer predictive risk score GBRS Of 449 patients with cancer 262 58 were incidentally discovered and underwent reoperation Advanced T-stage grade and presence of lymphovascular LVI and perineural PNI invasion were all associated with increased rates of DD and LRD and decreased OS Each pathologic characteristic was assigned a value T1a 0 T1b 1 T2 2 T3/4 3 well-diff 1 mod-diff 2 poor-diff 3 LVI-neg 1 LVI-pos 2 PNI-neg 1 PNI-pos 2 which added to a total GBRS score from 3 to 10 The scores were separated into three risk-groups low 3-4 intermediate 5-7 high 8-10 Each progressive GBRS group was associated with an increased incidence LRD and DD at the time of re-resection and reduced OS By accounting for subtle pathologic variations within each T-stage this novel predictive risk-score better stratifies patients with incidentally discovered cancer Compared with T-stage alone it more accurately identifies patients at risk for locoregional-residual and distant disease and predicts long-term survival as it redistributes T1b T2 and T3 disease across separate risk-groups based on additional biologic features This score may help to optimize treatment strategy for patients with incidentally discovered cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[26, 45, 10, 1114, 6, 690, 8, 80, 1922, 464, 202, 1654, 102, 82, 279, 9, 4490, 12, 14678, 9, 10750, 1325, 753, 26207, 2, 626, 34, 6952, 28, 5077, 2, 4563, 63, 25, 118, 102, 82, 279, 16, 694, 95, 6, 1597, 24, 9, 4490, 12, 753, 34, 28, 1491, 170, 16, 3, 96, 305, 161, 4, 1434, 123, 62, 7, 5, 14678, 54, 208, 5077, 28, 79, 1764, 29, 1081, 6, 1483, 11, 159, 1311, 1117, 74, 29, 388, 8493, 10, 2080, 6, 3736, 3, 12, 464, 43, 368, 41592, 1, 8865, 7, 5, 12, 7801, 717, 11, 5925, 2747, 2, 208, 5077, 131, 102, 82, 88, 2, 463, 1, 2933, 3327, 2, 4917, 5109, 578, 11, 62, 41, 5, 101, 151, 1, 6952, 2, 26207, 2, 340, 118, 296, 510, 2037, 10, 896, 8, 549, 5710, 13, 6142, 14, 1786, 18, 2065, 39, 27, 149, 29104, 14, 27164, 29104, 18, 334, 29104, 27, 3327, 8696, 14, 3327, 7833, 18, 5109, 8696, 14, 5109, 7833, 18, 92, 1953, 6, 8, 181, 41592, 368, 29, 27, 6, 79, 3, 703, 11, 4910, 237, 169, 43, 271, 154, 27, 39, 919, 33, 67, 64, 66, 79, 296, 1014, 41592, 87, 10, 41, 5, 35, 101, 287, 26207, 2, 6952, 28, 3, 98, 1, 1491, 170, 2, 405, 118, 20, 3116, 9, 7543, 510, 2293, 262, 296, 102, 82, 26, 229, 464, 43, 368, 380, 12391, 7, 5, 5925, 2747, 12, 72, 5, 102, 82, 279, 192, 80, 2141, 2953, 7, 28, 43, 9, 1325, 753, 2, 626, 34, 2, 2623, 319, 337, 25, 22, 192, 69299, 6142, 1786, 2, 2065, 34, 716, 2282, 43, 271, 90, 23, 402, 1283, 404, 26, 368, 68, 987, 6, 2465, 24, 692, 9, 7, 5, 5925, 2747, 12]",1778.0,27812827,63
"Biliary tract cancers: epidemiology, molecular pathogenesis and genetic risk associations.",Chinese clinical oncology,Chin Clin Oncol,2016-10-01,"Biliary tract cancers (BTC) are malignancies that arise from the epithelium of the biliary system and comprise the second most common type of hepatobiliary cancer worldwide. BTC are sub-classified as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), perhilar/hilar cholangiocarcinoma (pCCA), distal cholangiocarcinoma (dCCA), and gallbladder carcinoma. Due to the differences in their etiologic risk factors, pathogenesis, and molecular and genetic characteristics, each of these subtypes is considered a separate biological entity. The geographic diversity of risk factors for the subtypes of biliary cancers results in profound differences in the worldwide incidence of each.

Biliary carcinomas: pathology and the role of DNA mismatch repair deficiency.,Chinese clinical oncology,Chin Clin Oncol,2016-10-01,"The pathology of biliary carcinomas is diverse with different gross and histological features in tumors arising in the different segments of the biliary system. Various epidemiological risk factors, varied genetic makeup, and tissue microenvironment are contributory factors. As biliary tumors have been shown to be a part of the Lynch syndrome tumor spectrum, it is plausible to speculate that DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency plays a role in biliary tumors. Literature data suggest that DNA MMR deficiency indeed occurs in these tumors, albeit infrequently with the reported frequencies (weighted for sample size) of high level microsatellite instability (MSI) being 5% each for gallbladder carcinoma and carcinoma of extra-hepatic bile ducts, and 10% each for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and ampullary carcinoma. Importantly, the presence of MMR deficiency in these tumors has been shown to have different implications with regard to its association with Lynch syndrome, tumor histological features, and other clinical characteristics, when compared with non-biliary tumors or among the biliary tumors from the different segments of the biliary system.

Systemic therapy for biliary cancers.,Chinese clinical oncology,Chin Clin Oncol,2016-10-01,"Biliary tract cancers represent an uncommon, heterogenous malignant group of tumors that include gallbladder cancers (GBC) and cholangiocarcinomas that are frequently detected in the locally advanced or metastatic setting. The randomized phase III ABC-02 trial established the combination regimen of cisplatin plus gemcitabine as standard of care therapy. Nevertheless, despite prior and subsequent attempts utilizing a variety of treatment strategies clinical outcomes for these cancers remains disappointing, necessitating the innate call for improvements in treatment approaches. In this article, we provide an overview of prior first line studies of single, doublet and triplet systemic chemotherapy regimens as well as attempts to incorporate agents that target the EGFR and VEGF pathways in combination with a cytotoxic backbone and the current role of chemotherapy in the second line setting. Additionally, molecular profiling has the capability to identify genetic alterations to help guide rational treatment approaches; we highlight the molecular diverse profile within biliary cancer and the prior, current and emergent role of targeted therapy in biliary cancers as well as the ongoing investigational assessment of immunotherapy. Overall, combination therapy is superior to single agent therapy in the first line setting. For second line therapy, enrollment on to clinical trials is paramount as no standard of care currently exists and no specific regimen has shown a significant better outcome. Limitations of chemotherapy have been exposed and future trials must have a logical design with incorporation of biomarkers that can aid prognosis or predict benefit to therapy. Advances in genomic sequencing can allow identification of potential actionable targets that can be exploited therapeutically which is already underway with the targeting of FGFR2 fusions and IDH1/2 mutations in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC).

We explored the safety/efficacy and potential biomarkers for bevacizumab in combination with gemcitabine-capecitabine in advanced BTCs. Inoperable stage III/IV BTC patients in our prospective study were given 1000 mg/m of gemcitabine (on days 1, 8), 650 mg/m of capecitabine (on days 1 to 14), and 15 mg/kg of bevacizumab (on day 1) in 21-day cycles. Circulating tumor cells and quality of life were assessed at baseline and before cycle 2 and 3. In total, 50 patients with gallbladder cancer (22%), intrahepatic (58%), and extrahepatic (20%) cholangiocarcinoma, received a median of 8 treatment cycles for median treatment duration of 5.8 months. Common grade 3/4 toxicities were neutropenia (36%), thrombocytopenia (16%), fatigue (20%), infections (14%), and hand-foot syndrome (10%). There were 12 partial response (24%), 24 stable disease (48%) with clinical benefit rate of 72%. Median progression-free survival was 8.1 months (95% confidence interval, 5.3-9.9). Median overall survival was 10.2 months (95% confidence interval, 7.5-13.7). Circulating tumor cells were identified at baseline in 21/46 patients (46%), who had lower median overall survival compared with those without (9.4 vs. 13.7 mo; P=0.29). Patients with quality of life scores greater than the group median by the end of first cycle of treatment had improved survival compared with those who did not (13.3 vs. 9.4 mo; P=0.39).

Laparoscopic Glissonean Pedicle Transection (Takasaki) for Negative Fluorescent Counterstaining of Segment 6.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2016-12-19,"The portal pedicles are wrapped in connective tissue known as the Walaeus sheath, which abut Laennec's capsule covering the liver parenchyma. Precise knowledge of this anatomic relationship allows for dissection of this interspace and early control of the segmental portal pedicle (Glissonean pedicle transection method [GPTM], Takasaki approach). <sup>1,2</sup> Subsequent systemic administration of indocyanine green (ICG) leads to negative counterstaining of the segment to be resected. The patient was a 60-year-old healthy woman with invasive lobular breast cancer, grade 2, which was estrogen receptor-positive (ER +), progesterone receptor-positive (PR +), human epidermal growth factor-negative (HER2-), Ki-67 80%, and cT2N0M1. A synchronous solitary liver metastasis between segments 6 and 7 was diagnosed. After treatment with letrozole and palbociclib for 1 year had achieved stable disease, the patient was considered for liver metastasectomy. <sup>3,4</sup> METHODS: After an intraoperative ultrasound, the patient was placed in the French position, <sup>5</sup> and the gallbladder was disconnected from the cystic duct for exposure of the hepatoduodenal ligament. The hilar plate was lowered, and the portal pedicle of segment 6 was dissected out using the GPTM approach. After test-clamping, an appropriate demarcation was observed, and ICG was administered systemically. This led to negative counterstaining of segment 6 and allowed for precise anatomic dissection under near-infrared vision. Laparoscopic application of GPTM facilitates anatomically precise liver resection through early pedicle control.

Thirty-nine days later he developed acute cholecystitis, which was managed with a cholecystostomy tube. Two months later, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed where a T2 well- to moderately-differentiated gallbladder cancer was detected, along with an uninvolved lymph node in station 12c, and cystic duct stump negative for cancer. With the patient in the French position, wide kocherization allowed for sampling of lymph node stations 13 (retropancreatic) and 16 (aortocaval). Thereafter, a portal lymphadenectomy of stations 12a, b, c and p was performed. A partial resection of segments 4b and 5, as well as sampling of the cystic duct stump, completed the procedure. Accurate prognostication is one of the major goals of oncologic re-resection of incidentally discovered gallbladder cancer. This can be achieved via a systematic and complete dissection of portal, aortocaval and retropancreatic lymph node stations.

A multicenter assessment of the ability of preoperative computed tomography scan and CA-125 to predict gross residual disease at primary debulking for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2017-02-14,"To assess the ability of preoperative computed tomography scan and CA-125 to predict gross residual disease (RD) at primary cytoreduction in advanced ovarian cancer. A prospective, non-randomized, multicenter trial of patients who underwent primary debulking for stage III-IV epithelial ovarian cancer previously identified 9 criteria associated with suboptimal (>1cm residual) cytoreduction. This is a secondary post-hoc analysis looking at the ability to predict any RD. Four clinical and 18 radiologic criteria were assessed, and a multivariate model predictive of RD was developed. From 7/2001-12/2012, 350 patients met eligibility criteria. The complete gross resection rate was 33%. On multivariate analysis, 3 clinical and 8 radiologic criteria were significantly associated with the presence of any RD: age≥60years (OR=1.5); CA-125≥600U/mL (OR=1.3); ASA 3-4 (OR=1.6); lesions in the root of the superior mesenteric artery (OR=4.1), splenic hilum/ligaments (OR=1.4), lesser sac >1cm (OR=2.2), gastrohepatic ligament/porta hepatis (OR=1.4), gallbladder fossa/intersegmental fissure (OR=2); suprarenal retroperitoneal lymph nodes (OR=1.3); small bowel adhesions/thickening (OR=1.1); and moderate-severe ascites (OR=2.2). All ORs were significant with p<0.01. A 'predictive score' was assigned to each criterion based on its multivariate OR, and the rate of having any RD for patients who had a total score of 0-2, 3-5, 6-8, and ≥9 was 45%, 68%, 87%, and 96%, respectively.

Systemic Chemotherapy Combined with Resection for Locally Advanced Gallbladder Carcinoma: Surgical and Survival Outcomes.,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,J. Am. Coll. Surg.,2017-02-13,"Preoperative chemotherapy is a strategy for converting to resection and/or assessing disease biology before operation. The utility of such an approach in gallbladder carcinoma (GBCA) is unknown. This study evaluated outcomes of GBCA patients treated with chemotherapy for locally advanced or lymph node-involved tumors. Patients who received systemic chemotherapy for locally advanced or lymph node-positive GBCA were identified from a departmental database. Patients were excluded if there was any evidence of distant metastases or if records were inadequate to determine initial chemotherapy and response. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), operative results, and overall survival (OS) were assessed. Seventy-four patients were included, from 1992 to 2015. Eighty-nine percent of patients (n = 64) were treated with gemcitabine and 57% with gemcitabine/platinum (n = 42). At initial response assessment, 17 patients (23%) had progression. The remaining patients had stable disease (n = 38, 51%) or partial response (n = 19, 26%). Twenty-two patients (30%) underwent attempt at resection, which was definitive for 10 patients (14%). Median OS for the entire cohort was 14 months (95% CI 11.3 to 17.9). Among patients with surgery, definitive resection was associated with a median OS of 51 months (95% CI 11.7 to 55.3) compared with 11 months (95% CI 4.1 to 23.6) for those with unresectable disease (p = 0.003).

Pooled analyses were conducted of 19 prospective population-based cohorts included in the Asia Cohort Consortium, comprising data from 658,611 East Asians and 112,686 South Asians. HRs were used to compare individuals with diabetes at baseline with those without diabetes for the risk of death from any cancer and from site-specific cancers, including cancers of the oesophagus, stomach, colorectum, colon, rectum, liver, bile duct, pancreas, lung, breast, endometrium, cervix, ovary, prostate, bladder, kidney and thyroid, as well as lymphoma and leukaemia. During a mean follow-up of 12.7 years, 37,343 cancer deaths (36,667 in East Asians and 676 in South Asians) were identified. Baseline diabetes status was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of death from any cancer (HR 1.26; 95% CI 1.21, 1.31).

Gallbladder toxicity and high-dose ablative-intent radiation for liver tumors: Should we constrain the dose?,Practical radiation oncology,Pract Radiat Oncol,2017-02-09,"Little is known about the risk of gallbladder toxicity from hypofractionated (HFXRT) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). We report on gallbladder toxicity and attribution to treatment in a prospective series of patients with primary and metastatic liver tumors receiving ablative-intent HFXRT and SBRT with protons. We evaluated 93 patients with intact gallbladders enrolled in either of 2 trials investigating proton HFXRT and SBRT for primary and metastatic liver tumors from 2009 to 2014. Patients received 45 to 67.5 GyE in 15 fractions for primary liver tumors (n = 45) and 30 to 50 GyE in 5 fractions for metastatic tumors (n = 48). No gallbladder dose constraints were used at treatment, and gallbladder volumes and dose-volume histograms were created retrospectively. Attributable toxicity was defined as cholecystitis or perforation without preexisting gallbladder disease. Baseline factors were evaluated using Fisher exact test and the nonparametric K-sample test. At baseline, 25 patients had preexisting cholelithiasis and 15 underwent biliary stenting before or after RT. Median follow-up after treatment was 11.8 months (range, 0.1-59.2 months). Despite maximum gallbladder doses >70 GyE in 41%, >80 GyE in 31%, and >90 GyE in 13% (equieffective dose at 2 Gy [EQD2], α/β = 3), there were no attributable cases of gallbladder toxicity. Two patients developed grade 3 and 4 cholecystitis 16 and 2 months after treatment, respectively, and both had a strong history of preexisting cholelithiasis and biliary stenting.

Incidental Gallbladder Cancer: Residual Cancer Discovered at Oncologic Extended Resection Determines Outcome: A Report from High- and Low-Incidence Countries.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2017-04-17,"Gallbladder cancer detected incidentally after cholecystectomy (IGBC) currently is the most common diagnosis of gallbladder cancer, and oncologic extended resection (OER) is recommended for tumors classified higher than T1b. However, the precise prognostic significance of residual cancer (RC) found at the time of OER has not been well established. This analysis aimed to determine the prognostic impact of RC found in patients with IGBC undergoing OER. Outcomes for IGBC at a center for a low-incidence country (USA) and a high-incidence country (Chile) between January 1999 and June 2015 were analyzed. Residual cancer was defined as histologically proven cancer at OER. Predictors of disease-specific survival (DSS) were analyzed. Of 187 patients, 171 (91.4%) achieved complete resection (R0) at OER. The rates of surgical mortality and severe morbidity were respectively 1.1 and 9.6%. Of the 187 patients, 73 (39%) had RC. Perineural invasion and/or lymphovascular invasion and T3 stage were associated with the presence of RC. In both countries, RC was associated with a significantly shorter median survival (23% vs not reached; p < 0.001) and lower 5-year DSS rate (19% vs. 74%; p < 0.001) despite R0 resection. In the multivariable analysis, RC was an independent poor predictor of DSS (hazard ratio [HR], 4.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.13-7.47; p < 0.001), as were lymphovascular and/or perineural invasion (HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.19-3.21; p = 0.008). The presence of RC in patients undergoing OER for IGBC is associated with poor DSS in both high- and low-incidence countries, even when R0 resection is achieved.

Gallbladder Cancer Presenting with Jaundice: Uniformly Fatal or Still Potentially Curable?,Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,J. Gastrointest. Surg.,2017-05-11,"Jaundice as a presenting symptom of gallbladder cancer has traditionally been considered to be a sign of advanced disease, inoperability, and poor outcome. However, recent studies have demonstrated that a small subset of these patients can undergo resection with curative intent. Patients with gallbladder cancer managed surgically from 2000 to 2014 in 10 US academic institutions were stratified based on the presence of jaundice at presentation (defined as bilirubin ≥4 mg/ml or requiring preoperative biliary drainage). Perioperative morbidity, mortality, and overall survival were compared between jaundiced and non-jaundiced patients. Of 400 gallbladder cancer patients with available preoperative data, 108 (27%) presented with jaundice while 292 (73%) did not. The fraction of patients who eventually underwent curative-intent resection was much lower in the presence of jaundice (n = 33, 30%) than not (n = 218, 75%; P < 0.001). Jaundiced patients experienced higher perioperative morbidity (69 vs. 38%; P = 0.002), including a much higher need for reoperation (12 vs. 1%; P = 0.003). However, 90-day mortality (6.5 vs. 3.6%; P = 0.35) was not significantly higher. Overall survival after resection was worse in jaundiced patients (median 14 vs. 32 months; P < 0.001).

The incidence rates and survival of gallbladder cancer in the USA.,European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP),Eur. J. Cancer Prev.,2019-01-01,"Gallbladder cancer is a rare malignancy in most countries. The racial and sociodemographic factors associated with its incidence and survival are poorly defined. We aimed to investigate population-based gallbladder cancer incidence and survival trends on the basis of clinical characteristics and sociodemographic factors in the USA. Gallbladder cancer incidence and survival data from 2001 to 2012 were obtained from 18 registries of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Incidence rates and Joinpoint trends were calculated by demographic subgroup. Survival trends were assessed using Cox proportional hazard models. A total of 7769 patients were identified. The overall gallbladder cancer incidence rates did not significantly change during the 2001-2012 period. Incidence rates were three times higher in Hispanics and 1.6 times higher in Blacks compared with Whites. Over the time period, incidence rates significantly increased among Blacks and decreased among Hispanics. Male sex [hazard ratio (HR): 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.17], older age (HR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.53-1.96), and single and divorced statuses (HR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.09-1.30 and 1.12, 95% CI: 1.01-1.24) were independently associated with shorter overall survival, whereas higher education (HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.82-0.97) and higher income (HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.82-0.96) were associated with longer survival.

Pathologic and Prognostic Implications of Incidental <i>versus</i> Nonincidental Gallbladder Cancer: A 10-Institution Study from the United States Extrahepatic Biliary Malignancy Consortium.,The American surgeon,Am Surg,2017-07-01,"Most gallbladder cancers (GBCs) are discovered incidentally after routine cholecystectomy. The influence of timing of diagnosis on disease stage, treatment, and prognosis is not known. Patients with GBC who underwent resection at 10 institutions from 2000 to 2015 were included. Patients diagnosed incidentally (IGBC) and nonincidentally (non-IGBC) were compared. Primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Of 445 patients with GBC, 266 (60%) were IGBC and 179 (40%) were non-IGBC. Compared with IGBC, non-IGBC patients were more likely to have R2 resections (43% vs 19%; P < 0.001), advanced T-stage (T3/T4: 70% vs 40%; P < 0.001), high-grade tumors (50% vs 31%; P < 0.001), lymphovascular invasion (64% vs 45%; P = 0.01), and positive lymph nodes (60% vs 43%; P = 0.009). Receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy was similar between groups (49% vs 49%). Non-IGBC was associated with worse median OS compared with IGBC (17 vs 32 months; P < 0.001), which persisted among stage III patients (12 vs 29 months; P < 0.001), but not stages I, II, or IV. Despite accounting for other adverse pathologic factors (grade, T-stage, lymphovascular invasion, margin, lymph node), adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved OS only in stage III IGBC, but not in non-IGBC. Compared with incidental discovery, non-IGBC is associated with reduced OS, which is most evident in stage III disease. Despite being well matched for other adverse pathologic factors, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved survival only in stage III patients with incidentally discovered cancer. This underscores the importance of timing of diagnosis in GBC and suggests that these two groups may represent a distinct biology of disease, and the same treatment paradigm may not be appropriate.",Comparative Study,934.0,9.0,Most cancers GBCs are discovered incidentally after routine cholecystectomy The influence of timing of diagnosis on disease stage treatment and prognosis is not known Patients with GBC who underwent resection at 10 institutions from 2000 to 2015 were included Patients diagnosed incidentally IGBC and nonincidentally non-IGBC were compared Primary outcome was overall survival OS Of 445 patients with GBC 266 60 were IGBC and 179 40 were non-IGBC Compared with IGBC non-IGBC patients were more likely to have R2 resections 43 vs 19 P 0.001 advanced T-stage T3/T4 70 vs 40 P 0.001 high-grade tumors 50 vs 31 P 0.001 lymphovascular invasion 64 vs 45 P 0.01 and positive lymph nodes 60 vs 43 P 0.009 Receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy was similar between groups 49 vs 49 Non-IGBC was associated with worse median OS compared with IGBC 17 vs 32 months P 0.001 which persisted among stage III patients 12 vs 29 months P 0.001 but not stages I II or IV Despite accounting for other adverse pathologic factors grade T-stage lymphovascular invasion margin lymph node adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved OS only in stage III IGBC but not in non-IGBC Compared with incidental discovery non-IGBC is associated with reduced OS which is most evident in stage III disease Despite being well matched for other adverse pathologic factors adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved survival only in stage III patients with incidentally discovered cancer This underscores the importance of timing of diagnosis in GBC and suggests that these two groups may represent a distinct biology of disease and the same treatment paradigm may not be appropriate,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[96, 163, 22814, 32, 2747, 5925, 50, 1311, 8493, 3, 1054, 1, 1972, 1, 147, 23, 34, 82, 24, 2, 356, 16, 44, 440, 7, 5, 6344, 54, 208, 170, 28, 79, 1764, 29, 1081, 6, 1483, 11, 159, 7, 265, 5925, 14678, 2, 70900, 220, 14678, 11, 72, 86, 228, 10, 63, 25, 118, 1, 9398, 7, 5, 6344, 8786, 335, 11, 14678, 2, 5977, 327, 11, 220, 14678, 72, 5, 14678, 220, 14678, 7, 11, 80, 322, 6, 47, 4332, 2185, 601, 105, 326, 19, 13, 144, 131, 102, 82, 2065, 2463, 431, 105, 327, 19, 13, 144, 64, 88, 57, 212, 105, 456, 19, 13, 144, 2933, 578, 660, 105, 512, 19, 13, 355, 2, 109, 263, 502, 335, 105, 601, 19, 13, 2376, 1699, 1, 249, 56, 10, 288, 59, 271, 739, 105, 739, 220, 14678, 10, 41, 5, 639, 52, 118, 72, 5, 14678, 269, 105, 531, 53, 19, 13, 144, 92, 3760, 107, 82, 316, 7, 133, 105, 462, 53, 19, 13, 144, 84, 44, 1153, 70, 215, 15, 478, 550, 3116, 9, 127, 290, 510, 130, 88, 102, 82, 2933, 578, 959, 263, 289, 249, 56, 10, 41, 5, 231, 118, 158, 4, 82, 316, 14678, 84, 44, 4, 220, 14678, 72, 5, 4490, 1574, 220, 14678, 16, 41, 5, 405, 118, 92, 16, 96, 2853, 4, 82, 316, 34, 550, 486, 149, 655, 9, 127, 290, 510, 130, 249, 56, 10, 41, 5, 231, 25, 158, 4, 82, 316, 7, 5, 5925, 2747, 12, 26, 6926, 3, 1187, 1, 1972, 1, 147, 4, 6344, 2, 844, 17, 46, 100, 271, 68, 1231, 8, 834, 891, 1, 34, 2, 3, 827, 24, 2431, 68, 44, 40, 870]",1653.0,28738935,152
Extended Lymphadenectomy Is Required for Incidental Gallbladder Cancer Independent of Cystic Duct Lymph Node Status.,Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,J. Gastrointest. Surg.,2017-07-27,"We examined whether the incidental cystic duct nodal status predicts the status of the hepatoduodenal ligament (D1) or common hepatic artery, the pancreaticoduodenal and paraaortic lymph nodes (D2), and the overall prognosis and thus indicates whether an oncologic extended resection (OER) is required. The study included patients who underwent OER for incidental gallbladder cancer (IGBC) during 1999-2015. Associations between a positive cystic duct node and D2 nodal status and disease-specific survival (DSS) were analyzed. One-hundred-eight-seven patients were included. Seventy-three patients (39%) had the incidental cystic duct node retrieved. Cystic duct node positivity was associated with positive D1 (odds ratio 5.2, p = 0.012) but not with D2. Among all patients, a positive cystic duct node was associated with worse DSS (hazard ratio [HR] 2.09). Patients without residual cancer at OER and positive incidental cystic duct node had similar DSS to patients with negative nodes 70 vs 60% (p = 0.337).

Surgical Site Infection Is Associated with Tumor Recurrence in Patients with Extrahepatic Biliary Malignancies.,Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,J. Gastrointest. Surg.,2017-09-14,"Surgical site infections (SSI) are one of the most common complications after hepato-pancreato-biliary surgery. Infectious complications may lead to an associated immune-modulatory effect that inhibits the body's response to cancer surveillance. We sought to define the impact of SSI on long-term prognosis of patients undergoing surgical resection of extrahepatic biliary malignancies (EHBM). Patients undergoing surgery for EHBM between 2000 and 2014 were identified using a large, multi-center, national cohort dataset. Recurrence free survival (RFS) was calculated and a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was utilized to identify potential risk factors for RFS including SSI. Seven hundred twenty-eight patients included in the analytic cohort; 236 (32.4%) patients had perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, 241 (33.1%) gallbladder cancer, and 251 (34.5%) distal cholangiocarcinoma. A major resection, liver resection, was performed in 205 (28.3%) patients, while 110 (15.2%) patients had a pancreaticoduodenectomy. The overall incidence of morbidity was 55.8%; among the 397 patients who experienced a complication, 161 patients specifically had an SSI. The SSI occurred as an infection of the surgical site (n = 70, 9.6%) or formation of an abscess in the operative bed (n = 91, 12.5%). SSI was associated with long-term survival as patients who experienced an SSI had a median RFS of 19.5 months compared with 30.5 months for those patients who did not have an SSI (HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.08-1.80; p = 0.01).

DDR2 and IFITM1 Are Prognostic Markers in Gallbladder Squamous Cell/Adenosquamous Carcinomas and Adenocarcinomas.,Pathology oncology research : POR,Pathol. Oncol. Res.,2017-10-17,"This study was conducted to investigate the expressions of DDR2 and IFITM1 and their clinical and pathological significances in the rare type squamous cell/adenosquamous carcinomas (SC/ASC) and ordinary adenocarcinomas (AC) of gallbladder cancers. DDR2 and IFITM1 expression was examined in 69 SC/ASCs and 146 ACs using EnVision immunohistochemistry. Results showed that the percentage of positive DDR2 and IFITM1 expression was significantly higher in SC/ASC patients with high TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, invasion, and no resection surgery compared to patients with low TNM stages, no lymph node metastasis, no invasion, and resection surgery (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The positive rate of DDR2 was significantly higher in SC/ASC patients with large tumor sizes than patients with small tumor sizes (p < 0.05). The percentage of positive DDR2 and IFITM1 expressions was significantly higher in AC patients with high TNM stages that didn't receive resection surgery compared to patients with low TNM stages that did receive resection surgery (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The positive rate of IFITM1 was significantly higher in AC patients with lymph node metastasis and invasion than in patients without metastasis and invasion (p < 0.05). Positive DDR2 and IFITM1 expression was closely associated with a decreased overall survival in SC/ASC and AC patients (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01).

Clinical and Genetic Implications of DNA Mismatch Repair Deficiency in Biliary Tract Cancers Associated with Lynch Syndrome.,Journal of gastrointestinal cancer,J Gastrointest Cancer,2018-03-01,"Patients with Lynch syndrome (LS) have a significantly elevated lifetime risk of developing biliary tract cancers (BTCs) compared to the general population. However, few studies have characterized the clinical characteristics, genetic features, or long-term outcomes of mismatch-repair deficient (dMMR) cholangiocarcinomas associated with LS. A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained Familial High-Risk GI Cancer Clinic database identified all patients with BTCs evaluated from 2006 to 2016 who carried germline mutations in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2. Eleven patients with BTCs were identified: four perihilar, four intrahepatic, one extrahepatic, one gallbladder, and one ampulla of Vater. All patients had underlying germline mutations and a personal history of a LS-associated malignancy, most commonly (63.3%) colorectal cancer. Ten (90.9%) patients were surgically explored, and margin negative resection was possible in seven (63.3%). Chemotherapy (90.9%) and/or chemoradiation (45.5%) was administered to most patients. Among the seven patients presenting with non-metastatic disease who underwent surgical resection with curative intent, the 5-year overall survival rate was 53.3%. The median overall survival for the four patients not treated with curative intent was 17.2 months. dMMR biliary tract cancers associated with LS are rare but long-term outcomes may be more favorable than contemporaneous cohorts of non-Lynch-associated cholangiocarcinomas.

Surveillance for hepatobiliary cancers in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",Hepatology,2018-04-19,"Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and gallbladder carcinoma (GBCa). Surveillance for GBCa is recommended, but the clinical utility of surveillance for other hepatobiliary cancers (HBCa) in PSC, namely CCA and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), remains unclear. We aimed to determine whether surveillance is associated with better survival after diagnosis of HBCa in patients with PSC. Medical records of PSC patients seen at the Mayo Clinic Rochester from 1995 to 2015 were reviewed. Patients were included if they had ≥1 year of follow-up and developed HBCa. Patients were categorized according to their surveillance status (abdominal imaging, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, and alpha-fetoprotein). The primary endpoints were HBCa recurrence, HBCa-related death, and all-cause mortality. Overall survival was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier survival method; HBCa-related survival was assessed using competing risk regression. Tests of significance were two-tailed, and a P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. From 1995 to 2015, a total of 79 of 830 PSC patients were diagnosed with HBCa. Cumulative follow-up was 712 and 283 person-years pre- and post-HBCa diagnosis, respectively. Seventy-eight percent of patients (54/79) developed CCA, 21% (17/79) HCC, 6% (5/79) GBCa, 3% (2/79) both CCA and HCC, and 1% (1/79) both HCC and GBCa. Fifty-one percent (40/79) were under HBCa surveillance, and 49% (39/79) were not.

EpCAM-based Flow Cytometric Detection of Circulating Tumor Cells in Gallbladder Carcinoma Cases,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,Asian Pac. J. Cancer Prev.,2017-12-29,"Purpose: Liquid biopsy has entered the arena of cancer diagnostics in the past decade and detection of circulating
tumor cells (CTC) is one diagnostic component. CTCs in gallbladder cancer (GBC) have hitherto not been
comprehensively analysed. Methods and Results: The current study focused on the diagnostic role of CTCs in 27
cases of treatment-naive GBC and 6 normal controls as well as 6 cases of cholecystitis. An EasySep kit featuring
negative immunomagnetic bead separation and flow cytometric detection of EpCAM positive and CD45 negative cells
revealed CTCs in 25 of the 27 cases. At a cut-off point of ≥1, the CTC count discriminated GBC from controls with a
sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of 92.6%, 91.7% and 92.3%, respectively. CTC levels in turn correlated
significantly with clinico-pathological parameters of cases in terms of known prognostic indicators, with significant
diagnostic potential at a cut-off point of >4, to discriminate disease stage I and II vs. III and IV GBC. With a cut-off of
>3, the CTC count discriminated tumor stages I and II vs. III and IV and at >6 CTCs could discriminate metastatic vs.
non metastatic GBCs with a sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of 55. 6%, 100.0% and 85.2, respectively.

Association of perioperative transfusion with survival and recurrence after resection of gallbladder cancer: A 10-institution study from the US Extrahepatic Biliary Malignancy Consortium.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2018-05-14,"Perioperative blood transfusion is associated with poor outcomes in several malignancies. Its effect in gallbladder cancer (GBC) is unknown. All patients with GBC who underwent curative-intent resection at 10-institutions from 2000 to 2015 were included. The effect of blood transfusion on overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free (RFS) was evaluated. Of 262 patients with curative-intent resection for GBC, 61 patients (23%) received blood transfusions. Radical cholecystectomy was the most common procedure (80%), but major hepatectomy was more frequent in the transfusion versus no-transfusion group (13% vs 4%; P = 0.02). The transfusion group was less likely to have incidentally discovered disease (57% vs 74%) and receive adjuvant therapy (29% vs 48%), but more likely to have preoperative jaundice (23% vs 11%), T3/T4 tumors (60% vs 39%), LVI (71% vs 40%), PNI (71% vs 48%), and major complications (39% vs 12%) (all P < 0.05).

"Ramucirumab Plus Pembrolizumab in Patients with Previously Treated Advanced or Metastatic Biliary Tract Cancer: Nonrandomized, Open-Label, Phase I Trial (JVDF).",The oncologist,Oncologist,2018-05-31,"Ramucirumab plus pembrolizumab revealed no unexpected safety findings in patients with advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer, which is consistent with reports of other tumor cohorts within this phase Ia/b trial.Ramucirumab plus pembrolizumab did not demonstrate an improvement in overall survival when compared with historical controls in biomarker unselected, heavily pretreated patients with advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer.Patients with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive tumors had improved overall survival compared with patients with PD-L1-negative disease. Few treatment options exist for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC) following progression on gemcitabine-cisplatin. Preclinical evidence suggests that simultaneous blockade of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) and programmed death 1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) enhances antitumor effects. We assessed the safety and efficacy of ramucirumab, an IgG1 VEGFR-2 antagonist, with pembrolizumab, an IgG4 PD-1 antagonist, in biomarker-unselected patients with previously treated advanced or metastatic BTC. Patients had previously treated advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder, intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts, or ampulla of Vater. Ramucirumab 8 mg/kg was administered intravenously on days 1 and 8 with intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg on day 1 every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability of the combination. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Twenty-six patients were treated at 12 centers in five countries. Hypertension was the most common grade 3 treatment-related adverse event (TRAE), occurring in five patients. One patient experienced a grade 4 TRAE (neutropenia), and no treatment-related deaths occurred. Objective response rate was 4%.

Pre-operative Sarcopenia Identifies Patients at Risk for Poor Survival After Resection of Biliary Tract Cancers.,Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,J. Gastrointest. Surg.,2018-05-31,"Biliary tract cancers (BTC) are aggressive malignancies that require complex surgical procedures. Patients with BTC can present with skeletal muscle depletion, yet the effects of muscle wasting (sarcopenia) on outcomes have not been well studied. The objective of the current study was to define the impact of sarcopenia on survival among patients undergoing resection of BTC. Patients who underwent exploration for BTC who had a pre-operative CT scan available for review were identified. Body composition variables including total and psoas muscle area (cm<sup>2</sup>), muscle density (Hounsfield units), visceral fat area, subcutaneous fat area, and waist-to-hip ratio were analyzed at the level of L3. Outcomes were assessed according to the presence or absence of sarcopenia defined using sex- and BMI-specific threshold values for Psoas Muscle Index (PMI, cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>). Among 117 patients with BTC, 78 (67%) underwent curative-intent resection and 39 (33%) were explored but did not undergo resection due to metastatic/locally advanced disease. Tumor type included distal cholangiocarcinoma (n = 18, 15.4%), hilar cholangiocarcinoma (n = 27, 23.1%), gallbladder carcinoma (n = 52, 44.4%), and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (n = 20, 17.1%). Median patient age was 65.6 years and 43.6% were male. Mean patient BMI was 26.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup> among men and 27.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> among women. Overall, 41 (35.0%) patients had sarcopenia. Sarcopenia was associated with an increased risk of death among patients who underwent resection (HR 3.52, 95%CI 1.60-7.78, p = 0.002), which was comparable to patients with unresectable metastatic disease. Other factors such as low serum albumin (HR 3.17, 95% CI 1.30-7.74, p = 0.011) and low psoas density (HR 2.96, 95% CI 1.21-7.21, p = 0.017) were also associated with increased risk of death. Survival was stratified based on sarcopenia, psoas density, and serum albumin. The presence of each variable was associated with an incremental increased risk of death (0 variables ref.; 1 variable HR 3.8, 95% CI 1.0-14, p = 0.043; 2 variables HR 13.1, 95% CI 3.0-57.7, p = 0.001; 3 variables HR 14.6, 95% CI 2.5-87.1, p = 0.003). Patients who had no adverse prognostic factors had a 3-year OS of 67% versus no survival among patients with all 3 factors. Sarcopenia was common among patients undergoing resection of BTC, occurring in 1 of every 3 patients. Sarcopenia was associated with poor survival after resection, particularly among patients who experienced a recurrence. Body composition metrics such as sarcopenia and low psoas muscle density in addition to low albumin level were able to stratify patients into different prognostic categories.",Journal Article,600.0,7.0,Biliary tract cancers BTC are aggressive malignancies that require complex surgical procedures Patients with BTC can present with skeletal muscle depletion yet the effects of muscle wasting sarcopenia on outcomes have not been well studied The objective of the current study was to define the impact of sarcopenia on survival among patients undergoing resection of BTC Patients who underwent exploration for BTC who had a pre-operative CT scan available for review were identified Body composition variables including total and psoas muscle area cm sup 2 /sup muscle density Hounsfield units visceral fat area subcutaneous fat area and waist-to-hip ratio were analyzed at the level of L3 Outcomes were assessed according to the presence or absence of sarcopenia defined using sex- and BMI-specific threshold values for Psoas Muscle Index PMI cm sup 2 /sup /m sup 2 /sup Among 117 patients with BTC 78 67 underwent curative-intent resection and 39 33 were explored but did not undergo resection due to metastatic/locally advanced disease Tumor type included distal cholangiocarcinoma n 18 15.4 hilar cholangiocarcinoma n 27 23.1 carcinoma n 52 44.4 and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma n 20 17.1 Median patient age was 65.6 years and 43.6 were male Mean patient BMI was 26.1 kg/m sup 2 /sup among men and 27.5 kg/m sup 2 /sup among women Overall 41 35.0 patients had sarcopenia Sarcopenia was associated with an increased risk of death among patients who underwent resection HR 3.52 95 CI 1.60-7.78 p 0.002 which was comparable to patients with unresectable metastatic disease Other factors such as low serum albumin HR 3.17 95 CI 1.30-7.74 p 0.011 and low psoas density HR 2.96 95 CI 1.21-7.21 p 0.017 were also associated with increased risk of death Survival was stratified based on sarcopenia psoas density and serum albumin The presence of each variable was associated with an incremental increased risk of death 0 variables ref 1 variable HR 3.8 95 CI 1.0-14 p 0.043 2 variables HR 13.1 95 CI 3.0-57.7 p 0.001 3 variables HR 14.6 95 CI 2.5-87.1 p 0.003 Patients who had no adverse prognostic factors had a 3-year OS of 67 versus no survival among patients with all 3 factors Sarcopenia was common among patients undergoing resection of BTC occurring in 1 of every 3 patients Sarcopenia was associated with poor survival after resection particularly among patients who experienced a recurrence Body composition metrics such as sarcopenia and low psoas muscle density in addition to low albumin level were able to stratify patients into different prognostic categories,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2532, 1696, 163, 8112, 32, 571, 441, 17, 1353, 840, 221, 1369, 7, 5, 8112, 122, 364, 5, 2621, 1502, 2286, 1145, 3, 176, 1, 1502, 9807, 5579, 23, 123, 47, 44, 85, 149, 656, 3, 461, 1, 3, 291, 45, 10, 6, 1107, 3, 345, 1, 5579, 23, 25, 107, 7, 479, 170, 1, 8112, 7, 54, 208, 3370, 9, 8112, 54, 42, 8, 671, 1208, 425, 1657, 390, 9, 206, 11, 108, 642, 3761, 682, 141, 181, 2, 11839, 1502, 965, 494, 172, 18, 172, 1502, 1263, 16894, 2960, 2737, 2300, 965, 2529, 2300, 965, 2, 9653, 6, 5628, 197, 11, 311, 28, 3, 301, 1, 6869, 123, 11, 275, 768, 6, 3, 463, 15, 1127, 1, 5579, 395, 75, 1035, 2, 1140, 112, 2390, 1030, 9, 11839, 1502, 558, 24593, 494, 172, 18, 172, 188, 172, 18, 172, 107, 3843, 7, 5, 8112, 833, 598, 208, 1075, 1697, 170, 2, 587, 466, 11, 1443, 84, 205, 44, 1251, 170, 520, 6, 113, 795, 131, 34, 30, 267, 159, 2107, 2126, 78, 203, 167, 39, 4793, 2126, 78, 428, 382, 14, 134, 78, 653, 584, 39, 2, 3022, 2126, 78, 179, 269, 14, 52, 69, 89, 10, 556, 49, 60, 2, 601, 49, 11, 1045, 313, 69, 1140, 10, 432, 14, 503, 188, 172, 18, 172, 107, 325, 2, 428, 33, 503, 188, 172, 18, 172, 107, 117, 63, 605, 465, 13, 7, 42, 5579, 5579, 10, 41, 5, 35, 101, 43, 1, 273, 107, 7, 54, 208, 170, 168, 27, 653, 48, 58, 14, 335, 67, 833, 19, 13, 1111, 92, 10, 1279, 6, 7, 5, 1468, 113, 34, 127, 130, 225, 22, 154, 524, 2799, 168, 27, 269, 48, 58, 14, 201, 67, 794, 19, 13, 3651, 2, 154, 11839, 1263, 168, 18, 921, 48, 58, 14, 239, 67, 239, 19, 13, 3825, 11, 120, 41, 5, 101, 43, 1, 273, 25, 10, 1173, 90, 23, 5579, 11839, 1263, 2, 524, 2799, 3, 463, 1, 296, 1347, 10, 41, 5, 35, 3648, 101, 43, 1, 273, 13, 682, 7357, 14, 1347, 168, 27, 66, 48, 58, 14, 13, 213, 19, 13, 5653, 18, 682, 168, 233, 14, 48, 58, 27, 13, 696, 67, 19, 13, 144, 27, 682, 168, 213, 49, 48, 58, 18, 33, 912, 14, 19, 13, 1421, 7, 54, 42, 77, 290, 177, 130, 42, 8, 27, 111, 118, 1, 598, 185, 77, 25, 107, 7, 5, 62, 27, 130, 5579, 10, 186, 107, 7, 479, 170, 1, 8112, 1821, 4, 14, 1, 454, 27, 7, 5579, 10, 41, 5, 334, 25, 50, 170, 823, 107, 7, 54, 592, 8, 146, 642, 3761, 3589, 225, 22, 5579, 2, 154, 11839, 1502, 1263, 4, 352, 6, 154, 2799, 301, 11, 1665, 6, 3570, 7, 237, 338, 177, 1996]",2570.0,29855867,75

NETs most commonly originate in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract, although they may occur at any site in the body due to the wide distribution of neuroendocrine cells. Their classification system is complex and continues to evolve, and the current system uses histological grade in defining these subtypes. Neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs), or high-grade, poorly-differentiated NETs, are the most aggressive subtype. Surgical resection remains the primary treatment modality and may be curative, thus early diagnosis is paramount. Management of advanced NETs remains both a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge; however, advances in our understanding of these unique neoplasms as well as an evolving classification system has led to the development of adjunctive therapeutic approaches aimed to minimize morbidity and improve patient outcomes. CASE REPORT We present 6 cases of unusual sites of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas involving the cervix, gallbladder, oesophagus, ovary, prostate, and urinary bladder.

The role of next-generation sequencing in the differential diagnosis of composite neoplasms.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2018-06-26,"Composite neoplasms (CNs) are rare and diagnostically challenging lesions that require differentiating between mixed clonal tumors with divergent phenotypes (MT), collision of 2 independent tumors adjacent to each other (CT), and tumor-to-tumor metastasis (TTM). To that end, pathologists have traditionally used immunohistochemistry and limited molecular studies, such as Sanger sequencing. Herein we evaluate the potential application of NGS in the differential diagnosis of these rare neoplasms. Four CNs were included in the study. Two were diagnosed as MT (mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma of the gallbladder and metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma with squamous dedifferentiation) and 2 were interpreted as TTM (esophageal adenocarcinoma to lung adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma of the lung to meningeal melanoma). Diagnoses were made using clinical, histologic, and immunophenotypic information, with the aid of limited molecular studies in 2 cases. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was dissected for DNA and RNA extraction, and NGS was performed using the Oncomine Comprehensive Panel. The 2 tumors initially interpreted as MT showed shared genetic aberrations in the different neoplastic components, supporting the pathologic diagnosis. NGS results for the lesion diagnosed as esophageal adenocarcinoma metastatic to lung adenocarcinoma did not support the histopathologic interpretation and were deemed inconclusive. However, the identification of an identical CDKN2A mutation in all components and in the adjacent benign lung parenchyma suggests a possible germline aberration. Sequencing results in the last case were clearly supportive of TTM. This study illustrates the role of NGS in the diagnostic workup of CNs, as an adjunct to light microscopy and immunohistochemistry.",Case Reports,574.0,0.0,Composite neoplasms CNs are rare and diagnostically challenging lesions that require differentiating between mixed clonal tumors with divergent phenotypes MT collision of 2 independent tumors adjacent to each other CT and tumor-to-tumor metastasis TTM To that end pathologists have traditionally used immunohistochemistry and limited molecular studies such as Sanger sequencing Herein we evaluate the potential application of NGS in the differential diagnosis of these rare neoplasms Four CNs were included in the study Two were diagnosed as MT mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma of the and metastatic papillary carcinoma with squamous dedifferentiation and 2 were interpreted as TTM adenocarcinoma to adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma of the to meningeal Diagnoses were made using clinical histologic and immunophenotypic information with the aid of limited molecular studies in 2 cases Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue was dissected for DNA and RNA extraction and NGS was performed using the Oncomine Comprehensive Panel The 2 tumors initially interpreted as MT showed shared genetic aberrations in the different neoplastic components supporting the pathologic diagnosis NGS results for the lesion diagnosed as adenocarcinoma metastatic to adenocarcinoma did not support the histopathologic interpretation and were deemed inconclusive However the identification of an identical CDKN2A mutation in all components and in the adjacent benign parenchyma suggests a possible germline aberration Sequencing results in the last case were clearly supportive of TTM This study illustrates the role of NGS in the diagnostic workup of CNs as an adjunct to light microscopy and immunohistochemistry,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,"[3308, 1179, 1025, 32, 622, 2, 13778, 1950, 406, 17, 1353, 5209, 59, 1739, 1946, 57, 5, 8332, 2618, 4875, 21549, 1, 18, 306, 57, 2086, 6, 296, 127, 425, 2, 30, 6, 30, 278, 42097, 6, 17, 396, 3354, 47, 4206, 95, 888, 2, 383, 219, 94, 225, 22, 7285, 615, 1986, 21, 376, 3, 174, 1581, 1, 2650, 4, 3, 1777, 147, 1, 46, 622, 1179, 294, 1025, 11, 159, 4, 3, 45, 100, 11, 265, 22, 4875, 1739, 73138, 134, 1, 3, 2, 113, 1796, 134, 5, 691, 9496, 2, 18, 11, 5047, 22, 42097, 449, 6, 449, 2, 302, 31, 134, 1, 3, 6, 13543, 2403, 11, 1229, 75, 38, 884, 2, 6599, 487, 5, 3, 2427, 1, 383, 219, 94, 4, 18, 140, 3265, 1959, 2487, 2505, 246, 10, 7973, 9, 261, 2, 893, 5763, 2, 2650, 10, 173, 75, 3, 17919, 949, 993, 3, 18, 57, 1625, 5047, 22, 4875, 224, 2664, 336, 2152, 4, 3, 338, 2000, 1628, 1912, 3, 510, 147, 2650, 99, 9, 3, 1180, 265, 22, 449, 113, 6, 449, 205, 44, 538, 3, 2630, 3037, 2, 11, 3779, 6791, 137, 3, 911, 1, 35, 3038, 3175, 258, 4, 62, 1628, 2, 4, 3, 2086, 1002, 5388, 844, 8, 899, 1009, 7794, 615, 99, 4, 3, 1060, 473, 11, 2536, 1877, 1, 42097, 26, 45, 6342, 3, 200, 1, 2650, 4, 3, 752, 4755, 1, 1025, 22, 35, 5471, 6, 1691, 3804, 2, 888]",1702.0,29958927,3
Psoriasis and cancer. An Australian/New Zealand narrative.,The Australasian journal of dermatology,Australas. J. Dermatol.,2018-07-10,"Patients with psoriasis have an increased risk of cancer, which may be due to impaired immune surveillance, immune modulatory treatments, chronic inflammation and/or co-risk factors such as obesity. The increase in treatment-independent solid cancers, including urinary/bladder cancers, oropharynx/larynx, liver/gallbladder and colon/rectal cancers, seem to be linked to alcohol and smoking. Lung cancer and nonmelanoma skin cancer are also increased in patients with psoriasis. The risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer increases with age and severity of psoriasis. It is also higher in men, particularly for squamous cell carcinoma, which may reflect previous exposure to PUVA and/or ciclosporin. The risk of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is substantially higher in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Biologic therapies are independently associated with a slight increase risk of cancer, but this is less than ciclosporin, with the risk confounded by disease severity and other co-risk factors. The risk of cancer from low-dose methotrexate is likely minimal. In contrast, acitretin is likely protective against a variety of solid and haematological malignancies. The data on small molecule therapies such as apremilast are too immature for comment, although no signal has yet been identified. The decision whether to stop psoriasis immune modulatory treatments following a diagnosis of cancer, and when to resume, needs to be considered in the context of the patients' specific cancer. However, there is no absolute need to stop any treatment other than possibly ciclosporin, unless there is a concern over an increased risk of serious infection or drug-drug interaction with cancer-directed therapies, including radiotherapy.",Journal Article,560.0,1.0,Patients with psoriasis have an increased risk of cancer which may be due to impaired immune surveillance immune modulatory treatments chronic inflammation and/or co-risk factors such as obesity The increase in treatment-independent solid cancers including urinary/bladder cancers oropharynx/larynx liver/gallbladder and colon/rectal cancers seem to be linked to alcohol and smoking cancer and nonmelanoma cancer are also increased in patients with psoriasis The risk of nonmelanoma cancer increases with age and severity of psoriasis It is also higher in men particularly for squamous cell carcinoma which may reflect previous exposure to PUVA and/or ciclosporin The risk of cutaneous T-cell is substantially higher in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis Biologic therapies are independently associated with a slight increase risk of cancer but this is less than ciclosporin with the risk confounded by disease severity and other co-risk factors The risk of cancer from low-dose methotrexate is likely minimal In contrast acitretin is likely protective against a variety of solid and haematological malignancies The data on small molecule therapies such as apremilast are too immature for comment although no signal has yet been identified The decision whether to stop psoriasis immune modulatory treatments following a diagnosis of cancer and when to resume needs to be considered in the context of the patients specific cancer However there is no absolute need to stop any treatment other than possibly ciclosporin unless there is a concern over an increased risk of serious infection or drug-drug interaction with cancer-directed therapies including radiotherapy,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[7, 5, 14648, 47, 35, 101, 43, 1, 12, 92, 68, 40, 520, 6, 2364, 250, 617, 250, 11424, 640, 442, 1815, 2, 15, 1269, 43, 130, 225, 22, 1661, 3, 344, 4, 24, 306, 537, 163, 141, 1660, 9685, 163, 5333, 4308, 4094, 48193, 2, 13344, 21092, 163, 3233, 6, 40, 1199, 6, 2197, 2, 979, 12, 2, 7814, 12, 32, 120, 101, 4, 7, 5, 14648, 3, 43, 1, 7814, 12, 1106, 5, 89, 2, 1702, 1, 14648, 192, 16, 120, 142, 4, 325, 823, 9, 691, 31, 134, 92, 68, 2694, 698, 645, 6, 30749, 2, 15, 20302, 3, 43, 1, 1486, 102, 31, 16, 2109, 142, 4, 7, 5, 1163, 6, 905, 14648, 1283, 235, 32, 1042, 41, 5, 8, 8041, 344, 43, 1, 12, 84, 26, 16, 299, 76, 20302, 5, 3, 43, 8927, 20, 34, 1702, 2, 127, 1269, 43, 130, 3, 43, 1, 12, 29, 154, 61, 2116, 16, 322, 1048, 4, 748, 23924, 16, 322, 2864, 480, 8, 1362, 1, 537, 2, 5143, 441, 3, 74, 23, 302, 1354, 235, 225, 22, 73212, 32, 5044, 5733, 9, 11745, 242, 77, 1235, 71, 1145, 85, 108, 3, 948, 317, 6, 7142, 14648, 250, 11424, 640, 366, 8, 147, 1, 12, 2, 198, 6, 23726, 1891, 6, 40, 515, 4, 3, 1533, 1, 3, 7, 112, 12, 137, 125, 16, 77, 1766, 594, 6, 7142, 500, 24, 127, 76, 2150, 20302, 6179, 125, 16, 8, 2893, 252, 35, 101, 43, 1, 1762, 930, 15, 234, 234, 915, 5, 12, 1166, 235, 141, 310]",1673.0,29992535,142
Generation of sphingosine-1-phosphate is enhanced in biliary tract cancer patients and is associated with lymphatic metastasis.,Scientific reports,Sci Rep,2018-07-17,"Lymphatic metastasis is known to contribute to worse prognosis of biliary tract cancer (BTC). Recently, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid mediator generated by sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1), has been shown to play an important role in lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis in several types of cancer. However, the role of the lipid mediator in BTC has never been examined. Here we found that S1P is elevated in BTC with the activation of ceramide-synthetic pathways, suggesting that BTC utilizes SPHK1 to promote lymphatic metastasis. We found that S1P, sphingosine and ceramide precursors such as monohexosyl-ceramide and sphingomyelin, but not ceramide, were significantly increased in BTC compared to normal biliary tract tissue using LC-ESI-MS/MS. Utilizing The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort, we demonstrated that S1P in BTC is generated via de novo pathway and exported via ABCC1. Further, we found that SPHK1 expression positively correlated with factors related to lymphatic metastasis in BTC. Finally, immunohistochemical examination revealed that gallbladder cancer with lymph node metastasis had significantly higher expression of phospho-SPHK1 than that without.

Cox regression modeling was used to calculate the concordance index of AJCC 8 in predicting overall survival. N sampling and positivity rates were analyzed over the study period. In our cohort, predicted 5-year overall survival by AJCC 8 was: stage I, 62.5%; II, 50.2%; IIIA, 25.7%; IIIB, 22.1%; IVA, 15.7%; IVB, 6.7% (P < 0.01). The concordance index for the staging system was 0.832. Only 50.7% of the patients had any LN sampling to determine the N stage. LN sampling rates improved from 45.6% in 2004 to 55.1% in 2013 (P < 0.001). However, only 24.5% of patients with any LN sampling had ≥6 LNs resected (12.4% of eligible cohort), with a median LN sample of two. AJCC 8 offers adequate discrimination for GBC staging, especially for node-positive patients. With actual GBC LN sampling rates at 50.7%, and far short of the ≥6 LN threshold, quality improvement measures may need to focus on requiring any LN sampling before raising the minimum to six LNs.",Journal Article,600.0,6.0,For cancer GBC the American Joint Committee on Cancer eighth edition AJCC 8 staging system classifies lymph node LN stage by the number of positive LN and recommends sampling of ≥6 LNs We evaluated the prognostic capability of the AJCC 8 for patients undergoing resection and the current national trends in LN staging in the context of these new recommendations for nodal N sampling Utilizing the National Cancer Data Base we identified all adenocarcinoma patients treated with surgical resection in 2004-2014 Cox regression modeling was used to calculate the concordance index of AJCC 8 in predicting overall survival N sampling and positivity rates were analyzed over the study period In our cohort predicted 5-year overall survival by AJCC 8 was stage I 62.5 II 50.2 IIIA 25.7 IIIB 22.1 IVA 15.7 IVB 6.7 P 0.01 The concordance index for the staging system was 0.832 Only 50.7 of the patients had any LN sampling to determine the N stage LN sampling rates improved from 45.6 in 2004 to 55.1 in 2013 P 0.001 However only 24.5 of patients with any LN sampling had ≥6 LNs resected 12.4 of eligible cohort with a median LN sample of two AJCC 8 offers adequate discrimination for GBC staging especially for node-positive patients With actual GBC LN sampling rates at 50.7 and far short of the ≥6 LN threshold quality improvement measures may need to focus on requiring any LN sampling before raising the minimum to six LNs,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[9, 12, 6344, 3, 597, 2093, 2002, 23, 12, 7732, 3580, 2271, 66, 632, 398, 15295, 263, 289, 1763, 82, 20, 3, 207, 1, 109, 1763, 2, 6716, 2874, 1, 6258, 2704, 21, 194, 3, 177, 6188, 1, 3, 2271, 66, 9, 7, 479, 170, 2, 3, 291, 657, 1963, 4, 1763, 632, 4, 3, 1533, 1, 46, 217, 883, 9, 779, 78, 2874, 2600, 3, 657, 12, 74, 1782, 21, 108, 62, 449, 7, 73, 5, 221, 170, 4, 1131, 1409, 418, 320, 2057, 10, 95, 6, 3232, 3, 1827, 558, 1, 2271, 66, 4, 1434, 63, 25, 78, 2874, 2, 1887, 151, 11, 311, 252, 3, 45, 727, 4, 114, 180, 783, 33, 111, 63, 25, 20, 2271, 66, 10, 82, 70, 744, 33, 215, 212, 18, 3164, 243, 67, 3036, 350, 14, 5900, 167, 67, 7042, 49, 67, 19, 13, 355, 3, 1827, 558, 9, 3, 632, 398, 10, 13, 14742, 158, 212, 67, 1, 3, 7, 42, 500, 1763, 2874, 6, 223, 3, 78, 82, 1763, 2874, 151, 231, 29, 512, 49, 4, 1131, 6, 614, 14, 4, 1346, 19, 13, 144, 137, 158, 259, 33, 1, 7, 5, 500, 1763, 2874, 42, 6258, 2704, 1133, 133, 39, 1, 625, 180, 5, 8, 52, 1763, 1000, 1, 100, 2271, 66, 2339, 1658, 3520, 9, 6344, 632, 1093, 9, 289, 109, 7, 5, 3480, 6344, 1763, 2874, 151, 28, 212, 67, 2, 3272, 978, 1, 3, 6258, 1763, 2390, 372, 767, 1018, 68, 594, 6, 1222, 23, 1888, 500, 1763, 2874, 348, 6627, 3, 2499, 6, 437, 2704]",1419.0,30100032,24

Regional differences in gallbladder cancer pathogenesis: Insights from a multi-institutional comparison of tumor mutations.,Cancer,Cancer,2018-11-14,"Although rare in the United States, gallbladder cancer (GBCA) is a common cause of cancer death in some parts of the world. To investigate regional differences in pathogenesis and outcomes for GBCA, tumor mutations were analyzed from a sampling of specimens. Primary tumors from patients with GBCA who were treated in Chile, Japan, and the United States between 1999 and 2016 underwent targeted sequencing of known cancer-associated genes. Fisher exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests assessed differences in clinicopathologic and genetic factors. Kaplan-Meier methods evaluated differences in overall survival from the time of surgery between mutations. A total of 81 patients were included. Japanese patients (11 patients) were older (median age, 72 years [range, 54-81 years]) compared with patients from Chile (21 patients; median age, 59 years [range, 32-73 years]) and the United States (49 patients; median age, 66 years [range, 46-87 years]) (P = .002) and had more well-differentiated tumors (46% vs 0% for Chile/United States; P < .001) and fewer gallstone-associated cancers (36% vs 67% for Chile and 69% for the United States; P = .13). Japanese patients had a median mutation burden of 6 (range, 1-23) compared with Chile (median mutation burden, 7 [range, 3-20]) and the United States (median mutation burden, 4 [range, 0-27]) (P = .006). Tumors from Japanese patients lacked AT-rich interaction domain 1A (ARID1A) and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) mutations, whereas Chilean tumors lacked Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (ERBB3) and AT-rich interaction domain 2 (ARID2) mutations. SMAD family member 4 (SMAD4) was found to be mutated similarly across centers (38% in Chile, 36% in Japan, and 27% in the United States; P = .68) and was univariately associated with worse overall survival (median, 10 months vs 25 months; P = .039). At least one potentially actionable gene was found to be altered in 80% of tumors.

Staging laparoscopy among three subtypes of extra-hepatic biliary malignancy: a 15-year experience from 10 institutions.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2018-12-26,"Staging laparoscopy (SL) is used to avoid resection failure and thus increase the curative resection rate. SL utilization in extra-hepatic biliary tumors (EHBT) is variable. Data from 1090 patients with potentially resectable EHBT including gallbladder (GBC), distal (DC), and hilar (HC) subtypes were retrospectively collected from 10 academic centers (2000-2015). The SL utilization rate increased over time and was significantly higher in GBC than DC and HC. SL yield was 16.8% and did not differ between groups or over time. In patients undergoing attempted resection with prior SL, the curative resection rate did not differ between subtypes. In patients undergoing attempted resection without prior SL, the curative resection rate was less in GBC compared with DC or HC. After matching cohorts by inverse probability weighting, prior SL was associated with curative resection in GBC only (odds ratio [OR], 2.41, 95% CI, 1.36-4.27). On multivariable regression analysis, elevated carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), low serum albumin, and GBC were strong predictors of distant disease on SL. After categorizing patients undergoing SL into low, intermediate, and high-risk groups based on these parameters, SL yield improved progressively from 10.0% to 19.6% to 52.6%.

We reviewed our hospital database for prognosticating the patients with post-cholecystectomy abdominal wall nodule. On reviewing the database we could find 7 patients who were diagnosed with GBC after simple cholecystectomy. Three of those patients were diagnosed after evaluation of a scar site nodule. Two patients were females and one patient was male. The mean age of the patients was 55 years. Two patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy and one patient underwent open cholecystectomy. The average time of detection of malignancy was 10.6 months. The gallbladder was not subjected to histopathological examination in all three patients. The patients had the unresectable disease on restaging workup. Two patients had adenocarcinoma while one patient had a neuroendocrine tumor. abdominal wall nodule is a rare marker of occult gallbladder carcinoma. Subjecting every gallbladder specimen to histopathology should help in improving the survival in these patients.,Case Reports,354.0,0.0,carcinoma GBC is a rare pathology We reviewed our hospital database for prognosticating the patients with post-cholecystectomy abdominal wall nodule On reviewing the database we could find 7 patients who were diagnosed with GBC after simple cholecystectomy Three of those patients were diagnosed after evaluation of a scar site nodule Two patients were females and one patient was male The mean age of the patients was 55 years Two patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy and one patient underwent open cholecystectomy The average time of detection of malignancy was 10.6 months The was not subjected to histopathological examination in all three patients The patients had the unresectable disease on restaging workup Two patients had adenocarcinoma while one patient had a neuroendocrine tumor abdominal wall nodule is a rare marker of occult carcinoma Subjecting every specimen to histopathology should help in improving the survival in these patients,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[134, 6344, 16, 8, 622, 1117, 21, 446, 114, 702, 609, 9, 22496, 3, 7, 5, 539, 8493, 1467, 2397, 5072, 23, 6979, 3, 609, 21, 359, 2469, 67, 7, 54, 11, 265, 5, 6344, 50, 2763, 8493, 169, 1, 135, 7, 11, 265, 50, 451, 1, 8, 10162, 606, 5072, 100, 7, 11, 2451, 2, 104, 69, 10, 1045, 3, 313, 89, 1, 3, 7, 10, 614, 60, 100, 7, 208, 1964, 8493, 2, 104, 69, 208, 1020, 8493, 3, 1011, 98, 1, 638, 1, 710, 10, 79, 49, 53, 3, 10, 44, 4325, 6, 4370, 1385, 4, 62, 169, 7, 3, 7, 42, 3, 1468, 34, 23, 4275, 4755, 100, 7, 42, 449, 369, 104, 69, 42, 8, 1542, 30, 1467, 2397, 5072, 16, 8, 622, 952, 1, 2879, 134, 39186, 454, 2360, 6, 3831, 257, 987, 4, 1673, 3, 25, 4, 46, 7]",961.0,31032806,42
