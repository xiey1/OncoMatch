Use of the stromal cell-derived factor-1/CXCR4 pathway in prostate cancer metastasis to bone.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2002-03-01,"Neoplasms have a striking tendency to metastasize or ""home"" to bone. Hematopoietic cells also home to bone during embryonic development, where evidence points to the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1 or CXCL12; expressed by osteoblasts and endothelial cells) and its receptor (CXCR4) as key elements in these processes. We hypothesized that metastatic prostate carcinomas also use the SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway to localize to the bone. To test this, levels of CXCR4 expression were determined for several human prostate cancer cell lines by reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting. Positive results were obtained for cell lines derived from malignancies that had spread to bone and marrow. Prostate cancer cells were also observed migrating across bone marrow endothelial cell monolayers in response to SDF-1. In in vitro adhesion assays, pretreatment of the prostate cancer cells with SDF-1 significantly increased their adhesion to osteosarcomas and endothelial cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Invasion of the cancer cell lines through basement membranes was also supported by SDF-1 and inhibited by antibody to CXCR4. Collectively, these results suggest that prostate cancers and perhaps other neoplasms may use the SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway to spread to bone.",Journal Article,6535.0,778.0,Neoplasms have a striking tendency to metastasize or `` home '' to Hematopoietic cells also home to during embryonic development where evidence points to the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 SDF-1 or CXCL12 expressed by osteoblasts and endothelial cells and its receptor CXCR4 as key elements in these processes We hypothesized that metastatic carcinomas also use the SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway to localize to the To test this levels of CXCR4 expression were determined for several human cancer cell lines by reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting Positive results were obtained for cell lines derived from malignancies that had spread to and marrow cancer cells were also observed migrating across marrow endothelial cell monolayers in response to SDF-1 In in vitro adhesion assays pretreatment of the cancer cells with SDF-1 significantly increased their adhesion to osteosarcomas and endothelial cell lines in a dose-dependent manner Invasion of the cancer cell lines through basement membranes was also supported by SDF-1 and inhibited by antibody to CXCR4 Collectively these results suggest that cancers and perhaps other neoplasms may use the SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway to spread to,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1179, 47, 8, 5133, 7135, 6, 5769, 15, 3249, 522, 6, 1007, 37, 120, 3249, 6, 190, 5390, 193, 1257, 241, 862, 6, 3, 3596, 1126, 31, 526, 161, 14, 5524, 14, 15, 5807, 570, 20, 5965, 2, 845, 37, 2, 211, 153, 2318, 22, 825, 2531, 4, 46, 1849, 21, 1237, 17, 113, 826, 120, 119, 3, 5524, 14, 2318, 308, 6, 8031, 6, 3, 6, 412, 26, 148, 1, 2318, 55, 11, 509, 9, 392, 171, 12, 31, 285, 20, 1772, 866, 604, 2, 1521, 3661, 109, 99, 11, 683, 9, 31, 285, 526, 29, 441, 17, 42, 2579, 6, 2, 581, 12, 37, 11, 120, 164, 18162, 716, 581, 845, 31, 18163, 4, 51, 6, 5524, 14, 4, 4, 439, 2128, 1013, 1194, 1, 3, 12, 37, 5, 5524, 14, 97, 101, 136, 2128, 6, 11089, 2, 845, 31, 285, 4, 8, 61, 470, 1708, 578, 1, 3, 12, 31, 285, 298, 14082, 10255, 10, 120, 2708, 20, 5524, 14, 2, 879, 20, 548, 6, 2318, 2535, 46, 99, 309, 17, 163, 2, 4434, 127, 1179, 68, 119, 3, 5524, 14, 2318, 308, 6, 2579, 6]",1189.0,11912162,124

The authors evaluated the activity of the combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 per day for 5 days) and etoposide (100 mg/m2 per day for 5 days) given with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to children with osteosarcoma unresponsive to conventional treatment. Fourteen patients with refractory osteosarcoma were treated with this combination. Twelve patients had been previously treated with a multiagent regimen that included carboplatin, ifosfamide, methotrexate, and doxorubicin. Seven of 11 evaluable patients had a poor histologic response in their primary tumor at the time of definitive surgery (Huvos grade 1 or 2). Sites of relapse included lung, bone, and brain.

Phase II trial of gemcitabine in advanced sarcomas.,Cancer,Cancer,2002-06-01,"Care for patients with advanced sarcomas is mainly palliative. Gemcitabine, a nucleoside antimetabolite, is an analog of deoxycytidine that has shown antitumor activity in several tumors. The aim of the current study was to determine the clinical activity of gemcitabine in patients with sarcomas. The authors evaluated gemcitabine in patients with histologically confirmed sarcomas; one prior exposure to chemotherapy treatment was allowed. Prior radiation was allowed if given to non-indicator lesions. Treatment consisted of gemcitabine 1250 mg/m(2) intravenously over 30 minutes, every week x three, cycles repeated q28 days. Twenty nine of 30 patients were evaluable; one patient refused to initiate study treatment. The mean age was 50 years (range, 22-81 years); 59% were male, and 35% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 (vs. 1 or 2). Patients were histologically classified as leiomyosarcoma (seven gastrointestinal, four retroperitoneal, two inferior vena caval, three of the extremity, and two uterine), synovial (two patients), malignant fibrous histiocytoma (two patients), fibrosarcoma (one patient), osteosarcoma (two patients), liposarcoma (one patient), hemangiosarcoma (one patient), or giant cell (one patient). Patients received an average of two cycles (range, one to eight). Eighty three percent of patients discontinued treatment due to progression and 14% due to toxicity/refusal. Hematologic toxicities >or= Grade 3 were seen in 32% of patients and consisted of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Anorexia (Grade 1/2 in 6 patients, Grade 3 in 1 patient), nausea (Grade 1/2 in 7 patients, Grade 3 in 1 patient), and lethargy (Grade 1/2 in 19 patients) were the most frequently observed nonhematologic toxicities. One patient experienced Grade 3 edema and muscle infarction. A different patient experienced unexplained Grade 3 chest pain. One partial response was observed in a uterine leiomyosarcoma patient lasting at least three months. Overall response rate was 3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0-15). Median time -to progression was 2.1 months (95% CI: 1.8-3.0).

"Osteosarcoma cells, resistant to methotrexate due to nucleoside and nucleobase salvage, are sensitive to nucleoside analogs.",Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol.,2002-06-14,"To test a novel strategy for overcoming intrinsic resistance to methotrexate (MTX) in osteosarcoma (OS) due to nucleoside and nucleobase salvage (NS). Four OS cell lines, found to be highly resistant to MTX, were tested to determine the dominant mechanism of resistance. Sensitivity to MTX was tested in the presence of dialyzed serum or the transport inhibitor dipyridamole (DP) to confirm the contribution of NS to MTX resistance. We then investigated whether increased NS activity could be exploited using cytotoxic nucleoside analogs. Like other cell types, OS cells are capable of circumventing inhibition of de novo nucleotide synthesis by relying on NS. MTX, at concentrations as high as 1 m M did not inhibit cell growth in culture medium supplemented with undialyzed serum. In contrast, when NS was inhibited by DP or in medium depleted of nucleosides and nucleobases, sensitivity to MTX was seen at nanomolar concentrations. In medium with dialyzed serum, thymidine and hypoxanthine provided dose-dependent protection from MTX toxicity at concentrations similar to those seen in human plasma. No evidence of other significant mechanisms of resistance were found. All four cell lines were sensitive to 3-day exposures to cytarabine (IC50 0.22 to 2.88 micro M) and vidarabine (IC50 0.09 to 0.95 micro M). Salvage of de novo nucleotide synthesis inhibition by extracellular thymidine and hypoxanthine, at physiologically relevant concentrations, contributes to resistance to MTX in OS. However, this same process may impart a collateral sensitivity to nucleoside analogs.

Second malignant neoplasms in long-term survivors of osteosarcoma: Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Experience.,Cancer,Cancer,2002-10-01,"The authors investigated the incidence and relative risk of secondary malignant neoplasms in long-term survivors of osteosarcoma. A comprehensive list of 509 patients with primary osteosarcoma treated at our institution between February 1973 and March 2000 was identified. All study patients received chemotherapy and/or surgery on one of six different protocols (T4, 5, 7, 10, 12, and CCG-7921/POG-9351). Chemotherapy was scheduled for up to 40 weeks with some variations in the actual treatment period and consisted of various combinations of the following agents: high-dose methotrexate, doxorubicin, bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, dactinomycin, vincristine, cisplatin, and ifosfamide. Secondary malignant neoplasms (SMN) occurred in 14 of 509 patients. Only one had pulmonary metastasis at diagnosis and subsequent multiple recurrences that required thoracotomies and further modification of the chemotherapy regimen. The median age at diagnosis for osteosarcoma was 16.6 years (range, 3.1-74.4 years). The median follow-up was 5.2 years (range, 0.1-25.0 years). The time interval from diagnosis of the primary osteosarcoma to the development of SMN was 1.3-13.1 years (median, 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6-9.6). The most common SMN occurred in the central nervous system (n = 4): anaplastic glioma, meningioma, high-grade glioma, and maxillary astrocytoma. There were two cases of acute myeloid leukemia and one case each of myelodysplastic syndrome, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, breast carcinoma, and mucoepidermoid carcinoma. The overall 5 and 10-year cumulative incidences of SMNs were 1.4% +/- 1.1% and 3.1% +/- 1.8%. The standardized incidence ratio was 4.6 (95% CI, 2.53-7.78, P = 0.00001) for the cohort and 3.64 (95% CI, 1.82-6.52, P = 0.0007) when patients with a history of retinoblastoma or Rothmund-Thomson syndrome were excluded. The overall incidence of secondary malignancies in long-term survivors of osteosarcoma was significantly higher than the expected incidence of cancer in the general population.

WT1-p53 interactions in insulin-like growth factor-I receptor gene regulation.,The Journal of biological chemistry,J. Biol. Chem.,2002-11-19,"The insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) plays a critical role in transformation. The expression of the IGF-IR gene is negatively regulated by a number of transcription factors, including the WT1 and p53 tumor suppressors. Previous studies have suggested both physical and functional interactions between the WT1 and p53 proteins. The potential functional interactions between WT1 and p53 in control of IGF-IR promoter activity were addressed by transient coexpression of vectors encoding different isoforms of WT1, together with IGF-IR promoter-luciferase reporter constructs, in p53-null osteosarcoma-derived Saos-2 cells, wild-type p53-expressing kidney tumor-derived G401 cells, and mutant p53-expressing, rhabdomyosarcoma-derived RD cells. Similar studies were also performed to compare p53-expressing Balb/c-3T3 and clonally derived p53-null, (10)1 fibroblasts and the colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 +/+, which expresses a wild-type p53 gene, and its HCT116 -/- derivative, in which the p53 gene has been disrupted by homologous recombination. WT1 splice variants lacking a KTS insert between zinc fingers 3 and 4 suppressed IGF-IR promoter activity in the absence of p53 or in the presence of wild-type p53. WT1 variants that contain the KTS insert are impaired in their ability to bind to the IGF-IR promoter and are unable to suppress IGF-IR promoter. In the presence of mutant p53, WT1 cannot repress the IGF-IR promoter. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that p53 and WT1 physically interact, whereas electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies revealed that p53 modulates the ability of WT1 to bind to the IGF-IR promoter. In summary, the transcriptional activity of WT1 proteins and their ability to function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes depends on the cellular status of p53.",Journal Article,6272.0,61.0,The insulin-like growth factor-I receptor IGF-IR plays a critical role in transformation The expression of the IGF-IR gene is negatively regulated by a number of transcription factors including the WT1 and p53 tumor suppressors Previous studies have suggested both physical and functional interactions between the WT1 and p53 proteins The potential functional interactions between WT1 and p53 in control of IGF-IR promoter activity were addressed by transient coexpression of vectors encoding different isoforms of WT1 together with IGF-IR promoter-luciferase reporter constructs in p53-null osteosarcoma-derived Saos-2 cells wild-type p53-expressing tumor-derived G401 cells and mutant p53-expressing rhabdomyosarcoma-derived RD cells Similar studies were also performed to compare p53-expressing Balb/c-3T3 and clonally derived p53-null 10 1 fibroblasts and the cancer cell line HCT116 +/+ which expresses a wild-type p53 gene and its HCT116 -/- derivative in which the p53 gene has been disrupted by homologous recombination WT1 splice variants lacking a KTS insert between zinc fingers 3 and 4 suppressed IGF-IR promoter activity in the absence of p53 or in the presence of wild-type p53 WT1 variants that contain the KTS insert are impaired in their ability to bind to the IGF-IR promoter and are unable to suppress IGF-IR promoter In the presence of mutant p53 WT1 can not repress the IGF-IR promoter Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that p53 and WT1 physically interact whereas electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies revealed that p53 modulates the ability of WT1 to bind to the IGF-IR promoter In summary the transcriptional activity of WT1 proteins and their ability to function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes depends on the cellular status of p53,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1601, 733, 129, 161, 70, 153, 1273, 2123, 1698, 8, 740, 200, 4, 1392, 3, 55, 1, 3, 1273, 2123, 145, 16, 2723, 1065, 20, 8, 207, 1, 866, 130, 141, 3, 3722, 2, 624, 30, 5704, 698, 94, 47, 1148, 110, 900, 2, 583, 1286, 59, 3, 3722, 2, 624, 652, 3, 174, 583, 1286, 59, 3722, 2, 624, 4, 182, 1, 1273, 2123, 973, 128, 11, 2814, 20, 2473, 7588, 1, 5453, 2362, 338, 3913, 1, 3722, 1162, 5, 1273, 2123, 973, 3864, 3674, 5500, 4, 624, 3505, 37324, 526, 33328, 18, 37, 955, 267, 624, 1046, 30, 526, 53237, 37, 2, 620, 624, 1046, 22050, 526, 3089, 37, 288, 94, 11, 120, 173, 6, 932, 624, 1046, 8166, 256, 14796, 2, 9157, 526, 624, 3505, 79, 14, 3921, 2, 3, 12, 31, 328, 4522, 92, 8293, 8, 955, 267, 624, 145, 2, 211, 4522, 4819, 4, 92, 3, 624, 145, 71, 85, 5576, 20, 3894, 4017, 3722, 4371, 839, 1941, 8, 27984, 14797, 59, 5988, 30338, 27, 2, 39, 1908, 1273, 2123, 973, 128, 4, 3, 1127, 1, 624, 15, 4, 3, 463, 1, 955, 267, 624, 3722, 839, 17, 3725, 3, 27984, 14797, 32, 2364, 4, 136, 801, 6, 4060, 6, 3, 1273, 2123, 973, 2, 32, 4253, 6, 3134, 1273, 2123, 973, 4, 3, 463, 1, 620, 624, 3722, 122, 44, 11385, 3, 1273, 2123, 973, 15888, 2332, 224, 17, 624, 2, 3722, 7263, 4491, 547, 10980, 5717, 3024, 719, 94, 553, 17, 624, 5259, 3, 801, 1, 3722, 6, 4060, 6, 3, 1273, 2123, 973, 4, 1962, 3, 1431, 128, 1, 3722, 652, 2, 136, 801, 6, 343, 22, 30, 5704, 15, 3326, 3828, 23, 3, 763, 156, 1, 624]",1773.0,12444079,80
Metachronous skeletal osteosarcoma in patients treated with adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy for nonmetastatic osteosarcoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2003-01-01,"The prognosis for patients who develop metachronous skeletal osteosarcoma (OS) has been considered grave compared with that for patients with relapse limited to the lungs. We investigated the incidence and outcome of metachronous skeletal OS after initial treatment of the primary tumor. Twenty-three (median age 18.7 years) of 426 patients with nonmetastatic, high-grade primary OS treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY) between February 1973 and May 2000 developed metachronous skeletal OS. Initial therapy included combination chemotherapy and surgery. Treatment of subsequent relapses consisted of chemotherapy or radiation alone or surgery with or without additional individualized chemotherapy. The median time from the diagnosis of primary OS to the development of metachronous OS was 1.4 years (range, 0.2 to 11.3 years). Median survival was 1.5 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8 to 6.9 years). Two- and 5-year postmetachronous overall survival was 43.5% (95% CI, 23.2% to 63.7%) and 33% (95% CI, 13% to 53%), respectively. At last follow-up (range, 0.1 to 12.8 years), five (30.4%) patients were alive with no evidence of disease (range, 1.7 to 12.8 years; median, 4.4 years). For 11 patients who developed metachronous OS 24 months or more from initial diagnosis, 5-year postmetachronous survival rate for patients receiving combined modality versus monotherapy was 83% (95% CI, 54% to 100%) and 40% (95% CI, 0% to 83%), respectively. In a small subset of patients who developed late metachronous OS, combined-modality therapy with surgery and aggressive chemotherapy may result in long-term postmetachronous survival.

Sequence alterations in the reduced folate carrier are observed in osteosarcoma tumor samples.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2003-02-01,"High-dose methotrexate is a standard component of therapy for high-grade osteosarcoma. Its effectiveness may be limited by intrinsic and acquired resistance. Decreased reduced folate carrier (RFC) expression has been shown in approximately half of osteosarcomas at diagnosis. Mutations and polymorphisms in the RFC gene have been reported in various cell lines. The purpose of this study was to investigate sequence alterations in the RFC gene in osteosarcoma tumor samples. The entire coding region of the RFC gene in samples from 162 osteosarcoma patients was screened by DNA single-stranded conformational polymorphism, followed by direct sequencing of any region with altered mobility. A previously identified polymorphism at cDNA position number 174 of RFC exon 2 was observed. Sixty-one samples (37.6%) were heterozygous with both A/G at this position (His(27)/Arg(27)), 52 samples (32.2%) were homozygous with G (Arg(27)), and 49 samples (30.2%) were homozygous with A (His(27)). Fifteen (9.2%) samples were identified with other RFC sequence variants in exon 2, none of which have been reported. The sequence variants in exon 2 included a G to A substitution at cDNA position 231, a G to A substitution at cDNA position 155, a C to T substitution at cDNA position 114, and a T to C substitution at cDNA position 104, resulting in a serine to asparagine substitution at amino acid 46, a glutamate to lysine substitution at amino acid 21, an alanine to valine substitution at amino acid 7, and a serine to proline substitution at amino acid 4, respectively. A deletion of A at cDNA position 126 resulting in a frameshift was also observed. Some of these variants were observed in multiple samples. Eight samples had altered single-stranded conformational polymorphism patterns in exon 3 that were associated with nucleotide changes that altered the amino acid sequence. All of these RFC sequence variants appeared to be heterozygous. Heterozygous C/T and homozygous C also were observed at RFC cDNA position 790 in exon 3, which does not alter the amino acid coding sequence.

Loss of imprinting of IGF2 and H19 in osteosarcoma is accompanied by reciprocal methylation changes of a CTCF-binding site.,Human molecular genetics,Hum. Mol. Genet.,2003-03-01,"The adjacent insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and H19 genes are imprinted in most normal human tissues, but imprinting is often lost in tumors. The mechanisms involved in maintenance of imprinting (MOI) and loss of imprinting (LOI) are unresolved. We show here that osteosarcoma (OS) tumors with IGF2/H19 MOI exhibit allele-specific differential methylation of a CTCF-binding site upstream of H19. LOI of IGF2 or H19 in OS occurs in a mutually exclusive manner, and occurs with monoallelic expression of the other gene. Bisulfite sequencing reveals IGF2 LOI occurs with biallelic CpG methylation of the CTCF-binding site, while H19 LOI occurs with biallelic hypomethylation of this site. Our data demonstrate that IGF2 LOI and H19 LOI are accompanied by reciprocal methylation changes at a critical CTCF-binding site.

Absence of a telomere maintenance mechanism as a favorable prognostic factor in patients with osteosarcoma.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2003-04-01,"There are two telomere maintenance mechanisms (TMMs) in human tumors, telomerase activation (TA) and, more rarely, the process termed alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Unlike most carcinomas, sarcomas, including osteosarcomas (OS), have been reported to display TA and ALT in more balanced proportions and, thus, present an opportunity to examine the impact of different TMMs on clinical tumor behavior. We studied OS samples from 62 patients for molecular evidence of TA and ALT. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that the absence of both TA and ALT (in 18%) was more strongly associated with improved survival (P = 0.05) than were stage (P = 0.16) or chemotherapy response (P = 0.18) in this group of patients with OS. Subsets of OS cases with either TA or ALT did not differ significantly from each other in clinical outcome. There were no significant associations of presence, absence, or type of TMM with patient age, stage, or chemotherapy response. Thus, the absence of a detectable TMM may identify a favorable clinical subset of OS patients. Our study also suggests that the likelihood of detecting correlations between TMMs and clinical outcome in studies of certain other tumor types might be improved if, in addition to TA, ALT is included in future analyses.

"mRNA expression levels of E2F transcription factors correlate with dihydrofolate reductase, reduced folate carrier, and thymidylate synthase mRNA expression in osteosarcoma.",Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2003-06-01,"Previous studies have shown that decreased expression of the reduced folate carrier (RFC) and increased expression of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) are associated with intrinsic and acquired methotrexate resistance, respectively, in osteosarcoma (OS). It has also been shown in colorectal cancer that E2F-1 expression correlates with thymidylate synthase (TS) and, to a lesser extent, DHFR expression. To begin to investigate the regulation of DHFR and RFC expression in OS samples, mRNA expression of E2F-1 and E2F-4 were measured in OS tumor samples and related to DHFR, RFC, and TS mRNA expression. Using fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR, 112 human OS patient samples were investigated for potential E2F-1/E2F-4:DHFR, E2F-1/E2F-4:RFC, and E2F-1/E2F-4:TS correlations. The expression ranges for each gene are as follows: DHFR, 0.02-33.13 (median = 0.20); RFC, 0.02-229.13 (median = 1.91); TS, 0.01-9.99 (median = 0.15); E2F-1, 0.05-69.07 (median = 0.52); and E2F-4, 0.24-52.35 (median = 1.45). Spearman correlation coefficients (r(s)) for E2F-1:DHFR, E2F-1:RFC, E2F-1:TS, E2F-4:DHFR, E2F-4:RFC, and E2F-4:TS were calculated to be 0.53, 0.63, 0.60, 0.41, 0.58, and 0.33, respectively (P < 0.001). On the basis of this data, moderate correlations exist between E2F-1/E2F-4 and DHFR, RFC, and TS. These results suggest E2F-1/E2F-4 may play a role in the regulation of RFC expression, which has not been reported previously. The E2F transcription factors are also related to DHFR and TS expression in OS samples, suggesting a possible involvement in methotrexate resistance. Although E2F mRNA levels correlate with DHFR, RFC, and TS mRNA expression, additional experiments are necessary to determine the direct effects of these transcription factors and identify other proteins that may influence this relationship.",Journal Article,6078.0,46.0,Previous studies have shown that decreased expression of the reduced folate carrier RFC and increased expression of dihydrofolate reductase DHFR are associated with intrinsic and acquired methotrexate resistance respectively in OS It has also been shown in cancer that E2F-1 expression correlates with thymidylate synthase TS and to a lesser extent DHFR expression To begin to investigate the regulation of DHFR and RFC expression in OS samples mRNA expression of E2F-1 and E2F-4 were measured in OS tumor samples and related to DHFR RFC and TS mRNA expression Using fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR 112 human OS patient samples were investigated for potential E2F-1/E2F-4 DHFR E2F-1/E2F-4 RFC and E2F-1/E2F-4 TS correlations The expression ranges for each gene are as follows DHFR 0.02-33.13 median 0.20 RFC 0.02-229.13 median 1.91 TS 0.01-9.99 median 0.15 E2F-1 0.05-69.07 median 0.52 and E2F-4 0.24-52.35 median 1.45 Spearman correlation coefficients r s for E2F-1 DHFR E2F-1 RFC E2F-1 TS E2F-4 DHFR E2F-4 RFC and E2F-4 TS were calculated to be 0.53 0.63 0.60 0.41 0.58 and 0.33 respectively P 0.001 On the basis of this data moderate correlations exist between E2F-1/E2F-4 and DHFR RFC and TS These results suggest E2F-1/E2F-4 may play a role in the regulation of RFC expression which has not been reported previously The E2F transcription factors are also related to DHFR and TS expression in OS samples suggesting a possible involvement in methotrexate resistance Although E2F mRNA levels correlate with DHFR RFC and TS mRNA expression additional experiments are necessary to determine the direct effects of these transcription factors and identify other proteins that may influence this relationship,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[698, 94, 47, 443, 17, 340, 55, 1, 3, 405, 3100, 4715, 9270, 2, 101, 55, 1, 20298, 4027, 13055, 32, 41, 5, 2354, 2, 1294, 2116, 251, 106, 4, 118, 192, 71, 120, 85, 443, 4, 12, 17, 5391, 14, 55, 1871, 5, 6205, 3522, 3527, 2, 6, 8, 5191, 1039, 13055, 55, 6, 6886, 6, 963, 3, 863, 1, 13055, 2, 9270, 55, 4, 118, 347, 956, 55, 1, 5391, 14, 2, 5391, 39, 11, 644, 4, 118, 30, 347, 2, 139, 6, 13055, 9270, 2, 3527, 956, 55, 75, 2910, 1156, 1589, 98, 604, 3726, 171, 118, 69, 347, 11, 565, 9, 174, 5391, 14, 5391, 39, 13055, 5391, 14, 5391, 39, 9270, 2, 5391, 14, 5391, 39, 3527, 2553, 3, 55, 5632, 9, 296, 145, 32, 22, 2962, 13055, 13, 588, 466, 233, 52, 13, 179, 9270, 13, 588, 7584, 233, 52, 14, 970, 3527, 13, 355, 83, 1058, 52, 13, 167, 5391, 14, 13, 474, 790, 1615, 52, 13, 653, 2, 5391, 39, 13, 259, 653, 465, 52, 14, 512, 5061, 816, 5161, 668, 695, 9, 5391, 14, 13055, 5391, 14, 9270, 5391, 14, 3527, 5391, 39, 13055, 5391, 39, 9270, 2, 5391, 39, 3527, 11, 981, 6, 40, 13, 699, 13, 676, 13, 335, 13, 605, 13, 717, 2, 13, 466, 106, 19, 13, 144, 23, 3, 877, 1, 26, 74, 1163, 2553, 1923, 59, 5391, 14, 5391, 39, 2, 13055, 9270, 2, 3527, 46, 99, 309, 5391, 14, 5391, 39, 68, 1343, 8, 200, 4, 3, 863, 1, 9270, 55, 92, 71, 44, 85, 210, 373, 3, 5391, 866, 130, 32, 120, 139, 6, 13055, 2, 3527, 55, 4, 118, 347, 802, 8, 899, 799, 4, 2116, 251, 242, 5391, 956, 148, 1513, 5, 13055, 9270, 2, 3527, 956, 55, 402, 2332, 32, 1493, 6, 223, 3, 1196, 176, 1, 46, 866, 130, 2, 255, 127, 652, 17, 68, 1054, 26, 858]",1712.0,12813132,5
Phase II study of ecteinascidin 743 in heavily pretreated patients with recurrent osteosarcoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2003-08-01,"Recurrent osteosarcoma is a drug-resistant disease with a dismal prognosis. The objective of this Phase II study was to evaluate the activity of ecteinascidin 743 (ET-743) as a salvage therapy in these patients. Patients with recurrent osteosarcoma who had received standard chemotherapeutic agents were eligible. ET-743 was administered at a dose of 1500 microg/m(2) as a 24-hour infusion every 3 weeks. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed during the first cycle. Twenty-five patients were enrolled, 23 of whom were assessable for response (median age of 18 years; range, 12-67 years). The median number of previous chemotherapeutic agents was five (range, three to eight previous agents). Sixty-one cycles were administered (median number of cycles per patient was 2; range, 1-9 cycles per patient). Three patients (12%) achieved minor responses (49% 36% and 25%, respectively). Fifteen patients (60%) developed a transient elevation of hepatic transaminases (Grade 3 or 4 [according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria]), which was not cumulative. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 12 patients (48%) and 6 patients (24%), respectively. The mean area under the curve (AUC) in 4 patients experiencing Grade 4 toxicity (76.4 +/- 29.3 ng x hr/mL) was significantly greater (P = 0.034) than that in those for whom the most severe toxicity was Grade 3 (39.5 +/- 17.2 ng x hr/mL [n = 12]) or Grade 1-2 (52.6 +/- 15.6 ng x hr/mL [n = 5]). There were no other significant correlations found between pharmacokinetic variables and patient characteristics, toxicity, or therapeutic response. ET-743 was found to be well tolerated in heavily pretreated osteosarcoma patients but had limited antitumor activity as a single agent.

The presence of p53 mutations in human osteosarcomas correlates with high levels of genomic instability.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2003-09-12,"The p53 gene is a critical tumor suppressor that is inactivated in a majority of cancers. The central role of p53 in response to stresses such as DNA damage, hypoxia, and oncogene activation underlies this high frequency of negative selection during tumorigenic transformation. Mutations in p53 disrupt checkpoint responses to DNA damage and result in the potential for destabilization of the genome. Consistent with this, p53 mutant cells have been shown to accumulate genomic alterations in cell culture, mouse models, and some human tumors. The relationship between p53 mutation and genomic instability in human osteosarcoma is addressed in this report. Similar to some other primary human tumors, the mutation of p53 correlates significantly with the presence of high levels of genomic instability in osteosarcomas. Surprisingly, osteosarcomas harboring an amplification of the HDM2 oncogene, which inhibits the tumor-suppressive properties of p53, do not display high levels of genomic instability. These results demonstrate that the inactivation of p53 in osteosarcomas directly by mutation versus indirectly by HDM2 amplification may have different cellular consequences with respect to the stability of the genome.",Journal Article,5975.0,127.0,The p53 gene is a critical tumor suppressor that is inactivated in a majority of cancers The central role of p53 in response to stresses such as DNA damage hypoxia and oncogene activation underlies this high frequency of negative selection during tumorigenic transformation Mutations in p53 disrupt checkpoint responses to DNA damage and result in the potential for destabilization of the genome Consistent with this p53 mutant cells have been shown to accumulate genomic alterations in cell culture mouse models and some human tumors The relationship between p53 mutation and genomic instability in human is addressed in this report Similar to some other primary human tumors the mutation of p53 correlates significantly with the presence of high levels of genomic instability in osteosarcomas Surprisingly osteosarcomas harboring an amplification of the HDM2 oncogene which inhibits the tumor-suppressive properties of p53 do not display high levels of genomic instability These results demonstrate that the inactivation of p53 in osteosarcomas directly by mutation versus indirectly by HDM2 amplification may have different cellular consequences with respect to the stability of the genome,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 624, 145, 16, 8, 740, 30, 1245, 17, 16, 5458, 4, 8, 686, 1, 163, 3, 854, 200, 1, 624, 4, 51, 6, 11804, 225, 22, 261, 1350, 1823, 2, 1836, 363, 10702, 26, 64, 675, 1, 199, 881, 190, 3795, 1392, 138, 4, 624, 6619, 986, 253, 6, 261, 1350, 2, 757, 4, 3, 174, 9, 19459, 1, 3, 898, 925, 5, 26, 624, 620, 37, 47, 85, 443, 6, 7859, 572, 593, 4, 31, 2099, 830, 274, 2, 476, 171, 57, 3, 858, 59, 624, 258, 2, 572, 1753, 4, 171, 16, 2814, 4, 26, 414, 288, 6, 476, 127, 86, 171, 57, 3, 258, 1, 624, 1871, 97, 5, 3, 463, 1, 64, 148, 1, 572, 1753, 4, 11089, 5819, 11089, 2105, 35, 1073, 1, 3, 11466, 1836, 92, 1576, 3, 30, 3707, 1571, 1, 624, 1022, 44, 3640, 64, 148, 1, 572, 1753, 46, 99, 608, 17, 3, 2297, 1, 624, 4, 11089, 1606, 20, 258, 185, 7792, 20, 11466, 1073, 68, 47, 338, 763, 3255, 5, 2184, 6, 3, 2769, 1, 3, 898]",1192.0,12972634,48
Advances in neoadjuvant chemotherapy in soft tissue sarcomas.,Current treatment options in oncology,Curr Treat Options Oncol,2003-12-01,"The use of adjuvant chemotherapy in soft tissue sarcomas (STS) continues to be an area of controversy; however, the group of investigators favoring the use of an anthracycline- and ifosfamide-based regimen for high-risk (American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III) extremity STS is steadily increasing. The historic 5-year survival rate of approximately 50% in this high-risk group treated with local therapy alone represents a poor standard of care, thus there is a need to incorporate systemic therapy early in the management of these patients. Published data from the meta-analysis of doxorubicin-based adjuvant chemotherapy trials and the prospective randomized data with epirubicin and ifosfamide from the Italian Sarcoma Group are frequently used as rationale for this approach. In a rare and heterogenous group of diseases, such as STS, physicians run into negative studies for various reasons that have little to do with the efficacy of the treatment being tested. The wisdom may be in capitalizing further on a positive lead as opposed to nihilism. It is appropriate to acknowledge that the chemotherapeutic agents have limited efficacy and are toxic, especially when used at full therapeutic doses.

The authors reviewed the clinical features, therapy, and outcome for 59 patients from the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) and Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center (Seattle, WA). They were diagnosed initially with OS between January 1990 and December 2000, received multiagent chemotherapy (most frequently cisplatin, doxorubicin, high-dose methotrexate, and ifosfamide), and developed disease recurrence after achieving an initial complete response (CR). The most common site of initial disease recurrence was the lung only (n = 36 patients), followed by distant bone (n =8 patients), combined lung and other sites (n =7 patients), and other sites (n =8 patients). The median time to first disease recurrence was 15 months (range, 2-92 months) from the initial diagnosis. Thirty patients with isolated pulmonary recurrence achieved a second CR, either with surgery alone (n =15 patients) or surgery and salvage chemotherapy (n =15 patients). For this group, the 4-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival rates were 7% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0-16%) and 28% (95% CI, 11-45%), respectively. For all 59 patients with recurrent OS, the 4-year DFS and overall survival rates were 6% (95% CI, 0-12%) and 23% (95% CI, 10-36%), respectively. The only factors associated with improved DFS and overall survival rates were unilateral pulmonary recurrence, solitary pulmonary nodule at recurrence, more than 24 months between the initial diagnosis and first disease recurrence, and achievement of a second CR.

Expression of LDL receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) as a novel marker for disease progression in high-grade osteosarcoma.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2004-03-01,"The Wingless-type (Wnt) family of proteins and its coreceptor LRP5 have recently been implicated in human skeletal development. Wnt pathway modulates cell fate and cell proliferation during embryonic development and carcinogenesis through activation of receptor-mediated signaling. Osteosarcoma (OS) is a bone-forming tumor of mesenchymal origin whose growth control has been linked to autocrine or paracrine stimulation by several growth factor families. We examined 4 OS cell lines for WNT1, WNT4, WNT5A, WNT7A, WNT11, FZD1-10 and LRP5 expression by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition, RT-PCR for LRP5 expression was performed in 44 OS patient samples and the findings were correlated with clinical data. Expression profiling of Wnts and their receptors revealed the presence of several isoforms in OS cell lines. Overall, 22/44 (50%) of OS patient samples showed evidence of LRP5 expression. Presence of LRP5 correlated significantly with tumor metastasis (p = 0.005) and the chondroblastic subtype of OS (p = 0.045). In addition, patients whose tumors were positive for LRP5 showed a trend toward decreased event-free survival (p = 0.066). No significant association was found between LRP5 expression and age, gender, site of disease, site of metastasis or degree of chemotherapy-induced tumor necrosis. Sequencing of exon 3 of LRP5 in 10 OS patient-derived cell cultures showed no activating mutation of LRP5.

Of the 25 patients who relapsed on the earlier protocols, 76% relapsed to the lungs, 8% had local recurrences, and 16% distant metastases to the bone. The median time to first relapse was 12 months. Of the 69 patients who relapsed on the T10 and T12 protocols, 75% relapsed in the lungs, 9% had local recurrences, and 16% distant bone metastases. The median time to first relapse was 17 months. There was no statistically significant difference in the timing of relapse between the two groups studied, although a longer median time to relapse was observed for patients treated on the later protocols. The range of time to relapse was also wider in the later protocols. These data do not support the hypothesis that patterns of relapse are changing with alterations in osteosarcoma treatment.

Reduced folate carrier mutations are not the mechanism underlying methotrexate resistance in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2004-02-01,"Although the majority of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are cured with combination chemotherapy containing methotrexate (MTX), drug resistance contributes to treatment failure for a substantial fraction of patients. The primary transporter for folates and MTX is the reduced folate carrier (RFC). Impaired drug transport is a documented mechanism of MTX resistance in patients with ALL; however, to the authors' knowledge it is not known whether inactivating RFC mutations are a contributing factor. The authors devised a genomic polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism assay followed by sequencing and screened the entire RFC coding region for sequence alterations in DNA from 246 leukemia specimens from patients with diverse ethnic variation, 24 at the time of recurrence and the rest at the time of diagnosis. This cohort was comprised of 203 B-precursor ALL specimens (82.5%), 32 T-lineage ALL specimens (13%), and 11 acute myeloblastic leukemia specimens (4.5%). Of 246 DNA samples, only 3 diagnosis B-precursor ALL specimens (1.2%) were found to harbor alterations in the RFC gene, including heterozygous single nucleotide changes resulting in D56H and D522N substitutions in the first extracellular loop and the C-terminus of this transporter, respectively. The third sample had a sequence alteration in exon 3 that could not be identified because of the lack of availability of DNA. Whereas inactivating RFC mutations are a frequent mechanism of MTX resistance in human leukemia cell lines and in patients with osteosarcoma, they are not common and do not appear to play any significant role in intrinsic or acquired resistance to MTX in childhood leukemia. This is the first study of RFC mutations in multiple pediatric leukemia specimens.",Journal Article,5833.0,36.0,Although the majority of children with acute lymphoblastic ALL are cured with combination chemotherapy containing methotrexate MTX drug resistance contributes to treatment failure for a substantial fraction of patients The primary transporter for folates and MTX is the reduced folate carrier RFC Impaired drug transport is a documented mechanism of MTX resistance in patients with ALL however to the authors knowledge it is not known whether inactivating RFC mutations are a contributing factor The authors devised a genomic polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism assay followed by sequencing and screened the entire RFC coding region for sequence alterations in DNA from 246 specimens from patients with diverse ethnic variation 24 at the time of recurrence and the rest at the time of diagnosis This cohort was comprised of 203 B-precursor ALL specimens 82.5 32 T-lineage ALL specimens 13 and 11 acute myeloblastic specimens 4.5 Of 246 DNA samples only 3 diagnosis B-precursor ALL specimens 1.2 were found to harbor alterations in the RFC gene including heterozygous single nucleotide changes resulting in D56H and D522N substitutions in the first extracellular loop and the C-terminus of this transporter respectively The third sample had a sequence alteration in exon 3 that could not be identified because of the lack of availability of DNA Whereas inactivating RFC mutations are a frequent mechanism of MTX resistance in human cell lines and in patients with they are not common and do not appear to play any significant role in intrinsic or acquired resistance to MTX in childhood This is the first study of RFC mutations in multiple pediatric specimens,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[242, 3, 686, 1, 541, 5, 286, 1275, 62, 32, 3733, 5, 150, 56, 1101, 2116, 3453, 234, 251, 2444, 6, 24, 496, 9, 8, 1281, 1509, 1, 7, 3, 86, 5246, 9, 28084, 2, 3453, 16, 3, 405, 3100, 4715, 9270, 2364, 234, 4294, 16, 8, 1405, 670, 1, 3453, 251, 4, 7, 5, 62, 137, 6, 3, 738, 922, 192, 16, 44, 440, 317, 6096, 9270, 138, 32, 8, 3156, 161, 3, 738, 10085, 8, 572, 1451, 1260, 1329, 226, 4787, 9011, 1907, 719, 370, 20, 615, 2, 2261, 3, 1797, 9270, 3097, 1053, 9, 1532, 593, 4, 261, 29, 6907, 623, 29, 7, 5, 1867, 2871, 1380, 259, 28, 3, 98, 1, 146, 2, 3, 3677, 28, 3, 98, 1, 147, 26, 180, 10, 2603, 1, 5426, 132, 2765, 62, 623, 878, 33, 531, 102, 2542, 62, 623, 233, 2, 175, 286, 21049, 623, 39, 33, 1, 6907, 261, 347, 158, 27, 147, 132, 2765, 62, 623, 14, 18, 11, 204, 6, 2760, 593, 4, 3, 9270, 145, 141, 4167, 226, 1579, 400, 1113, 4, 54005, 2, 54006, 7646, 4, 3, 157, 1976, 4432, 2, 3, 256, 9114, 1, 26, 5246, 106, 3, 1282, 1000, 42, 8, 1532, 2611, 4, 1725, 27, 17, 359, 44, 40, 108, 408, 1, 3, 926, 1, 2550, 1, 261, 547, 6096, 9270, 138, 32, 8, 908, 670, 1, 3453, 251, 4, 171, 31, 285, 2, 4, 7, 5, 491, 32, 44, 186, 2, 1022, 44, 1322, 6, 1343, 500, 93, 200, 4, 2354, 15, 1294, 251, 6, 3453, 4, 864, 26, 16, 3, 157, 45, 1, 9270, 138, 4, 232, 815, 623]",1690.0,14770434,10
Adjuvant therapy of osteosarcoma--A Phase II trial: Southwest Oncology Group study 9139.,Cancer,Cancer,2004-02-01,"The objective of this study was to estimate the time to treatment failure and survival rate of the three-drug combination of doxorubicin, cisplatin, and ifosfamide as primary and postoperative, adjunctive treatment for teenagers and adults with osteosarcoma (OS). Sixty-three eligible patients with nonmetastatic OS of the extremities were registered from 24 institutions from February, 1992 through December, 1996. Chemotherapy was comprised of doxorubicin at a dose of 75 mg/m2 and cisplatin at a dose of 120 mg/m2, alternating with doxorubicin at a dose of 50 mg/m2 and ifosfamide at a dose of 8 g/m2. Four cycles were given prior to surgical resection, and four cycles were given after surgery. Outcome measures included the time to treatment failure, overall survival, toxicity, and centralized assessment of tumor necrosis. Thirty-one of 63 eligible patients died, for a 5-year overall survival rate of 58% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 46-71%). The median time to treatment failure was 19 months (95% CI, 12-41 months). A good pathologic response (> or = 90% necrosis) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was observed in 48% of patients who underwent surgery. There was no correlation noted between response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and patient outcome. Grade 4 hematologic toxicities were frequent (89%), although serious nonhematologic toxicities other than nausea and emesis were uncommon. The regimen and schedule used in the current study did not improve outcomes compared with prior trials of doxorubicin and cisplatin alone. New, more effective drugs are needed for the treatment of patients with OS.

"In vitro and in vivo cytotoxic activities of recombinant immunotoxin 8H9(Fv)-PE38 against breast cancer, osteosarcoma, and neuroblastoma.",Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2004-02-01,"The 8H9 monoclonal antibody (MAb) is highly reactive with a cell surface glycoprotein expressed on human breast cancers, childhood sarcomas, and neuroblastomas but is not reactive with the cell surface of normal human tissues. This specific reactivity suggests that MAb 8H9 may be useful for targeted cancer therapy. To explore this possibility, we generated two recombinant immunotoxins (ITs) using the single-chain Fv (scFv) of MAb 8H9. Initially the 8H9(scFv) cDNA was fused to a DNA encoding a 38-kDa truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE38) to generate the IT 8H9(scFv)-PE38. The fusion gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the IT was purified to near homogeneity from inclusion bodies. The purified IT showed specific cytotoxicity on nine different cancer cell lines derived from breast cancer, osteosarcoma, and neuroblastomas, known to react with MAb 8H9. The cytotoxic activity was inhibited by MAb 8H9, showing the cytotoxic activity is specific. The antitumor activity of 8H9(scFv)-PE38 was evaluated in severe combined immunodeficient mice bearing MCF-7 breast cancers or OHS-M1 osteosarcomas. The IT showed a specific dose-dependent antitumor activity at 0.075 and 0.15 mg/kg. Next, a more stable disulfide-linked IT, 8H9(dsFv)-PE38, was constructed.

Surgical management and outcome of osteosarcoma patients with unilateral pulmonary metastases.,Journal of pediatric surgery,J. Pediatr. Surg.,2004-03-01,"The surgical management of osteosarcoma patients with unilateral pulmonary nodules is controversial. The authors reviewed their institutional experience to evaluate the incidence of occult contralateral metastases. Data were obtained retrospectively on all consecutive osteosarcoma patients from 1980 to 2002. Eighty-four patients with pulmonary nodules were identified. Forty-one had bilateral disease, and 43 had unilateral involvement by computed tomography (CT) scan. All 43 patients with unilateral nodules underwent ipsilateral thoracotomies. Fifteen patients had negative exploration findings, and only 1 had pulmonary relapse. Of the 28 patients with metastases confirmed at initial thoracotomies, 14 had extensive pleural or extrapulmonary disease at initial thoracotomy followed by disease progression. The other 14 are separated into early versus late metastases, using 2 years from diagnosis as the cutoff point. Seven of the 9 (78%) patients with early metastases had or subsequently had contralateral disease; 6 were identified at staged contralateral thoracotomy and 1 had relapsed in the unexplored lung a year later. Only 1 of the 5 patients with late unilateral metastases had relapse in the contralateral side.

High-dose methotrexate pharmacokinetics and outcome of children and young adults with osteosarcoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2004-04-01,"High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) is used frequently in combination regimens that include nephrotoxic chemotherapy. The authors evaluated the impact of factors such as age and prior nephrotoxic agents on MTX pharmacokinetics in children and young adults with osteosarcoma and examined whether MTX pharmacokinetic parameters were associated with outcome. The authors evaluated MTX pharmacokinetics in 140 patients who were treated with 1083 courses of HDMTX on 3 consecutive studies of multiagent chemotherapy at a single institution. The influence of MTX pharmacokinetics on the outcome of 107 patients with localized disease was examined. Mean peak MTX concentrations > or = 1000 microM were achieved in 135 patients (96%). MTX clearance was decreased after cisplatin therapy (P = 0.01), after cisplatin in combination with ifosfamide therapy (P < 0.0001), and after MTX therapy (P = 0.003). In patients with localized osteosarcoma, a higher mean MTX area under the curve, a higher mean peak concentration of MTX, a longer mean time above a threshold concentration (500 microM), and a lower mean MTX clearance were associated with lower probability of event-free survival (EFS). Patients who had a mean peak MTX plasma concentration > 1500 microM were found to have a worse outcome (estimated 5-year EFS, 58.5% +/- 6.7%) compared with patients who had a mean peak concentration < or = 1500 microM (estimated 5-year EFS, 75.5% +/- 6.6%; P = 0.02). When HDMTX (12 g/m(2)) was used with multiagent therapy for patients with osteosarcoma, very high MTX exposures were associated with poorer outcome.

High-dose therapy with autologous stem cell rescue for pediatric sarcomas.,Current opinion in oncology,Curr Opin Oncol,2004-03-01,"The principal pediatric sarcomas are Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and osteosarcoma. While the prognosis for these diseases is generally favorable, it is possible to identify groups of patients with each diagnosis whose prognosis remains unacceptably poor. Based on the chemotherapy sensitivity of these tumors, many investigators have suggested that consolidation with high dose chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy followed by stem cell rescue could improve the prognosis for these high risk patients. This review evaluates the results of high dose therapy with stem cell reconstitution used to consolidate treatment of high risk patients with sarcomas. The majority of the trials which have been conducted to assess this hypothesis have treated relatively small numbers of patients. They do not use consistent definitions of high risk. They have used different regimens for cytoreduction. They have used a variety of sources for stem cells. In many series, the consolidation therapy is applied only to patients who have achieved a significant response to prior therapy and the results have then been compared to a cohort of patients with similar presenting features, not all of whom responded to initial therapy. The published results do not demonstrate an unequivocal benefit for consolidation with high-dose therapy.

Dickkopf 3 inhibits invasion and motility of Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells by modulating the Wnt-beta-catenin pathway.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2004-04-01,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is a primary malignancy of bone with a tendency to metastasize early. Despite intensive chemotherapy and surgical resection, approximately 30% of patients still develop distant metastasis. Our previous work using clinical OS samples suggested that expression of the Wnt receptor LRP5 might be associated with tumor metastasis. In the present study, we used a Dickkopf (Dkk) family member and a dominant-negative LRP5 receptor construct to modulate Wnt signaling in OS cells. Saos-2 cells, which ectopically express Dkk-3, do not undergo apoptosis and exhibit enhanced resistance to serum starvation and chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity. Transfection of Dkk-3 and dominant-negative LRP5 into Saos-2 cells significantly reduces invasion capacity and cell motility.

Between December 1994 and January 2001, 37 patients (20 males and 17 females) with a median age of 38 years (range, 18-63 years) entered the study. Ten patients had pelvic osteosarcomas (OS), 6 had malignant fibrous histiocytomas, 5 had metastatic OS, and 16 had miscellaneous histologies. The authors used doxorubicin (60-75 mg/m(2)) and ifosfamide (10 g/m(2)) followed by granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (5 microg/kg twice per day) for mobilization of PBSC, collected at a median of 12 days (range, 10-14 days). Three cycles with cisplatin (120 mg/m(2)), ifosfamide (10 g/m(2)), and doxorubicin (75 mg/m(2)), given 28 days apart, were planned followed by PBSC (2-4 x 10(6) CD34-positive cells/kg) infusion plus G-CSF. Patients received a median of three cycles (range, one to three cycles) in addition to the mobilizing cycle. The median PBSC collection was 17.5 x 10(6)/kg (range, 13.2-90.8 x 10(6)/kg) with a median of 1 apheresis (range, 1-2 aphereses). Twenty-eight patients underwent surgery, 10 achieved 95-100% necrosis, and 4 achieved 90-94% necrosis. Six patients required early discontinuation of therapy due to toxicities, two patients developed progressive disease, and one patient was deemed unresectable.

Divergent patterns of telomere maintenance mechanisms among human sarcomas: sharply contrasting prevalence of the alternative lengthening of telomeres mechanism in Ewing's sarcomas and osteosarcomas.,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",Genes Chromosomes Cancer,2004-10-01,"Two types of telomere maintenance mechanisms (TMMs) have been described in human tumors: telomerase activation and alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Although the vast majority of epithelial tumors rely on telomerase activation, many mesenchymal tumors rely on ALT for telomere maintenance, but within this tumor group, the TMMs used by translocation-associated sarcomas have not been systematically studied. We studied telomere lengths and telomerase expression and activity in 30 uncultured tumor samples and in 10 cell lines of Ewing's sarcoma, a prototypical translocation-associated sarcoma, and compared the data to an identical analysis of 60 osteosarcomas, the most common type of sarcoma lacking a specific translocation. Telomerase activity was demonstrated in 21 Ewing's sarcoma tumor samples (70%) and in 9 of 10 Ewing's sarcoma cell lines. Evidence of ALT, indicated by the presence of long and heterogeneous telomeres, was observed only in the cell line without telomerase activity and in none of the 30 Ewing's sarcoma tumor samples. The 9 Ewing's sarcoma patients whose tumors lacked detectable telomerase activity did not differ significantly from the remaining patients in age, stage, EWSR1-FLI1 fusion type, prevalence of TP53 point mutations, or overall survival. The low prevalence of ALT in Ewing's sarcoma contrasted sharply with our data on TMMs in 60 osteosarcomas, which showed ALT in 38 of 60 cases (P<0.0001). The present study, together with emerging published data on other sarcoma types, suggests that a predominance of telomerase activation in the absence of ALT may characterize sarcomas with specific chromosomal translocations (such as Ewing's sarcoma), whereas a high prevalence of ALT appears typical of sarcomas with nonspecific complex karyotypes (such as osteosarcoma).",Journal Article,5590.0,72.0,Two types of telomere maintenance mechanisms TMMs have been described in human tumors telomerase activation and alternative lengthening of telomeres ALT Although the vast majority of epithelial tumors rely on telomerase activation many mesenchymal tumors rely on ALT for telomere maintenance but within this tumor group the TMMs used by translocation-associated sarcomas have not been systematically studied We studied telomere lengths and telomerase expression and activity in 30 uncultured tumor samples and in 10 cell lines of 's a prototypical translocation-associated and compared the data to an identical analysis of 60 osteosarcomas the most common type of lacking a specific translocation Telomerase activity was demonstrated in 21 's tumor samples 70 and in 9 of 10 's cell lines Evidence of ALT indicated by the presence of long and heterogeneous telomeres was observed only in the cell line without telomerase activity and in none of the 30 's tumor samples The 9 's patients whose tumors lacked detectable telomerase activity did not differ significantly from the remaining patients in age stage EWSR1-FLI1 fusion type prevalence of TP53 point mutations or overall survival The low prevalence of ALT in 's contrasted sharply with our data on TMMs in 60 osteosarcomas which showed ALT in 38 of 60 cases P 0.0001 The present study together with emerging published data on other types suggests that a predominance of telomerase activation in the absence of ALT may characterize sarcomas with specific chromosomal translocations such as 's whereas a high prevalence of ALT appears typical of sarcomas with nonspecific complex karyotypes such as,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[100, 630, 1, 4136, 1146, 483, 24603, 47, 85, 1027, 4, 171, 57, 3916, 363, 2, 1091, 13048, 1, 7220, 4548, 242, 3, 4337, 686, 1, 701, 57, 5533, 23, 3916, 363, 445, 1569, 57, 5533, 23, 4548, 9, 4136, 1146, 84, 262, 26, 30, 87, 3, 24603, 95, 20, 2006, 41, 1479, 47, 44, 85, 3390, 656, 21, 656, 4136, 7443, 2, 3916, 55, 2, 128, 4, 201, 27929, 30, 347, 2, 4, 79, 31, 285, 1, 292, 8, 14216, 2006, 41, 2, 72, 3, 74, 6, 35, 3038, 65, 1, 335, 11089, 3, 96, 186, 267, 1, 1941, 8, 112, 2006, 3916, 128, 10, 264, 4, 239, 292, 30, 347, 431, 2, 4, 83, 1, 79, 292, 31, 285, 241, 1, 4548, 1103, 20, 3, 463, 1, 319, 2, 1564, 7220, 10, 164, 158, 4, 3, 31, 328, 187, 3916, 128, 2, 4, 1292, 1, 3, 201, 292, 30, 347, 3, 83, 292, 7, 1310, 57, 5005, 2083, 3916, 128, 205, 44, 1505, 97, 29, 3, 1844, 7, 4, 89, 82, 6620, 8327, 1212, 267, 1078, 1, 1206, 741, 138, 15, 63, 25, 3, 154, 1078, 1, 4548, 4, 292, 13257, 10833, 5, 114, 74, 23, 24603, 4, 335, 11089, 92, 224, 4548, 4, 519, 1, 335, 140, 19, 13, 488, 3, 364, 45, 1162, 5, 1478, 983, 74, 23, 127, 630, 844, 17, 8, 7593, 1, 3916, 363, 4, 3, 1127, 1, 4548, 68, 1507, 1479, 5, 112, 1860, 3262, 225, 22, 292, 547, 8, 64, 1078, 1, 4548, 1233, 3476, 1, 1479, 5, 5893, 840, 6809, 225, 22]",1652.0,15287028,24
Genome-wide array comparative genomic hybridization analysis reveals distinct amplifications in osteosarcoma.,BMC cancer,BMC Cancer,2004-08-07,"Osteosarcoma is a highly malignant bone neoplasm of children and young adults. It is characterized by extremely complex karyotypes and high frequency of chromosomal amplifications. Currently, only the histological response (degree of necrosis) to therapy represent gold standard for predicting the outcome in a patient with non-metastatic osteosarcoma at the time of definitive surgery. Patients with lower degree of necrosis have a higher risk of relapse and poor outcome even after chemotherapy and complete resection of the primary tumor. Therefore, a better understanding of the underlying molecular genetic events leading to tumor initiation and progression could result in the identification of potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets. We used a genome-wide screening method - array based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) to identify DNA copy number changes in 48 patients with osteosarcoma. We applied fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to validate some of amplified clones in this study. Clones showing gains (79%) were more frequent than losses (66%). High-level amplifications and homozygous deletions constitute 28.6% and 3.8% of tumor genome respectively. High-level amplifications were present in 238 clones, of which about 37% of them showed recurrent amplification. Most frequently amplified clones were mapped to 1p36.32 (PRDM16), 6p21.1 (CDC5L, HSPCB, NFKBIE), 8q24, 12q14.3 (IFNG), 16p13 (MGRN1), and 17p11.2 (PMP22 MYCD, SOX1,ELAC27). We validated some of the amplified clones by FISH from 6p12-p21, 8q23-q24, and 17p11.2 amplicons. Homozygous deletions were noted for 32 clones and only 7 clones showed in more than one case. These 7 clones were mapped to 1q25.1 (4 cases), 3p14.1 (4 cases), 13q12.2 (2 cases), 4p15.1 (2 cases), 6q12 (2 cases), 6q12 (2 cases) and 6q16.3 (2 cases).

Telomerase expression predicts unfavorable outcome in osteosarcoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2004-09-01,"Osteosarcoma is distinct from most cancers in that the majority of osteosarcomas lack telomerase expression and use the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism to maintain telomeres. Laboratory studies suggest that compared with ALT, telomerase expression is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness. We evaluated the clinical significance of telomerase expression in human osteosarcoma. Fifty-six osteosarcomas from 51 patients treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital between 1982 and 2003 were evaluated for telomerase enzyme activity, mRNA expression of the catalytic component of telomerase (TERT), and presence of the ALT pathway. Outcome analysis was based on TERT mRNA expression in the primary tumor samples from 44 patients. Fourteen primary tumors expressed TERT mRNA (32%; eight TERT only, six TERT and ALT) and 30 did not express TERT mRNA (68%; 29 ALT, one no ALT). Progression-free survival (PFS) was inferior in the TERT-positive group compared with the TERT-negative group (3-year estimates, 21.4% +/- 9.5% v 63.7% +/- 11.1%; P =.014). Likewise, overall survival was inferior in the TERT-positive group compared with the TERT-negative group (3-year estimates, 42.9% +/- 12.2% v 70.0% +/- 9.9%; P =.031). Among 31 patients with nonmetastatic disease at diagnosis, PFS was lower in the TERT-positive group compared with the TERT-negative group (3-year estimates, 33.3% +/- 13.6% v 72.0% +/- 11.5%; P =.092).

Radiotherapy for local control of osteosarcoma.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2005-02-01,"Local control of osteosarcoma in patients for whom a resection with satisfactory margins is not achieved can be difficult. This study evaluated the efficacy of radiotherapy (RT) in this setting. We identified 41 patients in our sarcoma database with osteosarcomas that either were not resected or were excised with close or positive margins and who underwent RT with external beam photons and/or protons at our institution between 1980 and 2002. Patient charts were reviewed to assess local control, progression-free survival, metastasis-free survival, and overall survival. The anatomic sites treated were head/face/skull in 17, extremity in 8, spine in 8, pelvis in 7, and trunk in 1. Of the 41 patients, 27 (65.85%) had undergone gross total tumor resection, 9 (21.95%) subtotal resection, and 5 (12.2%) biopsy only. The radiation dose ranged from 10 to 80 Gy (median 66). Twenty-three patients (56.1%) received a portion of their RT with protons. Chemotherapy was given to 35 patients (85.4%). Of the 41 patients, 27 (65.85%) were treated for localized disease at primary presentation, 10 (24.4%) for local recurrence, and 4 (9.8%) for metastatic disease. The overall local control rate at 5 years was 68% +/- 8.3%. The local control rate according to the extent of resection was 78.4% +/- 8.6% for gross total resection 77.8% +/- 13.9% for subtotal resection, and 40% +/- 21.9% for biopsy only (p < 0.01). The overall survival rate according to the extent of resection was 74.45% +/- 9.1% for gross total resection, 74.1% +/- 16.1% for subtotal resection, and 25% +/- 21.65% for biopsy only (p < 0.001). Patients with either gross or subtotal resection had a greater rate of local control, survival, and disease-free survival compared with those who underwent biopsy only at 5 years (77.7% +/- 7.5% vs. 40% +/- 21% [p <0.001], 73.9% +/- 8.1% vs. 25% +/- 21.6% [p <0.001], and 51.9% +/- 9.1% vs. 25% +/- 21.6% [p <0.01], respectively). Overall survival was better in patients treated at primary presentation (78.8% +/- 8.6% compared with 54% +/- 17.3% for recurrence) p <0.05). No definitive dose-response relationship for local control of tumor was seen, although the local control rate was 71% +/- 9% for 32 patients receiving doses > or =55 Gy vs. 53.6% +/- 20.1% for 9 patients receiving <55 Gy (p = 0.11).

Methotrexate levels and outcome in osteosarcoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2005-06-01,"Peak serum concentrations of methotrexate (MTX) have been reported to correlate with outcome in osteosarcoma (OS). Modification of the MTX dose to achieve peak levels between 700 and 1,000 micromol/L has been recommended. The goal of the study was to assess whether there is a correlation between histologic necrosis of the tumor and/or prognosis with peak MTX serum concentration. Treatment included multi-agent adjuvant chemotherapy, including high-dose MTX (12 g/m2). Peak MTX levels were drawn following a 4-hr infusion. Histologic evaluation for percent necrosis was done at the time of definitive resection. The median peak MTX level (n = 52 patients) was 1,060 micromol/L (range: 410-4,700 micromol/L), with significant intra-patient and inter-patient variability. Fifty-eight percent of the levels were 1,000 micromol/L or higher. Response to pre-operative chemotherapy was: 18% Grade I necrosis, 35% Grade II, 31% Grade III, and 16% Grade IV. No significant association was found between the mean peak MTX levels and necrosis (P = 0.44). Event-free survival (EFS) for the 48 patients with non-metastatic disease at diagnosis was 76% at 4 years of follow-up, with no association between the mean peak MTX level and EFS (P = 0.24).

An expression signature classifies chemotherapy-resistant pediatric osteosarcoma.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2005-03-01,"Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumor in children. Osteosarcoma patients who respond poorly to chemotherapy are at a higher risk of relapse and adverse outcome. Therefore, it was the aim of this study to identify prognostic factors at the time of diagnosis to characterize the genes predictive of poor survival outcome and to identify potential novel therapeutic targets. Expression profiling of 30 osteosarcoma diagnostic biopsy samples, 15 with inferior necrosis following induction chemotherapy (Huvos I/II) and 15 with superior necrosis following induction chemotherapy (Huvos III/IV), was conducted using Affymetrix U95Av2 oligonucleotide microarrays. One hundred and four genes were found to be statistically significant and highly differentially expressed between Huvos I/II and III/IV patients. Statistically significant genes were validated on a small independent cohort comprised of osteosarcoma xenograft tumor samples. Markers of Huvos I/II response predominantly were gene products involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment remodeling and osteoclast differentiation. A striking finding was the significant decrease in osteoprotegerin, an osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor. Additional genes involved in osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption, which were statistically different, include annexin 2, SMAD, PLA2G2A, and TGFbeta1. ECM remodeling genes include desmoplakin, SPARCL1, biglycan, and PECAM. Gene expression of select genes involved in tumor progression, ECM remodeling, and osteoclastogenesis were validated via quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in an independent cohort.

Messenger RNA expression levels of CXCR4 correlate with metastatic behavior and outcome in patients with osteosarcoma.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2005-04-01,"To determine if osteosarcoma cells express chemokine receptors and if their presence or absence relates to clinical features. Using fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR, the pattern of 17 chemokine receptors in 3 osteosarcoma cell lines and 68 osteosarcoma patient samples was analyzed. The expression of the chemokine receptors was generally low among the cell lines. In the high-grade osteosarcoma patient samples (n = 47), CXCR4 was the most commonly expressed (63%) and its expression level was inversely correlated to overall survival (P < 0.0001), event-free survival (P < 0.001), and metastasis-free survival (MFS; P = 0.002). There was also a correlation between the expression level of CXCR4 and the presence of metastasis at diagnosis (P = 0.002). CCR7 was expressed in 43% of the samples and its expression level was inversely correlated with overall survival (P = 0.03) and MFS (P = 0.007). CCR10 mRNA expression level was inversely correlated with MFS (P = 0.009). There was no association between the expression of CXCR4, CCR7, and CCR10. Of the 26 samples studied for stromal cell-derived factor-1 expression, 77% expressed it, but there was no correlation with the clinical variables or CXCR4 expression. Multivariate analysis revealed that mRNA expression level of CXCR4 was the only significant variable for overall survival (P = 0.0006), event-free survival (P = 0.004), and MFS (P = 0.025). These data suggest that CXCR4 could be useful as a prognostic factor and as a predictor of potential metastatic development in osteosarcoma.

Overview of sarcomas in the adolescent and young adult population.,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol.,2005-04-01,"Based on the data of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Section of the National Cancer Institute (SEER) program, soft tissue and bone sarcomas account for about 1% of all new malignancies diagnosed in the United States each year. However, there are numerous different histologic types, and any given type of sarcoma is extremely rare. Determining the incidence of sarcomas by age and type is difficult due to the limited data reported. The SEER program collects data regarding age but only limited data on histology, while most series reported in the literature include either adults or pediatric patients, but rarely both. In an effort to estimate the frequency and absolute numbers of different sarcomas in the adolescent and young adult population, the University of Texas M. D.

Primary hyperparathyroidism and osteosarcoma: examination of a large cohort identifies three cases of fibroblastic osteosarcoma.,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,J. Bone Miner. Res.,2005-05-09,"To study a possible relationship between hyperparathyroidism and osteosarcoma, we reviewed 1234 osteosarcoma patients. In this cohort, only three patients had a diagnosis of both hyperparathyroidism and fibroblastic osteosarcoma. These results indicate that hyperparathyroidism is not more prevalent in patients with osteosarcoma than in the general population. However, the presence of hyperparathyroidism may modify the histologic and cytologic features of osteosarcoma. The finding of osteosarcoma in rats receiving human PTH(1-34) raised the question of whether hyperparathyroidism might be a risk factor for development of osteosarcoma in humans. To study a possible relationship between hyperparathyroidism and osteosarcoma, we reviewed the medical records of 1234 osteosarcoma patients seen at The M.D. Anderson Cancer Center since 1948. Our study focused on clinical, biochemical, radiologic, and histopathologic findings indicative of primary hyperparathyroidism and the features of osteosarcoma. Of the 1234 cases reviewed, 3 patients had a diagnosis of both primary hyperparathyroidism and osteosarcoma. In two cases, hyperparathyroidism preceded the osteosarcoma, and in one case, both conditions were diagnosed at the same time. In two cases with concomitant hyperparathyroidism and osteosarcoma, features of osteitis fibrocystica were identified. The third patient was treated for hyperparathyroidism 3 years before osteosarcoma was diagnosed. All three patients had histologic features of fibroblastic osteosarcoma, a type that accounts for no more than 20% of osteosarcomas. To assess whether the prevalence of hyperparathyroidism was greater than expected in the normal population, we compared the age- and sex-specific prevalence in our cohort to a population of healthy individuals in Tromso, Norway.

We reviewed the clinical, radiographic, and pathologic features of 14 cases of pediatric surface OS treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital between 1970 and 2003. Seven patients had parosteal, five had periosteal, and two had high-grade surface OS. The median age at diagnosis was 16.2 years (range, 13.6-18.5 years). Nine patients were male; 11 were Caucasian. None had metastatic disease at diagnosis. Primary tumor sites included distal femur (n = 6), mid to proximal femur (n = 4), and mid to proximal tibia (n = 4). All 14 patients were treated with surgery, and 7 (1 with parosteal, 4 with periosteal, 2 with high-grade tumors) received chemotherapy. One patient experienced pulmonary metastasis of periosteal OS 16 months and 43 months after diagnosis; long-term disease-free survival followed resection of the metastatic tumors. Twelve patients remained alive and disease-free a median of 10 years (range, 1.5-25.4 years) after diagnosis.

Fas expression in lung metastasis from osteosarcoma patients.,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol.,2005-11-01,"The authors' animal studies have shown that the metastatic potential of osteosarcoma (OS) cells correlates inversely with Fas expression-that is, Fas-negative cells metastasize but Fas-positive cells do not. One reason for this in the context of OS lung metastases may be that Fas-positive cells are eliminated by engagement with the Fas ligand (FasL) constitutively expressed on the surface of pneumocytes, whereas Fas-negative tumor cells are not. The purpose of this study was to determine the status of Fas expression in OS lung metastases from patients. Specifically, archived paraffin-embedded specimens of lung metastases from 38 patients with OS were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Lung nodules from 23 of the 38 patients (60%) were Fas negative, those from 12 patients (32%) were weakly positive, and that from only 1 patient (3%) was strongly positive. Findings in the samples from the remaining two patients (5%) could not be interpreted because of extensive necrosis. Most patients with the weakly positive tumors and the single patient with the strongly positive tumor received chemotherapy prior to lung resection. There was a significant correlation between Fas expression and the administration of preoperative salvage chemotherapy (P = 0.0013).

Twelve patients (median age, 15.1 yrs) were treated in OS-86 for osteosarcoma metastatic to the lung only (11 patients) or bone only (1 patient), and 17 patients (median age, 15.1 yrs) were treated in OS-91 for osteosarcoma metastatic to the lung only (12 patients), bone only (2 patients), lung and bone (2 patients), or other site (1 patient). Patients with metastatic disease enrolled in OS-86 and those with metastatic disease enrolled in OS-91 did not differ in terms of demographic features, histologic subtype, site of primary tumor, or site of metastases. There was a difference in survival according to treatment protocol (P = 0.054). All survivors (four of whom were enrolled in OS-86 and one of whom was enrolled in OS-91) had lung metastases only. Five-year survival estimates for patients with lung metastases only were 45.5 +/- 13.7% (OS-86) and 8.3 +/- 5.6% (OS-91) (P = 0.084). Unilateral lung metastases (P = 0.006), no more than three lung nodules (P = 0.014), and surgical remission (P = 0.001) were associated with improved survival probability.

Osteosarcoma among children aged 5 years or younger: the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital experience.,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol.,2006-01-01,Osteosarcoma primarily affects adolescents. The authors reviewed the records of eight patients aged 5 years or younger (of 470 patients with osteosarcoma) treated at their institution. Tumors (seven of high grade and one of low grade) arose mostly in the appendicular skeleton; one patient had metastases. One patient with low-grade osteosarcoma survived after surgery alone. Two with active disease died of chemotherapy toxicity. The remaining five (three received chemotherapy) underwent surgery and are long-term survivors. Two who underwent hemipelvectomy or hip disarticulation would likely have undergone limb-sparing surgery today.

"Evaluation of the antitumor efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the histone deacetylase inhibitor depsipeptide in childhood cancer models in vivo.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2006-01-01,"Histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDAC) control the acetylation state of histones and other proteins regulating transcription and protein function. Several structurally diverse HDAC inhibitors have been developed as cancer therapeutic agents and in vitro have been shown to cause differentiation, cell cycle arrest, or apoptosis. Here, we have evaluated depsipeptide, a natural tetrapeptide HDAC inhibitor, against a panel of pediatric solid tumor models in vivo and evaluated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variables with tumor sensitivity. Depsipeptide was administered at the maximum tolerated dose (4.4 mg/kg administered every 7 days x 3 i.v. repeated q21d for a total of two cycles) to scid mice bearing 39 independently derived childhood tumors (9 brain tumors, 11 kidney cancers, 9 rhabdomyosarcomas, 3 neuroblastomas, and 7 osteosarcomas). Pharmacokinetic variables were determined, as were changes in histone and p53 acetylation, induction of p53 and p53 genotype, and alterations in Akt phosphorylation. Of 39 tumors evaluated, three showed objective tumor regressions [two brain tumors (primitive neuroectodermal tumor and atypical teratoid malignant rhabdoid tumor) and one Wilms' tumor]. Depsipeptide inhibited growth of many tumor lines but achieved stable disease (<25% increase in volume during treatment cycle 1) in only two tumor models (anaplastic astrocytoma, two rhabdomyosarcomas, and a Wilms' tumor). Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the population estimated AUC(0-24) was 1,123 ng h/mL, similar to the exposure following 13 mg/m2 in ongoing phase I trials. Pharmacodynamic changes in histone acetylation (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) in three depsipeptide-sensitive and three intrinsically resistant tumors followed a similar pattern; maximal increases in histone acetylation occurred at 8 hours and were elevated for up to 96 hours. In two sensitive tumor lines, IRS56 and BT27 (both wild-type p53) p53 increased in treated tumors being maximal at 8 hours and associated with induction of p21(cip1), whereas p53 was stable in tumors with mutant p53. Sensitivity to depsipeptide did not correlate with p53 genotype, p53 acetylation, cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, or phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473). Our results show that depsipeptide inhibits its target in vivo causing increased histone acetylation; however, this does not correlate with drug sensitivity. The relatively low objective response rate [3 of 39 (8%) tumor lines showing greater than or equal to partial response and 4 (10%) stable disease] administered at dose levels that give clinically relevant drug exposures suggests that as a single agent depsipeptide may have limited clinical utility against pediatric solid tumors in a first-line setting.",Journal Article,5133.0,75.0,"Histone

Computed tomographic scan of the chest underestimates the number of metastatic lesions in osteosarcoma.,Journal of pediatric surgery,J. Pediatr. Surg.,2006-01-01,"Survival in osteosarcoma correlates with complete resection of primary and metastatic disease. The feasibility of complete pulmonary metastasectomy using thoracoscopy has been raised. Because palpation is not possible, minimally invasive techniques require preoperative radiological enumeration and localization of metastases not presenting at the lung surface. We hypothesized that computed tomographic (CT) scanning underestimated the number of pulmonary metastases in these patients. Institutional review board approval was obtained. We determined the association between the number of lesions identified by CT scanning and the number of metastases found at thoracotomies for metastatic osteosarcoma from May 1996 to October 2004. Correlations between CT findings and pathology results were computed using the Kendall tau-b correlation coefficient. Depth, in millimeters, from the pleural surface was measured for those lesions seen on CT scan. We analyzed 54 consecutive thoracotomies performed in 28 patients for whom complete imaging was available. Computed tomographic scanning was performed a median of 20 days before thoracotomy (range, 1-85 days). Correlation between the number of lesions identified by CT and the number of metastases resected at surgery was poor, with a Kendall tau-b correlation coefficient of 0.45 (P < .001). In 19 (35%) of 54 thoracotomies, CT scanning underestimated the number of pathologically proven, viable and nonviable metastases found by the surgeon. Accounting for viable metastases only, correlation between the number of lesions identified by CT and the number of metastases resected at surgery was 0.50 (P < .001), and CT scanning underestimated the number of viable metastases present in 14 (26%) of 54 thoracotomies. Many lesions (32%) were pleural-based, but nearly half (47%) were 5 mm or deeper from the pleural surface of the lung. Even in the era of modern CT scanning, only a very rough correlation exists between CT findings and the number of lesions identified at thoracotomy.

Evaluation of gefitinib for treatment of refractory solid tumors and central nervous system malignancies in pediatric patients.,Cancer investigation,Cancer Invest.,,"Gefitinib (ZD1839, Iressa), a member of the 4-anilinoquinazoline class of compounds, has the chemical name 4-quinazolinamine, N-(3-chloro-4-flurophenyl)-7-methoxy-6-[3-(4-morpholinyl)propoxy]. Gefitinib often is referred to as a ""specific"" or ""selective"" inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR expression has been noted in neuroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines and in tumor specimens from children with Wilms tumor, osteosarcoma, and glioma. Thus, gefitinib, the first marketed EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was chosen for study in children with refractory solid tumors and central nervous system (CNS) malignancies. This review discusses findings from 3 clinical trials of gefitinib in children with refractory solid tumors and CNS malignancies, focusing on the clinical pharmacology of the compound. To date, gefitinib has been studied in children as a single agent and in combination with irinotecan. Overall, the compound has been well tolerated in children and has a safety profile similar to that observed in adults. The clinical pharmacokinetics of gefitinib in children are similar to those observed in adults. Finally, the future for the use of gefitinib in pediatrics is similar to that of other molecularly targeted agents and awaits definition of tumors and patient populations in which it will be most advantageous.",Journal Article,,33.0,Gefitinib ZD1839 Iressa a member of the 4-anilinoquinazoline class of compounds has the chemical name 4-quinazolinamine N- 3-chloro-4-flurophenyl -7-methoxy-6- 3- 4-morpholinyl propoxy Gefitinib often is referred to as a `` specific '' or `` selective '' inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR EGFR expression has been noted in and cell lines and in tumor specimens from children with tumor and glioma Thus gefitinib the first marketed EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor was chosen for study in children with refractory solid tumors and central nervous system CNS malignancies This review discusses findings from 3 clinical trials of gefitinib in children with refractory solid tumors and CNS malignancies focusing on the clinical pharmacology of the compound To date gefitinib has been studied in children as a single agent and in combination with irinotecan Overall the compound has been well tolerated in children and has a safety profile similar to that observed in adults The clinical pharmacokinetics of gefitinib in children are similar to those observed in adults Finally the future for the use of gefitinib in pediatrics is similar to that of other molecularly targeted agents and awaits definition of tumors and patient populations in which it will be most advantageous,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1372, 5153, 8630, 8, 2693, 1, 3, 39, 27859, 1040, 1, 2411, 71, 3, 3743, 9812, 39, 55606, 78, 27, 14778, 39, 55607, 67, 26436, 49, 27, 39, 55608, 55609, 1372, 629, 16, 1995, 6, 22, 8, 112, 522, 15, 1094, 522, 230, 1, 829, 129, 161, 153, 227, 227, 55, 71, 85, 1051, 4, 2, 31, 285, 2, 4, 30, 623, 29, 541, 5, 30, 2, 945, 631, 1372, 3, 157, 22371, 227, 564, 216, 230, 10, 4695, 9, 45, 4, 541, 5, 430, 537, 57, 2, 854, 1880, 398, 1025, 441, 26, 206, 2759, 272, 29, 27, 38, 143, 1, 1372, 4, 541, 5, 430, 537, 57, 2, 1025, 441, 3312, 23, 3, 38, 6852, 1, 3, 2823, 6, 1244, 1372, 71, 85, 656, 4, 541, 22, 8, 226, 420, 2, 4, 150, 5, 1071, 63, 3, 2823, 71, 85, 149, 421, 4, 541, 2, 71, 8, 367, 800, 288, 6, 17, 164, 4, 857, 3, 38, 1159, 1, 1372, 4, 541, 32, 288, 6, 135, 164, 4, 857, 1368, 3, 508, 9, 3, 119, 1, 1372, 4, 12616, 16, 288, 6, 17, 1, 127, 2372, 238, 183, 2, 15462, 2470, 1, 57, 2, 69, 1184, 4, 92, 192, 303, 40, 96, 10650]",1287.0,16809160,259

Treatment algorithm for locally recurrent osteosarcoma based on local disease-free interval and the presence of lung metastasis.,Cancer,Cancer,2006-10-01,"Local recurrence in osteosarcoma is clinically distinct from metastasis, although associated with a similar reduction in survival. The prognostic factors in locally recurrent osteosarcoma were investigated and these factors were translated into a management strategy. In all, 407 consecutive patients with skeletal osteosarcoma between 1977 and 2002 were analyzed. Twenty-three patients with resectable local recurrence were analyzed. Clinical and tumor-related factors were assessed for significance in relation to survival and a management strategy was formulated based on factors found to be independently significant for survival. Seventeen of the 23 patients underwent primary resections and initial treatment, yielding an overall local recurrence rate of 4.2% for resectable cancer. Median time to local recurrence was 13 months (95% confidence interval, 9-16 months). The 5-year and 10-year survival rates in the recurrent cases were 29% and 10%, respectively. All patients received chemotherapy both for their primary and recurrent disease. Increased risk of local recurrence (P < .0001) was strongly correlated with positive margins of resection. The rate of local recurrence was not related to chemotherapy-associated necrosis in the primary tumor. Nevertheless, neoadjuvant therapy halved the risk of local recurrence (odds ratio, 1.92; P = .3, power 10%). The strongest correlate with poor survival was local recurrence within the first year after primary resection (P = .001), followed by metastasis at the time of first local recurrence (P = .04) and failure to achieve clinical remission after disease recurrence (P = .04). Chemotherapy-associated necrosis and margins of resection of the primary tumor were not significant prognostic variables for survival. Survival differed significantly among patients defined by local disease-free interval and lung metastasis (P = .0001). They required an individualized approach as captured in the management algorithm.

Combined depletion of cell cycle and transcriptional cyclin-dependent kinase activities induces apoptosis in cancer cells.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2006-09-01,"Selective cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 2 inhibition is readily compensated. However, reduced cdk2 activity may have antiproliferative effects in concert with other family members. Here, inducible RNA interference was used to codeplete cdk2 and cdk1 from NCI-H1299 non-small cell lung cancer and U2OS osteosarcoma cells, and effects were compared with those mediated by depletion of either cdk alone. Depletion of cdk2 slowed G1 progression of NCI-H1299 cells and depletion of cdk1 slowed G2-M progression in both cell lines, with associated endoreduplication in U2OS cells. However, compared with the incomplete cell cycle blocks produced by individual depletion, combined depletion had substantial consequences, with G2-M arrest predominating in NCI-H1299 cells and apoptosis the primary outcome in U2OS cells. In U2OS cells, combined depletion affected RNA polymerase II expression and phosphorylation, causing decreased expression of the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), effects usually mediated by inhibition of the transcriptional cdk9.

The cause and clinical significance of central tumor photopenia on thallium scintigraphy of pediatric osteosarcoma of the extremity.,AJR. American journal of roentgenology,AJR Am J Roentgenol,2007-02-01,"The objectives of our study were to determine whether central tumor photopenia on thallium-201 (201Tl) scintigraphy of primary osteosarcoma results from central tumor necrosis or dense central tumor ossification and to determine the relation of this finding to tumor response to chemotherapy and to patient survival. After the institutional review board approved our study and waived the need for patient or parental consent, two radiologists independently reviewed 201Tl scans, conventional radiographs, and MR images of 57 patients obtained at diagnosis of extremity primary nonmetastatic osteosarcoma to detect the presence of central tumor photopenia on 201Tl scintigraphy and estimate outer tumor ossification versus inner tumor ossification and enhancement. The dynamic enhanced MRI parameters dynamic vector magnitude (DVM) and k(ep) (measure of the exchange rate between plasma and extracellular fluid space) were compared for outer tumor versus inner tumor, and the relation among 201Tl scintigraphy, conventional radiography, MRI, and the dynamic enhanced MRI parameters was analyzed. We examined whether central tumor photopenia on 201Tl imaging was related to histologic response or to patient survival. Thirty-three patients (58%) had central tumor photopenia on 201Tl imaging that was not associated with central tumor ossification (p = 0.8) or with the difference between outer tumor and inner tumor contrast enhancement (p = 0.4). Central tumor photopenia on 201Tl scintigraphy was significantly associated with an increasing difference between outer tumor DVM and inner tumor DVM (i.e., outer tumor DVM minus inner tumor DVM) (p = 0.05), an increasing difference between outer tumor k(ep) and inner tumor k(ep) (i.e., outer k(ep) minus inner k(ep)) (p = 0.01), and an increasing outer k(ep)-inner k(ep) ratio (p = 0.02). We found no relation between central tumor photopenia and histologic response (p > or = 0.2). Older patients (age, > or = 13 years) with central tumor photopenia were least likely to survive, whereas younger patients (age, < 13 years) without central tumor photopenia were most likely to survive (p = 0.07). Central tumor photopenia on 201Tl scintigraphy of primary osteosarcoma is unlikely to reflect central ossification but may be due to central necrosis reflected by higher outer tumor DVM and k(ep) than inner tumor DVM and k(ep) and may be negatively associated with survival in older patients.

Blocking Wnt/LRP5 signaling by a soluble receptor modulates the epithelial to mesenchymal transition and suppresses met and metalloproteinases in osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells.,Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,J. Orthop. Res.,2007-07-01,"We previously reported the Wnt receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) was frequently expressed in osteosarcoma (OS) tissue and correlated with metastasis and a lower disease-free survival. Subsequent in vitro analysis revealed that dominant-negative, soluble LRP5 (sLRP5) can reduce in vitro cellular invasion. In the current study, we examined the molecular mechanisms of blocking canonical Wnt signaling by sLRP5 in Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells. Transfection of sLRP5 caused a marked up-regulation of E-cadherin in this cell line. This increase in E-cadherin, seen primarily at the cell-cell contact borders, was associated with down-regulation of Slug and Twist, transcriptional repressors which mediate cancer invasion and metastasis. In contrast, N-cadherin, a mesenchymal marker, was reduced by sLRP5. In addition, blocking Wnt signaling by sLRP5 modulated other epithelial and mesenchymal markers (keratin 8 and 18, fibronectin), suggesting a reversal of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) seen during cancer progression. SLRP5 also reduced the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 and 14, consistent with a decrease in invasive capacity. SLRP5 transfection decreased both Met expression and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced cell motility. Taken together, these results support a role for Wnt/LRP5 signaling in invasiveness of a subset of OS cells.",Journal Article,4587.0,77.0,We previously reported the Wnt receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 LRP5 was frequently expressed in OS tissue and correlated with metastasis and a lower disease-free survival Subsequent in vitro analysis revealed that dominant-negative soluble LRP5 sLRP5 can reduce in vitro cellular invasion In the current study we examined the molecular mechanisms of blocking canonical Wnt signaling by sLRP5 in Saos-2 cells Transfection of sLRP5 caused a marked up-regulation of E-cadherin in this cell line This increase in E-cadherin seen primarily at the cell-cell contact borders was associated with down-regulation of Slug and Twist transcriptional repressors which mediate cancer invasion and metastasis In contrast N-cadherin a mesenchymal marker was reduced by sLRP5 In addition blocking Wnt signaling by sLRP5 modulated other epithelial and mesenchymal markers keratin 8 and 18 fibronectin suggesting a reversal of epithelial-mesenchymal transition EMT seen during cancer progression SLRP5 also reduced the expression of matrix metalloproteinase MMP 2 and 14 consistent with a decrease in invasive capacity SLRP5 transfection decreased both Met expression and growth factor HGF -induced cell motility Taken together these results support a role for Wnt/LRP5 signaling in invasiveness of a subset of OS cells,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 373, 210, 3, 2112, 153, 154, 1263, 8984, 153, 139, 178, 33, 15238, 10, 746, 570, 4, 118, 246, 2, 438, 5, 278, 2, 8, 280, 34, 115, 25, 706, 4, 439, 65, 553, 17, 2156, 199, 2968, 15238, 26579, 122, 969, 4, 439, 763, 578, 4, 3, 291, 45, 21, 409, 3, 219, 483, 1, 2521, 4471, 2112, 314, 20, 26579, 4, 33328, 18, 37, 3789, 1, 26579, 1546, 8, 2003, 126, 863, 1, 563, 2154, 4, 26, 31, 328, 26, 344, 4, 563, 2154, 527, 1561, 28, 3, 31, 31, 4393, 14623, 10, 41, 5, 1328, 863, 1, 5935, 2, 6950, 1431, 16052, 92, 3367, 12, 578, 2, 278, 4, 748, 78, 2154, 8, 1569, 952, 10, 405, 20, 26579, 4, 352, 2521, 2112, 314, 20, 26579, 1757, 127, 701, 2, 1569, 525, 11535, 66, 2, 203, 8629, 802, 8, 5933, 1, 701, 1569, 1970, 2208, 527, 190, 12, 91, 26579, 120, 405, 3, 55, 1, 2248, 4914, 2151, 18, 2, 213, 925, 5, 8, 775, 4, 416, 2162, 26579, 3789, 340, 110, 543, 55, 2, 129, 161, 2942, 277, 31, 3603, 1633, 1162, 46, 99, 538, 8, 200, 9, 2112, 15238, 314, 4, 3807, 1, 8, 697, 1, 118, 37]",1328.0,17318900,111
Upfront window trial of topotecan in previously untreated children and adolescents with poor prognosis metastatic osteosarcoma: children's Cancer Group (CCG) 7943.,Cancer,Cancer,2007-04-01,"Patients with metastatic osteosarcoma have a poor prognosis. The objectives of the study were to determine the antitumor activity and toxicity of topotecan (daily x5) in newly diagnosed patients with metastatic osteosarcoma followed by chemotherapy (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide [ICE], alternating with cisplatin and doxorubicin [CD]). Newly diagnosed patients (< or =30 years of age) with extensive metastatic disease (primary and > or =5 pulmonary nodules and/or bone metastases) with normal hepatic, renal, and cardiac function were eligible. Patients were eligible to receive further topotecan after standard chemotherapy if they exhibited a response. Twenty-eight patients were enrolled. Seventeen had metastases to the lung only and 11 had metastases to the bone or multiple sites. Of 28 patients enrolled, 27 could be evaluated for response. A limited dose escalation was incorporated. No responses were seen in the 11 patients treated at 3 mg/m(2)/day. One partial response (PR) and 1 clinical response (CLR) were reported among 15 patients who received topotecan at 3.5 mg/m(2)/day. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed. Principal nondose-limiting toxicities were hematologic and gastrointestinal. The 2- and 5-year event-free survival rates were low, 7% and 4%, respectively, but the 2- and 5-year overall survival rates were 44% and 22%, respectively.

Dasatinib inhibits migration and invasion in diverse human sarcoma cell lines and induces apoptosis in bone sarcoma cells dependent on SRC kinase for survival.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2007-03-01,"Sarcomas are rare malignant mesenchymal tumors for which there are limited treatment options. One potential molecular target for sarcoma treatment is the Src tyrosine kinase. Dasatinib (BMS-354825), a small-molecule inhibitor of Src kinase activity, is a promising cancer therapeutic agent with p.o. bioavailability. Dasatinib exhibits antitumor effects in cultured human cell lines derived from epithelial tumors, including prostate and lung carcinomas. However, the action of dasatinib in mesenchymally derived tumors has yet to be shown. Based on our previous findings of Src activation in human sarcomas, we evaluated the effects of dasatinib in 12 cultured human sarcoma cell lines derived from bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Dasatinib inhibited Src kinase activity at nanomolar concentrations in these sarcoma cell lines. Downstream components of Src signaling, including focal adhesion kinase and Crk-associated substrate (p130(CAS)), were also inhibited at similar concentrations. This inhibition of Src signaling was accompanied by blockade of cell migration and invasion. Moreover, apoptosis was induced in the osteosarcoma and Ewing's subset of bone sarcomas at nanomolar concentrations of dasatinib. Inhibition of Src protein expression by small interfering RNA also induced apoptosis, indicating that these bone sarcoma cell lines are dependent on Src activity for survival. These results show that dasatinib inhibits migration and invasion of diverse sarcoma cell types and selectively blocks the survival of bone sarcoma cells.

Over-expression of parathyroid hormone Type 1 receptor confers an aggressive phenotype in osteosarcoma.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2007-09-01,"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone malignancy in children and is associated with rapid bone growth. Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) signaling via parathyroid hormone Type 1 receptor (PTHR1) is important for skeletal development and is involved in bone metastases in other tumors. The aim of this study was to investigate the status of PTHrP/PTHR1 and its possible role in osteosarcoma. In a preliminary screening, a higher level of PTHR1 mRNA, but not PTHrP, was found in 4 osteosarcoma xenografts as compared with 4 standard cell lines, or 5 patient derived cell lines (p < 0.05) using quantitative RT-PCR. It was therefore extended to 55 patient specimens, in which a significantly higher level of PTHR1 mRNA was detected in metastatic or relapsed samples than those from primary sites (p < 0.01). Cell behavior caused by PTHR1 overexpression was further studied in vitro using PTHR1 transfected HOS cell line as a model. Over-expression of PHTR1 resulted in increased proliferation, motility and Matrigel invasion without addition of exogenous PTHrP suggesting an autocrine effect. Importantly, the aggressiveness in PTHR1-expressing cells was completely reversed by RNAi mediated gene knockdown.

The folate receptor alpha is frequently overexpressed in osteosarcoma samples and plays a role in the uptake of the physiologic substrate 5-methyltetrahydrofolate.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2007-05-01,"Two major systems exist for folate cell entry: the reduced folate carrier (RFC) and the folate receptor (FR). Although defective RFC-mediated transport was frequently identified as a mechanism of methotrexate (MTX) resistance in osteosarcoma, the status of FR and its role in this disease are unknown. mRNA for FR alpha was measured in 107 osteosarcoma specimens using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and was related to RFC expression. The effect of FR alpha overexpression on MTX resistance and natural folate uptake was studied using FR alpha non-expressing osteosarcoma 143B cells transfected with FR alpha cDNA in comparison with those transfected with sense or antisense RFC in the same genetic background. Eighty-four samples (78.5%) had detectable FR alpha mRNA, and 29.9% had higher levels than the ovarian cancer cell line SKOV-3. No correlation was found between mRNA levels of FR alpha and RFC (r(2)=0.002). FR alpha overexpression had minor effects on the transport of MTX and sensitivity to this drug. Among the transfected 143B sublines, only the 143B-FR alpha was able to uptake 5-methyltetrahydrofolate when the extracellular concentration was reduced to 2 nmol/L, which conferred a growth advantage in physiologic folate concentrations compared with vector-only-transfected cells. Importantly, this was not similarly achieved by RFC overexpression. This study suggests that FR alpha plays a role in the uptake of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate when the concentration gradient is insufficient for RFC-mediated transport.

Opportunities for improving the therapeutic ratio for patients with sarcoma.,The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2007-06-01,"Sarcomas are mesenchymal cancers, which, in many cases, have distinctive molecular features. Limb-sparing surgery delivered at specialised sarcoma centres as part of a multidisciplinary approach has become the standard treatment for most patients and usually provides excellent local control. Preoperative treatment with chemotherapy is most common for patients with bone sarcomas. The ideal sequence of surgery and radiation for local management of soft-tissue sarcoma remains controversial on the basis of early versus late treatment complications, although preoperative radiation can provide the best results for improved long-term function. New methods for radiation delivery and tumour sensitisation might provide further improvements. However, metastatic disease is common, and conventional chemotherapy provides for only a narrow therapeutic window outside of a few responsive pathological subtypes. Targeting underlying molecular events in specific sarcomas can provide for dramatic benefits, as has been seen with imatinib treatment for gastrointestinal stromal tumours and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Trials of agents targeting the cell cycle and angiogenesis in soft-tissue sarcomas, and of those targeting osteoclasts in bone sarcomas, are currently underway. Biological data and preclinical studies support trials using inhibitors of hedgehog signalling in chondrosarcoma, inhibitors of wnt/beta-catenin in osteosarcoma and aggressive fibromatosis, and inhibitors of histone deacetylases in synovial sarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. Pharmacogenetic approaches will be needed to identify individual determinants of response and outcome in order to maximise the benefits of targeting specific molecular events and keep side-effects to a minimum.

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma as a secondary malignancy in pediatric sarcoma.,Journal of pediatric surgery,J. Pediatr. Surg.,2007-07-01,"Children diagnosed with osteosarcoma (OS) and Ewing sarcoma (ES) have greatly benefited from the addition of alkylator therapy. However, with greater numbers of long-term survivors, the rising incidence of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMNs) is concerning. Herein we report on 2 patients with sarcoma who developed a case of secondary mucoepidermoid carcinoma after chemotherapy treatment without associated radiation therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first series of mucoepidermoid carcinomas arising in pediatric patients treated for sarcoma without radiotherapy. Long-term survivors of OS and ES currently undergoing routine follow-up care were reviewed and noted for the development of a new secondary malignancy. Details of their initial evaluation, previous therapies, resection techniques, pathologic findings, and follow-up compose this report. Two patients, a 17-year-old adolescent boy with OS and 16-year-old adolescent girl with ES, with secondary mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the parotid gland were identified. Both patients underwent primary resection and chemotherapy including alkylating agents, but neither received radiation. The mucoepidermoid carcinomas developed 27 months and 132 months after completion of therapy, respectively, and were noted on routine yearly follow-up. Fine-needle aspiration was nondiagnostic on each, and parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve was performed. Pathology revealed low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma with tumor extending to the deep margins for both lesions, and radiotherapy to the parotid bed was administered. There were no surgical complications. One patient is alive, without evidence of recurrent mucoepidermoid carcinoma after 4 years; the other recently completed radiotherapy and is disease-free after 12 months. Primary mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the parotid gland accounts for less than 10% of all head and neck tumors in childhood. Previous series of secondary mucoepidermoid carcinoma have demonstrated an increased risk in patients with leukemia/lymphoma. This is the first reported series of parotid mucoepidermoid carcinomas occurring after sarcoma treatment without radiotherapy.

Of 72 eligible patients, 22 (31%) were enrolled and managed in Santiago, without travel to Memphis. Pathology specimens and imaging material were centrally reviewed at St. Jude. Patients received 12 intensive courses of systemic chemotherapy with hematopoietic growth factor support over 35 weeks, and amputation or limb-salvage surgery as indicated for local control. The sponsor assisted the partner site to establish a clinical research infrastructure and obtain hematopoietic growth factor. Communication among medical and nursing teams was maintained throughout the study. Patient-care and protocol issues were discussed frequently between the two centers via scheduled videoconferences and electronic communications. Auditors monitored appropriate study conduct at the international site. No major discrepancies were identified in histologic findings, staging, or imaging studies. Preliminary results demonstrated similar outcome and treatment tolerance; the 2-year event-free survival estimate was 78.5% (95% CI, 51-100%) for patients treated at CMH (median follow-up, 1.6 years) and 74.3% (95% CI, 62-87%) for patients treated at St. Jude (median follow-up, 4 years).

To determine whether the addition of muramyl tripeptide (MTP) to chemotherapy enhances event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival in newly diagnosed patients with osteosarcoma. Six hundred sixty-two patients with osteosarcoma without clinically detectable metastatic disease and whose disease was considered resectable received one of four prospectively randomized treatments. All patients received identical cumulative doses of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate and underwent definitive surgical resection of primary tumor. Patients were randomly assigned to receive or not to receive ifosfamide and/or MTP in a 2 x 2 factorial design. The primary end points for analysis were EFS and overall survival. In the current analysis, there was no evidence of interaction, and we were able to examine each intervention separately. The chemotherapy regimens resulted in similar EFS and overall survival. There was a trend toward better EFS with the addition of MTP (P = .08). The addition of MTP to chemotherapy improved 6-year overall survival from 70% to 78% (P = .03). The hazard ratio for overall survival with the addition of MTP was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.96). The addition of ifosfamide to cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate did not enhance EFS or overall survival for patients with osteosarcoma.

Mutations in the neutral sphingomyelinase gene SMPD3 implicate the ceramide pathway in human leukemias.,Blood,Blood,2008-02-25,"Ceramide is a lipid second messenger derived from the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by sphingomyelinases (SMases) and implicated in diverse cellular responses, including growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis. Defects in the neutral SMase (nSMase) gene Smpd3, the primary regulator of ceramide biosynthesis, are responsible for developmental defects of bone; regulation of ceramide levels have been implicated in macrophage differentiation, but this pathway has not been directly implicated in human cancer. In a genomic screen for gene copy losses contributing to tumorigenesis in a mouse osteosarcoma model, we identified a somatic homozygous deletion specifically targeting Smpd3. Reconstitution of SMPD3 expression in mouse tumor cells lacking the endogenous gene enhanced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced reduction of cell viability. Nucleotide sequencing of the highly conserved SMPD3 gene in a large panel of human cancers revealed mutations in 5 (5%) of 92 acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) and 8 (6%) of 131 acute lymphoid leukemias (ALLs), but not in other tumor types.

Platelet-derived growth factor receptor as a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target for imatinib mesylate therapy in osteosarcoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2008-05-01,"The purpose of this review was to determine whether imatinib mesylate (STI571, Gleevec) has a role in the treatment of osteosarcoma. The expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor and its ligand was examined in a panel of surgical specimens obtained from 54 osteosarcoma patients, and then the expression was compared with prognosis. The effects of imatinib mesylate on growth and molecular events in 10 patient-derived osteosarcoma cell cultures were investigated. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated frequent expression of PDGF-AA (80.4%) and PDGF-alpha receptor (79.6%) and their correlation with inferior event-free survival (P < .05). PDGF-B-B and PDGF-beta-receptor expressions were also frequent (75.4% and 86%, respectively); however, statistically significant inferior event-free survival was not demonstrated (P = .15). In vitro studies demonstrated that imatinib mesylate had a variable cytotoxic effect on various osteosarcoma primary cultures, with an IC(50) of 5.6 microM to 9.5 microM, and blocked the PDGF-induced intracellular signal transduction as well as inhibition of downstream Akt phosphorylation. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was constitutively activated despite PDGF stimulation and imatinib mesylate treatment in 7 of 10 osteosarcoma cultures, perhaps explaining uncontrolled proliferation and relative unresponsiveness to imatinib. Imatinib mesylate could not be viewed as having a role as a single agent at current conventional doses for the treatment of osteosarcoma. These findings predicted activity in osteosarcoma clinical trials and suggested that in vitro model systems predict clinical behavior and that PDGF and its receptor expression could potentially be used for determining prognosis of osteosarcoma.",Journal Article,4282.0,85.0,The purpose of this review was to determine whether imatinib mesylate STI571 Gleevec has a role in the treatment of The expression of platelet-derived growth factor PDGF receptor and its ligand was examined in a panel of surgical specimens obtained from 54 patients and then the expression was compared with prognosis The effects of imatinib mesylate on growth and molecular events in 10 patient-derived cell cultures were investigated Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated frequent expression of PDGF-AA 80.4 and PDGF-alpha receptor 79.6 and their correlation with inferior event-free survival P .05 PDGF-B-B and PDGF-beta-receptor expressions were also frequent 75.4 and 86 respectively however statistically significant inferior event-free survival was not demonstrated P .15 In vitro studies demonstrated that imatinib mesylate had a variable cytotoxic effect on various primary cultures with an IC 50 of 5.6 microM to 9.5 microM and blocked the PDGF-induced intracellular signal transduction as well as inhibition of downstream Akt phosphorylation Mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK was constitutively activated despite PDGF stimulation and imatinib mesylate treatment in 7 of 10 cultures perhaps explaining uncontrolled proliferation and relative unresponsiveness to imatinib Imatinib mesylate could not be viewed as having a role as a single agent at current conventional doses for the treatment of These findings predicted activity in clinical trials and suggested that in vitro model systems predict clinical behavior and that PDGF and its receptor expression could potentially be used for determining prognosis of,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 743, 1, 26, 206, 10, 6, 223, 317, 577, 2347, 5735, 8569, 71, 8, 200, 4, 3, 24, 1, 3, 55, 1, 1596, 526, 129, 161, 4546, 153, 2, 211, 1232, 10, 409, 4, 8, 993, 1, 221, 623, 683, 29, 667, 7, 2, 818, 3, 55, 10, 72, 5, 356, 3, 176, 1, 577, 2347, 23, 129, 2, 219, 281, 4, 79, 69, 526, 31, 3231, 11, 565, 1382, 94, 264, 908, 55, 1, 4546, 1519, 493, 39, 2, 4546, 950, 153, 842, 49, 2, 136, 816, 5, 1663, 774, 115, 25, 19, 474, 4546, 132, 132, 2, 4546, 1090, 153, 4249, 11, 120, 908, 481, 39, 2, 868, 106, 137, 712, 93, 1663, 774, 115, 25, 10, 44, 264, 19, 167, 4, 439, 94, 264, 17, 577, 2347, 42, 8, 1347, 759, 254, 23, 747, 86, 3231, 5, 35, 2340, 212, 1, 33, 49, 3550, 6, 83, 33, 3550, 2, 2582, 3, 4546, 277, 2087, 1235, 2761, 22, 149, 22, 297, 1, 1489, 649, 982, 2625, 735, 178, 216, 1748, 10, 2818, 735, 550, 4546, 2503, 2, 577, 2347, 24, 4, 67, 1, 79, 3231, 4434, 8290, 6180, 457, 2, 580, 18217, 6, 577, 577, 2347, 359, 44, 40, 7879, 22, 1041, 8, 200, 22, 8, 226, 420, 28, 291, 809, 415, 9, 3, 24, 1, 46, 272, 783, 128, 4, 38, 143, 2, 1148, 17, 4, 439, 202, 1530, 678, 38, 1710, 2, 17, 4546, 2, 211, 153, 55, 359, 751, 40, 95, 9, 2196, 356, 1]",1629.0,18338812,254

"Cell cycle regulator gene CDC5L, a potential target for 6p12-p21 amplicon in osteosarcoma.",Molecular cancer research : MCR,Mol. Cancer Res.,2008-06-01,"Osteosarcoma is a primary malignant tumor of bone arising from primitive bone-forming mesenchymal cells and accounts for approximately 60% of malignant bone tumors. Our comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) studies have identified frequent amplification at 6p12-p21, 12q13-q15, and 17p11.2 in osteosarcoma. Of these amplified regions, 6p12-p21 is particularly interesting because of its association with progression and poor prognosis in patients with osteosarcoma. In an attempt to identify aberrantly expressed gene(s) mapping to the 6p12-p21 amplicon, a region-specific array was generated using 108 overlapping BAC and P1 clones covering a 28.8-Mb region at 0.26-Mb intervals. Based on array CGH analysis, the 6p amplicon was refined to 7.9 Mb between the clones RP11-91E11 and RP1-244F2 and 10 amplified clones, with possible target genes, were identified. To study the expression pattern of the target genes from the hotspot amplicon and known candidate genes from 6p12-21, we did quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis of MAPK14, MAPK13, CDKN1A, PIM1, MDGA1, BTB9, DNAH8, CCND3, PTK7, CDC5L, and RUNX2 on osteosarcoma patient samples and seven cell lines. The combined array CGH and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis identified amplification and overexpression of CDC5L, CCND3, and RUNX2.

Surgical management of primary and metastatic sarcoma of the mobile spine.,Journal of neurosurgery. Spine,J Neurosurg Spine,2008-08-01,"Sarcomas of the spine are a challenging problem due to their frequent and extensive involvement of multiple spinal segments and high recurrence rates. Gross-total resection to negative margins, with preservation of neurological function and palliation of pain, is the surgical goal and may be achieved using either intralesional resection or en bloc excision. The authors report outcomes of surgery for primary and metastatic sarcomas of the mobile spine in a large patient series. A retrospective review of patients undergoing resection for sarcomas of the mobile spine between 1993 and 2005 was undertaken. Sarcomas were classified by histology study results and as either primary or metastatic. Details of the surgical approach, levels of involvement, and operative complications were recorded. Outcome measures included neurological function, palliation of pain, local recurrence, and overall survival. Eighty patients underwent 110 resections of either primary or metastatic sarcomas of the mobile spine. Twenty-nine lesions were primary sarcomas (36%) and 51 were metastatic sarcomas (64%). Intralesional resections were performed in 98 surgeries (89%) and en bloc resections were performed in 12 (11%). Median survival from surgery for all patients was 20.6 months. Median survival for patients with a primary sarcoma of the spine was 40.2 months and was 17.3 months for patients with a metastatic sarcoma. Predictors of improved survival included a chondrosarcoma histological type and a better preoperative functional status, whereas osteosarcoma and a high-grade tumor were negative influences on survival. Multivariate analysis showed that only a high-grade tumor was an independent predictor of shorter overall survival. American Spinal Injury Association scale grades were maintained or improved in 97% of patients postoperatively, and there was a significant decrease in pain scores postoperatively. No significant differences in survival or local recurrence rates between intralesional or en bloc resections for either primary or metastatic spine sarcomas were found. Surgery for primary or metastatic sarcoma of the spine is associated with an improvement in neurological function and palliation of pain. The results of this study show a significant difference in patient survival for primary versus metastatic spine sarcomas. The results do not show a statistically significant benefit in survival or local recurrence rates for en bloc versus intralesional resections for either metastatic or primary sarcomas of the spine, but this may be due to the small number of patients undergoing en bloc resections.",Journal Article,4190.0,44.0,Sarcomas of the spine are a challenging problem due to their frequent and extensive involvement of multiple spinal segments and high recurrence rates Gross-total resection to negative margins with preservation of neurological function and palliation of pain is the surgical goal and may be achieved using either intralesional resection or en bloc excision The authors report outcomes of surgery for primary and metastatic sarcomas of the mobile spine in a large patient series A retrospective review of patients undergoing resection for sarcomas of the mobile spine between 1993 and 2005 was undertaken Sarcomas were classified by histology study results and as either primary or metastatic Details of the surgical approach levels of involvement and operative complications were recorded Outcome measures included neurological function palliation of pain local recurrence and overall survival Eighty patients underwent 110 resections of either primary or metastatic sarcomas of the mobile spine Twenty-nine lesions were primary sarcomas 36 and 51 were metastatic sarcomas 64 Intralesional resections were performed in 98 surgeries 89 and en bloc resections were performed in 12 11 Median survival from surgery for all patients was 20.6 months Median survival for patients with a primary of the spine was 40.2 months and was 17.3 months for patients with a metastatic Predictors of improved survival included a chondrosarcoma histological type and a better preoperative functional status whereas and a high-grade tumor were negative influences on survival Multivariate analysis showed that only a high-grade tumor was an independent predictor of shorter overall survival American Spinal Injury Association scale grades were maintained or improved in 97 of patients postoperatively and there was a significant decrease in pain scores postoperatively No significant differences in survival or local recurrence rates between intralesional or en bloc resections for either primary or metastatic spine sarcomas were found Surgery for primary or metastatic of the spine is associated with an improvement in neurological function and palliation of pain The results of this study show a significant difference in patient survival for primary versus metastatic spine sarcomas The results do not show a statistically significant benefit in survival or local recurrence rates for en bloc versus intralesional resections for either metastatic or primary sarcomas of the spine but this may be due to the small number of patients undergoing en bloc resections,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1479, 1, 3, 2342, 32, 8, 1950, 2497, 520, 6, 136, 908, 2, 1344, 799, 1, 232, 1499, 5138, 2, 64, 146, 151, 1789, 181, 170, 6, 199, 1012, 5, 2224, 1, 3622, 343, 2, 3695, 1, 559, 16, 3, 221, 1326, 2, 68, 40, 513, 75, 361, 7549, 170, 15, 4375, 5590, 1366, 3, 738, 414, 123, 1, 152, 9, 86, 2, 113, 1479, 1, 3, 7489, 2342, 4, 8, 375, 69, 988, 8, 459, 206, 1, 7, 479, 170, 9, 1479, 1, 3, 7489, 2342, 59, 3343, 2, 1242, 10, 2789, 1479, 11, 1373, 20, 784, 45, 99, 2, 22, 361, 86, 15, 113, 3791, 1, 3, 221, 353, 148, 1, 799, 2, 1208, 521, 11, 1872, 228, 1018, 159, 3622, 343, 3695, 1, 559, 293, 146, 2, 63, 25, 2207, 7, 208, 3129, 2185, 1, 361, 86, 15, 113, 1479, 1, 3, 7489, 2342, 737, 762, 406, 11, 86, 1479, 511, 2, 725, 11, 113, 1479, 660, 7549, 2185, 11, 173, 4, 1096, 5305, 887, 2, 4375, 5590, 2185, 11, 173, 4, 133, 175, 52, 25, 29, 152, 9, 62, 7, 10, 179, 49, 53, 52, 25, 9, 7, 5, 8, 86, 1, 3, 2342, 10, 327, 18, 53, 2, 10, 269, 27, 53, 9, 7, 5, 8, 113, 674, 1, 231, 25, 159, 8, 6116, 1831, 267, 2, 8, 380, 498, 583, 156, 547, 2, 8, 64, 88, 30, 11, 199, 3859, 23, 25, 331, 65, 224, 17, 158, 8, 64, 88, 30, 10, 35, 306, 980, 1, 985, 63, 25, 597, 1499, 2730, 248, 1124, 2276, 11, 1955, 15, 231, 4, 1015, 1, 7, 3541, 2, 125, 10, 8, 93, 775, 4, 559, 703, 3541, 77, 93, 362, 4, 25, 15, 293, 146, 151, 59, 7549, 15, 4375, 5590, 2185, 9, 361, 86, 15, 113, 2342, 1479, 11, 204, 152, 9, 86, 15, 113, 1, 3, 2342, 16, 41, 5, 35, 767, 4, 3622, 343, 2, 3695, 1, 559, 3, 99, 1, 26, 45, 514, 8, 93, 523, 4, 69, 25, 9, 86, 185, 113, 2342, 1479, 3, 99, 1022, 44, 514, 8, 712, 93, 247, 4, 25, 15, 293, 146, 151, 9, 4375, 5590, 185, 7549, 2185, 9, 361, 113, 15, 86, 1479, 1, 3, 2342, 84, 26, 68, 40, 520, 6, 3, 302, 207, 1, 7, 479, 4375, 5590, 2185]",2544.0,18764743,251
Autophagy: a novel mechanism of synergistic cytotoxicity between doxorubicin and roscovitine in a sarcoma model.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2008-10-01,"Doxorubicin is a genotoxic chemotherapy agent used in treatment of a wide variety of cancers. Significant clinical side effects, including cardiac toxicity and myelosuppression, severely limit the therapeutic index of this commonly used agent and methods which improve doxorubicin efficacy could benefit many patients. Because doxorubicin cytotoxicity is cell cycle specific, the cell cycle is a rational target to enhance its efficacy. We examined the direct, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor roscovitine as a means of enhancing doxorubicin cytotoxicity. This study showed synergistic cytotoxicity between doxorubicin and roscovitine in three sarcoma cell lines: SW-982 (synovial sarcoma), U2OS-LC3-GFP (osteosarcoma), and SK-LMS-1 (uterine leiomyosarcoma), but not the fibroblast cell line WI38. The combined treatment of doxorubicin and roscovitine was associated with a prolonged G(2)-M cell cycle arrest in the three sarcoma cell lines. Using three different methods for detecting apoptosis, our results revealed that apoptotic cell death did not account for the synergistic cytotoxicity between doxorubicin and roscovitine. However, morphologic changes observed by light microscopy and increased cytoplasmic LC3-GFP puncta in U20S-LC3-GFP cells after the combined treatment suggested the induction of autophagy.

Adult survivors (n = 629) of either childhood onset osteosarcoma or Ewing's sarcoma, with a primary tumor location in the lower-extremity were identified and contacted via mail to complete an additional questionnaire. Participants completed the Reintegration into Normal Living Index (RNL) to evaluate global function (maximum score of 22), daily function (maximum score of 16) and self perception (maximum score of 6). Survivors reported high levels of global function with an adjusted mean overall RNL index score of 20.6 (SE 0.14), mean daily function score of 15.0 (SD 0.10) and mean self perception score of 5.6 (SE 0.05). While female gender and increasing age were associated with lower RNL scores, the magnitude of difference is of questionable clinical significance.

Eligible patients had osteosarcoma diagnosed and treated at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Children's Hospital Boston from January 1, 1995 to December 12, 2004, were 3-18 years of age at diagnosis, and had a normal audiogram prior to the start of chemotherapy. Patients received cisplatin according to the standard practice or current open protocol. Patients who developed hearing loss during treatment had cisplatin held on an individualized basis. Hearing function was evaluated prior to the start of therapy, before each cycle, and off-therapy. Fisher's exact test and logistic regression models were used to identify univariate and independent predictors of hearing loss, respectively. Seven out of nine patients (78%) who received cisplatin 120 mg/m(2)/day on 1 day developed hearing loss compared to 8/27 (30%) who received 60 mg/m(2)/day for 2 days (P = 0.019). Logistic regression showed that age, cumulative cisplatin dose, and administration of cisplatin 120 mg/m(2)/day were independent predictors of hearing loss.

Phase II study of high-dose photon/proton radiotherapy in the management of spine sarcomas.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2008-12-25,"Radiotherapy (XRT) for spine sarcomas is constrained by spinal cord, nerve, and viscera tolerance. Negative surgical margins are uncommon; hence, doses of >or=66 Gy are recommended. A Phase II clinical trial evaluated high-dose photon/proton XRT for spine sarcomas. Eligible patients had nonmetastatic, thoracic, lumbar, and/or sacral spine/paraspinal sarcomas. Treatment included pre- and/or postoperative photon/proton XRT with or without radical resection; patients with osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma received chemotherapy. Shrinking fields delivered 50.4 cobalt Gray equivalent (Gy RBE) to subclinical disease, 70.2 Gy RBE to microscopic disease in the tumor bed, and 77.4 Gy RBE to gross disease at 1.8 Gy RBE qd. Doses were reduced for radiosensitive histologies, concurrent chemoradiation, or when diabetes or autoimmune disease present. Spinal cord dose was limited to 63/54 Gy RBE to surface/center. Intraoperative boost doses of 7.5 to 10 Gy could be given by dural plaque. A total of 50 patients (29 chordoma, 14 chondrosarcoma, 7 other) underwent gross total (n = 25) or subtotal (n = 12) resection or biopsy (n = 13). With 48 month median follow-up, 5-year actuarial local control, recurrence-free survival, and overall survival are: 78%, 63%, and 87% respectively. Two of 36 (5.6%) patients treated for primary versus 7/14 (50%) for recurrent tumor developed local recurrence (p < 0.001).

"Combination short-course preoperative irradiation, surgical resection, and reduced-field high-dose postoperative irradiation in the treatment of tumors involving the bone.","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2009-01-01,"To assess the feasibility and outcomes of combination short-course preoperative radiation, resection, and reduced-field (tumor bed without operative field coverage) high-dose postoperative radiation for patients with solid tumors mainly involving the spine and pelvis. Between 1982 and 2006, a total of 48 patients were treated using this treatment strategy for solid tumors involving bone. Radiation treatments used both photons and protons. Of those treated, 52% had chordoma, 31% had chondrosarcoma, 8% had osteosarcoma, and 4% had Ewing's sarcoma, with 71% involving the pelvis/sacrum and 21% elsewhere in the spine. Median preoperative dose was 20 Gy, with a median of 50.4 Gy postoperatively. With 31.8-month median follow-up, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate is 65%; 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate, 53.8%; and 5-year local control (LC) rate, 72%. There were no significant differences in OS, DFS, and LC according to histologic characteristics. Between primary and recurrent disease, there was no significant difference in OS rates (74.4% vs. 51.4%, respectively; p = 0.128), in contrast to DFS (71.5% vs. 18.3%; p = 0.0014) and LC rates (88.9% vs. 30.9%; p = 0.0011) favoring primary disease. After resection, 10 patients experienced delayed wound healing that did not significantly impact on OS, DFS, or LC. This approach is promising for patients with bone sarcomas in which resection will likely yield close/positive margins. It appears to inhibit tumor seeding with an acceptable rate of wound-healing complications. Dose escalation is accomplished without high-dose preoperative radiation (likely associated with higher rates of acute wound healing delays) or large-field postoperative radiation only (likely associated with late normal tissue toxicity).

Predictors of inactive lifestyle among adult survivors of childhood cancer: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,Cancer,Cancer,2009-05-01,": Participation in physical activity is important for childhood cancer survivors, because inactivity may compound cancer/treatment-related late effects. However, some survivors may have difficulty participating in physical activity, and these individuals need to be identified so that risk-based guidelines for physical activity, tailored to specific needs, can be developed and implemented. The objectives of the current study were to document physical activity patterns in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) cohort, to compare the physical activity patterns with siblings in the CCSS and with a population-based sample from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and to evaluate associations between diagnosis, treatment, and personal factors in terms of the risk for an inactive lifestyle. : Percentages of participation in recommended physical activity were compared among survivors, siblings, and population norms. Generalized linear models were used to evaluate the associations between cancer diagnosis and therapy, sociodemographics, and the risk for an inactive lifestyle. : Participants included 9301 adult survivors of childhood cancer and 2886 siblings. Survivors were less likely than siblings (46% vs 52%) to meet physical activity guidelines and were more likely than siblings to report an inactive lifestyle (23% vs 14%). Medulloblastoma (35%) and osteosarcoma (27%) survivors reported the highest levels of inactive lifestyle. Treatments with cranial radiation or amputation were associated with an inactive lifestyle as were being a woman, black race, older age, lower educational attainment, underweight or obese status, smoking, and depression. : Childhood cancer survivors were less active than a sibling comparison group or an age- and sex-matched population sample. Survivors who are at risk for an inactive lifestyle should be considered high priority for developing and testing of intervention approaches. Cancer 2009.

Effect of time to resumption of chemotherapy after definitive surgery on prognosis for non-metastatic osteosarcoma.,The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume,J Bone Joint Surg Am,2009-03-01,"The dose intensity of chemotherapy has been described as affecting the outcome of the treatment of a number of different types of tumors. A delay in the resumption of chemotherapy after definitive surgery for the treatment of osteosarcoma can decrease the overall dose intensity. The goal of this study was to assess the prognostic significance of the time to resumption of chemotherapy after definitive surgery in patients with localized osteosarcoma in an extremity. The relationships of the time between definitive surgery and resumption of chemotherapy with death and adverse events in 703 patients with a localized resectable osteosarcoma in an extremity (556 treated in the Children's Oncology Group [COG] Study [INT 0133] and 147 treated at five tertiary care cancer centers) were assessed with use of Cox proportional hazards models. The twenty-fifth, fiftieth, and seventy-fifth percentiles of time from definitive surgery to resumption of chemotherapy were twelve, sixteen, and twenty-one days, respectively. Overall survival was poorer for patients who had had a delay of greater than twenty-one days before the resumption of chemotherapy compared with those who had had a shorter delay (hazard ratio = 1.57 [95% confidence interval = 1.04 to 2.36]; p = 0.03). Of seventy-one COG-study patients with postoperative complications, 32% (twenty-three) had a delay of more than twenty-one days before resumption of chemotherapy, but 20% (eighty-nine) of 444 patients with no complications had a similar delay.

Phase II multicenter trial of imatinib in 10 histologic subtypes of sarcoma using a bayesian hierarchical statistical model.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-05-18,"PURPOSE The purpose of this trial was to assess the efficacy of imatinib in patients with one of 10 different subtypes of advanced sarcoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS Eligible patients were treated daily with imatinib dosed at 300 mg twice a day (for body-surface area > or = 1.5 m(2)). The primary end point was response (clinical benefit response [CBR]), defined as complete (CR) or partial response (PR) at 2 months, or stable disease, CR, or PR at 4 months. Rules for early termination within each disease type were based on a Bayesian hierarchical probability model (BHM) accounting for correlation of the responses of the 10 subtypes. Available tissue samples were analyzed for molecules within the KIT/platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) signal transduction pathway. Results One hundred eighty-five assessable patients with one of 10 subtypes of sarcoma were treated. One CR and three PRs were achieved. A CBR was achieved in 28 patients treated overall and by subtype: two angiosarcomas (n = 16), 0 Ewing (n = 13), one fibrosarcoma (n = 12), six leiomyosarcomas (n = 29), seven liposarcomas (n = 31), three malignant fibrous histiocytomas (n = 30), five osteosarcomas (n = 27), one malignant peripheral-nerve sheath tumor (n = 7), 0 rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 2), and three synovial sarcomas (n = 22). Variable expression and mutations within the KIT/PDGFR pathway were observed. CONCLUSION This is the first phase II study of a new agent in sarcoma to include sufficient patients with each of the common histologic subtypes to permit generalizable conclusions. The BHM is an effective method for studying rare diseases and their subtypes, when it is reasonable to assume that their response rates are exchangeable. Although rare dramatic responses were seen, imatinib is not an active agent in advanced sarcoma in these subtypes.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",3900.0,126.0,PURPOSE The purpose of this trial was to assess the efficacy of imatinib in patients with one of 10 different subtypes of advanced PATIENTS AND METHODS Eligible patients were treated daily with imatinib dosed at 300 mg twice a day for body-surface area or 1.5 m 2 The primary end point was response clinical benefit response CBR defined as complete CR or partial response PR at 2 months or stable disease CR or PR at 4 months Rules for early termination within each disease type were based on a Bayesian hierarchical probability model BHM accounting for correlation of the responses of the 10 subtypes Available tissue samples were analyzed for molecules within the KIT/platelet-derived growth factor receptor PDGFR signal transduction pathway Results One hundred eighty-five assessable patients with one of 10 subtypes of were treated One CR and three PRs were achieved A CBR was achieved in 28 patients treated overall and by subtype two angiosarcomas n 16 0 n 13 one fibrosarcoma n 12 six leiomyosarcomas n 29 seven liposarcomas n 31 three malignant fibrous histiocytomas n 30 five osteosarcomas n 27 one malignant peripheral-nerve sheath tumor n 7 0 n 2 and three synovial sarcomas n 22 Variable expression and mutations within the KIT/PDGFR pathway were observed CONCLUSION This is the first phase II study of a new agent in to include sufficient patients with each of the common histologic subtypes to permit generalizable conclusions The BHM is an effective method for studying rare diseases and their subtypes when it is reasonable to assume that their response rates are exchangeable Although rare dramatic responses were seen imatinib is not an active agent in advanced in these subtypes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[743, 3, 743, 1, 26, 160, 10, 6, 423, 3, 209, 1, 577, 4, 7, 5, 104, 1, 79, 338, 814, 1, 131, 7, 2, 636, 625, 7, 11, 73, 391, 5, 577, 6268, 28, 2036, 81, 936, 8, 218, 9, 642, 1255, 965, 15, 14, 33, 188, 18, 3, 86, 396, 741, 10, 51, 38, 247, 51, 6222, 395, 22, 236, 684, 15, 450, 51, 998, 28, 18, 53, 15, 585, 34, 684, 15, 998, 28, 39, 53, 8679, 9, 191, 7202, 262, 296, 34, 267, 11, 90, 23, 8, 5032, 4466, 1320, 202, 45547, 3116, 9, 816, 1, 3, 253, 1, 3, 79, 814, 390, 246, 347, 11, 311, 9, 1598, 262, 3, 1164, 1596, 526, 129, 161, 153, 4103, 1235, 2761, 308, 99, 104, 1128, 2207, 365, 3120, 7, 5, 104, 1, 79, 814, 1, 11, 73, 104, 684, 2, 169, 4018, 11, 513, 8, 6222, 10, 513, 4, 339, 7, 73, 63, 2, 20, 875, 100, 9397, 78, 245, 13, 78, 233, 104, 8378, 78, 133, 437, 6857, 78, 462, 648, 7880, 78, 456, 169, 393, 5870, 27979, 78, 201, 365, 11089, 78, 428, 104, 393, 672, 2476, 7280, 30, 78, 67, 13, 78, 18, 2, 169, 5043, 1479, 78, 350, 1347, 55, 2, 138, 262, 3, 1164, 4103, 308, 11, 164, 1221, 26, 16, 3, 157, 124, 215, 45, 1, 8, 217, 420, 4, 6, 643, 1952, 7, 5, 296, 1, 3, 186, 884, 814, 6, 5634, 12313, 2130, 3, 45547, 16, 35, 323, 596, 9, 4559, 622, 1342, 2, 136, 814, 198, 192, 16, 3203, 6, 16661, 17, 136, 51, 151, 32, 33374, 242, 622, 3079, 253, 11, 527, 577, 16, 44, 35, 544, 420, 4, 131, 4, 46, 814]",1697.0,19451433,94
Risk of local recurrence after deltoid-sparing resection for osteosarcoma of the proximal humerus.,Cancer,Cancer,2009-08-01,"The anatomy of the shoulder poses special challenges with regard to limb-sparing surgery. Resection of the deltoid muscle is considered by some surgeons to be necessary to achieve adequate margins for osteosarcoma of the proximal humerus. However, this can compromise the functional results after reconstruction of the shoulder. The goal of the current study was to determine whether deltoid-sparing resection can be safely performed for osteosarcoma of the proximal humerus. Between 1978 and 2005, 23 consecutive patients with high-grade nonmetastatic osteosarcoma of the proximal humerus underwent limb-sparing surgery with preservation of the deltoid muscle. All patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and postoperative chemotherapy. The mean follow-up was 90 months (range, 7 months-279 months). The overall survival at 5 years was 77%. At the time of last follow-up, 14 (61%) of 23 of patients were alive without evidence of disease. Three (13%) patients developed local recurrence. Two of these patients had poor responses to chemotherapy, with tumor necrosis of 50% and 70%. The third patient had a pathologic fracture of the humerus. Positive surgical margins were associated with local recurrence, and 2 of 4 patients with a positive surgical margin developed local recurrence (P = .01). Preservation of the deltoid muscle can be performed for carefully selected patients with osteosarcoma of the proximal humerus. Routine use of the procedure is not justified, because it may be associated with an elevated risk of recurrence.

The role of angiocidin in sarcomas.,Cancer,Cancer,2009-11-01,"Angiocidin, first identified as a tumor-associated thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) receptor, is a key mediator of tumor progression. TSP-1, an extracellular protein produced by stromal cells, up-regulates gelatinases and tumor cell invasion in epithelial malignancies. The authors recently developed 2 angiocidin-inhibitory peptides that block angiocidin-TSP-1 binding. They hypothesized that angiocidin mediates increased gelatinase expression and tumor cell invasion in sarcomas through its interaction with TSP-1. Angiocidin, TSP-1, and gelatinase expression was evaluated in low-grade and high-grade sarcoma specimens. The authors established 3 distinct cell lines from a patient with an extraskeletal osteosarcoma: EXOS-N (normal mesenchymal), EXOS-P (primary osteosarcoma), and EXOS-M (lung metastasis). Each was evaluated for angiocidin, gelatinase, and gelatinase inhibitor (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase) expression and for invasive capacity. Their responsiveness to TSP-1 was determined. The role of angiocidin in up-regulating gelatinase expression and invasion was studied using the authors' angiocidin-inhibitory peptides. Expression of angiocidin, TSP-1, and gelatinases correlated with tumor grade. Angiocidin expression, gelatinase activity, and invasiveness in the EXOS cell lines correlated with phenotype; EXOS-N cells did not express angiocidin or gelatinases and were not invasive; EXOS-M cells were 5 times more invasive than EXOS-P cells and exhibited greater angiocidin and gelatinase expression. EXOS cell gelatinase activity and invasiveness increased 4- to 5-fold in response to TSP-1. Inhibition of angiocidin with the authors' inhibitory peptides blocked TSP-1-promoted increases in gelatinase activity and tumor cell invasion.

Addition of muramyl tripeptide to chemotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed metastatic osteosarcoma: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.,Cancer,Cancer,2009-11-01,"The addition of liposomal muramyl tripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine (MTP-PE) to chemotherapy has been shown to improve overall survival in patients with nonmetastatic osteosarcoma (OS). The authors report the results of addition of liposomal MTP-PE to chemotherapy for patients with metastatic OS. Intergroup-0133 was a prospective randomized phase 3 trial for the treatment of newly diagnosed patients with OS. The authors compared 3-drug chemotherapy with cisplatin, doxorubicin, and high-dose methotrexate (Regimen A) to the same 3 drugs with the addition of ifosfamide (Regimen B). The addition of liposomal MTP-PE to chemotherapy was evaluated. Five-year event-free survival (EFS) for patients who received liposomal MTP-PE (n = 46) was 42% versus 26% for those who did not (n = 45) (relative risk for liposomal MTP-PE, 0.72; P = .23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42-1.2).

Insulin-like growth factor-I receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor cyclolignan picropodophyllin inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in multidrug resistant osteosarcoma cell lines.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2009-07-28,"Insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) is an important mediator of tumor cell survival and shows prognostic significance in sarcoma. To explore potential therapeutic strategies for interrupting signaling through this pathway, we assessed the ability of cyclolignan picropodophyllin (PPP), a member of the cyclolignan family, to selectively inhibit the receptor tyrosine kinase activity of IGF-IR in several sarcoma cell line model systems. Of the diverse sarcoma subtypes studied, osteosarcoma cell lines were found to be particularly sensitive to IGF-IR inhibition, including several multidrug resistant osteosarcoma cell lines with documented resistance to various conventional anticancer drugs. PPP shows relatively little toxicity in human osteoblast cell lines when compared with osteosarcoma cell lines. These studies show that PPP significantly inhibits IGF-IR expression and activation in both chemotherapy-sensitive and chemotherapy-resistant osteosarcoma cell lines. This inhibition of the IGF-IR pathway correlates with suppression of proliferation of osteosarcoma cell lines and with apoptosis induction as measured by monitoring of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and its cleavage product and by quantitative measurement of apoptosis-associated CK18Asp396. Importantly, PPP increases the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin in doxorubicin-resistant osteosarcoma cell lines U-2OS(MR) and KHOS(MR). Furthermore, small interfering RNA down-regulation of IGF-IR expression in drug-resistant cell lines also caused resensitization to doxorubicin. Our data suggest that inhibition of IGF-IR with PPP offers a novel and selective therapeutic strategy for ostosarcoma, and at the same time, PPP is effective at reversing the drug-resistant phenotype in osteosarcoma cell lines.",Journal Article,3829.0,61.0,Insulin-like growth factor-I receptor IGF-IR is an important mediator of tumor cell survival and shows prognostic significance in To explore potential therapeutic strategies for interrupting signaling through this pathway we assessed the ability of cyclolignan picropodophyllin PPP a member of the cyclolignan family to selectively inhibit the receptor tyrosine kinase activity of IGF-IR in several cell line model systems Of the diverse subtypes studied cell lines were found to be particularly sensitive to IGF-IR inhibition including several multidrug resistant cell lines with documented resistance to various conventional anticancer drugs PPP shows relatively little toxicity in human osteoblast cell lines when compared with cell lines These studies show that PPP significantly inhibits IGF-IR expression and activation in both chemotherapy-sensitive and chemotherapy-resistant cell lines This inhibition of the IGF-IR pathway correlates with suppression of proliferation of cell lines and with apoptosis induction as measured by monitoring of poly ADP-ribose polymerase and its cleavage product and by quantitative measurement of apoptosis-associated CK18Asp396 Importantly PPP increases the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin in doxorubicin-resistant cell lines U-2OS MR and KHOS MR Furthermore small interfering RNA down-regulation of IGF-IR expression in drug-resistant cell lines also caused resensitization to doxorubicin Our data suggest that inhibition of IGF-IR with PPP offers a novel and selective therapeutic strategy for ostosarcoma and at the same time PPP is effective at reversing the drug-resistant phenotype in cell lines,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1601, 733, 129, 161, 70, 153, 1273, 2123, 16, 35, 305, 3810, 1, 30, 31, 25, 2, 1949, 177, 724, 4, 6, 1645, 174, 189, 422, 9, 17164, 314, 298, 26, 308, 21, 275, 3, 801, 1, 45629, 58105, 16951, 8, 2693, 1, 3, 45629, 607, 6, 2382, 1433, 3, 153, 564, 216, 128, 1, 1273, 2123, 4, 392, 31, 328, 202, 1530, 1, 3, 1867, 814, 656, 31, 285, 11, 204, 6, 40, 823, 745, 6, 1273, 2123, 297, 141, 392, 4814, 436, 31, 285, 5, 1405, 251, 6, 747, 809, 1475, 600, 16951, 1949, 1352, 1215, 155, 4, 171, 7418, 31, 285, 198, 72, 5, 31, 285, 46, 94, 514, 17, 16951, 97, 1576, 1273, 2123, 55, 2, 363, 4, 110, 56, 745, 2, 56, 436, 31, 285, 26, 297, 1, 3, 1273, 2123, 308, 1871, 5, 1332, 1, 457, 1, 31, 285, 2, 5, 351, 504, 22, 644, 20, 1315, 1, 2699, 3638, 3507, 1451, 2, 211, 3155, 2821, 2, 20, 1156, 2204, 1, 351, 41, 58106, 1859, 16951, 1106, 3, 759, 176, 1, 856, 4, 856, 436, 31, 285, 1767, 23779, 1638, 2, 26853, 1638, 798, 302, 3449, 893, 1328, 863, 1, 1273, 2123, 55, 4, 234, 436, 31, 285, 120, 1546, 28930, 6, 856, 114, 74, 309, 17, 297, 1, 1273, 2123, 5, 16951, 2339, 8, 229, 2, 1094, 189, 692, 9, 58107, 2, 28, 3, 827, 98, 16951, 16, 323, 28, 9953, 3, 234, 436, 1005, 4, 31, 285]",1643.0,19638450,139

Oncol.,2009-11-01,"Therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (t-MDS/AML) is a long-term complication of pediatric cancer. We retrospectively studied pediatric t-MDS/AML patients treated at MD Anderson from 1975 to 2007. We also compared those patients to pediatric patients with de novo MDS/AML during this time interval. Among 2589 children with cancer treated at MD Anderson, we identified 22 patients with t-MDS/AML. Patients with t-MDS/AML had a median age of 14 years. There was a male and Hispanic predominance. The most common primary malignancies were osteosarcoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. The median latency period was 4.1 years. Three patients received supportive care only. Group 1 (n=5) underwent stem cell transplantation without induction chemotherapy. Group 2 (n=5) patients received AML-type chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant postremission (n=5). Group 3 (n=4) received a stem cell transplant as salvage therapy. The respective 2-year survival rates for groups 1, 2, and 3 were 20%, 40%, and 25% (P=0.85). Patients with de novo AML were younger (P=0.001) and higher rates of complete remission (P=0.03), and survival (P<0.0001).

Ewing and osteogenic sarcoma: evidence for multidisciplinary management.,Spine,Spine,2009-10-01,"Systematic review of the literature and consensus recommendations by an international expert focus group. To review and classify evidence in the literature regarding: (1) the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and (2) impact of extent of surgical resection on clinical outcome, particularly survival and local control, in patients with spinal Ewing sarcoma (ES) and osteosarcoma (OS). ES and OS of the spine are currently managed with multimodality treatment involving chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgical resection. It is currently unclear if extent of resection, for example, intralesional resection versus marginal or wide resection has an impact on survival or local control of disease. A systematic literature search for the years 1960 to 2008 was performed looking at publications involving treatment of spinal ES and OS. From these 208 articles, 16 were selected for analysis and were reviewed in depth. Studies were presented to a group of spinal oncology experts. Literature was graded for quality, summarized and presented to an international expert group with consensus recommendations generated. For ES of the spine, 10 studies were analyzed. For OS of the spine, 6 studies were analyzed. For both ES and OS of the spine, moderate level evidence supported a strong recommendation that neoadjuvant chemotherapy offers significant improvements in local control and long-term survival and is essential in multimodality management. For spinal ES, very low level evidence supported a weak recommendation that en bloc surgical resection provides improved local control, but not improved overall survival. Radiation therapy for spinal ES may also be used for local control either alone or to supplement incomplete resection. For spinal OS, very low evidence supported a strong recommendation that en bloc resection provides improved local control and potentially improved overall survival. Patients with ES and OS are currently managed with multiple modalities involving surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. For both histopathologies, advances in chemotherapy have led to the greatest improvements in survival over the last few decades. Neoadjuvant therapy portents the most favorable local control and long-term survival. En bloc surgical resection may improve overall survival and decrease risk of recurrence.",Journal Article,3764.0,52.0,Systematic review of the literature and consensus recommendations by an international expert focus group To review and classify evidence in the literature regarding 1 the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 2 impact of extent of surgical resection on clinical outcome particularly survival and local control in patients with spinal ES and OS ES and OS of the spine are currently managed with multimodality treatment involving chemotherapy radiation therapy and surgical resection It is currently unclear if extent of resection for example intralesional resection versus marginal or wide resection has an impact on survival or local control of disease A systematic literature search for the years 1960 to 2008 was performed looking at publications involving treatment of spinal ES and OS From these 208 articles 16 were selected for analysis and were reviewed in depth Studies were presented to a group of spinal oncology experts Literature was graded for quality summarized and presented to an international expert group with consensus recommendations generated For ES of the spine 10 studies were analyzed For OS of the spine 6 studies were analyzed For both ES and OS of the spine moderate level evidence supported a strong recommendation that neoadjuvant chemotherapy offers significant improvements in local control and long-term survival and is essential in multimodality management For spinal ES very low level evidence supported a weak recommendation that en bloc surgical resection provides improved local control but not improved overall survival Radiation therapy for spinal ES may also be used for local control either alone or to supplement incomplete resection For spinal OS very low evidence supported a strong recommendation that en bloc resection provides improved local control and potentially improved overall survival Patients with ES and OS are currently managed with multiple modalities involving surgery radiation and chemotherapy For both histopathologies advances in chemotherapy have led to the greatest improvements in survival over the last few decades Neoadjuvant therapy portents the most favorable local control and long-term survival En bloc surgical resection may improve overall survival and decrease risk of recurrence,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1556, 206, 1, 3, 789, 2, 1391, 883, 20, 35, 944, 2005, 1222, 87, 6, 206, 2, 4896, 241, 4, 3, 789, 666, 14, 3, 200, 1, 536, 56, 2, 18, 345, 1, 1039, 1, 221, 170, 23, 38, 228, 823, 25, 2, 293, 182, 4, 7, 5, 1499, 3011, 2, 118, 3011, 2, 118, 1, 3, 2342, 32, 694, 2231, 5, 2425, 24, 1267, 56, 121, 36, 2, 221, 170, 192, 16, 694, 1200, 492, 1039, 1, 170, 9, 2685, 7549, 170, 185, 3450, 15, 1019, 170, 71, 35, 345, 23, 25, 15, 293, 182, 1, 34, 8, 1556, 789, 1901, 9, 3, 60, 10391, 6, 1375, 10, 173, 9095, 28, 4463, 1267, 24, 1, 1499, 3011, 2, 118, 29, 46, 5920, 2384, 245, 11, 715, 9, 65, 2, 11, 446, 4, 2436, 94, 11, 917, 6, 8, 87, 1, 1499, 413, 3186, 789, 10, 3468, 9, 372, 3989, 2, 917, 6, 35, 944, 2005, 87, 5, 1391, 883, 1419, 9, 3011, 1, 3, 2342, 79, 94, 11, 311, 9, 118, 1, 3, 2342, 49, 94, 11, 311, 9, 110, 3011, 2, 118, 1, 3, 2342, 1163, 301, 241, 2708, 8, 1082, 3347, 17, 536, 56, 2339, 93, 1474, 4, 293, 182, 2, 319, 337, 25, 2, 16, 1452, 4, 2425, 284, 9, 1499, 3011, 923, 154, 301, 241, 2708, 8, 4241, 3347, 17, 4375, 5590, 221, 170, 777, 231, 293, 182, 84, 44, 231, 63, 25, 121, 36, 9, 1499, 3011, 68, 120, 40, 95, 9, 293, 182, 361, 279, 15, 6, 5836, 2610, 170, 9, 1499, 118, 923, 154, 241, 2708, 8, 1082, 3347, 17, 4375, 5590, 170, 777, 231, 293, 182, 2, 751, 231, 63, 25, 7, 5, 3011, 2, 118, 32, 694, 2231, 5, 232, 1558, 1267, 152, 121, 2, 56, 9, 110, 28954, 954, 4, 56, 47, 836, 6, 3, 2199, 1474, 4, 25, 252, 3, 1060, 1021, 1968, 536, 36, 58333, 3, 96, 913, 293, 182, 2, 319, 337, 25, 4375, 5590, 221, 170, 68, 401, 63, 25, 2, 775, 43, 1, 146]",2253.0,19829278,240

The kinase Mirk is a potential therapeutic target in osteosarcoma.,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,2009-12-30,"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor affecting children and adolescents. The majority of patients are treated by surgery and chemotherapy but have limited alternative therapeutic options. Kinases play an important role in the growth and survival of tumor cells. We aim to identify specific kinases to be vital in the survival of osteosarcoma cells and thus may be a key target in creating novel anticancer therapies. A lentiviral short hairpin RNA kinase library, screened osteosarcoma cells, identified kinase minibrain-related kinase (Mirk) (Dyrk1B) as a potential target. Knockdown Mirk expression could inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis. Chemically synthetic small interfering RNA knockdown and complementary DNA rescue assay further confirmed the results from the decrease of Mirk gene expression.

Lentiviral shRNA screen of human kinases identifies PLK1 as a potential therapeutic target for osteosarcoma.,Cancer letters,Cancer Lett.,2010-02-09,"We describe an optimized systematic screen of known kinases using osteosarcoma cell lines (KHOS and U-2OS) and a lentiviral-based short hairpin RNA (shRNA) human kinase library.

We identified several kinases, including human polo-like kinase (PLK1), which inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells when knocked down. cDNA rescue and synthetic siRNA assays confirm that the observed phenotypic changes result from the loss of PLK1 gene expression. Furthermore, a small molecule inhibitor to PLK1 inhibited osteosarcoma cell growth and induced apoptosis. Western blot analysis confirmed that PLK1 is highly expressed and activated in several osteosarcoma cell lines as well as in resected tumor samples. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that patients with high PLK1 tumor expression levels correlated with significantly shorter survival than patients with lower levels of tumor PLK1 expression.

Anti-GD2 antibody therapy for GD2-expressing tumors.,Current cancer drug targets,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,2010-03-01,"In the development of novel immune therapies for high-risk cancers, one goal is to find tumor targets that are not widely shared by normal cells. One such target is the surface disialoganglioside GD2. This antigen is expressed on the surface of a variety of tumors for which no curative therapies exist for patients with advanced disease. In childhood, the most common GD2-expressing tumor is neuroblastoma. GD2 is also expressed on several other high-risk tumors, including those of neuroectodermal or epithelial origin, virtually all melanomas, and approximately 50% of tumor samples from osteosarcoma and soft-tissue sarcomas. Because of the tumor-selective expression of this molecule, it is an attractive target for tumor-specific therapies such as antibody therapy. Over the last 2 decades, several anti-GD2 antibodies have been developed. To reduce both the toxicity of the antibody and the development of human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA), research efforts have primarily focused on exploring anti-GD2 antibodies that have progressively more human elements while at the same time reducing the mouse components.

Pediatric and adult osteosarcoma: comparisons and contrasts in presentation and therapy.,Cancer treatment and research,Cancer Treat. Res.,2009-01-01,"Most data on osteosarcoma is derived from pediatric studies. Although the majority of adult patients with osteosarcoma are young adults, who might be treated in a similar fashion, experience derived from a slightly older population is helpful in directing therapy. We treated a series of 123 patients with osteosarcoma of the extremities with adriamycin and cisplatin as induction therapy. Adriamycin was infused intravenously at 90 mg/m2 over 96 h. Cisplatin was infused intra-arterially at 120-160 mg/m2 over 2-24 h. Sequential addition of methotrexate and methotrexate plus ifosfamide in subsequent cohorts improved the continuous relapse-free survival of poor responders such that overall survival improvement was noted in the group where therapy was modified by adding both agents to those with <90% tumor necrosis. Patients with chondroblastic osteosarcoma with poor necrosis had a trend towards improved continuous relapse-free survival compared with other patients with conventional osteosarcoma. Histologic variants of osteosarcoma except telangiectatic osteosarcoma had a worse prognosis than those with conventional osteosarcoma. The variants, especially dedifferentiated parosteal osteosarcoma and dedifferentiated well-differentiated intraosseous osteosarcoma are more common in adults than children, accounting for some of the inferior prognosis in adults. Older patients obviously cannot tolerate the doses of therapy given to children and young adults, again decreasing the chances of successful treatment. Patients with secondary osteosarcoma are often much older as are many with osteosarcomas of the pelvis and jaw. These tumors tend to be less responsive.

Oleanane triterpenoid CDDO-Me induces apoptosis in multidrug resistant osteosarcoma cells through inhibition of Stat3 pathway.,BMC cancer,BMC Cancer,2010-05-10,"The activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) pathway correlates with tumor growth, survival, drug resistance and poor prognosis in osteosarcoma. To explore the potential therapeutic values of this pathway, we assessed both the expression and the activation of Stat3 pathway in several pairs of multidrug resistant (MDR) osteosarcoma cell lines, and tissues. To explore the potential therapeutic values of this pathway, we analyzed the ability of the synthetic oleanane triterpenoid, C-28 methyl ester of 2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolen-1,9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO-Me), to inhibit Stat3 expression and activation as well as its effects on doxorubicin sensitivity in osteosarcoma cells. Expression of Stat3, phosphorylated Stat3 (pStat3) and Stat3 targeted proteins, including Bcl-XL, Survivin and MCL-1 were determined in drug sensitive and MDR osteosarcoma cell lines and tissues by Western blot analysis. The effect of CDDO-Me on osteosarcoma cell growth was evaluated by MTT and apoptosis by PARP cleavage assay and caspase-3/7 activity. Stat3 pathway was activated in osteosarcoma tissues and in MDR cell lines. CDDO-Me inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in osteosarcoma cell lines. Treatment with CDDO-Me significantly decreased the level of nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of Stat3. The inhibition of Stat3 pathway correlated with the suppression of the anti-apoptotic Stat3 targeted genes Bcl-XL, survivin, and MCL-1. Furthermore, CDDO-Me increased the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin in the MDR osteosarcoma cell lines. Stat3 pathway is overexpressed in MDR osteosarcoma cells. CDDO-Me significantly inhibited Stat3 phosphorylation, Stat3 nuclear translocation and induced apoptosis in osteosarcoma.

CD117 and Stro-1 identify osteosarcoma tumor-initiating cells associated with metastasis and drug resistance.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2010-05-11,"Emerging evidence indicates the presence of tumor-initiating cells (TIC) or cancer stem cells in osteosarcoma. However, no study has shown specific markers to identify osteosarcoma TICs with in vivo tumor formation ability. Additionally, there has been a lack of investigations gauging the contribution of osteosarcoma TICs to metastatic and drug-resistant properties. In this study, we have identified mouse and human osteosarcoma TICs using mesenchymal stem cell markers CD117 and Stro-1. These markers were preferentially expressed in spheres and doxorubicin-resistant cells. Both mouse and human cells expressing these markers were sorted and analyzed for their abilities of tumor formation with as few as 200 cells, self-renewability, multipotency, drug resistance, metastatic potential, and enrichment of a metastasis-associated marker (CXCR4) and a drug resistance marker (ABCG2). CD117(+)Stro-1(+) cells efficiently formed serially transplantable tumors, whereas CD117(-)Stro-1(-) cells rarely initiated tumors. On orthotopic injections, CD117(+)Stro-1(+ )cell-derived tumors metastasized at a high frequency.

Inhibition of ABCB1 (MDR1) expression by an siRNA nanoparticulate delivery system to overcome drug resistance in osteosarcoma.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2010-05-24,"The use of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in treating osteosarcoma has improved patients' average 5 year survival rate from 20% to 70% in the past 30 years. However, for patients who progress after chemotherapy, its effectiveness diminishes due to the emergence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) after prolonged therapy. In order to overcome both the dose-limiting side effects of conventional chemotherapeutic agents and the therapeutic failure resulting from MDR, we designed and evaluated a novel drug delivery system for MDR1 siRNA delivery. Novel biocompatible, lipid-modified dextran-based polymeric nanoparticles were used as the platform for MDR1 siRNA delivery; and the efficacy of combination therapy with this system was evaluated. In this study, multi-drug resistant osteosarcoma cell lines (KHOS(R2) and U-2OS(R2)) were treated with the MDR1 siRNA nanocarriers and MDR1 protein (P-gp) expression, drug retention, and immunofluoresence were analyzed. Combination therapy of the MDR1 siRNA loaded nanocarriers with increasing concentrations of doxorubicin was also analyzed. We observed that MDR1 siRNA loaded dextran nanoparticles efficiently suppresses P-gp expression in the drug resistant osteosarcoma cell lines. The results also demonstrated that this approach may be capable of reversing drug resistance by increasing the amount of drug accumulation in MDR cell lines. Lipid-modified dextran-based polymeric nanoparticles are a promising platform for siRNA delivery.

Noninvasive imaging with thallium-201 scintigraphy may not correlate with survival in patients with osteosarcoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-09-01,"Histologic response to preoperative chemotherapy is a strong prognostic factor for osteosarcoma (OS). Thallium-201 (Tl-201) scintigraphic response to initial chemotherapy has previously been described as a predictor of histologic response.

A total of 22 patients with biopsy-proven OS of the extremity underwent Tl-201 imaging before and immediately after preoperative chemotherapy. The maximum pixel counts taken over the tumor divided by those taken of a background region yielded a tumor-to-background ratio (TBR). The percentage of change in the TBR before and after adjuvant chemotherapy, defined as the alteration ratio (AR), was correlated with EFS. The median AR was 85% (range, 28-100%). The 3-year EFS was 0.72 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.48-0.86) and the 5-year EFS was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.43-0.86).

Cancer Res.,2010-06-24,"Osteosarcoma most commonly recurs in the lung. Based on preliminary data on the antitumor effects of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in animal models, and promising phase I trials, we embarked on a feasibility study of inhaled GM-CSF in patients with first isolated pulmonary recurrence of osteosarcoma. Forty-three eligible patients received inhaled GM-CSF at doses from 250 to 1,750 microg twice daily on alternate weeks. Following two cycles, patients underwent thoracotomy to resect tumor and analyze pulmonary nodules for expression of Fas/Fas ligand (Fas/FasL), and the presence of dendritic cells by immunostaining for CD1a, clusterin, and S100. Following surgery, patients received 12 additional cycles of therapy on alternating weeks or until progression. Event-free survival and survival, and feasibility of therapy delivery were evaluated. Dose escalation to 1,750 microg twice daily was feasible with no dose-limiting toxicity. Mean scores for Fas/FasL in nodules from patients with bilateral recurrence who underwent unilateral thoracotomy pretreatment (using a scoring system of 0-3) were 1.3 and 0.88, respectively, compared with 0.78 and 0.62 in nodules resected following two cycles of therapy.

Modeling human osteosarcoma in the mouse: From bedside to bench.,Bone,Bone,2010-08-06,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary tumour of bone, occurring predominantly in the second decade of life. High-dose cytotoxic chemotherapy and surgical resection have improved prognosis, with long-term survival for patients with localized (non-metastatic) disease approaching 70%. At presentation approximately 20% of patients have metastases and almost all patients with recurrent OS have metastatic disease and cure rates for patients with metastatic or recurrent disease remain poor (<20% survival). Over the past 20 years, considerable progress has been made in the understanding of OS pathogenesis, yet these insights have not translated into substantial therapeutic advances and clinical outcomes. Further progress is essential in order to develop molecularly based therapies that target both primary lesions as well as metastatic disease. The increasing sophistication with which gene expression can be modulated in the mouse, both positively and negatively in addition to temporally, has allowed for the recent generation of more faithful OS models than have previously been available. These murine OS models can recapitulate all aspects of the disease process, from initiation and establishment to invasion and dissemination to distant sites. The development and utilisation of murine models that faithfully recapitulate human osteosarcoma, complementing existing approaches using human and canine disease, holds significant promise in furthering our understanding of the genetic basis of the disease and, more critically, in advancing pre-clinical studies aimed at the rational development and trialing of new therapeutic approaches.",Journal Article,3455.0,22.0,OS is the most common primary tumour of occurring predominantly in the second decade of life High-dose cytotoxic chemotherapy and surgical resection have improved prognosis with long-term survival for patients with localized non-metastatic disease approaching 70 At presentation approximately 20 of patients have metastases and almost all patients with recurrent OS have metastatic disease and cure rates for patients with metastatic or recurrent disease remain poor 20 survival Over the past 20 years considerable progress has been made in the understanding of OS pathogenesis yet these insights have not translated into substantial therapeutic advances and clinical outcomes Further progress is essential in order to develop molecularly based therapies that target both primary lesions as well as metastatic disease The increasing sophistication with which gene expression can be modulated in the mouse both positively and negatively in addition to temporally has allowed for the recent generation of more faithful OS models than have previously been available These murine OS models can recapitulate all aspects of the disease process from initiation and establishment to invasion and dissemination to distant sites The development and utilisation of murine models that faithfully recapitulate human complementing existing approaches using human and canine disease holds significant promise in furthering our understanding of the genetic basis of the disease and more critically in advancing pre-clinical studies aimed at the rational development and trialing of new therapeutic approaches,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[118, 16, 3, 96, 186, 86, 770, 1, 1821, 2117, 4, 3, 419, 2025, 1, 358, 64, 61, 759, 56, 2, 221, 170, 47, 231, 356, 5, 319, 337, 25, 9, 7, 5, 909, 220, 113, 34, 7773, 431, 28, 1031, 705, 179, 1, 7, 47, 196, 2, 2214, 62, 7, 5, 387, 118, 47, 113, 34, 2, 1722, 151, 9, 7, 5, 113, 15, 387, 34, 918, 334, 179, 25, 252, 3, 1219, 179, 60, 2658, 1466, 71, 85, 1229, 4, 3, 612, 1, 118, 1384, 1145, 46, 1957, 47, 44, 5136, 237, 1281, 189, 954, 2, 38, 123, 195, 1466, 16, 1452, 4, 1732, 6, 690, 2372, 90, 235, 17, 283, 110, 86, 406, 22, 149, 22, 113, 34, 3, 602, 26299, 5, 92, 145, 55, 122, 40, 1757, 4, 3, 830, 110, 2375, 2, 2723, 4, 352, 6, 11114, 71, 2313, 9, 3, 435, 914, 1, 80, 17954, 118, 274, 76, 47, 373, 85, 390, 46, 1471, 118, 274, 122, 7746, 62, 2695, 1, 3, 34, 1129, 29, 1118, 2, 5346, 6, 578, 2, 3430, 6, 626, 633, 3, 193, 2, 23452, 1, 1471, 274, 17, 17760, 7746, 171, 10455, 1692, 611, 75, 171, 2, 9099, 34, 5253, 93, 1783, 4, 30835, 114, 612, 1, 3, 336, 877, 1, 3, 34, 2, 80, 4331, 4, 5155, 671, 38, 94, 1295, 28, 3, 2696, 193, 2, 46165, 1, 217, 189, 611]",1592.0,20696288,189

The DZX group had higher mean cumulative anthracycline dose (510 mg/m(2) [SD 120 mg/m(2)] versus 414 mg/m(2) [SD 99 mg/m(2)], P = .002), however mean lowest left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) values were higher for DZX (52.5% [SD 5.6%] versus 47.2% [SD 10.9%], P = .014). Fifteen of 19 patients with cardiac dysfunction were PIDX patients (P = .15). Five PIDX patients required cardiac medication, and 1 patient died of congestive heart failure (CHF). Sixteen patients with cardiac dysfunction had improvement, demonstrated by EF ≥ 50% at last echocardiogram. Although not statistically significant, there were 4 DZX patients with cardiac dysfunction.

Cyclin G-associated kinase is necessary for osteosarcoma cell proliferation and receptor trafficking.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2010-09-29,"Osteosarcoma is the most frequent primary malignant bone tumor among the children. The advent of neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved the prognosis of patients with osteosarcoma in the 1980s, but it has since plateaued in the past decades. Recently, one of the most researched areas in sarcoma treatment is tyrosine kinases. Here, we describe research on a serine/threonine kinase, cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK), which has not been reported in osteosarcoma previously. In this study, a lentiviral based human shRNA library was utilized to screen for kinases in KHOS and U-2OS osteosarcoma cells. The expression of GAK was examined in osteosarcoma and the effect on cell proliferation was analyzed by GAK siRNA knockdown. The level of GAK expression and its correlation to prognosis was analyzed in osteosarcoma tissue microarray. The effect of GAK depletion on insulin-like growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated signal transduction was analyzed by Western blot. We observed that GAK was overexpressed in both osteosarcoma cell lines and tissue samples when compared with human osteoblasts. GAK knockdown by siRNA decreased cell proliferation in both drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant osteosarcoma cell lines. Immunohistochemistry of osteosarcoma tissue microarray revealed that overexpression of GAK was associated with poor prognosis. Finally, knockdown of GAK resulted in alterations of receptor trafficking and several downstream proteins. In conclusion, our results suggest that osteosarcoma cell proliferation and survival are dependent on GAK. These findings may lead to the development of new therapeutic options for osteosarcoma.",Journal Article,3401.0,18.0,is the most frequent primary malignant tumor among the children The advent of neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved the prognosis of patients with in the 1980s but it has since plateaued in the past decades Recently one of the most researched areas in treatment is tyrosine kinases Here we describe research on a serine/threonine kinase cyclin G-associated kinase GAK which has not been reported in previously In this study a lentiviral based human shRNA library was utilized to screen for kinases in KHOS and U-2OS cells The expression of GAK was examined in and the effect on cell proliferation was analyzed by GAK siRNA knockdown The level of GAK expression and its correlation to prognosis was analyzed in tissue microarray The effect of GAK depletion on insulin-like growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated signal transduction was analyzed by Western blot We observed that GAK was overexpressed in both cell lines and tissue samples when compared with human osteoblasts GAK knockdown by siRNA decreased cell proliferation in both drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant cell lines Immunohistochemistry of tissue microarray revealed that overexpression of GAK was associated with poor prognosis Finally knockdown of GAK resulted in alterations of receptor trafficking and several downstream proteins In conclusion our results suggest that cell proliferation and survival are dependent on GAK These findings may lead to the development of new therapeutic options for,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[16, 3, 96, 908, 86, 393, 30, 107, 3, 541, 3, 4114, 1, 536, 56, 97, 231, 3, 356, 1, 7, 5, 4, 3, 8361, 84, 192, 71, 1192, 13294, 4, 3, 1219, 1968, 761, 104, 1, 3, 96, 31682, 1361, 4, 24, 16, 564, 1549, 467, 21, 897, 389, 23, 8, 3734, 5131, 216, 1226, 499, 41, 216, 21590, 92, 71, 44, 85, 210, 4, 373, 4, 26, 45, 8, 7823, 90, 171, 3976, 4157, 10, 2080, 6, 2413, 9, 1549, 4, 26853, 2, 1767, 23779, 37, 3, 55, 1, 21590, 10, 409, 4, 2, 3, 254, 23, 31, 457, 10, 311, 20, 21590, 1919, 1563, 3, 301, 1, 21590, 55, 2, 211, 816, 6, 356, 10, 311, 4, 246, 1727, 3, 254, 1, 21590, 2286, 23, 1601, 733, 129, 161, 2, 829, 129, 161, 153, 517, 1235, 2761, 10, 311, 20, 1521, 2639, 21, 164, 17, 21590, 10, 1711, 4, 110, 31, 285, 2, 246, 347, 198, 72, 5, 171, 5965, 21590, 1563, 20, 1919, 340, 31, 457, 4, 110, 234, 745, 2, 4814, 436, 31, 285, 888, 1, 246, 1727, 553, 17, 851, 1, 21590, 10, 41, 5, 334, 356, 1368, 1563, 1, 21590, 627, 4, 593, 1, 153, 6105, 2, 392, 1489, 652, 4, 1221, 114, 99, 309, 17, 31, 457, 2, 25, 32, 470, 23, 21590, 46, 272, 68, 1122, 6, 3, 193, 1, 217, 189, 838, 9]",1498.0,20881269,73
Twenty years of follow-up of survivors of childhood osteosarcoma: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-10-04,"Osteosarcoma survivors have received significant chemotherapy and have undergone substantial surgeries. Their very long-term outcomes (20 year) are reported here. The authors assessed the long-term outcomes of 733 5-year survivors of childhood osteosarcoma diagnosed from 1970 to 1986 to provide a comprehensive evaluation of medical and psychosocial outcomes for survivors enrolled in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS). Outcomes evaluated included overall survival, second malignant neoplasms (SMNs), recurrent osteosarcoma, chronic health conditions, health status (general and mental health and functional limitations), and psychosocial factors. Outcomes of osteosarcoma survivors were compared with general-population statistics, other CCSS survivors, and CCSS siblings. Survivors had a mean follow-up of 21.6 years. The overall survival of children diagnosed with osteosarcoma who survived 5 years at 20 years from original diagnosis was 88.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 86.6%-90.5%). The cumulative incidence of SMNs at 25 years was 5.4%, with a standardized incidence ratio of 4.79 (95% CI, 3.54-6.33; P<.01). Overall, 86.9% of osteosarcoma survivors experienced at least 1 chronic medical condition, and >50% experienced ≥2 conditions. Compared with survivors of other cancers, osteosarcoma survivors did not differ in their reported general health status (odds ratio [OR], 0.9; 95% CI, 0.7-1.2), but were more likely to report an adverse health status in at least 1 domain (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.6-2.2), with activity limitations (29.1%) being the most common.

Expression profiling of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary breast tumors using cancer-specific and whole genome gene panels on the DASL® platform.,BMC medical genomics,BMC Med Genomics,2010-12-20,"The cDNA-mediated Annealing, extension, Selection and Ligation (DASL) assay has become a suitable gene expression profiling system for degraded RNA from paraffin-embedded tissue. We examined assay characteristics and the performance of the DASL 502-gene Cancer Panel v1 (1.5K) and 24,526-gene panel (24K) platforms at differentiating nine human epidermal growth factor receptor 2- positive (HER2+) and 11 HER2-negative (HER2-) paraffin-embedded breast tumors. Bland-Altman plots and Spearman correlations evaluated intra/inter-panel agreement of normalized expression values. Unequal-variance t-statistics tested for differences in expression levels between HER2 + and HER2 - tumors. Regulatory network analysis was performed using Metacore (GeneGo Inc., St. Joseph, MI). Technical replicate correlations ranged between 0.815-0.956 and 0.986-0.997 for the 1.5K and 24K panels, respectively. Inter-panel correlations of expression values for the common 498 genes across the two panels ranged between 0.485-0.573. Inter-panel correlations of expression values of 17 probes with base-pair sequence matches between the 1.5K and 24K panels ranged between 0.652-0.899. In both panels, erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB2) was the most differentially expressed gene between the HER2 + and HER2 - tumors and seven additional genes had p-values < 0.05 and log2 -fold changes > |0.5| in expression between HER2 + and HER2 - tumors: topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A), cyclin a2 (CCNA2), v-fos fbj murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (FOS), wingless-type mmtv integration site family, member 5a (WNT5A), growth factor receptor-bound protein 7 (GRB7), cell division cycle 2 (CDC2), and baculoviral iap repeat-containing protein 5 (BIRC5). The top 52 discriminating probes from the 24K panel are enriched with genes belonging to the regulatory networks centered around v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC), tumor protein p53 (TP53), and estrogen receptor α (ESR1). Network analysis with a two-step extension also showed that the eight discriminating genes common to the 1.5K and 24K panels are functionally linked together through MYC, TP53, and ESR1.

Association of the highly prevalent TP53 R337H mutation with pediatric choroid plexus carcinoma and osteosarcoma in southeast Brazil.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-12-29,"The inherited, low-penetrance arginine-to-histidine substitution at codon 337 (R337H) of the tumor protein 53 gene (TP53) is clustered in southeast Brazil (estimated frequency, 0.3%). Although its tumorigenic effect initially appeared to be tissue-specific, recent evidence suggests its association with a broader range of tumors. Therefore, the authors of this report investigated the spectrum of pediatric malignancies associated with the TP53 R337H mutation at a single referral institution in southeast Brazil. Genomic DNA samples from 493 children with malignancies were screened for the R337H mutation. Available tumor samples from carriers were investigated for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and nuclear p53 accumulation. Clinical data were obtained from medical records. Sixty-five of 70 patients (93%) with adrenocortical tumors (ACTs), 9 of 13 patients (69%) with choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC), and 3 of 41 patients (7.3%) with osteosarcoma carried the mutation. The proportion of CPC to choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) was much higher than that reported elsewhere. Osteosarcoma in carriers had a significantly poorer outcome (P = .02). The mutation was not identified in patients who had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 187), recurrent ALL (n = 49), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 44), lymphoma (n = 30), non-CPC central nervous system tumors (n = 26), Ewing sarcoma (n = 25), or rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 8). Among the tumors that were available for analysis, LOH with retention of the mutant allele was confirmed in 21 of 21 ACTs, in 2 of 2 CPCs, and in 2 of 3 osteosarcomas that were positive for R337H. CPCs and osteosarcomas that were positive for R337H had marked nuclear accumulation of p53. The current findings demonstrated compellingly that the TP53 R337H mutation is associated not only with ACT but also with CPC and, to a lesser extent, with osteosarcoma, both of which are core-component tumors of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome.",Journal Article,3310.0,45.0,The inherited low-penetrance arginine-to-histidine substitution at codon 337 R337H of the tumor protein 53 gene TP53 is clustered in southeast Brazil estimated frequency 0.3 Although its tumorigenic effect initially appeared to be tissue-specific recent evidence suggests its association with a broader range of tumors Therefore the authors of this report investigated the spectrum of pediatric malignancies associated with the TP53 R337H mutation at a single referral institution in southeast Brazil Genomic DNA samples from 493 children with malignancies were screened for the R337H mutation Available tumor samples from carriers were investigated for loss of heterozygosity LOH and nuclear p53 accumulation Clinical data were obtained from medical records Sixty-five of 70 patients 93 with tumors ACTs 9 of 13 patients 69 with choroid plexus carcinoma CPC and 3 of 41 patients 7.3 with carried the mutation The proportion of CPC to choroid plexus papilloma CPP was much higher than that reported elsewhere in carriers had a significantly poorer outcome P .02 The mutation was not identified in patients who had acute lymphoblastic ALL n 187 recurrent ALL n 49 acute myeloid n 44 n 30 non-CPC central nervous system tumors n 26 n 25 or n 8 Among the tumors that were available for analysis LOH with retention of the mutant allele was confirmed in 21 of 21 ACTs in 2 of 2 CPCs and in 2 of 3 osteosarcomas that were positive for R337H CPCs and osteosarcomas that were positive for R337H had marked nuclear accumulation of p53 The current findings demonstrated compellingly that the TP53 R337H mutation is associated not only with ACT but also with CPC and to a lesser extent with both of which are core-component tumors of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 2986, 154, 4792, 5392, 6, 15954, 5029, 28, 3673, 8275, 29109, 1, 3, 30, 178, 699, 145, 1206, 16, 6464, 4, 21377, 10452, 661, 675, 13, 27, 242, 211, 3795, 254, 1625, 2121, 6, 40, 246, 112, 435, 241, 844, 211, 248, 5, 8, 5410, 184, 1, 57, 673, 3, 738, 1, 26, 414, 565, 3, 1873, 1, 815, 441, 41, 5, 3, 1206, 29109, 258, 28, 8, 226, 2096, 731, 4, 21377, 10452, 572, 261, 347, 29, 11304, 541, 5, 441, 11, 2261, 9, 3, 29109, 258, 390, 30, 347, 29, 1316, 11, 565, 9, 407, 1, 3963, 2594, 2, 928, 624, 1835, 38, 74, 11, 683, 29, 484, 1064, 1746, 365, 1, 431, 7, 966, 5, 57, 4459, 83, 1, 233, 7, 790, 5, 12169, 9576, 134, 9305, 2, 27, 1, 605, 7, 67, 27, 5, 2629, 3, 258, 3, 920, 1, 9305, 6, 12169, 9576, 7017, 17117, 10, 1802, 142, 76, 17, 210, 7116, 4, 1316, 42, 8, 97, 1769, 228, 19, 588, 3, 258, 10, 44, 108, 4, 7, 54, 42, 286, 1275, 62, 78, 5568, 387, 62, 78, 739, 286, 533, 78, 584, 78, 201, 220, 9305, 854, 1880, 398, 57, 78, 432, 78, 243, 15, 78, 66, 107, 3, 57, 17, 11, 390, 9, 65, 2594, 5, 3947, 1, 3, 620, 1254, 10, 557, 4, 239, 1, 239, 4459, 4, 18, 1, 18, 12903, 2, 4, 18, 1, 27, 11089, 17, 11, 109, 9, 29109, 12903, 2, 11089, 17, 11, 109, 9, 29109, 42, 2003, 928, 1835, 1, 624, 3, 291, 272, 264, 46385, 17, 3, 1206, 29109, 258, 16, 41, 44, 158, 5, 2559, 84, 120, 5, 9305, 2, 6, 8, 5191, 1039, 5, 110, 1, 92, 32, 1793, 1249, 57, 1, 3, 5066, 9130, 681]",1747.0,21192060,186

ROCK1 as a potential therapeutic target in osteosarcoma.,Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,J. Orthop. Res.,2011-03-08,"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignancy of bone. Patients with localized disease are routinely treated with surgery and chemotherapy. Unfortunately, many of these patients eventually relapse even after high-dose pre- and postoperative chemotherapy. Upon recurrence of the tumor locally or distantly, they have limited treatment options that are usually unsuccessful. Our prior studies screening lentiviral shRNA libraries, searching for kinases involved in osteosarcoma cell growth and proliferation have identified the Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) as a possible hit. We show in this study that ROCK1 is highly expressed in various tumor cell lines and tumor tissues from osteosarcoma patients. ROCK1 knockdown by synthetic siRNA decreases cell proliferation, viability and induces apoptosis in osteosarcoma cell lines KHOS and U-2OS. Finally, we established the relationship between expression levels of ROCK1 and clinical prognosis in osteosarcoma patients by using immunohistochemistry. There were significant differences in overall survival between cohorts of patients with ROCK1 levels categorized as high-staining, moderate-staining, and low-staining.

Inhibition of polo-like kinase 1 leads to the suppression of osteosarcoma cell growth in vitro and in vivo.,Anti-cancer drugs,Anticancer Drugs,2011-06-01,"Osteosarcoma is the most common type of primary bone cancer in children and adolescents. Treatment options for osteosarcoma may include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Unfortunately, many patients eventually relapse, resulting in an unsatisfactory outcome. The serine/threonine-specific polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a kinase that plays an important role in mitosis and the maintenance of genomic stability. PLK1 has been found to be highly expressed in the malignant cells of osteosarcoma. Here, we describe the in-vitro and in-vivo effects of BI 2536, a small-molecule inhibitor of PLK1, which through inhibiting PLK1 enzymatic activity, causes mitotic arrest and eventually induces cancer cell apoptosis. In this study, we show that the PLK1 inhibitor, BI 2536, inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in two-dimensional and three-dimensional cultures of osteosarcoma cell lines, KHOS and U-2OS. A proliferation assay performed both in two-dimensional and three-dimensional culture showed that the growth of both cell lines was inhibited by BI 2536. Cell cycle analysis showed that the cells treated with BI 2536 were mainly arrested in the G2/M phase. Immunofluorescence and western blotting analysis confirmed that the administration of BI 2536 led to significant decrease of PLK1 and Mcl-1 protein expression levels in dose-dependent and time-dependent manners. Furthermore, BI 2536-induced apoptosis in the osteosarcoma cell lines was shown by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and caspase assay. Finally, in mouse osteosarcoma xenografts, BI 2536-treated mice had significantly smaller tumors compared with the control mice.

Proton-based radiotherapy for unresectable or incompletely resected osteosarcoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2011-03-29,"A study was undertaken to assess clinical outcome and the role of proton therapy for local control of osteosarcoma (OSA). All patients who received proton therapy or mixed photon-proton radiotherapy from 1983 to 2009 at the Massachusetts General Hospital were reviewed. Criteria for proton therapy were the need for high dose in the context of highly conformal radiotherapy of unresected or partially resected OSA, positive postoperative margins, postoperative imaging studies with macroscopic disease, or incomplete resection as defined by the surgeon. The primary endpoint was local control of the site treated; secondary endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), long-term toxicity, and prognostic factors associated with clinical outcome. Fifty-five patients with a median age of 29 years (range, 2-76 years) were offered proton therapy. The mean dose was 68.4 gray (Gy; standard deviation, 5.4 Gy). Of the total dose, 58.2% (range, 11%-100%) was delivered with protons. Local control after 3 and 5 years was 82% and 72%, respectively. The distant failure rate was 26% after 3 and 5 years. The 5-year DFS was 65%, and the 5-year OS was 67%. The extent of surgical resection did not correlate with outcome. Risk factors for local failure were ≥ 2 grade disease (P < .0001) and total treatment length (P = .008). Grade 3 to 4 late toxicity was seen in 30.1 % of patients.

Addition of pamidronate to chemotherapy for the treatment of osteosarcoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-11-08,"This study evaluated the safety and feasibility of the addition of pamidronate to chemotherapy for treatment of osteosarcoma. The authors treated 40 patients with osteosarcoma with cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate with the addition of pamidronate 2 mg/kg/dose (max dose 90 mg) monthly for 12 doses. Survival, event-free survival (EFS), and durability of orthopedic reconstruction were evaluated. For patients with localized disease, event-free survival (EFS) at 5 years was 72% and overall survival 93%. For patients with metastatic disease, EFS at 5 years was 45% and overall survival 64%. Toxicity was similar to patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Thirteen of 14 uncemented implants demonstrated successful osteointegration.

"Genetic amplification of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway genes, including VEGFA, in human osteosarcoma.",Cancer,Cancer,2011-04-14,"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary tumor of bone. It is a highly vascular and extremely destructive malignancy that mainly affects children and young adults. The authors conducted microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and pathway analyses to gain a systemic view of pathway alterations in the genetically altered genes. Recurrent amplified and deleted genes that were detected by aCGH were subjected to an analysis based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes to identify the altered pathways. Among the enriched pathways, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway genes collectively were amplified, and alterations of this pathway were validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry analyses in 58 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded osteosarcoma archival tissues that had clinical follow-up information. The pathway enrichment analyses of the aCGH data revealed that VEGF pathway genes, including the VEGFA gene itself, were amplified significantly in osteosarcoma. Genetic amplification of the VEGFA gene, both focally and in larger fragment, was validated by FISH analysis. It is noteworthy that amplification of the VEGFA gene and elevated expression of the VEGFA protein were associated significantly with microvascular density and adverse tumor-free survival in patients with osteosarcoma. The authors report for the first time that VEGF pathway genes, including the VEGFA gene, are amplified in osteosarcoma. Amplification of the VEGFA gene is not only an important mechanism for elevated VEGFA protein expression but also is a poor prognostic factor for tumor-free survival. Combined classification of VEGFA gene amplification and positive VEGFA protein expression may provide a more accurate stratification method of selecting anti-VEGF therapy for patients with osteosarcoma.",Journal Article,3204.0,67.0,is the most common primary tumor of It is a highly vascular and extremely destructive malignancy that mainly affects children and young adults The authors conducted microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH and pathway analyses to gain a systemic view of pathway alterations in the genetically altered genes Recurrent amplified and deleted genes that were detected by aCGH were subjected to an analysis based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes to identify the altered pathways Among the enriched pathways vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF pathway genes collectively were amplified and alterations of this pathway were validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH and immunohistochemistry analyses in 58 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archival tissues that had clinical follow-up information The pathway enrichment analyses of the aCGH data revealed that VEGF pathway genes including the VEGFA gene itself were amplified significantly in Genetic amplification of the VEGFA gene both focally and in larger fragment was validated by FISH analysis It is noteworthy that amplification of the VEGFA gene and elevated expression of the VEGFA protein were associated significantly with microvascular density and adverse tumor-free survival in patients with The authors report for the first time that VEGF pathway genes including the VEGFA gene are amplified in Amplification of the VEGFA gene is not only an important mechanism for elevated VEGFA protein expression but also is a poor prognostic factor for tumor-free survival Combined classification of VEGFA gene amplification and positive VEGFA protein expression may provide a more accurate stratification method of selecting anti-VEGF therapy for patients with,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[16, 3, 96, 186, 86, 30, 1, 192, 16, 8, 561, 756, 2, 2938, 11122, 710, 17, 2615, 2561, 541, 2, 1169, 857, 3, 738, 426, 1727, 90, 2352, 572, 1554, 8879, 2, 308, 318, 6, 1803, 8, 403, 3811, 1, 308, 593, 4, 3, 2301, 1495, 214, 387, 2429, 2, 4389, 214, 17, 11, 530, 20, 8879, 11, 4325, 6, 35, 65, 90, 23, 3, 20732, 15765, 1, 214, 2, 5085, 6, 255, 3, 1495, 460, 107, 3, 2220, 460, 756, 845, 129, 161, 618, 308, 214, 2535, 11, 2429, 2, 593, 1, 26, 308, 11, 938, 20, 1591, 4, 957, 1554, 1277, 2, 888, 318, 4, 717, 3265, 1959, 2487, 2505, 3967, 742, 17, 42, 38, 166, 126, 487, 3, 308, 3020, 318, 1, 3, 8879, 74, 553, 17, 618, 308, 214, 141, 3, 7456, 145, 4045, 11, 2429, 97, 4, 336, 1073, 1, 3, 7456, 145, 110, 9772, 2, 4, 1077, 5245, 10, 938, 20, 1277, 65, 192, 16, 9559, 17, 1073, 1, 3, 7456, 145, 2, 804, 55, 1, 3, 7456, 178, 11, 41, 97, 5, 6466, 1263, 2, 290, 30, 115, 25, 4, 7, 5, 3, 738, 414, 9, 3, 157, 98, 17, 618, 308, 214, 141, 3, 7456, 145, 32, 2429, 4, 1073, 1, 3, 7456, 145, 16, 44, 158, 35, 305, 670, 9, 804, 7456, 178, 55, 84, 120, 16, 8, 334, 177, 161, 9, 30, 115, 25, 397, 947, 1, 7456, 145, 1073, 2, 109, 7456, 178, 55, 68, 377, 8, 80, 1481, 1541, 596, 1, 3675, 312, 618, 36, 9, 7, 5]",1749.0,21495021,18
Do characteristics of pulmonary nodules on computed tomography in children with known osteosarcoma help distinguish whether the nodules are malignant or benign?,Journal of pediatric surgery,J. Pediatr.

The institutional review board approved this HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant, retrospective study of 30 pediatric osteosarcoma patients (median age 14 years, range 8-22) who underwent chest CT with resection of 117 pulmonary nodules from January 2001 to December 2006. Two pediatric radiologists and one chest radiologist independently and retrospectively reviewed the CT scans and classified nodules as benign, malignant, or indeterminate on the basis of nodule size, laterality, number, location, growth, density, margin appearance, and calcification. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine which characteristics were independent predictors of nodule malignancy. Of the 117 nodules, 80 (68%) were malignant and 37 (32%) were benign by pathologic review. The readers correctly classified 93% to 94% of the malignant nodules. For benign lesions, the results were not as accurate, with the readers correctly classifying only 11% to 30% of lesions. Most of the benign lesions were classified as indeterminate by the readers (54%-65%). Nodule size (≥5 mm) and the presence of calcifications were associated with an increased probability of malignancy (P b .05). On chest CT, nodule size 5 mm or greater and the presence of calcifications are associated with an increased probability of malignant nodule histology in pediatric patients with osteosarcoma.

Phase 1 clinical trials for sarcomas: the cutting edge.,Current opinion in oncology,Curr Opin Oncol,2011-07-01,"Few standard second-line treatment options exist for advanced sarcoma patients. Some of these patients are offered early-phase clinical trials involving targeted or nontargeted agents. This review outlines recent phase 1 trials involving sarcoma patients, explores current challenges and highlights future opportunities in sarcoma developmental therapeutics. New molecularly targeted phase 1 studies have demonstrated efficacy in sarcomas. For instance, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) antibodies have produced single agent activity in Ewing's sarcoma. Other promising novel agents include an agonist for the apoptosis ligand 2/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (Apo2L/TRAIL) for chondrosarcoma, small molecule inhibitor crizotinib for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, cedarinib for alveolar soft part sarcoma, and rexin-G, a tumor targeted retrovector for osteosarcoma. In addition, different combinations of chemotherapy in combination with newer agents such as trabectedin exhibited efficacy in advanced soft tissue sarcoma. Patients with refractory sarcoma demonstrate benefit from treatment with targeted drugs even in the setting of phase 1 trials.

Frontline treatment of localized osteosarcoma without methotrexate: results of the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital OS99 trial.,Cancer,Cancer,2011-01-10,"The standard treatment of osteosarcoma includes cisplatin and high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX); both agents exert significant toxicity, and HDMTX requires complex pharmacokinetic monitoring and leucovorin rescue. In the previous OS91 trial, the treatment of localized disease with carboplatin, ifosfamide, doxorubicin, and HDMTX yielded outcomes comparable to those of cisplatin-based regimens and caused less toxicity. To build on this experience, the authors conducted a multi-institutional trial (OS99) that evaluated the efficacy of carboplatin, ifosfamide, and doxorubicin without HDMTX in patients with newly diagnosed, localized, resectable osteosarcoma. Treatment was comprised of 12 cycles of chemotherapy administered over 35 weeks: 3 cycles of carboplatin (dose targeted to area under the concentration-time curve of 8 mg/mL × min on Day 1) and ifosfamide (at a dose of 2.65 g/m(2) daily ×3 days) and 1 cycle of doxorubicin (at a dose of 25 mg/m(2) daily ×3 days) before surgical resection, followed by 2 additional cycles of the combination of carboplatin and ifosfamide and 3 cycles each of doxorubicin (25 mg/m(2) daily ×2 days) combined with ifosfamide or carboplatin. A total of 72 eligible patients (median age, 13.4 years) were enrolled between May 1999 and May 2006. Forty of the 66 (60.6%) evaluable patients had good histologic responses (>90% tumor necrosis) to preoperative chemotherapy. The estimated 5-year event-free survival rate was 66.7% ± 7.0% for the OS99 trial compared with 66.0% ± 6.8% for the OS91 trial (P = .98).

MicroRNA-199a-3p is downregulated in human osteosarcoma and regulates cell proliferation and migration.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2011-06-10,"microRNAs (miRNA, miR) play an important role in cancer cell growth and migration; however, the potential roles of miRNAs in osteosarcoma remain largely uncharacterized. By applying a miRNA microarray platform and unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis, we found that several miRNAs have altered expression levels in osteosarcoma cell lines and tumor tissues when compared with normal human osteoblasts. Three miRNAs, miR-199a-3p, miR-127-3p, and miR-376c, were significantly decreased in osteosarcoma cell lines, whereas miR-151-3p and miR-191 were increased in osteosarcoma cell lines in comparison with osteoblasts. Transfection of precursor miR-199a-3p into osteosarcoma cell lines significantly decreased cell growth and migration, thus indicating that the inhibition effect is associated with an increase in the G(1)-phase and a decrease of the S-phase cell population. In addition, we observed decreased mTOR and Stat3 expression in miR-199a-3p transfected cells. This study provides new insights for miRNAs in osteosarcoma and suggests that miR-199a-3p may play a functional role in osteosarcoma cell growth and proliferation.

Effect of size and processing method on the cytotoxicity of realgar nanoparticles in cancer cell lines.,International journal of nanomedicine,Int J Nanomedicine,2011-08-02,"In this study, the effects of the size and Chinese traditional processing (including elutriation, water cleaning, acid cleaning, alkali cleaning) on realgar nanoparticles (RN)-induced antitumor activity in human osteosarcoma cell lines (MG-63) and hepatoma carcinoma cell lines (HepG-2) were investigated. The human normal liver cell line (L-02) was used as control. RN was prepared by high-energy ball milling technology. The results showed that with the assistance of sodium dodecyl sulfate, the size of realgar could be reduced to 127 nm after 12 hours' ball milling. The surface charge was decreased from 0.83 eV to -17.85 eV and the content of As₂O₃ clearly increased. Except for elutriation, the processing methods did not clearly change the size of the RN, but the content of As₂O₃ was reduced dramatically. In vitro MTT tests indicated that in the two cancer cell lines, RN cytotoxicity was more intense than that of the coarse realgar nanoparticles, and cytotoxicity was typically time- and concentration-dependent. Also, RN cytotoxicities in the HepG-2 and L-02 cells all increased with increasing milling time. Due to the reduction of the As₂O₃ content, water cleaning, acid cleaning, and alkali cleaning decreased RN cytotoxicity in HepG-2, but RN after elutriation, with the lowest As₂O₃ (3.5 mg/g) and the smallest size (109.3 nm), showed comparable cytotoxicity in HepG-2 to RN without treatment. Meanwhile, RN-induced cytotoxicity in L-02 cells was clearly reduced. Therefore, it can be concluded that RN may provide a strong antiproliferation effect in the MG-63 and HepG-2 cells. Elutriation processing is a suitable approach to limit the dangerous side-effects of As₂O₃, while maintaining the effectiveness of RN.",Journal Article,3094.0,23.0,In this study the effects of the size and Chinese traditional processing including elutriation water cleaning acid cleaning alkali cleaning on realgar nanoparticles RN -induced antitumor activity in human cell lines MG-63 and hepatoma carcinoma cell lines HepG-2 were investigated The human normal cell line L-02 was used as control RN was prepared by high-energy ball milling technology The results showed that with the assistance of sodium dodecyl sulfate the size of realgar could be reduced to 127 nm after 12 hours ball milling The surface charge was decreased from 0.83 eV to -17.85 eV and the content of As₂O₃ clearly increased Except for elutriation the processing methods did not clearly change the size of the RN but the content of As₂O₃ was reduced dramatically In vitro MTT tests indicated that in the two cancer cell lines RN cytotoxicity was more intense than that of the coarse realgar nanoparticles and cytotoxicity was typically time- and concentration-dependent Also RN cytotoxicities in the HepG-2 and L-02 cells all increased with increasing milling time Due to the reduction of the As₂O₃ content water cleaning acid cleaning and alkali cleaning decreased RN cytotoxicity in HepG-2 but RN after elutriation with the lowest As₂O₃ 3.5 mg/g and the smallest size 109.3 nm showed comparable cytotoxicity in HepG-2 to RN without treatment Meanwhile RN-induced cytotoxicity in L-02 cells was clearly reduced Therefore it can be concluded that RN may provide a strong antiproliferation effect in the MG-63 and HepG-2 cells Elutriation processing is a suitable approach to limit the dangerous side-effects of As₂O₃ while maintaining the effectiveness of RN,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4, 26, 45, 3, 176, 1, 3, 444, 2, 3656, 1847, 3325, 141, 28055, 4388, 25381, 971, 25381, 46732, 25381, 23, 35179, 2889, 4567, 277, 579, 128, 4, 171, 31, 285, 81, 676, 2, 13822, 134, 31, 285, 22606, 18, 11, 565, 3, 171, 295, 31, 328, 805, 588, 10, 95, 22, 182, 4567, 10, 4421, 20, 64, 2803, 22436, 39738, 2033, 3, 99, 224, 17, 5, 3, 6050, 1, 4682, 30384, 6424, 3, 444, 1, 35179, 359, 40, 405, 6, 4080, 2878, 50, 133, 1459, 22436, 39738, 3, 1255, 11812, 10, 340, 29, 13, 852, 10123, 6, 269, 772, 10123, 2, 3, 2457, 1, 31857, 2536, 101, 2187, 9, 28055, 3, 3325, 636, 205, 44, 2536, 707, 3, 444, 1, 3, 4567, 84, 3, 2457, 1, 31857, 10, 405, 2729, 4, 439, 4988, 895, 1103, 17, 4, 3, 100, 12, 31, 285, 4567, 1408, 10, 80, 3933, 76, 17, 1, 3, 26236, 35179, 2889, 2, 1408, 10, 1969, 98, 2, 1227, 470, 120, 4567, 33273, 4, 3, 22606, 18, 2, 805, 588, 37, 62, 101, 5, 602, 39738, 98, 520, 6, 3, 628, 1, 3, 31857, 2457, 4388, 25381, 971, 25381, 2, 46732, 25381, 340, 4567, 1408, 4, 22606, 18, 84, 4567, 50, 28055, 5, 3, 2101, 31857, 27, 33, 81, 499, 2, 3, 11249, 444, 3486, 27, 2878, 224, 1279, 1408, 4, 22606, 18, 6, 4567, 187, 24, 8197, 4567, 277, 1408, 4, 805, 588, 37, 10, 2536, 405, 673, 192, 122, 40, 4724, 17, 4567, 68, 377, 8, 1082, 25066, 254, 4, 3, 81, 676, 2, 22606, 18, 37, 28055, 3325, 16, 8, 2884, 353, 6, 2385, 3, 22026, 1152, 176, 1, 31857, 369, 3284, 3, 1236, 1, 4567]",1668.0,21845047,13
High-throughput genotyping in osteosarcoma identifies multiple mutations in phosphoinositide-3-kinase and other oncogenes.,Cancer,Cancer,2011-10-17,"The identification of new genes that are mutated in osteosarcomas is critical to developing a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this disease and discovering new targets for therapeutic development. The authors identified somatic nonsynonymous coding mutations in oncogenes associated with human cancers and hotspot mutations from tumor suppressor genes that were either well described in the literature or observed multiple times in human cancer sequencing efforts. Then, 961 mutations in 89 genes were systematically characterized across 98 osteosarcoma tumor samples and cell lines. All identified mutations were replicated on an independent platform using homogeneous mass extend matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In total, 14 mutations were identified in at least 1 osteosarcoma tumor sample or cell line. Some of the genetic changes identified were in tumor suppressor genes previously identified as altered in osteosarcoma: p53 (arginine→histidine at codon 273 [R273H], R→cysteine at codon 723 [R273C], and tyrosine→C at codon 163 [Y163C]) and retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) (glutamic acid→* at codon 137 [E137*]). Notably, multiple mutations were identified in phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), catalytic, alpha polypeptide (PIK3CA) (H1047R, E→lysine at codon 545 [E545K], and H→proline at codon 701 [H701P]) that were not observed previously in osteosarcoma.

Preliminary efficacy of the anti-insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor antibody figitumumab in patients with refractory Ewing sarcoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2011-10-24,"Patients with Ewing sarcoma (ES) with metastases and those who relapse fare poorly and receive therapies that carry significant toxicity. This phase 1/2 study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of figitumumab in advanced ES. Patients with sarcoma 10 to 18 years old were enrolled in two dose escalation cohorts (20 and 30 mg/Kg intravenously every 4 weeks) in the phase 1 portion of the study. Patients with ES 10 years old or older were enrolled in the phase 2 portion of the study. The primary phase 2 objective was objective response rate (ORR). Thirty-one patients with ES (n = 16), osteosarcoma (n = 11), or other sarcomas (n = 4) were enrolled in the phase 1 portion of the study. Dose escalation proceeded to 30 mg/kg every 4 weeks with no dose-limiting toxicity identified. In the phase 2 portion of the study, 107 patients with ES received figitumumab at 30 mg/kg every 4 weeks for a median of 2 cycles (range, 1 to 16). Sixty three percent of phase 2 patients had received at least three prior treatment regimens. Of 106 evaluable patients, 15 had a partial response (ORR, 14.2%) and 25 had stable disease. Median overall survival was 8.9 months. Importantly, patients with a pretreatment circulating free insulin-like growth factor (IGF) -1 lower than 0.65 ng/mL (n = 14) had a median OS of 3.6 months, whereas those with a baseline free IGF-1 ≥ 0.65 ng/mL (n = 84) had a median OS of 10.4 months (P < .001).

Phase II study of the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor ridaforolimus in patients with advanced bone and soft tissue sarcomas.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2011-11-07,"Ridaforolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin, an integral component of the phosphatidyl 3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway, with early evidence of activity in sarcomas. This multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase II trial was conducted to assess the antitumor activity of ridaforolimus in patients with distinct subtypes of advanced sarcomas. Patients with metastatic or unresectable soft tissue or bone sarcomas received ridaforolimus 12.5 mg administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion once daily for 5 days every 2 weeks. The primary end point was clinical benefit response (CBR) rate (complete response or partial response [PR] or stable disease ≥ 16 weeks). Safety, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), time to progression, and duration of response were also evaluated. A total of 212 patients were treated in four separate histologic cohorts. In this heavily pretreated population, 61 patients (28.8%) achieved CBR. Median PFS was 15.3 weeks; median OS was 40 weeks. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) confirmed response rate was 1.9%, with four patients achieving confirmed PR (two with osteosarcoma, one with spindle cell sarcoma, and one with malignant fibrous histiocytoma). Archival tumor protein markers analyzed were not correlated with CBR. Related adverse events were generally mild or moderate and consisted primarily of stomatitis, mucosal inflammation, mouth ulceration, rash, and fatigue. Single-agent ridaforolimus in patients with advanced and pretreated sarcomas led to PFS results that compare favorably with historical metrics. A phase III trial based on these data will further define ridaforolimus activity in sarcomas.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",2997.0,,Ridaforolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin an integral component of the phosphatidyl 3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway with early evidence of activity in sarcomas This multicenter open-label single-arm phase II trial was conducted to assess the antitumor activity of ridaforolimus in patients with distinct subtypes of advanced sarcomas Patients with metastatic or unresectable soft tissue or sarcomas received ridaforolimus 12.5 mg administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion once daily for 5 days every 2 weeks The primary end point was clinical benefit response CBR rate complete response or partial response PR or stable disease ≥ 16 weeks Safety progression-free survival PFS overall survival OS time to progression and duration of response were also evaluated A total of 212 patients were treated in four separate histologic cohorts In this heavily pretreated population 61 patients 28.8 achieved CBR Median PFS was 15.3 weeks median OS was 40 weeks Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors RECIST confirmed response rate was 1.9 with four patients achieving confirmed PR two with one with spindle cell and one with malignant fibrous histiocytoma Archival tumor protein markers analyzed were not correlated with CBR Related adverse events were generally mild or moderate and consisted primarily of stomatitis mucosal inflammation mouth ulceration rash and fatigue Single-agent ridaforolimus in patients with advanced and pretreated sarcomas led to PFS results that compare favorably with historical metrics A phase III trial based on these data will further define ridaforolimus activity in sarcomas,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[9069, 16, 35, 230, 1, 2359, 283, 1, 1620, 35, 4450, 1249, 1, 3, 15628, 27, 216, 649, 314, 308, 5, 191, 241, 1, 128, 4, 1479, 26, 1570, 1020, 1756, 226, 475, 124, 215, 160, 10, 426, 6, 423, 3, 579, 128, 1, 9069, 4, 7, 5, 834, 814, 1, 131, 1479, 7, 5, 113, 15, 1468, 1214, 246, 15, 1479, 103, 9069, 133, 33, 81, 468, 22, 8, 201, 3949, 1262, 904, 1059, 391, 9, 33, 162, 454, 18, 244, 3, 86, 396, 741, 10, 38, 247, 51, 6222, 116, 236, 51, 15, 450, 51, 998, 15, 585, 34, 749, 245, 244, 367, 91, 115, 25, 300, 63, 25, 118, 98, 6, 91, 2, 654, 1, 51, 11, 120, 194, 8, 181, 1, 6586, 7, 11, 73, 4, 294, 2282, 884, 736, 4, 26, 2447, 2193, 266, 713, 7, 339, 66, 513, 6222, 52, 300, 10, 167, 27, 244, 52, 118, 10, 327, 244, 51, 451, 371, 4, 537, 57, 1834, 557, 51, 116, 10, 14, 83, 5, 294, 7, 1785, 557, 998, 100, 5, 104, 5, 4052, 31, 2, 104, 5, 393, 5870, 9960, 3967, 30, 178, 525, 311, 11, 44, 438, 5, 6222, 139, 290, 281, 11, 1228, 1980, 15, 1163, 2, 1695, 1561, 1, 4486, 3068, 1815, 5831, 5158, 1641, 2, 613, 226, 420, 9069, 4, 7, 5, 131, 2, 2193, 1479, 836, 6, 300, 99, 17, 932, 5001, 5, 2252, 3589, 8, 124, 316, 160, 90, 23, 46, 74, 303, 195, 1107, 9069, 128, 4, 1479]",1631.0,22067397,184
Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging as a prognostic factor in predicting event-free and overall survival in pediatric patients with osteosarcoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2011-12-16,"The objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) as an early imaging indicator of tumor histologic response to preoperative chemotherapy and as a possible prognostic factor for event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed, nonmetastatic osteosarcoma who were treated on a single, multi-institutional phase 2 trial. Three serial DCE-MRI examinations at week 0 (before treatment), week 9, and week 12 (tumor resection) were performed in 69 patients with nonmetastatic osteosarcoma to monitor the response to preoperative chemotherapy. Four DCE-MRI kinetic parameters (the influx volume transfer constant [K(trans) ], the efflux rate constant [k(ep) ], the relative extravascular extracellular space [v(e) ], and the relative vascular plasma space [v(p) ]) and the corresponding differences (ΔK(trans) , Δk(ep) , Δv(e) , and Δv(p) ) of averaged kinetic parameters between the outer and inner halves of tumors were calculated to assess their associations with tumor histologic response, EFS, and overall survival. The parameters K(trans) , v(e) , v(p) , and k(ep) decreased significantly from week 0 to week 9 and week 12. The parameters K(trans) , v(p) , and Δk(ep) at week 9 were significantly different between responders and nonresponders (P = .046, P = .021, and P = .008, respectively). These 3 parameters were indicative of histologic response. The parameter Δv(e) at week 0 was a significant prognostic factor for both EFS (P = .02) and overall survival (P = .03). DCE-MRI was identified as a prognostic factor for EFS and overall survival before treatment on this trial and was indicative of a histologic response to neoadjuvant therapy. Further studies are needed to verify these findings with other treatment regimens and establish the potential role of DCE-MRI in the development of risk-adapted therapy for osteosarcoma.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",2958.0,56.0,The objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging DCE-MRI as an early imaging indicator of tumor histologic response to preoperative chemotherapy and as a possible prognostic factor for event-free survival EFS and overall survival in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed nonmetastatic who were treated on a single multi-institutional phase 2 trial Three serial DCE-MRI examinations at week 0 before treatment week 9 and week 12 tumor resection were performed in 69 patients with nonmetastatic to monitor the response to preoperative chemotherapy Four DCE-MRI kinetic parameters the influx volume transfer constant K trans the efflux rate constant k ep the relative extravascular extracellular space v e and the relative vascular plasma space v p and the corresponding differences ΔK trans Δk ep Δv e and Δv p of averaged kinetic parameters between the outer and inner halves of tumors were calculated to assess their associations with tumor histologic response EFS and overall survival The parameters K trans v e v p and k ep decreased significantly from week 0 to week 9 and week 12 The parameters K trans v p and Δk ep at week 9 were significantly different between responders and nonresponders P .046 P .021 and P .008 respectively These 3 parameters were indicative of histologic response The parameter Δv e at week 0 was a significant prognostic factor for both EFS P .02 and overall survival P .03 DCE-MRI was identified as a prognostic factor for EFS and overall survival before treatment on this trial and was indicative of a histologic response to neoadjuvant therapy Further studies are needed to verify these findings with other treatment regimens and establish the potential role of DCE-MRI in the development of risk-adapted therapy for,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 461, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 1143, 376, 2540, 748, 651, 1484, 1535, 270, 4228, 704, 22, 35, 191, 270, 3287, 1, 30, 884, 51, 6, 498, 56, 2, 22, 8, 899, 177, 161, 9, 774, 115, 25, 1683, 2, 63, 25, 4, 815, 7, 5, 732, 265, 2683, 54, 11, 73, 23, 8, 226, 1414, 1115, 124, 18, 160, 169, 2108, 4228, 704, 4209, 28, 647, 13, 348, 24, 647, 83, 2, 647, 133, 30, 170, 11, 173, 4, 790, 7, 5, 2683, 6, 3334, 3, 51, 6, 498, 56, 294, 4228, 704, 7009, 1038, 3, 11560, 433, 2602, 4982, 1634, 3437, 3, 7043, 116, 4982, 1634, 4921, 3, 580, 17695, 1976, 3865, 603, 563, 2, 3, 580, 756, 554, 3865, 603, 19, 2, 3, 1734, 362, 29232, 3437, 29232, 4921, 21699, 563, 2, 21699, 19, 1, 6893, 7009, 1038, 59, 3, 7808, 2, 7938, 24577, 1, 57, 11, 981, 6, 423, 136, 685, 5, 30, 884, 51, 1683, 2, 63, 25, 3, 1038, 1634, 3437, 603, 563, 603, 19, 2, 1634, 4921, 340, 97, 29, 647, 13, 6, 647, 83, 2, 647, 133, 3, 1038, 1634, 3437, 603, 19, 2, 29232, 4921, 28, 647, 83, 11, 97, 338, 59, 1983, 2, 4498, 19, 4902, 19, 4630, 2, 19, 2155, 106, 46, 27, 1038, 11, 5572, 1, 884, 51, 3, 4219, 21699, 563, 28, 647, 13, 10, 8, 93, 177, 161, 9, 110, 1683, 19, 588, 2, 63, 25, 19, 680, 4228, 704, 10, 108, 22, 8, 177, 161, 9, 1683, 2, 63, 25, 348, 24, 23, 26, 160, 2, 10, 5572, 1, 8, 884, 51, 6, 536, 36, 195, 94, 32, 575, 6, 6355, 46, 272, 5, 127, 24, 472, 2, 1811, 3, 174, 200, 1, 4228, 704, 4, 3, 193, 1, 43, 3716, 36, 9]",1813.0,22180392,10

Outcome for adolescent and young adult patients with osteosarcoma: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.,Cancer,Cancer,2012-01-17,"There are conflicting data regarding age as a prognostic factor in osteosarcoma. The authors conducted a study evaluating the impact of age on prognosis in children and young adults with osteosarcoma enrolled on North American cooperative group trials. Patients with high-grade osteosarcoma of any site enrolled on North American cooperative group trials CCG-7943, POG-9754, INT-0133, and AOST0121 were included in this study. Primary tumor site, age, sex, ethnicity, histologic response, and presence of metastatic disease at diagnosis were evaluated for their impact on overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS). A total of 1054 patients were eligible and had complete data available for the study. Age was not significantly associated with any other presenting covariate analyzed except sex. Age 18 or older was associated with a statistically significant poorer EFS (P = .019) and OS (P = .043). The 10-year EFS and OS in patients <10, 10 to 17, and ≥18 years old were 55%, 55%, 37% and 68%, 60%, 41%, respectively. The poorer EFS in patients ≥18 years old was because of an increased rate of relapse. Presence of metastatic disease at diagnosis, poor histologic response, and pelvic tumor site were also associated with a poorer prognosis. In multivariate analysis, age continued to be associated with poorer EFS (P = .019) and OS (P = .049).

We sought to determine whether GLV-1h68 could selectively target and lyse a panel of human bone and soft-tissue sarcoma cell lines in vitro and in vivo. GLV-1h68 was tested in a panel of four cell lines including: fibrosarcoma HT-1080, osteosarcoma U-2OS, fibrohistiocytoma M-805, and rhabdomyosarcoma HTB-82. Gene expression, infectivity, viral proliferation, and cytotoxicity were characterized in vitro. HT-1080 xenograft flank tumors grown in vivo were injected intratumorally with a single dose of GLV-1h68. All four cell lines supported robust viral transgene expression in vitro. At a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of five, GLV-1h68 was cytotoxic to three cell lines, resulting in >80% cytotoxicity over 7 d. In vivo, a single injection of GLV-1h68 into HT-1080 xenografts exhibited localized intratumoral luciferase activity peaking at d 2-4, with gradual resolution over 8 d and no evidence of spread to normal tissues.

"Phase II study of sequential gemcitabine followed by docetaxel for recurrent Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, or unresectable or locally recurrent chondrosarcoma: results of Sarcoma Alliance for Research Through Collaboration Study 003.",The oncologist,Oncologist,2012-02-23,"Gemcitabine and docetaxel have a broad spectrum of clinical activity in patients with carcinoma. The Sarcoma Alliance for Research Through Collaboration conducted a phase II trial of gemcitabine in combination with docetaxel in children and adults with recurrent Ewing sarcoma (EWS), osteosarcoma (OS), or unresectable or recurrent chondrosarcoma. The primary objective was to determine the objective response rate using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST). Gemcitabine (675 mg/m2 i.v. over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8) was administered in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m2 i.v. over 1 hour on day 8) every 21 days. All patients received filgrastim or pegfilgrastim. A Bayesian formulation was used to determine the probability of achieving the target response rate for each subtype-0.35 for EWS and OS or 0.20 for chondrosarcoma. If the probability of achieving the target response rate was <0.05, the combination was considered inactive. Toxicity was graded according to common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE), version 3.0. Fifty-three eligible patients were enrolled in the three subtype groups-OS (n = 14), EWS (n = 14), and chondrosarcoma (n = 25). Toxicities included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, dyspnea, bronchospasm, edema, neuropathy, and liver function abnormalities. Dose modification for toxicity was required for eight patients during cycle 1 and 16 patients in subsequent cycles. Seven patients withdrew from therapy as a result of toxicity. No complete responses were observed. Partial responses were observed in OS (n = 1), EWS (n = 2), and chondrosarcoma (n = 2) patients. Gemcitabine in combination with docetaxel was associated with a probability of reaching the target 35% response rate of <5% in OS patients and 5.6% in EWS patients; the probability of reaching a 20% response rate in chondrosarcoma patients was 14%. The Bayesian formulation permitted estimation of the probability of achieving the target response rate for each subtype after each response evaluation. By allowing multiple looks at the data, this design stopped the trial after considering the probability of achieving the target response rate and accrual rate. Because this design did not specify a rule for declaring the treatment as ""active"", a direct comparison with a standard two-stage phase II design is not appropriate. The decision to close the EWS and chondrosarcoma subtype arms was based, in part, on slow accrual and was supported by the low probability of achieving the target response rate.

The design of MARQUEE is based on preclinical data, the current understanding of the role of cellular N-methyl-N'-nitroso-guanidine human osteosarcoma (MNNG HOS) transforming gene (MET) in NSCLC, and clinical data from a randomized phase II study. The available evidence suggests that dual inhibition of MET and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) may overcome resistance to EGFR inhibitors. In the phase II study, the combination of tivantinib plus erlotinib significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with placebo plus erlotinib in the subset of patients with nonsquamous histology, a population enriched for MET overexpression. The primary endpoint in MARQUEE is OS. Secondary and exploratory objectives include determination of PFS, OS in molecular subgroups (defined by EGFR and KRAS mutation status, amplification or overexpression of MET, and serum hepatocyte growth factor), and safety.

Establishment and characterization of a novel chordoma cell line: CH22.,Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,J. Orthop. Res.,2012-04-13,"Chordoma is a rare primary malignant bone tumor and there exist only a few established human chordoma cell lines. The scarcity of robust chordoma cell lines has limited the ability to study this tumor. In this report, we describe the establishment of a novel chordoma cell line and characterize its in vitro and in vivo behaviors. The tumor tissue was isolated from a patient with recurrent chordoma of the sacrum. After 6 months in culture, the chordoma cell line, referred here as CH22, was established. Microscopic analysis of two-dimensional culture confirmed that the CH22 cells exhibited a typical vacuolated cytoplasm similar to the well-established chordoma cell line U-CH1. Electron microscopy showed cohesive cells with numerous surface filopodia, pockets of glycogen and aggregates of intermediate tonofilaments in cytoplasm. Three-dimensional culture revealed that the CH22 cells could grow and form clusters by day 8. The MTT assays demonstrated that, compared with sensitive osteosarcoma cell lines, CH22 cells were relatively resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that the CH22 cells expressed brachyury, vimentin, and cytokeratin. Finally, histological analysis of CH22 xenograft tumor tissues demonstrated the appearance of physaliphorous cells and positive staining of brachyury, cytokeratin, and S100. By CT and MRI, imaging xenografts showed the typical appearances seen in human chordomas. These findings suggest that the established novel human chordoma cell line CH22 and its tumorigenecity in SCID nude mice may serve as an important model for studying chordoma cell biology and the development of new therapeutic modalities.",Journal Article,2839.0,19.0,Chordoma is a rare primary malignant tumor and there exist only a few established human chordoma cell lines The scarcity of robust chordoma cell lines has limited the ability to study this tumor In this report we describe the establishment of a novel chordoma cell line and characterize its in vitro and in vivo behaviors The tumor tissue was isolated from a patient with recurrent chordoma of the sacrum After 6 months in culture the chordoma cell line referred here as CH22 was established Microscopic analysis of two-dimensional culture confirmed that the CH22 cells exhibited a typical vacuolated cytoplasm similar to the well-established chordoma cell line U-CH1 Electron microscopy showed cohesive cells with numerous surface filopodia pockets of glycogen and aggregates of intermediate tonofilaments in cytoplasm Three-dimensional culture revealed that the CH22 cells could grow and form clusters by day 8 The MTT assays demonstrated that compared with sensitive cell lines CH22 cells were relatively resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that the CH22 cells expressed brachyury vimentin and cytokeratin Finally histological analysis of CH22 xenograft tumor tissues demonstrated the appearance of physaliphorous cells and positive staining of brachyury cytokeratin and S100 By CT and MRI imaging xenografts showed the typical appearances seen in human chordomas These findings suggest that the established novel human chordoma cell line CH22 and its tumorigenecity in SCID nude mice may serve as an important model for studying chordoma cell biology and the development of new therapeutic modalities,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3911, 16, 8, 622, 86, 393, 30, 2, 125, 1923, 158, 8, 1021, 635, 171, 3911, 31, 285, 3, 16074, 1, 1922, 3911, 31, 285, 71, 383, 3, 801, 6, 45, 26, 30, 4, 26, 414, 21, 897, 3, 5346, 1, 8, 229, 3911, 31, 328, 2, 1507, 211, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 3704, 3, 30, 246, 10, 1355, 29, 8, 69, 5, 387, 3911, 1, 3, 11629, 50, 49, 53, 4, 2099, 3, 3911, 31, 328, 1995, 467, 22, 27176, 10, 635, 2984, 65, 1, 100, 2201, 2099, 557, 17, 3, 27176, 37, 1416, 8, 3476, 26325, 4558, 288, 6, 3, 149, 635, 3911, 31, 328, 1767, 31958, 4560, 3804, 224, 21497, 37, 5, 2331, 1255, 19423, 26997, 1, 9482, 2, 9586, 1, 919, 61340, 4, 4558, 169, 2201, 2099, 553, 17, 3, 27176, 37, 359, 6265, 2, 1297, 3780, 20, 218, 66, 3, 4988, 1013, 264, 17, 72, 5, 745, 31, 285, 27176, 37, 11, 1352, 436, 6, 809, 1573, 600, 1521, 3661, 2, 4130, 65, 557, 17, 3, 27176, 37, 570, 19979, 4840, 2, 4292, 1368, 1831, 65, 1, 27176, 1330, 30, 742, 264, 3, 3592, 1, 61341, 37, 2, 109, 1029, 1, 19979, 4292, 2, 11456, 20, 425, 2, 704, 270, 1348, 224, 3, 3476, 15559, 527, 4, 171, 6790, 46, 272, 309, 17, 3, 635, 229, 171, 3911, 31, 328, 27176, 2, 211, 30769, 4, 4129, 2598, 399, 68, 1833, 22, 35, 305, 202, 9, 4559, 3911, 31, 891, 2, 3, 193, 1, 217, 189, 1558]",1676.0,22504929,170
Common musculoskeletal tumors of childhood and adolescence.,Mayo Clinic proceedings,Mayo Clin.

Numerous factors have contributed to improved outcome for these patients over the past several decades. These include multidisciplinary care involving oncologists, radiation oncologists, surgeons, pathologists, and radiologists and enrollment of patients in clinical trials. Better understanding of molecular mechanisms of disease have resulted in studies using molecular targets in addition to standard chemotherapeutic agents, which hopefully will lead to better outcomes in the future. Moreover, new orthopedic techniques and devices as well as new technologies in radiation oncology hold promise for better local control of primary tumors and the potential for fewer late adverse effects. Despite this progress, patients must undergo lifelong follow-up for possible late effects of intense chemotherapy and radiation therapy. We review the diagnosis, prognosis, staging, multidisciplinary therapy, new directions in therapy, and long-term complications of treatment for these tumors.

P16 expression predicts necrotic response among patients with osteosarcoma receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2012-05-09,"Although pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is highly correlated with survival among patients with osteosarcoma, there are currently no established molecular markers to predict response to chemotherapy. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship of P16 expression in pretreatment osteosarcoma tumors to pathologic necrotic response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A tissue microarray was created from paraffin-embedded pretreatment biopsy specimens of 40 patients with osteosarcoma. Immunohistochemistry was performed with commercially available P16 monoclonal mouse antibody. Expression of P16 was defined as nuclear staining in 30% or greater of cells. Percent tumor necrosis was measured in postchemotherapy resection specimens per established protocols, and 90% or greater tumor necrosis was considered ""good.""

"MDM2 binding protein, a novel metastasis suppressor.",Cancer metastasis reviews,Cancer Metastasis Rev.,2012-12-01,"MDM2 binding protein (MTBP) is a protein that interacts with oncoprotein murine double minute (MDM2), a major inhibitor of the tumor suppressor p53. Overexpression of MTBP leads to p53-independent cell proliferation arrest, which is in turn blocked by simultaneous overexpression of MDM2. Importantly, reduced expression of MTBP in mice increases tumor metastasis and enhances migratory potential of mouse embryonic fibroblasts regardless of the presence of p53. Clinically, loss of MTBP expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is associated with reduced patient survival, and is shown to serve as an independent prognostic factor when p53 is mutated in tumors. These results indicate the involvement of MTBP in suppressing tumor progression. Our recent findings demonstrate that overexpression of MTBP in human osteosarcoma cells lacking wild-type p53 inhibits metastasis, but not primary tumor growth, when cells are transplanted in femurs of immunocompromised mice. These data indicate that MTBP functions as a metastasis suppressor independent of p53 status. Furthermore, overexpression of MTBP suppresses cell migration and filopodia formation, in part, by inhibiting function of an actin crosslinking protein α-actinin-4. Thus, increasing evidence indicates the significance of MTBP in tumor progression. We summarize published results related to MTBP function and discuss caveats and future directions in this review article.",Journal Article,2607.0,11.0,MDM2 binding protein MTBP is a protein that interacts with oncoprotein murine double minute MDM2 a major inhibitor of the tumor suppressor p53 Overexpression of MTBP leads to p53-independent cell proliferation arrest which is in turn blocked by simultaneous overexpression of MDM2 Importantly reduced expression of MTBP in mice increases tumor metastasis and enhances migratory potential of mouse embryonic fibroblasts regardless of the presence of p53 Clinically loss of MTBP expression in head and squamous cell carcinoma is associated with reduced patient survival and is shown to serve as an independent prognostic factor when p53 is mutated in tumors These results indicate the involvement of MTBP in suppressing tumor progression Our recent findings demonstrate that overexpression of MTBP in human cells lacking wild-type p53 inhibits metastasis but not primary tumor growth when cells are transplanted in femurs of immunocompromised mice These data indicate that MTBP functions as a metastasis suppressor independent of p53 status Furthermore overexpression of MTBP suppresses cell migration and filopodia formation in part by inhibiting function of an actin crosslinking protein α-actinin-4 Thus increasing evidence indicates the significance of MTBP in tumor progression We summarize published results related to MTBP function and discuss caveats and future directions in this review article,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3277, 791, 178, 15422, 16, 8, 178, 17, 5528, 5, 6159, 1471, 1627, 3949, 3277, 8, 458, 230, 1, 3, 30, 1245, 624, 851, 1, 15422, 1940, 6, 624, 306, 31, 457, 1854, 92, 16, 4, 3854, 2582, 20, 2824, 851, 1, 3277, 1859, 405, 55, 1, 15422, 4, 399, 1106, 30, 278, 2, 2519, 7757, 174, 1, 830, 5390, 3921, 1583, 1, 3, 463, 1, 624, 505, 407, 1, 15422, 55, 4, 718, 2, 691, 31, 134, 16, 41, 5, 405, 69, 25, 2, 16, 443, 6, 1833, 22, 35, 306, 177, 161, 198, 624, 16, 1185, 4, 57, 46, 99, 1008, 3, 799, 1, 15422, 4, 4669, 30, 91, 114, 435, 272, 608, 17, 851, 1, 15422, 4, 171, 37, 1941, 955, 267, 624, 1576, 278, 84, 44, 86, 30, 129, 198, 37, 32, 4600, 4, 29071, 1, 7796, 399, 46, 74, 1008, 17, 15422, 1681, 22, 8, 278, 1245, 306, 1, 624, 156, 798, 851, 1, 15422, 4079, 31, 1381, 2, 19423, 1264, 4, 760, 20, 2062, 343, 1, 35, 5525, 12984, 178, 2014, 47235, 39, 631, 602, 241, 2640, 3, 724, 1, 15422, 4, 30, 91, 21, 2479, 983, 99, 139, 6, 15422, 343, 2, 1139, 17649, 2, 508, 3540, 4, 26, 206, 946]",1401.0,22684342,185
Patients with osteosarcoma with a single pulmonary nodule on computed tomography: a single-institution experience.,Journal of pediatric surgery,J. Pediatr.

Patients with no evidence of disease at the end of initial therapy who subsequently relapsed in the lung were identified. In our study, 16 (8%) of 198 patients with OS with metachronous metastatic pulmonary disease presented with a SPN on CT scan. In all patients, only 1 metastatic nodule for OS was found at the time of thoracotomy. The median time between diagnosis and first lung relapse was 23.8 months (range, 4-80 months). Eleven patients (68.7%) subsequently had a second lung relapse, but only 3 patients had involvement of the ipsilateral lung (mean time interval between first and second pulmonary relapses of 17 months; range, 2-44 months). Five-year overall survival from diagnosis was 56.2%. Seven patients (43.8%) died of disease progression.

Systematic kinome shRNA screening identifies CDK11 (PITSLRE) kinase expression is critical for osteosarcoma cell growth and proliferation.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2012-07-12,"Identification of new targeted therapies is critical to improving the survival rate of patients with osteosarcoma. The goal of this study is to identify kinase based potential therapeutic target in osteosarcomas. We used a lentiviral-based shRNA kinase library to screen for kinases which play a role in osteosarcoma cell survival. The cell proliferation assay was used to evaluate cell growth and survival. siRNA assays were applied to confirm the observed phenotypic changes resulting from the loss of kinase gene expression. CDK11 (PITSLRE) was identified as essential for the survival of osteosarcoma cells, and its expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Overall patient survival was correlated with the CDK11 expression and its prognosis. The role of CDK11 expression in sustaining osteosarcoma growth was further evaluated in an osteosarcoma xenograft model in vivo. Osteosarcoma cells display high levels of CDK11 expression. CDK11 expression knocked down by either lentiviral shRNA or siRNA inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that patients with osteosarcoma with high CDK11 tumor expression levels were associated with significantly shorter survival than patients with osteosarcoma with low level of tumor CDK11 expression. Systemic in vivo administration of in vivo ready siRNA of CDK11 reduced the tumor growth in an osteosarcoma subcutaneous xenograft model.

Expression and significance of Kruppel-like factor 6 gene in osteosarcoma.,International orthopaedics,Int Orthop,2012-08-02,"Osteosarcoma is primary malignant tumour of bone. Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) is a tumor suppressor gene frequently inactivated in a number of human cancers and a ubiquitously expressed zinc-finger transcription factor.

Targeting hedgehog-GLI-2 pathway in osteosarcoma.,Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,J. Orthop. Res.,2012-09-11,"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant tumor of bone. Patients with localized osteosarcoma are routinely treated with chemotherapy and surgery. However, many of these patients eventually relapse after these treatments. In such cases, there are limited treatment options for these patients and most will eventually die with metastatic disease. Therefore, it is imperative to identify better therapeutic strategies. Hedgehog-GLI is responsible for the development of vertebrate embryonic and tumorigenesis. Specifically, the transcription factor, GLI-2, plays a key role in development of normal prostate. Aberrant activation of GLI-2 is correlated with various malignancies. We observe that GLI-2 is highly expressed in osteosarcoma cell lines, and this correlates with poor clinical outcomes in patients. Knockdown of GLI-2 by siRNA decreases osteosarcoma cell proliferation and viability, which eventually induces cell death as revealed in both in 2D and 3D cultures. In addition, we notice that administration of GLI-2 siRNA can increase the sensitivity of osteosarcoma cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. These findings suggest GLI-2 is required for osteosarcoma cell proliferation and survival.

A multi-center phase Ib study of oxaliplatin (NSC#266046) in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin in pediatric patients with advanced solid tumors.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2012-09-28,"Platinum agents have been used for a variety of cancers, including pivotal use in pediatric tumors for many years. Oxaliplatin, a third generation platinum, has a different side effect profile and may provide improved activity in pediatric cancers. Patients 21 years or younger with progressive or refractory malignant solid tumors, including tumors of the central nervous system were enrolled on this multi-center open label, non-randomized Phase 1 dose escalation study. The study used a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design with 2 dose levels (85 and 100 mg/m(2) ) with an expansion cohort of 15 additional patients at the recommended dose. Patients received oxaliplatin at the assigned dose level and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) bolus 400 mg/m(2)  followed by a 46-hour 5-FU infusion of 2,400 mg/m(2)  every 14 days. The leucovorin dose was fixed at 400 mg/m(2)  for all cohorts. Thirty-one evaluable patients were enrolled, 8 at 85 mg/m(2)  and 23 at 100 mg/m(2)  for a total of 121 courses. The median age was 12 years (range 2-19 years). The main toxicities were hematologic, primarily neutrophils and platelets. The most common non-hematologic toxicities were gastrointestinal. Stable disease was noted in 11 patients (54% of evaluable patients) and 1 confirmed partial response in a patient with osteosarcoma. The maximum planned dose of oxaliplatin at 100 mg/m(2)  per dose in combination with 5-FU and leucovorin was safe and well tolerated and in this patient population. This combination demonstrated modest activity in patients with refractory or relapsed solid tumor and warrants further study.

Phase I trial and pharmacokinetic study of lexatumumab in pediatric patients with solid tumors.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2012-10-15,"Lexatumumab is an agonistic, fully human monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 2 with preclinical evidence of activity in pediatric solid tumors. This phase I dose-escalation study examined the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of lexatumumab at doses up to, but not exceeding, the adult maximum-tolerated dose (3, 5, 8, and 10 mg/kg), administered once every 2 weeks to patients age≤21 years with recurrent or progressive solid tumors. Twenty-four patients received a total of 56 cycles of lexatumumab over all four planned dose levels. One patient had grade 2 pericarditis consistent with radiation recall, and one patient developed grade 3 pneumonia with hypoxia during the second cycle. Five patients experienced stable disease for three to 24 cycles. No patients experienced complete or partial response, but several showed evidence of antitumor activity, including one patient with recurrent progressive osteosarcoma who experienced resolution of clinical symptoms and positron emission tomography activity, ongoing more than 1 year off therapy.

Inhaled lipid cisplatin (ILC) in the treatment of patients with relapsed/progressive osteosarcoma metastatic to the lung.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2012-12-19,"Osteosarcoma treatment failure is most often from the inability to control metastatic disease in the lungs. Encapsulating cisplatin within lipid complexes and delivering the agent via inhalation targets lung metastases with minimal systemic exposure. An open-label, phase Ib/IIa study was performed to characterize the safety and efficacy of inhaled lipid cisplatin (ILC) in recurrent osteosarcoma patients who only had pulmonary metastases. ILC was administered via nebulizer every 2 weeks (=1 cycle). Response was evaluated radiographically every 2 cycles. Cisplatin levels were measured in patients. When possible, metastasectomy was undertaken in patients after 2 cycles. Nineteen patients were treated. No patients experienced hematologic toxicity, nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity. Nausea/vomiting (≥grade 3) was attributed to study drug in one patient. Respiratory symptoms were observed in 13/19 patients with only one patient experiencing a ≥grade 3 respiratory symptom (not related to study drug). Systemic cisplatin exposure was minimal. Eleven patients had bulky disease, and all progressed prior to cycle 7. Eight patients had all lesions ≤2 cm. One patient had a sustained partial response. An additional two patients had stable disease after 2 cycles, underwent metastasectomy, and remained free from pulmonary recurrence 1 year after initiation of therapy.

Survival of pediatric patients after relapsed osteosarcoma: the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital experience.,Cancer,Cancer,2013-04-26,"Chemotherapy has improved the outcome of patients with newly diagnosed osteosarcoma, but its role in relapsed disease is unclear. We reviewed the records of all patients who were treated for relapsed high-grade osteosarcoma at our institution between 1970 and 2004. Postrelapse event-free survival (PREFS) and postrelapse survival (PRS) were estimated, and outcome comparisons were made using an exact log-rank test. The 10-year PREFS and PRS of the 110 patients were 11.8% ± 3.5% and 17.0% ± 4.3%, respectively. Metastasis at initial diagnosis (14%), and relapse in lung only (75%) were not significantly associated with PREFS or PRS. Time from initial diagnosis to first relapse (RL1) ≥18 months (43%), surgery at RL1 (76%), and ability to achieve second complete remission (CR2, 56%) were favorably associated with PREFS and PRS (P  ≤  0.0002). In patients without CR2, chemotherapy at RL1 was favorably associated with PREFS (P = 0.01) but not with PRS. In patients with lung relapse only, unilateral relapse and number of nodules ( ≤ 3) were associated with better PREFS and PRS (P  ≤  0.0005); no patients with bilateral relapse survived 10 years. The median PREFS after treatment with cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and ifosfamide was 3.5 months (95% confidence interval, 2.1-5.2), and the median PRS was 8.2 months (95% confidence interval, 5.2-15.1). Late relapse, surgical resection, and unilateral involvement (in lung relapse only) favorably impact outcome after relapse.

Role of epigenetic modulation for the treatment of sarcoma.,Current treatment options in oncology,Curr Treat Options Oncol,2013-09-01,"Sarcoma is a disease that includes many different subtypes that can present with a wide range of differing clinical findings, prognosis, and treatment options. For certain subsets (e.g., Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor [GIST]), extensive clinical trials have delineated effective treatment regimens often involving combination therapy, including surgery, radiation, systemic chemotherapy, and small molecular inhibitors of tyrosine kinases (as in the case of GIST). For nearly all patients with sarcoma who have relapsed or developed metastasis, the therapeutic benefit of chemotherapy has reached a plateau and as such new treatment approaches are needed to move this field forward. We recommend that all patients have the opportunity to participate in clinical trials where available. Recently, in our clinic we have started to increase our use of molecular testing and DNA sequencing studies to help identify potential treatment options for patients. One area of evolving basic and clinical research in sarcomas is the field of epigenetic therapeutics.

Comparative analysis of the surface exposed proteome of two canine osteosarcoma cell lines and normal canine osteoblasts.,BMC veterinary research,BMC Vet. Res.,2013-06-13,"Osteosarcoma (OSA) is the most common primary bone tumor of dogs and carries a poor prognosis despite aggressive treatment. An improved understanding of the biology of OSA is critically needed to allow for development of novel diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tools. The surface-exposed proteome (SEP) of a cancerous cell includes a multifarious array of proteins critical to cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, adhesion, and inter-cellular communication. The specific aim of this study was to define a SEP profile of two validated canine OSA cell lines and a normal canine osteoblast cell line utilizing a biotinylation/streptavidin system to selectively label, purify, and identify surface-exposed proteins by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Additionally, we sought to validate a subset of our MS-based observations via quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot and semi-quantitative immunocytochemistry. Our hypothesis was that MS would detect differences in the SEP composition between the OSA and the normal osteoblast cells. Shotgun MS identified 133 putative surface proteins when output from all samples were combined, with good consistency between biological replicates. Eleven of the MS-detected proteins underwent analysis of gene expression by PCR, all of which were actively transcribed, but varied in expression level. Western blot of whole cell lysates from all three cell lines was effective for Thrombospondin-1, CYR61 and CD44, and indicated that all three proteins were present in each cell line. Semi-quantitative immunofluorescence indicated that CD44 was expressed at much higher levels on the surface of the OSA than the normal osteoblast cell lines. The results of the present study identified numerous differences, and similarities, in the SEP of canine OSA cell lines and normal canine osteoblasts. The PCR, Western blot, and immunocytochemistry results, for the subset of proteins evaluated, were generally supportive of the mass spectrometry data. These methods may be applied to other cell lines, or other biological materials, to highlight unique and previously unrecognized differences between samples. While this study yielded data that may prove useful for OSA researchers and clinicians, further refinements of the described techniques are expected to yield greater accuracy and produce a more thorough SEP analysis.",Comparative Study,2413.0,5.0,OSA is the most common primary tumor of dogs and carries a poor prognosis despite aggressive treatment An improved understanding of the biology of OSA is critically needed to allow for development of novel diagnostic prognostic and therapeutic tools The surface-exposed proteome SEP of a cancerous cell includes a multifarious array of proteins critical to cellular processes such as proliferation migration adhesion and inter-cellular communication The specific aim of this study was to define a SEP profile of two validated canine OSA cell lines and a normal canine osteoblast cell line utilizing a biotinylation/streptavidin system to selectively label purify and identify surface-exposed proteins by mass spectrometry MS analysis Additionally we sought to validate a subset of our MS-based observations via quantitative real-time PCR Western blot and semi-quantitative immunocytochemistry Our hypothesis was that MS would detect differences in the SEP composition between the OSA and the normal osteoblast cells Shotgun MS identified 133 putative surface proteins when output from all samples were combined with good consistency between biological replicates Eleven of the MS-detected proteins underwent analysis of gene expression by PCR all of which were actively transcribed but varied in expression level Western blot of whole cell lysates from all three cell lines was effective for Thrombospondin-1 CYR61 and CD44 and indicated that all three proteins were present in each cell line Semi-quantitative immunofluorescence indicated that CD44 was expressed at much higher levels on the surface of the OSA than the normal osteoblast cell lines The results of the present study identified numerous differences and similarities in the SEP of canine OSA cell lines and normal canine osteoblasts The PCR Western blot and immunocytochemistry results for the subset of proteins evaluated were generally supportive of the mass spectrometry data These methods may be applied to other cell lines or other biological materials to highlight unique and previously unrecognized differences between samples While this study yielded data that may prove useful for OSA researchers and clinicians further refinements of the described techniques are expected to yield greater accuracy and produce a more thorough SEP analysis,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[14031, 16, 3, 96, 186, 86, 30, 1, 7539, 2, 4942, 8, 334, 356, 550, 571, 24, 35, 231, 612, 1, 3, 891, 1, 14031, 16, 4331, 575, 6, 1700, 9, 193, 1, 229, 752, 177, 2, 189, 1896, 3, 1255, 2234, 9895, 21759, 1, 8, 5483, 31, 1920, 8, 40388, 1926, 1, 652, 740, 6, 763, 1849, 225, 22, 457, 1381, 2128, 2, 3606, 763, 2063, 3, 112, 1130, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 1107, 8, 21759, 800, 1, 100, 938, 9099, 14031, 31, 285, 2, 8, 295, 9099, 7418, 31, 328, 2600, 8, 62913, 17261, 398, 6, 2382, 1756, 28074, 2, 255, 1255, 2234, 652, 20, 782, 3680, 2307, 65, 1724, 21, 990, 6, 2183, 8, 697, 1, 114, 2307, 90, 2172, 847, 1156, 1589, 98, 604, 1521, 2639, 2, 6399, 1156, 13290, 114, 1492, 10, 17, 2307, 688, 1426, 362, 4, 3, 21759, 3761, 59, 3, 14031, 2, 3, 295, 7418, 37, 26798, 2307, 108, 5026, 2743, 1255, 652, 198, 6911, 29, 62, 347, 11, 397, 5, 1178, 5358, 59, 1037, 10579, 2627, 1, 3, 2307, 530, 652, 208, 65, 1, 145, 55, 20, 604, 62, 1, 92, 11, 4489, 10088, 84, 2051, 4, 55, 301, 1521, 2639, 1, 902, 31, 8674, 29, 62, 169, 31, 285, 10, 323, 9, 12596, 14, 22271, 2, 3035, 2, 1103, 17, 62, 169, 652, 11, 364, 4, 296, 31, 328, 6399, 1156, 4130, 1103, 17, 3035, 10, 570, 28, 1802, 142, 148, 23, 3, 1255, 1, 3, 14031, 76, 3, 295, 7418, 31, 285, 3, 99, 1, 3, 364, 45, 108, 2331, 362, 2, 6089, 4, 3, 21759, 1, 9099, 14031, 31, 285, 2, 295, 9099, 5965, 3, 604, 1521, 2639, 2, 13290, 99, 9, 3, 697, 1, 652, 194, 11, 1228, 1877, 1, 3, 782, 3680, 74, 46, 636, 68, 40, 1498, 6, 127, 31, 285, 15, 127, 1037, 5102, 6, 1817, 991, 2, 373, 6055, 362, 59, 347, 369, 26, 45, 2178, 74, 17, 68, 4361, 999, 9, 14031, 4211, 2, 1490, 195, 10518, 1, 3, 1027, 1092, 32, 1336, 6, 2309, 378, 1190, 2, 2410, 8, 80, 5506, 21759, 65]",2313.0,23758893,91

We investigated incidence, patient characteristics and survival for patients with osteosarcoma and regional lymph node involvement at diagnosis. We identified 2748 cases of high-grade osteosarcoma with available information regarding regional lymph node involvement in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database from 1973 to 2009. Demographics were compared using chi-squared tests or t-tests. Overall survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and compared with log-rank tests. Multivariate analysis of overall survival was performed using Cox proportional hazards methods. There were 74 patients (2.7%) with regional lymph node involvement at diagnosis of whom 19 (0.7%) were pathologically confirmed. Patients with regional node involvement were more likely to have extraskeletal tumours, distant metastases, tumours arising outside the lower extremity (p<0.0001 for all comparisons) and larger tumours (p=0.033). Five-year overall survival in those with and without regional node involvement was 10.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.6-20.4) and 54.3% (95% CI 52.2-56.4; p<0.0001).

Older age, male sex, decreased baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl) and increased proton pump inhibitor use among the lymphoma population likely contributed to the observed difference.

Efficacy of glucarpidase (carboxypeptidase g2) in patients with acute kidney injury after high-dose methotrexate therapy.,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,2013-10-17,"Because the incidence rate of renal impairment is 2-10% for patients treated with high-dose methotrexate and renal impairment develops in 0-12.4% of patients treated for osteosarcoma, we sought to evaluate the efficacy of glucarpidase, a recently approved drug that rapidly hydrolyzes methotrexate to inactive metabolites, which allows for nonrenal clearance in patients with delayed renal methotrexate elimination. Pooled analysis of efficacy data from four multicenter single-arm compassionate-use clinical trials using protocols from 1993 to 2007. Of 476 patients with renal toxicity and delayed methotrexate elimination who were treated with intravenous glucarpidase for rescue after high-dose methotrexate, 169 patients had at least one preglucarpidase (baseline) plasma methotrexate concentration greater than 1 μmol/L and one postglucarpidase methotrexate concentration measurement by high-performance liquid chromatography and were included in the efficacy analysis; renal recovery was assessed in 436 patients who had at least one recorded preglucarpidase and postglucarpidase serum creatinine concentration measurement. Efficacy was defined as rapid and sustained clinically important reduction (RSCIR) in plasma methotrexate concentration, with a concentration of 1 μmol/L or lower at all postglucarpidase determinations. Median age of efficacy-evaluable patients was 20 years (range 5 weeks-84 years). Osteosarcoma (36%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (27%), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (20%) were the most frequent underlying diagnoses. Median preglucarpidase serum methotrexate was 11.7 μmol/L.

Engineering anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies for cancer immunotherapy.,FEBS letters,FEBS Lett.,2013-12-01,"Ganglioside GD2 is highly expressed on neuroectoderm-derived tumors and sarcomas, including neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, melanoma, small cell lung cancer, brain tumors, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma in children and adolescents, as well as liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma and other soft tissue sarcomas in adults. Since GD2 expression in normal tissues is restricted to the brain, which is inaccessible to circulating antibodies, and in selected peripheral nerves and melanocytes, it was deemed a suitable target for systemic tumor immunotherapy. Anti-GD2 antibodies have been actively tested in clinical trials for neuroblastoma for over the past two decades, with proven safety and efficacy. The main limitations have been acute pain toxicity associated with GD2 expression on peripheral nerve fibers and the inability of antibodies to treat bulky tumor. Several strategies have been developed to reduce pain toxicity, including bypassing complement activation, using blocking antibodies, or targeting of O-acetyl-GD2 derivative that is not expressed on peripheral nerves. To enhance anti-tumor efficacy, anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies and fragments have been engineered into immunocytokines, immunotoxins, antibody drug conjugates, radiolabeled antibodies, targeted nanoparticles, T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptors.

Osteosarcoma treatment - where do we stand? A state of the art review.,Cancer treatment reviews,Cancer Treat. Rev.,2013-11-27,"Long-term outcome for patients with high-grade osteosarcoma has improved with the addition of systemic chemotherapy, but subsequent progress has been less marked. Modern, multiagent, dose-intensive chemotherapy in conjunction with surgery achieves a 5-year event-free survival of 60-70% in extremity localized, non-metastatic disease. A major, as yet unsolved, problem is the poor prognosis for metastatic relapse or recurrence, and for patients with axial disease.

Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) as surveillance for subsequent malignancies in survivors of hereditary retinoblastoma: a pilot study.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2013-11-01,"Individuals with hereditary retinoblastoma (RB) are at very high risk of developing subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs) of which osteosarcoma (OS) is one of the most common. We hypothesized that annual surveillance using whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) in asymptomatic survivors of hereditary RB would detect SMN of the bone and soft tissues at an early stage. Retrospective review of the results of a WB-MRI screening program in hereditary RB survivors from February 2008 to August 2012. The primary outcome was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of WB-MRI in detecting SMNs. Twenty-five patients had at least one WB-MRI performed (range: 1-5). First WB-MRI was performed at a median age of 16 years (range: 8-25 years). WB-MRI detected new osseous abnormalities suspicious for malignancy in five patients: two were diagnosed with localized high-grade OS of the extremity and three were found to have benign osseous abnormalities after dedicated imaging (n = 5/5) and/or biopsy (n = 3/5). One patient was diagnosed with secondary OS 3 months after a normal screening WB-MRI exam. Among a total of 41 WB-MRI screening tests performed in survivors of hereditary RB, the sensitivity of detecting SMN was 66.7% and the specificity was 92.1%.

Population pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab in children with osteosarcoma: implications for dosing.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2014-03-17,"To describe sources of interindividual variability in bevacizumab disposition in pediatric patients and explore associations among bevacizumab pharmacokinetics and clinical wound healing outcomes. Before tumor resection, three doses of bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) were administered to patients (median age, 12.2 years) enrolled in a multi-institutional osteosarcoma trial. Serial sampling for bevacizumab pharmacokinetics was obtained from 27 patients. A population pharmacokinetic model was fit to the data, and patient demographics and clinical chemistry values were systematically tested as predictive covariates on model parameters. Associations between bevacizumab exposure and wound healing status were evaluated by logistic regression. Bevacizumab concentration-time data were adequately described by a two-compartment model. Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates were similar to those previously reported in adults, with a long median (range) terminal half-life of 12.2 days (8.6 to 32.4 days) and a volume of distribution indicating confinement primarily to the vascular space, 49.1 mL/kg (27.1 to 68.3 mL/kg). Body composition was a key determinant of bevacizumab exposure, as body mass index percentile was significantly (P < 0.05) correlated to body-weight normalized clearance and volume of distribution. Furthermore, bevacizumab exposure before primary tumor resection was associated with increased risk of major wound healing complications after surgery (P < 0.05). A population pharmacokinetic model for bevacizumab was developed, which demonstrated that variability in bevacizumab exposure using weight-based dosing is related to body composition.

Here we show that strigolactone analogues inhibit the growth and survival of an array of cancer-derived cell lines representing solid and non-solid cancer cells including: prostate, colon, lung, melanoma, osteosarcoma and leukemic cell lines, while normal cells were minimally affected. Treatment of cancer cells with strigolactone analogues was hallmarked by activation of the stress-related MAPKs: p38 and JNK and induction of stress-related genes; cell cycle arrest and apoptosis evident by increased percentages of cells in the sub-G1 fraction and Annexin V staining. In addition, we tested the response of patient-matched conditionally reprogrammed primary prostate normal and cancer cells. The tumor cells exhibited significantly higher sensitivity to the two most potent SL analogues with increased apoptosis confirmed by PARP1 cleavage compared to their normal counterpart cells. Thus, Strigolactone analogues are promising candidates for anticancer therapy by their ability to specifically induce cell cycle arrest, cellular stress and apoptosis in tumor cells with minimal effects on growth and survival of normal cells.

The Children's Oncology Group therefore embarked on a prospective biology study in a larger sample of patients to define in osteosarcoma the prognostic value of HER-2 expression using the methodology employed in the initial North American study describing an association between HER-2 expression and outcome. The analytic patient population was comprised of 149 patients with newly diagnosed osteosarcoma, 135 with localized disease and 14 with metastatic disease, all of whom had follow up clinical data. Paraffin embedded material from the diagnostic biopsy was stained with CB11 antibody and scored by two independent observers. Correlation of HER-2 IHC score and demographic variables was analyzed using a Fisher's exact test and correlation with survival using a Kaplan-Meier analysis. No association was found with HER-2 status and any of the demographic variables tested including the presence or absence of metastatic disease at diagnosis. No association was found between HER-2 status and either event free survival or overall survival in the patients with localized disease.

We evaluated the long-term effect of metastasectomy on pulmonary function of patients treated for osteosarcoma during childhood. We reviewed the medical records of patients who had pulmonary function tests (PFTs) after metastasectomy for osteosarcoma. Patient, tumor, and treatment variables were abstracted along with PFTs. The PFTs were recorded as a percentage of predicted value and were classified as abnormal for forced vital capacity (FVC) < 80%, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) < 80%, total lung capacity (TLC) < 75%, and single breath diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide corrected for hemoglobin (DLCOcorr) < 75%. Twenty-one patients had PFTs performed during follow-up. Mean age at diagnosis of osteosarcoma was 13.2 ± 4.7 years (SD). Fifteen patients had a single thoracotomy, and 6 patients had ≥2 thoracotomies (range 2 to 6). Eighty lesions were resected. Nine patients had ≤2 lesions resected and 12 patients had >2 lesions (range 3 to 12) resected. Mean time from the last surgical procedure to measurement of PFTs was 20.3 ± 9.0 years (SD).

On the basis of our growing understanding of metastasis biology, it is now reasonable and essential that we focus on developing therapeutics that target metastatic progression. To advance this agenda, a meeting of key opinion leaders and experts in the metastasis and osteosarcoma communities was convened in Bethesda, Maryland. The goal of this meeting was to provide a ""Perspective"" that would establish a preclinical translational path that could support the early evaluation of potential therapeutic agents that uniquely target the metastatic phenotype. Although focused on osteosarcoma, the need for this perspective is shared among many cancer types. The consensus achieved from the meeting included the following: the biology of metastatic progression is associated with metastasis-specific targets/processes that may not influence grossly detectable lesions; targeting of metastasis-specific processes is feasible; rigorous preclinical data are needed to support translation of metastasis-specific agents into human trials where regression of measurable disease is not an expected outcome; preclinical data should include an understanding of mechanism of action, validation of pharmacodynamic markers of effective exposure and response, the use of several murine models of effectiveness, and where feasible the inclusion of the dog with naturally occurring osteosarcoma to define the activity of new drugs in the micrometastatic disease setting.",Journal Article,2086.0,63.0,Despite successful primary tumor treatment the development of pulmonary metastasis continues to be the most common cause of mortality in patients with A conventional drug development path requiring drugs to induce regression of established lesions has not led to improvements for patients with in more than 30 years On the basis of our growing understanding of metastasis biology it is now reasonable and essential that we focus on developing therapeutics that target metastatic progression To advance this agenda a meeting of key opinion leaders and experts in the metastasis and communities was convened in Bethesda Maryland The goal of this meeting was to provide a `` Perspective '' that would establish a preclinical translational path that could support the early evaluation of potential therapeutic agents that uniquely target the metastatic phenotype Although focused on the need for this perspective is shared among many cancer types The consensus achieved from the meeting included the following the biology of metastatic progression is associated with metastasis-specific targets/processes that may not influence grossly detectable lesions targeting of metastasis-specific processes is feasible rigorous preclinical data are needed to support translation of metastasis-specific agents into human trials where regression of measurable disease is not an expected outcome preclinical data should include an understanding of mechanism of action validation of pharmacodynamic markers of effective exposure and response the use of several murine models of effectiveness and where feasible the inclusion of the dog with naturally occurring to define the activity of new drugs in the micrometastatic disease setting,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[550, 1401, 86, 30, 24, 3, 193, 1, 1087, 278, 2274, 6, 40, 3, 96, 186, 708, 1, 282, 4, 7, 5, 8, 809, 234, 193, 6361, 1888, 600, 6, 1290, 320, 1, 635, 406, 71, 44, 836, 6, 1474, 9, 7, 5, 4, 80, 76, 201, 60, 23, 3, 877, 1, 114, 1921, 612, 1, 278, 891, 192, 16, 1134, 3203, 2, 1452, 17, 21, 1222, 23, 931, 1943, 17, 283, 113, 91, 6, 3148, 26, 12402, 8, 2238, 1, 825, 3564, 10353, 2, 3186, 4, 3, 278, 2, 7651, 10, 4440, 4, 8222, 12250, 3, 1326, 1, 26, 2238, 10, 6, 377, 8, 3727, 522, 17, 688, 1811, 8, 693, 2460, 6361, 17, 359, 538, 3, 191, 451, 1, 174, 189, 183, 17, 7089, 283, 3, 113, 1005, 242, 1649, 23, 3, 594, 9, 26, 3727, 16, 2664, 107, 445, 12, 630, 3, 1391, 513, 29, 3, 2238, 159, 3, 366, 3, 891, 1, 113, 91, 16, 41, 5, 278, 112, 637, 1849, 17, 68, 44, 1054, 7185, 2083, 406, 529, 1, 278, 112, 1849, 16, 1313, 6496, 693, 74, 32, 575, 6, 538, 2691, 1, 278, 112, 183, 237, 171, 143, 1257, 320, 1, 1884, 34, 16, 44, 35, 1336, 228, 693, 74, 257, 643, 35, 612, 1, 670, 1, 1578, 929, 1, 2424, 525, 1, 323, 645, 2, 51, 3, 119, 1, 392, 1471, 274, 1, 1236, 2, 1257, 1313, 3, 1680, 1, 3, 16723, 5, 6045, 1821, 6, 1107, 3, 128, 1, 217, 600, 4, 3, 7993, 34, 546]",1718.0,24803583,111
Programmed cell death ligand 1 expression in osteosarcoma.,Cancer immunology research,Cancer Immunol Res,2014-04-21,"Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL1, also known as B7H1) is a cell-surface protein that suppresses the cytotoxic CD8(+) T-cell-mediated immune response. PDL1 expression and its clinical relevance in sarcomas are not well understood. Therefore, we sought to measure RNA expression levels for PDL1 in 38 clinically annotated osteosarcoma tumor samples and aimed to determine if PDL1 expression correlates with clinical features and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR for PDL1 was optimized in 18 cell lines, of which 5 were osteosarcoma derived. qRT-PCR results were validated via flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in select cell lines. Total RNA was isolated from 38 human osteosarcoma samples for qRT-PCR analysis. Clinical data were sorted, and significance was determined by the Student t test. TILs were examined in patient samples by tissue microarray hematoxylin-eosin staining. We confirmed the constitutive PDL1 mRNA expression in cell lines by qRT-PCR, flow cytometry, and IHC. Across human osteosarcoma samples, PDL1 mRNA gene expression ranged over 4 log (>5,000-fold difference). Relative expression levels were evaluated against clinical factors such as age/gender, metastasis, recurrence, chemotherapy, percentage of necrosis, and survival; no significant associations were identified. The presence of TILs was associated with high PDL1 expression (R(2) = 0.37; P = 0.01). In summary, we developed an RNA-based assay to determine PDL1 expression levels, and we show, for the first time, that high levels of PDL1 are expressed in a subset of osteosarcoma, and PDL1 expression is positively correlated with TILs.

Bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals as targeted agents of osteosarcoma: samarium-153-EDTMP and radium-223.,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,Adv. Exp. Med. Biol.,2014-01-01,"Osteosarcoma is a cancer characterized by formation of bone by malignant cells. Routine bone scan imaging with Tc-99m-MDP is done at diagnosis to evaluate primary tumor uptake and check for bone metastases. At time of relapse the Tc-99m-MDP bone scan also provides a specific means to assess formation of bone by malignant osteosarcoma cells and the potential for bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals to deliver radioactivity directly into osteoblastic osteosarcoma lesions. This chapter will review and compare a bone-seeking radiopharmaceutical that emits beta-particles, samarium-153-EDTMP, with an alpha-particle emitter, radium-223. The charged alpha particles from radium-223 have far more mass and energy than beta particles (electrons) from Sm-153-EDTMP. Because radium-223 has less marrow toxicity and more radiobiological effectiveness, especially if inside the bone forming cancer cell than samarium-153-EDTMP, radium-223 may have greater potential to become widely used against osteosarcoma as a targeted therapy. Radium-223 also has more potential to be used with chemotherapy against osteosarcoma and bone metastases.

Muramyl tripeptide-phosphatidyl ethanolamine encapsulated in liposomes (L-MTP-PE) in the treatment of osteosarcoma.,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,Adv. Exp. Med. Biol.,2014-01-01,"Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) has been used for decades as an immune stimulant to treat cancer. Early work by Fidler and Kleinerman identified muramyl dipeptide (MDP) as a critical component of the BCG cell wall which retained most of the immunostimulatory properties of the native BCG. Addition of a peptide to MDP resulted in muramyl tripeptide (MTP) which allowed incorporation into liposomal membranes. The resulting pharmaceutical, liposomal muramyl tripeptide phosphatidyl ethanolamine (L-MTP-PE or mifamurtide) showed activity in preclinical models of human cancers. Phase I studies documented the safety of the compound for human administration. These trials did not reach a maximally tolerated dose (MTD), and the dose chosen for phase II trials was a biologically optimized dose, not an MTD. Phase II studies showed decreased risk of further recurrence in patients who received mifamurtide after surgical ablation of metastatic osteosarcoma. A phase III prospective randomized trial demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the risk of death from osteosarcoma when MTP was added to systemic chemotherapy for the treatment of localized osteosarcoma. The same trial allowed treatment of patients who presented with initially metastatic disease. While the overall and event-free survival was improved in patients with metastatic osteosarcoma who received L-MTP-PE, the sample size was small and the improvement did not achieve conventional statistical significance. From 2008 to 2012, patients with metastatic and recurrent osteosarcoma were given L-MTP-PE in an expanded access trial, and the results suggest a decreased risk of subsequent recurrence and death with the inclusion of L-MTP-PE in the treatment strategy for these high-risk patients.

"Orthotopic murine model of a primary malignant bone tumor in the spine: functional, bioluminescence, and histological correlations.",Journal of neurosurgery. Spine,J Neurosurg Spine,2014-06-27,"There is currently no reproducible animal model of human primary malignant bone tumors in the spine to permit laboratory investigation of the human disease. Therefore, the authors sought to adapt their previously developed orthotopic model of spinal metastasis to a model for primary malignant bone tumors of the spine. A transperitoneal surgical approach was used to implant osteosarcoma (Krib-1) into the L-3 vertebral body of nude mice via a drill hole. Motor function was evaluated daily using the previously validated qualitative key milestones of tail dragging, dorsal stepping, hindlimb sweeping, and paralysis. A subset of these animals was euthanized upon reaching the various milestones, and the spines were removed, sectioned, and stained. The degree of spinal cord compression was correlated with the occurrence of milestones and assessed by a ratio between the neural elements divided by the area of the spinal canal. Another subset of animals received stably transfected Krib-1 cells with the luciferase gene, and bioluminescence was measured at 10, 20, and 30 days postimplantation. Osteosarcoma xenografts grew in all animals according to a reliable and reproducible time course; the mean time for development of behavioral milestones was noted in relation to the day of implantation (Day 1). Tail dragging (Milestone 1) occurred on Day 19.06 (95% CI 16.11-22.01), dorsal stepping (Milestone 2) occurred on Day 28.78 (95% CI 26.79-30.77), hindlimb sweeping (Milestone 3) occurred on Day 35.61 (95% CI 32.9-38.32), and paralysis of the hindlimb (Milestone 4) occurred on Day 41.78 (95% CI 39.31-44.25). These clinically observed milestones correlated with increasing compression of the spinal cord on histological sections. The authors observed a progressive increase in the local bioluminescence (in photons/cm²/sec) of the implanted level over time with a mean of 2.17 (range 0.0-8.61) at Day 10, mean 4.68 (range 1.17-8.52) at Day 20, and mean 5.54 (range 1.22-9.99) at Day 30. The authors have developed the first orthotopic murine model of a primary malignant bone tumor in the spine, in which neurological decline reproducibly correlates with tumor progression as evidenced by pathological confirmation and noninvasive bioluminescence measurements. Although developed for osteosarcoma, this model can be expanded to study other types of primary malignant bone tumors in the spine. This model will potentially allow animal testing of targeted therapies against specific primary malignant tumor types.",Journal Article,2034.0,1.0,There is currently no reproducible animal model of human primary malignant tumors in the spine to permit laboratory investigation of the human disease Therefore the authors sought to adapt their previously developed orthotopic model of spinal metastasis to a model for primary malignant tumors of the spine A transperitoneal surgical approach was used to implant Krib-1 into the L-3 vertebral body of nude mice via a drill hole Motor function was evaluated daily using the previously validated qualitative key milestones of tail dragging dorsal stepping hindlimb sweeping and paralysis A subset of these animals was euthanized upon reaching the various milestones and the spines were removed sectioned and stained The degree of spinal cord compression was correlated with the occurrence of milestones and assessed by a ratio between the neural elements divided by the area of the spinal canal Another subset of animals received stably transfected Krib-1 cells with the luciferase gene and bioluminescence was measured at 10 20 and 30 days postimplantation xenografts grew in all animals according to a reliable and reproducible time course the mean time for development of behavioral milestones was noted in relation to the day of implantation Day 1 Tail dragging Milestone 1 occurred on Day 19.06 95 CI 16.11-22.01 dorsal stepping Milestone 2 occurred on Day 28.78 95 CI 26.79-30.77 hindlimb sweeping Milestone 3 occurred on Day 35.61 95 CI 32.9-38.32 and paralysis of the hindlimb Milestone 4 occurred on Day 41.78 95 CI 39.31-44.25 These clinically observed milestones correlated with increasing compression of the spinal cord on histological sections The authors observed a progressive increase in the local bioluminescence in photons/cm²/sec of the implanted level over time with a mean of 2.17 range 0.0-8.61 at Day 10 mean 4.68 range 1.17-8.52 at Day 20 and mean 5.54 range 1.22-9.99 at Day 30 The authors have developed the first orthotopic murine model of a primary malignant tumor in the spine in which neurological decline reproducibly correlates with tumor progression as evidenced by pathological confirmation and noninvasive bioluminescence measurements Although developed for this model can be expanded to study other types of primary malignant tumors in the spine This model will potentially allow animal testing of targeted therapies against specific primary malignant tumor types,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[125, 16, 694, 77, 4172, 2026, 202, 1, 171, 86, 393, 57, 4, 3, 2342, 6, 5634, 1624, 940, 1, 3, 171, 34, 673, 3, 738, 990, 6, 11337, 136, 373, 276, 2157, 202, 1, 1499, 278, 6, 8, 202, 9, 86, 393, 57, 1, 3, 2342, 8, 12145, 221, 353, 10, 95, 6, 4194, 40763, 14, 237, 3, 805, 27, 4731, 642, 1, 2598, 399, 847, 8, 34711, 21564, 3482, 343, 10, 194, 391, 75, 3, 373, 938, 3926, 825, 12118, 1, 5809, 34712, 12891, 34713, 22279, 26845, 2, 11737, 8, 697, 1, 46, 2258, 10, 28038, 1548, 6168, 3, 747, 12118, 2, 3, 28372, 11, 2264, 18302, 2, 3386, 3, 1444, 1, 1499, 1885, 3481, 10, 438, 5, 3, 2291, 1, 12118, 2, 275, 20, 8, 197, 59, 3, 3922, 2531, 2176, 20, 3, 965, 1, 3, 1499, 5614, 1809, 697, 1, 2258, 103, 5834, 3245, 40763, 14, 37, 5, 3, 3864, 145, 2, 7956, 10, 644, 28, 79, 179, 2, 201, 162, 33516, 1348, 8033, 4, 62, 2258, 768, 6, 8, 2450, 2, 4172, 98, 906, 3, 313, 98, 9, 193, 1, 4166, 12118, 10, 1051, 4, 2191, 6, 3, 218, 1, 4314, 218, 14, 5809, 34712, 12821, 14, 489, 23, 218, 326, 1460, 48, 58, 245, 175, 350, 355, 12891, 34713, 12821, 18, 489, 23, 218, 339, 833, 48, 58, 432, 842, 201, 849, 22279, 26845, 12821, 27, 489, 23, 218, 465, 713, 48, 58, 531, 83, 519, 531, 2, 11737, 1, 3, 22279, 12821, 39, 489, 23, 218, 605, 833, 48, 58, 587, 456, 584, 243, 46, 505, 164, 12118, 438, 5, 602, 3481, 1, 3, 1499, 1885, 23, 1831, 3013, 3, 738, 164, 8, 1014, 344, 4, 3, 293, 7956, 4, 7862, 64554, 13678, 1, 3, 3416, 301, 252, 98, 5, 8, 313, 1, 18, 269, 184, 13, 13, 66, 713, 28, 218, 79, 313, 39, 806, 184, 14, 269, 66, 653, 28, 218, 179, 2, 313, 33, 667, 184, 14, 350, 83, 1058, 28, 218, 201, 3, 738, 47, 276, 3, 157, 2157, 1471, 202, 1, 8, 86, 393, 30, 4, 3, 2342, 4, 92, 3622, 1858, 10580, 1871, 5, 30, 91, 22, 4728, 20, 1301, 3551, 2, 2957, 7956, 1685, 242, 276, 9, 26, 202, 122, 40, 2064, 6, 45, 127, 630, 1, 86, 393, 57, 4, 3, 2342, 26, 202, 303, 751, 1700, 2026, 471, 1, 238, 235, 480, 112, 86, 393, 30, 630]",2397.0,24971476,133
Prognostic significance of treatment-induced pathologic necrosis in extremity and truncal soft tissue sarcoma after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.,Cancer,Cancer,2014-07-31,"Histologic response to chemotherapy has been shown to be an independent prognostic factor in patients with osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. However, in patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS), the prognostic impact of histologic response to chemotherapy is less clear. In the current study, the authors sought to determine the prognostic significance of treatment-induced pathologic necrosis in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for STS. Between 1989 and 2011, a total of 113 patients with grade 2 or 3 (graded according to the National Cancer Institute grading system using 3 tiers) extremity or truncal STS were identified who received neoadjuvant interdigitated chemoradiotherapy according to protocol followed by surgery. The extent of tumor necrosis in the resected specimens was quantified and correlated with outcome. The median tumor necrosis rate was 90%, and 103 patients (91%) received all 3 cycles of planned neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The likelihood of achieving ≥95% necrosis was not related to the number of preoperative cycles of chemotherapy received but was found to be related to tumor histology (62% for malignant fibrous histiocytoma vs 0% for synovial sarcoma [P<.001]; 56% for myxoid liposarcoma vs 0% for synovial sarcoma [P = .002]). At a median follow-up of 6 years, there were no statistically significant differences noted in the 5-year local control, disease-specific survival, and overall survival rates for patients with ≥95% necrosis (50 patients; 44%) and <95% necrosis (63 patients; 56%), even when stratifying by histology.

"Secondary malignant neoplasms among children, adolescents, and young adults with osteosarcoma.",Cancer,Cancer,2014-08-12,"As patients with osteosarcoma become long-term survivors, increasing attention has turned to the burden of late effects. The goal of the current study was to describe the incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMNs) in this population. Patients aged birth to 40 years at time of primary diagnosis with osteosarcoma and reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program between 1973 and 2010 were eligible for inclusion in the cohort. Competing risks methods were used to estimate the cumulative incidence of SMNs and potential risk factors for developing an SMN. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and overall survival after an SMN were estimated. The SEER database included 3379 patients who were diagnosed with osteosarcoma as their first malignancy. Of these, 89 patients were diagnosed with an SMN. The cumulative incidence of any SMN was 2.1% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.6%-2.7%) at 10 years, 4.0% (95% CI, 3.1%-5.1%) at 20 years, and 7.4% (95% CI, 5.6%-9.5%) at 30 years. The median time from the primary diagnosis to an SMN diagnosis was 6.0 years. The SIR for SMNs for survivors of osteosarcoma compared with the general population was 1.6 (95% CI, 1.0-2.5) for patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma from 1973 through 1985 and 4.7 (95% CI, 3.3-6.4) for patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma from 1986 through 2010, with a 34-fold increased risk of leukemia in this most recent era. The overall survival rate at 5 years for patients with SMNs after a diagnosis of osteosarcoma was 44.5%.

A-770041 reverses paclitaxel and doxorubicin resistance in osteosarcoma cells.,BMC cancer,BMC Cancer,2014-09-19,"Reversing multidrug resistance (MDR) has been an important goal for clinical and investigational oncologists. In the last few decades, significant effort has been made to search for inhibitors to reverse MDR by targeting ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters (Pgp, MRP) directly, but these efforts have achieved little clinical success. Protein kinases play important roles in many aspects of tumor cell growth and survival. Combinations of kinase inhibitors and chemotherapeutics have been observed to overcome cancer drug resistance in certain circumstances. We screened a kinase specific inhibitor compound library in human osteosarcoma MDR cell lines to identify inhibitors that were capable of reversing chemoresistance to doxorubicin and paclitaxel. We identified 18 small molecules that significantly increase chemotherapy drug-induced cell death in human osteosarcoma MDR cell lines U-2OSMR and KHOSR2. We identified A-770041 as one of the most effective MDR reversing agents when combined with doxorubicin or paclitaxel. A-770041 is a potent Src family kinase (Lck and Src) inhibitor. Western blot analysis revealed A-770041 inhibits both Src and Lck activation and expression. Inhibition of Src expression in U-2OSMR and KHOSR2 cell lines using lentiviral shRNA also resulted in increased doxorubicin and paclitaxel drug sensitivity.

Influence of bony resection margins and surgicopathological factors on outcomes in limb-sparing surgery for extremity osteosarcoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2014-11-08,"Limb-sparing surgery for osteosarcoma requires taking wide bony resection margins while maximizing preservation of native bone and joint. However, the optimal bony margin and factors associated with recurrence and survival outcomes in these patients are not well established. We conducted a retrospective review of outcomes in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed osteosarcoma from 1986 to 2012, where bony resection margins for limb-sparing surgeries were decreased serially from 5 to 1.5 cm. The association between bony margins and other surgicopathological factors with survival and recurrence outcomes was determined. In 181 limb-sparing surgeries in 173 patients, planned and actual bony resection margins were not significantly associated with local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS)-at median 5.8 years follow-up, decreasing planned bony resection margins from 5 to 1.5 cm did not significantly decrease survival outcomes. Multivariable analysis showed that the presence of distant metastases at diagnosis was associated with decreased LRFS, EFS, and OS (P = 0.002, 0.005, and <0.0001, respectively). Post-chemotherapy tumor necrosis ≤90% was associated with decreased EFS and OS (P = 0.001 and 0.022, respectively). Earlier years of treatment and pathologic fractures were associated with decreased OS only (P = 0.018 and 0.008, respectively); previous cancer history and male gender were associated with decreased EFS only (P = 0.043 and 0.023, respectively). We did not observe significant increase in adverse survival outcomes with reduction of longitudinal bony resection margins to 1.5 cm. Established prognostic factors, particularly histologic response to chemotherapy and metastases at diagnosis, remain relevant in limb-sparing patients.

We evaluated the activity of the anti-IGF-1R antibody cixutumumab with the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus in patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and other soft tissue sarcoma, using the recommended dosages from a pediatric phase I trial. Cixutumumab 6 mg/kg and temsirolimus 8 mg/m(2) were administered intravenously once weekly in 4-week cycles to patients <30 years. Temsirolimus was escalated to 10 mg/m(2) for subsequent cycles in patients who did not experience unacceptable first-cycle toxicity. A two-stage design was used to identify a response rate <10 or >35% for each tumor-specific cohort. Tumor tissue was analyzed by immunohistochemistry for potential biomarkers of response. Forty-three evaluable patients received a median of 2 cycles (range 1-7). No objective responses were observed, and 16% of patients were progression-free at 12 weeks. Dose-limiting toxicity was observed in 15 (16%) of 92 cycles. The most common toxicities were mucositis, electrolyte disturbances, and myelosuppression. The majority of patients receiving a second cycle were not eligible for temsirolimus escalation due to first-cycle toxicity.

Complementary genomic approaches highlight the PI3K/mTOR pathway as a common vulnerability in osteosarcoma.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2014-12-15,"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor, yet there have been no substantial advances in treatment or survival in three decades. We examined 59 tumor/normal pairs by whole-exome, whole-genome, and RNA-sequencing. Only the TP53 gene was mutated at significant frequency across all samples. The mean nonsilent somatic mutation rate was 1.2 mutations per megabase, and there was a median of 230 somatic rearrangements per tumor. Complex chains of rearrangements and localized hypermutation were detected in almost all cases. Given the intertumor heterogeneity, the extent of genomic instability, and the difficulty in acquiring a large sample size in a rare tumor, we used several methods to identify genomic events contributing to osteosarcoma survival.

Pediatric bone sarcoma: diagnostic performance of ¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT versus conventional imaging for initial staging and follow-up.,AJR. American journal of roentgenology,AJR Am J Roentgenol,2015-01-01,"The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic performance of (18)F-FDG PET/CT and conventional imaging for staging and follow-up of pediatric osteosarcoma and skeletal Ewing sarcoma. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of PET/CT and conventional imaging (CT, MRI, bone scanning) for sites of disease and number of lesions. Diagnostic benefit, defined as better characterization of lesions, was evaluated on a per-scan basis, comparing PET/CT and conventional imaging. A total of 412 lesions were characterized by imaging in 64 patients (20, osteosarcoma; 44, Ewing sarcoma). For osteosarcoma patients PET/CT was available only at follow-up, where it proved more accurate than conventional imaging for the detection of bone lesions (accuracy, 95% vs 67% for CT and 86% for MRI) and complementary to CT in evaluating lung nodules (sensitivity, 84% vs 94%; specificity, 79% vs 71%) with diagnostic benefit in 18% of examinations. In patients with Ewing sarcoma, PET/CT tended to perform better during follow-up than at initial staging (accuracy, 85% vs 69%). For lung findings, PET/CT was more specific than CT but was less sensitive. The diagnostic benefit of PET/CT was greater at staging (28%) than during followup (9%). On a per-patient basis, PET/CT provided diagnostic benefit in 21 of 44 patients with Ewing sarcoma and nine of 20 patients with osteosarcoma at least once during clinical management.

NSC23925 prevents the emergence of multidrug resistance in ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2015-02-10,"The development of multidrug resistance (MDR) remains the significant clinical challenge in ovarian cancer therapy; however, relatively little is known about how to prevent the emergence of MDR during chemotherapy treatment. NSC23925 previously has been shown to prevent the development of MDR in osteosarcoma cells in vitro. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of NSC23925 on the prevention of MDR in ovarian cancer, especially in vivo. Human ovarian cancer cells were treated with paclitaxel alone or in combination with NSC23925 in vitro and in vivo. MDR ovarian cancer cells were established both in cultured cells and mouse models. The expression levels of Pgp and MDR1 were evaluated in various selected cell sublines by Western blot and real-time PCR. Pgp activity was also determined. Paclitaxel treated cells eventually developed MDR with overexpression of Pgp and MDR1, and with high activity of Pgp, while paclitaxel-NSC23925 co-treated cells remained sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents in both in vitro and in vivo models. There was no observed increase in expression level and activity of Pgp in paclitaxel-NSC23925 co-treated cells.

Targeting IL11 Receptor in Leukemia and Lymphoma: A Functional Ligand-Directed Study and Hematopathology Analysis of Patient-Derived Specimens.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2015-03-16,"The IL11 receptor (IL11R) is an established molecular target in primary tumors of bone, such as osteosarcoma, and in secondary bone metastases from solid tumors, such as prostate cancer. However, its potential role in management of hematopoietic malignancies has not yet been determined. Here, we evaluated the IL11R as a candidate therapeutic target in human leukemia and lymphoma. First, we show that the IL11R protein is expressed in a variety of human leukemia- and lymphoma-derived cell lines and in a large panel of bone marrow samples from leukemia and lymphoma patients, whereas expression is absent from nonmalignant control bone marrow. Moreover, a targeted peptidomimetic prototype (termed BMTP-11), specifically bound to leukemia and lymphoma cell membranes, induced ligand-receptor internalization mediated by the IL11R, and resulted in a specific dose-dependent cell death induction in these cells. Finally, a pilot drug lead-optimization program yielded a new myristoylated BMTP-11 analogue with an apparent improved antileukemia cell profile. These results indicate (i) that the IL11R is a suitable cell surface target for ligand-directed applications in human leukemia and lymphoma and (ii) that BMTP-11 and its derivatives have translational potential against this group of malignant diseases.",Journal Article,1772.0,6.0,The IL11 receptor IL11R is an established molecular target in primary tumors of such as and in secondary metastases from solid tumors such as cancer However its potential role in management of hematopoietic malignancies has not yet been determined Here we evaluated the IL11R as a candidate therapeutic target in human and First we show that the IL11R protein is expressed in a variety of human leukemia- and lymphoma-derived cell lines and in a large panel of marrow samples from and patients whereas expression is absent from nonmalignant control marrow Moreover a targeted peptidomimetic prototype termed BMTP-11 specifically bound to and cell membranes induced ligand-receptor internalization mediated by the IL11R and resulted in a specific dose-dependent cell death induction in these cells Finally a pilot drug lead-optimization program yielded a new myristoylated BMTP-11 analogue with an apparent improved antileukemia cell profile These results indicate i that the IL11R is a suitable cell surface target for ligand-directed applications in human and and ii that BMTP-11 and its derivatives have translational potential against this group of malignant diseases,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 65771, 153, 32409, 16, 35, 635, 219, 283, 4, 86, 57, 1, 225, 22, 2, 4, 568, 196, 29, 537, 57, 225, 22, 12, 137, 211, 174, 200, 4, 284, 1, 1007, 441, 71, 44, 1145, 85, 509, 467, 21, 194, 3, 32409, 22, 8, 1609, 189, 283, 4, 171, 2, 157, 21, 514, 17, 3, 32409, 178, 16, 570, 4, 8, 1362, 1, 171, 2647, 2, 4763, 526, 31, 285, 2, 4, 8, 375, 993, 1, 581, 347, 29, 2, 7, 547, 55, 16, 3269, 29, 5967, 182, 581, 1393, 8, 238, 21125, 8743, 4183, 19375, 175, 1225, 2951, 6, 2, 31, 10255, 277, 1232, 153, 7520, 517, 20, 3, 32409, 2, 627, 4, 8, 112, 61, 470, 31, 273, 504, 4, 46, 37, 1368, 8, 2281, 234, 1122, 3980, 1243, 2178, 8, 217, 22206, 19375, 175, 4696, 5, 35, 2235, 231, 9169, 31, 800, 46, 99, 1008, 70, 17, 3, 32409, 16, 8, 2884, 31, 1255, 283, 9, 1232, 1166, 2911, 4, 171, 2, 2, 215, 17, 19375, 175, 2, 211, 6490, 47, 2460, 174, 480, 26, 87, 1, 393, 1342]",1170.0,25779950,1
Intermittent induction of HIF-1α produces lasting effects on malignant progression independent of its continued expression.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2015-04-20,"Dysregulation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α correlates with poor prognosis in human cancers; yet, divergent and sometimes opposing activities of these factors in cancer biology have been observed. Adding to this complexity is that HIF-1α apparently possesses tumor-suppressing activities, as indicated by the loss-of-function mutations or even homozygous deletion of HIF1A in certain human cancers. As a step towards understanding this complexity, we employed 8-week intermittent induction of a stable HIF-1α variant, HIF1α(PP), in various cancer cell lines and examined the effects on malignant progression in xenografts of immunocompromised mice in comparison to those of HIF2α(PP). Although 8-week treatment led to eventual loss of HIF1α(PP) expression, treated osteosarcoma U-2 OS cells acquired tumorigenicity in the subcutaneous tissue. Furthermore, the prior treatment resulted in widespread invasion of malignant glioma U-87 MG cells in the mouse brain and sustained growth of U-118 MG glioma cells. The lasting effects of HIF-1α on malignant progression are specific because neither HIF2α(PP) nor β-galactosidase yielded similar effects. By contrast, transient expression of HIF1α(PP) in U-87 MG cells or constitutive expression of HIF1α(PP) but not HIF2α(PP) in a patient-derived glioma sphere culture inhibited tumor growth and spread. Our results indicate that intermittent induction of HIF-1α produces lasting effects on malignant progression even at its own expense.

Activation of the IR by IGF-2 results in increased survival of tumor cells. We have previously identified a novel human monoclonal antibody, m708.5, which binds with high (pM) affinity to both human IGF-1 and IGF-2, and potently inhibits phosphorylation of the IGF-1R and the IR in tumor cells. m708.5 exhibited strong antitumor activity as a single agent against most cell lines derived from neuroblastoma, Ewing family of tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma and osteosarcoma.

Initially, we found a marked difference in postoperative continuous disease-free survival (CDFS) between those with 90% or greater (i.e., good response) tumor necrosis and those with less than 90% (i.e., poor response) tumor necrosis. The sequential addition of high-dose methotrexate and ifosfamide to patients with poorly responding disease improved their CDFS to that of patients with good response. Older patients and those who have tumors with variant histology have inferior outcomes. Evaluation of subsequent patients revealed similar outcomes for those with good or poor response to induction therapy, supporting our practice of adaptation of postoperative chemotherapy to the results of preoperative chemotherapy. PET-CT is the best imaging modality to screen for a response with tumors inside bone. To treat Ewing sarcoma, we have employed 2 mg of vincristine, 75 to 90 mg/m2 of doxorubicin as a 72-hour infusion, and 2.5 g/m2 of ifosfamide over 3 hours daily for 4 doses (i.e., vincristine, doxorubicin, and ifosfamide [VAI]). Preliminary analysis indicates a higher CDFS when adjusted for patient age than seen with the standard alternating regimen used in pediatrics. A screening MRI of the pelvis and spine can detect subtle metastatic disease in bone or bone marrow that is missed by other imaging modalities or blind biopsy. Chondrosarcoma is treated surgically or on investigational protocols. Giant cell tumor of bone is usually managed surgically, but multiple options exist for medical treatment, and therapy is individualized with embolization, denosumab, and interferon.",Journal Article,1846.0,6.0,Increasing age is an adverse prognostic factor in the treatment of primary tumors There are few published data on treatment of primary tumors in adults This paper presents data from the Department of Medical Oncology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center summarizing our treatment results To treat primary we used 90 mg/m2 of doxorubicin as a continuous intravenous infusion over 48 to 96 hours and 120 to 160 mg/m2 of cisplatin intravenously or intra-arterially Initially we found a marked difference in postoperative continuous disease-free survival CDFS between those with 90 or greater i.e. good response tumor necrosis and those with less than 90 i.e. poor response tumor necrosis The sequential addition of high-dose methotrexate and ifosfamide to patients with poorly responding disease improved their CDFS to that of patients with good response Older patients and those who have tumors with variant histology have inferior outcomes Evaluation of subsequent patients revealed similar outcomes for those with good or poor response to induction therapy supporting our practice of adaptation of postoperative chemotherapy to the results of preoperative chemotherapy PET-CT is the best imaging modality to screen for a response with tumors inside To treat we have employed 2 mg of vincristine 75 to 90 mg/m2 of doxorubicin as a 72-hour infusion and 2.5 g/m2 of ifosfamide over 3 hours daily for 4 doses i.e. vincristine doxorubicin and ifosfamide VAI Preliminary analysis indicates a higher CDFS when adjusted for patient age than seen with the standard alternating regimen used in pediatrics A screening MRI of the pelvis and spine can detect subtle metastatic disease in or marrow that is missed by other imaging modalities or blind biopsy Chondrosarcoma is treated surgically or on investigational protocols Giant cell tumor of is usually managed surgically but multiple options exist for medical treatment and therapy is individualized with embolization denosumab and interferon,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[602, 89, 16, 35, 290, 177, 161, 4, 3, 24, 1, 86, 57, 125, 32, 1021, 983, 74, 23, 24, 1, 86, 57, 4, 857, 26, 2817, 2740, 74, 29, 3, 4271, 1, 484, 413, 28, 3, 1652, 1, 2738, 2244, 1929, 12, 574, 15693, 114, 24, 99, 6, 943, 86, 21, 95, 424, 81, 821, 1, 856, 22, 8, 1314, 1262, 904, 252, 576, 6, 921, 1459, 2, 2031, 6, 3457, 81, 821, 1, 540, 1672, 15, 2392, 33983, 1625, 21, 204, 8, 2003, 523, 4, 573, 1314, 34, 115, 25, 14710, 59, 135, 5, 424, 15, 378, 70, 563, 1178, 51, 30, 1523, 2, 135, 5, 299, 76, 424, 70, 563, 334, 51, 30, 1523, 3, 1787, 352, 1, 64, 61, 2116, 2, 3157, 6, 7, 5, 1240, 3261, 34, 231, 136, 14710, 6, 17, 1, 7, 5, 1178, 51, 434, 7, 2, 135, 54, 47, 57, 5, 1142, 784, 47, 1663, 123, 451, 1, 706, 7, 553, 288, 123, 9, 135, 5, 1178, 15, 334, 51, 6, 504, 36, 1912, 114, 758, 1, 7275, 1, 573, 56, 6, 3, 99, 1, 498, 56, 495, 425, 16, 3, 824, 270, 1396, 6, 2413, 9, 8, 51, 5, 57, 8133, 6, 943, 21, 47, 2516, 18, 81, 1, 2132, 481, 6, 424, 81, 821, 1, 856, 22, 8, 720, 2583, 904, 2, 18, 33, 499, 821, 1, 3157, 252, 27, 1459, 391, 9, 39, 415, 70, 563, 2132, 856, 2, 3157, 32167, 1676, 65, 2640, 8, 142, 14710, 198, 586, 9, 69, 89, 76, 527, 5, 3, 260, 5181, 477, 95, 4, 12616, 8, 453, 704, 1, 3, 3270, 2, 2342, 122, 1426, 7543, 113, 34, 4, 15, 581, 17, 16, 5149, 20, 127, 270, 1558, 15, 3142, 411, 6116, 16, 73, 2350, 15, 23, 3093, 2189, 6470, 31, 30, 1, 16, 2082, 2231, 2350, 84, 232, 838, 1923, 9, 484, 24, 2, 36, 16, 2596, 5, 4232, 5605, 2, 1688]",2000.0,25993237,155
CD44 is a direct target of miR-199a-3p and contributes to aggressive progression in osteosarcoma.,Scientific reports,Sci Rep,2015-06-16,"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone malignancy in children and adolescents. Herein, we investigated the role of cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44), a cell-surface glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion, and migration in osteosarcoma. We constructed a human osteosarcoma tissue microarray with 114 patient tumor specimens, including tumor tissues from primary, metastatic, and recurrent stages, and determined the expression of CD44 by immunohistochemistry. Results showed that CD44 was overexpressed in metastatic and recurrent osteosarcoma as compared with primary tumors. Higher expression of CD44 was found in both patients with shorter survival and patients who exhibited unfavorable response to chemotherapy before surgical resection. Additionally, the 3'-untranslated region of CD44 mRNA was the direct target of microRNA-199a-3p (miR-199a-3p). Overexpression of miR-199a-3p significantly inhibited CD44 expression in osteosarcoma cells. miR-199a-3p is one of the most dramatically decreased miRs in osteosarcoma cells and tumor tissues as compared with normal osteoblast cells. Transfection of miR-199a-3p significantly increased the drug sensitivity through down-regulation of CD44 in osteosarcoma cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the CD44-miR-199a-3p axis plays an important role in the development of metastasis, recurrence, and drug resistance of osteosarcoma. Developing strategies to target CD44 may improve the clinical outcome of osteosarcoma.

CD47 blockade inhibits tumor progression human osteosarcoma in xenograft models.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2015-09-01,"Osteosarcoma is the most common bone tumors in children and adolescents. Despite intensive chemotherapy, patients with advanced disease still have a poor prognosis, illustrating the need for alternative therapies. In this study, we explored the use of antibodies that block CD47 with a tumor growth suppressive effect on osteosarcoma. We first found that up-regulation of CD47 mRNA levels in the tumorous tissues from eight patients with osteosarcoma when compared with that in adjacent non-tumorous tissues. Further western-blot (WB) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) demonstrated that CD47 protein level was highly expressed in osteosarcoma compared to normal osteoblastic cells and adjacent non-tumorous tissues. Osteosarcoma cancer stem cell markers staining shown that the majority of CD44+ cells expressed CD47 albeit with different percentages (ranging from 80% to 99%). Furthermore, high CD47 mRNA expression levels were associated with a decreased probability of progression-free and overall survival. In addition, blockade of CD47 by specific Abs suppresses the invasive ability of osteosarcoma tumor cells and further inhibits spontaneous pulmonary metastasis of KRIB osteosarcoma cells in vivo. Finally, CD47 blockade increases macrophage phagocytosis of osteosarcoma tumor cells.In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that CD47 is a critical regulator in the metastasis of osteosarcoma and suggest that targeted inhibition of this antigen by anti-CD47 may be a novel immunotherapeutic approach in the management of this tumor.

Patients aged 2.5-15 years with relapsed neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma were eligible to receive DAC followed by DC pulsed with overlapping peptides derived from full-length MAGE-A1, MAGE-A3 and NY-ESO-1. The primary endpoints were to assess the feasibility and tolerability of this regimen. Each of four cycles consisted of week 1: DAC 10 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days and weeks 2 and 3: DC vaccine once weekly. Fifteen patients were enrolled in the study, of which 10 were evaluable. Generation of DC was highly feasible for all enrolled patients. The treatment regimen was generally well tolerated, with the major toxicity being DAC-related myelosuppression in 5/10 patients. Six of nine patients developed a response to MAGE-A1, MAGE-A3 or NY-ESO-1 peptides post-vaccine.

Here, we report that IGF1R (15/15) and ROR1 (11/15) were highly expressed in sarcoma cell lines including Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, alveolar or embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, and fibrosarcoma. IGF1R and ROR1 CAR T cells derived from eight healthy donors using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system were cytotoxic against sarcoma cells and produced high levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-13 in an antigen-specific manner. IGF1R and ROR1 CAR T cells generated from three sarcoma patients released significant amounts of IFN-γ in response to sarcoma stimulation. The adoptive transfer of IGF1R and ROR1 CAR T cells derived from a sarcoma patient significantly reduced tumor growth in pre-established, systemically disseminated and localized osteosarcoma xenograft models in NSG mice. Infusion of IGF1R and ROR1 CAR T cells also prolonged animal survival in a localized sarcoma model using NOD/scid mice. Our data indicate that both IGF1R and ROR1 can be effectively targeted by SB modified CAR T cells and that such CAR T cells may be useful in the treatment of high risk sarcoma patients.

Should High-grade Extraosseous Osteosarcoma Be Treated With Multimodality Therapy Like Other Soft Tissue Sarcomas?,Clinical orthopaedics and related research,Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res.,2015-07-22,"Extraosseous osteosarcoma is rare, and the most appropriate therapy is unclear because there are few studies regarding its treatment. The effectiveness of radiation and chemotherapy remains uncertain owing to conflicting results in previous reports. To review our experience with contemporary multimodality treatment, we asked: (1) What is the disease-specific survival and local relapse-free survival? (2) Does American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) stage, tumor size, or location relate to disease outcome? (3) Does radiation therapy improve local control or survival? (4) Do doxorubicin and ifosfamide improve local control or survival? Between 1990 and 2012, we treated 40 patients for localized, high-grade extraosseous osteosarcoma. In this retrospective study, we could determine the status of 36 patients (90%) either to death or for a minimum of 24 months of followup; four (10%) were lost to followup before 24 months. There were 11 patients with AJCC Stage IIA and 25 with Stage III disease. All patients underwent wide surgical excision. Of the patients with Stage IIA disease, four received radiation and none received chemotherapy. Of the patients with Stage III disease, six received radiation, seven were treated with chemotherapy, and six received radiation and chemotherapy. During the study period, high-dose doxorubicin and ifosfamide was the preferred chemotherapy regimen for patients younger than 60 years with normal cardiac and renal function. Local relapse-free survival and disease-specific survival were determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis using a prospectively maintained institutional database supplemented by information from the institutional tumor registry. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine the effect of various factors on local recurrence and patient survival. At 5 years, local relapse-free survival was 47% (95% CI, 27%-64%), and disease-specific survival was 53% (95% CI, 35%-68%). In multivariate analysis, AJCC stage, which depends on tumor size, was the strongest predictor of local relapse-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.17, p = 0.02), while tumor depth was the best predictor of disease-specific survival (HR = 5.6, p = 0.02). Radiation improved local relapse-free survival (HR = 0.30, p = 0.03) but not disease-specific survival in multivariate analysis. A regimen of doxorubicin and ifosfamide was associated with better local relapse-free survival for patients with Stage III disease (HR = 0.16, p = 0.04) but not disease-specific survival (HR = 0.32, p = 0.08). With the limited number of patients in our study, it appears that extraosseous osteosarcoma behaves differently than osteosarcoma of bone. Multimodality treatment that includes doxorubicin and ifosfamide-based chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery may be a valid therapeutic strategy for Stage III disease, but larger, prospective studies will be needed to verify our preliminary observations.

TRIM66 overexpresssion contributes to osteosarcoma carcinogenesis and indicates poor survival outcome.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2015-09-01,"TRIM66 belongs to the family of tripartite motif (TRIM)-containing proteins. Alterations in TRIM proteins have been implicated in several malignancies. This study was aimed at elucidating the expression and biological function of TRIM66 in osteosarcoma. Here, TRIM66 expression level was higher in osteosarcoma tissues than in normal tissues. High TRIM66 expression was correlated with high rate of local recurrence and lung metastasis, and short survival time. Then, we found that knockdown of TRIM66 in two osteosarcoma cell lines, MG63 and HOS, significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced G1-phase arrest. Moreover, inhibition of TRIM66 in osteosarcoma cells significantly induced cell apoptosis, while remarkably inhibited cell migration, invasion as well as tumorigenicity in nude mice. Gene set enrichment analysis in Gene Expression Omnibus dataset revealed that apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway-related genes were enriched in TRIM66 higher expression patients, which was confirmed by western blot analysis in osteosarcoma cells with TRIM66 silenced. In conclusion, TRIM66 may act as an oncogene through suppressing apoptosis pathway and promoting TGF-β signaling in osteosarcoma carcinogenesis.

p53 modulates the activity of the GLI1 oncogene through interactions with the shared coactivator TAF9.,DNA repair,DNA Repair (Amst.),2015-08-01,"The GLI1 oncogene and p53 tumor suppressor gene function in an inhibitory loop that controls stem cell and tumor cell numbers. Since GLI1 and p53 both interact with the coactivator TATA Binding Protein Associated Factor 9 (TAF9), we hypothesized that competition between these transcription factors for TAF9 in cancer cells may contribute to the inhibitory loop and directly affect GLI1 function and cellular phenotype. We showed that TAF9 interacts with the oncogenic GLI family members GLI1 and GLI2 but not GLI3 in cell-free pull-down assays and with GLI1 in rhabdomyosarcoma and osteosarcoma cell lines. Removal of the TAF9-binding acidic alpha helical transactivation domain of GLI1 produced a significant reduction in the ability of GLI1 to transform cells. We then introduced a point mutation into GLI1 (L1052I) that eliminates TAF9 binding and a point mutation into GLI3 (I1510L) that establishes binding. Wild-type and mutant GLI proteins that bind TAF9 showed enhanced transactivating and cell transforming activity compared with those that did not. Therefore, GLI-TAF9 binding appears important for oncogenic activity. We then determined whether wild-type p53 down-regulates GLI function by sequestering TAF9.

Intensified Chemotherapy With Dexrazoxane Cardioprotection in Newly Diagnosed Nonmetastatic Osteosarcoma: A Report From the Children's Oncology Group.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2015-09-23,"Although chemotherapy has improved outcome of osteosarcoma, 30-40% of patients succumb to this disease. Survivors experience substantial morbidity and mortality from anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. We hypothesized that the cardioprotectant dexrazoxane would (i) support escalation of the cumulative doxorubicin dose (600 mg/m(2)) and (ii) not interfere with the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy measured by necrosis grading in comparison to historical control data. Children and adolescents with nonmetastatic osteosarcoma were treated with MAP (methotrexate, doxorubicin, cisplatin) or MAPI (MAP/ifosfamide). Dexrazoxane was administered with all doxorubicin doses. Cardioprotection was assessed by measuring left ventricular fractional shortening. Interference with chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity was determined by measuring tumor necrosis after induction chemotherapy. Feasibility of intensifying therapy with either high cumulative-dose doxorubicin or high-dose ifosfamide/etoposide was evaluated for ""standard responders"" (SR, <98% tumor necrosis at definitive surgery). Dexrazoxane did not compromise response to induction chemotherapy. With doxorubicin (450-600 mg/m(2)) and dexrazoxane, grade 1 or 2 left ventricular dysfunction occurred in five patients; 4/5 had transient effects. Left ventricular fractional shortening z-scores (FSZ) showed minimal reductions (0.0170  ±  0.009/week) over 78 weeks. Two patients (<1%) had secondary leukemia, one as a first event, a similar rate to what has been observed in prior trials. Intensification with high-dose ifosfamide/etoposide was also feasible. Dexrazoxane cardioprotection was safely administered. It did not impair tumor response or increase the risk of secondary malignancy. Dexrazoxane allowed for therapeutic intensification increasing the cumulative doxorubicin dose in SR to induction chemotherapy.

Denosumab-treated Giant Cell Tumor of Bone Exhibits Morphologic Overlap With Malignant Giant Cell Tumor of Bone.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2016-01-01,"Giant cell tumor (GCT) of bone is a locally aggressive benign neoplasm characterized by an abundance of osteoclastic giant cells that are induced by the neoplastic mononuclear cells; the latter express high levels of receptor activator of nuclear factor κ-B ligand (RANKL). Denosumab, a RANKL inhibitor, which is clinically used to treat GCT, leads to a marked alteration in the histologic appearance of the tumor with giant cell depletion and new bone deposition, leading to substantial histologic overlap with other primary tumors of bone. Most significantly, denosumab-treated GCT (tGCT) with abundant bone deposition may mimic de novo osteosarcoma, or GCT that has undergone malignant transformation. To histologically characterize tGCT, we identified 9 cases of GCT biopsied or resected after denosumab treatment. tGCT cases included 16 specimens from 9 patients including 6 female and 3 male individuals aged 16 to 47 (median 32) years. Duration of treatment varied from 2 to 55 months. We compared these tumors with malignant neoplasms arising in GCTs (n=9). The histology of tGCT was variable but appeared to relate to the length of therapy. All tGCTs showed marked giant cell depletion. Early lesions were highly cellular, and the combination of cellularity, atypia, and haphazard bone deposition caused the lesion to resemble high-grade osteosarcoma. Unlike de novo high-grade osteosarcoma or malignancies arising in GCT, however, tGCT showed less severe atypia, reduced mitotic activity, and lack of infiltrative growth pattern. Tumor in patients on prolonged therapy showed decreased cellularity and abundant new bone, deposited as broad, rounded cords or long, curvilinear arrays. The latter morphology was reminiscent of low-grade central osteosarcoma, but, unlike low-grade central osteosarcoma, tGCT was negative for MDM2 and again lacked an infiltrative growth pattern. Overall, tGCT may have a wide range of morphologic appearances. Because the treated tumors bear little resemblance to their pretreatment counterparts, careful attention to the history of denosumab administration is crucial to avoid a misdiagnosis with an important impact on therapy. Unlike malignant GCTs, tGCTs lack significant nuclear atypia, mitotic activity, and infiltration of preexisting bone, but instead show a unique pattern of intralesional bone deposition.

Radiation-induced Sarcomas Occurring in Desmoid-type Fibromatosis Are Not Always Derived From the Primary Tumor.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2015-12-01,"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a rare, highly infiltrative, locally destructive neoplasm that does not metastasize, but recurs often after primary surgery. Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is the pathogenic mechanism, caused by an activating mutation in exon 3 of CTNNB1 (85% of the sporadic patients). Radiotherapy is a frequent treatment modality with a local control rate of approximately 80%. In very rare cases, this may result in the development of radiation-induced sarcoma. It is unclear whether these sarcomas develop from the primary tumor or arise de novo in normal tissue. In 4 tertiary referral centers for sarcoma, 6 cases of desmoid-type fibromatosis that subsequently developed sarcoma after radiotherapy were collected. The DNA sequence of CTNNB1 exon 3 in the desmoid-type fibromatosis and the subsequent postradiation sarcoma was determined. Sarcomas developed 5 to 21 years after the diagnosis of desmoid-type fibromatosis and included 2 osteosarcomas, 2 high-grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas, 1 fibrosarcoma, and 1 undifferentiated spindle cell sarcoma. Three patients showed a CTNNB1 hotspot mutation (T41A, S45F, or S45N) in both the desmoid-type fibromatosis and the radiation-induced sarcoma. The other 3 patients showed a CTNNB1 mutation in the original desmoid-type fibromatosis (2 with a T41A and 1 with an S45F mutation), which was absent in the sarcoma. In conclusion, postradiation sarcomas that occur in the treatment area of desmoid-type fibromatosis are extremely rare and can arise through malignant transformation of CTNNB1-mutated desmoid fibromatosis cells, but may also originate from CTNNB1 wild-type normal cells lying in the radiation field.

Transcriptional Profiling Identifies the Signaling Axes of IGF and Transforming Growth Factor-b as Involved in the Pathogenesis of Osteosarcoma.,Clinical orthopaedics and related research,Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res.,2016-01-01,"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor in adolescents associated with skeletal development. The molecular pathogenesis of osteosarcoma has not been completely determined, although many molecular alterations have been found in human osteosarcomas and cell lines. We questioned whether (1) we could identify gene expression in osteosarcoma specimens that differs from normal osteoblasts and mesenchymal stem cells and (2) this would provide clues to the molecular pathogenesis of osteosarcoma? The whole-genome transcriptional profiles of osteosarcomas, including two primary biopsy specimens, two cell lines, two xenografts derived from patient specimens, and one from normal osteoblasts and from mesenchymal stem cells, respectively, were quantitatively measured using serial analysis of gene expression. A statistical enrichment was performed, which selects the common genes altered in each of the osteosarcomas compared with each of the normal counterparts independently. Sixty (92%) of 65 total genes that were at least twofold downregulated in osteosarcoma compared with osteoblasts and mesenchymal stem cells, could be classified in four categories: (1) seven genes in the insulin–like growth factor (IGF) signaling axis, including three of the IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP) and three of the IGFBPrelated proteins (IGFBPrP); (2) eight genes in the transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b)/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling cascade; (3) 39 genes encoding cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix proteins that are regulated by TGF-b/BMPs; and (4) six genes involved in cell cycle regulation, including tumor suppressors TP63 and p21. Based on these transcriptional profiles, a coordinated theme of clustered gene deregulation in osteosarcoma has emerged. Cell proliferation driven by the IGF axes during bone growth is unrestrained owing to downregulation of IGFBPs and cell cycle regulators. Tumor cells may be maintained in an undifferentiated state secondary to impaired TGF-b/BMP signaling. This wellpreserved pattern suggests that the alterations in the signaling axes of IGF-1 and TGF-b, in concert with cell cycle regulators, may be an important pathogenic basis of osteosarcoma. CLINIC RELEVANCE: This study provides a possible molecular basis of pathogenesis of osteosarcoma. This may help to develop new therapeutic targets and strategy for this disease.

Analysis of Heritability and Shared Heritability Based on Genome-Wide Association Studies for Thirteen Cancer Types.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2015-10-12,"Studies of related individuals have consistently demonstrated notable familial aggregation of cancer. We aim to estimate the heritability and genetic correlation attributable to the additive effects of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for cancer at 13 anatomical sites. Between 2007 and 2014, the US National Cancer Institute has generated data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for 49 492 cancer case patients and 34 131 control patients. We apply novel mixed model methodology (GCTA) to this GWAS data to estimate the heritability of individual cancers, as well as the proportion of heritability attributable to cigarette smoking in smoking-related cancers, and the genetic correlation between pairs of cancers. GWAS heritability was statistically significant at nearly all sites, with the estimates of array-based heritability, hl (2), on the liability threshold (LT) scale ranging from 0.05 to 0.38. Estimating the combined heritability of multiple smoking characteristics, we calculate that at least 24% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 14% to 37%) and 7% (95% CI = 4% to 11%) of the heritability for lung and bladder cancer, respectively, can be attributed to genetic determinants of smoking. Most pairs of cancers studied did not show evidence of strong genetic correlation. We found only four pairs of cancers with marginally statistically significant correlations, specifically kidney and testes (ρ = 0.73, SE = 0.28), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and pediatric osteosarcoma (ρ = 0.53, SE = 0.21), DLBCL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (ρ = 0.51, SE =0.18), and bladder and lung (ρ = 0.35, SE = 0.14). Correlation analysis also indicates that the genetic architecture of lung cancer differs between a smoking population of European ancestry and a nonsmoking Asian population, allowing for the possibility that the genetic etiology for the same disease can vary by population and environmental exposures.

Personalized comprehensive molecular profiling of high risk osteosarcoma: Implications and limitations for precision medicine.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2015-12-01,"Despite advances in molecular medicine over recent decades, there has been little advancement in the treatment of osteosarcoma. We performed comprehensive molecular profiling in two cases of metastatic and chemotherapy-refractory osteosarcoma to guide molecularly targeted therapy. Hybridization capture of >300 cancer-related genes plus introns from 28 genes often rearranged or altered in cancer was applied to >50 ng of DNA extracted from tumor samples from two patients with recurrent, metastatic osteosarcoma. The DNA from each sample was sequenced to high, uniform coverage. Immunohistochemical probes and morphoproteomics analysis were performed, in addition to fluorescence in situ hybridization. All analyses were performed in CLIA-certified laboratories. Molecularly targeted therapy based on the resulting profiles was offered to the patients. Biomedical analytics were performed using QIAGEN's Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis. In Patient #1, comprehensive next-generation exome sequencing showed MET amplification, PIK3CA mutation, CCNE1 amplification, and PTPRD mutation. Immunohistochemistry-based morphoproteomic analysis revealed c-Met expression [(p)-c-Met (Tyr1234/1235)] and activation of mTOR/AKT pathway [IGF-1R (Tyr1165/1166), p-mTOR [Ser2448], p-Akt (Ser473)] and expression of SPARC and COX2. Targeted therapy was administered to match the P1K3CA, c-MET, and SPARC and COX2 aberrations with sirolimus+ crizotinib and abraxane+ celecoxib. In Patient #2, aberrations included NF2 loss in exons 2-16, PDGFRα amplification, and TP53 mutation. This patient was enrolled on a clinical trial combining targeted agents temsirolimus, sorafenib and bevacizumab, to match NF2, PDGFRα and TP53 aberrations. Both the patients did not benefit from matched therapy. Relapsed osteosarcoma is characterized by complex signaling and drug resistance pathways. Comprehensive molecular profiling holds great promise for tailoring personalized therapies for cancer. Methods for such profiling are evolving and need to be refined to better assist clinicians in making treatment decisions based on the large amount of data that results from this type of testing.

Phase I Clinical Trial of Ipilimumab in Pediatric Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2015-11-03,"Ipilimumab is a first-in-class immune checkpoint inhibitor approved for treatment of metastatic melanoma but not studied in children until this phase I protocol. This study examined safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity, and immune correlates of ipilimumab administered to subjects ≤21 years old with recurrent or progressive solid tumors. Dose escalation cohorts received 1, 3, 5, or 10 mg/m(2) intravenously every 3 weeks in a 3 + 3 design. Response was assessed after 6 weeks and 12 weeks, and then every 3 months. Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Thirty-three patients received 72 doses of ipilimumab. Patients enrolled had melanoma (n = 12), sarcoma (n = 17), or other refractory solid tumors (n = 4). Immune-related adverse events included pancreatitis, pneumonitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, and transaminitis with dose-limiting toxicities observed at 5 and 10 mg/kg dose levels. Pharmacokinetics revealed a half-life of 8 to 15 days. At day 21, subjects had increased levels of cycling T cells, but no change in regulatory T-cell populations. Six subjects had confirmed stable disease for 4 to 10 cycles (melanoma, osteosarcoma, clear cell sarcoma, and synovial sarcoma). Ipilimumab was safely administered to pediatric patients using management algorithms for immune-related toxicities. The spectrum of immune-related adverse events is similar to those described in adults; however, many of the pediatric toxicities were evident after a single dose. Although no objective tumor regressions were observed with ipilimumab as a single agent, subjects with immune-related toxicities had an increased overall survival compared with those who showed no evidence of breaking tolerance.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",1540.0,83.0,Ipilimumab is a first-in-class immune checkpoint inhibitor approved for treatment of metastatic but not studied in children until this phase I protocol This study examined safety pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity and immune correlates of ipilimumab administered to subjects ≤21 years old with recurrent or progressive solid tumors Dose escalation cohorts received 1 3 5 or 10 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks in a 3 3 design Response was assessed after 6 weeks and 12 weeks and then every 3 months Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity Thirty-three patients received 72 doses of ipilimumab Patients enrolled had n 12 n 17 or other refractory solid tumors n 4 Immune-related adverse events included pancreatitis pneumonitis colitis endocrinopathies and transaminitis with dose-limiting toxicities observed at 5 and 10 mg/kg dose levels Pharmacokinetics revealed a half-life of 8 to 15 days At day 21 subjects had increased levels of cycling T cells but no change in regulatory T-cell populations Six subjects had confirmed stable disease for 4 to 10 cycles clear cell and synovial Ipilimumab was safely administered to pediatric patients using management algorithms for immune-related toxicities The spectrum of immune-related adverse events is similar to those described in adults however many of the pediatric toxicities were evident after a single dose Although no objective tumor regressions were observed with ipilimumab as a single agent subjects with immune-related toxicities had an increased overall survival compared with those who showed no evidence of breaking tolerance,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1306, 16, 8, 157, 4, 1040, 250, 986, 230, 850, 9, 24, 1, 113, 84, 44, 656, 4, 541, 1100, 26, 124, 70, 1182, 26, 45, 409, 367, 1159, 2, 4050, 2, 250, 1871, 1, 1306, 468, 6, 976, 22725, 60, 1095, 5, 387, 15, 1014, 537, 57, 61, 1125, 736, 103, 14, 27, 33, 15, 79, 81, 188, 18, 1672, 454, 27, 244, 4, 8, 27, 27, 771, 51, 10, 275, 50, 49, 244, 2, 133, 244, 2, 818, 454, 27, 53, 24, 10, 1351, 1100, 34, 91, 15, 3215, 155, 977, 169, 7, 103, 720, 415, 1, 1306, 7, 346, 42, 78, 133, 78, 269, 15, 127, 430, 537, 57, 78, 39, 250, 139, 290, 281, 159, 4535, 2949, 4132, 12081, 2, 8181, 5, 61, 817, 385, 164, 28, 33, 2, 79, 81, 503, 61, 148, 1159, 553, 8, 1303, 358, 1, 66, 6, 167, 162, 28, 218, 239, 976, 42, 101, 148, 1, 9165, 102, 37, 84, 77, 707, 4, 1253, 102, 31, 1184, 437, 976, 42, 557, 585, 34, 9, 39, 6, 79, 410, 885, 31, 2, 5043, 1306, 10, 2268, 468, 6, 815, 7, 75, 284, 3529, 9, 250, 139, 385, 3, 1873, 1, 250, 139, 290, 281, 16, 288, 6, 135, 1027, 4, 857, 137, 445, 1, 3, 815, 385, 11, 2853, 50, 8, 226, 61, 242, 77, 461, 30, 5142, 11, 164, 5, 1306, 22, 8, 226, 420, 976, 5, 250, 139, 385, 42, 35, 101, 63, 25, 72, 5, 135, 54, 224, 77, 241, 1, 13869, 2614]",1622.0,26534966,2

To examine neurocognitive, neurobehavioral, emotional, and quality-of-life outcomes in long-term survivors of childhood osteosarcoma. Cross-sectional cohort study at an academic research hospital, with prospective treatment and chronic health predictors. Outcome data were collected from June 2008 to August 2014. Data analysis was completed in April 2015. Survivors of osteosarcoma recruited from the St Jude Lifetime Cohort Study were compared with community controls. Neurocognitive function, neurobehavioral symptoms, emotional distress, and quality of life. Outcomes were examined in relation to pharmacokinetic indices of methotrexate exposure and current chronic health conditions, which were assessed through medical examination and coded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.03. Eighty survivors of osteosarcoma (mean [SD] age, 38.9 [7.6] years; time since diagnosis, 24.7 [6.6] years; 42% female) were compared with 39 community controls (age, 39.0 [11.7] years; 56% female). Survivors demonstrated lower mean scores in reading skills (-0.21 [95% CI, -0.32 to -0.10] vs 0.05 [95% CI, -0.13 to 0.23]; P = .01), attention (-0.78 [95% CI, -1.32 to -0.24] vs 0.24 [95% CI, -0.07 to 0.55]; P = .002), memory (-0.24 [95% CI, -0.48 to 0] vs 0.27 [95% CI, -0.08 to 0.62]; P = .01), and processing speed (-0.15 [95% CI, -0.35 to 0.05] vs 0.74 [95% CI, 0.44 to 1.03]; P < .001). Results of pharmacokinetic analysis showed that high-dose methotrexate maximum plasma concentration (estimate = 0; P = .48), median clearance (estimate = -0.11; P = .76), and median/cumulative exposure (estimate = 0; P = .45) were not associated with neurocognitive outcomes. Any grade 3 or 4 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events cardiac, pulmonary, or endocrine condition was associated with poorer memory (t = 2.93; P = .006) and slower processing speed (t = 3.03; P = .002).

NVP-TAE684 reverses multidrug resistance (MDR) in human osteosarcoma by inhibiting P-glycoprotein (PGP1) function.,British journal of pharmacology,Br. J. Pharmacol.,2016-01-15,"Increased expression of P-glycoprotein (PGP1) is one of the major causes of multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer, including in osteosarcoma, which eventually leads to the failure of cancer chemotherapy. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop effective therapeutic strategies to override the expression and function of PGP1 to counter MDR in cancer patients. In an effort to search for new chemical entities targeting PGP1-associated MDR in osteosarcoma, we screened a 500+ compound library of known kinase inhibitors with established kinase selectivity profiles. We aimed to discover potential drug synergistic effects among kinase inhibitors and general chemotherapeutics by combining inhibitors with chemotherapy drugs such as doxorubicin and paclitaxel. The human osteosarcoma MDR cell lines U2OSR2 and KHOSR2 were used for the initial screen and secondary mechanistic studies. After screening 500+ kinase inhibitors, we identified NVP-TAE684 as the most effective MDR reversing agent. NVP-TAE684 significantly reversed chemoresistance when used in combination with doxorubicin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, vincristine, ET-743 or mitoxantrone. NVP-TAE684 itself is not a PGP1 substrate competitive inhibitor, but it can increase the intracellular accumulation of PGP1 substrates in PGP1-overexpressing cell lines. NVP-TAE684 was found to inhibit the function of PGP1 by stimulating PGP1 ATPase activity, a phenomenon reported for other PGP1 inhibitors. The application of NVP-TAE684 to restore sensitivity of osteosarcoma MDR cells to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutics will be useful for further study of PGP1-mediated MDR in human cancer and may ultimately benefit cancer patients.",Journal Article,1467.0,11.0,Increased expression of P-glycoprotein PGP1 is one of the major causes of multidrug resistance MDR in cancer including in which eventually leads to the failure of cancer chemotherapy Thus there is an urgent need to develop effective therapeutic strategies to override the expression and function of PGP1 to counter MDR in cancer patients In an effort to search for new chemical entities targeting PGP1-associated MDR in we screened a 500+ compound library of known kinase inhibitors with established kinase selectivity profiles We aimed to discover potential drug synergistic effects among kinase inhibitors and general chemotherapeutics by combining inhibitors with chemotherapy drugs such as doxorubicin and paclitaxel The human MDR cell lines U2OSR2 and KHOSR2 were used for the initial screen and secondary mechanistic studies After screening 500+ kinase inhibitors we identified NVP-TAE684 as the most effective MDR reversing agent NVP-TAE684 significantly reversed chemoresistance when used in combination with doxorubicin paclitaxel docetaxel vincristine ET-743 or mitoxantrone NVP-TAE684 itself is not a PGP1 substrate competitive inhibitor but it can increase the intracellular accumulation of PGP1 substrates in PGP1-overexpressing cell lines NVP-TAE684 was found to inhibit the function of PGP1 by stimulating PGP1 ATPase activity a phenomenon reported for other PGP1 inhibitors The application of NVP-TAE684 to restore sensitivity of MDR cells to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutics will be useful for further study of PGP1-mediated MDR in human cancer and may ultimately benefit cancer patients,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[101, 55, 1, 19, 4455, 16953, 16, 104, 1, 3, 458, 1626, 1, 4814, 251, 4186, 4, 12, 141, 4, 92, 3124, 1940, 6, 3, 496, 1, 12, 56, 631, 125, 16, 35, 5013, 594, 6, 690, 323, 189, 422, 6, 17358, 3, 55, 2, 343, 1, 16953, 6, 10259, 4186, 4, 12, 7, 4, 35, 2919, 6, 1901, 9, 217, 3743, 4613, 529, 16953, 41, 4186, 4, 21, 2261, 8, 1666, 2823, 4157, 1, 440, 216, 222, 5, 635, 216, 6072, 1241, 21, 1295, 6, 6134, 174, 234, 1806, 176, 107, 216, 222, 2, 1083, 6097, 20, 1525, 222, 5, 56, 600, 225, 22, 856, 2, 490, 3, 171, 4186, 31, 285, 67226, 2, 27394, 11, 95, 9, 3, 388, 2413, 2, 568, 2716, 94, 50, 453, 1666, 216, 222, 21, 108, 5678, 15367, 22, 3, 96, 323, 4186, 9953, 420, 5678, 15367, 97, 3682, 3782, 198, 95, 4, 150, 5, 856, 490, 621, 2132, 2022, 8172, 15, 4419, 5678, 15367, 4045, 16, 44, 8, 16953, 4235, 6487, 230, 84, 192, 122, 344, 3, 2087, 1835, 1, 16953, 6063, 4, 16953, 2810, 31, 285, 5678, 15367, 10, 204, 6, 1433, 3, 343, 1, 16953, 20, 2122, 16953, 11401, 128, 8, 3936, 210, 9, 127, 16953, 222, 3, 1581, 1, 5678, 15367, 6, 6075, 485, 1, 4186, 37, 6, 3, 759, 176, 1, 6097, 303, 40, 999, 9, 195, 45, 1, 16953, 517, 4186, 4, 171, 12, 2, 68, 2050, 247, 12, 7]",1614.0,26603906,109

Recent results from international collaborative trials have failed to demonstrate an ability to improve outcomes using a design in which the randomized question is dictated based on histologic response to preoperative chemotherapy. Novel prognostic markers assessable at diagnosis are vital to identifying subsets of osteosarcoma. Clinical trials focus has now shifted to serial phase II studies of novel agents to evaluate for activity in recurrent and refractory disease. In-depth analyses have revealed profound genomic instability and heterogeneity across patients, with nearly universal TP53 aberration. Although driver mutational events have not clearly been established, frequent derangements in specific pathways may suggest opportunities for therapeutic exploitation.

Clinical and biological significance of PIM1 kinase in osteosarcoma.,Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,J. Orthop. Res.,2015-12-31,"Osteosarcoma is the most prevalent histological form of primary malignant bone tumor. The majority of osteosarcoma patients have limited alternative therapeutic options and metastatic patients generally have a poor prognosis. Proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase PIM1 is associated with growth and survival of many kinds of tumor cells. However, the role of PIM1 in osteosarcoma remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the functional and therapeutic relevance of PIM1 as a putative target in osteosarcoma. We found PIM1 was highly expressed in various osteosarcoma cell lines and in tumor tissues from osteosarcoma patients. Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry analysis showed that the overall and disease-free survival rate of patients with high levels of PIM1 protein expression were significantly shorter than patients with low levels. High levels of PIM1 were also associated with present metastasis and can be considered as an independent prognostic factor in osteosarcoma patients. Knockdown of PIM1 expression by synthetic siRNA or shRNA greatly inhibited cell growth, migration, and invasion. Moreover, these changes accompanied with down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. The similar results were obtained in osteosarcoma cells treated with PIM1 specific inhibitor (SMI-4a). These results suggest that PIM1 kinase is critical for the growth and metastasis of osteosarcoma cells and can be a potential therapeutic target for osteosarcoma treatment. © 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

p53 overexpression increases chemosensitivity in multidrug-resistant osteosarcoma cell lines.,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol.,2015-12-23,"Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major obstacle to the successful treatment of osteosarcoma with chemotherapy. Effectiveness of cancer therapy correlates with the ability to induce a p53-dependent apoptotic response. p53 is a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in 22 % of osteosarcomas. While impaired p53 has been implicated in the oncogenesis of osteosarcoma, it is unclear whether overexpression of wild-type p53 can increase chemosensitivity in MDR osteosarcoma cells. We transfected a plasmid encoding the wild-type p53 gene to MDR osteosarcoma cell lines, which have different p53 statuses, U-2OSR2 with wild-type p53 (Wt-p53) and KHOSR2 with mutant p53 (Mt-p53), and determined the effect of p53 overexpression on chemosensitivities. Both of the U-2OSR2 and KHOSR2 cell lines displayed similar trends in p53-induced drug sensitivities. However, it seems that the impact of p53 overexpression is different based on the differential intrinsic p53 status in these cell lines. In the KHOSR2 cell line (Mt-p53), overexpression of p53 up-regulates the expression of pro-apoptotic protein p21 and Bax, while in the U-2OSR2 cell line (Wt-p53), overexpression of p53 down-regulates IGF-1r expression significantly. These results demonstrated that transfection of wild-type p53 increases chemosensitivity either through inhibiting IGF-1r or through increasing the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins p21 and Bax in human MDR osteosarcoma cell lines.",Journal Article,1490.0,15.0,Multidrug resistance MDR is a major obstacle to the successful treatment of with chemotherapy Effectiveness of cancer therapy correlates with the ability to induce a p53-dependent apoptotic response p53 is a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in 22 of osteosarcomas While impaired p53 has been implicated in the oncogenesis of it is unclear whether overexpression of wild-type p53 can increase chemosensitivity in MDR cells We transfected a plasmid encoding the wild-type p53 gene to MDR cell lines which have different p53 statuses U-2OSR2 with wild-type p53 Wt-p53 and KHOSR2 with mutant p53 Mt-p53 and determined the effect of p53 overexpression on chemosensitivities Both of the U-2OSR2 and KHOSR2 cell lines displayed similar trends in p53-induced drug sensitivities However it seems that the impact of p53 overexpression is different based on the differential intrinsic p53 status in these cell lines In the KHOSR2 cell line Mt-p53 overexpression of p53 up-regulates the expression of pro-apoptotic protein p21 and Bax while in the U-2OSR2 cell line Wt-p53 overexpression of p53 down-regulates IGF-1r expression significantly These results demonstrated that transfection of wild-type p53 increases chemosensitivity either through inhibiting IGF-1r or through increasing the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins p21 and Bax in human MDR cell lines,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4814, 251, 4186, 16, 8, 458, 7414, 6, 3, 1401, 24, 1, 5, 56, 1236, 1, 12, 36, 1871, 5, 3, 801, 6, 1290, 8, 624, 470, 1631, 51, 624, 16, 8, 30, 1245, 145, 17, 16, 1185, 4, 350, 1, 11089, 369, 2364, 624, 71, 85, 1771, 4, 3, 4503, 1, 192, 16, 1200, 317, 851, 1, 955, 267, 624, 122, 344, 5522, 4, 4186, 37, 21, 3245, 8, 6007, 2362, 3, 955, 267, 624, 145, 6, 4186, 31, 285, 92, 47, 338, 624, 12598, 1767, 36162, 5, 955, 267, 624, 1820, 624, 2, 27394, 5, 620, 624, 4875, 624, 2, 509, 3, 254, 1, 624, 851, 23, 67356, 110, 1, 3, 1767, 36162, 2, 27394, 31, 285, 2507, 288, 1963, 4, 624, 277, 234, 6202, 137, 192, 2744, 17, 3, 345, 1, 624, 851, 16, 338, 90, 23, 3, 1777, 2354, 624, 156, 4, 46, 31, 285, 4, 3, 27394, 31, 328, 4875, 624, 851, 1, 624, 126, 2468, 3, 55, 1, 1805, 1631, 178, 2657, 2, 3119, 369, 4, 3, 1767, 36162, 31, 328, 1820, 624, 851, 1, 624, 1328, 2468, 1273, 2994, 55, 97, 46, 99, 264, 17, 3789, 1, 955, 267, 624, 1106, 5522, 361, 298, 2062, 1273, 2994, 15, 298, 602, 3, 55, 1, 1805, 1631, 652, 2657, 2, 3119, 4, 171, 4186, 31, 285]",1355.0,26698867,218
Assessment of extent of surgical resection of primary high-grade osteosarcoma by treating institutions: A report from the Children's Oncology Group.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2016-01-18,"Complete surgical resection of primary tumors is critical for long-term control of high-grade osteosarcoma. Uniform assessment of the extent of surgical resection is important in clinical trials, though the accuracy of this reporting has been poorly studied. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients 5-40 years of age with newly diagnosed high-grade resectable osteosarcoma treated as part of the AOST0331 clinical trial at Children's Oncology Group institutions. The extent of surgical resection of the primary tumor was graded as wide or radical by the treating institution. Central assessment of the extent of resection by two orthopedic oncologists was compared with institutional assessment by reviewing pathology and operative reports. We included 956 patients who had data available for central review. The extent of resection reported by treating institutions was 536/956 (56%) radical and 420/956 (44%) wide. The extent of resection assessed by central review was 162/956 (17%) radical and 794/956 (83%) wide. The overall discordance rate for the cohort was 43%. Institutional reports of radical resection in high-grade osteosarcoma significantly over-estimate the proportion of patients undergoing radical resection.

However, the expression and biologic role of Cryab in osteosarcoma (OS) are still unknown. In this study, we showed that Cryab expression was elevated in OS tissues and cell lines, and down-regulation of Cryab in MG-63 and U-2OS cells led to a decline in the cells' aggressiveness, and reduced secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in vitro, and lower metastasis potential in vivo. Further study indicated that the Cryab expression was positively associated with the activity of ERK1/2 which is responsible for the cells' aggressiveness and MMP-9 secretion. Clinically, our data confirmed that the high level of Cryab was associated with shorten survival and tumor recurrence for the postoperative OS patients.

Evaluation of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression in human osteosarcoma by high-throughput tissue microarray.,Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,J. Orthop. Res.,2016-02-02,"Survival of osteosarcoma patients is currently limited by the development of metastases and multidrug resistance (MDR). A well-established cause of MDR involves overexpression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) in tumor cells. However, some discrepancies still exist as to the clinical significance of Pgp in osteosarcoma. We sought to elucidate further whether the Pgp expression correlated with clinical behavior in a series of patients with osteosarcoma via high-throughput tissue microarray (TMA) analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis of Pgp expression in a TMA of 114 specimens with a retrospective review of 70 osteosarcoma patients admitted to the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) was performed. High Pgp expression was correlated with metastasis development and poor response to pre-operative chemotherapy in osteosarcoma patients. Eighteen of the fifty-seven patients initially admitted with primary osteosarcoma showed high Pgp expression. Among these 18 patients with high Pgp expression, 13 of 18 (72%) patients eventually developed metastases. There was no significant clinical relevance between Pgp expression and osteosarcoma survival. These results support that high expression of Pgp is important, but cannot be assigned as, an individual predictor in the development of human osteosarcoma. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Thoracolumbar spinal cord tolerance to high dose conformal proton-photon radiation therapy.,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,Radiother Oncol,2016-01-11,"To evaluate and understand the tolerance of the thoracolumbar spinal cord using equivalent uniform dose (EUD) and dose volume histogram (DVH) analysis after combined high dose photon-proton radiotherapy. A total of 68 patients were identified as having high dose radiotherapy, ⩾5900cGy (RBE) in the region of the thoracolumbar spinal cord, defined as extending inferiorly to L2. Pathological diagnosis for patients in this review included chordoma (50 patients, 53.1%), chondrosarcoma (28 patients, 29.8%), osteosarcoma (3 patients, 3.2%), other sarcoma (11 patients, 11.7%), and other (2 patients, 2.1%). Patient data were reviewed retrospectively, detailed dose volume histogram data (DVH) were available for 23 patients. Composite plans and DVH were constructed for both pre-operative and post-operative radiation therapy courses in MIM-Vista software, as available. Dose constraints to the center and surface of the cord were 5400cGy (RBE), and 6300cGy (RBE) respectively, and patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy received an eight percent dose reduction. Spinal cord toxicity was recorded using the RTOG/EORTC late effects scoring system. Clinical and dosimetric data for each patient were analyzed. Median prescription dose was 7020cGy (RBE), range (5940-7820cGy (RBE)). Median follow-up was 12.9months. Five-year overall survival for all patients in this group was 88.7%, 95%CI (74.7-95.2). One patient suffered from transient paralysis following stem cell transplant for treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome. Other reasons for spinal cord injury following treatment included: local disease progression, noted in 7 patients (10.3%), and direct result of surgery, noted in 8 patients (11.8%).

Comparison of (18) F-FDG-PET-CT and Bone Scintigraphy for Evaluation of Osseous Metastases in Newly Diagnosed and Recurrent Osteosarcoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2016-04-15,"Bone scintigraphy (BS) is used to detect osseous metastases in osteosarcoma. (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography-computed tomography ((18) F-FDG-PET-CT) is being increasingly used for staging. We compared the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of (18) F-FDG-PET-CT and BS for detecting osseous metastases in osteosarcoma. We retrospectively reviewed 39 patients with osteosarcoma who had paired PET-CT and BS at diagnosis and/or first recurrence from 2003 to 2012. Imaging studies were reviewed by two pediatric imaging specialists who were blinded to results of the opposing modality and reference standard. Reviewers categorized lesions as benign, malignant, or indeterminate. Reference standard for lesion histology was biopsy or clinical follow-up. Diagnostic performance of PET-CT, BS, and combined modalities were determined. There were 40 examinations from 39 patients and 65 distant lesions were evaluated. Median age was 12 years (range 5-19 years). Four patients had 15 osseous metastases at diagnosis (two biopsied and 13 clinically), and two had five osseous metastases at recurrence (one biopsied and five clinically). For distant sites, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were 79%, 89% and 86% for PET-CT, 32%, 96%, and 77% for BS, and 95%, 85%, and 88% for PET-CT/BS combined. Sensitivity of PET-CT was superior to BS (P = 0.035); combined imaging modalities were superior to BS (P < 0.001) but not better than PET-CT alone (P = 0.25). Specificity for BS approached significance compared to combined imaging (P = 0.063). Examination-based analysis yielded similar results between individual and combined imaging modalities.

Assessing the Prognostic Significance of Histologic Response in Osteosarcoma: A Comparison of Outcomes on CCG-782 and INT0133-A Report From the Children's Oncology Group Bone Tumor Committee.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2016-04-29,"The prognostic value of histologic response for osteosarcoma may have changed with induction chemotherapy schedules over time. We hypothesized that the increased intensity of induction therapy provided on INT0133 compared to the Children's Cancer Group study CCG-782 would diminish the impact of histologic response on the risk of events after definitive surgery. Retrospective analysis was performed for patients aged <22 with newly diagnosed nonmetastatic osteosarcoma enrolled on CCG-782 and INT0133. Clinical factors were evaluated for association with response and outcome. Good response was defined as <5% viable tumor at resection. Associations of response, study, and postdefinitive surgery event-free survival (EFS-DS) were determined using Cox proportional hazard models. EFS-DS was estimated by Kaplan-Meier methodology. Data were available for 814 patients (206 CCG-782, 608 INT0133). For good responders, 10-year EFS-DS (±SE) was 75.4% ± 7.7% for CCG-782 and 70.8% ± 3.1% for INT0133. For poor responders, 10-year EFS-DS was 39.9% ± 4.9% for CCG-782 and 58.4% ± 3.1% for INT0133. Histologic response predicted outcome across studies (P < 0.0001). Significant interaction between study and histologic response was observed for EFS-DS (P = 0.011). Using proportional hazards regression, INT0133 poor responders had less risk of events compared to CCG-782 poor responders (relative hazard ratio (RHR) = 0.6:1), but good responders on INT0133 had a greater risk of events compared to CCG-782 good responders (RHR = 1.53:1).

Ninety-two specimens of human osteosarcoma (OS), rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), Ewing family of tumors, desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), and melanoma were analyzed for GD2/GD3 expression by immunohistochemistry. Murine monoclonal antibody 3F8 was used for GD2 staining, and R24 for GD3. Staining was scored according to both intensity and percentage of positive tumor cells from 0 to 4. Both gangliosides were highly prevalent in OS and melanoma. Among other tumors, GD3 expression was higher than GD2 expression. Most OS samples demonstrated strong staining for GD2 and GD3, whereas expression for other tumors was highly variable. Mean intensity of GD2 expression was significantly more heterogeneous (P < 0.001) when compared to GD3 across tumor types. When assessing the difference between GD2 and GD3 expression in all tumor types combined, GD3 expression had a significantly higher score (P = 0.049). When analyzed within each cancer, GD3 expression was significantly higher only in DSRCT (P = 0.002). There was no statistical difference in either GD2 or GD3 expression between primary and recurrent sarcomas. GD2/GD3 expression among pediatric solid tumors is common, albeit with variable level of expression. Especially for patients with sarcoma, these gangliosides can be potential targets for antibody-based therapies.",Journal Article,1315.0,25.0,GD2 and GD3 are the tumor-associated glycolipid antigens found in a broad spectrum of human cancers GD2-specific antibody is currently a standard of care for high-risk therapy In this study the pattern of GD2 and GD3 expression among pediatric/adolescent or young adult tumors was determined providing companion diagnostics for targeted therapy Ninety-two specimens of human OS RMS family of tumors desmoplastic small round cell tumor DSRCT and were analyzed for GD2/GD3 expression by immunohistochemistry Murine monoclonal antibody 3F8 was used for GD2 staining and R24 for GD3 Staining was scored according to both intensity and percentage of positive tumor cells from 0 to 4 Both gangliosides were highly prevalent in OS and Among other tumors GD3 expression was higher than GD2 expression Most OS samples demonstrated strong staining for GD2 and GD3 whereas expression for other tumors was highly variable Mean intensity of GD2 expression was significantly more heterogeneous P 0.001 when compared to GD3 across tumor types When assessing the difference between GD2 and GD3 expression in all tumor types combined GD3 expression had a significantly higher score P 0.049 When analyzed within each cancer GD3 expression was significantly higher only in DSRCT P 0.002 There was no statistical difference in either GD2 or GD3 expression between primary and recurrent sarcomas GD2/GD3 expression among pediatric solid tumors is common albeit with variable level of expression Especially for patients with these gangliosides can be potential targets for antibody-based therapies,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4758, 2, 10973, 32, 3, 30, 41, 21309, 1575, 204, 4, 8, 2094, 1873, 1, 171, 163, 4758, 112, 548, 16, 694, 8, 260, 1, 165, 9, 64, 43, 36, 4, 26, 45, 3, 1177, 1, 4758, 2, 10973, 55, 107, 815, 3678, 15, 1169, 780, 57, 10, 509, 1736, 6639, 5197, 9, 238, 36, 2493, 100, 623, 1, 171, 118, 3413, 607, 1, 57, 5922, 302, 4436, 31, 30, 6996, 2, 11, 311, 9, 4758, 10973, 55, 20, 888, 1471, 848, 548, 5970, 10, 95, 9, 4758, 1029, 2, 68423, 9, 10973, 1029, 10, 3179, 768, 6, 110, 837, 2, 1150, 1, 109, 30, 37, 29, 13, 6, 39, 110, 26314, 11, 561, 2485, 4, 118, 2, 107, 127, 57, 10973, 55, 10, 142, 76, 4758, 55, 96, 118, 347, 264, 1082, 1029, 9, 4758, 2, 10973, 547, 55, 9, 127, 57, 10, 561, 1347, 313, 837, 1, 4758, 55, 10, 97, 80, 1564, 19, 13, 144, 198, 72, 6, 10973, 716, 30, 630, 198, 1977, 3, 523, 59, 4758, 2, 10973, 55, 4, 62, 30, 630, 397, 10973, 55, 42, 8, 97, 142, 368, 19, 13, 5121, 198, 311, 262, 296, 12, 10973, 55, 10, 97, 142, 158, 4, 6996, 19, 13, 1111, 125, 10, 77, 1050, 523, 4, 361, 4758, 15, 10973, 55, 59, 86, 2, 387, 1479, 4758, 10973, 55, 107, 815, 537, 57, 16, 186, 5993, 5, 1347, 301, 1, 55, 1093, 9, 7, 5, 46, 26314, 122, 40, 174, 637, 9, 548, 90, 235]",1575.0,27304202,5
A phase II study of clinical activity of SCH 717454 (robatumumab) in patients with relapsed osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2016-06-30,"Robatumumab (19D12; MK-7454 otherwise known as SCH717454) is a fully human antibody that binds to and inhibits insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 (IGF-1R). This multiinstitutional study (P04720) determined the safety and clinical efficacy of robatumumab in three separate patient groups with resectable osteosarcoma metastases (Group 1), unresectable osteosarcoma metastases (Group 2), and Ewing sarcoma metastases (Group 3). Robatumumab infusions were administered every 2 weeks and were well tolerated with minimal toxicity. Centrally reviewed response data were available for 144 patients. Low disease burden was important for osteosarcoma response: three of 31 patients had complete response or partial response (PR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) in resectable patients (Group 1) versus zero of 29 in unresectable patients (Group 2); median overall survival was 20 months in Group 1 versus 8.2 months in Group 2. In centrally reviewed patients with Ewing sarcoma with PET-CT data (N = 84/115), there were six PR, 23 stable disease, and 55 progression of disease by RECIST at 2 months. Patients with Ewing sarcoma had a median overall survival of 6.9 months. However, responding patients with Ewing sarcoma were allowed to continue on treatment after study closure. A minority of patients with metastatic Ewing sarcoma showed clinical responses and have remained healthy after receiving 25-115 doses of robatumumab with remissions of >4 years duration (N = 6).

"Impacts of Tumor Location, Nature and Bone Destruction of Extremity Osteosarcoma on Selection of Limb Salvage Operative Procedure.",Orthopaedic surgery,Orthop Surg,2016-05-01,"To study the impacts of tumor location, nature and extent of bone destruction on selection of operative protocol for extremity osteosarcoma (OS). The medical records of 201 patients with extremity OS treated in our institute from December 1999 to June 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Ninety eligible patients (56 males and 34 females) of average age 20 ± 11 years (range, 4-40 years) were enrolled. Tumor locations were categorized as diaphyseal (4; diaphysis group) or juxta-articular (86); the latter being subclassified as with (51, type III, epiphysis group) or without invasion beyond the epiphyseal line or plate (35, type I and II, metaphysis group) according to MRI images. Tumor nature (osteogenic, 51; osteolytic, 39) was determined radiologically. Extent of bone destruction was quantitated according to Mirel's scoring system to obtain an ""invasion score"". Regular postoperative follow-up included physical examination and imaging evaluation. Fifty-four patients underwent biological reconstruction and 36 mechanical reconstruction. The mean follow-up duration was 51 months (range, 6-176 months, including four deaths within 12 months). Biological reconstruction was performed more frequently in the diaphysis and metaphysis groups (31/39, 79.5%) than mechanical reconstruction (8/39, 20.5%, P < 0.05). Biological reconstruction and articular preservation were associated with more satisfactory limb function (MSTS scores: 25.0 ± 3.3 and 25.1 ± 3.6) than mechanical reconstruction and articular resection (MSTS scores: 23.4 ± 3.7 and 23.1 ± 3.4, P < 0.05). Reconstruction methods and articular preservation had no relationship with overall or tumor-free survival (P > 0.05). Osteolytic lesions were associated with more extensive bone destruction than osteogenic lesions according to invasion scores (P < 0.05). Following biological reconstruction, high invasion scores (>8) had a 13.5-fold risk of fracture compared with low scores (≤8) (P < 0.05). Twenty-one subjects had recurrences, 30 metastases and 26 died. Postoperative complications included infection (6), fracture (10), and prosthesis loosening (4). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated 5- and 10-year survival rates of 68.9% and 62.8%, respectively, and 5- and 10-year tumor-free survival rates of 66.7% and 57.8%, respectively. Selection of limb salvage operative protocol for extremity OS should rely on tumor location, nature and extent of bone destruction.

"Outcome of Patients With Recurrent Osteosarcoma Enrolled in Seven Phase II Trials Through Children's Cancer Group, Pediatric Oncology Group, and Children's Oncology Group: Learning From the Past to Move Forward.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-07-11,"The use of radiographic response as the primary end point in phase II osteosarcoma trials may limit optimal detection of treatment response because of the calcified tumor matrix. We performed this study to determine if time to progression could be used as an end point for subsequent studies. We performed a retrospective analysis of outcome for patients with recurrent/refractory osteosarcoma enrolled in one of seven phase II trials conducted by the Children's Oncology Group and predecessor groups from 1997 to 2007. All trials used RECIST or WHO radiographic response criteria and the primary end point of response rate. The following potential prognostic factors-age, trial, number of prior chemotherapy regimens, sex, and race/ethnicity-were evaluated for their impact on event-free survival (EFS). We used data from a phase II study (AOST0221) of patients with osteosarcoma who were given inhaled granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor with first pulmonary recurrence who had an EFS as well as biologic end point to determine the historical disease control rate for patients with fully resected disease. In each included trial, the drugs tested were determined to be inactive on the basis of radiographic response rates. The EFS for 96 patients with osteosarcoma and measurable disease was 12% at 4 months (95% CI, 6% to 19%). There was no significant difference in EFS across trials according to number of prior treatment regimens or patient age, sex, and ethnicity.

Ninety-two patients with Ewing sarcoma (N = 47), osteosarcoma (N = 22), chondrosarcoma (N = 16), and other tumors (N = 7) were evaluated; 78 were enrolled in at least 1 of 43 different phase I trials. The median overall survival (OS) was 8.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.8-13.7 months). Independent factors that predicted shorter survival were male sex, >2 metastatic sites, >3 previous therapies, hemoglobin level <10.5 g/dL, platelet count >200 x103/L, creatinine level ≥1.3 mg/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase level >ULN. Patients with good RMH scores (0-1) had longer OS than patients with poor RMH scores (2-3) (HR = 5.8, 95% CI = 2.9-11.0; P < 0.0001), as did patients with low MDACC scores (0-1) as compared to patients with higher MDACC scores (2-4) (HR = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.9-5.6; P < 0.0001).

"Comparison of MAPIE versus MAP in patients with a poor response to preoperative chemotherapy for newly diagnosed high-grade osteosarcoma (EURAMOS-1): an open-label, international, randomised controlled trial.",The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2016-08-25,"We designed the EURAMOS-1 trial to investigate whether intensified postoperative chemotherapy for patients whose tumour showed a poor response to preoperative chemotherapy (≥10% viable tumour) improved event-free survival in patients with high-grade osteosarcoma. EURAMOS-1 was an open-label, international, phase 3 randomised, controlled trial. Consenting patients with newly diagnosed, resectable, high-grade osteosarcoma aged 40 years or younger were eligible for randomisation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either postoperative cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate (MAP) or MAP plus ifosfamide and etoposide (MAPIE) using concealed permuted blocks with three stratification factors: trial group; location of tumour (proximal femur or proximal humerus vs other limb vs axial skeleton); and presence of metastases (no vs yes or possible). The MAP regimen consisted of cisplatin 120 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, doxorubicin 37·5 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day on days 1 and 2 (on weeks 1 and 6) followed 3 weeks later by high-dose methotrexate 12 g/m<sup>2</sup> over 4 h. The MAPIE regimen consisted of MAP as a base regimen, with the addition of high-dose ifosfamide (14 g/m<sup>2</sup>) at 2·8 g/m<sup>2</sup> per day with equidose mesna uroprotection, followed by etoposide 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day over 1 h on days 1-5. The primary outcome measure was event-free survival measured in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00134030. Between April 14, 2005, and June 30, 2011, 2260 patients were registered from 325 sites in 17 countries. 618 patients with poor response were randomly assigned; 310 to receive MAP and 308 to receive MAPIE. Median follow-up was 62·1 months (IQR 46·6-76·6); 62·3 months (IQR 46·9-77·1) for the MAP group and 61·1 months (IQR 46·5-75·3) for the MAPIE group. 307 event-free survival events were reported (153 in the MAP group vs 154 in the MAPIE group). 193 deaths were reported (101 in the MAP group vs 92 in the MAPIE group). Event-free survival did not differ between treatment groups (hazard ratio [HR] 0·98 [95% CI 0·78-1·23]); hazards were non-proportional (p=0·0003). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (268 [89%] patients in MAP vs 268 [90%] in MAPIE), thrombocytopenia (231 [78% in MAP vs 248 [83%] in MAPIE), and febrile neutropenia without documented infection (149 [50%] in MAP vs 217 [73%] in MAPIE). MAPIE was associated with more frequent grade 4 non-haematological toxicity than MAP (35 [12%] of 301 in the MAP group vs 71 [24%] of 298 in the MAPIE group). Two patients died during postoperative therapy, one from infection (although their absolute neutrophil count was normal), which was definitely related to their MAP treatment (specifically doxorubicin and cisplatin), and one from left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which was probably related to MAPIE treatment (specifically doxorubicin). One suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction was reported in the MAP group: bone marrow infarction due to methotrexate. EURAMOS-1 results do not support the addition of ifosfamide and etoposide to postoperative chemotherapy in patients with poorly responding osteosarcoma because its administration was associated with increased toxicity without improving event-free survival. The results define standard of care for this population. New strategies are required to improve outcomes in this setting.

Prospective study of neuropathic pain after definitive surgery for extremity osteosarcoma in a pediatric population.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2016-08-30,"Neuropathic pain (NP) after definitive surgery for extremity osteosarcoma (OS) has not been previously characterized. This study prospectively investigates the incidence, duration, and treatment of NP in limb sparing surgery and amputation groups. In patients treated for OS on a chemotherapy and definitive surgery (limb sparing vs. amputation) protocol (OS08), we prospectively collected the following data: (i) demographical data (age, sex, race); (ii) NP time of onset and duration; and (iii) dose (starting, maximum) and duration of gabapentin, amitriptyline, and methadone treatment. Thirty-seven patients underwent 38 definitive surgeries: limb sparing (26, 68.4%) or amputations (12, 31.6%). Localization included lower extremity (30, 81%), upper extremity (6, 16%), or pelvis (1, 3%). Thirty patients (81%) developed NP and 26 of them required NP-specific medications (87.7%). The mean [standard deviation (SD)] duration of NP was 6.5 weeks (7.2) (median 4.4, range 0.3-29.9). All 26 patients (27 surgeries) treated with NP medications received gabapentin, either as single therapy (65.4%) (17 patients, 18 surgeries), dual therapy with gabapentin and amitriptyline (five patients), or triple therapy with gabapentin, amitriptyline, and methadone (four patients). The mean starting (maximum) doses of gabapentin, amitriptyline, and methadone (mg/kg/day) were 20.2 (43.8), 0.5 (0.7), and 0.3 (0.3), respectively.

Effect of Temporal Changes in Therapeutic Exposure on Self-reported Health Status in Childhood Cancer Survivors.,Annals of internal medicine,Ann. Intern. Med.,2016-11-08,"The effect of temporal changes in cancer therapy on health status among childhood cancer survivors has not been evaluated. To compare proportions of self-reported adverse health status outcomes among childhood cancer survivors across 3 decades. Cross-sectional. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01120353). 27 North American institutions. 14 566 adults, who survived for 5 or more years after initial diagnosis (median age, 27 years; range, 18 to 48 years), treated from 1970 to 1999. Patient report of poor general or mental health, functional impairment, activity limitation, or cancer-related anxiety or pain was evaluated as a function of treatment decade, cancer treatment exposure, chronic health conditions, demographic characteristics, and health habits. Despite reductions in late mortality and the proportions of survivors with severe, disabling, or life-threatening chronic health conditions (33.4% among those treated from 1970 to 1979 and 21.0% among those treated from 1990 to 1999), those reporting adverse health status did not decrease by treatment decade. Compared with survivors diagnosed in 1970 to 1979, those diagnosed in 1990 to 1999 were more likely to report poor general health (11.2% vs. 13.7%; P < 0.001) and cancer-related anxiety (13.3% vs. 15.0%; P < 0.001). From 1970 to 1979 and 1990 to 1999, the proportions of survivors reporting adverse outcomes were higher (P < 0.001) among those with leukemia (poor general health, 9.5% and 13.9%) and osteosarcoma (pain, 23.9% and 36.6%). Temporal changes in treatment exposures were not associated with changes in the proportions of survivors reporting adverse health status. Smoking, not meeting physical activity guidelines, and being either underweight or obese were associated with poor health status. Considerable improvement in survival among children diagnosed with cancer in the 1990s compared with those diagnosed in the 1970s makes it difficult to definitively determine the effect of risk factors on later self-reported health status without considering their effect on mortality.

Targeting ABCB1 (MDR1) in multi-drug resistant osteosarcoma cells using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to reverse drug resistance.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2016-12-01,"Multi-drug resistance (MDR) remains a significant obstacle to successful chemotherapy treatment for osteosarcoma patients. One of the central causes of MDR is the overexpression of the membrane bound drug transporter protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is the protein product of the MDR gene ABCB1. Though several methods have been reported to reverse MDR in vitro and in vivo when combined with anticancer drugs, they have yet to be proven useful in the clinical setting. The meta-analysis demonstrated that a high level of P-gp may predict poor survival in patients with osteosarcoma. The expression of P-gp can be efficiently blocked by the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated Cas9 system (CRISPR-Cas9). Inhibition of ABCB1 was associated with reversing drug resistance in osteosarcoma MDR cell lines (KHOSR2 and U-2OSR2) to doxorubicin. We performed a meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between P-gp expression and survival in patients with osteosarcoma. Then we adopted the CRISPR-Cas9, a robust and highly efficient novel genome editing tool, to determine its effect on reversing drug resistance by targeting endogenous ABCB1 gene at the DNA level in osteosarcoma MDR cell lines. These results suggest that the CRISPR-Cas9 system is a useful tool for the modification of ABCB1 gene, and may be useful in extending the long-term efficacy of chemotherapy by overcoming P-gp-mediated MDR in the clinical setting.",Journal Article,1146.0,22.0,Multi-drug resistance MDR remains a significant obstacle to successful chemotherapy treatment for patients One of the central causes of MDR is the overexpression of the membrane bound drug transporter protein P-glycoprotein P-gp which is the protein product of the MDR gene ABCB1 Though several methods have been reported to reverse MDR in vitro and in vivo when combined with anticancer drugs they have yet to be proven useful in the clinical setting The meta-analysis demonstrated that a high level of P-gp may predict poor survival in patients with The expression of P-gp can be efficiently blocked by the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats CRISPR -associated Cas9 system CRISPR-Cas9 Inhibition of ABCB1 was associated with reversing drug resistance in MDR cell lines KHOSR2 and U-2OSR2 to doxorubicin We performed a meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between P-gp expression and survival in patients with Then we adopted the CRISPR-Cas9 a robust and highly efficient novel genome editing tool to determine its effect on reversing drug resistance by targeting endogenous ABCB1 gene at the DNA level in MDR cell lines These results suggest that the CRISPR-Cas9 system is a useful tool for the modification of ABCB1 gene and may be useful in extending the long-term efficacy of chemotherapy by overcoming P-gp-mediated MDR in the clinical setting,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1414, 234, 251, 4186, 469, 8, 93, 7414, 6, 1401, 56, 24, 9, 7, 104, 1, 3, 854, 1626, 1, 4186, 16, 3, 851, 1, 3, 1905, 2951, 234, 5246, 178, 19, 4455, 19, 5407, 92, 16, 3, 178, 2821, 1, 3, 4186, 145, 6560, 2471, 392, 636, 47, 85, 210, 6, 1772, 4186, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 198, 397, 5, 1475, 600, 491, 47, 1145, 6, 40, 1930, 999, 4, 3, 38, 546, 3, 1742, 65, 264, 17, 8, 64, 301, 1, 19, 5407, 68, 678, 334, 25, 4, 7, 5, 3, 55, 1, 19, 5407, 122, 40, 4143, 2582, 20, 3, 6464, 7469, 29756, 978, 29757, 7197, 7736, 41, 9071, 398, 7736, 9071, 297, 1, 6560, 10, 41, 5, 9953, 234, 251, 4, 4186, 31, 285, 27394, 2, 1767, 36162, 6, 856, 21, 173, 8, 1742, 65, 6, 963, 3, 858, 59, 19, 5407, 55, 2, 25, 4, 7, 5, 818, 21, 4457, 3, 7736, 9071, 8, 1922, 2, 561, 2547, 229, 898, 6120, 1515, 6, 223, 211, 254, 23, 9953, 234, 251, 20, 529, 2682, 6560, 145, 28, 3, 261, 301, 4, 4186, 31, 285, 46, 99, 309, 17, 3, 7736, 9071, 398, 16, 8, 999, 1515, 9, 3, 2437, 1, 6560, 145, 2, 68, 40, 999, 4, 4782, 3, 319, 337, 209, 1, 56, 20, 5344, 19, 5407, 517, 4186, 4, 3, 38, 546]",1381.0,27835872,148

miR-15b modulates multidrug resistance in human osteosarcoma in vitro and in vivo.,Molecular oncology,Mol Oncol,2016-10-24,"The development of multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs continues to be a major clinical problem. MicroRNAs (miRNA, miR) play an important role in regulating tumour cell growth and survival; however, the role of miRs in the development of drug resistance in osteosarcoma cells is largely uncharacterized. We sought to identify and characterize human miRs that act as key regulators of MDR in osteosarcoma. We utilized a miR microarray to screen for differentially expressed miRs in osteosarcoma MDR cell lines. We determined the mechanisms of the deregulation of expression of miR-15b in osteosarcoma MDR cell lines, and its association with clinically obtained tumour samples was examined in tissue microarray (TMA). The significance of miR-15b in reversing drug resistance was evaluated in a mouse xenograft model of MDR osteosarcoma. We identified miR-15b as being significantly (P < 0.01) downregulated in KHOS<sub>MR</sub> and U-2OS<sub>MR</sub> cell lines as compared with their parental cell lines. We found that Wee1 is a target gene of miR-15b and observed that transfection with miR-15b inhibits Wee1 expression and partially reverses MDR in osteosarcoma cell lines. Systemic in vivo administration of miR-15b mimics sensitizes resistant cells to doxorubicin and induces cell death in MDR models of osteosarcoma. Clinically, reduced miR-15b expression was associated with poor patient survival. Osteosarcoma patients with low miR-15b expression levels had significantly shorter survival times than patients with high expression levels of miR-15b.

Longitudinal follow-up of adult survivors of Ewing sarcoma: A report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,Cancer,Cancer,2017-02-21,"Ewing sarcoma survivors (ESSs) are at increased risk for treatment-related complications. The incidence of treatment-related morbidity and late mortality with aging is unknown. This study reports survival probabilities, estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method, and the cumulative incidence of cause-specific mortality and chronic conditions among ESSs in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study who were treated between 1970 and 1986. Piecewise exponential models were used to estimate relative rates (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for these outcomes. Chronic conditions were graded with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). Among 404 5-year ESSs (median age at last follow-up, 34.8 years; range, 9.1-54.8 years), the 35-year survival rate was 70% (95% CI, 66%-74%). Late recurrence (cumulative incidence at 35 years, 15.1%) was the most common cause of death, and it was followed by treatment-related causes (11.2%). There were 53 patients with subsequent neoplasms (SNs; cumulative incidence at 35 years, 24.0%), and 38 were malignant (14.3% at 35 years). The standardized incidence ratios were 377.1 (95% CI, 172.1-715.9) for osteosarcoma, 28.9 (95% CI, 3.2-104.2) for acute myeloid leukemia, 14.9 (95% CI, 7.9-25.5) for breast cancer, and 13.1 (95% CI, 4.8-28.5) for thyroid cancer. Rates of chronic conditions were highest for musculoskeletal (RR, 18.1; 95% CI, 12.8-25.7) and cardiac complications (RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.4-2.3). Thirty-five years after the diagnosis, the cumulative incidences of any chronic conditions and 2 or more chronic conditions were 84.6% (95% CI, 80.4%-88.8%) and 73.8% (95% CI, 67.8%-79.9%), respectively. With extended follow-up, ESSs' risk for late mortality and SNs does not plateau. Treatment-related chronic conditions develop years after therapy, and this supports the need for lifelong follow-up.

Genomic data from more than 20,000 cancer genomes provide a wealth of information on cancer gene alterations and have confirmed <i>TP53</i> as the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer. Analysis of a database of 70,000 <i>TP53</i> variants reveals that the two newly discovered exons of the gene, exons 9β and 9γ, generated by alternative splicing, are the targets of inactivating mutation events in breast, liver, and head and neck tumors. Furthermore, germline rearrange-ments in intron 1 of <i>TP53</i> are associated with LFS and are frequently observed in sporadic osteosarcoma. In this context of constantly growing genomic data, we discuss how screening strategies must be improved when assessing <i>TP53</i> status in clinical samples.

Previously, we have found that cyclin-dependent kinase 11 (CDK11) signaling was essential for osteosarcoma cell growth and survival. Subsequently, CDK11 siRNA gene targeting, expression profiling, and network reconstruction of differentially expressed genes were performed between CDK11 knock down and wild type osteosarcoma cells. Reconstructed network of the differentially expressed genes pointed to the AR as key to CDK11 signaling in osteosarcoma. CDK11 increased transcriptional activation of AR gene in osteosarcoma cell lines. AR protein was highly expressed in various osteosarcoma cell lines and patient tumor tissues. Tissue microarray analysis showed that the disease-free survival rate for patients with high-expression of AR was significantly shorter than for patients with low-expression of AR. In addition, AR gene expression knockdown via siRNA greatly inhibited cell growth and viability. Similar results were found in osteosarcoma cells treated with AR inhibitor.

Targeting programmed cell death ligand 1 by CRISPR/Cas9 in osteosarcoma cells.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2017-05-01,"Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a transmembrane protein that is expressed on tumor cells that suppresses the T cell-mediated immune response. Therapies targeting the PD-L1 pathway promote anti-tumor immunity and have shown promising results in some types of cancers. However, the functional and therapeutic roles of PD-L1 in osteosarcoma remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that PD-L1 protein was expressed in osteosarcoma cell lines and tissue microarray of patient tumors. Tissue microarray immunohistochemistry analysis showed that the overall and five-year survival rates of patients with high levels of PD-L1 expression were significantly shorter than patients with low levels. High levels of PD-L1 expression were also associated with metastasis in osteosarcoma patients. Furthermore, we applied the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system to target PD-L1 gene at the DNA level in osteosarcoma cell lines. We found that the expression of PD-L1 could be efficiently disrupted by CRISPR/Cas9 system and PD-L1 knockdown increased drug sensitivities for doxorubicin and paclitaxel.

Clinical genomic profiling to identify actionable alterations for investigational therapies in patients with diverse sarcomas.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2017-06-01,"There are currently no United States Food and Drug Administration approved molecularly matched therapies for sarcomas except gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Complicating this is the extreme diversity, heterogeneity, and rarity of these neoplasms. Few therapeutic options exist for relapsed and refractory sarcomas. In clinical practice many oncologists refer patients for genomic profiling hoping for guidance on treatment options after standard therapy. However, a systematic analysis of actionable mutations has yet to be completed. We analyzed genomic profiling results in patients referred to MD Anderson Cancer Center with advanced sarcomas to elucidate the frequency of potentially actionable genomic alterations in this population. We reviewed charts of patients with advanced sarcoma who were referred to investigational cancer therapeutics department and had CLIA certified comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) of 236 or 315 cancer genes in at least 50ng of DNA. Actionable alterations were defined as those identifying anti-cancer drugs on the market, in registered clinical trials, or in the Drug-Gene Interaction Database. Among the 102 patients analyzed median age was 45.5 years (range 8-76), M: F ratio 48:54. The most common subtypes seen in our study were leiomyosarcoma (18.6%), dedifferentiated liposarcoma (11%), osteosarcoma (11%), well-differentiated liposarcoma (7%), carcinosarcoma (6%), and rhabdomyosarcoma (6%). Ninety-five out of 102 patients (93%) had at least one genomic alteration identified with a mean of six mutations per patient. Of the 95 biopsy samples with identifiable genomic alterations, the most commonly affected genes were TP53 (31.4%), CDK4 (23.5%), MDM2 (21.6%), RB1 (18.6%), and CDKN2A/B (13.7%). Notable co-segregating amplifications included MDM2-CDK4 and FRS2-FGF. Sixteen percent of patients received targeted therapy based on CGP of which 50% had at least stable disease. Incorporating CGP into sarcoma management may allow for more precise diagnosis and sub-classification of this diverse and rare disease, as well as personalized matching of patients to targeted therapies such as those available in basket clinical trials.",Journal Article,964.0,,There are currently no United States Food and Drug Administration approved molecularly matched therapies for sarcomas except stromal tumors Complicating this is the extreme diversity heterogeneity and rarity of these neoplasms Few therapeutic options exist for relapsed and refractory sarcomas In clinical practice many oncologists refer patients for genomic profiling hoping for guidance on treatment options after standard therapy However a systematic analysis of actionable mutations has yet to be completed We analyzed genomic profiling results in patients referred to MD Anderson Cancer Center with advanced sarcomas to elucidate the frequency of potentially actionable genomic alterations in this population We reviewed charts of patients with advanced who were referred to investigational cancer therapeutics department and had CLIA certified comprehensive genomic profiling CGP of 236 or 315 cancer genes in at least 50ng of DNA Actionable alterations were defined as those identifying anti-cancer drugs on the market in registered clinical trials or in the Drug-Gene Interaction Database Among the 102 patients analyzed median age was 45.5 years range 8-76 M F ratio 48:54 The most common subtypes seen in our study were leiomyosarcoma 18.6 dedifferentiated liposarcoma 11 11 well-differentiated liposarcoma 7 carcinosarcoma 6 and 6 Ninety-five out of 102 patients 93 had at least one genomic alteration identified with a mean of six mutations per patient Of the 95 biopsy samples with identifiable genomic alterations the most commonly affected genes were TP53 31.4 CDK4 23.5 MDM2 21.6 RB1 18.6 and CDKN2A/B 13.7 Notable co-segregating amplifications included MDM2-CDK4 and FRS2-FGF Sixteen percent of patients received targeted therapy based on CGP of which 50 had at least stable disease Incorporating CGP into management may allow for more precise diagnosis and sub-classification of this diverse and rare disease as well as personalized matching of patients to targeted therapies such as those available in basket clinical trials,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[125, 32, 694, 77, 1088, 907, 1773, 2, 234, 634, 850, 2372, 655, 235, 9, 1479, 2187, 1126, 57, 13630, 26, 16, 3, 5611, 3653, 1144, 2, 4989, 1, 46, 1179, 1021, 189, 838, 1923, 9, 591, 2, 430, 1479, 4, 38, 758, 445, 1339, 7851, 7, 9, 572, 1080, 29715, 9, 2753, 23, 24, 838, 50, 260, 36, 137, 8, 1556, 65, 1, 2856, 138, 71, 1145, 6, 40, 781, 21, 311, 572, 1080, 99, 4, 7, 1995, 6, 2244, 1929, 12, 574, 5, 131, 1479, 6, 3061, 3, 675, 1, 751, 2856, 572, 593, 4, 26, 266, 21, 446, 4413, 1, 7, 5, 131, 54, 11, 1995, 6, 3093, 12, 1943, 4271, 2, 42, 10375, 8972, 949, 572, 1080, 7621, 1, 6383, 15, 7362, 12, 214, 4, 28, 506, 70214, 1, 261, 2856, 593, 11, 395, 22, 135, 1386, 312, 12, 600, 23, 3, 9763, 4, 1653, 38, 143, 15, 4, 3, 234, 145, 915, 609, 107, 3, 2867, 7, 311, 52, 89, 10, 512, 33, 60, 184, 66, 846, 188, 1068, 197, 576, 667, 3, 96, 186, 814, 527, 4, 114, 45, 11, 3717, 203, 49, 6275, 3259, 175, 175, 149, 1442, 3259, 67, 5623, 49, 2, 49, 2493, 365, 1205, 1, 2867, 7, 966, 42, 28, 506, 104, 572, 2611, 108, 5, 8, 313, 1, 437, 138, 379, 69, 1, 3, 48, 411, 347, 5, 6237, 572, 593, 3, 96, 841, 1424, 214, 11, 1206, 456, 39, 3254, 382, 33, 3277, 239, 49, 4596, 203, 49, 2, 3175, 132, 233, 67, 4090, 1269, 23435, 4877, 159, 3277, 3254, 2, 21833, 6517, 3228, 714, 1, 7, 103, 238, 36, 90, 23, 7621, 1, 92, 212, 42, 28, 506, 585, 34, 2570, 7621, 237, 284, 68, 1700, 9, 80, 3260, 147, 2, 551, 947, 1, 26, 1867, 2, 622, 34, 22, 149, 22, 2175, 2616, 1, 7, 6, 238, 235, 225, 22, 135, 390, 4, 17059, 38, 143]",2043.0,28424409,257
The role of revision surgery and adjuvant therapy following subtotal resection of osteosarcoma of the spine: a systematic review with meta-analysis.,Journal of neurosurgery. Spine,J Neurosurg Spine,2017-04-28,"OBJECTIVE Primary osteosarcoma of the spine is a rare osseous neoplasm. While previously reported retrospective studies have demonstrated that overall patient survival is impacted mostly by en bloc resection and chemotherapy, the continued management of residual disease remains to be elucidated. This systematic review was designed to address the role of revision surgery and multimodal adjuvant therapy in cases in which en bloc excision is not initially achieved. METHODS A systematic literature search spanning the years 1966 to 2015 was performed on PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science to identify reports describing outcomes of patients who underwent biopsy alone, neurological decompression, or intralesional resection for osteosarcoma of the spine. Studies were reviewed qualitatively, and the clinical course of individual patients was aggregated for quantitative meta-analysis. RESULTS A total of 16 studies were identified for inclusion in the systematic review, of which 8 case reports were summarized qualitatively. These studies strongly support the role of chemotherapy for overall survival and moderately support adjuvant radiation therapy for local control. The meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant benefit in overall survival for performing revision tumor debulking (p = 0.01) and also for chemotherapy at relapse (p < 0.01). Adjuvant radiation therapy was associated with longer survival, although this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS While the initial therapeutic goal in the management of osteosarcoma of the spine is neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by en bloc marginal resection, this objective is not always achievable given anatomical constraints and other limitations at the time of initial clinical presentation. This systematic review supports the continued aggressive use of revision surgery and multimodal adjuvant therapy when possible to improve outcomes in patients who initially undergo subtotal debulking of osteosarcoma. A limitation of this systematic review is that lesions amenable to subsequent resection or tumors inherently more sensitive to adjuvants would exaggerate a therapeutic effect of these interventions when studied in a retrospective fashion.",Journal Article,998.0,8.0,OBJECTIVE Primary of the spine is a rare osseous neoplasm While previously reported retrospective studies have demonstrated that overall patient survival is impacted mostly by en bloc resection and chemotherapy the continued management of residual disease remains to be elucidated This systematic review was designed to address the role of revision surgery and multimodal adjuvant therapy in cases in which en bloc excision is not initially achieved METHODS A systematic literature search spanning the years 1966 to 2015 was performed on PubMed Medline EMBASE and Web of Science to identify reports describing outcomes of patients who underwent biopsy alone neurological decompression or intralesional resection for of the spine Studies were reviewed qualitatively and the clinical course of individual patients was aggregated for quantitative meta-analysis RESULTS A total of 16 studies were identified for inclusion in the systematic review of which 8 case reports were summarized qualitatively These studies strongly support the role of chemotherapy for overall survival and moderately support adjuvant radiation therapy for local control The meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant benefit in overall survival for performing revision tumor debulking p 0.01 and also for chemotherapy at relapse p 0.01 Adjuvant radiation therapy was associated with longer survival although this did not reach statistical significance p 0.06 CONCLUSIONS While the initial therapeutic goal in the management of of the spine is neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by en bloc marginal resection this objective is not always achievable given anatomical constraints and other limitations at the time of initial clinical presentation This systematic review supports the continued aggressive use of revision surgery and multimodal adjuvant therapy when possible to improve outcomes in patients who initially undergo subtotal debulking of A limitation of this systematic review is that lesions amenable to subsequent resection or tumors inherently more sensitive to adjuvants would exaggerate a therapeutic effect of these interventions when studied in a retrospective fashion,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[461, 86, 1, 3, 2342, 16, 8, 622, 5230, 2131, 369, 373, 210, 459, 94, 47, 264, 17, 63, 69, 25, 16, 4619, 2754, 20, 4375, 5590, 170, 2, 56, 3, 1351, 284, 1, 753, 34, 469, 6, 40, 3901, 26, 1556, 206, 10, 1114, 6, 1539, 3, 200, 1, 5646, 152, 2, 4122, 249, 36, 4, 140, 4, 92, 4375, 5590, 1366, 16, 44, 1625, 513, 636, 8, 1556, 789, 1901, 7155, 3, 60, 11556, 6, 1483, 10, 173, 23, 3161, 3388, 4995, 2, 3469, 1, 3797, 6, 255, 1198, 4950, 123, 1, 7, 54, 208, 411, 279, 3622, 7638, 15, 7549, 170, 9, 1, 3, 2342, 94, 11, 446, 8040, 2, 3, 38, 906, 1, 797, 7, 10, 12659, 9, 1156, 1742, 65, 99, 8, 181, 1, 245, 94, 11, 108, 9, 1680, 4, 3, 1556, 206, 1, 92, 66, 473, 1198, 11, 3989, 8040, 46, 94, 1327, 538, 3, 200, 1, 56, 9, 63, 25, 2, 3508, 538, 249, 121, 36, 9, 293, 182, 3, 1742, 65, 553, 8, 712, 93, 247, 4, 63, 25, 9, 3620, 5646, 30, 3556, 19, 13, 355, 2, 120, 9, 56, 28, 429, 19, 13, 355, 249, 121, 36, 10, 41, 5, 589, 25, 242, 26, 205, 44, 3690, 1050, 724, 19, 13, 1460, 2130, 369, 3, 388, 189, 1326, 4, 3, 284, 1, 1, 3, 2342, 16, 536, 56, 370, 20, 4375, 5590, 3450, 170, 26, 461, 16, 44, 3763, 6171, 447, 5024, 4879, 2, 127, 1939, 28, 3, 98, 1, 388, 38, 1031, 26, 1556, 206, 2304, 3, 1351, 571, 119, 1, 5646, 152, 2, 4122, 249, 36, 198, 899, 6, 401, 123, 4, 7, 54, 1625, 1251, 5503, 3556, 1, 8, 5039, 1, 26, 1556, 206, 16, 17, 406, 4070, 6, 706, 170, 15, 57, 11183, 80, 745, 6, 8654, 688, 70298, 8, 189, 254, 1, 46, 1151, 198, 656, 4, 8, 459, 3240]",2163.0,28452631,7
An imprinted non-coding genomic cluster at 14q32 defines clinically relevant molecular subtypes in osteosarcoma across multiple independent datasets.,Journal of hematology & oncology,J Hematol Oncol,2017-05-15,"A microRNA (miRNA) collection on the imprinted 14q32 MEG3 region has been associated with outcome in osteosarcoma. We assessed the clinical utility of this miRNA set and their association with methylation status. We integrated coding and non-coding RNA data from three independent annotated clinical osteosarcoma cohorts (n = 65, n = 27, and n = 25) and miRNA and methylation data from one in vitro (19 cell lines) and one clinical (NCI Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) osteosarcoma dataset, n = 80) dataset. We used time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (tdROC) analysis to evaluate the clinical value of candidate miRNA profiles and machine learning approaches to compare the coding and non-coding transcriptional programs of high- and low-risk osteosarcoma tumors and high- versus low-aggressiveness cell lines. In the cell line and TARGET datasets, we also studied the methylation patterns of the MEG3 imprinting control region on 14q32 and their association with miRNA expression and tumor aggressiveness. In the tdROC analysis, miRNA sets on 14q32 showed strong discriminatory power for recurrence and survival in the three clinical datasets. High- or low-risk tumor classification was robust to using different microRNA sets or classification methods. Machine learning approaches showed that genome-wide miRNA profiles and miRNA regulatory networks were quite different between the two outcome groups and mRNA profiles categorized the samples in a manner concordant with the miRNAs, suggesting potential molecular subtypes. Further, miRNA expression patterns were reproducible in comparing high-aggressiveness versus low-aggressiveness cell lines. Methylation patterns in the MEG3 differentially methylated region (DMR) also distinguished high-aggressiveness from low-aggressiveness cell lines and were associated with expression of several 14q32 miRNAs in both the cell lines and the large TARGET clinical dataset.

Advances in the Treatment of Pediatric Bone Sarcomas.,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book. American Society of Clinical Oncology. Annual Meeting,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,2017-01-01,"Bone tumors make up a significant portion of noncentral nervous system solid tumor diagnoses in pediatric oncology patients. Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma, both with distinct clinical and pathologic features, are the two most commonly encountered bone cancers in pediatrics. Although mutations in the germline have classically been more associated with osteosarcoma, there is recent evidence germline alterations in patients with Ewing sarcoma also play a significant role in pathogenesis. Treatment advances in this patient population have lagged behind that of other pediatric malignancies, particularly targeted interventions directed at the biologic underpinnings of disease. Recent advances in biologic and genomic understanding of these two cancers has expanded the potential for therapeutic advancement and prevention. In Ewing sarcoma, directed focus on inhibition of EWSR1-FLI1 and its effectors has produced promising results. In osteosarcoma, instead of a concentrated focus on one particular change, largely due to tumor heterogeneity, a more diversified approach has been adopted including investigations of growth factors inhibitors, signaling pathway inhibitors, and immune modulation. Continuing recently made treatment advances relies on clinical trial design and enrollment. Clinical trials should include incorporation of biological findings; specifically, for Ewing sarcoma, assessment of alternative fusions and, for osteosarcoma, stratification utilizing biomarkers.

Whole-body images were obtained approximately 1 h after injection of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG. Logistic regression was used to study the association of tumor uptake and changes in SUV<sub>max</sub> between 0, 5, and 10 wk for both clinical endpoints. <b>Results:</b> Thirty-four patients (17 males; median age, 12.2 y; age range, 6.8-19.1 y) underwent PET imaging; 25 (74%) had localized disease. Primary tumor locations included the femur (<i>n</i> = 17; 50%), tibia (<i>n</i> = 9; 26%), and humerus (<i>n</i> = 5; 15%). Logistic regression showed that SUV<sub>max</sub> at 5 wk (<i>P</i> = 0.034) and 10 wk (<i>P</i> = 0.022) and percentage change from baseline at 10 wk (<i>P</i> = 0.021) were highly predictive of a histologic response. Using SUV<sub>max</sub> of 4.04 at week 5, SUV<sub>max</sub> of 3.15 at week 10, and 60% decrease from baseline at week 10 as cutoff values, we determined that the respective sensitivities were 0.93, 0.93, and 0.79 and that the respective specificities were 0.53, 0.71, and 0.76. <b>Conclusion:</b> SUV<sub>max</sub> on routine images at 5 or 10 wk and percentage change in SUV<sub>max</sub> from baseline to week 10 were metabolic predictors of a histologic response in OS.

Extraskeletal Osteosarcoma: Outcomes and the Role of Chemotherapy.,American journal of clinical oncology,Am. J. Clin. Oncol.,2018-09-01,"Extraskeletal osteosarcoma (EO) is a malignant neoplasm that produces osteoid, bone, and chondroid material without direct attachment to bone or periosteum. Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment; the role of chemotherapy is not well defined. Therefore, we evaluated the impact of chemotherapy in the survival of patients with EO. All EO patients seen at Mayo Clinic between 1990 and 2014 were assessed. Forty-three patients were included after all archived pathology slides were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis of EO. Of 43 patients, 37 patients had localized disease and 6 patients had metastatic disease at diagnosis. Chemotherapy was used in 73% and 75% of patients, respectively. Chemotherapy was predominantly anthracycline based, and included platinum in 22 patients (84%).Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 50 months (95% confidence interval, 25-99), and 21 months (95% confidence interval, 13-not reached), respectively. There was a trend towards longer OS and PFS in patients who received chemotherapy. Those who received platinum-based therapy had remarkably prolonged OS (median, 182 vs. 18 mo; 5-year, 61% vs. 0%; P=0.01) and PFS (median, not reached vs. 10 mo; 5-year, 56% vs. 0%; P=0.005). Baseline characteristics were similar in the platinum and nonplatinum group.In patients who received chemotherapy, relapse/recurrence rate was lower in the platinum-based group (41%) as opposed to the nonplatinum-based group (100%; P=0.02).

We conducted a phase II trial to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of combining bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against VEGF, with methotrexate, doxorubicin and cisplatin (MAP) in patients with localized osteosarcoma. Eligible patients received two courses of MAP chemotherapy before definitive surgery at week 10. Bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) was administered 3 days before starting chemotherapy then on day 1 of weeks 3 and 5 of chemotherapy. After surgery, patients received MAP for a total of 29 weeks; bevacizumab was added every 2 or 3 weeks on day 1 of chemotherapy at least 5 weeks after surgery. Group sequential monitoring rules were used to monitor for unacceptable bevacizumab-related targeted toxicity (grade 4 hypertension, proteinuria or bleeding, grade 3 or 4 thrombosis/embolism, and grade 2-4 major wound complications). Thirty-one patients (median age 12.8 years) with localized osteosarcoma were enrolled. No unacceptable targeted toxicities were observed except for wound complications (9 minor and 6 major), which occurred in 15 patients; none required removal of prosthetic hardware or amputation. The estimated 4-year event-free survival (EFS) rate and overall survival rate were 57.5 ± 10.0% and 83.4 ± 7.8%, respectively. Eight (28%) of 29 evaluable patients had good histologic response (<5% viable tumor) to preoperative chemotherapy.

J. Cancer,2017-09-08,"High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX)-based regimens are widely used in osteosarcoma. However, mandatory in-patient treatment with complex pharmacokinetic monitoring requirement precludes its use, especially in resource-constrained settings of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). All treatment naive consecutive patients of osteosarcoma were prospectively treated on a novel institutional regimen (named OGS-12) comprising of eight sequential doublets of the following drugs: doxorubicin, cisplatin and ifosfamide in four courses each, given in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. Data were prospectively collected on baseline characteristics, histological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), toxicity, event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Between 2011 and 2014, 317 treatment naive patients with extremity osteosarcoma were seen, of whom 237 (75%) were non-metastatic. Majority had high tumour burden, with mean tumour size of 10.45 cm, high serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) in 71% and 88% respectively. A significant number (34%) were nutritionally challenged. Two-hundred ten of 237 patients were analysable for histological response of which 58% had good response (viable cells ≤10%). At the median follow-up of 34.31 (2-60) months, in intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, the 5-year EFS and OS were 56% and 75% respectively; the same were 60% and 80% in per-protocol analysis. There was febrile neutropenia (FN) in 56%, grade 3/4 thrombocytopaenia in 22% and anaemia in 47% with two chemotoxic deaths. Ten percent of the patients had grade 3/4 diarrhoea and stomatitis and one patient developed grade 4 acute kidney injury requiring dialysis. Baseline SAP (per-protocol) for EFS and performance status (ITT) for OS were found to be independent variables. Histological response was an independent predictor for EFS and OS in both the analyses.

GRP78 inhibition enhances ATF4-induced cell death by the deubiquitination and stabilization of CHOP in human osteosarcoma.,Cancer letters,Cancer Lett.,2017-09-22,"New targeted therapies are urgently needed to improve the survival of patients with refractory osteosarcoma (OS). In this study, we show that bortezomib (BTZ), not for OS treatment in the clinic, induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in U-2 OS cells. Loss of GRP78 sensitizes OS to BTZ with concomitant upregulation of ATF4 and CHOP, which indicates excessive protein synthesis. The relevance of these findings is confirmed in vivo as shown by GRP78 knockdown that delays the growth of U-2 OS xenografts in the presence of BTZ. Here, we demonstrate that MG7, a natural polyyne, can trigger apoptosis. Of note, the apoptotic response to MG7 is dependent on ATF4 but not on the upstream PERK signaling pathway. Interestingly, MG7-induced ATF4 expression does not result in an increase in the levels of CHOP. We demonstrate for the first time that GRP78 physically interacts with the N-terminal domain of CHOP to accelerate its ubiquitination in a p300-dependent manner, which in turn desensitize the tumors to ER stress.

"Pembrolizumab in advanced soft-tissue sarcoma and bone sarcoma (SARC028): a multicentre, two-cohort, single-arm, open-label, phase 2 trial.",The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2017-10-04,"Patients with advanced sarcomas have a poor prognosis and few treatment options that improve overall survival. Chemotherapy and targeted therapies offer short-lived disease control. We assessed pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, for safety and activity in patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma or bone sarcoma. In this two-cohort, single-arm, open-label, phase 2 study, we enrolled patients with soft-tissue sarcoma or bone sarcoma from 12 academic centres in the USA that were members of the Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration (SARC). Patients with soft-tissue sarcoma had to be aged 18 years or older to enrol; patients with bone sarcoma could enrol if they were aged 12 years or older. Patients had histological evidence of metastatic or surgically unresectable locally advanced sarcoma, had received up to three previous lines of systemic anticancer therapy, had at least one measurable lesion according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1, and had at least one lesion accessible for biopsy. All patients were treated with 200 mg intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response. Patients who received at least one dose of pembrolizumab were included in the safety analysis and patients who progressed or reached at least one scan assessment were included in the activity analysis. Accrual is ongoing in some disease cohorts. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02301039. Between March 13, 2015, and Feb 18, 2016, we enrolled 86 patients, 84 of whom received pembrolizumab (42 in each disease cohort) and 80 of whom were evaluable for response (40 in each disease cohort). Median follow-up was 17·8 months (IQR 12·3-19·3). Seven (18%) of 40 patients with soft-tissue sarcoma had an objective response, including four (40%) of ten patients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, two (20%) of ten patients with liposarcoma, and one (10%) of ten patients with synovial sarcoma. No patients with leiomyosarcoma (n=10) had an objective response. Two (5%) of 40 patients with bone sarcoma had an objective response, including one (5%) of 22 patients with osteosarcoma and one (20%) of five patients with chondrosarcoma. None of the 13 patients with Ewing's sarcoma had an objective response. The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events were anaemia (six [14%]), decreased lymphocyte count (five [12%]), prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (four [10%]), and decreased platelet count (three [7%]) in the bone sarcoma group, and anaemia, decreased lymphocyte count, and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time in the soft-tissue sarcoma group (three [7%] each). Nine (11%) patients (five [12%] in the bone sarcoma group and four [10%] in the soft-tissue sarcoma group) had treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs), five of whom had immune-related SAEs, including two with adrenal insufficiency, two with pneumonitis, and one with nephritis. The primary endpoint of overall response was not met for either cohort. However, pembrolizumab showed encouraging activity in patients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma or dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Enrolment to expanded cohorts of those subtypes is ongoing to confirm and characterise the activity of pembrolizumab.

Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in osteosarcoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2017-12-18,"In osteosarcoma, patient survival has not changed in over 30 years. Multiple phase II trials have been conducted in osteosarcoma using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) as a primary endpoint; however, none of these have revealed new treatment strategies. We investigated RECIST in newly diagnosed patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy proven to be beneficial. Patients treated from 1986 to 2011 for newly diagnosed osteosarcoma with paired tumor imaging before and after adequate neoadjuvant chemotherapy were included in this retrospective study. Two radiologists performed independent, blinded (to image timing) RECIST measurements of primary tumor and lung metastases at diagnosis and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Association between RECIST and histological necrosis and outcome were assessed. Seventy-four patients met inclusion criteria. Five-year overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) were 77 ± 7% and 61 ± 8%, respectively. No patients had RECIST partial or complete response in the primary tumor. Sixty-four patients (86%) had stable disease, and 10 (14%) had progressive disease (PD). PD in the primary tumor was associated with significantly worse PFS in localized disease patients (P = 0.02). There was no association between RECIST in the primary tumor and necrosis. There were an insufficient number of patients with lung nodules ≥1 cm at diagnosis to evaluate RECIST in pulmonary metastases. PD by RECIST predicts poor outcome in localized disease patients.

Characteristics and outcomes of patients with advanced sarcoma enrolled in early phase immunotherapy trials.,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,J Immunother Cancer,2017-12-19,"Immunotherapies, specifically those based on immune checkpoint inhibitors, have shown promising activity in multiple tumor types. Other than mifamurtide (MEPACT®) for osteosarcoma approved by European Medicines Agency, there are no approved immunotherapies for sarcomas. We analyzed medical records of patients with advanced sarcoma who were referred to Phase 1 clinic at MD Anderson and received an immunotherapy (checkpoint inhibitors, vaccines, or cytokine based therapies). Clinical parameters including demographics, clinical history, toxicity, and response were abstracted. Among 50 patients enrolled in immunotherapy trials (Bone 10; Soft-tissue 40) we found 14 different subtypes of sarcomas. Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) prognostic score was <2 (86%). Performance status (PS) was 0-1 in 48 patients (96%); median number of prior therapies was 3 (0-12). Immunotherapy consisted of checkpoint inhibitors (82%: PD1 = 7, PD-L1 = 11, CTLA4 = 22, other = 1) of which 42% were combinations, as well as vaccines (14%), and cytokines (4%). Median overall survival (OS) was 13.4 months (11.2 months: not reached). Median progression free survival (PFS) was 2.4 months (95% CI = 1.9-3.2 months). Best response was partial response (PR) in 2 patients with alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) and stable disease (SD) in 11 patients (3 GIST, 3 liposarcomas (2 DDLS, 1 WDLS), 2 ASPS, 2 leiomyo, 1 osteo). PFS was 34% (23%, at 50%) at 3 months, 16% (8%, 30%) at 6 months, and 6% (2%, 20%) at 1 year. Pseudo-progression followed by stable disease was observed in 2 patients (4%).

Radiotherapy enhances natural killer cell cytotoxicity and localization in pre-clinical canine sarcomas and first-in-dog clinical trial.,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,J Immunother Cancer,2017-12-19,"We have previously shown that radiotherapy (RT) augments natural killer (NK) functions in pre-clinical models of human and mouse cancers, including sarcomas. Since dogs are an excellent outbred model for immunotherapy studies, we sought to assess RT plus local autologous NK transfer in canine sarcomas. Dog NK cells (CD5<sup>dim</sup>, NKp46+) were isolated from PBMCs and expanded with irradiated K562-C9-mIL21 feeder cells and 100 IU/mL recombinant human IL-2. NK homing and cytotoxicity ± RT were evaluated using canine osteosarcoma tumor lines and dog patient-derived xenografts (PDX). In a first-in-dog clinical trial for spontaneous osteosarcoma, we evaluated RT and intra-tumoral autologous NK transfer. After 14 days, mean NK expansion and yield were 19.0-fold (±8.6) and 258.9(±76.1) ×10<sup>6</sup> cells, respectively. Post-RT, NK cytotoxicity increased in a dose-dependent fashion in vitro reaching ~ 80% at effector:target ratios of ≥10:1 (P < 0.001). In dog PDX models, allogeneic NK cells were cytotoxic in ex vivo killing assays and produced significant PDX tumor growth delay (P < 0.01) in vivo. After focal RT and intravenous NK transfer, we also observed significantly increased NK homing to tumors in vivo. Of 10 dogs with spontaneous osteosarcoma treated with focal RT and autologous NK transfer, 5 remain metastasis-free at the 6-month primary endpoint with resolution of suspicious pulmonary nodules in one patient. We also observed increased activation of circulating NK cells after treatment and persistence of labelled NK cells in vivo.

Prognostic Value of Metabolic and Volumetric Parameters of FDG PET in Pediatric Osteosarcoma: A Hypothesis-generating Study.,Radiology,Radiology,2018-01-19,"Purpose To preliminarily assess the potential prognostic value of various fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) parameters before, during, and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT). Materials and Methods Thirty-four patients with osteosarcoma were enrolled prospectively from 2008 to 2012 and underwent FDG PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging before (baseline scan), during (interim scan) and after NCT (posttherapy scan). The study was approved by the institutional review board and informed consent was received from patients. Maximum and peak standardized uptake value (SUV<sub>max</sub> and SUV<sub>peak</sub>), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were measured. Predictive value of FDG PET parameters for event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. Multivariable Cox regression analysis for EFS and OS was performed by using histologic response and initial presence of metastasis as covariates. Results At baseline scan, SUV<sub>peak</sub>, MTV, and TLG were predictive of EFS (P = .006-.03) and OS (P = .001-.03) but not associated with histologic response. At interim and posttherapy scan, SUV<sub>max</sub>, SUV<sub>peak</sub>, MTV, and TLG were associated with histologic response (P = .0002-.04) and predictive of EFS (P = .004-.02) and OS (P = .001-.03). Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that the FDG PET parameters either at baseline, interim, or posttherapy were independently predictive of EFS and OS. In particular, baseline MTV was an independent predictor of EFS (hazard ratio, 5.0 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 1.5, 16.8]) and OS (hazard ratio, 29.4 [95% CI: 2.2, 392.2]).

Patients with a primary diagnosis of connective tissue malignancy between 1973 and 2008 in the SEER database were included. Multivariable competing risk analysis was used to determine risk factors associated with subsequent development of acute leukemia. Using observed-to-expected ratios, we compared incidence rates of secondary acute leukemia between sarcoma patients and the general population. A total of 72,945 patients were identified, with median follow-up of 131 months. On multivariable competing risk analysis, factors associated with increased risk of secondary acute leukemia included receipt of radiation therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 1.67, P=.02), distant disease (HR 2.67, P=.004), male gender (HR 1.53, P=.03), year of diagnosis (HR 0.98, P=.049), and Ewing sarcoma histology (HR 9.95, P < .0001) and osteosarcoma histology (HR 5.06, P=.0001). The observed-to-expected ratio for development of a secondary acute leukemia was 3.67 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.95-6.28), 3.41 (95% CI 2.73-4.20), and 1.6 (95% CI 1.38-8.19) for acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and acute monocytic leukemia, respectively. The 10-year cumulative incidence of secondary acute leukemia for patients who did and did receive radiation therapy was 0.3% versus 0.1% (P=.02). Patients treated for sarcoma, in particular those with Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma histology, seem to have a higher incidence of secondary acute leukemia as compared with the general population. Treatment factors including radiation therapy and chemotherapy seem to play a role in this increased risk, although the absolute incidence nevertheless remains very small.",Journal Article,798.0,1.0,"To compare rates of secondary acute between patients and the general population using data from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER registry and to examine whether various patient tumor and treatment factors were associated with development of a secondary acute Patients with a primary diagnosis of connective tissue malignancy between 1973 and 2008 in the SEER database were included Multivariable competing risk analysis was used to determine risk factors associated with subsequent development of acute Using observed-to-expected ratios we compared incidence rates of secondary acute between patients and the general population A total of 72,945 patients were identified with median follow-up of 131 months On multivariable competing risk analysis factors associated with increased risk of secondary acute included receipt of radiation therapy hazard ratio HR 1.67 P=.02 distant disease HR 2.67 P=.004 male gender HR 1.53 P=.03 year of diagnosis HR 0.98 P=.049 and histology HR 9.95 P .0001 and histology HR 5.06 P=.0001 The observed-to-expected ratio for development of a secondary acute was 3.67 95 confidence interval CI 1.95-6.28 3.41 95 CI 2.73-4.20 and 1.6 95 CI 1.38-8.19 for acute lymphocytic acute myeloid and acute monocytic respectively The 10-year cumulative incidence of secondary acute for patients who did and did receive radiation therapy was 0.3 versus 0.1 P=.02 Patients treated for in particular those with and histology seem to have a higher incidence of secondary acute as compared with the general population Treatment factors including radiation therapy and chemotherapy seem to play a role in this increased risk although the absolute incidence nevertheless remains very small",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 932, 151, 1, 568, 286, 59, 7, 2, 3, 1083, 266, 75, 74, 29, 3, 657, 12, 1377, 617, 1284, 2, 396, 99, 1605, 1608, 2, 6, 1004, 317, 747, 69, 30, 2, 24, 130, 11, 41, 5, 193, 1, 8, 568, 286, 7, 5, 8, 86, 147, 1, 10990, 246, 710, 59, 4756, 2, 1375, 4, 3, 1605, 609, 11, 159, 658, 2573, 43, 65, 10, 95, 6, 223, 43, 130, 41, 5, 706, 193, 1, 286, 75, 164, 6, 1336, 1137, 21, 72, 287, 151, 1, 568, 286, 59, 7, 2, 3, 1083, 266, 8, 181, 1, 720, 14928, 7, 11, 108, 5, 52, 166, 126, 1, 2229, 53, 23, 658, 2573, 43, 65, 130, 41, 5, 101, 43, 1, 568, 286, 159, 1699, 1, 121, 36, 360, 197, 168, 14, 598, 19, 588, 626, 34, 168, 18, 598, 19, 1520, 1045, 1632, 168, 14, 699, 19, 680, 111, 1, 147, 168, 13, 1096, 19, 5121, 2, 784, 168, 83, 48, 19, 488, 2, 784, 168, 33, 1460, 19, 488, 3, 164, 6, 1336, 197, 9, 193, 1, 8, 568, 286, 10, 27, 598, 48, 307, 268, 58, 14, 48, 49, 339, 27, 605, 48, 58, 18, 803, 39, 179, 2, 14, 49, 48, 58, 14, 519, 66, 326, 9, 286, 1193, 286, 533, 2, 286, 9003, 106, 3, 79, 111, 967, 287, 1, 568, 286, 9, 7, 54, 205, 2, 205, 560, 121, 36, 10, 13, 27, 185, 13, 14, 19, 588, 7, 73, 9, 4, 1454, 135, 5, 2, 784, 3233, 6, 47, 8, 142, 287, 1, 568, 286, 22, 72, 5, 3, 1083, 266, 24, 130, 141, 121, 36, 2, 56, 3233, 6, 1343, 8, 200, 4, 26, 101, 43, 242, 3, 1766, 287, 3873, 469, 923, 302]",1744.0,29413281,115
Primary Osteosarcoma in the Elderly Revisited: Current Concepts in Diagnosis and Treatment.,Current oncology reports,Curr Oncol Rep,2018-02-28,"Osteosarcoma is mostly seen in bones of children and young adults. When it occurs in older persons, the tumor is considered secondary usually complicating Paget disease or irradiated bone. However, there is a second incidence peak of primary osteosarcoma later in life when these tumors occur de novo. This article describes the clinical, imaging, and treatment of POS in older patients, including demographic data of patients from our institution. We present our experience with 920 cases of osteosarcoma that were seen between 1984 and 2003 at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, TX, USA. Among the 868 primary osteosarcoma of bones, there were 100 (11.52%), which comprised 69% of the tumors in patients over the age of 50 years. Older patients with primary osteosarcoma tend to have relatively more common axial skeleton involvement, have more distant disease, and are difficult to treat because of concomitant comorbidities. Despite that, most adult patients treated with chemotherapy have shown good results with longer disease-free survival. A lytic bone lesion seen in radiographs of elderly patients should include primary osteosarcoma among differential diagnoses. Radical surgery and chemotherapy seem to ensure long-term disease-free survival in most cases.

Analysis of HSP27 and the Autophagy Marker LC3B<sup>+</sup> Puncta Following Preoperative Chemotherapy Identifies High-Risk Osteosarcoma Patients.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2018-03-28,"Chemotherapy-induced autophagy is a proposed mechanism of chemoresistance and potential therapeutic target in osteosarcoma. We evaluated heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) and autophagy-related proteins as predictors of pathologic treatment response and prognostic markers among osteosarcoma patients who received standard chemotherapy. We analyzed 394 tumor specimens (pre-treatment, post-treatment, and metastases) from 260 osteosarcoma patients by immunohistochemistry for cytoplasmic light chain 3B (LC3B)-positive puncta, sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1), high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and HSP27 expression. The staining percentage and intensity for each marker were scored and the extent to which marker expression was correlated with pathologic response, relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) was assessed. LCB3<sup>+</sup> puncta in post-treatment primary tumors (50%) and metastases (67%) was significantly higher than in pre-treatment biopsy specimens (30%; <i>P</i> = 0.023 and <0.001).

Academic Facility Utilization and Survival Outcomes in Adult Head and Neck Sarcomas: An NCDB Analysis.,Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,2018-04-17,"Objectives To investigate clinicopathologic and treatment factors associated with survival in adult head and neck sarcomas in the National Cancer Database (NCDB). To analyze whether treatment settings and therapies received influence survival outcomes and to compare trends in utilization via an aggregated national data set. Study Design Prospectively gathered data. Setting NCDB. Subjects and Methods The study comprised a total of 6944 adult patients treated for a head and neck sarcoma from January 2004 to December 2013. Overall survival (OS) was the primary outcome. Results Increased age and tumor size, nodal involvement, and poorly differentiated histology had significantly reduced OS ( P < .001). Angiosarcoma, malignant nerve sheath tumor, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, osteosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma histologic subtypes had significantly reduced OS, while liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, and chordoma had improved OS ( P < .001). Utilization of surgical therapy was associated with improved OS, while positive surgical margins were associated with treatment at a community-based cancer program and had reduced OS ( P < .001). On multivariate analysis, treatment with radiation and/or chemotherapy was not significantly associated with OS; however, primary treatment with definitive chemoradiotherapy had significantly reduced OS.

CRISPR-Cas9-Mediated Silencing of CD44 in Human Highly Metastatic Osteosarcoma Cells.,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",Cell. Physiol. Biochem.,2018-04-16,"Metastasis is the major cause of death in patients with osteosarcoma. There is an urgent need to identify molecular markers that promote metastasis. Cluster of differentiation 44 is a receptor for hyaluronic acid (HA) and HA-binding has been proven to participate in various biological tumor activities, including tumor progression and metastasis. We performed a meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between CD44 expression, survival, and metastasis in patients with osteosarcoma. We then utilized the CRISPR-Cas9 system to specifically silence CD44 in highly metastatic human osteosarcoma cells (MNNG/HOS and 143B) and further determined the functional effects of CD44 knockout in these cells. The meta-analysis demonstrated that a high level of CD44 may predict poor survival and higher potential of metastasis in patients with osteosarcoma. The expression of CD44 in highly metastatic human osteosarcoma cell lines was efficiently blocked by CRISPR-Cas9. When CD44 was silenced, the proliferation and spheroid formation of these osteosarcoma cells was inhibited under 3-D culture conditions. Furthermore, the migratory and invasive functions were also impaired in these highly metastatic osteosarcoma cells.

Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis of 67 osteosarcoma and age-matched non-diseased control sera showed that sFPR3 protein levels were significantly lower in osteosarcoma than in normal. Analysis of tumor and adjacent normal tissues (9 pairs) from osteosarcoma patients showed a decrease in sFRP3 expression in 5 out of 9 tumor samples compared to normal tissues. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarray revealed a significant decrease in sFRP3 levels in tumor compared to normal bone.

A complete or partial response was observed in 63 (60.6%) of lesions, and stable disease was observed in 34 (32.7%). At a median follow-up of 8.7 months, 21 local failures occurred (20.2%). The 1- and 2-year LC rates were 74% and 68%, respectively. LC was better for tumors without previous irradiation (83% vs 57% with previous RT; P = .004). LC rates did not differ between RT techniques or total biologically effective dose with α/β ratio of 10 (BED10) (≤30 vs >30 Gy). At the time of analysis, 38 deaths in the cohort of 62 patients (61.3%) were recorded. The 1-year progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 31% and 44%, respectively.

Detection of circulating tumour DNA is associated with inferior outcomes in Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.,British journal of cancer,Br. J. Cancer,2018-08-21,"New prognostic markers are needed to identify patients with Ewing sarcoma (EWS) and osteosarcoma unlikely to benefit from standard therapy. We describe the incidence and association with outcome of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) assays. A NGS hybrid capture assay and an ultra-low-pass whole-genome sequencing assay were used to detect ctDNA in banked plasma from patients with EWS and osteosarcoma, respectively. Patients were coded as positive or negative for ctDNA and tested for association with clinical features and outcome. The analytic cohort included 94 patients with EWS (82% from initial diagnosis) and 72 patients with primary localised osteosarcoma (100% from initial diagnosis). ctDNA was detectable in 53% and 57% of newly diagnosed patients with EWS and osteosarcoma, respectively. Among patients with newly diagnosed localised EWS, detectable ctDNA was associated with inferior 3-year event-free survival (48.6% vs. 82.1%; p = 0.006) and overall survival (79.8% vs. 92.6%; p = 0.01).

Association of macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration with outcome in canine osteosarcoma.,Veterinary and comparative oncology,Vet Comp Oncol,2018-09-19,"Immunotherapeutic strategies have shown promise for the treatment of canine osteosarcoma (cOSA). Very little is known about the immune microenvironment within cOSA, however, limiting our ability to identify potential immune targets and biomarkers of therapeutic response. We therefore prospectively assessed the disease-free interval (DFI) and overall survival time (ST) of 30 dogs with cOSA treated with amputation and six doses of adjuvant carboplatin. We then quantified lymphocytic (CD3+, FOXP3+) and macrophage (CD204+) infiltrates within the primary tumours of this cohort using immunohistochemistry, and evaluated their association with outcome. Overall, the median DFI and ST were 392 and 455 days, respectively. The median number of CD3+ and FOXP3+ infiltrates were 45.8 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> (4.6-607.6 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> ) and 8.5 mm<sup>2</sup> (0-163.1 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> ), respectively. The median area of CD204+ macrophages was 4.7% (1.3%-23.3%), and dogs with tumours containing greater than 4.7% CD204+ macrophages experienced a significantly longer DFI (P = 0.016). Interestingly, a significantly lower percentage of CD204+ macrophages was detected in cOSA arising from the proximal humerus compared to other appendicular bone locations (P = 0.016). Lymphocytic infiltrates did not appear to correlate with outcome in cOSA.

Characteristics and Predictors for Secondary Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome in Ewing and Osteosarcoma Survivors.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2018-08-28,"Long-term survivors of Ewing sarcoma (ES) and osteosarcoma may be at risk for therapy-related acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (t-AL/MDS). We retrospectively reviewed the clinicopathologic characteristics of 1071 patients with osteosarcoma (n = 757) and ES (n = 314) who were treated between 1985 and 2014. Multivariable competing risk analysis was used to analyze predictors of t-AL/MDS, including a radiation dose (≥55.8 Gy vs <55.8 Gy) × disease site (pelvis/spine vs other) interaction term. A supplemental nested case-control study was conducted to assess the association between cumulative chemotherapy dose and t-AL/MDS. The median follow-up for surviving patients was 97 months (range, 0.03-380). Twenty patients developed t-AL/MDS, all of whom received chemotherapy and 15 of whom were treated with radiation therapy. Radiation therapy to ≥55.8 Gy was associated with development of t-AL/MDS (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-6.80; P = .015), and there was a significant radiation dose × disease site interaction term (adjusted hazard ratio, 6.70; 95% CI, 2.71-16.53; P<sub>interaction</sub> < .001). The 5-year cumulative incidence of t-AL/MDS in patients receiving ≥55.8 Gy radiation therapy to the pelvis or spine was 5.0% (95% CI, 0.9-14.9) for osteosarcoma and 10.7% for ES (95% CI, 3.3-23.2).

Assessing the feasibility and validity of the Toronto Childhood Cancer Stage Guidelines: a population-based registry study.,The Lancet. Child & adolescent health,Lancet Child Adolesc Health,2018-02-01,"Cancer stage at diagnosis is crucial for assessing global efforts to increase awareness of childhood cancer and improve outcomes. However, consistent information on childhood cancer stage is absent from population cancer registries worldwide. The Toronto Childhood Cancer Stage Guidelines, compiled through an international consensus process, were designed to provide a standard framework for collection of information on stage at diagnosis of childhood cancers. We aimed to assess the feasibility of implementing the Toronto Guidelines within a national population cancer registry. We did a population-based registry study using data from the Australian Childhood Cancer Registry and included data from children aged 0-14 years diagnosed between Jan 1, 2006, and Dec 31, 2010 with one of 16 childhood cancers listed in the Toronto Guidelines (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumour, rhabdomyosarcoma, non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, retinoblastoma, hepatoblastoma, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, medulloblastoma, and ependymoma). We extracted data from medical records, and assigned stage according to the Tier 1 criteria (basic) and Tier 2 criteria (more detailed, requiring data from cytology, imaging, and other diagnostic tests, where available) using computer algorithms derived from the Toronto Guidelines. Additionally, expert reviewers independently assigned Tier 2 stage to a random subsample of 160 cases (ten per malignancy type). Feasibility of the guidelines was assessed on the percentage of cases that could be staged, agreement between stage assigned by the algorithms and the expert reviewers, and the mean time (min) taken to collect the required data. We obtained data for 1412 eligible children. Stage could be assigned according to Tier 2 criteria for 1318 (93%) cases, ranging from 48 (84%) of 57 cases of non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma to 46 (100%) cases of hepatoblastoma. According to Tier 1 criteria, stage could be assigned for 1329 (94%) cases, ranging from 131 (87%) of 151 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia to 46 (100%) cases of hepatoblastoma. By contrast, stage at diagnosis was recorded by the treating physician for 555 (39%) of the 1412 cases. The computer algorithm assigned the same stage as did one or more independent expert reviewers in 155 (97%) of the 160 cases assessed. The mean time taken to review medical records and extract the required data was 18·0 min (SD 9·5 per case). The Toronto Guidelines provide a highly functional framework that can be used to assign cancer stage at diagnosis using data routinely available in medical records for most childhood cancers. Data on staging have the potential to inform interventions targeting improved diagnosis and survival.

Patients with newly diagnosed, localized osteosarcoma and their parents completed three HRQOL instruments (PedsQL v.4, PedsQL Cancer v.3, and Symptom Distress Scale [SDS]). Data were collected at four time points throughout therapy. Repeated measures models were used to investigate the effect of treatment site on instrument scores. The log-rank test examined the impact of treatment site on survival outcomes, and Cox proportional hazards regression models evaluated baseline HRQOL measures as predictors of EFS and OS.

"Outcomes in Treatment-Naïve Patients With Metastatic Extremity Osteosarcoma Treated With OGS-12, a Novel Non-High-Dose Methotrexate-Based, Dose-Dense Combination Chemotherapy, in a Tertiary Care Cancer Center.",Journal of global oncology,J Glob Oncol,2018-09-01,"Metastatic osteosarcoma is largely treated with high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX)-based therapy, especially in the pediatric population. This mandates complex pharmacokinetic monitoring in a costly inpatient setting to mitigate unpredictable serious toxicities. Hence, a non-HDMTX-based regimen is worth exploring, especially in India and low- and middle-income countries. All consecutive treatment-naïve patients with metastatic osteosarcoma were prospectively treated on the novel OGS-12 protocol consisting of sequential doublets of doxorubicin, cisplatin, and ifosfamide. Four cycles were administered as neoadjuvant therapy followed by planned curative intent surgery and metastasectomy when feasible, followed by four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. Baseline characteristics, histologic response, event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity data were prospectively collected. Three hundred seventeen patients were enrolled onto the OGS-12 protocol from 2011 to 2014, of whom 80 (25%) had metastatic disease; median age was 17 years. The majority of patients were nutritionally challenged with high-risk features. At presentation, 83% of patients (66 patients) had lung metastases. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 57% of patients were histologically good responders. Four-year EFS and OS rates were 24% and 27%, respectively, in the intent-to-treat population and 27% and 29%, respectively, in the per-protocol analysis. Significant grade 3 or 4 toxicities were febrile neutropenia (51%), thrombocytopenia (36%), and anemia (54%).

Factors influencing survival after recurrence in osteosarcoma: A report from the Children's Oncology Group.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2018-09-25,"Despite drastic improvement in overall survival for pediatric patients with cancer, those with osteosarcoma have stable rates of survival since the 1980s. This project evaluates the effect of several variables on survival after first recurrence in patients with osteosarcoma. Data from three prospective North American cooperative group trials for newly diagnosed osteosarcoma are included: INT-0133, POG-9754, and AOST0121. The analytic population for this study is all enrolled patients with first event-free survival (EFS) event of relapse. The primary outcome measure for this retrospective analysis was survival after recurrence (SAR). The analytic population consisted of N = 431 patients. SAR was statistically significantly associated with age at enrollment (<10 years, P = 0.027), presence of metastatic disease at diagnosis (localized, P < 0.0001), site of relapse (combination lung + bone, unfavorable, P = 0.005), and time to first relapse (2+ years, favorable, P < 0.0001) in multivariate analysis. Ethnicity, primary site of tumor, race, and sex were not significantly related to SAR. Prolonged SAR in patients with relapsed osteosarcoma is associated with age, extent of disease at diagnosis, site of and time to relapse. Adolescent and young adult patients with osteosarcoma have shorter SAR than younger patients, consistent with studies showing decreased overall survival in this group. Although patients with primary metastatic disease have shorter SAR, there is a subset of patients who relapse greater than 2 years from initial diagnosis that will become survivors.

Inhibition of STAT3 blocks protein synthesis and tumor metastasis in osteosarcoma cells.,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res.,2018-10-04,"Osteosarcoma is the most common bone cancer. Despite advances, molecular mechanisms associated with osteosarcoma have not been fully understood. Hence, an effective treatment for osteosarcoma has yet to be developed. Even though signal transducer and activator of transcription3 (STAT3) has been implicated, its role in pathogenesis of osteosarcoma is not fully determined. In this study, we investigated the antitumor effect of napabucasin (NP) (BBI608), an inhibitor of STAT3 on osteosarcoma in vitro and in vivo and studied the underlying molecular mechanism. Cell viability, colony formation, apoptosis, tumor growth and metastasis assays were performed to examine the effect of NP on osteosarcoma in vitro and in vivo. Real-time RT-PCR, western analysis, immunofluorescence and reporter assays were used to monitor the expression and activity of proteins and underlying molecular pathways. Protein synthesis, co-immunoprecipitation and CAP binding assays were carried out to understand NP-mediated mechanism of actions in osteosarcoma cells. Our results show that NP treatment decreases cell viability and induces apoptosis in several osteosarcoma cell lines. NP treatment suppresses both expression and phosphorylation of STAT3 in addition to blocking STAT3-mediated transcription and downstream target proteins in osteosarcoma cells. Furthermore, NP inhibits protein synthesis through regulation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). NP also inhibits the progression of osteosarcoma tumors and metastasis in vivo in an orthotopic tibial model of osteosarcoma. Taken together, our investigation reveals that NP acts through a novel mechanism and inhibits osteosarcoma growth and metastasis, and could be investigated clinically for treating osteosarcoma patients alone or in combination with other drugs.",Journal Article,474.0,8.0,is the most common cancer Despite advances molecular mechanisms associated with have not been fully understood Hence an effective treatment for has yet to be developed Even though signal transducer and activator of transcription3 STAT3 has been implicated its role in pathogenesis of is not fully determined In this study we investigated the antitumor effect of napabucasin NP BBI608 an inhibitor of STAT3 on in vitro and in vivo and studied the underlying molecular mechanism Cell viability colony formation apoptosis tumor growth and metastasis assays were performed to examine the effect of NP on in vitro and in vivo Real-time RT-PCR western analysis immunofluorescence and reporter assays were used to monitor the expression and activity of proteins and underlying molecular pathways Protein synthesis co-immunoprecipitation and CAP binding assays were carried out to understand NP-mediated mechanism of actions in cells Our results show that NP treatment decreases cell viability and induces apoptosis in several cell lines NP treatment suppresses both expression and phosphorylation of STAT3 in addition to blocking STAT3-mediated transcription and downstream target proteins in cells Furthermore NP inhibits protein synthesis through regulation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E eIF4E and eIF4E-binding protein 1 4E-BP1 NP also inhibits the progression of tumors and metastasis in vivo in an orthotopic tibial model of Taken together our investigation reveals that NP acts through a novel mechanism and inhibits growth and metastasis and could be investigated clinically for treating patients alone or in combination with other drugs,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[16, 3, 96, 186, 12, 550, 954, 219, 483, 41, 5, 47, 44, 85, 1910, 1784, 3665, 35, 323, 24, 9, 71, 1145, 6, 40, 276, 871, 2471, 1235, 5182, 2, 3393, 1, 73729, 1439, 71, 85, 1771, 211, 200, 4, 1384, 1, 16, 44, 1910, 509, 4, 26, 45, 21, 565, 3, 579, 254, 1, 73730, 3769, 73731, 35, 230, 1, 1439, 23, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 2, 656, 3, 1181, 219, 670, 31, 2120, 1975, 1264, 351, 30, 129, 2, 278, 1013, 11, 173, 6, 1004, 3, 254, 1, 3769, 23, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 1589, 98, 240, 604, 1521, 65, 4130, 2, 3674, 1013, 11, 95, 6, 3334, 3, 55, 2, 128, 1, 652, 2, 1181, 219, 460, 178, 2525, 1269, 4857, 2, 3204, 791, 1013, 11, 2629, 1205, 6, 1640, 3769, 517, 670, 1, 5592, 4, 37, 114, 99, 514, 17, 3769, 24, 2140, 31, 2120, 2, 1516, 351, 4, 392, 31, 285, 3769, 24, 4079, 110, 55, 2, 982, 1, 1439, 4, 352, 6, 2521, 1439, 517, 866, 2, 1489, 283, 652, 4, 37, 798, 3769, 1576, 178, 2525, 298, 863, 1, 3, 8374, 1118, 161, 6726, 6916, 2, 6916, 791, 178, 14, 6726, 7949, 3769, 120, 1576, 3, 91, 1, 57, 2, 278, 4, 386, 4, 35, 2157, 26051, 202, 1, 1633, 1162, 114, 940, 4054, 17, 3769, 4459, 298, 8, 229, 670, 2, 1576, 129, 2, 278, 2, 359, 40, 565, 505, 9, 1367, 7, 279, 15, 4, 150, 5, 127, 600]",1646.0,30286779,153

A phase II study of eribulin in recurrent or refractory osteosarcoma: A report from the Children's Oncology Group.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2018-10-30,"Patients with recurrent or refractory osteosarcoma have a poor prognosis with less than 30% surviving two years. Eribulin is a synthetic analog of halichondrin B, has a novel mechanism of action when compared with other microtubule inhibitors, and may have antitumor activity in osteosarcoma. A prospective study was designed to assess the disease control success at four months and objective response rates in patients with recurrent or refractory osteosarcoma treated with eribulin. Eligible patients were between 12 and 50 years of age, had measurable tumor, and met standard organ function requirements. Patients were given eribulin 1.4 mg/m<sup>2</sup> /dose on days 1 and 8 of each 3-week cycle for up to 24 months if there was no progressive disease. Response to therapy was assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria after cycles 2 and 5 and every fourth cycle thereafter. Nineteen patients enrolled on the AOST1322 study. The median age of enrollment was 16 years (range, 12-25 years). Twelve patients were male and seven female. Eribulin was well tolerated, with neutropenia identified as the most common toxicity.

We developed orthotopic patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) that recapitulated the molecular, cellular and histologic features of primary tumors, and screened PDX-expanded short-term cultures and commercial cell lines of osteosarcoma against focused drug libraries. Osteosarcoma cells were most sensitive to HDAC, proteasome, and combination PI3K/MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, and least sensitive to PARP, RAF, ERK and MEK inhibitors. Correspondingly, PI3K signaling pathway genes were up-regulated in metastatic tumors compared to primary tumors. In combinatorial screens, as a class, HDAC inhibitors showed additive effects when combined with standard-of-care agents gemcitabine and doxorubicin.

Temporal patterns in the risk of chronic health conditions in survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed 1970-99: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort.,The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2018-11-08,"Treatments for childhood cancer have evolved over the past 50 years, with the goal of maximising the proportion of patients who achieve long-term survival, while minimising the adverse effects of therapy. We aimed to assess incidence patterns of serious chronic health conditions in long-term survivors of childhood cancer across three decades of diagnosis and treatment. We used data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, a retrospective cohort with longitudinal follow-up of 5-year survivors of common childhood cancers (leukaemia, tumours of the CNS, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Wilms tumour, neuroblastoma, soft tissue sarcoma, or bone tumours) who were diagnosed before the age of 21 years and from 1970 to 1999 in North America. We examined the cumulative incidence of severe to fatal chronic health conditions occurring up to 20 years post-diagnosis among survivors, compared by diagnosis decade. We used multivariable regression models to estimate hazard ratios per diagnosis decade, and we added treatment variables to assess whether treatment changes attenuated associations between diagnosis decade and chronic disease risk. Among 23 601 survivors with a median follow-up of 21 years (IQR 15-25), the 20-year cumulative incidence of at least one grade 3-5 chronic condition decreased significantly from 33·2% (95% CI 32·0-34·3) in those diagnosed 1970-79 to 29·3% (28·4-30·2; p<0·0001) in 1980-89, and 27·5% (26·4-28·6; p=0·012 vs 1980-89) in 1990-99. By comparison, the 20-year cumulative incidence of at least one grade 3-5 condition in 5051 siblings was 4·6% (95% CI 3·9-5·2). The 15-year cumulative incidence of at least one grade 3-5 condition was lower for survivors diagnosed 1990-99 compared with those diagnosed 1970-79 for Hodgkin lymphoma (17·7% [95% CI 15·0-20·5] vs 26·4% [23·8-29·1]; p<0·0001), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (16·9% [14·0-19·7] vs 23·8% [19·9-27·7]; p=0.0053), astrocytoma (30·5% [27·8-33·2] vs 47·3% [42·9-51·7]; p<0·0001), Wilms tumour (11·9% [9·5-14·3] vs 17·6% [14·3-20·8]; p=0·034), soft tissue sarcoma (28·3% [23·5-33·1] vs 36·5% [31·5-41·4]; p=0·021), and osteosarcoma (65·6% [60·6-70·6] vs 87·5% [84·1-91·0]; p<0·0001). By contrast, the 15-year cumulative incidence of at least one grade 3-5 condition was higher (1990-99 vs 1970-79) for medulloblastoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumour (58·9% [54·4-63·3] vs 42·9% [34·9-50·9]; p=0·00060), and neuroblastoma (25·0% [21·8-28·2] vs 18·0% [14·5-21·6]; p=0·0045). Results were consistent with changes in treatment as a significant mediator of the association between diagnosis decade and risk of grade 3-5 chronic conditions for astrocytoma (HR per decade without treatment in the model = 0·77, 95% CI 0·64-0·92; HR with treatment in the model=0·89, 95% CI 0·72-1·11; p<sub>mediation</sub>=0·0085) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HR without treatment=0·75, 95% CI 0·65-0·85; HR with treatment=0·91, 95% CI 0·73-1·12; p<sub>mediation</sub>=0·024). Temporal decreases in 15-year cumulative incidence comparing survivors diagnosed 1970-79 to survivors diagnosed 1990-99 were noted for endocrinopathies (5·9% [5·3-6·4] vs 2·8% [2·5-3·2]; p<0·0001), subsequent malignant neoplasms (2·7% [2·3-3·1] vs 1·9% [1·6-2·2]; p=0·0033), musculoskeletal conditions (5·8% [5·2-6·4] vs 3·3% [2·9-3·6]; p<0·0001), and gastrointestinal conditions (2·3% [2·0-2·7] vs 1·5% [1·3-1·8]; p=0·00037), while hearing loss increased (3·0% [2·6-3·5] vs 5·7% [5·2-6·1]; p<0·0001). Our results suggest that more recently treated survivors of childhood cancer had improvements in health outcomes, consistent with efforts over the same time period to modify childhood cancer treatment regimens to maximise overall survival, while reducing risk of long-term adverse events. Continuing advances in cancer therapy offer promise of further reducing the risk of long-term adverse events in childhood cancer survivors. However, achieving long-term survival for childhood cancer continues to come at a cost for many survivors, emphasising the importance of long-term follow-up care for this population.

Extraskeletal Osteosarcomas: A Case Made for Combined Modality Local Therapy With Radiation and Surgery.,American journal of clinical oncology,Am. J. Clin. Oncol.,2019-03-01,"We evaluated our experience treating patients with extraskeletal osteosarcoma (ESOS) using combined modality local therapy, including surgery and radiation therapy (RT), to investigate local control (LC) and other survival endpoints. We reviewed the records of 21 consecutive patients with nonmetastatic, ESOS treated with RT in combination with surgery at our institution from 1984 to 2015. Postoperative RT was used for 10 patients (48%) to a median dose of 60 Gy (range, 60 to 68 Gy). The other 11 patients (52%) received 50 Gy preoperatively. Seven patients (33%) were treated with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Among the patients who received chemotherapy, all were treated with doxorubicin and ifosfamide for a median of 6 cycles (range, 4 to 6). Median follow-up time was 120 months (range, 6 to 200 mo). Larger tumor size (>5 cm) was associated with chemotherapy use (P=0.046). The 5-year LC, distant metastatic free survival, and disease-specific survival rates were 93%, 53%, and 62%, respectively. Only 1 patient (5%) had a local recurrence at 22 months. Nine patients (43%) developed distant metastases at a median time of 9 months (range, 1 to 30 mo) without any significant factors for reduced distant metastatic free survival. Following disease relapse, there were 2 patients who were ultimately salvaged, both of whom were treated with chemotherapy and surgery.

The Clonal Evolution of Metastatic Osteosarcoma as Shaped by Cisplatin Treatment.,Molecular cancer research : MCR,Mol. Cancer Res.,2019-01-16,"To investigate the genomic evolution of metastatic pediatric osteosarcoma, we performed whole-genome and targeted deep sequencing on 14 osteosarcoma metastases and two primary tumors from four patients (two to eight samples per patient). All four patients harbored ancestral (truncal) somatic variants resulting in <i>TP53</i> inactivation and cell-cycle aberrations, followed by divergence into relapse-specific lineages exhibiting a cisplatin-induced mutation signature. In three of the four patients, the cisplatin signature accounted for >40% of mutations detected in the metastatic samples. Mutations potentially acquired during cisplatin treatment included <i>NF1</i> missense mutations of uncertain significance in two patients and a <i>KIT</i> G565R activating mutation in one patient. Three of four patients demonstrated widespread ploidy differences between samples from the sample patient. Single-cell seeding of metastasis was detected in most metastatic samples. Cross-seeding between metastatic sites was observed in one patient, whereas in another patient a minor clone from the primary tumor seeded both metastases analyzed. These results reveal extensive clonal heterogeneity in metastatic osteosarcoma, much of which is likely cisplatin-induced.

Stage at diagnosis for childhood solid cancers in Australia: A population-based study.,Cancer epidemiology,Cancer Epidemiol,2019-03-01,"Stage of cancer at diagnosis is one of the strongest predictors of survival and is essential for population cancer surveillance, comparison of cancer outcomes and to guide national cancer control strategies. Our aim was to describe, for the first time, the distribution of cases by stage at diagnosis and differences in stage-specific survival on a population basis for a range of childhood solid cancers in Australia. The study cohort was drawn from the population-based Australian Childhood Cancer Registry and comprised children (<15 years) diagnosed with one of 12 solid malignancies between 2006 and 2014. Stage at diagnosis was assigned according to the Toronto Paediatric Cancer Stage Guidelines. Observed (all cause) survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with follow-up on mortality available to 31 December 2015. Almost three-quarters (1256 of 1760 cases, 71%) of children in the study had localised or regional disease at diagnosis, varying from 43% for neuroblastoma to 99% for retinoblastoma.

MAT2B promotes proliferation and inhibits apoptosis in osteosarcoma by targeting epidermal growth factor receptor and proliferating cell nuclear antigen.,International journal of oncology,Int. J. Oncol.,2019-03-27,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most commonly diagnosed bone tumor in young people with poor prognosis. At present, the mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis in OS are not well understood. The methionine adnosyltransferase 2B (MAT2B) gene encodes the regulatory subunit of methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT). Recent studies demonstrated that it is highly expressed in a number of human malignancies; however, is undefined in OS. In the present study, MAT2B expression was investigated in tumor samples and cell lines. In vivo and in vitro, lentivirus‑mediated small hairpin RNA was constructed to target the MAT2B gene and examine the role of MAT2B in OS proliferation. Microarray analysis was performed to examine the possible downstream molecular target of MAT2B in OS. MAT2B was markedly increased in OS specimens compared with the normal bone tissues, and it was additionally abundantly expressed in OS cell lines. Inhibition of MAT2B expression caused a marked decrease in proliferation and significant increase in apoptosis. In vivo, MAT2B silencing significantly inhibited OS cell growth. Microarray analysis suggested that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) may function as downstream targets of MAT2B in OS, as confirmed by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays and western blotting. Collectively, these results suggested that MAT2B serves a critical role in the proliferation of OS by regulating EGFR and PCNA and that it may be a potential therapeutic target and prognostic factor of OS.",Journal Article,300.0,0.0,OS is the most commonly diagnosed tumor in young people with poor prognosis At present the mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis in OS are not well understood The methionine adnosyltransferase 2B MAT2B gene encodes the regulatory subunit of methionine adenosyltransferase MAT Recent studies demonstrated that it is highly expressed in a number of human malignancies however is undefined in OS In the present study MAT2B expression was investigated in tumor samples and cell lines In vivo and in vitro lentivirus‑mediated small hairpin RNA was constructed to target the MAT2B gene and examine the role of MAT2B in OS proliferation Microarray analysis was performed to examine the possible downstream molecular target of MAT2B in OS MAT2B was markedly increased in OS specimens compared with the normal tissues and it was additionally abundantly expressed in OS cell lines Inhibition of MAT2B expression caused a marked decrease in proliferation and significant increase in apoptosis In vivo MAT2B silencing significantly inhibited OS cell growth Microarray analysis suggested that epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR and proliferating cell nuclear antigen PCNA may function as downstream targets of MAT2B in OS as confirmed by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays and western blotting Collectively these results suggested that MAT2B serves a critical role in the proliferation of OS by regulating EGFR and PCNA and that it may be a potential therapeutic target and prognostic factor of OS,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[118, 16, 3, 96, 841, 265, 30, 4, 1169, 3788, 5, 334, 356, 28, 364, 3, 483, 1181, 1565, 4, 118, 32, 44, 149, 1784, 3, 5686, 74625, 3381, 23030, 145, 4322, 3, 1253, 3350, 1, 5686, 44782, 21370, 435, 94, 264, 17, 192, 16, 561, 570, 4, 8, 207, 1, 171, 441, 137, 16, 5425, 4, 118, 4, 3, 364, 45, 23030, 55, 10, 565, 4, 30, 347, 2, 31, 285, 4, 386, 2, 4, 439, 51482, 302, 5957, 893, 10, 2776, 6, 283, 3, 23030, 145, 2, 1004, 3, 200, 1, 23030, 4, 118, 457, 1727, 65, 10, 173, 6, 1004, 3, 899, 1489, 219, 283, 1, 23030, 4, 118, 23030, 10, 2195, 101, 4, 118, 623, 72, 5, 3, 295, 742, 2, 192, 10, 1724, 14095, 570, 4, 118, 31, 285, 297, 1, 23030, 55, 1546, 8, 2003, 775, 4, 457, 2, 93, 344, 4, 351, 4, 386, 23030, 2077, 97, 879, 118, 31, 129, 1727, 65, 1148, 17, 829, 129, 161, 153, 227, 2, 5639, 31, 928, 448, 8220, 68, 343, 22, 1489, 637, 1, 23030, 4, 118, 22, 557, 20, 1772, 32494, 1451, 1260, 1329, 1013, 2, 1521, 3661, 2535, 46, 99, 1148, 17, 23030, 4711, 8, 740, 200, 4, 3, 457, 1, 118, 20, 2681, 227, 2, 8220, 2, 17, 192, 68, 40, 8, 174, 189, 283, 2, 177, 161, 1, 118]",1518.0,30942439,45
"Downregulation of the long non‑coding RNA FOXD2‑AS1 inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion in osteosarcoma.",Molecular medicine reports,Mol Med Rep,2019-05-16,"Increasing amounts of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to be involved in the development of cancer. Recently, aberrant expression of the lncRNA forkhead box D2 adjacent opposite strand RNA1 (FOXD2‑AS1) has been reported to be involved in the progression of several types of human cancer. However, the function and mechanism of FOXD2‑AS1 in osteosarcoma (OS) are currently unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the function and mechanism of FOXD2‑AS1 in OS. Firstly, it was revealed that the expression levels of FOXD2‑AS1 were significantly upregulated in OS tissues and cells, compared with in adjacent tissues and normal cells, as determined using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Notably, the overall survival of patients with relatively high FOXD2‑AS1 expression in OS tissues was significantly lower than that of patients with relatively low expression, as determined using Kaplan‑Meier analysis. In addition, loss‑of‑function experiments were performed in vivo and in vitro to study the biological effects of FOXD2‑AS1. The SOSP‑9607 and U2OS OS cell lines were infected with lentivirus‑mediated FOXD2‑AS1 short hairpin RNA; subsequently, the alterations in cell phenotype and downstream molecules were evaluated. Knockdown of FOXD2‑AS1 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of OS cells. Furthermore, the number of cells in the S phase was significantly decreased, which was consistent with the results of the Cell Counting kit 8 proliferation assay. The expression levels of ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2 and phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase were decreased, as determined by western blotting, following FOXD2‑AS1 knockdown. Finally, in a nude mouse model of tumorigenesis, it was revealed that, when FOXD2‑AS1 expression was downregulated, tumor growth was significantly reduced and pulmonary metastatic nodules were markedly reduced. The results of the present study suggested that decreased FOXD2‑AS1 expression may inhibit the growth, migration and invasion of tumor cells, and it may regulate downstream gene expression. In conclusion, these findings indicated that FOXD2‑AS1 may be used as a potential therapeutic target and early tumor marker for the diagnosis and prognosis of OS.",Journal Article,250.0,0.0,Increasing amounts of long noncoding RNAs lncRNAs have been shown to be involved in the development of cancer Recently aberrant expression of the lncRNA forkhead box D2 adjacent opposite strand RNA1 FOXD2‑AS1 has been reported to be involved in the progression of several types of human cancer However the function and mechanism of FOXD2‑AS1 in OS are currently unclear The present study aimed to investigate the function and mechanism of FOXD2‑AS1 in OS Firstly it was revealed that the expression levels of FOXD2‑AS1 were significantly upregulated in OS tissues and cells compared with in adjacent tissues and normal cells as determined using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction Notably the overall survival of patients with relatively high FOXD2‑AS1 expression in OS tissues was significantly lower than that of patients with relatively low expression as determined using Kaplan‑Meier analysis In addition loss‑of‑function experiments were performed in vivo and in vitro to study the biological effects of FOXD2‑AS1 The SOSP‑9607 and U2OS OS cell lines were infected with lentivirus‑mediated FOXD2‑AS1 short hairpin RNA subsequently the alterations in cell phenotype and downstream molecules were evaluated Knockdown of FOXD2‑AS1 inhibited the proliferation migration and invasion of OS cells Furthermore the number of cells in the S phase was significantly decreased which was consistent with the results of the Cell Counting kit 8 proliferation assay The expression levels of ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2 and phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase were decreased as determined by western blotting following FOXD2‑AS1 knockdown Finally in a nude mouse model of tumorigenesis it was revealed that when FOXD2‑AS1 expression was downregulated tumor growth was significantly reduced and pulmonary metastatic nodules were markedly reduced The results of the present study suggested that decreased FOXD2‑AS1 expression may inhibit the growth migration and invasion of tumor cells and it may regulate downstream gene expression In conclusion these findings indicated that FOXD2‑AS1 may be used as a potential therapeutic target and early tumor marker for the diagnosis and prognosis of OS,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[602, 4939, 1, 319, 6420, 4550, 6651, 47, 85, 443, 6, 40, 646, 4, 3, 193, 1, 12, 761, 1898, 55, 1, 3, 6381, 8106, 4971, 4171, 2086, 7021, 4787, 74808, 20963, 71, 85, 210, 6, 40, 646, 4, 3, 91, 1, 392, 630, 1, 171, 12, 137, 3, 343, 2, 670, 1, 20963, 4, 118, 32, 694, 1200, 3, 364, 45, 1295, 6, 963, 3, 343, 2, 670, 1, 20963, 4, 118, 16535, 192, 10, 553, 17, 3, 55, 148, 1, 20963, 11, 97, 2684, 4, 118, 742, 2, 37, 72, 5, 4, 2086, 742, 2, 295, 37, 22, 509, 75, 1772, 32494, 1451, 1260, 1329, 2552, 3, 63, 25, 1, 7, 5, 1352, 64, 20963, 55, 4, 118, 742, 10, 97, 280, 76, 17, 1, 7, 5, 1352, 154, 55, 22, 509, 75, 36322, 65, 4, 352, 74809, 2332, 11, 173, 4, 386, 2, 4, 439, 6, 45, 3, 1037, 176, 1, 20963, 3, 74810, 2, 18445, 118, 31, 285, 11, 3369, 5, 51482, 20963, 978, 5957, 893, 1611, 3, 593, 4, 31, 1005, 2, 1489, 1598, 11, 194, 1563, 1, 20963, 879, 3, 457, 1381, 2, 578, 1, 118, 37, 798, 3, 207, 1, 37, 4, 3, 695, 124, 10, 97, 340, 92, 10, 925, 5, 3, 99, 1, 3, 31, 9479, 1164, 66, 457, 719, 3, 55, 148, 1, 7050, 4027, 1253, 3350, 821, 2, 34816, 2374, 11, 340, 22, 509, 20, 1521, 3661, 366, 20963, 1563, 1368, 4, 8, 2598, 830, 202, 1, 1565, 192, 10, 553, 17, 198, 20963, 55, 10, 3315, 30, 129, 10, 97, 405, 2, 1087, 113, 2597, 11, 2195, 405, 3, 99, 1, 3, 364, 45, 1148, 17, 340, 20963, 55, 68, 1433, 3, 129, 1381, 2, 578, 1, 30, 37, 2, 192, 68, 2288, 1489, 145, 55, 4, 1221, 46, 272, 1103, 17, 20963, 68, 40, 95, 22, 8, 174, 189, 283, 2, 191, 30, 952, 9, 3, 147, 2, 356, 1, 118]",2220.0,31115575,149
