Chronic myelogenous leukemia: update on biology and treatment.,"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)","Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",1999-02-01,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder that follows a characteristic clinical course in which a chronic phase of variable duration precedes an accelerated, and ultimately blastic, phase, which is generally fatal. This disorder results from a clonal expansion of transformed hematopoietic progenitor cells and includes myeloid, monocytic, erythroid, megakaryocytic, and lymphoid lineages. At the molecular level, CML is characterized by the bcr-abl fusion gene, which results from the reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), creating the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. Chronic myelogenous leukemia was the first human disease for which a specific karyotype abnormality was demonstrated and could be linked to pathogenetic events of leukemogenesis. The outlook for patients with CML has changed dramatically over the last decade. The median survival time of patients has doubled to 5 to 7 years, with up to 50% of patients alive at 5 years. This development is due to refinements in allogeneic stem-cell transplantation and growing expertise in the use of interferon-alfa (Intron A, Roferon-A), a biological agent that has been shown to suppress the leukemic clone and to prolong survival in patients with CML. This review provides a concise update of the biology of CML, as well as current therapeutic options and management strategies.",Comparative Study,7659.0,73.0,Chronic myelogenous CML is a disorder that follows a characteristic clinical course in which a chronic phase of variable duration precedes an accelerated and ultimately blastic phase which is generally fatal This disorder results from a clonal expansion of transformed hematopoietic progenitor cells and includes myeloid monocytic erythroid megakaryocytic and lymphoid lineages At the molecular level CML is characterized by the bcr-abl fusion gene which results from the reciprocal translocation t 9 22 q34 q11 creating the Philadelphia Ph chromosome Chronic myelogenous was the first human disease for which a specific karyotype abnormality was demonstrated and could be linked to pathogenetic events of leukemogenesis The outlook for patients with CML has changed dramatically over the last decade The median survival time of patients has doubled to 5 to 7 years with up to 50 of patients alive at 5 years This development is due to refinements in allogeneic stem-cell transplantation and growing expertise in the use of interferon-alfa Intron A Roferon-A a biological agent that has been shown to suppress the leukemic clone and to prolong survival in patients with CML This review provides a concise update of the biology of CML as well as current therapeutic options and management strategies,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[442, 2194, 903, 16, 8, 2645, 17, 2962, 8, 2037, 38, 906, 4, 92, 8, 442, 124, 1, 1347, 654, 20146, 35, 2241, 2, 2050, 6529, 124, 92, 16, 1228, 3034, 26, 2645, 99, 29, 8, 1946, 1422, 1, 2423, 1007, 2520, 37, 2, 1920, 533, 9003, 7839, 14385, 2, 2303, 7234, 28, 3, 219, 301, 903, 16, 765, 20, 3, 1062, 1425, 1212, 145, 92, 99, 29, 3, 8020, 2006, 102, 83, 350, 16609, 11532, 6147, 3, 3006, 2058, 1170, 442, 2194, 10, 3, 157, 171, 34, 9, 92, 8, 112, 3385, 3698, 10, 264, 2, 359, 40, 1199, 6, 10781, 281, 1, 5661, 3, 8628, 9, 7, 5, 903, 71, 2368, 2729, 252, 3, 1060, 2025, 3, 52, 25, 98, 1, 7, 71, 8431, 6, 33, 6, 67, 60, 5, 126, 6, 212, 1, 7, 1701, 28, 33, 60, 26, 193, 16, 520, 6, 10518, 4, 1063, 452, 31, 497, 2, 1921, 4935, 4, 3, 119, 1, 1688, 4443, 6259, 8, 42793, 8, 8, 1037, 420, 17, 71, 85, 443, 6, 3134, 3, 2015, 3910, 2, 6, 3615, 25, 4, 7, 5, 903, 26, 206, 777, 8, 11071, 2991, 1, 3, 891, 1, 903, 22, 149, 22, 291, 189, 838, 2, 284, 422]",1298.0,10079468,138
Effects of the Bcr/abl kinase inhibitors STI571 and adaphostin (NSC 680410) on chronic myelogenous leukemia cells in vitro.,Blood,Blood,2002-01-01,"The adenosine triphosphate binding-site-directed agent STI571 and the tyrphostin adaphostin are undergoing evaluation as bcr/abl kinase inhibitors. The current study compared the effects of these agents on the survival of K562 cells, bcr/abl-transduced FDC-P1 cells, and myeloid progenitors from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) compared with healthy donors. Treatment of K562 cells with 10 microM adaphostin resulted in decreased p210(bcr/abl) polypeptide levels in the first 6 hours, followed by caspase activation and accumulation of apoptotic cells in less than 12 hours. By 24 hours, 90% of the cells were apoptotic and unable to form colonies. In contrast, 20 microM STI571 caused rapid inhibition of bcr/abl autophosphorylation without p210(bcr/abl) degradation. Although this was followed by the inhibition of Stat5 phosphorylation and the down-regulation of Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1, only 7% +/- 3% and 25% +/- 9% of cells were apoptotic at 16 and 24 hours, respectively. Instead, the cytotoxic effects of STI571 became more pronounced with prolonged exposure, with IC90 values greater than 20 microM and 1.0 +/- 0.6 microM after 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Consistent with these results, 24-hour adaphostin exposure inhibited CML granulocyte colony-forming units (CFU-G) (median IC50, 12 microM) but not normal CFU-G (median IC50, greater than 20 microM), whereas 24-hour STI571 treatment had no effect on CML or normal CFU-G. Additional experiments revealed that STI571-resistant K562 cells remained sensitive to adaphostin. Moreover, the combination of STI571 + adaphostin induced more cytotoxicity in K562 cells and in CML CFU-G than either agent alone did. Collectively, these results identify adaphostin as a mechanistically distinct CML-selective agent that retains activity in STI571-resistant cell lines.",Journal Article,6594.0,100.0,The adenosine triphosphate binding-site-directed agent STI571 and the tyrphostin adaphostin are undergoing evaluation as bcr/abl kinase inhibitors The current study compared the effects of these agents on the survival of K562 cells bcr/abl-transduced FDC-P1 cells and myeloid progenitors from patients with chronic myelogenous CML compared with healthy donors Treatment of K562 cells with 10 microM adaphostin resulted in decreased p210 bcr/abl polypeptide levels in the first 6 hours followed by caspase activation and accumulation of apoptotic cells in less than 12 hours By 24 hours 90 of the cells were apoptotic and unable to form colonies In contrast 20 microM STI571 caused rapid inhibition of bcr/abl autophosphorylation without p210 bcr/abl degradation Although this was followed by the inhibition of Stat5 phosphorylation and the down-regulation of Bcl-x L and Mcl-1 only 7 +/- 3 and 25 +/- 9 of cells were apoptotic at 16 and 24 hours respectively Instead the cytotoxic effects of STI571 became more pronounced with prolonged exposure with IC90 values greater than 20 microM and 1.0 +/- 0.6 microM after 24 and 48 hours respectively Consistent with these results 24-hour adaphostin exposure inhibited CML granulocyte colony-forming units CFU-G median IC50 12 microM but not normal CFU-G median IC50 greater than 20 microM whereas 24-hour STI571 treatment had no effect on CML or normal CFU-G.

Effect of tolerance to noninherited maternal antigens on the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease after bone marrow transplantation from a parent or an HLA-haploidentical sibling.,Blood,Blood,2002-03-01,"In haploidentical transplantation, the mismatched haplotype of the donor can originate from either of the parents. We refer to such mismatched haplotypes as noninherited maternal antigens (NIMA haplotype) or noninherited paternal antigens (NIPA haplotype). To determine whether exposure to maternal HLA antigens benefits patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation, we analyzed graft failure and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after transplantations from parental or haploidentical sibling donors. We studied 269 patients receiving 1 or 2 HLA-A, -B, -DR antigen-mismatched sibling or parental non-T-cell-depleted bone marrow transplants for acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or chronic myelogenous leukemia between 1985 and 1997 that were reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry. Included were 121 (45%) NIMA-mismatched and 148 (55%) NIPA-mismatched transplantations. Sixty-three (52%) of the NIMA-mismatched transplants and 69 (47%) of the NIPA-mismatched transplants were from haploidentical sibling donors. Sibling transplantations mismatched for NIMA had similar rates of graft failure but lower rates of acute GVHD (P <.02) than NIPA-mismatched sibling transplantations.

Imatinib induces durable hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with accelerated phase chronic myeloid leukemia: results of a phase 2 study.,Blood,Blood,2002-03-01,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is caused by expression of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase oncogene, the product of the t(9;22) Philadelphia translocation. Patients with CML in accelerated phase have rapidly progressive disease and are characteristically unresponsive to existing therapies. Imatinib (formerly STI571) is a rationally developed, orally administered inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl kinase. A total of 235 CML patients were enrolled in this study, of whom 181 had a confirmed diagnosis of accelerated phase. Patients were treated with imatinib at 400 or 600 mg/d and were evaluated for hematologic and cytogenetic response, time to progression, survival, and toxicity. Imatinib induced hematologic response in 82% of patients and sustained hematologic responses lasting at least 4 weeks in 69% (complete in 34%). The rate of major cytogenetic response was 24% (complete in 17%). Estimated 12-month progression-free and overall survival rates were 59% and 74%, respectively. Nonhematologic toxicity was usually mild or moderate, and hematologic toxicity was manageable. In comparison to 400 mg, imatinib doses of 600 mg/d led to more cytogenetic responses (28% compared to 16%), longer duration of response (79% compared to 57% at 12 months), time to disease progression (67% compared to 44% at 12 months), and overall survival (78% compared to 65% at 12 months), with no clinically relevant increase in toxicity.

Simultaneous homoharringtonine and interferon-alpha in the treatment of patients with chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2002-04-01,"Homoharringtonine (HHT) has antileukemic activity in patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Combinations of HHT, interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), and cytarabine (ara-C) have been studied in various CML phases. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity profiles of a combination regimen of simultaneous HHT and IFN-alpha therapy in patients with chronic-phase CML who were not exposed previously to either agent. Forty-seven patients were treated: 37 patients with early chronic-phase CML (2 patients with clonal evolution) and 10 patients with late chronic-phase CML. Their median age was 62 years (range, 23-73 years). HHT was given at a dose of 2.5 mg/m(2) by continuous intravenous infusion over 24 hours daily for 5 days every month, and IFN-alpha was given daily at a target dose of 5 x 10(6) units/m(2) subcutaneously. Response, survival, and treatment toxicity were analyzed. Overall, the complete hematologic response (CHR) rate was 85%; the cytogenetic response rate was 66%, with major cytogenetic responses (Ph positive in < 35% of metaphases) in 49% of patients and complete cytogenetic responses in 21% of patients. The CHR rate, cytogenetic response rate, and major cytogenetic response rate were 84%, 69%, and 52%, respectively, in patients with early chronic-phase CML. Among the 10 patients with late chronic-phase CML, the CHR rate, cytogenetic response rate, and major cytogenetic response rate were 80%, 50%, and 40%, respectively. Response rates in patients age > 60 years were 84%, 62%, and 49% for CHR, cytogenetic response, and major cytogenetic response. Myelosuppression was frequent but manageable: Anemia with hemoglobin < 8.0 g/dL occurred in 36% of patients, requiring dose adjustments and erythropoietin therapy. Nonhematologic toxicities were mainly fatigue, aches, and gastrointestinal disturbances. Dose reductions with multiple courses were significant and were due to myelosuppression: After 6-24 courses, the median daily IFN-alpha dose was 1 MU/m(2), and the median number of days on HHT per month was 2 days.

The hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is the Philadelphia chromosome translocation t(9;22), which results in the bcr-abl fusion gene. As an alteration that is nearly universal in CML cells, bcr-abl presents a therapeutic target that is unique to the pathological cells in CML patients.

ATP6S1 elicits potent humoral responses associated with immune-mediated tumor destruction.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2002-04-30,"An important goal of cancer immunology is the identification of antigens associated with tumor destruction. Vaccination with irradiated tumor cells engineered to secrete granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) generates potent, specific, and long-lasting antitumor immunity in multiple murine tumor models. A phase I clinical trial of this vaccination strategy in patients with advanced melanoma demonstrated the consistent induction of dense CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltrates in distant metastases, resulting in extensive tumor destruction, fibrosis, and edema. Antimelanoma antibody and cytotoxic T cell responses were associated with tumor cell death. To characterize the targets of these responses, we screened an autologous cDNA expression library prepared from a densely infiltrated metastasis with postvaccination sera from a long-term responding patient. High-titer IgG antibodies detected ATP6S1, a putative accessory unit of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase complex. A longitudinal analysis of this patient revealed an association between the vaccine-induced increase in antibodies to ATP6S1 and tumor destruction. Three additional vaccinated melanoma patients and three metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma patients vaccinated with autologous GM-CSF-secreting tumor cells similarly showed a correlation between humoral responses to ATP6S1 and tumor destruction. Moreover, a chronic myelogenous leukemia patient who experienced a complete remission after CD4(+) donor lymphocyte infusions also developed high-titer antibodies to ATP6S1. Lastly, vaccination with GM-CSF-secreting B16 melanoma cells stimulated high-titer antibodies to ATPS1 in a murine model.

CML is caused by expression of the chimeric BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase oncogene, the product of the t(9;22) Philadelphia translocation. Imatinib (Glivec, formerly STI571) is a rationally developed, orally administered inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. A total of 260 patients with CML were enrolled in a phase II trial, of whom 229 had a confirmed diagnosis of CML in blast crisis.

Imatinib mesylate (STI571) therapy for Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast phase.,Blood,Blood,2002-05-01,"Molecular abnormalities caused by the hybrid Bcr-Abl gene are causally associated with the development and progression of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Imatinib mesylate (STI571), a specific Bcr-Abl tyrosine-kinase signal-transduction inhibitor, has shown encouraging activity in phase I and II studies of CML. Here, we describe the use of imatinib mesylate to treat 75 patients in blast-phase CML (median age, 53 years; 65 with nonlymphoid and 10 with lymphoid blasts), and compare the results with those of a historical control group treated with standard cytarabine-based therapy. Imatinib mesylate was given as oral doses at 300 to 1000 mg per day and was the first salvage therapy for 47 patients. The objective response rate was 52% (39 of 75 patients: 16 had complete and 3 had partial hematologic response; 12 had hematologic improvement; 7 returned to second chronic phase; and 1 had a complete response in extramedullary blastic disease). Response rates were not different between nonlymphoid and lymphoid groups. The cytogenetic response rate was 16% (12 patients: 5 complete, 3 partial [Ph(+) below 35%], and 4 minor [Ph(+), 34% to 90%]). The estimated median overall survival was 6.5 months; the estimated 1-year survival was 22%. Response to therapy (landmark analysis at 8 weeks) was associated with survival prolongation. Compared with standard cytarabine combinations, imatinib mesylate therapy was less toxic and produced a higher response rate (55% versus 29%, P =.001), longer median survival (7 versus 4 months, P =.04), and lower 4-week induction mortality (4% versus 15%, P =.07).

Imatinib mesylate (STI571) inhibits growth of primitive malignant progenitors in chronic myelogenous leukemia through reversal of abnormally increased proliferation.,Blood,Blood,2002-05-01,"Imatinib mesylate (STI571) is a promising new treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The effect of imatinib mesylate on primitive malignant progenitors in CML has not been evaluated, and it is not clear whether suppression of progenitor growth represents inhibition of increased proliferation, induction of apoptosis, or both. We demonstrated here that in vitro exposure to concentrations of imatinib mesylate usually achieved in patients (1-2 microM) for 96 hours inhibited BCR/ABL-positive primitive progenitors (6-week long-term culture-initiating cells [LTCICs]) as well as committed progenitors (colony-forming cells [CFCs]). No suppression of normal LTCICs and significantly less suppression of normal CFCs were observed. A higher concentration of imatinib mesylate (5 microM) did not significantly increase suppression of CML or normal LTCICs but did increase suppression of CML CFCs, and to a lesser extent, normal CFCs. Analysis of cell division using the fluorescent dye carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester indicated that imatinib mesylate (1-2 microM) inhibits cycling of CML primitive (CD34(+)CD38(-)) and committed (CD34(+)CD38(+)) progenitors to a much greater extent than normal cells. Conversely, treatment with 1 to 2 microM imatinib mesylate did not significantly increase the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis. Although a higher concentration of imatinib mesylate (5 microM) led to an increase in apoptosis of CML cells, apoptosis also increased in normal samples. In summary, at clinically relevant concentrations, imatinib mesylate selectively suppresses CML primitive progenitors by reversing abnormally increased proliferation but does not significantly increase apoptosis. These results suggest that inhibition of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase by imatinib mesylate restores normal hematopoiesis by removing the proliferative advantage of CML progenitors but that elimination of all CML progenitors may not occur.",Comparative Study,6474.0,214.0,Imatinib mesylate STI571 is a promising new treatment for chronic myelogenous CML The effect of imatinib mesylate on primitive malignant progenitors in CML has not been evaluated and it is not clear whether suppression of progenitor growth represents inhibition of increased proliferation induction of apoptosis or both We demonstrated here that in vitro exposure to concentrations of imatinib mesylate usually achieved in patients 1-2 microM for 96 hours inhibited BCR/ABL-positive primitive progenitors 6-week long-term culture-initiating cells LTCICs as well as committed progenitors colony-forming cells CFCs No suppression of normal LTCICs and significantly less suppression of normal CFCs were observed A higher concentration of imatinib mesylate 5 microM did not significantly increase suppression of CML or normal LTCICs but did increase suppression of CML CFCs and to a lesser extent normal CFCs Analysis of cell division using the fluorescent dye carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester indicated that imatinib mesylate 1-2 microM inhibits cycling of CML primitive CD34 CD38 and committed CD34 CD38 progenitors to a much greater extent than normal cells Conversely treatment with 1 to 2 microM imatinib mesylate did not significantly increase the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis Although a higher concentration of imatinib mesylate 5 microM led to an increase in apoptosis of CML cells apoptosis also increased in normal samples In summary at clinically relevant concentrations imatinib mesylate selectively suppresses CML primitive progenitors by reversing abnormally increased proliferation but does not significantly increase apoptosis These results suggest that inhibition of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase by imatinib mesylate restores normal hematopoiesis by removing the proliferative advantage of CML progenitors but that elimination of all CML progenitors may not occur,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[577, 2347, 5735, 16, 8, 721, 217, 24, 9, 442, 2194, 903, 3, 254, 1, 577, 2347, 23, 5594, 393, 4321, 4, 903, 71, 44, 85, 194, 2, 192, 16, 44, 885, 317, 1332, 1, 2520, 129, 1449, 297, 1, 101, 457, 504, 1, 351, 15, 110, 21, 264, 467, 17, 4, 439, 645, 6, 1003, 1, 577, 2347, 2082, 513, 4, 7, 14, 18, 3550, 9, 921, 1459, 879, 1062, 1425, 109, 5594, 4321, 49, 647, 319, 337, 2099, 2637, 37, 37156, 22, 149, 22, 9552, 4321, 1975, 4525, 37, 33227, 77, 1332, 1, 295, 37156, 2, 97, 299, 1332, 1, 295, 33227, 11, 164, 8, 142, 1227, 1, 577, 2347, 33, 3550, 205, 44, 97, 344, 1332, 1, 903, 15, 295, 37156, 84, 205, 344, 1332, 1, 903, 33227, 2, 6, 8, 5191, 1039, 295, 33227, 65, 1, 31, 5750, 75, 3, 2910, 3796, 30236, 24445, 27885, 9617, 1103, 17, 577, 2347, 14, 18, 3550, 1576, 9165, 1, 903, 5594, 2215, 4469, 2, 9552, 2215, 4469, 4321, 6, 8, 1802, 378, 1039, 76, 295, 37, 3154, 24, 5, 14, 6, 18, 3550, 577, 2347, 205, 44, 97, 344, 3, 1150, 1, 37, 479, 351, 242, 8, 142, 1227, 1, 577, 2347, 33, 3550, 836, 6, 35, 344, 4, 351, 1, 903, 37, 351, 120, 101, 4, 295, 347, 4, 1962, 28, 505, 867, 1003, 577, 2347, 2382, 4079, 903, 5594, 4321, 20, 9953, 11749, 101, 457, 84, 1097, 44, 97, 344, 351, 46, 99, 309, 17, 297, 1, 1062, 1425, 564, 216, 20, 577, 2347, 8489, 295, 5114, 20, 9026, 3, 2441, 1874, 1, 903, 4321, 84, 17, 3730, 1, 62, 903, 4321, 68, 44, 1271]",1898.0,11986238,124
Current therapy of chronic myelogenous leukemia.,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",Intern.

Immunogenicity of a p210(BCR-ABL) fusion domain candidate DNA vaccine targeted to dendritic cells by a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector in vitro.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2002-06-01,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is characterized by a t(9;22) translocation, which results in the expression of chimeric BCR-ABL fusion oncoproteins that are necessary for oncogenesis, unique to the leukemic clones, and represent enticing targets for immunotherapy. As a strategy for the immunotherapy of CML, we constructed a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector encoding the p210(BCR-ABL) b3a2 variant fusion region with flanking sequences (CWRBA) and used it to express the BCR-ABL fusion region within primary human dendritic cells (DCs), the most potent antigen-presenting cells currently known. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors were primed and restimulated in vitro with autologous DCs transduced with purified CWRBA, CWRAP (negative control), or pulsed with a peptide corresponding to the fusion domain (positive control). No specific responses were generated using DCs transduced with CWRAP. In contrast, CWRBA-transduced DCs primed autologous T cells in an antigen-specific, MHC-restricted fashion to levels comparable with the positive control. CWRBA-transduced DCs elicited both cytotoxic CD4+/Th1 and CD8+ responses, although the former were more readily detected in this system.

Systemic therapy for advanced soft-tissue sarcomas.,Current oncology reports,Curr Oncol Rep,2002-07-01,"The field of oncology is experiencing a paradigm shift from broad-spectrum cytotoxic therapies to more specific molecularly based targeted therapies. The activity of imatinib mesylate in chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) has reinforced our faith in translational research and its potential impact on the cure of cancer and improvement in quality of life for patients. This breakthrough has been particularly exciting for the field of sarcoma and for patients with advanced GIST, for whom no other effective therapy was available. Unfortunately, as is becoming increasingly clear, cancer is a very complex problem with multiple mechanisms and pathways that function either independently or interdependently enabling cell survival. We are therefore far away from having solved the problem. Attempts at refining the currently available therapeutic armamentarium to maximize the therapeutic index (dose intensification with growth factor support) must continue in parallel with laboratory-based research identifying critical targets to be inhibited or blocked.

Cancer Res.,2002-07-01,"Imatinib mesylate, a specific Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown encouraging activity in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We treated 237 patients (median age, 50 years; age range, 18-82 years) with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive accelerated-phase CML with oral imatinib mesylate at daily doses of 400 mg (26 patients) or 600 mg (211 patients) and evaluated response and survival characteristics in univariate and multivariate analyses. Among the 200 patients with accelerated-phase CML for whom follow-up was 3 months or more, rates of complete and partial hematological response were 80% and 10%. Cytogenetic responses were evident in 90 patients [45%; complete response in 47 patients (24%) and partial response (Ph 1-34%) in 21 patients (11%)]. The estimated 18-month survival rate was 73%. The estimated complete hematological response rate at 18 months was 68%; that for cytogenetic response was 82%. In multivariate analyses, a diagnosis-to-treatment interval of 3 years or more, splenomegaly, and peripheral blasts predicted poor major cytogenetic response; age >60 years, marrow basophilia, and clonal evolution predicted poor survival. The 600-mg drug dose was associated with better cytogenetic response and survival in univariate analysis (P < 0.01) but not in multivariate analysis. Landmark analysis showed that achieving a cytogenetic response at 3 months or a major cytogenetic response (Ph < 35%) at 6 months was associated with better long-term survival.

Critical role for Gab2 in transformation by BCR/ABL.,Cancer cell,Cancer Cell,2002-06-01,"The BCR/ABL oncogene causes chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in humans and a CML-like disease, as well as lymphoid leukemia, in mice. p210 BCR/ABL is an activated tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates itself and several cellular signaling proteins. The autophosphorylation site tyrosine 177 binds the adaptor Grb2 and helps determine the lineage and severity of BCR/ABL disease: Tyr177 mutation (BCR/ABL-Y177F) dramatically impairs myeloid leukemogenesis, while diminishing lymphoid leukemogenesis. The critical signal(s) from Tyr177 has remained unclear. We report that Tyr177 recruits the scaffolding adaptor Gab2 via a Grb2/Gab2 complex. Compared to BCR/ABL-expressing Ba/F3 cells, BCR/ABL-Y177F cells exhibit markedly reduced Gab2 tyrosine phosphorylation and association of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and Shp2 with Gab2 and BCR/ABL, and decreased PI3K/Akt and Ras/Erk activation, cell proliferation, and spontaneous migration. Remarkably, bone marrow myeloid progenitors from Gab2 (-/-) mice are resistant to transformation by BCR/ABL, whereas lymphoid transformation is diminished as a consequence of markedly increased apoptosis. BCR/ABL-evoked PI3K/Akt and Ras/Erk activation also are impaired in Gab2 (-/-) primary myeloid and lymphoid cells.

Targeted alpha particle immunotherapy for myeloid leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2002-08-01,"Unlike beta particle-emitting isotopes, alpha emitters can selectively kill individual cancer cells with a single atomic decay. HuM195, a humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody, specifically targets myeloid leukemia cells and has activity against minimal disease. When labeled with the beta-emitters (131)I and (90)Y, HuM195 can eliminate large leukemic burdens in patients, but it produces prolonged myelosuppression requiring hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at high doses. To enhance the potency of native HuM195 yet avoid the nonspecific cytotoxicity of beta-emitting constructs, the alpha-emitting isotope (213)Bi was conjugated to HuM195. Eighteen patients with relapsed and refractory acute myelogenous leukemia or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia were treated with 10.36 to 37.0 MBq/kg (213)Bi-HuM195. No significant extramedullary toxicity was seen. All 17 evaluable patients developed myelosuppression, with a median time to recovery of 22 days.

In vitro effects of STI 571-containing drug combinations on the growth of Philadelphia-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia cells.,Cancer,Cancer,2002-05-01,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is characterized by a molecular aberration, a fusion BCR-ABL gene encoding for aberrant tyrosine kinase activity, which is crucial in the pathogenesis of CML. In vitro, inhibition of BCR-ABL protein tyrosine kinase activity by a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Imatinib mesylate (STI571; formerly CGP57148B), successfully suppressed proliferation/survival of the BCR-ABL positive clones. In clinical studies, hematologic and cytogenetic remissions have been achieved in most patients with chronic phase CML; in accelerated and blastic phases of CML, STI571 appeared less effective. In the current study, the authors tested combinations of STI571 and cytarabine and homoharringtonine (HHT), drugs with documented activity in CML. The single agents and their combinations were studied for in vitro effect on proliferation of BCR-ABL positive cell lines KBM5 and KBM7 by 3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5 diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay and on primary patient-derived BCR-ABL cells by clonogenic assays. The in vitro additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effects of cytarabine and HHT with STI571 were then investigated by computer-assisted analysis using the CalcuSyn software. STI571 consistently suppressed BCR-ABL positive cell proliferation with a dose-effect correlation.

Differential sensitivity to imatinib of 2 patients with metastatic sarcoma arising from dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2002-08-01,"Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare superficial sarcoma usually affecting the trunk, with significant risk of local recurrence. It is characterized by the presence of ring chromosomes or chromosomal translocations fusing the promoter of the collagen gene COL1A1 to the platelet-derived growth factor beta-chain gene PDGFB, increasing the production of PDGF locally and promoting autocrine or paracrine tumor growth. Fewer than 5% of patients with DFSP develop metastatic sarcoma, with a poor subsequent prognosis. Imatinib (STI-571) was developed as an inhibitor of the PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase and has proven clinical activity against chronic myelogenous leukemia (expressing bcr-abl) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (expressing c-kit). We describe 2 patients with metastatic and unresectable metastases from DFSP treated with imatinib. After confirmation of negative CD117 status of 2 sarcomas arising from DFSP, patients were given imatinib 400 mg po qd and assessed at regular intervals for their tolerance and response to therapy. One patient had a transient response, then progressed rapidly and died of disease. Another patient showed a partial response to therapy after 2 months, with resolution of superior vena cava syndrome and shrinking of metastatic lung lesions. His response is ongoing after 6 months of therapy. These clinical data confirm findings from models of DFSP and support the use of imatinib in the rare setting of metastatic DFSP.

"CML28 is a broadly immunogenic antigen, which is overexpressed in tumor cells.",Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2002-10-01,"Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) reliably induces durable remission in 75-80% of patients with relapsed chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. To identify immunological targets of the graft-versus-leukemia response (GVL) after DLI, we used CML post-DLI responder sera to screen a CML cDNA expression library. One of the antigens identified in this screen is a M(r) 28,000 protein, termed CML28. CML28 is identical to hRrp46p, a component of the human exosome, a multiprotein complex involved in the 3' processing of RNA. Components of the human exosome include known autoantigens, such as PMScl-100, an autoantibody target in patients with polymyositis, scleroderma, or polymyositis-scleroderma overlap syndrome. Recombinant CML28-GST fusion protein was purified, and used in Western blot and ELISA to demonstrate the development of a high-titer CML28-specific IgG antibody response in a patient with relapsed CML who responded to DLI. Northern blotting demonstrated that CML28 is highly expressed in a variety of hematopoietic and epithelial tumor cell lines, but not in normal hematopoietic tissues or other normal tissue, with the exception of testis. Purified recombinant CML28 was used to generate a CML28-specific murine monoclonal antibody. Western blotting with CML28 monoclonal antibody against whole-cell lysates derived from blood and marrow of normal donors and patients with leukemia revealed high expression of this antigen in tumor but not in normal samples. Because CML28 was highly expressed in epithelial tumor cell lines, anti-CML28 responses were also examined in patients with solid tumors. By ELISA, we found specific serological responses in 10-33% of patients with lung cancer, melanoma, and prostate cancer. Our studies suggest that immunogenicity of CML28 is likely because of overexpression of this antigen in tumor cells.

"Characteristics and outcome of patients with Philadelphia chromosome negative, bcr/abl negative chronic myelogenous leukemia.",Cancer,Cancer,2002-10-01,"Up to 5% of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) do not have the Philadelphia (Ph) translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) or a bcr/abl molecular rearrangement. Although the diagnostic criteria of this entity are still under debate, there is general agreement that patients with Ph negative, bcr/abl negative CML have a severe clinical course that is not affected significantly by current treatment options. A population of 76 patients with bcr/abl negative CML who had received minimal or no previous therapy was characterized carefully with the intent of investigating clinical and hematologic variables and their association with survival by univariate, correlation, and multivariate analyses. A group of 73 patients with Ph negative CML who were not tested for the bcr/abl rearrangement (bcr/abl unknown) was analyzed separately and used for extension of the analysis. In the bcr/abl negative patient population, the median overall survival was 24 months. At the time of the analysis, 38 patients (50%) had died, and blastic transformation preceded death in 31%. Chromosomal abnormalities were found in 30% of the 76 patients, with trisomy 8 the most common abnormality. Complex chromosomal abnormalities were rare, and monosomy 7 was not observed. Survival was not affected significantly by treatment. Multivariate analysis identified older age (> 65 years), anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dL), and severe leukocytosis (white blood cells > 50 x 10(9)/L) as variables with independent prognostic significance for poor survival. A prognostic scoring system stratified patients into a low-risk group (53%) and a high-risk group (47%), with median survivals of 38 months and 9 months, respectively.

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2002-01-01,"Complete bioavailability of i.v. busulfan (Bu) provides dose assurance by reducing the interdose and interpatient variability in Bu systemic exposure (Bu-SE) associated with the oral formulation. We hypothesized that Bu-SE, represented by the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), would correlate with treatment outcome after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Therefore, we analyzed the risk of death, incidence of regimen-related toxicity, and incidence of acute GVHD (aGVHD) as functions of the per dose i.v. Bu AUC in 36 CML patients who received a HSCT from an HLA-matched family donor after the i.v. BuCy2 regimen. Per-dose Bu AUCs were calculated for each subject using data obtained for doses 1, 5, 9, and 13. Toxicity was evaluated using the modified National Cancer Institute criteria. Because no patient developed veno-occlusive disease, increased serum bilirubin was used to characterize hepatotoxicity. We found that the probabilities of developing gastrointestinal toxicity (P = .01), hepatotoxicity (P < .01), mucositis (P = .09), and aGVHD (P < .01) all increased with increasing AUC. Further, the risk of death was significantly lower for patients having a per-dose AUC between approximately 950 and 1520 microMol-min, whereas the risk increased sharply with either lower or higher AUC values.

Clinical course of thrombocytopenia in patients treated with imatinib mesylate for accelerated phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2002-11-01,"We studied 28 patients with accelerated phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who were enrolled on the Novartis expanded access study 114. Diagnosis of accelerated phase CML was based on karyotypic evolution (n = 9) and hematologic criteria (n = 18). All patients were begun on 600 mg/day of imatinib mesylate. Dose reductions to 400 mg/day and then 300 mg/day were prescribed for an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of <0.5/microl or a platelet count of <20,000/microl. Twenty-seven of the 28 patients continued treatment for a median of 34 weeks. Eleven patients developed thrombocytopenia following an average of 8.4 +/- 1.4 weeks of therapy. The onset of thrombocytopenia was associated with disease progression in one patient and a decline in bone marrow megakaryocytes in the other 10. Nine patients recovered to a platelet count of >20,000/microl after an average of 19.7 +/- 1.8 weeks. Patients who developed thrombocytopenia had a longer duration of disease (9.39 vs. 4.35 years; P < 0.01) and were more likely to be diagnosed with accelerated phase CML by hematologic criteria. Hematologic responses in patients with and without thrombocytopenia were comparable; however, 31.3% of patients without thrombocytopenia had a complete cytogenetic response compared to none of those with thrombocytopenia.

Identification and treatment of chemoresistant inoperable or metastatic GIST: experience with the selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (STI571).,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",Eur. J. Cancer,2002-09-01,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract. The concept of GIST and the definition of GIST pathology have evolved greatly over the past 5 years. GIST has been shown to share immunohistochemical, ultrastructural and histogenic similarities with the interstitial cells of Cajal. Both GIST and the interstitial cells of Cajal express KIT, the receptor tyrosine kinase that is the protein product of the c-kit proto-oncogene. KIT is universally phosphorylated in GISTs. Sequencing of c-kit complementary DNA from human GIST cells has demonstrated a high frequency of mutations that lead to constitutive activation of the KIT tyrosine kinase in the absence of stimulation by its physiologic ligand (stem cell factor). This, in turn, causes uncontrolled stimulation of downstream signaling cascades with aberrant cellular proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. Historically, malignant GIST has been highly refractory to conventional cytotoxic therapy. Signal transduction inhibition as cancer therapy was first tested successfully with imatinib mesylate (formerly known as STI571), a selective small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with the initial target being blockade of Bcr-Abl, the oncogene with tyrosine kinase activity responsible for the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Imatinib was subsequently shown to block activity of the KIT tyrosine kinase as well, and in laboratory studies this led to apoptotic death of GIST cells. The first GIST patient to receive imatinib exhibited dramatic benefit despite far-advanced metastatic disease that was previously refractory to all chemotherapy. Subsequently, multicenter clinical trials have been performed to assess the safety, efficacy and biologic activity of imatinib in patients with advanced GIST. The results from these studies have established imatinib as an effective new therapeutic alternative for the majority of patients with advanced GIST, a solid tumor for which no prior chemotherapy has ever shown antitumor efficacy.

Prognostic significance of cytogenetic clonal evolution in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia on imatinib mesylate therapy.,Blood,Blood,2003-01-30,"Cytogenetic clonal evolution (CE) is a known poor prognostic factor in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (Ph-positive CML). However, its prognostic relevance in the era of imatinib therapy is unknown. We investigated the independent prognostic relevance of CE in 498 patients with Ph-positive CML treated with imatinib for chronic or accelerated phases. One hundred twenty-one patients had CE alone (n = 70) or with other accelerated phase criteria (n = 51). Patients were compared in 4 categories: chronic phase (n = 295), CE only (n = 70), accelerated phase without CE (n = 82), and accelerated phase with CE (n = 51). Statistical methods used established methodologies for univariate and multivariate analyses. In chronic and accelerated phases of CML, CE was not associated with significant differences in major or complete cytogenetic response rates, but it was an independent poor prognostic factor for survival by multivariate analyses in both chronic (P =.005) and accelerated phase (P =.03). Multivariate analyses conducted at the 3-month landmark (including the 3-month cytogenetic response) identified the lack of cytogenetic response at 3 months to be a stronger independent poor prognostic factor for survival than CE for both chronic (major cytogenetic response versus other) and accelerated phase (any cytogenetic response versus other). We conclude that cytogenetic CE is not an important factor for achieving major or complete cytogenetic response with imatinib mesylate therapy, but it is an independent poor prognostic factor for survival in both chronic and accelerated phases of CML.

Complete cytogenetic and molecular responses to interferon-alpha-based therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia are associated with excellent long-term prognosis.,Cancer,Cancer,2003-02-01,"Little is known regarding long-term prognosis among patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who achieve a complete cytogenetic response (0% Ph-positive cells) after treatment with interferon-alpha. The authors analyzed 512 patients with Ph-positive, early chronic-phase CML who were treated with interferon-based therapies between 1981-1995 for the incidence and durability of complete cytogenetic response, and in relation to long-term prognosis. One hundred forty patients (27%) achieved a complete cytogenetic response. Their 10-year survival rate was 78%. At the time of last follow-up, 44 patients (31%, 9% of the total) were alive, 21 in first and 23 in second durable complete cytogenetic response (median, 127 months; range, 88-191 months); 39 patients had not received any therapy for a median of 50 months (range, 11-139 months). Analysis by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in 78 patients during complete cytogenetic response showed 46 who had achieved at least 1 complete molecular response. Five of these 78 patients had died by the time of last follow-up, but only 2 had died of disease-specific causes. Recurrence rates were significantly lower and cytogenetic response durations were significantly longer among patients who achieved at least one complete molecular response. Achieving a complete cytogenetic or molecular response after therapy with interferon-alpha appears to be associated with excellent long-term prognosis. Approximately 10% of patients reportedly can achieve durable complete cytogenetic response, with or without continuation of interferon.

Persistence of malignant hematopoietic progenitors in chronic myelogenous leukemia patients in complete cytogenetic remission following imatinib mesylate treatment.,Blood,Blood,2003-02-06,"The BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, STI571; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) has shown remarkable efficacy in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), with a high proportion of patients achieving complete cytogenetic responses (CCRs). However, it is not clear whether remissions will be durable and whether imatinib mesylate can eliminate the malignant primitive progenitors in which the disease arises. We investigated whether residual BCR/ABL+ hematopoietic progenitors were present in patients who achieved CCRs with imatinib mesylate treatment. CD34+ progenitor cells were selected from bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNCs) and analyzed for the presence of the BCR/ABL fusion gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). CD34+ cells were also plated in committed progenitor (colony-forming cell, or CFC) and primitive progenitor (long-term bone marrow culture-initiating cell, or LTCIC) cultures and resulting colonies analyzed for the presence of BCR/ABL+ cells by FISH. Using these assays, residual BCR/ABL+ progenitors were detected in all patients studied. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis demonstrated increased levels of BCR/ABL mRNA in CD34+ cells compared with total MNCs.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia shapes host immunity by selective deletion of high-avidity leukemia-specific T cells.,The Journal of clinical investigation,J. Clin. Invest.,2003-03-01,"We have shown that cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for PR1, an HLA-A2-restricted nonopeptide derived from proteinase 3, kill leukemia cells and may contribute to the elimination of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) after treatment with IFN or allogeneic bone marrow transplant. Some patients with persistent disease also have circulating PR1-specific T cells, however, suggesting the likelihood of immune tolerance. Here we show that both high- and low-avidity PR1-specific T cells from the peripheral blood of healthy donors can be identified and selectively expanded in vitro. Although high-avidity PR1-specific T cells killed CML more effectively than low-avidity T cells, only high-avidity T cells underwent apoptosis when stimulated with high PR1 peptide concentration or when exposed to leukemia that overexpressed proteinase 3. No high-avidity PR1-specific T cells could be identified or expanded from newly diagnosed leukemia patients, whereas low-avidity T cells were readily expanded. Circulating high-avidity PR1-specific T cells were identified in IFN-sensitive patients in cytogenetic remission, however. These results provide evidence that CML shapes the host immune response and that leukemia outgrowth may result in part from leukemia-induced selective deletion of high-avidity PR1-specific T cells.",Journal Article,6170.0,173.0,We have shown that cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for PR1 an HLA-A2-restricted nonopeptide derived from proteinase 3 kill cells and may contribute to the elimination of chronic myelogenous CML after treatment with IFN or allogeneic marrow transplant Some patients with persistent disease also have circulating PR1-specific T cells however suggesting the likelihood of immune tolerance Here we show that both high- and low-avidity PR1-specific T cells from the peripheral blood of healthy donors can be identified and selectively expanded in vitro Although high-avidity PR1-specific T cells killed CML more effectively than low-avidity T cells only high-avidity T cells underwent apoptosis when stimulated with high PR1 peptide concentration or when exposed to that overexpressed proteinase 3 No high-avidity PR1-specific T cells could be identified or expanded from newly diagnosed patients whereas low-avidity T cells were readily expanded Circulating high-avidity PR1-specific T cells were identified in IFN-sensitive patients in cytogenetic remission however These results provide evidence that CML shapes the host immune response and that outgrowth may result in part from leukemia-induced selective deletion of high-avidity PR1-specific T cells,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 47, 443, 17, 759, 102, 1594, 112, 9, 6298, 35, 1160, 4099, 2016, 53397, 526, 29, 10974, 27, 5097, 37, 2, 68, 1248, 6, 3, 3730, 1, 442, 2194, 903, 50, 24, 5, 1256, 15, 1063, 581, 941, 476, 7, 5, 1882, 34, 120, 47, 1033, 6298, 112, 102, 37, 137, 802, 3, 1420, 1, 250, 2614, 467, 21, 514, 17, 110, 64, 2, 154, 6071, 6298, 112, 102, 37, 29, 3, 672, 315, 1, 1331, 2344, 122, 40, 108, 2, 2382, 2064, 4, 439, 242, 64, 6071, 6298, 112, 102, 37, 8239, 903, 80, 1856, 76, 154, 6071, 102, 37, 158, 64, 6071, 102, 37, 208, 351, 198, 2816, 5, 64, 6298, 1389, 1227, 15, 198, 2234, 6, 17, 1711, 10974, 27, 77, 64, 6071, 6298, 112, 102, 37, 359, 40, 108, 15, 2064, 29, 732, 265, 7, 547, 154, 6071, 102, 37, 11, 3860, 2064, 1033, 64, 6071, 6298, 112, 102, 37, 11, 108, 4, 1256, 745, 7, 4, 1266, 734, 137, 46, 99, 377, 241, 17, 903, 14475, 3, 1204, 250, 51, 2, 17, 7201, 68, 757, 4, 760, 29, 2647, 277, 1094, 1528, 1, 64, 6071, 6298, 112, 102, 37]",1251.0,12618518,20

Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias: from basic mechanisms to molecular therapeutics.,Annals of internal medicine,Ann. Intern. Med.,2003-05-01,"The Philadelphia chromosome translocation (t(9;22)) results in the molecular juxtaposition of two genes, BCR and ABL, to form an aberrant BCR-ABL gene on chromosome 22. BCR-ABL is critical to the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia and a subset of acute leukemias. The chimeric Bcr-Abl protein has constitutively elevated tyrosine phosphokinase activity. This abnormal enzymatic activation is critical to the oncogenic potential of Bcr-Abl. Initially, protein kinases were thought to be poor therapeutic targets because of their ubiquitous nature and crucial role in many normal physiologic processes. However, the advent of imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland), formerly known as STI571 and CGP57148B, demonstrated that designer kinase inhibitors could be specific. This agent has shown striking activity in chronic myelogenous leukemia. It also inhibits phosphorylation of Kit (stem-cell factor receptor) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. In addition, it has shown similar impressive responses, with little host toxicity, in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, which harbor activating Kit mutations, and in tumors with activated platelet-derived growth factor receptor. The studies of imatinib mesylate provide proof-of-principle for using aberrant kinases as a therapeutic target and are a model for the promise of molecular therapeutics.

Long-term follow-up of T cell-depleted allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in refractory multiple myeloma: importance of allogeneic T cells.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2003-05-01,"Multiple myeloma may be cured by myeloablative conditioning and allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation (alloBMT), but this occurs at the expense of high transplant-related mortality. In an endeavor to reduce procedure-related toxicity, this study retrospectively evaluated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of T cell depletion by counterflow centrifugal elutriation before alloBMT. Fifty-one patients with stage II (6) or III (45) multiple myeloma received alloBMTs using T cell depletion by elutriation. Fifty-three percent (27 of 51) of patients had primary refractory disease at the time of transplantation, 10% (5 of 51) had relapsed disease, and 4% (2 of 51) had refractory relapsed disease. The median age was 49 (range, 32 to 62) years, and the median time from diagnosis to transplantation was 9 (range, 4 to 58) months. Patients had received a median of 1 (range, 1 to 3) regimen and 4 (range, 2 to 16) cycles of chemotherapy. In this population, transplant-related mortality rate was 24% (12 of 51) with 2 patients dying of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Thirty-one of 39 evaluable patients have experienced relapse, and the probability of progression-free survival 5 years after alloBMT alone is 16%. Sixteen patients were given donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) at the time of relapse (n = 11) or for persistent disease 1 year after transplantation (n = 5). Acute or chronic GVHD was seen in 63% (10 of 16) of patients given DLI. Responses were seen in 8 of 16 patients (6 complete response [CR], 2 partial response [PR]) with 6 of 8 responding patients having GVHD. Five recipients of DLI remain in a continuous CR, ranging from 3 to 64 months in duration. Thus, like chronic myelogenous leukemia, allogeneic T cells appear to have potent antimyeloma activity that is critical for achieving a cure. DLI-induced remissions of multiple myeloma can be durable, even in patients with refractory multiple myeloma.

Molecular mechanisms of transformation by the BCR-ABL oncogene.,Seminars in hematology,Semin. Hematol.,2003-04-01,"The BCR-ABL oncogene is generated by the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) translocation, fusing the BCR gene to the ABL gene. The BCR-ABL fusion protein has elevated ABL tyrosine kinase activity that is critical for transformation of hematopoietic cells. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells transformed by BCR-ABL show reduced growth factor requirements and apoptosis, as well as enhanced viability and altered adhesion. The elevated ABL kinase activity leads to chronic activation of signaling pathways that are required for all aspects of transformation. Progression of the disease from chronic phase to blast crisis correlates with additional cytogenetic alterations that are likely to contribute to the failure of traditional therapy.

Results of decitabine (5-aza-2'deoxycytidine) therapy in 130 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2003-08-01,"General and site-specific DNA methylation is associated with tumor progression and resistance in several cancers, including chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent that has shown encouraging preliminary anti-CML activity. This study evaluated the activity and toxicity of decitabine in different phases of CML. One hundred and thirty patients with CML were treated: 123 with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive CML (64 blastic, 51 accelerated, 8 chronic) and 7 with Ph-negative CML. Decitabine was given at 100 mg/m(2) over 6 hours every 12 hours x 5 days (1000 mg/m(2) per course) in the first 13 patients, 75 mg/m(2) in the subsequent 33 patients, and 50 mg/m(2) in the remaining 84 patients. A total of 552 courses were given to the 130 patients. Only four patients (3%) died during the first course from myelosuppressive complications (three patients) or progressive disease (one patient). Of 64 patients in the CML blastic phase, 18 patients (28%) achieved objective responses. Of these 18 patients, 6 achieved complete hematologic responses (CHR), 2 achieved partial hematologic responses (PHR), 7 achieved hematologic improvements (HI), and 3 returned to the second chronic phase (second CP). Five patients (8%) had cytogenetic responses. Among 51 patients in the accelerated phase, 28 patients (55%) achieved objective responses (12 CHR, 10 PHR, 3 HI, and 3 second CP). Seven patients (14%) had cytogenetic responses. Among eight patients treated in the chronic phase, five (63%) had objective responses. Of seven patients treated for Ph-negative CML, four (57%) had objective responses. There was no evidence of a dose-response effect.

"Expression of c-ABL, c-KIT, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta in ovarian serous carcinoma and normal ovarian surface epithelium.",Cancer,Cancer,2003-08-01,"Tyrosine kinases, such as c-KIT, c-ABL, and platelet-derived growth factor-beta (PDGFR-beta), are important regulators of cell growth. Highly potent and selective inhibitors of tyrosine kinases are being investigated as alternatives to standard chemotherapy. One such inhibitor, imatinib mesylate, is being used to treat gastrointestinal stromal tumors and chronic myelogenous leukemia. Ovarian carcinomas frequently develop resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Immunohistochemical expression of c-ABL, PDGFR-beta, and c-KIT was evaluated in ovarian carcinomas to determine whether treatment with imatinib mesylate might be feasible. The expression of c-ABL, c-KIT, and PDGFR-beta in tumors was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis of 52 ovarian serous carcinomas, including 21 low-grade (well differentiated) and 31 high-grade (poorly differentiated) tumors. Fourteen normal ovaries were also evaluated. In normal ovarian surface epithelium, c-ABL was expressed universally. PDGFR-beta was expressed in the majority (93%) of samples of normal ovarian epithelium, whereas the c-KIT protein was undetectable in normal ovarian surface epithelium. Overall, c-ABL was expressed in 71% of serous carcinomas. c-ABL was expressed more frequently in the low-grade serous carcinomas (81%) compared with the high-grade serous carcinomas (65%). PDGFR-beta expression was observed in 81% of serous carcinomas overall and was observed more frequently in higher-grade tumors. c-KIT immunohistochemical staining was absent in low-grade tumors but was present in 26% of high-grade serous carcinomas.

Emergence of resistance to IM warrants the exploration of novel well-tolerated anticancer agents. We intended to evaluate the effect of PS-341 on proliferation, survival, and cellular events in Bcr/Abl-positive cells sensitive and resistant to IM, and to investigate the effect of PS-341 and IM in conjunction. Bcr/Abl-positive cell lines sensitive (p210Bcr/Abl KBM5, p210Bcr/Abl KBM7, and p190Bcr/Abl Z-119) or resistant (KBM5-R) to IM were treated with PS-341 alone or in combination with IM. The effect on cell growth was determined using the MTT assay. Cell-cycle analysis was performed by propidium iodide staining. Apoptosis was evaluated by measurement of sub-G1 DNA content, annexin V binding, and caspase 3 activity assays. Levels of apoptotic proteins, P-IkBalpha, Bcr/Abl, and phosphorylated Bcr/Abl were determined by western blotting. NF-kappaB activity was evaluated by electromobility gel shift assays. PS-341 exerted growth inhibition effects in IM-sensitive and -resistant cells. This phenomenon correlated with accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of cell cycle; transient downregulation of NFkappaB DNA binding activity; downregulation of Bcl-xL; activation of caspase 3, induction of apoptosis; inhibition of expression and phosphorylation of Bcr/Abl. Sequential combination of PS-341 followed by IM demonstrated a synergistic pro-apoptotic effect in IM-sensitive cells; concomitant exposure was antagonistic.

The goals of the current study were to evaluate the efficacy of the triple combination regimen with IFN-alpha, ara-C, and HHT in newly diagnosed Ph-positive CML and to assess the impact of the added sequential therapy with imatinib on overall prognosis. Ninety patients with Ph-positive CML in early chronic phase received the triple regimen. Therapy consisted of 5 million units (MU)/m(2) IFN-alpha subcutaneously (s.c. daily, ara-C 10 mg s.c. daily, and HHT 2.5 mg/m(2) by continuous infusion over 24 hours daily x 5 every month. After a median duration of 16.5 months of therapy, 78 patients had their therapy changed to 400 mg orally administered imatinib daily. With the triple regimen, 85 patients (94%) achieved complete hematologic response and 67 patients (74%) had a cytogenetic response (Ph suppression to < or = 90%) which was complete (Ph 0%) in 20 patients (22%) and major in 42 patients (46%). Myelosuppression was significant, resulting in considerable reductions in the dose schedules. After 12 months of therapy, the median IFN-alpha dose was 1.6 MU/m(2) daily, the median ara-C dose was 1.85 mg daily, and the median number of HHT days was 2 every month. Only three patients developed blastic phase while receiving the triple regimen. With the change to imatinib therapy, currently 57 patients (63%) are in complete cytogenetic response and 69 patients (76%) in major cytogenetic response. With a median follow-up time of 46 months for the total study group, the estimated 5-year survival rate was 88%, and only 8 patients (9%) to date have developed blastic phase. The sequence of IFN-alpha, ara-C, and HHT followed by imatinib (imposed by the discovery of the latter drug) resulted in an estimated 5-year survival rate of 88%.

Effects of age on prognosis with imatinib mesylate therapy for patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2003-09-01,"Older age is a consistent poor prognostic factor in patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Whether this is related to an intrinsic worse disease biology or to inadequate drug delivery or excessive treatment-associated toxicity is unknown. The availability of imatinib mesylate, a selective, Bcr-Abl-targeted therapy that is administered orally with minimal side effects, may clarify whether older age would remain an adverse factor (thus, implying a different age-related CML biology). Seven hundred forty-seven patients in different phases of Ph-positive CML who were treated with imatinib from 1999 until the time of last follow-up were evaluated. Among them, 187 patients had newly diagnosed, early chronic phase CML; 351 patients had chronic phase CML after interferon alpha (IFN) failure; 133 patients had accelerated phase CML; and 76 patients had blastic phase CML. The imatinib daily dose varied from 400 mg to 800 mg orally, according to the protocol design. Patients were categorized into a group of older patients (age 60 years or older) or younger patients (age younger than 60 years). Their characteristics, responses to therapy, and survival were compared by univariate and multivariate analyses. One hundred eighty-seven patients had newly diagnosed CML, and 49 patients (26%) were in the older age group. Older patients had similar cytogenetic response rates and survival compared with younger patients. Among 351 patients with late chronic phase CML after IFN failure, 120 patients (34%) were in the older age group. Although the older patients had a lower incidence of achievement of complete cytogenetic response (Ph, 0%) by univariate analysis (56% vs. 44%; P = 0.05), age was not found to be an independent poor prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis. Similarly, older age was not an adverse poor prognostic factor for survival. Forty-two of 133 patients (32%) with accelerated phase CML were older. The incidence of any cytogenetic response was lower in older patients (53% vs. 33%; P = 0.04), but age was not significant in the multivariate analysis. Older patients also had a trend toward worse survival (P = 0.09) that was not significant in the multivariate analysis. Twenty-eight of 76 patients (37%) evaluated in blastic phase were older. Older age was not a significant prognostic factor either for achieving response or for survival. With imatinib therapy, older age appears to have lost much of its prognostic relevance. This suggests that the previous poor prognosis observed with older age was related to treatment-associated factors (e.g., toxicity with allogeneic transplantation or with IFN therapy) rather than to an intrinsic, different disease biology of CML in older patients.",Journal Article,5986.0,74.0,Older age is a consistent poor prognostic factor in patients with Philadelphia chromosome Ph -positive

In 14 of 14 patients, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and/or CD4 proliferative responses developed after beginning vaccinations, and 11 of 14 patients showed interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) release by CD4 enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) at one or more time points. These responses were CD4(+)CD45RO(+). A peptide-specific CD8(+) interferon-gamma ELISPOT was found in 4 patients. Four patients in hematologic remission had a decrease in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) percentage (3 concurrently receiving interferon-alpha and 1 on imatinib mesylate), and 3 patients in molecular relapse after allogenic transplantation became transiently polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative after vaccination; 2 of these patients received concurrent donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). All 5 patients on IFN-alpha ultimately reached a complete cytogenetic remission. In conclusion, a tumor-specific bcr-abl breakpoint peptide-derived vaccine can be safely administered and can reliably elicit measurable peptide-specific CD4 immune responses, including in patients after bone marrow transplantation, on interferon, or on imatinib mesylate.

Analysis of the impact of imatinib mesylate therapy on the prognosis of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with interferon-alpha regimens for early chronic phase.,Cancer,Cancer,2003-10-01,"The effect on prognosis of adding imatinib mesylate to the treatment of patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) has not been explored fully. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the benefit of adding imatinib to the treatment sequence of patients with early chronic phase Ph-positive CML who received interferon alpha (IFN)-based regimens as frontline therapy. A total of 201 patients with early chronic phase Ph-positive CML who were treated on our 3 recent frontline IFN-based programs and were impacted early by the availability of sequential therapy with imatinib were analyzed. Their outcome was compared with that of a historical control group of 293 patients treated from 1982 until 1990 who were treated with IFN programs for early chronic phase CML and who did not have the opportunity of early access to imatinib (because it was not available during that period). Multivariate analysis was used to evaluate the independent effect of imatinib therapy on survival. Of 201 patients who were treated, 159 patients (79%) had their regimen changed sequentially to imatinib after a median duration of 14 months of IFN therapy. Of 139 patients who continued evaluation at our institution, 101 patients (73%; 64% of the total group) achieved a complete cytogenetic response, and 20 of 80 patients analyzed (25%; 10% of the total group) had no disease according to molecular studies (quantitative polymerase chain reaction studies). The estimated 5-year survival rate for the total study group of 201 patients was 86%. Survival of this group was significantly superior to the historic control group of IFN-treated patients who did not have the benefit of imatinib (P = 0.03). The trend also was observed within defined CML risk groups. Imatinib therapy was confirmed as an independent, significant, favorable prognostic factor for survival by multivariate analysis, after accounting for the independent prognostic effect of pretreatment prognostic factors (P = 0.005). The current analysis is the first to indicate the independent, favorable effect of imatinib on the survival of patients with Ph-positive CML.",Comparative Study,5956.0,18.0,The effect on prognosis of adding imatinib mesylate to the treatment of patients with Philadelphia chromosome Ph -positive chronic myelogenous CML has not been explored fully The objective of the current study was to evaluate the benefit of adding imatinib to the treatment sequence of patients with early chronic phase Ph-positive CML who received interferon alpha IFN -based regimens as frontline therapy A total of 201 patients with early chronic phase Ph-positive CML who were treated on our 3 recent frontline IFN-based programs and were impacted early by the availability of sequential therapy with imatinib were analyzed Their outcome was compared with that of a historical control group of 293 patients treated from 1982 until 1990 who were treated with IFN programs for early chronic phase CML and who did not have the opportunity of early access to imatinib because it was not available during that period Multivariate analysis was used to evaluate the independent effect of imatinib therapy on survival Of 201 patients who were treated 159 patients 79 had their regimen changed sequentially to imatinib after a median duration of 14 months of IFN therapy Of 139 patients who continued evaluation at our institution 101 patients 73 64 of the total group achieved a complete cytogenetic response and 20 of 80 patients analyzed 25 10 of the total group had no disease according to molecular studies quantitative polymerase chain reaction studies The estimated 5-year survival rate for the total study group of 201 patients was 86 Survival of this group was significantly superior to the historic control group of IFN-treated patients who did not have the benefit of imatinib P 0.03 The trend also was observed within defined CML risk groups Imatinib therapy was confirmed as an independent significant favorable prognostic factor for survival by multivariate analysis after accounting for the independent prognostic effect of pretreatment prognostic factors P 0.005 The current analysis is the first to indicate the independent favorable effect of imatinib on the survival of patients with Ph-positive CML,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 254, 23, 356, 1, 2726, 577, 2347, 6, 3, 24, 1, 7, 5, 3006, 1170, 2058, 109, 442, 2194, 903, 71, 44, 85, 1443, 1910, 3, 461, 1, 3, 291, 45, 10, 6, 376, 3, 247, 1, 2726, 577, 6, 3, 24, 1532, 1, 7, 5, 191, 442, 124, 2058, 109, 903, 54, 103, 1688, 950, 1256, 90, 472, 22, 3171, 36, 8, 181, 1, 4766, 7, 5, 191, 442, 124, 2058, 109, 903, 54, 11, 73, 23, 114, 27, 435, 3171, 1256, 90, 2251, 2, 11, 4619, 191, 20, 3, 2550, 1, 1787, 36, 5, 577, 11, 311, 136, 228, 10, 72, 5, 17, 1, 8, 2252, 182, 87, 1, 7541, 7, 73, 29, 6652, 1100, 2289, 54, 11, 73, 5, 1256, 2251, 9, 191, 442, 124, 903, 2, 54, 205, 44, 47, 3, 2666, 1, 191, 1655, 6, 577, 408, 192, 10, 44, 390, 190, 17, 727, 331, 65, 10, 95, 6, 376, 3, 306, 254, 1, 577, 36, 23, 25, 1, 4766, 7, 54, 11, 73, 5917, 7, 842, 42, 136, 477, 2368, 5455, 6, 577, 50, 8, 52, 654, 1, 213, 53, 1, 1256, 36, 1, 4929, 7, 54, 1351, 451, 28, 114, 731, 2338, 7, 803, 660, 1, 3, 181, 87, 513, 8, 236, 1266, 51, 2, 179, 1, 493, 7, 311, 243, 79, 1, 3, 181, 87, 42, 77, 34, 768, 6, 219, 94, 1156, 1451, 1260, 1329, 94, 3, 661, 33, 111, 25, 116, 9, 3, 181, 45, 87, 1, 4766, 7, 10, 868, 25, 1, 26, 87, 10, 97, 1123, 6, 3, 6875, 182, 87, 1, 1256, 73, 7, 54, 205, 44, 47, 3, 247, 1, 577, 19, 13, 680, 3, 853, 120, 10, 164, 262, 395, 903, 43, 271, 577, 36, 10, 557, 22, 35, 306, 93, 913, 177, 161, 9, 25, 20, 331, 65, 50, 3116, 9, 3, 306, 177, 254, 1, 1194, 177, 130, 19, 13, 1614, 3, 291, 65, 16, 3, 157, 6, 1008, 3, 306, 913, 254, 1, 577, 23, 3, 25, 1, 7, 5, 2058, 109, 903]",2113.0,14508830,253
Chromosomal abnormalities in Philadelphia chromosome-negative metaphases appearing during imatinib mesylate therapy in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase.,Cancer,Cancer,2003-11-01,"Anecdotal cases of chromosomal abnormalities in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative metaphases have been reported in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in the chronic phase during treatment with interferon and, more recently, with imatinib. This phenomenon is different from true clonal evolution in that the additional cytogenetic abnormality occurs in Ph-negative cells. The authors analyzed their experience with 342 patients with CML in chronic phase treated with imatinib to investigate the frequency and significance of this event. After a median follow-up of 30 months (range, 16-35 months), 21 patients (6%; 95% confidence interval, 0.04, 0.09) developed 25 chromosomal abnormalities in Ph-negative cells. Thirteen (54%) of these abnormalities were seen in 2 or more metaphases. The median time from the start of treatment with imatinib to the appearance of the abnormalities was 6 months (range, 3-22 months). The most common cytogenetic abnormality detected was trisomy 8 (33%). Twenty of 21 patients (95%) achieved a major (Ph < 35%) cytogenetic response (complete cytogenetic response in 13-62%). After a median follow-up of 22 months (range, 4-33 months), all 21 patients were alive, 20 of them in chronic phase and in complete hematologic response.

Phase 1 study of low-dose prolonged exposure schedules of the hypomethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) in hematopoietic malignancies.,Blood,Blood,2003-11-06,"Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) inhibits DNA methylation and has dual effects on neoplastic cells, including the reactivation of silenced genes and differentiation at low doses and cytotoxicity at high doses. We evaluated, in a phase 1 study, low-dose prolonged exposure schedules of decitabine in relapsed/refractory leukemias. Patient cohorts received decitabine at 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg/m2 intravenously over one hour daily, 5 days a week for 2 consecutive weeks, doses 5- to approximately 30-fold lower than the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). There were 2 groups that also received 15 mg/m2 daily for 15 or 20 days. A total of 50 patients were treated (44 with acute myelogenous leukemia [AML]/myelodysplasia [MDS], 5 with chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML], and 1 with acute lymphocytic leukemia [ALL]), and the drug was well tolerated at all dose levels, with myelosuppression being the major side effect. Responses were seen at all dose levels.

Linking molecular diagnostics to molecular therapeutics: targeting the PI3K pathway in breast cancer.,Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2003-10-01,"Modulation of the signaling pathways that are aberrant in cancer cells has the potential to provide an effective nontoxic approach to patient management in a broad range of cancers. This quest has taken a major leap forward with the demonstration that STI-571 (imatinib mesylate) induces clinical and molecular remissions in the majority of patients with interferon-refractory chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors through inhibition of the Bcr/Abl fusion protein required for the initiation and progression of chronic myelogenous leukemia and inhibition of a mutant, activated c-kit present in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Support for the concept of targeting products of fusion genes found in specific cancers was first provided by the efficacy of all-trans retinoic acid in acute promyelocytic leukemia where the RARalpha all-trans retinoic acid target is the target of multiple different chromosomal rearrangements. In breast cancer, trastuzumab, which alters the function of the HER2 proto-oncogene overexpressed in a portion of breast cancers, provides an additional example of targeting specific molecular aberrations present in cancer cells. Although the target for these signal transduction modulators is functional in normal cells, acceptable therapeutic indices sufficient to prevent tumor growth without unacceptable toxicities have been observed. Whether STI-571 and other signal transduction modulators also target the stroma, and specifically the neovasculature, in addition to the tumor remains an open question. The presence of the target in the cancer cells or in the surrounding stroma appears to be required but not sufficient for the action of molecular therapeutics. Thus, linking molecular diagnostics to identify patients where the target is amplified or activated and driving the pathophysiology of the patients' tumor to effective molecular therapeutics will be necessary to translate these concepts into approaches that will alter the outcome for breast cancer patients. This review will focus on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and novel molecules targeting this pathway to illustrate the questions and challenges underlying the implementation of molecular therapeutics in breast cancer.",Journal Article,5956.0,46.0,Modulation of the signaling pathways that are aberrant in cancer cells has the potential to provide an effective nontoxic approach to patient management in a broad range of cancers This quest has taken a major leap forward with the demonstration that STI-571 imatinib mesylate induces clinical and molecular remissions in the majority of patients with interferon-refractory chronic myelogenous and stromal tumors through inhibition of the Bcr/Abl fusion protein required for the initiation and progression of chronic myelogenous and inhibition of a mutant activated c-kit present in stromal tumors Support for the concept of targeting products of fusion genes found in specific cancers was first provided by the efficacy of all-trans retinoic acid in acute promyelocytic where the RARalpha all-trans retinoic acid target is the target of multiple different chromosomal rearrangements In cancer trastuzumab which alters the function of the HER2 proto-oncogene overexpressed in a portion of cancers provides an additional example of targeting specific molecular aberrations present in cancer cells Although the target for these signal transduction modulators is functional in normal cells acceptable therapeutic indices sufficient to prevent tumor growth without unacceptable toxicities have been observed Whether STI-571 and other signal transduction modulators also target the stroma and specifically the neovasculature in addition to the tumor remains an open question The presence of the target in the cancer cells or in the surrounding stroma appears to be required but not sufficient for the action of molecular therapeutics Thus linking molecular diagnostics to identify patients where the target is amplified or activated and driving the pathophysiology of the patients tumor to effective molecular therapeutics will be necessary to translate these concepts into approaches that will alter the outcome for cancer patients This review will focus on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and novel molecules targeting this pathway to illustrate the questions and challenges underlying the implementation of molecular therapeutics in cancer,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2356, 1, 3, 314, 460, 17, 32, 1898, 4, 12, 37, 71, 3, 174, 6, 377, 35, 323, 10535, 353, 6, 69, 284, 4, 8, 2094, 184, 1, 163, 26, 19439, 71, 1633, 8, 458, 33552, 4674, 5, 3, 6533, 17, 10640, 7846, 577, 2347, 1516, 38, 2, 219, 3166, 4, 3, 686, 1, 7, 5, 1688, 430, 442, 2194, 2, 1126, 57, 298, 297, 1, 3, 1062, 1425, 1212, 178, 616, 9, 3, 1118, 2, 91, 1, 442, 2194, 2, 297, 1, 8, 620, 735, 256, 1164, 364, 4, 1126, 57, 538, 9, 3, 2545, 1, 529, 2766, 1, 1212, 214, 204, 4, 112, 163, 10, 157, 1052, 20, 3, 209, 1, 62, 3437, 3887, 971, 4, 286, 4300, 1257, 3, 10412, 62, 3437, 3887, 971, 283, 16, 3, 283, 1, 232, 338, 1860, 2072, 4, 12, 769, 92, 6745, 3, 343, 1, 3, 354, 4976, 1836, 1711, 4, 8, 3206, 1, 163, 777, 35, 402, 2685, 1, 529, 112, 219, 2152, 364, 4, 12, 37, 242, 3, 283, 9, 46, 1235, 2761, 5014, 16, 583, 4, 295, 37, 1595, 189, 3824, 1952, 6, 1682, 30, 129, 187, 3215, 385, 47, 85, 164, 317, 10640, 7846, 2, 127, 1235, 2761, 5014, 120, 283, 3, 2477, 2, 1225, 3, 12136, 4, 352, 6, 3, 30, 469, 35, 1020, 2840, 3, 463, 1, 3, 283, 4, 3, 12, 37, 15, 4, 3, 2976, 2477, 1233, 6, 40, 616, 84, 44, 1952, 9, 3, 1578, 1, 219, 1943, 631, 5806, 219, 5197, 6, 255, 7, 1257, 3, 283, 16, 2429, 15, 735, 2, 4057, 3, 4320, 1, 3, 7, 30, 6, 323, 219, 1943, 303, 40, 1493, 6, 4509, 46, 5101, 237, 611, 17, 303, 2688, 3, 228, 9, 12, 7, 26, 206, 303, 1222, 23, 3, 3415, 27, 216, 308, 2, 229, 1598, 529, 26, 308, 6, 4746, 3, 1937, 2, 1427, 1181, 3, 2393, 1, 219, 1943, 4, 12]",2147.0,14613030,42

Imatinib mesylate therapy improves survival in patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia in the chronic phase: comparison with historic data.,Cancer,Cancer,2003-12-01,"The International Randomized study of Interferon-alpha plus cytarabine (IFN-alpha plus ara-C) versus STI571 (imatinib mesylate) [IRIS trial] in patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive, chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) has not shown (to date) a survival advantage for imatinib. This was most likely because approximately 90% of patients receiving IFN-alpha plus ara-C changed to imatinib therapy after a median of 8 months into therapy. The authors analyzed the results with imatinib therapy in patients with newly diagnosed Ph-positive CML in chronic phase and compared their outcome with patients who received IFN-alpha regimens.

Imatinib mesylate in Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia of childhood.,Cancer,Cancer,2003-12-01,"Initial treatment for adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph[+]) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) now includes imatinib mesylate. However, to our knowledge, there are few data regarding imatinib safety, efficacy, and response monitoring in patients age < 18 years. In the current series, the authors report 5 consecutive patients ages 20 months to 12 years with Ph+ leukemia who were treated with imatinib and evaluated for a response using cytogenetics, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on serial bone marrow aspirations. Doses of imatinib were escalated as tolerated from a starting dose of 400 mg/m2 (patients with a body surface area [BSA] < 1 m2) or 400 mg/day (patients with a BSA > 1 m2). After the initiation of imatinib therapy, all 4 patients with CML were found to have no detectable Ph chromosome by cytogenetics (median of 198 days of imatinib therapy; range, 138-346 days), FISH (median of 285 days of imatinib therapy; range, 138-366 days), and real-time RT-PCR (median of 287 days of imatinib therapy; range, 224-366 days). One patient with Ph+ acute mixed lineage leukemia achieved a morphologic disease remission with standard chemotherapy, but within 10 months had increasing Ph positivity in consecutive bone marrow aspirations. Imatinib was added to the intensive leukemia therapy, and within 26 days there were no detectable Ph+ cells in the bone marrow.

The outcome of 261 patients with Ph-positive chronic phase CML post-IFN failure treated with imatinib was compared with 204 historical control patients treated for a similar disease status with existing therapies. A subset of 147 patients in late chronic phase CML and 100% Ph-positive status treated with imatinib was compared with 95 patients in a similar disease status treated with IFN. Multivariate analyses were conducted to assess the independent prognostic effect of therapy (imatinib versus other) on survival. In the first analysis involving 261 patients on imatinib plus 204 historical patients, the complete cytogenetic response rates were 62% and 19%, respectively (P < 0.001). A multivariate analysis identified pretreatment peripheral blasts and thrombocytosis to be independent poor prognostic factors for survival.

Aminopeptidase inhibitors inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of K562 and STI571-resistant K562 cell lines through the MAPK and GSK-3beta pathways.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2003-11-01,"A tyrosine kinase inhibitor, STI571, has been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). STI571 inhibits tyrosine kinase activity of ABL and induces apoptosis of CML cells. However, drug resistance develops commonly in patients with blast phase CML, and has become a significant therapeutic problem. We examined the effects of aminopeptidase inhibitors on CML cell line (K562) and a STI571-resistant subline of K562. Ubenimex and the more potent aminopeptidase inhibitor, actinonin, inhibited proliferation of both K562 cells and STI571-resistant K562 cells and also induced their apoptosis in dose- and time-dependent manners. Ubenimex and actinonin induced the activation of caspase-3, and the induction of apoptosis was inhibited by pan-caspase inhibitor, indicating this apoptosis is caspase-dependent.

The tumor antigen (TAG) genes are also expressed in K562, a myelogenous leukemia cell line, and they have homology to two chronic myelogenous leukemia-derived clones and a hepatocellular carcinoma clone in the human expressed sequence tags (EST) database, thus indicating that their expression is not restricted to melanomas. In contrast to the fact that many cancer/testis antigens are poorly immunogenic, the TAG-derived peptide, RLSNRLLLR, is recognized by HLA-A3-restricted, melanoma-specific CTLs that were obtained from a melanoma patient with spontaneous reactivity to the peptide. Unlike most cancer/testis antigen genes which are located on the X chromosome, the TAG genes are located on chromosome 5. The genes have the additional unusual features of being coded for in an open reading frame that is initiated by one of three nonstandard initiation codons, and the sequence coding the RLSNRLLLR peptide crosses an exon-exon boundary.

Combination of rapamycin and protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors for the treatment of leukemias caused by oncogenic PTKs.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2004-02-19,"Abnormal protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) cause many human leukemias. For example, BCR/ABL causes chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), whereas FLT3 mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of acute myelogenous leukemia. The ABL inhibitor Imatinib (Gleevec, STI571) has remarkable efficacy for treating chronic phase CML, and FLT3 inhibitors (e.g., PKC412) show similar promise in preclinical studies. However, resistance to PTK inhibitors is a major emerging problem that may limit long-term therapeutic efficacy. Development of rational combination therapies will probably be required to effect cures of these and other neoplastic disorders. Here, we report that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin synergizes with Imatinib against BCR/ABL-transformed myeloid and lymphoid cells and increases survival in a murine CML model. Rapamycin/Imatinib combinations also inhibit Imatinib-resistant mutants of BCR/ABL, and rapamycin plus PKC412 synergistically inhibits cells expressing PKC412-sensitive or -resistant leukemogenic FLT3 mutants. Biochemical analyses raise the possibility that inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation may be particularly important for the synergistic effects of PTK inhibitor/rapamycin combinations. Addition of a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor to rapamycin or rapamycin plus PTK inhibitor further increases efficacy. Our results suggest that simultaneous targeting of more than one signaling pathway required by leukemogenic PTKs may improve the treatment of primary and relapsed CML and/or acute myelogenous leukemia caused by FLT3 mutations. Similar strategies may be useful for treating solid tumors associated with mutant and/or overexpressed PTKs.",Journal Article,5815.0,222.0,Abnormal protein tyrosine kinases PTKs cause many human leukemias For example BCR/ABL causes chronic myelogenous CML whereas FLT3 mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of acute myelogenous The ABL inhibitor Imatinib Gleevec STI571 has remarkable efficacy for treating chronic phase CML and FLT3 inhibitors e.g. PKC412 show similar promise in preclinical studies However resistance to PTK inhibitors is a major emerging problem that may limit long-term therapeutic efficacy Development of rational combination therapies will probably be required to effect cures of these and other neoplastic disorders Here we report that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin synergizes with Imatinib against BCR/ABL-transformed myeloid and lymphoid cells and increases survival in a murine CML model Rapamycin/Imatinib combinations also inhibit Imatinib-resistant mutants of BCR/ABL and rapamycin plus PKC412 synergistically inhibits cells expressing PKC412-sensitive or -resistant leukemogenic FLT3 mutants Biochemical analyses raise the possibility that inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation may be particularly important for the synergistic effects of PTK inhibitor/rapamycin combinations Addition of a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor to rapamycin or rapamycin plus PTK inhibitor further increases efficacy Our results suggest that simultaneous targeting of more than one signaling pathway required by leukemogenic PTKs may improve the treatment of primary and relapsed CML and/or acute myelogenous caused by FLT3 mutations Similar strategies may be useful for treating solid tumors associated with mutant and/or overexpressed PTKs,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1668, 178, 564, 1549, 30553, 708, 445, 171, 2792, 9, 2685, 1062, 1425, 1626, 442, 2194, 903, 547, 1224, 138, 1248, 6, 3, 1384, 1, 286, 2194, 3, 1425, 230, 577, 8569, 5735, 71, 3813, 209, 9, 1367, 442, 124, 903, 2, 1224, 222, 563, 499, 7154, 514, 288, 1783, 4, 693, 94, 137, 251, 6, 20351, 222, 16, 8, 458, 1478, 2497, 17, 68, 2385, 319, 337, 189, 209, 193, 1, 2696, 150, 235, 303, 4061, 40, 616, 6, 254, 9154, 1, 46, 2, 127, 2000, 1997, 467, 21, 414, 17, 3, 873, 230, 1620, 10824, 5, 577, 480, 1062, 1425, 2423, 533, 2, 2303, 37, 2, 1106, 25, 4, 8, 1471, 903, 202, 1620, 577, 1247, 120, 1433, 577, 436, 3423, 1, 1062, 1425, 2, 1620, 349, 7154, 4240, 1576, 37, 1046, 7154, 745, 15, 436, 13519, 1224, 3423, 1487, 318, 5008, 3, 2526, 17, 297, 1, 6726, 7949, 982, 68, 40, 823, 305, 9, 3, 1806, 176, 1, 20351, 230, 1620, 1247, 352, 1, 8, 2625, 735, 178, 216, 216, 230, 6, 1620, 15, 1620, 349, 20351, 230, 195, 1106, 209, 114, 99, 309, 17, 2824, 529, 1, 80, 76, 104, 314, 308, 616, 20, 13519, 30553, 68, 401, 3, 24, 1, 86, 2, 591, 903, 2, 15, 286, 2194, 1546, 20, 1224, 138, 288, 422, 68, 40, 999, 9, 1367, 537, 57, 41, 5, 620, 2, 15, 1711, 30553]",1629.0,14976243,21
Bortezomib and flavopiridol interact synergistically to induce apoptosis in chronic myeloid leukemia cells resistant to imatinib mesylate through both Bcr/Abl-dependent and -independent mechanisms.,Blood,Blood,2004-03-23,"Interactions between the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor flavopiridol and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib were examined in Bcr/Abl(+) human leukemia cells. Coexposure of K562 or LAMA84 cells to subtoxic concentration of flavopiridol (150-200 nM) and bortezomib (5-8 nM) resulted in a synergistic increase in mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. These events were associated with a marked diminution in nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)/DNA binding activity; enhanced phosphorylation of SEK1/MKK4 (stress-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-related kinase 1/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); down-regulation of Bcr/Abl; and a marked reduction in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and STAT5 activity. In imatinib mesylate-resistant K562 cells displaying increased Bcr/Abl expression, bortezomib/flavopiridol treatment markedly increased apoptosis in association with down-regulation of Bcr/Abl and BclxL, and diminished phosphorylation of Lyn, Hck, CrkL, and Akt. Parallel studies were performed in imatinib mesylate-resistant LAMA84 cells exhibiting reduced expression of Bcr/Abl but a marked increase in expression/activation of Lyn and Hck. Flavopiridol/bortezomib effectively induced apoptosis in these cells in association with Lyn and Hck inactivation. The capacity of flavopiridol to promote bortezomib-mediated Bcr/Abl down-regulation and apoptosis was mimicked by the positive transcription elongation factor-b (P-TEFb) inhibitor DRB (5,6-dichloro 1-beta-d-ribofuranosylbenzinida-sole). Finally, the bortezomib/flavopiridol regimen also potently induced apoptosis in Bcr/Abl(-) human leukemia cells.

OSI-211 has significant activity in severe combined immunodeficient mouse models of human leukemia. This study was conducted to define the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and pharmacokinetics of OSI-211 in patients with refractory myeloid leukemias. Patients with refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase (CML-BP) were eligible. OSI-211 was given as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes daily for 3 days. The starting dose was 1.5 mg/m2 per day (4.5 mg/m2 per course). The dose was escalated by 50% until Grade 2 toxicity was observed and then by 30-35% until the DLT was defined. Serial plasma and urine samples were collected, and drug levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Twenty patients (18 patients [90%] with AML, and 1 patient each [5%] with MDS and CML-BP) were treated. Mucositis and diarrhea were considered to be the DLTs. The maximum tolerated dose was 3.7 mg/m2 per day. Fourteen of 18 evaluable patients (78%) with AML or MDS achieved transient bone marrow aplasia. The mean systemic clearance of lurtotecan in plasma was 0.946 +/- 1.53 L/hour/m2. Urinary recovery of lurtotecan was 6.66% +/- 5.26% (range, 1.05-18.4%).

Role of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in the generation of the effects of imatinib mesylate (STI571) in BCR-ABL-expressing cells.,The Journal of biological chemistry,J. Biol. Chem.,2004-03-31,"Imatinib mesylate (STI571), a specific inhibitor of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, exhibits potent antileukemic effects in vitro and in vivo. Despite the well established role of STI571 in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, the precise mechanisms by which inhibition of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity results in generation of antileukemic responses remain unknown. In the present study we provide evidence that treatment of CML-derived BCR-ABL-expressing leukemia cells with STI571 results in activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway. Our data indicate that STI571 induces phosphorylation of the p38 and activation of its kinase domain, in KT-1 cells and other BCR-ABL-expressing cell lines. We also identify the kinases MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-2 and Msk1 as two downstream effectors of p38, activated during inhibition of BCR-ABL activity by STI571. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of p38 reverses the growth inhibitory effects of STI571 on primary leukemic colony-forming unit granulocyte/macrophage progenitors from patients with CML. Altogether, our data establish that activation of the p38 MAP kinase signaling cascade plays an important role in the generation of the effects of STI571 on BCR-ABL-expressing cells. They also suggest that, in addition to activation of mitogenic pathways, BCR-ABL promotes leukemogenesis by suppressing the function of growth inhibitory signaling cascades.",Journal Article,5774.0,55.0,Imatinib mesylate STI571 a specific inhibitor of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase exhibits potent antileukemic effects in vitro and in vivo Despite the well established role of STI571 in the treatment of chronic myelogenous the precise mechanisms by which inhibition of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity results in generation of antileukemic responses remain unknown In the present study we provide evidence that treatment of CML-derived BCR-ABL-expressing cells with STI571 results in activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase signaling pathway Our data indicate that STI571 induces phosphorylation of the p38 and activation of its kinase domain in KT-1 cells and other BCR-ABL-expressing cell lines We also identify the kinases MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-2 and Msk1 as two downstream effectors of p38 activated during inhibition of BCR-ABL activity by STI571 Importantly pharmacological inhibition of p38 reverses the growth inhibitory effects of STI571 on primary leukemic colony-forming unit granulocyte/macrophage progenitors from patients with CML Altogether our data establish that activation of the p38 MAP kinase signaling cascade plays an important role in the generation of the effects of STI571 on BCR-ABL-expressing cells They also suggest that in addition to activation of mitogenic pathways BCR-ABL promotes leukemogenesis by suppressing the function of growth inhibitory signaling cascades,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[577, 2347, 5735, 8, 112, 230, 1, 3, 1062, 1425, 564, 216, 4273, 1157, 4512, 176, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 550, 3, 149, 635, 200, 1, 5735, 4, 3, 24, 1, 442, 2194, 3, 3260, 483, 20, 92, 297, 1, 1062, 1425, 564, 216, 128, 99, 4, 914, 1, 4512, 253, 918, 860, 4, 3, 364, 45, 21, 377, 241, 17, 24, 1, 903, 526, 1062, 1425, 1046, 37, 5, 5735, 99, 4, 363, 1, 3, 3970, 2625, 735, 178, 3771, 216, 314, 308, 114, 74, 1008, 17, 5735, 1516, 982, 1, 3, 3970, 2, 363, 1, 211, 216, 1398, 4, 24697, 14, 37, 2, 127, 1062, 1425, 1046, 31, 285, 21, 120, 255, 3, 1549, 3771, 216, 735, 178, 216, 18, 2, 20365, 22, 100, 1489, 4926, 1, 3970, 735, 190, 297, 1, 1062, 1425, 128, 20, 5735, 1859, 3419, 297, 1, 3970, 10984, 3, 129, 1810, 176, 1, 5735, 23, 86, 2015, 1975, 4525, 2712, 2764, 2674, 4321, 29, 7, 5, 903, 6767, 114, 74, 1811, 17, 363, 1, 3, 3970, 3771, 216, 314, 4678, 1698, 35, 305, 200, 4, 3, 914, 1, 3, 176, 1, 5735, 23, 1062, 1425, 1046, 37, 491, 120, 309, 17, 4, 352, 6, 363, 1, 8233, 460, 1062, 1425, 2148, 5661, 20, 4669, 3, 343, 1, 129, 1810, 314, 8036]",1425.0,15056660,140
High-dose imatinib mesylate therapy in newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2003-12-24,"Imatinib mesylate (STI571) is effective in chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, most patients treated with 400 mg imatinib daily have variable levels of residual molecular disease. We treated 114 patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML with 400 mg imatinib twice daily. Overall, 109 patients (96%) had a major cytogenetic response (Philadelphia chromosome [Ph] < 35%), and 103 (90%) had a complete response (Ph 0%). With a median follow-up of 15 months, no patient has progressed to accelerated or blastic phase. The estimated 2-year survival rate was 94%. By quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) studies, 71 (63%) of 112 patients showed BCR-ABL/ABL percentage ratios decrease to less than 0.05%, and 31 (28%) to undetectable levels. Compared with standard-dose imatinib, high-dose imatinib was associated with significantly better complete cytogenetic response (P =.0005), major molecular response (QPRC < 0.05%; P =.00001), and complete molecular response (undetectable BCR-ABL; P =.001). High-dose imatinib was well tolerated but resulted in more frequent myelosuppression; 82% of patients continue to receive 600 mg or more of imatinib daily.

The role of craniospinal irradiation in adults with a central nervous system recurrence of leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2004-05-01,"Although central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis in patients with leukemia has reduced the incidence of CNS disease recurrence, it still is reported to occur in approximately 5-10% of cases, resulting in a median survival of 6 months. Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) has been shown to improve survival in children who develop a CNS recurrence of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). However, to the authors' knowledge, the role of CSI in adults with a CNS recurrence of leukemia is unknown. A retrospective review of adult patients treated with CSI for a CNS recurrence of leukemia identified 16 patients treated between 1986 and 2001. The median age of the patients was 34 years (range, 16-58 years). The diagnoses included seven patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), eight patients with ALL, and one patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis. All patients had achieved a complete disease remission prior to the CNS recurrence. Eleven patients had an isolated CNS recurrence and 5 patients had concurrent disease identified in the blood/bone marrow. The median dose of radiation was 24 grays (Gy) (range, 18-34.5 Gy) to the cranium and 18 Gy (range, 15-30 Gy) to the spine. The median fraction size was 1.8 Gy (range, 1.5-2.0 Gy) to the cranium and 1.5 Gy (range, 1.5-2.0 Gy) to the spine. Fifteen patients were also treated with intrathecal chemotherapy. One patient failed to complete radiation treatment because of disease progression. Thirteen patients achieved a complete response in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The median time to disease progression was 3 months from the first day of CSI and 7 months from CNS recurrence. The median survival was 4 months and 9 months, respectively. No CNS recurrences occurred, but there were 11 bone marrow failures, 2 patients without recurrence at > 5 years, and 3 deaths without a documented site of failure. Thirteen patients had no evidence of disease in the CSF until their death or the time of last follow-up. CSI with or without intrathecal chemotherapy appears to be effective at eliminating leukemia in the craniospinal axis. However, the eradication of disease in the CNS was not found to be effective at preventing disease recurrence in the bone marrow, and despite improved control of disease in the CNS, adult patients with a CNS recurrence still had a poor prognosis.

Granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (filgrastim) may overcome imatinib-induced neutropenia in patients with chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2004-06-01,"Imatinib mesylate administration has become standard treatment for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Although the safety profile of imatinib is favorable, Grade > or = 3 neutropenia (according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria) occurs in 35-45% of patients with CML in chronic phase who receive standard-dose imatinib. Myelosuppression results in treatment interruptions, which may compromise responses to imatinib. The authors investigated the ability of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (filgrastim) to reverse imatinib-associated neutropenia, thereby allowing for more continuous imatinib administration. Thirteen patients with chronic-phase CML and Grade > or = 3, imatinib-induced neutropenia were treated with filgrastim. Treatment with filgrastim was initiated after a median of 22 months from the start of imatinib. Eleven patients received filgrastim 5 microg/kg 1-3 times weekly, and 2 patients received filgrastim 5 microg/kg daily; doses were titrated to maintain an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > or = 10(9)/L. Seven of 11 patients (64%) who began treatment with an ANC < 1.5 x 10(9)/L had responses (i.e., their ANC improved to > or = 2 x 10(9)/L within 21 days); the other 4 patients experienced slower recovery but were able to continue receiving imatinib uninterrupted. Before filgrastim administration was initiated, patients did not receive imatinib (due to neutropenia-related treatment interruptions) for an average of 21% of the total time since the start of imatinib. This figure decreased to 6% after the start of filgrastim treatment (P = 0.0008). Before filgrastim treatment was initiated, only one patient had achieved a major (partial) cytogenetic response. After the start of filgrastim treatment, five patients had major cytogenetic responses (including two complete responses). The authors concluded that filgrastim may overcome imatinib-associated neutropenia and allow improved delivery of imatinib. Some patients may experience improvements in their responses to therapy as a result.",Evaluation Study,5712.0,51.0,Imatinib mesylate administration has become standard treatment for patients with chronic myelogenous CML Although the safety profile of imatinib is favorable Grade or 3 neutropenia according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria occurs in 35-45 of patients with CML in chronic phase who receive standard-dose imatinib Myelosuppression results in treatment interruptions which may compromise responses to imatinib The authors investigated the ability of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor filgrastim to reverse imatinib-associated neutropenia thereby allowing for more continuous imatinib administration Thirteen patients with chronic-phase CML and Grade or 3 imatinib-induced neutropenia were treated with filgrastim Treatment with filgrastim was initiated after a median of 22 months from the start of imatinib Eleven patients received filgrastim 5 microg/kg 1-3 times weekly and 2 patients received filgrastim 5 microg/kg daily doses were titrated to maintain an absolute neutrophil count ANC or 10 9 /L Seven of 11 patients 64 who began treatment with an ANC 1.5 x 10 9 /L had responses i.e. their ANC improved to or 2 x 10 9 /L within 21 days the other 4 patients experienced slower recovery but were able to continue receiving imatinib uninterrupted Before filgrastim administration was initiated patients did not receive imatinib due to neutropenia-related treatment interruptions for an average of 21 of the total time since the start of imatinib This figure decreased to 6 after the start of filgrastim treatment P 0.0008 Before filgrastim treatment was initiated only one patient had achieved a major partial cytogenetic response After the start of filgrastim treatment five patients had major cytogenetic responses including two complete responses The authors concluded that filgrastim may overcome imatinib-associated neutropenia and allow improved delivery of imatinib Some patients may experience improvements in their responses to therapy as a result,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[577, 2347, 634, 71, 1417, 260, 24, 9, 7, 5, 442, 2194, 903, 242, 3, 367, 800, 1, 577, 16, 913, 88, 15, 27, 778, 768, 6, 3, 657, 12, 1377, 186, 155, 371, 1780, 4, 465, 512, 1, 7, 5, 903, 4, 442, 124, 54, 560, 260, 61, 577, 2858, 99, 4, 24, 7406, 92, 68, 4665, 253, 6, 577, 3, 738, 565, 3, 801, 1, 2764, 1975, 2122, 161, 5552, 6, 1772, 577, 41, 778, 2267, 2952, 9, 80, 1314, 577, 634, 3170, 7, 5, 442, 124, 903, 2, 88, 15, 27, 577, 277, 778, 11, 73, 5, 5552, 24, 5, 5552, 10, 1917, 50, 8, 52, 1, 350, 53, 29, 3, 2435, 1, 577, 2627, 7, 103, 5552, 33, 2440, 503, 14, 27, 1072, 709, 2, 18, 7, 103, 5552, 33, 2440, 503, 391, 415, 11, 15875, 6, 3040, 35, 1766, 2595, 1276, 6486, 15, 79, 83, 805, 648, 1, 175, 7, 660, 54, 4603, 24, 5, 35, 6486, 14, 33, 1006, 79, 83, 805, 42, 253, 70, 563, 136, 6486, 231, 6, 15, 18, 1006, 79, 83, 805, 262, 239, 162, 3, 127, 39, 7, 592, 6715, 1602, 84, 11, 1665, 6, 1906, 357, 577, 22029, 348, 5552, 634, 10, 1917, 7, 205, 44, 560, 577, 520, 6, 778, 139, 24, 7406, 9, 35, 1011, 1, 239, 1, 3, 181, 98, 1192, 3, 2435, 1, 577, 26, 15170, 340, 6, 49, 50, 3, 2435, 1, 5552, 24, 19, 13, 7044, 348, 5552, 24, 10, 1917, 158, 104, 69, 42, 513, 8, 458, 450, 1266, 51, 50, 3, 2435, 1, 5552, 24, 365, 7, 42, 458, 1266, 253, 141, 100, 236, 253, 3, 738, 4724, 17, 5552, 68, 1768, 577, 41, 778, 2, 1700, 231, 989, 1, 577, 476, 7, 68, 730, 1474, 4, 136, 253, 6, 36, 22, 8, 757]",1987.0,15197801,80
Long-term survival benefit and improved complete cytogenetic and molecular response rates with imatinib mesylate in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia after failure of interferon-alpha.,Blood,Blood,2004-06-15,"We reviewed 261 patients with chronicphase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) after interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) failure treated with imatinib mesylate 400 mg daily.

Prognostic significance of additional cytogenetic abnormalities in newly diagnosed patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with interferon-alpha: a Cancer and Leukemia Group B study.,International journal of oncology,Int. J. Oncol.,2004-07-01,"Secondary cytogenetic abnormalities at diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) have been associated with an inferior outcome in reported series of largely chemotherapy-treated patients. To date, no study has specifically focused on the prognostic significance of secondary karyotypic abnormalities, detected at the time of diagnosis, in interferon (IFN)-alpha treated patients. We compared the outcome of 29 newly diagnosed Ph+ CML patients with additional abnormalities to that of 234 sole Ph+ patients, treated on CALGB protocols with IFN-alpha alone or together with IFN-gamma or low-dose cytarabine. Complete and partial cytogenetic responses were achieved in 20 and 19% of sole Ph+ patients, compared to 23 and 18%, respectively, of patients with additional abnormalities (P=1.00). None of 4 patients with 'high-risk' secondary abnormalities [+8, +Ph and i(17)(q10)], for whom follow-up cytogenetic samples were available, achieved a cytogenetic response.

Extended follow-up of patients treated with imatinib mesylate (gleevec) for chronic myelogenous leukemia relapse after allogeneic transplantation: durable cytogenetic remission and conversion to complete donor chimerism without graft-versus-host disease.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2004-08-01,"Over the last several years, donor lymphocyte infusions have become the standard approach for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Recent reports indicate that imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) can induce remissions in these patients as well. Less is known about the extent and durability of these responses. We studied 15 patients treated with imatinib for recurrent CML after SCT, 10 patients with stable phase CML (SP-CML), 1 with accelerated phase (AP-CML), and 4 with blast phase (BP-CML). The dose of imatinib was 600 mg (n = 10) or 400 mg (n = 5) daily. Patients were followed for hematological, cytogenetic, and molecular response. A susbset of responders was followed for changes in donor-derived hematopoietic chimerism. Of the 10 patients with SP-CML, all achieved a hematological response. Within 3 months, five of these patients had achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCR). By six months, 9 of 10 patients had achieved CCR. The BCR-ABL transcript could not be detected by reverse transcription-PCR in 7 of these 9 patients. Patients who achieved CCR showed evidence of conversion to complete donor chimerism. No patient developed graft-versus-host disease. With a median follow up of 25 months, all patients are alive and 9 of 10 patients remain in CCR.

Granulocyte-macrophage progenitors as candidate leukemic stem cells in blast-crisis CML.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2004-08-01,"The progression of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) to blast crisis is supported by self-renewing leukemic stem cells. In normal mouse hematopoietic stem cells, the process of self-renewal involves the beta-catenin-signaling pathway. We investigated whether leukemic stem cells in CML also use the beta-catenin pathway for self-renewal. We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate hematopoietic stem cells, common myeloid progenitors, granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors from marrow during several phases of CML and from normal marrow. BCR-ABL, beta-catenin, and LEF-1 transcripts were compared by means of a quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay in normal and CML hematopoietic stem cells and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors. Confocal fluorescence microscopy and a lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell factor reporter assay were used to detect nuclear beta-catenin in these cells. In vitro replating assays were used to identify self-renewing cells as candidate leukemic stem cells, and the dependence of self-renewal on beta-catenin activation was tested by lentiviral transduction of hematopoietic progenitors with axin, an inhibitor of the beta-catenin pathway. The granulocyte-macrophage progenitor pool from patients with CML in blast crisis and imatinib-resistant CML was expanded, expressed BCR-ABL, and had elevated levels of nuclear beta-catenin as compared with the levels in progenitors from normal marrow. Unlike normal granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, CML granulocyte-macrophage progenitors formed self-renewing, replatable myeloid colonies, and in vitro self-renewal capacity was reduced by enforced expression of axin. Activation of beta-catenin in CML granulocyte-macrophage progenitors appears to enhance the self-renewal activity and leukemic potential of these cells.",Journal Article,5651.0,1180.0,The progression of chronic myelogenous CML to blast crisis is supported by self-renewing leukemic stem cells In normal mouse hematopoietic stem cells the process of self-renewal involves the beta-catenin-signaling pathway We investigated whether leukemic stem cells in CML also use the beta-catenin pathway for self-renewal We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate hematopoietic stem cells common myeloid progenitors granulocyte-macrophage progenitors and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors from marrow during several phases of CML and from normal marrow BCR-ABL beta-catenin and LEF-1 transcripts were compared by means of a quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay in normal and CML hematopoietic stem cells and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors Confocal fluorescence microscopy and a lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell factor reporter assay were used to detect nuclear beta-catenin in these cells In vitro replating assays were used to identify self-renewing cells as candidate leukemic stem cells and the dependence of self-renewal on beta-catenin activation was tested by lentiviral transduction of hematopoietic progenitors with axin an inhibitor of the beta-catenin pathway The granulocyte-macrophage progenitor pool from patients with CML in blast crisis and imatinib-resistant CML was expanded expressed BCR-ABL and had elevated levels of nuclear beta-catenin as compared with the levels in progenitors from normal marrow Unlike normal granulocyte-macrophage progenitors CML granulocyte-macrophage progenitors formed self-renewing replatable myeloid colonies and in vitro self-renewal capacity was reduced by enforced expression of axin Activation of beta-catenin in CML granulocyte-macrophage progenitors appears to enhance the self-renewal activity and leukemic potential of these cells,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 91, 1, 442, 2194, 903, 6, 3112, 6540, 16, 2708, 20, 1074, 13350, 2015, 452, 37, 4, 295, 830, 1007, 452, 37, 3, 1129, 1, 1074, 4495, 2921, 3, 1090, 1778, 314, 308, 21, 565, 317, 2015, 452, 37, 4, 903, 120, 119, 3, 1090, 1778, 308, 9, 1074, 4495, 21, 95, 1591, 735, 31, 6751, 6, 7910, 1007, 452, 37, 186, 533, 4321, 2764, 2674, 4321, 2, 21987, 7839, 4321, 29, 581, 190, 392, 3523, 1, 903, 2, 29, 295, 581, 1062, 1425, 1090, 1778, 2, 14136, 14, 2680, 11, 72, 20, 2263, 1, 8, 1156, 1772, 4456, 1451, 1260, 1329, 719, 4, 295, 2, 903, 1007, 452, 37, 2, 2764, 2674, 4321, 6541, 1591, 3804, 2, 8, 2303, 4239, 161, 102, 31, 161, 3674, 719, 11, 95, 6, 1426, 928, 1090, 1778, 4, 46, 37, 4, 439, 33251, 1013, 11, 95, 6, 255, 1074, 13350, 37, 22, 1609, 2015, 452, 37, 2, 3, 3721, 1, 1074, 4495, 23, 1090, 1778, 363, 10, 650, 20, 7823, 2761, 1, 1007, 4321, 5, 37746, 35, 230, 1, 3, 1090, 1778, 308, 3, 2764, 2674, 2520, 6545, 29, 7, 5, 903, 4, 3112, 6540, 2, 577, 436, 903, 10, 2064, 570, 1062, 1425, 2, 42, 804, 148, 1, 928, 1090, 1778, 22, 72, 5, 3, 148, 4, 4321, 29, 295, 581, 4246, 295, 2764, 2674, 4321, 903, 2764, 2674, 4321, 3516, 1074, 13350, 54311, 533, 8633, 2, 4, 439, 1074, 4495, 2162, 10, 405, 20, 7807, 55, 1, 37746, 363, 1, 1090, 1778, 4, 903, 2764, 2674, 4321, 1233, 6, 1304, 3, 1074, 4495, 128, 2, 2015, 174, 1, 46, 37]",1836.0,15306667,82
Detection of BCR-ABL kinase mutations in CD34+ cells from chronic myelogenous leukemia patients in complete cytogenetic remission on imatinib mesylate treatment.,Blood,Blood,2004-09-02,"The BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate induces complete cytogenetic response (CCR) in a high proportion of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients. However, patients in CCR usually demonstrate evidence of residual BCR-ABL-positive progenitors. The mechanisms underlying persistence of small numbers of malignant progenitors in imatinib-sensitive patients are unclear. BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations affecting drug binding can lead to secondary resistance to imatinib. We show here that kinase mutations could be detected in CD34+ cells isolated from CML patients in CCR on imatinib. Most mutations seen have not been reported in previous clinical studies. Interestingly, several of the involved amino acid positions have been implicated in an in vitro mutagenesis screen. These BCR-ABL mutations were associated with varying levels of imatinib resistance. Two of 5 patients in whom mutations were detected on initial evaluation have relapsed. In addition, 4 patients in whom mutations were not initially detected, but with rising BCR-ABL mRNA levels on quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) analysis, had mutations detected on follow-up evaluation. We conclude that BCR-ABL kinase mutations can be detected in CD34+ cells from CML patients in CCR on imatinib, may contribute to persistence of small populations of malignant progenitors, and could be a potential source of relapse.",Journal Article,5619.0,172.0,The BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate induces complete cytogenetic response CCR in a high proportion of chronic myelogenous CML patients However patients in CCR usually demonstrate evidence of residual BCR-ABL-positive progenitors The mechanisms underlying persistence of small numbers of malignant progenitors in imatinib-sensitive patients are unclear BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations affecting drug binding can lead to secondary resistance to imatinib We show here that kinase mutations could be detected in CD34+ cells isolated from CML patients in CCR on imatinib Most mutations seen have not been reported in previous clinical studies Interestingly several of the involved amino acid positions have been implicated in an in vitro mutagenesis screen These BCR-ABL mutations were associated with varying levels of imatinib resistance Two of 5 patients in whom mutations were detected on initial evaluation have relapsed In addition 4 patients in whom mutations were not initially detected but with rising BCR-ABL mRNA levels on quantitative polymerase chain reaction Q-PCR analysis had mutations detected on follow-up evaluation We conclude that BCR-ABL kinase mutations can be detected in CD34+ cells from CML patients in CCR on imatinib may contribute to persistence of small populations of malignant progenitors and could be a potential source of relapse,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1062, 1425, 216, 230, 577, 2347, 1516, 236, 1266, 51, 4992, 4, 8, 64, 920, 1, 442, 2194, 903, 7, 137, 7, 4, 4992, 2082, 608, 241, 1, 753, 1062, 1425, 109, 4321, 3, 483, 1181, 4108, 1, 302, 1870, 1, 393, 4321, 4, 577, 745, 7, 32, 1200, 1062, 1425, 216, 1398, 138, 2319, 234, 791, 122, 1122, 6, 568, 251, 6, 577, 21, 514, 467, 17, 216, 138, 359, 40, 530, 4, 2215, 37, 1355, 29, 903, 7, 4, 4992, 23, 577, 96, 138, 527, 47, 44, 85, 210, 4, 698, 38, 94, 2873, 392, 1, 3, 646, 3078, 971, 7134, 47, 85, 1771, 4, 35, 4, 439, 8595, 2413, 46, 1062, 1425, 138, 11, 41, 5, 2990, 148, 1, 577, 251, 100, 1, 33, 7, 4, 953, 138, 11, 530, 23, 388, 451, 47, 591, 4, 352, 39, 7, 4, 953, 138, 11, 44, 1625, 530, 84, 5, 3699, 1062, 1425, 956, 148, 23, 1156, 1451, 1260, 1329, 4170, 604, 65, 42, 138, 530, 23, 166, 126, 451, 21, 2060, 17, 1062, 1425, 216, 138, 122, 40, 530, 4, 2215, 37, 29, 903, 7, 4, 4992, 23, 577, 68, 1248, 6, 4108, 1, 302, 1184, 1, 393, 4321, 2, 359, 40, 8, 174, 2353, 1, 429]",1369.0,15345592,198

Expression of imatinib mesylate-targeted kinases in endometrial carcinoma.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2004-10-01,"Imatinib mesylate is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that specifically targets c-Kit, Abl, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). It has been shown to be an effective treatment for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). These cancers are characterized by activating mutations of the Abl and c-Kit tyrosine kinases, respectively. To determine whether imatinib mesylate could be a potentially useful agent in the treatment of endometrial cancer, we assessed the expressions of Abl, c-Kit, and PDGFR in both primary and recurrent endometrial carcinoma. We performed immunohistochemical analysis on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections from 63 patients: 33 with endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (EEC), 11 with uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC), 12 with recurrent EEC, and seven with recurrent UPSC. The sections were stained with commercially available antibodies for Abl, PDGFR, and c-Kit. The sections were also stained for phosphorylated Abl and phosphorylated PDGFR. Among the primary EEC, 28/33 (85%) stained positively for Abl and 30/33 (91%) were positive for PDGFR. Of the primary UPSC, 8/11 (73%) were positive for Abl. In addition, 8/11 (73%) of the primary UPSC tumors were positive for PDGFR. Neither the primary EEC (0/33) nor the primary UPSC (0/11) expressed c-Kit. Of the recurrent EEC tumors, 11/12 (92%) were positive for Abl expression, 12/12 (100%) were positive for PDGFR, and 2/8 (25%) were positive for c-Kit. Of the recurrent UPSC, 6/7 (86%) were positive for Abl, 7/7 (100%) were positive for PDGFR, and 2/4 (50%) for c-Kit. In addition, the majority of primary and recurrent tumors were positive for phosphorylated Abl (primary EEC, 91%; primary UPSC, 64%; recurrent EEC, 83%; recurrent UPSC, 86%), and phosphorylated PDGFR (primary EEC, 46%; primary UPSC, 40%; recurrent EEC, 58%; recurrent UPSC, 100%). Within the EEC primary tumors, the differences in kinase expression by grade of tumor were not significant except for PDGFR kinase; the lower grade tumors (1 and 2) had more PDGFR expression than the grade 3 tumors (P < 0.05). The majority of primary and recurrent EEC, as well as primary and recurrent UPSC express Abl and PDGFR.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation among patients with leukemia of all ages in Texas.,Cancer,Cancer,2004-11-01,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an effective but expensive medical procedure to which some ethnic minorities, the elderly, and those without insurance have been shown to have limited access. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether socioeconomic factors were associated with HSCT usage rates in patients with leukemia. The authors identified 6574 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or other leukemias from the 1999 Texas Hospital Inpatient Discharge Public Use Data File. Of these patients, 1604 received an autologous or allogeneic HSCT. The authors assessed patients' ethnicity, payer status, age, gender, and comorbid medical conditions. Logistic regression was used to control for patient characteristics and to evaluate associations among payer status, ethnicity, and HSCT use. P < or = 0.05 indicated statistical significance. Patients who self-paid had the highest rate of HSCT use in all age groups (32%; P < or = 0.01) and in the adult group (36%; P = 0.11). Elderly patients with Medicare had a low rate of HSCT use (17%; P = 0.13). Logistic regression showed no statistically significant associations between payer status or ethnicity and HSCT use. However, elderly women were significantly less likely to undergo HSCT than elderly men (odds ratio, 0.34; P < or = 0.01).

Tipifarnib was taken orally for 21 days of a 28-day cycle. For cycle 1, patients were randomly assigned to one of four dose levels: 100 mg bid, 200 mg bid, 300 mg bid, and 600 mg bid. In cycle 1, peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells were analyzed for inhibition of HDJ2 prenylation by Western blot analysis at baseline and on day 21. Twenty-three patients were assessable for analysis of HDJ2 prenylation before and after therapy. Inhibition of farnesylation was noted at all dose levels, although the highest level of inhibition was noted at the 300-mg-bid dose. The inhibition of farnesylation in the peripheral blood correlated with the inhibition in the bone marrow (r = 0.62).

Differential regulation of the p70 S6 kinase pathway by interferon alpha (IFNalpha) and imatinib mesylate (STI571) in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells.,Blood,Blood,2005-03-24,"The precise mechanisms by which imatinib mesylate (STI571) and interferon alpha (IFNalpha) exhibit antileukemic effects are not known. We examined the effects of IFNs or imatinib mesylate on signaling pathways regulating initiation of mRNA translation in BCR-ABL-expressing cells. Treatment of IFN-sensitive KT-1 cells with IFNalpha resulted in phosphorylation/activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and downstream activation of p70 S6 kinase. The IFN-activated p70 S6 kinase was found to regulate phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein, which regulates translation of mRNAs with oligopyrimidine tracts in the 5'-untranslated region. In addition, IFNalpha treatment resulted in an mTOR- and/or phosphatidyl-inositol 3'(PI 3') kinase-dependent phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 repressor of mRNA translation on sites that are required for its deactivation and dissociation from the eukaryotic initiation factor-4E (eIF4E) complex. In contrast to the effects of IFNs, imatinib mesylate suppressed p70 S6 kinase activity, consistent with inhibition of BCR-ABL-mediated activation of the mTOR/p70 S6 kinase pathway. Moreover, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin enhanced the suppressive effects of imatinib mesylate on primary leukemic granulocyte macrophage-colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) progenitors from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Taken altogether, our data demonstrate that IFNs and imatinib mesylate differentially regulate PI 3' kinase/mTOR-dependent signaling cascades in BCR-ABL-transformed cells, consistent with distinct effects of these agents on pathways regulating mRNA translation. They also support the concept that combined use of imatinib mesylate with mTOR inhibitors may be an appropriate future therapeutic strategy for the treatment of CML.",Journal Article,5416.0,55.0,The precise mechanisms by which imatinib mesylate STI571 and interferon alpha IFNalpha exhibit antileukemic effects are not known We examined the effects of IFNs or imatinib mesylate on signaling pathways regulating initiation of mRNA translation in BCR-ABL-expressing cells Treatment of IFN-sensitive KT-1 cells with IFNalpha resulted in phosphorylation/activation of mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR and downstream activation of p70 S6 kinase The IFN-activated p70 S6 kinase was found to regulate phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein which regulates translation of mRNAs with oligopyrimidine tracts in the 5'-untranslated region In addition IFNalpha treatment resulted in an mTOR- and/or phosphatidyl-inositol 3 PI 3 kinase-dependent phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 repressor of mRNA translation on sites that are required for its deactivation and dissociation from the eukaryotic initiation factor-4E eIF4E complex In contrast to the effects of IFNs imatinib mesylate suppressed p70 S6 kinase activity consistent with inhibition of BCR-ABL-mediated activation of the mTOR/p70 S6 kinase pathway Moreover the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin enhanced the suppressive effects of imatinib mesylate on primary leukemic granulocyte macrophage-colony-forming unit CFU-GM progenitors from patients with chronic myelogenous CML Taken altogether our data demonstrate that IFNs and imatinib mesylate differentially regulate PI 3 kinase/mTOR-dependent signaling cascades in BCR-ABL-transformed cells consistent with distinct effects of these agents on pathways regulating mRNA translation They also support the concept that combined use of imatinib mesylate with mTOR inhibitors may be an appropriate future therapeutic strategy for the treatment of CML,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 3260, 483, 20, 92, 577, 2347, 5735, 2, 1688, 950, 10947, 2239, 4512, 176, 32, 44, 440, 21, 409, 3, 176, 1, 11808, 15, 577, 2347, 23, 314, 460, 2681, 1118, 1, 956, 2691, 4, 1062, 1425, 1046, 37, 24, 1, 1256, 745, 24697, 14, 37, 5, 10947, 627, 4, 982, 363, 1, 2359, 283, 1, 1620, 873, 2, 1489, 363, 1, 9036, 4977, 216, 3, 1256, 735, 9036, 4977, 216, 10, 204, 6, 2288, 982, 1, 4977, 8194, 178, 92, 2468, 2691, 1, 7503, 5, 43735, 10950, 4, 3, 7344, 7379, 1053, 4, 352, 10947, 24, 627, 4, 35, 873, 2, 15, 15628, 13816, 27, 2928, 27, 216, 470, 982, 1, 6726, 7949, 7434, 1, 956, 2691, 23, 633, 17, 32, 616, 9, 211, 30663, 2, 10443, 29, 3, 8374, 1118, 161, 6726, 6916, 840, 4, 748, 6, 3, 176, 1, 11808, 577, 2347, 1908, 9036, 4977, 216, 128, 925, 5, 297, 1, 1062, 1425, 517, 363, 1, 3, 873, 9036, 4977, 216, 308, 1393, 3, 873, 230, 1620, 651, 3, 3707, 176, 1, 577, 2347, 23, 86, 2015, 2764, 2674, 1975, 4525, 2712, 10388, 2147, 4321, 29, 7, 5, 442, 2194, 903, 1633, 6767, 114, 74, 608, 17, 11808, 2, 577, 2347, 2478, 2288, 2928, 27, 216, 873, 470, 314, 8036, 4, 1062, 1425, 2423, 37, 925, 5, 834, 176, 1, 46, 183, 23, 460, 2681, 956, 2691, 491, 120, 538, 3, 2545, 17, 397, 119, 1, 577, 2347, 5, 873, 222, 68, 40, 35, 870, 508, 189, 692, 9, 3, 24, 1, 903]",1735.0,15790787,18
Survival benefit with imatinib mesylate therapy in patients with accelerated-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia--comparison with historic experience.,Cancer,Cancer,2005-05-01,"The effect of imatinib mesylate on survival in the accelerated phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is unknown. The objectives of this study were to update the long-term experience with imatinib in patients who had accelerated-phase CML and to compare outcomes with historic experience. The outcomes of 176 patients who received treatment with imatinib were reviewed and compared with the outcomes of 213 historic control patients with accelerated-phase CML who received treatment with interferon-alpha or with other modalities. With imatinib, the complete hematologic response rate was 82% versus a rate < or = 50% for others, and the complete cytogenetic response rate was 43% versus rates of 0-6% for others. The estimated 4-year survival rates were 53% with imatinib, 42% with interferon-alpha, and 0-21% for others. A multivariate analysis of the total population of 389 patients indicated that imatinib therapy (vs. other therapies) was an independent, favorable prognostic factor for survival (P < 0.0001; hazard rate, 0.62). A subset analysis that included only patients who were treated with imatinib and interferon-alpha (276 patients) also identified imatinib as an independent favorable prognostic factor (P < 0.0001; hazard rate, 0.65). The 3-month cytogenetic response to imatinib was associated with significantly different survival outcomes (P < 0.0001). A multivariate analysis that included pretreatment characteristics and 3-month cytogenetic response among 150 patients who received imatinib and were alive at 3 months identified only 2 adverse independent prognostic factors: lack of a cytogenetic response at 3 months (P < 0.001) and anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dL; P = 0.003).

Role of protein kinase C-delta (PKC-delta) in the generation of the effects of IFN-alpha in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells.,Experimental hematology,Exp. Hematol.,2005-05-01,"The mechanisms by which interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) induces antileukemic responses in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells are not known. We examined whether a member of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of proteins, PKC-delta, is activated during treatment of BCR-ABL cells with IFN-alpha and participates in the induction of interferon responses. Immunoblots and immune complex kinase assays were performed to study the phosphorylation and activation of PKC-delta in response to IFN-alpha in CML-derived cell lines. The effects of pharmacological inhibition of PKC-delta on the suppressive effects of IFN-alpha on leukemic CFU-GM progenitors from CML patients were assessed by clonogenic assays in methylcellulose. IFN-alpha treatment of the sensitive CML-derived KT-1 cell line resulted in phosphorylation of PKC-delta and activation of its kinase domain. Such phosphorylation/activation of PKC-delta was required for phosphorylation of Stat1 on serine 727, as inhibition of PKC-delta activity blocked the IFN-alpha-dependent serine phosphorylation of Stat1 and IFN-alpha-inducible gene transcription. IFN-alpha treatment strongly inhibited leukemic CFU-GM progenitor colony formation from bone marrow or peripheral blood of patients with CML, and such inhibition was reversed by concomitant treatment of the cells with the PKC-delta pharmacologic inhibitor rottlerin. Taken altogether, our data demonstrate that PKC-delta plays a critical role in Type I IFN signaling in BCR-ABL expressing cells, acting as a serine kinase for Stat1, to regulate transcriptional activation of interferon-regulated genes and induction of antileukemic responses.",Journal Article,5378.0,30.0,The mechanisms by which interferon alpha IFN-alpha induces antileukemic responses in chronic myelogenous CML cells are not known We examined whether a member of the protein kinase C PKC family of proteins PKC-delta is activated during treatment of BCR-ABL cells with IFN-alpha and participates in the induction of interferon responses Immunoblots and immune complex kinase assays were performed to study the phosphorylation and activation of PKC-delta in response to IFN-alpha in CML-derived cell lines The effects of pharmacological inhibition of PKC-delta on the suppressive effects of IFN-alpha on leukemic CFU-GM progenitors from CML patients were assessed by clonogenic assays in methylcellulose IFN-alpha treatment of the sensitive CML-derived KT-1 cell line resulted in phosphorylation of PKC-delta and activation of its kinase domain Such phosphorylation/activation of PKC-delta was required for phosphorylation of Stat1 on serine 727 as inhibition of PKC-delta activity blocked the IFN-alpha-dependent serine phosphorylation of Stat1 and IFN-alpha-inducible gene transcription IFN-alpha treatment strongly inhibited leukemic CFU-GM progenitor colony formation from marrow or peripheral blood of patients with CML and such inhibition was reversed by concomitant treatment of the cells with the PKC-delta pharmacologic inhibitor rottlerin Taken altogether our data demonstrate that PKC-delta plays a critical role in Type I IFN signaling in BCR-ABL expressing cells acting as a serine kinase for Stat1 to regulate transcriptional activation of interferon-regulated genes and induction of antileukemic responses,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 483, 20, 92, 1688, 950, 1256, 950, 1516, 4512, 253, 4, 442, 2194, 903, 37, 32, 44, 440, 21, 409, 317, 8, 2693, 1, 3, 178, 216, 256, 4644, 607, 1, 652, 4644, 4305, 16, 735, 190, 24, 1, 1062, 1425, 37, 5, 1256, 950, 2, 11931, 4, 3, 504, 1, 1688, 253, 13867, 2, 250, 840, 216, 1013, 11, 173, 6, 45, 3, 982, 2, 363, 1, 4644, 4305, 4, 51, 6, 1256, 950, 4, 903, 526, 31, 285, 3, 176, 1, 3419, 297, 1, 4644, 4305, 23, 3, 3707, 176, 1, 1256, 950, 23, 2015, 10388, 2147, 4321, 29, 903, 7, 11, 275, 20, 3798, 1013, 4, 24816, 1256, 950, 24, 1, 3, 745, 903, 526, 24697, 14, 31, 328, 627, 4, 982, 1, 4644, 4305, 2, 363, 1, 211, 216, 1398, 225, 982, 363, 1, 4644, 4305, 10, 616, 9, 982, 1, 5793, 23, 3734, 14093, 22, 297, 1, 4644, 4305, 128, 2582, 3, 1256, 950, 470, 3734, 982, 1, 5793, 2, 1256, 950, 2877, 145, 866, 1256, 950, 24, 1327, 879, 2015, 10388, 2147, 2520, 1975, 1264, 29, 581, 15, 672, 315, 1, 7, 5, 903, 2, 225, 297, 10, 3682, 20, 1781, 24, 1, 3, 37, 5, 3, 4644, 4305, 2788, 230, 30761, 1633, 6767, 114, 74, 608, 17, 4644, 4305, 1698, 8, 740, 200, 4, 267, 70, 1256, 314, 4, 1062, 1425, 1046, 37, 5375, 22, 8, 3734, 216, 9, 5793, 6, 2288, 1431, 363, 1, 1688, 1065, 214, 2, 504, 1, 4512, 253]",1617.0,15850832,37
Molecular responses in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase treated with imatinib mesylate.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin.

We analyzed the results of quantitative PCR in 280 patients with CML in chronic phase who achieved complete cytogenetic remission with imatinib (117 after IFN-alpha failure and 163 previously untreated). Median follow-up was 31 months (range, 3-52 months). Median BCR-ABL/ABL ratio before the start of therapy was 39.44 (range, 0.252-170.53). A major molecular response (BCR-ABL/ABL ratio <0.05%) was achieved in 174 (62%), and transcripts became undetectable (complete molecular response) in 95 (34%). By multivariate analysis, only treatment with high-dose imatinib (P = 0.02) was associated with achievement of a major molecular response. Nine of 166 (5%) patients who achieved a major molecular response lost their cytogenetic remission, compared with 25 of 68 (37%) among those who did not achieve this response (P < 0.0001). Patients achieving a major molecular response 12 months after the start of therapy had significantly better complete cytogenetic remission duration than others. A >1-log reduction in transcript levels after 3 months of therapy predicted for an improved probability of achieving a major molecular response at 24 months. Increasing levels of BCR-ABL transcripts predicted for a loss of cytogenetic remission only among patients who did not achieve a major molecular response.

A novel method for routine, high-yield no-carrier-added synthesis of [(124)I]-, [(125)I]- and [(131)I]-6-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-2-(4-iodophenylamino)-8-methyl-8H-pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-one has been developed. The 4'-trimethylstannyl- or 4'-tri-n-butylstannyl-pyridopyrimidinone precursors were prepared from the aryl bromide via a palladium-mediated coupling with hexaalkylditin (dioxane/microwave irradiation/10 min at 160 degrees C). The radioiodination of 4'-stannylpyridopyrimidinones was found to optimally occur via an iododestannylation with Na(124)I, Na(125)I or Na(131)I in the presence of an oxidant [30% H(2)O(2)/HOAc (1:3)/10 min] in 79-87% radiochemical yield with >99% radiochemical purity.

Clin. Oncol.,2005-05-09,"To determine the activity of decitabine, a DNA methylation inhibitor, in imatinib-refractory or intolerant chronic myelogenous leukemia. Thirty-five patients were enrolled in this phase II study (12 in chronic phase, 17 in accelerated phase, and six in blastic phase). Decitabine was administered at 15 mg/m2 intravenously over 1 hour daily, 5 days a week for 2 weeks. DNA methylation was measured using a LINE1 bisulfite/pyrosequencing assay. Complete hematologic responses were seen in 12 patients (34%) and partial hematologic responses in seven patients (20%), for an overall hematologic response rate of 54% (83% in chronic phase, 41% in accelerated phase, and 34% in blastic phase). Major cytogenetic responses were observed in six patients (17%), and minor cytogenetic responses were seen in 10 patients (29%) for an overall cytogenetic response rate of 46%. Median response duration was 3.5 months (range, 2 to 13+ months). Myelosuppression was the major adverse effect, with neutropenic fever in 28 (23%) of 124 courses of therapy. LINE1 methylation decreased from 71.3% +/- 1.4% (mean +/- standard error of the mean) to 60.7% +/- 1.4% after 1 week, 50.9% +/- 2.4% after 2 weeks, and returned to 66.5% +/- 2.7% at recovery of counts (median, 46 days). LINE1 methylation at the end of week 1 did not correlate with subsequent responses. However, at day 12, the absolute decrease in methylation was 14.5% +/- 3.0% versus 26.8% +/- 2.7% in responders versus nonresponders (P = .007).

Graft-versus-leukemia target antigens in chronic myelogenous leukemia are expressed on myeloid progenitor cells.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2005-06-01,"Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) reliably induces durable remission in 75% to 80% of patients with relapsed chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. We previously reported the identification of a high titer-specific immunoglobulin G response against two novel leukemia-associated antigens, CML28 and CML66, which correlated with immune-induced remission. The present studies characterize expression of CML28 and CML66 in primary hematopoietic tissues. Specific monoclonal antibodies to CML28 and CML66 were developed and used to detect antigen expression in leukemia cell lines and primary leukemia tissue on Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Expression patterns were confirmed by antigen-specific real-time PCR. Both CML28 and CML66 were highly expressed in leukemic blasts from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and CML blast crisis but barely detectable in normal bone marrow, normal peripheral blood, or leukemic cells from patients with stable-phase CML. In contrast, purified CD34+ progenitors from normal individuals and patients with stable-phase CML expressed high levels of CML28 and CML66 transcript and protein. Immunohistochemical staining for CML66 confirmed rare staining of myeloid precursors in normal marrow and diffuse staining of myeloblastic cells in acute myelogenous leukemia and blast crisis CML marrows. The expression patterns of CML28 and CML66 are strikingly similar and suggest that antigen expression may play a role in shaping the post-DLI antibody repertoire.

"Significance of myelofibrosis in early chronic-phase, chronic myelogenous leukemia on imatinib mesylate therapy.",Cancer,Cancer,2005-08-01,"Myelofibrosis is associated historically with a poor prognosis in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Its significance in the recent era of effective therapy with imatinib mesylate is unknown. The current study evaluated the significance of the degree of pretreatment myelofibrosis on response and survival with imatinib therapy in patients with newly diagnosed CML. The study group comprised 198 patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive, chronic-phase CML treated with imatinib mesylate therapy. They were analyzed for the prognostic significance of bone marrow reticulin fibrosis.

MYC encodes an oncogenic transcription factor, of which target genes presumably contribute to cellular transformation. Although Myc regulates about 15% of genes and combinations of target genes are likely required for tumorigenesis, we studied in depth the expression of the Myc target gene, JPO1/CDCA7, in human cancers and its ability to provoke tumorigenesis in transgenic mice. JPO1/CDCA7 is frequently overexpressed in human cancers, and in particular, its expression is highly elevated in chronic myelogenous leukemia blast crisis as compared with the chronic phase. In murine lymphoid tissues, ectopic human JPO1/CDCA7 expression resulted in a 2-fold increased risk of lymphoid malignancies at 1 year. The transgene, which was driven by the H2-K promoter, exhibited leaky expression in nonlymphoid tissues such as kidney.

Impact of posttransplantation G-CSF on outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,Blood,Blood,2005-10-20,"Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is often administered after hematopoietic-cell transplantation (HCT) to accelerate neutrophil recovery, but it is unclear what impact G-CSF has on long-term transplantation outcomes. We analyzed within the database of the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research the impact of giving posttransplantation G-CSF on the outcomes of allogeneic HCT for acute myelogenous leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia in 2719 patients who underwent transplantation between 1995 and 2000. These included 1435 recipients of HLA-identical sibling bone marrow (BM), 609 recipients of HLA-identical peripheral-blood stem cells (PBSCs), and 675 recipients of unrelated donor BM transplants. Outcomes were compared between patients receiving or not receiving G-CSF within 7 days of HCT according to graft type. Median follow-up was more than 30 months (range, 2-87 months). G-CSF shortened the posttransplantation neutropenic period, but did not affect days +30 and +100 treatment-related mortality (TRM). Probabilities of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), leukemia-free survival (LFS), and overall survival were similar whether or not G-CSF was given.

Adaphostin-induced oxidative stress overcomes BCR/ABL mutation-dependent and -independent imatinib resistance.,Blood,Blood,2005-11-15,"The BCR/ABL kinase has been targeted for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) by imatinib mesylate. While imatinib has been extremely effective for chronic phase CML, blast crisis CML and Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are often resistant. In particular, mutation of the T315 residue in the bcr/abl activation loop renders cells highly resistant to imatinib and to second-generation kinase inhibitors such as BMS-354825 or AMN107. Adaphostin is a tyrphostin that was originally intended to inhibit the BCR/ABL kinase by competing with its peptide substrates. Recent findings have in addition implicated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cytotoxic mechanism of adaphostin. In view of this unique mode of action, we examined the effects of adaphostin on numerous imatinib-resistant leukemia models, including imatinib-resistant CML and Ph+ ALL cell lines, cells harboring point mutations in BCR/ABL, and specimens from imatinib-resistant CML patients, using assays for intracellular ROS, apoptosis, and clonogenicity.

In addition to imatinib mesylate, all patients had received prior therapy with interferon-alpha and seven patients had received other treatments. The median duration of therapy with lonafarnib was 8 weeks (range, 2-41 wks). Two patients responded. One patient in the accelerated phase of CML returned to the chronic phase, a response that lasted for 3 months. Another patient with chronic phase disease had lowering of the leukocyte count without the need for hydroxyurea and normalization of the differential count that lasted for 5 months.

Validation of the 2-DeltaDeltaCt calculation as an alternate method of data analysis for quantitative PCR of BCR-ABL P210 transcripts.,"Diagnostic molecular pathology : the American journal of surgical pathology, part B",Diagn. Mol. Pathol.,2006-03-01,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder that is characterized by the presence of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 and results in the formation of the Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome and is present in most of CML patients. The Ph1 chromosome forms a chimeric gene that encodes an abnormal P210 mRNA transcript in most CML patients. Surveillance for minimal residual disease by detection of BCR/ABL transcripts is currently done mostly by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Quantitation of BCR/ABL transcripts can monitor tumor load and the outcome of therapy. Absolute quantification determines the input copy number of the transcript of interest, usually by plotting the amount of PCR product onto a standard curve based on serial dilutions of the same product cloned in plasmids. Relative quantification describes the change in expression of the target gene in the patient sample relative to that of a control transcript by using the 2-DeltaDeltaCt calculation. The results of real-time RT-PCR for BCR/ABL transcripts are often analyzed by using plasmid DNA standard curves. In the present study, 79 BCR/ABL transcript-positive samples from CML patients who were being monitored for minimal residual disease by real-time quantitative RT-PCR were studied to determine whether the 2-DeltaDeltaCt approach was equivalent to the plasmid standard curve method. BCR/ABL P210 transcripts were quantitated using both the plasmid standard curve method and the 2-DeltaDeltaCt calculation. The comparison of both methods revealed a highly significant and linear correlation between the plasmid standard curve method and the 2-DeltaDeltaCt calculation (R2=0.98, P<0.0001). Furthermore, there was a reduction of preparation time, contamination risk, and reagent usage.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR monitoring of BCR-ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia shows lack of agreement in blood and bone marrow samples.,International journal of oncology,Int. J. Oncol.,2006-05-01,"Molecular monitoring of the BCR-ABL transcript in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) using quantitative RT-PCR provides clinicians with important diagnostic and prognostic information. To determine whether molecular detection and monitoring of CML is comparable using peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) aspirate samples, we performed a prospective study using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) of paired PB and BM samples from 41 patients with CML entered onto a single Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) treatment study. QRT-PCR analysis of PB and BM samples was performed prior to initiation of, and during, treatment with homoharringtonine and cytarabine on a CALGB study for previously untreated CML. Statistical analyses demonstrated good agreement of PB and BM pre-treatment samples. However, using the Bland-Altman statistical method that measures true agreement between PB and BM values, we found that there was only modest agreement of BCR-ABL measurements in PB and BM for samples obtained during treatment. PB values obtained during treatment tended to be lower than the corresponding BM values [average difference = -0.37 (p<0.001) in 36 paired samples] and the 95% limits of agreement ranged from -1.23 to 0.48. Nevertheless, our study demonstrates that BM and PB QRT-PCR values followed a similar trend during treatment (Spearman correlation coefficient, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70, 0.96). Our data suggest that, quantitatively, PB and BM measurements of BCR-ABL are frequently disparate. Since BM values tended to be higher than PB values, BM sampling provides the most accurate assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD). Based on these results, we caution against interchanging BM with PB sampling for MRD monitoring during treatment of CML since this may lead to misinterpretation of treatment results.",Journal Article,5013.0,23.0,Molecular monitoring of the BCR-ABL transcript in chronic myelogenous CML using quantitative RT-PCR provides clinicians with important diagnostic and prognostic information To determine whether molecular detection and monitoring of CML is comparable using peripheral blood PB and marrow BM aspirate samples we performed a prospective study using quantitative real-time RT-PCR QRT-PCR of paired PB and BM samples from 41 patients with CML entered onto a single Cancer and Group B CALGB treatment study QRT-PCR analysis of PB and BM samples was performed prior to initiation of and during treatment with homoharringtonine and cytarabine on a CALGB study for previously untreated CML Statistical analyses demonstrated good agreement of PB and BM pre-treatment samples However using the Bland-Altman statistical method that measures true agreement between PB and BM values we found that there was only modest agreement of BCR-ABL measurements in PB and BM for samples obtained during treatment PB values obtained during treatment tended to be lower than the corresponding BM values average difference -0.37 p 0.001 in 36 paired samples and the 95 limits of agreement ranged from -1.23 to 0.48 Nevertheless our study demonstrates that BM and PB QRT-PCR values followed a similar trend during treatment Spearman correlation coefficient 0.83 95 CI 0.70 0.96 Our data suggest that quantitatively PB and BM measurements of BCR-ABL are frequently disparate Since BM values tended to be higher than PB values BM sampling provides the most accurate assessment of minimal residual disease MRD Based on these results we caution against interchanging BM with PB sampling for MRD monitoring during treatment of CML since this may lead to misinterpretation of treatment results,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[219, 1315, 1, 3, 1062, 1425, 3268, 4, 442, 2194, 903, 75, 1156, 240, 604, 777, 1490, 5, 305, 752, 2, 177, 487, 6, 223, 317, 219, 638, 2, 1315, 1, 903, 16, 1279, 75, 672, 315, 3767, 2, 581, 1246, 8022, 347, 21, 173, 8, 482, 45, 75, 1156, 1589, 98, 240, 604, 5822, 604, 1, 2355, 3767, 2, 1246, 347, 29, 605, 7, 5, 903, 2836, 3301, 8, 226, 12, 2, 87, 132, 4077, 24, 45, 5822, 604, 65, 1, 3767, 2, 1246, 347, 10, 173, 324, 6, 1118, 1, 2, 190, 24, 5, 18768, 2, 1855, 23, 8, 4077, 45, 9, 373, 1278, 903, 1050, 318, 264, 1178, 2024, 1, 3767, 2, 1246, 671, 24, 347, 137, 75, 3, 11150, 15322, 1050, 596, 17, 1018, 2501, 2024, 59, 3767, 2, 1246, 1030, 21, 204, 17, 125, 10, 158, 1721, 2024, 1, 1062, 1425, 1685, 4, 3767, 2, 1246, 9, 347, 683, 190, 24, 3767, 1030, 683, 190, 24, 3886, 6, 40, 280, 76, 3, 1734, 1246, 1030, 1011, 523, 13, 567, 19, 13, 144, 4, 511, 2355, 347, 2, 3, 48, 3526, 1, 2024, 1869, 29, 14, 382, 6, 13, 576, 3873, 114, 45, 1902, 17, 1246, 2, 3767, 5822, 604, 1030, 370, 8, 288, 853, 190, 24, 5061, 816, 3200, 13, 852, 48, 58, 13, 431, 13, 921, 114, 74, 309, 17, 5889, 3767, 2, 1246, 1685, 1, 1062, 1425, 32, 746, 7985, 1192, 1246, 1030, 3886, 6, 40, 142, 76, 3767, 1030, 1246, 2874, 777, 3, 96, 1481, 455, 1, 1048, 753, 34, 2029, 90, 23, 46, 99, 21, 5526, 480, 55397, 1246, 5, 3767, 2874, 9, 2029, 1315, 190, 24, 1, 903, 1192, 26, 68, 1122, 6, 22357, 1, 24, 99]",1760.0,16596225,2
Survival advantage from imatinib compared with the combination interferon-alpha plus cytarabine in chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia: historical comparison between two phase 3 trials.,Blood,Blood,2006-04-20,"In the multinational IRIS study comparing imatinib with interferon plus cytarabine (IFN/Ara-C) in patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CP CML), imatinib demonstrated significantly higher rates of complete cytogenetic responses (CCyRs) and improved progression-free survival (PFS). However, because of a high early crossover rate to imatinib, survival benefit was not assessable. Here, we report the result of a study comparing long-term outcome of patients included in 2 prospective randomized trials: 551 patients assigned to imatinib in the IRIS trial from 2000 to 2001 and 325 patients who received the combination IFN/Ara-C in the CML91 trial between 1991 and 1996 before imatinib was available. With a follow-up of 42 months for both groups of patients, estimated CCyR, survival free of transformation, and overall survival were significantly higher with imatinib compared with IFN/Ara-C (P < .001, P = .004, and P < .001, respectively).

IL-2 regulates FOXP3 expression in human CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells through a STAT-dependent mechanism and induces the expansion of these cells in vivo.,Blood,Blood,2006-04-27,"IL-2 plays a critical role in the maintenance of CD4+CD25+ FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) in vivo. We examined the effects of IL-2 signaling in human Tregs. In vitro, IL-2 selectively up-regulated the expression of FOXP3 in purified CD4+CD25+ T cells but not in CD4+CD25- cells. This regulation involved the binding of STAT3 and STAT5 proteins to a highly conserved STAT-binding site located in the first intron of the FOXP3 gene. We also examined the effects of low-dose IL-2 treatment in 12 patients with metastatic cancer and 9 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Overall, IL-2 treatment resulted in a 1.9 median fold increase in the frequency of CD4+CD25+ cells in peripheral blood as well as a 9.7 median fold increase in FOXP3 expression in CD3+ T cells. CD56+CD3- natural killer (NK) cells also expanded during IL-2 therapy but did not express FOXP3. In vitro treatment of NK cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored the IL-2 signaling pathway leading to FOXP3 expression, suggesting that this gene was constitutively repressed by DNA methylation in these cells.

DNA methylation changes after 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine therapy in patients with leukemia.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2006-05-01,"5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) is postulated to have clinical activity in myeloid leukemias via its ability to inhibit DNA methylation. To study this, we examined DNA methylation in patients with leukemia treated with decitabine. Five days after the treatment, total genomic 5-methylcytosine/cytosine decreased on average by 14% (from 4.3% to 3.7%), whereas methylation of repetitive DNA elements showed a mean decrease of 9% and 16% for Alu and long interspersed nucleotide elements, respectively. Methylation decreased linearly with increasing doses between 5 and 20 mg/m(2)/d (r = 0.88; P = 0.05) but showed a plateau above that. Hypomethylation correlated with response in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia treated with low doses (5-20 mg/m(2)/d), but patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with high doses (100-180 mg/m(2)/d) showed no such correlation. Aberrant methylation of p15 (>10%) was found in 27% of patients, and 80% of these showed a decrease by at least one third, but this did not correlate with response.

Survival benefit with imatinib mesylate versus interferon-alpha-based regimens in newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2006-05-18,"A survival benefit for imatinib mesylate versus interferon-alpha therapy could not be demonstrated in the randomized study in newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) due to the high rate of crossover (90%) from interferon-alpha to imatinib mesylate within a year of study entry. We compared survival in 279 patients with newly diagnosed CML treated with imatinib mesylate at our institution (2000-2004) to 650 patients treated with interferon-alpha (1982-1997). The complete cytogenetic response rates were 87% with imatinib mesylate and 28% with interferon-alpha (P < .001). The estimated 3-year survival rates were 96% with imatinib mesylate and 81% with interferon-alpha (P < .01).

Activation of the mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 1 by arsenic trioxide.,The Journal of biological chemistry,J. Biol. Chem.,2006-06-08,"Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) is a potent inducer of apoptosis of leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo, but the precise mechanisms by which it mediates such effects are not well defined. We provide evidence that As2O3 induces activation of the mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 1 (MSK1) and downstream phosphorylation of its substrate, histone H3, in leukemia cell lines. Such activation requires upstream engagement of p38 MAPK, as demonstrated by experiments using pharmacological inhibitors of p38 or p38alpha knock-out cells. Arsenic-induced apoptosis was enhanced in cells in which MSK1 expression was decreased using small interfering RNA and in Msk1 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting that this kinase is activated in a negative feedback regulatory manner to regulate As2O3 responses. Consistent with this, pharmacological inhibition of MSK1 enhanced the suppressive effects of As2O3 on the growth of primary leukemic progenitors from chronic myelogenous leukemia patients.

We evaluated dasatinib, a BCR-ABL inhibitor that targets most imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations, in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Patients with various phases of CML or with Ph-positive ALL who could not tolerate or were resistant to imatinib were enrolled in a phase 1 dose-escalation study. Dasatinib (15 to 240 mg per day) was administered orally in four-week treatment cycles, once or twice daily. A complete hematologic response was achieved in 37 of 40 patients with chronic-phase CML, and major hematologic responses were seen in 31 of 44 patients with accelerated-phase CML, CML with blast crisis, or Ph-positive ALL. In these two phases, the rates of major cytogenetic response were 45 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Responses were maintained in 95 percent of patients with chronic-phase disease and in 82 percent of patients with accelerated-phase disease, with a median follow-up more than 12 months and 5 months, respectively. Nearly all patients with lymphoid blast crisis and Ph-positive ALL had a relapse within six months. Responses occurred among all BCR-ABL genotypes, with the exception of the T315I mutation, which confers resistance to both dasatinib and imatinib in vitro. Myelosuppression was common but not dose-limiting. Dasatinib induces hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with CML or Ph-positive ALL who cannot tolerate or are resistant to imatinib.

Pegylated interferon therapy for patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative disorders.,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,Semin. Thromb. Hemost.,2006-06-01,"The conventional management of patients with high-risk Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-negative) myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) revolves around the administration of cytoreductive agents such as hydroxyurea, anagrelide, and recombinant human interferon alpha (IFN-alpha). IFN-alpha has shown significant activity in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Ph-negative MDPs. However, the response rates of IFN-alpha therapy frequently have been hampered by high dropout rates due to side effects and inconvenient dosing schedules. Pegylated (PEG) IFN-alpha is formulated by covalently attaching polymers of ethylene glycol of large molecular weight to the native IFN-alpha molecule.

Role of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in the generation of arsenic trioxide-dependent cellular responses.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2006-07-01,"Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) induces differentiation and apoptosis of leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo, but the precise mechanisms that mediate such effects are not known. In the present study, we provide evidence that the kinases MAPK kinase 3 (Mkk3) and Mkk6 are activated during treatment of leukemic cell lines with As(2)O(3) to regulate downstream engagement of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Using cells with targeted disruption of both the Mkk3 and Mkk6 genes, we show that As(2)O(3)-dependent activation of p38 is defective in the absence of Mkk3 and Mkk6, establishing that these kinases are essential for As(2)O(3)-dependent engagement of the p38 pathway. Pharmacologic inhibition of p38 enhances As(2)O(3)-dependent activation of the c-jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) and subsequent induction of apoptosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)- or acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)-derived cell lines. In addition, in APL blasts, inhibition of p38 enhances myeloid cell differentiation in response to As(2)O(3), as well as suppression of Bcl-2 expression and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Similarly, induction of As(2)O(3)-dependent apoptosis is enhanced in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) with targeted disruption of both the Mkk3 and Mkk6 genes, establishing a key role for this pathway in the regulation of As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis. In other studies, we show that the small-molecule p38 inhibitors SD-282 and SCIO-469 potentiate As(2)O(3)-mediated suppression of myeloid leukemic progenitor growth from CML patients, indicating a critical regulatory role for p38 in the induction of antileukemic responses.

Reversible peripartum cardiomyopathy in a patient with prior exposure to interferon.,American journal of therapeutics,Am J Ther,,"Peripartum cardiomyopathy creates complications for 1 in 3000 to 4000 pregnant women in the US. As this rare condition is associated with a high mortality rate (50% to 85%), it has been investigated to define the possible associated causes. Several factors including hypertension, nutritional and dietary discrepancies, and, recently, myocarditis are being implicated, but the mechanism of cardiac injury is yet to be discovered. Here we present an interesting case of possible interferon-induced reversible peripartum cardiomyopathy. The patient, with a diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia, had been given interferon for 6 years. The therapy was discontinued when she became pregnant, and later she presented with symptoms of heart failure 6 weeks after her c-section. Interferon is an immunomodulating agent and used as an antiviral and an anticancer agent. Interferon-related dilated cardiomyopathy has been described as a rare side effect of the drug, the mechanism of which is unknown. There is compelling data supporting the fact that both peripartum cardiomyopathy and interferon-related cardiomyopathy are autoimmune disorders; so it is suggested that interferon therapy given in the past can have an additive effect in causing dilated cardiomyopathy. It is therefore advisable to follow closely those pregnant patients; who received interferon therapy in the past, for symptoms of cardiac failure, as there can be synergistic action between interferon and pregnancy causing dilated cardiomyopathy.",Case Reports,,0.0,Peripartum cardiomyopathy creates complications for 1 in 3000 to 4000 pregnant women in the US As this rare condition is associated with a high mortality rate 50 to 85 it has been investigated to define the possible associated causes Several factors including hypertension nutritional and dietary discrepancies and recently myocarditis are being implicated but the mechanism of injury is yet to be discovered Here we present an interesting case of possible interferon-induced reversible peripartum cardiomyopathy The patient with a diagnosis of chronic myelogenous had been given interferon for 6 years The therapy was discontinued when she became pregnant and later she presented with symptoms of failure 6 weeks after her c-section Interferon is an immunomodulating agent and used as an antiviral and an anticancer agent Interferon-related dilated cardiomyopathy has been described as a rare side effect of the drug the mechanism of which is unknown There is compelling data supporting the fact that both peripartum cardiomyopathy and interferon-related cardiomyopathy are autoimmune disorders so it is suggested that interferon therapy given in the past can have an additive effect in causing dilated cardiomyopathy It is therefore advisable to follow closely those pregnant patients who received interferon therapy in the past for symptoms of failure as there can be synergistic action between interferon and pregnancy causing dilated cardiomyopathy,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"[21399, 6460, 9803, 521, 9, 14, 4, 11264, 6, 10660, 6086, 117, 4, 3, 843, 22, 26, 622, 2850, 16, 41, 5, 8, 64, 282, 116, 212, 6, 772, 192, 71, 85, 565, 6, 1107, 3, 899, 41, 1626, 392, 130, 141, 1824, 5082, 2, 2013, 7631, 2, 761, 15329, 32, 486, 1771, 84, 3, 670, 1, 2730, 16, 1145, 6, 40, 2747, 467, 21, 364, 35, 6597, 473, 1, 899, 1688, 277, 2786, 21399, 6460, 3, 69, 5, 8, 147, 1, 442, 2194, 42, 85, 447, 1688, 9, 49, 60, 3, 36, 10, 2402, 198, 3109, 3451, 6086, 2, 1559, 3109, 917, 5, 507, 1, 496, 49, 244, 50, 1084, 256, 2917, 1688, 16, 35, 13861, 420, 2, 95, 22, 35, 6264, 2, 35, 1475, 420, 1688, 139, 11536, 6460, 71, 85, 1027, 22, 8, 622, 1152, 254, 1, 3, 234, 3, 670, 1, 92, 16, 860, 125, 16, 6051, 74, 1912, 3, 1991, 17, 110, 21399, 6460, 2, 1688, 139, 6460, 32, 3445, 1997, 1743, 192, 16, 1148, 17, 1688, 36, 447, 4, 3, 1219, 122, 47, 35, 3396, 254, 4, 3440, 11536, 6460, 192, 16, 673, 19443, 6, 166, 3210, 135, 6086, 7, 54, 103, 1688, 36, 4, 3, 1219, 9, 507, 1, 496, 22, 125, 122, 40, 1806, 1578, 59, 1688, 2, 2290, 3440, 11536, 6460]",1453.0,16858174,134

An unconventional antigen translated by a novel internal ribosome entry site elicits antitumor humoral immune reactions.,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",J. Immunol.,2006-10-01,"Self-tumor Ags that elicit antitumor immune responses in responses to IFN-alpha stimulation remain poorly defined. We screened a human testis cDNA library with sera from three polycythemia vera patients who responded to IFN-alpha and identified a novel Ag, MPD6. MPD6 belongs to the group of cryptic Ags without conventional genomic structure and is encoded by a cryptic open reading frame located in the 3'-untranslated region of myotrophin mRNA. MPD6 elicits IgG Ab responses in a subset of polycythemia vera patients, as well as patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and prostate cancer, suggesting that it is broadly immunogenic. The expression of myotrophin-MPD6 transcripts was up-regulated in some tumor cells, but only slightly increased in K562 cells in response to IFN-alpha treatment. By using bicistronic reporter constructs, we showed that the translation of MPD6 was mediated by a novel internal ribosome entry site (IRES) upstream of the MPD6 reading frame. Furthermore, the MPD6-IRES-mediated translation, but not myotrophin-MPD6 transcription, was significantly up-regulated in response to IFN-alpha stimulation. These findings demonstrate that a novel IRES-mediated mechanism may be responsible for the translation of unconventional self-Ag MPD6 in responsive to IFN-alpha stimulation.

Beneficial effects of combining nilotinib and imatinib in preclinical models of BCR-ABL+ leukemias.,Blood,Blood,2006-10-26,"Drug resistance resulting from emergence of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL point mutations is a significant problem in advanced-stage chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The BCR-ABL inhibitor, nilotinib (AMN107), is significantly more potent against BCR-ABL than imatinib, and is active against many imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants. Phase 1/2 clinical trials show that nilotinib can induce remissions in patients who have previously failed imatinib, indicating that sequential therapy with these 2 agents has clinical value. However, simultaneous, rather than sequential, administration of 2 BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors is attractive for many reasons, including the theoretical possibility that this could reduce emergence of drug-resistant clones. Here, we show that exposure of a variety of BCR-ABL+ cell lines to imatinib and nilotinib results in additive or synergistic cytotoxicity, including testing of a large panel of cells expressing BCR-ABL point mutations causing resistance to imatinib in patients. Further, using a highly quantifiable bioluminescent in vivo model, drug combinations were at least additive in antileukemic activity, compared with each drug alone. These results suggest that despite binding to the same site in the same target kinase, the combination of imatinib and nilotinib is highly efficacious in these models, indicating that clinical testing of combinations of BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors is warranted.",Journal Article,4835.0,74.0,Drug resistance resulting from emergence of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL point mutations is a significant problem in advanced-stage chronic myelogenous CML The BCR-ABL inhibitor nilotinib AMN107 is significantly more potent against BCR-ABL than imatinib and is active against many imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants Phase 1/2 clinical trials show that nilotinib can induce remissions in patients who have previously failed imatinib indicating that sequential therapy with these 2 agents has clinical value However simultaneous rather than sequential administration of 2 BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors is attractive for many reasons including the theoretical possibility that this could reduce emergence of drug-resistant clones Here we show that exposure of a variety of BCR-ABL+ cell lines to imatinib and nilotinib results in additive or synergistic cytotoxicity including testing of a large panel of cells expressing BCR-ABL point mutations causing resistance to imatinib in patients Further using a highly quantifiable bioluminescent in vivo model drug combinations were at least additive in antileukemic activity compared with each drug alone These results suggest that despite binding to the same site in the same target kinase the combination of imatinib and nilotinib is highly efficacious in these models indicating that clinical testing of combinations of BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors is warranted,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[234, 251, 1113, 29, 3397, 1, 577, 436, 1062, 1425, 741, 138, 16, 8, 93, 2497, 4, 131, 82, 442, 2194, 903, 3, 1062, 1425, 230, 2638, 12189, 16, 97, 80, 1157, 480, 1062, 1425, 76, 577, 2, 16, 544, 480, 445, 577, 436, 1062, 1425, 3423, 124, 14, 18, 38, 143, 514, 17, 2638, 122, 1290, 3166, 4, 7, 54, 47, 373, 1551, 577, 1716, 17, 1787, 36, 5, 46, 18, 183, 71, 38, 549, 137, 2824, 1832, 76, 1787, 634, 1, 18, 1062, 1425, 216, 222, 16, 3059, 9, 445, 2325, 141, 3, 7060, 2526, 17, 26, 359, 969, 3397, 1, 234, 436, 2749, 467, 21, 514, 17, 645, 1, 8, 1362, 1, 1062, 1425, 31, 285, 6, 577, 2, 2638, 99, 4, 3396, 15, 1806, 1408, 141, 471, 1, 8, 375, 993, 1, 37, 1046, 1062, 1425, 741, 138, 3440, 251, 6, 577, 4, 7, 195, 75, 8, 561, 11639, 12571, 4, 386, 202, 234, 1247, 11, 28, 506, 3396, 4, 4512, 128, 72, 5, 296, 234, 279, 46, 99, 309, 17, 550, 791, 6, 3, 827, 606, 4, 3, 827, 283, 216, 3, 150, 1, 577, 2, 2638, 16, 561, 3289, 4, 46, 274, 1716, 17, 38, 471, 1, 1247, 1, 1062, 1425, 216, 222, 16, 1197]",1397.0,17068153,145
Activation of mammalian target of rapamycin and the p70 S6 kinase by arsenic trioxide in BCR-ABL-expressing cells.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2006-11-01,"Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) exhibits important antitumor activities in vitro and in vivo, but the precise mechanisms by which it induces its effects are not known. We provide evidence that during treatment of BCR-ABL-expressing cells with As(2)O(3), there is activation of a cellular pathway involving the p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K). Our data show that p70S6K is rapidly phosphorylated on Thr(421) and Ser(424) and is activated in an As(2)O(3)-inducible manner. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is also phosphorylated/activated in an As(2)O(3)-inducible manner, and its activity is required for downstream engagement of p70S6K. p70S6K subsequently phosphorylates the S6 ribosomal protein on Ser(235)/Ser(236) and Ser(240)/Ser(244) to promote initiation of mRNA translation. Treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia-derived cell lines with As(2)O(3) also results in phosphorylation of the 4E-BP1 repressor of mRNA translation on Thr(37)/Thr(46) and Thr(70), sites required for its deactivation and its dissociation from the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E complex to allow cap-dependent mRNA translation. In studies to determine the functional relevance of this pathway, we found that inhibition of mTOR and downstream cascades enhances induction of apoptosis by As(2)O(3). Consistent with this, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin strongly potentiated As(2)O(3)-mediated suppression of primitive leukemic progenitors from the bone marrow of chronic myelogenous leukemia patients. Altogether, our data show that the mTOR/p70S6K pathway is activated in a negative feedback regulatory manner in response to As(2)O(3) in BCR-ABL-transformed cells and plays a key regulatory role in the induction of anti-leukemic responses.",Journal Article,4829.0,24.0,Arsenic trioxide As 2 O 3 exhibits important antitumor activities in vitro and in vivo but the precise mechanisms by which it induces its effects are not known We provide evidence that during treatment of BCR-ABL-expressing cells with As 2 O 3 there is activation of a cellular pathway involving the p70 S6 kinase p70S6K Our data show that p70S6K is rapidly phosphorylated on Thr 421 and Ser 424 and is activated in an As 2 O 3 -inducible manner The mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR is also phosphorylated/activated in an As 2 O 3 -inducible manner and its activity is required for downstream engagement of p70S6K p70S6K subsequently phosphorylates the S6 ribosomal protein on Ser 235 /Ser 236 and Ser 240 /Ser 244 to promote initiation of mRNA translation Treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia-derived cell lines with As 2 O 3 also results in phosphorylation of the 4E-BP1 repressor of mRNA translation on Thr 37 /Thr 46 and Thr 70 sites required for its deactivation and its dissociation from the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E complex to allow cap-dependent mRNA translation In studies to determine the functional relevance of this pathway we found that inhibition of mTOR and downstream cascades enhances induction of apoptosis by As 2 O 3 Consistent with this the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin strongly potentiated As 2 O 3 -mediated suppression of primitive leukemic progenitors from the marrow of chronic myelogenous patients Altogether our data show that the mTOR/p70S6K pathway is activated in a negative feedback regulatory manner in response to As 2 O 3 in BCR-ABL-transformed cells and plays a key regulatory role in the induction of anti-leukemic responses,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3217, 4574, 22, 18, 1990, 27, 4273, 305, 579, 2042, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 84, 3, 3260, 483, 20, 92, 192, 1516, 211, 176, 32, 44, 440, 21, 377, 241, 17, 190, 24, 1, 1062, 1425, 1046, 37, 5, 22, 18, 1990, 27, 125, 16, 363, 1, 8, 763, 308, 1267, 3, 9036, 4977, 216, 8066, 114, 74, 514, 17, 8066, 16, 1755, 2365, 23, 11105, 9664, 2, 6963, 12364, 2, 16, 735, 4, 35, 22, 18, 1990, 27, 2877, 1708, 3, 2359, 283, 1, 1620, 873, 16, 120, 2365, 735, 4, 35, 22, 18, 1990, 27, 2877, 1708, 2, 211, 128, 16, 616, 9, 1489, 5103, 1, 8066, 8066, 1611, 12528, 3, 4977, 8194, 178, 23, 6963, 6465, 6963, 6383, 2, 6963, 4263, 6963, 6567, 6, 1617, 1118, 1, 956, 2691, 24, 1, 442, 2194, 2647, 526, 31, 285, 5, 22, 18, 1990, 27, 120, 99, 4, 982, 1, 3, 6726, 7949, 7434, 1, 956, 2691, 23, 11105, 567, 11105, 641, 2, 11105, 431, 633, 616, 9, 211, 30663, 2, 211, 10443, 29, 3, 8374, 1118, 161, 6726, 840, 6, 1700, 3204, 470, 956, 2691, 4, 94, 6, 223, 3, 583, 2088, 1, 26, 308, 21, 204, 17, 297, 1, 873, 2, 1489, 8036, 2519, 504, 1, 351, 20, 22, 18, 1990, 27, 925, 5, 26, 3, 873, 230, 1620, 1327, 6707, 22, 18, 1990, 27, 517, 1332, 1, 5594, 2015, 4321, 29, 3, 581, 1, 442, 2194, 7, 6767, 114, 74, 514, 17, 3, 873, 8066, 308, 16, 735, 4, 8, 199, 3983, 1253, 1708, 4, 51, 6, 22, 18, 1990, 27, 4, 1062, 1425, 2423, 37, 2, 1698, 8, 825, 1253, 200, 4, 3, 504, 1, 312, 2015, 253]",1671.0,17121928,43
"Clinical cancer advances 2006: major research advances in cancer treatment, prevention, and screening--a report from the American Society of Clinical Oncology.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2006-12-08,"A MESSAGE FROM ASCO's PRESIDENT For the second consecutive year, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) is publishing Clinical Cancer Advances: Major Research Advances in Cancer Treatment, Prevention, and Screening, an annual review of the most significant cancer research presented or published over the past year. ASCO developed this report to demonstrate the enormous progress being made on the front lines of cancer research today. The report is intended to give all those with an interest in cancer care-the general public, cancer patients and physicians, policymakers, oncologists, and other medical professionals-an accessible summary of the year's most important cancer research advances. These pages report on new targeted therapies that are improving survival and response rates in hard-to-treat cancers such as kidney cancer, HER-2-positive breast cancer, head and neck cancer, and chronic myelogenous leukemia; the FDA's approval of the world's first preventive vaccine for human papillomavirus (HPV), which has the potential to dramatically reduce the global burden of cervical cancer; and advances in the fast-growing field of personalized medicine, including a new lung cancer test that could help physicians better target treatments and predict prognosis. These advances are only part of the landscape. Survival rates are on the rise, the number of cancer deaths in the United States began declining for the first time since 1930, and new research is showing that the rates of certain common cancers, such as those of the breast and colon, have stabilized, and may have even begun to decline. However, cancer research still faces a number of major obstacles. At a time of extraordinary scientific potential, declining federal funding of cancer research threatens to stall or even reverse recent progress.

Inhibition of CXCR4 with the novel RCP168 peptide overcomes stroma-mediated chemoresistance in chronic and acute leukemias.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2006-12-01,"The chemokine receptor CXCR4 mediates the migration of hematopoietic cells to the stroma-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha)-producing bone marrow microenvironment. Using peptide-based CXCR4 inhibitors derived from the chemokine viral macrophage inflammatory protein II, we tested the hypothesis that the inhibition of CXCR4 increases sensitivity to chemotherapy by interfering with stromal/leukemia cell interactions. First, leukemic cells expressing varying amounts of surface CXCR4 were examined for their chemotactic response to SDF-1alpha or stromal cells, alone or in the presence of different CXCR4 inhibitors. Results showed that the polypeptide RCP168 had the strongest antagonistic effect on the SDF-1alpha- or stromal cell-induced chemotaxis of leukemic cells. Furthermore, RCP168 blocked the binding of anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody 12G5 to surface CXCR4 in a concentration-dependent manner and inhibited SDF-1alpha-induced AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. Finally, RCP168 significantly enhanced chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in stroma-cocultured Jurkat, primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and in a subset of acute myelogenous leukemia cells harboring Flt3 mutation. Equivalent results were obtained with the small-molecule CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3465. Our data therefore suggest that the SDF-1alpha/CXCR4 interaction contributes to the resistance of leukemia cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Disruption of these interactions by the peptide CXCR4 inhibitor RCP168 represents a novel strategy for targeting leukemic cells within the bone marrow microenvironment.",Journal Article,4799.0,141.0,The chemokine receptor CXCR4 mediates the migration of hematopoietic cells to the stroma-derived factor 1alpha SDF-1alpha -producing marrow microenvironment Using peptide-based CXCR4 inhibitors derived from the chemokine viral macrophage inflammatory protein II we tested the hypothesis that the inhibition of CXCR4 increases sensitivity to chemotherapy by interfering with stromal/leukemia cell interactions First leukemic cells expressing varying amounts of surface CXCR4 were examined for their chemotactic response to SDF-1alpha or stromal cells alone or in the presence of different CXCR4 inhibitors Results showed that the polypeptide RCP168 had the strongest antagonistic effect on the SDF-1alpha- or stromal cell-induced chemotaxis of leukemic cells Furthermore RCP168 blocked the binding of anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody 12G5 to surface CXCR4 in a concentration-dependent manner and inhibited SDF-1alpha-induced AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation Finally RCP168 significantly enhanced chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in stroma-cocultured Jurkat primary chronic lymphocytic and in a subset of acute myelogenous cells harboring Flt3 mutation Equivalent results were obtained with the small-molecule CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3465 Our data therefore suggest that the SDF-1alpha/CXCR4 interaction contributes to the resistance of cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis Disruption of these interactions by the peptide CXCR4 inhibitor RCP168 represents a novel strategy for targeting leukemic cells within the marrow microenvironment,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 3596, 153, 2318, 3961, 3, 1381, 1, 1007, 37, 6, 3, 2477, 526, 161, 5018, 5524, 5018, 3787, 581, 995, 75, 1389, 90, 2318, 222, 526, 29, 3, 3596, 1667, 2674, 1291, 178, 215, 21, 650, 3, 1492, 17, 3, 297, 1, 2318, 1106, 485, 6, 56, 20, 3449, 5, 1126, 2647, 31, 1286, 157, 2015, 37, 1046, 2990, 4939, 1, 1255, 2318, 11, 409, 9, 136, 15279, 51, 6, 5524, 5018, 15, 1126, 37, 279, 15, 4, 3, 463, 1, 338, 2318, 222, 99, 224, 17, 3, 8720, 34192, 42, 3, 3311, 9863, 254, 23, 3, 5524, 5018, 15, 1126, 31, 277, 12561, 1, 2015, 37, 798, 34192, 2582, 3, 791, 1, 312, 2318, 848, 548, 55947, 6, 1255, 2318, 4, 8, 1227, 470, 1708, 2, 879, 5524, 5018, 277, 649, 2, 1976, 1235, 1065, 216, 982, 1368, 34192, 97, 651, 56, 277, 351, 4, 2477, 11444, 8433, 86, 442, 1193, 2, 4, 8, 697, 1, 286, 2194, 37, 2105, 1224, 258, 2017, 99, 11, 683, 5, 3, 302, 1354, 2318, 230, 20532, 114, 74, 673, 309, 17, 3, 5524, 5018, 2318, 915, 2444, 6, 3, 251, 1, 37, 6, 56, 277, 351, 3220, 1, 46, 1286, 20, 3, 1389, 2318, 230, 34192, 1449, 8, 229, 692, 9, 529, 2015, 37, 262, 3, 581, 995]",1557.0,17172414,254
Phase II study of low-dose decitabine in combination with imatinib mesylate in patients with accelerated or myeloid blastic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2007-03-01,"Resistance to imatinib is a frequent clinical problem in advanced phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). A Phase II study was performed on low-dose decitabine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, in combination with imatinib in patients with CML in accelerated phase (AP) and myeloid blastic phase (BP). Patients received decitabine 15 mg/m(2) intravenously daily, 5 days a week for 2 weeks, and imatinib 600 mg orally daily. Global DNA methylation was measured by long interspersed nucleotide element (LINE) bisulfite/pyrosequencing. Twenty-eight patients were enrolled (25 with imatinib resistance; 18 in AP, 10 in BP). A total of 91 cycles (median, 2.5 cycles per patient) was administered. Complete hematologic responses, partial hematologic responses, and hematologic improvement were observed in 9 (32%), 1 (4%), and 2 (7%) patients. Major and minor cytogenetic responses were observed in 5 (18%) and 3 (11%) patients. The hematologic response rate was higher in patients without BCR-ABL kinase mutations (10 of 19, 53%) than in those with mutations (1 of 7, 14%). Median duration of hematologic response was 18 (range, 4 to 107+) weeks. Myelosuppression was the major adverse effect, with neutropenic fever in 9 patients (32%). LINE methylation decreased from 71.6% +/- 0.9% (mean +/- standard error of the mean) to 60.4% +/- 2.0% on Day 5, 60.5% +/- 1.8% on Day 12, and returned to 68.8% +/- 1.4% at peripheral blood recovery. A decrease in LINE methylation tended to be greater in nonresponders than in responders on Days 5 and 12.

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2007-02-01,"Results of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) to treat advanced leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) remain poor due to excessive relapse and transplant-related mortality. To improve transplant outcome in this patient population, 43 patients (median age, 46.1 years) with high-risk or advanced lymphoid (n = 5) or myeloid malignancy (n = 38) were prospectively enrolled on a pilot trial of cytoreduction with intravenous busulfan and melphalan followed by an unmodified HLA-A, -B, and -DRbeta1-matched related (n = 18) or unrelated (n = 25) HCT. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and methotrexate. Thirty-four patients had > or = 5% blasts at the time of HCT; 12 of these had > 20% blasts. Seventeen patients had unfavorable cytogenetics, 8 patients underwent transplantation for secondary MDS or acute myelogenous leukemia, and 4 patients had relapsed after a previous allogeneic transplantation. Although mucositis was the most significant regimen-related toxicity, requiring the addition of folinic acid rescue and failure to receive all 4 doses of methotrexate in 23 patients, the nonrelapse mortality at 30 and 100 days was low at 0% and 16%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD was 24%, and that of extensive chronic GVHD was 7%.

Growth factor stimulation reduces residual quiescent chronic myelogenous leukemia progenitors remaining after imatinib treatment.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2007-02-01,"The BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate is highly effective in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) but fails to eliminate all leukemia cells. Residual leukemia stem and progenitor cells persist in imatinib-responsive patients and may be a potential source of relapse. Previous studies indicate that imatinib preferentially targets dividing cells, and nondividing progenitor cells are resistant to imatinib-mediated apoptosis. We investigated whether growth factor stimulation of progenitor proliferation could reduce the number of residual nondividing cells remaining after imatinib treatment. CML and normal CD34(+) cells were labeled with 5-(and 6-)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) to track cell division and cultured in low or high concentrations of growth factor to determine effects of growth factor stimulation on nondividing cells. High growth factor concentrations significantly enhanced CML proliferation with or without imatinib treatment and significantly reduced the number of viable, nondividing CFSE bright cells remaining after imatinib exposure. Stimulation with high growth factor before imatinib treatment further reduced the number of residual nondividing CML CD34(+) cells. Importantly, clinically achievable concentrations of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor alone or in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor also significantly reduced nondividing CML CD34(+) cells.

New targeted therapies for chronic myelogenous leukemia: opportunities to overcome imatinib resistance.,Seminars in hematology,Semin. Hematol.,2007-01-01,"The advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has ushered in a new era in the management of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Imatinib, the first TKI to be approved for the treatment of CML and the current standard first-line therapy, has significantly improved the prognosis of patients with CML. Nevertheless, a minority of patients in chronic-phase CML and even more patients with advanced-phase disease demonstrate resistance to imatinib or develop resistance during treatment. In 40% to 50% of cases, this is attributed to the development of mutations that impair the ability of imatinib to bind to and inhibit the constitutively active Bcr-Abl kinase. Consequently, researchers have developed novel, more potent TKIs that can overcome not only Bcr-Abl-dependent mechanisms of resistance, but also those that are Bcr-Abl-independent. These include: dasatinib, a potent dual Bcr-Abl and Src inhibitor; nilotinib, a selective, potent Bcr-Abl inhibitor; bosutinib (SKI-606) and INNO-406 (NS-187), which are both Src-Abl inhibitors; and others. Combination therapy is also being explored concurrently using agents that affect a variety of oncogenic pathways and immune modulation.

Important therapeutic targets in chronic myelogenous leukemia.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2007-02-01,"Review the state-of-art knowledge of the biology and therapy of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). A review of the literature was undertaken to summarize current information on the pathophysiology of CML and to update data of imatinib mesylate therapy, mechanisms of resistance, and in vitro and clinical data with the new tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Imatinib, which targets the ABL kinase activity of BCR-ABL, has prolonged survival in CML. Despite the efficacy of imatinib, some patients in chronic phase and more in advanced phases of CML develop resistance, frequently as a result of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase domain mutants that impair imatinib binding but retain enzymatic activity. New tyrosine kinase inhibitors inhibit BCR-ABL more potently than imatinib and maintain activity against an array of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants. The IC(50) values of nilotinib and dasatinib are at least 10- to 100-fold lower for BCR-ABL compared with imatinib. Phase I-II trials of nilotinib and dasatinib showed high activity in imatinib-resistant CML and Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL. Dasatinib also inhibits members of the Src family of kinases (SFKs); nilotinib does not. Whether SFKs have a critical role in imatinib resistance or BCR-ABL-mediated oncogenesis is unresolved.

Comparative gene expression analysis of a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line resistant to cyclophosphamide using oligonucleotide arrays and response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.,Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2007-04-02,"Acquired imatinib resistance in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) can be the consequence of mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL or increased protein levels. However, as in other malignancies, acquired resistance to cytostatic drugs is a common reason for treatment failure or disease progression. As a model for drug resistance, we developed a CML cell line resistant to cyclophosphamide (CP). Using oligonucleotide arrays, we examined changes in global gene expression. Selected genes were also examined by real-time PCR and flow cytometry. Neither the parent nor the resistant lines had mutations in their ATP binding domain. Filtering genes with a low-base line expression, a total of 239 genes showed significant changes (162 up- and 77 down-regulated) in the resistant clone. Most of the up-regulated genes were associated with metabolism, signal transduction, or encoded enzymes. The gene for aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 was over-expressed more than 2000-fold in the resistant clone. BCR-ABL was expressed in both cell lines to a comparable extent. When exposed to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib and nilotinib, both lines were sensitive. In conclusion, we found multiple genetic changes in a CML cell line resistant to CP related to metabolism, signal transduction or apoptosis.

The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib induces apoptosis in highly imatinib mesylate-resistant bcr/abl+ human leukemia cells in association with signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 inhibition and myeloid cell leukemia-1 down-regulation.,Molecular pharmacology,Mol. Pharmacol.,2007-06-26,"The effects of the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib (BAY 43-9006), an agent shown previously to induce apoptosis in human leukemia cells through inhibition of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) translation, have been examined in Bcr/Abl(+) leukemia cells resistant to imatinib mesylate (IM). When administered at pharmacologically relevant concentrations (10-15 microM), sorafenib potently induced apoptosis in imatinib mesylate-resistant cells expressing high levels of Bcr/Abl, cells exhibiting a Bcr/Abl-independent, Lyn-dependent form of resistance, and CD34(+) cells obtained from imatinib-resistant patients. In addition, Ba/F3 cells expressing mutations rendering them resistant to IM (e.g., E255K, M351T) or to IM, dasatinib, and nilotinib (T315I) remained fully sensitive to sorafenib. Induction of apoptosis by sorafenib was associated with rapid and pronounced down-regulation of Mcl-1 and diminished signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5 phosphorylation and reporter activity but only very modest and delayed inactivation of the Bcr/Abl downstream target Crkl. Moreover, transfection with a constitutively active STAT5 construct partially but significantly protected cells from sorafenib lethality.

Finally, stable knockdown of Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death (Bim) with short hairpin RNA in K562 cells significantly diminished sorafenib lethality, arguing strongly for a functional role of this proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member in the lethality of this agent.

Ras as a therapeutic target in hematologic malignancies.,Expert opinion on emerging drugs,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs,2007-05-01,"The RAS gene product is normally a membrane-localized G protein (N-Ras, K-Ras and H-Ras) of 21 kDa classically described as a molecular off/on switch. It is inactive when bound to guanosine diphosphate and active when bound to GTP. When mutated, the gene produces an abnormal protein resistant to GTP hydrolysis by GTPase, resulting in a constitutively active GTP-bound protein that stimulates a critical network of signal transduction pathways that lead to cellular proliferation, survival and differentiation. At least three downstream effector pathways have been described, including Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT and RalGDS, but they are not completely understood. Ras pathways are also important downstream effectors of several receptor tyrosine kinases localized in the cell membrane, most notably the BCR-ABL fusion protein seen in patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia. An important consideration in designing strategies to block Ras stimulatory effect is that Ras proteins are synthesized in the cytosol, but require post-translational modifications and attachment to anchor proteins or membrane binding sites in the cell membrane to be biologically active. Farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) are probably the best-studied class of Ras inhibitors in hematologic malignancies. They block the enzyme farnesyl-transferase (FTase), which is essential for post-translational modification. However, it has been observed that the Ras proteins also can be geranylgeranylated in the presence of FTIs, thus allowing membrane localization and activation, which limits their effectiveness. It is now hypothesized that their mechanism of action may be through FTase inhibition involving other signal transduction pathways. S-trans, trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid, which was first designed as a prenylated protein methyltransferase inhibitor, has shown in vitro activity against all activated Ras proteins by dislodging them from their membrane-anchoring sites. Here, Ras biology, its signaling pathways and its implications as a therapeutic target in hematologic malignancies are reviewed.",Journal Article,4648.0,28.0,The RAS gene product is normally a membrane-localized G protein N-Ras K-Ras and H-Ras of 21 kDa classically described as a molecular off/on switch It is inactive when bound to guanosine diphosphate and active when bound to GTP When mutated the gene produces an abnormal protein resistant to GTP hydrolysis by GTPase resulting in a constitutively active GTP-bound protein that stimulates a critical network of signal transduction pathways that lead to cellular proliferation survival and differentiation At least three downstream effector pathways have been described including Raf/MEK/ERK PI3K/AKT and RalGDS but they are not completely understood Ras pathways are also important downstream effectors of several receptor tyrosine kinases localized in the cell membrane most notably the BCR-ABL fusion protein seen in patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous An important consideration in designing strategies to block Ras stimulatory effect is that Ras proteins are synthesized in the cytosol but require post-translational modifications and attachment to anchor proteins or membrane binding sites in the cell membrane to be biologically active Farnesyl transferase inhibitors FTIs are probably the best-studied class of Ras inhibitors in hematologic malignancies They block the enzyme farnesyl-transferase FTase which is essential for post-translational modification However it has been observed that the Ras proteins also can be geranylgeranylated in the presence of FTIs thus allowing membrane localization and activation which limits their effectiveness It is now hypothesized that their mechanism of action may be through FTase inhibition involving other signal transduction pathways S-trans trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid which was first designed as a prenylated protein methyltransferase inhibitor has shown in vitro activity against all activated Ras proteins by dislodging them from their membrane-anchoring sites Here Ras biology its signaling pathways and its implications as a therapeutic target in hematologic malignancies are reviewed,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1102, 145, 2821, 16, 6150, 8, 1905, 909, 499, 178, 78, 1102, 1634, 1102, 2, 555, 1102, 1, 239, 6362, 9260, 1027, 22, 8, 219, 1889, 23, 5096, 192, 16, 5002, 198, 2951, 6, 14478, 8762, 2, 544, 198, 2951, 6, 9969, 198, 1185, 3, 145, 4042, 35, 1668, 178, 436, 6, 9969, 15205, 20, 9189, 1113, 4, 8, 2818, 544, 9969, 2951, 178, 17, 6200, 8, 740, 1801, 1, 1235, 2761, 460, 17, 1122, 6, 763, 457, 25, 2, 910, 28, 506, 169, 1489, 2070, 460, 47, 85, 1027, 141, 2212, 1693, 1819, 974, 649, 2, 56365, 84, 491, 32, 44, 2500, 1784, 1102, 460, 32, 120, 305, 1489, 4926, 1, 392, 153, 564, 1549, 909, 4, 3, 31, 1905, 96, 2552, 3, 1062, 1425, 1212, 178, 527, 4, 7, 5, 3006, 1170, 109, 442, 2194, 35, 305, 2415, 4, 5048, 422, 6, 2381, 1102, 6708, 254, 16, 17, 1102, 652, 32, 5134, 4, 3, 11107, 84, 1353, 539, 2460, 2916, 2, 9364, 6, 15192, 652, 15, 1905, 791, 633, 4, 3, 31, 1905, 6, 40, 2665, 544, 8846, 4402, 222, 8576, 32, 4061, 3, 824, 656, 1040, 1, 1102, 222, 4, 813, 441, 491, 2381, 3, 1644, 8846, 4402, 14104, 92, 16, 1452, 9, 539, 2460, 2437, 137, 192, 71, 85, 164, 17, 3, 1102, 652, 120, 122, 40, 44763, 4, 3, 463, 1, 8576, 631, 2952, 1905, 2145, 2, 363, 92, 3526, 136, 1236, 192, 16, 1134, 1237, 17, 136, 670, 1, 1578, 68, 40, 298, 14104, 297, 1267, 127, 1235, 2761, 460, 695, 3437, 3437, 33909, 971, 92, 10, 157, 1114, 22, 8, 43506, 178, 3747, 230, 71, 443, 4, 439, 128, 480, 62, 735, 1102, 652, 20, 37672, 1370, 29, 136, 1905, 26610, 633, 467, 1102, 891, 211, 314, 460, 2, 211, 1268, 22, 8, 189, 283, 4, 813, 441, 32, 446]",2076.0,17604501,137
Synergistic interactions between vorinostat and sorafenib in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells involve Mcl-1 and p21CIP1 down-regulation.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2007-07-01,"Interactions between the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib (Bay 43-9006) and the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat were examined in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells sensitive and resistant to imatinib mesylate. K562, LAMA 84, and primary CML patient-derived CD34(+) mononuclear cells were exposed to vorinostat followed by sorafenib, after which effects on cell viability and various survival signaling pathways were monitored by flow cytometry, clonogenic assays, and Western blotting. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR was used to monitor gene expression, and the functional contribution of p21(CIP1) and Mcl-1 down-regulation were determined in cells transfected with corresponding constructs. Pretreatment (24 h) with vorinostat followed by sorafenib optimally induced mitochondrial injury and cell death in Bcr/Abl(+) cells (e.g., K562 and LAMA 84). Similar results were obtained in imatinib mesylate-resistant cells expressing activated Lyn as well as in primary CD34(+) bone marrow cells obtained from CML patients. This regimen also markedly inhibited CML cell colony formation. Combined but not individual treatment of CML cells with vorinostat and sorafenib triggered pronounced mitochondrial dysfunction (i.e., cytochrome c, Smac, and AIF release), caspase activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and down-regulation of Mcl-1. Sorafenib also blocked vorinostat-mediated induction of p21(CIP1). Down-regulation of Mcl-1 was caspase and transcription independent, whereas p21(CIP1) down-regulation was partially caspase and transcription dependent. Enforced expression of p21(CIP1) and particularly Mcl-1 significantly attenuated vorinostat/sorafenib-mediated lethality. These findings suggest that combined treatment with vorinostat and sorafenib synergistically induces apoptosis in CML cells through a process that involves Mcl-1 down-regulation and inhibition of p21(CIP1) induction.",Journal Article,4587.0,59.0,Interactions between the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib Bay 43-9006 and the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat were examined in chronic myelogenous CML cells sensitive and resistant to imatinib mesylate K562 LAMA 84 and primary CML patient-derived CD34 mononuclear cells were exposed to vorinostat followed by sorafenib after which effects on cell viability and various survival signaling pathways were monitored by flow cytometry clonogenic assays and Western blotting Real-time reverse transcription-PCR was used to monitor gene expression and the functional contribution of p21 CIP1 and Mcl-1 down-regulation were determined in cells transfected with corresponding constructs Pretreatment 24 h with vorinostat followed by sorafenib optimally induced mitochondrial injury and cell death in Bcr/Abl cells e.g. K562 and LAMA 84 Similar results were obtained in imatinib mesylate-resistant cells expressing activated Lyn as well as in primary CD34 marrow cells obtained from CML patients This regimen also markedly inhibited CML cell colony formation Combined but not individual treatment of CML cells with vorinostat and sorafenib triggered pronounced mitochondrial dysfunction i.e. cytochrome c Smac and AIF release caspase activation poly ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage and down-regulation of Mcl-1 Sorafenib also blocked vorinostat-mediated induction of p21 CIP1 Down-regulation of Mcl-1 was caspase and transcription independent whereas p21 CIP1 down-regulation was partially caspase and transcription dependent Enforced expression of p21 CIP1 and particularly Mcl-1 significantly attenuated vorinostat/sorafenib-mediated lethality These findings suggest that combined treatment with vorinostat and sorafenib synergistically induces apoptosis in CML cells through a process that involves Mcl-1 down-regulation and inhibition of p21 CIP1 induction,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1286, 59, 3, 6524, 230, 1034, 7444, 601, 12387, 2, 3, 1508, 2732, 230, 2371, 11, 409, 4, 442, 2194, 903, 37, 745, 2, 436, 6, 577, 2347, 5208, 21071, 874, 2, 86, 903, 69, 526, 2215, 3041, 37, 11, 2234, 6, 2371, 370, 20, 1034, 50, 92, 176, 23, 31, 2120, 2, 747, 25, 314, 460, 11, 2909, 20, 1412, 1914, 3798, 1013, 2, 1521, 3661, 1589, 98, 1772, 866, 604, 10, 95, 6, 3334, 145, 55, 2, 3, 583, 2925, 1, 2657, 6927, 2, 1308, 14, 1328, 863, 11, 509, 4, 37, 3245, 5, 1734, 5500, 1194, 259, 555, 5, 2371, 370, 20, 1034, 5074, 277, 2019, 2730, 2, 31, 273, 4, 1062, 1425, 37, 563, 499, 5208, 2, 21071, 874, 288, 99, 11, 683, 4, 577, 2347, 436, 37, 1046, 735, 8309, 22, 149, 22, 4, 86, 2215, 581, 37, 683, 29, 903, 7, 26, 477, 120, 2195, 879, 903, 31, 1975, 1264, 397, 84, 44, 797, 24, 1, 903, 37, 5, 2371, 2, 1034, 4173, 3517, 2019, 1527, 70, 563, 4155, 256, 9251, 2, 10092, 2008, 1469, 363, 2699, 3638, 3507, 1451, 3155, 2, 1328, 863, 1, 1308, 14, 1034, 120, 2582, 2371, 517, 504, 1, 2657, 6927, 1328, 863, 1, 1308, 14, 10, 1469, 2, 866, 306, 547, 2657, 6927, 1328, 863, 10, 2995, 1469, 2, 866, 470, 7807, 55, 1, 2657, 6927, 2, 823, 1308, 14, 97, 2656, 2371, 1034, 517, 3266, 46, 272, 309, 17, 397, 24, 5, 2371, 2, 1034, 4240, 1516, 351, 4, 903, 37, 298, 8, 1129, 17, 2921, 1308, 14, 1328, 863, 2, 297, 1, 2657, 6927, 504]",1857.0,17634558,121
Sequential ABL kinase inhibitor therapy selects for compound drug-resistant BCR-ABL mutations with altered oncogenic potency.,The Journal of clinical investigation,J. Clin. Invest.,2007-09-01,"Molecularly targeted kinase inhibitor cancer therapies are currently administered sequentially rather than simultaneously. We addressed the potential long-term impact of this strategy in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), which is driven by the fusion oncogene BCR-ABL. Analysis of BCR-ABL genotypes in CML patients who relapsed after sequential treatment with the ABL inhibitors imatinib and dasatinib revealed evolving resistant BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations in all cases. Twelve patients relapsed with the pan-resistant T315I mutation, whereas 6 patients developed novel BCR-ABL mutations predicted to retain sensitivity to imatinib based on in vitro studies. Three of these patients were retreated with imatinib (or the chemically related compound nilotinib) and responded; however, selection for compound mutants (2 or 3 BCR-ABL mutations in the same molecule) can substantially limit the potential effectiveness of retreating patients with inhibitors that have previously failed.

"Childhood central nervous system leukemia: historical perspectives, current therapy, and acute neurological sequelae.",Neuroradiology,Neuroradiology,2007-10-09,"During the past three decades, improvements in the treatment of childhood leukemia have resulted in high cure rates, particularly for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Unfortunately, successful therapy has come with a price, as significant morbidity can result from neurological affects which harm the brain and spinal cord. The expectation and hope is that chemotherapy, as a primary means of CNS therapy, will result in acceptable disease control with less CNS morbidity than has been observed with combinations of chemotherapy and radiotherapy over the past several decades. In this review we discuss the poignant, historical aspects of CNS leukemia therapy, outline current methods of systemic and CNS leukemia therapy, and present imaging findings we have encountered in childhood leukemia patients with a variety of acute neurological conditions. A major objective of our research is to understand the neuroimaging correlates of acute and chronic effects of cancer and therapy. Specific features related to CNS leukemia and associated short-term toxicities, both disease- and therapy-related, are emphasized in this review with the specific neuroimaging findings. Specific CNS findings are similarly important when treating acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and details of leukemic involvement and toxicities are also presented in this entity. Despite contemporary treatment approaches which favor the use of chemotherapy (including intrathecal therapy) over radiotherapy in the treatment of CNS leukemia, children still occasionally experience morbid neurotoxicity. Standard neuroimaging is sufficient to identify a variety of neurotoxic sequelae in children, and often suggest specific etiologies. Specific neuroimaging findings frequently indicate a need to alter antileukemia therapy. It is important to appreciate that intrathecal and high doses of systemic chemotherapy are not innocuous and are associated with acute, specific, recognizable, and often serious neurological consequences.",Journal Article,4487.0,38.0,During the past three decades improvements in the treatment of childhood have resulted in high cure rates particularly for acute lymphoblastic ALL Unfortunately successful therapy has come with a price as significant morbidity can result from neurological affects which harm the brain and spinal cord The expectation and hope is that chemotherapy as a primary means of CNS therapy will result in acceptable disease control with less CNS morbidity than has been observed with combinations of chemotherapy and radiotherapy over the past several decades In this review we discuss the poignant historical aspects of CNS therapy outline current methods of systemic and CNS therapy and present imaging findings we have encountered in childhood patients with a variety of acute neurological conditions A major objective of our research is to understand the neuroimaging correlates of acute and chronic effects of cancer and therapy Specific features related to CNS and associated short-term toxicities both disease- and therapy-related are emphasized in this review with the specific neuroimaging findings Specific CNS findings are similarly important when treating acute myelogenous AML and details of leukemic involvement and toxicities are also presented in this entity Despite contemporary treatment approaches which favor the use of chemotherapy including intrathecal therapy over radiotherapy in the treatment of CNS children still occasionally experience morbid neurotoxicity Standard neuroimaging is sufficient to identify a variety of neurotoxic sequelae in children and often suggest specific etiologies Specific neuroimaging findings frequently indicate a need to alter antileukemia therapy It is important to appreciate that intrathecal and high doses of systemic chemotherapy are not innocuous and are associated with acute specific recognizable and often serious neurological consequences,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[190, 3, 1219, 169, 1968, 1474, 4, 3, 24, 1, 864, 47, 627, 4, 64, 1722, 151, 823, 9, 286, 1275, 62, 3869, 1401, 36, 71, 6235, 5, 8, 8816, 22, 93, 787, 122, 757, 29, 3622, 2561, 92, 7158, 3, 342, 2, 1499, 1885, 3, 9988, 2, 3045, 16, 17, 56, 22, 8, 86, 2263, 1, 1025, 36, 303, 757, 4, 1595, 34, 182, 5, 299, 1025, 787, 76, 71, 85, 164, 5, 1247, 1, 56, 2, 310, 252, 3, 1219, 392, 1968, 4, 26, 206, 21, 1139, 3, 56604, 2252, 2695, 1, 1025, 36, 5277, 291, 636, 1, 403, 2, 1025, 36, 2, 364, 270, 272, 21, 47, 3903, 4, 864, 7, 5, 8, 1362, 1, 286, 3622, 1298, 8, 458, 461, 1, 114, 389, 16, 6, 1640, 3, 7468, 1871, 1, 286, 2, 442, 176, 1, 12, 2, 36, 112, 404, 139, 6, 1025, 2, 41, 978, 337, 385, 110, 34, 2, 36, 139, 32, 8585, 4, 26, 206, 5, 3, 112, 7468, 272, 112, 1025, 272, 32, 1813, 305, 198, 1367, 286, 2194, 329, 2, 3791, 1, 2015, 799, 2, 385, 32, 120, 917, 4, 26, 2983, 550, 2667, 24, 611, 92, 4283, 3, 119, 1, 56, 141, 5126, 36, 252, 310, 4, 3, 24, 1, 1025, 541, 1234, 6319, 730, 8188, 3561, 260, 7468, 16, 1952, 6, 255, 8, 1362, 1, 11148, 4156, 4, 541, 2, 629, 309, 112, 8523, 112, 7468, 272, 746, 1008, 8, 594, 6, 2688, 9169, 36, 192, 16, 305, 6, 19754, 17, 5126, 2, 64, 415, 1, 403, 56, 32, 44, 33576, 2, 32, 41, 5, 286, 112, 13908, 2, 629, 1762, 3622, 3255]",1895.0,17924103,200

CXCR4 up-regulation by imatinib induces chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell migration to bone marrow stroma and promotes survival of quiescent CML cells.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2008-01-01,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is driven by constitutively activated Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, which causes the defective adhesion of CML cells to bone marrow stroma. The overexpression of p210Bcr-Abl was reported to down-regulate CXCR4 expression, and this is associated with the cell migration defects in CML. We proposed that tyrosine kinase inhibitors, imatinib or INNO-406, may restore CXCR4 expression and cause the migration of CML cells to bone marrow microenvironment niches, which in turn results in acquisition of stroma-mediated chemoresistance of CML progenitor cells. In KBM5 and K562 cells, imatinib, INNO-406, or IFN-alpha increased CXCR4 expression and migration. This increase in CXCR4 levels on CML progenitor cells was likewise found in samples from CML patients treated with imatinib or IFN-alpha. Imatinib induced G0-G1 cell cycle block in CML cells, which was further enhanced in a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) coculture system. MSC coculture protected KBM-5 cells from imatinib-induced cell death. These antiapoptotic effects were abrogated by the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3465 or by inhibitor of integrin-linked kinase QLT0267. Altogether, these findings suggest that the up-regulation of CXCR4 by imatinib promotes migration of CML cells to bone marrow stroma, causing the G0-G1 cell cycle arrest and hence ensuring the survival of quiescent CML progenitor cells.",Journal Article,4403.0,134.0,Chronic myelogenous CML is driven by constitutively activated Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase which causes the defective adhesion of CML cells to marrow stroma The overexpression of p210Bcr-Abl was reported to down-regulate CXCR4 expression and this is associated with the cell migration defects in CML We proposed that tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib or INNO-406 may restore CXCR4 expression and cause the migration of CML cells to marrow microenvironment niches which in turn results in acquisition of stroma-mediated chemoresistance of CML progenitor cells In KBM5 and K562 cells imatinib INNO-406 or IFN-alpha increased CXCR4 expression and migration This increase in CXCR4 levels on CML progenitor cells was likewise found in samples from CML patients treated with imatinib or IFN-alpha Imatinib induced G0-G1 cell cycle block in CML cells which was further enhanced in a mesenchymal stem cell MSC coculture system MSC coculture protected KBM-5 cells from imatinib-induced cell death These antiapoptotic effects were abrogated by the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3465 or by inhibitor of integrin-linked kinase QLT0267 Altogether these findings suggest that the up-regulation of CXCR4 by imatinib promotes migration of CML cells to marrow stroma causing the G0-G1 cell cycle arrest and hence ensuring the survival of quiescent CML progenitor cells,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[442, 2194, 903, 16, 1621, 20, 2818, 735, 1062, 1425, 564, 216, 92, 1626, 3, 4552, 2128, 1, 903, 37, 6, 581, 2477, 3, 851, 1, 37526, 1425, 10, 210, 6, 1328, 2288, 2318, 55, 2, 26, 16, 41, 5, 3, 31, 1381, 2945, 4, 903, 21, 1587, 17, 564, 216, 222, 577, 15, 23580, 8522, 68, 6075, 2318, 55, 2, 708, 3, 1381, 1, 903, 37, 6, 581, 995, 8005, 92, 4, 3854, 99, 4, 3405, 1, 2477, 517, 3782, 1, 903, 2520, 37, 4, 10822, 2, 5208, 37, 577, 23580, 8522, 15, 1256, 950, 101, 2318, 55, 2, 1381, 26, 344, 4, 2318, 148, 23, 903, 2520, 37, 10, 6269, 204, 4, 347, 29, 903, 7, 73, 5, 577, 15, 1256, 950, 577, 277, 8588, 3344, 31, 417, 2381, 4, 903, 37, 92, 10, 195, 651, 4, 8, 1569, 452, 31, 4150, 7604, 398, 4150, 7604, 5541, 44409, 33, 37, 29, 577, 277, 31, 273, 46, 4176, 176, 11, 3728, 20, 3, 2318, 3137, 20532, 15, 20, 230, 1, 2876, 1199, 216, 16836, 6767, 46, 272, 309, 17, 3, 126, 863, 1, 2318, 20, 577, 2148, 1381, 1, 903, 37, 6, 581, 2477, 3440, 3, 8588, 3344, 31, 417, 1854, 2, 3665, 8397, 3, 25, 1, 6735, 903, 2520, 37]",1338.0,18202009,198

Reduced-intensity allogeneic transplant in patients older than 55 years: unrelated umbilical cord blood is safe and effective for patients without a matched related donor.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2008-03-01,"The lower morbidity and mortality of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens have allowed allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in older patients. Unrelated umbilical cord blood (UCB) has been investigated as an alternative stem cell source to suitably HLA matched related (MRD) and adult volunteer unrelated donors. We hypothesized that RIC HCT using UCB would be safe and efficacious in older patients, and compared the treatment-related mortality (TRM) and overall survival (OS) of RIC HCT in patients older than 55 years using either MRD (n = 47) or, in patients with no 5 of 6 or 6 of 6 HLA compatible related donors, UCB (n = 43). RIC regimen consisted of total-body irradiation (TBI; 200 cGy) and either cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (n = 69), or busulfan and fludarabine (n = 16) or busulfan and cladribine (n = 5). The median age of MRD and UCB cohorts was 58 (range, 55-70) and 59 (range, 55-69) years, respectively. acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) (50%) was the most common diagnosis. All MRD grafts were 6 of 6 HLA matched to the recipient. Among patients undergoing UCB HCT, 88% received 2 UCB units to optimize cell dose and 93% received 1-2 HLA mismatched grafts. The median follow-up for survivors was 27 (range: 12-61) months. The 3-year probabilities of progression-free survival (PFS; 30% versus 34%, P = .98) and OS (43% versus 34%, P = .57) were similar for recipients of MRD and UCB. The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host (aGVHD) disease (42% versus 49%, P = .20) and TRM at 180-days (23% versus 28%, P = .36) were comparable. However, UCB recipients had a lower incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) at 1 year (40% versus 17%, P = .02). On multivariate analysis, graft type had no impact on TRM or survival, and the HCT comorbidity index score was the only factor independently predictive for these endpoints.

Altered gene expression in busulfan-resistant human myeloid leukemia.,Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2008-03-12,"Busulfan (Bu) resistance is a major obstacle to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) of patients with chronic or acute myelogenous leukemia (CML or AML). We used gene expression analysis to identify cellular factors underlying Bu resistance. Two Bu-resistant leukemia cell lines were established, characterized and analyzed for differentially expressed genes. The CML B5/Bu250(6) cells are 4.5-fold more resistant to Bu than their parental B5 cells. The AML KBM3/Bu250(6) cells are 4.0-fold more Bu-resistant than KBM3 parental cells. Both resistant sublines evade Bu-mediated G2-arrest and apoptosis with altered regulations of CHK2 and CDC2 proteins, constitutively up-regulated anti-apoptotic genes (BCL-X(L), BCL2, BCL2L10, BAG3 and IAP2/BIRC3) and down-regulated pro-apoptotic genes (BIK, BNIP3, and LTBR). Bu-induced apoptosis is partly mediated by activation of caspases; use of the inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK completely abrogated PARP1 cleavage and reduced apoptosis by approximately 50%. Furthermore, Bu resistance in these cells may be attributed in part to up-regulation of HSP90 protein and activation of STAT3. The inhibition of HSP90 with geldanamycin attenuated phosphorylated STAT3 and made B5/Bu250(6) and KBM3/Bu250(6) more Bu-sensitive. The analysis of cells derived from patients classified as either clinically resistant or sensitive to high-dose Bu-based chemotherapy indicated alterations in gene expression that were analogous to those observed in the in vitro model cell lines, confirming the potential clinical relevance of this model for Bu resistance.",Journal Article,4332.0,40.0,Busulfan Bu resistance is a major obstacle to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation HSCT of patients with chronic or acute myelogenous CML or AML We used gene expression analysis to identify cellular factors underlying Bu resistance Two Bu-resistant cell lines were established characterized and analyzed for differentially expressed genes The CML B5/Bu250 6 cells are 4.5-fold more resistant to Bu than their parental B5 cells The AML KBM3/Bu250 6 cells are 4.0-fold more Bu-resistant than KBM3 parental cells Both resistant sublines evade Bu-mediated G2-arrest and apoptosis with altered regulations of CHK2 and CDC2 proteins constitutively up-regulated anti-apoptotic genes BCL-X L BCL2 BCL2L10 BAG3 and IAP2/BIRC3 and down-regulated pro-apoptotic genes BIK BNIP3 and LTBR Bu-induced apoptosis is partly mediated by activation of caspases use of the inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK completely abrogated PARP1 cleavage and reduced apoptosis by approximately 50 Furthermore Bu resistance in these cells may be attributed in part to up-regulation of HSP90 protein and activation of STAT3 The inhibition of HSP90 with geldanamycin attenuated phosphorylated STAT3 and made B5/Bu250 6 and KBM3/Bu250 6 more Bu-sensitive The analysis of cells derived from patients classified as either clinically resistant or sensitive to high-dose Bu-based chemotherapy indicated alterations in gene expression that were analogous to those observed in the in vitro model cell lines confirming the potential clinical relevance of this model for Bu resistance,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3906, 3667, 251, 16, 8, 458, 7414, 6, 1007, 452, 31, 497, 1703, 1, 7, 5, 442, 15, 286, 2194, 903, 15, 329, 21, 95, 145, 55, 65, 6, 255, 763, 130, 1181, 3667, 251, 100, 3667, 436, 31, 285, 11, 635, 765, 2, 311, 9, 2478, 570, 214, 3, 903, 28617, 21503, 49, 37, 32, 39, 33, 1116, 80, 436, 6, 3667, 76, 136, 3418, 28617, 37, 3, 329, 25070, 21503, 49, 37, 32, 39, 13, 1116, 80, 3667, 436, 76, 25070, 3418, 37, 110, 436, 12538, 6636, 3667, 517, 3774, 1854, 2, 351, 5, 1495, 13608, 1, 14253, 2, 8747, 652, 2818, 126, 1065, 312, 1631, 214, 1044, 1006, 805, 3214, 56929, 56930, 2, 34058, 31246, 2, 1328, 1065, 1805, 1631, 214, 17319, 38668, 2, 44815, 3667, 277, 351, 16, 5180, 517, 20, 363, 1, 7629, 119, 1, 3, 230, 3905, 10167, 10281, 2500, 3728, 6033, 3155, 2, 405, 351, 20, 705, 212, 798, 3667, 251, 4, 46, 37, 68, 40, 3073, 4, 760, 6, 126, 863, 1, 2515, 178, 2, 363, 1, 1439, 3, 297, 1, 2515, 5, 10260, 2656, 2365, 1439, 2, 1229, 28617, 21503, 49, 2, 25070, 21503, 49, 80, 3667, 745, 3, 65, 1, 37, 526, 29, 7, 1373, 22, 361, 505, 436, 15, 745, 6, 64, 61, 3667, 90, 56, 1103, 593, 4, 145, 55, 17, 11, 8579, 6, 135, 164, 4, 3, 4, 439, 202, 31, 285, 5030, 3, 174, 38, 2088, 1, 26, 202, 9, 3667, 251]",1528.0,18339423,86
Optimizing outcomes for patients with advanced disease in chronic myelogenous leukemia.,Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2008-02-01,"The treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) has been revolutionized by the development of the small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib. The primary target for this drug is the oncogenic BCR-ABL kinase. Five-year survival rates for patients in chronic phase CML is now greater than 80%. Patients who have advanced beyond the chronic phase to the accelerated phase or blast crisis, however, have not faired as well. Progression occurs for a variety of reasons, including late diagnosis, slow response to imatinib, and the development of imatinib-resistant clones. Imatinib resistance has, in part, been addressed with the introduction of the new BCR-ABL inhibitors, namely dasatinib and nilotinib. These drugs have shown efficacy in CML patients with wild-type BCR-ABL and some BCR-ABL mutants that are imatinib-resistant. Unfortunately, some BCR-ABL mutations remain resistant to these therapies and will require the development of alternative treatments, and other mechanisms of imatinib resistance besides BCR-ABL mutation exist. In the future, genetic and pharmacologic tests may allow the clinician to predict response to imatinib. More aggressive therapies are being considered for high-risk patients, including increased dosage of the current tyrosine kinase inhibitors, along with combination therapies. Aggressive therapy holds promise, as the data suggest that responses are improved. Unfortunately, toxicities are also increased, and thus a balance must be found to ensure safety and compliance. This is especially important for young CML patients, who hopefully will remain in remission for decades. Polymerase chain reaction analysis has become of primary importance as a means of assessing disease burden, and given the idiosyncrasies of this technique, standards must be established to allow results to be compared across different institutions. Additionally, the nature of advanced disease is being explored. Intriguingly, genetic analysis of transformed blasts from patients in blast crisis has identified numerous members of the Wnt/B-catenin pathway and JunB as being activated. Increased activity of these pathways correlates with poor response and eventual disease progression. In addition to these data, evidence is emerging associating survival of the quiescent blast cell with Wnt activity, leading to the hope that Wnt inhibitors will increase the likelihood of eradicating these cells. Other areas such as microRNA profiling and DNA methylation patterns are likely to provide important information.",Journal Article,4372.0,27.0,The treatment of chronic myelogenous CML has been revolutionized by the development of the small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib The primary target for this drug is the oncogenic BCR-ABL kinase Five-year survival rates for patients in chronic phase CML is now greater than 80 Patients who have advanced beyond the chronic phase to the accelerated phase or blast crisis however have not faired as well Progression occurs for a variety of reasons including late diagnosis slow response to imatinib and the development of imatinib-resistant clones Imatinib resistance has in part been addressed with the introduction of the new BCR-ABL inhibitors namely dasatinib and nilotinib These drugs have shown efficacy in CML patients with wild-type BCR-ABL and some BCR-ABL mutants that are imatinib-resistant Unfortunately some BCR-ABL mutations remain resistant to these therapies and will require the development of alternative treatments and other mechanisms of imatinib resistance besides BCR-ABL mutation exist In the future genetic and pharmacologic tests may allow the clinician to predict response to imatinib More aggressive therapies are being considered for high-risk patients including increased dosage of the current tyrosine kinase inhibitors along with combination therapies Aggressive therapy holds promise as the data suggest that responses are improved Unfortunately toxicities are also increased and thus a balance must be found to ensure safety and compliance This is especially important for young CML patients who hopefully will remain in remission for decades Polymerase chain reaction analysis has become of primary importance as a means of assessing disease burden and given the idiosyncrasies of this technique standards must be established to allow results to be compared across different institutions Additionally the nature of advanced disease is being explored Intriguingly genetic analysis of transformed blasts from patients in blast crisis has identified numerous members of the Wnt/B-catenin pathway and JunB as being activated Increased activity of these pathways correlates with poor response and eventual disease progression In addition to these data evidence is emerging associating survival of the quiescent blast cell with Wnt activity leading to the hope that Wnt inhibitors will increase the likelihood of eradicating these cells Other areas such as microRNA profiling and DNA methylation patterns are likely to provide important information,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 24, 1, 442, 2194, 903, 71, 85, 5746, 20, 3, 193, 1, 3, 302, 1354, 564, 216, 230, 577, 3, 86, 283, 9, 26, 234, 16, 3, 1302, 1062, 1425, 216, 365, 111, 25, 151, 9, 7, 4, 442, 124, 903, 16, 1134, 378, 76, 493, 7, 54, 47, 131, 1654, 3, 442, 124, 6, 3, 2241, 124, 15, 3112, 6540, 137, 47, 44, 33195, 22, 149, 91, 1780, 9, 8, 1362, 1, 2325, 141, 807, 147, 3645, 51, 6, 577, 2, 3, 193, 1, 577, 436, 2749, 577, 251, 71, 4, 760, 85, 2814, 5, 3, 2456, 1, 3, 217, 1062, 1425, 222, 5046, 1674, 2, 2638, 46, 600, 47, 443, 209, 4, 903, 7, 5, 955, 267, 1062, 1425, 2, 476, 1062, 1425, 3423, 17, 32, 577, 436, 3869, 476, 1062, 1425, 138, 918, 436, 6, 46, 235, 2, 303, 1353, 3, 193, 1, 1091, 640, 2, 127, 483, 1, 577, 251, 7301, 1062, 1425, 258, 1923, 4, 3, 508, 336, 2, 2788, 895, 68, 1700, 3, 3744, 6, 678, 51, 6, 577, 80, 571, 235, 32, 486, 515, 9, 64, 43, 7, 141, 101, 3323, 1, 3, 291, 564, 216, 222, 1510, 5, 150, 235, 571, 36, 5253, 1783, 22, 3, 74, 309, 17, 253, 32, 231, 3869, 385, 32, 120, 101, 2, 631, 8, 3459, 1642, 40, 204, 6, 3478, 367, 2, 3336, 26, 16, 1093, 305, 9, 1169, 903, 7, 54, 7464, 303, 918, 4, 734, 9, 1968, 1451, 1260, 1329, 65, 71, 1417, 1, 86, 1187, 22, 8, 2263, 1, 1977, 34, 892, 2, 447, 3, 56937, 1, 26, 1312, 3371, 1642, 40, 635, 6, 1700, 99, 6, 40, 72, 716, 338, 1764, 1724, 3, 2202, 1, 131, 34, 16, 486, 1443, 11550, 336, 65, 1, 2423, 2438, 29, 7, 4, 3112, 6540, 71, 108, 2331, 1684, 1, 3, 2112, 132, 1778, 308, 2, 12868, 22, 486, 735, 101, 128, 1, 46, 460, 1871, 5, 334, 51, 2, 6956, 34, 91, 4, 352, 6, 46, 74, 241, 16, 1478, 12373, 25, 1, 3, 6735, 3112, 31, 5, 2112, 128, 1049, 6, 3, 3045, 17, 2112, 222, 303, 344, 3, 1420, 1, 11001, 46, 37, 127, 1361, 225, 22, 3213, 1080, 2, 261, 569, 764, 32, 322, 6, 377, 305, 487]",2485.0,18346528,66

Cancer Res.,2008-05-01,"Deforolimus (AP23573), a novel non-prodrug rapamycin analogue, inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin, a downstream effector of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and nutrient-sensing pathways. A phase 2 trial was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of single-agent deforolimus in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies. Eligible patients were assigned to one of five disease-specific, parallel cohorts and given 12.5 mg deforolimus as a 30-minute infusion once daily for 5 days every 2 weeks. A Simon two-stage design was used for each cohort. Safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor response were assessed. Fifty-five patients received deforolimus as follows: cohort 1 23 acute myelogenous leukemia, two myelodysplastic syndrome and one chronic myelogenous leukemia in nonlymphoid blast phase; cohort 2, one acute lymphocytic leukemia; cohort 3, nine agnogenic myeloid metaplasia; cohort 4, eight chronic lymphocytic leukemia; cohort 5, nine mantle cell lymphoma and two T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Most patients were heavily pretreated. Of the 52 evaluable patients, partial responses were noted in five (10%), two of seven agnogenic myeloid metaplasia and three of nine mantle cell lymphoma. Hematologic improvement/stable disease was observed in 21 (40%). Common treatment-related adverse events, which were generally mild and reversible, were mouth sores, fatigue, nausea, and thrombocytopenia.

Vorinostat synergistically potentiates MK-0457 lethality in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells sensitive and resistant to imatinib mesylate.,Blood,Blood,2008-05-27,"Interactions between the dual Bcr/Abl and aurora kinase inhibitor MK-0457 and the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat were examined in Bcr/Abl(+) leukemia cells, including those resistant to imatinib mesylate (IM), particularly those with the T315I mutation. Coadministration of vorinostat dramatically increased MK-0457 lethality in K562 and LAMA84 cells. Notably, the MK-0457/vorinostat regimen was highly active against primary CD34(+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells and Ba/F3 cells bearing various Bcr/Abl mutations (ie, T315I, E255K, and M351T), as well as IM-resistant K562 cells exhibiting Bcr/Abl-independent, Lyn-dependent resistance. These events were associated with inactivation and down-regulation of wild-type (wt) and mutated Bcr/Abl (particularly T315I). Moreover, treatment with MK-0457 resulted in accumulation of cells with 4N or more DNA content, whereas coadministration of vorinostat markedly enhanced aurora kinase inhibition by MK-0457, and preferentially killed polyploid cells. Furthermore, vorinostat also interacted with a selective inhibitor of aurora kinase A and B to potentiate apoptosis without modifying Bcr/Abl activity. Finally, vorinostat markedly induced Bim expression, while blockade of Bim induction by siRNA dramatically diminished the capacity of this agent to potentiate MK-0457 lethality. Together, these findings indicate that vorinostat strikingly increases MK-0457 activity against IM-sensitive and -resistant CML cells through inactivation of Bcr/Abl and aurora kinases, as well as by induction of Bim.",Journal Article,4256.0,44.0,Interactions between the dual Bcr/Abl and aurora kinase inhibitor MK-0457 and the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat were examined in Bcr/Abl cells including those resistant to imatinib mesylate IM particularly those with the T315I mutation Coadministration of vorinostat dramatically increased MK-0457 lethality in K562 and LAMA84 cells Notably the MK-0457/vorinostat regimen was highly active against primary CD34 chronic myelogenous CML cells and Ba/F3 cells bearing various Bcr/Abl mutations ie T315I E255K and M351T as well as IM-resistant K562 cells exhibiting Bcr/Abl-independent Lyn-dependent resistance These events were associated with inactivation and down-regulation of wild-type wt and mutated Bcr/Abl particularly T315I Moreover treatment with MK-0457 resulted in accumulation of cells with 4N or more DNA content whereas coadministration of vorinostat markedly enhanced aurora kinase inhibition by MK-0457 and preferentially killed polyploid cells Furthermore vorinostat also interacted with a selective inhibitor of aurora kinase A and B to potentiate apoptosis without modifying Bcr/Abl activity Finally vorinostat markedly induced Bim expression while blockade of Bim induction by siRNA dramatically diminished the capacity of this agent to potentiate MK-0457 lethality Together these findings indicate that vorinostat strikingly increases MK-0457 activity against IM-sensitive and -resistant CML cells through inactivation of Bcr/Abl and aurora kinases as well as by induction of Bim,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1286, 59, 3, 1828, 1062, 1425, 2, 4095, 216, 230, 3558, 14996, 2, 3, 1508, 2732, 230, 2371, 11, 409, 4, 1062, 1425, 37, 141, 135, 436, 6, 577, 2347, 2820, 823, 135, 5, 3, 6184, 258, 5777, 1, 2371, 2729, 101, 3558, 14996, 3266, 4, 5208, 2, 33628, 37, 2552, 3, 3558, 14996, 2371, 477, 10, 561, 544, 480, 86, 2215, 442, 2194, 903, 37, 2, 6669, 6904, 37, 1894, 747, 1062, 1425, 138, 2523, 6184, 16677, 2, 30931, 22, 149, 22, 2820, 436, 5208, 37, 4801, 1062, 1425, 306, 8309, 470, 251, 46, 281, 11, 41, 5, 2297, 2, 1328, 863, 1, 955, 267, 1820, 2, 1185, 1062, 1425, 823, 6184, 1393, 24, 5, 3558, 14996, 627, 4, 1835, 1, 37, 5, 22181, 15, 80, 261, 2457, 547, 5777, 1, 2371, 2195, 651, 4095, 216, 297, 20, 3558, 14996, 2, 3509, 8239, 28574, 37, 798, 2371, 120, 7940, 5, 8, 1094, 230, 1, 4095, 216, 8, 2, 132, 6, 6428, 351, 187, 4898, 1062, 1425, 128, 1368, 2371, 2195, 277, 3595, 55, 369, 1189, 1, 3595, 504, 20, 1919, 2729, 2849, 3, 2162, 1, 26, 420, 6, 6428, 3558, 14996, 3266, 1162, 46, 272, 1008, 17, 2371, 6787, 1106, 3558, 14996, 128, 480, 2820, 745, 2, 436, 903, 37, 298, 2297, 1, 1062, 1425, 2, 4095, 1549, 22, 149, 22, 20, 504, 1, 3595]",1508.0,18505786,15
Intermittent target inhibition with dasatinib 100 mg once daily preserves efficacy and improves tolerability in imatinib-resistant and -intolerant chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2008-06-09,"Dasatinib is a BCR-ABL inhibitor, 325-fold more potent than imatinib against unmutated BCR-ABL in vitro. Phase II studies have demonstrated efficacy and safety with dasatinib 70 mg twice daily in chronic-phase (CP) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) after imatinib treatment failure. In phase I, responses occurred with once-daily administration despite only intermittent BCR-ABL inhibition. Once-daily treatment resulted in less toxicity, suggesting that toxicity results from continuous inhibition of unintended targets. Here, a dose- and schedule-optimization study is reported. In this open-label phase III trial, 670 patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CP-CML were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 between four dasatinib treatment groups: 100 mg once daily, 50 mg twice daily, 140 mg once daily, or 70 mg twice daily. With minimum follow-up of 6 months (median treatment duration, 8 months; range, < 1 to 15 months), marked and comparable hematologic (complete, 86% to 92%) and cytogenetic (major, 54% to 59%; complete, 41% to 45%) response rates were observed across the four groups. Time to and duration of cytogenetic response were similar, as was progression-free survival (8% to 11% of patients experienced disease progression or died). Compared with the approved 70-mg twice-daily regimen, dasatinib 100 mg once daily resulted in significantly lower rates of pleural effusion (all grades, 7% v 16%; P = .024) and grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia (22% v 37%; P = .004), and fewer patients required dose interruption (51% v 68%), reduction (30% v 55%), or discontinuation (16% v 23%). Dasatinib 100 mg once daily retains the efficacy of 70 mg twice daily with less toxicity. Intermittent target inhibition with tyrosine kinase inhibitors may preserve efficacy and reduce adverse events.","Clinical Trial, Phase III",4243.0,392.0,Dasatinib is a BCR-ABL inhibitor 325-fold more potent than imatinib against unmutated BCR-ABL in vitro Phase II studies have demonstrated efficacy and safety with dasatinib 70 mg twice daily in chronic-phase CP chronic myelogenous CML after imatinib treatment failure In phase I responses occurred with once-daily administration despite only intermittent BCR-ABL inhibition Once-daily treatment resulted in less toxicity suggesting that toxicity results from continuous inhibition of unintended targets Here a dose- and schedule-optimization study is reported In this open-label phase III trial 670 patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CP-CML were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 between four dasatinib treatment groups 100 mg once daily 50 mg twice daily 140 mg once daily or 70 mg twice daily With minimum follow-up of 6 months median treatment duration 8 months range 1 to 15 months marked and comparable hematologic complete 86 to 92 and cytogenetic major 54 to 59 complete 41 to 45 response rates were observed across the four groups Time to and duration of cytogenetic response were similar as was progression-free survival 8 to 11 of patients experienced disease progression or died Compared with the approved 70-mg twice-daily regimen dasatinib 100 mg once daily resulted in significantly lower rates of pleural effusion all grades 7 v 16 P .024 and grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia 22 v 37 P .004 and fewer patients required dose interruption 51 v 68 reduction 30 v 55 or discontinuation 16 v 23 Dasatinib 100 mg once daily retains the efficacy of 70 mg twice daily with less toxicity Intermittent target inhibition with tyrosine kinase inhibitors may preserve efficacy and reduce adverse events,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1674, 16, 8, 1062, 1425, 230, 7139, 1116, 80, 1157, 76, 577, 480, 7216, 1062, 1425, 4, 439, 124, 215, 94, 47, 264, 209, 2, 367, 5, 1674, 431, 81, 936, 391, 4, 442, 124, 2541, 442, 2194, 903, 50, 577, 24, 496, 4, 124, 70, 253, 489, 5, 1059, 391, 634, 550, 158, 4102, 1062, 1425, 297, 1059, 391, 24, 627, 4, 299, 155, 802, 17, 155, 99, 29, 1314, 297, 1, 18348, 637, 467, 8, 61, 2, 1055, 3980, 45, 16, 210, 4, 26, 1020, 1756, 124, 316, 160, 10335, 7, 5, 577, 436, 15, 4944, 2541, 903, 11, 1108, 896, 14, 14, 14, 14, 59, 294, 1674, 24, 271, 394, 81, 1059, 391, 212, 81, 936, 391, 3304, 81, 1059, 391, 15, 431, 81, 936, 391, 5, 2499, 166, 126, 1, 49, 53, 52, 24, 654, 66, 53, 184, 14, 6, 167, 53, 2003, 2, 1279, 813, 236, 868, 6, 937, 2, 1266, 458, 667, 6, 728, 236, 605, 6, 512, 51, 151, 11, 164, 716, 3, 294, 271, 98, 6, 2, 654, 1, 1266, 51, 11, 288, 22, 10, 91, 115, 25, 66, 6, 175, 1, 7, 592, 34, 91, 15, 1016, 72, 5, 3, 850, 431, 81, 936, 391, 477, 1674, 394, 81, 1059, 391, 627, 4, 97, 280, 151, 1, 2164, 4433, 62, 2276, 67, 603, 245, 19, 4247, 2, 88, 27, 6, 39, 1340, 350, 603, 567, 19, 1520, 2, 1497, 7, 616, 61, 4823, 725, 603, 806, 628, 201, 603, 614, 15, 2007, 245, 603, 382, 1674, 394, 81, 1059, 391, 10785, 3, 209, 1, 431, 81, 936, 391, 5, 299, 155, 4102, 283, 297, 5, 564, 216, 222, 68, 6783, 209, 2, 969, 290, 281]",1706.0,18541900,151
Osteonecrosis in adult survivors of childhood cancer: a report from the childhood cancer survivor study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2008-06-01,"Osteonecrosis (ON) is a potentially serious complication of therapy in survivors of childhood cancer. Our goals were to describe the incidence of ON and identify patient and treatment characteristics associated with elevated risk. The rate of self-reported ON was determined for 9,261 patients enrolled onto the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, a cohort of 5-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed from 1970 to 1986, and compared with the rate in a random sample of 2,872 siblings of survivors. Survivors with positive responses were reinterviewed to confirm the diagnosis. Fifty-two cancer survivors reported ON in 78 joints, yielding 20-year cumulative incidence of 0.43% and a rate ratio (RR) of 6.2 (95% CI, 2.3 to 17.2) compared with siblings, adjusted for age and sex; 44% developed ON in a previous radiation field. The RR was greatest among survivors of stem-cell transplantation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (RR = 26.9, 66.5, and 93.1, respectively). Nontransplantation patients with ALL (RR = 6.5; 95% CI, 2.2 to 19.4), AML (RR = 11.2; 95% CI, 2.1 to 61.2), and bone sarcoma (RR = 7.3; 95% CI, 2.0 to 26.2) were at higher risk for ON. Older age at diagnosis, shorter elapsed time, older treatment era, exposure to dexamethasone (+/- prednisone), and gonadal and nongonadal radiation were independently associated with ON.

Activation of NK cells by extracellular heat shock protein 70 through induction of NKG2D ligands on dendritic cells.,Cancer immunity,Cancer Immun.,2008-07-10,"We have previously reported that heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) vaccination induced natural killer (NK) cell activity in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In this study, HSP70 of both autologous and allogeneic origin was found to stimulate IFN-gamma production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of CML patients, as well as of normal subjects. Further investigations demonstrated that the activity of HSP70 was dependent on both NK cells and dendritic cells (DCs). HSP70 did not induce significant IFN-gamma production from either NK cells or DCs alone. Mechanistically, we found that HSP70-mediated DC-NK cell crosstalk required cell-cell contact, which could be inhibited completely by neutralizing antibody against NK activating receptor NKG2D. The significance of NKG2D was further corroborated by the finding that HSP70 induced the expression of an NKG2D ligand, the MHC class I chain-related protein A (MICA), on DCs; HSP70-augmented IFN-gamma release was abrogated by antibody against MICA.

Inhibition of polysome assembly enhances imatinib activity against chronic myelogenous leukemia and overcomes imatinib resistance.,Molecular and cellular biology,Mol. Cell. Biol.,2008-08-11,"Dysregulated mRNA translation is implicated in the pathogenesis of many human cancers including chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Because our prior work has specifically implicated translation initiation in CML, we tested compounds that could modulate translation initiation and polysomal mRNA assembly. Here, we evaluated the activity of one such compound, CGP57380, against CML cells and explored its mechanisms of action. First, using polysomal mRNA profiles, we found that imatinib and CGP57380 could independently, and cooperatively, impair polysomal mRNA loading. Imatinib and CGP57380 also synergistically inhibited the growth of Ba/F3-Bcr-Abl and K562 cells via impaired cell cycle entry and increased apoptosis. Mechanistically, CGP57380 inhibited efficient polysomal assembly via two processes. First, it enhanced imatinib-mediated inhibition of eukaryotic initiation factor 4F induction, and second, it independently impaired phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 on the preinitiation complex. We also identified multiple substrates of the mTOR, Rsk, and Mnk kinases as targets of CGP57380. Finally, we found a novel negative-feedback loop to the mitogen-activated protein kinase/Mnk pathway that is triggered by CGP57380 and demonstrated that an interruption of the loop further increased the activity of the combination against imatinib-sensitive and -resistant CML cells.

Ceramide promotes apoptosis in chronic myelogenous leukemia-derived K562 cells by a mechanism involving caspase-8 and JNK.,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",Cell Cycle,2008-11-02,"Ceramide is a sphingolipid that activates stress kinases such as p38 and c-JUN N-Terminal Kinase (JNK). Though Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) derived K562 cells resist killing by short chain C2-ceramide, we report here that longer chain C6-ceramide promotes apoptosis in these cells. C6-ceramide induces cleavage of Caspase-8 and Caspase-9, but only Caspase-8 is required for apoptosis. The sphingolipid killed CML derived KBM5 cells and, to a lesser extent, imatinib-resistant KBM5-STI cells suggesting that BCR-ABL can not completely block C6-ceramide-induced apoptosis but the kinase may regulate the process. BCR-ABL is known to suppress Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in CML cells. While C6-ceramide can activate PP2A in acute leukemia cells, the sphingolipid did not activate the phosphatase in K562 cells. C6-ceramide did not activate p38 kinase but did promote JNK activation and phosphorylation of JUN.

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation with alemtuzumab-based conditioning for patients with advanced chronic myelogenous leukemia.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2009-01-01,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the treatment of choice for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who have failed or are intolerant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Myeloablative conditioning regimens have been associated with high treatment-related mortality (TRM) rate in such patients, and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens are often preferred but have high rates of disease recurrence and graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). We report our experience with nine CML patients (four chronic phase and five with accelerated phase or blast crisis) who failed TKI and underwent allo-HSCT using an alemtuzumab-based RIC regimen. The conditioning regimen was well tolerated and induced engraftment in all patients, and complete cytogenetic remission (CCyR) in eight of nine. Four patients, all with a history of accelerated phase or blast crisis, died. Four of the five remaining patients had a cytogenetic relapse a median of 10 months after transplantation. Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), TKI or both induced a CCyR in all cases. With a median follow-up of 47 months, five patients, including all those transplanted in first or second chronic phase, are alive and in remission. Allo-HSCT with an alemtuzumab-based conditioning regimen induces remission in patients with CML that have failed TKI therapy and has a low incidence of GVHD.

Suboptimal response to or failure of imatinib treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia: what is the optimal strategy?,Mayo Clinic proceedings,Mayo Clin. Proc.,2009-02-01,"Treatment responses to imatinib vary among patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and definitions of treatment failure and suboptimal response have been published. This article discusses monitoring and treatment of patients with CML after failure of or suboptimal response to imatinib therapy. We reviewed articles listed on PubMed from January 1, 2002, to July 31, 2008, and abstracts from the 2007 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology. Search terms used were chronic myeloid/myelogenous leukemia, imatinib, and BCR-ABL. To enable early recognition of suboptimal responses, patients should be frequently monitored according to published guidelines, including cytogenetic analysis every 6 months until a complete response is achieved and molecular monitoring every 3 months from the start of therapy or monthly if an increasing BCR-ABL1 transcript level is detected. Mutational analysis of BCR-ABL1 may assist with treatment selection. A recent survey suggests that a notable proportion of physicians do not follow treatment guidelines and that broader communication is required. Recent recommendations state that, in patients whose response to imatinib at 400 mg/d is suboptimal, the dose should be increased, whereas alternative therapies, such as dasatinib, nilotinib, and allogeneic stem cell transplant (in eligible patients), and imatinib dose escalation should be considered after imatinib failure. However, clinical data are lacking to confirm this sequence of treatments, and introducing alternative therapies at an earlier stage of treatment, for example, after a suboptimal response, may produce better long-term outcomes in a higher proportion of patients.

Preclinical studies of vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid) combined with cytosine arabinoside and etoposide for treatment of acute leukemias.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2009-02-17,"Vorinostat [suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA)] is a potent histone deacetylase inhibitor with promising clinical efficacy as an anticancer agent. In this preclinical study, we evaluated combining cytosine arabinoside [1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C)] and/or etoposide with vorinostat for use in the treatment of acute leukemias. Cell survival was examined in vitro in HL-60 human myeloid leukemia cells and K562 myeloid blast crisis chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, using the 2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide inner salt and/or fluorescein diacetate/propidium iodide assays. Drug interactions were analyzed by the combination index method (CalcuSyn) and by a novel statistical method that we developed (SynStat). Cell cycle phase distribution was measured by flow cytometry. Cytotoxic antagonism resulted when vorinostat was combined concomitantly with ara-C; however, when vorinostat was given first followed by a drug-free interval before ara-C treatment, this sequential combination was mostly synergistic. Etoposide combined with vorinostat was additive to synergistic, and the synergism became more pronounced when etoposide was given after vorinostat.

Phase II study of imatinib mesylate for recurrent meningiomas (North American Brain Tumor Consortium study 01-08).,Neuro-oncology,Neuro-oncology,2009-12-01,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and its receptors (PDGFR) are frequently coexpressed in meningiomas, potentially contributing to their pathogenesis. The North American Brain Tumor Consortium conducted a phase II study to evaluate the therapeutic potential of imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), a PDGFR inhibitor, in patients with recurrent meningiomas. Patients were stratified into benign (WHO grade I) meningiomas or atypical (WHO grade II) and malignant (WHO grade III) meningiomas. The primary end point was 6-month progression-free survival (6M-PFS). Patients requiring enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs were ineligible. Patients received imatinib at a dose of 600 mg/day for the first 4-week cycle and then gradually increased to 800 mg/day for subsequent cycles, if there were no unacceptable toxicities. Plasma concentrations of imatinib and its active metabolite, CGP74588, were assessed. Twenty-three heavily pretreated patients were enrolled into the study (13 benign, 5 atypical, and 5 malignant meningiomas), of whom 22 were eligible. The study was closed prematurely due to slow accrual. Tissue was available only from a minority of patients, but in these specimens there was uniform distribution of PDGFR, the drug target. Imatinib was generally well tolerated. Of 19 patients evaluable for response, 10 progressed at the first scan, and 9 were stable. There were no complete or partial responses. Overall median PFS was 2 months (range, 0.7-34 months); 6M-PFS was 29.4%. For benign meningiomas, median PFS was 3 months (range, 1.1-34 months); 6M-PFS was 45%. For atypical and malignant meningiomas, median PFS was 2 months (range, 0.7-3.7 months); 6M-PFS was 0%. Cycle 1 trough concentrations of imatinib and CGP74588 were 2,129 +/- 1,600 ng/ml and 517 +/- 326 ng/ml, respectively. Single-agent imatinib was well tolerated but had no significant activity in recurrent meningiomas.

Downregulation of JUNB mRNA expression in advanced phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.,Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2009-05-05,"JUNB inactivation in transgenic mice results in a myeloproliferative disorder that closely resembles human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). It has been reported that downregulation of JUNB expression is a universal phenomenon in patients with CML due aberrant DNA methylation of its promoter. Based on this, we studied methylation and gene expression levels of JUNB in CML. We analyzed the methylation status of the JUNB gene in 6 cell lines and in 102 patients with CML using several bisulfite PCR assays. JUNB expression was analyzed using real-time PCR and gene expression profiling. JUNB methylation was not observed in any of the cell lines studied, and only in 3% of patients with CML. Despite the lack of JUNB methylation, JUNB was expressed at low levels both in CML cell lines (median dCT -6.86; range -5.87 to -9.61), and in patients with CML in blastic phase (BP) (median dCT -3.95; range -1.48 to -6.29) (p = 0.002). Finally, we evaluated JUNB expression in 82 additional patients with CML by gene expression arrays. We found that JUNB was significantly downregulated in advanced phase CML in contrast to chronic phase CML (median log ratio difference in expression = 0.53).

Changes in DNA methylation of tandem DNA repeats are different from interspersed repeats in cancer.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2009-08-01,"Hypomethylation of DNA repetitive elements is a common finding in cancer, but very little is known about the DNA methylation changes of different types of DNA repetitive elements, such as interspersed repeats (LINE1 and Alu Yb8) and tandem repeats (Sat-alpha, NBL-2 and D4Z4). We used bisulfite-PCR Pyrosequencing to quantitatively measure the DNA methylation of five different DNA repetitive elements in normal tissue and cancer. In all we studied 10 different tissues from four individuals undergoing autopsy, 34 paired normal and tumor tissues from patients with bladder cancer, 58 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and 23 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. We found that the DNA methylation of interspersed repeats (LINE1 and Alu Yb8) was very consistent from person to person and tissue to tissue while tandem DNA repeats appeared more variable in normal tissues. In bladder cancer we found clear hypomethylation of LINE1, Alu Yb8, Sat-alpha and NBL-2. Conversely, we found an increase in the DNA methylation levels of D4Z4 from normal to cancer. In contrast leukemia showed no significant changes in the DNA methylation of LINE1 and Alu Yb8, but DNA methylation increases in NBL-2 and D4Z4 tandem repeats.

Dasatinib in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in accelerated phase after imatinib failure: the START a trial.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-06-01,"PURPOSE Patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in accelerated phase (CML-AP) that is resistant or intolerant to imatinib have limited therapeutic options. Dasatinib, a potent inhibitor of BCR-ABL and SRC-family kinases, has efficacy in patients with CML-AP who have experienced treatment failure with imatinib. We now report follow-up data from the full patient cohort of 174 patients enrolled onto a phase II trial to provide a more complete assessment of the efficacy and safety of dasatinib in this population. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with imatinib-resistant (n = 161) or -intolerant (n = 13) CML-AP received dasatinib 70 mg orally twice daily. Results At a median follow-up of 14.1 months (treatment duration, 0.1 to 21.7 months), major and complete hematologic responses were attained by 64% and 45% of patients, respectively, and major and complete cytogenetic responses were achieved in 39% and 32% of patients, respectively. Responses were achieved irrespective of imatinib status (resistant or intolerant), prior stem-cell transplantation, or the presence of prior BCR-ABL mutation. The 12-month progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 66% and 82%, respectively. Dasatinib was generally well tolerated; the most frequent nonhematologic severe treatment-related adverse event was diarrhea (52%; grade 3 to 4, 8%). Cytopenias were common, including grade 3 to 4 neutropenia (76%) and thrombocytopenia (82%). Pleural effusion occurred in 27% of patients (grade 3 to 4, 5%).

Fifteen genes in the panel distinguished blast phase from chronic phase disease, and 12 genes distinguished newly diagnosed CML from TKI-resistant CML without ABL1 kinase domain mutations, but only a single gene, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1/cyclooxgenase 1 (PTGS1/COX1; P = .005), differentiated imatinib-responsive from primary imatinib-resistant CML. The association of primary imatinib resistance with higher transcript levels of the drug metabolism gene PTGS1 was confirmed in a separate data set of 68 newly diagnosed, imatinib-treated CML (P = .008). In contrast, up to 11 different genes were identified in a multivariate model that optimally discriminated secondary imatinib resistance lacking ABL1 kinase domain mutation from imatinib-responsive cases, likely related to the more complex pathogenesis of secondary resistance. Gene expression profiling of CML at diagnosis for PTGS1 may be useful in predicting imatinib response and in selecting alternate therapy.",Comparative Study,3879.0,69.0,A subset of patients with chronic myelogenous CML do not respond to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor TKI imatinib mesylate Such primary imatinib resistance is distinguished from secondary resistance which reemerges after attainment of cytogenetic remission We studied gene expression patterns in total WBCs using a panel of 21 genes previously implicated in TKI handling resistance or progression comparing patients who had newly diagnosed TKI-naive CML that had optimal n 41 or suboptimal n 7 responses to imatinib or primary resistance n 20 Expression patterns were compared to those in secondary TKI-resistant chronic phase CML without ABL1 kinase domain mutations n 29 and to lymphoid n 15 or myeloid blast phase disease n 12 Fifteen genes in the panel distinguished blast phase from chronic phase disease and 12 genes distinguished newly diagnosed CML from TKI-resistant CML without ABL1 kinase domain mutations but only a single gene prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1/cyclooxgenase 1 PTGS1/COX1 P .005 differentiated imatinib-responsive from primary imatinib-resistant CML The association of primary imatinib resistance with higher transcript levels of the drug metabolism gene PTGS1 was confirmed in a separate data set of 68 newly diagnosed imatinib-treated CML P .008 In contrast up to 11 different genes were identified in a multivariate model that optimally discriminated secondary imatinib resistance lacking ABL1 kinase domain mutation from imatinib-responsive cases likely related to the more complex pathogenesis of secondary resistance Gene expression profiling of CML at diagnosis for PTGS1 may be useful in predicting imatinib response and in selecting alternate therapy,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[8, 697, 1, 7, 5, 442, 2194, 903, 1022, 44, 1892, 6, 3, 564, 216, 230, 1379, 577, 2347, 225, 86, 577, 251, 16, 4735, 29, 568, 251, 92, 57961, 50, 7108, 1, 1266, 734, 21, 656, 145, 55, 764, 4, 181, 17238, 75, 8, 993, 1, 239, 214, 373, 1771, 4, 1379, 13658, 251, 15, 91, 1430, 7, 54, 42, 732, 265, 1379, 2462, 903, 17, 42, 665, 78, 605, 15, 3291, 78, 67, 253, 6, 577, 15, 86, 251, 78, 179, 55, 764, 11, 72, 6, 135, 4, 568, 1379, 436, 442, 124, 903, 187, 3557, 216, 1398, 138, 78, 462, 2, 6, 2303, 78, 167, 15, 533, 3112, 124, 34, 78, 133, 3057, 214, 4, 3, 993, 4735, 3112, 124, 29, 442, 124, 34, 2, 133, 214, 4735, 732, 265, 903, 29, 1379, 436, 903, 187, 3557, 216, 1398, 138, 84, 158, 8, 226, 145, 6068, 21561, 3522, 14, 57962, 14, 34701, 31465, 19, 1614, 1442, 577, 2443, 29, 86, 577, 436, 903, 3, 248, 1, 86, 577, 251, 5, 142, 3268, 148, 1, 3, 234, 1600, 145, 34701, 10, 557, 4, 8, 2282, 74, 916, 1, 806, 732, 265, 577, 73, 903, 19, 2155, 4, 748, 126, 6, 175, 338, 214, 11, 108, 4, 8, 331, 202, 17, 5074, 8752, 568, 577, 251, 1941, 3557, 216, 1398, 258, 29, 577, 2443, 140, 322, 139, 6, 3, 80, 840, 1384, 1, 568, 251, 145, 55, 1080, 1, 903, 28, 147, 9, 34701, 68, 40, 999, 4, 1434, 577, 51, 2, 4, 3675, 4689, 36]",1689.0,19506164,1
Synthetic tumor-specific breakpoint peptide vaccine in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and minimal residual disease: a phase 2 trial.,Cancer,Cancer,2009-09-01,"Imatinib is the current standard frontline therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In the majority of patients, imatinib induces a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR); however, complete molecular responses are infrequent. The Bcr-Abl fusion creates a unique sequence of amino acids that could constitute a target for immunomodulation. A mixture of heteroclitic and native peptides derived from both b3a2 and b2a2 sequences was used to vaccinate patients with CML in CCyR who were receiving imatinib therapy and who had stable Bcr-Abl transcript levels. Ten patients were enrolled, all with b2a2 transcripts (including 2 patients who had coexpression of b2a2 and b3a2). Patients had received imatinib for a median of 62 months. Three of 10 patients achieved 1-log reduction in Bcr-Abl transcript levels, including the 2 patients who had received previous interferon therapy, and 3 other patients achieved a major molecular response. The vaccine was tolerated well, and there were no grade > or =3 adverse events. Vaccination did not affect the leukocyte profiles in peripheral blood except for regulatory T cells, which were down-regulated briefly during the late stage of vaccination in patients who achieved approximately 1-log reduction in Bcr-Abl transcript levels. The current data suggested that vaccination-related transient disruption of immune tolerance may contribute to the reduction in Bcr-Abl transcripts. Clinically, this Bcr-Abl peptide vaccine may transiently improve the molecular response in a subset of patients with CML.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",3794.0,44.0,Imatinib is the current standard frontline therapy for chronic myelogenous CML In the majority of patients imatinib induces a complete cytogenetic response CCyR however complete molecular responses are infrequent The Bcr-Abl fusion creates a unique sequence of amino acids that could constitute a target for immunomodulation A mixture of heteroclitic and native peptides derived from both b3a2 and b2a2 sequences was used to vaccinate patients with CML in CCyR who were receiving imatinib therapy and who had stable Bcr-Abl transcript levels Ten patients were enrolled all with b2a2 transcripts including 2 patients who had coexpression of b2a2 and b3a2 Patients had received imatinib for a median of 62 months Three of 10 patients achieved 1-log reduction in Bcr-Abl transcript levels including the 2 patients who had received previous interferon therapy and 3 other patients achieved a major molecular response The vaccine was tolerated well and there were no grade or =3 adverse events Vaccination did not affect the leukocyte profiles in peripheral blood except for regulatory T cells which were down-regulated briefly during the late stage of vaccination in patients who achieved approximately 1-log reduction in Bcr-Abl transcript levels The current data suggested that vaccination-related transient disruption of immune tolerance may contribute to the reduction in Bcr-Abl transcripts Clinically this Bcr-Abl peptide vaccine may transiently improve the molecular response in a subset of patients with CML,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[577, 16, 3, 291, 260, 3171, 36, 9, 442, 2194, 903, 4, 3, 686, 1, 7, 577, 1516, 8, 236, 1266, 51, 6412, 137, 236, 219, 253, 32, 4475, 3, 1062, 1425, 1212, 9803, 8, 991, 1532, 1, 3078, 4562, 17, 359, 4999, 8, 283, 9, 12066, 8, 6972, 1, 26148, 2, 4646, 2491, 526, 29, 110, 24460, 2, 28922, 2866, 10, 95, 6, 25022, 7, 5, 903, 4, 6412, 54, 11, 357, 577, 36, 2, 54, 42, 585, 1062, 1425, 3268, 148, 1618, 7, 11, 346, 62, 5, 28922, 2680, 141, 18, 7, 54, 42, 7588, 1, 28922, 2, 24460, 7, 42, 103, 577, 9, 8, 52, 1, 744, 53, 169, 1, 79, 7, 513, 14, 1066, 628, 4, 1062, 1425, 3268, 148, 141, 3, 18, 7, 54, 42, 103, 698, 1688, 36, 2, 27, 127, 7, 513, 8, 458, 219, 51, 3, 1274, 10, 421, 149, 2, 125, 11, 77, 88, 15, 27, 290, 281, 1915, 205, 44, 1158, 3, 3627, 1241, 4, 672, 315, 2187, 9, 1253, 102, 37, 92, 11, 1328, 1065, 6277, 190, 3, 807, 82, 1, 1915, 4, 7, 54, 513, 705, 14, 1066, 628, 4, 1062, 1425, 3268, 148, 3, 291, 74, 1148, 17, 1915, 139, 2473, 3220, 1, 250, 2614, 68, 1248, 6, 3, 628, 4, 1062, 1425, 2680, 505, 26, 1062, 1425, 1389, 1274, 68, 9235, 401, 3, 219, 51, 4, 8, 697, 1, 7, 5, 903]",1511.0,19536894,250
RIZ1 is potential CML tumor suppressor that is down-regulated during disease progression.,Journal of hematology & oncology,J Hematol Oncol,2009-07-14,"RIZ1 expression and activity are reduced in many cancers. In AML cell lines and patient material, RIZ1 expression is reduced relative to normal bone marrow. In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), blastic transformation is associated with loss of heterozygosity in the region where RIZ1 is located. RIZ1 is a PR domain methyltransferase that methylates histone H3 lysine 9, a modification important for transcriptional repression. In CML blast crisis cell lines RIZ1 represses insulin-like growth factor-1 expression and autocrine signaling. Together these observations suggest that RIZ1 may have a role in the chronic phase to blast crisis transition in CML. In CML patient material, we observed that RIZ1 expression was decreased during progression from chronic phase to blast crisis. RIZ1 was expressed in mature myeloid and CD34+ cells demonstrating that decreased RIZ1 expression in blast crisis is not due to an increased immature cell population. Expression of RIZ1 CML blast crisis cell lines decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis, and enhanced differentiation. RIZ1 is a candidate tumor suppressor gene whose expression is decreased in blast crisis. Loss of RIZ1 activity results in decreased apoptosis and differentiation and enhanced proliferation.

NCCN task force report: molecular markers in leukemias and lymphomas.,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,2009-07-01,"The introduction of targeted therapies has revolutionized treatment and improved outcomes in patients with leukemias and lymphomas. However, many patients experience relapse caused by the persistence of residual malignant cells. Cytogenetic and molecular techniques are increasingly being used to assess and quantify minimal residual disease (MRD). The emergence of advanced technologies has led to the discovery of multiple novel molecular markers that can be used to detect MRD and predict outcome in patients with leukemias and lymphomas. Gene expression signatures that predict clinical outcomes in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma have been identified. In chronic myelogenous leukemia, molecular monitoring has become more important in assessing response and detecting resistance to therapy.

"Inhibitors of deacetylases suppress oncogenic KIT signaling, acetylate HSP90, and induce apoptosis in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.",Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2009-08-25,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are characterized by activating mutations of KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA), and treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib yields responses in the majority of patients. However, most patients develop secondary resistance, which is associated with a dismal prognosis. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI) have been shown to enhance imatinib activity in imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia. Against this background, we explored whether HDACI might provide an alternative therapeutic strategy to KIT/PDGFRA kinase inhibitors in GIST. Inhibition of cell proliferation by HDACI was seen in KIT-positive but not in KIT-negative GIST cell lines, suggesting that HDACI activity is mainly conferred by targeting oncogenic KIT. KIT activity, expression, and activation of downstream pathways were strongly inhibited by several HDACI (SAHA, LBH589, VPA, trichostatin A, and NaButyrate). SAHA and LBH589 induced apoptosis in KIT-positive GIST, and strong synergism with imatinib was observed at low concentrations of SAHA and LBH589. Mechanistically, treatment with HDACI reduced KIT mRNA transcript levels and led to strong acetylation of HSP90, interfering with its activity as KIT chaperone. These results provide preclinical evidence for a disease-specific effect of HDACI in KIT-positive GIST, which could translate into therapeutic activity.",Journal Article,3801.0,62.0,stromal tumors GIST are characterized by activating mutations of KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor A PDGFRA and treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib yields responses in the majority of patients However most patients develop secondary resistance which is associated with a dismal prognosis Histone deacetylase inhibitors HDACI have been shown to enhance imatinib activity in imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous Against this background we explored whether HDACI might provide an alternative therapeutic strategy to KIT/PDGFRA kinase inhibitors in GIST Inhibition of cell proliferation by HDACI was seen in KIT-positive but not in KIT-negative GIST cell lines suggesting that HDACI activity is mainly conferred by targeting oncogenic KIT KIT activity expression and activation of downstream pathways were strongly inhibited by several HDACI SAHA LBH589 VPA trichostatin A and NaButyrate SAHA and LBH589 induced apoptosis in KIT-positive GIST and strong synergism with imatinib was observed at low concentrations of SAHA and LBH589 Mechanistically treatment with HDACI reduced KIT mRNA transcript levels and led to strong acetylation of HSP90 interfering with its activity as KIT chaperone These results provide preclinical evidence for a disease-specific effect of HDACI in KIT-positive GIST which could translate into therapeutic activity,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1126, 57, 1394, 32, 765, 20, 1616, 138, 1, 1164, 15, 1596, 526, 129, 161, 153, 8, 4006, 2, 24, 5, 3, 564, 216, 230, 577, 4788, 253, 4, 3, 686, 1, 7, 137, 96, 7, 690, 568, 251, 92, 16, 41, 5, 8, 3929, 356, 1508, 2732, 222, 4265, 47, 85, 443, 6, 1304, 577, 128, 4, 577, 436, 442, 2194, 480, 26, 2426, 21, 1443, 317, 4265, 822, 377, 35, 1091, 189, 692, 6, 1164, 4006, 216, 222, 4, 1394, 297, 1, 31, 457, 20, 4265, 10, 527, 4, 1164, 109, 84, 44, 4, 1164, 199, 1394, 31, 285, 802, 17, 4265, 128, 16, 2615, 3851, 20, 529, 1302, 1164, 1164, 128, 55, 2, 363, 1, 1489, 460, 11, 1327, 879, 20, 392, 4265, 5484, 11339, 6770, 13824, 8, 2, 58193, 5484, 2, 11339, 277, 351, 4, 1164, 109, 1394, 2, 1082, 6494, 5, 577, 10, 164, 28, 154, 1003, 1, 5484, 2, 11339, 4187, 24, 5, 4265, 405, 1164, 956, 3268, 148, 2, 836, 6, 1082, 4145, 1, 2515, 3449, 5, 211, 128, 22, 1164, 7255, 46, 99, 377, 693, 241, 9, 8, 34, 112, 254, 1, 4265, 4, 1164, 109, 1394, 92, 359, 4509, 237, 189, 128]",1369.0,19706776,273
Triptolide induces cell death independent of cellular responses to imatinib in blast crisis chronic myelogenous leukemia cells including quiescent CD34+ primitive progenitor cells.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2009-09-01,"The advent of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) has revolutionized the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, resistance evolves due to BCR-ABL mutations and other mechanisms. Furthermore, patients with blast crisis CML are less responsive and quiescent CML stem cells are insensitive to these inhibitors. We found that triptolide, a diterpenoid, at nanomolar concentrations, promoted equally significant death of KBM5 cells, a cell line derived from a Bcr-Abl-bearing blast crisis CML patient and KBM5STI571 cells, an imatinib-resistant KBM5 subline bearing the T315I mutation. Similarly, Ba/F3 cells harboring mutated BCR-ABL were as sensitive as Ba/F3Bcr-Abl(p210wt) cells to triptolide. Importantly, triptolide induced apoptosis in primary samples from blast crisis CML patients, who showed resistance to Bcr-Abl TKIs in vivo, with less toxicity to normal cells. Triptolide decreased X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, Mcl-1, and Bcr-Abl protein levels in K562, KBM5, and KBM5STI571 cells and in cells from blast crisis CML patients. It sensitized KBM5, but not KBM5STI571, cells to imatinib. More importantly, triptolide also induced death of quiescent CD34(+) CML progenitor cells, a major problem in the therapy of CML with TKIs. Collectively, these results suggest that triptolide potently induces blast crisis CML cell death independent of the cellular responses to Bcr-Abl TKIs, suggesting that triptolide could eradicate residual quiescent CML progenitor cells in TKI-treated patients and benefit TKI-resistant blast crisis CML patients.",Journal Article,3794.0,27.0,The advent of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors TKI has revolutionized the treatment of chronic myelogenous CML However resistance evolves due to BCR-ABL mutations and other mechanisms Furthermore patients with blast crisis CML are less responsive and quiescent CML stem cells are insensitive to these inhibitors We found that triptolide a diterpenoid at nanomolar concentrations promoted equally significant death of KBM5 cells a cell line derived from a Bcr-Abl-bearing blast crisis CML patient and KBM5STI571 cells an imatinib-resistant KBM5 subline bearing the T315I mutation Similarly Ba/F3 cells harboring mutated BCR-ABL were as sensitive as Ba/F3Bcr-Abl p210wt cells to triptolide Importantly triptolide induced apoptosis in primary samples from blast crisis CML patients who showed resistance to Bcr-Abl TKIs in vivo with less toxicity to normal cells Triptolide decreased X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein Mcl-1 and Bcr-Abl protein levels in K562 KBM5 and KBM5STI571 cells and in cells from blast crisis CML patients It sensitized KBM5 but not KBM5STI571 cells to imatinib More importantly triptolide also induced death of quiescent CD34 CML progenitor cells a major problem in the therapy of CML with TKIs Collectively these results suggest that triptolide potently induces blast crisis CML cell death independent of the cellular responses to Bcr-Abl TKIs suggesting that triptolide could eradicate residual quiescent CML progenitor cells in TKI-treated patients and benefit TKI-resistant blast crisis CML patients,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 4114, 1, 1062, 1425, 564, 216, 222, 1379, 71, 5746, 3, 24, 1, 442, 2194, 903, 137, 251, 10413, 520, 6, 1062, 1425, 138, 2, 127, 483, 798, 7, 5, 3112, 6540, 903, 32, 299, 2443, 2, 6735, 903, 452, 37, 32, 7422, 6, 46, 222, 21, 204, 17, 19212, 8, 25189, 28, 7927, 1003, 2992, 4142, 93, 273, 1, 10822, 37, 8, 31, 328, 526, 29, 8, 1062, 1425, 1894, 3112, 6540, 903, 69, 2, 39089, 37, 35, 577, 436, 10822, 28178, 1894, 3, 6184, 258, 1813, 6669, 6904, 37, 2105, 1185, 1062, 1425, 11, 22, 745, 22, 6669, 58215, 1425, 58216, 37, 6, 19212, 1859, 19212, 277, 351, 4, 86, 347, 29, 3112, 6540, 903, 7, 54, 224, 251, 6, 1062, 1425, 1671, 4, 386, 5, 299, 155, 6, 295, 37, 19212, 340, 1006, 1199, 230, 1, 351, 178, 1308, 14, 2, 1062, 1425, 178, 148, 4, 5208, 10822, 2, 39089, 37, 2, 4, 37, 29, 3112, 6540, 903, 7, 192, 4242, 10822, 84, 44, 39089, 37, 6, 577, 80, 1859, 19212, 120, 277, 273, 1, 6735, 2215, 903, 2520, 37, 8, 458, 2497, 4, 3, 36, 1, 903, 5, 1671, 2535, 46, 99, 309, 17, 19212, 4684, 1516, 3112, 6540, 903, 31, 273, 306, 1, 3, 763, 253, 6, 1062, 1425, 1671, 802, 17, 19212, 359, 5650, 753, 6735, 903, 2520, 37, 4, 1379, 73, 7, 2, 247, 1379, 436, 3112, 6540, 903, 7]",1532.0,19723894,111

We looked for dose effects and identified low and high dose smoking groups (>10 pack years, >1 pack per day). Outcomes were adjusted for known prognostic variables including the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT) risk score. In multivariate analyses of sibling allograft recipients, relapse risk (RR) was higher (RR=1.67, P=.003) in smokers than NS, but the dose effects were not consistent. High-dose smokers experienced a 50% treatment-related mortality (TRM) versus 28% in the NS group at 5 years on univariate analysis, and the RR was 1.57 (P=.005) on multivariate analysis. Overall survival (OS) at 5 years was 68% in NS versus 62% in the low-dose smoking group versus 50% in the high-dose smoking group (P < .001). Smoking did not significantly affect outcomes in unrelated donor recipients, but numbers were smaller.

Advances in treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia--new treatment options with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2009-12-01,"Imatinib is considered standard therapy for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), inducing a high rate of hematologic and cytogenetic responses. Despite these excellent results, several patients develop resistance to imatinib. Mechanisms of resistance are varied and include BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations, decreased entry of imatinib into cells, acquisition of secondary genetic changes and activation of alternate signaling pathways. Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (dasatinib, nilotinib) were developed as an alternative for patients that develop resistance or are intolerant to imatinib. Dasatinib is a dual Abl/Src kinase TKI that is structurally unrelated to imatinib and is approved for therapy of all phases of CML in patients who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Nilotinib is a compound related to imatinib that has greater specificity and improved binding characteristics, and has clinical activity in the setting of imatinib failure.

In vitro pharmacokinetic properties, including specific and nonspecific binding of (124)I-SKI230 to its Abl kinase target and interaction with other PKIs, were assessed in cell-free medium and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells overexpressing BCR-Abl (K562), in comparison with BT-474 cells that are low in Abl expression. In a xenograft tumor model, we assessed the in vivo pharmacokinetics of (124)I-SKI230 using PET and postmortem tissue sampling. We also tested a paradigm of (124)I-SKI230 PET after treatment of the animal with a dose of Abl-specific PKI for the monitoring of the tumor response. In vitro studies confirmed that SKI230 binds to Abl kinase with nanomolar affinity, that selective uptake occurs in cell lines known to express Abl kinase, that RNAi knock-down supports specificity of cellular uptake due to Abl kinase, and that imatinib, an archetype Abl PKI, completely displaces SKI230. With SKI230, we obtained successful in vivo PET of Abl-expressing human tumors in a nude rat. We were also able to demonstrate evidence of substrate inhibition of in vivo radiotracer uptake in the xenograft tumor after treatment of the animal as a model of PKI treatment monitoring.

Efficacious immune therapy in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) recognizes antigens that are expressed on CML progenitor cells.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2010-01-26,"Curative effects of graft-versus-leukemia-based therapies such as donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) may result from immunologic ablation of self-renewing CML progenitor cells. Patients who achieved durable remissions after DLI developed a significant B-cell lymphocytosis after treatment, which did not occur in patients who were unresponsive to DLI. In this study, we identified antigen targets of this B-cell response by probing two immunoproteomic platforms with plasma immunoglobulins from seven CML patients with clinically apparent graft-versus-leukemia responses after DLI. In total, 62 antigens elicited greater reactivity from post-DLI versus pre-DLI plasma. Microarray analysis revealed that >70% of the antigens were expressed in CML CD34(+) cells, suggesting that expression in malignant progenitor cells is a feature common to antibody targets of DLI. We confirmed elevated expression of three target antigens (RAB38, TBCE, and DUSP12) in CML that together consistently elicited antibody responses in 18 of 21 of an additional cohort of CML patients with therapeutic responses, but not in normal donors and rarely in non-CML patients.

Optimizing therapy for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-03-01,"Identification of BCR-ABL as the defining leukemogenic event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) revolutionized the treatment of the disease. Imatinib, a potent BCR-ABL inhibitor, is the standard of care for the first-line treatment of patients with chronic-phase CML because of its high long-term response rates and favorable tolerability profile compared with previous standard therapies. However, resistance to imatinib develops in 2% to 4% of patients annually. For patients with acquired cytogenetic resistance to standard-dose imatinib (400 mg daily), imatinib dose escalation (600-800 mg daily) is an excellent first option for managing patients and achieving cytogenetic responses. However, for patients with primary resistance to imatinib, hematologic disease recurrence, or emergent BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations, imatinib dose escalation may not be sufficient to control the disease. For these patients, the potent second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors dasatinib and nilotinib are available. Both agents provide effective therapeutic options for patients with imatinib resistance or intolerance. For the current overview, the authors reviewed the data supporting the use of both dasatinib and nilotinib in imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant patients, and they have highlighted the future of CML therapy.

A phase 3 study (n = 611) assessed the efficacy and safety of dasatinib 140 mg once daily versus 70 mg twice-daily in patients with advanced phase chronic myelogenous leukemia or Ph+ ALL resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Here, results from the Ph+ ALL subset (n = 84) with a 2-year follow-up are reported. Patients were randomly assigned to receive dasatinib either 140 mg once daily (n = 40) or 70 mg twice daily (n = 44). The rate of confirmed major hematologic response with once-daily dosing (38%) was similar to that with twice-daily dosing (32%). The rate of major cytogenetic response with once-daily dosing (70%) was higher than that with twice-daily dosing (52%). Compared with the twice-daily schedule, the once-daily schedule had longer progression-free survival (median, 3.0 months versus 4.0 months, respectively) and shorter overall survival (median, 9.1 months versus 6.5 months, respectively). Overall safety profiles were similar between two groups, with nonhematologic adverse events being mostly grade 1 or 2. Pleural effusion was less frequent with once-daily dosing than with twice-daily dosing (all grades, 18% versus 32%).

We analyzed a cohort of 46 CML patients who participated in a graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis clinical trial and underwent related HLA-matched allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. The median time of follow-up in surviving patients was 43 months (range: 4-89 months). Risk stratification of the population was done by European Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT) criteria. The estimated probabilities of overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 3 years in low EBMT risk score (0-2) patients were both 91%, respectively.

Summary of 615 patients of chronic myeloid leukemia in Shanghai from 2001 to 2006.,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res.,2010-03-03,"To retrospectively review the incidence, treatment efficacy, we followed up newly diagnosed chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients residing in Shanghai during 2001-2006. All eligible cases were reviewed with the data of efficacy responses as well as overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) time. A total of 615 cases entered the study. CML mainly afflicted those aged 40-60 years old and was slightly more frequent in males than females. More than 85% of the patients were in chronic phase (CP) when diagnosed. All patients were divided into four groups based on the main regimens - hydroxyurea, interferon alpha (IFN-alpha), imatinib, and hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). With the median follow-up of 18 months, imatinib treatment induced 92.2% complete hematologic responses, and 64.3% complete cytogenetic responses among CML-CP patients. Overall the therapeutic efficacy in the imatinib group was higher than that in the hydroxyurea or IFN-alpha group. Meanwhile, in the imatinib group, all response rates of patients in CP were significantly greater than that in accelerated or blastic crisis phase.

Effect of age on outcome of reduced-intensity hematopoietic cell transplantation for older patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission or with myelodysplastic syndrome.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2010-03-08,"PURPOSE Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) primarily afflict older individuals. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is generally not offered because of concerns of excess morbidity and mortality. Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens allow increased use of allogeneic HCT for older patients. To define prognostic factors impacting long-term outcomes of RIC regimens in patients older than age 40 years with AML in first complete remission or MDS and to determine the impact of age, we analyzed data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR). PATIENTS AND METHODS We reviewed data reported to the CIBMTR (1995 to 2005) on 1,080 patients undergoing RIC HCT. Outcomes analyzed included neutrophil recovery, incidence of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS Univariate analyses demonstrated no age group differences in NRM, grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, or relapse. Patients age 40 to 54, 55 to 59, 60 to 64, and > or = 65 years had 2-year survival rates as follows: 44% (95% CI, 37% to 52%), 50% (95% CI, 41% to 59%), 34% (95% CI, 25% to 43%), and 36% (95% CI, 24% to 49%), respectively, for patients with AML (P = .06); and 42% (95% CI, 35% to 49%), 35% (95% CI, 27% to 43%), 45% (95% CI, 36% to 54%), and 38% (95% CI, 25% to 51%), respectively, for patients with MDS (P = .37). Multivariate analysis revealed no significant impact of age on NRM, relapse, DFS, or OS (all P > .3). Greater HLA disparity adversely affected 2-year NRM, DFS, and OS. Unfavorable cytogenetics adversely impacted relapse, DFS, and OS. Better pre-HCT performance status predicted improved 2-year OS.

Molecular targeted therapies in head and neck cancer--an update of recent developments-.,Head & neck oncology,Head Neck Oncol,2010-04-14,"Targeted therapies have made their way into clinical practice during the past decade. They have caused a major impact on the survival of cancer patients in many areas of clinical oncology and hematology. Indeed, in some hematologic malignancies, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, biologicals and antibodies specifically designed to target tumour-specific proteins have revolutionized treatment standards. In solid tumours, new drugs targeting EGF- or VEGF- receptors are now approved and are entering clinical practise for treatment of colon, lung, kidney and other cancers, either alone or in combination with conventional treatment approaches. Recent data have now shown that molecular targeted therapy might display efficacy in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as well. The evaluated biologicals are generally well tolerated from HNSCC patients, who usually have the burden of multiple co-morbidities that interfere with conventional systemic treatment options. Therefore, molecular targeted therapies offer new treatment options even for heavily pretreated and seriously ill patients usually unable to tolerate chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The two most promising and advanced strategies are the blockage of growth-factor based cellular signalling and interference with angiogenesis-related pathways. But inhibitors of alternative targets, such as Scr and proteasomes, have already been evaluated in early clinical trials with HNSCC patients.",Journal Article,3569.0,55.0,Targeted therapies have made their way into clinical practice during the past decade They have caused a major impact on the survival of cancer patients in many areas of clinical oncology and hematology Indeed in some hematologic malignancies such as chronic myelogenous or 's lymphomas biologicals and antibodies specifically designed to target tumour-specific proteins have revolutionized treatment standards In solid tumours new drugs targeting EGF- or VEGF- receptors are now approved and are entering clinical practise for treatment of and other cancers either alone or in combination with conventional treatment approaches Recent data have now shown that molecular targeted therapy might display efficacy in patients with head and squamous cell carcinoma HNSCC as well The evaluated biologicals are generally well tolerated from HNSCC patients who usually have the burden of multiple co-morbidities that interfere with conventional systemic treatment options Therefore molecular targeted therapies offer new treatment options even for heavily pretreated and seriously ill patients usually unable to tolerate chemotherapy or radiation therapy The two most promising and advanced strategies are the blockage of growth-factor based cellular signalling and interference with angiogenesis-related pathways But inhibitors of alternative targets such as Scr and proteasomes have already been evaluated in early clinical trials with HNSCC patients,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[238, 235, 47, 1229, 136, 2255, 237, 38, 758, 190, 3, 1219, 2025, 491, 47, 1546, 8, 458, 345, 23, 3, 25, 1, 12, 7, 4, 445, 1361, 1, 38, 413, 2, 6216, 4462, 4, 476, 813, 441, 225, 22, 442, 2194, 15, 292, 1557, 45980, 2, 890, 1225, 1114, 6, 283, 770, 112, 652, 47, 5746, 24, 3371, 4, 537, 1319, 217, 600, 529, 3114, 15, 618, 1186, 32, 1134, 850, 2, 32, 7653, 38, 45981, 9, 24, 1, 2, 127, 163, 361, 279, 15, 4, 150, 5, 809, 24, 611, 435, 74, 47, 1134, 443, 17, 219, 238, 36, 822, 3640, 209, 4, 7, 5, 718, 2, 691, 31, 134, 1209, 22, 149, 3, 194, 45980, 32, 1228, 149, 421, 29, 1209, 7, 54, 2082, 47, 3, 892, 1, 232, 1269, 5655, 17, 6178, 5, 809, 403, 24, 838, 673, 219, 238, 235, 1918, 217, 24, 838, 871, 9, 2447, 2193, 2, 13158, 4993, 7, 2082, 4253, 6, 5010, 56, 15, 121, 36, 3, 100, 96, 721, 2, 131, 422, 32, 3, 12501, 1, 129, 161, 90, 763, 3128, 2, 3182, 5, 1056, 139, 460, 84, 222, 1, 1091, 637, 225, 22, 9218, 2, 24715, 47, 3298, 85, 194, 4, 191, 38, 143, 5, 1209, 7]",1444.0,20398256,5
Graft-versus-leukemia antigen CML66 elicits coordinated B-cell and T-cell immunity after donor lymphocyte infusion.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2010-05-11,"The target antigens of graft-versus-leukemia that are tumor associated are incompletely characterized. We examined responses developing against CML66, an immunogenic antigen preferentially expressed in myeloid progenitor cells identified from a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia who attained long-lived remission following CD4+ donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). From this patient, CML66-reactive CD8+ T-cell clones were detected against an endogenously presented HLA-B*4403-restricted epitope (HDVDALLW). Neither CML66-specific antibody nor T-cell responses were detectable in peripheral blood before DLI. However, by 1 month after DLI, CD8+ T cells were present in peripheral blood and at 10-fold higher frequency in marrow. Subsequently, plasma antibody to CML66 developed in association with disease remission. Donor-derived CML66-reactive T cells were detected at low levels in vivo in marrow before DLI by ELISpot and by a nested PCR-based assay to detect clonotypic T-cell receptor sequences but not in blood of the patient pre-DLI nor of the graft donor. CD4+ DLI results in rapid expansion of preexisting marrow-resident leukemia-specific donor CD8+ T cells, followed by a cascade of antigen-specific immune responses detectable in blood.

The authors analyzed the outcome of 259 patients with early chronic phase CML treated with imatinib (starting dose 400 mg in 50, 800 mg in 209). Pre-existing liver and/or renal dysfunction was seen in 38 (15%) and 11 (4%) patients, respectively. Dose reductions were required in 91 (43%) of 210 patients with normal organ function, compared with 8 (73%) of 11 (P = .065) with renal dysfunction, and 19 (50%) of 38 (P = .271) with liver dysfunction.

More than 75% of patients achieve complete cytogenetic remission (CCR) after treatment with imatinib, which provides an opportunity to collect minimally involved hematopoietic progenitor stem cell (HPC) products. In order to assess the feasibility of HPC collection in patients with CML, we prospectively enrolled 24 patients who achieved CCR on therapy with imatinib. Two patients could not undergo HPC collection because of coagulopathy. A CD34+ cell yield of > or =2.0 x 10(6)/kg body weight was obtained in 16/22 (73%) patients. Patients who stopped imatinib for at least 3 weeks prior to HPC collection had significantly higher CD34+ cell yields (median: 6.52 x 10(6)/kg body weight) when compared with patients who continued imatinib through the collection (median: 3.74 x 10(6)/kg body weight).

Lyn kinase-dependent regulation of miR181 and myeloid cell leukemia-1 expression: implications for drug resistance in myelogenous leukemia.,Molecular pharmacology,Mol. Pharmacol.,2010-08-06,"Imatinib, a BCR-Abl inhibitor, is a successful front-line treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Despite the success of imatinib, multiple mechanisms of resistance remain a problem, including overexpression of Lyn kinase (Lyn) and Bcl-2 family antiapoptotic proteins. Profiling micro-RNA (miRNA) expression in a model of Lyn-mediated imatinib-resistant CML (MYL-R) identified approximately 30 miRNAs whose expression differed >2-fold compared with drug-sensitive MYL cells. In particular, the expression of the miR181 family (a-d) was significantly reduced (∼11- to 25-fold) in MYL-R cells. Incubation of MYL-R cells with a Lyn inhibitor (dasatinib) or nucleofection with Lyn-targeting short interfering RNA increased miR181b and miR181d expression. A similar Lyn-dependent regulation of miR181b and miR181d was observed in imatinib-resistant K562 CML cells. Sequence analysis of potential targets for miR181 regulation predicted myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), a Bcl-2 family member whose expression is increased in MYL-R cells and drug-resistant leukemias. Inhibition of Lyn or rescue of miR181b expression reduced Mcl-1 expression in the MYL-R cells. To further investigate the mechanism of Mcl-1 repression by miR181, a luciferase reporter construct incorporating the Mcl-1 3'-untranslated region was tested. Overexpression of miR181b reduced luciferase activity, whereas these effects were ablated by the mutation of the seed region of the miR181 target site. Finally, stimulation of Lyn expression by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) treatment in HL-60 cells, a cell model of acute myelogenous leukemia, decreased miR181b expression and increased Mcl-1 expression. In summary, our results suggest that Lyn-dependent regulation of miR181 is a novel mechanism of regulating Mcl-1 expression and cell survival.",Journal Article,3455.0,57.0,"Imatinib a BCR-Abl inhibitor is a successful front-line treatment for chronic myelogenous CML Despite the success of imatinib multiple mechanisms of resistance remain a problem including overexpression of Lyn kinase Lyn and Bcl-2 family antiapoptotic proteins Profiling micro-RNA miRNA expression in a model of Lyn-mediated imatinib-resistant CML MYL-R identified approximately 30 miRNAs whose expression differed 2-fold compared with drug-sensitive MYL cells In particular the expression of the miR181 family a-d was significantly reduced ∼11- to 25-fold in MYL-R cells Incubation of MYL-R cells with a Lyn inhibitor dasatinib or nucleofection with Lyn-targeting short interfering RNA increased miR181b and miR181d expression A similar Lyn-dependent regulation of miR181b and miR181d was observed in imatinib-resistant K562 CML cells Sequence analysis of potential targets for miR181 regulation predicted myeloid cell leukemia-1 Mcl-1 a Bcl-2 family member whose expression is increased in MYL-R cells and drug-resistant leukemias Inhibition of Lyn or rescue of miR181b expression reduced Mcl-1 expression in the MYL-R cells To further investigate the mechanism of Mcl-1 repression by miR181 a luciferase reporter construct incorporating the Mcl-1 3'-untranslated region was tested Overexpression of miR181b reduced luciferase activity whereas these effects were ablated by the mutation of the seed region of the miR181 target site Finally stimulation of Lyn expression by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 treatment in HL-60 cells a cell model of acute myelogenous decreased miR181b expression and increased Mcl-1 expression In summary our results suggest that Lyn-dependent regulation of miR181 is a novel mechanism of regulating Mcl-1 expression and cell survival",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[577, 8, 1062, 1425, 230, 16, 8, 1401, 3007, 328, 24, 9, 442, 2194, 903, 550, 3, 1825, 1, 577, 232, 483, 1, 251, 918, 8, 2497, 141, 851, 1, 8309, 216, 8309, 2, 1044, 18, 607, 4176, 652, 1080, 4659, 893, 2053, 55, 4, 8, 202, 1, 8309, 517, 577, 436, 903, 29041, 668, 108, 705, 201, 2028, 1310, 55, 2512, 18, 1116, 72, 5, 234, 745, 29041, 37, 4, 1454, 3, 55, 1, 3, 25275, 607, 8, 427, 10, 97, 405, 26972, 6, 243, 1116, 4, 29041, 668, 37, 7797, 1, 29041, 668, 37, 5, 8, 8309, 230, 1674, 15, 39400, 5, 8309, 529, 978, 3449, 893, 101, 29042, 2, 46161, 55, 8, 288, 8309, 470, 863, 1, 29042, 2, 46161, 10, 164, 4, 577, 436, 5208, 903, 37, 1532, 65, 1, 174, 637, 9, 25275, 863, 783, 533, 31, 2647, 14, 1308, 14, 8, 1044, 18, 607, 2693, 1310, 55, 16, 101, 4, 29041, 668, 37, 2, 234, 436, 2792, 297, 1, 8309, 15, 4256, 1, 29042, 55, 405, 1308, 14, 55, 4, 3, 29041, 668, 37, 6, 195, 963, 3, 670, 1, 1308, 14, 5255, 20, 25275, 8, 3864, 3674, 3883, 2570, 3, 1308, 14, 5435, 7379, 1053, 10, 650, 851, 1, 29042, 405, 3864, 128, 547, 46, 176, 11, 9463, 20, 3, 258, 1, 3, 5467, 1053, 1, 3, 25275, 283, 606, 1368, 2503, 1, 8309, 55, 20, 14, 243, 11430, 427, 27, 24, 4, 1718, 335, 37, 8, 31, 202, 1, 286, 2194, 340, 29042, 55, 2, 101, 1308, 14, 55, 4, 1962, 114, 99, 309, 17, 8309, 470, 863, 1, 25275, 16, 8, 229, 670, 1, 2681, 1308, 14, 55, 2, 31, 25]",1759.0,20693279,18

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2010-08-10,"Relapse is a major cause of treatment failure after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). Treatment options for relapse have been inadequate, and the majority of patients ultimately die of their disease. There is no standard approach to treating relapse after alloHSCT. Withdrawal of immune suppression and donor lymphocyte infusions are commonly used for all diseases; although these interventions are remarkably effective for relapsed chronic myelogenous leukemia, they have limited efficacy in other hematologic malignancies. Conventional and novel chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, targeted therapies, and second transplants have been utilized in a variety of relapsed diseases, but reports on these therapies are generally anecdotal and retrospective.

Immune modulation of minimal residual disease in early chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia: a randomized trial of frontline high-dose imatinib mesylate with or without pegylated interferon alpha-2b and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-09-30,"Most patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) harbor residual disease, as evidenced by molecular techniques even after treatment with high-dose imatinib (ie, 800 mg/d). Interferon alpha (IFN α) is efficacious in CML likely due to its immunomodulatory properties, and is synergistic in vitro with imatinib and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). A study was undertaken to determine whether adding pegylated (PEG) IFN α-2b and GM-CSF to high-dose imatinib may improve the complete molecular response rate in patients with CML in chronic phase. Ninety-four patients were treated with imatinib 800 mg/d for the first 6 months, then randomly assigned to continue high-dose imatinib alone (n = 49) or in combination with PEG IFN α-2b 0.5 μg/kg/wk and GM-CSF 125 mg/m² 3× weekly (n = 45). The median follow-up for all patients was 54 months (range, 7-70 months). There were no differences in the rates of complete cytogenetic response (87% vs 90%; P = 1.0), or of major (77% vs 77%; P = 1.0) or complete (11% vs 13%; P = 1.0) molecular response (on the international scale) at 12 months between the 2 arms, or at any time during the study. Adverse events led to PEG IFN α-2b discontinuation in all patients. The addition of PEG IFN α-2b and GM-CSF to high-dose imatinib therapy does not improve significantly the cytogenetic or molecular response rates compared with high-dose imatinib alone. The high dropout rate in the PEG IFN α-2b arm may have compromised its potential immunomodulatory benefit.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",3400.0,37.0,Most patients with chronic myelogenous CML harbor residual disease as evidenced by molecular techniques even after treatment with high-dose imatinib ie 800 mg/d Interferon alpha IFN is efficacious in CML likely due to its immunomodulatory properties and is synergistic in vitro with imatinib and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor GM-CSF A study was undertaken to determine whether adding pegylated PEG IFN α-2b and GM-CSF to high-dose imatinib may improve the complete molecular response rate in patients with CML in chronic phase Ninety-four patients were treated with imatinib 800 mg/d for the first 6 months then randomly assigned to continue high-dose imatinib alone n 49 or in combination with PEG IFN α-2b 0.5 μg/kg/wk and GM-CSF 125 mg/m² 3× weekly n 45 The median follow-up for all patients was 54 months range 7-70 months There were no differences in the rates of complete cytogenetic response 87 vs 90 P 1.0 or of major 77 vs 77 P 1.0 or complete 11 vs 13 P 1.0 molecular response on the international scale at 12 months between the 2 arms or at any time during the study Adverse events led to PEG IFN α-2b discontinuation in all patients The addition of PEG IFN α-2b and GM-CSF to high-dose imatinib therapy does not improve significantly the cytogenetic or molecular response rates compared with high-dose imatinib alone The high dropout rate in the PEG IFN α-2b arm may have compromised its potential immunomodulatory benefit,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[96, 7, 5, 442, 2194, 903, 2760, 753, 34, 22, 4728, 20, 219, 1092, 871, 50, 24, 5, 64, 61, 577, 2523, 2796, 81, 427, 1688, 950, 1256, 16, 3289, 4, 903, 322, 520, 6, 211, 2555, 1571, 2, 16, 1806, 4, 439, 5, 577, 2, 2764, 2674, 1975, 2122, 161, 2147, 1211, 8, 45, 10, 2789, 6, 223, 317, 2726, 4424, 3145, 1256, 2014, 3381, 2, 2147, 1211, 6, 64, 61, 577, 68, 401, 3, 236, 219, 51, 116, 4, 7, 5, 903, 4, 442, 124, 2493, 294, 7, 11, 73, 5, 577, 2796, 81, 427, 9, 3, 157, 49, 53, 818, 1108, 896, 6, 1906, 64, 61, 577, 279, 78, 739, 15, 4, 150, 5, 3145, 1256, 2014, 3381, 13, 33, 3802, 503, 3293, 2, 2147, 1211, 1731, 81, 4709, 22635, 709, 78, 512, 3, 52, 166, 126, 9, 62, 7, 10, 667, 53, 184, 67, 431, 53, 125, 11, 77, 362, 4, 3, 151, 1, 236, 1266, 51, 912, 105, 424, 19, 14, 13, 15, 1, 458, 849, 105, 849, 19, 14, 13, 15, 236, 175, 105, 233, 19, 14, 13, 219, 51, 23, 3, 944, 1124, 28, 133, 53, 59, 3, 18, 1335, 15, 28, 500, 98, 190, 3, 45, 290, 281, 836, 6, 3145, 1256, 2014, 3381, 2007, 4, 62, 7, 3, 352, 1, 3145, 1256, 2014, 3381, 2, 2147, 1211, 6, 64, 61, 577, 36, 1097, 44, 401, 97, 3, 1266, 15, 219, 51, 151, 72, 5, 64, 61, 577, 279, 3, 64, 13929, 116, 4, 3, 3145, 1256, 2014, 3381, 475, 68, 47, 4867, 211, 174, 2555, 247]",1453.0,20886606,56
Clofarabine ± fludarabine with once daily i.v. busulfan as pretransplant conditioning therapy for advanced myeloid leukemia and MDS.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2010-10-11,"Although a combination of i.v. busulfan (Bu) and fludarabine (Flu) is a safe, reduced-toxicity conditioning program for acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplastic syndromes (AML/MDS), recurrent leukemia posttransplantation remains a problem. To enhance the conditioning regimen's antileukemic effect, we decided to supplant Flu with clofarabine (Clo), and assayed the interactions of these nucleoside analogs alone and in combination with Bu in Bu-resistant human cell lines in vitro. We found pronounced synergy between each nucleoside and the alkylator but even more enhanced cytotoxic synergy when the nucleoside analogs were combined prior to exposing the cells to Bu. We then designed a 4-arm clinical trial in patients with myeloid leukemia undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Patients were adaptively randomized as follows: Arm I-Clo:Flu 10:30 mg/m(2), Arm II-20:20 mg/m(2), Arm III-30:10 mg/m(2), and Arm IV-single-agent Clo at 40 mg/m(2). The nucleoside analog(s) were/was infused over 1 hour once daily for 4 days, followed on each day by Bu, infused over 3 hours to a pharmacokinetically targeted daily area under the curve (AUC) of 6000 μMol-min ± 10%. Fifty-one patients have been enrolled with a minimum follow-up exceeding 100 days. There were 32 males and 19 females, with a median age of 45 years (range: 6-59). Nine patients had chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (BC: 2, second AP: 3, and tyrosine-kinase inhibitor refractory first chronic phase [CP]: 4). Forty-two patients had AML: 14 were induction failures, 8 in first chemotherapy-refractory relapse, 7 in untreated relapse, 3 in second or subsequent relapse, 4 were in second complete remission (CR), and 3 in second CR without platelet recovery (CRp), 2 were in high-risk CR1. Finally, 1 patient was in first CRp. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was tacrolimus and mini-methorexate (MTX), and those who had an unrelated or 1 antigen-mismatched donor received low-dose rabbit-ATG (Thymoglobulin™). All patients engrafted. Forty-one patients had active leukemia at the time of transplant, and 35 achieved CR (85%). Twenty of the 42 AML patients and 5 of 9 CML patients are alive with a projected median overall survival (OS) of 23 months. Marrow and blood (T cell) chimerism studies at day +100 revealed that both in the lower-dose Clo groups (groups 1+2) and the higher-dose Clo groups (groups 3+4), the patients had a median of 100% donor (T cell)-derived DNA. There has been no secondary graft failure. In the first 100 days, 1 patient died of pneumonia, and 1 of liver GVHD. We conclude that (1) Clo ± Flu with i.v. Bu as pretransplant conditioning is safe in high-risk myeloid leukemia patients; (2) clofarabine is sufficiently immunosuppressive to support allo-SCT in myeloid leukemia; and (3) the median OS of 23 months in this high-risk patient population is encouraging.

Reduced-intensity conditioning followed by related allografts in hematologic malignancies: long-term outcomes most successful in indolent and aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2010-11-01,"Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) extends the curative potential of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to patients with hematologic malignancies unable to withstand myeloablative conditioning. We prospectively analyzed the outcomes of 123 patients (median age, 57 years; range, 23-70 years) with hematologic malignancies treated with a uniform RIC regimen of cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and total-body irradiation (200 cGy) with or without antithymocyte globulin followed by related donor allogeneic HCT at the University of Minnesota between 2002 and 2008. The cohort included 45 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 27 with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 8 with indolent NHL, 10 with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), 10 with myeloma, and 23 with acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, other leukemias, or myeloproliferative disorders. The probability of 4-year overall survival was 73% for patients with indolent NHL, 58% for those with aggressive NHL, 67% for those with HL, 30% for those with AML/MDS, and only 10% for those with myeloma. Corresponding outcomes for relapse in these patients were 0%, 32%, 50%, 33%, and 38%, and those for progression-free survival were 73%, 45%, 27%, 27%, and 10%. The incidence of treatment-related mortality was 14% at day +100 and 22% at 1 year. The incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease was 38% at day +100, and that of chronic graft-versus-host disease was 50% at 2 years.

"Correlations between imatinib pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, adherence, and clinical response in advanced metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST): an emerging role for drug blood level testing?",Cancer treatment reviews,Cancer Treat. Rev.,2010-11-24,"Imatinib is the standard of care for patients with advanced metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), and is also approved for adjuvant treatment in patients at substantial risk of relapse. Studies have shown that maximizing benefit from imatinib depends on long-term administration at recommended doses. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic factors, adherence, and drug-drug interactions can affect exposure to imatinib and impact clinical outcomes. This article reviews the relevance of these factors to imatinib's clinical activity and response in the context of what has been demonstrated in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and in light of new data correlating imatinib exposure to response in patients with GIST. Because of the wide inter-patient variability in drug exposure with imatinib in both CML and GIST, blood level testing (BLT) may play a role in investigating instances of suboptimal response, unusually severe toxicities, drug-drug interactions, and suspected non-adherence. Published clinical data in CML and in GIST were considered, including data from a PK substudy of the B2222 trial correlating imatinib blood levels with clinical responses in patients with GIST. Imatinib trough plasma levels < 1100 ng/mL were associated with lower rates of objective response and faster development of progressive disease in patients with GIST. These findings have been supported by other analyses correlating free imatinib (unbound) levels with response. These results suggest a future application for imatinib BLT in predicting and optimizing therapeutic response. Nevertheless, early estimates of threshold imatinib blood levels must be confirmed prospectively in future studies and elaborated for different patient subgroups.",Journal Article,3345.0,45.0,Imatinib is the standard of care for patients with advanced metastatic stromal tumors GIST and is also approved for adjuvant treatment in patients at substantial risk of relapse Studies have shown that maximizing benefit from imatinib depends on long-term administration at recommended doses Pharmacokinetic PK and pharmacodynamic factors adherence and drug-drug interactions can affect exposure to imatinib and impact clinical outcomes This article reviews the relevance of these factors to imatinib 's clinical activity and response in the context of what has been demonstrated in chronic myelogenous CML and in light of new data correlating imatinib exposure to response in patients with GIST Because of the wide inter-patient variability in drug exposure with imatinib in both CML and GIST blood level testing BLT may play a role in investigating instances of suboptimal response unusually severe toxicities drug-drug interactions and suspected non-adherence Published clinical data in CML and in GIST were considered including data from a PK substudy of the B2222 trial correlating imatinib blood levels with clinical responses in patients with GIST Imatinib trough plasma levels 1100 ng/mL were associated with lower rates of objective response and faster development of progressive disease in patients with GIST These findings have been supported by other analyses correlating free imatinib unbound levels with response These results suggest a future application for imatinib BLT in predicting and optimizing therapeutic response Nevertheless early estimates of threshold imatinib blood levels must be confirmed prospectively in future studies and elaborated for different patient subgroups,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[577, 16, 3, 260, 1, 165, 9, 7, 5, 131, 113, 1126, 57, 1394, 2, 16, 120, 850, 9, 249, 24, 4, 7, 28, 1281, 43, 1, 429, 94, 47, 443, 17, 8260, 247, 29, 577, 3828, 23, 319, 337, 634, 28, 793, 415, 1456, 2395, 2, 2424, 130, 2149, 2, 234, 234, 1286, 122, 1158, 645, 6, 577, 2, 345, 38, 123, 26, 946, 2004, 3, 2088, 1, 46, 130, 6, 577, 292, 38, 128, 2, 51, 4, 3, 1533, 1, 2067, 71, 85, 264, 4, 442, 2194, 903, 2, 4, 1691, 1, 217, 74, 5637, 577, 645, 6, 51, 4, 7, 5, 1394, 408, 1, 3, 1019, 3606, 69, 1982, 4, 234, 645, 5, 577, 4, 110, 903, 2, 1394, 315, 301, 471, 35007, 68, 1343, 8, 200, 4, 3103, 5342, 1, 3291, 51, 15499, 905, 385, 234, 234, 1286, 2, 2768, 220, 2149, 983, 38, 74, 4, 903, 2, 4, 1394, 11, 515, 141, 74, 29, 8, 2395, 13843, 1, 3, 33496, 160, 5637, 577, 315, 148, 5, 38, 253, 4, 7, 5, 1394, 577, 6000, 554, 148, 13079, 997, 542, 11, 41, 5, 280, 151, 1, 461, 51, 2, 5308, 193, 1, 1014, 34, 4, 7, 5, 1394, 46, 272, 47, 85, 2708, 20, 127, 318, 5637, 115, 577, 9589, 148, 5, 51, 46, 99, 309, 8, 508, 1581, 9, 577, 35007, 4, 1434, 2, 4336, 189, 51, 3873, 191, 1423, 1, 2390, 577, 315, 148, 1642, 40, 557, 1143, 4, 508, 94, 2, 26589, 9, 338, 69, 1453]",1697.0,21078547,107
Results of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for chronic myelogenous leukemia patients who failed tyrosine kinase inhibitors after developing BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations.,Blood,Blood,2010-12-14,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is effective therapy for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) but is now mostly indicated for patients who develop resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which can be associated with point mutations in BCR-ABL1. We reviewed the outcomes of imatinib-resistant CML patients (chronic phase, n = 34; accelerated phase [AP], n = 9; and blast phase [BP], n = 4) who underwent HSCT and had BCR-ABL1 sequencing. Mutations were found in 19 patients (40%); 15 of 19 had advanced CML (AP + BP + second chronic phase). Patients with mutations were more likely to transform to AP/BP at time of imatinib failure (69% vs 35%, P = .03). Forty-two patients (89%) responded to HSCT: 32 (68%) had at least a major molecular response. The 2-year event-free survival was 36% and 58% (P = .05) for the mutant and nonmutant groups, respectively; and the 2-year overall survival was 44% and 76% (P = .02), respectively. HSCT is an important salvage option for TKI-resistant patients with or without BCR-ABL1 mutations. Patients with mutations were more likely to develop advanced disease and had worse outcomes after HSCT.

Use of matched unrelated donors compared with matched related donors is associated with lower relapse and superior progression-free survival after reduced-intensity conditioning hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2010-12-27,"As success of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) relies primarily on graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity, increased minor HLA disparity in unrelated compared to related donors could have a significant impact on transplant outcomes. To assess whether use of unrelated donors (URD) engenders more potent GVL in RIC HSCT compared to matched related donors (MRD), we retrospectively studied 433 consecutive T-replete 6/6 HLA matched URD (n = 246) and MRD (n = 187) RIC HSCT for hematologic malignancies at our institution. Diseases included: acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (127), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (71), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (68), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (64), Hodgkin disease (HD) (40), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (25), multiple myeloma (MM) (23), myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) (12), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (7), and other leukemia (1). All received uniform fludarabine and intravenous busulfan conditioning, and GVHD prophylaxis with tacrolimus/mini-methroxate (mini-MTX) or tacrolimus/sirolimus ± mini-MTX. Unrelated donors were younger compared to MRD (median donor age: 33 years versus 52 years, P < .0001), and provided larger CD34(+) products (median CD34(+) cells infused: 8.7 × 10(6)/kg versus 7.5 × 10(6)/kg, P = .002). Distribution of diseases, disease risk, prior transplant, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) status was similar in both cohorts. Cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD (at day +180), 2-year chronic GVHD, and 2-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were 20% versus 16%, 55% versus 50%, and 8% versus 6% in URD and MRD, respectively (P = NS). Cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years was lower in URD, 52% versus 65% (P = .005). With median follow-up of 26.5 and 35.8 months, 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly better in unrelated donor transplants, 39.5% for URD, and 29% for MRD (P = .01).

The STAT5 inhibitor pimozide decreases survival of chronic myelogenous leukemia cells resistant to kinase inhibitors.,Blood,Blood,2011-01-13,"The transcription factor STAT5 is an essential mediator of the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In CML, the BCR/ABL fusion kinase causes the constitutive activation of STAT5, thereby driving the expression of genes promoting survival. BCR/ABL kinase inhibitors have become the mainstay of therapy for CML, although CML cells can develop resistance through mutations in BCR/ABL. To overcome this problem, we used a cell-based screen to identify drugs that inhibit STAT-dependent gene expression. Using this approach, we identified the psychotropic drug pimozide as a STAT5 inhibitor. Pimozide decreases STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation, although it does not inhibit BCR/ABL or other tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, pimozide decreases the expression of STAT5 target genes and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in CML cell lines. Pimozide also selectively inhibits colony formation of CD34(+) bone marrow cells from CML patients. Importantly, pimozide induces similar effects in the presence of the T315I BCR/ABL mutation that renders the kinase resistant to presently available inhibitors. Simultaneously inhibiting STAT5 with pimozide and the kinase inhibitors imatinib or nilotinib shows enhanced effects in inhibiting STAT5 phosphorylation and in inducing apoptosis. Thus, targeting STAT5 may be an effective strategy for the treatment of CML and other myeloproliferative diseases.",Journal Article,3295.0,162.0,The transcription factor STAT5 is an essential mediator of the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous CML In CML the BCR/ABL fusion kinase causes the constitutive activation of STAT5 thereby driving the expression of genes promoting survival BCR/ABL kinase inhibitors have become the mainstay of therapy for CML although CML cells can develop resistance through mutations in BCR/ABL To overcome this problem we used a cell-based screen to identify drugs that inhibit STAT-dependent gene expression Using this approach we identified the psychotropic drug pimozide as a STAT5 inhibitor Pimozide decreases STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation although it does not inhibit BCR/ABL or other tyrosine kinases Furthermore pimozide decreases the expression of STAT5 target genes and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in CML cell lines Pimozide also selectively inhibits colony formation of CD34 marrow cells from CML patients Importantly pimozide induces similar effects in the presence of the T315I BCR/ABL mutation that renders the kinase resistant to presently available inhibitors Simultaneously inhibiting STAT5 with pimozide and the kinase inhibitors imatinib or nilotinib shows enhanced effects in inhibiting STAT5 phosphorylation and in inducing apoptosis Thus targeting STAT5 may be an effective strategy for the treatment of CML and other diseases,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 866, 161, 5517, 16, 35, 1452, 3810, 1, 3, 1384, 1, 442, 2194, 903, 4, 903, 3, 1062, 1425, 1212, 216, 1626, 3, 3178, 363, 1, 5517, 2267, 4057, 3, 55, 1, 214, 2388, 25, 1062, 1425, 216, 222, 47, 1417, 3, 4041, 1, 36, 9, 903, 242, 903, 37, 122, 690, 251, 298, 138, 4, 1062, 1425, 6, 1768, 26, 2497, 21, 95, 8, 31, 90, 2413, 6, 255, 600, 17, 1433, 4168, 470, 145, 55, 75, 26, 353, 21, 108, 3, 24470, 234, 27017, 22, 8, 5517, 230, 27017, 2140, 5517, 564, 982, 242, 192, 1097, 44, 1433, 1062, 1425, 15, 127, 564, 1549, 798, 27017, 2140, 3, 55, 1, 5517, 283, 214, 2, 1516, 31, 417, 1854, 2, 351, 4, 903, 31, 285, 27017, 120, 2382, 1576, 1975, 1264, 1, 2215, 581, 37, 29, 903, 7, 1859, 27017, 1516, 288, 176, 4, 3, 463, 1, 3, 6184, 1062, 1425, 258, 17, 8080, 3, 216, 436, 6, 9083, 390, 222, 3074, 2062, 5517, 5, 27017, 2, 3, 216, 222, 577, 15, 2638, 1949, 651, 176, 4, 2062, 5517, 982, 2, 4, 1958, 351, 631, 529, 5517, 68, 40, 35, 323, 692, 9, 3, 24, 1, 903, 2, 127, 1342]",1346.0,21233313,182

NCCN Task Force report: tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy selection in the management of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia.,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,2011-02-01,"The advent of imatinib has dramatically improved outcomes in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). It has become the standard of care for all patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML based on its successful induction of durable responses in most patients. However, its use is complicated by the development of resistance in some patients. Dose escalation might overcome this resistance if detected early. The second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) dasatinib and nilotinib provide effective therapeutic options for managing patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Recent studies have shown that dasatinib and nilotinib provide quicker and potentially better responses than standard-dose imatinib when used as a first-line treatment. The goal of therapy for patients with CML is the achievement of a complete cytogenetic response, and eventually a major molecular response, to prevent disease progression to accelerated or blast phase. Selecting the appropriate TKI depends on many factors, including disease phase, primary or secondary resistance to TKI, the agent's side effect profile and its relative effectiveness against BCR-ABL mutations, and the patient's tolerance to therapy.

Effective posttransplant antitumor immunity is associated with TLR-stimulating nucleic acid-immunoglobulin complexes in humans.,The Journal of clinical investigation,J. Clin. Invest.,2011-03-14,"Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), whereby donor mononuclear cells are infused into patients, is one of the few effective immunotherapeutic strategies that generate long-lasting tumor remissions. We previously demonstrated that chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients treated with DLI develop high-titer plasma antibodies specific for CML-associated antigens, the majority of which have been reported to bind nucleic acids These observations led us to predict that circulating antibody-antigen complexes in DLI-responsive patients carry nucleic acids that can engage innate immune sensors. Consistent with this, we report here that post-DLI plasma from 5 CML patients that responded to DLI treatment induced massive upregulation of MIP-1α, IP-10, and IFN-α in normal blood mononuclear cells. Importantly, this was not observed with plasma obtained before DLI and from DLI nonresponders and imatinib-treated patients. This endogenous immunostimulatory activity required nucleic acid and protein for its adjuvant effect and activated antigen-presenting cells through the RNA and DNA sensors TLR8 and TLR9. Presence of the immunoglobulin Fc receptor CD32 enhanced cellular responses, suggesting that immunoglobulins associate with this activity. Finally, a TLR-induced expression signature was detectable in post-DLI but not pre-DLI blood, consistent with an active circulating TLR8/9-stimulating factor. We have therefore demonstrated that effective tumor immunity correlates with the presence of endogenous nucleic acid-immunoglobulin complexes in patient plasma, thus providing a putative mechanism for the induction of potent antigen-specific immunity against malignant cells.",Clinical Trial,3235.0,15.0,Donor lymphocyte infusion DLI whereby donor mononuclear cells are infused into patients is one of the few effective immunotherapeutic strategies that generate long-lasting tumor remissions We previously demonstrated that chronic myelogenous CML patients treated with DLI develop high-titer plasma antibodies specific for CML-associated antigens the majority of which have been reported to bind nucleic acids These observations led us to predict that circulating antibody-antigen complexes in DLI-responsive patients carry nucleic acids that can engage innate immune sensors Consistent with this we report here that post-DLI plasma from 5 CML patients that responded to DLI treatment induced massive upregulation of MIP-1α IP-10 and IFN-α in normal blood mononuclear cells Importantly this was not observed with plasma obtained before DLI and from DLI nonresponders and imatinib-treated patients This endogenous immunostimulatory activity required nucleic acid and protein for its adjuvant effect and activated antigen-presenting cells through the RNA and DNA sensors TLR8 and TLR9 Presence of the immunoglobulin Fc receptor CD32 enhanced cellular responses suggesting that immunoglobulins associate with this activity Finally a TLR-induced expression signature was detectable in post-DLI but not pre-DLI blood consistent with an active circulating TLR8/9-stimulating factor We have therefore demonstrated that effective tumor immunity correlates with the presence of endogenous nucleic acid-immunoglobulin complexes in patient plasma thus providing a putative mechanism for the induction of potent antigen-specific immunity against malignant cells,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1488, 1448, 904, 4676, 6131, 1488, 3041, 37, 32, 4524, 237, 7, 16, 104, 1, 3, 1021, 323, 3222, 422, 17, 2562, 319, 3443, 30, 3166, 21, 373, 264, 17, 442, 2194, 903, 7, 73, 5, 4676, 690, 64, 8444, 554, 890, 112, 9, 903, 41, 1575, 3, 686, 1, 92, 47, 85, 210, 6, 4060, 7895, 4562, 46, 2172, 836, 843, 6, 678, 17, 1033, 548, 448, 3817, 4, 4676, 2443, 7, 3542, 7895, 4562, 17, 122, 7430, 3939, 250, 18867, 925, 5, 26, 21, 414, 467, 17, 539, 4676, 554, 29, 33, 903, 7, 17, 2211, 6, 4676, 24, 277, 7929, 2218, 1, 7076, 3305, 2445, 79, 2, 1256, 2014, 4, 295, 315, 3041, 37, 1859, 26, 10, 44, 164, 5, 554, 683, 348, 4676, 2, 29, 4676, 4498, 2, 577, 73, 7, 26, 2682, 9374, 128, 616, 7895, 971, 2, 178, 9, 211, 249, 254, 2, 735, 448, 1656, 37, 298, 3, 893, 2, 261, 18867, 18599, 2, 11202, 463, 1, 3, 2593, 4127, 153, 28849, 651, 763, 253, 802, 17, 13373, 6446, 5, 26, 128, 1368, 8, 8701, 277, 55, 1651, 10, 2083, 4, 539, 4676, 84, 44, 671, 4676, 315, 925, 5, 35, 544, 1033, 18599, 83, 2122, 161, 21, 47, 673, 264, 17, 323, 30, 1604, 1871, 5, 3, 463, 1, 2682, 7895, 971, 2593, 3817, 4, 69, 554, 631, 1736, 8, 2743, 670, 9, 3, 504, 1, 1157, 448, 112, 1604, 480, 393, 37]",1647.0,21403403,54
"Nilotinib: a novel, selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor.",Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2011-04-01,"The development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) was based on the discovery that CML stem and progenitor cells overexpress the abnormal fusion protein kinase BCR-ABL. The prototype TKI, imatinib, selectively inhibits BCR-ABL, as well as several other kinases, including stem cell factor receptor (KIT), discoidin domain receptor (DDR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and colony-stimulating factor receptor-1 (CSF-1R). Although the management of CML improved dramatically with the introduction of imatinib, not all patients benefit from treatment because of resistance or intolerance. Consequently, research efforts have focused on developing more potent TKIs with the ability to circumvent imatinib resistance. Nilotinib, a second-generation oral TKI, was rationally designed based on the crystal structure of imatinib to be highly active against a wide range of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants and is approved for the treatment of newly diagnosed or imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML, and has shown superiority over imatinib in first-line treatment for newly diagnosed CML. Furthermore, the activity of nilotinib against KIT and PDGFRα has led to its evaluation in advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). The purpose of this review is to describe the development of nilotinib, providing a structural explanation for the differential activity of nilotinib and imatinib in GIST.

Bcr/Abl(+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells, including those resistant to IM (T315I, E255K), were exposed to KW-2449 in the presence or absence of vorinostat or SNDX-275, after which apoptosis and effects on signaling pathways were examined. In vivo studies combining HDACIs and KW2449 were carried out by using a systemic IM-resistant ALL xenograft model. Coadministration of HDACIs synergistically increased KW-2449 lethality in vitro in multiple CML and Ph(+) ALL cell types including human IM resistant cells (e.g., BV-173/E255K and Adult/T315I). Combined treatment resulted in inactivation of Bcr/Abl and downstream targets (e.g., STAT5 and CRKL), as well as increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and DNA damage (γH2A.X). The latter events and cell death were significantly attenuated by free radical scavengers (TBAP). Increased lethality was also observed in primary CD34(+) cells from patients with CML, but not in normal CD34(+) cells. Finally, minimally active vorinostat or SNDX275 doses markedly increased KW2449 antitumor effects and significantly prolonged the survival of murine xenografts bearing IM-resistant ALL cells (BV173/E255K). HDACIs increase KW-2449 lethality in Bcr/Abl(+) cells in association with inhibition of Bcr/Abl, generation of ROS, and induction of DNA damage.

Definitions for EFS-IRIS, time without progression in ENEST-nd, PFS-DASISION, and EFS-MDACC were as previously reported. The EFS-MDACC considered an event any instance of toxicity or death from any cause on or off therapy (if not counted before death as progression/event). Of the 435 patients, 123 (28%) were taken off TKI therapy (resistance/loss of response, n = 33; blastic phase on TKI therapy, n = 6; intolerance/toxicity, n = 29; other causes, n = 55). Thirty-three patients (7.6%) have died; eight patients died on TKI therapy, two patients died within 60 days of being off TKIs, and 23 patients died after being off TKIs for more than 60 days. Of the 33 deaths, 19 deaths (eight deaths on TKI, two deaths within 60 days, and nine deaths off for resistance/relapse/transformation) would be counted as progression/events on the IRIS/ENEST-nd/DASISION studies, whereas 14 deaths would be censored at time off TKI. On the basis of the four definitions used by IRIS, ENEST-nd, DASISION, and MDACC trials, the corresponding 5-year PFS/EFS rates were 96%, 90%, 89%, and 81%.

"Aberrant DNA methylation is associated with disease progression, resistance to imatinib and shortened survival in chronic myelogenous leukemia.",PloS one,PLoS ONE,2011-07-08,"The epigenetic impact of DNA methylation in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is not completely understood. To elucidate its role we analyzed 120 patients with CML for methylation of promoter-associated CpG islands of 10 genes. Five genes were identified by DNA methylation screening in the K562 cell line and 3 genes in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. The CDKN2B gene was selected for its frequent methylation in myeloid malignancies and ABL1 as the target of BCR-ABL translocation. Thirty patients were imatinib-naïve (mostly treated by interferon-alpha before the imatinib era), 30 were imatinib-responsive, 50 were imatinib-resistant, and 10 were imatinib-intolerant. We quantified DNA methylation by bisulfite pyrosequencing. The average number of methylated genes was 4.5 per patient in the chronic phase, increasing significantly to 6.2 in the accelerated and 6.4 in the blastic phase. Higher numbers of methylated genes were also observed in patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib. These patients also showed almost exclusive methylation of a putative transporter OSCP1. Abnormal methylation of a Src suppressor gene PDLIM4 was associated with shortened survival independently of CML stage and imatinib responsiveness. We conclude that aberrant DNA methylation is associated with CML progression and that DNA methylation could be a marker associated with imatinib resistance. Finally, DNA methylation of PDLIM4 may help identify a subset of CML patients that would benefit from treatment with Src/Abl inhibitors.",Journal Article,3119.0,73.0,The epigenetic impact of DNA methylation in chronic myelogenous CML is not completely understood To elucidate its role we analyzed 120 patients with CML for methylation of promoter-associated CpG islands of 10 genes Five genes were identified by DNA methylation screening in the K562 cell line and 3 genes in patients with neoplasms The CDKN2B gene was selected for its frequent methylation in myeloid malignancies and ABL1 as the target of BCR-ABL translocation Thirty patients were imatinib-naïve mostly treated by interferon-alpha before the imatinib era 30 were imatinib-responsive 50 were imatinib-resistant and 10 were imatinib-intolerant We quantified DNA methylation by bisulfite pyrosequencing The average number of methylated genes was 4.5 per patient in the chronic phase increasing significantly to 6.2 in the accelerated and 6.4 in the blastic phase Higher numbers of methylated genes were also observed in patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib These patients also showed almost exclusive methylation of a putative transporter OSCP1 Abnormal methylation of a Src suppressor gene PDLIM4 was associated with shortened survival independently of CML stage and imatinib responsiveness We conclude that aberrant DNA methylation is associated with CML progression and that DNA methylation could be a marker associated with imatinib resistance Finally DNA methylation of PDLIM4 may help identify a subset of CML patients that would benefit from treatment with Src/Abl inhibitors,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1418, 345, 1, 261, 569, 4, 442, 2194, 903, 16, 44, 2500, 1784, 6, 3061, 211, 200, 21, 311, 2031, 7, 5, 903, 9, 569, 1, 973, 41, 2075, 6046, 1, 79, 214, 365, 214, 11, 108, 20, 261, 569, 453, 4, 3, 5208, 31, 328, 2, 27, 214, 4, 7, 5, 1179, 3, 12634, 145, 10, 715, 9, 211, 908, 569, 4, 533, 441, 2, 3557, 22, 3, 283, 1, 1062, 1425, 2006, 977, 7, 11, 577, 2809, 2754, 73, 20, 1688, 950, 348, 3, 577, 1713, 201, 11, 577, 2443, 212, 11, 577, 436, 2, 79, 11, 577, 4944, 21, 2790, 261, 569, 20, 6181, 6031, 3, 1011, 207, 1, 2963, 214, 10, 39, 33, 379, 69, 4, 3, 442, 124, 602, 97, 6, 49, 18, 4, 3, 2241, 2, 49, 39, 4, 3, 6529, 124, 142, 1870, 1, 2963, 214, 11, 120, 164, 4, 7, 436, 15, 4944, 6, 577, 46, 7, 120, 224, 2214, 4804, 569, 1, 8, 2743, 5246, 60351, 1668, 569, 1, 8, 2023, 1245, 145, 46675, 10, 41, 5, 6151, 25, 1042, 1, 903, 82, 2, 577, 3642, 21, 2060, 17, 1898, 261, 569, 16, 41, 5, 903, 91, 2, 17, 261, 569, 359, 40, 8, 952, 41, 5, 577, 251, 1368, 261, 569, 1, 46675, 68, 987, 255, 8, 697, 1, 903, 7, 17, 688, 247, 29, 24, 5, 2023, 1425, 222]",1490.0,21760961,215

Front-line therapy with second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with early chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia: what is the optimal response?,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2011-10-11,"The response definitions proposed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) are defined on the basis of imatinib front-line therapy. It is unknown whether these definitions apply to patients treated with second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). One hundred sixty-seven patients with newly diagnosed chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic phase were treated with second-generation TKIs in phase II trials (nilotinib, 81; dasatinib, 86). Median follow-up was 33 months. Event-free survival (EFS) was measured from the start of treatment to the date of loss of complete hematologic response, loss of complete or major cytogenetic response, discontinuation of therapy for toxicity or lack of efficacy, progression to accelerated or blastic phases, or death at any time. Overall, 155 patients (93%) achieved complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), including 146 (87%) with major molecular response (MMR; complete in 46 patients [28%]). According to the ELN definitions, the rates of suboptimal response were 0%, 2%, 1%, and 12% at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months of therapy, respectively. There was no difference in EFS and CCyR duration between patients who achieved CCyR with and without MMR across all the landmark times of 3, 6, 12, and 18 months. The use of second-generation TKIs as initial therapy in CML induces high rates of CCyR at early time points. The ELN definitions of response proposed for imatinib therapy are not applicable in this setting. We propose that achievement of CCyR and partial cytogenetic response at 3 months should be considered optimal and suboptimal responses, respectively. The achievement of MMR offered no advantage over CCyR in defining long-term outcome in patients with newly diagnosed CML treated with second-generation TKIs.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",3024.0,50.0,The response definitions proposed by the European LeukemiaNet ELN are defined on the basis of imatinib front-line therapy It is unknown whether these definitions apply to patients treated with second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors TKIs One hundred sixty-seven patients with newly diagnosed chronic myelogenous CML in chronic phase were treated with second-generation TKIs in phase II trials nilotinib 81 dasatinib 86 Median follow-up was 33 months Event-free survival EFS was measured from the start of treatment to the date of loss of complete hematologic response loss of complete or major cytogenetic response discontinuation of therapy for toxicity or lack of efficacy progression to accelerated or blastic phases or death at any time Overall 155 patients 93 achieved complete cytogenetic response CCyR including 146 87 with major molecular response MMR complete in 46 patients 28 According to the ELN definitions the rates of suboptimal response were 0 2 1 and 12 at 3 6 12 and 18 months of therapy respectively There was no difference in EFS and CCyR duration between patients who achieved CCyR with and without MMR across all the landmark times of 3 6 12 and 18 months The use of second-generation TKIs as initial therapy in CML induces high rates of CCyR at early time points The ELN definitions of response proposed for imatinib therapy are not applicable in this setting We propose that achievement of CCyR and partial cytogenetic response at 3 months should be considered optimal and suboptimal responses respectively The achievement of MMR offered no advantage over CCyR in defining long-term outcome in patients with newly diagnosed CML treated with second-generation TKIs,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 51, 3833, 1587, 20, 3, 1865, 10631, 9217, 32, 395, 23, 3, 877, 1, 577, 3007, 328, 36, 192, 16, 860, 317, 46, 3833, 4930, 6, 7, 73, 5, 419, 914, 564, 216, 222, 1671, 104, 1128, 1746, 648, 7, 5, 732, 265, 442, 2194, 903, 4, 442, 124, 11, 73, 5, 419, 914, 1671, 4, 124, 215, 143, 2638, 865, 1674, 868, 52, 166, 126, 10, 466, 53, 774, 115, 25, 1683, 10, 644, 29, 3, 2435, 1, 24, 6, 3, 1244, 1, 407, 1, 236, 813, 51, 407, 1, 236, 15, 458, 1266, 51, 2007, 1, 36, 9, 155, 15, 926, 1, 209, 91, 6, 2241, 15, 6529, 3523, 15, 273, 28, 500, 98, 63, 3735, 7, 966, 513, 236, 1266, 51, 6412, 141, 4909, 912, 5, 458, 219, 51, 2205, 236, 4, 641, 7, 339, 768, 6, 3, 9217, 3833, 3, 151, 1, 3291, 51, 11, 13, 18, 14, 2, 133, 28, 27, 49, 133, 2, 203, 53, 1, 36, 106, 125, 10, 77, 523, 4, 1683, 2, 6412, 654, 59, 7, 54, 513, 6412, 5, 2, 187, 2205, 716, 62, 3, 3829, 1072, 1, 27, 49, 133, 2, 203, 53, 3, 119, 1, 419, 914, 1671, 22, 388, 36, 4, 903, 1516, 64, 151, 1, 6412, 28, 191, 98, 862, 3, 9217, 3833, 1, 51, 1587, 9, 577, 36, 32, 44, 3801, 4, 26, 546, 21, 2548, 17, 5088, 1, 6412, 2, 450, 1266, 51, 28, 27, 53, 257, 40, 515, 665, 2, 3291, 253, 106, 3, 5088, 1, 2205, 2216, 77, 1874, 252, 6412, 4, 2847, 319, 337, 228, 4, 7, 5, 732, 265, 903, 73, 5, 419, 914, 1671]",1692.0,21990394,48
Pigmentary changes in a patient treated with imatinib.,Journal of drugs in dermatology : JDD,J Drugs Dermatol,2011-09-01,"Imatinib mesylate (STI 571; Gleevec; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland) is an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets a constitutively activated BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase with additional inhibitory effects on platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors alpha and beta, and KIT. It has revolutionized the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and is also FDA-approved for KIT-positive advanced gastrointestinal tumor (GIST) and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. A wide spectrum of dermatologic toxicities has been associated with this agent, among which a maculopapular rash is the most common event.

"How to choose frontline therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia: so many drugs, not so many patients.",Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,2012-01-01,"With the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the management and outlook for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) have completely changed over the past 10 years. Imatinib was the first TKI approved to treat CML in the chronic phase. After their initial approval as second-line agents, dasatinib and nilotinib were compared with imatinib in the first-line setting in 2 randomized trials. Both trials showed that therapeutic milestones (complete cytogenetic remission and major molecular remission) occurred earlier with these newer agents, leading to their approval for the treatment of newly diagnosed CML. Therefore, 3 different TKIs are now available for treating CML. Long-term follow-up of patients treated with imatinib shows that the attainment of therapeutic milestones by 12 months of therapy leads to better long-term outcomes. Most patients who experience disease progression on imatinib do so within the first 3 years of therapy. Therefore, one can argue that dasatinib or nilotinib should be chosen to treat patients with newly diagnosed CML. However, these agents do not have the long-term track record of imatinib.

Underreporting of myeloid malignancies by United States cancer registries.,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev.,2012-01-11,"The recent decrease in myeloid leukemia incidence may be directly attributed to changes in the population-based cancer registries 2001 guidelines, which required the capture of only one malignancy in the myeloid lineage per person and the simultaneous adoption of myelodysplastic syndrome registration in the United States. We constructed four claims-based algorithms to assess myeloid leukemia incidence, applied the algorithms to the 1999-2008 Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database, and assessed algorithm validity using SEER-registered cases. Each had moderate sensitivities (75%-94%) and high specificities (>99.0%), with the 2+BCBM algorithm showing the highest specificity. On the basis of the 2+BCBM algorithm, SEER registered only 50% of the acute myelogenous leukemia cases and a third of the chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cases. The annual incidence of myeloid leukemia in 2005 was 26 per 100,000 persons 66 years or older, much higher than the 15 per 100,000 reported by SEER using the same sample.

Phase I trial of the combination of flavopiridol and imatinib mesylate in patients with Bcr-Abl+ hematological malignancies.,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol.,2012-02-15,"Imatinib is an inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase; however, resistance is common. Flavopiridol, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, down-regulates short-lived anti-apoptotic proteins via inhibition of transcription. In preclinical studies, flavopiridol synergizes with imatinib to induce apoptosis. We investigated this novel combination regimen in patients with Bcr-Abl(+) malignancies. In a phase I dose-escalation study, imatinib was administered orally daily, and flavopiridol by 1 h intravenous infusion weekly for 3 weeks every 4 weeks. Adults with chronic myelogenous leukemia or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute leukemia were eligible. Patients were divided into two strata based on peripheral blood and bone marrow blast counts. The primary objective was to identify the recommended phase II doses for the combination. Correlative pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were also performed. A total of 21 patients received study treatment. Four dose levels were evaluated before the study was closed following the approval of the second-generation Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Five patients responded, including four sustained responses. Four patients had stable disease. All but one responder, and all patients with stable disease had previously been treated with imatinib. One patient had a complete response sustained for 30 months. Changes in expression of phospho-Bcr/Abl, -Stat5, and Mcl-1 were monitored. No major pharmacokinetic interaction was observed. This is the first study to evaluate the combination of a CDK inhibitor and a TKI in humans.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia stem and progenitor cells demonstrate chromosomal instability related to repeated breakage-fusion-bridge cycles mediated by increased nonhomologous end joining.,Blood,Blood,2012-04-04,"Chromosomal aberrations are an important consequence of genotoxic exposure and contribute to pathogenesis and progression of several malignancies. We investigated the susceptibility to chromosomal aberrations in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) progenitors after exposure to ionizing radiation. In normal progenitors, ionizing radiation induced both stable and unstable chromosomal lesions, but only stable aberrations persisted after multiple divisions. In contrast, radiation of chronic phase CML progenitors resulted in enhanced generation of unstable lesions that persisted after multiple divisions. CML progenitors demonstrated active cell cycle checkpoints and increased nonhomologous end joining DNA repair, suggesting that persistence of unstable aberrations was the result of continued generation of these lesions.

Cancers predispose neutrophils to release extracellular DNA traps that contribute to cancer-associated thrombosis.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2012-07-23,"Cancer-associated thrombosis often lacks a clear etiology. However, it is linked to a poor prognosis and represents the second-leading cause of death in cancer patients. Recent studies have shown that chromatin released into blood, through the generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), is procoagulant and prothrombotic. Using a murine model of chronic myelogenous leukemia, we show that malignant and nonmalignant neutrophils are more prone to NET formation. This increased sensitivity toward NET generation is also observed in mammary and lung carcinoma models, suggesting that cancers, through a systemic effect on the host, can induce an increase in peripheral blood neutrophils, which are predisposed to NET formation. In addition, in the late stages of the breast carcinoma model, NETosis occurs concomitant with the appearance of venous thrombi in the lung. Moreover, simulation of a minor systemic infection in tumor-bearing, but not control, mice results in the release of large quantities of chromatin and a prothrombotic state. The increase in neutrophil count and their priming is mediated by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which accumulates in the blood of tumor-bearing mice. The prothrombotic state in cancer can be reproduced by treating mice with G-CSF combined with low-dose LPS and leads to thrombocytopenia and microthrombosis. Taken together, our results identify extracellular chromatin released through NET formation as a cause for cancer-associated thrombosis and unveil a target in the effort to decrease the incidence of thrombosis in cancer patients.",Journal Article,2738.0,318.0,Cancer-associated thrombosis often lacks a clear etiology However it is linked to a poor prognosis and represents the second-leading cause of death in cancer patients Recent studies have shown that chromatin released into blood through the generation of neutrophil extracellular traps NETs is procoagulant and prothrombotic Using a murine model of chronic myelogenous we show that malignant and nonmalignant neutrophils are more prone to NET formation This increased sensitivity toward NET generation is also observed in mammary and carcinoma models suggesting that cancers through a systemic effect on the host can induce an increase in peripheral blood neutrophils which are predisposed to NET formation In addition in the late stages of the carcinoma model NETosis occurs concomitant with the appearance of venous thrombi in the Moreover simulation of a minor systemic infection in tumor-bearing but not control mice results in the release of large quantities of chromatin and a prothrombotic state The increase in neutrophil count and their priming is mediated by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor G-CSF which accumulates in the blood of tumor-bearing mice The prothrombotic state in cancer can be reproduced by treating mice with G-CSF combined with low-dose LPS and leads to thrombocytopenia and microthrombosis Taken together our results identify extracellular chromatin released through NET formation as a cause for cancer-associated thrombosis and unveil a target in the effort to decrease the incidence of thrombosis in cancer patients,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[12, 41, 2839, 629, 6856, 8, 885, 2855, 137, 192, 16, 1199, 6, 8, 334, 356, 2, 1449, 3, 419, 1049, 708, 1, 273, 4, 12, 7, 435, 94, 47, 443, 17, 2287, 5394, 237, 315, 298, 3, 914, 1, 2595, 1976, 23997, 2883, 16, 21284, 2, 23142, 75, 8, 1471, 202, 1, 442, 2194, 21, 514, 17, 393, 2, 5967, 5700, 32, 80, 7104, 6, 2587, 1264, 26, 101, 485, 1317, 2587, 914, 16, 120, 164, 4, 1903, 2, 134, 274, 802, 17, 163, 298, 8, 403, 254, 23, 3, 1204, 122, 1290, 35, 344, 4, 672, 315, 5700, 92, 32, 11072, 6, 2587, 1264, 4, 352, 4, 3, 807, 1153, 1, 3, 134, 202, 61693, 1780, 1781, 5, 3, 3592, 1, 2167, 13622, 4, 3, 1393, 4026, 1, 8, 2278, 403, 930, 4, 30, 1894, 84, 44, 182, 399, 99, 4, 3, 2008, 1, 375, 11972, 1, 2287, 2, 8, 23142, 1309, 3, 344, 4, 2595, 1276, 2, 136, 4903, 16, 517, 20, 2764, 1975, 2122, 161, 499, 1211, 92, 14390, 4, 3, 315, 1, 30, 1894, 399, 3, 23142, 1309, 4, 12, 122, 40, 14538, 20, 1367, 399, 5, 499, 1211, 397, 5, 154, 61, 6310, 2, 1940, 6, 1340, 2, 61694, 1633, 1162, 114, 99, 255, 1976, 2287, 5394, 298, 2587, 1264, 22, 8, 708, 9, 12, 41, 2839, 2, 16019, 8, 283, 4, 3, 2919, 6, 775, 3, 287, 1, 2839, 4, 12, 7]",1549.0,22826226,9

Digital image analysis as a tool to assess the effects of imatinib on trabecular bone in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2012-08-29,"Skeletal integrity is sustained by osteoblast-osteoclast interactions, controlled by several signaling pathways that include tyrosine kinases. Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with an extended therapeutic range based on its ability to differentially bind to receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. In this study, we used digital image analysis to assess changes in trabecular bone surface area within bone marrow biopsy specimens of 34 patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with single-agent imatinib. These patients were 25 men and 9 women with a median age of 59 years. We selected representative areas of paired bone marrow biopsy specimens obtained at baseline and within the subsequent 48 months. Computer-assisted analysis was performed to calculate trabecular bone area (TBA) within the sample by using the equation TBA% = sum of trabecular area/total biopsy specimen area. Percentage changes were defined as ΔTBA% and were arbitrarily subdivided into marked (>50%), moderate (10%-50%), and mild (<10%).

Novel cellular therapies for leukemia: CAR-modified T cells targeted to the CD19 antigen.,Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,2012-01-01,"The ability of immune-competent donor T cells to mediate a beneficial graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect was first identified in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for hematologic malignancies. Unfortunately, with the exception of chronic myelogenous leukemia and EBV-induced lymphoproliferative disease, allo-HSCT GVL lacks the potency to significantly affect disease progression or recurrence in most other hematologic malignancies. The inadequacy of a GVL effect using past approaches is particularly evident in patients with lymphoid malignancies. However, with the advent of improved gene transfer technology, genetically modified tumor-specific immune effectors have extended cellular immunotherapy to lymphoid malignancies. One promising strategy entails the introduction of genes encoding artificial receptors called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), which redirect the specificity and function of immune effectors. CAR-modified T cells targeted to the B cell-specific CD19 antigen have demonstrated promising results in multiple early clinical trials, supporting further investigation in patients with B-cell cancers. However, disparities in clinical trial design and CAR structure have complicated the discovery of the optimal application of this technology.

The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has dramatically improved survival time for many CML patients. Current first-line treatment options include imatinib and the second-generation agents nilotinib and dasatinib. Second- and third-line agents include nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and the new agent ponatinib. Despite the effectiveness of TKIs, some patients develop resistance or intolerance to these agents. A number of mutations of the BCR-ABL gene have been identified and are associated with TKI resistance. Patients may benefit from switching to a second-line TKI, undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant, or receiving newly emerging agents. Although early response is associated with improved patient outcome, clinicians lack tests that can determine which patients will benefit from which therapies.

Comparing nilotinib with dasatinib as second-line therapies in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia resistant or intolerant to imatinib -- a retrospective chart review analysis.,Current medical research and opinion,Curr Med Res Opin,2013-04-08,"This study compared progression, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and treatment changes among chronic myelogenous leukemia patients in chronic phase (CML-CP) receiving nilotinib or dasatinib as second-line therapy. Information on CML-CP patients switched from imatinib to nilotinib or dasatinib as second-line therapy was collected retrospectively from 122 US hematologists and oncologists through an online medical chart review. Progression, PFS, and OS were compared using multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, and treatment changes using chi-square tests. Of 597 imatinib resistant or intolerant patients, 301 initiated nilotinib and 296 dasatinib as second-line therapy. Nilotinib was associated with a lower risk of progression (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.27; p = 0.021) and longer PFS (HR = 0.48; p = 0.030) than dasatinib, with a median follow-up time of 11 months for nilotinib and 10 months for dasatinib. Nilotinib patients had a lower estimated hazard of mortality than dasatinib patients, though not statistically significant (HR = 0.46; p = 0.067). When treatment changes were classified by the physicians' justifications, fewer nilotinib patients had treatment changes due to ineffectiveness (2.0% vs. 5.1%, p = 0.041) or drug holidays due to intolerance (0.0% vs. 1.7%, p = 0.024) than dasatinib patients. Among CML-CP patients in this retrospective chart review who switched from imatinib to either nilotinib or dasatinib, nilotinib was associated with a significantly lower risk of progression and longer PFS than dasatinib. Nilotinib patients were also less likely than dasatinib patients to subsequently have treatment changes due to ineffectiveness or drug holidays due to intolerance.

Adherence to targeted oral anticancer medications.,Discovery medicine,Discov Med,2013-04-01,"The use of targeted oral anticancer medications (OAMs) is becoming increasingly prevalent in cancer care. Approximately 25-30% of the oncology drug pipeline involves oral agents and there are now over 50 OAMs approved by the Food and Drug Administration. This change represents a major shift in management of patients with cancer from directly observed, intermittent intravenous therapy to self-administered, oral chronic therapy. The increased prevalence of OAMs raises the issue of adherence in oncology, including understanding the challenges of adherence to OAMs. This review focuses on studies of adherence for patients taking molecularly targeted OAMs for breast cancer, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

Outcomes in patients age 70 or older undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for hematologic malignancies.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2013-06-18,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can achieve durable remissions in a number of patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. Little is known about the safety of HSCT in patients age 70 or older. Consecutive patients (n = 54) age 70 or older underwent HSCT between 2007 and 2012. Diseases included acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 25), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 12), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 5), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 4), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 3), myeloproliferative neoplasm (n = 4), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 1). Median follow-up for survivors was 21 months. All patients received reduced-intensity conditioning regimens, primarily busulfan/fludarabine. All patients received unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cell grafts: 44 from 8/8 matched unrelated donors, 8 from matched related donors, and 2 from 7/8 matched unrelated donors. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was calcineurin inhibitor-based in all patients. The median age at transplantation was 71 years (range, 70 to 76); the median HCT comorbidity index score was 1 (range, 0 to 5). Two patients died before hematopoietic recovery (1 with graft failure and 1 with disease progression), and 1 patient relapsed before hematopoietic recovery; otherwise, all engrafted with median donor chimerism of 94% at 1 month. Cumulative incidence of grades II to IV acute GVHD was 13% and of grades III to IV acute GVHD, 9.3%. At 2 years, the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 36%, progression-free survival was 39%, overall survival was 39%, and relapse was 56%.

KIT signaling governs differential sensitivity of mature and primitive CML progenitors to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2013-07-25,"Imatinib and other BCR-ABL1 inhibitors are effective therapies for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), but these inhibitors target additional kinases including KIT, raising the question of whether off-target effects contribute to clinical efficacy. On the basis of its involvement in CML pathogenesis, we hypothesized that KIT may govern responses of CML cells to imatinib. To test this, we assessed the growth of primary CML progenitor cells under conditions of sole BCR-ABL1, sole KIT, and dual BCR-ABL1/KIT inhibition. Sole BCR-ABL1 inhibition suppressed mature CML progenitor cells, but these effects were largely abolished by stem cell factor (SCF) and maximal suppression required dual BCR-ABL1/KIT inhibition. In contrast, KIT inhibition did not add to the effects of BCR-ABL1 inhibition in primitive progenitors, represented by CD34(+)38(-) cells. Long-term culture-initiating cell assays on murine stroma revealed profound depletion of primitive CML cells by sole BCR-ABL1 inhibition despite the presence of SCF, suggesting that primitive CML cells are unable to use SCF as a survival factor upon BCR-ABL1 inhibition.

Differential regulation of myeloid leukemias by the bone marrow microenvironment.,Nature medicine,Nat. Med.,2013-10-27,"Like their normal hematopoietic stem cell counterparts, leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are presumed to reside in specific niches in the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) and may be the cause of relapse following chemotherapy. Targeting the niche is a new strategy to eliminate persistent and drug-resistant LSCs. CD44 (refs. 3,4) and interleukin-6 (ref. 5) have been implicated previously in the LSC niche. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is released during bone remodeling and plays a part in maintenance of CML LSCs, but a role for TGF-β1 from the BMM has not been defined. Here, we show that alteration of the BMM by osteoblastic cell-specific activation of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptor attenuates BCR-ABL1 oncogene-induced CML-like myeloproliferative neoplasia (MPN) but enhances MLL-AF9 oncogene-induced AML in mouse transplantation models, possibly through opposing effects of increased TGF-β1 on the respective LSCs. PTH treatment caused a 15-fold decrease in LSCs in wild-type mice with CML-like MPN and reduced engraftment of immune-deficient mice with primary human CML cells. These results demonstrate that LSC niches in CML and AML are distinct and suggest that modulation of the BMM by PTH may be a feasible strategy to reduce LSCs, a prerequisite for the cure of CML.

Reversal of in situ T-cell exhaustion during effective human antileukemia responses to donor lymphocyte infusion.,Blood,Blood,2013-12-19,"Increasing evidence across malignancies suggests that infiltrating T cells at the site of disease are crucial to tumor control. We hypothesized that marrow-infiltrating immune populations play a critical role in response to donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), an established and potentially curative immune therapy whose precise mechanism remains unknown. We therefore analyzed marrow-infiltrating immune populations in 29 patients (22 responders, 7 nonresponders) with relapsed chronic myelogenous leukemia who received CD4(+) DLI in the pre-tyrosine kinase inhibitor era. Immunohistochemical analysis of pretreatment marrow revealed that the presence of >4% marrow-infiltrating CD8(+) (but not CD4(+)) T cells predicted DLI response, even in the setting of high leukemia burden. Furthermore, mRNA expression profiling of marrow-infiltrating T cells of a subset of responders compared with nonresponders revealed enrichment of T-cell exhaustion-specific genes in pretreatment T cells of DLI responders and significant downregulation of gene components in the same pathway in responders in conjunction with clinical response. Our data demonstrate that response to DLI is associated with quantity of preexisting marrow CD8(+) T cells and local reversal of T-cell exhaustion.

Discovery of imatinib-responsive FIP1L1-PDGFRA mutation during refractory acute myeloid leukemia transformation of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.,Journal of hematology & oncology,J Hematol Oncol,2014-03-27,"The FIP1L1-PDGFRA rearrangement results in constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase PDGFRA. Neoplasms harboring this rearrangement are responsive to imatinib mesylate at doses much lower than those recommended for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Only a single report has described the identification of FIP1L1-PDGFRA in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Herein, we present a case report of a patient in whom the FIP1L1-PDGFRA was discovered as he evolved from CMML to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Toxic tacrolimus levels after application of topical tacrolimus and use of occlusive dressings in two bone marrow transplant recipients with cutaneous graft-versus-host disease.,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,2014-04-03,"Tacrolimus, a macrolide immunosuppressant, is used topically for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) for rapid, symptomatic relief of pruritus and erythema. Despite the manufacturer's product information reporting minimal systemic effects of topical tacrolimus, this has not been evaluated in patients with cutaneous GVHD and with occlusive dressings. We describe two patients with cutaneous GVHD who developed toxic tacrolimus levels after receiving several applications of tacrolimus ointment along with occlusive dressings to enhance skin effectiveness. The first patient was a 62-year-old woman with a history of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and developed chronic GVHD involving 70% of her body surface area. Her GVHD treatment plan consisted of oral corticosteroids, oral tacrolimus, topical corticosteroids, topical tacrolimus 0.1% ointment twice/day, emollient creams, intravenous rituximab, and photopheresis. The patient's tacrolimus trough levels rose rapidly over the course of 6 days from less than 2 ng/ml to 23 ng/ml, despite oral tacrolimus dosage adjustments. The second patient was a 25-year-old man who developed severe, chronic skin GVHD after undergoing allogeneic sibling bone marrow transplantation for AML. In addition to intravenous corticosteroids, corticosteroid creams, and oral tacrolimus, the patient also received topical tacrolimus twice/day with occlusive dressings. Over the course of 2 days, his tacrolimus trough levels increased from 7.10 ng/ml to 22.10 ng/ml. Although improvement was noted in both patients' skin GVHD with application of the occlusive dressings, the practice was discontinued due to increased and erratic systemic tacrolimus absorption. These case reports suggest that substantial use of topical tacrolimus with occlusive dressings in patients with cutaneous GVHD may contribute to increased systemic absorption resulting in toxic tacrolimus levels. Based on the findings from our two patients as well as published case reports, systemic absorption appears to increase with greater skin permeability, skin barrier dysfunction, amount of body surface area applied, and use of occlusive dressings. When one or more of these factors are present, it may be prudent to monitor tacrolimus levels.",Case Reports,2119.0,9.0,Tacrolimus a macrolide immunosuppressant is used topically for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations of graft-versus-host disease GVHD for rapid symptomatic relief of pruritus and erythema Despite the manufacturer 's product information reporting minimal systemic effects of topical tacrolimus this has not been evaluated in patients with cutaneous GVHD and with occlusive dressings We describe two patients with cutaneous GVHD who developed toxic tacrolimus levels after receiving several applications of tacrolimus ointment along with occlusive dressings to enhance effectiveness The first patient was a 62-year-old woman with a history of acute myelogenous AML who underwent allogeneic marrow transplantation and developed chronic GVHD involving 70 of her body surface area Her GVHD treatment plan consisted of oral corticosteroids oral tacrolimus topical corticosteroids topical tacrolimus 0.1 ointment twice/day emollient creams intravenous rituximab and photopheresis The patient 's tacrolimus trough levels rose rapidly over the course of 6 days from less than 2 ng/ml to 23 ng/ml despite oral tacrolimus dosage adjustments The second patient was a 25-year-old man who developed severe chronic GVHD after undergoing allogeneic sibling marrow transplantation for AML In addition to intravenous corticosteroids corticosteroid creams and oral tacrolimus the patient also received topical tacrolimus twice/day with occlusive dressings Over the course of 2 days his tacrolimus trough levels increased from 7.10 ng/ml to 22.10 ng/ml Although improvement was noted in both patients GVHD with application of the occlusive dressings the practice was discontinued due to increased and erratic systemic tacrolimus absorption These case reports suggest that substantial use of topical tacrolimus with occlusive dressings in patients with cutaneous GVHD may contribute to increased systemic absorption resulting in toxic tacrolimus levels Based on the findings from our two patients as well as published case reports systemic absorption appears to increase with greater permeability barrier dysfunction amount of body surface area applied and use of occlusive dressings When one or more of these factors are present it may be prudent to monitor tacrolimus levels,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[5643, 8, 28247, 20343, 16, 95, 21012, 9, 3, 24, 1, 1486, 4282, 1, 1599, 185, 1204, 34, 1562, 9, 1321, 1704, 4586, 1, 6858, 2, 9167, 550, 3, 18245, 292, 2821, 487, 1760, 1048, 403, 176, 1, 5879, 5643, 26, 71, 44, 85, 194, 4, 7, 5, 1486, 1562, 2, 5, 8376, 29550, 21, 897, 100, 7, 5, 1486, 1562, 54, 276, 1812, 5643, 148, 50, 357, 392, 2911, 1, 5643, 32217, 1510, 5, 8376, 29550, 6, 1304, 1236, 3, 157, 69, 10, 8, 744, 111, 1095, 2854, 5, 8, 532, 1, 286, 2194, 329, 54, 208, 1063, 581, 497, 2, 276, 442, 1562, 1267, 431, 1, 1084, 642, 1255, 965, 1084, 1562, 24, 2242, 1695, 1, 518, 3876, 518, 5643, 5879, 3876, 5879, 5643, 13, 14, 32217, 936, 218, 37898, 48283, 1262, 855, 2, 22166, 3, 69, 292, 5643, 6000, 148, 7370, 1755, 252, 3, 906, 1, 49, 162, 29, 299, 76, 18, 997, 542, 6, 382, 997, 542, 550, 518, 5643, 3323, 6017, 3, 419, 69, 10, 8, 243, 111, 1095, 3628, 54, 276, 905, 442, 1562, 50, 479, 1063, 3684, 581, 497, 9, 329, 4, 352, 6, 1262, 3876, 5654, 48283, 2, 518, 5643, 3, 69, 120, 103, 5879, 5643, 936, 218, 5, 8376, 29550, 252, 3, 906, 1, 18, 162, 3224, 5643, 6000, 148, 101, 29, 67, 79, 997, 542, 6, 350, 79, 997, 542, 242, 767, 10, 1051, 4, 110, 7, 1562, 5, 1581, 1, 3, 8376, 29550, 3, 758, 10, 2402, 520, 6, 101, 2, 35785, 403, 5643, 6125, 46, 473, 1198, 309, 17, 1281, 119, 1, 5879, 5643, 5, 8376, 29550, 4, 7, 5, 1486, 1562, 68, 1248, 6, 101, 403, 6125, 1113, 4, 1812, 5643, 148, 90, 23, 3, 272, 29, 114, 100, 7, 22, 149, 22, 983, 473, 1198, 403, 6125, 1233, 6, 344, 5, 378, 4757, 3318, 1527, 3108, 1, 642, 1255, 965, 1498, 2, 119, 1, 8376, 29550, 198, 104, 15, 80, 1, 46, 130, 32, 364, 192, 68, 40, 10263, 6, 3334, 5643, 148]",2260.0,24700567,23

"Response monitoring, tolerability, and effectiveness of imatinib treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia in a retrospective research database.",Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,2014-08-01,"Retrospective review of imatinib monitoring through electronic health records (EHR) can provide valuable insight into the current management of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). This study retrospectively reviewed EHRs from 2001 to 2010 of patients with chronic phase CML (CP-CML) treated with first-line imatinib. Chart evaluations included a review of cytogenetic and molecular testing, overall survival, adverse drug events (ADEs), and therapy modifications. A total of 54 patients with CP-CML were treated with first-line imatinib and had either cytogenetic or molecular testing within 18 months of imatinib initiation. Within the first 18 months of treatment, 33 of 45 patients (73%) undergoing cytogenetic testing experienced a complete cytogenetic response (median, 241 days; range, 110-542 days) and 24 of 48 patients (50%) receiving molecular testing achieved at least a major molecular response (median, 253 days; range, 99-546 days). The average number of cytogenetic and molecular tests conducted within the first 18 months was 2.5 and 3.8, respectively. Nineteen of 54 (35%) had a dose increase of imatinib (>400 mg; median, 329 days; range, 21-1968 days). The 5-year estimated overall survival rate was 88.5%. Between 2006 and 2010 (n=30; 56%), 7 patients (23%) transitioned to dasatinib or nilotinib (median, 399 days from diagnosis; range, 180-1046 days) because of suboptimal response or treatment failure (n=5) and imatinib ADEs (n=2).

Nonpermissive HLA-DPB1 mismatch increases mortality after myeloablative unrelated allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.,Blood,Blood,2014-08-26,"We examined current outcomes of unrelated donor allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to determine the clinical implications of donor-recipient HLA matching.

All had high-resolution typing for HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1. Of the total (n = 8003), cases were 8/8 (n = 5449), 7/8 (n = 2071), or 6/8 (n = 483) matched. HLA mismatch (6-7/8) conferred significantly increased risk for grades II to IV and III to IV acute graft vs host disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD, transplant-related mortality (TRM), and overall mortality compared with HLA-matched cases (8/8). Type (allele/antigen) and locus (HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1) of mismatch were not associated with overall mortality. Among 8/8 matched cases, HLA-DPB1 and -DQB1 mismatch resulted in increased acute GVHD, and HLA-DPB1 mismatch had decreased relapse.

New perspectives on type I IFNs in cancer.,Cytokine & growth factor reviews,Cytokine Growth Factor Rev.,2015-01-07,"Although type I IFNs were initially described based on their anti-viral properties, it was quickly realized that these cytokines had anti-proliferative and anti-cancer activities. These observations ultimately led to the clinical development and utility of IFN-α2b for the treatment of patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and chronic myelogenous leukemia, among others. However, the mechanism of action of type I IFNs in vivo was never fully elucidated, and the pleiotropic effects of IFNs on multiple cell types had made it challenging to decipher. Advancement of genetically engineered mouse models has provided new tools for interrogating these mechanisms. Recent evidence has indicated that spontaneous innate immune sensing of cancers that leads to adaptive immune responses is dependent on host type I IFN production and signaling. The major innate immune receptor pathway that leads to type I IFN production in response to a growing tumor appears to be the STING pathway of cytosolic DNA sensing. STING agonists drive type I IFN production and are impressively therapeutic in mouse tumor models. Targeting low doses of type I IFNs to the tumor microenvironment also promotes anti-tumor activity via host adaptive immunity that is T cell-dependent. However, high doses of intratumoral type I IFNs largely function via an anti-angiogenic effect.

Which tyrosine-kinase inhibitor to use first in chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia?,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,Expert Opin Pharmacother,2015-04-03,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder distinctly characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, which results from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 [t(9;22)]. The resulting translocation leads to the development of the BCR-ABL1 oncogene, a constitutively active fusion protein, which leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis and has a clear association with driving the malignant activity of CML cells. Given that the BCR-ABL1 oncogene is a known key cause of CML, it has led to the development of numerous small molecule tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which target the specific oncogene mutation in CML. Presently, there are three FDA-approved TKI agents, imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib, for the treatment of frontline CML. Herein, we review the frontline options for the management of patients with CML and how to best choose these agents. Imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib are all effective at yielding hematological, molecular and cytogenetic responses in patients with newly diagnosed CML. Frontline therapy may depend on physician experience, patient age and ability to tolerate therapy, and with the lack of data comparing all three agents alongside each other, imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib may all be suitable frontline choices.",Journal Article,1754.0,10.0,Chronic myelogenous CML is a clonal disorder distinctly characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome which results from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 t 9 22 The resulting translocation leads to the development of the BCR-ABL1 oncogene a constitutively active fusion protein which leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis and has a clear association with driving the malignant activity of CML cells Given that the BCR-ABL1 oncogene is a known key cause of CML it has led to the development of numerous small molecule tyrosine-kinase inhibitors TKIs which target the specific oncogene mutation in CML Presently there are three FDA-approved TKI agents imatinib dasatinib and nilotinib for the treatment of frontline CML Herein we review the frontline options for the management of patients with CML and how to best choose these agents Imatinib dasatinib and nilotinib are all effective at yielding hematological molecular and cytogenetic responses in patients with newly diagnosed CML Frontline therapy may depend on physician experience patient age and ability to tolerate therapy and with the lack of data comparing all three agents alongside each other imatinib dasatinib or nilotinib may all be suitable frontline choices,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[442, 2194, 903, 16, 8, 1946, 2645, 9452, 765, 20, 3, 463, 1, 3, 3006, 1170, 92, 99, 29, 8, 8020, 2006, 59, 3560, 83, 2, 350, 102, 83, 350, 3, 1113, 2006, 1940, 6, 3, 193, 1, 3, 1062, 3557, 1836, 8, 2818, 544, 1212, 178, 92, 1940, 6, 6180, 31, 457, 2, 405, 351, 2, 71, 8, 885, 248, 5, 4057, 3, 393, 128, 1, 903, 37, 447, 17, 3, 1062, 3557, 1836, 16, 8, 440, 825, 708, 1, 903, 192, 71, 836, 6, 3, 193, 1, 2331, 302, 1354, 564, 216, 222, 1671, 92, 283, 3, 112, 1836, 258, 4, 903, 9083, 125, 32, 169, 2078, 850, 1379, 183, 577, 1674, 2, 2638, 9, 3, 24, 1, 3171, 903, 1986, 21, 206, 3, 3171, 838, 9, 3, 284, 1, 7, 5, 903, 2, 832, 6, 824, 6009, 46, 183, 577, 1674, 2, 2638, 32, 62, 323, 28, 4949, 2890, 219, 2, 1266, 253, 4, 7, 5, 732, 265, 903, 3171, 36, 68, 4533, 23, 1473, 730, 69, 89, 2, 801, 6, 5010, 36, 2, 5, 3, 926, 1, 74, 1430, 62, 169, 183, 10150, 296, 127, 577, 1674, 15, 2638, 68, 62, 40, 2884, 3171, 5218]",1286.0,25840461,89

Previous reports have suggested that in patients with relapsed CLL, a dose-intensified rituximab regimen increases response rates in comparison with standard-dose rituximab. It is unknown whether rituximab intensification of the FCR regimen will result in improved response rates and patient outcomes in patients with previously untreated CLL. A single-arm study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a modified FCR regimen with multiple-dose rituximab (FCR3) in 65 patients with previously untreated CLL. The results were compared with those for a historical cohort treated with FCR. The overall response rate to FCR3 was 97%, with 75% of the patients achieving a complete remission. Minimal residual disease negativity was achieved for 62% of the patients according to flow cytometry. The median time to progression (TTP) was 81 months, and the median overall survival (OS) was not reached, with 58% of the patients still alive at a median survivor follow-up of 9.7 years.

Apher. Sci.,2015-07-14,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) complicating pregnancy is uncommon. Literature search demonstrates only a few case reports and some case series but large studies are lacking due to its uncommon presentation. Management of these patients is particularly challenging due to limited available options as several chemotherapy drugs could potentially lead to adverse outcomes and fetal malformations. Leukapheresis has been used in these situations; however paucity of data exists regarding the outcome and complications associated with the procedure.

High Disease-Free Survival with Enhanced Protection against Relapse after Double-Unit Cord Blood Transplantation When Compared with T Cell-Depleted Unrelated Donor Transplantation in Patients with Acute Leukemia and Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2015-07-31,"Double-unit cord blood (DCB) grafts are a rapidly available stem cell source for adults with high-risk leukemias. However, how disease-free survival (DFS) after DCB transplantation (DCBT) compares to that of unrelated donor transplantation (URDT) is not fully established. We analyzed 166 allograft recipients (66 8/8 HLA-matched URDT, 45 7/8 HLA-matched URDT, and 55 DCBT) ages 16 to 60 years with high-risk acute leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). URDT and DCBT recipients were similar except DCBT recipients were more likely to have lower weight and non-European ancestry and to receive intermediate-intensity conditioning. All URDT recipients received a CD34(+) cell-selected (T cell-depleted) graft. Overall, differences between the 3-year transplantation-related mortality were not significant (8/8 URDT, 18%; 7/8 URDT, 39%; and DCBT, 24%; P = .108), whereas the 3-year relapse risk was decreased after DCBT (8/8 URDT, 23%; 7/8 URDT, 20%; and DCBT 9%, P = .037). Three-year DFS was 57% in 8/8 URDT, 41% in 7/8 URDT, and 68% in DCBT recipients (P = .068), and the 3-year DFS in DCBT recipients was higher than that of 7/8 URDT recipients (P = .021). In multivariate analysis in acute leukemia patients, factors adversely associated with DFS were female gender (hazard ratio [HR], 1.68; P = .031), diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (HR, 2.09; P = .004), and 7/8 T cell-depleted URDT (HR, 1.91; P = .037). High DFS can be achieved in adults with acute leukemia and CML with low relapse rates after DCBT. Our findings support performing DCBT in adults in preference to HLA-mismatched T cell-depleted URDT and suggest DCBT is a readily available alternative to T cell-depleted 8/8 URDT, especially in patients requiring urgent transplantation.

Clinical and prognostic significance of 3q26.2 and other chromosome 3 abnormalities in CML in the era of tyrosine kinase inhibitors.,Blood,Blood,2015-08-04,"Chromosome 3q26.2 abnormalities in acute myeloid leukemia, including inv(3)/t(3;3) and t(3;21), have been studied and are associated with a poor prognosis. Their prevalence, response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment, and prognostic significance in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) are largely unknown. In this study, we explored these aspects using a cohort of 2013 patients with CML diagnosed in the era of TKI therapy. Chromosome 3 abnormalities were observed in 116 (5.8%) of 2013 cases. These cases were divided into 5 distinct groups: A, inv(3)(q21q26.2)/t(3;3)(q21;q26.2), 26%; B, t(3;21)(q26.2;q22), 17%; C, other 3q26.2 rearrangements, 7%; D, rearrangements involving chromosome 3 other than 3q26.2 locus, 32%; and E, gain or loss of partial or whole chromosome 3, 18%. In all, 3q26.2 rearrangements were the most common chromosome 3 abnormalities (50%, groups A-C). 3q26.2 rearrangements emerged at different leukemic phases. For cases with 3q26.2 rearrangements that initially emerged in chronic or accelerated phase, they had a high rate of transformation to blast phase. Patients with 3q26.2 abnormalities showed a marginal response to TKI treatment, and no patients achieved a long-term sustainable response at a cytogenetic or molecular level. Compared with other chromosomal abnormalities in CML, patients with 3q26.2 rearrangements had poorer overall survival. The presence or absence of other concurrent chromosomal abnormalities did not affect survival in these patients, reflecting the predominant role of 3q26.2 rearrangements in determining prognosis. Interestingly, although heterogeneous, chromosome 3 abnormalities involving non-3q26.2 loci (groups D, E) also conferred a worse prognosis compared with changes involving other chromosomes in this cohort.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors as a first-line treatment in patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase: A mixed-treatment comparison.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2015-10-28,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are the initial treatment for majority of newly diagnosed patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP) and are associated with marked improvement in hematological, cytogenetic, molecular response and survival rates compared with other therapies. In this review, we summarize the evidence of TKI efficacy for patients with newly diagnosed CP-CML. Six trials at low risk of bias evaluating TKIs as an initial treatment in adults with newly diagnosed CP-CML and enrolling 2,456 patients were included. Follow-up times ranged from a median of 3 months to 5 years. Direct comparison showed statistically higher rates of major molecular response (MMR ≤ 0.1%(IS)) achievement with second-generation TKIs at 12 months which was sustained throughout treatment period. Bayesian mixed-treatment comparison (MTC) analysis demonstrated superiority of both nilotinib and dasatinib over imatinib in terms of efficacy. Nilotinib was associated with higher deeper molecular responses (MR(4.5) ≤ 0.0032%(IS)) at 60 months than dasatinib but no difference in MMR. The differences between nilotinib and dasatinib are likely clinically trivial. Among TKIs, nilotinib was found to have the best survival profile. Both nilotinib and dasatinib are associated with significantly better MMR compared to imatinib that is sustained over 60 months. This analysis shows that new-generation TKIs are not only showing faster response but also maintaining a more potent one through longer follow-up period.

"Results of the Phase I Trial of RG7112, a Small-Molecule MDM2 Antagonist in Leukemia.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2015-10-12,"RG7112 is a small-molecule MDM2 antagonist. MDM2 is a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor p53 and frequently overexpressed in leukemias. Thus, a phase I study of RG7112 in patients with hematologic malignancies was conducted. Primary study objectives included determination of the dose and safety profile of RG7112. Secondary objectives included evaluation of pharmacokinetics; pharmacodynamics, such as TP53-mutation status and MDM2 expression; and preliminary clinical activity. Patients were divided into two cohorts: Stratum A [relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML; except acute promyelocytic leukemia), acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic myelogenous leukemia] and Stratum B (relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small cell lymphocytic leukemia; CLL/sCLL). Some Stratum A patients were treated at the MTD to assess clinical activity. RG7112 was administered to 116 patients (96 patients in Stratum A and 20 patients in Stratum B). All patients experienced at least 1 adverse event, and 3 dose-limiting toxicities were reported. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that twice-daily dosing enhanced daily exposure. Antileukemia activity was observed in the 30 patients with AML assessed at the MTD, including 5 patients who met International Working Group (IWG) criteria for response. Exploratory analysis revealed TP53 mutations in 14% of Stratum A patients and in 40% of Stratum B patients. Two patients with TP53 mutations exhibited clinical activity. p53 target genes were induced only in TP53 wild-type leukemic cells. Baseline expression levels of MDM2 correlated positively with clinical response. RG7112 demonstrated clinical activity against relapsed/refractory AML and CLL/sCLL. MDM2 inhibition resulted in p53 stabilization and transcriptional activation of p53-target genes. We provide proof-of-concept that MDM2 inhibition restores p53 function and generates clinical responses in hematologic malignancies.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",1562.0,93.0,RG7112 is a small-molecule MDM2 antagonist MDM2 is a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor p53 and frequently overexpressed in leukemias Thus a phase I study of RG7112 in patients with hematologic malignancies was conducted Primary study objectives included determination of the dose and safety profile of RG7112 Secondary objectives included evaluation of pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics such as TP53-mutation status and MDM2 expression and preliminary clinical activity Patients were divided into two cohorts Stratum A relapsed/refractory acute myeloid AML except acute promyelocytic acute lymphoblastic and chronic myelogenous and Stratum B relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small cell lymphocytic CLL/sCLL Some Stratum A patients were treated at the MTD to assess clinical activity RG7112 was administered to 116 patients 96 patients in Stratum A and 20 patients in Stratum B All patients experienced at least 1 adverse event and 3 dose-limiting toxicities were reported Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that twice-daily dosing enhanced daily exposure Antileukemia activity was observed in the 30 patients with AML assessed at the MTD including 5 patients who met International Working Group IWG criteria for response Exploratory analysis revealed TP53 mutations in 14 of Stratum A patients and in 40 of Stratum B patients Two patients with TP53 mutations exhibited clinical activity p53 target genes were induced only in TP53 wild-type leukemic cells Baseline expression levels of MDM2 correlated positively with clinical response RG7112 demonstrated clinical activity against relapsed/refractory AML and CLL/sCLL MDM2 inhibition resulted in p53 stabilization and transcriptional activation of p53-target genes We provide proof-of-concept that MDM2 inhibition restores p53 function and generates clinical responses in hematologic malignancies,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[22908, 16, 8, 302, 1354, 3277, 3137, 3277, 16, 8, 199, 2452, 1, 3, 30, 1245, 624, 2, 746, 1711, 4, 2792, 631, 8, 124, 70, 45, 1, 22908, 4, 7, 5, 813, 441, 10, 426, 86, 45, 2409, 159, 3104, 1, 3, 61, 2, 367, 800, 1, 22908, 568, 2409, 159, 451, 1, 1159, 3587, 225, 22, 1206, 258, 156, 2, 3277, 55, 2, 1676, 38, 128, 7, 11, 2176, 237, 100, 736, 4897, 8, 591, 430, 286, 533, 329, 2187, 286, 4300, 286, 1275, 2, 442, 2194, 2, 4897, 132, 591, 430, 442, 1193, 2647, 302, 31, 1193, 552, 49333, 476, 4897, 8, 7, 11, 73, 28, 3, 961, 6, 423, 38, 128, 22908, 10, 468, 6, 3790, 7, 921, 7, 4, 4897, 8, 2, 179, 7, 4, 4897, 132, 62, 7, 592, 28, 506, 14, 290, 774, 2, 27, 61, 817, 385, 11, 210, 1456, 65, 1103, 17, 936, 391, 1280, 651, 391, 645, 9169, 128, 10, 164, 4, 3, 201, 7, 5, 329, 275, 28, 3, 961, 141, 33, 7, 54, 543, 944, 2644, 87, 14620, 371, 9, 51, 2386, 65, 553, 1206, 138, 4, 213, 1, 4897, 8, 7, 2, 4, 327, 1, 4897, 132, 7, 100, 7, 5, 1206, 138, 1416, 38, 128, 624, 283, 214, 11, 277, 158, 4, 1206, 955, 267, 2015, 37, 330, 55, 148, 1, 3277, 438, 2375, 5, 38, 51, 22908, 264, 38, 128, 480, 591, 430, 329, 2, 552, 49333, 3277, 297, 627, 4, 624, 3184, 2, 1431, 363, 1, 624, 283, 214, 21, 377, 3840, 1, 2545, 17, 3277, 297, 8489, 624, 343, 2, 7919, 38, 253, 4, 813, 441]",1871.0,26459177,126
Impact of Genetic Mutations and Health Plan Access to Therapies on Treatment Response and Drug Costs Related to Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Treatment Among Patients With Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia.,American journal of clinical oncology,Am. J. Clin. Oncol.,2018-03-01,"This study assessed treatment responses and economic consequences of limiting access to the second-generation BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (2G-TKI), dasatinib and nilotinib, for treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, while taking into account frequencies of genetic mutations that exhibit different sensitivities to the 2G-TKIs. Frequencies of BCR-ABL1 mutations and the impact of mutations on responses to 2G-TKIs were obtained from published literature and used as inputs in a decision analytics model. Complete hematologic response (CHR) and major cytogenetic response (MCyR) were estimated after 12 months of 2G-TKI treatment. Total annual 2G-TKI drug costs per CHR and MCyR were estimated and compared among 3 2G-TKI access scenarios: (1) open access to both 2G-TKIs; (2) access restricted to dasatinib (DASA-only); and (3) access restricted to nilotinib (NILO-only). Among a hypothetical cohort of 1000 2G-TKI-treated chronic myelogenous leukemia patients, the percentage of patients with CHR and MCyR were greatest for the open access plan (CHR: 93%, MCyR: 56%), followed by DASA-only (88%, 53%) and NILO-only (67%, 47%). Compared with the 2G-TKI costs per CHR in open access ($120,706/CHR), the costs were 5% higher ($126,753/CHR) in DASA-only and 41% higher ($169,990/CHR) in NILO-only. Likewise, compared with the 2G-TKI costs per MCyR in open access ($198,284/MCyR), the costs were 6% higher ($209,259/MCyR) in DASA-only and 22% higher ($241,515/MCyR) in NILO-only.

Use of Real-World Claim Databases to Assess Prevalence of Comorbid Conditions Relevant to the Treatment of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Based on National Comprehensive Network Treatment Guidelines.,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2015-09-30,"The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines state that based on toxicity profiles, 1 second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) indicated for first-line therapy (ie, dasatinib, nilotinib) may be preferred over the other for treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients with certain comorbidities. This study assessed the prevalence of comorbid conditions relevant to TKI treatment choice among CML patients in the US real-world setting. Patients who had CML and initiated TKI treatment were identified from the MarketScan Commercial and Medicare databases (January 1, 2006, to June 30, 2013). Demographics and prevalence of comorbid conditions relevant to TKI treatment choice per NCCN guidelines (heart disease, arrhythmia, diabetes, pancreatitis, pleural effusion, lung disease) were assessed among the overall study population and among subgroups. The median age of the CML study population newly initiated on TKI treatment (ie, imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib; n = 2296) was 56 years. Approximately 41% of the CML study population had at least 1 comorbid condition that may influence the choice of TKI treatment as recommended by NCCN guidelines. The most prevalent comorbid condition was heart disease (23%), followed by diabetes (18%) and lung disease (13%). The prevalence of comorbid conditions relevant to TKI treatment choice varied among patients of different age groups, gender, and US regions.

Clinical Safety and Efficacy of Nilotinib or Dasatinib in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Chronic-Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia and Pre-Existing Liver and/or Renal Dysfunction.,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2015-12-18,"The safety and efficacy of front-line nilotinib and dasatinib in patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML-CP) with pre-existing liver and/or renal dysfunction are unknown. We analyzed the adverse event rates, response rates, and survival rates of 215 patients with CML-CP with or without renal and/or liver dysfunction who had been treated with front-line nilotinib (n = 108) or dasatinib (n = 107). The overall median follow-up period was 49 months. At baseline, 6 dasatinib-treated patients (6%) had mild renal dysfunction and 13 (12%) had mild liver dysfunction. Also, 8 nilotinib-treated patients (7%) had mild renal dysfunction, 1 (1%) moderate renal dysfunction, and 9 (8%) mild liver dysfunction.

Risk stratification of chromosomal abnormalities in chronic myelogenous leukemia in the era of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.,Blood,Blood,2016-03-22,"Clonal cytogenetic evolution with additional chromosomal abnormalities (ACAs) in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is generally associated with decreased response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy and adverse survival. Although ACAs are considered as a sign of disease progression and have been used as one of the criteria for accelerated phase, the differential prognostic impact of individual ACAs in CML is unknown, and a classification system to reflect such prognostic impact is lacking. In this study, we aimed to address these questions using a large cohort of CML patients treated in the era of TKIs. We focused on cases with single chromosomal changes at the time of ACA emergence and stratified the 6 most common ACAs into 2 groups: group 1 with a relatively good prognosis including trisomy 8, -Y, and an extra copy of Philadelphia chromosome; and group 2 with a relatively poor prognosis including i(17)(q10), -7/del7q, and 3q26.2 rearrangements. Patients in group 1 showed much better treatment response and survival than patients in group 2. When compared with cases with no ACAs, ACAs in group 2 conferred a worse survival irrelevant to the emergence phase and time. In contrast, ACAs in group 1 had no adverse impact on survival when they emerged from chronic phase or at the time of CML diagnosis. The concurrent presence of 2 or more ACAs conferred an inferior survival and can be categorized into the poor prognostic group.",Clinical Trial,1400.0,50.0,Clonal cytogenetic evolution with additional chromosomal abnormalities ACAs in chronic myelogenous CML is generally associated with decreased response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor TKI therapy and adverse survival Although ACAs are considered as a sign of disease progression and have been used as one of the criteria for accelerated phase the differential prognostic impact of individual ACAs in CML is unknown and a classification system to reflect such prognostic impact is lacking In this study we aimed to address these questions using a large cohort of CML patients treated in the era of TKIs We focused on cases with single chromosomal changes at the time of ACA emergence and stratified the 6 most common ACAs into 2 groups group 1 with a relatively good prognosis including trisomy 8 -Y and an extra copy of Philadelphia chromosome and group 2 with a relatively poor prognosis including i 17 q10 -7/del7q and 3q26.2 rearrangements Patients in group 1 showed much better treatment response and survival than patients in group 2 When compared with cases with no ACAs ACAs in group 2 conferred a worse survival irrelevant to the emergence phase and time In contrast ACAs in group 1 had no adverse impact on survival when they emerged from chronic phase or at the time of CML diagnosis The concurrent presence of 2 or more ACAs conferred an inferior survival and can be categorized into the poor prognostic group,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1946, 1266, 2554, 5, 402, 1860, 1171, 12238, 4, 442, 2194, 903, 16, 1228, 41, 5, 340, 51, 6, 564, 216, 230, 1379, 36, 2, 290, 25, 242, 12238, 32, 515, 22, 8, 7636, 1, 34, 91, 2, 47, 85, 95, 22, 104, 1, 3, 371, 9, 2241, 124, 3, 1777, 177, 345, 1, 797, 12238, 4, 903, 16, 860, 2, 8, 947, 398, 6, 2694, 225, 177, 345, 16, 1941, 4, 26, 45, 21, 1295, 6, 1539, 46, 1937, 75, 8, 375, 180, 1, 903, 7, 73, 4, 3, 1713, 1, 1671, 21, 1649, 23, 140, 5, 226, 1860, 400, 28, 3, 98, 1, 6285, 3397, 2, 1173, 3, 49, 96, 186, 12238, 237, 18, 271, 87, 14, 5, 8, 1352, 1178, 356, 141, 6317, 66, 2055, 2, 35, 3420, 1337, 1, 3006, 1170, 2, 87, 18, 5, 8, 1352, 334, 356, 141, 70, 269, 19649, 67, 67853, 2, 10678, 18, 2072, 7, 4, 87, 14, 224, 1802, 380, 24, 51, 2, 25, 76, 7, 4, 87, 18, 198, 72, 5, 140, 5, 77, 12238, 12238, 4, 87, 18, 3851, 8, 639, 25, 20237, 6, 3, 3397, 124, 2, 98, 4, 748, 12238, 4, 87, 14, 42, 77, 290, 345, 23, 25, 198, 491, 2054, 29, 442, 124, 15, 28, 3, 98, 1, 903, 147, 3, 750, 463, 1, 18, 15, 80, 12238, 3851, 35, 1663, 25, 2, 122, 40, 2320, 237, 3, 334, 177, 87]",1416.0,27006386,181
Haploidentical Natural Killer Cells Infused before Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation for Myeloid Malignancies: A Phase I Trial.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2016-04-16,"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is an effective treatment for high-risk myeloid malignancies, but relapse remains the major post-transplantation cause of treatment failure. Alloreactive natural killer (NK) cells mediate a potent antileukemic effect and may also enhance engraftment and reduce graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Haploidentical transplantations provide a setting in which NK cell alloreactivity can be manipulated, but they are associated with high rates of GVHD. We performed a phase I study infusing escalating doses of NK cells from an HLA haploidentical-related donor-selected for alloreactivity when possible-as a component of the preparative regimen for allotransplantation from a separate HLA-identical donor. The goal of infusing third-party alloreactive NK cells was to augment the antileukemic effect of the transplantation without worsening GVHD and, thus, improve the overall outcome of hematopoietic transplantation. Twenty-one patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or chronic myelogenous leukemia refractory or beyond first remission received a preparative regimen with busulfan and fludarabine followed by infusion of apheresis-derived, antibody-selected, and IL-2-activated NK cells. Doses were initially based on total nucleated cell (TNC) content and later based on CD56(+) cells to reduce variability. CD56(+) content ranged from .02 to 8.32 × 10(6)/kg. IL-2, .5 × 10(6) units/m(2) subcutaneously was administered daily for 5 days in the final cohort (n = 10). CD3(+) cells in the NK cell product were required to be < 10(5)/kg. Median relapse-free, overall, and GVHD-free/relapse-free survival for all patients enrolled was 102, 233, and 89 days, respectively. Five patients are alive, 5 patients died of transplantation-related causes, and 11 patients died of relapse. Despite the small sample size, survival was highly associated with CD56(+) cells delivered (P = .022) and development of ≥ grade 3 GVHD (P = .006). There were nonsignificant trends toward higher survival rates in those receiving NK cells from KIR ligand-mismatched donors and KIR-B haplotype donors. There was no association with disease type, remission at time of transplantation, or KIR content. GVHD was not associated with TNC, CD56(+), or CD3(+) cells infused in the NK cell product or the stem cell product. This trial demonstrates a lack of major toxicity attributable to third-party NK cell infusions delivered in combination with an HLA-compatible allogeneic transplantation. The infusion of haploidentical alloreactive NK cells was well tolerated and did not interfere with engraftment or increase the rate of GVHD after allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation. Durable complete remissions occurred in 5 patients at high risk for disease recurrence. This approach is being further developed in a phase I/II trial with ex vivo-expanded NK cells to increase the NK cell dose with the objective of reducing relapse and improving the outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation for AML/MDS.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",1375.0,41.0,Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is an effective treatment for high-risk myeloid malignancies but

Multiparameter Analysis of Off-Target Effects of Dasatinib on Bone Homeostasis in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia.,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2016-08-01,"We assessed patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) for serum calcium (Ca), phosphate (PO4), bone alkaline phosphatase, N-telopeptide (NTx), osteoprotegerin (OPG) levels, and trabecular bone area (TBA) in bone marrow (BM) specimens before and after treatment with dasatinib. We identified a significant increase in percentage of TBA in postdasatinib BM (P = .022). This suggests that dasatinib therapy can increase TBA without significant changes in bone and mineral metabolism. Interferences with bone homeostasis and mineral metabolism have been described in patients receiving imatinib for CML or gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Dasatinib is a potent second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed to inhibit ABL and SRC kinases while also interfering with the c-Kit, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and STAT5 pathways. We used a multiparameter approach to examine the off-target effects of dasatinib in 30 patients with CML treated between 2009 and 2012. We recorded serum Ca and PO4 levels, analyzed markers of bone formation (bone alkaline phosphatase/bone-specific alkaline phosphatase [BAP]) and bone resorption (NTx), measured OPG levels, and digitally analyzed changes in TBA in paired BM biopsy specimens before and after treatment. We correlated all findings with each other and with the results of conventional cytogenetic and molecular analyses. We identified a significant increase in the percentage of TBA in postdasatinib BM biopsy specimens (P = .022) and noted a decrease in serum OPG levels in 75% of patients.

A clinical observation of Chinese chronic myelogenous leukemia patients after discontinuation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2016-09-01,"Whether tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can be safely discontinued is a key focus of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) at present. We report a clinical observation of TKIs cessation in Chinese CML patients and a probable connection between CML leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and relapse. In all, 22 of 1057 patients consented to participate in this observation. The average time of complete molecular response was 12.73 months after TKI withdrawal. LSCs could be flow cytometrically detected in most of the patients. However, the number of LSCs did not differ between the relapsers and non-relapsers. We evaluated the leukemogenetic ability of the LSCs by transplanting bone marrow into irradiated NOD/SCID mice. The results indicated that part of the bone marrow from the relapsers lead to leukemogensis in the mice. Besides, we found that LSCs-derived microvesicles might serve as a novel factor for the stratification of undetectable minimal residual disease and an early warning sign of relapse. In summary, post-TKI cessation relapse seems to show none association with the number of LSCs. A mouse xenograft model would provide a novel and useful method of analyzing LSCs function and predicting relapse.

Resistance to imatinib in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and the splice variant BCR-ABL1(35INS).,Leukemia research,Leuk.

We reviewed all CML patients who had BCR-ABL1 kinase mutation analysis performed between August 1, 2007, and January 15, 2014. Patients who had BCR-ABL1(35INS) detected had their medical records reviewed to determine response to TKI therapy. Two hundred and eighty four patients had kinase mutation testing performed; of these, 64 patients (23%) had BCR-ABL1(35INS) detected. Forty-five patients were in chronic phase (70%), 10 were in accelerated phase (16%), 6 were in blastic phase (9%), and 3 were in other settings (5%). Of the 34 chronic phase patients who began therapy with imatinib, 23 patients (68%) failed therapy: 8 patients (24%) had primary refractory disease, 11 patients (32%) progressed, and 4 patients (12%) had disease progression after dose interruption. In contrast to the patients with disease progression or lack of response, none of 23 patients who were responding to imatinib had BCR-ABL1(35INS) detected.

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2018-01-02,"Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) and T cell depletion (TCD) through CD34<sup>+</sup> cell selection without the use of post-transplantation immunosuppression are 2 strategies used to reduce nonrelapse mortality (NRM) in older patients after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). To compare the efficacy of the RIC and TCD approaches, we evaluated the outcomes of patients age >50 years with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who underwent allo-HCT from an HLA-matched donor with one of these strategies. Baseline characteristics were comparable in the patients receiving TCD (n = 204) and those receiving RIC (n = 151), except for a higher proportion of unrelated donors (68% versus 40%; P < .001) and a higher comorbidity burden (Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index [HCT-CI] ≥3: 51% versus 38%; P < .001) in the TCD cohort. Analysis of outcomes at 3 years showed a higher chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)/relapse-free survival (CRFS) (51% versus 7%; P < .001), lower incidences of grade II-IV acute GVHD (18% versus 46% at day +180) and chronic GVHD (6% versus 55% at 3 years; P < .001), and a lower incidence of relapse (19% versus 33% at 3 years; P = .001) in the TCD group compared with the RIC group.

Bone marrow niche trafficking of miR-126 controls the self-renewal of leukemia stem cells in chronic myelogenous leukemia.,Nature medicine,Nat. Med.,2018-03-05,"Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in individuals with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (hereafter referred to as CML LSCs) are responsible for initiating and maintaining clonal hematopoiesis. These cells persist in the bone marrow (BM) despite effective inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase activity by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Here we show that although the microRNA (miRNA) miR-126 supported the quiescence, self-renewal and engraftment capacity of CML LSCs, miR-126 levels were lower in CML LSCs than in long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) from healthy individuals. Downregulation of miR-126 levels in CML LSCs was due to phosphorylation of Sprouty-related EVH1-domain-containing 1 (SPRED1) by BCR-ABL, which led to inhibition of the RAN-exportin-5-RCC1 complex that mediates miRNA maturation. Endothelial cells (ECs) in the BM supply miR-126 to CML LSCs to support quiescence and leukemia growth, as shown using mouse models of CML in which Mir126a (encoding miR-126) was conditionally knocked out in ECs and/or LSCs. Inhibition of BCR-ABL by TKI treatment caused an undesired increase in endogenous miR-126 levels, which enhanced LSC quiescence and persistence. Mir126a knockout in LSCs and/or ECs, or treatment with a miR-126 inhibitor that targets miR-126 expression in both LSCs and ECs, enhanced the in vivo anti-leukemic effects of TKI treatment and strongly diminished LSC leukemia-initiating capacity, providing a new strategy for the elimination of LSCs in individuals with CML.",Journal Article,687.0,14.0,stem cells LSCs in individuals with chronic myelogenous CML hereafter referred to as CML LSCs are responsible for initiating and maintaining clonal hematopoiesis These cells persist in the marrow BM despite effective inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase activity by tyrosine kinase inhibitors TKIs Here we show that although the microRNA miRNA miR-126 supported the quiescence self-renewal and engraftment capacity of CML LSCs miR-126 levels were lower in CML LSCs than in long-term hematopoietic stem cells LT-HSCs from healthy individuals Downregulation of miR-126 levels in CML LSCs was due to phosphorylation of Sprouty-related EVH1-domain-containing 1 SPRED1 by BCR-ABL which led to inhibition of the RAN-exportin-5-RCC1 complex that mediates miRNA maturation Endothelial cells ECs in the BM supply miR-126 to CML LSCs to support quiescence and growth as shown using mouse models of CML in which Mir126a encoding miR-126 was conditionally knocked out in ECs and/or LSCs Inhibition of BCR-ABL by TKI treatment caused an undesired increase in endogenous miR-126 levels which enhanced LSC quiescence and persistence Mir126a knockout in LSCs and/or ECs or treatment with a miR-126 inhibitor that targets miR-126 expression in both LSCs and ECs enhanced the in vivo anti-leukemic effects of TKI treatment and strongly diminished LSC leukemia-initiating capacity providing a new strategy for the elimination of LSCs in individuals with CML,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[452, 37, 7033, 4, 869, 5, 442, 2194, 903, 12394, 1995, 6, 22, 903, 7033, 32, 2327, 9, 2637, 2, 3284, 1946, 5114, 46, 37, 5589, 4, 3, 581, 1246, 550, 323, 297, 1, 1062, 1425, 216, 128, 20, 564, 216, 222, 1671, 467, 21, 514, 17, 242, 3, 3213, 2053, 722, 3927, 2708, 3, 13957, 1074, 4495, 2, 2881, 2162, 1, 903, 7033, 722, 3927, 148, 11, 280, 4, 903, 7033, 76, 4, 319, 337, 1007, 452, 37, 4980, 6185, 29, 1331, 869, 2475, 1, 722, 3927, 148, 4, 903, 7033, 10, 520, 6, 982, 1, 26364, 139, 72306, 1398, 1101, 14, 32472, 20, 1062, 1425, 92, 836, 6, 297, 1, 3, 22354, 18663, 33, 43830, 840, 17, 3961, 2053, 4537, 845, 37, 5861, 4, 3, 1246, 6296, 722, 3927, 6, 903, 7033, 6, 538, 13957, 2, 129, 22, 443, 75, 830, 274, 1, 903, 4, 92, 50911, 2362, 722, 3927, 10, 12704, 10237, 1205, 4, 5861, 2, 15, 7033, 297, 1, 1062, 1425, 20, 1379, 24, 1546, 35, 25210, 344, 4, 2682, 722, 3927, 148, 92, 651, 6643, 13957, 2, 4108, 50911, 5687, 4, 7033, 2, 15, 5861, 15, 24, 5, 8, 722, 3927, 230, 17, 637, 722, 3927, 55, 4, 110, 7033, 2, 5861, 651, 3, 4, 386, 312, 2015, 176, 1, 1379, 24, 2, 1327, 2849, 6643, 2647, 2637, 2162, 1736, 8, 217, 692, 9, 3, 3730, 1, 7033, 4, 869, 5, 903]",1430.0,29505034,73
"A Comparison of the Myeloablative Conditioning Regimen Fludarabine/Busulfan with Cyclophosphamide/Total Body Irradiation, for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation in the Modern Era: A Cohort Analysis.",Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2018-03-16,"With improvement in transplantation practices in the modern era, nonrelapse mortality (NRM) following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has improved, while disease relapse rates have remained unchanged. Survival outcomes are therefore driven by NRM in the modern era. Myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens are used to maximize disease control and facilitate engraftment; however, their use is often limited by toxicity. The commonly used MAC regimens incorporate either chemotherapy plus total body irradiation (TBI) or combination chemotherapy. Furthermore, reduced-toxicity myeloablative (RTM) regimens, such as fludarabine/busulfan (FluBu), have emerged as alternatives to traditional MAC and their impact on outcomes in the current era have not been fully investigated. In this study, we compare outcomes following HSCT, using the chemotherapy only RTM MAC regimens FluBu with the chemoradiotherapy regimen cyclophosphamide/TBI (CyTBI), for patients with hematologic malignancies who underwent MAC HSCT at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. We hypothesized that the chemotherapy-only regimen would fare better, primarily due to improved NRM. A retrospective cohort analysis was performed on 387 patients with myeloid or lymphoid hematologic malignancies who underwent HLA-matched related (8/8), matched unrelated (8/8), or single-antigen mismatched unrelated (7/8) HSCT following myeloablative conditioning. Patients received FluBu (n = 158) or CyTBI (n = 229). The primary outcome was overall survival (OS) and all other outcomes were regarded as secondary. A subset analysis was performed for patients <55 years of age and for acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome patients of age <55 years. For the whole cohort, 3-year OS was similar for FluBu compared with CyTBI in unadjusted analysis. However, in multivariable analysis, FluBu resulted in superior OS compared with CyTBI (3-year adjusted estimate: 65% versus 55%, respectively; HR for death, .62; 95% CI, .40 to .97; P = .036). While relapse rates were similar between the 2 regimens, NRM and acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (grade II to IV) were significantly worse with CyTBI compared with FluBu. Rates of chronic GVHD were similar between 2 regimens. These results were consistent in a subset of patients <55 years of age and in acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome patients below 55 years of age. The RTM chemotherapy-only regimen FluBu appears to be as effective and more tolerable than the chemoradiotherapy regimen CyTBI, leading to better OS driven by better NRM. The improvement in NRM was attributable chiefly to lower rates of grade II to IV acute GVHD. Relapse rates were not increased with FluBu. In the absence of randomized data, FluBu appears to be the optimal regimen for myeloablative HSCT in patients of all age groups.",Comparative Study,676.0,3.0,With improvement in transplantation

The co-occurrence of driver mutations in chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.,Annals of hematology,Ann. Hematol.,2018-06-27,"Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal disorders characterized by proliferation of one or more elements of the myeloid lineage. Key genetic aberrations include the BCR-ABL1 gene rearrangement in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and JAK2/MPL/CALR aberrations in Philadelphia chromosome-negative MPNs. While thought to be mutually exclusive, occasional isolated reports of coexistence of BCR-ABL1 and JAK2, and JAK2 with MPL or CALR aberrations have been described.

Comparative Analysis of Calcineurin Inhibitor-Based Methotrexate and Mycophenolate Mofetil-Containing Regimens for Prevention of Graft-versus-Host Disease after Reduced-Intensity Conditioning Allogeneic Transplantation.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2018-08-25,"The combination of a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) such as tacrolimus (TAC) or cyclosporine (CYSP) with methotrexate (MTX) or with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has been commonly used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT), but there are limited data comparing efficacy of the 2 regimens. We evaluated 1564 adult patients who underwent RIC alloHCT for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) from 2000 to 2013 using HLA-identical sibling (matched related donor [MRD]) or unrelated donor (URD) peripheral blood graft and received CYSP or TAC with MTX or MMF for GVHD prophylaxis. Primary outcomes of the study were acute and chronic GVHD and overall survival (OS). The study divided the patient population into 4 cohorts based on regimen: MMF-TAC, MMF-CYSP, MTX-TAC, and MTX-CYSP. In the URD group, MMF-CYSP was associated with increased risk of grade II to IV acute GVHD (relative risk [RR], 1.78; P < .001) and grade III to IV acute GVHD (RR, 1.93; P = .006) compared with MTX-TAC. In the URD group, use of MMF-TAC (versus MTX-TAC) lead to higher nonrelapse mortality. (hazard ratio, 1.48; P = .008). In either group, no there was no difference in chronic GVHD, disease-free survival, and OS among the GVHD prophylaxis regimens. For RIC alloHCT using MRD, there are no differences in outcomes based on GVHD prophylaxis. However, with URD RIC alloHCT, MMF-CYSP was inferior to MTX-based regimens for acute GVHD prevention, but all the regimens were equivalent in terms of chronic GVHD and OS.

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2018-10-03,"Peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) from unrelated donors can serve as a graft source for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Currently, PB is most commonly used in roughly 80% of adult recipients. Determining the long-term impact of graft source on outcomes would inform this decision. Data collected by the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research from 5200 adult recipients of a first HCT from an 8/8 or 7/8 HLA antigen-matched unrelated donor for treatment of acute leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome between 2001 and 2011 were analyzed to determine the impact of graft source on graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) relapse-free survival (GRFS), defined as freedom from grade III/IV acute GVHD, chronic GVHD requiring immunosuppressive therapy, relapse, and death, and overall survival. GRFS at 2 years was superior in BM recipients compared with PB recipients (16%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 14% to 18% versus 10%; 95% CI, 8% to 11%; P <.0001) in the 8/8 HLA-matched cohort and 7/8 HLA-matched cohort (11%; 95% CI, 8% to 14% versus 5%; 95% CI, 4% to 7%; P = .001).

The inferior 5-year survival in the PB cohort was attributable to a higher frequency of deaths while in remission compared with the BM cohort. For recipients of 7/8 HLA-matched grafts, survival at 5 years was similar in BM recipients and PB recipients (32% versus 29%; P = .329).

Res.,2018-10-25,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm consistently associated with the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene located in the Philadelphia chromosome. The Blast Phase is diagnosed when blasts are ≥20% of the peripheral blood white cell count or of bone marrow nucleated cells or when there is an extramedullary blast proliferation. Megakaryocytic blast crisis as the presenting manifestation of CML is extremely rare and only 7 reported cases were found in the literature. Out of 34 cases of CML-Blast Phase between April 2015 and June 2016, 3 cases showed megakaryocytic differentiation. 2 of these presented in Blast phase as the first manifestation of CML and the third case was a known case of CML-Chronic phase. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping was performed on peripheral blood/bone marrow using 6- color flow cytometer Navios. On CD45 vs SSC two distinct populations of blasts were seen in two cases and single population in the third case. All the 3 cases were positive for CD61, cCD41, cCD61 confirming the megakaryocytic lineage. The clinical features, morphologic and cytogenetic findings help in the identification and distinction of megakaryocytic blast phase of CML from Acute Megakayoblastic Leukemia.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of concomitant TKI-PPI receipt and its impact on survival and therapy discontinuation in older adults with cancer. This retrospective study used linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data for the years 2007 through 2012. In total, 12,538 patients with lung cancer, renal cell cancer, chronic myelogenous leukemia, liver cancer, or pancreatic cancer were included. The primary exposure variable was concomitant receipt of TKI-PPI, defined as at least 30 days of PPI use in the first 90 days from the start of the TKI (exposure period). The outcomes measured were overall survival and discontinuation of therapy in 90 days and 1 year after the end of the exposure period. Cox proportional-hazards regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to evaluate the association between exposure and outcome. The overall prevalence of TKI-PPI receipt was 22.7%. Predictors that were associated with increased use included polypharmacy and prior PPI receipt. TKI-PPI use decreased survival in 90 days (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.28) and in 1 year (hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.18) but was not associated with discontinuation. Nearly 1 in 4 older adults with cancer who receive TKIs also receive PPIs concomitantly, and concomitant use is associated with an increased risk of death. Concerted efforts to manage medications are needed to identify and reduce the receipt of PPIs when TKIs are initiated.",Journal Article,383.0,3.0,"The concomitant use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors TKIs and proton pump inhibitors PPIs is a significant concern because of potential drug-drug interaction that reduces TKI absorption thus potentially reducing the effectiveness of TKIs The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of concomitant TKI-PPI receipt and its impact on survival and therapy discontinuation in older adults with cancer This retrospective study used linked Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare data for the years 2007 through 2012 In total 12,538 patients with cancer cell cancer chronic myelogenous cancer or cancer were included The primary exposure variable was concomitant receipt of TKI-PPI defined as at least 30 days of PPI use in the first 90 days from the start of the TKI exposure period The outcomes measured were overall survival and discontinuation of therapy in 90 days and 1 year after the end of the exposure period Cox proportional-hazards regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to evaluate the association between exposure and outcome The overall prevalence of TKI-PPI receipt was 22.7 Predictors that were associated with increased use included polypharmacy and prior PPI receipt TKI-PPI use decreased survival in 90 days hazard ratio 1.16 95 confidence interval 1.05-1.28 and in 1 year hazard ratio 1.10 95 confidence interval 1.04-1.18 but was not associated with discontinuation Nearly 1 in 4 older adults with cancer who receive TKIs also receive PPIs concomitantly and concomitant use is associated with an increased risk of death Concerted efforts to manage medications are needed to identify and reduce the receipt of PPIs when TKIs are initiated",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1781, 119, 1, 564, 216, 222, 1671, 2, 2095, 6320, 222, 19274, 16, 8, 93, 2893, 408, 1, 174, 234, 234, 915, 17, 2389, 1379, 6125, 631, 751, 1818, 3, 1236, 1, 1671, 3, 461, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 376, 3, 1078, 2, 674, 1, 1781, 1379, 9384, 1699, 2, 211, 345, 23, 25, 2, 36, 2007, 4, 434, 857, 5, 12, 26, 459, 45, 95, 1199, 617, 1284, 2, 396, 99, 1378, 74, 9, 3, 60, 1307, 298, 1195, 4, 181, 133, 10901, 7, 5, 12, 31, 12, 442, 2194, 12, 15, 12, 11, 159, 3, 86, 645, 1347, 10, 1781, 1699, 1, 1379, 9384, 395, 22, 28, 506, 201, 162, 1, 9384, 119, 4, 3, 157, 424, 162, 29, 3, 2435, 1, 3, 1379, 645, 727, 3, 123, 644, 11, 63, 25, 2, 2007, 1, 36, 4, 424, 162, 2, 14, 111, 50, 3, 396, 1, 3, 645, 727, 418, 831, 1017, 320, 5, 2931, 1320, 1, 24, 7775, 10, 95, 6, 376, 3, 248, 59, 645, 2, 228, 3, 63, 1078, 1, 1379, 9384, 1699, 10, 350, 67, 674, 17, 11, 41, 5, 101, 119, 159, 12410, 2, 324, 9384, 1699, 1379, 9384, 119, 340, 25, 4, 424, 162, 360, 197, 14, 245, 48, 307, 268, 14, 474, 14, 339, 2, 4, 14, 111, 360, 197, 14, 79, 48, 307, 268, 14, 755, 14, 203, 84, 10, 44, 41, 5, 2007, 1857, 14, 4, 39, 434, 857, 5, 12, 54, 560, 1671, 120, 560, 19274, 6485, 2, 1781, 119, 16, 41, 5, 35, 101, 43, 1, 273, 12645, 1413, 6, 4001, 2679, 32, 575, 6, 255, 2, 969, 3, 1699, 1, 19274, 198, 1671, 32, 1917]",1718.0,30605231,51
Biology and treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia.,"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)","Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",1997-09-01,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) involves the clonal expansion of hemopoietic progenitor cells associated with a characteristic translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, resulting in the generation of an aberrant bcr-abl protein with enhanced tyrosine kinase activity. Although the precise molecular events leading to malignant expansion of the myeloid cell line are as yet undetermined, bcr-abl can induce cell proliferation, transformation of immature hemopoietic cells, and suppression of apoptosis in vitro. Abnormalities of stromal/progenitor cell interaction may be central to the pathogenesis of the abnormal hemopoiesis in CML. In chronic-phase CML, therapy with interferon-alfa (Intron A, Roferon-A) produces hematologic responses in up to 70% to 80% of patients and partial or complete cytogenetic responses in up to 50%, with many studies showing a significant overall survival advantage for responding patients. Allogeneic marrow transplantation can result in long-term survival and cure in patients with CML, particularly younger patients transplanted early in the course of the disease, and unrelated-donor or autologous marrow transplantation may be an option for patients without a matched sibling donor.
