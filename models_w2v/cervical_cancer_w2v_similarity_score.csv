The clinical course of deep vein thrombosis in patients with gynecologic cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2002-01-01,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the survival of gynecologic cancer patients diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients admitted to our institution with gynecologic malignancy who were diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) between 1984 and 1995. Data were collected regarding site, stage, histology, treatment, and proximity of DVT to treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. This study was limited to cases of ovarian, uterine, and cervical cancer. Descriptive statistics were generated and the survival of patients from the time of DVT was calculated using the Kaplan and Meier method. Cases were then matched by site, stage, histology, and age to controls without DVT to evaluate the effect of DVT on survival. A Cox regression model was used to assess the effect of multiple variables on survival. A total of 74 cases were identified. Ovarian, uterine, and cervical cancer accounted for 45, 27, and 28% of cases, respectively. Approximately 64% of patients had stage III or greater disease. The median survival of all patients from the time of DVT diagnosis was 7.8 months, with only about 20% of patients surviving at 5 years. Patients with cervical cancer or patients who had radiation therapy within 3 months of DVT diagnosis had significantly lessened survival (P < 0.01) than other patients with DVT. The survival of patients from the time of cancer diagnosis with venous thrombosis was significantly worse than a matched control group without DVT (P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, there was a twofold greater risk of dying in those patients with gynecologic cancer and DVT. The development of DVT in conjunction with a gynecologic malignancy connotes a poor prognosis, especially in patients with cervical cancer. It is possible that this poor prognosis is related to the pathophysiology that results in venous thrombosis and not just the presence of cancer.",Journal Article,6594.0,35.0,The aim of this study was to evaluate the survival of gynecologic cancer patients diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients admitted to our institution with gynecologic malignancy who were diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis DVT between 1984 and 1995 Data were collected regarding site stage histology treatment and proximity of DVT to treatment with surgery chemotherapy and radiotherapy This study was limited to cases of and cancer Descriptive statistics were generated and the survival of patients from the time of DVT was calculated using the Kaplan and Meier method Cases were then matched by site stage histology and age to controls without DVT to evaluate the effect of DVT on survival A Cox regression model was used to assess the effect of multiple variables on survival A total of 74 cases were identified and cancer accounted for 45 27 and 28 of cases respectively Approximately 64 of patients had stage III or greater disease The median survival of all patients from the time of DVT diagnosis was 7.8 months with only about 20 of patients surviving at 5 years Patients with cancer or patients who had radiation therapy within 3 months of DVT diagnosis had significantly lessened survival P 0.01 than other patients with DVT The survival of patients from the time of cancer diagnosis with venous thrombosis was significantly worse than a matched control group without DVT P 0.001 On multivariate analysis there was a twofold greater risk of dying in those patients with gynecologic cancer and DVT The development of DVT in conjunction with a gynecologic malignancy connotes a poor prognosis especially in patients with cancer It is possible that this poor prognosis is related to the pathophysiology that results in venous thrombosis and not just the presence of cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[3, 1130, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 376, 3, 25, 1, 1512, 12, 7, 265, 5, 2369, 2762, 2839, 21, 894, 446, 3, 4413, 1, 7, 4319, 6, 114, 731, 5, 1512, 710, 54, 11, 265, 5, 2369, 2762, 2839, 6311, 59, 6036, 2, 2323, 74, 11, 786, 666, 606, 82, 784, 24, 2, 6167, 1, 6311, 6, 24, 5, 152, 56, 2, 310, 26, 45, 10, 383, 6, 140, 1, 2, 12, 3778, 3065, 11, 1419, 2, 3, 25, 1, 7, 29, 3, 98, 1, 6311, 10, 981, 75, 3, 876, 2, 882, 596, 140, 11, 818, 655, 20, 606, 82, 784, 2, 89, 6, 535, 187, 6311, 6, 376, 3, 254, 1, 6311, 23, 25, 8, 418, 320, 202, 10, 95, 6, 423, 3, 254, 1, 232, 682, 23, 25, 8, 181, 1, 794, 140, 11, 108, 2, 12, 3688, 9, 512, 428, 2, 339, 1, 140, 106, 705, 660, 1, 7, 42, 82, 316, 15, 378, 34, 3, 52, 25, 1, 62, 7, 29, 3, 98, 1, 6311, 147, 10, 67, 66, 53, 5, 158, 545, 179, 1, 7, 3050, 28, 33, 60, 7, 5, 12, 15, 7, 54, 42, 121, 36, 262, 27, 53, 1, 6311, 147, 42, 97, 21933, 25, 19, 13, 355, 76, 127, 7, 5, 6311, 3, 25, 1, 7, 29, 3, 98, 1, 12, 147, 5, 2167, 2839, 10, 97, 639, 76, 8, 655, 182, 87, 187, 6311, 19, 13, 144, 23, 331, 65, 125, 10, 8, 8144, 378, 43, 1, 4536, 4, 135, 7, 5, 1512, 12, 2, 6311, 3, 193, 1, 6311, 4, 3357, 5, 8, 1512, 710, 33155, 8, 334, 356, 1093, 4, 7, 5, 12, 192, 16, 899, 17, 26, 334, 356, 16, 139, 6, 3, 4320, 17, 99, 4, 2167, 2839, 2, 44, 4673, 3, 463, 1, 12]",1826.0,11748979,792
Stage IIB-IVB cervical adenocarcinoma: prognostic factors and survival.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2002-01-01,"The incidence of cervical adenocarcinoma is increasing relative to squamous cell carcinoma and all cervical cancers. Few reports have described the outcome of patients with advanced cervical adenocarcinoma. The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic factors and survival for patients with stage IIB-IVB disease. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained to perform a computerized search of all women diagnosed with cervical adenocarcinoma at our three institutions between 1982 and 2000. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical follow-up was obtained from the SGO database and tumor registry and via correspondence with health care providers. Statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression for clinical variables and the log-rank test to compare Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. Eighty-three women with FIGO stage IIB-IVB cervical adenocarcinoma were identified. The median patient age was 53 years (range, 22-88). The median follow-up of 17 (20%) surviving patients was 33 months (range, 6-147); 66 (80%) died during the study interval. Stage IIB disease, young patient age, and grade 1 histology were independent variables having a favorable impact on survival (each P < 0.02). Stage IIB patients (n = 41) were more likely to be alive at 2 (64% vs 8%) and 5 years (30% vs 0%) than women with stage IIIA-IVB disease (n = 42; P < 0.01).

Method and timing of tumor volume measurement for outcome prediction in cervical cancer using magnetic resonance imaging.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2002-01-01,"Recently, imaging-based tumor volume before, during, and after radiation therapy (RT) has been shown to predict tumor response in cervical cancer. However, the effectiveness of different methods and timing of imaging-based tumor size assessment have not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to compare the predictive value for treatment outcome derived from simple diameter-based ellipsoid tumor volume measurement using orthogonal diameters (with ellipsoid computation) with that derived from more complex contour tracing/region-of-interest (ROI) analysis 3D tumor volumetry. Serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations were prospectively performed in 60 patients with advanced cervical cancer (Stages IB2-IVB/recurrent) at the start of RT, during early RT (20-25 Gy), mid-RT (45-50 Gy), and at follow-up (1-2 months after RT completion). ROI-based volumetry was derived by tracing the entire tumor region in each MR slice on the computer work station. For the diameter-based surrogate ""ellipsoid volume,"" the three orthogonal diameters (d1, d2, d3) were measured on film hard copies to calculate volume as an ellipsoid (d1 x d2 x d3 x pi/6). Serial tumor volumes and regression rates determined by each method were correlated with local control, disease-free and overall survival, and the results were compared between the two measuring methods. Median post-therapy follow-up was 4.9 years (range, 2.0-8.2 years). The best method and time point of tumor size measurement for the prediction of outcome was the tumor regression rate in the mid-therapy MRI examination (at 45-50 Gy) using 3D ROI volumetry. For the pre-RT measurement both the diameter-based method and ROI volumetry provided similar predictive accuracy, particularly for patients with small (<40 cm3) and large (> or =100 cm3) pre-RT tumor size. However, the pre-RT tumor size measured by either method had much less predictive value for the intermediate-size (40-99 cm3) tumors, which accounted for the majority of patients (55%). Tumor regression rate (fast vs. slow) obtained during mid-RT (45-50 Gy), which could only be appreciated by 3D ROI volumetry, had the best outcome prediction rate for local control (84% vs. 22%, p < 0.0001) and disease-free survival (63% vs. 20%, p = 0.0005). Within the difficult to classify intermediate pre-RT size group, slow ROI-based regression rate predicted all treatment failures (local control rate: 0% vs. 91%, p < 0.0001; disease-free survival: 0% vs. 73%, p < 0.0001). Mid-RT regression rate based on simple diameter measurement did not predict outcome. The early-RT and post-RT measurements were least useful with either measuring method. Our preliminary data suggest that for the prediction of treatment outcome in cervical cancer, initial tumor volume can be estimated by simple diameter-based measurement obtained from film hard copies. When initial tumor volume is in the intermediate size range, ROI volumetry and an additional MRI during RT are needed to quantitatively analyze tumor regression rate for the prediction of treatment

An orthotopic nude mouse model of oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2002-01-01,"Despite advances in our understanding, prevention, and treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), the 5-year survival rates for patients remain low. This poor prognosis for head and neck SCC and SCC of the oral tongue (SCCOT) in particular reflects a limited understanding of the mechanisms of local and regional metastasis, which accounts for a majority of deaths. To analyze the molecular and cellular mechanisms of metastasis, we have developed an orthotopic nude mouse model of SCCOT. Nude mice were injected submucosally in the tongue or subcutis with human squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity cell lines Tu159, Tu167, and MDA1986. The mice were necropsied and examined for the presence of primary tumors, and regional and systemic metastases. For all three of the squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity cell lines, tumors developed more readily in the orthotopic site, the tongue, than in the ectopic subcutis. MDA1986 cells were highly tumorigenic, particularly at the orthotopic site, with as few as 5 x 10(3) cells producing tumors in all of the mice. In contrast, s.c. tumor formation required at least 1 x 10(5) cells. The tumorigenicity observed between those mice given submucosal inoculation and those mice given s.c. inoculation (P < 0.0001). Regional metastases initially occurred in <10% of mice. To generate tumor lines of increased metastatic potential, regional metastases were isolated from cervical lymph nodes after the development of orthotopic tongue tumors. Serial passage of these lymph nodes resulted in a cell line more metastatic than its parental line. When injected into the tongues of mice, these cells metastasized to regional lymph nodes in 30% of mice and to the lungs in 20%. In this orthotopic murine model, oral tongue cancer recapitulates the behavior of human SCCOT, allowing for detailed studies of its biology and therapy.",Journal Article,6594.0,119.0,Despite advances in our understanding prevention and treatment of head and squamous cell carcinoma SCC the 5-year survival rates for patients remain low This poor prognosis for head and SCC and SCC of the oral tongue SCCOT in particular reflects a limited understanding of the mechanisms of local and regional metastasis which accounts for a majority of deaths To analyze the molecular and cellular mechanisms of metastasis we have developed an orthotopic nude mouse model of SCCOT Nude mice were injected submucosally in the tongue or subcutis with human squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity cell lines Tu159 Tu167 and MDA1986 The mice were necropsied and examined for the presence of primary tumors and regional and systemic metastases For all three of the squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity cell lines tumors developed more readily in the orthotopic site the tongue than in the ectopic subcutis MDA1986 cells were highly tumorigenic particularly at the orthotopic site with as few as 5 x 10 3 cells producing tumors in all of the mice In contrast s.c. tumor formation required at least 1 x 10 5 cells The tumorigenicity observed between those mice given submucosal inoculation and those mice given s.c. inoculation P 0.0001 Regional metastases initially occurred in 10 of mice To generate tumor lines of increased metastatic potential regional metastases were isolated from lymph nodes after the development of orthotopic tongue tumors Serial passage of these lymph nodes resulted in a cell line more metastatic than its parental line When injected into the tongues of mice these cells metastasized to regional lymph nodes in 30 of mice and to the lungs in 20 In this orthotopic murine model oral tongue cancer recapitulates the behavior of human SCCOT allowing for detailed studies of its biology and therapy,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[550, 954, 4, 114, 612, 1070, 2, 24, 1, 718, 2, 691, 31, 134, 1791, 3, 33, 111, 25, 151, 9, 7, 918, 154, 26, 334, 356, 9, 718, 2, 1791, 2, 1791, 1, 3, 518, 4391, 10948, 4, 1454, 5224, 8, 383, 612, 1, 3, 483, 1, 293, 2, 951, 278, 92, 4162, 9, 8, 686, 1, 1043, 6, 1992, 3, 219, 2, 763, 483, 1, 278, 21, 47, 276, 35, 2157, 2598, 830, 202, 1, 10948, 2598, 399, 11, 2651, 37075, 4, 3, 4391, 15, 15089, 5, 171, 691, 31, 134, 1, 3, 518, 2405, 31, 285, 27844, 20990, 2, 23073, 3, 399, 11, 42833, 2, 409, 9, 3, 463, 1, 86, 57, 2, 951, 2, 403, 196, 9, 62, 169, 1, 3, 691, 31, 134, 1, 3, 518, 2405, 31, 285, 57, 276, 80, 3860, 4, 3, 2157, 606, 3, 4391, 76, 4, 3, 3647, 15089, 23073, 37, 11, 561, 3795, 823, 28, 3, 2157, 606, 5, 22, 1021, 22, 33, 1006, 79, 27, 37, 3787, 57, 4, 62, 1, 3, 399, 4, 748, 695, 256, 30, 1264, 616, 28, 506, 14, 1006, 79, 33, 37, 3, 5538, 164, 59, 135, 399, 447, 9729, 9229, 2, 135, 399, 447, 695, 256, 9229, 19, 13, 488, 951, 196, 1625, 489, 4, 79, 1, 399, 6, 2562, 30, 285, 1, 101, 113, 174, 951, 196, 11, 1355, 29, 263, 502, 50, 3, 193, 1, 2157, 4391, 57, 2108, 7740, 1, 46, 263, 502, 627, 4, 8, 31, 328, 80, 113, 76, 211, 3418, 328, 198, 2651, 237, 3, 23074, 1, 399, 46, 37, 8486, 6, 951, 263, 502, 4, 201, 1, 399, 2, 6, 3, 4465, 4, 179, 4, 26, 2157, 1471, 202, 518, 4391, 12, 11076, 3, 1710, 1, 171, 10948, 2952, 9, 2455, 94, 1, 211, 891, 2, 36]",1826.0,11801572,56
Early-stage cervical adenocarcinoma treated by surgical intent: the role of para-aortic lymph node dissection.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2002-02-01,"Previous reports suggest that cervical adenocarcinomas have a unique pattern of spread and are more apt to metastasize to para-aortic lymph nodes. The purpose of this study was to further define the node of para-aortic lymph node dissection in early-stage cervical adenocarcinoma treated by surgical intent. Institutional review board approval was obtained to perform a computerized search of the data of all women diagnosed with cervical adenocarcinoma between 1982 and 2000. Hospital charts were retrospectively reviewed. Follow-up was obtained from the tumor registry, medical records, and correspondence with health care providers. Three hundred (87%) of 345 early-stage (FIGO IA(1)-IIA) cervical adenocarcinoma patients were primarily treated by surgical intent. Two hundred seventy-six underwent pelvic and para-aortic node dissection (n = 69) or pelvic node dissection only (n = 207); 24 had no lymph node dissection. The median number of lymph nodes removed was 13 pelvic (range, 1-58) and 3 para-aortic (range, 1-17). Three (4%) of 69 patients had para-aortic nodal metastases. Each had either grossly evident para-aortic adenopathy (n = 2) or an adnexal metastasis. Thirty-six of 40 women developing recurrent disease had at least some component of pelvic recurrence; 4 had only extrapelvic disease. Three patients undergoing para-aortic node dissection developed an isolated extrapelvic recurrence despite originally negative para-aortic nodes (n = 2) or treatment by extended-field radiation for para-aortic metastases. One woman undergoing only pelvic node dissection had an isolated extrapelvic recurrence despite originally negative nodes. Early-stage cervical adenocarcinoma primarily treated by surgical intent has a very low risk of para-aortic metastases.

Replication-selective herpes simplex virus type 1 mutant therapy of cervical cancer is enhanced by low-dose radiation.,Human gene therapy,Hum. Gene Ther.,2002-03-01,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)-based oncolytic treatment is a promising therapeutic approach for malignancy. Recombinant strains of HSV-1 containing mutations in the ICP 34.5 protein have been shown to replicate preferentially in rapidly proliferating malignant cells, resulting in a direct cytolytic effect. We assessed the efficacy of multimutated HSV-1 strains on human cervical cancer, and then used these viruses in combination with radiation therapy, the standard treatment for cervical cancer. The HSV-1 mutants 4009, 7020, 3616, and G207 induced significant lysis of three established human cervical cancer cell lines in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. G207 intratumoral treatment of established subcutaneous C33a tumors in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice significantly reduced tumor burden by 50%. Weekly and triweekly treatments improved efficacy and inhibited flank tumor growth in an administration frequency-dependent manner without toxicity. Combination therapy of a low dose of radiation (1.5 or 3 Gy) and replication-selective HSV mutants infection exhibited increased antitumor effects against cervical cancer cells in vitro. The in vivo effect of G207 combined with low-dose radiation was studied in Me180 xenografts in athymic mice. Treatment of established Me180 tumor nodules with 3 Gy followed by intratumoral G207 administration greatly improved efficacy, resulting in 42% complete eradication of tumor. In conclusion, single and multiple intratumoral injections of G207 significantly reduced tumor burden in xenogeneic models of cervical cancer, and the addition of low-dose radiation further potentiated the effect.

Detection of female lower genital tract dysplasia using orally administered 5-aminolevulinic acid induced protoporphyrin IX: a preliminary study.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2002-04-01,"Previous studies have suggested that 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) may be used topically on the cervix to allow optical detection of cervical dysplasia, based on the fluorescence of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) synthesized in situ from ALA. However, the uniformity of distribution of topically applied PpIX and the sensitivity and specificity of detection are not optimal. The current study was undertaken to demonstrate the feasibility of administering ALA by mouth (po) with the hypothesis that systemic administration might provide a more reliable diagnostic tool. Oral ALA was administered to 14 patients with abnormal Pap smears in a dose- and time-intensity design. Institutional review board approval was obtained. A starting dose of 10 mg/kg of po ALA was administered and colposcopy was performed in 3 patients at 1 h, 3 patients at 2 h, 6 patients at 3 h, and 2 patients at 4 h. The study was written with the intent to increase the dose in 10 mg/kg increments if fluorescence was not detected; however, fluorescence was detected at the first dose level. Liver function tests were checked pre and post ALA and follow-up telephone calls were made regarding possible side effects. Both white and blue light colposcopy examinations were performed by two blinded clinicians and biopsies of all abnormal areas were performed. All patients tolerated po ALA well, with no systemic side effects. At the 10 mg/kg dose there was no reported nausea or photosensitivity. Optimal fluorescence was achieved at the 3-h time point, with quenching noted at the 4-h time point. Excellent absorption was documented with fluorescence of the lip demonstrated with Wood's lamp. In some cases fluorescence correlated with dysplasia on biopsy. 5-ALA given via the po route and at the dose and time period studied is well tolerated and affords fluorescence of the cervix.

Radiation myelitis in a 5-year-old girl.,Journal of child neurology,J. Child Neurol.,2002-03-01,"Myelopathy is an uncommon complication of radiotherapy, particularly in the pediatric age group. A 5-year-old girl with acute lymphoblastic leukemia developed a severe but transient radiculopathy after intrathecal administration of methotrexate and cytarabine for an isolated central nervous system relapse. Chemotherapy was then given through an intraventricular catheter. Owing to a second central nervous system recurrence, she was treated with craniospinal radiation. The whole brain down to the level of C2 received a dose of 2400 cGy.

Recurrent cervical cancer.,Current treatment options in oncology,Curr Treat Options Oncol,2002-04-01,"There are limited treatment options for patients with recurrent cervical carcinoma. Because of low response rates and a negligible impact on long-term survival, the use of chemotherapy in patients with unresectable recurrent disease should be considered palliative. Generally, radiation therapy in previously irradiated patients is considered palliative. For patients who develop recurrent disease after definitive surgery who have not received prior radiation therapy, salvage radiation therapy is the treatment of choice. Similarly, patients who have received definitive primary radiation therapy are candidates for surgical resection of their recurrence. However, there are specific criteria for surgical resection. Radical hysterectomy may be an option for the very rare patient with a small (<2 cm) centrally located recurrence in the cervix or vaginal fornices. However, for most patients, pelvic exenteration remains the only therapeutic option that offers the possibility of long-term survival. Patients who are candidates for exenteration are those with central local recurrences that have not extended to the pelvic sidewalls. The introduction of high-dose-rate intraoperative radiation therapy (HDR-IORT) combined with radical surgical resection has widened the scope of patients who may be offered surgery. Patients who in the past may not have been surgical candidates may benefit from radical surgical resection combined with HDR-IORT. All patients who are surgically fit and have undergone previous radiation therapy should be considered for surgical resection for centrally located recurrences.

Oncolytic herpesvirus effectively treats murine squamous cell carcinoma and spreads by natural lymphatics to treat sites of lymphatic metastases.,Human gene therapy,Hum. Gene Ther.,2002-07-01,"Oncolytic herpesviruses have significant antitumoral effects in animal models when delivered directly to established tumors. Lymphatic metastases are a common occurrence for many tumor types. This study investigates the potential of an attenuated, replication-competent, oncolytic herpes simplex virus (NV1023) both to treat a primary tumor by direct injection and to travel through the lymphatic system to treat metastatic tumor within the lymph nodes draining lymph from the site of primary cancer. Isosulfan blue dye was injected into murine auricles to determine normal lymphatic drainage patterns and demonstrated consistent blue staining of a group of ipsilateral cervical lymph nodes. Auricular injections of NV1023 resulted in viral transit to these lymph nodes as measured by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside histochemistry and viral plaque assay. An oncolytic herpesvirus (NV1066) expressing green fluorescent protein also demonstrated viral transit from the auricle to the cervical lymph nodes on fluorescence microscopy. Using the SCC VII cell line, a novel murine model of auricular squamous cell carcinoma was developed with an approximately 20% incidence of cervical lymph node metastases. Delivery of NV1023 or NV1066 to the surgical beds after excision of auricular SCC VII tumors resulted in successful viral infection of metastatic SCC VII cells within the cervical lymph nodes. After a 7-week follow-up, significantly enhanced locoregional control (p < 0.05, Fisher exact test) and disease-free survival (p < 0.05, log rank test) were evident with NV1023 treatment.

The human papilloma virus E7 oncoprotein inhibits transforming growth factor-beta signaling by blocking binding of the Smad complex to its target sequence.,The Journal of biological chemistry,J. Biol. Chem.,2002-07-26,"The human papillomavirus (HPV) oncoprotein E7 is implicated in the etiology of cervical cancer associated with infection by HPV. HPV-positive cells develop resistance to TGF-beta growth inhibitory activity through the inhibition of hypophosphorylation of pRb by papillomavirus type 16 E7 oncoprotein. In this study, we examined whether E7, in addition to its well known effects on pRb, might directly target the Smad proteins that mediate TGF-beta signaling. Here, we show that E7 significantly blocks both Smad transcriptional activity and the ability of TGF-beta to inhibit DNA synthesis.

Cytologic and biopsy findings leading to conization in adenocarcinoma in situ of the cervix.,Obstetrics and gynecology,Obstet Gynecol,2002-08-01,"To investigate the utility of currently available screening tests in preoperatively detecting adenocarcinoma in situ of the cervix. Patients with a cone biopsy diagnosis of adenocarcinoma in situ from 1987 to 2000 at our institution were identified. Results from Papanicolaou smears, cervical biopsies, and endocervical curettages preceding the diagnostic cone biopsy were collected from medical records and referring providers. Fisher exact test (two-tail) was used for statistical analysis. The preoperative screening results preceding a cone biopsy containing adenocarcinoma in situ were available in 118 patients. Among 94 Papanicolaou smears, 65 (69%) glandular lesions and 29 (31%) squamous or unspecified lesions were reported. Biopsy and/or endocervical curettage after the 29 squamous or unspecified lesions on Papanicolaou smear detected 15 additional glandular lesions, totaling 80 (85%) of 94 cases of glandular disease detected before conization. Among all 118 cases with some form of preoperative data available, glandular disease was predicted in 100 cases (85%). In cases of suspected glandular disease, 86% were treated with cold knife cone compared with 22% in cases of suspected squamous abnormalities (P <.001).

Forty women, who were at least 18 years old with persistent biopsy-proven CIN 2 and CIN 3 within the previous 3 months of enrollment, underwent PDT in a phase I and II design. Five escalating radiant energies (increments of 25 J/cm(2), beginning at 50-150 J/cm(2)) using a Coherent Dye Model 920 argon pumped dye laser providing light at 630 nm (maximum output 0.8 W) were used to perform PDT with a fixed dose of ALA (200 mg/ml). ALA was placed in a cervical cap fitted to the cervix. After 90 minutes, the cap was removed and the ectocervix was illuminated for 5-16 minutes, depending on the irradiance. Success was defined as the absence of CIN on Pap smear or colposcopic examination at 12-months. Patients were monitored for toxicity. Thirty-two women (80%) completed the study with 1 year of follow-up. Sixty percent had CIN 3 and 40% CIN 2. Success rates at 4, 8, and 12 months were 51, 46, and 31%, respectively, and were not light-dose dependent. Three patients progressed from CIN 2 to CIN 3.

Recurrent or persistent hyperparathyroidism.,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,J. Bone Miner. Res.,2002-11-01,"Approximately 90% of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) are cured by parathyroidectomy at the initial neck exploration. Those not cured either remain hypercalcemic in the immediate postoperative period or develop hypercalcemia after a long period of normocalcemia. Almost all cases of hypercalcemia after neck exploration for PHPT are evident early in the postoperative period and are caused either by an overlooked parathyroid adenoma or an incomplete resection of hyperplastic parathyroid tissue. Less commonly, the surgeon has failed to recognize, and adequately treat, parathyroid carcinoma, or the diagnosis of PHPT was incorrect and there is another cause of the hypercalcemia. A successful neck exploration for PHPT is primarily dependent on the experience of the operating surgeon, the anatomic location of the parathyroid glands, either in ""normal"" or ""ectopic"" sites, and the presence of a single enlarged parathyroid gland as opposed to multiglandular disease or parathyroid carcinoma. In cases where an enlarged parathyroid gland is not identified at operation, noninvasive or invasive radiographic imaging procedures are useful in localizing the gland. Currently, the most reliable and practical procedure is technetium 99m sestamibi scanning. This technique identifies an enlarged parathyroid gland in 65-80% of cases. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in association with sestamibi scanning increases the sensitivity of the procedure to 85%. These imaging procedures are least reliable in patients with multiglandular disease. Ultrasound and computed tomographic scanning are less sensitive; however, they are commonly used as confirmatory tests in association with sestamibi scanning. When noninvasive imaging procedures fail to identify an enlarged parathyroid gland, invasive procedures, such as selective arteriography, are performed. Whereas invasive procedures are useful, they are associated with significant morbidity. Reoperations for persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism, compared with the initial operations, are associated with higher complication rates. In 90% of cases, the abnormal pathology can be reached through a cervical incision. The success rate of the reoperation depends primarily on the results of the localization procedure and whether the patient has a single enlarged parathyroid gland or multiglandular disease.

Retrospective study. Tertiary referral cancer center. Consecutive patients who underwent comprehensive neck dissection with or without concurrent thyroidectomy for well-differentiated thyroid cancer between 1991 and 2001. Excluded were patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer diagnosed incidentally at the time of treatment of other primary head and neck cancer, those with previous neck dissection for nonthyroid malignancies, and those undergoing surgery for medullary thyroid cancer. All pathology and operative and preoperative radiology reports for patients undergoing comprehensive neck dissection for well-differentiated thyroid malignancy were reviewed. Data were collected on previous procedures, preoperative evaluation, operative details, and pathologic findings. Identification of metastatic thyroid cancer in one or more nodes in anatomically defined drainage basins of the central and lateral neck. A total of 51 neck dissections were performed. All patients had preoperative evidence of metastatic disease. In addition to the usual comprehensive node dissection encompassing all lymphatic tissue in levels II through V, level I nodes and level II nodes above the spinal accessory nerve were labeled as distinct regions in 16 (31%) and 34 (67%) specimens, respectively. Disease was confined to a single nodal level in 20 (39%) of 51 specimens and was present in 4 or more levels in 7 (14%) of 50 neck dissections. There was cancer at 2 or 3 levels in 16 (31%) and 15 (29%) cases, respectively. Seven (21%) of the 34 patients undergoing separate analysis of nodes from above the spinal accessory nerve had cancer there. In 3 of the 34 it was the sole disease in level II.

Before large loop excision of the transformation zone, women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia underwent a transepithelial brush biopsy of a portion of a colposcopically identified lesion, followed by a punch biopsy of the remaining portion. Brush biopsy samples were processed using liquid-based cytology and cell block techniques. Diagnoses were made using a consensus of three pathologists. Brush biopsy samples without basal cells were considered inadequate. The histological diagnosis was compared with the brush biopsy and punch biopsy samples. Patient-reported pain and physician-reported bleeding for punch and brush biopsies were compared. Fifty-two women were enrolled in the study; 47 successfully completed the study protocol. Eight brush biopsy specimens were inadequate. Thirty-nine women showed abnormal pathology (human papillomavirus/cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I or worse) on large loop excision of the transformation zone, and 32 women had high-grade (or worse) lesions. The punch biopsy correlated with high-grade disease in 53.1% of these women. The brush biopsy result correlated with high-grade disease in 79.3% of these women using a cell block technique and 76.7% using liquid cytology. There was significantly less pain (P <.001) and significantly less bleeding (P <.001) with the brush biopsy.

Endocervical curettage at conization to predict residual cervical adenocarcinoma in situ.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2002-10-01,"To determine if performing an endocervical curettage (ECC) at the time of conization is a useful diagnostic tool for predicting residual cervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) among women who might wish to preserve their fertility. All patients diagnosed with AIS from 1995 to 2000 at four institutions were identified. Data were retrospectively extracted from clinical records. Women included in the statistical analysis were (1) younger than 40 years, (2) had an ECC performed at the time of the initial cone biopsy, (3) had a clearly demarcated surgical margin pathologically, and (4) underwent a second surgical procedure. Twenty-nine (24%) of 123 AIS patients met criteria for inclusion. The median age was 33 years (range, 17 to 39) and 13 (46%) were nulliparous. Initial surgery was a cold-knife conization (n = 17) or loop electrosurgical excision procedure (n = 12). Twelve (41%) ECCs and 15 (52%) cone margins were histologically positive. Sixteen patients underwent a repeat conization; 13 underwent hysterectomy. Thirteen (45%) patients had residual AIS at the time of their second surgical procedure.

Development of an in vitro chemo-radiation response assay for cervical carcinoma.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2002-11-01,"To determine if synergistic effects of radiation (RT) and chemotherapy (chemo) on human cervical carcinoma cell lines and fresh tumor explants could be determined using an in vitro assay. In vitro radiation response was determined for 4 cell lines and 26 fresh tumor explants in an agar-based assay. Cells were exposed to increasing doses of RT with or without cisplatin (CDDP), carmustine (BCNU), buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), or paclitaxel (Tax). Cell suspensions were cultured for 5 days, with [(3)H]thymidine added on day 3 and proliferation was measured. Results were reported as the fraction of proliferation compared to control (FC). For each combination of irradiation and drug, synergy was tested using the Chou analysis, where a combination index (CI) <1 indicated synergistic interaction. In simple correlation analysis, an R value of >0.7 indicated cross-resistance. RT dose-dependent proliferation inhibition was observed for 2 of the 4 cell lines, and for all but 1 of the fresh specimens. Significant heterogeneity of tumor response to RT was seen. Four specimens that were 1 standard deviation below the median FC response after exposure to 300 cGy were classified as extremely radiation resistant. Twenty-one tumors were evaluated for synergistic response using the combination of chemo and RT with a median FC of 0.27 (+/-0.27) for 6.0 Gy of RT alone, 0.22 (+/-0.21) for CDDP alone, and 0.05 (+/-0.08) for the combination. A CI of 0.35 and an R value of 0.09 demonstrated synergy between chemo and RT without cross-resistance. Similar synergy without cross-resistance was found for RT in combination with BCNU, BSO, and TAX. Heterogeneous RT dose-response relationships in the in vitro assay were demonstrated. Explants were more sensitive to RT than cell lines. Unlike cell lines, fresh tumor cells consistently displayed synergy with RT and chemo. The synergy between RT and BSO suggests that glutathione depletion may enhance the effect of RT. The assay was feasible for examining fresh tumors and may be an important tool for studying RT or drug resistance. Clinical trials to evaluate this assay are indicated.",Journal Article,6290.0,9.0,To determine if synergistic effects of radiation RT and chemotherapy chemo on human carcinoma cell lines and fresh tumor explants could be determined using an in vitro assay In vitro radiation response was determined for 4 cell lines and 26 fresh tumor explants in an agar-based assay Cells were exposed to increasing doses of RT with or without cisplatin CDDP carmustine BCNU buthionine sulfoximine BSO or paclitaxel Tax Cell suspensions were cultured for 5 days with 3 H thymidine added on day 3 and proliferation was measured Results were reported as the fraction of proliferation compared to control FC For each combination of irradiation and drug synergy was tested using the Chou analysis where a combination index CI 1 indicated synergistic interaction In simple correlation analysis an R value of 0.7 indicated cross-resistance RT dose-dependent proliferation inhibition was observed for 2 of the 4 cell lines and for all but 1 of the fresh specimens Significant heterogeneity of tumor response to RT was seen Four specimens that were 1 standard deviation below the median FC response after exposure to 300 cGy were classified as extremely radiation resistant Twenty-one tumors were evaluated for synergistic response using the combination of chemo and RT with a median FC of 0.27 +/-0.27 for 6.0 Gy of RT alone 0.22 +/-0.21 for CDDP alone and 0.05 +/-0.08 for the combination A CI of 0.35 and an R value of 0.09 demonstrated synergy between chemo and RT without cross-resistance Similar synergy without cross-resistance was found for RT in combination with BCNU BSO and TAX Heterogeneous RT dose-response relationships in the in vitro assay were demonstrated Explants were more sensitive to RT than cell lines Unlike cell lines fresh tumor cells consistently displayed synergy with RT and chemo The synergy between RT and BSO suggests that glutathione depletion may enhance the effect of RT The assay was feasible for examining fresh tumors and may be an important tool for studying RT or drug resistance Clinical trials to evaluate this assay are indicated,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[6, 223, 492, 1806, 176, 1, 121, 240, 2, 56, 3341, 23, 171, 134, 31, 285, 2, 4329, 30, 9774, 359, 40, 509, 75, 35, 4, 439, 719, 4, 439, 121, 51, 10, 509, 9, 39, 31, 285, 2, 432, 4329, 30, 9774, 4, 35, 7491, 90, 719, 37, 11, 2234, 6, 602, 415, 1, 240, 5, 15, 187, 540, 5820, 5818, 4146, 24554, 24555, 9477, 15, 490, 8667, 31, 18240, 11, 3197, 9, 33, 162, 5, 27, 555, 6403, 1953, 23, 218, 27, 2, 457, 10, 644, 99, 11, 210, 22, 3, 1509, 1, 457, 72, 6, 182, 4127, 9, 296, 150, 1, 1104, 2, 234, 3439, 10, 650, 75, 3, 19520, 65, 1257, 8, 150, 558, 58, 14, 1103, 1806, 915, 4, 2763, 816, 65, 35, 668, 549, 1, 13, 67, 1103, 1383, 251, 240, 61, 470, 457, 297, 10, 164, 9, 18, 1, 3, 39, 31, 285, 2, 9, 62, 84, 14, 1, 3, 4329, 623, 93, 1144, 1, 30, 51, 6, 240, 10, 527, 294, 623, 17, 11, 14, 260, 3348, 2736, 3, 52, 4127, 51, 50, 645, 6, 2036, 3071, 11, 1373, 22, 2938, 121, 436, 737, 104, 57, 11, 194, 9, 1806, 51, 75, 3, 150, 1, 3341, 2, 240, 5, 8, 52, 4127, 1, 13, 428, 13, 428, 9, 49, 13, 381, 1, 240, 279, 13, 350, 13, 239, 9, 5820, 279, 2, 13, 474, 13, 1592, 9, 3, 150, 8, 58, 1, 13, 465, 2, 35, 668, 549, 1, 13, 1730, 264, 3439, 59, 3341, 2, 240, 187, 1383, 251, 288, 3439, 187, 1383, 251, 10, 204, 9, 240, 4, 150, 5, 4146, 9477, 2, 8667, 1564, 240, 61, 51, 2467, 4, 3, 4, 439, 719, 11, 264, 9774, 11, 80, 745, 6, 240, 76, 31, 285, 4246, 31, 285, 4329, 30, 37, 2433, 2507, 3439, 5, 240, 2, 3341, 3, 3439, 59, 240, 2, 9477, 844, 17, 4571, 2286, 68, 1304, 3, 254, 1, 240, 3, 719, 10, 1313, 9, 3282, 4329, 57, 2, 68, 40, 35, 305, 1515, 9, 4559, 240, 15, 234, 251, 38, 143, 6, 376, 26, 719, 32, 1103]",2066.0,12477451,869

North Am.,2002-12-01,"Cervical cancer is a preventable disease that is curable when it is detected early. For advanced-stage cancer, the prognosis is worse. Over the years, much progress has been made in radiation therapy and in chemotherapy, but it took three decades for the arrival of concurrent chemoradiation therapy, which significantly improved the survival among women with advanced cervical cancer.

Prognostic factors in neuroendocrine small cell cervical carcinoma: a multivariate analysis.,Cancer,Cancer,2003-02-01,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and pathologic factors associated with survival in patients with neuroendocrine (NE) cervical carcinoma. All patients with NE cervical carcinoma diagnosed between 1979-2001 were identified from tumor registry databases at two hospitals. Data were collected from hospital charts, office records, and tumor registry files. The impact of clinical and pathologic risk factors on the survival of patients with small cell NE carcinoma of the cervix was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier life table analyses and log-rank tests. The independent prognostic factors found to be predictive of survival in univariate analysis were evaluated using Cox regression. All tests were two-tailed with P values < 0.05 considered significant. Thirty-four patients (median age, 42 years) were diagnosed with neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma, which included 21 with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Stage I disease, 6 with FIGO Stage II disease, 5 with FIGO Stage III disease, and 2 with FIGO Stage IV disease. Seventeen patients underwent a radical and 6 patients underwent a simple hysterectomy. Fourteen women received adjuvant therapy with pelvic radiation and/or cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Ten women received primary radiotherapy with (n = 5) or without (n = 4) chemotherapy and the remaining patient refused therapy. Women with early-stage (Stage I-IIA) disease had median survival rates of 31 months compared with 10 months in the advanced-stage (Stage IIB-IVB) group (P = 0.002). In univariate analysis, advanced stage (P = 0.002), tumor size >2 cm (P = 0.02), margin involvement (P = 0.016), pure versus a mixed histologic pattern (P = 0.04), margin status (P = 0.016), and smoking (P = 0.04) were considered poor prognostic factors. In multivariate analysis, smoking for early-stage patients and stage of disease in the overall population remained as independent prognostic factors of survival. Smoking and advanced stage are reported to be poor prognostic factors for survival in patients with NE small cell carcinoma of the cervix. Only those with early lesions amenable to extirpation are cured. The role of primary or postoperative radiation with or without chemotherapy is unclear and yields uniformly poor results, particularly in patients with advanced lesions.

Cervical cancer rates and the supply of primary care physicians in Florida.,Family medicine,Fam Med,2003-01-01,"This study's aim was to determine if an increased supply of primary care physicians is associated with lower incidence and mortality rates for cervical cancer. We determined cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates for each of Florida's 67 counties over the 3-year period of 1993-1995 using data from Florida's population-based tumor registry. Data on physician supply were obtained from the 1994 American Medical Association Physician Masterfile. We used multiple linear regression analysis to examine the relationship between physician supply and cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates, adjusting for other county-level characteristics. In regression analysis that adjusted for other county-level characteristics, each increase in the supply of family physicians of one physician/10,000 persons was associated with a corresponding drop in the incidence rate of 1.5 cases/100,000 persons and a corresponding drop in mortality rate of .65 cases/100,000 persons.

In particular, the distinction between gross nodal extracapsular spread of tumor and microscopic nodal extracapsular spread of tumor has been drawn in recent reports; this raises the possibility that identification of microscopic breaching of the nodc capsule by tumor might provide clinically significant information which is not provided by the gross observation of an intact lymph node capsule.

A pilot study was conducted to examine the feasibility, safety and potential efficacy of intravaginal DHEA in women with low-grade cervical dysplasia. Twelve women with low-grade dysplasia, confirmed by colposcopic exam, were given 150 mg of intravaginal micronized DHEA daily for up to 6 months. Follow-up evaluations of the cervix were done at 3 and 6 months of use. DHEA, DHEA-S, androstenedione and testosterone levels were also measured. By the end of the study period, 10 of the 12 women (83%) had no evidence of dysplasia; the remaining 2 had normal colposcopic exams but cytology showing atypical cells of undetermined significance. There were no serious side effects. Androstenedione levels were elevated at 3 months, whereas testosterone levels were unchanged over the course of treatment.

Adjuvant irradiation for cervical lymph node metastases from melanoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2003-04-01,"The risk of regional disease recurrence after surgery alone for lymph node metastases from melanoma is well documented. The role of adjuvant irradiation remains controversial. The medical records of 160 patients with cervical lymph node metastases from melanoma were reviewed retrospectively. Of these, 148 (93%) presented with clinically palpable lymph node metastases. All patients underwent surgery and radiation to a median dose of 30 grays (Gy) at 6 Gy per fraction delivered twice weekly. Surgical resection was either a selective neck dissection in 90 patients or local excision of the lymph node metastasis in 35 patients. Only 35 patients underwent a radical, modified radical, or functional neck dissection. At a median follow-up of 78 months, the actuarial local, regional, and locoregional control rates at 10 years were 94%, 94%, and 91%, respectively. Univariate analysis of patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics failed to reveal any association with the subsequent rate of local or regional control. The actuarial disease-specific (DSS), disease-free, and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) rates at 10 years were 48%, 42%, and 43%, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that patients with four or more involved lymph nodes had a significantly worse DSS and DMFS. Nine patients developed a treatment-related complication requiring medical management, resulting in a 5-year actuarial complication-free survival rate of 90%. Adjuvant radiotherapy resulted in a 10-year regional control rate of 94%. Complications for all patients were rare and manageable when they did occur.

Between April 2001 and March 2002 a total of 12 patients underwent laparoscopic bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy (squamous carcinoma in 10 cases, all stage FIGO IB1, and adenocarcinoma in 2 cases, stages IA2 and IB1). Lymphoscintigraphies were performed on the day before surgery to visualize sentinel lymph nodes, 31 +/- 22.5 and 174 +/- 34 min after injection of 200 microCi of technetium 99m rhenium sulfur colloid. The marker was injected at the 3, 6, 9, and 12 o'clock positions. The day of surgery 2 ml of patent blue dye plus 2 ml of physiological serum was injected in the cervix, at the same locations as the radioactive isotope injection. A total of 35 sentinel lymph nodes were detected. Eight sentinel lymph nodes were only detected by color, 8 sentinel lymph nodes were only detected by the endoscopic gamma probe, and 19 sentinel lymph nodes were ""hot and dyed."" We found 3 metastatic lymph nodes. In one case, bilateral positive sentinel nodes were only detected by the endoscopic gamma probe. Permanent section identified one inframillimetric micrometastasis in a lymph node that was neither blue nor hot intraoperatively (sensitivity = 66%, specificity = 100%, positive predictive value = 100%, negative predictive value = 90%). The identification of the sentinel lymph node with blue dye and radioisotope using an endoscopic gamma probe is feasible and improves detection rate.

Patient variables assessed included age, insurance status, cancer diagnosis, and enrollment onto clinical trial. There was no difference in faculty patients with regard to cancer type, age, or insurance status.

Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of enhanced Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase mutants improves prodrug-mediated tumor cell killing.,Cancer gene therapy,Cancer Gene Ther.,2003-05-01,"The Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV) thymidine kinase (tk) suicide gene together with ganciclovir (GCV) have been successfully used for the in vivo treatment of various solid tumors and for the ablation of unwanted transfused stem cells in recent clinical trials. With the aim of improving this therapeutic system, we compared the potential efficacy of adenoviral (Ad) vectors expressing enhanced tk mutants in vitro and in vivo. The previously created HSV-tk mutants dm30 and sr39, created by random sequence mutagenesis, were inserted into a standard Ad.RSV E1(-)E3(-) backbone using homologous recombination. GCV killing of Ad.HSV-tk, Ad.dm30-tk and Ad.sr39-tk was assessed in various tumor cell lines with a cell proliferation assay.

Twenty-one patients received BMS-247550 without filgrastim in the first cycle. An additional six patients were enrolled at a starting dose of 8 mg/m2/d with filgrastim support. Twenty-one of the 27 patients had received prior paclitaxel, docetaxel, or both. One hundred seven cycles were administered to 27 patients. The maximum-tolerated dose was 6 mg/m2 of BMS-247550 administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion daily for 5 consecutive days every 21 days. Dose-limiting toxicity at a dose of 8 mg/m2/d was neutropenia with or without filgrastim support. Nonhematologic grade 3 toxicities included fatigue (seven cycles), stomatitis (two cycles), and anorexia (one cycle).

Development of endometrial cancer after radiation treatment for cervical carcinoma.,Obstetrics and gynecology,Obstet Gynecol,2003-05-01,"To detail the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and MD Anderson Cancer Center experience with 23 patients treated with radiation therapy for invasive cervical carcinoma who subsequently developed endometrial carcinoma. We conducted a retrospective chart and pathology review on patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer between 1976 and 2000 who had previously received definitive radiation treatment for cervical cancer. Abstracted data included patient demographics, type of radiation therapy, histological grade, histological subtype, and stage of endometrial cancer. The mean age at endometrial cancer diagnosis was 64.4 years (range 53-80), and the average latency period from initial therapy to development of endometrial carcinoma was 14 years (range 6-27). Distribution by stage, grade, and histology was as follows: stage I, five (22%); stage II, one (4%); stage III, nine (39%); stage IV, seven (30%); unknown stage, one (4%); grade 1, one (4%); grade 2, three (13%); grade 3, 17 (74%); unknown grade, two (9%); carcinosarcoma, eight (35%); endometrioid, four (17%); papillary serous, six (26%); clear cell, one (4%); mucinous, one (4%); undifferentiated, one (4%); and unknown histology, two (9%).

A phase I and pharmacologic study of pyrazoloacridine and cisplatin in patients with advanced cancer.,Investigational new drugs,Invest New Drugs,2003-02-01,"Pyrazoloacridine (PZA, NSC366140, PD115934) is an acridine derivative currently undergoing clinical evaluation. In preclinical testing, PZA has shown selectivity for solid tumor cell lines, activity in hypoxic, noncycling, and multidrug-resistant cell lines, and synergy with cisplatin in a variety of lung cancer cell lines. In early phase I clinical studies PZA has shown modest activity in ovarian, cervical, and colon cancer. The purpose of the present study was threefold: to determine the maximally tolerated doses of the combination of PZA (3-h infusion) and cisplatin administered with and without Filgrastim (G-CSF) (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA) every 3 weeks in untreated or minimally pretreated patients, to describe and quantify the clinical toxicities of combination chemotherapy with PZA and cisplatin, and to evaluate the effects of drug sequencing on the toxicity profile and pharmacologic behavior of PZA. The starting doses in this dose-escalation trial were PZA 400 mg/m2 as a 3-h intravenous infusion and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 as a 1 mg/min intravenous infusion. The sequence of drugs was alternated with each successive course in each patient treated. Twenty-one patients with refractory solid tumors received 43 courses of therapy through four dose levels. Neutropenia was dose-limiting and defined the maximum tolerated dose of PZA 400 mg/m2 and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 without G-CSF support. With G-CSF support, nausea and vomiting were dose-limiting. The maximum tolerated and recommended doses for further study of this combination are PZA 600 mg/m2 over 3 h and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 followed by G-CSF support.

The role of novel oncogenes squamous cell carcinoma-related oncogene and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p110alpha in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2003-06-01,"Amplification at chromosome 3q26.3 is a common and crucial event in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), impacting significantly on tumor progression and clinical outcome. Two novel oncogenes, namely squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)-related oncogene (SCCRO) and PIK3CA (gene encoding phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase catalytic alpha-polypeptide), have been identified as targets of 3q26.3 amplification. This study aimed to delineate the role of SCCRO and PIK3CA in the pathogenesis of oral tongue SCC. The association between gene copy number for SCCRO and PIK3CA measured by fluorescence in situ hybridization and level of mRNA expression quantitated by real-time reverse transcription-PCR was assessed in a panel of human HNSCC cell lines. In addition, gene expression in 49 consecutive primary SCCs of the oral tongue was determined and correlated with clinicopathological characteristics and outcome. The mRNA level of SCCRO and PIK3CA was significantly correlated to the gene copy number in nine HNSCC cell lines. In addition, the expression level of SCCRO and PIK3CA was significantly greater in malignant tissues compared with those in histologically normal mucosae (2.17- and 2.46-fold, respectively; P < 0.001). Matched tumor normal control analysis revealed that 24.5 and 69.4% of patients expressed high levels of SCCRO and PIK3CA, respectively. Univariate analyses demonstrated that SCCRO overexpression correlated with nodal metastases (P = 0.05) and advanced stage (P = 0.02), whereas PIK3CA overexpression was associated with vascular invasion (P = 0.04).

The use of MRI in the diagnosis and management of a bulky cervical carcinoma.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2003-06-01,"In the treatment of gynecologic cancer, surgical planning depends on the site and extent of disease. The evaluation of the origin of a large pelvic mass with combined pelvic examination and ultrasound is often adequate. However, the following case report illustrates the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) when sonographic findings are indeterminate and the origin of a pelvic mass is unclear. A 73-year-old woman presented for her first gynecologic exam in over 40 years. On speculum examination the cervix was not visible. A large, mobile pelvic mass was palpated during physical examination. Pelvic ultrasound revealed a large, cystic pelvic mass thought to be ovarian in origin. Surgery for presumed ovarian carcinoma was planned. Because a vaginal Pap smear revealed squamous-cell carcinoma, MRI was performed for further evaluation. MRI demonstrated a blood distended uterus with a large cervical tumor obstructing the endocervical os. After cervical dilatation under sonographic guidance, evacuation of the hematometrium was performed. Multiple biopsies of the cervix confirmed the diagnosis of a bulky Stage IIA squamous-cell carcinoma of the cervix. The patient was subsequently treated with concomitant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Follow-up MRI demonstrated an excellent treatment response. Modified radical hysterectomy was performed demonstrating very small residual tumor.

Acquisition of anoikis resistance is a critical step in the progression of oral tongue cancer.,Oral oncology,Oral Oncol.,2003-10-01,"We hypothesized that acquisition of resistance to anoikis is a critical step in oral cancer progression. To test this hypothesis, we compared a panel of cell lines derived from human oral tissues across the spectrum of tumor progression from oral keratinocytes (HOK-16B), invasive oral squamous cell carcinoma (Tu167), and finally metastatic carcinoma (TxCS-1, MDA1986) for their sensitivity to detachment from the extracellular matrix. The relationship between stage of tumor progression and anoikis resistance was demonstrated by the apoptotic fractions after 48 h in suspension culture which were 93.33, 61.6, 34.5, and 3.71%, respectively. To further demonstrate that anoikis resistance is important for tumor progression, we selected a highly anoikis resistant cell line, JMAR, by serial passage of the Tu167 cell line in suspension culture. Initially, the JMAR line, and clones derived from it, were characterized for anoikis resistance in vitro, and after 72 h in suspension culture the rates of anoikis in the Tu167 and JMAR lines were found to be 73 and 26%, respectively. The degree of anoikis resistance was found to correlate with survival of nude mice orthotopically injected with 5x10(5) Tu167 or JMAR cells. The JMAR mice had a median survival of 17 days versus over 30 days in mice implanted with the Tu167 line. Finally, we found that in vivo selection in the orthotopic model for a regionally metastatic cell line by implantation of Tu167 into the tongues of nude mice and harvesting and culturing cervical lymph nodes led to production of a cell line, Tu167LN1, which was found to be anoikis-resistant. This cell line had an apoptotic cell fraction of 16.2% (+/-3.14%) after 48 h in suspension culture.",Journal Article,5956.0,40.0,We hypothesized that acquisition of resistance to anoikis is a critical step in oral cancer progression To test this hypothesis we compared a panel of cell lines derived from human oral tissues across the spectrum of tumor progression from oral keratinocytes HOK-16B invasive oral squamous cell carcinoma Tu167 and finally metastatic carcinoma TxCS-1 MDA1986 for their sensitivity to detachment from the extracellular matrix The relationship between stage of tumor progression and anoikis resistance was demonstrated by the apoptotic fractions after 48 h in suspension culture which were 93.33 61.6 34.5 and 3.71 respectively To further demonstrate that anoikis resistance is important for tumor progression we selected a highly anoikis resistant cell line JMAR by serial passage of the Tu167 cell line in suspension culture Initially the JMAR line and clones derived from it were characterized for anoikis resistance in vitro and after 72 h in suspension culture the rates of anoikis in the Tu167 and JMAR lines were found to be 73 and 26 respectively The degree of anoikis resistance was found to correlate with survival of nude mice orthotopically injected with 5x10 5 Tu167 or JMAR cells The JMAR mice had a median survival of 17 days versus over 30 days in mice implanted with the Tu167 line Finally we found that in vivo selection in the orthotopic model for a regionally metastatic cell line by implantation of Tu167 into the tongues of nude mice and harvesting and culturing lymph nodes led to production of a cell line Tu167LN1 which was found to be anoikis-resistant This cell line had an apoptotic cell fraction of 16.2 +/-3.14 after 48 h in suspension culture,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[21, 1237, 17, 3405, 1, 251, 6, 7817, 16, 8, 740, 2458, 4, 518, 12, 91, 6, 412, 26, 1492, 21, 72, 8, 993, 1, 31, 285, 526, 29, 171, 518, 742, 716, 3, 1873, 1, 30, 91, 29, 518, 9587, 53679, 43331, 416, 518, 691, 31, 134, 20990, 2, 1368, 113, 134, 53680, 14, 23073, 9, 136, 485, 6, 13252, 29, 3, 1976, 2248, 3, 858, 59, 82, 1, 30, 91, 2, 7817, 251, 10, 264, 20, 3, 1631, 1550, 50, 576, 555, 4, 9348, 2099, 92, 11, 966, 466, 713, 49, 562, 33, 2, 27, 792, 106, 6, 195, 608, 17, 7817, 251, 16, 305, 9, 30, 91, 21, 715, 8, 561, 7817, 436, 31, 328, 20314, 20, 2108, 7740, 1, 3, 20990, 31, 328, 4, 9348, 2099, 1625, 3, 20314, 328, 2, 2749, 526, 29, 192, 11, 765, 9, 7817, 251, 4, 439, 2, 50, 720, 555, 4, 9348, 2099, 3, 151, 1, 7817, 4, 3, 20990, 2, 20314, 285, 11, 204, 6, 40, 803, 2, 432, 106, 3, 1444, 1, 7817, 251, 10, 204, 6, 1513, 5, 25, 1, 2598, 399, 10806, 2651, 5, 24632, 33, 20990, 15, 20314, 37, 3, 20314, 399, 42, 8, 52, 25, 1, 269, 162, 185, 252, 201, 162, 4, 399, 3416, 5, 3, 20990, 328, 1368, 21, 204, 17, 4, 386, 881, 4, 3, 2157, 202, 9, 8, 8183, 113, 31, 328, 20, 4314, 1, 20990, 237, 3, 23074, 1, 2598, 399, 2, 17700, 2, 16316, 263, 502, 836, 6, 1529, 1, 8, 31, 328, 53681, 92, 10, 204, 6, 40, 7817, 436, 26, 31, 328, 42, 35, 1631, 31, 1509, 1, 245, 18, 27, 213, 50, 576, 555, 4, 9348, 2099]",1671.0,12907203,227
Radiotherapy in the management of giant cell tumor of bone.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2003-09-01,"To evaluate the outcomes of patients with giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) treated with radiotherapy (RT) with or without surgical resection. We performed a retrospective review of the records from 25 consecutive patients with pathologically confirmed GCTB who had undergone RT between 1956 and 2000. Patients ranged in age from 11 to 69 years (median 32); 16 were female and 9 were male. The anatomic distribution of lesions was as follows: cervical spine, 3; temporal bone, 1; thoracic or lumbar spine, 9; sacrum, 8; ilium, 1, and humerus, radius, and thumb metacarpal, 1 each. Tumors ranged in size from 2 to 20 cm (median 9.5) at their maximal dimension. Thirteen patients had been referred for RT for primary GCTB and 12 had been referred with locally recurrent disease after having undergone one or more other treatments. Fourteen patients had undergone RT for gross disease, and the remaining 11 had been treated with RT after gross total resection. In 10 of these 11 patients, the treatment margins were positive or uncertain. Radiation doses ranged from 25 to 65 Gy (median 46). At a median follow-up of 8.8 years (range 0.67-34), 7 patients had developed isolated local recurrence, 2 had developed isolated distant recurrence, and 3 had developed both. The actuarial 5-year overall and disease-free survival rate was 91% and 58%, respectively, and the actuarial 5-year local control and distant metastasis-free survival rate was 62% and 81%, respectively. Univariate analysis suggested that treatment for recurrent disease correlated with a lower disease-free survival rate (83% vs. 33%, p = 0.06), distant metastasis-free survival rate (100% vs. 64%, p = 0.08), and local control rate (83% vs. 42%, p = 0.08) at 5 years. Of the 12 cases of recurrence, 7 were ultimately successfully treated with additional salvage therapy. In 4 of these patients, salvage therapy included interferon-alpha 2b.

Early stage cervical cancers containing human papillomavirus type 18 DNA have more nodal metastasis and deeper stromal invasion.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2003-09-01,"To investigate the clinical and pathological factors which might explain the poor prognosis associated with early stage cervical cancers containing human papillomavirus (HPV) type 18 DNA. A clinical and pathological review of 144 patients with stage IB cervical cancer treated with radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection was done. HPV genotyping was determined from fresh tumor specimens through PCR. Clinical-pathological information, sites of recurrence, use of adjuvant radiation, and survival data were analyzed. Thirty-three (23%) tumors contained HPV 18 DNA. These tumors did not differ from those which contained non-HPV 18 DNA with respect to tumor grade or size. However, HPV 18-containing cancers were more likely to be adenocarcinomas. A higher incidence of pelvic lymph node metastasis was noted among the HPV 18 group (48%) as compared with the non-HPV 18 group (28%), and deeper stromal invasion was more common in HPV 18-associated tumors. Although a slightly higher proportion of patients with HPV 18-containing tumors received adjuvant radiation (67%) than those with non-HPV 18 cancers (49%), recurrences were more common among HPV 18 patients. Eleven (33%) of HPV 18-containing cancers relapsed compared with 18 (16%) of non-HPV18-containing tumors. The explanation for the worse prognosis associated with stage IB cervical cancers containing HPV 18 DNA treated with radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection appears to be related to deeper cervical stromal invasion and more nodal metastases.

The hazard ratio (HR) for invasive ovarian cancer in women assigned to estrogen plus progestin compared with placebo was 1.58 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-3.24). The HR for endometrial cancer was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.48-1.36). No appreciable differences were found in the distributions of tumor histology, stage, or grade for either cancer site. The incidence of other gynecologic cancers was low and did not differ by randomization assignment. More women taking estrogen plus progestin required endometrial biopsies (33% vs 6%; P<.001). This randomized trial suggests that continuous combined estrogen plus progestin therapy may increase the risk of ovarian cancer while producing endometrial cancer rates similar to placebo.

Comparison was made to a cohort of 195 patients who were treated with laparotomy. Between 12/2000 and 12/2002, 19 patients were offered the laparoscopic approach. The procedure was completed laparoscopically in 17 patients (89.5%). Two patients, in the beginning of the study, underwent conversion to laparotomy, 1 due to parametrial bleeding and 1 due to pelvic adhesions and cystotomy. Mean age was 42.6 years (range, 30-69 years); mean body mass index was 23.1 (range, 18-30); FIGO stage included IA1 with LVI (2), IA2 (6), IB1 (11). Mean pelvic lymph node count was 25.5 (range, 15-39), and 1 patient (5.3%) had positive nodes. Mean estimated blood loss was 301 cc (range, 75-1500 cc) compared to 693 cc in the laparotomy group (P < 0.01), mean operating time was 371 min (range, 230-600 min) compared to 295 min in the laparotomy group (P < 0.01), and mean hospital stay was 4.5 days (range, 3-11 days) compared to 9.7 days in the laparotomy group (P < 0.01). There were no ureteral injuries or fistula formation. All patients remain clinically disease free at the time of this report. Total laparoscopic radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy for selected patients with stage I cervical cancer is feasible, safe, and associated with a low morbidity in the pilot phase.

Behavioral scientists gathered at the Second International Conference on Cervical Cancer (Houston, TX, April 11-14, 2002) reviewed selected studies of behavioral factors related to cervical cancer, including women's receptivity to emerging cervical cancer screening and diagnostic technologies, factors that influence adherence to follow-up colposcopy recommendations, and cervical cancer survivors' quality of life. Researchers reported that reduced distress during examinations with new technology may improve adherence to cervical cancer screening recommendations. Until new technology becomes mainstream, research shows that distress is reduced and adherence improves when health care providers match interventions to patients' informational processing styles. Investigations of survivors' quality of life report conflicting findings, but studies indicate that survivors experience anger over reproductive loss, loss of interest in sex, and perhaps a greater vulnerability to sexual dysfunction compared with survivors of other cancers.

Imaging in cervical cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2003-11-01,"Cervical cancer traditionally has been staged clinically. Advances in imaging could improve the staging of cervical cancer by facilitating the detection of lymph node metastases and micrometastases in distant organs. Such progress could lead to improvements in treatment selection and therefore increase overall survival rates. At the Second International Conference on Clinical Cancer (Houston, TX, April 11-14, 2002), a panel composed of gynecologic oncologists, radiation oncologists, and diagnostic radiologists reviewed relevant technologies. Advances in lymphangiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and lymphatic mapping were reviewed, along with the impact of these advances on the diagnosis, treatment, and survival of patients with cervical cancer. Few cancer centers still use lymphangiography, but the sensitivity of this method ranges from 28% to 83%, with specificity ranging from 47% to 100%. The roles of transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography in evaluating cervical cancer are expected to expand when new contrast agents increase the sensitivity of these techniques to parametrial invasion and lymph node metastases; meanwhile, ultrasonography's most significant contributions may involve the identification of uterine and cervical leiomyomas and the evaluation of urinary tract obstruction. Advances in CT have made it a rival technique to MRI, but limitations prevent CT from providing definitive information on certain parameters. MRI, which is valuable because of its superior soft tissue contrast resolution, multiplanar capabilities, and cost-effectiveness, is used to determine the size of the cervix and to detect certain types of invasion, characteristics of lymph nodes, and the presence of disease in the ureter, lung, and liver. PET with 2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose has been found to detect abnormal lymph node regions better than CT does but PET can also be used in conjunction with CT to measure tumor dimensions. PET also has become a method for identifying tumors that are unresponsive to chemoradiation. When used together with immunohistochemical and molecular techniques as well as conventional stains, sentinel lymph node mapping, an important development in the surgical management of solid tumors, is expected to improve gynecologic cancer management. Advances in imaging methods and in contrast agents, along with advances in the combined use of the two, are expected to make imaging technologies more valuable in cervical cancer assessment.",Journal Article,5925.0,93.0,cancer traditionally has been staged clinically Advances in imaging could improve the staging of cancer by facilitating the detection of lymph node metastases and micrometastases in distant organs Such progress could lead to improvements in treatment selection and therefore increase overall survival rates At the Second International Conference on Clinical Cancer Houston TX April 11-14 2002 a panel composed of gynecologic oncologists radiation oncologists and diagnostic radiologists reviewed relevant technologies Advances in lymphangiography ultrasonography computed tomography CT magnetic resonance imaging MRI positron emission tomography PET and lymphatic mapping were reviewed along with the impact of these advances on the diagnosis treatment and survival of patients with cancer Few cancer centers still use lymphangiography but the sensitivity of this method ranges from 28 to 83 with specificity ranging from 47 to 100 The roles of transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography in evaluating cancer are expected to expand when new contrast agents increase the sensitivity of these techniques to parametrial invasion and lymph node metastases meanwhile ultrasonography 's most significant contributions may involve the identification of and leiomyomas and the evaluation of urinary tract obstruction Advances in CT have made it a rival technique to MRI but limitations prevent CT from providing definitive information on certain parameters MRI which is valuable because of its superior soft tissue contrast resolution multiplanar capabilities and cost-effectiveness is used to determine the size of the cervix and to detect certain types of invasion characteristics of lymph nodes and the presence of disease in the ureter and PET with 2- fluorine-18 fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose has been found to detect abnormal lymph node regions better than CT does but PET can also be used in conjunction with CT to measure tumor dimensions PET also has become a method for identifying tumors that are unresponsive to chemoradiation When used together with immunohistochemical and molecular techniques as well as conventional stains sentinel lymph node mapping an important development in the surgical management of solid tumors is expected to improve gynecologic cancer management Advances in imaging methods and in contrast agents along with advances in the combined use of the two are expected to make imaging technologies more valuable in cancer assessment,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[12, 4206, 71, 85, 2930, 505, 954, 4, 270, 359, 401, 3, 632, 1, 12, 20, 5379, 3, 638, 1, 263, 289, 196, 2, 5485, 4, 626, 2285, 225, 1466, 359, 1122, 6, 1474, 4, 24, 881, 2, 673, 344, 63, 25, 151, 28, 3, 419, 944, 4180, 23, 38, 12, 6212, 6614, 2292, 175, 213, 1544, 8, 993, 3317, 1, 1512, 1339, 121, 1339, 2, 752, 3915, 446, 867, 2590, 954, 4, 37576, 4244, 1220, 872, 425, 1484, 1535, 270, 704, 1900, 1799, 872, 495, 2, 2936, 2568, 11, 446, 1510, 5, 3, 345, 1, 46, 954, 23, 3, 147, 24, 2, 25, 1, 7, 5, 12, 1021, 12, 1168, 1234, 119, 37576, 84, 3, 485, 1, 26, 596, 5632, 29, 339, 6, 852, 5, 1121, 2223, 29, 662, 6, 394, 3, 1790, 1, 16333, 2, 9487, 4244, 4, 1435, 12, 32, 1336, 6, 4082, 198, 217, 748, 183, 344, 3, 485, 1, 46, 1092, 6, 8726, 578, 2, 263, 289, 196, 8197, 4244, 292, 96, 93, 5621, 68, 3882, 3, 911, 1, 2, 12815, 2, 3, 451, 1, 1660, 1696, 3191, 954, 4, 425, 47, 1229, 192, 8, 43429, 1312, 6, 704, 84, 1939, 1682, 425, 29, 1736, 1057, 487, 23, 1840, 1038, 704, 92, 16, 2926, 408, 1, 211, 1123, 1214, 246, 748, 2125, 17732, 8190, 2, 835, 1236, 16, 95, 6, 223, 3, 444, 1, 3, 3629, 2, 6, 1426, 1840, 630, 1, 578, 374, 1, 263, 502, 2, 3, 463, 1, 34, 4, 3, 9775, 2, 495, 5, 18, 10190, 203, 6231, 18, 6149, 427, 2522, 71, 85, 204, 6, 1426, 1668, 263, 289, 1374, 380, 76, 425, 1097, 84, 495, 122, 120, 40, 95, 4, 3357, 5, 425, 6, 1463, 30, 6190, 495, 120, 71, 1417, 8, 596, 9, 1386, 57, 17, 32, 7244, 6, 975, 198, 95, 1162, 5, 1382, 2, 219, 1092, 22, 149, 22, 809, 7742, 1323, 263, 289, 2568, 35, 305, 193, 4, 3, 221, 284, 1, 537, 57, 16, 1336, 6, 401, 1512, 12, 284, 954, 4, 270, 636, 2, 4, 748, 183, 1510, 5, 954, 4, 3, 397, 119, 1, 3, 100, 32, 1336, 6, 2378, 270, 2590, 80, 2926, 4, 12, 455]",2458.0,14603539,238

Expression of EphB4 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"Ear, nose, & throat journal",Ear Nose Throat J,2003-11-01,"EphB4 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is expressed on epithelial cells during fetal life. It is also expressed on some venous endothelial cells. We conducted a study of six men with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) that had metastasized to the cervical lymph nodes. Our goal was to determine if EphB4 is aberrantly expressed in cases of HNSCC and to determine if there is a qualitative difference between the expression of EphB4 on primary and metastatic tumors and its expression on normal mucosa adjacent to primary tumors. From each patient, we obtained specimens of the primary tumor, the nodal metastasis, and the adjacent normal mucosa, and we performed immunocytochemistry on each.

Medullary thyroid carcinoma: results of a standardized surgical approach in a contemporary series of 80 consecutive patients.,Surgery,Surgery,2003-12-01,"The surgical management and follow-up strategy in patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) remain controversial because of the lack of data on the natural history of these tumors and their patterns of progression. We reviewed the records of all patients who underwent a cervical operation for MTC between 1991 and 2002. Compartment-oriented surgery (COS) was performed to minimize the risk of cervical recurrence. We identified 92 consecutive patients who underwent a cervical operation for MTC: 80 had invasive MTC, and 12 had C-cell hyperplasia after prophylactic thyroidectomy for familial MTC. Ten (13%) of the 80 patients with invasive MTC presented with distant metastases and underwent COS to achieve local-regional control; cervical recurrence developed in none, but three have died of MTC. The remaining 70 patients underwent COS for primary (n=23) or recurrent (n=47) MTC. Disease recurred in 18 (26%) of these 70 patients at a median follow-up of 35 months, with 10 (14%) of the recurrences being cervical. Recurrent disease was associated with a basal calcitonin level of >250 pg/mL in all but four patients, two of whom showed tumor dedifferentiation. In contrast, only 5 (11%) patients without evidence of recurrence had basal calcitonin levels of >250 pg/mL at last follow-up. Complete COS minimizes cervical recurrence.

Role of preoperative ultrasonography in the surgical management of patients with thyroid cancer.,Surgery,Surgery,2003-12-01,"Cervical recurrence occurs in up to 30% of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma. We retrospectively compared preoperative transcutaneous ultrasonography and physical examination (PE) results in the detection of local-regional metastases (lymph node and soft tissue) in patients with thyroid cancer. Data were collected retrospectively from the medical records of patients with thyroid carcinoma who underwent preoperative ultrasonography. Patients were divided into 3 groups: group 1, those undergoing primary thyroid/neck surgery; group 2, those undergoing reoperation for persistent disease; and group 3, those undergoing reoperation for recurrent thyroid carcinoma. For each group, we recorded the frequencies with which ultrasonography detected disease in a neck compartment (central or lateral) that was normal on PE. Two hundred twelve patients underwent operation for primary, persistent, or recurrent papillary (n=130), medullary (n=61), or follicular/Hürthle cell (n=21) carcinoma. Ultrasonography detected additional sites of metastatic disease not appreciated on PE in 21 (20%) of 107 group 1 patients, 9 (32%) of 28 group 2 patients, and 52 (68%) of 77 group 3 patients. The surgical procedure performed was altered by the information obtained from preoperative ultrasonography in 82 (39%) of the 212 patients. Of the 107 group 1 patients, cervical recurrence has been detected in only 6 (6%) at a median follow-up of 36 months, in spite of 67 (63%) having tumors larger than 2 cm or lymph node metastases. Preoperative high-quality ultrasonography detected lymph node or soft-tissue metastases in neck compartments believed to be uninvolved by PE in 39% of patients.

Impact of intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring on the prediction of multiglandular parathyroid disease.,World journal of surgery,World J Surg,2004-01-08,"Optimal interpretation of the results of intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring during neck exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is still controversial. The reliability of the ""50% rule"" in multiglandular disease (MGD) is often disputed, mostly because of competing pathophysiologic paradigms. The aim of this study was to ascertain and corroborate the ability of IOPTH monitoring to detect MGD in a practice, combining conventional and alternative parathyroidectomy techniques. This is a retrospective single institution analysis of 69 consecutive patients undergoing cervical exploration for pHPT by various approaches. The IOPTH measurements were performed after induction of anesthesia but prior to skin incision and 10 minutes after excision of the first visualized enlarged parathyroid gland. In this series, 55 patients (80%) had single adenomas, and 14 patients (20%) had MGD. In 8 of the 14 patients with MGD, IOPTH levels were obtained sequentially after removal of every enlarged gland. Of these 8 patients, 6 (75%) had a false-positive decrease (decrease below 50% of baseline value in presence of another enlarged gland) failing to predict the presence of a second enlarged gland. In 2 cases IOPTH monitoring provided a true-negative result, correctly predicting MGD. If MGD is defined by gross morphologic criteria, IOPTH monitoring fails to predict the presence of MGD reliably. However, if MGD is defined by functional criteria, the course of these patients does not seem significantly affected. The importance of these findings must be further investigated, especially with regard to the outcome of minimally invasive parathyroid procedures.",Journal Article,5857.0,68.0,Optimal interpretation of the results of intraoperative hormone IOPTH monitoring during exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism pHPT is still controversial The reliability of the `` 50 rule '' in multiglandular disease MGD is often disputed mostly because of competing pathophysiologic paradigms The aim of this study was to ascertain and corroborate the ability of IOPTH monitoring to detect MGD in a practice combining conventional and alternative parathyroidectomy techniques This is a retrospective single institution analysis of 69 consecutive patients undergoing exploration for pHPT by various approaches The IOPTH measurements were performed after induction of anesthesia but prior to incision and 10 minutes after excision of the first visualized enlarged gland In this series 55 patients 80 had single adenomas and 14 patients 20 had MGD In 8 of the 14 patients with MGD IOPTH levels were obtained sequentially after removal of every enlarged gland Of these 8 patients 6 75 had a false-positive decrease decrease below 50 of baseline value in presence of another enlarged gland failing to predict the presence of a second enlarged gland In 2 cases IOPTH monitoring provided a true-negative result correctly predicting MGD If MGD is defined by gross morphologic criteria IOPTH monitoring fails to predict the presence of MGD reliably However if MGD is defined by functional criteria the course of these patients does not seem significantly affected The importance of these findings must be further investigated especially with regard to the outcome of minimally invasive procedures,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[665, 3037, 1, 3, 99, 1, 1720, 785, 28171, 1315, 190, 3370, 9, 86, 9630, 19512, 16, 1234, 2010, 3, 4217, 1, 3, 212, 5340, 522, 4, 33318, 34, 11809, 16, 629, 23085, 2754, 408, 1, 2573, 11575, 4887, 3, 1130, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 6040, 2, 14855, 3, 801, 1, 28171, 1315, 6, 1426, 11809, 4, 8, 758, 1525, 809, 2, 1091, 23116, 1092, 26, 16, 8, 459, 226, 731, 65, 1, 790, 935, 7, 479, 3370, 9, 19512, 20, 747, 611, 3, 28171, 1685, 11, 173, 50, 504, 1, 6433, 84, 324, 6, 7538, 2, 79, 2511, 50, 1366, 1, 3, 157, 6326, 7547, 2326, 4, 26, 988, 614, 7, 493, 42, 226, 2751, 2, 213, 7, 179, 42, 11809, 4, 66, 1, 3, 213, 7, 5, 11809, 28171, 148, 11, 683, 5455, 50, 2829, 1, 454, 7547, 2326, 1, 46, 66, 7, 49, 481, 42, 8, 2133, 109, 775, 775, 2736, 212, 1, 330, 549, 4, 463, 1, 1809, 7547, 2326, 7928, 6, 678, 3, 463, 1, 8, 419, 7547, 2326, 4, 18, 140, 28171, 1315, 1052, 8, 2501, 199, 757, 4911, 1434, 11809, 492, 11809, 16, 395, 20, 1789, 2815, 371, 28171, 1315, 7688, 6, 678, 3, 463, 1, 11809, 4092, 137, 492, 11809, 16, 395, 20, 583, 371, 3, 906, 1, 46, 7, 1097, 44, 3233, 97, 1424, 3, 1187, 1, 46, 272, 1642, 40, 195, 565, 1093, 5, 2539, 6, 3, 228, 1, 2144, 416, 1369]",1594.0,14708048,204
Rapid involution and mobility of carcinoma of the cervix.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2004-02-01,"To quantitatively describe the involution and mobility of carcinoma of the cervix while under treatment with chemoradiotherapy (both with external beam radiation [EBRT] and high-dose-rate [HDR] intracavitary therapy). These data have implications for conformal or intensity modulated radiation therapy boost to the cervix. Seventeen patients underwent HDR brachytherapy boost to the cervix and were evaluated by repeat clinical examinations. In most cases, 5 weekly HDR brachytherapy insertions were performed after approximately 2 to 3 weeks of the initiation of EBRT. Sequential clinical tumor sizes were recorded in the chart for each patient under treatment. Linear regression analyses were performed to analyze tumor size as a function of total dose of external beam plus brachytherapy and number of elapsed days during the treatment course. In addition, the mobility of the cervix was documented by placement of a uterine sleeve for HDR brachytherapy before the initiation of therapy, and changes in sleeve position were identified on portal films relative to the midline of the pubic symphysis, in three dimensions. The anatomic position of the cervix was also identified at the time of simulation for HDR brachytherapy. Seventeen patients were identified and selected to receive HDR brachytherapy at our institution. Sixteen of the 17 patients received concurrent chemotherapy. The median dose at which tumor was no longer clinically evident was 61.5 Gy (95% confidence interval [CI]: 50.7-72.3 Gy) by linear regression analysis. This indicates that the median dose to achieve a 50% reduction in tumor size is approximately 30.8 Gy. Similarly, the median number of elapsed days for a complete response was 42 days (95% CI: 34-50 elapsed days). This indicates that it takes 21 days to achieve a 50% clinical complete response for patients undergoing concurrent cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy and HDR brachytherapy. In addition, the mobility of the cervix during EBRT was noted by serial measurements of the location of a metallic ring in the uterine sleeve, as seen on port films. The median and maximum ranges for change in the position of the cervix in the lateral (x), superior/inferior (y), and anterior/posterior (z) planes were 10, 8, and 16 mm and 24, 36, and 23 mm, respectively. Also, 85 brachytherapy procedures were performed, and the positions of the cervix on 170 orthogonal films were evaluated. The median and maximum ranges for the position of the cervix at the time of HDR brachytherapy in the lateral (x), superior/inferior (y), and anterior/posterior (z) planes were 5, 12, and 10 mm and 11, 25, and 32 mm, respectively. Carcinoma of the cervix involutes rapidly with EBRT, concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy, and HDR brachytherapy. The time for 50% tumor regression was calculated to be 21 days and occurs after 30.8 Gy. In addition, uterine sleeve placement allowed us to document the median and maximum ranges of cervical mobility during the treatment course of EBRT to be 8-16 mm and 23-36 mm, and at the time of HDR brachytherapy to be 5-12 mm and 11-32 mm, respectively. These data indicate that the cervix gross tumor volume changes rapidly in a systematic fashion during chemoradiotherapy and, together with the mobility of the cervix, urge caution in nonbrachytherapy

Radiotherapy for cutaneous malignant melanoma: rationale and indications.,"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)","Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",2004-01-01,"The use of radiation as adjuvant therapy for patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma has been hindered by the unsubstantiated belief that melanoma cells are radioresistant. An abundance of literature has now demonstrated that locoregional relapse of melanoma is common after surgery alone when certain clinicopathologic features are present. Features associated with a high risk of primary tumor recurrence include desmoplastic subtype, positive microscopic margins, recurrent disease, and thick primary lesions with ulceration or statellitosis. Features associated with a high risk of nodal relapse include extracapsular extension, involvement of four or more lymph nodes, lymph nodes measuring at least 3 cm, cervical lymph node location, and recurrent disease. Numerous studies support the efficacy of adjuvant irradiation in these clinical situations. Although data in the literature remain sparse, evidence also indicates that elective irradiation is effective in eradicating subclinical nodal metastases after removal of the primary melanoma. Consequently, there may be an opportunity to integrate radiotherapy into the multimodality treatment of patients at high risk of subclinical nodal disease, particularly those with an involved sentinel lymph node. Such patients are known to have a low rate of additional lymph node involvement, and thus in this group, a short course of radiotherapy may be an adequate substitute for regional lymph node dissection.

"Malignant mixed Müllerian tumors of the uterus: analysis of patterns of failure, prognostic factors, and treatment outcome.","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2004-03-01,"To determine the survival outcomes, prognostic factors, and patterns of failure in patients with malignant mixed Müllerian tumor (MMMT) of the uterus. Between 1954 and 1998, 300 patients with clinical Stage I-III MMMT of the uterus were treated with curative intent at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Their hospital records were reviewed to obtain patient and tumor characteristics; details of surgery, radiotherapy (RT), and chemotherapy; and long-term outcome. Surviving patients were followed for a median of 109 months (range 15-138). Survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with differences assessed by log-rank tests. Of the 300 patients, 113 (38%) were treated with surgery alone, 160 (53%) with surgery plus adjuvant EBRT or ICRT, and 27 (9%) with RT alone. Forty-eight patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. At 5 years, the overall rates of survival and cause-specific survival were 31% and 33%, respectively. Women who were postmenopausal or had a history of prior pelvic RT, pain at presentation, clinical Stage II-III disease, uterine enlargement (>/=12 weeks), or an abnormal Papanicolaou smear finding had a significantly poorer prognosis than the other patients in the series. Of the 273 patients who underwent surgery, those who had positive abdominal washings, uterine length >10 cm, or extrauterine spread of disease to the cervix, adnexa, or peritoneum had a significantly worse prognosis than the other patients. Factors found on multivariate analysis to have an independent adverse influence on cause-specific survival included postmenopausal status (p = 0.0007, relative risk [RR] 3.3), uterine length >10 cm (p = 0.0001, RR 2.2), cervical involvement (p = 0.002, RR 1.8), and peritoneal involvement (p = 0.0001, RR 4.3). At 5 years, the rates of pelvic and distant disease recurrence for the entire group of 300 patients were 38% and 57%, respectively. The most common site of distant recurrence was the peritoneal cavity. Patients treated with pelvic RT had a lower rate of pelvic recurrence than patients treated with surgery alone (28% vs. 48%, p = 0.0002), but the overall survival rates (36% vs. 27%, p = 0.10) and distant metastasis rates (57% vs. 54%, p = 0.96) were not significantly different. However, patients treated with pelvic RT had a longer mean time to any distant relapse (17.3 vs. 7.0 months, p = 0.001) than patients treated with surgery alone. The use of adjuvant chemotherapy did not correlate with the survival rate or rate of distant metastasis. Adjuvant pelvic RT decreased the risk of pelvic recurrence and may delay the appearance of distant metastases after hysterectomy for MMMT. However, the survival rates remain poor because of a high rate of distant recurrence. As more effective systemic chemotherapy is developed to control microscopic distant disease, the role of RT in controlling locoregional disease in the pelvis and abdomen may become more important.

Vinorelbine was administered on the same day as cisplatin at a starting dose of 10 mg/m(-2)/week and escalated in 5 mg/m(-2)/week increments. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as: grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity, grade 4 hematologic toxicity, or any toxicity which required > or =1 week delay in RT or an omission of >1 dose of chemotherapy. Between April 2001 and September 2002, 12 women with pelvic malignancies (11 cervical, 1 recurrent ovarian) were enrolled. Cohorts of 3, 6, and 3 patients were treated at 10, 15, and 20 mg/m(-2)/week dose levels of vinorelbine. At the 20 mg/m2 level, DLT was observed.

Adenocarcinoma of the cervix.,Current treatment options in oncology,Curr Treat Options Oncol,2004-04-01,"Cervical adenocarcinomas are increasing in incidence each year, comprising up to 25% of all cervical cancers diagnosed in the United States. This increase largely reflects the inherent difficulty in detecting glandular precursor lesions using current screening practices. However, there also appears to be a recent shift in the epidemiology of the disease process with younger women being diagnosed more frequently. Fertility-sparing surgery is an option for selected patients with adenocarcinoma in situ or stage IA(1) cervical adenocarcinoma. Simple hysterectomy should be performed at the completion of childbearing or when preserving fertility is not an issue. The treatment of choice for most women with stage IA(2) to IB(1) disease is radical hysterectomy. Fewer than 20% of patients will need adjuvant therapy and the cure rate is excellent. Primary radiation with weekly cisplatin may be the best option for patients with stage IB(2) to IIA cervical adenocarcinoma. Patients treated initially by primary radical surgery will almost certainly require postoperative chemoradiation because of high-risk surgical-pathologic features.

Pelvic irradiation with concurrent chemotherapy versus pelvic and para-aortic irradiation for high-risk cervical cancer: an update of radiation therapy oncology group trial (RTOG) 90-01.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2004-03-01,"To report mature results of a randomized trial that compared extended-field radiotherapy (EFRT) versus pelvic radiotherapy with concomitant fluorouracil and cisplatin (CTRT) in women with locoregionally advanced carcinomas of the uterine cervix. Four hundred three women with cervical cancer were randomly assigned to receive either EFRT or CTRT. Patients were eligible if they had stage IIB to IVA disease, stage IB to IIA disease with a tumor diameter > or = 5 cm, or positive pelvic lymph nodes. Patients were stratified by stage and by method of lymph node evaluation. The median follow-up time for 228 surviving patients was 6.6 years. The overall survival rate for patients treated with CTRT was significantly greater than that for patients treated with EFRT (67% v 41% at 8 years; P <.0001). There was an overall reduction in the risk of disease recurrence of 51% (95% CI, 36% to 66%) for patients who received CTRT.

The diagnostic utility of human papillomavirus-testing in combination with immunohistochemistry in advanced gynaecologic pelvic tumours: a new diagnostic approach.,International journal of oncology,Int. J. Oncol.,2004-04-01,"Gynaecologic pelvic tumours comprise a range of histological entities that are highly variable with respect to their clinical behaviour. The distinction of these tumours can be extremely difficult. Accurate identification of the primary tumour site has significant impact on the treatment strategy and prognosis. In this study we investigated the diagnostic and clinical utility of HPV (Human Papillomavirus)-testing in combination with selected immunohistochemical markers in advanced pelvic tumours of unknown primary origin. Specimens of eight patients who presented with advanced gynaecologic pelvic tumour of unknown primary origin, 10 unequivocal cervical carcinomas with 10 corresponding metastases and 10 unequivocal endometrial carcinomas with 4 corresponding metastases were studied. All cases were analysed for HPV-infection by PCR. The expression of CEA, vimentin (VIM), estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) was studied by immunohistochemistry. HPV-DNA was exclusively detected in cervical carcinomas and their corresponding metastases but in none of the endometrial carcinomas (Fisher's exact test p<0.001). Endometrial carcinomas and their metastases were generally positive for ER (86%), PR (93%) and VIM (100%) but rarely positive for CEA (14%) and HPV (0%). Most cervical carcinomas and their corresponding metastases were positive for CEA (79%) and HPV (89%). They rarely expressed ER (5%), PR (5%) and VIM (10%). Among the eight patients with unknown primary tumour four patients were diagnosed with a cervical carcinoma and four with an endometrial carcinoma. In one case we could exclude an ovarian carcinoma. Immunohistochemical analysis of selected markers in combination with HPV-testing is simple and inexpensive. The detection of HPV-DNA seems to provide the most compelling evidence for the primary tumour site, when immunohistochemical analysis is less definitive. The proposed diagnostic approach is helpful in the identification and management of pelvic tumours of unknown primary origin.",Journal Article,5773.0,16.0,Gynaecologic pelvic tumours comprise a range of histological entities that are highly variable with respect to their clinical behaviour The distinction of these tumours can be extremely difficult Accurate identification of the primary tumour site has significant impact on the treatment strategy and prognosis In this study we investigated the diagnostic and clinical utility of HPV Human Papillomavirus -testing in combination with selected immunohistochemical markers in advanced pelvic tumours of unknown primary origin Specimens of eight patients who presented with advanced gynaecologic pelvic tumour of unknown primary origin 10 unequivocal carcinomas with 10 corresponding metastases and 10 unequivocal carcinomas with 4 corresponding metastases were studied All cases were analysed for HPV-infection by PCR The expression of CEA vimentin VIM estrogen receptor ER and progesterone receptor PR was studied by immunohistochemistry HPV-DNA was exclusively detected in carcinomas and their corresponding metastases but in none of the carcinomas Fisher 's exact test p 0.001 carcinomas and their metastases were generally positive for ER 86 PR 93 and VIM 100 but rarely positive for CEA 14 and HPV 0 Most carcinomas and their corresponding metastases were positive for CEA 79 and HPV 89 They rarely expressed ER 5 PR 5 and VIM 10 Among the eight patients with unknown primary tumour four patients were diagnosed with a carcinoma and four with an carcinoma In one case we could exclude an carcinoma Immunohistochemical analysis of selected markers in combination with HPV-testing is simple and inexpensive The detection of HPV-DNA seems to provide the most compelling evidence for the primary tumour site when immunohistochemical analysis is less definitive The proposed diagnostic approach is helpful in the identification and management of pelvic tumours of unknown primary origin,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[23316, 1110, 1319, 5238, 8, 184, 1, 1831, 4613, 17, 32, 561, 1347, 5, 2184, 6, 136, 38, 8173, 3, 6628, 1, 46, 1319, 122, 40, 2938, 1740, 1481, 911, 1, 3, 86, 770, 606, 71, 93, 345, 23, 3, 24, 692, 2, 356, 4, 26, 45, 21, 565, 3, 752, 2, 38, 1207, 1, 933, 171, 3242, 471, 4, 150, 5, 715, 1382, 525, 4, 131, 1110, 1319, 1, 860, 86, 1938, 623, 1, 659, 7, 54, 917, 5, 131, 23316, 1110, 770, 1, 860, 86, 1938, 79, 14775, 826, 5, 79, 1734, 196, 2, 79, 14775, 826, 5, 39, 1734, 196, 11, 656, 62, 140, 11, 3141, 9, 933, 930, 20, 604, 3, 55, 1, 3088, 4840, 18341, 808, 153, 516, 2, 2143, 153, 998, 10, 656, 20, 888, 933, 261, 10, 4437, 530, 4, 826, 2, 136, 1734, 196, 84, 4, 1292, 1, 3, 826, 3135, 292, 2472, 412, 19, 13, 144, 826, 2, 136, 196, 11, 1228, 109, 9, 516, 868, 998, 966, 2, 18341, 394, 84, 2416, 109, 9, 3088, 213, 2, 933, 13, 96, 826, 2, 136, 1734, 196, 11, 109, 9, 3088, 842, 2, 933, 887, 491, 2416, 570, 516, 33, 998, 33, 2, 18341, 79, 107, 3, 659, 7, 5, 860, 86, 770, 294, 7, 11, 265, 5, 8, 134, 2, 294, 5, 35, 134, 4, 104, 473, 21, 359, 6262, 35, 134, 1382, 65, 1, 715, 525, 4, 150, 5, 933, 471, 16, 2763, 2, 8168, 3, 638, 1, 933, 261, 2744, 6, 377, 3, 96, 6051, 241, 9, 3, 86, 770, 606, 198, 1382, 65, 16, 299, 1057, 3, 1587, 752, 353, 16, 3951, 4, 3, 911, 2, 284, 1, 1110, 1319, 1, 860, 86, 1938]",1883.0,15010819,6

Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix: outcome and patterns of recurrence.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2004-04-01,"To analyze the sites of relapse and overall survival in women with neuroendocrine marker-positive small cell carcinoma of the cervix. The records of all women who had their initial treatment for cervical cancer at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1980 and 2000 were reviewed. Fifty-one patients had stages I-III cancers that were originally described as ""small cell"" or ""neuroendocrine."" Histological material was available for reexamination in 45 cases; of these, 21 were found to have small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNEC) as indicated by positive staining for chromogranin, synaptophysin, or CD56. Local treatment consisted of a radical hysterectomy in six patients and radiation therapy in 15. Thirteen patients received chemotherapy as part of their initial treatment. The median follow-up for surviving patients was 83 months (range, 25-209 months). Fourteen (66%) of the 21 patients had a relapse. The median time to first relapse from the initiation of treatment was 8.4 months (range, 3.6-28 months). Most patients developed hematogenous distant metastases before their death. Only 2 of 15 patients who were treated with radiation therapy had a recurrence within the radiation fields. However, five patients had a recurrence above the radiation fields in the paraaortic lymph nodes, and two patients had a recurrence distal to the pelvic fields in the vagina. No patient had brain metastases as the sole site of first recurrence. However, two patients developed brain metastases concurrently with lung metastases. The overall survival rate was 29% at 5 years; none of the patients who had disease more extensive than stage IB1 or clinical evidence of lymph node metastases survived their disease.

Squamous cell carcinoma related oncogene regulates angiogenesis through vascular endothelial growth factor-A.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2004-05-01,"Squamous cell carcinoma related oncogene expression (SCCRO) correlates with vascular endothelial growth factor-A expression. This data is validated in human lung tumors and provides a putative pathway for angiogenesis in a subset of squamous cell carcinomas. Squamous cell carcinoma related oncogene is a novel oncogene identified by positional cloning of a recurrent amplification at 3q26.3. It is over-expressed in 39.8% of lung, head and neck, cervical, and ovarian carcinomas. SCCRO imparts an aggressive phenotype to affected cancers, which may be related to increased angiogenesis due to SCCRO expression. Our previous work has demonstrated a link between SCCRO and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) expression in vitro, suggesting a mechanism for SCCRO-induced angiogenesis. The present study aims to confirm and validate this link between SCCRO and VEGF-A expression in an ex vivo human tumor cohort. Fresh tissue was collected at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from 34 patients undergoing primary resection of lung squamous cell carcinomas. RNA was extracted from this tissue, reverse-transcribed, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried out using a BioRad iQ iCycler with SYBR green fluorophore. Microvessel counting was performed on the tumor specimens using CD34 immunohistochemistry. The expression of both SCCRO and VEGF-A mRNA varies widely in both tumor and normal tissue. SCCRO and VEGF-A co-expression was significantly correlated (R(2) = 0.63; P < 0.032). Microvessel counts were not associated with expression of SCCRO or VEGF-A and failed to significantly predict survival. VEGF-A expression in this patient group is a predictor of overall survival (P < 0.032). VEGF-A expression correlates with SCCRO expression in these primary human lung squamous cell carcinomas and is a predictor of clinical behavior.

Promoter hypermethylation of FANCF: disruption of Fanconi Anemia-BRCA pathway in cervical cancer.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2004-05-01,"Patients with advanced stage invasive cervical cancer (CC) exhibit highly complex genomic alterations and respond poorly to conventional treatment protocols. In our efforts to understand the molecular genetic basis of CC, we examined the role of Fanconi Anemia (FA)-BRCA pathway. Here, we show that FANCF gene is disrupted by either promoter hypermethylation and/or deregulated gene expression in a majority of CC. Inhibition of DNA methylation and histone deacetylases induces FANCF gene re-expression in CC cell lines. FANCF-deregulated CC cell lines also exhibit a chromosomal hypersensitivity phenotype after exposure to an alkylating agent, a characteristic of FA patients. We also show the involvement of BRCA1 gene by promoter hypermethylation or down-regulated expression in a small subset of CC patients. Thus, we have found inactivation of genes in the FA-BRCA pathway by epigenetic alterations in a high proportion of CC patients, suggesting a major role for this pathway in the development of cervical cancer. Thus, these results have important implications in understanding the molecular basis of CC tumorigenesis and clinical management in designing targeted experimental therapeutic protocols.",Journal Article,5743.0,152.0,Patients with advanced stage invasive cancer CC exhibit highly complex genomic alterations and respond poorly to conventional treatment protocols In our efforts to understand the molecular genetic basis of CC we examined the role of Fanconi Anemia FA -BRCA pathway Here we show that FANCF gene is disrupted by either promoter hypermethylation and/or deregulated gene expression in a majority of CC Inhibition of DNA methylation and histone deacetylases induces FANCF gene re-expression in CC cell lines FANCF-deregulated CC cell lines also exhibit a chromosomal hypersensitivity phenotype after exposure to an alkylating agent a characteristic of FA patients We also show the involvement of BRCA1 gene by promoter hypermethylation or down-regulated expression in a small subset of CC patients Thus we have found inactivation of genes in the FA-BRCA pathway by epigenetic alterations in a high proportion of CC patients suggesting a major role for this pathway in the development of cancer Thus these results have important implications in understanding the molecular basis of CC tumorigenesis and clinical management in designing targeted experimental therapeutic protocols,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[7, 5, 131, 82, 416, 12, 1951, 2239, 561, 840, 572, 593, 2, 1892, 1240, 6, 809, 24, 2189, 4, 114, 1413, 6, 1640, 3, 219, 336, 877, 1, 1951, 21, 409, 3, 200, 1, 8057, 1545, 4307, 1555, 308, 467, 21, 514, 17, 15910, 145, 16, 5576, 20, 361, 973, 2575, 2, 15, 5415, 145, 55, 4, 8, 686, 1, 1951, 297, 1, 261, 569, 2, 1508, 9758, 1516, 15910, 145, 1491, 55, 4, 1951, 31, 285, 15910, 5415, 1951, 31, 285, 120, 2239, 8, 1860, 4034, 1005, 50, 645, 6, 35, 3410, 420, 8, 2037, 1, 4307, 7, 21, 120, 514, 3, 799, 1, 766, 145, 20, 973, 2575, 15, 1328, 1065, 55, 4, 8, 302, 697, 1, 1951, 7, 631, 21, 47, 204, 2297, 1, 214, 4, 3, 4307, 1555, 308, 20, 1418, 593, 4, 8, 64, 920, 1, 1951, 7, 802, 8, 458, 200, 9, 26, 308, 4, 3, 193, 1, 12, 631, 46, 99, 47, 305, 1268, 4, 612, 3, 219, 877, 1, 1951, 1565, 2, 38, 284, 4, 5048, 238, 1560, 189, 2189]",1173.0,15126331,113
Prognostic significance of erythropoietin expression in human endometrial carcinoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2004-06-01,"Erythropoietin (Epo), which is induced by hypoxia, controls erythropoiesis and protects neurons from hypoxic damage. Hypoxia in malignant disease is associated with invasion, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. The authors recently demonstrated hypoxia-stimulated expression of Epo and Epo receptor (EpoR) in human breast and cervical carcinomas, suggesting a role for autocrine Epo signaling in the hypoxic adaptations of carcinomas. The authors characterized the expression of Epo, EpoR, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PR) by immunohistochemical methods using endometrial carcinoma samples from 107 women and benign endometrial samples from 59 women in various phases of the menstrual cycle. They then analyzed potential correlations of Epo and EpoR immunostaining and clinicopathologic tumor features with outcome. In benign endometrial tissue samples, Epo and EpoR expression increased over the course of the cycle, with the highest levels observed in the late secretory phase. Epo expression in benign endometrial samples showed a negative correlation with ER and PR expression. The authors found Epo and EpoR expression in 95.3 % and 100% of endometrial carcinoma samples, respectively. Increased EpoR, but not Epo, expression in tumors was associated with advanced-stage disease, lymphovascular invasion, lymph node metastasis, and loss of ER expression. Increased Epo expression was observed in perinecrotic tumor regions in a pattern similar to the HIF-1alpha expression pattern. Increased Epo expression was significantly associated with adverse clinical outcome on both univariate and multivariate analysis. Hypoxia-inducible autocrine Epo signaling in endometrial carcinoma may contribute to tumor progression and increased aggressiveness.

We investigated the cellular and molecular effects of 30 micromol/L Coenzyme Q10 in HeLa cells. Cell growth assays, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses, and Oil Red O staining were performed.

Intraobserver variability in the MR determination of tumor volume in squamous cell carcinoma of the pharynx.,AJNR. American journal of neuroradiology,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,,"If tumor volumes are to be used for evaluating responses to treatment and long-term outcomes of patients with primary pharyngeal carcinomas, the reproducibility of these measurements must be established. We determined the intraobserver variability of MR imaging-based volume measurements of these cancers and their regional metastases. We used an interactive computer program (IDL) that enables the extraction of tumor volumes from 3D MR data to obtain 202 volume measurements in 17 patients with pharyngeal carcinoma (two to five time points each). The primary cancer and largest nodal mass were manually outlined on every T2-weighted image of each MR study. The same neuroradiologist reanalyzed this MR dataset 2-41 weeks later. Measurement error and percentage measurement error (intraobserver variability) were determined. Differences in intraobserver variability between primary lesions and nodes, as well as between stages of treatment were tested with a Wilcoxon rank sum test. The mean and median percentage measurement errors, respectively, were 13% and 12% (range, 0-53%; 95% CI: 10%, 16%) for primary tumors and 9% and 7% (range, 0-37%; 95% CI: 7%, 12%) for nodal metastases. The difference in the percentage measurement error between primary lesions and cervical nodes approached statistical significance (P =.07). Differences in the variation of volume measurements based on the stage of therapy were significant (P =.01). Our results suggest that MR imaging-based tumor volumes are reliably reproducible.

Radical hysterectomy followed by tailored postoperative therapy in the treatment of stage IB2 cervical cancer: feasibility and indications for adjuvant therapy.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2004-07-01,"To determine the outcome, complications and likelihood of requiring adjuvant therapy of patients with stage IB2 cervical cancer treated with primary radical hysterectomy and lymph node dissection. Clinical and pathologic data between 1985 and 1999 were reviewed. Associations between clinical and pathologic variables were tested using the Fisher's exact test. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with significance being calculated using the Log Rank test. Six hundred radical hysterectomies were performed during the study period. Fifty-eight of these women (9.6% of all radical hysterectomies) were diagnosed with FIGO stage IB2 cancers. Sixteen patients (28%) had positive pelvic lymph nodes. Forty-six patients (79%) had invasion involving the outer 1/3 of the cervical stroma, six had positive vaginal margins while five had occult parametrial extension. After retrospective review of the histopathologic data from this case series, criteria from two recently published prospective multicenter Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) trials were applied to this data set. According to criteria established by GOG protocol 92, 30 (52%) patients should have theoretically received adjuvant pelvic radiation while 21 (36%) would have qualified for adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation according to the results of GOG protocol 109. In actual fact, only 35 patients (60%) received adjuvant radiotherapy and one received adjuvant chemo-radiation. Severe toxicity was unusual with two developing urinary fistulae and one having a pulmonary embolism. Despite the lack of adjuvant therapy in most cases, only 21 women (38%) recurred of whom 11 failed on the pelvic wall, with an estimated 5-year survival of 62.1%. Radical hysterectomy and tailored adjuvant radiation therapy in stage IB2 cervical cancer is feasible. Even without the liberal use of adjuvant therapy, survival in this high-risk group compares favorably to primary chemotherapy and radiation. According to recently published randomized clinical trials, most patients should receive adjuvant postoperative therapy.

Surgical-pathological predictors of disease-free survival and risk groupings for IB2 cervical cancer: do the traditional models still apply?,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2004-08-01,"To evaluate how the independent predictors of recurrence for stage IB2 cervical cancers treated with up-front radical hysterectomy apply to established risk models. Patients with IB2 cervical cancers diagnosed from 1990 to 2000 were identified from tumor registries of two institutions. Patients were classified into risk groups: high-risk (HR) (positive nodes, parametria, or margins), intermediate-risk (IR) (positive lymph vascular space involvement (LVSI) with any cervical stromal invasion (CSI), or (-) LVSI and > middle- CSI), or low-risk (LR) (absence of HR or IR characteristics). Disease-free survival (DFS) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and comparisons between subgroups were studied by log rank. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine independent predictors of recurrence. We identified 86 patients with stage IB2 tumors treated by RH. We found 34% of patients to be HR, 60% IR, and 6% LR. Of the 52 IR patients, 28 had (+) LVSI with superficial, middle, and outer 1/3 CSI, and 24 had (-) LVSI with middle or outer 1/3 invasion. Overall, postoperative adjuvant radiation (PRT) was used in 52% of the 86 patients, including 0/5 LR, 16/52 IR, and 29/29 HR patients. Univariate predictors of recurrence were pelvic nodal disease, (+) LVSI, (+) parametria, outer 1/3 CSI, and tumor size > 6 cm. Age, grade, histology, and the use of postoperative radiation were not associated with recurrence. Multivariate analysis identified LVSI as the only independent predictor of recurrence (RR 5.2, P = 0.03). Two-year DFS for LR, IR, and HR patients was 100%, 83%, and 60%, respectively. Only 4/24 (17%) IR patients with (-) LVSI got PRT compared with 12/28 (43%) of IR patients with (+) LVSI. The 2-year DFS for IR patients with (-) LVSI was 96%.

Squamous carcinoma and carcinoma in situ from the female genital tract were examined for the expression of p16 by paraffin immunohistochemistry. About 74% (40/54) of cases showed p16 expression. By primary site, 77% (23/30) of cervical, 67% (6/9) of vaginal and 85% (11/13) of vulvar primaries expressed p16, but two endometrial primary squamous carcinomas were negative (0/2). In addition, p16 was not identified in non-dysplastic tissue and low grade dysplasia. In cases where there were matched vaginal or vulvar and cervical primaries in a given patient, there was concordant positive p16 expression. It is concluded that p16 is frequently expressed in squamous carcinoma of the cervix, vagina and vulva, but not seen in cases of benign and low grade lesions.

BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 gene mutational analysis was done on DNA isolated from liquid-based cervical or vaginal cytology taken from 17 consenting women (age 29-65 years) who previously had genetic counseling followed by BRACAnalysis (Myriad Genetics, Salt Lake City, UT) blood analyses. Eleven women had known mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 (cases) and six had no identified mutations (controls) on entry into the study. Anonymized cytology samples were sent to Myriad Genetics with a request for testing that was limited to the degree of genomic testing previously done on the blood samples. One cervicovaginal specimen from a test-positive woman had inadequate cellular content that precluded gene sequencing and therefore was excluded from this analysis. For the 16 women with adequate cytologic specimens, there was 100% concordance for BRCA mutation test results between blood and genital tract cytology (kappa = 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.51-1.0).

Oncol.,2004-10-01,"To compare stages IB1 and IB2 cervical cancers treated with radical hysterectomy (RH) and to define predictors of nodal status and recurrence. Patients with stage IB cervical cancers undergoing RH between 1990 and 2000 were evaluated and clinicopathological variables were abstracted. The perioperative complication rate, estimated blood loss (EBL), and OR time were also tabulated. Variables were analyzed using X(2) and t tests. Disease-free survival (DFS) was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis was performed via stepwise logistic regression. Cox-proportional hazards were used to identify independent predictors of recurrence. RH was performed on 109 stage IB1 and 86 stage IB2 patients. Mean age, EBL, and perioperative complication rates were similar. Overall, 38 patients (14 IB1 vs. 24 IB2) had positive nodes (P = 0.01) including 9 patients with positive para-aortic nodes (2 IB1 and 7 IB2). Parametrial involvement (PI) and outer 2/3 depth of invasion (DOI) were significantly more common in the IB2 tumors as well. Patients with IB2 disease received adjuvant radiation more frequently than IB1 patients (52% vs. 37%, P = 0.04). Univariate predictors of nodal status included lymphovascular space involvement (LVSI) (P = 0.001), DOI (P = 0.011), PI (P = 0.001), and stage (P = 0.011). Multivariate analysis identified only LVSI (OR 6.4, CI 2.4-17, P = 0. 0002) and PI (OR 8, CI 3.1-20, P = 0. 0001) as independent predictors of positive nodes. With a median follow-up of 35 months, estimates of DFS revealed tumor size (P = 0.008), nodal status (P = 0.0004), LVSI (P = 0.002), PI (P = 0.004), and DOI (P = 0.0004) as significant univariate predictors. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, age, grade, histology, and adjuvant radiation were not associated with recurrence. The significant independent predictors of DFS were LVSI (ROR 5.7, CI 2-16, P = 0.0064) and outer 2/3 DOI (OR 5.8, CI 2-20, P = 0.0029). Neither tumor size nor nodal status was a significant predictor of DFS.

Positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose to predict pathologic response after induction chemotherapy and definitive chemoradiotherapy in head and neck cancer.,Head & neck,Head Neck,2004-10-01,"Conventional imaging is limited in identifying persistent disease after organ-preserving therapy for patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). We studied the accuracy of positron emission tomography (PET) with (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET) in restaging disease in patients with SCCHN after they had undergone induction chemotherapy (ICT) followed by chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Forty patients with advanced SCCHN were treated with ICT followed by CRT. FDG-PET imaging was performed to assess for residual cancer at the primary site and in nodal metastases. Two nuclear medicine physicians interpreted PET scans in random sequence. Test characteristics were calculated with pathologic analysis or clinical recurrence as the standard. After induction chemotherapy, PET imaging had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 65% for detecting persistent disease at the primary tumor site. After ICT and CRT were completed, the sensitivity and specificity of PET imaging were 67% and 53%, respectively, for detecting occult disease in cervical lymph nodes.

Low D2-40 immunoreactivity correlates with lymphatic invasion and nodal metastasis in early-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2005-01-01,"Lymphatic invasion and nodal metastasis are predictors of shorter disease-free and overall survival in carcinoma of the uterine cervix. The monoclonal antibody D2-40, which reacts with the oncofetal membrane antigen M2A, is a new selective marker for lymphatic endothelium, and has been shown to be useful in identifying the presence of lymphatic invasion in various malignant neoplasms, including cervical carcinoma. However, the reactivity of the tumor cells with D2-40 has not yet been evaluated. In this study, we examined the pattern of D2-40 immunoreactivity in a series of 138 invasive squamous cell carcinomas of the uterine cervix. We correlated the presence and extent of D2-40 immunoreactivity in the tumor cells with various clinicopathologic features, the presence of lymphatic invasion, lymph node metastasis and outcome. Diffuse or focal D2-40 immunoreactivity was present in 17 (12%) and 81 (59%) tumors, respectively, while 40 (29%) tumors showed no immunoreactivity. Lymphatic invasion and nodal metastasis were present in 56 and 29% of tumors, respectively. Tumor emboli within lymphatic spaces and metastatic tumor foci in lymph nodes showed no immunoreactivity in 86 and 80% of the cases, respectively. Lymphatic invasion and nodal metastasis were significantly more common in tumors showing low D2-40 immunoreactivity (P<0.0001 and 0.022, respectively). D2-40 immunoreactivity showed no correlation with any other clinicopathologic features examined, including tumor size, grade and FIGO stage. In univariate analysis low D2-40 immunoreactivity was significantly associated with shorter recurrence-free, but not with overall survival. Our studies suggest that D2-40 immunostaining may serve as a marker for increased risk of lymphatic invasion and tumor recurrence in cervical biopsy material. Further study of the biological function of the M2A antigen may shed some light on the interaction of tumor cells with lymphatics.",Journal Article,5498.0,89.0,Lymphatic invasion and nodal metastasis are predictors of shorter disease-free and overall survival in carcinoma of the cervix The monoclonal antibody D2-40 which reacts with the oncofetal membrane antigen M2A is a new selective marker for lymphatic endothelium and has been shown to be useful in identifying the presence of lymphatic invasion in various malignant neoplasms including carcinoma However the reactivity of the tumor cells with D2-40 has not yet been evaluated In this study we examined the pattern of D2-40 immunoreactivity in a series of 138 invasive squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix We correlated the presence and extent of D2-40 immunoreactivity in the tumor cells with various clinicopathologic features the presence of lymphatic invasion lymph node metastasis and outcome Diffuse or focal D2-40 immunoreactivity was present in 17 12 and 81 59 tumors respectively while 40 29 tumors showed no immunoreactivity Lymphatic invasion and nodal metastasis were present in 56 and 29 of tumors respectively Tumor emboli within lymphatic spaces and metastatic tumor foci in lymph nodes showed no immunoreactivity in 86 and 80 of the cases respectively Lymphatic invasion and nodal metastasis were significantly more common in tumors showing low D2-40 immunoreactivity P 0.0001 and 0.022 respectively D2-40 immunoreactivity showed no correlation with any other clinicopathologic features examined including tumor size grade and FIGO stage In univariate analysis low D2-40 immunoreactivity was significantly associated with shorter recurrence-free but not with overall survival Our studies suggest that D2-40 immunostaining may serve as a marker for increased risk of lymphatic invasion and tumor recurrence in biopsy material Further study of the biological function of the M2A antigen may shed some light on the interaction of tumor cells with lymphatics,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[2936, 578, 2, 779, 278, 32, 674, 1, 985, 34, 115, 2, 63, 25, 4, 134, 1, 3, 3629, 3, 848, 548, 4171, 327, 92, 23374, 5, 3, 28288, 1905, 448, 43734, 16, 8, 217, 1094, 952, 9, 2936, 5300, 2, 71, 85, 443, 6, 40, 999, 4, 1386, 3, 463, 1, 2936, 578, 4, 747, 393, 1179, 141, 134, 137, 3, 4601, 1, 3, 30, 37, 5, 4171, 327, 71, 44, 1145, 85, 194, 4, 26, 45, 21, 409, 3, 1177, 1, 4171, 327, 4900, 4, 8, 988, 1, 4478, 416, 691, 31, 826, 1, 3, 3629, 21, 438, 3, 463, 2, 1039, 1, 4171, 327, 4900, 4, 3, 30, 37, 5, 747, 1399, 404, 3, 463, 1, 2936, 578, 263, 289, 278, 2, 228, 1388, 15, 2137, 4171, 327, 4900, 10, 364, 4, 269, 133, 2, 865, 728, 57, 106, 369, 327, 462, 57, 224, 77, 4900, 2936, 578, 2, 779, 278, 11, 364, 4, 664, 2, 462, 1, 57, 106, 30, 13259, 262, 2936, 11757, 2, 113, 30, 3340, 4, 263, 502, 224, 77, 4900, 4, 868, 2, 493, 1, 3, 140, 106, 2936, 578, 2, 779, 278, 11, 97, 80, 186, 4, 57, 2069, 154, 4171, 327, 4900, 19, 13, 488, 2, 13, 4773, 106, 4171, 327, 4900, 224, 77, 816, 5, 500, 127, 1399, 404, 409, 141, 30, 444, 88, 2, 3837, 82, 4, 880, 65, 154, 4171, 327, 4900, 10, 97, 41, 5, 985, 146, 115, 84, 44, 5, 63, 25, 114, 94, 309, 17, 4171, 327, 5027, 68, 1833, 22, 8, 952, 9, 101, 43, 1, 2936, 578, 2, 30, 146, 4, 411, 3692, 195, 45, 1, 3, 1037, 343, 1, 3, 43734, 448, 68, 5816, 476, 1691, 23, 3, 915, 1, 30, 37, 5, 9335]",1870.0,15467716,0

Percutaneous CT-guided biopsy of osseous lesion of the spine in patients with known or suspected malignancy.,AJNR. American journal of neuroradiology,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,2004-10-01,"CT-guided spinal biopsy (CTGSB) is considered a safe and accurate procedure. Our goal was to determine the accuracy of a CTGSB of osseous spinal lesions in patients with known or suspected underlying malignancy in reference to major variables such as the radiographic appearance of the biopsied lesion and its location within the spinal column. We retrospectively reviewed results of 410 consecutive percutaneous CTGSB procedures of osseous spinal lesions. Biopsy was determined to be adequate if diagnostic tissue was obtained (n = 401) or unsatisfactory (n = 9) if only blood without cellular elements was present on final pathologic-cytologic examination. The level of spinal biopsy was cervical in nine patients (2%), thoracic in 123 (31%), lumbar in 164 (42%), and sacral in 96 (25%). The overall diagnostic accuracy of CTGSB was 89%, with a false-negative rate of 11%. Biopsy of lytic lesions yielded an accurate diagnosis in 93% (220 of 236). Despite technical challenges inherent to biopsy of sclerotic lesions, diagnostic accuracy was 76% (63 of 83), although more importantly, 24% (20 of 83) of the results in sclerotic lesions were falsely negative. CTGSB of osseous spinal lesions is an important tool in the workup of patients with known or suspected underlying neoplastic disease.

Patterns of radiotherapy practice for patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix: a patterns of care study.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2004-11-01,"To determine the influence of research findings and evolving technology on the practice of radiotherapy in patients with carcinoma of the cervix. Radiation oncology facilities were randomly selected from two strata: those that treated <500 and those that treated >/=500 new cancer patients annually. Patient records were randomly selected from lists of eligible patients treated between 1996 and 1999 at each institution. A total of 442 patient records were reviewed at 59 facilities (55 with eligible patients). National estimates were made using weights that reflected the relative contribution of each institution and of each patient within the sampled institutions. Most estimates were based on the 383 patients who had received their initial therapy at a surveyed facility (excluding the 59 patients who were referred for brachytherapy only after initial treatment at another facility). The estimates of brachytherapy practice were based on the 408 patients who had received their brachytherapy at a surveyed facility. The data were compared with those obtained from a similar 1992-1994 survey. Overall, 40.5%, 25.4%, and 33.9% of patients had Stage IA-IIA, IIB, or IIIA-IVA disease, respectively. CT was the most common method of nodal evaluation, with surgical evaluation performed in only 12% of patients. Of the 55 facilities with eligible patients, 32 had treated <==8 eligible patients during the 4-year study period. We estimated that 27.5% of patients were treated at facilities that treated <==2 patients with intact cervical cancer annually; 43% were treated at facilities that treated <500 new patients annually. Patients treated at small facilities were significantly more likely to have received a total dose to Point A of <80 Gy, to have had their treatment protracted to >70 days, and to have undergone adjuvant hysterectomy or chemotherapy. In large facilities, radiotherapy was less likely to be protracted to >70 days in the 1996-1999 survey than in the 1992-1994 survey (p < 0.0001); however, in small facilities, treatment was more likely to be protracted than in the earlier survey (p = 0.06), contributing to increasing disparities between the treatments given in large and small facilities. Overall, 92.4% of patients treated with nonpalliative intent were treated with brachytherapy. Of the patients who received brachytherapy, 16.4% had at least part of their brachytherapy delivered at a high dose rate; this was not significantly greater than the proportion treated with high-dose-rate brachytherapy in the 1992-1994 survey (9.1%; p = 0.3). The proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy as part of their initial treatment in 1996-1999 (34.6%) was not significantly different statistically from that in 1992-1994 (25.6%; p = 0.3). However, in 1999, 63% of patients had received chemotherapy compared with 19%, 28%, and 26% in 1996, 1997, and 1998, respectively. The details and confirmation of chemotherapy administration were rarely documented in the radiation oncology clinic notes and hospital records. The sharp increase in the use of chemotherapy in 1999 suggested rapid application of the results from randomized trials. However, considerable heterogeneity in practice patterns remains, particularly in the use of brachytherapy. The practice at small facilities appears to differ significantly from that at larger facilities in several respects, with a statistically significantly larger proportion of treatments at small facilities failing to meet current guidelines for optimal treatment.",Comparative Study,5559.0,106.0,To determine the influence of research findings and evolving technology on the practice of

Factors influencing the basal and recombinant human thyrotropin-stimulated serum thyroglobulin in patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2004-12-01,"The serum thyroglobulin (Tg) level is the most sensitive marker for detecting residual thyroid carcinoma. We hypothesized that the basal and TSH-stimulated Tg levels in patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma would reflect tumor volume, histological subtype, and location of metastatic lesions. A retrospective review of 417 thyroid cancer survivors undergoing evaluation for residual disease with the assistance of recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) was performed. In 169 patients with metastatic disease, we found that the basal Tg level directly correlated with the number of lesions, and that it was highest in patients with follicular and lowest in those with papillary thyroid carcinoma. The basal Tg level was highest in patients with bone metastases and lowest in those with cervical metastases. The fold increase in the serum Tg after rhTSH treatment was highest in papillary thyroid carcinoma and lowest in Hurthle cell carcinoma.

A methodology to determine margins by EPID measurements of patient setup variation and motion as applied to immobilization devices.,Medical physics,Med Phys,2004-11-01,"Assessment of clinic and site specific margins are essential for the effective use of three-dimensional and intensity modulated radiation therapy. An electronic portal imaging device (EPID) based methodology is introduced which allows individual and population based CTV-to-PTV margins to be determined and compared with traditional margins prescribed during treatment. This method was applied to a patient cohort receiving external beam head and neck radiotherapy under an IRB approved protocol. Although the full study involved the use of an EPID-based method to assess the impact of (1) simulation technique, (2) immobilization, and (3) surgical intervention on inter- and intrafraction variations of individual and population-based CTV-to-PTV margins, the focus of the paper is on the technique. As an illustration, the methodology is utilized to examine the influence of two immobilization devices, the UON thermoplastic mask and the Type-S head/ neck shoulder immobilization system on margins. Daily through port images were acquired for selected fields for each patient with an EPID. To analyze these images, simulation films or digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRR's) were imported into the EPID software. Up to five anatomical landmarks were identified and outlined by the clinician and up to three of these structures were matched for each reference image. Once the individual based errors were quantified, the patient results were grouped into populations by matched anatomical structures and immobilization device. The variation within the subgroup was quantified by calculating the systematic and random errors (sigma(sub) and sigma(sub)). Individual patient margins were approximated as 1.65 times the individual-based random error and ranged from 1.1 to 6.3 mm (A-P) and 1.1 to 12.3 mm (S-I) for fields matched on skull and cervical structures, and 1.7 to 10.2 mm (L-R) and 2.0 to 13.8 mm (S-I) for supraclavicular fields. Population-based margins ranging from 5.1 to 6.6 mm (A-P) and 3.7 to 5.7 mm (S-I) were calculated for the corresponding skull/cervical field and 9.3 to 10.0 mm (L-R) and 6.3 to 6.6 mm (S-I) for the supraclavicular fields, respectively. The reported CTV-to-PTV margins are comparable to a value 7-15 mm based on traditional Mayo margins, but in some cases exceed the default values established in RTOG Head and Neck studies. The data suggests that the population-based margins provide sufficient coverage for the majority of the patients. However, the population-derived margins are excessive for some patients and insufficient for others, suggesting that a re-evaluation of current treatment margins for individual patients is warranted. Finally, this methodology provides direct evidence of treatment variation and thus can demonstrate with confidence, the superiority of one technique over another.",Clinical

"Phase I clinical trial of weekly paclitaxel, weekly carboplatin, and concurrent radiotherapy for primary cervical cancer.",Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2005-01-01,"Standard primary treatment for locally advanced cervix cancer is radiation (RT) with concomitant platinum-based chemotherapy (CT). Incomplete local control and the appearance of distant disease herald poor survival and warrant evaluation of new primary strategies. Paclitaxel and carboplatin are active agents in recurrent cervical carcinoma, have potent, synergistic in vitro radiosensitization, and are cytotoxic in weekly schedules. This study was done to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of weekly paclitaxel/carboplatin chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced cervix cancer. Women with primary, previously untreated, squamous cell or adenocarcinoma of the cervix, FIGO stage IB(2) to IVA, negative para-aortic lymph nodes, adequate organ function and performance status were eligible. Pelvic RT (45 Gy over 5 weeks--180 cGy/day, four-field) was followed by two brachytherapy applications (Point A low dose rate (LDR): 90 Gy, high dose rate (HDR): 75 Gy). Concurrent weekly CT was paclitaxel 50 mg/m(2) and carboplatin, starting at AUC 1.5 and escalating in three-patient cohorts by AUC 0.5 (Max AUC 3.5). Dose escalation followed a 4-week observation period for toxicity. A grade III-IV toxicity prompted up to three additional patients per dose level. A second event defined DLT. CT was administered concurrently throughout brachytherapy. Fifteen patients were enrolled and treated over four dose levels until DLT was reached. Median age was 44 years (range, 23-70); stages: IB2: 1, IIB: 9, IIIA: 1, IIIB: 4. Median RT treatment time was 61 days (range, 55-79). Fourteen patients received brachytherapy (LDR: 8, HDR: 6), and one received external RT only due to cervical stenosis. The median number of weekly CT cycles was seven (range, 6-7). One CT dose was dropped in one patient for a grade II thrombocytopenia. One grade III ANC was observed at dose level II (AUC 2.0) but not seen in three additional patients. At dose level IV (AUC 3.0), two grade III-IV ANC toxicities were observed in two patients (DLT). Nine patients had grade II anemia. One patient had grade III anemia. Grade III/IV nonhematologic toxicity was rare (1/15 GI-nausea/vomiting, 1/15 pneumonia, 1/15 hypokalemia). The MTD of carboplatin is AUC 2.5 with paclitaxel 50 mg/m(2).

Esophagectomy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy improves locoregional control in clinical stage II or III esophageal cancer patients.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2004-12-01,"To evaluate the effect of surgical resection on the outcome of patients with clinical Stage II or III cancer of the esophagus treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. A retrospective review of 132 consecutive patients with clinical Stage II or III esophageal cancer treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy between January 1990 and December 1998 was performed. Of the 132 patients, 60 underwent esophagectomy 6-8 weeks after chemoradiotherapy. The median radiation dose was 50 Gy (range, 30-64.8 Gy) in the definitive chemoradiation group and 45 Gy (range, 30-50.4 Gy) in the chemoradiation plus esophagectomy group. Statistically significant differences were found between the two groups in median age, histologic subtype, tumor location, and number of patients with T4 disease. Patients who underwent definitive chemoradiotherapy were older (p = 0.0004) and more likely to have squamous cell carcinoma than adenocarcinoma (p <0.000), upper thoracic or cervical esophageal tumors (p <0.000), and T4 tumors (p = 0.024). Patients treated with chemoradiation plus esophagectomy had statistically significant superior 5-year loco-regional control (67.1% vs. 22.1%, p <0.000), disease-free survival (40.7% vs. 9.9%, p < 0.000), and 5-year overall survival (52.6% vs. 6.5%, p < 0.000) rates and median survival time (62 vs. 12 months) compared with patients treated with chemoradiotherapy only. However, no statistically significant difference was found in the rate of distant metastasis-free survival between the two groups (67.5% vs. 65.8%, p = 0.3). Surgical resection of the tumor was an independent predictor of improved locoregional control and overall survival in both univariate and multivariate analyses. To reduce the effect of the selection bias on the outcome, 34 patients in each group with matched pretreatment characteristics were compared. The results showed statistically significant better overall survival, disease-free survival, and locoregional control in favor of the chemoradiotherapy plus esophagectomy group. No statistically significant difference in distant metastasis-free survival was found in this subgroup analysis. Locoregional control was better in clinical Stage II or III esophageal cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiation plus esophagectomy. An improvement in survival occurred in the chemoradiation plus esophagectomy group, although this observation may have reflected selection bias. The results from this study suggest the need for a randomized trial to compare chemoradiation with or without esophagectomy in the treatment of cancer of the esophagus.",Journal Article,5529.0,38.0,To evaluate the effect of surgical resection on the outcome of patients with clinical Stage II or III cancer of the treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy A retrospective review of 132 consecutive patients with clinical Stage II or III cancer treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy between January 1990 and December 1998 was performed Of the 132 patients 60 underwent esophagectomy 6-8 weeks after chemoradiotherapy The median radiation dose was 50 Gy range 30-64.8 Gy in the definitive chemoradiation group and 45 Gy range 30-50.4 Gy in the chemoradiation plus esophagectomy group Statistically significant differences were found between the two groups in median age histologic subtype tumor location and number of patients with T4 disease Patients who underwent definitive chemoradiotherapy were older p 0.0004 and more likely to have squamous cell carcinoma than adenocarcinoma p 0.000 upper thoracic or tumors p 0.000 and T4 tumors p 0.024 Patients treated with chemoradiation plus esophagectomy had statistically significant superior 5-year loco-regional control 67.1 vs. 22.1 p 0.000 disease-free survival 40.7 vs. 9.9 p 0.000 and 5-year overall survival 52.6 vs. 6.5 p 0.000 rates and median survival time 62 vs. 12 months compared with patients treated with chemoradiotherapy only However no statistically significant difference was found in the rate of distant metastasis-free survival between the two groups 67.5 vs. 65.8 p 0.3 Surgical resection of the tumor was an independent predictor of improved locoregional control and overall survival in both univariate and multivariate analyses To reduce the effect of the selection bias on the outcome 34 patients in each group with matched pretreatment characteristics were compared The results showed statistically significant better overall survival disease-free survival and locoregional control in favor of the chemoradiotherapy plus esophagectomy group No statistically significant difference in distant metastasis-free survival was found in this subgroup analysis Locoregional control was better in clinical Stage II or III cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiation plus esophagectomy An improvement in survival occurred in the chemoradiation plus esophagectomy group although this observation may have reflected selection bias The results from this study suggest the need for a randomized trial to compare chemoradiation with or without esophagectomy in the treatment of cancer of the,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,"[6, 376, 3, 254, 1, 221, 170, 23, 3, 228, 1, 7, 5, 38, 82, 215, 15, 316, 12, 1, 3, 73, 5, 750, 1464, 8, 459, 206, 1, 4255, 935, 7, 5, 38, 82, 215, 15, 316, 12, 73, 5, 750, 1464, 59, 1024, 2289, 2, 1397, 1850, 10, 173, 1, 3, 4255, 7, 335, 208, 3617, 49, 66, 244, 50, 1464, 3, 52, 121, 61, 10, 212, 381, 184, 201, 660, 66, 381, 4, 3, 1057, 975, 87, 2, 512, 381, 184, 201, 212, 39, 381, 4, 3, 975, 349, 3617, 87, 712, 93, 362, 11, 204, 59, 3, 100, 271, 4, 52, 89, 884, 875, 30, 1147, 2, 207, 1, 7, 5, 2463, 34, 7, 54, 208, 1057, 1464, 11, 434, 19, 13, 5295, 2, 80, 322, 6, 47, 691, 31, 134, 76, 449, 19, 13, 984, 1726, 2098, 15, 57, 19, 13, 984, 2, 2463, 57, 19, 13, 4247, 7, 73, 5, 975, 349, 3617, 42, 712, 93, 1123, 33, 111, 7214, 951, 182, 598, 14, 105, 350, 14, 19, 13, 984, 34, 115, 25, 327, 67, 105, 83, 83, 19, 13, 984, 2, 33, 111, 63, 25, 653, 49, 105, 49, 33, 19, 13, 984, 151, 2, 52, 25, 98, 744, 105, 133, 53, 72, 5, 7, 73, 5, 1464, 158, 137, 77, 712, 93, 523, 10, 204, 4, 3, 116, 1, 626, 278, 115, 25, 59, 3, 100, 271, 598, 33, 105, 556, 66, 19, 13, 27, 221, 170, 1, 3, 30, 10, 35, 306, 980, 1, 231, 1325, 182, 2, 63, 25, 4, 110, 880, 2, 331, 318, 6, 969, 3, 254, 1, 3, 881, 2947, 23, 3, 228, 562, 7, 4, 296, 87, 5, 655, 1194, 374, 11, 72, 3, 99, 224, 712, 93, 380, 63, 25, 34, 115, 25, 2, 1325, 182, 4, 4283, 1, 3, 1464, 349, 3617, 87, 77, 712, 93, 523, 4, 626, 278, 115, 25, 10, 204, 4, 26, 1363, 65, 1325, 182, 10, 380, 4, 38, 82, 215, 15, 316, 12, 7, 73, 5, 750, 975, 349, 3617, 35, 767, 4, 25, 489, 4, 3, 975, 349, 3617, 87, 242, 26, 1664, 68, 47, 4686, 881, 2947, 3, 99, 29, 26, 45, 309, 3, 594, 9, 8, 384, 160, 6, 932, 975, 5, 15, 187, 3617, 4, 3, 24, 1, 12, 1, 3]",2465.0,15590179,648
Preventable reoperations for persistent and recurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma.,Surgery,Surgery,2004-12-01,"Cervical recurrence occurs in up to 25% of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) due either to the aggressive biology of PTC or to inadequate treatment. This retrospective study was designed to determine the frequency of inadequate surgical or medical therapy as a cause of persistent or recurrent PTC. We identified all patients who underwent reoperation for persistent (within 6 months of initial or pre-referral operation) or recurrent (greater than 6 months after initial or pre-referral operation) PTC from 1992 to 2003. Medical records including initial preoperative imaging, operative, and histopathology reports were reviewed. The initial surgical procedure was considered incomplete if all gross neoplasm was not removed or if ""node plucking"" was performed, and a subsequent recurrence occurred in the same cervical compartment. Seventy-two consecutive patients underwent reoperation for persistent (17) or recurrent (55) PTC. Of the 17 patients with persistent PTC, reoperation was judged to have been possibly preventable in 14 (82%) due to inadequate preoperative imaging or incomplete initial surgery. Of the 55 patients with recurrent PTC, reoperation was judged to have been possibly preventable due to incomplete initial surgery in 14 (25%). Based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, 33 (46%) of 72 patients with persistent or recurrent PTC received inadequate initial local treatment.

An educational program to increase cervical and breast cancer screening in Hispanic women: a Southwest Oncology Group study.,Cancer nursing,Cancer Nurs,,"We conducted a community-based pilot study to train Hispanic cancer survivors as promotoras (lay health educators) to encourage their social contacts to obtain breast and cervical cancer screening. Promotoras were recruited from a private oncologist's practice at a Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (MBCCOP). Five Hispanic women were trained to serve as promotoras by attending a 12-week course. They shared cancer screening information with family and social contacts and encouraged them to obtain Papanicolaou smears and/or mammograms. Study endpoints included the number of women recruited and trained to serve as promotoras, the number of contacts made per promotora, and the number of contacts who were screened; data were based on contact logs maintained for 1 year. Screening examinations were documented by a postcard returned by the contact or by review of community health clinic records.

Rethinking the use of radiation and chemotherapy after radical hysterectomy: a clinical-pathologic analysis of a Gynecologic Oncology Group/Southwest Oncology Group/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trial.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2005-03-01,"To retrospectively analyze data from a previously reported randomized trial of either pelvic radiation (RT) or RT + chemotherapy (CT) in patients undergoing radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy with positive pelvic lymph nodes, parametrial involvement, or surgical margins; to explore associations between RT + CT; and to investigate histopathologic and clinical factors which might be predictive of recurrence. Histopathologic sections from biopsies and hysterectomies and clinical data were reviewed from patients with stage IA2, IB, or IIA cervical cancer treated with RT or RT + CT (cisplatin 70 mg/m2 plus fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for four cycles). A univariate analysis was performed because the relatively small sample size limited the interpretation of a multivariate analysis. Of the 268 enrolled women, 243 (RT = 116; RT + CT = 127) were evaluable. The beneficial effect of adjuvant CT was not strongly associated with patient age, histological type, or tumor grade. The prognostic significance of histological type, tumor size, number of positive nodes, and parametrial extension in the RT group was less apparent when CT was added. The absolute improvement in 5-year survival for adjuvant CT in patients with tumors < or =2 cm was only 5% (77% versus 82%), while for those with tumors >2 cm it was 19% (58% versus 77%). Similarly, the absolute 5-year survival benefit was less evident among patients with one nodal metastasis (79% versus 83%) than when at least two nodes were positive (55% versus 75%). In this exploratory, hypothesis-generating analysis, adding CT to RT after radical hysterectomy, appears to provide a smaller absolute benefit when only one node is positive or when the tumor size is < 2 cm. Further study of the role of CT after radical hysterectomy in patients with a low risk of recurrence may be warranted.",Clinical Trial,5439.0,122.0,To retrospectively analyze data from a previously reported randomized trial of either pelvic radiation RT or RT chemotherapy CT in patients undergoing radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy with positive pelvic lymph nodes parametrial involvement or surgical margins to explore associations between RT CT and to investigate histopathologic and clinical factors which might be predictive of recurrence Histopathologic sections from biopsies and hysterectomies and clinical data were reviewed from patients with stage IA2 IB or IIA cancer treated with RT or RT CT cisplatin 70 mg/m2 plus fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for four cycles A univariate analysis was performed because the relatively small sample size limited the interpretation of a multivariate analysis Of the 268 enrolled women 243 RT 116 RT CT 127 were evaluable The beneficial effect of adjuvant CT was not strongly associated with patient age histological type or tumor grade The prognostic significance of histological type tumor size number of positive nodes and parametrial extension in the RT group was less apparent when CT was added The absolute improvement in 5-year survival for adjuvant CT in patients with tumors or =2 cm was only 5 77 versus 82 while for those with tumors 2 cm it was 19 58 versus 77 Similarly the absolute 5-year survival benefit was less evident among patients with one nodal metastasis 79 versus 83 than when at least two nodes were positive 55 versus 75 In this exploratory hypothesis-generating analysis adding CT to RT after radical hysterectomy appears to provide a smaller absolute benefit when only one node is positive or when the tumor size is 2 cm Further study of the role of CT after radical hysterectomy in patients with a low risk of recurrence may be warranted,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[6, 894, 1992, 74, 29, 8, 373, 210, 384, 160, 1, 361, 1110, 121, 240, 15, 240, 56, 425, 4, 7, 479, 711, 2622, 2, 1110, 2048, 5, 109, 1110, 263, 502, 8726, 799, 15, 221, 1012, 6, 1645, 685, 59, 240, 425, 2, 6, 963, 2630, 2, 38, 130, 92, 822, 40, 464, 1, 146, 2630, 3013, 29, 1154, 2, 15266, 2, 38, 74, 11, 446, 29, 7, 5, 82, 16725, 3180, 15, 4088, 12, 73, 5, 240, 15, 240, 425, 540, 431, 81, 821, 349, 1404, 2345, 81, 821, 454, 27, 244, 9, 294, 410, 8, 880, 65, 10, 173, 408, 3, 1352, 302, 1000, 444, 383, 3, 3037, 1, 8, 331, 65, 1, 3, 8410, 346, 117, 6346, 240, 3790, 240, 425, 4080, 11, 859, 3, 2524, 254, 1, 249, 425, 10, 44, 1327, 41, 5, 69, 89, 1831, 267, 15, 30, 88, 3, 177, 724, 1, 1831, 267, 30, 444, 207, 1, 109, 502, 2, 8726, 2401, 4, 3, 240, 87, 10, 299, 2235, 198, 425, 10, 1953, 3, 1766, 767, 4, 33, 111, 25, 9, 249, 425, 4, 7, 5, 57, 15, 18, 494, 10, 158, 33, 849, 185, 878, 369, 9, 135, 5, 57, 18, 494, 192, 10, 326, 717, 185, 849, 1813, 3, 1766, 33, 111, 25, 247, 10, 299, 2853, 107, 7, 5, 104, 779, 278, 842, 185, 852, 76, 198, 28, 506, 100, 502, 11, 109, 614, 185, 481, 4, 26, 2386, 1492, 3997, 65, 2726, 425, 6, 240, 50, 711, 2622, 1233, 6, 377, 8, 2170, 1766, 247, 198, 158, 104, 289, 16, 109, 15, 198, 3, 30, 444, 16, 18, 494, 195, 45, 1, 3, 200, 1, 425, 50, 711, 2622, 4, 7, 5, 8, 154, 43, 1, 146, 68, 40, 1197]",1786.0,15721417,735
Clitoral therapy device for treatment of sexual dysfunction in irradiated cervical cancer patients.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2005-03-01,"The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy of the clitoral therapy device (Eros Therapy) in alleviating sexual dysfunction in irradiated cervical cancer patients. Eligible patients had a history of cervical cancer treated with radiotherapy and self-reported sexual dysfunction of sexual arousal and/or orgasmic disorders. Patients used the noninvasive, nonpharmacologic clitoral therapy device using a hand-held, battery-powered vacuum to cause clitoral engorgement four times weekly for 3 months during foreplay and self-stimulation. Study instruments included the Female Sexual Function Index, Derogatis Interview for Sexual Functioning, and Dyadic Adjustment Scale. The outcome evaluation was performed at 3 months. Between 2001 and 2002, 15 women were enrolled and 13 completed the study. The median patient age and radiotherapy-enrollment interval was 43.5 years and 2 years, respectively. At baseline, all patients reported symptoms of sexual arousal and/or orgasmic disorders, and some also had sexual desire and pain disorders. At 3 months, statistically significant improvements were seen in all domains tested, including sexual desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, sexual satisfaction, and reduced pain. The median Female Sexual Function Index total score increased from 17 to 29.4 (maximal score, 36; p <0.001). The median Derogatis Interview for Sexual Functioning total raw score increased from 46 to 95 (maximal score, 118; p <0.001). At baseline, the Derogatis Interview for Sexual Functioning total T-score corresponded to the bottom 10th percentile of normal sexual functioning. At 3 months, the total T-score placed the patients at the normalcy cutoff. Gynecologic examinations revealed improved mucosal color and moisture and vaginal elasticity and decreased bleeding and ulceration. Our results from this pilot study suggest that the clitoral therapy device may alleviate sexual dysfunction in irradiated cervical cancer patients.

Racial differences in the familial aggregation of breast cancer and other female cancers.,Breast cancer research and treatment,Breast Cancer Res. Treat.,2005-02-01,"Although breast cancer familial aggregation has been studied in Caucasians, information for African-Americans is scant. We used family cancer history from the Women's Contraceptive and Reproductive Experiences study to assess the aggregation of breast and gynecological cancers in African-American and Caucasian families. Information was available on 41,825 first and second-degree relatives of Caucasian and 28,956 relatives of African-American participants. We used a cohort approach in which the relative's cancer status was the outcome in unconditional logistic regression and adjusted for correlated data using generalized estimating equations. Race-specific models included a family history indicator, the relative's age, and type. Relative risk (RR) estimates for breast cancer were highest for first-degree relatives, and the overall RR for breast cancer among case relatives was 1.96 (95% CI = 1.68-2.30) for Caucasian and 1.78 (95% CI = 1.41-2.25) for African-Americans.

Pediatric radical abdominal trachelectomy for cervical clear cell carcinoma: a novel surgical approach.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2005-04-01,"Clear cell carcinoma of the cervix and vagina is rare in the pediatric population. Many of these tumors are associated with prior intrauterine diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure. All DES-associated tumors are believed to contain microsatellite instability (MI). Historically, the recommended treatment is radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy, which result in infertility in all cases. Radical abdominal or vaginal trachelectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection is a new technique utilized in adult women with early cervical cancer who wish to retain fertility. This novel approach is also pertinent to the pediatric patient and is described in this report. A molecular analysis is also performed to determine if these are DES-associated tumors. Due to the narrow vaginal anatomy in pediatric patients, a vaginal approach is not possible, and an abdominal approach is performed. The resection includes the cervix, upper vagina, parametrium, and paracolpos. Pelvic lymphadenectomy is performed in a similar manner to the adult patient. Matched pairs of normal and tumor DNA from both cases were examined for evidence of MI using a consensus panel of microsatellite markers. Two girls aged 6 and 8 years and without history of DES exposure presented with vaginal bleeding. Vaginoscopy revealed cervical polyp in both cases. Biopsies demonstrated clear cell cancer stage IB1 in both patients. They underwent radical abdominal trachelectomy and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection along with anastomosis of uterine isthmus to upper vagina. Intraoperative frozen-section analysis confirmed negative uterine and vaginal margins. No adjuvant treatment was given and both girls remain disease free. Neither tumor showed evidence for MI, confirming that these are not DES-associated tumors. To our knowledge, this is the first report of radical abdominal trachelectomy in the pediatric age group and it is likely to include the youngest patient with clear cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix not associated with DES exposure. This novel approach is feasible and appears safe in the pediatric age group.",Case Reports,5408.0,27.0,Clear cell carcinoma of the cervix and vagina is rare in the pediatric population Many of these tumors are associated with prior intrauterine diethylstilbestrol DES exposure All DES-associated tumors are believed to contain microsatellite instability MI Historically the recommended treatment is radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy which result in infertility in all cases Radical abdominal or trachelectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection is a new technique utilized in adult women with early cancer who wish to retain fertility This novel approach is also pertinent to the pediatric patient and is described in this report A molecular analysis is also performed to determine if these are DES-associated tumors Due to the narrow anatomy in pediatric patients a approach is not possible and an abdominal approach is performed The resection includes the cervix upper vagina parametrium and paracolpos Pelvic lymphadenectomy is performed in a similar manner to the adult patient Matched pairs of normal and tumor DNA from both cases were examined for evidence of MI using a consensus panel of microsatellite markers Two girls aged 6 and 8 years and without history of DES exposure presented with bleeding Vaginoscopy revealed polyp in both cases Biopsies demonstrated clear cell cancer stage IB1 in both patients They underwent radical abdominal trachelectomy and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection along with anastomosis of isthmus to upper vagina Intraoperative frozen-section analysis confirmed negative and margins No adjuvant treatment was given and both girls remain disease free Neither tumor showed evidence for MI confirming that these are not DES-associated tumors To our knowledge this is the first report of radical abdominal trachelectomy in the pediatric age group and it is likely to include the youngest patient with clear cell carcinoma of the cervix not associated with DES exposure This novel approach is feasible and appears safe in the pediatric age group,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[885, 31, 134, 1, 3, 3629, 2, 7553, 16, 622, 4, 3, 815, 266, 445, 1, 46, 57, 32, 41, 5, 324, 18242, 15522, 8683, 645, 62, 8683, 41, 57, 32, 3979, 6, 3725, 2226, 1753, 6862, 3578, 3, 793, 24, 16, 711, 2622, 2, 1110, 2048, 92, 757, 4, 5901, 4, 62, 140, 711, 1467, 15, 5760, 2, 1110, 263, 289, 1161, 16, 8, 217, 1312, 2080, 4, 780, 117, 5, 191, 12, 54, 11443, 6, 6630, 2954, 26, 229, 353, 16, 120, 5799, 6, 3, 815, 69, 2, 16, 1027, 4, 26, 414, 8, 219, 65, 16, 120, 173, 6, 223, 492, 46, 32, 8683, 41, 57, 520, 6, 3, 6958, 5081, 4, 815, 7, 8, 353, 16, 44, 899, 2, 35, 1467, 353, 16, 173, 3, 170, 1920, 3, 3629, 1726, 7553, 30751, 2, 54700, 1110, 2048, 16, 173, 4, 8, 288, 1708, 6, 3, 780, 69, 655, 2773, 1, 295, 2, 30, 261, 29, 110, 140, 11, 409, 9, 241, 1, 6862, 75, 8, 1391, 993, 1, 2226, 525, 100, 5989, 1032, 49, 2, 66, 60, 2, 187, 532, 1, 8683, 645, 917, 5, 2294, 43902, 553, 6493, 4, 110, 140, 1154, 264, 885, 31, 12, 82, 8111, 4, 110, 7, 491, 208, 711, 1467, 5760, 2, 1607, 1110, 263, 289, 1161, 1510, 5, 5519, 1, 54701, 6, 1726, 7553, 1720, 3015, 2917, 65, 557, 199, 2, 1012, 77, 249, 24, 10, 447, 2, 110, 5989, 918, 34, 115, 2174, 30, 224, 241, 9, 6862, 5030, 17, 46, 32, 44, 8683, 41, 57, 6, 114, 922, 26, 16, 3, 157, 414, 1, 711, 1467, 5760, 4, 3, 815, 89, 87, 2, 192, 16, 322, 6, 643, 3, 13042, 69, 5, 885, 31, 134, 1, 3, 3629, 44, 41, 5, 8683, 645, 26, 229, 353, 16, 1313, 2, 1233, 1165, 4, 3, 815, 89, 87]",1991.0,15790482,480
Operative management of metastatic and malignant primary subaxial cervical tumors.,Journal of neurosurgery. Spine,J Neurosurg Spine,2005-03-01,"The authors describe the preoperative assessment, intraoperative strategies, and long-term outcomes in 41 consecutive patients who underwent spinal reconstruction after resection of subaxial cervical neoplasms. Thirty-three tumors were metastatic and eight were primary. Preoperative studies included direct laryngoscopy and vertebral artery (VA) balloon occlusion tests in selected patients. Based on the tumor location, approaches included 12 anterior, 13 posterior, and 16 combined. All patients underwent aggressive intralesional resection and spinal reconstruction. In 12 patients, the VA was dissected from the periphery of the tumor, two cases of which required ligation. Fibula allograft and an anterior rigid plate fixation were most commonly used for anterior reconstruction. Posterior reconstruction was initially performed using lateral mass plates (LMPs) in 13 patients and screw/rod systems in the remaining patients. At follow up, pain level improved to mild or was absent in 39 patients (95%) who had presented with moderate or severe pain. The American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Scale scores were stable in 25 patients who presented with ASIA Score E and improved in 14 patients (88%) who presented with ASIA Score B, C, or D. Functional radiculopathy significantly improved in 16 (94%) of 17 patients. Complications occurred in 10 patients (24%) and included three fixation failures requiring revision.

Quality of life data were obtained using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale and Functional Assessment for Cancer Therapy, which included a subscale for cervical cancer. Twenty of 23 enrolled patients were evaluable for response. Stable disease was noted in 5 patients, with a median duration of response of 3.5 months (range, 3-6.5 months). No partial or complete responses were seen. Common grade 3 toxicities were fatigue (30.4%); abdominal pain, constipation, hand-foot syndrome, nausea, and vomiting (8.7% each); as well as dyspnea, headache, and coagulopathy (4.3% each). There were no grade 4 toxicities. All patients with previous exposure to infused 5-FU had evidence of progression. No statistically significant changes in quality of life were noted from baseline to post-cycle 2.

To evaluate the validity of assessing gene expression in cervical tissues acquired in a clinical setting, we investigated whether standard procedures, namely the application of acetic acid and/or Lugol's iodine, employed for the visualization of colposcopically directed biopsies, altered patterns in oligonucleotide (oligo) arrays. We compared microarray profiles from six women, each with three adjacent tissue samples removed from benign hysterectomy specimens and treated as follows: immediately frozen, acetic acid application only, acetic acid, and Lugol's iodine. Of the 22,464 original spots on the microarray, 4,850 spots were expressed at detectable levels for further evaluation upon data normalization and filtration. For each spot, the difference between topical applications was computed, and P values were calculated using a bivariate T2 test.

Clin. Oncol.,2005-05-23,"To prospectively assess the impact of treatment with cisplatin alone or in combination with topotecan (CT) on quality of life (QOL) in patients with advanced or recurrent cervical cancer, and to explore the prognostic value of baseline QOL scores. Patients entered on Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) Protocol 179 were expected to complete QOL assessments at four time points using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G), Cervix subscale (Cx subscale), FACT/GOG-Neurotoxicity subscale (NTX subscale), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), and UNISCALE (UNI). Adjusting for patient age, baseline scores, and effects of time, we longitudinally examined treatment effect on QOL during and after chemotherapy. Among patients randomly allocated to receive cisplatin (n = 146) or CT (n = 147), there were no statistically significant differences in QOL up to 9 months after randomization despite more hematologic toxicity in the combination arm. QOL assessments were completed at rates of 98%, 85%, 68%, and 59%, respectively, for the four time points, with similar rates and reasons for nonparticipation between regimens. Baseline FACT-G (P = .0016) and BPI (P = .0001) scores were significantly associated with patient age; older patients had better QOL and less pain.

"Hormonal contraceptive use, pregnancy and parity, and the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 among oncogenic HPV DNA-positive women with equivocal or mildly abnormal cytology.",International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2005-12-01,"Oral contraceptive (OC) use, hormonal contraceptive use and multiparity are potential risk factors for cervical precancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN3), but a limited number of studies have adequately accounted for possible confounding effect of oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. To examine the relationships of these factors with CIN3, we conducted an analysis of women (n = 5,060) with minimally abnormal Pap smears who were enrolled in the ASCUS and LSIL Triage Study (ALTS), a clinical trial to evaluate management strategies. Cervical specimens collected at enrollment were tested for HPV DNA using 2 methods. Multivariate logistics regression models were used to assess associations (odds ratio [OR] with 95% confidence intervals [CI]) of the potential risk factors (e.g., OC use and parity) with testing oncogenic HPV positive among controls (<CIN2) (n = 4,114) and with rigorously reviewed cases of CIN3 identified throughout the study (n = 499) among women with oncogenic HPV (n = 3,126). Only former oral contraceptive use (OR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.0-1.7) was associated marginally with having an oncogenic HPV infection among controls. Restricted to women with oncogenic HPV, current injectable hormonal contraceptive users were at an elevated risk of CIN3 (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.2-2.1) compared to women who never used them. Similarly, restricted to women with HPV16 infection, current users of injectable contraceptives were at a marginally elevated risk of CIN3 (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0-2.3) compared to women who never used them. Oral contraceptive use, Norplant (implantable hormonal contraceptive) use, a history of pregnancy, age at first pregnancy, lifetime numbers of pregnancies and lifetime numbers of live births were not associated with CIN3. We conclude that only current injectable hormonal contraceptive use slightly elevated the risk (approximately 50%) of CIN3 in this young and low parity population of women with oncogenic HPV and minimally abnormal Pap smears but further confirmation of this relationship is needed.",Journal Article,5164.0,30.0,"Oral contraceptive OC use hormonal contraceptive use and multiparity are potential risk factors for precancer intraepithelial neoplasia 3 CIN3 but a limited number of studies have adequately accounted for possible confounding effect of oncogenic human papillomavirus HPV infection To examine the relationships of these factors with CIN3 we conducted an analysis of women n 5,060 with minimally abnormal Pap smears who were enrolled in the ASCUS and LSIL Triage Study ALTS a clinical trial to evaluate management strategies specimens collected at enrollment were tested for HPV DNA using 2 methods Multivariate logistics regression models were used to assess associations odds ratio OR with 95 confidence intervals CI of the potential risk factors e.g. OC use and parity with testing oncogenic HPV positive among controls CIN2 n 4,114 and with rigorously reviewed cases of CIN3 identified throughout the study n 499 among women with oncogenic HPV n 3,126 Only former oral contraceptive use OR 1.3 95 CI 1.0-1.7 was associated marginally with having an oncogenic HPV infection among controls Restricted to women with oncogenic HPV current injectable hormonal contraceptive users were at an elevated risk of CIN3 OR 1.6 95 CI 1.2-2.1 compared to women who never used them Similarly restricted to women with HPV16 infection current users of injectable contraceptives were at a marginally elevated risk of CIN3 OR 1.5 95 CI 1.0-2.3 compared to women who never used them Oral contraceptive use Norplant implantable hormonal contraceptive use a history of pregnancy age at first pregnancy lifetime numbers of pregnancies and lifetime numbers of live births were not associated with CIN3 We conclude that only current injectable hormonal contraceptive use slightly elevated the risk approximately 50 of CIN3 in this young and low parity population of women with oncogenic HPV and minimally abnormal Pap smears but further confirmation of this relationship is needed",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[518, 6780, 2950, 119, 1761, 6780, 119, 2, 28425, 32, 174, 43, 130, 9, 12380, 4153, 2298, 27, 10346, 84, 8, 383, 207, 1, 94, 47, 4215, 3688, 9, 899, 4339, 254, 1, 1302, 171, 3242, 933, 930, 6, 1004, 3, 2467, 1, 46, 130, 5, 10346, 21, 426, 35, 65, 1, 117, 78, 33, 9972, 5, 2144, 1668, 4290, 8916, 54, 11, 346, 4, 3, 21337, 2, 17849, 9059, 45, 26252, 8, 38, 160, 6, 376, 284, 422, 623, 786, 28, 1798, 11, 650, 9, 933, 261, 75, 18, 636, 331, 17179, 320, 274, 11, 95, 6, 423, 685, 610, 197, 15, 5, 48, 307, 1582, 58, 1, 3, 174, 43, 130, 563, 499, 2950, 119, 2, 5754, 5, 471, 1302, 933, 109, 107, 535, 12870, 78, 39, 3803, 2, 5, 10347, 446, 140, 1, 10346, 108, 2432, 3, 45, 78, 11673, 107, 117, 5, 1302, 933, 78, 27, 3927, 158, 3623, 518, 6780, 119, 15, 14, 27, 48, 58, 14, 13, 14, 67, 10, 41, 5007, 5, 1041, 35, 1302, 933, 930, 107, 535, 2016, 6, 117, 5, 1302, 933, 291, 11652, 1761, 6780, 2735, 11, 28, 35, 804, 43, 1, 10346, 15, 14, 49, 48, 58, 14, 18, 18, 14, 72, 6, 117, 54, 1737, 95, 1370, 1813, 2016, 6, 117, 5, 4048, 930, 291, 2735, 1, 11652, 9445, 11, 28, 8, 5007, 804, 43, 1, 10346, 15, 14, 33, 48, 58, 14, 13, 18, 27, 72, 6, 117, 54, 1737, 95, 1370, 518, 6780, 119, 54901, 14818, 1761, 6780, 119, 8, 532, 1, 2290, 89, 28, 157, 2290, 2898, 1870, 1, 8746, 2, 2898, 1870, 1, 3812, 9951, 11, 44, 41, 5, 10346, 21, 2060, 17, 158, 291, 11652, 1761, 6780, 119, 3223, 804, 3, 43, 705, 212, 1, 10346, 4, 26, 1169, 2, 154, 5754, 266, 1, 117, 5, 1302, 933, 2, 2144, 1668, 4290, 8916, 84, 195, 3551, 1, 26, 858, 16, 575]",1957.0,15986443,244
Intensity-modulated radiation therapy after hysterectomy: comparison with conventional treatment and sensitivity of the normal-tissue-sparing effect to margin size.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2005-07-01,"To determine the influence of target-volume expansion on the reduction in small-bowel dose achieved with use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) vs. standard conformal treatment of the pelvis after hysterectomy, and to investigate the influence of patient body habitus on the normal-tissue sparing achieved with use of IMRT. A clinical target volume (CTV) was contoured on each of 10 planning computed tomography scans of patients who had been treated for cervical or endometrial cancer after a hysterectomy. Treatment planning was based on vaginal CTVs and regional nodal CTVs. To account for internal motion, margins were added to form an initial planning target volume (PTVA) as follows: 0.0 mm were added to the regional nodal CTV; 10 mm were added anteriorly to the vaginal CTV; and 5 mm were added to the vaginal CTV in all other directions. Two further PTVs (PTVB and PTVC) were produced by a 5-mm expansion of PTVA to give PTVB and a further 5-mm expansion to give PTVC. Treatment plans for all 3 PTVs were produced by use of 2 conformal fields (2FC), 4 conformal fields (4FC), or IMRT to deliver 45 Gy to more than 97% of the PTV. The primary goal of IMRT was to spare small bowel. The change in sparing that accompanied the increase in margin size was assessed by comparison of dose-volume histograms that resulted from PTVA, PTVB, and PTVC. Measured patient dimensions were correlated with bowel sparing. Significantly less small bowel was irradiated by IMRT than by 2FC (p < 0.0001) or 4FC (p < 0.0001) for doses greater than 25 Gy. Significantly less rectum was irradiated by IMRT than by 2FC (p < 0.0001) or 4FC (p < 0.0001). Significantly less bladder was irradiated by IMRT than by 2FC (p < 0.0001). However, the magnitude of the sparing achieved by use of IMRT decreased as margins increased. In particular, the volume of small bowel spared by IMRT vs. 2FC or 4FC decreased as margin size increased (p = 0.0002 and p = 0.008 for 2FC and 4FC, respectively). The amount of normal-tissue sparing achieved by use of IMRT vs. 4FC was inversely correlated with patient body mass index. Because the small-bowel sparing achieved with use of IMRT is markedly reduced by relatively small expansions of the target volume, accurate target delineation, highly reproducible patient immobilization, and a clear understanding of internal-organ motion are needed to achieve optimal advantage in the use of IMRT over conventional methods of posthysterectomy pelvic radiation therapy.",Comparative Study,5317.0,106.0,To determine the influence of target-volume expansion on the reduction in small-bowel dose achieved with use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy IMRT vs. standard conformal treatment of the pelvis after hysterectomy and to investigate the influence of patient body habitus on the normal-tissue sparing achieved with use of IMRT A clinical target volume CTV was contoured on each of 10 planning computed tomography scans of patients who had been treated for or cancer after a hysterectomy Treatment planning was based on CTVs and regional nodal CTVs To account for internal motion margins were added to form an initial planning target volume PTVA as follows 0.0 mm were added to the regional nodal CTV 10 mm were added anteriorly to the CTV and 5 mm were added to the CTV in all other directions Two further PTVs PTVB and PTVC were produced by a 5-mm expansion of PTVA to give PTVB and a further 5-mm expansion to give PTVC Treatment plans for all 3 PTVs were produced by use of 2 conformal fields 2FC 4 conformal fields 4FC or IMRT to deliver 45 Gy to more than 97 of the PTV The primary goal of IMRT was to spare small bowel The change in sparing that accompanied the increase in margin size was assessed by comparison of dose-volume histograms that resulted from PTVA PTVB and PTVC Measured patient dimensions were correlated with bowel sparing Significantly less small bowel was irradiated by IMRT than by 2FC p 0.0001 or 4FC p 0.0001 for doses greater than 25 Gy Significantly less rectum was irradiated by IMRT than by 2FC p 0.0001 or 4FC p 0.0001 Significantly less was irradiated by IMRT than by 2FC p 0.0001 However the magnitude of the sparing achieved by use of IMRT decreased as margins increased In particular the volume of small bowel spared by IMRT vs. 2FC or 4FC decreased as margin size increased p 0.0002 and p 0.008 for 2FC and 4FC respectively The amount of normal-tissue sparing achieved by use of IMRT vs. 4FC was inversely correlated with patient body mass index Because the small-bowel sparing achieved with use of IMRT is markedly reduced by relatively small expansions of the target volume accurate target delineation highly reproducible patient immobilization and a clear understanding of internal-organ motion are needed to achieve optimal advantage in the use of IMRT over conventional methods of posthysterectomy pelvic radiation therapy,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[6, 223, 3, 1054, 1, 283, 433, 1422, 23, 3, 628, 4, 302, 1659, 61, 513, 5, 119, 1, 837, 1757, 121, 36, 964, 105, 260, 2972, 24, 1, 3, 3270, 50, 2622, 2, 6, 963, 3, 1054, 1, 69, 642, 23459, 23, 3, 295, 246, 1851, 513, 5, 119, 1, 964, 8, 38, 283, 433, 3402, 10, 6476, 23, 296, 1, 79, 1349, 1220, 872, 1441, 1, 7, 54, 42, 85, 73, 9, 15, 12, 50, 8, 2622, 24, 1349, 10, 90, 23, 14256, 2, 951, 779, 14256, 6, 1967, 9, 2329, 2967, 1012, 11, 1953, 6, 1297, 35, 388, 1349, 283, 433, 37953, 22, 2962, 13, 13, 321, 11, 1953, 6, 3, 951, 779, 3402, 79, 321, 11, 1953, 22232, 6, 3, 3402, 2, 33, 321, 11, 1953, 6, 3, 3402, 4, 62, 127, 3540, 100, 195, 13631, 37954, 2, 37955, 11, 1687, 20, 8, 33, 321, 1422, 1, 37953, 6, 4978, 37954, 2, 8, 195, 33, 321, 1422, 6, 4978, 37955, 24, 1853, 9, 62, 27, 13631, 11, 1687, 20, 119, 1, 18, 2972, 3130, 26413, 39, 2972, 3130, 28426, 15, 964, 6, 3392, 512, 381, 6, 80, 76, 1015, 1, 3, 3303, 3, 86, 1326, 1, 964, 10, 6, 8539, 302, 1659, 3, 707, 4, 1851, 17, 2756, 3, 344, 4, 959, 444, 10, 275, 20, 1155, 1, 61, 433, 8638, 17, 627, 29, 37953, 37954, 2, 37955, 644, 69, 6190, 11, 438, 5, 1659, 1851, 97, 299, 302, 1659, 10, 2398, 20, 964, 76, 20, 26413, 19, 13, 488, 15, 28426, 19, 13, 488, 9, 415, 378, 76, 243, 381, 97, 299, 3660, 10, 2398, 20, 964, 76, 20, 26413, 19, 13, 488, 15, 28426, 19, 13, 488, 97, 299, 10, 2398, 20, 964, 76, 20, 26413, 19, 13, 488, 137, 3, 3131, 1, 3, 1851, 513, 20, 119, 1, 964, 340, 22, 1012, 101, 4, 1454, 3, 433, 1, 302, 1659, 6830, 20, 964, 105, 26413, 15, 28426, 340, 22, 959, 444, 101, 19, 13, 3531, 2, 19, 13, 2155, 9, 26413, 2, 28426, 106, 3, 3108, 1, 295, 246, 1851, 513, 20, 119, 1, 964, 105, 28426, 10, 2659, 438, 5, 69, 642, 782, 558, 408, 3, 302, 1659, 1851, 513, 5, 119, 1, 964, 16, 2195, 405, 20, 1352, 302, 12384, 1, 3, 283, 433, 1481, 283, 5529, 561, 4172, 69, 10161, 2, 8, 885, 612, 1, 2329, 1259, 2967, 32, 575, 6, 1359, 665, 1874, 4, 3, 119, 1, 964, 252, 809, 636, 1, 33916, 1110, 121, 36]",2371.0,15990017,723
Vaccines against human papillomavirus and cervical cancer: promises and challenges.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2005-08-01,"Cervical cancer and precancerous lesions of the genital tract are major threats to the health of women worldwide. The introduction of screening tests to detect cervical cancer precursor lesions has reduced cervical cancer rates in the developed world, but not in developing countries. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the primary etiologic agent of cervical cancer and dysplasia. Thus, cervical cancer and other HPV-associated malignancies might be prevented or treated by HPV vaccines. Two vaccine strategies have been developed. First, prevention of HPV infection through induction of capsid-specific neutralizing antibodies has been studied in clinical trials. However, because the capsid proteins are not expressed at detectable levels by infected basal keratinocytes or in HPV-transformed cells, a second approach of developing therapeutic vaccines by targeting nonstructural early viral antigens has also been developed. Because two HPV oncogenic proteins, E6 and E7, are critical to the induction and maintenance of cellular transformation and are coexpressed in the majority of HPV-containing carcinomas, most therapeutic vaccines target one or both of these gene products. A variety of approaches is being tested in therapeutic vaccine clinical trials, whereby E6 and/or E7 are administered in live vectors, as peptides or protein, in nucleic acid form, or in cell-based vaccines. The paradigm of preventing HPV infection through vaccination has been tested, and two vaccines are currently in phase III clinical trials. However, current therapeutic vaccine trials are less mature with respect to disease clearance. A number of approaches have shown significant therapeutic benefit in preclinical papillomavirus models and await testing in patient populations to determine the most effective curative strategy.",Journal Article,5286.0,95.0,cancer and precancerous lesions of the genital tract are major threats to the health of women worldwide The introduction of screening tests to detect cancer precursor lesions has reduced cancer rates in the developed world but not in developing countries Human papillomavirus HPV is the primary etiologic agent of cancer and dysplasia Thus cancer and other HPV-associated malignancies might be prevented or treated by HPV vaccines Two vaccine strategies have been developed First prevention of HPV infection through induction of capsid-specific neutralizing antibodies has been studied in clinical trials However because the capsid proteins are not expressed at detectable levels by infected basal keratinocytes or in HPV-transformed cells a second approach of developing therapeutic vaccines by targeting nonstructural early viral antigens has also been developed Because two HPV oncogenic proteins E6 and E7 are critical to the induction and maintenance of cellular transformation and are coexpressed in the majority of HPV-containing carcinomas most therapeutic vaccines target one or both of these gene products A variety of approaches is being tested in therapeutic vaccine clinical trials whereby E6 and/or E7 are administered in live vectors as peptides or protein in nucleic acid form or in cell-based vaccines The paradigm of preventing HPV infection through vaccination has been tested and two vaccines are currently in phase III clinical trials However current therapeutic vaccine trials are less mature with respect to disease clearance A number of approaches have shown significant therapeutic benefit in preclinical papillomavirus models and await testing in patient populations to determine the most effective curative strategy,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[12, 2, 6605, 406, 1, 3, 8226, 1696, 32, 458, 22312, 6, 3, 341, 1, 117, 2358, 3, 2456, 1, 453, 895, 6, 1426, 12, 2765, 406, 71, 405, 12, 151, 4, 3, 276, 1956, 84, 44, 4, 931, 2115, 171, 3242, 933, 16, 3, 86, 6604, 420, 1, 12, 2, 2253, 631, 12, 2, 127, 933, 41, 441, 822, 40, 3902, 15, 73, 20, 933, 1842, 100, 1274, 422, 47, 85, 276, 157, 1070, 1, 933, 930, 298, 504, 1, 17237, 112, 5788, 890, 71, 85, 656, 4, 38, 143, 137, 408, 3, 17237, 652, 32, 44, 570, 28, 2083, 148, 20, 3369, 2135, 9587, 15, 4, 933, 2423, 37, 8, 419, 353, 1, 931, 189, 1842, 20, 529, 44072, 191, 1667, 1575, 71, 120, 85, 276, 408, 100, 933, 1302, 652, 4837, 2, 4540, 32, 740, 6, 3, 504, 2, 1146, 1, 763, 1392, 2, 32, 10185, 4, 3, 686, 1, 933, 1101, 826, 96, 189, 1842, 283, 104, 15, 110, 1, 46, 145, 2766, 8, 1362, 1, 611, 16, 486, 650, 4, 189, 1274, 38, 143, 6131, 4837, 2, 15, 4540, 32, 468, 4, 3812, 5453, 22, 2491, 15, 178, 4, 7895, 971, 1297, 15, 4, 31, 90, 1842, 3, 2431, 1, 3017, 933, 930, 298, 1915, 71, 85, 650, 2, 100, 1842, 32, 694, 4, 124, 316, 38, 143, 137, 291, 189, 1274, 143, 32, 299, 2908, 5, 2184, 6, 34, 1960, 8, 207, 1, 611, 47, 443, 93, 189, 247, 4, 693, 3242, 274, 2, 12095, 471, 4, 69, 1184, 6, 223, 3, 96, 323, 1075, 692]",1742.0,16079320,46

Viable primary untreated cervical cancer specimens were obtained and exposed to gamma irradiation at a dose of 3 Gy in the IVRRA to determine in vitro radiation sensitivity. RNA was purified for microarray analysis with the Affymetrix Human Genome U95A Array carrying more than 12,000 gene probes. Gene expression analysis was performed, and specimen transcript patterns were correlated with radiation response using an iteration analysis model and Pearson's correlation coefficient. A feasibility set of eight tumor specimens was studied. Tumors were classified into 4 extreme (ERR), 2 intermediate (IRR) and 2 low radiation resistance (LRR) categories. An intrinsic radiation response gene set of 54 genes transcripts with 100% accuracy for the classification of each tumor's radiation response category was identified. Gene sets associated with in vitro radiation response profiles in cervical cancer can be generated using the IVRRA and microarray technology.

Fifty-five patients with stages I-IVA cervical carcinoma were treated with definitive radiotherapy. Tumor expression of each biomarker was quantitatively scored by an automated immunohistochemical imaging system. Parametric correlations were performed between biomarkers. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) as primary endpoints. Correlations were observed between expression of HER2 and HER4 (P = 0.003), and HER3 and HER4 (P = 0.004). Decreased HER2, HER4, and P-Akt expressions were significant for diminished DFS on univariate analysis (P = 0.04, P = 0.008, and P = 0.02, respectively). Increased EGFR, and diminished HER2, HER4, and P-Akt expression were significant or showed trends toward significance for diminished OS on univariate analysis (P = 0.07, P = 0.008, P = 0.09, and P = 0.08, respectively). After controlling for pretreatment factors, multivariate analysis revealed HER2 associated with improved OS (P = 0.05).

A three-dimensional computed tomography-assisted Monte Carlo evaluation of ovoid shielding on the dose to the bladder and rectum in intracavitary radiotherapy for cervical cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2005-10-01,"To determine the effects of Fletcher Suit Delclos ovoid shielding on dose to the bladder and rectum during intracavitary radiotherapy for cervical cancer. The Monte Carlo method was used to calculate the dose in 12 patients receiving low-dose-rate intracavitary radiotherapy with both shielded and unshielded ovoids. Cumulative dose-difference surface histograms were computed for the bladder and rectum. Doses to the 2-cm(3) and 5-cm(3) volumes of highest dose were computed for the bladder and rectum with and without shielding. Shielding affected dose to the 2-cm(3) and 5-cm(3) volumes of highest dose for the rectum (10.1% and 11.1% differences, respectively). Shielding did not have a major impact on the dose to the 2-cm(3) and 5-cm(3) volumes of highest dose for the bladder. The average dose reduction to 5% of the surface area of the bladder was 53 cGy. Reductions as large as 150 cGy were observed to 5% of the surface area of the bladder. The average dose reduction to 5% of the surface area of the rectum was 195 cGy. Reductions as large as 405 cGy were observed to 5% of the surface area of the rectum. Our data suggest that the ovoid shields can greatly reduce the radiation dose delivered to the rectum.

Gynecologic oncology group trials of chemotherapy for metastatic and recurrent cervical cancer.,Current oncology reports,Curr Oncol Rep,2005-11-01,"Because only 16% of patients with metastatic cervical cancer are alive 5 years after diagnosis, the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) has carefully designed and conducted many phase II studies to identify promising drugs. Cisplatin has emerged as the most active single agent with overall response rates of 19%. Recent phase III trials have documented response rates of 27% and 39% when cisplatin has been combined with either paclitaxel or topotecan, respectively.

Randomized comparison of weekly cisplatin or protracted venous infusion of fluorouracil in combination with pelvic radiation in advanced cervix cancer: a gynecologic oncology group study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2005-10-17,"Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard of care for locally advanced cervix cancer; the optimal chemotherapy regimen is not yet defined. This trial was designed to compare the outcome of protracted venous infusion (PVI) fluorouracil (FU) with standard weekly cisplatin and concurrent radiation therapy (RT). Patients with stage IIB, IIIB, and IVA cervical cancer with clinically negative aortic nodes were eligible. Pelvic RT dose was 45 Gy with a parametrial boost to involved sides of 5.4 to 9 Gy, and high- or low-dose rate intracavitary brachytherapy. Standard therapy was weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2, and experimental therapy was PVI FU 225 mg/m2/d for 5 d/wk for six cycles during RT. The study was closed prematurely when a planned interim futility analysis indicated that PVI FU/RT had a higher treatment failure rate (35% higher) and would, most likely, not result in an improvement in progression-free survival compared with weekly cisplatin/RT. The PVI FU/RT arm continues to show a higher risk of treatment failure (relative risk [RR] unadjusted, 1.29) and a higher mortality rate (RR unadjusted, 1.37). There was no difference in pelvic treatment failure between regimens, but there was an increase in the failure rate at distant sites in the PVI FU arm. In this study, PVI FU does not show improved outcome over weekly cisplatin. Future research should explore combinations of FU with cisplatin, new radiosensitizers, and active drugs combined with RT to reduce the high rate of pelvic and distant treatment failure still seen in advanced cervix cancer.","Clinical Trial, Phase III",5209.0,136.0,Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard of care for locally advanced cervix cancer the optimal chemotherapy regimen is not yet defined This trial was designed to compare the outcome of protracted venous infusion PVI fluorouracil FU with standard weekly cisplatin and concurrent radiation therapy RT Patients with stage IIB IIIB and IVA cancer with clinically negative aortic nodes were eligible Pelvic RT dose was 45 Gy with a parametrial boost to involved sides of 5.4 to 9 Gy and high- or low-dose rate intracavitary brachytherapy Standard therapy was weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2 and experimental therapy was PVI FU 225 mg/m2/d for 5 d/wk for six cycles during RT The study was closed prematurely when a planned interim futility analysis indicated that PVI FU/RT had a higher treatment failure rate 35 higher and would most likely not result in an improvement in progression-free survival compared with weekly cisplatin/RT The PVI FU/RT arm continues to show a higher risk of treatment failure relative risk RR unadjusted 1.29 and a higher mortality rate RR unadjusted 1.37 There was no difference in pelvic treatment failure between regimens but there was an increase in the failure rate at distant sites in the PVI FU arm In this study PVI FU does not show improved outcome over weekly cisplatin Future research should explore combinations of FU with cisplatin new radiosensitizers and active drugs combined with RT to reduce the high rate of pelvic and distant treatment failure still seen in advanced cervix cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[750, 1464, 16, 3, 260, 1, 165, 9, 795, 131, 3629, 12, 3, 665, 56, 477, 16, 44, 1145, 395, 26, 160, 10, 1114, 6, 932, 3, 228, 1, 7053, 2167, 904, 16419, 1404, 1296, 5, 260, 709, 540, 2, 750, 121, 36, 240, 7, 5, 82, 3884, 3036, 2, 5900, 12, 5, 505, 199, 3938, 502, 11, 625, 1110, 240, 61, 10, 512, 381, 5, 8, 8726, 2569, 6, 646, 10958, 1, 33, 39, 6, 83, 381, 2, 64, 15, 154, 61, 116, 9122, 1536, 260, 36, 10, 709, 540, 327, 81, 821, 2, 1560, 36, 10, 16419, 1296, 4011, 81, 821, 427, 9, 33, 427, 3293, 9, 437, 410, 190, 240, 3, 45, 10, 3745, 9771, 198, 8, 1465, 2914, 7566, 65, 1103, 17, 16419, 1296, 240, 42, 8, 142, 24, 496, 116, 465, 142, 2, 688, 96, 322, 44, 757, 4, 35, 767, 4, 91, 115, 25, 72, 5, 709, 540, 240, 3, 16419, 1296, 240, 475, 2274, 6, 514, 8, 142, 43, 1, 24, 496, 580, 43, 861, 4487, 14, 462, 2, 8, 142, 282, 116, 861, 4487, 14, 567, 125, 10, 77, 523, 4, 1110, 24, 496, 59, 472, 84, 125, 10, 35, 344, 4, 3, 496, 116, 28, 626, 633, 4, 3, 16419, 1296, 475, 4, 26, 45, 16419, 1296, 1097, 44, 514, 231, 228, 252, 709, 540, 508, 389, 257, 1645, 1247, 1, 1296, 5, 540, 217, 11763, 2, 544, 600, 397, 5, 240, 6, 969, 3, 64, 116, 1, 1110, 2, 626, 24, 496, 1234, 527, 4, 131, 3629, 12]",1523.0,16230678,132

Women were interviewed at least 5 years after initial treatment for cervical cancer. Eligible women had squamous cell tumors smaller than 6 cm at diagnosis, were currently disease-free, and had either undergone surgery or radiotherapy, but not both. The two treatment groups were then compared using univariate analysis and multivariate linear regression with a control group of age- and race-matched women with no history of cancer. One hundred fourteen patients (37 surgery, 37 radiotherapy, 40 controls) were included for analysis. When compared with surgery patients and controls using univariate analysis, radiation patients had significantly poorer scores on standardized questionnaires measuring health-related quality of life (physical and mental health), psychosocial distress and sexual functioning. The disparity in sexual function remained significant in a multivariate analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses did not show significant differences between radical hysterectomy patients and controls on any of the outcome measures.

"Long-segment, supercharged, pedicled jejunal flap for total esophageal reconstruction.",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg.,2005-10-13,"Many patients with cancer have limited esophageal reconstruction options when the stomach is unavailable as a replacement conduit or when long-segment discontinuity exists. Jejunum has been used as an alternative conduit, both as a pedicled or free flap interposition; however, reports of this are usually limited to short-segment repairs. Microvascular augmentation of a pedicled jejunal flap allows creation of a longer conduit, making it possible to replace the entire esophagus with jejunum. Few reports describe this technique in patients with cancer. We report our initial experience with ""supercharged"" pedicled jejunum as an alternative conduit for total esophageal reconstruction. Review of a prospectively collected departmental database was performed to identify those patients who underwent total esophageal reconstruction with supercharged pedicled jejunum. Data regarding their perioperative course and postoperative function were gathered from the prospectively collected clinical data, review of hospital records, and patient interviews. Total esophageal reconstruction with supercharged pedicled jejunum was attempted in 26 patients (age range, 37-74 years) between March 2000 and April 2004. Twenty-four of 26 patients were ultimately discharged with an intact supercharged pedicled jejunum flap, for an overall success rate of 92.3%. One patient experienced intraoperative flap loss caused by technical difficulties harvesting the flap and never had the flap interposed. One other flap loss occurred in the early postoperative period in a patient who had multisystem organ failure after a prolonged reconstruction. Cervical anastomotic leaks occurred in 19.2% (5/26) of the patients. Two midconduit leaks occurred that were suspicious for iatrogenic perforation from nasogastric tube placement; one required reoperation. One additional early reoperation was performed for cecal ischemia. There were no mortalities. Functional results were available in 95.4% (21/22) of the patients receiving supercharged pedicled jejunum who survived at least 6 months after reconstruction. At the time of follow-up, 95% (20/21) of the patients were tolerating regular diet, and 76.2% (16/21) did not require any supplemental alimentation. Ninety-five percent (20/21) of the patients were free from reflux symptoms, and 80.9% (17/21) had no dumping symptoms. Only 1 patient required dilation of a midconduit stricture. One patient required late reoperation for conduit redundancy.

"Evaluating the risk of cervical precancer with a combination of cytologic, virologic, and visual methods.","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev.,2005-11-01,"Several test modalities (cytologic, molecular, and visual) may be used for cervical cancer screening, triage, and follow-up. Although no currently available single test for cervical neoplasia can detect disease with both high sensitivity and specificity, combinations of available tests allow for improved risk prediction. We therefore evaluated the combination of liquid-based cytology (LBC), human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing, and visual inspection (cervicography), taken at a single point in time, to predict risk of subsequent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN3) or cancer developing within 2 years in a triage population of 5,060 women referred for equivocal or mildly abnormal cytology. The concurrent administration of all three test modalities showed that combinations of these test modalities permitted clear and distinct risk stratification. Among HPV-positive women with high-grade LBC and high-grade cervicography results, 79.1 % [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 64.0- 90.0] were diagnosed with histologic CIN3 or cancer within 2 years, supporting a ""see-and-treat"" clinical application. Conversely, only 1.4% (95% CI, 0.7-2.5) of women with a negative HPV, normal cervigram, and second normal cytology result developed CIN3 or cancer. Because this low absolute risk was largely attributable to the negative HPV test, our results suggest a lack of benefit for a secondary or tertiary test result given an HPV-negative test result. Within HPV-positive women, however, we observed a steadily increasing absolute risk for cervical precancer/cancer with increasing numbers and severity of abnormal test results. We conclude that the clear discrimination of cervical cancer risk provided by multiple test modalities is consistent with our understanding of cervical etiology related to HPV natural history.",Journal Article,5194.0,21.0,"Several test modalities cytologic molecular and visual may be used for cancer screening triage and follow-up Although no currently available single test for neoplasia can detect disease with both high sensitivity and specificity combinations of available tests allow for improved risk prediction We therefore evaluated the combination of liquid-based cytology LBC human papillomavirus HPV DNA testing and visual inspection cervicography taken at a single point in time to predict risk of subsequent intraepithelial neoplasia 3 CIN3 or cancer developing within 2 years in a triage population of 5,060 women referred for equivocal or mildly abnormal cytology The concurrent administration of all three test modalities showed that combinations of these test modalities permitted clear and distinct risk stratification Among HPV-positive women with high-grade LBC and high-grade cervicography results 79.1 95 confidence interval 95 CI 64.0- 90.0 were diagnosed with histologic CIN3 or cancer within 2 years supporting a `` see-and-treat '' clinical application Conversely only 1.4 95 CI 0.7-2.5 of women with a negative HPV normal cervigram and second normal cytology result developed CIN3 or cancer Because this low absolute risk was largely attributable to the negative HPV test our results suggest a lack of benefit for a secondary or tertiary test result given an HPV-negative test result Within HPV-positive women however we observed a steadily increasing absolute risk for precancer/cancer with increasing numbers and severity of abnormal test results We conclude that the clear discrimination of cancer risk provided by multiple test modalities is consistent with our understanding of etiology related to HPV natural history",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[392, 412, 1558, 4195, 219, 2, 3046, 68, 40, 95, 9, 12, 453, 9059, 2, 166, 126, 242, 77, 694, 390, 226, 412, 9, 2298, 122, 1426, 34, 5, 110, 64, 485, 2, 1121, 1247, 1, 390, 895, 1700, 9, 231, 43, 1590, 21, 673, 194, 3, 150, 1, 3165, 90, 2045, 28439, 171, 3242, 933, 261, 471, 2, 3046, 11746, 44156, 1633, 28, 8, 226, 741, 4, 98, 6, 678, 43, 1, 706, 4153, 2298, 27, 10346, 15, 12, 931, 262, 18, 60, 4, 8, 9059, 266, 1, 33, 9972, 117, 1995, 9, 5068, 15, 9443, 1668, 2045, 3, 750, 634, 1, 62, 169, 412, 1558, 224, 17, 1247, 1, 46, 412, 1558, 5449, 885, 2, 834, 43, 1541, 107, 933, 109, 117, 5, 64, 88, 28439, 2, 64, 88, 44156, 99, 842, 14, 48, 307, 268, 48, 58, 660, 13, 424, 13, 11, 265, 5, 884, 10346, 15, 12, 262, 18, 60, 1912, 8, 3764, 2, 943, 522, 38, 1581, 3154, 158, 14, 39, 48, 58, 13, 67, 18, 33, 1, 117, 5, 8, 199, 933, 295, 55160, 2, 419, 295, 2045, 757, 276, 10346, 15, 12, 408, 26, 154, 1766, 43, 10, 1733, 2971, 6, 3, 199, 933, 412, 114, 99, 309, 8, 926, 1, 247, 9, 8, 568, 15, 2557, 412, 757, 447, 35, 933, 199, 412, 757, 262, 933, 109, 117, 137, 21, 164, 8, 7025, 602, 1766, 43, 9, 12380, 12, 5, 602, 1870, 2, 1702, 1, 1668, 412, 99, 21, 2060, 17, 3, 885, 3520, 1, 12, 43, 1052, 20, 232, 412, 1558, 16, 925, 5, 114, 612, 1, 2855, 139, 6, 933, 1504, 532]",1727.0,16284394,43
A case-control study of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphisms in cervical carcinogenesis.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2005-11-17,"Polymorphisms in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene are thought to be associated with a varying risk of cervical dysplasia. The purpose of this trial was to study the role of the two common functional MHTFR polymorphisms in a large multiracial population at risk for cervical dysplasia and cancer. This is a nested case-control study of 376 subjects obtained from cohorts enrolled in an ongoing prospective cervical carcinogenesis protocol. Cases included invasive cancers (n = 51), and high (n = 50) and low (n = 50) grade dysplasia. There were 225 normal controls. Functional MTHFR 677C-->T and 1298A-->C genotypes were identified. Follow-up cytology data were reviewed for the control subjects from the time of study entry until August 2004. There is a significant racial difference in allele frequency of the 677C-->T polymorphism (P < 0.005). African-American women had an extremely low prevalence of the 677T allele (8%). There was no significant difference in the frequency of the 677T allele between cases and controls. There is no racial difference in allele frequency of the 1298A-->C polymorphism. Also, no significant difference was found between cases and controls. Of the 51 cancers, no case was homozygous for both aberrant polymorphisms (677T, 1298C), and only 3 cases were heterozygous for both. Follow-up data were available for 129 of 225 control subjects (57%). Only 15 (12%) have had a subsequent abnormal pap, and there was no association with the 677C-->T polymorphism. We confirm a significant difference in the 677T allele frequencies among racial groups. However, there is no association of either the 677C-->T or 1298A-->C polymorphisms in cervical carcinogenesis.

Peritumoral lymphatic vessel density and vascular endothelial growth factor C expression in early-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2005-12-01,"Lymphatic invasion and nodal metastasis plays a major role in the spread of cervical cancer; however, little is known about the mechanisms whereby tumor cells enter the lymphatic system. We examined the intra- and peritumoral lymphatic vessel density (LVD) using D2-40 immunohistochemistry in 111 cervical squamous cell carcinomas and correlated them with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C expression, clinicopathologic tumor features, and outcome. Compared with benign cervix, intratumoral and peritumoral LVD was significantly increased (P < 0.0001). Peritumoral LVD was significantly higher than intratumoral LVD (P = 0.009). High peritumoral, but not intratumoral, LVD showed significant correlation with high tumor stage, lymphatic invasion, and nodal metastasis. VEGF-C showed increased expression at the invasive edge compared with the center of tumors (P < 0.0001) and correlated with high peritumoral LVD, lymphatic invasion, and nodal metastasis. High peritumoral LVD and VEGF-C expression at the invasive edge of tumors were associated with poor overall and recurrence-free survival in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, peritumoral LVD was the only independent term predictive of overall survival. Our findings suggest a potential role for VEGF-C in tumor-induced lymphangiogenesis represented by high peritumoral LVD, which may be one of the mechanisms leading to lymphatic invasion and metastatic spread.

The families of the Swedish Family-Cancer Database with at least 4 generations (N = 566,877) were classified according to the Amsterdam and the Bethesda criteria. Survival methods were used to assess the risk of cancer in the classified families, the prognosis of cancer patients, and the risk of subsequent malignancies after colorectal adenomas and after colorectal/endometrial adenocarcinomas. The Bethesda criteria identified 0.9% of all Swedish families and 11.2% of patients with colorectal cancer. Families that fulfilled the Bethesda criteria showed increased risks of cancer in the colorectum, endometrium, small bowel, ovary, stomach, bile ducts, renal pelvis, and ureter; members of Bethesda criteria families were at decreased risks of lung and cervical cancers. The prognosis of cancer in the ureter, renal pelvis, stomach, ovary, and colorectum, but not in the endometrium, was better in Bethesda criteria than in nonclassified families.

A proposal for an international retinoblastoma staging system.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2006-11-01,"Although intra-retinal tumor has long been staged presurgically according to the Reese-Ellsworth (R-E) system, retinoblastoma differs from other pediatric neoplasms in never having had a widely accepted classification system that encompasses the entire spectrum of the disease. Comparisons among studies that consider disease extension, risk factors for extra-ocular relapse, and response to therapy require a universally accepted staging system for extra-ocular disease. A committee of retinoblastoma experts from large centers worldwide has developed a consensus classification that can encompass all retinoblastoma cases and is presented herein. Patients are classified according to extent of disease and the presence of overt extra-ocular extension. In addition, a proposal for substaging considering histopathological features of enucleated specimens is presented to further discriminate between Stage I and II patients. The following is a summary of the classification system developed-Stage 0: Patients treated conservatively (subject to presurgical ophthalmologic classifications); Stage I: Eye enucleated, completely resected histologically; Stage II: Eye enucleated, microscopic residual tumor; Stage III: Regional extension [(a) overt orbital disease, (b) preauricular or cervical lymph node extension]; Stage IV: Metastatic disease [(a) hematogenous metastasis: (1) single lesion, (2) multiple lesions; (b) CNS extension: (1) prechiasmatic lesion, (2) CNS mass, (3) leptomeningeal disease].

This prospective multicenter clinical study was conducted by the American College of Radiology Imaging Network and the Gynecologic Oncology Group from March 2000 to November 2002; 25 United States health centers enrolled 208 consecutive patients with biopsy-confirmed cervical cancer of FIGO stage > or = IB who were scheduled for surgery based on clinical assessment. Patients underwent FIGO clinical staging, helical CT, and MRI. Surgicopathologic findings constituted the reference standard for statistical analysis. Complete data were available for 172 patients; surgicopathologic findings were consistent with FIGO stages IA to IIA in 76% and stage > or = IIB in 21%. For the detection of advanced stage (> or = IIB), sensitivity was poor for FIGO clinical staging (29%), CT (42%), and MRI (53%); specificity was 99% for FIGO clinical staging, 82% for CT, and 74% for MRI; and negative predictive value was 84% for FIGO clinical staging, 84% for CT, and 85% for MRI. MRI (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.88) was significantly better than CT (AUC, 0.73) for detecting cervical tumors (P = .014).

Antivascular therapy of oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma with PTK787.,The Laryngoscope,Laryngoscope,2005-12-01,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important mediator in tumor vascularization, growth, and metastasis. We investigated whether blockade of the VEGF receptor (VEGF-R) signaling pathway by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor PTK787 combined with CPT-11, a semisynthetic camptothecin analogue, can inhibit the tumor growth and angiogenesis of squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue in an orthotopic nude mouse model. JMAR human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells were injected into the tongues of nude mice. Seven days later, the mice were randomized to receive a placebo, daily oral PTK787, weekly CPT-11 injection, or PTK787 plus CPT-11. After 4 weeks of treatment, the mice underwent necropsy, and the tongue tumors, cervical lymph nodes, and lungs were removed for immunohistochemical analyses. CPT-11, PTK787, and PTK787 plus CPT-11 significantly decreased tumor volumes and prolonged survival. The combination treatment group had the most significant decrease in volume and increase in survival. PTK787 alone or in combination with CPT-11 reduced the phosphorylation of VEGF-R in tumor cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells, was associated with decreased microvessel density, a decreased proliferative index, and an increased apoptotic index. PTK787 alone or the combination therapy resulted in apoptosis of both tumor cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells.

Low podoplanin expression in pretreatment biopsy material predicts poor prognosis in advanced-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix treated by primary radiation.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2006-05-01,"Lymphatic invasion and nodal metastasis are predictors of poor outcome in cervix carcinoma. We have recently found that low podoplanin immunoreactivity in cervix carcinoma correlated with the presence of lymphatic invasion and nodal metastasis. In the current study, we examined whether podoplanin expression in pretreatment cervical biopsies can predict the presence lymphatic invasion, nodal metastasis, and outcome in advanced-stage tumors treated by nonsurgical means. Podoplanin expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 48 cervical biopsies and corresponding hysterectomy specimens of early-stage invasive squamous cell carcinoma and in 74 pretreatment biopsies from advanced-stage tumors treated with primary radiation. We found a highly significant correlation between podoplanin expression obtained in biopsy and corresponding hysterectomy materials (r = 0.8962, P < 0.0001). Low podoplanin expression showed a significant correlation with lymphatic invasion (P < 0.0001) and nodal metastasis (P = 0.0058). Low podoplanin expression in pretreatment biopsy material showed a significant correlation with poor disease-free (P = 0.0009) and overall (P = 0.0002) survival in advanced-stage tumors. Our results suggest that in advanced-stage cervix carcinomas treated by radiation, when traditional prognostic indicators are not available and treatment decisions are based on biopsy material and clinical staging parameters, examination of podoplanin expression in pretreatment biopsy material may be a useful marker to predict lymphatic metastasis and patient outcome.

Autophagic cell death of malignant glioma cells induced by a conditionally replicating adenovirus.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2006-05-01,"Conditionally replicating adenoviruses (CRAds) can be engineered to replicate selectively in cancer cells and cause cancer-specific cell lysis; thus they are considered a promising cancer therapy. To elucidate the mechanisms by which CRAds induce cancer-specific cell death, we infected normal human fibroblasts (MRC5, telomerase negative), human malignant glioma (U373-MG and U87-MG), human cervical cancer (HeLa), and human prostate cancer (PC3) cells (all telomerase positive) with CRAds regulated by the human telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter (hTERT-Ad) or control nonreplicating adenoviruses (Ad-GFP). Nonapoptotic autophagy was assessed in Ad-GFP- and hTERT-Ad-infected cells by examining cell morphology, the development of acidic vesicular organelles, and the conversion of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 from the cytoplasmic form to the autophagosome membrane form; signaling via mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), an autophagy-associated molecule, was monitored by western blot analysis. We also compared the growth of subcutaneous gliomas in nude mice that were treated by intratumoral injection with Ad-GFP or hTERT-Ad. Survival of athymic mice carrying intracranial gliomas treated by intratumoral injection with Ad-GFP or hTERT-Ad was compared by using the Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox-Mantel log-rank analysis.

Concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy as the standard of care for cervical cancer.,Nature clinical practice. Oncology,Nat Clin Pract Oncol,2006-05-01,"From 1999-2000, each of five randomized trials demonstrated improved rates of survival and local control when concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy was added to radiation therapy in patients with loco-regionally advanced cervical cancer. These studies demonstrated that addition of chemotherapy to radiation therapy improved the outcome of patients treated with radiation therapy and hysterectomy or radiation therapy alone. Although concurrent chemotherapy increases the severity of acute side effects, it does not appear to increase the risk of late side effects of radiation therapy. A sixth randomized trial, published in 2002, failed to demonstrate improved outcome with concurrent weekly cisplatin over radiation therapy alone; however, the earlier trials demonstrated benefit with this chemoradiation regimen. In addition, three of the earlier randomized trials demonstrated improved outcome with combinations of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil compared with radiation therapy alone. Although cisplatin-based chemoradiation is the most accepted standard, individual trials have suggested that other drugs, including mitomycin and epirubicin, might be beneficial. Randomized trials that investigated the administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy before radiation therapy have failed to demonstrate a benefit of this approach. Although the evidence for benefit of concurrent chemotherapy is strong for otherwise healthy patients with newly diagnosed, loco-regionally advanced cervical cancers confined to the pelvis, the relative benefits and risks are not well understood for patients who are infirm or who require larger fields of radiation therapy.

Cystoscopic temporary ureteral catheterization during radical vaginal and abdominal trachelectomy.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2006-06-06,"To describe the role of temporary retrograde ureteral catheterization at the time of fertility-sparing radical vaginal or abdominal trachelectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer. We analyzed a prospectively maintained database of all patients with cervical cancer who were explored for radical vaginal or abdominal trachelectomy at our institution. Cystourethroscopy and ureteral catheterization were performed prior to the vaginal or abdominal operation in all patients, except two pediatric ones. Temporary bilateral retrograde ureteral catheters were planned for all patients as part of our routine procedure to facilitate identification of the distal ureters. 5Fr whistle-tip or open-ended catheters were used and usually advanced to approximately 20 cm. Catheters were removed at the end of the operation in all cases. All catheters were inserted by a gynecologic oncology fellow or attending. Between 11/01 and 12/05, 40 patients were taken to the operating room for planned fertility-sparing radical vaginal or abdominal trachelectomy. We previously reported on two pediatric patients; they are excluded from this report. The median age for adult patients was 32 years (mean, 31.6; range, 23-40). International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage included IB1 (26), IA2 (6), and IA1 with lymphovascular invasion (6). Thirty-four patients underwent radical vaginal trachelectomy and four underwent a radical abdominal trachelectomy. Two (5%) of 38 patients required immediate completion radical hysterectomy due to extensive endocervical disease (one in the vaginal group and one in the abdominal group). Bilateral ureteral catheters were inserted successfully in 37 (97%) of 38 patients and facilitated identification of the distal ureter during the dissection. In one case, the right ureteral orifice could not be successfully catheterized, and the case was completed with unilateral catheterization. The estimated time to perform this part of the operation was approximately 15-20 min. Twenty-eight patients (74%) had 5Fr whistle-tip ureteral catheters inserted, and 10 had open-ended catheters inserted. There were no intraoperative complications. Median hospital stay was 3 days (range, 3-7). Hematuria, evident in the drainage bag attached to the Foley catheter, usually resolved in 24-48 h. Two (20%) of 10 patients who had open-ended catheters inserted developed a transient rise in postoperative creatinine (1.7 and 3.5 mg/dl, respectively) compared to 0/28 patients who had whistle-tip catheters placed (P<0.001).

Dosimetric predictors of acute hematologic toxicity in cervical cancer patients treated with concurrent cisplatin and intensity-modulated pelvic radiotherapy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2006-06-06,"To identify dosimetric parameters associated with acute hematologic toxicity (HT) and chemotherapy delivery in cervical cancer patients undergoing concurrent chemotherapy and intensity-modulated pelvic radiotherapy. We analyzed 37 cervical cancer patients receiving concurrent cisplatin (40 mg/m(2)/wk) and intensity-modulated pelvic radiotherapy. Pelvic bone marrow (BM) was contoured for each patient and divided into three subsites: lumbosacral spine, ilium, and lower pelvis. The volume of each region receiving 10, 20, 30, and > or =40 Gy (V(10), V(20), V(30), and V(40), respectively) was calculated. HT was graded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group system. Multivariate regression models were used to test associations between dosimetric parameters and HT and chemotherapy delivery. Increased pelvic BM V(10) (BM-V(10)) was associated with an increased Grade 2 or worse leukopenia and neutropenia (odds ratio [OR], 2.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-3.53; p = 0.006; and OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.02-1.94; p = 0.037, respectively).

Recognition of a cervical cancer derived tumor cell line by a human papillomavirus type 16 E6 52-61-specific CD8 T cell clone.,Cancer immunity,Cancer Immun.,2006-06-30,"The E6 and E7 proteins of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types are thought to be the ideal sources of antigens for immunotherapy for cervical cancer since they are expressed by the tumors and not by normal cells. We recently described new HPV 16 epitopes, including the E6 52-61 peptide restricted by HLA class I molecule B57. Primary tumor cell lines were established from three HLA-B57 positive, HPV 16 positive cervical cancer patients, and their recognition by a E6 52-61 specific CD8+ T cell clone was determined using a chromium release assay and an IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay. The recognition of homologous epitopes contained in other high-risk HPV types (18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, and 73) was also examined at the peptide level. A low level of killing of two of the tumor cell lines derived from the three patients was demonstrated using a chromium release assay. The level of killing of one of these tumor cell lines was enhanced upon treatment with IFN-gamma and/or the addition of antigen. This tumor cell line also induced measurable IFN-gamma secretion. The recognition of homologous epitopes from HPV 35, 39, 45, 51, and 73 was detected in an ELISPOT assay. Therefore, the HPV 16 E6 52-61 epitope appears to be at least weakly expressed by tumor cell lines derived from cervical cancer, and the HPV 16 E6 52-61-specific T cell clone can recognize homologous peptides derived from other high risk HPV sequences.",Journal Article,4953.0,12.0,The E6 and E7 proteins of high-risk human papillomavirus HPV types are thought to be the ideal sources of antigens for immunotherapy for cancer since they are expressed by the tumors and not by normal cells We recently described new HPV 16 epitopes including the E6 52-61 peptide restricted by HLA class I molecule B57 Primary tumor cell lines were established from three HLA-B57 positive HPV 16 positive cancer patients and their recognition by a E6 52-61 specific CD8+ T cell clone was determined using a chromium release assay and an IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot ELISPOT assay The recognition of homologous epitopes contained in other high-risk HPV types 18 31 33 35 39 45 51 52 56 58 59 68 and 73 was also examined at the peptide level A low level of killing of two of the tumor cell lines derived from the three patients was demonstrated using a chromium release assay The level of killing of one of these tumor cell lines was enhanced upon treatment with IFN-gamma and/or the addition of antigen This tumor cell line also induced measurable IFN-gamma secretion The recognition of homologous epitopes from HPV 35 39 45 51 and 73 was detected in an ELISPOT assay Therefore the HPV 16 E6 52-61 epitope appears to be at least weakly expressed by tumor cell lines derived from cancer and the HPV 16 E6 52-61-specific T cell clone can recognize homologous peptides derived from other high risk HPV sequences,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[3, 4837, 2, 4540, 652, 1, 64, 43, 171, 3242, 933, 630, 32, 2739, 6, 40, 3, 3662, 3375, 1, 1575, 9, 726, 9, 12, 1192, 491, 32, 570, 20, 3, 57, 2, 44, 20, 295, 37, 21, 761, 1027, 217, 933, 245, 4915, 141, 3, 4837, 653, 713, 1389, 2016, 20, 1160, 1040, 70, 1354, 44400, 86, 30, 31, 285, 11, 635, 29, 169, 1160, 44400, 109, 933, 245, 109, 12, 7, 2, 136, 2335, 20, 8, 4837, 653, 713, 112, 968, 102, 31, 3910, 10, 509, 75, 8, 22168, 2008, 719, 2, 35, 1256, 1705, 1644, 1199, 11244, 7662, 719, 3, 2335, 1, 3894, 4915, 3070, 4, 127, 64, 43, 933, 630, 203, 456, 466, 465, 587, 512, 725, 653, 664, 717, 728, 806, 2, 803, 10, 120, 409, 28, 3, 1389, 301, 8, 154, 301, 1, 3003, 1, 100, 1, 3, 30, 31, 285, 526, 29, 3, 169, 7, 10, 264, 75, 8, 22168, 2008, 719, 3, 301, 1, 3003, 1, 104, 1, 46, 30, 31, 285, 10, 651, 1548, 24, 5, 1256, 1705, 2, 15, 3, 352, 1, 448, 26, 30, 31, 328, 120, 277, 1884, 1256, 1705, 2935, 3, 2335, 1, 3894, 4915, 29, 933, 465, 587, 512, 725, 2, 803, 10, 530, 4, 35, 7662, 719, 673, 3, 933, 245, 4837, 653, 713, 4430, 1233, 6, 40, 28, 506, 7348, 570, 20, 30, 31, 285, 526, 29, 12, 2, 3, 933, 245, 4837, 653, 713, 112, 102, 31, 3910, 122, 4237, 3894, 2491, 526, 29, 127, 64, 43, 933, 2866]",1413.0,16808432,405
Chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of cervical cancer.,Seminars in radiation oncology,Semin Radiat Oncol,2006-07-01,"The advantage of concurrent chemoradiotherapy over radiotherapy alone in patients with cervical cancer has now been well documented in a series of prospective randomized trials. Six of these trials compared a cisplatin-based regimen (either cisplatin alone administered weekly or a combination of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil) with radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy plus another, less effective chemotherapy; 5 of these 6 trials showed a benefit with concurrent chemotherapy. Individual trials have also suggested that epirubicin and the combination of mitomycin plus 5-fluorouracil are effective when administered concurrently with radiotherapy. Other drugs, particularly biologic response modifiers, are currently being studied for their potential benefit in combination with radiation and cisplatin. Although the side effects of chemoradiotherapy with weekly cisplatin or cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil are tolerable for most patients, the addition of concurrent chemotherapy to radiotherapy markedly increases hematologic and gastrointestinal side effects and adds to the overall complexity of treatment. Successful management requires particularly close monitoring of hematologic parameters, fluid balance, electrolyte levels, dietary condition, and social support. Careful coordination between caregivers is crucial. Although early publication of some trials precluded mature analysis of late radiation effects, available data suggest that the addition of concurrent chemotherapy does not markedly increase the risk of major late complications. Most women with locoregionally advanced cervical cancers (stage IB2 or greater or positive pelvic lymph nodes) that are confined to the pelvis are candidates for chemoradiotherapy. However, the benefit of adding concurrent chemotherapy to radiotherapy should always be weighed against the risk of serious acute side effects, particularly in patients who have serious coexisting medical conditions that would have precluded or discouraged enrollment in the prospective trials.",Journal Article,4952.0,59.0,The advantage of concurrent chemoradiotherapy over radiotherapy alone in patients with cancer has now been well documented in a series of prospective randomized trials Six of these trials compared a cisplatin-based regimen either cisplatin alone administered weekly or a combination of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil with radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy plus another less effective chemotherapy 5 of these 6 trials showed a benefit with concurrent chemotherapy Individual trials have also suggested that epirubicin and the combination of mitomycin plus 5-fluorouracil are effective when administered concurrently with radiotherapy Other drugs particularly biologic response modifiers are currently being studied for their potential benefit in combination with radiation and cisplatin Although the side effects of chemoradiotherapy with weekly cisplatin or cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil are tolerable for most patients the addition of concurrent chemotherapy to radiotherapy markedly increases hematologic and side effects and adds to the overall complexity of treatment Successful management requires particularly close monitoring of hematologic parameters fluid balance electrolyte levels dietary condition and social support Careful coordination between caregivers is crucial Although early publication of some trials precluded mature analysis of late radiation effects available data suggest that the addition of concurrent chemotherapy does not markedly increase the risk of major late complications Most women with locoregionally advanced cancers stage IB2 or greater or positive pelvic lymph nodes that are confined to the pelvis are candidates for chemoradiotherapy However the benefit of adding concurrent chemotherapy to radiotherapy should always be weighed against the risk of serious acute side effects particularly in patients who have serious coexisting medical conditions that would have precluded or discouraged enrollment in the prospective trials,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[3, 1874, 1, 750, 1464, 252, 310, 279, 4, 7, 5, 12, 71, 1134, 85, 149, 1405, 4, 8, 988, 1, 482, 384, 143, 437, 1, 46, 143, 72, 8, 540, 90, 477, 361, 540, 279, 468, 709, 15, 8, 150, 1, 540, 2, 33, 1404, 5, 310, 279, 15, 310, 349, 1809, 299, 323, 56, 33, 1, 46, 49, 143, 224, 8, 247, 5, 750, 56, 797, 143, 47, 120, 1148, 17, 5363, 2, 3, 150, 1, 5837, 349, 33, 1404, 32, 323, 198, 468, 3294, 5, 310, 127, 600, 823, 1283, 51, 5663, 32, 694, 486, 656, 9, 136, 174, 247, 4, 150, 5, 121, 2, 540, 242, 3, 1152, 176, 1, 1464, 5, 709, 540, 15, 540, 349, 33, 1404, 32, 2668, 9, 96, 7, 3, 352, 1, 750, 56, 6, 310, 2195, 1106, 813, 2, 1152, 176, 2, 6659, 6, 3, 63, 3082, 1, 24, 1401, 284, 1706, 823, 2336, 1315, 1, 813, 1038, 2357, 3459, 10834, 148, 2013, 2850, 2, 2032, 538, 3465, 6373, 59, 2771, 16, 2653, 242, 191, 4397, 1, 476, 143, 8035, 2908, 65, 1, 807, 121, 176, 390, 74, 309, 17, 3, 352, 1, 750, 56, 1097, 44, 2195, 344, 3, 43, 1, 458, 807, 521, 96, 117, 5, 6410, 131, 163, 82, 9537, 15, 378, 15, 109, 1110, 263, 502, 17, 32, 2902, 6, 3, 3270, 32, 1931, 9, 1464, 137, 3, 247, 1, 2726, 750, 56, 6, 310, 257, 3763, 40, 10271, 480, 3, 43, 1, 1762, 286, 1152, 176, 823, 4, 7, 54, 47, 1762, 8859, 484, 1298, 17, 688, 47, 8035, 15, 17899, 1798, 4, 3, 482, 143]",1965.0,16814159,655

Smoking behavior was ascertained using an administered questionnaire and by quantifying urine cotinine concentration. Disease progression was defined as a >or=50% increase in the cross product of the existing tumor compared with previous assessments. Patients were followed until death. Of 328 enrolled patients, 12 were ineligible, one was inevaluable for reported smoking status and 40 others were inevaluable for cotinine-derived smoking status.

The purpose of this report is to describe our technique of radical abdominal trachelectomy, a fertility-sparing operation in women with cervical cancer, and review the current literature on this procedure. A review of a prospectively maintained database of all fertility-sparing radical trachelectomy procedures performed at our institution. Between 11/01 and 3/06, we performed a total of 42 fertility-preserving radical trachelectomies with pelvic lymphadenectomy for women with invasive cervical cancer. We had previously reported on 2 pediatric abdominal trachelectomies, which are excluded from this report. Five of the remaining 40 cases had undergone a radical abdominal trachelectomy, and 35 cases were performed laparoscopically with a radical vaginal approach. The characteristics of the 5 adult patients who underwent abdominal radical trachelectomy included stage IB1 disease in all cases, a mean age of 36 years (range, 33-39), and a mean estimated blood loss of 280 ml (range, 50-400); 1 patient with squamous cell carcinoma needed completion radical hysterectomy at the time of trachelectomy due to disease extending into the endometrium, and 1 patient needed postoperative chemoradiation due to a positive parametrial lymph node. The remaining 3 patients resumed normal menstruation postoperatively. All patients remain disease-free at the time of this report. The only remaining uterine blood supply in these patients are the utero-ovarian vessels. There were no postoperative complications, and transurethral Foley catheters were removed in all cases within 2 weeks. Radical abdominal trachelectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy is a feasible operation for selected women with stage I cervical cancer who desire to preserve reproductive function.

Will widespread human papillomavirus prophylactic vaccination change sexual practices of adolescent and young adult women in America?,Obstetrics and gynecology,Obstet Gynecol,2006-08-01,"Two virus-like particle human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have been shown to be nearly 100% effective in preventing type-specific persistent HPV infections and associated type-specific high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Recently, it has been hypothesized that the administration of this vaccine to young girls in the United States might increase sexual promiscuity among adolescent women and/or young adults.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2006-09-07,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Recent reports have associated a subset of HNSCC with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs), particularly HPV16, the same subset of HPVs responsible for the majority of cervical and anogenital cancers. In this study we describe a mouse model for HPV-associated HNSCC that employs mice transgenic for the HPV16 oncogenes E6 and E7. In these mice, E6 and E7 induce aberrant epithelial proliferation and, in the presence of a chemical carcinogen, they increase dramatically the animal's susceptibility to HNSCC. The cancers arising in the HPV16-transgenic mice mirror the molecular and histopathological characteristics of human HPV-positive HNSCC that distinguish the latter from human HPV-negative HNSCC, including overexpression of p16 protein and formation of more basaloid cancers. This validated model of HPV-associated HNSCC provides the means to define the contributions of individual HPV oncogenes to HNSCC and to understand the molecular basis for the differing clinical properties of HPV-positive and HPV-negative human HNSCC.

Three months following the diagnosis of KS affecting a left cervical lymph node and Castleman's disease with bone marrow involvement, he presented with a subcutaneous, tender lesion on his left arm. A skin biopsy demonstrated a superficial and deep, interstitial-nodular infiltrate of severely atypical lymphoid cells showing plasmacytoid features, numerous mitotic figures, and frequent individual apoptotic tumor cells. The morphologic features were those of plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL). Immunohistochemical study showed that the lymphoma cells strongly expressed CD45, CD30, and KSHV/HHV8 latency-associated nuclear antigen. KSHV/HHV8 was also detected in the biopsy sections of the patient's KS and Castleman's disease. Epstein-Barr virus in situ hybridization was diffusely positive. In situ hybridization demonstrated kappa-light chain restriction.

A retrospective study was performed on 7 patients who were definitively treated with IMRT and concurrent chemotherapy. Patients who did not receive IMRT radiation and concurrent chemotherapy were not included in this analysis. IMRT plans were evaluated to assess the tumor coverage and normal tissue avoidance. Treatment response was evaluated and toxicities were assessed. Five- to nine-beam IMRT were used to deliver a total dose of 59.4-66 Gy (median: 64.8 Gy) to the primary tumor with 6-MV photons. The minimum dose received by the planning tumor volume (PTV) of the gross tumor volume boost was 91.2%-98.2% of the prescription dose (standard deviation [SD]: 3.7%-5.7%). The minimum dose received by the PTV of the clinical tumor volume was 93.8%-104.8% (SD: 4.3%-11.1%) of the prescribed dose. With a median follow-up of 15 mo (range: 3-21 mo), all 6 evaluable patients achieved complete response. Of them, 2 developed local recurrences and 2 had distant metastases, 3 survived with no evidence of disease.

Intraoperative localization of lymph node metastases with a replication-competent herpes simplex virus.,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg.,2006-11-01,"Lymph node status is the most important prognostic factor determining recurrence and survival in patients with mesothelioma and other thoracic malignancies. Accurate localization of lymph node metastases is therefore necessary to improve selection of resectable and curable patients for surgical intervention. This study investigates the potential to identify lymph node metastases intraoperatively by using herpes-guided cancer cell-specific expression of green fluorescent protein. After infection with NV1066, a herpes simplex virus carrying green fluorescent protein transgene, human mesothelioma cancer cell lines were assessed for cancer cell-specific infection, green fluorescent protein expression, viral replication, and cytotoxicity. Murine models of lymphatic metastasis were established by means of surgical implantation of cancer cells into the preauricular (drainage to cervical lymph nodes) and pleural (mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes) spaces of athymic mice. Fluorescent thoracoscopy, laparoscopy, and stereomicroscopy were used to localize lymph node metastases that were confirmed by means of immunohistochemistry. In vitro NV1066 infected, replicated (5- to 17,000-fold), and expressed green fluorescent protein in all cancer cells, even when infected at a low ratio of one viral plaque-forming unit per 100 tumor cells. In vivo NV1066 injected into primary tumors was able to locate and infect lymph node metastases producing green fluorescent protein that was visualized by means of fluorescent imaging. Histology confirmed lymphatic metastases, and immunohistochemistry confirmed viral presence in regions that expressed green fluorescent protein. Herpes virus-guided cancer cell-specific production of green fluorescent protein can facilitate accurate localization of lymph node metastases.

Primary lymphomas of the cervix and uterus: the University of Pennsylvania's experience and a review of the literature.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2006-09-01,"Primary lymphomas of the cervix and uterus are rare with approximately 150 cases reported in the world literature to date. Appropriate diagnosis is often delayed until the post-operative setting as clinical and radiographic presentations are non-specific. Several sub-types of lymphoma arising primarily in the cervix or uterus have been reported with diffuse large B-Cell lymphoma (DLBCL) being the most frequent. Due to the low incidence of this disease, no randomized clinical trials exist to help guide treatment. This study reports the experience of four patients with primary lymphomas of the uterus and cervix that reflect the heterogeneity of cases reported in the literature to date. The patients had a mean age at diagnosis of 46 (range 35 - 56) and presented with abnormal uterine bleeding. One patient was diagnosed by total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH), two patients were diagnosed by cervical biopsy and one patient was diagnosed by endometrial biopsy. Three patients had DLBCL and one patient had marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). All patients had stage IIE disease. Of the patients with DLBCL, one received chemotherapy followed by TAH and two received TAH followed by chemotherapy. Two of these three patients remain disease-free post-initial therapy with the third now disease-free post-salvage therapy and autologous stem cell transplant.

Eligible patients on this RTOG Phase I-II study for advanced cervix cancer included FIGO Stage IIB-IVA or patients with FIGO Stage IB through IIA with biopsy proven pelvic node metastases or tumor size > or =5 cm. Patients were treated with pelvic radiotherapy and brachytherapy. Celecoxib was prescribed at 400 mg twice daily beginning on day 1 for 1 year. Cisplatin (75 mg/m2) and 5-FU (1g/m2 for 4 days) were administered every 3 weeks times 3. The primary end point of the study was treatment related toxicity. Between August 2001 and March 2004, 84 patients were accrued to the study and 77 patients were evaluable for toxicity. Regarding the primary end point, toxicities were observed in the following areas: blood/bone marrow (16), gastrointestinal (14), pain (7), renal/genitourinary (6), cardiovascular (3), hemorrhage (1), and neurologic (1). For the first 75 evaluable patients, a toxicity failure was identified in 36 patients for a rate of 48%. Celecoxib at 400 mg twice daily together with concurrent cisplatin and 5-FU and pelvic radiotherapy has a high incidence of acute toxicities. The most frequent toxicities were hematologic.

Survival and toxicity differences between 5-day and weekly cisplatin in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2007-01-01,"Cisplatin (CDDP) administration concomitant with radiotherapy (RT) for the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer has evolved from an inpatient 5-day every 21-day regimen to a weekly outpatient regimen. This study was designed to test for differences in progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicity between the 2 regimens. In all, 77 consecutive patients at a single institution with stage IB2-IV cervical cancer were included in this analysis (using the International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians staging system). All patients were treated with CDDP, external beam RT, and 2 9-Gy high-dose-rate brachytherapy treatments. Two cohorts were compared: 1) 5-day, patients treated from 1995 to 2001 with CDDP 20 mg/m(2) x 5 days every 21 days concomitant with RT; 2) weekly, treated after May 2001 with CDDP 40 mg/m(2) weekly concomitant with RT. In all, 50 patients were treated with the 5-day regimen and 27 patients with the weekly regimen. There were no significant demographic differences between the groups. Overall 3-year PFS, controlling for stage, was 90% and 76% for 5-day and weekly groups, respectively (P = .01). Adjusting for stage, age, and completion of treatment, the risk of treatment failure among the weekly group was 3.46 times higher than the 5-day group (P = .02). The weekly group had a 3.43 times higher risk of developing acute toxicities than the 5-day group (P = .02) in advanced-stage patients. Patients who received weekly CDDP have a shorter 3-year PFS.

"Clinical cancer advances 2006: major research advances in cancer treatment, prevention, and screening--a report from the American Society of Clinical Oncology.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2006-12-08,"A MESSAGE FROM ASCO's PRESIDENT For the second consecutive year, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) is publishing Clinical Cancer Advances: Major Research Advances in Cancer Treatment, Prevention, and Screening, an annual review of the most significant cancer research presented or published over the past year. ASCO developed this report to demonstrate the enormous progress being made on the front lines of cancer research today. The report is intended to give all those with an interest in cancer care-the general public, cancer patients and physicians, policymakers, oncologists, and other medical professionals-an accessible summary of the year's most important cancer research advances. These pages report on new targeted therapies that are improving survival and response rates in hard-to-treat cancers such as kidney cancer, HER-2-positive breast cancer, head and neck cancer, and chronic myelogenous leukemia; the FDA's approval of the world's first preventive vaccine for human papillomavirus (HPV), which has the potential to dramatically reduce the global burden of cervical cancer; and advances in the fast-growing field of personalized medicine, including a new lung cancer test that could help physicians better target treatments and predict prognosis. These advances are only part of the landscape. Survival rates are on the rise, the number of cancer deaths in the United States began declining for the first time since 1930, and new research is showing that the rates of certain common cancers, such as those of the breast and colon, have stabilized, and may have even begun to decline. However, cancer research still faces a number of major obstacles. At a time of extraordinary scientific potential, declining federal funding of cancer research threatens to stall or even reverse recent progress. Such funding cuts have already led to fewer clinical trials, fewer talented young physicians entering the field, and a growing bottleneck of basic science discoveries waiting to be ""translated"" into useful therapies and diagnostics.

Reproductive concerns of women treated with radical trachelectomy for cervical cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2006-12-22,"To report the reproductive concerns of women treated for stage I cervical cancer with fertility-preserving surgery. Newly diagnosed cervical cancer patients undergoing radical trachelectomy were enrolled in this study preoperatively and assessed over time. Preliminary data from the preoperative analysis and 3-month and 6-month assessment points addressing reproductive concerns are presented. Between February 2004 and June 2006, 29 patients were enrolled in the study. Three patients were excluded because they did not undergo the planned surgery and 6 patients were excluded because they required adjuvant therapy. Future childbearing was the main reason most women chose to undergo the procedure; however, treatment choice was also guided by conversations with their doctors (41%, n=12). Twenty-six (90%) initially expressed concern over future conception and childbearing, but this increased to all patients by 6 months. At enrollment, the majority of the patients had high expectations for future conception and childbearing but this declined over time. Despite this, patients' distress gradually decreased over time. Our results show that many women who have undergone a radical trachelectomy present with distress and reproductive concerns that persist for up to 6 months postoperatively. Concerns about conception appear to decrease following surgery; however, concerns about pregnancy appear to increase post trachelectomy itself.

Oncol.,2007-02-02,"To explore clinical/pathologic factors associated with prognosis of patients with locally advanced cervical carcinoma treated with weekly cisplatin and pelvic radiation. We retrospectively reviewed data from 335 women who received weekly cisplatin and radiation while participating in similar arms of two GOG studies (protocols 120 and 165). Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated for associations between clinical/pathologic factors and prognosis. Prognosis and selected toxicities were also compared between studies. Four-year PFS and OS for stage II patients were 64.2% and 68.1%, respectively for those treated on GOG 120 and 65.8% and 73.9% for those treated on GOG 165, compared to 51.4% and 55.4% for stage III/IV patients respectively treated on GOG 120 and 37.7% and 42.7% respectively for those treated on GOG 165. In multivariate analysis, stage, tumor grade, race and age were independently predictive of PFS and OS (for all, p<0.05). Prolonged (delayed for any cause) radiation was associated with poorer PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-3.38; p=0.012) and OS (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.08-3.26; p=0.024) in GOG 165 but not GOG 120.

Human papillomavirus vaccine: a new chance to prevent cervical cancer.,Recent results in cancer research. Fortschritte der Krebsforschung. Progres dans les recherches sur le cancer,Recent Results Cancer Res.,2007-01-01,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a significant source of morbidity and mortality throughout the world and is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States. HPV is the primary etiologic agent of cervical cancer and dysplasia. Thus, cervical cancer and other HPV-associated malignancies might be prevented or treated by HPV vaccines. Recent research on the safety and efficacy of candidate prophylactic vaccines against HPV have shown very promising results, with nearly 100% efficacy in preventing the development of persistent infections and cervical dysplasia. Questions remain, however, concerning the duration of protection, vaccine acceptability, and feasibility of vaccine delivery in the developing world.

Cisplatin and paclitaxel (PT) requires a prolonged infusion and is less convenient and more toxic than the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel (CT) leading to more widespread use of CT. The objective of this study was to compare response rate and survival in patients with cervical cancer treated with PT or CT. A retrospective search of databases at the University of Oklahoma, Washington University-Barnes Jewish Christian Hospitals, Johns Hopkins University, and University of Alabama at Birmingham identified patients with stage IVB, recurrent or persistent cervical cancer who were treated with PT or CT. A total of 62 patients were identified. 14 were treated with PT and 48 with CT. There were no statistical differences between the groups in terms of demographics, prior radiation therapy, or median number of cycles. There was a trend toward a larger number of patients in the CT arm having received prior cisplatin/radiation (p=0.07). Objective responses occurred in 29% of patients receiving PT vs. 53% of patients receiving CT. With a median follow-up of 9 months, survival was not different with a median survival of 14 and 11 months, respectively.

Weekly low-dose paclitaxel and carboplatin in the treatment of advanced or recurrent cervical and endometrial cancer.,International journal of clinical oncology,Int. J. Clin. Oncol.,2007-02-25,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the toxicity profile of weekly low-dose paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with gynecologic malignancies. Patients had measurable disease defined by clinical examination or radiographic studies. Each cycle of treatment consisted of carboplatin at an AUC of 2 and paclitaxel at 80 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Twenty-eight patients with advanced or recurrent cervical and endometrial cancers were included in this study. The overall response rate (ORR) was 39% (2 CR, 9 PR). Among the 15 cervical cancers the ORR was 20%, while the 13 endometrial cancers had a 62% ORR. Median time to progression and overall survival was 3.4 and 7.6 months for those with cervical cancer and 5.5 and 15.4 months for those with endometrial cancer.

Esophageal cancer located at the neck and upper thorax treated with concurrent chemoradiation: a single-institution experience.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2006-03-01,"To characterize the treatment and outcome of patients with cervical and upper thoracic esophageal cancer, the authors retrospectively reviewed the 11-year experience from The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Thirty-five patients with M0 cervical or upper thoracic esophageal cancer and treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy were analyzed. Median radiation dose was 50.4 Gy (range, 24.5-64.8) Gy delivered with 1.8-Gy daily fractions over 5.5 weeks. Chemotherapy was 5-fluorouracil based. Response after treatment was evaluated on the basis of radiography, biopsy, or both. The survival rates were calculated by means of the Kaplan-Meier method. The median follow-up for the surviving patients was 39 months. The actuarial 5-year overall survival (OS), cause-specific survival, disease-free survival, local relapse-free survival, and distant metastasis-free survival rates were 18.6%, 27.6%, 22.4%, 47.7%, and 57.0%, respectively. Patients who received a radiation dose of greater than or equal to 50 Gy had a higher complete response rate than those who received less than 50 Gy (79.2% versus 27.3%; p = 0.003). On multivariate analysis, radiation dose was the only protective factor associated with the rates of OS (p = 0.006), cause-specific survival (p = 0.003), and local relapse-free survival (p = 0.001); tumor stage was the only factor associated with rate of disease-free survival (p = 0.007).

Propensity-matched analysis of three techniques for intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2007-05-01,"A cervical side-to-side stapled esophagogastric anastomosis appears to decrease morbidity compared with traditional hand-sewn techniques. We evaluated our experience with this novel technique in intrathoracic anastomoses and compared the outcome with circular-stapled or hand-sewn techniques. All patients undergoing transthoracic esophagectomy from 1999 to 2005 for esophageal cancer with gastric replacement were reviewed. A prospective quality improvement database, telephone interview, and chart review were used to collect data. A side-to-side stapled anastomosis was done in 44 patients, circular-stapled anastomosis in 147, and hand-sewn anastomosis in 23. Propensity scores were generated from 14 variables, which were then used to generate 23 patient triplets. End points included leak, dysphagia, stricture, other major complications, and overall survival. Follow-up was available on all patients. For matched triplet comparison, no significant difference was noted in anastomotic leaks (8.7% with side-to-side stapled, 4.3% with circular-stapled, and 4.3% with hand-sewn; p = 0.78). Postoperative dysphagia was significantly higher in hand-sewn anastomoses at 56.5% versus 26.1% with side-to-side stapled and 21.7% with circular-stapled (p = 0.04). Stricture requiring esophageal dilation was also increased in hand-sewn at 34.8% versus 8.7% with side-to-side stapled and 8.7% with circular-stapled (p = 0.04).

Oncol.,2007-05-02,"To determine the accuracy of (18)FDG PET in identifying sites of metastatic disease prior to pelvic exenteration or radical resection in patients (pts) with recurrent cervical or vaginal cancers. Pts with recurrent cervical or vaginal cancer being evaluated for surgical resection were enrolled in a prospective study approved by the institutional human subjects review board. All patients underwent (18)FDG PET scans as well as CT and/or MRI scans and were required to have pathologic confirmation of any sites suggestive of tumor recurrence. Between 1998 and 2002 a total of 27 pts were enrolled on the study. Seven patients did not complete all study requirements and are excluded from further analysis. All pts had undergone prior pelvic radiation therapy and five patients had also received chemotherapy. CT/MRI scans identified three patients with possible metastatic disease in the following sites: (1) iliac nodes (2 pts) and (2) lungs (1 pt). After surgical and pathological evaluation, only one of these sites, the lungs, was confirmed to have metastatic disease. PET scans identified possible metastatic disease in nine patients and included the following sites: (1) pelvic nodes (4 pts), (2) para-aortic nodes (2 pts), (3) axillary node (1 pt), (4) bowel wall (1 pt) and (5) lungs (1 pt). After surgical and pathologic evaluation metastatic disease was identified in five of these pts at the following sites: iliac nodes, 2; para-aortic nodes, 1; bowel wall, 1; and lungs, 1. Of the sites identified by PET scan as areas of metastasis CT scan only identified the pulmonary metastasis.

Patients were treated with concurrent 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin chemotherapy and pelvic radiotherapy and brachytherapy. Celecoxib was prescribed at a dose of 400 mg twice daily for 1 year beginning on the first day of radiotherapy. The overall and disease-free survival rates were determined. A total of 84 patients were accrued, of whom 78 were eligible. The estimated 2-year disease-free survival and overall survival rate was 69% and 83%, respectively. Of the 78 patients, 24 had treatment failure: 3 with persistent local disease, 9 local only, 2 regional, 4 distant, 1 regional and distant, 1 local and distant, and 2 with local, regional, and distant disease, and 1 had died of cervical cancer without a reported site of first failure and 1 without evidence of disease. At 2 years, the estimated disease-free survival and overall survival rate for patients with advanced cervical cancer who underwent a combination of chemoradiotherapy and celecoxib treatment was 69% and 83%, respectively. Recurrent disease developed in 24 patients, and, of those patients, 18 had a component of locoregional failure as a site of first failure.

Long-term survivors using intraoperative radiotherapy for recurrent gynecologic malignancies.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2007-06-08,"To analyze the outcomes of therapy and identify prognostic factors for patients treated with surgery followed by intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) for gynecologic malignancies at a single institution. We performed a retrospective review of 36 consecutive patients treated with IORT to 44 sites with mean follow-up of 50 months. The primary site was the cervix in 47%, endometrium in 31%, vulva in 14%, vagina in 6%, and fallopian tubes in 3%. Previous RT had failed in 72% of patients, and 89% had recurrent disease. Of 38 IORT sessions, 84% included maximal cytoreductive surgery, including 18% exenterations. The mean age was 52 years (range, 30-74), mean tumor size was 5 cm (range, 0.5-12), previous disease-free interval was 32 months (range, 0-177), and mean IORT dose was 1,152 cGy (range, 600-1,750). RT and systemic therapy after IORT were given to 53% and 24% of the cohort, respectively. The outcomes measured were locoregional control (LRC), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and treatment-related complications. The Kaplan-Meier 5-year LRC, DMFS, and DSS probability for the whole group was 44%, 51%, and 47%, respectively. For cervical cancer patients, the Kaplan-Meier 5-year LRC, DMFS, and DSS estimate was 45%, 60%, and 46%, respectively. The prognostic factors found on multivariate analysis (p <or= 0.05) were the disease-free interval for LRC, tumor size for DMFS, and cervical primary, previous surgery, and locoregional relapse for DSS.

Data were abstracted from the clinical records of women diagnosed with Stage IVA cervical cancer at the time of examination under anesthesia, cystoscopy, and proctoscopy (EUA/C/P) at a single institution from 1994 to 2004. Demographic and treatment characteristics were compared using either Fisher's exact test or Student's t-test, as appropriate. Survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Twenty-three patients were diagnosed with Stage IVA cervical cancer. All were diagnosed with extension of disease into the bladder; one patient had rectal involvement as well. Concurrent chemotherapy and radiation was used in 60.8%, while 30.4% received radiation alone and 8.7% elected no treatment. Fifty-six percent of the patients were smokers. Eleven patients (47.8%) developed a fistula at a median time of 2.9 months from cancer diagnosis. Fistula formation was significantly increased among smokers as compared to non-smokers (73 vs 27%; p=0.03). Two patients (8.7%) are alive without evidence of disease at a median follow-up of 19 months. The disease-specific survival is 23.1 months.

Human papillomavirus 16 E5 oncogene contributes to two stages of skin carcinogenesis.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2007-07-01,"High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs), which cause the vast majority of cervical cancer, other anogenital cancers, and a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, encode three oncogenes: E5, E6, and E7. To determine the oncogenic properties of HPV16 E5 in vivo, we previously generated K14E5 transgenic mice, in which expression of E5 was directed to the basal compartment of stratified squamous epithelia. In these mice, E5 induced epidermal hyperplasia and spontaneous skin tumors. In the current study, we determined how E5 contributes to tumor formation in the skin using a multistage model for skin carcinogenesis that specifies the role of genes in three stages: initiation, promotion, and malignant progression. Both initiation and promotion are required steps for papilloma formation. K14E5 mice treated with the initiating agent 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) developed more papillomas than like-treated nontransgenic mice, whereas neither K14E5 nor nontransgenic mice treated with the promoting agent 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) developed papillomas. K14E5 mice treated with both DMBA and TPA to induce large numbers of papillomas had a higher incidence and earlier onset of carcinoma progression compared with like-treated nontransgenic mice. Thus, HPV16 E5 contributes to two stages of skin carcinogenesis: promotion and progression.

Multimodality therapy for locally advanced cervical carcinoma: state of the art and future directions.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2007-07-01,"Globally, cervical cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality among women causing approximately 234,000 deaths annually among developing countries and killing 40,000 in developed nations. Most of these deaths occur in women with bulky or locally advanced cervical cancer, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages IIB through IVA, when lesions are not amenable to high cure rates with surgery or radiation (RT). The standard prescription for RT used to treat locally advanced cervical cancer has been dictated by common practice and patterns of care studies. In contrast, the addition of concomitant chemotherapy to RT has been studied in a number of randomized prospective trials, which are discussed in detail. When added to RT, cisplatin reduces the relative risk of death from cervical carcinoma by approximately 50% by decreasing local/pelvic failure and distant metastases. In 1999, weekly intravenous cisplatin at 40 mg/m2 for 6 weeks in combination with RT was established as a new standard for the treatment of locally advanced cervical carcinoma. More recently, this recommendation has been expanded to include women with FIGO stage IB2 lesions as well as those with bulky stage IIA cancers.

Development of a macromolecular dual-modality MR-optical imaging for sentinel lymph node mapping.,Investigative radiology,Invest Radiol,2007-08-01,"To evaluate the effectiveness of a dual magnetic resonance-near infrared fluorescence optical imaging agent, poly(l-glutamic acid)-DTPA-Gd-NIR813, for both preoperative and intraoperative visualization and characterization of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in mice. Poly(L-glutamic acid) was conjugated with DTPA-Gd and NIR813 dye to obtain PG-DTPA-Gd-NIR813. To confirm drainage into the SLNs, this agent was injected subcutaneously into the front paw of nude mice followed by isosulfan blue (n = 6). Furthermore, PG-DTPA-Gd-NIR813 was injected subcutaneously at doses of 0.002 mmol Gd/kg (4.8 nmol eq. NIR813) and 0.02 mmol Gd/kg (48 nmol eq. NIR813) (n = 3/dose). To differentiate metastatic from nonmetastatic lymph nodes, nude mice bearing human oral squamous cell carcinoma (DM14) were injected intralingually with 0.02 mmol Gd/kg PG-DTPA-Gd-NIR813 (n = 3). Pre- and postcontrast images were taken using 4.7 T Bruker MRI scanner and Xenogen optical imaging system. The status of lymph nodes resected under the guidance of optical imaging was confirmed by histologic examinations. PG-DTPA-Gd-NIR813 colocalized with isosulfan blue, indicating drainage to the SLN. After subcutaneous injection, axiliary and branchial lymph nodes were clearly visualized with both T1-weighted MR and optical imaging within 3 minutes of contrast injection, even at the lowest dose tested (0.002 mmol Gd/kg). After intralingual injection in tumor-bearing mice, MR imaging identified 4 of the 6 superficial cervical lymph nodes, whereas near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) optical imaging identified all 6 cervical nodes. The pattern of contrast enhancement of SLN visualized in MR images showed a characteristic ring-shaped appearance with a central filling defect, possibly resulting from nodal infiltration of metastatic lesions. Histopathologic examination of the SLNs resected under NIRF imaging guidance revealed micrometastases in all 6 SLNs identified by NIRF imaging.

Followup of patients with papillary thyroid cancer: in search of the optimal algorithm.,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,J. Am. Coll. Surg.,2007-06-18,"Cervical recurrence occurs in up to 30% of patients after surgical treatment for papillary thyroid cancer. This study sought to determine an appropriate algorithm for followup evaluation. Patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer were identified. Clinicopathologic data were recorded, as were the results of all followup evaluations including radioiodine scan, cervical ultrasonography, and serum thyroglobulin levels. The disease recurrence-free survival probability was estimated, and risk factors for recurrence were determined. Thyroidectomy with or without neck dissection was performed in 162 patients. We excluded 36 patients (followup less than 6 months in 26, extracervical disease at diagnosis in 4, unknown tumor size in 6) from the analysis. Of the remaining 126 patients, 109 (86.5%) had no evidence of disease, with serum thyroglobulin < 1 ng/mL at last followup; 4 (3.2%) had no evidence of disease (negative imaging), with serum thyroglobulin > 1 ng/mL, and 13 (10.3%) had recurrent disease. Cervical recurrence occurred in nine patients, all detected by routine ultrasonography. Pulmonary metastases occurred in four patients; three were diagnosed by chest CT and one by radioiodine scan. Thyroid stimulating hormone-suppressed thyroglobulin levels were available in 11 of the 13 patients and were elevated in 9.

Clinical proton radiation therapy research at the Francis H. Burr Proton Therapy Center.,Technology in cancer research & treatment,Technol. Cancer Res. Treat.,2007-08-01,"The Francis H. Burr Proton Therapy Center has a 230 MeV cyclotron from which proton beams are directed to two isocentric gantries, a stereotactic intracranial beam line, and an eye line. Because of improved physical dose distribution, proton radiotherapy allows dose escalation to improve local tumor control in anatomic sites and histologies where local control is suboptimal with photons. The improved dose localization also reduces normal-tissue doses with an anticipated reduction in acute and late toxicity. Clinical treatment protocols, developed to exploit the dosimetric advantages of protons over photons, have been grouped into two broad categories. In the first, dose is escalated for anatomic sites where local control with conventional radiation doses has been suboptimal. In the second, normal-tissue sparing with protons is designed to minimize acute and late toxicity. Treatment of patients on clinical research protocols has been encouraged. Patient treatments began on the first gantry in November 2001; on the eye line in April 2002; on the second gantry in May 2002; and on the stereotactic intracranial line in August 2006. The facility currently treats 60 patients per day, including up to six children daily under anesthesia. Dose-escalation studies have been completed for early stage prostate cancer (in conjunction with Loma Linda University) and sarcomas of the cervical spine/base of skull and thoracolumbosacral spine. Protocols are in progress or development for carcinoma of the nasopharynx, paranasal sinus carcinoma, non-small-cell lung carcinoma, locally advanced carcinoma of the prostate, hepatocellular carcinoma, and pancreatic cancer. Studies evaluating the use of protons for morbidity reduction include protocols for craniospinal irradiation in conjunction with systemic chemotherapy for medulloblastoma, retinoblastoma, pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma, other pediatric sarcomas, and accelerated, hypofractionated partial breast irradiation for T1N0 breast carcinomas. For pediatric patients, protons have also been accepted as an alternative to photons for children enrolled in Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocols. Treatment of patients on these studies has often required the development of new treatment techniques (i.e., matching abutting fields for craniospinal irradiation), respiratory gating, and development of appropriate clinical infrastructure support (i.e., increase in availability of pediatric anesthesia) to allow appropriate treatment. In addition, a clinical research infrastructure for protocol development and data management is required. Results to date indicate that proton radiation therapy offers several potential treatment advantages to patients that can be studied in the setting of clinical trials. Patients' willingness to enter these clinical trials seems to be quite high; accrual to selected studies has been favorable.",Journal Article,4556.0,17.0,The Francis H.

Fertility-sparing surgery in 101 women with adenocarcinoma in situ of the cervix.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2007-08-08,"Cervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) is a precursor of invasive disease that is increasing in incidence primarily among reproductive-age women of low parity. Conization is an alternative to hysterectomy that allows future pregnancy, but has an inherent risk of residual AIS. The purpose of this study was to determine the outcomes of patients treated by this fertility-sparing strategy over an extended period of surveillance. Women diagnosed with cervical AIS who underwent primary fertility-sparing surgery with either loop excision or cold knife conization between 1993 and 2001 were identified at three institutions. A retrospective medical record review was performed. Patients 40 years of age and older and those undergoing hysterectomy within 12 months of diagnosis were excluded. A total of 101 women underwent cone biopsy and expectant management. The median age was 29 years. Fifty-seven percent were nulliparous and 23% primiparous. Cold knife conization was most commonly performed (69 vs. 32 procedures) and had a higher efficacy of achieving negative margins (72% vs. 47%; P=0.036). Thirty-five women had a total of 49 pregnancies during a mean follow-up of 51 months. Thirty-five gestations were delivered at term. There were two preterm births, eight spontaneous miscarriages, three elective terminations, and one ectopic pregnancy. Thirty-six patients had a repeat cone biopsy.

Metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue.,Cancer metastasis reviews,Cancer Metastasis Rev.,2007-12-01,"Squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue (SCCOT) is one of the most prevalent tumors of the head and neck region. Despite advances in treatment, the survival of patients with SCCOT has not significantly improved over the past several decades. Most frequently, treatment failure takes the form of local and regional recurrences, but as disease control in these areas improves, SCCOT treatment failures are occurring more often as distant metastasis. The presence of cervical lymph node metastasis is the most reliable adverse prognostic factor in patients with SCCOT, and extracapsular spread (ECS) of cervical lymph nodes metastasis is a particularly reliable predictor of regional and distant recurrence and death from disease. Decisions regarding the elective and therapeutic management of cervical lymph node metastases are made mainly on clinical grounds as we cannot always predict cervical lymph node metastasis from the size and extent of invasion of the primary tumors. Therefore, the treatment of these metastases in the management of SCCOT remains controversial. The promise of basing treatment decisions on biomarkers has yet to be fully realized because of our poor understanding of the mechanisms of regional and distant metastases of SCCOT. Here we summarize the current status of investigations of SCCOT metastases and the potential of these studies to have a positive impact on the clinical management of SCCOT in the future.",Journal Article,4434.0,229.0,Squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue SCCOT is one of the most prevalent tumors of the head and region Despite advances in treatment the survival of patients with SCCOT has not significantly improved over the past several decades Most frequently treatment failure takes the form of local and regional recurrences but as disease control in these areas improves SCCOT treatment failures are occurring more often as distant metastasis The presence of lymph node metastasis is the most reliable adverse prognostic factor in patients with SCCOT and extracapsular spread ECS of lymph nodes metastasis is a particularly reliable predictor of regional and distant recurrence and death from disease Decisions regarding the elective and therapeutic management of lymph node metastases are made mainly on clinical grounds as we can not always predict lymph node metastasis from the size and extent of invasion of the primary tumors Therefore the treatment of these metastases in the management of SCCOT remains controversial The promise of basing treatment decisions on biomarkers has yet to be fully realized because of our poor understanding of the mechanisms of regional and distant metastases of SCCOT Here we summarize the current status of investigations of SCCOT metastases and the potential of these studies to have a positive impact on the clinical management of SCCOT in the future,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[691, 31, 134, 1, 3, 518, 4391, 10948, 16, 104, 1, 3, 96, 2485, 57, 1, 3, 718, 2, 1053, 550, 954, 4, 24, 3, 25, 1, 7, 5, 10948, 71, 44, 97, 231, 252, 3, 1219, 392, 1968, 96, 746, 24, 496, 8512, 3, 1297, 1, 293, 2, 951, 1593, 84, 22, 34, 182, 4, 46, 1361, 1804, 10948, 24, 3368, 32, 1821, 80, 629, 22, 626, 278, 3, 463, 1, 263, 289, 278, 16, 3, 96, 2450, 290, 177, 161, 4, 7, 5, 10948, 2, 5607, 2579, 5861, 1, 263, 502, 278, 16, 8, 823, 2450, 980, 1, 951, 2, 626, 146, 2, 273, 29, 34, 1526, 666, 3, 4700, 2, 189, 284, 1, 263, 289, 196, 32, 1229, 2615, 23, 38, 19479, 22, 21, 122, 44, 3763, 678, 263, 289, 278, 29, 3, 444, 2, 1039, 1, 578, 1, 3, 86, 57, 673, 3, 24, 1, 46, 196, 4, 3, 284, 1, 10948, 469, 2010, 3, 1783, 1, 25974, 24, 1526, 23, 582, 71, 1145, 6, 40, 1910, 8340, 408, 1, 114, 334, 612, 1, 3, 483, 1, 951, 2, 626, 196, 1, 10948, 467, 21, 2479, 3, 291, 156, 1, 2492, 1, 10948, 196, 2, 3, 174, 1, 46, 94, 6, 47, 8, 109, 345, 23, 3, 38, 284, 1, 10948, 4, 3, 508]",1385.0,17768600,235
Adenosquamous carcinoma versus adenocarcinoma in early-stage cervical cancer patients undergoing radical hysterectomy: an outcomes analysis.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2007-09-12,"To evaluate whether histology (adenocarcinoma versus adenosquamous carcinoma) is an independent prognostic indicator in patients with stage IB1 cervical cancer after radical hysterectomy. All patients with adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous carcinoma who underwent radical hysterectomy between October 1990 and December 2006 at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center were evaluated. Clinico-pathological data collected included age, disease stage, tumor grade, lymph node status, parametrial involvement, depth of invasion, evidence of lymph-vascular space invasion (LVSI), and adjuvant therapy. Patients were categorized as having ""low-risk"" or ""high-risk"" disease depending on the final pathologic findings. We identified 126 patients with stage IB1 adenosquamous (n=29) or adenocarcinoma (n=97) cervical cancer. The median follow-up was 79 months (range 1.7-184.6). The median age was 40.3 years for patients with adenocarcinoma and 35.2 years for patients with adenosquamous carcinoma (P=0.88). Grade III histology and LVSI were more common in patients with adenosquamous tumors than in patients with adenocarcinoma (85% versus 16%; P<0.01 and 56.5% versus 32.8; P=0.04). Histology was not associated with lymph node or parametrial involvement. There was no difference in recurrence rates between the two histologic groups, but the time to recurrence was shorter for patients with adenosquamous carcinoma (7.9 months versus 15 months; P=0.01). There was no difference between cell types with regards to recurrence and recurrence-free survival rates in the low- and high-risk groups. We found no evidence that histologic subtype affects outcome; however, the median time to recurrence was shorter in patients with adenosquamous carcinoma.

Comparison of treatment tolerance and outcomes in patients with cervical cancer treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in a prospective randomized trial or with standard treatment.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2007-09-14,"To compare the treatment and outcomes of cervical cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CT-RT) in a multi-institutional trial or as standard care. We reviewed the records of 302 patients treated with CT-RT for locoregionally confined, intact cervical cancer between 1990 and 2005. Of the 302 patients, 76 were treated using cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (C/F) on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group protocol 90-01 (CT-RT(90-01)); 226 underwent CT-RT as standard care with either C/F [CT-RT(SC(C/F)); n = 115] or weekly cisplatin [CT-RT(SC(WC)); n = 111). The CT-RT(90-01) patients more often had tumors >or=6 cm and were less often diabetic than were the CT-RT(SC) patients. The CT-RT(SC(WC)) patients were more likely than the CT-RT(SC(C/F)) patients to be >or=60 years old or to have Stage III-IV disease. During treatment, CT-RT(SC(C/F)) patients experienced more Grade 2-3 neutropenia and were, therefore, less likely to receive 200 mg/m(2) cisplatin than were either CT-RT(SC(WC)) or CT-RT(90-01) patients (52% vs. 77% vs. 85%, respectively; p <0.001). At 5 years, the disease-specific survival rates were greater for patients treated with C/F [CT-RT(SC(C/F)), 75%; CT-RT(90-01), 79%] than for those treated with CT-RT(SC(WC)) (58%; p = 0.02). On multivariate analysis, C/F chemotherapy, cisplatin dose >or=200 mg/m(2), Stage I-II disease, and negative pelvic lymph nodes were independent predictors of improved disease-specific survival. Even within a large comprehensive cancer center, the high rates of chemotherapy completion achieved on a multi-institutional trial can be difficult to reproduce in standard practice.

Cost-effectiveness of adding human papilloma virus testing to a managed care cervical cancer screening program.,Journal of lower genital tract disease,J Low Genit Tract Dis,2007-10-01,"The purpose of this study was to demonstrate a methodology for auditing the impact of HCII testing on the direct cost of cervical cancer cytological screening, where the test is collected in all women screened and processed routinely in women age 30 years and older. After a policy change to screen all patients 30 years or older with both Pap smears and high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV), as well as cocollection of HR-HPV in women younger than 30 years, all cytological, HPV, and histological data pertaining to cervical screening was collected retrospectively during a 2-month period. We documented the direct costs of performing these tests and estimated the necessary compliance rate for balanced cost-effectiveness. During the 2-month period, 8,300 women were screened with both Pap smear and HPV cocollection. Of the 'nonnormal' cytological findings, 5% of patients showed either atypical squamous cells (3.5%) or squamous intraepithelial abnormalities (1.5%). An additional 427 (5%) patients had the finding of positive HR-HPV with normal cytology. Six of these patients opted for immediate colposcopy, 2 of which were found to have cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2. In women age 30 years and older, 900 patients per 1,000 screened would be eligible for a 2-year screening interval based on negative cytology and negative HR-HPV.

Reducing the burden of glandular carcinomas of the uterine cervix.,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol.,2007-12-01,"Widespread use of the Papanicolaou test for the screening of cervical cancers has lead to a significant decline in overall incidence and mortality rates over the past 3 decades. When different histologic types of cervical cancers are considered and trends are reexamined, it becomes apparent that observed declines are reflective of squamous cell carcinomas predominantly; the rates for adenocarcinomas continue to rise. This rise in incidence may be due to the greater difficulty in screening for glandular precursor lesions that often arise high within the endocervical canal. Reducing the incidence and mortality rates that are associated with adenocarcinomas can be accomplished by using improved screening techniques and large-scale implementation of cervical cancer vaccines that target the predominant oncogenic human papillomavirus types that are associated with adenocarcinoma.",Journal Article,4434.0,34.0,Widespread use of the Papanicolaou test for the screening of cancers has lead to a significant decline in overall incidence and mortality rates over the past 3 decades When different histologic types of cancers are considered and trends are reexamined it becomes apparent that observed declines are reflective of squamous cell carcinomas predominantly the rates for adenocarcinomas continue to rise This rise in incidence may be due to the greater difficulty in screening for glandular precursor lesions that often arise high within the endocervical canal Reducing the incidence and mortality rates that are associated with adenocarcinomas can be accomplished by using improved screening techniques and large-scale implementation of cancer vaccines that target the predominant oncogenic human papillomavirus types that are associated with adenocarcinoma,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[3029, 119, 1, 3, 10416, 412, 9, 3, 453, 1, 163, 71, 1122, 6, 8, 93, 1858, 4, 63, 287, 2, 282, 151, 252, 3, 1219, 27, 1968, 198, 338, 884, 630, 1, 163, 32, 515, 2, 1963, 32, 20476, 192, 5366, 2235, 17, 164, 4264, 32, 11834, 1, 691, 31, 826, 2117, 3, 151, 9, 1586, 1906, 6, 3693, 26, 3693, 4, 287, 68, 40, 520, 6, 3, 378, 4035, 4, 453, 9, 6170, 2765, 406, 17, 629, 3043, 64, 262, 3, 10174, 5614, 1818, 3, 287, 2, 282, 151, 17, 32, 41, 5, 1586, 122, 40, 5741, 20, 75, 231, 453, 1092, 2, 375, 1124, 2393, 1, 12, 1842, 17, 283, 3, 2750, 1302, 171, 3242, 630, 17, 32, 41, 5, 449]",853.0,18060938,488
Cytologic findings after fertility-sparing radical trachelectomy.,Cancer,Cancer,2008-02-01,"Radical trachelectomy is a surgical procedure intended to preserve fertility in patients with early-stage cervical carcinoma in which the cervix is amputated in continuity with the parametrium and upper vagina, thereby sparing the uterus and adnexa. Follow-up is performed with periodic cytology specimens. The objective of the current study was to analyze the cytologic findings after this novel procedure. Isthmic and vaginal Papanicolaou-stained ThinPrep cytology specimens taken from patients after radical vaginal and abdominal trachelectomy were reviewed. The specimens were also analyzed for the presence of benign endocervical cells, lower uterine segment glandular cells, endometrial stromal cells, and endometrial cells. The findings were correlated with the original diagnosis and follow-up, which included subsequent cytology specimens and biopsies. Cytology specimens (n = 223) from 44 patients were included in this study. An endometrial component was identified in 131 of the cases (59%). Twenty-eight cases were diagnosed as abnormal in the original cytology examination. Twenty of these cases and 5 additional cases that were diagnosed cytologically as benign had subsequent biopsies. The biopsies confirmed the presence of a lesion in only 4 of 25 biopsies (3 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and 1 adenosquamous carcinoma). All cases diagnosed as atypical glandular cells represented tubal metaplasia, lower uterine segment glandular cells, or endometrial stromal cells.

Vertebral body growth after craniospinal irradiation.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2007-12-31,"To estimate the effects of radiotherapy and clinical factors on vertebral growth in patients with medulloblastoma and supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors treated with craniospinal irradiation (CSI) and chemotherapy. The height of eight individual or grouped vertebral bodies (C3, C3-C4, T4, T4-T5, C6-T3, T4-T7, L3, L1-L5) was measured before and after CSI (23.4 or 36-39.6 Gy) in 61 patients. Of the 61 patients, 40 were boys and 21 were girls (median age, 7 years; range, 3-13 years), treated between October 1996 and October 2003. Sagittal T(1)-weighted magnetic resonance images were used for the craniocaudal measurements. The measurements numbered 275 (median, 5/patient; range, 3-7). The median follow-up after CSI was 44.1 months (range, 13.8-74.9 months). Significant growth was observed in all measured vertebrae. Excluding C3-C4, the growth rate of the grouped vertebrae was affected by age, gender, and CSI dose (risk classification). The risk classification alone affected the growth rates of C3 (p = 0.002) and L3 (p = 0.02). Before CSI, the length of all vertebral bodies was an increasing function of age (p <0.0001). The C3 length before CSI was affected by gender and risk classification: C3 was longer for female (p = 0.07) and high-risk (p = 0.07) patients. All vertebrae grew significantly after CSI, with the vertebrae of the boys and younger patients growing at a rate greater than that of their counterparts. The effect of age was similar across all vertebrae, and gender had the greatest effect on the growth of the lower cervical and upper thoracic vertebrae.

Colorectal stents for palliation of large-bowel obstructions in recurrent gynecologic cancer: an updated series.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2008-01-10,"Malignant large-bowel obstruction in the acute setting is considered a surgical emergency. Surgical intervention has been the standard treatment for patients presenting with large-bowel obstruction. Surgery in severely ill patients, however, can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Our objective was to review and update our experience with colonic stent placement for patients presenting with a large-bowel obstruction due to recurrent gynecologic malignancy. We reviewed the records of all patients with gynecologic cancer who underwent colorectal stent placement for palliation of a large-bowel obstruction from January 2001 to October 2006. Thirty-five patients were identified--25 patients had recurrent ovarian cancer, 7 patients had recurrent endometrial cancer, 2 patients had primary peritoneal carcinoma, and 1 patient had recurrent cervical cancer. The median age at the time of stent placement was 54 years (range, 21-79). The median length of the large-bowel obstruction was 6.5 cm (range, 1-20 cm). Six patients had a lumen of 1 to 2 mm before stent placement, while 29 patients had complete obstruction and needed balloon dilatation before deployment of the stent. Twenty-seven patients (77%) underwent successful stent placement and immediate decompression at the time of colorectal stent placement. Of the patients who had successful stent placement, 9 (33%) underwent additional surgery to relieve obstruction-drainage gastrotomy, 3; colostomy, 4; and stent revision, 2. Eight patients (23%) had failed stent placement secondary to non-traversable strictures and angulation of the bowel. Of these 8 patients, 5 needed colostomy and 3 needed gastrotomy. Of the 27 patients who underwent successful stent placement, the median survival after placement was 7.7 months (95% CI, 3.19-11.9 months). In the management of patients with large-bowel obstructions due to recurrent gynecologic cancer, colonic stents appear to be a reasonable option that may enable patients to avoid major surgery.",Evaluation Study,4394.0,65.0,Malignant large-bowel obstruction in the acute setting is considered a surgical emergency Surgical intervention has been the standard treatment for patients presenting with large-bowel obstruction Surgery in severely ill patients however can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality Our objective was to review and update our experience with colonic stent placement for patients presenting with a large-bowel obstruction due to recurrent gynecologic malignancy We reviewed the records of all patients with gynecologic cancer who underwent stent placement for palliation of a large-bowel obstruction from January 2001 to October 2006 Thirty-five patients were identified -- 25 patients had recurrent cancer 7 patients had recurrent cancer 2 patients had primary peritoneal carcinoma and 1 patient had recurrent cancer The median age at the time of stent placement was 54 years range 21-79 The median length of the large-bowel obstruction was 6.5 cm range 1-20 cm Six patients had a lumen of 1 to 2 mm before stent placement while 29 patients had complete obstruction and needed balloon dilatation before deployment of the stent Twenty-seven patients 77 underwent successful stent placement and immediate decompression at the time of stent placement Of the patients who had successful stent placement 9 33 underwent additional surgery to relieve obstruction-drainage gastrotomy 3 colostomy 4 and stent revision 2 Eight patients 23 had failed stent placement secondary to non-traversable strictures and angulation of the bowel Of these 8 patients 5 needed colostomy and 3 needed gastrotomy Of the 27 patients who underwent successful stent placement the median survival after placement was 7.7 months 95 CI 3.19-11.9 months In the management of patients with large-bowel obstructions due to recurrent gynecologic cancer colonic stents appear to be a reasonable option that may enable patients to avoid major surgery,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[393, 375, 1659, 3191, 4, 3, 286, 546, 16, 515, 8, 221, 4605, 221, 788, 71, 85, 3, 260, 24, 9, 7, 1656, 5, 375, 1659, 3191, 152, 4, 7207, 4993, 7, 137, 122, 40, 41, 5, 93, 787, 2, 282, 114, 461, 10, 6, 206, 2, 2991, 114, 730, 5, 3663, 7601, 2613, 9, 7, 1656, 5, 8, 375, 1659, 3191, 520, 6, 387, 1512, 710, 21, 446, 3, 1064, 1, 62, 7, 5, 1512, 12, 54, 208, 7601, 2613, 9, 3695, 1, 8, 375, 1659, 3191, 29, 1024, 1758, 6, 2551, 1324, 977, 365, 7, 11, 108, 243, 7, 42, 387, 12, 67, 7, 42, 387, 12, 18, 7, 42, 86, 1639, 134, 2, 14, 69, 42, 387, 12, 3, 52, 89, 28, 3, 98, 1, 7601, 2613, 10, 667, 60, 184, 239, 842, 3, 52, 1318, 1, 3, 375, 1659, 3191, 10, 49, 33, 494, 184, 14, 179, 494, 437, 7, 42, 8, 10064, 1, 14, 6, 18, 321, 348, 7601, 2613, 369, 462, 7, 42, 236, 3191, 2, 575, 10725, 12799, 348, 13512, 1, 3, 7601, 737, 648, 7, 849, 208, 1401, 7601, 2613, 2, 2181, 7638, 28, 3, 98, 1, 7601, 2613, 1, 3, 7, 54, 42, 1401, 7601, 2613, 83, 466, 208, 402, 152, 6, 9635, 3191, 3528, 44994, 27, 7635, 39, 2, 7601, 5646, 18, 659, 7, 382, 42, 1551, 7601, 2613, 568, 6, 220, 56807, 7860, 2, 33234, 1, 3, 1659, 1, 46, 66, 7, 33, 575, 7635, 2, 27, 575, 44994, 1, 3, 428, 7, 54, 208, 1401, 7601, 2613, 3, 52, 25, 50, 2613, 10, 67, 67, 53, 48, 58, 27, 326, 175, 83, 53, 4, 3, 284, 1, 7, 5, 375, 1659, 17279, 520, 6, 387, 1512, 12, 3663, 9910, 1322, 6, 40, 8, 3203, 1501, 17, 68, 3047, 7, 6, 3085, 458, 152]",1926.0,18190953,83
Extraperitoneal para-aortic lymph node evaluation for cervical cancer via pfannenstiel incision: technique and peri-operative outcomes.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2008-01-14,"To examine surgico-pathologic outcomes following extraperitoneal para-aortic lymph node dissection (EPLND) via pfannenstiel compared to paramedian incision prior to radiation in patients with cervical cancer. At our institution, patients with locally advanced cervical cancer undergo, EPLND. From 1990 to 2000, EPLND was performed via paramedian incision (PM) primarily to identify positive para-aortic lymph nodes (PALN). From 2000 to present, a complete pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy was performed via pfannenstiel incision (PF). Records for all patients undergoing EPLND were reviewed. Pathologic findings, post-operative complications, and time to initiation of radiation (TRT) were abstracted. 93 patients underwent EPLND, 48 via PF and 45 via PM incision. The mean age and body mass index did not differ between the two groups. Stage distribution was similar: IB2 8 vs. 0%; IIB 44 vs. 44%; IIIA/B 35 vs. 44%; IVA 13 vs. 11%, respectively. Positive PALN were identified in 44% of PF patients and 29% of PM patients (p=ns). TRT was not significantly different at 36.4 vs. 28.8 days, respectively. There were more complications among the PF group including cellulitis and lymphocyst formation.

Racial differences in cervical cancer survival in the Detroit metropolitan area.,Cancer,Cancer,2008-03-01,"African-American (AA) women have lower survival rates from cervical cancer compared with white women. The objective of this study was to examine the influence of socioeconomic status (SES) and other variables on racial disparities in overall survival among women with invasive cervical cancer. One thousand thirty-six women (705 white women and 331 AA women) who were diagnosed with primary invasive cancer of the cervix between 1988 and 1992 were identified through the Metropolitan Detroit Cancer Surveillance System (MDCSS), a registry in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Pathology, treatment, and survival data were obtained through SEER. SES was categorized by using occupation, poverty, and educational status at the census tract level. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare overall survival between AA women and white women adjusting for sociodemographics, clinical presentation, and treatment. AA women were more likely to present at an older age (P<.001), with later stage disease (P<.001), and with squamous histology (P=.01), and they were more likely to reside in a census tract categorized as Working Poor (WP) (P<.001). After multivariate adjustment, race no longer had a significant impact on survival. Women who resided in a WP census tract had a higher risk of death than women from a Professional census tract (P=.05). There was a significant interaction between disease stage and time with the effect of stage on survival attenuated after 6 years.

Evidence-based surgical management of substernal goiter.,World journal of surgery,World J Surg,2008-07-01,"A number of reports have been published concerning the surgical treatment of substernal goiters; however, there is yet to be a comprehensive review of this body of literature using evidence-based methodology. This article is a systematic review of the literature using evidence-based criteria and a review of unpublished data from our institution. Issue 1. Limited level III/IV data suggest that the incidence of cancer in substernal goiters is not higher than the incidence of cancer in cervical goiters. Risk factors for malignancy in substernal goiters may include a family history of thyroid pathology, a history of cervical radiation therapy, recurrent goiter, and the presence of cervical adenopathy (grade C recommendation). Issue 2. Prospective level V data suggest that, for most patients, expert endocrine surgeons utilize an extracervical approach approximately 2% of the time to remove a substernal goiter safely; a sternotomy or thoracotomy appears more likely in cases of a primary substernal goiter or a mass larger than the thoracic inlet (no recommendation). Issue 3. There may be a higher rate of permanent hypoparathyroidism and unintentional permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve injury when total thyroidectomy is performed for removal of a substernal goiter than for removal of a cervical goiter alone (grade C recommendation). Injury of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve was not specifically addressed and is almost certainly underreported. Issue 4. The presence of a substernal goiter, especially being present more than 5 years and causing significant tracheal compression, is likely a risk factor for tracheomalacia and tracheostomy (grade C recommendation). Tracheomalacia with substernal goiter is an infrequent occurrence, and many cases of tracheomalacia can be managed without tracheostomy (no recommendation). Issue 5. Prospective level V data suggest that about 5% to 10% of operations for substernal goiters are performed because of recurrent or persistent disease, although retrospective level V data report an even higher rate, up to 37%. The most common initial operations with recurrence or persistence appear to be subtotal or hemithyroidectomy (no recommendation). Evidence-based recommendations provide reliable information regarding the pathologic findings and operative management of substernal goiters in expert hands.",Journal Article,4221.0,126.0,A number of reports have been published concerning the surgical treatment of substernal goiters however there is yet to be a comprehensive review of this body of literature using evidence-based methodology This article is a systematic review of the literature using evidence-based criteria and a review of unpublished data from our institution Issue 1 Limited level III/IV data suggest that the incidence of cancer in substernal goiters is not higher than the incidence of cancer in goiters Risk factors for malignancy in substernal goiters may include a family history of pathology a history of radiation therapy recurrent goiter and the presence of adenopathy grade C recommendation Issue 2 Prospective level V data suggest that for most patients expert endocrine surgeons utilize an extracervical approach approximately 2 of the time to remove a substernal goiter safely a sternotomy or thoracotomy appears more likely in cases of a primary substernal goiter or a mass larger than the thoracic inlet no recommendation Issue 3 There may be a higher rate of permanent hypoparathyroidism and unintentional permanent recurrent nerve injury when total thyroidectomy is performed for removal of a substernal goiter than for removal of a goiter alone grade C recommendation Injury of the external branch of the superior nerve was not specifically addressed and is almost certainly underreported Issue 4 The presence of a substernal goiter especially being present more than 5 years and causing significant tracheal compression is likely a risk factor for tracheomalacia and tracheostomy grade C recommendation Tracheomalacia with substernal goiter is an infrequent occurrence and many cases of tracheomalacia can be managed without tracheostomy no recommendation Issue 5 Prospective level V data suggest that about 5 to 10 of operations for substernal goiters are performed because of recurrent or persistent disease although retrospective level V data report an even higher rate up to 37 The most common initial operations with recurrence or persistence appear to be subtotal or hemithyroidectomy no recommendation Evidence-based recommendations provide reliable information regarding the pathologic findings and operative management of substernal goiters in expert hands,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,"[8, 207, 1, 1198, 47, 85, 983, 4243, 3, 221, 24, 1, 19660, 25063, 137, 125, 16, 1145, 6, 40, 8, 949, 206, 1, 26, 642, 1, 789, 75, 241, 90, 3209, 26, 946, 16, 8, 1556, 206, 1, 3, 789, 75, 241, 90, 371, 2, 8, 206, 1, 16010, 74, 29, 114, 731, 2537, 14, 383, 301, 316, 478, 74, 309, 17, 3, 287, 1, 12, 4, 19660, 25063, 16, 44, 142, 76, 3, 287, 1, 12, 4, 25063, 43, 130, 9, 710, 4, 19660, 25063, 68, 643, 8, 607, 532, 1, 1117, 8, 532, 1, 121, 36, 387, 16309, 2, 3, 463, 1, 7741, 88, 256, 3347, 2537, 18, 482, 301, 603, 74, 309, 17, 9, 96, 7, 2005, 1293, 1613, 6391, 35, 38497, 353, 705, 18, 1, 3, 98, 6, 7930, 8, 19660, 16309, 2268, 8, 23295, 15, 6103, 1233, 80, 322, 4, 140, 1, 8, 86, 19660, 16309, 15, 8, 782, 1077, 76, 3, 2098, 22397, 77, 3347, 2537, 27, 125, 68, 40, 8, 142, 116, 1, 4377, 23587, 2, 17350, 4377, 387, 2476, 2730, 198, 181, 5949, 16, 173, 9, 2829, 1, 8, 19660, 16309, 76, 9, 2829, 1, 8, 16309, 279, 88, 256, 3347, 2730, 1, 3, 1455, 7769, 1, 3, 1123, 2476, 10, 44, 1225, 2814, 2, 16, 2214, 13486, 14900, 2537, 39, 3, 463, 1, 8, 19660, 16309, 1093, 486, 364, 80, 76, 33, 60, 2, 3440, 93, 12898, 3481, 16, 322, 8, 43, 161, 9, 38648, 2, 15648, 88, 256, 3347, 38648, 5, 19660, 16309, 16, 35, 4475, 2291, 2, 445, 140, 1, 38648, 122, 40, 2231, 187, 15648, 77, 3347, 2537, 33, 482, 301, 603, 74, 309, 17, 545, 33, 6, 79, 1, 3867, 9, 19660, 25063, 32, 173, 408, 1, 387, 15, 1882, 34, 242, 459, 301, 603, 74, 414, 35, 871, 142, 116, 126, 6, 567, 3, 96, 186, 388, 3867, 5, 146, 15, 4108, 1322, 6, 40, 5503, 15, 38649, 77, 3347, 241, 90, 883, 377, 2450, 487, 666, 3, 510, 272, 2, 1208, 284, 1, 19660, 25063, 4, 2005, 10648]",2268.0,18266028,273
Cyclooxygenase-2 in cervical neoplasia: a review.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2008-02-13,"Previous data demonstrate an association between cyclooxygenase activity and development of cervical cancer. This review investigates the role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the development of cervical cancer and potential therapeutic options targeting this pathway. A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE 1997-2007 utilizing the terms inflammation, cervical cancer, cyclooxygenase, COX-2, indomethacin, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and squamous cell cancer. Articles were included based on the quality of the study and pertinence to the topic. Other sources were culled from the references of the articles identified. Over 150 abstracts were reviewed for inclusion. Studies in vivo and in vitro confirm the role of COX-2 in the development of cervical cancer. In addition, COX-2 overexpression is associated with an increase in angiogenesis markers. Clinical correlation found that COX-2 overexpression in cervical cancer patients is a poor prognostic marker associated with increased risk for recurrent or metastatic disease. Despite early promise, two phase II trials in use of specific COX-2 inhibitors as radio-sensitizers in locally advanced cervical cancer demonstrated increased toxicity with no change in therapeutic effect. Results of studies using COX-2 inhibitors in pre-invasive cervical disease are encouraging.

Social factors affecting treatment of cervical cancer: ethical issues and policy implications.,Obstetrics and gynecology,Obstet Gynecol,2008-03-01,"Health care in the United States has become a privilege rather than a right. Patients who have the greatest need are the ones most likely to be denied this privilege. Despite recent advances in disease detection and treatment, many patients do not receive even the bare minimum of care. The high complexity of the health care system in the setting of patients with low levels of health literacy significantly affects the ability to seek and receive treatment in a timely fashion.

Sensitivity of squamous cell carcinoma lymph node metastases to herpes oncolytic therapy.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2008-03-01,"Cancer metastases may have phenotypic and genetic differences from their primary cancers of origin. Engineered, replication-competent, attenuated viruses based on herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) have shown potent oncolytic effects in treating primary tumors in animal tumor models, but their efficacy in treating lymph node metastases is poorly understood. We compared the efficacy of an attenuated oncolytic HSV-1 (NV1023) in treating a series of murine squamous carcinoma cell lines derived from serial implantation and harvest from metastatic lymph nodes. The auricles of C3H/HeJ mice were implanted with SCCVII. Cervical nodal metastases were isolated, expanded in vitro, and reimplanted into new mice. A series of cell lines (LN1-LN7) were generated through seven serial passages. Cells from higher LN passages showed consistent trends toward increased migratory and invasive ability, increased cell surface nectin-1 (an HSV-1 receptor) expression, and increased glycoprotein D binding. Exposure to NV1023 showed increased viral entry, replication, and cytotoxicity with higher LN passages. Intratumoral injection of NV1023 in a murine flank tumor model caused significantly greater tumor regression and increased viral infection of LN7 compared with SCCVII. These results show that lymph node metastases may undergo selection for characteristics, including increased nectin-1 expression, that make them more sensitive targets for herpes oncolytic therapy.

Perceived stress is associated with impaired T-cell response to HPV16 in women with cervical dysplasia.,Annals of behavioral medicine : a publication of the Society of Behavioral Medicine,Ann Behav Med,2008-02-13,"Infection with high-risk subtypes of human papillomavirus (HPV) is a central factor in the development of cervical neoplasia. Cell-mediated immunity against HPV16 plays an important role in the resolution of HPV infection and in controlling cervical disease progression. Research suggests that stress is associated with cervical disease progression, but few studies have examined the biological mechanisms that may be driving this association. This study examines whether stress is associated with immune response to HPV16 among women with cervical dysplasia. Seventy-four women presenting for colposcopy completed measures of health behaviors, stressful life events and perceived stress. A blood sample was obtained to evaluate proliferative T-cell response to HPV16, and a cervical sample was obtained during gynecologic exam for HPV-typing. More than 55% tested positive for one or more HPV subtypes. Women who did not show proliferative responses to HPV (i.e. non-responders) were more likely to be HPV(+) compared to women who had a response (i.e. responders). Consistent with study hypotheses, logistic regression revealed that higher levels of perceived stress were associated with a non-response to HPV16, controlling for relevant covariates. Stressful life events were not associated with T-cell response to HPV. Higher levels of perceived stress are associated with impaired HPV-specific immune response in women with cervical dysplasia, suggesting a potential mechanism by which stress may influence cervical disease progression.",Journal Article,4360.0,23.0,Infection with high-risk subtypes of human papillomavirus HPV is a central factor in the development of neoplasia Cell-mediated immunity against HPV16 plays an important role in the resolution of HPV infection and in controlling disease progression Research suggests that stress is associated with disease progression but few studies have examined the biological mechanisms that may be driving this association This study examines whether stress is associated with immune response to HPV16 among women with dysplasia Seventy-four women presenting for colposcopy completed measures of health behaviors stressful life events and perceived stress A blood sample was obtained to evaluate proliferative T-cell response to HPV16 and a sample was obtained during gynecologic exam for HPV-typing More than 55 tested positive for one or more HPV subtypes Women who did not show proliferative responses to HPV i.e non-responders were more likely to be HPV compared to women who had a response i.e responders Consistent with study hypotheses logistic regression revealed that higher levels of perceived stress were associated with a non-response to HPV16 controlling for relevant covariates Stressful life events were not associated with T-cell response to HPV Higher levels of perceived stress are associated with impaired HPV-specific immune response in women with dysplasia suggesting a potential mechanism by which stress may influence disease progression,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[930, 5, 64, 43, 814, 1, 171, 3242, 933, 16, 8, 854, 161, 4, 3, 193, 1, 2298, 31, 517, 1604, 480, 4048, 1698, 35, 305, 200, 4, 3, 2125, 1, 933, 930, 2, 4, 1893, 34, 91, 389, 844, 17, 1531, 16, 41, 5, 34, 91, 84, 1021, 94, 47, 409, 3, 1037, 483, 17, 68, 40, 4057, 26, 248, 26, 45, 4468, 317, 1531, 16, 41, 5, 250, 51, 6, 4048, 107, 117, 5, 2253, 2073, 294, 117, 1656, 9, 9946, 781, 1018, 1, 341, 3704, 15927, 358, 281, 2, 2588, 1531, 8, 315, 1000, 10, 683, 6, 376, 2441, 102, 31, 51, 6, 4048, 2, 8, 1000, 10, 683, 190, 1512, 6747, 9, 933, 10656, 80, 76, 614, 650, 109, 9, 104, 15, 80, 933, 814, 117, 54, 205, 44, 514, 2441, 253, 6, 933, 70, 563, 220, 1983, 11, 80, 322, 6, 40, 933, 72, 6, 117, 54, 42, 8, 51, 70, 563, 1983, 925, 5, 45, 6243, 812, 320, 553, 17, 142, 148, 1, 2588, 1531, 11, 41, 5, 8, 220, 51, 6, 4048, 1893, 9, 867, 2489, 15927, 358, 281, 11, 44, 41, 5, 102, 31, 51, 6, 933, 142, 148, 1, 2588, 1531, 32, 41, 5, 2364, 933, 112, 250, 51, 4, 117, 5, 2253, 802, 8, 174, 670, 20, 92, 1531, 68, 1054, 34, 91]",1448.0,18347908,34

Cancer Res.,2008-04-01,"Cancer diagnosis and treatment imparts chronic stressors affecting quality of life (QOL) and basic physiology. However, the capacity to increase survival by improving QOL is controversial. Patients with cervical cancer, in particular, have severely compromised QOL, providing a population well-suited for the evaluation of novel psychosocial interventions and the exploration of mechanisms by which modulation of the psychoneuroimmune axis might result in improved clinical outcomes. A randomized clinical trial was conducted in cervical cancer survivors that were enrolled at >or=13 and <22 months after diagnosis (n=50), comparing a unique psychosocial telephone counseling (PTC) intervention to usual care. QOL and biological specimens (saliva and blood) were collected at baseline and 4 months post-enrollment. The PTC intervention yielded significantly improved QOL (P=0.011). Changes in QOL were significantly associated with a shift of immune system T helper type 1 and 2 (Th1/Th2) bias, as measured by IFN-gamma/interleukin-5 ELISpot T lymphocyte precursor frequency; improved QOL being associated with increased Th1 bias (P=0.012). Serum interleukin-10 and the neuroendocrine variables of cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone revealed trends supporting this shift in immunologic stance and suggested a PTC-mediated decrease of the subject's chronic stress response. This study documents the utility of a unique PTC intervention and an association between changes in QOL and adaptive immunity (T helper class).

A retrospective review was conducted at 3 major gynecologic cancer centers of all primary CCCC between 1982 and 2004. CCCC was confirmed in 34 patients. Median age was 53 years. DES exposure was confirmed in 2 (6%) patients. A history of smoking was elicited in 22%, and of abnormal Pap smear 18% patients. Primary surgical resection was performed in all stage I or IIA patients (n=26); they displayed superior 3-year overall survival (OS) compared to advanced stage (n=8) patients (91% vs. 22%, p<0.001).

Gene expression changes in cervical squamous cell carcinoma after initiation of chemoradiation and correlation with clinical outcome.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2008-05-01,"The purpose of this study was to investigate early gene expression changes after chemoradiation in a human solid tumor, allowing identification of chemoradiation-induced gene expression changes in the tumor as well as the tumor microenvironment. In addition we aimed to identify a gene expression profile that was associated with clinical outcome. Microarray experiments were performed on cervical cancer specimens obtained before and 48 h after chemoradiation from 12 patients with Stage IB2 to IIIB squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix treated between April 2001 and August 2002. A total of 262 genes were identified that were significantly changed after chemoradiation. Genes involved in DNA repair were identified including DDB2, ERCC4, GADD45A, and XPC. In addition, significantly regulated cell-to-cell signaling pathways included insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), interferon, and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling. At a median follow-up of 41 months, 5 of 12 patients had experienced either local or distant failure. Supervised clustering analysis identified a 58-gene set from the pretreatment samples that were differentially expressed between patients with and without recurrence. Genes involved in integrin signaling and apoptosis pathways were identified in this gene set. Immortalization-upregulated protein (IMUP), IGF-2, and ARHD had particularly marked differences in expression between patients with and without recurrence. Genetic profiling identified genes regulated by chemoradiation including DNA damage and cell-to-cell signaling pathways. Genes associated with recurrence were identified that will require validation in an independent patient data set to determine whether the 58-gene set associated with clinical outcome could be useful as a prognostic assay.",Journal Article,4282.0,28.0,The purpose of this study was to investigate early gene expression changes after chemoradiation in a human solid tumor allowing identification of chemoradiation-induced gene expression changes in the tumor as well as the tumor microenvironment In addition we aimed to identify a gene expression profile that was associated with clinical outcome Microarray experiments were performed on cancer specimens obtained before and 48 h after chemoradiation from 12 patients with Stage IB2 to IIIB squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix treated between April 2001 and August 2002 A total of 262 genes were identified that were significantly changed after chemoradiation Genes involved in DNA repair were identified including DDB2 ERCC4 GADD45A and XPC In addition significantly regulated cell-to-cell signaling pathways included insulin-like growth factor-1 IGF-1 interferon and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling At a median follow-up of 41 months 5 of 12 patients had experienced either local or distant failure Supervised clustering analysis identified a 58-gene set from the pretreatment samples that were differentially expressed between patients with and without recurrence Genes involved in integrin signaling and apoptosis pathways were identified in this gene set Immortalization-upregulated protein IMUP IGF-2 and ARHD had particularly marked differences in expression between patients with and without recurrence Genetic profiling identified genes regulated by chemoradiation including DNA damage and cell-to-cell signaling pathways Genes associated with recurrence were identified that will require validation in an independent patient data set to determine whether the 58-gene set associated with clinical outcome could be useful as a prognostic assay,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[3, 743, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 963, 191, 145, 55, 400, 50, 975, 4, 8, 171, 537, 30, 2952, 911, 1, 975, 277, 145, 55, 400, 4, 3, 30, 22, 149, 22, 3, 30, 995, 4, 352, 21, 1295, 6, 255, 8, 145, 55, 800, 17, 10, 41, 5, 38, 228, 1727, 2332, 11, 173, 23, 12, 623, 683, 348, 2, 576, 555, 50, 975, 29, 133, 7, 5, 82, 9537, 6, 3036, 691, 31, 134, 1, 3, 3629, 73, 59, 2292, 1758, 2, 2480, 1544, 8, 181, 1, 7801, 214, 11, 108, 17, 11, 97, 2368, 50, 975, 214, 646, 4, 261, 972, 11, 108, 141, 12420, 13166, 30934, 2, 9522, 4, 352, 97, 1065, 31, 6, 31, 314, 460, 159, 1601, 733, 129, 161, 14, 1273, 14, 1688, 2, 756, 845, 129, 161, 314, 28, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 605, 53, 33, 1, 133, 7, 42, 592, 361, 293, 15, 626, 496, 7762, 3147, 65, 108, 8, 717, 145, 916, 29, 3, 1194, 347, 17, 11, 2478, 570, 59, 7, 5, 2, 187, 146, 214, 646, 4, 2876, 314, 2, 351, 460, 11, 108, 4, 26, 145, 916, 20169, 2684, 178, 56997, 1273, 18, 2, 56998, 42, 823, 2003, 362, 4, 55, 59, 7, 5, 2, 187, 146, 336, 1080, 108, 214, 1065, 20, 975, 141, 261, 1350, 2, 31, 6, 31, 314, 460, 214, 41, 5, 146, 11, 108, 17, 303, 1353, 929, 4, 35, 306, 69, 74, 916, 6, 223, 317, 3, 717, 145, 916, 41, 5, 38, 228, 359, 40, 999, 22, 8, 177, 719]",1764.0,18406887,255
p53 Loss synergizes with estrogen and papillomaviral oncogenes to induce cervical and breast cancers.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2008-04-01,"Whereas the tumor suppressor p53 gene is frequently mutated in most human cancers, this is not the case in human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers, presumably because the viral E6 oncoprotein inactivates the p53 protein. The ability of E6 to transform cells in tissue culture and induce cancers in mice correlates in part with its ability to inactivate p53. In this study, we compared the expression of the HPV16 E6 oncogene to the conditional genetic disruption of p53 in the context of a mouse model for cervical cancer in which estrogen is a critical cofactor. Nearly all of the K14Crep53(f/f) mice treated with estrogen developed cervical cancer, a stark contrast to its complete absence in like-treated K14E6(WT)p53(f/f) mice, indicating that HPV16 E6 must only partially inactivate p53. p53-independent activities of E6 also contributed to carcinogenesis, but in the female reproductive tract, these activities were manifested only in the presence of the HPV16 E7 oncogene. Interestingly, treatment of K14Crep53(f/f) mice with estrogen also resulted in mammary tumors after only a short latency, many of which were positive for estrogen receptor alpha. The majority of these mammary tumors were of mixed cell types, suggestive of their originating from a multipotent progenitor. Furthermore, a subset of mammary tumors arising in the estrogen-treated, p53-deficient mammary glands exhibited evidence of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition. These data show the importance of the synergy between estrogen and p53 insufficiency in determining basic properties of carcinogenesis in hormone-responsive tissues, such as the breast and the reproductive tract.",Journal Article,4312.0,43.0,Whereas the tumor suppressor p53 gene is frequently mutated in most human cancers this is not the case in human papillomavirus HPV -associated cancers presumably because the viral E6 oncoprotein inactivates the p53 protein The ability of E6 to transform cells in tissue culture and induce cancers in mice correlates in part with its ability to inactivate p53 In this study we compared the expression of the HPV16 E6 oncogene to the conditional genetic disruption of p53 in the context of a mouse model for cancer in which estrogen is a critical cofactor Nearly all of the K14Crep53 f/f mice treated with estrogen developed cancer a stark contrast to its complete absence in like-treated K14E6 WT p53 f/f mice indicating that HPV16 E6 must only partially inactivate p53 p53-independent activities of E6 also contributed to carcinogenesis but in the female reproductive tract these activities were manifested only in the presence of the HPV16 E7 oncogene Interestingly treatment of K14Crep53 f/f mice with estrogen also resulted in mammary tumors after only a short latency many of which were positive for estrogen receptor alpha The majority of these mammary tumors were of mixed cell types suggestive of their originating from a multipotent progenitor Furthermore a subset of mammary tumors arising in the estrogen-treated p53-deficient mammary glands exhibited evidence of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition These data show the importance of the synergy between estrogen and p53 insufficiency in determining basic properties of carcinogenesis in hormone-responsive tissues such as the and the reproductive tract,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[547, 3, 30, 1245, 624, 145, 16, 746, 1185, 4, 96, 171, 163, 26, 16, 44, 3, 473, 4, 171, 3242, 933, 41, 163, 8682, 408, 3, 1667, 4837, 6159, 14521, 3, 624, 178, 3, 801, 1, 4837, 6, 7136, 37, 4, 246, 2099, 2, 1290, 163, 4, 399, 1871, 4, 760, 5, 211, 801, 6, 13772, 624, 4, 26, 45, 21, 72, 3, 55, 1, 3, 4048, 4837, 1836, 6, 3, 3212, 336, 3220, 1, 624, 4, 3, 1533, 1, 8, 830, 202, 9, 12, 4, 92, 808, 16, 8, 740, 17137, 1857, 62, 1, 3, 45088, 1068, 1068, 399, 73, 5, 808, 276, 12, 8, 16702, 748, 6, 211, 236, 1127, 4, 733, 73, 19516, 1820, 624, 1068, 1068, 399, 1716, 17, 4048, 4837, 1642, 158, 2995, 13772, 624, 624, 306, 2042, 1, 4837, 120, 3447, 6, 1719, 84, 4, 3, 1061, 3705, 1696, 46, 2042, 11, 6023, 158, 4, 3, 463, 1, 3, 4048, 4540, 1836, 2873, 24, 1, 45088, 1068, 1068, 399, 5, 808, 120, 627, 4, 1903, 57, 50, 158, 8, 978, 5301, 445, 1, 92, 11, 109, 9, 808, 153, 950, 3, 686, 1, 46, 1903, 57, 11, 1, 1739, 31, 630, 3832, 1, 136, 6794, 29, 8, 16392, 2520, 798, 8, 697, 1, 1903, 57, 2635, 4, 3, 808, 73, 624, 1971, 1903, 3966, 1416, 241, 1, 35, 701, 6, 1569, 1970, 46, 74, 514, 3, 1187, 1, 3, 3439, 59, 808, 2, 624, 4360, 4, 2196, 2795, 1571, 1, 1719, 4, 785, 2443, 742, 225, 22, 3, 2, 3, 3705, 1696]",1617.0,18413729,592

More serious toxicities (grade 3 and 4) included anemia in 41%, leukopenia in 30%, neutropenia in 26%, and infection in 26%. No treatment related deaths were reported. Four patients (15%) had partial responses with a median response duration of 4.4 months. The response rate for non-radiated or radiated disease sites was 25% and 7% respectively. Sixteen patients (59%) had stable disease and seven (26%) patients had increasing disease. Median progression free survival (PFS) was 3.1 months and overall survival (OS) was 7.4 months.

Dose to larynx predicts for swallowing complications after intensity-modulated radiotherapy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2008-05-28,"To evaluate early swallowing after intensity-modulated radiotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and determine factors correlating with aspiration and/or stricture. Consecutive patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy between September 2004 and August 2006 at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute/Brigham and Women's Hospital were evaluated with institutional review board approval. Patients underwent swallowing evaluation after completion of therapy; including video swallow studies. The clinical- and treatment-related variables were examined for correlation with aspiration or strictures, as well as doses to the larynx, pharyngeal constrictor muscles, and cervical esophagus. The correlation was assessed with logistic regression analysis. A total of 96 patients were evaluated. Their median age was 55 years, and 79 (82%) were men. The primary site of cancer was the oropharynx in 43, hypopharynx/larynx in 17, oral cavity in 13, nasopharynx in 11, maxillary sinus in 2, and unknown primary in 10. Of the 96 patients, 85% underwent definitive RT and 15% postoperative RT. Also, 28 patients underwent induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy, 59 received concurrent chemotherapy, and 9 patients underwent RT alone. The median follow-up was 10 months. Of the 96 patients, 31 (32%) had clinically significant aspiration and 36 (37%) developed a stricture. The radiation dose-volume metrics, including the volume of the larynx receiving >or=50 Gy (p = 0.04 and p = 0.03, respectively) and volume of the inferior constrictor receiving >or=50 Gy (p = 0.05 and p = 0.02, respectively) were significantly associated with both aspiration and stricture. The mean larynx dose correlated with aspiration (p = 0.003). Smoking history was the only clinical factor to correlate with stricture (p = 0.05) but not aspiration.

It is clear that the subject of vaccinating young women against a sexually transmitted infection has incited a candid debate among all groups involved. Therefore, we must make the most appropriate and accurate information available to the public and medical communities. The development of vaccines targeted against oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types has made it possible to eliminate approximately 70% of all invasive cervical cancers in women worldwide. However, knowledge about HPV infection and cervical cancer, as well as the need to vaccinate against oncogenic HPV infection, is still lacking among women and physicians. This deficiency could be a key reason why some parents continue to have reservations about vaccinating their daughters. In order for HPV vaccination programs to be highly successful, multiple barriers must be overcome.

Age considerations when vaccinating against HPV.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2008-05-01,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have been shown to be both highly effective and safe, and there is now considerable enthusiasm among healthcare providers to use the vaccines to reduce the burden of HPV-associated disease in women. When considering who should be vaccinated, it is important that providers understand the complex relationships between age and HPV infections. HPV infections and cervical cancer have a widespread impact on society. Cervical cancer is the cause of a significant amount of morbidity and mortality throughout the world, making it crucial to implement prophylactic HPV vaccines to prevent cervical cancer. Nationally, the target group for vaccination is pre-adolescent females who have not been sexually active or who have recently become sexually active. In the United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends HPV vaccination for females aged 11 to 12 years. ""Catch-up"" vaccination of females aged 13 to 26 years who have not been previously vaccinated or who have missed a vaccination is also recommended, as females within this age group have the highest prevalence of HPV infection. Vaccination can still benefit females over the age of 26 years who have not been previously exposed to HPV 6, 11, 16, or 18 and those who may have new sexual partners in the future.

We analyzed the published literature in search of all articles addressing surgical techniques, intraoperative and perioperative outcomes in patient undergoing radical hysterectomy by the minimally invasive approach. Recurrence and overall survival rates in patients with early-stage cervical cancer are equivalent in patients who undergo laparoscopic radical hysterectomy and those who undergo surgery performed by laparotomy. There is growing evidence highlighting the benefits of robotic surgery in management of gynecologic malignancies. The advantages of the robotic system include three-dimensional vision, tremor reduction, seven degrees of intra-abdominal articulation, and motion scaling. Recent studies comparing radical hysterectomy performed through the open, laparoscopic, or robotics approach showed that there were no significant differences in intra- or postoperative complications among the three groups and no conversion in the robotic or laparoscopic groups.

Lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node detection in women with cervical cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2008-05-27,"Lymphatic mapping and sentinel node detection have been applied to almost every solid tumor and sentinel node status have become part of the American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) staging criteria in both breast cancer and malignant melanoma. As the presence of metastatic disease in lymph nodes is the most important prognostic factor on survival in women with cervical cancer, the ability to reliably detect sentinel nodes might triage women to adjuvant radiotherapy without the need for full lymphadenectomies and their associated morbidity. To date, multiple international investigators have performed single institution investigations with promising results. Overall, 831 women have been undergoing lymphatic mapping and sentinel node detection as part of their cervical cancer therapy as reported in the literature. Combining results from all these studies, a sentinel node was identified in 90% of cases with an overall sensitivity of detecting metastatic disease of 92% with an 8% false negative rate.

Cervix regression and motion during the course of external beam chemoradiation for cervical cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2008-05-29,"To evaluate the magnitude of cervix regression and motion during external beam chemoradiation for cervical cancer. Sixteen patients with cervical cancer underwent computed tomography scanning before, weekly during, and after conventional chemoradiation. Cervix volumes were calculated to determine the extent of cervix regression. Changes in the center of mass and perimeter of the cervix between scans were used to determine the magnitude of cervix motion. Maximum cervix position changes were calculated for each patient, and mean maximum changes were calculated for the group. Mean cervical volumes before and after 45 Gy of external beam irradiation were 97.0 and 31.9 cc, respectively; mean volume reduction was 62.3%. Mean maximum changes in the center of mass of the cervix were 2.1, 1.6, and 0.82 cm in the superior-inferior, anterior-posterior, and right-left lateral dimensions, respectively. Mean maximum changes in the perimeter of the cervix were 2.3 and 1.3 cm in the superior and inferior, 1.7 and 1.8 cm in the anterior and posterior, and 0.76 and 0.94 cm in the right and left lateral directions, respectively.

Involvement of Rac in fenretinide-induced apoptosis.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2008-06-01,"The synthetic retinoid N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4HPR) has shown potential as a chemopreventive and therapeutic agent. The ability of 4HPR to enhance production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to apoptosis has been suggested as a possible mechanism underlying these effects. We explored the possibility that ROS induction by 4HPR involves the small GTPase Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (Rac), a regulatory subunit of the NADPH oxidase complex. Rac was activated in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells as early as 5 minutes following 4HPR exposure. Moreover, inhibition of Rac activity or silencing of its expression by RNA interference decreased ROS generation in human head and neck, lung, and cervical cancer cells and murine melanoma cells. In HNSCC UMSCC-22B cells, this decrease correlated with reduction in apoptosis induction by 4HPR. Expression of a constitutive active mutant Rac increased basal and 4HPR-induced ROS generation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. In addition, the metastatic DM14 cells exhibited higher Rac activation following 4HPR treatment compared with the primary Tu167-C2 cells. Furthermore, the metastatic cancer cells tested exhibited higher ROS generation and growth inhibition due to 4HPR exposure compared with their primary cancer cell counterparts. These findings show a preferential susceptibility of metastatic cells to the proapoptotic retinoid 4HPR through Rac activation and support the use of ROS-inducing agents such as 4HPR against metastatic cancer cells.",Journal Article,4251.0,20.0,The synthetic retinoid N- 4-hydroxyphenyl retinamide 4HPR has shown potential as a chemopreventive and therapeutic agent The ability of 4HPR to enhance production of reactive oxygen species ROS leading to apoptosis has been suggested as a possible mechanism underlying these effects We explored the possibility that ROS induction by 4HPR involves the small GTPase Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate Rac a regulatory subunit of the NADPH oxidase complex Rac was activated in human head and squamous cell carcinoma HNSCC cells as early as 5 minutes following 4HPR exposure Moreover inhibition of Rac activity or silencing of its expression by RNA interference decreased ROS generation in human head and and cancer cells and murine cells In HNSCC UMSCC-22B cells this decrease correlated with reduction in apoptosis induction by 4HPR Expression of a constitutive active mutant Rac increased basal and 4HPR-induced ROS generation and poly ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage In addition the metastatic DM14 cells exhibited higher Rac activation following 4HPR treatment compared with the primary Tu167-C2 cells Furthermore the metastatic cancer cells tested exhibited higher ROS generation and growth inhibition due to 4HPR exposure compared with their primary cancer cell counterparts These findings show a preferential susceptibility of metastatic cells to the proapoptotic retinoid 4HPR through Rac activation and support the use of ROS-inducing agents such as 4HPR against metastatic cancer cells,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[3, 3273, 6709, 78, 39, 26107, 28004, 14630, 71, 443, 174, 22, 8, 4401, 2, 189, 420, 3, 801, 1, 14630, 6, 1304, 1529, 1, 2163, 2848, 2915, 2609, 1049, 6, 351, 71, 85, 1148, 22, 8, 899, 670, 1181, 46, 176, 21, 1443, 3, 2526, 17, 2609, 504, 20, 14630, 2921, 3, 302, 9189, 1102, 139, 8732, 31295, 8848, 4235, 11173, 8, 1253, 3350, 1, 3, 16029, 10447, 840, 11173, 10, 735, 4, 171, 718, 2, 691, 31, 134, 1209, 37, 22, 191, 22, 33, 2511, 366, 14630, 645, 1393, 297, 1, 11173, 128, 15, 2077, 1, 211, 55, 20, 893, 3182, 340, 2609, 914, 4, 171, 718, 2, 2, 12, 37, 2, 1471, 37, 4, 1209, 57108, 57109, 37, 26, 775, 438, 5, 628, 4, 351, 504, 20, 14630, 55, 1, 8, 3178, 544, 620, 11173, 101, 2135, 2, 14630, 277, 2609, 914, 2, 2699, 3638, 3507, 1451, 3155, 4, 352, 3, 113, 34296, 37, 1416, 142, 11173, 363, 366, 14630, 24, 72, 5, 3, 86, 20990, 6706, 37, 798, 3, 113, 12, 37, 650, 1416, 142, 2609, 914, 2, 129, 297, 520, 6, 14630, 645, 72, 5, 136, 86, 12, 31, 3953, 46, 272, 514, 8, 6629, 1432, 1, 113, 37, 6, 3, 4118, 6709, 14630, 298, 11173, 363, 2, 538, 3, 119, 1, 2609, 1958, 183, 225, 22, 14630, 480, 113, 12, 37]",1497.0,18519704,729

Dosimetric comparison of bone marrow-sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy versus conventional techniques for treatment of cervical cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int.

Phys.,2008-08-01,"To compare bone marrow-sparing intensity-modulated pelvic radiotherapy (BMS-IMRT) with conventional (four-field box and anteroposterior-posteroanterior [AP-PA]) techniques in the treatment of cervical cancer. The data from 7 cervical cancer patients treated with concurrent chemotherapy and IMRT without BMS were analyzed and compared with data using four-field box and AP-PA techniques. All plans were normalized to cover the planning target volume with the 99% isodose line. The clinical target volume consisted of the pelvic and presacral lymph nodes, uterus and cervix, upper vagina, and parametrial tissue. Normal tissues included bowel, bladder, and pelvic bone marrow (PBM), which comprised the lumbosacral spine and ilium and the ischium, pubis, and proximal femora (lower pelvis bone marrow). Dose-volume histograms for the planning target volume and normal tissues were compared for BMS-IMRT vs. four-field box and AP-PA plans. BMS-IMRT was superior to the four-field box technique in reducing the dose to the PBM, small bowel, rectum, and bladder. Compared with AP-PA plans, BMS-IMRT reduced the PBM volume receiving a dose >16.4 Gy. BMS-IMRT reduced the volume of ilium, lower pelvis bone marrow, and bowel receiving a dose >27.7, >18.7, and >21.1 Gy, respectively, but increased dose below these thresholds compared with the AP-PA plans. BMS-IMRT reduced the volume of lumbosacral spine bone marrow, rectum, small bowel, and bladder at all dose levels in all 7 patients. BMS-IMRT reduced irradiation of PBM compared with the four-field box technique. Compared with the AP-PA technique, BMS-IMRT reduced lumbosacral spine bone marrow irradiation and reduced the volume of PBM irradiated to high doses.

Prospective data of 30 stage I cervical cancer patients enrolled in an ongoing study were evaluated in combination with a medical chart review. Eight patients (27%) did not have any stenosis of the neo-cervix postoperatively; 10 (33%) had clinically notable stenosis not requiring neo-cervical dilation to allow adequate sampling; moreover, 12 (40%) had sufficient stenosis requiring a neo-cervical dilation procedure, which proved to be safe and useful. The majority of the dilation procedures (n=8) were conducted under local anesthesia in the office. At preoperative baseline survey, women reported a high rate of sexual inactivity. Fear of intercourse and dyspareunia were reported prior to surgery; however, trends of adjustment and improvement were noted over time postoperatively. Overall, fear of sexual activity tended to lessen if the degree of dyspareunia decreased over time. Postoperative dyspareunia decreased over time, which could have been associated with the mechanical stretching due to vaginal dilator use or dilating benefit of intercourse. Postoperative concerns associated with radical trachelectomy may be greater than what has been reported in the literature; however, several adjustment trends were noted with intermediate/long-term follow-up.

Ultrastaging improves detection of metastases in sentinel lymph nodes of uterine cervix squamous cell carcinoma.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2008-09-01,"The technique of sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection is increasingly being applied in patients with uterine cervix carcinoma. This study presents the pathologic findings of SLNs in 48 such patients. The institutional pathology files were searched for all patients with a diagnosis of cervical squamous cell carcinoma who had SLNs reported. Patient age, follow-up, tumor size, presence/absence of lymphatic invasion, number and status of SLNs and non-SLNs, location of SLNs, and size of metastases in SLNs were recorded. All SLNs were sectioned in 2-mm slices perpendicular to the long axis and submitted entirely for microscopic examination. For all SLNs negative on the initial hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides, an ultrastaging protocol was performed consisting of 5 sets of slides at 40-mum intervals (1 H&E slide+2 unstained slides), representing an additional 5 intervals. Lymph nodes negative by the additional H&E intervals had immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin performed on 1 unstained slide. Forty-eight patients ranging from 25 to 62 years of age had a total of 208 SLNs removed. Fifteen (31%) patients had positive SLNs with 1 to 5 positive SLNs per case. The metastasis size ranged from a single cell to 27 mm. Twelve patients had metastasis detected by routine processing in 23 SLNs, whereas ultrastaging detected metastases in 3 SLNs of 3 additional patients. In 2 patients with metastasis detected by ultrastaging, the metastasis was detected by wide H&E intervals (level 2 for 1 patient; level 3 for 1 patient); in 1 patient, the metastasis was detected only by immunohistochemistry and consisted of a single cell. Of the 15 patients with positive SLNs, 3 patients had a total of 6 positive non-SLNs. All of the patients with a positive SLN are currently living. Thirty-three (69%) patients had negative SLNs. Of these, 1 patient had a single positive non-SLN for a false negative rate of 6.25%. Negative SLN predicts negative non-SLN. For most patients with a positive SLN, the SLN will be the only metastasis detected; a minority of patients with a positive SLN may have a positive non-SLN.",Journal Article,4159.0,46.0,The technique of sentinel lymph node SLN detection is increasingly being applied in patients with cervix carcinoma This study presents the pathologic findings of SLNs in 48 such patients The institutional pathology files were searched for all patients with a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma who had SLNs reported Patient age follow-up tumor size presence/absence of lymphatic invasion number and status of SLNs and non-SLNs location of SLNs and size of metastases in SLNs were recorded All SLNs were sectioned in 2-mm slices perpendicular to the long axis and submitted entirely for microscopic examination For all SLNs negative on the initial hematoxylin and eosin H E stained slides an ultrastaging protocol was performed consisting of 5 sets of slides at 40-mum intervals 1 H E slide+2 unstained slides representing an additional 5 intervals Lymph nodes negative by the additional H E intervals had immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin performed on 1 unstained slide Forty-eight patients ranging from 25 to 62 years of age had a total of 208 SLNs removed Fifteen 31 patients had positive SLNs with 1 to 5 positive SLNs per case The metastasis size ranged from a single cell to 27 mm Twelve patients had metastasis detected by routine processing in 23 SLNs whereas ultrastaging detected metastases in 3 SLNs of 3 additional patients In 2 patients with metastasis detected by ultrastaging the metastasis was detected by wide H E intervals level 2 for 1 patient level 3 for 1 patient in 1 patient the metastasis was detected only by immunohistochemistry and consisted of a single cell Of the 15 patients with positive SLNs 3 patients had a total of 6 positive non-SLNs All of the patients with a positive SLN are currently living Thirty-three 69 patients had negative SLNs Of these 1 patient had a single positive non-SLN for a false negative rate of 6.25 Negative SLN predicts negative non-SLN For most patients with a positive SLN the SLN will be the only metastasis detected a minority of patients with a positive SLN may have a positive non-SLN,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[3, 1312, 1, 1323, 263, 289, 1099, 638, 16, 1635, 486, 1498, 4, 7, 5, 3629, 134, 26, 45, 2740, 3, 510, 272, 1, 2642, 4, 576, 225, 7, 3, 1115, 1117, 7530, 11, 3080, 9, 62, 7, 5, 8, 147, 1, 691, 31, 134, 54, 42, 2642, 210, 69, 89, 166, 126, 30, 444, 463, 1127, 1, 2936, 578, 207, 2, 156, 1, 2642, 2, 220, 2642, 1147, 1, 2642, 2, 444, 1, 196, 4, 2642, 11, 1872, 62, 2642, 11, 18302, 4, 18, 321, 12791, 13385, 6, 3, 319, 2310, 2, 5118, 6848, 9, 2984, 1385, 9, 62, 2642, 199, 23, 3, 388, 6209, 2, 5975, 555, 563, 3386, 3830, 35, 11338, 1182, 10, 173, 2273, 1, 33, 2270, 1, 3830, 28, 327, 10615, 1582, 14, 555, 563, 7911, 18, 17677, 3830, 2861, 35, 402, 33, 1582, 263, 502, 199, 20, 3, 402, 555, 563, 1582, 42, 888, 9, 4292, 173, 23, 14, 17677, 7911, 1213, 659, 7, 2223, 29, 243, 6, 744, 60, 1, 89, 42, 8, 181, 1, 5920, 2642, 2264, 3057, 456, 7, 42, 109, 2642, 5, 14, 6, 33, 109, 2642, 379, 473, 3, 278, 444, 1869, 29, 8, 226, 31, 6, 428, 321, 2544, 7, 42, 278, 530, 20, 1311, 3325, 4, 382, 2642, 547, 11338, 530, 196, 4, 27, 2642, 1, 27, 402, 7, 4, 18, 7, 5, 278, 530, 20, 11338, 3, 278, 10, 530, 20, 1019, 555, 563, 1582, 301, 18, 9, 14, 69, 301, 27, 9, 14, 69, 4, 14, 69, 3, 278, 10, 530, 158, 20, 888, 2, 1695, 1, 8, 226, 31, 1, 3, 167, 7, 5, 109, 2642, 27, 7, 42, 8, 181, 1, 49, 109, 220, 2642, 62, 1, 3, 7, 5, 8, 109, 1099, 32, 694, 2798, 977, 169, 790, 7, 42, 199, 2642, 1, 46, 14, 69, 42, 8, 226, 109, 220, 1099, 9, 8, 2133, 199, 116, 1, 49, 243, 199, 1099, 2623, 199, 220, 1099, 9, 96, 7, 5, 8, 109, 1099, 3, 1099, 303, 40, 3, 158, 278, 530, 8, 2652, 1, 7, 5, 8, 109, 1099, 68, 47, 8, 109, 220, 1099]",2053.0,18670356,89
"Cancer health disparities among Indian and Pakistani immigrants in the United States: a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-based study from 1988 to 2003.",Cancer,Cancer,2008-09-01,"Immigrants from India and Pakistan comprise about 1.5% of the total United States population. To the author' knowledge, this is the first study analyzing epidemiologic data on Indian and Pakistani patients with newly diagnosed cancer. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database has reported cancer incidence from 1973 to 2003. Since 1988, the Indian and Pakistani population has been reported separately under race and ethnicity. Frequency and survival analyses with SEER data were performed, and descriptive parameters were calculated along with overall survival in common cancers. In total, 6889 cases were reported between 1988 and 2003, and those cases included 51% men and 49% women (P = .821). Among men, 30% of cases were prostate cancers, 10% of cases were lung cancers, and 9% of cases were colorectal cancers. Among women, 38% of cases were breast cancers, 15% of cases were genital cancers, and 7% of cases were colorectal cancers. When overall survival with common cancer was compared between immigrants and non-Hispanic whites in the United States, it was better among Indian and Pakistani immigrants. In a United States-based Indian and Pakistani population, prostate and breast cancers were the most common malignancies in men and women, respectively. This differed from the incidence in India and Pakistan, where oral cavity cancer in men and breast and cervical cancers in women were the most common. These immigrant cancer patients also had better survival. This change in demographics may be attributed to multiple factors, and the current data have implications on cancer screening and intervention.",Journal Article,4159.0,11.0,Immigrants from India and Pakistan comprise about 1.5 of the total United States population To the author knowledge this is the first study analyzing epidemiologic data on Indian and Pakistani patients with newly diagnosed cancer The Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER database has reported cancer incidence from 1973 to 2003 Since 1988 the Indian and Pakistani population has been reported separately under race and ethnicity Frequency and survival analyses with SEER data were performed and descriptive parameters were calculated along with overall survival in common cancers In total 6889 cases were reported between 1988 and 2003 and those cases included 51 men and 49 women P .821 Among men 30 of cases were cancers 10 of cases were cancers and 9 of cases were cancers Among women 38 of cases were cancers 15 of cases were genital cancers and 7 of cases were cancers When overall survival with common cancer was compared between immigrants and non-Hispanic whites in the United States it was better among Indian and Pakistani immigrants In a United States-based Indian and Pakistani population and cancers were the most common malignancies in men and women respectively This differed from the incidence in India and Pakistan where oral cavity cancer in men and and cancers in women were the most common These immigrant cancer patients also had better survival This change in demographics may be attributed to multiple factors and the current data have implications on cancer screening and intervention,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[14004, 29, 7776, 2, 38792, 5238, 545, 14, 33, 1, 3, 181, 1088, 907, 266, 6, 3, 11783, 922, 26, 16, 3, 157, 45, 4449, 3609, 74, 23, 7968, 2, 21526, 7, 5, 732, 265, 12, 3, 617, 1284, 2, 396, 99, 1605, 609, 71, 210, 12, 287, 29, 4756, 6, 1522, 1192, 3314, 3, 7968, 2, 21526, 266, 71, 85, 210, 3582, 669, 1047, 2, 2091, 675, 2, 25, 318, 5, 1605, 74, 11, 173, 2, 3778, 1038, 11, 981, 1510, 5, 63, 25, 4, 186, 163, 4, 181, 57281, 140, 11, 210, 59, 3314, 2, 1522, 2, 135, 140, 159, 725, 325, 2, 739, 117, 19, 10680, 107, 325, 201, 1, 140, 11, 163, 79, 1, 140, 11, 163, 2, 83, 1, 140, 11, 163, 107, 117, 519, 1, 140, 11, 163, 167, 1, 140, 11, 8226, 163, 2, 67, 1, 140, 11, 163, 198, 63, 25, 5, 186, 12, 10, 72, 59, 14004, 2, 220, 1776, 2556, 4, 3, 1088, 907, 192, 10, 380, 107, 7968, 2, 21526, 14004, 4, 8, 1088, 907, 90, 7968, 2, 21526, 266, 2, 163, 11, 3, 96, 186, 441, 4, 325, 2, 117, 106, 26, 2512, 29, 3, 287, 4, 7776, 2, 38792, 1257, 518, 2405, 12, 4, 325, 2, 2, 163, 4, 117, 11, 3, 96, 186, 46, 16931, 12, 7, 120, 42, 380, 25, 26, 707, 4, 2221, 68, 40, 3073, 6, 232, 130, 2, 3, 291, 74, 47, 1268, 23, 12, 453, 2, 788]",1518.0,18696716,83
Radiation treatment breaks and ulcerative mucositis in head and neck cancer.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2008-08-13,"Unplanned radiation treatment breaks and prolongation of the radiation treatment time are associated with lower survival and locoregional control rates when radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy is used in the curative treatment of head and neck cancer. Treatment of head and neck cancer is intense, involving high-dose, continuous radiotherapy, and often adding chemotherapy to radiotherapy. As the intensity of treatment regimens has escalated in recent years, clinical outcomes generally have improved. However, more intensive therapy also increases the incidence of treatment-related toxicities, particularly those impacting the mucosal lining of the oral cavity, pharynx, and cervical esophagus, and results in varying degrees of ulcerative mucositis. Ulcerative mucositis is a root cause of unscheduled radiation treatment breaks, which prolongs the total radiation treatment time. Alterations in radiotherapy and chemotherapy, including the use of continuous (i.e., 7 days/week) radiotherapy to ensure constant negative proliferative pressure, may improve efficacy outcomes. However, these approaches also increase the incidence of ulcerative mucositis, thereby increasing the incidence of unplanned radiation treatment breaks.

Surgical and pathologic outcomes of fertility-sparing radical abdominal trachelectomy for FIGO stage IB1 cervical cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2008-08-16,"To describe the surgical and pathologic findings of fertility-sparing radical abdominal trachelectomy using a standardized surgical technique, and report the rate of post-trachelectomy adjuvant therapy that results in permanent sterility. A prospectively maintained database of all patients with FIGO stage IB1 cervical cancer admitted to the operating room for planned fertility-sparing radical abdominal trachelectomy was analyzed. Sentinel node mapping was performed via cervical injection of Technetium and blue dye. Between 6/2005 and 5/2008, 22 consecutive patients with FIGO stage IB1 cervical cancer underwent laparotomy for planned fertility-sparing radical abdominal trachelectomy. Median age was 33 years (range, 23-43). Histology included 13 (59%) with adenocarcinoma and 9 (41%) with squamous carcinoma. Lymph-vascular invasion was seen in 9 (41%) cases. Only 3 (14%) needed immediate completion radical hysterectomy due to intraoperative findings (2 for positive nodes, 1 for positive endocervical margin). Median number of nodes evaluated was 23 (range, 11-44); and 6 (27%) patients had positive pelvic nodes on final pathology - all received postoperative chemoradiation. Sixteen (73%) patients agreed to participate in sentinel node mapping which yielded a detection rate of 100%, sensitivity of 83%, specificity of 100% and false-negative rate of 17%. Eighteen of 19 (95%) patients who completed trachelectomy had a cerclage placed, and 9/22 (41%) patients had no residual cervical carcinoma on final pathology. Median time in the operating room was 298 min (range, 180-425). Median estimated blood loss was 250 ml (range, 50-700), and median hospital stay was 4 days (range, 3-6). No recurrences were noted at the time of this report. Cervical adenocarcinoma and lymph-vascular invasion are common features of patients selected for radical abdominal trachelectomy. The majority of patients can undergo the operation successfully; however, nearly 32% of all selected cases will require hysterectomy or postoperative chemoradiation for oncologic reasons. Sentinel node mapping is useful but until lower false-negative rates are achieved total lymphadenectomy remains the gold standard.

A phase III randomized clinical trial comparing laparoscopic or robotic radical hysterectomy with abdominal radical hysterectomy in patients with early stage cervical cancer.,Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,J Minim Invasive Gynecol,,"Cervical cancer is a significant health problem in countries of the developing world. Although case series suggest advantages of total laparoscopic radical hysterectomy (TLRH) compared with total abdominal radical hysterectomy (TARH), no randomized controlled trial is currently available to establish TLRH as the new standard treatment. In this study, TLRH or total robotic radical hysterectomy (TRRH) will be performed without a vaginally assisted portion of the procedure. A biphasic randomized controlled trial was designed to test feasibility of recruitment and equivalence in regard to disease-free survival (Canadian Task Force classification I). Tertiary referral hospital. Patients with histologically confirmed invasive squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the cervix, stage IA1 (with lymphovascular space invasion), IA2, and IB1 are eligible. During the first phase, 100 patients will be randomized (1:1) to receive either TLRH/TRRH or TARH, with the primary end point being the rate of enrollment. During the second phase, recruitment will be extended by another 640 patients in a 1:1 TLRH/TRRH:TARH allocation, to determine equivalence with respect to disease-free survival with 80% power and alpha=0.05. Equivalence will be assumed if the difference in disease-free survival does not exceed 7% at 4 years. Secondary outcomes include treatment-related morbidity, costs and cost effectiveness, patterns of recurrence, quality of life, pelvic floor function, feasibility of intraoperative sentinel node sampling, and overall survival. All data from this multicenter study will be entered using online electronic case report forms, allowing real-time assessment of data completeness and patient follow-up. This prospective trial aims to show the equivalence of a TLRH/TRRH versus TARH approach for patients with early stage cervical cancer following a 2-phase protocol.

Oncologic outcome of fertility-sparing radical trachelectomy versus radical hysterectomy for stage IB1 cervical carcinoma.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2008-08-27,"To compare the oncologic outcomes of women who underwent a fertility-sparing radical trachelectomy (RT) to those who underwent a radical hysterectomy (RH) for stage IB1 cervical carcinoma. We performed a case-control study of all patients with stage IB1 cervical carcinoma who underwent a vaginal or abdominal RT between 11/01 and 6/07. The control group consisted of patients with stage IB1 disease who underwent an RH between 11/91 and 6/07 and who would be considered candidates for fertility-sparing surgery. Information was extracted from a prospectively acquired database. Recurrence-free and disease-specific survival (RFS and DSS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimates and compared with the log-rank test where indicated. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox regression method. Forty stage IB1 patients underwent an RT and 110 patients underwent an RH. There were no statistical differences between the two groups for the following prognostic variables: histology, median number of lymph nodes removed, node positive rate, lymph-vascular space involvement (LVSI), or deep stromal invasion (DSI). The median follow-up for the entire group was 44 months. The 5-year RFS rate was 96% (for the RT group compared to 86% for the RH group (P=NS).

Posterior stabilization strategies following resection of cervicothoracic junction tumors: review of 90 consecutive cases.,Journal of neurosurgery. Spine,J Neurosurg Spine,2008-08-01,"In this retrospective analysis the authors describe the assessment and outcomes of 90 patients who underwent placement of posterior instrumentation at the cervicothoracic junction following the resection of a primary or metastatic tumor during a 10-year period. All patients underwent a posterolateral laminectomy including uni- or bilateral facetectomy, and 44 patients additionally required vertebral body resection and reconstruction. In patients who underwent C-6 or C-7 decompression, the posterior instrumentation strategies changed from the use of lateral mass plate systems (LMPSs) to lateral mass screw/rod systems (LMSRSs). Similarly, for T1-3 tumor decompression, the strategy shifted from sublaminar hook/rod systems (SHRSs) to the use of pedicle screw systems (PSSs) in which the surgeon used either a 6.25-mm rod or dual-diameter rods with or without a connector. The overall surgical complication rate was 19% including fixation failure in 11 patients (12%), 6 of whom required reoperation. Fixation failure rates for cervical decompression decreased from 2 (29%) of 7 patients in the LMPS group to 0 (0%) of 8 in the LMSRS group (p = 0.2). The fixation failure rates for thoracic decompression were 7 (15%) of 48 patients in the SHRS group, and there was a decrease to 2 (7%) of 27 in the PSS group (p = 0.48). Neurological and functional outcomes including American Spinal Injury Association, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, and Medical Research Council muscle strength and pain scores remained stable or improved in 94, 96, 100, and 96% of patients, respectively.

Treatment patterns of FIGO Stage IB2 cervical cancer: a single-institution experience of radical hysterectomy with individualized postoperative therapy and definitive radiation therapy.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2008-09-06,"The treatment of FIGO stage IB2 cervical cancer is controversial. Our aim was to assess treatment patterns, outcomes, and complications in patients with stage IB2 cervical cancer. A retrospective study of patients with stage IB2 cervical carcinoma at a single institution between January 1982 and September 2006 was performed. To adequately control treatment variables, we only included patients who underwent their entire treatment at our institution. Toxicity was assessed using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC). We identified 82 patients, of whom 47 met the strict inclusion criteria. Of these, 27 patients (57%) underwent primary radical hysterectomy (RH) and 20 (43%) were treated with definitive radiation/chemoradiation therapy (RT/CRT). Patients selected for RT/CRT had a higher American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) score than those selected for surgery (P=0.037). The 3-year progression free survival rate was 52% for the RH group and 55% for the RT/CRT group (P=0.977). The 3-year overall survival rates were 72% and 55%, respectively (P=0.161). Overall, 52% of patients in the RH group received postoperative radiation therapy as part of their adjuvant treatment. CTC grade 3, 4, and 5 complications affected 5 patients (19%) in the RH group and 3 (15%) in the RT/CRT group.

Port-site metastases were documented in 20 of 1694 patients (1.18%) who underwent laparoscopic procedures for a malignant intraabdominal condition. Of these, 15 patients had a diagnosis of epithelial ovarian or fallopian tube carcinoma, 2 had breast cancer, 2 had cervical cancer, and 1 had uterine cancer. Nineteen of 20 patients (95%) had simultaneous carcinomatosis or metastases to other sites at the time of port-site metastasis. Patients who developed port-site metastases within 7 months from the laparoscopic procedure had a median survival of 12 months whereas patients who developed port-site metastasis >7 months had a median survival of 37 months (P=0.004). No port-site recurrence was documented in patients undergoing risk-reducing, diagnostic or therapeutic laparoscopic procedures for breast cancer without intraabdominal disease. The rate of port-site tumor implantation after laparoscopic procedures in women with malignant disease is low and almost always occurs in the setting of synchronous, advanced intraabdominal or distant metastatic disease.

We retrospectively reviewed charts of all patients referred for evaluation and treatment under the Cancer Detection Program: Every Woman Counts (CDP:EWC), the California equivalent of the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Detection and Prevention Program, in a suburban area of Los Angeles County. A total of 972 CDP:EWC screening mammograms was performed in the Antelope Valley during a 7-year study period (2000 to 2007). Sixty-two screened women aged 40 to 64 years were referred for further evaluation. Breast cancer detection rate per screening mammogram was 0.8 per cent; 80 per cent were early-stage breast cancer. The majority of the women (nine of 15) underwent breast conservation surgery. The axilla was staged using sentinel lymph node dissection and/or axillary lymph node dissection.

The MTD was determined to be cisplatin 40 mg/m(2) (maximum dose of 70 mg) and paclitaxel 40 mg/m(2) administered weekly for six cycles concurrent with extended field radiation therapy. There were 19 evaluable patients for the phase II analysis of toxicity and efficacy. Grade three and four gastrointestinal toxicity was seen in 6 and neutropenia in 7. Radiation therapy was successfully completed in 36.8% of patients at eight weeks and in 68.4% of patients at nine weeks, with a median time to completion was 56 days. A total of 27 evaluable patients were enrolled, twelve are dead (mean survival of those deceased is 25 months), and 15 (56%) are alive, and have been followed for a mean of 48 months (range 25-68; median of 46 months). Paclitaxel and cisplatin combination chemotherapy concurrent with extended field pelvic para-aortic irradiation can be administered at the described MTD and shows a higher than previously reported disease-free survival in relation to historical data. The 56% survival to date, and 50% estimated 48 month survival, warrants validation in a larger prospective cohort. Central radiation dose reduction is being considered in the next trial to decrease late toxicity of regimen.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",4082.0,37.0,To determine the maximum tolerated dose MTD of weekly paclitaxel and cisplatin chemotherapy concurrent with extended field irradiation in women with cancer metastatic to the para-aortic nodes Patients with carcinoma of the cervix and histologically documented para-aortic node metastases were eligible for this phase I/II trial Chemotherapy agents were administered weekly concurrent with extended field radiation with escalating doses of paclitaxel from 30-50 mg/m 2 in each of three cohorts of three patients each A phase II cohort was then evaluated at the selected maximum tolerated dose MTD The MTD was determined to be cisplatin 40 mg/m 2 maximum dose of 70 mg and paclitaxel 40 mg/m 2 administered weekly for six cycles concurrent with extended field radiation therapy There were 19 evaluable patients for the phase II analysis of toxicity and efficacy Grade three and four toxicity was seen in 6 and neutropenia in 7 Radiation therapy was successfully completed in 36.8 of patients at eight weeks and in 68.4 of patients at nine weeks with a median time to completion was 56 days A total of 27 evaluable patients were enrolled twelve are dead mean survival of those deceased is 25 months and 15 56 are alive and have been followed for a mean of 48 months range 25-68 median of 46 months Paclitaxel and cisplatin combination chemotherapy concurrent with extended field pelvic para-aortic irradiation can be administered at the described MTD and shows a higher than previously reported disease-free survival in relation to historical data The 56 survival to date and 50 estimated 48 month survival warrants validation in a larger prospective cohort Central radiation dose reduction is being considered in the next trial to decrease late toxicity of regimen,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[6, 223, 3, 689, 421, 61, 961, 1, 709, 490, 2, 540, 56, 750, 5, 1747, 1067, 1104, 4, 117, 5, 12, 113, 6, 3, 4615, 3938, 502, 7, 5, 134, 1, 3, 3629, 2, 2161, 1405, 4615, 3938, 289, 196, 11, 625, 9, 26, 124, 70, 215, 160, 56, 183, 11, 468, 709, 750, 5, 1747, 1067, 121, 5, 2922, 415, 1, 490, 29, 201, 212, 81, 188, 18, 4, 296, 1, 169, 736, 1, 169, 7, 296, 8, 124, 215, 180, 10, 818, 194, 28, 3, 715, 689, 421, 61, 961, 3, 961, 10, 509, 6, 40, 540, 327, 81, 188, 18, 689, 61, 1, 431, 81, 2, 490, 327, 81, 188, 18, 468, 709, 9, 437, 410, 750, 5, 1747, 1067, 121, 36, 125, 11, 326, 859, 7, 9, 3, 124, 215, 65, 1, 155, 2, 209, 88, 169, 2, 294, 155, 10, 527, 4, 49, 2, 778, 4, 67, 121, 36, 10, 1878, 781, 4, 511, 66, 1, 7, 28, 659, 244, 2, 4, 806, 39, 1, 7, 28, 762, 244, 5, 8, 52, 98, 6, 1438, 10, 664, 162, 8, 181, 1, 428, 859, 7, 11, 346, 2544, 32, 8311, 313, 25, 1, 135, 11956, 16, 243, 53, 2, 167, 664, 32, 1701, 2, 47, 85, 370, 9, 8, 313, 1, 576, 53, 184, 243, 806, 52, 1, 641, 53, 490, 2, 540, 150, 56, 750, 5, 1747, 1067, 1110, 4615, 3938, 1104, 122, 40, 468, 28, 3, 1027, 961, 2, 1949, 8, 142, 76, 373, 210, 34, 115, 25, 4, 2191, 6, 2252, 74, 3, 664, 25, 6, 1244, 2, 212, 661, 576, 811, 25, 2782, 929, 4, 8, 1077, 482, 180, 854, 121, 61, 628, 16, 486, 515, 4, 3, 1305, 160, 6, 775, 807, 155, 1, 477]",1762.0,19010522,296

Fatty Acids,2008-12-05,"Cervical cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death for women in the world. A potential target for preventing and treating cervical cancer is cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2). Curcumin is an anti-inflammatory agent that is known to have anti-cox-2 activity. In this study we examined the expression of cox-2 in cervical cancer and its precursors by immunohistochemistry. The effect of curcumin in inhibiting cervical cancer cells was determined via 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis, data analysis, and ingenuity pathway analysis. No significant differences in the expression of cox-2 in squamous cell carcinoma, and carcinoma in situ were observed. However, there was a statistically significant difference in the expression of cox-2 in adenocarcinoma in comparison to normal (p value=0.01) and squamous cell carcinoma (p value=0.02) tissues.

"Markers of angiogenesis in high-risk, early-stage cervical cancer: A Gynecologic Oncology Group study.",Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2008-12-24,"To determine whether markers of tumor angiogenesis were associated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in women with high-risk, early-stage cervical cancer treated on a phase III trial. One hundred seventy-three tumor specimens were analyzed by semi-quantitative immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, pro-angiogenesis factor), thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1, anti-angiogenesis factor), CD31 (non-specific endothelial marker), and CD105 (tumor-specific endothelial marker). Tumoral histoscores (HS) were calculated for VEGF using the formula: [% cells positivex(intensity+1)]. TSP-1 specimens were categorized as negative or positive. CD31 and CD105 microvessel density (MVD) ""hotspots"" were counted in three 20x high-power fields. Associations between angiogenesis markers and survival were evaluated. TSP-1 expression was observed in 65% of cases while 66% expressed high VEGF (>or=200), 34% exhibited high CD31 (CD31>or=110) and 66% displayed high CD105 (CD105>or=28). In univariate analyses CD31 MVD, but not tumor TSP-1, was associated with improved PFS (HR=0.37; 95% CI=0.18-0.76; p=0.007) and OS (HR=0.37; 95% CI=0.17-0.79; p=0.010). After adjusting for prognostic clinical covariates, high CD31 MVD, but not TSP-1, VEGF or CD105 MVD, was an independent prognostic factor for PFS (HR=0.36; 95% CI=0.17-0.75; p=0.006) and OS (HR=0.36; 95% CI=0.17-0.79; p=0.010). Tumor angiogenesis measured by CD31 MVD is an independent prognostic factor for both PFS and OS in high-risk, early-stage cervical cancer. We hypothesize that this finding may be explained by improved treatment response in well-vascularized, well-oxygenated tumors.","Clinical Trial, Phase III",4045.0,59.0,To determine whether markers of tumor angiogenesis were associated with progression-free survival PFS and overall survival OS in women with high-risk early-stage cancer treated on a phase III trial One hundred seventy-three tumor specimens were analyzed by semi-quantitative immunohistochemical IHC staining for vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF pro-angiogenesis factor thrombospondin-1 TSP-1 anti-angiogenesis factor CD31 non-specific endothelial marker and CD105 tumor-specific endothelial marker Tumoral histoscores HS were calculated for VEGF using the formula cells positivex intensity+1 TSP-1 specimens were categorized as negative or positive CD31 and CD105 microvessel density MVD `` hotspots '' were counted in three 20x high-power fields Associations between angiogenesis markers and survival were evaluated TSP-1 expression was observed in 65 of cases while 66 expressed high VEGF or=200 34 exhibited high CD31 CD31 or=110 and 66 displayed high CD105 CD105 or=28 In univariate analyses CD31 MVD but not tumor TSP-1 was associated with improved PFS HR=0.37 95 CI=0.18-0.76 p=0.007 and OS HR=0.37 95 CI=0.17-0.79 p=0.010 After adjusting for prognostic clinical covariates high CD31 MVD but not TSP-1 VEGF or CD105 MVD was an independent prognostic factor for PFS HR=0.36 95 CI=0.17-0.75 p=0.006 and OS HR=0.36 95 CI=0.17-0.79 p=0.010 Tumor angiogenesis measured by CD31 MVD is an independent prognostic factor for both PFS and OS in high-risk early-stage cancer We hypothesize that this finding may be explained by improved treatment response in well-vascularized well-oxygenated tumors,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[6, 223, 317, 525, 1, 30, 1056, 11, 41, 5, 91, 115, 25, 300, 2, 63, 25, 118, 4, 117, 5, 64, 43, 191, 82, 12, 73, 23, 8, 124, 316, 160, 104, 1128, 2073, 169, 30, 623, 11, 311, 20, 6399, 1156, 1382, 1289, 1029, 9, 756, 845, 129, 161, 618, 1805, 1056, 161, 12596, 14, 9545, 14, 312, 1056, 161, 6019, 220, 112, 845, 952, 2, 11822, 30, 112, 845, 952, 4204, 57600, 5871, 11, 981, 9, 618, 75, 3, 7986, 37, 57601, 837, 14, 9545, 14, 623, 11, 2320, 22, 199, 15, 109, 6019, 2, 11822, 4269, 1263, 6066, 11193, 522, 11, 12252, 4, 169, 45385, 64, 2349, 3130, 685, 59, 1056, 525, 2, 25, 11, 194, 9545, 14, 55, 10, 164, 4, 556, 1, 140, 369, 700, 570, 64, 618, 15, 1250, 562, 1416, 64, 6019, 6019, 15, 3129, 2, 700, 2507, 64, 11822, 11822, 15, 339, 4, 880, 318, 6019, 6066, 84, 44, 30, 9545, 14, 10, 41, 5, 231, 300, 168, 13, 567, 48, 58, 13, 203, 13, 846, 19, 13, 1999, 2, 118, 168, 13, 567, 48, 58, 13, 269, 13, 842, 19, 13, 4873, 50, 1358, 9, 177, 38, 2489, 64, 6019, 6066, 84, 44, 9545, 14, 618, 15, 11822, 6066, 10, 35, 306, 177, 161, 9, 300, 168, 13, 511, 48, 58, 13, 269, 13, 481, 19, 13, 1861, 2, 118, 168, 13, 511, 48, 58, 13, 269, 13, 842, 19, 13, 4873, 30, 1056, 644, 20, 6019, 6066, 16, 35, 306, 177, 161, 9, 110, 300, 2, 118, 4, 64, 43, 191, 82, 12, 21, 4919, 17, 26, 1567, 68, 40, 3672, 20, 231, 24, 51, 4, 149, 12266, 149, 31182, 57]",1601.0,19110305,773
Human papillomavirus cofactors by disease progression and human papillomavirus types in the study to understand cervical cancer early endpoints and determinants.,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev.,2009-01-01,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) cofactors for cervical cancer include smoking, multiparity, and oral contraceptive use, but their mechanisms of action are not fully understood. It is also unknown whether cofactors vary by HPV genotypes. The Study to Understand Cervical Cancer Early Endpoints and Determinants (SUCCEED) is a cross-sectional study comprising women referred to the University of Oklahoma from November 2003 to September 2007 for abnormal cervical screening results. Detailed questionnaire data and liquid cytology specimens were collected and the latter was genotyped for HPV using the LINEAR ARRAY HPV Genotyping Test. The present analysis includes women with both questionnaire and HPV data and diagnosed with <CIN1 (n = 535), CIN1 (n = 497), CIN2 (n = 336), CIN3 (n = 292), and cancer (n = 80). We evaluated HPV types and cofactors among HPV-infected women by calculating odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for CIN3 and CIN2 separately compared with <CIN2 using a polytomous logistic regression model; cancers were excluded from further analysis due to the substantially higher ages of these women. We found that HPV-infected women with minor histologic or cytologic abnormalities (e.g., CIN1, ASCUS, and LSIL) were indistinguishable from those with normal histology/cytology and were thus combined to form the referent group (<CIN2). Among women positive for oncogenic HPV, current smokers had a 2.5-fold increased risk for CIN3 (95% CI, 1.8-3.6) compared with nonsmokers.

Abdominal radical trachelectomy: Success and pitfalls in a general gynecologic oncology practice.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2009-01-07,"To report our successes and complications with a series of abdominal radical trachelectomies performed to preserve fertility in young women at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Institutional review board (IRB) permission was obtained for retrospective record review. Data were collected regarding patient age and parity, tumor stage and histology, surgical time and complications, post-operative complications, follow-up, and pregnancy. Ten patients underwent radical abdominal trachelectomy, 9 by the same surgeon (LD). Surgery was essentially identical to that of radical hysterectomy with the exception of re-anastomosis of the uterine fundus to the vagina and placement of cerclage. Pre-operative evaluation and post operative follow-up was for the most part identical for all patients. Two patients achieved pregnancy, with 1 twin delivery and 1 patient had 2 pregnancies. Two patients experienced cervical stenosis with regular menses and the same 2 patients passed their abdominal cerclage vaginally. To date there have been no cancer recurrences. Pap smear follow-up has been complicated by difficulty in reading smears from the lower uterine segment (LUS). Radical abdominal trachelectomy can be successfully performed by any gynecologic oncologist who is trained in radical pelvic surgery.

Phase II trial of bevacizumab in the treatment of persistent or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix: a gynecologic oncology group study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-01-12,"Vascular endothelial growth factor is a key promoter of tumor progression in cervical carcinoma. The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) conducted a phase II trial to assess the efficacy and tolerability of bevacizumab, a recombinant humanized anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody. Eligible patients had recurrent cervical cancer, measurable disease, and GOG performance status < or = 2. Treatment consisted of bevacizumab 15 mg/kg intravenously every 21 days until disease progression or prohibitive toxicity. Primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months and toxicity. Forty-six patients were enrolled (median age, 46 years); 38 patients (82.6%) received prior radiation as well as either one (n = 34, 73.9%) or two (n = 12, 26.1%) prior cytotoxic regimens for recurrent disease. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events at least possibly related to bevacizumab included hypertension (n = 7), thrombo-embolism (n = 5), GI (n = 4), anemia (n = 2), other cardiovascular (n = 2), vaginal bleeding (n = 1), neutropenia (n = 1), and fistula (n = 1). One grade 5 infection was observed. Eleven patients (23.9%; two-sided 90% CI, 14% to 37%) survived progression free for at least 6 months, and five patients (10.9%; two-sided 90% CI, 4% to 22%) had partial responses. The median response duration was 6.21 months (range, 2.83 to 8.28 months). The median PFS and overall survival times were 3.40 months (95% CI, 2.53 to 4.53 months) and 7.29 months (95% CI, 6.11 to 10.41 months), respectively. This compared favorably with historical phase II GOG trials in this setting.

The role of lymphadenectomy in the management of preoperative grade 1 endometrial carcinoma.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2009-01-13,"We sought to assess the accuracy of a preoperative grade 1 designation and role of lymphadenectomy in women with preoperative grade 1 endometrial cancer. A retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with preoperative grade 1 endometrial cancer from 1970 to 2006 was conducted. Inclusion criteria were preoperative grade 1 disease and hysterectomy with or without surgical staging. 581 patients who underwent surgery for preoperative grade 1 cancer were identified. Lymphadenectomy was performed in 46%. Pelvic and aortic node metastases were identified in 5.4% and 3.2% patients who underwent lymphadenectomy. 9.7% were upgraded intraoperatively and 25% were upgraded on final pathology with 22% having grade 2 and 3% grade 3 disease. 22.5% with grade 1 disease intraoperatively were upgraded on final pathology, with 21.1% having grade 2 and 1.4% grade 3 disease. 9% had advanced stage disease. 20% of patients with disease limited to the uterus had adverse features including high risk histologic variants, grade 3 disease, myometrial invasion >1/2, and/or cervical involvement.

The expression of heparanase protein in 70 cases of nasopharyngeal carcinomas and 10 cases of normal nasopharyngeal tissues was detected by immunohistochemical staining. The date of expression combined clinical features, which included clinical stage, cervical lymph node metastasis rate, the rate of metastasis and recurrence, combination of, the 5-year survival rate, and other analysis, was analyzed. The positive rate of heparanase protein in cancerous tissues was 52.9% (37/70), while it was 0% in normal nasopharyngeal tissues. The positive rates of heparanase protein in patients were 30.0% (6/20) in stage I, 45.80% (11/24) in stage II, 70.6% (12/17) in stage III, 88.9% (8/9) in stage IV respectively. Heparanase positive tumors were associated with a higher incidence of lymph node metastasis (67.4%, 31/46) than heparanase negative ones (25.0%, 6/24). The rate of distant metastasis and regional recurrence in the heparanase positive group was 48.6% (18/37), but only 15.2% (5/ 33) in the heparanase negative group. The cumulative survival of patients in the heparanase negative group at 5 years was 78.8% (26/33), but only 24.3% (9/37) in the heparanase positive group. The clinical stage of disease, lymph node metastasis, the rate of distant metastasis and regional recurrence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma were correlated with positive expression of heparanase protein. The expression of HPA was associated with invasion and metastasis and prognosis of nasopharyngeal cancer, and it may be a new target for the anti-treatment of nasopharyngeal cancer. (P < 0.01), and heparanase expression level inversely correlated with the patient survival (P < 0.01).

Evaluation of intervention to prevent hypomagnesemia in cervical cancer patients receiving combination cisplatin and radiation treatment.,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,Support Care Cancer,2009-01-27,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of increasing the magnesium (Mg(2+)) supplementation in the pre- and posthydration of patients receiving cisplatin plus radiation (CisXRT) to prevent chemotherapy-induced hypomagnesemia (CIH) events. The study was conducted on newly diagnosed cervical cancer patients receiving CisXRT. The first prospective intervention to prevent CIH was to increase the pre- and posthydration Mg(2+) from 1 to 2 g. After completion of the first intervention, the analysis demonstrated the persistent occurrence of CIH on cycle 3, and later, a second intervention was implemented to increase Mg(2+) to 3 g in the pre- and posthydration. Patients that failed to complete at least five cycles or received cisplatin in combination with another chemotherapy regimen were excluded from the study. Baseline group included 70 patients that had received CisXRT prior to any changes in magnesium supplementation.

Sentinel lymph node mapping for grade 1 endometrial cancer: is it the answer to the surgical staging dilemma?,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2009-02-20,"To describe the accuracy of SLN mapping in patients with a preoperative diagnosis of grade 1 endometrial cancer. A prospective, non-randomized study of women with a preoperative diagnosis of endometrial cancer and clinical stage I disease was conducted. A subset analysis of patients with a preoperative diagnosis of grade 1 endometrial endometrioid cancer was performed. All patients had preoperative lymphoscintigraphy with Tc99m on the day of or day before surgery followed by an intraoperative injection of 2 cm(3) of isosulfan or methylene blue dye deep into the cervix or both cervix and fundus. All patients underwent hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and regional nodal dissection. Hot and/or blue nodes were labeled as SLNs and sent for histopathological analysis. Forty-two patients with a preoperative diagnosis of grade 1 endometrial carcinoma treated from 3/06 to 8/08 were identified. Twenty-five (60%) had laparoscopic surgery; 17 (40%) were treated by laparotomy. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy visualized SLNs in 30 patients (71%); intraoperative localization of the SLN was possible in 36 patients (86%). A median of 3 SLNs (range, 1-14) and 14.5 non-SLNs (range, 4-55) were examined. In all, 4/36 (11%) had positive SLNs-3 seen on H&E and 1 as cytokeratin-positive cells on IHC.

Clinical and pathologic prognostic features in acinic cell carcinoma of the parotid gland.,Cancer,Cancer,2009-05-01,"To the authors' knowledge, the indications for adjuvant treatment in acinic cell carcinoma (AciCC) of the parotid gland have not been elucidated to date. The aim of the current study was to determine patterns of failure and adverse prognostic features. Between March of 1989 and August of 2006, 35 patients underwent surgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center for AciCC of the parotid gland and had their clinical and pathologic features retrospectively analyzed at the primary site. All cases were reviewed by 2 head and neck pathologists. Five-year estimates of survival outcomes were performed, followed by univariate analysis of potential prognostic features. The T classifications were as follows: T1 in 46% of patients, T2 in 23% of patients, T3 in 18% of patients, and T4 in 9% of patients. Three patients had cervical lymph node involvement. All patients underwent surgery as their primary treatment. Approximately 63% of patients (n = 22) received radiation treatment. The median follow-up time for surviving patients was 59.9 months. Five-year estimates of disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and local control were 85%, 90%, and 90%, respectively. Of the clinical variables tested, clinical extracapsular extension (ECE), facial nerve sacrifice, and lymph node involvement were found to be significantly associated with a detriment in DFS and OS (P < .05). Positive surgical margins, histologic ECE, >2 mitoses per 10 high-power fields (HPF), atypical mitosis, vascular invasion, perineural invasion, pleomorphism, and necrosis were associated with adverse DFS (P < .05). All of these variables except for vascular invasion (P = .377) and perineural invasion (P = .07) were associated with OS. If high-grade tumors were defined on the basis of high mitotic activity (>2 mitoses/10 HPF) and/or tumor necrosis, high-grade carcinomas had a significantly lower DFS and OS (P = .001). AciCC had a low treatment failure rate, and a large number of patients could be considered candidates for surgery only. A histologic grading system was devised to help stratify patients for adjuvant treatment.",Journal Article,3917.0,55.0,To the authors knowledge the indications for adjuvant treatment in acinic cell carcinoma AciCC of the parotid gland have not been elucidated to date The aim of the current study was to determine patterns of failure and adverse prognostic features Between March of 1989 and August of 2006 35 patients underwent surgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center for AciCC of the parotid gland and had their clinical and pathologic features retrospectively analyzed at the primary site All cases were reviewed by 2 head and pathologists Five-year estimates of survival outcomes were performed followed by univariate analysis of potential prognostic features The T classifications were as follows T1 in 46 of patients T2 in 23 of patients T3 in 18 of patients and T4 in 9 of patients Three patients had lymph node involvement All patients underwent surgery as their primary treatment Approximately 63 of patients n 22 received radiation treatment The median follow-up time for surviving patients was 59.9 months Five-year estimates of disease-free survival DFS overall survival OS and local control were 85 90 and 90 respectively Of the clinical variables tested clinical extracapsular extension ECE facial nerve sacrifice and lymph node involvement were found to be significantly associated with a detriment in DFS and OS P .05 Positive surgical margins histologic ECE 2 mitoses per 10 high-power fields HPF atypical mitosis vascular invasion perineural invasion pleomorphism and necrosis were associated with adverse DFS P .05 All of these variables except for vascular invasion P .377 and perineural invasion P .07 were associated with OS If high-grade tumors were defined on the basis of high mitotic activity 2 mitoses/10 HPF and/or tumor necrosis high-grade carcinomas had a significantly lower DFS and OS P .001 AciCC had a low treatment failure rate and a large number of patients could be considered candidates for surgery only A histologic grading system was devised to help stratify patients for adjuvant treatment,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[6, 3, 738, 922, 3, 2406, 9, 249, 24, 4, 17375, 31, 134, 34657, 1, 3, 5838, 2326, 47, 44, 85, 3901, 6, 1244, 3, 1130, 1, 3, 291, 45, 10, 6, 223, 764, 1, 496, 2, 290, 177, 404, 59, 2363, 1, 3965, 2, 2480, 1, 1324, 465, 7, 208, 152, 28, 2563, 2783, 2784, 12, 574, 9, 34657, 1, 3, 5838, 2326, 2, 42, 136, 38, 2, 510, 404, 894, 311, 28, 3, 86, 606, 62, 140, 11, 446, 20, 18, 718, 2, 3354, 365, 111, 1423, 1, 25, 123, 11, 173, 370, 20, 880, 65, 1, 174, 177, 404, 3, 102, 5787, 11, 22, 2962, 1534, 4, 641, 1, 7, 1786, 4, 382, 1, 7, 2065, 4, 203, 1, 7, 2, 2463, 4, 83, 1, 7, 169, 7, 42, 263, 289, 799, 62, 7, 208, 152, 22, 136, 86, 24, 705, 676, 1, 7, 78, 350, 103, 121, 24, 3, 52, 166, 126, 98, 9, 3050, 7, 10, 728, 83, 53, 365, 111, 1423, 1, 34, 115, 25, 1010, 63, 25, 118, 2, 293, 182, 11, 772, 424, 2, 424, 106, 1, 3, 38, 682, 650, 38, 5607, 2401, 6508, 6825, 2476, 16670, 2, 263, 289, 799, 11, 204, 6, 40, 97, 41, 5, 8, 13334, 4, 1010, 2, 118, 19, 474, 109, 221, 1012, 884, 6508, 18, 7246, 379, 79, 64, 2349, 3130, 10457, 1973, 5624, 756, 578, 4917, 578, 14152, 2, 1523, 11, 41, 5, 290, 1010, 19, 474, 62, 1, 46, 682, 2187, 9, 756, 578, 19, 8211, 2, 4917, 578, 19, 1615, 11, 41, 5, 118, 492, 64, 88, 57, 11, 395, 23, 3, 877, 1, 64, 2346, 128, 18, 7246, 79, 10457, 2, 15, 30, 1523, 64, 88, 826, 42, 8, 97, 280, 1010, 2, 118, 19, 144, 34657, 42, 8, 154, 24, 496, 116, 2, 8, 375, 207, 1, 7, 359, 40, 515, 1931, 9, 152, 158, 8, 884, 3452, 398, 10, 10085, 6, 987, 3570, 7, 9, 249, 24]",2021.0,19309749,750
Recent achievements and future developments in advanced and recurrent cervical cancer: trials of the Gynecologic Oncology Group.,Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2009-04-01,"Following publication of five pivotal randomized trials of concurrent chemo-irradiation for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (ie, International Federation of Gynecology and Oncology (FIGO] stages IB2-IVA) in 1999 and 2000, the National Cancer Institute issued a Clinical Alert advising that concurrent chemotherapy (typically, single-agent cisplatin) be incorporated into the treatment program of women scheduled to receive definitive pelvic radiotherapy. Although the adoption of this new standard has improved overall survival and decreased the recurrence rate by 50%, for those patients who do relapse, the prognosis is very poor and, ultimately, therapy in this setting is palliative in nature. The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) has now completed eight randomized trials for metastatic and recurrent cervical cancer, all of which have studied cisplatin-based regimens. The eighth trial (protocol 204) compared four cisplatin-based doublets containing paclitaxel, topotecan, vinorelbine, or gemcitabine. Because the vast majority of patients are now expected to receive cisplatin ""up front"" as part of primary therapy with pelvic radiation, there are concerns for the development of drug-resistant clones in recurrences both inside and outside of the radiation field. The GOG has recently reported the results from a phase II trial evaluating the anti-vascular agent, bevacizumab, in women who were eligible for second-line or third-line therapy for metastatic and/or recurrent disease (protocol 227C).

Somatic LKB1 mutations promote cervical cancer progression.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2009-04-02,"Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is the etiologic agent for cervical cancer. Yet, infection with HPV is not sufficient to cause cervical cancer, because most infected women develop transient epithelial dysplasias that spontaneously regress. Progression to invasive cancer has been attributed to diverse host factors such as immune or hormonal status, as no recurrent genetic alterations have been identified in cervical cancers. Thus, the pressing question as to the biological basis of cervical cancer progression has remained unresolved, hampering the development of novel therapies and prognostic tests. Here we show that at least 20% of cervical cancers harbor somatically-acquired mutations in the LKB1 tumor suppressor. Approximately one-half of tumors with mutations harbored single nucleotide substitutions or microdeletions identifiable by exon sequencing, while the other half harbored larger monoallelic or biallelic deletions detectable by multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA). Biallelic mutations were identified in most cervical cancer cell lines; HeLa, the first human cell line, harbors a homozygous 25 kb deletion that occurred in vivo. LKB1 inactivation in primary tumors was associated with accelerated disease progression.

We present the technique and outcome for a fertility-sparing, radical abdominal trachelectomy in a 12-year-old girl with anaplastic, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma involving the uterine cervix. The patient had presented to our center after the piecemeal resection of a uterine cervical mass; because of concern about microscopic residual disease, we classified her as group II-A according to the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study system. Staging studies excluded the presence of distant disease. The patient received 4 cycles of multiagent chemotherapy and then underwent radical abdominal trachelectomy, with removal of the uterine cervix, parametria, vaginal cuff, and regional lymph nodes. Microscopically, the specimen showed treatment effect and no residual tumor. Regional nodes were negative. Radical abdominal trachelectomy, which has not been previously reported for rhabdomyosarcoma, has appeared to secure local disease control in this case while preserving the patient's future fertility potential.

A prognostic index for predicting lymph node metastasis in minor salivary gland cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2010-01-01,"Large studies examining the clinical and pathological factors associated with nodal metastasis in minor salivary gland cancer are lacking in the literature. Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we identified 2,667 minor salivary gland cancers with known lymph node status from 1988 to 2004. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with the use of neck dissection, the use of external beam radiation therapy, and the presence of cervical lymph node metastases. Four hundred twenty-six (16.0%) patients had neck nodal involvement. Factors associated with neck nodal involvement on univariate analysis included increasing age, male sex, increasing tumor size, high tumor grade, T3-T4 stage, adenocarcinoma or mucoepidermoid carcinomas, and pharyngeal site of primary malignancy. On multivariate analysis, four statistically significant factors were identified, including male sex, T3-T4 stage, pharyngeal site of primary malignancy, and high-grade adenocarcinoma or high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinomas. The proportions (and 95% confidence intervals) of patients with lymph node involvement for those with 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 of these prognostic factors were 0.02 (0.01-0.03), 0.09 (0.07-0.11), 0.17 (0.14-0.21), 0.41 (0.33-0.49), and 0.70 (0.54-0.85), respectively. Grade was a significant predictor of metastasis for adenocarcinoma and mucoepidermoid carcinoma but not for adenoid cystic carcinoma.

Anaplastic thyroid cancer manifesting as new-onset Horner syndrome.,Endocrine practice : official journal of the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists,Endocr Pract,,"To report a case of Horner syndrome as the initial sign of locally advanced anaplastic thyroid cancer. We present a case report in conjunction with a retrospective review and evaluation of the English-language literature on Horner syndrome and thyroid pathologic conditions. Horner syndrome is a rare complication of thyroid disease most often occurring in the postoperative setting after resections. Preoperatively, Horner syndrome is usually caused by a benign intrathoracic goiter that compresses the sympathetic plexus as it exits the thoracic cavity to enter the neck. Malignant thyroid disease leading to Horner syndrome is less common than benign causes of the syndrome. Treatment of compressive lesions can lead to resolution of nerve compression. Horner syndrome is a rare complication of thyroid pathologic conditions. When present preoperatively, the majority of cases are due to benign compression of the cervical plexus. Therefore, Horner syndrome in the setting of a goiter does not necessarily portend a malignant process as one might suspect. Nonetheless, it still remains important that those patients who present with Horner syndrome undergo appropriate assessment for detection of mass lesions, underlying vascular etiologic factors, or other potentially treatable disorders causing sympathetic chain dysfunction.",Case Reports,,9.0,To report a case of Horner syndrome as the initial sign of locally advanced anaplastic cancer We present a case report in conjunction with a retrospective review and evaluation of the English-language literature on Horner syndrome and pathologic conditions Horner syndrome is a rare complication of disease most often occurring in the postoperative setting after resections Preoperatively Horner syndrome is usually caused by a benign intrathoracic goiter that compresses the sympathetic plexus as it exits the thoracic cavity to enter the Malignant disease leading to Horner syndrome is less common than benign causes of the syndrome Treatment of compressive lesions can lead to resolution of nerve compression Horner syndrome is a rare complication of pathologic conditions When present preoperatively the majority of cases are due to benign compression of the plexus Therefore Horner syndrome in the setting of a goiter does not necessarily portend a malignant process as one might suspect Nonetheless it still remains important that those patients who present with Horner syndrome undergo appropriate assessment for detection of mass lesions underlying vascular etiologic factors or other potentially treatable disorders causing sympathetic chain dysfunction,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,"[6, 414, 8, 473, 1, 23771, 681, 22, 3, 388, 7636, 1, 795, 131, 1841, 12, 21, 364, 8, 473, 414, 4, 3357, 5, 8, 459, 206, 2, 451, 1, 3, 4201, 4794, 789, 23, 23771, 681, 2, 510, 1298, 23771, 681, 16, 8, 622, 1447, 1, 34, 96, 629, 1821, 4, 3, 573, 546, 50, 2185, 3888, 23771, 681, 16, 2082, 1546, 20, 8, 1002, 7359, 16309, 17, 57939, 3, 11277, 9576, 22, 192, 45567, 3, 2098, 2405, 6, 7058, 3, 393, 34, 1049, 6, 23771, 681, 16, 299, 186, 76, 1002, 1626, 1, 3, 681, 24, 1, 33928, 406, 122, 1122, 6, 2125, 1, 2476, 3481, 23771, 681, 16, 8, 622, 1447, 1, 510, 1298, 198, 364, 3888, 3, 686, 1, 140, 32, 520, 6, 1002, 3481, 1, 3, 9576, 673, 23771, 681, 4, 3, 546, 1, 8, 16309, 1097, 44, 7766, 11293, 8, 393, 1129, 22, 104, 822, 17657, 4648, 192, 1234, 469, 305, 17, 135, 7, 54, 364, 5, 23771, 681, 1251, 870, 455, 9, 638, 1, 782, 406, 1181, 756, 6604, 130, 15, 127, 751, 9437, 1997, 3440, 11277, 1260, 1527]",1262.0,19491063,89
Cancer prevention: from 1727 to milestones of the past 100 years.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2009-06-02,"The rich, multidisciplinary history of cancer prevention recounted here begins with surgical and workplace recommendations of the 1700s and ends with 2009 results of the enormous (35,535 men) Selenium and Vitamin E [prostate] Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT). This history comprises a fascinating array of chemopreventive, vaccine, surgical, and behavioral science research, both preclinical and clinical. Preclinical milestones of cancer prevention include the 1913 and 1916 mouse studies by Lathrop and Loeb of cancer development associated with pregnancy or cancer prevention through castration (oophorectomy), preventing chemically induced mouse carcinogenesis as early as 1929, energy restriction studies in the 1940s, the 1950s discoveries and later molecular characterizations of field cancerization and multistep carcinogenesis, and the effects of angiogenesis inhibition in genetically engineered mice reported in 2009. The extraordinary panoply of clinical research includes numerous large and smaller chemoprevention studies of nutritional supplements, other dietary approaches, a Bacillus Calmette-Guérin trial in 1976, molecular-targeted agents, and agents to prevent infection-related cancers such as hepatitis B virus vaccine to prevent liver cancer in 1984. Clinical surgical prevention includes removal of intraepithelial neoplasia detected by screening (including Pap testing developed in 1929 and culposcopy for cervical premalignancy and colonoscopy and polypectomy to prevent colorectal cancer begun in the 1960s) and prophylactic surgeries, such as in Lynch syndrome patients begun in 1977. Behavioral studies include smoking cessation and control beginning in the 1950s, obesity control rooted in studies of 1841, and genetic-counseling and cancer-survivorship studies.

Parametrial involvement in radical hysterectomy specimens for women with early-stage cervical cancer.,Obstetrics and gynecology,Obstet Gynecol,2009-07-01,"To estimate the incidence of parametrial involvement and to evaluate factors associated with parametrial spread in women with early-stage cervical cancer and to identify a cohort of patients at low risk for parametrial spread who may benefit from less radical surgery. We reviewed all patients who underwent radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy for invasive cervical cancer between 1990 and 2006. All women with squamous, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous disease, stage IA2-IB1, who underwent completed radical hysterectomy were included in the analysis. Normally distributed continuous variables were compared using Student's t-test for independent samples to analyze the outcome of positive or negative parametrial involvement. Three hundred fifty patients met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 27 women (7.7%) had parametrial involvement. The majority of specimens with parametrial involvement (52%) had tumor spread through direct microscopic extension. Patients with parametrial involvement were more likely to have a primary tumor size larger than 2 cm (larger than 2 cm: 14%, smaller than 2 cm: 4%, P=.001), higher histologic grade (grade 3: 12%, grades 1 and 2: 3%, P=.01), lymphovascular space invasion (positive: 12%, negative: 3%, P=.002), and metastasis to the pelvic lymph nodes (positive: 31%, negative: 4%, P<.001). One hundred twenty-five women (36%) had squamous, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous lesions, all grades, with primary tumor size 2 cm or smaller and no lymphovascular space invasion. In this group of patients, there was no pathologic evidence of parametrial involvement. We were able to retrospectively identify a cohort of women with early-stage cervical cancer who were at very low risk for parametrial involvement. If prospective application of these findings confirms our results, less radical surgery-such as simple hysterectomy, simple trachelectomy, or conization-with pelvic lymphadenectomy may be a reasonable therapeutic option for women with primary tumors 2 cm or smaller and no lymphovascular space invasion.

Targeted in vivo imaging of integrin alphavbeta6 with an improved radiotracer and its relevance in a pancreatic tumor model.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2009-06-23,"The cell surface receptor alpha(v)beta(6) is epithelial specific, and its expression is tightly regulated; it is low or undetectable in adult tissues but has been shown to be increased in many different cancers, including pancreatic, cervical, lung, and colon cancers. Studies have described alpha(v)beta(6) as a prognostic biomarker linked to poor survival. We have recently shown the feasibility of imaging alpha(v)beta(6) in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET) using the peptide [(18)F]FBA-A20FMDV2. Here, we describe improved alpha(v)beta(6) imaging agents and test their efficacy in a mouse model with endogenous alpha(v)beta(6) expression. The modified compounds maintained high affinity for alpha(v)beta(6) and >1,000-fold selectivity over related integrins (by ELISA) and showed significantly improved alpha(v)beta(6)-dependent binding in cell-based assays (>60% binding versus <10% for [(18)F]FBA-A20FMDV2). In vivo studies using either a melanoma cell line (transduced alpha(v)beta(6) expression) or the BxPC-3 human pancreatic carcinoma cell line (endogenous alpha(v)beta(6) expression) revealed that the modified compounds showed significantly improved tumor retention. This, along with good clearance of nonspecifically bound activity, particularly for the new radiotracer [(18)F]FBA-PEG(28)-A20FMDV2, resulted in improved PET imaging. Tumor/pancreas and tumor/blood biodistribution ratios of >23:1 and >47:1, respectively, were achieved at 4 hours.

Limiting the morbidity of inguinal lymphadenectomy for metastatic melanoma.,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,Cancer Control,2009-07-01,"Surgery is currently the primary treatment modality for metastatic melanoma involving the inguinal lymph nodes. However, inguinal lymph node dissections are associated with substantial morbidity including infection, wound dehiscence, lymphedema, seroma, and deep venous thromboembolism (DVT). Improved understanding is needed regarding the factors predisposing patients to complications and the operative and perioperative maneuvers that can decrease morbidity. We reviewed recently published literature regarding the morbidity associated with lymphadenectomy in the treatment of inguinal metastatic melanoma. Where available, emphasis was focused on appropriately designed studies aimed at reducing treatment-related morbidity. When appropriate, the review was supplemented by our personal experience. Strategies to limit treatment-related morbidity involve optimizing the preoperative assessment, operative technique, and postoperative care. Establishing the diagnosis of nodal metastasis early using minimally invasive techniques is critical to reduce subsequent perioperative complications. Morbidity is higher for inguinal compared to cervical or axillary lymphadenectomy, and many variations in extent of inguinal lymphadenectomy and operative technique have been reported. The lack of definitive trials has led to controversy regarding surgical technique such as indications for pelvic lymphadenectomy (""deep"" node dissection), saphenous vein preservation, and sartorius transposition. In the postoperative period, the use of DVT and lymphedema prophylaxis should be considered to potentially improve patient outcomes. While the morbidity of inguinal lymphadenectomy can be substantial, several straightforward pre- and postoperative measures can be instituted to limit morbidity. Controversy persists regarding the indications for and benefit of pelvic lymphadenectomy, saphenous vein preservation, and sartorius muscle transposition.

Patterns of regional recurrence after definitive radiotherapy for cervical cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol.

The records of 198 patients treated with definitive RT for cervical cancer between 1980 and 2000 who experienced a regional recurrence without a central or distal vaginal recurrence were reviewed. All patients received a combination of external-beam RT and intracavitary brachytherapy. In the 180 patients with a documented location of regional recurrence, the relationship between the recurrence and the radiation fields was determined. The median time to regional recurrence was 13 months (range, 2-85 months). Of the 180 patients who had an evaluable regional recurrence, 119 (66%) had a component of marginal failure; 71 patients recurred above-the-field, 2 patients occurred in the inguinal nodes, and 2 patients recurred above-the-field and in the inguinal nodes. In addition, 105 patients (58%) had a component of in-field failure; 59 patients recurred in-field only, 39 patients recurred in-field and above-the-field, 2 patients recurred in-field, above-the-field, and in the inguinal nodes, and 5 patients recurred in-field and in the inguinal nodes. The median survival after regional recurrence was 8 months (range, 0-194 months). Most regional recurrences after definitive RT for cervical cancer include a component of marginal failure, usually immediately superior to the radiation field.

Current understanding of risk factors for ovarian cancer.,Current treatment options in oncology,Curr Treat Options Oncol,2009-07-15,"Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecologic cancer. Unlike many cancers such as breast, cervical and colon cancers, there is no easily clinically identifiable pre-malignant phase of this malignancy making early identification difficult. Similarly, unlike lung, head and neck, and skin cancers, there is not easily identifiable risk factor making prevention short of oophorectomy difficult.

Amplifications of both the 3q26 (TERC) and 8q24 (MYC) loci have been shown to be prevalent in both high-grade lesions and invasive cervical carcinoma. Most of these studies have looked at either the histological sample or at the entire cytological population of cells. We have developed a Papanicolaou (Pap) destaining method that allows for the accurate analysis of individual cells that were previously identified by cytopathology as dysplastic.

Node-positive adenocarcinoma of the endometrium: outcome and patterns of recurrence with and without external beam irradiation.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2009-07-25,"To evaluate treatment outcomes and patterns of recurrence in patients with node-positive (International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology stage IIIC) adenocarcinoma of the uterus without serous or clear cell differentiation. The records of 71 women who were treated for stage IIIC endometrial adenocarcinoma at our institution between 1984 and 2005 were reviewed. All patients underwent total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and lymphadenectomy. Fifty patients received definitive pelvic or extended-field radiotherapy with or without systemic therapy (regional RT group). Eighteen received adjuvant systemic platinum-based chemotherapy or hormonal therapy without external beam RT. The median follow-up for patients not dying of disease was 67 months. Survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method; differences were assessed using log-rank tests. Thirty-nine percent (28/71) of patients had involved paraaortic lymph nodes while 61% (43/71) had only pelvic lymph nodes. Five- and 10-year disease-specific survival (DSS) rates were 63% and 54%, respectively; corresponding overall survival rates were 60% and 47%. Grade was strongly associated with DSS (76% vs 46% at 5 years for low-grade vs high-grade tumors, P=0.004). Cervical or adnexal involvement was associated with decreased DSS, but lymph-vascular space invasion, age, race, body mass index, and number and location of positive nodes were not. Five-year pelvic-relapse-free survival (98% vs 61%, P=0.001), DSS (78% vs 39%, P=0.01), and overall survival (73% vs 40%, P=0.03) were significantly better for the regional RT group than the systemic therapy group. In patients treated without regional RT, the most common site of relapse was the pelvis. DSS was not significantly correlated with number of nodes removed in the regional RT group but was in patients treated without regional RT (P=0.001). Patients treated without regional RT had a high rate of locoregional recurrence. Patients with stage IIIC endometrial adenocarcinoma who underwent surgical staging followed by external beam irradiation had a high rate of cure.

Predictive value of FIGO and AJCC staging systems in patients with uterine leiomyosarcoma.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",Eur. J. Cancer,2009-07-31,"Cancer staging systems aim to identify patient cohorts with different outcomes based on clinically relevant prognostic factors. Uterine leiomyosarcoma (ULMS) is classified using the FIGO staging system developed for epithelial malignancies; other sarcomas use the AJCC staging system. Neither has been validated in ULMS. We critically evaluated both systems to determine if either identified patient groups with distinct outcomes. We staged 230 ULMS patients by the FIGO and AJCC systems. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were calculated; statistical pairwise comparisons were performed. The number of stages I and III patients varied by staging system. There were few stage II patients by either system. Using the FIGO system, PFS was better in stage I patients versus stage III or IV patients, and OS was better in stage I patients versus stage IV patients. Using the AJCC system, PFS and OS were better in stage I patients (low grade) versus stage II, III or IV patients, and OS was better in stage III patients versus stage IV patients. Prognosis of patients with serosal involvement (FIGO III) was similar to that of patients with metastases (FIGO IV). Neither system classifies ULMS patients into four clinically meaningful, non-overlapping stages predictive of PFS and OS. This analysis highlights the relevance of certain factors (low grade, serosal involvement) and rarity of others (FIGO stage II, cervical invasion).

Carbonic anhydrase IX and human papillomavirus as diagnostic biomarkers of cervical dysplasia/neoplasia in women with a cytologic diagnosis of atypical glandular cells: a Gynecologic Oncology Group study in United States.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2009-11-01,"High-risk human papillomavirus (H-HPV) infection is strongly linked to cervical neoplasia, but its role in detecting glandular lesions (GLs) is unclear. In the cervix, carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-IX) is expressed in cervical neoplasia, but rarely in the benign cervix. The diagnostic utility of these biomarkers was evaluated in women with a cytologic diagnosis of atypical glandular cells (AGC). H-HPV was detected using hybrid capture 2 (HC2) in liquid-based cytology, and CA-IX immunoreactivity was studied on conventional Pap smears. Of 403 patients, 111 (28%) were positive for significant cervical lesions (SCLs) including CIN2, CIN3, adenocarcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma. CA-IX testing alone (n = 403) had a sensitivity of 75, 95 or 65% for SCLs, significant GLs or squamous lesions (SLs), respectively, with a specificity of 88% and a false negative rate (FNR defined as 1 minus negative predictive value) of 10%. Testing for H-HPV (n = 122) had a sensitivity of 97, 100 or 96% for SCLs, GLs or SLs, respectively, with a specificity of 87% and a FNR of 1%.

Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration for staging of malignant pleural mesothelioma.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2009-09-01,"Radical surgery for malignant pleural mesothelioma does not improve survival in patients with nodal metastases. Imaging is poor at predicting nodal involvement and mediastinoscopy, though frequently used, is of low sensitivity. As endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and esophageal endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are accurate for nodal staging of lung cancer, we hypothesized that they would be at least as sensitive as cervical video-mediastinoscopy for nodal staging of mesothelioma. Eighty-five patients with mesothelioma who were potential candidates for radical surgery underwent preoperative staging with mediastinoscopy (n = 50) or EBUS (n = 38). Eleven patients also underwent EUS. Diagnostic yield (specimens containing lymphocytes or tumor cells) was 100% for mediastinoscopy and 84% for EBUS (p < 0.001). Mediastinoscopy identified 7 of 50 (14%) patients with nodal metastases. Thirty-eight (76%) mediastinoscopy-negative patients underwent surgery with nodal sampling and there were 18 false negatives. Endobronchial ultrasound identified 13 of 38 (34%) patients with nodal metastases. Twenty-two (58%) EBUS-negative patients underwent surgery with nodal sampling and there were 10 false negatives. Sensitivity and negative predictive value for mediastinoscopy were 28% and 49%, and 59% and 57% for EBUS. Eleven patients had EUS preoperatively, which revealed infradiaphragmatic nodal metastases in 5 patients. Although this study is retrospective, EBUS had higher sensitivity than either mediastinoscopy or imaging studies for detection of nodal metastases. Nevertheless, the ability to accurately identify nodal involvement preoperatively in patients with mesothelioma remains suboptimal. Esophageal ultrasound may complement EBUS particularly in cases where infradiaphragmatic nodal metastases are suspected.",Comparative Study,3794.0,44.0,Radical surgery for malignant pleural does not improve survival in patients with nodal metastases Imaging is poor at predicting nodal involvement and mediastinoscopy though frequently used is of low sensitivity As endobronchial ultrasound EBUS and endoscopic ultrasound EUS are accurate for nodal staging of cancer we hypothesized that they would be at least as sensitive as video-mediastinoscopy for nodal staging of Eighty-five patients with who were potential candidates for radical surgery underwent preoperative staging with mediastinoscopy n 50 or EBUS n 38 Eleven patients also underwent EUS Diagnostic yield specimens containing lymphocytes or tumor cells was 100 for mediastinoscopy and 84 for EBUS p 0.001 Mediastinoscopy identified 7 of 50 14 patients with nodal metastases Thirty-eight 76 mediastinoscopy-negative patients underwent surgery with nodal sampling and there were 18 false negatives Endobronchial ultrasound identified 13 of 38 34 patients with nodal metastases Twenty-two 58 EBUS-negative patients underwent surgery with nodal sampling and there were 10 false negatives Sensitivity and negative predictive value for mediastinoscopy were 28 and 49 and 59 and 57 for EBUS Eleven patients had EUS preoperatively which revealed infradiaphragmatic nodal metastases in 5 patients Although this study is retrospective EBUS had higher sensitivity than either mediastinoscopy or imaging studies for detection of nodal metastases Nevertheless the ability to accurately identify nodal involvement preoperatively in patients with remains suboptimal ultrasound may complement EBUS particularly in cases where infradiaphragmatic nodal metastases are suspected,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,"[711, 152, 9, 393, 2164, 1097, 44, 401, 25, 4, 7, 5, 779, 196, 270, 16, 334, 28, 1434, 779, 799, 2, 9856, 2471, 746, 95, 16, 1, 154, 485, 22, 11087, 1945, 7080, 2, 2056, 1945, 3626, 32, 1481, 9, 779, 632, 1, 12, 21, 1237, 17, 491, 688, 40, 28, 506, 22, 745, 22, 4139, 9856, 9, 779, 632, 1, 2207, 365, 7, 5, 54, 11, 174, 1931, 9, 711, 152, 208, 498, 632, 5, 9856, 78, 212, 15, 7080, 78, 519, 2627, 7, 120, 208, 3626, 752, 2309, 623, 1101, 1594, 15, 30, 37, 10, 394, 9, 9856, 2, 874, 9, 7080, 19, 13, 144, 9856, 108, 67, 1, 212, 213, 7, 5, 779, 196, 977, 659, 846, 9856, 199, 7, 208, 152, 5, 779, 2874, 2, 125, 11, 203, 2133, 13508, 11087, 1945, 108, 233, 1, 519, 562, 7, 5, 779, 196, 737, 100, 717, 7080, 199, 7, 208, 152, 5, 779, 2874, 2, 125, 11, 79, 2133, 13508, 485, 2, 199, 464, 549, 9, 9856, 11, 339, 2, 739, 2, 728, 2, 696, 9, 7080, 2627, 7, 42, 3626, 3888, 92, 553, 30476, 779, 196, 4, 33, 7, 242, 26, 45, 16, 459, 7080, 42, 142, 485, 76, 361, 9856, 15, 270, 94, 9, 638, 1, 779, 196, 3873, 3, 801, 6, 2141, 255, 779, 799, 3888, 4, 7, 5, 469, 3291, 1945, 68, 3731, 7080, 823, 4, 140, 1257, 30476, 779, 196, 32, 2768]",1670.0,19699913,579

Improving sentinel lymph node detection rates in endometrial cancer: how many cases are needed?,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2009-09-19,"To describe sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection rates in endometrial cancer and estimate how many cases are needed to achieve >90% SLN detection. We conducted a prospective study of patients undergoing primary surgery for endometrial cancer between September 2005 and March 2009. Lymph node mapping was performed using blue dye injection into the cervix in all cases. Additional injection methods included blue dye injection in the uterine fundus, and cervical injection of Tc99m. SLNs were identified and removed, followed by regional lymph node dissection. The results were analyzed according to two study periods: an ""early"" phase (September 2005-December 2007) and a ""late"" phase (January 2008-March 2009). One hundred and fifteen patients with endometrial cancer were included. The cervix was the only site of injection in 82 cases (71%), while a combined cervical and fundal injection was performed in 33 cases (29%). Overall, SLN detection was achieved in 98 (85%) cases. In the initial 27 months of the study, a SLN was identified in 50 of 64 cases (78%), with 2 false negative cases. In the subsequent 15 months, successful mapping was achieved in 48 of 51 cases (94%) with no false negative cases.

Prognostic factors for response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in advanced cervical carcinoma: a Gynecologic Oncology Group Study.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2009-10-22,"Cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy is considered standard treatment for advanced/recurrent cervical carcinoma; however, the majority of patients do not respond. This study was undertaken to identify the prognostic factors and develop a model predictive of (non-) response to chemotherapy. Four-hundred twenty-eight patients with advanced cervical cancer who received a cisplatin-containing combination in three Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) protocols (110, 169 and 179) were evaluated for baseline clinical characteristics and multivariate analysis was conducted to identify factors independently prognostic predictive of response using a Logistic regression model. A predictive model was developed and externally validated using an independent GOG protocol (149) data. Multivariate analysis identified five factors (African-American, performance status [PS] >0, pelvic disease, prior radiosensitizer and time interval from diagnosis to first recurrence <1 year) independently prognostic of poor response. A simple prognostic index was derived based on the total number of risk factors. When patients were classified into three risk groups (low risk: 0-1 factor; mid risk: 2-3 factors; high risk: 4-5 factors), patients with 4-5 risk factors were estimated to have a response rate of only 13%, and median progression-free and overall survival of 2.8 months and 5.5 months, respectively. The accuracy of the index was supported by both internal and external datasets. A simple index based on five prognostic factors may have utility in clinical practice to identify the women who are not likely to respond to the cisplatin-containing regimens.

Anti-angiogenesis agents in metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2009-10-27,"While the incidence of cervical cancer has declined significantly in the United States, it still remains a serious American health threat. When detected early, cervical cancer is generally curable. Early lesions are treated surgically, and locally advanced lesions are managed with concurrent cisplatin chemotherapy and pelvic radiation. Metastatic disease or recurrent lesions not amenable to radical local excision or regional radiation are treated with palliative chemotherapy. Current chemotherapeutic regimens are associated with significant side effects and only limited activity making the identification of active and tolerable novel targeted agents a high priority. Angiogenesis is central to cervical cancer development and progression. The dominant role of angiogenesis in cervical cancer seems to be directly related to HPV inhibition of p53 and stabilization of HIF-1 alpha, both of which increase VEGF. Bevacizumab binding and subsequent inactivation of VEGF seem to shrink cervical tumors and delay progression without appreciable toxicity, and are therefore being studied in a Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) phase III trial. Other intracellular tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of angiogenesis such as pazopanib are also encouraging, especially in lieu of their oral administration.

Radical abdominal trachelectomy for stage IB1 cervical cancer at 15-week gestation.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2009-10-29,"The management of stage IB1 cervical cancer at 15 weeks pregnancy remains a significant challenge from both the oncologic and obstetrical standpoints. Abdominal trachelectomy has been recently described as a potential option in patients who have a very strong desire to attempt preservation of pregnancy and treat the cancer without delay. A 37-year-old female, presented for prenatal care in the first trimester and was diagnosed with a FIGO stage IB1 poorly differentiated lymphoepithelioma like cervical cancer on conization. After extensive counseling she underwent a radical abdominal trachelectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy and placement of permanent cerclage at 15 weeks gestation. Final trachelectomy pathology revealed 7/19 mm invasion with no lymphovascular invasion, negative margins and nodes. She successfully carried the pregnancy to 39 weeks gestation and delivered a healthy female infant by elective planned cesarean hysterectomy. The patient remains without evidence of disease at the time of this report. Recent advances in fertility-sparing surgery for stage IB1 cervical cancer lead to the successful utilization of radical abdominal trachelectomy during the early second trimester of pregnancy.

Conference Report: Seventh Annual AACR International Conference on Frontiers in Cancer Prevention Research.,"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",Cancer Prev Res (Phila),2009-11-01,"In November, 2008 the AACR held the Seventh Annual Frontiers in Cancer Prevention Research meeting in Washington, DC. At this meeting, a wide range of cutting-edge cancer prevention research was presented. This summary highlights some of the most impactful presentations with a focus on the interaction between inflammation, infections, the immune system, and tumor microenvironment in promoting cancer. Several of these presentations described targeting host-tumor interactions as a means for cancer prevention. As discussed below, this meeting continues to represent all phases of cancer prevention research including epidemiologic studies, behavioral and lifestyle interventions, carcinogenesis research, preclinical studies testing novel preventive interventions, and the results of early- and late-phase cancer prevention trials. Major advances presented at the 2008 meeting included studies showing that immune cells can be either protumorigenic or antitumorigenic, efforts to develop more comprehensive human papillomavirus vaccines to more effectively prevent cervical cancer and other human papillomavirus-related cancers, controversial studies of vitamin D and cancer risk, and studies of single-nucleotide polymorphisms to better assess cancer risk. These and the other presentations at this meeting continue to provide strong support for the concept that cancer will be most effectively controlled by applying modern cancer prevention strategies.",Congress,3733.0,1.0,In November 2008 the AACR held the Seventh Annual Frontiers in Cancer Prevention Research meeting in Washington DC At this meeting a wide range of cutting-edge cancer prevention research was presented This summary highlights some of the most impactful presentations with a focus on the interaction between inflammation infections the immune system and tumor microenvironment in promoting cancer Several of these presentations described targeting host-tumor interactions as a means for cancer prevention As discussed below this meeting continues to represent all phases of cancer prevention research including epidemiologic studies behavioral and lifestyle interventions carcinogenesis research preclinical studies testing novel preventive interventions and the results of early- and late-phase cancer prevention trials Major advances presented at the 2008 meeting included studies showing that immune cells can be either protumorigenic or antitumorigenic efforts to develop more comprehensive human papillomavirus vaccines to more effectively prevent cancer and other human papillomavirus-related cancers controversial studies of vitamin D and cancer risk and studies of single-nucleotide polymorphisms to better assess cancer risk These and the other presentations at this meeting continue to provide strong support for the concept that cancer will be most effectively controlled by applying modern cancer prevention strategies,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[4, 2868, 1375, 3, 1630, 4033, 3, 8114, 2114, 24656, 4, 12, 1070, 389, 2238, 4, 10840, 2321, 28, 26, 2238, 8, 1019, 184, 1, 13360, 7951, 12, 1070, 389, 10, 917, 26, 1962, 2527, 476, 1, 3, 96, 17993, 4261, 5, 8, 1222, 23, 3, 915, 59, 1815, 1875, 3, 250, 398, 2, 30, 995, 4, 2388, 12, 392, 1, 46, 4261, 1027, 529, 1204, 30, 1286, 22, 8, 2263, 9, 12, 1070, 22, 1588, 2736, 26, 2238, 2274, 6, 1231, 62, 3523, 1, 12, 1070, 389, 141, 3609, 94, 4166, 2, 3487, 1151, 1719, 389, 693, 94, 471, 229, 3494, 1151, 2, 3, 99, 1, 191, 2, 807, 124, 12, 1070, 143, 458, 954, 917, 28, 3, 1375, 2238, 159, 94, 2069, 17, 250, 37, 122, 40, 361, 11840, 15, 15958, 1413, 6, 690, 80, 949, 171, 3242, 1842, 6, 80, 1856, 1682, 12, 2, 127, 171, 3242, 139, 163, 2010, 94, 1, 1610, 427, 2, 12, 43, 2, 94, 1, 226, 1579, 1203, 6, 380, 423, 12, 43, 46, 2, 3, 127, 4261, 28, 26, 2238, 1906, 6, 377, 1082, 538, 9, 3, 2545, 17, 12, 303, 40, 96, 1856, 1149, 20, 4798, 2366, 12, 1070, 422]",1428.0,19892666,277
Dynamic jaws and dynamic couch in helical tomotherapy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2009-11-10,"To investigate the next generation of helical tomotherapy delivery with dynamic jaw and dynamic couch movements. The new technique of dynamic jaw and dynamic couch movements is described, and a comparative planning study is performed. Ten nasopharyngeal cancer patients with skull base infiltration were chosen for this comparison of longitudinal dose profiles using regular tomotherapy delivery, running-start-stop treatment, and dynamic jaw and dynamic couch delivery. A multifocal simultaneous integrated boost concept was used (70.4Gy to the primary tumor and involved lymph nodes; 57.4Gy to the bilateral cervical lymphatic drainage pathways, 32 fractions). Target coverage, conformity, homogeneity, sparing of organs at risk, integral dose, and radiation delivery time were evaluated. Mean parotid dose for all different deliveries was between 24.8 and 26.1Gy, without significant differences. The mean integral dose was lowered by 6.3% by using the dynamic technique, in comparison with a 2.5-cm-field width for regular delivery and 16.7% with 5-cm-field width for regular delivery. Dynamic jaw and couch movements reduced the calculated radiation time by 66% of the time required with regular 2.5-cm-field width delivery (199 sec vs. 595 sec, p < 0.001). The current delivery mode of helical tomotherapy produces dose distributions with conformal avoidance of parotid glands, brain stem, and spinal cord. The new technology with dynamic jaw and couch movements improves the plan quality by reducing the dose penumbra and thereby reducing the integral dose.

"Prognostic relevance of carbonic anhydrase-IX in high-risk, early-stage cervical cancer: a Gynecologic Oncology Group study.",Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2009-11-13,"This study aimed to determine whether carbonic anhydrase-IX (CA-IX) was associated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in women with high-risk, early-stage cervical cancer treated with adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy with or without radiosensitizing chemotherapy. CA-IX expression was detected using an immunohistochemistry assay and categorized as low when <or=80% of tumor cells exhibited CA-IX staining and high when >80% tumor cells display CA-IX staining. Associations between CA-IX expression and clinical characteristics, angiogenesis marker expression, and clinical outcome were evaluated. High CA-IX expression was observed in 35/166 (21.1%) of cases. CA-IX expression was not associated with age, race, stage, cell type, grade, positive margins, parametrial extensions, positive lymph nodes, or lymphovascular space invasion but was associated with tumor size categorized as <2 , 2-2.9 , or >or=3 cm (high expression: 4.7% vs. 23.2% vs. 32.5%, P=0.003) and cervical invasion confined to the inner two-thirds compared with the outer third of the cervix (high expression: 6.1% vs. 23.7%, P=0.028). CA-IX expression was not associated with immunohistochemical expression of p53, CD31, CD105, thrombospondin-1, or vascular endothelial growth factor-A. Women with high versus low CA-IX expression had similar PFS (P=0.053) and significantly worse OS (P=0.044). After adjusting for prognostic clinical covariates, high CA-IX expression was an independent prognostic factor for PFS (hazard ratio [HR]=2.12; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.13-3.95; P=0.019) and OS (HR=2.41; 95% CI=1.24-4.68; P=0.009).

Predicting residual neck disease in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated with radiation therapy: utility of p16 status.,Archives of otolaryngology--head & neck surgery,Arch. Otolaryngol. Head Neck Surg.,2009-11-01,"To identify factors that predict complete response of cervical nodal disease to radiation therapy (RT) in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OP-SCCA). Histologic analysis of prospectively collected specimens and retrospective medical chart review. Tertiary referral center. Sixty-nine patients with OP-SCCA treated from January 1, 2002, through June 1, 2008. Definitive RT, with or without chemotherapy and with or without neck dissection (ND). Presence of a viable tumor in post-RT ND specimen. Tissue specimens from 69 patients with OP-SCCA treated primarily with RT, with or without chemotherapy, were evaluated. Of these, 47 (68.1%) were strongly and diffusely positive for p16 expression by immunohistochemical analysis, signifying human papillomavirus positivity. Patients with p16-positive and p16-negative tumors (hereinafter, p16+ and p16-, respectively) had similarly sized primary tumors on presentation, but p16+ primary tumors were associated with more advanced neck disease (nodal stages N2c-N3; 31.9% vs 4.5% for p16- tumors) and more contralateral nodes (27.7% vs 4.5% for p16- tumors). Forty-seven patients (59.0%) underwent planned posttreatment ND (a total of 55 NDs). The NDs performed for p16- tumors were significantly more likely to have viable tumor in the specimen (50.0% vs 18.0% for p16+ tumors; P = .02).

Case series with chart review. A community teaching hospital. Patients with advanced OPSCC who received a uniform CRT protocol at Greater Baltimore Medical Center (GBMC). Medical records of patients treated with primary CRT for locoregionally advanced OPSCC at GBMC between 2001 and 2007 were reviewed. All patients received 7000 to 7500, 6000, and 5000 cGy to primary disease sites, involved cervical lymphatics, and uninvolved cervical and supraclavicular lymphatics, respectively, with concomitant cisplatin (12 mg/m(2)/1 h) and 5-fluorouracil (600 mg/m(2)/20 h) given on days one through five and 29 through 33. Seventy-six patients received CRT, and 41 met the criteria for neck dissection. Forty-eight neck dissections were performed (34 unilateral and 7 bilateral), of which 23 (48%) were CNDs and 25 (52%) were SNDs. Residual carcinoma was found in six (26%) of the CND and five (20%) of the SND heminecks. The CND group had six (26%) complications, whereas the SND group had two (8%). The high rate of residual disease demonstrated in this study supports the need for post-CRT neck dissection. Although complication rates were not significantly different between the two groups, the trend in this study indicates that SND results in less morbidity.

Development of prototype shielded cervical intracavitary brachytherapy applicators compatible with CT and MR imaging.,Medical physics,Med Phys,2009-12-01,"Intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) is an integral part of the treatment regimen for cervical cancer and, generally, outcome in terms of local disease control and complications is a function of dose to the disease bed and critical structures, respectively. Therefore, it is paramount to accurately determine the dose given via ICBT to the tumor bed as well as critical structures. This is greatly facilitated through the use of advanced three-dimensional imaging modalities, such as CT and MR, to delineate critical and target structures with an ICBT applicator inserted in vivo. These methods are not possible when using a shielded applicator due to the image artifacts generated by interovoid shielding. The authors present two prototype shielded ICBT applicators that can be utilized for artifact-free CT image acquisition. They also investigate the MR amenability and dosimetry of a novel tungsten-alloy shielding material to extend the functionality of these devices. To accomplish artifact-free CT image acquisition, a ""step-and-shoot"" (S&S) methodology was utilized, which exploits the prototype applicators movable interovoid shielding. Both prototypes were placed in imaging phantoms that positioned the applicators in clinically applicable orientations. CT image sets were acquired of the prototype applicators as well as a shielded Fletcher-Williamson (sFW) ovoid. Artifacts present in each CT image set were qualitatively compared for each prototype applicator following the S&S methodology and the sFW. To test the novel tungsten-alloy shielding material's MR amenability, they constructed a phantom applicator that mimics the basic components of an ICBT ovoid. This phantom applicator positions the MR-compatible shields in orientations equivalent to the sFW bladder and rectal shields. MR images were acquired within a gadopentetate dimeglumine-doped water tank using standard pulse sequences and examined for artifacts. In addition, Monte Carlo simulations were performed to match the attenuation due to the thickness of this new shield type with current, clinically utilized ovoid shields and a 192Ir HDR/PDR source. Artifact-free CT images could be acquired of both generation applicators in a clinically applicable geometry using the S&S method. MR images were acquired of the phantom applicator containing shields, which contained minimal, clinically relevant artifacts. The thickness required to match the dosimetry of the MR-compatible and sFW rectal shields was determined using Monte Carlo simulations. Utilizing a S&S imaging method in conjunction with prototype applicators that feature movable interovoid shields, they were able to acquire artifact-free CT image sets in a clinically applicable geometry. MR images were acquired of a phantom applicator that contained shields composed of a novel tungsten alloy.

Pneumonectomy for lung cancer after preoperative concurrent chemotherapy and high-dose radiation.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2010-01-01,"We studied the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients undergoing pneumonectomy after preoperative concurrent chemoradiation for non-small cell lung cancer. Clinical records of patients with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent pneumonectomy at our institution between 1995 and 2005 after preoperative concurrent chemoradiation were reviewed retrospectively. Twenty-nine patients underwent pneumonectomy after preoperative concurrent chemoradiation. Of the 21 men and 8 women who were treated, 1 had stage IIB (T3N0M0) and the remainder had stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. Mean patient age at surgery was 53.4 years. There were 15 right pneumonectomies, of which 2 were for pancoast tumors. All patients received concurrent preoperative chemoradiation. Mean total radiation dose was 61.1 Gy. All patients went on to have complete (R0) resection by pneumonectomy. Pathologic complete response was found in 16 patients (55.2%). All patients were discharged alive from the hospital after pneumonectomy. Median hospital length of stay was 5 days (mean 8.6). Ninety-day mortality after surgery was 3.4% (n = 1). Recurrences have been found in 11 patients (38%), including brain metastases (n = 6), bone metastases (n = 4), liver metastases (n = 2), and cervical lymph node metastases (n = 2). One patient had a contralateral new primary lung cancer develop 70 months after undergoing pneumonectomy. Estimated 5-year disease-free survival is 48%. Median survival time has not been reached. Pneumonectomy can be performed safely after preoperative concurrent chemoradiation, even with high-dose radiation.

Single photon emission computed tomography SPECT-CT improves sentinel node detection and localization in cervical and uterine malignancy.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2010-02-01,"Planar lymphoscintigraphy (LSG) is frequently performed for the assessment of the sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in gynecologic malignancies. Planar imaging helps to localize hot nodes but lacks accuracy of the anatomic location of those nodes. In this study, we compared SPECT-CT to planar LSG in endometrial and cervical cancer to assess its ability to localize SLN. We conducted a prospective nonrandomized study of SLN mapping in women with endometrial and cervical cancer. Forty patients with endometrial cancer and 10 with cervical cancer underwent pre-operative LSG with 1 or 4 mCi of (99m)Tc sulfur colloid administered as injections into the cervix. All patients were scanned immediately with planar LSG obtained in the anterior and lateral views. SPECT-CT imaging was obtained following the planar imaging. Planar LSG alone localized SLN in 30/40 (75%) endometrial cancer patients while SPECT-CT localized SLN in all 40 patients (100%). In the 10 cases where SLN was not identified with planar imaging, SPECT-CT localized nodes in the external iliac, internal iliac, common iliac and obturator groups. In cervical cancer, planar LSG alone localized sentinel lymph nodes in 8/10 patients (80%) as compared to SPECT-CT, which localized nodes in all 10 patients (100%). SPECT-CT imaging was especially useful in delineating external iliac versus internal iliac or obturator nodes, and the parametrial nodal uptake.

Patient age ranged from 21 to 49 years. Participants completed a 1-time self-report survey, including medical and demographic information and empirical measures of mood (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale), distress (Impact of Event Scale), sexual function (Female Sexual Function Index), and menopause (Menopausal Symptom Checklist). Eighty-four (96%) of the 88 enrolled patients had undergone a surgical intervention as part of their cancer treatment. Sixty-three patients (77%) reported clinically significant levels of distress in relation to loss of fertility or impaired fertility. Survivors' levels of distress (P < 0.0001) and depression (P < 0.0001) were associated with the severity and number of menopausal symptoms reported. Patients who retained functioning ovaries (partial fertility) (41%, n = 36) reported being less bothered by menopausal symptoms (P = 0.01) and having higher sexual functioning than those with ovarian failure (P < 0.0001). The emotional and physical impact of impaired or loss of fertility can be complex and long lasting, with women experiencing high levels of distress, menopausal symptoms, and changes in sexual function persisting into survivorship.

Oncol.,2010-02-08,"The validity of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for T1 or T2, clinically N0, oral cancer was tested by correlation of sentinel node pathologic status with that of nodes within the completion neck dissection. This prospective, cooperative group trial involved 25 institutions over a 3-year period. One hundred forty patients with invasive oral cancers, stage T1 and T2, N0 including 95 cancers of the tongue, 26 of the floor of mouth, and 19 other oral cancers were studied. The study excluded lesions with diameter smaller than 6 mm or minimal invasion. Imaging was used to exclude nonpalpable gross nodal disease. Patients underwent injection of the lesion with (99m)Tc-sulfur colloid, nuclear imaging, narrow-exposure SLNB, and completion selective neck dissection. The major end point was the negative-predictive value (NPV) of SLNB. In the 106 SLNBs, which were found to be pathologically and clinically node-negative by routine hematoxylin and eosin stain, 100 patients were found to have no other pathologically positive nodes, corresponding to a NPV of 94%. With additional sectioning and immunohistochemistry, NPV was improved to 96%. In the forty patients with proven cervical metastases, the true-positive rate was 90.2% and was superior for tongue tumors relative to floor of mouth. For T1 lesions, metastases were correctly identified in 100%. For T1 or T2 N0 oral squamous cell carcinoma, SLNB with step sectioning and immunohistochemistry, performed by surgeons of mixed experience levels, correctly predicted a pathologically negative neck in 96% of patients (NPV, 96%).",Comparative Study,3634.0,195.0,The validity of sentinel lymph node biopsy SLNB for T1 or T2 clinically N0 oral cancer was tested by correlation of sentinel node pathologic status with that of nodes within the completion dissection This prospective cooperative group trial involved 25 institutions over a 3-year period One hundred forty patients with invasive oral cancers stage T1 and T2 N0 including 95 cancers of the tongue 26 of the floor of mouth and 19 other oral cancers were studied The study excluded lesions with diameter smaller than 6 mm or minimal invasion Imaging was used to exclude nonpalpable gross nodal disease Patients underwent injection of the lesion with 99m Tc-sulfur colloid nuclear imaging narrow-exposure SLNB and completion selective dissection The major end point was the negative-predictive value NPV of SLNB In the 106 SLNBs which were found to be pathologically and clinically node-negative by routine hematoxylin and eosin stain 100 patients were found to have no other pathologically positive nodes corresponding to a NPV of 94 With additional sectioning and immunohistochemistry NPV was improved to 96 In the forty patients with proven metastases the true-positive rate was 90.2 and was superior for tongue tumors relative to floor of mouth For T1 lesions metastases were correctly identified in 100 For T1 or T2 N0 oral squamous cell carcinoma SLNB with step sectioning and immunohistochemistry performed by surgeons of mixed experience levels correctly predicted a pathologically negative in 96 of patients NPV 96,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[3, 3099, 1, 1323, 263, 289, 411, 2272, 9, 1534, 15, 1786, 505, 3394, 518, 12, 10, 650, 20, 816, 1, 1323, 289, 510, 156, 5, 17, 1, 502, 262, 3, 1438, 1161, 26, 482, 1690, 87, 160, 646, 243, 1764, 252, 8, 27, 111, 727, 104, 1128, 1213, 7, 5, 416, 518, 163, 82, 1534, 2, 1786, 3394, 141, 48, 163, 1, 3, 4391, 432, 1, 3, 12557, 1, 5831, 2, 326, 127, 518, 163, 11, 656, 3, 45, 1800, 406, 5, 2549, 2170, 76, 49, 321, 15, 1048, 578, 270, 10, 95, 6, 6262, 11734, 1789, 779, 34, 7, 208, 1754, 1, 3, 1180, 5, 6314, 3072, 10266, 7245, 928, 270, 6958, 645, 2272, 2, 1438, 1094, 1161, 3, 458, 396, 741, 10, 3, 199, 464, 549, 6771, 1, 2272, 4, 3, 3251, 24889, 92, 11, 204, 6, 40, 2998, 2, 505, 289, 199, 20, 1311, 6209, 2, 5975, 8763, 394, 7, 11, 204, 6, 47, 77, 127, 2998, 109, 502, 1734, 6, 8, 6771, 1, 960, 5, 402, 12969, 2, 888, 6771, 10, 231, 6, 921, 4, 3, 1213, 7, 5, 1930, 196, 3, 2501, 109, 116, 10, 424, 18, 2, 10, 1123, 9, 4391, 57, 580, 6, 12557, 1, 5831, 9, 1534, 406, 196, 11, 4911, 108, 4, 394, 9, 1534, 15, 1786, 3394, 518, 691, 31, 134, 2272, 5, 2458, 12969, 2, 888, 173, 20, 1613, 1, 1739, 730, 148, 4911, 783, 8, 2998, 199, 4, 921, 1, 7, 6771, 921]",1518.0,20142602,660

Cancer Res.,2010-02-09,"This study assessed the safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity of three times weekly i.v. 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (3-AP, NSC #663249) in combination with once-weekly i.v. cisplatin and daily pelvic radiation in patients with gynecologic malignancies. 3-AP is a novel small-molecule inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) and is being tested as a potential radiosensitizer and chemosensitizer. Patients with stage IB2 to IVB cervical cancer (n = 10) or recurrent uterine sarcoma (n = 1) were assigned to dose-finding cohorts of 2-hour 3-AP infusions during 5 weeks of cisplatin chemoradiation. Pharmacokinetic and methemoglobin samples and tumor biopsy for RNR activity were obtained on day 1 and day 10. Clinical response was assessed. The maximum tolerated 3-AP dose was 25 mg/m(2) given three times weekly during cisplatin and pelvic radiation. Two patients experienced manageable 3-AP-related grade 3 or 4 electrolyte abnormalities. 3-AP pharmacokinetics showed a 2-hour half-life, with median peak plasma concentrations of 277 ng/mL (25 mg/m(2)) and 467 ng/mL (50 mg/m(2)). Median methemoglobin levels peaked at 1% (25 mg/m(2)) and 6% (50 mg/m(2)) at 4 hours after initiating 3-AP infusions. No change in RNR activity was found on day 1 versus day 10 in six early complete responders, whereas elevated RNR activity was seen on day 10 as compared with day 1 in four late complete responders (P = 0.02). Ten (100%) patients with stage IB2 to IVB cervical cancer achieved complete clinical response and remained without disease relapse with a median 18 months of follow-up (6-32 months). 3-AP was well tolerated at a three times weekly i.v. 25 mg/m(2) dose during cisplatin and pelvic radiation.

Metastases to the craniovertebral junction.,Neurosurgery,Neurosurgery,2010-03-01,"This study reviews the relevant literature regarding the management of craniovertebral junction (CVJ) metastases. These rare tumors present significant diagnostic and treatment challenges. A PubMed search of cervical spine, cervical spine metastasis, craniovertebral junction, atlantoaxial spine, and metastasis radiation was conducted to define the epidemiology, imaging, and treatment protocols in the management of metastatic CVJ tumors. CVJ tumors represent less than 1% of spinal metastases, and the literature is limited to small case series. CVJ tumors present with flexion, extension, and rotational pain, often associated with occipital neuralgia. Magnetic resonance imaging is the most sensitive imaging modality for the detection of spinal metastases, but plain x-rays, computed tomography, and [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose play a role in diagnosis and management. Conventional external beam radiation therapy or stereotactic radiosurgery effectively treat the majority of patients with normal spinal alignment or minimal fracture subluxations. Surgery should be considered in patients with fracture subluxations greater than 5 mm, or 3.5 mm subluxation with 11-degree angulation. The palliative goals for surgery favor posterior approaches only including laminectomy for decompression, without the need for anterior approaches with the associated morbidity. Occipitocervical instrumentation using screw-rod systems are effective for irreducible subluxations, but posterior strategies using C1-C2 or C1-C3 can be used for patients with reducible subluxations. Effective management of CVJ tumors using radiation and/or surgery results in significant pain and functional improvement in properly selected patients.

Intensity-modulated radiotherapy for cervical node squamous cell carcinoma metastases from unknown head-and-neck primary site: M. D. Anderson Cancer Center outcomes and patterns of failure.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2010-03-06,"Conventional therapy for cervical node squamous cell carcinoma metastases from an unknown primary can cause considerable toxicity owing to the volume of tissues to be irradiated. In the present study, hypothesizing that using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) would provide effective treatment with minimal toxicity, we reviewed the outcomes and patterns of failure for head-and-neck unknown primary cancer at a single tertiary cancer center. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 52 patients who had undergone IMRT for an unknown primary at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1998 and 2005. The patient and treatment characteristics were extracted and the survival rates calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Of the 52 patients, 5 presented with Stage N1, 11 with Stage N2a, 23 with Stage N2b, 6 with Stage N2c, 4 with Stage N3, and 3 with Stage Nx disease. A total of 26 patients had undergone neck dissection, 13 before and 13 after IMRT; 14 patients had undergone excisional biopsy and presented for IMRT without evidence of disease. Finally, 14 patients had received systemic chemotherapy. All patients underwent IMRT to targets on both sides of the neck and pharyngeal axis. The median follow-up time for the surviving patients was 3.7 years. The 5-year actuarial rate of primary mucosal tumor control and regional control was 98% and 94%, respectively. Only 3 patients developed distant metastasis with locoregional control. The 5-year actuarial disease-free and overall survival rate was 88% and 89%, respectively.

Expression of nuclear transcription factor kappa B in locally advanced human cervical cancer treated with definitive chemoradiation.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2010-03-16,"Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), a transcriptional factor that has been shown to be constitutively active in cervical cancer, is part of an important pathway leading to treatment resistance in many tumor types. The purpose of our study was to determine whether expression of NF-κB in pretreatment specimens and specimens taken shortly after treatment initiation correlated with outcome in cervical cancer patients treated with definitive chemoradiation. Eighteen patients with locally advanced cervical cancer were enrolled in a study in which cervical biopsy specimens were obtained before radiation therapy and 48 h after treatment initiation. Matched biopsy specimens from 16 of these patients were available and evaluated for the nuclear expression of NF-κB protein by immunohistochemical staining. After a median follow-up of 43 months, there were 9 total treatment failures. Nuclear staining for NF-κB was positive in 3 of 16 pretreatment biopsy specimens (19%) and 5 of 16 postradiation biopsy specimens (31%). Pretreatment expression of NF-κB nuclear staining correlated with increased rates of local-regional failure (100% vs. 23%, p = 0.01), distant failure (100% vs. 38%, p = 0.055), disease-specific mortality (100% vs. 31%, p = 0.03), and overall mortality (100% vs. 38%, p = 0.055). Our data suggest that pretreatment nuclear expression of NF-κB may be associated with a poor outcome for cervical cancer patients treated with chemoradiation.

HPV16 encodes three oncogenes: E5, E6, and E7. Although E6 and E7 have been well-studied and clearly shown to be important contributors to these cancers, less is known about E5. In this study, we used E5 transgenic mice to investigate the role of E5 in cervical cancer. When treated for 6 months with estrogen, a cofactor for cervical carcinogenesis, E5 transgenic mice developed more severe neoplastic cervical disease than similarly treated nontransgenic mice, although no frank cancers were detected. In addition, E5 when combined with either E6 or E7 induced more severe neoplastic disease than seen in mice expressing only one viral oncogene.

Ectopic expression of X-linked lymphocyte-regulated protein pM1 renders tumor cells resistant to antitumor immunity.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2010-04-01,"Tumor immune escape is a major obstacle in cancer immunotherapy, but the mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. We have previously developed an immune evasion tumor model using an in vivo immune selection strategy and revealed Akt-mediated immune resistance to antitumor immunity induced by various cancer immunotherapeutic agents. In the current study, we used microarray gene analysis to identify an Akt-activating candidate molecule overexpressed in immune-resistant tumors compared with parental tumors. X-linked lymphocyte-regulated protein pM1 (XLR) gene was the most upregulated in immune-resistant tumors compared with parental tumor cells. Furthermore, the retroviral transduction of XLR in parental tumor cells led to activation of Akt, resulting in upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins and the induction of immune resistance phenotype in parental tumor cells. In addition, we found that transduction of parental tumor cells with other homologous genes from the mouse XLR family, such as synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SCP3) and XLR-related, meiosis-regulated protein (XMR) and its human counterpart of SCP3 (hSCP3), also led to activation of Akt, resulting in the upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins and induction of immune resistance phenotype. Importantly, characterization of a panel of human cervical cancers revealed relatively higher expression levels of hSCP3 in human cervical cancer tissue compared with normal cervical tissue. Thus, our data indicate that ectopic expression of XLR and its homologues in tumor cells represents a potentially important mechanism for tumor immune evasion and serves as a promising molecular target for cancer immunotherapy.",Journal Article,3582.0,16.0,Tumor immune escape is a major obstacle in cancer immunotherapy but the mechanisms involved remain poorly understood We have previously developed an immune evasion tumor model using an in vivo immune selection strategy and revealed Akt-mediated immune resistance to antitumor immunity induced by various cancer immunotherapeutic agents In the current study we used microarray gene analysis to identify an Akt-activating candidate molecule overexpressed in immune-resistant tumors compared with parental tumors X-linked lymphocyte-regulated protein pM1 XLR gene was the most upregulated in immune-resistant tumors compared with parental tumor cells Furthermore the retroviral transduction of XLR in parental tumor cells led to activation of Akt resulting in upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins and the induction of immune resistance phenotype in parental tumor cells In addition we found that transduction of parental tumor cells with other homologous genes from the mouse XLR family such as synaptonemal complex protein 3 SCP3 and XLR-related meiosis-regulated protein XMR and its human counterpart of SCP3 hSCP3 also led to activation of Akt resulting in the upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins and induction of immune resistance phenotype Importantly characterization of a panel of human cancers revealed relatively higher expression levels of hSCP3 in human cancer tissue compared with normal tissue Thus our data indicate that ectopic expression of XLR and its homologues in tumor cells represents a potentially important mechanism for tumor immune evasion and serves as a promising molecular target for cancer immunotherapy,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[30, 250, 3776, 16, 8, 458, 7414, 4, 12, 726, 84, 3, 483, 646, 918, 1240, 1784, 21, 47, 373, 276, 35, 250, 5351, 30, 202, 75, 35, 4, 386, 250, 881, 692, 2, 553, 649, 517, 250, 251, 6, 579, 1604, 277, 20, 747, 12, 3222, 183, 4, 3, 291, 45, 21, 95, 1727, 145, 65, 6, 255, 35, 649, 1616, 1609, 1354, 1711, 4, 250, 436, 57, 72, 5, 3418, 57, 1006, 1199, 1448, 1065, 178, 45977, 31611, 145, 10, 3, 96, 2684, 4, 250, 436, 57, 72, 5, 3418, 30, 37, 798, 3, 8658, 2761, 1, 31611, 4, 3418, 30, 37, 836, 6, 363, 1, 649, 1113, 4, 2218, 1, 4176, 652, 2, 3, 504, 1, 250, 251, 1005, 4, 3418, 30, 37, 4, 352, 21, 204, 17, 2761, 1, 3418, 30, 37, 5, 127, 3894, 214, 29, 3, 830, 31611, 607, 225, 22, 58849, 840, 178, 27, 45978, 2, 31611, 139, 33676, 1065, 178, 58850, 2, 211, 171, 10423, 1, 45978, 45979, 120, 836, 6, 363, 1, 649, 1113, 4, 3, 2218, 1, 4176, 652, 2, 504, 1, 250, 251, 1005, 1859, 2136, 1, 8, 993, 1, 171, 163, 553, 1352, 142, 55, 148, 1, 45979, 4, 171, 12, 246, 72, 5, 295, 246, 631, 114, 74, 1008, 17, 3647, 55, 1, 31611, 2, 211, 22169, 4, 30, 37, 1449, 8, 751, 305, 670, 9, 30, 250, 5351, 2, 4711, 22, 8, 721, 219, 283, 9, 12, 726]",1634.0,20395201,255

We tested associations between hematologic nadirs during chemoradiotherapy and the volume of BM receiving≥10 and 20 Gy (V10 and V20) using a previously developed linear regression model. The validation cohort consisted of 44 cervical cancer patients treated with concurrent cisplatin and pelvic radiotherapy. Subsequently, these data were pooled with data from 37 identically treated patients from a previous study, forming a cohort of 81 patients for normal tissue complication probability analysis. Generalized linear modeling was used to test associations between hematologic nadirs and dosimetric parameters, adjusting for body mass index. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to derive optimal dosimetric planning constraints. In the validation cohort, significant negative correlations were observed between white blood cell count nadir and V10 (regression coefficient (β)=-0.060, p=0.009) and V20 (β=-0.044, p=0.010). In the combined cohort, the (adjusted) β estimates for log (white blood cell) vs. V10 and V20 were as follows: -0.022 (p=0.025) and -0.021 (p=0.002), respectively.

Impact of bone marrow radiation dose on acute hematologic toxicity in cervical cancer: principal component analysis on high dimensional data.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2010-05-14,"To study the effects of increasing pelvic bone marrow (BM) radiation dose on acute hematologic toxicity in patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy, using a novel modeling approach to preserve the local spatial dose information. The study included 37 cervical cancer patients treated with concurrent weekly cisplatin and pelvic radiation therapy. The white blood cell count nadir during treatment was used as the indicator for acute hematologic toxicity. Pelvic BM radiation dose distributions were standardized across patients by registering the pelvic BM volumes to a common template, followed by dose remapping using deformable image registration, resulting in a dose array. Principal component (PC) analysis was applied to the dose array, and the significant eigenvectors were identified by linear regression on the PCs. The coefficients for PC regression and significant eigenvectors were represented in three dimensions to identify critical BM subregions where dose accumulation is associated with hematologic toxicity. We identified five PCs associated with acute hematologic toxicity. PC analysis regression modeling explained a high proportion of the variation in acute hematologicity (adjusted R(2), 0.49).

This study assesses the relative impact of race/ethnicity and neighborhood poverty on cervical cancer incidence and mortality in New York City (NYC). Invasive cervical cancer cases in NYC from 1995 to 2006 were identified along with demographic and socioeconomic measures. Odds ratios (OR) of late stage diagnosis were estimated using logistic regression. Hazard ratios (HR) of death were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression. From 1995 to 2006 cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates decreased in NYC, though black and Hispanic women had higher incidence and mortality rates than white women. Puerto Ricans (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.20-2.01) and blacks (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.15-1.57) were more likely to be diagnosed with late stage disease than whites.

E6-associated protein is required for human papillomavirus type 16 E6 to cause cervical cancer in mice.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2010-06-08,"High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) cause certain anogenital and head and neck cancers. E6, one of three potent HPV oncogenes that contribute to the development of these malignancies, is a multifunctional protein with many biochemical activities. Among these activities are its ability to bind and inactivate the cellular tumor suppressor p53, induce expression of telomerase, and bind to various other proteins, including Bak, E6BP1, and E6TP1, and proteins that contain PDZ domains, such as hScrib and hDlg. Many of these activities are thought to contribute to the role of E6 in carcinogenesis. The interaction of E6 with many of these cellular proteins, including p53, leads to their destabilization. This property is mediated at least in part through the ability of E6 to recruit the ubiquitin ligase E6-associated protein (E6AP) into complexes with these cellular proteins, resulting in their ubiquitin-mediated degradation by the proteasome. In this study, we address the requirement for E6AP in mediating acute and oncogenic phenotypes of E6, including induction of epithelial hyperplasia, abrogation of DNA damage response, and induction of cervical cancer.

In cervical cancer, EGFR and HER2/neu overexpression and high microvascular density correlate with survival. Patients with measurable stage IVB persistent/recurrent cervical carcinoma not amenable to curative therapy and at least one prior regimen in the metastatic setting were randomly assigned in a ratio of 1:1:1 to pazopanib at 800 mg once daily, lapatinib at 1,500 mg once daily, or lapatinib plus pazopanib combination therapy (lapatinib at 1,000 mg plus pazopanib at 400 mg once daily or lapatinib at 1,500 mg plus pazopanib at 800 mg once daily). Therapy continued until progression or withdrawal because of adverse events (AEs). Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS), and secondary end points were overall survival (OS), response rate (RR), and safety. The futility boundary was crossed at the planned interim analysis for combination therapy compared with lapatinib therapy, and the combination was discontinued. Of 230 patients enrolled, 152 were randomly assigned to the monotherapy arms: pazopanib (n = 74) or lapatinib (n = 78). Most patients (62%) had recurrent cancer. Pazopanib improved PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; 90% CI, 0.48 to 0.91; P = .013) and OS (HR, 0.67; 90% CI, 0.46 to 0.99; P = .045). Median OS was 50.7 weeks and 39.1 weeks and RRs were 9% and 5% for pazopanib and lapatinib, respectively. The only grade 3 AE > 10% was diarrhea (11% pazopanib and 13% lapatinib).

Proton radiotherapy: the biological effect of treating alternating subsets of fields for different treatment fractions.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2010-08-02,"Common practice in proton radiotherapy is to deliver a subset of all fields in the treatment plan on any given treatment day. We investigate using biological modeling if the resulting variation in daily dose to normal tissues has a relevant detrimental biological effect. For four patient groups, the cumulative normalized total dose (NTD) was determined for normal tissues (OARs) of each patient using the clinically delivered fractionation schedule (FS(clin)), and for hypothetical fractionation schedules delivering all fields every day (FS(all)) or only a single field each day (FS(single)). Cumulative three-dimensional NTD distributions were summarized using the generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) model. For the skull base/cervical spine chordoma group, the largest effect is a 4-Gy increase in gEUD of the chiasm when treating only a subset of fields on any day. For lung cancer and pancreatic cancer patients, the variation in the gEUD of normal tissues is <0.2 Gy. For the prostate group, FS(clin) increases the gEUD of the femoral heads by 9 Gy compared with FS(all). Use of FS(single) resulted in the highest NTD to normal tissues for any patient.

Epitrochlear lymph node dissection.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2010-08-03,"Epitrochlear node involvement occurs in a small minority of patients with forearm or hand melanoma. Although in-transit sentinel lymph nodes are identified infrequently, they contain metastatic disease at nearly the same frequency as sentinel lymph nodes in cervical, axillary, and inguinal nodal basins. Positive in-transit sentinel lymph nodes are likely to be the only site of nodal metastasis. Therefore, detailed preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and meticulous intraoperative search for in-transit nodes should be performed. The recovery of nodes from in-transit nodal areas is low; however, there appears to be an increase in the performance of these dissections since the advent of lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy.

A cervical biopsy diagnosis of CIN 2+ was considered as evidence of high grade disease. The positive and negative predictive values of HC2 and FISH for detecting patients with CIN 2+ were 32% vs. 37% and 100% vs. 93%, respectively. The sensitivities of HC2 and FISH for CIN 2+ were not significantly different (100% vs. 90%, p = 0.25), while the specificity of HC2 was significantly lower than that of FISH (28% vs. 48%, p=0.003).

The primary objective of the current study was to determine whether the use of HA-CMC is associated with the development of postoperative intra-abdominal collections in patients undergoing laparotomy for uterine or cervical malignancies. We retrospectively identified all laparotomies performed for these malignancies from 3/1/05 to 12/31/07. We identified cases involving the use of HA-CMC via billing records and operative reports. Intra-abdominal collections were defined as localized intraperitoneal fluid accumulations in the absence of re-accumulating ascites. We noted incidences of intra-abdominal collections, as well as other complications. Appropriate statistical tests were applied using SPSS 15.0. We identified 169 laparotomies in which HA-CMC was used and 347 in which HA-CMC was not used. The following were statistically similar in both cohorts: age, body mass index (BMI), primary site, surgery for recurrent disease, prior intraperitoneal surgery, and extent of current surgery. Intra-abdominal collections were seen in 6 (3.6%) of 169 HA-CMC cases compared to 10 (2.9%) of 347 non-HA-CMC cases (p=0.7). The rate of infected collections was similar in both groups (1.2% vs. 1.4%).

Clinical outcomes of intensity-modulated pelvic radiation therapy for carcinoma of the cervix.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2010-08-12,"To evaluate disease outcomes and toxicity in cervical cancer patients treated with pelvic intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). We included all patients with Stage I-IVA cervical carcinoma treated with IMRT at three different institutions from 2000-2007. Patients treated with extended field or conventional techniques were excluded. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy plans were designed to deliver 45 Gy in 1.8-Gy daily fractions to the planning target volume while minimizing dose to the bowel, bladder, and rectum. Toxicity was graded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group system. Overall survival and disease-free survival were estimated by use of the Kaplan-Meier method. Pelvic failure, distant failure, and late toxicity were estimated by use of cumulative incidence functions. The study included 111 patients. Of these, 22 were treated with postoperative IMRT, 8 with IMRT followed by intracavitary brachytherapy and adjuvant hysterectomy, and 81 with IMRT followed by planned intracavitary brachytherapy. Of the patients, 63 had Stage I-IIA disease and 48 had Stage IIB-IVA disease. The median follow-up time was 27 months. The 3-year overall survival rate and the disease-free survival rate were 78% (95% confidence interval [CI], 68-88%) and 69% (95% CI, 59-81%), respectively. The 3-year pelvic failure rate and the distant failure rate were 14% (95% CI, 6-22%) and 17% (95% CI, 8-25%), respectively. Estimates of acute and late Grade 3 toxicity or higher were 2% (95% CI, 0-7%) and 7% (95% CI, 2-13%), respectively.

We previously established a model for HPV-associated HNSCC in which we treated transgenic mice expressing the papillomaviral oncoproteins with the chemical carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO). We found that the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein was highly potent in causing HNSCC, and its dominance masked any potential oncogenic contribution of E6, a second papillomaviral oncoprotein commonly expressed in human cancers. In the current study, we shortened the duration of treatment with 4-NQO to reduce the incidence of cancers and discovered a striking synergy between E6 and E7 in causing HNSCC.

Assessment and significance of quality of life in women with gynecologic cancer.,"Future oncology (London, England)",Future Oncol,2010-08-01,"In the design of randomized clinical trials, quality of life (QOL) has become an important component across multiple cancer types. QOL includes the measurement of patient-reported outcomes, mostly described as the physical, social, emotional and functional wellbeing of the patient. These realms of wellbeing are reported by the patient themself and are thought to be a subjective measurement of response to treatment and/or treatment outcomes. Therapeutic interventions such as chemotherapy and/or radiation can thus be monitored from a patient perspective. In addition, while researchers and oncologists may recognize the futility of advanced and/or recurrent cancer therapy in the setting of reduced QOL, patients may have difficulty with discontinuing therapy. QOL research adds to the literature by introducing a patient perspective into the decision to treat aggressively. Specifically, in gynecologic cancers, there is a wide range of outcomes and patient characteristics to be considered.

Reliability analysis of the epidural spinal cord compression scale.,Journal of neurosurgery. Spine,J Neurosurg Spine,2010-09-01,"The evolution of imaging techniques, along with highly effective radiation options has changed the way metastatic epidural tumors are treated. While high-grade epidural spinal cord compression (ESCC) frequently serves as an indication for surgical decompression, no consensus exists in the literature about the precise definition of this term. The advancement of the treatment paradigms in patients with metastatic tumors for the spine requires a clear grading scheme of ESCC. The degree of ESCC often serves as a major determinant in the decision to operate or irradiate. The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability and validity of a 6-point, MR imaging-based grading system for ESCC. To determine the reliability of the grading scale, a survey was distributed to 7 spine surgeons who participate in the Spine Oncology Study Group. The MR images of 25 cervical or thoracic spinal tumors were distributed consisting of 1 sagittal image and 3 axial images at the identical level including T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and Gd-enhanced T1-weighted images. The survey was administered 3 times at 2-week intervals. The inter- and intrarater reliability was assessed. The inter- and intrarater reliability ranged from good to excellent when surgeons were asked to rate the degree of spinal cord compression using T2-weighted axial images.

Patients completed self-report surveys composed of 4 empirical measures in addition to exploratory items. Data analyses for the 2 years of prospective data are presented. At preoperative assessment, women choosing RH reported greater concern about cancer recurrence (x=7.27 [scale from 0 to 10]) than women choosing RT (x=5.66) (P=0.008). Forty-eight percent undergoing RH compared to 8.6% undergoing RT reported having adequate ""time to complete childbearing"" (P<0.001).

Eligible patients included those who were candidates for treatment with radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy and had no evidence of para-aortic lymphadenopathy (all lymph nodes< 2 cm in diameter) by preoperative computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. All patients underwent preoperative positron emission tomography/computed tomography and laparoscopic extraperitoneal para-aortic lymphadenectomy. All lymph nodes were assessed for metastasis by routine hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. Ultrastaging (serial sectioning) and immunohistochemical analysis were performed in H&E-negative specimens. Thirteen (22%) of 60 consecutive patients had para-aortic lymph node metastases detected on routine H&E staining.

To examine adherence to population cancer screening guidelines by survivors at average risk for a second malignant neoplasm and adherence to cancer surveillance guidelines by survivors at high risk for a second malignant neoplasm. Retrospective cohort study. The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS), a 26-center study of long-term survivors of childhood cancer that was diagnosed between 1970 and 1986. 4329 male and 4018 female survivors of childhood cancer who completed a CCSS questionnaire assessing screening and surveillance for new cases of cancer. Patient-reported receipt and timing of mammography, Papanicolaou smear, colonoscopy, or skin examination was categorized as adherent to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines for survivors at average risk for breast or cervical cancer or the Children's Oncology Group guidelines for survivors at high risk for breast, colorectal, or skin cancer as a result of cancer therapy. In average-risk female survivors, 2743 of 3392 (80.9%) reported having a Papanicolaou smear within the recommended period, and 140 of 209 (67.0%) reported mammography within the recommended period. In high-risk survivors, rates of recommended mammography among women were only 241 of 522 (46.2%) and the rates of colonoscopy and complete skin examinations among both sexes were 91 of 794 (11.5%) and 1290 of 4850 (26.6%), respectively. Data were self-reported. Participants in the CCSS are a selected group of survivors, and their adherence may not be representative of all survivors of childhood cancer. Female survivors at average risk for a second malignant neoplasm show reasonable rates of screening for cervical and breast cancer. However, surveillance for new cases of cancer is very low in survivors at the highest risk for colon, breast, or skin cancer, suggesting that survivors and their physicians need education about their risks and recommended surveillance.

"Curcumin, the golden spice from Indian saffron, is a chemosensitizer and radiosensitizer for tumors and chemoprotector and radioprotector for normal organs.",Nutrition and cancer,Nutr Cancer,2010-01-01,"Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), the yellow pigment in Indian saffron (Curcuma longa; also called turmeric, haldi, or haridara in the East and curry powder in the West), has been consumed by people for centuries as a dietary component and for a variety of proinflammatory ailments. Extensive research within the last decade in cell culture and in rodents has revealed that curcumin can sensitize tumors to different chemotherapeutic agents including doxorubicin, 5-FU, paclitaxel, vincristine, melphalan, butyrate, cisplatin, celecoxib, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, etoposide, sulfinosine, thalidomide, and bortezomib. Chemosensitization has been observed in cancers of the breast, colon, pancreas, gastric, liver, blood, lung, prostate, bladder, cervix, ovary, head and neck, and brain and in multiple myeloma, leukemia, and lymphoma. Similar studies have also revealed that this agent can sensitize a variety of tumors to gamma radiation including glioma, neuroblastoma, cervical carcinoma, epidermal carcinoma, prostate cancer, and colon cancer. How curcumin acts as a chemosensitizer and radiosensitizer has also been studied extensively. For example, it downregulates various growth regulatory pathways and specific genetic targets including genes for NF-κB, STAT3, COX2, Akt, antiapoptotic proteins, growth factor receptors, and multidrug-resistance proteins. Although it acts as a chemosensitizer and radiosensitizer for tumors in some cases, curcumin has also been shown to protect normal organs such as liver, kidney, oral mucosa, and heart from chemotherapy and radiotherapy-induced toxicity. The protective effects of curcumin appear to be mediated through its ability to induce the activation of NRF2 and induce the expression of antioxidant enzymes (e.g., hemeoxygenase-1, glutathione peroxidase, modulatory subunit of gamma-glutamyl-cysteine ligase, and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1, increase glutathione (a product of the modulatory subunit of gamma-glutamyl-cysteine ligase), directly quench free radicals, and inhibit p300 HAT activity.

Anti-carcinogenic effects of sulforaphane in association with its apoptosis-inducing and anti-inflammatory properties in human cervical cancer cells.,Cancer epidemiology,Cancer Epidemiol,2010-10-16,"The multistep process of carcinogenesis is characterized by progressive disorganization and occurrence of initiation, promotion, and progression events. Several new strategies such as chemoprevention are being developed for treatment and prevention at various stages of carcinogenesis. Sulforaphane, a potential chemopreventive agent, possesses anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-cancer activities and has attracted extensive interest for better cancer management. We evaluated the effect of sulforaphane alone or in combination with gemcitabine on HeLa cells by cell viability assay and confirmed the results by apoptosis assay. Further we analyzed the effect of sulforaphane on the expression of Bcl-2, COX-2 and IL-1β by RT-PCR on HeLa cells. In the present study, sulforaphane was found to induce dose-dependent selective cytotoxicity in HeLa cells in comparison to normal cells pointing to its safe cytotoxicity profile. Additionally, a combination of sulforaphane and gemcitabine was found to increase the growth inhibition in a synergistic manner in HeLa cells compared to the individual drugs. Also, the expression analysis of genes involved in apoptosis and inflammation revealed significant downregulation of Bcl-2, COX-2 and IL-1β upon treatment with sulforaphane. Our results suggest that sulforaphane exerts its anticancer activities via apoptosis induction and anti-inflammatory properties and provides the first evidence demonstrating synergism between sulforaphane and gemcitabine which may enhance the therapeutic index of prevention and/or treatment of cervical cancer.",Journal Article,3384.0,31.0,The multistep process of carcinogenesis is characterized by progressive disorganization and occurrence of initiation promotion and progression events Several new strategies such as chemoprevention are being developed for treatment and prevention at various stages of carcinogenesis Sulforaphane a potential chemopreventive agent possesses anti-proliferative anti-inflammatory anti-oxidant and anti-cancer activities and has attracted extensive interest for better cancer management We evaluated the effect of sulforaphane alone or in combination with gemcitabine on HeLa cells by cell viability assay and confirmed the results by apoptosis assay Further we analyzed the effect of sulforaphane on the expression of Bcl-2 COX-2 and IL-1β by RT-PCR on HeLa cells In the present study sulforaphane was found to induce dose-dependent selective cytotoxicity in HeLa cells in comparison to normal cells pointing to its safe cytotoxicity profile Additionally a combination of sulforaphane and gemcitabine was found to increase the growth inhibition in a synergistic manner in HeLa cells compared to the individual drugs Also the expression analysis of genes involved in apoptosis and inflammation revealed significant downregulation of Bcl-2 COX-2 and IL-1β upon treatment with sulforaphane Our results suggest that sulforaphane exerts its anticancer activities via apoptosis induction and anti-inflammatory properties and provides the first evidence demonstrating synergism between sulforaphane and gemcitabine which may enhance the therapeutic index of prevention and/or treatment of cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[3, 9417, 1129, 1, 1719, 16, 765, 20, 1014, 39452, 2, 2291, 1, 1118, 5478, 2, 91, 281, 392, 217, 422, 225, 22, 2886, 32, 486, 276, 9, 24, 2, 1070, 28, 747, 1153, 1, 1719, 9510, 8, 174, 4401, 420, 9857, 312, 2441, 312, 1291, 312, 13322, 2, 312, 12, 2042, 2, 71, 14439, 1344, 1333, 9, 380, 12, 284, 21, 194, 3, 254, 1, 9510, 279, 15, 4, 150, 5, 679, 23, 8466, 37, 20, 31, 2120, 719, 2, 557, 3, 99, 20, 351, 719, 195, 21, 311, 3, 254, 1, 9510, 23, 3, 55, 1, 1044, 18, 418, 18, 2, 501, 8215, 20, 240, 604, 23, 8466, 37, 4, 3, 364, 45, 9510, 10, 204, 6, 1290, 61, 470, 1094, 1408, 4, 8466, 37, 4, 1155, 6, 295, 37, 11548, 6, 211, 1165, 1408, 800, 1724, 8, 150, 1, 9510, 2, 679, 10, 204, 6, 344, 3, 129, 297, 4, 8, 1806, 1708, 4, 8466, 37, 72, 6, 3, 797, 600, 120, 3, 55, 65, 1, 214, 646, 4, 351, 2, 1815, 553, 93, 2475, 1, 1044, 18, 418, 18, 2, 501, 8215, 1548, 24, 5, 9510, 114, 99, 309, 17, 9510, 5685, 211, 1475, 2042, 847, 351, 504, 2, 312, 1291, 1571, 2, 777, 3, 157, 241, 2219, 6494, 59, 9510, 2, 679, 92, 68, 1304, 3, 189, 558, 1, 1070, 2, 15, 24, 1, 12]",1584.0,20956097,525
The presence of human papillomavirus or p16 in six cases of retroperitoneal carcinoma.,Obstetrics and gynecology,Obstet Gynecol,2010-11-01,"To describe six cases of unknown primary carcinoma of the retroperitoneum that were positive for human papillomavirus (HPV), a surrogate molecular marker for high-risk HPV (p16), or both. Using the MD Anderson pathology database, females with confirmed HPV or p16 expression within retroperitoneal carcinomas of unknown primary were identified. Clinical data were collected by retrospective chart review. One pathologist reviewed all histology. Individuals with known primary were excluded. Data regarding individual demographics, presentation, Pap test history, pathology, HPV and p16 positivity, and outcome were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Six individuals were identified. The median age of the individuals was 43.5 years (range 27-54). Three malignancies (50%) were squamous and three (50%) were undifferentiated. Median follow-up was 12 months (range 6-48 months). Two of the six (33%) individuals had remote histories (more than 10 years) of abnormal Pap test results. All had normal gynecologic examination and Pap test results at diagnosis. Four tumors were HPV-positive (66%) and six were p16-positive (100%). All samples that were HPV-positive were also p16-positive. All individuals underwent treatment with chemotherapy, radiation, or both. One individual underwent initial attempt at resection that was unsuccessful.

We retrospectively identified all patients who underwent pelvic MRI and who had a preoperative diagnosis of cervical or endometrial cancer at MD Anderson Cancer Center between 1990 and 2006. The subset in which endometrial biopsy did not clarify the primary disease site was analyzed. Magnetic resonance imaging results were compared with postoperative histopathologic findings. A total of 168 patients who underwent MRI who had a preoperative diagnosis of cervical or endometrial cancer were identified. Of these patients, 51 had an inconclusive endometrial biopsy. Magnetic resonance imaging suggested an endometrial primary tumor without cervical invasion in 28 patients, of whom 21 (75%) actually had such a tumor and 7 had an endometrial primary tumor with cervical invasion. Magnetic resonance imaging suggested an endometrial primary tumor with cervical invasion in 3 patients, all of whom had such a tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging suggested a cervical primary tumor in 6 patients, of whom 5 had such a tumor and 1 had an endometrial primary tumor without cervical invasion. Magnetic resonance imaging was inconclusive (did not clarify primary disease site or no lesion visualized) in 14 (27%) of 51 patients, 6 of whom had an endocervical primary tumor or an endometrial tumor with cervical involvement.

Dosimetric comparison study between intensity modulated radiation therapy and three-dimensional conformal proton therapy for pelvic bone marrow sparing in the treatment of cervical cancer.,Journal of applied clinical medical physics,J Appl Clin Med Phys,2010-08-15,"The objective was to compare intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with 3D conformal proton therapy (3DCPT) in the treatment of cervical cancer. In particular, each technique's ability to spare pelvic bone marrow (PBM) was of primary interest in this study. A total of six cervical cancer patients (3 postoperative and 3 intact) were planned and analyzed. All plans had uniform 1.0 cm CTV-PTV margin and satisfied the 95% PTV with 100% isodose (prescription dose = 45 Gy) coverage. Dose-volume histograms (DVH) were analyzed for comparison. The overall PTV and PBM volumes were 1035.9 ± 192.2 cc and 1151.4 ± 198.3 cc, respectively. In terms of PTV dose conformity index (DCI) and dose homogeneity index (DHI), 3DCPT was slightly superior to IMRT with 1.00 ± 0.001, 1.01 ± 0.02, and 1.10 ± 0.02, 1.13 ± 0.01, respectively. In addition, 3DCPT demonstrated superiority in reducing lower doses (i.e., V30 or less) to PBM, small bowel and bladder. Particularly in PBM, average V10 and V20 reductions of 10.8% and 7.4% (p = 0.001 and 0.04), respectively, were observed. However, in the higher dose range, IMRT provided better sparing (> V30). For example, in small bowel and PBM, average reductions in V45 of 4.9% and 10.0% (p = 0.048 and 0.008), respectively, were observed. Due to its physical characteristics such as low entrance dose, spread-out Bragg peak and finite particle range of protons, 3DCPT illustrated superior target coverage uniformity and sparing of the lower doses in PBM and other organs. Further studies are, however, needed to fully exploit the benefits of protons for general use in cervical cancer.",Comparative Study,3446.0,20.0,The objective was to compare intensity-modulated radiation therapy IMRT with 3D conformal proton therapy 3DCPT in the treatment of cancer In particular each technique 's ability to spare pelvic marrow PBM was of primary interest in this study A total of six cancer patients 3 postoperative and 3 intact were planned and analyzed All plans had uniform 1.0 cm CTV-PTV margin and satisfied the 95 PTV with 100 isodose prescription dose 45 Gy coverage Dose-volume histograms DVH were analyzed for comparison The overall PTV and PBM volumes were 1035.9 ± 192.2 cc and 1151.4 ± 198.3 cc respectively In terms of PTV dose conformity index DCI and dose homogeneity index DHI 3DCPT was slightly superior to IMRT with 1.00 ± 0.001 1.01 ± 0.02 and 1.10 ± 0.02 1.13 ± 0.01 respectively In addition 3DCPT demonstrated superiority in reducing lower doses i.e. V30 or less to PBM small bowel and Particularly in PBM average V10 and V20 reductions of 10.8 and 7.4 p 0.001 and 0.04 respectively were observed However in the higher dose range IMRT provided better sparing V30 For example in small bowel and PBM average reductions in V45 of 4.9 and 10.0 p 0.048 and 0.008 respectively were observed Due to its physical characteristics such as low entrance dose spread-out Bragg peak and finite particle range of protons 3DCPT illustrated superior target coverage uniformity and sparing of the lower doses in PBM and other organs Further studies are however needed to fully exploit the benefits of protons for general use in cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[3, 461, 10, 6, 932, 837, 1757, 121, 36, 964, 5, 2265, 2972, 2095, 36, 35008, 4, 3, 24, 1, 12, 4, 1454, 296, 1312, 292, 801, 6, 8539, 1110, 581, 9215, 10, 1, 86, 1333, 4, 26, 45, 8, 181, 1, 437, 12, 7, 27, 573, 2, 27, 2964, 11, 1465, 2, 311, 62, 1853, 42, 3490, 14, 13, 494, 3402, 3303, 959, 2, 7411, 3, 48, 3303, 5, 394, 8945, 3584, 61, 512, 381, 2139, 61, 433, 8638, 8255, 11, 311, 9, 1155, 3, 63, 3303, 2, 9215, 2225, 11, 28784, 83, 810, 5016, 18, 1951, 2, 39474, 39, 810, 6189, 27, 1951, 106, 4, 1794, 1, 3303, 61, 8693, 558, 59546, 2, 61, 7502, 558, 59547, 35008, 10, 3223, 1123, 6, 964, 5, 14, 2038, 810, 13, 144, 14, 355, 810, 13, 588, 2, 14, 79, 810, 13, 588, 14, 233, 810, 13, 355, 106, 4, 352, 35008, 264, 5233, 4, 1818, 280, 415, 70, 563, 14613, 15, 299, 6, 9215, 302, 1659, 2, 823, 4, 9215, 1011, 10724, 2, 8120, 2153, 1, 79, 66, 2, 67, 39, 19, 13, 144, 2, 13, 755, 106, 11, 164, 137, 4, 3, 142, 61, 184, 964, 1052, 380, 1851, 14613, 9, 2685, 4, 302, 1659, 2, 9215, 1011, 2153, 4, 16984, 1, 39, 83, 2, 79, 13, 19, 13, 4969, 2, 13, 2155, 106, 11, 164, 520, 6, 211, 900, 374, 225, 22, 154, 22540, 61, 2579, 1205, 31700, 2944, 2, 14612, 5997, 184, 1, 6684, 35008, 8508, 1123, 283, 2139, 9338, 2, 1851, 1, 3, 280, 415, 4, 9215, 2, 127, 2285, 195, 94, 32, 137, 575, 6, 1910, 6109, 3, 1141, 1, 6684, 9, 1083, 119, 4, 12]",1511.0,21081882,819
Daily online cone beam computed tomography to assess interfractional motion in patients with intact cervical cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2010-11-23,"To quantify interfraction motion in patients with intact cervical cancer and assess implications for clinical target volume (CTV) coverage and required planning margins. We analyzed 10 patients undergoing external beam radiotherapy using online cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) before each fraction. CTVs were contoured on the planning CT and on each CBCT. Each CBCT was rigidly registered to the planning CT with respect to bony anatomy. The CTV from each CBCT was projected onto the planning CT and compared to the CTV from the planning CT. Uniform three-dimensional expansions were applied to the planning CTV to assess required planning margins. For each fraction, the minimum margin required to encompass the CTV was calculated, and the volume of CTV (on the CBCT) encompassed by the PTV was determined as a function of margin size. A uniform CTV planning treatment volume margin of 15 mm would have failed to encompass the CTV in 32% of fractions. The mean volume of CTV missed, however, was small (4 cc). The mean planning margin (across patients and fractions) required to encompass the CTV was 15 mm. Variation in margin estimates was high, with interpatient variation being the predominant component.

Fertility-sparing surgery in early-stage cervical cancer: indications and applications.,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,2010-12-01,"This article describes the surgical and pathologic findings of fertility-sparing radical trachelectomy using a standardized surgical technique, and reports the rate of posttrachelectomy outcomes. The authors analyzed a prospectively maintained database of all patients with FIGO stage IA1-IB1 cervical cancer admitted to the operating room for planned fertility-sparing radical abdominal trachelectomy. Sentinel node mapping was performed through cervical injection. Between November 2001 and May 2010, 98 consecutive patients with FIGO stage IA1-IB1 cervical cancer and a median age of 32 years (range, 6-45 years) underwent a fertility-sparing radical trachelectomy. The most common histology was adenocarcinoma in 54 patients (55%) and squamous carcinoma in 42 (43%). Lymph-vascular invasion was seen in 38 patients (39%). FIGO stages included IA1 (with lymph-vascular invasion) in 10 patients (10%), IA2 in 9 (9%), and IB1 in 79 (81%). Only 15 (15%) needed immediate completion radical hysterectomy because of intraoperative findings. Median number of nodes evaluated was 22 (range, 3-54), and 16 (16%) patients had positive pelvic nodes on final pathology. Final trachelectomy pathology showed no residual disease in 44 (45%) cases, dysplasia in 5 (5%), and adenocarcinoma in situ in 3 (3%). Overall, 27 (27%) patients needed hysterectomy or adjuvant pelvic radiation postoperatively. One (1%) documented recurrence was fatal at the time of this report. Cervical adenocarcinoma and lymph-vascular invasion are common features of patients selected for radical trachelectomy.

J. Gynecol. Cancer,2011-01-01,"The most common types of cervical cancer are squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and adenosquamous carcinoma, referred to here collectively as SA cervical cancer. Other types of cervical cancer, referred to here collectively as nonsquamous/nonadenocarcinoma (NSNA) cervical cancer, include neuroendocrine, small cell, clear cell, sarcomatoid, and serous tumors. Anecdotally, NSNA tumors seem to have a worse prognosis than their SA counterparts. We sought to determine whether patients with early-stage NSNA have a worse prognosis than those with early-stage SA cervical cancer. We retrospectively reviewed charts of women with stage IA1-IB2 NSNA cervical cancer treated by radical hysterectomy and lymph node staging at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from 1990 to 2006. The NSNA patients were matched 1:2 to patients with grade 3 SA lesions on the basis of stage, age at diagnosis, tumor size, and date of diagnosis. Eighteen patients with NSNA primary cervical cancer subtypes (neuroendocrine [n = 7], small cell [n = 5], clear cell [n = 4], papillary serous [n = 1], and sarcomatoid [n = 1]) were matched to 36 patients with grade 3 SA lesions. There were no differences between the 2 groups in age, body mass index, clinical stage, or lesion size. The 2 groups also did not differ with respect to number of nodes resected, lymphovascular space invasion, margin status, lymph node metastasis, or adjuvant radiation therapy or chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 44 months, median progression-free and overall survivals had not been reached; however, both progression-free survival (P = 0.018) and overall survival (P = 0.028) were worse for the NSNA group. The 5-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 61.2% and 67.6%, respectively, for the NSNA group, compared with 90.1% and 88.3%, respectively, for the SA group.

Glioneuronal tumor with neuropil-like islands of the spinal cord with diffuse leptomeningeal neuraxis dissemination.,Journal of neuro-oncology,J. Neurooncol.,2010-12-25,"A 54-year-old Caucasian female presented with a 1 year history of intermittent numbness of the left leg progressing to bilateral, lower extremity sensory loss that advanced to include impaired vibration and proprioception. The subsequent thoracic spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed a heterogeneous, avidly enhancing, centrally situated spinal cord mass involving T7 through T10 in association with thick linear enhancement of the anterior and posterior cord surfaces extending both superiorly and inferiorly. Both the cervical and lumbar spine MRI demonstrated diffuse leptomeningeal disease as well. A brain MRI revealed focal leptomeningeal enhancement in the left and right sylvian fissures, the suprasellar cistern, and the posterior fossa; a pattern consistent with metastatic disease. The patient underwent a T6-T10 laminectomy for tumor biopsy and debulking. Histology revealed a WHO grade III glioneuronal tumor with rosetted neuropil-like islands. Synaptophysin and neurofilament (NF) positive staining was noted within the neural appearing component, whereas, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunopositivity was evident in the fibrillary astrocytoma component of the tumor. The Ki-67 labeling index was 7%. This tumor pattern, now included in the 2007 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of central nervous system tumours as a pattern variation of anaplastic astrocytoma (Kleihues et al.

Sentinel lymph node biopsy in the management of early-stage cervical carcinoma.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2011-01-08,"We aimed to determine the sentinel lymph node detection rates, accuracy in predicting the status of lymph node metastasis, and if pathologic ultrastaging improves the detection of micrometastases and isolated tumor cells at the time of primary surgery for cervical cancer. A prospective, non-randomized study of women with early-stage (FIGO stage IA1 with lymphovascular space involvement--IIA) cervical carcinoma was conducted from June 2003 to August 2009. All patients underwent an intraoperative intracervical blue dye injection. Patients who underwent a preoperative lymphoscintigraphy received a 99m Tc sulfur colloid injection in addition. All patients underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification followed by a complete pelvic node and parametrial dissection. SLN were evaluated using our institutional protocol that included pathologic ultrastaging. SLN mapping was successful in 77 (95%) of 81 patients. A total of 316 SLN were identified, with a median of 3 SLN per patient (range, 0-10 SLN). The majority (85%) of SLN were located at three main sites: the external iliac (35%); internal iliac (30%); and obturator (20%). Positive lymph nodes (LN) were identified in 26 (32%) patients, including 21 patients with positive SLN. Fifteen of 21 patients (71%) had SLN metastasis detected on routine processing. SLN ultrastaging detected metastasis in an additional 6/21 patients (29%). Two patients had grossly positive LN at exploration, and mapping was abandoned. Three of 26 (12%) patients had successful SLN mapping; however, the SLN failed to identify the metastatic LN. Of these 3 false negative cases, 2 patients had a metastatic parametrial node as the only positive LN with multiple negative pelvic nodes including negative SLN. One patient with stage IA1 disease and lymphovascular invasion had unilateral SLN mapping and a metastatic common iliac LN identified on completion lymphadenectomy of the contralateral side that did not map. The 4 (5%) patients with unsuccessful mapping included 1 who had grossly positive nodes identified at the time of laparotomy; the remaining 3 occurred during each surgeon's initial SLN mapping learning phase. SLN mapping in early-stage cervical carcinoma yields high detection rates. Ultrastaging improves micrometastasis detection.

PIK3CA mutations in patients with advanced cancers treated with PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis inhibitors.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2011-01-07,"Preclinical data suggest that PIK3CA mutations predict response to PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors. Concomitant KRAS or BRAF mutations may mediate resistance. Therefore, tumors from patients referred to the phase I program for targeted therapy starting in October 2008 were analyzed for PIK3CA mutations using PCR-based DNA sequencing of exons 9 and 20. Consecutive patients with diverse tumor types and PIK3CA mutation were treated whenever possible with agents targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Overall, PIK3CA mutations were detected in 25 of 217 patients (11.5%; exon 9, n = 11; exon 20, n = 14). In tumor types with more than 10 patients tested, PIK3CA mutations were most frequent in endometrial (3 of 14, 21%), ovarian (5 of 30, 17%), colorectal (9 of 54, 17%), breast (2 of 14, 14%), cervical (2 of 15, 13%), and squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (1 of 11, 9%). Of the 25 patients with PIK3CA mutations, 17 (68%) were treated on a protocol that included a PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitor, and 6 (35%) achieved a partial response. In contrast, only 15 of 241 patients (6%) without documented PIK3CA mutations treated on the same protocols responded (P = 0.001). Of the 17 patients with PIK3CA mutations, 6 (35%) had simultaneous KRAS or BRAF mutations (colorectal, n = 4; ovarian, n = 2). Colorectal cancer patients with PIK3CA and KRAS mutations did not respond to therapy, whereas both ovarian cancer patients with PIK3CA and KRAS or BRAF mutations did. In conclusion, PIK3CA mutations were detected in 11.5% of patients with diverse solid tumors.

Age-targeted, less frequent but higher rates of participation in early detection of cervical, breast, and colorectal cancer will likely be prudent expenditures.The last 20 years in high-income countries, there has seen an explosion in demand and the costs of cancer drug or biologic therapy, a modest growth in some forms of radiation, yet minimal or declining surgical costs for primary disease control.

Conservative management of early stage cervical cancer: is there a role for less radical surgery?,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2011-03-01,"The utility of parametrial resection in women with early stage cervical cancer is controversial. In patients with favorable pathologic characteristics such as tumor size <2cm and the absence of lymphovascular space invasion, the rate of parametrial involvement is very low. More conservative surgical approaches have therefore been suggested. The objective of this report is to review the existing literature in this area and to describe an ongoing prospective study evaluating the safety and efficacy of conservative surgery in women with early stage cervical cancer. We performed a search of PubMed for English language articles published between 1970 and 2010 using the MeSH terms ""cervical cancer"", ""conservative surgery"", and ""cone biopsy"". Several retrospective studies have shown that <1% of patients with early stage cervical cancer with favorable pathologic characteristics have parametrial involvement. In addition, approximately 60% of patients undergoing radical trachelectomy have no residual disease in the final pathologic specimen. Recent studies have reported on the feasibility and safety of performing less radical surgery consisting of pelvic lymphadenectomy with cone biopsy, simple trachelectomy or simple hysterectomy in women with stage IA1 to IB1 cervical carcinoma. In addition, a prospective, multi-center, international trial is currently being performed to evaluate the outcomes of performing pelvic lymphadenectomy with conservative surgery (simple hysterectomy or cervical conization) in patients with favorable pathologic characteristics. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by conservative surgery is also being explored as an option for patients with larger tumors and other pathologic characteristics that do not meet the criteria to perform conservative surgery alone. The rate of parametrial involvement in women with early stage cervical cancer with favorable pathologic characteristics is low.

Vandetanib restores head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells' sensitivity to cisplatin and radiation in vivo and in vitro.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2011-02-24,"We investigated whether vandetanib, an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and rearranged during transfection (RET), could augment the antitumor activity of radiation with or without cisplatin in preclinical in vitro and in vivo models of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). OSC-19 and HN5 HNSCC cells that were cisplatin and radioresistant were treated with vandetanib, cisplatin, and radiation alone or in combination in vitro and in vivo using an orthotopic nude mouse model. Treatment effects were assessed using clonogenic survival assay, tumor volume, bioluminescence imaging, tumor growth delay, survival, microvessel density, tumor and endothelial cell apoptosis, and EGFR and Akt phosphorylation data. Vandetanib plus cisplatin radiosensitized HNSCC cells in vitro and in vivo. The combination treatment with vandetanib, cisplatin, and radiation was superior to the rest of treatments (including the double combinations) in antitumoral effects, prolonging survival, decreasing cervical lymph node metastases in vivo. It also increased both tumor and tumor-associated endothelial cell apoptosis and decreased microvessel density in vivo. An analysis of tumor growth delay data revealed that vandetanib plus cisplatin enhanced radioresponse in vivo. All vandetanib-containing treatments inhibited EGFR and Akt phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo.

This phase I trial examined safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetic parameters, and anti-tumor activity of MK-0731, a potent inhibitor of KSP. In part 1, patients with advanced solid tumors received MK-0731 intravenously over 24 h every 21 days starting at 6 mg/m(2), escalating until MTD was reached. In part 2, patients with taxane-resistant tumors received the MTD. Plasma samples were collected to analyze the pharmacokinetics of MK-0731. Tumor response was evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.0. In part 1, 21 patients (median age 63 years) were treated with MK-0731 at doses ranging from 6 to 48 mg/m(2)/24 h for median four cycles. The dose-limiting toxicity was neutropenia and the MTD was 17 mg/m(2)/24 h. At the MTD, AUC (±SD) was 10.5 (±7.3) μM × hour, clearance (±SD) was 153 mL/min (±84), and t(1/2) was 5.9 h. In part 2, 22 patients received the MTD and there were no DLTs. Although there were no objective tumor responses, four patients (with cervical, non-small cell lung, and ovarian cancers) had prolonged stable disease. MK-0731 at the MTD of 17 mg/m(2)/day every 21 days in patients with solid tumors had few grade 3 and 4 toxicities with the major DLTs at higher doses being myelosuppression. Anti-tumor efficacy was suggested by the length of stable disease in selected patients with taxane-resistant tumors.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",3227.0,35.0,The kinesin spindle protein KSP is essential for separation of spindle poles during mitosis Its inhibition results in mitotic arrest This phase I trial examined safety tolerability dose-limiting toxicity DLT maximum tolerated dose MTD pharmacokinetic parameters and anti-tumor activity of MK-0731 a potent inhibitor of KSP In part 1 patients with advanced solid tumors received MK-0731 intravenously over 24 h every 21 days starting at 6 mg/m 2 escalating until MTD was reached In part 2 patients with taxane-resistant tumors received the MTD Plasma samples were collected to analyze the pharmacokinetics of MK-0731 Tumor response was evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors RECIST v1.0 In part 1 21 patients median age 63 years were treated with MK-0731 at doses ranging from 6 to 48 mg/m 2 /24 h for median four cycles The dose-limiting toxicity was neutropenia and the MTD was 17 mg/m 2 /24 h.

Central neck dissection for papillary thyroid cancer.,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,Cancer Control,2011-04-01,"Central compartment lymph node dissection is a common adjunct to thyroidectomy in the treatment of papillary thyroid cancer. The indications, surgical technique, potential benefits, and operative risks of this procedure should be clearly defined in order to provide optimal care to these patients. A systematic review of the literature and an analysis of evidence-based recommendations were performed regarding central neck node dissection for patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma. Cervical nodal metastasis in papillary thyroid cancer is a common occurrence. The presence of metastasis is associated with increased recurrence rates and may decrease survival. Detection of central and lateral neck nodal metastasis preoperatively with clinical examination and cervical ultrasound is important in determining the appropriate initial surgical management. Level VI neck dissection and central neck dissection are terms often used interchangeably to describe surgical excision of all lymph nodes from the hyoid bone to the sternal notch between the carotid arteries, but the addition of the superior mediastinal lymph nodes in compartment VII should be included in the central neck dissection. Due to improved recurrence rates and survival, therapeutic central neck dissection is recommended for all patients with nodal involvement detected pre- or intraoperatively. Prophylactic central neck dissection in patients without detectable nodal disease remains a controversial topic due to a lack of definitive evidence of improved recurrence rates or survival and the possibility of higher complication rates compared to total thyroidectomy alone. Reoperative central nodal dissection can be a challenging procedure with increased complication rates but with good outcomes in experienced centers. Central neck lymph node dissection plays an important role in the appropriate treatment of papillary thyroid cancer at initial presentation and in cases of recurrent disease.

Despite widespread concern about the successful performance of this procedure following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACR) treatment, we hypothesized that safe and effective MIE could be performed in this setting. We reviewed our prospective database of patients undergoing MIE for esophageal cancer at our institution between January 2008 and February 2010. We analyzed the association of NACR on perioperative outcomes and compared them with those patients undergoing MIE without NACR. NACR was used in ≥T2 or N+ tumors.

Immune response in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme treated with intranodal autologous tumor lysate-dendritic cell vaccination after radiation chemotherapy.,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",J. Immunother.,2011-05-01,"Patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are profoundly immunosuppressed and may benefit from restoration of an antitumor immune response in combination with conventional radiation therapy and temozolomide (TMZ). The optimal strategies to evaluate clinically relevant immune responses to treatment have yet to be determined. The primary objective of our study was to determine immunologic response to cervical intranodal vaccination with autologous tumor lysate-loaded dendritic cells (DCs) in patients with GBM after radiation therapy and TMZ. We used a novel hierarchical clustering analysis of immune parameters measured before and after vaccination. Secondary objectives were to assess treatment feasibility and to correlate immune response with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival. Ten eligible patients received vaccination. Tumor-specific cytotoxic T-cell response measured after vaccination was enhanced for the precursor frequency of CD4+ T and CD4+ interferon γ-producing cells. Hierarchical clustering analysis of multiple functional outcomes discerned 2 groups of patients according to their immune response, and additionally showed that patients in the top quintile for at least one immune function parameter had improved survival. There were no serious adverse events related to DC vaccination. All patients were alive at 6 months after diagnosis and the 6-month PFS was 90%.

Establishing a sentinel lymph node mapping algorithm for the treatment of early cervical cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2011-05-13,"To establish an algorithm that incorporates sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping to the surgical treatment of early cervical cancer, ensuring that lymph node (LN) metastases are accurately detected but minimizing the need for complete lymphadenectomy (LND). A prospectively maintained database of all patients who underwent SLN procedure followed by a complete bilateral pelvic LND for cervical cancer (FIGO stages IA1 with LVI to IIA) from 03/2003 to 09/2010 was analyzed. The surgical algorithm we evaluated included the following: 1. SLNs are removed and submitted to ultrastaging; 2. any suspicious LN is removed regardless of mapping; 3. if only unilateral mapping is noted, a contralateral side-specific pelvic LND is performed (including inter-iliac nodes); and 4. parametrectomy en bloc with primary tumor resection is done in all cases. We retrospectively applied the algorithm to determine how it would have performed. One hundred twenty-two patients were included. Median SLN count was 3 and median total LN count was 20. At least one SLN was identified in 93% of cases (114/122), while optimal (bilateral) mapping was achieved in 75% of cases (91/122). SLN correctly diagnosed 21 of 25 patients with nodal spread. When the algorithm was applied, all patients with LN metastasis were detected; with optimal mapping, bilateral pelvic LND could have been avoided in 75% of cases.

Patient 1 underwent surgery for an adnexal mass, and pathological examination revealed gallbladder adenocarcinoma metastatic to the ovary. She had a recurrence in the right lateral abdominal wall robotic trocar site with concurrent metastases in the gallbladder fossa and liver. Patient 2 was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of unclear (cervical vs endometrial) origin. Imaging showed metastases in pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes. She underwent laparoscopy and was found intraoperatively to have gross disease on the right ovary. The patient underwent right salpingo-oophorectomy and chemoradiation. She had residual disease in the cervix and subsequently underwent robotic hysterectomy and left salpingo-oophorectomy. Pathological examination revealed endometrial cancer.

ACR appropriateness criteria® adjuvant therapy for resected squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.,Oral oncology,Oral Oncol.,2011-06-12,"Locoregional recurrence following surgical resection alone for stage III/IV head and neck cancer is common. Adjuvant radiotherapy has been shown to improve post-operative locoregional control when compared to pre-operative radiotherapy for head and neck cancers. Following surgical resection, adverse pathological features determine the need for adjuvant therapy. High-risk pathologic features include extranodal tumor spread and involved surgical margins. Other adverse pathologic features include T 3-4 tumors, perineural invasion, lymphovascular space invasion, low neck adenopathy, and multiple tumor involved cervical lymph nodes. The standard adjuvant therapies are post-operative radiation therapy or post-operative chemoradiotherapy. Post-operative chemoradiotherapy yields superior locoregional control, progression-free survival, and in some studies, overall survival compared to post-operative radiotherapy for high-risk patients in multiple randomized studies. Pooled analyses of randomized data demonstrate that post-operative concurrent chemoradiotherapy is associated with overall survival benefits for patients with involved surgical margins as well as those with extranodal tumor spread. Post-operative radiotherapy concurrent with cisplatin at 100 mg/m(2) every 21 days is the current standard chemoradiotherapy platform adjuvant head and neck cancer treatment. Post-operative radiotherapy and post-operative chemoradiotherapy radiation treatment volumes are not standardized and should be designed based on the risk of recurrence and clinically occult involvement of head and neck subsites and nodal regions.

Oncol.,2011-09-01,"The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) conducted a phase II trial to assess the efficacy and tolerability of the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab, in persistent or recurrent carcinoma of the cervix. Eligible patients had cervical cancer, measurable disease, and GOG performance status ≤2. Treatment consisted of cetuximab 400 mg/m(2) initial dose followed by 250 mg/m(2) weekly until disease progression or prohibitive toxicity. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months and response. The study used a 2-stage group sequential design. Thirty-eight patients were entered with 3 exclusions, leaving 35 evaluable for analysis. Thirty-one patients (88.6%) received prior radiation as well as either 1 (n=25, 71.4%) or 2 (n=10) prior cytotoxic regimens. Twenty-four patients (68.6%) had a squamous cell carcinoma. Grade 3 adverse events possibly related to cetuximab included dermatologic (n=5), GI (n=4), anemia (n=2), constitutional (n=3), infection (n=2), vascular (n=2), pain (n=2), and pulmonary, neurological, vomiting and metabolic (n=1 each). No clinical responses were detected. Five patients (14.3%; two-sided 90% CI, 5.8% to 30%) survived without progression for at least 6 months. The median PFS and overall survival (OS) times were 1.97 and 6.7 months, respectively. In this study, all patients with PFS at 6 months harbored tumors with squamous cell histology.

Its diagnosis requires a high level of suspicion because it is often mistaken for more common cervical or uterine corpus epithelial neoplasms. This is a 39-year-old woman who presented with a cervical mass and positive human chorionic gonadotropin and was diagnosed with both locally advanced squamous cell cervical carcinoma and nonmetastatic GTN. She was treated unsuccessfully with concurrent intravenous cisplatin plus pelvic radiation and single-agent intravenous methotrexate. A retrospective review of the cervical biopsy using immunohistochemistry as well as genotyping of the tumor changed the original diagnosis to ETT. It is known that ETT is relatively unresponsive to chemotherapy compared with most other types of GTN; therefore, surgery would have been the optimal treatment. She died despite multiple salvage chemotherapies. Malignant GTN is one of the most curable gynecologic malignancies; however, its correct diagnosis is critical for the appropriate treatment.

Cancer screening practices among Amish and non-Amish adults living in Ohio Appalachia.,The Journal of rural health : official journal of the American Rural Health Association and the National Rural Health Care Association,J Rural Health,2010-11-15,"The Amish, a unique community living in Ohio Appalachia, have lower cancer incidence rates than non-Amish living in Ohio Appalachia. The purpose of this study was to examine cancer screening rates among Amish compared to non-Amish adults living in Ohio Appalachia and a national sample of adults of the same race and ethnicity in an effort to explain cancer patterns. Face-to-face interviews focusing on perception of risk, cancer screening behaviors, and screening barriers were conducted among Amish (n = 134) and non-Amish (n = 154) adults living in Ohio Appalachia. Cancer screening rates were calculated and then compared to a national sample of adults. More Ohio Appalachia non-Amish males (35.9% vs 14.5%; P= .022) and females (33.3% vs 12.5%; P= .008) reported that they would probably develop cancer in the future compared to Amish males and females.

Application of the hybrid capture 2 assay to squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck: a convenient liquid-phase approach for the reliable determination of human papillomavirus status.,Cancer cytopathology,Cancer Cytopathol,2011-07-12,"A growing proportion of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). In light of the unique natural history and prognosis of HPV-related HNSCCs, routine HPV testing is being incorporated into diagnostic protocols. Accordingly, there is an escalating demand for an optimal detection strategy that is sensitive and specific, transferrable to the diagnostic laboratory, standardized across laboratories, cost-effective, and amenable to broad application across specimen types including cytologic preparations. Cytologic preparations (fine-needle aspirates [FNAs] and brushes) were obtained from surgically resected HNSCCs and evaluated for the presence of high-risk HPV using the Hybrid Capture 2 assay. HPV analysis was also performed on the corresponding tissue sections using HPV in situ hybridization and p16 immunohistochemistry. In cases in which the immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization results were discordant, HPV status was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction detection of E7 expression. HPV status in the tissues and corresponding cytologic samples was compared. Based on benchmark HPV testing of the tissue sections, 14 HNSCCs were classified as HPV positive and 10 as HPV negative. All corresponding cytologic preparations were correctly classified using the Hybrid Capture 2 assay. The Hybrid Capture 2 strategy, already widely used for the detection of high-risk HPV in cervical brushes, is readily transferrable to HNSCCs. Consistent accuracy in cytologic preparation suggests its potential application in FNAs from patients who present with lymph node metastases, and may eliminate the need to obtain tissue solely for the purpose of HPV testing.",Evaluation Study,3115.0,45.0,A growing proportion of head and squamous cell carcinoma HNSCC is caused by the human papillomavirus HPV In light of the unique natural history and prognosis of HPV-related HNSCCs routine HPV testing is being incorporated into diagnostic protocols Accordingly there is an escalating demand for an optimal detection strategy that is sensitive and specific transferrable to the diagnostic laboratory standardized across laboratories cost-effective and amenable to broad application across specimen types including cytologic preparations Cytologic preparations fine-needle aspirates FNAs and brushes were obtained from surgically resected HNSCCs and evaluated for the presence of high-risk HPV using the Hybrid Capture 2 assay HPV analysis was also performed on the corresponding tissue sections using HPV in situ hybridization and p16 immunohistochemistry In cases in which the immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization results were discordant HPV status was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction detection of E7 expression HPV status in the tissues and corresponding cytologic samples was compared Based on benchmark HPV testing of the tissue sections 14 HNSCCs were classified as HPV positive and 10 as HPV negative All corresponding cytologic preparations were correctly classified using the Hybrid Capture 2 assay The Hybrid Capture 2 strategy already widely used for the detection of high-risk HPV in brushes is readily transferrable to HNSCCs Consistent accuracy in cytologic preparation suggests its potential application in FNAs from patients who present with lymph node metastases and may eliminate the need to obtain tissue solely for the purpose of HPV testing,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[8, 1921, 920, 1, 718, 2, 691, 31, 134, 1209, 16, 1546, 20, 3, 171, 3242, 933, 4, 1691, 1, 3, 991, 1504, 532, 2, 356, 1, 933, 139, 9691, 1311, 933, 471, 16, 486, 2449, 237, 752, 2189, 4705, 125, 16, 35, 2922, 6645, 9, 35, 665, 638, 692, 17, 16, 745, 2, 112, 46671, 6, 3, 752, 1624, 1670, 716, 4884, 835, 323, 2, 4070, 6, 2094, 1581, 716, 2360, 630, 141, 4195, 7791, 4195, 7791, 2924, 2177, 7493, 18785, 2, 31307, 11, 683, 29, 2350, 1133, 9691, 2, 194, 9, 3, 463, 1, 64, 43, 933, 75, 3, 4542, 2891, 18, 719, 933, 65, 10, 120, 173, 23, 3, 1734, 246, 3013, 75, 933, 4, 957, 1554, 2, 1932, 888, 4, 140, 4, 92, 3, 1382, 2, 4, 957, 1554, 99, 11, 4570, 933, 156, 10, 509, 20, 1589, 98, 1451, 1260, 1329, 638, 1, 4540, 55, 933, 156, 4, 3, 742, 2, 1734, 4195, 347, 10, 72, 90, 23, 7330, 933, 471, 1, 3, 246, 3013, 213, 9691, 11, 1373, 22, 933, 109, 2, 79, 22, 933, 199, 62, 1734, 4195, 7791, 11, 4911, 1373, 75, 3, 4542, 2891, 18, 719, 3, 4542, 2891, 18, 692, 3298, 1792, 95, 9, 3, 638, 1, 64, 43, 933, 4, 31307, 16, 3860, 46671, 6, 9691, 925, 1190, 4, 4195, 4824, 844, 211, 174, 1581, 4, 18785, 29, 7, 54, 364, 5, 263, 289, 196, 2, 68, 4964, 3, 594, 6, 3140, 246, 5558, 9, 3, 743, 1, 933, 471]",1685.0,21751428,94
GRIM-19 disrupts E6/E6AP complex to rescue p53 and induce apoptosis in cervical cancers.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2011-07-12,"Our previous studies showed a down-regulation of GRIM-19 in primary human cervical cancers, and restoration of GRIM-19 induced tumor regression. The induction of tumor suppressor protein p53 ubiquitination and degradation by E6 oncoportein of high risk-HPV through forming a stable complex with E6AP is considered as a critical mechanism for cervical tumor development. The aims of this study were to determine the potential role of GRIM-19 in rescuing p53 protein and inducing cervical cancer cell apoptosis. The protein levels of GRIM-19 and p53 were detected in normal cervical tissues from 45 patients who underwent hysterectomy for reasons other than neoplasias of either the cervix or endometrium, and cervical cancer tissues from 60 patients with non-metastatic squamous epithelial carcinomas. Coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assay were performed to examine the interaction of GRIM-19 with 18E6 and E6AP in vivo and in vitro respectively. The competition of 18E6 with E6AP in binding GRIM-19 by performing competition pull-down assays was designed to examine the disruption of E6/E6AP complex by GRIM-19. The augment of E6AP ubiquitination by GRIM-19 was detected in vivo and in vitro ubiquitination assay. The effects of GRIM-19-dependent p53 accumulation on cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis were explored by MTT, flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy respectively. The tumor suppression was detected by xenograft mouse model. The levels of GRIM-19 and p53 were concurrently down regulated in cervical cancers. The restoration of GRIM-19 can induce ubiquitination and degradation of E6AP, and disrupt the E6/E6AP complex through the interaction of N-terminus of GRIM-19 with both E6 and E6AP, which protected p53 from degradation and promoted cell apoptosis.

Risk of occult malignancy in morcellated hysterectomy: a case series.,International journal of gynecological pathology : official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Pathologists,Int. J. Gynecol. Pathol.,2011-09-01,"Uterine morcellation is performed only when significant neoplasia is not anticipated. In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of unexpected pathology in a series of low-risk morcellated hysterectomies. We reviewed a series consisting of all patients undergoing hysterectomy with morcellation at a tertiary-care hospital over a 4-yr period (n=101). Patient records were reviewed to retrieve demographics, details of preoperative evaluation (Pap smear, endometrial biopsy, imaging), and surgical pathology diagnoses. The median number of blocks submitted for histology was 6. On final pathology, endometrium was detected in 99% of all cases. No endometrial, myometrial, or cervical neoplasia other than leiomyoma (numerous cases) was present in the morcellated uteri, but in 1 case an atypical trophoblastic nodule with necrosis and myometrial infiltration, suspected to represent epithelioid trophoblastic tumor, was inadvertently morcellated. From this series, the prospective risk of occult malignancy in a low-risk population undergoing morcellation is estimated at 1% (95% confidence interval, <0.01%-5.94%). A subgroup analysis of patients who participated in what we propose as a complete preoperative workup, consisting of nonconcerning Pap smear, endometrial biopsy, and ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, showed no significant findings on final histology.

CD4+ T-cell response against human papillomavirus type 16 E6 protein is associated with a favorable clinical trend.,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",Cancer Immunol. Immunother.,2011-08-13,"The association between the CD8+ T-cell responses to human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E6 protein and a favorable clinical trend has been demonstrated previously. The roles of human papillomavirus (HPV)-specific CD4+ T-cell responses and of regulatory T-cells (Tregs) were examined. Subjects with a recent history of abnormal Papanicolaou smear were eligible, and colposcopy-guided biopsy was performed at enrollment. Interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay and fluorescent-activated cell sorter analysis to measure the frequencies of Tregs were performed. Subjects with histological diagnoses of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1, 2, or 3 were considered to have short-term persistence of cervical abnormality and were called ""persistors"" (n = 51) while those of normal histology were designated to be ""regressors"" (n = 33). A significantly higher percentage CD4+ T-cell response was detected in the regressors (15/33 or 45.5%) compared with the persistors (10/51 or 19.6%) (P = .015) for the E6 peptides but not for the E7 peptides. The CD4+ responses to certain E6 regions [E6(16-40), E6(91-115), E6(106-130), and E6(136-158)] were also significantly higher in the regressors.

Cells from each of 48 HNSCC cell lines were orthotopically injected into the oral tongues of nude mice. Tumor volume, cervical lymph node metastasis, and mouse survival were recorded. Direct sequencing of the TP53 gene and Western blot analysis for the p53 protein after induction with 5-fluorouracil was conducted. Cell lines were categorized as either mutant TP53 or wild-type TP53, and lines with TP53 mutation were further categorized on the basis of type of mutation (disruptive or nondisruptive) and level of p53 protein expression. The behavior of tumors in these different groups was compared. These 48 HNSCC cell lines showed a wide range of behavior from highly aggressive and metastatic to no tumor formation. Mice injected with cells harboring disruptive TP53 mutations had faster tumor growth, greater incidence of cervical lymph node metastasis, and shorter survival than mice injected with cells lacking these mutations. HNSCC cell lines display a wide spectrum of behavior in an orthotopic model of oral cancer.

The role of frozen section in surgical staging of low risk endometrial cancer.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2011-09-01,"The role of frozen section (FS) in intraoperative decision making for surgical staging of endometrial cancer is controversial. Objective of this study is to assess the agreement rate between the FS and paraffin section (PS); and the potential impact of the role of FS in the intra-operative decision making for the complete surgical staging in low risk endometrial cancer. This is a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with intra-operative FS stage I, grade I or II endometrial cancer from 1995-2004. FS results were compared with final pathology results with regard to tumor grade, depth of myometrial invasion, cervical involvement, lymphovascular invasion, and lymph node involvement. Agreement statistic with kappa was calculated using SPSS statistical software. Categorical variables were tested using chi-square test with p value of ≤0.05 being statistically significant. Of the 457 patients with endometrial cancer, 146 were evaluated by intra-operative FS and met inclusion criteria. FS results were in disagreement with permanent section in 35% for the grade (kappa 0.58, p = 0.003), 28% for depth of myometrial invasion (kappa 0.61, p<0.0001), 13% for cervical involvement (kappa 0.78, p = 0.002), and 32% for lymphovascular invasion (kappa 0.6, p = 0.01). Permanent pathology upstaged 31.9% & 23.2% of FS stage IA, & IB specimen respectively. Lymph node dissection was done in 56.8%. Lymph node metastasis was identified in 8.4%.

Eugenol enhances the chemotherapeutic potential of gemcitabine and induces anticarcinogenic and anti-inflammatory activity in human cervical cancer cells.,Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals,Cancer Biother. Radiopharm.,2011-09-22,"Administration of natural or synthetic agents to inhibit, delay, block, or reverse the initiation and promotional events associated with carcinogenesis opens a new avenue for cancer prevention and treatment to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality. Eugenol, a potential chemopreventive agent, is a component of clove and several other spices such as basil, cinnamon, and bay leaves. A number of reports have shown that eugenol possesses antiseptic, analgesic, antibacterial, and anticancer properties. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the chemopreventive potential of eugenol alone and in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent such as gemcitabine. Eugenol showed dose-dependent selective cytotoxicity toward HeLa cells in comparison to normal cells, pointing to its safe cytotoxicity profile. A combination of eugenol and gemcitabine induced growth inhibition and apoptosis at lower concentrations, compared with the individual drugs. The analysis of the data using a combination index showed combination index values of <1 indicating strong synergistic interaction. The combination thus may enhance the efficacy of gemcitabine at lower doses and minimize the toxicity on normal cells. In addition, the expression analysis of genes involved in apoptosis and inflammation revealed significant downregulation of Bcl-2, COX-2, and IL-1β on treatment with eugenol. Thus, the results suggest that eugenol exerts its anticancer activities via apoptosis induction and anti-inflammatory properties and also provide the first evidence demonstrating synergism between eugenol and gemcitabine, which may enhance the therapeutic index of prevention and/or treatment of cervical cancer.",Journal Article,3043.0,49.0,Administration of natural or synthetic agents to inhibit delay block or reverse the initiation and promotional events associated with carcinogenesis opens a new avenue for cancer prevention and treatment to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality Eugenol a potential chemopreventive agent is a component of clove and several other spices such as basil cinnamon and bay leaves A number of reports have shown that eugenol possesses antiseptic analgesic antibacterial and anticancer properties The present study was undertaken to evaluate the chemopreventive potential of eugenol alone and in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent such as gemcitabine Eugenol showed dose-dependent selective cytotoxicity toward HeLa cells in comparison to normal cells pointing to its safe cytotoxicity profile A combination of eugenol and gemcitabine induced growth inhibition and apoptosis at lower concentrations compared with the individual drugs The analysis of the data using a combination index showed combination index values of 1 indicating strong synergistic interaction The combination thus may enhance the efficacy of gemcitabine at lower doses and minimize the toxicity on normal cells In addition the expression analysis of genes involved in apoptosis and inflammation revealed significant downregulation of Bcl-2 COX-2 and IL-1β on treatment with eugenol Thus the results suggest that eugenol exerts its anticancer activities via apoptosis induction and anti-inflammatory properties and also provide the first evidence demonstrating synergism between eugenol and gemcitabine which may enhance the therapeutic index of prevention and/or treatment of cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[634, 1, 1504, 15, 3273, 183, 6, 1433, 1984, 2381, 15, 1772, 3, 1118, 2, 23743, 281, 41, 5, 1719, 12701, 8, 217, 10537, 9, 12, 1070, 2, 24, 6, 969, 12, 787, 2, 282, 20743, 8, 174, 4401, 420, 16, 8, 1249, 1, 46783, 2, 392, 127, 60579, 225, 22, 60580, 60581, 2, 7444, 15229, 8, 207, 1, 1198, 47, 443, 17, 20743, 9857, 35202, 5954, 15002, 2, 1475, 1571, 3, 364, 45, 10, 2789, 6, 376, 3, 4401, 174, 1, 20743, 279, 2, 4, 150, 5, 8, 1573, 420, 225, 22, 679, 20743, 224, 61, 470, 1094, 1408, 1317, 8466, 37, 4, 1155, 6, 295, 37, 11548, 6, 211, 1165, 1408, 800, 8, 150, 1, 20743, 2, 679, 277, 129, 297, 2, 351, 28, 280, 1003, 72, 5, 3, 797, 600, 3, 65, 1, 3, 74, 75, 8, 150, 558, 224, 150, 558, 1030, 1, 14, 1716, 1082, 1806, 915, 3, 150, 631, 68, 1304, 3, 209, 1, 679, 28, 280, 415, 2, 3241, 3, 155, 23, 295, 37, 4, 352, 3, 55, 65, 1, 214, 646, 4, 351, 2, 1815, 553, 93, 2475, 1, 1044, 18, 418, 18, 2, 501, 8215, 23, 24, 5, 20743, 631, 3, 99, 309, 17, 20743, 5685, 211, 1475, 2042, 847, 351, 504, 2, 312, 1291, 1571, 2, 120, 377, 3, 157, 241, 2219, 6494, 59, 20743, 2, 679, 92, 68, 1304, 3, 189, 558, 1, 1070, 2, 15, 24, 1, 12]",1652.0,21939359,52

Oncol.,2011-10-27,"To compare the open versus robotic surgical approaches and provide surgical outcome data on patients who have undergone radical trachelectomy (RT). We identified patients who underwent open (ORT) or robotic radical trachelectomy (RRT) between September 2005 and June 2011. Tumor characteristics, perioperative, operative and obstetrical outcomes were analyzed. Thirty-seven patients with early stage cervical cancer that desired future fertility underwent attempted radical trachelectomy, and 32 patients (20 with 1B1, 11 with 1A2, and 5 with 1A1 with LVSI/poorly differentiated histology) had successful completion of RT. Five (1 open/4 robotic) underwent conversion to radical hysterectomy secondary to close (<5mm) endocervical margin (p=0.08). The median age at diagnosis was 28.9 years (range; 21.4-37.2), 70% were nulliparous, and 9 had a visible lesion. Twenty-five patients (68%) underwent ORT and 12 (32%) underwent RRT. RRT was associated with less blood loss (62.5 mL vs. 300 mL, p=0.0001) and decreased length of postoperative stay (1 vs. 4 days, p<0.001), with no difference in operative time or histopathologic outcomes. Twenty-three patients (62%) had no residual cervical disease on final pathology. Common long-term morbidities were irregular menstrual bleeding or amenorrhea (25%), cerclage erosion (13%), or cervical stenosis (9%). Although there was a higher rate of conversion to hysterectomy in the robotic surgery cohort, rates of serious morbidities among the cohorts were comparable (robotic: 33% vs. open: 24%, p=0.70).

Sensitivity of Raman spectroscopy to normal patient variability.,Journal of biomedical optics,J Biomed Opt,2011-11-01,"Many groups have used Raman spectroscopy for diagnosing cervical dysplasia; however, there have been few studies looking at the effect of normal physiological variations on Raman spectra. We assess four patient variables that may affect normal Raman spectra: Race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), parity, and socioeconomic status. Raman spectra were acquired from a diverse population of 75 patients undergoing routine screening for cervical dysplasia. Classification of Raman spectra from patients with a normal cervix is performed using sparse multinomial logistic regression (SMLR) to determine if any of these variables has a significant effect. Results suggest that BMI and parity have the greatest impact, whereas race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status have a limited effect.

"Characterization of NOL7 gene point mutations, promoter methylation, and protein expression in cervical cancer.",International journal of gynecological pathology : official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Pathologists,Int. J. Gynecol. Pathol.,2012-01-01,"NOL7 is a putative tumor suppressor gene localized to 6p23, a region with frequent loss of heterozygosity in a number of cancers, including cervical cancer (CC). We have previously demonstrated that reintroduction of NOL7 into CC cells altered the angiogenic phenotype and suppressed tumor growth in vivo by 95%. Therefore, to understand its mechanism of inactivation in CC, we investigated the genetic and epigenetic regulation of NOL7. NOL7 mRNA and protein levels were assessed in 13 CC cell lines and 23 consecutive CC specimens by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Methylation of the NOL7 promoter was analyzed by bisulfite sequencing and mutations were identified through direct sequencing. A CpG island with multiple CpG dinucleotides spanned the 5' untranslated region and first exon of NOL7. However, bisulfite sequencing failed to identify persistent sites of methylation. Mutational sequencing revealed that 40% of the CC specimens and 31% of the CC cell lines harbored somatic mutations that may affect the in vivo function of NOL7. Endogenous NOL7 mRNA and protein expression in CC cell lines were significantly decreased in 46% of the CC cell lines. Finally, immunohistochemistry demonstrated strong NOL7 nucleolar staining in normal tissues that decreased with histologic progression toward CC. NOL7 is inactivated in CC in accordance with the Knudson 2-hit hypothesis through loss of heterozygosity and mutation. Together with evidence of its in vivo tumor suppression, these data support the hypothesis that NOL7 is the legitimate tumor suppressor gene located on 6p23.",Journal Article,2942.0,6.0,NOL7 is a putative tumor suppressor gene localized to 6p23 a region with frequent loss of heterozygosity in a number of cancers including cancer CC We have previously demonstrated that reintroduction of NOL7 into CC cells altered the angiogenic phenotype and suppressed tumor growth in vivo by 95 Therefore to understand its mechanism of inactivation in CC we investigated the genetic and epigenetic regulation of NOL7 NOL7 mRNA and protein levels were assessed in 13 CC cell lines and 23 consecutive CC specimens by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction western blotting and immunohistochemistry Methylation of the NOL7 promoter was analyzed by bisulfite sequencing and mutations were identified through direct sequencing A CpG island with multiple CpG dinucleotides spanned the 5 untranslated region and first exon of NOL7 However bisulfite sequencing failed to identify persistent sites of methylation Mutational sequencing revealed that 40 of the CC specimens and 31 of the CC cell lines harbored somatic mutations that may affect the in vivo function of NOL7 Endogenous NOL7 mRNA and protein expression in CC cell lines were significantly decreased in 46 of the CC cell lines Finally immunohistochemistry demonstrated strong NOL7 nucleolar staining in normal tissues that decreased with histologic progression toward CC NOL7 is inactivated in CC in accordance with the Knudson 2-hit hypothesis through loss of heterozygosity and mutation Together with evidence of its in vivo tumor suppression these data support the hypothesis that NOL7 is the legitimate tumor suppressor gene located on 6p23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[21694, 16, 8, 2743, 30, 1245, 145, 909, 6, 39827, 8, 1053, 5, 908, 407, 1, 3963, 4, 8, 207, 1, 163, 141, 12, 1951, 21, 47, 373, 264, 17, 14721, 1, 21694, 237, 1951, 37, 1495, 3, 2068, 1005, 2, 1908, 30, 129, 4, 386, 20, 48, 673, 6, 1640, 211, 670, 1, 2297, 4, 1951, 21, 565, 3, 336, 2, 1418, 863, 1, 21694, 21694, 956, 2, 178, 148, 11, 275, 4, 233, 1951, 31, 285, 2, 382, 935, 1951, 623, 20, 1589, 98, 1156, 1451, 1260, 1329, 1521, 3661, 2, 888, 569, 1, 3, 21694, 973, 10, 311, 20, 6181, 615, 2, 138, 11, 108, 298, 1196, 615, 8, 2075, 3454, 5, 232, 2075, 21270, 16363, 3, 33, 7379, 1053, 2, 157, 1725, 1, 21694, 137, 6181, 615, 1551, 6, 255, 1882, 633, 1, 569, 1619, 615, 553, 17, 327, 1, 3, 1951, 623, 2, 456, 1, 3, 1951, 31, 285, 3253, 1119, 138, 17, 68, 1158, 3, 4, 386, 343, 1, 21694, 2682, 21694, 956, 2, 178, 55, 4, 1951, 31, 285, 11, 97, 340, 4, 641, 1, 3, 1951, 31, 285, 1368, 888, 264, 1082, 21694, 11328, 1029, 4, 295, 742, 17, 340, 5, 884, 91, 1317, 1951, 21694, 16, 5458, 4, 1951, 4, 8934, 5, 3, 46905, 18, 6519, 1492, 298, 407, 1, 3963, 2, 258, 1162, 5, 241, 1, 211, 4, 386, 30, 1332, 46, 74, 538, 3, 1492, 17, 21694, 16, 3, 23149, 30, 1245, 145, 2308, 23, 39827]",1609.0,22123719,236

WAI was randomly allocated to 202 and AP to 194 eligible patients. CSI (n=93 total) was associated with a 44% increase in risk of progression and a 33% increase in risk of death. There was a trend for increasing number PPN being associated with a 7% per positive node increase in risk of progression/death. For CSI, the estimated unadjusted treatment hazard ratios (HRs) were: PFS 0.85 (0.53, 1.38); OS 0.81 (0.50, 1.33). For metastatic disease limited to a single PPN (n=25), the unadjusted HRs were: PFS 0.96 (0.34, 2.74); OS 0.73 (0.24, 2.18). The test of homogeneity of treatment effect (ie., AP vs WAI) across subgroups (CSI, number of positive pelvic nodes) was not statistically significant for either endpoint, thus supporting the superiority of chemotherapy as reported in the original manuscript.

Oncol.,2011-12-22,"To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and acute dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of intravenous topotecan administered with weekly cisplatin during pelvic radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer. Patients were treated at one of two dose levels receiving intravenous topotecan at 0.5mg/m(2) and cisplatin at either 30 or 40 mg/m(2) given weekly for 6 weeks concurrently with pelvic radiation and intracavitary brachytherapy. The primary endpoint for the escalation study was acute dose-limiting toxicities occurring within 30 days of completing radiation therapy. Eleven patients were enrolled. Dose-limiting toxicity consisting of Grade 3 nausea and vomiting lasting >24h in one patient and grade 3 febrile neutropenia in another patient occurred at the first dose level of weekly topotecan 0.5mg/m(2) and cisplatin 40 mg/m(2).

Pocket proteins suppress head and neck cancer.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2012-01-11,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) is a common cancer in humans long known to be caused by tobacco and alcohol use, but now an increasing percentage of HNSCC is recognized to be caused by the same human papillomaviruses (HPV) that cause cervical and other anogenital cancers. HPV-positive HNSCCs differ remarkably from HPV-negative HNSCCs in their clinical response and molecular properties. From studies in mice, we know that E7 is the dominant HPV oncoprotein in head and neck cancer. E7 is best known for its ability to inactivate pRb, the product of the retinoblastoma tumor susceptibility gene. However, loss of pRb function does not fully account for potency of E7 in causing head and neck cancer. In this study, we characterized the cancer susceptibility of mice deficient in the expression of pRb and either of two related ""pocket"" proteins, p107 and p130, that are also inactivated by E7. pRb/p107-deficient mice developed head and neck cancer as frequently as do HPV-16 E7 transgenic mice. The head and neck epithelia of the pRb/p107-deficient mice also displayed the same acute phenotypes and biomarker readouts as observed in the epithelia of E7 transgenic mice. Mice deficient for pRb and p130 in their head and neck epithelia showed intermediate acute and tumor phenotypes. We conclude that pRb and p107 act together to efficiently suppress head and neck cancer and are, therefore, highly relevant targets of HPV-16 E7 in its contribution to HPV-positive HNSCC.",Journal Article,2932.0,15.0,Head and squamous cell carcinomas HNSCC is a common cancer in humans long known to be caused by tobacco and alcohol use but now an increasing percentage of HNSCC is recognized to be caused by the same human papillomaviruses HPV that cause and other anogenital cancers HPV-positive HNSCCs differ remarkably from HPV-negative HNSCCs in their clinical response and molecular properties From studies in mice we know that E7 is the dominant HPV oncoprotein in head and cancer E7 is best known for its ability to inactivate pRb the product of the tumor susceptibility gene However loss of pRb function does not fully account for potency of E7 in causing head and cancer In this study we characterized the cancer susceptibility of mice deficient in the expression of pRb and either of two related `` pocket '' proteins p107 and p130 that are also inactivated by E7 pRb/p107-deficient mice developed head and cancer as frequently as do HPV-16 E7 transgenic mice The head and epithelia of the pRb/p107-deficient mice also displayed the same acute phenotypes and biomarker readouts as observed in the epithelia of E7 transgenic mice Mice deficient for pRb and p130 in their head and epithelia showed intermediate acute and tumor phenotypes We conclude that pRb and p107 act together to efficiently suppress head and cancer and are therefore highly relevant targets of HPV-16 E7 in its contribution to HPV-positive HNSCC,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[718, 2, 691, 31, 826, 1209, 16, 8, 186, 12, 4, 3218, 319, 440, 6, 40, 1546, 20, 2607, 2, 2197, 119, 84, 1134, 35, 602, 1150, 1, 1209, 16, 1904, 6, 40, 1546, 20, 3, 827, 171, 14731, 933, 17, 708, 2, 127, 13836, 163, 933, 109, 9691, 1505, 4856, 29, 933, 199, 9691, 4, 136, 38, 51, 2, 219, 1571, 29, 94, 4, 399, 21, 6572, 17, 4540, 16, 3, 2156, 933, 6159, 4, 718, 2, 12, 4540, 16, 824, 440, 9, 211, 801, 6, 13772, 8734, 3, 2821, 1, 3, 30, 1432, 145, 137, 407, 1, 8734, 343, 1097, 44, 1910, 1967, 9, 3593, 1, 4540, 4, 3440, 718, 2, 12, 4, 26, 45, 21, 765, 3, 12, 1432, 1, 399, 1971, 4, 3, 55, 1, 8734, 2, 361, 1, 100, 139, 6575, 522, 652, 16865, 2, 15206, 17, 32, 120, 5458, 20, 4540, 8734, 16865, 1971, 399, 276, 718, 2, 12, 22, 746, 22, 1022, 933, 245, 4540, 2862, 399, 3, 718, 2, 7743, 1, 3, 8734, 16865, 1971, 399, 120, 2507, 3, 827, 286, 2618, 2, 901, 19040, 22, 164, 4, 3, 7743, 1, 4540, 2862, 399, 399, 1971, 9, 8734, 2, 15206, 4, 136, 718, 2, 7743, 224, 919, 286, 2, 30, 2618, 21, 2060, 17, 8734, 2, 16865, 2559, 1162, 6, 4143, 3134, 718, 2, 12, 2, 32, 673, 561, 867, 637, 1, 933, 245, 4540, 4, 211, 2925, 6, 933, 109, 1209]",1409.0,22237625,309
Short hairpin RNA targeting Twist1 suppresses cell proliferation and             improves chemosensitivity to cisplatin in HeLa human cervical cancer cells.,Oncology reports,Oncol. Rep.,2012-01-12,"Development of multidrug resistance (MDR) remains a major hurdle to successful cancer chemotherapy and MDR1/P-gp overexpression is believed to be mainly responsible for MDR of tumor cells. Twist1, which is a highly conserved transcription factor that belongs to the family of basic helix-loop-helix proteins, has been shown to be a major regulator of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and therefore promotes carcinoma metastasis. Recently, a novel function of Twist1 was reported to confer radioresistance or chemoresistance in cervical cancer. However, mechanisms of such efficacy are not completely elucidated. In the present study, we firstly analyzed the relationship between Twist1 and MDR1/P-gp expression in human cervical cancer specimens and demonstrated a positive correlation between Twist1 and MDR1/P-gp expression in the same patient. Additionally, we provide the first evidence that silencing of Twist1 by RNAi downregulated MDR1/P-gp expression in HeLa cervical cancer cells, suppressed the cell proliferation, inhibited Rhodamine123 efflux activity of cells and sensitized cells to cisplatin treatment. Collectively, these ﬁndings suggest that Twist1-mediated modulation of MDR1/P-gp expression plays an important role in sensitization of cervical cancer cells to cisplatin, and also indicate a novel therapeutic strategy to overcome drug resistance through inactivation of Twist1 expression in cervical cancer.",Journal Article,2931.0,34.0,Development of multidrug resistance MDR remains a major hurdle to successful cancer chemotherapy and MDR1/P-gp overexpression is believed to be mainly responsible for MDR of tumor cells Twist1 which is a highly conserved transcription factor that belongs to the family of basic helix-loop-helix proteins has been shown to be a major regulator of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition EMT and therefore promotes carcinoma metastasis Recently a novel function of Twist1 was reported to confer radioresistance or chemoresistance in cancer However mechanisms of such efficacy are not completely elucidated In the present study we firstly analyzed the relationship between Twist1 and MDR1/P-gp expression in human cancer specimens and demonstrated a positive correlation between Twist1 and MDR1/P-gp expression in the same patient Additionally we provide the first evidence that silencing of Twist1 by RNAi downregulated MDR1/P-gp expression in HeLa cancer cells suppressed the cell proliferation inhibited Rhodamine123 efflux activity of cells and sensitized cells to cisplatin treatment Collectively these ﬁndings suggest that Twist1-mediated modulation of MDR1/P-gp expression plays an important role in sensitization of cancer cells to cisplatin and also indicate a novel therapeutic strategy to overcome drug resistance through inactivation of Twist1 expression in cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[193, 1, 4814, 251, 4186, 469, 8, 458, 14232, 6, 1401, 12, 56, 2, 5921, 19, 5407, 851, 16, 3979, 6, 40, 2615, 2327, 9, 4186, 1, 30, 37, 5446, 92, 16, 8, 561, 5547, 866, 161, 17, 14815, 6, 3, 607, 1, 2795, 8861, 4432, 8861, 652, 71, 85, 443, 6, 40, 8, 458, 2452, 1, 3, 701, 1569, 1970, 2208, 2, 673, 2148, 134, 278, 761, 8, 229, 343, 1, 5446, 10, 210, 6, 2913, 7052, 15, 3782, 4, 12, 137, 483, 1, 225, 209, 32, 44, 2500, 3901, 4, 3, 364, 45, 21, 16535, 311, 3, 858, 59, 5446, 2, 5921, 19, 5407, 55, 4, 171, 12, 623, 2, 264, 8, 109, 816, 59, 5446, 2, 5921, 19, 5407, 55, 4, 3, 827, 69, 1724, 21, 377, 3, 157, 241, 17, 2077, 1, 5446, 20, 5881, 3315, 5921, 19, 5407, 55, 4, 8466, 12, 37, 1908, 3, 31, 457, 879, 60992, 7043, 128, 1, 37, 2, 4242, 37, 6, 540, 24, 2535, 46, 46986, 309, 17, 5446, 517, 2356, 1, 5921, 19, 5407, 55, 1698, 35, 305, 200, 4, 6272, 1, 12, 37, 6, 540, 2, 120, 1008, 8, 229, 189, 692, 6, 1768, 234, 251, 298, 2297, 1, 5446, 55, 4, 12]",1371.0,22245869,497
Clinical and pathological heterogeneity of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2012-01-13,"Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3), the immediate cervical cancer precursor, is a target of cervical cancer prevention. However, less than half of CIN3s will progress to cancer. Routine treatment of all CIN3s and the majority of CIN2s may lead to overtreatment of many lesions that would not progress. To improve our understanding of CIN3 natural history, we performed a detailed characterization of CIN3 heterogeneity in a large referral population in the US. We examined 309 CIN3 cases in the SUCCEED, a large population-based study of women with abnormal cervical cancer screening results. Histology information for 12 individual loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) segments was evaluated for each woman. We performed case-case comparisons of CIN3s to analyze determinants of heterogeneity and screening test performance. CIN3 cases varied substantially by size (1-10 LEEP segments) and by presentation with concomitant CIN2 and CIN1. All grades of CINs were equally distributed over the cervical surface. In half of the women, CIN3 lesions were found as multiple distinct lesions on the cervix. Women with large and solitary CIN3 lesions were more likely to be older, have longer sexual activity span, and have fewer multiple high risk HPV infections. Screening frequency, but not HPV16 positivity, was an important predictor of CIN3 size. Large CIN3 lesions were also characterized by high-grade clinical test results.

Furthermore, aberrant cervical thymic tissue is an infrequently reported cause of neck masses, and especially for pediatric patients. However, according to clinical work, it should be included in the differential diagnosis of neck masses, particularly for children patients. Thymic tissue rests can be found all along the route of thymic descent from the neck into the anterior mediastinum. In routine practice, the preoperative diagnosis of ectopic cervical thymus is seldom considered and it is often misdiagnosed as a possible tumor or as a lymph node, which leads to biopsy or surgical removal.

Optimized planning target volume for intact cervical cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-01-21,"To model interfraction clinical target volume (CTV) variation in patients with intact cervical cancer and design a planning target volume (PTV) that minimizes normal tissue dose while maximizing CTV coverage. We analyzed 50 patients undergoing external-beam radiotherapy for intact cervical cancer using daily online cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). The CBCTs (n = 972) for each patient were rigidly registered to the planning CT. The CTV was delineated on the planning CT (CTV(0)) and the set of CBCTs ({CTV(1)-CTV(25)}). Manual (n = 98) and automated (n = 668) landmarks were placed over the surface of CTV(0) with reference to defined anatomic structures. Normal vectors were extended from each landmark, and the minimum length required for a given probability of encompassing CTV(1)-CTV(25) was computed. The resulting expansions were used to generate an optimized PTV. The mean (SD; range) normal vector length to ensure 95% coverage was 4.3 mm (2.7 mm; 1-16 mm). The uniform expansion required to ensure 95% probability of CTV coverage was 13 mm. An anisotropic margin of 20 mm anteriorly and posteriorly and 10 mm superiorly, inferiorly, and laterally also would have ensured a 95% probability of CTV coverage. The volume of the 95% optimized PTV (1470 cm(3)) was significantly lower than both the anisotropic PTV (2220 cm(3)) and the uniformly expanded PTV (2110 cm(3)) (p < 0.001). For a 95% probability of CTV coverage, normal lengths of 1-3 mm were found along the superior and lateral regions of CTV(0), 5-10 mm along the interfaces of CTV(0) with the bladder and rectum, and 10-14 mm along the anterior surface of CTV(0) at the level of the uterus. Optimizing PTV definition according to surface landmarking resulted in a high probability of CTV coverage with reduced PTV volumes.

Correlation between radiation dose to ¹⁸F-FDG-PET defined active bone marrow subregions and acute hematologic toxicity in cervical cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-01-21,"To test the hypothesis that radiation dose to (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET)-defined active bone marrow (BM(ACT)) subregions is correlated with hematologic toxicity in cervical cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy. The conditions of 26 women with cervical cancer who underwent (18)F-FDG-PET before treatment with concurrent cisplatin and intensity-modulated radiation therapy were analyzed. BM(ACT) was defined as the subregion of total bone marrow (BM(TOT)) with a standardized uptake value (SUV) equal to or above the mean for that individual. Inactive bone marrow (BM(INACT)) was defined as BM(TOT) - BM(ACT). Generalized linear modeling was used to test the correlation between BM(ACT) and BM(INACT) dose-volume metrics and hematologic nadirs, particularly white blood cell count (WBC) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC). Increased BM(ACT) mean dose was significantly associated with decreased log(WBC) nadir (β = -0.04; 95% CI, -0.07 to -0.01; p = 0.009), decreased log(ANC) nadir (β = -0.05; 95% CI, -0.08 to -0.02; p = 0.006), decreased hemoglobin nadir (β = -0.16; 95% CI, -0.27 to -0.05; p = 0.010), and decreased platelet nadir (β = -6.16; 95% CI, -9.37 to -2.96; p < 0.001).

Merkel cell carcinoma of unknown primary origin.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2012-01-21,"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare neuroendocrine tumor of the skin. MCC from an unknown primary origin (MCCUP) can present a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. We describe our single-institution experience with the diagnosis and management of MCCUP presenting as metastases to lymph nodes. After institutional review board approval, our institutional database spanning the years 1998-2010 was queried for patients with MCCUP. Clinicopathologic variables and outcomes were assessed. From a database of 321 patients with MCC, 38 (12%) were identified as having nodal MCCUP. Median age was 67 years, and 79% were men. Nodal basins involved at presentation were cervical (58%), axillary/epitrochlear (21%), or inguinal/iliac (21%). CK20 staining was positive in 93% of tumors tested, and all were negative for thyroid transcription factor-1. Twenty-nine patients (76%) underwent complete regional lymph node dissection (LND): 3 had LND alone, ten had LND and adjuvant radiotherapy, and 16 underwent LND followed by chemoradiotherapy. Definitive chemoradiotherapy without surgery was provided to six patients (16%), while radiotherapy alone was provided to three (8%). Recurrence was observed in 34% of patients. Median recurrence-free survival was 35 months. Ten patients (26%) died, five of disease and five of other causes. The median overall survival was 104 months. Nodal MCCUP is a rare disease affecting primarily elderly white men.

PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors in patients with breast and gynecologic malignancies harboring PIK3CA mutations.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2012-01-23,"Mutations of the PIK3CA gene may predict response to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. Concomitant mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway may mediate resistance. Tumors from patients with breast, cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancer referred to the Clinical Center for Targeted Therapy (Phase I Program) were analyzed for PIK3CA, KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutations. Patients with PIK3CA mutations were treated, whenever feasible, with agents targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Of 140 patients analyzed, 25 (18%) had PIK3CA mutations, including five of 14 patients with squamous cell cervical, seven of 29 patients with endometrial, six of 29 patients with breast, and seven of 60 patients with ovarian cancers. Of the 25 patients with PIK3CA mutations, 23 (median of two prior therapies) were treated on a protocol that included a PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitor. Two (9%) of 23 patients had stable disease for more than 6 months, and seven patients (30%) had a partial response. In comparison, only seven (10%) of 70 patients with the same disease types but with wild-type PIK3CA treated on the same protocols responded (P = .04). Seven patients (30%) with PIK3CA mutations had coexisting MAPK pathway (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF) mutations (ovarian cancer, n = 5; endometrial cancer, n = 2), and two of these patients (ovarian cancer) achieved a response. PIK3CA mutations were detected in 18% of tested patients. Patients with PIK3CA mutations treated with PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors demonstrated a higher response rate than patients without mutations.

Quality of life and survival in advanced cervical cancer: a Gynecologic Oncology Group study.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2012-02-01,"To determine associations between pretreatment health-related quality of life subscales with progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in advanced and recurrent cervical cancer. Patients included those participating in Gynecologic Oncology Group advanced or recurrent cervical cancer phase III treatment trials who completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for patients with cervical cancer (FACT-Cx) and a single-item pain scale at study entry. The FACT-Cx includes five domains: physical (PWB), emotional (EWB), social (SWB), functional well being (FWB), and cervix cancer subscale (CCS). A high quality of life (QoL) score reflects better QoL. After stratifying by protocol and adjusting for patient and disease characteristics, a Cox proportional hazards model was fitted for each subscale as a continuous variable. If statistically significant, (p<0.05), an analysis on mean item scores (MIS) was performed. Nine-hundred-ninety-one patients were enrolled from 1997 to 2007. The majority (87%) had recurrent disease.

Genetic variation in RTN4 3'-UTR and susceptibility to cervical squamous cell carcinoma.,DNA and cell biology,DNA Cell Biol.,2012-02-09,"Recent studies have suggested that RTN4 is a multifunctional gene, including inhibition of axonal regeneration, vascular remodeling, apoptosis, and tumor suppression. The TATC and CAA insertion/deletion polymorphisms of RTN4 3'-UTR have been linked to schizophrenia, depression, and dilated cardiomyopathy. To test whether these two polymorphisms are associated with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), in this research, by using polymerase chain reaction-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we determined the genotypes of the TATC and CAA polymorphisms in 336 CSCC patients and 450 unrelated control subjects. Allele frequencies of TATC and CAA polymorphisms were not significantly different between CSCC patients and control subjects (odds ratio [OR]=1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.98-1.50 for TATC; OR=0.95, 95% CI=0.76-1.18 for CAA). Decreased CSCC risk was associated with TATC polymorphism in a recessive model (OR=0.49, 95% CI=0.30-0.77), while no significant association was observed between CAA polymorphism and CSCC in different genetic models. Results of stratified analysis revealed that both TATC and CAA polymorphisms were associated with high clinical stage, and CAA polymorphism was also associated with positive parametrial invasion (OR=0.69, 95% CI=0.48-0.98). The present study provides evidence that TATC and CAA insertion/deletion polymorphisms are associated with CSCC, indicating that genetic variation in RTN4 3'-UTR contributes to the susceptibility to CSCC.

Stereotactic body radiation therapy in spinal metastases.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-02-11,"Based on reports of safety and efficacy, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for treatment of malignant spinal tumors was initiated at our institution. We report prospective results of this population at Mayo Clinic. Between April 2008 and December 2010, 85 lesions in 66 patients were treated with SBRT for spinal metastases. Twenty-two lesions (25.8%) were treated for recurrence after prior radiotherapy (RT). The mean age of patients was 56.8 ± 13.4 years. Patients were treated to a median dose of 24 Gy (range, 10-40 Gy) in a median of three fractions (range, 1-5). Radiation was delivered with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and prescribed to cover 80% of the planning target volume (PTV) with organs at risk such as the spinal cord taking priority over PTV coverage. Tumor sites included 48, 22, 12, and 3 in the thoracic, lumbar, cervical, and sacral spine, respectively. The mean actuarial survival at 12 months was 52.2%. A total of 7 patients had both local and marginal failure, 1 patient experienced marginal but not local failure, and 1 patient had local failure only. Actuarial local control at 1 year was 83.3% and 91.2% in patients with and without prior RT. The median dose delivered to patients who experienced local/marginal failure was 24 Gy (range, 18-30 Gy) in a median of three fractions (range, 1-5). No cases of Grade 4 toxicity were reported. In 1 of 2 patients experiencing Grade 3 toxicity, SBRT was given after previous radiation. The results indicate SBRT to be an effective measure to achieve local control in spinal metastases. Toxicity of treatment was rare, including those previously irradiated. Our results appear comparable to previous reports analyzing spine SBRT.

A phase II study of bevacizumab in combination with definitive radiotherapy and cisplatin chemotherapy in untreated patients with locally advanced cervical carcinoma: preliminary results of RTOG 0417.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-02-16,"Concurrent cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is the standard treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer. RTOG 0417 was a Phase II study exploring the safety and efficacy of the addition of bevacizumab to standard CRT. Eligible patients with bulky tumors (Stage IB-IIIB) were treated with once-weekly cisplatin (40 mg/m(2)) chemotherapy and standard pelvic radiotherapy and brachytherapy. Bevacizumab was administered at 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks for three cycles. Treatment-related serious adverse event (SAE) and other adverse event (AE) rates within the first 90 days from treatment start were determined. Treatment-related SAEs were defined as any Grade ≥ 4 vaginal bleeding or thrombotic event or Grade ≥ 3 arterial event, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, or bowel/bladder perforation, or any Grade 5 treatment-related death. Treatment-related AEs included all SAEs and Grade 3 or 4 GI toxicity persisting for >2 weeks despite medical intervention, Grade 4 neutropenia or leukopenia persisting for >7 days, febrile neutropenia, Grade 3 or 4 other hematologic toxicity, and Grade 3 or 4 GI, renal, cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, or neurologic AEs. All AEs were scored using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE) v 3.0 (MedDRA version 6.0). A total of 60 patients from 28 institutions were enrolled between 2006 and 2009, and of these, 49 patients were evaluable. The median follow-up was 12.4 months (range, 4.6-31.4 months).The median age was 45 years (range, 22-80 years).

The importance of applying a sentinel lymph node mapping algorithm in endometrial cancer staging: beyond removal of blue nodes.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2012-02-22,"To determine the false-negative rate of a surgical sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping algorithm that incorporates more than just removing SLNs in detecting metastatic endometrial cancer. A prospective database of all patients who underwent lymphatic mapping for endometrial cancer was reviewed. Cervical injection of blue dye was used in all cases. The surgical algorithm is as follows: 1) peritoneal and serosal evaluation and washings; 2) retroperitoneal evaluation including excision of all mapped SLNs and suspicious nodes regardless of mapping; and 3) if there is no mapping on a hemi-pelvis, a side-specific pelvic, common iliac, and interiliac lymph node dissection (LND) is performed. Paraaortic LND is performed at the attendings' discretion. The algorithm was retrospectively applied. From 9/2005 to 4/2011, 498 patients received a blue dye cervical injection for SLN mapping. At least one LN was removed in 95% of cases (474/498); at least one SLN was identified in 81% (401/498). SLN correctly diagnosed 40/47 patients with nodal metastases who had at least one SLN mapped, resulting in a 15% false-negative rate. After applying the algorithm, the false-negative rate dropped to 2%. Only one patient, whose LN spread would not have been caught by the algorithm, had an isolated positive right paraaortic LN with a negative ipsilateral SLN and pelvic LND. Satisfactory SLN mapping in endometrial cancer requires adherence to a surgical SLN algorithm and goes beyond just the removal of blue SLNs. Removal of any suspicious node along with side-specific lymphadenectomy for failed mapping are an integral part of this algorithm. Further validation of the false-negative rate of this algorithm is necessary.",Journal Article,2890.0,181.0,To determine the false-negative rate of a surgical sentinel lymph node SLN mapping algorithm that incorporates more than just removing SLNs in detecting metastatic cancer A prospective database of all patients who underwent lymphatic mapping for cancer was reviewed injection of blue dye was used in all cases The surgical algorithm is as follows 1 peritoneal and serosal evaluation and washings 2 retroperitoneal evaluation including excision of all mapped SLNs and suspicious nodes regardless of mapping and 3 if there is no mapping on a hemi-pelvis a side-specific pelvic common iliac and interiliac lymph node dissection LND is performed Paraaortic LND is performed at the attendings discretion The algorithm was retrospectively applied From 9/2005 to 4/2011 498 patients received a blue dye injection for SLN mapping At least one LN was removed in 95 of cases 474/498 at least one SLN was identified in 81 401/498 SLN correctly diagnosed 40/47 patients with nodal metastases who had at least one SLN mapped resulting in a 15 false-negative rate After applying the algorithm the false-negative rate dropped to 2 Only one patient whose LN spread would not have been caught by the algorithm had an isolated positive right paraaortic LN with a negative ipsilateral SLN and pelvic LND Satisfactory SLN mapping in cancer requires adherence to a surgical SLN algorithm and goes beyond just the removal of blue SLNs Removal of any suspicious node along with side-specific lymphadenectomy for failed mapping are an integral part of this algorithm Further validation of the false-negative rate of this algorithm is necessary,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[6, 223, 3, 2133, 199, 116, 1, 8, 221, 1323, 263, 289, 1099, 2568, 2124, 17, 6175, 80, 76, 4673, 9026, 2642, 4, 2502, 113, 12, 8, 482, 609, 1, 62, 7, 54, 208, 2936, 2568, 9, 12, 10, 446, 1754, 1, 3352, 3796, 10, 95, 4, 62, 140, 3, 221, 2124, 16, 22, 2962, 14, 1639, 2, 17169, 451, 2, 11161, 18, 2591, 451, 141, 1366, 1, 62, 6224, 2642, 2, 3230, 502, 1583, 1, 2568, 2, 27, 492, 125, 16, 77, 2568, 23, 8, 16784, 3270, 8, 1152, 112, 1110, 186, 6692, 2, 61174, 263, 289, 1161, 3400, 16, 173, 7401, 3400, 16, 173, 28, 3, 35311, 7772, 3, 2124, 10, 894, 1498, 29, 83, 1242, 6, 39, 1132, 8928, 7, 103, 8, 3352, 3796, 1754, 9, 1099, 2568, 28, 506, 104, 1763, 10, 2264, 4, 48, 1, 140, 10282, 8928, 28, 506, 104, 1099, 10, 108, 4, 865, 7191, 8928, 1099, 4911, 265, 327, 662, 7, 5, 779, 196, 54, 42, 28, 506, 104, 1099, 6224, 1113, 4, 8, 167, 2133, 199, 116, 50, 4798, 3, 2124, 3, 2133, 199, 116, 8801, 6, 18, 158, 104, 69, 1310, 1763, 2579, 688, 44, 47, 85, 38005, 20, 3, 2124, 42, 35, 1355, 109, 1913, 7401, 1763, 5, 8, 199, 2880, 1099, 2, 1110, 3400, 7972, 1099, 2568, 4, 12, 1706, 2149, 6, 8, 221, 1099, 2124, 2, 23967, 1654, 4673, 3, 2829, 1, 3352, 2642, 2829, 1, 500, 3230, 289, 1510, 5, 1152, 112, 2048, 9, 1551, 2568, 32, 35, 4450, 760, 1, 26, 2124, 195, 929, 1, 3, 2133, 199, 116, 1, 26, 2124, 16, 1493]",1619.0,22366409,409

Biological predictors of cervical cancer response to radiation therapy.,Seminars in radiation oncology,Semin Radiat Oncol,2012-04-01,"The addition of cisplatin-based chemotherapy to standard radiation therapy reduces the risk of recurrence and disease-related death rates from locally advanced cervical cancers by as much as 50%. However, the absolute gains are relatively small for patients with early tumors, many of whom would have been cured with radiation alone, and recurrence rates are still high for patients who have very large or advanced-stage tumors. As a result, there is a pressing need for more accurate predictors of radiocurability. A variety of types of biomarkers have been shown to correlate with cervical cancer response to radiation therapy. These include traditional clinical and morphologic predictors, non-molecular biomarkers, including hypoxia and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) avidity, as well as molecular biomarkers, which include single-gene markers or array-based multigene predictors. Multi-gene predictors of response remain immature in cervical cancer, but studies thus far have paved the way for future studies to validate these findings.

In addition, new biomarkers will be of major value only if they add to the predictive value of traditional clinical and morphologic predictors.

mTOR as a molecular target in HPV-associated oral and cervical squamous carcinomas.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2012-03-12,"The incidence of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has increased over the past decades in the United States. We aimed at examining the global impact of HPV-associated HNSCC and whether the established key role of mTOR activation in HNSCC is also observed in HPV(+) HNSCC lesions, thereby providing novel treatment options for HPV-associated HNSCC patients. An international HNSCC tissue microarray (TMA) was used to analyze the expression of p16(INK4A), a surrogate for HPV infection, and Akt-mTOR pathway activation. Results were confirmed in a large collection of HPV(-) and HPV(+) HNSCC cases and in a cervical cancer (CCSCC) TMA. Observations were validated in HNSCC and CCSCC-derived cell lines, which were xenografted into immunodeficient mice for tumorigenesis assays. Approximately 20% of all HNSCC lesions could be classified as HPV(+), irrespective of their country of origin. mTOR pathway activation was observed in most HPV(+) HNSCC and CCSCC lesions and cell lines. The preclinical efficacy of mTOR inhibition by rapamycin and RAD001 was explored in HPV(+) HNSCC and CCSCC tumor xenografts. Both mTOR inhibitors effectively decreased mTOR activity in vivo and caused a remarkable decrease in tumor burden. These results emphasize the emerging global impact of HPV-related HNSCCs and indicate that the activation of the mTOR pathway is a widespread event in both HPV(-) and HPV-associated HNSCC and CCSCC lesions.

"Minireview: human ovarian cancer: biology, current management, and paths to personalizing therapy.",Endocrinology,Endocrinology,2012-03-13,"More than 90% of ovarian cancers have been thought to arise from epithelial cells that cover the ovarian surface or, more frequently, line subserosal cysts. Recent studies suggest that histologically similar cancers can arise from the fimbriae of Fallopian tubes and from deposits of endometriosis. Different histotypes are observed that resemble epithelial cells from the normal Fallopian tube (serous), endometrium (endometrioid), cervical glands (mucinous), and vaginal rests (clear cell) and that share expression of relevant HOX genes which drive normal gynecological differentiation. Two groups of epithelial ovarian cancers have been distinguished: type I low-grade cancers that present in early stage, grow slowly, and resist conventional chemotherapy but may respond to hormonal manipulation; and type II high-grade cancers that are generally diagnosed in advanced stage and grow aggressively but respond to chemotherapy. Type I cancers have wild-type p53 and BRCA1/2, but have frequent mutations of Ras and Raf as well as expression of IGFR and activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Virtually all type II cancers have mutations of p53, and almost half have mutation or dysfunction of BRCA1/2, but other mutations are rare, and oncogenesis appears to be driven by amplification of several growth-regulatory genes that activate the Ras/MAPK and PI3K pathways. Cytoreductive surgery and combination chemotherapy with platinum compounds and taxanes have improved 5-yr survival, but less than 40% of all stages can be cured. Novel therapies are being developed that target high-grade serous cancer cells with PI3Kness or BRCAness as well as the tumor vasculature.

Impact of heterogeneity-based dose calculation using a deterministic grid-based Boltzmann equation solver for intracavitary brachytherapy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-03-19,"To investigate the dosimetric impact of the heterogeneity dose calculation Acuros (Transpire Inc., Gig Harbor, WA), a grid-based Boltzmann equation solver (GBBS), for brachytherapy in a cohort of cervical cancer patients. The impact of heterogeneities was retrospectively assessed in treatment plans for 26 patients who had previously received (192)Ir intracavitary brachytherapy for cervical cancer with computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance-compatible tandems and unshielded colpostats. The GBBS models sources, patient boundaries, applicators, and tissue heterogeneities. Multiple GBBS calculations were performed with and without solid model applicator, with and without overriding the patient contour to 1 g/cm(3) muscle, and with and without overriding contrast materials to muscle or 2.25 g/cm(3) bone. Impact of source and boundary modeling, applicator, tissue heterogeneities, and sensitivity of CT-to-material mapping of contrast were derived from the multiple calculations. American Association of Physicists in Medicine Task Group 43 (TG-43) guidelines and the GBBS were compared for the following clinical dosimetric parameters: Manchester points A and B, International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) report 38 rectal and bladder points, three and nine o'clock, and (D2cm3) to the bladder, rectum, and sigmoid. Points A and B, D(2) cm(3) bladder, ICRU bladder, and three and nine o'clock were within 5% of TG-43 for all GBBS calculations. The source and boundary and applicator account for most of the differences between the GBBS and TG-43 guidelines. The D(2cm3) rectum (n = 3), D(2cm3) sigmoid (n = 1), and ICRU rectum (n = 6) had differences of >5% from TG-43 for the worst case incorrect mapping of contrast to bone. Clinical dosimetric parameters were within 5% of TG-43 when rectal and balloon contrast were mapped to bone and radiopaque packing was not overridden. The GBBS has minimal impact on clinical parameters for this cohort of patients with unshielded applicators. The incorrect mapping of rectal and balloon contrast does not have a significant impact on clinical parameters.

Normal tissue complication probability analysis of acute gastrointestinal toxicity in cervical cancer patients undergoing intensity modulated radiation therapy and concurrent cisplatin.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-05-01,"To test the hypothesis that increased bowel radiation dose is associated with acute gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity in cervical cancer patients undergoing concurrent chemotherapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), using a previously derived normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model. Fifty patients with Stage I-III cervical cancer undergoing IMRT and concurrent weekly cisplatin were analyzed. Acute GI toxicity was graded using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale, excluding upper GI events. A logistic model was used to test correlations between acute GI toxicity and bowel dosimetric parameters. The primary objective was to test the association between Grade ≥2 GI toxicity and the volume of bowel receiving ≥45 Gy (V(45)) using the logistic model. Twenty-three patients (46%) had Grade ≥2 GI toxicity. The mean (SD) V(45) was 143 mL (99). The mean V(45) values for patients with and without Grade ≥2 GI toxicity were 176 vs. 115 mL, respectively. Twenty patients (40%) had V(45) >150 mL. The proportion of patients with Grade ≥2 GI toxicity with and without V(45) >150 mL was 65% vs. 33% (p = 0.03). Logistic model parameter estimates V50 and γ were 161 mL (95% confidence interval [CI] 60-399) and 0.31 (95% CI 0.04-0.63), respectively. On multivariable logistic regression, increased V(45) was associated with an increased odds of Grade ≥2 GI toxicity (odds ratio 2.19 per 100 mL, 95% CI 1.04-4.63, p = 0.04). Our results support the hypothesis that increasing bowel V(45) is correlated with increased GI toxicity in cervical cancer patients undergoing IMRT and concurrent cisplatin. Reducing bowel V(45) could reduce the risk of Grade ≥2 GI toxicity by approximately 50% per 100 mL of bowel spared.",Journal Article,2821.0,29.0,To test the hypothesis that increased bowel radiation dose is associated with acute GI toxicity in cancer patients undergoing concurrent chemotherapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy IMRT using a previously derived normal tissue complication probability NTCP model Fifty patients with Stage I-III cancer undergoing IMRT and concurrent weekly cisplatin were analyzed Acute GI toxicity was graded using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale excluding upper GI events A logistic model was used to test correlations between acute GI toxicity and bowel dosimetric parameters The primary objective was to test the association between Grade ≥2 GI toxicity and the volume of bowel receiving ≥45 Gy V 45 using the logistic model Twenty-three patients 46 had Grade ≥2 GI toxicity The mean SD V 45 was 143 mL 99 The mean V 45 values for patients with and without Grade ≥2 GI toxicity were 176 vs. 115 mL respectively Twenty patients 40 had V 45 150 mL The proportion of patients with Grade ≥2 GI toxicity with and without V 45 150 mL was 65 vs. 33 p 0.03 Logistic model parameter estimates V50 and γ were 161 mL 95 confidence interval CI 60-399 and 0.31 95 CI 0.04-0.63 respectively On multivariable logistic regression increased V 45 was associated with an increased odds of Grade ≥2 GI toxicity odds ratio 2.19 per 100 mL 95 CI 1.04-4.63 p 0.04 Our results support the hypothesis that increasing bowel V 45 is correlated with increased GI toxicity in cancer patients undergoing IMRT and concurrent cisplatin Reducing bowel V 45 could reduce the risk of Grade ≥2 GI toxicity by approximately 50 per 100 mL of bowel spared,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[6, 412, 3, 1492, 17, 101, 1659, 121, 61, 16, 41, 5, 286, 2104, 155, 4, 12, 7, 479, 750, 56, 2, 837, 1757, 121, 36, 964, 75, 8, 373, 526, 295, 246, 1447, 1320, 13479, 202, 1461, 7, 5, 82, 70, 316, 12, 479, 964, 2, 750, 709, 540, 11, 311, 286, 2104, 155, 10, 3468, 75, 3, 121, 36, 413, 87, 1124, 3207, 1726, 2104, 281, 8, 812, 202, 10, 95, 6, 412, 2553, 59, 286, 2104, 155, 2, 1659, 3187, 1038, 3, 86, 461, 10, 6, 412, 3, 248, 59, 88, 3107, 2104, 155, 2, 3, 433, 1, 1659, 357, 19939, 381, 603, 512, 75, 3, 812, 202, 737, 169, 7, 641, 42, 88, 3107, 2104, 155, 3, 313, 1270, 603, 512, 10, 4400, 542, 1058, 3, 313, 603, 512, 1030, 9, 7, 5, 2, 187, 88, 3107, 2104, 155, 11, 5800, 105, 3670, 542, 106, 737, 7, 327, 42, 603, 512, 1577, 542, 3, 920, 1, 7, 5, 88, 3107, 2104, 155, 5, 2, 187, 603, 512, 1577, 542, 10, 556, 105, 466, 19, 13, 680, 812, 202, 4219, 1423, 23541, 2, 2655, 11, 5377, 542, 48, 307, 268, 58, 335, 9623, 2, 13, 456, 48, 58, 13, 755, 13, 676, 106, 23, 658, 812, 320, 101, 603, 512, 10, 41, 5, 35, 101, 610, 1, 88, 3107, 2104, 155, 610, 197, 18, 326, 379, 394, 542, 48, 58, 14, 755, 39, 676, 19, 13, 755, 114, 99, 538, 3, 1492, 17, 602, 1659, 603, 512, 16, 438, 5, 101, 2104, 155, 4, 12, 7, 479, 964, 2, 750, 540, 1818, 1659, 603, 512, 359, 969, 3, 43, 1, 88, 3107, 2104, 155, 20, 705, 212, 379, 394, 542, 1, 1659, 6830]",1625.0,22516388,680
Selective neck dissection in node-positive squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.,Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,2012-04-18,"The optimal type of neck dissection in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with clinical cervical metastases has not been determined. The following study was performed to determine the rate of regional control with selective neck dissection (SND) in these patients. Case series with planned data collection. Single institution, cancer center. Patients with cervical lymph node metastases from mucosal cancers of the head and neck who were treated with SND from 2000 to 2010 were selected. Demographics, tumor characteristics, extent of neck dissection, adjuvant treatments, locoregional control, and survival were recorded. Recurrence in the neck and disease-specific survival (DSS) were primary and secondary end points. One hundred eight patients underwent SND. Sixty-nine (64%) were male. Median age was 62 (20-89) years. The most common primary site was the oral cavity (71.3%). Ninety-five (88%) received adjuvant treatment. Median follow-up was 21 months. Six patients (5.5%) had isolated recurrence in the dissected neck. Patients with N2C disease had poorer neck recurrence-free survival.

Reoperative lymph node dissection for recurrent papillary thyroid cancer and effect on serum thyroglobulin.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2012-04-24,"Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) has an excellent prognosis with current treatment methods. However, the rates of locoregional recurrence after initial surgical management remain significant. This study evaluates the effect of reoperative neck dissection for locoregional recurrence of PTC after initial total thyroidectomy and radioiodine therapy on the incidence of cervical recurrence and postoperative serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels. This is a retrospective cohort study conducted in a single academic medical center of patients with recurrent or persistent PTC isolated to the neck after previous total thyroidectomy with or without lymph node dissection and adjuvant I(131) therapy who were treated with reoperative lymph node dissection. Outcomes including operative complications, pathologic findings, and effect of surgery on Tg levels and rates of recurrent disease were analyzed. From 2001 to 2010, a total of 61 patients had reoperative neck dissections for recurrent cervical PTC with a complication rate of 5 %. Seventy-two percent of patients were clinically free of detectable disease, and 28 % of patients had recurrent, persistent, or newly metastatic disease detected during the follow-up period. All patients had significant decreases in Tg levels, with a median 98 % reduction in preoperative levels. However, only 21 % of patients had an undetectable stimulated Tg (<0.5 ng/mL) during the follow-up period of 15.5 months.

The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical and pathologic features of cervical rhabdomyosarcoma. We retrospectively reviewed all patients with cervical rhabdomyosarcoma who presented to our institution from 1980 to 2010. We reviewed pathologic, demographic, and clinical information. During the study period, 11 females presented with cervical rhabdomyosarcoma. The median age at presentation was 18.4 years, and 6 patients were <19 years old at diagnosis. Vaginal bleeding was the most common presenting symptom, and a vaginal mass was often a co-presenting symptom. Eight patients (73%) presented with stage IB disease, and 8 (73%) presented with the embryonal (botryoid) histologic subtype. Nine patients (82%) received multimodal therapy consisting of surgery with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or both. All patients were without evidence of disease after completion of primary therapy, but 3 patients experienced local recurrence. At a median follow-up of 23 months, 6 patients (55%) were without evidence of disease, 1 (9%) was alive with disease, 1 (9%) had died of disease, and 3 (27%) had died of other causes. Three patients (27%) had other primary malignancies in addition to rhabdomyosarcoma-1 had a Sertoli-Leydig tumor, 1 had a Sertoli-Leydig tumor and a pinealoblastoma, and 1 had thyroid cancer and a parotid adenocarcinoma.

Prognostic value of lymph node ratio and clinicopathologic parameters in patients diagnosed with stage IIIC endometrial cancer.,Obstetrics and gynecology,Obstet Gynecol,2012-06-01,"To estimate the prognostic significance of lymph node ratio with respect to clinicopathologic characteristics in stage IIIC endometrial cancer patients. Using data from medical records and surgery notes, we identified all consecutive patients with stage IIIC endometrial cancer who received primary surgical treatment between 1993 and 2008. Lymph node ratio is the number of metastatic lymph nodes to the total number of removed lymph nodes. Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard methods. Two hundred sixteen patients with stage IIIC endometrial cancer were included in this multicenter study. Age, number of metastatic lymph nodes, lymph node ratio, grossly suspicious lymph nodes, histologic subtype, and cervical metastasis were associated with progression-free survival and overall survival, respectively. Patients with lymph node ratios 10% or less, more than 10-50%, and more than 50% had 5-year overall survival rates of 79.0%, 60.6%, and 35.8%, respectively (P<.001). In multivariable analysis, only lymph node ratio was associated with both progression-free survival and overall survival, respectively. Total number of removed lymph nodes and number of metastatic lymph nodes did not correlate with overall survival in the group with grossly suspicious lymph nodes, whereas lymph node ratio did. In the subgroup of 123 (56.9%) patients who had pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomies with a minimum of 10 lymph nodes removed, age and lymph node ratio were still associated with progression-free survival and overall survival, whereas total lymph nodes removed was not. Stratification based on lymph node ratio is useful when comprehensive lymphadenectomy is routinely performed and likely reflects metastatic nodal tumor burden. These data provide another prognostic variable in the heterogenic group of women with stage IIIC endometrial cancer.

J. Gynecol. Cancer,2012-06-01,"Gemcitabine is active in several gynecologic malignancies including ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, and uterine leiomyosarcoma. It has been used in an off-label setting for the treatment of advanced endometrial cancer, despite lack of published data showing efficacy. We performed a retrospective study to determine the progression-free survival and response rate of endometrial cancer patients treated with gemcitabine at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Eligible patients had histologically confirmed advanced (stage IV or recurrent) endometrial cancer that was treated with single-agent gemcitabine at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between 1999 and 2009. Response to therapy was determined by review of computed tomography imaging by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 criteria. Forty-six patients were included in the analysis. Median age was 66 years (range, 52-87 years). All patients were previously treated with chemotherapy. The median number of prior lines of chemotherapy was 2 (range, 1-8). Median dose of gemcitabine administered was 800 mg/m infused on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. Predominant histology was endometrioid (48%, n = 22) followed by serous (35%, n = 16), clear cell (15%, n = 7), and undifferentiated (2%, n = 1). Overall response rate was 10.9% (95% confidence interval, 1.9%-19.9%); 5 patients (11%) achieved a partial response. Thirteen patients (28%) displayed stable disease lasting at least 3 months. Of note, 5 (71%) of the 7 patients with clear cell histology displayed stable disease or partial response (n = 5). The median progression-free survival was 3.0 months (95% confidence interval, 2.1-3.3 months). Nonhematologic grades 3 and 4 toxicities were rare. Ten patients (22%) were treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor during treatment. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia was seen in 4 patients (9%). There were no cases of grade 4 thrombocytopenia.

Human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA testing is highly sensitive and provides a high, long-term reassurance of low risk of cervical cancer. However, the specificity of HPV DNA testing is limited, requiring additional, more disease-specific markers for efficient screening approaches. Liquid-based cytology samples were collected from 625 women referred to colposcopy. A slide was stained using the CINtec plus cytology assay. Pap cytology and HPV genotyping were conducted from the same vial. Clinical performance characteristics were calculated for all women, stratified by age, and for women referred with a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) Pap. p16/Ki-67 positivity increased with histologic severity, from 26.8% in normal histology, 46.5% in CIN1, 82.8% in CIN2 to 92.8% in CIN3. Among women with CIN3, p16/Ki-67 positivity increased from 77.8% for women younger than 30 years without HPV16 to 100% for women 30 years and older with HPV16. The sensitivity and specificity to detect CIN3+ were 93.2% and 46.1%, respectively, and increased to 97.2% and 60.0% among women 30 years and older. In women with high-risk (HR)-HPV-positive atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and LSIL, sensitivity and specificity for detection of CIN3 were 90.6% and 48.6%, respectively. p16/Ki-67 testing could reduce referral to colposcopy by almost half while detecting the most severe cases of CIN3. The high sensitivity of p16/Ki-67 with significantly improved specificity compared with HPV testing makes p16/Ki-67 a viable option for LSIL triage. Further studies are required to evaluate p16/Ki-67 as triage marker in HPV-based screening strategies.",Journal Article,2785.0,127.0,Cytology-based screening has limited sensitivity to detect prevalent precancers Human papilloma virus HPV DNA testing is highly sensitive and provides a high long-term reassurance of low risk of cancer However the specificity of HPV DNA testing is limited requiring additional more disease-specific markers for efficient screening approaches Liquid-based cytology samples were collected from 625 women referred to colposcopy A slide was stained using the CINtec plus cytology assay Pap cytology and HPV genotyping were conducted from the same vial Clinical performance characteristics were calculated for all women stratified by age and for women referred with a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion LSIL Pap p16/Ki-67 positivity increased with histologic severity from 26.8 in normal histology 46.5 in CIN1 82.8 in CIN2 to 92.8 in CIN3 Among women with CIN3 p16/Ki-67 positivity increased from 77.8 for women younger than 30 years without HPV16 to 100 for women 30 years and older with HPV16 The sensitivity and specificity to detect CIN3+ were 93.2 and 46.1 respectively and increased to 97.2 and 60.0 among women 30 years and older In women with high-risk HR -HPV-positive atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance ASC-US and LSIL sensitivity and specificity for detection of CIN3 were 90.6 and 48.6 respectively p16/Ki-67 testing could reduce referral to colposcopy by almost half while detecting the most severe cases of CIN3 The high sensitivity of p16/Ki-67 with significantly improved specificity compared with HPV testing makes p16/Ki-67 a viable option for LSIL triage Further studies are required to evaluate p16/Ki-67 as triage marker in HPV-based screening strategies,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[2045, 90, 453, 71, 383, 485, 6, 1426, 2485, 18753, 171, 7017, 1450, 933, 261, 471, 16, 561, 745, 2, 777, 8, 64, 319, 337, 14491, 1, 154, 43, 1, 12, 137, 3, 1121, 1, 933, 261, 471, 16, 383, 1888, 402, 80, 34, 112, 525, 9, 2547, 453, 611, 3165, 90, 2045, 347, 11, 786, 29, 9629, 117, 1995, 6, 9946, 8, 7911, 10, 3386, 75, 3, 47229, 349, 2045, 719, 4290, 2045, 2, 933, 2686, 11, 426, 29, 3, 827, 29225, 38, 528, 374, 11, 981, 9, 62, 117, 1173, 20, 89, 2, 9, 117, 1995, 5, 8, 154, 88, 691, 4153, 1180, 17849, 4290, 1932, 2311, 598, 1887, 101, 5, 884, 1702, 29, 432, 66, 4, 295, 784, 641, 33, 4, 23728, 878, 66, 4, 12870, 6, 937, 66, 4, 10346, 107, 117, 5, 10346, 1932, 2311, 598, 1887, 101, 29, 849, 66, 9, 117, 773, 76, 201, 60, 187, 4048, 6, 394, 9, 117, 201, 60, 2, 434, 5, 4048, 3, 485, 2, 1121, 6, 1426, 10346, 11, 966, 18, 2, 641, 14, 106, 2, 101, 6, 1015, 18, 2, 335, 13, 107, 117, 201, 60, 2, 434, 4, 117, 5, 64, 43, 168, 933, 109, 1973, 691, 37, 1, 5206, 724, 5203, 843, 2, 17849, 485, 2, 1121, 9, 638, 1, 10346, 11, 424, 49, 2, 576, 49, 106, 1932, 2311, 598, 471, 359, 969, 2096, 6, 9946, 20, 2214, 1303, 369, 2502, 3, 96, 905, 140, 1, 10346, 3, 64, 485, 1, 1932, 2311, 598, 5, 97, 231, 1121, 72, 5, 933, 471, 4677, 1932, 2311, 598, 8, 2663, 1501, 9, 17849, 9059, 195, 94, 32, 616, 6, 376, 1932, 2311, 598, 22, 9059, 952, 4, 933, 90, 453, 422]",1696.0,22675168,723
Cervical cancers require the continuous expression of the human papillomavirus type 16 E7 oncoprotein even in the presence of the viral E6 oncoprotein.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2012-06-13,"High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV), such as HPV-16, are etiologic agents of a variety of anogenital and oral malignancies, including nearly all cases of cervical cancer. Cervical cancers arising in transgenic mice that express HPV-16 E7 in an inducible manner require the continuous expression of E7 for their maintenance. However, in HPV-associated cancers in vivo, E6 and E7 invariably are coexpressed. In this study, we investigated whether cervical cancers rely on the continuous expression of E7 in the context of constitutively expressed E6. We placed the inducible HPV-16 E7 transgene onto a background in which HPV-16 E6 was constitutively expressed. In transgenic mice with high-grade cervical dysplastic lesions and cervical cancer, repressing the expression of E7 led to the regression of all cancers and the vast majority of high-grade dysplastic lesions. In addition, cervical cancers were occasionally observed in transgenic mice in which E7 was repressed and then reexpressed. Our findings indicate that even in the presence of constitutively expressed E6, the continuous expression of E7 is required for the maintenance of cervical cancers and most precancerous lesions. These data have important implications for the potential clinical use of drugs designed to inhibit the expression and/or function of E7 to treat HPV-associated cancers.",Journal Article,2778.0,32.0,High-risk human papillomaviruses HPV such as HPV-16 are etiologic agents of a variety of anogenital and oral malignancies including nearly all cases of cancer cancers arising in transgenic mice that express HPV-16 E7 in an inducible manner require the continuous expression of E7 for their maintenance However in HPV-associated cancers in vivo E6 and E7 invariably are coexpressed In this study we investigated whether cancers rely on the continuous expression of E7 in the context of constitutively expressed E6 We placed the inducible HPV-16 E7 transgene onto a background in which HPV-16 E6 was constitutively expressed In transgenic mice with high-grade dysplastic lesions and cancer repressing the expression of E7 led to the regression of all cancers and the vast majority of high-grade dysplastic lesions In addition cancers were occasionally observed in transgenic mice in which E7 was repressed and then reexpressed Our findings indicate that even in the presence of constitutively expressed E6 the continuous expression of E7 is required for the maintenance of cancers and most precancerous lesions These data have important implications for the potential clinical use of drugs designed to inhibit the expression and/or function of E7 to treat HPV-associated cancers,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[64, 43, 171, 14731, 933, 225, 22, 933, 245, 32, 6604, 183, 1, 8, 1362, 1, 13836, 2, 518, 441, 141, 1857, 62, 140, 1, 12, 163, 2635, 4, 2862, 399, 17, 1669, 933, 245, 4540, 4, 35, 2877, 1708, 1353, 3, 1314, 55, 1, 4540, 9, 136, 1146, 137, 4, 933, 41, 163, 4, 386, 4837, 2, 4540, 6912, 32, 10185, 4, 26, 45, 21, 565, 317, 163, 5533, 23, 3, 1314, 55, 1, 4540, 4, 3, 1533, 1, 2818, 570, 4837, 21, 3295, 3, 2877, 933, 245, 4540, 6632, 3301, 8, 2426, 4, 92, 933, 245, 4837, 10, 2818, 570, 4, 2862, 399, 5, 64, 88, 6461, 406, 2, 12, 13803, 3, 55, 1, 4540, 836, 6, 3, 320, 1, 62, 163, 2, 3, 4337, 686, 1, 64, 88, 6461, 406, 4, 352, 163, 11, 6319, 164, 4, 2862, 399, 4, 92, 4540, 10, 6654, 2, 818, 43127, 114, 272, 1008, 17, 871, 4, 3, 463, 1, 2818, 570, 4837, 3, 1314, 55, 1, 4540, 16, 616, 9, 3, 1146, 1, 163, 2, 96, 6605, 406, 46, 74, 47, 305, 1268, 9, 3, 174, 38, 119, 1, 600, 1114, 6, 1433, 3, 55, 2, 15, 343, 1, 4540, 6, 943, 933, 41, 163]",1276.0,22700879,50
A microRNA expression signature for the prognosis of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2012-06-26,"Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) rates have been increasing significantly in recent years, despite a decreasing incidence of head and neck cancer in general. Oropharyngeal SCC has many characteristics that are distinct from other head and neck cancers, and thus it is important to focus specifically on cancers arising in this region, with the goal of improving patient outcomes. One important goal is to identify those patients who are likely to fail standard therapy and who could potentially benefit from alternative or targeted treatments. In the current study, the prognostic value of microRNAs (miRNAs) was evaluated in patients with oropharyngeal SCC. miRNAs are small, noncoding RNAs that are master regulators of many important biological processes. In total, 150 oropharyngeal tumors were analyzed using the recently developed quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based method for miRNA expression profiling. In addition, the expression of miRNAs was also compared with human papillomavirus (HPV) transcriptional activities. The current study identified 6 miRNAs that were found to be significantly associated with cancer survival. A combined expression signature of these miRNAs was prognostic of oropharyngeal SCC, independent of common clinical features or HPV status. This new miRNA signature was experimentally validated in an independent oropharyngeal SCC cohort. Furthermore, 5 HPV-related miRNAs were identified, which may help to characterize HPV-induced cancers including both oropharyngeal and cervical SCC.",Journal Article,2765.0,48.0,squamous cell carcinoma SCC rates have been increasing significantly in recent years despite a decreasing incidence of head and cancer in general SCC has many characteristics that are distinct from other head and cancers and thus it is important to focus specifically on cancers arising in this region with the goal of improving patient outcomes One important goal is to identify those patients who are likely to fail standard therapy and who could potentially benefit from alternative or targeted treatments In the current study the prognostic value of microRNAs miRNAs was evaluated in patients with SCC miRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that are master regulators of many important biological processes In total 150 tumors were analyzed using the recently developed quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based method for miRNA expression profiling In addition the expression of miRNAs was also compared with human papillomavirus HPV transcriptional activities The current study identified 6 miRNAs that were found to be significantly associated with cancer survival A combined expression signature of these miRNAs was prognostic of SCC independent of common clinical features or HPV status This new miRNA signature was experimentally validated in an independent SCC cohort Furthermore 5 HPV-related miRNAs were identified which may help to characterize HPV-induced cancers including both and SCC,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[691, 31, 134, 1791, 151, 47, 85, 602, 97, 4, 435, 60, 550, 8, 2777, 287, 1, 718, 2, 12, 4, 1083, 1791, 71, 445, 374, 17, 32, 834, 29, 127, 718, 2, 163, 2, 631, 192, 16, 305, 6, 1222, 1225, 23, 163, 2635, 4, 26, 1053, 5, 3, 1326, 1, 1673, 69, 123, 104, 305, 1326, 16, 6, 255, 135, 7, 54, 32, 322, 6, 4373, 260, 36, 2, 54, 359, 751, 247, 29, 1091, 15, 238, 640, 4, 3, 291, 45, 3, 177, 549, 1, 3515, 2028, 10, 194, 4, 7, 5, 1791, 2028, 32, 302, 6420, 4550, 17, 32, 7561, 3196, 1, 445, 305, 1037, 1849, 4, 181, 1577, 57, 11, 311, 75, 3, 761, 276, 1156, 1451, 1260, 1329, 90, 596, 9, 2053, 55, 1080, 4, 352, 3, 55, 1, 2028, 10, 120, 72, 5, 171, 3242, 933, 1431, 2042, 3, 291, 45, 108, 49, 2028, 17, 11, 204, 6, 40, 97, 41, 5, 12, 25, 8, 397, 55, 1651, 1, 46, 2028, 10, 177, 1, 1791, 306, 1, 186, 38, 404, 15, 933, 156, 26, 217, 2053, 1651, 10, 8593, 938, 4, 35, 306, 1791, 180, 798, 33, 933, 139, 2028, 11, 108, 92, 68, 987, 6, 1507, 933, 277, 163, 141, 110, 2, 1791]",1397.0,22736309,224
The effect of treatment time in locally advanced cervical cancer in the era of concurrent chemoradiotherapy.,Cancer,Cancer,2012-07-17,"This study sought to determine if treatment time impacts pelvic failure (PF), distant failure (DF), or disease-specific mortality (DSM) in patients undergoing concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). A retrospective review was performed of 113 consecutive eligible patients with stage IB2 to IIIB cervical cancer. All patients received whole-pelvis radiation with concurrent chemotherapy and consolidative intracavitary brachytherapy (BT) to the cervix, followed by an external beam parametrial boost when appropriate. The effect of treatment time on PF, DF, and DSM was examined with univariate and multivariate analyses. Characteristics of patients with and without treatment prolongation were compared to explore reasons for treatment prolongation. The median time to completion of BT was 60 days, and the median time to complete all RT was 68 days. The 3-year cumulative incidence of PF, DF, and DSM were 18%, 23%, and 26%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, time to completion of BT >56 days was associated with increased PF (hazard ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-16; P = .02). The 3-year PF for >56 days versus ≤56 days was 26% versus 9% (P = .04). Treatment time was not associated with DF or DSM. Treatment prolongation was found to be associated with delay in starting BT and higher incidence of acute grade 3/4 toxicities. In the setting of CCRT, treatment time >56 days is detrimental to pelvic control but is not associated with an increase in DF or DSM.

Anatomic location of PET-positive aortocaval nodes in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer: implications for surgical staging.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2012-09-01,"Pathologic evaluation of aortocaval nodes in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer in an effort to better tailor radiotherapy has gained popularity. We sought to determine which aortocaval nodes should be sampled during surgical staging procedures. From 2004 to 2011, 246 patients with locally advanced cervical cancer underwent positron emission tomography (PET) before definitive chemoradiation. We reviewed the imaging studies to determine the location of PET-positive aortocaval nodes in relationship to the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). Forty-two patients (17%) had PET images suggesting aortocaval metastasis. Ten patients had stage IB, 1 had stage IIA, 13 had stage IIB, 13 had stage IIIB, and 5 had stage IV disease. Of these 42 patients, 39 (93%) had FDG-avid pelvic nodes, 1 (2%) had PET-negative pelvic nodes but FDG-avid common iliac nodes, and 2 (5%) had direct spread to the aortocaval nodes. Three patients (7%) had FDG-avid aortocaval nodes above the IMA without FDG-avid nodes between the aortic bifurcation and IMA. All 3 of these patients also had FDG-avid nodes in the pelvis. Nineteen patients (45%) had FDG-avid nodes above and below the IMA, and 20 (48%) had FDG-avid nodes below the IMA only.

A novel RT-PCR method for quantification of human papillomavirus transcripts in archived tissues and its application in oropharyngeal cancer prognosis.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2012-09-07,"Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is strongly associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, which is distinctively different from most other head and neck cancers. However, a robust quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) method for comprehensive expression profiling of HPV genes in routinely fixed tissues has not been reported. To address this issue, we have established a new real-time RT-PCR method for the expression profiling of the E6 and E7 oncogenes from 13 high-risk HPV types. This method was validated in cervical cancer and by comparison with another HPV RNA detection method (in situ hybridization) in oropharyngeal tumors. In addition, the expression profiles of selected HPV-related human genes were also analyzed. HPV E6 and E7 expression profiles were then analyzed in 150 archived oropharyngeal SCC samples and compared with other variables and with patient outcomes. Our study showed that RT-qPCR and RNA in situ hybridization were 100% concordant in determining HPV status. HPV transcriptional activity was found in most oropharyngeal SCC (81.3%), a prevalence that is higher than in previous studies. Besides HPV16, three other HPV types were also detected, including 33, 35 and 18. Furthermore, HPV and p16 had essentially identical expression signatures, and both HPV and p16 were prognostic biomarkers for the prediction of disease outcome. Thus, p16 mRNA or protein expression signature is a sensitive and specific surrogate marker for HPV transcriptional activity (all genotypes combined).",Journal Article,2692.0,56.0,squamous cell carcinoma SCC is strongly associated with human papillomavirus HPV infection which is distinctively different from most other head and cancers However a robust quantitative reverse transcription PCR RT-qPCR method for comprehensive expression profiling of HPV genes in routinely fixed tissues has not been reported To address this issue we have established a new real-time RT-PCR method for the expression profiling of the E6 and E7 oncogenes from 13 high-risk HPV types This method was validated in cancer and by comparison with another HPV RNA detection method in situ hybridization in tumors In addition the expression profiles of selected HPV-related human genes were also analyzed HPV E6 and E7 expression profiles were then analyzed in 150 archived SCC samples and compared with other variables and with patient outcomes Our study showed that RT-qPCR and RNA in situ hybridization were 100 concordant in determining HPV status HPV transcriptional activity was found in most SCC 81.3 a prevalence that is higher than in previous studies Besides HPV16 three other HPV types were also detected including 33 35 and 18 Furthermore HPV and p16 had essentially identical expression signatures and both HPV and p16 were prognostic biomarkers for the prediction of disease outcome Thus p16 mRNA or protein expression signature is a sensitive and specific surrogate marker for HPV transcriptional activity all genotypes combined,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[691, 31, 134, 1791, 16, 1327, 41, 5, 171, 3242, 933, 930, 92, 16, 26680, 338, 29, 96, 127, 718, 2, 163, 137, 8, 1922, 1156, 1772, 866, 604, 240, 6162, 596, 9, 949, 55, 1080, 1, 933, 214, 4, 3066, 1959, 742, 71, 44, 85, 210, 6, 1539, 26, 2537, 21, 47, 635, 8, 217, 1589, 98, 240, 604, 596, 9, 3, 55, 1080, 1, 3, 4837, 2, 4540, 3326, 29, 233, 64, 43, 933, 630, 26, 596, 10, 938, 4, 12, 2, 20, 1155, 5, 1809, 933, 893, 638, 596, 4, 957, 1554, 4, 57, 4, 352, 3, 55, 1241, 1, 715, 933, 139, 171, 214, 11, 120, 311, 933, 4837, 2, 4540, 55, 1241, 11, 818, 311, 4, 1577, 6282, 1791, 347, 2, 72, 5, 127, 682, 2, 5, 69, 123, 114, 45, 224, 17, 240, 6162, 2, 893, 4, 957, 1554, 11, 394, 3610, 4, 2196, 933, 156, 933, 1431, 128, 10, 204, 4, 96, 1791, 865, 27, 8, 1078, 17, 16, 142, 76, 4, 698, 94, 7301, 4048, 169, 127, 933, 630, 11, 120, 530, 141, 466, 465, 2, 203, 798, 933, 2, 1932, 42, 7257, 3038, 55, 2210, 2, 110, 933, 2, 1932, 11, 177, 582, 9, 3, 1590, 1, 34, 228, 631, 1932, 956, 15, 178, 55, 1651, 16, 8, 745, 2, 112, 2592, 952, 9, 933, 1431, 128, 62, 2071, 397]",1438.0,22821242,49

Tubal ligation frequency in Oklahoma women with cervical cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2012-07-31,"Infrequent Pap screening is an important risk factor for cervical cancer. We studied the association between contraceptive methods, screening frequency, and cancer. Women (n=2004) enrolled in the cross-sectional Study to Understand Cervical Cancer Endpoints and Determinants (SUCCEED) underwent colposcopy to evaluate an abnormal Pap test. Questionnaire data were compared between those with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3/adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and those with invasive cancer to identify factors associated with cancer. Logistic regression was used to calculate age-stratified measures of association between contraceptive method and Pap frequency as well as tubal ligation (TL) and cancer risk. In all age groups, women with TL were more likely to have had no Pap screening in the previous 5 years compared to women using other contraception: 26-35 years (OR 4.6, 95% CI 2.4-8.6; p<0.001), 36-45 years (OR 3.8, 95% CI 2.1-7.0; p<0.001), and 46-55 years (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0-4.9; p=0.050). Subjects with cancer (n=163) were more likely to have had a TL (41% vs. 21%, p<0.001) than those with CIN 3/AIS (n=370).

Treatment of metastatic cervical cancer: future directions involving targeted agents.,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol.,2012-08-09,"Cervical cancer is the third most common cause of female cancer mortality, and it remains a major health problem in populations with limited economic resources. Metastatic disease or recurrent lesions not amenable to radical local excision or regional radiation have a poor prognosis, and are treated with palliative platinum-based chemotherapy. There are few effective therapeutic options for patients who progressed after first-line chemotherapy. Future advances in the treatment of metastatic or recurrent disease may rely on more effective and better-tolerated therapies, and molecularly driven targeted agents could represent an attractive option.

Severe late toxicities following concomitant chemoradiotherapy compared to radiotherapy alone in cervical cancer: an inter-era analysis.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-08-14,"To compare rates of severe late toxicities following concomitant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy alone for cervical cancer. Patients with cervical cancer were treated at a single institution with radiotherapy alone or concomitant chemoradiotherapy for curative intent. Severe late toxicity was defined as grade≥3 vaginal, urologic, or gastrointestinal toxicity or any pelvic fracture, using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE), occurring ≥6 months from treatment completion and predating any salvage therapy. Severe late toxicity rates were compared after adjusting for pertinent covariates. At 3 years, probability of vaginal severe late toxicity was 20.2% for radiotherapy alone and 35.1% for concomitant chemoradiotherapy (P=.026). At 3 years, probability of skeletal severe late toxicity was 1.6% for radiotherapy alone and 7.5% for concomitant chemoradiotherapy (P=.010). After adjustment for case mix, concomitant chemoradiotherapy was associated with higher vaginal (hazard ratio [HR] 3.0, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-5.2, P<.001), and skeletal (HR 7.0, 95% CI 1.4-34.1, P=.016) severe late toxicity. Compared to high dilator compliance, moderate (HR 3.6, 95% CI 2.0-6.5, P<.001) and poor (HR 8.5, 95% CI 4.3-16.9, P<.001) dilator compliance was associated with higher vaginal severe late toxicity. Age>50 was associated with higher vaginal (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0, P=.013) and skeletal (HR 5.7, 95% CI 1.2-27.0, P=.028) severe late toxicity. Concomitant chemoradiotherapy was not associated with higher gastrointestinal (P=.886) or urologic (unadjusted, P=.053; adjusted, P=.063) severe late toxicity.

We added India ink as a mapping agent to determine whether this would allow us to pathologically identify sentinel parametrial nodes and to test our hypothesis that the parametrial nodes are the true SLNs in women with cervical cancer. We performed lymphatic mapping and SLN biopsy in 20 women with early-stage cervical cancer undergoing radical hysterectomy or trachelectomy using a ""triple injection"" technique with blue dye, radiocolloid, and India ink. Pathologic processing of parametrium and nodal tissue was then performed to identify India ink in specimens. On pathology review, 15 (75%) patients had a parametrial node identified, and 9 patients (45%) had bilateral parametrial nodes identified; the median number of parametrial nodes identified was 2 (range, 0-7). India ink was seen in at least 1 parametrial node in 13 (87%) of the 15 patients with a parametrial node identified pathologically. Of the 9 patients with bilateral parametrial nodes identified pathologically, only 5 (54%) had bilateral parametrial nodes containing India ink.

Parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma: outcomes and opportunities.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-09-25,"To examine patterns of failure in patients with parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma (PM-RMS) treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Forty-seven patients with PM-RMS received chemotherapy and IMRT for definitive treatment. The median age was 9 years (range, 0.5-35 years). The high-risk features were as follows: 40% alveolar histology, 72% group III and 26% group IV disease, 57% either intracranial extension (ICE) (n=25) or cranial neuropathy (n=21). The median time to RT from the start of chemotherapy was 15 weeks (range, 2-54 weeks). Patients received 50.4 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions to the primary tumor by use of IMRT. Thirteen patients aged≥14 years with alveolar histology received 36 Gy prophylactic nodal irradiation (PNI) to bilateral cervical nodes. Events were defined as local, regional (nodal), central nervous system (CNS), or distant failures. With a median follow-up time of 3.3 years (range, 0.5-12.8 years), 18 patients experienced failure: 5 local, 2 regional, 6 distant, and 7 CNS. The 5-year local failure-free survival was 86%. Age, histology, and time to RT did not influence the risk of local failure. The 5-year regional failure-free survival was 92%: 100% for embryonal and 74% for alveolar (P=.03). However, there were no lymph node failures in patients with alveolar histology who were given PNI. The 5-year CNS failure-free survival was 83%: 100% without and 70% with ICE (P=.01); 95% without and 69% with cranial neuropathy (P=.02). The estimated 5-year event-free survival and overall survival were 61% for group III and 58% for group IV patients. Distant failure was the most common type of failure among group IV patients.

The MBD4 Glu346Lys polymorphism is associated with the risk of cervical cancer in a Chinese population.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2012-11-01,"Methyl-CpG binding domain 4 (MBD4) protein functions as a DNA repair enzyme and plays an important role in maintaining genome integrity and carcinogenesis. The polymorphisms in the MBD4 gene may be associated with differences in DNA repair capacity and thereby influence an individual's susceptibility to cervical cancer. To verify this hypothesis, we examined the potential association between the MBD4 Glu346Lys polymorphism (rs140693, G>A) and the risk of cervical cancer in a Chinese population. We genotyped the MBD4 Glu346Lys polymorphism in 146 cervical cancer cases and 320 healthy female subjects using polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association between the genotypes and the risk of cervical cancer. We observed a significantly decreased risk of cervical cancer associated with the heterozygous Lys/Glu genotype (odds ratio [OR], 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36-0.99; P = 0.046) and the homozygous Glu/Glu genotype (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.30-0.89; P = 0.018), compared with the Lys/Lys homozygotes. Moreover, the reduced cervical cancer risk was more predominant among younger subjects or human papillomavirus-positive individuals carrying Glu/Glu genotypes (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.14-0.78, P = 0.011; and OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.09-0.75, P = 0.013, respectively).

Analgesic and antiemetic requirements after minimally invasive surgery for early cervical cancer: a comparison between laparoscopy and robotic surgery.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2012-10-05,"Women with early cervical cancer undergoing radical hysterectomy via minimally invasive surgery (MIS) have decreased blood loss and a shorter hospital stay compared with laparotomy. It remains unclear whether there is a difference in benefit to the patient between robotic surgery and traditional laparoscopy. We sought to compare postoperative analgesic and antiemetic requirements between the two approaches. After institutional review board approval, the medication administration records of all patients who underwent MIS radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer at MD Anderson Cancer Center were reviewed. Analgesic and antiemetic medication use as well as visual pain scores was recorded. Descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests were used to compare the groups undergoing laparoscopy (LRH) and robotic surgery (RRH). A total of 85 patients underwent MIS for early cervical cancer, 55 LRH and 30 RRH. Median age was older in the RRH (42 vs. 52 years, p = 0.001).

A modified Latent Class Model assessment of human papillomavirus-based screening tests for cervical lesions in women with atypical glandular cells: a Gynecologic Oncology Group study.,Cancer causes & control : CCC,Cancer Causes Control,2012-10-17,"In the absence of gold standard diagnoses, we estimate age-specific false-positive and false-negative prediction rates of HPV-, cytology-, and histology-based tests for significant cervical lesions (SCL) in US women with AGC-NOS Pap smear diagnoses. Modified Latent Class Model (LCM) analyses, with prevalence of SCL modeled as a function of age, were applied to GOG-0171 study data (n = 122). The accuracies of several HPV-based tests, including Hybrid Capture II high-risk HPV (HC2 H-HPV); carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-IX); and invasive histological diagnosis, were compared. 1-PPV and 1-NPV were written as functions of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence to obtain age-specific false-positive and false-negative rates. The histology-based test was nearly perfect (sensitivity = 1.00, CI = 0.98-1.00; specificity = 0.99, CI = 0.96-1.00). Otherwise, HC2 H-HPV performed best (sensitivity = 1.00, CI = 1.00-1.00; specificity = 0.87, CI = 0.79-0.94). The false-positive detection rates (1-PPV) for HC2 H-HPV were high (>17 %) at each age, while those of the histological diagnoses were low (<5 % at ages ≤60 and <17 % overall ages). False-negative prediction rates (1-NPV) for HC2 H-HPV were <0.11 % at each age and were uniformly lower than those of other tests, including the histology-based test (<0.25 %). CA-IX together with HC2 H-HPV did not improve performance.

The zinc finger protein ZNF268 is overexpressed in human cervical cancer and contributes to tumorigenesis via enhancing NF-κB signaling.,The Journal of biological chemistry,J. Biol. Chem.,2012-10-22,"Cervical cancer is one of the most common tumors affecting women's health worldwide. Although human papillomavirus can be detected in nearly all cases, the mechanism of cervical carcinogenesis remains to be further addressed. Here, we demonstrated that ZNF268, a Krüppel-associated box-containing zinc finger protein, might contribute to the development of cervical cancer. We found that ZNF268b2, an isoform of ZNF268, was overexpressed in human squamous cervical cancer specimens. Knockdown of ZNF268 in cervical cancer cells caused cell cycle arrest at the G(0)/G(1) phase, reduced colony formation, and increased sensitivity to TNFα-induced apoptosis. In addition, HeLa cell growth in xenograft nude mice was suppressed by ZNF268 knockdown, with increased apoptosis. Furthermore, ZNF268b2 was shown to increase NF-κB signaling in vitro and in vivo. Reconstitution of NF-κB activity restored proliferation in ZNF268 knockdown HeLa cells. Of note, we observed a high frequency of NF-κB activation in ZNF268-overexpressing cervical cancer tissues, suggesting a pathological coincidence of ZNF268b2 overexpression and NF-κB activation.

Cancer Res.,2012-11-07,"This study was designed to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to evaluate tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of etirinotecan pegol. Patients with refractory solid malignancies were enrolled and assigned to escalating-dose cohorts. Patients received 1 infusion of etirinotecan pegol weekly 3 times every 4 weeks (w × 3q4w), or every 14 days (q14d), or every 21 days (q21d), with MTD as the primary end point using a standard 3 + 3 design. Seventy-six patients were entered onto 3 dosing schedules (58-245 mg/m(2)). The MTD was 115 mg/m(2) for the w × 3q4w schedule and 145 mg/m(2) for both the q14d and q21d schedules. Most adverse events related to study drug were gastrointestinal disorders and were more frequent at higher doses of etirinotecan pegol. Late onset diarrhea was observed in some patients, the frequency of which generally correlated with dose density. Cholinergic diarrhea commonly seen with irinotecan treatment did not occur in patients treated with etirinotecan pegol. Etirinotecan pegol administration resulted in sustained and controlled systemic exposure to SN-38, which had a mean half-life of approximately 50 days. Overall, the pharmacokinetics of etirinotecan pegol are predictable and do not require complex dosing adjustments. Confirmed partial responses were observed in 8 patients with breast, colon, lung (small and squamous cell), bladder, cervical, and neuroendocrine cancer. Etirinotecan pegol showed substantial antitumor activity in patients with various solid tumors and a somewhat different safety profile compared with the irinotecan historical profile.

A retrospective review was conducted of patients undergoing radical hysterectomy from 2000 to 2010 with Stage IA2-IIA cervical cancer. CSM were defined as ≤5mm; association with other clinicopathologic factors as well as recurrence and survival was evaluated. Of the 119 patients, 75 (63%) with CSM had a recurrence rate of 24% compared to 9% without CSM. Though not independently associated with recurrence, CSM were significantly associated with positive lymph nodes (44% vs. 18%), positive parametria (33.3% vs. 2.3%), larger tumors (3.5 vs. 2.5cm), greater depth of stromal invasion (DOI) (84% vs. 33%), and lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) (61.3% vs. 34.1%). We failed to find an association between adjuvant therapy and recurrence in those with CSM. Exploratory analysis revealed that a surgical margin of ≤2mm was significantly associated with an increased risk of overall recurrence (36% vs. 9%, p=0.009) as well as loco-regional recurrence (22% vs. 4%, p=0.0034). Surgical margins of ≤5mm on radical hysterectomy specimens are often associated with other high or intermediate risk factors for recurrence. While not a proven independent risk factor, the distance to surgical margin may warrant further investigation as an intermediate risk factor along with tumor size, DOI and LVSI.",Journal Article,2633.0,17.0,While it is known that positive surgical margins increase the risk of cancer recurrence little is known about the effect of close surgical margins CSM Therefore we set out to determine the impact of margin status on recurrence and survival in patients with early-stage cancer A retrospective review was conducted of patients undergoing radical hysterectomy from 2000 to 2010 with Stage IA2-IIA cancer CSM were defined as ≤5mm association with other clinicopathologic factors as well as recurrence and survival was evaluated Of the 119 patients 75 63 with CSM had a recurrence rate of 24 compared to 9 without CSM Though not independently associated with recurrence CSM were significantly associated with positive lymph nodes 44 vs. 18 positive parametria 33.3 vs. 2.3 larger tumors 3.5 vs. 2.5cm greater depth of stromal invasion DOI 84 vs. 33 and lymphovascular space invasion LVSI 61.3 vs. 34.1 We failed to find an association between adjuvant therapy and recurrence in those with CSM Exploratory analysis revealed that a surgical margin of ≤2mm was significantly associated with an increased risk of overall recurrence 36 vs. 9 p=0.009 as well as loco-regional recurrence 22 vs. 4 p=0.0034 Surgical margins of ≤5mm on radical hysterectomy specimens are often associated with other high or intermediate risk factors for recurrence While not a proven independent risk factor the distance to surgical margin may warrant further investigation as an intermediate risk factor along with tumor size DOI and LVSI,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[369, 192, 16, 440, 17, 109, 221, 1012, 344, 3, 43, 1, 12, 146, 1215, 16, 440, 545, 3, 254, 1, 2336, 221, 1012, 7079, 673, 21, 916, 1205, 6, 223, 3, 345, 1, 959, 156, 23, 146, 2, 25, 4, 7, 5, 191, 82, 12, 8, 459, 206, 10, 426, 1, 7, 479, 711, 2622, 29, 1081, 6, 1120, 5, 82, 16725, 4088, 12, 7079, 11, 395, 22, 40169, 248, 5, 127, 1399, 130, 22, 149, 22, 146, 2, 25, 10, 194, 1, 3, 4299, 7, 481, 676, 5, 7079, 42, 8, 146, 116, 1, 259, 72, 6, 83, 187, 7079, 2471, 44, 1042, 41, 5, 146, 7079, 11, 97, 41, 5, 109, 263, 502, 584, 105, 203, 109, 19585, 466, 27, 105, 18, 27, 1077, 57, 27, 33, 105, 18, 18615, 378, 2436, 1, 1126, 578, 13105, 874, 105, 466, 2, 2933, 3865, 578, 8004, 713, 27, 105, 562, 14, 21, 1551, 6, 2469, 35, 248, 59, 249, 36, 2, 146, 4, 135, 5, 7079, 2386, 65, 553, 17, 8, 221, 959, 1, 62094, 10, 97, 41, 5, 35, 101, 43, 1, 63, 146, 511, 105, 83, 19, 13, 2376, 22, 149, 22, 7214, 951, 146, 350, 105, 39, 19, 13, 19746, 221, 1012, 1, 40169, 23, 711, 2622, 623, 32, 629, 41, 5, 127, 64, 15, 919, 43, 130, 9, 146, 369, 44, 8, 1930, 306, 43, 161, 3, 3019, 6, 221, 959, 68, 2946, 195, 940, 22, 35, 919, 43, 161, 1510, 5, 30, 444, 13105, 2, 8004]",1508.0,23138134,565
Postoperative pelvic intensity-modulated radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy in intermediate- and high-risk cervical cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2012-11-15,"According to national surveys, the use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in gynecologic cancers is on the rise, yet there is still some reluctance to adopt adjuvant IMRT as standard practice. The purpose of this study is to report a single-institution experience using postoperative pelvic IMRT with concurrent chemotherapy in intermediate- and high-risk early stage cervical cancer. From 1/2004 to 12/2009, 34 patients underwent radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection (28 median nodes were removed) for early stage cervical cancer. Median dose of postoperative pelvic IMRT was 50.4 Gy (range, 45-50.4). All patients received concurrent cisplatin. With a median follow-up of 44 months, 3 patients have recurred; 1 vaginal recurrence, 1 regional and distant, and 1 distant. The 3- and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 91.2% (95% CI, 81.4-100%) and overall survival (OS) was 91.1% (95% CI, 81.3-100%). All failures and all deaths were in the high-risk group (n=3/26). There was 32.3% G3-4 hematologic toxicity, 2.9% acute G3 gastrointestinal toxicity, and no acute G3 or higher genitourinary toxicity. There were no chronic G3 or higher toxicities. Oncologic outcomes with postoperative IMRT were very good, with DFS and OS rates of >90% at median follow-up of 44 months, despite a preponderance (76.5%) of high-risk features.

"Single-fraction radiotherapy versus multifraction radiotherapy for palliation of painful vertebral bone metastases-equivalent efficacy, less toxicity, more convenient: a subset analysis of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trial 97-14.",Cancer,Cancer,2012-11-16,"The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trial 97-14 revealed no difference between radiation delivered for painful bone metastases at a dose of 8 gray (Gy) in 1 fraction (single-fraction radiotherapy [SFRT]) and 30 Gy in 10 fractions (multifraction radiotherapy [MFRT]) in pain relief or narcotic use 3 months after randomization. SFRT for painful vertebral bone metastases (PVBM) has not been well accepted, possibly because of concerns about efficacy and toxicity. In the current study, the authors evaluated the subset of patients that was treated specifically for patients with PVBM. PVBM included the cervical, thoracic, and/or lumbar spine regions. Among patients with PVBM, differences in retreatment rates and in pain relief, narcotic use, and toxicity 3 months after randomization were evaluated. Of 909 eligible patients, 235 (26%) had PVBM. Patients with and without PVBM differed in terms of the percentage of men (55% vs 47%, respectively; P = .03) and the proportion of patients with multiple painful sites (57% vs 38%, respectively; P < .01). Among those with PVBM, more patients who received MFRT had multiple sites treated (65% vs 49% for MFRT vs SFRT, respectively; P = .02). There were no statistically significant treatment differences in terms of pain relief (62% vs 70% for MFRT vs SFRT, respectively; P = .59) or freedom from narcotic use (24% vs 27%, respectively; P = .76) at 3 months. Significant differences in acute grade 2 through 4 toxicity (20% vs 10% for MFRT vs SFRT, respectively; P = .01) and acute grade 2 through 4 gastrointestinal toxicity (14% vs 6%, respectively; P = .01) were observed at 3 months, with lower toxicities seen in the patients treated with SFRT. Late toxicity was rare. No myelopathy was recorded. SFRT produced higher 3-year retreatment rates (5% vs 15%; P = .01). Results for the subset of patients with PVBM in the RTOG 94-17 randomized controlled trial were comparable to those for the entire population.

(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate induces apoptosis and inhibits invasion and migration of human cervical cancer cells.,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,Asian Pac. J. Cancer Prev.,2012-01-01,"Invasion and metastasis are the major causes of cancer-related death. Pharmacological or therapeutic interventions such as chemoprevention of the progression stages of neoplastic development could result in substantial reduction in the incidence of cancer mortality. (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a promising chemopreventive agent, has attracted extensive interest for cancer therapy utilizing its antioxidant, anti- proliferative and inhibitory effects on angiogenesis and tumor cell invasion. In this study, we assessed the influence of EGCG on the proliferative potential of HeLa cells by cell viability assay and authenticated the results by nuclear morphological examination, DNA laddering assay and cell cycle analysis. Further we analyzed the anti-invasive properties of EGCG by wound migration assay and gene expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in HeLa cells.

"Molecular diagnostics, personalized medicine, and the evolving role of the cytotechnologist: an institutional experience.",Acta cytologica,Acta Cytol.,2012-11-24,"The role of cytotechnologists has focused primarily on the microscopic examination of cytologic specimens for diagnosing disease. Cytotechnologists currently evaluate a wide assortment of both gynecological and nongynecological cytology specimens. However, the Pap test remains the primary test for most cytology laboratories. Recently, human papillomavirus testing and newer cervical cancer screening guidelines have reduced the number of Pap tests, resulting in some anxiety and concern among the cytology community. However, as Pap test volumes continue to decrease, molecular oncology and ancillary testing volumes continue to increase with the advent of new biomarkers and associated personalized therapies. This change in clinical practice has resulted in evolving roles for many cytotechnologists. Cytotechnologists have skills based not only in morphology but also in understanding concepts of disease including neoplasia. These skills allow cytotechnologists to excel in many other types of laboratory testing. This article discusses how the roles of the cytotechnologist have recently expanded at our institution to include involvement in DNA ploidy analysis, quantitative immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization, circulating tumor cells, and molecular oncology testing.

Tumor suppressor function of the plasma glutathione peroxidase gpx3 in colitis-associated carcinoma.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2012-12-05,"The glutathione peroxidases, a family of selenocysteine-containing redox enzymes, play pivotal roles in balancing the signaling, immunomodulatory, and deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The glutathione peroxidase GPX3 is the only extracellular member of this family, suggesting it may defend cells against ROS in the extracellular environment. Notably, GPX3 hypermethylation and underexpression occur commonly in prostate, gastric, cervical, thyroid, and colon cancers. We took a reverse genetics approach to investigate whether GPX3 would augment inflammatory colonic tumorigenesis, a process characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation, comparing Gpx3(-/-) mice in an established two-stage model of inflammatory colon carcinogenesis. Gpx3-deficient mice exhibited an increased tumor number, though not size, along with a higher degree of dysplasia. In addition, they exhibited increased inflammation with redistribution toward protumorigenic M2 macrophage subsets, increased proliferation, hyperactive WNT signaling, and increased DNA damage. To determine the impact of acute gene loss in an established colon cancer line, we silenced GPX3 in human Caco2 cells, resulting in increased ROS production, DNA damage and apoptosis in response to oxidative stress, combined with decreased contact-independent growth. Taken together, our results suggested an immunomodulatory role for GPX3 that limits the development of colitis-associated carcinoma.",Journal Article,2603.0,69.0,The glutathione peroxidases a family of selenocysteine-containing redox enzymes play pivotal roles in balancing the signaling immunomodulatory and deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species ROS The glutathione peroxidase GPX3 is the only extracellular member of this family suggesting it may defend cells against ROS in the extracellular environment Notably GPX3 hypermethylation and underexpression occur commonly in and cancers We took a reverse genetics approach to investigate whether GPX3 would augment inflammatory colonic tumorigenesis a process characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation comparing Gpx3 -/- mice in an established two-stage model of inflammatory carcinogenesis Gpx3-deficient mice exhibited an increased tumor number though not size along with a higher degree of dysplasia In addition they exhibited increased inflammation with redistribution toward protumorigenic M2 macrophage subsets increased proliferation hyperactive WNT signaling and increased DNA damage To determine the impact of acute gene loss in an established cancer line we silenced GPX3 in human Caco2 cells resulting in increased ROS production DNA damage and apoptosis in response to oxidative stress combined with decreased contact-independent growth Taken together our results suggested an immunomodulatory role for GPX3 that limits the development of colitis-associated carcinoma,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,"[3, 4571, 62179, 8, 607, 1, 32054, 1101, 7237, 3039, 1343, 3754, 1790, 4, 13013, 3, 314, 2555, 2, 3586, 176, 1, 2163, 2848, 2915, 2609, 3, 4571, 14747, 18037, 16, 3, 158, 1976, 2693, 1, 26, 607, 802, 192, 68, 38012, 37, 480, 2609, 4, 3, 1976, 3087, 2552, 18037, 2575, 2, 22250, 1271, 841, 4, 2, 163, 21, 5060, 8, 1772, 2894, 353, 6, 963, 317, 18037, 688, 4369, 1291, 3663, 1565, 8, 1129, 765, 20, 3495, 1531, 2, 1815, 1430, 18037, 399, 4, 35, 635, 100, 82, 202, 1, 1291, 1719, 18037, 1971, 399, 1416, 35, 101, 30, 207, 2471, 44, 444, 1510, 5, 8, 142, 1444, 1, 2253, 4, 352, 491, 1416, 101, 1815, 5, 12507, 1317, 11840, 821, 2674, 1890, 101, 457, 11802, 2112, 314, 2, 101, 261, 1350, 6, 223, 3, 345, 1, 286, 145, 407, 4, 35, 635, 12, 328, 21, 5442, 18037, 4, 171, 26171, 37, 1113, 4, 101, 2609, 1529, 261, 1350, 2, 351, 4, 51, 6, 3495, 1531, 397, 5, 340, 4393, 306, 129, 1633, 1162, 114, 99, 1148, 35, 2555, 200, 9, 18037, 17, 3526, 3, 193, 1, 4132, 41, 134]",1385.0,23221387,31

Evaluation of DNA from the Papanicolaou test to detect ovarian and endometrial cancers.,Science translational medicine,Sci Transl Med,2013-01-01,"Papanicolaou (Pap) smears have revolutionized the management of patients with cervical cancers by permitting the detection of early, surgically curable tumors and their precursors. In recent years, the traditional Pap smear has been replaced by a liquid-based method, which allows not only cytologic evaluation but also collection of DNA for detection of human papillomavirus, the causative agent of cervical cancer. We reasoned that this routinely collected DNA could be exploited to detect somatic mutations present in rare tumor cells that accumulate in the cervix once shed from endometrial or ovarian cancers. A panel of genes that are commonly mutated in endometrial and ovarian cancers was assembled with new whole-exome sequencing data from 22 endometrial cancers and previously published data on other tumor types. We used this panel to search for mutations in 24 endometrial and 22 ovarian cancers and identified mutations in all 46 samples. With a sensitive massively parallel sequencing method, we were able to identify the same mutations in the DNA from liquid Pap smear specimens in 100% of endometrial cancers (24 of 24) and in 41% of ovarian cancers (9 of 22). Prompted by these findings, we developed a sequence-based method to query mutations in 12 genes in a single liquid Pap smear specimen without previous knowledge of the tumor's genotype. When applied to 14 samples selected from the positive cases described above, the expected tumor-specific mutations were identified. These results demonstrate that DNA from most endometrial and a fraction of ovarian cancers can be detected in a standard liquid-based Pap smear specimen obtained during routine pelvic examination. Although improvements need to be made before applying this test in a routine clinical manner, it represents a promising step toward a broadly applicable screening methodology for the early detection of gynecologic malignancies.",Evaluation Study,2576.0,161.0,Papanicolaou Pap smears have revolutionized the management of patients with cancers by permitting the detection of early surgically curable tumors and their precursors In recent years the traditional Pap smear has been replaced by a liquid-based method which allows not only cytologic evaluation but also collection of DNA for detection of human papillomavirus the causative agent of cancer We reasoned that this routinely collected DNA could be exploited to detect somatic mutations present in rare tumor cells that accumulate in the cervix once shed from or cancers A panel of genes that are commonly mutated in and cancers was assembled with new whole-exome sequencing data from 22 cancers and previously published data on other tumor types We used this panel to search for mutations in 24 and 22 cancers and identified mutations in all 46 samples With a sensitive massively parallel sequencing method we were able to identify the same mutations in the DNA from liquid Pap smear specimens in 100 of cancers 24 of 24 and in 41 of cancers 9 of 22 Prompted by these findings we developed a sequence-based method to query mutations in 12 genes in a single liquid Pap smear specimen without previous knowledge of the tumor 's genotype When applied to 14 samples selected from the positive cases described above the expected tumor-specific mutations were identified These results demonstrate that DNA from most and a fraction of cancers can be detected in a standard liquid-based Pap smear specimen obtained during routine pelvic examination Although improvements need to be made before applying this test in a routine clinical manner it represents a promising step toward a broadly applicable screening methodology for the early detection of gynecologic malignancies,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[10416, 4290, 8916, 47, 5746, 3, 284, 1, 7, 5, 163, 20, 9621, 3, 638, 1, 191, 2350, 4151, 57, 2, 136, 4881, 4, 435, 60, 3, 1847, 4290, 8379, 71, 85, 6928, 20, 8, 3165, 90, 596, 92, 2333, 44, 158, 4195, 451, 84, 120, 2442, 1, 261, 9, 638, 1, 171, 3242, 3, 8088, 420, 1, 12, 21, 15577, 17, 26, 3066, 786, 261, 359, 40, 5177, 6, 1426, 1119, 138, 364, 4, 622, 30, 37, 17, 7859, 4, 3, 3629, 1059, 5816, 29, 15, 163, 8, 993, 1, 214, 17, 32, 841, 1185, 4, 2, 163, 10, 6154, 5, 217, 902, 2865, 615, 74, 29, 350, 163, 2, 373, 983, 74, 23, 127, 30, 630, 21, 95, 26, 993, 6, 1901, 9, 138, 4, 259, 2, 350, 163, 2, 108, 138, 4, 62, 641, 347, 5, 8, 745, 7284, 2755, 615, 596, 21, 11, 1665, 6, 255, 3, 827, 138, 4, 3, 261, 29, 3165, 4290, 8379, 623, 4, 394, 1, 163, 259, 1, 259, 2, 4, 605, 1, 163, 83, 1, 350, 4140, 20, 46, 272, 21, 276, 8, 1532, 90, 596, 6, 12259, 138, 4, 133, 214, 4, 8, 226, 3165, 4290, 8379, 2360, 187, 698, 922, 1, 3, 30, 292, 1183, 198, 1498, 6, 213, 347, 715, 29, 3, 109, 140, 1027, 2090, 3, 1336, 30, 112, 138, 11, 108, 46, 99, 608, 17, 261, 29, 96, 2, 8, 1509, 1, 163, 122, 40, 530, 4, 8, 260, 3165, 90, 4290, 8379, 2360, 683, 190, 1311, 1110, 1385, 242, 1474, 594, 6, 40, 1229, 348, 4798, 26, 412, 4, 8, 1311, 38, 1708, 192, 1449, 8, 721, 2458, 1317, 8, 5482, 3801, 453, 3209, 9, 3, 191, 638, 1, 1512, 441]",1764.0,23303603,642

Anatomic distribution of fluorodeoxyglucose-avid para-aortic lymph nodes in patients with cervical cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2013-01-17,"Conformal treatment of para-aortic lymph nodes (PAN) in cervical cancer allows dose escalation and reduces normal tissue toxicity. Currently, data documenting the precise location of involved PAN are lacking. We define the spatial distribution of this high-risk nodal volume by analyzing fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid lymph nodes (LNs) on positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scans in patients with cervical cancer. We identified 72 PANs on pretreatment PET/CT of 30 patients with newly diagnosed stage IB-IVA cervical cancer treated with definitive chemoradiation. LNs were classified as left-lateral para-aortic (LPA), aortocaval (AC), or right paracaval (RPC). Distances from the LN center to the closest vessel and adjacent vertebral body were calculated. Using deformable image registration, nodes were mapped to a template computed tomogram to provide a visual impression of nodal frequencies and anatomic distribution. We identified 72 PET-positive para-aortic lymph nodes (37 LPA, 32 AC, 3 RPC). All RPC lymph nodes were in the inferior third of the para-aortic region. The mean distance from aorta for all lymph nodes was 8.3 mm (range, 3-17 mm), and from the inferior vena cava was 5.6 mm (range, 2-10 mm). Of the 72 lymph nodes, 60% were in the inferior third, 36% were in the middle third, and 4% were in the upper third of the para-aortic region. In all, 29 of 30 patients also had FDG-avid pelvic lymph nodes. A total of 96% of PET positive nodes were adjacent to the aorta; PET positive nodes to the right of the IVC were rare and were all located distally, within 3 cm of the aortic bifurcation. Our findings suggest that circumferential margins around the vessels do not accurately define the nodal region at risk. Instead, the anatomical extent of the nodal basin should be contoured on each axial image to provide optimal coverage of the para-aortic nodal compartment.",Journal Article,2560.0,13.0,Conformal treatment of para-aortic lymph nodes PAN in cancer allows dose escalation and reduces normal tissue toxicity Currently data documenting the precise location of involved PAN are lacking We define the spatial distribution of this high-risk nodal volume by analyzing fluorodeoxyglucose FDG -avid lymph nodes LNs on positron emission tomography/computed tomography PET/CT scans in patients with cancer We identified 72 PANs on pretreatment PET/CT of 30 patients with newly diagnosed stage IB-IVA cancer treated with definitive chemoradiation LNs were classified as left-lateral para-aortic LPA aortocaval AC or right paracaval RPC Distances from the LN center to the closest vessel and adjacent vertebral body were calculated Using deformable image registration nodes were mapped to a template computed tomogram to provide a visual impression of nodal frequencies and anatomic distribution We identified 72 PET-positive para-aortic lymph nodes 37 LPA 32 AC 3 RPC All RPC lymph nodes were in the inferior third of the para-aortic region The mean distance from aorta for all lymph nodes was 8.3 mm range 3-17 mm and from the inferior vena cava was 5.6 mm range 2-10 mm Of the 72 lymph nodes 60 were in the inferior third 36 were in the middle third and 4 were in the upper third of the para-aortic region In all 29 of 30 patients also had FDG-avid pelvic lymph nodes A total of 96 of PET positive nodes were adjacent to the aorta PET positive nodes to the right of the IVC were rare and were all located distally within 3 cm of the aortic bifurcation Our findings suggest that circumferential margins around the vessels do not accurately define the nodal region at risk Instead the anatomical extent of the nodal basin should be contoured on each axial image to provide optimal coverage of the para-aortic nodal compartment,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[2972, 24, 1, 4615, 3938, 263, 502, 3055, 4, 12, 2333, 61, 1125, 2, 2389, 295, 246, 155, 694, 74, 9255, 3, 3260, 1147, 1, 646, 3055, 32, 1941, 21, 1107, 3, 5104, 1395, 1, 26, 64, 43, 779, 433, 20, 4449, 4085, 1285, 5189, 263, 502, 2704, 23, 1900, 1799, 872, 1220, 872, 495, 425, 1441, 4, 7, 5, 12, 21, 108, 720, 22776, 23, 1194, 495, 425, 1, 201, 7, 5, 732, 265, 82, 3180, 5900, 12, 73, 5, 1057, 975, 2704, 11, 1373, 22, 1712, 3855, 4615, 3938, 7504, 17414, 1948, 15, 1913, 38371, 30698, 11022, 29, 3, 1763, 574, 6, 3, 12197, 3685, 2, 2086, 4731, 642, 11, 981, 75, 10491, 1482, 3169, 502, 11, 6224, 6, 8, 5932, 1220, 46015, 6, 377, 8, 3046, 8925, 1, 779, 2722, 2, 2745, 1395, 21, 108, 720, 495, 109, 4615, 3938, 263, 502, 567, 7504, 531, 1948, 27, 30698, 62, 30698, 263, 502, 11, 4, 3, 1663, 1282, 1, 3, 4615, 3938, 1053, 3, 313, 3019, 29, 14164, 9, 62, 263, 502, 10, 66, 27, 321, 184, 27, 269, 321, 2, 29, 3, 1663, 6693, 7294, 10, 33, 49, 321, 184, 18, 79, 321, 1, 3, 720, 263, 502, 335, 11, 4, 3, 1663, 1282, 511, 11, 4, 3, 3897, 1282, 2, 39, 11, 4, 3, 1726, 1282, 1, 3, 4615, 3938, 1053, 4, 62, 462, 1, 201, 7, 120, 42, 1285, 5189, 1110, 263, 502, 8, 181, 1, 921, 1, 495, 109, 502, 11, 2086, 6, 3, 14164, 495, 109, 502, 6, 3, 1913, 1, 3, 7818, 11, 622, 2, 11, 62, 2308, 17743, 262, 27, 494, 1, 3, 3938, 18788, 114, 272, 309, 17, 7937, 1012, 3337, 3, 3102, 1022, 44, 2141, 1107, 3, 779, 1053, 28, 43, 3496, 3, 5024, 1039, 1, 3, 779, 6969, 257, 40, 6476, 23, 296, 5229, 1482, 6, 377, 665, 2139, 1, 3, 4615, 3938, 779, 3616]",1827.0,23332221,378
Cervical cancer screening and prevention in low-resource settings.,Clinical obstetrics and gynecology,Clin Obstet Gynecol,2013-03-01,"Cervical cancer is both preventable and curable, yet it remains one of the leading causes of mortality in women worldwide. Approximately 88% of cervical cancer cases are diagnosed in low-resource countries, yet very few resources are allocated to prevention and treatment programs. In fact, it is estimated that only 5% of women in low-resources countries are screened appropriately for cervical cancer.

Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the uterine cervix: the role of multimodality therapy in early-stage disease.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2013-01-26,"Neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) of the cervix comprise only 2% of all cervical cancers. Prospective data is limited and treatment guidelines rely on retrospective reviews and literature from lung NEC. The objective of this study was to report our experience in the management of this rare disease. This was an IRB-approved retrospective review. Study criteria included patients with cervical NEC diagnosed between 1990 and 2012. Demographic, treatment and survival data was collected. Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed. Twenty-six patients met inclusion criteria. Advanced-stage disease (II-IV) was diagnosed in 58% (n=15) of patients. Of the eleven patients with stage I disease, five were treated with platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), six with initial radical surgery, and seven received adjuvant therapy including chemotherapy and/or radiation. Nine patients (82%) are currently without evidence of disease (NED). Patients with stage I disease had significantly improved PFS and OS compared to stages II-IV with a median OS that was not reached and 12.1 months, respectively (p=0.0013). The majority of stage I patients with lymph node metastasis and large tumors achieved durable remission with triple-modality therapy including NACT and surgery followed by adjuvant therapy. Cervical NEC is an aggressive disease associated with a high mortality rate. Patients with advanced-stage disease have a poor prognosis regardless of therapy.

J. Gynecol. Cancer,2013-03-01,"The objective of this study was to compare morbidity and outcome following radical surgery with or without adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) in the treatment of stages IB1-IB2 cervical carcinoma. We retrospectively identified 222 patients with stages IB1-IB2 cervical carcinoma treated initially with radical hysterectomy or radical trachelectomy with or without adjuvant RT from February 2000 to November 2009. All grade 3 or higher complications-those requiring interventional radiology, endoscopic evaluation, or operative intervention-were documented. One hundred fifty-eight patients (71%) underwent radical hysterectomy; 64 (29%) underwent radical trachelectomy. One hundred fifty-three patients (69%) underwent surgery alone; 69 (31%) received adjuvant radiation with or without chemosensitization. There was a statistically significant difference in the rate of total grades 1 to 5 late complications between the surgery-alone and surgery + RT groups (12% vs 32%, respectively; P < 0.001); however, the rate of grade 3 or higher complications was similar (5% vs 4%, respectively; P = 0.999). The progression-free and overall survival rates of the entire cohort were both 95%. The 5-year progression-free survival rates for the surgery-alone and surgery + RT groups were 93% and 90% (P = 0.172). The overall survival rates were 96% and 91%, respectively (P = 0.332).

External validation of a prognostic nomogram for overall survival in women with uterine leiomyosarcoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2013-03-01,"There is no validated system to identify prognostically distinct cohorts of women with uterine leiomyosarcoma (ULMS). By using an independent, pooled, multi-institutional, international patient cohort, the authors validated a recently proposed ULMS nomogram. The ULMS nomogram incorporated 7 clinical characteristics (age, tumor size, tumor grade, cervical involvement, locoregional metastases, distant metastases, and mitotic index (per 10 high-power fields) to predict overall survival (OS) after primary surgery. Independent cohorts from 2 sarcoma centers were included. Eligible women, at minimum, underwent a hysterectomy for primary, locally advanced, or metastatic ULMS and received part of their care at 1 of the centers between 1994 and 2010. In total, 187 women with ULMS were identified who met the above criteria described above (median age, 51 years; median tumor size, 9 cm; median mitotic index, 20 per 10 high-power fields). Tumors generally were high grade (88%), FIGO stage I or II (61%) without cervical involvement (93%) and without locoregional metastases (77%) or distant metastases (83%). The median OS and the 5-year OS rate were 4.5 years (95% confidence interval, 3.2-5.3 years) and 46%, respectively; and 65 women (35%) remained alive at last follow-up. The nomogram concordance index was 0.67(standard error, 0.02), which was as high as the concordance index from the initial cohort used for nomogram development. The concordance between actual OS and nomogram predictions suggests excellent calibration because predictions were within 1% of actual 5-year OS rates for patients with a predicted 5-year OS of less than 0.68. The ULMS nomogram was externally validated using independent cohorts.

Anti-PD-1 blockade and stereotactic radiation produce long-term survival in mice with intracranial gliomas.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2013-02-22,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults, and radiation is one of the main treatment modalities. However, cure rates remain low despite best available therapies. Immunotherapy is a promising modality that could work synergistically with radiation, which has been shown to increase antigen presentation and promote a proinflammatory tumor microenvironment. Programmed-death-1 (PD-1) is a surface receptor expressed on activated and exhausted T cells, which mediate T cell inhibition upon binding with its ligand PD-L1, expressed on many tumor types including human GBMs. We tested the combination of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy with stereotactic radiosurgery in a mouse orthotopic GBM model. We performed intracranial implantation of mouse glioma cell line GL261 transfected with luciferase into C57BL/6 mice. Mice were stratified into 4 treatment groups: (1) control; (2) radiation only; (3) anti-PD-1 antibody only; and (4) radiation plus anti-PD-1 antibody. Overall survival was quantified. The mice were killed on day 21 after implantation to assess immunologic parameters in the brain/tumor, cervical lymph nodes, and spleen. Improved survival was demonstrated with combination anti-PD-1 therapy plus radiation compared with either modality alone: median survival was 25 days in the control arm, 27 days in the anti-PD-1 antibody arm, 28 days in the radiation arm, and 53 days in the radiation plus anti-PD-1 therapy arm (P<.05 by log-rank Mantle-Cox). Long-term survival was seen only in the combined treatment arm, with a fraction (15%-40%) of animals alive at day 180+ after treatment. Immunologic data on day 21 after implantation showed increased tumor infiltration by cytotoxic T cells (CD8+/interferon-γ+/tumor necrosis factor-α+) and decreased regulatory T cells (CD4+/FOXP3) in the combined treatment group compared with the single modality arms. The combination of PD-1 blockade and localized radiation therapy results in long-term survival in mice with orthotopic brain tumors.

"Comparative outcomes assessment of uterine grade 3 endometrioid, serous, and clear cell carcinomas.",Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2013-03-25,"The objective of this study is to assess effects of clinicopathologic risk factors and contemporary therapeutic interventions on high-risk uterine epithelial carcinoma outcomes. Patient-, disease-, and treatment-specific variables were annotated. Survival was estimated via the Kaplan-Meier method. Associations were evaluated with Cox proportional hazard regression and summarized using hazard ratios. From 1999 through 2008, therapy with curative intent was initiated for 119 grade 3 endometrioid (G3EC), 211 serous (USC), and 40 clear cell (CCC) carcinomas. Although clinicopathologic risk factors varied among the histologic subtypes, overall survival (OS) did not differ statistically between subtypes (P=.10) or in stage-for-stage comparative analyses (stage I/II, P=.45; stage III, P=.46; stage IV, P=.65). The 5-year cause-specific survival in stage I/II was 84.8%, 89.8%, and 83.9% for G3EC, USC, and CCC, respectively; multivariable modeling identified lymphovascular space involvement (LVSI) as the only independent prognostic factor (P=.02). For stage III, 5-year OS was 49.2% and 40.0% for G3EC and USC, respectively; multivariable modeling identified age (P<.001), LVSI (P<.001), unresectable nodal disease (P=.03), and regional radiotherapy (P=.01) as independent prognostic factors.

Risk of residual disease and invasive carcinoma in women treated for adenocarcinoma in situ of the cervix.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2013-03-28,"Cervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) is increasing in incidence among reproductive-age women. Cervical conization is an alternative to hysterectomy that allows future fertility, however reports regarding the risk of residual AIS and underlying adenocarcinoma are conflicting. The purpose of this study was to determine the outcomes of a large cohort of women treated for AIS. The medical records of 180 women with cervical AIS evaluated at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and its outlying clinics between 1983 and 2011 were reviewed for demographic information, treatment history, pathologic findings and outcomes. The mean age at diagnosis was 33.8years (range 17.6-76.1years). 172 of the 180 women had at least one cone biopsy performed, with 110 (64.0%) undergoing a cold knife cone (CKC), and 62 (36.0%) undergoing a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) as their initial method of treatment. Positive margins were noted in 35.0% of patients undergoing CKC compared with 55.6% undergoing LEEP (p=0.017). 71 patients ultimately underwent hysterectomy with residual disease noted in 10 patients (14.1%), 8 patients (11.3%) with residual AIS and 2 patients (2.8%) with invasive carcinoma. Of the 101 patients who did not undergo hysterectomy, 2 patients (2.0%) developed recurrent AIS at a median of 27.5months (range 18-37months) from the last cone, and none developed invasive carcinoma. Patients undergoing conservative management for AIS with cervical conization alone should be monitored closely and counseled regarding the potential risks of residual and recurrent disease, even when negative cone margins are obtained.",Journal Article,2490.0,19.0,adenocarcinoma in situ AIS is increasing in incidence among reproductive-age women conization is an alternative to hysterectomy that allows future fertility however reports regarding the risk of residual AIS and underlying adenocarcinoma are conflicting The purpose of this study was to determine the outcomes of a large cohort of women treated for AIS The medical records of 180 women with AIS evaluated at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and its outlying clinics between 1983 and 2011 were reviewed for demographic information treatment history pathologic findings and outcomes The mean age at diagnosis was 33.8years range 17.6-76.1years 172 of the 180 women had at least one cone biopsy performed with 110 64.0 undergoing a cold knife cone CKC and 62 36.0 undergoing a loop electrosurgical excision procedure LEEP as their initial method of treatment Positive margins were noted in 35.0 of patients undergoing CKC compared with 55.6 undergoing LEEP p=0.017 71 patients ultimately underwent hysterectomy with residual disease noted in 10 patients 14.1 8 patients 11.3 with residual AIS and 2 patients 2.8 with invasive carcinoma Of the 101 patients who did not undergo hysterectomy 2 patients 2.0 developed recurrent AIS at a median of 27.5months range 18-37months from the last cone and none developed invasive carcinoma Patients undergoing conservative management for AIS with conization alone should be monitored closely and counseled regarding the potential risks of residual and recurrent disease even when negative cone margins are obtained,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[449, 4, 957, 3826, 16, 602, 4, 287, 107, 3705, 89, 117, 8755, 16, 35, 1091, 6, 2622, 17, 2333, 508, 2954, 137, 1198, 666, 3, 43, 1, 753, 3826, 2, 1181, 449, 32, 4274, 3, 743, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 223, 3, 123, 1, 8, 375, 180, 1, 117, 73, 9, 3826, 3, 484, 1064, 1, 3172, 117, 5, 3826, 194, 28, 3, 1652, 1, 2738, 2244, 1929, 12, 574, 2, 211, 44048, 4736, 59, 6656, 2, 1132, 11, 446, 9, 1540, 487, 24, 532, 510, 272, 2, 123, 3, 313, 89, 28, 147, 10, 466, 29418, 184, 269, 49, 846, 29147, 5312, 1, 3, 3172, 117, 42, 28, 506, 104, 6939, 411, 173, 5, 3129, 660, 13, 479, 8, 5945, 8045, 6939, 28403, 2, 744, 511, 13, 479, 8, 4432, 24548, 1366, 1299, 19966, 22, 136, 388, 596, 1, 24, 109, 1012, 11, 1051, 4, 465, 13, 1, 7, 479, 28403, 72, 5, 614, 49, 479, 19966, 19, 13, 3825, 792, 7, 2050, 208, 2622, 5, 753, 34, 1051, 4, 79, 7, 213, 14, 66, 7, 175, 27, 5, 753, 3826, 2, 18, 7, 18, 66, 5, 416, 134, 1, 3, 2338, 7, 54, 205, 44, 1251, 2622, 18, 7, 18, 13, 276, 387, 3826, 28, 8, 52, 1, 428, 15029, 184, 203, 62656, 29, 3, 1060, 6939, 2, 1292, 276, 416, 134, 7, 479, 4476, 284, 9, 3826, 5, 8755, 279, 257, 40, 2909, 3210, 2, 10411, 666, 3, 174, 1098, 1, 753, 2, 387, 34, 871, 198, 199, 6939, 1012, 32, 683]",1567.0,23541795,480
Intraoperative Electron Beam Radiotherapy (IOERT) in the management of locally advanced or recurrent cervical cancer.,"Radiation oncology (London, England)",Radiat Oncol,2013-04-08,"To report outcomes in women with locally recurrent or advanced cervical cancer who received intraoperative electron beam radiotherapy (IOERT) as a component of therapy. From 1983 to 2010, 86 patients with locally recurrent (n = 73, 85%) or primary advanced (n = 13, 15%) cervical cancer received IOERT following surgery. Common surgeries included pelvic exenteration (n = 26; 30%) or sidewall resection (n = 22; 26%). The median IOERT dose was 15 Gy (range, 6.25-25 Gy). Sixty-one patients (71%) received perioperative external beam radiotherapy (EBRT; median dose, 45 Gy). Forty-one patients (48%) received perioperative chemotherapy. Median follow-up was 2.7 years (range, 0.1-25.5 years). Resections were classified as R0 (n = 35, 41%), R1 (n = 30, 35%), or R2 (n = 21, 24%). Cumulative incidences of central (within the IOERT field) and locoregional relapse at 3 years were 23 and 38%, respectively. The 3-year cumulative incidence of distant relapse was 43%. Median survival was 15 months, and 3-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of cause-specific (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were 31 and 25%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, pelvic exenteration (p = 0.02) and perioperative EBRT (p = 0.009) were associated with improved central control in patients with recurrent disease. Recurrence within 6 months of initial therapy was associated with reduced CSS (p = 0.001). Common IOERT-related toxicities included peripheral neuropathy (n = 16), ureteral stenosis (n = 4), and bowel fistula/perforation (n = 4). Eleven of 16 patients with neuropathy required long-term pain medication. Long-term survival is possible with combined modality therapy including IOERT for advanced cervical cancer. Distant relapse is common, yet a significant number of patients experienced local progression in spite of aggressive treatment. In addition to consideration of disease- and treatment-related morbidity, other factors to be considered when selecting patients for this approach include the time interval from initial therapy to recurrence and whether the patient is able to receive perioperative EBRT and pelvic exenteration in addition to IOERT.",Journal Article,2479.0,22.0,To report outcomes in women with locally recurrent or advanced cancer who received intraoperative electron beam radiotherapy IOERT as a component of therapy From 1983 to 2010 86 patients with locally recurrent n 73 85 or primary advanced n 13 15 cancer received IOERT following surgery Common surgeries included pelvic exenteration n 26 30 or sidewall resection n 22 26 The median IOERT dose was 15 Gy range 6.25-25 Gy Sixty-one patients 71 received perioperative external beam radiotherapy EBRT median dose 45 Gy Forty-one patients 48 received perioperative chemotherapy Median follow-up was 2.7 years range 0.1-25.5 years Resections were classified as R0 n 35 41 R1 n 30 35 or R2 n 21 24 Cumulative incidences of central within the IOERT field and locoregional relapse at 3 years were 23 and 38 respectively The 3-year cumulative incidence of distant relapse was 43 Median survival was 15 months and 3-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of cause-specific CSS and overall survival OS were 31 and 25 respectively On multivariate analysis pelvic exenteration p 0.02 and perioperative EBRT p 0.009 were associated with improved central control in patients with recurrent disease Recurrence within 6 months of initial therapy was associated with reduced CSS p 0.001 Common IOERT-related toxicities included peripheral neuropathy n 16 ureteral stenosis n 4 and bowel fistula/perforation n 4 Eleven of 16 patients with neuropathy required long-term pain medication Long-term survival is possible with combined modality therapy including IOERT for advanced cancer Distant relapse is common yet a significant number of patients experienced local progression in spite of aggressive treatment In addition to consideration of disease- and treatment-related morbidity other factors to be considered when selecting patients for this approach include the time interval from initial therapy to recurrence and whether the patient is able to receive perioperative EBRT and pelvic exenteration in addition to IOERT,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[6, 414, 123, 4, 117, 5, 795, 387, 15, 131, 12, 54, 103, 1720, 4560, 1345, 310, 8366, 22, 8, 1249, 1, 36, 29, 6656, 6, 1120, 868, 7, 5, 795, 387, 78, 803, 772, 15, 86, 131, 78, 233, 167, 12, 103, 8366, 366, 152, 186, 5305, 159, 1110, 5668, 78, 432, 201, 15, 12599, 170, 78, 350, 432, 3, 52, 8366, 61, 10, 167, 381, 184, 49, 243, 243, 381, 1746, 104, 7, 792, 103, 1547, 1455, 1345, 310, 1883, 52, 61, 512, 381, 1213, 104, 7, 576, 103, 1547, 56, 52, 166, 126, 10, 18, 67, 60, 184, 13, 14, 243, 33, 60, 2185, 11, 1373, 22, 2328, 78, 465, 605, 3239, 78, 201, 465, 15, 4332, 78, 239, 259, 967, 3981, 1, 854, 262, 3, 8366, 1067, 2, 1325, 429, 28, 27, 60, 11, 382, 2, 519, 106, 3, 27, 111, 967, 287, 1, 626, 429, 10, 601, 52, 25, 10, 167, 53, 2, 27, 111, 876, 882, 1423, 1, 708, 112, 2687, 2, 63, 25, 118, 11, 456, 2, 243, 106, 23, 331, 65, 1110, 5668, 19, 13, 588, 2, 1547, 1883, 19, 13, 2376, 11, 41, 5, 231, 854, 182, 4, 7, 5, 387, 34, 146, 262, 49, 53, 1, 388, 36, 10, 41, 5, 405, 2687, 19, 13, 144, 186, 8366, 139, 385, 159, 672, 1751, 78, 245, 7213, 6935, 78, 39, 2, 1659, 4920, 4854, 78, 39, 2627, 1, 245, 7, 5, 1751, 616, 319, 337, 559, 3012, 319, 337, 25, 16, 899, 5, 397, 1396, 36, 141, 8366, 9, 131, 12, 626, 429, 16, 186, 1145, 8, 93, 207, 1, 7, 592, 293, 91, 4, 9018, 1, 571, 24, 4, 352, 6, 2415, 1, 34, 2, 24, 139, 787, 127, 130, 6, 40, 515, 198, 3675, 7, 9, 26, 353, 643, 3, 98, 268, 29, 388, 36, 6, 146, 2, 317, 3, 69, 16, 1665, 6, 560, 1547, 1883, 2, 1110, 5668, 4, 352, 6, 8366]",1990.0,23566444,206
Hematologic toxicity in RTOG 0418: a phase 2 study of postoperative IMRT for gynecologic cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2013-05-01,"Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), compared with conventional 4-field treatment, can reduce the volume of bone marrow irradiated. Pelvic bone marrow sparing has produced a clinically significant reduction in hematologic toxicity (HT). This analysis investigated HT in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0418, a prospective study to test the feasibility of delivering postoperative IMRT for cervical and endometrial cancer in a multiinstitutional setting. Patients in the RTOG 0418 study were treated with postoperative IMRT to 50.4 Gy to the pelvic lymphatics and vagina. Endometrial cancer patients received IMRT alone, whereas patients with cervical cancer received IMRT and weekly cisplatin (40 mg/m(2)). Pelvic bone marrow was defined within the treatment field by using a computed tomography density-based autocontouring algorithm. The volume of bone marrow receiving 10, 20, 30, and 40 Gy and the median dose to bone marrow were correlated with HT, graded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, criteria. Eighty-three patients were eligible for analysis (43 with endometrial cancer and 40 with cervical cancer). Patients with cervical cancer treated with weekly cisplatin and pelvic IMRT had grades 1-5 HT (23%, 33%, 25%, 0%, and 0% of patients, respectively). Among patients with cervical cancer, 83% received 5 or more cycles of cisplatin, and 90% received at least 4 cycles of cisplatin. The median percentage volume of bone marrow receiving 10, 20, 30, and 40 Gy in all 83 patients, respectively, was 96%, 84%, 61%, and 37%. Among cervical cancer patients with a V40 >37%, 75% had grade 2 or higher HT compared with 40% of patients with a V40 less than or equal to 37% (P =.025). Cervical cancer patients with a median bone marrow dose of >34.2 Gy also had higher rates of grade ≥ 2 HT than did those with a dose of ≤ 34.2 Gy (74% vs 43%, P=.049).

Brachytherapy followed (40 Gy). Toxicity was monitored by common terminology criteria for adverse events (version 3.0). The primary end point of response was assessed by 3-month posttherapy 2-[(18)F] fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography (PET/CT) and clinical examination. 3-AP radiochemotherapy achieved clinical responses in 24 (96% [95% confidence interval: 80-99%]) of 25 patients (median follow-up 20 months, range 2-35 months). 23 (96% [95% confidence interval: 80-99%]) of 24 patients had 3-month posttherapy PET/CT scans that recorded metabolic activity in the cervix or vagina equal or less than that of the cardiac blood pool, suggesting complete metabolic responses.

Differential cytotoxicity and particle action of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles in human cancer cells.,"Nanomedicine (London, England)",Nanomedicine (Lond),2013-04-24,"While hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HAPNs) have been reported to exhibit anticancer effects on several types of human cancer cells, no investigation has been performed to compare their cytotoxicity with different types of cancer cells. The objective of the present study is to investigate the cytotoxic action of HAPNs in different types of human cancer cell and to explore the possible mechanisms involved. Rod-shaped HAPNs were prepared by the aqueous precipitation method and then labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate to visualize the cellular uptake and distribution. Their cytotoxicity to three human carcinoma cell lines (gastric cancer cells [MGC80-3], cervical adenocarcinoma epithelial cells [HeLa] and hepatoma cells [HepG2], as well as to normal human hepatocyte cells [L-02]) was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Cell apoptosis was characterized by the changes in nuclear morphology with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining and by flow cytometric analysis with Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide double staining. Furthermore, the activity of apoptotic proteins (caspase-3, -8 and -9), intracellular reactive oxygen species and glutathione levels were analyzed in HAPN-treated cells. The cellular uptake of HAPNs was studied using flow cytometry analysis, and changes in intracellular calcium levels were investigated using the Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorescent dye, fluo-3 AM. HAPNs significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis of cancer cells with an order of MGC80-3 > HepG2 > HeLa, but had no impact on normal hepatic cells (L-02). The increase in apoptosis was accompanied by the activation of caspase-3 and -9, but not activation of caspase-8. Moreover, HAPN treatment led to reactive oxygen species generation and decreased intracellular glutathione in cancer cells, with the most remarkable reactive oxygen species burst in HeLa cells. The degree of cytotoxicity did not correlate with the cellular uptake efficiency of HAPNs. However, more HAPNs were found inside the nucleus of MGC80-3 cells, and an increase in the intracellular calcium level was observed in all cancer cells, with the highest level also detected in MGC80-3. Varying cytotoxicity of HAPNs was observed in different cancer cell types. Our results suggest that possible mechanisms of cytotoxicity in various types of cancer cells could be different. The elevated calcium concentration and nuclear localization of the particles might be the main mechanism of growth inhibition by HAPNs in cancer cells.",Comparative Study,2463.0,39.0,"While hydroxyapatite nanoparticles HAPNs have been reported to exhibit anticancer effects on several types of human cancer cells no investigation has been performed to compare their cytotoxicity with different types of cancer cells The objective of the present study is to investigate the cytotoxic action of HAPNs in different types of human cancer cell and to explore the possible mechanisms involved Rod-shaped HAPNs were prepared by the aqueous precipitation method and then labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate to visualize the cellular uptake and distribution Their cytotoxicity to three human carcinoma cell lines cancer cells MGC80-3 adenocarcinoma epithelial cells HeLa and hepatoma cells HepG2 as well as to normal human cells L-02 was assessed using the 3- 4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay Cell apoptosis was characterized by the changes in nuclear morphology with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining and by flow cytometric analysis with Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide double staining Furthermore the activity of apoptotic proteins caspase-3 -8 and -9 intracellular reactive oxygen species and glutathione levels were analyzed in HAPN-treated cells The cellular uptake of HAPNs was studied using flow cytometry analysis and changes in intracellular calcium levels were investigated using the Ca 2+ -sensitive fluorescent dye fluo-3 AM HAPNs significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis of cancer cells with an order of MGC80-3 HepG2 HeLa but had no impact on normal hepatic cells L-02 The increase in apoptosis was accompanied by the activation of caspase-3 and -9 but not activation of caspase-8 Moreover HAPN treatment led to reactive oxygen species generation and decreased intracellular glutathione in cancer cells with the most remarkable reactive oxygen species burst in HeLa cells The degree of cytotoxicity did not correlate with the cellular uptake efficiency of HAPNs However more HAPNs were found inside the nucleus of MGC80-3 cells and an increase in the intracellular calcium level was observed in all cancer cells with the highest level also detected in MGC80-3 Varying cytotoxicity of HAPNs was observed in different cancer cell types Our results suggest that possible mechanisms of cytotoxicity in various types of cancer cells could be different The elevated calcium concentration and nuclear localization of the particles might be the main mechanism of growth inhibition by HAPNs in cancer cells",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[369, 27279, 2889, 13725, 47, 85, 210, 6, 2239, 1475, 176, 23, 392, 630, 1, 171, 12, 37, 77, 940, 71, 85, 173, 6, 932, 136, 1408, 5, 338, 630, 1, 12, 37, 3, 461, 1, 3, 364, 45, 16, 6, 963, 3, 759, 1578, 1, 13725, 4, 338, 630, 1, 171, 12, 31, 2, 6, 1645, 3, 899, 483, 646, 14202, 8902, 13725, 11, 4421, 20, 3, 13152, 18912, 596, 2, 818, 2841, 5, 14425, 13790, 6, 9360, 3, 763, 1135, 2, 1395, 136, 1408, 6, 169, 171, 134, 31, 285, 12, 37, 29429, 27, 449, 701, 37, 8466, 2, 13822, 37, 8286, 22, 149, 22, 6, 295, 171, 37, 805, 588, 10, 275, 75, 3, 27, 39, 33, 12094, 18, 7983, 18, 33, 12525, 10168, 719, 31, 351, 10, 765, 20, 3, 400, 4, 928, 2567, 5, 14401, 49, 19425, 18, 19426, 1029, 2, 20, 1412, 6226, 65, 5, 4850, 603, 14425, 13790, 10839, 8456, 1627, 1029, 798, 3, 128, 1, 1631, 652, 1469, 27, 66, 2, 83, 2087, 2163, 2848, 2915, 2, 4571, 148, 11, 311, 4, 20006, 73, 37, 3, 763, 1135, 1, 13725, 10, 656, 75, 1412, 1914, 65, 2, 400, 4, 2087, 3299, 148, 11, 565, 75, 3, 1568, 18, 745, 2910, 3796, 62727, 27, 5886, 13725, 97, 879, 31, 457, 2, 277, 351, 1, 12, 37, 5, 35, 1732, 1, 29429, 27, 8286, 8466, 84, 42, 77, 345, 23, 295, 939, 37, 805, 588, 3, 344, 4, 351, 10, 2756, 20, 3, 363, 1, 1469, 27, 2, 83, 84, 44, 363, 1, 1469, 66, 1393, 20006, 24, 836, 6, 2163, 2848, 2915, 914, 2, 340, 2087, 4571, 4, 12, 37, 5, 3, 96, 3813, 2163, 2848, 2915, 18192, 4, 8466, 37, 3, 1444, 1, 1408, 205, 44, 1513, 5, 3, 763, 1135, 2904, 1, 13725, 137, 80, 13725, 11, 204, 8133, 3, 4262, 1, 29429, 27, 37, 2, 35, 344, 4, 3, 2087, 3299, 301, 10, 164, 4, 62, 12, 37, 5, 3, 1076, 301, 120, 530, 4, 29429, 27, 2990, 1408, 1, 13725, 10, 164, 4, 338, 12, 31, 630, 114, 99, 309, 17, 899, 483, 1, 1408, 4, 747, 630, 1, 12, 37, 359, 40, 338, 3, 804, 3299, 1227, 2, 928, 2145, 1, 3, 6095, 822, 40, 3, 1895, 670, 1, 129, 297, 20, 13725, 4, 12, 37]",2504.0,23614636,345
Strategies for relapsed peripheral T-cell lymphoma: the tail that wags the curve.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2013-04-29,"A 69-year-old woman was referred for further evaluation and management of relapsed angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. At diagnosis, she received six cycles of dose-adjusted EPOCH (etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin) and achieved a complete response (CR). Her first surveillance computed tomography scan 3 months later demonstrated enlarging cervical lymphadenopathy. A lymph node excision confirmed relapsed angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma with atypical lymphocytes expressing CD3, CD4, CD10, PD-1, and EBER, with loss of CD5 (Fig 1). A clonal T-cell receptor beta and gamma rearrangement by polymerase chain reaction was identical to that in her initial diagnostic biopsy. At our initial consultation, options for standard as well as investigational therapies were discussed, and HLA typing was initiated. The patient was enrolled onto an investigational phase II study; however, she developed progressive disease after two cycles. She was then treated with romidepsin 14 mg/m(2) administered intravenously for 3 consecutive weeks with 1 week off. After two cycles, she achieved a partial response, and after four additional cycles, she maintained her response without further improvement.

Galectin-7 levels predict radiation response in squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2013-04-30,"We previously found that galectin-7 was upregulated in patients with cervical cancer who remained recurrence-free after chemoradiation. We hypothesized that pretreatment levels of galectin-7 predict radiation response in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervix. Galectin-7 expression was assessed by immunohistochemical staining of a tissue microarray of paraffin-embedded specimens from 161 patients with cervical SCC treated with definitive radiation therapy in 1980-1999. Galectin-7 expression was scored as absent or present. Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and overall survival (OS) were computed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests. The median age at diagnosis was 45 years (range 21-85) and median follow-up interval was 71 months (range 0-285). Of the 161 patients, 105 (65%) had FIGO stage IB disease, 18 (11%) stage IIA, and 38 (24%) stage IIB. Median tumor diameter was 5.5 cm (range 3.5-8). Seven patients (4%) received concurrent chemotherapy; 139 patients (86%) had galectin-7-positive tumors and 22 (14%) galectin-7-negative tumors. Five-year DMFS rates for patients with galectin-7-positive versus -negative tumors were 73% and 55% (p=0.05); DSS, 65% and 36% (p=0.004); and OS, 64% and 36% (p=0.005). In multivariate analysis adjusting for age, stage, and tumor diameter, galectin-7 expression remained a significant predictor of DMFS (hazard ratio [HR]=0.43, p=0.03), DSS (HR=0.34, p=0.001), and OS (HR=0.34, p=0.001). Elevated galectin-7 expression is associated with improved outcomes after radiation therapy for cervical cancer. Further studies are required to validate these findings and clarify the role of galectin-7 in disease progression and radiation response.",Journal Article,2457.0,19.0,We previously found that galectin-7 was upregulated in patients with cancer who remained recurrence-free after chemoradiation We hypothesized that pretreatment levels of galectin-7 predict radiation response in patients with squamous cell carcinoma SCC of the cervix Galectin-7 expression was assessed by immunohistochemical staining of a tissue microarray of paraffin-embedded specimens from 161 patients with SCC treated with definitive radiation therapy in 1980-1999 Galectin-7 expression was scored as absent or present Distant metastasis-free survival DMFS disease-specific survival DSS and overall survival OS were computed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests The median age at diagnosis was 45 years range 21-85 and median follow-up interval was 71 months range 0-285 Of the 161 patients 105 65 had FIGO stage IB disease 18 11 stage IIA and 38 24 stage IIB Median tumor diameter was 5.5 cm range 3.5-8 Seven patients 4 received concurrent chemotherapy 139 patients 86 had galectin-7-positive tumors and 22 14 galectin-7-negative tumors Five-year DMFS rates for patients with galectin-7-positive versus -negative tumors were 73 and 55 p=0.05 DSS 65 and 36 p=0.004 and OS 64 and 36 p=0.005 In multivariate analysis adjusting for age stage and tumor diameter galectin-7 expression remained a significant predictor of DMFS hazard ratio HR =0.43 p=0.03 DSS HR=0.34 p=0.001 and OS HR=0.34 p=0.001 Elevated galectin-7 expression is associated with improved outcomes after radiation therapy for cancer Further studies are required to validate these findings and clarify the role of galectin-7 in disease progression and radiation response,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[21, 373, 204, 17, 8063, 67, 10, 2684, 4, 7, 5, 12, 54, 958, 146, 115, 50, 975, 21, 1237, 17, 1194, 148, 1, 8063, 67, 678, 121, 51, 4, 7, 5, 691, 31, 134, 1791, 1, 3, 3629, 8063, 67, 55, 10, 275, 20, 1382, 1029, 1, 8, 246, 1727, 1, 2487, 2505, 623, 29, 5377, 7, 5, 1791, 73, 5, 1057, 121, 36, 4, 4376, 2043, 8063, 67, 55, 10, 3179, 22, 3269, 15, 364, 626, 278, 115, 25, 5930, 34, 112, 25, 1788, 2, 63, 25, 118, 11, 1220, 75, 3, 876, 882, 596, 2, 1066, 1026, 895, 3, 52, 89, 28, 147, 10, 512, 60, 184, 239, 772, 2, 52, 166, 126, 268, 10, 792, 53, 184, 13, 8121, 1, 3, 5377, 7, 3263, 556, 42, 3837, 82, 3180, 34, 203, 175, 82, 4088, 2, 519, 259, 82, 3884, 52, 30, 2549, 10, 33, 33, 494, 184, 27, 33, 66, 648, 7, 39, 103, 750, 56, 4929, 7, 868, 42, 8063, 67, 109, 57, 2, 350, 213, 8063, 67, 199, 57, 365, 111, 5930, 151, 9, 7, 5, 8063, 67, 109, 185, 199, 57, 11, 803, 2, 614, 19, 13, 474, 1788, 556, 2, 511, 19, 13, 1520, 2, 118, 660, 2, 511, 19, 13, 1614, 4, 331, 65, 1358, 9, 89, 82, 2, 30, 2549, 8063, 67, 55, 958, 8, 93, 980, 1, 5930, 360, 197, 168, 13, 601, 19, 13, 680, 1788, 168, 13, 562, 19, 13, 144, 2, 118, 168, 13, 562, 19, 13, 144, 804, 8063, 67, 55, 16, 41, 5, 231, 123, 50, 121, 36, 9, 12, 195, 94, 32, 616, 6, 2183, 46, 272, 2, 3968, 3, 200, 1, 8063, 67, 4, 34, 91, 2, 121, 51]",1650.0,23643871,225
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act: impact on the care of gynecologic oncology patients in the absence of Medicaid expansion in central Virginia.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2013-05-03,"Many gynecologic oncology (GO) patients in Virginia are low income and their care is supplemented by Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) funds. Our objective is to estimate how many new GO patients may lose access to care if the state forgoes Medicaid expansion. New patients referred to the GO service between July 1, 2010 and July 1, 2012 were identified. Data were collected regarding age, race, referral diagnosis, payor, and state pay scale. Pay scale 1 (PS1) is equal to the federal poverty level (FPL). Assumptions included the following: (1) pay scale is a surrogate for income, (2) PS1 patients will be ineligible for discounted insurance through the exchanges, and (3) decreasing DSH funds will result in a reduction of the free-care pool. There were 1623 referrals to the GO service and the majority (83%) was Caucasian. The payor distribution was 44% commercial insurance, 5.6% Medicaid, 31% Medicare, and 10.4% uninsured. Among the 361 women who were PS1, 32% were uninsured. Thirty percent of PS1 patients were minorities and 47.4% had a malignancy. Of note, 52% of new patients with cervical cancer were PS1.

Pathologic ultrastaging improves micrometastasis detection in sentinel lymph nodes during endometrial cancer staging.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2013-06-01,"To describe the incidence of low-volume ultrastage-detected metastases in sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) identified at surgical staging for endometrial carcinoma and to correlate it with depth of myoinvasion and tumor grade. We reviewed all patients who underwent primary surgery for endometrial carcinoma with successful mapping of at least one SLN at our institution from September 2005 to December 2011. All patients underwent a cervical injection for mapping. The SLN ultrastaging protocol involved cutting an additional 2 adjacent 5-μm sections at each of 2 levels, 50-μm apart, from each paraffin block lacking metastatic carcinoma on routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. At each level, one slide was stained with H&E and with immunohistochemistry (IHC) using anticytokeratin AE1:AE3.Micrometastases (tumor deposits >0.2 mm and ≤2 mm) and isolated tumor cells (≤0.2 mm) were classified as low-volume ultrastage-detected metastases if pathologic ultrastaging was the only method allowing detection of such nodal disease. Of 508 patients with successful mapping, 413 patients (81.3%) had endometrioid carcinoma. Sixty-four (12.6%) of the 508 patients had positive nodes: routine H&E detected 35 patients (6.9%), ultrastaging detected an additional 23 patients (4.5%) who would have otherwise been missed (4 micrometastases and 19 isolated tumor cells), and 6 patients (1.2%) had metastatic disease in their non-SLNs. The incidence rates of low-volume ultrastage-detected nodal metastases in patients with grades 1, 2, and 3 tumors were 3.8%, 3.4%, and 6.9%, respectively. The frequency rates of low-volume ultrastage-detected metastases in patients with a depth of myoinvasion of 0, less than 50%, and 50% or more were 0.8%, 8.0%, and 7.4%, respectively. Lymphovascular invasion was present in 20 (87%) of the cases containing low-volume ultrastage-detected metastases in the lymph nodes. Sentinel lymph node mapping with pathologic ultrastaging in endometrial carcinoma detects additional low-volume metastases (4.5%) that would otherwise go undetected with routine evaluations. Our data support the incorporation of pathologic ultrastaging of SLNs in endometrial carcinoma with any degree of myoinvasion.

Prognosis of differentiated thyroid cancer in relation to serum thyrotropin and thyroglobulin antibody status at time of diagnosis.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2013-09-04,"Serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration and thyroid autoimmunity may be of prognostic importance in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Preoperative serum TSH level has been associated with higher DTC stage in cross-sectional studies; data are contradictory on the significance of thyroid autoimmunity at the time of diagnosis. We sought to assess whether preoperative serum TSH and perioperative antithyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) were associated with thyroid cancer stage and outcome in DTC patients followed by the National Thyroid Cancer Treatment Cooperative Study, a large multicenter thyroid cancer registry. Patients registered after 1996 with available preoperative serum TSH (n=617; the TSH cohort) or perioperative TgAb status (n=1770; the TgAb cohort) were analyzed for tumor stage, persistent disease, recurrence, and overall survival (OS; median follow-up, 5.5 years). Parametric tests assessed log-transformed TSH, and categorical variables were tested with chi square. Disease-free survival (DFS) and OS was assessed with Cox models. Geometric mean serum TSH levels were higher in patients with higher-stage disease (Stage III/IV=1.48 vs. 1.02 mU/L for Stages I/II; p=0.006). The relationship persisted in those aged ≥45 years after adjusting for sex (p=0.01). Gross extrathyroidal extension (p=0.03) and presence of cervical lymph node metastases (p=0.003) were also significantly associated with higher serum TSH. Disease recurrence and all-cause mortality occurred in 37 and 38 TSH cohort patients respectively, which limited the power for survival analysis. Positive TgAb was associated with lower stage on univariate analysis (positive TgAb in 23.4% vs. 17.8% of Stage I/II vs. III/IV patients, respectively; p=0.01), although the relationship lost significance when adjusting for age and sex (p=0.34).

J. Gynecol. Cancer,2013-07-01,"To evaluate the impact of distance from residence to treatment center on disease characteristics and recurrence of cervical cancer. A single-institution retrospective chart review of patients treated for cervical cancer during 2006-2011 was performed. Demographic, socioeconomic, and clinicopathologic characteristics were recorded. Distance traveled from home to treatment facility was calculated and categorized. Recurrence and follow-up data were extracted; progression-free survival and overall survival were calculated. SAS version 9.2 was used for statistical analysis. Two hundred nineteen patients met the study criteria; 75% were Caucasian. Forty-nine percent used tobacco. Twenty-five percent had stage III/IV disease. Insurance type was 46% private, 25% Medicaid, 20% Medicare, and 9% uninsured. Distance between residence and hospital was less than 15 miles (29%), 15 to 30 miles (21%), 30 to 50 miles (17%), and more than 50 miles (33%). Median follow-up period was 23 months (range, 1-65). Caucasians were more likely to travel more than 30 miles to a treatment center (P = 0.018) Non-Caucasians were less likely to have private insurance (P = 0.0005) and more likely to recur (P = 0.0045). Recurrence was highest (50%) in African Americans. Travel of more than 30 miles was not associated with age, stage, histology, tobacco abuse, employment, clinical trial enrollment, primary chemoradiation for stage IB disease, or delayed radiation. Travel of more than 30 miles was associated with government insurance (P = 0.029) and a trend toward unemployment (P = 0.059). Four-year progression-free survival (53% vs 52%; P = 0.992) and overall survival (57% vs 62%; P = 0.73) were similar between less than or more than 30-mile travel. Fifty percent of the patients reside more than 30 miles from treating hospital.

Human papillomavirus knowledge and awareness among Vietnamese mothers.,Journal of community health,J Community Health,2013-12-01,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the US and the primary cause of cervical cancer. Vietnamese American women have the highest incidence rates of cervical cancer but one of the lowest HPV vaccination rates. Parental knowledge is an important predictor of HPV vaccination; however, little is known about HPV knowledge in the Vietnamese American community. We aimed to describe the HPV knowledge of Vietnamese mothers in Houston, Texas and their intention to vaccinate their daughters. We conducted face-to-face interviews with Vietnamese mothers who had daughters aged 9-26 years. We collected data on demographics, acculturation, HPV knowledge, and vaccination intention. Knowledge scores (0-5) were calculated using 5 knowledge questions. We used logistic regression to identify predictors of HPV knowledge. Participants had low levels of acculturation by report of reading (31%) and writing (23%) English well. Less than 50% of participants (n = 47) had heard of HPV, and among these, the mean HPV knowledge score was 4. Although only 1 in 3 had discussed HPV with their medical provider, nearly 86% of participants who had not heard of HPV would vaccinate their daughter if their doctor had recommended it. Good written English skills and belief that the HPV vaccine was not expensive were predictors of HPV awareness. HPV awareness is low among less acculturated Vietnamese mothers in Houston.

Stage IB1 cervical cancer: role of preoperative MR imaging in selection of patients for fertility-sparing radical trachelectomy.,Radiology,Radiology,2013-06-20,"To determine whether magnetic resonance (MR) imaging evaluation of key morphologic tumor characteristics can improve patient selection for radical trachelectomy. The institutional review board approved and waived informed consent for this study of 62 patients (mean age, 32 years; age range, 23-42 years) with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IB1 cervical carcinoma who underwent attempted radical trachelectomy between November 2001 and January 2011 and had preoperative MR imaging. Retrospectively, two radiologists reviewed MR images for tumor presence and size, distance between tumor and internal os, and presence of deep cervical stromal invasion. Associations between MR imaging findings and surgery type were tested. Sensitivity and specificity of tumor detection were, respectively, 87% and 100% (reader 1) and 76% and 95% (reader 2). Six of six patients with negative cone biopsy margins and no tumor at postconization MR imaging were without tumor at trachelectomy pathologic analysis. Mean differences between MR imaging and histologic tumor sizes were 0.7 mm (range, -15 to 11 mm) for reader 1 and 2.2 mm (range, -9 to 15 mm) for reader 2. Sensitivities for deep cervical stromal invasion were 75% (reader 1) and 50% (reader 2).

Minimally invasive esophagectomy is safe in patients with previous gastric bypass.,Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,Surg Obes Relat Dis,2013-04-22,"The prevalence of morbid obesity in the United States has been steadily increasing, and there is an established relationship between obesity and the risk of developing certain cancers. Patients who have undergone prior gastric bypass (GB) and present with newly diagnosed esophageal cancer represent a new and challenging cohort for surgical resection of their disease. We present our case series of consecutive patients with previous GB who underwent minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE). Retrospective review of consecutive patients with a history of GB who underwent a MIE for esophageal cancer between July 2010 and August 2012. Five patients were identified with a mean age of 57 years. Mean follow-up was 9.1 months. Four patients had undergone laparoscopic GB, and 1 patient had an open GB. Two patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy for locally advanced disease. Minimally invasive procedures were thoracoscopic/laparoscopic esophagectomy with cervical anastomosis in 4 patients and colonic interposition in 1 patient. Mean operative time was 6 hours and 52 minutes. Median length of stay was 7 days. There was no mortality. Postoperative complications occurred in 3 patients and included pneumonia/respiratory failure, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and pyloric stenosis. All patients are alive and disease free at last follow-up. Minimally invasive esophagectomy after prior GB is well tolerated, is technically feasible, and has acceptable oncologic and perioperative outcomes.

Postoperative external beam radiation therapy and concurrent cisplatin followed by carboplatin/paclitaxel for stage III (FIGO 2009) endometrial cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2013-06-22,"The optimal adjuvant therapy in advanced endometrial cancer is controversial.

This study reports an institutional experience using this approach in stage III (FIGO 2009) endometrial cancer. Patients with stage III (FIGO 2009) endometrial cancer who underwent total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at a single institution from 01/2004 to 12/2009 were identified retrospectively. Those treated with adjuvant RT/cisplatin, followed by carboplatin/paclitaxel comprised the study population. Of the 40 eligible patients, 7 (18%) were stage IIIA and 33 (82%) IIIC. Nineteen patients (48%) were ≥ 60 years of age. Twenty-three (58%) had ≥ 50% myometrial invasion, 30 (75%) lymphovascular invasion, 11 (28%) cervical stromal invasion, and 5 (12%) positive peritoneal cytology. Histology was endometrioid in 32 (80%), serous in 6 (15%), and clear cell in 2 (5%). At a median follow-up of 49 months, the 5-year freedom from relapse was 79% and overall survival 85%.

Evaluation of a multiplex panel of immune-related markers in cervical secretions: a methodologic study.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2013-07-30,"Although persistent carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is necessary for cervical carcinogenesis, the cofactors involved in HPV persistence and disease progression are poorly understood. Chronic cervical inflammation may increase risk, but few studies have measured immune markers (cytokines, chemokines and soluble receptors) in cervical secretions. We evaluated the performance of 74 multiplexed, bead-based immune markers in cervical secretions from three groups of women with biopsy evaluation of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), (i) <CIN1, HPV-negative (n = 24), (ii) <CIN1, carcinogenic HPV-positive (n = 24) and (iii) CIN2/3, carcinogenic HPV-positive (n = 48), matched on time since last period and smoking status. We considered markers with >25% detectability and >80% interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) acceptable for epidemiologic studies. Within-batch coefficients of variation (CVs) of ≥25% indicated room for assay improvement. Secondarily, we explored associations between marker levels and CIN/HPV status adjusted for matching variables, assay batch, age and number of sexual partners. Sixty-two markers (84%) had >25% detectability and ICCs > 80%. Of those, 53 (85%) had CVs < 25%. Using these preliminary data, we found that HPV positivity was associated with increased eotaxin-1 [odds ratio (OR): 15.63, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.26-200.00] and G-CSF (OR: 12.99, 95% CI: 1.10-142.86) among CIN-negative women.

Commissioning of a grid-based Boltzmann solver for cervical cancer brachytherapy treatment planning with shielded colpostats.,Brachytherapy,Brachytherapy,2013-07-24,"We sought to commission a gynecologic shielded colpostat analytic model provided from a treatment planning system (TPS) library. We have reported retrospectively the dosimetric impact of this applicator model in a cohort of patients. A commercial TPS with a grid-based Boltzmann solver (GBBS) was commissioned for (192)Ir high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy for cervical cancer with stainless steel-shielded colpostats. Verification of the colpostat analytic model was verified using a radiograph and vendor schematics. MCNPX v2.6 Monte Carlo simulations were performed to compare dose distributions around the applicator in water with the TPS GBBS dose predictions. Retrospectively, the dosimetric impact was assessed over 24 cervical cancer patients' HDR plans. Applicator (TPS ID #AL13122005) shield dimensions were within 0.4 mm of the independent shield dimensions verification. GBBS profiles in planes bisecting the cap around the applicator agreed with Monte Carlo simulations within 2% at most locations; differing screw representations resulted in differences of up to 9%. For the retrospective study, the GBBS doses differed from TG-43 as follows (mean value ± standard deviation [min, max]): International Commission on Radiation units [ICRU]rectum (-8.4 ± 2.5% [-14.1, -4.1%]), ICRUbladder (-7.2 ± 3.6% [-15.7, -2.1%]), D2cc-rectum (-6.2 ± 2.6% [-11.9, -0.8%]), D2cc-sigmoid (-5.6 ± 2.6% [-9.3, -2.0%]), and D2cc-bladder (-3.4 ± 1.9% [-7.2, -1.1%]). As brachytherapy TPSs implement advanced model-based dose calculations, the analytic applicator models stored in TPSs should be independently validated before clinical use.

Paget Cells in Endometrial and Endocervical Curettings in a Patient With Recurrent Vulvar Paget's Disease.,International journal of surgical pathology,Int. J. Surg. Pathol.,2013-08-05,"Paget's disease of the vulva is a rare malignancy primarily affecting Caucasian women in their seventh to eighth decades. Most patients experience an indolent disease course and undergo surgical excision for disease control. Although progression to invasive adenocarcinoma is rare, recurrence is common because of the difficulty of achieving negative surgical margins. We report a case of a 73-year-old woman with a long-standing history of recurrent vulvar Paget's disease who presented with postmenopausal bleeding. Workup revealed extensive endocervical involvement by Paget's disease, resulting in Paget cells on endocervical curettage, as well as endometrial curettage (because of cervical contamination). Extensive endocervical involvement by vulvar Paget's disease can occur despite multiple reexcisions and topical therapy. The presence of Paget cells on endometrial and endocervical curettings, particularly in patients without visible vulvar or cervical lesions, should raise suspicion of endocervical involvement and prompt further evaluation of disease extension.",Case Reports,2360.0,1.0,Paget 's disease of the vulva is a rare malignancy primarily affecting Caucasian women in their seventh to eighth decades Most patients experience an indolent disease course and undergo surgical excision for disease control Although progression to invasive adenocarcinoma is rare recurrence is common because of the difficulty of achieving negative surgical margins We report a case of a 73-year-old woman with a long-standing history of recurrent Paget 's disease who presented with postmenopausal bleeding Workup revealed extensive endocervical involvement by Paget 's disease resulting in Paget cells on endocervical curettage as well as curettage because of contamination Extensive endocervical involvement by Paget 's disease can occur despite multiple reexcisions and topical therapy The presence of Paget cells on and endocervical curettings particularly in patients without visible or lesions should raise suspicion of endocervical involvement and prompt further evaluation of disease extension,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[7497, 292, 34, 1, 3, 9263, 16, 8, 622, 710, 1561, 2319, 3229, 117, 4, 136, 8114, 6, 7732, 1968, 96, 7, 730, 35, 2316, 34, 906, 2, 1251, 221, 1366, 9, 34, 182, 242, 91, 6, 416, 449, 16, 622, 146, 16, 186, 408, 1, 3, 4035, 1, 1785, 199, 221, 1012, 21, 414, 8, 473, 1, 8, 803, 111, 1095, 2854, 5, 8, 319, 10909, 532, 1, 387, 7497, 292, 34, 54, 917, 5, 1679, 2294, 4755, 553, 1344, 10174, 799, 20, 7497, 292, 34, 1113, 4, 7497, 37, 23, 10174, 12529, 22, 149, 22, 12529, 408, 1, 9866, 1344, 10174, 799, 20, 7497, 292, 34, 122, 1271, 550, 232, 34594, 2, 5879, 36, 3, 463, 1, 7497, 37, 23, 2, 10174, 63187, 823, 4, 7, 187, 4822, 15, 406, 257, 5008, 5782, 1, 10174, 799, 2, 4776, 195, 451, 1, 34, 2401]",1002.0,23918905,3
Risk factors for non-initiation of the human papillomavirus vaccine among adolescent survivors of childhood cancer.,"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",Cancer Prev Res (Phila),2013-08-27,"Effective vaccination is now available to prevent human papillomavirus (HPV), the most common sexually transmitted infection and cause of cervical cancer. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of HPV vaccination among childhood cancer survivors and identify factors associated with HPV vaccine initiation and completion. Mothers of daughters of ages 9 to 17 years with/without a history of childhood cancer (n = 235, Mage = 13.2 years, SD = 2.69; n = 70, Mage = 13.3 years, SD = 2.47, respectively) completed surveys querying HPV vaccination initiation and completion along with sociodemographic, medical, HPV knowledge and communication, and health belief factors, which may relate to vaccination outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors that associate with HPV vaccination initiation and completion. Among cancer survivors, 32.6% initiated and 17.9% completed the three-dose vaccine series, whereas 34.3% and 20.0% of controls initiated and completed, respectively.

Oncogenic mutations in cervical cancer: genomic differences between adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix.,Cancer,Cancer,2013-08-23,"Cervical cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women worldwide. The objective of this study was to describe the most common oncogenic mutations in cervical cancers and to explore genomic differences between the 2 most common histologic subtypes: adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. A high-throughput genotyping platform, termed Oncomap, was used to interrogate 80 cervical tumors for 1250 known mutations in 139 cancer genes. Samples were analyzed using a mass spectrometry-based genotyping platform and were validated using orthogonal chemistry. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations were further validated by massive parallel sequencing. Human papilloma virus (HPV) genotyping also was performed. Validated mutations were detected in 48 of 80 tumors (60%) examined. The highest mutation rates were in the genes phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, catalytic subunit α (PIK3CA) (31.3%); Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) (8.8%); and EGFR (3.8%). PIK3CA mutation rates did not differ significantly between adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas (25% vs 37.5%, respectively; P = .33). In contrast, KRAS mutations were identified only in adenocarcinomas (17.5% vs 0%; P = .01), and a novel EGFR mutation was detected only in squamous cell carcinomas (0% vs 7.5%; P = .24). There were no associations between HPV-16 or HPV-18 and somatic mutations or overall survival. In adjusted analyses, PIK3CA mutations were associated with shorter survival (67.1 months vs 90.3 months; hazard ratio, 9.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.8-29.5 months; P < .001). Cervical cancers harbor high rates of potentially targetable oncogenic mutations.

Comparative morbidity and mortality from cervical or thoracic esophageal anastomoses.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2013-09-21,"In the modern era of esophagectomy, we hypothesized that perioperative morbidity and mortality from cervical or thoracic sites of anastomoses would not be different. We used the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database to identify patients who underwent esophagectomy for lower esophageal or gastroesophageal (GE) junction malignancies from 2005 to 2010. Patients were categorized as having either a cervical or thoracic anastomosis based on CPT codes. There were 601 (66%) cervical and 308 (34%) thoracic anastomoses. Cervical anastomoses were associated with greater than 2 units of blood transfusion in a higher proportion of patients (10% vs. 3%, P = 0.001), and higher superficial surgical site infections (13% vs. 7%, P = 0.003). There were no difference in rates of organ/space infections (6% vs. 7%, P = 0.70), overall morbidity (38% vs. 39%, P = 0.84), or mortality (3% vs. 4%, P = 0.34).

"The Sequencing Bead Array (SBA), a next-generation digital suspension array.",PloS one,PLoS ONE,2013-10-07,"Here we describe the novel Sequencing Bead Array (SBA), a complete assay for molecular diagnostics and typing applications. SBA is a digital suspension array using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), to replace conventional optical readout platforms. The technology allows for reducing the number of instruments required in a laboratory setting, where the same NGS instrument could be employed from whole-genome and targeted sequencing to SBA broad-range biomarker detection and genotyping. As proof-of-concept, a model assay was designed that could distinguish ten Human Papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes associated with cervical cancer progression. SBA was used to genotype 20 cervical tumor samples and, when compared with amplicon pyrosequencing, was able to detect two additional co-infections due to increased sensitivity. We also introduce in-house software Sphix, enabling easy accessibility and interpretation of results. The technology offers a multi-parallel, rapid, robust, and scalable system that is readily adaptable for a multitude of microarray diagnostic and typing applications, e.g. genetic signatures, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), structural variations, and immunoassays.

PET with 62Cu-ATSM and 62Cu-PTSM is a useful imaging tool for hypoxia and perfusion in pulmonary lesions.,AJR. American journal of roentgenology,AJR Am J Roentgenol,2013-11-01,"Hypoxia is a characteristic of many tumors and portends a worse prognosis in lung, cervical, prostate, and rectal cancers. Unlike the others, lung cancers present a unique challenge in measuring hypoxia, with invasive biopsies and higher rates of complications. Noninvasive imaging studies detecting hypoxia using isotopes of copper-diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) ((62)Cu-ATSM) have predicted prognosis and treatment outcomes in some small feasibility trials. These images, however, may not identify all areas of hypoxia. Hence, we hypothesize that the addition of another PET imaging agent, copper-pyruvaldehyde-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) ((62)Cu-PTSM), which can detect areas of perfusion, can augment the information obtained in (62)Cu-ATSM PET scans. To characterize tumors on the basis of both perfusion and hypoxia, 10 patients were studied using both (62)Cu-ATSM and (62)Cu-PTSM PET scans. In addition, proteomic arrays looking at specific proangiogenic, survival, and proinflammatory targets were assessed. Six of 10 patients had evaluable PET scans. Our initial experience of characterizing lung tumor hypoxia using (62)Cu-ATSM and (62)Cu-PTSM PET scans showed that visualization of areas with hypoxia normalized for perfusion is feasible. All studied tumors exhibited some hypoxia. Despite the small sample size, a positive relationship was noted between epidermal growth factor levels and (62)Cu-ATSM-detected hypoxia. This initial series of (62)Cu-ATSM and (62)Cu-PTSM PET scans shows that evaluating lung masses by visualizing hypoxia and perfusion is a feasible and novel technique to provide more information. Further investigation is warranted to assess the potential role of (62)Cu-ATSM and (62)Cu-PTSM PET techniques combined with proteomics as alternatives to invasive biopsy techniques in clinical care.",Journal Article,2272.0,12.0,Hypoxia is a characteristic of many tumors and portends a worse prognosis in and cancers Unlike the others cancers present a unique challenge in measuring hypoxia with invasive biopsies and higher rates of complications Noninvasive imaging studies detecting hypoxia using isotopes of copper-diacetyl-bis N4-methylthiosemicarbazone 62 Cu-ATSM have predicted prognosis and treatment outcomes in some small feasibility trials These images however may not identify all areas of hypoxia Hence we hypothesize that the addition of another PET imaging agent copper-pyruvaldehyde-bis N4-methylthiosemicarbazone 62 Cu-PTSM which can detect areas of perfusion can augment the information obtained in 62 Cu-ATSM PET scans To characterize tumors on the basis of both perfusion and hypoxia 10 patients were studied using both 62 Cu-ATSM and 62 Cu-PTSM PET scans In addition proteomic arrays looking at specific proangiogenic survival and proinflammatory targets were assessed Six of 10 patients had evaluable PET scans Our initial experience of characterizing tumor hypoxia using 62 Cu-ATSM and 62 Cu-PTSM PET scans showed that visualization of areas with hypoxia normalized for perfusion is feasible All studied tumors exhibited some hypoxia Despite the small sample size a positive relationship was noted between epidermal growth factor levels and 62 Cu-ATSM-detected hypoxia This initial series of 62 Cu-ATSM and 62 Cu-PTSM PET scans shows that evaluating masses by visualizing hypoxia and perfusion is a feasible and novel technique to provide more information Further investigation is warranted to assess the potential role of 62 Cu-ATSM and 62 Cu-PTSM PET techniques combined with proteomics as alternatives to invasive biopsy techniques in clinical care,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,"[1823, 16, 8, 2037, 1, 445, 57, 2, 8745, 8, 639, 356, 4, 2, 163, 4246, 3, 1749, 163, 364, 8, 991, 1745, 4, 2978, 1823, 5, 416, 1154, 2, 142, 151, 1, 521, 2957, 270, 94, 2502, 1823, 75, 16210, 1, 10289, 48014, 7200, 33541, 40518, 744, 6119, 22818, 47, 783, 356, 2, 24, 123, 4, 476, 302, 1437, 143, 46, 1572, 137, 68, 44, 255, 62, 1361, 1, 1823, 3665, 21, 4919, 17, 3, 352, 1, 1809, 495, 270, 420, 10289, 63543, 7200, 33541, 40518, 744, 6119, 32198, 92, 122, 1426, 1361, 1, 3018, 122, 4369, 3, 487, 683, 4, 744, 6119, 22818, 495, 1441, 6, 1507, 57, 23, 3, 877, 1, 110, 3018, 2, 1823, 79, 7, 11, 656, 75, 110, 744, 6119, 22818, 2, 744, 6119, 32198, 495, 1441, 4, 352, 3784, 3923, 9095, 28, 112, 8571, 25, 2, 5767, 637, 11, 275, 437, 1, 79, 7, 42, 859, 495, 1441, 114, 388, 730, 1, 5723, 30, 1823, 75, 744, 6119, 22818, 2, 744, 6119, 32198, 495, 1441, 224, 17, 6234, 1, 1361, 5, 1823, 4207, 9, 3018, 16, 1313, 62, 656, 57, 1416, 476, 1823, 550, 3, 302, 1000, 444, 8, 109, 858, 10, 1051, 59, 829, 129, 161, 148, 2, 744, 6119, 22818, 530, 1823, 26, 388, 988, 1, 744, 6119, 22818, 2, 744, 6119, 32198, 495, 1441, 1949, 17, 1435, 2692, 20, 21396, 1823, 2, 3018, 16, 8, 1313, 2, 229, 1312, 6, 377, 80, 487, 195, 940, 16, 1197, 6, 423, 3, 174, 200, 1, 744, 6119, 22818, 2, 744, 6119, 32198, 495, 1092, 397, 5, 6478, 22, 6295, 6, 416, 411, 1092, 4, 38, 165]",1746.0,24147499,315
Costs and outcomes evaluation of patient navigation after abnormal cancer screening: evidence from the Patient Navigation Research Program.,Cancer,Cancer,2013-10-25,"Navigators can facilitate timely access to cancer services, but to the authors' knowledge there are little data available regarding their economic impact. The authors conducted a cost-consequence analysis of navigation versus usual care among 10,521 individuals with abnormal breast, cervical, colorectal, or prostate cancer screening results who enrolled in the Patient Navigation Research Program study from January 1, 2006 to March 31, 2010. Navigation costs included diagnostic evaluation, patient and staff time, materials, and overhead. Consequences or outcomes were time to diagnostic resolution and probability of resolution. Differences in costs and outcomes were evaluated using multilevel, mixed-effects regression modeling adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, language, marital status, insurance status, cancer, and site clustering. The majority of individuals were members of a minority (70.7%) and uninsured or publically insured (72.7%). Diagnostic resolution was higher for navigation versus usual care at 180 days (56.2% vs 53.8%; P = .008) and 270 days (70.0% vs 68.2%; P < .001). Although there were no differences in the average number of days to resolution between the 2 groups (110 days vs 109 days; P = .63), the probability of ever having diagnostic resolution was higher for the navigation group versus the usual-care group (84.5% vs 79.6%; P < .001). The added cost of navigation versus usual care was $275 per patient (95% confidence interval, $260-$290; P < .001).

Variable impact of intracavitary brachytherapy fractionation schedule on biologically effective dose to organs at risk in patients with cervical cancer.,Brachytherapy,Brachytherapy,2013-11-01,"To determine the effect of intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) fractionation schedule on biologically effective dose to organs at risk. We reviewed records from 26 patients who had CT imaging during ICBT for International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IB2-IVA cervical cancer. Using α/β=10, we calculated hypothetical nominal doses to achieve a biologically effective dose at 2 Gy per fraction (EQD2α/β=10) of 40 Gy to Point A for high-dose-rate ICBT with 1-15 fractions. Corresponding minimum EQD2α/β=3s to the maximally irradiated 2 cc of rectum, bladder, and sigmoid were calculated for each fractionation scheme and added to EQD2α/β=3 from external beam radiotherapy. Total EQD2α/β=3s were compared with American Brachytherapy Society suggested dose constraints (rectum/sigmoid, ≤75 Gy; bladder, ≤90 Gy). Except for rectal EQD2α/β=3 in three patients, the rectal, bladder, and sigmoid EQD2α/β=3s decreased with increasing fractionation in all patients. Although the total rectal EQD2α/β=3s were less than the American Brachytherapy Society rectal dose constraint in all patients at all fractionation schedules, the total bladder EQD2α/β=3s routinely exceeded the bladder dose constraint, even at maximum fractionation. By contrast, increasing fractionation decreased the number of patients with doses exceeding the sigmoid dose constraint by 48%. The relationship between ICBT fractionation schedule and relative EQD2α/β=3s to rectum, bladder, and sigmoid depends on individual anatomy. Fractionation optimization can improve therapeutic ratios by minimizing the risk or severity of toxic effects. For patients in whom many fractions optimize the therapeutic ratio, low-dose-rate or pulsed-dose-rate brachytherapy may be preferred.",Journal Article,2272.0,1.0,To determine the effect of intracavitary brachytherapy ICBT fractionation schedule on biologically effective dose to organs at risk We reviewed records from 26 patients who had CT imaging during ICBT for International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IB2-IVA cancer Using α/β=10 we calculated hypothetical nominal doses to achieve a biologically effective dose at 2 Gy per fraction EQD2α/β=10 of 40 Gy to Point A for high-dose-rate ICBT with 1-15 fractions Corresponding minimum EQD2α/β=3s to the maximally irradiated 2 cc of rectum and sigmoid were calculated for each fractionation scheme and added to EQD2α/β=3 from external beam radiotherapy Total EQD2α/β=3s were compared with American Brachytherapy Society suggested dose constraints rectum/sigmoid ≤75 Gy ≤90 Gy Except for EQD2α/β=3 in three patients the and sigmoid EQD2α/β=3s decreased with increasing fractionation in all patients Although the total EQD2α/β=3s were less than the American Brachytherapy Society dose constraint in all patients at all fractionation schedules the total EQD2α/β=3s routinely exceeded the dose constraint even at maximum fractionation By contrast increasing fractionation decreased the number of patients with doses exceeding the sigmoid dose constraint by 48 The relationship between ICBT fractionation schedule and relative EQD2α/β=3s to rectum and sigmoid depends on individual anatomy Fractionation optimization can improve therapeutic ratios by minimizing the risk or severity of toxic effects For patients in whom many fractions optimize the therapeutic ratio low-dose-rate or pulsed-dose-rate brachytherapy may be preferred,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,"[6, 223, 3, 254, 1, 9122, 1536, 23808, 3519, 1055, 23, 2665, 323, 61, 6, 2285, 28, 43, 21, 446, 1064, 29, 432, 7, 54, 42, 425, 270, 190, 23808, 9, 944, 7303, 1, 6429, 2, 7407, 82, 9537, 5900, 12, 75, 2014, 1458, 79, 21, 981, 7045, 8948, 415, 6, 1359, 8, 2665, 323, 61, 28, 18, 381, 379, 1509, 24088, 1458, 79, 1, 327, 381, 6, 741, 8, 9, 64, 61, 116, 23808, 5, 14, 167, 1550, 1734, 2499, 24088, 1458, 19813, 6, 3, 6402, 2398, 18, 1951, 1, 3660, 2, 9356, 11, 981, 9, 296, 3519, 4633, 2, 1953, 6, 24088, 1458, 27, 29, 1455, 1345, 310, 181, 24088, 1458, 19813, 11, 72, 5, 597, 1536, 1174, 1148, 61, 4879, 3660, 9356, 40469, 381, 25286, 381, 2187, 9, 24088, 1458, 27, 4, 169, 7, 3, 2, 9356, 24088, 1458, 19813, 340, 5, 602, 3519, 4, 62, 7, 242, 3, 181, 24088, 1458, 19813, 11, 299, 76, 3, 597, 1536, 1174, 61, 11482, 4, 62, 7, 28, 62, 3519, 2314, 3, 181, 24088, 1458, 19813, 3066, 4726, 3, 61, 11482, 871, 28, 689, 3519, 20, 748, 602, 3519, 340, 3, 207, 1, 7, 5, 415, 5178, 3, 9356, 61, 11482, 20, 576, 3, 858, 59, 23808, 3519, 1055, 2, 580, 24088, 1458, 19813, 6, 3660, 2, 9356, 3828, 23, 797, 5081, 3519, 3980, 122, 401, 189, 1137, 20, 4501, 3, 43, 15, 1702, 1, 1812, 176, 9, 7, 4, 953, 445, 1550, 2465, 3, 189, 197, 154, 61, 116, 15, 5695, 61, 116, 1536, 68, 40, 2514]",1632.0,24188993,799

Women in the young group predominately had a diagnosis of cervical cancer (82.8%) while women in the senior group primarily had a diagnosis of vulvar or vaginal cancer (70.7%). Senior women were also more likely to have hypertension (p < 0.0001) and pulmonary disease (p = 0.040). Operative time was significantly shorter for women in the senior group (8.5h) compared with the middle (9.5h) and young group (10.1h) (p = 0.0089). There were no significant differences in early or late complications when stratified by age. The overall survival did not differ between age groups (p = 0.3760).

Impact of facility volume on therapy and survival for locally advanced cervical cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2013-12-12,"Chemosensitizing radiation with brachytherapy is standard of care for treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer, an increasingly rare disease. Treatment facility volume has been correlated with outcome in many diseases. Treatment outcome and likelihood of receiving standard therapy in locally advanced cervical cancer based on facility volume were examined using a large national cancer database. The National Cancer Data Base was queried for patients with stage IIB - IIIB cervical cancer from 1/1998 through 12/2010. Facility volumes were tallied. Overall survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to determine variables affecting survival, receiving standard therapy, and total duration of radiotherapy. We identified a total of 27,660 patients who were treated at 1361 facilities. Thirty of the facilities (2.2%) treated the highest quartile volume of patients (>9.4 patients annually) while 1072 facilities (78.8%) treated <2.4 patients annually. The median age of patients was 53, the majority were Caucasian, treated in a metropolitan area, and of squamous cell histology. Median survival of patients treated at lowest- and highest-volume centers were 42.3 months (95% CI 39.8-44.8) and 53.8 months (50.1-57.5), respectively (p < 0.001). The proportions of patients receiving brachytherapy and chemotherapy were 54.8% and 79.9%, respectively. On multivariable analysis, higher facility volume independently predicted improved survival (p = 0.022), increased likelihood of receiving brachytherapy (p < 0.0005) and chemotherapy (p = 0.013), and shorter time to radiotherapy completion (p < 0.0005).

Cervical conization and sentinel lymph node mapping in the treatment of stage I cervical cancer: is less enough?,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2014-01-01,"This study aimed to determine the feasibility of cervical conization and sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping as a fertility-sparing strategy to treat stage I cervical cancer and to estimate the tumor margin status needed to achieve no residual carcinoma in the cervix. We identified all patients who desired fertility preservation and underwent SLN mapping with cervical conization for stage I cervical cancer from September 2005 to August 2012. Relevant demographic, clinical, and pathologic information was collected. Ten patients were identified. Median age was 28 years (range, 18-36 years). None of the patients had a grossly visible tumor. The initial diagnosis of invasive carcinoma was made either on a loop electrosurgical excision procedure or cone biopsy. All patients underwent preoperative radiologic evaluation (magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography-computed tomography). None of the patients had evidence of gross tumor or suspicion of lymph node metastasis on imaging. Stage distribution included 7 (70%) patients with stage IA1 cervical cancer with lymphovascular invasion and 3 (30%) patients with microscopic IB1. Histologic diagnosis included 8 (80%) patients with squamous cell carcinoma, 1 (10%) patient with adenocarcinoma, and 1 (10%) patient with clear cell carcinoma. Nine patients underwent repeat cervical conization with SLN mapping, and 1 patient underwent postconization cervical biopsies and SLN mapping. None of the patients had residual tumor identified on the final specimen. The median distance from the invasive carcinoma to the endocervical margin was 2.25 mm, and the distance from the invasive carcinoma to the ectocervical margin was 1.9 mm. All collected lymph nodes were negative for metastasis. After a median follow-up of 17 months (range, 1-83 months), none of the patients' conditions were diagnosed with recurrent disease and 3 (30%) patients achieved pregnancy. Cervical conization and SLN mapping seems to be an acceptable treatment strategy for selected patients with small-volume stage I cervical cancer.

Socioeconomic factors and the risk for sarcoma.,European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP),Eur. J. Cancer Prev.,2014-11-01,"Sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of rare malignancies arising from mesenchymal tissue. Although several occupational exposures have been evaluated in association with sarcoma, little is known about the role of socioeconomic indicators such as education. Socioeconomic status has been found to be associated with risk of development of several types of cancers, primarily lung, gastric, and cervical cancers. We conducted a hospital-based case-control study to evaluate the association of socioeconomic level with the risk for sarcoma. A total of 371 incident cases of sarcoma were matched in terms of age, sex, and year of enrollment in the study with 742 cancer-free controls. Education and income levels were evaluated as the indicators of socioeconomic status. Higher education (college level) was associated with a significantly lower risk for sarcoma [odds ratio (OR)=0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.29-0.80], even after adjusting for important confounders. After stratifying by sex, significantly lower risk for sarcoma was observed among men who had college level education compared with men with a level of education of eighth grade or lower (OR=0.38, 95% CI=0.19-0.74). A significant association between education and the risk for sarcoma remained after stratifying by income (OR=0.49, 95% CI=0.28-0.86, among the low income group). When analyzed as a composite exposure, individuals with high education and high income status had significantly lower risk for sarcoma compared with those with low income and low education status (OR=0.41, 95% CI=0.23-0.71).

Virol.,2014-01-03,"The etiological role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical cancer has been well established. However, it is inconclusive whether HPV plays the same role in esophageal carcinogenesis. In this study, we detected HPV infection in 145 frozen esophageal tissues, including 30 normal epithelium (ENOR), 37 dysplasia (DYS) and 78 invasive squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and in 143 frozen cervical tissues composed of 30 normal epithelium (CNOR), 38 intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and 75 invasive squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). The patients and symptom-free subjects enrolled in this study were from a high-incidence area for both ESCC and CSCC, Linzhou City, Northern China, from 2007 to 2009. The HPV infection analysis was conducted by using an HPV GenoArray Test Kit. We found that the high-risk HPV types accounted for more than 90 % of the HPV-positive lesions of esophagus and cervix tissues. The prevalence of high-risk HPV types increased significantly during the progression of both esophageal and cervical carcinogenesis (positive rate in esophageal tissues: 33 % ENOR, 70 % in DYS and 69 % in ESCC; positive rate in cervical tissues: 27 % in CNOR, 82 % in CIN and 88 % in CSCC; P < 0.001, respectively). Infection with the high-risk HPV types increased the risk for both DYS and ESCC by 4-fold (DYS vs. ENOR: OR = 4.73, 95 %CI = 1.68-13.32; ESCC vs. ENOR: OR = 4.50, 95 %CI = 1.83-11.05) and increased the risk for both CIN and CSCC by 12-fold and 20-fold (CIN vs. CNOR: OR = 12.18, 95 %CI = 3.85-38.55; CSCC vs. CNOR: OR = 20.17, 95 %CI = 6.93-58.65), respectively. The prevalence of high-risk types in ESCC patients was lower than that in CSCC patients (P = 0.005) and was significantly associated with the degree of ESCC tumor infiltration (P = 0.001). HPV 16 was the most prevalent subtype in both esophageal and cervical tissues. Single HPV infection increased significantly along with the progression of ESCC and maintained a high level in cervical tissues, regardless of whether they were CNOR or CSCC tissues.

Landscape of genomic alterations in cervical carcinomas.,Nature,Nature,2013-12-25,"Cervical cancer is responsible for 10-15% of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide. The aetiological role of infection with high-risk human papilloma viruses (HPVs) in cervical carcinomas is well established. Previous studies have also implicated somatic mutations in PIK3CA, PTEN, TP53, STK11 and KRAS as well as several copy-number alterations in the pathogenesis of cervical carcinomas. Here we report whole-exome sequencing analysis of 115 cervical carcinoma-normal paired samples, transcriptome sequencing of 79 cases and whole-genome sequencing of 14 tumour-normal pairs. Previously unknown somatic mutations in 79 primary squamous cell carcinomas include recurrent E322K substitutions in the MAPK1 gene (8%), inactivating mutations in the HLA-B gene (9%), and mutations in EP300 (16%), FBXW7 (15%), NFE2L2 (4%), TP53 (5%) and ERBB2 (6%). We also observe somatic ELF3 (13%) and CBFB (8%) mutations in 24 adenocarcinomas. Squamous cell carcinomas have higher frequencies of somatic nucleotide substitutions occurring at cytosines preceded by thymines (Tp*C sites) than adenocarcinomas.

We searched the electronic databases PubMed and the Cochrane Library. We included studies demonstrating quantifiable differences by race and ethnicity in the incidence, treatment, and survival of gynecologic cancers in the United States (US). Most studies relied on retrospective data. We focused on differences between Black and White women, because of the limited number of studies on non-Black women. White women have a higher incidence of ovarian cancer compared to Black women. However, the all-cause ovarian cancer mortality in Black women is 1.3 times higher than that of White women. Endometrial and cervical cancer mortality in Black women is twice that of White women. The etiology of these disparities is multifaceted. However, much of the evidence suggests that equal care leads to equal outcomes for Black women diagnosed with gynecologic cancers. Underlying molecular factors may play an additional role in aggressive tumor biology and endometrial cancer disparities. Gynecologic cancer disparities exist between Black and White women.

J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2014-01-07,"To assess practice patterns and compliance with clinical performance measures for radiation therapy (RT) for patients with intact carcinoma of the cervix. Trained research associates reviewed the records of 261 randomly selected patients who received RT for cervix carcinoma between 2005 and 2007 from 45 facilities randomly selected after stratification by practice type. National estimates of patient and treatment characteristics were calculated from survey data using SUDAAN statistical software. From the survey data, we estimated that only 8% of US facilities treated on average more than 3 eligible patients per year. No small or medium nonacademic facilities in the survey treated more than 3 eligible patients per year. Approximately 65.5% of patients began treatment in a facility that treated 3 or fewer eligible patients per year. Although 87.5% of patients had brachytherapy as part of their treatment, the proportion treated with external beam RT only was about double that estimated from the 1996 to 1999 survey. The use of high-dose-rate brachytherapy sharply increased, particularly in small nonacademic facilities. Overall, patients treated in nonacademic facilities were more likely to have incomplete or protracted treatment; 43% of patients treated in small nonacademic facilities did not have treatment completed within 10 weeks. Also, patients treated in facilities that treated 3 or fewer eligible patients per year were significantly less likely to receive concurrent chemotherapy than were patients treated in other facilities.

Simultaneous characterization of somatic events and HPV-18 integration in a metastatic cervical carcinoma patient using DNA and RNA sequencing.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2014-02-01,"Integration of carcinogenic human papillomaviruses (HPVs) into the host genome is a significant tumorigenic factor in specific cancers including cervical carcinoma. Although major strides have been made with respect to HPV diagnosis and prevention, identification and development of efficacious treatments for cervical cancer patients remains a goal and thus requires additional detailed characterization of both somatic events and HPV integration. Given this need, the goal of this study was to use the next generation sequencing to simultaneously evaluate somatic alterations and expression changes in a patient's cervical squamous carcinoma lesion metastatic to the lung and to detect and analyze HPV infection in the same sample. We performed tumor and normal exome, tumor and normal shallow whole-genome sequencing, and RNA sequencing of the patient's lung metastasis. We generated over 1.2 billion mapped reads and identified 130 somatic point mutations and indels, 21 genic translocations, 16 coding regions demonstrating copy number changes, and over 36 genes demonstrating altered expression in the tumor (corrected P < 0.05). Sequencing also revealed the HPV type 18 (HPV-18) integration in the metastasis. Using both DNA and RNA reads, we pinpointed 3 major events indicating HPV-18 integration into an intronic region of chromosome 6p25.1 in the patient's tumor and validated these events with Sanger sequencing. This integration site has not been reported for HPV-18. We demonstrate that DNA and RNA sequencing can be used to concurrently characterize somatic alterations and expression changes in a biopsy and delineate HPV integration at base resolution in cervical cancer.

Trap-door (n=13) and clamshell (n=4) thoracotomies were performed for neuroblastoma (n=9), non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma (n=4), germ cell tumor (n=2), rhabdomyosarcoma (n=1), and neuroendocrine small cell carcinoma (n=1). Fourteen of these cervicothoracic tumors were primary, and three were metastatic. Gross total resection was achieved in 15 patients (94%). Operative complications included vocal cord paralysis (n=2), mild upper-extremity neuropraxia (n=2), and hemidiaphragm paralysis (n=1), All but one involved encased nerves. Overall survival was 61% for the series and 80% for patients with primary tumors. Eleven (73%) of 15 patients who underwent gross total resection had no evidence of recurrence. Three patients with metastatic disease died of distant progression within 1.3years.

Lifestyle modification in cervical cancer survivors: an ongoing need.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2014-03-01,"With the introduction of multimodality therapy for cervical cancer, many women will be long-term survivors in need of comprehensive surveillance care. Our goals were to evaluate patterns of obesity and smoking in a cohort of cervical cancer survivors and to assess the potential influence of these comorbidities on subsequent follow-up. We reviewed the records of patients treated for invasive cervical cancer at our institution from 2000 to 2003 who had no evidence of disease for 3 or more years. Demographic and clinical data were collected, including smoking history and anthropometric measurements. Body mass index (BMI) was categorized according to World Health Organization criteria. Logistic regression and Wilcoxon rank sum analyses were performed. Two hundred ninety-eight women had complete follow-up data at 3 years. The median age at diagnosis was 43.5 years (range, 17.6-87.1 years). At diagnosis, 31.9% had a normal BMI, 28.2% were overweight, and 34.6% were obese compared with 31.7%, 21.1%, and 30.2% at 3 years, respectively. Of the 51 women whose BMI categorization changed, 33 (64.7%) had weight gain, and 18 (35.3%) had weight loss. By paired analyses, increase in BMI was significant over the 3-year interval (P < 0.001). Seventy patients actively smoked at diagnosis. Compared with nonsmokers, current smokers had a greater odds of referral to the pain service (odds ratio [OR], 6.56; confidence interval [CI], 6.26-16.43; P < 0.001), physical therapy (OR, 4.74; CI, 1.29-17.36; P = 0.02), and gastroenterology (OR, 2.25; CI, 1.14-4.24; P = 0.02).

Incidental detection of late subsequent intracranial neoplasms with magnetic resonance imaging among adult survivors of childhood cancer.,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,J Cancer Surviv,2014-02-02,"Survivors of childhood cancer are at an increased risk of developing subsequent neoplasms. In long-term survivors of childhood malignancies treated with and without cranial radiation therapy (CRT), undergoing unenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, we estimated detection of intracranial neoplasms. To investigate neurocognitive outcomes, 219 survivors of childhood cancer underwent unenhanced screening MRI of the brain. Of the survivors, 164 had been treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (125 received CRT) and 55 for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) (none received CRT). MRI examinations were reviewed and systematically coded by a single neuroradiologist. Demographic and treatment characteristics were compared for survivors with and without subsequent neoplasms. Nineteen of the 219 survivors (8.7 %) had a total of 31 subsequent intracranial neoplasms identified by neuroimaging at a median time of 25 years (range 12-46 years) from diagnosis. All neoplasms occurred after CRT, except for a single vestibular schwannoma within the cervical radiation field in a HL survivor. The prevalence of subsequent neoplasms after CRT exposure was 14.4 % (18 of 125). By noncontrast MRI, intracranial neoplasms were most suggestive of meningiomas. Most patients presented with no specific, localizing neurological complaints. In addition to the schwannoma, six tumors were resected based on results of MRI screening, all of which were meningiomas on histologic review. Unenhanced brain MRI of long-term survivors of childhood cancer detected a substantial number of intracranial neoplasms. Screening for early detection of intracranial neoplasms among aging survivors of childhood cancer who received CRT should be evaluated. The high prevalence of incidentally detected subsequent intracranial neoplasms after CRT in long-term survivors of childhood cancer and the minimal symptoms reported by those with intracranial tumors in our study indicate that brain MRI screening of long-term survivors who received CRT may be warranted.

HPV-associated lung cancers: an international pooled analysis.,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,2014-02-12,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the etiologic risk factor for cervical cancer. Some studies have suggested an association with a subset of lung tumors, but the etiologic link has not been firmly established. We performed an international pooled analysis of cross-sectional studies (27 datasets, n = 3249 patients) to evaluate HPV DNA prevalence in lung cancer and to investigate viral presence according to clinical and demographic characteristics. HPV16/18 were the most commonly detected, but with substantial variation in viral prevalence between geographic regions. The highest prevalence of HPV16/18 was observed in South and Central America, followed by Asia, North America and Europe (adjusted prevalence rates = 22, 5, 4 and 3%, respectively). Higher HPV16 prevalence was noted in each geographic region compared with HPV18, except in North America. HPV16/18-positive lung cancer was less likely observed among White race (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.12-0.90), whereas no associations were observed with gender, smoking history, age, histology or stage. Comparisons between tumor and normal lung tissue show that HPV was more likely to be present in lung cancer rather than normal lung tissues (OR = 3.86, 95% CI = 2.87-5.19). Among a subset of patients with HPV16-positive tumors, integration was primarily among female patients (93%, 13/14), while the physical status in male cases (N = 14) was inconsistent. Our findings confirm that HPV DNA is present in a small fraction of lung tumors, with large geographic variations. Further comprehensive analysis is needed to assess whether this association reflects a causal relationship.",Journal Article,2169.0,38.0,Human papillomavirus HPV is the etiologic risk factor for cancer Some studies have suggested an association with a subset of tumors but the etiologic link has not been firmly established We performed an international pooled analysis of cross-sectional studies 27 datasets n 3249 patients to evaluate HPV DNA prevalence in cancer and to investigate viral presence according to clinical and demographic characteristics HPV16/18 were the most commonly detected but with substantial variation in viral prevalence between geographic regions The highest prevalence of HPV16/18 was observed in South and Central America followed by Asia North America and Europe adjusted prevalence rates 22 5 4 and 3 respectively Higher HPV16 prevalence was noted in each geographic region compared with HPV18 except in North America HPV16/18-positive cancer was less likely observed among White race adjusted odds ratio OR 0.33 95 confidence interval CI 0.12-0.90 whereas no associations were observed with gender smoking history age histology or stage Comparisons between tumor and normal tissue show that HPV was more likely to be present in cancer rather than normal tissues OR 3.86 95 CI 2.87-5.19 Among a subset of patients with HPV16-positive tumors integration was primarily among female patients 93 13/14 while the physical status in male cases N 14 was inconsistent Our findings confirm that HPV DNA is present in a small fraction of tumors with large geographic variations Further comprehensive analysis is needed to assess whether this association reflects a causal relationship,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[171, 3242, 933, 16, 3, 6604, 43, 161, 9, 12, 476, 94, 47, 1148, 35, 248, 5, 8, 697, 1, 57, 84, 3, 6604, 3460, 71, 44, 85, 12971, 635, 21, 173, 35, 944, 1830, 65, 1, 1383, 2832, 94, 428, 3455, 78, 40615, 7, 6, 376, 933, 261, 1078, 4, 12, 2, 6, 963, 1667, 463, 768, 6, 38, 2, 1540, 374, 4048, 203, 11, 3, 96, 841, 530, 84, 5, 1281, 1380, 4, 1667, 1078, 59, 3466, 1374, 3, 1076, 1078, 1, 4048, 203, 10, 164, 4, 5452, 2, 854, 4010, 370, 20, 5958, 2669, 4010, 2, 3934, 586, 1078, 151, 350, 33, 39, 2, 27, 106, 142, 4048, 1078, 10, 1051, 4, 296, 3466, 1053, 72, 5, 33514, 2187, 4, 2669, 4010, 4048, 203, 109, 12, 10, 299, 322, 164, 107, 886, 1047, 586, 610, 197, 15, 13, 466, 48, 307, 268, 58, 13, 133, 13, 424, 547, 77, 685, 11, 164, 5, 1632, 979, 532, 89, 784, 15, 82, 2213, 59, 30, 2, 295, 246, 514, 17, 933, 10, 80, 322, 6, 40, 364, 4, 12, 1832, 76, 295, 742, 15, 27, 868, 48, 58, 18, 912, 33, 326, 107, 8, 697, 1, 7, 5, 4048, 109, 57, 2676, 10, 1561, 107, 1061, 7, 966, 233, 213, 369, 3, 900, 156, 4, 1045, 140, 78, 213, 10, 4923, 114, 272, 1843, 17, 933, 261, 16, 364, 4, 8, 302, 1509, 1, 57, 5, 375, 3466, 2293, 195, 949, 65, 16, 575, 6, 423, 317, 26, 248, 5224, 8, 5163, 858]",1567.0,24523449,268
Improved survival with bevacizumab in advanced cervical cancer.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2014-02-01,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes angiogenesis, a mediator of disease progression in cervical cancer. Bevacizumab, a humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, has single-agent activity in previously treated, recurrent disease. Most patients in whom recurrent cervical cancer develops have previously received cisplatin with radiation therapy, which reduces the effectiveness of cisplatin at the time of recurrence. We evaluated the effectiveness of bevacizumab and nonplatinum combination chemotherapy in patients with recurrent, persistent, or metastatic cervical cancer. Using a 2-by-2 factorial design, we randomly assigned 452 patients to chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab at a dose of 15 mg per kilogram of body weight. Chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin at a dose of 50 mg per square meter of body-surface area, plus paclitaxel at a dose of 135 or 175 mg per square meter or topotecan at a dose of 0.75 mg per square meter on days 1 to 3, plus paclitaxel at a dose of 175 mg per square meter on day 1. Cycles were repeated every 21 days until disease progression, the development of unacceptable toxic effects, or a complete response was documented. The primary end point was overall survival; a reduction of 30% in the hazard ratio for death was considered clinically important. Groups were well balanced with respect to age, histologic findings, performance status, previous use or nonuse of a radiosensitizing platinum agent, and disease status. Topotecan-paclitaxel was not superior to cisplatin-paclitaxel (hazard ratio for death, 1.20). With the data for the two chemotherapy regimens combined, the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy was associated with increased overall survival (17.0 months vs. 13.3 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.71; 98% confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.95; P=0.004 in a one-sided test) and higher response rates (48% vs. 36%, P=0.008). Bevacizumab, as compared with chemotherapy alone, was associated with an increased incidence of hypertension of grade 2 or higher (25% vs. 2%), thromboembolic events of grade 3 or higher (8% vs. 1%), and gastrointestinal fistulas of grade 3 or higher (3% vs. 0%). The addition of bevacizumab to combination chemotherapy in patients with recurrent, persistent, or metastatic cervical cancer was associated with an improvement of 3.7 months in median overall survival.

Detection of sentinel lymph nodes in minimally invasive surgery using indocyanine green and near-infrared fluorescence imaging for uterine and cervical malignancies.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2014-02-28,"Our primary objective was to assess the detection rate of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) using indocyanine green (ICG) and near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging for uterine and cervical malignancies.

Intracervical ICG was the fluorophobe in all cases. Four cc (1.25mg/mL) of ICG was injected into the cervix alone divided into the 3- and 9-o'clock positions, with 1 cc deep into the stroma and 1 cc submucosally before initiating laparoscopic entry. Blue dye was concurrently injected in some cases. Two hundred twenty-seven cases were performed. Median age was 60 years (range, 28-90 years). Median BMI was 30.2 kg/m(2) (range, 18-60 kg/m(2)). The median SLN count was 3 (range, 1-23). An SLN was identified in 216 cases (95%), with bilateral pelvic mapping in 179 (79%). An aortic SLN was identified in 21 (10%) of the 216 mapped cases. When ICG alone was used to map cases, 188/197 patients mapped, for a 95% detection rate compared to 93% (28/30) in cases in which both dyes were used (P=NS).

Human papillomavirus status of head and neck cancer as determined in cytologic specimens using the hybrid-capture 2 assay.,Oral oncology,Oral Oncol.,2014-03-12,"A standardized assay to determine the HPV status of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) specimens has not yet been established, particularly for cytologic samples. The goal of this study was to determine whether the hybrid capture-2 (HC-2) assay, already widely used for the detection of high risk HPV in cervical brushings, is applicable to cytologic specimens obtained from patients with suspected HNSCCs. Fine needle aspirates (FNA) of cervical lymph nodes were pre-operatively obtained from patients with suspected HNSCCs and evaluated for the presence of HPV using the HC-2 assay. HPV analysis was performed on the corresponding resected tissue specimens using p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and HR-HPV in situ hybridization (ISH). A cost analysis was performed using the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services. HPV status of the cervical lymph node metastases was correctly classified using the HC-2 assay in 84% (21/25) of cases.

Surgical site infection in women undergoing surgery for gynecologic cancer.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2014-05-01,"The objectives of this study were to describe the rate and predictors of surgical site infection (SSI) after gynecologic cancer surgery and identify any association between SSI and postoperative outcome. Patients with endometrial, cervical, or ovarian cancers from 2005 to 2011 were identified from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. The extent of surgical intervention was categorized into modified surgical complexity scoring (MSCS) system. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used. Odds ratios were adjusted for patient demographics, comorbidities, preoperative laboratory values, and operative factors. Of 6854 patients, 369 (5.4%) were diagnosed with SSI. Surgical site infection after laparotomy was 3.5 times higher compared with minimally invasive surgery (7% vs 2%; P < 0.001). Among laparotomy group, independent predictors of SSI included endometrial cancer diagnosis, obesity, ascites, preoperative anemia, American Society of Anesthesiologists class greater than or equal to 3, MSCS greater than or equal to 3, and perioperative blood transfusion. Among laparoscopic cases, independent predictors of SSI included only preoperative leukocytosis and overweight. For patients with deep or organ space SSI, significant predictors included hypoalbuminemia, preoperative weight loss, respiratory comorbidities, MSCS greater than 4, and perioperative blood transfusion for laparotomy and only preoperative leukocytosis for minimally invasive surgery. Surgical site infection was associated with longer mean hospital stay and higher rate of reoperation, sepsis, and wound dehiscence. Surgical site infection was not associated with increased risk of acute renal failure or 30-day mortality. These findings were consistent in subset of patients with deep or organ space SSI. Seven percent of patients undergoing laparotomy for gynecologic malignancy developed SSI. Surgical site infection is associated with longer hospital stay and more than 5-fold increased risk of reoperation. In this study, we identified several risk factors for developing SSI among gynecologic cancer patients. These findings may contribute toward identification of patients at risk for SSI and the development of strategies to reduce SSI rate and potentially reduce the cost of care in gynecologic cancer surgery.",Journal Article,2091.0,24.0,The objectives of this study were to describe the rate and predictors of surgical site infection SSI after gynecologic cancer surgery and identify any association between SSI and postoperative outcome Patients with or cancers from 2005 to 2011 were identified from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program The extent of surgical intervention was categorized into modified surgical complexity scoring MSCS system Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used Odds ratios were adjusted for patient demographics comorbidities preoperative laboratory values and operative factors Of 6854 patients 369 5.4 were diagnosed with SSI Surgical site infection after laparotomy was 3.5 times higher compared with minimally invasive surgery 7 vs 2 P 0.001 Among laparotomy group independent predictors of SSI included cancer diagnosis obesity ascites preoperative anemia American Society of Anesthesiologists class greater than or equal to 3 MSCS greater than or equal to 3 and perioperative blood transfusion Among laparoscopic cases independent predictors of SSI included only preoperative leukocytosis and overweight For patients with deep or organ space SSI significant predictors included hypoalbuminemia preoperative weight loss respiratory comorbidities MSCS greater than 4 and perioperative blood transfusion for laparotomy and only preoperative leukocytosis for minimally invasive surgery Surgical site infection was associated with longer mean hospital stay and higher rate of reoperation sepsis and wound dehiscence Surgical site infection was not associated with increased risk of acute failure or 30-day mortality These findings were consistent in subset of patients with deep or organ space SSI Seven percent of patients undergoing laparotomy for gynecologic malignancy developed SSI Surgical site infection is associated with longer hospital stay and more than 5-fold increased risk of reoperation In this study we identified several risk factors for developing SSI among gynecologic cancer patients These findings may contribute toward identification of patients at risk for SSI and the development of strategies to reduce SSI rate and potentially reduce the cost of care in gynecologic cancer surgery,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[3, 2409, 1, 26, 45, 11, 6, 897, 3, 116, 2, 674, 1, 221, 606, 930, 6837, 50, 1512, 12, 152, 2, 255, 500, 248, 59, 6837, 2, 573, 228, 7, 5, 15, 163, 29, 1242, 6, 1132, 11, 108, 29, 3, 597, 2979, 1, 1613, 657, 221, 372, 767, 1243, 3, 1039, 1, 221, 788, 10, 2320, 237, 1230, 221, 3082, 2504, 4460, 398, 880, 2, 331, 812, 320, 318, 11, 95, 610, 1137, 11, 586, 9, 69, 2221, 1909, 498, 1624, 1030, 2, 1208, 130, 1, 64135, 7, 8718, 33, 39, 11, 265, 5, 6837, 221, 606, 930, 50, 3274, 10, 27, 33, 1072, 142, 72, 5, 2144, 416, 152, 67, 105, 18, 19, 13, 144, 107, 3274, 87, 306, 674, 1, 6837, 159, 12, 147, 1661, 3819, 498, 1545, 597, 1174, 1, 9558, 1040, 378, 76, 15, 2997, 6, 27, 4460, 378, 76, 15, 2997, 6, 27, 2, 1547, 315, 2785, 107, 1964, 140, 306, 674, 1, 6837, 159, 158, 498, 7463, 2, 3566, 9, 7, 5, 2369, 15, 1259, 3865, 6837, 93, 674, 159, 11667, 498, 924, 407, 2718, 1909, 4460, 378, 76, 39, 2, 1547, 315, 2785, 9, 3274, 2, 158, 498, 7463, 9, 2144, 416, 152, 221, 606, 930, 10, 41, 5, 589, 313, 702, 2020, 2, 142, 116, 1, 5077, 4227, 2, 2689, 11811, 221, 606, 930, 10, 44, 41, 5, 101, 43, 1, 286, 496, 15, 201, 218, 282, 46, 272, 11, 925, 4, 697, 1, 7, 5, 2369, 15, 1259, 3865, 6837, 648, 714, 1, 7, 479, 3274, 9, 1512, 710, 276, 6837, 221, 606, 930, 16, 41, 5, 589, 702, 2020, 2, 80, 76, 33, 1116, 101, 43, 1, 5077, 4, 26, 45, 21, 108, 392, 43, 130, 9, 931, 6837, 107, 1512, 12, 7, 46, 272, 68, 1248, 1317, 911, 1, 7, 28, 43, 9, 6837, 2, 3, 193, 1, 422, 6, 969, 6837, 116, 2, 751, 969, 3, 835, 1, 165, 4, 1512, 12, 152]",2263.0,24681712,257
Clinical evaluation of the cartridge-based GeneXpert human papillomavirus assay in women referred for colposcopy.,Journal of clinical microbiology,J. Clin. Microbiol.,2014-04-09,"High-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing is now being introduced as a potential primary screening test for improved detection of cervical precancer and cancer. Current U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved tests are batch tests that take several hours to complete. A rapid, non-batch test might permit point-of-care (POC) testing, which can facilitate same-day screen and management strategies. For a non-batch, random-access platform (GeneXpert; Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA), a prototype hrHPV assay (Xpert) has been developed where testing for 14 hrHPV types can be completed in 1 h. In the first clinical evaluation, Xpert was compared to two validated hrHPV tests, the cobas HPV test (cobas, Roche Molecular Systems) and Hybrid Capture 2 (hc2, Qiagen), and to histologic outcomes using specimens from colposcopy referral populations at 7 clinical sites in the United States (n = 697). The sensitivity of Xpert for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or more severe diagnoses (CIN2+) (n = 141) was equal to that of cobas (90.8% versus 90.8%, P = 1) and greater than that of hc2 (90.8% versus 81.6%, P = 0.004). Xpert was more specific than cobas (42.6% versus 39.6%, P = 0.02) and less specific than hc2 (42.6% versus 47.7%, P < 0.001). Similar results were observed for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or higher (CIN3+) (n = 91). HPV16 detection by Xpert identified 41.8% of the CIN2+ specimens with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 54.6%. By comparison, HPV16 detection by cobas identified 42.6% of the CIN2+ specimens with a PPV of 55.0%. hrHPV detection by the Xpert demonstrated excellent clinical performance for identifying women with CIN2+ and CIN3+ that was comparable to that of currently available clinically validated tests.

Normalization of lymphocyte count after high ablative dose of I-131 in a patient with chronic lymphoid leukemia and secondary papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Case report.,"Einstein (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",Einstein (Sao Paulo),,"The authors report the case of a 70-year-old male patient with chronic lymphoid leukemia who presented subsequently a papillary carcinoma of the thyroid with metastases to regional lymph nodes. The patient was treated with surgical thyroidectomy with regional and cervical lymph node excision and radioiodine therapy (I-131). The protocolar control scintigraphy 4 days after the radioactive dose showed I-131 uptake in both axillae and even in the inguinal regions. PET/CT showed faint FDG-F-18 uptake in one lymph node of the left axilla. An ultrasound guided fine needle biopsy of this lymph node identified by I-131 SPECT/CT and FDG-F-18 PET/CT revealed lymphoma cells and was negative for thyroid tissue and thyroglobulin content. The sequential blood counts done routinely after radiation treatment showed a marked fall until return to normal values of leucocytes and lymphocytes (absolute and relative), which were still normal in the last control 19 months after the radioiodine administration. Chest computed tomography showed a decrease in size of axillary and para-aortic lymph nodes.

The role of postoperative radiation therapy for endometrial cancer: Executive summary of an American Society for Radiation Oncology evidence-based guideline.,Practical radiation oncology,Pract Radiat Oncol,2014-03-31,"To present evidence-based guidelines for adjuvant radiation in the treatment of endometrial cancer. Key clinical questions to be addressed in this evidence-based guideline on endometrial cancer were identified. A comprehensive literature review was performed to identify studies that included no adjuvant therapy, or pelvic radiation or vaginal brachytherapy with or without systemic chemotherapy. Outcomes included local control, survival rates, and overall assessment of quality of life. Patients with grade 1 or 2 cancers with either no invasion or <50% myometrial invasion (MI), especially when no other high risk features are present, can be safely observed after hysterectomy. Vaginal cuff brachytherapy is as effective as pelvic radiation therapy at preventing vaginal recurrence for patients with grade 1 or 2 cancers with ≥50% MI or grade 3 tumors with <50% MI. Patients with grade 3 cancer with ≥50% MI or cervical stroma invasion may benefit from pelvic radiation to reduce the risk of pelvic recurrence. There is limited evidence for a benefit to vaginal cuff brachytherapy following pelvic radiation.

Metastatic cervical carcinoma from an unknown primary: literature review.,"Ear, nose, & throat journal",Ear Nose Throat J,,"Carcinoma of an unknown primary (CUP) encompasses a heterogeneous group of tumors for which no primary site can be detected following a thorough history, physical examination, and noninvasive and invasive testing. CUP presenting with metastasis to the neck (metastatic cervical carcinoma from an unknown primary [MCCUP]) has been an enigma since von Volkmann first described it in 1882 as a cancer arising in a branchial cleft cyst. Genetic studies have shed some light on this unusual entity. In most cases, clinical features, imaging studies, and a meticulous assessment of the upper aerodigestive tract should assist in identifying the source of disease. Molecular testing of cytologic specimens for Epstein-Barr virus and human papillomavirus (HPV) can facilitate identification of the primary site in the nasopharynx and oropharynx. At least 25% of MCCUPs are directly attributable to HPV-related malignancies, and this number can be expected to increase.

We compared the age at cervical cancer diagnosis between PAYA cancer survivors and females in the general US population. We used longitudinal data from 9 population-based registries of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program collected between 1973 and 2010. PAYA cancer survivors were females diagnosed with any cancer before age 30 years, survived at least 5 years post-diagnosis, and were subsequently diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer (n=46). The general US population comprised females who were diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer as the primary malignancy (n=26,956). We estimated the difference in median age at diagnosis (ß₅₀) and bootstrap 95% confidence limits (CL) of invasive cervical cancer after adjustment for year of diagnosis and race. The median age at diagnosis of invasive cervical cancer was 33 years for female PAYA cancer survivors and 40 years for females in the general US population (ß50=-7.0, 95% CL: -11, -3.2). Similar differences were observed across subgroups of stage and histologic subtype of invasive cervical cancer. Our results suggest that PAYA cancer survivors are diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer at a substantially younger age compared with females without a prior cancer diagnosis in the general US population.

We conducted a pilot study among 72 women referred to colposcopy following abnormal screening. Participants provided a urine sample prior to clinician-collected cervical sampling and colposcopically-directed punch biopsy. Trovagene HPV test results on urine samples were compared with cervical and urine testing by Linear Array HPV Genotyping Test (LA-HPV) for detection of histologically-confirmed cervical precancerous lesions. There was high concordance between urine samples tested by the Trovagene HPV test and corresponding cervical (87.5%) and urine (81.9%) samples tested by LA-HPV.

Factors associated with reduced accuracy in Papanicolaou tests for patients with invasive cervical cancer.,Cancer cytopathology,Cancer Cytopathol,2014-05-28,"Recent proposals to lengthen the interval in cervical cancer screening highlight the importance of the accurate interpretation of screening tests. Tumor debris present in Papanicolaou (Pap) tests from women with invasive cancer is known to hamper interpretation.

A total of 3003 women with the spectrum of cervical lesions who had ThinPrep (Hologic Inc, Marlborough, Mass) Pap and human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping tests performed were grouped by their most severe histologic diagnosis. Cytologic and HPV results were analyzed by cross-sectional analysis. The unsatisfactory rate of cytology specimens from patients with cancer (3.1%) was significantly higher than those from patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of type 3 or less (0.8%) (P < .001). The percentage of samples with qualified adequacy was 34.8% in specimens from patients with cancer compared with only 3.6% from specimens from those without cancer (P < .001). The unsatisfactory and qualified adequacy rates were higher in squamous cancers compared with adenocarcinomas. However, adenocarcinomas were identified less frequently than squamous cancers (37.0% vs 61.7%) in the Pap tests. HPV tests were positive in 84.4% of unsatisfactory cases including 8 of 9 cancer cases, although 8.5% of cancers tested negative for HPV. Unsatisfactory and suboptimal ThinPrep Pap tests were increased in cancer cases compared with lesser histologic diagnoses. This was found to be particularly true for squamous cancers. Specimens from adenocarcinomas had fewer adequacy problems but were less frequently recognized as malignant.

The HSs rated as most favorable by VAS were also rated as most favorable by SG. Increasing age was associated with higher VAS scores for menopause and vaginal shortening (P = 0.04 and 0.036). African Americans had higher VAS scores for dietary changes (P = 0.05), sexual dysfunction (P = 0.028), and diarrhea (P = 0.05) when compared with Hispanic and non-Hispanic white patients. Women receiving radiation had more favorable VAS scores for menopause compared with women undergoing radical hysterectomy (P = 0.05). Women receiving chemotherapy rated urinary self-catheterization less favorably by VAS score compared with those not receiving chemotherapy (P = 0.045).

Impact of patient navigation on timely cancer care: the Patient Navigation Research Program.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2014-06-17,"Patient navigation is a promising intervention to address cancer disparities but requires a multisite controlled trial to assess its effectiveness. The Patient Navigation Research Program compared patient navigation with usual care on time to diagnosis or treatment for participants with breast, cervical, colorectal, or prostate screening abnormalities and/or cancers between 2007 and 2010. Patient navigators developed individualized strategies to address barriers to care, with the focus on preventing delays in care. To assess timeliness of diagnostic resolution, we conducted a meta-analysis of center- and cancer-specific adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) comparing patient navigation vs usual care. To assess initiation of cancer therapy, we calculated a single aHR, pooling data across all centers and cancer types. We conducted a metaregression to evaluate variability across centers. All statistical tests were two-sided. The 10521 participants with abnormal screening tests and 2105 with a cancer or precancer diagnosis were predominantly from racial/ethnic minority groups (73%) and publically insured (40%) or uninsured (31%). There was no benefit during the first 90 days of care, but a benefit of navigation was seen from 91 to 365 days for both diagnostic resolution (aHR = 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23 to 1.84; P < .001)) and treatment initiation (aHR = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.86; P < .007). Metaregression revealed that navigation had its greatest benefits within centers with the greatest delays in follow-up under usual care.

Fat composition changes in bone marrow during chemotherapy and radiation therapy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2014-07-08,"To quantify changes in bone marrow fat fraction and determine associations with peripheral blood cell counts. In this prospective study, 19 patients received either highly myelotoxic treatment (radiation therapy plus cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil mitomycin C [FU/MMC], or cisplatin/5-FU/cetuximab) or less myelotoxic treatment (capecitabine-radiation therapy or no concurrent chemotherapy). Patients underwent MR imaging and venipuncture at baseline, midtreatment, and posttreatment visits. We performed mixed effects modeling of the mean proton density fat fraction (PDFF[%]) by linear time, treatment, and vertebral column region (lumbar [L]4-sacral [S]2 vs thoracic [T]10-L3 vs cervical[C]3-T9), while controlling for cumulative mean dose and other confounders. Spearman rank correlations were performed by white blood cell (WBC) counts versus the differences in PDFF(%) before and after treatment. Cumulative mean dose was associated with a 0.43% per Gy (P=.004) increase in PDFF(%). In the highly myelotoxic group, we observed significant changes in PDFF(%) per visit within L4-S2 (10.1%, P<.001) and within T10-L3 (3.93%, P=.01), relative to the reference C3-T9. In the less myelotoxic group, we did not observe significant changes in PDFF(%) per visit according to region. Within L4-S2, we observed a significant difference between treatment groups in the change in PDFF(%) per visit (5.36%, P=.04). Rank correlations of the inverse log differences in WBC versus the differences in PDFF(%) overall and within T10-S2 ranged from 0.69 to 0.78 (P<.05). Rank correlations of the inverse log differences in absolute neutrophil counts versus the differences in PDFF(%) overall and within L4-S2 ranged from 0.79 to 0.81 (P<.05). Magnetic resonance imaging fat quantification is sensitive to marrow composition changes that result from chemoradiation therapy. These changes are associated with peripheral blood cell counts.

Optimization of MR imaging for pretreatment evaluation of patients with endometrial and cervical cancer.,"Radiographics : a review publication of the Radiological Society of North America, Inc",Radiographics,,"Endometrial and cervical cancer are the most common gynecologic malignancies in the world. Accurate staging of cervical and endometrial cancer is essential to determine the correct treatment approach. The current International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system does not include modern imaging modalities. However, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has proved to be the most accurate noninvasive modality for staging endometrial and cervical carcinomas and often helps with risk stratification and making treatment decisions. Multiparametric MR imaging is increasingly being used to evaluate the female pelvis, an approach that combines anatomic T2-weighted imaging with functional imaging (ie, dynamic contrast material-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging). MR imaging helps guide treatment decisions by depicting the depth of myometrial invasion and cervical stromal involvement in patients with endometrial cancer and tumor size and parametrial invasion in those with cervical cancer.

We conducted a single institution retrospective review of patients who had undergone a complete PE for locally recurrent gynecologic cancer. Demographic and clinicopathologic data were collected. 32 patients were identified (2000-2012); 21 (66%) cervical cancer, 8 (25%) vaginal, and 3 (9%) vulvar cancer. All patients were previously irradiated. Twenty-one (66%) received IORT. Mean age was 51. Eight patients had a LEER, all with IORT. Median PFS and OS, respectively, for those with PE alone was 33 and 41 vs. 10 and 10 months for PE+IORT compared to 9 and 17 months for LEER+IORT (P=.04).

New strategies in advanced cervical cancer: from angiogenesis blockade to immunotherapy.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2014-08-07,"Cervical cancer remains unique among solid tumor malignancies. Persistent infection with oncogenic subtypes of the human papillomavirus (HPV) results in carcinogenesis, predominantly occurring at the cervical transformation zone where endocervical columnar cells undergo metaplasia to a stratified squamous epithelium. The molecular cascade involving viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7 and their degradative interactions with cellular tumor suppressor gene products, p53 and pRb, respectively, has been precisely delineated. The precursor state of cervical neoplasia may last for years allowing for ready detection through successful screening programs in developed countries using cervical cytology and/or high-risk HPV DNA testing. Prophylactic HPV L1 capsid protein vaccines using virus-like-particle technology have been developed to prevent primary infection by the most common high-risk HPVs (16 and 18). Women who lack access to health care and those who undergo sporadic screening remain at risk. Although radical surgery (including fertility-sparing surgery) is available for patients with early-stage cancers, and chemoradiation plus high-dose-rate brachytherapy can cure the majority of those with locally advanced disease, patients with metastatic and nonoperable recurrent cervical cancer constitute a high-risk population with an unmet clinical need.

Same-day discharge is feasible and safe in patients undergoing minimally invasive staging for gynecologic malignancies.,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol.,2014-08-14,"The objective of the study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of same-day discharge of patients undergoing minimally invasive comprehensive surgical staging for endometrial and cervical cancer. We performed a retrospective review of consecutive patients from January 2008 to December 2011 undergoing comprehensive staging for endometrial or cervical cancer by traditional laparoscopy or robotic-assisted laparoscopy and intended for same-day discharge. Patients accomplishing same-day discharge were compared with those who required admission. Clinical and demographic data, perioperative outcomes, and postoperative patient contacts within 6 weeks were collected. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to determine factors associated with admission and unscheduled patient contacts within 2 weeks of surgery. A total of 141 patients were identified. One hundred eighteen patients (83.7%) underwent same-day discharge and 23 (16.3%) required overnight admission. The variables that significantly predicted overnight admission were severe pain in the postanesthesia care unit (odds ratio [OR], 6.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.74-26.6; P = .006), delayed ability to tolerate oral intake (OR, 9.3; 95% CI, 2.25-38.6, P = .002), traditional laparoscopic vs robotic-assisted surgical approach (OR, 9.05; 95% CI, 2.34-35.1; P = .001), and surgery start time at 2:00 pm or later (OR, 36.8; 95% CI, 6.19-219.3; P < .0001). There was no difference in the readmission rate between patients undergoing same-day discharge compared with overnight admission (11% vs 17%, P = .48). No variables significantly predicted unscheduled patient contact within 2 weeks of surgery at P < .01.

Cancer screening rates in individuals with different life expectancies.,JAMA internal medicine,JAMA Intern Med,2014-10-01,"Routine cancer screening has unproven net benefit for patients with limited life expectancy. To examine the patterns of prostate, breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening in the United States in individuals with different life expectancies. Data from the population-based National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) from 2000 through 2010 were used and included 27 404 participants aged 65 years or older. Using a validated mortality index specific for NHIS, participants were grouped into those with low (<25%), intermediate (25%-49%), high (50%-74%), and very high (≥75%) risks of 9-year mortality. Rates of prostate, breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening. In participants with very high mortality risk, 31% to 55% received recent cancer screening, with prostate cancer screening being most common (55%). For women who had a hysterectomy for benign reasons, 34% to 56% had a Papanicolaou test within the past 3 years. On multivariate analysis, very high vs low mortality risk was associated with less screening for prostate (odds ratio [OR], 0.65 [95% CI, 0.50-0.85]), breast (OR, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.35-0.53]), and cervical (OR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.36-0.70]) cancers. There was less screening for prostate and cervical cancers in more recent years compared with 2000, and there was no significant interaction between calendar year and mortality risk for any cancer screening (P > .05 for all cancers). Our sensitivity analysis showed that screening was also common in individuals with less than 5-year life expectancy. A substantial proportion of the US population with limited life expectancy received prostate, breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening that is unlikely to provide net benefit.

Moderate hypothermia for intradural spinal tumor resection: a cohort comparison and feasibility study.,Therapeutic hypothermia and temperature management,Ther Hypothermia Temp Manag,2014-09-01,"To evaluate the safety and feasibility of modest hypothermia as a potential strategy for intraoperative neuroprotection during the removal of intradural spinal tumors. A retrospective review was performed for two groups of patients of a single surgeon who underwent intradural extrameduallary and intramedullary spinal tumor resection of tumors located between cervical level 1 and lumbar 2 over a 10-year period between 2001 and 2010. One cohort received intraoperative moderate hypothermia (33°C) via intravascular catheter cooling during tumor surgery and the second cohort, a historical control group of the same surgeon, underwent surgery at normothermia (≥36°C). The main outcome measured was safety as determined by surgical, medical, and neurological complications. The hypothermia (n=38) and nonhypothermia (n=34) groups were homogenous for patient demographics and baseline comorbidities. There were no differences between the groups regarding tumor level (p=0.51), tumor pathology, or intramedullary versus intradural extramedullary location (p=0.11). The hypothermia group had a lower mean body temperature (33.7°C±0.72 vs. 36.6°C±0.7, p≤0.001) longer postoperative hospital stays (10.8±14.0 vs. 7.3±4.72, p<0.001), but there were no significant differences in operative and perioperative variables such as, total anesthetic time (8.2±2.4 vs. 7.8±2.7 hours, p=0.45), total surgical time (5.9±2.1 vs. 5.7±2.5 hours, p=0.58), or estimated blood loss (483±420 vs. 420±314 mL, p=0.65). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups with respect to the rate of surgical (3 vs. 2, p=1.0), medical (4 vs. 3, p=1.0), neurological (3 vs. 4, p=0.7), or overall complications (10 vs. 9, p=1.0). In this study, moderate hypothermia via intravascular cooling catheters was successfully performed during 38 intradural spinal tumor surgeries. Compared to the historical control group, the hypothermia patients had longer hospital stays, but did not have higher complication rates.

Factors associated with poor quality of life among cervical cancer survivors: implications for clinical care and clinical trials.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2014-09-03,"The purpose of this study is to identify factors that are associated with poor quality of life (QOL) among cervical cancer survivors. Patients identified through the California Cancer Registry were recruited to participate in a randomized counseling intervention. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were collected at study baseline (9-30 months post-diagnosis) and subsequent to the intervention. Multivariable linear models were used to identify independent factors associated with poor baseline QOL. Non-Hispanic (N=121) and Hispanic (N=83) women aged 22-73 completed baseline measures. Approximately 50% of participants received radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy. Compared to the US population, cervical cancer patients reported lower QOL and significantly higher levels of depression and anxiety (26% and 28% >1 SD above the general population means, respectively). Among those in the lowest quartile for QOL, 63% had depression levels >1 SD above the mean. In addition, treatment with radiation±chemotherapy (p=0.014), and self-reported comorbidities predating the cancer diagnosis (p<0.001) were associated with lower QOL. Sociodemographic characteristics explained only a small portion of variance in QOL (r(2)=0.23). Persistent gynecologic problems, low social support, depression, somatization, less adaptive coping, comorbidities, sleep problems and low education were all independently associated with low QOL in multivariate analysis (r(2)=0.74). We have identified key psychological and physical health factors that contribute significantly to poor quality of life subsequent to definitive cancer treatment.

Currently, insufficient data exists to guide consensus guidelines and practical application of preoperative radiotherapy. Retrospective IRB approved cohort study from 1999 to 2014 of 36 endometrial cancer patients with clinical involvement of cervix±parametria treated with neoadjuvant external beam radiotherapy (45-50.4Gy in 25-28 fractions) and image-based HDR brachytherapy (5-5.5Gy times 3-4 fractions)±chemotherapy followed by extrafascial hysterectomy performed at a median of 6weeks after radiotherapy. All patients had clinical cervical extension, 50% also had parametria extension, and 31% had nodal involvement. At the time of surgery 91% had no clinical cervical involvement, 58% had no pathologic cervical involvement, and all had margin negative resection. The pathologic complete response rate was 24%. Median follow-up from the time of surgery was 20months (range: 0-153). The 3-year local control, regional control, distant control, disease free survival and overall survival rates were 96%, 89%, 84%, 73%, and 100%.

Differences between nurse practitioner and physician care providers on rates of secondary cancer screening and discussion of lifestyle changes among breast cancer survivors.,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,J Cancer Surviv,2014-10-09,"Breast cancer survivorship care is provided by surgical and medical oncologists, primary care physicians (PCPs), and nurse practitioner survivorship specialists (NPs). The study objective was to identify whether frequency of cancer screening and discussion of healthy lifestyles differed across these provider types. We also determined differences by provider in survivor reported follow through with lifestyle recommendations. Breast cancer survivors completed surveys regarding the type of health-care provider they most recently saw, cancer screening, discussion, and self-reported lifestyle change since their breast cancer diagnosis. Seven hundred fifty-nine breast cancer survivors (78.7 % of those invited) completed the survey; 51.8 % indicated that their last visit was with a medical oncologist. There was no difference in rates of cancer screening (colon, cervical, and breast) among types of providers. A significantly larger proportion of patients who last saw an NP reported that they had discussed physical activity (78.6 %) as compared to medical oncologist 54.4 %, surgeon 43.1 %, radiation oncologist 64.1 %, and PCP 61.3 % (p < 0.001). Similar observations were observed for discussion of nutrition and weight (NP 70.0 %, medical oncologist 36.5 %, surgeon 25.7 %, radiation oncologist 48.7 %, PCP 35.5 %; p < 0.001). There was no significant difference across provider type in self-reported implementation of change in physical activity or diet.

J. Gynecol. Cancer,2014-11-01,"Overexpression of bcl-2 is a mechanism of drug resistance in cervical cancer. Agents that down-regulate bcl-2 may decrease tumor cell threshold and sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy. The objective of this multi-institutional phase 2 trial was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of paclitaxel and bcl-2 modulators (13-cis retinoic acid and interferon alfa-2b) in patients with advanced-stage or recurrent cervical cancer. Patients had biopsy-proven metastatic, first relapse, or persistent cervical cancer with no prior chemotherapy except for chemosensitizing agents. The treatment consisted of oral 13-cis retinoic acid, 1 mg/kg, and subcutaneous interferon alfa-2b, 6 mU/m, days 1 to 4, and intravenous paclitaxel, 175 mg/m, day 4 until disease progression or adverse events prohibited treatment. The primary endpoint was overall response rate. Thirty-three patients were enrolled between March 2001 and June 2009. Thirty-one patients were eligible for evaluation of treatment response. Twenty-seven patients (82%) received prior concurrent chemoradiation or radiotherapy alone before study enrollment. The overall response rate was 30% (6 complete responses and 4 partial responses). Furthermore, 7 patients (21%) had stable disease. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events included neutropenia (n =16 [48%]), febrile neutropenia (n = 1 [3%]), and anemia (n = 1 [3%]). There were no treatment-related deaths. The median progression-free survival was 3.4 months (95% confidence interval, 2.0-7.4 months), and overall survival was 11.2 months (95% confidence interval, 7.5-26.2 months). Of 6 patients with complete responses, 5 patients survived more than 2 years. Combination therapy with paclitaxel, 13-cis retinoic acid, and interferon alfa-2b is feasible and safe in treating patients with advanced and recurrent cervical cancer.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",1907.0,5.0,Overexpression of bcl-2 is a mechanism of drug resistance in cancer Agents that down-regulate bcl-2 may decrease tumor cell threshold and sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy The objective of this multi-institutional phase 2 trial was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of paclitaxel and bcl-2 modulators 13-cis retinoic acid and interferon alfa-2b in patients with advanced-stage or recurrent cancer Patients had biopsy-proven metastatic first relapse or persistent cancer with no prior chemotherapy except for chemosensitizing agents The treatment consisted of oral 13-cis retinoic acid 1 mg/kg and subcutaneous interferon alfa-2b 6 mU/m days 1 to 4 and intravenous paclitaxel 175 mg/m day 4 until disease progression or adverse events prohibited treatment The primary endpoint was overall response rate Thirty-three patients were enrolled between March 2001 and June 2009 Thirty-one patients were eligible for evaluation of treatment response Twenty-seven patients 82 received prior concurrent chemoradiation or radiotherapy alone before study enrollment The overall response rate was 30 6 complete responses and 4 partial responses Furthermore 7 patients 21 had stable disease Grade 3 or 4 adverse events included neutropenia n =16 48 febrile neutropenia n 1 3 and anemia n 1 3 There were no treatment-related deaths The median progression-free survival was 3.4 months 95 confidence interval 2.0-7.4 months and overall survival was 11.2 months 95 confidence interval 7.5-26.2 months Of 6 patients with complete responses 5 patients survived more than 2 years Combination therapy with paclitaxel 13-cis retinoic acid and interferon alfa-2b is feasible and safe in treating patients with advanced and recurrent cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[851, 1, 1044, 18, 16, 8, 670, 1, 234, 251, 4, 12, 183, 17, 1328, 2288, 1044, 18, 68, 775, 30, 31, 2390, 2, 5745, 30, 37, 6, 56, 3, 461, 1, 26, 1414, 1115, 124, 18, 160, 10, 6, 376, 3, 209, 2, 155, 1, 490, 2, 1044, 18, 5014, 233, 1927, 3887, 971, 2, 1688, 4443, 3381, 4, 7, 5, 131, 82, 15, 387, 12, 7, 42, 411, 1930, 113, 157, 429, 15, 1882, 12, 5, 77, 324, 56, 2187, 9, 16829, 183, 3, 24, 1695, 1, 518, 233, 1927, 3887, 971, 14, 81, 503, 2, 2529, 1688, 4443, 3381, 49, 6601, 188, 162, 14, 6, 39, 2, 1262, 490, 3300, 81, 188, 218, 39, 1100, 34, 91, 15, 290, 281, 19105, 24, 3, 86, 1138, 10, 63, 51, 116, 977, 169, 7, 11, 346, 59, 2363, 1758, 2, 1924, 1238, 977, 104, 7, 11, 625, 9, 451, 1, 24, 51, 737, 648, 7, 878, 103, 324, 750, 975, 15, 310, 279, 348, 45, 1798, 3, 63, 51, 116, 10, 201, 49, 236, 253, 2, 39, 450, 253, 798, 67, 7, 239, 42, 585, 34, 88, 27, 15, 39, 290, 281, 159, 778, 78, 245, 576, 2498, 778, 78, 14, 27, 2, 1545, 78, 14, 27, 125, 11, 77, 24, 139, 1043, 3, 52, 91, 115, 25, 10, 27, 39, 53, 48, 307, 268, 18, 13, 67, 39, 53, 2, 63, 25, 10, 175, 18, 53, 48, 307, 268, 67, 33, 432, 18, 53, 1, 49, 7, 5, 236, 253, 33, 7, 2996, 80, 76, 18, 60, 150, 36, 5, 490, 233, 1927, 3887, 971, 2, 1688, 4443, 3381, 16, 1313, 2, 1165, 4, 1367, 7, 5, 131, 2, 387, 12]",1723.0,25304678,143
Comparison and consensus guidelines for delineation of clinical target volume for CT- and MR-based brachytherapy in locally advanced cervical cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2014-10-01,"To create and compare consensus clinical target volume (CTV) contours for computed tomography (CT) and 3-Tesla (3-T) magnetic resonance (MR) image-based cervical-cancer brachytherapy. Twenty-three experts in gynecologic radiation oncology contoured the same 3 cervical cancer brachytherapy cases: 1 stage IIB near-complete response (CR) case with a tandem and ovoid, 1 stage IIB partial response (PR) case with tandem and ovoid with needles, and 1 stage IB2 CR case with a tandem and ring applicator. The CT contours were completed before the MRI contours. These were analyzed for consistency and clarity of target delineation using an expectation maximization algorithm for simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE), with κ statistics as a measure of agreement between participants. The conformity index was calculated for each of the 6 data sets. Dice coefficients were generated to compare the CT and MR contours of the same case. For all 3 cases, the mean tumor volume was smaller on MR than on CT (P<.001). The κ and conformity index estimates were slightly higher for CT, indicating a higher level of agreement on CT. The Dice coefficients were 89% for the stage IB2 case with a CR, 74% for the stage IIB case with a PR, and 57% for the stage IIB case with a CR. In a comparison of MR-contoured with CT-contoured CTV volumes, the higher level of agreement on CT may be due to the more distinct contrast medium visible on the images at the time of brachytherapy. MR at the time of brachytherapy may be of greatest benefit in patients with large tumors with parametrial extension that have a partial or complete response to external beam. On the basis of these results, a 95% consensus volume was generated for CT and for MR.

A multicenter phase 1 study of γ -secretase inhibitor RO4929097 in combination with capecitabine in refractory solid tumors.,Investigational new drugs,Invest New Drugs,2014-10-17,"RO4929097 is an oral inhibitor of γ -secretase that results in Notch signaling inhibition. Prior work has demonstrated that Notch signaling inhibition enhances chemotherapy sensitivity of cancer cells. This phase I study was conducted to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD), toxicities and efficacy of RO4929097 and capecitabine in advanced solid tumors. Patients with refractory solid tumors received capecitabine at a fixed dose of 1,000 mg/m(2) twice daily with escalating doses of RO4929097 on a 21-day cycle in a 3 + 3 design. Capecitabine was administered for 14 days and the RO49029097 once daily, 3 days per week, both for a 21 day cycle. Thirty patients were treated on six dose levels (20 to 150 mg). The maximally tolerated dose was not reached. One dose limiting toxicity was observed at each level 3 through 6 (hypophosphatemia, fatigue, and nausea/vomiting). Three confirmed partial responses were observed: two patients with fluoropyrimide-refractory colon cancer and one patient with cervical cancer. Autoinduction of RO4929097 was demonstrated with increasing dose levels and duration.

Hydronephrosis in patients with cervical cancer: an assessment of morbidity and survival.,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,Support Care Cancer,2014-10-23,"Hydronephrosis is a frequently observed but understudied complication in patients with cervical cancer. To better characterize hydronephrosis in cervical cancer patients, the current study sought (1) to describe hydronephrosis-associated morbidity and (2) to analyze the prognostic effect of hydronephrosis in patients with a broad range of cancer stages over time. The Mayo Clinic Tumor Registry was interrogated for all invasive cervical cancer patients seen at the Mayo Clinic from 2008 through 2013 in Rochester, Minnesota; these patients' medical records were then reviewed in detail. Two hundred seventy-nine cervical cancer patients with a median age of 49 years and a range of cancer stages were included. Sixty-five patients (23 %) were diagnosed with hydronephrosis at some point during their disease course. In univariate analyses, hydronephrosis was associated with advanced cancer stage (p < 0.0001), squamous histology (p = 0.0079), and nonsurgical cancer treatment (p = 0.0039). In multivariate analyses, stage and tumor histology were associated with hydronephrosis. All but one patient underwent stent placement or urinary diversion; hydronephrosis-related morbidity included pain, urinary tract infections, nausea and vomiting, renal failure, and urinary tract bleeding. In landmark univariate survival analyses, hydronephrosis was associated with worse survival at all time points. In landmark multivariate analyses (adjusted for patient age, stage, cancer treatment, and tumor histology), hydronephrosis was associated with a trend toward worse survival over time (hazard ratios ranged from 1.47 to 4.69).

Factors associated with grade 3 or 4 treatment-related toxicity in women with advanced or recurrent cervical cancer: an exploratory analysis of NRG Oncology/Gynecologic Oncology Group trials 179 and 204.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2015-02-01,"This study aimed to describe pretreatment patient characteristics and baseline quality-of-life scores as they relate to the development of grade 3 or 4 toxicity in patients receiving chemotherapy for advanced/recurrent cervical cancer. The study sample was drawn from Gynecologic Oncology Group protocols 179 and 204. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities were considered in 4 specified categories as follows: peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, hematological, and gastrointestinal (GI). The data variables explored included age, stage, pretreatment radiation, performance status (PS) at treatment initiation, and baseline Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cervix (FACT-Cx) score. A logistic regression model was developed with various adverse events as binary (0/1) outcomes. Six hundred seventy-three patient-reported questionnaires were used in the analyses. At baseline, pain was the most severe patient-reported symptom. Baseline line-item patient concerns did demonstrate specific correlations with the development of individual toxicities. In 401 patients who were enrolled on Gynecologic Oncology Group 204 (fatigue not measured on 179), a worse PS predicted the development of grade 3 or 4 fatigue (odds ratio, 2.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.66-4.68). Exposure to previous radiation, treatment regimen, and a worse FACT-Cx score were associated with the reporting of both grade 3 or 4 leukopenia (P < 0.05) and anemia (P < 0.0005). Performance status and treatment regimen (P < 0.05) were associated with the development of grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia. Age and treatment regimen (P < 0.05) were associated with the development of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. The FACT-Cx score (P = 0.0016) predicted grade 3 or 4 GI toxicity.

"Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation, safety, and pharmacokinetics study of ME-344 as a single agent in patients with refractory solid tumors.",Cancer,Cancer,2014-11-19,"The current phase 1, open-label, dose escalation study was conducted to establish the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, and preliminary antitumor activity of the novel mitochondrial inhibitor ME-344 in patients with refractory solid tumors. Patients with refractory solid tumors were treated in a 3 + 3 dose escalation design. ME-344 was administered via intravenous infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 of the first 28-day cycle and weekly thereafter. Pharmacokinetics was assessed on days 1 and 15 of the first cycle. A total of 30 patients (median age, 65 years; 67% of whom were female) received ME-344. There were 5 dose-limiting toxicities reported. Four patients developed grade 3 neuropathy (2 patients each at doses of 15 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg) and 1 patient treated at a dose of 10 mg/kg developed a grade 3 acute myocardial infarction (toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 4.03]). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as 10 mg/kg weekly. The most common adverse events were nausea, dizziness, and fatigue. At the MTD of 10 mg/kg, the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) was 25.8 µg/mL and the area under the concentration curve from time zero to infinity was 25.9 hour*µg/mL. One patient with small cell lung cancer achieved a partial response for ≥ 52 weeks. Four patients had prolonged stable disease (1 patient each with urothelial carcinoma [47 weeks], carcinoid tumor [≥ 40 weeks], cervical leiomyosarcoma [39 weeks], and cervical cancer [≥ 31 weeks]).

This retrospective cohort study of patients with stages IB1-IVA cervical cancer treated with curative intent at MD Anderson Cancer Center from 1980 through 2007 categorized these women as underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, or morbidly obese according to National Institutes of Health definitions. In addition to weight category, known prognostic factors for survival after a diagnosis of cervical cancer were included in a multivariate model. These known prognostic factors included age, smoking status, race or ethnicity (self-reported), socioeconomic status, comorbidities, tumor histologic subtype, tumor stage, tumor size, presence or absence of hydronephrosis, radiologic evidence of nodal metastasis, and the addition of concurrent chemotherapy with definitive radiation. A total of 3,086 patients met the inclusion criteria. The median survival for the entire cohort was 81 months (range 0-365 months).

Multiple biopsies and detection of cervical cancer precursors at colposcopy.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2014-11-24,"Women with abnormal cervical cancer screening results are referred to colposcopy and biopsy for diagnosis of cervical cancer precursors (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions [HSILs]). Colposcopy with a single biopsy can miss identification of HSILs. No systematic study has quantified the improved detection of HSIL by taking multiple lesion-directed biopsies. The Biopsy Study was an observational study of 690 women referred to colposcopy after abnormal cervical cancer screening results. Up to four directed biopsies were taken from distinct acetowhite lesions and ranked by colposcopic impression. A nondirected biopsy of a normal-appearing area was added if fewer than four directed biopsies were taken. HSIL identified by any biopsy was the reference standard of disease used to evaluate the incremental yield and sensitivity of multiple biopsies. In the overall population, sensitivities for detecting HSIL increased from 60.6% (95% CI, 54.8% to 66.6%) from a single biopsy to 85.6% (95% CI, 80.3% to 90.2%) after two biopsies and to 95.6% (95% CI, 91.3% to 99.2%) after three biopsies. A significant increase in sensitivity of multiple biopsies was observed in all subgroups. The highest increase in yield of HSIL was observed for women with a high-grade colposcopic impression, HSIL cytology, and human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 positivity. Only 2% of all HSILs diagnosed in the participants were detected by biopsies of normal-appearing transformation zone.

Following locoregional therapies (including surgical salvage of residual cervical nodes), no standard intervention exists. Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), an ErbB family member, is associated with poor prognosis in HNSCC. EGFR-targeted cetuximab is the only targeted therapy that impacts overall survival and is approved for HNSCC in the USA or Europe. However, resistance often occurs, and new approaches, such as targeting multiple ErbB family members, may be required. Afatinib, an irreversible ErbB family blocker, demonstrated antiproliferative activity in preclinical models and comparable clinical efficacy with cetuximab in a randomized phase II trial in recurrent or metastatic HNSCC. LUX-Head & Neck 2, a phase III study, will assess adjuvant afatinib versus placebo following chemoradiotherapy in primary unresected locoregionally advanced intermediate-to-high-risk HNSCC. Patients with primary unresected locoregionally advanced HNSCC, in good clinical condition with unfavourable risk of recurrence, and no evidence of disease after chemoradiotherapy will be randomized 2:1 to oral once-daily afatinib (40 mg starting dose) or placebo. As HPV status will not be determined for eligibility, unfavourable risk is defined as non-oropharynx primary site or oropharynx cancer in patients with a smoking history (>10 pack-years). Treatment will continue for 18 months or until recurrence or unacceptable adverse events occur. The primary endpoint measure is duration of disease-free survival; secondary endpoint measures are disease-free survival rate at 2 years, overall survival, health-related quality of life and safety. Given the unmet need in the adjuvant treatment of intermediate-to-high-risk HNSCC patients, it is expected that LUX-Head & Neck 2 will provide new insights into treatment in this setting and might demonstrate the ability of afatinib to significantly improve disease-free survival, compared with placebo.

State Medicaid expansion decisions and disparities in women's cancer screening.,American journal of preventive medicine,Am J Prev Med,2014-10-30,"There are substantial disparities in breast and cervical cancer screening that stem from lack of health insurance. Although the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expands insurance coverage to many Americans, there are differences in availability of Medicaid coverage across states. To understand the potential impact of Medicaid expansions on disparities in preventive care for low-income women by assessing pre-ACA breast and cervical cancer screening across states currently expanding and not expanding Medicaid to low-income adults. Data from the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (analyzed in 2014) were used to consider differences in demographics among women for whom screening is recommended, including income and race/ethnicity, across expansion and nonexpansion states. Self-reported screening was compared by state expansion status overall, for the uninsured, and for low-income women. Logistic regressions were estimated to assess differences in self-reported screening across expansion and nonexpansion states controlling for demographics. Women in states that are not expanding Medicaid had significantly lower odds of receiving recommended mammograms (OR=0.87, 95% CI=0.79, 0.95) or Pap tests (OR=0.87, 95% CI=0.79, 0.95). The difference was larger among the uninsured (OR=0.72, 95% CI=0.56, 0.91 for mammography; OR=0.78, 95% CI=0.65, 0.94 for Pap tests).

Relationship between low hemoglobin levels and outcomes after treatment with radiation or chemoradiation in patients with cervical cancer: has the impact of anemia been overstated?,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2014-10-25,"Previous reports have suggested that anemia increases rates of recurrence after radiation therapy for cervical cancer. However, these studies may not have fully corrected for confounding risk factors. Using a well-characterized cohort of cervical cancer patients, we examined the association between anemia and outcomes before and after the introduction of chemoradiation as standard of care. We reviewed the records of 2454 patients who underwent definitive radiation therapy from 1980 through 2011. Minimum hemoglobin level (Hgbmin) was recorded for 2359 patients (96%). Endpoints included freedom from central recurrence (FFCR), freedom from distant metastasis (FFDM), and disease-specific survival (DSS). For the entire cohort, hemoglobin concentrations of 9, 10, and 12 g/dL before and during radiation were all significantly associated with FFCR, FFDM, and DSS (all P<.001) on univariate analysis. However, on multivariate analysis, only Hgbmin less than 10 g/dL during RT (RT-Hgb<10) remained significant, and it was correlated with lower DSS (P=.02, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.28) and FFDM (P=.03, HR = 1.33) but not with FFCR. In a subset analysis of patients receiving chemoradiation (n=678), RT-Hgb<10 was associated only with DSS (P=.008, HR = 1.49), not with FFCR or FFDM. In this subgroup, despite an association between RT-Hgb<10 and DSS, the use of transfusion was not correlated with benefit. No evidence was found supporting anemia as an independent predictor of central recurrence in patients treated with definitive radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy.

Significance of lymph node ratio in defining risk category in node-positive early stage cervical cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2014-11-18,"The ratio of positive to negative lymph nodes, or lymph node ratio (LNR), is an important prognostic factor in several solid tumors. The objective of this study was to determine if LNR can be used to define a high-risk category of patients with node-positive early stage cervical cancer. We performed a retrospective review of patients diagnosed with node-positive stage I or II cervical cancer who underwent radical hysterectomy and pelvic +/- para-aortic lymphadenectomy at MD Anderson from January 1990 to December 2011. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify prognostic factors for progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Ninety-five patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Median total nodes removed were 19 (range 1-58), and median number of positive nodes was 1 (range 1-12). Fifty-eight patients (61%) received radiation with concurrent cisplatin and 27 patients (28%) received radiotherapy alone. Twenty-one (22%) patients recurred. On multivariate analysis, a LNR > 6.6% was associated with a worse PFS (HR = 2.97, 95% CI 1.26-7.02, p = 0.01), and a LNR > 7.6% with a worse OS (HR = 3.96, 95% CI 1.31-11.98, p = 0.01).

Supratentorial extraventricular anaplastic ependymoma with extracranial metastasis.,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,J Clin Neurosci,2014-10-31,"Ependymoma is a relatively rare malignancy accounting for 2.0% of all primary central nervous system tumors in adults. Extracranial metastasis is a very uncommon complication of gliomas, especially of anaplastic ependymomas. The objective of this paper is to show that ependymomas can metastasize to soft tissue and lymph nodes as well as to share our approach to this challenge. We report a male patient with anaplastic ependymoma that recurred, metastasizing to the neck and lymph nodes. Metastatic disease was diagnosed based on clinical presentation of a palpable nodule on the right neck and diffuse cervical lymphadenopathies. A biopsy was obtained and pathology revealed anaplastic ependymoma. Whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan showed metastatic disease in the right mastoid region with diffuse uptake in the cervical lymph nodes. Clinical and radiologic response was achieved after three chemotherapy cycles of etoposide, cisplatin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide. This case highlights extracranial metastasis to the soft tissue as an atypical presentation of recurrent anaplastic ependymoma. Other reported instances of extracranial metastatic ependymoma with this presentation are discussed. The possible metastatic pathways of intracranial disease are discussed. It also illustrates how extracranial disease remains stable with systemic chemotherapy.

Significance of lymphovascular space invasion in uterine serous carcinoma: what matters more; extent or presence?,International journal of gynecological pathology : official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Pathologists,Int. J. Gynecol. Pathol.,2015-01-01,"To analyze the clinical significance of the extent of lymphovascular space invasion (LVI) in patients with uterine serous carcinoma. After IRB approval, 232 patients with uterine serous carcinoma from the pathology databases of 4 large academic institutions were included. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on extent of LVI. Extensive LVI (E-LVI) was defined as ≥3 vessel involvement; low LVI (L-LVI) was defined <3 vessel involvement; and the third group consisted of tumors with no LVI (A-LVI). The association between LVI and myometrial invasion, cervical involvement, lower uterine segment involvement, positive peritoneal washings, lymph node involvement, stage, and survival were analyzed. Of 232 patients, 47 had E-LVI (20.3%), 83 had L-LVI (35.8%), and 102 had A-LVI (44%). A total of 9.8% of the patients with A-LVI had lymph node involvement as compared with 18.1% in the L-LVI group and 55.4% in the E-LVI group (P<0.0001). Fifty-nine percent of the patients in A-LVI, 85% in L-LVI, and 100% in the E-LVI group demonstrated myometrial invasion (P<0.0001). Cervical involvement was noted in 23%, 43%, 66% (P<0.0001) and lower uterine segment involvement involvement in 31%, 43%, and 42% of A-LVI, L-LVI, and E-LVI (P<0.0001), respectively. Stage III and IV disease were seen in 29%, 38%, and 79% of the patients with A-LVI, L-LVI, and E-LVI, respectively (P<0.0001). The median overall survival was 172, 95, and 39 mo for the A-LVI, L-LVI, and E-LVI groups, respectively (P<0.0001). The racial distribution was significant with African American patients demonstrating significantly more L-LVI (27.8%) and E-LVI (40.4%) when compared with A-LVI (19.6%) (P=0.040). In a subgroup analysis including patients with Stage I and II (n=123) revealed median survivals of 172, 169, and 38 mo in the A-LVI, L-LVI, and E-LVI groups, respectively (P<0.0001). Fifty percent of these patients with E-LVI, 20% in L-LVI group, and 15% in A-LVI group had disease recurrence (P=0.040).

Establishing translational and clinical cancer research collaborations between high- and low-income countries.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2015-01-09,"Both infectious and noninfectious related malignancies are a growing problem in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). It is difficult to extrapolate data and guidelines regarding cancer care from high-income countries (HIC) to cancer patients in LMIC. Due to the rise in noncommunicable cancer rates, there is a widening gap between the need for evidence-based treatments for cancer control plans and existing research capabilities. Surgeons frequently provide all surgical and medical oncology treatments for patients in LMIC for diseases, such as breast, gastric, cervical, and colorectal cancers. Surgical oncology clinical and translational research collaborations, however, are lacking. There are several successful consortiums that focus on HIV- and infectious-related malignancies. These collaborations can be used as an example for future surgical research efforts. The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center-Nigerian collaboration that is concentrating on colorectal cancer is used as an example of how to initiate a research collaboration that can build research infrastructure and provide the necessary data to generate realistic treatment guidelines. The need for expanded surgical oncology research and the growing population of patients with noninfectious-related malignancies in LMIC has created a unique opportunity for surgeons to initiate and lead clinical and translational research collaborations between HIC and LMIC.

"Escalation of oncologic services at the end of life among patients with gynecologic cancer at an urban, public hospital.",Journal of oncology practice,J Oncol Pract,2015-01-20,"Use of oncology-related services is increasingly scrutinized, yet precisely which services are actually rendered to patients, particularly at the end of life, is unknown. This study characterizes the end-of-life use of medical services by patients with gynecologic cancer at a safety-net hospital. Oncologic history and metrics of medical use (eg, hospitalizations, chemotherapy infusions, procedures) for patients with gynecologic oncology who died between December 2006 and February 2012 were evaluated. Mixed-effect regression models were used to test time effects and construct usage summaries. Among 116 subjects, cervical cancer accounted for the most deaths (42%). The median age at diagnosis was 55 years; 63% were Hispanic, and 65% had advanced disease. Only 34% died in hospice care. The median times from do not resuscitate/do not intubate documentation and from last therapeutic intervention to death were 9 days and 55 days, respectively. Significant time effects for all services (eg, hospitalizations, diagnostics, procedures, treatments, clinic appointments) were detected during the patient's final year (P < .001), with the most dramatic changes occurring during the last 2 months. Patients with longer duration of continuity of care used significantly fewer resources toward the end of life.

Optimizing packing contrast for MRI-based intracavitary brachytherapy planning for cervical cancer.,Brachytherapy,Brachytherapy,2015-01-22,"We prospectively tested five variations in vaginal gauze packing in an effort to improve contrast between the packing, cervix, and applicator for MRI-based intracavitary brachytherapy planning. Five patients enrolled on a prospective study from May 2013 to October 2013 received MRI-based intracavitary brachytherapy for cervical cancer with variations of impregnated gauze packing. Substances tested included antibiotic cream alone, antibiotic cream mixed with ultrasound gel, conjugated estrogens cream mixed with ultrasound gel, ultrasound gel alone, and gadolinium. Images from the T2-weighted pelvic MRI were used to obtain signal intensity measurements at points within the packing, cervix, and applicator. Signal intensity values were normalized using the signal-to-noise ratio and compared using an unpaired t-test. Ultrasound gel-impregnated gauze allowed for the greatest contrast between the packing and the cervix with a difference in mean normalized signal intensity of 38.2 (p < 0.01). Conjugated estrogens cream mixed with ultrasound gel and gadolinium also provided contrast when compared with cervix, with differences in mean normalized signal intensity of 25.3 and -16.2, respectively (p < 0.01 for both). For all variations but gadolinium, the normalized mean signal intensity of the packing was found to be significantly different from the applicator, with the ultrasound gel again demonstrating the greatest contrast with a difference of 42.5 (p < 0.01). Gauze impregnated with ultrasound gel, conjugated estrogens cream mixed with ultrasound gel, and gadolinium allowed for a significant difference in MRI signal intensity between the packing and the cervix.

Outcomes for advanced cervical adenocarcinoma remain poor. Precision mapping of genetic alterations in cervical adenocarcinoma may enable better selection of therapies and deliver improved outcomes when combined with new sequencing diagnostics. We present whole-exome sequencing results from 15 cervical adenocarcinomas and paired normal samples from Hong Kong Chinese women. These data revealed a heterogeneous mutation spectrum and identified several frequently altered genes including FAT1, ARID1A, ERBB2 and PIK3CA. Exome sequencing identified human papillomavirus (HPV) sequences in 13 tumors in which the HPV genome might have integrated into and hence disrupted the functions of certain exons, raising the possibility that HPV integration can alter pathways other than p53 and pRb.

Biol.,2015-01-01,"Cervical cancer causes 275,000 deaths each year with 85 % of these deaths occurring in the developing world. One of the primary reasons for the concentration of deaths in developing countries is a lack of effective screening methods suited for the infrastructure of these countries. In order to address this need, we have developed a high-resolution microendoscope (HRME). The HRME is a fiber-based fluorescence microscope with subcellular resolution.

Postoperative proton therapy for chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the spine: adjuvant versus salvage radiation therapy.,Spine,Spine,2015-04-01,"Retrospective comparative cohort series. The aim of this study was to evaluate patients treated with proton therapy for chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the spine in the postoperative setting and to report local control, relapse-free, and overall survival outcomes. Margin-negative resection of spinal chordomas and chondrosarcomas can be challenging, so adjuvant radiotherapy is often recommended. However, delivery of adequate radiotherapy is complicated by the relative radioresistance of these tumors, necessitating high doses, as well as the proximity of the spinal cord and exiting nerve roots increasing the risk for toxicity. Proton radiotherapy has favorable physical properties for avoiding nearby nontarget structures and is increasingly used for such lesions. Nineteen patients who underwent postoperative proton therapy at a single institution from 2006 to 2012 were identified including 13 with chordoma and 6 with chondrosarcoma. Surgical approach varied by tumor location in the cervical (n = 3), thoracic (n = 1), lumbar (n = 2), or sacral (n = 13) spine. Eight patients were categorized as receiving ""early adjuvant"" and 11 patients as receiving ""salvage"" treatment, as determined by initiation of radiation therapy after primary surgery or local recurrence, respectively. The median radiation dose delivered was 70 Gy relative biologic effectiveness (range: 56-78 Gy relative biologic effectiveness). For the entire cohort, 2-year local control, relapse-free survival, and overall survival were 58%, 51.9%, and 93.3%, respectively. The early adjuvant group had significantly higher 2-year local control (80% vs. 45.5%; P = 0.024). Patients referred early for primary adjuvant radiation therapy after surgery had higher rates of disease control than those referred for salvage treatment of recurrent disease. Recurrence rates in our cohort were higher overall than other published series, indicating that even higher radiation doses may be helpful for further improving local control in the presence of gross or recurrent disease. 3.",Comparative Study,1756.0,43.0,Retrospective comparative cohort series The aim of this study was to evaluate patients treated with proton therapy for chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the spine in the postoperative setting and to report local control relapse-free and overall survival outcomes Margin-negative resection of spinal chordomas and chondrosarcomas can be challenging so adjuvant radiotherapy is often recommended However delivery of adequate radiotherapy is complicated by the relative radioresistance of these tumors necessitating high doses as well as the proximity of the spinal cord and exiting nerve roots increasing the risk for toxicity Proton radiotherapy has favorable physical properties for avoiding nearby nontarget structures and is increasingly used for such lesions Nineteen patients who underwent postoperative proton therapy at a single institution from 2006 to 2012 were identified including 13 with chordoma and 6 with chondrosarcoma Surgical approach varied by tumor location in the n 3 thoracic n 1 lumbar n 2 or sacral n 13 spine Eight patients were categorized as receiving `` early adjuvant '' and 11 patients as receiving `` salvage '' treatment as determined by initiation of radiation therapy after primary surgery or local recurrence respectively The median radiation dose delivered was 70 Gy relative biologic effectiveness range 56-78 Gy relative biologic effectiveness For the entire cohort 2-year local control relapse-free survival and overall survival were 58 51.9 and 93.3 respectively The early adjuvant group had significantly higher 2-year local control 80 vs. 45.5 P 0.024 Patients referred early for primary adjuvant radiation therapy after surgery had higher rates of disease control than those referred for salvage treatment of recurrent disease Recurrence rates in our cohort were higher overall than other published series indicating that even higher radiation doses may be helpful for further improving local control in the presence of gross or recurrent disease 3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[459, 2352, 180, 988, 3, 1130, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 376, 7, 73, 5, 2095, 36, 9, 3911, 2, 6116, 1, 3, 2342, 4, 3, 573, 546, 2, 6, 414, 293, 182, 429, 115, 2, 63, 25, 123, 959, 199, 170, 1, 1499, 6790, 2, 11960, 122, 40, 1950, 1743, 249, 310, 16, 629, 793, 137, 989, 1, 1658, 310, 16, 4286, 20, 3, 580, 7052, 1, 46, 57, 8365, 64, 415, 22, 149, 22, 3, 6167, 1, 3, 1499, 1885, 2, 35957, 2476, 19672, 602, 3, 43, 9, 155, 2095, 310, 71, 913, 900, 1571, 9, 6048, 10789, 12756, 2414, 2, 16, 1635, 95, 9, 225, 406, 3498, 7, 54, 208, 573, 2095, 36, 28, 8, 226, 731, 29, 1324, 6, 1195, 11, 108, 141, 233, 5, 3911, 2, 49, 5, 6116, 221, 353, 2051, 20, 30, 1147, 4, 3, 78, 27, 2098, 78, 14, 6187, 78, 18, 15, 7943, 78, 233, 2342, 659, 7, 11, 2320, 22, 357, 191, 249, 522, 2, 175, 7, 22, 357, 992, 522, 24, 22, 509, 20, 1118, 1, 121, 36, 50, 86, 152, 15, 293, 146, 106, 3, 52, 121, 61, 1623, 10, 431, 381, 580, 1283, 1236, 184, 664, 833, 381, 580, 1283, 1236, 9, 3, 1797, 180, 18, 111, 293, 182, 429, 115, 25, 2, 63, 25, 11, 717, 725, 83, 2, 966, 27, 106, 3, 191, 249, 87, 42, 97, 142, 18, 111, 293, 182, 493, 105, 512, 33, 19, 13, 4247, 7, 1995, 191, 9, 86, 249, 121, 36, 50, 152, 42, 142, 151, 1, 34, 182, 76, 135, 1995, 9, 992, 24, 1, 387, 34, 146, 151, 4, 114, 180, 11, 142, 63, 76, 127, 983, 988, 1716, 17, 871, 142, 121, 415, 68, 40, 3951, 9, 195, 1673, 293, 182, 4, 3, 463, 1, 1789, 15, 387, 34, 27]",1987.0,25627289,106
"Bevacizumab for advanced cervical cancer: patient-reported outcomes of a randomised, phase 3 trial (NRG Oncology-Gynecologic Oncology Group protocol 240).",The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2015-01-29,"GOG 240 was a practice-changing randomised phase 3 trial that concluded that chemotherapy plus bevacizumab for advanced cervical cancer significantly improves overall and progression-free survival, and the proportion of patients achieving an overall objective response, compared with chemotherapy alone. In this study, we aimed to analyse patient-reported outcomes in GOG 240. Eligible adult participants (aged ≥18 years) had primary stage IVB or recurrent or persistent carcinoma of the cervix with measurable disease and GOG performance status of 0-1. Participants were randomly assigned by web-based permuted block randomisation (block size 4) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to the four treatment groups: cisplatin (50 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1 or 2 of the treatment cycle) and paclitaxel (135 mg/m(2) intravenously over 24 h or 175 mg/m(2) intravenously over 3 h on day 1), with or without bevacizumab (15 mg/kg intravenously on day 1 or 2), or paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2) over 3 h on day 1) and topotecan (0·75 mg/m(2) for 30 min on days 1-3) with or without bevacizumab (15 mg/kg intravenously on day 1). Treatment assignment was concealed at randomisation (everyone was masked to treatment assignment, achieved by the use of a computer encrypted numbering system at the National Cancer Institute) and became open-label when each patient was registered to the trial. Treatment cycles were repeated every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurred first. The coprimary endpoints of the trial were overall survival and safety; the primary quality-of-life endpoint was the score on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cervix Trial Outcome Index (FACT-Cx TOI). For our analysis of patient-reported outcomes, participants were assessed before treatment cycles 1, 2, and 5, and at 6 and 9 months after the start of cycle 1, with the FACT-Cx TOI, items from the FACT-GOG-Neurotoxicity subscale, and a worst pain item from the Brief Pain Inventory. All patients who completed baseline quality-of-life assessments and at least one further follow-up assessment were evaluable for quality-of-life outcomes. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00803062. Between April 6, 2009, and Jan 3, 2012, a total of 452 patients were enrolled in the trial, of whom 390 completed baseline quality-of-life assessment and at least one further assessment and were therefore evaluable for quality-of-life outcomes. In these patients, patient-reported outcome completion declined from 426 (94%) of 452 (at baseline) to 193 (63%) of 307 (9 months post-cycle 1), but completion rates did not differ significantly between treatment regimens (p=0·78). The baseline FACT-Cx TOI scores did not differ significantly between patients who received bevacizumab versus those who did not (p=0·27). Compared with patients who received chemotherapy alone, patients who received chemotherapy plus bevacizumab reported FACT-Cx TOI scores that were an average of 1·2 points lower (98·75% CI -4·1 to 1·7; p=0·30). Improvements in overall survival and progression-free survival attributed to the incorporation of bevacizumab into the treatment of advanced cervical cancer were not accompanied by any significant deterioration in health-related quality of life. Patients responding to anti-angiogenesis therapy who maintain an acceptable quality of life could be suitable at progression for treatment with other novel therapies that might confer additional benefit.

[Juglone inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of human cervical squamous cancer SiHa cells].,Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi,2015-02-01,"To explore the effect of juglone on proliferation and apoptosis of human cervical squamous cancer SiHa cells. Cultured SiHa cells in the exponential growth phase were grouped into blank control group and 10, 20, 50, 80 and 100 μmol/L juglone treatment groups. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay was adopted to observe the inhibitory effect of juglone on the proliferation of SiHa cells, and then 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated through formula. Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining and flow cytometry were used to detect the effect of 20 μmol/L juglone on SiHa cell apoptosis. Western blot was applied to determine the expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax.

Radical Trachelectomy for Early-Stage Cervical Cancer: A Survey of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology and Gynecologic Oncology Fellows-in-Training.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2015-05-01,"The aim of this study was to survey gynecologic oncologists and fellows-in-training regarding the role of radical trachelectomy (RT) and conservative surgery in patients with early-stage cervical cancer. From June 2012 to September 2012, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology member practitioners (n = 1353) and gynecologic oncology fellows (n = 156) were sent group-specific surveys investigating current practice, training, and the future of RT for early-stage cervical cancer management. Twenty-two percent of practitioners (n = 303) and 24.4% of fellows (n = 38) completed the surveys. Of the practitioners, 50% (n = 148) report performing RT, 98% (n = 269) support RT as treatment for squamous carcinoma, and 71% (n = 195) confirm the use of RT for adenocarcinoma. Most practitioners offer RT treatment for stages IA2 to IB1 smaller than 2 cm (n = 209, 76.8%) regardless of grade (77.7%) or lymph vascular space invasion (n = 211, 79.3%). Only 8% (n = 23) of practitioners feel that RT is appropriate for stage IBI larger than 2 cm. Respectively, both practitioners and fellows most frequently perform robotic-assisted (47.0%, n = 101 and 59.1%, n = 13) and abdominal (40.5%, n = 87 and 68.2%, n = 15) RT approaches. After training, fellows project the use of robotic-assisted (71%, n = 22) or abdominal methods (58.1%, n = 18). Overall, 75% (n = 227) of practitioners and 60% (n = 23) of fellows speculate that over the next 5 years, less radical procedures will be used to manage early-stage cervical cancer. Our findings suggest that practitioners and fellows believe RT remains an option for early-stage cervical cancer patients.

J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2015-01-30,"Image-based brachytherapy is increasingly used for gynecologic malignancies. We report early outcomes of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided brachytherapy. Consecutive patient cases with FIGO stage IB1 to IVA cervical cancer treated at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. All patients received concurrent cisplatin with external beam radiation therapy along with interdigitated high-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy. Computed tomography or MRI was completed after each application, the latter acquired for at least 1 fraction. High-risk clinical target volume (HRCTV) and organs at risk were identified by Groupe Européen de Curiethérapie and European SocieTy for Radiotherapy and Oncology guidelines. Doses were converted to equivalent 2-Gy doses (EQD2) with planned HRCTV doses of 75 to 85 Gy. From 2007 to 2013, 128 patients, median 52 years of age, were treated. Predominant characteristics included stage IIB disease (58.6%) with a median tumor size of 5 cm, squamous histology (82.8%), and no radiographic nodal involvement (53.1%). Most patients (67.2%) received intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) at a median dose of 45 Gy, followed by a median brachytherapy dose of 27.5 Gy (range, 25-30 Gy) in 5 fractions. At a median follow up of 24.4 months (range, 2.1-77.2 months), estimated 2-year local control, disease-free survival, and cancer-specific survival rates were 91.6%, 81.8%, and 87.6%, respectively. Predictors of local failure included adenocarcinoma histology (P<.01) and clinical response at 3 months (P<.01). Among the adenocarcinoma subset, receiving HRCTV D90 EQD2 ≥84 Gy was associated with improved local control (2-year local control rate 100% vs 54.5%, P=.03). Grade 3 or greater gastrointestinal or genitourinary late toxicity occurred at a 2-year actuarial rate of 0.9%.

The Impact of Near-Universal Insurance Coverage on Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening: Evidence from Massachusetts.,Health economics,Health Econ,2015-02-18,"This paper investigates the effect of expansion to near-universal health insurance coverage in Massachusetts on breast and cervical cancer screening. We use data from 2002 to 2010 to compare changes in receipt of mammograms and Pap tests in Massachusetts relative to other New England states. We also consider the effect specifically among low-income women. We find positive effects of Massachusetts health reform on cancer screening, suggesting a 4 to 5% increase in mammograms and 6 to 7% increase in Pap tests annually. Increases in both breast and cervical cancer screening are larger 3 years after the implementation of reform than in the year immediately following, suggesting that there may be an adjustment or learning period. Low-income women experience greater increases in breast and cervical cancer screening than the overall population; among women with household income less than 250% of the federal poverty level, mammograms increase by approximately 8% and Pap tests by 9%.

Psychosocial telephone counseling for survivors of cervical cancer: results of a randomized biobehavioral trial.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2015-02-23,"Survivors of cervical cancer experience quality-of-life (QOL) disruptions that persist years after treatment. This study examines the effect of a psychosocial telephone counseling (PTC) intervention on QOL domains and associations with biomarkers. We conducted a randomized clinical trial in survivors of cervical cancer, who were ≥ 9 and less than 30 months from diagnosis (n = 204), to compare PTC to usual care (UC). PTC included five weekly sessions and a 1-month booster. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and biospecimens were collected at baseline and 4 and 9 months after enrollment. Changes in PROs over time and associations with longitudinal change in cytokines as categorical variables were analyzed using multivariable analysis of variance for repeated measures. Participant mean age was 43 years; 40% of women were Hispanic, and 51% were non-Hispanic white. Adjusting for age and baseline scores, participants receiving PTC had significantly improved depression and improved gynecologic and cancer-specific concerns at 4 months compared with UC participants (all P < .05); significant differences in gynecologic and cancer-specific concerns (P < .05) were sustained at 9 months. Longitudinal change in overall QOL and anxiety did not reach statistical significance. Participants with decreasing interleukin (IL) -4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13 had significantly greater improvement in QOL than those with increasing cytokine levels.

A Markov decision tree based on the Gynecologic Oncology Group 240 randomized trial was created. The 2013 MediCare Services Drug Payment Table and Physician Fee Schedule provided costs. In the 5-year model subjects transitioned through the following states: response, progression, minor complications, severe complications, and death. Patients experiencing a health utility per month according to treatment effectiveness were calculated. Because cervical cancer survival is measured in months rather than years, results were reported in both quality adjusted cervical cancer life months and years (QALmonth, QALY), adjusted from a baseline of having advanced cervical cancer during a month. The estimated total cost of therapy with bevacizumab is approximately 13.2 times that for chemotherapy alone, adding $73,791 per 3.5months (0.29year) of life gained, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $21.083 per month of added life. The ICER increased to $5775 per month of added life and $24,597/QALmonth ($295,164/QALY) due to the smaller difference in QALmonths. With 75% bevacizumab cost reduction, the ICER is $6737/QALmonth ($80,844/QALY), which translates to $23,580 for the 3.5month (0.29year) gain in OS. Increased costs are primarily related to the cost of drug and not the management of bevacizumab-induced complications.

We included 102 cervical cancer patients treated with concurrent cisplatin (40 mg/m(2) /week) and pelvic radiotherapy treated at three US centres. No patient received granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or platelet transfusions. Using linear-mixed effects modelling, we analysed weekly reductions in log-transformed peripheral blood cell counts as a function of time (weeks), mean PBM dose and the PBM volume receiving ≥10 Gy (V(10)), 20 Gy (V(20)), 30 Gy (V(30)) and 40 Gy (V(40)). Increases in mean PBM radiation dose, V(20), V(30) and V(40) were all significantly associated with a greater weekly reduction in white blood cell (WBC) and absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs).

Patients underwent a hysterectomy and lymph node removal, and had ≥1 of the following high-risk factors: grade 3 carcinoma with >50% myometrial invasion, grade 2 or 3 disease with any cervical stromal invasion, or known extrauterine extension confined to the pelvis. Treatment included pelvic IMRT and concurrent cisplatin on days 1 and 29 of radiation and bevacizumab (at a dose of 5 mg/kg on days 1, 15, and 29 of radiation) followed by adjuvant carboplatin and paclitaxel for 4 cycles.

Aloe vera inhibits proliferation of human breast and cervical cancer cells and acts synergistically with cisplatin.,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,Asian Pac. J. Cancer Prev.,2015-01-01,"Many of the anti-cancer agents currently used have an origin in natural sources including plants. Aloe vera is one such plant being studied extensively for its diverse health benefits, including cancer prevention. In this study, the cytotoxic potential of Aloe vera crude extract (ACE) alone or in combination with cisplatin in human breast (MCF-7) and cervical (HeLa) cancer cells was studied by cell viability assay, nuclear morphological examination and cell cycle analysis. Effects were correlated with modulation of expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis and drug metabolism by RT-PCR. Exposure of cells to ACE resulted in considerable loss of cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, which was found to be mediated by through the apoptotic pathway as evidenced by changes in the nuclear morphology and the distribution of cells in the different phases of the cell cycle. Interestingly, ACE did not have any significant cytotoxicity towards normal cells, thus placing it in the category of safe chemopreventive agent. Further, the effects were correlated with the downregulation of cyclin D1, CYP 1A1, CYP 1A2 and increased expression of bax and p21 in MCF-7 and HeLa cells. In addition, low dose combination of ACE and cisplatin showed a combination index less than 1, indicating synergistic growth inhibition compared to the agents applied individually. In conclusion, these results signify that Aloe vera may be an effective anti-neoplastic agent to inhibit cancer cell growth and increase the therapeutic efficacy of conventional drugs like cispolatin. Thus promoting the development of plant-derived therapeutic agents appears warranted for novel cancer treatment strategies. ",Journal Article,1846.0,10.0,Many of the anti-cancer agents currently used have an origin in natural sources including plants Aloe vera is one such plant being studied extensively for its diverse health benefits including cancer prevention In this study the cytotoxic potential of Aloe vera crude extract ACE alone or in combination with cisplatin in human MCF-7 and HeLa cancer cells was studied by cell viability assay nuclear morphological examination and cell cycle analysis Effects were correlated with modulation of expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation apoptosis and drug metabolism by RT-PCR Exposure of cells to ACE resulted in considerable loss of cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent fashion which was found to be mediated by through the apoptotic pathway as evidenced by changes in the nuclear morphology and the distribution of cells in the different phases of the cell cycle Interestingly ACE did not have any significant cytotoxicity towards normal cells thus placing it in the category of safe chemopreventive agent Further the effects were correlated with the downregulation of cyclin D1 CYP 1A1 CYP 1A2 and increased expression of bax and p21 in MCF-7 and HeLa cells In addition low dose combination of ACE and cisplatin showed a combination index less than 1 indicating synergistic growth inhibition compared to the agents applied individually In conclusion these results signify that Aloe vera may be an effective anti-neoplastic agent to inhibit cancer cell growth and increase the therapeutic efficacy of conventional drugs like cispolatin Thus promoting the development of plant-derived therapeutic agents appears warranted for novel cancer treatment strategies,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[445, 1, 3, 312, 12, 183, 694, 95, 47, 35, 1938, 4, 1504, 3375, 141, 20406, 41057, 5756, 16, 104, 225, 9045, 486, 656, 3576, 9, 211, 1867, 341, 1141, 141, 12, 1070, 4, 26, 45, 3, 759, 174, 1, 41057, 5756, 6622, 7164, 11057, 279, 15, 4, 150, 5, 540, 4, 171, 3252, 67, 2, 8466, 12, 37, 10, 656, 20, 31, 2120, 719, 928, 4268, 1385, 2, 31, 417, 65, 176, 11, 438, 5, 2356, 1, 55, 1, 214, 646, 4, 31, 417, 863, 351, 2, 234, 1600, 20, 240, 604, 645, 1, 37, 6, 11057, 627, 4, 2658, 407, 1, 31, 2120, 4, 8, 61, 2, 98, 470, 3240, 92, 10, 204, 6, 40, 517, 20, 298, 3, 1631, 308, 22, 4728, 20, 400, 4, 3, 928, 2567, 2, 3, 1395, 1, 37, 4, 3, 338, 3523, 1, 3, 31, 417, 2873, 11057, 205, 44, 47, 500, 93, 1408, 3113, 295, 37, 631, 11815, 192, 4, 3, 2169, 1, 1165, 4401, 420, 195, 3, 176, 11, 438, 5, 3, 2475, 1, 1226, 2146, 9495, 18885, 9495, 30797, 2, 101, 55, 1, 3119, 2, 2657, 4, 3252, 67, 2, 8466, 37, 4, 352, 154, 61, 150, 1, 11057, 2, 540, 224, 8, 150, 558, 299, 76, 14, 1716, 1806, 129, 297, 72, 6, 3, 183, 1498, 4257, 4, 1221, 46, 99, 19016, 17, 41057, 5756, 68, 40, 35, 323, 312, 2000, 420, 6, 1433, 12, 31, 129, 2, 344, 3, 189, 209, 1, 809, 600, 733, 65925, 631, 2388, 3, 193, 1, 9045, 526, 189, 183, 1233, 1197, 9, 229, 12, 24, 422]",1679.0,25854386,411

The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of and factors associated with HPV vaccine initiation and completion among females surviving childhood cancer. One-hundred fourteen young adults and 230 mothers with daughters surviving childhood cancer completed surveys querying HPV vaccination history along with medical and sociodemographic factors potentially associated with vaccination outcomes. Vaccination rate differences by age necessitated analysis of outcomes by age group: 9-13 years (preadolescents), 14-17 years (adolescents), and 18-26 years (young adults). Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to identify factors associated with HPV vaccination outcomes. Overall, 34.6% (119/344) of survivors initiated and 20.9% (72/344) completed HPV vaccination. Preadolescents were least likely to have initiated vaccination (P < 0.001). Physician recommendation was associated with initiation across age groups (OR = 6.81-11.96, Ps < 0.001-.01), whereas older age at diagnosis (≥12 years of age) was associated with lower vaccination initiation among young adults only (OR = 0.28; 95%CI, 0.10-0.76, P = 0.012).

Association Study of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms of STAT2/STAT3/IFN-γ Genes in Cervical Cancer in Southern Chinese Han Women.,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,Asian Pac. J. Cancer Prev.,2015-01-01,"Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) each play an important role in carcinogenesis associated with viral infection. Cervical cancer is almost invariably associated with infection by human papillomavirus (HPV), and previous studies suggested that dysregulation of the signal pathway involved in IFN-γ and STATs is associated. Our objective was to evaluate the association of SNPs in STAT2, STAT3, and IFN-γ with cervical cancer susceptibility in Chinese Han women in Hunan province. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of 234 cervical cancer patients and 216 healthy female controls. STAT2 and STAT3 genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction enzyme (PCR-RE) analysis. IFN-γ genotyping was detected by PCR-amplification of specific allele (PASA). For STAT2 rs2066807 polymorphisms, there was no significant difference of genotype distribution (P=0.827) and allele frequencies (P=0.830, OR=1.09, 95% CI: 0.51-2.31) between cases and controls.

Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2015-06-01,"High-quality treatment for intact cervical cancer requires external radiation therapy, brachytherapy, and chemotherapy, carefully sequenced and completed without delays. We sought to determine how frequently current treatment meets quality benchmarks and whether new technologies have influenced patterns of care. By searching diagnosis and procedure claims in MarketScan, an employment-based health care claims database, we identified 1508 patients with nonmetastatic, intact cervical cancer treated from 1999 to 2011, who were <65 years of age and received >10 fractions of radiation. Treatments received were identified using procedure codes and compared with 3 quality benchmarks: receipt of brachytherapy, receipt of chemotherapy, and radiation treatment duration not exceeding 63 days. The Cochran-Armitage test was used to evaluate temporal trends. Seventy-eight percent of patients (n=1182) received brachytherapy, with brachytherapy receipt stable over time (Cochran-Armitage Ptrend=.15). Among patients who received brachytherapy, 66% had high-dose rate and 34% had low-dose rate treatment, although use of high-dose rate brachytherapy steadily increased to 75% by 2011 (Ptrend<.001). Eighteen percent of patients (n=278) received intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and IMRT receipt increased to 37% by 2011 (Ptrend<.001). Only 2.5% of patients (n=38) received IMRT in the setting of brachytherapy omission. Overall, 79% of patients (n=1185) received chemotherapy, and chemotherapy receipt increased to 84% by 2011 (Ptrend<.001). Median radiation treatment duration was 56 days (interquartile range, 47-65 days); however, duration exceeded 63 days in 36% of patients (n=543). Although 98% of patients received at least 1 benchmark treatment, only 44% received treatment that met all 3 benchmarks.

Oncol.,2015-06-17,"This video demonstrates our technique for a minimally invasive esophagectomy with side-to-side stapled cervical esophagogastric anastomosis. This technique is routinely utilized in most patients undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal or gastroesophageal junction malignancy, excluding type III gastroesophageal junction tumors. Absolute contraindications include significant tumor involvement of the fundus which may necessitate an intrathoracic anastomosis. Relative contraindications include poor pulmonary function or prior extensive surgical history that may either preclude surgery altogether or prevent the ability of the conduit from reaching the cervical region, or could preclude utilization of a minimally invasive approach. We have not found large body habitus to be an absolute contraindication for this approach. The technique involves thoracoscopic mobilization of the esophagus, laparoscopic dissection of the stomach and creation of gastric conduit, and creation of a 6 cm side-to-side stapled cervical esophagogastric anastomosis.

Radical trachelectomy in early-stage cervical cancer: A comparison of laparotomy and minimally invasive surgery.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2015-06-18,"Radical trachelectomy is considered standard of care in patients with early-stage cervical cancer interested in future fertility. The goal of this study was to compare operative, oncologic, and fertility outcomes in patients with early-stage cervical cancer undergoing open vs. minimally invasive radical trachelectomy. A retrospective review was performed of patients from four institutions who underwent radical trachelectomy for early-stage cervical cancer from June 2002 to July 2013. Perioperative, oncologic, and fertility outcomes were compared between patients undergoing open vs. minimally invasive surgery. A total of 100 patients were included in the analysis. Fifty-eight patients underwent open radical trachelectomy and 42 patients underwent minimally invasive surgery (MIS=laparoscopic or robotic). There were no differences in patient age, body mass index, race, histology, lymph vascular space invasion, or stage between the two groups. The median surgical time for MIS was 272min [range, 130-441min] compared with 270min [range, 150-373min] for open surgery (p=0.78). Blood loss was significantly lower for MIS vs. laparotomy (50mL [range, 10-225mL] vs. 300mL [50-1100mL]) (p<0.0001). Nine patients required blood transfusion, all in the open surgery group (p=0.010). Length of hospitalization was shorter for MIS than for laparotomy (1day [1-3 days] vs. 4days [1-9 days]) (p<0.0001). Three intraoperative complications occurred (3%): 1 bladder injury, and 1 fallopian tube injury requiring unilateral salpingectomy in the MIS group and 1 vascular injury in the open surgery group. The median lymph node count was 17 (range, 5-47) for MIS vs. 22 (range, 7-48) for open surgery (p=0.03). There were no differences in the rate of postoperative complications (30% MIS vs. 31% open surgery). Among 83 patients who preserved their fertility (33 MIS vs. 50 open surgery), 34 (41%) patients attempted to get pregnant. Sixteen (47%) patients were able to do so (MIS: 2 vs. laparotomy: 14, p=0.01). The pregnancy rate was higher in the open surgery group when compared to the MIS group (51% vs. 28%, p=0.018). However, median follow-up was shorter is the MIS group compared with the open surgery group (25months [range, 10-69] vs. 66months [range, 11-147]). To date, there has been one recurrence in the laparotomy group and none in the MIS group.

Clinical Outcomes of Computed Tomography-Based Volumetric Brachytherapy Planning for Cervical Cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2015-05-04,"A report of clinical outcomes of a computed tomography (CT)-based image guided brachytherapy (IGBT) technique for treatment of cervical cancer. Seventy-six women with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IB to IVA cervical carcinoma diagnosed between 2007 and 2014 were treated with definitive external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with or without concurrent chemotherapy followed by high-dose-rate (HDR) IGBT. All patients underwent planning CT simulation at each implantation. A high-risk clinical target volume (HRCTV) encompassing any visible tumor and the entire cervix was contoured on the simulation CT. When available, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at implantation to assist with tumor delineation. The prescription dose was prescribed to the HRCTV. The median follow-up time was 17 months. Thirteen patients (17%) had an MRI done before brachytherapy, and 16 patients (21%) were treated without MRI guidance. The mean EBRT/IGBT sum 2-Gy equivalent dose (EQD2) delivered to the 90% volume of the HRCTV was 86.3 Gy.

The American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) guideline content and recommendations were further reviewed by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Endorsement Panel. The ASCO Endorsement Panel determined that the recommendations from the ASTRO guideline are clear, thorough, and based on the most relevant scientific evidence. ASCO endorsed the ASTRO guideline with several qualifying statements. Surveillance without adjuvant radiation therapy is a reasonable option for women without residual disease in the hysterectomy specimen and for women with grade 1 or 2 cancer and < 50% myometrial invasion, especially when no other high-risk features are present. For women with grade 1 or 2 cancer and ≥ 50% myometrial invasion or grade 3 cancer and < 50% myometrial invasion, vaginal brachytherapy is as effective as pelvic radiation therapy at preventing vaginal recurrence and is preferred. Patients with grade 3 cancer and ≥ 50% myometrial invasion or cervical stroma invasion may benefit from pelvic radiation to prevent pelvic recurrence.

HIV Testing in Patients With Cancer at the Initiation of Therapy at a Large US Comprehensive Cancer Center.,Journal of oncology practice,J Oncol Pract,2015-08-04,"To determine the rates of HIV testing and infection among patients with cancer at initiation of systemic cancer therapy. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults with cancer who registered at a comprehensive cancer center from January 2004 through April 2011 and received systemic cancer therapy. We determined rates of HIV-1/2 and/or Western blot testing and HIV positivity at initiation of systemic cancer therapy. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine predictors of HIV testing. Of 18,874 patients with cancer who received systemic cancer therapy during the study period, 3,514 (18.6%) were tested for HIV at initiation of cancer therapy. The prevalence of positive HIV test results was 1.2% (41 of 3,514), and the prevalence of newly diagnosed HIV was 0.3% (12 of 3,514). The HIV testing rate was lower in black than in white patients (13.7% v 19.2%), but the prevalence of positive test results was higher in black patients (4.5%) than in any other racial/ethnic group. Among patients with AIDS-defining cancers (eg, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and cervical cancer), predictors of HIV testing were history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, younger age, and registration after 2006. Among patients with non-AIDS-defining cancers, predictors of HIV testing were younger age, registration after 2006, male sex, history of illicit drug use or sexually transmitted disease, having a hematologic malignancy, and black race.

Survivors of gynecologic malignancies: impact of treatment on health and well-being.,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,J Cancer Surviv,2015-08-06,"While overall survival from gynecologic malignancies has greatly improved over the last three decades, required treatments can lead to multiple health issues for survivors. Our objective was to identify health concerns that gynecologic cancer survivors face. A systematic, stratified sample of women with gynecologic malignancies was surveyed for 18 health issues occurring before, during, or after treatment. The impact of clinical features and treatment modality on health issues was assessed through multivariate logistic regression models. Of 2,546 surveys mailed, 622 were not received by eligible subjects secondary to invalid address, incorrect diagnosis, or death. Thus, 1924 survivors potentially received surveys. Of the 1,029 surveys (53.5%) completed, median age was 59 years; diagnoses included 29% cervical, 26% endometrial, 26% ovarian/primary peritoneal/fallopian tube, 12.1% vulvar, and 5.4% vaginal cancers. The most frequently reported health issues included fatigue (60.6%), sleep disturbance (54.9%), urinary difficulties (50.9%), sexual dysfunction (48.4%), neurologic issues (45.4%), bowel complaints (42.0%), depression (41.3%), and memory problems (41.2%). These rankings were consistent with patients' self-reported rankings of ""highest impact"" personal issues.

Barriers to health care contribute to delays in follow-up among women with abnormal cancer screening: Data from the Patient Navigation Research Program.,Cancer,Cancer,2015-08-19,"There is limited understanding of the association between barriers to care and clinical outcomes within patient navigation programs. Secondary analyses of data from the intervention arms of the Patient Navigation Research Program were performed, which included navigated participants with abnormal breast and cervical cancer screening tests from 2007 to 2010. Independent variables were: 1) the number of unique barriers to care (0, 1, 2, or ≥3) documented during patient navigation encounters; and 2) the presence of socio-legal barriers originating from social policy (yes/no). The median time to diagnostic resolution of index screening abnormalities was estimated using Kaplan-Meier cumulative incidence curves. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression examined the impact of barriers on time to resolution, controlling for sociodemographics and stratifying by study center. Among 2600 breast screening participants, approximately 75% had barriers to care documented (25% had 1 barrier, 16% had 2 barriers, and 34% had ≥3 barriers). Among 1387 cervical screening participants, greater than one-half had barriers documented (31% had 1 barrier, 11% had 2 barriers, and 13% had ≥3 barriers). Among breast screening participants, the presence of barriers was associated with less timely resolution for any number of barriers compared with no barriers. Among cervical screening participants, only the presence of ≥2 barriers was found to be associated with less timely resolution. Both types of barriers, socio-legal and other barriers, were found to be associated with delay among breast and cervical screening participants.

A total of 190,467 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 95,292 (50.0%) had breast cancer, 61,096 (32.1%) had prostate cancer, 28,194 (14.8%) had endometrial cancer, and 5885 (3.1%) had cervical cancer. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine the association between insurance status and receipt of brachytherapy among patients treated definitively for prostate and cervical cancer or postoperatively for breast and endometrial cancer. The rates of non-Medicaid insurance were 49.9% (cervical), 85.3% (endometrial), 87.4% (breast), and 90.9% (prostate) (P<.001). In a logistic regression, patients who received radiation therapy were less likely to receive brachytherapy if they had Medicaid coverage (odds ratio [OR] 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53-0.61, P<.001) or did not have insurance coverage (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.45-0.56, P<.001) compared with those with non-Medicaid insurance. On subset analysis, patients with Medicaid coverage or without insurance coverage were significantly less likely to receive brachytherapy than were those with non-Medicaid insurance for all 4 sites, except for patients with endometrial cancer.

Comparisons were made among women diagnosed at early stages of disease amendable to surgical treatment (≤IB1) and those diagnosed at a stage requiring local-regional or systemic/palliative treatment (≥IB2). Among the 138 women, 21.7% were diagnosed with ≤lB1 disease, while 78.3% were diagnosed with ≥IB2 disease. Late-stage diagnosis was associated with a greater number of emergency room (ER) visits (p<.001) and blood transfusions (p<.001) prior to diagnosis. Compared to 88% with ≤lB1 disease, only 53% of patients with ≥IB2 disease had a car (p=.003). Women with ≥IB2 disease were more likely to be without a primary care provider (75.0% vs. 42.3%, p=.001). Access to transportation and lack of a regular primary care provider or a medical home are associated with late-stage of CxCa at diagnosis.

"Glioblastoma Eradication Following Immune Checkpoint Blockade in an Orthotopic, Immunocompetent Model.",Cancer immunology research,Cancer Immunol Res,2015-11-06,"Inhibition of immune checkpoints, including cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), programmed death-1 (PD-1), and its ligand PD-L1, has demonstrated exciting and durable remissions across a spectrum of malignancies. Combinatorial regimens blocking complementary immune checkpoints further enhance the therapeutic benefit. The activity of these agents for patients with glioblastoma, a generally lethal primary brain tumor associated with significant systemic and microenvironmental immunosuppression, is not known. We therefore systematically evaluated the antitumor efficacy of murine antibodies targeting a broad panel of immune checkpoint molecules, including CTLA-4, PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 when administered as single-agent therapy and in combinatorial regimens against an orthotopic, immunocompetent murine glioblastoma model. In these experiments, we observed long-term tumor-free survival following single-agent anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-CTLA-4 therapy in 50%, 20%, and 15% of treated animals, respectively. Combination therapy of anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1 cured 75% of the animals, even against advanced, later-stage tumors. In long-term survivors, tumor growth was not seen upon intracranial tumor rechallenge, suggesting that tumor-specific immune memory responses were generated. Inhibitory immune checkpoint blockade quantitatively increased activated CD8(+) and natural killer cells and decreased suppressive immune cells in the tumor microenvironment and draining cervical lymph nodes.

In recognition of the pressing need for action, the GCIG convened an international meeting with expert representation from the GCIG groups and selected large sites in low- and middle-income countries. The focus was to develop a consensus on several concepts for future clinical trials, which would be developed and promoted by the GCIG and launched with major international participation. The first half of the meeting was devoted to a resume of the current state of the knowledge and identifying the gaps in need of new evidence, validating control arms for present and future clinical trials and identifying national and international barriers for studies of cervix cancers. The second half of the meeting was concerned with achieving consensus on a path forward. There were 5 principal outcomes as follows: first, a proposal to expand fertility-preserving options with neoadjuvant chemotherapy; second, validation of the assessment of sentinel lymph nodes using minimally invasive surgery with an emphasis on identification and management of low-volume metastasis, such as isolated tumor cells and micrometastasis; third, evaluation of hypofractionation for palliative and curative radiation under the umbrella of the GCIG Cervix Cancer Research Network; fourth, adding to the advances in antiangiogenesis therapy in the setting of metastatic disease; and fifth, developing a maintenance study among women at high risk of relapse.

Prevalence and predictors of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among young women surviving childhood cancer.,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,J Cancer Surviv,2015-11-16,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a sexually transmitted infection and the cause of cervical and other cancers. Vaccination is available to protect against genital HPV and is recommended for individuals aged 9-26 years. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of HPV vaccination among childhood cancer survivors and to identify factors associated with vaccine outcomes. Young adult females with (n = 114; M age = 21.18 years, SD = 2.48) and without (n = 98; M age = 20.65 years, SD = 2.29) a childhood cancer history completed surveys querying HPV vaccination initiation/completion, as well as sociodemographic, medical, and health belief factors. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for vaccine outcomes. Among survivors, 38.6 % (44/114) and 26.3 % (30/114) initiated or completed vaccination compared to 44.9 % (44/98) and 28.6 % (28/98) among controls, respectively. In the combined survivor/control group, physician recommendation (OR = 11.24, 95 % CI 3.15-40.14) and familial HPV communication (OR = 7.28, 95 % CI 1.89-28.05) associated with vaccine initiation. Perceptions of vaccine benefit associated with vaccine completion (OR = 10.55, 95 % CI 1.59-69.92), whereas perceptions of HPV-related severity associated with non-completion (OR = 0.14, 95 % CI 0.03-0.71).

Detection of HPV DNA in paraffin-embedded cervical samples: a comparison of four genotyping methods.,BMC infectious diseases,BMC Infect. Dis.,2015-11-25,"Identification of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in cervical tissue is important for understanding cervical carcinogenesis and for evaluating cervical cancer prevention approaches. However, HPV genotyping using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues is technically challenging. We evaluated the performance of four commonly used genotyping methods on FFPE cervical specimens conducted in different laboratories and compared to genotyping results from cytological samples. We included 60 pairs of exfoliated-cell and FFPE specimens from women with histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial lesions grade 2 or 3. Cytology specimens were genotyped using the Linear Array assay. Four expert laboratories processed tissue specimens using different preparation methods and then genotyped the resultant sample preparations using four different HPV genotyping methods: SPF10-PCR DEIA LiPA25 (version 1), Inno-LiPA, Linear Array and the Onclarity assay. Percentage agreement, kappa statistics and McNemar's chi-square were calculated for each comparison of different methods and specimen types. Overall agreement with respect to carcinogenic HPV status for FFPE samples between different methods was: 81.7, 86.7 and 91.7% for Onclarity versus Inno-LiPA, Linear Array and SPF-LiPA25, respectively; 81.7 and 85.0% for Linear Array versus Inno-LiPA and SPF-LiPA25, respectively; and 86.7% for SPF-LiPA25 versus Inno-LiPA. Type-specific agreement was >88.3% for all pair-wise comparisons. Comparisons with cytology specimens resulted in overall agreements from 80 to 95% depending on the method and type-specific agreement was >90% for most comparisons.

Impact of Patient Navigation Interventions on Timely Diagnostic Follow Up for Abnormal Cervical Screening.,Journal of women's health (2002),J Womens Health (Larchmt),2015-12-01,"As part of the Patient Navigation Research Program, we examined the effect of patient navigation versus usual care on timely diagnostic follow-up, defined as clinical management for women with cervical abnormalities within accepted time frames. Participants from four Patient Navigation Research Program centers were divided into low- and high-risk abnormality groups and analyzed separately. Low-risk participants (n = 2088) were those who enrolled with an initial Pap test finding of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) with a positive high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) serotype, atypical glandular cells, or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LGSIL). High-risk participants were those with an initial finding of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL) (n = 229). A dichotomous outcome of timely diagnostic follow-up within 180 days was used for the low-risk abnormality group and timely diagnostic follow-up within 60 days for the high-risk group, consistent with treatment guidelines. A logistic mixed-effects regression model was used to evaluate the intervention effect using a random effect for study arm within an institution. A backward selection process was used for multivariable model building, considering the impact of each predictor on the intervention effect. Low-risk women in the patient navigation arm showed an improvement in the odds of timely diagnostic follow-up across all racial groups, but statistically significant effects were only observed in non-English-speaking Hispanics (OR 5.88, 95% CI 2.81-12.29). No effect was observed among high-risk women.

High-resolution microendoscopy: a point-of-care diagnostic for cervical dysplasia in low-resource settings.,European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP),Eur. J. Cancer Prev.,2017-01-01,"Cervical cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related death among women in low-to-middle income countries. Pap testing and pathological services are difficult to implement under these settings. Alternative techniques for the diagnosis of cervical precancer in these settings are needed to reduce the burden of the disease. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a low-cost, high-resolution microendoscope imaging system in identifying precancerous lesions of the cervix in vivo. A retrospective study of 59 patients undergoing colposcopy for an abnormal Pap test was performed at Hospital de Câncer de Barretos in Brazil. All patients underwent colposcopy as per standard of care, and acetowhite lesions were recorded. High-resolution microendoscopy (HRME) images were obtained from one colposcopically normal region and from all lesions observed on colposcopy. Biopsies of abnormal areas were obtained and reviewed by three independent, blinded pathologists and compared with HRME findings. The mean nuclear area and the median nuclear eccentricity were calculated from HRME images acquired from each site. A diagnostic algorithm to distinguish histopathologically diagnosed cervical intraepithelial neoplasias of grade 2 or more severe lesions (high grade) from less severe lesions (low grade) was developed using these parameters. A test of trend was used to analyze the relationship between HRME positivity and severity of histopathogical diagnosis. Fisher's exact test was used to analyze differences in HRME positivity between high-grade and low-grade lesions. Evaluable images were obtained from 108 of 143 discrete sites. Of these, 71 sites were colposcopically normal or low grade according to histopathology and 37 were diagnosed as high grade on the basis of histopathology. Using the mean nuclear area and the median nuclear eccentricity, HRME images from 59 colposcopically abnormal sites were classified as high grade or low grade with 92% sensitivity and 77% specificity compared with histopathological findings. Increasing HRME positivity showed a significant trend with increasing severity of diagnosis (Ptrend<0.001).

Cancer,2016-01-01,"The aim of the study was to describe pregnancy risk assessment, reproductive goals, and incidence of pregnancy among the reproductive age population seen by gynecologic oncologists at a tertiary care center. A retrospective chart review was conducted among 18- to 45-year-old women evaluated by a gynecologic oncologist from January 2000 to December 2011. Data abstracted included the following: diagnosis, cancer treatment, parity, pregnancy risk factors (eg, menstrual patterns, sexual activity, and use of contraception), reproductive goals, type of referral, and pregnancy. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the characteristics of the population. Five hundred seventeen women were eligible and included in the review. Median age was 31 years with most common diagnoses being cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, and premalignant disease. Most patients are multiparous. Seventy percent were treated surgically, with 58% experiencing surgical sterility. Completeness of reproductive data documented at initial visit included the following: 47% with a contraception plan, 54% sexual activity/practices, and 37% with personal reproductive goals reviewed. Fifteen patients were pregnant at the initial visit, and 21 patients pregnant during follow-up, representing 43 pregnancies (9 patients had more than 1 pregnancy). For those maintaining fertility after the initial visit, there was a median (range) of 2 (0-25) visits with 32% documenting a contraception plan at follow-up visits. A patient's reproductive goals and risk factors for pregnancy are inconsistently addressed during initial consultation with the gynecologic oncologist. This lack of consistency potentially increases patients' risk for unplanned pregnancy during evaluation and treatment of a gynecologic cancer diagnosis and potentially results in a missed opportunity for fertility preservation.

Cancer Res.,2015-12-01,"In the randomized phase III trial, Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) protocol 240, the incorporation of bevacizumab with chemotherapy significantly increased overall survival (OS) in women with advanced cervical cancer. A major objective of GOG-240 was to prospectively analyze previously identified pooled clinical prognostic factors known as the Moore criteria. Potential negative factors included black race, performance status 1, pelvic disease, prior cisplatin, and progression-free interval <365 days. Risk categories included low-risk (0-1 factor), mid-risk (2-3 factors), and high-risk (4-5 factors). Each test of association was conducted at the 5% level of significance. Logistic regression and survival analysis was used to determine whether factors were prognostic or could be used to guide therapy. For the entire population (n = 452), high-risk patients had significantly worse OS (P < 0.0001). The HRs of death for treating with topotecan in low-risk, mid-risk, and high-risk subsets are 1.18 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.63-2.24], 1.11 (95% CI, 0.82-1.5), and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.50-1.42), respectively. The HRs of death for treating with bevacizumab in low-risk, mid-risk, and high-risk subsets are 0.96 (95% CI, 0.51-1.83; P = 0.9087), 0.673 (95% CI, 0.5-0.91; P = 0.0094), and 0.536 (95% CI, 0.32-0.905; P = 0.0196), respectively. This is the first prospectively validated scoring system in cervical cancer. The Moore criteria have real-world clinical applicability. Toxicity concerns may justify omission of bevacizumab in some low-risk patients where survival benefit is small. The benefit to receiving bevacizumab appears to be greatest in the moderate- and high-risk subgroups (5.8-month increase in median OS).

When to Treat Adults Like Children: Optimizing Therapy for Lymphoblastic Lymphoma in Young Adults.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2015-12-23,"A 23-year-old man was urgently referred for evaluation of rapidly enlarging cervical lymphadenopathy, progressive dyspnea, fatigue, night sweats, and an unintentional weight loss of 25 pounds. A computed tomography scan of the neck performed 30 days before referral revealed bilateral cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy (6 × 5 cm). A fine-needle aspirate of nasopharyngeal tissue demonstrated fibroadipose tissue. Tissue collected by core needle biopsy of a left internal jugular lymph node demonstrated a reactive lymph node but no malignancy. The patient was admitted to an academic medical center hospital. His physical examination was remarkable for bulky cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. A testicular examination was normal. The patient's lactate dehydrogenase concentration was 327 U/L (normal range, 118-225 U/L). A positron emission tomography scan revealed bilateral cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy (6 × 5 cm with a standardized uptake value [SUV] of 14), a 1.3-cm subcutaneous nodule in the left thigh (SUV 16), and two 2.7-cm liver lesions (SUV 14). He underwent an excisional lymph node biopsy. The lymph node revealed effacement of the architecture by an interfollicular infiltrate of lymphoid cells (Fig 1). Mitotic figures were abundant (Ki-67 stain 80% to 90% positive) and there were multiple foci of tissue necrosis. The lymphoblasts were examined by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry and expressed the T-cell markers CD2, CD3, CD4, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. A subpopulation of T cells was positive for both CD4 and CD8. Polymerase chain reaction studies revealed a clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor γ gene. A marrow aspirate and biopsy revealed normal trilineage hematopoiesis with no evidence of lymphoma and a normal male karyotype (46, XY). A lumbar puncture sample did not contain lymphoma cells.

Dying well: How equal is end of life care among gynecologic oncology patients?,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2015-12-17,"To identify disparities in utilization of end of life (EoL) resources by gynecologic oncology (GO) patients. This retrospective analysis of the medical records of GO patients treated 1/2007-12/2011 and deceased 1/2012-8/2014 evaluated patient demographics, disease characteristics, and utilization of EoL resources. Chi-square, Fisher's exact test, Mann Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for statistical analysis. Of 189 patients analyzed, 113 (60%) were white, 38 (20%) Hispanic, 31 (16%) black, and seven (4%) Asian. Ninety-five (48%) had ovarian cancer, 51 (26%) uterine, 47 (23%) cervical, seven (3%) vulvar/vaginal. In the last 30days of life (DoL), 18 (10%) had multiple hospital admissions, 10 (5%) admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), 30 (16%) multiple Emergency Room (ER) visits, 45 (24%) received aggressive medical care and eight (4%) received chemotherapy in the final 14 DoL. Furthermore, 54 (29%) had no Supportive Care referral and 29 (15%) no hospice referral. Only 46 (24%) had a Medical Power of Attorney (PoA) or Living Will (LW) on file. Non-white race was associated with increased odds of dying without hospice (OR 3.07; 95%CI [1.27, 2.46], p=0.013). However, non-white patients who enrolled in hospice did so earlier than white patients (42 v. 27days before death, p=0.054).

Impact of Widespread Cervical Cancer Screening: Number of Cancers Prevented and Changes in Race-specific Incidence.,American journal of clinical oncology,Am. J. Clin. Oncol.,2018-03-01,"With recent approval of standalone HPV testing and increasing uptake of HPV vaccination, some have postulated that we are moving toward a ""post-Pap"" era of cervical cancer prevention. However, the total number cases that have been prevented by Pap smear screening as well as its impact on racial disparities are unknown. We estimated national cervical cancer incidence from 1976 to 2009 using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result database. Screening data were obtained from the literature and National Cancer Institute Progress Reports. We examined early, late, and race-specific trends in cancer incidence, and calculated the estimated number of cancers prevented over the past 3 decades. From 1976 to 2009, there was a significant decrease in the incidence of early-stage cervical cancer, from 9.8 to 4.9 cases per 100,000 women (P<0.001). Late-stage disease incidence also decreased, from 5.3 to 3.7 cases per 100,000 women (P<0.001). The incidence among black women decreased from 26.9 to 9.7 cases per 100,000 women (P<0.001), a greater decline compared with that of white women and women of other races. After adjusting for ""prescreening era"" rates of cervical cancer, we estimate that Pap smears were associated with a reduction of between 105,000 and 492,000 cases of cervical cancer over the past 3 decades in the United States.

Patients with endometrial cancer of all histologies clinically involving the cervix or parametria treated with neoadjuvant brachytherapy followed by extrafascial hysterectomy from 1999 to 2014 were identified. Patient charts were reviewed for data regarding treatment characteristics and postoperative outcomes. Pearson χ and logistic regression analyses were used to assess correlations between surgical complications and treatment-related variables. Twenty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. Mean operating time for the cohort was 115 minutes. Mean estimated blood loss was 100 mL. No visceral injuries occurred. Mean length of hospital stay was 1 and 4 days for the minimally invasive and laparotomy groups, respectively. Rates of postoperative ileus, blood transfusion, wound infection, and readmission were 3%, 3%, 6%, and 3%, respectively. No case of prolonged urodynamic dysfunction was noted. The rate of vaginal complications was significantly higher in the group of patients who underwent minimally invasive surgery as compared with laparotomy (33% vs 5%, P < 0.041).

Phase I Study of PSMA-Targeted Docetaxel-Containing Nanoparticle BIND-014 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2016-02-04,"First-in-human phase I trial to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of BIND-014, a novel, tumor prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted nanoparticle, containing docetaxel. Patients with advanced solid tumors received BIND-014 every three weeks (n = 28) or weekly (n = 27), with dose levels ranging from 3.5 to 75 mg/m(2) and 15 to 45 mg/m(2), respectively. BIND-014 was generally well tolerated, with no unexpected toxicities. The most common drug-related toxicities (>20% of patients) on either schedule included neutropenia, fatigue, anemia, alopecia, and diarrhea. BIND-014 demonstrated a dose-linear pharmacokinetic profile, distinct from docetaxel, with prolonged persistence of docetaxel-encapsulated circulating nanoparticles. Of the 52 patients evaluable for response, one had a complete response (cervical cancer on the every three week schedule) and five had partial responses (ampullary adenocarcinoma, non-small cell lung, and prostate cancers on the every-three-week schedule, and breast and gastroesophageal cancers on the weekly schedule). Responses were noted in both PSMA-detectable and -undetectable tumors.

Stage I and II Endometrial Adenocarcinoma: Analysis of 2009 FIGO Staging Revision and Impact on Survival by Adjuvant Therapy.,American journal of clinical oncology,Am. J. Clin. Oncol.,2018-03-01,"In 2009, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics revised the staging classification for endometrial cancer. Mucosal cervical involvement was eliminated from the criteria and only those with stromal cervical involvement were considered stage II. We examined the implications of the staging changes and the survival impact of adjuvant therapy in stage I to II endometrial adenocarcinoma. Data were obtained from the National Oncology Data Alliance. Stage I to II endometrial adenocarcinoma patients diagnosed between 1988 and 2008 were identified and grouped according to the 1988 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging. Multivariate analysis (MVA) was performed using proportional hazards model; comparison of Kaplan-Meier survival curves was based on the log-rank statistic. A total of 14,158 patients with stage I to II endometrial adenocarcinoma were identified with a median follow-up of 41 months. Adjuvant external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and adjuvant vaginal brachytherapy (VB) were positive predictors for overall survival (OS) only in IC, IIA, and IIB. On MVA, stages IA and IB OS did not differ (P=0.17), IIA had worse OS compared with IC (P<0.05), and IIA OS did not differ from IIB (P=0.57). Neither IA nor IB benefited from adjuvant radiotherapy on MVA. However, both IC and IIA had OS improvements with VB±EBRT (P<0.05) with the greatest impact from the VB.

The cost-utility of integrated cervical cancer prevention strategies in the Ontario setting - Can we do better?,Vaccine,Vaccine,2016-02-15,"A universal, publicly funded, school-based human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination program in grade eight girls was initiated in Ontario in 2007. We present a cost-utility analysis of integrated cervical cancer prevention programs from the healthcare payer perspective. Our analysis was based on linked HPV transmission and disease history models. We obtained data from the literature, provincial surveys and Ontario population-based linked health administrative datasets. We modeled combinations of vaccination and screening strategies. We considered vaccination based on the Ontario experience, as well as conservative and optimistic scenarios, varying coverage, vaccine effectiveness and duration of protection. We considered 900 screening scenarios (screening start age: 21-70 years, screening interval: 3-20 years; 1-year time steps). The current schedule screens every 3 years starting at age 21 years. We examined (1) first vaccinated cohort (low herd-immunity), and (2) steady state, i.e. all cohorts were vaccinated (high herd-immunity). Adding vaccination to the current screening schedule was cost-effective (<C$10,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY)) across all scenarios. Delaying screening start and/or extending screening intervals increased both expected QALYs and cost, and increased overall NHB for screening schedules with a start age of 25-35 years and 3-10-year intervals for most scenarios. Delaying screening start age and/or extending screening intervals in vaccinated cohorts is likely to be cost-effective.

We reviewed robotic cases undergoing SLN mapping with a cervical injection from January 2011 to December 2013 using either blue dye or ICG with near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging. Data were stratified by body mass index (BMI) and the dye used. Appropriate statistical tests were applied. Overall, 472 cases were identified. Bilateral mapping was successful in 352 cases (75 %), and unilateral mapping was successful in 73 cases (15 %). Bilateral mapping was achieved in 266 (85 %) of 312 ICG cases compared with 86 (54 %) of 160 blue-dye cases (p < 0.001). Cases with successful bilateral mapping had a median BMI of 29.8 kg/m(2) (range 16.3-65.3 kg/m(2)); cases with no mapping had a median BMI of 34.7 kg/m(2) (range 21.4-60.4 kg/m(2)) (p = 0.001).

We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using probes targeting CD274, PDCD1LG2, and the centromeric portion of chromosome 9, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using an antibody recognizing PD-L1 on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsy specimens from 48 cervical SCCs and 23 vulvar SCCs. Tumors were categorized according to the genetic abnormality in CD274 and PDCD1LG2 (coamplification > cogain > polysomy > disomy) as detected by FISH, and evaluated on a semiquantitative scale (modified H score, the product of the percentage of tumor cells with positive staining and the maximum intensity of positive staining) for PD-L1 protein expression as detected by IHC. Overall, 71 samples of FFPE tissue from cases of cervical SCCs (n = 48) and vulvar SCCs (n = 23) were retrieved from the archives of Brigham and Women's Hospital and included in this study. We observed cogain or coamplification of CD274 and PDCD1LG2 in 32 of 48 cervical SCCs (67%) and 10 of 23 vulvar SCCs (43%). Median PD-L1 protein expression was highest among tumors with CD274 and PDCD1LG2 coamplification and lowest among tumors with disomy. Recurrent copy number gain of the genes encoding the PD-1 ligands provides a genetic basis for PD-L1 expression in a subset of cervical and vulvar SCCs and identifies a class of patients that are rational candidates for therapies targeting PD-1.",Journal Article,1390.0,59.0,Patients with squamous cell carcinoma SCC of the cervix or vulva have limited therapeutic options and the potential for immunotherapy for this population has not been evaluated Recent trials suggest that tumors with a genetic basis for PD-1 programmed cell death protein 1 ligand expression are highly sensitive to therapeutic antibodies targeting PD-1 To determine the genetic status of CD274 encoding PD-L1 programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 and PDCD1LG2 encoding PD-L2 programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 in SCCs of the cervix and vulva and to correlate the findings with PD-L1 protein expression We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH using probes targeting CD274 PDCD1LG2 and the centromeric portion of chromosome 9 and immunohistochemistry IHC using an antibody recognizing PD-L1 on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded FFPE biopsy specimens from 48 SCCs and 23 SCCs Tumors were categorized according to the genetic abnormality in CD274 and PDCD1LG2 coamplification cogain polysomy disomy as detected by FISH and evaluated on a semiquantitative scale modified H score the product of the percentage of tumor cells with positive staining and the maximum intensity of positive staining for PD-L1 protein expression as detected by IHC Overall 71 samples of FFPE tissue from cases of SCCs n 48 and SCCs n 23 were retrieved from the archives of Brigham and Women 's Hospital and included in this study We observed cogain or coamplification of CD274 and PDCD1LG2 in 32 of 48 SCCs 67 and 10 of 23 SCCs 43 Median PD-L1 protein expression was highest among tumors with CD274 and PDCD1LG2 coamplification and lowest among tumors with disomy Recurrent copy number gain of the genes encoding the PD-1 ligands provides a genetic basis for PD-L1 expression in a subset of and SCCs and identifies a class of patients that are rational candidates for therapies targeting PD-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[7, 5, 691, 31, 134, 1791, 1, 3, 3629, 15, 9263, 47, 383, 189, 838, 2, 3, 174, 9, 726, 9, 26, 266, 71, 44, 85, 194, 435, 143, 309, 17, 57, 5, 8, 336, 877, 9, 333, 14, 1846, 31, 273, 178, 14, 1232, 55, 32, 561, 745, 6, 189, 890, 529, 333, 14, 6, 223, 3, 336, 156, 1, 10511, 2362, 333, 729, 1846, 31, 273, 14, 1232, 14, 2, 14047, 2362, 333, 5111, 1846, 31, 273, 14, 1232, 18, 4, 6334, 1, 3, 3629, 2, 9263, 2, 6, 1513, 3, 272, 5, 333, 729, 178, 55, 21, 173, 1591, 4, 957, 1554, 1277, 75, 3701, 529, 10511, 14047, 2, 3, 15531, 3206, 1, 1170, 83, 2, 888, 1289, 75, 35, 548, 5842, 333, 729, 23, 3265, 1959, 2487, 2505, 4412, 411, 623, 29, 576, 6334, 2, 382, 6334, 57, 11, 2320, 768, 6, 3, 336, 3698, 4, 10511, 2, 14047, 17912, 49585, 5882, 13983, 22, 530, 20, 1277, 2, 194, 23, 8, 8942, 1124, 1230, 555, 368, 3, 2821, 1, 3, 1150, 1, 30, 37, 5, 109, 1029, 2, 3, 689, 837, 1, 109, 1029, 9, 333, 729, 178, 55, 22, 530, 20, 1289, 63, 792, 347, 1, 4412, 246, 29, 140, 1, 6334, 78, 576, 2, 6334, 78, 382, 11, 4539, 29, 3, 12810, 1, 10543, 2, 117, 292, 702, 2, 159, 4, 26, 45, 21, 164, 49585, 15, 17912, 1, 10511, 2, 14047, 4, 531, 1, 576, 6334, 598, 2, 79, 1, 382, 6334, 601, 52, 333, 729, 178, 55, 10, 1076, 107, 57, 5, 10511, 2, 14047, 17912, 2, 2101, 107, 57, 5, 13983, 387, 1337, 207, 1803, 1, 3, 214, 2362, 3, 333, 14, 3123, 777, 8, 336, 877, 9, 333, 729, 55, 4, 8, 697, 1, 2, 6334, 2, 2953, 8, 1040, 1, 7, 17, 32, 2696, 1931, 9, 235, 529, 333, 14]",1869.0,26913631,313
Health Behaviors in Cervical Cancer Survivors and Associations with Quality of Life.,Clinical therapeutics,Clin Ther,2016-02-27,"Improvement in health behaviors following cancer diagnosis may contribute to better prognosis and well-being. This study examines the prevalence of health behaviors in cervical cancer survivors who have completed treatment, and associations between health behaviors and quality of life (QOL). We recruited 204 women who had completed treatment for cervical cancer to participate in a randomized counseling intervention. Participants provided information on health behaviors (smoking, physical activity, and alcohol consumption); QOL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cervical questionnaire); and depression (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System), anxiety (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System), and distress (Brief Symptom Inventory) at baseline (9-30 months after diagnosis) and subsequent to the intervention. Data were analyzed using multivariate general linear models. Participants ranged in age from 20 to 72 years at diagnosis (mean = 43 years), 41% were Hispanic, and 52% were non-Hispanic white. Three-fourths were stage 1 at diagnosis and 51% were treated with radiation with or without chemotherapy. At baseline, 15% of patients were current smokers, 4% reported alcohol consumption of >10 drinks per week, and 63% reported exercising <3 hours per week. Overall, 67.4% of cervical cancer survivors did not meet recommended national guidelines for at least 1 of these health behaviors. QOL scores were significantly higher for patients with greater physical activity (128 vs 118; P = 0.002) and increased with the number of recommended guidelines met (P for trend = 0.030). Associations between patient-reported outcomes and smoking and alcohol consumption did not reach statistical significance. Participants who met guidelines for all health behaviors also had less depression (P = 0.008), anxiety (P = 0.051), and distress (P = 0.142). Participants who improved their aggregate health behaviors during the 4-month follow-up experienced a greater improvement in QOL than those who did not improve their health behaviors (10.8 vs 4.5; P = 0.026). Results indicate that two-thirds of cervical cancer survivors are not meeting national guidelines for smoking, physical activity, and alcohol consumption following completion of definitive treatment. These adverse health behaviors were associated with impaired QOL and higher levels of depression and distress.

"Next-Generation Sequencing-Based HPV Genotyping Assay Validated in Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded Oropharyngeal and Cervical Cancer Specimens.",Journal of biomolecular techniques : JBT,J Biomol Tech,2016-03-07,"Available clinical human papilloma virus (HPV) diagnostics for head and neck cancer have limited sensitivity and/or fail to define the HPV genotype. Common HPV genotyping assays are costly and labor intensive. We sought to develop a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based HPV genotyping assay that was sensitive enough to work on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. We developed an ion torrent NGS HPV genotyping assay using barcoded HPV PCR broad-spectrum general primers 5(+)/6(+) (BSGP)5(+)/6(+). To validate genotype specificity and use in archived clinical FFPE tumor samples, we compared NGS HPV genotyping at 2 sequencing centers with typing by Roche Linear Array assay in 42 oropharyngeal and cervical cancer specimens representing 10 HPV genotypes, as well as HPV-negative cases. To demonstrate the detection of a broad range of HPV genotypes, we genotyped a cohort of 266 cervical cancers. A comparison of NGS genotyping of FFPE cancer specimens with genotyping by Linear Array showed concordant results in 34/37 samples (92%) at sequencing site 1 and 39/42 samples (93%) at sequencing site 2.

Disparities in the management and outcome of cervical cancer in the United States according to health insurance status.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2016-03-25,"Our study sought to characterize the presentation, local management and outcomes of invasive cervical cancer with regard to patient insurance status. We queried the NCI-SEER database for invasive cervical cancer cases in patients aged 18-64 from 2007 to 2011. We analyzed clinical and socioeconomic data with regard insurance status (insured, Medicaid, or uninsured). We tested for associations between patient insurance status and treatment with definitive surgery for FIGO IA2-IB1 patients, and treatment with suboptimal radiation therapy (RT) for FIGO IB2-IVA patients (other than combination external beam and brachytherapy). We evaluated overall and cause specific survival according to insurance status. 11,714 cases were analyzed: 60% insured, 31% Medicaid, and 9% uninsured. FIGO III/IV stage at presentation was more frequent with Medicaid (40%) and uninsured (42%) compared to insured patients (28%) (p<0.001). For FIGO IA2-IB1 patients, receipt of definitive surgery was inversely associated with uninsured status (OR [95%CI]=0.65 [0.47-0.90], p<0.001) in univariable analysis; however the relationship lost significance after multivariable adjustment. For FIGO IB2-IVA patients, the use of suboptimal RT was associated with uninsured status (OR [95%CI]=1.33 [1.07-1.65], p=0.011) in adjusted analyses. Among all patients, overall mortality was increased with Medicaid (HR [95%CI]=1.16 [1.05-1.28], p=0.003) and uninsured status (HR [95%CI]=1.17 [1.01-1.34], p=0.031) in multivariable analysis. Cancer specific mortality survival trended towards significance in multivariable analyses for both Medicaid (HR [95%CI]=1.11 [1.00-1.24] and uninsured status (HR [95%CI]=1.14 [0.98-1.33]).

Comparison of Colposcopic Impression Based on Live Colposcopy and Evaluation of Static Digital Images.,Journal of lower genital tract disease,J Low Genit Tract Dis,2016-04-01,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the agreement and compare diagnostic accuracy of colposcopic impressions from live colposcopy versus evaluation of static digital images. Live impressions and corresponding static images obtained during colposcopy of 690 women were independently compared. Diagnostic accuracy was calculated for colposcopic impressions from both methods, varying hypothetical thresholds for colposcopically directed cervical biopsies (acetowhitening or worse, low grade or worse, high grade or worse). Stratified analyses investigated the impact of referral cytology, human papillomavirus 16 infection, and age on colposcopic impression. Overall agreement between live and static colposcopic visualization was 43.0% (κ = 0.20; 95% CI = 0.14-0.26) over normal, acetowhitening, low-grade, and high-grade impressions. Classification of acetowhitening or worse impressions showed the highest agreement (92.2%; κ = 0.39; 95% CI = 0.21-0.57); both methods achieved more than 95% sensitivity for CIN 2+. Agreement between live and static colposcopic visualization was 69.3% for rating low-grade or worse impressions (κ = 0.23; 95% CI = 0.14-0.33) and 71% when rating high-grade impressions (κ = 0.33; 95% CI = 0.24-0.42). Live colposcopic impressions were more likely to be rated low grade or worse (p < .01; odds ratio = 3.5; 95% CI = 2.4-5.0), yielding higher sensitivity for CIN 2+ at this threshold than static image assessment (95.4% vs 79.8%, p < .01). Overall, colposcopic impressions were more likely rated high grade on live assessment among women referred with high-grade cytology (odds ratio = 3.3; 95% CI = 1.8-6.4), significantly improving the sensitivity for CIN 2+ (66.3% vs 48.5%, p < .01).

Initiation of a formalized precision medicine program in gynecologic oncology.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2016-04-01,"In an effort to better incorporate precision medicine into clinical practice, we initiated a pilot project to screen, discuss, and genetically characterize patients with metastatic or recurrent gynecologic malignancies for whom no curative standard of care exists. In 7/2014, we initiated a multi-disciplinary Precision Medicine Board (PMB) whose purpose was to apply molecular profiling to select and prioritize early phase clinical trial enrollment for high-risk gynecologic malignancies. Additional objectives were to record outcomes and enable scientific discussions of mutations which may foster local translational research. FoundationOne was the preferred genomic platform; results were reviewed by a team comprised of disease site specialists, phase I trialists, and basic and translational scientists affiliated with the Gynecologic Cancer Program. A detailed database for each patient was created and is followed prospectively for treatment use and resultant outcomes. To date, we have presented 62 cases with interpretable FoundationOne testing on 60 tumor samples (31 ovarian, 18 uterine, 9 cervical, and 4 other female genital tract). Significant genomic alterations were commonly found in all tumor types (median: 3); TP53 (45%) and PIK3CA (27%) were the most frequently noted mutations; however, molecular profiling resulted in identification of few actionable mutations (6%). To date, we have matched 4 patients on therapies based on actionable mutations.

Preoperative catheter spinal angiography and embolization of cervical spinal tumors: Outcomes from a single center.,"Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",Interv Neuroradiol,2016-03-27,"The existing literature regarding preoperative cervical spinal tumor embolization is sparse, with few discussions on the indications, risks, and best techniques. We present our experience with the preoperative endovascular management of hypervascular cervical spinal tumors. We performed a retrospective review of all patients who underwent preoperative spinal angiography (regardless of whether tumor embolization was performed) at our institution (from 2002 to 2012) for primary and metastatic cervical spinal tumors. Tumor vascularity was graded from 0 (tumor blush equal to the normal adjacent vertebral body) to 3 (intense tumor blush with arteriovenous shunting). Tumors were considered ""hypervascular"" if they had a tumor vascular grade from 1 to 3. Embolic materials included particles, liquid embolics, and detachable coils. The main embolization technique was superselective catheterization of an arterial tumor feeder followed by injection of embolic material. This technique could be used alone or supplemented with occlusion of dangerous anastomoses of the vertebral artery as needed to prevent inadvertent embolization of the vertebrobasilar system. In cases when superselective catheterization of the tumoral feeder was not feasible, embolization was performed from a proximal catheter position after occlusion of branches supplying areas other than the tumor (""flow diversion""). A total of 47 patients with 49 cervical spinal tumors were included in this study. Of the 49 total tumors, 41 demonstrated increased vascularity (vascularity score > 0). The most common tumor pathology in our series was renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (N = 16; 32.7% of all tumors) followed by thyroid carcinoma (N = 7; 14.3% of all tumors).Tumor embolization was undertaken in 25 hypervascular tumors resulting in complete, near-complete, and partial embolization in 36.0% (N = 9), 44.0% (N = 11), and 20.0% (N = 5) of embolized tumors, respectively. We embolized 42 tumor feeders in 25 tumors. The most commonly embolized tumor feeders were branches of the vertebral artery (19.0%; N = 8), the deep cervical artery (19.0%; N = 8), and the ascending cervical artery (19.0%; N = 8). Sixteen hypervascular tumors were not embolized because of minimal hypervascularity (8/16), unacceptably high risk of spinal cord or vertebrobasilar ischemia (4/16), failed superselective catheterization of tumor feeder (3/16), and cancellation of surgery (1/16). Vertebral artery occlusion was performed in 20% of embolizations. There were no new post-procedure neurological deficits or any serious adverse events. Estimated blood loss data from this cohort show a significant decrease in operative blood loss for embolized tumors of moderate and significant hypervascularity.

Sequencing of mutational hotspots in cancer-related genes in small cell neuroendocrine cervical cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2016-04-15,"Small cell cervical cancer is a rare malignancy with limited treatment options for recurrent disease. We sought to determine if tumor specimens of small cell cervical cancer harbor common somatic mutations and if any of these are actionable. Using a registry of patients with neuroendocrine cervical cancer, we identified 44 patients with pure or mixed small cell cervical cancer who had undergone mutational analysis. Mutations had been detected using next generation sequencing of mutational hotspots in 50 cancer-related genes. Thirty-five mutations were identified in 24 patients (55%). Fifteen of these 24 patients (63%) had 1 mutation, 7 patients (29%) had 2 mutations, and 2 patients (8%) had 3 mutations. In all 44 patients, the most commonly seen mutations were mutations in PIK3CA (8 patients; 18%), KRAS (6 patients; 14%), and TP53 (5 patients; 11%). No other mutation was found in >7% of specimens. Of the 24 patients who had a mutation, 21 (88%) had at least 1 alteration for which there currently exists a class of biological agents targeting that mutation. In the entire cohort of 44 patients, 48% had at least 1 actionable mutation. Although no single mutation was found in the majority of patients with small cell cervical cancer, almost half had at least 1 actionable mutation.

Programmable protein arrays for immunoprofiling HPV-associated cancers.,Proteomics,Proteomics,2016-04-04,"Over 600,000 cancers each year are attributed to the human papillomavirus (HPV), including cervical, anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers (OPC). A key challenge in understanding HPV immunobiology is the diversity of oncogenic HPV types and the need for multiplexed display of HPV antigens to measure antibody responses. We have generated custom HPV protein microarrays displaying 98 proteins as C-terminal GST fusion proteins, representing eight antigens of two low-risk HPV types (HPV6 and 11) and ten oncogenic high-risk HPV types (HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52 and 58). We demonstrate robust and reproducible protein expression of 96/98 of the antigens using a human cell lysate expression system. The target epitopes and specificities of four monoclonal antibodies were identified.

Adjuvant radiotherapy versus concurrent chemoradiotherapy for the management of high-risk salivary gland carcinomas.,Head & neck,Head Neck,2016-04-21,"Given the aggressive behavior of advanced salivary malignancies, the purpose of the current study was to explore the utility of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in this population. A retrospective study of salivary carcinomas treated from 1998 to 2013 with postoperative CRT (37 patients) or radiotherapy (RT; 103 patients) was completed. The decision to utilize adjuvant CRT versus RT was influenced by tumor grade and histology, cervical lymph node status, surgical margins, and perineural invasion. In both treatment cohorts, high locoregional control rates were obtained (79% for CRT vs 91% for RT; p = .031). Multivariate Cox regression analysis did not identify a difference in 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) with the use of CRT versus RT (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.783; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.396-1.549; p = .482).

PC is typically resistant to therapy, with a median overall survival of only 31 months. There is no standard treatment for PC, but maximal safe resection and radiation are performed when possible. Encouraging preliminary data on the use of temozolomide (TMZ)-based therapy has been previously reported. We report the response to therapy and safety of radiation with concurrent temozolomide (RT/TMZ) in 2 adult patients with heavily pretreated PC and extraneural metastases. Both patients had prior history of pituitary macroadenoma. At the time of diagnosis of PC, Ki-67 % was 24.2 and 10 %, with positive p53 staining in one case. Metastatic sites included lymph nodes, liver and bone. Case-1 received RT/TMZ to the tumor bed in the skull base and to the metastases in the cervical lymph nodes. Case-2 received RT/TMZ to recurrent tumor involving portacaval lymph nodes. Both patients achieved excellent long-term control of the sites of treated extraneural metastases, with no significant acute or delayed toxicity.

We report 2 new cases of laryngeal NK/T-cell lymphoma, and we discuss the process of the diagnosis of this disease, the choice of treatment, and treatment outcomes. We also summarize all 31 cases reported thus far. Symptoms of laryngeal NK/T-cell lymphoma are difficult to differentiate from those of other laryngeal diseases. The most common laryngeal subsite in the reported cases was the supraglottis, and roughly one-third of these cases involved the cervical lymph nodes. Because of our limited experience with this disease and the difficulties encountered in interpreting the pathologic findings, most patients required multiple biopsies over a few months before their diagnosis was confirmed. The outcome of treatment was generally poor. Radiotherapy, alone or combined with chemotherapy, was superior to chemotherapy alone in treating this disease in its early stages.

Loss of Dependence on Continued Expression of the Human Papillomavirus 16 E7 Oncogene in Cervical Cancers and Precancerous Lesions Arising in Fanconi Anemia Pathway-Deficient Mice.,mBio,mBio,2016-05-17,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disorder caused by defects in DNA damage repair. FA patients often develop squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) at sites where high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are known to cause cancer, including the cervix. However, SCCs found in human FA patients are often HPV negative, even though the majority of female FA patients with anogenital cancers had preexisting HPV-positive dysplasia. We hypothesize that HPVs contribute to the development of SCCs in FA patients but that the continued expression of HPV oncogenes is not required for the maintenance of the cancer state because FA deficiency leads to an accumulation of mutations in cellular genes that render the cancer no longer dependent upon viral oncogenes. We tested this hypothesis, making use of Bi-L E7 transgenic mice in which we temporally controlled expression of HPV16 E7, the dominant viral oncogene in HPV-associated cancers. As seen before, the persistence of cervical neoplastic disease was highly dependent upon the continued expression of HPV16 E7 in FA-sufficient mice. However, in mice with FA deficiency, cervical cancers persisted in a large fraction of the mice after HPV16 E7 expression was turned off, indicating that these cancers had escaped from their dependency on E7. Furthermore, the severity of precancerous lesions also failed to be reduced significantly in the mice with FA deficiency upon turning off expression of E7. These findings confirm our hypothesis and may explain the fact that, while FA patients have a high frequency of infections by HPVs and HPV-induced precancerous lesions, the cancers are frequently HPV negative. IMPORTANCE  : Fanconi anemia (FA) patients are at high risk for developing squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) at sites where high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) frequently cause cancer. Yet these SCCs are often HPV negative. FA patients have a genetic defect in their capacity to repair damaged DNA. HPV oncogenes cause an accumulation of DNA damage.

Retrospective analysis of the ACS-NSQIP database (Canadian Task Force Classification II.1). Academic and community healthcare institutions across the United States. Women who underwent at least 1 major laparoscopic surgery for uterine, ovarian, and cervical cancers. Data were collected on surgical procedures, patient demographic variables, type of malignancy and VTE, and mortality outcomes within 30 days of surgery. VTE was defined as deep venous thrombosis requiring therapy and pulmonary embolism confirmed by imaging or autopsy within 30 days of surgery. Of the 2219 patients included in the final analysis, 15 patients (.7%) were diagnosed with VTE within 30 days after surgery. Six patients (.3%) were diagnosed before discharge, and 9 patients (.4%) were diagnosed after discharge. The median time from surgery to diagnosis was 6 days (range, 0-28 days). Although most patients included in the study had uterine cancer (86%, n = 1913), no difference was noted based on the site of cancer (.5% for cervical cancer, .7% for endometrial cancer, and .8% for ovarian cancer; p = .95). There was no difference in rate of VTE when stratified by age (p = .10), body mass index (p = .68), diabetes (p = .22), smoking (p = .60), respiratory morbidities (p = .55), cardiac disease (p = .22), hypertension (p = .13), preoperative blood transfusion (p = .90), or American Society of Anesthesiologists class (p = .10). There was a trend toward higher risk of VTE among patients with disseminated cancer compared with those with early cancers (3.6% vs .6%, p = .05). No difference was found in the risk of VTE based on operative time (.7% for <2 hours, .6% for 2-3 hours, and .7% for >3 hours; p = .96). No difference was noted in the risk of VTE among those who underwent lymphadenectomy compared with those who did not (.9% vs .5%, p = .35). In multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusting age (p = .12), body mass index (p = .90), operative time (p = .71), and lymphadenectomy (p = .30), none of these variables was significantly associated with risk of VTE. In multivariable analysis adjusting for other confounders, VTE within 30 days was a significant predictor of higher 30-day mortality (OR, 26.0; 95% CI, 2.2-306.9; p = .01). The rate of VTE is low after major laparoscopic surgery for gynecologic cancers but is associated with increased 30-day mortality. Universal or extended thromboprophylaxis does not appear to be indicated for all patients.

Determinants of cancer screening in Asian-Americans.,Cancer causes & control : CCC,Cancer Causes Control,2016-07-02,"Recent data suggest that Asian-Americans (AsAs) are more likely to present with advanced disease when diagnosed with cancer. We sought to determine whether AsAs are under-utilizing recommended cancer screening. Cross-sectional analysis of the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System comprising of AsAs and non-Hispanic White (NHW) community-dwelling individuals (English and Spanish speaking) eligible for colorectal, breast, cervical, or prostate cancer screening according to the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommendations. Age, education and income level, residence location, marital status, health insurance, regular access to healthcare provider, and screening were extracted. Complex samples logistic regression models quantified the effect of race on odds of undergoing appropriate screening. Data were analyzed in 2015. Weighted samples of 63.3, 33.3, 47.9, and 30.3 million individuals eligible for colorectal, breast, cervical, and prostate cancer screening identified, respectively. In general, AsAs were more educated, more often married, had higher levels of income, and lived in urban/suburban residencies as compared to NHWs (all p < 0.05). In multivariable analyses, AsAs had lower odds of undergoing colorectal (odds ratio [OR] 0.78, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.96), cervical (OR 0.45, 95 % CI 0.36-0.55), and prostate cancer (OR 0.55, 95 % CI 0.39-0.78) screening and similar odds of undergoing breast cancer (OR 1.29, 95 % CI 0.92-1.82) screening as compared to NHWs.

Application of flat panel OLED display technology for the point-of-care detection of circulating cancer biomarkers.,Scientific reports,Sci Rep,2016-07-04,"Point-of-care molecular diagnostics can provide efficient and cost-effective medical care, and they have the potential to fundamentally change our approach to global health. However, most existing approaches are not scalable to include multiple biomarkers. As a solution, we have combined commercial flat panel OLED display technology with protein microarray technology to enable high-density fluorescent, programmable, multiplexed biorecognition in a compact and disposable configuration with clinical-level sensitivity. Our approach leverages advances in commercial display technology to reduce pre-functionalized biosensor substrate costs to pennies per cm(2). Here, we demonstrate quantitative detection of IgG antibodies to multiple viral antigens in patient serum samples with detection limits for human IgG in the 10 pg/mL range.

Transthoracic Anastomotic Leak After Esophagectomy: Current Trends.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2016-07-12,"Leaks from intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis are thought to be associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality than leaks from cervical anastomosis. We challenge this assumption and hypothesize that there is no significant difference in mortality based on the location of the esophagogastric anastomosis. A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed and Embase databases on all studies published from January 2000 to June 2015, comparing transthoracic (TTE) and transhiatal (THE) esophagectomies. Studies using jejunal or colonic interposition were excluded. Outcomes analyzed were leak rate, leak-associated mortality, overall 30-day mortality, and overall morbidity. Meta-analyses were performed using Mantel-Haenszel statistical analyses on studies reporting leak rates of both approaches. Nominal data are presented as frequency and interquartile range (IQR); measures of the association between treatments and outcomes are presented as odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence interval. Twenty-one studies (3 randomized controlled trials) were analyzed comprising of 7167 patients (54 % TTE). TTE approach yields a lower anastomotic leak rate (9.8 %; IQR 6.0-12.2 %) than THE (12 %; IQR 11.6-22.1 %; OR 0.56 [0.34-0.92]), without any significant difference in leak associated mortality (7.1 % TTE vs. 4.6 % THE: OR 1.83 [0.39-8.52]).

Impact of postoperative intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) on the rate of bowel obstruction in gynecologic malignancy.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2016-07-30,"The purpose was to determine the potential impact of IMRT on the rate of bowel obstruction (BO), in patients with gynecologic malignancies undergoing postoperative pelvic RT. We performed a retrospective review of all patients with endometrial or cervical cancer who received postoperative pelvic RT at our institution from 2000 to 2012. Patients who received definitive or palliative RT, or those with BO due to disease progression, were excluded. Standard two-sided statistical tests were used to evaluate for associated risk factors. Kaplan-Meier, Log rank and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis tests were performed for actuarial analysis. A total of 224 patients were identified, 120 (54%) received postoperative pelvic IMRT and 104 (46%) 3-dimentional (3-D) RT. Median follow-up time was 67months. BO was grade 1 (asymptomatic) in 2/228 (0.9%), grade 2 (conservative management) in 4 (1.8%), and grade 3≥ in 4 (1.8%). Overall, the 5-year actuarial rate of BO was 4.8%. The 5-year rate of BO in the IMRT group was 0.9% compared to 9.3% for 3-D RT (p=0.006). Patients with BMI≥30kg/m(2) were less likely to develop BO (2.6% vs. 8.3; p=0.03). On multivariate analysis, only IMRT retained its significance as an independent predictor of less BO (p=0.022). The use of postoperative IMRT for cervical and endometrial cancer was associated with significant reduction in the rate of bowel obstruction. This difference maintained its statistical significance on multivariate analysis.

Mixed Mesonephric Adenocarcinoma and High-grade Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Uterine Cervix: Case Description of a Previously Unreported Entity With Insights Into Its Molecular Pathogenesis.,International journal of gynecological pathology : official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Pathologists,Int. J. Gynecol. Pathol.,2017-01-01,"Human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative cervical carcinomas are uncommon and typically encompass unusual histologic subtypes. Mesonephric adenocarcinoma is one such subtype. Mesonephric tumors in the female genital tract are thought to arise from Wolffian remnants, and are extremely rare tumors with widely variable morphology. Sarcomatoid dedifferentiation has been previously described in a few cases, but other forms of dedifferentiation have not been reported. Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix (e.g. small cell carcinoma) is associated with HPV infection, typically HPV 18. These tumors often arise in association with a conventional epithelial component such as squamous cell carcinoma or usual-type endocervical adenocarcinoma. We describe a case of mesonephric adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix associated with an HPV-negative high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma at the morphologic and immunophenotypic level, for which we performed targeted massively parallel sequencing analysis of the 2 elements. Both components shared identical mutations in U2AF1 p.R156H (c.467G>A) and GATA3 p.M422fs (c.1263dupG), as well as MYCN amplification. In addition, the neuroendocrine carcinoma harbored TP53 and MST1R mutations not present in the mesonephric carcinoma.

The target population is more than 100 000 women aged 30 to 64 years who attend the Cervical Cancer Screening Program in 100 health centers in the state of Tlaxcala, Mexico. Since August 2013, all women in the region have been invited to enroll in the study. The study participants are evaluated to determine hrHPV infection using the Cobas 4800 HPV test. The HPV-16/18 genotyping and cytology triage strategies are performed as reflex tests in all hrHPV-positive participants. Women with a positive HPV-16/18 test and/or abnormal cytology (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or worse, ASCUS+) are referred for colposcopy evaluation, where a minimum of four biopsies and an endocervical sample are systematically collected. Histologic confirmation is performed by a standardized panel of pathologists. Among the 30 829 women who have been screened, the overall prevalence of hrHPV is 11.0%. The overall prevalence of HPV16 and HPV18 are 1.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Cytological abnormalities (ASCUS+) were detected in 11.8% of the hrHPV-positive women. A total of 27.0% (920/3,401) of the hrHPV-positive women were referred to colposcopy because of a positive HPV16/18 test and/or abnormal reflex cytology, (31.6% had only ASCUS+, 53.6% were HPV16/18 positive with a normal cytology result, and 9.5% were positive to both triage tests). The results of this study will help policy makers and health service providers establish the best practices for triage in cervical cancer screening in Mexico and other countries.",Journal Article,1390.0,13.0,"This paper describes the study design and baseline characteristics of the study population including the first 30 829 women who enrolled in the Forwarding Research for Improved Detection and Access for Cancer Screening and Triage FRIDA Study This is a large population based study that is evaluating the performance and cost-effectiveness of different triage strategies for high-risk HPV hrHPV positive women in Mexico The target population is more than 100 000 women aged 30 to 64 years who attend the Cancer Screening Program in 100 health centers in the state of Tlaxcala Mexico Since August 2013 all women in the region have been invited to enroll in the study The study participants are evaluated to determine hrHPV infection using the Cobas 4800 HPV test The HPV-16/18 genotyping and cytology triage strategies are performed as reflex tests in all hrHPV-positive participants Women with a positive HPV-16/18 test and/or abnormal cytology atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or worse ASCUS+ are referred for colposcopy evaluation where a minimum of four biopsies and an endocervical sample are systematically collected Histologic confirmation is performed by a standardized panel of pathologists Among the 30 829 women who have been screened the overall prevalence of hrHPV is 11.0 The overall prevalence of HPV16 and HPV18 are 1.5 and 0.7 respectively Cytological abnormalities ASCUS+ were detected in 11.8 of the hrHPV-positive women A total of 27.0 920/3,401 of the hrHPV-positive women were referred to colposcopy because of a positive HPV16/18 test and/or abnormal reflex cytology 31.6 had only ASCUS+ 53.6 were HPV16/18 positive with a normal cytology result and 9.5 were positive to both triage tests The results of this study will help policy makers and health service providers establish the best practices for triage in cancer screening in Mexico and other countries",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[26, 2817, 2677, 3, 45, 771, 2, 330, 374, 1, 3, 45, 266, 141, 3, 157, 201, 13904, 117, 54, 346, 4, 3, 68849, 389, 9, 231, 638, 2, 1655, 9, 12, 453, 2, 9059, 68850, 45, 26, 16, 8, 375, 266, 90, 45, 17, 16, 1435, 3, 528, 2, 835, 1236, 1, 338, 9059, 422, 9, 64, 43, 933, 17544, 109, 117, 4, 10109, 3, 283, 266, 16, 80, 76, 394, 984, 117, 1032, 201, 6, 660, 60, 54, 14166, 3, 12, 453, 1243, 4, 394, 341, 1168, 4, 3, 1309, 1, 68851, 10109, 1192, 2480, 1346, 62, 117, 4, 3, 1053, 47, 85, 7594, 6, 6559, 4, 3, 45, 3, 45, 776, 32, 194, 6, 223, 17544, 930, 75, 3, 12053, 26153, 933, 412, 3, 933, 245, 203, 2686, 2, 2045, 9059, 422, 32, 173, 22, 10265, 895, 4, 62, 17544, 109, 776, 117, 5, 8, 109, 933, 245, 203, 412, 2, 15, 1668, 2045, 1973, 691, 37, 1, 5206, 724, 15, 639, 21337, 32, 1995, 9, 9946, 451, 1257, 8, 2499, 1, 294, 1154, 2, 35, 10174, 1000, 32, 3390, 786, 884, 3551, 16, 173, 20, 8, 1670, 993, 1, 3354, 107, 3, 201, 13904, 117, 54, 47, 85, 2261, 3, 63, 1078, 1, 17544, 16, 175, 13, 3, 63, 1078, 1, 4048, 2, 33514, 32, 14, 33, 2, 13, 67, 106, 9019, 1171, 21337, 11, 530, 4, 175, 66, 1, 3, 17544, 109, 117, 8, 181, 1, 428, 13, 11533, 27, 7191, 1, 3, 17544, 109, 117, 11, 1995, 6, 9946, 408, 1, 8, 109, 4048, 203, 412, 2, 15, 1668, 10265, 2045, 456, 49, 42, 158, 21337, 699, 49, 11, 4048, 203, 109, 5, 8, 295, 2045, 757, 2, 83, 33, 11, 109, 6, 110, 9059, 895, 3, 99, 1, 26, 45, 303, 987, 4196, 10888, 2, 341, 3086, 1994, 1811, 3, 824, 2634, 9, 9059, 4, 12, 453, 4, 10109, 2, 127, 2115]",1898.0,27557378,604
Association between Time since Cancer Diagnosis and Health-Related Quality of Life: A Population-Level Analysis.,Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research,Value Health,2016-04-07,"To examine the association between time since cancer diagnosis and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among cancer survivors in remission. Analyzing data from 3,610 cancer survivors and 59,539 individuals without cancer in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we examined the relationship between time since cancer diagnosis and HRQOL, taking remission status into account and controlling for patients' demographic characteristics and comorbidities. HRQOL measurements included the six-dimensional health state short form (derived from 36-item short form health survey) (SF-6D) utility scores, the physical component summary score, and the mental component summary score. The relationship between time since cancer diagnosis and HRQOL varied substantially across cancer types. Compared with individuals without cancer, survivors of breast, prostate, or poor-prognosis cancer had statistically lower SF-6D scores within 2 years of diagnosis (-0.044, -0.062, and -0.088, respectively). Breast cancer survivors had SF-6D scores similar to those of individuals without cancer after 2 years, as did patients with poor-prognosis cancer after 5 years. Nevertheless, even after a period of 10 years, survivors of prostate or cervical cancer had a lower level of SF-6D scores (-0.027 and -0.042, respectively). The comparisons of physical health between cancer survivors and individuals without cancer were similar to those of SF-6D. In contrast, most cancer survivors did not experience poorer mental health; survivors of prostate or cervical cancer, however, had lower mental component summary scores after 10 years of diagnosis. The level of HRQOL among cancer survivors depends on time since cancer diagnosis and cancer type. Some cancer survivors have lower HRQOL after a decade of diagnosis, even in remission.",Journal Article,1384.0,13.0,"To examine the association between time since cancer diagnosis and health-related quality of life HRQOL among cancer survivors in remission Analyzing data from 3,610 cancer survivors and 59,539 individuals without cancer in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey we examined the relationship between time since cancer diagnosis and HRQOL taking remission status into account and controlling for patients demographic characteristics and comorbidities HRQOL measurements included the six-dimensional health state short form derived from 36-item short form health survey SF-6D utility scores the physical component summary score and the mental component summary score The relationship between time since cancer diagnosis and HRQOL varied substantially across cancer types Compared with individuals without cancer survivors of or poor-prognosis cancer had statistically lower SF-6D scores within 2 years of diagnosis -0.044 -0.062 and -0.088 respectively cancer survivors had SF-6D scores similar to those of individuals without cancer after 2 years as did patients with poor-prognosis cancer after 5 years Nevertheless even after a period of 10 years survivors of or cancer had a lower level of SF-6D scores -0.027 and -0.042 respectively The comparisons of physical health between cancer survivors and individuals without cancer were similar to those of SF-6D In contrast most cancer survivors did not experience poorer mental health survivors of or cancer however had lower mental component summary scores after 10 years of diagnosis The level of HRQOL among cancer survivors depends on time since cancer diagnosis and cancer type Some cancer survivors have lower HRQOL after a decade of diagnosis even in remission",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[6, 1004, 3, 248, 59, 98, 1192, 12, 147, 2, 341, 139, 372, 1, 358, 2534, 107, 12, 332, 4, 734, 4449, 74, 29, 27, 11302, 12, 332, 2, 728, 11416, 869, 187, 12, 4, 3, 484, 8699, 993, 1407, 21, 409, 3, 858, 59, 98, 1192, 12, 147, 2, 2534, 2727, 734, 156, 237, 1967, 2, 1893, 9, 7, 1540, 374, 2, 1909, 2534, 1685, 159, 3, 437, 2201, 341, 1309, 978, 1297, 526, 29, 511, 3471, 978, 1297, 341, 1407, 4086, 13451, 1207, 703, 3, 900, 1249, 1962, 368, 2, 3, 3031, 1249, 1962, 368, 3, 858, 59, 98, 1192, 12, 147, 2, 2534, 2051, 2109, 716, 12, 630, 72, 5, 869, 187, 12, 332, 1, 15, 334, 356, 12, 42, 712, 280, 4086, 13451, 703, 262, 18, 60, 1, 147, 13, 6194, 13, 12139, 2, 13, 13848, 106, 12, 332, 42, 4086, 13451, 703, 288, 6, 135, 1, 869, 187, 12, 50, 18, 60, 22, 205, 7, 5, 334, 356, 12, 50, 33, 60, 3873, 871, 50, 8, 727, 1, 79, 60, 332, 1, 15, 12, 42, 8, 280, 301, 1, 4086, 13451, 703, 13, 4523, 2, 13, 5606, 106, 3, 2213, 1, 900, 341, 59, 12, 332, 2, 869, 187, 12, 11, 288, 6, 135, 1, 4086, 13451, 4, 748, 96, 12, 332, 205, 44, 730, 1769, 3031, 341, 332, 1, 15, 12, 137, 42, 280, 3031, 1249, 1962, 703, 50, 79, 60, 1, 147, 3, 301, 1, 2534, 107, 12, 332, 3828, 23, 98, 1192, 12, 147, 2, 12, 267, 476, 12, 332, 47, 280, 2534, 50, 8, 2025, 1, 147, 871, 4, 734]",1712.0,27565280,725
"Differences in sex distribution, anatomic location and MR imaging appearance of pediatric compared to adult chordomas.",BMC medical imaging,BMC Med Imaging,2016-09-08,"Chordomas are rare malignancies that primarily affect adults, but also rarely affect pediatric patients. We compared the imaging appearance, demographic and anatomic distributions of adult and pediatric chordomas in a large cohort. We performed a retrospective review of medical records of 220 subjects with histologically confirmed chordomas of the axial skeleton and pre-treatment magnetic resonance imaging studies. Age, sex, type of chordoma (conventional, chondroid or dedifferentiated), the anatomic location of the chordoma, as well as whether the lesion was primarily extra-osseous were recorded. Pediatric subjects were less than 21 years at the time of diagnosis. Binomial two-sample tests of proportions and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare proportions between the pediatric and adult subjects. Fifty six pediatric subjects (58.9 % female) and 164 adult subjects (42.1 % female) were identified. The proportion of female subjects with chordomas was significantly higher in the pediatric cohort compared to the adult cohort (P = 0.04). Most chordomas occur in Caucasians, however African-Americans were more represented in the pediatric cohort than in the adult cohort (P = 0.01). 69.6 % (39/56) of the pediatric chordomas involved the clivus/skull base and cervical spine compared to 29.3 % (48/164) of the adult chordomas (P = 1.99 × 10(-7)). Only 1.8 % (1/56) of the pediatric chordomas was in the sacrococcygeal region compared to 36.0 % (59/164) of the adult chordomas (P = 2.55 × 10(-8)). In cases where pre-treatment imaging was available, 93.8 % (16/17) of pediatric chordomas were predominantly extra-osseous compared to 76.7 % (46/60) of adult chordomas (P = 0.17).

Menopausal hormone therapy in cancer survivors: A narrative review of the literature.,Maturitas,Maturitas,2016-07-27,"Decision making regarding the use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) for the treatment of bothersome menopausal symptoms in a cancer survivor can be complex, and includes assessment of its impact on disease-free or overall survival. Estrogen receptors are present in several cancer types, but this does not always result in estrogen-mediated tumor proliferation and adverse cancer-related outcomes. Estrogen may even be protective against certain cancers. Menopausal hormone therapy is associated with an increased risk of recurrence and mortality after diagnosis of some cancer types, but not others. We provide a narrative review of the medical literature regarding the risk of cancer recurrence and associated mortality with initiation of MHT after the diagnosis of breast, gynecologic, lung, colorectal, hematologic cancers, and melanoma. Menopausal hormone therapy may be considered for management of bothersome menopausal symptoms in women with some cancer types (e.g., colorectal and hematologic cancer, localized melanoma, and most cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancers), while nonhormonal treatment options may be preferred for others (e.g., breast cancer).

Leveraging premalignant biology for immune-based cancer prevention.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2016-09-16,"Prevention is an essential component of cancer eradication. Next-generation sequencing of cancer genomes and epigenomes has defined large numbers of driver mutations and molecular subgroups, leading to therapeutic advances. By comparison, there is a relative paucity of such knowledge in premalignant neoplasia, which inherently limits the potential to develop precision prevention strategies. Studies on the interplay between germ-line and somatic events have elucidated genetic processes underlying premalignant progression and preventive targets. Emerging data hint at the immune system's ability to intercept premalignancy and prevent cancer. Genetically engineered mouse models have identified mechanisms by which genetic drivers and other somatic alterations recruit inflammatory cells and induce changes in normal cells to create and interact with the premalignant tumor microenvironment to promote oncogenesis and immune evasion. These studies are currently limited to only a few lesion types and patients. In this Perspective, we advocate a large-scale collaborative effort to systematically map the biology of premalignancy and the surrounding cellular response. By bringing together scientists from diverse disciplines (e.g., biochemistry, omics, and computational biology; microbiology, immunology, and medical genetics; engineering, imaging, and synthetic chemistry; and implementation science), we can drive a concerted effort focused on cancer vaccines to reprogram the immune response to prevent, detect, and reject premalignancy.

Disparities in standard of care treatment and associated survival decrement in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2016-09-16,"Standard of care (SOC) treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer includes pelvic external beam radiation (EBRT) with chemotherapy and interdigitated brachytherapy. We evaluated national utilization trends and factors associated with receiving SOC therapy. We utilized the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to identify women with locally advanced cervical cancer treated with definitive radiation or chemoradiation therapy and stratified these patients by treatment received. We identified 15,194 patients. Only 44.3% of patients received SOC treatment and this group had significantly improved OS. High volume centers, academic centers, comprehensive community cancer centers, private insurance, and higher income, were all associated with an increased likelihood of receiving SOC, whereas Black patients were less likely to receive SOC. We found 26.8% of patients received no radiation boost, 23.8% received an EBRT boost only, and 49.5% of patients received EBRT with brachytherapy. Although an EBRT boost was advantageous over no boost at all (HR 0.720, p<0.001), OS was superior in patients who received brachytherapy (HR 0.554, p<0.001). Patients were more likely to receive no radiotherapy boost if they had lower incomes, Medicaid, were treated at low volume centers, or were treated at non-comprehensive community cancer centers. SOC for locally advanced cervical cancer offers superior outcomes, yet less than half of patients receive SOC and there are disparities in which patients receive SOC treatment.

The aims of this study were to determine the effect of comorbidities on the time to diagnostic resolution after an abnormal cancer screening test and to examine whether patient navigation improves the timeliness and likelihood of diagnostic resolution for patients with comorbidities in comparison with no navigation. A secondary analysis of comorbidity data collected by Patient Navigation Research Program sites using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was conducted. The participants were 6,349 patients with abnormal breast, cervical, colon, or prostate cancer screening tests between 2007 and 2011. The intervention was patient navigation or usual care. The CCI data were highly skewed across projects and cancer sites, and the CCI scores were categorized as 0 (CCI score of 0 or no comorbidities identified; 76% of cases); 1 (CCI score of 1; 16% of cases), or 2 (CCI score ≥ 2; 8% of cases). Separate adjusted hazard ratios for each site and cancer type were obtained, and then they were pooled with a meta-analysis random effects methodology. Patients with a CCI score ≥ 2 had delayed diagnostic resolution after an abnormal cancer screening test in comparison with those with no comorbidities. Patient navigation reduced delays in diagnostic resolution, with the greatest benefits seen for those with a CCI score ≥ 2. Persons with a CCI score ≥ 2 experienced significant delays in timely diagnostic care in comparison with patients without comorbidities. Patient navigation was effective in reducing delays in diagnostic resolution among those with CCI scores > 1.

Immunogenomics of Hypermutated Glioblastoma: A Patient with Germline POLE Deficiency Treated with Checkpoint Blockade Immunotherapy.,Cancer discovery,Cancer Discov,2016-09-28,"We present the case of a patient with a left frontal glioblastoma with primitive neuroectodermal tumor features and hypermutated genotype in the setting of a POLE germline alteration. During standard-of-care chemoradiation, the patient developed a cervical spine metastasis and was subsequently treated with pembrolizumab. Shortly thereafter, the patient developed an additional metastatic spinal lesion. Using whole-exome DNA sequencing and clonal analysis, we report changes in the subclonal architecture throughout treatment. Furthermore, a persistently high neoantigen load was observed within all tumors. Interestingly, following initiation of pembrolizumab, brisk lymphocyte infiltration was observed in the subsequently resected metastatic spinal lesion and an objective radiographic response was noted in a progressive intracranial lesion, suggestive of active central nervous system (CNS) immunosurveillance following checkpoint blockade therapy. It is unclear whether hypermutated glioblastomas are susceptible to checkpoint blockade in adults. Herein, we provide proof of principle that glioblastomas with DNA-repair defects treated with checkpoint blockade may result in CNS immune activation, leading to clinically and immunologically significant responses. These patients may represent a genomically stratified group for whom immunotherapy could be considered.

Brachytherapy should not be omitted when treating locally advanced neuroendocrine cervical cancer with definitive chemoradiation therapy.,Brachytherapy,Brachytherapy,2016-10-04,"Neuroendocrine cervical cancer is a rare malignancy with a poor prognosis, yet there is a paucity of data to guide treatment decisions when managing patients with this diagnosis. Specifically, there are little data to aid practitioners in deciding if there is added value to brachytherapy given the additional time, cost, discomfort, and toxicity to patients. We used the National Cancer Data Base to identify women with locally advanced neuroendocrine cervical cancer treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy to determine if the addition of brachytherapy improves outcomes in this disease. We also assessed outcomes based on chemotherapy timing in this cohort. We identified 100 patients with locally advanced nonmetastatic neuroendocrine cervical cancer that were treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy between 2004 and 2012. There was a substantial improvement in overall survival when brachytherapy was administered in addition to external beam radiotherapy. In multivariate analysis, the addition of brachytherapy, compared with external beam radiotherapy alone, was associated with an improved median survival of 48.6 vs. 21.6 months (hazard ratio (HR), 0.475; 95% CI, 0.255-0.883; p = 0.019).

Impact of treatment year on survival and adverse effects in patients with cervical cancer and paraortic lymph node metastases treated with definitive extended-field radiation therapy.,Practical radiation oncology,Pract Radiat Oncol,2016-09-07,"Treatment for locoregionally advanced cervical cancer has changed dramatically since 2000. In that year, delivery of radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy became standard, and in the early 2000s, use of intensity modulated RT (IMRT) and positron emission tomography (PET) became more prevalent. We sought to determine the impact of these changes on disease-specific survival (DSS) and treatment-related adverse effects in patients with cervical cancer with para-aortic lymph node (PAN) metastases treated with definitive extended-field radiation therapy. We reviewed the medical records of 103 patients with cervical cancer with PAN metastases treated with curative intent at our institution during 2000 to 2013. DSS, disease control in PANs, and treatment-associated adverse effects were compared between patient groups defined by treatment year. The 5-year DSS rate was 23% (95% confidence interval, 9%-38%) for the 34 patients treated from 2000 to 2004, and 47% (95% confidence interval, 36%-59%) for the 69 patients treated from 2005 to 2013 (P = .005). Factors associated with improved DSS included concurrent chemoradiation (P = .001), baseline PET imaging (P = .01), and treatment of PANs with IMRT (P = .02). Only 3 patients (4%) treated from 2005 to 2013 versus 6 patients (18%) treated from 2000 to 2004 had recurrence in PANs (P = .03). Most recurrences in patients treated from 2005 to 2013 were at distant sites. The crude rate of grade 3 or higher late treatment-related adverse effects was 17%; of the 18 patients who developed serious adverse effects, 8 were being treated for recurrent disease at the time. Adverse effects most frequently involved the gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems. Outcomes for patients with cervical cancer with PAN metastases have improved concurrently with advances in treatment, including PET and IMRT. Future studies should focus on ways to improve systemic treatments and reduce late adverse effects without compromising local control.",Journal Article,1231.0,7.0,Treatment for locoregionally advanced cancer has changed dramatically since 2000 In that year delivery of radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy became standard and in the early 2000s use of intensity modulated RT IMRT and positron emission tomography PET became more prevalent We sought to determine the impact of these changes on disease-specific survival DSS and treatment-related adverse effects in patients with cancer with para-aortic lymph node PAN metastases treated with definitive extended-field radiation therapy We reviewed the medical records of 103 patients with cancer with PAN metastases treated with curative intent at our institution during 2000 to 2013 DSS disease control in PANs and treatment-associated adverse effects were compared between patient groups defined by treatment year The 5-year DSS rate was 23 95 confidence interval 9 -38 for the 34 patients treated from 2000 to 2004 and 47 95 confidence interval 36 -59 for the 69 patients treated from 2005 to 2013 P .005 Factors associated with improved DSS included concurrent chemoradiation P .001 baseline PET imaging P .01 and treatment of PANs with IMRT P .02 Only 3 patients 4 treated from 2005 to 2013 versus 6 patients 18 treated from 2000 to 2004 had recurrence in PANs P .03 Most recurrences in patients treated from 2005 to 2013 were at distant sites The crude rate of grade 3 or higher late treatment-related adverse effects was 17 of the 18 patients who developed serious adverse effects 8 were being treated for recurrent disease at the time Adverse effects most frequently involved the and genitourinary systems Outcomes for patients with cancer with PAN metastases have improved concurrently with advances in treatment including PET and IMRT Future studies should focus on ways to improve systemic treatments and reduce late adverse effects without compromising local control,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[24, 9, 6410, 131, 12, 71, 2368, 2729, 1192, 1081, 4, 17, 111, 989, 1, 121, 36, 5, 750, 56, 3451, 260, 2, 4, 3, 191, 17373, 119, 1, 837, 1757, 240, 964, 2, 1900, 1799, 872, 495, 3451, 80, 2485, 21, 990, 6, 223, 3, 345, 1, 46, 400, 23, 34, 112, 25, 1788, 2, 24, 139, 290, 176, 4, 7, 5, 12, 5, 4615, 3938, 263, 289, 3055, 196, 73, 5, 1057, 1747, 1067, 121, 36, 21, 446, 3, 484, 1064, 1, 3283, 7, 5, 12, 5, 3055, 196, 73, 5, 1075, 1697, 28, 114, 731, 190, 1081, 6, 1346, 1788, 34, 182, 4, 22776, 2, 24, 41, 290, 176, 11, 72, 59, 69, 271, 395, 20, 24, 111, 3, 33, 111, 1788, 116, 10, 382, 48, 307, 268, 83, 519, 9, 3, 562, 7, 73, 29, 1081, 6, 1131, 2, 662, 48, 307, 268, 511, 728, 9, 3, 790, 7, 73, 29, 1242, 6, 1346, 19, 1614, 130, 41, 5, 231, 1788, 159, 750, 975, 19, 144, 330, 495, 270, 19, 355, 2, 24, 1, 22776, 5, 964, 19, 588, 158, 27, 7, 39, 73, 29, 1242, 6, 1346, 185, 49, 7, 203, 73, 29, 1081, 6, 1131, 42, 146, 4, 22776, 19, 680, 96, 1593, 4, 7, 73, 29, 1242, 6, 1346, 11, 28, 626, 633, 3, 6622, 116, 1, 88, 27, 15, 142, 807, 24, 139, 290, 176, 10, 269, 1, 3, 203, 7, 54, 276, 1762, 290, 176, 66, 11, 486, 73, 9, 387, 34, 28, 3, 98, 290, 176, 96, 746, 646, 3, 2, 4109, 1530, 123, 9, 7, 5, 12, 5, 3055, 196, 47, 231, 3294, 5, 954, 4, 24, 141, 495, 2, 964, 508, 94, 257, 1222, 23, 4245, 6, 401, 403, 640, 2, 969, 807, 290, 176, 187, 6102, 293, 182]",1874.0,27743802,333

HPV vaccine coverage in the United States (U.S.) remains low, particularly among older adolescents/young adults, and the uninsured. We assessed awareness and knowledge of HPV disease, HPV-related cancers, and HPV vaccines among working, uninsured adults. Data from the 2014 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 4, Cycle 4) were used as a benchmark. Patients were surveyed in late 2014 at the Volunteers in Medicine free clinic in Duval County, Florida. Surveys contained validated measures of HPV disease and vaccine knowledge; HPV-related cancer knowledge was also assessed. Two-hundred and ninety-six surveys were analyzable with an 84% participation rate. Half (50.3%) of participants had heard of HPV, and 32.1% had heard of the HPV vaccine; in HINTS, these estimates were 63.6% and 62.7%, respectively (both P < 0.0001). In adjusted models, high HPV disease knowledge was associated with white race and increased education; high vaccine knowledge was associated with white race, increased education, and female sex. Recognition of HPV as a causative agent was 43.9% for cervical, 9.1% for anal, and 11.1% for throat cancers. For all HPV-associated cancers, participants had lower knowledge/recognition relative to HINTS.

Comparison of Computed Tomography- and Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Clinical Target Volume Contours at Brachytherapy for Cervical Cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2016-07-30,"We prospectively compared computed tomography (CT)- and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV) contours at the time of brachytherapy for cervical cancer in an effort to identify patients who might benefit most from MRI-based planning. Thirty-seven patients who had undergone a pretreatment diagnostic MRI scan were included in the analysis. We delineated the HR-CTV on the brachytherapy CT and brachytherapy MRI scans independently for each patient. We then calculated the absolute volumes for each HR-CTV and the Dice coefficient of similarity (DC, a measure of spatial agreement) for the HR-CTV contours. We identified the clinical and tumor factors associated with (1) a discrepancy in volume between the CT HR-CTV and MRI HR-CTV contours; and (2) DC. The mean values were compared using 1-way analysis of variance or paired or unpaired t tests, as appropriate. Simple and multivariable linear regression analyses were used to model the effects of covariates on the outcomes. Patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IB to IVA cervical cancer were treated with intracavitary brachytherapy using tandem and ovoid (n=33) or tandem and cylinder (n=4) applicators. The mean CT HR-CTV volume (44.1 cm<sup>3</sup>) was larger than the mean MRI HR-CTV volume (35.1 cm<sup>3</sup>; P<.0001, paired t test).

Prospective Validation of a High Dimensional Shape Model for Organ Motion in Intact Cervical Cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2016-08-22,"Validated models are needed to justify strategies to define planning target volumes (PTVs) for intact cervical cancer used in clinical practice. Our objective was to independently validate a previously published shape model, using data collected prospectively from clinical trials. We analyzed 42 patients with intact cervical cancer treated with daily fractionated pelvic intensity modulated radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy in one of 2 prospective clinical trials. We collected online cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans before each fraction. Clinical target volume (CTV) structures from the planning computed tomography scan were cast onto each CBCT scan after rigid registration and manually redrawn to account for organ motion and deformation. We applied the 95% isodose cloud from the planning computed tomography scan to each CBCT scan and computed any CTV outside the 95% isodose cloud. The primary aim was to determine the proportion of CTVs that were encompassed within the 95% isodose volume. A 1-sample t test was used to test the hypothesis that the probability of complete coverage was different from 95%. We used mixed-effects logistic regression to assess effects of time and patient variability. The 95% isodose line completely encompassed 92.3% of all CTVs (95% confidence interval, 88.3%-96.4%), not significantly different from the 95% probability anticipated a priori (P=.19). The overall proportion of missed CTVs was small: the grand mean of covered CTVs was 99.9%, and 95.2% of misses were located in the anterior body of the uterus. Time did not affect coverage probability (P=.71). With the clinical implementation of a previously proposed PTV definition strategy based on a shape model for intact cervical cancer, the probability of CTV coverage was high and the volume of CTV missed was low. This PTV expansion strategy is acceptable for clinical trials and practice; however, we recommend daily image guidance to avoid systematic large misses in select patients.",Journal Article,1247.0,2.0,Validated models are needed to justify strategies to define planning target volumes PTVs for intact cancer used in clinical practice Our objective was to independently validate a previously published shape model using data collected prospectively from clinical trials We analyzed 42 patients with intact cancer treated with daily fractionated pelvic intensity modulated radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy in one of 2 prospective clinical trials We collected online cone beam computed tomography CBCT scans before each fraction Clinical target volume CTV structures from the planning computed tomography scan were cast onto each CBCT scan after rigid registration and manually redrawn to account for organ motion and deformation We applied the 95 isodose cloud from the planning computed tomography scan to each CBCT scan and computed any CTV outside the 95 isodose cloud The primary aim was to determine the proportion of CTVs that were encompassed within the 95 isodose volume A 1-sample t test was used to test the hypothesis that the probability of complete coverage was different from 95 We used mixed-effects logistic regression to assess effects of time and patient variability The 95 isodose line completely encompassed 92.3 of all CTVs 95 confidence interval 88.3 -96.4 not significantly different from the 95 probability anticipated a priori P=.19 The overall proportion of missed CTVs was small the grand mean of covered CTVs was 99.9 and 95.2 of misses were located in the anterior body of the Time did not affect coverage probability P=.71 With the clinical implementation of a previously proposed PTV definition strategy based on a shape model for intact cancer the probability of CTV coverage was high and the volume of CTV missed was low This PTV expansion strategy is acceptable for clinical trials and practice however we recommend daily image guidance to avoid systematic large misses in select patients,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[938, 274, 32, 575, 6, 6665, 422, 6, 1107, 1349, 283, 2225, 13631, 9, 2964, 12, 95, 4, 38, 758, 114, 461, 10, 6, 1042, 2183, 8, 373, 983, 5465, 202, 75, 74, 786, 1143, 29, 38, 143, 21, 311, 595, 7, 5, 2964, 12, 73, 5, 391, 3950, 1110, 837, 1757, 121, 36, 2, 750, 56, 4, 104, 1, 18, 482, 38, 143, 21, 786, 4123, 6939, 1345, 1220, 872, 5187, 1441, 348, 296, 1509, 38, 283, 433, 3402, 2414, 29, 3, 1349, 1220, 872, 1657, 11, 14394, 3301, 296, 5187, 1657, 50, 12782, 3169, 2, 8474, 69262, 6, 1967, 9, 1259, 2967, 2, 16377, 21, 1498, 3, 48, 8945, 27237, 29, 3, 1349, 1220, 872, 1657, 6, 296, 5187, 1657, 2, 1220, 500, 3402, 2513, 3, 48, 8945, 27237, 3, 86, 1130, 10, 6, 223, 3, 920, 1, 14256, 17, 11, 9226, 262, 3, 48, 8945, 433, 8, 14, 1000, 102, 412, 10, 95, 6, 412, 3, 1492, 17, 3, 1320, 1, 236, 2139, 10, 338, 29, 48, 21, 95, 1739, 176, 812, 320, 6, 423, 176, 1, 98, 2, 69, 1982, 3, 48, 8945, 328, 2500, 9226, 937, 27, 1, 62, 14256, 48, 307, 268, 889, 27, 921, 39, 44, 97, 338, 29, 3, 48, 1320, 4078, 8, 7499, 19, 326, 3, 63, 920, 1, 5149, 14256, 10, 302, 3, 20904, 313, 1, 4306, 14256, 10, 1058, 83, 2, 48, 18, 1, 21940, 11, 2308, 4, 3, 2882, 642, 1, 3, 98, 205, 44, 1158, 2139, 1320, 19, 792, 5, 3, 38, 2393, 1, 8, 373, 1587, 3303, 2470, 692, 90, 23, 8, 5465, 202, 9, 2964, 12, 3, 1320, 1, 3402, 2139, 10, 64, 2, 3, 433, 1, 3402, 5149, 10, 154, 26, 3303, 1422, 692, 16, 1595, 9, 38, 143, 2, 758, 137, 21, 2237, 391, 1482, 2753, 6, 3085, 1556, 375, 21940, 4, 1717, 7]",1932.0,27788953,174
Cervical metastasis in squamous cell carcinoma of the hard palate and maxillary alveolus.,"Ear, nose, & throat journal",Ear Nose Throat J,,"We conducted a retrospective study to determine the incidence and treatment outcomes of neck metastases in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the hard palate and/or maxillary alveolus after surgical excision of the primary tumor. We also sought to identify any risk factors for recurrence. Our study population was made up of 20 patients-9 men and 11 women, aged 46 to 88 years (mean: 72.6)-who had undergone excision of an SCC of the hard palate and/or maxillary alveolus at a tertiary care cancer center over a 7-year period. Half of all patients were former tobacco users. Of the 20 tumors, 10 involved the maxillary alveolus, 4 involved the hard palate, and 6 involved both sites. Three patients were clinically categorized as T1, 9 as T2, 6 as T3, and 2 as T4; pathologically, 8 tumors were categorized as T4a. In addition to maxillectomy, a neck dissection was performed in 7 patients-4 therapeutically and 3 electively. Eight of 20 patients experienced a recurrence: 4 local, 6 regional, and 2 distant (several patients had a recurrence at more than one site). Univariate analysis identified perineural invasion (p = 0.04) as a statistically significant risk factor for recurrence. Of 14 patients with a clinicopathologically negative neck, 5 (36%) developed a cervical recurrence, and 4 of them died of their disease. An advanced stage (T4 vs. <T4) was not significantly correlated with the risk of regional metastasis (p = 0.58). The rate of occult nodal metastasis in clinically and radiologically N0 necks was high. Clinical and radiologic understaging was common, and regional recurrences frequently resulted in death.

Management and outcome of cervical cancer diagnosed in pregnancy.,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol.,2016-10-31,"Cervical cancer is the third most common gynecologic malignancy in the United States. Approximately 1-3% of cervical cancers will be diagnosed in pregnant and peripartum women; optimal management in the setting of pregnancy is not always clear. We sought to describe the management of patients with cervical cancer diagnosed in pregnancy and compare their outcomes to nonpregnant women with similar baseline characteristics. We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients diagnosed with cervical cancer in pregnancy and matched them 1:2 with contemporaneous nonpregnant women of the same age diagnosed with cervical cancer of the same stage. Patients were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes and the Dana-Farber/Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Registry. Data were analyzed using Stata, Version 10.1 (College Station, TX). In all, 28 women diagnosed with cervical cancer during pregnancy were identified from 1997 through 2013. The majority were Stage IB1. In all, 25% (7/28) of women terminated the pregnancy; these women were more likely to be diagnosed earlier in pregnancy (10.9 vs 19.7 weeks, P = .006). For those who did not terminate, mean gestational age at delivery was 36.1 weeks. Pregnancy complications were uncommon. Complication rates in pregnant women undergoing radical hysterectomy were similar to those outside of pregnancy. Time to treatment was significantly longer for pregnant women compared to nonpregnant patients (20.8 vs 7.9 weeks, P = .0014) but there was no survival difference between groups (89.3% vs 95.2%, P = .08). Women who underwent gravid radical hysterectomy had significantly higher estimated blood loss than those who had a radical hysterectomy in the postpartum period (2033 vs 425 mL, P = .0064), but operative characteristics were otherwise similar. None of the pregnant women who died delayed treatment due to pregnancy. Gestational age at diagnosis is an important determinant of management of cervical cancer in pregnancy, underscoring the need for expeditious workup of abnormal cervical cytology. Of women who choose to continue the pregnancy, most delivered in the late preterm period without significant obstetric complications.

Less radical surgery for early-stage cervical cancer: Can conization specimens help identify patients at low risk for parametrial involvement?,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2016-11-21,"Radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer is associated with increased morbidity over an extrafascial hysterectomy. The goal of this study was to determine incidence of and risk factors for parametrial involvement (PI) based on conization specimen (CS) and to potentially identify candidates for less radical surgery. Patients with FIGO IA2-IIA cervical cancer treated with radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection (RH) from 2000 to 2010 were retrospectively identified. Data was extracted from operative and pathology reports. Statistical analyses were performed using Fisher's exact test, t-test, and asymptotic logistic regression. Of 267 RH patients identified, 118 (44%) had conization prior to RH. The incidence of PI was 15.7% overall and 7.5% in patients treated with conization prior to RH. There was no association between PI and histology, stage, grade, or tumor size. Conization patients with PI were more likely to have LVSI on CS (77.8% vs. 29.4%) and positive lymph nodes (LNP) (66.7% vs. 8.3%). Of patients with positive endocervical curettage, a modest 12% had PI, which was not statistically significant. Tumor size, depth of invasion, and margin status on CS were not statistically associated with PI. In logistic regression analysis, LNP alone or LNP+LVSI were predictive of PI.

Revisiting Milan cervical cancer study: Do the original findings hold in the era of chemotherapy?,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2016-11-26,"The primary treatment of early stage cervical carcinoma (IB-IIA) is either surgery or radiation therapy based on the pivotal Milan randomized study published twenty years ago. In the presence of high-risk features, the gold standard treatment is concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CRT) whether it is the in the postoperative or the definitive setting. Using the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB), the goal of our study is to compare the outcomes of surgery and radiation therapy in the chemotherapy era. Between 2004 and 2013, 5478 patients diagnosed with early stage cervical cancer were divided into 2 groups based on their primary treatment: non-surgical (n=1980) and surgical groups (n=3498). The distribution of patient/tumor characteristics and treatment variables with their relation to overall survival and proportional regression models were assessed to investigate the superiority of one approach over the other. Propensity score analysis adjusted for imbalance of covariates to create a well-matched-patient cohort. At 46months median follow-up, the 5-year overall survival was similar between both groups (73·8% vs. 75.7%; p=0.619) after applying propensity score analysis. On multivariate analysis, high Charlson comorbidity score, stage IIA disease, larger tumor size, positive lymph nodes and high-grade disease were significant predictors of poor outcome while older age and treatment approach were not.

Carcinogenic human papillomavirus infection.,Nature reviews. Disease primers,Nat Rev Dis Primers,2016-12-01,"Infections with human papillomavirus (HPV) are common and transmitted by direct contact. Although the great majority of infections resolve within 2 years, 13 phylogenetically related, sexually transmitted HPV genotypes, notably HPV16, cause - if not controlled immunologically or by screening - virtually all cervical cancers worldwide, a large fraction of other anogenital cancers and an increasing proportion of oropharyngeal cancers. The carcinogenicity of these HPV types results primarily from the activity of the oncoproteins E6 and E7, which impair growth regulatory pathways. Persistent high-risk HPVs can transition from a productive (virion-producing) to an abortive or transforming infection, after which cancer can result after typically slow accumulation of host genetic mutations. However, which precancerous lesions progress and which do not is unclear; the majority of screening-detected precancers are treated, leading to overtreatment. The discovery of HPV as a carcinogen led to the development of effective preventive vaccines and sensitive HPV DNA and RNA tests.

Does para-aortic irradiation reduce the risk of distant metastasis in advanced cervical cancer? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2016-11-28,"To evaluate the impact of the extension of the radiotherapy field cranially toward para-aortic lymph nodes (EF-RT) in advanced cervical cancer. A systematic search of databases (PubMed, CENTRAL, Clinical Trials) was performed and included studies that were published between 1960 and November 2015 without language restrictions. All randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were analyzed further. All patients must have undergone pelvic radiotherapy and the same systemic therapy in both arms. The primary endpoints were locoregional failure, incidence of distant metastasis, para-aortic failure, and cancer related death. The Mantel-Haenszel method was used in the meta-analysis. The risk of bias analysis was determined using the 7-domain method per the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions V5.1.0. A review of the treatment technique and toxicity was also performed. A total of 1309 studies were evaluated, 4 RCTs of which met the inclusion criteria; 506 patients were allocated to standard pelvic irradiation, and 494 underwent EF-RT. The risk of bias was considered to be low in nearly 80% of the domains. EF-RT significantly reduced the rate of para-aortic failure (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.19-0.64; p<0.01) and the incidence of other distant metastases (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50-0.96; p=0.03). Locoregional failure and cancer-related death were not significantly altered (OR 1.06 [0.80-1.42]; p=0.67, and 0.68 [0.45-1.01]; p=0.06, respectively). The radiotherapy technique was conventional in 3 studies and conformational in 1 study. In total, 10 treatment-related deaths occurred-4 in pelvic radiation and 6 in EF-RT (OR 2.12 [0.71-6.27]; p=0.18).

We analyzed 86 patients with stage IB through IVA cervical cancer treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy at 2 institutions according to the standards of the INTERTECC (International Evaluation of Radiotherapy Technology Effectiveness in Cervical Cancer, National Clinical Trials Network identifier: 01554397) protocol. The protocol used a planning target volume and 2 primary organs at risk: pelvic bone marrow (PBM) and bowel. Secondary organs at risk were rectum and bladder. Initial unfiltered dose-volume histogram (DVH) estimation models were trained using all 86 plans. Refined training sets were created by removing sub-optimal plans from the unfiltered sample, and DVH estimation models… and DVH estimation models were constructed by identifying 30 of 86 plans emphasizing PBM sparing (comparing protocol-specified dosimetric cutpoints V<sub>10</sub> (percentage volume of PBM receiving at least 10 Gy dose) and V<sub>20</sub> (percentage volume of PBM receiving at least 20 Gy dose) with unfiltered predictions) and another 30 of 86 plans emphasizing bowel sparing (comparing V<sub>40</sub> (absolute volume of bowel receiving at least 40 Gy dose) and V<sub>45</sub> (absolute volume of bowel receiving at least 45 Gy dose), 9 in common with the PBM set). To obtain deliverable KBP plans, refined models must inform patient-specific optimization objectives and/or priorities (an auto-planning ""routine""). Four candidate routines emphasizing different tradeoffs were composed, and a script was developed to automatically re-plan multiple patients with each routine. After selection of the routine that best met protocol objectives in the 51-patient training sample (KBP<sub>FINAL</sub>), protocol-specific DVH metrics and normal tissue complication probability were compared for original versus KBP<sub>FINAL</sub> plans across the 35-patient validation set. Paired t tests were used to test differences between planning sets. KBP<sub>FINAL</sub> plans outperformed manual planning across the validation set in all protocol-specific DVH cutpoints. The mean normal tissue complication probability for gastrointestinal toxicity was lower for KBP<sub>FINAL</sub> versus validation-set plans (48.7% vs 53.8%, P<.001). Similarly, the estimated mean white blood cell count nadir was higher (2.77 vs 2.49 k/mL, P<.001) with KBP<sub>FINAL</sub> plans, indicating lowered probability of hematologic toxicity.

"A genome-based model for adjusting radiotherapy dose (GARD): a retrospective, cohort-based study.",The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2016-12-18,"Despite its common use in cancer treatment, radiotherapy has not yet entered the era of precision medicine, and there have been no approaches to adjust dose based on biological differences between or within tumours. We aimed to assess whether a patient-specific molecular signature of radiation sensitivity could be used to identify the optimum radiotherapy dose. We used the gene-expression-based radiation-sensitivity index and the linear quadratic model to derive the genomic-adjusted radiation dose (GARD). A high GARD value predicts for high therapeutic effect for radiotherapy; which we postulate would relate to clinical outcome. Using data from the prospective, observational Total Cancer Care (TCC) protocol, we calculated GARD for primary tumours from 20 disease sites treated using standard radiotherapy doses for each disease type. We also used multivariable Cox modelling to assess whether GARD was independently associated with clinical outcome in five clinical cohorts: Erasmus Breast Cancer Cohort (n=263); Karolinska Breast Cancer Cohort (n=77); Moffitt Lung Cancer Cohort (n=60); Moffitt Pancreas Cancer Cohort (n=40); and The Cancer Genome Atlas Glioblastoma Patient Cohort (n=98). We calculated GARD for 8271 tissue samples from the TCC cohort. There was a wide range of GARD values (range 1·66-172·4) across the TCC cohort despite assignment of uniform radiotherapy doses within disease types. Median GARD values were lowest for gliomas and sarcomas and highest for cervical cancer and oropharyngeal head and neck cancer. There was a wide range of GARD values within tumour type groups. GARD independently predicted clinical outcome in breast cancer, lung cancer, glioblastoma, and pancreatic cancer. In the Erasmus Breast Cancer Cohort, 5-year distant-metastasis-free survival was longer in patients with high GARD values than in those with low GARD values (hazard ratio 2·11, 95% 1·13-3·94, p=0·018). A GARD-based clinical model could allow the individualisation of radiotherapy dose to tumour radiosensitivity and could provide a framework to design genomically-guided clinical trials in radiation oncology.

Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging as a Predictor of Outcome in Cervical Cancer After Chemoradiation.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2016-11-17,"To determine whether apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value is predictive of survival after definitive chemoradiation for cervical cancer independent of established imaging and clinical prognostic factors. Between 2011 and 2013, the pretreatment MRI scans for 69 patients treated with definitive chemoradiation for newly diagnosed cervical cancer were retrieved. Scans were acquired with a 1.5-T magnetic resonance scanner, including diffusion-weighted imaging sequences. Mean ADC value was measured within a region of interest in the primary cervical cancer on the baseline MRI scan. Baseline tumor maximum standardized uptake value on positron emission tomography/computed tomography was determined by the reading radiologist. Treatment included external beam radiation therapy to the pelvis followed by brachytherapy in 97%, and with concurrent weekly cisplatin in 99% of patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done to investigate the association of clinical and imaging variables with disease control and survival endpoints using a Cox proportional hazard test. Median follow-up was 16.7 months (range, 3.1-44.2 months). The 1-year overall survival, locoregional recurrence-free survival, and disease-free survival rates were 91%, 86%, and 74%, respectively. The median ADC value was 0.941 × 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s (range, 0.256-1.508 × 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s). The median standardized uptake value in the primary tumor was 15 (range, 6.2-43.4). In multivariate analysis, higher ADC value (hazard ratio [HR] 0.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15-0.85, P=.02), higher stage (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.5, P=.033), and nonsquamous histology (HR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07-0.82, P=.024) were independent predictors of disease-free survival. The mean ADC value of the primary tumor on pretreatment MRI was the only imaging feature that was an independent predictor of disease-free survival in cervical cancer patients treated with chemoradiation.

The American College of Radiology and the American Brachytherapy Society practice parameter for the performance of low-dose-rate brachytherapy.,Brachytherapy,Brachytherapy,,"Brachytherapy is the use of radionuclides to treat malignancies or benign conditions by means of a radiation source placed close to or into the tumor or treatment site. This practice parameter refers only to the use of radionuclide brachytherapy. Brachytherapy alone or combined with external beam therapy plays an important role in the management and treatment of patients with cancer. Low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy has traditionally been used for treating prostate, head and neck, breast, cervical, and endometrial cancers as well as obstructive bile duct, esophageal, or bronchial lesions. It has been practiced for over a century with a variety of sources including radium-226, cesium-137, and, more recently, iridium- 192, iodine-125, and palladium-103.

Bone Marrow-sparing Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy With Concurrent Cisplatin For Stage IB-IVA Cervical Cancer: An International Multicenter Phase II Clinical Trial (INTERTECC-2).,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2016-11-23,"To test the hypothesis that intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) reduces acute hematologic and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity for patients with locoregionally advanced cervical cancer. We enrolled patients with stage IB-IVA cervical carcinoma in a single-arm phase II trial involving 8 centers internationally. All patients received weekly cisplatin concurrently with once-daily IMRT, followed by intracavitary brachytherapy, as indicated. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of either acute grade ≥3 neutropenia or clinically significant GI toxicity within 30 days of completing chemoradiation therapy. A preplanned subgroup analysis tested the hypothesis that positron emission tomography-based image-guided IMRT (IG-IMRT) would lower the risk of acute neutropenia. We also longitudinally assessed patients' changes in quality of life. From October 2011 to April 2015, 83 patients met the eligibility criteria and initiated protocol therapy. The median follow-up was 26.0 months. The incidence of any primary event was 26.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 18.2%-36.9%), significantly lower than the 40% incidence hypothesized a priori from historical data (P=.012). The incidence of grade ≥3 neutropenia and clinically significant GI toxicity was 19.3% (95% CI 12.2%-29.0%) and 12.0% (95% CI 6.7%-20.8%), respectively. Compared with patients treated without IG-IMRT (n=48), those treated with IG-IMRT (n=35) had a significantly lower incidence of grade ≥3 neutropenia (8.6% vs 27.1%; 2-sided χ<sup>2</sup>P=.035) and nonsignificantly lower incidence of grade ≥3 leukopenia (25.7% vs 41.7%; P=.13) and any grade ≥3 hematologic toxicity (31.4% vs 43.8%; P=.25).

We aimed to determine the validity of this technique in women with early-stage cervical cancer. We retrospectively reviewed women with early-stage cervical cancer who underwent SLN mapping followed by complete pelvic lymphadenectomy as part of initial surgical management from August 1997 through October 2015. All modes of surgical approach were included. Lymphatic mapping was performed using blue dye, technetium-99m sulfur colloid (Tc-99), and/or indocyanine green (ICG). We determined SLN detection rates, sensitivity and negative predictive value. One hundred eighty-eight patients were included, and 35 (19%) had lymph node metastases. At least one SLN was identified in 170 patients (90%), and bilateral SLNs were identified in 117 patients (62%). The majority of SLNs (83%) were found in the pelvis. There was no difference in detection rates between mapping agents, surgical approach, patients with and without prior conization or between patients with tumors <2cm and ≥2cm. The detection rate for bilateral SLNs was significantly lower in women with body mass index (BMI)>30kg/m<sup>2</sup> than in women with lower BMI (p=0.03).

Potential immunotherapy targets in recurrent cervical cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2017-02-21,"Our objective was to characterize the intra and peritumoral immune profile in recurrent cervical cancers to identify rational immunotherapy targets. Archival pelvic exenteration specimens were examined using a validated multiplex immuno-fluorescent panel of antibodies against cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8), cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68), forkhead box P3 (FoxP3), programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1, N=28). Clinical data were abstracted from the electronic medical record. Cytotoxic T cells, macrophages, and regulatory T cells were found in higher densities in peritumoral stroma (CD8+ density 497.7 vs 83.5, p<0.0001, CD68+ density 345.0 vs 196.7, p=0.04, FoxP3+ density 214.5 vs 35.6, p<0.0001). Antigen experienced T cells (PD1+) were higher in peritumoral compared to tumor tissue (median normalized fluorescence intensity 0.05 vs 0.0085, p<0.001). Although there was a higher median density of intratumoral cytotoxic T cells and macrophages compared to regulatory T cells (median density CD8+ 83.5 vs 35.6, p<0.05, median density 196.7 vs 35.6, p<0.05), the presence of macrophages correlated with the presence of regulatory T cells in tumors (r=0.58, p=0.001).

Longitudinal Changes in Active Bone Marrow for Cervical Cancer Patients Treated With Concurrent Chemoradiation Therapy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2016-11-29,"To quantify longitudinal changes in active bone marrow (ABM) distributions within unirradiated (extrapelvic) and irradiated (pelvic) bone marrow (BM) in cervical cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT). We sampled 39 cervical cancer patients treated with CRT, of whom 25 were treated with concurrent cisplatin (40 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and 14 were treated with cisplatin (40 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) plus gemcitabine (50-125 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) (C/G). Patients underwent <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic/computed tomographic imaging at baseline and 1.5 to 6.0 months after treatment. ABM was defined as the subvolume of bone with standardized uptake value (SUV) above the mean SUV of the total bone. The primary aim was to measure the compensatory response, defined as the change in the log of the ratio of extrapelvic versus pelvic ABM percentage from baseline to after treatment. We also quantified the change in the proportion of ABM and mean SUV in pelvic and extrapelvic BM using a 2-sided paired t test. We observed a significant increase in the overall extrapelvic compensatory response after CRT (0.381; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.312, 0.449) and separately in patients treated with cisplatin (0.429; 95% CI: 0.340, 0.517) and C/G (0.294; 95% CI: 0.186, 0.402). We observed a trend toward higher compensatory response in patients treated with cisplatin compared with C/G (P=.057). Pelvic ABM percentage was reduced after CRT both in patients receiving cisplatin (P<.001) and in those receiving C/G (P<.001), whereas extrapelvic ABM percentage was increased in patients receiving cisplatin (P<.001) and C/G (P<.001). The mean SUV in pelvic structures was lower after CRT with both cisplatin (P<.001) and C/G (P<.001). The mean SUV appeared lower in extrapelvic structures after CRT in patients treated with C/G (P=.076) but not with cisplatin (P=.942). We also observed that older age and more intense chemotherapy regimens were correlated with a decreased compensatory response on multivariable analysis. In patients treated with C/G, mean pelvic bone marrow dose was found to be negatively correlated with the compensatory response. Patients have differing subacute compensatory responses after CRT, owing to variable recovery in unirradiated marrow. Intensive chemotherapy regimens appear to decrease the extrapelvic compensatory response, which may lead to increased hematologic toxicity.",Controlled Clinical Trial,1148.0,9.0,To quantify longitudinal changes in active marrow ABM distributions within unirradiated extrapelvic and irradiated pelvic marrow BM in cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiation therapy CRT We sampled 39 cancer patients treated with CRT of whom 25 were treated with concurrent cisplatin 40 mg/m sup 2 /sup and 14 were treated with cisplatin 40 mg/m sup 2 /sup plus gemcitabine 50-125 mg/m sup 2 /sup C/G Patients underwent sup 18 /sup F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic/computed tomographic imaging at baseline and 1.5 to 6.0 months after treatment ABM was defined as the subvolume of with standardized uptake value SUV above the mean SUV of the total The primary aim was to measure the compensatory response defined as the change in the log of the ratio of extrapelvic versus pelvic ABM percentage from baseline to after treatment We also quantified the change in the proportion of ABM and mean SUV in pelvic and extrapelvic BM using a 2-sided paired t test We observed a significant increase in the overall extrapelvic compensatory response after CRT 0.381 95 confidence interval CI 0.312 0.449 and separately in patients treated with cisplatin 0.429 95 CI 0.340 0.517 and C/G 0.294 95 CI 0.186 0.402 We observed a trend toward higher compensatory response in patients treated with cisplatin compared with C/G P=.057 Pelvic ABM percentage was reduced after CRT both in patients receiving cisplatin P .001 and in those receiving C/G P .001 whereas extrapelvic ABM percentage was increased in patients receiving cisplatin P .001 and C/G P .001 The mean SUV in pelvic structures was lower after CRT with both cisplatin P .001 and C/G P .001 The mean SUV appeared lower in extrapelvic structures after CRT in patients treated with C/G P=.076 but not with cisplatin P=.942 We also observed that older age and more intense chemotherapy regimens were correlated with a decreased compensatory response on multivariable analysis In patients treated with C/G mean pelvic marrow dose was found to be negatively correlated with the compensatory response Patients have differing subacute compensatory responses after CRT owing to variable recovery in unirradiated marrow Intensive chemotherapy regimens appear to decrease the extrapelvic compensatory response which may lead to increased hematologic toxicity,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[6, 3091, 2380, 400, 4, 544, 581, 14380, 4477, 262, 11306, 12070, 2, 2398, 1110, 581, 1246, 4, 12, 7, 73, 5, 750, 975, 36, 1089, 21, 5919, 587, 12, 7, 73, 5, 1089, 1, 953, 243, 11, 73, 5, 750, 540, 327, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 2, 213, 11, 73, 5, 540, 327, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 349, 679, 212, 1731, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 256, 499, 7, 208, 172, 203, 172, 1068, 4085, 1900, 1799, 6158, 1220, 6158, 270, 28, 330, 2, 14, 33, 6, 49, 13, 53, 50, 24, 14380, 10, 395, 22, 3, 24103, 1, 5, 1670, 1135, 549, 2217, 2090, 3, 313, 2217, 1, 3, 181, 3, 86, 1130, 10, 6, 1463, 3, 7084, 51, 395, 22, 3, 707, 4, 3, 1066, 1, 3, 197, 1, 12070, 185, 1110, 14380, 1150, 29, 330, 6, 50, 24, 21, 120, 2790, 3, 707, 4, 3, 920, 1, 14380, 2, 313, 2217, 4, 1110, 2, 12070, 1246, 75, 8, 18, 1689, 2355, 102, 412, 21, 164, 8, 93, 344, 4, 3, 63, 12070, 7084, 51, 50, 1089, 13, 10155, 48, 307, 268, 58, 13, 8187, 13, 8865, 2, 3582, 4, 7, 73, 5, 540, 13, 8406, 48, 58, 13, 7264, 13, 11100, 2, 256, 499, 13, 8375, 48, 58, 13, 5869, 13, 9422, 21, 164, 8, 853, 1317, 142, 7084, 51, 4, 7, 73, 5, 540, 72, 5, 256, 499, 19, 10807, 1110, 14380, 1150, 10, 405, 50, 1089, 110, 4, 7, 357, 540, 19, 144, 2, 4, 135, 357, 256, 499, 19, 144, 547, 12070, 14380, 1150, 10, 101, 4, 7, 357, 540, 19, 144, 2, 256, 499, 19, 144, 3, 313, 2217, 4, 1110, 2414, 10, 280, 50, 1089, 5, 110, 540, 19, 144, 2, 256, 499, 19, 144, 3, 313, 2217, 2121, 280, 4, 12070, 2414, 50, 1089, 4, 7, 73, 5, 256, 499, 19, 13973, 84, 44, 5, 540, 19, 19784, 21, 120, 164, 17, 434, 89, 2, 80, 3933, 56, 472, 11, 438, 5, 8, 340, 7084, 51, 23, 658, 65, 4, 7, 73, 5, 256, 499, 313, 1110, 581, 61, 10, 204, 6, 40, 2723, 438, 5, 3, 7084, 51, 7, 47, 5276, 15181, 7084, 253, 50, 1089, 3421, 6, 1347, 1602, 4, 11306, 581, 1686, 56, 472, 1322, 6, 775, 3, 12070, 7084, 51, 92, 68, 1122, 6, 101, 813, 155]",2325.0,28244416,117

METHODS All patients treated with SF-SRS for primary or metastatic spine tumors between January 2004 and May 2013 and referred to the Rehabilitation Medicine Service for evaluation and treatment of neuromuscular, musculoskeletal, or functional impairments or pain were retrospectively identified. RESULTS Five hundred fifty-seven SF-SRS treatments in 447 patients resulted in 14 PNS injuries in 13 patients. All injures resulted from SF-SRS delivered to the cervical or lumbosacral spine at 2400 cGy. The overall percentage of SF-SRS treatments resulting in PNS injury was 2.5%, increasing to 4.5% when the thoracic spine was excluded from analysis. The median time to symptom onset following SF-SRS was 10 months (range 4-32 months). The plexus (cervical, brachial, and/or lumbosacral) was affected clinically and/or electrophysiologically in 12 (86%) of 14 cases, the nerve root in 2 (14%) of 14, and both in 6 (43%) of 14 cases.

TRAF3/CYLD mutations identify a distinct subset of human papillomavirus-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2017-03-13,"The incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated (HPV-positive) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) of the oropharynx has dramatically increased over the last decade and continues to rise. Newly diagnosed HPV-positive HNSCCs in the United States currently outnumber any other HPV-associated cancers, including cervical cancer. Despite introduction of the HPV vaccine, the epidemic of HPV-positive HNSCC is expected to continue for approximately 60 years. Compared with patients who have tobacco-associated HNSCC, those who have HPV-positive HNSCC have better overall survival and response to treatment. Current treatment, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy, is associated with lifelong morbidity, and there are limited treatments and no curative options for patients who develop recurrent metastatic disease. Therapeutic de-escalation (decreased radiation dose) is being tested through clinical trials; however, those studies select patients based solely on tumor and patient smoking characteristics. Mechanisms of HPV-driven carcinogenesis in HNSCC are not well understood, which limits new therapeutic strategies and hinders the appropriate selection of patients for de-escalation therapy. The authors analyzed HNSCC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify molecular characteristics that correlate with outcomes and integration status of the HPV genome. The current investigations identified a subset of HPV-positive HNSCCs with mutations in the genes TRAF3 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3) and CYLD (cylindromatosis lysine 63 deubiquitinase). Defects in TRAF3 and CYLD correlated with the activation of transcriptional factor nuclear factor κB, episomal HPV status of tumors, and improved patient survival.

miR-519 suppresses nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell proliferation by targeting oncogene URG4/URGCP.,Life sciences,Life Sci.,2017-03-16,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most common malignant tumor in Southeast Asia, its regulatory mechanism is still to be understood. miR-519 inhibits the progression of several tumors, including cervical cancer, ovarian cancer and gastric cancer. But its role in NPC hasn't been studied. In present study, we found miR-519 was downregulated in NPC cells, its overexpression inhibited NPC cell proliferation and arrested cell cycle at G0/G1 phase, while its knockdown promoted NPC cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. An oncogene URG4/URGCP (upregulated gene-4/upregulator of cell proliferation) was the target of miR-519, URG4 was upregulated in NPC cells, miR-519 inhibited URG4 expression by directly binding to the 3'UTR of URG4. miR-519 inhibited Cyclin D1 expression and the phosphorylation level of Rb, and increased p21 and p27 expression, confirming miR-519 blocked G1/S transition. Moreover, miR-519 level was negative correlated with URG4 level in NPC tissues.

Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with or without surgery for patients with resectable esophageal cancer: An analysis of the National Cancer Data Base.,Cancer,Cancer,2017-05-02,"Patients with resectable esophageal cancer (rEC) are managed with either concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery (CRSx) or concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone (cCR). To the authors' knowledge, there is insufficient evidence comparing the overall survival of patients treated with these 2 options. The National Cancer Data Base was queried for rEC cases diagnosed from 2003 through 2011. Patients with previous cancers, cervical rEC, clinical stage T1N0 disease, or metastasis were excluded. cCR was defined as radiotherapy administered within 30 days of chemotherapy. CRSx was defined as cCR followed by esophagectomy within 90 days. Overall survival was compared using Kaplan-Meier methods, propensity score matching, and extended Cox proportional hazards models. Of the 11,122 eligible patients, 8091 (72.7%) received cCR and 3031 (27.3%) received CRSx. The odds of receiving CRSx were higher among patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage II disease (vs stage III), adenocarcinoma (vs squamous cell carcinoma), lesions of the lower one-third of the esophagus, private insurance, and those living >25 miles from the treating facility or in areas with a higher median income or a greater percentage of high school-educated residents. Patients aged >70 years, female patients, African-American patients, those with ≥2 comorbidities, or those treated at community programs were more likely to receive cCR.

Genotype-specific methylation of HPV in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,Journal of gynecologic oncology,J Gynecol Oncol,2017-07-01,"Hypermethylation of human papillomavirus (HPV) and host genes has been reported in cervical cancer. However, the degree of methylation of different HPV types relative to the severity of the cervical lesions remains controversial. Studies of the degree of methylation associated with the host gene and the HPV genome to the severity of cervical lesions are rare. We examined the association of methylation status between host genes and late gene 1 (L1) regions of HPV16, 18, 52, and 58 in cervical brushings. Cervical brushings from 147 HPV-infected patients were obtained. The samples comprised normal (n=28), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1 (n=45), CIN2 (n=13), and CIN3/carcinoma in situ (n=61). The methylation status of HPV and host genes was measured using bisulfite pyrosequencing and quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The degree of methylation of L1 in HPV16, 18, and 52 was associated with the severity of the cervical lesion. In HPV52, C-phosphate-G (CpG) sites 6368m, 6405m, and 6443m showed significantly higher methylation in lesions ≥CIN3 (p=0.005, 0.003, and 0.026, respectively). Methylation of most HPV types except HPV52 (r<-0.1) was positively correlated with the degree of methylation of host genes including PAX1 and SOX1 (0.4≤r≤0.7). Combining HPV methylation with PAX1 methylation improved the clustering for ≥CIN2.

Evaluating Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy Relative to Passive Scattering Proton Therapy for Increased Vertebral Column Sparing in Craniospinal Irradiation in Growing Pediatric Patients.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2017-02-01,"At present, proton craniospinal irradiation (CSI) for growing children is delivered to the whole vertebral body (WVB) to avoid asymmetric growth. We aimed to demonstrate the feasibility and potential clinical benefit of delivering vertebral body sparing (VBS) versus WVB CSI with passively scattered (PS) and intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) in growing children treated for medulloblastoma. Five plans were generated for medulloblastoma patients, who had been previously treated with CSI PS proton radiation therapy: (1) single posteroanterior (PA) PS field covering the WVB (PS-PA-WVB); (2) single PA PS field that included only the thecal sac in the target volume (PS-PA-VBS); (3) single PA IMPT field covering the WVB (IMPT-PA-WVB); (4) single PA IMPT field, target volume including thecal sac only (IMPT-PA-VBS); and (5) 2 posterior-oblique (-35°, +35°) IMPT fields, with the target volume including the thecal sac only (IMPT2F-VBS). For all cases, 23.4 Gy (relative biologic effectiveness [RBE]) was prescribed to 95% of the spinal canal. The dose, linear energy transfer, and variable-RBE-weighted dose distributions were calculated for all plans using the tool for particle simulation, version 2, Monte Carlo system. IMPT VBS techniques efficiently spared the anterior vertebral bodies (AVBs), even when accounting for potential higher variable RBE predicted by linear energy transfer distributions. Assuming an RBE of 1.1, the V10 Gy(RBE) decreased from 100% for the WVB techniques to 59.5% to 76.8% for the cervical, 29.9% to 34.6% for the thoracic, and 20.6% to 25.1% for the lumbar AVBs, and the V20 Gy(RBE) decreased from 99.0% to 17.8% to 20.0% for the cervical, 7.2% to 7.6% for the thoracic, and 4.0% to 4.6% for the lumbar AVBs when IMPT VBS techniques were applied. The corresponding percentages for the PS VBS technique were higher.

"Isolation, Detection, and Quantification of Cancer Biomarkers in HPV-Associated Malignancies.",Scientific reports,Sci Rep,2017-06-12,"Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been recognized as the main etiologic factor in the development of various cancers including penile, vulva, oropharyngeal and cervical cancers. In the development of cancer, persistent HPV infections induce E6 and E7 oncoproteins, which promote cell proliferation and carcinogenesis resulting elevated levels of host antibodies (e.g., anti-HPV16 E7 antibody). Currently, these cancers are clinically diagnosed using invasive biopsy-based tests, which are performed only in centralized labs by experienced clinical staff using time-consuming and expensive tools and technologies. Therefore, these obstacles constrain their utilization at primary care clinics and in remote settings, where resources are limited. Here, we present a rapid, inexpensive, reliable, easy-to-use, customized immunoassay platform following a microfluidic filter device to detect and quantify anti-HPV16 E7 antibodies from whole blood as a non-invasive assisting technology for diagnosis of HPV-associated malignancies, especially, at primary healthcare and remote settings. The platform can detect and quantify anti-HPV16 E7 antibody down to 2.87 ng/mL. We further validated our immunoassay in clinical patient samples and it provided significantly high responses as compared to control samples.

Medicaid Expansions and Cervical Cancer Screening for Low-Income Women.,Health services research,Health Serv Res,2017-06-30,"Medicaid coverage for low-income women may play an important role in ensuring access to preventive care. This study examines how Medicaid eligibility expansions to nonelderly adults impact cervical cancer screening among low-income women.

The primary outcome of interest is whether women in the relevant guideline consistent age range reported having a Pap test in the previous year. We use a difference-in-differences approach with matched treatment and comparison states and a simulated eligibility approach based on a continuous measure of Medicaid generosity. Our results indicate that cervical cancer screening increased among low-income women in expansion states relative to comparison states. Increases in screening rates are largest among low-income Hispanic women. Medicaid expansions during the period from 2000 to 2010 were associated with improved cervical cancer screening rates, which is critical for early cervical cancer detection and prevention of cancer morbidity and mortality in women.

"Bevacizumab for advanced cervical cancer: final overall survival and adverse event analysis of a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial (Gynecologic Oncology Group 240).","Lancet (London, England)",Lancet,2017-07-27,"On Aug 14, 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the antiangiogenesis drug bevacizumab for women with advanced cervical cancer on the basis of improved overall survival (OS) after the second interim analysis (in 2012) of 271 deaths in the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) 240 trial. In this study, we report the prespecified final analysis of the primary objectives, OS and adverse events. In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients with metastatic, persistent, or recurrent cervical carcinoma from 81 centres in the USA, Canada, and Spain. Inclusion criteria included a GOG performance status score of 0 or 1; adequate renal, hepatic, and bone marrow function; adequately anticoagulated thromboembolism; a urine protein to creatinine ratio of less than 1; and measurable disease. Patients who had received chemotherapy for recurrence and those with non-healing wounds or active bleeding conditions were ineligible. We randomly allocated patients 1:1:1:1 (blocking used; block size of four) to intravenous chemotherapy of either cisplatin (50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1 or 2) plus paclitaxel (135 mg/m<sup>2</sup> or 175 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1) or topotecan (0·75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1-3) plus paclitaxel (175 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1) with or without intravenous bevacizumab (15 mg/kg on day 1) in 21 day cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, voluntary withdrawal by the patient, or complete response. We stratified randomisation by GOG performance status (0 vs 1), previous radiosensitising platinum-based chemotherapy, and disease status (recurrent or persistent vs metastatic). We gave treatment open label. Primary outcomes were OS (analysed in the intention-to-treat population) and adverse events (analysed in all patients who received treatment and submitted adverse event information), assessed at the second interim and final analysis by the masked Data and Safety Monitoring Board. The cutoff for final analysis was 450 patients with 346 deaths. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00803062. Between April 6, 2009, and Jan 3, 2012, we enrolled 452 patients (225 [50%] in the two chemotherapy-alone groups and 227 [50%] in the two chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups). By March 7, 2014, 348 deaths had occurred, meeting the prespecified cutoff for final analysis. The chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups continued to show significant improvement in OS compared with the chemotherapy-alone groups: 16·8 months in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups versus 13·3 months in the chemotherapy-alone groups (hazard ratio 0·77 [95% CI 0·62-0·95]; p=0·007). Final OS among patients not receiving previous pelvic radiotherapy was 24·5 months versus 16·8 months (0·64 [0·37-1·10]; p=0·11). Postprogression OS was not significantly different between the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups (8·4 months) and chemotherapy-alone groups (7·1 months; 0·83 [0·66-1·05]; p=0·06). Fistula (any grade) occurred in 32 (15%) of 220 patients in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups (all previously irradiated) versus three (1%) of 220 in the chemotherapy-alone groups (all previously irradiated). Grade 3 fistula developed in 13 (6%) versus one (<1%). No fistulas resulted in surgical emergencies, sepsis, or death. The benefit conferred by incorporation of bevacizumab is sustained with extended follow-up as evidenced by the overall survival curves remaining separated. After progression while receiving bevacizumab, we did not observe a negative rebound effect (ie, shorter survival after bevacizumab is stopped than after chemotherapy alone is stopped). These findings represent proof-of-concept of the efficacy and tolerability of antiangiogenesis therapy in advanced cervical cancer.

Prospective screening with the validated Opioid Risk Tool demonstrates gynecologic oncology patients are at low risk for opioid misuse.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2017-08-12,"To characterize risk for opioid misuse among gynecologic oncology patients. The Opioid Risk Tool (ORT), a validated screen for opioid misuse risk, was administered to a convenience sample of patients with gynecologic cancer receiving opioid prescriptions in gynecologic oncology or palliative care clinics from January 2012-June 2016. Demographic and clinical information was abstracted on chart review. The primary outcome was ORT risk level (low vs. moderate or high). Chi-square tests were performed for categorical variables. A total of 118 women were screened. Most women were Caucasian (79%) with a median age of 57years. Ovarian cancer patients comprised 46% of the cohort with fewer endometrial (25%), cervical (23%), vulvar (4%), and vaginal (2%) cancer patients. The median ORT score was 1.0 (range, 0-10) out of a possible 26. Overall, 87% of patients were categorized as low-risk for opioid misuse, 7% as moderate-risk, and 6% as high-risk.

Patterns of uptake of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL in peripheral ganglia.,Annals of nuclear medicine,Ann Nucl Med,2017-08-22,"Radiotracers targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) have increasingly been recognized as showing uptake in a number of normal structures, anatomic variants, and non-prostate-cancer pathologies. We aimed to explore the frequency and degree of uptake in peripheral ganglia in patients undergoing PET with the PSMA-targeted agent <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL. A total of 98 patients who underwent <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging were retrospectively analyzed. This included 76 men with prostate cancer (PCa) and 22 patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC; 13 men, 9 women). Scans were evaluated for uptake in the cervical, stellate, celiac, lumbar and sacral ganglia. Maximum standardized uptake value corrected to body weight (SUV<sub>max</sub>), and maximum standardized uptake value corrected to lean body mass (SUL<sub>max</sub>) were recorded for all ganglia with visible uptake above background. Ganglia-to-background ratios were calculated by dividing the SUV<sub>max</sub> and SUL<sub>max</sub> values by the mean uptake in the ascending aorta (Aorta<sub>mean</sub>) and the right gluteus muscle (Gluteus<sub>mean</sub>). Overall, 95 of 98 (96.9%) patients demonstrated uptake in at least one of the evaluated peripheral ganglia. With regard to the PCa cohort, the most frequent sites of radiotracer accumulation were lumbar ganglia (55/76, 72.4%), followed by the cervical ganglia (51/76, 67.1%). Bilateral uptake was found in the majority of cases [lumbar 44/55 (80%) and cervical 30/51 (58.8%)]. Additionally, discernible radiotracer uptake was recorded in 50/76 (65.8%) of the analyzed stellate ganglia and in 45/76 (59.2%) of the celiac ganglia, whereas only 5/76 (6.6%) of the sacral ganglia demonstrated <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL accumulation. Similar findings were observed for patients with RCC, with the most frequent locations of radiotracer uptake in both the lumbar (20/22, 90.9%) and cervical ganglia (19/22, 86.4%). No laterality preference was found in mean PSMA-ligand uptake for either the PCa or RCC cohorts. As PSMA-targeted agents become more widely disseminated, the patterns of uptake in structures that are not directly relevant to patients' cancers must be understood. This is the first systematic evaluation of the uptake of <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL in ganglia demonstrating a general trend with a descending frequency of radiotracer accumulation in lumbar, cervical, stellate, celiac, and sacral ganglia.

Immunotherapy in Gynecologic Cancers: Are We There Yet?,Current treatment options in oncology,Curr Treat Options Oncol,2017-08-24,"Immune-targeted therapies have demonstrated durable responses in many tumor types with limited treatment options and poor overall prognosis. This has led to enthusiasm for expanding such therapies to other tumor types including gynecologic malignancies. The use of immunotherapy in gynecologic malignancies is in the early stages and is an active area of ongoing clinical research. Both cancer vaccines and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy continue to be extensively studied in gynecologic malignancies. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, in particular, hold promising potential in specific subsets of endometrial cancer that express microsatellite instability. The key to successful treatment with immunotherapy involves identification of the subgroup of patients that will derive benefit. The number of ongoing trials in cervical, ovarian, and endometrial cancer will help to recognize these patients and make treatment more directed. Additionally, a number of studies are combining immunotherapy with standard treatment options and will help to determine combinations that will enhance responses to standard therapy. Overall, there is much enthusiasm for immunotherapy approaches in gynecologic malignancies. However, the emerging data shows that with the exception of microsatellite unstable tumors, the use of single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitors is associated with response rates of 10-15%.

American Brachytherapy Society recurrent carcinoma of the endometrium task force patterns of care and review of the literature.,Brachytherapy,Brachytherapy,2017-09-06,"The purpose of this American Brachytherapy Society task force is to present a literature review and patterns of care by a panel of experts for the management of vaginal recurrence of endometrial cancer. In 2016, the American Brachytherapy Society Board selected a panel of experts in gynecologic brachytherapy to update our current state of knowledge for managing vaginal recurrence of endometrial cancer. Practice patterns were evaluated via an online survey and clinical updates occurred through a combination of literature review and clinical experience and/or expertise. There are various retrospective series of patients treated with radiation for vaginal recurrence of endometrial cancer, which include a varied group of patients, multiple treatment techniques, and a range of total doses and demonstrate a wide scope of local control and overall survival outcomes. In the era of image-guided brachytherapy, high local control rates with low significant late-term morbidities can be achieved. Lower rates of local control and higher late-term toxicity are reported in the retreatment setting. In patients with no previous history of radiation treatment, external beam radiation therapy followed by brachytherapy boost should be used.

Genistein Induces Alterations of Epigenetic Modulatory Signatures in Human Cervical Cancer Cells.,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,2018-01-01,"Epidemiological studies indicate that diet rich in fruits and vegetables is associated with decreased cancer risk thereby indicating that dietary polyphenols can be potential chemo-preventive agents. The reversible nature of epigenetic modifications makes them a favorable target for cancer prevention. Polyphenols have been shown to reverse aberrant epigenetic patterns by targeting the regulatory enzymes, DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). In vitro and in silico studies of DNMTs and HDACs were planned to examine genistein's role as a natural epigenetic modifier in human cervical cancer cells, HeLa. Expression of the tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) [MGMT, RARβ, p21, E-cadherin, DAPK1] as well the methylation status of their promoters were examined alongwith the activity levels of DNMT and HDAC enzymes after treatment with genistein. Expression of DNMTs and HDACs was also studied. In-silico studies were performed to determine the interaction of genistein with DNMTs and HDACs. Genistein treatment significantly reduced the expression and enzymatic activity of both DNMTs and HDACs in a time-dependent way. Molecular modeling data suggest that genistein can interact with various members of DNMT and HDAC families and support genistein mediated inhibition of their activity. Timedependent exposure of genistein reversed the promoter region methylation of the TSGs and re-established their expression. In this study, we find that genistein is able to reinstate the expression of the TSGs studied by inhibiting the action of DNMTs and HDACs. This shows that genistein could be an important arsenal in the development of epigenetic based cancer therapy.",Journal Article,750.0,15.0,Epidemiological studies indicate that diet rich in fruits and vegetables is associated with decreased cancer risk thereby indicating that dietary polyphenols can be potential chemo-preventive agents The reversible nature of epigenetic modifications makes them a favorable target for cancer prevention Polyphenols have been shown to reverse aberrant epigenetic patterns by targeting the regulatory enzymes DNA methyltransferases DNMTs and histone deacetylases HDACs In vitro and in silico studies of DNMTs and HDACs were planned to examine genistein 's role as a natural epigenetic modifier in human cancer cells HeLa Expression of the tumour suppressor genes TSGs MGMT RARβ p21 E-cadherin DAPK1 as well the methylation status of their promoters were examined alongwith the activity levels of DNMT and HDAC enzymes after treatment with genistein Expression of DNMTs and HDACs was also studied In-silico studies were performed to determine the interaction of genistein with DNMTs and HDACs Genistein treatment significantly reduced the expression and enzymatic activity of both DNMTs and HDACs in a time-dependent way Molecular modeling data suggest that genistein can interact with various members of DNMT and HDAC families and support genistein mediated inhibition of their activity Timedependent exposure of genistein reversed the promoter region methylation of the TSGs and re-established their expression In this study we find that genistein is able to reinstate the expression of the TSGs studied by inhibiting the action of DNMTs and HDACs This shows that genistein could be an important arsenal in the development of epigenetic based cancer therapy,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[4614, 94, 1008, 17, 2453, 3697, 4, 7896, 2, 6024, 16, 41, 5, 340, 12, 43, 2267, 1716, 17, 2013, 14831, 122, 40, 174, 3341, 3494, 183, 3, 2786, 2202, 1, 1418, 2916, 4677, 1370, 8, 913, 283, 9, 12, 1070, 14831, 47, 85, 443, 6, 1772, 1898, 1418, 764, 20, 529, 3, 1253, 3039, 261, 11494, 16486, 2, 1508, 9758, 7803, 4, 439, 2, 4, 6648, 94, 1, 16486, 2, 7803, 11, 1465, 6, 1004, 7395, 292, 200, 22, 8, 1504, 1418, 8833, 4, 171, 12, 37, 8466, 55, 1, 3, 770, 1245, 214, 13876, 2661, 50607, 2657, 563, 2154, 11503, 22, 149, 3, 569, 156, 1, 136, 4347, 11, 409, 50608, 3, 128, 148, 1, 10229, 2, 2654, 3039, 50, 24, 5, 7395, 55, 1, 16486, 2, 7803, 10, 120, 656, 4, 6648, 94, 11, 173, 6, 223, 3, 915, 1, 7395, 5, 16486, 2, 7803, 7395, 24, 97, 405, 3, 55, 2, 5226, 128, 1, 110, 16486, 2, 7803, 4, 8, 98, 470, 2255, 219, 2057, 74, 309, 17, 7395, 122, 4491, 5, 747, 1684, 1, 10229, 2, 2654, 1954, 2, 538, 7395, 517, 297, 1, 136, 128, 71243, 645, 1, 7395, 3682, 3, 973, 1053, 569, 1, 3, 13876, 2, 1491, 635, 136, 55, 4, 26, 45, 21, 2469, 17, 7395, 16, 1665, 6, 71244, 3, 55, 1, 3, 13876, 656, 20, 2062, 3, 1578, 1, 16486, 2, 7803, 26, 1949, 17, 7395, 359, 40, 35, 305, 13325, 4, 3, 193, 1, 1418, 90, 12, 36]",1654.0,28925878,0

We retrospectively reviewed the records of 155 women with stage I (98), II (11), or III (46) UC who underwent total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at our institution between 1990 and 2011. Survival rates were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed. Seventy-six patients (49%) received radiation therapy: 38 (50%) had vaginal cuff brachytherapy (VBT) alone and 38 had external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) ± VBT. Seventy patients (45%) received chemotherapy (12 concurrent, 49 adjuvant, 9 both). The 5-year overall survival rate was 48.6% (stage I, 53.8%; II, 30.0%; and III, 42.5%). The disease-specific survival (DSS) rate was 57.2% (stage I, 60.9%; II, 44.4%; and III, 51.8%). Patients treated with EBRT had a higher 5-year pelvic disease control rate (88.3%) than did patients treated with VBT only (67.4%) or no radiation (71.2%; P = 0.04). In stage III patients, EBRT was associated with higher 5-year pelvic disease control (90.0% vs 55.5%, P = 0.046), DSS (64.6% vs 46.4%, P = 0.13), and overall survival (64.6% vs 34.0%, P = 0.04) rates. For all 155 patients, age at least 65 years, cervical involvement, and lymph vascular space invasion were correlated with lower DSS on univariate and multivariate analyses. In addition, treatment with concurrent chemoradiation therapy was independently associated with a higher DSS rate on multivariate analysis.

Mutational signatures efficiently identify different mutational processes underlying cancers with similar somatic mutation spectra.,Mutation research,Mutat. Res.,2017-07-19,"Compared to analyzing mutations with conventional spectra, deciphering mutational signatures provides much greater resolution of biological processes that generate somatic mutations during cancer development. Previous studies of bladder urothelial cancer (BLCA) and cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC) mutational signatures failed to uncover different mutational processes underlying the two cancers, which diminishes the capability of mutational signature to differentiate between the two cancers. In this study, we deciphered and compared the mutational signatures of BLCA and CESC. Four BLCA mutational signatures were deciphered from 37,098 somatic mutations of 130 exomes. Five CESC mutational signatures were deciphered from 44,206 somatic mutations of 194 exomes. Three BLCA mutational signatures were very similar to the three CESC signatures. These mutational signatures exhibited common endogenous mutational processes during BLCA and CESC development. The respective BLCA and CESC mutational signature 4 revealed the role of viral infection in both cancers. Noticeably, CESC mutational signature 4 is a novel one that has not been described in other studies. In summary, we have demonstrated the similarities and differences between BLCA and CESC by deciphering mutational signatures.

Outcomes and patterns of relapse after definitive radiation therapy for oligometastatic cervical cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2017-10-28,"Survival rates for women with metastatic cervical cancer are low, with limited management options. Definitive radiation therapy (RT) for oligometastatic disease has led to prolonged survival in other malignancies, but this approach has yet to be systematically studied for cervical cancer. We evaluated 38 patients who received definitive RT to oligometastatic sites of cervical cancer at a single institution from 2002 to 2015. Patients presented with synchronous (n=9) or metachronous (n=15) oligometastatic disease to supraclavicular (SCV) nodes, or with recurrent disease in mediastinum (n=10) or lung (n=7). Three patients were treated for both SCV and mediastinal sites, and six patients were treated for para-aortic or pelvic recurrences along with oligometastatic sites. Most received chemotherapy: induction (n=5), concurrent (n=24), or adjuvant (n=5). Outcomes were evaluated via Kaplan-Meier, and associations were examined via Cox proportional hazards modeling. Median follow-up was 35.2months (range 3.1-94.7). Median overall survival (OS) was 50.7months from end of RT, with 2-year and 3-year OS rates of 74% and 65%. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 21.7months, with 1-year and 2-year PFS rates of 63% and 48%. Of the 38 patients, 21 (55%) experienced progression, at a median time of 24.8months. There was one in-field failure. Other relapses occurred regionally (n=10) and distally (n=12), with two patients experiencing both. The most common site of recurrence following treatment of SCV disease was mediastinum (n=7). The incidence of grade≥3 toxicity from treatment of oligometastatic sites was <3%. Definitive RT to sites of oligometastatic cervical cancer can result in excellent local control, favorable outcomes, and even achieve long-term survival for carefully selected patients, with minimal RT-associated toxicity.",Journal Article,815.0,14.0,Survival rates for women with metastatic cancer are low with limited management options Definitive radiation therapy RT for oligometastatic disease has led to prolonged survival in other malignancies but this approach has yet to be systematically studied for cancer We evaluated 38 patients who received definitive RT to oligometastatic sites of cancer at a single institution from 2002 to 2015 Patients presented with synchronous n=9 or metachronous n=15 oligometastatic disease to supraclavicular SCV nodes or with recurrent disease in mediastinum n=10 or n=7 Three patients were treated for both SCV and mediastinal sites and six patients were treated for para-aortic or pelvic recurrences along with oligometastatic sites Most received chemotherapy induction n=5 concurrent n=24 or adjuvant n=5 Outcomes were evaluated via Kaplan-Meier and associations were examined via Cox proportional hazards modeling Median follow-up was 35.2months range 3.1-94.7 Median overall survival OS was 50.7months from end of RT with 2-year and 3-year OS rates of 74 and 65 Median progression-free survival PFS was 21.7months with 1-year and 2-year PFS rates of 63 and 48 Of the 38 patients 21 55 experienced progression at a median time of 24.8months There was one in-field failure Other relapses occurred regionally n=10 and distally n=12 with two patients experiencing both The most common site of recurrence following treatment of SCV disease was mediastinum n=7 The incidence of grade≥3 toxicity from treatment of oligometastatic sites was 3 Definitive RT to sites of oligometastatic cancer can result in excellent local control favorable outcomes and even achieve long-term survival for carefully selected patients with minimal RT-associated toxicity,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[25, 151, 9, 117, 5, 113, 12, 32, 154, 5, 383, 284, 838, 1057, 121, 36, 240, 9, 4101, 34, 71, 836, 6, 1069, 25, 4, 127, 441, 84, 26, 353, 71, 1145, 6, 40, 3390, 656, 9, 12, 21, 194, 519, 7, 54, 103, 1057, 240, 6, 4101, 633, 1, 12, 28, 8, 226, 731, 29, 1544, 6, 1483, 7, 917, 5, 2734, 78, 83, 15, 4796, 78, 167, 4101, 34, 6, 5804, 13661, 502, 15, 5, 387, 34, 4, 7156, 78, 79, 15, 78, 67, 169, 7, 11, 73, 9, 110, 13661, 2, 2626, 633, 2, 437, 7, 11, 73, 9, 4615, 3938, 15, 1110, 1593, 1510, 5, 4101, 633, 96, 103, 56, 504, 78, 33, 750, 78, 259, 15, 249, 78, 33, 123, 11, 194, 847, 876, 882, 2, 685, 11, 409, 847, 418, 831, 1017, 2057, 52, 166, 126, 10, 465, 15030, 184, 27, 14, 960, 67, 52, 63, 25, 118, 10, 212, 20665, 29, 396, 1, 240, 5, 18, 111, 2, 27, 111, 118, 151, 1, 794, 2, 556, 52, 91, 115, 25, 300, 10, 239, 20665, 5, 14, 111, 2, 18, 111, 300, 151, 1, 676, 2, 576, 1, 3, 519, 7, 239, 614, 592, 91, 28, 8, 52, 98, 1, 259, 29806, 125, 10, 104, 4, 1067, 496, 127, 3713, 489, 8183, 78, 79, 2, 17743, 78, 133, 5, 100, 7, 2985, 110, 3, 96, 186, 606, 1, 146, 366, 24, 1, 13661, 34, 10, 7156, 78, 67, 3, 287, 1, 14659, 155, 29, 24, 1, 4101, 633, 10, 27, 1057, 240, 6, 633, 1, 4101, 12, 122, 757, 4, 1503, 293, 182, 913, 123, 2, 871, 1359, 319, 337, 25, 9, 3900, 715, 7, 5, 1048, 240, 41, 155]",1740.0,29089122,153
3T multiparametric MRI-guided high-dose-rate combined intracavitary and interstitial adaptive brachytherapy for the treatment of cervical cancer with a novel split-ring applicator.,Brachytherapy,Brachytherapy,2017-10-31,"To evaluate the role of 3T-MRI-guided adaptive high-dose-rate (HDR) combined intracavitary and interstitial brachytherapy for cervical cancer using a novel intracavitary split-ring (ICSR) applicator adapter. We retrospectively reviewed all HDR brachytherapy cases from 2013 to 2015 using an ICSR applicator. Initial optimization was performed using 3T multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) series with an applicator in place. The mpMRI series were discretionarily acquired before subsequent fractions for possible target adaptation. When necessary, interstitial needles (ISNs) were inserted through a novel ICSR adapter or freehand. Dosimetric parameters, clinical outcomes, and toxicities were compared between groups. Seventeen patients were included, with a mean followup of 32 months. An mpMRI series preceded each initial fraction and 52.9% of patients underwent ≥1 additional pretreatment mpMRI. Among these subsequent fractions, the high-risk clinical target volume was reduced in 80% vs. 41% without pretreatment mpMRI. Five patients had ISN placement (seven insertions) to improve extracervical target coverage. Mean D<sub>90</sub> (Gy) per fraction to the high-risk clinical target volume and intermediate-risk clinical target volume with and without an ISN were 7.51 ± 1.07 vs. 6.14 ± 0.52 (p = 0.028) and 6.35 ± 0.75 vs. 5.21 ± 0.49 (p = 0.007), respectively. Mean fractional D<sub>2cc</sub> (Gy) for organs at risk was comparable. No Grades 3-4 toxicity was reported. Disease-free survival and local control for the ICSR-ISN and ICSR-alone groups were 29.8 months/80.0% and 31.2 months/83.3%, respectively. The mpMRI acquisition with ICSR applicator in place immediately before HDR brachytherapy for cervical cancer guided successful adaptive treatment optimization and delivery.

Skull base plasmacytoma: A unique case of POEMS syndrome with a plasmacytoma causing craniocervical instability.,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,J Clin Neurosci,2017-10-31,"Plasmacytomas, considered to be the solitary counterparts of multiple myeloma, are neoplastic monoclonal plasma cell proliferations within soft tissue or bone. Plasmacytomas often present as a collection of findings known as POEMS-syndrome (Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, M-Protein spike, and Skin changes). We present a report of a 47 yo male diagnosed with POEMS-syndrome secondary to a skull base plasmacytoma. The mass resulted in marked instability of the cranio-cervical junction due to bony erosion. Following an induction course of chemotherapy, he showed clinical improvement with a marked reduction in tumor size and underwent an autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant for systemic treatment of his POEMS-syndrome. Following completion of systemic treatment, he then underwent a definitive occipital-cervical fusion without complications. His neurologic exam upon dismissal was stable with subjective improvement in left upper extremity strength. Postoperative radiographs confirmed spinal alignment and pathological examination of a small biopsy from C1 revealed benign fibrous tissue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a skull-base plasmacytoma associated with POEMS-syndrome, causing cranio-cervical instability.

Serum Immune Profiling for Early Detection of Cervical Disease.,Theranostics,Theranostics,2017-08-23,"The most recent (2012) worldwide estimates from International Agency for Research on Cancer indicate that approximately 528,000 new cases and 270,000 deaths per year are attributed to cervical cancer worldwide. The disease is preventable with HPV vaccination and with early detection and treatment of pre-invasive cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, CIN. Antibodies (Abs) to HPV proteins are under investigation as potential biomarkers for early detection. To detect circulating HPV-specific IgG Abs, we developed programmable protein arrays (NAPPA) that display the proteomes of two low-risk HPV types (HPV6 and 11) and ten oncogenic high-risk HPV types (HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52 and 58). Arrays were probed with sera from women with CIN 0/I (n=78), CIN II/III (n=84), or invasive cervical cancer (ICC, n=83). Abs to any early (E) HPV protein were detected less frequently in women with CIN 0/I (23.7%) than women with CIN II/III (39.0%) and ICC (46.1%, p<0.04). Of the E Abs, anti-E7 Abs were the most frequently detected (6.6%, 19.5%, and 30.3%, respectively). The least frequently detected Abs were E1 and E2-Abs in CIN 0/I (1.3%) and E1-Abs in CIN II/III (1.2%) and ICC (7.9%).

Cancer incidence and mortality among young adults aged 20-39 years worldwide in 2012: a population-based study.,The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2017-10-27,"To date, the burden of cancer among young adults has rarely been studied in depth. Our aim was to describe the scale and profile of cancer incidence and mortality worldwide among 20-39 year-olds, highlighting major patterns by age, sex, development level, and geographical region. We did a population-based study to quantify the burden of young adult cancers worldwide. We defined young adult cancers as those occurring between the ages of 20 and 39 years because these individuals will have passed puberty and adolescence, but not yet experienced the effects of hormonal decline, immune response deterioration, or organ dysfunction associated with chronic health conditions. Global, regional, and country-specific (n=184) data estimates of the number of new cancer cases and cancer-associated deaths that occurred in 2012 among young adults were extracted in four 5-year bands from the International Agency for Research on Cancer's GLOBOCAN 2012 for all cancers combined and for 27 major types as defined by the International Classification of Disease, tenth revision. We report the number of new cancer cases and cancer-associated deaths overall and by sex alongside corresponding age-standardised rates (ASR) per 100 000 people per year. We also present results using four levels of the Human Development Index (HDI; low [least developed], medium, high, and very high [most developed]), which is a composite indicator for socioeconomic development comprising life expectancy, education, and gross national income. 975 396 new cancer cases and 358 392 cancer-associated deaths occurred among young adults worldwide in 2012, which equated to an ASR of 43·3 new cancer cases per 100 000 people per year and 15·9 cancer-associated deaths per 100 000 people per year. The burden was disproportionally greater among women and the most common cancer types overall in terms of new cases were female breast cancer, cervical cancer, thyroid cancer, leukaemia, and colorectal cancer; in terms of deaths, female breast cancer, liver cancer, leukaemia, and cervical cancer were the main contributors. When assessed by development level and geographical region, the cancer profile varied substantially; generally, the burden of infection-associated cancers was greater in regions under transition. Cancer incidence was elevated in very high-HDI regions compared with low-HDI regions (ASR 64·5 vs 46·2 cancer cases per 100 000 people per year); however, the mortality burden was 3 times higher in low-HDI regions (ASR 25·4 vs 9·2 cancer-associated deaths per 100 000 people per year), reflecting differences in cancer profiles and inferior outcomes. The global cancer burden among 20-39 year-olds differs from that seen in younger or older ages and varies substantially by age, sex, development level, and geographical region. Although the cancer burden is lower in this age group than that observed in older ages, the societal and economic effects remain great given the major effects of premature morbidity and mortality. Targeted surveillance, prevention, and treatment are needed to reduce the cancer burden in this underserved age group.

Predictors of quality of life improvement after surgery for metastatic tumors of the spine: prospective cohort study.,The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society,Spine J,2017-11-06,"Surgical decompression and stabilization followed by radiosurgery represents an effective method for local tumor control and neurologic preservation for patients with metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC). We have previously demonstrated improvement in health-related quality of life (HrQOL) after this combined modality treatment (""hybrid therapy""). The current analysis focuses on delineation of patient-specific prognostic factors predictive of HrQOL change after combined surgery-stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) treatment of MESCC. This is a prospective, single-center, cohort study. One hundred and eleven patients with MESCC who underwent separation surgery followed by SRS were included. Prognostic factors associated with improved patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. Patient-reported outcome tools, that is, Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Spine Tumor (MDASI-SP), both validated in the cancer population, were prospectively collected. Numeric prognostic factors were correlated with PRO measures using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Categorical prognostic factors were correlated with PRO measures using the Wilcoxon two-sample test (for two categories) or the Kruskal-Wallis test (for three or more categories). All statistical tests were two-sided with a level of significance <.05 for correlation of prognostic factors with PRO constructs and a level of significance <.0014 for correlation of prognostic factors with PRO items. Statistical analyses were done in SAS (version 9.4, Cary, NC, USA). One hundred and eleven patients were included in this analysis. Patients with lower preoperative Medical Research Council (MRC) motor scores experienced a greater decrease in symptom interference (BPI interference construct (p=.03) and individual functional measures including general activity (p=.001), walking (p=.001), and normal work (p=.006)). Lumbar location was associated with better outcomes than cervical or thoracic as noted on the BPI pain experience construct (p=.03) and MDASI-SP interference (p=.01) and core symptom (p=.002) constructs. Patients with American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scores of C or D benefit more than those with ASIA E on BPI interference construct (p=.04). Patients with higher Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores at presentation benefit more than those with low ECOG scores on MDASI-SP interference construct (p=.03). Women benefit more than men on BPI interference (p=.03) and pain experience (p=.04) constructs. Patients with prior spinal surgery at the current level of interest benefit less than those who are naïve surgical patients in MDASI-SP interference construct (p=.04). Delineation of patient characteristics associated with HrQOL improvement provides crucial information for patient selection, patient education, and setting treatment expectations.

Association of Ipilimumab With Safety and Antitumor Activity in Women With Metastatic or Recurrent Human Papillomavirus-Related Cervical Carcinoma.,JAMA oncology,JAMA Oncol,2018-07-12,"Based on evidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced immune evasion, immunotherapy may be an attractive strategy in cervical cancer. Ipilimumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), which acts to downregulate the T-cell immune response. To assess the safety and antitumor activity of ipilimumab in recurrent cervical cancer. A multicenter trial was designed for patients with metastatic cervical cancer (squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma) with measurable disease and progression after at least 1 line of platinum chemotherapy. A run-in safety cohort using ipilimumab, 3 mg/kg, every 21 days for 4 cycles in 6 patients was followed by a phase II cohort of ipilimumab, 10 mg/kg, every 21 days for 4 cycles and then 4 cycles of maintenance therapy every 12 weeks for patients demonstrating radiologic response or stabilization. Immune correlative studies were performed on peripheral blood before and after therapy on archival tissue and fresh tumor obtained prior to registration and 7 days after cycle 2. The study was conducted from December 3, 2012, to September 15, 2014. The data were analyzed from April 2016 to June 2016 and in July 2017. The primary end points were safety and objective response rate. Immune analyses were performed on blood and tumor tissue. A total of 42 women (median age, 49 years; range, 23-78 years) were enrolled (29 [69%] squamous cell cervical cancer and 13 [31%] adenocarcinoma; 37 [93%] of 40 patients with tissue available for analysis had HPV-positive confirmation; there was no archival tissue for 2 women). Grade 3 toxic effects included diarrhea in 4 patients, 3 of whom had colitis. Of 34 patients evaluated for best response (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1), 1 patient had partial response and 10 had stable disease. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 2.5 months (95% CI, 2.1-3.2 months) and 8.5 months (95% CI, 3.6-not reached; 1 patient was still alive), respectively. Intratumoral pretreatment CD3, CD4, CD8, FoxP3, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression was not predictive of benefit and did not significantly change with treatment. Multicolor flow cytometry on peripheral lymphocytes revealed a treatment-dependent increase of inducible T-cell costimulator, human leukocyte antigen-antigen D related, and PD-1 during initial treatment, which returned to baseline during maintenance. Ipilimumab was tolerable in this population but did not show significant single-agent activity. Immune changes were induced by anti-CTLA-4 therapy but did not correlate with clinical activity. Changes in these markers may guide further treatment strategies.",Journal Article,558.0,21.0,"Based on evidence of human papillomavirus HPV -induced immune evasion immunotherapy may be an attractive strategy in cancer Ipilimumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 CTLA-4 which acts to downregulate the T-cell immune response To assess the safety and antitumor activity of ipilimumab in recurrent cancer A multicenter trial was designed for patients with metastatic cancer squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma with measurable disease and progression after at least 1 line of platinum chemotherapy A run-in safety cohort using ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 21 days for 4 cycles in 6 patients was followed by a phase II cohort of ipilimumab 10 mg/kg every 21 days for 4 cycles and then 4 cycles of maintenance therapy every 12 weeks for patients demonstrating radiologic response or stabilization Immune correlative studies were performed on peripheral blood before and after therapy on archival tissue and fresh tumor obtained prior to registration and 7 days after cycle 2 The study was conducted from December 3 2012 to September 15 2014 The data were analyzed from April 2016 to June 2016 and in July 2017 The primary end points were safety and objective response rate Immune analyses were performed on blood and tumor tissue A total of 42 women median age 49 years range 23-78 years were enrolled 29 69 squamous cell cancer and 13 31 adenocarcinoma 37 93 of 40 patients with tissue available for analysis had HPV-positive confirmation there was no archival tissue for 2 women Grade 3 toxic effects included diarrhea in 4 patients 3 of whom had colitis Of 34 patients evaluated for best response Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 1 patient had partial response and 10 had stable disease The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 2.5 months 95 CI 2.1-3.2 months and 8.5 months 95 CI 3.6-not reached 1 patient was still alive respectively Intratumoral pretreatment CD3 CD4 CD8 FoxP3 indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1 expression was not predictive of benefit and did not significantly change with treatment Multicolor flow cytometry on peripheral lymphocytes revealed a treatment-dependent increase of inducible T-cell costimulator human leukocyte antigen-antigen D related and PD-1 during initial treatment which returned to baseline during maintenance Ipilimumab was tolerable in this population but did not show significant single-agent activity Immune changes were induced by anti-CTLA-4 therapy but did not correlate with clinical activity Changes in these markers may guide further treatment strategies",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[90, 23, 241, 1, 171, 3242, 933, 277, 250, 5351, 726, 68, 40, 35, 3059, 692, 4, 12, 1306, 16, 8, 1910, 3619, 848, 548, 17, 2860, 759, 102, 1448, 448, 39, 2127, 39, 92, 4459, 6, 10261, 3, 102, 31, 250, 51, 6, 423, 3, 367, 2, 579, 128, 1, 1306, 4, 387, 12, 8, 1570, 160, 10, 1114, 9, 7, 5, 113, 12, 691, 31, 134, 15, 449, 5, 1884, 34, 2, 91, 50, 28, 506, 14, 328, 1, 828, 56, 8, 7726, 4, 367, 180, 75, 1306, 27, 81, 503, 454, 239, 162, 9, 39, 410, 4, 49, 7, 10, 370, 20, 8, 124, 215, 180, 1, 1306, 79, 81, 503, 454, 239, 162, 9, 39, 410, 2, 818, 39, 410, 1, 1146, 36, 454, 133, 244, 9, 7, 2219, 2812, 51, 15, 3184, 250, 3679, 94, 11, 173, 23, 672, 315, 348, 2, 50, 36, 23, 3967, 246, 2, 4329, 30, 683, 324, 6, 3169, 2, 67, 162, 50, 417, 18, 3, 45, 10, 426, 29, 1397, 27, 1195, 6, 2636, 167, 1409, 3, 74, 11, 311, 29, 2292, 1390, 6, 1924, 1390, 2, 4, 2066, 1759, 3, 86, 396, 862, 11, 367, 2, 461, 51, 116, 250, 318, 11, 173, 23, 315, 2, 30, 246, 8, 181, 1, 595, 117, 52, 89, 739, 60, 184, 382, 833, 60, 11, 346, 462, 790, 691, 31, 12, 2, 233, 456, 449, 567, 966, 1, 327, 7, 5, 246, 390, 9, 65, 42, 933, 109, 3551, 125, 10, 77, 3967, 246, 9, 18, 117, 88, 27, 1812, 176, 159, 1172, 4, 39, 7, 27, 1, 953, 42, 4132, 1, 562, 7, 194, 9, 824, 51, 51, 451, 371, 4, 537, 57, 2256, 14, 14, 14, 69, 42, 450, 51, 2, 79, 42, 585, 34, 3, 52, 91, 115, 25, 2, 63, 25, 11, 18, 33, 53, 48, 58, 18, 14, 27, 18, 53, 2, 66, 33, 53, 48, 58, 27, 49, 44, 1300, 14, 69, 10, 1234, 1701, 106, 2074, 1194, 3117, 1440, 968, 3548, 10566, 18, 27, 9175, 2, 1846, 31, 273, 1232, 14, 333, 729, 55, 10, 44, 464, 1, 247, 2, 205, 44, 97, 707, 5, 24, 11920, 1412, 1914, 23, 672, 1594, 553, 8, 24, 470, 344, 1, 2877, 102, 31, 23705, 171, 3627, 448, 448, 427, 139, 2, 333, 14, 190, 388, 24, 92, 5157, 6, 330, 190, 1146, 1306, 10, 2668, 4, 26, 266, 84, 205, 44, 514, 93, 226, 420, 128, 250, 400, 11, 277, 20, 312, 2127, 39, 36, 84, 205, 44, 1513, 5, 38, 128, 400, 4, 46, 525, 68, 1597, 195, 24, 422]",2642.0,29145543,413
Development of a goat model for evaluation of withaferin A: Cervical implants for the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,Experimental and molecular pathology,Exp. Mol. Pathol.,2017-11-21,"Cervical cancer is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). The disease develops over many years through a series of precancerous lesions. Cervical cancer can be prevented by HPV-vaccination, screening and treatment of precancer before development of cervical cancer. The treatment of high-grade cervical dysplasia (CIN <sup>2+</sup>) has traditionally been by cervical conization. Surgical procedures are associated with increased risk of undesirable side effects including bleeding, infection, scarring (stenosis), infertility and complications in later pregnancies. An inexpensive, non-invasive method of delivering therapeutics locally will be favorable to treat precancerous cervical lesions without damaging healthy tissue. The feasibility and safety of a sustained, continuous drug-releasing cervical polymeric implant for use in clinical trials was studied using a large animal model. The goat (Capra hircus), non-pregnant adult female Boer goats, was chosen due to similarities in cervical dimensions to the human. Estrus was induced with progesterone CIDR® vaginal implants for 14days followed by the administration of chorionic gonadotropins 48h prior to removal of the progesterone implants to relax the cervix to allow for the placement of the cervical implant. Cervical implants, containing 2% and 4% withaferin A (WFA), with 8 coats of blank polymer, provided sustained release for a long duration and were used for the animal study. The 'mushroom'-shaped cervical polymeric implant, originally designed for women required redesigning to be accommodated within the goat cervix. The cervical implants were well tolerated by the animals with no obvious evidence of discomfort, systemic or local inflammation or toxicity. In addition, we developed a new method to analyze tissue WFA levels by solvent extractions and LS/MS-MS. WFA was found to be localized to the target and adjacent tissues with 12-16ng WFA/g tissue, with essentially no detectable WFA in distant tissues. This study suggests that the goat is a good large animal model for the future development and evaluation of therapeutic efficacy of continuous local drug delivery by cervical polymeric implants to treat precancerous cervical lesions.",Journal Article,791.0,1.0,cancer is caused by human papillomavirus HPV The disease develops over many years through a series of precancerous lesions cancer can be prevented by HPV-vaccination screening and treatment of precancer before development of cancer The treatment of high-grade dysplasia CIN sup 2+ /sup has traditionally been by conization Surgical procedures are associated with increased risk of undesirable side effects including bleeding infection scarring stenosis infertility and complications in later pregnancies An inexpensive non-invasive method of delivering therapeutics locally will be favorable to treat precancerous lesions without damaging healthy tissue The feasibility and safety of a sustained continuous drug-releasing polymeric implant for use in clinical trials was studied using a large animal model The goat Capra hircus non-pregnant adult female Boer goats was chosen due to similarities in dimensions to the human Estrus was induced with progesterone CIDR® implants for 14days followed by the administration of chorionic gonadotropins 48h prior to removal of the progesterone implants to relax the cervix to allow for the placement of the implant implants containing 2 and 4 withaferin A WFA with 8 coats of blank polymer provided sustained release for a long duration and were used for the animal study The 'mushroom'-shaped polymeric implant originally designed for women required redesigning to be accommodated within the goat cervix The implants were well tolerated by the animals with no obvious evidence of discomfort systemic or local inflammation or toxicity In addition we developed a new method to analyze tissue WFA levels by solvent extractions and LS/MS-MS.

Use of Larynx-Preservation Strategies in the Treatment of Laryngeal Cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guideline Update.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2017-11-27,"Purpose To update the guideline recommendations on the use of larynx-preservation strategies in the treatment of laryngeal cancer. Methods An Expert Panel updated the systematic review of the literature for the period from January 2005 to May 2017. Results The panel confirmed that the use of a larynx-preservation approach for appropriately selected patients does not compromise survival. No larynx-preservation approach offered a survival advantage compared with total laryngectomy and adjuvant therapy as indicated. Changes were supported for the use of endoscopic surgical resection in patients with limited disease (T1, T2) and for initial total laryngectomy in patients with T4a disease or with severe pretreatment laryngeal dysfunction. New recommendations for positron emission tomography imaging for the evaluation of regional nodes after treatment and best measures for evaluating voice and swallowing function were added. Recommendations Patients with T1, T2 laryngeal cancer should be treated initially with intent to preserve the larynx by using endoscopic resection or radiation therapy, with either leading to similar outcomes. For patients with locally advanced (T3, T4) disease, organ-preservation surgery, combined chemotherapy and radiation, or radiation alone offer the potential for larynx preservation without compromising overall survival. For selected patients with extensive T3 or large T4a lesions and/or poor pretreatment laryngeal function, better survival rates and quality of life may be achieved with total laryngectomy.

Impact of tumour histology on survival in advanced cervical carcinoma: an NRG Oncology/Gynaecologic Oncology Group Study.,British journal of cancer,Br. J. Cancer,2017-11-28,"Based primarily on studies concerning early-stage tumours (treated surgically), and locally advanced disease (treated with chemoradiation), the prognosis for women with adenocarcinoma (AC) or adenosquamous (AS) carcinoma has been reported to be poorer than those with squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) of the cervix. It is unclear whether differences in prognosis also persist in the setting of recurrent or metastatic disease treated using chemotherapy doublets with or without bevacizumab. Cases were pooled from three Gynaecologic Oncology Group randomised phase III trials of chemotherapy doublets. Pearson's test was used to evaluate response rate (RR) of AC/AS vs SCCA, Kaplan-Meier method to estimate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the impact of histology on PFS and OS. Of 781 evaluable patients, 77% (N=599) had SCCA and 23% (N=182) AC/AS. There were no significant differences in RRs between histologic subgroups. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for death for SCCA vs AC/AS was 1.13 (95% CI 0.93, 1.38 P=0.23). When comparing SC/AS (N=661, 85%) to AC alone (N=120, 15%), the adjusted HR for death was 1.23 (95% CI 0.97, 1.57, P=0.09).

The feasibility of detecting endometrial and ovarian cancer using DNA methylation biomarkers in cervical scrapings.,Journal of gynecologic oncology,J Gynecol Oncol,2018-01-01,"We hypothesized that DNA methylation of development-related genes may occur in endometrial cancer (EC)/ovarian cancer (OC) and may be detected in cervical scrapings. We tested methylation status by quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction for 14 genes in DNA pools of endometrial and OC tissues. Tissues of EC/normal endometrium, OC/normal ovary, were verified in training set using cervical scrapings of 10 EC/10 OC patients and 10 controls, and further validated in the testing set using independent cervical scrapings in 30 EC/30 OC patients and 30 controls. We generated cutoff values of methylation index (M-index) from cervical scrapings to distinguish between cancer patients and control. Sensitivity/specificity of DNA methylation biomarkers in detecting EC and OC was calculated. Of 14 genes, 4 (PTGDR, HS3ST2, POU4F3, MAGI2) showed hypermethylation in EC and OC tissues, and were verified in training set. POU4F3 and MAGI2 exhibited hypermethylation in training set were validated in independent cases. The mean M-index of POU4F3 is 78.28 in EC and 20.36 in OC, which are higher than that in controls (6.59; p<0.001 and p=0.100, respectively), and that of MAGI2 is 246.0 in EC and 12.2 in OC, which is significantly higher that than in controls (2.85; p<0.001 and p=0.480, respectively).

Tuberculosis in Pap samples with emphasis on LBC: Caught only when thought.,Diagnostic cytopathology,Diagn. Cytopathol.,2017-11-28,"Despite being a commonly encountered infection, the clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis of the uterine cervix is elusive. Though a straightforward diagnosis on tissue sections, identification of typical features of tubercular infection on cervical Pap samples is challenging. In our experience, the infrequent pale staining collections of epithelioid cells are difficult to pick up on Pap stained smears, particularly LBC samples.

Impact of HPV 16/18 infection on clinical outcomes in locally advanced cervical cancers treated with radical radio (chemo) therapy - A prospective observational study.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2017-12-06,"With an aim to investigate the impact of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) 16/18 infection on clinical outcomes in locally advanced cervical cancers treated with radical radio (chemo) therapy, we undertook this prospective study. Between May 2010 and April 2012, 150 histologically proven cervical cancer patients treated with radio (chemo) therapy were accrued. Cervical biopsies/brushings were collected at pre-treatment, end of treatment and at 3 monthly intervals up to 24months. Quantitative estimation of HPV 16/18 was done using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and correlated with various clinical end-points. Out of 150 patients accrued, 135 patients were considered for final analysis. Pre-treatment HPV16/18 DNA was detected in 126 (93%) patients, with HPV-16 present in 91%. The mean log (±SD) HPV-16 and HPV-18 viral load at pre-treatment was 4.76 (±2.5) and 0.14 (±2.1) copies/10ng of DNA, respectively. Though significant decline in viral load was observed on follow-ups (p<0.0001); by 9-month follow-up, 89 (66%) patients had persistence of HPV infection. Patients with persistent HPV 16/18 infection had a significantly higher overall and loco-regional relapses [44/89 (49%) and 29/89 (32%)] as compared to HPV clearance by 9months [12/43 (28%) and 5/43 (11%)] with p=0.024 and p=0.02, respectively. Also, persistent HPV infection by 24-month showed a significant impact on loco-regional control (LRC) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). In locally advanced cervical cancers treated with radical radio (chemo) therapy, persistent HPV 16/18 infection is significantly high in immediate post-treatment period and correlated with higher loco-regional, overall relapses and was also associated with early relapses.",Journal Article,776.0,4.0,With an aim to investigate the impact of Human Papilloma Virus HPV 16/18 infection on clinical outcomes in locally advanced cancers treated with radical radio chemo therapy we undertook this prospective study Between May 2010 and April 2012 150 histologically proven cancer patients treated with radio chemo therapy were accrued biopsies/brushings were collected at pre-treatment end of treatment and at 3 monthly intervals up to 24months Quantitative estimation of HPV 16/18 was done using real-time polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR and correlated with various clinical end-points Out of 150 patients accrued 135 patients were considered for final analysis Pre-treatment HPV16/18 DNA was detected in 126 93 patients with HPV-16 present in 91 The mean log ±SD HPV-16 and HPV-18 viral load at pre-treatment was 4.76 ±2.5 and 0.14 ±2.1 copies/10ng of DNA respectively Though significant decline in viral load was observed on follow-ups p 0.0001 by 9-month follow-up 89 66 patients had persistence of HPV infection Patients with persistent HPV 16/18 infection had a significantly higher overall and loco-regional relapses 44/89 49 and 29/89 32 as compared to HPV clearance by 9months 12/43 28 and 5/43 11 with p=0.024 and p=0.02 respectively Also persistent HPV infection by 24-month showed a significant impact on loco-regional control LRC and recurrence-free survival RFS In locally advanced cancers treated with radical radio chemo therapy persistent HPV 16/18 infection is significantly high in immediate post-treatment period and correlated with higher loco-regional overall relapses and was also associated with early relapses,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[5, 35, 1130, 6, 963, 3, 345, 1, 171, 7017, 1450, 933, 245, 203, 930, 23, 38, 123, 4, 795, 131, 163, 73, 5, 711, 6477, 3341, 36, 21, 5418, 26, 482, 45, 59, 68, 1120, 2, 2292, 1195, 1577, 2161, 1930, 12, 7, 73, 5, 6477, 3341, 36, 11, 3198, 1154, 14515, 11, 786, 28, 671, 24, 396, 1, 24, 2, 28, 27, 3889, 1582, 126, 6, 41924, 1156, 4470, 1, 933, 245, 203, 10, 1822, 75, 1589, 98, 1451, 1260, 1329, 240, 604, 2, 438, 5, 747, 38, 396, 862, 1205, 1, 1577, 7, 3198, 3978, 7, 11, 515, 9, 1457, 65, 671, 24, 4048, 203, 261, 10, 530, 4, 3927, 966, 7, 5, 933, 245, 364, 4, 970, 3, 313, 1066, 22658, 933, 245, 2, 933, 203, 1667, 3800, 28, 671, 24, 10, 39, 846, 22627, 33, 2, 13, 213, 22627, 14, 5127, 35377, 1, 261, 106, 2471, 93, 1858, 4, 1667, 3800, 10, 164, 23, 166, 6106, 19, 13, 488, 20, 83, 811, 166, 126, 887, 700, 7, 42, 4108, 1, 933, 930, 7, 5, 1882, 933, 245, 203, 930, 42, 8, 97, 142, 63, 2, 7214, 951, 3713, 584, 887, 739, 2, 462, 887, 531, 22, 72, 6, 933, 1960, 20, 16988, 133, 601, 339, 2, 33, 601, 175, 5, 19, 13, 4247, 2, 19, 13, 588, 106, 120, 1882, 933, 930, 20, 259, 811, 224, 8, 93, 345, 23, 7214, 951, 182, 4000, 2, 146, 115, 25, 1272, 4, 795, 131, 163, 73, 5, 711, 6477, 3341, 36, 1882, 933, 245, 203, 930, 16, 97, 64, 4, 2181, 539, 24, 727, 2, 438, 5, 142, 7214, 951, 63, 3713, 2, 10, 120, 41, 5, 191, 3713]",1629.0,29203175,71
Familial Cancer Clustering in Urothelial Cancer: A Population-Based Case-Control Study.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2018-05-01,"Family history of bladder cancer confers an increased risk for concordant and discordant cancers in relatives. However, previous studies investigating this relationship lack any correction for smoking status of family members. We conducted a population-based study of cancer risks in relatives of bladder cancer patients and matched controls with exclusion of variant subtypes to improve the understanding of familial cancer clustering. Case subjects with urothelial carcinoma were identified using the Utah Cancer Registry and matched 1:5 to cancer-free controls from the Utah Population Database. Cox regression was used to determine the risk of cancer in first-degree relatives, second-degree relatives, first cousins, and spouses. A total of 229 251 relatives of case subjects and 1 197 552 relatives of matched control subjects were analyzed. To correct for smoking status, we performed a secondary analysis excluding families with elevated rates of smoking-related cancers. All statistical tests were two-sided. First- and second-degree relatives of case subjects had an increased risk for any cancer diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03 to 1.09, P < .001; HR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.07, P = .001) and urothelial cancer (HR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.50 to 1.99, P < .001; HR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.21 to 1.51, P < .001). Site-specific analysis found increased risk for bladder (HR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.47 to 1.95, P < .001), kidney (HR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.08 to 1.57, P = .006), cervical (HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.49, P = .01), and lung cancer (HR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.19 to 1.51, P < .001) in first-degree relatives. Second-degree relatives had increased risk for bladder (HR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.2 to 1.5, P < .001) and thyroid cancer (HR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.35, P = .02). Spouses showed an increased risk for laryngeal (HR = 2.68, 95% CI = 1.02 to 7.05, P = .04) and cervical cancer (HR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.13 to 2.17, P = .007). These results did not substantively change after correction for suspected smoking behaviors. Our results suggest familial urothelial cancer clustering independent of smoking, with increased risk in relatives for both concordant and discordant cancers, suggesting shared genetic or environmental roots.

"Upregulation of the BDNF/TrKB pathway promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition, as well as the migration and invasion of cervical cancer.",International journal of oncology,Int. J. Oncol.,2017-12-19,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has previously been demonstrated to be associated with several types of cancer. In addition, its receptor, tropomyosin related kinase B (TrkB) is involved in tumor invasion and metastasis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated with metastasis in cancers. Thus, The aim of the present study was to examine whether BDNF/TrKB expression is linked to a poor survival and the acquisition of the EMT phenotype in cervical cancer. We found that a high positive expression of BDNF/TrKB was associated with poor survival in cervical cancer. Our results revealed that high expression levels of BDNF/TrKB were observed in cervical cancer compared to normal cells. Importantly, we demonstrated that the silencing of TrKB suppressed the activation of EMT via the downregulation of N-cadherin, vimentin, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 and MMP9, and the upregulation of E-cadherin and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)2, which resulted in suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Furthermore, high phosphorylation levels of ERK and Akt were observed in the cervical cancer cells, while these levels were decreased in the cells in which TrKB was knocked down.

Lymph node ratio as a prognostic factor in metastatic cutaneous head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,Head & neck,Head Neck,2018-01-23,The prognostic impact of the size and number of nodal metastases in head and neck cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is well established. The purpose of this study was to validate the prognostic significance of the lymph node ratio in metastatic head and neck cutaneous SCC. A retrospective review of 326 patients with head and neck cutaneous SCC with parotid and/or cervical nodal metastases was performed. The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). The minimal-P approach was used to investigate the optimal lymph node ratio threshold. Our data included 77 recurrences and 101 deaths. A lymph node ratio of 6% was a significant predictor of shorter DFS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-2.38; P = .01) and OS (HR 1.63; 95% CI 1.03-2.58; P = 0.04) on multivariable analysis.

Results One hundred thirty-four patients received treatment. Alpelisib maximum tolerated doses were established as 400 mg once daily and 150 mg twice daily. Nine patients (13.2%) in the dose-escalation phase had dose-limiting toxicities of hyperglycemia (n = 6), nausea (n = 2), and both hyperglycemia and hypophosphatemia (n = 1). Frequent all-grade, treatment-related adverse events included hyperglycemia (51.5%), nausea (50.0%), decreased appetite (41.8%), diarrhea (40.3%), and vomiting (31.3%). Alpelisib was rapidly absorbed; half-life was 7.6 hours at 400 mg once daily with minimal accumulation. Objective tumor responses were observed at doses ≥ 270 mg once daily; overall response rate was 6.0% (n = 8; one patient with endometrial cancer had a complete response, and seven patients with cervical, breast, endometrial, colon, and rectal cancers had partial responses). Stable disease was achieved in 70 (52.2%) patients and was maintained > 24 weeks in 13 (9.7%) patients; disease control rate (complete and partial responses and stable disease) was 58.2%. In patients with estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer, median progression-free survival was 5.5 months. Frequently mutated genes (≥ 10% tumors) included TP53 (51.3%), APC (23.7%), KRAS (22.4%), ARID1A (13.2%), and FBXW7 (10.5%). Conclusion Alpelisib demonstrated a tolerable safety profile and encouraging preliminary activity in patients with PIK3CA-altered solid tumors, supporting the rationale for selective PI3Kα inhibition in combination with other agents for the treatment of PIK3CA-mutant tumors.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",715.0,65.0,Purpose We report the first-in-human phase Ia study to our knowledge ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01219699 identifying the maximum tolerated dose and assessing safety and preliminary efficacy of single-agent alpelisib BYL719 an oral phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase PI3Kα -selective inhibitor Patients and Methods In the dose-escalation phase patients with PIK3CA-altered advanced solid tumors received once-daily or twice-daily oral alpelisib on a continuous schedule In the dose-expansion phase patients with PIK3CA-altered solid tumors and PIK3CA-wild-type estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative cancer received alpelisib 400 mg once daily Results One hundred thirty-four patients received treatment Alpelisib maximum tolerated doses were established as 400 mg once daily and 150 mg twice daily Nine patients 13.2 in the dose-escalation phase had dose-limiting toxicities of hyperglycemia n 6 nausea n 2 and both hyperglycemia and hypophosphatemia n 1 Frequent all-grade treatment-related adverse events included hyperglycemia 51.5 nausea 50.0 decreased appetite 41.8 diarrhea 40.3 and vomiting 31.3 Alpelisib was rapidly absorbed half-life was 7.6 hours at 400 mg once daily with minimal accumulation Objective tumor responses were observed at doses ≥ 270 mg once daily overall response rate was 6.0 n 8 one patient with cancer had a complete response and seven patients with and cancers had partial responses Stable disease was achieved in 70 52.2 patients and was maintained 24 weeks in 13 9.7 patients disease control rate complete and partial responses and stable disease was 58.2 In patients with estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative cancer median progression-free survival was 5.5 months Frequently mutated genes ≥ 10 tumors included TP53 51.3 APC 23.7 KRAS 22.4 ARID1A 13.2 and FBXW7 10.5 Conclusion Alpelisib demonstrated a tolerable safety profile and encouraging preliminary activity in patients with PIK3CA-altered solid tumors supporting the rationale for selective PI3Kα inhibition in combination with other agents for the treatment of PIK3CA-mutant tumors,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,"[743, 21, 414, 3, 157, 4, 171, 124, 3302, 45, 6, 114, 922, 1252, 1239, 3719, 72101, 1386, 3, 689, 421, 61, 2, 1977, 367, 2, 1676, 209, 1, 226, 420, 21850, 19337, 35, 518, 3415, 27, 216, 17552, 1094, 230, 7, 2, 636, 4, 3, 61, 1125, 124, 7, 5, 1506, 1495, 131, 537, 57, 103, 1059, 391, 15, 936, 391, 518, 21850, 23, 8, 1314, 1055, 4, 3, 61, 1422, 124, 7, 5, 1506, 1495, 537, 57, 2, 1506, 955, 267, 808, 153, 109, 171, 829, 129, 161, 153, 18, 199, 12, 103, 21850, 1524, 81, 1059, 391, 99, 104, 1128, 977, 294, 7, 103, 24, 21850, 689, 421, 415, 11, 635, 22, 1524, 81, 1059, 391, 2, 1577, 81, 936, 391, 762, 7, 233, 18, 4, 3, 61, 1125, 124, 42, 61, 817, 385, 1, 3992, 78, 49, 1218, 78, 18, 2, 110, 3992, 2, 8021, 78, 14, 908, 62, 88, 24, 139, 290, 281, 159, 3992, 725, 33, 1218, 212, 13, 340, 4062, 605, 66, 1172, 327, 27, 2, 1966, 456, 27, 21850, 10, 1755, 5249, 1303, 358, 10, 67, 49, 1459, 28, 1524, 81, 1059, 391, 5, 1048, 1835, 461, 30, 253, 11, 164, 28, 415, 749, 6666, 81, 1059, 391, 63, 51, 116, 10, 49, 13, 78, 66, 104, 69, 5, 12, 42, 8, 236, 51, 2, 648, 7, 5, 2, 163, 42, 450, 253, 585, 34, 10, 513, 4, 431, 653, 18, 7, 2, 10, 1955, 259, 244, 4, 233, 83, 67, 7, 34, 182, 116, 236, 2, 450, 253, 2, 585, 34, 10, 717, 18, 4, 7, 5, 808, 153, 109, 171, 829, 129, 161, 153, 18, 199, 12, 52, 91, 115, 25, 10, 33, 33, 53, 746, 1185, 214, 749, 79, 57, 159, 1206, 725, 27, 2528, 382, 67, 723, 350, 39, 5430, 233, 18, 2, 8352, 79, 33, 1221, 21850, 264, 8, 2668, 367, 800, 2, 2269, 1676, 128, 4, 7, 5, 1506, 1495, 537, 57, 1912, 3, 1728, 9, 1094, 17552, 297, 4, 150, 5, 127, 183, 9, 3, 24, 1, 1506, 620, 57]",2152.0,29401002,142

Clin. Oncol.,2018-02-12,"Purpose We compared the efficacy and toxicity of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical surgery versus standard cisplatin-based chemoradiation in patients with locally advanced squamous cervical cancer. Patients and Methods This was a single-center, phase III, randomized controlled trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00193739). Eligible patients were between 18 and 65 years old and had stage IB2, IIA, or IIB squamous cervical cancer. They were randomly assigned, after stratification by stage, to receive either three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy using paclitaxel and carboplatin once every 3 weeks followed by radical hysterectomy or standard radiotherapy with concomitant cisplatin once every week for 5 weeks. Patients in the neoadjuvant group received postoperative adjuvant radiation or concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, if indicated. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS), defined as survival without relapse or death related to cancer, and secondary end points included overall survival and toxicity. Results Between September 2003 and February 2015, 635 patients were randomly assigned, of whom 633 (316 patients in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus surgery group and 317 patients in the concomitant chemoradiation group) were included in the final analysis, with a median follow-up time of 58.5 months. The 5-year DFS in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus surgery group was 69.3% compared with 76.7% in the concomitant chemoradiation group (hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.87; P = .038), whereas the corresponding 5-year OS rates were 75.4% and 74.7%, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.025; 95% CI, 0.752 to 1.398; P = .87). The delayed toxicities at 24 months or later after treatment completion in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus surgery group versus the concomitant chemoradiation group were rectal (2.2% v 3.5%, respectively), bladder (1.6% v 3.5%, respectively), and vaginal (12.0% v 25.6%, respectively).

Insurance status and cancer treatment mediate the association between race/ethnicity and cervical cancer survival.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2018-02-15,"Cervical cancer outcomes remain poor among disadvantaged populations, including ethnic minorities, low-income, and underinsured women. The aim of this study was to evaluate the mechanisms that underlie the observed association between race/ethnicity and cervical cancer survival. We identified 13,698 women, ages 21 to 64 years, diagnosed with stages I-III primary cervical cancer between 2007-2013 in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models evaluated associations between race/ethnicity (Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Other) and cervical cancer-specific mortality. We conducted mediation analysis to calculate the mediation proportion and its 95% confidence interval. Non-Hispanic black women had an increased risk of cervical cancer-specific mortality (HR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.08-1.39), and Hispanic women a decreased risk of dying from their disease (HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.72-0.93), compared with non-Hispanic white. The estimated proportion of excess cervical cancer mortality for non-Hispanic black women relative to non-Hispanic white women that was mediated by insurance was 18.6% and by treatment was 47.2%.

In this population-based study we found that some of the excess cervical cancer-specific mortality for non-Hispanic black women is mediated by factors such as insurance status and treatment.

Clinicopathologic characteristics of poorly differentiated chordoma.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2018-02-26,"Chordoma is a rare malignant tumor of bone with high morbidity and mortality. Recently, aggressive pediatric poorly differentiated chordoma with SMARCB1 loss has been described. This study summarizes the clinicopathologic features of poorly differentiated chordoma with SMARCB1 loss in the largest series to date. A search of records between 1990-2017 at MGH identified 19 patients with poorly differentiated chordoma. Immunohistochemical stains were evaluated. Kaplan-Meier survival statistics and log-rank (Mantel Cox) tests compared survival with other subtypes. The patients (n = 19) were diagnosed at a median age of 11 years (range: 1-29). Tumors arose in the skull base and clivus (n = 10/19; 53%); cervical spine (n = 6/19; 32%); and sacrum or coccyx (n = 3/19; 16%). The clinical stage of these patients (AJCC 7e) was stage 2A (n = 7/16; 44%); stage 2B (n = 6/16; 38%); stage 4A (n = 1/16; 6%); and stage 4B (n = 2/16; 13%). The tumors were composed of sheets of epithelioid cells with nuclear pleomorphism, abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, and increased mitoses. Tumors were positive for cytokeratin (n = 18/18; 100%) and brachyury (n = 18/18; 100%). Patients were treated with a combination of excision, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. No difference in overall survival, progression free survival, local control time, and metastasis free survival was identified between poorly differentiated chordoma of the skull base and of the spine. Compared to other chordoma subtypes, poorly differentiated chordoma has a significantly decreased mean overall survival after stratification by site (p = 0.037). Pediatric poorly differentiated chordoma has a distinct clinical and immunohistochemical profile, with characteristic SMARCB1 loss and decreased survival compared to conventional/chondroid chordoma. Recognition of this subtype is important because these malignancies should be treated aggressively with multimodality therapy.",Journal Article,694.0,10.0,Chordoma is a rare malignant tumor of with high morbidity and mortality Recently aggressive pediatric poorly differentiated chordoma with SMARCB1 loss has been described This study summarizes the clinicopathologic features of poorly differentiated chordoma with SMARCB1 loss in the largest series to date A search of records between 1990-2017 at MGH identified 19 patients with poorly differentiated chordoma Immunohistochemical stains were evaluated Kaplan-Meier survival statistics and log-rank Mantel Cox tests compared survival with other subtypes The patients n 19 were diagnosed at a median age of 11 years range 1-29 Tumors arose in the skull base and clivus n 10/19 53 spine n 6/19 32 and sacrum or coccyx n 3/19 16 The clinical stage of these patients AJCC 7e was stage 2A n 7/16 44 stage 2B n 6/16 38 stage 4A n 1/16 6 and stage 4B n 2/16 13 The tumors were composed of sheets of epithelioid cells with nuclear pleomorphism abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and increased mitoses Tumors were positive for cytokeratin n 18/18 100 and brachyury n 18/18 100 Patients were treated with a combination of excision radiation therapy and chemotherapy No difference in overall survival progression free survival local control time and metastasis free survival was identified between poorly differentiated chordoma of the skull base and of the spine Compared to other chordoma subtypes poorly differentiated chordoma has a significantly decreased mean overall survival after stratification by site p 0.037 Pediatric poorly differentiated chordoma has a distinct clinical and immunohistochemical profile with characteristic SMARCB1 loss and decreased survival compared to conventional/chondroid chordoma Recognition of this subtype is important because these malignancies should be treated aggressively with multimodality therapy,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[3911, 16, 8, 622, 393, 30, 1, 5, 64, 787, 2, 282, 761, 571, 815, 1240, 1442, 3911, 5, 5952, 407, 71, 85, 1027, 26, 45, 2869, 3, 1399, 404, 1, 1240, 1442, 3911, 5, 5952, 407, 4, 3, 2166, 988, 6, 1244, 8, 1901, 1, 1064, 59, 2289, 1759, 28, 10704, 108, 326, 7, 5, 1240, 1442, 3911, 1382, 7742, 11, 194, 876, 882, 25, 3065, 2, 1066, 1026, 11618, 418, 895, 72, 25, 5, 127, 814, 3, 7, 78, 326, 11, 265, 28, 8, 52, 89, 1, 175, 60, 184, 14, 462, 57, 7268, 4, 3, 5054, 1782, 2, 29835, 78, 79, 326, 699, 2342, 78, 49, 326, 531, 2, 11629, 15, 43903, 78, 27, 326, 245, 3, 38, 82, 1, 46, 7, 2271, 22893, 10, 82, 4707, 78, 67, 245, 584, 82, 3381, 78, 49, 245, 519, 82, 14820, 78, 14, 245, 49, 2, 82, 16030, 78, 18, 245, 233, 3, 57, 11, 3317, 1, 13568, 1, 3838, 37, 5, 928, 14152, 4834, 9757, 4558, 2, 101, 7246, 57, 11, 109, 9, 4292, 78, 203, 203, 394, 2, 19979, 78, 203, 203, 394, 7, 11, 73, 5, 8, 150, 1, 1366, 121, 36, 2, 56, 77, 523, 4, 63, 25, 91, 115, 25, 293, 182, 98, 2, 278, 115, 25, 10, 108, 59, 1240, 1442, 3911, 1, 3, 5054, 1782, 2, 1, 3, 2342, 72, 6, 127, 3911, 814, 1240, 1442, 3911, 71, 8, 97, 340, 313, 63, 25, 50, 1541, 20, 606, 19, 13, 5171, 815, 1240, 1442, 3911, 71, 8, 834, 38, 2, 1382, 800, 5, 2037, 5952, 407, 2, 340, 25, 72, 6, 809, 15590, 3911, 2335, 1, 26, 875, 16, 305, 408, 46, 441, 257, 40, 73, 8503, 5, 2425, 36]",1826.0,29483606,387
A Randomized Phase 2 Study of ADXS11-001 Listeria monocytogenes-Listeriolysin O Immunotherapy With or Without Cisplatin in Treatment of Advanced Cervical Cancer.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2018-05-01,"A global unmet medical need exists for effective treatments for persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer, as patients have a short life expectancy. Recently, immunotherapies have shown promising survival benefits for patients with advanced forms of cancer. Axalimogene filolisbac (ADXS11-001), a Listeria monocytogenes immunotherapy with a broad effect on the immune system, is under investigation for treatment of human papillomavirus-associated cancers including cervical cancer. This phase 2 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of ADXS11-001, administered with or without cisplatin, in patients with recurrent/refractory cervical cancer following prior chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. A total of 109 patients were treated, and 69 were evaluable for tumor response at equal to or more than 3 months postbaseline. Median overall survival (OS) was comparable between treatment groups (ADXS11-001: 8.28 months; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.85-10.5 months; ADXS11-001 + cisplatin: 8.78 months; 95% CI, 7.4-13.3 months). The 12- and 18-month milestone OS rates were 30.9% versus 38.9%, and 23.6% versus 25.9% for each group, respectively (34.9% and 24.8% combined). Median progression-free survival (6.10 vs 6.08 months) and the overall response rate (17.1% vs 14.7%) were similar for both groups. ADXS11-001 was generally well tolerated; adverse events were predominantly mild to moderate in severity and not related to treatment. More adverse events were reported in the combination group (429 vs 275). These promising safety and efficacy results, including the encouraging 12-month 34.9% combined OS rate, warrant further investigation of ADXS11-001 for treatment of recurrent/refractory cervical cancer.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",630.0,14.0,A global unmet medical need exists for effective treatments for persistent recurrent or metastatic cancer as patients have a short life expectancy Recently immunotherapies have shown promising survival benefits for patients with advanced forms of cancer Axalimogene filolisbac ADXS11-001 a Listeria monocytogenes immunotherapy with a broad effect on the immune system is under investigation for treatment of human papillomavirus-associated cancers including cancer This phase 2 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of ADXS11-001 administered with or without cisplatin in patients with recurrent/refractory cancer following prior chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy A total of 109 patients were treated and 69 were evaluable for tumor response at equal to or more than 3 months postbaseline Median overall survival OS was comparable between treatment groups ADXS11-001 8.28 months 95 confidence interval CI 5.85-10.5 months ADXS11-001 cisplatin 8.78 months 95 CI 7.4-13.3 months The 12- and 18-month milestone OS rates were 30.9 versus 38.9 and 23.6 versus 25.9 for each group respectively 34.9 and 24.8 combined Median progression-free survival 6.10 vs 6.08 months and the overall response rate 17.1 vs 14.7 were similar for both groups ADXS11-001 was generally well tolerated adverse events were predominantly mild to moderate in severity and not related to treatment More adverse events were reported in the combination group 429 vs 275 These promising safety and efficacy results including the encouraging 12-month 34.9 combined OS rate warrant further investigation of ADXS11-001 for treatment of recurrent/refractory cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[8, 1648, 3715, 484, 594, 2481, 9, 323, 640, 9, 1882, 387, 15, 113, 12, 22, 7, 47, 8, 978, 358, 3399, 761, 2811, 47, 443, 721, 25, 1141, 9, 7, 5, 131, 2377, 1, 12, 72370, 72371, 20057, 144, 8, 14582, 16023, 726, 5, 8, 2094, 254, 23, 3, 250, 398, 16, 669, 940, 9, 24, 1, 171, 3242, 41, 163, 141, 12, 26, 124, 18, 45, 194, 3, 367, 2, 209, 1, 20057, 144, 468, 5, 15, 187, 540, 4, 7, 5, 387, 430, 12, 366, 324, 56, 2, 15, 310, 8, 181, 1, 3486, 7, 11, 73, 2, 790, 11, 859, 9, 30, 51, 28, 2997, 6, 15, 80, 76, 27, 53, 14958, 52, 63, 25, 118, 10, 1279, 59, 24, 271, 20057, 144, 66, 339, 53, 48, 307, 268, 58, 33, 772, 79, 33, 53, 20057, 144, 540, 66, 833, 53, 48, 58, 67, 39, 233, 27, 53, 3, 133, 2, 203, 811, 12821, 118, 151, 11, 201, 83, 185, 519, 83, 2, 382, 49, 185, 243, 83, 9, 296, 87, 106, 562, 83, 2, 259, 66, 397, 52, 91, 115, 25, 49, 79, 105, 49, 1592, 53, 2, 3, 63, 51, 116, 269, 14, 105, 213, 67, 11, 288, 9, 110, 271, 20057, 144, 10, 1228, 149, 421, 290, 281, 11, 2117, 1980, 6, 1163, 4, 1702, 2, 44, 139, 6, 24, 80, 290, 281, 11, 210, 4, 3, 150, 87, 8406, 105, 5620, 46, 721, 367, 2, 209, 99, 141, 3, 2269, 133, 811, 562, 83, 397, 118, 116, 2946, 195, 940, 1, 20057, 144, 9, 24, 1, 387, 430, 12]",1628.0,29538258,580
Knowledge and attitude of women attending Subharti Medical College towards Pap smear.,Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology : the journal of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,J Obstet Gynaecol,2018-03-19,"The aim of this prospective study was to assess the knowledge and attitude of women towards the Pap smear. It was carried out on the women coming to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at our University, with the help of a pre-formed questionnaire. We found that only 33% of the women were aware of the Pap smear, and of these hardly (10%) had the correct information. Sixty-five percent of the women said that they would have gotten the Pap smear done, if they had known about it earlier. Unless this knowledge amongst women is improved and their attitude is changed, the indices of cervical cancer cannot be improved. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? A Pap smear is used as a screening test to detect not only early stages of cervical cancer but also the precancerous conditions. A Pap smear is done every three years for routine screening, or every five years along with an HPV DNA test. What do the results of this study add? Despite the efforts from the medical fraternity and governments, the number of women undergoing this test in Uttar Pradesh is very minimal.

The impact of daily bladder filling on small bowel dose for intensity modulated radiation therapy for cervical cancer.,Medical dosimetry : official journal of the American Association of Medical Dosimetrists,Med Dosim,2018-03-21,"Research demonstrates that instructing patients to have a full bladder for pelvic radiotherapy results in highly variable bladder volumes at daily treatment. We aimed to determine bladder volume variation in patients with intact cervical cancer treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) on an empty bladder and estimate the difference in radiation dose to the small bowel compared to treating on a full bladder. We identified 29 patients treated with IMRT from 2010 to 2013 who underwent 2 planning computed tomography (CT) scans, 1 with a full bladder followed by 1 with an empty bladder. Interfractional variation in bladder volume was measured using 782 daily cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans. To estimate dose to small bowel, radiation plans were created on both empty and full bladder CT scans using an automated knowledge-based planning modeling program. Mean bladder volume with empty bladder instructions was 67 ± 26 cc compared to 91 ± 43 cc for no bladder instructions and 154 ± 54 cc for full bladder instructions (p < 0.001). There was a significant reduction in the absolute bladder volume variation in patients given empty bladder instructions compared to full bladder instructions (p < 0.05) The intraclass correlation coefficient showed low reliability of bladder filling across all groups (p = 0.6). The average bowel V45 for the empty bladder plans was 188 cc, compared to 139 cc for the full bladder plans (p < 0.05). More plans created on an empty bladder exceeded Quantitative Analyses of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic (QUANTEC) guidelines but this was not significant (31% vs 14%, p = 0.12). Reliability of bladder volume at the time of radiation treatment is low, regardless of bladder filling instructions, although an empty bladder reduces absolute variation in bladder volume. Radiation planning on an empty bladder predicts a larger volume of small bowel receiving 45 Gy compared to a full bladder, although bowel dose on average is still within QUANTEC guidelines (V45 < 195 cc).",Journal Article,671.0,2.0,Research demonstrates that instructing patients to have a full for pelvic radiotherapy results in highly variable volumes at daily treatment We aimed to determine volume variation in patients with intact cancer treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy IMRT on an empty and estimate the difference in radiation dose to the small bowel compared to treating on a full We identified 29 patients treated with IMRT from 2010 to 2013 who underwent 2 planning computed tomography CT scans 1 with a full followed by 1 with an empty Interfractional variation in volume was measured using 782 daily cone beam computed tomography CBCT scans To estimate dose to small bowel radiation plans were created on both empty and full CT scans using an automated knowledge-based planning modeling program Mean volume with empty instructions was 67 ± 26 cc compared to 91 ± 43 cc for no instructions and 154 ± 54 cc for full instructions p 0.001 There was a significant reduction in the absolute volume variation in patients given empty instructions compared to full instructions p 0.05 The intraclass correlation coefficient showed low reliability of filling across all groups p 0.6 The average bowel V45 for the empty plans was 188 cc compared to 139 cc for the full plans p 0.05 More plans created on an empty exceeded Quantitative Analyses of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic QUANTEC guidelines but this was not significant 31 vs 14 p 0.12 Reliability of volume at the time of radiation treatment is low regardless of filling instructions although an empty reduces absolute variation in volume Radiation planning on an empty predicts a larger volume of small bowel receiving 45 Gy compared to a full although bowel dose on average is still within QUANTEC guidelines V45 195 cc,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[389, 1902, 17, 72431, 7, 6, 47, 8, 1647, 9, 1110, 310, 99, 4, 561, 1347, 2225, 28, 391, 24, 21, 1295, 6, 223, 433, 1380, 4, 7, 5, 2964, 12, 73, 5, 837, 1757, 310, 964, 23, 35, 9436, 2, 1191, 3, 523, 4, 121, 61, 6, 3, 302, 1659, 72, 6, 1367, 23, 8, 1647, 21, 108, 462, 7, 73, 5, 964, 29, 1120, 6, 1346, 54, 208, 18, 1349, 1220, 872, 425, 1441, 14, 5, 8, 1647, 370, 20, 14, 5, 35, 9436, 15640, 1380, 4, 433, 10, 644, 75, 13587, 391, 6939, 1345, 1220, 872, 5187, 1441, 6, 1191, 61, 6, 302, 1659, 121, 1853, 11, 2466, 23, 110, 9436, 2, 1647, 425, 1441, 75, 35, 3235, 922, 90, 1349, 2057, 1243, 313, 433, 5, 9436, 14875, 10, 598, 810, 432, 1951, 72, 6, 970, 810, 601, 1951, 9, 77, 14875, 2, 4838, 810, 667, 1951, 9, 1647, 14875, 19, 13, 144, 125, 10, 8, 93, 628, 4, 3, 1766, 433, 1380, 4, 7, 447, 9436, 14875, 72, 6, 1647, 14875, 19, 13, 474, 3, 10892, 816, 3200, 224, 154, 4217, 1, 13930, 716, 62, 271, 19, 13, 49, 3, 1011, 1659, 16984, 9, 3, 9436, 1853, 10, 5664, 1951, 72, 6, 4929, 1951, 9, 3, 1647, 1853, 19, 13, 474, 80, 1853, 2466, 23, 35, 9436, 4726, 1156, 318, 1, 295, 246, 176, 4, 3, 1188, 25788, 677, 84, 26, 10, 44, 93, 456, 105, 213, 19, 13, 133, 4217, 1, 433, 28, 3, 98, 1, 121, 24, 16, 154, 1583, 1, 13930, 14875, 242, 35, 9436, 2389, 1766, 1380, 4, 433, 121, 1349, 23, 35, 9436, 2623, 8, 1077, 433, 1, 302, 1659, 357, 512, 381, 72, 6, 8, 1647, 242, 1659, 61, 23, 1011, 16, 1234, 262, 25788, 677, 16984, 5786, 1951]",1765.0,29573921,171

Using the National Cancer Database (2004-2014), we identified women diagnosed with endometrial, ovarian, cervical, and vulvar cancer. For each disease site, we analyzed race/ethnicity-specific trends in receipt of evidence-based practices. Professional societies' recommendations were used to define these practices. Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (2000-2009) we analyzed trends in 5-year survival. Throughout the study period black (64.8%) and Hispanic (68.3%) women were less likely to undergo lymphadenectomy for stage I ovarian cancer compared to Asian (79.5%) and white patients (74.6%). Black women were the least likely group to undergo lymphadenectomy in all periods. Among patients with stage II-IV ovarian cancer, 76.6% of white and Asian women received both surgery and chemotherapy, compared to 70.8% of black and 73.9% Hispanic women. Hispanic women with deeply invasive or high-grade stage I endometrial cancer underwent lymphadenectomy less frequently (74.5%) than all other groups (80.7%). Black women were less likely to have chemo-radiotherapy for stage IIB-IVA cervical cancer (75.6% versus 80.4% of all others). Black women were also less likely to have a surgical lymph node evaluation for vulvar cancer (58.8% versus 63.5% of all others).

Spermidine, a natural polyamine detected in all eukaryotic organisms, exhibits functions that promote longevity in multiple model systems and may constitute a promising agent for cancer treatment. However, the potential effectiveness of spermidine in cervical cancer has not yet been fully elucidated, and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we aimed to assess the effects of spermidine on proliferation and apoptosis of HeLa cells (a cervical cancer cell line). Firstly, CCK‑8 and flow cytometric assays revealed that spermidine reduced the proliferation of HeLa cells in a dose‑dependent fashion by arresting the cell cycle at the S phase. Secondly, flow cytometry incorporating Annexin V‑FITC/PI‑staining revealed that spermidine promoted the apoptosis of HeLa cells, and western blot analysis revealed that spermidine activated autophagy. Finally, spermidine‑activated autophagy mediated the inhibition of cell proliferation by spermidine and spermidine‑induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. Collectively, these results revealed a novel function for spermidine in inhibiting cellular proliferation and inducing apoptosis of HeLa cells by activating autophagy, which may have important implications for the use of spermidine in cervical cancer therapy.",Journal Article,643.0,1.0,cancer is the most common malignancy of the female reproductive tract and the poor response to prophylactic vaccines and the toxicity of high‑dose chemotherapeutic drugs have limited their clinical application Spermidine a natural polyamine detected in all eukaryotic organisms exhibits functions that promote longevity in multiple model systems and may constitute a promising agent for cancer treatment However the potential effectiveness of spermidine in cancer has not yet been fully elucidated and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear In the present study we aimed to assess the effects of spermidine on proliferation and apoptosis of HeLa cells a cancer cell line Firstly CCK‑8 and flow cytometric assays revealed that spermidine reduced the proliferation of HeLa cells in a dose‑dependent fashion by arresting the cell cycle at the S phase Secondly flow cytometry incorporating Annexin V‑FITC/PI‑staining revealed that spermidine promoted the apoptosis of HeLa cells and western blot analysis revealed that spermidine activated autophagy Finally spermidine‑activated autophagy mediated the inhibition of cell proliferation by spermidine and spermidine‑induced apoptosis in HeLa cells Collectively these results revealed a novel function for spermidine in inhibiting cellular proliferation and inducing apoptosis of HeLa cells by activating autophagy which may have important implications for the use of spermidine in cancer therapy,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[12, 16, 3, 96, 186, 710, 1, 3, 1061, 3705, 1696, 2, 3, 334, 51, 6, 1862, 1842, 2, 3, 155, 1, 72614, 1573, 600, 47, 383, 136, 38, 1581, 15528, 8, 1504, 11433, 530, 4, 62, 8374, 9694, 4273, 1681, 17, 1617, 15187, 4, 232, 202, 1530, 2, 68, 4999, 8, 721, 420, 9, 12, 24, 137, 3, 174, 1236, 1, 15528, 4, 12, 71, 44, 1145, 85, 1910, 3901, 2, 3, 1181, 219, 483, 918, 1200, 4, 3, 364, 45, 21, 1295, 6, 423, 3, 176, 1, 15528, 23, 457, 2, 351, 1, 8466, 37, 8, 12, 31, 328, 16535, 72615, 2, 1412, 6226, 1013, 553, 17, 15528, 405, 3, 457, 1, 8466, 37, 4, 8, 48387, 3240, 20, 18265, 3, 31, 417, 28, 3, 695, 124, 18904, 1412, 1914, 2570, 4850, 72616, 72617, 553, 17, 15528, 2992, 3, 351, 1, 8466, 37, 2, 1521, 2639, 65, 553, 17, 15528, 735, 2240, 1368, 72618, 2240, 517, 3, 297, 1, 31, 457, 20, 15528, 2, 72619, 351, 4, 8466, 37, 2535, 46, 99, 553, 8, 229, 343, 9, 15528, 4, 2062, 763, 457, 2, 1958, 351, 1, 8466, 37, 20, 1616, 2240, 92, 68, 47, 305, 1268, 9, 3, 119, 1, 15528, 4, 12, 36]",1451.0,29693131,424
HPV: Molecular pathways and targets.,Current problems in cancer,Curr Probl Cancer,2018-04-05,"Infection of high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) is a prerequisite for the development of cervical carcinoma. HPV infections are also implicated in the development of other types of carcinomas. Chronic or persistent infection of HPV is essential but HPV alone is inadequate, additional endogenous or exogenous cues are needed along with HPV to induce cervical carcinogenesis. The strategies that high-risk HPVs have developed in differentiating epithelial cells to reach a DNA-synthesis competent state leading to tumorigenic transformation are basically due to overexpression of the E6 and E7 oncoproteins and the activation of diverse cellular regulatory or signaling pathways that are targeted by them. Moreover, the Wnt/β-catenin/Notch and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathways are deregulated in various cancers, and have also been implicated in HPV-induced cancers. These are basically related to the ""cancer hallmarks,"" and include sustaining proliferative signals, the evasion of growth suppression and immune destruction, replicative immortality, inflammation, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis, as well as genome instability, resisting cell death, and deregulation of cellular energetics. These information could eventually aid in identifying or developing new diagnostic, prognostic biomarkers, and may contribute to design more effective targeted therapeutics and treatment strategies. Although surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy can cure more than 90% of women with early stage cervical cancer, the recurrent and metastatic disease remains a major cause of cancer mortality. Numerous efforts have been made to design new drugs and develop gene therapies to treat cervical cancer. In recent years, research on treatment strategies has proposed several options, including the role of HPV E5, E6, and E7 oncogenes, which are retained and overexpressed in most of the cervical cancers and whose respective oncoproteins are critical to the induction and maintenance of the malignant phenotype. Other efforts have been focused on antitumor immunotherapy strategies. It is known that during the development of cervical cancer, a cascade of abnormal events is induced, including disruption of cell cycle control, perturbation of antitumor immune response, alteration of gene expression, deregulation of microRNA and cancer stem cell and stemness related markers expression could serve as novel molecular targets for reliable diagnosis and treatment of HPV-positive cancers. However, the search for new proposals for disease control and prevention has brought new findings and approaches in the context of molecular biology indicating innovations and perspectives in the early detection and prevention of the disease.

Underutilization of brachytherapy and disparities in survival for patients with cervical cancer in California.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2018-04-27,"The treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer is external beam radiation (EBRT), concurrent chemotherapy, and brachytherapy (BT). We investigated demographic and socioeconomic factors that influence trends in BT utilization and disparities in survival. Using the California Cancer Registry, cervical cancer patients FIGO IB2-IVA from 2004 to 2014 were identified. We collected tumor, demographic and socioeconomic (SES) factors. We used multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine predictors of use of BT. Using Cox proportional hazards, we examined the impact of BT vs EBRT boost on cause specific (CSS) and overall survival (OS). We identified 4783 patients with FIGO stage 11% IB2; 32% II, 54% III, 3% IVA. Nearly half (45%) of patients were treated with BT, 18% were treated with a EBRT boost, and 37% had no boost. Stage II and III were more likely to be treated with BT (p = 0.002 and p = 0.0168) vs Stage IB2. As patients aged, the use of BT decreased. Using multivariate analysis, BT impacted CCS (HR 1.16, p = 0.0330) and OS (HR 1.14, p = 0.0333).

The role of bevacizumab on tumour angiogenesis and in the management of gynaecological cancers: A review.,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,Biomed. Pharmacother.,2018-04-05,"The study aims to analyze the effectiveness of bevacizumab in addressing the complications associated with gynecological cancers and evaluates effective treatments for various gynecological cancers. The study follows a systematic review approach that has been implemented to analyze the qualitative published data from previous studies. Studies related with the trials of angiogenesis and bevacizumab were selected in the review. In general, the management of gynecological cancers include chemotherapy, surgery and radiation therapy. Results suggest bevacizumab as an effective treatment modality for cervical and several other cancers. Overall, bevacizumab showed promising results in improving the overall survival rate of gynecological cancer patients through the combination of bevacizumab with other chemotherapeutic agents.

"Graphene oxide sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapeutics by inducing early autophagy events, promoting nuclear trafficking and necrosis.",Theranostics,Theranostics,2018-03-28,"<b>Rationale:</b> Cisplatin (CDDP) is a broad-spectrum anticancer drug but chemoresistance to CDDP impedes its wide use for cancer therapy. Autophagy is an event occurring in the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic LC3 puncta formation is a hallmark of autophagy. Graphene oxide (GO) is a nanomaterial that provokes autophagy in CT26 colon cancer cells and confers antitumor effects. Here we aimed to evaluate whether combined use of GO with CDDP (GO/CDDP) overcomes chemoresistance in different cancer cells and uncover the underlying mechanism. <b>Methods:</b> We treated different cancer cells with GO/CDDP and evaluated the cytotoxicity, death mechanism, autophagy induction and nuclear entry of CDDP. We further knocked down genes essential for autophagic flux and deciphered which step is critical to nuclear import and cell death. Finally, we performed immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry and immunofluorescence labeling to evaluate the association of LC3 and CDDP. <b>Results:</b> We uncovered that combination of GO and CDDP (GO/CDDP) promoted the killing of not only CT26 cells, but also ovarian, cervical and prostate cancer cells. In the highly chemosensitized Skov-3 cells, GO/CDDP significantly enhanced concurrent nuclear import of CDDP and autophagy marker LC3 and elevated cell necrosis, which required autophagy initiation and progression but did not necessitate late autophagy events (e.g., autophagosome completion and autolysosome formation). The GO/CDDP-elicited nuclear trafficking and cell death also required importin α/β, and LC3 also co-migrated with CDDP and histone H1/H4 into the nucleus. In particular, GO/CDDP triggered histone H4 acetylation in the nucleus, which could decondense the chromosome and enable CDDP to more effectively access chromosomal DNA to trigger cell death. <b>Conclusion:</b> These findings shed light on the mechanisms of GO/CDDP-induced chemosensitization and implicate the potential applications of GO/CDDP to treat multiple cancers.",Journal Article,664.0,9.0,b Rationale /b Cisplatin CDDP is a broad-spectrum anticancer drug but chemoresistance to CDDP impedes its wide use for cancer therapy Autophagy is an event occurring in the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic LC3 puncta formation is a hallmark of autophagy Graphene oxide GO is a nanomaterial that provokes autophagy in CT26 cancer cells and confers antitumor effects Here we aimed to evaluate whether combined use of GO with CDDP GO/CDDP overcomes chemoresistance in different cancer cells and uncover the underlying mechanism b Methods /b We treated different cancer cells with GO/CDDP and evaluated the cytotoxicity death mechanism autophagy induction and nuclear entry of CDDP We further knocked down genes essential for autophagic flux and deciphered which step is critical to nuclear import and cell death Finally we performed immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry and immunofluorescence labeling to evaluate the association of LC3 and CDDP b Results /b We uncovered that combination of GO and CDDP GO/CDDP promoted the killing of not only CT26 cells but also and cancer cells In the highly chemosensitized Skov-3 cells GO/CDDP significantly enhanced concurrent nuclear import of CDDP and autophagy marker LC3 and elevated cell necrosis which required autophagy initiation and progression but did not necessitate late autophagy events e.g. autophagosome completion and autolysosome formation The GO/CDDP-elicited nuclear trafficking and cell death also required importin α/β and LC3 also co-migrated with CDDP and histone H1/H4 into the nucleus In particular GO/CDDP triggered histone H4 acetylation in the nucleus which could decondense the chromosome and enable CDDP to more effectively access chromosomal DNA to trigger cell death b Conclusion /b These findings shed light on the mechanisms of GO/CDDP-induced chemosensitization and implicate the potential applications of GO/CDDP to treat multiple cancers,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[132, 1728, 132, 540, 5820, 16, 8, 2094, 1873, 1475, 234, 84, 3782, 6, 5820, 20745, 211, 1019, 119, 9, 12, 36, 2240, 16, 35, 774, 1821, 4, 3, 4558, 2, 2828, 7568, 23706, 1264, 16, 8, 4683, 1, 2240, 23607, 6608, 3537, 16, 8, 24016, 17, 24597, 2240, 4, 9564, 12, 37, 2, 4020, 579, 176, 467, 21, 1295, 6, 376, 317, 397, 119, 1, 3537, 5, 5820, 3537, 5820, 8510, 3782, 4, 338, 12, 37, 2, 6281, 3, 1181, 670, 132, 636, 132, 21, 73, 338, 12, 37, 5, 3537, 5820, 2, 194, 3, 1408, 273, 670, 2240, 504, 2, 928, 3001, 1, 5820, 21, 195, 10237, 1328, 214, 1452, 9, 8810, 9876, 2, 26761, 92, 2458, 16, 740, 6, 928, 13849, 2, 31, 273, 1368, 21, 173, 4857, 782, 3680, 2, 4130, 3383, 6, 376, 3, 248, 1, 7568, 2, 5820, 132, 99, 132, 21, 5601, 17, 150, 1, 3537, 2, 5820, 3537, 5820, 2992, 3, 3003, 1, 44, 158, 9564, 37, 84, 120, 2, 12, 37, 4, 3, 561, 72676, 12393, 27, 37, 3537, 5820, 97, 651, 750, 928, 13849, 1, 5820, 2, 2240, 952, 7568, 2, 804, 31, 1523, 92, 616, 2240, 1118, 2, 91, 84, 205, 44, 12084, 807, 2240, 281, 563, 499, 21388, 1438, 2, 72677, 1264, 3, 3537, 5820, 5179, 928, 6105, 2, 31, 273, 120, 616, 22683, 2014, 1458, 2, 7568, 120, 1269, 15487, 5, 5820, 2, 1508, 5199, 7812, 237, 3, 4262, 4, 1454, 3537, 5820, 4173, 1508, 7812, 4145, 4, 3, 4262, 92, 359, 72678, 3, 1170, 2, 3047, 5820, 6, 80, 1856, 1655, 1860, 261, 6, 5781, 31, 273, 132, 1221, 132, 46, 272, 5816, 1691, 23, 3, 483, 1, 3537, 5820, 277, 13594, 2, 5545, 3, 174, 2911, 1, 3537, 5820, 6, 943, 232, 163]",1905.0,29721093,55

Brain-stem hemangioblastomas: The seemingly innocuous lesion in a perilous location.,Neurology India,Neurol India,,"Hemangioblastomas [75% sporadic, 25% with Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease] are highly vascular, benign lesions. The surgical nuances, management, and complication avoidance in brain-stem hemangioblastomas (BHs) have been studied. Over 18 years, 27(mean age: 29 years; range 15-60 years) consecutive cases of BH underwent microsurgical excision. All patients were assessed clinico-radiologically for neurological deficits and screened for VHL disease. Outcome of the patients was based on Karnofsky Performance Status scale (KPS). 12 out of 19 (70.4%) patients with hydrocephalus underwent a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion procedure. Lower cranial nerve palsy was present in 10 (37%) patients and motor weakness in 13 (48%). The tumours [mean size 3.34 ± 1.06 cm, range: 1.4-5.5 cm; 11 solid, rest solid-cystic; 18 (66.7%) subpial and 9 (33.33%) intramedullary] were divided into four categories based on size: A: <2 cm (n = 5,18.5%); B: 2-3 cm (n = 10,37%); C: 3-4 cm (n = 6,22.2%); D: >4 cm (n = 6,22.2%). Their location was at posterior cervicomedullary junction (n = 12); pontomedullary junction (n = 7); pons (n = 3), medulla (n = 3) and ponto-mesencephalic region (n = 2). Multiple flow voids were seen in >50% patients with tumour >2 cm. 5 patients had syringomyelia; and, 8 had diffuse cervical cord expansion. Two patients with a large vascular tumour underwent preoperative embolization. Six patients had VHL disease; one underwent bilateral adrenalectomy for refractory hypertension; and, the another, nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma. Twenty-six patients underwent a midline suboccipital craniectomy; and, 1 with a cerebellopontine angle tumour, a retromastoid craniectomy. 15 patients underwent total excision; 10 patients, near-total (<10% remaining) excision, and 2 patients, a subtotal (>10% remaining)) excision. Three patients (2 with VHL disease) expired due to exsanguinating hemorrhage, spreading venous thrombosis and aspiration pneumonitis, respectively. At follow-up visit (median: 25 ± interquartile range 2-56months), 17 patients had improved KPS, 4 remained in same status and 3 (recently operated, on tracheostomy) had worsened KPS.

Less versus more radical surgery in stage IB1 cervical cancer: A population-based study of long-term survival.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2018-07-01,"Standard surgical treatment for women with stage IB1 cervical cancer consists of radical hysterectomy. This study assesses survival outcomes of those treated with less radical surgery (LRS; conization, trachelectomy, simple hysterectomy) compared to more radical surgery (MRS; modified radical, radical hysterectomy). Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database, we identified women <45 years with FIGO stage IB1 cervical cancer diagnosed from 1/1998 to 12/2012. Only those who underwent lymph node (LN) assessment were analyzed. Disease-specific survivals (DSSs) of LRS were compared with those of MRS. Of 2571 patients, 807 underwent LRS and 1764 underwent MRS, all with LN assessment. For LRS vs. MRS, 28% vs. 23% were diagnosed with adenocarcinoma (p = 0.024), 31% vs. 39% had G3 disease (p < 0.001), 40% vs. 45% had tumor size >2 cm (p < 0.001), and 27% vs. 29% received adjuvant radiation therapy (p = 0.005). Median follow-up was 79 months (range, 0-179). Ten-year DSS for LRS vs. MRS was 93.5% vs. 92.3% (p = 0.511).

Comprehensive pharmacogenomic profiling of human papillomavirus-positive and -negative squamous cell carcinoma identifies sensitivity to aurora kinase inhibition in KMT2D mutants.,Cancer letters,Cancer Lett.,2018-05-25,"To address the unmet need for effective biomarker-driven targeted therapy for human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and cervical cancer, we conducted a high-throughput drug screen using 1122 compounds in 13 HPV-positive and 11 matched HPV-negative cell lines. The most effective drug classes were inhibitors of polo-like kinase, proteasomes, histone deacetylase, and Aurora kinases. Treatment with a pan-Aurora inhibitor, danusertib, led to G2M arrest and apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, danusertib decreased tumor size compared with controls in patient derived xenograft models of HNSCC. To identify biomarkers predicting response, we determined associations between mutations and drug sensitivity. Our data and the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database showed that cancer cells with KMT2D mutations were more sensitive to Aurora kinase inhibitors than were cells without mutations. Knockdown of KMT2D in wild-type cells led to increased Aurora kinase inhibitor-induced apoptosis. We identified Aurora kinase inhibitors as effective and understudied drugs in HNSCC and CESC. This is the first published study to demonstrate that mutations in KMT2D, which are common in many cancers, correlate with drug sensitivity in two independent datasets.",Journal Article,606.0,6.0,To address the unmet need for effective biomarker-driven targeted therapy for human papillomavirus HPV -associated head and squamous cell carcinoma HNSCC and cancer we conducted a high-throughput drug screen using 1122 compounds in 13 HPV-positive and 11 matched HPV-negative cell lines The most effective drug classes were inhibitors of polo-like kinase proteasomes histone deacetylase and Aurora kinases Treatment with a pan-Aurora inhibitor danusertib led to G2M arrest and apoptosis in vitro Furthermore danusertib decreased tumor size compared with controls in patient derived xenograft models of HNSCC To identify biomarkers predicting response we determined associations between mutations and drug sensitivity Our data and the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database showed that cancer cells with KMT2D mutations were more sensitive to Aurora kinase inhibitors than were cells without mutations Knockdown of KMT2D in wild-type cells led to increased Aurora kinase inhibitor-induced apoptosis We identified Aurora kinase inhibitors as effective and understudied drugs in HNSCC and CESC This is the first published study to demonstrate that mutations in KMT2D which are common in many cancers correlate with drug sensitivity in two independent datasets,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[6, 1539, 3, 3715, 594, 9, 323, 901, 1621, 238, 36, 9, 171, 3242, 933, 41, 718, 2, 691, 31, 134, 1209, 2, 12, 21, 426, 8, 64, 3643, 234, 2413, 75, 23306, 2411, 4, 233, 933, 109, 2, 175, 655, 933, 199, 31, 285, 3, 96, 323, 234, 3211, 11, 222, 1, 12635, 733, 216, 24715, 1508, 2732, 2, 4095, 1549, 24, 5, 8, 3055, 4095, 230, 20672, 836, 6, 26151, 1854, 2, 351, 4, 439, 798, 20672, 340, 30, 444, 72, 5, 535, 4, 69, 526, 1330, 274, 1, 1209, 6, 255, 582, 1434, 51, 21, 509, 685, 59, 138, 2, 234, 485, 114, 74, 2, 3, 4229, 1, 234, 485, 4, 12, 609, 224, 17, 12, 37, 5, 14715, 138, 11, 80, 745, 6, 4095, 216, 222, 76, 11, 37, 187, 138, 1563, 1, 14715, 4, 955, 267, 37, 836, 6, 101, 4095, 216, 230, 277, 351, 21, 108, 4095, 216, 222, 22, 323, 2, 8207, 600, 4, 1209, 2, 24303, 26, 16, 3, 157, 983, 45, 6, 608, 17, 138, 4, 14715, 92, 32, 186, 4, 445, 163, 1513, 5, 234, 485, 4, 100, 306, 3455]",1265.0,29807113,481
Disparities Predict for Higher Rates of Cut-through Hysterectomies in Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer.,American journal of clinical oncology,Am. J. Clin. Oncol.,2019-01-01,"The treatment of choice for locally advanced cervical cancer is definitive chemoradiation (CRT). Hysterectomy is not indicated due to higher-rates of cut-through resections leaving gross disease behind, requiring additional therapy with increasing morbidity and no benefit in overall survival (OS). The objectives of this study were to determine factors associated with cut-through hysterectomies and evaluate OS outcomes. The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried for patients 18 years and older with clinical Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IB2 to IVA. All patients underwent upfront hysterectomy and had known margin status. Cut-through hysterectomy was classified as presence of microscopic or macroscopic disease at the margin. A total of 11,638 patients were included; 993 (8.5%) had positive margins. In patients with positive margins, 560 (56.4%) received postoperative CRT and 148 (14.9%) underwent postoperative radiation. Five-year OS was worse for those with cut-through resections when compared with those with negative margins, 66.0% versus 86.7%, respectively (hazard ratios, 3.08; P<0.001). Under multiple logistic regression, African American race (odds ratio [OR], 1.45; P=0.001), older age (OR per year increase, 1.03; P<0.001), patients with government insurance (OR, 1.21; P=0.019), and those treated at community practices (OR, 1.31; P=0.001) were more likely to undergo cut-through hysterectomies.

"A compact, low-cost, quantitative and multiplexed fluorescence detection platform for point-of-care applications.",Biosensors & bioelectronics,Biosens Bioelectron,2018-04-04,"An effective method of combating infectious diseases is the deployment of hand-held devices at the point-of-care (POC) for screening or self-monitoring applications. There is a need for very sensitive, low-cost and quantitative diagnostic devices. In this study, we present a low-cost, multiplexed fluorescence detection platform that has a high sensitivity and wide dynamic range. Our system features inexpensive 3 × 3 mm interference filters with a high stopband rejection, sharp transition edges, and greater than 90% transmission in the passband. In addition to the filters, we improve signal-to-noise ratio by leveraging time for accuracy using a charge-integration-based readout. The fluorescence sensing platform provides a sensitivity to photon flux of ∼1×10<sup>4</sup>photons/mm<sup>2</sup>sec and has the potential for 2-3 orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity over standard colorimetric detection that uses colored latex microspheres. We also detail the design, development, and characterization of our low-cost fluorescence detection platform and demonstrate 100% and 97.96% reduction in crosstalk probability and filter cost, respectively. This is achieved by reducing filter dimensions and ensuring appropriate channel isolation in a 2 × 2 array configuration. Practical considerations with low-cost interference filter system design, analysis, and system performance are also discussed.

Cervical cancer has decreased due to screening, early detection, and treatment of pre-invasive cancers. However, ovarian cancer remains the most lethal because of advanced stage at diagnosis and drug resistance. The metastatic spread pattern differs amongst these cancers, with uterine and cervical cancer found mostly in the primary organ and ovarian cancer disseminating throughout the peritoneum and upper abdomen at presentation. The primary treatment of ovarian cancer typically involves surgery followed by systemic therapy for more advanced disease.

Cervical cancer care in rural Virginia: The impact of distance from an academic medical center on outcomes & the role of non-specialized radiation centers.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2018-06-21,"To determine whether distance to a tertiary care facility affects outcomes for locally advanced cervical cancer and to evaluate the impact of receiving care at non-specialized centers in rural communities. Retrospective, single institution study of patients with locally advanced cervical cancer managed with chemo-radiation from January 1, 2000 to June 1, 2014. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare progression free and overall survival for patients by median distance to the tertiary care facility (<72 miles or >72 miles) and facility where treatment was received. 180 patients met inclusion criteria. There was no difference in PFS or OS between the travel distance cohorts. When compared by location of external beam radiation, patients treated at outside facilities were older (p = 0.02) and significantly more likely to be insured (95.6% versus 71.7%, p < 0.0002). There were more recurrences among patients treated at outside facilities (31.1% versus 15.8%) but this was non-significant (p = 0.24). On multivariable analysis, FIGO stage and insurance status were associated with overall survival.

Proliferative role of BDNF/TrkB signaling is associated with anoikis resistance in cervical cancer.,Oncology reports,Oncol. Rep.,2018-06-20,"Brain‑derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is known as one of the members of the neurotropin family. BDNF‑induced activation of its receptor tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) is associated with anoikis tolerance, tumor progression and poor prognosis in many types of malignancy. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports describing the contribution of the BDNF/TrkB axis to cervical cancer. BDNF and TrKB expression in cervical cancer (CC) tissues and adjacent normal tissues from 87 patients were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, western blot analysis and quantitative PCR assays and the results showed that they were significantly higher in cancer tissues than that in normal adjacent tissues, respectively. Higher expression rates of BDNF and TrKB were observed in stage IIB or higher and BDNF expression was positively associated with lymph node metastasis. Notably, a high expression of TrKB may be contributed to poor survival time, which confirmed by Kaplan‑Meier analysis. Compared to the corresponding CC cell lines, HeLa, SiHa, CASKI, C4‑1 and C‑33a, BDNF and TrKB expression was enhanced in anoikis‑like apoptotic tolerance (AAT), a cell model established from cervical cancer cell lines. AAT cells showed a higher proliferation activity compared with CC cell lines, which was confirmed by a shorter G0/G1 phase, elevated cyclin A, cyclin D1 and c‑myc, decreased caspase‑3 and Bax, and increased Bcl‑2. By contrast, the knockdown of TrKB expression reversed these changes in AAT cells, induced G0/G1 arrest and suppressed proliferation activity. The results of the present study show that PI3K/Akt signaling is involved in the BDNF/TrKB‑induced proliferation of AAT cells in cervical cancer. These findings indicate that BDNF/TrKB pathway is a potential target for the treatment of cervical cancer.",Journal Article,580.0,2.0,Brain‑derived neurotrophic factor BDNF is known as one of the members of the neurotropin family BDNF‑induced activation of its receptor tyrosine kinase B TrkB is associated with anoikis tolerance tumor progression and poor prognosis in many types of malignancy However to the best of our knowledge there are no reports describing the contribution of the BDNF/TrkB axis to cancer BDNF and TrKB expression in cancer CC tissues and adjacent normal tissues from 87 patients were analyzed by immunohistochemistry western blot analysis and quantitative PCR assays and the results showed that they were significantly higher in cancer tissues than that in normal adjacent tissues respectively Higher expression rates of BDNF and TrKB were observed in stage IIB or higher and BDNF expression was positively associated with lymph node metastasis Notably a high expression of TrKB may be contributed to poor survival time which confirmed by Kaplan‑Meier analysis Compared to the corresponding CC cell lines HeLa SiHa CASKI C4‑1 and C‑33a BDNF and TrKB expression was enhanced in anoikis‑like apoptotic tolerance AAT a cell model established from cancer cell lines AAT cells showed a higher proliferation activity compared with CC cell lines which was confirmed by a shorter G0/G1 phase elevated cyclin A cyclin D1 and c‑myc decreased caspase‑3 and Bax and increased Bcl‑2 By contrast the knockdown of TrKB expression reversed these changes in AAT cells induced G0/G1 arrest and suppressed proliferation activity The results of the present study show that PI3K/Akt signaling is involved in the BDNF/TrKB‑induced proliferation of AAT cells in cancer These findings indicate that BDNF/TrKB pathway is a potential target for the treatment of cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[73201, 12967, 161, 12934, 16, 440, 22, 104, 1, 3, 1684, 1, 3, 73202, 607, 73203, 363, 1, 211, 153, 564, 216, 132, 8880, 16, 41, 5, 7817, 2614, 30, 91, 2, 334, 356, 4, 445, 630, 1, 710, 137, 6, 3, 824, 1, 114, 922, 125, 32, 77, 1198, 4950, 3, 2925, 1, 3, 12934, 8880, 2310, 6, 12, 12934, 2, 8880, 55, 4, 12, 1951, 742, 2, 2086, 295, 742, 29, 912, 7, 11, 311, 20, 888, 1521, 2639, 65, 2, 1156, 604, 1013, 2, 3, 99, 224, 17, 491, 11, 97, 142, 4, 12, 742, 76, 17, 4, 295, 2086, 742, 106, 142, 55, 151, 1, 12934, 2, 8880, 11, 164, 4, 82, 3884, 15, 142, 2, 12934, 55, 10, 2375, 41, 5, 263, 289, 278, 2552, 8, 64, 55, 1, 8880, 68, 40, 3447, 6, 334, 25, 98, 92, 557, 20, 36322, 65, 72, 6, 3, 1734, 1951, 31, 285, 8466, 19043, 27417, 73204, 2, 73205, 12934, 2, 8880, 55, 10, 651, 4, 73206, 1631, 2614, 19665, 8, 31, 202, 635, 29, 12, 31, 285, 19665, 37, 224, 8, 142, 457, 128, 72, 5, 1951, 31, 285, 92, 10, 557, 20, 8, 985, 8588, 3344, 124, 804, 1226, 8, 1226, 2146, 2, 73207, 340, 51153, 2, 3119, 2, 101, 42103, 20, 748, 3, 1563, 1, 8880, 55, 3682, 46, 400, 4, 19665, 37, 277, 8588, 3344, 1854, 2, 1908, 457, 128, 3, 99, 1, 3, 364, 45, 514, 17, 974, 649, 314, 16, 646, 4, 3, 12934, 73208, 457, 1, 19665, 37, 4, 12, 46, 272, 1008, 17, 12934, 8880, 308, 16, 8, 174, 283, 9, 3, 24, 1, 12]",1733.0,29989647,559
Patient-Reported Toxicity During Pelvic Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy: NRG Oncology-RTOG 1203.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2018-07-10,"Purpose NRG Oncology/RTOG 1203 was designed to compare patient-reported acute toxicity and health-related quality of life during treatment with standard pelvic radiation or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in women with cervical and endometrial cancer. Methods Patients were randomly assigned to standard four-field radiation therapy (RT) or IMRT radiation treatment. The primary end point was change in patient-reported acute GI toxicity from baseline to the end of RT, measured with the bowel domain of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC). Secondary end points included change in patient-reported urinary toxicity, change in GI toxicity measured with the Patient-Reported Outcome Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, and quality of life measured with the Trial Outcome Index. Results From 2012 to 2015, 289 patients were enrolled, of whom 278 were eligible. Between baseline and end of RT, the mean EPIC bowel score declined 23.6 points in the standard RT group and 18.6 points in the IMRT group ( P = .048), the mean EPIC urinary score declined 10.4 points in the standard RT group and 5.6 points in the IMRT group ( P = .03), and the mean Trial Outcome Index score declined 12.8 points in the standard RT group and 8.8 points in the IMRT group ( P = .06). At the end of RT, 51.9% of women who received standard RT and 33.7% who received IMRT reported frequent or almost constant diarrhea ( P = .01), and more patients who received standard RT were taking antidiarrheal medications four or more times daily (20.4% v 7.8%; P = .04).

The HGT-ID workflow primarily follows a four-step procedure: i) pre-processing of unaligned reads, ii) virus detection using subtraction approach, iii) identification of virus integration site using discordant and soft-clipped reads and iv) HGT candidates prioritization through a scoring function. Annotation and visualization of the events, as well as primer design for experimental validation, are also provided in the final report. We evaluated the tool performance with the well-understood cervical cancer samples. The HGT-ID workflow accurately detected known human papillomavirus (HPV) integration sites with high sensitivity and specificity compared to previous HGT methods. We applied HGT-ID to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) whole-genome sequencing data (WGS) from liver tumor-normal pairs. Multiple hepatitis B virus (HBV) integration sites were identified in TCGA liver samples and confirmed by HGT-ID using the RNA-Seq data from the matched liver pairs. This shows the applicability of the method in both the data types and cross-validation of the HGT events in liver samples. We also processed 220 breast tumor WGS data through the workflow; however, there were no HGT events detected in those samples. HGT-ID is a novel computational workflow to detect the integration of viruses in the human genome using the sequencing data. It is fast and accurate with functions such as prioritization, annotation, visualization and primer design for future validation of HGTs.

Kinetics of Intratumoral Immune Cell Activation During Chemoradiation for Cervical Cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2018-07-12,"Radiation therapy has direct cytotoxic effects on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, but it also has immune stimulatory effects that increase immune cell infiltration. The dynamics of these competing effects on immune cells at the site of the tumor are poorly characterized during chemoradiation treatment (CRT) because of the difficulty of obtaining consecutive tumor biopsies. We used a minimally invasive cervical cytobrushing method to analyze the kinetics of intratumoral immune cell changes in patients with cervical cancer during CRT. Cervical brushings were obtained from 20 patients with cervical cancer at baseline and during fractionated radiation therapy and cisplatin (weeks 1, 3, and 5). Matching peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from 9 patients at the same time points. Cells were analyzed using multispectral flow cytometry to identify T cell and myeloid cell subsets and their activation status. Changes in immune cell subsets throughout treatment were calculated using matched-pair analysis with Wilcoxon rank sum test. We observed a significant decline in CD3+ total T cells, as well as CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell subsets in the first week of treatment from baseline, followed by variable expansion at weeks 3 and 5. This coincided with higher levels of proliferating CD8+ T cells expressing Ki67 at week 3 of treatment. The percentages of activated CD8+ T cells expressing CD69 continuously increased over the course of treatment, whereas the percentage of activated CD11c+CD11b- dendritic cells was highest during the first week. Many of these changes were not observed in the blood. Our results identified immune dynamic changes during CRT, indicating that CRT may be immune activating at the site of the tumor. This study also suggests the importance of sequential analyses of the local tumor microenvironment in addition to peripheral blood.",Journal Article,558.0,2.0,Radiation therapy has direct cytotoxic effects on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes but it also has immune stimulatory effects that increase immune cell infiltration The dynamics of these competing effects on immune cells at the site of the tumor are poorly characterized during chemoradiation treatment CRT because of the difficulty of obtaining consecutive tumor biopsies We used a minimally invasive cytobrushing method to analyze the kinetics of intratumoral immune cell changes in patients with cancer during CRT brushings were obtained from 20 patients with cancer at baseline and during fractionated radiation therapy and cisplatin weeks 1 3 and 5 Matching peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from 9 patients at the same time points Cells were analyzed using multispectral flow cytometry to identify T cell and myeloid cell subsets and their activation status Changes in immune cell subsets throughout treatment were calculated using matched-pair analysis with Wilcoxon rank sum test We observed a significant decline in CD3+ total T cells as well as CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell subsets in the first week of treatment from baseline followed by variable expansion at weeks 3 and 5 This coincided with higher levels of proliferating CD8+ T cells expressing Ki67 at week 3 of treatment The percentages of activated CD8+ T cells expressing CD69 continuously increased over the course of treatment whereas the percentage of activated CD11c+CD11b- dendritic cells was highest during the first week Many of these changes were not observed in the blood Our results identified immune dynamic changes during CRT indicating that CRT may be immune activating at the site of the tumor This study also suggests the importance of sequential analyses of the local tumor microenvironment in addition to peripheral blood,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[121, 36, 71, 1196, 759, 176, 23, 30, 2097, 1594, 84, 192, 120, 71, 250, 6708, 176, 17, 344, 250, 31, 2084, 3, 5193, 1, 46, 2573, 176, 23, 250, 37, 28, 3, 606, 1, 3, 30, 32, 1240, 765, 190, 975, 24, 1089, 408, 1, 3, 4035, 1, 5244, 935, 30, 1154, 21, 95, 8, 2144, 416, 73247, 596, 6, 1992, 3, 3839, 1, 2074, 250, 31, 400, 4, 7, 5, 12, 190, 1089, 14515, 11, 683, 29, 179, 7, 5, 12, 28, 330, 2, 190, 3950, 121, 36, 2, 540, 244, 14, 27, 2, 33, 2616, 672, 315, 3041, 37, 11, 683, 29, 83, 7, 28, 3, 827, 98, 862, 37, 11, 311, 75, 18997, 1412, 1914, 6, 255, 102, 31, 2, 533, 31, 1890, 2, 136, 363, 156, 400, 4, 250, 31, 1890, 2432, 24, 11, 981, 75, 655, 4767, 65, 5, 3896, 1026, 3216, 412, 21, 164, 8, 93, 1858, 4, 3117, 181, 102, 37, 22, 149, 22, 968, 2, 1440, 102, 31, 1890, 4, 3, 157, 647, 1, 24, 29, 330, 370, 20, 1347, 1422, 28, 244, 27, 2, 33, 26, 13050, 5, 142, 148, 1, 5639, 968, 102, 37, 1046, 3654, 28, 647, 27, 1, 24, 3, 5504, 1, 735, 968, 102, 37, 1046, 16337, 4285, 101, 252, 3, 906, 1, 24, 547, 3, 1150, 1, 735, 12513, 6861, 2464, 37, 10, 1076, 190, 3, 157, 647, 445, 1, 46, 400, 11, 44, 164, 4, 3, 315, 114, 99, 108, 250, 2540, 400, 190, 1089, 1716, 17, 1089, 68, 40, 250, 1616, 28, 3, 606, 1, 3, 30, 26, 45, 120, 844, 3, 1187, 1, 1787, 318, 1, 3, 293, 30, 995, 4, 352, 6, 672, 315]",1812.0,30017792,684
Conservative management of cervical cancer: Current status and obstetrical implications.,Best practice & research. Clinical obstetrics & gynaecology,Best Pract Res Clin Obstet Gynaecol,2018-06-28,"Recent advances in screening and early diagnosis have decreased cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates in high-resource settings. The postponement of childbearing, combined with an increased number of cervical cancer survivors, has yielded new paradigms in patient care. In recent years, radical surgery has been challenged as the standard of care for early-stage cervical cancer owing to its significant morbidity and fertility impairment. Attention has been directed to assessing more conservative procedures that can reduce treatment-induced morbidity without compromising oncologic safety and reproductive potential of patients with early-stage disease. In those with more advanced disease, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by conservative surgery has also been considered. These conservative treatment modalities including cervical conization, simple trachelectomy, and simple hysterectomy have been studied in various settings. In this chapter, we discuss the role of conservative surgery in the management of cervical cancer and the resulting obstetrical outcomes.",Journal Article,572.0,3.0,Recent advances in screening and early diagnosis have decreased cancer incidence and mortality rates in high-resource settings The postponement of childbearing combined with an increased number of cancer survivors has yielded new paradigms in patient care In recent years radical surgery has been challenged as the standard of care for early-stage cancer owing to its significant morbidity and fertility impairment Attention has been directed to assessing more conservative procedures that can reduce treatment-induced morbidity without compromising oncologic safety and reproductive potential of patients with early-stage disease In those with more advanced disease neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by conservative surgery has also been considered These conservative treatment modalities including conization simple trachelectomy and simple hysterectomy have been studied in various settings In this chapter we discuss the role of conservative surgery in the management of cancer and the resulting obstetrical outcomes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[435, 954, 4, 453, 2, 191, 147, 47, 340, 12, 287, 2, 282, 151, 4, 64, 3069, 1947, 3, 40908, 1, 10278, 397, 5, 35, 101, 207, 1, 12, 332, 71, 2178, 217, 4887, 4, 69, 165, 4, 435, 60, 711, 152, 71, 85, 6389, 22, 3, 260, 1, 165, 9, 191, 82, 12, 3421, 6, 211, 93, 787, 2, 2954, 2315, 2111, 71, 85, 1166, 6, 1977, 80, 4476, 1369, 17, 122, 969, 24, 277, 787, 187, 6102, 1998, 367, 2, 3705, 174, 1, 7, 5, 191, 82, 34, 4, 135, 5, 80, 131, 34, 536, 56, 370, 20, 4476, 152, 71, 120, 85, 515, 46, 4476, 24, 1558, 141, 8755, 2763, 5760, 2, 2763, 2622, 47, 85, 656, 4, 747, 1947, 4, 26, 6366, 21, 1139, 3, 200, 1, 4476, 152, 4, 3, 284, 1, 12, 2, 3, 1113, 21031, 123]",1020.0,30029960,131
Long-Term Oncologic Outcomes of Uterine-Preserving Surgery in Young Women With Stage Ib1 Cervical Cancer.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2018-09-01,"This study aimed to evaluate oncologic outcomes of women with stage IB1 cervical cancer treated with uterine-preserving surgery (UPS) (defined as conization or trachelectomy) versus non-UPS (defined as hysterectomy of any type). The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was used to identify women younger than 45 years diagnosed with stage IB1 cervical cancer from 1998 to 2012. Only those who underwent lymph node (LN) assessment were included. Outcomes of UPS versus non-UPS were analyzed. Among 2717 patients, 125 were treated with UPS and 2592 were treated with non-UPS. Those in the UPS group were younger (median age 33 vs 37 years, P < 0.001), less commonly had tumor size greater than 2 cm (27% vs 45%, P < 0.001), and less commonly received adjuvant radiation therapy (18% vs 29%, P = 0.006). There was no difference in distribution of tumor grade, histology, or rate of LN positivity. Median follow-up was 79 months (range, 0-179). There was no difference in 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) between the UPS versus non-UPS groups (93% vs 94%, respectively, P = 0.755). When stratified by tumor size, DSS for UPS versus non-UPS was as follows: tumors 2 cm or less, 96.8% versus 96.3% (P = 0.683); tumors greater than 2 cm, 82.4% versus 90.4% (P = 0.112). Factors independently associated with worsened survival included adenosquamous histology (hazard ratio [HR] 2.29, 95% confidence interval [CI]1.51-3.47), G3 disease (HR 2.44, 95% CI 1.01-5.89), tumor size greater than 2 cm (HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.36-2.75) and LN positivity (HR 2.29, 95% CI 1.64-3.22).

Standard Chemoradiation and Conventional Brachytherapy for Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer: Is It Still Applicable in the Era of Magnetic Resonance-Based Brachytherapy?,Journal of global oncology,J Glob Oncol,2018-07-01,"Purpose Recent guidelines recommend magnetic resonance imaging-based brachytherapy (MRBT) for locally advanced cervical cancer. However, its implementation is challenging within the developing world. This article reports the outcomes of patients with locally advanced cervical cancer treated with chemoradiation and point A-based brachytherapy (BT) using x-ray- or computed tomography-based planning. Methods Patients treated between January 2014 and December 2015 were included. Patients underwent x-ray- or computed tomography-based BT planning with an aim to deliver equivalent doses in 2 Gy (EQD2) > 84 Gy<sub>10</sub> to point A while minimizing maximum dose received by rectum or bladder to a point or 2 cc volume to < 75 Gy EQD2 and < 90 Gy EQD2, respectively<sub>.</sub> The impact of known prognostic factors was evaluated. Results A total of 339 patients were evaluated. Median age was 52 (32 to 81) years; 52% of patients had stage IB2 to IIB and 48% had stage III to IVA disease. There was 85% compliance with chemoradiation, and 87% of patients received four or more cycles. Median point A dose was 84 (64.8 to 89.7) Gy.

Frozen Section for Detection of Lymph Nodes After Cervical Injection with Indocyanine Green (ICG) for Sentinel Lymph Node Technique in Endometrial Cancer Staging.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2018-08-16,"The aim of this study was to assess the role of frozen section (FS) in identifying an absence of lymph nodes during sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy for apparent early-stage endometrial cancer (EC). Consecutive apparent early-stage EC patients who had SLNs removed after cervical injection with indocyanine green (ICG) from 1 June 2014 to 30 June 2016 were analyzed. An empty node (EN) was defined as an SLN specimen without evidence of lymph node(s). The association of tumor and patient characteristics with an EN was evaluated, and trend analysis to compare the rate of ENs over calendar quarters was performed. A decision-tree model was then created to compare the use of FS versus no FS for SLN evaluation in the hypothetical cohort affected by early-stage EC in the US each year. Over the study period, 300 patients met the inclusion criteria. FS revealed ENs in 24 (8%) patients. No association between patient demographic characteristics (age, body mass index, prior abdominopelvic surgery, international federation of gynecology and obstetrics (FIGO) stage, histology, myometrial invasion, cervical stromal invasion) and presence of ENs was observed. The rate of ENs at FS did not change over time (p = 0.68).

Characteristics and outcomes of reproductive-aged women with early-stage cervical cancer: trachelectomy vs hysterectomy.,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol.,2018-08-21,"Trachelectomy is the treatment of choice for reproductive-aged women with early-stage cervical cancer who desire future fertility. Comprehensive population-based statistics have been missing to date. We sought to compare characteristics and survival of reproductive-aged women who underwent trachelectomy for early-stage cervical cancer to those who had hysterectomy. This is a retrospective observational study examining the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program from 1998 through 2014. Women <45 years of age with stage IA and IB1 (tumor size ≤2 cm) cervical cancer who underwent trachelectomy were compared to those who underwent hysterectomy. Multivariable models were used to identify clinicopathological factors associated with trachelectomy. Survival was compared between the 2 groups after propensity score matching. Among 6359 women, 190 (3.0%; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-3.4) underwent trachelectomy. The median age of the trachelectomy group was 31 years (interquartile range, 28-34). The proportion of women who underwent trachelectomy significantly increased during the study period (1.2% in 1998 through 2002, 3.0% in 2003 through 2008, and 4.5% in 2009 through 2014, P < .001). Younger age, nonblack race, single marital status, eastern registry area, recent disease diagnosis, nonsquamous histology, and higher stage were independent factors associated with trachelectomy use (all, adjusted P < .05). After propensity score matching, 5-year cause-specific survival (96.9% vs 96.6%; hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-2.30; P = .59) and overall survival (96.1% vs 96.6%; hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-2.20; P = .61) were similar between the trachelectomy group and the hysterectomy group.

Survival in Differentiated Thyroid Cancer: Comparing the AJCC Cancer Staging Seventh and Eighth Editions.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2018-10-01,"The American Joint Committee on Cancer Cancer Staging System for differentiated thyroid cancer has been recently revised. The purpose of this study was to compare survival prognostication between the seventh and eighth editions. We retrospectively reviewed 2579 differentiated thyroid cancer patients who underwent surgery at MD Anderson Cancer Center between 2000 and 2015. Disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log rank test. The effect of potential predictor was estimated using Cox proportional hazards model. Power of survival prediction was estimated using Harrell's C concordance index (C-index), and predictive capacities for DSS were estimated using proportion of variance explained (PVE). Revision of tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) categories, age cutoff, and stage reassignment in the 8<sup>th</sup> edition caused reclassification of overall stage compared with the seventh edition. The proportion of patients in stage I and II increased from 62% to 83% and 5% to 12%, respectively, while the proportion of patients in stage III and IV decreased from 20% to 2% and 14% to 3%, respectively. Ten-year DSS for stages I-IV based on the seventh edition were 100%, 97.5%, 98.3%, and 82.6%, respectively, while 10-year DSS for the corresponding stage in the eighth edition were 99.8%, 88.3%, 72.4%, and 71.9%, respectively. In multivariate analysis for both seventh edition (C-index 0.94, PVE 4.6%) and eighth edition (C-index 0.94, PVE 4.8%), the factors predictive of worse outcome for DSS were older age, advanced tumor size category, and distant metastasis while cervical lymph node metastases did not predict worse survival. For the eighth edition, patients <55 years of age with stage II disease had significantly worse DSS (p < 0.001) than patients ≥55 years with stage II disease but appeared to be similar to patients ≥55 years with stage III (p = 0.742) and IV disease (p = 0.566). Patients ≥55 years old with T3a and T3b disease had 10-year DSS of 67% and 92%, respectively (p = 0.390). The AJCC eighth edition is similar to the seventh edition in disease-specific survival prediction. Potential modifications that may improve disease-specific survival prediction in future renditions include reconsideration of T3b tumor category and upstaging classification of patients <55 years of age with distant metastases.",Journal Article,477.0,10.0,The American Joint Committee on Cancer Cancer Staging System for differentiated cancer has been recently revised The purpose of this study was to compare survival prognostication between the seventh and eighth editions We retrospectively reviewed 2579 differentiated cancer patients who underwent surgery at MD Anderson Cancer Center between 2000 and 2015 Disease-specific survival DSS and overall survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log rank test The effect of potential predictor was estimated using Cox proportional hazards model Power of survival prediction was estimated using Harrell 's C concordance index C-index and predictive capacities for DSS were estimated using proportion of variance explained PVE Revision of tumor-node-metastasis TNM categories age cutoff and stage reassignment in the 8 sup th /sup edition caused reclassification of overall stage compared with the seventh edition The proportion of patients in stage I and II increased from 62 to 83 and 5 to 12 respectively while the proportion of patients in stage III and IV decreased from 20 to 2 and 14 to 3 respectively Ten-year DSS for stages I-IV based on the seventh edition were 100 97.5 98.3 and 82.6 respectively while 10-year DSS for the corresponding stage in the eighth edition were 99.8 88.3 72.4 and 71.9 respectively In multivariate analysis for both seventh edition C-index 0.94 PVE 4.6 and eighth edition C-index 0.94 PVE 4.8 the factors predictive of worse outcome for DSS were older age advanced tumor size category and distant metastasis while lymph node metastases did not predict worse survival For the eighth edition patients 55 years of age with stage II disease had significantly worse DSS p 0.001 than patients ≥55 years with stage II disease but appeared to be similar to patients ≥55 years with stage III p 0.742 and IV disease p 0.566 Patients ≥55 years old with T3a and T3b disease had 10-year DSS of 67 and 92 respectively p 0.390 The AJCC eighth edition is similar to the seventh edition in disease-specific survival prediction Potential modifications that may improve disease-specific survival prediction in future renditions include reconsideration of T3b tumor category and upstaging classification of patients 55 years of age with distant metastases,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,"[3, 597, 2093, 2002, 23, 12, 12, 632, 398, 9, 1442, 12, 71, 85, 761, 4218, 3, 743, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 932, 25, 4260, 59, 3, 8114, 2, 7732, 17465, 21, 894, 446, 34150, 1442, 12, 7, 54, 208, 152, 28, 2244, 1929, 12, 574, 59, 1081, 2, 1483, 34, 112, 25, 1788, 2, 63, 25, 11, 661, 75, 3, 876, 882, 596, 2, 72, 75, 1066, 1026, 412, 3, 254, 1, 174, 980, 10, 661, 75, 418, 831, 1017, 202, 2349, 1, 25, 1590, 10, 661, 75, 11214, 292, 256, 1827, 558, 256, 558, 2, 464, 14866, 9, 1788, 11, 661, 75, 920, 1, 4446, 3672, 5726, 5646, 1, 30, 289, 278, 2918, 1996, 89, 2779, 2, 82, 51212, 4, 3, 66, 172, 4517, 172, 3580, 1546, 10101, 1, 63, 82, 72, 5, 3, 8114, 3580, 3, 920, 1, 7, 4, 82, 70, 2, 215, 101, 29, 744, 6, 852, 2, 33, 6, 133, 106, 369, 3, 920, 1, 7, 4, 82, 316, 2, 478, 340, 29, 179, 6, 18, 2, 213, 6, 27, 106, 1618, 111, 1788, 9, 1153, 70, 478, 90, 23, 3, 8114, 3580, 11, 394, 1015, 33, 1096, 27, 2, 878, 49, 106, 369, 79, 111, 1788, 9, 3, 1734, 82, 4, 3, 7732, 3580, 11, 1058, 66, 889, 27, 720, 39, 2, 792, 83, 106, 4, 331, 65, 9, 110, 8114, 3580, 256, 558, 13, 960, 5726, 39, 49, 2, 7732, 3580, 256, 558, 13, 960, 5726, 39, 66, 3, 130, 464, 1, 639, 228, 9, 1788, 11, 434, 89, 131, 30, 444, 2169, 2, 626, 278, 369, 263, 289, 196, 205, 44, 678, 639, 25, 9, 3, 7732, 3580, 7, 614, 60, 1, 89, 5, 82, 215, 34, 42, 97, 639, 1788, 19, 13, 144, 76, 7, 15425, 60, 5, 82, 215, 34, 84, 2121, 6, 40, 288, 6, 7, 15425, 60, 5, 82, 316, 19, 13, 12585, 2, 478, 34, 19, 13, 14539, 7, 15425, 60, 1095, 5, 12844, 2, 14499, 34, 42, 79, 111, 1788, 1, 598, 2, 937, 106, 19, 13, 7992, 3, 2271, 7732, 3580, 16, 288, 6, 3, 8114, 3580, 4, 34, 112, 25, 1590, 174, 2916, 17, 68, 401, 34, 112, 25, 1590, 4, 508, 73464, 643, 23110, 1, 14499, 30, 2169, 2, 6335, 947, 1, 7, 614, 60, 1, 89, 5, 626, 196]",2294.0,30141373,147
Locally advanced cervical cancer: A study of 5-year outcomes.,Indian journal of cancer,Indian J Cancer,,"Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among Indian women. This present retrospective study was conducted to report patient outcomes with locally advanced cervical cancer treated in the year 2010. Case records of cervical cancer patients registered from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2010 were retrieved. A total of 1200 patients were registered, of which 583 received either definitive or adjuvant radiotherapy (RT). Of these, 345 patients who received complete treatment at our hospital were included for outcome analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient- and treatment-related variables, and Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed for survival analysis. The median age was 56 years (range: 33-90). Squamous carcinoma was the most common histology (91.4%) and the majority were FIGO Stage III (45.4%). Median follow-up of the cohort was 44 months (1-85 months). The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) across stages was 50%.

Acute hematological toxicity during post-operative bowel sparing image-guided intensity modulated radiation with concurrent cisplatin.,The British journal of radiology,Br J Radiol,2018-10-03,"To report acute hematological toxicity (HT) in patients receiving post-operative bowel sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and cisplatin and its dosimetric predictors. Clinical database of Phase III trial (NCT01279135), that randomized patients to post-operative conformal or intensity modulated radiation therapy, was searched to select patient strata that received bowel sparing IMRT (50 Gy/25#/5 wks) and concurrent cisplatin (40 mg m<sup>-</sup><sup>2</sup>). Pelvic bone marrow (BM) was retrospectively delineated in two sets: whole bone (WB), and freehand (FH) inner cavity of bone. Dose volume histograms (DVH) of BM were obtained. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve identified DVH thresholds that predicted for Grade≥ II HT with highest specificity. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed. Overall 75 patients received concurrent cisplatin. Grades I-V HT was observed in 38.7%, 42.7%, 14.7%, 0%, and 0% patients, respectively. Grade ≥ II leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia were observed in 26%, 40%, 26.5%, and 1.4% respectively. None of the HT resulted in treatment break. On univariate analysis, whole pelvis+ lumbar FH V30 >55% & V40>35%, whole pelvis WB and FH V40 > 35%, and lower pelvis WB and FH V40 >20% correlated for Grade ≥ II leucopenia and neutropenia. None of the BM dose volume constraints predicted for overall HT or neutropenia on multivariate analysis. The IMRT arm of NCT01279135 (PARCER study) that employed strict bowel constraints had unintentional but desirable BM sparing. None of the BM subvolume DVH parameters could be validated on multivariate analysis. The prospective study reports feasibility of bone marrow sparing with bowel sparing post-operative pelvic IMRT and concurrent chemotherapy for cervical cancer. The present study reports low incidence of hematological and gastrointestinal toxicity during post-operative chemoradiation with IMRT. As both whole bone and freehand pelvis BM contours predicted for HT, hence an easier method of whole bone contouring should continue to be used till further validation of more specific BM subvolumes becomes available. The study results highlight the need for further research into dose volume constraints during post-operative IMRT.","Clinical Trial, Phase III",475.0,1.0,To report acute hematological toxicity HT in patients receiving post-operative bowel sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy IMRT and cisplatin and its dosimetric predictors Clinical database of Phase III trial NCT01279135 that randomized patients to post-operative conformal or intensity modulated radiation therapy was searched to select patient strata that received bowel sparing IMRT 50 Gy/25 /5 wks and concurrent cisplatin 40 mg m sup /sup sup 2 /sup Pelvic marrow BM was retrospectively delineated in two sets whole WB and freehand FH inner cavity of Dose volume histograms DVH of BM were obtained Receiver operating characteristic ROC curve identified DVH thresholds that predicted for Grade≥ II HT with highest specificity Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed Overall 75 patients received concurrent cisplatin Grades I-V HT was observed in 38.7 42.7 14.7 0 and 0 patients respectively Grade ≥ II leukopenia neutropenia anemia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 26 40 26.5 and 1.4 respectively None of the HT resulted in treatment break On univariate analysis whole pelvis+ lumbar FH V30 55 V40 35 whole pelvis WB and FH V40 35 and lower pelvis WB and FH V40 20 correlated for Grade ≥ II leucopenia and neutropenia None of the BM dose volume constraints predicted for overall HT or neutropenia on multivariate analysis The IMRT arm of NCT01279135 PARCER study that employed strict bowel constraints had unintentional but desirable BM sparing None of the BM subvolume DVH parameters could be validated on multivariate analysis The prospective study reports feasibility of marrow sparing with bowel sparing post-operative pelvic IMRT and concurrent chemotherapy for cancer The present study reports low incidence of hematological and toxicity during post-operative chemoradiation with IMRT As both whole and freehand pelvis BM contours predicted for HT hence an easier method of whole contouring should continue to be used till further validation of more specific BM subvolumes becomes available The study results highlight the need for further research into dose volume constraints during post-operative IMRT,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[6, 414, 286, 2890, 155, 3152, 4, 7, 357, 539, 1208, 1659, 1851, 837, 1757, 310, 964, 2, 540, 2, 211, 3187, 674, 38, 609, 1, 124, 316, 160, 51220, 17, 384, 7, 6, 539, 1208, 2972, 15, 837, 1757, 121, 36, 10, 3080, 6, 1717, 69, 5758, 17, 103, 1659, 1851, 964, 212, 381, 243, 33, 16820, 2, 750, 540, 327, 81, 188, 172, 172, 172, 18, 172, 1110, 581, 1246, 10, 894, 5610, 4, 100, 2270, 902, 7126, 2, 36307, 5348, 7938, 2405, 1, 61, 433, 8638, 8255, 1, 1246, 11, 683, 3185, 2584, 2037, 3783, 1496, 108, 8255, 4634, 17, 783, 9, 73506, 215, 3152, 5, 1076, 1121, 880, 2, 331, 65, 10, 173, 63, 481, 7, 103, 750, 540, 2276, 70, 603, 3152, 10, 164, 4, 519, 67, 595, 67, 213, 67, 13, 2, 13, 7, 106, 88, 749, 215, 3904, 778, 1545, 2, 1340, 11, 164, 4, 432, 327, 432, 33, 2, 14, 39, 106, 1292, 1, 3, 3152, 627, 4, 24, 4338, 23, 880, 65, 902, 3270, 6187, 5348, 14613, 614, 12454, 465, 902, 3270, 7126, 2, 5348, 12454, 465, 2, 280, 3270, 7126, 2, 5348, 12454, 179, 438, 9, 88, 749, 215, 10317, 2, 778, 1292, 1, 3, 1246, 61, 433, 4879, 783, 9, 63, 3152, 15, 778, 23, 331, 65, 3, 964, 475, 1, 51220, 73507, 45, 17, 2516, 8043, 1659, 4879, 42, 17350, 84, 7365, 1246, 1851, 1292, 1, 3, 1246, 24103, 8255, 1038, 359, 40, 938, 23, 331, 65, 3, 482, 45, 1198, 1437, 1, 581, 1851, 5, 1659, 1851, 539, 1208, 1110, 964, 2, 750, 56, 9, 12, 3, 364, 45, 1198, 154, 287, 1, 2890, 2, 155, 190, 539, 1208, 975, 5, 964, 22, 110, 902, 2, 36307, 3270, 1246, 6137, 783, 9, 3152, 3665, 35, 12734, 596, 1, 902, 7997, 257, 1906, 6, 40, 95, 20528, 195, 929, 1, 80, 112, 1246, 13719, 5366, 390, 3, 45, 99, 1817, 3, 594, 9, 195, 389, 237, 61, 433, 4879, 190, 539, 1208, 964]",2133.0,30179056,794
"Cancer Stem Cells, CD44, and Outcomes Following Chemoradiation in Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer: Results From a Prospective Study.","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2018-09-11,"Although cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been reported across solid tumors, there is a dearth of data regarding CSC and its impact on outcomes of cervical cancer. From October 2013 to December 2015, patients with squamous cancer of the cervix (stage IB2-IVA) were included. Pretreatment and posttreatment biopsy was obtained and immunohistochemistry was performed for SOX-2, OCT-4, Nanog, CD44, and Podoplanin. All patients received concurrent radiation and brachytherapy to an equivalent dose of 80 to 84 Gy to point A with concurrent weekly cisplatin. Correlation of CSC expression was performed with known prognostic factors. The effect of stem cell expression on disease outcomes was tested within multivariate analysis. One hundred fifty patients were included. The median dose to point A was 83 Gy (46-89 Gy) and a median of 4 cycles (range, 0-6 cycles) of chemotherapy was administered. At baseline, moderate to strong immunohistochemical expression of SOX-2, OCT-4, Nanog, CD44, and Podoplanin was observed in 12.8%, 4.8%, 24.4%, 15.5%, and 1.3% of patients, respectively. At median follow-up of 30 months (range, 3-51 months), locoregional and distant relapse was observed in 12.2% and 23.1% of patients, of whom 4.7% had both local and distant relapse. The 3-year disease-free survival rate was 87%. On multivariate analysis, moderate to high CSC expression and CD44 low status (hazard ratio [HR] = 8.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-77.2; P < .04) independently predicted for locoregional relapse-free survival.

Rising Rates of Upfront Surgery in Early Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer: What Factors Predict for This Treatment Paradigm?,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2018-10-01,"In this study, we analyzed patterns of care for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer to identify predictors for upfront surgery compared with definitive chemoradiation (CRT). The National Cancer Database was queried for patients aged 18 years or older with Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics IB2-IIB cervical cancer. All patients underwent either upfront hysterectomy with or without postoperative radiation therapy versus definitive CRT. Logistic regression was used to assess variables associated with modality of treatment (surgery vs CRT). Of the 9494 patients included, 2151 (22.7%) underwent upfront surgery. Of those undergoing surgery, 380 (17.7%) had positive margins, 478 (22.2%) had positive nodes, and 458 (21.3%) had pathologic involvement of the parametrium. Under multiple logistic regression, rates of surgery significantly increased from 2004 (12.2%) to 2012 (31.2%) (odds ratio [OR] per year increase, 1.15; confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.17; P < 0.001). Upfront surgery was more commonly performed in urban (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.03-1.41; P = 0.018) and rural counties (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.24-2.58; P = 0.002), for adenocarcinoma (OR, 2.14; 1.88-2.44; P < 0.001) and adenosquamous (OR, 2.69; 2.11-3.43; P < 0.001) histologies, and in patients from higher median income communities (ORs, 1.19-1.37). Upfront surgery was less common at academic centers (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.58-0.93; P = 0.011). Rates of upfront surgery relative to definitive CRT have increased significantly over the past decade.

Published meta-analyses have provided pooled risk estimates for major cancers caused by SLT, both on global and regional levels. This systematic review was aimed at summarizing the available studies on occurrence and mortality risk of common cancers due to various SLT products. PubMed and Google Scholar databases were systematically searched from 1985 till January 2018 for observational studies on SLT and cancer. The included studies were evaluated and data were extracted and reviewed. The review included 80 studies providing 121 risk estimates for various cancers. Majority of the studies from South-East Asian Region (SEAR) and Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) showed a significant positive association of SLT use with oral [odds ratio (OR) ranging from 1.48 to 27.4] and oesophageal cancers (OR between 2.06 and 12.8), while studies from European Region (EUR) reported a positive association with pancreatic cancer (OR between 1.6 and 2.1). Cancer-related mortality was evaluated in a few reports with higher risk of mortality for lung (OR between 2.0 and 9.1), cervical (OR 2.0) and prostate (OR 2.1) cancers. A wide variation was noted in the association of various cancers and specific SLT products based on their nature, methods of use and inherent toxicity. The majority of chewing tobacco products displayed higher risk for oral and oesophageal cancers while the same was not observed for snus. This review emphasizes on the significantly positive association of SLT use with oral and oesophageal cancers in SEAR and EMR and pancreatic cancer in EUR. Mortality estimates for SLT-associated cancers need further analysis. Risk analysis for cancers of other sites in SLT users also requires multicentric well-designed studies.",Journal Article,569.0,4.0,Causative linkages of smokeless tobacco SLT use with oral potentially malignant disorders and cancers of oral cavity oesophagus and have been reported Published meta-analyses have provided pooled risk estimates for major cancers caused by SLT both on global and regional levels This systematic review was aimed at summarizing the available studies on occurrence and mortality risk of common cancers due to various SLT products PubMed and Google Scholar databases were systematically searched from 1985 till January 2018 for observational studies on SLT and cancer The included studies were evaluated and data were extracted and reviewed The review included 80 studies providing 121 risk estimates for various cancers Majority of the studies from South-East Asian Region SEAR and Eastern Mediterranean Region EMR showed a significant positive association of SLT use with oral odds ratio OR ranging from 1.48 to 27.4 and oesophageal cancers OR between 2.06 and 12.8 while studies from European Region EUR reported a positive association with cancer OR between 1.6 and 2.1 Cancer-related mortality was evaluated in a few reports with higher risk of mortality for OR between 2.0 and 9.1 OR 2.0 and OR 2.1 cancers A wide variation was noted in the association of various cancers and specific SLT products based on their nature methods of use and inherent toxicity The majority of chewing tobacco products displayed higher risk for oral and oesophageal cancers while the same was not observed for snus This review emphasizes on the significantly positive association of SLT use with oral and oesophageal cancers in SEAR and EMR and cancer in EUR Mortality estimates for SLT-associated cancers need further analysis Risk analysis for cancers of other sites in SLT users also requires multicentric well-designed studies,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[8088, 21149, 1, 18412, 2607, 11330, 119, 5, 518, 751, 393, 1997, 2, 163, 1, 518, 2405, 16966, 2, 47, 85, 210, 983, 1742, 318, 47, 1052, 1830, 43, 1423, 9, 458, 163, 1546, 20, 11330, 110, 23, 1648, 2, 951, 148, 26, 1556, 206, 10, 1295, 28, 15693, 3, 390, 94, 23, 2291, 2, 282, 43, 1, 186, 163, 520, 6, 747, 11330, 2766, 3161, 2, 11897, 16945, 2348, 11, 3390, 3080, 29, 4675, 20528, 1024, 2982, 9, 2495, 94, 23, 11330, 2, 12, 3, 159, 94, 11, 194, 2, 74, 11, 2484, 2, 446, 3, 206, 159, 493, 94, 1736, 4141, 43, 1423, 9, 747, 163, 686, 1, 3, 94, 29, 5452, 6633, 2399, 1053, 51266, 2, 2118, 29096, 1053, 7617, 224, 8, 93, 109, 248, 1, 11330, 119, 5, 518, 610, 197, 15, 2223, 29, 14, 576, 6, 428, 39, 2, 8618, 163, 15, 59, 18, 1460, 2, 133, 66, 369, 94, 29, 1865, 1053, 32713, 210, 8, 109, 248, 5, 12, 15, 59, 14, 49, 2, 18, 14, 12, 139, 282, 10, 194, 4, 8, 1021, 1198, 5, 142, 43, 1, 282, 9, 15, 59, 18, 13, 2, 83, 14, 15, 18, 13, 2, 15, 18, 14, 163, 8, 1019, 1380, 10, 1051, 4, 3, 248, 1, 747, 163, 2, 112, 11330, 2766, 90, 23, 136, 2202, 636, 1, 119, 2, 4943, 155, 3, 686, 1, 14244, 2607, 2766, 2507, 142, 43, 9, 518, 2, 8618, 163, 369, 3, 827, 10, 44, 164, 9, 73686, 26, 206, 7519, 23, 3, 97, 109, 248, 1, 11330, 119, 5, 518, 2, 8618, 163, 4, 51266, 2, 7617, 2, 12, 4, 32713, 282, 1423, 9, 11330, 41, 163, 594, 195, 65, 43, 65, 9, 163, 1, 127, 633, 4, 11330, 2735, 120, 1706, 8388, 149, 1114, 94]",1811.0,30264755,52
Gene Expression Analysis Identifies Novel Targets for Cervical Cancer Therapy.,Frontiers in immunology,Front Immunol,2018-09-19,"Although there has been significant progress in prevention and treatment of cervical cancer, this malignancy is still a leading cause of cancer death for women. Anti-angiogenesis and immunotherapy approaches have been providing survival benefits, however, response rates and durability of response need to be improved. There is a clear need for combination therapies that increase effectiveness of these agents and further improve patient outcome. Previous studies have largely focused on gene expression and molecular pathways in untreated cervix cancer. The goal of this study was to evaluate cancer-specific molecular pathways and their correlation with tumor immune profile in recurrent cervical cancer. Tumor and adjacent normal tissues were used to identify potential combination therapy targets. We found that DNA damage repair pathway genes were significantly overexpressed in the tumor. Based on our results and other recent investigations, we suggest that combination immune checkpoint and PARP inhibitor therapy is a high priority consideration for patients with recurrent, previously treated cervical cancer. We also show that multiple epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related genes, including MAP2K4, ID2, JAK1, FGF2, PIK3R1, AKT3, FGF13, and STAT3 may be potential targets. Interestingly, high-throughput analysis of Cancer Genome Atlas data identified distinct targets, including Fatty acid synthase FASN and Matrix Metallopeptidase 1 MMP1 as novel, promising combination therapy partners.",Journal Article,489.0,2.0,Although there has been significant progress in prevention and treatment of cancer this malignancy is still a leading cause of cancer death for women Anti-angiogenesis and immunotherapy approaches have been providing survival benefits however response rates and durability of response need to be improved There is a clear need for combination therapies that increase effectiveness of these agents and further improve patient outcome Previous studies have largely focused on gene expression and molecular pathways in untreated cervix cancer The goal of this study was to evaluate cancer-specific molecular pathways and their correlation with tumor immune profile in recurrent cancer Tumor and adjacent normal tissues were used to identify potential combination therapy targets We found that DNA damage repair pathway genes were significantly overexpressed in the tumor Based on our results and other recent investigations we suggest that combination immune checkpoint and PARP inhibitor therapy is a high priority consideration for patients with recurrent previously treated cancer We also show that multiple epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related genes including MAP2K4 ID2 JAK1 FGF2 PIK3R1 AKT3 FGF13 and STAT3 may be potential targets Interestingly high-throughput analysis of Cancer Genome Atlas data identified distinct targets including Fatty acid synthase FASN and Matrix Metallopeptidase 1 MMP1 as novel promising combination therapy partners,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[242, 125, 71, 85, 93, 1466, 4, 1070, 2, 24, 1, 12, 26, 710, 16, 1234, 8, 1049, 708, 1, 12, 273, 9, 117, 312, 1056, 2, 726, 611, 47, 85, 1736, 25, 1141, 137, 51, 151, 2, 6867, 1, 51, 594, 6, 40, 231, 125, 16, 8, 885, 594, 9, 150, 235, 17, 344, 1236, 1, 46, 183, 2, 195, 401, 69, 228, 698, 94, 47, 1733, 1649, 23, 145, 55, 2, 219, 460, 4, 1278, 3629, 12, 3, 1326, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 376, 12, 112, 219, 460, 2, 136, 816, 5, 30, 250, 800, 4, 387, 12, 30, 2, 2086, 295, 742, 11, 95, 6, 255, 174, 150, 36, 637, 21, 204, 17, 261, 1350, 972, 308, 214, 11, 97, 1711, 4, 3, 30, 90, 23, 114, 99, 2, 127, 435, 2492, 21, 309, 17, 150, 250, 986, 2, 2041, 230, 36, 16, 8, 64, 4690, 2415, 9, 7, 5, 387, 373, 73, 12, 21, 120, 514, 17, 232, 701, 1569, 1970, 139, 214, 141, 26816, 13296, 8075, 18541, 12936, 12429, 73724, 2, 1439, 68, 40, 174, 637, 2873, 64, 3643, 65, 1, 12, 898, 2643, 74, 108, 834, 637, 141, 4038, 971, 3522, 5728, 2, 2248, 31661, 14, 20559, 22, 229, 721, 150, 36, 4005]",1452.0,30283446,442

Cytologic patterns of cervical adenocarcinomas with emphasis on factors associated with underdiagnosis.,Cancer cytopathology,Cancer Cytopathol,2018-10-23,"New cervical cancers continue to be diagnosed despite the success of Papanicolaou (Pap) tests. In an effort to identify pitfalls that limit the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, the authors reviewed the cytologic characteristics of endocervical adenocarcinomas in their patient population. Liquid-based cytology slides from 45 women who had concurrent, histologically confirmed cervical adenocarcinomas were reviewed retrospectively and semiquantitatively for 25 key cytologic traits. The original sign-out diagnosis, available clinical findings, and high-risk human papillomavirus (HR HPV) results also were noted. Abundant tumor cellularity, nuclear size from 3 to 6 times normal, abundant 3-dimensional tumor cell groups, round cell shape, and cytoplasmic neutrophils characterized the 23 cases that were identified correctly as adenocarcinomas. Key reasons for undercalls included low tumor cellularity and low-grade columnar morphology; these also tended to correlate with low-grade or unusual adenocarcinoma variants on histology. Overall, 73% of adenocarcinomas had a concurrent positive HR HPV test. Most endocervical adenocarcinomas can be diagnosed accurately in cases with classical features, but some cases continue to be problematic when evaluated based on cytologic features alone.

Use of Preventive Health Services Among Cancer Survivors in the U.S.,American journal of preventive medicine,Am J Prev Med,2018-10-21,"With improvements in early detection and treatment, a growing proportion of the population now lives with a personal history of a cancer. Although many cancer survivors are in excellent health, the underlying risk factors and side effects of cancer treatment increase the risk of medical complications and secondary malignancies. The 2013 National Health Interview Survey was utilized to assess the association between personal history of cancer and receipt of U.S. Preventive Services Task Force-recommended services, comprising three cancer screening tests (mammography, colonoscopy, and Pap smear) and six general medical preventive care services (aspirin for prevention of cardiovascular disease; blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes screening; diet/activity counseling; and tobacco use counseling). For each preventive service, patients with a history that would preclude that test were excluded. One to three matching of cancer survivors to controls was performed using propensity scores generated from patient-level demographic variables. Conditional logistic regression models were employed to compare odds of screening between matched cohorts of cancer survivors and controls. The years of analysis were 2015 and 2017. A total of 2,639 cancer patients and 31,885 controls were extracted from the merged 2013 National Health Interview Survey.

Minimally Invasive versus Abdominal Radical Hysterectomy for Cervical Cancer.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2018-10-31,"There are limited data from retrospective studies regarding whether survival outcomes after laparoscopic or robot-assisted radical hysterectomy (minimally invasive surgery) are equivalent to those after open abdominal radical hysterectomy (open surgery) among women with early-stage cervical cancer. In this trial involving patients with stage IA1 (lymphovascular invasion), IA2, or IB1 cervical cancer and a histologic subtype of squamous-cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma, we randomly assigned patients to undergo minimally invasive surgery or open surgery. The primary outcome was the rate of disease-free survival at 4.5 years, with noninferiority claimed if the lower boundary of the two-sided 95% confidence interval of the between-group difference (minimally invasive surgery minus open surgery) was greater than -7.2 percentage points (i.e., closer to zero). A total of 319 patients were assigned to minimally invasive surgery and 312 to open surgery. Of the patients who were assigned to and underwent minimally invasive surgery, 84.4% underwent laparoscopy and 15.6% robot-assisted surgery. Overall, the mean age of the patients was 46.0 years. Most patients (91.9%) had stage IB1 disease. The two groups were similar with respect to histologic subtypes, the rate of lymphovascular invasion, rates of parametrial and lymph-node involvement, tumor size, tumor grade, and the rate of use of adjuvant therapy. The rate of disease-free survival at 4.5 years was 86.0% with minimally invasive surgery and 96.5% with open surgery, a difference of -10.6 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], -16.4 to -4.7). Minimally invasive surgery was associated with a lower rate of disease-free survival than open surgery (3-year rate, 91.2% vs. 97.1%; hazard ratio for disease recurrence or death from cervical cancer, 3.74; 95% CI, 1.63 to 8.58), a difference that remained after adjustment for age, body-mass index, stage of disease, lymphovascular invasion, and lymph-node involvement; minimally invasive surgery was also associated with a lower rate of overall survival (3-year rate, 93.8% vs. 99.0%; hazard ratio for death from any cause, 6.00; 95% CI, 1.77 to 20.30). In this trial, minimally invasive radical hysterectomy was associated with lower rates of disease-free survival and overall survival than open abdominal radical hysterectomy among women with early-stage cervical cancer.

Cryotherapy for nodal metastasis in NSCLC with acquired resistance to immunotherapy.,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,J Immunother Cancer,2018-12-12,"Novel approaches with checkpoint inhibitors in immunotherapy continue to be essential in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the low rate of primary response and the development of acquired resistance during the immunotherapy limit their long-term effectiveness. The underlying cause of acquired resistance is poorly understood; potential management strategies for patients with acquired resistance are even less clear. Here, we report the case of a 75-year-old female smoker with cough, fatigue, and weight loss that was found to have an 8.6 cm right upper lobe lung lesion with local invasion, adenopathy, and a malignant pericardial effusion. This lesion was biopsied and identified to be cT3N3M1b squamous cell cancer of the lung without any recognizable PD-L1 expression on tumor cells. For her metastatic NSCLC, the patient underwent two lines of conventional chemotherapy before initiation of combination immunotherapy with an anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibody. Though she initially achieved a response, she thereafter progressed and developed immunotherapy resistant lymph nodal metastasis. While cervical lymph nodes could be surgically removed, another metastasis in an aortocaval area required a more sensitive therapy like thermal ablation. The aortocaval node was partially treated with a single treatment of cryotherapy and demonstrated durable complete response. Cryotherapy for checkpoint immunotherapy resistant metastasis appears to be a safe and feasible treatment for treating metastatic disease in non-small cell lung cancer.

"Relationship between social support, quality of life, and Th2 cytokines in a biobehavioral cancer survivorship trial.",Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,Support Care Cancer,2019-01-05,"Benefits of social support (SS) during cancer survivorship are complex. This study examines change in SS over time in cervical cancer (CXCA) survivors who have completed definitive treatment and how changing SS impacts quality of life (QOL) and T-helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines. We conducted a randomized trial in 204 CXCA survivors to test if psychosocial telephone counseling (PTC) could improve QOL compared to usual care (UC). Although PTC did not target SS, data were collected at baseline, 4 and 9 months post-enrollment using the Medical Outcomes Survey Social Support scale. Biospecimens were collected to investigate associations with patient-reported outcomes. Data were analyzed using multivariate linear models and stepwise regression. Participants' mean age was 43. PTC participants experienced increasing SS compared to UC at 4 months (PTC-UC = 5.1; p = 0.055) and 9 months (PTC-UC = 6.0; p = 0.046). Higher baseline SS and increasing SS were independently associated with improved QOL at 4 and 9 months after adjusting for patient characteristics (p < 0.05). Differences between study arms were not statistically significant. Improvements in QOL at 4 months were observed with increases in emotional/informational and tangible SS.

Trends in Risks for Second Primary Cancers Associated With Index Human Papillomavirus-Associated Cancers.,JAMA network open,JAMA Netw Open,2018-09-07,"In the last 4 decades, survival among patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers has improved, while the incidence of these cancers has increased among younger cohorts. Among survivors of HPV-associated cancers, persistent HPV infection may remain a risk factor for preventable HPV-associated second primary cancers (HPV-SPCs). To investigate the risk of HPV-SPCs among survivors of HPV-associated index cancers and to test the hypothesis that the HPV-SPC risk among these persons has increased over the last 4 decades. A retrospective cohort study of 9 cancer registries of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was conducted to identify patients with HPV-associated (cervical, vaginal, vulvar, oropharyngeal, anal, and penile) cancers diagnosed from January 1, 1973, through December 31, 2014. The dates of analysis were July 1, 2017, to January 31, 2018. The HPV-SPC risk was quantified by calculating standard incidence ratios (SIRs) and excess absolute risks (EARs) per 10 000 person-years at risk (PYR). The HPV-SPC risk by time was estimated using Poisson regression. From 113 272 (73 085 female and 40 187 male) survivors of HPV-associated cancers, 1397 women and 1098 men developed HPV-SPCs. The SIRs for HPV-SPCs were 6.2 (95% CI, 5.9-6.6) among women and 15.8 (95% CI, 14.9-16.8) among men. The EARs were 18.2 per 10 000 PYR for women and 53.5 per 10 000 PYR for men. Among both women and men, those who had index oropharyngeal cancers had the highest HPV-SPC risk (SIR, 19.8 [95% CI, 18.4-21.4] and EAR, 80.6 per 10 000 PYR among women; SIR, 18.0 [95% CI, 16.9-19.1] and EAR, 61.5 per 10 000 PYR among men). Women who had index cervical cancers and men who had index anal cancers had the lowest HPV-SPC risk (SIR, 2.4 [95% CI, 2.2-2.7] and EAR, 4.5 per 10 000 PYR among women; SIR, 6.5 [95% CI, 4.7-8.8] and EAR, 18.5 per 10 000 PYR among men). Both women and men who had index HPV-associated cancers of any kind had a significantly higher risk of oropharyngeal HPV-SPCs. Over the last 4 decades, the risk of developing most types of HPV-SPCs after index cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancers increased. According to this study, the HPV-SPC risk among survivors of HPV-associated cancers is significant, implying that persistent HPV infection at multiple sites may be associated with HPV-SPCs. These findings have the potential to inform surveillance recommendations for survivors of HPV-associated cancers.",Journal Article,501.0,4.0,In the last 4 decades survival among patients with human papillomavirus HPV -associated cancers has improved while the incidence of these cancers has increased among younger cohorts Among survivors of HPV-associated cancers persistent HPV infection may remain a risk factor for preventable HPV-associated second primary cancers HPV-SPCs To investigate the risk of HPV-SPCs among survivors of HPV-associated index cancers and to test the hypothesis that the HPV-SPC risk among these persons has increased over the last 4 decades A retrospective cohort study of 9 cancer registries of the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER database was conducted to identify patients with HPV-associated and cancers diagnosed from January 1 1973 through December 31 2014 The dates of analysis were July 1 2017 to January 31 2018 The HPV-SPC risk was quantified by calculating standard incidence ratios SIRs and excess absolute risks EARs per 10 000 person-years at risk PYR The HPV-SPC risk by time was estimated using Poisson regression From 113 272 73 085 female and 40 187 male survivors of HPV-associated cancers 1397 women and 1098 men developed HPV-SPCs The SIRs for HPV-SPCs were 6.2 95 CI 5.9-6.6 among women and 15.8 95 CI 14.9-16.8 among men The EARs were 18.2 per 10 000 PYR for women and 53.5 per 10 000 PYR for men Among both women and men those who had index cancers had the highest HPV-SPC risk SIR 19.8 95 CI 18.4-21.4 and EAR 80.6 per 10 000 PYR among women SIR 18.0 95 CI 16.9-19.1 and EAR 61.5 per 10 000 PYR among men Women who had index cancers and men who had index cancers had the lowest HPV-SPC risk SIR 2.4 95 CI 2.2-2.7 and EAR 4.5 per 10 000 PYR among women SIR 6.5 95 CI 4.7-8.8 and EAR 18.5 per 10 000 PYR among men Both women and men who had index HPV-associated cancers of any kind had a significantly higher risk of HPV-SPCs Over the last 4 decades the risk of developing most types of HPV-SPCs after index and cancers increased According to this study the HPV-SPC risk among survivors of HPV-associated cancers is significant implying that persistent HPV infection at multiple sites may be associated with HPV-SPCs These findings have the potential to inform surveillance recommendations for survivors of HPV-associated cancers,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[4, 3, 1060, 39, 1968, 25, 107, 7, 5, 171, 3242, 933, 41, 163, 71, 231, 369, 3, 287, 1, 46, 163, 71, 101, 107, 773, 736, 107, 332, 1, 933, 41, 163, 1882, 933, 930, 68, 918, 8, 43, 161, 9, 7936, 933, 41, 419, 86, 163, 933, 25885, 6, 963, 3, 43, 1, 933, 25885, 107, 332, 1, 933, 41, 558, 163, 2, 6, 412, 3, 1492, 17, 3, 933, 13490, 43, 107, 46, 4327, 71, 101, 252, 3, 1060, 39, 1968, 8, 459, 180, 45, 1, 83, 12, 3768, 1, 3, 617, 1284, 2, 396, 99, 1605, 609, 10, 426, 6, 255, 7, 5, 933, 41, 2, 163, 265, 29, 1024, 14, 4756, 298, 1397, 456, 1409, 3, 9561, 1, 65, 11, 2066, 14, 1759, 6, 1024, 456, 2982, 3, 933, 13490, 43, 10, 2790, 20, 8408, 260, 287, 1137, 7120, 2, 2612, 1766, 1098, 19743, 379, 79, 984, 2719, 60, 28, 43, 17475, 3, 933, 13490, 43, 20, 98, 10, 661, 75, 7668, 320, 29, 4259, 6905, 803, 13639, 1061, 2, 327, 5568, 1045, 332, 1, 933, 41, 163, 30993, 117, 2, 39715, 325, 276, 933, 25885, 3, 7120, 9, 933, 25885, 11, 49, 18, 48, 58, 33, 83, 49, 49, 107, 117, 2, 167, 66, 48, 58, 213, 83, 245, 66, 107, 325, 3, 19743, 11, 203, 18, 379, 79, 984, 17475, 9, 117, 2, 699, 33, 379, 79, 984, 17475, 9, 325, 107, 110, 117, 2, 325, 135, 54, 42, 558, 163, 42, 3, 1076, 933, 13490, 43, 3636, 326, 66, 48, 58, 203, 39, 239, 39, 2, 7815, 493, 49, 379, 79, 984, 17475, 107, 117, 3636, 203, 13, 48, 58, 245, 83, 326, 14, 2, 7815, 713, 33, 379, 79, 984, 17475, 107, 325, 117, 54, 42, 558, 163, 2, 325, 54, 42, 558, 163, 42, 3, 2101, 933, 13490, 43, 3636, 18, 39, 48, 58, 18, 18, 18, 67, 2, 7815, 39, 33, 379, 79, 984, 17475, 107, 117, 3636, 49, 33, 48, 58, 39, 67, 66, 66, 2, 7815, 203, 33, 379, 79, 984, 17475, 107, 325, 110, 117, 2, 325, 54, 42, 558, 933, 41, 163, 1, 500, 11968, 42, 8, 97, 142, 43, 1, 933, 25885, 252, 3, 1060, 39, 1968, 3, 43, 1, 931, 96, 630, 1, 933, 25885, 50, 558, 2, 163, 101, 768, 6, 26, 45, 3, 933, 13490, 43, 107, 332, 1, 933, 41, 163, 16, 93, 7885, 17, 1882, 933, 930, 28, 232, 633, 68, 40, 41, 5, 933, 25885, 46, 272, 47, 3, 174, 6, 2295, 617, 883, 9, 332, 1, 933, 41, 163]",2254.0,30646145,840
Data-Derived Treatment Duration Goal for Cervical Cancer: Should 8 Weeks Remain the Target in the Era of Concurrent Chemoradiation?,JCO clinical cancer informatics,JCO Clin Cancer Inform,2017-11-01,"Prior studies have demonstrated the importance of treatment duration (TD) in radiation therapy (RT) for cervical cancer, with an 8-week goal based primarily on RT alone. This study uses a contemporary cohort to estimate the time point by which completion of chemoradiation therapy is most critical. The National Cancer Database was queried for women with nonmetastatic cervical cancer diagnosed from 2004 to 2012 who underwent chemotherapy, external beam RT, and brachytherapy. Data-derived TD cut points for overall survival (OS) were computed by using recursive partitioning analysis with bootstrapped aggregation (bagging) and 10-fold cross-validation. Models were independently trained with 70% of the population and validated on 30% of the population by log-rank test with and without propensity matching. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was performed for the entire cohort. In all, 7,355 women were identified with a median TD of 57 days. Bagged recursive partitioning analysis converged to a mean cut point of 66.6 days (median, 64.5 days; interquartile range, 63.5 to 68.5 days). Cross-validation yielded a cut point of 63.3 days. Both cut points differentiated OS in validation. Younger age, recent diagnosis, geographic region, nongovernment insurance, shorter distance to treatment facility, metropolitan location, lower comorbidity, squamous cell carcinoma, lower stage, negative lymph nodes, and shorter TD were independently associated with longer OS. With adjustment, TD within the mean cut point (64.9 days; hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.87) and 56 days (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.95) were associated with longer OS.

Conization pathologic features as a predictor of intermediate and high risk features on radical hysterectomy specimens in early stage cervical cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol.

Our objective was to evaluate the additive value of pathologic features of a cone biopsy toward identifying patients with high risk tumors for which adjuvant therapy may be indicated. Patients with early stage cervical cancer undergoing a conization followed by radical hysterectomy from 1995 to 2016 were retrospectively identified. Clinical and pathologic data were abstracted from patient medical records. A total of 115 patients were identified. Based on final pathology, 70.5% were low risk, 10.4% intermediate risk, and 19.1% were high risk. The additive pathologic features of the conization specimen would have reclassified five patients from low into the intermediate risk group. Though depth of invasion did not correlate with final pathology results, when lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) was present in the conization specimen, 51.2% of patients were noted to meet intermediate/high risk; compared to only 9.5% without LVSI. In women with early stage cervical cancer, additive pathology of the conization and hysterectomy specimen did not significantly impact risk stratification, only affecting 4.3% of patients. However, presence of LVSI in the conization was associated with intermediate risk criteria in 60% of cases and high risk criteria in 37% of cases.

A Study of Pap Smears in HIV-Positive and HIV-Negative Women from a Tertiary Care Center in South India.,Acta cytologica,Acta Cytol.,2019-02-05,"The aim of this work was to study the spectrum of epithelial abnormalities on Pap smears of HIV-positive women categorized as per the Bethesda System of Reporting Cervical Cytology, to correlate them with CD4 lymphocyte counts, and to compare them with the spectrum of abnormalities seen in a HIV-negative control group. Study Design and Methodology: The present study was a 6-year retrospective study conducted in the Department of Pathology at Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore, which included 150 Pap smears from HIV-positive and HIV-negative women, respectively. The Pap-stained slides of the cases were retrieved and studied. The data collected were tabulated and analyzed. A statistical study was performed using SPSS software. The χ2 test was used to analyze the data and a p value < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Pap smear abnormalities were twice as high in HIV-infected women (12%) as compared with HIV-negative women (6%; p = 0.006, RR = 2). Negative for intraepithelial lesion/malignancy was the most common finding (88%), which was further subdivided into inflammatory, atrophic smear, non-specific, candidiasis, and bacterial vaginitis groups. The percentage of epithelial abnormalities was 12%, including: atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, 5.55%; atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude HSIL, 16.66%; low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, 5.55%; high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), 61.11%, and squamous cell carcinoma, 11.11%. The highest incidence of intraepithelial lesions in HIV-positive females was in the age group of 34-49 years.

A mobile-phone based high-resolution microendoscope to image cervical precancer.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2019-02-06,"Nearly 90% of cervical cancer cases and deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries that lack comprehensive national HPV immunization and cervical cancer screening programs. In these settings, it is difficult to implement screening programs due to a lack of infrastructure and shortage of trained personnel. Screening programs based on visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) have been successfully implemented in some low-resource settings. However, VIA has poor specificity and up to 90% of patients receiving treatment based on a positive VIA exam are over-treated. A number of studies have suggested that high-resolution cervical imaging to visualize nuclear morphology in vivo can improve specificity by better distinguishing precancerous and benign lesions. To enable high-resolution imaging in low-resource settings, we developed a portable, low-cost, high-resolution microendoscope that uses a mobile phone to detect and display images of cervical epithelium in vivo with subcellular resolution. The device was fabricated for less than $2,000 using commercially available optical components including filters, an LED and triplet lenses assembled in a 3D-printed opto-mechanical mount. We show that the mobile high-resolution microendoscope achieves similar resolution and signal-to-background ratio as previously reported high-resolution microendoscope systems using traditional cameras and computers to detect and display images.

Cervical cancer screening in rural India: Status & current concepts.,The Indian journal of medical research,Indian J. Med.

The situation is more alarming in the rural areas where the majority of women are illiterate and ignorant about the hazards of cervical cancer. Different screening strategies such as rural cancer registries and camp approach for cancer detection have been found useful in minimizing the problem of cervical cancer in the villages. Various screening techniques such as visual inspection with acetic acid, visual inspection with Lugol's iodine, visual inspection with magnification devices-magnavisualizer, Pap smear and HPV-DNA testing have been suggested and tried under low-resource settings of our country, and cervical cytology screening has been found effective in reducing incidence of the disease. In the present review, feasibility of different screening methods has been assessed to find out the most suitable mode applicable at the rural level.

This is a retrospective review from 1990 to 2017 of subjects with incidental cervical cancer. Baseline demographics, preoperative evaluations, surgical data, and histopathologic characteristics were recorded. Deviations from screening guidelines or false-negative screenings were identified. Associations of independent risk factors according to age, insurance status, and histology were assessed. Fifty-nine subjects with a median age of 43 years were found. Abnormal uterine bleeding was the most common indication for hysterectomy (61%, n = 36) and cervical dysplasia was present in 42% (n = 25) of these cases. Of those with inappropriate screening, 38% (n = 17) did not have documented Pap test, 22% (n = 10) had Pap that was not triaged appropriately, 18% (n = 8) received Pap and colposcopy but no indicated excisional procedure, and 22% (n = 10) had an excisional procedure that was not managed according to guidelines. False-negative screening occurred in 25% subjects (n = 15). There was no significant association between age, insurance status, or histology and risk of false-negative screening or inadequate screening. The most common cause of incidental cervical cancer at the time of simple hysterectomy was failure to properly adhere to screening guidelines. Less frequently, false-negative screening was the cause.

Prevalence of high-grade anal dysplasia among women with high-grade lower genital tract dysplasia or cancer: Results of a pilot study.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2019-03-01,"To estimate the prevalence of high-grade anal dysplasia in women with high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma of the cervix, vagina or vulva. In this cross-sectional study, participants underwent anal cytology, anal HPV testing with Cervista HPV16/18 and high-resolution anoscopy (HRA). Patients with HSIL (high-grade squamous cell intraepithelial lesion) or greater on anal cytology or anal biopsy were referred to a colorectal surgery specialist for further evaluation. Seventy-five women were enrolled in the study, including 47 with cervical (cervix group), 10 with vaginal (vagina group), 15 with vulvar (vulva group), 1 with cervical and vaginal, and 2 with vulvar and vaginal disease. The median age in the cervix group (40 years (range 26-69)) was substantially younger than in the vagina (60 years (38-69)) and the vulva (59 years (36-75)) groups. Anal HSIL based on composite endpoints of the most severe cytology or histology result was diagnosed in 6 patients (8.0%). Anal cytology revealed HSIL in 2 (2.7%), atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) in 12 (16.0%), low-grade squamous cell intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) in 2 (2.7%), and was normal in 59 (78.7%) patients. Anal HPV16/18 test was positive in 15 (20.0%), negative in 48 (64.0%) and insufficient in 12 (16.0%) patients. Of the 6 women with high-grade anal dysplasia, three (50%) had a positive anal HPV16/18 test. No case of anal cancer was observed.

A comparative analysis of quality of life after postoperative intensity-modulated radiotherapy or three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for cervical cancer.,Indian journal of cancer,Indian J Cancer,,"The aim of this study is to compare the quality of life (QOL) between adjuvant three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for cervical cancer. QOL assessment was done at the baseline and then longitudinally after completing (chemo) radiation. All patients completed EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ Cx-24 modules. Independent-sample t-test was used to compare the mean scores between the two groups. Analysis of variance was used to compare differences in QOL measures over the six time points (baseline, post-RT, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after treatment) and between treatment groups (3DCRT vs. IMRT). Linear mixed model was also performed to account for attrition. Overall, 64 patients (image-guided IMRT, n = 40 and 3DCRT, n = 24) completed QOL assessment. The median age and follow-up period were 48 years and 15.5 months, respectively. General QOL domains such as emotional (at 12 months, P = 0.04) and social (at 3 months, P = 0.02 and 12 months, P = 0.03) were better with IMRT.

Am.,2019-02-02,"Laparoscopic and thoracoscopic or robotic-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy offers benefits in decreased postoperative complications and faster recovery. The choice of operation depends on patient and surgeon factors. McKeown or 3-field esophagectomy requires dissection in the abdomen, chest, and neck, with a cervical anastomosis.

We conducted a case-control study and searched Texas Medicaid databases between 2008 and 2012 for eligible cancer patients. A comparison group was selected for each cancer site using a 2-step 1:1 propensity score matching method. Patients were followed for 2 years after cancer diagnosis to estimate monthly and yearly direct medical costs. For each cancer site, the differential cost between patients and the matched comparison individuals was the estimated cost associated with cancer. The study included 583 cervical, 62 vaginal, and 137 vulvar cancer patients and equal numbers of cancer-free comparison individuals. Among the cases, 322 cervical cancer patients, 46 vaginal cancer patients, and 102 vulvar cancer patients were Medicaid-Medicare dual eligible enrollees.

The Extent of Neck Dissection Among Patients Who Receive Adjuvant Radiotherapy for HNSCC and Its Effect on Disease-Specific and Overall Survival.,"Ear, nose, & throat journal",Ear Nose Throat J,2019-04-04,"The study objective was to assess if the extent of neck dissection among patients who receive adjuvant radiotherapy affects regional recurrence and survival. This was a retrospective study of patients who had clinical metastatic mucosal primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) to cervical lymph nodes done at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, New York from 2004 to 2015. Patients with previous radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy were excluded. All patients had surgery to the primary tumor and the neck followed by adjuvant (chemo) radiation. Patients have been divided into 2 groups according to type of neck dissection as either selective neck dissection (SND) or comprehensive neck dissection (CND). The extent of neck dissection was determined by surgeon preference. All patients received postoperative radiotherapy to the primary tumor bed and to the neck with or without chemotherapy. Main outcomes were measured in regional recurrence and overall survival. In our study, 74 patients were included. Among the 2 groups of patients, 3-year outcomes for regional recurrence occurred in 4 (7.1%) of 56 patients in the SND group and 2 (11.1%) of 18 patients in the CND group.

Molecular mechanisms in progression of HPV-associated cervical carcinogenesis.,Journal of biomedical science,J. Biomed. Sci.,2019-04-23,"Cervical cancer is the fourth most frequent cancer in women worldwide and a major cause of mortality in developing countries. Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is a necessary cause for the development of cervical cancer. In addition, genetic and epigenetic alterations in host cell genes are crucial for progression of cervical precancerous lesions to invasive cancer. Although much progress has been made in understanding the life cycle of HPV and it's role in the development of cervical cancer, there is still a critical need for accurate surveillance strategies and targeted therapeutic options to eradicate these cancers in patients. Given the widespread nature of HPV infection and the type specificity of currently available HPV vaccines, it is crucial that molecular details of the natural history of HPV infection as well as the biological activities of viral oncoproteins be elucidated. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in oncogenesis can provide novel insights and opportunities for designing effective therapeutic approaches against HPV-associated malignancies.

Expanded validation of the EPIC bowel and urinary domains for use in women with gynecologic cancer undergoing postoperative radiotherapy.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2019-05-16,"Women with endometrial or cervical cancer at risk for recurrence receive postoperative radiation therapy (RT). A patient reported outcomes (PRO) instrument to assess bowel and urinary toxicities is the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC), which has been validated in men with prostate cancer. As this instrument specifically measures bowel toxicity and the degree to which this is a problem, it was used in NRG Oncology/RTOG 1203 to compare intensity modulated RT (IMRT) to standard RT. This paper reports on the expanded validation of EPIC for use in women receiving pelvic RT. In addition to the EPIC bowel domain, urinary toxicity (EPIC urinary domain), patient reported bowel toxicities (PRO-CTCAE) and quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)) were completed before, during and after treatment. Sensitivity, reliability and concurrent validity were assessed. Mean bowel and urinary scores among 278 women enrolled were significantly worse during treatment and differed between groups. Acceptable to good reliability for bowel and urinary domain scores were obtained at all time points with the exception of one at baseline. Correlations between function and bother scores within the bowel and urinary domains were consistently stronger than those across domains.

Oncol.,2019-05-20,"Improved treatment for advanced cervical cancer is needed; currently, treatment options include combined chemotherapy and bevacizumab or pembrolizumab monotherapy for PD-L1 positive disease. PIK3CA and KRAS mutations have been reported in cervical cancers; this study therefore tested dual inhibition of PI3K and RAS signaling by combining the MEK inhibitor trametinib and the AKT inhibitor GSK2141795 in recurrent cervical cancer. This was an investigator-initiated phase II study combining trametinib and GSK2141795 in patients with recurrent cervical cancer. Primary endpoint was best tumor response; secondary endpoints included progression free survival, overall survival, and safety assessment. Translational objectives included characterization of molecular alterations in PI3K and RAS signaling pathway genes. Planned accrual was 35 patients; 14 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of study drug before the study was terminated due to discontinuation of GSK2141795 development. There were no confirmed responses; 1 patient had an unconfirmed PR, 8 had stable disease, 3 had progression as best response, and 2 were unevaluable. Toxicities were mostly grade 1 and 2, although 57% of patients experienced grade 3/4 adverse events and 50% patients required a dose reduction. The combination of trametinib and GSK2141795 was feasible but required dose holds and modifications for adverse events; however, anti-cancer activity was minimal, even in patients with PI3K or RAS pathway alterations. Although the study was terminated early after GSK2141795 development was halted, the findings in these 14 patients do not support further development of this combination in cervical cancer.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",246.0,0.0,Improved treatment for advanced cancer is needed currently treatment options include combined chemotherapy and bevacizumab or pembrolizumab monotherapy for PD-L1 positive disease PIK3CA and KRAS mutations have been reported in cancers this study therefore tested dual inhibition of PI3K and RAS signaling by combining the MEK inhibitor trametinib and the AKT inhibitor GSK2141795 in recurrent cancer This was an investigator-initiated phase II study combining trametinib and GSK2141795 in patients with recurrent cancer Primary endpoint was best tumor response secondary endpoints included progression free survival overall survival and safety assessment Translational objectives included characterization of molecular alterations in PI3K and RAS signaling pathway genes Planned accrual was 35 patients 14 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of study drug before the study was terminated due to discontinuation of GSK2141795 development There were no confirmed responses 1 patient had an unconfirmed PR 8 had stable disease 3 had progression as best response and 2 were unevaluable Toxicities were mostly grade 1 and 2 although 57 of patients experienced grade 3/4 adverse events and 50 patients required a dose reduction The combination of trametinib and GSK2141795 was feasible but required dose holds and modifications for adverse events however anti-cancer activity was minimal even in patients with PI3K or RAS pathway alterations Although the study was terminated early after GSK2141795 development was halted the findings in these 14 patients do not support further development of this combination in cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[231, 24, 9, 131, 12, 16, 575, 694, 24, 838, 643, 397, 56, 2, 599, 15, 2233, 1411, 9, 333, 729, 109, 34, 1506, 2, 723, 138, 47, 85, 210, 4, 163, 26, 45, 673, 650, 1828, 297, 1, 974, 2, 1102, 314, 20, 1525, 3, 1693, 230, 3858, 2, 3, 649, 230, 18719, 4, 387, 12, 26, 10, 35, 3464, 1917, 124, 215, 45, 1525, 3858, 2, 18719, 4, 7, 5, 387, 12, 86, 1138, 10, 824, 30, 51, 568, 1387, 159, 91, 115, 25, 63, 25, 2, 367, 455, 2460, 2409, 159, 2136, 1, 219, 593, 4, 974, 2, 1102, 314, 308, 214, 1465, 2262, 10, 465, 7, 213, 7, 11, 346, 2, 103, 28, 506, 104, 61, 1, 45, 234, 348, 3, 45, 10, 5640, 520, 6, 2007, 1, 18719, 193, 125, 11, 77, 557, 253, 14, 69, 42, 35, 5971, 998, 66, 42, 585, 34, 27, 42, 91, 22, 824, 51, 2, 18, 11, 18257, 385, 11, 2754, 88, 14, 2, 18, 242, 696, 1, 7, 592, 88, 27, 39, 290, 281, 2, 212, 7, 616, 8, 61, 628, 3, 150, 1, 3858, 2, 18719, 10, 1313, 84, 616, 61, 5253, 2, 2916, 9, 290, 281, 137, 312, 12, 128, 10, 1048, 871, 4, 7, 5, 974, 15, 1102, 308, 593, 242, 3, 45, 10, 5640, 191, 50, 18719, 193, 10, 9473, 3, 272, 4, 46, 213, 7, 1022, 44, 538, 195, 193, 1, 26, 150, 4, 12]",1632.0,31118140,638
Development and Implementation of a Simulation-Based Educational Workshop on Gynecological Brachytherapy: Pilot Study at a National Meeting.,Practical radiation oncology,Pract Radiat Oncol,2019-05-22,"Despite the importance of brachytherapy in the curative treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer, reviews of practice patterns in the United States have identified a decline in brachytherapy use in clinically appropriate patient populations. A survey of radiation oncologists identified lack of time and lack of guidance as barriers. To address these barriers, the purpose of this study was to develop a simulation-based educational (SBE) gynecologic brachytherapy workshop. The SBE gynecologic brachytherapy workshop was developed with expertise from 2 institutions, combining procedural simulation with a practical discussion of brachytherapy applicator insertion techniques. The primary outcome was feasibility of workshop deployment, defined as completion of all workshop components in the time allotted. Preworkshop and postworkshop surveys were also administered to assess efficacy, a secondary outcome. The workshop took place at a national radiation oncology meeting, and all workshop components were completed in the 2 hours allotted. SBE stations focused on (1) fiducial placement, (2-3) applicator selection, (4) suturing, and (5) pelvic examination and applicator placement. Fourteen participants completed surveys. Respondents included residents and attending physicians. More than 50% of respondents were from academic practices and practiced gynecologic brachytherapy weekly or more. Curricular objectives for this workshop were for ≥20% trainees to report increased confidence in practice and ≥20% of trainees to report increased familiarity with applicators. After participation in the workshop, confidence in applicator choice improved in 9 of 13 participants (69%), confidence in complication management improved in 8 of 13 participants (62%), and familiarity with applicators improved in 7 of 13 participants (54%). These differences were statistically significant at α = .05. This study demonstrated feasibility in using simulation for gynecologic brachytherapy education at a national meeting. Although most respondents were experienced in brachytherapy, more than half reported increased confidence and familiarity with aspects of the procedure after the workshop.

We report a patient presenting with progressive spastic quadriparesis resulting from compressive myelopathy due to intradural degenerative cyst at the CV junction. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging showed the intradural cyst at the cervicomedullary junction with degenerative changes causing myelopathy. We performed decompression of the CV junction, and histopathology of the cyst revealed degenerative cyst. Postoperatively the symptoms were relieved with no apparent complication. Intraspinal degenerative cysts causing compressive myelopathy are rare. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of intradural degenerative cyst at the CV junction.

"Low-cost, high-resolution imaging for detecting cervical precancer in medically-underserved areas of Texas.",Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2019-07-06,"Cervical cancer rates in the United States have declined since the 1940's, however, cervical cancer incidence remains elevated in medically-underserved areas, especially in the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) along the Texas-Mexico border. High-resolution microendoscopy (HRME) is a low-cost, in vivo imaging technique that can identify high-grade precancerous cervical lesions (CIN2+) at the point-of-care. The goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of HRME in medically-underserved areas in Texas, comparing results to a tertiary academic medical center. HRME was evaluated in five different outpatient clinical settings, two in Houston and three in the RGV, with medical providers of varying skill and training. Colposcopy, followed by HRME imaging, was performed on eligible women. The sensitivity and specificity of traditional colposcopy and colposcopy followed by HRME to detect CIN2+ were compared and HRME image quality was evaluated. 174 women (227 cervical sites) were included in the final analysis, with 12% (11% of cervical sites) diagnosed with CIN2+ on histopathology. On a per-site basis, a colposcopic impression of low-grade precancer or greater had a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 45% to detect CIN2+. While there was no significant difference in sensitivity (76%, p = 0.62), the specificity when using HRME was significantly higher than that of traditional colposcopy (56%, p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in HRME image quality between clinical sites (p = 0.77) or medical providers (p = 0.33).

Sentinel lymph node biopsy with cervical injection of indocyanine green in apparent early-stage endometrial cancer: predictors of unsuccessful mapping.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2019-08-08,"To identify predictors of unsuccessful sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in patients with apparent early-stage endometrial cancer (EC) undergoing surgical staging with cervical injection of indocyanine green and SLN biopsy. We retrospectively identified consecutive patients with EC with attempted SLN biopsy between June 2014 and June 2016 at our institution. Patients were grouped according to whether they had a successful procedure, defined as the bilateral identification of SLNs, or an unsuccessful procedure, defined as unilateral or no SLN mapping. Logistic regression was used to evaluate predictors of an unsuccessful procedure. Among 327 patients included in the analysis, 256 (78.3%) had a successful procedure and 71 (21.7%) had an unsuccessful procedure (15.0% unilateral SLN mapping, 6.7% no mapping). The rate of successful procedure increased from 57.7% to 83.3% between the first and last quarters of the 2-year study period, which represented the learning curve for the technique.

Effects of green synthesised silver nanoparticles (ST06-AgNPs) using curcumin derivative (ST06) on human cervical cancer cells (HeLa) in vitro and EAC tumor bearing mice models.,International journal of nanomedicine,Int J Nanomedicine,2019-07-16,"In recent years, green synthesized silver nanoparticles have been increasingly investigated for their anti-cancer potential. In the present study, we aimed at the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using a curcumin derivative, ST06. Although, the individual efficacies of silver nanoparticles or curcumin derivatives have been studied previously, the synergistic cytotoxic effects of curcumin derivative and silver nanoparticles in a single nanoparticulate formulation have not been studied earlier specifically on animal models. This makes this study novel compared to the earlier synthesized curcumin derivative or silver nanoparticles studies. The aim of the study was to synthesize ST06 coated silver nanoparticles (ST06-AgNPs) using ST06 as both reducing and coating agent. The synthesized nanoparticles AgNPs and ST06-AgNPs were characterised for the particle size distribution, morphology, optical properties and surface charge by using UV-visible spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Elemental composition and structural properties were studied by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD). The presence of ST06 as capping agent was demonstrated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The synthesized nanoparticles (ST06-AgNPs) were spherical and had a size distribution in the range of 50-100 nm. UV-Vis spectroscopy displayed a specific silver plasmon peak at 410 nm. The in vitro cytotoxicity effects of ST06 and ST06-AgNPs, as assessed by MTT assay, showed significant growth inhibition of human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa). In addition, studies carried out in EAC tumor-induced mouse model (Ehrlich Ascites carcinoma) using ST06-AgNPs, revealed that treatment of the animals with these nanoparticles resulted in a significant reduction in the tumor growth, compared to the control group animals. In conclusion, green synthesized ST06-AgNPs exhibited superior anti-tumor efficacy than the free ST06 or AgNPs with no acute toxicity under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. The tumor suppression is associated with the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Together, the results of this study suggest that ST06-AgNPs could be considered as a potential option for the treatment of solid tumors.",Journal Article,189.0,0.0,In recent years green synthesized silver nanoparticles have been increasingly investigated for their anti-cancer potential In the present study we aimed at the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles AgNPs using a curcumin derivative ST06 Although the individual efficacies of silver nanoparticles or curcumin derivatives have been studied previously the synergistic cytotoxic effects of curcumin derivative and silver nanoparticles in a single nanoparticulate formulation have not been studied earlier specifically on animal models This makes this study novel compared to the earlier synthesized curcumin derivative or silver nanoparticles studies The aim of the study was to synthesize ST06 coated silver nanoparticles ST06-AgNPs using ST06 as both reducing and coating agent The synthesized nanoparticles AgNPs and ST06-AgNPs were characterised for the particle size distribution morphology optical properties and surface charge by using UV-visible spectroscopy dynamic light scattering DLS and transmission electron microscopy TEM Elemental composition and structural properties were studied by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy EDX and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy XRD The presence of ST06 as capping agent was demonstrated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy FTIR The synthesized nanoparticles ST06-AgNPs were spherical and had a size distribution in the range of 50-100 nm UV-Vis spectroscopy displayed a specific silver plasmon peak at 410 nm The in vitro cytotoxicity effects of ST06 and ST06-AgNPs as assessed by MTT assay showed significant growth inhibition of human cancer cell line HeLa In addition studies carried out in EAC tumor-induced mouse model Ehrlich Ascites carcinoma using ST06-AgNPs revealed that treatment of the animals with these nanoparticles resulted in a significant reduction in the tumor growth compared to the control group animals In conclusion green synthesized ST06-AgNPs exhibited superior anti-tumor efficacy than the free ST06 or AgNPs with no acute toxicity under both in vitro and in vivo conditions The tumor suppression is associated with the intrinsic apoptotic pathway Together the results of this study suggest that ST06-AgNPs could be considered as a potential option for the treatment of solid tumors,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[4, 435, 60, 4658, 5134, 17924, 2889, 47, 85, 1635, 565, 9, 136, 312, 12, 174, 4, 3, 364, 45, 21, 1295, 28, 3, 6225, 1, 17924, 2889, 23035, 75, 8, 3775, 4819, 20130, 242, 3, 797, 14198, 1, 17924, 2889, 15, 3775, 6490, 47, 85, 656, 373, 3, 1806, 759, 176, 1, 3775, 4819, 2, 17924, 2889, 4, 8, 226, 18067, 3583, 47, 44, 85, 656, 1677, 1225, 23, 2026, 274, 26, 4677, 26, 45, 229, 72, 6, 3, 1677, 5134, 3775, 4819, 15, 17924, 2889, 94, 3, 1130, 1, 3, 45, 10, 6, 11254, 20130, 8248, 17924, 2889, 20130, 23035, 75, 20130, 22, 110, 1818, 2, 14737, 420, 3, 5134, 2889, 23035, 2, 20130, 23035, 11, 10715, 9, 3, 5997, 444, 1395, 2567, 4303, 1571, 2, 1255, 11812, 20, 75, 6640, 4822, 5326, 2540, 1691, 7841, 15038, 2, 8151, 4560, 3804, 9594, 24899, 3761, 2, 3281, 1571, 11, 656, 20, 2803, 34656, 1006, 5520, 5326, 23036, 2, 1006, 5520, 32629, 5326, 51510, 3, 463, 1, 20130, 22, 19476, 420, 10, 264, 20, 29367, 7136, 6765, 5326, 51563, 3, 5134, 2889, 20130, 23035, 11, 13312, 2, 42, 8, 444, 1395, 4, 3, 184, 1, 212, 394, 2878, 6640, 18504, 5326, 2507, 8, 112, 17924, 21387, 2944, 28, 7690, 2878, 3, 4, 439, 1408, 176, 1, 20130, 2, 20130, 23035, 22, 275, 20, 4988, 719, 224, 93, 129, 297, 1, 171, 12, 31, 328, 8466, 4, 352, 94, 2629, 1205, 4, 3378, 30, 277, 830, 202, 24203, 3819, 134, 75, 20130, 23035, 553, 17, 24, 1, 3, 2258, 5, 46, 2889, 627, 4, 8, 93, 628, 4, 3, 30, 129, 72, 6, 3, 182, 87, 2258, 4, 1221, 4658, 5134, 20130, 23035, 1416, 1123, 312, 30, 209, 76, 3, 115, 20130, 15, 23035, 5, 77, 286, 155, 669, 110, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 1298, 3, 30, 1332, 16, 41, 5, 3, 2354, 1631, 308, 1162, 3, 99, 1, 26, 45, 309, 17, 20130, 23035, 359, 40, 515, 22, 8, 174, 1501, 9, 3, 24, 1, 537, 57]",2259.0,31409988,391
PARP-1 activity (PAR) determines the sensitivity of cervical cancer to olaparib.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2019-08-18,"Cervical cancer (CC) remains a major health problem worldwide. Poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) have emerged as a promising class of chemotherapeutics in ovarian cancer. We explored the preclinical in vitro and in vivo activity of olaparib against multiple primary whole exome sequenced (WES) CC cells lines and xenografts. Olaparib cell-cycle, apoptosis, homologous-recombination-deficiency (HRD), PARP trapping and cytotoxicity activity was evaluated against 9 primary CC cell lines in vitro. PARP and PAR expression were analyzed by Western blot assays. Finally, olaparib in vivo antitumor activity was tested against CC xenografts. While none of the cell lines demonstrated HRD, three out of 9 (33.3%) primary CC cell lines showed strong PARylation activity and demonstrated high sensitivity to olaparib in vitro treatment (cutoff IC<sub>50</sub> values < 2 μM, p = 0.0012). Olaparib suppressed CC cell growth through cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and caused apoptosis (p < 0.0001). Olaparib activity in CC involved both PARP enzyme inhibition and trapping. In vivo, olaparib significantly impaired CC xenografts tumor growth (p = 0.0017) and increased overall animal survival (p = 0.008). A subset of CC primary cell lines is highly responsive to olaparib treatment in vitro and in vivo.

Gut microbial diversity and genus-level differences identified in cervical cancer patients versus healthy controls.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2019-09-26,"The aim of this study was to characterize variation in the gut microbiome of women with locally advanced cervical cancer and compare it to healthy controls. We characterized the 16S rDNA fecal microbiome in 42 cervical cancer patients and 46 healthy female controls. Shannon diversity index (SDI) was used to evaluate alpha (within sample) diversity. Beta (between sample) diversity was examined using principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) of unweighted Unifrac distances. Relative abundance of microbial taxa was compared between samples using Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size (LEfSe). Within cervical cancer patients, bacterial alpha diversity was positively correlated with age (p = 0.22) but exhibited an inverse relationship in control subjects (p < 0.01). Alpha diversity was significantly higher in cervical cancer patients as compared to controls (p < 0.05), though stratification by age suggested this relationship was restricted to older women (>50 years; p < 0.01). Beta diversity (unweighted Unifrac; p < 0.01) also significantly differed between cervical cancer patients and controls. Based on age- and race-adjusted LEfSe analysis, multiple taxa significantly differed between cervical cancer patients and controls. Prevotella, Porphyromonas, and Dialister were significantly enriched in cervical cancer patients, while Bacteroides, Alistipes and members of the Lachnospiracea family were significantly enriched in healthy subjects.

Patients completed the baseline and at least one post-surgery GCLQ and LVC assessment. The 20-item GCLQ measures seven symptom clusters-aching, heaviness, infection-related, numbness, physical functioning, general swelling, and limb swelling. LLE was defined as a patient self-reported LLE diagnosis on the GCLQ. LVC was measured by volume calculations based on circumferential measurements. A linear mixed model was fitted for change in symptom cluster scores and GCLQ total score and adjusted for disease sites and assessment time. Of 987 eligible patients, 894 were evaluable (endometrial, 719; cervical, 136; vulvar, 39). Of these, 14% reported an LLE diagnosis (endometrial, 11%; cervical, 18%; vulvar, 38%).

Induction of caspase-dependent and -independent apoptosis in response to methionine restriction.,International journal of oncology,Int. J. Oncol.,2003-02-01,"Tumor cells are more sensitive to methionine restriction than normal tissues, a phenomenon known as methionine auxotrophy. Previous studies have demonstrated that methionine restriction causes tumor cell growth arrest and eventually apoptosis. The current studies were undertaken to elucidate the molecular pathways leading to apoptosis induced by methionine restriction. We found that methionine restriction induced formation of oligonucleosomal DNA fragment and cytochrome c release from mitochondria in methionine-dependent PC3 and Hela cells. Methionine restriction also led to cleavage and activation of initiator and effector caspases in Hela cells but not PC3 cells. Furthermore, methionine restriction resulted in cleavage of BID and reduction in Bcl-2 levels in both cell lines. These data suggest that apoptosis induced by methionine restriction is mitochondria-dependent. Methionine restriction induced caspase-independent cell death in PC3 cells, whereas it stimulated caspase-dependent cell death in Hela cells.

CT image-guided intensity-modulated therapy for paraspinal tumors using stereotactic immobilization.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2003-03-01,"To design and implement a noninvasive stereotactic immobilization technique with daily CT image-guided positioning to treat patients with paraspinal lesions accurately and to quantify the systematic and random patient setup errors occurring with this method. A stereotactic body frame (SBF) was developed for ""rigid"" immobilization of paraspinal patients. The inherent accuracy of this system for stereotactic CT-guided treatment was evaluated with phantom studies. Seven patients with thoracic and lumbar spine lesions were immobilized with the SBF and positioned for 33 treatment fractions using daily CT scans. For all 7 patients, the daily setup errors, as assessed from the daily CT scans, were corrected at each treatment fraction. A retrospective analysis was also performed to assess what the impact on patient treatment would have been without the CT-based corrections (i.e., if patient setup had been performed only with the SBF). The average magnitude of systematic and random errors from uncorrected patient setups using the SBF was approximately 2 mm and 1.5 mm (1 SD), respectively. For fixed phantom targets, the system accuracy for the SBF localization and treatment was shown to be within 1 mm (1 SD) in any direction. Dose-volume histograms incorporating these uncertainties for an intensity-modulated radiotherapy plan for lumbar spine lesions were generated, and the effects on the dose-volume histograms were studied. We demonstrated a very accurate and precise method of patient immobilization and treatment delivery based on a noninvasive SBF and daily image guidance for paraspinal lesions. The SBF provides excellent immobilization for paraspinal targets, with setup accuracy better than 2 mm (1 SD). However, for highly conformal paraspinal treatments, uncorrected systematic and random errors of 2 mm in magnitude can result in a significantly greater (>100%) dose to the spinal cord than planned, even though the planned target coverage may not change substantially. With daily CT guidance using the SBF, we showed that the maximal spinal cord dose is ensured to be within 10-15% of the planned value.",Journal Article,6170.0,72.0,To design and implement a noninvasive stereotactic immobilization technique with daily CT image-guided positioning to treat patients with paraspinal lesions accurately and to quantify the systematic and random patient setup errors occurring with this method A stereotactic body frame SBF was developed for `` rigid '' immobilization of paraspinal patients The inherent accuracy of this system for stereotactic CT-guided treatment was evaluated with phantom studies Seven patients with thoracic and lumbar spine lesions were immobilized with the SBF and positioned for 33 treatment fractions using daily CT scans For all 7 patients the daily setup errors as assessed from the daily CT scans were corrected at each treatment fraction A retrospective analysis was also performed to assess what the impact on patient treatment would have been without the CT-based corrections i.e. if patient setup had been performed only with the SBF The average magnitude of systematic and random errors from uncorrected patient setups using the SBF was approximately 2 mm and 1.5 mm 1 SD respectively For fixed phantom targets the system accuracy for the SBF localization and treatment was shown to be within 1 mm 1 SD in any direction Dose-volume histograms incorporating these uncertainties for an intensity-modulated radiotherapy plan for lumbar spine lesions were generated and the effects on the dose-volume histograms were studied We demonstrated a very accurate and precise method of patient immobilization and treatment delivery based on a noninvasive SBF and daily image guidance for paraspinal lesions The SBF provides excellent immobilization for paraspinal targets with setup accuracy better than 2 mm 1 SD However for highly conformal paraspinal treatments uncorrected systematic and random errors of 2 mm in magnitude can result in a significantly greater 100 dose to the spinal cord than planned even though the planned target coverage may not change substantially With daily CT guidance using the SBF we showed that the maximal spinal cord dose is ensured to be within 10-15 of the planned value,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[6, 771, 2, 6207, 8, 2957, 1729, 10161, 1312, 5, 391, 425, 1482, 1808, 7172, 6, 943, 7, 5, 9282, 406, 2141, 2, 6, 3091, 3, 1556, 2, 2324, 69, 4333, 4612, 1821, 5, 26, 596, 8, 1729, 642, 5331, 20077, 10, 276, 9, 12782, 522, 10161, 1, 9282, 7, 3, 4943, 1190, 1, 26, 398, 9, 1729, 425, 1808, 24, 10, 194, 5, 6755, 94, 648, 7, 5, 2098, 2, 6187, 2342, 406, 11, 15093, 5, 3, 20077, 2, 14240, 9, 466, 24, 1550, 75, 391, 425, 1441, 9, 62, 67, 7, 3, 391, 4333, 4612, 22, 275, 29, 3, 391, 425, 1441, 11, 3848, 28, 296, 24, 1509, 8, 459, 65, 10, 120, 173, 6, 423, 2067, 3, 345, 23, 69, 24, 688, 47, 85, 187, 3, 425, 90, 10737, 70, 563, 492, 69, 4333, 42, 85, 173, 158, 5, 3, 20077, 3, 1011, 3131, 1, 1556, 2, 2324, 4612, 29, 18332, 69, 23549, 75, 3, 20077, 10, 705, 18, 321, 2, 14, 33, 321, 14, 1270, 106, 9, 1959, 6755, 637, 3, 398, 1190, 9, 3, 20077, 2145, 2, 24, 10, 443, 6, 40, 262, 14, 321, 14, 1270, 4, 500, 4651, 61, 433, 8638, 2570, 46, 7387, 9, 35, 837, 1757, 310, 2242, 9, 6187, 2342, 406, 11, 1419, 2, 3, 176, 23, 3, 61, 433, 8638, 11, 656, 21, 264, 8, 923, 1481, 2, 3260, 596, 1, 69, 10161, 2, 24, 989, 90, 23, 8, 2957, 20077, 2, 391, 1482, 2753, 9, 9282, 406, 3, 20077, 777, 1503, 10161, 9, 9282, 637, 5, 4333, 1190, 380, 76, 18, 321, 14, 1270, 137, 9, 561, 2972, 9282, 640, 18332, 1556, 2, 2324, 4612, 1, 18, 321, 4, 3131, 122, 757, 4, 8, 97, 378, 394, 61, 6, 3, 1499, 1885, 76, 1465, 871, 2471, 3, 1465, 283, 2139, 68, 44, 707, 2109, 5, 391, 425, 2753, 75, 3, 20077, 21, 224, 17, 3, 2725, 1499, 1885, 61, 16, 23296, 6, 40, 262, 79, 167, 1, 3, 1465, 549]",,12573745,125
Transperitoneal laparoscopic pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection using the argon-beam coagulator and monopolar instruments: an 8-year study and description of technique.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2003-06-01,"The objective was to describe the results, technique, and complications of transperitoneal laparoscopic (LSC) pelvic and aortic lymph node dissection (LND) using the argon-beam coagulator (ABC) and monopolar electrosurgical instruments in women with gynecologic malignancies. A retrospective chart review of 114 patients who underwent LSC pelvic and/or aortic LND in addition to other LSC procedures between 1/1994 and 12/2001 was conducted. All intraoperative complications and complications that occurred within the first 30 postoperative days were included. Complications were graded according to an institutional surgical secondary events reference. During the same time period, 89 patients underwent LSC followed immediately by laparotomy that included LND, resulting in a total of 203 cases. These 203 total cases are used as a denominator to determine the etiology of cases converted from LSC to laparotomy. Monopolar electrosurgical instruments or the 10-mm ABC (Conmed) set at 70 W with argon flow of 3-4 L/m min were used for laparoscopic nodal dissection. Sixty-one of 114 (53%) patients underwent pelvic LND, 35 (31%) underwent both pelvic and aortic LND, and 18 (16%) underwent aortic LND only. Mean patient age and body mass index were 53.3 years (range, 16 to 87 years) and 25 (range, 16 to 40), respectively. In addition, the mean number of pelvic and aortic lymph nodes removed was 10.7 (range, 1 to 39) and 5.7 (range, 0 to 21), respectively. The mean estimated blood loss was 151 mL (range, 25 to 600 ml) and the mean hospital stay was 2.8 days (range, 0 to 35 days). Overall, complications occurred in eight (7%) cases. There were no fatal complications, and no patient required conversion to laparotomy due to uncontrollable bleeding from the laparoscopic nodal dissection. Only 17 of 203 (8%) patients required conversion to laparotomy secondary to adhesions and unsatisfactory exposure. Laparoscopic pelvic and aortic LND for gynecologic malignancies can be satisfactorily performed in the majority of patients, with only 8% of patients requiring conversion to laparotomy due to adhesions or unsatisfactory exposure.

Low-molecular-weight heparin (dalteparin) in women with gynecologic malignancy.,Obstetrics and gynecology,Obstet Gynecol,2005-05-01,"To compare the efficacy of dalteparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin, to unfractionated heparin (UFH) in the prevention of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism in patients after surgery for gynecologic malignancy. The medical records of all patients undergoing major surgery on the Gynecologic Oncology Service at the Massachusetts General Hospital from July 2002 through April 2003 were reviewed. Patients with confirmed malignancy were included. Between July 1, 2002, and November 15, 2002, dalteparin (5,000 U subcutaneously each day) was used for postoperative prophylaxis for DVT and pulmonary embolus. After November 15, 2002, the method of prophylaxis was changed to UFH (5,000 U subcutaneously every 8 hours) exclusively. Patients were evaluated for DVT or pulmonary embolus based on clinical suspicion using computed tomographic angiography, ventilation and perfusion scan, or lower extremity doppler. A total of 214 patients were identified who met study criteria. Dalteparin was administered to 103 patients, and UFH was administered to 111. The rates of clinically significant DVT or pulmonary embolus in patients receiving dalteparin and UFH were 8.9% and 1.2%, respectively (P = .009). Major risk factors for DVT or pulmonary embolus, including age, obesity, duration of surgery, and type of malignancy, did not differ between groups. There were no significant differences in bleeding complications or transfusion requirements between groups. The low-molecular-weight heparin dalteparin dosed 5,000 U daily is inadequate postoperative prophylaxis in women undergoing surgery for gynecologic cancer.

Using navigators to improve care of underserved patients: current practices and approaches.,Cancer,Cancer,2005-08-01,"Logistic, cultural, educational, and other barriers can impede the delivery of high-quality cancer care to underserved patients. Patient navigation services represent one innovation for addressing perceived barriers to care encountered by disadvantaged patients. In this report, the authors have 1) defined patient navigation, distinguishing it from other cancer support services; 2) described how programs are organized; and 3) discussed the need for research on program effectiveness. Information was examined on navigation programs published in the scientific literature and on line. Qualitative research also was conducted, consisting of direct observation of patient care in cancer clinics with and without navigators in northern California, in-person interviews with personnel and patients in the clinics observed, and telephone interviews with navigators at four sites across the United States. The authors found that navigation services have been implemented at all stages of cancer care: prevention, screening, treatment, and survival. Navigators differ from other cancer support personnel in their orientation toward flexible problem solving to overcome perceived barriers to care rather than the provision of a predefined set of services. There are no rigorous demonstrations of the effects and effectiveness of navigation, although such studies are underway. Currently, patient navigation is understudied, and literature documenting its effects and effectiveness is scant. Rigorous studies are needed of the navigator role and program costs and benefits.

Intrathoracic leaks following esophagectomy are no longer associated with increased mortality.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2005-09-01,"Assess outcomes following intrathoracic leaks after esophagectomy from 1970 to 2004 to evaluate the impact of evolving surgical and perioperative techniques on leak-associated mortality (LAM). An intrathoracic leak following esophagectomy has historically been considered a catastrophic event, with mortality as high as 71%. Concerns about this complication often affect choice of surgical approach for esophagectomy. A retrospective review of all esophagectomies for cancer from 1970 to 2004 (n = 1223) was performed. Outcomes following intrathoracic anastomoses (n = 621) were analyzed by era: historical 1970-1986 (n = 145) and modern 1987-2004 (n = 476). There was no difference in the frequency of leak between the time intervals (4.8% versus 6.3%, P = 0.5). Despite a significant increase in the use of preoperative chemoradiation (1% versus 42%, P < 0.001) in the historical versus modern era, the overall mortality decreased from 11% to 2.5% (P < 0.001). The LAM was markedly reduced from 43% to 3.3% (P = 0.016). Factors associated with LAM included failure to use enteral nutrition (HR 13.22, CI 1.8-96.8) and era in which the surgery was performed (HR 18.3, 1.9-180). Other differences included an increased proportion of successful reoperations for leak control (11/30 versus 0/7, P = 0.08) and use of reinforcing muscle flaps (7/11). In the modern era, perioperative mortality is not significantly different for patients with or without intrathoracic leaks (3.3% versus 2.5%, P = 0.55), nor is long-term survival (P = 0.16). Modern surgical management of intrathoracic leaks results in no increased mortality and has no impact on long-term survival.

Fertility-sparing options for patients with gynecologic malignancies.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2005-09-01,"Gynecologic malignancies are most often diagnosed in postmenopausal women, but these malignancies also arise in premenopausal women, in whom issues of fertility can be a major concern. An increasing number of women are delaying childbearing. This has led to a significant increase in the number of women diagnosed with a gynecologic malignancy before desired completion of childbearing.

A novel model of intramedullary spinal cord tumors in rats: functional progression and histopathological characterization.,Neurosurgery,Neurosurgery,2006-07-01,"Intramedullary spinal cord tumors are difficult lesions to treat given their recurrence rate and limited treatment options. The absence of an adequate animal model, however, has hindered the development of new treatment paradigms. In this study, we describe the technique for intramedullary injection of two experimental rodent gliomas (9L and F98) and present the methodology for functional and histopathological analysis of tumor progression. F344 rats (n = 24) were randomized into three groups. Group 1 (n = 8) received a 5 microl intramedullary injection of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium, Group 2 received a 5 microl intramedullary injection of 9L gliosarcoma (100,000) cells, and Group 3 received a 5 microl intramedullary injection of F98 glioma (100,000) cells. The animals were anesthetized, a 2 cm incision was made in the dorsal mid-thoracic region, and the spinous process of the T5 vertebrae was removed to expose the intervertebral space. The ligamentum flavum was removed, and an intramedullary injection was made into the spinal cord. The animals were evaluated daily for signs of paralysis using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale and sacrificed after the onset of deficits for histopathological analysis. Animals injected with 9L-gliosarcoma had a median onset of hind limb paresis at 12 +/- 2.9 days. Animals injected with F98 glioma had a median onset of hind limb paresis at 19 +/- 3 days. Animals injected with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium did not show neurological deficits. Hematoxylin-eosin cross sections confirmed the presence of intramedullary 9L and F98 tumor invading the spinal cord. Control animals had no significant histopathological findings. Animals injected with 9L or F98 consistently developed hind limb paresis in a reliable and reproducible manner. The progression of neurological deficits is similar to that seen in patients with intramedullary spinal cord tumors.

Predicting absolute risk of CIN3 during post-colposcopic follow-up: results from the ASCUS-LSIL Triage Study (ALTS).,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol.,2006-08-01,"At present, clinical management of women referred to colposcopy but found to have <CIN2 remains unclear. Using data from the ASCUS-LSIL Triage Study (ALTS) to inform clinical management, we calculated the absolute risk for developing CIN3 within 2 years of referral to an enrollment colposcopy. Women included in the analyses: (1) were initially referred to ALTS with a community cytologic interpretation of atypical squamous cell of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL); (2) had a colposcopic evaluation and biopsy, if indicated, resulting in a diagnosis <CIN2; and, therefore (3) were followed without treatment. Results from subsequent human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, liquid-based cytology interpretations, and a second colposcopic evaluation at least 6 months after and within 2 years of the first colposcopic evaluation were used to calculate absolute risks for CIN3. Women with HPV-negative test results were at low risk for CIN3 regardless of other test results. Among HPV-positive women, increasing absolute risks of CIN3 were observed with increasing cytology severity: 7% (normal), 11% (ASCUS and LSIL), and 45% (HSIL).

Prior chemotherapy was allowed only in the context of radiation ""sensitization"". Genotyping in the 5' and 3' ends of thymidylate synthase (TS) was performed in DNA from pretreatment blood. Relative gene expression of TS, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) and thymidine phosphorylase (TP) was quantified in RNA extracted from paraffin-embedded tumor. All patients had prior radiotherapy and 22 received a radiation sensitizer. A partial response was observed in 4 of 26 (15%) evaluable patients. An additional 35% of patients achieved stable disease while 42% experienced increasing disease. The most common serious non-hematological toxicities were gastrointestinal and dermatologic. Exploratory analyses suggested that: a germline polymorphism in the 3' or the 5' end of TS was not associated with TS gene expression, relative tumor expression of TS, DPD and TP were not correlated, and relative tumor expression of TP may predict severe anemia.

Radiation therapy with or without weekly cisplatin for bulky stage 1B cervical carcinoma: follow-up of a Gynecologic Oncology Group trial.,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol.,2007-11-01,"The objective of the study was to confirm that concurrent cisplatin (CT) with radiation therapy (RT) is associated with improved long-term progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), compared with RT alone in stage IB bulky carcinoma of the cervix, when both groups' therapy is followed by hysterectomy. Three hundred seventy-four patients entered this trial. There were 369 evaluable patients; 186 were randomly allocated to receive RT alone and 183 to receive CT plus RT. Radiation dosage was 45 Gray (Gy) in 20 fractions followed by low dose-rate intracavitary application(s) of 30 Gy to point A. Chemotherapy consisted of intravenous cisplatin 40 mg/m2 every week for up to 6 weekly cycles. Total extrafascial hysterectomy followed the completion of RT by 6-8 weeks. Preliminary results have been published, at which time there were 292 censored observations, and median duration of follow-up was only 36 months. Patient and tumor characteristics were well balanced between the regimens. The median patient age was 41.5 years; 81% had squamous tumors; 59% were white. Median follow-up is now 101 months. The relative risk for progression was 0.61 favoring CT plus RT (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.43 to 0.85, P < .004). At 72 months, 71% of patients receiving CT plus RT were predicted to be alive and disease free when adjusting for age and tumor size, compared with 60% of those receiving RT alone. The adjusted death hazard ratio was 0.63 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.91, P < .015) favoring CT plus RT. At 72 months, 78% of CT plus RT patients were predicted to be alive, compared with 64% of RT patients. An increased rate of early hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity was seen with CT plus RT. There was no detectable difference in the frequency of late adverse events. Concurrent weekly cisplatin with RT significantly improves long-term PFS and OS when compared with RT alone. Serious late effects were not increased. The inclusion of hysterectomy has been discontinued on the basis of another trial.

Frozen-section evaluation of cervical adenocarcinoma at time of radical trachelectomy: pathologic pitfalls and the application of an objective scoring system.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2008-07-17,"To analyze the incidence of diagnostic discrepancy between frozen-section and final diagnosis of the endocervical margin at time of radical trachelectomy and to apply an objective scoring system to non-invasive endocervical glandular atypia to determine its utility in distinguishing benign from malignant lesions. Histologic slides from 19 cases of radical trachelectomy performed for invasive endocervical adenocarcinoma were evaluated for correlation between the frozen and permanent sections of the endocervical margin. An objective scoring system for grading non-invasive endocervical glandular lesions proposed by Ioffe et al. was also applied to the frozen and permanent section slides and compared to the final diagnosis. There was 84% concordance between the frozen-section and final diagnosis using histology alone, vs. 95% concordance using the Ioffe scoring system. One trachelectomy was converted to completion hysterectomy for what was presumed to be adenocarcinoma in situ at the margin, which in retrospect, was a benign lesion and was correctly classified using the Ioffe system. Most of the discrepancies were due to misinterpretation of tubal metaplasia, tubo-endometrioid metaplasia, and atypical tubal metaplasia as adenocarcinoma in situ. Benign mimics of endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ can be difficult to distinguish from malignant lesions, especially during frozen-section evaluation of the trachelectomy. Correctly diagnosing the margin status intraoperatively has great clinical impact and the application of an objective scoring system, like that proposed by Ioffe et al., can increase diagnostic accuracy when applied to frozen-section slides and better correlates with final diagnosis when compared to histology alone.",Journal Article,4205.0,15.0,To analyze the incidence of diagnostic discrepancy between frozen-section and final diagnosis of the endocervical margin at time of radical trachelectomy and to apply an objective scoring system to non-invasive endocervical glandular atypia to determine its utility in distinguishing benign from malignant lesions Histologic slides from 19 cases of radical trachelectomy performed for invasive endocervical adenocarcinoma were evaluated for correlation between the frozen and permanent sections of the endocervical margin An objective scoring system for grading non-invasive endocervical glandular lesions proposed by Ioffe et al was also applied to the frozen and permanent section slides and compared to the final diagnosis There was 84 concordance between the frozen-section and final diagnosis using histology alone vs. 95 concordance using the Ioffe scoring system One trachelectomy was converted to completion hysterectomy for what was presumed to be adenocarcinoma in situ at the margin which in retrospect was a benign lesion and was correctly classified using the Ioffe system Most of the discrepancies were due to misinterpretation of tubal metaplasia tubo-endometrioid metaplasia and atypical tubal metaplasia as adenocarcinoma in situ Benign mimics of endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ can be difficult to distinguish from malignant lesions especially during frozen-section evaluation of the trachelectomy Correctly diagnosing the margin status intraoperatively has great clinical impact and the application of an objective scoring system like that proposed by Ioffe et al. can increase diagnostic accuracy when applied to frozen-section slides and better correlates with final diagnosis when compared to histology alone,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[6, 1992, 3, 287, 1, 752, 7916, 59, 3015, 2917, 2, 1457, 147, 1, 3, 10174, 959, 28, 98, 1, 711, 5760, 2, 6, 4930, 35, 461, 2504, 398, 6, 220, 416, 10174, 6170, 3598, 6, 223, 211, 1207, 4, 4508, 1002, 29, 393, 406, 884, 3830, 29, 326, 140, 1, 711, 5760, 173, 9, 416, 10174, 449, 11, 194, 9, 816, 59, 3, 3015, 2, 4377, 3013, 1, 3, 10174, 959, 35, 461, 2504, 398, 9, 3452, 220, 416, 10174, 6170, 406, 1587, 20, 36839, 2022, 2171, 10, 120, 1498, 6, 3, 3015, 2, 4377, 2917, 3830, 2, 72, 6, 3, 1457, 147, 125, 10, 874, 1827, 59, 3, 3015, 2917, 2, 1457, 147, 75, 784, 279, 105, 48, 1827, 75, 3, 36839, 2504, 398, 104, 5760, 10, 4764, 6, 1438, 2622, 9, 2067, 10, 5472, 6, 40, 449, 4, 957, 28, 3, 959, 92, 4, 41875, 10, 8, 1002, 1180, 2, 10, 4911, 1373, 75, 3, 36839, 398, 96, 1, 3, 7631, 11, 520, 6, 22357, 1, 6674, 6054, 36350, 3151, 6054, 2, 1973, 6674, 6054, 22, 449, 4, 957, 1002, 7557, 1, 10174, 449, 4, 957, 122, 40, 1740, 6, 3081, 29, 393, 406, 1093, 190, 3015, 2917, 451, 1, 3, 5760, 4911, 5798, 3, 959, 156, 6595, 71, 2797, 38, 345, 2, 3, 1581, 1, 35, 461, 2504, 398, 733, 17, 1587, 20, 36839, 2022, 2171, 122, 344, 752, 1190, 198, 1498, 6, 3015, 2917, 3830, 2, 380, 1871, 5, 1457, 147, 198, 72, 6, 784, 279]",,18635252,640

Activation of Akt as a mechanism for tumor immune evasion.,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,Mol. Ther.,2008-12-23,"Immune evasion is an important reason why the immune system cannot control tumor growth. To elucidate the mechanism for tumor immune evasion, we generated an immune-resistant human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7-expressing tumor cell line by subjecting a susceptible tumor cell line to multiple rounds of in vivo immune selection with an E7-specific vaccine. Comparison of parental and immune-resistant tumors revealed that Akt is highly activated in the immune-resistant tumors. Retroviral transfer of a constitutively active form of Akt into the parental tumor significantly increased its resistance against E7-specific CD8(+) T-cell mediated apoptosis. The observed resistance against apoptosis was found to be associated with the upregulation of antiapoptotic molecules. We also observed that intratumoral injection of an Akt inhibitor enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of E7-specific vaccine or E7-specific CD8(+) T-cell adoptive transfer against the immune-resistant tumors. Thus, our data indicate that the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway represents a new mechanism of immune escape and has important implications for the development of a novel strategy in cancer immunotherapy against immune-resistant tumor cells.",Journal Article,4046.0,59.0,Immune evasion is an important reason why the immune system can not control tumor growth To elucidate the mechanism for tumor immune evasion we generated an immune-resistant human papillomavirus type 16 HPV-16 E7-expressing tumor cell line by subjecting a susceptible tumor cell line to multiple rounds of in vivo immune selection with an E7-specific vaccine Comparison of parental and immune-resistant tumors revealed that Akt is highly activated in the immune-resistant tumors Retroviral transfer of a constitutively active form of Akt into the parental tumor significantly increased its resistance against E7-specific CD8 T-cell mediated apoptosis The observed resistance against apoptosis was found to be associated with the upregulation of antiapoptotic molecules We also observed that intratumoral injection of an Akt inhibitor enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of E7-specific vaccine or E7-specific CD8 T-cell adoptive transfer against the immune-resistant tumors Thus our data indicate that the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway represents a new mechanism of immune escape and has important implications for the development of a novel strategy in cancer immunotherapy against immune-resistant tumor cells,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[250, 5351, 16, 35, 305, 3852, 5283, 3, 250, 398, 122, 44, 182, 30, 129, 6, 3061, 3, 670, 9, 30, 250, 5351, 21, 1419, 35, 250, 436, 171, 3242, 267, 245, 933, 245, 4540, 1046, 30, 31, 328, 20, 39186, 8, 4012, 30, 31, 328, 6, 232, 7001, 1, 4, 386, 250, 881, 5, 35, 4540, 112, 1274, 1155, 1, 3418, 2, 250, 436, 57, 553, 17, 649, 16, 561, 735, 4, 3, 250, 436, 57, 8658, 2602, 1, 8, 2818, 544, 1297, 1, 649, 237, 3, 3418, 30, 97, 101, 211, 251, 480, 4540, 112, 968, 102, 31, 517, 351, 3, 164, 251, 480, 351, 10, 204, 6, 40, 41, 5, 3, 2218, 1, 4176, 1598, 21, 120, 164, 17, 2074, 1754, 1, 35, 649, 230, 651, 3, 189, 209, 1, 4540, 112, 1274, 15, 4540, 112, 968, 102, 31, 3159, 2602, 480, 3, 250, 436, 57, 631, 114, 74, 1008, 17, 3, 363, 1, 974, 649, 308, 1449, 8, 217, 670, 1, 250, 3776, 2, 71, 305, 1268, 9, 3, 193, 1, 8, 229, 692, 4, 12, 726, 480, 250, 436, 30, 37]",,19107122,266
Predictive value of a proposed subclassification of stages I and II cervical cancer based on clinical tumor diameter.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int.

Cancer,2009-01-01,"Hospital records of 4490 patients treated for International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IB, IIA, or IIB carcinoma of the cervix between 1960 and 2001 at 1 institution were reviewed. Outcomes were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank method. A proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate the relative importance of predictive factors. The rates of disease-specific survival and pelvic disease control were strongly correlated with tumor diameter, FIGO stage, histological subtype, and clinical node status. Regression analysis demonstrated that a diameter of greater than 4 cm, a diameter of greater than 6 cm, FIGO stage II (vs IB), the presence and level of lymph node involvement, and histological subtype were all highly significant independent predictors of poor disease-specific survival. Intermediate tumor-diameter categories (>5 cm or >7 cm) and FIGO stage IIB (vs IB or IIA) did not contribute significant additional information to the model. Only a tumor diameter of greater than 4 cm, a diameter of greater than 6 cm, the presence of lymph node involvement, and histological subtype were independent predictors of pelvic disease control. On the basis of these results, we propose dividing each of the FIGO categories IB, IIA, and IIB into 3 groups according to clinical tumor diameter: (1) less than or equal to 4 cm, (2) 4.1 to 6 cm, and (3) greater than 6 cm.

A prospective randomized trial comparing patient-controlled epidural analgesia to patient-controlled intravenous analgesia on postoperative pain control and recovery after major open gynecologic cancer surgery.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2009-04-23,"To determine the effect of perioperative patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) compared to postoperative intravenous (IV) patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) on postoperative recovery parameters after major open gynecologic surgery. A randomized controlled clinical trial included women undergoing laparotomy for a gynecologic disorder. Patients were randomized to postoperative IV morphine PCA (control arm) or to postoperative morphine-bupivacaine PCEA (treatment arm). Postoperative outcomes such as pain, and length of hospital stay were compared with an intention-to-treat analysis. The primary endpoint was postoperative pain at rest and when coughing--assessed by a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS). Between 9/04 and 6/07, 153 patients were randomized and 135 were evaluable (PCEA=67; PCA=68). Over 75% of the women in this study had gynecologic cancer. Patients in the PCEA arm had significantly less postoperative pain at rest on Day 1 and during the first 3 postoperative days when coughing compared to the PCA arm (P<0.05). The mean pain score at rest on Day 1 was 3.3 for the PCEA group compared to 4.3 for the PCA group (P=0.01).

Incremental value of using Medicaid claim files to study comorbid conditions and treatments in dually eligible beneficiaries.,Medical care,Med Care,2010-01-01,"Although investigations using Medicare claims files are ubiquitous in the health services research literature, Medicaid claims files are used less frequently. Nonetheless, Medicaid is the major payer for healthcare among low-income persons. To assess the added value of Medicaid claim files for identifying comorbid conditions and cancer treatments in a dually eligible sample. Data were obtained from linked statewide tumor registries from 2 contiguous Midwestern states (Michigan and Ohio), Medicare and Medicaid enrollment files, and Medicare and Medicaid claims files. We estimated the prevalence of Charlson Comorbidity Index conditions by counting the number of patients with these conditions in the Medicare claims files alone. We then estimate the expected percent increase in the prevalence of comorbid conditions (along with the 95% confidence interval) that could be obtained by using both Medicare and Medicaid claim files. We followed a similar procedure to identify treatments provided to dually eligible patients. Medicaid claims added very few individuals with comorbid conditions over those identified through Medicare claim files. The increase in the prevalence of comorbid conditions was between 0% and 2.5%. Likewise, Medicaid claims identified few individuals with cancer treatments who were not already identified through Medicare claim files, although variations were noted between the 2 states.

Repeat decompression surgery for recurrent spinal metastases.,Journal of neurosurgery. Spine,J Neurosurg Spine,2010-07-01,"OBJECT In this paper, the authors' goal was to determine the outcome of reoperation for recurrent epidural spinal cord compression in patients with metastatic spine disease. METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients who underwent spine surgery at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between 1996 and 2007. Thirty-nine patients who underwent reoperation of the spine at the level previously treated with surgery were identified. Only patients whose reoperation was performed because of tumor recurrence leading to high-grade epidural spinal cord compression or recurrence with no further radiation options were included in the study. Patients who underwent reoperations exclusively for instrumentation failure were excluded. All patients underwent additional decompression via a posterolateral approach without removal of the spinal instrumentation. RESULTS Patients underwent 1-4 reoperations at the same level. A median survival time of 12.4 months was noted after the first reoperation, and a median survival time of 9.1 months was noted after the last reoperation. At last follow-up 22 (65%) of 34 patients were ambulatory at the time of last follow-up or death, and the median time between loss-of-ambulation and death was 1 month. Functional status was maintained or improved by one Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group grade in 97% of patients. A major surgical complication rate of 5% was noted. CONCLUSIONS Reoperation represents a viable option in patients with high-grade epidural spinal cord compression who have recurrent metastatic tumors at previously operated spinal levels. In carefully selected patients, reoperation can prolong ambulation and result in good functional and neurological outcomes.",Journal Article,3491.0,21.0,OBJECT In this paper the authors goal was to determine the outcome of reoperation for recurrent epidural spinal cord compression in patients with metastatic spine disease METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients who underwent spine surgery at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between 1996 and 2007 Thirty-nine patients who underwent reoperation of the spine at the level previously treated with surgery were identified Only patients whose reoperation was performed because of tumor recurrence leading to high-grade epidural spinal cord compression or recurrence with no further radiation options were included in the study Patients who underwent reoperations exclusively for instrumentation failure were excluded All patients underwent additional decompression via a posterolateral approach without removal of the spinal instrumentation RESULTS Patients underwent 1-4 reoperations at the same level A median survival time of 12.4 months was noted after the first reoperation and a median survival time of 9.1 months was noted after the last reoperation At last follow-up 22 65 of 34 patients were ambulatory at the time of last follow-up or death and the median time between loss-of-ambulation and death was 1 month Functional status was maintained or improved by one Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group grade in 97 of patients A major surgical complication rate of 5 was noted CONCLUSIONS Reoperation represents a viable option in patients with high-grade epidural spinal cord compression who have recurrent metastatic tumors at previously operated spinal levels In carefully selected patients reoperation can prolong ambulation and result in good functional and neurological outcomes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[12381, 4, 26, 2817, 3, 738, 1326, 10, 6, 223, 3, 228, 1, 5077, 9, 387, 5844, 1499, 1885, 3481, 4, 7, 5, 113, 2342, 34, 636, 8, 459, 2937, 206, 10, 426, 1, 62, 7, 54, 208, 2342, 152, 28, 3, 2563, 2783, 2784, 12, 574, 59, 2648, 2, 1307, 977, 762, 7, 54, 208, 5077, 1, 3, 2342, 28, 3, 301, 373, 73, 5, 152, 11, 108, 158, 7, 1310, 5077, 10, 173, 408, 1, 30, 146, 1049, 6, 64, 88, 5844, 1499, 1885, 3481, 15, 146, 5, 77, 195, 121, 838, 11, 159, 4, 3, 45, 7, 54, 208, 10691, 4437, 9, 9166, 496, 11, 1800, 62, 7, 208, 402, 7638, 847, 8, 13000, 353, 187, 2829, 1, 3, 1499, 9166, 99, 7, 208, 14, 39, 10691, 28, 3, 827, 301, 8, 52, 25, 98, 1, 133, 39, 53, 10, 1051, 50, 3, 157, 5077, 2, 8, 52, 25, 98, 1, 83, 14, 53, 10, 1051, 50, 3, 1060, 5077, 28, 1060, 166, 126, 350, 556, 1, 562, 7, 11, 4154, 28, 3, 98, 1, 1060, 166, 126, 15, 273, 2, 3, 52, 98, 59, 407, 1, 13952, 2, 273, 10, 14, 811, 583, 156, 10, 1955, 15, 231, 20, 104, 2118, 1690, 413, 87, 88, 4, 1015, 1, 7, 8, 458, 221, 1447, 116, 1, 33, 10, 1051, 2130, 5077, 1449, 8, 2663, 1501, 4, 7, 5, 64, 88, 5844, 1499, 1885, 3481, 54, 47, 387, 113, 57, 28, 373, 7297, 1499, 148, 4, 3900, 715, 7, 5077, 122, 3615, 13952, 2, 757, 4, 1178, 583, 2, 3622, 123]",,20594025,179
Symptom research in gynecologic oncology: a review of available measurement tools.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2010-08-04,"Cancer and its treatment produce multiple symptoms that significantly distress patients and impair function. Effective symptom management requires effective symptom assessment. A variety of measurement instruments have been created to identify symptoms in oncology practice. Here we review symptom assessment measures available for gynecologic cancers. A systematic literature search was performed to identify articles on symptom assessment and quality-of-life instruments in gynecologic oncology. Articles were accessed through searches performed in PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, and the Cochrane Library. Studies were selected if they described development of symptom assessment tools for diagnosis and measurement of symptoms of gynecologic cancers and treatments. We also included studies using quality-of-life measurement tools that contained symptom items. Nine studies examined symptom assessment, quality-of-life assessment, or symptom indexes for various gynecologic cancers. Studies varied in design, patient profiles, symptoms assessed, and outcomes measured. Meta-analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity in the studies. Although pain is well-studied and well-characterized, other disease-specific and general systemic symptoms of gynecologic cancers need better understanding and assessment. Accordingly, assessment of symptoms throughout the course of disease is crucial for treatment decisions and outcomes monitoring for patients with gynecologic cancer. This is especially true for survivors of gynecologic cancer, for patients whose treatment was unsuccessful, or for choosing between treatments with comparable survival outcomes. However, measurement and assessment of cancer-related symptoms is challenging because of the complex interaction between disease progression, multi-modality treatments, and symptoms. In this review, we evaluate the currently available symptom assessment tools for gynecologic cancers, along with quality-of-life assessment tools that include symptom items, and we give recommendations for further research.",Journal Article,3457.0,13.0,Cancer and its treatment produce multiple symptoms that significantly distress patients and impair function Effective symptom management requires effective symptom assessment A variety of measurement instruments have been created to identify symptoms in oncology practice Here we review symptom assessment measures available for gynecologic cancers A systematic literature search was performed to identify articles on symptom assessment and quality-of-life instruments in gynecologic oncology Articles were accessed through searches performed in PubMed MEDLINE CINAHL Plus and the Cochrane Library Studies were selected if they described development of symptom assessment tools for diagnosis and measurement of symptoms of gynecologic cancers and treatments We also included studies using quality-of-life measurement tools that contained symptom items Nine studies examined symptom assessment quality-of-life assessment or symptom indexes for various gynecologic cancers Studies varied in design patient profiles symptoms assessed and outcomes measured Meta-analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity in the studies Although pain is well-studied and well-characterized other disease-specific and general systemic symptoms of gynecologic cancers need better understanding and assessment Accordingly assessment of symptoms throughout the course of disease is crucial for treatment decisions and outcomes monitoring for patients with gynecologic cancer This is especially true for survivors of gynecologic cancer for patients whose treatment was unsuccessful or for choosing between treatments with comparable survival outcomes However measurement and assessment of cancer-related symptoms is challenging because of the complex interaction between disease progression multi-modality treatments and symptoms In this review we evaluate the currently available symptom assessment tools for gynecologic cancers along with quality-of-life assessment tools that include symptom items and we give recommendations for further research,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[12, 2, 211, 24, 2410, 232, 507, 17, 97, 1462, 7, 2, 6267, 343, 323, 934, 284, 1706, 323, 934, 455, 8, 1362, 1, 2204, 4730, 47, 85, 2466, 6, 255, 507, 4, 413, 758, 467, 21, 206, 934, 455, 1018, 390, 9, 1512, 163, 8, 1556, 789, 1901, 10, 173, 6, 255, 2384, 23, 934, 455, 2, 372, 1, 358, 4730, 4, 1512, 413, 2384, 11, 11276, 298, 6769, 173, 4, 3161, 3388, 14657, 349, 2, 3, 4956, 4157, 94, 11, 715, 492, 491, 1027, 193, 1, 934, 455, 1896, 9, 147, 2, 2204, 1, 507, 1, 1512, 163, 2, 640, 21, 120, 159, 94, 75, 372, 1, 358, 2204, 1896, 17, 3070, 934, 2980, 762, 94, 409, 934, 455, 372, 1, 358, 455, 15, 934, 11480, 9, 747, 1512, 163, 94, 2051, 4, 771, 69, 1241, 507, 275, 2, 123, 644, 1742, 65, 10, 44, 173, 520, 6, 1144, 4, 3, 94, 242, 559, 16, 149, 656, 2, 149, 765, 127, 34, 112, 2, 1083, 403, 507, 1, 1512, 163, 594, 380, 612, 2, 455, 4705, 455, 1, 507, 2432, 3, 906, 1, 34, 16, 2653, 9, 24, 1526, 2, 123, 1315, 9, 7, 5, 1512, 12, 26, 16, 1093, 2501, 9, 332, 1, 1512, 12, 9, 7, 1310, 24, 10, 7581, 15, 9, 5065, 59, 640, 5, 1279, 25, 123, 137, 2204, 2, 455, 1, 12, 139, 507, 16, 1950, 408, 1, 3, 840, 915, 59, 34, 91, 1414, 1396, 640, 2, 507, 4, 26, 206, 21, 376, 3, 694, 390, 934, 455, 1896, 9, 1512, 163, 1510, 5, 372, 1, 358, 455, 1896, 17, 643, 934, 2980, 2, 21, 4978, 883, 9, 195, 389]",,20688364,799

Concurrent sulforaphane and eugenol induces differential effects on human cervical cancer cells.,Integrative cancer therapies,Integr Cancer Ther,2011-03-07,"The concept of combination of chemoprevention holds great potential for cancer management as lower, clinically tolerable doses of individual agents could be achieved through therapeutic synergy. However, elucidation of their possible interactions--additive, synergistic, or antagonistic--must be thoroughly studied before considering for clinical use. To evaluate the effect of combination treatment of sulforaphane (SFN) and eugenol on HeLa cells, the authors performed cell viability assay, apoptosis assay, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for gene expression analysis. Calculations of combination effects were expressed as a combination index (CI) with CI < 1, CI = 1, or CI > 1 representing synergism, additivity, or antagonism, respectively. Simultaneous treatment with variable dose combinations of SFN and eugenol resulted in differential effects with an antagonistic effect at lower and synergistic at higher sub-lethal doses as reflected in cell cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction. Importantly, gemcitabine used in conjunction with the low- and high-dose combinations showed no significant cell death at lower doses suggesting that cell cytotoxicity is proportional to gemcitabine alone, whereas at higher sublethal doses of SFN and eugenol, it was found to act in a synergistic manner with gemcitabine. Furthermore, SFN and eugenol combinations at synergistic dose significantly downregulated the expression of Bcl-2, COX-2 and IL-β but not the antagonistic combinations. This study clearly indicates that 2 (or more) chemopreventive agents can act antagonistically or synergistically necessitating elucidation of possible mechanistic interactions for favorable and reliable outcomes of dietary components in the field of cancer prevention.",Journal Article,3242.0,24.0,The concept of combination of chemoprevention holds great potential for cancer management as lower clinically tolerable doses of individual agents could be achieved through therapeutic synergy However elucidation of their possible interactions -- additive synergistic or antagonistic -- must be thoroughly studied before considering for clinical use To evaluate the effect of combination treatment of sulforaphane SFN and eugenol on HeLa cells the authors performed cell viability assay apoptosis assay and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for gene expression analysis Calculations of combination effects were expressed as a combination index CI with CI 1 CI 1 or CI 1 representing synergism additivity or antagonism respectively Simultaneous treatment with variable dose combinations of SFN and eugenol resulted in differential effects with an antagonistic effect at lower and synergistic at higher sub-lethal doses as reflected in cell cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction Importantly gemcitabine used in conjunction with the low- and high-dose combinations showed no significant cell death at lower doses suggesting that cell cytotoxicity is proportional to gemcitabine alone whereas at higher sublethal doses of SFN and eugenol it was found to act in a synergistic manner with gemcitabine Furthermore SFN and eugenol combinations at synergistic dose significantly downregulated the expression of Bcl-2 COX-2 and IL-β but not the antagonistic combinations This study clearly indicates that 2 or more chemopreventive agents can act antagonistically or synergistically necessitating elucidation of possible mechanistic interactions for favorable and reliable outcomes of dietary components in the field of cancer prevention,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[3, 2545, 1, 150, 1, 2886, 5253, 2797, 174, 9, 12, 284, 22, 280, 505, 2668, 415, 1, 797, 183, 359, 40, 513, 298, 189, 3439, 137, 7481, 1, 136, 899, 1286, 3396, 1806, 15, 9863, 1642, 40, 11576, 656, 348, 3075, 9, 38, 119, 6, 376, 3, 254, 1, 150, 24, 1, 9510, 10481, 2, 20743, 23, 8466, 37, 3, 738, 173, 31, 2120, 719, 351, 719, 2, 1772, 866, 1451, 1260, 1329, 9, 145, 55, 65, 8229, 1, 150, 176, 11, 570, 22, 8, 150, 558, 58, 5, 58, 14, 58, 14, 15, 58, 14, 2861, 6494, 22390, 15, 7537, 106, 2824, 24, 5, 1347, 61, 1247, 1, 10481, 2, 20743, 627, 4, 1777, 176, 5, 35, 9863, 254, 28, 280, 2, 1806, 28, 142, 551, 2266, 415, 22, 4686, 4, 31, 1408, 2, 351, 504, 1859, 679, 95, 4, 3357, 5, 3, 154, 2, 64, 61, 1247, 224, 77, 93, 31, 273, 28, 280, 415, 802, 17, 31, 1408, 16, 831, 6, 679, 279, 547, 28, 142, 17219, 415, 1, 10481, 2, 20743, 192, 10, 204, 6, 2559, 4, 8, 1806, 1708, 5, 679, 798, 10481, 2, 20743, 1247, 28, 1806, 61, 97, 3315, 3, 55, 1, 1044, 18, 418, 18, 2, 501, 1458, 84, 44, 3, 9863, 1247, 26, 45, 2536, 2640, 17, 18, 15, 80, 4401, 183, 122, 2559, 48526, 15, 4240, 8365, 7481, 1, 899, 2716, 1286, 9, 913, 2, 2450, 123, 1, 2013, 1628, 4, 3, 1067, 1, 12, 1070]",,21382956,370

Combination of pet imaging with viral vectors for identification of cancer metastases.,Advanced drug delivery reviews,Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev.,2011-04-30,"There are three main ways for dissemination of solid tumors: direct invasion, lymphatic spread and hematogenic spread. The presence of metastases is the most significant factor in predicting prognosis and therefore evidence of metastases will influence decision-making regarding treatment. Conventional imaging techniques are limited in the evaluation and localization of metastases due to their restricted ability to identify subcentimeter neoplastic disease. Hence, there is a need for an effective noninvasive modality that can accurately identify occult metastases in cancer patients. One such method is the combination of positron emission tomography (PET) with vectors designed for delivery of reporter genes into target cells. Vectors expressing the herpes simplex virus-1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk) reporter system have recently been shown to allow localization of micrometastases in animal models of cancer using non invasive imaging. Combination of HSV1-tk and PET imaging is based on the virtues of vectors which can carry and selectively express the HSV1-tk reporter gene in a variety of cancer cells but not in normal tissue. A radioactive tracer which is applied systemically is phosphorylated by the HSV1-tk enzyme, and as a consequence, the tracer accumulates in proportion to the level of HSV1-tk expression which can be imaged by PET. In this paper we review the recent developments in molecular imaging of micrometastases using replication-competent viral or nonviral vectors carrying the HSV1-tk gene using PET imaging. These diagnostic paradigms introduce an advantageous new concept in noninvasive molecular imaging with the potential benefits for improving patient care by providing guidance for therapy to patients with risk for metastases.",Journal Article,3188.0,8.0,There are three main ways for dissemination of solid tumors direct invasion lymphatic spread and hematogenic spread The presence of metastases is the most significant factor in predicting prognosis and therefore evidence of metastases will influence decision-making regarding treatment Conventional imaging techniques are limited in the evaluation and localization of metastases due to their restricted ability to identify subcentimeter neoplastic disease Hence there is a need for an effective noninvasive modality that can accurately identify occult metastases in cancer patients One such method is the combination of positron emission tomography PET with vectors designed for delivery of reporter genes into target cells Vectors expressing the herpes simplex virus-1 thymidine kinase HSV1-tk reporter system have recently been shown to allow localization of micrometastases in animal models of cancer using non invasive imaging Combination of HSV1-tk and PET imaging is based on the virtues of vectors which can carry and selectively express the HSV1-tk reporter gene in a variety of cancer cells but not in normal tissue A radioactive tracer which is applied systemically is phosphorylated by the HSV1-tk enzyme and as a consequence the tracer accumulates in proportion to the level of HSV1-tk expression which can be imaged by PET In this paper we review the recent developments in molecular imaging of micrometastases using replication-competent viral or nonviral vectors carrying the HSV1-tk gene using PET imaging These diagnostic paradigms introduce an advantageous new concept in noninvasive molecular imaging with the potential benefits for improving patient care by providing guidance for therapy to patients with risk for metastases,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[125, 32, 169, 1895, 4245, 9, 3430, 1, 537, 57, 1196, 578, 2936, 2579, 2, 76677, 2579, 3, 463, 1, 196, 16, 3, 96, 93, 161, 4, 1434, 356, 2, 673, 241, 1, 196, 303, 1054, 948, 1079, 666, 24, 809, 270, 1092, 32, 383, 4, 3, 451, 2, 2145, 1, 196, 520, 6, 136, 2016, 801, 6, 255, 16262, 2000, 34, 3665, 125, 16, 8, 594, 9, 35, 323, 2957, 1396, 17, 122, 2141, 255, 2879, 196, 4, 12, 7, 104, 225, 596, 16, 3, 150, 1, 1900, 1799, 872, 495, 5, 5453, 1114, 9, 989, 1, 3674, 214, 237, 283, 37, 5453, 1046, 3, 4716, 7241, 1450, 14, 6403, 216, 20276, 5067, 3674, 398, 47, 761, 85, 443, 6, 1700, 2145, 1, 5485, 4, 2026, 274, 1, 12, 75, 220, 416, 270, 150, 1, 20276, 5067, 2, 495, 270, 16, 90, 23, 3, 35359, 1, 5453, 92, 122, 3542, 2, 2382, 1669, 3, 20276, 5067, 3674, 145, 4, 8, 1362, 1, 12, 37, 84, 44, 4, 295, 246, 8, 4741, 6160, 92, 16, 1498, 6327, 16, 2365, 20, 3, 20276, 5067, 1644, 2, 22, 8, 4177, 3, 6160, 14390, 4, 920, 6, 3, 301, 1, 20276, 5067, 55, 92, 122, 40, 5903, 20, 495, 4, 26, 2817, 21, 206, 3, 435, 3703, 4, 219, 270, 1, 5485, 75, 2079, 6299, 1667, 15, 18434, 5453, 2934, 3, 20276, 5067, 145, 75, 495, 270, 46, 752, 4887, 7630, 35, 10650, 217, 2545, 4, 2957, 219, 270, 5, 3, 174, 1141, 9, 1673, 69, 165, 20, 1736, 2753, 9, 36, 6, 7, 5, 43, 9, 196]",,21565234,108

We reviewed all patients who underwent radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection between 1/2007 and 11/2010. Comparison was made between robotic, laparoscopic and open procedures in regard to surgical times, complication rates, and pathologic findings. A total of 95 radical hysterectomy procedures were performed during the study period: 30 open (RAH), 31 laparoscopic (LRH) and 34 robotic (RRH). There were no differences in age, body mass index or other demographic factors between the groups. Operative time was significantly shorter in the RAH compared to LRH and RRH (265 vs 338 vs 328min, p=0.002). Estimated blood loss was significantly lower in LRH and RRH compared with RAH (100 vs 100 vs 350mL, p<0.001). Thirteen (24%) of RAH required blood transfusion. Conversion rates were higher in the LRH (16%) compared to RRH (3%) although not significant (p=0.10). Median length of stay was significantly shorter in RRH (1day) vs LRH or RAH (2 vs 4days, p<0.01). Pathologic findings were similar among all groups.

Frailty: an outcome predictor for elderly gynecologic oncology patients.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2012-04-19,"The objective of this pilot study was to determine if frailty predicts surgical complications among elderly women undergoing gynecologic oncology procedures. A cohort of gynecologic oncology patients age ≥ 65, undergoing surgery between March and December 2011 was identified. Frailty was evaluated using a validated assessment tool. The primary outcome measure was 30 day postoperative complication rate. Forty women were approached for study entry and 37 (92%) enrolled. The mean age was 73 years (range 65-95). The majority of women had a malignancy and underwent a major abdominal surgical procedure. Twenty-one women (57%) were not frail, 10 (27%) were intermediately frail and 6 (16%) were frail. There was no difference in age or prevalence of medical comorbidities between groups. Frail women had a significantly higher BMI compared to intermediately frail and not frail women, (36.0, 31.5 and 26.1 kg/m(2), p=0.02). The rate of 30-day surgical complications increased with frailty score and was 24%, versus 67% for women who were not frail as compared to the frail (p=0.04). Pre-operative frailty assessment is well accepted by gynecologic oncology patients and feasible in a clinic setting. Frail women had a higher BMI, indicating that low body weight is not a marker for frailty, and had a significantly higher rate of 30-day postoperative complications in this pilot study.

This was a prospective, single-arm pilot study. Eligible participants included those scheduled for a laparotomy for presumed or known gynecologic malignancy. Patients completed a Web-based ""STAR"" (Symptom Tracking and Reporting for Patients) questionnaire once preoperatively and weekly during the 6-week postoperative period. The questionnaire consisted of the patient adaptation of the NCI CTCAE 3.0 and EORTC QLQ-C30 3.0. When a patient submitted a response that was concerning, an automated email alert was sent to the clinician. The patient's assessment of STAR's usefulness was measured via an exit survey. Forty-nine patients completed the study. The procedures included the following: hysterectomy±staging (67%), resection of tumor (22%), salpingo-oophorectomy (6%), and other (4%). Most patients (82%) completed at least 4 sessions in STAR. The CTC generated 43 alerts. These alerts resulted in 25 telephone contacts with patients, 2 ER referrals, one new appointment, and one pharmaceutical prescription. The 3 most common patient-reported symptoms generating an alert were as follows: poor performance status (19%), nausea (18%), and fatigue (17%). Most patients found STAR useful (80%) and would recommend it to others (85%).

Inhibitory effect of genistein on the invasive potential of human cervical cancer cells via modulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase-1 expression.,Cancer epidemiology,Cancer Epidemiol,2012-08-11,"One of the most challenging stumbling blocks for the treatment of cancer is the ability of cancer cells to break the natural barriers and spread from its site of origin to non-adjacent regional and distant sites, accounting for high cancer mortality rates. Gamut experimental and epidemiological data advocate the use of pharmacological or nutritional interventions to inhibit or delay various stage(s) of cancer such as invasion and metastasis. Genistein, a promising chemopreventive agent, has gained considerable attention for its powerful anti-carcinogenic, anti-angiogenic and chemosensitizing activities. In this study, the cytotoxic potential of genistein on HeLa cells by cell viability assay and the mode of cell death induced by genistein were determined by nuclear morphological examination, DNA laddering assay and cell cycle analysis. Moreover, to establish its inhibitory effect on migration of HeLa cells, scratch wound assay was performed and these results were correlated with the expression of genes involved in invasion and migration (MMP-9 and TIMP-1) by RT-PCR. The exposure of HeLa cells to genistein resulted in significant dose- and time-dependent growth inhibition, which was found to be mediated by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M phase. In addition, it induced migration-inhibition in a time-dependent manner by modulating the expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1. Our results signify that genistein may be an effective anti-neoplastic agent to prevent cancer cell growth and invasion and metastasis. Therefore therapeutic strategies utilizing genistein could be developed to substantially reduce cancer morbidity and mortality.",Journal Article,2719.0,37.0,One of the most challenging stumbling blocks for the treatment of cancer is the ability of cancer cells to break the natural barriers and spread from its site of origin to non-adjacent regional and distant sites accounting for high cancer mortality rates Gamut experimental and epidemiological data advocate the use of pharmacological or nutritional interventions to inhibit or delay various stage s of cancer such as invasion and metastasis Genistein a promising chemopreventive agent has gained considerable attention for its powerful anti-carcinogenic anti-angiogenic and chemosensitizing activities In this study the cytotoxic potential of genistein on HeLa cells by cell viability assay and the mode of cell death induced by genistein were determined by nuclear morphological examination DNA laddering assay and cell cycle analysis Moreover to establish its inhibitory effect on migration of HeLa cells scratch wound assay was performed and these results were correlated with the expression of genes involved in invasion and migration MMP-9 and TIMP-1 by RT-PCR The exposure of HeLa cells to genistein resulted in significant dose- and time-dependent growth inhibition which was found to be mediated by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G 2 /M phase In addition it induced migration-inhibition in a time-dependent manner by modulating the expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 Our results signify that genistein may be an effective anti-neoplastic agent to prevent cancer cell growth and invasion and metastasis Therefore therapeutic strategies utilizing genistein could be developed to substantially reduce cancer morbidity and mortality,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[104, 1, 3, 96, 1950, 37449, 2860, 9, 3, 24, 1, 12, 16, 3, 801, 1, 12, 37, 6, 4338, 3, 1504, 2160, 2, 2579, 29, 211, 606, 1, 1938, 6, 220, 2086, 951, 2, 626, 633, 3116, 9, 64, 12, 282, 151, 31244, 1560, 2, 4614, 74, 8912, 3, 119, 1, 3419, 15, 5082, 1151, 6, 1433, 15, 1984, 747, 82, 695, 1, 12, 225, 22, 578, 2, 278, 7395, 8, 721, 4401, 420, 71, 3711, 2658, 2111, 9, 211, 3757, 312, 7483, 312, 2068, 2, 16829, 2042, 4, 26, 45, 3, 759, 174, 1, 7395, 23, 8466, 37, 20, 31, 2120, 719, 2, 3, 4530, 1, 31, 273, 277, 20, 7395, 11, 509, 20, 928, 4268, 1385, 261, 33768, 719, 2, 31, 417, 65, 1393, 6, 1811, 211, 1810, 254, 23, 1381, 1, 8466, 37, 18385, 2689, 719, 10, 173, 2, 46, 99, 11, 438, 5, 3, 55, 1, 214, 646, 4, 578, 2, 1381, 2151, 83, 2, 5272, 14, 20, 240, 604, 3, 645, 1, 8466, 37, 6, 7395, 627, 4, 93, 61, 2, 98, 470, 129, 297, 92, 10, 204, 6, 40, 517, 20, 351, 2, 31, 417, 1854, 28, 499, 18, 188, 124, 4, 352, 192, 277, 1381, 297, 4, 8, 98, 470, 1708, 20, 3712, 3, 55, 1, 2151, 83, 2, 5272, 14, 114, 99, 19016, 17, 7395, 68, 40, 35, 323, 312, 2000, 420, 6, 1682, 12, 31, 129, 2, 578, 2, 278, 673, 189, 422, 2600, 7395, 359, 40, 276, 6, 2109, 969, 12, 787, 2, 282]",,22884883,663

Feasibility of adjuvant chemotherapy after pelvic exenteration for gynecologic malignancies.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2013-06-01,"It is well documented that recurrence after pelvic exenteration remains high (up to 50%), and patients may require a prolonged period of recuperation following this aggressive surgery. We conducted a retrospective review to evaluate the feasibility of administering adjuvant chemotherapy after pelvic exenteration for gynecologic malignancies. We reviewed the medical records of patients with any gynecologic cancer who underwent exenterative surgery between January 2005 and February 2011 at our institution. Patients were referred for postexenteration adjuvant chemotherapy based on surgeon's discretion and/or presence of high-risk features: positive margins, positive lymph nodes, and/or lymphovascular space invasion. Suitability for chemotherapy was assessed by a gynecologic medical oncologist. Regimens consisted of 4 to 6 cycles of platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. Chemotherapy-related toxicities were assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4. We identified 42 patients who underwent pelvic exenteration during the study period.

For women with gynecologic malignancies, the survivorship period requires management of several aspects of care. Improved coordination of care between providers that may be addressed with the use of survivorship care plans and should include surveillance recommendations. Providers should conduct a focused evaluation of late and long-term effects of cancer that may continue to effect patients during and after treatment. Opportunities to improve lifestyle behaviors and continue general health maintenance should also be maximized. The survivorship period incorporates the following: prevention of new cancer diagnoses, surveillance for recurrence, assessment and management of side effects from cancer and cancer treatment, and the coordination of care between patients and healthcare providers.

Incidence of trocar site herniation following robotic gynecologic surgery.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2013-08-27,"Trocar site herniation is a recognized complication of minimally invasive surgery, but published data on trocar site herniation after robotic surgery are scarce. We sought to determine the incidence of trocar site herniation in women undergoing robotic surgery for gynecologic disease. A retrospective review of robotic surgeries performed from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2012, was conducted. Postoperative trocar site herniations were identified, along with time to presentation, location of herniation, and management. Patients were excluded if surgery was converted to laparotomy or traditional laparoscopy. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare patients with and without herniation with respect to continuous variables, and Fisher's exact test was used to compare these 2 groups with respect to categorical variables. The study included 500 patients, 3 of whom experienced herniation at a single trocar site. The patients with and without herniation did not differ with respect to age, body mass index, smoking status, medical comorbidities, operating time, or estimated blood loss. All 3 herniations occurred at 12-mm trocar sites. Two herniations occurred at assistant port sites, and 1 occurred at the umbilical camera port site. The median time to herniation was 21 days (range, 8-38 days). One patient required immediate surgical intervention; the other 2 patients had conservative management. Trocar site herniation is a rare complication following robotic surgery.

Two-hundred and eight consecutive patients had spine surgery during this time period and one hundred and fifty-two met inclusion criteria. All patients had SSEP monitoring, with 4 having transient changes and 7 persistent changes. One hundred and twenty-two patients had combined SSEP and MEP monitoring, with 3 having transient changes and 4 persistent changes in MEP signals. Two patients had neurophysiologic changes associated with hypotension and correction led to normalization. One developed new neurologic deficits after surgery. Two from the total cohort had new postoperative neurologic deficits. One had a transient decrease in MEP amplitude while the other had no intraoperative changes.

Referrals to phase I clinical trials in a gynecologic oncology unit.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2013-09-14,"Previous reviews of phase I clinical trials report limited response rates. Development of novel biologic agents and trials designs have increased these rates. A contemporary appraisal of phase I clinical trials in gynecologic malignancies could help validate these findings. Retrospectively reviewed records for 410 patients with gynecologic malignancies treated in a phase I unit, January 1999 to October 2012. Patient characteristics and treatment outcomes were abstracted and analyzed. Patients enrolled in 43 different phase I trials, 17 phase Ia, 17 phase Ib dose escalation and 9 dose expansion. 9 trials (21%) investigated unique cytotoxic delivery methods, 15 (35%) conventional cytotoxic plus novel agents and 19 (44%) novel agents alone. For patients treated in the first-line setting, 90 (74.4%) achieved CR, 20 (16.5%) PR, 9 (7.4%) SD and 2 (1.7%) PD, yielding an overall response rate of 90.9%. In patients treated for recurrent disease, 2 (1.6%) achieved CR, 11 (8.9%) PR, 57 (46.0%) SD and 54 (43.5%) PD, yielding a response rate of 11% and an overall clinical benefit rate of 57%. Response rate for molecular targeted therapies was 11.5% with an overall clinical benefit rate of 46.2%.

Clin. Oncol.,2014-01-06,"This prospective, randomized phase III intergroup trial of the Gynecologic Oncology Group and National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group was designed to test the effectiveness and safety of adding the hypoxic cell sensitizer tirapazamine (TPZ) to standard cisplatin (CIS) chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced cervix cancer. Patients with locally advanced cervix cancer were randomly assigned to CIS chemoradiotherapy versus CIS/TPZ chemoradiotherapy. Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival (OS) and tolerability. PFS was evaluable in 387 of 402 patients randomly assigned over 36 months, with enrollment ending in September 2009. Because of the lack of TPZ supply, the study did not reach its original target accrual goal. At median follow-up of 28.3 months, PFS and OS were similar in both arms. Three-year PFS for the TPZ/CIS/RT and CIS/RT arms were 63.0% and 64.4%, respectively (log-rank P = .7869). Three-year OS for the TPZ/CIS/RT and CIS/RT arms were 70.5% and 70.6%, respectively (log-rank P = .8333).

Dosimetric predictors of duodenal toxicity after intensity modulated radiation therapy for treatment of the para-aortic nodes in gynecologic cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2014-02-01,"To determine the incidence of duodenal toxicity in patients receiving intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for treatment of para-aortic nodes and to identify dosimetric parameters predictive of late duodenal toxicity. We identified 105 eligible patients with gynecologic malignancies who were treated with IMRT for gross metastatic disease in the para-aortic nodes from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2009. Patients were treated to a nodal clinical target volume to 45 to 50.4 Gy with a boost to 60 to 66 Gy. The duodenum was contoured, and dosimetric data were exported for analysis. Duodenal toxicity was scored according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. Univariate Cox proportional hazards analysis and recursive partitioning analysis were used to determine associations between dosimetric variables and time to toxicity and to identify the optimal threshold that separated patients according to risk of toxicity. Nine of the 105 patients experienced grade 2 to grade 5 duodenal toxicity, confirmed by endoscopy in all cases. The 3-year actuarial rate of any duodenal toxicity was 11.7%. A larger volume of the duodenum receiving 55 Gy (V55) was associated with higher rates of duodenal toxicity. The 3-year actuarial rates of duodenal toxicity with V55 above and below 15 cm(3) were 48.6% and 7.4%, respectively (P<.01). In Cox univariate analysis of dosimetric variables, V55 was associated with duodenal toxicity (P=.029). In recursive partitioning analysis, V55 less than 13.94% segregated all patients with duodenal toxicity. Dose-escalated IMRT can safely and effectively treat para-aortic nodal disease in gynecologic malignancies, provided that care is taken to limit the dose to the duodenum to reduce the risk of late duodenal toxicity. Limiting V55 to below 15 cm(3) may reduce the risk of duodenal complications. In cases where the treatment cannot be delivered within these constraints, consideration should be given to other treatment approaches such as resection or initial chemotherapy.",Journal Article,2180.0,29.0,To determine the incidence of duodenal toxicity in patients receiving intensity modulated radiation therapy IMRT for treatment of para-aortic nodes and to identify dosimetric parameters predictive of late duodenal toxicity We identified 105 eligible patients with gynecologic malignancies who were treated with IMRT for gross metastatic disease in the para-aortic nodes from January 1 2005 through December 31 2009 Patients were treated to a nodal clinical target volume to 45 to 50.4 Gy with a boost to 60 to 66 Gy The duodenum was contoured and dosimetric data were exported for analysis Duodenal toxicity was scored according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria Univariate Cox proportional hazards analysis and recursive partitioning analysis were used to determine associations between dosimetric variables and time to toxicity and to identify the optimal threshold that separated patients according to risk of toxicity Nine of the 105 patients experienced grade 2 to grade 5 duodenal toxicity confirmed by endoscopy in all cases The 3-year actuarial rate of any duodenal toxicity was 11.7 A larger volume of the duodenum receiving 55 Gy V55 was associated with higher rates of duodenal toxicity The 3-year actuarial rates of duodenal toxicity with V55 above and below 15 cm 3 were 48.6 and 7.4 respectively P .01 In Cox univariate analysis of dosimetric variables V55 was associated with duodenal toxicity P=.029 In recursive partitioning analysis V55 less than 13.94 segregated all patients with duodenal toxicity Dose-escalated IMRT can safely and effectively treat para-aortic nodal disease in gynecologic malignancies provided that care is taken to limit the dose to the duodenum to reduce the risk of late duodenal toxicity Limiting V55 to below 15 cm 3 may reduce the risk of duodenal complications In cases where the treatment can not be delivered within these constraints consideration should be given to other treatment approaches such as resection or initial chemotherapy,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[6, 223, 3, 287, 1, 4748, 155, 4, 7, 357, 837, 1757, 121, 36, 964, 9, 24, 1, 4615, 3938, 502, 2, 6, 255, 3187, 1038, 464, 1, 807, 4748, 155, 21, 108, 3263, 625, 7, 5, 1512, 441, 54, 11, 73, 5, 964, 9, 1789, 113, 34, 4, 3, 4615, 3938, 502, 29, 1024, 14, 1242, 298, 1397, 456, 1238, 7, 11, 73, 6, 8, 779, 38, 283, 433, 6, 512, 6, 212, 39, 381, 5, 8, 2569, 6, 335, 6, 700, 381, 3, 8401, 10, 6476, 2, 3187, 74, 11, 16961, 9, 65, 4748, 155, 10, 3179, 768, 6, 121, 36, 413, 87, 371, 880, 418, 831, 1017, 65, 2, 4493, 4515, 65, 11, 95, 6, 223, 685, 59, 3187, 682, 2, 98, 6, 155, 2, 6, 255, 3, 665, 2390, 17, 4910, 7, 768, 6, 43, 1, 155, 762, 1, 3, 3263, 7, 592, 88, 18, 6, 88, 33, 4748, 155, 557, 20, 4199, 4, 62, 140, 3, 27, 111, 2361, 116, 1, 500, 4748, 155, 10, 175, 67, 8, 1077, 433, 1, 3, 8401, 357, 614, 381, 29521, 10, 41, 5, 142, 151, 1, 4748, 155, 3, 27, 111, 2361, 151, 1, 4748, 155, 5, 29521, 2090, 2, 2736, 167, 494, 27, 11, 576, 49, 2, 67, 39, 106, 19, 355, 4, 418, 880, 65, 1, 3187, 682, 29521, 10, 41, 5, 4748, 155, 19, 4770, 4, 4493, 4515, 65, 29521, 299, 76, 233, 960, 11324, 62, 7, 5, 4748, 155, 61, 2842, 964, 122, 2268, 2, 1856, 943, 4615, 3938, 779, 34, 4, 1512, 441, 1052, 17, 165, 16, 1633, 6, 2385, 3, 61, 6, 3, 8401, 6, 969, 3, 43, 1, 807, 4748, 155, 817, 29521, 6, 2736, 167, 494, 27, 68, 969, 3, 43, 1, 4748, 521, 4, 140, 1257, 3, 24, 122, 44, 40, 1623, 262, 46, 4879, 2415, 257, 40, 447, 6, 127, 24, 611, 225, 22, 170, 15, 388, 56]",,24411609,317

HPV vaccine use among African American girls: qualitative formative research using a participatory social marketing approach.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2014-01-31,"To generate recommendations for framing messages to promote HPV vaccination, specifically for African American adolescents and their parents who have not yet made a decision about the vaccine (the ""Undecided"" market segment). Focus groups and interviews were conducted with African American girls ages 11-18 (N=34) and their mothers (N=31), broken into market segments based on daughter's vaccination status and mother's intent to vaccinate. Findings suggested that the HPV vaccine should be presented to ""Undecided"" mothers and adolescents as a routine vaccine (just like other vaccines) that helps prevent cancer. Within the ""Undecided"" segment, we identified two sub-segments based on barriers to HPV vaccination and degree of reluctance. The ""Undecided/Ready If Offered"" segment would easily accept HPV vaccine if given the opportunity, with basic information and a healthcare provider recommendation. The ""Undecided/Skeptical"" segment would need more in-depth information to allay concerns about vaccine safety, mistrust of drug companies, and recommended age. Some mothers and girls had the erroneous perception that girls do not need the vaccine until they become sexually active. African American adolescents and their mothers overwhelmingly thought campaigns should target both girls and boys for HPV vaccination.

Eligible, consenting patients received pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) and cisplatin 50 mg/m(2) intravenously repeated every 21 days until disease progression or adverse events prohibited further therapy. Patients received no prior therapeutic chemotherapy, except when administered concurrently with primary radiation therapy. Subsequent doses were adjusted according to observed toxicity and protocol guidelines. Adverse events were assessed with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 3.0. The primary measure of efficacy was tumor response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. The study was stratified by prior radiation therapy. From September 2008 to November 2011, 55 patients were enrolled by five Gynecologic Oncology Group member institutions; of those, 54 patients were eligible and assessable.

This was a single institutional retrospective review. Gynecologic oncology patients with a documented history of mild or low-risk, moderate immediate HSRs to carboplatin/cisplatin and continued treatment with 4-step, one-solution desensitization protocols in the outpatient infusion center were included. Patients with delayed HSRs or immediate high-risk, moderate or severe HSRs were excluded. The primary end point was the rate of successful administrations of each course of platinums. From January 2011 to June 2013, eighteen eligible patients were evaluated for outpatient 4-step, one-solution desensitization. Thirteen patients had a history of HSRs to carboplatin and 5 with HSRs to cisplatin. All of 18 patients successfully completed 94 (98.9%) of 95 desensitization courses in the outpatient infusion center. Eight of 8 (100%) patients with initial mild HSRs completed 29/29 (100%) desensitization courses, and 9 of 10 (90%) of patients with initial moderate HSRs completed 65/66 (94%) desensitization courses. In total, 65/95 (68%) desensitizations resulted in no breakthrough reactions, and mild, moderate and severe breakthrough reactions were seen in 19%, 12% and 1% desensitizations, respectively.

[18F]-Fluoromisonidazole positron emission tomography/computed tomography visualization of tumor hypoxia in patients with chordoma of the mobile and sacrococcygeal spine.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2014-12-01,"To investigate [18F]-fluoromisonidazole positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FMISO-PET/CT) detection of targetable hypoxic subvolumes (HSVs) in chordoma of the mobile or sacrococcygeal spine. A prospective, pilot study of 20 patients with primary or locally recurrent chordoma of the mobile or sacrococcygeal spine treated with proton or combined proton/photon radiation therapy (RT) with or without surgery was completed. The FMISO-PET/CT was performed before RT and after 19.8-34.2 GyRBE (relative biologic effectiveness). Gross tumor volumes were delineated and HSVs defined including voxels with standardized uptake values ≥1.4 times the muscle mean. Clinical characteristics and treatments received were compared between patients with and without HSVs. The FMISO-PET/CT detected HSVs in 12 of 20 patients (60%). Baseline and interval HSV spatial concordance varied (0%-94%). Eight HSVs were sufficiently large (≥5 cm(3)) to potentially allow an intensity modulated proton therapy boost. Patients with HSVs had significantly larger gross tumor volumes (median 410.0 cm(3) vs 63.4 cm(3); P=.02) and were significantly more likely to have stage T2 tumors (5 of 12 vs 0 of 8; P=.04). After a median follow-up of 1.8 years (range, 0.2-4.4 years), a local recurrence has yet to be observed. Three patients developed metastatic disease, 2 with HSVs.

Gynecologic Oncologist as surgical consultant: intraoperative consultations during general gynecologic surgery as an important focus of gynecologic oncology training.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2015-01-21,"The aim of this study is to explore the previously unexamined role of the Gynecologic Oncologist as an intraoperative consultant during general gynecologic surgery. Demographic and clinical data were collected on 98 major gynecologic surgeries that included both a general Gynecologist and a Gynecologic Oncologist between October 2010 and August 2014. Data were analyzed using XLSTAT-Prov2014.2.02. Of 794 major gynecologic surgeries, 98 (12.3%) cases that involved an intraoperative consultation were identified. There were 36 (37%) planned consults and 62 (63%) unplanned consults. Significantly more planned consults were during laparoscopy (100% v 58%; p<0.01) and significantly more unplanned consults were during laparotomy (42% v 0%; p<0.01). The majority of planned consults were for surgical training (86%) and the most common reasons for unplanned consults were adhesions (40%), bowel injury (19%), inability to identify ureter (19%), and cancer (11%). The most common interventions performed during unplanned consults were identification of anatomy (55%), lysis of adhesions (42%), and retroperitoneal dissection (27%). Average surgeon years in practice were significantly lower for unplanned consults (9 v 15; p<0.01). A total of 25 major adverse events occurred in 15 cases with the majority occurring in cases with unplanned consults (23% v 3%; p<0.01). After controlling for laparotomy, unplanned consultation was not significantly associated with major events (OR=6.67, 95%CI 0.69-64.39; p=0.10).

Abstracted data included demographics, dates of surgery, operative details, cancer history, and relevant medical history. The readmitted patients (n = 166) were compared with randomly selected controls (n = 168) from the same service in a matching time frame and analyzed using univariate and multivariate models. In the study period, 2993 operations were performed. One hundred sixty-six unique patients (5.5%) were readmitted within 30 days of discharge from their operative procedure. On multivariate analysis, the factors that were associated with a higher risk of readmission were a history of psychiatric disease, postoperative complication, type of insurance, surgical modality, and lysis of adhesions at the time of surgery. The most common readmission diagnoses were infection (44%), nausea/vomiting (28%), thrombosis (6%), bowel leak (4%), and bleeding (4%). Postoperative readmissions are a common problem and are increasingly important as a measure of quality.

Cyclometalated Ruthenium(II) Anthraquinone Complexes Exhibit Strong Anticancer Activity in Hypoxic Tumor Cells.,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",Chemistry,2015-09-04,"Hypoxia is the critical feature of the tumor microenvironment that is known to lead to resistance to many chemotherapeutic drugs. Six novel ruthenium(II) anthraquinone complexes were designed and synthesized; they exhibit similar or superior cytotoxicity compared to cisplatin in hypoxic HeLa, A549, and multidrug-resistant (A549R) tumor cell lines. Their anticancer activities are related to their lipophilicity and cellular uptake; therefore, these physicochemical properties of the complexes can be changed by modifying the ligands to obtain better anticancer candidates.

Safety and Local Control of Radiation Therapy for Chordoma of the Spine and Sacrum: A Systematic Review.,Spine,Spine,2016-10-01,"Systematic literature review. To assess the toxicity, common radiation doses, and local control (LC) rates of radiation therapy for chordoma of the spine and sacrum and identify the difference in LC and toxicity between adjuvant, salvage, and primary therapy using radiation. Chordoma of the spine is typically a low-grade malignant tumor thought to be relatively radioresistant with a high rate of local recurrence and the potential for metastases. Improved results of modern radiation therapy in the treatment of chordoma support exploration of its role in the management of primary/de novo chordoma or recurrent chordoma. We conducted a systematic literature review using PubMed and Embase databases to assess information available regarding the toxicity, LC rates, and overall survival (OS) rates for adjuvant, salvage, and primary radiation therapy for spinal and sacral chordoma. A total of 40 articles were reviewed. Evidence quality was low or very low. The highest rates of LC and OS were with early adjuvant RT for primary/de novo disease.

High-Risk Human Papillomavirus E7 Alters Host DNA Methylome and Represses HLA-E Expression in Human Keratinocytes.,Scientific reports,Sci Rep,2017-06-16,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection distinctly alters methylation patterns in HPV-associated cancer. We have recently reported that HPV E7-dependent promoter hypermethylation leads to downregulation of the chemokine CXCL14 and suppression of antitumor immune responses. To investigate the extent of gene expression dysregulated by HPV E7-induced DNA methylation, we analyzed parallel global gene expression and DNA methylation using normal immortalized keratinocyte lines, NIKS, NIKS-16, NIKS-18, and NIKS-16∆E7. We show that expression of the MHC class I genes is downregulated in HPV-positive keratinocytes in an E7-dependent manner. Methylome analysis revealed hypermethylation at a distal CpG island (CGI) near the HLA-E gene in NIKS-16 cells compared to either NIKS cells or NIKS-16∆E7 cells, which lack E7 expression. The HLA-E CGI functions as an active promoter element which is dramatically repressed by DNA methylation. HLA-E protein expression on cell surface is downregulated by high-risk HPV16 and HPV18 E7 expression, but not by low-risk HPV6 and HPV11 E7 expression. Conversely, demethylation at the HLA-E CGI restores HLA-E protein expression in HPV-positive keratinocytes. Because HLA-E plays an important role in antiviral immunity by regulating natural killer and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, epigenetic downregulation of HLA-E by high-risk HPV E7 may contribute to virus-induced immune evasion during HPV persistence.",Journal Article,949.0,15.0,Human papillomavirus HPV infection distinctly alters methylation patterns in HPV-associated cancer We have recently reported that HPV E7-dependent promoter hypermethylation leads to downregulation of the chemokine CXCL14 and suppression of antitumor immune responses To investigate the extent of gene expression dysregulated by HPV E7-induced DNA methylation we analyzed parallel global gene expression and DNA methylation using normal immortalized keratinocyte lines NIKS NIKS-16 NIKS-18 and NIKS-16∆E7 We show that expression of the MHC class I genes is downregulated in HPV-positive keratinocytes in an E7-dependent manner Methylome analysis revealed hypermethylation at a distal CpG island CGI near the HLA-E gene in NIKS-16 cells compared to either NIKS cells or NIKS-16∆E7 cells which lack E7 expression The HLA-E CGI functions as an active promoter element which is dramatically repressed by DNA methylation HLA-E protein expression on cell surface is downregulated by high-risk HPV16 and HPV18 E7 expression but not by low-risk HPV6 and HPV11 E7 expression Conversely demethylation at the HLA-E CGI restores HLA-E protein expression in HPV-positive keratinocytes Because HLA-E plays an important role in antiviral immunity by regulating natural killer and CD8 sup /sup T cells epigenetic downregulation of HLA-E by high-risk HPV E7 may contribute to virus-induced immune evasion during HPV persistence,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[171, 3242, 933, 930, 9452, 6745, 569, 764, 4, 933, 41, 12, 21, 47, 761, 210, 17, 933, 4540, 470, 973, 2575, 1940, 6, 2475, 1, 3, 3596, 18390, 2, 1332, 1, 579, 250, 253, 6, 963, 3, 1039, 1, 145, 55, 4288, 20, 933, 4540, 277, 261, 569, 21, 311, 2755, 1648, 145, 55, 2, 261, 569, 75, 295, 6090, 14065, 285, 27814, 27814, 245, 27814, 203, 2, 27814, 52478, 21, 514, 17, 55, 1, 3, 3658, 1040, 70, 214, 16, 3315, 4, 933, 109, 9587, 4, 35, 4540, 470, 1708, 11362, 65, 553, 2575, 28, 8, 2107, 2075, 3454, 18180, 1829, 3, 1160, 563, 145, 4, 27814, 245, 37, 72, 6, 361, 27814, 37, 15, 27814, 52478, 37, 92, 926, 4540, 55, 3, 1160, 563, 18180, 1681, 22, 35, 544, 973, 4467, 92, 16, 2729, 6654, 20, 261, 569, 1160, 563, 178, 55, 23, 31, 1255, 16, 3315, 20, 64, 43, 4048, 2, 33514, 4540, 55, 84, 44, 20, 154, 43, 41407, 2, 78976, 4540, 55, 3154, 6800, 28, 3, 1160, 563, 18180, 8489, 1160, 563, 178, 55, 4, 933, 109, 9587, 408, 1160, 563, 1698, 35, 305, 200, 4, 6264, 1604, 20, 2681, 1504, 3458, 2, 968, 172, 172, 102, 37, 1418, 2475, 1, 1160, 563, 20, 64, 43, 933, 4540, 68, 1248, 6, 1450, 277, 250, 5351, 190, 933, 4108]",,28623356,548

TES approaches vary in both the number of stages to complete the procedure and instruments with which osteotomies are performed. We describe a 2-stage technique that employs the use of threadwire saws. We performed a retrospective review of cases of primary tumors and solitary metastases involving the thoracic or lumbar spine treated with use of our modified technique at our institution between 2010 and 2016, identifying eligible patients by searching for specific phrases in operative reports found in our oncologic database. Clinical notes, operative notes, imaging reports, and pathology reports were reviewed for all patients. Thirty-three patients underwent our modified technique, in which we pass a threadwire saw between the vertebral body and the thecal sac. The most common tumor type was chordoma (64%), and tumors were most commonly located in the lumbar spine (61%). There were no intraoperative injuries to the spinal cord or great vessels. One patient experienced a dural tear secondary to the passage of a saw. Seventeen (52%) of the patients had perioperative complications, with 1 death. Seven (22%) of the patients had complications occurring within 90 days after discharge, and 8 (25%) had complications occurring >90 days after discharge. Instrumentation failure was observed in 8 cases (25%). Negative margins were obtained in 94% of the cases. Local recurrence was observed in 2 cases (6%). The majority of patients had normal motor function at the time of the most recent follow-up.

Postoperative Complications Drive Unplanned Readmissions After Esophagectomy for Cancer.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2018-01-31,"Hospital readmissions are increasingly viewed as a marker of inferior health care quality and penalized with decreased reimbursement. The timing of, and reasons for, readmissions after esophagectomy for cancer are not well understood. We examined the association of complications to 30-day postoperative-related, unplanned readmission to identify opportunities for improvement in patient care. We analyzed the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (2012 to 2015) to characterize 30-day postoperative unplanned readmissions after esophagectomy for cancer using descriptive statistics. Type and timing of readmission after discharge was assessed. A Cox proportional hazards model was developed to identify predictors of readmission. Of 3,723 patients who underwent esophagectomy for cancer, 1,419 (38.1%) experienced ≥1 complication within 30 days. A total of 400 patients (10.7%) experienced related, unplanned readmissions within 30 days of the operation, and postoperative complications were documented in 263 (65.8%). Leading causes of readmission were infectious, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal complications. Of these patients, 155 (59%) were readmitted within 7 days and 236 (90%) within 14 days of discharge.

Consideration of older patients for enrollment in phase 1 clinical trials: Exploring treatment related toxicities and outcomes.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol.

Older patients are underrepresented in primary treatment trials, but little is known about their ability to withstand trial-based treatment for recurrent or refractory disease. This study sought to examine treatment-related toxicities and outcomes of older versus younger patients participating in phase 1 clinical trials. A retrospective analysis of patients enrolled in phase 1 clinical trials for gynecologic malignancies from 2010 to 2016 was performed. Demographic and clinic-pathologic data was abstracted. Toxicities were defined as either grade III or IV by CTCAE criteria. Best response was calculated using RECIST criteria. Associations between categorical variables were determined using Fisher's exact test and continuous variables using Wilcoxon rank sum test. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 237 patients were included with 22% (n=51) comprising the older cohort (≥70years). The vast majority (98%) were treated for recurrent disease. Older patients incurred similar grade III/IV hematologic (21% vs 16%, p=0.38) and non-hematologic toxicities (26% vs 29%, p=0.64). Older patients discontinued treatment due to toxicity only 8% of the time. Median survival was 13.0 and 10.3months in the <70 and ≥70 groups, respectively (p=0.35). 63% of patients ≥70 achieved clinical benefit. Although historically older patients have not been routinely considered for enrollment in phase 1 trials, our data demonstrates similar toxicity profiles to that of younger patients and 63% clinical benefit rate.

Mutation allele frequency threshold does not affect prognostic analysis using next-generation sequencing in oral squamous cell carcinoma.,BMC cancer,BMC Cancer,2018-07-24,"With the development of sequencing technologies, there may be some disputes on sequencing analysis. The aim of this study was to investigate different allele frequency thresholds of mutations in targeted genes on prognostic analyses using a panel of cancer associated gene exons (CAGE) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Forty-six patients were included in this study. Twelve genes were sequenced and analyzed using next-generation sequencing from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Allele frequency thresholds of 10, 5, and 3% were used for prognostic analyses. With a mean sequence depth of 3199-fold, 99% of CAGE were represented by at least 10 reads. Ninety-four non-synonymous (missense [70.2%], nonsense [11.7%], splice site [10.6%], and insertion/deletion [7.5%]) mutations were detected in 40 OSCC patients with an allele frequency threshold of 10%. TP53 (78.3%), NOTCH1 (30.4%), CASP8 (13.0%), CDKN2A (10.9%), and CDH1 (6.5%) were the most frequently mutated genes.

Mucosal HPV E6/E7 Peptide Vaccination in Combination with Immune Checkpoint Modulation Induces Regression of HPV<sup>+</sup> Oral Cancers.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2018-07-27,"High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx (SCCOP) are among the fastest growing cancers. After standard-of-care treatment, however, patients with HPV<sup>+</sup> SCCOP have better overall and disease-specific survival than patients with HPV<sup>-</sup> SCCOP, suggesting the importance of HPV-specific immunity. We reasoned that therapeutic vaccination targeting the HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncogenes could elicit high-affinity, high-frequency tumor antigen-specific T-cell responses, which could then be augmented and shielded from suppression in the tumor microenvironment by immune checkpoint modulation. In this study, we used a preclinical syngeneic mouse model of oral cancer comprised of mouse tonsil-derived epithelial cells stably expressing HPV-16 E6 and E7 genes along with H-ras oncogene (mEER) to identify combinations of vaccination and checkpoint antibodies capable of promoting tumor regression. Intranasal HPV E6/E7 peptide vaccination and single checkpoint antibodies failed to elicit responses in more than half of animals; however, 4-1BB agonist antibody along with either CD40 agonist antibody or CTLA-4 blockade eliminated the majority of established mEER tumors. The combination of intranasal HPV peptide vaccine and α4-1BB and αCTLA-4 antibodies produced curative efficacy and a better safety profile against orally implanted mEER tumors. Correlates of protective immunity included enhanced intratumoral levels of CD8 T cells relative to immunosuppressive regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Overall, our results demonstrate combination vaccine-immunotherapy modalities as novel treatment options for HPV<sup>+</sup> SCCOP.<b>Significance:</b> Combinations of vaccine and checkpoint modulation are effective and safe treatment options for HPV<sup>+</sup> oral cancers. <i>Cancer Res; 78(18); 5327-39. ©2018 AACR</i>.",Journal Article,543.0,4.0,High-risk human papillomavirus HPV -associated squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx SCCOP are among the fastest growing cancers After standard-of-care treatment however patients with HPV sup /sup SCCOP have better overall and disease-specific survival than patients with HPV sup /sup SCCOP suggesting the importance of HPV-specific immunity We reasoned that therapeutic vaccination targeting the HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncogenes could elicit high-affinity high-frequency tumor antigen-specific T-cell responses which could then be augmented and shielded from suppression in the tumor microenvironment by immune checkpoint modulation In this study we used a preclinical syngeneic mouse model of oral cancer comprised of mouse tonsil-derived epithelial cells stably expressing HPV-16 E6 and E7 genes along with H-ras oncogene mEER to identify combinations of vaccination and checkpoint antibodies capable of promoting tumor regression Intranasal HPV E6/E7 peptide vaccination and single checkpoint antibodies failed to elicit responses in more than half of animals however 4-1BB agonist antibody along with either CD40 agonist antibody or CTLA-4 blockade eliminated the majority of established mEER tumors The combination of intranasal HPV peptide vaccine and α4-1BB and αCTLA-4 antibodies produced curative efficacy and a better safety profile against orally implanted mEER tumors Correlates of protective immunity included enhanced intratumoral levels of CD8 T cells relative to immunosuppressive regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells Overall our results demonstrate combination vaccine-immunotherapy modalities as novel treatment options for HPV sup /sup SCCOP. b Significance /b Combinations of vaccine and checkpoint modulation are effective and safe treatment options for HPV sup /sup oral cancers i Cancer Res 78 18 5327-39 ©2018 AACR /i,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[64, 43, 171, 3242, 933, 41, 691, 31, 826, 1, 3, 5333, 28796, 32, 107, 3, 18177, 1921, 163, 50, 260, 1, 165, 24, 137, 7, 5, 933, 172, 172, 28796, 47, 380, 63, 2, 34, 112, 25, 76, 7, 5, 933, 172, 172, 28796, 802, 3, 1187, 1, 933, 112, 1604, 21, 15577, 17, 189, 1915, 529, 3, 933, 245, 4837, 2, 4540, 3326, 359, 5487, 64, 3601, 64, 675, 30, 448, 112, 102, 31, 253, 92, 359, 818, 40, 4277, 2, 17327, 29, 1332, 4, 3, 30, 995, 20, 250, 986, 2356, 4, 26, 45, 21, 95, 8, 693, 5174, 830, 202, 1, 518, 12, 2603, 1, 830, 10226, 526, 701, 37, 5834, 1046, 933, 245, 4837, 2, 4540, 214, 1510, 5, 555, 1102, 1836, 42757, 6, 255, 1247, 1, 1915, 2, 986, 890, 2787, 1, 2388, 30, 320, 24906, 933, 4837, 4540, 1389, 1915, 2, 226, 986, 890, 1551, 6, 5487, 253, 4, 80, 76, 1303, 1, 2258, 137, 39, 6521, 3821, 548, 1510, 5, 361, 5040, 3821, 548, 15, 2127, 39, 1189, 6173, 3, 686, 1, 635, 42757, 57, 3, 150, 1, 24906, 933, 1389, 1274, 2, 29153, 6521, 2, 39639, 39, 890, 1687, 1075, 209, 2, 8, 380, 367, 800, 480, 1428, 3416, 42757, 57, 1871, 1, 2864, 1604, 159, 651, 2074, 148, 1, 968, 102, 37, 580, 6, 2989, 1253, 102, 37, 2, 533, 526, 1245, 37, 63, 114, 99, 608, 150, 1274, 726, 1558, 22, 229, 24, 838, 9, 933, 172, 172, 28796, 132, 724, 132, 1247, 1, 1274, 2, 986, 2356, 32, 323, 2, 1165, 24, 838, 9, 933, 172, 172, 518, 163, 70, 12, 1936, 833, 203, 30841, 587, 4281, 1630, 70]",,30054333,10

Smokeless tobacco use and oral neoplasia among urban Indian women.,Oral diseases,Oral Dis,2019-08-19,"Oral cavity cancers are fourth most common cancers among Indian women. The objectives were to create cancer awareness (CA) and screen tobacco-using women for oral cavity cancers. A community-based CA and screening programme was conducted among women in Mumbai, India. The tobacco-using women participated in CA and oral cavity screening by oral visual inspection (OVI). All screen-positive women were referred to nodal hospital and assisted for diagnostic confirmation and treatment completion. Twelve slum clusters comprising of 138,383 population and 13,492 tobacco-using women have been covered. Among them, 11,895 (88.2%) participated in CA and 11,768 (87.2%) in OVI. A total of 377 (3.2%) women were screened positive, 275 (72.9%) complied with referral and 207 oral precancers [173 leukoplakia, 9 erythroplakia, 3 erythroleukoplakia and 41 sub-mucus fibrosis (SMF) including 35 women with multiple precancers] and 7 oral cancers were diagnosed. The detection rate of oral precancerous lesions and oral cancers was 17.6 and 0.6 per 1,000 screened women. Thirty-five women had multiple oral precancerous lesions. The results of multivariate analysis indicate dose-response relationship between tobacco use and risk of oral precancers. Good participation rates (>85%) for cancer awareness and OVI were seen among urban slum women in India. Many oral precancer and cancer cases were detected and were managed at the nodal hospital.",Journal Article,155.0,0.0,"Oral cavity cancers are fourth most common cancers among Indian women The objectives were to create cancer awareness CA and screen tobacco-using women for oral cavity cancers A community-based CA and screening programme was conducted among women in Mumbai India The tobacco-using women participated in CA and oral cavity screening by oral visual inspection OVI All screen-positive women were referred to nodal hospital and assisted for diagnostic confirmation and treatment completion Twelve slum clusters comprising of 138,383 population and 13,492 tobacco-using women have been covered Among them 11,895 88.2 participated in CA and 11,768 87.2 in OVI A total of 377 3.2 women were screened positive 275 72.9 complied with referral and 207 oral precancers 173 leukoplakia 9 erythroplakia 3 erythroleukoplakia and 41 sub-mucus fibrosis SMF including 35 women with multiple precancers and 7 oral cancers were diagnosed The detection rate of oral precancerous lesions and oral cancers was 17.6 and 0.6 per 1,000 screened women Thirty-five women had multiple oral precancerous lesions The results of multivariate analysis indicate dose-response relationship between tobacco use and risk of oral precancers Good participation rates 85 for cancer awareness and OVI were seen among urban slum women in India Many oral precancer and cancer cases were detected and were managed at the nodal hospital",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[518, 2405, 163, 32, 3608, 96, 186, 163, 107, 7968, 117, 3, 2409, 11, 6, 3736, 12, 3310, 1568, 2, 2413, 2607, 75, 117, 9, 518, 2405, 163, 8, 1714, 90, 1568, 2, 453, 11410, 10, 426, 107, 117, 4, 33733, 7776, 3, 2607, 75, 117, 3025, 4, 1568, 2, 518, 2405, 453, 20, 518, 3046, 11746, 42791, 62, 2413, 109, 117, 11, 1995, 6, 779, 702, 2, 2927, 9, 752, 3551, 2, 24, 1438, 2544, 52657, 3780, 3538, 1, 4478, 10574, 266, 2, 233, 11628, 2607, 75, 117, 47, 85, 4306, 107, 1370, 175, 15241, 889, 18, 3025, 4, 1568, 2, 175, 15188, 912, 18, 4, 42791, 8, 181, 1, 8211, 27, 18, 117, 11, 2261, 109, 5620, 720, 83, 26387, 5, 2096, 2, 5292, 518, 18753, 5785, 15359, 83, 80047, 27, 80048, 2, 605, 551, 20605, 3000, 80049, 141, 465, 117, 5, 232, 18753, 2, 67, 518, 163, 11, 265, 3, 638, 116, 1, 518, 6605, 406, 2, 518, 163, 10, 269, 49, 2, 13, 49, 379, 14, 984, 2261, 117, 977, 365, 117, 42, 232, 518, 6605, 406, 3, 99, 1, 331, 65, 1008, 61, 51, 858, 59, 2607, 119, 2, 43, 1, 518, 18753, 1178, 2599, 151, 772, 9, 12, 3310, 2, 42791, 11, 527, 107, 5532, 52657, 117, 4, 7776, 445, 518, 12380, 2, 12, 140, 11, 530, 2, 11, 2231, 28, 3, 779, 702]",,31348589,191
