"A phase II trial of combination chemotherapy and surgical resection for the treatment of metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma: continuous infusion doxorubicin, vincristine, and etoposide with daily mitotane as a P-glycoprotein antagonist.",Cancer,Cancer,2002-05-01,"Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is rare, nearly always fatal, and to the authors' knowledge has few nonsurgical treatment options. Based on in vitro studies demonstrating the efficacy of mitotane as a P-glycoprotein (Pgp) antagonist, and expression of high levels of Pgp in ACC, the authors conducted a study of infusional doxorubicin, vincristine, and etoposide with oral mitotane +/- surgical resection in patients with metastatic ACC. Thirty-six patients with metastatic ACC received daily oral mitotane (mean, 4.6 g/day) and 96-hour infusional doxorubicin (10 mg/m(2)/day), etoposide (75 mg/m(2)/day), and vincristine (0.4 mg/m(2)/day). Four responding patients (11%) underwent surgery. Thirty-five patients were evaluable; all had metastatic disease. Eleven patients had not undergone resection of the primary tumor. Approximately 53% of patients had functional tumors. A total of 190 cycles were administered to 36 patients. Responses were observed in 8 patients (22%): 1 complete, 4 partial, and 3 minor responses. The mean duration of response was 12.4 months. Using a landmark method, the median survival of patients who did not respond to chemotherapy was 11.6 months from a point 4 months after the initiation of therapy, whereas that of 8 patients who demonstrated a response to chemotherapy was 34.3 months from that same landmark. High levels of Pgp expression were documented in nine of nine tumors. Mitotane levels > 10 microg/mL, previously shown to antagonize Pgp in vitro, were achieved in 25 of 36 patients (69%). However, rhodamine efflux from CD56-positive cells was not impaired, suggesting poor in vivo Pgp inhibition. The predominant Grade 3/4 toxicity (according to the Common Toxicity Criteria of the National Cancer Institute) was neutropenia in 66% of cycles; however, fever occurred in only 3% of cycles. Daily mitotane was associated with Grade 1/2 nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, and neuropsychiatric changes in 31 of 36 patients (86%). Using a combination regimen of daily mitotane with infusional doxorubicin, vincristine, and etoposide in patients with metastatic ACC, responses were observed in 22% of patients. The superiority of this combination over single-agent mitotane is uncertain. The side effects of mitotane made treatment difficult. More effective Pgp antagonists are needed.",Journal Article,6474.0,102.0,carcinoma ACC is rare nearly always fatal and to the authors knowledge has few nonsurgical treatment options Based on in vitro studies demonstrating the efficacy of mitotane as a P-glycoprotein Pgp antagonist and expression of high levels of Pgp in ACC the authors conducted a study of infusional doxorubicin vincristine and etoposide with oral mitotane +/- surgical resection in patients with metastatic ACC Thirty-six patients with metastatic ACC received daily oral mitotane mean 4.6 g/day and 96-hour infusional doxorubicin 10 mg/m 2 /day etoposide 75 mg/m 2 /day and vincristine 0.4 mg/m 2 /day Four responding patients 11 underwent surgery Thirty-five patients were evaluable all had metastatic disease Eleven patients had not undergone resection of the primary tumor Approximately 53 of patients had functional tumors A total of 190 cycles were administered to 36 patients Responses were observed in 8 patients 22 1 complete 4 partial and 3 minor responses The mean duration of response was 12.4 months Using a landmark method the median survival of patients who did not respond to chemotherapy was 11.6 months from a point 4 months after the initiation of therapy whereas that of 8 patients who demonstrated a response to chemotherapy was 34.3 months from that same landmark High levels of Pgp expression were documented in nine of nine tumors Mitotane levels 10 microg/mL previously shown to antagonize Pgp in vitro were achieved in 25 of 36 patients 69 However rhodamine efflux from CD56-positive cells was not impaired suggesting poor in vivo Pgp inhibition The predominant Grade 3/4 toxicity according to the Common Toxicity Criteria of the National Cancer Institute was neutropenia in 66 of cycles however fever occurred in only 3 of cycles Daily mitotane was associated with Grade 1/2 nausea diarrhea fatigue and neuropsychiatric changes in 31 of 36 patients 86 Using a combination regimen of daily mitotane with infusional doxorubicin vincristine and etoposide in patients with metastatic ACC responses were observed in 22 of patients The superiority of this combination over single-agent mitotane is uncertain The side effects of mitotane made treatment difficult More effective Pgp antagonists are needed,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[134, 3267, 16, 622, 1857, 3763, 3034, 2, 6, 3, 738, 922, 71, 1021, 5544, 24, 838, 90, 23, 4, 439, 94, 2219, 3, 209, 1, 11559, 22, 8, 19, 4455, 7131, 3137, 2, 55, 1, 64, 148, 1, 7131, 4, 3267, 3, 738, 426, 8, 45, 1, 4825, 856, 2132, 2, 1934, 5, 518, 11559, 221, 170, 4, 7, 5, 113, 3267, 977, 437, 7, 5, 113, 3267, 103, 391, 518, 11559, 313, 39, 49, 499, 218, 2, 921, 2583, 4825, 856, 79, 81, 188, 18, 218, 1934, 481, 81, 188, 18, 218, 2, 2132, 13, 39, 81, 188, 18, 218, 294, 3261, 7, 175, 208, 152, 977, 365, 7, 11, 859, 62, 42, 113, 34, 2627, 7, 42, 44, 1989, 170, 1, 3, 86, 30, 705, 699, 1, 7, 42, 583, 57, 8, 181, 1, 5974, 410, 11, 468, 6, 511, 7, 253, 11, 164, 4, 66, 7, 350, 14, 236, 39, 450, 2, 27, 2278, 253, 3, 313, 654, 1, 51, 10, 133, 39, 53, 75, 8, 3829, 596, 3, 52, 25, 1, 7, 54, 205, 44, 1892, 6, 56, 10, 175, 49, 53, 29, 8, 741, 39, 53, 50, 3, 1118, 1, 36, 547, 17, 1, 66, 7, 54, 264, 8, 51, 6, 56, 10, 562, 27, 53, 29, 17, 827, 3829, 64, 148, 1, 7131, 55, 11, 1405, 4, 762, 1, 762, 57, 11559, 148, 79, 2440, 542, 373, 443, 6, 12718, 7131, 4, 439, 11, 513, 4, 243, 1, 511, 7, 790, 137, 18742, 7043, 29, 5803, 109, 37, 10, 44, 2364, 802, 334, 4, 386, 7131, 297, 3, 2750, 88, 27, 39, 155, 768, 6, 3, 186, 155, 371, 1, 3, 657, 12, 1377, 10, 778, 4, 700, 1, 410, 137, 2775, 489, 4, 158, 27, 1, 410, 391, 11559, 10, 41, 5, 88, 14, 18, 1218, 1172, 613, 2, 14427, 400, 4, 456, 1, 511, 7, 868, 75, 8, 150, 477, 1, 391, 11559, 5, 4825, 856, 2132, 2, 1934, 4, 7, 5, 113, 3267, 253, 11, 164, 4, 350, 1, 7, 3, 5233, 1, 26, 150, 252, 226, 420, 11559, 16, 2717, 3, 1152, 176, 1, 11559, 1229, 24, 1740, 80, 323, 7131, 4444, 32, 575]",2221.0,12015757,33
Long-term (15 years) outcome in an infant with metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2002-10-01,"Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare malignancy in children, with a high mortality. Little is known about long-term outcome, especially in infants treated with mitotane. We report the successful long-term outcome of a case of metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma presenting in infancy treated with surgical resection and mitotane. The patient presented at 2 months of age with Cushing's syndrome, a large adrenal mass, and elevated adrenal steroid levels. The tumor was removed surgically. Intraoperative findings included an adrenal tumor (confirmed malignant pathologically) invading the adrenal vein and vena cava. After surgery he was treated with mitotane at a dose of 2 g/d. Six months after surgery 11-deoxycortisol levels increased, and a computed tomography scan showed a pulmonary metastasis. Mitotane was increased to 2.5 g/d, and the metastasis was removed surgically. Plasma mitotane levels ranged 10-15 micro g/ml. Tumor markers remained normal, and mitotane was discontinued at 18 months. During therapy the patient's somatic growth was poor.

Radiofrequency ablation of adrenal tumors and adrenocortical carcinoma metastases.,Cancer,Cancer,2003-02-01,"The current study was performed to analyze the feasibility, safety, imaging appearance, and short-term efficacy of image-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of primary and metastatic adrenal neoplasms including adrenocortical carcinoma. The procedure was performed using 36 treatment spheres on 15 adrenocortical carcinoma primary or metastatic tumors in eight patients over 27 months. Tumors ranged from 15 to 90 mm in greatest dimension with a mean of 43 mm. All patients had unresectable tumors or were poor candidates for surgery. Mean follow-up was 10.3 months. All patients were discharged or were free of procedure-related medical care 6-48 hours after the procedures without major complications. All treatments resulted in presumptive coagulation necrosis by imaging criteria, which manifested as loss of previous contrast enhancement in ablated tissue. Eight of 15 (53%) posttreatment thermal lesions lost enhancement and stopped growing on latest follow-up computed tomographic scan. Three of 15 (20%) demonstrated interval growth and four did not change in size. Of these four lesions, two showed contrast enhancement. For smaller tumors with a mean greatest dimension less than or equal to 5 cm, 8 of 12 (67%) tumors were completely ablated, as defined by decreasing size and complete loss of contrast enhancement. Three of 15 (20 %) tumors and related thermal lesions were found to have disappeared nearly completely on imaging. Percutaneous, image-guided RFA is a safe and well tolerated procedure for the treatment of unresectable primary or metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma. The procedure is effective for the short-term local control of small adrenal tumors, and is most effective for tumors less than 5 cm. The survival rate for patients with adrenocortical carcinoma improves when radical excision is performed in selected patients. Aggressive local disease control may potentially influence survival as well. However, further study is required to evaluate survival impact, document long-term efficacy, and to determine if RFA can obviate repeated surgical intervention in specific clinical scenarios.",Clinical Trial,6198.0,199.0,The current study was performed to analyze the feasibility safety imaging appearance and short-term efficacy of image-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation RFA of primary and metastatic adrenal neoplasms including carcinoma The procedure was performed using 36 treatment spheres on 15 carcinoma primary or metastatic tumors in eight patients over 27 months Tumors ranged from 15 to 90 mm in greatest dimension with a mean of 43 mm All patients had unresectable tumors or were poor candidates for surgery Mean follow-up was 10.3 months All patients were discharged or were free of procedure-related medical care 6-48 hours after the procedures without major complications All treatments resulted in presumptive coagulation necrosis by imaging criteria which manifested as loss of previous contrast enhancement in ablated tissue Eight of 15 53 posttreatment thermal lesions lost enhancement and stopped growing on latest follow-up computed tomographic scan Three of 15 20 demonstrated interval growth and four did not change in size Of these four lesions two showed contrast enhancement For smaller tumors with a mean greatest dimension less than or equal to 5 cm 8 of 12 67 tumors were completely ablated as defined by decreasing size and complete loss of contrast enhancement Three of 15 20 tumors and related thermal lesions were found to have disappeared nearly completely on imaging Percutaneous image-guided RFA is a safe and well tolerated procedure for the treatment of unresectable primary or metastatic carcinoma The procedure is effective for the short-term local control of small adrenal tumors and is most effective for tumors less than 5 cm The survival rate for patients with carcinoma improves when radical excision is performed in selected patients Aggressive local disease control may potentially influence survival as well However further study is required to evaluate survival impact document long-term efficacy and to determine if RFA can obviate repeated surgical intervention in specific clinical scenarios,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 291, 45, 10, 173, 6, 1992, 3, 1437, 367, 270, 3592, 2, 978, 337, 209, 1, 1482, 1808, 3720, 5567, 1650, 3463, 1, 86, 2, 113, 2987, 1179, 141, 134, 3, 1299, 10, 173, 75, 511, 24, 10304, 23, 167, 134, 86, 15, 113, 57, 4, 659, 7, 252, 428, 53, 57, 1869, 29, 167, 6, 424, 321, 4, 2199, 6384, 5, 8, 313, 1, 601, 321, 62, 7, 42, 1468, 57, 15, 11, 334, 1931, 9, 152, 313, 166, 126, 10, 79, 27, 53, 62, 7, 11, 6155, 15, 11, 115, 1, 1299, 139, 484, 165, 49, 576, 1459, 50, 3, 1369, 187, 458, 521, 62, 640, 627, 4, 15509, 7269, 1523, 20, 270, 371, 92, 6023, 22, 407, 1, 698, 748, 2461, 4, 9463, 246, 659, 1, 167, 699, 3149, 6244, 406, 3009, 2461, 2, 4403, 1921, 23, 5923, 166, 126, 1220, 6158, 1657, 169, 1, 167, 179, 264, 268, 129, 2, 294, 205, 44, 707, 4, 444, 1, 46, 294, 406, 100, 224, 748, 2461, 9, 2170, 57, 5, 8, 313, 2199, 6384, 299, 76, 15, 2997, 6, 33, 494, 66, 1, 133, 598, 57, 11, 2500, 9463, 22, 395, 20, 2777, 444, 2, 236, 407, 1, 748, 2461, 169, 1, 167, 179, 57, 2, 139, 6244, 406, 11, 204, 6, 47, 14399, 1857, 2500, 23, 270, 3720, 1482, 1808, 3463, 16, 8, 1165, 2, 149, 421, 1299, 9, 3, 24, 1, 1468, 86, 15, 113, 134, 3, 1299, 16, 323, 9, 3, 978, 337, 293, 182, 1, 302, 2987, 57, 2, 16, 96, 323, 9, 57, 299, 76, 33, 494, 3, 25, 116, 9, 7, 5, 134, 1804, 198, 711, 1366, 16, 173, 4, 715, 7, 571, 293, 34, 182, 68, 751, 1054, 25, 22, 149, 137, 195, 45, 16, 616, 6, 376, 25, 345, 4753, 319, 337, 209, 2, 6, 223, 492, 3463, 122, 14808, 2113, 221, 788, 4, 112, 38, 3964]",2033.0,12548596,20
Adenomatoid tumor of the adrenal gland: a clinicopathologic study of 3 cases.,Annals of diagnostic pathology,Ann Diagn Pathol,2005-02-01,"Adenomatoid tumors are relatively uncommon benign neoplasms of mesothelial origin, usually occurring in the male and female genital tracts. Rare extragenital adenomatoid tumors have been identified in the adrenal glands, heart, mesentery, pleura, and lymph nodes. In the adrenal gland, adenomatoid tumors may pose a diagnostic challenge. The differential diagnosis includes adrenocortical carcinoma and metastatic carcinoma, especially signet ring cell carcinoma. Because of its glandular pattern, an adenomatoid tumor may be confused with an adenocarcinoma. We present 3 cases of adrenal adenomatoid tumors, including one with a concurrent large hemorrhagic vascular adrenal cyst. The adenomatoid tumors were unilateral, appeared solid and white, and varied from 1.7 to 4.2 cm in diameter. They occurred in 3 male patients aged 33, 33, and 46 years. One patient presented with abdominal pain due to the presence of a concurrent large adrenal cyst. The tumor was an incidental radiological finding in another case and was discovered during the course of a workup for hypertension in the third case. The light microscopic appearances were consistent with those of typical adenomatoid tumors.

Pharmacol.,2006-05-30,"Paclitaxel and interferon have demonstrated anti-angiogenic activity in vitro and in vivo. The toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of paclitaxel with interferon-alpha2b (IFN-alpha2b) were assessed in patients with solid tumors to assess the feasibility of this novel anti-angiogenic regimen. IFN-alpha2b (1 million units) was administered twice daily by subcutaneous injection. Paclitaxel was given weekly over 1 h starting at 30 mg/m2 and increased to 50 mg/m2. Cycles were repeated every 4 weeks. Nineteen patients with a variety of solid tumors were enrolled. Dose-limiting toxicity in cycle 1 was observed at 50 mg/m2. Eleven patients were treated at 40 mg/m2 with no undue toxicity. Pharmacokinetic parameter comparison studies were completed in 11 patients who received days 1 and 29 paclitaxel. Mean paclitaxel clearance and area under the curve (0-infinity) were not statistically different from days 1 to 29. There was a 50% increase in the average Cmax from days 1 to 29. There was also a 73% decrease of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels in these 11 patients from days 1 to 29 (p < 0.0005). All three patients with cutaneous angiosarcomas experienced clinically meaningful remissions. In addition, minor responses were observed in one patient with heavily pretreated ovarian cancer and another with adrenocortical carcinoma. This trial details the inability to dose escalate to the maximum tolerated dose of weekly paclitaxel when combined with low-dose interferon.

Beyond Li Fraumeni Syndrome: clinical characteristics of families with p53 germline mutations.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-02-09,"A clinical testing cohort was used to gain a broader understanding of the spectrum of tumors associated with germline p53 mutations to aid clinicians in identifying high-risk families. Full sequencing of the coding exons (2 to 11) and associated splice junctions of the p53 gene was performed on 525 consecutive patients whose blood samples were submitted for diagnostic testing. Clinical features of p53 germline carriers in this cohort were characterized, clinical referral schemes based on reported p53-associated family phenotypes were evaluated, and practical mutation prevalence tables were generated. Mutations were identified in 91 (17%) of 525 patients submitted for testing. All families with a p53 mutation had at least one family member with a sarcoma, breast, brain, or adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). Every individual with a choroid plexus tumor (eight of eight) and 14 of 21 individuals with a childhood ACC had a mutation regardless of family history. Based on reported personal and family history, 95% of patients (71 of 75) with a mutation met either classic Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) or Chompret criteria. A simplified prevalence table provides a concise summary of individual and family characteristics associated with p53 mutations.

A standard 3 + 3 phase I dose-escalation design was used with a 28-day cycle (sorafenib daily and tipifarnib for 21 days, by mouth). Fifty patients were treated; 43 reached restaging evaluation after cycle 2. The most common side effects were grade 1 to 2 rash, hyperglycemia, and diarrhea. Dose-limiting toxicity was rash, and the recommended phase II dose is sorafenib 400 mg p.o. qam/200 mg p.o. qpm and tipifarnib p.o. 100 mg bd. Despite the low doses of tipifarnib, one quarter of patients had > or =50% reduction in farnesyltransferase levels. Interestingly, six of eight patients with medullary thyroid cancer had durable stable disease (n = 3) or partial remissions (n = 3), lasting 12 to 26+ months. Five of the six responders had available tissue, and RET gene mutations were identified in them.

Proposal for modification of the ENSAT staging system for adrenocortical carcinoma using tumor grade.,Langenbeck's archives of surgery,Langenbecks Arch Surg,2010-08-09,"Various staging systems for adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) have been proposed. We hypothesized that incorporating tumor grade into the current European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors (ENSAT) staging system would improve the ability to more accurately predict time to recurrence and death. A retrospective review of patients included in the University of Michigan ACC database from 2005 to 2009 was done; and stage, tumor grade, time to recurrence, and death were recorded and analyzed using the Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Ninety one patients had complete information for inclusion. The median follow-up was 24 months while the median time to recurrence was 4.1 months. There were 28 deaths; overall, tumor grade showed a significant difference in time to tumor recurrence (p = 0.011) and time to death (p = 0.004). Time to death among stage 2 patients separated into those with high- and low-grade tumors reached statistical significance (p = 0.05), and notable but not statistically significant differences were identified in all stages. Based on tumor grade and survival curves, modifications to the current ENSAT staging system were made. Tumor grade plays a significant role in the outcome of patients with ACC. High-grade tumors are associated with shorter disease-free intervals and shorter overall survival. The proposed modification of the ENSAT staging system allows for incorporation of tumor grade when predicting overall survival.",Journal Article,3452.0,38.0,Various staging systems for carcinoma ACC have been proposed We hypothesized that incorporating tumor grade into the current European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors ENSAT staging system would improve the ability to more accurately predict time to recurrence and death A retrospective review of patients included in the University of Michigan ACC database from 2005 to 2009 was done and stage tumor grade time to recurrence and death were recorded and analyzed using the Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival curves Ninety one patients had complete information for inclusion The median follow-up was 24 months while the median time to recurrence was 4.1 months There were 28 deaths overall tumor grade showed a significant difference in time to tumor recurrence p 0.011 and time to death p 0.004 Time to death among stage 2 patients separated into those with high- and low-grade tumors reached statistical significance p 0.05 and notable but not statistically significant differences were identified in all stages Based on tumor grade and survival curves modifications to the current ENSAT staging system were made Tumor grade plays a significant role in the outcome of patients with ACC High-grade tumors are associated with shorter disease-free intervals and shorter overall survival The proposed modification of the ENSAT staging system allows for incorporation of tumor grade when predicting overall survival,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[747, 632, 1530, 9, 134, 3267, 47, 85, 1587, 21, 1237, 17, 2570, 30, 88, 237, 3, 291, 1865, 1801, 9, 3, 45, 1, 2987, 57, 29043, 632, 398, 688, 401, 3, 801, 6, 80, 2141, 678, 98, 6, 146, 2, 273, 8, 459, 206, 1, 7, 159, 4, 3, 1652, 1, 9432, 3267, 609, 29, 1242, 6, 1238, 10, 1822, 2, 82, 30, 88, 98, 6, 146, 2, 273, 11, 1872, 2, 311, 75, 3, 418, 320, 2, 876, 882, 25, 2400, 2493, 104, 7, 42, 236, 487, 9, 1680, 3, 52, 166, 126, 10, 259, 53, 369, 3, 52, 98, 6, 146, 10, 39, 14, 53, 125, 11, 339, 1043, 63, 30, 88, 224, 8, 93, 523, 4, 98, 6, 30, 146, 19, 13, 3651, 2, 98, 6, 273, 19, 13, 1520, 98, 6, 273, 107, 82, 18, 7, 4910, 237, 135, 5, 64, 2, 154, 88, 57, 1300, 1050, 724, 19, 13, 474, 2, 4090, 84, 44, 712, 93, 362, 11, 108, 4, 62, 1153, 90, 23, 30, 88, 2, 25, 2400, 2916, 6, 3, 291, 29043, 632, 398, 11, 1229, 30, 88, 1698, 8, 93, 200, 4, 3, 228, 1, 7, 5, 3267, 64, 88, 57, 32, 41, 5, 985, 34, 115, 1582, 2, 985, 63, 25, 3, 1587, 2437, 1, 3, 29043, 632, 398, 2333, 9, 2838, 1, 30, 88, 198, 1434, 63, 25]",1423.0,20694732,38
Association of the highly prevalent TP53 R337H mutation with pediatric choroid plexus carcinoma and osteosarcoma in southeast Brazil.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-12-29,"The inherited, low-penetrance arginine-to-histidine substitution at codon 337 (R337H) of the tumor protein 53 gene (TP53) is clustered in southeast Brazil (estimated frequency, 0.3%). Although its tumorigenic effect initially appeared to be tissue-specific, recent evidence suggests its association with a broader range of tumors. Therefore, the authors of this report investigated the spectrum of pediatric malignancies associated with the TP53 R337H mutation at a single referral institution in southeast Brazil. Genomic DNA samples from 493 children with malignancies were screened for the R337H mutation. Available tumor samples from carriers were investigated for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and nuclear p53 accumulation. Clinical data were obtained from medical records. Sixty-five of 70 patients (93%) with adrenocortical tumors (ACTs), 9 of 13 patients (69%) with choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC), and 3 of 41 patients (7.3%) with osteosarcoma carried the mutation. The proportion of CPC to choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) was much higher than that reported elsewhere. Osteosarcoma in carriers had a significantly poorer outcome (P = .02). The mutation was not identified in patients who had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 187), recurrent ALL (n = 49), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 44), lymphoma (n = 30), non-CPC central nervous system tumors (n = 26), Ewing sarcoma (n = 25), or rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 8). Among the tumors that were available for analysis, LOH with retention of the mutant allele was confirmed in 21 of 21 ACTs, in 2 of 2 CPCs, and in 2 of 3 osteosarcomas that were positive for R337H. CPCs and osteosarcomas that were positive for R337H had marked nuclear accumulation of p53. The current findings demonstrated compellingly that the TP53 R337H mutation is associated not only with ACT but also with CPC and, to a lesser extent, with osteosarcoma, both of which are core-component tumors of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome.",Journal Article,3310.0,45.0,The inherited low-penetrance arginine-to-histidine substitution at codon 337 R337H of the tumor protein 53 gene TP53 is clustered in southeast Brazil estimated frequency 0.3 Although its tumorigenic effect initially appeared to be tissue-specific recent evidence suggests its association with a broader range of tumors Therefore the authors of this report investigated the spectrum of pediatric malignancies associated with the TP53 R337H mutation at a single referral institution in southeast Brazil Genomic DNA samples from 493 children with malignancies were screened for the R337H mutation Available tumor samples from carriers were investigated for loss of heterozygosity LOH and nuclear p53 accumulation Clinical data were obtained from medical records Sixty-five of 70 patients 93 with tumors ACTs 9 of 13 patients 69 with choroid plexus carcinoma CPC and 3 of 41 patients 7.3 with carried the mutation The proportion of CPC to choroid plexus papilloma CPP was much higher than that reported elsewhere in carriers had a significantly poorer outcome P .02 The mutation was not identified in patients who had acute lymphoblastic ALL n 187 recurrent ALL n 49 acute myeloid n 44 n 30 non-CPC central nervous system tumors n 26 n 25 or n 8 Among the tumors that were available for analysis LOH with retention of the mutant allele was confirmed in 21 of 21 ACTs in 2 of 2 CPCs and in 2 of 3 osteosarcomas that were positive for R337H CPCs and osteosarcomas that were positive for R337H had marked nuclear accumulation of p53 The current findings demonstrated compellingly that the TP53 R337H mutation is associated not only with ACT but also with CPC and to a lesser extent with both of which are core-component tumors of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 2986, 154, 4792, 5392, 6, 15954, 5029, 28, 3673, 8275, 29109, 1, 3, 30, 178, 699, 145, 1206, 16, 6464, 4, 21377, 10452, 661, 675, 13, 27, 242, 211, 3795, 254, 1625, 2121, 6, 40, 246, 112, 435, 241, 844, 211, 248, 5, 8, 5410, 184, 1, 57, 673, 3, 738, 1, 26, 414, 565, 3, 1873, 1, 815, 441, 41, 5, 3, 1206, 29109, 258, 28, 8, 226, 2096, 731, 4, 21377, 10452, 572, 261, 347, 29, 11304, 541, 5, 441, 11, 2261, 9, 3, 29109, 258, 390, 30, 347, 29, 1316, 11, 565, 9, 407, 1, 3963, 2594, 2, 928, 624, 1835, 38, 74, 11, 683, 29, 484, 1064, 1746, 365, 1, 431, 7, 966, 5, 57, 4459, 83, 1, 233, 7, 790, 5, 12169, 9576, 134, 9305, 2, 27, 1, 605, 7, 67, 27, 5, 2629, 3, 258, 3, 920, 1, 9305, 6, 12169, 9576, 7017, 17117, 10, 1802, 142, 76, 17, 210, 7116, 4, 1316, 42, 8, 97, 1769, 228, 19, 588, 3, 258, 10, 44, 108, 4, 7, 54, 42, 286, 1275, 62, 78, 5568, 387, 62, 78, 739, 286, 533, 78, 584, 78, 201, 220, 9305, 854, 1880, 398, 57, 78, 432, 78, 243, 15, 78, 66, 107, 3, 57, 17, 11, 390, 9, 65, 2594, 5, 3947, 1, 3, 620, 1254, 10, 557, 4, 239, 1, 239, 4459, 4, 18, 1, 18, 12903, 2, 4, 18, 1, 27, 11089, 17, 11, 109, 9, 29109, 12903, 2, 11089, 17, 11, 109, 9, 29109, 42, 2003, 928, 1835, 1, 624, 3, 291, 272, 264, 46385, 17, 3, 1206, 29109, 258, 16, 41, 44, 158, 5, 2559, 84, 120, 5, 9305, 2, 6, 8, 5191, 1039, 5, 110, 1, 92, 32, 1793, 1249, 57, 1, 3, 5066, 9130, 681]",1747.0,21192060,29
Phase I trial of cixutumumab combined with temsirolimus in patients with advanced cancer.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2011-07-12,"Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors mediate AKT activation through a type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R)-dependent mechanism. Combining the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus with cixutumumab, a fully human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody directed against IGF-1R, was expected to enhance mTOR-targeted anticancer activity by modulating resistance to mTOR inhibition. The objectives of this phase I study were to evaluate the tolerability and activity of temsirolimus and cixutumumab. Patients in sequential cohorts (""3 + 3"" design) received escalating doses of temsirolimus with cixutumumab weekly for 28 days. At the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), 21 patients were randomized into three separate drug sequence treatment groups for serial blood draws and 2[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography combined with X-ray computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) scans for pharmacodynamic analyses (PD). Forty-two patients with advanced cancer (19 male/23 female, median age = 53, median number of prior therapies = 4) were enrolled. MTD was reached at cixutumumab, 6 mg/kg IV and temsirolimus, 25 mg IV. Dose-limiting toxicities included grade 3 mucositis, febrile neutropenia, and grade 4 thrombocytopenia. The most frequent toxicities were hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, thrombocytopenia, and mucositis. Tumor reduction was observed in 2 of 3 patients with Ewing's sarcoma and in 4 of 10 patients with adrenocortical carcinoma. PD data suggest that cixutumumab alone or combined with temsirolimus increased plasma IGF-1 and IGF binding protein 3.

A debate on laparoscopic versus open adrenalectomy for adrenocortical carcinoma.,Hormones & cancer,Horm Cancer,2011-12-01,"Adrenocortical cancer (ACC) is a rare disease that is difficult to treat. Surgery remains the primary treatment modality and the only chance for cure in these patients. Since the early 1990s, laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) has replaced open adrenalectomy (OA) as the gold standard for addressing adrenal disorders of benign origin; however, the oncologic effectiveness of laparoscopic adrenalectomy for resection of primary adrenocortical malignancies remains unclear. Since the initial consensus statement from the International Adrenal Cancer Symposium held in Ann Arbor, MI in 2003, a number of studies have investigated the question of equivalence of LA compared to OA for ACC. Several controversial topics were debated during the 3rd International Adrenal Cancer Symposium held in Wurzburg, Germany in 2011. This debate sought to review the advantages and disadvantages of OA versus LA and review findings of recent studies related to the topic. As all studies involving this topic have methodological flaws, some more than others, the results of each study must be interpreted with caution. In conclusion, this debate will undoubtedly continue well into the future; however, it is clear that an oncologically appropriate surgical resection is of the utmost importance for the treatment of ACC and there is only one chance to achieve this. Poor outcomes will result from inadequate surgery, whether performed by an open or laparoscopic approach.

Necroptosis is a novel mechanism of radiation-induced cell death in anaplastic thyroid and adrenocortical cancers.,Surgery,Surgery,2011-12-01,"Necroptosis is a recently described mechanism of programmed cellular death. We hypothesize that necroptosis plays an important role in radiation-induced cell death in endocrine cancers.

H295R cells deficient in receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1), an essential kinase for necroptosis, were used as controls. Survival curves were generated at increasing doses of radiation. Nec-1 and zVAD increased cellular survival with increasing doses of radiotherapy in 8505c, TPC-1, and SW13. Both inhibitors used together had an additive effect. At 6 Gy, 8505c, TPC-1, and SW13 cell survival was significantly increased compared to controls by 40%, 33%, and 31% with Nec-1 treatment, by 53%, 47%, and 44% with zVAD treatment, and by 80%, 70%, and 65% with both compounds, respectively (P < .05). H295R showed no change in survival with Nec-1 treatment. The radiobiologic parameter quasithreshold dose was significantly increased in 8505c, TPC-1, and SW13 cells when both Nec-1 and zVAD were used in combination to inhibit necroptosis and apoptosis together, revealing resistance to standard doses of fractionated therapeutic radiation.

Three of the 4, a peritoneal mesothelioma, a pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma, and a pancreatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor, represented tumor types that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been previously reported in Lynch syndrome. The fourth tumor was an adrenocortical carcinoma, which has rarely been reported previously in Lynch syndrome. Three of our 4 patients carried a pathogenic germ-line mutation in a mismatch repair gene. The unusual tumor in each of the 3 patients showed loss of the mismatch repair protein corresponding to the mutation. The fourth patient did not have mutation information but had a history of colonic and endometrial carcinomas; both lacked MSH2 and MSH6 proteins.

Worsening central sarcopenia and increasing intra-abdominal fat correlate with decreased survival in patients with adrenocortical carcinoma.,World journal of surgery,World J Surg,2012-07-01,"Accurate prediction of survival from adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is difficult and current staging models are unreliable. Central sarcopenia as part of the cachexia syndrome is a marker of frailty and predicts mortality. This study seeks to confirm that psoas muscle density (PMD), lean psoas muscle area (LPMA), lumbar skeletal muscle index (LSMI), and intra-abdominal (IA) or subcutaneous fat (SC) can be used in combination to more accurately predict survival in ACC patients. PMD, LPMA, IA, and SC fat were measured on serial CT scans of patients with ACC. Clinical outcome was correlated with quantitative data from patients with ACC and analyzed. A linear regression model was used to describe the relationship between PMD, LPMA, LSMI, IA, and SC fat, time to recurrence, and length of survival according to tumor stage. One hundred twenty-five ACC patients (94 females) were treated from 2005 to 2011. Significant morphometric predictors of survival include PMD, LPMA, and IA fat (p ≤ 0.0001, ≤ 0.0024, <0.0001, respectively) and improve prediction of survival compared to using stage alone. A 100-mm(2) increase in LPMA confers an 8 % lower hazard of death. LSMI does not change significantly between stages (p = 0.3196).

Resection of adrenocortical carcinoma liver metastasis: is it justified?,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2012-04-21,"Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) liver metastases (LM) represent a therapeutic challenge, and it is unclear whether resection is justified. This study assesses long-term outcome and prognostic factors after liver resection for metastatic ACC. Patients who underwent resection of ACC LM were identified from institutional databases. Recurrence, survival, and tumor characteristics, including β-catenin and TP53 status based on immunohistochemistry and sequencing, were reviewed. The prognostic value of variables was assessed with log-rank test for univariate analysis and Cox proportional hazard models for multivariate analysis. From 1978 to 2009, 28 patients (20 females; median age, 45 years), including 11 with synchronous metastasis and 3 with extrahepatic metastasis, underwent resection for ACC LM (major hepatectomy in 61%). Postoperative mortality was nil and morbidity 55%. On pathological examination, tumors were multiple in 68%, with a median size of 43 mm, and resections were R0, 1, and 2 in 59%, 33%, and 7%, respectively. All 28 patients developed recurrent disease, which was treated surgically in 11, including repeat hepatectomy in 4. Of the 15 patients with adequate tissue for analysis, β-catenin immunostaining was positive in 7, with 4 corresponding CTNNB1 mutations associated with decreased survival; p53 staining was positive in 5 (4 with corresponding TP53 mutations). The median disease-free and overall survival after hepatectomy was 7 and 31.5 months, respectively, with a 5-year survival of 39%.

A prospective study of expectant observation as primary therapy for neuroblastoma in young infants: a Children's Oncology Group study.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2012-10-01,"To demonstrate that expectant observation of young infants with small adrenal masses would result in excellent event-free and overall survival. Neuroblastoma is the most common malignant tumor in infants, and in young infants, 90% of neuroblastomas are located in the adrenal gland. Although surgical resection is standard therapy, multiple observations suggest that expectant observation could be a safe alternative for infants younger than 6 months who have small adrenal masses. A prospective study of infants younger than 6 months with small adrenal masses and no evidence of spreading beyond the primary tumor was performed at participating Children's Oncology Group institutions. Parents could choose observation or immediate surgical resection. Serial abdominal sonograms and urinary vanillylmandelic acid and homovanillic acid measurements were performed during a 90-week interval. Infants experiencing a 50% increase in the volume of the mass, urine catecholamine values, or an increase in the homovanillic acid to vanillylmandelic acid ratio greater than 2, were referred for surgical resection. Eighty-seven eligible patients were enrolled: 83 elected observation and 4 chose immediate surgery. Sixteen observational patients ultimately had surgery; 8 had International Neuroblastoma Staging System stage 1 neuroblastoma, 2 had higher staged neuroblastoma (2B and 4S), 2 had low-grade adrenocortical neoplasm, 2 had adrenal hemorrhage, and 2 had extralobar pulmonary sequestration. The 2 patients with adrenocortical tumors were resected because of a more than 50% increase in tumor volume. The 3-year event-free survival for a neuroblastoma event was 97.7 ± 2.2% within the entire cohort of patients (n = 87). The 3-year overall survival was 100%, with a median follow-up of 3.2 years.

A retrospective cohort analysis of the efficacy of adjuvant radiotherapy after primary surgical resection in patients with adrenocortical carcinoma.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2012-11-12,"Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignancy with high recurrence and mortality rates. The role of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) to improve outcome remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of adjuvant RT on overall survival and recurrence rates of ACC patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of select ACC patients who were seen at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) between 1998 and 2011. All patients in this study underwent primary tumor resection and received adjuvant RT within 3 months of primary surgical resection prior to referral to the MDACC. We compared patients who had surgery and adjuvant RT with patients who had surgery alone. Baseline characteristics and adjuvant mitotane use were not significantly different between the adjuvant RT group (n = 16) and the non-RT group (n = 32). Local recurrence occurred in seven patients (43.8%) who received RT and 10 patients (31.3%) in the control group. At 5 yr, the estimated local recurrence-free rate (95% confidence interval) was 53% (32-87%) in the RT group and 67% (52-86%) in the non-RT group (P = 0.53). The distributions of time to distant recurrence and recurrence-free survival were not significantly different between the two groups.

Outcome and operative data were assessed for the subset undergoing resection with curative intent. Student t and Fisher exact tests and the Kaplan-Meier method were used to compare data (P ≤ .05 was considered statistically significant). One hundred fifty-six patients (64% female; median age, 47 years [range, 18-80]; median follow-up, 26.5 months [range, 1-188]) were identified. Forty-six patients underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy, and 110 underwent open adrenalectomy. Twenty-seven percent of laparoscopic adrenalectomy patients had stage III cancer. After laparoscopic adrenalectomy, 30% had positive margins or intraoperative tumor spill compared to 16% of the open adrenalectomy patients (P = .04). Overall survival for patients with stage II cancer was longer in those undergoing open adrenalectomy (P = .002). Time to visible tumor bed recurrence or peritoneal recurrence in stage II patients was shorter in laparoscopic adrenalectomy patients (P = .002).

The CpG island methylator phenotype: what's in a name?,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2013-06-25,"Although the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) was first identified and has been most extensively studied in colorectal cancer, the term ""CIMP"" has been repeatedly used over the past decade to describe CpG island promoter methylation in other tumor types, including bladder, breast, endometrial, gastric, glioblastoma (gliomas), hepatocellular, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, renal cell, and prostate cancers, as well as for leukemia, melanoma, duodenal adenocarninomas, adrenocortical carcinomas, and neuroblastomas. CIMP has been reported to be useful for predicting prognosis and response to treatment in a variety of tumor types, but it remains unclear whether or not CIMP is a universal phenomenon across human neoplasia or if there should be cancer-specific definitions of the phenotype. Recently, it was shown that somatic isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutations, frequently observed in gliomas, establish CIMP in primary human astrocytes by remodeling the methylome. Interestingly, somatic IDH1 and IDH2 mutations, and loss-of-function mutations in ten-eleven translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenase-2 (TET2) associated with a hypermethylation phenotype, are also found in multiple enchondromas of patients with Ollier disease and Mafucci syndrome, and leukemia, respectively.

Retrospective review of ACC patients seen at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center from 1998 through 2011. A total of 330 patients with median age at diagnosis of 48.5 years; 12 (3.6%) patients were under 18 years. Hormonally functioning tumors represented 41.8% (n=138) of all cases. Surgical resection for the primary tumor was done in 275 (83.3%) patients (45 at MD Anderson (16.4%)). For those who had surgical resection, the median local-recurrence-free time was 1.04 years. Factors associated with local recurrence included positive surgical margins (P=0.007) and advanced disease stage (P=0.026). Median overall survival time for all patients was 3.21 years. Median survival times were 24.1, 6.08, 3.47, and 0.89 years for stages I, II, III, and IV respectively. In multivariable analysis, older age, functioning tumors, and higher disease stage remained significant prognostic factors associated with poor survival.

Pre-clinical studies have suggested potential activity of imatinib in these tumors. We therefore sought to establish a safe, novel treatment regimen combining imatinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy for future study in endocrine cancers. A standard 3 + 3 dose-escalation design was used with a 21-day cycle, including imatinib on days 1-21, dacarbazine on days 1-3, and capecitabine on days 1-14. Twenty patients were treated. The most frequent toxicities were edema and fatigue, with dose-limiting fatigue and dyspnea. The recommended phase II regimen is dacarbazine 250 mg/m2 daily on day 1-3, capecitabine 500 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1-14, and imatinib 300 mg daily on days 1-21 of a 21-day cycle. Interestingly, responses were seen in patients with adrenocortical carcinoma, with 1 of 6 patients experiencing a partial response and a second experiencing a minor response, with progression-free survival of 8.8 and 6.4 months, respectively. The regimen of imatinib, dacarbazine, and capecitabine is well-tolerated. It may have some activity in adrenocortical carcinoma, and further study of this combination or its components may be beneficial for this disease with limited treatment options.

MET abnormalities in patients with genitourinary malignancies and outcomes with c-MET inhibitors.,Clinical genitourinary cancer,Clin Genitourin Cancer,2014-07-03,"The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of MET amplification and mutation among GU malignancies and its association with clinical factors and responses to c-MET inhibitors. Patients with GU malignancies referred to our Phase I Clinical Trials Program were evaluated for MET mutation and amplification and outcomes using protocols with c-MET inhibitors. MET amplification was found in 7 of 97 (7.2%) patients (4/27 renal [all clear cell], 1/18 urothelial, and 2/12 adrenocortical carcinoma), with MET mutation/variant in 3 of 54 (5.6%) (2/20 renal cell carcinoma [RCC] [1 clear cell and 1 papillary] and 1/16 prostate cancer). No demographic characteristics were associated with specific MET abnormalities, but patients who tested positive for mutation or amplification had more metastatic sites (median, 4 vs. 3 for wild type MET). Median overall survival after phase I consultation was 6.1 and 11.5 months for patients with and without a MET alteration, respectively (hazard ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 6.9; P = .034). Twenty-nine (25%) patients were treated according to a c-MET inhibitor protocol. Six (21%) had a partial response (prostate and RCC) and 10 (34%) had stable disease as best response.

Genomic landscape of paediatric adrenocortical tumours.,Nature communications,Nat Commun,2015-03-06,"Paediatric adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare malignancy with poor prognosis. Here we analyse 37 adrenocortical tumours (ACTs) by whole-genome, whole-exome and/or transcriptome sequencing. Most cases (91%) show loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 11p, with uniform selection against the maternal chromosome. IGF2 on chromosome 11p is overexpressed in 100% of the tumours. TP53 mutations and chromosome 17 LOH with selection against wild-type TP53 are observed in 28 ACTs (76%). Chromosomes 11p and 17 undergo copy-neutral LOH early during tumorigenesis, suggesting tumour-driver events. Additional genetic alterations include recurrent somatic mutations in ATRX and CTNNB1 and integration of human herpesvirus-6 in chromosome 11p. A dismal outcome is predicted by concomitant TP53 and ATRX mutations and associated genomic abnormalities, including massive structural variations and frequent background mutations. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the nature, timing and potential prognostic significance of key genetic alterations in paediatric ACT and outline a hypothetical model of paediatric adrenocortical tumorigenesis.

"Linsitinib (OSI-906) versus placebo for patients with locally advanced or metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma: a double-blind, randomised, phase 3 study.",The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2015-03-18,"Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare, aggressive cancer for which few treatment options are available. Linsitinib (OSI-906) is a potent, oral small molecule inhibitor of both IGF-1R and the insulin receptor, which has shown acceptable tolerability and preliminary evidence of anti-tumour activity. We assessed linsitinib against placebo to investigate efficacy in patients with advanced adrenocortical carcinoma. In this international, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study, adult patients with histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma were recruited at clinical sites in nine countries. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) twice-daily 150 mg oral linsitinib or placebo via a web-based, centralised randomisation system and stratified according to previous systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy for adrenocortical carcinoma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and use of one or more oral antihyperglycaemic therapy at randomisation. Allocation was concealed by blinded block size and permuted block randomisation. The primary endpoint was overall survival, calculated from date of randomisation until death from any cause. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00924989. Between Dec 2, 2009, and July 11, 2011, 139 patients were enrolled, of whom 90 were assigned to linsitinib and 49 to placebo. The trial was unblinded on March 19, 2012, based on data monitoring committee recommendation due to the failure of linsitinib to increase either progression-free survival or overall survival. At database lock and based on 92 deaths, no difference in overall survival was noted between linsitinib and placebo (median 323 days [95% CI 256-507] vs 356 days [249-556]; hazard ratio 0·94 [95% CI 0·61-1·44]; p=0·77). The most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse in the linsitinib group were fatigue (three [3%] patients vs no patients in the placebo group), nausea (two [2%] vs none), and hyperglycaemia (two [2%] vs none). No adverse events in the linsitinib group were deemed to be treatment related; one death (due to sepsis and megacolon) in the placebo group was deemed to be treatment related. Linsitinib did not increase overall survival and so cannot be recommended as treatment for this general patient population. Further studies of IGF-1R and insulin receptor inhibitors, together with genetic profiling of responders, might pave the way toward individualised and improved therapeutic options in adrenocortical carcinoma.

Preexisting adrenal masses in patients with adrenocortical carcinoma: clinical and radiological factors contributing to delayed diagnosis.,Endocrine,Endocrine,2015-07-25,"Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare endocrine malignancy that is usually large (>5 cm) at time of diagnosis. Delayed diagnosis significantly worsens survival. We describe adrenal gland morphology prior to ACC diagnosis and discern potential causes of delayed diagnosis. ACC patients seen at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center between 1998 and 2014 who had cross-sectional body imaging ≥3 months prior to their diagnosis. We conducted a detailed review of clinical and radiological features in these patients prior to ACC diagnosis. Of 439 patients with ACC, 25 had imaging preceding ACC diagnosis (5 with normal adrenal glands and 20 with preexisting masses). On the first available images, the median mass size was 2.8 cm (range 0-9) with median precontrast density of 36 Hounsfield units (range 17-43) and became 9 cm (range 1-18) at the time of ACC diagnosis. The median interval between first available image and ACC diagnosis was 20 months (range 3-89). In the 5 patients whose initial images showed normal adrenal glands, the time between the last normal scan and ACC diagnosis ranged from 5 to 36 months. The most common reason for delayed ACC diagnosis was the presumed benign status of the preexisting mass (n = 13, 65 %).

Hepatocyte Growth Factor/cMET Pathway Activation Enhances Cancer Hallmarks in Adrenocortical Carcinoma.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2015-08-17,"Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare malignancy with poor prognosis and limited response to chemotherapy. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor cMET augment cancer growth and resistance to chemotherapy, but their role in adrenocortical carcinoma has not been examined. In this study, we investigated the association between HGF/cMET expression and cancer hallmarks of adrenocortical carcinoma. Transcriptomic and immunohistochemical analyses indicated that increased HGF/cMET expression in human adrenocortical carcinoma samples was positively associated with cancer-related biologic processes, including proliferation and angiogenesis, and negatively correlated with apoptosis. Accordingly, treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma cells with exogenous HGF resulted in increased cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo while short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of cMET suppressed cell proliferation and tumor growth. Moreover, exposure of cells to mitotane, cisplatin, or radiation rapidly induced pro-cMET expression and was associated with an enrichment of genes (e.g., CYP450 family) related to therapy resistance, further implicating cMET in the anticancer drug response. Together, these data suggest an important role for HGF/cMET signaling in adrenocortical carcinoma growth and resistance to commonly used treatments. Targeting cMET, alone or in combination with other drugs, could provide a breakthrough in the management of this aggressive cancer.",Journal Article,1618.0,11.0,carcinoma is a rare malignancy with poor prognosis and limited response to chemotherapy growth factor HGF and its receptor cMET augment cancer growth and resistance to chemotherapy but their role in carcinoma has not been examined In this study we investigated the association between HGF/cMET expression and cancer hallmarks of carcinoma Transcriptomic and immunohistochemical analyses indicated that increased HGF/cMET expression in human carcinoma samples was positively associated with cancer-related biologic processes including proliferation and angiogenesis and negatively correlated with apoptosis Accordingly treatment of carcinoma cells with exogenous HGF resulted in increased cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo while short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of cMET suppressed cell proliferation and tumor growth Moreover exposure of cells to mitotane cisplatin or radiation rapidly induced pro-cMET expression and was associated with an enrichment of genes e.g. CYP450 family related to therapy resistance further implicating cMET in the anticancer drug response Together these data suggest an important role for HGF/cMET signaling in carcinoma growth and resistance to commonly used treatments Targeting cMET alone or in combination with other drugs could provide a breakthrough in the management of this aggressive cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[134, 16, 8, 622, 710, 5, 334, 356, 2, 383, 51, 6, 56, 129, 161, 2942, 2, 211, 153, 8480, 4369, 12, 129, 2, 251, 6, 56, 84, 136, 200, 4, 134, 71, 44, 85, 409, 4, 26, 45, 21, 565, 3, 248, 59, 2942, 8480, 55, 2, 12, 7693, 1, 134, 5983, 2, 1382, 318, 1103, 17, 101, 2942, 8480, 55, 4, 171, 134, 347, 10, 2375, 41, 5, 12, 139, 1283, 1849, 141, 457, 2, 1056, 2, 2723, 438, 5, 351, 4705, 24, 1, 134, 37, 5, 4181, 2942, 627, 4, 101, 31, 457, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 369, 978, 5957, 893, 517, 1563, 15, 2788, 297, 1, 8480, 1908, 31, 457, 2, 30, 129, 1393, 645, 1, 37, 6, 11559, 540, 15, 121, 1755, 277, 1805, 8480, 55, 2, 10, 41, 5, 35, 3020, 1, 214, 563, 499, 28570, 607, 139, 6, 36, 251, 195, 7912, 8480, 4, 3, 1475, 234, 51, 1162, 46, 74, 309, 35, 305, 200, 9, 2942, 8480, 314, 4, 134, 129, 2, 251, 6, 841, 95, 640, 529, 8480, 279, 15, 4, 150, 5, 127, 600, 359, 377, 8, 6022, 4, 3, 284, 1, 26, 571, 12]",1365.0,26282167,40

Oncol.,2015-08-18,"Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignancy. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and patterns of recurrence after curative-intent surgery for ACC. Patients who underwent curative-intent resection for ACC between 1993 and 2014 were identified from 13 academic institutions participating in the United States ACC study group. Patients with metastasis or an R2 margin were excluded. Patterns and rates of recurrence were determined and classified as locoregional and distant recurrence. A total of 180 patients with a median age of 52 years (interquartile range 43-61) were identified. Most patients underwent open surgery (n = 111, 64.5 %) and had an R0 resection margin (n = 117, 75.0 %).

Two hundred nine patients who underwent resection of ACC between January 1993 and December 2014 at 1 of 13 major centers in the USA were identified. Demographic and clinicopathological data were collected and analyzed relative to readmission. Median patient age was 52 years, and 62 % of the patients were female. Median tumor size was 12 cm, and the majority of patients had an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class of 3-4 (n = 85, 56 %). The overall incidence of readmission within 90 days from surgery was 18 % (n = 38). Factors associated with readmission included high ASA class (odds ratio (OR), 4.88 (95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.75-13.61); P = 0.002), metastatic disease on presentation (OR, 2.98 (95 % CI, 1.37-6.46); P = 0.006), EBL (>700 mL: OR, 2.75 (95 % CI, 1.16-6.51); P = 0.02), complication (OR, 1.91 (95 % CI, 1.20-3.05); P = 0.007), and prolonged length of stay (LOS; ≥9 days: OR, 4.12 (95 % CI, 1.88-9.01); P < 0.001). On multivariate logistic regression, a high ASA class (OR, 4.01 (95 % CI, 1.44-11.17); P = 0.008) and metastatic disease on presentation (OR, 3.44 (95 % CI, 1.34-8.84); P = 0.01) remained independently associated with higher odds of readmission. Readmission following surgery for ACC was common as one in five patients experienced a readmission. Patients with a high ASA class and metastatic disease on presentation were over four and three times more likely to be readmitted after surgical treatment for ACC, respectively.",Journal Article,1616.0,1.0,carcinoma ACC is a rare disease with a poor prognosis Given the lack of data on readmission after resection of ACC the objective of the current study was to define the incidence of readmission as well as identify risk factors associated with readmission among patients with ACC who underwent surgical resection Two hundred nine patients who underwent resection of ACC between January 1993 and December 2014 at 1 of 13 major centers in the USA were identified Demographic and clinicopathological data were collected and analyzed relative to readmission Median patient age was 52 years and 62 of the patients were female Median tumor size was 12 cm and the majority of patients had an American Society of Anesthesiologists ASA class of 3-4 n 85 56 The overall incidence of readmission within 90 days from surgery was 18 n 38 Factors associated with readmission included high ASA class odds ratio OR 4.88 95 confidence interval CI 1.75-13.61 P 0.002 metastatic disease on presentation OR 2.98 95 CI 1.37-6.46 P 0.006 EBL 700 mL OR 2.75 95 CI 1.16-6.51 P 0.02 complication OR 1.91 95 CI 1.20-3.05 P 0.007 and prolonged length of stay LOS ≥9 days OR 4.12 95 CI 1.88-9.01 P 0.001 On multivariate logistic regression a high ASA class OR 4.01 95 CI 1.44-11.17 P 0.008 and metastatic disease on presentation OR 3.44 95 CI 1.34-8.84 P 0.01 remained independently associated with higher odds of readmission Readmission following surgery for ACC was common as one in five patients experienced a readmission Patients with a high ASA class and metastatic disease on presentation were over four and three times more likely to be readmitted after surgical treatment for ACC respectively,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[134, 3267, 16, 8, 622, 34, 5, 8, 334, 356, 447, 3, 926, 1, 74, 23, 3146, 50, 170, 1, 3267, 3, 461, 1, 3, 291, 45, 10, 6, 1107, 3, 287, 1, 3146, 22, 149, 22, 255, 43, 130, 41, 5, 3146, 107, 7, 5, 3267, 54, 208, 221, 170, 100, 1128, 762, 7, 54, 208, 170, 1, 3267, 59, 1024, 3343, 2, 1397, 1409, 28, 14, 1, 233, 458, 1168, 4, 3, 2706, 11, 108, 1540, 2, 2721, 74, 11, 786, 2, 311, 580, 6, 3146, 52, 69, 89, 10, 653, 60, 2, 744, 1, 3, 7, 11, 1061, 52, 30, 444, 10, 133, 494, 2, 3, 686, 1, 7, 42, 35, 597, 1174, 1, 9558, 6453, 1040, 1, 27, 39, 78, 772, 664, 3, 63, 287, 1, 3146, 262, 424, 162, 29, 152, 10, 203, 78, 519, 130, 41, 5, 3146, 159, 64, 6453, 1040, 610, 197, 15, 39, 889, 48, 307, 268, 58, 14, 481, 233, 713, 19, 13, 1111, 113, 34, 23, 1031, 15, 18, 1096, 48, 58, 14, 567, 49, 641, 19, 13, 1861, 9541, 5692, 542, 15, 18, 481, 48, 58, 14, 245, 49, 725, 19, 13, 588, 1447, 15, 14, 970, 48, 58, 14, 179, 27, 474, 19, 13, 1999, 2, 1069, 1318, 1, 2020, 3649, 18005, 162, 15, 39, 133, 48, 58, 14, 889, 83, 355, 19, 13, 144, 23, 331, 812, 320, 8, 64, 6453, 1040, 15, 39, 355, 48, 58, 14, 584, 175, 269, 19, 13, 2155, 2, 113, 34, 23, 1031, 15, 27, 584, 48, 58, 14, 562, 66, 874, 19, 13, 355, 958, 1042, 41, 5, 142, 610, 1, 3146, 3146, 366, 152, 9, 3267, 10, 186, 22, 104, 4, 365, 7, 592, 8, 3146, 7, 5, 8, 64, 6453, 1040, 2, 113, 34, 23, 1031, 11, 252, 294, 2, 169, 1072, 80, 322, 6, 40, 8351, 50, 221, 24, 9, 3267, 106]",1670.0,26286367,8
Incidence of Perioperative Complications Following Resection of Adrenocortical Carcinoma and Its Association with Long-Term Survival.,World journal of surgery,World J Surg,2016-03-01,"The association of postoperative complications with long-term oncologic outcomes remains unclear. We sought to determine the incidence of complications among patients who underwent surgery for adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and define the relationship of morbidity with long-term survival. Patients who underwent surgery for ACC between 1993 and 2014 were identified from 13 academic institutions participating in the US ACC group study. The incidence and type of the postoperative complications, the factors associated with them as well their association with long-term survival were analyzed. A total of 265 patients with median age of 52 years (IQR 44-63) were identified; at surgery, the majority of patients underwent an open abdominal procedure (n = 169, 66.8%). A postoperative complication occurred in 99 patients for a morbidity of 37.4%; five patients (1.9%) died in hospital. Factors associated with morbidity included a thoraco-abdominal operative approach (reference: open abdominal; OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.00-8.18), and a hormonally functional tumor (OR 3.56, 95% CI 1.65-7.69) (all P < 0.05). Presence of any complication was associated with a worse long-term outcome (median survival: no complication, 58.9 months vs. any complication, 25.1 months; P = 0.009). In multivariate analysis, after adjusting for patient- and disease-related factors postoperative infectious complications independently predicted shorter overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 5.56, 95% CI 2.24-13.80; P < 0.001).

Nomograms to Predict Recurrence-Free and Overall Survival After Curative Resection of Adrenocortical Carcinoma.,JAMA surgery,JAMA Surg,2016-04-01,"Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare but aggressive endocrine tumor, and the prognostic factors associated with long-term outcomes after surgical resection remain poorly defined. To define clinicopathological variables associated with recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) after curative surgical resection of ACC and to propose nomograms for individual risk prediction. Nomograms to predict RFS and OS after surgical resection of ACC were proposed using a multi-institutional cohort of patients who underwent curative-intent surgery for ACC at 13 major institutions in the United States between March 17, 1994, and December 22, 2014. The dates of our study analysis were April 15, 2015, to May 12, 2015. The discriminative ability and calibration of the nomograms to predict RFS and OS were tested using C statistics, calibration plots, and Kaplan-Meier curves. In total, 148 patients who underwent surgery for ACC were included in the study. The median patient age was 53 years, and 65.5% (97 of 148) of the patients were female. One-third of the patients (35.1% [52 of 148]) had a functional tumor, and the median tumor size was 11.2 cm. Most patients (77.7% [115 of 148]) underwent R0 resection, and 8.8% (13 of 148) of the patients had N1 disease. Using backward stepwise selection of clinically important variables with the Akaike information criterion, the following variables were incorporated in the prediction of RFS: tumor size of at least 12 cm (hazard ratio [HR], 3.00; 95% CI, 1.63-5.70; P < .001), positive nodal status (HR, 4.78; 95% CI, 1.47-15.50; P = .01), stage III/IV (HR, 1.80; 95% CI, 0.95-3.39; P = .07), cortisol-secreting tumor (HR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.27-4.48; P = .01), and capsular invasion (HR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.02-3.74; P = .04). Factors selected as predicting OS were tumor size of at least 12 cm (HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.00-3.17; P = .05), positive nodal status (HR, 5.89; 95% CI, 2.05-16.87; P = .001), and R1 margin (HR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.51-5.30; P = .001). The discriminative ability and calibration of the nomograms revealed good predictive ability as indicated by the C statistics (0.74 for RFS and 0.70 for OS).

Outcomes of Adjuvant Mitotane after Resection of Adrenocortical Carcinoma: A 13-Institution Study by the US Adrenocortical Carcinoma Group.,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,J. Am. Coll. Surg.,2015-12-21,"Current treatment guidelines recommend adjuvant mitotane after resection of adrenocortical carcinoma with high-risk features (eg, tumor rupture, positive margins, positive lymph nodes, high grade, elevated mitotic index, and advanced stage). Limited data exist on the outcomes associated with these practice guidelines. Patients who underwent resection of adrenocortical carcinoma from 1993 to 2014 at the 13 academic institutions of the US Adrenocortical Carcinoma Group were included. Factors associated with mitotane administration were determined. Primary end points were recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Of 207 patients, 88 (43%) received adjuvant mitotane. Receipt of mitotane was associated with hormonal secretion (58% vs 32%; p = 0.001), advanced TNM stage (stage IV: 42% vs 23%; p = 0.021), adjuvant chemotherapy (37% vs 5%; p < 0.001), and adjuvant radiation (17% vs 5%; p = 0.01), but was not associated with tumor rupture, margin status, or N-stage. Median follow-up was 44 months. Adjuvant mitotane was associated with decreased RFS (10.0 vs 27.9 months; p = 0.007) and OS (31.7 vs 58.9 months; p = 0.006). On multivariable analysis, mitotane was not independently associated with RFS or OS, and margin status, advanced TNM stage, and receipt of chemotherapy were associated with survival. After excluding all patients who received chemotherapy, adjuvant mitotane remained associated with decreased RFS and similar OS; multivariable analyses again showed no association with recurrence or survival. Stage-specific analyses in both cohorts revealed no association between adjuvant mitotane and improved RFS or OS. When accounting for stage and adverse tumor and treatment-related factors, adjuvant mitotane after resection of adrenocortical carcinoma is not associated with improved RFS or OS.

Novel targeted therapies in adrenocortical carcinoma.,"Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",Curr Opin Endocrinol Diabetes Obes,2016-06-01,"Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare cancer, but one that carries a poor prognosis due to its aggressive nature and unresponsiveness to conventional chemotherapeutic strategies. Over the past 12 years, there has been renewed interest in developing new therapies for this cancer, including identifying key signaling nodes responsible for cell proliferation. Clinical trials of tyrosine kinase inhibitors as monotherapy have generally been disappointing, although the identification of exceptional responders may lead to the identification of targeted therapies that may produce responses in subsets of patients. Agents targeted to the Wnt signaling pathway, a known player in adrenal carcinogenesis, have been developed, although they have not yet been used specifically for adrenal cancer. There is current excitement about inhibitors of acetyl-coA cholesterol acetyl transferase 1, an enzyme required for intracellular cholesterol handling, although trials are still underway. Tools to target other proteins such as Steroidogenic Factor 1 and mechanistic target of rapamycin have been developed and are moving towards clinical application.

Genome wide DNA copy-number analysis revealed frequent occurrence of massive DNA loss followed by whole-genome doubling (WGD), which was associated with aggressive clinical course, suggesting WGD is a hallmark of disease progression. Corroborating this hypothesis were increased TERT expression, decreased telomere length, and activation of cell-cycle programs.

Prognostic Significance of Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II Expression in Pediatric Adrenocortical Tumors: A St. Jude and Children's Oncology Group Study.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2016-06-15,"Histologic markers that differentiate benign and malignant pediatric adrenocortical tumors are lacking. Previous studies have implicated an association of MHC class II expression with adrenocortical tumor prognosis. Here, we determined the expression of MHC class II as well as the cell of origin of these immunologic markers in pediatric adrenocortical tumor. The impact of MHC class II gene expression on outcome was determined in a cohort of uniformly treated children with adrenocortical carcinomas. We analyzed the expression of MHC class II and a selected cluster of differentiation genes in 63 pediatric adrenocortical tumors by Affymetrix Human U133 Plus 2.0 or HT HG-U133+PM gene chip analyses. Cells expressing MHC class II were identified by morphologic and immunohistochemical assays. MHC class II expression was significantly greater in adrenocortical adenomas than in carcinomas (P = 4.8 ×10<sup>-6</sup>) and was associated with a higher progression-free survival (PFS) estimate (P = 0.003). Specifically, HLA-DPA1 expression was most significantly associated with PFS after adjustment for tumor weight and stage. HLA-DPA1 was predominantly expressed by hematopoietic infiltrating cells and undetectable in tumor cells in 23 of 26 cases (88%). MHC class II expression, which is produced by tumor-infiltrating immune cells, is an indicator of disease aggressiveness in pediatric adrenocortical tumor. Our results suggest that immune responses modulate adrenocortical tumorigenesis and may allow the refinement of risk stratification and treatment for this disease.

Clinical, pathologic, and outcome data were compared between the 2 groups. Of 120 patients who met inclusion criteria from 1993 to 2014, 32 (27 %) underwent lymphadenectomy. Factors associated with lymphadenectomy were tumor size (12 vs. 9.5 cm; p = .007), palpable mass at presentation (26 vs. 12 %; p = .07), suspicious lymph nodes on preoperative imaging (44 vs. 7 %; p < .001), and need for multivisceral resection (78 vs. 36 %; p < .001). Median number of lymph nodes harvested was higher in the lymphadenectomy group (5.5 vs. 0; p < .001).

Clinical Score Predicting Long-Term Survival after Repeat Resection for Recurrent Adrenocortical Carcinoma.,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,J. Am. Coll. Surg.,2016-09-13,"Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is an aggressive malignancy typically resistant to chemotherapy and radiation. Surgery, even in the setting of locally recurrent or metastatic disease, remains the only potentially curative option. However, the subset of patients who will benefit from repeat resection in this setting remains ill defined. The objective of this study was to propose a prognostic clinical score that facilitates selection of patients for repeat resection of recurrent ACC. Patients who underwent curative-intent repeat resection for recurrent ACC at 1 of 13 academic medical centers participating in the US ACC Study Group were identified. End points included morbidity, mortality, and overall survival. Fifty-six patients underwent repeat curative-intent resection for recurrent ACC (representing 21% of 265 patients who underwent resection for primary ACC) from 1997 to 2014. Median age was 52 years. Sites of resected recurrence included locoregional only (54%), lung only (14%), liver only (12%), combined locoregional and lung (4%), combined liver and lung (4%), and other distant sites (12%). Thirty-day morbidity and mortality rates were 40% and 5.4%, respectively. Cox regression analysis revealed that the presence of multifocal recurrence, disease-free interval <12 months, and extrapulmonary distant metastases were independent predictors of poor survival. A clinical score consisting of 1-point each for the 3 variables demonstrated good discrimination in predicting survival after repeat resection (5-year: 72% for 0 points, 32% for 1 point, 0% for 2 or 3 points; p = 0.0006, area under the curve = 0.78).

Actual 10-year survivors following resection of adrenocortical carcinoma.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2016-09-16,"Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare and aggressive malignancy with limited therapeutic options beyond surgical resection. The characteristics of actual long-term survivors following surgical resection for ACC have not been previously reported. Patients who underwent resection for ACC at one of 13 academic institutions participating in the US Adrenocortical Carcinoma Group from 1993 to 2014 were analyzed. Patients were stratified into four groups: early mortality (died within 2 years), late mortality (died within 2-5 years), actual 5-year survivor (survived at least 5 years), and actual 10-year survivor (survived at least 10 years). Patients with less than 5 years of follow-up were excluded. Among the 180 patients available for analysis, there were 49 actual 5-year survivors (27%) and 12 actual 10-year survivors (7%). Patients who experienced early mortality had higher rates of cortisol-secreting tumors, nodal metastasis, synchronous distant metastasis, and R1 or R2 resections (all P < 0.05). The need for multi-visceral resection, perioperative blood transfusion, and adjuvant therapy correlated with early mortality. However, nodal involvement, distant metastasis, and R1 resection did not preclude patients from becoming actual 10-year survivors. Ten of twelve actual 10-year survivors were women, and of the seven 10-year survivors who experienced disease recurrence, five had undergone repeat surgery to resect the recurrence. Surgery for ACC can offer a 1 in 4 chance of actual 5-year survival and a 1 in 15 chance of actual 10-year survival.

Curative Surgical Resection of Adrenocortical Carcinoma: Determining Long-term Outcome Based on Conditional Disease-free Probability.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2017-01-01,"To evaluate conditional disease-free survival (CDFS) for patients who underwent curative intent surgery for adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). ACC is a rare but aggressive tumor. Survival estimates are usually reported as survival from the time of surgery. CDFS estimates may be more clinically relevant by accounting for the changing likelihood of disease-free survival (DFS) according to time elapsed after surgery. CDFS was assessed using a multi-institutional cohort of patients. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate factors associated with DFS. Three-year CDFS (CDFS3) estimates at ""x"" year after surgery were calculated as follows: CDFS3 = DFS(x+3)/DFS(x). One hundred ninety-two patients were included in the study cohort; median patient age was 52 years. On presentation, 36% of patients had a functional tumor and median size was 11.5 cm. Most patients underwent R0 resection (75%) and 9% had N1 disease. Overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year DFS was 59%, 34%, and 22%, respectively. Using CDFS estimates, the probability of remaining disease free for an additional 3 years given that the patient had survived without disease at 1, 3, and 5 years, was 43%, 53%, and 70%, respectively. Patients with less favorable prognosis at baseline demonstrated the greatest increase in CDFS3 over time (eg, capsular invasion: 28%-88%, Δ60% vs no capsular invasion: 51%-87%, Δ36%).

Complete Responses to Mitotane in Metastatic Adrenocortical Carcinoma-A New Look at an Old Drug.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2017-05-30,"Based largely on reports that predate modern reporting standards, mitotane has been considered a systemic treatment option for both hormone control and antitumor control of metastatic adrenocortical cancer (ACC), although the therapeutic window is narrow. We searched electronic medical records to identify patients with metastatic ACC treated and prescribed single-agent mitotane at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from March 15, 1989-September 18, 2015. Reference radiologists reviewed all imaging and determined efficacy according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1. Patient demographics, toxicities, and treatment outcomes were reviewed. Next-generation sequencing was performed in selected cases. Thirty-six patients were identified. The mean age was 54 and 50% had functional tumors. Grade 3 or greater toxicities were documented in 16 out of 36 patients (44%) and 17% had documented long term adrenal insufficiency. Progression of the disease as the best response occurred in 30 out of 36 patients (83%) and one patient (3%) experienced clinical progression. Three patients achieved a complete response (CR) (8%), one patient achieved a partial response (3%), and one patient (3%) had stable disease after slow disease progression prior to initiation of therapy (durable for 6 months). All responders had nonfunctional tumors. Next-generation sequencing in two of the three CR patients was performed and failed to identify any novel alterations. In this retrospective series, mitotane had a low response rate and low tumor control rate; however, a disproportionately high complete response rate suggested it should be used in selected individuals. Adrenal insufficiency is common with mitotane use and aggressive treatment with steroid supplementation should be considered when appropriate to avoid excess toxicities.

Blood Transfusion and Survival for Resected Adrenocortical Carcinoma: A Study from the United States Adrenocortical Carcinoma Group.,The American surgeon,Am Surg,2017-07-01,"Perioperative blood transfusion is associated with decreased survival in pancreatic, gastric, and liver cancer. The effect of transfusion in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) has not been studied. Patients with available transfusion data undergoing curative-intent resection of ACC from 1993 to 2014 at 13 institutions comprising the United States Adrenocortical Carcinoma Group were included. Factors associated with blood transfusion were determined. Primary and secondary end points were recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS), respectively. Out of 265 patients, 149 were included for analysis. Out of these, 57 patients (38.3%) received perioperative transfusions. Compared to nontransfused patients, transfused patients more commonly had stage 4 disease (46% vs 24%, P = 0.01), larger tumors (15.8 vs 10.2 cm, P < 0.001), inferior vena cava involvement (24.6% vs 5.4%, P = 0.002), additional organ resection (78.9% vs 36.3%, P < 0.001), and major complications (29% vs 2%, P < 0.001). Transfusion was associated with decreased RFS (8.9 vs 24.7 months, P = 0.006) and OS (22.8 vs 91.0 months, P < 0.001). On univariate Cox regression, transfusion, stage IV, hormonal hypersecretion, and adjuvant therapy were associated with decreased RFS. On multivariable analysis, only transfusion [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) =1.0-2.9, P = 0.04], stage IV (HR = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.7-5.9, P < 0.001), and hormonal hypersecretion (HR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.5-4.2, P < 0.001) were associated with worse RFS. When applying this model to OS, similar associations were seen (transfusion HR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.1-3.8, P = 0.02; stage 4 HR = 6.2, 95% CI = 3.1-12.4, P < 0.001; hormonal hypersecretion HR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.9-6.4, P < 0.001). There was no difference in outcomes between patients who received 1 to 2 units versus >2 units of packed red blood cells in median RFS (8.9 vs 8.4 months, P = 0.95) or OS (26.5 vs 18.6 months, P = 0.63).

Identification of Clinical and Biologic Correlates Associated With Outcome in Children With Adrenocortical Tumors Without Germline TP53 Mutations: A St Jude Adrenocortical Tumor Registry and Children's Oncology Group Study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2017-10-23,"Purpose The clinical features, pathogenesis, and outcomes in children with adrenocortical tumors (ACTs) without germline TP53 mutations have not been systematically studied. Herein, we describe these correlates and analyze their association with outcome. Patients and Methods Genomic DNA was analyzed for TP53, CTNNB1, CDKN1C, ATRX, and chromosome 11p15 abnormalities. β-catenin expression and Ki-67 labeling index (LI) were evaluated by immunostaining. Primary end points were progression-free (PFS) and overall survival. Results Median age of 42 girls and 18 boys was 3.3 years (range, 0.25 to 21.7 years). Complete resection (stages I and II) was achieved in 32 patients, and 28 patients had stage III or IV disease. Constitutional abnormalities of chromosome 11p15 occurred in nine of 40 patients, with six patients not showing phenotype of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Three-year PFS and overall survival for all patients were 71.4% and 80.5%, respectively. In single-predictor Cox regression analysis, age, disease stage, tumor weight, somatic TP53 mutations, and Ki-67 LI were associated with prognosis. Ki-67 LI and age remained significantly associated with PFS after adjusting for stage and tumor weight. Three-year PFS for 27 patients with Ki-67 LI ≥ 15% was 48.5% compared with 96.2% for 29 patients with Ki-67 LI < 15% (log-rank P = .002), and the rate of relapse increased by 24% with each 1-year increase in age at diagnosis (hazard ratio, 1.24; P = .0057).

A Novel T-Stage Classification System for Adrenocortical Carcinoma: Proposal from the US Adrenocortical Carcinoma Study Group.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2017-11-21,"The 7th AJCC T-stage system for adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), based on size and extra-adrenal invasion, does not adequately stratify patients by survival. Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) is a known poor prognostic factor. We propose a novel T-stage system that incorporates LVI to better risk-stratify patients undergoing resection for ACC. Patients undergoing curative-intent resections for ACC from 1993 to 2014 at 13 institutions comprising the US ACC Group were included. Primary outcome was disease-specific survival (DSS). Of the 265 patients with ACC, 149 were included for analysis. The current T-stage system failed to differentiate patients with T2 versus T3 disease (p = 0.10). Presence of LVI was associated with worse DSS versus no LVI (36 mo vs. 168 mo; p = 0.001). After accounting for the individual components of the current T-stage system (size, extra-adrenal invasion), LVI remained a poor prognostic factor on multivariable analysis (hazard ratio 2.14, 95% confidence interval 1.05-4.38, p = 0.04). LVI positivity further stratified patients with T2 and T3 disease (T2: 37 mo vs. median not reached; T3: 36 mo vs. 96 mo; p = 0.03) but did not influence survival in patients with T1 or T4 disease. By incorporating LVI, a new T-stage classification system was created: [T1: ≤ 5 cm, (-)local invasion, (+/-)LVI; T2: > 5 cm, (-)local invasion, (-)LVI OR any size, (+)local invasion, (-)LVI; T3: > 5 cm, (-)local invasion, (+)LVI OR any size, (+)local invasion, (+)LVI; T4: any size, (+)adjacent organ invasion, (+/-)LVI]. Each progressive new T-stage group was associated with worse median DSS (T1: 167 mo; T2: 96 mo; T3: 37 mo; T4: 15 mo; p < 0.001). Compared with the current T-stage system, the proposed T-stage system, which incorporates LVI, better differentiates T2 and T3 disease and accurately stratifies patients by disease-specific survival. If externally validated, this T-stage classification should be considered for future AJCC staging systems.",Journal Article,791.0,8.0,The 7th AJCC T-stage system for carcinoma ACC based on size and extra-adrenal invasion does not adequately stratify patients by survival Lymphovascular invasion LVI is a known poor prognostic factor We propose a novel T-stage system that incorporates LVI to better risk-stratify patients undergoing resection for ACC Patients undergoing curative-intent resections for ACC from 1993 to 2014 at 13 institutions comprising the US ACC Group were included Primary outcome was disease-specific survival DSS Of the 265 patients with ACC 149 were included for analysis The current T-stage system failed to differentiate patients with T2 versus T3 disease p 0.10 Presence of LVI was associated with worse DSS versus no LVI 36 mo vs. 168 mo p 0.001 After accounting for the individual components of the current T-stage system size extra-adrenal invasion LVI remained a poor prognostic factor on multivariable analysis hazard ratio 2.14 95 confidence interval 1.05-4.38 p 0.04 LVI positivity further stratified patients with T2 and T3 disease T2 37 mo vs. median not reached T3 36 mo vs. 96 mo p 0.03 but did not influence survival in patients with T1 or T4 disease By incorporating LVI a new T-stage classification system was created T1 ≤ 5 cm local invasion +/- LVI T2 5 cm local invasion LVI OR any size local invasion LVI T3 5 cm local invasion LVI OR any size local invasion LVI T4 any size adjacent organ invasion +/- LVI Each progressive new T-stage group was associated with worse median DSS T1 167 mo T2 96 mo T3 37 mo T4 15 mo p 0.001 Compared with the current T-stage system the proposed T-stage system which incorporates LVI better differentiates T2 and T3 disease and accurately stratifies patients by disease-specific survival If externally validated this T-stage classification should be considered for future AJCC staging systems,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 7283, 2271, 102, 82, 398, 9, 134, 3267, 90, 23, 444, 2, 3420, 2987, 578, 1097, 44, 4215, 3570, 7, 20, 25, 2933, 578, 3327, 16, 8, 440, 334, 177, 161, 21, 2548, 8, 229, 102, 82, 398, 17, 6175, 3327, 6, 380, 43, 3570, 7, 479, 170, 9, 3267, 7, 479, 1075, 1697, 2185, 9, 3267, 29, 3343, 6, 1409, 28, 233, 1764, 3538, 3, 843, 3267, 87, 11, 159, 86, 228, 10, 34, 112, 25, 1788, 1, 3, 7298, 7, 5, 3267, 4928, 11, 159, 9, 65, 3, 291, 102, 82, 398, 1551, 6, 3723, 7, 5, 1786, 185, 2065, 34, 19, 13, 79, 463, 1, 3327, 10, 41, 5, 639, 1788, 185, 77, 3327, 511, 2035, 105, 5359, 2035, 19, 13, 144, 50, 3116, 9, 3, 797, 1628, 1, 3, 291, 102, 82, 398, 444, 3420, 2987, 578, 3327, 958, 8, 334, 177, 161, 23, 658, 65, 360, 197, 18, 213, 48, 307, 268, 14, 474, 39, 519, 19, 13, 755, 3327, 1887, 195, 1173, 7, 5, 1786, 2, 2065, 34, 1786, 567, 2035, 105, 52, 44, 1300, 2065, 511, 2035, 105, 921, 2035, 19, 13, 680, 84, 205, 44, 1054, 25, 4, 7, 5, 1534, 15, 2463, 34, 20, 2570, 3327, 8, 217, 102, 82, 947, 398, 10, 2466, 1534, 1552, 33, 494, 293, 578, 3327, 1786, 33, 494, 293, 578, 3327, 15, 500, 444, 293, 578, 3327, 2065, 33, 494, 293, 578, 3327, 15, 500, 444, 293, 578, 3327, 2463, 500, 444, 2086, 1259, 578, 3327, 296, 1014, 217, 102, 82, 87, 10, 41, 5, 639, 52, 1788, 1534, 5431, 2035, 1786, 921, 2035, 2065, 567, 2035, 2463, 167, 2035, 19, 13, 144, 72, 5, 3, 291, 102, 82, 398, 3, 1587, 102, 82, 398, 92, 6175, 3327, 380, 19728, 1786, 2, 2065, 34, 2, 2141, 12391, 7, 20, 34, 112, 25, 492, 7753, 938, 26, 102, 82, 947, 257, 40, 515, 9, 508, 2271, 632, 1530]",1834.0,29164414,58
Laparoscopic Versus Open Adrenalectomy for Localized/Locally Advanced Primary Adrenocortical Carcinoma (ENSAT I-III) in Adults: Is Margin-Free Resection the Key Surgical Factor that Dictates Outcome? A Review of the Literature.,Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques. Part A,J Laparoendosc Adv Surg Tech A,2018-01-10,"The aim of this study was to review the current literature on the role of laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) in the treatment of primary adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC; European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors [ENSAT] I-III) in adults. Nonrandomized controlled trials published between January 1999 and February 2017 were identified by searching the Pubmed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases. Primary and secondary endpoints included surgical and pathological parameters (patients age, tumor size, ENSAT stage, type of surgical approach, and period of follow-up), surgical outcomes (operative time, estimated blood loss, length of hospital stay, conversion rate to laparotomy, R0 resection, and surgical margin's status), and oncological outcomes (rate of recurrence, disease-free survival [DFS], and overall survival [OS] rates). A total of 13 studies encompassing data on 1171 patients were included in the review. Compared with open approach, LA demonstrated lower tumor size, shorter operative time, lower intraoperative blood loss, shorter postoperative hospital stay, and equivalent local recurrence rates. No significant differences were observed between groups treated with an open or laparoscopic approach for the following criteria: R0 surgical resection status, tumor overall recurrence, and postoperative DFS and OS rates. LA appears to be equivalent to open method for localized/locally advanced primary ACC (ENSAT I-III) in terms of R0 resection rate, overall recurrence, DFS, and OS, therefore suggesting that the extent of surgery with adequate tumor resection is the predominant endpoint, rather than the surgical approach itself.

Development of new preclinical models to advance adrenocortical carcinoma research.,Endocrine-related cancer,Endocr. Relat. Cancer,2018-01-25,"Adrenocortical cancer (ACC) is an orphan malignancy that results in heterogeneous clinical phenotypes and molecular genotypes. There are no curative treatments for this deadly cancer with 35% survival at five years. Our understanding of the underlying pathobiology and our ability to test novel therapeutic targets has been limited due to the lack of preclinical models. Here, we report the establishment of two new ACC cell lines and corresponding patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. CU-ACC1 cell line and PDX were derived from a perinephric metastasis in a patient whose primary tumor secreted aldosterone. CU-ACC2 cell line and PDX were derived from a liver metastasis in a patient with Lynch syndrome. Short tandem repeat profiling confirmed consistent matches between human samples and models. Both exomic and RNA sequencing profiling were performed on the patient samples and the models, and hormonal secretion was evaluated in the new cell lines. RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry confirmed the expression of adrenal cortex markers in the PDXs and human tumors. The new cell lines replicate two of the known genetic models of ACC. CU-ACC1 cells had a mutation in <i>CTNNB1</i> and secreted cortisol but not aldosterone.

Elucidating the Role of the Maternal Embryonic Leucine Zipper Kinase in Adrenocortical Carcinoma.,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,2018-07-01,"Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is an aggressive cancer with a 5-year survival rate <35%. Mortality remains high due to lack of targeted therapies. Using bioinformatic analyses, we identified maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) as 4.1-fold overexpressed in ACC compared with normal adrenal samples. High MELK expression in human tumors correlated with shorter survival and with increased expression of genes involved in cell division and growth. We investigated the functional effects of MELK inhibition using newly developed ACC cell lines with variable MELK expression, CU-ACC1 and CU-ACC2, compared with H295R cells. In vitro treatment with the MELK inhibitor, OTSSP167, resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in rates of cell proliferation, colony formation, and cell survival, with relative sensitivity of each ACC cell line based upon the level of MELK overexpression. To confirm a MELK-specific antitumorigenic effect, MELK was inhibited in H295R cells via multiple short hairpin RNAs. MELK silencing resulted in 1.9-fold decrease in proliferation, and 3- to 10-fold decrease in colony formation in soft agar and clonogenicity assays, respectively. In addition, although MELK silencing had no effect on survival in normoxia, exposure to a hypoxia resulted in a sixfold and eightfold increase in apoptosis as assessed by caspase-3 activation and TUNEL, respectively. Together these data suggest that MELK is a modulator of tumor cell growth and survival in a hypoxic microenvironment in adrenal cancer cells and support future investigation of its role as a therapeutic kinase target in patients with ACC.",Journal Article,569.0,8.0,carcinoma ACC is an aggressive cancer with a 5-year survival rate 35 Mortality remains high due to lack of targeted therapies Using bioinformatic analyses we identified maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase MELK as 4.1-fold overexpressed in ACC compared with normal adrenal samples High MELK expression in human tumors correlated with shorter survival and with increased expression of genes involved in cell division and growth We investigated the functional effects of MELK inhibition using newly developed ACC cell lines with variable MELK expression CU-ACC1 and CU-ACC2 compared with H295R cells In vitro treatment with the MELK inhibitor OTSSP167 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in rates of cell proliferation colony formation and cell survival with relative sensitivity of each ACC cell line based upon the level of MELK overexpression To confirm a MELK-specific antitumorigenic effect MELK was inhibited in H295R cells via multiple short hairpin RNAs MELK silencing resulted in 1.9-fold decrease in proliferation and 3- to 10-fold decrease in colony formation in soft agar and clonogenicity assays respectively In addition although MELK silencing had no effect on survival in normoxia exposure to a hypoxia resulted in a sixfold and eightfold increase in apoptosis as assessed by caspase-3 activation and TUNEL respectively Together these data suggest that MELK is a modulator of tumor cell growth and survival in a hypoxic microenvironment in adrenal cancer cells and support future investigation of its role as a therapeutic kinase target in patients with ACC,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[134, 3267, 16, 35, 571, 12, 5, 8, 33, 111, 25, 116, 465, 282, 469, 64, 520, 6, 926, 1, 238, 235, 75, 10121, 318, 21, 108, 6039, 5390, 10316, 19564, 216, 11223, 22, 39, 14, 1116, 1711, 4, 3267, 72, 5, 295, 2987, 347, 64, 11223, 55, 4, 171, 57, 438, 5, 985, 25, 2, 5, 101, 55, 1, 214, 646, 4, 31, 5750, 2, 129, 21, 565, 3, 583, 176, 1, 11223, 297, 75, 732, 276, 3267, 31, 285, 5, 1347, 11223, 55, 6119, 22935, 2, 6119, 32655, 72, 5, 35244, 37, 4, 439, 24, 5, 3, 11223, 230, 72831, 627, 4, 8, 61, 470, 775, 4, 151, 1, 31, 457, 1975, 1264, 2, 31, 25, 5, 580, 485, 1, 296, 3267, 31, 328, 90, 1548, 3, 301, 1, 11223, 851, 6, 1843, 8, 11223, 112, 15958, 254, 11223, 10, 879, 4, 35244, 37, 847, 232, 978, 5957, 4550, 11223, 2077, 627, 4, 14, 83, 1116, 775, 4, 457, 2, 27, 6, 79, 1116, 775, 4, 1975, 1264, 4, 1214, 7491, 2, 9880, 1013, 106, 4, 352, 242, 11223, 2077, 42, 77, 254, 23, 25, 4, 20448, 645, 6, 8, 1823, 627, 4, 8, 22121, 2, 26181, 344, 4, 351, 22, 275, 20, 1469, 27, 363, 2, 8159, 106, 1162, 46, 74, 309, 17, 11223, 16, 8, 6318, 1, 30, 31, 129, 2, 25, 4, 8, 4744, 995, 4, 2987, 12, 37, 2, 538, 508, 940, 1, 211, 200, 22, 8, 189, 216, 283, 4, 7, 5, 3267]",1576.0,29790920,49

Role of indo-cyanine green (ICG) fluorescence in laparoscopic adrenalectomy: a retrospective review of 55 Cases.,Surgical endoscopy,Surg Endosc,2018-06-25,"Indo-Cyanine Green Fluorescence is an emerging technology with more frequent use in laparoscopic and robotic surgery. It relies on near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence to demonstrate tissue perfusion with demarcation of tissue planes and vascular pedicles. The aim of the study is to evaluate the role of this technology in laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA). 55 patients underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy using NIR Fluorescence enabled laparoscope. All cases received a standard initial dose of 5-mg dye to aid tissue visualization. Surgery proceeded with ""fluorescence mode"" demonstrating real-time NIR images superimposed on standard white-light imaging. The timing, number of doses were dictated by the operating surgeon, which were recorded and correlated with intra-operative fluorescence visualization. 54 patients underwent successful LA, with one conversion in a case of large pheochromocytoma due to difficult hemostasis. The lag between ICG administration and visualization of adrenal fluorescence varied between 30 and 75 s. The total duration of adrenal parenchymal fluorescence after a single dose did not exceed 15 min in our series. Average total administered dose was 14.4 mg. We suffered no mortality. There were no adverse effects due to the dye. 5 patients suffered Grade I complications, with one patient suffering Grade II and IV complication each, as per Clavien-Dindo Classification.

Microsatellite Instability Is Associated With the Presence of Lynch Syndrome Pan-Cancer.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2018-10-30,"Microsatellite instability (MSI) and/or mismatch repair deficiency (MMR-D) testing has traditionally been performed in patients with colorectal (CRC) and endometrial cancer (EC) to screen for Lynch syndrome (LS)-associated cancer predisposition. The recent success of immunotherapy in high-frequency MSI (MSI-H) and/or MMR-D tumors now supports testing for MSI in all advanced solid tumors. The extent to which LS accounts for MSI-H across heterogeneous tumor types is unknown. Here, we establish the prevalence of LS across solid tumors according to MSI status. MSI status was determined using targeted next-generation sequencing, with tumors classified as MSI-H, MSI-indeterminate, or microsatellite-stable. Matched germline DNA was analyzed for mutations in LS-associated mismatch repair genes ( MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, EPCAM). In patients with LS with MSI-H/I tumors, immunohistochemical staining for MMR-D was assessed. Among 15,045 unique patients (more than 50 cancer types), LS was identified in 16.3% (53 of 326), 1.9% (13 of 699), and 0.3% (37 of 14,020) of patients with MSI-H, MSI-indeterminate, and microsatellite-stable tumors, respectively ( P < .001). Among patients with LS with MSI-H/I tumors, 50% (33 of 66) had tumors other than CRC/EC, including urothelial, prostate, pancreas, adrenocortical, small bowel, sarcoma, mesothelioma, melanoma, gastric, and germ cell tumors. In these patients with non-CRC/EC tumors, 45% (15 of 33) did not meet LS genetic testing criteria on the basis of personal/family history. Immunohistochemical staining of LS-positive MSI-H/I tumors demonstrated MMR-D in 98.2% (56 of 57) of available cases. MSI-H/MMR-D is predictive of LS across a much broader tumor spectrum than currently appreciated. Given implications for cancer surveillance and prevention measures in affected families, these data support germline genetic assessment for LS for patients with an MSI-H/MMR-D tumor, regardless of cancer type or family cancer history.",Journal Article,448.0,27.0,"Microsatellite instability MSI and/or mismatch repair deficiency MMR-D testing has traditionally been performed in patients with CRC and cancer EC to screen for Lynch syndrome LS -associated cancer predisposition The recent success of immunotherapy in high-frequency MSI MSI-H and/or MMR-D tumors now supports testing for MSI in all advanced solid tumors The extent to which LS accounts for MSI-H across heterogeneous tumor types is unknown Here we establish the prevalence of LS across solid tumors according to MSI status MSI status was determined using targeted next-generation sequencing with tumors classified as MSI-H MSI-indeterminate or microsatellite-stable Matched germline DNA was analyzed for mutations in LS-associated mismatch repair genes MLH1 MSH2 MSH6 PMS2 EPCAM In patients with LS with MSI-H/I tumors immunohistochemical staining for MMR-D was assessed Among 15,045 unique patients more than 50 cancer types LS was identified in 16.3 53 of 326 1.9 13 of 699 and 0.3 37 of 14,020 of patients with MSI-H MSI-indeterminate and microsatellite-stable tumors respectively P .001 Among patients with LS with MSI-H/I tumors 50 33 of 66 had tumors other than CRC/EC including urothelial small bowel and germ cell tumors In these patients with non-CRC/EC tumors 45 15 of 33 did not meet LS genetic testing criteria on the basis of personal/family history Immunohistochemical staining of LS-positive MSI-H/I tumors demonstrated MMR-D in 98.2 56 of 57 of available cases MSI-H/MMR-D is predictive of LS across a much broader tumor spectrum than currently appreciated Given implications for cancer surveillance and prevention measures in affected families these data support germline genetic assessment for LS for patients with an MSI-H/MMR-D tumor regardless of cancer type or family cancer history",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2226, 1753, 1494, 2, 15, 2617, 972, 2299, 2205, 427, 471, 71, 4206, 85, 173, 4, 7, 5, 590, 2, 12, 2180, 6, 2413, 9, 3546, 681, 3153, 41, 12, 2863, 3, 435, 1825, 1, 726, 4, 64, 675, 1494, 1494, 555, 2, 15, 2205, 427, 57, 1134, 2304, 471, 9, 1494, 4, 62, 131, 537, 57, 3, 1039, 6, 92, 3153, 4162, 9, 1494, 555, 716, 1564, 30, 630, 16, 860, 467, 21, 1811, 3, 1078, 1, 3153, 716, 537, 57, 768, 6, 1494, 156, 1494, 156, 10, 509, 75, 238, 1305, 914, 615, 5, 57, 1373, 22, 1494, 555, 1494, 5167, 15, 2226, 585, 655, 1009, 261, 10, 311, 9, 138, 4, 3153, 41, 2617, 972, 214, 3321, 4272, 5176, 7300, 6820, 4, 7, 5, 3153, 5, 1494, 555, 70, 57, 1382, 1029, 9, 2205, 427, 10, 275, 107, 167, 4918, 991, 7, 80, 76, 212, 12, 630, 3153, 10, 108, 4, 245, 27, 699, 1, 9588, 14, 83, 233, 1, 14243, 2, 13, 27, 567, 1, 213, 5743, 1, 7, 5, 1494, 555, 1494, 5167, 2, 2226, 585, 57, 106, 19, 144, 107, 7, 5, 3153, 5, 1494, 555, 70, 57, 212, 466, 1, 700, 42, 57, 127, 76, 590, 2180, 141, 1472, 302, 1659, 2, 2280, 31, 57, 4, 46, 7, 5, 220, 590, 2180, 57, 512, 167, 1, 466, 205, 44, 3362, 3153, 336, 471, 371, 23, 3, 877, 1, 3008, 607, 532, 1382, 1029, 1, 3153, 109, 1494, 555, 70, 57, 264, 2205, 427, 4, 1096, 18, 664, 1, 696, 1, 390, 140, 1494, 555, 2205, 427, 16, 464, 1, 3153, 716, 8, 1802, 5410, 30, 1873, 76, 694, 7292, 447, 1268, 9, 12, 617, 2, 1070, 1018, 4, 1424, 1954, 46, 74, 538, 1009, 336, 455, 9, 3153, 9, 7, 5, 35, 1494, 555, 2205, 427, 30, 1583, 1, 12, 267, 15, 607, 12, 532]",1805.0,30376427,3
