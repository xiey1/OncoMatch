"Comparison of digital rectal examination and serum prostate specific antigen in the early detection of prostate cancer: results of a multicenter clinical trial of 6,630 men.",The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,1994-05-01,"To compare the efficacy of digital rectal examination and serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the early detection of prostate cancer, we conducted a prospective clinical trial at 6 university centers of 6,630 male volunteers 50 years old or older who underwent PSA determination (Hybritech Tandem-E or Tandem-R assays) and digital rectal examination. Quadrant biopsies were performed if the PSA level was greater than 4 micrograms/l or digital rectal examination was suspicious, even if transrectal ultrasonography revealed no areas suspicious for cancer. The results showed that 15% of the men had a PSA level of greater than 4 micrograms/l, 15% had a suspicious digital rectal examination and 26% had suspicious findings on either or both tests. Of 1,167 biopsies performed cancer was detected in 264. PSA detected significantly more tumors (82%, 216 of 264 cancers) than digital rectal examination (55%, 146 of 264, p = 0.001). The cancer detection rate was 3.2% for digital rectal examination, 4.6% for PSA and 5.8% for the 2 methods combined. Positive predictive value was 32% for PSA and 21% for digital rectal examination. Of 160 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and pathological staging 114 (71%) had organ confined cancer: PSA detected 85 (75%) and digital rectal examination detected 64 (56%, p = 0.003). Use of the 2 methods in combination increased detection of organ confined disease by 78% (50 of 64 cases) over digital rectal examination alone. If the performance of a biopsy would have required suspicious transrectal ultrasonography findings, nearly 40% of the tumors would have been missed. We conclude that the use of PSA in conjunction with digital rectal examination enhances early prostate cancer detection. Prostatic biopsy should be considered if either the PSA level is greater than 4 micrograms/l or digital rectal examination is suspicious for cancer, even in the absence of abnormal transrectal ultrasonography findings.",Clinical Trial,9396.0,1218.0,"To compare the efficacy of digital examination and serum specific antigen PSA in the early detection of cancer we conducted a prospective clinical trial at 6 university centers of 6,630 male volunteers 50 years old or older who underwent PSA determination Hybritech Tandem-E or Tandem-R assays and digital examination Quadrant biopsies were performed if the PSA level was greater than 4 micrograms/l or digital examination was suspicious even if transrectal ultrasonography revealed no areas suspicious for cancer The results showed that 15 of the men had a PSA level of greater than 4 micrograms/l 15 had a suspicious digital examination and 26 had suspicious findings on either or both tests Of 1,167 biopsies performed cancer was detected in 264 PSA detected significantly more tumors 82 216 of 264 cancers than digital examination 55 146 of 264 p 0.001 The cancer detection rate was 3.2 for digital examination 4.6 for PSA and 5.8 for the 2 methods combined Positive predictive value was 32 for PSA and 21 for digital examination Of 160 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and pathological staging 114 71 had organ confined cancer PSA detected 85 75 and digital examination detected 64 56 p 0.003 Use of the 2 methods in combination increased detection of organ confined disease by 78 50 of 64 cases over digital examination alone If the performance of a biopsy would have required suspicious transrectal ultrasonography findings nearly 40 of the tumors would have been missed We conclude that the use of PSA in conjunction with digital examination enhances early cancer detection Prostatic biopsy should be considered if either the PSA level is greater than 4 micrograms/l or digital examination is suspicious for cancer even in the absence of abnormal transrectal ultrasonography findings",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[6, 932, 3, 209, 1, 3271, 1385, 2, 524, 112, 448, 534, 4, 3, 191, 638, 1, 12, 21, 426, 8, 482, 38, 160, 28, 49, 1652, 1168, 1, 49, 10939, 1045, 5495, 212, 60, 1095, 15, 434, 54, 208, 534, 3104, 27830, 2905, 563, 15, 2905, 668, 1013, 2, 3271, 1385, 8832, 1154, 11, 173, 492, 3, 534, 301, 10, 378, 76, 39, 21929, 805, 15, 3271, 1385, 10, 3230, 871, 492, 9409, 4244, 553, 77, 1361, 3230, 9, 12, 3, 99, 224, 17, 167, 1, 3, 325, 42, 8, 534, 301, 1, 378, 76, 39, 21929, 805, 167, 42, 8, 3230, 3271, 1385, 2, 432, 42, 3230, 272, 23, 361, 15, 110, 895, 1, 14, 5431, 1154, 173, 12, 10, 530, 4, 6528, 534, 530, 97, 80, 57, 878, 6287, 1, 6528, 163, 76, 3271, 1385, 614, 4909, 1, 6528, 19, 13, 144, 3, 12, 638, 116, 10, 27, 18, 9, 3271, 1385, 39, 49, 9, 534, 2, 33, 66, 9, 3, 18, 636, 397, 109, 464, 549, 10, 531, 9, 534, 2, 239, 9, 3271, 1385, 1, 3457, 7, 54, 208, 711, 1202, 2, 1301, 632, 3803, 792, 42, 1259, 2902, 12, 534, 530, 772, 481, 2, 3271, 1385, 530, 660, 664, 19, 13, 1421, 119, 1, 3, 18, 636, 4, 150, 101, 638, 1, 1259, 2902, 34, 20, 833, 212, 1, 660, 140, 252, 3271, 1385, 279, 492, 3, 528, 1, 8, 411, 688, 47, 616, 3230, 9409, 4244, 272, 1857, 327, 1, 3, 57, 688, 47, 85, 5149, 21, 2060, 17, 3, 119, 1, 534, 4, 3357, 5, 3271, 1385, 2519, 191, 12, 638, 3329, 411, 257, 40, 515, 492, 361, 3, 534, 301, 16, 378, 76, 39, 21929, 805, 15, 3271, 1385, 16, 3230, 9, 12, 871, 4, 3, 1127, 1, 1668, 9409, 4244, 272]",1803.0,7512659,141
Accuracy of digital rectal examination and transrectal ultrasonography in localizing prostate cancer.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,1994-11-01,"Not all prostate cancers are sonographically hypoechoic or palpable on digital rectal examination, and suspicious areas on transrectal prostatic ultrasonography or digital rectal examination often are not cancer. We present quadrant biopsy results from a multicenter prostate cancer screening study in which men were evaluated with prostate specific antigen (PSA) and digital rectal examination. If the PSA level was elevated (greater than 4.0 ng./ml., Hybritech Tandem assay) or digital rectal examination was suspicious quadrant biopsies were performed. Biopsy specimens were labeled separately, and histological findings were correlated by quadrant with the findings on ultrasonography and digital rectal examination. Of the 6,630 subjects enrolled into the study 16% were biopsied. Of 1,002 quadrants that were suspicious on digital rectal examination 110 (11%) had cancer, while 308 of 418 quadrants containing cancer (74%) were not suspicious on digital rectal examination. Of 855 quadrants that were sonographically suspicious 153 (18%) had cancer, while 282 of 435 quadrants containing cancer (65%) were not sonographically suspicious. Of 225 patients with cancer 137 (61%) would have been missed if only the exact site of the palpable induration had been biopsied. Of 251 patients with cancer 131 (52%) would have been missed if only the exact site of the hypoechoic lesion had been biopsied.

Selection of optimal prostate specific antigen cutoffs for early detection of prostate cancer: receiver operating characteristic curves.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,1994-12-01,"A prospective clinical trial of prostate cancer screening was conducted at 6 university centers including 6,630 men 50 years old or older who underwent a serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) determination and digital rectal examination. Biopsies were performed if the PSA level was greater than 4.0 ng./ml. (Hybritech Tandem assay) or digital rectal examination was suspicious for cancer. We evaluated the effect on biopsy rate and cancer detection if the cutoff value was shifted from 4.0 to age-specific reference ranges recommended in the literature. In men 50 to 59 years old with normal digital rectal examination findings a decrease from 4.0 to 3.5 ng./ml. would have resulted in a 45% increase in the number of biopsies (39 of 87) and a projected 15% increase in cancer detection. An increase from 4.0 to 4.5 ng./ml. in men 60 to 69 years old would result in 15% fewer biopsies (35 of 238) and would miss 8% of the organ confined tumors (2 of 25). Increasing the cutoff to 6.5 ng./ml. in men 70 years old or older would result in 44% fewer biopsies (70 of 159) and would miss 47% of the organ confined cancers (7 of 15). The number of biopsies performed for each cancer detected with a PSA level of greater than 4.0 ng./ml. remains constant across age groupings, which suggests that the cutoff of 4.0 ng./ml. does not need to be altered in the older men, since it is apparently unaffected by the simultaneously increasing prevalence of benign prostatic hyperplasia and cancer with age.

Effect of patient age on early detection of prostate cancer with serum prostate-specific antigen and digital rectal examination.,Urology,Urology,1993-10-01,"This study was designed to determine the effects of age by decade on the efficacy of digital rectal examination (DRE) and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for early detection of prostate cancer in men aged fifty and over. A prospective multicenter clinical trial was conducted at six university centers. All 6,630 male volunteers underwent a serum PSA (Hybritech, Tandem) determination and DRE. Quadrant biopsies of the prostate were performed if PSA was > 4 ng/mL or DRE suspicious. A total of 1,167 biopsies were performed, and 264 cancers were detected. The cancer detection rate increased from 3 percent in men aged fifty to fifty-nine to 14 percent in men eighty years or older (p < 0.0001). PSA detected significantly more of the total cancers than DRE at all age ranges (p < 0.05). The positive predictive values (PPV) for PSA were 32 percent (50-59 years), 30 percent (60-69 years), 34 percent (70-79 years), and 38 percent (80+ years). The corresponding PPVs for DRE were 17 percent, 21 percent, 25 percent, and 38 percent. Eighteen percent of the cancers were detected solely by DRE, whereas 45 percent of cancers were detected solely by PSA. Thus, the use of both tests in combination provided the highest rate of detection in all age groups. One hundred-sixty patients underwent radical prostatectomy and pathologic staging.

During the past 50 years, the techniques, indications, and pathologic interpretation of prostate biopsies have evolved. The abandonment of blind finger-guided needle biopsies in favor of systematic TRUS-guided biopsies epitomizes much of this change. Similarly, the indications for prostate biopsy have become more refined. In the past, the presence of a prostatic nodule on digital rectal examination (DRE) was the primary indication for biopsy until the introduction of prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) in the 1980s and its widespread use for prostate cancer screening. Abnormalities of PSA or its derivatives now represent the most common indication for prostate biopsy. Although TRUS initially began as a tool to direct needles into various locations within the prostate, today a great deal of information can be obtained from prostate ultrasound for the discerning clinician. As such, TRUS-guided biopsy of the prostate has become an important staging and diagnostic tool for the practicing urologist.

Methadone use in cancer patients with pain: a review.,Journal of palliative medicine,J Palliat Med,2002-02-01,"In recent years a better understanding of the pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties of methadone, including equianalgesic ratios has led to its increased use as a second line opioid for the treatment of pain in patients with cancer. Methadone may be an important alternative for those who have side effects related to the use of other opioids because it has no known active metabolites, is well absorbed by oral and rectal routes, and also has the advantage of very low cost. However, it has a long, unpredictable half-life, which can result in accumulation and toxicity in some patients. In addition, rotation to methadone as a second line agent is more complex than with other opioids because of its increased potency in those patients who are opioid tolerant, particularly those who have been on higher doses of other opioids. Future research should address the use of methadone as a first-line agent in the management of cancer pain, its use in patients with neuropathic pain, and in those who develop rapid tolerance to other opioids.

Assessing the predictive value of clinical complete response to neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer: an analysis of 488 patients.,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,J. Am. Coll. Surg.,2002-02-01,"Patients with transmural or node-positive rectal cancer benefit from the addition of chemoradiation to surgical resection. Administration of the chemoradiation (combined modality therapy) preoperatively has gained popularity in recent years. Some patients undergo apparent complete tumor regression after preoperative combined modality therapy, and controversy exists about the proper management of these patients. Some investigators have proposed that such patients should simply be observed and not undergo resection. The purpose of this study was to determine the significance of clinical complete response to preoperative combined modality therapy. Specifically, we have attempted to determine the frequency with which a clinical complete response (based on the absence of detectable tumor on preoperative digital rectal examination and proctoscopy) correlates with a pathologic complete response (based on the absence of cancer cells in the resected specimen). A retrospective review of the clinical and pathologic characteristics of 488 patients from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering prospective colorectal database who received preoperative chemoradiation followed by resection for primary rectal cancer was performed. The indications for preoperative therapy included clinical or ultrasound T3 or T4 tumors or node-positive disease. The clinical complete response rate to preoperative therapy was 19%. All patients underwent resection subsequent to preoperative therapy regardless of response. The pathologic complete response rate among all patients was 10%. The pathologic complete response rate among clinical complete responders was 25%. Clinical complete response was a significant predictive factor for pathologic complete response, but the majority (75%) of clinical complete responders had persistent foci of tumor that were not detectable on preoperative examination or proctoscopy. Clinical complete response to preoperative therapy as determined by preoperative digital rectal examination and proctoscopy or EUA is not an accurate predictor of pathologic complete response. A significant percentage of clinical complete responders have persistent deep tumors or nodal involvement. We do not recommend making treatment decisions based solely on the absence of clinically palpable or visible tumor after chemoradiation.

Transrectal gene therapy of the prostate in the canine model.,Cancer gene therapy,Cancer Gene Ther.,2002-02-01,"Direct transrectal delivery of therapeutic genes utilizing adenoviral vectors for advanced prostate cancer may offer effective treatment at the molecular level. Large animal models to assess feasibility and the intraprostatic and systemic dissemination patterns of these vectors have not been reported. For these studies, a replication-deficient (E1(-)/E3(-)) recombinant adenovirus (AdRSVlacZ) expressing bacterial beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) was delivered under transrectal ultrasound guidance. Two prostate biopsies, followed by concurrent injection of 4.8 x 10(9) pfu of the adenoviral vector divided into either 1 or 2 mL of diluent, were performed (n=4). Swabs of the rectum, sputum, and urine were collected and after 72 hours, the animals were sacrificed. Specimens were assayed for the presence of virus and beta-gal activity. Rectal swabs were transiently positive, whereas urine and sputum samples showed no detectable vector throughout the experiment. Beta-gal activity was observed at the prostate injection sites with detectable activity noted up to 7.5 mm away from the injection site. Systemic dissemination was observed regardless of the injected volume. In conclusion, transrectal prostate biopsy with concurrent prostate injection is a feasible method to deliver therapeutic adenoviral vectors for the treatment of prostate cancer; however, systemic distribution and temporary rectal shedding of virus should be anticipated.",Journal Article,6563.0,5.0,Direct transrectal delivery of therapeutic genes utilizing adenoviral vectors for advanced cancer may offer effective treatment at the molecular level Large animal models to assess feasibility and the intraprostatic and systemic dissemination patterns of these vectors have not been reported For these studies a replication-deficient E1 /E3 recombinant adenovirus AdRSVlacZ expressing bacterial beta-galactosidase beta-gal was delivered under transrectal ultrasound guidance Two biopsies followed by concurrent injection of 4.8 x 10 9 pfu of the adenoviral vector divided into either 1 or 2 mL of diluent were performed n=4 Swabs of the rectum sputum and urine were collected and after 72 hours the animals were sacrificed Specimens were assayed for the presence of virus and beta-gal activity swabs were transiently positive whereas urine and sputum samples showed no detectable vector throughout the experiment Beta-gal activity was observed at the injection sites with detectable activity noted up to 7.5 mm away from the injection site Systemic dissemination was observed regardless of the injected volume In conclusion transrectal biopsy with concurrent injection is a feasible method to deliver therapeutic adenoviral vectors for the treatment of cancer however systemic distribution and temporary shedding of virus should be anticipated,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[1196, 9409, 989, 1, 189, 214, 2600, 4771, 5453, 9, 131, 12, 68, 1918, 323, 24, 28, 3, 219, 301, 375, 2026, 274, 6, 423, 1437, 2, 3, 15469, 2, 403, 3430, 764, 1, 46, 5453, 47, 44, 85, 210, 9, 46, 94, 8, 2079, 1971, 6778, 7193, 2835, 4488, 52753, 1046, 5117, 1090, 14735, 1090, 9427, 10, 1623, 669, 9409, 1945, 2753, 100, 1154, 370, 20, 750, 1754, 1, 39, 66, 1006, 79, 83, 18154, 1, 3, 4771, 3374, 2176, 237, 361, 14, 15, 18, 542, 1, 37094, 11, 173, 78, 39, 19424, 1, 3, 3660, 11546, 2, 2646, 11, 786, 2, 50, 720, 1459, 3, 2258, 11, 15470, 623, 11, 4499, 9, 3, 463, 1, 1450, 2, 1090, 9427, 128, 19424, 11, 9235, 109, 547, 2646, 2, 11546, 347, 224, 77, 2083, 3374, 2432, 3, 8722, 1090, 9427, 128, 10, 164, 28, 3, 1754, 633, 5, 2083, 128, 1051, 126, 6, 67, 33, 321, 6565, 29, 3, 1754, 606, 403, 3430, 10, 164, 1583, 1, 3, 2651, 433, 4, 1221, 9409, 411, 5, 750, 1754, 16, 8, 1313, 596, 6, 3392, 189, 4771, 5453, 9, 3, 24, 1, 12, 137, 403, 1395, 2, 7579, 11394, 1, 1450, 257, 40, 4078]",1343.0,11857037,610

Aspirin inhibits cyclooxygenase enzymes and blocks prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis. Using rectal PGE(2) levels as a mucosal biomarker, we sought to determine the optimal aspirin dose that would significantly suppress PGE(2) levels for chemoprevention trials. We conducted a randomized, double-blinded study in 60 subjects with prior sporadic colorectal adenoma(s) and evaluated three aspirin doses (81, 325, and 650 mg) or placebo taken daily for 4 weeks. PGE(2) levels in rectal biopsies performed at baseline and week 4 were analyzed by competitive immunoassay. Plasma salicylate levels, pill counts, and subject calendars were used to assess compliance. The 81-mg aspirin dose significantly suppressed PGE(2) levels relative to placebo (P = 0.005) and did so to an equivalent extent as did higher doses (P > 0.4) in evaluable subjects (n = 55) over a 4-week treatment period. Serum salicylate levels were associated with aspirin dose (P = 0.0002). Pill counts and calendars indicated that >98% of doses were taken by all subjects.

Role of systematic ultrasound-guided staging biopsies in predicting extraprostatic extension and seminal vesicle invasion in men with prostate cancer.,Journal of clinical ultrasound : JCU,J Clin Ultrasound,,"To assess the presence of extraprostatic extension and seminal vesicle invasion in men with prostate cancer, we performed systematic staging biopsies targeting neurovascular bundles, seminal vesicles, and other extraprostatic tissues before the men underwent radical prostatectomy. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical efficacy of these systematic staging biopsies compared with digital rectal examination (DRE) and transrectal sonography (TRUS). Two hundred forty-four candidates for prostatectomy who had a diagnostic biopsy Gleason score of 8 or higher and/or indications of extraprostatic extension (eg, seminal vesicle invasion) by DRE or TRUS underwent staging biopsies using an 18-gauge Tru-Cut needle under real-time TRUS guidance between June 1997 and March 2000. We determined the number of staging biopsy cores to be taken based on the Gleason score of the diagnostic biopsy as well as abnormal DRE and/or TRUS findings. The chi-square test was used to evaluate the statistical significance of differences. There were no complications of staging biopsy. In 75 (31%) of the 244 patients, results of the staging biopsies were positive. The clinical stage was upgraded by staging biopsy in 18 (24%) of these 75 patients. After the staging biopsies, 90 patients underwent radical prostatectomy. Among these 90 patients, staging biopsy specimens were positive for cancer in 20 (47%) of the 43 patients who received neoadjuvant therapy and in 1 (2%) of the 47 patients who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy. There were no false-positive staging biopsies in either group. Among the 90 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, the false-negative rate for the prediction of organ-confined disease was 43% (30/69) for staging biopsies compared with 29% (10/34) for TRUS. The diagnostic accuracy of staging biopsies (67%; 60/90) was higher than that of DRE (52%; 47/90; p < 0.05) but lower than that of TRUS (79%; 71/90; p = 0.066). Staging biopsies can reliably sample extraprostatic tissue, including the seminal vesicles and neurovascular bundles. Positive staging biopsy results can aid in the selection of treatment options and in the prediction of outcome for individual patients by providing definitive histologic confirmation of locally advanced disease. Conventional predictive variables for staging can be applied when the results of staging biopsies are negative.",Journal Article,,13.0,To assess the presence of extraprostatic extension and seminal vesicle invasion in men with cancer we performed systematic staging biopsies targeting neurovascular bundles seminal vesicles and other extraprostatic tissues before the men underwent radical prostatectomy We retrospectively evaluated the clinical efficacy of these systematic staging biopsies compared with digital examination DRE and transrectal sonography TRUS Two hundred forty-four candidates for prostatectomy who had a diagnostic biopsy Gleason score of 8 or higher and/or indications of extraprostatic extension eg seminal vesicle invasion by DRE or TRUS underwent staging biopsies using an 18-gauge Tru-Cut needle under real-time TRUS guidance between June 1997 and March 2000 We determined the number of staging biopsy cores to be taken based on the Gleason score of the diagnostic biopsy as well as abnormal DRE and/or TRUS findings The chi-square test was used to evaluate the statistical significance of differences There were no complications of staging biopsy In 75 31 of the 244 patients results of the staging biopsies were positive The clinical stage was upgraded by staging biopsy in 18 24 of these 75 patients After the staging biopsies 90 patients underwent radical prostatectomy Among these 90 patients staging biopsy specimens were positive for cancer in 20 47 of the 43 patients who received neoadjuvant therapy and in 1 2 of the 47 patients who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy There were no false-positive staging biopsies in either group Among the 90 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy the false-negative rate for the prediction of organ-confined disease was 43 30/69 for staging biopsies compared with 29 10/34 for TRUS The diagnostic accuracy of staging biopsies 67 60/90 was higher than that of DRE 52 47/90 p 0.05 but lower than that of TRUS 79 71/90 p 0.066 Staging biopsies can reliably sample extraprostatic tissue including the seminal vesicles and neurovascular bundles Positive staging biopsy results can aid in the selection of treatment options and in the prediction of outcome for individual patients by providing definitive histologic confirmation of locally advanced disease Conventional predictive variables for staging can be applied when the results of staging biopsies are negative,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[6, 423, 3, 463, 1, 8236, 2401, 2, 4786, 5608, 578, 4, 325, 5, 12, 21, 173, 1556, 632, 1154, 529, 9848, 16206, 4786, 7634, 2, 127, 8236, 742, 348, 3, 325, 208, 711, 1202, 21, 894, 194, 3, 38, 209, 1, 46, 1556, 632, 1154, 72, 5, 3271, 1385, 8627, 2, 9409, 8367, 7682, 100, 1128, 1213, 294, 1931, 9, 1202, 54, 42, 8, 752, 411, 1406, 368, 1, 66, 15, 142, 2, 15, 2406, 1, 8236, 2401, 2887, 4786, 5608, 578, 20, 8627, 15, 7682, 208, 632, 1154, 75, 35, 203, 10145, 23092, 3554, 2177, 669, 1589, 98, 7682, 2753, 59, 1924, 2341, 2, 2363, 1081, 21, 509, 3, 207, 1, 632, 411, 4357, 6, 40, 1633, 90, 23, 3, 1406, 368, 1, 3, 752, 411, 22, 149, 22, 1668, 8627, 2, 15, 7682, 272, 3, 3163, 3219, 412, 10, 95, 6, 376, 3, 1050, 724, 1, 362, 125, 11, 77, 521, 1, 632, 411, 4, 481, 456, 1, 3, 6567, 7, 99, 1, 3, 632, 1154, 11, 109, 3, 38, 82, 10, 9162, 20, 632, 411, 4, 203, 259, 1, 46, 481, 7, 50, 3, 632, 1154, 424, 7, 208, 711, 1202, 107, 46, 424, 7, 632, 411, 623, 11, 109, 9, 12, 4, 179, 662, 1, 3, 601, 7, 54, 103, 536, 36, 2, 4, 14, 18, 1, 3, 662, 7, 54, 205, 44, 560, 536, 36, 125, 11, 77, 2133, 109, 632, 1154, 4, 361, 87, 107, 3, 424, 7, 54, 208, 711, 1202, 3, 2133, 199, 116, 9, 3, 1590, 1, 1259, 2902, 34, 10, 601, 201, 790, 9, 632, 1154, 72, 5, 462, 79, 562, 9, 7682, 3, 752, 1190, 1, 632, 1154, 598, 335, 424, 10, 142, 76, 17, 1, 8627, 653, 662, 424, 19, 13, 474, 84, 280, 76, 17, 1, 7682, 842, 792, 424, 19, 13, 11241, 632, 1154, 122, 4092, 1000, 8236, 246, 141, 3, 4786, 7634, 2, 9848, 16206, 109, 632, 411, 99, 122, 2427, 4, 3, 881, 1, 24, 838, 2, 4, 3, 1590, 1, 228, 9, 797, 7, 20, 1736, 1057, 884, 3551, 1, 795, 131, 34, 809, 464, 682, 9, 632, 122, 40, 1498, 198, 3, 99, 1, 632, 1154, 32, 199]",2303.0,11948567,38
Gastrointestinal manifestations of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2002-05-01,"To determine the clinical features, natural history, and role of surgery for gastrointestinal manifestations of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) syndromes. The MEN 2 syndromes are characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma and other endocrinopathies. In addition, some patients with MEN 2A develop Hirschsprung's disease (HD), and all patients with MEN 2B have intestinal neuromas and megacolon that can cause significant gastrointestinal problems. From 83 families with MEN 2A, eight patients with HD were identified (MEN 2A-HD). These and all patients with MEN 2B followed at the authors' institution (n = 53) were sent questionnaires to describe the onset and type of gastrointestinal symptoms and treatment they had before the diagnosis of MEN 2. Records of all patients responding were reviewed, including radiographic imaging, histology, surgical records, and genetic testing. Thirty-six of the 61 patients (59%) responded (MEN 2A = 8, MEN 2B = 28) to the questionnaires. All patients with MEN 2A-HD were operated on for HD 2 to 63 years before being diagnosed with MEN 2. All patients responding were underweight as infants and had symptoms of abdominal pain, distention, and constipation. Eighty-eight percent had hematochezia, 63% had emesis, and 33% had intermittent diarrhea before surgery. All patients with MEN 2A-HD had rectal biopsies with a diverting colostomy as the initial surgical procedure. This was followed by a colostomy takedown and pull-through procedure at a later interval. Ninety-three percent of patients with MEN 2B had gastrointestinal symptoms 1 to 24 years before the diagnosis of MEN 2. Symptoms included flatulence (86%), abdominal distention or being underweight as a child (64%), abdominal pain (54%), constipation or diarrhea (43%), difficulty swallowing (39%), and vomiting (14%).

Predictors of survival in recurrent rectal cancer after resection and intraoperative radiotherapy.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2002-05-01,"This study was designed to determine predictors of survival after surgery and intraoperative radiotherapy for recurrent rectal cancer. From a prospective database, 634 patients undergoing resection for recurrent rectal cancer between January 1990 and June 2000 were identified. Of these, 111 received intraoperative radiotherapy with curative intent, and 100 were available for follow-up. Clinicopathologic variables from both the primary and recurrent operations were evaluated as predictors of disease-free and disease-specific survival by multivariate Cox regression and log-rank test. There were 54 males and 46 females, with a median age of 57 (range, 37-83) years. With a median follow-up of 23.2 months, 60 patients (60 percent) recurred: 20 (33 percent) locally, 27 (45 percent) distantly, and 13 (22 percent) at both sites. Of all variables analyzed, only complete resection with microscopically negative margins and the absence of vascular invasion in the recurrent specimen predicted improved disease-free and disease-specific survival (P < 0.01 for all). Median disease-free survival and median disease-specific survival were 31.2 and 66.1 months, respectively, for complete resection compared with 7.9 and 22.8 months for resection with microscopic or grossly positive margins (P < 0.01 for both). Median disease-free survival and median disease-specific survival were 6.4 and 16.1 months, respectively, in the presence of vascular invasion in the recurrent specimen compared with 23.3 and 57.3 months in the absence of vascular invasion (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). Complete resection and the absence of vascular invasion were the only predictors of improved local control as well (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively).

Long-term prognostic significance of extent of rectal cancer response to preoperative radiation and chemotherapy.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2002-07-01,"To determine whether selected clinicopathologic factors, including the extent of pathologic response to preoperative radiation and chemotherapy (RT +/- chemo), have an impact on long-term recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with locally advanced primary rectal cancer after optimal multimodality therapy. Although complete pathologic response to preoperative RT +/- chemo has been detected in up to 30% of rectal cancers, its significance on long-term outcome has not been widely reported. Previous retrospective studies evaluating clinical outcome in patients with complete or near-complete pathologic response documented good prognosis in this population but were limited by median follow-up in the range of 2 to 3 years. Sixty-nine patients with locally advanced (T(3-4) and/or N1) primary rectal cancer were prospectively identified. All were treated at one institution with preoperative RT to the pelvis (at least 4,500 cGy). Forty patients received concurrent preoperative 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy and 27 received both pre- and postoperative chemotherapy. Patients underwent resection 4 to 7 weeks after completion of RT. TNM stage, angiolymphatic or perineural invasion, and extent of response to preoperative RT +/- chemo were determined by pathologic evaluation. Adverse pathologic features were defined as the presence of angiolymphatic and/or perineural invasion. RFS at 5 years was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method. With a median follow-up of 69 months, 5-year RFS was 79%. RFS was significantly worse for patients with aggressive pathologic features and positive nodal status identified in the postirradiated surgical specimen. Risk ratios for RFS were 3.68 for the presence of aggressive pathologic features and 4.64 for node-positive rectal cancers. In patients with greater than 95% rectal cancer response to preoperative RT +/- chemo, only one patient has died as a consequence of cancer, another has died of an unrelated cause, and the remainder were free of disease with a minimum follow-up of 47 months. These data suggest that a marked response to preoperative RT +/- chemo may be associated with good long-term outcome but was not predictive of RFS. The presence of poor histopathologic features and positive nodal status are the most important prognostic indicators after neoadjuvant therapy.",Journal Article,6413.0,232.0,"To determine whether selected clinicopathologic factors including the extent of pathologic response to preoperative radiation and chemotherapy RT +/- chemo have an impact on long-term recurrence-free survival RFS in patients with locally advanced primary cancer after optimal multimodality therapy Although complete pathologic response to preoperative RT +/- chemo has been detected in up to 30 of cancers its significance on long-term outcome has not been widely reported Previous retrospective studies evaluating clinical outcome in patients with complete or near-complete pathologic response documented good prognosis in this population but were limited by median follow-up in the range of 2 to 3 years Sixty-nine patients with locally advanced T 3-4 and/or N1 primary cancer were prospectively identified All were treated at one institution with preoperative RT to the pelvis at least 4,500 cGy Forty patients received concurrent preoperative 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy and 27 received both pre- and postoperative chemotherapy Patients underwent resection 4 to 7 weeks after completion of RT TNM stage angiolymphatic or perineural invasion and extent of response to preoperative RT +/- chemo were determined by pathologic evaluation Adverse pathologic features were defined as the presence of angiolymphatic and/or perineural invasion RFS at 5 years was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method With a median follow-up of 69 months 5-year RFS was 79 RFS was significantly worse for patients with aggressive pathologic features and positive nodal status identified in the postirradiated surgical specimen Risk ratios for RFS were 3.68 for the presence of aggressive pathologic features and 4.64 for node-positive cancers In patients with greater than 95 cancer response to preoperative RT +/- chemo only one patient has died as a consequence of cancer another has died of an unrelated cause and the remainder were free of disease with a minimum follow-up of 47 months These data suggest that a marked response to preoperative RT +/- chemo may be associated with good long-term outcome but was not predictive of RFS The presence of poor histopathologic features and positive nodal status are the most important prognostic indicators after neoadjuvant therapy",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[6, 223, 317, 715, 1399, 130, 141, 3, 1039, 1, 510, 51, 6, 498, 121, 2, 56, 240, 3341, 47, 35, 345, 23, 319, 337, 146, 115, 25, 1272, 4, 7, 5, 795, 131, 86, 12, 50, 665, 2425, 36, 242, 236, 510, 51, 6, 498, 240, 3341, 71, 85, 530, 4, 126, 6, 201, 1, 163, 211, 724, 23, 319, 337, 228, 71, 44, 85, 1792, 210, 698, 459, 94, 1435, 38, 228, 4, 7, 5, 236, 15, 1829, 236, 510, 51, 1405, 1178, 356, 4, 26, 266, 84, 11, 383, 20, 52, 166, 126, 4, 3, 184, 1, 18, 6, 27, 60, 1746, 762, 7, 5, 795, 131, 102, 27, 39, 2, 15, 3192, 86, 12, 11, 1143, 108, 62, 11, 73, 28, 104, 731, 5, 498, 240, 6, 3, 3270, 28, 506, 39, 1666, 3071, 1213, 7, 103, 750, 498, 33, 1404, 90, 56, 2, 428, 103, 110, 671, 2, 573, 56, 7, 208, 170, 39, 6, 67, 244, 50, 1438, 1, 240, 2918, 82, 13005, 15, 4917, 578, 2, 1039, 1, 51, 6, 498, 240, 3341, 11, 509, 20, 510, 451, 290, 510, 404, 11, 395, 22, 3, 463, 1, 13005, 2, 15, 4917, 578, 1272, 28, 33, 60, 10, 509, 20, 3, 876, 882, 596, 5, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 790, 53, 33, 111, 1272, 10, 842, 1272, 10, 97, 639, 9, 7, 5, 571, 510, 404, 2, 109, 779, 156, 108, 4, 3, 37236, 221, 2360, 43, 1137, 9, 1272, 11, 27, 806, 9, 3, 463, 1, 571, 510, 404, 2, 39, 660, 9, 289, 109, 163, 4, 7, 5, 378, 76, 48, 12, 51, 6, 498, 240, 3341, 158, 104, 69, 71, 1016, 22, 8, 4177, 1, 12, 1809, 71, 1016, 1, 35, 2092, 708, 2, 3, 7095, 11, 115, 1, 34, 5, 8, 2499, 166, 126, 1, 662, 53, 46, 74, 309, 17, 8, 2003, 51, 6, 498, 240, 3341, 68, 40, 41, 5, 1178, 319, 337, 228, 84, 10, 44, 464, 1, 1272, 3, 463, 1, 334, 2630, 404, 2, 109, 779, 156, 32, 3, 96, 305, 177, 3539, 50, 536, 36]",2264.0,12131088,353
Increased endocrine cells in treated rectal adenocarcinomas: a possible reflection of endocrine differentiation in tumor cells induced by chemotherapy and radiotherapy.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2002-07-01,"The presence of focal endocrine cells in colorectal adenocarcinoma is a relatively common phenomenon. However, endocrine differentiation in treated adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract has received little attention. We noted striking numbers of cells with endocrine morphology and phenotype in the residual tumor of six randomly encountered cases of rectal adenocarcinoma that were subjected to neoadjuvant therapy. All six cases had a substantial treatment response (> or =50%). To validate our initial observation and to explore its clinicopathologic significance, further morphologic and immunohistochemical studies were performed on 53 cases of rectal adenocarcinomas treated with preoperative radiation with (33 cases) or without (20 cases) chemotherapy. Pretreatment biopsies from 20 of the 53 cases and 79 resection specimens of rectal adenocarcinoma that received no neoadjuvant therapy were used as controls. Chromogranin positivity was identified in the posttreatment resection specimens in 36 of the 53 study cases (67.9%). Twenty of the 36 showed positive staining in > or =20% of the residual tumor cells. The chromogranin-positive cells in these cases often formed cords or nests. On hematoxylin and eosin sections these cells had markedly eosinophilic cytoplasm and round and uniform or sometimes pleomorphic nuclei with an often dense chromatin pattern. The proportion of chromogranin-positive cells was significantly associated with the extent of treatment response (p = 0.0005). Tumors treated with both chemotherapy and radiotherapy were more likely to have abundant chromogranin-positive cells compared with tumors treated with radiotherapy alone (p = 0.0004). In contrast, only 30% of the pretreatment biopsies and 17.7% of the control resection specimens of untreated rectal carcinomas showed chromogranin-positive cells, predominantly arranged as scattered individual positive cells, constituting <10% of the tumor. No significant correlation was observed between pretreatment and posttreatment specimens with regard to chromogranin positivity (p = 1.0). Ten of 15 patients (66.7%) whose resection specimens showed positive chromogranin staining failed to demonstrate any chromogranin positivity in their pretreatment biopsy specimens. In addition, groups or nests of chromogranin-positive cells noted in posttreatment specimens showed a very low Ki67 labeling index (<5%) but showed a frequency of abnormal p53 protein expression comparable with that observed in tumor foci resembling conventional adenocarcinoma (66.7% vs 62.5%). Our findings demonstrate that there is an increased frequency and density of cells with an endocrine phenotype in rectal adenocarcinomas that were subjected to neoadjuvant therapy and that the extent of endocrine cells appears proportional to the degree of treatment response. The possible mechanism for the increased endocrine cells in treated rectal adenocarcinomas may be related to induction of endocrine differentiation in tumor cells by cytotoxic insult.",Journal

associated with the extent of treatment response p 0.0005 Tumors treated with both chemotherapy and radiotherapy were more likely to have abundant chromogranin-positive cells compared with tumors treated with radiotherapy alone p 0.0004 In contrast only 30 of the pretreatment biopsies and 17.7 of the control resection specimens of untreated carcinomas showed chromogranin-positive cells predominantly arranged as scattered individual positive cells constituting 10 of the tumor No significant correlation was observed between pretreatment and posttreatment specimens with regard to chromogranin positivity p 1.0 Ten of 15 patients 66.7 whose resection specimens showed positive chromogranin staining failed to demonstrate any chromogranin positivity in their pretreatment biopsy specimens In addition groups or nests of chromogranin-positive cells noted in posttreatment specimens showed a very low Ki67 labeling index 5 but showed a frequency of abnormal p53 protein expression comparable with that observed in tumor foci resembling conventional adenocarcinoma 66.7 vs 62.5 Our findings demonstrate that there is an increased frequency and density of cells with an endocrine phenotype in adenocarcinomas that were subjected to neoadjuvant therapy and that the extent of endocrine cells appears proportional to the degree of treatment response The possible mechanism for the increased endocrine cells in treated adenocarcinomas may be related to induction of endocrine differentiation in tumor cells by cytotoxic

High prevalence of screening-detected prostate cancer among Afro-Caribbeans: the Tobago Prostate Cancer Survey.,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev.,2002-08-01,"Risk for prostate cancer is high among African Americans. We hypothesized that risk for prostate cancer is also high in other populations of African descent. Our objective was to determine the screening-detected prevalence of prostate cancer in the predominantly Afro-Caribbean population on the island of Tobago. Male residents, ages 40-79 years, were invited to participate in a population-based screening for prostate cancer using serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and digital rectal exam (DRE). Men with elevated PSA (>or=4 ng/ml) or abnormal DRE were offered an ultrasound-guided sextant biopsy of the prostate gland. Men (2484), ages 40-79 years, underwent prostate cancer screening between September 1997 and June 2001. Mean age was 55.9, SD was 10.6 years, and median was 54 years. Mean serum PSA was 14.8 ng/ml, SD was 376 [excluding 4 values >or= 2 SD above the mean (1,112, 1,317, 1,818, and 18,330 ng/ml) mean PSA was 5.5 ng/ml and SD was 29.6], and median PSA was 1.2 ng/ml. Elevated PSA and/or abnormal DRE were observed in 31% (759 of 2484) overall, and in age groups 40-49 (87 of 843, 10%), 50-59 (201 of 729, 28%), 60-69 (262 of 584, 45%), and 70-79 (209 of 328, 64%). Of 681 men biopsied, 259 (38%, or 10% of the 2484 screened) were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Age-specific rates of screening detected prostate cancer were: 1%, ages 40-79 years; 7%, ages 50-59 years; 18%, ages 60-69 years; and 28%, ages 70-79 years. These screening results indicate a very high screening-detected prevalence of prostate cancer in this population of West African descent. These data support the hypothesis that populations of African descent share genetic and/or lifestyle factors that contribute to their elevated risk for prostate cancer.",Journal Article,6382.0,116.0,"Risk for cancer is high among African Americans We hypothesized that risk for cancer is also high in other populations of African descent Our objective was to determine the screening-detected prevalence of cancer in the predominantly Afro-Caribbean population on the island of Tobago Male residents ages 40-79 years were invited to participate in a population-based screening for cancer using serum prostate-specific antigen PSA and digital exam DRE Men with elevated PSA or=4 ng/ml or abnormal DRE were offered an ultrasound-guided sextant biopsy of the gland Men 2484 ages 40-79 years underwent cancer screening between September 1997 and June 2001 Mean age was 55.9 SD was 10.6 years and median was 54 years Mean serum PSA was 14.8 ng/ml SD was 376 excluding 4 values or= 2 SD above the mean 1,112 1,317 1,818 and 18,330 ng/ml mean PSA was 5.5 ng/ml and SD was 29.6 and median PSA was 1.2 ng/ml Elevated PSA and/or abnormal DRE were observed in 31 759 of 2484 overall and in age groups 40-49 87 of 843 10 50-59 201 of 729 28 60-69 262 of 584 45 and 70-79 209 of 328 64 Of 681 men biopsied 259 38 or 10 of the 2484 screened were diagnosed with cancer Age-specific rates of screening detected cancer were 1 ages 40-79 years 7 ages 50-59 years 18 ages 60-69 years and 28 ages 70-79 years These screening results indicate a very high screening-detected prevalence of cancer in this population of West African descent These data support the hypothesis that populations of African descent share genetic and/or lifestyle factors that contribute to their elevated risk for cancer",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[43, 9, 12, 16, 64, 107, 1410, 2731, 21, 1237, 17, 43, 9, 12, 16, 120, 64, 4, 127, 1184, 1, 1410, 9171, 114, 461, 10, 6, 223, 3, 453, 530, 1078, 1, 12, 4, 3, 2117, 53052, 15140, 266, 23, 3, 3454, 1, 53053, 1045, 5662, 2165, 327, 842, 60, 11, 7594, 6, 3506, 4, 8, 266, 90, 453, 9, 12, 75, 524, 1364, 112, 448, 534, 2, 3271, 6747, 8627, 325, 5, 804, 534, 15, 39, 997, 542, 15, 1668, 8627, 11, 2216, 35, 1945, 1808, 11256, 411, 1, 3, 2326, 325, 37244, 2165, 327, 842, 60, 208, 12, 453, 59, 2636, 2341, 2, 1924, 1758, 313, 89, 10, 614, 83, 1270, 10, 79, 49, 60, 2, 52, 10, 667, 60, 313, 524, 534, 10, 213, 66, 997, 542, 1270, 10, 9534, 3207, 39, 1030, 15, 18, 1270, 2090, 3, 313, 14, 3726, 14, 7869, 14, 13520, 2, 203, 7105, 997, 542, 313, 534, 10, 33, 33, 997, 542, 2, 1270, 10, 462, 49, 2, 52, 534, 10, 14, 18, 997, 542, 804, 534, 2, 15, 1668, 8627, 11, 164, 4, 456, 13812, 1, 37244, 63, 2, 4, 89, 271, 327, 739, 912, 1, 11766, 79, 212, 728, 4766, 1, 17660, 339, 335, 790, 7801, 1, 9640, 512, 2, 431, 842, 5941, 1, 8584, 660, 1, 14442, 325, 6775, 7696, 519, 15, 79, 1, 3, 37244, 2261, 11, 265, 5, 12, 89, 112, 151, 1, 453, 530, 12, 11, 14, 2165, 327, 842, 60, 67, 2165, 212, 728, 60, 203, 2165, 335, 790, 60, 2, 339, 2165, 431, 842, 60, 46, 453, 99, 1008, 8, 923, 64, 453, 530, 1078, 1, 12, 4, 26, 266, 1, 7261, 1410, 9171, 46, 74, 538, 3, 1492, 17, 1184, 1, 1410, 9171, 4349, 336, 2, 15, 3487, 130, 17, 1248, 6, 136, 804, 43, 9, 12]",1574.0,12163325,534
[The 1992 TNM classification of T2 prostate cancer predicts pathologic stage and prognosis better than the revised 1997 classification].,Nihon Hinyokika Gakkai zasshi. The japanese journal of urology,Nippon Hinyokika Gakkai Zasshi,2002-07-01,"In the 1997 the TNM staging system for prostate cancer was changed, reclassifying, T2 cancers from 3 groups (T2a, less than one half of one lobe; T2b, one lobe; and T2c, both lobes) to 2 groups (T2a, one lobe; and T2b, both lobes), combining the 1992 T2a and T2b into the 1997 T2a subclassification. We investigated the pathological stage and prognosis of cancers in the 1992 and 1997 subclassification to determine whether this change was warranted. We studied a consecutive series of 555 patients with clinical stage T2 prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) between 1983 and 1998. We analyzed the clinical, pathological features and PSA non-progression rate after prostatectomy for patients classified according to the 1992 and the 1997 TNM system. Median follow-up was 51.3 months. In the 1992 TNM system T2a tumors were more likely to have a low PSA (5.8 versus 7.2 and 8.1 ng/ml, p = 0.034, p = 0.012), be confined to the prostate (67% versus 45% and 40%, p < 0.001 for both), be poorly differentiated (48% versus 63% and 66%, p = 0.002 for both) and have a low cancer volume (1.22 versus 2.27 and 2.63 cm3, p = 0.005 for both) than T2b and T2c tumors. But there were no significant differences between T2b and T2c. Reflecting these results, the patients with T2a cancer had a significantly better prognosis with 82 +/- 4% PSA non-progression rate at 5 years compared to 68 +/- 4% of patients with T2b and 73 +/- 4% of patients with T2c (p = 0.007, p = 0.048, respectively). In the 1997 TNM system T2a tumors were also different from T2b tumors in terms with the frequency of confined cancer (54% versus 40%, p = 0.006) and cancer volume (1.78 versus 2.63 cm3, p = 0.013). However, the those differences were smaller than those in 1992 system. There were no significant differences between 1997 T2a and T2b cancers in the serum PSA level and the frequency of a poorly differentiated cancer. In fact, the 5-years recurrence-free survival rate for patients with T2a (73 +/- 3%) was identical to that for T2b cancer. In a Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, however, neither the 1992 nor the 1997 TNM staging subclassifications of T2 cancers were independent predictor of PSA non-progression when the age of patient, serum PSA level and biopsy Gleason grade were included in the analysis. Since a palpable tumor less than half of one lobe (1992 T2a) has a distinctly different pathological and prognostic significance compared to T2b and T2c cancers, the T2a subclassification should be retained in future revisions of TNM staging system. However, because the digital rectal examination provides limited information, both PSA results and histological grade in a biopsy specimen should be incorporated into future revision of the TNM staging system.",Comparative Study,6413.0,,In the 1997 the TNM staging system for cancer was changed reclassifying T2 cancers from 3 groups T2a less than one half of one lobe T2b one lobe and T2c both

Correlation of smoking history and other patient characteristics with major complications of pelvic radiation therapy for cervical cancer.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2002-09-01,"The purpose of this study was to identify patient-related factors that influence the risk of serious late complications of pelvic radiation therapy. The records of 3,489 patients treated with radiation therapy for International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage I or II carcinoma of the cervix were reviewed for information about patient characteristics, treatment details, and outcomes. Any complication occurring or persisting more than 3 months after treatment that required hospitalization, transfusion, or an operation or caused severe symptoms or the patient's death was considered a major late complication. Complication rates were calculated actuarially. The median duration of follow-up was 85 months, and 99% of patients were followed for at least 3 years or until they died. Heavy smoking was the strongest independent predictor of overall complications (multivariate hazard ratio, 2.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.84 to 2.87). The most striking influence of smoking was on the incidence of small bowel complications (hazard ratio for smokers of one or more packs per day, 3.25; 95% CI, 2.21 to 4.78). Hispanics had a significantly lower rate of small bowel complications than whites, and blacks had higher rates of bladder and rectal complications than whites. Thin women had an increased risk of gastrointestinal complications, and obese women were more likely to have serious bladder complications.

Impact of T and N substage on survival and disease relapse in adjuvant rectal cancer: a pooled analysis.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2002-10-01,"To determine the rates of survival and disease control by TNM and MAC stage in three randomized North American rectal adjuvant studies. Data were merged from 2551 eligible patients on NCCTG 79-47-51 (n = 200), NCCTG 86-47-51 (n = 656), and INT 114 (n = 1695). All patients received postoperative radiation, and 96% were randomized to receive concomitant and maintenance chemotherapy. Five-year follow-up was available in 94% of patients and 7-yr follow-up in 84%. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate the distribution of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), and p values were derived using the log-rank test. Time to local and distant relapse was estimated using cumulative incidence methodology. Analyses were adjusted for treatment effect using Cox proportional hazards models. OS and DFS were dependent on both TN stage and NT stage (N substage within T stage and T substage within N stage). Even among N2 patients (4 or more LN+), T stage influenced 5-yr OS (T1-2, 69%; T3, 48%; T4, 38%). Three risk groups of patients were defined: (1) intermediate: T3N0, T1-2N1; (2) moderately high: T4N0, T1-2N2, T3N1; and (3) high: T3N2, T4N1, T4N2. For Group 1, 5-yr OS was 74% and 81%, and 5-yr DFS was 66% and 74%. For Group 2, 5-yr OS ranged from 61% to 69%, and for Group 3, OS ranged from 33% to 48%. Cumulative incidence rates of local relapse and distant metastases revealed similar differences by TN and NT stage, as seen in the survival analyses. Patients with a single high-risk factor of either extension beyond the rectal wall (T3N0) or nodal involvement (T1-2N1) have improved OS, DFS, and disease control when compared to those with both high risk factors. Different treatment strategies may be indicated for intermediate- (T3N0, T1-2N1) vs. moderately high or high-risk patients in view of differential survival and rates of relapse.

Long-term results of local excision for rectal cancer.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2002-10-01,"To review the authors' experience with local excision of early rectal cancers to assess the effectiveness of initial treatment and of salvage surgery. Local excision for rectal cancer is appealing for its low morbidity and excellent functional results. However, its use is limited by inability to assess regional lymph nodes and uncertainty of oncologic outcome. Patients with T1 and T2 adenocarcinomas of the rectum treated by local excision as definitive surgery between 1969 to 1996 at the authors' institution were reviewed. Pathology slides were reviewed. Among 125 assessable patients, 74 were T1 and 51 were T2. Thirty-one patients (25%) were selected to receive adjuvant radiation therapy. Fifteen of these 31 patients received adjuvant radiation in combination with 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy. Median follow-up was 6.7 years. One hundred fifteen patients (92%) were followed until death or for greater than 5 years, and 69 patients (55%) were followed until death or for greater than 10 years. Recurrence was recorded as local, distant, and overall. Survival was disease-specific. Ten-year local recurrence and survival rates were 17% and 74% for T1 rectal cancers and 26% and 72% for T2 cancers. Median time to relapse was 1.4 years (range 0.4-7.0) for local recurrence and 2.5 years (0.8-7.5) for distant recurrence. In patients receiving radiotherapy, local recurrence was delayed (median 2.1 years vs. 1.1 years), but overall rates of local and overall recurrence and survival rates were similar to patients not receiving radiotherapy. Among 26 cancer deaths, 8 (28%) occurred more than 5 years after local excision. On multivariate analysis, no clinical or pathologic features were predictive of local recurrence. Intratumoral vascular invasion was the only significant predictor of survival. Among 34 patients who developed tumor recurrence, the pattern of first clinical recurrence was predominantly local: 50% local only, 18% local and distant, and 32% distant only. Among the 17 patients with isolated local recurrence, 14 underwent salvage resection. Actuarial survival among these surgically salvaged patients was 30% at 6 years after salvage. CONCLUSIONS The long-term risk of recurrence after local excision of T1 and T2 rectal cancers is substantial. Two thirds of patients with tumor recurrence have local failure, implicating inadequate resection in treatment failure.

Hospital and surgeon procedure volume as predictors of outcome following rectal cancer resection.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2002-11-01,"To compare surgeon and hospital procedure volume as predictors of outcomes for patients with rectal cancer. Although a ""volume-outcome"" relationship exists for several major cancer operations, the impact of procedure volume on outcomes following rectal cancer surgery remains uncertain, and it has not been determined whether hospital or surgeon volume is a more important predictor of outcomes. A retrospective population-based cohort study utilizing the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database identified 2,815 rectal cancer patients aged 65 and older who had surgery for a primary tumor diagnosed in 1992-1996 in a SEER area. Hospital- and surgeon-specific procedure volume was ascertained based on the number of claims submitted over the 5-year study period. Outcome measures were mortality at 30 days and 2 years, overall survival, and the rate of abdominoperineal resections. Age, sex, race, comorbid illness, cancer stage, and socioeconomic status were used to adjust for differences in case mix. Neither hospital- nor surgeon-specific procedure volume was significantly associated with 30-day postoperative mortality or rates of rectal sphincter-sparing operations. Although an association between hospital volume and mortality at 2 years was evident, this finding was no longer significant once surgeon-specific volume was controlled for. In contrast, surgeon-specific volume was associated with 2-year mortality and remained an important predictor even after adjustment for hospital volume. Surgeon volume was also better than hospital procedure volume at predicting long-term survival.

Predictors of cancer in repeat extended multisite prostate biopsy in men with previous negative extended multisite biopsy.,Urology,Urology,2002-11-01,"To evaluate the factors influencing the cancer detection rate in men whose initial and repeat biopsies were both performed using an extended multisite biopsy scheme. Sextant biopsy of the prostate is associated with a significant false-negative rate, as evident from the high cancer detection rate after repeat prostate biopsy. Extended multisite biopsy schemes have therefore been recommended to maximize cancer detection. Between June 1997 and August 2001, 939 men underwent prostate biopsy for early detection of prostate cancer using the extended multisite scheme (10 or 11 cores incorporating the anterior horn of the peripheral zone with or without midline peripheral zone and/or the transition zone). Of these 939 men, 89 (9.5%) underwent a repeat extended multisite prostate biopsy. The median prostate-specific antigen level was 6.9 ng/mL (range 0.7-36.1). Twenty-four men (27%) had an abnormal digital rectal examination at presentation. Most men (86%) in the group undergoing repeat biopsy had two or more risk factors for a positive biopsy. The median interval between biopsies was 4 months. Of the 89 men, 15 (17%) had prostate cancer in the repeat biopsy specimen. Seven cancers (47%) were found only in the alternate biopsy sites, 5 (33%) cancers were found only in the sextant sites, and 3 in both sextant and alternate sites. Cancer was present in only one biopsy core in 11 (73%) of the 15 men, and the median Gleason score was 6 (range 6-8). On multivariate analysis, the presence of atypical glands suspicious for carcinoma (AGSC) was the only independent predictor of cancer in repeat biopsy (P <0.004). Of the 79 men without AGSC in the initial biopsy, 8 (10%) had a positive repeat biopsy. The total and percent free prostate-specific antigen level, digital rectal examination, ultrasound findings, and presence of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia were not predictive of cancer detection. The probability of a positive result for a repeat prostate biopsy is lower after an initial extended multisite biopsy compared with an initial sextant biopsy. The presence of AGSC was the only significant predictor of cancer in the repeat biopsy. Because nearly 50% of cancers detected in the repeat biopsy were in alternate sites only, using a sextant biopsy scheme for repeat biopsy would have missed these cancers.",Journal Article,6290.0,105.0,To evaluate the factors influencing the cancer detection rate in men whose initial and repeat biopsies were both performed using an extended multisite biopsy scheme Sextant biopsy of the is associated with a significant false-negative rate as evident from the high cancer detection rate after repeat biopsy Extended multisite biopsy schemes have therefore been recommended to maximize cancer detection Between June 1997 and August 2001 939 men underwent biopsy for early detection of cancer using the extended multisite scheme 10 or 11 cores incorporating the anterior horn of the peripheral zone with or without midline peripheral zone and/or the transition zone Of these 939 men 89 9.5 underwent a repeat extended multisite biopsy The median prostate-specific antigen level was 6.9 ng/mL range 0.7-36.1 Twenty-four men 27 had an abnormal digital examination at presentation Most men 86 in the group undergoing repeat biopsy had two or more risk factors for a positive biopsy The median interval between biopsies was 4 months Of the 89 men 15 17 had cancer in the repeat biopsy specimen Seven cancers 47 were found only in the alternate biopsy sites 5 33 cancers were found only in the sextant sites and 3 in both sextant and alternate sites Cancer was present in only one biopsy core in 11 73 of the 15 men and the median Gleason score was 6 range 6-8 On multivariate analysis the presence of atypical glands suspicious for carcinoma AGSC was the only independent predictor of cancer in repeat biopsy P 0.004 Of the 79 men without AGSC in the initial biopsy 8 10 had a positive repeat biopsy The total and percent free prostate-specific antigen level digital examination ultrasound findings and presence of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia were not predictive of cancer detection The probability of a positive result for a repeat biopsy is lower after an initial extended multisite biopsy compared with an initial sextant biopsy The presence of AGSC was the only significant predictor of cancer in the repeat biopsy Because nearly 50 of cancers detected in the repeat biopsy were in alternate sites only using a sextant biopsy scheme for repeat biopsy would have missed these cancers,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[6, 376, 3, 130, 4743, 3, 12, 638, 116, 4, 325, 1310, 388, 2, 2334, 1154, 11, 110, 173, 75, 35, 1747, 9030, 411, 4633, 11256, 411, 1, 3, 16, 41, 5, 8, 93, 2133, 199, 116, 22, 2853, 29, 3, 64, 12, 638, 116, 50, 2334, 411, 1747, 9030, 411, 7103, 47, 673, 85, 793, 6, 4116, 12, 638, 59, 1924, 2341, 2, 2480, 1758, 14457, 325, 208, 411, 9, 191, 638, 1, 12, 75, 3, 1747, 9030, 4633, 79, 15, 175, 4357, 2570, 3, 2882, 26080, 1, 3, 672, 3614, 5, 15, 187, 8677, 672, 3614, 2, 15, 3, 1970, 3614, 1, 46, 14457, 325, 887, 83, 33, 208, 8, 2334, 1747, 9030, 411, 3, 52, 1364, 112, 448, 301, 10, 49, 83, 997, 542, 184, 13, 67, 511, 14, 737, 294, 325, 428, 42, 35, 1668, 3271, 1385, 28, 1031, 96, 325, 868, 4, 3, 87, 479, 2334, 411, 42, 100, 15, 80, 43, 130, 9, 8, 109, 411, 3, 52, 268, 59, 1154, 10, 39, 53, 1, 3, 887, 325, 167, 269, 42, 12, 4, 3, 2334, 411, 2360, 648, 163, 662, 11, 204, 158, 4, 3, 4689, 411, 633, 33, 466, 163, 11, 204, 158, 4, 3, 11256, 633, 2, 27, 4, 110, 11256, 2, 4689, 633, 12, 10, 364, 4, 158, 104, 411, 1793, 4, 175, 803, 1, 3, 167, 325, 2, 3, 52, 1406, 368, 10, 49, 184, 49, 66, 23, 331, 65, 3, 463, 1, 1973, 3966, 3230, 9, 134, 37307, 10, 3, 158, 306, 980, 1, 12, 4, 2334, 411, 19, 13, 1520, 1, 3, 842, 325, 187, 37307, 4, 3, 388, 411, 66, 79, 42, 8, 109, 2334, 411, 3, 181, 2, 714, 115, 1364, 112, 448, 301, 3271, 1385, 1945, 272, 2, 463, 1, 64, 88, 3329, 4153, 2298, 11, 44, 464, 1, 12, 638, 3, 1320, 1, 8, 109, 757, 9, 8, 2334, 411, 16, 280, 50, 35, 388, 1747, 9030, 411, 72, 5, 35, 388, 11256, 411, 3, 463, 1, 37307, 10, 3, 158, 93, 980, 1, 12, 4, 3, 2334, 411, 408, 1857, 212, 1, 163, 530, 4, 3, 2334, 411, 11, 4, 4689, 633, 158, 75, 8, 11256, 411, 4633, 9, 2334, 411, 688, 47, 5149, 46, 163]",2199.0,12429311,626
Sphincter-sparing local excision and adjuvant radiation for anal-rectal melanoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2002-12-01,"To evaluate the outcome and toxicity of a sphincter-sparing treatment strategy in the management of patients with anal-rectal melanoma. Between 1989 and 2000, 23 patients with invasive anal-rectal melanoma were managed with sphincter-sparing surgical resection and adjuvant radiation. Surgery consisted of primary local excision, as well as dissection for patients with documented regional nodal disease. Adjuvant radiation was delivered using a hypofractionated regimen of 30 Gy in five fractions over 2.5 weeks. Adjuvant systemic therapy was delivered to nine patients: cytotoxic chemotherapy in seven and immunotherapy in two. After a median follow-up of 32 months, 15 patients had relapsed and 15 patients had died. The actuarial 5-year overall, disease-specific, disease-free, and distant metastasis-free survival rates were 31%, 36%, 37%, and 35%, respectively. The actuarial 5-year local and regional nodal control rates were 74% and 84%, respectively. No patient had locoregional failure as the sole site of failure and no patient required salvage abdominoperineal resection (APR). By univariate analysis, patients with nodal disease at presentation had a decreased actuarial 5-year disease-specific (0% v 45%, P =.004), disease-free (0% v 45%, P <.001), and distant metastasis-free survival (0% v 42%, P <.001).

Topoisomerase I protein expression in primary colorectal cancer and lymph node metastases.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2002-11-01,"Topoisomerase I (topo I) is an important target for the treatment of malignant disease, especially colorectal cancer. Because there is little information on the expression of topo I in colorectal tumors, this study evaluated and characterized topo I protein expression in primary colorectal cancer and lymph node metastases and studied the association between topo I protein expression and clinicopathologic data, p53 status, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) status. Immunohistochemistry assay was performed for topo I protein expression in 249 primary human colorectal cancer and 42 paired lymph node metastasis samples. Topo I expression was described as the percentage of cells staining positive for topo I, along with the intensity and localization of the staining. Clinicopathologic data (sex, age, Dukes' stage, differentiation grade, survival status), p53 status, and PCNA status were statistically analyzed for association with topo I protein expression. Topo I expression in paired primary lymph node metastases were studied for concordance. Topo I protein expression was detected in 127 (51%) samples, including 24.4% with >50% positive tumor cells. The majority had nuclear (70.1%) or nuclear and cytoplasmic staining (17.3%). A higher percentage of cells expressing topo I in primary colorectal cancer was significantly associated with advanced age (P =.040). Patients with rectal cancer had greater topo I expression than those with colon tumors (P =.029). No significant correlation was found between topo I protein expression and sex, Dukes' stage, differentiation grade, survival status, p53 status, and PCNA status. Concordance in topo I staining between primary and lymph node metastases was observed in 33 of 42 cases (P =.029). This suggests that the activity of topo I inhibitors will not differ across various tumor stages, pathology, and patient gender. p53 and PCNA status do not appear to influence topo I expression, and topo I has no apparent association with the acquisition of a metastatic phenotype.

Eighty stage IV patients with resectable primary rectal tumors treated with radical rectal surgery without radiotherapy were identified. Sixty-one (76%) patients received chemotherapy; response information was available for 34 patients. Radical resection was accomplished by low anterior resection (n = 65), abdominoperineal resection (n = 11), and Hartmann's resection (n = 4). Surgical complications were seen in 12 patients (15%), with 1 death and 4 reoperations. The local recurrence rate was 6% (n = 5), with a median time to local recurrence of 14 months. Only one patient received pelvic radiotherapy as salvage treatment. One patient required subsequent diverting colostomy. Median survival was 25 months. On multivariate analysis, the extent of metastasis and response to chemotherapy were determinants of prolonged survival.

Local therapy for rectal cancer.,The Surgical clinics of North America,Surg. Clin. North Am.,2002-10-01,"Local procedures for carefully selected distal rectal cancer offer significant advantages such as sphincter preservation and avoidance of radical surgery. However, since preoperative selection criteria including current imaging modalities are unable to definitively stage regional lymph node status, local therapies for rectal cancer have the inherent potential disadvantage of undertreating a fraction of patients due to unresected mesorectal/regional lymph node disease. Current available data suggests that the local approach may be appropriate only for carefully selected T1 tumors with favorable pathologic features. Inferior local control and survival reported for T2 tumors and T1 tumors with unfavorable features, despite the addition of chemoradiation, outweigh the advantages of the local approach. Patients with unfavorable tumors who are unable to tolerate radical resection or who refuse surgery may be treated with local excision with or without adjuvant chemoradiation. Other modalities, such as electrocoagulation and endocavitary radiation, may also be valuable in this setting, as well as preoperative chemoradiation followed by local excision.

Adjuvant therapy of cancers of the colon and rectum.,The Surgical clinics of North America,Surg. Clin. North Am.,2002-10-01,"Important advances have been made in our understanding of the role of adjuvant therapy for colorectal cancer. Current standard 5FU-based regimens have been convincingly shown to reduce the incidence of recurrences and to prolong overall survival in patients with resected stage III colon cancer. Colon cancer patients with stage II disease have a better-overall prognosis than those with stage III; however, the relative merits of adjuvant treatment in these patients remains controversial. Combined chemotherapy plus radiation therapy is currently the standard adjuvant approach for stage II and III rectal cancer patients.

Adequacy of 1-cm distal margin after restorative rectal cancer resection with sharp mesorectal excision and preoperative combined-modality therapy.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,,"Preoperative combined-modality therapy (CMT) for rectal cancer allows a sphincter-sparing procedure in some individuals who would otherwise require an abdominoperineal resection. To further define the subset of rectal cancer patients suitable for this approach, we determined the adequacy of a distal margin of < or = 1 cm in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer requiring preoperative CMT. Ninety-four consecutive patients, status post curative low anterior resection for rectal cancer after preoperative CMT, were identified from the prospective Colorectal Service Database. Distal margin length, tumor grade, tumor-node-metastasis stage, presence of lymphovascular and perineural invasion, and tumor distance from the anal verge were examined for their effect on recurrence and survival. Median follow-up was 44 months. Distal margin length ranged from.1 to 9.5 cm (median, 2.0 cm) and did not correlate with local recurrence (hazard ratio, 1.1; P =.34) or recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.1; P =.29) by univariate analysis.

Response to preoperative chemoradiation increases the use of sphincter-preserving surgery in patients with locally advanced low rectal carcinoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2003-01-01,"Although controversial, some believe that preoperative chemoradiation increases the use of sphincter-preserving surgery in low rectal carcinoma patients. This article investigates the relationship between objective tumor response and sphincter preservation in low rectal carcinoma patients. The authors reviewed the records of 238 patients with T3 or T4 low rectal carcinoma (< or = 6 cm from the anal verge) who underwent preoperative pelvic chemoradiation (45 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks, n = 182 or 52.5 Gy/30 fractions/5 weeks, n = 56 with continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil at 300 mg/m(2), Monday to Friday) followed by mesorectal (n = 223) or local excision (n = 15). A logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the influence of objective tumor response (defined as complete clinical response) and other prognostic factors on sphincter preservation. Because degrees of partial response could not be objectively defined retrospectively, the influence of partial response on sphincter preservation could not be evaluated. Overall, 49% of patients (117 of 238) had sphincter-preserving surgery. The clinical complete response rate was 47%. Independent predictors of sphincter preservation included the year of surgery, tumor distance from the anal verge, circumferential tumor involvement, and response to chemoradiation. The sphincter preservation rate increased over the period of the study (from 28% [December 1989 to December 1992] to 44% [January 1993 to December 1996] to 67% [January 1997 to December 2000]). The difference in the rates of sphincter preservation according to response was most striking among patients with tumors 3 cm or less from the anal verge (44% vs. 22%, P = 0.01). The pelvic disease recurrence rate among patients undergoing sphincter-preserving surgery has been less than 10% since January 1993 and was not statistically different between the groups treated from January 1993 to December 1996 and from January 1997 to December 2000. There has been an increase in the use of sphincter-preserving surgery without an increase in pelvic disease recurrence over the past decade.

Use of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy for colorectal cancer in a population-based cohort.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2003-04-01,"Randomized trials have demonstrated that adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival for patients with stage III colon cancer and that chemotherapy combined with radiation therapy improves survival for patients with stage II or III rectal cancer. This population-based study was designed to assess use of these treatments in clinical practice. From the California Cancer Registry, we identified all patients diagnosed during 1996 to 1997 with stage III colon cancer (n = 1,422) and stage II or III rectal cancer (n = 534) in 22 northern California counties. To supplement registry data on adjuvant therapies and ascertain reasons they were not used, we surveyed physicians or reviewed office records for 1,449 patients (74%). Chemotherapy rates varied widely by age from 88% (age < 55 years) to 11% (age >or= 85 years), and radiation therapy varied similarly. Adjusting for demographic, clinical, and hospital characteristics, chemotherapy was used less often among older and unmarried patients, and radiation therapy was used less often among older patients, black patients, and those initially treated in low-volume hospitals. Adjusted rates of chemotherapy varied significantly (P <.01) among individual hospitals: 79% and 51%, respectively, at one SD above and below average (67%).

National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for the management of prostate cancer.,Urology,Urology,2003-02-01,"Guidelines for the management of prostate cancer issued by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network provide a basis for rational treatment decisions. These guidelines represent consensus recommendations by a panel of experts that are evidence based and are designated according to the degree of consensus within the expert panel. The initial stratification point is the patient's life expectancy (>5 or <5 years). If life expectancy is >5 years, the recommended intervention is based on clinical stage, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and Gleason score, as well as the presence of symptoms. These assessments establish the patient's risk of recurrence after therapy. Specific initial therapies are then recommended according to whether the risk category is low, intermediate, high, or very high. The guidelines also describe the appropriate use of observation (""watchful waiting"") versus active intervention in certain patients. After definitive therapy, patients should be monitored with PSA determinations, digital rectal examination, and bone scans, as outlined in the guidelines. Patients who exhibit increasing PSA levels after prostatectomy are candidates for salvage therapy with androgen ablation, radiotherapy, or observation. If PSA levels begin to increase after radiotherapy, surgery may then be an additional option. Systemic salvage therapy generally consists of androgen ablation; the benefit of total androgen blockade versus initial monotherapy remains controversial. Relapse after initial androgen ablation is treated with an antiandrogen, if none had been administered previously. Patients refractory to further hormonal manipulations are observed or receive palliative therapy, including chemotherapy. The treatment of prostate cancer is complex.

Curative potential of multimodality therapy for locally recurrent rectal cancer.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2003-04-01,"To assess the results of multimodality therapy for patients with recurrent rectal cancer and to analyze factors predictive of curative resection and prognostic for overall survival. Locally recurrent rectal cancer is a difficult clinical problem, and radical treatment options with curative intent are not generally accepted. A total of 394 patients underwent surgical exploration for recurrent rectal cancer. Ninety were found to have unresectable local or extrapelvic disease and 304 underwent resection of the recurrence. The latter patients were prospectively followed to determine long-term survival and factors influencing survival. Overall 5-year survival was 25%. Curative, negative resection margins were obtained in 45% of patients; in these patients a 5-year survival of 37% was achieved, compared to 16% (P <.001) in patients with either microscopic or gross residual disease. In a logistic regression analysis, initial surgery with end-colostomy and symptomatic pain (both univariate) and increasing number of sites of the recurrent tumor fixation in the pelvis (multivariate) were associated with palliative surgery. Overall survival was significantly decreased for symptomatic pain (P <.001) and more than one fixation (P =.029). Survival following extended resection of adjacent organs was not different from limited resection (28% vs. 21%, P =.11). Patient demographics and factors related to the initial rectal cancer did not affect outcome. Perioperative mortality was only 0.3%, but significant morbidity occurred in 26% of patients, with pelvic abscess being the most common complication. This study demonstrates that many patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer can be resected with negative margins.

Relation of hospital volume to colostomy rates and survival for patients with rectal cancer.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2003-05-01,"Postoperative mortality after some types of cancer surgery is inversely related to the number of operations performed at a hospital (i.e., hospital volume). This study assessed the association of hospital volume with colostomy rates and survival for patients with rectal cancer in a large representative cohort identified from the California Cancer Registry. We identified 7257 patients diagnosed from January 1, 1994, through December 31, 1997, with stage I-III rectal cancer who underwent surgical resection. Registry data were linked to hospital discharge abstracts and ZIP-code-level data from the 1990 U.S. Census. Associations of hospital volume with permanent colostomy and 30-day mortality were assessed with the Mantel-Haenszel trend test and logistic regression. Overall survival was examined with the Kaplan-Meier method and a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. Multivariable analyses adjusted for demographic and clinical variables and patient clustering within hospitals. All tests of statistical significance were two-sided. In unadjusted analyses across decreasing quartiles of hospital volume, we observed statistically significant increases in colostomy rates (29.5%, 31.8%, 35.2%, and 36.6%; P<.001) and in 30-day postoperative mortality (1.6%, 1.6%, 2.9%, and 4.8%; P<.001) and a decrease in 2-year survival (83.7%, 83.2%, 80.9%, and 76.6%; P<.001). The adjusted risks of permanent colostomy (odds ratio [OR] = 1.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10 to 1.70), 30-day mortality (OR = 2.64, 95% CI = 1.41 to 4.93), and 2-year mortality (hazard ratio = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.15 to 1.44) were greater for patients at hospitals in the lowest volume quartile than for patients at hospitals in the highest volume quartile. Stratification by tumor stage and comorbidity index did not appreciably affect the results.

Prognostic significance of depth of gross or microscopic perirectal fat invasion in T3 N0 M0 rectal cancers following sharp mesorectal excision and no adjuvant therapy.,International journal of colorectal disease,Int J Colorectal Dis,2003-06-03,"Although the standard of care for T3 and/or N1-2 rectal cancers includes adjuvant chemoradiation, it is unclear whether T3 N0 patients with limited microscopic perirectal fat invasion warrant further therapy. Our aim was to determine the prognostic significance of gross perirectal fat invasion, or depth of microscopic perirectal fat invasion, in T3 N0 rectal cancers following sharp mesorectal excision and no adjuvant therapy. Utilizing a prospective database, the medical records of 108 patients who underwent a potentially curative resection for T3 N0 rectal cancer between June 1986 and December 1994 were analyzed. All pathological specimens were re-reviewed by a single pathologist, and extent of perirectal fat invasion was measured in millimeters. Patients who received either preoperative or postoperative adjuvant therapy were excluded. Macroscopic perirectal fat invasion (T3 gross) was present in 49 cases, absent in 40 cases (T3 microscopic), and not reported in 19 cases. Rectal cancers were stratified by extent of measured perirectal fat invasion into 3 mm or less and more than 3 mm. Five-year overall and local recurrence rates for the entire group were 19% and 8%, respectively. The disease-free survival, disease-specific survival, and overall recurrence for rectal cancers with 3 mm or less invasion vs. more than 3 mm invasion, or T3 gross vs. T3 microscopic, were not statistically different.

Records of surgically resected rectal cancer patients who underwent FDG-PET imaging at least 6 months after external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) were reviewed. Cases (n = 19) were defined as scans from patients in whom a pelvic recurrence was confirmed (histologically, n = 14, radiologic followup, n = 5). Controls (n = 41), defined as scans from patients without clinical or radiologic evidence of pelvic recurrence, were compared with cases for the time interval between completion of EBRT and FDG-PET imaging (RT/PET interval, mean 25.1 months versus 27.5 months, respectively), as well as EBRT dose (mean 5,084 cGy versus 5,062 cGy, respectively). All 60 FDG-PET scans were iteratively reconstructed and reinterpreted by a single nuclear medicine physician blinded to original FDG-PET interpretation and disease status. Certainty of disease was scored on a five-point scale (1 to 5), with scores greater than or equal to 4 considered positive. FDG-PET correctly identified 16 of 19 recurrences, for a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 88%. Overall accuracy was 87%. Positive predictive value was 76% and negative predictive value was 92%. Positive predictive value and accuracy improved in scans performed more than 12 months after EBRT.

All radiotherapy was given to a total dose of 4,500 to 5,400 cGy with conventional doses and techniques. Most patients received concurrent 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. There were 39 patients in the preoperative radiotherapy group, 11 patients in the postoperative radiotherapy group, and 59 patients in the no radiotherapy group. The postoperative radiotherapy group reported a significantly greater number of bowel movements per 24-hour period (P < 0.01) and significantly more episodes of clustered bowel movements (P < 0.02) than either the preoperative radiotherapy group or the no radiotherapy group. No significant difference in anal continence or satisfaction with bowel function was found among the three groups. In this study of straight (nonreservoir) coloanal anastomoses, postoperative pelvic radiotherapy had significant adverse effects on anorectal function, with higher rates of clustering and frequency of defecation than with preoperative radiotherapy. No differences in continence rates were demonstrated, perhaps because of the sample size of the compared groups. We attribute the adverse effects of postoperative radiotherapy to irradiation of the neorectum, which is spared when treatment is given preoperatively.

Effect of verification bias on screening for prostate cancer by measurement of prostate-specific antigen.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2003-07-01,"The sensitivity and specificity of a screening test are biased when disease status is not verified in all subjects and when the likelihood of confirmation depends on the test result itself. We assessed the screening characteristics of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement after correction for verification bias. Between 1995 and 2001, 6691 men underwent PSA-based screening for prostate cancer. Of these men, 705 (11 percent) subsequently underwent biopsy of the prostate. Under the assumption that the chance of undergoing a biopsy depends only on the PSA-test result and other observed clinical variables, we used a mathematical model to estimate adjusted receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves. Adjusting for verification bias significantly increased the area under the ROC curve (i.e., the overall diagnostic performance) of the PSA test, as compared with an unadjusted analysis (0.86 vs. 0.69, P<0.001, for men less than 60 years of age; 0.72 vs. 0.62, P=0.008, for men 60 years of age or older). If the threshold PSA value for undergoing biopsy were set at 4.1 ng per milliliter, 82 percent of cancers in younger men and 65 percent of cancers in older men would be missed. A digital rectal examination that is abnormal but not suspicious for cancer does not affect the overall performance characteristics of the test.

"The addition of continuous infusion 5-FU to preoperative radiation therapy increases tumor response, leading to increased sphincter preservation in locally advanced rectal cancer.","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2003-09-01,"To compare the outcome from preoperative chemoradiation (CXRT) and from radiation therapy (RT) in the treatment of rectal cancer in two large, single-institutional experiences. Between 1978 and 1995, 403 patients with localized, nonmetastatic, clinically staged T3 or T4 rectal cancer patients were treated with preoperative RT alone at two institutions. Patients at institution 1 (n = 207) were treated with pelvic CXRT exclusively, and patients at institution 2 were treated (except for 8 given CXRT) with pelvic RT alone (n = 196). In addition, a third group (n = 61) was treated with CXRT at institution 2 between 1998 and 2000 after a policy change. Both institutions delivered 45 Gy in five fractions as a standard dose, but institution 2 used 20 Gy in five fractions in selected cases (n = 26). At both institutions, concurrent chemotherapy consisted of a continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) at a dosage of 1500 mg/m(2)/week. The end points were response, sphincter preservation (SP), relapse-free survival (RFS), pelvic disease control (PC), and overall survival (OS). Median follow-up was 63 months for all living patients at institution 1 and in the primary group of institution 2. Multivariate analysis of the patients in these groups showed that the use of concurrent chemotherapy improved tumor response (T-stage downstaging, 62% vs. 42%, p = 0.001, and pathologic complete response, 23% vs. 5% p < 0.0001), but did not significantly improve LC, RFS, or OS. Follow-up for the secondary group at institution 2 was insufficient to allow the analysis of these endpoints. In the subset of patients receiving 45 Gy who had rectal tumors < or /=6 cm from the anal verge (institution 1: n = 132; institution 2 primary: n = 79; institution 2 secondary: n = 33), there was a significant improvement in SP with the use of concurrent chemotherapy (39% at institution 1 compared with 13% in the primary group at institution 2, p < 0.0001). A logistic regression analysis of clinical prognostic factors indicated that the use of concurrent chemotherapy independently influenced SP in these low tumors (p = 0.002). This finding was supported by a 36% SP rate in the secondary group at institution 2. Thus SP increased after the addition of chemotherapy at institution 2. The use of concurrent 5-FU with preoperative radiation therapy for T3 and T4 rectal cancer independently increases tumor response and may contribute to increased SP in patients with low rectal cancer.",Comparative Study,5986.0,102.0,To compare the outcome from preoperative chemoradiation CXRT and from radiation therapy RT in the treatment of cancer in two large single-institutional experiences Between 1978 and 1995 403 patients with localized nonmetastatic clinically staged T3 or T4 cancer patients were treated with preoperative RT alone at two institutions Patients at institution 1 n 207 were treated with pelvic CXRT exclusively and patients at institution 2 were treated except for 8 given CXRT with pelvic RT alone n 196 In addition a third group n 61 was treated with CXRT at institution 2 between 1998 and 2000 after a policy change Both institutions delivered 45 Gy in five fractions as a standard dose but institution 2 used 20 Gy in five fractions in selected cases n 26 At both institutions concurrent chemotherapy consisted of a continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil 5-FU at a dosage of 1500 mg/m 2 /week The end points were response sphincter preservation SP relapse-free survival RFS pelvic disease control PC and overall survival OS Median follow-up was 63 months for all living patients at institution 1 and in the primary group of institution 2 Multivariate analysis of the patients in these groups showed that the use of concurrent chemotherapy improved tumor response T-stage downstaging 62 vs. 42 p 0.001 and pathologic complete response 23 vs. 5 p 0.0001 but did not significantly improve LC RFS or OS Follow-up for the secondary group at institution 2 was insufficient to allow the analysis of these endpoints In the subset of patients receiving 45 Gy who had tumors or /=6 cm from the verge institution 1 n 132 institution 2 primary n 79 institution 2 secondary n 33 there was a significant improvement in SP with the use of concurrent chemotherapy 39 at institution 1 compared with 13 in the primary group at institution 2 p 0.0001 A logistic regression analysis of clinical prognostic factors indicated that the use of concurrent chemotherapy independently influenced SP in these low tumors p 0.002 This finding was supported by a 36 SP rate in the secondary group at institution 2 Thus SP increased after the addition of chemotherapy at institution 2 The use of concurrent 5-FU with preoperative radiation therapy for T3 and T4 cancer independently increases tumor response and may contribute to increased SP in patients with low cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[6, 932, 3, 228, 29, 498, 975, 7925, 2, 29, 121, 36, 240, 4, 3, 24, 1, 12, 4, 100, 375, 226, 1115, 4031, 59, 11799, 2, 2323, 10836, 7, 5, 909, 2683, 505, 2930, 2065, 15, 2463, 12, 7, 11, 73, 5, 498, 240, 279, 28, 100, 1764, 7, 28, 731, 14, 78, 5292, 11, 73, 5, 1110, 7925, 4437, 2, 7, 28, 731, 18, 11, 73, 2187, 9, 66, 447, 7925, 5, 1110, 240, 279, 78, 6369, 4, 352, 8, 1282, 87, 78, 713, 10, 73, 5, 7925, 28, 731, 18, 59, 1850, 2, 1081, 50, 8, 4196, 707, 110, 1764, 1623, 512, 381, 4, 365, 1550, 22, 8, 260, 61, 84, 731, 18, 95, 179, 381, 4, 365, 1550, 4, 715, 140, 78, 432, 28, 110, 1764, 750, 56, 1695, 1, 8, 1314, 904, 1, 33, 1404, 33, 1296, 28, 8, 3323, 1, 7204, 81, 188, 18, 647, 3, 396, 862, 11, 51, 5400, 2224, 4074, 429, 115, 25, 1272, 1110, 34, 182, 1341, 2, 63, 25, 118, 52, 166, 126, 10, 676, 53, 9, 62, 2798, 7, 28, 731, 14, 2, 4, 3, 86, 87, 1, 731, 18, 331, 65, 1, 3, 7, 4, 46, 271, 224, 17, 3, 119, 1, 750, 56, 231, 30, 51, 102, 82, 5336, 744, 105, 595, 19, 13, 144, 2, 510, 236, 51, 382, 105, 33, 19, 13, 488, 84, 205, 44, 97, 401, 1837, 1272, 15, 118, 166, 126, 9, 3, 568, 87, 28, 731, 18, 10, 3027, 6, 1700, 3, 65, 1, 46, 1387, 4, 3, 697, 1, 7, 357, 512, 381, 54, 42, 57, 15, 49, 494, 29, 3, 8330, 731, 14, 78, 4255, 731, 18, 86, 78, 842, 731, 18, 568, 78, 466, 125, 10, 8, 93, 767, 4, 4074, 5, 3, 119, 1, 750, 56, 587, 28, 731, 14, 72, 5, 233, 4, 3, 86, 87, 28, 731, 18, 19, 13, 488, 8, 812, 320, 65, 1, 38, 177, 130, 1103, 17, 3, 119, 1, 750, 56, 1042, 2574, 4074, 4, 46, 154, 57, 19, 13, 1111, 26, 1567, 10, 2708, 20, 8, 511, 4074, 116, 4, 3, 568, 87, 28, 731, 18, 631, 4074, 101, 50, 3, 352, 1, 56, 28, 731, 18, 3, 119, 1, 750, 33, 1296, 5, 498, 121, 36, 9, 2065, 2, 2463, 12, 1042, 1106, 30, 51, 2, 68, 1248, 6, 101, 4074, 4, 7, 5, 154, 12]",2335.0,12909219,260
A nomogram for predicting a positive repeat prostate biopsy in patients with a previous negative biopsy session.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2003-10-01,"Although prostate cancer is found in about 30% of patients at the initial biopsy session, there is a need to identify those with a negative result but who are at high risk. Although individual risk factors have been found to be associated with cancer, patient counseling requires the integration of multiple risk factors to obtain a prediction for the individual. We studied 343 patients with at least 1 initial negative biopsy who were tested from August 1999 to September 2001. At each biopsy session we recorded patient age, family history of prostate cancer, serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), PSA slope, digital rectal examination findings, months from the initial biopsy session, cumulative number of negative cores previously obtained, and history of high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical small acinar proliferation. Through Cox regression analysis we determined the association of each variable with time to a positive biopsy. A nomogram was constructed using all variables and discrimination was calculated as the concordance index. There were 661 biopsy sessions. A mean of 2.9 biopsy sessions were performed per patient and a mean of 9.15 cores were obtained per biopsy session for a mean of 25.2 per patient. Overall 20% of patients had cancer at the second biopsy session. The cumulative number of negative cores obtained, PSA slope, history of high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and history of atypical small acinar proliferation were associated with repeat biopsy findings (all p <0.05). A nomogram was constructed that had a concordance index of 0.70, which was greater than that of any single risk factor. We created a nomogram that predicts a positive biopsy after a previous negative biopsy session. It provides a wide range of probabilities for cancer and may improve clinical judgment before the decision to repeat biopsy.",Journal Article,5956.0,78.0,Although cancer is found in about 30 of patients at the initial biopsy session there is a need to identify those with a negative result but who are at high risk Although individual risk factors have been found to be associated with cancer patient counseling requires the integration of multiple risk factors to obtain a prediction for the individual We studied 343 patients with at least 1 initial negative biopsy who were tested from August 1999 to September 2001 At each biopsy session we recorded patient age family history of cancer serum specific antigen PSA PSA slope digital examination findings months from the initial biopsy session cumulative number of negative cores previously obtained and history of high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical small acinar proliferation Through Cox regression analysis we determined the association of each variable with time to a positive biopsy A nomogram was constructed using all variables and discrimination was calculated as the concordance index There were 661 biopsy sessions A mean of 2.9 biopsy sessions were performed per patient and a mean of 9.15 cores were obtained per biopsy session for a mean of 25.2 per patient Overall 20 of patients had cancer at the second biopsy session The cumulative number of negative cores obtained PSA slope history of high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and history of atypical small acinar proliferation were associated with repeat biopsy findings all p 0.05 A nomogram was constructed that had a concordance index of 0.70 which was greater than that of any single risk factor We created a nomogram that predicts a positive biopsy after a previous negative biopsy session It provides a wide range of probabilities for cancer and may improve clinical judgment before the decision to repeat biopsy,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[242, 12, 16, 204, 4, 545, 201, 1, 7, 28, 3, 388, 411, 5510, 125, 16, 8, 594, 6, 255, 135, 5, 8, 199, 757, 84, 54, 32, 28, 64, 43, 242, 797, 43, 130, 47, 85, 204, 6, 40, 41, 5, 12, 69, 2011, 1706, 3, 2676, 1, 232, 43, 130, 6, 3140, 8, 1590, 9, 3, 797, 21, 656, 8532, 7, 5, 28, 506, 14, 388, 199, 411, 54, 11, 650, 29, 2480, 2043, 6, 2636, 1758, 28, 296, 411, 5510, 21, 1872, 69, 89, 607, 532, 1, 12, 524, 112, 448, 534, 534, 7652, 3271, 1385, 272, 53, 29, 3, 388, 411, 5510, 967, 207, 1, 199, 4357, 373, 683, 2, 532, 1, 64, 88, 3329, 4153, 2298, 15, 1973, 302, 5874, 457, 298, 418, 320, 65, 21, 509, 3, 248, 1, 296, 1347, 5, 98, 6, 8, 109, 411, 8, 1981, 10, 2776, 75, 62, 682, 2, 3520, 10, 981, 22, 3, 1827, 558, 125, 11, 12745, 411, 4390, 8, 313, 1, 18, 83, 411, 4390, 11, 173, 379, 69, 2, 8, 313, 1, 83, 167, 4357, 11, 683, 379, 411, 5510, 9, 8, 313, 1, 243, 18, 379, 69, 63, 179, 1, 7, 42, 12, 28, 3, 419, 411, 5510, 3, 967, 207, 1, 199, 4357, 683, 534, 7652, 532, 1, 64, 88, 3329, 4153, 2298, 2, 532, 1, 1973, 302, 5874, 457, 11, 41, 5, 2334, 411, 272, 62, 19, 13, 474, 8, 1981, 10, 2776, 17, 42, 8, 1827, 558, 1, 13, 431, 92, 10, 378, 76, 17, 1, 500, 226, 43, 161, 21, 2466, 8, 1981, 17, 2623, 8, 109, 411, 50, 8, 698, 199, 411, 5510, 192, 777, 8, 1019, 184, 1, 3518, 9, 12, 2, 68, 401, 38, 8671, 348, 3, 948, 6, 2334, 411]",1814.0,14501721,411
"Predictive modeling for the presence of prostate carcinoma using clinical, laboratory, and ultrasound parameters in patients with prostate specific antigen levels < or = 10 ng/mL.",Cancer,Cancer,2003-10-01,"The objective of the current study was to develop a model for predicting the presence of prostate carcinoma using clinical, laboratory, and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) data. Data were collected on 1237 referred men with serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels < or = 10 ng/mL who underwent an initial prostate biopsy. Variables analyzed included age, race, family history, referral indication(s), prior vasectomy, digital rectal examination (DRE), PSA level, PSA density (PSAD), and TRUS findings. Twenty percent of the data were reserved randomly for study validation. Logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the relative risk, 95% confidence interval, and P values. Independent predictors of a positive biopsy result included elevated PSAD, abnormal DRE, hypoechoic TRUS finding, and age 75 years or older. Based on these variables, a predictive nomogram was developed. The sensitivity and specificity of the model were 92% and 24%, respectively, in the validation study for which the predictive probability > or = 10% was used to indicate the presence of prostate carcinoma. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the model was 73%, which was significantly higher compared with the prediction based on PSA alone (AUC, 62%). If it was validated externally, then application of this model to the biopsy decision could result in a 24% reduction in unnecessary biopsy procedures, with an overall reduction of 20%. Incorporation of clinical, laboratory, and TRUS data into a prebiopsy nomogram significantly improved the prediction of prostate carcinoma over the use of individual factors alone. Predictive nomograms may serve as an aid to patient counseling regarding prostate biopsy outcome and to reduce the number of unnecessary biopsy procedures.",Comparative Study,5956.0,81.0,The objective of the current study was to develop a model for predicting the presence of carcinoma using clinical laboratory and transrectal ultrasound TRUS data Data were collected on 1237 referred men with serum specific antigen PSA levels or 10 ng/mL who underwent an initial biopsy Variables analyzed included age race family history referral indication s prior vasectomy digital examination DRE PSA level PSA density PSAD and TRUS findings Twenty percent of the data were reserved randomly for study validation Logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the relative risk 95 confidence interval and P values Independent predictors of a positive biopsy result included elevated PSAD abnormal DRE hypoechoic TRUS finding and age 75 years or older Based on these variables a predictive nomogram was developed The sensitivity and specificity of the model were 92 and 24 respectively in the validation study for which the predictive probability or 10 was used to indicate the presence of carcinoma The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC for the model was 73 which was significantly higher compared with the prediction based on PSA alone AUC 62 If it was validated externally then application of this model to the biopsy decision could result in a 24 reduction in unnecessary biopsy procedures with an overall reduction of 20 Incorporation of clinical laboratory and TRUS data into a prebiopsy nomogram significantly improved the prediction of carcinoma over the use of individual factors alone Predictive nomograms may serve as an aid to patient counseling regarding biopsy outcome and to reduce the number of unnecessary biopsy procedures,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[3, 461, 1, 3, 291, 45, 10, 6, 690, 8, 202, 9, 1434, 3, 463, 1, 134, 75, 38, 1624, 2, 9409, 1945, 7682, 74, 74, 11, 786, 23, 33509, 1995, 325, 5, 524, 112, 448, 534, 148, 15, 79, 997, 542, 54, 208, 35, 388, 411, 682, 311, 159, 89, 1047, 607, 532, 2096, 3607, 695, 324, 53764, 3271, 1385, 8627, 534, 301, 534, 1263, 12153, 2, 7682, 272, 737, 714, 1, 3, 74, 11, 6468, 1108, 9, 45, 929, 812, 320, 65, 10, 173, 6, 1191, 3, 580, 43, 48, 307, 268, 2, 19, 1030, 306, 674, 1, 8, 109, 411, 757, 159, 804, 12153, 1668, 8627, 11380, 7682, 1567, 2, 89, 481, 60, 15, 434, 90, 23, 46, 682, 8, 464, 1981, 10, 276, 3, 485, 2, 1121, 1, 3, 202, 11, 937, 2, 259, 106, 4, 3, 929, 45, 9, 92, 3, 464, 1320, 15, 79, 10, 95, 6, 1008, 3, 463, 1, 134, 3, 965, 669, 3, 3185, 2584, 2037, 1496, 1376, 9, 3, 202, 10, 803, 92, 10, 97, 142, 72, 5, 3, 1590, 90, 23, 534, 279, 1376, 744, 492, 192, 10, 938, 7753, 818, 1581, 1, 26, 202, 6, 3, 411, 948, 359, 757, 4, 8, 259, 628, 4, 4224, 411, 1369, 5, 35, 63, 628, 1, 179, 2838, 1, 38, 1624, 2, 7682, 74, 237, 8, 26216, 1981, 97, 231, 3, 1590, 1, 134, 252, 3, 119, 1, 797, 130, 279, 464, 4620, 68, 1833, 22, 35, 2427, 6, 69, 2011, 666, 411, 228, 2, 6, 969, 3, 207, 1, 4224, 411, 1369]",1675.0,14508828,302
Endocavitary radiation therapy for rectal adenocarcinoma: 10-year results.,American journal of clinical oncology,Am. J. Clin. Oncol.,2003-10-01,"Local control, survival, and toxicity in patients treated with endocavitary radiation therapy for rectal cancer were evaluated. Thirty-five patients received a total of 20 to 155 Gy in 1 to 5 fractions with 50 kV x-rays through a treatment proctoscope. Twenty-nine of the 35 patients were treated with curative intent. Median follow-up was 102 months. Local control was achieved in 23 of the 29 patients treated curatively and in 3 of the 6 treated palliatively. Local control for patients treated curatively was 76% at 10 years. No local failures occurred after 21 months. For patients treated curatively, survival was 65% at 5 years and 42% at 10 years. Toxicity within 90 days after treatment was observed in 77% of the patients.

Total pelvic exenteration: effective palliation of perineal pain in patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2003-11-01,"Locally recurrent prostate cancer can be a debilitating disease. Perineal pain associated with rectal involvement by prostate cancer is difficult to palliate by conventional methods. We describe a group of patients who had intractable perineal pain due to locally recurrent prostate cancer and underwent total pelvic exenteration for palliation. We retrospectively reviewed the data for men who underwent total pelvic exenteration with urinary and colonic diversion at our institution between October 1995 and October 2002 for the relief of perineal pain from prostate cancer. Patients were selected for consideration for surgical extirpation on the basis of the presence of biopsy proven recurrent prostate cancer and evidence of rectal invasion on sonography. All patients received radiation therapy and hormonal therapy and had intractable perineal or pelvic pain resistant to narcotics. A total of 14 men underwent total pelvic exenteration for palliation during the 7-year period evaluated. There were no perioperative deaths. There were 7 postoperative events, including pulmonary embolus in 2 patients, and ileus, wound infection, cholecystitis, stomal stenosis and pelvic abscess in 1 patient each. After exenteration all patients had significant relief of pain and 11 (79%) had complete relief of pain symptoms. For these 11 patients the average symptom-free period was 14.1 months (range 3 to 36). Seven patients eventually died of disease, with the median period from exenteration to death being 24 months. Total pelvic exenteration is effective therapy for palliation of perineal pain associated with locally recurrent prostate cancer and can also effectively palliate other local symptoms such as hematuria, ureteral obstruction, voiding dysfunction and rectal incontinence. This procedure can be performed with acceptable morbidity in a highly select group of patients.",Evaluation Study,5925.0,39.0,Locally recurrent cancer can be a debilitating disease Perineal pain associated with involvement by cancer is difficult to palliate by conventional methods We describe a group of patients who had intractable perineal pain due to locally recurrent cancer and underwent total pelvic exenteration for palliation We retrospectively reviewed the data for men who underwent total pelvic exenteration with urinary and colonic diversion at our institution between October 1995 and October 2002 for the relief of perineal pain from cancer Patients were selected for consideration for surgical extirpation on the basis of the presence of biopsy proven recurrent cancer and evidence of invasion on sonography All patients received radiation therapy and hormonal therapy and had intractable perineal or pelvic pain resistant to narcotics A total of 14 men underwent total pelvic exenteration for palliation during the 7-year period evaluated There were no perioperative deaths There were 7 postoperative events including pulmonary embolus in 2 patients and ileus wound infection cholecystitis stomal stenosis and pelvic abscess in 1 patient each After exenteration all patients had significant relief of pain and 11 79 had complete relief of pain symptoms For these 11 patients the average symptom-free period was 14.1 months range 3 to 36 Seven patients eventually died of disease with the median period from exenteration to death being 24 months Total pelvic exenteration is effective therapy for palliation of perineal pain associated with locally recurrent cancer and can also effectively palliate other local symptoms such as hematuria ureteral obstruction voiding dysfunction and incontinence This procedure can be performed with acceptable morbidity in a highly select group of patients,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[795, 387, 12, 122, 40, 8, 8099, 34, 9893, 559, 41, 5, 799, 20, 12, 16, 1740, 6, 10982, 20, 809, 636, 21, 897, 8, 87, 1, 7, 54, 42, 9781, 9893, 559, 520, 6, 795, 387, 12, 2, 208, 181, 1110, 5668, 9, 3695, 21, 894, 446, 3, 74, 9, 325, 54, 208, 181, 1110, 5668, 5, 1660, 2, 3663, 6067, 28, 114, 731, 59, 2551, 2323, 2, 2551, 1544, 9, 3, 4586, 1, 9893, 559, 29, 12, 7, 11, 715, 9, 2415, 9, 221, 11945, 23, 3, 877, 1, 3, 463, 1, 411, 1930, 387, 12, 2, 241, 1, 578, 23, 8367, 62, 7, 103, 121, 36, 2, 1761, 36, 2, 42, 9781, 9893, 15, 1110, 559, 436, 6, 20328, 8, 181, 1, 213, 325, 208, 181, 1110, 5668, 9, 3695, 190, 3, 67, 111, 727, 194, 125, 11, 77, 1547, 1043, 125, 11, 67, 573, 281, 141, 1087, 12738, 4, 18, 7, 2, 9843, 2689, 930, 18305, 28126, 6935, 2, 1110, 7979, 4, 14, 69, 296, 50, 5668, 62, 7, 42, 93, 4586, 1, 559, 2, 175, 842, 42, 236, 4586, 1, 559, 507, 9, 46, 175, 7, 3, 1011, 934, 115, 727, 10, 213, 14, 53, 184, 27, 6, 511, 648, 7, 3124, 1016, 1, 34, 5, 3, 52, 727, 29, 5668, 6, 273, 486, 259, 53, 181, 1110, 5668, 16, 323, 36, 9, 3695, 1, 9893, 559, 41, 5, 795, 387, 12, 2, 122, 120, 1856, 10982, 127, 293, 507, 225, 22, 7798, 7213, 3191, 16280, 1527, 2, 6152, 26, 1299, 122, 40, 173, 5, 1595, 787, 4, 8, 561, 1717, 87, 1, 7]",1781.0,14532795,127

Rectal cancer: Preoperative versus postoperative irradiation as a component of adjuvant treatment.,Seminars in radiation oncology,Semin Radiat Oncol,2003-10-01,"The search for improved disease control and survival for resectable but high-risk rectal cancers has led to studies that combine all 3 modalities. For surgically resected, high-risk rectal cancers, postoperative chemoradiation has been shown to improve both disease control (local and distant) and survival (disease free and overall) and was recommended as standard adjuvant treatment at the 1990 National Institute of Health Colorectal Cancer Consensus Conference. Three randomized studies showed improved overall survival (OS) and local control for patients treated with postoperative irradiation and chemotherapy when compared with surgery alone or surgery plus irradiation control arms. These include 2 US trials, Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group and Mayo/North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) and a Norway trial. Although most preoperative external beam radiation trials show reductions in local relapse with the addition of preoperative EBRT to resection, only the large Swedish trial of approximately 1,100 patients showed a survival improvement when compared with a surgery alone control arm for resectable primary rectal cancers. In a recent pooled analysis of 3 postoperative adjuvant rectal cancer trials (NCCTG 794751, NCCTG 864751, and GI Intergroup 0114) survival and disease relapse were dependent on both TN and NT stage of disease (N substage within T stage and T substage within N stage). Even among N2 patients (4 or more positive nodes), T substage influenced 5-year OS (T1-2, 69%; T3, 48%; and T4, 38%; P <.001). Ongoing randomized trials are being conducted for patients with high-risk, resectable primary rectal cancers. The intent is to help define optimal combinations of postoperative chemoradiation (US GI Intergroup), to test sequencing issues of preoperative versus postoperative chemoradiation (Germany trial), and to determine if concurrent and maintenance 5-FU and leucovorin add to the benefits found with preoperative irradiation (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer).

Chemotherapeutic and biologic agents as radiosensitizers in rectal cancer.,Seminars in radiation oncology,Semin Radiat Oncol,2003-10-01,"Over the past 25 years, important advances have been made in the management of patients with resectable rectal cancer. Clinical studies have shown the efficacy of combined chemoradiation therapy in enhancing resectability and sphincter preservation rates, decreasing local recurrence, and improving survival of patients with rectal cancer. Although 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) remains the standard chemotherapeutic agent used concurrently with radiation therapy, newer chemotherapeutic agents including capecitabine, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin have also been studied as radiosensitizers in this setting.

Comparison of risk factors for colon and rectal cancer.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2004-01-01,"Predictors of colorectal cancer have been extensively studied with some evidence suggesting that risk factors vary by subsite. Using data from 2 prospective cohort studies, we examined established risk factors to determine whether they were differentially associated with colon and rectal cancer. Our study population included 87,733 women from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and 46,632 men from the Health Professionals Follow Up Study (HPFS). Exposure information was collected via biennial questionnaires (dietary variables were collected every 4 years). During the follow-up period (NHS: 1980 to May 31, 2000; HPFS: 1986 to January 31, 2000), we identified 1,139 cases of colon cancer and 339 cases of rectal cancer. We used pooled logistic regression to estimate multivariate relative risks for the 2 outcomes separately and then used polytomous logistic regression to compare these estimates. In the combined cohort, age, gender, family history of colon or rectal cancer, height, body mass index, physical activity, folate, intake of beef, pork or lamb as a main dish, intake of processed meat and alcohol were significantly associated with colon cancer risk. However, only age and sex were associated with rectal cancer. In a stepwise polytomous logistic regression procedure, family history and physical activity were associated with statistically significant different relative risks of colon and rectal cancer.

Impact of hospital procedure volume on surgical operation and long-term outcomes in high-risk curatively resected rectal cancer: findings from the Intergroup 0114 Study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2004-01-01,"Prior studies have demonstrated superior outcomes after a curative surgical resection of rectal cancer at hospitals where the volume of such surgeries is high. However, because these studies often lack detailed information on tumor and treatment characteristics as well as cancer recurrence, the true nature of this relation remains uncertain. We studied a nested cohort of 1,330 patients with stage II and stage III rectal cancer participating in a multicenter, adjuvant chemoradiotherapy trial. We analyzed differences in rates of sphincter-preserving operations, overall survival, and cancer recurrence by hospital surgical volume. We observed a significant difference in the rates of abdominoperineal resections across tertiles of hospital procedure volume (46.3% for patients resected at low-volume, 41.3% at medium-volume, and 31.8% at high-volume hospitals; P <.0001), even after adjustment for tumor distance from the anal verge. However, this higher rate of sphincter-sparing operations at high-volume centers was not accompanied by any increase in recurrence rates. Hospital surgical volume did not predict overall, disease-free, recurrence-free, or local recurrence-free survival. However, among patients who did not complete the planned adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (270 patients), those who underwent surgery at low-volume hospitals had a significant increase in cancer recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.01 to 3.72; P =.04 for the trend) and a nonsignificant trend toward increased overall mortality (P =.08) and local recurrence (P =.10). In contrast, no significant volume-outcome relation was noted among patients who did complete postoperative therapy. Using prospectively recorded data, we found that hospital surgical volume had no significant effect on rectal cancer recurrence or survival when patients completed standard adjuvant therapy.

Gastrointest. Surg.,2004-01-01,"Preoperative chemoradiation therapy (CRT) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer allows for radical surgery with sphincter preservation in many patients. To determine whether patients downsized with preoperative CRT may be potential candidates for local excision, we investigated residual disease patterns after neoadjuvant treatment. A retrospective analysis was carried out of patients with T3 or T4 rectal adenocarcinoma who were treated with neoadjuvant CRT. Clinical and pathologic data were analyzed to (1). determine the response rates to preoperative CRT in the tumor bed and regional nodal basin and (2). identify the incidence of residual disease in the mesorectum in patients downsized to <or=T2. A total of 219 patients met the inclusion criteria. Preoperatively 193 patients (88%) were staged as T3, and 99 patients (47%) had clinical N1 disease. The pathologic complete response rate was 20% (43 of 219 patients). T stage was downsized in 64% of the patients (140 of 219), and 69% (67 of 97) of the patients with clinical N1 disease were rendered node negative. Seventeen percent (21 of 122) of patients downsized to <or=T2 had residual disease in the mesentery. With a median follow-up of 40 months, 182 patients (83%) remain alive and free of disease.

Oncol.,2004-02-01,"In order to evaluate the impact of preoperative radiation and chemotherapy (combined modality therapy, or CMT) on primary rectal cancer and mesorectal lymph nodes (MLNs), middle and lower third rectal cancers were resected with total mesorectal excision (TME) and assessed for frequency of MLN retrieval and residual MLN involvement. Between 1990 and 2001, 187 consecutive patients underwent abdominoperineal resection (APR) or low anterior resection (LAR) for locally advanced (endorectal ultrasound [ERUS] stage, T3-4) mid and distal rectal cancer following preoperative CMT. Sphincter preservation was possible in 150 patients (80%). The mean number of retrieved MLNs was 10.6. Pre-CMT ERUS stage was compared with final pathologic stage. Comparison of pre-CMT ERUS stage with pathologic stage revealed a decrease in T stage in 93 patients (49%), as well as a decrease in the percentage of individuals with positive MLNs, from 54% to 27% (P <.0001). The overall incidence of positive MLN involvement was 27%, and incidence paralleled pathologic T stage (pT): pT0 = 7%, pT1 = 8%, pT2 = 22%, pT3 = 37%, and pT4 = 67%.

Impact of body mass index on outcomes and treatment-related toxicity in patients with stage II and III rectal cancer: findings from Intergroup Trial 0114.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2004-02-01,"To study the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and rates of sphincter-preserving operations, overall survival, cancer recurrence, and treatment-related toxicities in patients with rectal cancer. We evaluated a nested cohort of 1,688 patients with stage II and III rectal cancer participating in a randomized trial of postoperative fluorouracil-based chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Obese patients were more likely to undergo an abdominoperineal resection (APR) than normal-weight patients (odds ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.27 to 2.46). When analyzed by sex, increasing adiposity in men was a strong predictor of having an APR (P <.0001). Obese men with rectal cancer were also more likely than normal-weight men to have a local recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.61; 95% CI, 1.00 to 2.59). In contrast, obesity was not predictive of cancer recurrence in women, nor was BMI predictive of overall mortality in either men or women. Underweight patients had an increased risk of death (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.89) compared with normal-weight patients but no increase in cancer recurrences. Among all study participants, obese patients had a significantly lower rate of grade 3 to 4 leukopenia, neutropenia, and stomatitis and a lower rate of any grade 3 or worse toxicity when compared with normal-weight individuals. Increasing BMI in male patients with rectal cancer is associated with a decreased likelihood of sphincter preservation and a higher chance of local recurrence.

An analysis of men with clinically localized prostate cancer who deferred definitive therapy.,The Journal of urology,J.

We retrospectively reviewed prospectively entered data base records. Patients with low risk cancer who were eligible for definitive therapy but chose deferred management between 1984 and 2001 composed the cohort. Followup included regular evaluations to detect progression by prostate specific antigen (PSA), digital rectal examination, transrectal ultrasound and prostate biopsy. Objective progression was defined by a point scale of changes in prognostic factors. Definitive treatment was recommended in patients with objective progression. The cohort comprised 88 patients with clinical stages T1-2, NX0, M0 prostate cancer, a mean age of 65.3 years and a mean initial PSA of 5.9 ng/ml. Systematic biopsy, which was repeated after the initial diagnostic biopsy, showed no cancer in 61% of cases. During a median followup of 44 months 22 patients had progression. Factors that predicted progression were repeat biopsy showing cancer (p = 0.004) and initial PSA (p = 0.014). Actuarial 5 and 10-year progression-free probabilities were 67% and 55%, respectively. Of the 31 patients treated 17 underwent radical prostatectomy, 13 received radiation therapy and 1 received androgen ablation. Seven men who did not show objective progression were treated because of anxiety. Only 1 patient, who was treated with radiation therapy, had biochemical recurrence.

Patterns of morphologic alteration in residual rectal carcinoma following preoperative chemoradiation and their association with long-term outcome.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2004-02-01,"Preoperative radiation (RT) and chemotherapy improve outcome in patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma and, therefore, have been used increasingly in patient management. The histopathologic alterations in postirradiated rectal adenocarcinoma and their prognostic significance have not been fully characterized. In this study, detailed analyses of morphologic alterations of stromal and tumor cells were performed in a series of 66 posttreatment rectal carcinomas, and the pathologic findings were correlated with long-term outcome. All tumors were locally advanced, with a bulky and/or tethered tumor or endorectal ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging evidence of T3-4 and / or N1 disease. All patients were treated at one institution with preoperative RT to the pelvis (at least 4500 cGy) with or without concurrent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy 4 to 7 weeks prior to surgical resection. Pathologic assessment showed some treatment response in all patients. Nine patients (13.4%) had complete response, and 8 (11.9%) had near-complete response (> 95% of the tumor replaced by fibroinflammatory tissue). Salient morphologic features included marked fibrosis with or without prominent inflammatory cells replacing neoplastic glands; lack of active tumor necrosis; increased mucin production and mucin pools; marked cytoplasmic eosinophilia, often in combination with marked nuclear atypia but without active mitoses in tumor cells showing treatment effect; endocrine tumor phenotype; and retention of mucosal adenoma in the presence of tumor regression within the bowel wall. With a median follow-up of 69 months, the estimated 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) for the entire group was 79%. By univariate analysis, the residual tumor stage (P < 0.05) and reduction of pretreatment T stage (P = 0.002) significantly correlated with RFS, as did pN stage (P = 0.002) and lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.008). The extent of treatment response did not correlate with RFS (P = 0.4). However, patients with a treatment response > or = 95% seemed to fare better than those with a treatment response < 95% (marginally significant difference in RFS, P = 0.057). Univariate and multivariate analyses identified the following morphologic patterns that were significantly associated with a reduced RFS independent of other risk factors: a fibrotic-type stromal response with minimal inflammatory infiltrates (P = 0.001) and absence of surface ulceration (P = 0.026). Our study represents the first detailed morphologic assessment of rectal carcinomas that have been subjected to long course preoperative RT and chemotherapy.

Impact of T and N stage and treatment on survival and relapse in adjuvant rectal cancer: a pooled analysis.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2004-04-05,"To determine survival and relapse rates by T and N stage and treatment method in five randomized phase III North American rectal adjuvant studies. Data were pooled from 3,791 eligible patients enrolled onto North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) 79-47-51, NCCTG 86-47-51, US Gastrointestinal Intergroup 0114, National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) R01, and NSABP R02. Surgery alone (S) was the treatment arm in 179 patients. The remaining patients received adjuvant treatment as follows: irradiation (RT) alone (n = 281), RT + fluorouracil (FU) +/- semustine bolus chemotherapy (CT; n = 779), RT + protracted venous infusion CT (n = 325), RT + FU +/- leucovorin or levamisole bolus CT (n = 1,695), or CT alone (n = 532). Five-year follow-up was available in 94% of surviving patients, and 8-year follow-up, in 62%. Overall (OS) and disease-free survival were dependent on TN stage, NT stage, and treatment method. Even among N2 patients, T substage influenced 5-year OS (T1-2, 67%; T3, 44%; T4, 37%; P <.001). Three risk groups of patients were defined: (1) intermediate (T1-2/N1, T3/N0), (2) moderately high (T1-2/N2, T3/N1, T4/N0), and (3) high (T3/N2, T4/N1, T4/N2). For intermediate-risk patients, those receiving S plus CT had 5-year OS rates of 85% (T1-2/N1) and 84% (T3/N0), which was similar to results with S plus RT plus CT (T1-2/N1, 78% to 83%; T3/N0, 74% to 80%). For moderately high-risk lesions, 5-year OS ranged from 43% to 70% with S plus CT, and 44% to 80% with S plus RT plus CT. For high-risk lesions, 5-year OS ranged from 25% to 45% with S plus CT, and 29% to 57% with S plus RT plus CT.

Adjuvant therapy for rectal cancer in the elderly.,Drugs & aging,Drugs Aging,2004-01-01,"Rectal cancer, like most malignancies, is a disease of older age. By the year 2030, nearly 70% of all cancer patients are expected to be over the age of 65 years. Adjuvant therapy for colorectal cancer has been one of the most important contributions of medical oncology to the health of the population, saving more lives annually than more effective therapy for less common cancers, such as Hodgkin's disease. Nonetheless, population-based studies have shown that less than half of those over the age of 65 years receive the standard adjuvant therapy for rectal cancer. In many instances, there may be legitimate reasons for this, but efforts must be made to overcome any age bias and nihilism in the use of adjuvant therapy in the treatment of rectal cancer in the elderly. Although the elderly have been under-represented in clinical trials, they have been shown to tolerate cancer treatment and derive benefit from the adjuvant therapies. Despite early reports to the contrary, older patients have been shown to tolerate surgical resections for rectal cancer as well as their younger counterparts.

A current perspective on local excision of rectal cancer.,Clinical colorectal cancer,Clin Colorectal Cancer,2004-05-01,"Local excision of rectal cancer is appealing because of its technical ease and excellent functional results, but concern over inadequate pathologic staging and inferior treatment outcomes when compared with radical surgery remain a major hurdle for its widespread use. Local failure rates in modern series for local excision are 4%-18% for T1 rectal cancers and 22%-67% for T2 cancers, and cancer cure rates are only 70%-80%. In addition, data from the past decade suggest that preoperative staging with endorectal ultrasound, use of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy/radiation therapy, and aggressive salvage surgery have not been reliable methods of limiting local tumor recurrence or improving long-term cure rates. At present, highly stringent criteria for patient selection are recommended, yet such stringency decreases the utility of the procedure. What are needed are new approaches to an old problem. Novel strategies under evaluation include enhanced imaging modalities for lymph node metastases, neoadjuvant chemotherapy/radiation therapy, and more liberal use of immediate salvage resection for high-risk pathologic features. Molecular profiling of tumors with genetic markers and better integration of traditional and gene-targeted systemic therapy are promising approaches for the future.

FDG-PET parameters included maximum standard uptake value (SUV(max)), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), and visual response score. Patients were prospectively followed after operation, and disease status was determined. All patients demonstrated some degree of response to preoperative therapy based on pathologic examination. At a median followup of 42 months (range 23 to 54 months), 11 patients had no evidence of disease and 4 had died of disease. The mean percentage decrease in SUV(max) (DeltaSUV(max)) was 69% for patients free from recurrence and 37% for patients with recurrence (p = 0.004). DeltaSUV(max) >or= 62.5 and deltaTLG >or= 69.5 were the best predictors of no-evidence-of-disease status and freedom from recurrence. Patients with DeltaSUV(max) >or= 62.5 and deltaTLG >or= 69.5 had significantly improved disease-specific and recurrence-free survival (p = 0.08, 0.02 and p = 0.03, 0.01, respectively).

Prostate cancer screening: clinical applications and challenges.,Urologic oncology,Urol. Oncol.,,"Prostate cancer is a serious illness warranting appropriate screening measures. However, current screening tests that include prostate-specific antigen and digital rectal examination must be proven to save lives to be considered truly legitimate and appropriate public health tools. Even though these tests are associated with the diagnosis of disease, important questions remain as to how well these tests identify all disease and whether screening leads to interventions that save lives. Prostate cancer is undoubtedly a killer, yet there appear to be large numbers of detectable prostate cancers that are of little threat to life. Some men with this grade of cancer receive curative treatment, even though their disease does not require treatment. Some studies suggest that more than three of four men with screen-detected localized disease may not need treatment. One of the great challenges of cancer communications is how to convey the hope of prostate cancer screening while adequately acknowledging the boundaries of our knowledge.

Prostate cancer detection on urinalysis for alpha methylacyl coenzyme a racemase protein.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2004-10-01,"We assessed the feasibility of a novel urinary test for prostate cancer based on the presence of alpha methylacyl coenzyme A racemase (AMACR) protein in voided urine specimens obtained after prostate biopsy. Clean catch voided urine specimens were prospectively collected from 26 consecutive men immediately after transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy for suspected malignancy. The presence of AMACR was evaluated in a blinded manner by Western blot analysis and correlated with biopsy results and patient clinical information. AMACR was detected in the urine in 18 of 26 patients (69%). AMACR was detected in all 12 patients with biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate (100% sensitivity, 95% CI 75 to 100), in 5 of 12 with no evidence of cancer on biopsy (58% specificity, 95% CI 29 to 78) and in 1 of 2 (50%, 95% CI 3 to 80) with atypia on biopsy. Overall AMACR detection was associated with cancer status by prostate biopsy in 21 of 26 patients (86%). We report the feasibility of a novel, noninvasive, nonprostate specific antigen based molecular approach to detect prostate cancer in voided urine.

Transrectal ultrasound versus magnetic resonance imaging for detection of rectal wall invasion by prostate cancer.,The Prostate,Prostate,2005-01-01,"This study compared the accuracy of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) versus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the detection of rectal wall involvement by prostate cancer in patients undergoing salvage total pelvic exenteration (TPE) or cystoprostatectomy. We identified 16 patients who underwent TPE and 24 patients who underwent cystoprostatectomy for locally advanced prostate cancer as salvage procedures with palliative intent. Patients were examined by TRUS, MRI, or both within the month preceding surgery. Histologic evidence of rectal involvement with prostate cancer was considered the gold standard diagnostic criterion in patients undergoing TPE. Among patients undergoing cystoprostatectomy, posterior prostatic surgical margins and clinical evidence of rectal wall recurrence during a median follow-up duration of 18.6 months were considered the gold standard. The sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy with which TRUS and MRI detected rectal wall involvement were compared. Fifteen (93.7%) of the patients who underwent TPE had histologically-proven rectal wall involvement with prostate cancer. Rectal and perineal recurrence developed 10 months after surgery in 1 (4.1%) patient in the cystoprostatectomy group. The sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of TRUS were: 92.9 (66.1-99.8), 87.0 (66.4-97.2), and 89.2 (74.6-97.0), respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of MRI were: 54.6 (23.4-83.3), 100 (76.8-100.0), and 80 (59.3-93.2), respectively.

Long-term results using local excision after preoperative chemoradiation among selected T3 rectal cancer patients.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2004-11-01,"To assess the pelvic failure among patients with T3 rectal cancer treated with local excision after preoperative chemoradiation. Between January 1990 and June 2002, 431 patients with clinically staged T3 rectal cancer were treated with preoperative chemoradiation followed by surgical resection. Full-thickness local excision [Kraske (n = 3) or a transanal excision (n = 23)] was performed in 26 patients because of patient refusal of abdominoperineal resection (APR) (n = 13), medical comorbidity (n = 4), physician preference after a complete clinical response (n = 6), and other reasons (n = 3). All patients were treated with continuous-infusion 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (300 mg/m(2) Monday to Friday) and concomitant pelvic radiation (45 Gy in 25 fractions with a 3-field belly board technique). Ten local-excision patients received a concomitant boost during the last week of therapy (1.5-Gy second daily fractions) for a total dose of 52.5 Gy. Similar preoperative treatment was followed by total mesorectal excision in 405 patients. Among the local-excision patients, the median tumor size was 3.5 cm (range, 0.5-7 cm). Well-differentiated or moderately-differentiated histology was present in all but 3 cases, and endoscopic ultrasound staging examination was performed in 25 of 26 patients. Based on CT findings, 1 patient was node positive. The median circumference involved by tumor was 33%, (20%-75%). The median distance from the anal verge was 3 cm (range, 1-8 cm). The mean follow-up was 46 months (range, 5-109 months) in the local-excision group. In the local-excision group, 19 of 26 patients had only residual scarring noted on digital rectal examination and rigid proctoscopy before surgery. Fourteen patients (54%) had a complete histologic response to chemoradiation, 9 patients (35%) had microscopic residual disease, and 3 patients (12%) had gross residual disease. Two intrapelvic recurrences occurred at 76 and 20 months among the 26 patients treated with local excision (6% 5-year actuarial pelvic recurrence rate). This rate compared with an 8% 5-year actuarial pelvic recurrence rate among T3 patients treated with mesorectal excision and a 6% pelvic recurrence rate in the subgroup of mesorectal-excision patients with a complete clinical response to preoperative chemoradiation. One additional local-excision patient recurred in an inguinal lymph node after local excision and subsequently died of metastatic disease. A total of 2 local-excision patients died of metastatic rectal cancer. Actuarial overall survival at 5 years was 86% in the local-excision group compared with 81% among mesorectal-excision patients (p = NS), and 85% in patients with a complete clinical response to chemoradiation followed by mesorectal excision by APR or LAR (p = NS). In an experience stimulated by patient refusal of APR, highly selected patients who responded well to conventional external-beam radiotherapy (CXRT) were selected to undergo local excision. Most of these patients had pathologic complete response. Local control and survival rates are comparable to those achieved with chemoradiation followed by mesorectal excision. This strategy should be prospectively studied in a group of patients with low rectal cancer who have no clinical evidence of tumor after chemoradiation.",Journal Article,5559.0,165.0,To assess the

Expression of p27 in residual rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiation predicts long-term outcome.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2004-10-15,"Compared with surgery alone, preoperative radiotherapy and 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (combined-modality therapy; CMT) improves outcomes in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Although numerous studies have focused on identifying molecular markers of prognosis in the primary rectal cancer before CMT, our aim was to identify markers of prognosis in residual rectal cancer after preoperative CMT. Sixty-seven patients with locally advanced (T3-4 and/or N1) rectal cancer were treated with preoperative radiotherapy (median, 5040 cGy) with or without 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. Residual tumor in the resected specimen, available for 52 patients, was analyzed for tumor-node-metastasis stage, lymphovascular and/or perineural invasion, and immunohistochemical expression of p27, p21, p53, Ki-67, retinoblastoma gene, cyclin D1, and bcl-2. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test. With a median follow-up of 69 months, the overall 5-year RFS was 74%. RFS was significantly worse for patients with positive p27 expression (P = .005), T3-4 tumors (P = .02), and positive lymph nodes (P = .04) in the irradiated specimen. On multivariate analysis, positive p27 expression remained an independent negative prognostic factor for RFS (P = .04). None of the other proteins was significantly associated with RFS.

Morbidity and functional outcomes of salvage radical prostatectomy for locally recurrent prostate cancer after radiation therapy.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2004-12-01,"Few patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer after external beam (EB) or interstitial (I) radiotherapy (RT) are considered candidates for salvage radical prostatectomy (RP) due to high reported rates of major complications and urinary incontinence. We report the morbidity associated with salvage RP in 100 consecutive patients. From 1984 to 2003 salvage RP was performed for recurrent prostate cancer following EBRT in 58 cases, and IRT in 42 (28 retropubic) and (14 transperineal). Clinical information was obtained from a prospective database. Since 1993, the major complication rate has decreased significantly (13% vs 33%, p = 0.02), including the rectal injury rate (2% vs 15%, p = 0.01). Compared with retropubic IRT and/or pre-radiotherapy pelvic lymph node dissection the risk of major complications following EBRT or transperineal IRT was significantly less (OR 0.2, p = 0.006). At 5 years an estimated 39% of patients were dry and 68% required 1 pad daily or less. A total of 23 patients with moderate-severe incontinence underwent artificial sphincter placement. The anastomotic stricture rate was 30%. The 5-year potency rate was 28% following unilateral or bilateral nerve sparing RP and 45% in previously potent patients. Due to patient selection the major complication rate after salvage RP has improved significantly with time and it is similar to that of standard RP. Rates of anastomotic stricture and moderate to severe incontinence are higher than those observed after standard RP. However, most patients recover reasonable urinary continence and a substantial number of select patients recover potency. The acceptable morbidity profile of salvage RP following EBRT and transperineal IRT should persuade more physicians to consider patients for this potentially curative procedure.",Journal Article,5529.0,179.0,Few patients with locally recurrent cancer after external beam EB or interstitial I radiotherapy RT are considered candidates for salvage radical prostatectomy RP due to high reported rates of major complications and urinary incontinence We report the morbidity associated with salvage RP in 100 consecutive patients From 1984 to 2003 salvage RP was performed for recurrent cancer following EBRT in 58 cases and IRT in 42 28 retropubic and 14 transperineal Clinical information was obtained from a prospective database Since 1993 the major complication rate has decreased significantly 13 vs 33 p 0.02 including the injury rate 2 vs 15 p 0.01 Compared with retropubic IRT and/or pre-radiotherapy pelvic lymph node dissection the risk of major complications following EBRT or transperineal IRT was significantly less OR 0.2 p 0.006 At 5 years an estimated 39 of patients were dry and 68 required 1 pad daily or less A total of 23 patients with moderate-severe incontinence underwent artificial sphincter placement The anastomotic stricture rate was 30 The 5-year potency rate was 28 following unilateral or bilateral nerve sparing RP and 45 in previously potent patients Due to patient selection the major complication rate after salvage RP has improved significantly with time and it is similar to that of standard RP Rates of anastomotic stricture and moderate to severe incontinence are higher than those observed after standard RP However most patients recover reasonable urinary continence and a substantial number of select patients recover potency The acceptable morbidity profile of salvage RP following EBRT and transperineal IRT should persuade more physicians to consider patients for this potentially curative procedure,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[1021, 7, 5, 795, 387, 12, 50, 1455, 1345, 13794, 15, 4543, 70, 310, 240, 32, 515, 1931, 9, 992, 711, 1202, 1622, 520, 6, 64, 210, 151, 1, 458, 521, 2, 1660, 6152, 21, 414, 3, 787, 41, 5, 992, 1622, 4, 394, 935, 7, 29, 6036, 6, 1522, 992, 1622, 10, 173, 9, 387, 12, 366, 1883, 4, 717, 140, 2, 18994, 4, 595, 339, 8359, 2, 213, 16801, 38, 487, 10, 683, 29, 8, 482, 609, 1192, 3343, 3, 458, 1447, 116, 71, 340, 97, 233, 105, 466, 19, 13, 588, 141, 3, 2730, 116, 18, 105, 167, 19, 13, 355, 72, 5, 8359, 18994, 2, 15, 671, 310, 1110, 263, 289, 1161, 3, 43, 1, 458, 521, 366, 1883, 15, 16801, 18994, 10, 97, 299, 15, 13, 18, 19, 13, 1861, 28, 33, 60, 35, 661, 587, 1, 7, 11, 7922, 2, 806, 616, 14, 9121, 391, 15, 299, 8, 181, 1, 382, 7, 5, 1163, 905, 6152, 208, 8757, 5400, 2613, 3, 4818, 6673, 116, 10, 201, 3, 33, 111, 3593, 116, 10, 339, 366, 3208, 15, 1607, 2476, 1851, 1622, 2, 512, 4, 373, 1157, 7, 520, 6, 69, 881, 3, 458, 1447, 116, 50, 992, 1622, 71, 231, 97, 5, 98, 2, 192, 16, 288, 6, 17, 1, 260, 1622, 151, 1, 4818, 6673, 2, 1163, 6, 905, 6152, 32, 142, 76, 135, 164, 50, 260, 1622, 137, 96, 7, 9966, 3203, 1660, 7094, 2, 8, 1281, 207, 1, 1717, 7, 9966, 3593, 3, 1595, 787, 800, 1, 992, 1622, 366, 1883, 2, 16801, 18994, 257, 37809, 80, 1261, 6, 2419, 7, 9, 26, 751, 1075, 1299]",1730.0,15538239,188

Colon Rectum,2004-10-01,"This study was designed to identify preoperative and intraoperative features of locally recurrent colorectal cancer that predict R0 resection in patients scheduled for attempted complete resection followed by intraoperative radiation therapy. Review of a prospective data base identified 119 patients brought to the intraoperative radiation therapy suite for planned complete resection of locally recurrent rectal (n = 101) and colon (n = 18) cancer between January 1994 and November 2000. R0 resection was achieved in 61 patients. This group was compared with patients in which an R1 (n = 38), R2 (n = 7), or palliative procedure (n = 13) was performed. Variables evaluated included: tumor location, features of the primary tumor, and preoperative findings on computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and history/physical. Tumor location was established by review of operative/pathologic reports and classified as axial (anastomotic/perineal), anterior (bladder/genitourinary organs), posterior (presacral), or lateral (pelvic sidewall). When recurrence was confined to the axial location only, or axial and anterior locations, R0 resection was achieved significantly more often than when other locations were involved (P < 0.001, P = 0.003, respectively). When a lateral component was present, R0 resection was achieved significantly less often than when there was no lateral component (P = 0.002). For patients with available preoperative computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging results (n = 70), the finding of lateral tumor involvement was associated with R0 resection significantly less often than when lateral disease was not identified (P = 0.004).

Validation of a nomogram for predicting positive repeat biopsy for prostate cancer.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2005-02-01,"We reported a nomogram and subsequently a corrected version for predicting the probability of positive biopsy in men with 1 or more prior negative biopsies. In this study we assessed the validity of this nomogram when applied to an external dataset. There were 230 patients from the Brooklyn Veterans Administration Medical Center who underwent 1 or more repeat biopsies after initial negative biopsy from January 1993 to June 2003. Predictor variables studied in the nomogram were patient age, family history of prostate cancer, digital rectal examination, serum prostate specific antigen, prostate specific antigen slope, months from initial negative biopsy session, months from previous negative biopsy session, cumulative number of negative cores previously taken and history of high grade intraepithelial neoplasm or atypical small acinar proliferation. We calculated the nomogram predicted probability in each patient. These predicted outcomes were compared with actual biopsy results. Area under the ROC curve was calculated as a measure of discrimination. Calibration was assessed graphically. We evaluated a total of 356 repeat biopsies in 230 patients (mean 2.56 total biopsies per patient). The mean number of total cores per patient was 17.9. There were 78 positive biopsies.

Epidermal growth factor receptor gene polymorphisms predict pelvic recurrence in patients with rectal cancer treated with chemoradiation.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2005-01-01,"An association between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway and response of cancer cells to ionizing radiation has been reported. Recently, a polymorphic variant in the EGFR gene that leads to an arginine-to-lysine substitution in the extracellular domain at codon 497 within subdomain IV of EGFR has been identified. The variant EGFR (HER-1 497K) may lead to attenuation in ligand binding, growth stimulation, tyrosine kinase activation, and induction of proto-oncogenes myc, fos, and jun. A (CA)(n) repeat polymorphism in intron 1 of the EGFR gene that alters EGFR expression in vitro and in vivo has also been described. In the current pilot study, we assessed both polymorphisms in 59 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy using PCR-RFLP and a 5'-end [gamma-(33)P]ATP-labeled PCR protocol. We tested whether either polymorphism alone or in combination can be associated with local recurrence in the setting of chemoradiation treatment. We found that patients with HER-1 497 Arg/Arg genotype or lower number of CA repeats (both alleles <20) tended to have a higher risk of local recurrence (P = 0.24 and 0.31, respectively). Combined analysis showed the highest risk for local recurrence was seen in patients who possessed both a HER-1 497 Arg allele and <20 CA repeats (P = 0.05, log-rank test). Our data suggest that the HER-1 R497K and EGFR intron 1 (CA)(n) repeat polymorphisms may be potential indicators of radiosensitivity in patients with rectal cancer treated with chemoradiation.",Journal Article,5498.0,74.0,An association between epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR signaling pathway and response of cancer cells to ionizing radiation has been reported Recently a polymorphic variant in the EGFR gene that leads to an arginine-to-lysine substitution in the extracellular domain at codon 497 within subdomain IV of EGFR has been identified The variant EGFR HER-1 497K may lead to attenuation in ligand binding growth stimulation tyrosine kinase activation and induction of proto-oncogenes myc fos and jun A CA n repeat polymorphism in intron 1 of the EGFR gene that alters EGFR expression in vitro and in vivo has also been described In the current pilot study we assessed both polymorphisms in 59 patients with locally advanced cancer treated with adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy using PCR-RFLP and a 5'-end gamma- 33 P ATP-labeled PCR protocol We tested whether either polymorphism alone or in combination can be associated with local recurrence in the setting of chemoradiation treatment We found that patients with HER-1 497 Arg/Arg genotype or lower number of CA repeats both alleles 20 tended to have a higher risk of local recurrence P 0.24 and 0.31 respectively Combined analysis showed the highest risk for local recurrence was seen in patients who possessed both a HER-1 497 Arg allele and 20 CA repeats P 0.05 log-rank test Our data suggest that the HER-1 R497K and EGFR intron 1 CA n repeat polymorphisms may be potential indicators of radiosensitivity in patients with cancer treated with chemoradiation,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[35, 248, 59, 829, 129, 161, 153, 227, 314, 308, 2, 51, 1, 12, 37, 6, 4341, 121, 71, 85, 210, 761, 8, 7087, 1142, 4, 3, 227, 145, 17, 1940, 6, 35, 5392, 6, 6041, 5029, 4, 3, 1976, 1398, 28, 3673, 11178, 262, 33817, 478, 1, 227, 71, 85, 108, 3, 1142, 227, 1084, 14, 54597, 68, 1122, 6, 5349, 4, 1232, 791, 129, 2503, 564, 216, 363, 2, 504, 1, 4976, 3326, 1371, 9737, 2, 4578, 8, 1568, 78, 2334, 1907, 4, 6259, 14, 1, 3, 227, 145, 17, 6745, 227, 55, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 71, 120, 85, 1027, 4, 3, 291, 2281, 45, 21, 275, 110, 1203, 4, 728, 7, 5, 795, 131, 12, 73, 5, 249, 15, 536, 975, 36, 75, 604, 11952, 2, 8, 7344, 396, 1705, 466, 19, 3918, 2841, 604, 1182, 21, 650, 317, 361, 1907, 279, 15, 4, 150, 122, 40, 41, 5, 293, 146, 4, 3, 546, 1, 975, 24, 21, 204, 17, 7, 5, 1084, 14, 11178, 7844, 7844, 1183, 15, 280, 207, 1, 1568, 7197, 110, 2558, 179, 3886, 6, 47, 8, 142, 43, 1, 293, 146, 19, 13, 259, 2, 13, 456, 106, 397, 65, 224, 3, 1076, 43, 9, 293, 146, 10, 527, 4, 7, 54, 10966, 110, 8, 1084, 14, 11178, 7844, 1254, 2, 179, 1568, 7197, 19, 13, 474, 1066, 1026, 412, 114, 74, 309, 17, 3, 1084, 14, 28350, 2, 227, 6259, 14, 1568, 78, 2334, 1203, 68, 40, 174, 3539, 1, 5850, 4, 7, 5, 12, 73, 5, 975]",1525.0,15701846,45

Cohort studies have not revealed such an association but were limited in size. We explored the association between consumption of coffee and tea and the incidence of colorectal cancer in two large prospective cohorts of women and men. We used data from the Nurses' Health Study (women) and the Health Professionals' Follow-up Study (men). Consumption of coffee and tea and total caffeine intake were assessed and updated in 1980, 1984, 1986, 1990, and 1994 among women and in 1986, 1990, and 1994 among men. The incidence of cancer of the colon or rectum was ascertained through 1998. Hazard ratios were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models that adjusted for potential confounders. All tests of statistical significance were two-sided. During almost 2 million person-years of follow-up, 1438 cases of colorectal cancer were observed. Consumption of caffeinated coffee or tea with caffeine or caffeine intake was not associated with the incidence of colon or rectal cancer in either cohort. For both cohorts combined, the covariate-adjusted hazard ratio for colorectal cancer associated with consumption of each additional cup of caffeinated coffee was 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.96 to 1.03). However, participants who regularly consumed two or more cups of decaffeinated coffee per day had a 52% (95% CI = 19% to 71%) lower incidence of rectal cancer than those who never consumed decaffeinated coffee.

Improved detection of prostate cancer using classification and regression tree analysis.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2005-03-21,"To build a decision tree for patients suspected of having prostate cancer using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. Data were uniformly collected on 1,433 referred men with a serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of < or = 10 ng/mL who underwent a prostate biopsy. Factors analyzed included demographic, laboratory, and ultrasound data (ie, hypoechoic lesions and PSA density [PSAD]). Twenty percent of the data was randomly selected and reserved for study validation. CART analysis was performed in two steps, initially using PSA and digital rectal examination (DRE) alone and subsequently using the remaining variables. CART analysis selected a PSA cutoff of more than 1.55 ng/mL for further work-up, regardless of DRE findings. CART then selected the following subgroups at risk for a positive biopsy: (1) PSAD more than 0.165 ng/mL/cc; (2) PSAD < or = 0.165 ng/mL/cc and a hypoechoic lesion; (3) PSAD < or = 0.165 ng/mL/cc, no hypoechoic lesions, age older than 55.5 years, and prostate volume < or = 44.0 cc; and (4) PSAD < or = 0.165 ng/mL/cc, no hypoechoic lesions, age older than 55.5 years, and 50.25 cc less than prostate volume < or = 80.8 cc.

Surgical salvage of recurrent rectal cancer after transanal excision.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2005-06-01,"This study examines surgical salvage of locally recurrent rectal cancer following transanal excision of early tumors. Through retrospective review of a colorectal database we identified 50 patients who underwent attempted surgical salvage for local recurrence following initial transanal excision of T1 or T2 rectal cancer. Eight patients had resectable synchronous distant disease. Clinicopathologic variables were associated with extent of surgery required for salvage and outcome. Salvage procedures included abdominoperineal resection (31), low anterior resection (11), total pelvic exenteration (4), and transanal excision (3). One patient had unresectable disease at exploration, requiring diverting ostomy. Of the 49 patients who underwent successful salvage, 27 (55 percent) required an extended pelvic dissection with en bloc resection of one or more of the following structures: pelvic sidewall and autonomic nerves (18); coccyx or portion of sacrum (6); prostate (5); seminal vesicle (5); bladder (4); portion of the vagina (3); ureter (2); ovary (1); and uterus (1). Complete pathologic resection (R0) was accomplished in 47 of 49 patients. Of the eight patients with distant and local recurrence, two underwent synchronous resection and six had delayed metastasectomy. With a median follow-up of 33 months, 29 patients had recurred or died of disease at the time of this analysis. Five-year disease-specific survival was 53 percent. Factors predictive of survival included evidence of any mucosal recurrence on endoscopy, low presalvage carcinoembryonic antigen, and absence of poor pathologic features (lymphovascular and perineural invasion). Patients who required an extended pelvic resection had a worse survival rate. Pelvic recurrence following transanal excision of early rectal cancer is often locally advanced, requiring an extended pelvic dissection with en bloc resection of adjacent pelvic organs to achieve salvage. The long-term outcome in patients undergoing resection is less than expected, considering the early stage of their initial disease. When contemplating local excision for early rectal cancer, the risk of local recurrence, the extent and morbidity of surgery required for salvage, and the modest cure rate following salvage should be considered.",Journal Article,5347.0,135.0,This study examines surgical salvage of locally recurrent cancer following transanal excision of early tumors Through retrospective review of a database we identified 50 patients who underwent attempted surgical salvage for local recurrence following initial transanal excision of T1 or T2 cancer Eight patients had resectable synchronous distant disease Clinicopathologic variables were associated with extent of surgery required for salvage and outcome Salvage procedures included abdominoperineal resection 31 low anterior resection 11 total pelvic exenteration 4 and transanal excision 3 One patient had unresectable disease at exploration requiring diverting ostomy Of the 49 patients who underwent successful salvage 27 55 percent required an extended pelvic dissection with en bloc resection of one or more of the following structures pelvic sidewall and autonomic nerves 18 coccyx or portion of sacrum 6 5 seminal vesicle 5 4 portion of the vagina 3 ureter 2 ovary 1 and 1 Complete pathologic resection R0 was accomplished in 47 of 49 patients Of the eight patients with distant and local recurrence two underwent synchronous resection and six had delayed metastasectomy With a median follow-up of 33 months 29 patients had recurred or died of disease at the time of this analysis Five-year disease-specific survival was 53 percent Factors predictive of survival included evidence of any mucosal recurrence on endoscopy low presalvage carcinoembryonic antigen and absence of poor pathologic features lymphovascular and perineural invasion Patients who required an extended pelvic resection had a worse survival rate Pelvic recurrence following transanal excision of early cancer is often locally advanced requiring an extended pelvic dissection with en bloc resection of adjacent pelvic organs to achieve salvage The long-term outcome in patients undergoing resection is less than expected considering the early stage of their initial disease When contemplating local excision for early cancer the risk of local recurrence the extent and morbidity of surgery required for salvage and the modest cure rate following salvage should be considered,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[26, 45, 4468, 221, 992, 1, 795, 387, 12, 366, 11825, 1366, 1, 191, 57, 298, 459, 206, 1, 8, 609, 21, 108, 212, 7, 54, 208, 4098, 221, 992, 9, 293, 146, 366, 388, 11825, 1366, 1, 1534, 15, 1786, 12, 659, 7, 42, 1899, 2734, 626, 34, 1399, 682, 11, 41, 5, 1039, 1, 152, 616, 9, 992, 2, 228, 992, 1369, 159, 8177, 170, 456, 154, 2882, 170, 175, 181, 1110, 5668, 39, 2, 11825, 1366, 27, 104, 69, 42, 1468, 34, 28, 3370, 1888, 15107, 15565, 1, 3, 739, 7, 54, 208, 1401, 992, 428, 614, 714, 616, 35, 1747, 1110, 1161, 5, 4375, 5590, 170, 1, 104, 15, 80, 1, 3, 366, 2414, 1110, 12599, 2, 12805, 6721, 203, 43903, 15, 3206, 1, 11629, 49, 33, 4786, 5608, 33, 39, 3206, 1, 3, 7553, 27, 9775, 18, 3631, 14, 2, 14, 236, 510, 170, 2328, 10, 5741, 4, 662, 1, 739, 7, 1, 3, 659, 7, 5, 626, 2, 293, 146, 100, 208, 2734, 170, 2, 437, 42, 1612, 4452, 5, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 466, 53, 462, 7, 42, 3363, 15, 1016, 1, 34, 28, 3, 98, 1, 26, 65, 365, 111, 34, 112, 25, 10, 699, 714, 130, 464, 1, 25, 159, 241, 1, 500, 3068, 146, 23, 4199, 154, 19009, 5139, 448, 2, 1127, 1, 334, 510, 404, 2933, 2, 4917, 578, 7, 54, 616, 35, 1747, 1110, 170, 42, 8, 639, 25, 116, 1110, 146, 366, 11825, 1366, 1, 191, 12, 16, 629, 795, 131, 1888, 35, 1747, 1110, 1161, 5, 4375, 5590, 170, 1, 2086, 1110, 2285, 6, 1359, 992, 3, 319, 337, 228, 4, 7, 479, 170, 16, 299, 76, 1336, 3075, 3, 191, 82, 1, 136, 388, 34, 198, 28027, 293, 1366, 9, 191, 12, 3, 43, 1, 293, 146, 3, 1039, 2, 787, 1, 152, 616, 9, 992, 2, 3, 1721, 1722, 116, 366, 992, 257, 40, 515]",2151.0,15793645,10

We documented 1,719 distal colorectal adenoma cases (705 large adenomas, 897 small adenomas, 1,280 distal colon adenomas, and 505 rectal adenomas) during 18 years of follow-up.

"Fiber intake and incidence of colorectal cancer among 76,947 women and 47,279 men.","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev.,2005-04-01,"Prospective cohort studies have consistently found no important link between fiber intake and risk of colorectal cancer. The recent large, prospective European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition has challenged this paradigm by suggesting significant protection by high fiber intake. We prospectively investigated the association of fiber intake with the incidence of colon and rectal cancers in two large cohorts: the Nurses' Health Study (76,947 women) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (47,279 men). Diet was assessed repeatedly in 1984, 1986, 1990, and 1994 among women and in 1986, 1990, and 1994 among men. The incidence of cancer of the colon and rectum was ascertained up to the year 2000. Relative risk estimates were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model simultaneously controlling for potential confounding variables. During follow-up including 1.8 million person-years and 1,596 cases of colorectal cancer, we found little association with fiber intake after controlling for confounding variables. The hazard ratio for a 5-g/d increase in fiber intake was 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.87-0.95) after adjusting for covariates used in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study and 0.99 (95% confidence interval, 0.95-1.04) after adjusting for additional confounding variables.

Long-term oncologic outcome following preoperative combined modality therapy and total mesorectal excision of locally advanced rectal cancer.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2005-05-01,"Our aims were to (1) determine the long-term oncologic outcome for patients with rectal cancer treated with preoperative combined modality therapy (CMT) followed by total mesorectal excision (TME), (2) identify factors predictive of oncologic outcome, and (3) determine the oncologic significance of the extent of pathologic tumor response. Locally advanced (T3-4 and/or N1) rectal adenocarcinoma is commonly treated with preoperative CMT and TME. However, the long-term oncologic results of this approach and factors predictive of a durable outcome remain largely unknown. Two hundred ninety-seven consecutive patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma at a median distance of 6 cm from the anal verge (range 0-15 cm) were treated with preoperative CMT (radiation: 5040 centi-Gray (cGy) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy) followed by TME from 1988 to 2002. A prospectively collected database was queried for long-term oncologic outcome and predictive clinicopathologic factors. With a median follow-up of 44 months, the estimated 10-year overall survival (OS) was 58% and 10 year recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 62%. On multivariate analysis, pathologic response >95%, lymphovascular invasion and/or perineural invasion (PNI), and positive lymph nodes were significantly associated with OS and RFS. Patients with a >95% pathologic response had a significantly improved OS (P = 0.003) and RFS (P = 0.002). Treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer with preoperative CMT followed by TME can provide for a durable 10-year OS of 58% and RFS of 62%.

Comparison between CT-based volumetric calculations and ICRU reference-point estimates of radiation doses delivered to bladder and rectum during intracavitary radiotherapy for cervical cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2005-05-01,"To compare CT-based volumetric calculations and International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) reference-point estimates of radiation doses to the bladder and rectum in patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix treated with definitive low-dose-rate intracavitary radiotherapy (ICRT). Between November 2001 and March 2003, 60 patients were prospectively enrolled in a pilot study of ICRT with CT-based dosimetry. Most patients underwent two ICRT insertions. After insertion of an afterloading ICRT applicator, intraoperative orthogonal films were obtained to ensure proper positioning of the system and to facilitate subsequent planning. Treatments were prescribed using standard two-dimensional dosimetry and planning. Patients also underwent helical CT of the pelvis for three-dimensional reconstruction of the radiation dose distributions. The systems were loaded with 137Cs sources using the Selectron remote afterloading system according to institutional practice for low-dose-rate brachytherapy. Three-dimensional dose distributions were generated using the Varian BrachyVision treatment planning system. The rectum was contoured from the bottom of the ischial tuberosities to the sigmoid flexure. The entire bladder was contoured. The minimal doses delivered to the 2 cm3 of bladder and rectum receiving the highest dose (DBV2 and DRV2, respectively) were determined from dose-volume histograms, and these estimates were compared with two-dimensionally derived estimates of the doses to the corresponding ICRU reference points. A total of 118 unique intracavitary insertions were performed, and 93 were evaluated and the subject of this analysis. For the rectum, the estimated doses to the ICRU reference point did not differ significantly from the DRV2 (p = 0.561); the mean (+/- standard deviation) difference was 21 cGy (+/- 344 cGy). The median volume of the rectum that received at least the ICRU reference-point dose was 2.1 cm3. In 66 (71%) of 93 cases, <5 cm3 was treated to this dose. However, for the bladder, the estimated doses to the ICRU reference point were significantly lower than the D(BV2) (p <0.001); the mean difference was 680 cGy (+/- 543 cGy). The median volume of the bladder that received at least the ICRU reference-point dose was 13.0 cm3. Our data suggest that the estimated dose to the ICRU rectal point may be a reasonable surrogate for the DRV2. However, this result may not be applicable to other treatment guidelines and ICRT applicator systems. In contrast, the dose to the ICRU bladder point does not appear to be a reasonable surrogate for the DBV2.

Neoplastic meningitis in patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract.,Cancer,Cancer,2005-06-01,"Neoplastic meningitis (NM) occurs in 5-10% of patients with malignant disease. Little is known about the outcomes of patients with gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies who develop NM. For this report, the authors characterized the clinical course and attempted to identify prognostic factors in patients with NM due to primary malignancies of the GI tract. In this retrospective study, 21 patients with GI primary tumors and NM were identified: Their medical records and imaging studies were reviewed. The patient population was composed of patients with gastric adenocarcinoma (n = 8 patients), esophageal adenocarcinoma (n = 7 patients), colon and/or rectal adenocarcinoma (n = 5 patients), and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n = 1 patient). The median overall survival after the initial diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was 55 weeks (range, 8-884 wks), and the median survival after the diagnosis of NM was 7 weeks (range, 0-64 wks). Four patients died during palliative radiotherapy. No factors identified had an impact on outcome, including symptoms, physical findings at diagnosis, imaging characteristics, or cerebrospinal fluid findings.

The development of a validated instrument to evaluate bowel function after sphincter-preserving surgery for rectal cancer.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2005-07-01,"Sphincter-preserving surgery is technically feasible for many rectal cancers, but functional results are not well understood. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop an instrument to evaluate bowel function after sphincter-preserving surgery. A 41-item bowel function survey was developed from a literature review, expert opinions, and 59 patient interviews. An additional 184 patients who underwent sphincter-preserving surgery between 1997 and 2001 were asked to complete the survey and quality-of-life instruments (Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ 30/Colorectal Cancer 38). A factor analysis of variance was performed. Test-retest reliability was evaluated, with 20 patients completing two surveys within a mean of 11 days. Validity testing was done with clinical variables (gender, age, radiation, length of time from surgery), surgical variables (procedure: local excision, low anterior resection, coloanal anastomosis), reconstruction (J-pouch, straight), anastomosis (handsewn, stapled), and quality-of-life instruments. The survey response rate was 70.1 percent (129/184). Among the 127 patients with usable data, 67 percent were male, the median age was 64 (range, 38-87) years, and the mean time for restoration of bowel continuity after sphincter-preserving surgery was 22.9 months. Patients had a median of 3.5 stools/day (range, 0-30), and 37 percent were dissatisfied with their bowel function. Patients experienced a median of 22 symptoms (range, 7-32), with 27 percent reported as severe, 37 percent as moderate, and 36 percent as mild. The five most common symptoms were incomplete evacuation (96.8 percent), clustering (94.4 percent), food affecting frequency (93.2 percent), unformed stool (92.8 percent), and gas incontinence (91.8 percent). The factor analysis identified 14 items that collapsed into three subscales: FREQUENCY (alpha = 0.75), DIETARY (alpha = 0.78), and SOILAGE (alpha = 0.79), with acceptable test-retest reliability for the three subscales and total score (0.62-0.87). The instrument detected differences between patients with preoperative radiation (n = 67) vs. postoperative radiation (n = 15) vs. no radiation (n = 45) (P = 0.02); local excision (n = 10) vs. low anterior resection (n = 55) vs. coloanal anastomosis (n = 62) (P = 0.002); and handsewn (n = 18) vs. stapled anastomosis (n = 99) (P = 0.006). The total score correlated with 4 of 4 Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life (P < 0.01) and 9 of 17 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer subscales (all P < 0.01). Patients undergoing sphincter-preserving surgery for rectal cancer have impaired bowel function, and those treated with radiation, coloanal anastomoses, or handsewn anastomoses have significantly worse function.

We used 3 cohorts of men who were evaluated with sextant biopsy of the prostate and whose presenting prostate specific antigen (PSA) was not greater than 50 ng/ml. Data from 4,193 men from Montreal, Canada were used to develop a nomogram based on age, digital rectal examination (DRE) and serum PSA. External validation was performed on 1,762 men from Hamburg, Germany. Data from these men were subsequently used to develop a second nomogram in which percent free PSA (%fPSA) was added as a predictor. External validation was performed using 514 men from Montreal. Both nomograms were based on multivariate logistic regression models. Predictive accuracy was evaluated with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve and graphically with loess smoothing plots. PCa was detected in 1,477 (35.2%) men from Montreal, 739 (41.9%) men from Hamburg and 189 (36.8%) men from Montreal. In all models all predictors were significant at 0.05.

Clinical examination following preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer is not a reliable surrogate end point.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2005-05-01,"Clinical assessment of rectal cancer response to preoperative combined-modality therapy (CMT) using digital rectal examination (DRE) has been proposed as a means of assessing efficacy of therapy. However, because the accuracy of this approach has not been established, we conducted a prospective analysis to determine the operating surgeon's ability to assess response using DRE. Ninety-four prospectively accrued patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (T3/4 or N1) were evaluated with DRE and sigmoidoscopy in order to determine the following tumor characteristics: size, location, mobility, morphology, and circumference. Following preoperative CMT (50.40 Gy with fluorouracil-based chemotherapy) and under general anesthesia, the same surgeon estimated tumor response based on changes in these tumor characteristics, assessed via DRE. Percent pathologic tumor response was determined prospectively by a single pathologist using whole mount sections of the resected cancer. Clinical assessment using DRE underestimated pathologic response in 73 cases (78%). In addition, DRE was able to identify only 3 of 14 cases (21%) with a pathologic complete response.

Complications after preoperative combined modality therapy and radical resection of locally advanced rectal cancer: a 14-year experience from a specialty service.,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,J. Am. Coll. Surg.,2005-06-01,"Preoperative combined modality therapy followed by total mesorectal excision has emerged as the optimal treatment paradigm for locally advanced rectal cancer (T3 to 4, N1, or both). But its impact on postoperative complications has not been adequately evaluated. Our aims were to evaluate our comprehensive experience and identify factors predictive of complications in this patient population. The study group consisted of 297 consecutive patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma treated with preoperative combined modality therapy (radiation: 5,040 cGy; chemotherapy: 5-FU-based) and then operation. Major complications were defined as those requiring medical or surgical treatment. A prospectively collected database was queried to determine the incidence of postoperative complications and associated clinicopathologic factors. Median followup was 43.9 months (range 0.8 to 128.6 months). There were no postoperative mortalities (within 30 days of operation). But there were 145 major complications in 98 patients (33% of study population). The most common complications were small bowel obstruction (n = 32 [11%]) and wound infection (n = 31 [10%]). There were eight anastomotic leaks (4%) and nine pelvic abscesses (4%) in patients treated with low anterior resection (n = 210). Preoperative comorbidity was the only clinicopathologic factor associated with postoperative complications (p = 0.02). Postoperative complications had no significant impact on oncologic outcomes. Although postoperative mortalities are rare, complications requiring treatment can be anticipated in one-third of patients undergoing preoperative combined modality therapy and total mesorectal excision. A policy of selective fecal diversion after preoperative combined modality therapy and total mesorectal excision for locally advanced rectal cancer can achieve low rates of pelvic sepsis, but may lead to an increased incidence of small bowel obstruction.",Journal Article,5347.0,58.0,"Preoperative combined modality therapy followed by total mesorectal excision has emerged as the optimal treatment paradigm for locally advanced cancer T3 to 4 N1 or both But its impact on postoperative complications has not been adequately evaluated Our aims were to evaluate our comprehensive experience and identify factors predictive of complications in this patient population The study group consisted of 297 consecutive patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma treated with preoperative combined modality therapy radiation 5,040 cGy chemotherapy 5-FU-based and then operation Major complications were defined as those requiring medical or surgical treatment A prospectively collected database was queried to determine the incidence of postoperative complications and associated clinicopathologic factors Median followup was 43.9 months range 0.8 to 128.6 months There were no postoperative mortalities within 30 days of operation But there were 145 major complications in 98 patients 33 of study population The most common complications were small bowel obstruction n 32 11 and wound infection n 31 10 There were eight anastomotic leaks 4 and nine pelvic abscesses 4 in patients treated with low anterior resection n 210 Preoperative comorbidity was the only clinicopathologic factor associated with postoperative complications p 0.02 Postoperative complications had no significant impact on oncologic outcomes Although postoperative mortalities are rare complications requiring treatment can be anticipated in one-third of patients undergoing preoperative combined modality therapy and total mesorectal excision A policy of selective fecal diversion after preoperative combined modality therapy and total mesorectal excision for locally advanced cancer can achieve low rates of pelvic sepsis but may lead to an increased incidence of small bowel obstruction",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[498, 397, 1396, 36, 370, 20, 181, 5823, 1366, 71, 2054, 22, 3, 665, 24, 2431, 9, 795, 131, 12, 2065, 6, 39, 3192, 15, 110, 84, 211, 345, 23, 573, 521, 71, 44, 85, 4215, 194, 114, 2970, 11, 6, 376, 114, 949, 730, 2, 255, 130, 464, 1, 521, 4, 26, 69, 266, 3, 45, 87, 1695, 1, 8526, 935, 7, 5, 795, 131, 449, 73, 5, 498, 397, 1396, 36, 121, 33, 6824, 3071, 56, 33, 1296, 90, 2, 818, 2589, 458, 521, 11, 395, 22, 135, 1888, 484, 15, 221, 24, 8, 1143, 786, 609, 10, 3547, 6, 223, 3, 287, 1, 573, 521, 2, 41, 1399, 130, 52, 3569, 10, 601, 83, 53, 184, 13, 66, 6, 3990, 49, 53, 125, 11, 77, 573, 9743, 262, 201, 162, 1, 2589, 84, 125, 11, 4058, 458, 521, 4, 1096, 7, 466, 1, 45, 266, 3, 96, 186, 521, 11, 302, 1659, 3191, 78, 531, 175, 2, 2689, 930, 78, 456, 79, 125, 11, 659, 4818, 9674, 39, 2, 762, 1110, 17270, 39, 4, 7, 73, 5, 154, 2882, 170, 78, 5376, 498, 1879, 10, 3, 158, 1399, 161, 41, 5, 573, 521, 19, 13, 588, 573, 521, 42, 77, 93, 345, 23, 1998, 123, 242, 573, 9743, 32, 622, 521, 1888, 24, 122, 40, 4078, 4, 104, 1282, 1, 7, 479, 498, 397, 1396, 36, 2, 181, 5823, 1366, 8, 4196, 1, 1094, 6784, 6067, 50, 498, 397, 1396, 36, 2, 181, 5823, 1366, 9, 795, 131, 12, 122, 1359, 154, 151, 1, 1110, 4227, 84, 68, 1122, 6, 35, 101, 287, 1, 302, 1659, 3191]",1869.0,15922198,263
Prostate cancer: correlation of MR imaging and MR spectroscopy with pathologic findings after radiation therapy-initial experience.,Radiology,Radiology,2005-06-21,"To prospectively evaluate magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR spectroscopy for depiction of local prostate cancer recurrence after external-beam radiation therapy, with step-section pathologic findings as the standard of reference. Study received institutional approval, and written informed consent was obtained. Study was compliant with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Sextant biopsy, digital rectal examination, MR imaging, MR spectroscopy, and salvage radical prostatectomy with step-section pathologic examination were performed in nine patients with increasing prostate-specific antigen levels after external-beam radiation therapy. MR imaging criterion for tumor was a focal nodular region of reduced signal intensity at T2-weighted imaging. MR spectroscopic criteria for tumor were voxels with choline (Cho) plus creatine (Cr) to citrate (Cit) ratio ([Cho + Cr]/Cit) of at least 0.5 or voxels with detectable Cho and no Cit in the peripheral zone. Sensitivity and specificity of sextant biopsy, digital rectal examination, MR imaging, and MR spectroscopy were determined by using a prostate sextant as the unit of analysis. For feature analysis, MR imaging and MR spectroscopic findings were correlated with step-section pathologic findings. MR imaging and MR spectroscopy showed estimated sensitivities of 68% and 77%, respectively, while sensitivities of biopsy and digital rectal examination were 48% and 16%, respectively. MR spectroscopy appears to be less specific (78%) than the other three tests, each of which had a specificity higher than 90%. MR spectroscopic feature analysis showed that a metabolically altered benign gland could be falsely identified as tumor by using MR spectroscopic criteria; further analysis of MR spectroscopic features did not lead to improved MR spectroscopic criteria for recurrent tumor. In summary, MR imaging and MR spectroscopy may be more sensitive than sextant biopsy and digital rectal examination for sextant localization of cancer recurrence after external-beam radiation therapy.",Comparative Study,5327.0,171.0,To prospectively evaluate magnetic resonance MR imaging and MR spectroscopy for depiction of local cancer recurrence after external-beam radiation therapy with step-section pathologic findings as the standard of reference Study received institutional approval and written informed consent was obtained Study was compliant with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Sextant biopsy digital examination MR imaging MR spectroscopy and salvage radical prostatectomy with step-section pathologic examination were performed in nine patients with increasing prostate-specific antigen levels after external-beam radiation therapy MR imaging criterion for tumor was a focal nodular region of reduced signal intensity at T2-weighted imaging MR spectroscopic criteria for tumor were voxels with choline Cho plus creatine Cr to citrate Cit ratio Cho Cr /Cit of at least 0.5 or voxels with detectable Cho and no Cit in the peripheral zone Sensitivity and specificity of sextant biopsy digital examination MR imaging and MR spectroscopy were determined by using a sextant as the unit of analysis For feature analysis MR imaging and MR spectroscopic findings were correlated with step-section pathologic findings MR imaging and MR spectroscopy showed estimated sensitivities of 68 and 77 respectively while sensitivities of biopsy and digital examination were 48 and 16 respectively MR spectroscopy appears to be less specific 78 than the other three tests each of which had a specificity higher than 90 MR spectroscopic feature analysis showed that a metabolically altered benign gland could be falsely identified as tumor by using MR spectroscopic criteria further analysis of MR spectroscopic features did not lead to improved MR spectroscopic criteria for recurrent tumor In summary MR imaging and MR spectroscopy may be more sensitive than sextant biopsy and digital examination for sextant localization of cancer recurrence after external-beam radiation therapy,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[6, 1143, 376, 1484, 1535, 1638, 270, 2, 1638, 5326, 9, 20182, 1, 293, 12, 146, 50, 1455, 1345, 121, 36, 5, 2458, 2917, 510, 272, 22, 3, 260, 1, 2482, 45, 103, 1115, 1814, 2, 6538, 2767, 3844, 10, 683, 45, 10, 6982, 5, 341, 1935, 16400, 2, 13625, 2559, 11256, 411, 3271, 1385, 1638, 270, 1638, 5326, 2, 992, 711, 1202, 5, 2458, 2917, 510, 1385, 11, 173, 4, 762, 7, 5, 602, 1364, 112, 448, 148, 50, 1455, 1345, 121, 36, 1638, 270, 4643, 9, 30, 10, 8, 2137, 4481, 1053, 1, 405, 1235, 837, 28, 1786, 2337, 270, 1638, 7664, 371, 9, 30, 11, 8784, 5, 7884, 9024, 349, 10593, 684, 6, 13274, 9192, 197, 9024, 684, 9192, 1, 28, 506, 13, 33, 15, 8784, 5, 2083, 9024, 2, 77, 9192, 4, 3, 672, 3614, 485, 2, 1121, 1, 11256, 411, 3271, 1385, 1638, 270, 2, 1638, 5326, 11, 509, 20, 75, 8, 11256, 22, 3, 2712, 1, 65, 9, 2705, 65, 1638, 270, 2, 1638, 7664, 272, 11, 438, 5, 2458, 2917, 510, 272, 1638, 270, 2, 1638, 5326, 224, 661, 6202, 1, 806, 2, 849, 106, 369, 6202, 1, 411, 2, 3271, 1385, 11, 576, 2, 245, 106, 1638, 5326, 1233, 6, 40, 299, 112, 833, 76, 3, 127, 169, 895, 296, 1, 92, 42, 8, 1121, 142, 76, 424, 1638, 7664, 2705, 65, 224, 17, 8, 10392, 1495, 1002, 2326, 359, 40, 16683, 108, 22, 30, 20, 75, 1638, 7664, 371, 195, 65, 1, 1638, 7664, 404, 205, 44, 1122, 6, 231, 1638, 7664, 371, 9, 387, 30, 4, 1962, 1638, 270, 2, 1638, 5326, 68, 40, 80, 745, 76, 11256, 411, 2, 3271, 1385, 9, 11256, 2145, 1, 12, 146, 50, 1455, 1345, 121, 36]",1965.0,15972335,83
Association of statin use with a pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2005-08-01,"To assess whether 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, might enhance the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoradiation in rectal cancer. Between 1996 and 2001, 358 patients with clinically resectable, nonmetastatic rectal cancer underwent surgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center after neoadjuvant chemoradiation for either locally advanced tumors or low-lying tumors that would require abdominoperineal resection. We excluded 9 patients for radiation therapy dose <45 Gy or if statin use was unknown, leaving 349 evaluable patients. Median radiation therapy dose was 50.4 Gy (range, 45-55.8 Gy), and 308 patients (88%) received 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. Medication use, comorbid illnesses, clinical stage as assessed by digital rectal examination and ultrasound, and type of chemotherapy were analyzed for associations with pathologic complete response (pCR), defined as no microscopic evidence of tumor. Fisher's exact test was used for categoric variables, Mantel-Haenszel test for ordered categoric variables, and logistic regression for multivariate analysis. Thirty-three patients (9%) used a statin, with no differences in clinical stage according to digital rectal examination or ultrasound compared with the other 324 patients. At the time of surgery, 23 nonstatin patients (7%) were found to have metastatic disease, compared with 0% for statin patients. The unadjusted pCR rates with and without statin use were 30% and 17%, respectively (p = 0.10). Variables significant univariately at the p = 0.15 level were entered into a multivariate model, as were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which were strongly associated with statin use. The odds ratio for statin use on pCR was 4.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.7-12.1; p = 0.003) after adjusting for NSAID use, clinical stage, and type of chemotherapy. In multivariate analysis, statin use is associated with an improved pCR rate after neoadjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer. The low prevalence of statin use limits the power to detect a significant difference at a type I error threshold of p = 0.05 in this analysis. Although no definitive conclusions can be drawn on the basis of this retrospective study, the unusually high incidence of pCR after chemoradiation suggests that the use of statins in the treatment of rectal cancer warrants further evaluation.",Journal Article,5286.0,65.0,To assess whether 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or statins might enhance the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoradiation in cancer Between 1996 and 2001 358 patients with clinically resectable nonmetastatic cancer underwent surgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center after neoadjuvant chemoradiation for either locally advanced tumors or low-lying tumors that would require abdominoperineal resection We excluded 9 patients for radiation therapy dose 45 Gy or if statin use was unknown leaving 349 evaluable patients Median radiation therapy dose was 50.4 Gy range 45-55.8 Gy and 308 patients 88 received 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy Medication use comorbid illnesses clinical stage as assessed by digital examination and ultrasound and type of chemotherapy were analyzed for associations with pathologic complete response pCR defined as no microscopic evidence of tumor Fisher 's exact test was used for categoric variables Mantel-Haenszel test for ordered categoric variables and logistic regression for multivariate analysis Thirty-three patients 9 used a statin with no differences in clinical stage according to digital examination or ultrasound compared with the other 324 patients At the time of surgery 23 nonstatin patients 7 were found to have metastatic disease compared with 0 for statin patients The unadjusted pCR rates with and without statin use were 30 and 17 respectively p 0.10 Variables significant univariately at the p 0.15 level were entered into a multivariate model as were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs which were strongly associated with statin use The odds ratio for statin use on pCR was 4.2 95 confidence interval 1.7-12.1 p 0.003 after adjusting for NSAID use clinical stage and type of chemotherapy In multivariate analysis statin use is associated with an improved pCR rate after neoadjuvant chemoradiation for cancer The low prevalence of statin use limits the power to detect a significant difference at a type I error threshold of p 0.05 in this analysis Although no definitive conclusions can be drawn on the basis of this retrospective study the unusually high incidence of pCR after chemoradiation suggests that the use of statins in the treatment of cancer warrants further evaluation,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[6, 423, 317, 27, 10175, 27, 18418, 14411, 8, 4027, 222, 15, 5241, 822, 1304, 3, 209, 1, 536, 975, 4, 12, 59, 2648, 2, 1758, 8396, 7, 5, 505, 1899, 2683, 12, 208, 152, 28, 2563, 2783, 2784, 12, 574, 50, 536, 975, 9, 361, 795, 131, 57, 15, 154, 18170, 57, 17, 688, 1353, 8177, 170, 21, 1800, 83, 7, 9, 121, 36, 61, 512, 381, 15, 492, 4295, 119, 10, 860, 7806, 9043, 859, 7, 52, 121, 36, 61, 10, 212, 39, 381, 184, 512, 614, 66, 381, 2, 7786, 7, 889, 103, 33, 1404, 90, 56, 3012, 119, 3952, 8837, 38, 82, 22, 275, 20, 3271, 1385, 2, 1945, 2, 267, 1, 56, 11, 311, 9, 685, 5, 510, 236, 51, 604, 395, 22, 77, 2984, 241, 1, 30, 3135, 292, 2472, 412, 10, 95, 9, 19511, 682, 11618, 14496, 412, 9, 7591, 19511, 682, 2, 812, 320, 9, 331, 65, 977, 169, 7, 83, 95, 8, 4295, 5, 77, 362, 4, 38, 82, 768, 6, 3271, 1385, 15, 1945, 72, 5, 3, 127, 8393, 7, 28, 3, 98, 1, 152, 382, 37981, 7, 67, 11, 204, 6, 47, 113, 34, 72, 5, 13, 9, 4295, 7, 3, 4487, 604, 151, 5, 2, 187, 4295, 119, 11, 201, 2, 269, 106, 19, 13, 79, 682, 93, 16787, 28, 3, 19, 13, 167, 301, 11, 2836, 237, 8, 331, 202, 22, 11, 4960, 312, 1291, 600, 5225, 92, 11, 1327, 41, 5, 4295, 119, 3, 610, 197, 9, 4295, 119, 23, 604, 10, 39, 18, 48, 307, 268, 14, 67, 133, 14, 19, 13, 1421, 50, 1358, 9, 6732, 119, 38, 82, 2, 267, 1, 56, 4, 331, 65, 4295, 119, 16, 41, 5, 35, 231, 604, 116, 50, 536, 975, 9, 12, 3, 154, 1078, 1, 4295, 119, 3526, 3, 2349, 6, 1426, 8, 93, 523, 28, 8, 267, 70, 3444, 2390, 1, 19, 13, 474, 4, 26, 65, 242, 77, 1057, 2130, 122, 40, 5694, 23, 3, 877, 1, 26, 459, 45, 3, 15499, 64, 287, 1, 604, 50, 975, 844, 17, 3, 119, 1, 5241, 4, 3, 24, 1, 12, 2782, 195, 451]",2274.0,16029794,184
Distal cT2N0 rectal cancer: is there an alternative to abdominoperineal resection?,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2005-08-01,"Patients with cT2N0 distal rectal cancer do not require adjuvant therapy. However, when a patient refuses an abdominoperineal resection (APR), is there an alternative? The purpose of this trial is to determine whether preoperative external-beam radiation therapy can increase the rate of sphincter preservation for patients with distal cT2N0 adenocarcinoma of the rectum. Between April 1988 and October 2003, 27 patients with distal rectal adenocarcinoma staged T2 by clinical and/or endorectal ultrasound who were judged by the operating surgeon to require an APR were treated with preoperative pelvic radiation alone (50.4 Gy). Surgery was performed 4 to 7 weeks later. If pathologic positive pelvic nodes were identified, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was recommended. The median follow-up was 55 months (range, 9 to 140 months). The pathologic complete response rate was 15% and 78% of patients underwent a sphincter-sparing procedure. The crude incidence of local failure for patients undergoing a sphincter sparing procedure was 10% and the 5-year actuarial incidence was 13%. The actuarial 5-year survival for patients undergoing sphincter preservation was as follows: disease-free, 77%; colostomy-free, 100%; and overall, 85%. Using the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center sphincter function score, 54% of those undergoing a sphincter-sparing procedure had good/excellent bowel function at 12 to 24 months after surgery, and 77% had good/excellent function at 24 to 36 months after surgery.

Clinical outcomes of androgen deprivation as the sole therapy for localized and locally advanced prostate cancer.,BJU international,BJU Int.,2005-09-01,"To characterize the clinical outcomes of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as the sole therapy for localized prostate cancer, and to determine independent predictors of disease progression, as recent studies indicate an increasing use of ADT. The records of all patients with cT1-4NXM0 adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with ADT as the primary initial therapy at the Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center between 1993 and 2000 were reviewed. Age, race, Charlson Health Index, family history, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, PSA density, digital rectal examination (DRE) findings, Gleason score, and percentage of positive biopsy cores at diagnosis were recorded for 81 patients. Patients had a median (SD, range) age of 73 (5.6, 58-84) years, a PSA level of 14.3 (34.6, 1.4-252) ng/mL and tumours were classified as Gleason score < or = 5 in 9% of patients, 6 in 31%, 7 in 31% and 8-10 in 30%. Outcomes extracted were PSA progression, PSA nadir, bone fractures, local progression, distant progression and overall survival. With a median (range) follow-up of 54 (6-115) months, the incidence of local progression, distant progression, bone fractures, PSA progression, and death were 10%, 7%, 25%, 21% and 41% respectively.

Recursive partitioning for risk stratification in men undergoing repeat prostate biopsies.,Cancer,Cancer,2005-11-01,"The current study was performed to identify risk factors and risk groups for carcinoma detection in men undergoing repeat prostate biopsies. The medical records of all men who had a negative initial prostate biopsy and underwent at least one repeat biopsy between 1992 and 2003 were reviewed to extract age, race, family history of prostate carcinoma, body mass index, referral indication, all prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values, digital rectal examination, PSA density (PSAD), the presence of a hypoechoic lesion, and the presence of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) on initial biopsy. Risk factors for a subsequent diagnosis of prostate carcinoma were identified using the log-rank test and a stepwise, stratified Cox regression model. Based on the risk factors identified by Cox regression analysis, recursive partitioning was further used for risk stratification. A total of 373 patients underwent 975 biopsy procedures. During a median follow-up of 37.0 months, prostate carcinoma was detected in 107 of 373 patients (28.9%). Independent predictors of a positive biopsy (P < 0.05) were PSA doubling time (PSADT), PSAD, referral indication, the presence of HGPIN, patient age, and family history of prostate carcinoma.

Morbidity of rectosigmoid resection and primary anastomosis in patients undergoing primary cytoreductive surgery for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2005-09-08,"Studies from the colorectal literature have shown that factors associated with anastomotic leak after colorectal resection include long surgical time (>2 h), multiple blood transfusions, and short distance to the anal verge. The aim of this study was to assess the morbidity associated with en bloc resection of ovarian carcinoma with low anterior resection and anastomosis in patients undergoing primary cytoreductive surgery for advanced disease. We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients who had undergone primary cytoreduction for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer with rectosigmoid resection followed by low rectal anastomosis between January 1994 and June 2004. Patient characteristics, operative details, and postoperative complications were extracted from patients' charts. Seventy patients met the above criteria and form our study group. The median age was 59 years (range, 25-82). There were 52 stage IIIC (74%) and 18 stage IV (26%) cancers. The median operating time was 315 min (range, 120-750) and the median estimated blood loss was 1200 ml (range, 250-8000), with 53 (76%) patients requiring blood transfusion. Twenty-eight patients (40%) underwent major upper abdominal procedures other than omentectomy, and 14 patients (20%) underwent a second bowel resection. Twelve patients (17%) underwent a protective ileostomy while the remainder (83%) did not. Of the 58 patients with no ostomy, the only complications associated with the resection and anastomoses were a pelvic abscess in 3 patients (5%) and an anastomotic leak requiring diverting colostomy in 1 patient (1.7%). Of the 12 patients who had protective ileostomies, 3 (25%) had complications related to their ileostomy short-bowel syndrome requiring early reversal, incarceration of the prolapsed loop requiring surgical correction, and prolapse corrected electively at the time of second-look surgery. In women undergoing primary cytoreductive surgery, the morbidity associated with en bloc resection of ovarian carcinoma with low rectosigmoid resection and anastomosis without protective ileostomy was acceptably low, with an anastomotic leak rate of less than 2%.

Conservative management of pneumatosis intestinalis.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2005-09-19,"Pneumatosis intestinalis is a rare condition characterized by subserosal and submucosal gas-filled cysts in the gastrointestinal tract; it may be associated with bowel ischemia, perforation, and a high mortality rate. As a result, many authorities advocate an aggressive surgical approach in patients with pneumatosis intestinalis. A 53-year-old female with recurrent, metastatic uterine leiomyosarcoma underwent resection of the pelvic recurrence, low anterior rectal resection with primary anastomosis, and partial hepatectomy for liver metastasis. Her postoperative course was notable for a small bowel obstruction and the finding of pneumatosis intestinalis on radiologic studies. The patient developed mild abdominal pain. She did not develop tenderness or fevers. She was managed with bowel rest, nasogastric tube decompression, total parenteral nutrition, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The finding of pneumatosis intestinalis resolved over the ensuing 6 days. Her diet was slowly advanced, and she was discharged home in stable condition without further surgical intervention or recurrence of the obstruction or pneumatosis. Currently, her only evidence of disease is pulmonary metastases. In select patients, the outcome of a conservative approach to the management of pneumatosis intestinalis is not much different than surgical re-exploration for highly selected patients.

T1 adenocarcinoma of the rectum: transanal excision or radical surgery?,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2005-10-01,"Recent studies suggest local excision may be acceptable treatment of T1 adenocarcinoma of the rectum, but there is little comparative data with radical surgery to assess outcomes and quantify risk. We performed a retrospective evaluation of patients with T1 rectal cancers treated by either transanal excision or radical resection at our institution to assess patient selection, cancer recurrence, and survival. All patients who underwent surgery for T1 adenocarcinomas of the rectum (0-15 cm from anal verge) by either transanal excision (TAE) or radical resection (RAD) between January 1987 and January 2004 were identified from a prospective database. Data were analyzed using Fisher exact test, Kaplan-Meier method, and log-rank test. Three hundred nineteen consecutive patients with T1 lesions were treated by transanal excision (n = 151) or radical surgery (n = 168) over the 17-year period. RAD surgery was associated with higher tumor location in the rectum, slightly larger tumor size, a similar rate of adverse histology, and a lymph node metastasis rate of 18%. Despite these features, patients who underwent RAD surgery had fewer local recurrences, fewer distant recurrences, and significantly better recurrence-free survival (P = 0.0001). Overall and disease-specific survival was similar for RAD and TAE groups. Despite a similar risk profile in the 2 surgical groups, patients with T1 rectal cancer treated by local excision were observed to have a 3- to 5-fold higher risk of tumor recurrence compared with patients treated by radical surgery.

Mesorectal lymph node involvement and prognostic implications at total pelvic exenteration for gynecologic malignancies.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2005-10-14,"To determine the incidence and prognostic implications of positive mesorectal lymph nodes in patients undergoing total pelvic exenteration for recurrent gynecologic malignancies. We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients who had undergone total pelvic exenteration for a gynecologic malignancy between July 1992 and December 2003. Patient charts were reviewed for information regarding demographics, site of cancer, histology, pathology report, and time to recurrence. Fifty-eight women had undergone total pelvic exenteration for recurrent gynecologic malignancies during the study period and 57 were available for analysis. Primary cancer site was as follows: cervix, 37 (65%); vagina, 8 (14%); vulva, 5 (9%); and uterine corpus, 7 (12%). In 30 patients (53%), the mesorectal lymph node status was pathologically evaluated. Of these 30 patients, 3 (10%) had positive mesorectal lymph nodes at the time of total pelvic exenteration. All 3 patients had rectal wall involvement (rectal submucosa, 2; rectal mucosa, 1), and all 3 patients recurred within 4 months of pelvic exenteration. The median time to recurrence after surgery was 2.4 months in those patients with positive mesorectal lymph nodes compared with 7.3 months in those with negative mesorectal lymph nodes (P = 0.005). When individually adjusted for other prognostic variables, such as margin status, tumor grade, lymphovascular space involvement, primary cancer site, and histologic type, a finding of positive mesorectal lymph nodes was associated with a shorter time to recurrence of disease (all P < 0.05).

Sphincter preservation therapy for rectal cancer.,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,2003-12-01,"Rectal cancer presents a unique challenge to oncologists and patients due to the location and anatomy of the rectum and the difficulties inherent in pre-operative staging. These issues are especially important with distal rectal tumors when patients may face the decision of tumor control without sphincter preservation or more limited surgical procedures that may potentially compromise tumor control and thus survival. Current options for sphincter preservation for low-lying rectal tumors are preoperative radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy for tumor downstaging, local excision with or without adjuvant chemoradiation and low anterior resection with coloanal anastomosis. Pretreatment evaluation, by radiologic studies and pathologic predictors of lymph node involvement, is an integral part of determining which patients are suitable candidates for treatment with local excision. Preoperative chemoradiotherapy is a treatment option for some patients who are not initially considered to be candidates for sphincter preservation. Many investigators have suggested that the rate of sphincter preservation in patients with rectal cancer may be improved following preoperative chemotherapy and radiation.

Presence of distal intramural spread after preoperative combined-modality therapy for adenocarcinoma of the rectum: what is now the appropriate distal resection margin?,Surgery,Surgery,2005-10-01,"Preoperative combined-modality therapy (CMT) is considered the treatment approach of choice for rectal cancer. To examine the effect of CMT on distal intramural spread (DIS), we determined the extent of DIS in rectal cancer specimens after CMT. Specimens from 20 patients after preoperative CMT and total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer were analyzed for extent of DIS. Specimens were washed, fixed in formalin, and sectioned in 5-mm cuts from the distal border of the residual tumor to the distal resection margin. Eleven patients (55%) had DIS. Two patients had a complete pathologic response (10%). The mean extent of DIS was 0.50 cm (standard deviation, 0.64 cm; range, 0.0 to 2.5 cm). Only 1 patient in the study had DIS beyond 1 cm from the residual tumor. Six of the patients have died at a median of 30.4 months after operation (range, 19.0 to 51.1 months).

"Comparison of endorectal magnetic resonance imaging, guided prostate biopsy and digital rectal examination in the preoperative anatomical localization of prostate cancer.",The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2005-12-01,"We compared the accuracy of endorectal magnetic resonance imaging (erMRI), transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy and digital rectal examination (DRE) for detecting the location of cancer in the prostate gland and seminal vesicles. This is a retrospective study of 106 consecutive patients with prostate cancer who were referred for erMRI before radical prostatectomy. Step-section pathological data and erMRI were available in 90 patients, DRE data were available on 86 and individually labeled sextant core biopsies were available in 45. T1 and T2-weighted erMRI was interpreted by a single reader, who scored the likelihood of tumor on a 5-point scale in each seminal vesicle and in 12 locations in the prostate gland. MR spectroscopy data were not used for erMRI interpretation. One pathologist reviewed whole mount serial sections of radical prostatectomy specimens. The area under ROC curves was used to evaluate accuracy. The area under ROC curves for tumor localization was higher for erMRI than for DRE at the prostatic apex (0.72 vs 0.66), mid gland (0.80 vs 0.69) and base (0.83 vs 0.69). It was likewise higher for erMRI than for TRUS biopsy in the mid gland (0.75 vs 0.68) and base (0.81 vs 0.61) but not in the apex (0.67 vs 0.70). On mixed model analysis erMRI significantly increased the accuracy of prostate cancer localization by DRE or TRUS biopsy (each p <0.0001).

Genomic profiling associated with recurrence in patients with rectal cancer treated with chemoradiation.,Pharmacogenomics,Pharmacogenomics,2006-01-01,"Stage II and III adenocarcinoma of the rectum has an overall 5-year survival rate of approximately 50%, and tumor recurrence remains a major problem despite an improvement in local control through chemotherapy and radiation. The efficacy of chemoradiation therapy may be significantly compromised as a result of interindividual variations in clinical response and host toxicity. Therefore, it is imperative to identify those patients who will benefit from chemoradiation therapy and those who will develop recurrent disease. In this study, we tested whether a specific pattern of 21 polymorphisms in 18 genes involved in the critical pathways of cancer progression (i.e., drug metabolism, tumor microenvironment, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair) will predict the risk of tumor recurrence in rectal cancer patients treated with chemoradiation. A total of 90 patients with Stage II or III rectal cancer treated with chemoradiation were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques for 21 polymorphisms.

Thirty-two consecutive patients scheduled for TEM were identified from our prospectively maintained colorectal service database. Clinicopathologic factors, postoperative complications, and oncologic outcomes were analyzed for all patients. In addition, a PubMed literature search was performed with use of the key words ""transanal endoscopic microsurgery,"" ""TEM,"" ""rectal tumor,"" and ""rectal cancer."" Transanal endoscopic microsurgery was performed for rectal adenocarcinoma (n = 17; 53%), adenoma (n = 12; 38%), and carcinoid tumors (n = 3; 9%). Median tumor location was 9 cm from the anal verge (range, 3-15 cm). Of the 32 attempted TEM procedures, 27 (84%) were completed. Reasons for inability to complete TEM included narrow rectal lumen or contour of bony pelvis prohibiting passage of the operating proctoscope into the upper rectum and inability to maintain the proctoscope in the rectal lumen with carbon dioxide insufflation because of the distal location of the tumor. Innovations used in the excision of rectal tumors via TEM included the use of the harmonic scalpel, closure of the rectal defect with an extracorporeal slip knot, and a hybrid approach incorporating TEM and traditional transanal techniques.

In this study the authors examined functional outcome following sacrectomy. The authors reviewed the charts of 50 consecutive patients who had undergone sacrectomy between July 1993 and August 2002. There were 23 male and 27 female patients whose mean age was 46 years (range 13-86 years). Twelve patients with rectal cancer underwent a separate analysis. The patients without rectal cancer were divided into two groups: those who had undergone colostomy for bowel diversion (Group 1, six cases), and those who had not (Group 2, 32 cases). In Group 1 patients the median hospital length of stay (LOS) was 48.5 days (the 25th% and 75th percentiles are 26 and 58, respectively), and in Group 2 patients the median LOS was 18.5 days (the 25th and 75th percentiles are 8 and 41, respectively; p = 0.14). In Group 2 (non-rectal cancer without colostomy), LOS was greater in patients in whom a myocutaneous flap was used compared with those in whom no flap was used (36 days compared with 8.5 days, respectively; p = 0.0012); in patients with bowel incontinence the median LOS was significantly longer than that in patients with bowel continence (39 days compared with 8 days, respectively; p = 0.0026).

Outcome after curative resection for locally recurrent rectal cancer.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2006-02-01,"Few biologic markers have been studied as prognostic factors in recurrent rectal carcinoma patients. We sought to determine the influence of clinical, pathologic, and biologic (p53, bcl-2, and ki-67) variables on survival after curative resection of locally recurrent rectal cancer. Retrospective review of patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer who received surgery with curative intent. From 1988 to 1998, 134 patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer underwent operative exploration. Curative resection was performed in 85 patients. Median follow-up was 43 (range, 1.3-149) months. On multivariate analysis, negative predictors of overall survival included an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen level (P=0.02; hazard ratio 2.41; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.19-4.89) and an R1 resection margin (P = 0.01; hazard ratio, 2.81; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.27-6.21). In 26 patients for whom biologic variables were available, p53, bcl-2, and ki-67 did not significantly impact disease-specific survival or overall survival. Five-year disease-specific survival, overall survival, and pelvic control rates were 46, 36, and 51 percent respectively. Of the 50 patients who relapsed, time to second local recurrence was longer than time to development of metastasis (median, 16.5 vs. 9 months).

"Impact of age, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and cancer on prostate-specific antigen level.",Cancer,Cancer,2006-04-01,"The distribution of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values for men with or without prostate carcinoma are confounded because of verification bias. Correcting for verification bias, the means and variances of PSA values were estimated in specific clinical scenarios. Existing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, adjusted for the presence of verification bias in a screening population, were used to estimate the mean and variance of PSA values for men with or without prostate carcinoma, stratified by age and the presence or absence of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Men with a suspicious digital rectal exam (nodular) were excluded from analysis. Among men with cancer and the absence of benign prostatic hyperplasia, mean PSA values were 2.05 ng/mL and 2.66 ng/mL for younger (<60 yr) and older (> or =60 yrs) men, respectively. These estimates were 2.56 ng/mL and 3.90 ng/mL in the presence of benign prostatic hyperplasia for younger and older men, respectively. For men without prostate carcinoma, these values were 0.78 ng/mL and 1.23 ng/mL for younger and older men, respectively, among those without benign prostatic hyperplasia, and 0.97 ng/mL and 1.75 ng/mL for younger and older men, respectively, among those with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Differential CD146 expression on circulating versus tissue endothelial cells in rectal cancer patients: implications for circulating endothelial and progenitor cells as biomarkers for antiangiogenic therapy.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2006-03-01,"Circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and progenitor cells are currently evaluated as potential biomarkers of antiangiogenic therapy. CD146 is considered a panendothelial-specific marker, but its utility as a CEC marker in cancer patients remains unclear. We analyzed the expression of CD146 on mononuclear blood cells, primary tissue endothelial cells, and malignant and normal tissues by flow cytometric and immunohistochemical analyses. Furthermore, we measured the circulation kinetics of CD146+ cells before, and then 3 and 12 days after vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody blockade by bevacizumab infusion in rectal cancer patients enrolled in a phase I trial. In the peripheral blood of these cancer patients, over 90% of the CD146+ cells were CD45+ hematopoietic cells. CD146 expression was primarily detected on a subset of CD3+CD4+ lymphocytes, and was undetectable on CD34+CD133+CD45(dim) progenitor cells or CD31(bright)CD45- viable CECs. In contradistinction, CD146 was detectable in tissues on both cellular components of tumor vessel wall: CD31(bright)CD45- endothelial cells and alpha-SMA+ pericytes. Unlike viable CECs and progenitor cells, CD146+ cell concentration in the peripheral blood of cancer patients did not decrease during VEGF blockade. CD146 is fairly homogeneously expressed on vascular endothelium but not on viable CECs or progenitor cells. The vast majority of CD146+ blood cells are lymphocytes, and VEGF blockade by bevacizumab did not significantly change their number in rectal cancer patients.

Colon Rectum,2006-05-01,"This study was designed to review the clinical characteristics of surgically treated gastrointestinal stromal tumors of the colon and rectum, evaluate their immunohistochemical and pathologic features based on the current National Institutes of Health criteria, and correlate clinicopathologic findings with the subsequent clinical course. Patient and disease characteristics at presentation, pathologic features, surgical management, and clinical outcomes of 18 patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (4 colon and 14 rectum) diagnosed and primarily treated at our institution between 1979 and 2004 were evaluated. Tumors were classified on basis of size and mitotic rate according to current National Institutes of Health recommendations: 67 percent (n = 12) were high-risk, 5 percent (n = 1) were intermediate-risk, 17 percent (n = 3) were low-risk, and 11 percent (n = 2) were very low-risk gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Fifteen of 18 tumors were KIT-positive. The three KIT-negative tumors were platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha positive. All patients with colonic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (n = 4) underwent segmental resection, whereas patients with rectal gastrointestinal stromal tumors had local excision (n = 5) or radical resection (n = 9). Sixty-six percent (8/12) of patients with high-risk colorectal gastrointestinal stromal tumors developed metastases. None of the patients (n = 6) with intermediate-risk, low-risk, or very low-risk gastrointestinal stromal tumors died of their disease after a median follow-up of 65 (range, 15-266) months.

Updated results of a phase I trial of motexafin lutetium-mediated interstitial photodynamic therapy in patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer.,"Journal of environmental pathology, toxicology and oncology : official organ of the International Society for Environmental Toxicology and Cancer",J. Environ. Pathol. Toxicol. Oncol.,2006-01-01,"Locally recurrent prostate cancer after treatment with radiation therapy is a clinical problem with few acceptable treatments. One potential treatment, photodynamic therapy (PDT), is a modality that uses laser light, drug photosensitizer, and oxygen to kill tumor cells through direct cellular cytotoxicity and/or through destruction of tumor vasculature. A Phase I trial of interstitial PDT with the photosensitizer Motexafin lutetium was initiated in men with locally recurrent prostate cancer. In this ongoing trial, the primary objective is to determine the maximally tolerated dose of Motexafin lutetium-mediated PDT. Other objectives include evaluation of Motexafin lutetium uptake from prostate tissue using a spectrofluorometric assay and evaluation of optical properties in the human prostate. Fifteen men with biopsy-proven locally recurrent prostate cancer and no evidence of distant metastatic disease have been enrolled and 14 have been treated. Treatment plans were developed using transrectal ultrasound images. The PDT dose was escalated by increasing the Motexafin lutetium dose, increasing the 732 ran light dose, and decreasing the drug-light interval. Motexafin lutetium doses ranged from 0.5 to 2 mg/kg administered IV 24, 6, or 3 hr prior to 732 ran light delivery. The light dose, measured in real time with in situ spherical detectors was 25-100 J/cm2. Light was delivered via optical fibers inserted through a transperineal brachytherapy template in the operating room. Optical property measurements were made before and after light therapy. Prostate biopsies were obtained before and after light delivery for spectrofluorometric measurements of photosensitizer uptake. Fourteen patients have completed protocol treatment on eight dose levels without dose-limiting toxicity. Grade I genitourinary symptoms that are PDT related have been observed. One patient had Grade II urinary urgency that was urinary catheter related. No rectal or other gastrointestinal PDT-related tox-icities have been observed to date. Measurements of Motexafin lutetium demonstrated the presence of photosensitizer in prostate tissue from all patients. Optical property measurements demonstrated substantial heterogeneity in the optical properties of the human prostate gland which supports the use of individualized treatment planning for prostate PDT.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",5133.0,64.0,Locally recurrent cancer after treatment with radiation therapy is a clinical problem with few acceptable treatments One potential treatment photodynamic therapy PDT is a modality that uses laser light drug photosensitizer and oxygen to kill tumor cells through direct cellular cytotoxicity and/or through destruction of tumor vasculature A Phase I trial of interstitial PDT with the photosensitizer Motexafin lutetium was initiated in men with locally recurrent cancer In this ongoing trial the primary objective is to determine the maximally tolerated dose of Motexafin lutetium-mediated PDT Other objectives include evaluation of Motexafin lutetium uptake from tissue using a spectrofluorometric assay and evaluation of optical properties in the human Fifteen men with biopsy-proven locally recurrent cancer and no evidence of distant metastatic disease have been enrolled and 14 have been treated Treatment plans were developed using transrectal ultrasound images The PDT dose was escalated by increasing the Motexafin lutetium dose increasing the 732 ran light dose and decreasing the drug-light interval Motexafin lutetium doses ranged from 0.5 to 2 mg/kg administered IV 24 6 or 3 hr prior to 732 ran light delivery The light dose measured in real time with in situ spherical detectors was 25-100 J/cm2 Light was delivered via optical fibers inserted through a transperineal brachytherapy template in the operating room Optical property measurements were made before and after light therapy biopsies were obtained before and after light delivery for spectrofluorometric measurements of photosensitizer uptake Fourteen patients have completed protocol treatment on eight dose levels without dose-limiting toxicity Grade I genitourinary symptoms that are PDT related have been observed One patient had Grade II urinary urgency that was urinary catheter related No or other PDT-related tox-icities have been observed to date Measurements of Motexafin lutetium demonstrated the presence of photosensitizer in tissue from all patients Optical property measurements demonstrated substantial heterogeneity in the optical properties of the human gland which supports the use of individualized treatment planning for PDT,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[795, 387, 12, 50, 24, 5, 121, 36, 16, 8, 38, 2497, 5, 1021, 1595, 640, 104, 174, 24, 6910, 36, 3442, 16, 8, 1396, 17, 4025, 3555, 1691, 234, 10687, 2, 2848, 6, 5097, 30, 37, 298, 1196, 763, 1408, 2, 15, 298, 4572, 1, 30, 3805, 8, 124, 70, 160, 1, 4543, 3442, 5, 3, 10687, 12300, 16690, 10, 1917, 4, 325, 5, 795, 387, 12, 4, 26, 942, 160, 3, 86, 461, 16, 6, 223, 3, 6402, 421, 61, 1, 12300, 16690, 517, 3442, 127, 2409, 643, 451, 1, 12300, 16690, 1135, 29, 246, 75, 8, 37162, 719, 2, 451, 1, 4303, 1571, 4, 3, 171, 3057, 325, 5, 411, 1930, 795, 387, 12, 2, 77, 241, 1, 626, 113, 34, 47, 85, 346, 2, 213, 47, 85, 73, 24, 1853, 11, 276, 75, 9409, 1945, 1572, 3, 3442, 61, 10, 2842, 20, 602, 3, 12300, 16690, 61, 602, 3, 10987, 22354, 1691, 61, 2, 2777, 3, 234, 1691, 268, 12300, 16690, 415, 1869, 29, 13, 33, 6, 18, 81, 503, 468, 478, 259, 49, 15, 27, 168, 324, 6, 10987, 22354, 1691, 989, 3, 1691, 61, 644, 4, 1589, 98, 5, 4, 957, 13312, 22046, 10, 243, 394, 3543, 13045, 1691, 10, 1623, 847, 4303, 12155, 9882, 298, 8, 16801, 1536, 5932, 4, 3, 2584, 4698, 4303, 9267, 1685, 11, 1229, 348, 2, 50, 1691, 36, 1154, 11, 683, 348, 2, 50, 1691, 989, 9, 37162, 1685, 1, 10687, 1135, 3225, 7, 47, 781, 1182, 24, 23, 659, 61, 148, 187, 61, 817, 155, 88, 70, 4109, 507, 17, 32, 3442, 139, 47, 85, 164, 104, 69, 42, 88, 215, 1660, 11431, 17, 10, 1660, 3925, 139, 77, 15, 127, 3442, 139, 16429, 55386, 47, 85, 164, 6, 1244, 1685, 1, 12300, 16690, 264, 3, 463, 1, 10687, 4, 246, 29, 62, 7, 4303, 9267, 1685, 264, 1281, 1144, 4, 3, 4303, 1571, 1, 3, 171, 2326, 92, 2304, 3, 119, 1, 2596, 24, 1349, 9, 3442]",2218.0,16566729,189

A dosimetric analysis of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) as an alternative to adjuvant high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy in early endometrial cancer patients.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2006-05-01,"To evaluate the role of intensity-modulated radiation treatment (IMRT) as an alternative to high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy in the treatment of the vagina in postoperative early endometrial cancer patients after surgery. Planning computed tomography (CT) scans of 10 patients previously treated with HDR were used in this study. In all cases, a dose of 700 cGy/fraction was prescribed at a distance of 0.5 cm from the cylinder surface. The same CT scans were then used in IMRT planning. In this paradigm, the vaginal cylinder represents a component of a hypothetical immobilization system that would be indexed to the linac treatment table. Our study showed that IMRT provided relatively lower rectal doses than HDR when treatment was prescribed at a distance of 0.5 cm away from the cylinder surface. Maximum rectal doses were lower with IMRT compared with HDR (average: 89.0% vs. 142.6%, respectively, p < 0.05). Moreover, the mean rectal dose was lower in IMRT plans compared with HDR plans with treatment prescribed either to the surface (average: 14.8% vs. 21.4%, respectively, p < 0.05) or to 0.5 cm (average: 19.6% vs. 33.5%, respectively, p < 0.05). IMRT plans had planning target volume (PTV) coverage comparable with HDR (average PTV minimum for treatment prescribed to 0.5 cm: 93.9% vs. 92.1%, p = 0.71, respectively) with less inhomogeneity (average PTV maximum: 110.8% vs. 381.6%, p < 0.05).

Ten-year results of preoperative radiation followed by sphincter preservation for rectal cancer: increased local failure rate in nonresponders.,Clinical colorectal cancer,Clin Colorectal Cancer,2006-03-01,"The primary objective of this study was to determine the long-term outcome of sphincter preservation with preoperative radiation therapy (RT) and surgical resection in the treatment of distal rectal adenocarcinoma. Between April 1988 and December 1996, 36 (cT2, n=9; cT3, n=27) patients with rectal adenocarcinoma were enrolled on a phase I/II trial of preoperative RT followed by surgical resection. All patients had distal tumors that were clinically judged to require an abdominoperineal resection and received preoperative RT (50.4 Gy) followed by surgery. The median follow-up was 94.5 months (range, 4-187 months). Of the 35 patients in this study who underwent resection, 77% were able to undergo sphincter preservation after preoperative RT. The pathologic complete response rate for these patients was 14%. The 10-year rates of overall survival and local failure for patients undergoing sphincter preservation were 54% and 21%, respectively. The 10-year local failure was 26% in patients with cT3 disease who underwent sphincter preservation. All local failures in this study occurred in patients with cT3 disease undergoing sphincter preservation; however, none of the patients with cT3 disease that was downstaged by preoperative RT experienced local failure. In contrast, 10-year local failure was 67% in the patients with cT3 disease that was not downstaged by RT. Sphincter function was good or excellent in 85% of patients at the time of last follow-up. This approach provides excellent long-term results in all patients with cT2 disease and those with cT3 disease that is downstaged by RT. However, patients with cT3 disease that is not downstaged by RT have an increased risk of local failure. These data underscore the impact of tumor response to radiation on long-term oncologic outcome.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",5074.0,,The primary objective of this study was to determine the long-term outcome of sphincter preservation with preoperative radiation therapy RT and surgical resection in the treatment of distal adenocarcinoma Between April 1988 and December 1996 36 cT2 n=9 cT3 n=27 patients with adenocarcinoma were enrolled on a phase I/II trial of preoperative RT followed by surgical resection All patients had distal tumors that were clinically judged to require an abdominoperineal resection and received preoperative RT 50.4 Gy followed by surgery The median follow-up was 94.5 months range 4-187 months Of the 35 patients in this study who underwent resection 77 were able to undergo sphincter preservation after preoperative RT The pathologic complete response rate for these patients was 14 The 10-year rates of overall survival and local failure for patients undergoing sphincter preservation were 54 and 21 respectively The 10-year local failure was 26 in patients with cT3 disease who underwent sphincter preservation All local failures in this study occurred in patients with cT3 disease undergoing sphincter preservation however none of the patients with cT3 disease that was downstaged by preoperative RT experienced local failure In contrast 10-year local failure was 67 in the patients with cT3 disease that was not downstaged by RT Sphincter function was good or excellent in 85 of patients at the time of last follow-up This approach provides excellent long-term results in all patients with cT2 disease and those with cT3 disease that is downstaged by RT However patients with cT3 disease that is not downstaged by RT have an increased risk of local failure These data underscore the impact of tumor response to radiation on long-term oncologic outcome,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[3, 86, 461, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 223, 3, 319, 337, 228, 1, 5400, 2224, 5, 498, 121, 36, 240, 2, 221, 170, 4, 3, 24, 1, 2107, 449, 59, 2292, 3314, 2, 1397, 2648, 511, 8703, 78, 83, 11036, 78, 428, 7, 5, 449, 11, 346, 23, 8, 124, 70, 215, 160, 1, 498, 240, 370, 20, 221, 170, 62, 7, 42, 2107, 57, 17, 11, 505, 7249, 6, 1353, 35, 8177, 170, 2, 103, 498, 240, 212, 39, 381, 370, 20, 152, 3, 52, 166, 126, 10, 960, 33, 53, 184, 39, 5568, 53, 1, 3, 465, 7, 4, 26, 45, 54, 208, 170, 849, 11, 1665, 6, 1251, 5400, 2224, 50, 498, 240, 3, 510, 236, 51, 116, 9, 46, 7, 10, 213, 3, 79, 111, 151, 1, 63, 25, 2, 293, 496, 9, 7, 479, 5400, 2224, 11, 667, 2, 239, 106, 3, 79, 111, 293, 496, 10, 432, 4, 7, 5, 11036, 34, 54, 208, 5400, 2224, 62, 293, 3368, 4, 26, 45, 489, 4, 7, 5, 11036, 34, 479, 5400, 2224, 137, 1292, 1, 3, 7, 5, 11036, 34, 17, 10, 9434, 20, 498, 240, 592, 293, 496, 4, 748, 79, 111, 293, 496, 10, 598, 4, 3, 7, 5, 11036, 34, 17, 10, 44, 9434, 20, 240, 5400, 343, 10, 1178, 15, 1503, 4, 772, 1, 7, 28, 3, 98, 1, 1060, 166, 126, 26, 353, 777, 1503, 319, 337, 99, 4, 62, 7, 5, 8703, 34, 2, 135, 5, 11036, 34, 17, 16, 9434, 20, 240, 137, 7, 5, 11036, 34, 17, 16, 44, 9434, 20, 240, 47, 35, 101, 43, 1, 293, 496, 46, 74, 5531, 3, 345, 1, 30, 51, 6, 121, 23, 319, 337, 1998, 228]",1752.0,16635280,4

This phase I/II study evaluated the addition of weekly oxaliplatin to preoperative continuous infusion fluorouracil (FU) and external-beam radiation therapy (RT) in patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma. Patients with clinical T3/T4 rectal adenocarcinoma and no evidence of metastases were treated with weekly oxaliplatin, continuous infusion FU 200 mg/m2 intravenously, and RT. A total of 6 weekly doses of oxaliplatin were planned. RT dose was 1.8 Gy/fraction to a total dose of 50.4 Gy. In the phase I portion, oxaliplatin was escalated from 30 to 60 mg/m2. Forty-four patients were entered onto the study, 18 on the phase I portion and 26 on the phase II portion. The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) for oxaliplatin was determined to be 60 mg/m2. At the MTD, 12 patients experienced grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, two patients experienced grade 3 neutropenia, and one patient experienced grade 3 thrombocytopenia. Fifty-six percent of patients entered at the MTD completed all 6 weeks of oxaliplatin. Eight (25%) of 32 patients enrolled at the phase II dose experienced a pathologic complete response. In this multicenter study, the addition of oxaliplatin to intravenous continuous infusion FU and RT for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer was associated with a high pathologic complete response rate but more toxicity than when FU is used alone.

Modern management of rectal cancer: a 2006 update.,World journal of gastroenterology,World J. Gastroenterol.,2006-05-01,"The goal of this review is to outline some of the important surgical issues surrounding the management of patients with early (T1/T2 and N0), as well as locally advanced (T3/T4 and/or N1) rectal cancer. Surgery for rectal cancer continues to develop towards the ultimate goals of improved local control and overall survival, maintaining quality of life, and preserving sphincter, genitourinary, and sexual function. Information concerning the depth of tumor penetration through the rectal wall, lymph node involvement, and presence of distant metastatic disease is of crucial importance when planning a curative rectal cancer resection. Preoperative staging is used to determine the indication for neoadjuvant therapy as well as the indication for local excision versus radical cancer resection. Local excision is likely to be curative in most patients with a primary tumor which is limited to the submucosa (T1N0M0), without high-risk features and in the absence of metastatic disease. In appropriate patients, minimally invasive procedures, such as local excision, TEM, and laparoscopic resection allow for improved patient comfort, shorter hospital stays, and earlier return to preoperative activity level. Once the tumor invades the muscularis propria (T2), radical rectal resection in acceptable operative candidates is recommended. In patients with transmural and/or node positive disease (T3/T4 and/or N1) with no distant metastases, preoperative chemoradiation followed by radical resection according to the principles of TME has become widely accepted. During the planning and conduct of a radical operation for a locally advanced rectal cancer, a number of surgical management issues are considered, including: (1) total mesorectal excision (TME); (2) autonomic nerve preservation (ANP); (3) circumferential resection margin (CRM); (4) distal resection margin; (5) sphincter preservation and options for restoration of bowel continuity; (6) laparoscopic approaches; and (7) postoperative quality of life.",Journal Article,5013.0,101.0,The goal of this review is to outline some of the important surgical issues surrounding the management of patients with early T1/T2 and N0 as well as locally advanced T3/T4 and/or N1 cancer Surgery for cancer continues to develop towards the ultimate goals of improved local control and overall survival maintaining quality of life and preserving sphincter genitourinary and sexual function Information concerning the depth of tumor penetration through the wall lymph node involvement and presence of distant metastatic disease is of crucial importance when planning a curative cancer resection Preoperative staging is used to determine the indication for neoadjuvant therapy as well as the indication for local excision versus radical cancer resection Local excision is likely to be curative in most patients with a primary tumor which is limited to the submucosa T1N0M0 without high-risk features and in the absence of metastatic disease In appropriate patients minimally invasive procedures such as local excision TEM and laparoscopic resection allow for improved patient comfort shorter hospital stays and earlier return to preoperative activity level Once the tumor invades the muscularis propria T2 radical resection in acceptable operative candidates is recommended In patients with transmural and/or node positive disease T3/T4 and/or N1 with no distant metastases preoperative chemoradiation followed by radical resection according to the principles of TME has become widely accepted During the planning and conduct of a radical operation for a locally advanced cancer a number of surgical management issues are considered including 1 total mesorectal excision TME 2 autonomic nerve preservation ANP 3 circumferential resection margin CRM 4 distal resection margin 5 sphincter preservation and options for restoration of bowel continuity 6 laparoscopic approaches and 7 postoperative quality of life,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[3, 1326, 1, 26, 206, 16, 6, 5277, 476, 1, 3, 305, 221, 1553, 2976, 3, 284, 1, 7, 5, 191, 1534, 1786, 2, 3394, 22, 149, 22, 795, 131, 2065, 2463, 2, 15, 3192, 12, 152, 9, 12, 2274, 6, 690, 3113, 3, 5768, 2802, 1, 231, 293, 182, 2, 63, 25, 3284, 372, 1, 358, 2, 4972, 5400, 4109, 2, 2232, 343, 487, 4243, 3, 2436, 1, 30, 4618, 298, 3, 2397, 263, 289, 799, 2, 463, 1, 626, 113, 34, 16, 1, 2653, 1187, 198, 1349, 8, 1075, 12, 170, 498, 632, 16, 95, 6, 223, 3, 3607, 9, 536, 36, 22, 149, 22, 3, 3607, 9, 293, 1366, 185, 711, 12, 170, 293, 1366, 16, 322, 6, 40, 1075, 4, 96, 7, 5, 8, 86, 30, 92, 16, 383, 6, 3, 13924, 17188, 187, 64, 43, 404, 2, 4, 3, 1127, 1, 113, 34, 4, 870, 7, 2144, 416, 1369, 225, 22, 293, 1366, 9594, 2, 1964, 170, 1700, 9, 231, 69, 8300, 985, 702, 10472, 2, 1677, 4656, 6, 498, 128, 301, 1059, 3, 30, 24786, 3, 13936, 10859, 1786, 711, 170, 4, 1595, 1208, 1931, 16, 793, 4, 7, 5, 24421, 2, 15, 289, 109, 34, 2065, 2463, 2, 15, 3192, 5, 77, 626, 196, 498, 975, 370, 20, 711, 170, 768, 6, 3, 4650, 1, 5145, 71, 1417, 1792, 3058, 190, 3, 1349, 2, 4073, 1, 8, 711, 2589, 9, 8, 795, 131, 12, 8, 207, 1, 221, 284, 1553, 32, 515, 141, 14, 181, 5823, 1366, 5145, 18, 12805, 2476, 2224, 18451, 27, 7937, 170, 959, 12620, 39, 2107, 170, 959, 33, 5400, 2224, 2, 838, 9, 5194, 1, 1659, 12253, 49, 1964, 611, 2, 67, 573, 372, 1, 358]",1908.0,16718838,476

Sacral resection for recurrent rectal cancer: analysis of morbidity and treatment results.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2006-08-01,"Composite sacropelvic resection for locally advanced recurrent rectal cancer is a high-risk procedure that benefits select patients. We reviewed our recent institutional experience to evaluate case selection, morbidity, and outcomes. Between 1987 and 2004, 29 patients underwent composite resection for recurrent locoregional rectal cancer (17 females; median age, 60 years). Clinicopathologic indicators were evaluated as indicators of survival by log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model. Of 29 total patients, 27 (93 percent) received radiotherapy with their previous surgery (n = 10; 34 percent) or before sacrectomy (n = 17; 59 percent), and 12 (41 percent) received intraoperative therapy. Sacral resections were performed at S2/S3 (55 percent) or S4/S5 (45 percent) using anterior (41 percent) or combined anterior-posterior approach (59 percent), with adherence to (62 percent) or cortical invasion in (38 percent) the sacrum. A majority of those who had undergone previous abdominoperineal resection had total exenteration (9/13), whereas most patients who had undergone a previous sphincter-preserving procedure had abdominoperineal resection (12/16) and none had exenteration. Pedicle flaps (omental, 11; abdominal rectus, 7) often were used. A median of five (range, 1-33) units of blood was given intraoperatively. Transfusions were associated with previous abdominoperineal resection (P < 0.03), correlating strongly with postoperative morbidity (P < 0.02). There were 33 complications in 17 (59 percent) patients, most commonly perineal wound breakdown (9 (31 percent)) and pelvic abscess (5 (17 percent)). Median hospital stay was 18 (range, 7-56) days, significantly longer in patients with previous abdominoperineal resection (P < 0.02) or postoperative morbidity (P < 0.03). The only postoperative death was from pelvic sepsis. Resection was complete (R0) in 18 patients (62 percent), with microscopically positive margins (R1) in 10 (34 percent) and grossly positive margins (R2) in 1 (3 percent). Two-year and five-year recurrence rates were 47 and 85 percent, respectively; disease-specific survival was 63 and 20 percent, respectively. Less transfusion (P = 0.03), R0 resection (P = 0.005), lack of anterior organ involvement (P = 0.02), and absence of cortical bone invasion (P < 0.001) were associated with better survival on univariate analysis; original colorectal cancer stage was not.

Advances in chemotherapy for colorectal cancer.,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,Clin. Gastroenterol. Hepatol.,2006-06-22,"Gastroenterologists have a primary role in the management of colorectal cancer patients in that they frequently establish the diagnosis, direct or perform tumor staging evaluations, and initiate referrals for oncologic treatment. Several important advances have been made in the adjuvant treatment of colon and rectal cancers and in therapy of metastatic disease. These advances include the development of more effective combination chemotherapy regimens and molecularly targeted antibodies. These antibodies are directed against regulators of angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor) and tumor cell growth (epidermal growth factor receptor) and have been shown to enhance the efficacy of cytotoxic chemotherapy. In the treatment of localized rectal cancer, the integration of chemotherapy and radiation with surgery has resulted in neoadjuvant approaches that achieve improved tumor control, sphincter preservation, and reduce treatment-related toxicities.

Celecoxib treatment alters the gene expression profile of normal colonic mucosa.,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev.,2006-07-01,"A clinical trial was recently conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (celecoxib) in hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer patients. In a randomized, placebo-controlled phase I/II multicenter trial, hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer patients and gene carriers received either celecoxib at one of two doses or placebo. The goal was to evaluate the effects of these treatment arms on a number of endoscopic and tissue-based biomarker end points after 12 months of treatment. As part of this trial, we analyzed gene expression by cDNA array technology in normal descending (rectal) colonic mucosa of patients before and after treatment with celecoxib or placebo. We found that treatment of patients with celecoxib at recommended clinical doses (200 and 400 mg p.o. bid), in contrast to treatment with placebo, leads to changes in expression of >1,400 genes in the healthy colon, although in general, the magnitude of changes is <2-fold. Twenty-three of 25 pairs of colon biopsies taken before and after celecoxib treatment can be classified correctly by the pattern of gene expression in a leave-one-out cross-validation. Immune response, particularly T- and B-lymphocyte activation and early steps of inflammatory reaction, cell signaling and cell adhesion, response to stress, transforming growth factor-beta signaling, and regulation of apoptosis, are the main biological processes targeted by celecoxib as shown by overrepresentation analysis of the distribution of celecoxib-affected genes across Gene Ontology categories. Analysis of possible cumulative effects of celecoxib-induced changes in gene expression indicates that in healthy colon, celecoxib may suppress the immune response and early steps of inflammation, inhibit formation of focal contacts, and stimulate transforming growth factor-beta signaling.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",4952.0,22.0,"A clinical trial was recently conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 celecoxib in hereditary nonpolyposis cancer patients In a randomized placebo-controlled phase I/II multicenter trial hereditary nonpolyposis cancer patients and gene carriers received either celecoxib at one of two doses or placebo The goal was to evaluate the effects of these treatment arms on a number of endoscopic and tissue-based biomarker end points after 12 months of treatment As part of this trial we analyzed gene expression by cDNA array technology in normal descending colonic mucosa of patients before and after treatment with celecoxib or placebo We found that treatment of patients with celecoxib at recommended clinical doses 200 and 400 mg p.o bid in contrast to treatment with placebo leads to changes in expression of 1,400 genes in the healthy although in general the magnitude of changes is 2-fold Twenty-three of 25 pairs of biopsies taken before and after celecoxib treatment can be classified correctly by the pattern of gene expression in a leave-one-out cross-validation Immune response particularly T- and B-lymphocyte activation and early steps of inflammatory reaction cell signaling and cell adhesion response to stress transforming growth factor-beta signaling and regulation of apoptosis are the main biological processes targeted by celecoxib as shown by overrepresentation analysis of the distribution of celecoxib-affected genes across Gene Ontology categories Analysis of possible cumulative effects of celecoxib-induced changes in gene expression indicates that in healthy celecoxib may suppress the immune response and early steps of inflammation inhibit formation of focal contacts and stimulate transforming growth factor-beta signaling",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[8, 38, 160, 10, 761, 426, 6, 376, 3, 367, 2, 209, 1, 8, 1094, 230, 1, 4043, 18, 2673, 4, 2305, 10786, 12, 7, 4, 8, 384, 619, 1149, 124, 70, 215, 1570, 160, 2305, 10786, 12, 7, 2, 145, 1316, 103, 361, 2673, 28, 104, 1, 100, 415, 15, 619, 3, 1326, 10, 6, 376, 3, 176, 1, 46, 24, 1335, 23, 8, 207, 1, 2056, 2, 246, 90, 901, 396, 862, 50, 133, 53, 1, 24, 22, 760, 1, 26, 160, 21, 311, 145, 55, 20, 4212, 1926, 2033, 4, 295, 13478, 3663, 2713, 1, 7, 348, 2, 50, 24, 5, 2673, 15, 619, 21, 204, 17, 24, 1, 7, 5, 2673, 28, 793, 38, 415, 1250, 2, 1524, 81, 19, 1990, 2793, 4, 748, 6, 24, 5, 619, 1940, 6, 400, 4, 55, 1, 14, 1524, 214, 4, 3, 1331, 242, 4, 1083, 3, 3131, 1, 400, 16, 18, 1116, 737, 169, 1, 243, 2773, 1, 1154, 1633, 348, 2, 50, 2673, 24, 122, 40, 1373, 4911, 20, 3, 1177, 1, 145, 55, 4, 8, 8678, 104, 1205, 1383, 929, 250, 51, 823, 102, 2, 132, 1448, 363, 2, 191, 4022, 1, 1291, 1329, 31, 314, 2, 31, 2128, 51, 6, 1531, 3621, 129, 161, 1090, 314, 2, 863, 1, 351, 32, 3, 1895, 1037, 1849, 238, 20, 2673, 22, 443, 20, 19547, 65, 1, 3, 1395, 1, 2673, 1424, 214, 716, 145, 11843, 1996, 65, 1, 899, 967, 176, 1, 2673, 277, 400, 4, 145, 55, 2640, 17, 4, 1331, 2673, 68, 3134, 3, 250, 51, 2, 191, 4022, 1, 1815, 1433, 1264, 1, 2137, 13291, 2, 4223, 3621, 129, 161, 1090, 314]",1798.0,16835340,14
Gene expression in tumor-adjacent normal tissue is associated with recurrence in patients with rectal cancer treated with adjuvant chemoradiation.,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,Pharmacogenet. Genomics,2006-08-01,"Recurrence is a significant clinical problem for patients with rectal cancer treated with adjuvant chemoradiation. Previous studies have suggested that determining intratumoral gene expression of key genes may be helpful in predicting clinical outcome of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies undergoing chemotherapy. The role of molecular predictors for prediction of recurrence in the setting of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy is not well established. The present study was designed to identify a genetic profile that would be associated with recurrence in patients with rectal cancer treated with adjuvant chemoradiation therapy. A retrospective study with a longitudinal cohort and a cross-sectional cohort of 67 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who underwent cancer resection, followed by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) plus pelvic radiation was conducted. Total RNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, laser-captured-microdissected tissue. We determined mRNA levels of genes involved in the 5-FU pathway (thymidylate synthase, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase), DNA-repair (excision-repair cross-complementing factor 1, Rad51), angiogenesis/radiation sensitivity [vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)] and radio-sensitivity [epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)] in tumor tissue and tumor-adjacent normal tissue by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. In univariate analysis, only intratumoral gene expression level of VEGF (P = 0.055) was associated with recurrence, whereas elevated mRNA expression levels of thymidylate synthase (P = 0.008), VEGF (P = 0.023) and EGFR (P = 0.004) in tumor-adjacent normal tissue were significantly associated with recurrence. Multivariate analysis using recursive partitioning indicated that distinct groups of recurrence could be defined by elevated mRNA expression levels of VEGF, EGFR in tumor-adjacent normal tissue, and Rad51 in tumor tissue. These data suggest that the genetic profile of the tumor-adjacent normal tissue may be associated with treatment failure, indicating that tumor microenvironment may be more important in the development of recurrence of rectal tumors than formerly expected.",Comparative Study,4921.0,20.0,Recurrence is a significant clinical problem for patients with cancer treated with adjuvant chemoradiation Previous studies have suggested that determining intratumoral gene expression of key genes may be helpful in predicting clinical outcome of patients with malignancies undergoing chemotherapy The role of molecular predictors for prediction of recurrence in the setting of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy is not well established The present study was designed to identify a genetic profile that would be associated with recurrence in patients with cancer treated with adjuvant chemoradiation therapy A retrospective study with a longitudinal cohort and a cross-sectional cohort of 67 patients with locally advanced cancer who underwent cancer resection followed by 5-fluorouracil 5-FU plus pelvic radiation was conducted Total RNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded laser-captured-microdissected tissue We determined mRNA levels of genes involved in the 5-FU pathway thymidylate synthase dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase DNA-repair excision-repair cross-complementing factor 1 Rad51 angiogenesis/radiation sensitivity vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF and radio-sensitivity epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR in tumor tissue and tumor-adjacent normal tissue by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction In univariate analysis only intratumoral gene expression level of VEGF P 0.055 was associated with recurrence whereas elevated mRNA expression levels of thymidylate synthase P 0.008 VEGF P 0.023 and EGFR P 0.004 in tumor-adjacent normal tissue were significantly associated with recurrence Multivariate analysis using recursive partitioning indicated that distinct groups of recurrence could be defined by elevated mRNA expression levels of VEGF EGFR in tumor-adjacent normal tissue and Rad51 in tumor tissue These data suggest that the genetic profile of the tumor-adjacent normal tissue may be associated with treatment failure indicating that tumor microenvironment may be more important in the development of recurrence of tumors than formerly expected,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[146, 16, 8, 93, 38, 2497, 9, 7, 5, 12, 73, 5, 249, 975, 698, 94, 47, 1148, 17, 2196, 2074, 145, 55, 1, 825, 214, 68, 40, 3951, 4, 1434, 38, 228, 1, 7, 5, 441, 479, 56, 3, 200, 1, 219, 674, 9, 1590, 1, 146, 4, 3, 546, 1, 249, 1464, 16, 44, 149, 635, 3, 364, 45, 10, 1114, 6, 255, 8, 336, 800, 17, 688, 40, 41, 5, 146, 4, 7, 5, 12, 73, 5, 249, 975, 36, 8, 459, 45, 5, 8, 2380, 180, 2, 8, 1383, 2832, 180, 1, 598, 7, 5, 795, 131, 12, 54, 208, 12, 170, 370, 20, 33, 1404, 33, 1296, 349, 1110, 121, 10, 426, 181, 893, 10, 2484, 29, 3265, 1959, 2487, 2505, 3555, 4954, 9418, 246, 21, 509, 956, 148, 1, 214, 646, 4, 3, 33, 1296, 308, 6205, 3522, 14398, 2374, 261, 972, 1366, 972, 1383, 10455, 161, 14, 4671, 1056, 121, 485, 756, 845, 129, 161, 618, 2, 6477, 485, 829, 129, 161, 153, 227, 4, 30, 246, 2, 30, 2086, 295, 246, 20, 1156, 1772, 4456, 1451, 1260, 1329, 4, 880, 65, 158, 2074, 145, 55, 301, 1, 618, 19, 13, 9186, 10, 41, 5, 146, 547, 804, 956, 55, 148, 1, 6205, 3522, 19, 13, 2155, 618, 19, 13, 4482, 2, 227, 19, 13, 1520, 4, 30, 2086, 295, 246, 11, 97, 41, 5, 146, 331, 65, 75, 4493, 4515, 1103, 17, 834, 271, 1, 146, 359, 40, 395, 20, 804, 956, 55, 148, 1, 618, 227, 4, 30, 2086, 295, 246, 2, 4671, 4, 30, 246, 46, 74, 309, 17, 3, 336, 800, 1, 3, 30, 2086, 295, 246, 68, 40, 41, 5, 24, 496, 1716, 17, 30, 995, 68, 40, 80, 305, 4, 3, 193, 1, 146, 1, 57, 76, 7350, 1336]",2103.0,16847424,434
A pathologic complete response of rectal cancer to preoperative combined-modality therapy results in improved oncological outcome compared with those who achieve no downstaging on the basis of preoperative endorectal ultrasonography.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2006-07-24,"Preoperative combined-modality therapy (CMT) is the preferred treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer (endorectal ultrasonography [ERUS] T3-4, N1, or clinically bulky) and achieves a pathologic complete response (pCR) in 4% to 33% of patients. However, the prognostic significance of pCR remains unclear. A prospectively collected database was queried to identify 200 patients with locally advanced disease treated from 1992 to 2002. The pCR group was defined as having no evidence of viable tumor on pathologic analysis. The no-downstaging group was defined as no difference between the pre-CMT ERUS stage and the pathologic stage. Those achieving some downstaging but not pCR were excluded. Patients were treated with CMT (5040 cGy of radiation and 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy) followed by surgery, and 51 (85%) in the pCR group and 129 (92%) in the no-downstaging group (P = .1) received postoperative chemotherapy. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were determined by using the Kaplan-Meier method. The median follow-up was 38.6 months (range, 18.2-124.9 months). The pCR (n = 60) and control (n = 140) groups were similar in age (P = .6), sex (P = .4), distance of the tumor from the anal verge (P = .3), pre-CMT ERUS stage (P = .2), and comorbidities (P = .2). The 5-year RFS was 96% and 54% in the pCR and control groups, respectively (P < .00001); the 5-year OS was 90% and 68% (P = .009). Sphincter-preservation rates were higher in the pCR group (P = .01). Rectal cancer patients with pCR after preoperative CMT have improved RFS, OS, and sphincter preservation compared with patients without downstaging. Because pCR seems to be associated with better outcome, an understanding of the factors governing the response to CMT should be pursued.",Journal Article,4929.0,137.0,Preoperative combined-modality therapy CMT is the preferred treatment for locally advanced cancer endorectal ultrasonography ERUS T3-4 N1 or clinically bulky and achieves a pathologic complete response pCR in 4 to 33 of patients However the prognostic significance of pCR remains unclear A prospectively collected database was queried to identify 200 patients with locally advanced disease treated from 1992 to 2002 The pCR group was defined as having no evidence of viable tumor on pathologic analysis The no-downstaging group was defined as no difference between the pre-CMT ERUS stage and the pathologic stage Those achieving some downstaging but not pCR were excluded Patients were treated with CMT 5040 cGy of radiation and 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy followed by surgery and 51 85 in the pCR group and 129 92 in the no-downstaging group P .1 received postoperative chemotherapy Recurrence-free survival RFS and overall survival OS were determined by using the Kaplan-Meier method The median follow-up was 38.6 months range 18.2-124.9 months The pCR n 60 and control n 140 groups were similar in age P .6 sex P .4 distance of the tumor from the verge P .3 pre-CMT ERUS stage P .2 and comorbidities P .2 The 5-year RFS was 96 and 54 in the pCR and control groups respectively P .00001 the 5-year OS was 90 and 68 P .009 Sphincter-preservation rates were higher in the pCR group P .01 cancer patients with pCR after preoperative CMT have improved RFS OS and sphincter preservation compared with patients without downstaging Because pCR seems to be associated with better outcome an understanding of the factors governing the response to CMT should be pursued,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[498, 397, 1396, 36, 5380, 16, 3, 2514, 24, 9, 795, 131, 12, 5615, 4244, 16345, 2065, 39, 3192, 15, 505, 4112, 2, 6358, 8, 510, 236, 51, 604, 4, 39, 6, 466, 1, 7, 137, 3, 177, 724, 1, 604, 469, 1200, 8, 1143, 786, 609, 10, 3547, 6, 255, 1250, 7, 5, 795, 131, 34, 73, 29, 2846, 6, 1544, 3, 604, 87, 10, 395, 22, 1041, 77, 241, 1, 2663, 30, 23, 510, 65, 3, 77, 5336, 87, 10, 395, 22, 77, 523, 59, 3, 671, 5380, 16345, 82, 2, 3, 510, 82, 135, 1785, 476, 5336, 84, 44, 604, 11, 1800, 7, 11, 73, 5, 5380, 18992, 3071, 1, 121, 2, 33, 1404, 90, 56, 370, 20, 152, 2, 725, 772, 4, 3, 604, 87, 2, 4649, 937, 4, 3, 77, 5336, 87, 19, 14, 103, 573, 56, 146, 115, 25, 1272, 2, 63, 25, 118, 11, 509, 20, 75, 3, 876, 882, 596, 3, 52, 166, 126, 10, 519, 49, 53, 184, 203, 18, 2834, 83, 53, 3, 604, 78, 335, 2, 182, 78, 3304, 271, 11, 288, 4, 89, 19, 49, 1035, 19, 39, 3019, 1, 3, 30, 29, 3, 8330, 19, 27, 671, 5380, 16345, 82, 19, 18, 2, 1909, 19, 18, 3, 33, 111, 1272, 10, 921, 2, 667, 4, 3, 604, 2, 182, 271, 106, 19, 7868, 3, 33, 111, 118, 10, 424, 2, 806, 19, 2376, 5400, 2224, 151, 11, 142, 4, 3, 604, 87, 19, 355, 12, 7, 5, 604, 50, 498, 5380, 47, 231, 1272, 118, 2, 5400, 2224, 72, 5, 7, 187, 5336, 408, 604, 2744, 6, 40, 41, 5, 380, 228, 35, 612, 1, 3, 130, 10179, 3, 51, 6, 5380, 257, 40, 5299]",1667.0,16865595,55
Phase III trial of fluorouracil-based chemotherapy regimens plus radiotherapy in postoperative adjuvant rectal cancer: GI INT 0144.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2006-08-01,"Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy after or before resection of high-risk rectal cancer improves overall survival (OS) and pelvic control. We studied three postoperative fluorouracil (FU) radiochemotherapy regimens. After resection of T3-4, N0, M0 or T1-4, N1, 2M0 rectal adenocarcinoma, 1,917 patients were randomly assigned to arm 1, with bolus FU in two 5-day cycles every 28 days before and after radiotherapy (XRT) plus FU via protracted venous infusion (PVI) 225 mg/m2/d during XRT; arm 2 (PVI-only arm), with PVI 42 days before and 56 days after XRT + PVI; or arm 3 (bolus-only arm), with bolus FU + leucovorin (LV) in two 5-day cycles before and after XRT, plus bolus FU + LV (levamisole was administered each cycle before and after XRT). Patients were stratified by operation type, T and N stage, and time from surgery. Median follow-up was 5.7 years. Lethal toxicity was less than 1%, with grade 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity in 49% to 55% of the bolus arms versus 4% in the PVI arm. No disease-free survival (DFS) or OS difference was detected (3-year DFS, 67% to 69% and 3-year OS, 81% to 83% in all arms). Locoregional failure (LRF) at first relapse was 8% in arm 1, 4.6% in arm 2, and 7% in arm 3.

The role of chemoradiotherapy in patients with T2, N0 and early T3, N0 rectal cancer, treated by radical surgery with total mesorectal excision, remains controversial. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of recurrence in this group of patients to enhance treatment selection. One hundred patients with primary T2-3, N0 adenocarcinoma of the rectum, uniformly treated by surgery alone, were studied. The pathology slides available for 97 patients were rereviewed. Three patients with incomplete data sets were excluded. Clinical and survival data were obtained from a prospective computerized database and updated from hospital and office charts. The study end points were disease-free survival, disease-specific survival (DSS), time to pelvic recurrence (PR), and distant recurrence. Complete follow-up was available for all study patients. Median follow-up was 79.5 months (range, 57.7 to 105.9 months). During this time period 30 patients (31.9%) died as a result of disease and 64 patients (68.1%) remained alive and disease free. Five-year DSS was 73%. The cumulative risk for PR was 8% at 5 years and 10% at 8 years. Lymphovascular invasion, preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA > 5 ng/mL) level, and age older than 70 years were all associated with adverse outcome.

Phase I dose escalation clinical trial of phenylbutyrate sodium administered twice daily to patients with advanced solid tumors.,Investigational new drugs,Invest New Drugs,2006-10-20,"Phenylbutyrate (PBA), and its metabolite phenylacetate (PAA), induce growth inhibition and cellular differentiation in multiple tumor models. However, despite their potential anti-cancer properties, several pharmacodynamic aspects remain unknown. We conducted a dose escalating trial to evaluate twice-daily intravenous PBA infusions for two consecutive weeks (Monday through Friday) every month at five dose levels (60-360 mg/kg/day). Twenty-one patients with the following malignancies were treated: colon carcinoma 4, non-small cell lung carcinoma 4; anaplastic astrocytoma 3, glioblastoma multiforme 3, bladder carcinoma 2, sarcoma 2, and ovarian carcinoma, rectal hemangiopericytoma, and pancreatic carcinoma 1 each. Conversion of PBA to PAA and phenylacetylglutamine (PAG) was documented without catabolic saturation. Plasma content of PBA > or =1 mM was documented for only 3 h following each dose at the top two dosages. The therapy was well tolerated overall. Common adverse effects included grade 1 nausea/vomiting, fatigue, and lightheadedness. Dose limiting toxicities were short-term memory loss, sedation, confusion, nausea, and vomiting. Two patients with anaplastic astrocytoma and a patient with glioblastoma remained stable without tumor progression for 5, 7, and 4 months respectively.

Carcinoid of the rectum risk stratification (CaRRS): a strategy for preoperative outcome assessment.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2006-11-09,"Predicting rectal carcinoid behavior exclusively on the basis of tumor size is imprecise. We sought to identify factors associated with outcome and incorporate them into a preoperative risk stratification scheme. Seventy patients with rectal carcinoid evaluated at our institution were identified. Demographic, clinical, and histopathologic data were collected and correlated with recurrence and survival. The mean age of our cohort was 53.6 years. Fifty-seven percent of patients were women. The mean tumor size was 1.3 cm (range, .1-5 cm). Twenty-five percent of patients had deeply invasive tumors (into the muscularis propria or deeper); an equal percentage had tumors with lymphovascular invasion (LVI) or an increased mitotic rate (two or more mitoses per 50 high-power fields). Eleven patients (17%) had distant metastases at presentation. Sixty-one patients were followed for a median of 22 months (range, 2-308 months), during which seven patients developed recurrence and seven died of disease (including two of seven whose disease recurred). Poor outcome was associated with large tumor size, deep invasion, presence of LVI, and increased mitotic rate. These factors were incorporated into a Carcinoid of the Rectum Risk Stratification (CaRRS) score. CaRRS predicted recurrence-free and disease-specific survival better than any single factor alone. Poor prognostic features of rectal carcinoids include large size, deep invasion, LVI, and increased mitotic rate. The CaRRS score incorporates these features and accurately predicts outcome. Because the CaRRS score is based on values available by preoperative biopsy, it can identify patients with favorable prognosis and those with poor prognosis who may benefit from additional staging or surveillance.",Journal Article,4821.0,73.0,Predicting behavior exclusively on the basis of tumor size is imprecise We sought to identify factors associated with outcome and incorporate them into a preoperative risk stratification scheme Seventy patients with evaluated at our institution were identified Demographic clinical and histopathologic data were collected and correlated with recurrence and survival The mean age of our cohort was 53.6 years Fifty-seven percent of patients were women The mean tumor size was 1.3 cm range .1-5 cm Twenty-five percent of patients had deeply invasive tumors into the muscularis propria or deeper an equal percentage had tumors with lymphovascular invasion LVI or an increased mitotic rate two or more mitoses per 50 high-power fields Eleven patients 17 had distant metastases at presentation Sixty-one patients were followed for a median of 22 months range 2-308 months during which seven patients developed recurrence and seven died of disease including two of seven whose disease recurred Poor outcome was associated with large tumor size deep invasion presence of LVI and increased mitotic rate These factors were incorporated into a of the Rectum Risk Stratification CaRRS score CaRRS predicted recurrence-free and disease-specific survival better than any single factor alone Poor prognostic features of carcinoids include large size deep invasion LVI and increased mitotic rate The CaRRS score incorporates these features and accurately predicts outcome Because the CaRRS score is based on values available by preoperative biopsy it can identify patients with favorable prognosis and those with poor prognosis who may benefit from additional staging or surveillance,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[1434, 1710, 4437, 23, 3, 877, 1, 30, 444, 16, 18486, 21, 990, 6, 255, 130, 41, 5, 228, 2, 3360, 1370, 237, 8, 498, 43, 1541, 4633, 2073, 7, 5, 194, 28, 114, 731, 11, 108, 1540, 38, 2, 2630, 74, 11, 786, 2, 438, 5, 146, 2, 25, 3, 313, 89, 1, 114, 180, 10, 699, 49, 60, 1461, 648, 714, 1, 7, 11, 117, 3, 313, 30, 444, 10, 14, 27, 494, 184, 14, 33, 494, 737, 365, 714, 1, 7, 42, 16394, 416, 57, 237, 3, 13936, 10859, 15, 6029, 35, 2997, 1150, 42, 57, 5, 2933, 578, 3327, 15, 35, 101, 2346, 116, 100, 15, 80, 7246, 379, 212, 64, 2349, 3130, 2627, 7, 269, 42, 626, 196, 28, 1031, 1746, 104, 7, 11, 370, 9, 8, 52, 1, 350, 53, 184, 18, 7786, 53, 190, 92, 648, 7, 276, 146, 2, 648, 1016, 1, 34, 141, 100, 1, 648, 1310, 34, 3363, 334, 228, 10, 41, 5, 375, 30, 444, 2369, 578, 463, 1, 3327, 2, 101, 2346, 116, 46, 130, 11, 2449, 237, 8, 1, 3, 3660, 43, 1541, 24963, 368, 24963, 783, 146, 115, 2, 34, 112, 25, 380, 76, 500, 226, 161, 279, 334, 177, 404, 1, 9878, 643, 375, 444, 2369, 578, 3327, 2, 101, 2346, 116, 3, 24963, 368, 6175, 46, 404, 2, 2141, 2623, 228, 408, 3, 24963, 368, 16, 90, 23, 1030, 390, 20, 498, 411, 192, 122, 255, 7, 5, 913, 356, 2, 135, 5, 334, 356, 54, 68, 247, 29, 402, 632, 15, 617]",1668.0,17094024,529

Dietary carotenoids and risk of colorectal cancer in a pooled analysis of 11 cohort studies.,American journal of epidemiology,Am. J. Epidemiol.,2006-12-11,"Dietary carotenoids have been hypothesized to protect against epithelial cancers. The authors analyzed the associations between intakes of specific carotenoids (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lutein + zeaxanthin, and lycopene) and risk of colorectal cancer using the primary data from 11 cohort studies carried out in North America and Europe. Carotenoid intakes were estimated from food frequency questionnaires administered at baseline in each study. During 6-20 years of follow-up between 1980 and 2003, 7,885 incident cases of colorectal cancer were diagnosed among 702,647 participants. The authors calculated study-specific multivariate relative risks and then combined them using a random-effects model. In general, intakes of specific carotenoids were not associated with colorectal cancer risk.

A prospective pathologic analysis using whole-mount sections of rectal cancer following preoperative combined modality therapy: implications for sphincter preservation.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2007-01-01,"The aims of this study were to use a comprehensive whole-mount pathologic analysis to characterize microscopic patterns of residual disease, as well as circumferential and distal resection margins, in rectal cancer treated with preoperative CMT; and to identify clinicopathologic factors associated with residual disease. Recent studies have shown that preoperative combined modality therapy (CMT) for rectal cancer enhances rates of sphincter preservation. However, the efficacy of preoperative CMT in conjunction with a total mesorectal excision (TME)-based resection, in terms of resection margins using whole-mount sections, has not been reported. Furthermore, since patterns of residual disease and extent of distal spread following preoperative CMT are largely unknown, intraoperative determination of distal rectal transection remains a surgical challenge. We prospectively accrued 109 patients with endorectal ultrasound (ERUS)-staged, locally advanced rectal cancer (T2-T4 and/or N1), located a median distance of 7 cm from the anal verge, requiring preoperative CMT, and undergoing a TME-based resection. Comprehensive whole-mount pathologic analysis was performed, with particular emphasis on extent of residual disease, margin status, and intramural tumor extension. Clinicopathologic factors associated with residual disease were identified. A sphincter-preserving resection was feasible in 87 patients (80%), and in all 109 patients, distal margins were negative (median, 2.1 cm; range, 0.4-10 cm). Intramural extension beyond the gross mucosal edge of residual tumor was observed in only 2 patients (1.8%), both < or =0.95 cm. There were no positive circumferential margins (median, 10 mm; range, 1-28 mm), although 6 were less than or equal to 1 mm. On multivariate analysis, residual disease was observed more frequently in distally located tumors (distance from anal verge <5 cm) (P = 0.03). Our comprehensive pathologic analysis suggests that, following preoperative CMT and a TME-based resection, distal margins of 1 cm may provide for complete removal of locally advanced rectal cancer. Although residual cancer following preoperative CMT was more likely in the setting of distally located tumors, occult tumor beneath the mucosal edge was rare and, when present, limited to less than 1 cm. Our results extend the indications for sphincter preservation, as distal resection margins of only 1 cm may be acceptable for rectal cancer treated with preoperative CMT.",Journal Article,4768.0,98.0,The aims of this study were to use a comprehensive whole-mount pathologic analysis to characterize microscopic patterns of residual disease as well as circumferential and distal resection margins in cancer treated with preoperative CMT and to identify clinicopathologic factors associated with residual disease Recent studies have shown that preoperative combined modality therapy CMT for cancer enhances rates of sphincter preservation However the efficacy of preoperative CMT in conjunction with a total mesorectal excision TME -based resection in terms of resection margins using whole-mount sections has not been reported Furthermore since patterns of residual disease and extent of distal spread following preoperative CMT are largely unknown intraoperative determination of distal transection remains a surgical challenge We prospectively accrued 109 patients with endorectal ultrasound ERUS -staged locally advanced cancer T2-T4 and/or N1 located a median distance of 7 cm from the verge requiring preoperative CMT and undergoing a TME-based resection Comprehensive whole-mount pathologic analysis was performed with particular emphasis on extent of residual disease margin status and intramural tumor extension Clinicopathologic factors associated with residual disease were identified A sphincter-preserving resection was feasible in 87 patients 80 and in all 109 patients distal margins were negative median 2.1 cm range 0.4-10 cm Intramural extension beyond the gross mucosal edge of residual tumor was observed in only 2 patients 1.8 both or =0.95 cm There were no positive circumferential margins median 10 mm range 1-28 mm although 6 were less than or equal to 1 mm On multivariate analysis residual disease was observed more frequently in distally located tumors distance from verge 5 cm P 0.03 Our comprehensive pathologic analysis suggests that following preoperative CMT and a TME-based resection distal margins of 1 cm may provide for complete removal of locally advanced cancer Although residual cancer following preoperative CMT was more likely in the setting of distally located tumors occult tumor beneath the mucosal edge was rare and when present limited to less than 1 cm Our results extend the indications for sphincter preservation as distal resection margins of only 1 cm may be acceptable for cancer treated with preoperative CMT,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[3, 2970, 1, 26, 45, 11, 6, 119, 8, 949, 902, 9652, 510, 65, 6, 1507, 2984, 764, 1, 753, 34, 22, 149, 22, 7937, 2, 2107, 170, 1012, 4, 12, 73, 5, 498, 5380, 2, 6, 255, 1399, 130, 41, 5, 753, 34, 435, 94, 47, 443, 17, 498, 397, 1396, 36, 5380, 9, 12, 2519, 151, 1, 5400, 2224, 137, 3, 209, 1, 498, 5380, 4, 3357, 5, 8, 181, 5823, 1366, 5145, 90, 170, 4, 1794, 1, 170, 1012, 75, 902, 9652, 3013, 71, 44, 85, 210, 798, 1192, 764, 1, 753, 34, 2, 1039, 1, 2107, 2579, 366, 498, 5380, 32, 1733, 860, 1720, 3104, 1, 2107, 13575, 469, 8, 221, 1745, 21, 1143, 3198, 3486, 7, 5, 5615, 1945, 16345, 2930, 795, 131, 12, 1786, 2463, 2, 15, 3192, 2308, 8, 52, 3019, 1, 67, 494, 29, 3, 8330, 1888, 498, 5380, 2, 479, 8, 5145, 90, 170, 949, 902, 9652, 510, 65, 10, 173, 5, 1454, 3136, 23, 1039, 1, 753, 34, 959, 156, 2, 22056, 30, 2401, 1399, 130, 41, 5, 753, 34, 11, 108, 8, 5400, 4972, 170, 10, 1313, 4, 912, 7, 493, 2, 4, 62, 3486, 7, 2107, 1012, 11, 199, 52, 18, 14, 494, 184, 13, 39, 79, 494, 22056, 2401, 1654, 3, 1789, 3068, 7951, 1, 753, 30, 10, 164, 4, 158, 18, 7, 14, 66, 110, 15, 13, 48, 494, 125, 11, 77, 109, 7937, 1012, 52, 79, 321, 184, 14, 339, 321, 242, 49, 11, 299, 76, 15, 2997, 6, 14, 321, 23, 331, 65, 753, 34, 10, 164, 80, 746, 4, 17743, 2308, 57, 3019, 29, 8330, 33, 494, 19, 13, 680, 114, 949, 510, 65, 844, 17, 366, 498, 5380, 2, 8, 5145, 90, 170, 2107, 1012, 1, 14, 494, 68, 377, 9, 236, 2829, 1, 795, 131, 12, 242, 753, 12, 366, 498, 5380, 10, 80, 322, 4, 3, 546, 1, 17743, 2308, 57, 2879, 30, 17080, 3, 3068, 7951, 10, 622, 2, 198, 364, 383, 6, 299, 76, 14, 494, 114, 99, 4087, 3, 2406, 9, 5400, 2224, 22, 2107, 170, 1012, 1, 158, 14, 494, 68, 40, 1595, 9, 12, 73, 5, 498, 5380]",2359.0,17197970,348

Lymph node involvement is an important clinical prognostic factor affecting recurrence and survival. Few studies have explored molecular markers associated with lymph node involvement of rectal cancer. Tissue was obtained from 59 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who were treated with adjuvant chemoradiation therapy. We assessed messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of genes involved in pathways of angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], cyclooxygenase-2), apoptosis (survivin), tumor growth and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), DNA repair (ERCC1, Rad51), and the DNA synthesis in tumor tissue and tumor-adjacent normal tissue from paraffin-embedded samples using laser-capture microdissection methods. Twenty-four patients had no involvement of regional lymph nodes and 35 had lymph node metastases. In univariate analysis, patients with lymph node involvement had higher mRNA levels of VEGF and survivin in tumor tissue and EGFR in tumor-adjacent normal tissue compared with patients with no lymph node involvement (P < 0.1; t test). Multivariate analysis using recursive partitioning showed that mRNA levels of EGFR, survivin, and Rad51 are primarily responsible for delineating node positive from node negative.

Can differences in bowel function after surgery for rectal cancer be identified by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life instrument?,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2007-01-30,"Bowel function is an important outcome after rectal cancer surgery that affects quality of life (QOL). Postoperative bowel function is often assessed with QOL instruments, but their ability to detect functional differences has not been evaluated. This study evaluated the efficacy of the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core (C)-30 and Colorectal (CR)-38 QOL instruments in identifying functional differences among patients undergoing sphincter-preserving surgery, grouped by clinical and treatment-related factors known to be associated with bowel function. A total of 123 patients who underwent sphincter-preserving surgery for stage I to III rectal cancer completed the EORTC C-30 and CR-38 a median of 22.9 months after restoration of bowel continuity. The global QOL, Social and Physical Function subscales of the EORTC C-30, and Gastrointestinal (GI) Symptom and Defecation subscales of the EORTC CR-38 were hypothesized to be affected by bowel function. Known factors associated with function (age, sex, radiation, procedure, rectal reconstruction) were used to group patients. Differences in the QOL scores between patient groups were evaluated (t-test or analysis of variance). The global QOL was high, with a mean score of 76.84 +/- 18.6.

Carcinoid of the rectum risk stratification (CaRRs): a strategy for preoperative outcome assessment.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2007-02-09,"Predicting rectal carcinoid behavior based exclusively on tumor size is imprecise. We sought to identify factors associated with outcome and incorporate them into a pre-operative risk stratification scheme. Seventy rectal carcinoid patients evaluated at our institution were identified. Demographic, clinical, and histopathologic data were collected and correlated with recurrence and survival. The mean age of our cohort was 53.6 years. Fifty-seven percent of patients were female. The mean tumor size was 1.3 cm (range: 0.1-5 cm). Twenty-five percent of patients had deeply invasive tumors (into the muscularis propria or deeper); an equal percentage had tumors with lymphovascular invasion (LVI) or an elevated mitotic rate (> or =2/50 HPF). Eleven patients (17%) had distant metastases at presentation. Sixty-one patients were followed for a median of 22 months (2-308 months), during which seven patients developed recurrence and seven died of disease (2/7 who developed recurrence). Poor outcome was associated with large tumor size, deep invasion, presence of LVI, and elevated mitotic rate. These factors were incorporated into a carcinoid of the rectum risk stratification (CaRRS) score. CaRRS predicted recurrence-free and disease-specific survival better than any single factor alone. Poor prognostic features of rectal carcinoids include: large size, deep invasion, LVI, and elevated mitotic rate. The CaRRS score incorporates these features and accurately predicts outcome. Because the CaRRS score is based upon values available on pre-operative biopsy, it can identify patients with very favorable prognosis as well as those with poor prognosis that may benefit from additional staging or surveillance.",Journal Article,4729.0,40.0,Predicting behavior based exclusively on tumor size is imprecise We sought to identify factors associated with outcome and incorporate them into a pre-operative risk stratification scheme Seventy patients evaluated at our institution were identified Demographic clinical and histopathologic data were collected and correlated with recurrence and survival The mean age of our cohort was 53.6 years Fifty-seven percent of patients were female The mean tumor size was 1.3 cm range 0.1-5 cm Twenty-five percent of patients had deeply invasive tumors into the muscularis propria or deeper an equal percentage had tumors with lymphovascular invasion LVI or an elevated mitotic rate or =2/50 HPF Eleven patients 17 had distant metastases at presentation Sixty-one patients were followed for a median of 22 months 2-308 months during which seven patients developed recurrence and seven died of disease 2/7 who developed recurrence Poor outcome was associated with large tumor size deep invasion presence of LVI and elevated mitotic rate These factors were incorporated into a of the rectum risk stratification CaRRS score CaRRS predicted recurrence-free and disease-specific survival better than any single factor alone Poor prognostic features of carcinoids include large size deep invasion LVI and elevated mitotic rate The CaRRS score incorporates these features and accurately predicts outcome Because the CaRRS score is based upon values available on pre-operative biopsy it can identify patients with very favorable prognosis as well as those with poor prognosis that may benefit from additional staging or surveillance,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[1434, 1710, 90, 4437, 23, 30, 444, 16, 18486, 21, 990, 6, 255, 130, 41, 5, 228, 2, 3360, 1370, 237, 8, 671, 1208, 43, 1541, 4633, 2073, 7, 194, 28, 114, 731, 11, 108, 1540, 38, 2, 2630, 74, 11, 786, 2, 438, 5, 146, 2, 25, 3, 313, 89, 1, 114, 180, 10, 699, 49, 60, 1461, 648, 714, 1, 7, 11, 1061, 3, 313, 30, 444, 10, 14, 27, 494, 184, 13, 14, 33, 494, 737, 365, 714, 1, 7, 42, 16394, 416, 57, 237, 3, 13936, 10859, 15, 6029, 35, 2997, 1150, 42, 57, 5, 2933, 578, 3327, 15, 35, 804, 2346, 116, 15, 18, 212, 10457, 2627, 7, 269, 42, 626, 196, 28, 1031, 1746, 104, 7, 11, 370, 9, 8, 52, 1, 350, 53, 18, 7786, 53, 190, 92, 648, 7, 276, 146, 2, 648, 1016, 1, 34, 18, 67, 54, 276, 146, 334, 228, 10, 41, 5, 375, 30, 444, 2369, 578, 463, 1, 3327, 2, 804, 2346, 116, 46, 130, 11, 2449, 237, 8, 1, 3, 3660, 43, 1541, 24963, 368, 24963, 783, 146, 115, 2, 34, 112, 25, 380, 76, 500, 226, 161, 279, 334, 177, 404, 1, 9878, 643, 375, 444, 2369, 578, 3327, 2, 804, 2346, 116, 3, 24963, 368, 6175, 46, 404, 2, 2141, 2623, 228, 408, 3, 24963, 368, 16, 90, 1548, 1030, 390, 23, 671, 1208, 411, 192, 122, 255, 7, 5, 923, 913, 356, 22, 149, 22, 135, 5, 334, 356, 17, 68, 247, 29, 402, 632, 15, 617]",1617.0,17294074,622
Toxicities and survival among octogenarians and nonagenarians with colorectal cancer treated with chemotherapy or concurrent chemoradiation therapy.,Clinical colorectal cancer,Clin Colorectal Cancer,2007-01-01,"Patients aged > or = 70 years with colon cancer benefit from chemotherapy, with no major added toxicities compared with a younger population. However, the safety and efficacy of chemotherapy or chemoradiation therapy in octogenarians and nonagenarians with colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been previously reported. We conducted a retrospective study of the safety and efficacy of chemotherapy or chemoradiation therapy in patients with CRC treated between January 2002 and June 2006 at Roswell Park Cancer Institute. Thirty-three patients were identified, 24 of whom had colon cancer and 9 of whom had rectal cancer. Twenty-two patients with metastatic colon cancer and 8 patients with rectal cancer were evaluable for toxicity. All patients were started on an attenuated regimen of chemotherapy. A high rate of severe diarrhea (46%) and treatment-related hospitalizations (73%) were noted among patients with metastatic colon cancer. Toxicities were managed by treatment interruptions. The median overall survival among the metastatic colon cancer cohort was 20.6 months (95% confidence interval, 11.1-26.4 months). Among the patients with rectal cancer, 5 had locally advanced disease and were treated with chemoradiation therapy. Chemotherapy was interrupted in 3 of 5 patients because of toxicity. Radiation therapy was discontinued because of toxicity in 1 of 5 patients. Our results suggest the susceptibility of patients with CRC aged > or = 80 years to chemotherapy toxicity.

Predictors of overall and cancer-free survival of patients with localized prostate cancer treated with primary androgen suppression therapy: results from the prostate cancer outcomes study.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2007-04-01,"Primary androgen suppression therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer is increasingly common in the United States despite a lack of supportive evidence for its use. We determined which demographic and clinical factors predict overall and cancer specific survival with this treatment strategy in patients enrolled in the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study. In 1994 to 1995 the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study recruited 3,533 men diagnosed with prostate cancer. Clinical and treatment information was abstracted from medical records and demographic characteristics were obtained from patient surveys 6, 12, 24 and 60 months after diagnosis. Overall and cancer specific mortality was analyzed through December 2002 using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression. A total of 276 patients had organ confined (cT1-2) prostatic adenocarcinoma and received primary androgen suppression therapy within 1 year of diagnosis. Median followup for censored patients was 7.6 years (range 1.1 to 8.1). Five-year overall and cancer specific survival was 66% (95% CI 59-72) and 91% (95% CI 86-94), respectively. Independent predictors of shorter overall survival were patient age 75 years or older, prostate specific antigen 20 ng/ml or greater, Gleason score 7 or greater and abnormal digital rectal examination. Gleason score 7 or greater, prostate specific antigen 20 ng/ml or greater and a low comorbidity index were independent predictors of shorter cancer specific survival.

Predictors of tumor response and downstaging in patients who receive preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2007-05-01,"The objective of this study was to identify predictive factors for pathologic complete response and tumor downstaging after preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer. Between 1989 and 2004, 562 patients with nonmetastatic rectal adenocarcinoma received preoperative chemoradiation and underwent mesorectal excision. The median radiation dose was 45 Gray (Gy) (range, 19.8-58.6 Gy), 77% of patients received concurrent infusional 5-fluorouracil, 20% of patients received concurrent capecitabine, and 3% of patients received other regimens. Nineteen percent of patients achieved a pathologic complete response (CR), whereas 20% of patients had only microscopic residual disease at surgery, and 61% of patients had macroscopic residual disease at surgery. Downstaging of the tumor stage occurred in 57% of patients. The results from a univariate analysis indicated that tumor circumferential extent>60% (P=.033) and pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level>2.5 ng/mL (P=.015) were associated significantly with lower pathologic CR rates. The univariate analysis also indicated that tumor circumferential extent>60% (P=.001), pretreatment CEA level>2.5 ng/mL (P=.006), and distance from the anal verge>5 cm (P=.035) were associated significantly with lower downstaging rates. The results from a multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that greater circumferential extent of tumor (odds ratio [OR], 0.43; P=.033) independently predicted a lower pathologic CR rate. The multivariate logistic regression analysis also indicated that greater circumferential extent of tumor (OR, 0.49; P=.020) and greater distance from the anal verge (OR, 0.46; P=.010) independently predicted a lower downstaging rate. Circumferential extent of tumor, CEA level, and distance from the anal verge predicted for the pathologic response to preoperative chemoradiation for patients with rectal cancer.

A special study then analyzed perioperative outcomes, local recurrence and survival in 2124 patients diagnosed between 1994 and 1996, including 765 (T1, 601; T2, 164) treated by LE and 1359 (T1, 493; T2, 866) treated by SR. From 1989 to 2003, the use of LE has increased (T1, 26.6-43.7%; T2, 5.8-16.8%; P < 0.001 both). The special study demonstrated significantly lower 30-day morbidity after LE versus SR (5.6% vs. 14.6%; P < 0.001). After adjusting for patient and tumor characteristics, the 5-year local recurrence after LE versus SR was 12.5 versus 6.9% (P = 0.003; hazard ratio = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.23-0.62) for T1 tumors, and 22.1 versus 15.1% (P = 0.01; hazard ratio = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.44-1.07) for T2 tumors. The 5-year overall survival (T1, 77.4% vs. 81.7%, P = 0.09; T2, 67.6% vs. 76.5%, P = 0.01) was influenced by age and comorbidities but not the type of surgery.

Viability of endoscopic and excisional treatment of early rectal carcinoids.,Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,J. Gastrointest. Surg.,2007-07-01,"With the advent of endoscopy, the incidence of rectal carcinoid tumors has not only risen, but the majority are localized at presentation. This has led to excisional and/or ablative therapy in lieu of radical resections. A single institute's experience with rectal carcinoids was reviewed to determine the impact this approach has had on outcomes, and evaluate any selection criteria for optimizing patient survival. A single institute's tumor registry was retrospectively queried, identifying 14 patients with rectal carcinoid tumors over a 28-year period. The mean age at diagnosis was 52.1 +/- 14.4 years. Six of the 14 patients were female. Presenting symptoms included a change in bowel habits in six (38%), rectal bleeding in six (38%), and abdominal pain or distention in five (31%) patients. No patient had symptoms consistent with carcinoid syndrome. The rectal carcinoids were a mean 9.2 +/- 3.4 cm from the anal verge and a mean 9 +/- 6 mm in size. Endoscopic and/or transanal excision/fulguration techniques treated 11 (79%) patients, whereas two (14%) patients underwent a low anterior resection (LAR).

Assessment of prostate-specific antigen doubling time in prediction of prostate cancer on needle biopsy.,Urology,Urology,2007-05-01,"Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics have failed to predict for the presence of prostate cancer in screening populations in which many patients harbor subclinical disease. We hypothesized that the prebiopsy PSA doubling time (PSADT) and PSA velocity (PSAV) could predict for cancer detection in a referral population with a suspicion of prostate cancer. Data were collected from 1699 consecutive veterans with a PSA level of 10 ng/mL or less who underwent prostate biopsy. Logistic regression analysis was performed on the following: age, race, family history, digital rectal examination findings, PSA, PSA density, PSADT, PSAV, prostate volume, and ultrasound lesions. Model building was accomplished with 70% of the data, and validation was done using the remaining 30%. These data were also analyzed using classification and regression tree analysis. Using logistic regression analysis (P <0.05) on the model building set, prostate cancer was associated with age (older than 70 years), PSA level (greater than 2.9 ng/mL), PSA density (more than 0.12 ng/mL/cm3), digital rectal examination findings, and the presence of a lesion on ultrasonography. A PSADT of 2 to 5 years was marginally associated with prostate cancer detection (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.3), and a PSADT of less than 2 years or longer than 5 years and PSAV were not predictive. On classification and regression tree analysis, PSADT was not selected as a predictive factor. Furthermore, neither PSADT nor PSAV was predictive of Gleason score 7 or worse cancer. In contrast to its prognostic value after the diagnosis of prostate cancer has been established, PSA kinetics offer little to clinical decision making as predictors of cancer or high-grade cancer in men with a PSA level of 10 ng/mL or less.",Journal Article,4648.0,11.0,Prostate-specific antigen PSA kinetics have failed to predict for the presence of cancer in screening populations in which many patients harbor subclinical disease We hypothesized that the prebiopsy PSA doubling time PSADT and PSA velocity PSAV could predict for cancer detection in a referral population with a suspicion of cancer Data were collected from 1699 consecutive veterans with a PSA level of 10 ng/mL or less who underwent biopsy Logistic regression analysis was performed on the following age race family history digital examination findings PSA PSA density PSADT PSAV volume and ultrasound lesions Model building was accomplished with 70 of the data and validation was done using the remaining 30 These data were also analyzed using classification and regression tree analysis Using logistic regression analysis P 0.05 on the model building set cancer was associated with age older than 70 years PSA level greater than 2.9 ng/mL PSA density more than 0.12 ng/mL/cm3 digital examination findings and the presence of a lesion on ultrasonography A PSADT of 2 to 5 years was marginally associated with cancer detection odds ratio 1.6 95 confidence interval 1.1 to 2.3 and a PSADT of less than 2 years or longer than 5 years and PSAV were not predictive On classification and regression tree analysis PSADT was not selected as a predictive factor Furthermore neither PSADT nor PSAV was predictive of Gleason score 7 or worse cancer In contrast to its prognostic value after the diagnosis of cancer has been established PSA kinetics offer little to clinical decision making as predictors of cancer or high-grade cancer in men with a PSA level of 10 ng/mL or less,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[1364, 112, 448, 534, 3839, 47, 1551, 6, 678, 9, 3, 463, 1, 12, 4, 453, 1184, 4, 92, 445, 7, 2760, 7403, 34, 21, 1237, 17, 3, 26216, 534, 4342, 98, 6583, 2, 534, 6025, 8891, 359, 678, 9, 12, 638, 4, 8, 2096, 266, 5, 8, 5782, 1, 12, 74, 11, 786, 29, 44709, 935, 7707, 5, 8, 534, 301, 1, 79, 997, 542, 15, 299, 54, 208, 411, 812, 320, 65, 10, 173, 23, 3, 366, 89, 1047, 607, 532, 3271, 1385, 272, 534, 534, 1263, 6583, 8891, 433, 2, 1945, 406, 202, 5808, 10, 5741, 5, 431, 1, 3, 74, 2, 929, 10, 1822, 75, 3, 1844, 201, 46, 74, 11, 120, 311, 75, 947, 2, 320, 4899, 65, 75, 812, 320, 65, 19, 13, 474, 23, 3, 202, 5808, 916, 12, 10, 41, 5, 89, 434, 76, 431, 60, 534, 301, 378, 76, 18, 83, 997, 542, 534, 1263, 80, 76, 13, 133, 997, 542, 7397, 3271, 1385, 272, 2, 3, 463, 1, 8, 1180, 23, 4244, 8, 6583, 1, 18, 6, 33, 60, 10, 5007, 41, 5, 12, 638, 610, 197, 14, 49, 48, 307, 268, 14, 14, 6, 18, 27, 2, 8, 6583, 1, 299, 76, 18, 60, 15, 589, 76, 33, 60, 2, 8891, 11, 44, 464, 23, 947, 2, 320, 4899, 65, 6583, 10, 44, 715, 22, 8, 464, 161, 798, 2174, 6583, 2110, 8891, 10, 464, 1, 1406, 368, 67, 15, 639, 12, 4, 748, 6, 211, 177, 549, 50, 3, 147, 1, 12, 71, 85, 635, 534, 3839, 1918, 1215, 6, 38, 948, 1079, 22, 674, 1, 12, 15, 64, 88, 12, 4, 325, 5, 8, 534, 301, 1, 79, 997, 542, 15, 299]",1669.0,17482937,235

Approximately three quarters of patients are diagnosed with disease limited to the bowel wall or surrounding lymph nodes. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in the treatment of localized colorectal cancer due to advances in surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. For patients with Stage III colon cancer, an overall survival benefit for fluorouracil-based chemotherapy has been firmly established, and recent data have shown further efficacy through the inclusion of oxaliplatin into adjuvant treatment programs. For patients with Stage II colon cancer, the use of adjuvant chemotherapy remains controversial, but may be appropriate in a subset of individuals at high risk for disease recurrence. In the treatment of patients with rectal cancer, improved outcomes have been noted with the use of total mesorectal excision and preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

Radiotherapy treatment of early-stage prostate cancer with IMRT and protons: a treatment planning comparison.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2007-05-21,"To compare intensity-modulated photon radiotherapy (IMRT) with three-dimensional conformal proton therapy (3D-CPT) for early-stage prostate cancer, and explore the potential utility of intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT). Ten patients were planned with both 3D-CPT (two parallel-opposed lateral fields) and IMRT (seven equally spaced coplanar fields). Prescribed dose was 79.2 Gy (or cobalt Gray-equivalent, [CGE] for protons) to the prostate gland. Dose-volume histograms, dose conformity, and equivalent uniform dose (EUD) were compared. Additionally, plans were optimized for 3D-CPT with nonstandard beam configuration, and for IMPT assuming delivery with beam scanning. At least 98% of the planning target volume received the prescription dose. IMRT plans yielded better dose conformity to the target, whereas proton plans achieved higher dose homogeneity and better sparing of rectum and bladder in the range below 30 Gy/CGE. Bladder volumes receiving more than 70 Gy/CGE (V70) were reduced, on average, by 34% with IMRT vs. 3D-CPT, whereas rectal V70 were equivalent. EUD from 3D-CPT and IMRT plans were indistinguishable within uncertainties for both bladder and rectum.

Capecitabine-induced headache responding to diltiazem.,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,2007-05-25,"Headaches have been reported as a potential side effect of capecitabine therapy. However, severe limiting headaches are rarely experienced in this setting and no known therapy has been described for such a serious side effect. We report the case of a patient treated with capecitabine and radiation for rectal adenocarcinoma. The patient developed grade 3 capecitabine-induced headache. A cause-effect relationship to capecitabine was suggested due to resolution of headache with capecitabine withdrawal and reappearance with capecitabine rechallenge. The patient's headache resolved with diltiazem therapy and she was able to complete capecitabine and radiation therapy without further adverse events. Capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) are known vasospasm inducers. We hypothesize that capecitabine-induced headache is vascular in nature. This likely explains the noted response to a calcium channel blocker (CCB), namely diltiazem.

A nested case control study of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and risk of colorectal cancer.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2007-07-10,"Low vitamin D status has long been implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis. We investigated this relationship in a nested case-control study within the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), a large ongoing study of male health professionals living in the United States. Between 1993 and 2002, 179 colorectal cancer patients were diagnosed and matched to 356 control subjects by age and by month and year of blood collection. Results were also pooled with previously published results from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) cohort, a large female cohort. Conditional logistic regression was used to analyze the association between plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and colorectal cancer, and pooled estimates were calculated using the method of DerSimonian and Laird. All statistical tests were two-sided. In the HPFS, we observed a non-statistically significant inverse association between higher plasma 25(OH)D concentration and risk of colorectal cancer and a statistically significant inverse association for colon cancer (highest versus lowest quintile: odds ratio [OR] = 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.24 to 0.89; P(trend) = .005). After pooling the results from the HPFS and NHS, higher plasma 25(OH)D concentrations were statistically significantly associated with decreased risks of both colorectal cancer (highest versus lowest quintile, OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.42 to 1.05; P(trend) = .01) and colon cancer (highest versus lowest quintile, OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.34 to 0.86; P(trend) = .002). Inverse associations with plasma 25(OH)D concentration did not differ by location of colon cancer (proximal versus distal), but the number of patients was small and none of the associations was statistically significant. Opposite relationships between plasma 25(OH)D levels and risk of rectal cancers were found among men (positive) and women (inverse).

Colon Rectum,2007-09-01,"This study was designed to evaluate one institution's experience with treatment outcomes for rectal squamous-cell carcinoma. Using our prospective Colorectal Database, we identified patients diagnosed with rectal squamous-cell carcinoma at our institution between 1983 and 2005. Pathology was rereviewed, tumor immunophenotype was compared to control cases of anal squamous-cell carcinoma and rectal adenocarcinoma, treatment modalities and outcomes were analyzed. Twelve patients were identified (10 females median age, 58 years). Median distal extent of tumors was 7 (range, 5-8) cm from the anal verge. Treatment included chemotherapy only (n = 1), chemoradiation only (n = 2), induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation and surgery (n = 2), chemoradiation followed by surgery (n = 5), and surgery followed by chemoradiation (n = 2). The chemotherapy regimen was 5-fluorouracil-based. Radiotherapy total dose was 50.4 Gy (1.8 Gy/day, daily x 5) external iliac and inguinal nodes were not included in the radiation field. Complete clinical responders to chemoradiation (n = 2) received no further treatment. All seven partial responders underwent surgery; six had complete pathologic response; nodal status in two of six was unknown because they had local excision. Immunophenotypical analysis showed similar keratin expression profile between rectal squamous-cell carcinoma (n = 5) and rectal adenocarcinoma (n = 5), which is different from anal squamous-cell carcinoma (n = 10). All patients were alive without evidence of disease at follow-up (median follow-up, 2.6 (range, 0.5-16) years). Our data suggest that most patients treated with upfront chemoradiation therapy followed by surgery did well. Sphincter-preserving surgery is usually feasible.

Are we undertreating rectal cancer in the elderly? An epidemiologic study.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2007-08-01,"To better understand the reasons for decreased survival rates in elderly patients with rectal cancer by performing an epidemiologic evaluation of age-related differences in treatment and survival. The incidence of rectal cancer increases with older age, and localized disease can be curatively treated with stage-appropriate radical surgery. However, older patients have been noted to experience decreased survival. Patients with localized rectal adenocarcinoma were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (1991-2002). Cancer-specific survival by age, sex, surgery type, tumor grade, lymph node status, and use of radiation therapy was evaluated using univariate and multivariate regression analysis. We identified 21,390 patients who met the selection criteria. The median age was 68 years. Each half-decade increase in age > or =70 years was associated with a 37% increase in the relative risk (RR) for cancer-related mortality (RR = 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-1.42); decreased receipt of cancer-directed surgery (odds ratio [OR] = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.36-0.63); more local excision and less radical surgery (OR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.72-0.81); less radiotherapy (OR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.61-0.67); and greater likelihood of N0 pathologic stage classification (OR = 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.15) (P < 0.0001 for each factor). The effect of age on cancer-specific mortality persisted in multivariate analysis with each half-decade increase in age > or =70 years resulting in a 31% increase in cancer-specific mortality (RR = 1.31; 95% CI, 1.25-1.36; P < 0.0001).

Limitations of early rectal cancer nodal staging may explain failure after local excision.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2007-10-01,"Successful selection of patients with rectal cancer for local excision requires accurate preoperative lymph node staging. Although endorectal ultrasound is capable of detecting locally advanced disease, its ability to correctly identify nodal metastases in early rectal lesions is less well described. This study examines the accuracy of endorectal ultrasound in determining nodal stage based on depth of penetration of the primary lesion (T stage). Between 1998 and 2003, endorectal ultrasound was performed on 938 consecutive patients; 134 had biopsy-proven rectal cancers and were treated with radical resection, without neoadjuvant therapy. Lymph node metastases were measured pathologically and correlated with endorectal ultrasound and clinicopathologic features. Accuracy and specificity of endorectal ultrasound nodal staging was determined. The overall accuracy of endorectal ultrasound nodal staging for the study cohort was 70 percent, with a 16 percent false-positive rate and 14 percent false-negative rate. Endorectal ultrasound was more likely to overlook small metastatic lymph node deposits. The size of lymph node metastasis and accuracy of endorectal ultrasound nodal staging was related to T stage. The specificity of endorectal ultrasound nodal staging, or the ability to identify patients who were node-negative, was dependent on T stage. Early rectal lesions are more likely to have lymph node micrometastases not detected by endorectal ultrasound.

Retrospective dosimetric comparison of low-dose-rate and pulsed-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy using a tandem and mini-ovoids.,Medical dosimetry : official journal of the American Association of Medical Dosimetrists,Med Dosim,2007-01-01,"The purpose of this study was to compare the dose distribution of Iridium-192 ((192)Ir) pulsed-dose-rate (PDR) brachytherapy to that of Cesium-137 ((137)Cs) low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy around mini-ovoids and an intrauterine tandem. Ten patient treatment plans were selected from our clinical database, all of which used mini-ovoids and an intrauterine tandem. A commercial treatment planning system using AAPM TG43 formalism was used to calculate the dose in water for both the (137)Cs and (192)Ir sources. For equivalent system loadings, we compared the dose distributions in relevant clinical planes, points A and B, and to the ICRU bladder and rectal reference points. The mean PDR doses to points A and B were 3% +/- 1% and 6% +/- 1% higher than the LDR doses, respectively. For the rectum point, the PDR dose was 4% +/- 3% lower than the LDR dose, mainly because of the (192)Ir PDR source anisotropy. For the bladder point, the PDR dose was 1% +/- 4% higher than the LDR dose. We conclude that the PDR and LDR dose distributions are equivalent for intracavitary brachytherapy with a tandem and mini-ovoids.

How adequate is digital rectal exam for prostate cancer screening at colonoscopy? Can adequacy be improved?,Digestive diseases and sciences,Dig. Dis. Sci.,2007-08-21,"Screening by digital rectal exam (DRE) has been advocated as a means of detecting early-stage prostate cancer. We sought to determine the adequacy of prostate palpation at DRE at colonoscopy, and to devise a method of improving adequacy when the gland is incompletely felt. Adequacy of prostate palpation in the left lateral position was prospectively assessed in 200 males 40 years or older undergoing colonoscopy, and correlated with body mass index (BMI) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) weight categories. If the prostate was incompletely felt, the patient was asked to flex his knee(s) up toward his chest, and then the exam was repeated. The prostate was incompletely felt on initial DRE in 65 of 200 patients (32.5%). Raising the knee(s) toward the chest permitted complete palpation in 62 of those 65 cases. Incomplete palpation showed a strong correlation with BMI (P < 0.0001) and weight category: 3/36 (8.3%) for patients with normal body weight, 14/89 (15.7%) for overweight, 42/68 (61.8%) for obesity, and 6/7 (85.7%) for extreme obesity (P < 0.0001). There were 13 patients in whom no part of the prostate gland could be felt on the initial DRE, and which also correlated with NIH weight class (P < 0.0001).

Positron emission tomography detection of distant metastatic or synchronous disease in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer receiving preoperative chemoradiation.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2007-09-20,"Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer may present with synchronous distant metastases. Choice of optimal treatment--neoadjuvant chemoradiation versus systemic chemotherapy alone--depends on accurate assessment of distant disease. We prospectively evaluated the ability of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) to detect distant disease in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who were otherwise eligible for combined modality therapy (CMT). Ninety-three patients with locally advanced rectal cancer underwent whole-body [18F]FDG PET scanning 2-3 weeks before starting CMT. Sites other than the rectum, mesorectum, or the area along the inferior mesenteric artery were considered distant and were divided into nine groups: neck, lung, mediastinal lymph node (LN), abdomen, liver, colon, pelvis, peripheral LN, and soft tissue. Two nuclear medicine physicians blinded to clinical information used PET images and a five-point scale (0-4) to determine certainty of disease. A score greater than 3 was considered malignant. Confirmation was based on tissue diagnosis, surgical exploration, and subsequent imaging. At a median follow-up of 34 months, the overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of PET in detecting distant disease were 93.7%, 77.8%, and 98.7% respectively. Greatest accuracy was demonstrated in detection of liver (accuracy = 99.9%, sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 98.8%) and lung (accuracy = 99.9%, sensitivity = 80%, specificity = 100%) disease; PET detected 11/12 confirmed malignant sites in liver and lung.

Prognostic factors affecting locally recurrent rectal cancer and clinical significance of hemoglobin.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2007-09-24,"To investigate potential prognostic factors, including hemoglobin levels before and during radiotherapy, for associations with survival and local control in patients with unirradiated locally recurrent rectal cancer. Ten potential prognostic factors were investigated in 94 patients receiving radiotherapy for recurrent rectal cancer: age (<or=68 vs. >or=69 years), gender, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0-1 vs. 2-3), American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage (<or=II vs. III vs. IV), grading (G1-2 vs. G3), surgery, administration of chemotherapy, radiation dose (equivalent dose in 2-Gy fractions: <or=50 vs. >50 Gy), and hemoglobin levels before (<12 vs. >or=12 g/dL) and during (majority of levels: <12 vs. >or=12 g/dL) radiotherapy. Multivariate analyses were performed, including hemoglobin levels, either before or during radiotherapy (not both) because these are confounding variables. Improved survival was associated with better performance status (p<0.001), lower AJCC stage (p=0.023), surgery (p=0.011), chemotherapy (p=0.003), and hemoglobin levels>or=12 g/dL both before (p=0.031) and during (p<0.001) radiotherapy. On multivariate analyses, performance status, AJCC stage, and hemoglobin levels during radiotherapy maintained significance. Improved local control was associated with better performance status (p=0.040), lower AJCC stage (p=0.010), lower grading (p=0.012), surgery (p<0.001), chemotherapy (p<0.001), and hemoglobin levels>or=12 g/dL before (p<0.001) and during (p<0.001) radiotherapy. On multivariate analyses, chemotherapy, grading, and hemoglobin levels before and during radiotherapy remained significant. Subgroup analyses of the patients having surgery demonstrated the extent of resection to be significantly associated with local control (p=0.011) but not with survival (p=0.45).

Prognostic impact of micrometastases in colon cancer: interim results of a prospective multicenter trial.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2007-10-01,"The 25% rate of recurrence after complete resection of stage II colon cancer (CC) suggests the presence of occult nodal metastases not identified by hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E). Interim data from our ongoing prospective multicenter trial of sentinel node (SN) biopsy indicate a 29.6% rate of micrometastases (MM) identified by immunohistochemical staining (IHC) of H&E-negative SNs in CC. We hypothesized that these MM have prognostic importance. Between March 2001 and August 2006, 152 patients with resectable colorectal cancer were enrolled in the trial. IHC and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT) assay were performed on H&E-negative SNs. Results were correlated with disease-free survival. The sensitivity of lymphatic mapping was significantly better in CC (75%) than rectal cancer (36%), P<0.05. Of 92 node-negative CC patients 7 (8%) were upstaged to N1 and 18 (22%) had IHC MM. Four patients negative by H&E and IHC were positive by qRT. At a mean follow-up of 25 months, 15 patients had died from noncancer-related causes, 12 had developed recurrence, 5 had died of CC (2 with macrometastases, 3 with MM), and 7 were alive with disease. The 12 recurrences included 4 patients with SN macrometastases and 6 with SN MM (2 by IHC, 4 by qRT). One of the 2 SN-negative recurrences had other positive lymph nodes by H&E. All patients with CC recurrences had a positive SN by either H&E/IHC or qRT. No CC patient with a negative SN by H&E and qRT has recurred (P=0.002). This is the first prospective evaluation of the prognostic impact of MM in colorectal cancer. These results indicate that the detection of MM may be clinically relevant in CC and may improve the selection of patients for adjuvant systemic chemotherapy.

"Polyamine catabolism in colorectal cancer cells following treatment with oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and N1, N11 diethylnorspermine.",Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol.,2007-11-07,"Our previous studies showed that combined treatment of oxaliplatin and N(1), N(11) diethyl-norspermine (DENSPM) results in massive induction of spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase (SSAT) mRNA and activity. Since oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) are used clinically in treatment of colorectal cancers, this study examines the effect of adding DENSPM to oxaliplatin/5FU combination on SSAT and spermine oxidase (SMO) in HCT-116 cells. HCT-116 cells were treated with clinically relevant concentrations of drugs for 20 h followed by 24 h in drug free medium. SSAT and SMO mRNA and protein were assayed by QRT-PCR and Westerns respectively; polyamine pools were measured by HPLC. SSAT and SMO mRNA in tumor biopsies from patients with rectal cancer receiving oxaliplatin, capecitabine and radiation were measured by QRT-PCR. Oxaliplatin + 5FU + DENSPM produced significantly higher levels of SSAT and SMO mRNA, protein and activity than those seen with oxaliplatin+5FU with a significant depletion of cellular spermine and spermidine pools. Oxaliplatin/DENSPM was superior to 5FU/DENSPM in SSAT induction but similar for SMO. Oxaliplatin + DENSPM revealed synergistic growth inhibition at >IC(50) concentrations and antagonism at <IC(50). SMO and SSAT induction occurred in 60 and 30% of the patient samples examined.

Safety and efficacy of first-line chemotherapy in unresected metastatic colorectal cancer.,Clinical colorectal cancer,Clin Colorectal Cancer,2007-11-01,"Primary tumor resection in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer is considered highly controversial. Historical data suggest a low risk of primary tumor-related complications in patients treated with first-line 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy. However, there are very limited data on the safety and efficacy of first-line combination chemotherapy in this unresected-primary population, especially in the setting of rectal cancer. We performed a single-institution retrospective study to evaluate the primary tumor-related complication rate and outcome of patients with unresected metastatic colorectal cancer treated with first-line chemotherapy. Estimation of the overall and progression-free survival distributions were done using the Kaplan-Meier method. Thirty-eight patients were identified: 26 had primary colon cancers and 12 had primary rectal cancers. Thirty-one patients were treated with first-line FOLFOX (oxaliplatin/leucovorin/5-FU) with or without bevacizumab. In patients with colon tumors, only 2 (7%) required surgery, both for obstruction. In patients with rectal tumors, 3 (25%) developed progressive obstructive symptoms, and 2 developed worsening pain. Four of these patients were adequately palliated with chemoradiation; only 1 patient required a diverting colostomy. The median progression-free survival was 7 months, and overall survival was 17.3 months. Twenty-two patients died because of disease progression, only 3 of whom developed obstructive symptoms at the primary tumor site before death. First-line chemotherapy is feasible and safe in patients with unresected colon and nonirradiated rectal cancer. The rate of bowel obstruction requiring surgical intervention in this population was < 10%. These results support an approach that defers surgery in non-obstructed, noncurable patients in favor of systemic chemotherapy as initial treatment.",Journal Article,4464.0,,Primary tumor resection in patients with metastatic cancer is considered highly controversial Historical data suggest a low risk of primary tumor-related complications in patients treated with first-line 5-fluorouracil 5-FU chemotherapy However there are very limited data on the safety and efficacy of first-line combination chemotherapy in this unresected-primary population especially in the setting of cancer We performed a single-institution retrospective study to evaluate the primary tumor-related complication rate and outcome of patients with unresected metastatic cancer treated with first-line chemotherapy Estimation of the overall and progression-free survival distributions were done using the Kaplan-Meier method Thirty-eight patients were identified 26 had primary cancers and 12 had primary cancers Thirty-one patients were treated with first-line FOLFOX oxaliplatin/leucovorin/5-FU with or without bevacizumab In patients with tumors only 2 7 required surgery both for obstruction In patients with tumors 3 25 developed progressive obstructive symptoms and 2 developed worsening pain Four of these patients were adequately palliated with chemoradiation only 1 patient required a diverting colostomy The median progression-free survival was 7 months and overall survival was 17.3 months Twenty-two patients died because of disease progression only 3 of whom developed obstructive symptoms at the primary tumor site before death First-line chemotherapy is feasible and safe in patients with unresected and nonirradiated cancer The rate of bowel obstruction requiring surgical intervention in this population was 10 These results support an approach that defers surgery in non-obstructed noncurable patients in favor of systemic chemotherapy as initial treatment,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[86, 30, 170, 4, 7, 5, 113, 12, 16, 515, 561, 2010, 2252, 74, 309, 8, 154, 43, 1, 86, 30, 139, 521, 4, 7, 73, 5, 157, 328, 33, 1404, 33, 1296, 56, 137, 125, 32, 923, 383, 74, 23, 3, 367, 2, 209, 1, 157, 328, 150, 56, 4, 26, 8096, 86, 266, 1093, 4, 3, 546, 1, 12, 21, 173, 8, 226, 731, 459, 45, 6, 376, 3, 86, 30, 139, 1447, 116, 2, 228, 1, 7, 5, 8096, 113, 12, 73, 5, 157, 328, 56, 4470, 1, 3, 63, 2, 91, 115, 25, 4477, 11, 1822, 75, 3, 876, 882, 596, 977, 659, 7, 11, 108, 432, 42, 86, 163, 2, 133, 42, 86, 163, 977, 104, 7, 11, 73, 5, 157, 328, 3777, 1476, 3296, 33, 1296, 5, 15, 187, 599, 4, 7, 5, 57, 158, 18, 67, 616, 152, 110, 9, 3191, 4, 7, 5, 57, 27, 243, 276, 1014, 6937, 507, 2, 18, 276, 4323, 559, 294, 1, 46, 7, 11, 4215, 26054, 5, 975, 158, 14, 69, 616, 8, 15107, 7635, 3, 52, 91, 115, 25, 10, 67, 53, 2, 63, 25, 10, 269, 27, 53, 737, 100, 7, 1016, 408, 1, 34, 91, 158, 27, 1, 953, 276, 6937, 507, 28, 3, 86, 30, 606, 348, 273, 157, 328, 56, 16, 1313, 2, 1165, 4, 7, 5, 8096, 2, 10460, 12, 3, 116, 1, 1659, 3191, 1888, 221, 788, 4, 26, 266, 10, 79, 46, 99, 538, 35, 353, 17, 56691, 152, 4, 220, 23094, 56692, 7, 4, 4283, 1, 403, 56, 22, 388, 24]",1777.0,18039424,397
Predictive clinicopathologic factors for limited response of T3 rectal cancer to combined modality therapy.,International journal of colorectal disease,Int J Colorectal Dis,2007-11-29,"The response of T3 rectal cancer to combined modality therapy (CMT) is highly predictive of long-term outcome following surgery. The aim of this study was to identify pretreatment factors associated with poor tumor response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation. A prospective institutional database at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center was queried for endorectal ultrasound (ERUS) stage T3N0-2 rectal cancer patients, treated with CMT followed by surgical resection, between 1998 and 2003. Preoperative clinicopathologic factors determined by biopsy, ERUS, proctoscopy, and digital rectal examination were correlated with the degree of downstaging of the primary mural lesion (tumor downstaging) in response to neoadjuvant therapy. Associations were analyzed by chi-square, Kaplan-Meier, and logistic regression. Of 274 patients, 51% obtained tumor downstaging in response to preoperative treatment, i.e., lower pathologic T-stage compared with pretreatment ERUS. Five-year recurrence-free survival was 89% in the cohort that obtained tumor downstaging compared with only 45% in the cohort that obtained no tumor downstaging. Factors significantly associated with limited or lack of tumor downstaging after CMT included: fixed tumor on digital rectal examination (p < 0.021), near-circumferential tumor (p < 0.011), tumor stenosis (p < 0.025), metastatic disease (p < 0.012), biopsy-proven poorly differentiated pathology (p < 0.002), and radial extension >2.5 mm on ERUS (p < 0.031). On multivariate analysis, deep radial extension on ERUS, metastatic disease, and poorly differentiated pathology were in each, independently associated with limited or lack of tumor downstaging. Pretreatment evaluation with biopsy, proctoscopy, and ERUS can identify T3 rectal cancer patients unlikely to respond well to CMT. These patients may be considered for alternative protocols and their tumors studied to ascertain the molecular events responsible for resistance to chemoradiation.",Comparative Study,4436.0,21.0,The response of T3 cancer to combined modality therapy CMT is highly predictive of long-term outcome following surgery The aim of this study was to identify pretreatment factors associated with poor tumor response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation A prospective institutional database at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center was queried for endorectal ultrasound ERUS stage T3N0-2 cancer patients treated with CMT followed by surgical resection between 1998 and 2003 Preoperative clinicopathologic factors determined by biopsy ERUS proctoscopy and digital examination were correlated with the degree of downstaging of the primary mural lesion tumor downstaging in response to neoadjuvant therapy Associations were analyzed by chi-square Kaplan-Meier and logistic regression Of 274 patients 51 obtained tumor downstaging in response to preoperative treatment i.e. lower pathologic T-stage compared with pretreatment ERUS Five-year recurrence-free survival was 89 in the cohort that obtained tumor downstaging compared with only 45 in the cohort that obtained no tumor downstaging Factors significantly associated with limited or lack of tumor downstaging after CMT included fixed tumor on digital examination p 0.021 near-circumferential tumor p 0.011 tumor stenosis p 0.025 metastatic disease p 0.012 biopsy-proven poorly differentiated pathology p 0.002 and radial extension 2.5 mm on ERUS p 0.031 On multivariate analysis deep radial extension on ERUS metastatic disease and poorly differentiated pathology were in each independently associated with limited or lack of tumor downstaging Pretreatment evaluation with biopsy proctoscopy and ERUS can identify T3 cancer patients unlikely to respond well to CMT These patients may be considered for alternative protocols and their tumors studied to ascertain the molecular events responsible for resistance to chemoradiation,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[3, 51, 1, 2065, 12, 6, 397, 1396, 36, 5380, 16, 561, 464, 1, 319, 337, 228, 366, 152, 3, 1130, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 255, 1194, 130, 41, 5, 334, 30, 51, 6, 536, 975, 8, 482, 1115, 609, 28, 2563, 2783, 2784, 12, 574, 10, 3547, 9, 5615, 1945, 16345, 82, 10816, 18, 12, 7, 73, 5, 5380, 370, 20, 221, 170, 59, 1850, 2, 1522, 498, 1399, 130, 509, 20, 411, 16345, 21943, 2, 3271, 1385, 11, 438, 5, 3, 1444, 1, 5336, 1, 3, 86, 13977, 1180, 30, 5336, 4, 51, 6, 536, 36, 685, 11, 311, 20, 3163, 3219, 876, 882, 2, 812, 320, 1, 9494, 7, 725, 683, 30, 5336, 4, 51, 6, 498, 24, 70, 563, 280, 510, 102, 82, 72, 5, 1194, 16345, 365, 111, 146, 115, 25, 10, 887, 4, 3, 180, 17, 683, 30, 5336, 72, 5, 158, 512, 4, 3, 180, 17, 683, 77, 30, 5336, 130, 97, 41, 5, 383, 15, 926, 1, 30, 5336, 50, 5380, 159, 1959, 30, 23, 3271, 1385, 19, 13, 4630, 1829, 7937, 30, 19, 13, 3651, 30, 6935, 19, 13, 4067, 113, 34, 19, 13, 3499, 411, 1930, 1240, 1442, 1117, 19, 13, 1111, 2, 6471, 2401, 18, 33, 321, 23, 16345, 19, 13, 5304, 23, 331, 65, 2369, 6471, 2401, 23, 16345, 113, 34, 2, 1240, 1442, 1117, 11, 4, 296, 1042, 41, 5, 383, 15, 926, 1, 30, 5336, 1194, 451, 5, 411, 21943, 2, 16345, 122, 255, 2065, 12, 7, 3568, 6, 1892, 149, 6, 5380, 46, 7, 68, 40, 515, 9, 1091, 2189, 2, 136, 57, 656, 6, 6040, 3, 219, 281, 2327, 9, 251, 6, 975]",1870.0,18046561,341
External beam radiation treatment for rectal cancer is associated with a decrease in subsequent prostate cancer diagnosis.,Cancer,Cancer,2008-02-01,"External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for rectal cancer unavoidably delivers significant radiation dose to the prostate gland. The effect of this incidental exposure on subsequent prostate cancer diagnosis was investigated using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry. Men diagnosed with localized or regional (L/R) rectal cancer from 1988-1997 and treated with EBRT and sphincter-sparing surgery (SSS) were identified. Men treated for L/R rectal cancer with SSS who did not receive EBRT, and men with L/R colon cancer who did not receive EBRT, were studied for comparison. Multiple Primary Standardized Incidence Ratios of observed to expected (O/E) cases of prostate cancer were calculated using SEER*Stat. In all, 1574 men with L/R rectal cancer treated with EBRT and SSS were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 64 and median survival was 76 months. Twenty were subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer, a number significantly less than expected compared with the general population of similar age and race.

Phys.,2007-12-31,"To assess the incidence of acute gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) injury and the dose-volume response in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer treated with image-guided radiotherapy using helical tomotherapy. Between November 2004 and March 2007, 146 consecutive patients with localized prostate cancer were treated with helical tomotherapy at the City of Hope Medical Center. Of the 146 patients, 70 had undergone prostatectomy. Acute GI and GU toxicities were evaluated using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Cancer of Medical scoring system. Events were scored for patients developing Grade 2 or greater morbidity within 90 days after the end of radiotherapy (RT). The dosimetric parameters included the minimal dose received by the highest 10%, 20%, 50%, 80%, and 90% of the target volume, the mean rectal dose, minimal rectal dose, maximal rectal dose, and the volume receiving > or =45, > or =65, and > or =70 Gy. These variables, plus the status of radical prostatectomy, hormonal therapy, RT techniques, and medical conditions, were included in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. A goodness-of-fit evaluation was done using the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic. A dose-response function for acute GI toxicity was elicited. The acute GI Grade 2 or greater toxicity was lower in the definitive RT group than in the postoperative RT group (25% vs. 41%, p <0.05). Acute GU Grade 2 or greater toxicity was comparable between the two groups. No grade 3 or greater complications were observed. No dosimetric variable was significant for GU toxicity. For acute GI toxicity, the significant dosimetric parameters were the minimal dose received by 10%, 20%, and 50% of the target volume and the mean rectal dose; the most predictive parameter was the minimal dose received by 10% of the target volume. The dose-modifying factor was 1.2 for radical prostatectomy. The results of our study have shown that acute rectal symptoms are dose-volume related. Postprostatectomy RT resulted in a greater incidence of acute GI toxicity than did definitive RT. For postoperative RT, it would be prudent to use different dose-volume limits.",Journal Article,4404.0,42.0,To assess the incidence of acute GI and genitourinary GU injury and the dose-volume response in patients with clinically localized cancer treated with image-guided radiotherapy using helical tomotherapy Between November 2004 and March 2007 146 consecutive patients with localized cancer were treated with helical tomotherapy at the City of Hope Medical Center Of the 146 patients 70 had undergone prostatectomy Acute GI and GU toxicities were evaluated using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Cancer of Medical scoring system Events were scored for patients developing Grade 2 or greater morbidity within 90 days after the end of radiotherapy RT The dosimetric parameters included the minimal dose received by the highest 10 20 50 80 and 90 of the target volume the mean dose minimal dose maximal dose and the volume receiving or =45 or =65 and or =70 Gy These variables plus the status of radical prostatectomy hormonal therapy RT techniques and medical conditions were included in a multivariate logistic regression analysis A goodness-of-fit evaluation was done using the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic A dose-response function for acute GI toxicity was elicited The acute GI Grade 2 or greater toxicity was lower in the definitive RT group than in the postoperative RT group 25 vs. 41 p 0.05 Acute GU Grade 2 or greater toxicity was comparable between the two groups No grade 3 or greater complications were observed No dosimetric variable was significant for GU toxicity For acute GI toxicity the significant dosimetric parameters were the minimal dose received by 10 20 and 50 of the target volume and the mean dose the most predictive parameter was the minimal dose received by 10 of the target volume The dose-modifying factor was 1.2 for radical prostatectomy The results of our study have shown that acute symptoms are dose-volume related Postprostatectomy RT resulted in a greater incidence of acute GI toxicity than did definitive RT For postoperative RT it would be prudent to use different dose-volume limits,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[6, 423, 3, 287, 1, 286, 2104, 2, 4109, 5581, 2730, 2, 3, 61, 433, 51, 4, 7, 5, 505, 909, 12, 73, 5, 1482, 1808, 310, 75, 6638, 7731, 59, 2868, 1131, 2, 2363, 1307, 4909, 935, 7, 5, 909, 12, 11, 73, 5, 6638, 7731, 28, 3, 7235, 1, 3045, 484, 574, 1, 3, 4909, 7, 431, 42, 1989, 1202, 286, 2104, 2, 5581, 385, 11, 194, 75, 3, 121, 36, 413, 87, 1865, 2533, 9, 389, 2, 12, 1, 484, 2504, 398, 281, 11, 3179, 9, 7, 931, 88, 18, 15, 378, 787, 262, 424, 162, 50, 3, 396, 1, 310, 240, 3, 3187, 1038, 159, 3, 1048, 61, 103, 20, 3, 1076, 79, 179, 212, 493, 2, 424, 1, 3, 283, 433, 3, 313, 61, 1048, 61, 2725, 61, 2, 3, 433, 357, 15, 512, 15, 556, 2, 15, 431, 381, 46, 682, 349, 3, 156, 1, 711, 1202, 1761, 36, 240, 1092, 2, 484, 1298, 11, 159, 4, 8, 331, 812, 320, 65, 8, 13148, 1, 2975, 451, 10, 1822, 75, 3, 21489, 21490, 4502, 8, 61, 51, 343, 9, 286, 2104, 155, 10, 5179, 3, 286, 2104, 88, 18, 15, 378, 155, 10, 280, 4, 3, 1057, 240, 87, 76, 4, 3, 573, 240, 87, 243, 105, 605, 19, 13, 474, 286, 5581, 88, 18, 15, 378, 155, 10, 1279, 59, 3, 100, 271, 77, 88, 27, 15, 378, 521, 11, 164, 77, 3187, 1347, 10, 93, 9, 5581, 155, 9, 286, 2104, 155, 3, 93, 3187, 1038, 11, 3, 1048, 61, 103, 20, 79, 179, 2, 212, 1, 3, 283, 433, 2, 3, 313, 61, 3, 96, 464, 4219, 10, 3, 1048, 61, 103, 20, 79, 1, 3, 283, 433, 3, 61, 4898, 161, 10, 14, 18, 9, 711, 1202, 3, 99, 1, 114, 45, 47, 443, 17, 286, 507, 32, 61, 433, 139, 10468, 240, 627, 4, 8, 378, 287, 1, 286, 2104, 155, 76, 205, 1057, 240, 9, 573, 240, 192, 688, 40, 10263, 6, 119, 338, 61, 433, 3526]",2059.0,18164841,229

cT3N0 rectal cancer: potential overtreatment with preoperative chemoradiotherapy is warranted.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2008-01-01,"Although combined-modality therapy (CMT) is the preferred treatment for T3 and/or lymph node (LN)-positive rectal cancer, the German rectal cancer study published in 2004 demonstrated that 18% of patients deemed suitable for preoperative CMT by endorectal ultrasound (ERUS) may be overstaged. Because data also suggest that LN-negative rectal cancer after total mesorectal excision may not require radiotherapy, it is reasonable to consider omitting radiotherapy for the cT3N0 subset. We therefore determined the accuracy of pre-CMT ERUS or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) staging, to explore the validity of a nonpreoperative CMT approach for cT3N0 disease. One hundred eighty-eight ERUS-/MRI-staged T3N0 rectal cancer patients received preoperative CMT (fluorouracil based and 45-50.4 Gy) followed by radical resection. Rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) and mesorectal LN involvement were determined. Tumors were located a median of 5 cm from the anal verge. Sphincter-preserving surgery was performed in 143 patients (76%). Overall pCR was 20%, and 41 patients (22%) had pathologically positive mesorectal LNs. The incidence of positive LNs significantly increased with T stage: ypT0, 3%; ypT1, 7%; ypT2, 20%; ypT3-4, 36% (P = .001).

Therefore, ERUS-/MRI-staged T3N0 rectal cancer patients should continue to receive preoperative CMT.

Patterns of locoregional recurrence after surgery and radiotherapy or chemoradiation for rectal cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2008-01-22,"To identify patterns of locoregional recurrence in patients treated with surgery and preoperative or postoperative radiotherapy or chemoradiation for rectal cancer. Between November 1989 and October 2001, 554 patients with rectal cancer were treated with surgery and preoperative (85%) or postoperative (15%) radiotherapy, with 95% receiving concurrent chemotherapy. Among these patients, 46 had locoregional recurrence as the first site of failure. Computed tomography images showing the site of recurrence and radiotherapy simulation films were available for 36 of the 46 patients. Computed tomography images were used to identify the sites of recurrence and correlate the sites to radiotherapy fields in these 36 patients. The estimated 5-year locoregional control rate was 91%. The 36 patients in the study had locoregional recurrences at 43 sites. There were 28 (65%) in-field, 7 (16%) marginal, and 8 (19%) out-of-field recurrences. Among the in-field recurrences, 15 (56%) occurred in the low pelvis, 6 (22%) in the presacral region, 4 (15%) in the mid-pelvis, and 2 (7%) in the high pelvis. Clinical T stage, pathologic T stage, and pathologic N stage were significantly associated with the risk of in-field locoregional recurrence. The median survival after locoregional recurrence was 24.6 months. Patients treated with surgery and radiotherapy or chemoradiation for rectal cancer had a low risk of locoregional recurrence, with the majority of recurrences occurring within the radiation field.

Perihepatic lymph node micrometastases impact outcome after partial hepatectomy for colorectal metastases.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2008-01-29,"Hepatectomy for resectable colorectal liver metastases provides a survival advantage but is usually reserved for patients without extrahepatic disease. Metastases to perihepatic lymph nodes (LN) occur with controversial significance. This study uses standard pathologic analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine the impact of occult metastatic disease to perihepatic LN in patients with colorectal cancer undergoing hepatectomy. Fifty-nine patients with liver metastases from colon or rectal primary cancer were studied prospectively. Perihepatic LN were sampled from the portocaval, pancreaticoduodenal, and common hepatic artery regions. All LN were analyzed using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and those negative by H&E were analyzed using IHC for cytokeratin. Recurrence and survival were compared amongst LN groups. Median follow-up was 42 months for survivors. There were eight patients with metastatic disease to at least one perihepatic LN identified by H&E and fourteen patients with metastases identified by IHC only. Forty-one patients (70%) recurred after resection, and patients with LN metastases, regardless of detection method, had a shorter recurrence-free survival compared to node negative patients. However, patterns of recurrence differed by LN group. Compared to H&E-positive patients, IHC-positive patients had a better overall survival and were more likely to recur at a single site amenable to salvage resection. In patients with hepatic colorectal metastases, IHC analysis of perihepatic LN adds prognostic value regarding the timing and burden of recurrence after resection.

The PCA3 score in men with negative biopsies (30) and positive biopsies (29) were significantly different (median 21.1 and 31.0, respectively, p = 0.029). The PCA3 score was significantly correlated with total tumor volume in prostatectomy specimens (r = 0.269, p = 0.008), and was also associated with prostatectomy Gleason score (6 vs 7 or greater, p = 0.005) but not with other clinical and pathological features. The PCA3 score was significantly different when comparing low volume/low grade cancer (dominant tumor volume less than 0.5 cc, Gleason score 6) and significant cancer (p = 0.007). On multivariate analysis PCA3 was the best predictor of total tumor volume in prostatectomy (p = 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the PCA3 score could discriminate low volume cancer (total tumor volume less than 0.5 cc) well with area under the curve of 0.757.

Prognostic implications of the distribution of lymph node metastases in rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2008-03-24,"After preoperative chemoradiotherapy of rectal cancer, the number of retrievable and metastatic lymph nodes is decreased. The current TNM classification is based on number and not location of lymph node metastases and may understage disease after chemoradiotherapy. The aim of this study was to examine the prognostic significance of location of involved lymph nodes in rectal cancer patients after preoperative chemoradiotherapy. We prospectively examined whole-mount specimens from 121 patients with uT3-4 and/or N+ rectal cancer who received preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by resection. Location of involved lymph nodes was compared with median number of lymph nodes involved as well as presence of distant metastasis at presentation. Lymph node metastases were detected in 37 patients (31%). Thirteen patients with lymph node involvement along major supplying vessels (proximal lymph node metastases) had a significantly higher rate of distant metastatic disease at time of surgery than patients without proximal lymph node involvement (P < .001); median number of lymph nodes involved was two for patients with proximal lymph node metastases and 1.5 for patients with mesorectal lymph node involvement alone. Our data suggest that, after preoperative chemoradiotherapy, proximal lymph node involvement is associated with a high incidence of metastatic disease at time of surgery. Because the median number of involved lymph nodes is low after preoperative chemoradiotherapy, the TNM staging system may not provide an accurate assessment of metastatic disease. Therefore, the ypTNM staging system should incorporate distribution as well as number of lymph node metastases after preoperative chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer.",Journal Article,4320.0,74.0,After preoperative chemoradiotherapy of cancer the number of retrievable and metastatic lymph nodes is decreased The current TNM classification is based on number and not location of lymph node metastases and may understage disease after chemoradiotherapy The aim of this study was to examine the prognostic significance of location of involved lymph nodes in cancer patients after preoperative chemoradiotherapy We prospectively examined whole-mount specimens from 121 patients with uT3-4 and/or N+ cancer who received preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by resection Location of involved lymph nodes was compared with median number of lymph nodes involved as well as presence of distant metastasis at presentation Lymph node metastases were detected in 37 patients 31 Thirteen patients with lymph node involvement along major supplying vessels proximal lymph node metastases had a significantly higher rate of distant metastatic disease at time of surgery than patients without proximal lymph node involvement P .001 median number of lymph nodes involved was two for patients with proximal lymph node metastases and 1.5 for patients with mesorectal lymph node involvement alone Our data suggest that after preoperative chemoradiotherapy proximal lymph node involvement is associated with a high incidence of metastatic disease at time of surgery Because the median number of involved lymph nodes is low after preoperative chemoradiotherapy the TNM staging system may not provide an accurate assessment of metastatic disease Therefore the ypTNM staging system should incorporate distribution as well as number of lymph node metastases after preoperative chemoradiotherapy for cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[50, 498, 1464, 1, 12, 3, 207, 1, 19025, 2, 113, 263, 502, 16, 340, 3, 291, 2918, 947, 16, 90, 23, 207, 2, 44, 1147, 1, 263, 289, 196, 2, 68, 34441, 34, 50, 1464, 3, 1130, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 1004, 3, 177, 724, 1, 1147, 1, 646, 263, 502, 4, 12, 7, 50, 498, 1464, 21, 1143, 409, 902, 9652, 623, 29, 4141, 7, 5, 31253, 39, 2, 15, 78, 12, 54, 103, 498, 1464, 370, 20, 170, 1147, 1, 646, 263, 502, 10, 72, 5, 52, 207, 1, 263, 502, 646, 22, 149, 22, 463, 1, 626, 278, 28, 1031, 263, 289, 196, 11, 530, 4, 567, 7, 456, 3170, 7, 5, 263, 289, 799, 1510, 458, 31254, 3102, 2805, 263, 289, 196, 42, 8, 97, 142, 116, 1, 626, 113, 34, 28, 98, 1, 152, 76, 7, 187, 2805, 263, 289, 799, 19, 144, 52, 207, 1, 263, 502, 646, 10, 100, 9, 7, 5, 2805, 263, 289, 196, 2, 14, 33, 9, 7, 5, 5823, 263, 289, 799, 279, 114, 74, 309, 17, 50, 498, 1464, 2805, 263, 289, 799, 16, 41, 5, 8, 64, 287, 1, 113, 34, 28, 98, 1, 152, 408, 3, 52, 207, 1, 646, 263, 502, 16, 154, 50, 498, 1464, 3, 2918, 632, 398, 68, 44, 377, 35, 1481, 455, 1, 113, 34, 673, 3, 30908, 632, 398, 257, 3360, 1395, 22, 149, 22, 207, 1, 263, 289, 196, 50, 498, 1464, 9, 12]",1687.0,18362367,439
Pathologic stage is most prognostic of disease-free survival in locally advanced rectal cancer patients after preoperative chemoradiation.,Cancer,Cancer,2008-07-01,"Preoperative chemoradiation is the standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer. However, it is uncertain whether pretreatment clinical stage, degree of response to neoadjuvant treatment, or pathologic stage is the most reliable predictor of outcome. This study compared various staging elements and treatment-related variables to identify which factors or combination of factors reliably prognosticates disease-free survival in rectal cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant combined modality therapy. From a prospectively maintained single institution database, 342 consecutive patients with locally advanced rectal cancer staged by endorectal ultrasound were identified. Patients underwent rectal resection 4 to 8 weeks after a 5.5-week course of pelvic radiotherapy/concurrent chemotherapy. The degree of tumor regression was histologically graded on each resected specimen using a previously reported response scale of 0% to 100%. Predictive models of disease-free survival were created utilizing available pretherapy and postoperative staging elements in addition to the degree of tumor regression noted histologically. Model accuracy was measured and compared by concordance index, with 95% confidence interval (CI). Stratifying patients by degree of tumor regression predicted outcome with a concordance index of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.59-0.71), which was significantly better than models using preoperative stage elements (concordance index of 0.54; 95% CI, 0.50-0.58). However, the model found to be most predictive of disease-free survival stratified patients by final pathologic T classification and N classification elements, with a concordance index of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.70-0.80).

Medicare data were collected for beneficiaries treated with one of six cancer resections and an associated cancer diagnosis from 1989 to 2002. Hospital, procedure, and incidence rates for each cancer diagnosis were stratified by state and year. The number of hospitals performing each operation per cancer incident, the number of procedures performed per cancer incident, and hospital volume were compared between states with and without CON, and those that discontinued CON during the sample period were noted. The number of hospitals per cancer incident was lower in CON states versus non-CON states for colectomy (P = .022), rectal resection (P = .026), and pulmonary lobectomy (P = .032). Hospital volume was significantly higher in CON states versus non-CON states for colectomy (P = .006) and pulmonary lobectomy (P = .043). There were no differences between states with and without CON in the number of procedures per cancer incident. Although use of cancer procedures was similar in CON and non-CON states, those with acute-care CON had fewer facilities performing oncologic resections per cancer patient.

Consenting operable patients with stage II or III adenocarcinoma of the rectum received capecitabine (825 mg/m2 PO BID, 5 days/wk x 5 weeks) and SIB-IMRT delivering 55 Gy (2.2 Gy/fraction) to the gross tumor while simultaneously delivering 45 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction) to the regional lymph nodes and areas at risk for harboring microscopic disease. Total mesorectal excision followed 6 weeks later. A single pathologist analyzed the resected tumor's TNM stage and Mandard regression/response scores. The primary end point was pathologic complete response (pCR) rate. Ten subjects were enrolled, 2 of which were ineligible (1 screening failure and 1 unrelated cerebrovascular accident occurring early in treatment). The remaining 8 patients were evaluable. All 8 completed chemoradiation with strict compliance to the protocol schedule and then went on to surgical resection. At a median follow-up of 26 months (range, 15-40), all patients were alive without evidence of recurrent disease. The crude pCR rate was 38% with 50% achieving down-staging. Of 3 patients who had tumors within 5 cm of the anal verge, 2 underwent sphincter-sparing procedures. Grade 4 diarrhea occurred in 1 of 8 (13%) patients. The remaining toxicities were grade 1 or 2. Preoperative chemoradiation with capecitabine and SIB-IMRT is well tolerated and results in an encouraging pCR rate for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",4251.0,44.0,A prospective phase II trial was conducted to evaluate the feasibility safety and pathologic response rate of preoperative capecitabine and accelerated synchronous integrated boost SIB intensity-modulated radiotherapy IMRT in patients with locally advanced cancer Consenting operable patients with stage II or III adenocarcinoma of the rectum received capecitabine 825 mg/m2 PO BID 5 days/wk x 5 weeks and SIB-IMRT delivering 55 Gy 2.2 Gy/fraction to the gross tumor while simultaneously delivering 45 Gy 1.8 Gy/fraction to the regional lymph nodes and areas at risk for harboring microscopic disease Total mesorectal excision followed 6 weeks later A single pathologist analyzed the resected tumor 's TNM stage and Mandard regression/response scores The primary end point was pathologic complete response pCR rate Ten subjects were enrolled 2 of which were ineligible 1 screening failure and 1 unrelated cerebrovascular accident occurring early in treatment The remaining 8 patients were evaluable All 8 completed chemoradiation with strict compliance to the protocol schedule and then went on to surgical resection At a median follow-up of 26 months range 15-40 all patients were alive without evidence of recurrent disease The crude pCR rate was 38 with 50 achieving down-staging Of 3 patients who had tumors within 5 cm of the verge 2 underwent sphincter-sparing procedures Grade 4 diarrhea occurred in 1 of 8 13 patients The remaining toxicities were grade 1 or 2 Preoperative chemoradiation with capecitabine and SIB-IMRT is well tolerated and results in an encouraging pCR rate for patients with locally advanced cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[8, 482, 124, 215, 160, 10, 426, 6, 376, 3, 1437, 367, 2, 510, 51, 116, 1, 498, 1629, 2, 2241, 2734, 2102, 2569, 8409, 837, 1757, 310, 964, 4, 7, 5, 795, 131, 12, 11932, 4267, 7, 5, 82, 215, 15, 316, 449, 1, 3, 3660, 103, 1629, 9295, 81, 821, 4826, 2793, 33, 162, 3293, 1006, 33, 244, 2, 8409, 964, 4790, 614, 381, 18, 18, 381, 1509, 6, 3, 1789, 30, 369, 3074, 4790, 512, 381, 14, 66, 381, 1509, 6, 3, 951, 263, 502, 2, 1361, 28, 43, 9, 2105, 2984, 34, 181, 5823, 1366, 370, 49, 244, 1559, 8, 226, 5093, 311, 3, 1133, 30, 292, 2918, 82, 2, 26711, 320, 51, 703, 3, 86, 396, 741, 10, 510, 236, 51, 604, 116, 1618, 976, 11, 346, 18, 1, 92, 11, 3773, 14, 453, 496, 2, 14, 2092, 9261, 18156, 1821, 191, 4, 24, 3, 1844, 66, 7, 11, 859, 62, 66, 781, 975, 5, 8043, 3336, 6, 3, 1182, 1055, 2, 818, 7109, 23, 6, 221, 170, 28, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 432, 53, 184, 167, 327, 62, 7, 11, 1701, 187, 241, 1, 387, 34, 3, 6622, 604, 116, 10, 519, 5, 212, 1785, 1328, 632, 1, 27, 7, 54, 42, 57, 262, 33, 494, 1, 3, 8330, 18, 208, 5400, 1851, 1369, 88, 39, 1172, 489, 4, 14, 1, 66, 233, 7, 3, 1844, 385, 11, 88, 14, 15, 18, 498, 975, 5, 1629, 2, 8409, 964, 16, 149, 421, 2, 99, 4, 35, 2269, 604, 116, 9, 7, 5, 795, 131, 12]",1626.0,18525306,449

"A panel of kallikrein markers can reduce unnecessary biopsy for prostate cancer: data from the European Randomized Study of Prostate Cancer Screening in Göteborg, Sweden.",BMC medicine,BMC Med,2008-07-08,"Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is widely used to detect prostate cancer. The low positive predictive value of elevated PSA results in large numbers of unnecessary prostate biopsies. We set out to determine whether a multivariable model including four kallikrein forms (total, free, and intact PSA, and human kallikrein 2 (hK2)) could predict prostate biopsy outcome in previously unscreened men with elevated total PSA. The study cohort comprised 740 men in Göteborg, Sweden, undergoing biopsy during the first round of the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer. We calculated the area-under-the-curve (AUC) for predicting prostate cancer at biopsy. AUCs for a model including age and PSA (the 'laboratory' model) and age, PSA and digital rectal exam (the 'clinical' model) were compared with those for models that also included additional kallikreins. Addition of free and intact PSA and hK2 improved AUC from 0.68 to 0.83 and from 0.72 to 0.84, for the laboratory and clinical models respectively. Using a 20% risk of prostate cancer as the threshold for biopsy would have reduced the number of biopsies by 424 (57%) and missed only 31 out of 152 low-grade and 3 out of 40 high-grade cancers. Multiple kallikrein forms measured in blood can predict the result of biopsy in previously unscreened men with elevated PSA.

Neoadjuvant fluorouracil (5-FU) plus radiation results in a decrease in local relapse rates and a favorable toxicity profile in comparison with postoperative adjuvant 5-FU plus radiation therapy. Recent nonrandomized comparative studies have shown that capecitabine (Xeloda) plus radiation result in downstaging and pathologic complete responses equivalent to those of 5-FU plus radiation, making this combination an acceptable alternative neoadjuvant treatment. The addition of oxaliplatin (Eloxatin) or irinotecan (Camptosar) to 5-FU or capecitabine concurrently with radiation therapy appears to result in more favorable pathologic responses in phase I/II trials.

Representatives from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) collaborated to create metrics suitable for national performance measurement. Content and methodology experts nominated by ASCO and NCCN met to select and refine metrics for breast, colon, and rectal cancer based on National Initiative for Cancer Care Quality and NCCN measures and NCCN and ASCO guidelines. Measures were selected based on their impact on disease free and overall survival, the degree to which opportunities for improvement exist, and the feasibility of data collection. Three breast cancer measures and four colorectal cancer measures were chosen. Measures for breast cancer included adjuvant hormone therapy for hormone receptor-positive tumors, chemotherapy for hormone receptor-negative cancer, and radiation after lumpectomy. Colorectal measures included adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy for rectal cancer, and adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer.

Knowledge of indications and utilization of EUS: a survey of oncologists in the United States.,Journal of clinical gastroenterology,J. Clin. Gastroenterol.,2008-09-01,"Since its advent, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has emerged as an invaluable tool in the diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal and adjacent cancers. Yet, it remains unclear how non-gastroenterologists who manage these malignancies use EUS in their practices. A link to a self-administered questionnaire, hosted on our university website, was emailed to 650 practicing medical, radiation, and surgical oncologists in the United States. Data were analyzed from 100 responses. When available, the overall utilization of EUS for staging nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was significantly low (19.0%), although available. When EUS was unavailable, majority of the patients with pancreatobiliary cancer (79%; P<0.01) were not referred for staging, unlike those with esophageal (57.9%) and rectal cancer (73.7%) were. EUS availability did not impact its use in staging gastric cancer. Majority of the respondents thought EUS made an impact in managing patients with rectal (89.5%), esophageal (84.5%), and pancreatobiliary cancers (58.5%) but not gastric (54.7%) or NSCLC (61.5%). In staging NSCLC, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspirate (35.7%) and mediastinoscopy (34.7%) were noted as the most accurate for tissue sampling of lymph nodes in levels 5, 7, and 8.

Retrospective review of a prospectively collected cancer center database. From April 1, 1984, to December 31, 2005, 582 patients with liver metastases from a primary colorectal adenocarcinoma underwent hepatic resection. Clinical and pathological factors were analyzed using Cox regression analyses and log-rank tests. Of 582 patients, 141 (24.2%) had liver metastases from a primary rectal tumor site. Treatment of the primary rectal tumor most frequently included chemoradiation therapy (59.6%) and low anterior resection (63.1%). Most rectal tumors were pathological stage T3/T4 (85.8%) and N1 (68.1%). Treatment directed at the hepatic metastases included resection only (81.5%), resection plus radiofrequency ablation (17.8%), or radiofrequency ablation only (0.7%).

J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2008-09-01,"Oxaliplatin is a platinum analog and radiosensitizer active in colorectal cancer. We performed a Phase I trial to test the safety and preliminary efficacy of adding oxaliplatin to standard preoperative chemoradiation therapy for rectal cancer. Eligible patients had T3 to T4 rectal adenocarcinoma. Patients received standard-dose radiation (50.4 Gy for 5.5 weeks) with concurrent infused 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) at 200 mg/m2 per day, 7 days per week. Oxaliplatin was given three times at 14-day intervals at 55, 70, or 85 mg/m2 during the 5.5-week radiation period, before resection. Adjuvant therapy consisted of four cycles of 5-FU (500 mg/m2 per week) with leucovorin (500 mg/m2 per week) given every 6 weeks. The main goals were to identify the maximum tolerated dose of oxaliplatin and the dose-limiting toxicities when given with 5-FU and RT. Secondary goals were to determine resectability, pathologic response, sphincter preservation, and overall survival rates. Twenty-one patients were enrolled, 5 at the 55 mg/m2 oxaliplatin dose level, 5 at 70 mg/m2, and 11 at 85 mg/m2. All patients were able to complete the preoperative chemoradiation regimen with no dose adjustments. No dose-limiting toxicities or differences in the type or extent of toxicity were noted among the groups. Nineteen patients underwent surgery (three abdominopelvic resections and 16 low anterior resections), for an 84% sphincter preservation rate. The pathologic complete response rate was 26% (5 patients), and minimal microscopic residual tumor was found in 21% (4 additional patients). Oxaliplatin was well tolerated at 85 mg/m2 given every 2 weeks in combination with standard preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer.

Chemotherapy is linked to severe vitamin D deficiency in patients with colorectal cancer.,International journal of colorectal disease,Int J Colorectal Dis,2008-10-02,"Preclinical and clinical evidence support an association between vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Normal vitamin D status has been linked to favorable health outcomes ranging from decreased risk of osteoporosis to improved cancer mortality. We performed a retrospective study to assess the impact of metastatic disease and chemotherapy treatment on vitamin D status in patients with colorectal cancer residing in Western New York. Patients, 315, with colorectal cancer treated in a single institute were assayed for 25-OH vitamin D. The association of age, gender, primary disease site and stage, body mass index, and chemotherapy with vitamin D status was investigated. Vitamin D deficiency was common among participants with a median 25-OH vitamin D level of 21.3 ng/ml (optimal range 32-100 ng/ml). Primary site of disease and chemotherapy status were associated with very low 25-OH vitamin D levels (< or =15 ng/ml) on multivariate analysis. Patients receiving chemotherapy and patients with a rectal primary were 3.7 and 2.6-fold more likely to have severe vitamin D deficiency on multivariate analysis than nonchemotherapy patients and colon cancer primary patients, respectively.

"Prostate cancer screening in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian cancer screening trial: update on findings from the initial four rounds of screening in a randomized trial.",BJU international,BJU Int.,2008-12-01,"To describe the results of the first four rounds (T0-T3) of prostate cancer screening in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial (designed to determine the value of screening in the four cancers), that for prostate cancer is evaluating whether annual screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and a digital rectal examination (DRE) reduces prostate cancer-specific mortality. In all, 38 349 men aged 55-74 years were randomized to undergo annual screening with PSA (abnormal >4.0 ng/mL) and a DRE. The follow-up of abnormal screening results was at the discretion of subjects' physicians. PLCO staff obtained records related to diagnostic follow-up of positive screen results. Compliance with screening decreased slightly from 89% at baseline to 85% at T3. Both PSA positivity rates (range 7.7-8.8% at T0-T3) and DRE positivity rates (range 6.8-7.6% at T0-T3) were relatively constant over time. The positive predictive value (PPV) of a PSA level of >4.0 ng/mL decreased from 17.9% at T0 to 10.4-12.3% at T1-T3; the PPV for DRE (in the absence of a positive PSA test) was constant over time (2.9-3.6%). Cancer was diagnosed in 1902 men (4.9%).

Screening for prostate cancer: an update.,The Canadian journal of urology,Can J Urol,2008-12-01,"The introduction of total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) testing in serum has revolutionized the detection and management of men with prostate cancer. This review will highlight some of the exciting new developments in the field of prostate cancer screening in general and from our SPORE research program at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. First, it is important to understand that the inherent variability of tPSA levels affects the interpretation of any single results. Total variation in tPSA includes both analytical (i.e., pre-analytical sample handling, laboratory processing, assay performance, and standardization) and biological variation (i.e., metabolism, renal elimination, medication, physical and sexual activity, size and integrity of the prostate). Second, recent evidence demonstrates that no single tPSA cut-off separates men at high risk for prostate cancer from men at low risk or men with ""significant"" (high grade, high volume) cancer from those with low grade, indolent cancer. Taken together with a man's age, family history, ethnicity, and digital rectal exam results, tPSA levels add to the overall estimate of the risk of cancer, allowing men to share in the decision about a biopsy. Third, men who will eventually develop prostate cancer have increased tPSA levels years or decades before the cancer is diagnosed. These tPSA levels may reflect the long duration of prostate carcinogenesis and raise the question about a causal role for tPSA in prostate cancer development and progression. Total prostate-specific antigen measurements before age 50 could help risk stratify men for intensity of prostate cancer screening. Fourth, enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of tPSA, especially its specificity, is of particular importance, since higher specificity translates into fewer biopsies in men not affected by prostate cancer. While tPSA velocity has been shown to improve the specificity of tPSA, its sensitivity is too low to avoid prostate biopsy in a patient with an elevated tPSA level. Moreover, prospective screening studies have reported that tPSA velocity does not add diagnostic value beyond tPSA level. At this time, tPSA velocity appears most useful after diagnosis and after treatment, but its value in screening and prognostication remains to be shown. Finally, while free PSA molecular isoforms and human kallikrein-related peptidase 2 (hK2) hold the promise for detection, staging, prognosis, and monitoring of prostate cancer, evidence from large prospective clinical trials remain to be reported.",Journal Article,4068.0,31.0,The introduction of total prostate-specific antigen tPSA testing in serum has revolutionized the detection and management of men with cancer This review will highlight some of the exciting new developments in the field of cancer screening in general and from our SPORE research program at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center First it is important to understand that the inherent variability of tPSA levels affects the interpretation of any single results Total variation in tPSA includes both analytical i.e. pre-analytical sample handling laboratory processing assay performance and standardization and biological variation i.e. metabolism elimination medication physical and sexual activity size and integrity of the Second recent evidence demonstrates that no single tPSA cut-off separates men at high risk for cancer from men at low risk or men with `` significant '' high grade high volume cancer from those with low grade indolent cancer Taken together with a man 's age family history ethnicity and digital exam results tPSA levels add to the overall estimate of the risk of cancer allowing men to share in the decision about a biopsy Third men who will eventually develop cancer have increased tPSA levels years or decades before the cancer is diagnosed These tPSA levels may reflect the long duration of carcinogenesis and raise the question about a causal role for tPSA in cancer development and progression Total prostate-specific antigen measurements before age 50 could help risk stratify men for intensity of cancer screening Fourth enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of tPSA especially its specificity is of particular importance since higher specificity translates into fewer biopsies in men not affected by cancer While tPSA velocity has been shown to improve the specificity of tPSA its sensitivity is too low to avoid biopsy in a patient with an elevated tPSA level Moreover prospective screening studies have reported that tPSA velocity does not add diagnostic value beyond tPSA level At this time tPSA velocity appears most useful after diagnosis and after treatment but its value in screening and prognostication remains to be shown Finally while free PSA molecular isoforms and human kallikrein-related peptidase 2 hK2 hold the promise for detection staging prognosis and monitoring of cancer evidence from large prospective clinical trials remain to be reported,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[3, 2456, 1, 181, 1364, 112, 448, 10122, 471, 4, 524, 71, 5746, 3, 638, 2, 284, 1, 325, 5, 12, 26, 206, 303, 1817, 476, 1, 3, 4963, 217, 3703, 4, 3, 1067, 1, 12, 453, 4, 1083, 2, 29, 114, 15948, 389, 1243, 28, 2563, 2783, 2784, 12, 574, 157, 192, 16, 305, 6, 1640, 17, 3, 4943, 1982, 1, 10122, 148, 2561, 3, 3037, 1, 500, 226, 99, 181, 1380, 4, 10122, 1920, 110, 5625, 70, 563, 671, 5625, 1000, 13658, 1624, 3325, 719, 528, 2, 6213, 2, 1037, 1380, 70, 563, 1600, 3730, 3012, 900, 2, 2232, 128, 444, 2, 4797, 1, 3, 419, 435, 241, 1902, 17, 77, 226, 10122, 3554, 1889, 21459, 325, 28, 64, 43, 9, 12, 29, 325, 28, 154, 43, 15, 325, 5, 93, 522, 64, 88, 64, 433, 12, 29, 135, 5, 154, 88, 2316, 12, 1633, 1162, 5, 8, 3628, 292, 89, 607, 532, 2091, 2, 3271, 6747, 99, 10122, 148, 4178, 6, 3, 63, 1191, 1, 3, 43, 1, 12, 2952, 325, 6, 4349, 4, 3, 948, 545, 8, 411, 1282, 325, 54, 303, 3124, 690, 12, 47, 101, 10122, 148, 60, 15, 1968, 348, 3, 12, 16, 265, 46, 10122, 148, 68, 2694, 3, 319, 654, 1, 1719, 2, 5008, 3, 2840, 545, 8, 5163, 200, 9, 10122, 4, 12, 193, 2, 91, 181, 1364, 112, 448, 1685, 348, 89, 212, 359, 987, 43, 3570, 325, 9, 837, 1, 12, 453, 3608, 2430, 3, 752, 1190, 1, 10122, 1093, 211, 1121, 16, 1, 1454, 1187, 1192, 142, 1121, 10328, 237, 1497, 1154, 4, 325, 44, 1424, 20, 12, 369, 10122, 6025, 71, 85, 443, 6, 401, 3, 1121, 1, 10122, 211, 485, 16, 5044, 154, 6, 3085, 411, 4, 8, 69, 5, 35, 804, 10122, 301, 1393, 482, 453, 94, 47, 210, 17, 10122, 6025, 1097, 44, 4178, 752, 549, 1654, 10122, 301, 28, 26, 98, 10122, 6025, 1233, 96, 999, 50, 147, 2, 50, 24, 84, 211, 549, 4, 453, 2, 4260, 469, 6, 40, 443, 1368, 369, 115, 534, 219, 3913, 2, 171, 8461, 139, 14312, 18, 5317, 4164, 3, 1783, 9, 638, 632, 356, 2, 1315, 1, 12, 241, 29, 375, 482, 38, 143, 918, 6, 40, 210]",2387.0,19046489,410

Multidisciplinary management of resectable rectal cancer. New developments and controversies.,"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)","Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",2008-11-01,"Until 2004, initial surgery and, in cases of pT3 and/or node-positive disease, postoperative chemoradiotherapy (radiation plus concurrent chemotherapy) was the conventional approach for patients with clinical T3 and/or node-positive rectal cancer. The German CAO/ARO/AIO 94 trial confirmed that, compared with preoperative chemoradiotherapy, postoperative chemoradiotherapy is associated with significantly higher local failure and toxicity rates as well as a decrease in the incidence of sphincter preservation. These data resulted in a change from postoperative to preoperative chemoradiotherapy. This shift to preoperative therapy has prompted a series of new questions regarding the multidisciplinary management of rectal cancer, including: What is the ideal neoadjuvant approach (short-course vs. combined-modality therapy)? Is postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy necessary for all patients following preoperative chemoradiotherapy? Do patients with node-negative rectal cancer require pelvic radiation?

Elective clinical target volumes for conformal therapy in anorectal cancer: a radiation therapy oncology group consensus panel contouring atlas.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int.

Phys.,2008-12-29,"To develop a Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) atlas of the elective clinical target volume (CTV) definitions to be used for planning pelvic intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for anal and rectal cancers. The Gastrointestinal Committee of the RTOG established a task group (the nine physician co-authors) to develop this atlas. They responded to a questionnaire concerning three elective CTVs (CTVA: internal iliac, presacral, and perirectal nodal regions for both anal and rectal case planning; CTVB: external iliac nodal region for anal case planning and for selected rectal cases; CTVC: inguinal nodal region for anal case planning and for select rectal cases), and to outline these areas on individual computed tomographic images. The imaging files were shared via the Advanced Technology Consortium. A program developed by one of the co-authors (I.E.N.) used binomial maximum-likelihood estimates to generate a 95% group consensus contour. The computer-estimated consensus contours were then reviewed by the group and modified to provide a final contouring consensus atlas. The panel achieved consensus CTV definitions to be used as guidelines for the adjuvant therapy of rectal cancer and definitive therapy for anal cancer. The most important difference from similar atlases for gynecologic or genitourinary cancer is mesorectal coverage. Detailed target volume contouring guidelines and images are discussed.

"Sacral insufficiency fractures after preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer: incidence, risk factors, and clinical course.","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2009-01-13,"Sacral insufficiency (SI) fractures can occur as a late side effect of pelvic radiation therapy. Our goal was to determine the incidence, risk factors, and clinical course of SI fractures in patients treated with preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer. Between 1989 and 2004, 562 patients with non-metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma were treated with preoperative chemoradiation followed by mesorectal excision. The median radiotherapy dose was 45 Gy. The hospital records and radiology reports of these patients were reviewed to identify those with pelvic fractures. Radiology images of patients with pelvic fractures were then reviewed to identify those with SI fractures. Among the 562 patients, 15 had SI fractures. The 3-year actuarial rate of SI fractures was 3.1%. The median time to SI fractures was 17 months (range, 2-34 months). The risk of SI fractures was significantly higher in women compared to men (5.8% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.014), and in whites compared with non-whites (4% vs. 0%, p = 0.037). On multivariate analysis, gender independently predicted for the risk of SI fractures (hazard ratio, 3.25; p = 0.031). Documentation about the presence or absence of pain was available for 13 patients; of these 7 (54%) had symptoms requiring pain medications. The median duration of pain was 22 months.

These advances include clinical staging such as endorectal ultrasound and pelvic MRI, surgical approaches such as transanal excision, and adjuvant treatments such as new chemotherapeutic agents and refined radiotherapy techniques. Optimal patient outcomes depend on multidisciplinary involvement for tailored therapy. The successful management of rectal cancer requires a multidisciplinary approach, with treatment decisions based on precise patient evaluations by a group of clinicians, including surgeons, gastroenterologists, medical and radiation oncologists, radiologists, and pathologists. The accurate identification of patients who are candidates for combined modality treatment is particularly essential to optimize outcomes.

Sphincter preservation in low rectal cancer is facilitated by preoperative chemoradiation and intersphincteric dissection.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2009-02-01,"The aim of this study was to evaluate oncologic outcome in patients with locally advanced distal rectal cancer treated with preoperative chemoradiation followed by low anterior resection (LAR)/stapled coloanal anastomosis, LAR/intersphincteric dissection/hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis, or abdominoperineal resection (APR). Distal rectal cancer presents a surgical challenge, and the goals of treatment often include tumor eradication without sacrifice of the anal sphincters. The technique of intersphincteric resection removes the internal anal sphincter to gain additional distal rectal margin in hopes of avoiding a permanent stoma. We analyzed 148 patients with stage II and III rectal cancers (endorectal ultrasound staged uT3-4 and/or uN1) located < or =6 cm from the anal verge, treated by preoperative chemoradiation and total mesorectal excision from 1998 to 2004. Eighty-five patients (57%) had sphincter-preserving resection (41, LAR/stapled coloanal anastomosis; 44, LAR/intersphincteric resection/hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis); 63 patients had APR. Patients undergoing APR were older, with more poorly differentiated tumors evidencing less response to chemoradiation and more likely to require extended resection. Complete resection with negative histologic margins was achieved in 92%; circumferential margins were positive in 2 (5%) of 44 in the intersphincteric resection group and 8 (13%) of 63 in the APR group. Distal margins were positive in 2 (5%) of 44 in the intersphincteric resection group. With median follow-up of 47 months, there were a total of 7 local recurrences (5%): 1, 0, and 6 in the stapled anastomosis, intersphincteric resection, and APR groups, respectively.

Favorable toxicity and biochemical control using real-time inverse optimization technique for prostate brachytherapy.,Brachytherapy,Brachytherapy,2009-02-12,"Favorable dosimetric results have been reported using intraoperative inverse optimization (IO) for permanent prostate brachytherapy. The clinical implications of these improvements in dosimetry are unclear. We review toxicity and early biochemical outcomes for patients implanted using IO technique. Between 2001 and 2007, 165 patients received permanent prostate implants using real-time IO and had >/=3 months of followup. Dose constraints for inverse planning were: the prostate volume receiving 100% of the prescription dose [prostate V(100)] was >95%; the dose received by 90% of the gland [prostate D(90)] was within the 140-180 by dose range; the volume of urethra receiving 150% of the prescription dose [urethra V(150)] was <30%; and the volume of rectal wall receiving 110% of the prescription dose [rectal V(110)] was <1.0 cc. Toxicity was prospectively scored using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group toxicity scale and the International Prostate Symptom Score questionnaire. Biochemical control was determined using the nadir + 2 ng/mL definition. Mean followup was 30 months (range, 6-63 months). Risk classification was low risk in 89% and intermediate risk in 11%. Iodine-125 sources were used for 161 implants and palladium-103 sources for four implants.

Symptom burden was prospectively assessed before (baseline) and weekly during CRT by patient self-reported questionnaires, the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI), and Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). Survival probabilities were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Symptom scores according to tumor downstaging (TDS) were compared using Student's t tests. Logistic regression was used to determine whether symptom burden levels predicted for TDS. Lowess curves were plotted for symptom burden across time. Among 51 patients evaluated for pathologic response, 26 patients (51%) had TDS. Fatigue, pain, and drowsiness were the most common symptoms. All symptoms increased progressively during treatment.

The subjects and health care providers received the results and decided on the type of follow-up evaluation. Usual care sometimes included screening, as some organizations have recommended. The numbers of all cancers and deaths and causes of death were ascertained. In the screening group, rates of compliance were 85% for PSA testing and 86% for digital rectal examination. Rates of screening in the control group increased from 40% in the first year to 52% in the sixth year for PSA testing and ranged from 41 to 46% for digital rectal examination. After 7 years of follow-up, the incidence of prostate cancer per 10,000 person-years was 116 (2820 cancers) in the screening group and 95 (2322 cancers) in the control group (rate ratio, 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16 to 1.29). The incidence of death per 10,000 person-years was 2.0 (50 deaths) in the screening group and 1.7 (44 deaths) in the control group (rate ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.70). The data at 10 years were 67% complete and consistent with these overall findings. After 7 to 10 years of follow-up, the rate of death from prostate cancer was very low and did not differ significantly between the two study groups.

"Staging, prognostic factors, and therapy of localized rectal cancer.",Current oncology reports,Curr Oncol Rep,2009-05-01,"Many recent developments have taken place in the management of rectal cancer. Appropriate staging plays an increasingly important role in rectal cancer, because many treatment decisions must be based on preoperative staging. Also critical is the role of prognostic factors such as the pathologic T (tumor) and N (nodal) classification, circumferential resection margin, and response to preoperative therapy. For stage II and III rectal cancer, preoperative chemo-radiation and radiotherapy have been accepted widely as a standard of care. The German Rectal Cancer Trial demonstrated the superiority of preoperative chemoradiation over postoperative chemoradiation, whereas the trials from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer and Fédération Francophone de Cancérologie Digestive showed the benefits of preoperative chemoradiation over preoperative long-course radiotherapy. Multiple randomized trials also have established the role of hypofractionated or short-course radiotherapy.

A retrospective toxicity analysis was performed in 30 consecutive patients treated definitively with pelvic SIB-IMRT, all of whom also received androgen suppression. The IMRT plans were designed to deliver 70 Gy in 28 fractions (2.5 Gy/fraction) to the prostate while simultaneously delivering 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions (1.8 Gy/fraction) to the pelvic lymph nodes. The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, was used to score toxicity. The most common acute Grade 2 events were cystitis (36.7%) and urinary frequency/urgency (26.7%). At a median follow-up of 24 months, late toxicity exceeding Grade 2 in severity was uncommon, with two Grade 3 events and one Grade 4 event. Grade 2 or greater acute bowel toxicity was associated with signficantly greater bowel volume receiving > or =25 Gy (p = .04); Grade 2 or greater late bowel toxicity was associated with a higher bowel maximal dose (p = .04) and volume receiving > or =50 Gy (p = .02). Acute or late bladder and rectal toxicity did not correlate with any of the dosimetric parameters examined. Pelvic IMRT with SIB to the prostate was well tolerated in this series, with low rates of Grade 3 or greater acute and late toxicity.

Long-term survival after transanal excision of T1 rectal cancer.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2009-04-01,"Several series report higher recurrence after transanal excision of T1 rectal cancer than after radical resection. However, the impact of transanal excision on cancer mortality has not been adequately studied. The purpose of this study was to compare oncologic outcomes of transanal excision with those of radical resection. Patients with transanal excision or radical resection for T1 rectal cancer treated between 1985 and 2004 were identified from a prospective database. Patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy or radiation or with tumors >12 cm from the anal verge were excluded. The final cohort comprised 145 radical resections and 137 transanal excisions. The transanal excision group was notable for older mean age (64 vs. 59 years), shorter mean distance from anal verge (5.9 vs. 7.8 cm), and smaller tumor size (2.3 vs. 3.1 cm). Lymphovascular invasion and poor differentiation were similar in both groups. Twenty percent of radical resection specimens had lymph node metastasis. Median follow-up was 5.6 years. Local recurrence was noted in a higher proportion of transanal excision patients (13.2 vs. 2.7 percent, P = 0.001). After transanal excision the hazard ratio for local recurrence was 11.3 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.6-49.2), and disease-specific survival was inferior (87 vs. 96 percent at 5 years, P = 0.03, hazard ratio 2.8 [range, 1.04-7.3]).

A total of 505 (66% male; 55% > or =70 y) subjects from 4 institutions were examined; 42% had no adenoma, 32% had nonadvanced distal adenoma, and 25% had advanced distal adenoma at the baseline Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian cancer screening trial examination (8.2 years before ACF examination on average). A total of 68% of this population had 1 or more ACF, 43% had 1 to 3, 19% had 4 to 6, and 5% had 7 or more. Baseline adenoma status was not associated with ACF prevalence (range, 66%-69%) or mean number of ACF (range, 3.1-3.5). Of 143 endoscopic ACF examined histologically, 68.5% were confirmed to be ACF. In a logistic model, current (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-5.6) and former smoking (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.5) were associated with higher ACF prevalence; a body mass index greater than 30 was associated with lower prevalence (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.35-0.8). Age, sex, family history of colorectal cancer, and aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use were not associated significantly with ACF prevalence. ACF prevalence and number were not associated with adenoma history, and only 68.5% of endoscopic ACF were confirmed histologically.

Between April 2004 and December 2007, 25 patients with clinically staged T3N1 (n = 20) or T3N0 (n = 5) rectal cancer received neoadjuvant therapy with radiotherapy (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions over 5.5 weeks), bevacizumab every 2 weeks (3 doses of 5 mg/kg), and capecitabine (900 mg/m(2) orally twice daily only on days of radiation), followed by surgical resection a median of 7.3 weeks later. Procedures included abdominoperineal resection (APR; 6 patients), proctectomy with coloanal anastamosis (8 patients), low anterior resection (10 patients), and local excision (1 patient). Eight (32%) of 25 patients had a pathologic complete response, and 6 (24%) of 25 had <10% viable tumor cells in the specimen. No patient had Grade 3 hand-foot syndrome, gastrointestinal toxicity, or significant hematologic toxicity. Three wound complications required surgical intervention (one coloanal anastamostic dehiscence requiring completion APR and two perineal wound dehiscences after initial APR). Five minor complications occurred that resolved without operative intervention. With a median follow-up of 22.7 months (range, 4.5-32.4 months), all patients were alive; one patient has had a recurrence in the pelvis (2-year actuarial rate, 6.2%) and 3 had distant recurrences.

Using QRRO survey data to assess compliance with quality indicators for breast and prostate cancer.,Journal of the American College of Radiology : JACR,J Am Coll Radiol,2009-06-01,"Quality Research in Radiation Oncology (QRRO) has embarked on a new national process survey to provide benchmark data that will allow radiation oncologists to assess the quality of care in their own practices by measuring quality indicators (QIs) and comparing individual with national practice. Investigators at QRRO developed QIs on the basis of nationally recognized, evidence-based guidelines such as those of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, as well as additional emerging QIs for processes involving rapidly emerging technology. They specifically defined the QIs as clinical performance measures. Published results of the national survey database for patients treated in 1998 and 1999 were reviewed and additional analyses conducted to assess data adequacy to measure compliance with these clinical performance measures. Examples of workup QIs for breast cancer patients showed that 97% underwent diagnostic bilateral mammography, 96% underwent pathology reviews, 83% underwent the determination of estrogen receptor status, 81% underwent the determination of progesterone receptor status, and 31% underwent the determination of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status. Compliance with treatment QIs for field recommendations on the basis of nodal findings can be measured. Of patients with prostate cancer, 90% underwent digital rectal examinations, 99% underwent prostate-specific antigen tests, and 99% had their Gleason scores determined. Compliance with QIs on the basis of prognostic group can also be measured. Benchmarking utilization patterns provides a foundation for assessing the appropriateness of cancer care in the future.

Biomarkers for response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2009-07-01,"Locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) is currently treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Although approximately 45% of patients respond to neoadjuvant therapy with T-level downstaging, there is no effective method of predicting which patients will respond. Molecular biomarkers have been investigated for their ability to predict outcome in LARC treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation. A literature search using PubMed resulted in the initial assessment of 1,204 articles. Articles addressing the ability of a biomarker to predict outcome for LARC treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation were included. Six biomarkers met the criteria for review: p53, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), thymidylate synthase, Ki-67, p21, and bcl-2/bax. On the basis of composite data, p53 is unlikely to have utility as a predictor of response. Epidermal growth factor receptor has shown promise as a predictor when quantitatively evaluated in pretreatment biopsies or when EGFR polymorphisms are evaluated in germline DNA.

Treatment for patients with rectal cancer and a clinical complete response to neoadjuvant therapy: a decision analysis.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2009-05-01,"A clinical complete response to neoadjuvant therapy occurs in a subset of patients with rectal cancer. Management of these patients is controversial and tension exists between the recurrence risk with observation, and the impact of surgery on quality-of-life. Therefore, the objective was to develop a decision-analytic model to evaluate the relative benefits of surgery vs. observation in rectal cancer patients who achieve clinical complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Clinically relevant inputs and events, including the ability to identify complete responders, likelihood of relapse and of salvage surgery after relapse, and utilities for each health state, were simulated by use of a Markov state-transition model. Transition probabilities and health-state utilities were derived from the literature and expert consensus. One-way and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of model results to assumptions. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted life expectancy. In the base-case analysis, the quality-adjusted life expectancy with surgery exceeded observation (5.63 vs. 5.34 quality-adjusted life-years). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that observation was preferred to surgery if the ability to correctly identify patients with true complete responses exceeded 58 percent, if quality-of-life after surgery was poor (utility <0.81), or if the relative reduction in recurrence risk with surgery was <43 percent when compared with observation. Our model outlines the issues associated with surgery vs. observation, and suggests that surgery is beneficial for the average patient with rectal cancer with a clinical complete response after neoadjuvant therapy. Current limitations in the clinical assessment of patient response to chemoradiation constitute an important factor influencing our results, and therefore warrant further investigation.",Journal Article,3917.0,23.0,A clinical complete response to neoadjuvant therapy occurs in a subset of patients with cancer Management of these patients is controversial and tension exists between the recurrence risk with observation and the impact of surgery on quality-of-life Therefore the objective was to develop a decision-analytic model to evaluate the relative benefits of surgery vs. observation in cancer patients who achieve clinical complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiation Clinically relevant inputs and events including the ability to identify complete responders likelihood of relapse and of salvage surgery after relapse and utilities for each health state were simulated by use of a Markov state-transition model Transition probabilities and health-state utilities were derived from the literature and expert consensus One-way and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of model results to assumptions The primary outcome was quality-adjusted life expectancy In the base-case analysis the quality-adjusted life expectancy with surgery exceeded observation 5.63 vs. 5.34 quality-adjusted life-years Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that observation was preferred to surgery if the ability to correctly identify patients with true complete responses exceeded 58 percent if quality-of-life after surgery was poor utility 0.81 or if the relative reduction in recurrence risk with surgery was 43 percent when compared with observation Our model outlines the issues associated with surgery vs. observation and suggests that surgery is beneficial for the average patient with cancer with a clinical complete response after neoadjuvant therapy Current limitations in the clinical assessment of patient response to chemoradiation constitute an important factor influencing our results and therefore warrant further investigation,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[8, 38, 236, 51, 6, 536, 36, 1780, 4, 8, 697, 1, 7, 5, 12, 284, 1, 46, 7, 16, 2010, 2, 11988, 2481, 59, 3, 146, 43, 5, 1664, 2, 3, 345, 1, 152, 23, 372, 1, 358, 673, 3, 461, 10, 6, 690, 8, 948, 5146, 202, 6, 376, 3, 580, 1141, 1, 152, 105, 1664, 4, 12, 7, 54, 1359, 38, 236, 51, 50, 536, 975, 505, 867, 11785, 2, 281, 141, 3, 801, 6, 255, 236, 1983, 1420, 1, 429, 2, 1, 992, 152, 50, 429, 2, 7114, 9, 296, 341, 1309, 11, 5872, 20, 119, 1, 8, 6516, 1309, 1970, 202, 1970, 3518, 2, 341, 1309, 7114, 11, 526, 29, 3, 789, 2, 2005, 1391, 104, 2255, 2, 100, 2255, 485, 318, 11, 173, 6, 423, 3, 7031, 1, 202, 99, 6, 8387, 3, 86, 228, 10, 372, 586, 358, 3399, 4, 3, 1782, 473, 65, 3, 372, 586, 358, 3399, 5, 152, 4726, 1664, 33, 676, 105, 33, 562, 372, 586, 358, 60, 485, 65, 264, 17, 1664, 10, 2514, 6, 152, 492, 3, 801, 6, 4911, 255, 7, 5, 2501, 236, 253, 4726, 717, 714, 492, 372, 1, 358, 50, 152, 10, 334, 1207, 13, 865, 15, 492, 3, 580, 628, 4, 146, 43, 5, 152, 10, 601, 714, 198, 72, 5, 1664, 114, 202, 6510, 3, 1553, 41, 5, 152, 105, 1664, 2, 844, 17, 152, 16, 2524, 9, 3, 1011, 69, 5, 12, 5, 8, 38, 236, 51, 50, 536, 36, 291, 1939, 4, 3, 38, 455, 1, 69, 51, 6, 975, 4999, 35, 305, 161, 4743, 114, 99, 2, 673, 2946, 195, 940]",1848.0,19502849,480
Combined modality therapy in the elderly population.,Current treatment options in oncology,Curr Treat Options Oncol,2009-06-09,"The incidence of cancer among older patients continues to rise. The use of combined modality therapy has improved survival in a variety of malignancies, including rectal, head and neck, and lung cancer; however, the addition of chemotherapy increases substantially the toxicities of treatment. Elderly patients have generally been excluded from prospective clinical trials and as such, there is a lack of evidence-based data with regards to the most appropriate treatment. Age itself should not be used as a criterion for foregoing combined modality therapy in elderly patients. Due to the increased toxicity of therapy, patients must be carefully selected. Any medical intervention should account for life expectancy, performance status, tolerance to therapy, and presence of medical or social conditions that may impact therapy. We encourage a comprehensive geriatric assessment to evaluate functional status, comorbidities, mental status, psychological state, social support, nutritional status, polypharmacy, and geriatric conditions in order to improve a patient's overall functional status during the course of therapy. Fit elderly patients should be considered candidates for combined modality therapy, however, because they are potentially more vulnerable to therapy, careful attention should be paid to hydration and nutritional status with early intervention when necessary.

In addition, we seek to identify factors which are associated with surgical intervention. The study cohort was identified from International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 codes for diagnosis of infection of the anal and rectal region and patients who underwent a surgical oncology consultation at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1/2000 and 12/2006. Clinical presentation, treatment rendered, and outcomes were retrospectively recorded. Of the 100 patients evaluated by the surgical oncology service for anorectal infection, 42 were treated nonoperatively and 58 underwent surgical intervention. Factors associated with surgical intervention based on logistic multivariable analysis included diagnosis of an abscess [odds ratio (OR) 10.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.9-38.5] and documentation of erythema on physical examination (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.1-8.4). Thrombocytopenia (platelets <50,000) was associated with nonoperative management (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.7). Incision and drainage was the most common surgical procedure (79%) while a wide debridement for a necrotizing soft tissue infection was required in two patients.

Lymph node status after neoadjuvant radiotherapy for rectal cancer is a biologic predictor of outcome.,Cancer,Cancer,2009-12-01,"Lymph node (LN) status after surgery for rectal cancer is affected by preoperative radiotherapy. The purpose of this study was to perform a population-based evaluation of the impact of pathologic LN status (ypN) after neoadjuvant radiotherapy on survival. Patients undergoing radical resection for rectal adenocarcinoma were identified from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results registry (1991-2004). Patient characteristics, overall survival, and cancer-specific survival (CSS) by ypN stage after surgery and use of preoperative or postoperative radiotherapy were compared. Of the 23,809 patients identified, 12,513 received preoperative (n = 5367) or postoperative (n = 7146) radiotherapy and resection. Preoperative patients were more likely to be younger (P < .001) and histopathologically free of detectable nodal metastasis (ypN0) than postoperative (51.8% vs 31.7%, P < .001). Median total numbers of LNs (6 vs 10) and positive LNs (2 vs 3) were lower among preoperative than postoperative (P < .001 for both). OS and CSS were similar among pN0 patients. However, on proportional hazards regression, ypN+ stage was associated with an increase in relative risk for death by 21% overall (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.21; 95% confidence interval 1.09-1.35, P < .001) and 23% cancer-specific (HR = 1.23; P = .001) for preoperative compared with postoperative. Pathologic LN status after neoadjuvant radiotherapy for rectal cancer is a biologic marker of prognosis.

Centralization of cancer surgery: implications for patient access to optimal care.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-08-31,"The volume-outcomes relationship has led many to advocate centralization of cancer procedures at high volume hospitals (HVH). We hypothesized that in response cancer surgery has become increasingly centralized and that this centralization has resulted in increased travel burden for patients. Using 1996 to 2006 discharge data from NY, NJ, PA, all patients > or = 18 years old treated with extirpative surgery for colorectal, esophageal, or pancreatic cancer were examined. Patients and hospitals were geocoded. Annual hospital procedure volume for each tumor site was examined, and multiple quantile and logistic regressions were used to compare changes in centralization and distance traveled. Five thousand two hundred seventy-three esophageal, 13,472 pancreatic, 202,879 colon, and 51,262 rectal procedures were included. A shift to HVH occurred to varying degrees for all tumor types. The odds of surgery at a low volume hospital decreased for esophagus, pancreas and colon: per year odds ratios (ORs) were 0.87 (95% CI, 0.85 to 0.90), 0.85 (95% CI, 0.84 to 0.87), and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.97 to 0.98). Median travel distance increased for all sites: esophagus 72%, pancreas 40%, colon 17%, and rectum 28% (P < .0001). Travel distance was proportional to procedure volume (P < .0001).

Concordance with NCCN Colorectal Cancer Guidelines and ASCO/NCCN Quality Measures: an NCCN institutional analysis.,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,2009-09-01,"The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Outcomes Database was created to assess concordance to evidence- and consensus-based guidelines and to measure adherence to quality measures on an ongoing basis. The Colorectal Cancer Database began in 2005 as a collaboration among 8 NCCN centers. Newly diagnosed colon and rectal cancer patients presenting to 1 of 8 NCCN centers between September 1, 2005, and May 21, 2008, were eligible for analysis of concordance with NCCN treatment guidelines for colorectal cancer and with a set of quality metrics jointly developed by ASCO and NCCN in 2007. Adherence rates were determined for each metric. Center-specific rates were benchmarked against mean concordance rates for all participating centers. A total of 3443 patients were evaluable. Mean concordance rates with NCCN colorectal cancer guidelines and ASCO/NCCN quality measures were generally high ( >or= 90%). However, relatively low mean concordance rates were noted for adjuvant chemotherapy treatment recommendations within 9 months of diagnosis of stage II to III rectal cancer (81%), and neoadjuvant chemoradiation in clinical T4 rectal primaries (83%). These low rates of concordance seemed to be consistent across centers.

"CDK8 expression in 470 colorectal cancers in relation to beta-catenin activation, other molecular alterations and patient survival.",International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2010-06-01,"Alterations in the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway define a key event in the pathogenesis of colon cancer. We have recently shown that CDK8, the gene encoding a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) component of the Mediator complex, acts as a colon cancer oncogene that is necessary for beta-catenin activity. Here, we tested the hypothesis that colorectal cancers with CDK8 expression have distinct clinical, prognostic and molecular attributes. Among 470 colorectal cancers identified in 2 prospective cohort studies, CDK8 expression was detected in 329 (70%) tumors by immunohistochemistry. Cox proportional hazards model and backward stepwise elimination were used to compute hazard ratio (HR) of deaths according to CDK8 status, initially adjusted for various patient and molecular features, including beta-catenin, p53, p21, p27 (CDK inhibitors), cyclin D1, fatty acid synthase (FASN), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), microsatellite instability (MSI), CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), LINE-1 methylation, and mutations in KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA. CDK8 expression in colorectal cancer was independently associated with beta-catenin activation (p = 0.0002), female gender (p < 0.0001) and FASN overexpression (p = 0.0003). Among colon cancer patients, CDK8 expression significantly increased colon cancer-specific mortality in both univariate analysis [HR 1.70; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-2.83; p = 0.039] and multivariate analysis (adjusted HR 2.05; 95% CI, 1.18-3.56; p = 0.011) that was adjusted for potential confounders including beta-catenin, COX-2, FASN, LINE-1 hypomethylation, CIMP and MSI. CDK8 expression was unrelated with clinical outcome among rectal cancer patients. These data support a potential link between CDK8 and beta-catenin, and suggest that CDK8 may identify a subset of colon cancer patients with a poor prognosis.",Comparative Study,3521.0,63.0,Alterations in the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway define a key event in the pathogenesis of cancer We have recently shown that CDK8 the gene encoding a cyclin-dependent kinase CDK component of the Mediator complex acts as a cancer oncogene that is necessary for beta-catenin activity Here we tested the hypothesis that cancers with CDK8 expression have distinct clinical prognostic and molecular attributes Among 470 cancers identified in 2 prospective cohort studies CDK8 expression was detected in 329 70 tumors by immunohistochemistry Cox proportional hazards model and backward stepwise elimination were used to compute hazard ratio HR of deaths according to CDK8 status initially adjusted for various patient and molecular features including beta-catenin p53 p21 p27 CDK inhibitors cyclin D1 fatty acid synthase FASN cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 microsatellite instability MSI CpG island methylator phenotype CIMP LINE-1 methylation and mutations in KRAS BRAF and PIK3CA CDK8 expression in cancer was independently associated with beta-catenin activation p 0.0002 female gender p 0.0001 and FASN overexpression p 0.0003 Among cancer patients CDK8 expression significantly increased cancer-specific mortality in both univariate analysis HR 1.70 95 confidence interval CI 1.03-2.83 p 0.039 and multivariate analysis adjusted HR 2.05 95 CI 1.18-3.56 p 0.011 that was adjusted for potential confounders including beta-catenin COX-2 FASN LINE-1 hypomethylation CIMP and MSI CDK8 expression was unrelated with clinical outcome among cancer patients These data support a potential link between CDK8 and beta-catenin and suggest that CDK8 may identify a subset of cancer patients with a poor prognosis,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[593, 4, 3, 2112, 1090, 1778, 308, 1107, 8, 825, 774, 4, 3, 1384, 1, 12, 21, 47, 761, 443, 17, 15727, 3, 145, 2362, 8, 1226, 470, 216, 3954, 1249, 1, 3, 3810, 840, 4459, 22, 8, 12, 1836, 17, 16, 1493, 9, 1090, 1778, 128, 467, 21, 650, 3, 1492, 17, 163, 5, 15727, 55, 47, 834, 38, 177, 2, 219, 7372, 107, 7532, 163, 108, 4, 18, 482, 180, 94, 15727, 55, 10, 530, 4, 8766, 431, 57, 20, 888, 418, 831, 1017, 202, 2, 10877, 5497, 3730, 11, 95, 6, 9577, 360, 197, 168, 1, 1043, 768, 6, 15727, 156, 1625, 586, 9, 747, 69, 2, 219, 404, 141, 1090, 1778, 624, 2657, 2804, 3954, 222, 1226, 2146, 4038, 971, 3522, 5728, 4043, 18, 418, 18, 2226, 1753, 1494, 2075, 3454, 5440, 1005, 2302, 328, 14, 569, 2, 138, 4, 723, 566, 2, 1506, 15727, 55, 4, 12, 10, 1042, 41, 5, 1090, 1778, 363, 19, 13, 3531, 1061, 1632, 19, 13, 488, 2, 5728, 851, 19, 13, 4418, 107, 12, 7, 15727, 55, 97, 101, 12, 112, 282, 4, 110, 880, 65, 168, 14, 431, 48, 307, 268, 58, 14, 680, 18, 852, 19, 13, 5955, 2, 331, 65, 586, 168, 18, 474, 48, 58, 14, 203, 27, 664, 19, 13, 3651, 17, 10, 586, 9, 174, 4423, 141, 1090, 1778, 418, 18, 5728, 328, 14, 4441, 2302, 2, 1494, 15727, 55, 10, 2092, 5, 38, 228, 107, 12, 7, 46, 74, 538, 8, 174, 3460, 59, 15727, 2, 1090, 1778, 2, 309, 17, 15727, 68, 255, 8, 697, 1, 12, 7, 5, 8, 334, 356]",1686.0,19790197,603
Local excision after preoperative chemoradiation results in an equivalent outcome to total mesorectal excision in selected patients with T3 rectal cancer.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2009-10-22,"We previously reported 26 patients who underwent preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CXRT) for T3 rectal cancer and were subsequently offered full-thickness local excision (LE) as an alternative to total mesorectal excision (TME). At nearly 4 years' follow-up, no difference in outcome was observed. This study compares outcomes in a larger cohort of patients and reevaluates the original 26 patients after longer follow-up. Retrospective review was performed of patients who underwent preoperative CXRT (radiation doses of 45, 50.4, or 52.5 Gy with concurrent 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy) followed by surgery for T3 rectal cancer. Forty-seven patients underwent LE (Kraske [n = 6] or transanal excision [n = 41]). 473 patients underwent TME (abdominoperineal resection [n = 141] or low anterior resection [n = 332]). Local recurrence, disease-free survival (DFS), disease-specific survival, and overall survival (OS) rates were compared. Median follow-up was 63 months for the LE group and 59 months for the TME group. Twenty-three LE patients (49%) had a complete response to CXRT, 17 (36%) had microscopic residual disease, and 7 (15%) had gross residual disease, compared with 108 (23%), 89 (19%), and 276 (58%) TME patients, respectively. There was no significant difference between the 10-year actuarial local recurrence rate for the LE group versus the TME group (10.6% and 7.6%, respectively; P = .52), and no significant difference in DFS, disease-specific survival, or OS rates between groups.

Clinical significance of acellular mucin in rectal adenocarcinoma patients with a pathologic complete response to preoperative chemoradiation.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2010-02-01,"The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and prognostic significance of acellular mucin within resected specimens of rectal cancer patients with a pCR following preoperative chemoradiation. The presence of acellular mucin pools in the resected specimens of patients with a complete response to preoperative chemoradiation is frequently reported as a marker of treatment effect. The clinical significance of the presence of acellular mucin with respect to local recurrence and survival outcomes is unknown. Data from a rectal cancer database was used to analyze 562 patients with nonmetastatic rectal adenocarcinoma treated between 1989 and 2004. The presence or absence of acellular mucin within the specimen was identified by the surgical pathology reports and confirmed by re-examination of H&E sections of surgical specimens. Among the 562 patients, 100 patients (18%) had pCR. Acellular mucin was present in 27 (27%) of the 100 patients with pCR. The median follow-up interval was 87 months (range, 1-198 months). Local and distant failures occurred in 0 and 2 patients with acellular mucin, and in 1 and 6 patients without acellular mucin, respectively. The actuarial 7-year overall survival rates were 85% for patients with acellular mucin and 92% for patients without acellular mucin (P = 0.954).

Prostate cancer invading the rectum: a clinicopathological study of 18 cases.,Pathology,Pathology,2009-01-01,"Prostate cancer may involve the rectum and cause severe perineal pain. The aim of this study was to understand the rectal involvement by prostate cancer and its clinical significance. We evaluated pathological and clinical features of 18 cases of prostate cancer with rectal involvement. All patients presented with intractable perineal pain. Twelve patients received rectal biopsies, which revealed poorly differentiated prostatic adenocarcinoma (n = 6), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 3), angiosarcoma (n = 1), or no tumour (n = 2). All patients received palliative total pelvic exenteration, which demonstrated prostate cancer invading the rectal wall. In these resection specimens, the tumour consisted of poorly differentiated prostatic adenocarcinoma (n = 16), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 1), or angiosarcoma (n = 1). In addition, six cases of prostatic adenocarcinomas also showed focal squamous (n = 3) or high-grade neuroendocrine (n = 3) differentiation. Nine patients died at a mean time of 18 months (range, 2-69 months) after surgery.

Clin. Oncol.,2009-11-30,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) Trap (aflibercept) is an angiogenesis inhibitor comprising portions of the extracellular domains of human VEGF receptors 1 and 2 fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G. This phase I study was designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of VEGF Trap administered intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks. Patients with refractory solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with adequate organ function were eligible. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic markers included measurement of plasma VEGF bound to VEGF Trap and free VEGF Trap. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) was incorporated to measure the biologic effects of the drug on tumor vascularity and permeability. The study enrolled 47 patients at doses ranging from 0.3 to 7.0 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks. Dose-limiting toxicities were rectal ulceration and proteinuria at the 7.0 mg/kg dose. Other mechanism-specific toxicities included hypertension. On the basis of these observations and on pharmacokinetics, the recommended phase II dose of VEGF Trap as a single agent is 4 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Three RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) -defined partial responses were observed, one at the 3.0 mg/kg and two at the 7.0 mg/kg dose level. Maximum plasma concentration of free VEGF Trap increased proportionally with dose. Maximal VEGF-bound VEGF Trap complex levels were reached at doses > or = 2.0 mg/kg. Changes in volume transfer constant measured by DCE-MRI at baseline and at 24 hours after administration indicate a possible dose-related change in this pharmacodynamic marker. IV VEGF Trap was well tolerated at the dose levels tested.

An update on laparoscopic resection for rectal cancer.,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,Cancer Control,2010-01-01,"In the current age of minimally invasive surgery, laparoscopic surgery for colon cancer has been established as oncologically equivalent to conventional open surgery. The advantages of laparoscopic surgery have translated into smaller incisions and shorter recovery. However, the narrow confines of the bony pelvis and angling limits in current stapling technology, along with the standard practice of autonomic nerve-sparing total mesorectal excision, have made laparoscopic surgery in the setting of rectal cancer more challenging. The available literature focusing on laparoscopic resection for rectal cancer has been predominantly retrospective in nature, with a limited number of prospective studies. This article discusses the current status of laparoscopic rectal cancer resection. A review of the more recent retrospective and prospective data specifically on laparoscopic resection for mid to low rectal cancer was performed. The number of prospective randomized trials addressing laparoscopic rectal cancer resection is limited. In the largest trial (MRC CLASICC), an initial increased rate of positive circumferential margins within the laparoscopic anterior resection cohort, although nonsignificant, raised concerns regarding its oncologic adequacy. These concerns did not translate into a difference in local recurrence at 3 years. Improved short-term outcomes, including quicker recovery times, shorter hospital stays, and reduced analgesic requirements (albeit at the price of longer operative times and higher overall cost), have been demonstrated in some studies.

Radiation therapy for rectal cancer: current status and future directions.,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,Cancer Control,2010-01-01,"Treatment for rectal cancer has evolved over the past 70 years from surgery alone to the selective use of trimodality therapy for high-risk patients. Radiotherapy (RT) has improved the potential for tumor downstaging, thus enhancing sphincter preservation and local control. This article reviews the evolution of strategies that incorporate pelvic RT, intraoperative RT, and high-dose-rate endorectal brachytherapy (HDRBT). By tracing the arc of the pendulum that has swung from postoperative RT to preoperative RT, we address the current standard of care and explore the potential of novel radiation techniques and radiosensitizing agents to improve outcomes. With randomized trial data confirming that preoperative RT in addition to chemotherapy improves local control and decreases acute and late morbidity, neoadjuvant programs have now demonstrated the prognostic significance of downstaging as well. Patients with tumors that have a good response to preoperative treatment have superior survival. Future studies will determine the optimal regimen to enhance the pathologic complete or near complete response rates for locally advanced disease. Advances in radiation technology are being investigated to determine whether efficacy can be increased and toxicity decreased so that more aggressive chemotherapeutic agents can be combined.

Development of prototype shielded cervical intracavitary brachytherapy applicators compatible with CT and MR imaging.,Medical physics,Med Phys,2009-12-01,"Intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) is an integral part of the treatment regimen for cervical cancer and, generally, outcome in terms of local disease control and complications is a function of dose to the disease bed and critical structures, respectively. Therefore, it is paramount to accurately determine the dose given via ICBT to the tumor bed as well as critical structures. This is greatly facilitated through the use of advanced three-dimensional imaging modalities, such as CT and MR, to delineate critical and target structures with an ICBT applicator inserted in vivo. These methods are not possible when using a shielded applicator due to the image artifacts generated by interovoid shielding. The authors present two prototype shielded ICBT applicators that can be utilized for artifact-free CT image acquisition. They also investigate the MR amenability and dosimetry of a novel tungsten-alloy shielding material to extend the functionality of these devices. To accomplish artifact-free CT image acquisition, a ""step-and-shoot"" (S&S) methodology was utilized, which exploits the prototype applicators movable interovoid shielding. Both prototypes were placed in imaging phantoms that positioned the applicators in clinically applicable orientations. CT image sets were acquired of the prototype applicators as well as a shielded Fletcher-Williamson (sFW) ovoid. Artifacts present in each CT image set were qualitatively compared for each prototype applicator following the S&S methodology and the sFW. To test the novel tungsten-alloy shielding material's MR amenability, they constructed a phantom applicator that mimics the basic components of an ICBT ovoid. This phantom applicator positions the MR-compatible shields in orientations equivalent to the sFW bladder and rectal shields. MR images were acquired within a gadopentetate dimeglumine-doped water tank using standard pulse sequences and examined for artifacts. In addition, Monte Carlo simulations were performed to match the attenuation due to the thickness of this new shield type with current, clinically utilized ovoid shields and a 192Ir HDR/PDR source. Artifact-free CT images could be acquired of both generation applicators in a clinically applicable geometry using the S&S method. MR images were acquired of the phantom applicator containing shields, which contained minimal, clinically relevant artifacts. The thickness required to match the dosimetry of the MR-compatible and sFW rectal shields was determined using Monte Carlo simulations. Utilizing a S&S imaging method in conjunction with prototype applicators that feature movable interovoid shields, they were able to acquire artifact-free CT image sets in a clinically applicable geometry. MR images were acquired of a phantom applicator that contained shields composed of a novel tungsten alloy. Artifacts were largely limited to regions within the ovoid cap and are of no clinical interest.

Patient-reported acute gastrointestinal symptoms during concurrent chemoradiation treatment for rectal cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-04-01,"Although it is known that standard 5-fluorouracil-based chemoradiation therapy for rectal cancer causes significant acute gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, research on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) is limited. The authors undertook the current study to assess the feasibility of incorporating PRO measurement into routine clinical practice and to describe the trajectory of symptom development during treatment. Seventy-seven consecutive patients who were treated between 2006 and 2008 were eligible. Patients completed the 7-item Bowel Problems Scale immediately before weekly physician visits. The questionnaire completion rate was 95%. Individual GI symptoms had different trajectories of development. By Week 5, approximately 40% of all patients developed clinically meaningful pain, bowel urgency, or tenesmus that was not present during Week 1; 30% developed diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and passing mucus. However, overall symptom burden was moderate. Seventy-five percent of patients who presented with rectal bleeding at Week 1 improved by Week 3 of treatment. Within each physician-assessed grade of diarrhea, patient experience varied widely.

Clinical toxicities and dosimetric parameters after whole-pelvis versus prostate-only intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int.

Rectal dose-volume histogram parameters are associated with long-term patient-reported gastrointestinal quality of life after conventional and high-dose radiation for prostate cancer: a subgroup analysis of a randomized trial.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int.

Impact of anatomical interventions on the localization of post-prostatectomy cancer patients.,Medical physics,Med Phys,2010-02-01,"Anatomical deformations of prostate-bed, rectum, and bladder can compromise the targeting accuracy in post-prostatectomy cancer patients. In this work, the impact of anatomical interventions on the localization data from post-prostatectomy patients who received image-guided IMRT was analyzed. Patients were localized daily with online kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography (kV-CBCT). The target and the organs at risk (OARs) positional and volumetric changes were evaluated and couch shifts were applied. For patients with large target or OAR volumetric changes, quantified by either a rectal or bladder wall displacement of >5 mm on the CBCT sagittal images compared to the planning CT, repeated localization CBCT scans were performed following an interventional procedure. The procedure involves insertion of a catheter to deflate the rectum, evacuation of stools, and/or adjustment of bladder filling. The required shifts were then evaluated, and the IMRT treatment was subsequently delivered after proper patient positioning. The pre- and post-intervention shifts were compared in the lateral [left-right (LR)], longitudinal [superior-inferior (SI)], and vertical [anterior-posterior (AP)] directions. The percentage of shifts larger than 5 mm in all directions was also compared. Clinical target volume to planning target volume (CTV-to-PTV) expansion margins were estimated based on the pre- and post-intervention localization data. Intervention was performed on all patients (n=17) treated between October 2008 and March 2009. The number of interventions ranged from 2 to 12 with a median number of 5, resulting in a total of 96 pairs of pre- and post-intervention shifts. The mean value (sigma) and standard deviation (sigma) of the shifts from pre- versus post-intervention data were LR, 0.0 +/- 3.0 mm vs. 0.5 +/- 2.8 mm; SI, 0.2 +/- 3.1 mm vs. -1.0 +/- 2.1 mm; and AP, -2.6 +/- 5.8 mm vs. 1.7 +/- 3.9 mm. The mean 3D shift distance was 7.0 +/- 3.1 mm vs. 5.0 +/- 2.6 mm. The percentage of pre-intervention shifts larger than 5 mm were 7%, 7%, and 45% in the LR, SI, and AP directions, respectively, compared to 8%, 4%, and 21% for post-intervention. Localization data from pre- and post-intervention procedures suggest that treatments that do not include intervention to correct for rectum/bladder anatomical variations require an additional 3.3 mm CTV-to-PTV margin.

Colorectal cancer.,"Lancet (London, England)",Lancet,2010-03-01,"Substantial progress has been made in colorectal cancer in the past decade. Screening, used to identify individuals at an early stage, has improved outcome. There is greater understanding of the genetic basis of inherited colorectal cancer and identification of patients at risk. Optimisation of surgery for patients with localised disease has had a major effect on survival at 5 years and 10 years. For rectal cancer, identification of patients at greatest risk of local failure is important in the selection of patients for preoperative chemoradiation, a strategy proven to improve outcomes in these patients. Stringent postoperative follow-up helps the early identification of potentially radically treatable oligometastatic disease and improves long-term survival. Treatment with adjuvant fluoropyrimidine for colon and rectal cancers further improves survival, more so in stage III than in stage II disease, and oxaliplatin-based combination chemotherapy is now routinely used for stage III disease, although efficacy must be carefully balanced against toxicity. In stage II disease, molecular markers such as microsatellite instability might help select patients for treatment. The integration of targeted treatments with conventional cytotoxic drugs has expanded the treatment of metastatic disease resulting in incremental survival gains. However, biomarker development is essential to aid selection of patients likely to respond to therapy, thereby rationalising treatments and improving outcomes.",Journal Article,3613.0,1051.0,Substantial progress has been made in cancer in the past decade Screening used to identify individuals at an early stage has improved outcome There is greater understanding of the genetic basis of inherited cancer and identification of patients at risk Optimisation of surgery for patients with localised disease has had a major effect on survival at 5 years and 10 years For cancer identification of patients at greatest risk of local failure is important in the selection of patients for preoperative chemoradiation a strategy proven to improve outcomes in these patients Stringent postoperative follow-up helps the early identification of potentially radically treatable oligometastatic disease and improves long-term survival Treatment with adjuvant fluoropyrimidine for and cancers further improves survival more so in stage III than in stage II disease and oxaliplatin-based combination chemotherapy is now routinely used for stage III disease although efficacy must be carefully balanced against toxicity In stage II disease molecular markers such as microsatellite instability might help select patients for treatment The integration of targeted treatments with conventional cytotoxic drugs has expanded the treatment of metastatic disease resulting in incremental survival gains However biomarker development is essential to aid selection of patients likely to respond to therapy thereby rationalising treatments and improving outcomes,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[1281, 1466, 71, 85, 1229, 4, 12, 4, 3, 1219, 2025, 453, 95, 6, 255, 869, 28, 35, 191, 82, 71, 231, 228, 125, 16, 378, 612, 1, 3, 336, 877, 1, 2986, 12, 2, 911, 1, 7, 28, 43, 25059, 1, 152, 9, 7, 5, 9581, 34, 71, 42, 8, 458, 254, 23, 25, 28, 33, 60, 2, 79, 60, 9, 12, 911, 1, 7, 28, 2199, 43, 1, 293, 496, 16, 305, 4, 3, 881, 1, 7, 9, 498, 975, 8, 692, 1930, 6, 401, 123, 4, 46, 7, 6763, 573, 166, 126, 6484, 3, 191, 911, 1, 751, 15604, 9437, 4101, 34, 2, 1804, 319, 337, 25, 24, 5, 249, 5464, 9, 2, 163, 195, 1804, 25, 80, 1743, 4, 82, 316, 76, 4, 82, 215, 34, 2, 1476, 90, 150, 56, 16, 1134, 3066, 95, 9, 82, 316, 34, 242, 209, 1642, 40, 3900, 4115, 480, 155, 4, 82, 215, 34, 219, 525, 225, 22, 2226, 1753, 822, 987, 1717, 7, 9, 24, 3, 2676, 1, 238, 640, 5, 809, 759, 600, 71, 2064, 3, 24, 1, 113, 34, 1113, 4, 3648, 25, 3849, 137, 901, 193, 16, 1452, 6, 2427, 881, 1, 7, 322, 6, 1892, 6, 36, 2267, 58759, 640, 2, 1673, 123]",1444.0,20304247,465
Prospective randomized double-blind pilot study of site-specific consensus atlas implementation for rectal cancer target volume delineation in the cooperative group setting.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2010-04-18,"Variations in target volume delineation represent a significant hurdle in clinical trials involving conformal radiotherapy. We sought to determine the effect of a consensus guideline-based visual atlas on contouring the target volumes. A representative case was contoured (Scan 1) by 14 physician observers and a reference expert with and without target volume delineation instructions derived from a proposed rectal cancer clinical trial involving conformal radiotherapy. The gross tumor volume (GTV), and two clinical target volumes (CTVA, including the internal iliac, presacral, and perirectal nodes, and CTVB, which included the external iliac nodes) were contoured. The observers were randomly assigned to receipt (Group A) or nonreceipt (Group B) of a consensus guideline and atlas for anorectal cancers and then instructed to recontour the same case/images (Scan 2). Observer variation was analyzed volumetrically using the conformation number (CN, where CN = 1 equals total agreement). Of 14 evaluable contour sets (1 expert and 7 Group A and 6 Group B observers), greater agreement was found for the GTV (mean CN, 0.75) than for the CTVs (mean CN, 0.46-0.65). Atlas exposure for Group A led to significantly increased interobserver agreement for CTVA (mean initial CN, 0.68, after atlas use, 0.76; p = .03) and increased agreement with the expert reference (initial mean CN, 0.58; after atlas use, 0.69; p = .02). For the GTV and CTVB, neither the interobserver nor the expert agreement was altered after atlas exposure. Consensus guideline atlas implementation resulted in a detectable difference in interobserver agreement and a greater approximation of expert volumes for the CTVA but not for the GTV or CTVB in the specified case.

"A four-kallikrein panel predicts prostate cancer in men with recent screening: data from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer, Rotterdam.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2010-04-16,"We have developed a statistical prediction model for prostate cancer based on four kallikrein markers in blood: total, free, and intact prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and kallikrein-related peptidase 2 (hK2). Although this model accurately predicts the result of biopsy in unscreened men, its properties for men with a history of PSA screening have not been fully characterized. A total of 1,501 previously screened men with elevated PSA underwent initial biopsy during rounds 2 and 3 of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer, Rotterdam, with 388 cancers diagnosed. Biomarker levels were measured in serum samples taken before biopsy. The prediction model developed on the unscreened cohort was then applied and predictions compared with biopsy outcome. The previously developed four-kallikrein prediction model had much higher predictive accuracy than PSA and age alone (area under the curve of 0.711 versus 0.585, and 0.713 versus 0.557 with and without digital rectal exam, respectively; both P < 0.001). Similar statistically significant enhancements were seen for high-grade cancer. Applying the model with a cutoff of 20% cancer risk as the criterion for biopsy would reduce the biopsy rate by 362 for every 1,000 men with elevated PSA.

Reducing unnecessary biopsy during prostate cancer screening using a four-kallikrein panel: an independent replication.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2010-04-26,"We previously reported that a panel of four kallikrein forms in blood-total, free, and intact prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and kallikrein-related peptidase 2 (hK2)-can reduce unnecessary biopsy in previously unscreened men with elevated total PSA. We aimed to replicate our findings in a large, independent, representative, population-based cohort. The study cohort included 2,914 previously unscreened men undergoing biopsy as a result of elevated PSA (> or = 3 ng/mL) in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer, Rotterdam, with 807 prostate cancers (28%) detected. The cohort was randomly divided 1:3 into a training and validation set. Levels of kallikrein markers were compared with biopsy outcome. Addition of free PSA, intact PSA, and hK2 to a model containing total PSA and age improved the area under the curve from 0.64 to 0.76 and 0.70 to 0.78 for models without and with digital rectal examination results, respectively (P < .001 for both). Application of the panel to 1,000 men with elevated PSA would reduce the number of biopsies by 513 and miss 54 of 177 low-grade cancers and 12 of 100 high-grade cancers. Findings were robust to sensitivity analysis. We have replicated our previously published finding that a panel of four kallikreins can predict the result of biopsy for prostate cancer in men with elevated PSA.

Clinical and pathologic factors that predict lymph node yield from surgical specimens in colorectal cancer: a population-based study.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-06-01,"The National Quality Forum endorses the recommendation of examining at least 12 lymph nodes (LNs) from colorectal cancer (CRC) specimens. However, heterogeneity in LN harvest exists. The objective of this study was to investigate the clinicopathologic factors that influence LN yield. The authors used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database to identify patients who were diagnosed with stage I, II, and III CRC between 1994 and 2005. Poisson regression was used to model the number of LNs examined as a function of individual clinicopathologic factors, including age, sex, race, year of diagnosis, geographic region, anatomic site, preoperative radiation, tumor size, tumor classification, tumor differentiation, and LN positivity. In total, 153,483 patients with CRC were identified. The mean number of LNs examined (+/- standard deviation) was 12 (+/-9.3). Separate multivariate analyses revealed that age, year of diagnosis, tumor size, and tumor classification were significant predictors of LN yield for colon and extraperitoneal rectal cancers (P < .01 for all covariates).

The role of targeted agents in preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-08-01,"In the United States, randomized trials have established preoperative chemoradiation as the standard of care for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Pathologic complete response (pCR) rates occur in 10% to 16% of patients and have been shown to be correlated with both disease-free and overall survival. Therefore, recent efforts incorporating newer cytotoxic and molecularly targeted agents into chemoradiotherapy regimens have reported the pCR rate to be a surrogate marker of clinical outcomes. Substitution of oral fluoropyrimidines, including capecitabine, for infusional 5-fluorouracil reportedly generated pCR rates of up to 32% in phase 2 studies, but definitive evaluation awaits results from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) R-04 trial. Similarly, regimens incorporating irinotecan generated pCR rates as high as 38%, but to the authors' knowledge have not been evaluated in randomized trials. In contrast, 2 large randomized trials reported that the addition of weekly oxaliplatin to fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiation led to an increase in grade 3/4 toxicity but no difference in pCR rates. Early phase trials evaluating the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody cetuximab in combination with chemoradiation reported modest pCR rates of 5% to 12%, and efforts have focused on identifying biomarkers of response including EGFR copy number, k-ras mutational status, and both serum and tumor-specific expression of EGFR ligands. Finally, incorporation of the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody bevacizumab into chemoradiation appears to be safe and feasible, with initial studies reporting a beneficial effect on vascular normalization and correlations between circulating biomarkers of angiogenesis and pathologic response. Future efforts should include prospective studies of these agents in biomarker-defined subpopulations, as well as studies of novel agents that target angiogenesis, tumor-stromal interaction, and the cell signaling pathways implicated in colorectal cancer.",Journal Article,3460.0,24.0,In the United States randomized trials have established preoperative chemoradiation as the standard of care for patients with locally advanced cancer Pathologic complete response pCR rates occur in 10 to 16 of patients and have been shown to be correlated with both disease-free and overall survival Therefore recent efforts incorporating newer cytotoxic and molecularly targeted agents into chemoradiotherapy regimens have reported the pCR rate to be a surrogate marker of clinical outcomes Substitution of oral fluoropyrimidines including capecitabine for infusional 5-fluorouracil reportedly generated pCR rates of up to 32 in phase 2 studies but definitive evaluation awaits results from the National Surgical Adjuvant and Bowel Project NSABP R-04 trial Similarly regimens incorporating irinotecan generated pCR rates as high as 38 but to the authors knowledge have not been evaluated in randomized trials In contrast 2 large randomized trials reported that the addition of weekly oxaliplatin to fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiation led to an increase in grade 3/4 toxicity but no difference in pCR rates Early phase trials evaluating the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR antibody cetuximab in combination with chemoradiation reported modest pCR rates of 5 to 12 and efforts have focused on identifying biomarkers of response including EGFR copy number k-ras mutational status and both serum and tumor-specific expression of EGFR ligands Finally incorporation of the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody bevacizumab into chemoradiation appears to be safe and feasible with initial studies reporting a beneficial effect on vascular normalization and correlations between circulating biomarkers of angiogenesis and pathologic response Future efforts should include prospective studies of these agents in biomarker-defined subpopulations as well as studies of novel agents that target angiogenesis tumor-stromal interaction and the cell signaling pathways implicated in cancer,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[4, 3, 1088, 907, 384, 143, 47, 635, 498, 975, 22, 3, 260, 1, 165, 9, 7, 5, 795, 131, 12, 510, 236, 51, 604, 151, 1271, 4, 79, 6, 245, 1, 7, 2, 47, 85, 443, 6, 40, 438, 5, 110, 34, 115, 2, 63, 25, 673, 435, 1413, 2570, 2246, 759, 2, 2372, 238, 183, 237, 1464, 472, 47, 210, 3, 604, 116, 6, 40, 8, 2592, 952, 1, 38, 123, 5029, 1, 518, 10330, 141, 1629, 9, 4825, 33, 1404, 11238, 1419, 604, 151, 1, 126, 6, 531, 4, 124, 18, 94, 84, 1057, 451, 15462, 99, 29, 3, 657, 221, 249, 2, 1659, 3105, 8449, 668, 755, 160, 1813, 472, 2570, 1071, 1419, 604, 151, 22, 64, 22, 519, 84, 6, 3, 738, 922, 47, 44, 85, 194, 4, 384, 143, 4, 748, 18, 375, 384, 143, 210, 17, 3, 352, 1, 709, 1476, 6, 5464, 90, 975, 836, 6, 35, 344, 4, 88, 27, 39, 155, 84, 77, 523, 4, 604, 151, 191, 124, 143, 1435, 3, 312, 829, 129, 161, 153, 227, 548, 1175, 4, 150, 5, 975, 210, 1721, 604, 151, 1, 33, 6, 133, 2, 1413, 47, 1649, 23, 1386, 582, 1, 51, 141, 227, 1337, 207, 1634, 1102, 1619, 156, 2, 110, 524, 2, 30, 112, 55, 1, 227, 3123, 1368, 2838, 1, 3, 312, 756, 845, 129, 161, 548, 599, 237, 975, 1233, 6, 40, 1165, 2, 1313, 5, 388, 94, 1760, 8, 2524, 254, 23, 756, 5924, 2, 2553, 59, 1033, 582, 1, 1056, 2, 510, 51, 508, 1413, 257, 643, 482, 94, 1, 46, 183, 4, 901, 395, 4847, 22, 149, 22, 94, 1, 229, 183, 17, 283, 1056, 30, 1126, 915, 2, 3, 31, 314, 460, 1771, 4, 12]",2000.0,20564106,290

Effects of obesity in rectal cancer surgery.,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,J. Am. Coll. Surg.,2010-05-15,"Increased local recurrence after total mesorectal excision (TME) in obese rectal cancer patients has been attributed to technical difficulties associated with adiposity. In this study, we evaluate whether higher body mass index (BMI) compromises surgical resection in patients with locally advanced, mid-to-low rectal cancer after neoadjuvant therapy, adversely affecting long-term oncologic outcomes. Five-hundred and ninety-six patients with uT3/4 and/or uN1 rectal adenocarcinoma were treated from 1998 to 2007 with neoadjuvant therapy, followed by radical resection using TME. Outcomes were analyzed according to BMI: obese (BMI >or=30) and nonobese (BMI <30). Median follow-up was 39 months. In all, 26.7% of patients were obese. The rate for positive circumferential margin in nonobese was 4.9% versus 2.5% in obese (p = 0.21). The sphincter-sparing rate in nonobese was 79.5% versus 80.5% in obese (p = 0.77). Five-year overall survival for nonobese was 84% versus 90% for obese (p = 0.92). Five-year disease-free survival for nonobese was 76% versus 73% for obese (p = 0.75). Operative time was longer in obese than nonobese; 4.3 versus 3.7 hours, respectively (p < 0.01). Length of stay was longer in obese than nonobese; 8 versus 7 days, respectively (p < 0.01). Similar results were obtained in analysis stratified by gender.

Dosimetric effect of online image-guided anatomical interventions for postprostatectomy cancer patients.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2010-07-17,"To assess daily variations in delivered doses in postprostatectomy patients, using kilovoltage cone-beam CT (CBCT) datasets acquired before and after interventions to correct for observed distortions in volume/shape of rectum and bladder. Seventeen consecutive patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy to the prostate bed were studied. For patients with large anatomical variations, quantified by either a rectal wall displacement of >5 mm or bladder volume change of >50% on the CBCT compared with the planning CT, an intervention was performed to adjust the rectum and/or bladder filling. Cumulative doses over the pre- and post-intervention fractions were calculated by tracking the position of the planning CT voxels on different CBCTs using a deformable surface-mapping algorithm. Dose and displacements vectors were projected on two-dimensional maps, the minimal dose received by the highest 95% of the planing target volume (PTV D95) and the highest 10% of the rectum volume (D10) as well as the bladder volume receiving >2 Gy (V2) were evaluated. Of 544 fractions, 96 required intervention. Median (range) number of interventions per patient was 5 (2-12). Compared with the planning values, the mean (SD) pre- vs. postintervention value for PTV D95 was -2% (2%) vs. -1% (2%) (p < 0.12), for rectum D10 was -1% (4%) vs. +1% (4%) (p < 0.24), and for bladder V2 was +6% vs. +20% (p < 0.84).

The NANETS consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors (nets): well-differentiated nets of the distal colon and rectum.,Pancreas,Pancreas,2010-08-01,"Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the distal colon and rectum are also known as hindgut carcinoids based on their common embryologic derivation. Their annual incidence in the United States is rising, primarily as a result of increased incidental detection. Symptoms of rectal NETs include hematochezia, pain, and change in bowel habits. Most rectal NETs are small, submucosal in location, and associated with a very low malignant potential. Tumors larger than 2 cm or those invading the muscularis propria are associated with a significantly higher risk of metastatic spread. Colonic NETs proximal to the rectum are rarer and tend to behave more aggressively. The incidence of rectal NETs in African Americans and Asians is substantially higher than in Caucasians. Colorectal NETs are generally not associated with a hormonal syndrome such as flushing or diarrhea.

Long-term outcome in patients with a pathological complete response after chemoradiation for rectal cancer: a pooled analysis of individual patient data.,The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2010-08-06,"Locally advanced rectal cancer is usually treated with preoperative chemoradiation. After chemoradiation and surgery, 15-27% of the patients have no residual viable tumour at pathological examination, a pathological complete response (pCR). This study established whether patients with pCR have better long-term outcome than do those without pCR. In PubMed, Medline, and Embase we identified 27 articles, based on 17 different datasets, for long-term outcome of patients with and without pCR. 14 investigators agreed to provide individual patient data. All patients underwent chemoradiation and total mesorectal excision. Primary outcome was 5-year disease-free survival. Kaplan-Meier survival functions were computed and hazard ratios (HRs) calculated, with the Cox proportional hazards model. Subgroup analyses were done to test for effect modification by other predicting factors. Interstudy heterogeneity was assessed for disease-free survival and overall survival with forest plots and the Q test. 484 of 3105 included patients had a pCR. Median follow-up for all patients was 48 months (range 0-277). 5-year crude disease-free survival was 83.3% (95% CI 78.8-87.0) for patients with pCR (61/419 patients had disease recurrence) and 65.6% (63.6-68.0) for those without pCR (747/2263; HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.34-0.57; p<0.0001). The Q test and forest plots did not suggest significant interstudy variation. The adjusted HR for pCR for failure was 0.54 (95% CI 0.40-0.73), indicating that patients with pCR had a significantly increased probability of disease-free survival. The adjusted HR for disease-free survival for administration of adjuvant chemotherapy was 0.91 (95% CI 0.73-1.12).

A Phase 1 study of UCN-01 in combination with irinotecan in patients with resistant solid tumor malignancies.,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol.,2010-08-08,"UCN-01 (7-hydroxystaurosporine) is a multi-targeted protein kinase inhibitor that exhibits synergistic activity with DNA-damaging agents in preclinical studies. We conducted a Phase I study to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic effects of UCN-01 and irinotecan in patients with resistant solid tumors. Patients received irinotecan (75-125 mg/m(2) IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22) and UCN-01 (50-90 mg/m(2) IV on day 2 and 25-45 mg/m(2) on day 23 and subsequent doses) every 42 days. Blood for pharmacokinetics of UCN-01 and irinotecan, and blood, normal rectal mucosa, and tumor biopsies for pharmacodynamic studies were obtained. Twenty-five patients enrolled to 5 dose levels. The MTD was irinotecan 125 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, 15, 22 and UCN-01 70 mg/m(2) on day 2 and 35 mg/m(2) on day 23. DLTs included grade 3 diarrhea/dehydration and dyspnea. UCN-01 had a prolonged half-life and a low clearance rate. There was a significant reduction in SN-38 C(max) and aminopentanocarboxylic acid (APC) and SN-38 glucuronide half-lives. Phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 was reduced in blood, normal rectal mucosa, and tumor biopsies at 24 h post-UCN-01. Two partial responses were observed in women with ER, PgR, and HER2-negative breast cancers (TBNC). Both tumors were defective for p53. Twelve patients had stable disease (mean duration 18 weeks, range 7-30 weeks). UCN-01 and irinotecan demonstrated acceptable toxicity and target inhibition. Anti-tumor activity was observed and a study of this combination in women with TNBC is underway.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",3453.0,40.0,UCN-01 7-hydroxystaurosporine is a multi-targeted protein kinase inhibitor that exhibits synergistic activity with DNA-damaging agents in preclinical studies We conducted a Phase I study to determine the maximum-tolerated dose MTD dose-limiting toxicity DLT pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of UCN-01 and irinotecan in patients with resistant solid tumors Patients received irinotecan 75-125 mg/m 2 IV on days 1 8 15 22 and UCN-01 50-90 mg/m 2 IV on day 2 and 25-45 mg/m 2 on day 23 and subsequent doses every 42 days Blood for pharmacokinetics of UCN-01 and irinotecan and blood normal mucosa and tumor biopsies for pharmacodynamic studies were obtained Twenty-five patients enrolled to 5 dose levels The MTD was irinotecan 125 mg/m 2 on days 1 8 15 22 and UCN-01 70 mg/m 2 on day 2 and 35 mg/m 2 on day 23 DLTs included grade 3 diarrhea/dehydration and dyspnea UCN-01 had a prolonged half-life and a low clearance rate There was a significant reduction in SN-38 C max and aminopentanocarboxylic acid APC and SN-38 glucuronide half-lives Phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 was reduced in blood normal mucosa and tumor biopsies at 24 h post-UCN-01 Two partial responses were observed in women with ER PgR and HER2-negative cancers TBNC Both tumors were defective for p53 Twelve patients had stable disease mean duration 18 weeks range 7-30 weeks UCN-01 and irinotecan demonstrated acceptable toxicity and target inhibition Anti-tumor activity was observed and a study of this combination in women with TNBC is underway,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[4582, 355, 67, 21100, 16, 8, 1414, 238, 178, 216, 230, 17, 4273, 1806, 128, 5, 261, 4904, 183, 4, 693, 94, 21, 426, 8, 124, 70, 45, 6, 223, 3, 689, 421, 61, 961, 61, 817, 155, 2059, 1456, 2, 2424, 176, 1, 4582, 355, 2, 1071, 4, 7, 5, 436, 537, 57, 7, 103, 1071, 481, 1731, 81, 188, 18, 478, 23, 162, 14, 66, 167, 350, 2, 4582, 355, 212, 424, 81, 188, 18, 478, 23, 218, 18, 2, 243, 512, 81, 188, 18, 23, 218, 382, 2, 706, 415, 454, 595, 162, 315, 9, 1159, 1, 4582, 355, 2, 1071, 2, 315, 295, 2713, 2, 30, 1154, 9, 2424, 94, 11, 683, 737, 365, 7, 346, 6, 33, 61, 148, 3, 961, 10, 1071, 1731, 81, 188, 18, 23, 162, 14, 66, 167, 350, 2, 4582, 355, 431, 81, 188, 18, 23, 218, 18, 2, 465, 81, 188, 18, 23, 218, 382, 2506, 159, 88, 27, 1172, 5414, 2, 2923, 4582, 355, 42, 8, 1069, 1303, 358, 2, 8, 154, 1960, 116, 125, 10, 8, 93, 628, 4, 3133, 519, 256, 2649, 2, 59235, 971, 2528, 2, 3133, 519, 11435, 1303, 6407, 2365, 8194, 178, 4977, 10, 405, 4, 315, 295, 2713, 2, 30, 1154, 28, 259, 555, 539, 4582, 355, 100, 450, 253, 11, 164, 4, 117, 5, 516, 6032, 2, 354, 199, 163, 46164, 110, 57, 11, 4552, 9, 624, 2544, 7, 42, 585, 34, 313, 654, 203, 244, 184, 67, 201, 244, 4582, 355, 2, 1071, 264, 1595, 155, 2, 283, 297, 312, 30, 128, 10, 164, 2, 8, 45, 1, 26, 150, 4, 117, 5, 1403, 16, 3948]",1530.0,20694727,177
Variation in use of surveillance colonoscopy among colorectal cancer survivors in the United States.,BMC health services research,BMC Health Serv Res,2010-09-01,"Clinical practice guidelines recommend colonoscopies at regular intervals for colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors. Using data from a large, multi-regional, population-based cohort, we describe the rate of surveillance colonoscopy and its association with geographic, sociodemographic, clinical, and health services characteristics. We studied CRC survivors enrolled in the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS) study. Eligible survivors were diagnosed between 2003 and 2005, had curative surgery for CRC, and were alive without recurrences 14 months after surgery with curative intent. Data came from patient interviews and medical record abstraction. We used a multivariate logit model to identify predictors of colonoscopy use. Despite guidelines recommending surveillance, only 49% of the 1423 eligible survivors received a colonoscopy within 14 months after surgery. We observed large regional differences (38% to 57%) across regions. Survivors who received screening colonoscopy were more likely to: have colon cancer than rectal cancer (OR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.05-1.90); have visited a primary care physician (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.14-1.82); and received adjuvant chemotherapy (OR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.27-2.41). Compared to survivors with no comorbidities, survivors with moderate or severe comorbidities were less likely to receive surveillance colonoscopy (OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.49-0.98 and OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.29-0.66, respectively). Despite guidelines, more than half of CRC survivors did not receive surveillance colonoscopy within 14 months of surgery, with substantial variation by site of care.

Close distal margin and rectal cancer recurrence after sphincter-preserving rectal resection.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2010-10-01,"Negative surgical margins are important for local control of rectal cancer treated with sphincter-preserving surgery. However, the association of rectal cancer recurrence with close distal margin is not well established. Data were extracted from a prospective database of patients collected between 1991 and 2003. Included were 627 patients who underwent curative low anterior resection with total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer 2 to 12 cm from the anal verge. Three hundred ninety-nine patients received neoadjuvant therapy, 65 received postoperative adjuvant therapy alone, and 163 were treated with surgery alone. Median follow-up was 5.8 years. On multivariable analysis, overall recurrence was associated with pathologic stage, lymphovascular invasion, and distal margin. Mucosal recurrence was uncommon; only 16 events were recorded, and of those only 8 were at the initial site of isolated tumor recurrence; 7 of the 8 were surgically salvaged. On univariable analysis, mucosal recurrence was associated with close distal margin (5 vs 2% at 5 y) and lymphovascular invasion (7 vs 2%). Pelvic recurrence, other than isolated mucosal recurrence, was associated with distal location (6 vs 4% at 5 y) and lymphovascular invasion (11 vs 4%).

However, numerous molecular alterations have been associated with clinical outcome, and potentially confounding the biological and prognostic significance of tumour-infiltrating T-cells. We utilized a database of clinically and molecularly-annotated colon and rectal carcinoma cases (N = 768; stage I-IV) in two prospective cohort studies (the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study) and quantified the densities of CD3(+), CD8(+), CD45RO(+) (PTPRC), and FOXP3(+) cells within neoplastic epithelial areas using an Ariol image analysis system and tissue microarray. We used Cox proportional hazard models to compute the mortality hazard ratio, adjusting for clinical and molecular features including KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations, MSI, CIMP, and LINE-1 hypomethylation. The densities of CD8(+), CD45RO(+), and FOXP3(+) cells were significantly associated with patient survival in univariate analyses (P(trend) < 0.007). In the multivariate model, tumour-infiltrating CD45RO(+)-cell density, but not CD3(+), CD8(+) or FOXP3(+)-cell density, was significantly associated with survival (p = 0.0032). In multivariate linear regression analysis, MSI-high (p < 0.0001) and high-level tumour LINE-1 methylation (p = 0.0013) were independently associated with higher CD45RO(+)-cell density. The survival benefit associated with CD45RO(+) cells was independent of MSI and LINE-1 status. In conclusion, tumour-infiltrating CD45RO(+)-cell density is a prognostic biomarker associated with longer survival of colorectal cancer patients, independent of clinical, pathological, and molecular features.

J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2010-10-18,"The German rectal study determined that preoperative radiation therapy (RT) as a component of combined-modality therapy decreased local tumor recurrence, increased sphincter preservation, and decreased treatment toxicity compared with postoperative RT for rectal cancer. We evaluated the use of preoperative RT after the presentation of the landmark German rectal study results and examined the impact of tumor and sociodemographic factors on receiving preoperative RT. In total, 20,982 patients who underwent surgical resection for T3-T4 and/or node-positive rectal adenocarcinoma diagnosed from 2000 through 2006 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results tumor registries. We analyzed trends in preoperative RT use before and after publication of the findings from the German rectal study. We also performed multivariate logistic regression to identify factors associated with receiving preoperative RT. Among those treated with RT, the proportion of patients treated with preoperative RT increased from 33.3% in 2000 to 63.8% in 2006. After adjustment for age; gender; race/ethnicity; marital status; Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry; county-level education; T stage; N stage; tumor size; and tumor grade, there was a significant association between later year of diagnosis and an increase in preoperative RT use (adjusted odds ratio, 1.26/y increase; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-1.29). When we compared the years before and after publication of the German rectal study (2000-2003 vs. 2004-2006), patients were more likely to receive preoperative RT than postoperative RT in 2004-2006 (adjusted odds ratio, 2.35; 95% confidence interval, 2.13-2.59). On multivariate analysis, patients who were older, who were female, and who resided in counties with lower educational levels had significantly decreased odds of receiving preoperative RT.

All patients underwent a craniotomy and were at least 2 weeks postoperative. Radiation therapy was administered in 1.8-Gy fractions, with the clinical target volume for the primary course treated to a dose of 45 to 50.4 Gy, followed by a boost of 9 to 14.4 Gy, to a total dose of 59.4 Gy.

Molecular pathological epidemiology of colorectal neoplasia: an emerging transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary field.,Gut,Gut,2010-10-29,"Colorectal cancer is a complex disease resulting from somatic genetic and epigenetic alterations, including locus-specific CpG island methylation and global DNA or LINE-1 hypomethylation. Global molecular characteristics such as microsatellite instability (MSI), CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), global DNA hypomethylation, and chromosomal instability cause alterations of gene function on a genome-wide scale. Activation of oncogenes including KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA affects intracellular signalling pathways and has been associated with CIMP and MSI. Traditional epidemiology research has investigated various factors in relation to an overall risk of colon and/or rectal cancer. However, colorectal cancers comprise a heterogeneous group of diseases with different sets of genetic and epigenetic alterations. To better understand how a particular exposure influences the carcinogenic and pathologic process, somatic molecular changes and tumour biomarkers have been studied in relation to the exposure of interest. Moreover, an investigation of interactive effects of tumour molecular changes and the exposures of interest on tumour behaviour (prognosis or clinical outcome) can lead to a better understanding of tumour molecular changes, which may be prognostic or predictive tissue biomarkers. These new research efforts represent 'molecular pathologic epidemiology', which is a multidisciplinary field of investigations of the inter-relationship between exogenous and endogenous (eg, genetic) factors, tumoural molecular signatures and tumour progression. Furthermore, integrating genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with molecular pathological investigation is a promising area (GWAS-MPE approach).

Novel application of structural equation modeling to correlation structure analysis of CpG island methylation in colorectal cancer.,The American journal of pathology,Am. J. Pathol.,2010-10-29,"The CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP-high, CIMP1) is a distinct phenotype associated with microsatellite instability (MSI) and BRAF mutation in colon cancer. Recent evidence suggests the presence of KRAS mutation-associated CIMP subtype (CIMP-low, CIMP2). We used cluster analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and structural equation modeling (SEM), a novel strategy, to decipher the correlation structure of CpG island hypermethylation. Using a database of 861 colon and rectal cancers, DNA methylation at 16 CpG islands [CACNA1G, CDKN2A (p16/ink4a), CHFR, CRABP1, HIC1, IGF2, IGFBP3, MGMT, MINT-1, MINT-31, MLH1, NEUROG1, p14 (CDKN2A/arf), RUNX3, SOCS1, and WRN] was quantified by real-time PCR. Tumors were categorized into three groups: Group 1 with wild-type KRAS/BRAF (N = 440); Group 2 with mutant KRAS and wild-type BRAF (N = 308); and Group 3 with wild-type KRAS and mutant BRAF (N = 107). Tumors with mutant KRAS/BRAF (N = 6) were excluded. In unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis, all but six markers (CACNA1G, IGF2, RUNX3, MGMT, MINT-1, and SOCS1) were differentially clustered with CIMP-high and CIMP-low according to KRAS and BRAF status. In SEM, the correlation structures between CIMP, locus-specific CpG island methylation, and MSI differed according to KRAS and BRAF status, which was consistent with PCA results. In conclusion, KRAS and BRAF mutations appear to differentially influence correlation structure of CpG island methylation. Our novel data suggest two distinct perturbations, resulting in differential locus-specific propensity of CpG methylation.",Journal Article,3371.0,,The CpG island methylator phenotype CIMP-high CIMP1 is a distinct phenotype associated with microsatellite instability MSI and BRAF mutation in cancer Recent evidence suggests the presence of KRAS mutation-associated CIMP subtype CIMP-low CIMP2 We used cluster analysis principal component analysis PCA and structural equation modeling SEM a novel strategy to decipher the correlation structure of CpG island hypermethylation Using a database of 861 and cancers DNA methylation at 16 CpG islands CACNA1G CDKN2A p16/ink4a CHFR CRABP1 HIC1 IGF2 IGFBP3 MGMT MINT-1 MINT-31 MLH1 NEUROG1 p14 CDKN2A/arf RUNX3 SOCS1 and WRN was quantified by real-time PCR Tumors were categorized into three groups Group 1 with wild-type KRAS/BRAF N 440 Group 2 with mutant KRAS and wild-type BRAF N 308 and Group 3 with wild-type KRAS and mutant BRAF N 107 Tumors with mutant KRAS/BRAF N 6 were excluded In unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis all but six markers CACNA1G IGF2 RUNX3 MGMT MINT-1 and SOCS1 were differentially clustered with CIMP-high and CIMP-low according to KRAS and BRAF status In SEM the correlation structures between CIMP locus-specific CpG island methylation and MSI differed according to KRAS and BRAF status which was consistent with PCA results In conclusion KRAS and BRAF mutations appear to differentially influence correlation structure of CpG island methylation Our novel data suggest two distinct perturbations resulting in differential locus-specific propensity of CpG methylation,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[3, 2075, 3454, 5440, 1005, 2302, 64, 59492, 16, 8, 834, 1005, 41, 5, 2226, 1753, 1494, 2, 566, 258, 4, 12, 435, 241, 844, 3, 463, 1, 723, 258, 41, 2302, 875, 2302, 154, 59493, 21, 95, 3132, 65, 4312, 1249, 65, 1265, 2, 3281, 5747, 2057, 8719, 8, 229, 692, 6, 11805, 3, 816, 2772, 1, 2075, 3454, 2575, 75, 8, 609, 1, 13668, 2, 163, 261, 569, 28, 245, 2075, 6046, 10910, 3175, 1932, 6276, 13391, 12019, 12299, 5466, 8814, 2661, 29087, 14, 29087, 456, 3321, 11037, 10556, 3175, 5509, 5883, 10239, 2, 12652, 10, 2790, 20, 1589, 98, 604, 57, 11, 2320, 237, 169, 271, 87, 14, 5, 955, 267, 723, 566, 78, 9596, 87, 18, 5, 620, 723, 2, 955, 267, 566, 78, 7786, 2, 87, 27, 5, 955, 267, 723, 2, 620, 566, 78, 3650, 57, 5, 620, 723, 566, 78, 49, 11, 1800, 4, 6512, 4466, 3147, 65, 62, 84, 437, 525, 10910, 5466, 5883, 2661, 29087, 14, 2, 10239, 11, 2478, 6464, 5, 2302, 64, 2, 2302, 154, 768, 6, 723, 2, 566, 156, 4, 8719, 3, 816, 2414, 59, 2302, 2474, 112, 2075, 3454, 569, 2, 1494, 2512, 768, 6, 723, 2, 566, 156, 92, 10, 925, 5, 1265, 99, 4, 1221, 723, 2, 566, 138, 1322, 6, 2478, 1054, 816, 2772, 1, 2075, 3454, 569, 114, 229, 74, 309, 100, 834, 7013, 1113, 4, 1777, 2474, 112, 1925, 1, 2075, 569]",1499.0,21037082,534
Vaginal motion and bladder and rectal volumes during pelvic intensity-modulated radiation therapy after hysterectomy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2010-11-17,"To evaluate variations in bladder and rectal volume and the position of the vaginal vault during a 5-week course of pelvic intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) after hysterectomy. Twenty-four patients were instructed how to fill their bladders before simulation and treatment. These patients underwent computed tomography simulations with full and empty bladders and then underwent rescanning twice weekly during IMRT; patients were asked to have full bladder for treatment. Bladder and rectal volumes and the positions of vaginal fiducial markers were determined, and changes in volume and position were calculated. The mean full and empty bladder volumes at simulation were 480 cc (range, 122-1,052) and 155 cc (range, 49-371), respectively. Bladder volumes varied widely during IMRT: the median difference between the maximum and minimum volumes was 247 cc (range, 96-585). Variations in rectal volume during IMRT were less pronounced. For the 16 patients with vaginal fiducial markers in place throughout IMRT, the median maximum movement of the markers during IMRT was 0.59 cm in the right-left direction (range, 0-0.9), 1.46 cm in the anterior-posterior direction (range, 0.8-2.79), and 1.2 cm in the superior-inferior direction (range, 0.6-2.1). Large variations in rectal or bladder volume frequently correlated with significant displacement of the vaginal apex. Although treatment with a full bladder is usually preferred because of greater sparing of small bowel, our data demonstrate that even with detailed instruction, patients are unable to maintain consistent bladder filling. Variations in organ position during IMRT can result in marked changes in the position of the target volume and the volume of small bowel exposed to high doses of radiation.",Journal Article,3352.0,43.0,"To evaluate variations in and volume and the position of the vault during a 5-week course of pelvic intensity-modulated radiation therapy IMRT after hysterectomy Twenty-four patients were instructed how to fill their bladders before simulation and treatment These patients underwent computed tomography simulations with full and empty bladders and then underwent rescanning twice weekly during IMRT patients were asked to have full for treatment and volumes and the positions of fiducial markers were determined and changes in volume and position were calculated The mean full and empty volumes at simulation were 480 cc range 122-1,052 and 155 cc range 49-371 respectively volumes varied widely during IMRT the median difference between the maximum and minimum volumes was 247 cc range 96-585 Variations in volume during IMRT were less pronounced For the 16 patients with fiducial markers in place throughout IMRT the median maximum movement of the markers during IMRT was 0.59 cm in the right-left direction range 0-0.9 1.46 cm in the anterior-posterior direction range 0.8-2.79 and 1.2 cm in the superior-inferior direction range 0.6-2.1 Large variations in or volume frequently correlated with significant displacement of the apex Although treatment with a full is usually preferred because of greater sparing of small bowel our data demonstrate that even with detailed instruction patients are unable to maintain consistent filling Variations in organ position during IMRT can result in marked changes in the position of the target volume and the volume of small bowel exposed to high doses of radiation",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[6, 376, 2293, 4, 2, 433, 2, 3, 3559, 1, 3, 28115, 190, 8, 33, 647, 906, 1, 1110, 837, 1757, 121, 36, 964, 50, 2622, 737, 294, 7, 11, 17184, 832, 6, 11476, 136, 19442, 348, 4026, 2, 24, 46, 7, 208, 1220, 872, 7490, 5, 1647, 2, 9436, 19442, 2, 818, 208, 25083, 936, 709, 190, 964, 7, 11, 3732, 6, 47, 1647, 9, 24, 2, 2225, 2, 3, 7134, 1, 8416, 525, 11, 509, 2, 400, 4, 433, 2, 3559, 11, 981, 3, 313, 1647, 2, 9436, 2225, 28, 4026, 11, 9108, 1951, 184, 3285, 14, 9194, 2, 3735, 1951, 184, 739, 9196, 106, 2225, 2051, 1792, 190, 964, 3, 52, 523, 59, 3, 689, 2, 2499, 2225, 10, 7708, 1951, 184, 921, 15351, 2293, 4, 433, 190, 964, 11, 299, 3517, 9, 3, 245, 7, 5, 8416, 525, 4, 3536, 2432, 964, 3, 52, 689, 7950, 1, 3, 525, 190, 964, 10, 13, 728, 494, 4, 3, 1913, 1712, 4651, 184, 13, 13, 83, 14, 641, 494, 4, 3, 2882, 3028, 4651, 184, 13, 66, 18, 842, 2, 14, 18, 494, 4, 3, 1123, 1663, 4651, 184, 13, 49, 18, 14, 375, 2293, 4, 15, 433, 746, 438, 5, 93, 6850, 1, 3, 8670, 242, 24, 5, 8, 1647, 16, 2082, 2514, 408, 1, 378, 1851, 1, 302, 1659, 114, 74, 608, 17, 871, 5, 2455, 19661, 7, 32, 4253, 6, 3040, 925, 13930, 2293, 4, 1259, 3559, 190, 964, 122, 757, 4, 2003, 400, 4, 3, 3559, 1, 3, 283, 433, 2, 3, 433, 1, 302, 1659, 2234, 6, 64, 415, 1, 121]",1608.0,21093170,144
The Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets and colorectal cancer.,The American journal of clinical nutrition,Am. J. Clin. Nutr.,2010-12-01,"Although the Mediterranean diet has been studied for cancer mortality and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet shares similarities with the Mediterranean diet, few studies have specifically examined these 2 diets and incident colorectal cancer. The objective was to prospectively assess the association between the Alternate Mediterranean Diet (aMed) and the DASH-style diet scores and risk of colorectal cancer in middle-aged men and women. A total of 87,256 women and 45,490 men (age 30-55 y for women and 40-75 y for men at baseline) without a history of cancer were followed for ≤ 26 y. The aMed and DASH scores were calculated for each participant by using dietary information that was assessed ≤ 7 times during follow-up. Relative risks (RRs) for colorectal cancer were computed with adjustment for potential confounders. We documented 1432 cases of incident colorectal cancer among women and 1032 cases in men. Comparing top with bottom quintiles of the DASH score, the pooled RR for total colorectal cancer was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.91; P for trend = 0.0001). The corresponding RR for DASH score and colon cancer was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.95; P for trend = 0.002).

Daily online cone beam computed tomography to assess interfractional motion in patients with intact cervical cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2010-11-23,"To quantify interfraction motion in patients with intact cervical cancer and assess implications for clinical target volume (CTV) coverage and required planning margins. We analyzed 10 patients undergoing external beam radiotherapy using online cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) before each fraction. CTVs were contoured on the planning CT and on each CBCT. Each CBCT was rigidly registered to the planning CT with respect to bony anatomy. The CTV from each CBCT was projected onto the planning CT and compared to the CTV from the planning CT. Uniform three-dimensional expansions were applied to the planning CTV to assess required planning margins. For each fraction, the minimum margin required to encompass the CTV was calculated, and the volume of CTV (on the CBCT) encompassed by the PTV was determined as a function of margin size. A uniform CTV planning treatment volume margin of 15 mm would have failed to encompass the CTV in 32% of fractions. The mean volume of CTV missed, however, was small (4 cc). The mean planning margin (across patients and fractions) required to encompass the CTV was 15 mm. Variation in margin estimates was high, with interpatient variation being the predominant component. Increased rectal volume was associated with posterior (p < 0.0001) and superior (p = 0.0004) shifts in the CTV, whereas increased bladder volume was associated with superior shifts (p < 0.0001). Interfraction motion results in a high probability of missing the CTV using conventional planning margins, but the volume of CTV missed is small.

Active surveillance compared with initial treatment for men with low-risk prostate cancer: a decision analysis.,JAMA,JAMA,2010-12-01,"In the United States, 192,000 men were diagnosed as having prostate cancer in 2009, the majority with low-risk, clinically localized disease. Treatment of these cancers is associated with substantial morbidity. Active surveillance is an alternative to initial treatment, but long-term outcomes and effect on quality of life have not been well characterized. To examine the quality-of-life benefits and risks of active surveillance compared with initial treatment for men with low-risk, clinically localized prostate cancer. Decision analysis using a simulation model was performed: men were treated at diagnosis with brachytherapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), or radical prostatectomy or followed up by active surveillance (a strategy of close monitoring of newly diagnosed patients with serial prostate-specific antigen measurements, digital rectal examinations, and biopsies, with treatment at disease progression or patient choice). Probabilities and utilities were derived from previous studies and literature review. In the base case, the relative risk of prostate cancer-specific death for initial treatment vs active surveillance was assumed to be 0.83. Men incurred short- and long-term adverse effects of treatment. Hypothetical cohorts of 65-year-old men newly diagnosed as having clinically localized, low-risk prostate cancer (prostate-specific antigen level <10 ng/mL, stage ≤T2a disease, and Gleason score ≤6). Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE). Active surveillance was associated with the greatest QALE (11.07 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]), followed by brachytherapy (10.57 QALYs), IMRT (10.51 QALYs), and radical prostatectomy (10.23 QALYs). Active surveillance remained associated with the highest QALE even if the relative risk of prostate cancer-specific death for initial treatment vs active surveillance was as low as 0.6. However, the QALE gains and the optimal strategy were highly dependent on individual preferences for living under active surveillance and for having been treated. Under a wide range of assumptions, for a 65-year-old man, active surveillance is a reasonable approach to low-risk prostate cancer based on QALE compared with initial treatment. However, individual preferences play a central role in the decision whether to treat or to pursue active surveillance.",Comparative Study,3338.0,190.0,"In the United States 192,000 men were diagnosed as having cancer in 2009 the majority with low-risk clinically localized disease Treatment of these cancers is associated with substantial morbidity Active surveillance is an alternative to initial treatment but long-term outcomes and effect on quality of life have not been well characterized To examine the quality-of-life benefits and risks of active surveillance compared with initial treatment for men with low-risk clinically localized cancer Decision analysis using a simulation model was performed men were treated at diagnosis with brachytherapy intensity-modulated radiation therapy IMRT or radical prostatectomy or followed up by active surveillance a strategy of close monitoring of newly diagnosed patients with serial prostate-specific antigen measurements digital examinations and biopsies with treatment at disease progression or patient choice Probabilities and utilities were derived from previous studies and literature review In the base case the relative risk of cancer-specific death for initial treatment vs active surveillance was assumed to be 0.83 Men incurred short- and long-term adverse effects of treatment Hypothetical cohorts of 65-year-old men newly diagnosed as having clinically localized low-risk cancer prostate-specific antigen level 10 ng/mL stage ≤T2a disease and Gleason score ≤6 Quality-adjusted life expectancy QALE Active surveillance was associated with the greatest QALE 11.07 quality-adjusted life-years QALYs followed by brachytherapy 10.57 QALYs IMRT 10.51 QALYs and radical prostatectomy 10.23 QALYs Active surveillance remained associated with the highest QALE even if the relative risk of cancer-specific death for initial treatment vs active surveillance was as low as 0.6 However the QALE gains and the optimal strategy were highly dependent on individual preferences for living under active surveillance and for having been treated Under a wide range of assumptions for a 65-year-old man active surveillance is a reasonable approach to low-risk cancer based on QALE compared with initial treatment However individual preferences play a central role in the decision whether to treat or to pursue active surveillance",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[4, 3, 1088, 907, 5016, 984, 325, 11, 265, 22, 1041, 12, 4, 1238, 3, 686, 5, 154, 43, 505, 909, 34, 24, 1, 46, 163, 16, 41, 5, 1281, 787, 544, 617, 16, 35, 1091, 6, 388, 24, 84, 319, 337, 123, 2, 254, 23, 372, 1, 358, 47, 44, 85, 149, 765, 6, 1004, 3, 372, 1, 358, 1141, 2, 1098, 1, 544, 617, 72, 5, 388, 24, 9, 325, 5, 154, 43, 505, 909, 12, 948, 65, 75, 8, 4026, 202, 10, 173, 325, 11, 73, 28, 147, 5, 1536, 837, 1757, 121, 36, 964, 15, 711, 1202, 15, 370, 126, 20, 544, 617, 8, 692, 1, 2336, 1315, 1, 732, 265, 7, 5, 2108, 1364, 112, 448, 1685, 3271, 4209, 2, 1154, 5, 24, 28, 34, 91, 15, 69, 1866, 3518, 2, 7114, 11, 526, 29, 698, 94, 2, 789, 206, 4, 3, 1782, 473, 3, 580, 43, 1, 12, 112, 273, 9, 388, 24, 105, 544, 617, 10, 6719, 6, 40, 13, 852, 325, 11172, 978, 2, 319, 337, 290, 176, 1, 24, 7045, 736, 1, 556, 111, 1095, 325, 732, 265, 22, 1041, 505, 909, 154, 43, 12, 1364, 112, 448, 301, 79, 997, 542, 82, 46340, 34, 2, 1406, 368, 10020, 372, 586, 358, 3399, 18015, 544, 617, 10, 41, 5, 3, 2199, 18015, 175, 1615, 372, 586, 358, 60, 6764, 370, 20, 1536, 79, 696, 6764, 964, 79, 725, 6764, 2, 711, 1202, 79, 382, 6764, 544, 617, 958, 41, 5, 3, 1076, 18015, 871, 492, 3, 580, 43, 1, 12, 112, 273, 9, 388, 24, 105, 544, 617, 10, 22, 154, 22, 13, 49, 137, 3, 18015, 3849, 2, 3, 665, 692, 11, 561, 470, 23, 797, 2875, 9, 2798, 669, 544, 617, 2, 9, 1041, 85, 73, 669, 8, 1019, 184, 1, 8387, 9, 8, 556, 111, 1095, 3628, 544, 617, 16, 8, 3203, 353, 6, 154, 43, 12, 90, 23, 18015, 72, 5, 388, 24, 137, 797, 2875, 1343, 8, 854, 200, 4, 3, 948, 317, 6, 943, 15, 6, 7874, 544, 617]",2217.0,21119084,18
Impact of a temporary stoma on the quality of life of rectal cancer patients undergoing treatment.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2010-12-03,"Data from randomized controlled trials support use of a diverting stoma in rectal cancer patients with low anastomoses, but there is little data on how this impacts patient quality of life (QOL). This study prospectively evaluates QOL in stage I-III rectal cancer patients undergoing sphincter-preserving surgery (SPS) with a temporary diverting stoma. Patents were identified from a prospective single-institution study of stage I-III rectal cancer patients undergoing SPS. Patients completed the EORTC C30/CR38 QOL scale preoperatively, at stoma closure, and at 6 months. The Stoma Quality of Life (SQOL) was administered at stoma closure. Subscales of the EORTC hypothesized to be affected by a diverting stoma were identified a priori. Longitudinal trends were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. Frequencies for responses on specific SQOL items were tabulated, and correlations between SQOL subscales and EORTC Global QOL assessed with Pearson correlation coefficient. Global QOL was reportedly good (mean score 70.2) and did not change with a temporary stoma (P = .83). Physical (P = .33), role (P = .07), and social function (P = .48) were also stable. Decreased body image was observed (P = .03). Stoma-related difficulties identified by the SQOL included sexual activity (53%), leakage (39%), discomfort in clothing (34%), concerns regarding privacy to empty pouch (32%), and feeling unattractive (31%).

Prognostic value of quality of life and pain in patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2010-12-04,"Care of patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC) requires careful patient selection. While curative resection offers survival benefits, significant trade-offs exist for the patient. Knowledge of patient-reported outcomes will help inform treatment decisions. Quality of life (QOL) and pain were prospectively assessed in 105 patients treated for LRRC at a single institution, using the validated Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal (FACT-C) and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaires. In 54 patients enrolled and followed from diagnosis of LRRC, relationship between pretreatment pain, QOL, and overall survival (OS) were examined. Patients underwent curative surgical resection (C, 59%), noncurative surgery (NC, 12%) or nonsurgical treatment (NS, 28%). Median OS was 7.1, 1.4, and 1.9 years, respectively (C versus NC: p < 0.001; C versus NS: p = 0.006; NC versus NS: p = 0.261). Physical well-being QOL differed over time (p = 0.042), with greatest difference between C and NC surgery patients (p = 0.049). The remaining QOL domain scores and pain scores demonstrated no significant time or treatment effect. For the 54 patients assessed from diagnosis, median OS was independently predicted by treatment group (C, NC, NS: 4.3, 1.7, versus 2.4 years; p < 0.001) and pretreatment pain intensity (score ≤ 4 versus > 4: 3.8 versus 2.0 years; p = 0.001). Curative surgery offered prolonged survival, but significant pain exists among long-term survivors and should be a focus of survivorship care.

"MGMT promoter methylation, loss of expression and prognosis in 855 colorectal cancers.",Cancer causes & control : CCC,Cancer Causes Control,2010-12-08,"O⁶-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair enzyme. MGMT promoter hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing often occur as early events in carcinogenesis. However, prognostic significance of MGMT alterations in colorectal cancer remains uncertain. Utilizing a database of 855 colon and rectal cancers in two prospective cohort studies (the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study), we detected MGMT promoter hypermethylation in 325 tumors (38%) by MethyLight and loss of MGMT expression in 37% (247/672) of tumors by immunohistochemistry. We assessed the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) using eight methylation markers [CACNA1G, CDKN2A (p16), CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, RUNX3, and SOCS1], and LINE-1 (L1) hypomethylation, TP53 (p53), and microsatellite instability (MSI). MGMT hypermethylation was not associated with colorectal cancer-specific mortality in univariate or multivariate Cox regression analysis [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 1.03; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.79-1.36] that adjusted for clinical and tumor features, including CIMP, MSI, and BRAF mutation. Similarly, MGMT loss was not associated with patient survival. MGMT loss was associated with G>A mutations in KRAS (p = 0.019) and PIK3CA (p = 0.0031).

Phase I trial of pelvic nodal dose escalation with hypofractionated IMRT for high-risk prostate cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2010-12-14,"Toxicity concerns have limited pelvic nodal prescriptions to doses that may be suboptimal for controlling microscopic disease. In a prospective trial, we tested whether image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) can safely deliver escalated nodal doses while treating the prostate with hypofractionated radiotherapy in 5½ weeks. Pelvic nodal and prostatic image-guided IMRT was delivered to 53 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) high-risk patients to a nodal dose of 56 Gy in 2-Gy fractions with concomitant treatment of the prostate to 70 Gy in 28 fractions of 2.5 Gy, and 50 of 53 patients received androgen deprivation for a median duration of 12 months. The median follow-up time was 25.4 months (range, 4.2-57.2). No early Grade 3 Radiation Therapy Oncology Group or Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.3.0 genitourinary (GU) or gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities were seen. The cumulative actuarial incidence of Grade 2 early GU toxicity (primarily alpha blocker initiation) was 38%. The rate was 32% for Grade 2 early GI toxicity. None of the dose-volume descriptors correlated with GU toxicity, and only the volume of bowel receiving ≥30 Gy correlated with early GI toxicity (p = 0.029). Maximum late Grades 1, 2, and 3 GU toxicities were seen in 30%, 25%, and 2% of patients, respectively. Maximum late Grades 1 and 2 GI toxicities were seen in 30% and 8% (rectal bleeding requiring cautery) of patients, respectively. The estimated 3-year biochemical control (nadir + 2) was 81.2 ± 6.6%.

Significance of acellular mucin pools in rectal carcinoma after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2011-01-01,"The presence of mucin pools lacking neoplastic epithelium (""acellular"" mucin) in resection specimens of rectal carcinoma after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is a well-recognized phenomenon. The current recommendation by the College of American Pathologists is to regard acellular mucin as a type of treatment response and not as residual tumor. However, data-based evidence for or against such an approach is incomplete. In this study, we systematically analyzed the pattern and significance of mucin pools in 108 consecutive, prospectively collected resection specimens from patients who had uT3-4 and/or uN1 rectal cancer and were treated with preoperative long-course CRT. The 108 patients, 39 female and 69 male, had a median age of 58.5 years. With every tumor entirely examined in whole-mount sections, mucin pools were identified in 33 cases (33 of 108, 31%); in 16 (15%) they were all acellular. The mucin pools were focal (10% to 50% of the entire lesion) in 25 cases and extensive (>50%) in 8 cases. Mucin pools were also noted in the lymph nodes in 6 cases (6%); 3 of these were entirely acellular. Five cases had mucin pools in both the primary site and the lymph nodes. When acellular mucin was considered as ""no residual tumor,"" the complete pathologic response rate for the entire cohort was 22% (24 of 108). The pathologic stage of the residual tumor (ypT) was 0 or 1 for 27 cases (25%) and 2 to 4 for 81 cases. The pathologic stage of nodal disease (ypN) was 0 for 83 (77%) and 1 or 2 for 25 cases. When acellular mucin was considered as ""residual tumor,"" the complete pathologic response rate dropped to 17%; ypT was upstaged in 10 tumors and ypN was upstaged in 2 tumors. With a median follow-up of 31 months, the 3-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 73% for the entire group. Advanced pathologic response and low pathologic stage of the residual tumor (determined based on the depth of only viable tumor cells) correlated significantly with better RFS. However, the correlation between pathologic response and RFS became insignificant when acellular mucin pools were considered as residual tumor. Neither the presence of mucin pools nor their extent or cellularity had an impact on RFS. Furthermore, none of the 12 patients whose ypT or ypN was upstaged by acellular mucin had recurrent disease (3-y RFS of 100%). Thus, our results suggest that mucin pools in rectal carcinoma after neoadjuvant CRT do not have a significant impact on patient outcome, supporting the College of American Pathologists recommendation that only viable tumor cells, not acellular mucin, are to be interpreted as residual disease in the tumor pathologic staging.",Journal Article,3307.0,67.0,The presence of mucin pools lacking

Thymidylate synthase genotype-directed neoadjuvant chemoradiation for patients with rectal adenocarcinoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2011-01-04,"Downstaging (DS) of rectal cancers is achieved in approximately 45% of patients with neoadjuvant fluorouracil (FU) -based chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Polymorphisms in the thymidylate synthase gene (TYMS) had previously defined two risk groups associated with disparate tumor DS rates (60% v 22%). We conducted a prospective single-institution phase II study using TYMS genotyping to direct neoadjuvant CRT for patients with rectal cancer. Patients with T3/T4, N0-2, M0-1 rectal adenocarcinoma were evaluated for germline TYMS genotyping. Patients with TYMS *2/*2, *2/*3, or *2/*4 (good risk) were treated with standard chemoradiotherapy using infusional FU at 225 mg/m²/d. Patients with TYMS *3/*3 or *3/*4 (poor risk) were treated with FU/RT plus weekly intravenous irinotecan at 50 mg/m². The primary end point was pathologic DS. Secondary end points included complete tumor response (ypT0), toxicity, recurrence rates, and overall survival. Overall, 135 patients were enrolled, of whom 27.4% (37 of 135) were considered poor risk. The prespecified statistical goals were achieved, with DS and ypT0 rates reaching 64.4% and 20% for good-risk and 64.5% and 42% for poor-risk patients, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first study to prospectively use TYMS genotyping to direct neoadjuvant CRT in patients with rectal cancer. High rates of DS and ypT0 were achieved among both risk groups when personalized treatment was based on TYMS genotype. These results are encouraging, and further evaluation of this genotype-based strategy using a randomized study design for locally advanced rectal cancer is warranted.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",3304.0,38.0,Downstaging DS of cancers is achieved in approximately 45 of patients with neoadjuvant fluorouracil FU -based chemoradiotherapy CRT Polymorphisms in the thymidylate synthase gene TYMS had previously defined two risk groups associated with disparate tumor DS rates 60 v 22 We conducted a prospective single-institution phase II study using TYMS genotyping to direct neoadjuvant CRT for patients with cancer Patients with T3/T4 N0-2 M0-1 adenocarcinoma were evaluated for germline TYMS genotyping Patients with TYMS *2/*2 *2/*3 or *2/*4 good risk were treated with standard chemoradiotherapy using infusional FU at 225 mg/m²/d Patients with TYMS *3/*3 or *3/*4 poor risk were treated with FU/RT plus weekly intravenous irinotecan at 50 mg/m² The primary end point was pathologic DS Secondary end points included complete tumor response ypT0 toxicity recurrence rates and overall survival Overall 135 patients were enrolled of whom 27.4 37 of 135 were considered poor risk The prespecified statistical goals were achieved with DS and ypT0 rates reaching 64.4 and 20 for good-risk and 64.5 and 42 for poor-risk patients respectively To our knowledge this is the first study to prospectively use TYMS genotyping to direct neoadjuvant CRT in patients with cancer High rates of DS and ypT0 were achieved among both risk groups when personalized treatment was based on TYMS genotype These results are encouraging and further evaluation of this genotype-based strategy using a randomized study design for locally advanced cancer is warranted,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[5336, 3602, 1, 163, 16, 513, 4, 705, 512, 1, 7, 5, 536, 1404, 1296, 90, 1464, 1089, 1203, 4, 3, 6205, 3522, 145, 8799, 42, 373, 395, 100, 43, 271, 41, 5, 7985, 30, 3602, 151, 335, 603, 350, 21, 426, 8, 482, 226, 731, 124, 215, 45, 75, 8799, 2686, 6, 1196, 536, 1089, 9, 7, 5, 12, 7, 5, 2065, 2463, 3394, 18, 4591, 14, 449, 11, 194, 9, 1009, 8799, 2686, 7, 5, 8799, 18, 18, 18, 27, 15, 18, 39, 1178, 43, 11, 73, 5, 260, 1464, 75, 4825, 1296, 28, 4011, 81, 4709, 427, 7, 5, 8799, 27, 27, 15, 27, 39, 334, 43, 11, 73, 5, 1296, 240, 349, 709, 1262, 1071, 28, 212, 81, 4709, 3, 86, 396, 741, 10, 510, 3602, 568, 396, 862, 159, 236, 30, 51, 9607, 155, 146, 151, 2, 63, 25, 63, 3978, 7, 11, 346, 1, 953, 428, 39, 567, 1, 3978, 11, 515, 334, 43, 3, 4075, 1050, 2802, 11, 513, 5, 3602, 2, 9607, 151, 6168, 660, 39, 2, 179, 9, 1178, 43, 2, 660, 33, 2, 595, 9, 334, 43, 7, 106, 6, 114, 922, 26, 16, 3, 157, 45, 6, 1143, 119, 8799, 2686, 6, 1196, 536, 1089, 4, 7, 5, 12, 64, 151, 1, 3602, 2, 9607, 11, 513, 107, 110, 43, 271, 198, 2175, 24, 10, 90, 23, 8799, 1183, 46, 99, 32, 2269, 2, 195, 451, 1, 26, 1183, 90, 692, 75, 8, 384, 45, 771, 9, 795, 131, 12, 16, 1197]",1532.0,21205745,325
Trends in colorectal cancer incidence by anatomic site and disease stage in the United States from 1976 to 2005.,American journal of clinical oncology,Am. J. Clin. Oncol.,2011-12-01,"The objectives of the current study were to examine the trends in incidence rates of subsite-specific colorectal cancer at all stages in a large US population and to explore the impact of age and sex on colorectal cancer incidence. Data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 9 registries. Colorectal cancer incidence was divided into 3 anatomic subsite groupings: proximal colon, distal colon, and rectum. Incidence rates and relative risk were calculated using the SEER*Stat software provided by the National Cancer Institute. From 1976 to 2005, age-adjusted incidence of proximal colon, distal colon, and rectal cancers per 100,000 population have steadily decreased from 22.5, 18.8, and 19.2 to 21.1, 11.7, and 13.6, respectively, contributing to the overall decline in the incidence of colorectal cancer from 60.5 to 46.4. Distal colon cancer had the greatest incidence decline (-37.79%), whereas the most minimal change in the incidence rates occurred for proximal colon cancer (-6.37%) because of increased incidence rates of ascending colon (24.8%) and hepatic flexure (21.3%) over 30 years. The steadily increased proportion of proximal colorectal cancer subsites was observed in both men and women starting at age 50 although women experienced a greater increase than did men. Overall incidence rate of colorectal cancer decreased over the past 3 decades. The percent of ascending colon and hepatic flexure cancers diagnosed at early stages (localized and regional) increased.

A significant decrease in rectal volume and diameter during prostate IMRT.,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,Radiother Oncol,2011-01-25,"To record changes in rectal volume (RV) and diameter (RD) of patients with prostate adenocarcinoma prior to and at an interim period during radiotherapy, which could potentially affect treatment toxicity and tumor control. Three hundred and fifteen patients treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) underwent planning CT scans before radiation and after 45 Gy. For each scan, RV and RD were recorded and compared using a two-tailed paired t-test. Robust linear regression analysis assessed correlation between initial RV and percent RV change. The mean change in RV was -8.62 cm(3) and in RD was -0.19 cm(3), (p<0.05). A decrease ≥10% in RV and RD was seen in 159 patients (50.5%) and 117 patients (37.1%), respectively. Patients with ≥10% volume change had larger initial RVs than those with <10% decrease, (78.1 vs. 50.8 cm(3), p<0.0001). A significant decrease in RV and RD occurs during prostate IMRT delivery. More than half of patients had decreased RV and over a third had decreased RD. This observation is pertinent to prostate localization, planning margins, and implies that dose-volume histogram (DVH) analysis of rectal irradiation based on pre-treatment CT scanning may inaccurately estimate the risk of rectal toxicity when the initial RV is larger than 70 cm(3).",Journal Article,3283.0,18.0,To record changes in volume RV and diameter RD of patients with adenocarcinoma prior to and at an interim period during radiotherapy which could potentially affect treatment toxicity and tumor control Three hundred and fifteen patients treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy IMRT underwent planning CT scans before radiation and after 45 Gy For each scan RV and RD were recorded and compared using a two-tailed paired t-test Robust linear regression analysis assessed correlation between initial RV and percent RV change The mean change in RV was -8.62 cm 3 and in RD was -0.19 cm 3 p 0.05 A decrease ≥10 in RV and RD was seen in 159 patients 50.5 and 117 patients 37.1 respectively Patients with ≥10 volume change had larger initial RVs than those with 10 decrease 78.1 vs. 50.8 cm 3 p 0.0001 A significant decrease in RV and RD occurs during IMRT delivery More than half of patients had decreased RV and over a third had decreased RD This observation is pertinent to localization planning margins and implies that dose-volume histogram DVH analysis of irradiation based on pre-treatment CT scanning may inaccurately estimate the risk of toxicity when the initial RV is larger than 70 cm 3,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[6, 3237, 400, 4, 433, 9345, 2, 2549, 3089, 1, 7, 5, 449, 324, 6, 2, 28, 35, 2914, 727, 190, 310, 92, 359, 751, 1158, 24, 155, 2, 30, 182, 169, 1128, 2, 3057, 7, 73, 5, 837, 1757, 310, 964, 208, 1349, 425, 1441, 348, 121, 2, 50, 512, 381, 9, 296, 1657, 9345, 2, 3089, 11, 1872, 2, 72, 75, 8, 100, 12119, 2355, 102, 412, 1922, 1646, 320, 65, 275, 816, 59, 388, 9345, 2, 714, 9345, 707, 3, 313, 707, 4, 9345, 10, 66, 744, 494, 27, 2, 4, 3089, 10, 13, 326, 494, 27, 19, 13, 474, 8, 775, 4556, 4, 9345, 2, 3089, 10, 527, 4, 5917, 7, 212, 33, 2, 3843, 7, 567, 14, 106, 7, 5, 4556, 433, 707, 42, 1077, 388, 26525, 76, 135, 5, 79, 775, 833, 14, 105, 212, 66, 494, 27, 19, 13, 488, 8, 93, 775, 4, 9345, 2, 3089, 1780, 190, 964, 989, 80, 76, 1303, 1, 7, 42, 340, 9345, 2, 252, 8, 1282, 42, 340, 3089, 26, 1664, 16, 5799, 6, 2145, 1349, 1012, 2, 10441, 17, 61, 433, 8261, 8255, 65, 1, 1104, 90, 23, 671, 24, 425, 3702, 68, 24518, 1191, 3, 43, 1, 155, 198, 3, 388, 9345, 16, 1077, 76, 431, 494, 27]",1197.0,21269715,138
Immunohistochemical staining for DNA mismatch repair proteins in intestinal tract carcinoma: how reliable are biopsy samples?,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2011-03-01,"In recent years, immunohistochemistry has emerged as an efficient tool in the detection of DNA mismatch repair protein abnormality in colorectal cancers. Currently, the immunohistochemical test is mainly applied to cancer resection specimens. Detection of mismatch repair abnormality in biopsies carries obvious clinical importance, as it would allow informed decision about the extent of surgery (segmental resection vs total colectomy, prophylactic hysterectomy or not). Moreover, in the case of treated rectal carcinoma with no residual tumor, it provides a means to evaluate the mismatch repair proteins. However, whether biopsy samples can be reliably used for mismatch repair protein detection remains to be determined. Paired biopsy and resection specimens of adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract, enriched for patients at increased risk for Lynch syndrome, were analyzed for immunohistochemical staining patterns for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. Abnormal staining was defined as total loss of protein in the tumor with appropriate control. Cases with focal and weak staining, defined as staining of no more than moderate intensity present in <10% of the tumor cells, were recorded. Correlation analysis with germline mutation data was in a subset of cases. Among 70 gastrointestinal tract cancers (3 from the small bowel, 36 from the right colon, 15 from the left colon, and 16 from the anorectum), both the biopsy and resection specimens detected the same 29 cancers as having loss of staining for at least 1 protein, 14 affecting MLH1/PMS2 and 15 affecting MSH2/MSH6. Focal and weak staining was most commonly seen for MLH1 stain in biopsies (4 of 70, 6%), followed by MSH6 stain in biopsies (3 of 70, 4%). Concordant staining patterns between biopsies and resections were reached in all 70 cases for MSH2 and PMS2, whereas discordant patterns were identified in 3 cases (3 of 70, 4%) for MLH1 and in 2 cases (2 of 70, 3%) for MSH6. None of the discordant patterns affected the final interpretation of whether the immunohistochemistry test was normal or abnormal in either the biopsy or the resection. In 13 of the 13 cases that were known to have a pathogenic germline mutation (5 in MLH1 and 8 in MSH2), the stains were abnormal for the corresponding protein and/or its partner protein in both the biopsy and the resection specimens. This study provides data indicating that biopsy samples are as reliable as resections in the immunohistochemical detection of mismatch repair protein abnormality in intestinal cancers. Our study also shows that various staining variations can occur in both biopsies and resections. Awareness and further understanding of such variations will enhance the use of immunohistochemistry, a commonplace tool that is being increasingly used in the screening workup for Lynch

"STAT3 expression, molecular features, inflammation patterns, and prognosis in a database of 724 colorectal cancers.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2011-02-10,"STAT3 is a transcription factor that is constitutively activated in some cancers. It seems to play crucial roles in cell proliferation and survival, angiogenesis, tumor-promoting inflammation, and suppression of antitumor host immune response in the tumor microenvironment. Although the STAT3 signaling pathway is a potential drug target, clinical, pathologic, molecular, or prognostic features of STAT3-activated colorectal cancer remain uncertain. Utilizing a database of 724 colon and rectal cancer cases, we evaluated phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) expression by immunohistochemistry. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to compute mortality HR, adjusting for clinical, pathologic, and molecular features, including microsatellite instability (MSI), the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), LINE-1 methylation, 18q LOH, TP53 (p53), CTNNB1 (β-catenin), JC virus T-antigen, and KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations. Among the 724 tumors, 131 (18%) showed high-level p-STAT3 expression (p-STAT3-high), 244 (34%) showed low-level expression (p-STAT3-low), and the remaining 349 (48%) were negative for p-STAT3. p-STAT3 overexpression was associated with significantly higher colorectal cancer-specific mortality [log-rank P = 0.0020; univariate HR (p-STAT3-high vs. p-STAT3-negative): 1.85, 95% CI: 1.30-2.63, P(trend) = 0.0005; multivariate HR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.11-2.34, P(trend) = 0.015]. p-STAT3 expression was positively associated with peritumoral lymphocytic reaction (multivariate OR: 3.23; 95% CI: 1.89-5.53, P < 0.0001). p-STAT3 expression was not associated with MSI, CIMP, or LINE-1 hypomethylation.

Number of lymph nodes examined and prognosis among pathologically lymph node-negative patients after preoperative chemoradiation therapy for rectal adenocarcinoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2011-02-15,"Preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer can decrease the number of evaluable lymph nodes. Hence, the prognostic role of lymph node evaluation in patients with rectal cancer who receive preoperative chemoradiation is unclear. The authors of this report evaluated the prognostic impact of the number of lymph nodes examined in patients with rectal cancer who had negative lymph nodes based on the pathologic extent of disease (ypN0) after they received preoperative chemoradiation. Between 1990 and 2004, 372 patients with nonmetastatic rectal adenocarcinoma received preoperative chemoradiation followed by mesorectal excision and had ypN0 disease. The median radiation dose was 45 gray, and 68% of patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients had a median of 7 lymph nodes examined after preoperative chemoradiation. Compared with patients who had ≤7 lymph nodes examined, patients who had >7 lymph nodes had higher 5-year rates of freedom from relapse (86% vs 72%; log-rank P = .005) and cancer-specific survival (95% vs 86%; log-rank P = .0004), but no significant difference was observed in the overall survival rate (87% vs 81%; log-rank P = .07). Multivariate Cox proportional models demonstrated that patients who had >7 lymph nodes examined had a significantly lower risk of relapse (hazard ratio [HR], 0.39; P = .003) and death from rectal cancer (HR, 0.45; P = .04) but a similar risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.46-1.20; P = .23) compared with patients who had ≤7 lymph nodes examined. The number of lymph nodes examined was associated independently with disease relapse and cancer-specific survival in patients with rectal cancer who had ypN0 disease after receiving preoperative chemoradiation. Hence, the authors concluded that the number of negative lymph nodes examined may be a prognostic factor in patients with rectal cancer who receive preoperative chemoradiation.",Journal Article,3262.0,44.0,Preoperative chemoradiation for cancer can decrease the number of evaluable lymph nodes Hence the prognostic role of lymph node evaluation in patients with cancer who receive preoperative chemoradiation is unclear The authors of this report evaluated the prognostic impact of the number of lymph nodes examined in patients with cancer who had negative lymph nodes based on the pathologic extent of disease ypN0 after they received preoperative chemoradiation Between 1990 and 2004 372 patients with nonmetastatic adenocarcinoma received preoperative chemoradiation followed by mesorectal excision and had ypN0 disease The median radiation dose was 45 gray and 68 of patients received adjuvant chemotherapy Patients had a median of 7 lymph nodes examined after preoperative chemoradiation Compared with patients who had ≤7 lymph nodes examined patients who had 7 lymph nodes had higher 5-year rates of freedom from relapse 86 vs 72 log-rank P .005 and cancer-specific survival 95 vs 86 log-rank P .0004 but no significant difference was observed in the overall survival rate 87 vs 81 log-rank P .07 Multivariate Cox proportional models demonstrated that patients who had 7 lymph nodes examined had a significantly lower risk of relapse hazard ratio HR 0.39 P .003 and death from cancer HR 0.45 P .04 but a similar risk of all-cause mortality HR 0.75 95 CI 0.46-1.20 P .23 compared with patients who had ≤7 lymph nodes examined The number of lymph nodes examined was associated independently with disease relapse and cancer-specific survival in patients with cancer who had ypN0 disease after receiving preoperative chemoradiation Hence the authors concluded that the number of negative lymph nodes examined may be a prognostic factor in patients with cancer who receive preoperative chemoradiation,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[498, 975, 9, 12, 122, 775, 3, 207, 1, 859, 263, 502, 3665, 3, 177, 200, 1, 263, 289, 451, 4, 7, 5, 12, 54, 560, 498, 975, 16, 1200, 3, 738, 1, 26, 414, 194, 3, 177, 345, 1, 3, 207, 1, 263, 502, 409, 4, 7, 5, 12, 54, 42, 199, 263, 502, 90, 23, 3, 510, 1039, 1, 34, 10484, 50, 491, 103, 498, 975, 59, 2289, 2, 1131, 10659, 7, 5, 2683, 449, 103, 498, 975, 370, 20, 5823, 1366, 2, 42, 10484, 34, 3, 52, 121, 61, 10, 512, 4163, 2, 806, 1, 7, 103, 249, 56, 7, 42, 8, 52, 1, 67, 263, 502, 409, 50, 498, 975, 72, 5, 7, 54, 42, 17452, 263, 502, 409, 7, 54, 42, 67, 263, 502, 42, 142, 33, 111, 151, 1, 3060, 29, 429, 868, 105, 720, 1066, 1026, 19, 1614, 2, 12, 112, 25, 48, 105, 868, 1066, 1026, 19, 5295, 84, 77, 93, 523, 10, 164, 4, 3, 63, 25, 116, 912, 105, 865, 1066, 1026, 19, 1615, 331, 418, 831, 274, 264, 17, 7, 54, 42, 67, 263, 502, 409, 42, 8, 97, 280, 43, 1, 429, 360, 197, 168, 13, 587, 19, 1421, 2, 273, 29, 12, 168, 13, 512, 19, 755, 84, 8, 288, 43, 1, 62, 708, 282, 168, 13, 481, 48, 58, 13, 641, 14, 179, 19, 382, 72, 5, 7, 54, 42, 17452, 263, 502, 409, 3, 207, 1, 263, 502, 409, 10, 41, 1042, 5, 34, 429, 2, 12, 112, 25, 4, 7, 5, 12, 54, 42, 10484, 34, 50, 357, 498, 975, 3665, 3, 738, 4724, 17, 3, 207, 1, 199, 263, 502, 409, 68, 40, 8, 177, 161, 4, 7, 5, 12, 54, 560, 498, 975]",1796.0,21328329,408
Tolerability of combined modality therapy for rectal cancer in elderly patients aged 75 years and older.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2011-03-04,"To determine the rate of treatment deviations during combined modality therapy for rectal cancer in elderly patients aged 75 years and older. We reviewed the records of consecutively treated patients with rectal cancer aged 75 years and older treated with combined modality therapy at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham & Women's Hospital from 2002 to 2007. The primary endpoint was the rate of treatment deviation, defined as a treatment break, dose reduction, early discontinuation of therapy, or hospitalization during combined modality therapy. Patient comorbidity was rated using the validated Adult Comorbidity Evaluation 27 Test (ACE-27) comorbidity index. Fisher's exact test and the Mantel-Haenszel trend test were used to identify predictors of treatment tolerability. Thirty-six eligible patients had a median age of 79.0 years (range, 75-87 years); 53% (19/36) had no or mild comorbidity and 47% (17/36) had moderate or severe comorbidity. In all, 58% of patients (21/36) were treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and 33% (12/36) with postoperative CRT. Although 92% patients (33/36) completed the planned radiotherapy (RT) dose, 25% (9/36) required an RT-treatment break, 11% (4/36) were hospitalized, and 33% (12/36) had a dose reduction, break, or discontinuation of concurrent chemotherapy. In all, 39% of patients (14/36) completed≥4 months of adjuvant chemotherapy, and 17% (6/36) completed therapy without a treatment deviation. More patients with no to mild comorbidity completed treatment than did patients with moderate to severe comorbidity (21% vs. 12%, p=0.66).

"Phosphorylated AKT expression is associated with PIK3CA mutation, low stage, and favorable outcome in 717 colorectal cancers.",Cancer,Cancer,2010-11-08,"AKT (AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3) was a downstream effector of phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and played crucial roles in protein synthesis, cellular metabolism, survival, and proliferation. The PI3K/AKT pathway was commonly activated in human cancers and was recognized as a potential target for anticancer therapy. Nonetheless, clinical, molecular, or prognostic features of AKT-activated colon cancer remained uncertain. Using a database of 717 colon and rectal cancers in the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, Ser473 phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) expression was detected in 448 (62%) tumors by immunohistochemistry. Cox proportional hazards model was used to compute mortality hazards ratio (HR), adjusting for clinical and tumoral features, including PIK3CA, KRAS, BRAF, microsatellite instability (MSI), CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), LINE-1 methylation, TP53 (p53), and FASN (fatty acid synthase). Tumor p-AKT expression was associated with PIK3CA mutation (odds ratio [OR], 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-2.80; P = .015). p-AKT expression was significantly associated with longer colorectal cancer-specific survival in Kaplan-Meier analysis (log-rank P = .0005), univariate Cox regression (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.47-0.82; P = .0006) and multivariate analysis (adjusted HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.56-0.99; P = .048) adjusting for clinical and molecular variables including PIK3CA, MSI, CIMP and LINE-1 hypomethylation. p-AKT expression was inversely associated with high stage (III-IV) (adjusted OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45-0.88, P = .0071). p-AKT expression in colorectal cancer is associated with low stage and good prognosis. p-AKT may serve as a tissue biomarker to identify patients with superior prognosis and a possible therapeutic target (analogous to estrogen receptor ESR1 in breast cancer).",Journal Article,3361.0,71.0,AKT AKT1 AKT2 and AKT3 was a downstream effector of phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase PI3K and played crucial roles in protein synthesis cellular metabolism survival and proliferation The PI3K/AKT pathway was commonly activated in human cancers and was recognized as a potential target for anticancer therapy Nonetheless clinical molecular or prognostic features of AKT-activated cancer remained uncertain Using a database of 717 and cancers in the Nurses Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study Ser473 phosphorylated AKT p-AKT expression was detected in 448 62 tumors by immunohistochemistry Cox proportional hazards model was used to compute mortality hazards ratio HR adjusting for clinical and tumoral features including PIK3CA KRAS BRAF microsatellite instability MSI CpG island methylator phenotype CIMP LINE-1 methylation TP53 p53 and FASN fatty acid synthase Tumor p-AKT expression was associated with PIK3CA mutation odds ratio OR 1.77 95 confidence interval CI 1.12-2.80 P .015 p-AKT expression was significantly associated with longer cancer-specific survival in Kaplan-Meier analysis log-rank P .0005 univariate Cox regression HR 0.62 95 CI 0.47-0.82 P .0006 and multivariate analysis adjusted HR 0.75 95 CI 0.56-0.99 P .048 adjusting for clinical and molecular variables including PIK3CA MSI CIMP and LINE-1 hypomethylation p-AKT expression was inversely associated with high stage III-IV adjusted OR 0.63 95 CI 0.45-0.88 P .0071 p-AKT expression in cancer is associated with low stage and good prognosis p-AKT may serve as a tissue biomarker to identify patients with superior prognosis and a possible therapeutic target analogous to estrogen receptor ESR1 in cancer,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[649, 4958, 10911, 2, 12429, 10, 8, 1489, 2070, 1, 26184, 27, 216, 974, 2, 7680, 2653, 1790, 4, 178, 2525, 763, 1600, 25, 2, 457, 3, 974, 649, 308, 10, 841, 735, 4, 171, 163, 2, 10, 1904, 22, 8, 174, 283, 9, 1475, 36, 4648, 38, 219, 15, 177, 404, 1, 649, 735, 12, 958, 2717, 75, 8, 609, 1, 14430, 2, 163, 4, 3, 2707, 341, 45, 2, 3, 341, 3409, 166, 126, 45, 11842, 2365, 649, 19, 649, 55, 10, 530, 4, 15302, 744, 57, 20, 888, 418, 831, 1017, 202, 10, 95, 6, 9577, 282, 1017, 197, 168, 1358, 9, 38, 2, 4204, 404, 141, 1506, 723, 566, 2226, 1753, 1494, 2075, 3454, 5440, 1005, 2302, 328, 14, 569, 1206, 624, 2, 5728, 4038, 971, 3522, 30, 19, 649, 55, 10, 41, 5, 1506, 258, 610, 197, 15, 14, 849, 48, 307, 268, 58, 14, 133, 18, 493, 19, 3433, 19, 649, 55, 10, 97, 41, 5, 589, 12, 112, 25, 4, 876, 882, 65, 1066, 1026, 19, 4252, 880, 418, 320, 168, 13, 744, 48, 58, 13, 662, 13, 878, 19, 6013, 2, 331, 65, 586, 168, 13, 481, 48, 58, 13, 664, 13, 1058, 19, 4969, 1358, 9, 38, 2, 219, 682, 141, 1506, 1494, 2302, 2, 328, 14, 4441, 19, 649, 55, 10, 2659, 41, 5, 64, 82, 316, 478, 586, 15, 13, 676, 48, 58, 13, 512, 13, 889, 19, 24409, 19, 649, 55, 4, 12, 16, 41, 5, 154, 82, 2, 1178, 356, 19, 649, 68, 1833, 22, 8, 246, 901, 6, 255, 7, 5, 1123, 356, 2, 8, 899, 189, 283, 8579, 6, 808, 153, 4518, 4, 12]",1695.0,21425139,16
"Young-onset rectal cancer: presentation, pattern of care and long-term oncologic outcomes compared to a matched older-onset cohort.",Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2011-03-30,"Recent population-based studies have highlighted a disproportionate increase in the incidence of rectal cancer among adults younger than aged 50 years. To determine whether different intervention and surveillance strategies might be needed for younger patients, the patterns of care and oncologic outcomes among adults younger than aged 50 years with rectal cancer were investigated. A cohort of 333 young (<50 years) patients with sporadic rectal cancer was compared to a contemporaneous cohort of 675 older (>65 years) patients for differences in disease pattern, treatments received, and long-term disease-free survival (DFS). Patient and tumor characteristics did not differ between groups except for an increased presence of signet-ring and mucinous histology in young patients. Younger patients presented with more advanced-stage disease (stages III and IV: 59.4% vs. 46.4%; p = 0.016). More young patients received sphincter-preservation procedures (63.4 vs. 55.4%; p = 0.016), radiation (61.6 vs. 42.1%; p < 0.001), and chemotherapy (67.3 vs. 47.6%; p < 0.001). Fewer young patients were free from recurrent disease at the last follow-up (72.1 vs. 82.5%; p < 0.001). The stage-specific 5-year DFS did not differ between the young and older cohorts. Only stage and the need for chemotherapy independently predicted poor DFS. Young patients present at a later stage and a greater proportion develop distant disease recurrence over time. However, their stage-specific oncologic outcomes appear similar to those in older-onset patients. To have the greatest impact on long-term oncologic outcomes in patients with young-onset rectal cancer, future interventions should target strategies to diagnosis rectal cancer earlier, and once diagnosed, closer surveillance for recurrence may be warranted.",Comparative Study,3219.0,34.0,Recent population-based studies have highlighted a disproportionate increase in the incidence of cancer among adults younger than aged 50 years To determine whether different intervention and surveillance strategies might be needed for younger patients the patterns of care and oncologic outcomes among adults younger than aged 50 years with cancer were investigated A cohort of 333 young 50 years patients with sporadic cancer was compared to a contemporaneous cohort of 675 older 65 years patients for differences in disease pattern treatments received and long-term disease-free survival DFS Patient and tumor characteristics did not differ between groups except for an increased presence of signet-ring and mucinous histology in young patients Younger patients presented with more advanced-stage disease stages III and IV 59.4 vs. 46.4 p 0.016 More young patients received sphincter-preservation procedures 63.4 vs. 55.4 p 0.016 radiation 61.6 vs. 42.1 p 0.001 and chemotherapy 67.3 vs. 47.6 p 0.001 Fewer young patients were free from recurrent disease at the last follow-up 72.1 vs. 82.5 p 0.001 The stage-specific 5-year DFS did not differ between the young and older cohorts Only stage and the need for chemotherapy independently predicted poor DFS Young patients present at a later stage and a greater proportion develop distant disease recurrence over time However their stage-specific oncologic outcomes appear similar to those in older-onset patients To have the greatest impact on long-term oncologic outcomes in patients with young-onset cancer future interventions should target strategies to diagnosis cancer earlier and once diagnosed closer surveillance for recurrence may be warranted,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[435, 266, 90, 94, 47, 3681, 8, 14156, 344, 4, 3, 287, 1, 12, 107, 857, 773, 76, 1032, 212, 60, 6, 223, 317, 338, 788, 2, 617, 422, 822, 40, 575, 9, 773, 7, 3, 764, 1, 165, 2, 1998, 123, 107, 857, 773, 76, 1032, 212, 60, 5, 12, 11, 565, 8, 180, 1, 9616, 1169, 212, 60, 7, 5, 1928, 12, 10, 72, 6, 8, 11633, 180, 1, 9908, 434, 556, 60, 7, 9, 362, 4, 34, 1177, 640, 103, 2, 319, 337, 34, 115, 25, 1010, 69, 2, 30, 374, 205, 44, 1505, 59, 271, 2187, 9, 35, 101, 463, 1, 5489, 4091, 2, 2391, 784, 4, 1169, 7, 773, 7, 917, 5, 80, 131, 82, 34, 1153, 316, 2, 478, 728, 39, 105, 641, 39, 19, 13, 3820, 80, 1169, 7, 103, 5400, 2224, 1369, 676, 39, 105, 614, 39, 19, 13, 3820, 121, 713, 49, 105, 595, 14, 19, 13, 144, 2, 56, 598, 27, 105, 662, 49, 19, 13, 144, 1497, 1169, 7, 11, 115, 29, 387, 34, 28, 3, 1060, 166, 126, 720, 14, 105, 878, 33, 19, 13, 144, 3, 82, 112, 33, 111, 1010, 205, 44, 1505, 59, 3, 1169, 2, 434, 736, 158, 82, 2, 3, 594, 9, 56, 1042, 783, 334, 1010, 1169, 7, 364, 28, 8, 1559, 82, 2, 8, 378, 920, 690, 626, 34, 146, 252, 98, 137, 136, 82, 112, 1998, 123, 1322, 288, 6, 135, 4, 434, 1707, 7, 6, 47, 3, 2199, 345, 23, 319, 337, 1998, 123, 4, 7, 5, 1169, 1707, 12, 508, 1151, 257, 283, 422, 6, 147, 12, 1677, 2, 1059, 265, 6576, 617, 9, 146, 68, 40, 1197]",1703.0,21448750,377

Evaluation of ¹⁸F-FDG-PET for early detection of suboptimal response of rectal cancer to preoperative chemoradiotherapy: a prospective analysis.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2011-04-08,"Early identification of inadequate response to preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) may spare rectal cancer patients the toxicity of ineffective treatment. We prospectively evaluated tumor response with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) early in the course of preoperative CRT. A total of 27 prospectively accrued patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (T(3-4)/N(1)) received preoperative CRT (5040 cGy + 5FU-based chemotherapy). Patients underwent PET scanning before and 8-14 days after commencement of CRT. Scans were interpreted using 3 standard parameters: SUV(max), SUV(avg), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) as well as an investigational parameter: visual response score (VRS). Percent pathologic response was quantified as a continuous variable. All PET parameters were correlated with pathology. Pathologic complete/near-complete response was defined as ≥95% tumor destruction, suboptimal response as <95%. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Of the 27 patients, 11 (41%) had pathologic complete/near-complete response; 16 (59%) had suboptimal response. SUV(max), SUV(avg), and TLG did not discriminate between responders and nonresponders. Visual response score (VRS) was statistically significantly higher for complete/near-complete responders than for suboptimal responders (65 vs. 33%, P = 0.02). Suboptimal responders were identified with 94% sensitivity and 78% accuracy using a VRS cut-off of 50%.

Reduced acute bowel toxicity in patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy for rectal cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2011-04-07,"We have previously shown that intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) can reduce dose to small bowel, bladder, and bone marrow compared with three-field conventional radiotherapy (CRT) technique in the treatment of rectal cancer. The purpose of this study was to review our experience using IMRT to treat rectal cancer and report patient clinical outcomes. A retrospective review was conducted of patients with rectal cancer who were treated at Mayo Clinic Arizona with pelvic radiotherapy (RT). Data regarding patient and tumor characteristics, treatment, acute toxicity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 3.0, tumor response, and perioperative morbidity were collected. From 2004 to August 2009, 92 consecutive patients were treated. Sixty-one (66%) patients were treated with CRT, and 31 (34%) patients were treated with IMRT. All but 2 patients received concurrent chemotherapy. There was no significant difference in median dose (50.4 Gy, CRT; 50 Gy, IMRT), preoperative vs. postoperative treatment, type of concurrent chemotherapy, or history of previous pelvic RT between the CRT and IMRT patient groups. Patients who received IMRT had significantly less gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Sixty-two percent of patients undergoing CRT experienced ≥Grade 2 acute GI side effects, compared with 32% among IMRT patients (p = 0.006). The reduction in overall GI toxicity was attributable to fewer symptoms from the lower GI tract. Among CRT patients, ≥Grade 2 diarrhea and enteritis was experienced among 48% and 30% of patients, respectively, compared with 23% (p = 0.02) and 10% (p = 0.015) among IMRT patients. There was no significant difference in hematologic or genitourinary acute toxicity between groups. In addition, pathologic complete response rates and postoperative morbidity between treatment groups did not differ significantly. In the management of rectal cancer, IMRT is associated with a clinically significant reduction in lower GI toxicity compared with CRT. Further study is needed to evaluate differences in late toxicity and long-term efficacy.",Comparative Study,3211.0,117.0,We have previously shown that intensity-modulated radiotherapy IMRT can reduce dose to small bowel and marrow compared with three-field conventional radiotherapy CRT technique in the treatment of cancer The purpose of this study was to review our experience using IMRT to treat cancer and report patient clinical outcomes A retrospective review was conducted of patients with cancer who were treated at Mayo Clinic Arizona with pelvic radiotherapy RT Data regarding patient and tumor characteristics treatment acute toxicity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 3.0 tumor response and perioperative morbidity were collected From 2004 to August 2009 92 consecutive patients were treated Sixty-one 66 patients were treated with CRT and 31 34 patients were treated with IMRT All but 2 patients received concurrent chemotherapy There was no significant difference in median dose 50.4 Gy CRT 50 Gy IMRT preoperative vs. postoperative treatment type of concurrent chemotherapy or history of previous pelvic RT between the CRT and IMRT patient groups Patients who received IMRT had significantly less GI toxicity Sixty-two percent of patients undergoing CRT experienced ≥Grade 2 acute GI side effects compared with 32 among IMRT patients p 0.006 The reduction in overall GI toxicity was attributable to fewer symptoms from the lower GI tract Among CRT patients ≥Grade 2 diarrhea and enteritis was experienced among 48 and 30 of patients respectively compared with 23 p 0.02 and 10 p 0.015 among IMRT patients There was no significant difference in hematologic or genitourinary acute toxicity between groups In addition pathologic complete response rates and postoperative morbidity between treatment groups did not differ significantly In the management of cancer IMRT is associated with a clinically significant reduction in lower GI toxicity compared with CRT Further study is needed to evaluate differences in late toxicity and long-term efficacy,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[21, 47, 373, 443, 17, 837, 1757, 310, 964, 122, 969, 61, 6, 302, 1659, 2, 581, 72, 5, 169, 1067, 809, 310, 1089, 1312, 4, 3, 24, 1, 12, 3, 743, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 206, 114, 730, 75, 964, 6, 943, 12, 2, 414, 69, 38, 123, 8, 459, 206, 10, 426, 1, 7, 5, 12, 54, 11, 73, 28, 2486, 1188, 16349, 5, 1110, 310, 240, 74, 666, 69, 2, 30, 374, 24, 286, 155, 768, 6, 3, 186, 3462, 371, 9, 290, 281, 603, 27, 13, 30, 51, 2, 1547, 787, 11, 786, 29, 1131, 6, 2480, 1238, 937, 935, 7, 11, 73, 1746, 104, 700, 7, 11, 73, 5, 1089, 2, 456, 562, 7, 11, 73, 5, 964, 62, 84, 18, 7, 103, 750, 56, 125, 10, 77, 93, 523, 4, 52, 61, 212, 39, 381, 1089, 212, 381, 964, 498, 105, 573, 24, 267, 1, 750, 56, 15, 532, 1, 698, 1110, 240, 59, 3, 1089, 2, 964, 69, 271, 7, 54, 103, 964, 42, 97, 299, 2104, 155, 1746, 100, 714, 1, 7, 479, 1089, 592, 9140, 18, 286, 2104, 1152, 176, 72, 5, 531, 107, 964, 7, 19, 13, 1861, 3, 628, 4, 63, 2104, 155, 10, 2971, 6, 1497, 507, 29, 3, 280, 2104, 1696, 107, 1089, 7, 9140, 18, 1172, 2, 16393, 10, 592, 107, 576, 2, 201, 1, 7, 106, 72, 5, 382, 19, 13, 588, 2, 79, 19, 13, 3433, 107, 964, 7, 125, 10, 77, 93, 523, 4, 813, 15, 4109, 286, 155, 59, 271, 4, 352, 510, 236, 51, 151, 2, 573, 787, 59, 24, 271, 205, 44, 1505, 97, 4, 3, 284, 1, 12, 964, 16, 41, 5, 8, 505, 93, 628, 4, 280, 2104, 155, 72, 5, 1089, 195, 45, 16, 575, 6, 376, 362, 4, 807, 155, 2, 319, 337, 209]",1971.0,21477938,311
Initial experience with transanal endoscopic microsurgery: the need for understanding the limitations.,Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,J. Gastrointest. Surg.,2011-04-09,"Transanal endoscopic microsurgery is an alternative to transanal excision or radical surgery for benign and carefully selected malignant rectal tumors. Advantages over transanal excision include better visualization, access to more proximal lesions, higher likelihood of negative margins, and lower recurrence rates. Compared to radical resection, patients experience lower rates of morbidity and mortality but may have higher rates of local recurrence. A review of a prospectively maintained database of patients scheduled for transanal endoscopic microsurgery was performed. Ninety-three patients underwent 96 procedures for 13 carcinoid tumors, 1 submucosal mass, 46 adenomas, 12 in situ adenocarcinomas, and 21 invasive adenocarcinomas. Of these cases, 81.2% was successfully completed. There were nine complications (11.5%). Final pathology demonstrated 33 in situ and invasive adenocarcinomas. The mean follow-up was 25.9 months. The four recurrences (12.1%) occurred in: one tubulovillous adenoma, two in situ carcinomas, and one T2 lesion. Transanal endoscopic microsurgery is appropriate for benign lesions such as carcinoid tumors and adenomas and can also be curative in carefully selected patients with early-stage invasive rectal cancer.

"Association of CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) alterations, body mass index, and physical activity with survival in patients with colorectal cancer.",JAMA,JAMA,2011-04-01,"Alterations of the WNT signaling pathway and cadherin-associated protein β 1 (CTNNB1 or β-catenin) have been implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis and metabolic diseases. To test the hypothesis that CTNNB1 activation in colorectal cancer modifies prognostic associations of body mass index (BMI) and level of postdiagnosis physical activity. Two US prospective cohort studies (Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study) were used to evaluate CTNNB1 localization by immunohistochemistry in 955 patients with stage I, II, III, or IV colon and rectal cancer from 1980 through 2004. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to compute the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality, adjusting for clinical and tumor features, including microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, level of long interspersed nucleotide element 1 methylation, mutations in KRAS, BRAF, or PIK3CA, and tumor protein p53. Colorectal cancer-specific mortality and overall mortality through June 30, 2009. In obese patients (BMI ≥30), positive status for nuclear CTNNB1 was associated with significantly better colorectal cancer-specific survival (adjusted HR, 0.24 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.12-0.49], P <.001 for interaction; 5-year survival: 0.85 for patients with positive nuclear CTNNB1 status vs 0.78 for those with negative status) and overall survival (adjusted HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.35-0.90], P = .03 for interaction; 5-year survival: 0.77 for patients with positive nuclear CTNNB1 status vs 0.74 for those with negative status), while CTNNB1 status was not associated with prognosis among nonobese patients (BMI <30). Among patients with negative status for nuclear CTNNB1 and cancer in stages I, II, or III, postdiagnosis physical activity was associated with better colorectal cancer-specific survival (adjusted HR, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.13-0.81], P = .05 for interaction; 5-year survival: 0.97 for ≥18 vs 0.89 for <18 metabolic equivalent task hours/week), while postdiagnosis physical activity was not associated with colorectal cancer-specific survival among patients with positive status for nuclear CTNNB1 (adjusted HR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.50-2.30]).

Biomarkers for cetuximab-based neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2011-05-10,"Phase II trials in locally advanced rectal cancer have shown that cetuximab-based neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy is feasible but without an improvement in complete pathologic response rates. Our goal was to identify patients who would benefit from cetuximab-based neoadjuvant chemoradiation measuring gene expression levels of proteins involved in tumor growth [endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR)], angiogenesis [VEGF, VEGF receptors 1 and 2 (VEGFR1, VEGFR2)], DNA repair [excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1)], and drug metabolism [thymidylate synthetase (TS)]. We also determined mutation status of KRAS and BRAF. This study was carried out on 130 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who were enrolled in 4 different phase II clinical trials, using cetuximab-based chemoradiation. Tumor tissues were obtained before neoadjuvant and at surgical therapy. After microdissection, intratumoral gene expression levels and KRAS/BRAF mutation status were analyzed. A significant decrease of TS, VEGFR1, and VEGFR2 gene expression was seen following neoadjuvant therapy (P < 0.03). High pretreatment VEGF gene expression levels were associated with nonresponse (P = 0.070). KRAS mutations were found in 42% and mutant KRAS (KRAS mt) was significantly associated with pathologic nonresponse (P = 0.037). In patients with wild-type KRAS (KRAS wt), low EGFR was significantly associated with higher nonresponse and VEGF mRNA expressions were associated with complete pathologic response (P = 0.012; P = 0.06). KRAS transversion (KRAS tv) was associated with tumor regression: nonresponse was more common in patients with KRAS tv than with KRAS wt (P = 0.007). BRAF V600E mutations were not detected in any of the patients. This study suggests that pretreatment intratumoral EGFR and VEGF mRNA expression levels as well as KRAS mutation status are predictive markers of pathologic response to neoadjuvant cetuximab-based chemoradiation in locally advanced rectal cancer.",Evaluation Study,3178.0,36.0,Phase II trials in locally advanced cancer have shown that cetuximab-based neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy is feasible but without an improvement in complete pathologic response rates Our goal was to identify patients who would benefit from cetuximab-based neoadjuvant chemoradiation measuring gene expression levels of proteins involved in tumor growth endothelial growth factor receptor EGFR angiogenesis VEGF VEGF receptors 1 and 2 VEGFR1 VEGFR2 DNA repair excision repair cross-complementing 1 ERCC1 and drug metabolism thymidylate synthetase TS We also determined mutation status of KRAS and BRAF This study was carried out on 130 patients with locally advanced cancer who were enrolled in 4 different phase II clinical trials using cetuximab-based chemoradiation Tumor tissues were obtained before neoadjuvant and at surgical therapy After microdissection intratumoral gene expression levels and KRAS/BRAF mutation status were analyzed A significant decrease of TS VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 gene expression was seen following neoadjuvant therapy P 0.03 High pretreatment VEGF gene expression levels were associated with nonresponse P 0.070 KRAS mutations were found in 42 and mutant KRAS KRAS mt was significantly associated with pathologic nonresponse P 0.037 In patients with wild-type KRAS KRAS wt low EGFR was significantly associated with higher nonresponse and VEGF mRNA expressions were associated with complete pathologic response P 0.012 P 0.06 KRAS transversion KRAS tv was associated with tumor regression nonresponse was more common in patients with KRAS tv than with KRAS wt P 0.007 BRAF V600E mutations were not detected in any of the patients This study suggests that pretreatment intratumoral EGFR and VEGF mRNA expression levels as well as KRAS mutation status are predictive markers of pathologic response to neoadjuvant cetuximab-based chemoradiation in locally advanced cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[124, 215, 143, 4, 795, 131, 12, 47, 443, 17, 1175, 90, 536, 6836, 16, 1313, 84, 187, 35, 767, 4, 236, 510, 51, 151, 114, 1326, 10, 6, 255, 7, 54, 688, 247, 29, 1175, 90, 536, 975, 2978, 145, 55, 148, 1, 652, 646, 4, 30, 129, 845, 129, 161, 153, 227, 1056, 618, 618, 1186, 14, 2, 18, 7952, 4609, 261, 972, 1366, 972, 1383, 10455, 14, 4023, 2, 234, 1600, 6205, 12692, 3527, 21, 120, 509, 258, 156, 1, 723, 2, 566, 26, 45, 10, 2629, 1205, 23, 3431, 7, 5, 795, 131, 12, 54, 11, 346, 4, 39, 338, 124, 215, 38, 143, 75, 1175, 90, 975, 30, 742, 11, 683, 348, 536, 2, 28, 221, 36, 50, 8338, 2074, 145, 55, 148, 2, 723, 566, 258, 156, 11, 311, 8, 93, 775, 1, 3527, 7952, 2, 4609, 145, 55, 10, 527, 366, 536, 36, 19, 13, 680, 64, 1194, 618, 145, 55, 148, 11, 41, 5, 15511, 19, 13, 12006, 723, 138, 11, 204, 4, 595, 2, 620, 723, 723, 4875, 10, 97, 41, 5, 510, 15511, 19, 13, 5171, 4, 7, 5, 955, 267, 723, 723, 1820, 154, 227, 10, 97, 41, 5, 142, 15511, 2, 618, 956, 4249, 11, 41, 5, 236, 510, 51, 19, 13, 3499, 19, 13, 1460, 723, 19065, 723, 7953, 10, 41, 5, 30, 320, 15511, 10, 80, 186, 4, 7, 5, 723, 7953, 76, 5, 723, 1820, 19, 13, 1999, 566, 2047, 138, 11, 44, 530, 4, 500, 1, 3, 7, 26, 45, 844, 17, 1194, 2074, 227, 2, 618, 956, 55, 148, 22, 149, 22, 723, 258, 156, 32, 464, 525, 1, 510, 51, 6, 536, 1175, 90, 975, 4, 795, 131, 12]",1892.0,21558395,159
Recurrence rates and prognostic factors in ypN0 rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiation and total mesorectal excision.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2011-05-18,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy is typically recommended for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Patients with pathologically node-negative tumors have an improved prognosis, but recurrence patterns and independent prognostic factors in these patients have been incompletely characterized. Using a retrospective cohort study design, we included all rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation and curative surgery from 1993 through 2003, who had ypN0 tumors. We characterized recurrence rates and patterns in patients not treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Secondarily, we compared them to patients who did receive adjuvant treatment and assessed for independent prognostic factors, using univariate and multivariable survival analyses. Overall, 324 ypN0 patients (ypT0: n = 73; ypT1-2: n = 130; ypT3-4: n = 120) were followed for a median of 5.8 years. The risk of recurrence was associated with pathologic stage-2.7% ypT0, 12.3% ypT1-2, 24.2%ypT3-4. Five-year recurrence-free survival in patients who did not receive adjuvant treatment was 100% (ypT0), 84.4% (ypT1-2) and 75% (ypT3-4). There was no significant difference in 5-year recurrence-free survival between patients who did and did not receive adjuvant treatment. In multivariable analysis, pathologic stage was the factor most strongly associated with recurrence (hazard ratio 3.6 for ypT3-4 vs. ypT0-2, 95% confidence interval 1.9-6.7, P < 0.0001). The recurrence rates for selected patients with ypT0-2N0 rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiation and total mesorectal excision are low. Although standard practice remains completion of planned postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for all patients undergoing chemoradiation, these data suggest prospective trials may be warranted to measure the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in favorable subgroups, such as ypT0-2N0.",Journal Article,3170.0,27.0,Neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy is typically recommended for patients with locally advanced cancer Patients with pathologically node-negative tumors have an improved prognosis but recurrence patterns and independent prognostic factors in these patients have been incompletely characterized Using a retrospective cohort study design we included all cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation and curative surgery from 1993 through 2003 who had ypN0 tumors We characterized recurrence rates and patterns in patients not treated with adjuvant chemotherapy Secondarily we compared them to patients who did receive adjuvant treatment and assessed for independent prognostic factors using univariate and multivariable survival analyses Overall 324 ypN0 patients ypT0 n 73 ypT1-2 n 130 ypT3-4 n 120 were followed for a median of 5.8 years The risk of recurrence was associated with pathologic stage-2.7 ypT0 12.3 ypT1-2 24.2 ypT3-4 Five-year recurrence-free survival in patients who did not receive adjuvant treatment was 100 ypT0 84.4 ypT1-2 and 75 ypT3-4 There was no significant difference in 5-year recurrence-free survival between patients who did and did not receive adjuvant treatment In multivariable analysis pathologic stage was the factor most strongly associated with recurrence hazard ratio 3.6 for ypT3-4 vs. ypT0-2 95 confidence interval 1.9-6.7 P 0.0001 The recurrence rates for selected patients with ypT0-2N0 cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiation and total mesorectal excision are low Although standard practice remains completion of planned postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for all patients undergoing chemoradiation these data suggest prospective trials may be warranted to measure the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in favorable subgroups such as ypT0-2N0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[536, 975, 370, 20, 152, 2, 249, 56, 16, 1969, 793, 9, 7, 5, 795, 131, 12, 7, 5, 2998, 289, 199, 57, 47, 35, 231, 356, 84, 146, 764, 2, 306, 177, 130, 4, 46, 7, 47, 85, 5252, 765, 75, 8, 459, 180, 45, 771, 21, 159, 62, 12, 7, 73, 5, 536, 975, 2, 1075, 152, 29, 3343, 298, 1522, 54, 42, 10484, 57, 21, 765, 146, 151, 2, 764, 4, 7, 44, 73, 5, 249, 56, 12974, 21, 72, 1370, 6, 7, 54, 205, 560, 249, 24, 2, 275, 9, 306, 177, 130, 75, 880, 2, 658, 25, 318, 63, 8393, 10484, 7, 9607, 78, 803, 22463, 18, 78, 3431, 16915, 39, 78, 2031, 11, 370, 9, 8, 52, 1, 33, 66, 60, 3, 43, 1, 146, 10, 41, 5, 510, 82, 18, 67, 9607, 133, 27, 22463, 18, 259, 18, 16915, 39, 365, 111, 146, 115, 25, 4, 7, 54, 205, 44, 560, 249, 24, 10, 394, 9607, 874, 39, 22463, 18, 2, 481, 16915, 39, 125, 10, 77, 93, 523, 4, 33, 111, 146, 115, 25, 59, 7, 54, 205, 2, 205, 44, 560, 249, 24, 4, 658, 65, 510, 82, 10, 3, 161, 96, 1327, 41, 5, 146, 360, 197, 27, 49, 9, 16915, 39, 105, 9607, 18, 48, 307, 268, 14, 83, 49, 67, 19, 13, 488, 3, 146, 151, 9, 715, 7, 5, 9607, 12881, 12, 50, 536, 975, 2, 181, 5823, 1366, 32, 154, 242, 260, 758, 469, 1438, 1, 1465, 573, 249, 56, 9, 62, 7, 479, 975, 46, 74, 309, 482, 143, 68, 40, 1197, 6, 1463, 3, 247, 1, 249, 56, 4, 913, 1453, 225, 22, 9607, 12881]",1830.0,21590450,631
Local excision: is it an adequate substitute for radical resection in T1/T2 patients?,Seminars in radiation oncology,Semin Radiat Oncol,2011-07-01,"Local excision (LE) was historically developed to palliate patients with rectal adenocarcinoma who either are medically unfit or have adamantly refused to undergo transabdominal standard resection (SR) procedures. Over the years, the tradeoffs between the oncologic benefit and adverse functional sequelae associated with SR procedures have been increasingly recognized. In parallel, there has been growing interest in considering LE as an alternative to SR in select patients with early-stage disease. However, concerns regarding its oncologic adequacy remain. These concerns relate to the adequacy of tumor resection, the removal of mesorectal disease, the accuracy of preoperative selection, and the use of adjunctive treatment modalities.

T3N0 rectal cancer: radiation for all?,Seminars in radiation oncology,Semin Radiat Oncol,2011-07-01,"The optimal oncologic management for patients with T3N0 rectal cancer is currently controversial. Patients with pathologic T3N0 disease may have an ""intermediate"" risk of disease recurrence, suggesting that perhaps trimodality therapy may not be indicated for all patients. Adverse prognostic features, including a greater depth of perirectal fat invasion, poor tumor differentiation, the presence of lymphovascular invasion, abnormally elevated pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen levels (>5 ng/mL), circumferential margin involvement, and a low-lying position may identify T3N0 patients at high risk for local recurrence who may benefit from the addition of radiation therapy. However, recent randomized data suggest an improvement in local control and disease-free survival with preoperative radiation therapy compared with selective postoperative radiation therapy in all patient subgroups, arguing in favor of routine preoperative therapy. Additionally, rates of clinical understaging may exceed 20%, representing the percentage of patients who would require the delivery of postoperative radiotherapy with its associated sequelae.

Quality of care for older patients with cancer in the Veterans Health Administration versus the private sector: a cohort study.,Annals of internal medicine,Ann. Intern.

Studies suggest that the VHA provides better preventive care and care for some chronic illnesses than does the private sector.

Observational study of patients with cancer that was diagnosed between 2001 and 2004 who were followed through 2005. VHA and non-VHA hospitals and office-based practices. Men older than 65 years with incident colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer; lymphoma; or multiple myeloma. Rates of processes of care for colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer; lymphoma; or multiple myeloma. Rates were adjusted by using propensity score weighting. Compared with the fee-for-service Medicare population, the VHA population received diagnoses of colon (P < 0.001) and rectal (P = 0.007) cancer at earlier stages and had higher adjusted rates of curative surgery for colon cancer (92.7% vs. 90.5%; P < 0.010), standard chemotherapy for diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (71.1% vs. 59.3%; P < 0.001), and bisphosphonate therapy for multiple myeloma (62.1% vs. 50.4%; P < 0.001). The VHA population had lower adjusted rates of 3-dimensional conformal or intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer treated with external-beam radiation therapy (61.6% vs. 86.0%; P < 0.001). Adjusted rates were similar for 9 other measures. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if patients with cancer in the VHA system have more severe comorbid illness than other patients, rates for most indicators would be higher in the VHA population than in the fee-for-service Medicare population. This study included only older men and did not include information about performance status, severity of comorbid illness, or patient preferences.

Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT): differences in target volumes and improvement in clinically relevant doses to small bowel in rectal carcinoma.,"Radiation oncology (London, England)",Radiat Oncol,2011-06-08,"A strong dose-volume relationship exists between the amount of small bowel receiving low- to intermediate-doses of radiation and the rates of acute, severe gastrointestinal toxicity, principally diarrhea. There is considerable interest in the application of highly conformal treatment approaches, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), to reduce dose to adjacent organs-at-risk in the treatment of carcinoma of the rectum. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive dosimetric evaluation of IMRT compared to 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) in standard, preoperative treatment for rectal cancer. Using RTOG consensus anorectal contouring guidelines, treatment volumes were generated for ten patients treated preoperatively at our institution for rectal carcinoma, with IMRT plans compared to plans derived from classic anatomic landmarks, as well as 3DCRT plans treating the RTOG consensus volume. The patients were all T3, were node-negative (N = 1) or node-positive (N = 9), and were planned to a total dose of 45-Gy. Pairwise comparisons were made between IMRT and 3DCRT plans with respect to dose-volume histogram parameters. IMRT plans had superior PTV coverage, dose homogeneity, and conformality in treatment of the gross disease and at-risk nodal volume, in comparison to 3DCRT. Additionally, in comparison to the 3DCRT plans, IMRT achieved a concomitant reduction in doses to the bowel (small bowel mean dose: 18.6-Gy IMRT versus 25.2-Gy 3DCRT; p = 0.005), bladder (V40Gy: 56.8% IMRT versus 75.4% 3DCRT; p = 0.005), pelvic bones (V40Gy: 47.0% IMRT versus 56.9% 3DCRT; p = 0.005), and femoral heads (V40Gy: 3.4% IMRT versus 9.1% 3DCRT; p = 0.005), with an improvement in absolute volumes of small bowel receiving dose levels known to induce clinically-relevant acute toxicity (small bowel V15Gy: 138-cc IMRT versus 157-cc 3DCRT; p = 0.005). We found that the IMRT treatment volumes were typically larger than that covered by classic bony landmark-derived fields, without incurring penalty with respect to adjacent organs-at-risk. For rectal carcinoma, IMRT, compared to 3DCRT, yielded plans superior with respect to target coverage, homogeneity, and conformality, while lowering dose to adjacent organs-at-risk.

Comparative toxicity and dosimetric profile of whole-pelvis versus prostate bed-only intensity-modulated radiation therapy after prostatectomy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2011-06-12,"To assess whether whole-pelvis (WP) intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for prostate cancer (PCa) after prostatectomy is associated with increased toxicity compared to prostate-bed only (PB) IMRT. All patients (n = 67) undergoing postprostatectomy IMRT to 70.2 Gy at our institution from January 2006 to January 2009 with minimum 12-month follow-up were divided into WP (n = 36) and PB (n = 31) comparison groups. WP patients received initial pelvic nodal IMRT to 45 Gy. Pretreatment demographics, bladder and rectal dose-volume histograms, and maximum genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities were compared. Logistic regression models evaluated uni- and multivariate associations between pretreatment demographics and toxicities. Pretreatment demographics including age and comorbidities were similar between groups. WP patients had higher Gleason scores, T stages, and preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, and more WP patients underwent androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). WP minimum (Dmin) and mean bladder doses, bladder volumes receiving more than 5 Gy (V5) and V20, rectal Dmin, and PB bladder and rectal V65 were significantly increased. Maximum acute GI toxicity was Grade 2 and was increased for WP (61%) vs. PB (29%) patients (p = 0.001); there was no significant difference in acute Grade ≥2 GU toxicity (22% WP vs. 10% PB; p = 0.193), late Grade ≥2 GI toxicity (3% WP vs. 0% PB; p = 0.678), or late Grade ≥2 GU toxicity (28% WP vs. 19% PB; p = 0.274) with 25-month median follow-up (range, 12-44 months). On multivariate analysis, long-term ADT use was associated with Grade ≥2 late GU toxicity (p = 0.02).

EGF61 polymorphism predicts complete pathologic response to cetuximab-based chemoradiation independent of KRAS status in locally advanced rectal cancer patients.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2011-06-14,"Cetuximab has shown significant clinical activity in metastatic colon cancer. However, cetuximab-containing neoadjuvant chemoradiation has not been shown to improve tumor response in locally advanced rectal cancer patients in recent phase I/II trials. We evaluated functional germline polymorphisms of genes involved in epidermal growth factor receptor pathway, angiogenesis, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, DNA repair, and drug metabolism, for their potential role as molecular predictors for clinical outcome in locally advanced rectal cancer patients treated with preoperative cetuximab-based chemoradiation. 130 patients (74 men and 56 women) with locally advanced rectal cancer (4 with stage II, 109 with stage III, and 15 with stage IV, 2 unknown) who were enrolled in phase I/II clinical trials treated with cetuximab-based chemoradiation in European cancer centers were included. Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples and genotyping was done by using PCR-RFLP assays. Fisher's exact test was used to examine associations between polymorphisms and complete pathologic response (pCR) that was determined by a modified Dworak classification system (grade III vs. grade IV: complete response). Patients with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) 61 G/G genotype had pCR of 45% (5/11), compared with 21% (11/53) in patients heterozygous, and 2% (1/54) in patients homozygous for the A/A allele (P < 0.001). In addition, this association between EGF 61 G allele and pCR remained significant (P = 0.019) in the 59 patients with wild-type KRAS.

Statin use and colorectal cancer risk according to molecular subtypes in two large prospective cohort studies.,"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",Cancer Prev Res (Phila),2011-06-16,"Use of statins is hypothesized to reduce colorectal cancer risk but the evidence remains inconsistent. This may be partly explained by differential associations according to tumor location or molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer. We examined the association between statin use and colorectal cancer risk according to tumor location, KRAS mutation status, microsatellite instability (MSI) status, PTGS2 (COX-2) expression, or CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) status in two large prospective cohort studies, the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study. We applied Cox regression to a competing risks analysis. We identified 1,818 colorectal cancers during 1990 to 2006. Compared with nonusers, current statin use was not associated with colorectal cancer [relative risk (RR) = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.86-1.14] or colon cancer (RR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.94-1.29) but was inversely associated with rectal cancer (RR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.41-0.84, P(heterogeneity) < 0.001).

Adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival in patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage II colon cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2011-06-20,"It is unclear whether the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival in patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage II colon cancer. The authors used the State of California Cancer Surveillance Program (CSP) to assess patients ages 18 to 80 years with AJCC stage II colon cancer (ie, T3 or T4 and N0) who underwent surgical resection during 1991 and 2006. Patients who had rectal and rectosigmoid cancers were excluded. The cohort was stratified according to the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy, and clinical and pathologic characteristics and outcomes were assessed. From the CSP data, 3716 patients were identified who underwent curative-intent surgical resection for stage II colon cancer. When the 2 treatment groups (surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy [n = 916] and surgery alone [n = 2800]) were compared, patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy were more likely to be younger and to have left-sided lesions with ≥ 12 lymph nodes examined. There was no difference in sex or tumor differentiation between the 2 groups. According to a Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy had improved overall survival compared with patients who underwent surgery alone (median survival, 12 years vs 9.2 years, respectively; P < .001). In multivariate analysis, adjuvant chemotherapy was identified as an independent predictor of improved survival (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.99; P = .031).

Survival and prognostic factors were analyzed. There were 112 patients who underwent resection of L+L (mean 2 liver, 2 lung metastases). Mean tumor sizes were 3 cm and 1 cm, respectively.

Inverse association of eosinophil count with colorectal cancer incidence: atherosclerosis risk in communities study.,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev.,2011-07-08,"Allergic conditions are associated with reduced risk of several malignancies. We hypothesized that blood eosinophil count, a marker for allergic disorders, is inversely associated with the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities prospective cohort. To our knowledge, the association between blood eosinophil count and cancer risk has not been investigated before. Relative eosinophil and total leukocyte counts were measured in blood at baseline. Absolute eosinophil counts were calculated by multiplying relative count by the total leukocyte count. Proportional hazards regression provided HRs and 95% CIs of CRC in relation to eosinophil count. From 1987-2006, 242 incident CRC cases (187 colon and 56 rectal) occurred in 10,675 initially cancer-free participants. In a multivariate-adjusted model, HRs were 1.0, 0.70 (95% CI: 0.50-0.98) and 0.58 (95% CI: 0.40-0.83) across tertiles of absolute eosinophil count (P(trend) = 0.003).

A phase II trial of neoadjuvant chemoradiation and local excision for T2N0 rectal cancer: preliminary results of the ACOSOG Z6041 trial.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2011-07-14,"We designed American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z6041, a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, phase II trial to assess the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT) and local excision (LE) for T2N0 rectal cancer. Here, we report tumor response, CRT-related toxicity, and perioperative complications (PCs). Clinically staged T2N0 rectal cancer patients were treated with capecitabine and oxaliplatin during radiation followed by LE. Because of toxicity, capecitabine and radiation doses were reduced. LE was performed 6 weeks after CRT. Patients were evaluated for clinical and pathologic response. CRT-related complications and PCs were recorded. Ninety patients were accrued; 6 received nonprotocol treatment. The remaining 84 were 65% male; median age 63 years; 83% Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score 0; 92% white; mean tumor size 2.9 cm; and average distance from anal verge 5.1 cm. Five patients were considered ineligible. Therapy was completed per protocol in 79 patients, but two patients did not undergo LE. Among 77 eligible patients who underwent LE, 34 patients achieved a pathologic complete response (44%) and 49 (64%) tumors were downstaged (ypT0-1), but 4 patients (5%) had ypT3 tumors. Five LE specimens contained lymph nodes; one T3 tumor had a positive node. All but one patient had negative margins. Thirty-three (39%) of 84 patients developed CRT-related grade ≥3 complications. Rectal pain was the most common PC. CRT before LE for T2N0 tumors results in a high pathologic complete response rate and negative resection margins. However, complications during CRT and after LE are high.

The current landscape of locally advanced rectal cancer.,Nature reviews. Clinical oncology,Nat Rev Clin Oncol,2011-08-09,"Postoperative adjuvant chemoradiotherapy was recommended as the standard treatment for patients with rectal cancer because it reduces local recurrence. This paradigm shifted with the use of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, which not only reduces local recurrence but also improves sphincter preservation and surgical outcomes. However, the treatment of rectal carcinoma remains complicated. The accuracy of tumor staging can be compromised depending on the imaging modality used. The addition of modern chemotherapeutics and biologics to 5-fluorouracil as radiation sensitizers is questionable. Oxaliplatin as a radiation sensitizer has minimal effects on the pathologic complete response, but improves the radiographical response at the expense of an increased risk of toxicities. The role of biologics in addition to radiation therapy continues to be explored. Attention has focused on improving diagnostic imaging, radiation oncology, and surgical techniques, treatment regimens, and on exploring a role of molecular markers for patients with rectal cancers.

A prospective study of intakes of zinc and heme iron and colorectal cancer risk in men and women.,Cancer causes & control : CCC,Cancer Causes Control,2011-09-11,"Although laboratory studies linked zinc and heme iron to colorectal cancer, epidemiologic evidence is limited. We prospectively examined these associations in the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study. We used Cox proportional hazards regression analyses to calculate cohort-specific relative risks (RRs) and pooled results using a fixed-effects model. We documented 2,114 incident colorectal cancer cases during up to 22 years of follow-up. Compared highest to lowest quintile of dietary zinc intake, the pooled multivariable RRs (95% CIs) were 0.86 (0.73, 1.02) for colorectal cancer, 0.92 (0.76, 1.11) for colon cancer, and 0.68 (0.47, 0.99) for rectal cancer. The significant inverse association between dietary zinc intake and risk of rectal cancer was mainly driven by data in women, although the difference in the sex-specific results was not statistically significant. For the same comparison, the pooled multivariable RRs (95% CIs) for heme iron were 1.10 (0.93, 1.30) for colorectal cancer, 1.06 (0.88, 1.29) for colon cancer, and 1.20 (0.83, 1.75) for rectal cancer.

"TGFBR2 and BAX mononucleotide tract mutations, microsatellite instability, and prognosis in 1072 colorectal cancers.",PloS one,PLoS ONE,2011-09-20,"Mononucleotide tracts in the coding regions of the TGFBR2 and BAX genes are commonly mutated in microsatellite instability-high (MSI-high) colon cancers. The receptor TGFBR2 plays an important role in the TGFB1 (transforming growth factor-β, TGF-β) signaling pathway, and BAX plays a key role in apoptosis. However, a role of TGFBR2 or BAX mononucleotide mutation in colorectal cancer as a prognostic biomarker remains uncertain. We utilized a database of 1072 rectal and colon cancers in two prospective cohort studies (the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study). Cox proportional hazards model was used to compute mortality hazard ratio (HR), adjusted for clinical, pathological and molecular features including the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), LINE-1 methylation, and KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations. MSI-high was observed in 15% (162/1072) of all colorectal cancers. TGFBR2 and BAX mononucleotide mutations were detected in 74% (117/159) and 30% (48/158) of MSI-high tumors, respectively. In Kaplan-Meier analysis as well as univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, compared to microsatellite stable (MSS)/MSI-low cases, MSI-high cases were associated with superior colorectal cancer-specific survival [adjusted HR, 0.34; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.20-0.57] regardless of TGFBR2 or BAX mutation status. Among MSI-high tumors, TGFBR2 mononucleotide mutation was associated with CIMP-high independent of other variables [multivariate odds ratio, 3.57; 95% CI, 1.66-7.66; p = 0.0011].

Challenging the feasibility and clinical significance of current guidelines on lymph node examination in rectal cancer in the era of neoadjuvant therapy.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2011-10-11,"We sought to examine the feasibility and clinical significance of current guidelines on nodal assessment in patients with rectal cancer (RC) treated with neoadjuvant radiation. All patients with RC treated with curative surgery from 1991 to 2003 were included. Number of lymph nodes (LNs) assessed was compared between patients who received neoadjuvant therapy and surgery (NEO) and patients who underwent surgery alone (SURG). Impact of node retrieval on node positivity and disease-specific survival (DSS) in NEO patients was assessed. In total, 708 patients were identified, of whom 429 (61%) were in the NEO group. These patients had significantly fewer nodes assessed than SURG patients (unadjusted mean, 10.8 v 15.5; adjusted mean difference, -5.0 nodes; P < .001). In the NEO group, 63% of patients had fewer than 12 nodes retrieved (P < .001 v SURG). The proportion of patients diagnosed with node-positive disease in the NEO group was significantly and monotonically associated with the number of lymph nodes retrieved, with no plateau in the relationship. Fewer nodes retrieved was not associated with inferior DSS.

"Tumor TP53 expression status, body mass index and prognosis in colorectal cancer.",International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2011-11-19,"Inactivation of the TP53 (p53) pathway by TP53 mutations is one of key steps in colorectal carcinogenesis. TP53 also plays an important role in cellular energy metabolism. We hypothesized that TP53-altered tumor cells might behave aggressively independent of energy balance, while progression of TP53-intact cells might depend on excess energy balance. Utilizing a database of 1,060 colon and rectal cancer patients in two prospective cohort studies, we evaluated TP53 expression by immunohistochemistry. Among 1,060 colorectal cancers, 457 (43%) tumors were positive for TP53. Cox proportional hazards model was used to compute mortality hazard ratio (HR), adjusting for clinical and tumoral features, including microsatellite instability, the CpG island methylator phenotype, LINE-1 methylation, KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA. TP53 positivity was not significantly associated with cancer-specific survival in univariate analysis with HR of 1.16 [95% confidence interval (CI)=0.92-1.45], which became significant after stage adjustment (multivariate HR=1.30; 95% CI=1.02-1.65). Notably, we found a possible modifying effect of patient's body mass index (BMI) on tumor TP53. In non-obese patients (BMI<30 kg/m2), TP53 positivity was associated with shorter cancer-specific survival (multivariate HR=1.53; 95% CI=1.17-2.00), while TP53 positivity was not significantly associated with survival among obese patients (BMI≥30 kg/m2). Effect of TP53 positivity on cancer-specific survival significantly differed by BMI (pinteraction=0.0051). The adverse effect of obesity on patient mortality was limited to TP53-negative patients. These molecular pathological epidemiology data may support a dual role of TP53 alterations in cell-cycle deregulation and cell autonomy with respect to energy balance status.",Journal Article,2985.0,43.0,"Inactivation of the TP53 p53 pathway by TP53 mutations is one of key steps in carcinogenesis TP53 also plays an important role in cellular energy metabolism We hypothesized that TP53-altered tumor cells might behave aggressively independent of energy balance while progression of TP53-intact cells might depend on excess energy balance Utilizing a database of 1,060 and cancer patients in two prospective cohort studies we evaluated TP53 expression by immunohistochemistry Among 1,060 cancers 457 43 tumors were positive for TP53 Cox proportional hazards model was used to compute mortality hazard ratio HR adjusting for clinical and tumoral features including microsatellite instability the CpG island methylator phenotype LINE-1 methylation KRAS BRAF and PIK3CA TP53 positivity was not significantly associated with cancer-specific survival in univariate analysis with HR of 1.16 95 confidence interval CI =0.92-1.45 which became significant after stage adjustment multivariate HR=1.30 95 CI=1.02-1.65 Notably we found a possible modifying effect of patient 's body mass index BMI on tumor TP53 In non-obese patients BMI 30 kg/m2 TP53 positivity was associated with shorter cancer-specific survival multivariate HR=1.53 95 CI=1.17-2.00 while TP53 positivity was not significantly associated with survival among obese patients BMI≥30 kg/m2 Effect of TP53 positivity on cancer-specific survival significantly differed by BMI pinteraction=0.0051 The adverse effect of obesity on patient mortality was limited to TP53-negative patients These molecular pathological epidemiology data may support a dual role of TP53 alterations in cell-cycle deregulation and cell autonomy with respect to energy balance status",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[2297, 1, 3, 1206, 624, 308, 20, 1206, 138, 16, 104, 1, 825, 4022, 4, 1719, 1206, 120, 1698, 35, 305, 200, 4, 763, 2803, 1600, 21, 1237, 17, 1206, 1495, 30, 37, 822, 10403, 8503, 306, 1, 2803, 3459, 369, 91, 1, 1206, 2964, 37, 822, 4533, 23, 2612, 2803, 3459, 2600, 8, 609, 1, 14, 9972, 2, 12, 7, 4, 100, 482, 180, 94, 21, 194, 1206, 55, 20, 888, 107, 14, 9972, 163, 13372, 601, 57, 11, 109, 9, 1206, 418, 831, 1017, 202, 10, 95, 6, 9577, 282, 360, 197, 168, 1358, 9, 38, 2, 4204, 404, 141, 2226, 1753, 3, 2075, 3454, 5440, 1005, 328, 14, 569, 723, 566, 2, 1506, 1206, 1887, 10, 44, 97, 41, 5, 12, 112, 25, 4, 880, 65, 5, 168, 1, 14, 245, 48, 307, 268, 58, 13, 937, 14, 512, 92, 3451, 93, 50, 82, 1852, 331, 168, 14, 201, 48, 58, 14, 588, 14, 556, 2552, 21, 204, 8, 899, 4898, 254, 1, 69, 292, 642, 782, 558, 1140, 23, 30, 1206, 4, 220, 2209, 7, 1140, 201, 503, 821, 1206, 1887, 10, 41, 5, 985, 12, 112, 25, 331, 168, 14, 699, 48, 58, 14, 269, 18, 2038, 369, 1206, 1887, 10, 44, 97, 41, 5, 25, 107, 2209, 7, 35221, 503, 821, 254, 1, 1206, 1887, 23, 12, 112, 25, 97, 2512, 20, 1140, 8994, 13, 20335, 3, 290, 254, 1, 1661, 23, 69, 282, 10, 383, 6, 1206, 199, 7, 46, 219, 1301, 1284, 74, 68, 538, 8, 1828, 200, 1, 1206, 593, 4, 31, 417, 4765, 2, 31, 14086, 5, 2184, 6, 2803, 3459, 156]",1707.0,22038927,502
Accuracy of endorectal ultrasound for measurement of the closest predicted radial mesorectal margin for rectal cancer.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2012-01-01,"At present, pelvic phased array-coil MR is used as the validated imaging modality for measurement of the closest predicted radial mesorectal margin for rectal cancer. Endorectal ultrasound is also used to assess the clinical stage of the cancer that will determine the recommendation for neoadjuvant chemoradiation, but it has not been used to assess the closest predicted radial margin. We propose to assess endorectal ultrasound identification of mesorectal margins and the measurement of the closest predicted radial tumor-mesorectal margin. Patients included were those having MRI and endorectal ultrasound for evaluation of primary rectal cancer in 2010 at a tertiary cancer referral colorectal clinic. Clinical data, MRI, and endorectal ultrasound images were assessed. Two independent retrospective measurements of mesorectal dimensions were correlated to evaluate the reproducibility of identifying mesorectal margins. MRI and endorectal ultrasound images were compared for independent measurements of mesorectal dimensions and of the closest predicted radial mesorectal margin. MRI and endorectal ultrasound determination of margin involvement were assessed for agreement. Fifty-two patients were studied with an average rectal cancer distance to the anal verge of 6.8 cm. Interobserver correlation coefficients of endorectal ultrasound mesorectal dimensions ranged from 0.47 to 0.53 (p < 0.01). MR and endorectal ultrasound measurements of the closest predicted radial mesorectal margin were correlated r = 0.56 (p < 0.0001). MR and endorectal ultrasound determination of margin involvement agreed in 81% of cases. Endorectal ultrasound has substantial agreement with MR to measure the closest predicted radial tumor-mesorectal margin. Correlations between observers and modalities for identification of mesorectal dimensions are modest. Further assessment is indicated to confirm endorectal ultrasound mesorectal measurements in a larger sample and to understand the advantages and disadvantages relative to MR.",Evaluation Study,2942.0,18.0,At present pelvic phased array-coil MR is used as the validated imaging modality for measurement of the closest predicted radial mesorectal margin for cancer Endorectal ultrasound is also used to assess the clinical stage of the cancer that will determine the recommendation for neoadjuvant chemoradiation but it has not been used to assess the closest predicted radial margin We propose to assess endorectal ultrasound identification of mesorectal margins and the measurement of the closest predicted radial tumor-mesorectal margin Patients included were those having MRI and endorectal ultrasound for evaluation of primary cancer in 2010 at a tertiary cancer referral clinic Clinical data MRI and endorectal ultrasound images were assessed Two independent retrospective measurements of mesorectal dimensions were correlated to evaluate the reproducibility of identifying mesorectal margins MRI and endorectal ultrasound images were compared for independent measurements of mesorectal dimensions and of the closest predicted radial mesorectal margin MRI and endorectal ultrasound determination of margin involvement were assessed for agreement Fifty-two patients were studied with an average cancer distance to the verge of 6.8 cm Interobserver correlation coefficients of endorectal ultrasound mesorectal dimensions ranged from 0.47 to 0.53 p 0.01 MR and endorectal ultrasound measurements of the closest predicted radial mesorectal margin were correlated r 0.56 p 0.0001 MR and endorectal ultrasound determination of margin involvement agreed in 81 of cases Endorectal ultrasound has substantial agreement with MR to measure the closest predicted radial tumor-mesorectal margin Correlations between observers and modalities for identification of mesorectal dimensions are modest Further assessment is indicated to confirm endorectal ultrasound mesorectal measurements in a larger sample and to understand the advantages and disadvantages relative to MR,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[28, 364, 1110, 26369, 1926, 9964, 1638, 16, 95, 22, 3, 938, 270, 1396, 9, 2204, 1, 3, 12197, 783, 6471, 5823, 959, 9, 12, 5615, 1945, 16, 120, 95, 6, 423, 3, 38, 82, 1, 3, 12, 17, 303, 223, 3, 3347, 9, 536, 975, 84, 192, 71, 44, 85, 95, 6, 423, 3, 12197, 783, 6471, 959, 21, 2548, 6, 423, 5615, 1945, 911, 1, 5823, 1012, 2, 3, 2204, 1, 3, 12197, 783, 6471, 30, 5823, 959, 7, 159, 11, 135, 1041, 704, 2, 5615, 1945, 9, 451, 1, 86, 12, 4, 1120, 28, 8, 2557, 12, 2096, 1188, 38, 74, 704, 2, 5615, 1945, 1572, 11, 275, 100, 306, 459, 1685, 1, 5823, 6190, 11, 438, 6, 376, 3, 4688, 1, 1386, 5823, 1012, 704, 2, 5615, 1945, 1572, 11, 72, 9, 306, 1685, 1, 5823, 6190, 2, 1, 3, 12197, 783, 6471, 5823, 959, 704, 2, 5615, 1945, 3104, 1, 959, 799, 11, 275, 9, 2024, 1461, 100, 7, 11, 656, 5, 35, 1011, 12, 3019, 6, 3, 8330, 1, 49, 66, 494, 5393, 816, 5161, 1, 5615, 1945, 5823, 6190, 1869, 29, 13, 662, 6, 13, 699, 19, 13, 355, 1638, 2, 5615, 1945, 1685, 1, 3, 12197, 783, 6471, 5823, 959, 11, 438, 668, 13, 664, 19, 13, 488, 1638, 2, 5615, 1945, 3104, 1, 959, 799, 4681, 4, 865, 1, 140, 5615, 1945, 71, 1281, 2024, 5, 1638, 6, 1463, 3, 12197, 783, 6471, 30, 5823, 959, 2553, 59, 8803, 2, 1558, 9, 911, 1, 5823, 6190, 32, 1721, 195, 455, 16, 1103, 6, 1843, 5615, 1945, 5823, 1685, 4, 8, 1077, 1000, 2, 6, 1640, 3, 3126, 2, 8787, 580, 6, 1638]",1955.0,22156868,93

However, little is known about the prognostic significance of tumor growth pattern, independent of tumoral molecular alterations and other histologic features.

Cox proportional hazard model was used to compute mortality hazard ratio, adjusting for clinical, pathologic, and tumor molecular features, including microsatellite instability, the CpG island methylator phenotype, long interspersed nucleotide element 1 (LINE-1) methylation, and KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations.

Phys.,2011-12-28,"We report a Phase II trial assessing the acute and late toxicities of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), long-term androgen suppression (LTAS), and bevacizumab in patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer. We treated 18 patients with LTAS with bicalutamide and goserelin in combination with bevacizumab and IMRT. Bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) was administered for the first 16 weeks, and 15 mg/kg was then given every 3 weeks for 12 additional weeks, with an IMRT dose of 77.9 Gy to the prostate, 64.6 Gy to the seminal vesicles, and 57 Gy to the pelvic lymph nodes. Patients were eligible if they had clinical stage T2b to T4, a Gleason sum score of 8 to 10, or a prostate- specific antigen level of 20ng/mL or greater. The primary endpoint of the study was evaluation of acute and late toxicities. The median age was 69 years, with a median pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level of 12.5 ng/mL and Gleason score of 8. The pretreatment clinical stage was T1c in 4 patients, T2 in 11, and T3 in 3. All patients completed IMRT with median follow-up of 34 months (range, 28-40 months) The most common Grade 2 or higher toxicities were hypertension (61% of patients with Grade 2 and 11% with Grade 3), proteinuria (28% with Grade 2 and 6% with Grade 3), and leucopenia (28% with Grade 2). No Grade 4 or higher acute toxicities were reported. Late toxicities included proctitis (6% of patients with Grade 2 and 11% with Grade 3), rectal bleeding (6% with Grade 2 and 11% with Grade 3), hematuria (6% with Grade 2), proteinuria (17% with Grade 2), hyponatremia (6% with Grade 3), cystitis (6% with Grade 3), and urinary retention (6% with Grade 2 and 11% with Grade 3). Grade 4 prostatitis occurred in 1 patient (6%). Bevacizumab does not appear to exacerbate the acute effects of IMRT. Late toxicities may have been worsened with this regimen. Further investigations of bevacizumab with LTAS and IMRT should be performed cautiously.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",2946.0,18.0,We report a Phase II trial assessing the acute and late toxicities of intensity-modulated radiation therapy IMRT long-term androgen suppression LTAS and bevacizumab in patients with high-risk localized cancer We treated 18 patients with LTAS with bicalutamide and goserelin in combination with bevacizumab and IMRT Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks was administered for the first 16 weeks and 15 mg/kg was then given every 3 weeks for 12 additional weeks with an IMRT dose of 77.9 Gy to the 64.6 Gy to the seminal vesicles and 57 Gy to the pelvic lymph nodes Patients were eligible if they had clinical stage T2b to T4 a Gleason sum score of 8 to 10 or a prostate- specific antigen level of 20ng/mL or greater The primary endpoint of the study was evaluation of acute and late toxicities The median age was 69 years with a median pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level of 12.5 ng/mL and Gleason score of 8 The pretreatment clinical stage was T1c in 4 patients T2 in 11 and T3 in 3 All patients completed IMRT with median follow-up of 34 months range 28-40 months The most common Grade 2 or higher toxicities were hypertension 61 of patients with Grade 2 and 11 with Grade 3 proteinuria 28 with Grade 2 and 6 with Grade 3 and leucopenia 28 with Grade 2 No Grade 4 or higher acute toxicities were reported Late toxicities included proctitis 6 of patients with Grade 2 and 11 with Grade 3 bleeding 6 with Grade 2 and 11 with Grade 3 hematuria 6 with Grade 2 proteinuria 17 with Grade 2 hyponatremia 6 with Grade 3 cystitis 6 with Grade 3 and urinary retention 6 with Grade 2 and 11 with Grade 3 Grade 4 prostatitis occurred in 1 patient 6 Bevacizumab does not appear to exacerbate the acute effects of IMRT Late toxicities may have been worsened with this regimen Further investigations of bevacizumab with LTAS and IMRT should be performed cautiously,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[21, 414, 8, 124, 215, 160, 1977, 3, 286, 2, 807, 385, 1, 837, 1757, 121, 36, 964, 319, 337, 687, 1332, 39856, 2, 599, 4, 7, 5, 64, 43, 909, 12, 21, 73, 203, 7, 5, 39856, 5, 6797, 2, 12555, 4, 150, 5, 599, 2, 964, 599, 79, 81, 503, 454, 18, 244, 10, 468, 9, 3, 157, 245, 244, 2, 167, 81, 503, 10, 818, 447, 454, 27, 244, 9, 133, 402, 244, 5, 35, 964, 61, 1, 849, 83, 381, 6, 3, 660, 49, 381, 6, 3, 4786, 7634, 2, 696, 381, 6, 3, 1110, 263, 502, 7, 11, 625, 492, 491, 42, 38, 82, 9023, 6, 2463, 8, 1406, 3216, 368, 1, 66, 6, 79, 15, 8, 1364, 112, 448, 301, 1, 35267, 542, 15, 378, 3, 86, 1138, 1, 3, 45, 10, 451, 1, 286, 2, 807, 385, 3, 52, 89, 10, 790, 60, 5, 8, 52, 1194, 1364, 112, 448, 301, 1, 133, 33, 997, 542, 2, 1406, 368, 1, 66, 3, 1194, 38, 82, 10, 8152, 4, 39, 7, 1786, 4, 175, 2, 2065, 4, 27, 62, 7, 781, 964, 5, 52, 166, 126, 1, 562, 53, 184, 339, 327, 53, 3, 96, 186, 88, 18, 15, 142, 385, 11, 1824, 713, 1, 7, 5, 88, 18, 2, 175, 5, 88, 27, 5381, 339, 5, 88, 18, 2, 49, 5, 88, 27, 2, 10317, 339, 5, 88, 18, 77, 88, 39, 15, 142, 286, 385, 11, 210, 807, 385, 159, 17612, 49, 1, 7, 5, 88, 18, 2, 175, 5, 88, 27, 2294, 49, 5, 88, 18, 2, 175, 5, 88, 27, 7798, 49, 5, 88, 18, 5381, 269, 5, 88, 18, 6672, 49, 5, 88, 27, 13032, 49, 5, 88, 27, 2, 1660, 3947, 49, 5, 88, 18, 2, 175, 5, 88, 27, 88, 39, 16794, 489, 4, 14, 69, 49, 599, 1097, 44, 1322, 6, 11910, 3, 286, 176, 1, 964, 807, 385, 68, 47, 85, 5890, 5, 26, 477, 195, 2492, 1, 599, 5, 39856, 2, 964, 257, 40, 173, 16332]",1855.0,22208976,169
"Prostate cancer screening in the randomized Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial: mortality results after 13 years of follow-up.",Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2012-01-06,"The prostate component of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial was undertaken to determine whether there is a reduction in prostate cancer mortality from screening using serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and digital rectal examination (DRE). Mortality after 7-10 years of follow-up has been reported previously. We report extended follow-up to 13 years after the trial. A total of 76 685 men, aged 55-74 years, were enrolled at 10 screening centers between November 1993 and July 2001 and randomly assigned to the intervention (organized screening of annual PSA testing for 6 years and annual DRE for 4 years; 38 340 men) and control (usual care, which sometimes included opportunistic screening; 38 345 men) arms. Screening was completed in October 2006. All incident prostate cancers and deaths from prostate cancer through 13 years of follow-up or through December 31, 2009, were ascertained. Relative risks (RRs) were estimated as the ratio of observed rates in the intervention and control arms, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated assuming a Poisson distribution for the number of events. Poisson regression modeling was used to examine the interactions with respect to prostate cancer mortality between trial arm and age, comorbidity status, and pretrial PSA testing. All statistical tests were two-sided. Approximately 92% of the study participants were followed to 10 years and 57% to 13 years. At 13 years, 4250 participants had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in the intervention arm compared with 3815 in the control arm. Cumulative incidence rates for prostate cancer in the intervention and control arms were 108.4 and 97.1 per 10 000 person-years, respectively, resulting in a relative increase of 12% in the intervention arm (RR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.07 to 1.17). After 13 years of follow-up, the cumulative mortality rates from prostate cancer in the intervention and control arms were 3.7 and 3.4 deaths per 10 000 person-years, respectively, resulting in a non-statistically significant difference between the two arms (RR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.87 to 1.36). No statistically significant interactions with respect to prostate cancer mortality were observed between trial arm and age (P(interaction) = .81), pretrial PSA testing (P(interaction) = .52), and comorbidity (P(interaction) = .68). After 13 years of follow-up, there was no evidence of a mortality benefit for organized annual screening in the PLCO trial compared with opportunistic screening, which forms part of usual care, and there was no apparent interaction with age, baseline comorbidity, or pretrial PSA testing.",Journal Article,2937.0,688.0,The component of the and PLCO Cancer Screening Trial was undertaken to determine whether there is a reduction in cancer mortality from screening using serum prostate-specific antigen PSA testing and digital examination DRE Mortality after 7-10 years of follow-up has been reported previously We report extended follow-up to 13 years after the trial A total of 76 685 men aged 55-74 years were enrolled at 10 screening centers between November 1993 and July 2001 and randomly assigned to the intervention organized screening of annual PSA testing for 6 years and annual DRE for 4 years 38 340 men and control usual care which sometimes included opportunistic screening 38 345 men arms Screening was completed in October 2006 All incident cancers and deaths from cancer through 13 years of follow-up or through December 31 2009 were ascertained Relative risks RRs were estimated as the ratio of observed rates in the intervention and control arms and 95 confidence intervals CIs were calculated assuming a Poisson distribution for the number of events Poisson regression modeling was used to examine the interactions with respect to cancer mortality between trial arm and age comorbidity status and pretrial PSA testing All statistical tests were two-sided Approximately 92 of the study participants were followed to 10 years and 57 to 13 years At 13 years 4250 participants had been diagnosed with cancer in the intervention arm compared with 3815 in the control arm Cumulative incidence rates for cancer in the intervention and control arms were 108.4 and 97.1 per 10 000 person-years respectively resulting in a relative increase of 12 in the intervention arm RR 1.12 95 CI 1.07 to 1.17 After 13 years of follow-up the cumulative mortality rates from cancer in the intervention and control arms were 3.7 and 3.4 deaths per 10 000 person-years respectively resulting in a non-statistically significant difference between the two arms RR 1.09 95 CI 0.87 to 1.36 No statistically significant interactions with respect to cancer mortality were observed between trial arm and age P interaction .81 pretrial PSA testing P interaction .52 and comorbidity P interaction .68 After 13 years of follow-up there was no evidence of a mortality benefit for organized annual screening in the PLCO trial compared with opportunistic screening which forms part of usual care and there was no apparent interaction with age baseline comorbidity or pretrial PSA testing,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[3, 1249, 1, 3, 2, 9299, 12, 453, 160, 10, 2789, 6, 223, 317, 125, 16, 8, 628, 4, 12, 282, 29, 453, 75, 524, 1364, 112, 448, 534, 471, 2, 3271, 1385, 8627, 282, 50, 67, 79, 60, 1, 166, 126, 71, 85, 210, 373, 21, 414, 1747, 166, 126, 6, 233, 60, 50, 3, 160, 8, 181, 1, 846, 13123, 325, 1032, 614, 794, 60, 11, 346, 28, 79, 453, 1168, 59, 2868, 3343, 2, 2066, 1758, 2, 1108, 896, 6, 3, 788, 7511, 453, 1, 2114, 534, 471, 9, 49, 60, 2, 2114, 8627, 9, 39, 60, 519, 7264, 325, 2, 182, 3521, 165, 92, 5164, 159, 10026, 453, 519, 9005, 325, 1335, 453, 10, 781, 4, 2551, 1324, 62, 2631, 163, 2, 1043, 29, 12, 298, 233, 60, 1, 166, 126, 15, 298, 1397, 456, 1238, 11, 5240, 580, 1098, 4739, 11, 661, 22, 3, 197, 1, 164, 151, 4, 3, 788, 2, 182, 1335, 2, 48, 307, 1582, 1927, 11, 981, 7242, 8, 7668, 1395, 9, 3, 207, 1, 281, 7668, 320, 2057, 10, 95, 6, 1004, 3, 1286, 5, 2184, 6, 12, 282, 59, 160, 475, 2, 89, 1879, 156, 2, 19965, 534, 471, 62, 1050, 895, 11, 100, 1689, 705, 937, 1, 3, 45, 776, 11, 370, 6, 79, 60, 2, 696, 6, 233, 60, 28, 233, 60, 46976, 776, 42, 85, 265, 5, 12, 4, 3, 788, 475, 72, 5, 60971, 4, 3, 182, 475, 967, 287, 151, 9, 12, 4, 3, 788, 2, 182, 1335, 11, 3590, 39, 2, 1015, 14, 379, 79, 984, 2719, 60, 106, 1113, 4, 8, 580, 344, 1, 133, 4, 3, 788, 475, 861, 14, 133, 48, 58, 14, 1615, 6, 14, 269, 50, 233, 60, 1, 166, 126, 3, 967, 282, 151, 29, 12, 4, 3, 788, 2, 182, 1335, 11, 27, 67, 2, 27, 39, 1043, 379, 79, 984, 2719, 60, 106, 1113, 4, 8, 220, 712, 93, 523, 59, 3, 100, 1335, 861, 14, 1730, 48, 58, 13, 912, 6, 14, 511, 77, 712, 93, 1286, 5, 2184, 6, 12, 282, 11, 164, 59, 160, 475, 2, 89, 19, 915, 865, 19965, 534, 471, 19, 915, 653, 2, 1879, 19, 915, 806, 50, 233, 60, 1, 166, 126, 125, 10, 77, 241, 1, 8, 282, 247, 9, 7511, 2114, 453, 4, 3, 9299, 160, 72, 5, 10026, 453, 92, 2377, 760, 1, 3521, 165, 2, 125, 10, 77, 2235, 915, 5, 89, 330, 1879, 15, 19965, 534, 471]",2449.0,22228146,1
Reverse-hybrid robotic mesorectal excision for rectal cancer.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2012-02-01,"The robotic system offers potential technical advantages over laparoscopy for total mesorectal excision with radical lymphadenectomy for rectal cancer. However, the requirement for fixed docking limits its utility when the working volume is large or patient repositioning is required. The purpose of this study was to evaluate short-term outcomes associated with a novel setup to perform total mesorectal excision and radical lymphadenectomy for rectal cancer by the use of a ""reverse"" hybrid robotic-laparoscopic approach. This is a prospective consecutive cohort observational study of patients who underwent robotic rectal cancer resection from January 2009 to March 2011. During the study period, a technique of reverse-hybrid robotic-laparoscopic rectal resection with radical lymphadenectomy was developed. This technique involves reversal of the operative sequence with lymphovascular and rectal dissection to precede proximal colonic mobilization. This technique evolved from a conventional-hybrid resection with laparoscopic vascular control, colonic mobilization, and robotic pelvic dissection. Perioperative and short-term oncologic outcomes were analyzed. Thirty patients underwent reverse-hybrid resection. Median tumor location was 5 cm (interquartile range 3-9) from the anal verge. Median BMI was 27.6 (interquartile range 25.0-32.1 kg/m). Twenty (66.7%) received neoadjuvant chemoradiation. There were no conversions. Median blood loss was 100 mL (interquartile range 75-200).

Cancer control and functional outcomes of salvage radical prostatectomy for radiation-recurrent prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.,European urology,Eur. Urol.,2012-01-23,"Prostate cancer (PCa) recurrence following definitive radiation therapy (RT) remains a vexing challenge for the practicing physician. Salvage radical prostatectomy (SRP) has not been recognized yet as a valuable therapeutic option. We critically analyzed the currently available evidence on SRP as to patient selection, predictive oncologic factors, surgical technique, cancer control, surgical complications, functional outcomes, and comparison to other salvage therapies. A systematic review of the literature was performed in June 2011 using the Medline, Embase, and Web of Science databases, limiting the review to English-language articles published between January 1980 and June 2011. All authors reviewed the list of references and added papers relevant to the topic of the review prior to the analysis. The panel selected 40 articles according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. Positive surgical margins in SRP varied from 43% to 70% in earlier publications versus 0-36% in recent publications, and pathologic organ-confined disease (OCD) was found in 22-53% versus 44-73% in earlier versus recent publications. Biochemical recurrence-free probability after SRP ranged from 47% to 82% at 5 yr and from 28% to 53% at 10 yr. Cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival varied from 70% to 83% and 54% to 89% at 10 yr. Pre-SRP prostate-specific antigen value and prostate biopsy Gleason score were the strongest prognostic risk factors for progression-free survival, OCD, and CSS. Open, laparoscopic, and robotic techniques were shown to be feasible in the hands of experienced surgeons. The most frequent complications included anastomotic stricture (7-41%) followed by rectal injury (0-28%). Major complications (modified Clavien classification grade 3-5) varied from 0% to 25%. Most complications were less frequent in more recent series, except for anastomotic stricture. The majority of patients had erectile dysfunction prior to SRP (50-91%) and 80-100% after SRP. Urinary continence ranged from 21% to 90% after surgery. Limitations of this review include the absence of prospective studies and lack of comparative analyses between SRP and other therapies. In selected patients with confirmed, localized, radiation-recurrent PCa, SRP may effectively promote durable cancer control with acceptable associated surgical morbidity and variable functional recovery.",Journal Article,2920.0,129.0,cancer PCa recurrence following definitive radiation therapy RT remains a vexing challenge for the practicing physician Salvage radical prostatectomy SRP has not been recognized yet as a valuable therapeutic option We critically analyzed the currently available evidence on SRP as to patient selection predictive oncologic factors surgical technique cancer control surgical complications functional outcomes and comparison to other salvage therapies A systematic review of the literature was performed in June 2011 using the Medline Embase and Web of Science databases limiting the review to English-language articles published between January 1980 and June 2011 All authors reviewed the list of references and added papers relevant to the topic of the review prior to the analysis The panel selected 40 articles according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses PRISMA criteria Positive surgical margins in SRP varied from 43 to 70 in earlier publications versus 0-36 in recent publications and pathologic organ-confined disease OCD was found in 22-53 versus 44-73 in earlier versus recent publications Biochemical recurrence-free probability after SRP ranged from 47 to 82 at 5 yr and from 28 to 53 at 10 yr.

Body mass index and risk of colorectal cancer according to fatty acid synthase expression in the nurses' health study.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2012-02-06,"Fatty acid synthase (FASN) plays an important role in energy metabolism of fatty acids and is overexpressed in some colon cancers. We investigated whether associations between body mass index (BMI) and risk of colorectal cancer varied according to FASN expression. During follow-up of 109,051 women in the ongoing prospective Nurses' Health Study, a total of 1351 incident colon and rectal cancers were diagnosed between 1986 and 2004. We constructed tissue microarrays of the available resected tumor samples (n = 536), and FASN expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. All statistical tests were two-sided. High BMI was associated with an increased risk of FASN-negative (no or weak expression) colorectal cancer compared with normal BMI (high BMI [≥ 30 kg/m(2)], ie, obese vs normal BMI [18.5-22.9 kg/m(2)], HR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.49 to 3.40, P(trend) < .001) but not with FASN-positive (moderate to strong expression) colorectal cancer. A statistically significant heterogeneity in colorectal cancer risks was observed between FASN-negative and FASN-positive tumors (P(heterogeneity) = .033). The age-adjusted incidence rates for FASN-positive and FASN-negative colorectal cancers were 10.9 and 7.1, respectively, per 100,000 person-years.

Have the changes in treatment of rectal cancer made a significant difference to our patients?,"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)","Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",2011-12-01,"The treatment for patients with locally advanced, resectable rectal cancer has evolved over the years. Various combinations and sequences of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and total mesorectal excision (TME)-based surgery are the mainstay of current therapy. Preoperative combined chemoradiation, followed by surgery, is now the preferred treatment strategy, with the majority of patients receiving either infusion fluorouracil (5-FU) or capecitabine (Xeloda) with radiation.

Immortal time bias: a frequently unrecognized threat to validity in the evaluation of postoperative radiotherapy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-02-16,"To evaluate the influence of immortal time bias on observational cohort studies of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) and the effectiveness of sequential landmark analysis to account for this bias. First, we reviewed previous studies of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to determine how frequently this bias was considered. Second, we used SEER to select three tumor types (glioblastoma multiforme, Stage IA-IVM0 gastric adenocarcinoma, and Stage II-III rectal carcinoma) for which prospective trials demonstrated an improvement in survival associated with PORT. For each tumor type, we calculated conditional survivals and adjusted hazard ratios of PORT vs. postoperative observation cohorts while restricting the sample at sequential monthly landmarks. Sixty-two percent of previous SEER publications evaluating PORT failed to use a landmark analysis. As expected, delivery of PORT for all three tumor types was associated with improved survival, with the largest associated benefit favoring PORT when all patients were included regardless of survival. Preselecting a cohort with a longer minimum survival sequentially diminished the apparent benefit of PORT. Although the majority of previous SEER articles do not correct for it, immortal time bias leads to altered estimates of PORT effectiveness, which are very sensitive to landmark selection.

Prognostic role of PIK3CA mutation in colorectal cancer: cohort study and literature review.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2012-02-22,"Mutations in PIK3CA [the gene encoding the p110α catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)] play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis. Experimental evidence suggests that PIK3CA exon 9 and exon 20 mutations trigger different biologic effects, and that concomitant mutations in both exons 9 and 20 synergistically enhance tumorigenic effects. Thus, we hypothesized that PIK3CA exon 9 and exon 20 mutations might have differential effects on clinical outcome in colorectal cancer, and that concomitant PIK3CA exon 9 and 20 mutations might confer aggressive tumor behavior. We sequenced PIK3CA by pyrosequencing in 1,170 rectal and colon cancers in two prospective cohort studies, and found 189 (16%) PIK3CA mutated tumors. Mortality HR according to PIK3CA status was computed using Cox proportional hazards model, adjusting for clinical and molecular features, including microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, LINE-1 methylation, and BRAF and KRAS mutations. Compared with PIK3CA wild-type cases, patients with concomitant PIK3CA mutations in exons 9 and 20 experienced significantly worse cancer-specific survival [log-rank P = 0.031; multivariate HR = 3.51; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.28-9.62] and overall survival (log-rank P = 0.0008; multivariate HR = 2.68; 95% CI: 1.24-5.77). PIK3CA mutation in either exon 9 or 20 alone was not significantly associated with patient survival. No significant interaction of PIK3CA mutation with BRAF or KRAS mutation was observed in survival analysis.

Predicting pathological response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer using 18FDG-PET/CT.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2012-03-07,"Pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT) has been observed in 15-30% of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). The objective of this study was to determine whether PET/CT can predict pCR and disease-free survival in patients receiving CRT with LARC. This is a retrospective review of patients with EUS-staged T3-T4, N+rectal tumors treated with CRT, who underwent pre/post-treatment PET/CT from 2002-2009. All patients were treated with CRT and surgical resection. Standardized uptake value (SUV) of each tumor was recorded. Logistic regression was used to analyze the association of pre-CRT SUV, post-CRT SUV, %SUV change, and time between CRT and surgery, compared with pCR. Kaplan-Meier estimation evaluated significant predictors of survival. Seventy patients (age 62 years; 42M:28F) with preoperative stage T3 (n=61) and T4 (n=9) underwent pre- and post-CRT PET/CT followed by surgery. The pCR rate was 26%. Median pre-CRT SUV was 10.8, whereas the median post-CRT SUV was 4 (P=0.001). Patients with pCR had a lower median post-CRT SUV compared with those without (2.7 vs. 4.5, P=0.01). Median SUV decrease was 63% (7.5-95.5%) and predicted pCR (P=0.002). Patients with a pCR had a greater time interval between CRT and surgery (median, 58 vs. 50 days) than those without (P=0.02). Patients with post-CRT SUV<4 had a lower recurrence compared with those without (P=0.03). Patients with SUV decrease≥63% had improved overall survival at median follow-up of 40 months than those without (P=0.006). PET/CT can predict response to CRT in patients with LARC.

MR imaging for preoperative evaluation of primary rectal cancer: practical considerations.,"Radiographics : a review publication of the Radiological Society of North America, Inc",Radiographics,,"High-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging plays a pivotal role in the pretreatment assessment of primary rectal cancer. The success of this technique depends on obtaining good-quality high-resolution T2-weighted images of the primary tumor; the mesorectal fascia, peritoneal reflection, and other pelvic viscera; and superior rectal and pelvic sidewall lymph nodes. Although orthogonal axial high-resolution T2-weighted MR images are the cornerstone for the staging of primary rectal cancer, high-resolution sagittal and coronal images provide additional value, particularly in tumors that arise in a redundant tortuous rectum. Coronal high-resolution T2-weighted MR images also improve the assessment of nodal morphology, particularly for superior rectal and pelvic sidewall nodes, and of the relationship between advanced-stage tumors and adjacent pelvic structures. Rectal gel should be used in MR imaging examinations conducted for the staging of polypoid tumors, previously treated lesions, and small rectal tumors.

Pretreatment high-resolution rectal MRI and treatment response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2012-04-01,"Use of rectal MRI evaluation of patients with rectal cancer for primary tumor staging and for identification for poor prognostic features is increasing. MR imaging permits precise delineation of tumor anatomy and assessment of mesorectal tumor penetration and radial margin risk. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of pretreatment rectal MRI to classify tumor response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation. This study is a retrospective, consecutive cohort study and central review. This study was conducted at a tertiary academic hospital. Sixty-two consecutive patients with locally advanced (stage cII to cIII) rectal cancer who underwent rectal cancer protocol high-resolution MRI before surgery (December 2009 to March 2011) were included. The primary outcomes measured were the probability of good (ypT0-2N0) vs poor (≥ypT3N0) response as a function of mesorectal tumor depth, lymph node status, extramural vascular invasion, and grade assessed by uni- and multivariate logistic regression. Tumor response was good in 25 (40.3%) and poor in 37 (59.7%). Median interval from MRI to surgery was 7.9 weeks (interquartile range, 7.0-9.0). MRI tumor depth was <1 mm in 10 (16.9%), 1 to 5 mm in 30 (50.8%), and >5 mm in 21 (33.9%). Lymph node status was positive in 40 (61.5%), and vascular invasion was present in 16 (25.8%). Tumor response was associated with MRI tumor depth (p = 0.001), MRI lymph node status (p < 0.001) and vascular invasion (p = 0.009). Multivariate regression indicated >5 mm MRI tumor depth (OR = 0.08; 95% CI = 0.01-0.93; p = 0.04) and MRI lymph node positivity (OR = 0.12; 95% CI = 0.03-0.53; p = 0.005) were less likely to achieve a good response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Generalizability is uncertain in centers with limited experience with MRI staging for rectal cancer. MRI assessment of tumor depth and lymph node status in rectal cancer is associated to tumor response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. These factors should therefore be considered for stratification of patients for novel treatment strategies reliant on pathologic response to treatment or for the selection of poor-risk patients for intensified treatment regimens.",Journal Article,2851.0,17.0,Use of MRI evaluation of patients with cancer for primary tumor staging and for identification for poor prognostic features is increasing MR imaging permits precise delineation of tumor anatomy and assessment of mesorectal tumor penetration and radial margin risk The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of pretreatment MRI to classify tumor response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation This study is a retrospective consecutive cohort study and central review This study was conducted at a tertiary academic hospital Sixty-two consecutive patients with locally advanced stage cII to cIII cancer who underwent cancer protocol high-resolution MRI before surgery December 2009 to March 2011 were included The primary outcomes measured were the probability of good ypT0-2N0 vs poor ≥ypT3N0 response as a function of mesorectal tumor depth lymph node status extramural vascular invasion and grade assessed by uni- and multivariate logistic regression Tumor response was good in 25 40.3 and poor in 37 59.7 Median interval from MRI to surgery was 7.9 weeks interquartile range 7.0-9.0 MRI tumor depth was 1 mm in 10 16.9 1 to 5 mm in 30 50.8 and 5 mm in 21 33.9 Lymph node status was positive in 40 61.5 and vascular invasion was present in 16 25.8 Tumor response was associated with MRI tumor depth p 0.001 MRI lymph node status p 0.001 and vascular invasion p 0.009 Multivariate regression indicated 5 mm MRI tumor depth OR 0.08 95 CI 0.01-0.93 p 0.04 and MRI lymph node positivity OR 0.12 95 CI 0.03-0.53 p 0.005 were less likely to achieve a good response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy Generalizability is uncertain in centers with limited experience with MRI staging for cancer MRI assessment of tumor depth and lymph node status in cancer is associated to tumor response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy These factors should therefore be considered for stratification of patients for novel treatment strategies reliant on pathologic response to treatment or for the selection of poor-risk patients for intensified treatment regimens,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[119, 1, 704, 451, 1, 7, 5, 12, 9, 86, 30, 632, 2, 9, 911, 9, 334, 177, 404, 16, 602, 1638, 270, 8504, 3260, 5529, 1, 30, 5081, 2, 455, 1, 5823, 30, 4618, 2, 6471, 959, 43, 3, 1130, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 376, 3, 801, 1, 1194, 704, 6, 4896, 30, 51, 6, 536, 975, 26, 45, 16, 8, 459, 935, 180, 45, 2, 854, 206, 26, 45, 10, 426, 28, 8, 2557, 1916, 702, 1746, 100, 935, 7, 5, 795, 131, 82, 47131, 6, 29274, 12, 54, 208, 12, 1182, 64, 2125, 704, 348, 152, 1397, 1238, 6, 2363, 1132, 11, 159, 3, 86, 123, 644, 11, 3, 1320, 1, 1178, 9607, 12881, 105, 334, 61250, 51, 22, 8, 343, 1, 5823, 30, 2436, 263, 289, 156, 47132, 756, 578, 2, 88, 275, 20, 11024, 2, 331, 812, 320, 30, 51, 10, 1178, 4, 243, 327, 27, 2, 334, 4, 567, 728, 67, 52, 268, 29, 704, 6, 152, 10, 67, 83, 244, 2899, 184, 67, 13, 83, 13, 704, 30, 2436, 10, 14, 321, 4, 79, 245, 83, 14, 6, 33, 321, 4, 201, 212, 66, 2, 33, 321, 4, 239, 466, 83, 263, 289, 156, 10, 109, 4, 327, 713, 33, 2, 756, 578, 10, 364, 4, 245, 243, 66, 30, 51, 10, 41, 5, 704, 30, 2436, 19, 13, 144, 704, 263, 289, 156, 19, 13, 144, 2, 756, 578, 19, 13, 2376, 331, 320, 1103, 33, 321, 704, 30, 2436, 15, 13, 1592, 48, 58, 13, 355, 13, 966, 19, 13, 755, 2, 704, 263, 289, 1887, 15, 13, 133, 48, 58, 13, 680, 13, 699, 19, 13, 1614, 11, 299, 322, 6, 1359, 8, 1178, 51, 6, 536, 1464, 10214, 16, 2717, 4, 1168, 5, 383, 730, 5, 704, 632, 9, 12, 704, 455, 1, 30, 2436, 2, 263, 289, 156, 4, 12, 16, 41, 6, 30, 51, 6, 536, 1464, 46, 130, 257, 673, 40, 515, 9, 1541, 1, 7, 9, 229, 24, 422, 14803, 23, 510, 51, 6, 24, 15, 9, 3, 881, 1, 334, 43, 7, 9, 7311, 24, 472]",2040.0,22426259,96
FDG-PET assessment of rectal cancer response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is not associated with long-term prognosis: a prospective evaluation.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2012-04-01,"At present there is no defined role for routine FDG-PET in the preoperative evaluation of nonmetastatic rectal cancer. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of FDG-PET to predict long-term prognosis based on the response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. This was a prospective study. This study was performed at an academic, tertiary care, comprehensive cancer center. One hundred twenty-seven patients with locally advanced rectal cancer were enrolled between September 1999 and December 2005. All patients underwent FDG-PET scans before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. FDG-PET parameters were evaluated by at least 2 study board-certified nuclear medicine physicians, and included mean standard uptake value, maximum standard uptake value, total lesion glycolysis, and visual response score. The main outcome measures were time to recurrence and disease-specific survival. Of 127 patients, 82 (65%) were men, the median age was 60 years (range, 27-82), 110 patients had stage II/III disease, and 17 patients had stage IV disease. Median follow-up among survivors was 77 months (range, 1-115 months). Nine patients had unresectable metastatic disease and were excluded from the time-to-recurrence analysis. At 5 years, 74% (95% CI = 66%-81%) of patients had not had recurrences (locally and/or distantly). The 5-year disease-specific survival was 89% (95% CI = 81%-93%). On univariate analysis, visual response score and time to recurrence came closest to having an association (HR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.68-1.01, p = 0.06). On multivariate analysis, the visual response score was not significant (p = 0.85). No FDG-PET parameter was associated with disease-specific survival.

Dose--volume effects on patient-reported acute gastrointestinal symptoms during chemoradiation therapy for rectal cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-03-19,"Research on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in rectal cancer is limited. We examined whether dose-volume parameters of the small bowel and large bowel were associated with patient-reported gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms during 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemoradiation treatment for rectal cancer. 66 patients treated at the Brigham & Women's Hospital or Massachusetts General Hospital between 2006 and 2008 were included. Weekly during treatment, patients completed a questionnaire assessing severity of diarrhea, urgency, pain, cramping, mucus, and tenesmus. The association between dosimetric parameters and changes in overall GI symptoms from baseline through treatment was examined by using Spearman's correlation. Potential associations between these parameters and individual GI symptoms were also explored. The amount of small bowel receiving at least 15 Gy (V15) was significantly associated with acute symptoms (p = 0.01), and other dosimetric parameters ranging from V5 to V45 also trended toward association. For the large bowel, correlations between dosimetric parameters and overall GI symptoms at the higher dose levels from V25 to V45 did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1), and a significant association was seen with rectal pain from V15 to V45 (p < 0.01).

Impact of heterogeneity-based dose calculation using a deterministic grid-based Boltzmann equation solver for intracavitary brachytherapy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-03-19,"To investigate the dosimetric impact of the heterogeneity dose calculation Acuros (Transpire Inc., Gig Harbor, WA), a grid-based Boltzmann equation solver (GBBS), for brachytherapy in a cohort of cervical cancer patients. The impact of heterogeneities was retrospectively assessed in treatment plans for 26 patients who had previously received (192)Ir intracavitary brachytherapy for cervical cancer with computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance-compatible tandems and unshielded colpostats. The GBBS models sources, patient boundaries, applicators, and tissue heterogeneities. Multiple GBBS calculations were performed with and without solid model applicator, with and without overriding the patient contour to 1 g/cm(3) muscle, and with and without overriding contrast materials to muscle or 2.25 g/cm(3) bone. Impact of source and boundary modeling, applicator, tissue heterogeneities, and sensitivity of CT-to-material mapping of contrast were derived from the multiple calculations. American Association of Physicists in Medicine Task Group 43 (TG-43) guidelines and the GBBS were compared for the following clinical dosimetric parameters: Manchester points A and B, International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) report 38 rectal and bladder points, three and nine o'clock, and (D2cm3) to the bladder, rectum, and sigmoid. Points A and B, D(2) cm(3) bladder, ICRU bladder, and three and nine o'clock were within 5% of TG-43 for all GBBS calculations. The source and boundary and applicator account for most of the differences between the GBBS and TG-43 guidelines. The D(2cm3) rectum (n = 3), D(2cm3) sigmoid (n = 1), and ICRU rectum (n = 6) had differences of >5% from TG-43 for the worst case incorrect mapping of contrast to bone. Clinical dosimetric parameters were within 5% of TG-43 when rectal and balloon contrast were mapped to bone and radiopaque packing was not overridden. The GBBS has minimal impact on clinical parameters for this cohort of patients with unshielded applicators. The incorrect mapping of rectal and balloon contrast does not have a significant impact on clinical parameters.

Neoadjuvant treatment response as an early response indicator for patients with rectal cancer.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2012-04-09,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer is associated with improved local control and may result in complete tumor response. Associations between tumor response and disease control following radical resection should be established before tumor response is used to evaluate treatment strategies. The purpose of this study was to assess and compare oncologic outcomes associated with the degree of pathologic response after chemoradiotherapy. All patients with locally advanced (cT3-4 or cN+ by endorectal ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging) rectal carcinoma diagnosed from 1993 to 2008 at our institution and treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy and radical resection were identified, and their records were retrospectively reviewed. The median radiation dose was 50.4 Gy with concurrent chemotherapy. Recurrence-free survival (RFS), distant metastasis (DM), and local recurrence (LR) rates were compared among patients with complete (ypT0N0), intermediate (ypT1-2N0), or poor (ypT3-4 or N+) response by using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression. In all, 725 patients were classified by tumor response: complete (131; 18.1%), intermediate (210; 29.0%), and poor (384; 53.0%). Age, sex, cN stage, and tumor location were not related to tumor response. Tumor response (complete v intermediate v poor) was associated with 5-year RFS (90.5% v 78.7% v 58.5%; P < .001), 5-year DM rates (7.0% v 10.1% v 26.5%; P < .001), and 5-year LR only rates (0% v 1.4% v 4.4%; P = .002).

Patient-reported quality of life during radiation treatment for localized prostate cancer: results from a prospective phase II trial.,BJU international,BJU Int.,2012-04-13,"Study Type--Therapy (cohort) Level of Evidence 2a. What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Patient-reported quality of life (QoL) in prostate cancer is recognized as an important outcome, and has been shown in multiple studies to capture the incidence and timing of patient symptoms more accurately than physician-graded toxicity reports. Although the long-term QoL after completing radiation therapy (RT) has been previously studied, patient experience during RT is not well described in the literature. The present study collected patient-reported QoL during RT in a prospective phase II clinical trial. The study describes in detail the time course and severity of gastrointestinal and genitourinary symptoms during radiation, providing clinically useful information for patients and physicians considering RT during the treatment decision-making process. • To evaluate data collected from a phase II trial to describe the time course and trajectory of patient-reported acute urinary and bowel symptom development during radiation therapy (RT) for prostate cancer. • In all, 100 patients with intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer received 72 Gy of RT to the prostate and seminal vesicles, with 6 months of concurrent androgen deprivation therapy; a rectal balloon was used for prostate immobilization. • Patients completed the validated Prostate Cancer Symptom Indices questionnaire every 1-2 weeks, reporting urinary and bowel symptoms on a four- or five-point Likert scale. • A score of ≥ 3 in a symptom is associated with clinically meaningful distress. Cumulative incidence of each symptom is reported.

Two US nationwide prospective cohort studies. Patients with rectal and colon cancer (N=918). The negative and total node counts (continuous). Specimen length, tumor size, ascending colon location, T3N0M0 stage, and year of diagnosis were positively associated with the negative node count (all P.002). Mutation of KRAS might also be positively associated with the negative node count (P=.03; borderline significance considering multiple hypothesis testing). Among node-negative (stages I and II) cases, specimen length, tumor size, and ascending colon location remained significantly associated with the node count (all P.002), and PIK3CA and KRAS mutations might also be positively associated (P=.03 and P=.049, respectively, with borderline significance).

Postmenopausal hormone therapy is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer lacking CDKN1A expression.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2012-04-17,"Experimental studies have shown that estrogen- or progesterone-activated signaling leads to growth inhibition effects on colon cancer cells through the upregulation of several cell-cycle regulators. However, epidemiologic studies evaluating hormone therapy use and colorectal cancer risk by the status of cell-cycle regulators are lacking. In this study, we used data from the prospective Nurses' Health Study to evaluate whether the association between hormone therapy use and colorectal cancer risk differs by the molecular pathologic status of microsatellite instability (MSI) and expression of cell-cycle-related tumor biomarkers, including CDKN1A (p21, CIP1), CDKN1B (p27, KIP1), and TP53 (p53) by immunohistochemistry. Duplication Cox regression analysis was used to determine an association between hormone therapy use, cancer risk, and specific tumor biomarkers in 581 incident colon and rectal cancer cases that occurred during 26 years of follow-up among 105,520 postmenopausal women. We found a difference between hormone therapy use and colorectal cancer risk according to CDKN1A expression (P(heterogeneity) = 0.01). Current hormone therapy use was associated with a reduced risk for CDKN1A-nonexpressed [multivariate relative risk (RR), 0.61; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.46-0.82] but not for CDKN1A-expressed (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.76-2.31) tumors. The lower risk for CDKN1A-nonexpressed but not for CDKN1A-expressed cancers was also present among current users of estrogen-alone therapy. We found no significant difference in the relations between hormone therapy use and cancer risk according to MSI, CDKN1B, or TP53 status.

Patterns of failure in patients with early onset (synchronous) resectable liver metastases from rectal cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2012-04-19,"The optimal combination of available therapies for patients with resectable synchronous liver metastases from rectal cancer (SLMRC) is unknown, and the pattern of recurrence after resection has been poorly investigated. In this study, the authors examined recurrence patterns and survival after resection of SLMRC. Consecutive patients with SLMRC (disease-free interval, ≤12 months) who underwent complete resection of the rectal primary and liver metastases between 1990 and 2008 were identified from a prospective database. Demographics, tumor-related variables, and treatment-related variables were correlated with recurrence patterns. Competing risk analysis was used to determine the risk of pelvic and extrapelvic recurrence. In total, 185 patients underwent complete resection of rectal primary and liver metastases. One hundred eighty patients (97%) received chemotherapy during their treatment course, and 91 patients (49%) received pelvic radiation therapy either before (N = 65; 71.4%), or after (N = 26; 28.6%) rectal resection. The 5-year disease-specific survival rate was 51% for the entire cohort with a median follow-up of 44 months for survivors. One hundred thirty patients (70%) developed a recurrence: Eighteen patients (10%) had recurrences in the pelvis in combination with other sites, and 7 of these (4%) had an isolated pelvic recurrence. Recurrence pattern did not correlate with survival.

High-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer in a previously radiated patient with polyethylene glycol hydrogel spacing to reduce rectal dose: case report and review of the literature.,Brachytherapy,Brachytherapy,2012-04-28,"To describe the use of a temporary spacer to reduce rectal dose prior to prostate radiation in a man with prior pelvic radiotherapy and review the relevant literature. A healthy 57-year-old man presented with high-risk prostate cancer (Gleason score of 8, prostate-specific antigen level [PSA] 12.6 ng/mL, T3a by magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), only 2.5 years after a low anterior resection followed by pelvic chemo-radiotherapy to 50.4 Gy for a locally advanced rectal cancer. Due to the prior radiation, he was not felt to be a candidate for surgery or external beam radiation, so he chose long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) plus high-dose-rate brachytherapy to 36 Gy in 6 fractions. To reduce the radiation dose to the anterior rectal wall, 10 mL of a polyethylene glycol hydrogel spacer was injected between the prostate and rectum and created between 1.4 and 1.5 cm of separation along the length of the prostate. Two randomized trials demonstrating that local therapy plus ADT improves overall survival compared to ADT alone provided the rationale for additional prostate radiotherapy in this otherwise healthy patient. Salvage brachytherapy is associated with a 3.4% rate of rectal fistula among the 251 cases reported in the literature from 2000-2007, with rates as high as 12% in one series. The spacer allowed the rectal dose constraint goals to be easily met. Injecting an absorbable polyethylene glycol hydrogel to separate the prostate and rectum appears to be associated with decreased maximum and mean rectal doses, and may have particular utility in previously irradiated patients.",Case Reports,2824.0,17.0,To describe the use of a temporary spacer to reduce dose prior to radiation in a man with prior pelvic radiotherapy and review the relevant literature A healthy 57-year-old man presented with high-risk cancer Gleason score of 8 prostate-specific antigen level PSA 12.6 ng/mL T3a by magnetic resonance imaging MRI only 2.5 years after a low anterior resection followed by pelvic chemo-radiotherapy to 50.4 Gy for a locally advanced cancer Due to the prior radiation he was not felt to be a candidate for surgery or external beam radiation so he chose long-term androgen deprivation therapy ADT plus high-dose-rate brachytherapy to 36 Gy in 6 fractions To reduce the radiation dose to the anterior wall 10 mL of a polyethylene glycol hydrogel spacer was injected between the and rectum and created between 1.4 and 1.5 cm of separation along the length of the Two randomized trials demonstrating that local therapy plus ADT improves overall survival compared to ADT alone provided the rationale for additional radiotherapy in this otherwise healthy patient Salvage brachytherapy is associated with a 3.4 rate of fistula among the 251 cases reported in the literature from 2000-2007 with rates as high as 12 in one series The spacer allowed the dose constraint goals to be easily met Injecting an absorbable polyethylene glycol hydrogel to separate the and rectum appears to be associated with decreased maximum and mean doses and may have particular utility in previously irradiated patients,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[6, 897, 3, 119, 1, 8, 7579, 20654, 6, 969, 61, 324, 6, 121, 4, 8, 3628, 5, 324, 1110, 310, 2, 206, 3, 867, 789, 8, 1331, 696, 111, 1095, 3628, 917, 5, 64, 43, 12, 1406, 368, 1, 66, 1364, 112, 448, 301, 534, 133, 49, 997, 542, 12844, 20, 1484, 1535, 270, 704, 158, 18, 33, 60, 50, 8, 154, 2882, 170, 370, 20, 1110, 3341, 310, 6, 212, 39, 381, 9, 8, 795, 131, 12, 520, 6, 3, 324, 121, 3174, 10, 44, 5284, 6, 40, 8, 1609, 9, 152, 15, 1455, 1345, 121, 1743, 3174, 6177, 319, 337, 687, 1868, 36, 1360, 349, 64, 61, 116, 1536, 6, 511, 381, 4, 49, 1550, 6, 969, 3, 121, 61, 6, 3, 2882, 2397, 79, 542, 1, 8, 12997, 10809, 20589, 20654, 10, 2651, 59, 3, 2, 3660, 2, 2466, 59, 14, 39, 2, 14, 33, 494, 1, 5422, 1510, 3, 1318, 1, 3, 100, 384, 143, 2219, 17, 293, 36, 349, 1360, 1804, 63, 25, 72, 6, 1360, 279, 1052, 3, 1728, 9, 402, 310, 4, 26, 2632, 1331, 69, 992, 1536, 16, 41, 5, 8, 27, 39, 116, 1, 4920, 107, 3, 7288, 140, 210, 4, 3, 789, 29, 1081, 1307, 5, 151, 22, 64, 22, 133, 4, 104, 988, 3, 20654, 2313, 3, 61, 11482, 2802, 6, 40, 4697, 543, 17121, 35, 38035, 12997, 10809, 20589, 6, 2282, 3, 2, 3660, 1233, 6, 40, 41, 5, 340, 689, 2, 313, 415, 2, 68, 47, 1454, 1207, 4, 373, 2398, 7]",1488.0,22543116,73
Anastomotic leak is not associated with oncologic outcome in patients undergoing low anterior resection for rectal cancer.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2012-12-01,"To examine the association between anastomotic leak and oncologic outcome after anterior resection, stratifying for defunctioning stoma. It has been hypothesized that anastomotic leak predisposes rectal cancer patients to local recurrence. Many have a defunctioning stoma to reduce risk of clinically significant leakage. The records of patients undergoing low anterior resection (1991-2010) for rectal adenocarcinoma (≤15 cm from anal verge) were retrospectively analyzed using a prospectively collected colorectal database. Data (age, gender, stage, defunctioning stoma, neoadjuvant treatment, distance from anal verge, anastomotic leak) were collected. Clinical leakage was defined as anastomotic complication requiring intervention or interventional radiology within 60 days of surgery. Estimated local recurrence, overall survival, and disease-specific survival were compared using log-rank method and Cox regression analysis. 1127 patients were included, with 5.6-year median follow-up. The incidence of clinical anastomotic leak was 3.5%. Sixteen of 677 with defunctioning stoma (2.2%) developed clinical leak; 24 of 450 without stoma (6.3%) developed leak (P = 0.005). There were no perioperative deaths among patients with clinical leakage. When stratified for defunctioning stoma, there was no association between clinical leak and local recurrence, disease-free survival, or overall survival. On multivariable analysis, when controlling for neoadjuvant therapy, distance of tumor from anal verge, defunctioning stoma, and pathologic stage, clinical leak was not associated with time to local recurrence, disease-free survival, or overall survival. In this cohort, anastomotic leakage was not associated with risk of local recurrence. Defunctioning stoma was associated with lower incidence of clinical leakage but not with difference in oncologic outcome.

Orthovoltage intraoperative radiotherapy for locally advanced and recurrent colorectal cancer.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2012-06-01,"Locally advanced and recurrent colorectal cancers pose a significant therapeutic challenge. Orthovoltage intraoperative radiotherapy provides one potential means of improving disease control at the time of surgery. This study sought to analyze outcomes and identify prognostic factors of patients treated with orthovoltage intraoperative radiotherapy for locally advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer. This study is a retrospective chart review conducted at a tertiary medical center. Between January 1990 and July 2009, 55 patients underwent intraoperative radiotherapy to a total of 61 sites for locally advanced (n = 14) or recurrent (n = 41) cancers of colon (n = 18) or rectum/rectosigmoid junction (n = 37). Median dose was 12 Gy (range, 7.5-20 Gy). Among locally advanced rectal/rectosigmoid cases, surgery included abdominoperineal resection (n = 3) or low anterior resection (n = 9). Seven treated sites had gross residual (R2) disease, 28 had pathologic or clinical microscopic residual disease (R1), and 15 were complete resections (R0). Treated sites included sacrum (n = 22), anterior pelvis/pelvic sidewall (19), sacrum and sidewall (n = 1), aortic bifurcation (n = 2), vaginal cuff (n = 2), psoas (n = 3), perivesicular region (n = 2), and other (n = 10). Outcomes measures included in-field local control, locoregional control, overall survival, and grade ≥3 toxicity. At a median follow-up of 27 months (range, 4-237) among living patients, 2-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of in-field local control, locoregional control, and overall survival were 69%, 51%, and 59%. Margin status predicted for improved locoregional control (p = 0.01) and overall survival (p = 0.01).

Pretreatment characteristics, organ-at-risk dose volume histograms, and maximum GU and GI toxicities (CTCAE 3.0) were evaluated. Logistic regression models evaluated univariate association between toxicities and dosimetric parameters, and uni- and multivariate association between toxicities and pretreatment characteristics. Mean age was 68 (range 51-88). Thirty-two, 49, and 19 patients were low, intermediate, and high-risk, respectively; 40 received concurrent androgen deprivation.

Pulmonary recurrence predominates after combined modality therapy for rectal cancer: an original retrospective study.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2012-07-01,"To characterize patterns of recurrence in locally advanced rectal cancer treated with combined modality therapy (CMT): neoadjuvant chemoradiation + total mesorectal excision + adjuvant chemotherapy. A total of 593 consecutive rectal cancer patients (1998 to 2007) with locally advanced (stage II/III) disease (noted on endorectal ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging) who received CMT were analyzed for patterns of recurrence. After median 44-month follow-up (interquartile range, 25 to 64 months), 119 patients (20%) recurred: 105 distant, 7 local, 7 local and distant, and 112 distant-only recurrence. Ninety-three (78%) had single-organ recurrence, and 26 (22%) had multiple-organ recurrence. The most common site of distant recurrence was lung (69% of all patients with distant relapse); 20% had liver recurrence. Fourteen patients (2.4%) recurred locally. Pulmonary metastases were most commonly identified by computed tomographic scan versus abnormal positron emission tomographic (PET) scan or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Risk factors associated with pulmonary recurrence were the following: pathologic stage, tumor distance from anal verge, lymphovascular or perineural invasion. Five-year freedom from pulmonary recurrence for patients with 0, 1, 2, or 3 risk factors was 99%, 90%, 61%, and 42%, respectively. Thirty of 59 patents with pulmonary recurrence underwent lung metastasectomy; 3-year freedom from recurrence was 37%. Unlike colon cancer, which most frequently recurs in the liver, locally advanced rectal cancer treated with CMT relapses most frequently in the lung. Pulmonary metastasis was associated with advanced pathologic stage, low-lying tumor, lymphovascular invasion, or perineural invasion. Confirmation of pulmonary metastasis usually requires serial imaging because metastases are often small when initially detected, well below the resolution of PET, and not necessarily associated with elevated CEA.

A comparative study on endoscopy treatment in rectal carcinoid tumors.,"Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",Surg Laparosc Endosc Percutan Tech,2012-06-01,"To investigate the advantages and disadvantages of various endoscopic resection methods for rectal carcinoid tumors. A retrospective analysis of 3 types of endoscopic resection techniques for rectal carcinoid tumors was performed. The surgical time and the complication rate were compared between 30 patients who underwent conventional endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), cap-assisted endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR-C), or endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). All rectal carcinoid tumors were under 1 cm and were treated in our center between January 2002 and January 2008. Ten patients underwent each surgical approach. All cases were pathologically diagnosed as rectal carcinoid tumors. One-time complete resection rates using the conventional EMR, EMR-C, and ESD were 80%, 100%, and 100%, respectively.

"Specific mutations in KRAS codons 12 and 13, and patient prognosis in 1075 BRAF wild-type colorectal cancers.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2012-07-02,"To assess prognostic roles of various KRAS oncogene mutations in colorectal cancer, BRAF mutation status must be controlled for because BRAF mutation is associated with poor prognosis, and almost all BRAF mutants are present among KRAS wild-type tumors. Taking into account experimental data supporting a greater oncogenic effect of codon 12 mutations compared with codon 13 mutations, we hypothesized that KRAS codon 12-mutated colorectal cancers might behave more aggressively than KRAS wild-type tumors and codon 13 mutants. Using molecular pathological epidemiology database of 1,261 rectal and colon cancers, we examined clinical outcome and tumor biomarkers of KRAS codon 12 and 13 mutations in 1,075 BRAF wild-type cancers (i.e., controlling for BRAF status). Cox proportional hazards model was used to compute mortality HR, adjusting for potential confounders, including stage, PIK3CA mutations, microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, and LINE-1 methylation. Compared with patients with KRAS wild-type/BRAF wild-type cancers (N = 635), those with KRAS codon 12 mutations (N = 332) experienced significantly higher colorectal cancer-specific mortality [log-rank P = 0.0001; multivariate HR, 1.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.67; P = 0.037], whereas KRAS codon 13-mutated cases (N = 108) were not significantly associated with prognosis. Among the seven most common KRAS mutations, c.35G>T (p.G12V; N = 93) was associated with significantly higher colorectal cancer-specific mortality (log-rank P = 0.0007; multivariate HR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.38-2.90, P = 0.0003) compared with KRAS wild-type/BRAF wild-type cases.

Whole-mount pathologic analysis of rectal cancer following neoadjuvant therapy: implications of margin status on long-term oncologic outcome.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2012-08-01,"Extent of distal resection margins in rectal cancer surgery remains controversial. We set out to determine the long-term oncologic impact of resection margins in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer using a comprehensive pathologic whole-mount section analysis. It has been demonstrated that there is minimal disease beyond the gross tumor margin after neoadjuvant combined modality therapy (CMT) for rectal cancer. Although this suggests that close resection margins may be used for sphincter preservation, the long-term oncologic impact of this approach is unclear. We prospectively enrolled 103 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant CMT. Whole-mount pathologic analysis was performed, and clinicopathologic variables were correlated with disease-specific survival (DSS). : Sphincter preservation was achieved in 80% of patients, and the median distal margin was 2 cm (0.1 to 10 cm). There were 22 patients (21%) with distal margins 1 cm or less and no patient had a positive distal margin. Median radial margin was 1 cm and 4 patients (4%) had a margin of 1 mm or less. Viable distal intramural tumor spread was found in 3 patients (2.7%) and in all cases was limited to 1 cm or less from the gross tumor edge. At a median follow-up of 68 months, 5-year DSS was 86% and 1 patient experienced a local recurrence. Factors predictive of worse DSS included advanced tumor (T) and nodal (N) stage, tumor progression on neoadjuvant CMT, lack of a complete pathologic response, tumor location of 5 cm or less from the anal verge, and neurovascular invasion. The extent of the distal and radial margins of resection was not associated with DSS. These results suggest that carefully selected patients with locally advanced rectal cancers who undergo neoadjuvant CMT can achieve excellent local control and DSS with a sphincter-sparing rectal resection and a margin distal clearance of 1 cm.",Journal Article,2729.0,26.0,Extent of distal resection margins in cancer surgery remains controversial We set out to determine the long-term oncologic impact of resection margins in patients with locally advanced cancer using a comprehensive pathologic whole-mount section analysis It has been demonstrated that there is minimal disease beyond the gross tumor margin after neoadjuvant combined modality therapy CMT for cancer Although this suggests that close resection margins may be used for sphincter preservation the long-term oncologic impact of this approach is unclear We prospectively enrolled 103 patients with locally advanced cancer after neoadjuvant CMT Whole-mount pathologic analysis was performed and clinicopathologic variables were correlated with disease-specific survival DSS Sphincter preservation was achieved in 80 of patients and the median distal margin was 2 cm 0.1 to 10 cm There were 22 patients 21 with distal margins 1 cm or less and no patient had a positive distal margin Median radial margin was 1 cm and 4 patients 4 had a margin of 1 mm or less Viable distal intramural tumor spread was found in 3 patients 2.7 and in all cases was limited to 1 cm or less from the gross tumor edge At a median follow-up of 68 months 5-year DSS was 86 and 1 patient experienced a local recurrence Factors predictive of worse DSS included advanced tumor T and nodal N stage tumor progression on neoadjuvant CMT lack of a complete pathologic response tumor location of 5 cm or less from the verge and neurovascular invasion The extent of the distal and radial margins of resection was not associated with DSS These results suggest that carefully selected patients with locally advanced cancers who undergo neoadjuvant CMT can achieve excellent local control and DSS with a sphincter-sparing resection and a margin distal clearance of 1 cm,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[1039, 1, 2107, 170, 1012, 4, 12, 152, 469, 2010, 21, 916, 1205, 6, 223, 3, 319, 337, 1998, 345, 1, 170, 1012, 4, 7, 5, 795, 131, 12, 75, 8, 949, 510, 902, 9652, 2917, 65, 192, 71, 85, 264, 17, 125, 16, 1048, 34, 1654, 3, 1789, 30, 959, 50, 536, 397, 1396, 36, 5380, 9, 12, 242, 26, 844, 17, 2336, 170, 1012, 68, 40, 95, 9, 5400, 2224, 3, 319, 337, 1998, 345, 1, 26, 353, 16, 1200, 21, 1143, 346, 3283, 7, 5, 795, 131, 12, 50, 536, 5380, 902, 9652, 510, 65, 10, 173, 2, 1399, 682, 11, 438, 5, 34, 112, 25, 1788, 5400, 2224, 10, 513, 4, 493, 1, 7, 2, 3, 52, 2107, 959, 10, 18, 494, 13, 14, 6, 79, 494, 125, 11, 350, 7, 239, 5, 2107, 1012, 14, 494, 15, 299, 2, 77, 69, 42, 8, 109, 2107, 959, 52, 6471, 959, 10, 14, 494, 2, 39, 7, 39, 42, 8, 959, 1, 14, 321, 15, 299, 2663, 2107, 22056, 30, 2579, 10, 204, 4, 27, 7, 18, 67, 2, 4, 62, 140, 10, 383, 6, 14, 494, 15, 299, 29, 3, 1789, 30, 7951, 28, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 806, 53, 33, 111, 1788, 10, 868, 2, 14, 69, 592, 8, 293, 146, 130, 464, 1, 639, 1788, 159, 131, 30, 102, 2, 779, 78, 82, 30, 91, 23, 536, 5380, 926, 1, 8, 236, 510, 51, 30, 1147, 1, 33, 494, 15, 299, 29, 3, 8330, 2, 9848, 578, 3, 1039, 1, 3, 2107, 2, 6471, 1012, 1, 170, 10, 44, 41, 5, 1788, 46, 99, 309, 17, 3900, 715, 7, 5, 795, 131, 163, 54, 1251, 536, 5380, 122, 1359, 1503, 293, 182, 2, 1788, 5, 8, 5400, 1851, 170, 2, 8, 959, 2107, 1960, 1, 14, 494]",1825.0,22791103,309

The primary endpoint was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), defined as the dose that causes 25% dose-limiting toxicity (DLT, grade ≥II). Assignment to dose level was based upon an adaptive design, the continual reassessment method. A mammogram and random core biopsy of the contralateral breast were obtained at baseline and 6 months and serial blood/urine collections every 2 months for biomarker analyses. Forty women were randomized: 10 to placebo, 30 to Poly E (16 at 400 mg, 11 at 600 mg, 3 at 800 mg). There was one DLT at 400 mg (grade III rectal bleeding), three DLTs at 600 mg (grade II weight gain, grade III indigestion and insomnia), and one DLT at 800 mg (grade III liver function abnormality). The DLT rate at 600 mg was 27% (3 of 11). Pharmacologic levels of total urinary tea polyphenols were achieved with all three dose levels of Poly E.

Insulin-like growth factor 2 messenger RNA binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) is a marker of unfavourable prognosis in colorectal cancer.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",Eur. J. Cancer,2012-07-26,"Evidence suggests that insulin-like growth factor 2 messenger RNA binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3, also known as IMP3) represents a promising cancer biomarker. However, the clinical, pathological, molecular and prognostic features of IGF2BP3-positive colorectal cancers remain uncertain. We evaluated IGF2BP3 expression by immunohistochemistry in 671 rectal and colon cancer cases that form part of a molecular pathological epidemiology database. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to compute mortality hazard ratio (HR), adjusting for clinical, pathological and molecular features, including microsatellite instability, the CpG island methylator phenotype, LINE-1 methylation and KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations. Among 671 colorectal cancers, 234 (35%) tumours were positive for IGF2BP3. In contrast, normal colorectal epithelium was negative for IGF2BP3 in all 403 specimens of normal mucosa adjacent to carcinoma. IGF2BP3 positivity was associated with poor differentiation (p=0.0003), stage III-IV disease (p=0.0081), BRAF mutation (p=0.031), and LINE-1 hypomethylation (p=0.020). IGF2BP3 positivity was significantly associated with shorter colorectal cancer-specific [log-rank p<0.0001; multivariate HR, 1.37; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.84] and overall survival (log-rank p=0.0004; multivariate HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.05-1.66).

Recent studies in other cancers have reported that hypoxia influences response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation. This study aimed to 1) characterize hypoxia-related protein expression in locally advanced rectal cancer before neoadjuvant chemoradiation, 2) determine the comodulation of hypoxia-related protein expression, and 3) evaluate the relationship between hypoxia-related protein expression and overall survival, time to recurrence, and tumor regression grade. Immunohistochemical analysis of 4 hypoxia-related proteins (HIF-1α, CA-IX, VEGF, and GLUT-1) was performed on archival pretreatment rectal cancer biopsies. : Eighty-five patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant radiation and 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy were included. The impact of hypoxia-related protein expression on outcome was evaluated by use of Cox proportional hazards model. Hypoxia-related protein expression was correlated with tumor regression grade by use of Spearman correlation coefficients. Median follow-up was 54 months. CA-IX expression was associated with overall survival (p = 0.01). HIF-1α expression was weakly correlated with VEGF (r = 0.26, p = 0.02) and GLUT-1 (r = 0.35, p = 0.001). Hypoxia-related protein expression was not associated with time to recurrence or Mandard tumor regression grade. Elevated CA-IX expression may be associated with poorer overall survival in locally advanced rectal cancer treated by neoadjuvant chemoradiation and resection.

Sixteen patients were treated with unresectable, recurrent abdomino-pelvic colorectal carcinoma: 11 in pelvis; 4 with isolated aortic/retroperitoneal disease; and 1 with pelvic and peri-adrenal/retroperitoneal disease. Eleven patients had recurrent rectal cancer and five had recurrent colon cancer. Median overall and 3-year actuarial survivals were 15 months and 24%, respectively.

Optimizing adjuvant treatment decisions for stage t2 rectal cancer based on mesorectal node size: a decision analysis.,Academic radiology,Acad Radiol,2012-09-02,"The aim of this study was to optimize treatment decisions for patients with suspected stage T2 rectal cancer on the basis of mesorectal lymph node size at magnetic resonance imaging. A decision-analytic model was developed to predict outcomes for patients with stage T2 rectal cancer at magnetic resonance imaging. Node-positive patients were assumed to benefit from chemoradiation prior to surgery. Imperfect magnetic resonance imaging performance for primary cancer and mesorectal nodal staging was incorporated. Five triage strategies were considered for administering preoperative chemoradiation: treat all patients; treat for any mesorectal node >3, >5, and >7 mm in size; and treat no patients. If nodal metastases or unsuspected stage T3 disease went untreated preoperatively, postoperative chemoradiation was needed, resulting in poorer outcomes. For each strategy, rates of acute and long-term chemoradiation toxicity and of 5-year local recurrence were computed. Effects of input parameter uncertainty were evaluated in sensitivity analysis. The optimal strategy depended on the outcome prioritized. Acute and long-term chemoradiation toxicity rates were minimized by triaging only patients with nodes >7 mm to preoperative chemoradiation (18.9% and 10.8%, respectively). A treat-all strategy minimized the 5-year local recurrence rate (5.6%). A 7-mm nodal triage threshold increased the 5-year local recurrence rate to 8.0%; when no patients were treated preoperatively, the local recurrence rate was 10.1%.

"The antioxidant, MnTE-2-PyP, prevents side-effects incurred by prostate cancer irradiation.",PloS one,PLoS ONE,2012-09-12,"Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 240,000 new cases reported annually in the United States. Due to early detection and advances in therapies, more than 90% of patients will survive 10 years post diagnosis and treatment. Radiation is a treatment option often used to treat localized disease; however, while radiation is very effective at killing tumor cells, normal tissues are damaged as well. Potential side-effects due to prostate cancer-related radiation therapy include bowel inflammation, erectile dysfunction, urethral stricture, rectal bleeding and incontinence. Currently, radiation therapy for prostate cancer does not include the administration of therapeutic agents to reduce these side effects and protect normal tissues from radiation-induced damage. In the current study, we show that the small molecular weight antioxidant, MnTE-2-PyP, protects normal tissues from radiation-induced damage in the lower abdomen in rats. Specifically, MnTE-2-PyP protected skin, prostate, and testes from radiation-induced damage. MnTE-2-PyP also protected from erectile dysfunction, a persistent problem regardless of the type of radiation techniques used because the penile neurovascular bundles lay in the peripheral zones of the prostate, where most prostate cancers reside. Based on previous studies showing that MnTE-2-PyP, in combination with radiation, further reduces subcutaneous tumor growth, we believe that MnTE-2-PyP represents an excellent radioprotectant in combination radiotherapy for cancer in general and specifically for prostate cancer.",Journal Article,2687.0,24.0,"cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer with an estimated 240,000 new cases reported annually in the United States Due to early detection and advances in therapies more than 90 of patients will survive 10 years post diagnosis and treatment Radiation is a treatment option often used to treat localized disease however while radiation is very effective at killing tumor cells normal tissues are damaged as well Potential side-effects due to cancer-related radiation therapy include bowel inflammation erectile dysfunction stricture bleeding and incontinence Currently radiation therapy for cancer does not include the administration of therapeutic agents to reduce these side effects and protect normal tissues from radiation-induced damage In the current study we show that the small molecular weight antioxidant MnTE-2-PyP protects normal tissues from radiation-induced damage in the lower abdomen in rats Specifically MnTE-2-PyP protected and testes from radiation-induced damage MnTE-2-PyP also protected from erectile dysfunction a persistent problem regardless of the type of radiation techniques used because the neurovascular bundles lay in the peripheral zones of the where most cancers reside Based on previous studies showing that MnTE-2-PyP in combination with radiation further reduces subcutaneous tumor growth we believe that MnTE-2-PyP represents an excellent radioprotectant in combination radiotherapy for cancer in general and specifically for cancer",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[12, 16, 3, 96, 841, 265, 12, 5, 35, 661, 4263, 984, 217, 140, 210, 4226, 4, 3, 1088, 907, 520, 6, 191, 638, 2, 954, 4, 235, 80, 76, 424, 1, 7, 303, 4573, 79, 60, 539, 147, 2, 24, 121, 16, 8, 24, 1501, 629, 95, 6, 943, 909, 34, 137, 369, 121, 16, 923, 323, 28, 3003, 30, 37, 295, 742, 32, 9884, 22, 149, 174, 1152, 176, 520, 6, 12, 139, 121, 36, 643, 1659, 1815, 5186, 1527, 6673, 2294, 2, 6152, 694, 121, 36, 9, 12, 1097, 44, 643, 3, 634, 1, 189, 183, 6, 969, 46, 1152, 176, 2, 4869, 295, 742, 29, 121, 277, 1350, 4, 3, 291, 45, 21, 514, 17, 3, 302, 219, 924, 5536, 32022, 18, 32023, 8170, 295, 742, 29, 121, 277, 1350, 4, 3, 280, 4036, 4, 3765, 1225, 32022, 18, 32023, 5541, 2, 13100, 29, 121, 277, 1350, 32022, 18, 32023, 120, 5541, 29, 5186, 1527, 8, 1882, 2497, 1583, 1, 3, 267, 1, 121, 1092, 95, 408, 3, 9848, 16206, 9455, 4, 3, 672, 13814, 1, 3, 1257, 96, 163, 10114, 90, 23, 698, 94, 2069, 17, 32022, 18, 32023, 4, 150, 5, 121, 195, 2389, 2529, 30, 129, 21, 4629, 17, 32022, 18, 32023, 1449, 35, 1503, 47400, 4, 150, 310, 9, 12, 4, 1083, 2, 1225, 9, 12]",1473.0,22984473,542

We conducted a pooled analysis of eight studies, including 6,796 CRC cases and 7,770 controls, to evaluate the association between cigarette smoking history and CRC risk and to investigate potential effect modification by other risk factors. Current smokers [OR, 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.11-1.43] and former smokers (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.09-1.27), relative to never smokers, showed higher risks of CRC. Former smokers remained at higher CRC risk, relative to never smokers, for up to about 25 years after quitting. The impact of time since quitting varied by cancer subsite: The excess risk due to smoking decreased immediately after quitting for proximal colon and rectal cancer but not until about 20 years post-quitting for distal colon cancer. Furthermore, we observed borderline statistically significant additive interactions between smoking status and body mass index [BMI; relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI]), 0.15; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.31; P = 0.06] and significant additive interaction between smoking status and fruit consumption (RERI, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.01-0.30; P = 0.04).

ACR appropriateness criteria®  resectable rectal cancer.,"Radiation oncology (London, England)",Radiat Oncol,2012-09-24,"The management of resectable rectal cancer continues to be guided by clinical trials and advances in technique. Although surgical advances including total mesorectal excision continue to decrease rates of local recurrence, the management of locally advanced disease (T3-T4 or N+) benefits from a multimodality approach including neoadjuvant concomitant chemotherapy and radiation. Circumferential resection margin, which can be determined preoperatively via MRI, is prognostic. Toxicity associated with radiation therapy is decreased by placing the patient in the prone position on a belly board, however for patients who cannot tolerate prone positioning, IMRT decreases the volume of normal tissue irradiated. The use of IMRT requires knowledge of the patterns of spreads and anatomy. Clinical trials demonstrate high variability in target delineation without specific guidance demonstrating the need for peer review and the use of a consensus atlas. Concomitant with radiation, fluorouracil based chemotherapy remains the standard, and although toxicity is decreased with continuous infusion fluorouracil, oral capecitabine is non-inferior to the continuous infusion regimen. Additional chemotherapeutic agents, including oxaliplatin, continue to be investigated, however currently should only be utilized on clinical trials as increased toxicity and no definitive benefit has been demonstrated in clinical trials. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every two years by a multidisciplinary expert panel.

Meeting the biologic challenge of colorectal metastases.,Clinical & experimental metastasis,Clin. Exp. Metastasis,2012-10-10,"An overview of colorectal cancer discussed (Philip Paty) the good outcome after primary management with local control in 90-95 % of colon and 85 % in rectal cancer patients with major progression to metastases and to death related to hematogenous dissemination. The major disease pathways include the APC, aneuploid pathway involving mutations of P53, KRAS, SMAD 4, or the CMP/MSI pathway, mismatched repair defect as characterized by Lynch syndrome, the major hereditary form which may also have KRAS and P53 mutations. The common sporadic colorectal cancers are MS1 high, with many patients having BRAF and KRAS mutations. The sentinel node biopsy in colorectal cancer surgery may provide more definitive staging and perhaps modification of the extent of resection with better outcome as suggested by Dr. Saha. The identification of sentinel lymph nodes outside of the planned bowel resection may increase the resection biologically indicated by the sentinel lymph node location leading to better outcome. In a small study by Dr. Saha, the operation was enhanced in 21 % by extending the length of bowel resection, which increased node recovery to 18.5 nodes versus 12 nodes with the more conventional resection, increasing nodal recovery, and positivity to 60 % with reduction to five year recurrence rate to 9 % versus 27 % with the conventional resection. A new (Swiss) technique for pathologic node examination, the OSNA (the One Step Nucleic Acid diagnostic system), was presented which demonstrated increased detection of micro-metastases in a focused pathology study of 22 patients (Zuber) to 11 out of 15 patients versus the 7 micro-metastases identified by the standard single slide per node, and compared to 14 out of 15 with an intensive multi-slide technique. This suggests value in pursuing OSNA study by other centers with relevant clinical trials to establish its true value. An analysis of liver resection for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) emphasized the value of 10-year follow-up (DeAngelica). The 10-year survival of 102 patients among 612 patients was 17 % (Memorial Sloan Kettering data). At the five-year point 99 of 102 survivors were NED and 86 have been free of disease since the resection. The usual five-year figure after hepatic resection reveals that one-third of five-year survivors die from recurrence of distant disease suggesting the value of longer term follow-up in these patients. An additional question reviewed related to the role of neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy (with response rates in the 50 % range) to produce down staging of the hepatic metastases and allow one to retrieve these patients with possible residual disease. In a series of 116 patients who had hepatic resection of CRC metastases in presence of regional node metastases, post neoadjuvant chemotherapy (normally not candidates for resection) these patients were demonstrated to have a 95 % recurrence at median time of 9 months. This raises a cautionary note to the literature report of five-year survivals in the 20-30 % range for hepatic metastases in presence of extra hepatic disease. Such may reflect patient selection rather than a true measure of the biology of disease, and warrant clinical trial evaluation. Lastly, regional therapy and overall systemic therapy were addressed by Dr. Kemeny. The CALGB study of hepatic artery infusion (HAI) with FUDR, dexamethasone versus 5FU leucovorin showed an overall survival of 24.4 months with HAI versus 20 months with systemic therapy (P = 0.0034). An adjuvant trial of HAI at MSK in 156 patients showed an overall survival benefit at 2 year and recent long term 10yr follow-up showing a significant overall survival of 41 % with HAI versus 27 % with systemic therapy (5FU leucovorin). In the neoadjuvant Nordlinger trial for hepatic metastases, there was a significant outcome differences-the preoperative therapy group had 9.2 % increase of progression free survival versus the surgery alone group which suggests the value of combining neoadjuvant surgery in good risk liver resection candidates. Conclude the final lesson from this well presented mini symposium confirms the need for continued evaluation of the numerous discussion points by clinical trial.",Journal Article,2659.0,37.0,An overview of cancer discussed Philip Paty the good outcome after primary management with local control in 90-95 of and 85 in cancer patients with major progression to metastases and to death related to

"Aspirin use, tumor PIK3CA mutation, and colorectal-cancer survival.",The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2012-10-01,"Regular use of aspirin after a diagnosis of colon cancer has been associated with a superior clinical outcome. Experimental evidence suggests that inhibition of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) (also known as cyclooxygenase-2) by aspirin down-regulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling activity. We hypothesized that the effect of aspirin on survival and prognosis in patients with cancers characterized by mutated PIK3CA (the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphonate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha polypeptide gene) might differ from the effect among those with wild-type PIK3CA cancers. We obtained data on 964 patients with rectal or colon cancer from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, including data on aspirin use after diagnosis and the presence or absence of PIK3CA mutation. We used a Cox proportional-hazards model to compute the multivariate hazard ratio for death. We examined tumor markers, including PTGS2, phosphorylated AKT, KRAS, BRAF, microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, and methylation of long interspersed nucleotide element 1. Among patients with mutated-PIK3CA colorectal cancers, regular use of aspirin after diagnosis was associated with superior colorectal cancer-specific survival (multivariate hazard ratio for cancer-related death, 0.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06 to 0.61; P<0.001 by the log-rank test) and overall survival (multivariate hazard ratio for death from any cause, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.94; P=0.01 by the log-rank test). In contrast, among patients with wild-type PIK3CA, regular use of aspirin after diagnosis was not associated with colorectal cancer-specific survival (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.32; P=0.76 by the log-rank test; P=0.009 for interaction between aspirin and PIK3CA variables) or overall survival (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.17; P=0.96 by the log-rank test; P=0.07 for interaction). Regular use of aspirin after diagnosis was associated with longer survival among patients with mutated-PIK3CA colorectal cancer, but not among patients with wild-type PIK3CA cancer. The findings from this molecular pathological epidemiology study suggest that the PIK3CA mutation in colorectal cancer may serve as a predictive molecular biomarker for adjuvant aspirin therapy.

Treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer: controversies and questions.,World journal of gastroenterology,World J. Gastroenterol.,2012-10-01,"Rectal cancers extending through the rectal wall, or involving locoregional lymph nodes (T3/4 or N1/2), have been more difficult to cure. The confines of the bony pelvis and the necessity of preserving the autonomic nerves makes surgical extirpation challenging, which accounts for the high rates of local and distant relapse in this setting. Combined multimodality treatment for rectal cancer stage II and III was recommended from National Institute of Health consensus. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation using fluoropyrimidine-based regimen prior to surgical resection has emerged as the standard of care in the United States. Optimal time of surgery after neoadjuvant treatment remained unclear and prospective randomized controlled trial is ongoing. Traditionally, 6-8 wk waiting period was commonly used.

Multimodality salvage of recurrent disease after local excision for rectal cancer.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2012-12-01,"Local excision, alone or in combination with chemoradiation, is increasingly considered for rectal cancer. Higher risks of disease recurrence have been demonstrated after local excision. The aim of this study was to examine the outcomes of current-era multimodality salvage for recurrent rectal cancer after local excision. This was a single-institutional retrospective study. This study was conducted at a tertiary-referral cancer center between 1993 and 2011. Forty-six patients with recurrent rectal cancer after initial local excision were included. Multimodality salvage treatment was performed as appropriate. The primary outcomes measured were the pattern of disease recurrence, salvage treatments, and resultant overall and re-recurrence-free survival. After the initial local excision, recurrent disease was diagnosed after a median interval of 1.9 years: local/regionally in 67%, distantly in 18%, and both in 15%. Four patients (9%) had recurrence that was unsalvageable, 2 (4%) declined treatment, and 40 (87%) underwent surgical salvage. Preoperative chemoradiation was given in 30 (75%) patients. The R0 resection rate was 80%, requiring multivisceral resection (33%), total pelvic exenteration (5%), and metastasectomy (25%). The rate of sphincter preservation was 33%, and perioperative morbidity was 50%. The first site of failure after salvage was distant in 38% and was local only in 10%. The 5-year overall and 3-year re-recurrence-free survival were 63% and 43%. Pathologic stage at initial local excision, receipt of neoadjuvant chemoradiation before local excision, recurrence pattern after local excision, pathologic stage at salvage, and R0 resection at salvage influenced re-recurrence-free survival. This study was limited by the referral and selection biases inherent in a small study cohort. Failure after local excision for rectal cancer may not be salvageable. When feasible, multimodality treatment, including multivisceral resection, pelvic irradiation, and chemotherapy, was associated with potentially lasting treatment-related morbidities and only modest success in long-term disease control. These findings should be compared with the expected stage-specific outcomes of standard proctectomy for early-stage rectal cancer, when local excision is being considered.",Journal Article,2607.0,26.0,Local excision alone or in combination with chemoradiation is increasingly considered for cancer Higher risks of disease recurrence have been demonstrated after local excision The aim of this study was to examine the outcomes of current-era multimodality salvage for recurrent cancer after local excision This was a single-institutional retrospective study This study was conducted at a tertiary-referral cancer center between 1993 and 2011 Forty-six patients with recurrent cancer after initial local excision were included Multimodality salvage treatment was performed as appropriate The primary outcomes measured were the pattern of disease recurrence salvage treatments and resultant overall and re-recurrence-free survival After the initial local excision recurrent disease was diagnosed after a median interval of 1.9 years local/regionally in 67 distantly in 18 and both in 15 Four patients 9 had recurrence that was unsalvageable 2 4 declined treatment and 40 87 underwent surgical salvage Preoperative chemoradiation was given in 30 75 patients The R0 resection rate was 80 requiring multivisceral resection 33 total pelvic exenteration 5 and metastasectomy 25 The rate of sphincter preservation was 33 and perioperative morbidity was 50 The first site of failure after salvage was distant in 38 and was local only in 10 The 5-year overall and 3-year re-recurrence-free survival were 63 and 43 Pathologic stage at initial local excision receipt of neoadjuvant chemoradiation before local excision recurrence pattern after local excision pathologic stage at salvage and R0 resection at salvage influenced re-recurrence-free survival This study was limited by the referral and selection biases inherent in a small study cohort Failure after local excision for cancer may not be salvageable When feasible multimodality treatment including multivisceral resection pelvic irradiation and chemotherapy was associated with potentially lasting treatment-related morbidities and only modest success in long-term disease control These findings should be compared with the expected stage-specific outcomes of standard proctectomy for early-stage cancer when local excision is being considered,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[293, 1366, 279, 15, 4, 150, 5, 975, 16, 1635, 515, 9, 12, 142, 1098, 1, 34, 146, 47, 85, 264, 50, 293, 1366, 3, 1130, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 1004, 3, 123, 1, 291, 1713, 2425, 992, 9, 387, 12, 50, 293, 1366, 26, 10, 8, 226, 1115, 459, 45, 26, 45, 10, 426, 28, 8, 2557, 2096, 12, 574, 59, 3343, 2, 1132, 1213, 437, 7, 5, 387, 12, 50, 388, 293, 1366, 11, 159, 2425, 992, 24, 10, 173, 22, 870, 3, 86, 123, 644, 11, 3, 1177, 1, 34, 146, 992, 640, 2, 6099, 63, 2, 1491, 146, 115, 25, 50, 3, 388, 293, 1366, 387, 34, 10, 265, 50, 8, 52, 268, 1, 14, 83, 60, 293, 8183, 4, 598, 14097, 4, 203, 2, 110, 4, 167, 294, 7, 83, 42, 146, 17, 10, 34472, 18, 39, 3054, 24, 2, 327, 912, 208, 221, 992, 498, 975, 10, 447, 4, 201, 481, 7, 3, 2328, 170, 116, 10, 493, 1888, 16571, 170, 466, 181, 1110, 5668, 33, 2, 4452, 243, 3, 116, 1, 5400, 2224, 10, 466, 2, 1547, 787, 10, 212, 3, 157, 606, 1, 496, 50, 992, 10, 626, 4, 519, 2, 10, 293, 158, 4, 79, 3, 33, 111, 63, 2, 27, 111, 1491, 146, 115, 25, 11, 676, 2, 601, 510, 82, 28, 388, 293, 1366, 1699, 1, 536, 975, 348, 293, 1366, 146, 1177, 50, 293, 1366, 510, 82, 28, 992, 2, 2328, 170, 28, 992, 2574, 1491, 146, 115, 25, 26, 45, 10, 383, 20, 3, 2096, 2, 881, 8232, 4943, 4, 8, 302, 45, 180, 496, 50, 293, 1366, 9, 12, 68, 44, 40, 28123, 198, 1313, 2425, 24, 141, 16571, 170, 1110, 1104, 2, 56, 10, 41, 5, 751, 3443, 24, 139, 5655, 2, 158, 1721, 1825, 4, 319, 337, 34, 182, 46, 272, 257, 40, 72, 5, 3, 1336, 82, 112, 123, 1, 260, 12899, 9, 191, 82, 12, 198, 293, 1366, 16, 486, 515]",2190.0,23135578,42

Nonoperative management of rectal cancer with complete clinical response after neoadjuvant therapy.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2012-12-01,"Nonoperative management (NOM) of rectal cancer after a complete clinical response (cCR) to neoadjuvant therapy is controversial. In this article, we retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of patients managed with selective NOM after a cCR to neoadjuvant treatment and compared these with patients who underwent standard rectal resection with a pathological complete response (pCR). Patients completing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for stage I to III rectal cancer between January 2006 and August 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Median follow-up was calculated in months after completion of CRT. Thirty-two patients (median follow-up 28 months) were treated by NOM after a cCR. Among 265 treated by CRT and rectal resection, 57 patients (22%) had a pCR and formed the control group (median follow-up 43 months). Factors associated with selective use of NOM included lower pretreatment stage, older age, and distal tumor location (P < 0.05). In the NOM group, 6 recurred locally (median 11 months, range 7-14), 3 of whom also had concurrent distant recurrence. All 6 local failures were controlled by salvage rectal resection with no further local recurrence of disease (median follow-up 17 months). In the rectal resection/pCR group, there were no local failures. The 2-year distant disease-free survival (88% vs 98%, P = 0.27) and overall survival (96% vs 100%, P = 0.56) were similar for NOM and rectal resection/pCR groups.

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Colorectal Cancer Database tracks longitudinal care for patients treated at eight specialty cancer centers across the United States and was used to evaluate how frequently patients with rectal cancer who were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy also received postoperative systemic chemotherapy. Patient and tumor characteristics were examined in a multivariable logistic regression model. Between September 2005 and December 2010, 2,073 patients with stage II/III rectal cancer were enrolled in the database. Of these, 1,193 patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy were in the analysis, including 203 patients not receiving any adjuvant chemotherapy. For those seen by a medical oncologist, the most frequent reason chemotherapy was not recommended was comorbid illness (25 of 50, 50%); the most frequent reason chemotherapy was not received even though it was recommended or discussed was patient refusal (54 of 74, 73%). After controlling for NCCN Cancer Center and clinical TNM stage in a multivariable logistic model, factors significantly associated with not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy were age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≥ 1, on Medicaid or indigent compared with private insurance, complete pathologic response, presence of re-operation/wound infection, and no closure of ileostomy/colostomy.

A recent retrospective study suggests familial clustering of CRC with hypomethylation in long interspersed nucleotide element 1 (LINE-1). We tested the hypothesis that CRC family history might confer a higher risk of LINE-1 methylation-low CRC. Using the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, we prospectively examined the association between CRC family history and the risk of rectal and colon cancer (N = 1224) according to tumor LINE-1 methylation level by duplication method Cox proportional hazards regression. We examined microsatellite instability (MSI) status to exclude the influence of Lynch syndrome. All statistical tests were two-sided. The association between CRC family history and non-MSI CRC risk differed statistically significantly by LINE-1 methylation level (P (heterogeneity) = .02). CRC family history was associated with a statistically significantly higher risk of LINE-1 methylation-low non-MSI cancer (multivariable hazard ratio [HR] = 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19 to 2.38 for 1 vs 0 first-degree relatives with CRC; multivariable HR = 3.48, 95% CI = 1.59 to 7.6 for ≥2 vs 0 first-degree relatives with CRC; P (trend) < .001). In contrast, CRC family history was not statistically significantly associated with LINE-1 methylation-high non-MSI cancer (P (trend) = .35). This molecular pathological epidemiology study shows that CRC family history is associated with a higher risk of LINE-1 methylation-low CRC, suggesting previously unrecognized heritable predisposition to epigenetic alterations.

A major obstacle in pursuing nonoperative management in patients with rectal cancer after chemoradiation is the inability to identify a pCR preoperatively. A total of 121 patients with rectal cancer were prospectively enrolled. FDG-PET scans and helical CT scans were obtained before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Consensus readings of PET and CT scans were used to classify certainty of disease (5-point confidence rating scale). The ability of PET and CT scans to accurately distinguish a pCR (ypT0) from an incomplete response (ypT1-4) was estimated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Of the 121 patients, 26 (21%) had a pCR. PET and CT scans were equally inadequate at distinguishing a pCR from an incomplete response (AUC = 0.64 for both, P = 0.97).

This study aims to evaluate the rate and identify factors that affect pathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with early age-of-onset rectal cancer. This study is a retrospective review. The investigation was conducted at a tertiary-care cancer referral center. Included were 193 consecutive patients ≤ 50 years of age with rectal cancer who underwent neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection. No interventions were performed. The primary outcome measured was the pathologic response to neoadjuvant treatment. The median age was 44 years, and 34% of the patients were female. The median distance from the anal verge was 7 cm. The median percentage of lumen occupied by tumor was 50%. The median CEA level was 3.5 ng/mL. The median treatment response was 80%. The mean number of lymph nodes examined was 15 per patient.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of SBRT versus IMRT for low-risk prostate cancer.,American journal of clinical oncology,Am. J. Clin. Oncol.,2014-06-01,"Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has been established as the standard external-beam modality in treating low-risk prostate cancer. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a novel approach involving high-dose radiotherapy in 5 fractions. This analysis compared their cost-effectiveness. A Markov model was constructed to delineate the health states after treatment with IMRT and SBRT. Disease, treatment, and toxicity data were extracted from the literature. Costs included both robotic (R-SBRT) and nonrobotic (NR-SBRT) reimbursement. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed over a wide range of potential parameters. The quality-adjusted life expectancy after IMRT was slightly higher than after SBRT, because we assumed worse toxicity after SBRT. However, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) for IMRT over R-SBRT and NR-SBRT were $285,000 and $591,100/quality-adjusted life year (QALY), respectively. On sensitivity analysis, SBRT was almost always the cost-effective therapy, in which the ICER for IMRT was generally over $100,000/QALY. Reimbursement for R-SBRT versus NR-SBRT significantly influenced its ICER.

Racial disparities in advanced-stage colorectal cancer survival.,Cancer causes & control : CCC,Cancer Causes Control,2013-01-08,"African-Americans (AA) have a higher incidence of and lower survival from colorectal cancer (CRC) compared with European Americans (EA). In the present study, statewide, population-based data from South Carolina Central Cancer Registry are used to investigate the relationship between race and age on advanced-stage CRC survival. The study population was comprised of 3,865 advanced pathologically documented colon and rectal adenocarcinoma cases diagnosed between 01 January 1996 and 31 December 2006: 2,673 (69 %) EA and 1,192 (31 %) AA. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to generate median survival time and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CI) by race, age, and gender. Factors associated with survival were evaluated by fitting Cox proportional hazards regression models to generate hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % CI. We observed a significant interaction between race and age on CRC survival (p = 0.04). Among younger patients (<50 years), AA race was associated with a 1.34 times (95 % CI 1.06-1.71) higher risk of death compared with EA. Among older patients, we observed a modest increase in risk of death among AA men compared with EA [HR 1.16 (95 % CI 1.01-1.32)] but no difference by race between women [HR 0.94 (95 % CI 0.82-1.08)].

Do older Americans undergo stoma reversal following low anterior resection for rectal cancer?,The Journal of surgical research,J. Surg. Res.,2012-12-21,"For low-lying rectal cancers, proximal diversion can reduce anastomotic leak after sphincter-preserving surgery; however, evidence suggests that such temporary diversions are often not reversed. We aimed to evaluate nonreversal and delayed stoma reversal in elderly patients undergoing low anterior resection (LAR). SEER-Medicare-linked analysis from 1991-2007.

(1) Stoma creation and reversal rates; (2) time to reversal; (3) characteristics associated with reversal and shorter time to reversal. Within 18 mo of LAR, 51% of patients (603/1179) underwent stoma reversal. Stoma reversal was associated with age <80 y (P < 0.0001), male sex (P = 0.018), fewer comorbidities (P = 0.017), higher income (quartile 4 versus 1; P = 0.002), early tumor stage (1 versus 3; P < 0.001), neoadjuvant radiation (P < 0.0001), rectal tumor location (versus rectosigmoid; P = 0.001), more recent diagnosis (P = 0.021), and shorter length of stay on LAR admission (P = 0.021). Median time to reversal was 126 d (interquartile range: 79-249). Longer time to reversal was associated with older age (P = 0.031), presence of comorbidities (P = 0.014), more advanced tumor stage (P = 0.007), positive lymph nodes (P = 0.009), receipt of adjuvant radiation therapy (P = 0.008), more recent diagnosis (P = 0.004), and longer length of stay on LAR admission (P < 0.0001).

Comparative analysis of lymph node metastases in patients with ypT0-2 rectal cancers after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2013-02-01,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy before total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer is associated with improved local tumor control, primary tumor regression, and pathologic downstaging. Therefore, tumor response in the bowel wall has been proposed to be used to identify patients for organ-preserving strategies. The aim of this study was to determine the rate of residual lymph node involvement following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy among patients with ypT0-2 residual bowel wall tumor and to comparatively assess their oncologic outcomes following total mesorectal excision. This is a retrospective consecutive cohort study, 1993 to 2008. Patients with stage cII to III rectal carcinoma treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy and total mesorectal excision were included. The primary outcomes measured were the rate of lymph node metastasis by ypT stage, recurrence-free survival, and the frequencies of distant metastasis and local recurrence. Among all 406 ypT0-2 patients, 66 (16.3%) had lymph node metastasis: 20.8% among ypT2, 17.1% among ypT1, and 9.1% among ypT0 patients. Local recurrences (2.0% vs 5.5%; p = 0.038) but not distant metastases (9.3% vs 13.5%; p = 0.38) occurred more frequently in ypN+ than in ypN0 patients. Recurrence-free survival was 85.2% among ypT0-2N0 and 79.6% for ypT0-2N+ patients (p = 0.28). The lack of difference in recurrence-free survival persisted after covariate adjustment (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.77-2.16; p = 0.37). However, among ypT3-4 patients, 5-year recurrence-free survival was significantly lower with lymph node metastasis (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.07-2.12; p = 0.019). Low local recurrence event rate limited further comparison by ypT0-2 subgroups.

Anal versus rectal melanoma:  does site of origin predict outcome?,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2013-02-01,"Anatomic site is a predictive factor in subtypes of cutaneous and mucosal melanoma. The aim of this study was to examine the clinical relevance of location of origin of anorectal melanoma as a prognostic factor. With the use of a prospectively maintained database, clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes were compared according to the site of origin. SETTINGS, PATIENTS, INTERVENTIONS: A retrospective review was conducted of patients diagnosed with anorectal melanoma from 1994 to 2010. Tumors were defined as anal, anorectal, or rectal melanoma according to their anatomic relationship to the dentate line. Clinicopathologic factors were compared by χ2 test. Time-to-event analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Of the 96 patients included (41 with anal melanoma, 32 with anorectal melanoma, 23 with rectal melanoma), patients with rectal and anorectal mucosal melanoma had advanced primary tumors (median Breslow thickness, 12 mm and 8 mm, p = 0.002), whereas anal lesions could be found at earlier depths (median thickness, 6.5 mm). Patients with anal tumors more commonly underwent transanal excision (p < 0.02) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (p = 0.004) versus anorectal and rectal tumors. Patterns of recurrence were also distinct; nearly two-thirds of anorectal and rectal tumors recurred systemically, whereas anal melanoma more often recurred within the lymph nodes first (63%; p < 0.02). Recurrence occurred in 24 (59%) patients with anal tumors, 23 (72%) patients with anorectal tumors, and 16 (70%) patients with rectal tumors. Median overall survival was 22 months for anal melanoma, 28 months for anorectal melanoma, and 27 months for rectal melanoma. Recurrence and survival were not statistically different between the groups. This study is limited by small sample size and its retrospective nature. This study represents the only series describing the outcomes of anorectal melanoma by anatomic location. Lesions at or proximal to the dentate line present with more advanced disease, possibly related to a delay in diagnosis. Lesions distal to the dentate line more commonly recur within lymph nodes, which may represent differences in nodal drainage. Irrespective of location, the long-term prognosis remains poor for all cases of anorectal melanoma.",Journal Article,2545.0,32.0,Anatomic site is a predictive factor in subtypes of cutaneous and mucosal The aim of this study was to examine the clinical relevance of location of origin of anorectal as a prognostic factor With the use of a prospectively maintained database clinical characteristics management and outcomes were compared according to the site of origin SETTINGS PATIENTS INTERVENTIONS A retrospective review was conducted of patients diagnosed with anorectal from 1994 to 2010 Tumors were defined as anorectal or according to their anatomic relationship to the dentate line Clinicopathologic factors were compared by χ2 test Time-to-event analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier analysis Of the 96 patients included 41 with 32 with anorectal 23 with patients with and anorectal mucosal had advanced primary tumors median Breslow thickness 12 mm and 8 mm p 0.002 whereas lesions could be found at earlier depths median thickness 6.5 mm Patients with tumors more commonly underwent transanal excision p 0.02 and sentinel lymph node biopsy p 0.004 versus anorectal and tumors Patterns of recurrence were also distinct nearly two-thirds of anorectal and tumors recurred systemically whereas more often recurred within the lymph nodes first 63 p 0.02 Recurrence occurred in 24 59 patients with tumors 23 72 patients with anorectal tumors and 16 70 patients with tumors Median overall survival was 22 months for 28 months for anorectal and 27 months for Recurrence and survival were not statistically different between the groups This study is limited by small sample size and its retrospective nature This study represents the only series describing the outcomes of anorectal by anatomic location Lesions at or proximal to the dentate line present with more advanced disease possibly related to a delay in diagnosis Lesions distal to the dentate line more commonly recur within lymph nodes which may represent differences in nodal drainage Irrespective of location the long-term prognosis remains poor for all cases of anorectal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[2745, 606, 16, 8, 464, 161, 4, 814, 1, 1486, 2, 3068, 3, 1130, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 1004, 3, 38, 2088, 1, 1147, 1, 1938, 1, 9778, 22, 8, 177, 161, 5, 3, 119, 1, 8, 1143, 1955, 609, 38, 374, 284, 2, 123, 11, 72, 768, 6, 3, 606, 1, 1938, 1947, 7, 1151, 8, 459, 206, 10, 426, 1, 7, 265, 5, 9778, 29, 3023, 6, 1120, 57, 11, 395, 22, 9778, 15, 768, 6, 136, 2745, 858, 6, 3, 28760, 328, 1399, 130, 11, 72, 20, 20721, 412, 98, 6, 774, 65, 10, 173, 20, 876, 882, 65, 1, 3, 921, 7, 159, 605, 5, 531, 5, 9778, 382, 5, 7, 5, 2, 9778, 3068, 42, 131, 86, 57, 52, 6931, 2903, 133, 321, 2, 66, 321, 19, 13, 1111, 547, 406, 359, 40, 204, 28, 1677, 17764, 52, 2903, 49, 33, 321, 7, 5, 57, 80, 841, 208, 11825, 1366, 19, 13, 588, 2, 1323, 263, 289, 411, 19, 13, 1520, 185, 9778, 2, 57, 764, 1, 146, 11, 120, 834, 1857, 100, 5438, 1, 9778, 2, 57, 3363, 6327, 547, 80, 629, 3363, 262, 3, 263, 502, 157, 676, 19, 13, 588, 146, 489, 4, 259, 728, 7, 5, 57, 382, 720, 7, 5, 9778, 57, 2, 245, 431, 7, 5, 57, 52, 63, 25, 10, 350, 53, 9, 339, 53, 9, 9778, 2, 428, 53, 9, 146, 2, 25, 11, 44, 712, 338, 59, 3, 271, 26, 45, 16, 383, 20, 302, 1000, 444, 2, 211, 459, 2202, 26, 45, 1449, 3, 158, 988, 4950, 3, 123, 1, 9778, 20, 2745, 1147, 406, 28, 15, 2805, 6, 3, 28760, 328, 364, 5, 80, 131, 34, 2150, 139, 6, 8, 1984, 4, 147, 406, 2107, 6, 3, 28760, 328, 80, 841, 5609, 262, 263, 502, 92, 68, 1231, 362, 4, 779, 3528, 3500, 1, 1147, 3, 319, 337, 356, 469, 334, 9, 62, 140, 1, 9778]",2008.0,23303142,535
What is the significance of the circumferential margin in locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy?,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2013-01-18,"The circumferential resection margin (CRM) is highly prognostic for local recurrence in rectal cancer surgery without neoadjuvant treatment. However, its significance in the setting of long-course neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) is not well defined. Review of a single institution's prospectively maintained database from 1998 to 2007 identified 563 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (T3/T4 and/or N1) receiving nCRT, followed after 6 weeks by total mesorectal excision (TME). Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression, and competing risk analysis were performed. The authors noted that 75 % of all patients had stage III disease as determined by endorectal ultrasound (ERUS) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). With median follow-up of 39 months after resection, local and distant relapse were noted in 12 (2.1 %) and 98 (17.4 %) patients, respectively. On competing risk analysis, the optimal cutoff point of CRM was 1 mm for local recurrence and 2 mm for distant metastasis. Factors independently associated with local recurrence included CRM ≤1 mm, and high-grade tumor (p = 0.012 and 0.007, respectively). CRM ≤2 mm, as well as pathological, nodal, and overall tumor stage are also significant independent risk factors for distant metastasis (p = 0.025, 0.010, and <0.001, respectively). In this dataset of locally advanced rectal cancer treated with nCRT followed by TME, CRM ≤1 mm is an independent risk factor for local recurrence and is considered a positive margin.

Association of race and socioeconomic status and outcomes of patients with rectal cancer.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2013-01-20,"Few studies have evaluated disparities of race and socioeconomic status (SES) with outcomes in patients with rectal cancer. We hypothesize that disparities exist in the treatment and outcomes among patients with rectal cancer. Medical records of all patients with rectal cancer treated from 2000 to 2009 at an NCI cancer center (Fox Chase Cancer Center) and an urban academic center (Temple University Hospital) were retrospectively reviewed from a prospectively maintained tumor registry database. SES was estimated using census data. Quartiles of income and education based on zip codes were calculated. Lowest vs other quartiles were compared. Clinicopathologic variables included: initial stage, chemotherapy refusal, sphincter preservation, and overall survival (OS). A total of 748 patients were included in the analysis (581 white, 135 black, 6 other, 26 unknown). No difference in race, SES, or insurance status was seen with regard to stage at presentation. Chemotherapy and radiation refusal was rare. After excluding stage IV patients; sphincter preservation was more common among those with higher income. Median OS for all stages was worse for nonwhite patients (31 vs 50 months, p < .001), and those with low income and education.

Measuring colorectal cancer care quality for the publicly insured in New York State.,Cancer medicine,Cancer Med,2012-11-22,"The extent to which concordance with colorectal cancer treatment quality metrics varies by patient characteristics in the publicly insured is not well understood. Our objective was to evaluate the quality of colorectal cancer care for publicly insured residents of New York State (NYS). NYS cancer registry data were linked to Medicaid and Medicare claims and hospital discharge data. We identified colorectal cancer cases diagnosed from 2004 through 2006 and evaluated three treatment quality measures: adjuvant chemotherapy within 4 months of diagnosis for American Joint Cancer Committee (AJCC) stage III colon cancer, adjuvant radiation within 6 months of diagnosis for AJCC stage IIB or III rectal cancer, and adjuvant chemotherapy within 9 months of diagnosis for AJCC stage II-III rectal cancer. Concordance with guidelines was evaluated separately for Medicaid-enrollees under age 65 years and Medicare-enrollees aged 65-79 years. For adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer, 79.4% (274/345) of the Medicaid cohort and 71.8% (585/815) of the Medicare cohort were guideline concordant. For adjuvant radiation for rectal cancer, 72.3% (125/173) of the Medicaid cohort and 66.9% (206/308) of the Medicare cohort were concordant. For adjuvant chemotherapy for rectal cancer, 89.5% (238/266) of the Medicaid cohort and 76.0% (392/516) of the Medicare cohort were concordant.

"ACR Appropriateness Criteria prostate cancer--pretreatment detection, staging, and surveillance.",Journal of the American College of Radiology : JACR,J Am Coll Radiol,2013-02-01,"Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous male malignancy in the United States. The use of serum prostate-specific antigen as a screening tool is complicated by a significant fraction of nonlethal cancers diagnosed by biopsy. Ultrasound is used predominately as a biopsy guidance tool. Combined rectal examination, prostate-specific antigen testing, and histology from ultrasound-guided biopsy provide risk stratification for locally advanced and metastatic disease. Imaging in low-risk patients is unlikely to guide management for patients electing up-front treatment. MRI, CT, and bone scans are appropriate in intermediate-risk to high-risk patients to better assess the extent of disease, guide therapy decisions, and predict outcomes. MRI (particularly with an endorectal coil and multiparametric functional imaging) provides the best imaging for cancer detection and staging. There may be a role for prostate MRI in the context of active surveillance for low-risk patients and in cancer detection for undiagnosed clinically suspected cancer after negative biopsy results. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel.

Anastomotic leak following low anterior resection in stage IV rectal cancer is associated with poor survival.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg.

The risk of leak in stage IV rectal cancer patients treated with synchronous or staged resection of the primary tumour and metastatic sites has not been reported. We measured the incidence of anastomotic leak and its association with clinical outcome. With institutional review board approval, patients undergoing LAR and resection of metastatic disease were analyzed from a prospectively collected colorectal database between 1992 and 2010. Data for use of ileostomy, clinical anastomotic leak, and clinical risk score (for liver metastases, n = 86) were collected. Categorical variables were compared with the χ(2) test. Estimated overall survival was compared using log-rank method and Cox regression analysis. A total of 184 patients with LAR and stage IV disease were identified. Of those, 123 had curative resection for disease at distant sites. 72 % underwent simultaneous resection, 28 % staged resection. Median follow-up was 2.9 years for survivors. Anastomotic leak occurred in 6.5 %. There was one perioperative death (not attributable to leak). Overall 3-year survival following a leak was significantly worse compared with patients without a leak (35 vs. 73 %, P = 0.01). Clinical leak was associated with worse survival when controlled for use of diverting stoma, operative year, clinical risk score, and timing of resection of metastatic disease.

Impact of diabetes on oncologic outcome of colorectal cancer patients: colon vs. rectal cancer.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2013-02-06,"To evaluate the impact of diabetes on outcomes in colorectal cancer patients and to examine whether this association varies by the location of tumor (colon vs. rectum). This study includes 4,131 stage I-III colorectal cancer patients, treated between 1995 and 2007 (12.5% diabetic, 53% colon, 47% rectal) in South Korea. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to determine the prognostic influence of DM on survival endpoints. Colorectal cancer patients with DM had significantly worse disease-free survival (DFS) [hazard ratio (HR) 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00-1.37] compared with patients without DM. When considering colon and rectal cancer independently, DM was significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS) (HR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.11-1.92), DFS (HR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.15-1.84) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (HR: 1.32, 95% CI: 0.98-1.76) in colon cancer patients.

"Prospective analysis of body mass index, physical activity, and colorectal cancer risk associated with β-catenin (CTNNB1) status.",Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2013-02-26,"Dysregulation of the WNT/β-catenin (CTNNB1) signaling pathway is implicated in colorectal carcinoma and metabolic diseases. Considering these roles and cancer prevention, we hypothesized that tumor CTNNB1 status might influence cellular sensitivity to obesity and physical activity. In clinical follow-up of 109,046 women in the Nurses' Health Study and 47,684 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, there were 861 incident rectal and colon cancers with tissue immunohistochemistry data on nuclear CTNNB1 expression. Using this molecular pathological epidemiology database, we conducted Cox proportional hazards regression analysis using data duplication method to assess differential associations of body mass index (BMI) or exercise activity with colorectal cancer risk according to tumor CTNNB1 status. Greater BMI was associated with a significantly higher risk of CTNNB1-negative cancer [multivariate HR = 1.34; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.18-1.53 for 5.0 kg/m(2) increment; Ptrend = 0.0001] but not with CTNNB1-positive cancer risk (multivariate HR = 1.07; 95% CI, 0.92-1.25 for 5.0 kg/m(2) increment; Ptrend = 0.36; Pheterogeneity = 0.027, between CTNNB1-negative and CTNNB1-positive cancer risks). Physical activity level was associated with a lower risk of CTNNB1-negative cancer (multivariate HR = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87-1.00 for 10 MET-h/wk increment; Ptrend = 0.044) but not with CTNNB1-positive cancer risk (multivariate HR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91-1.05 for 10 MET-h/wk increment; Ptrend = 0.60). Our findings argue that obesity and physical inactivity are associated with a higher risk of CTNNB1-negative colorectal cancer but not with CTNNB1-positive cancer risk. Furthermore, they suggest that energy balance and metabolism status exerts its effect in a specific carcinogenesis pathway that is less likely dependent on WNT/CTNNB1 activation.

Can one blood draw replace transrectal ultrasonography-estimated prostate volume to predict prostate cancer risk?,BJU international,BJU Int.,2013-02-28,"To explore whether a panel of kallikrein markers in blood: total, free and intact prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and kallikrein-related peptidase 2, could be used as a non-invasive alternative for predicting prostate cancer on biopsy in a screening setting. The study cohort comprised previously unscreened men who underwent sextant biopsy owing to elevated PSA (≥3 ng/mL) in two different centres of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer, Rotterdam (n = 2914) and Göteborg (n = 740). A statistical model, based on kallikrein markers, was compared with one based on established clinical factors for the prediction of biopsy outcome. The clinical tests were found to be no better than blood markers, with an area under the curve in favour of the blood measurements of 0.766 vs. 0.763 in Rotterdam and 0.809 vs. 0.774 in Göteborg. Adding digital rectal examination (DRE) or DRE plus transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) volume to the markers improved discrimination, although the increases were small. Results were similar for predicting high-grade cancer. There was a strong correlation between the blood measurements and TRUS-estimated prostate volume (Spearman's correlation 0.60 in Rotterdam and 0.57 in Göteborg). In previously unscreened men, each with indication for biopsy, a statistical model based on kallikrein levels was similar to a clinical model in predicting prostate cancer in a screening setting, outside the day-to-day clinical practice.

Subjects were 42 consecutive men from a prospective study of brachytherapy as monotherapy with (125)I for intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer. No patient received hormonal therapy. Preplanning constraints included prostate V100 higher than 95%, V150 lower than 60%, and V200 lower than 20% and rectal R100 less than 1cm(3). Patients completed the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite quality-of-life questionnaire before and at 1, 4, 8, and 12 months after implantation, and urinary domain scores were analyzed. All structures including the IUS and EUS were contoured on T2-weighted MRI at day 30, and doses received were calculated from identification of seeds on CT. Spearman's (nonparametric) rank correlation coefficient (ρ) was used for statistical analyses. Overall urinary morbidity was worst at 1 month after the implant. Urinary function declined when the IUS V285 was 0.4% (ρ=-0.32, p=0.04); bother worsened when the IUS V35 was 99% (ρ=-0.31, p=0.05) or the EUS V240 was 63% (ρ=-0.31, p=0.05); irritation increased when the IUS V35 was 95% (ρ=-0.37, p=0.02) and the EUS V265 was 24% (ρ=-0.32, p=0.04); and urgency worsened when the IUS V35 was 99.5% (ρ=-0.38, p=0.02).

An individualized conditional survival calculator for patients with rectal cancer.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2013-05-01,"Conditional survival estimates account for time survived since diagnosis to provide prognostic information for long-term cancer survivors. For rectal cancer, stage-related treatment (eg, neoadjuvant radiotherapy) affects pathologic stage and therefore stage-associated survival estimates. The aim of this study is to estimate conditional survival for patients who have rectal cancer and to develop an interactive calculator to use for individualized patient counseling. Patients with rectal adenocarcinoma were identified by using the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results registry (1988-2002, N = 22,610). Cox regression models were developed to determine adjusted survival estimates (years 1-10) and used to calculate 5-year adjusted conditional survival. Models were built separately for no radiotherapy, preoperative radiotherapy, postoperative radiotherapy, and patients with stage IV disease. Covariates included age, sex, race, tumor grade, and type of surgery. An Internet-based conditional survival calculator was developed. Radiotherapy was given to 42.6% of patients (14.1% preoperative, 28.4% postoperative). Significant improvements in 5-year conditional survival were observed for all stages, with the exception of stage I because of the initial high survival probability at diagnosis. Patients with advanced stage had the greatest improvements in conditional survival, with 5-year absolute increases of 33% (stage IIIC) and 54% (IV). Other factors associated with conditional survival included sequence of radiotherapy and surgery, age, race, and tumor grade. The Internet-based conditional survival calculator can be accessed at www.mdanderson.org/rectalcalculator. The data source used does not include information on chemotherapy treatment, change in staging after neoadjuvant treatment, or patient comorbidities. Conditional survival estimates improve over 5 years in patients who have rectal cancer; the greatest improvements are observed among patients with advanced stage disease.

The effect of anterior proton beams in the setting of a prostate-rectum spacer.,Medical dosimetry : official journal of the American Association of Medical Dosimetrists,Med Dosim,2013-04-08,"Studies suggest that anterior beams with in vivo range verification would improve rectal dosimetry in proton therapy for prostate cancer. We investigated whether prostate-rectum spacers would enhance or diminish the benefits of anterior proton beams in these treatments. Twenty milliliters of hydrogel was injected between the prostate and rectum of a cadaver using a transperineal approach. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images were used to generate 7 uniform scanning (US) and 7 single-field uniform dose pencil-beam scanning (PBS) plans with different beam arrangements. Pearson correlations were calculated between rectal, bladder, and femoral head dosimetric outcomes and beam arrangement anterior scores, which characterize the degree to which dose is delivered anteriorly. The overall quality of each plan was compared using a virtual dose-escalation study. For US plans, rectal mean dose was inversely correlated with anterior score, but for PBS plans there was no association between rectal mean dose and anterior score. For both US and PBS plans, full bladder and empty bladder mean doses were correlated with anterior scores. For both US and PBS plans, femoral head mean doses were inversely correlated with anterior score. For US plans and a full bladder, 4 beam arrangements that included an anterior beam tied for the highest maximum prescription dose (MPD). For US plans and an empty bladder, the arrangement with 1 anterior and 2 anterior oblique beams achieved the highest MPD in the virtual dose-escalation study. The dose-escalation study did not differentiate beam arrangements for PBS. All arrangements in the dose-escalation study were limited by bladder constraints except for the arrangement with 2 posterior oblique beams. The benefits of anterior proton beams in the setting of prostate-rectum spacers appear to be proton modality dependent and may not extend to PBS.

Using NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology to measure the quality of colorectal cancer care in the veterans health administration.,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,2013-04-01,"Clinical practice guidelines can be used to help develop measures of quality of cancer care.

The CCQMS assessed practice guideline concordance primarily based on colon (14 indicators) and rectal (11 indicators) cancer care guidelines of the NCCN. Indicators were developed with input from VHA stakeholders with the goal of examining the continuum of diagnosis, neoadjuvant therapy, surgery, adjuvant therapy, and survivorship surveillance and/or end-of-life care. In addition, 9 measures of timeliness of cancer care were developed. The measures/indicators formed the basis of a computerized data abstraction tool that produced reports on quality of care in real-time as data were entered. The tool was developed for a 28-facility learning collaborative, the Colorectal Cancer Care Collaborative (C4), aimed at improving colorectal cancer (CRC) care quality. Data on 1373 incident stage I-IV CRC cases were entered over approximately 18 months and were used to target and monitor quality improvement activities.

Using molecular pathological epidemiology database of 605 stage I-III colon and rectal cancers in two prospective cohort studies (the Nurse's Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study), we examined patient survival according to postdiagnosis physical activity and tumor PTGS2 status (with 382 PTGS2-positive and 223 PTGS2-negative tumors by immunohistochemistry). Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate colorectal cancer-specific mortality HR, adjusting for clinical and other tumor variables including microsatellite instability status. Among PTGS2-positive cases, compared with the least active first quartile, the multivariate HRs (95% confidence interval) were 0.30 (0.14-0.62) for the second, 0.38 (0.20-0.71) for the third, and 0.18 (0.08-0.41) for the fourth quartile of physical activity level (Ptrend = 0.0002).

Role of preoperative MR imaging in the evaluation of patients with persistent or recurrent gynaecological malignancies before pelvic exenteration.,European radiology,Eur Radiol,2013-05-08,"To determine the diagnostic performance of MRI in assessing local tumour extent and evaluate associations between MRI features and survival in patients undergoing MRI before pelvic exenteration for persistent or recurrent gynaecological cancers. The study included 50 patients with persistent or recurrent gynaecological malignancies who underwent pelvic exenteration between January 1999 and December 2011 and had MRI at most 90 days before surgery. Two radiologists independently assessed invasion of adjacent organs (on a 5-point scale). Diagnostic accuracy, inter-reader agreement, and associations between organ invasion on MRI and patient survival were evaluated. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for invasion of the bladder, rectum and pelvic sidewall were 0.96, 0.90 and 0.98 for reader 1 and 0.95, 0.88 and 0.90 for reader 2.

This study characterized long-term BF and evaluated quality of life (QOL) in patients receiving PRT. Data from 252 patients were compiled from two North Central Cancer Treatment Group prospective studies, which included assessment of BF and QOL by the BF questionnaire (BFQ) and Uniscale QOL at baseline and 12 and 24 months after completion of radiotherapy. BFQ scores (sum of symptoms), Uniscale results, adverse-event incidence, and baseline demographic data were compared via t test, χ (2), Fisher exact, Wilcoxon, and correlation methodologies. The total BFQ score was higher than baseline at 12 and 24 months (P < 0.001). More patients had five or more symptoms at 12 months (13 %) and 24 months (10 %) than at baseline (2 %). Symptoms occurring in greater than 20 % of patients at 12 and 24 months were clustering, stool-gas confusion, and urgency. Factors associated with worse BF were female sex, rectal or gynecologic primary tumors, prior anterior resection of the rectum, and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy. Patients experiencing grade 2 or higher acute toxicity had worse 24-month BF (P values, <.001-.02).

Clinical utility of KRAS and BRAF mutations in a cohort of patients with colorectal neoplasms submitted for microsatellite instability testing.,Clinical colorectal cancer,Clin Colorectal Cancer,2013-06-14,"Molecular analysis has become important in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) evaluation. Alterations in KRAS, BRAF, or mismatch repair (MMR) genes may determine therapeutic response or define a hereditary cancer syndrome. Correlation of DNA studies with clinical findings will further clarify the clinical utility of these markers. A retrospective study was performed on 111 paraffin-embedded tumor specimens submitted for microsatellite instability (MSI) testing based on clinical history or histologic examination, or both. DNA samples were screened for 7 KRAS mutations and the BRAF p.V600E mutation using fluorescent allele-specific polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) and capillary electrophoresis. Clinical data were collected through chart review. Fifty-eight male and 53 female patients were studied. The incidence of KRAS and BRAF mutations was 49.5% and 7.2%, respectively. Dideoxy sequencing verified KRAS mutation status in 46 of 49 specimens tested. There was a trend toward significance of individual KRAS mutations on survival (P = .003). Dually positive KRAS and MSI tumors exclusively demonstrated p.G12D and p.G13D mutations (G>A transitions). BRAF-mutated tumors were predominantly right-sided and associated with a borderline worse prognosis. Forty-eight percent of tumors with MSI were present in the left colon or rectum. Allele-specific PCR is an accurate and convenient method to assess KRAS and BRAF mutations and may detect mutations not identified by dideoxy sequencing. KRAS mutation status, in conjunction with morphologic or clinical parameters, may be useful in determining whether a tumor should be tested for MSI.

"Dietary intakes of red meat, poultry, and fish during high school and risk of colorectal adenomas in women.",American journal of epidemiology,Am. J. Epidemiol.,2013-06-19,"Adolescent diet may be etiologically relevant for colorectal carcinogenesis. We examined the association between meat and fish intakes during adolescence and the risk of colorectal adenomas later in life among 19,771 women participating in the Nurses' Health Study II. Subjects had completed a validated food frequency questionnaire in 1998 (when aged 34-51 years) about their diets during high school and subsequently underwent at least 1 lower-bowel endoscopy during the study period (1998-2007). During this period, 1,494 subjects were diagnosed with colorectal adenomas. Intake of red meat during adolescence was not associated with colorectal adenoma risk when comparing those in the highest versus lowest category of intake (odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81, 1.35). Similarly, intake of fish during adolescence was not associated with colorectal adenoma risk (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.78, 1.17). Intake of poultry during adolescence was associated with a lower risk of total colorectal (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.99), distal (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.99), rectal (OR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.29, 0.90), and advanced (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.38, 0.93) adenomas. Replacement of 1 serving per day of red meat with 1 serving per day of poultry or fish was associated with 41% and 35% decreased risks for rectal adenomas and advanced adenomas, respectively.

A prospective study of duration of smoking cessation and colorectal cancer risk by epigenetics-related tumor classification.,American journal of epidemiology,Am. J. Epidemiol.,2013-06-20,"The effect of duration of cigarette smoking cessation on colorectal cancer risk by molecular subtypes remains unclear.

Follow-up of 134,204 individuals in 2 US nationwide prospective cohorts (Nurses' Health Study (1980-2008) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2008)) resulted in 1,260 incident rectal and colon cancers with available molecular data.

Differential associations between smoking cessation and cancer risks by microsatellite instability (Pheterogeneity = 0.02), DNMT3B expression (Pheterogeneity = 0.03), and BRAF (Pheterogeneity = 0.10) status appeared to be driven by the associations of CIMP-high cancer with microsatellite instability-high, DNMT3B-positive, and BRAF-mutated cancers.

Experimental evidence implicates a role of RAF kinases in up-regulation of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2, cyclooxygenase 2), suggesting that BRAF-mutant colonic cells might be less sensitive to the antitumor effects of aspirin than BRAF-wild-type neoplastic cells. To examine whether the association of aspirin intake with colorectal cancer risk differs according to status of tumor BRAF oncogene mutation. We collected biennial questionnaire data on aspirin use and followed up participants in the Nurses' Health Study (from 1980) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (from 1986) until July 1, 2006, for cancer incidence and until January 1, 2012, for cancer mortality. Duplication-method Cox proportional cause-specific hazards regression for competing risks data was used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) for colorectal carcinoma incidence according to BRAF mutation status. Incidence of colorectal cancer cases according to tumor BRAF mutation status. Among 127,865 individuals, with 3,165,985 person-years of follow-up, we identified 1226 incident rectal and colon cancers with available molecular data. Compared with nonuse, regular aspirin use was associated with lower BRAF-wild-type cancer risk (multivariable HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.83; age-adjusted incidence rate difference [RD], -9.7; 95% CI, -12.6 to -6.7 per 100,000 person-years). This association was observed irrespective of status of tumor PTGS2 expression or PIK3CA or KRAS mutation. In contrast, regular aspirin use was not associated with a lower risk of BRAF-mutated cancer (multivariable HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.38; age-adjusted, incidence RD, 0.7; 95% CI, -0.3 to 1.7 per 100,000 person-years: P for heterogeneity = .037, between BRAF-wild-type vs BRAF-mutated cancer risks). Compared with no aspirin use, aspirin use of more than 14 tablets per week was associated with a lower risk of BRAF-wild-type cancer (multivariable HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.75; age-adjusted incidence RD, -19.8; 95% CI, -26.3 to -13.3 per 100,000 person-years). The relationship between the number of aspirin tablets per week and colorectal cancer risk differed significantly by BRAF mutation status (P for heterogeneity = .005). Regular aspirin use was associated with lower risk of BRAF-wild-type colorectal cancer but not with BRAF-mutated cancer risk.

All individuals underwent radical resection for rectal cancer with or without neoadjuvant therapy. Rate of margin positivity determined and adjusted for patient- and tumor-related factors to calculate expected margin positivity per hospital. An observed to expected ratio was calculated based on patient- and tumor-related factors to identify treatment-associated variation. The overall margin-positive resection rate was 5.2%. Patients with margins positive for cancer were more likely to be older, male, and African American; not have private insurance; and have their cancer diagnosed later in the study period. Associated tumor-related factors include rectal location, higher American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, signet/mucinous histology, and poor/undifferentiated grade. Among hospitals that were significantly low outliers, 47% were comprehensive community hospitals, and 43.9% were academic/research hospitals; of those that were significantly high outliers, 52.3% were comprehensive community hospitals, and 17.8% were academic/research hospitals. High-volume centers made up 80% of significantly low outlier hospitals and 17% of significantly high outlier hospitals. The rates of chemotherapy and radiation were similar, but low outlier hospitals gave more neoadjuvant radiation (26.3% vs 17%).

Evolving role of neoadjuvant therapy in rectal cancer.,Current treatment options in oncology,Curr Treat Options Oncol,2013-09-01,"Management of locally advanced rectal cancer is complex because curative treatment routinely involves administration of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Optimal treatment delivery sequencing and timing are challenging, and moreover, there is considerable heterogeneity in risk based on rectal tumor location, extent, and nodal involvement. The goal in rectal cancer treatment is to optimize disease-free and overall survival while minimizing the risk of local recurrence and toxicity from both radiation and systemic therapy. Currently, the standard approach to management of locally advanced (T3 or T2) rectal cancer involves careful staging with a pelvic MRI and proctoscopic evaluation by a surgeon experienced in total mesorectal excision. MRI can help to distinguish between patients in low-, intermediate-, and high-risk categories. Low-risk tumors have no evidence of either extramural spread or nodal involvement and proximal location in the rectum. For such patients, R0 resection is almost always possible and immediate surgery often is reasonable. In the minority of cases where unanticipated lymph node involvement is detected at surgical pathology, postoperative radiation can be administered. Patients who opt for up-front rectal surgery need to understand that although there is a chance that radiation can be avoided, if it is necessary, it is less well tolerated when administered postoperatively. Initial surgical treatment should be reserved for low-risk patients for whom imaging indicates and multidisciplinary team members feel is able to undergo an R0 resection with low chance for regional spread of disease. For patients with high-risk disease based on distal tumor location requiring an APR, threatened radial margins, or T4 tumors, preoperative chemoradiation is essential. Indeed, this approach increases the likelihood of complete surgical resection with negative margins. For some high-risk patients, for example those with T4 or bulky nodal disease, preoperative systemic therapy followed by preoperative chemoradiation and then surgery may be optimal. The feasibility of this approach is well established based on nonrandomized trials, but it has not been evaluated in a randomized study. Preoperative administration of systemic therapy can achieve clinical downstaging, optimize rates of sphincter preservation, and establish tumor responsiveness, which may be valuable for incorporation into future treatment decisions. For patients with intermediate-risk T3 rectal cancers, for example, a cT3N1 tumor 7 cm from the anal verge with two to three regional lymph nodes in the 7-mm range, we encourage participation in the PROSPECT randomized trial, which is now open and accruing at numerous centers in North America, and shortly in Europe and South America as well. This study will determine in the era of optimal imaging, surgical technique, and better systemic chemotherapy, whether pelvic radiation remains an essential component of curative treatment. The PROSPECT study uses chemoradiation selectively rather than automatically and customizes subsequent treatment based on response to neoadjuvant FOLFOX. Clinical trials with interventions that tailor treatment to more precisely defined clinical subgroups based on both initial features and tumor responsiveness are expected to become the norm. Although this trend is likely to make clinical trial design more complex, customized treatment strategies are likely to achieve the optimal balance between under- and overtreatment and will address the heterogeneity of both tumor biology and disease presentation. For now, treatment for a patient with clinical T3N1 tumor in the mid rectum consists of the following components: ·Neoadjvuant chemoradiation with either 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine as sensitizing therapy. ·Low anterior resection with total mesorectal excision. Typically a temporary diverting ostomy is required. ·Postoperative administration of adjuvant systemic therapy, 8 cycles of FOLFOX is appropriate, although oxaliplatin should be omitted for early signs of peripheral neuropathy or on the basis of age/comorbidity. Although this is the current care standard, there is concern that such extensive treatment is not necessary for all patients to prevent local recurrence and to optimize cure. To determine if therapy can be streamlined, participation in PROSPECT or other clinical trials asking compelling clinical questions is a priority.",Journal Article,2333.0,26.0,Management of locally advanced cancer is complex because curative treatment routinely involves administration of surgery chemotherapy and radiation Optimal treatment delivery sequencing and timing are challenging and moreover there is considerable heterogeneity in risk based on tumor location extent and nodal involvement The goal in cancer treatment is to optimize disease-free and overall survival while minimizing the risk of local recurrence and toxicity from both radiation and systemic therapy Currently the standard approach to management of locally advanced T3 or T2 cancer involves careful staging with a pelvic MRI and proctoscopic evaluation by a surgeon experienced in total mesorectal excision MRI can help to distinguish between patients in low- intermediate- and high-risk categories Low-risk tumors have no evidence of either extramural spread or nodal involvement and proximal location in the rectum For such patients R0 resection is almost always possible and immediate surgery often is reasonable In the minority of cases where unanticipated lymph node involvement is detected at surgical pathology postoperative radiation can be administered Patients who opt for up-front surgery need to understand that although there is a chance that radiation can be avoided if it is necessary it is less well tolerated when administered postoperatively Initial surgical treatment should be reserved for low-risk patients for whom imaging indicates and multidisciplinary team members feel is able to undergo an R0 resection with low chance for regional spread of disease For patients with high-risk disease based on distal tumor location requiring an APR threatened radial margins or T4 tumors preoperative chemoradiation is essential Indeed this approach increases the likelihood of complete surgical resection with negative margins For some high-risk patients for example those with T4 or bulky nodal disease preoperative systemic therapy followed by preoperative chemoradiation and then surgery may be optimal The feasibility of this approach is well established based on nonrandomized trials but it has not been evaluated in a randomized study Preoperative administration of systemic therapy can achieve clinical downstaging optimize rates of sphincter preservation and establish tumor responsiveness which may be valuable for incorporation into future treatment decisions For

"Phase I safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation of the vascular disrupting agent ombrabulin (AVE8062) in patients with advanced solid tumors.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2013-07-05,"The vascular disrupting agent ombrabulin rapidly reduces tumor blood flow and causes necrosis in vivo. A phase I dose-escalation study was designed to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of single-agent ombrabulin administered once every three weeks in patients with advanced solid malignancies. Ombrabulin (30-minute infusion) was escalated from 6 to 60 mg/m2, with RP2D cohort expansion. Safety, tumor response, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic biomarkers were evaluated. Eleven dose levels were evaluated in 105 patients. Two patients had dose-limiting toxicities in cycle 1 during escalation: grade 3 abdominal pain at 50 mg/m2, grade 3 tumor pain/grade 3 hypertension at 60 mg/m2, and the RP2D was 50 mg/m2 (39 patients). Common toxicities were headache, asthenia, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, transient hypertension, anemia, and lymphopenia. No clinically significant QTc prolongations or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decreases occurred. Ombrabulin was rapidly converted to its active metabolite RPR258063 (half-life 17 minutes and 8.7 hours, respectively), both having dose-proportional exposure. Weak inhibition of CYP2C19-mediated metabolism occurred at the clinical doses used and there was no effect on CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. A patient with rectal cancer had a partial response and eight patients had stable disease lasting four months or more. Circulating endothelial cells (CEC), VEGF, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 levels increased significantly six to 10 hours postinfusion in a subset of patients. The recommended schedule for single-agent ombrabulin is 50 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. CECs, VEGF, and MMP-9 are potential biomarkers of ombrabulin activity.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",2391.0,29.0,The vascular disrupting agent ombrabulin rapidly reduces tumor blood flow and causes necrosis in vivo A phase I dose-escalation study was designed to determine the recommended phase II dose RP2D of single-agent ombrabulin administered once every three weeks in patients with advanced solid malignancies Ombrabulin 30-minute infusion was escalated from 6 to 60 mg/m2 with RP2D cohort expansion Safety tumor response pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic biomarkers were evaluated Eleven dose levels were evaluated in 105 patients Two patients had dose-limiting toxicities in cycle 1 during escalation grade 3 abdominal pain at 50 mg/m2 grade 3 tumor pain/grade 3 hypertension at 60 mg/m2 and the RP2D was 50 mg/m2 39 patients Common toxicities were headache asthenia abdominal pain nausea diarrhea transient hypertension anemia and lymphopenia No clinically significant QTc prolongations or left ventricular ejection fraction LVEF decreases occurred Ombrabulin was rapidly converted to its active metabolite RPR258063 half-life 17 minutes and 8.7 hours respectively both having dose-proportional exposure Weak inhibition of CYP2C19-mediated metabolism occurred at the clinical doses used and there was no effect on CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 A patient with cancer had a partial response and eight patients had stable disease lasting four months or more Circulating endothelial cells CEC VEGF and matrix metalloproteinase MMP -9 levels increased significantly six to 10 hours postinfusion in a subset of patients The recommended schedule for single-agent ombrabulin is 50 mg/m2 every 3 weeks CECs VEGF and MMP-9 are potential biomarkers of ombrabulin activity,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[3, 756, 6242, 420, 17530, 1755, 2389, 30, 315, 1412, 2, 1626, 1523, 4, 386, 8, 124, 70, 61, 1125, 45, 10, 1114, 6, 223, 3, 793, 124, 215, 61, 3977, 1, 226, 420, 17530, 468, 1059, 454, 169, 244, 4, 7, 5, 131, 537, 441, 17530, 201, 3949, 904, 10, 2842, 29, 49, 6, 335, 81, 821, 5, 3977, 180, 1422, 367, 30, 51, 1159, 2, 2424, 582, 11, 194, 2627, 61, 148, 11, 194, 4, 3263, 7, 100, 7, 42, 61, 817, 385, 4, 417, 14, 190, 1125, 88, 27, 1467, 559, 28, 212, 81, 821, 88, 27, 30, 559, 88, 27, 1824, 28, 335, 81, 821, 2, 3, 3977, 10, 212, 81, 821, 587, 7, 186, 385, 11, 4538, 6230, 1467, 559, 1218, 1172, 2473, 1824, 1545, 2, 3655, 77, 505, 93, 6725, 63047, 15, 1712, 4028, 5420, 1509, 3993, 2140, 489, 17530, 10, 1755, 4764, 6, 211, 544, 3379, 63048, 1303, 358, 269, 2511, 2, 66, 67, 1459, 106, 110, 1041, 61, 831, 645, 4241, 297, 1, 14028, 517, 1600, 489, 28, 3, 38, 415, 95, 2, 125, 10, 77, 254, 23, 13132, 2, 6208, 8, 69, 5, 12, 42, 8, 450, 51, 2, 659, 7, 42, 585, 34, 3443, 294, 53, 15, 80, 1033, 845, 37, 14569, 618, 2, 2248, 4914, 2151, 83, 148, 101, 97, 437, 6, 79, 1459, 20245, 4, 8, 697, 1, 7, 3, 793, 1055, 9, 226, 420, 17530, 16, 212, 81, 821, 454, 27, 244, 7361, 618, 2, 2151, 83, 32, 174, 582, 1, 17530, 128]",1647.0,23833302,312
Plasma adiponectin and soluble leptin receptor and risk of colorectal cancer: a prospective study.,"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",Cancer Prev Res (Phila),2013-07-19,"Adipokines are adipocyte-secreted hormones that may mediate the etiologic link between obesity and colorectal cancer; however, the evidence from large prospective studies is limited. We prospectively evaluated the association of plasma adiponectin and soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R) with colorectal cancer risk within the Nurses' Health Study (1990-2008) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1994-2008) among 616 incident colorectal cancer cases and 1,205 controls selected using risk-set sampling and matched on age and date of blood draw. In unconditional logistic regression with adjustment for matching factors and multiple risk factors, plasma adiponectin was significantly associated with reduced risk of colorectal cancer among men, but not among women. Compared with men in the lowest quartile of adiponectin, men in the highest quartile had a relative risk (RR) for colorectal cancer of 0.55 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.35-0.86; Ptrend = 0.02]. The corresponding RR in women was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.67-1.39; Ptrend = 0.74). Plasma sOB-R was not associated with overall colorectal cancer risk in either men or women.

Postoperative Days 1 and 30 dosimetry was done by CT-MRI fusion. Small PVs had greater Day 1 swelling than large PVs (32.5% increase in volume vs. 23.7%, p = 0.04), but by Day 30, swelling was minimal and not significantly different (p = 0.44).

Genetic predictors of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin d and risk of colorectal cancer.,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev.,2013-08-27,"Experimental evidence has demonstrated an antineoplastic role for vitamin D in the colon, and higher circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels are consistently associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer. Genome-wide association studies have identified loci associated with levels of circulating 25(OH)D. The identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from four gene regions collectively explain approximately 5% of the variance in circulating 25(OH)D. We investigated whether five polymorphisms in GC, CYP2R1, CYP24A1, and DHCR7/NADSYN1, genes previously shown to be associated with circulating 25(OH)D levels, were associated with colorectal cancer risk in 10,061 cases and 12,768 controls drawn from 13 studies included in the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO) and Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR). We conducted a meta-analysis of crude and multivariate-adjusted logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios and associated confidence intervals for SNPs individually, SNPs simultaneously, and for a vitamin D additive genetic risk score (GRS). We did not observe a statistically significant association between the 25(OH)D-associated SNPs and colorectal cancer marginally, conditionally, or as a GRS, or for colon or rectal cancer separately. Our findings do not support an association between SNPs associated with circulating 25(OH)D and risk of colorectal cancer. Additional work is warranted to investigate the complex relationship between 25(OH)D and colorectal cancer risk.

Patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma treated with preoperative CRT (n = 79) were identified. A clinical cancer genotyping assay evaluated 140 hotspot mutation sites across 15 cancer genes in 47 patients with sufficient tissue. Mutational profiles were compared in pre- and post-CRT specimens and with pCR rate. Clinical variables were evaluated using logistic regression. Genotyping identified mutations in KRAS (43%), APC (17%), BRAF (4%), NRAS (4%), PIK3CA (4%), and TP53 (11%). In the entire cohort, 21.5% had a pCR. No patients with BRAF, NRAS, APC, or TP53 achieved a pCR. pCR rate was 23.5% (4/17) in wild-type tumors versus 3.3% (1/30) in those with a mutation. There was no difference in the mutation rates in pre- versus post-CRT specimens. On univariate analysis, clinical predictors of pCR included post-RT carcinoembriogenic antigen level of ≤2.5 and smaller tumor size. No patients with a pCR developed recurrence.

Impact of ileostomy-related complications on the multidisciplinary treatment of rectal cancer.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2013-10-02,"Radical resection is the primary treatment for rectal cancer. When anastomosis is possible, a temporary ileostomy is used to decrease morbidity from a poorly healed anastomosis. However, ileostomies are associated with complications, dehydration, and need for a second operation. We sought to evaluate the impact of ileostomy-related complications on the treatment of rectal cancer. We conducted a retrospective study of patients who underwent sphincter-preserving surgery between January 2005 and December 2010 at a tertiary cancer center. The primary outcome was the overall rate of ileostomy-related complications. Secondary outcomes included complications related to ileostomy status, ileostomy closure, anastomotic complications at primary resection, rate of stoma closure, and completion of adjuvant chemotherapy assessed by multivariate logistic regression. Of 294 patients analyzed, 32% (n = 95) were women. Two hundred seventy-one (92%) received neoadjuvant chemoradiation. The median tumor distance from the anal verge was 7 cm (interquartile range 5-10 cm). Two hundred eighty-one (96%) underwent stoma closure at a median of 7 months (interquartile range 5.4-8.3 months). The most common complication related to readmission was dehydration (n = 32-11%).

Management of recurrent rectal cancer: practical insights in planning and surgical intervention.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2013-10-10,"Over the last two decades the oncologic treatment results for primary rectal cancer have improved due to refinements in neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. Nevertheless, there is still a 10% rate of local recurrence, threatening the survival and quality of life of affected patients. Due to variability of anatomy and clinical presentation, detection, staging, and clinical management are complex. Without treatment, patients will suffer from progressive local symptoms-pain, obstruction, hemorrhage, sepsis-and rarely survive beyond five years. The overall goals of surgical treatment-complete tumor resection, preservation of function, and avoidance of complications-are identical to those of surgery for primary rectal cancer, but are unfortunately much more difficult to achieve in the setting of recurrence. Tumor resection is highly challenging, as the surgical field has generally been anatomically disrupted and irradiated, and the tumors are typically adherent or invasive into organs in the middle and low pelvis. Standard total mesorectal excision (TME) resections are rarely sufficient, and therefore techniques to achieve extended multivisceral resections are required. While aggressive resections offer the best opportunity for local control, palliation, and cure, they also carry a high risk of complications and long-term morbidity.

Metformin use and improved response to therapy in rectal cancer.,Cancer medicine,Cancer Med,2013-02-03,"Locally advanced rectal cancer is commonly treated with chemoradiation prior to total mesorectal excision (TME). Studies suggest that metformin may be an effective chemopreventive agent in this disease as well as a possible adjunct to current therapy. In this study, we examined the effect of metformin use on pathologic complete response (pCR) rates and outcomes in rectal cancer. The charts of 482 patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma treated from 1996 to 2009 with chemoradiation and TME were reviewed. Median radiation dose was 50.4 Gy (range 19.8-63). Nearly, all patients were treated with concurrent 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (98%) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (81.3%). Patients were categorized as nondiabetic (422), diabetic not taking metformin (40), or diabetic taking metformin (20). No significant differences between groups were found in clinical tumor classification, nodal classification, tumor distance from the anal verge or circumferential extent, pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen level, or pathologic differentiation. pCR rates were 16.6% for nondiabetics, 7.5% for diabetics not using metformin, and 35% for diabetics taking metformin, with metformin users having significantly higher pCR rates than either nondiabetics (P = 0.03) or diabetics not using metformin (P = 0.007). Metformin use was significantly associated with pCR rate on univariate (P = 0.05) and multivariate (P = 0.01) analyses. Furthermore, patients taking metformin had significantly increased disease-free (P = 0.013) and overall survival (P = 0.008) compared with other diabetic patients.

PET with 62Cu-ATSM and 62Cu-PTSM is a useful imaging tool for hypoxia and perfusion in pulmonary lesions.,AJR. American journal of roentgenology,AJR Am J Roentgenol,2013-11-01,"Hypoxia is a characteristic of many tumors and portends a worse prognosis in lung, cervical, prostate, and rectal cancers. Unlike the others, lung cancers present a unique challenge in measuring hypoxia, with invasive biopsies and higher rates of complications. Noninvasive imaging studies detecting hypoxia using isotopes of copper-diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) ((62)Cu-ATSM) have predicted prognosis and treatment outcomes in some small feasibility trials. These images, however, may not identify all areas of hypoxia. Hence, we hypothesize that the addition of another PET imaging agent, copper-pyruvaldehyde-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) ((62)Cu-PTSM), which can detect areas of perfusion, can augment the information obtained in (62)Cu-ATSM PET scans. To characterize tumors on the basis of both perfusion and hypoxia, 10 patients were studied using both (62)Cu-ATSM and (62)Cu-PTSM PET scans. In addition, proteomic arrays looking at specific proangiogenic, survival, and proinflammatory targets were assessed. Six of 10 patients had evaluable PET scans. Our initial experience of characterizing lung tumor hypoxia using (62)Cu-ATSM and (62)Cu-PTSM PET scans showed that visualization of areas with hypoxia normalized for perfusion is feasible. All studied tumors exhibited some hypoxia. Despite the small sample size, a positive relationship was noted between epidermal growth factor levels and (62)Cu-ATSM-detected hypoxia. This initial series of (62)Cu-ATSM and (62)Cu-PTSM PET scans shows that evaluating lung masses by visualizing hypoxia and perfusion is a feasible and novel technique to provide more information. Further investigation is warranted to assess the potential role of (62)Cu-ATSM and (62)Cu-PTSM PET techniques combined with proteomics as alternatives to invasive biopsy techniques in clinical care.",Journal Article,2272.0,12.0,Hypoxia is a characteristic of many tumors and portends a worse prognosis in and cancers Unlike the others cancers present a unique challenge in measuring hypoxia with invasive biopsies and higher rates of complications Noninvasive imaging studies detecting hypoxia using isotopes of copper-diacetyl-bis N4-methylthiosemicarbazone 62 Cu-ATSM have predicted prognosis and treatment outcomes in some small feasibility trials These images however may not identify all areas of hypoxia Hence we hypothesize that the addition of another PET imaging agent copper-pyruvaldehyde-bis N4-methylthiosemicarbazone 62 Cu-PTSM which can detect areas of perfusion can augment the information obtained in 62 Cu-ATSM PET scans To characterize tumors on the basis of both perfusion and hypoxia 10 patients were studied using both 62 Cu-ATSM and 62 Cu-PTSM PET scans In addition proteomic arrays looking at specific proangiogenic survival and proinflammatory targets were assessed Six of 10 patients had evaluable PET scans Our initial experience of characterizing tumor hypoxia using 62 Cu-ATSM and 62 Cu-PTSM PET scans showed that visualization of areas with hypoxia normalized for perfusion is feasible All studied tumors exhibited some hypoxia Despite the small sample size a positive relationship was noted between epidermal growth factor levels and 62 Cu-ATSM-detected hypoxia This initial series of 62 Cu-ATSM and 62 Cu-PTSM PET scans shows that evaluating masses by visualizing hypoxia and perfusion is a feasible and novel technique to provide more information Further investigation is warranted to assess the potential role of 62 Cu-ATSM and 62 Cu-PTSM PET techniques combined with proteomics as alternatives to invasive biopsy techniques in clinical care,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,"[1823, 16, 8, 2037, 1, 445, 57, 2, 8745, 8, 639, 356, 4, 2, 163, 4246, 3, 1749, 163, 364, 8, 991, 1745, 4, 2978, 1823, 5, 416, 1154, 2, 142, 151, 1, 521, 2957, 270, 94, 2502, 1823, 75, 16210, 1, 10289, 48014, 7200, 33541, 40518, 744, 6119, 22818, 47, 783, 356, 2, 24, 123, 4, 476, 302, 1437, 143, 46, 1572, 137, 68, 44, 255, 62, 1361, 1, 1823, 3665, 21, 4919, 17, 3, 352, 1, 1809, 495, 270, 420, 10289, 63543, 7200, 33541, 40518, 744, 6119, 32198, 92, 122, 1426, 1361, 1, 3018, 122, 4369, 3, 487, 683, 4, 744, 6119, 22818, 495, 1441, 6, 1507, 57, 23, 3, 877, 1, 110, 3018, 2, 1823, 79, 7, 11, 656, 75, 110, 744, 6119, 22818, 2, 744, 6119, 32198, 495, 1441, 4, 352, 3784, 3923, 9095, 28, 112, 8571, 25, 2, 5767, 637, 11, 275, 437, 1, 79, 7, 42, 859, 495, 1441, 114, 388, 730, 1, 5723, 30, 1823, 75, 744, 6119, 22818, 2, 744, 6119, 32198, 495, 1441, 224, 17, 6234, 1, 1361, 5, 1823, 4207, 9, 3018, 16, 1313, 62, 656, 57, 1416, 476, 1823, 550, 3, 302, 1000, 444, 8, 109, 858, 10, 1051, 59, 829, 129, 161, 148, 2, 744, 6119, 22818, 530, 1823, 26, 388, 988, 1, 744, 6119, 22818, 2, 744, 6119, 32198, 495, 1441, 1949, 17, 1435, 2692, 20, 21396, 1823, 2, 3018, 16, 8, 1313, 2, 229, 1312, 6, 377, 80, 487, 195, 940, 16, 1197, 6, 423, 3, 174, 200, 1, 744, 6119, 22818, 2, 744, 6119, 32198, 495, 1092, 397, 5, 6478, 22, 6295, 6, 416, 411, 1092, 4, 38, 165]",1746.0,24147499,325
Impact of chemotherapy on normal tissue complication probability models of acute hematologic toxicity in patients receiving pelvic intensity modulated radiation therapy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2013-10-22,"To determine how chemotherapy agents affect radiation dose parameters that correlate with acute hematologic toxicity (HT) in patients treated with pelvic intensity modulated radiation therapy (P-IMRT) and concurrent chemotherapy. We assessed HT in 141 patients who received P-IMRT for anal, gynecologic, rectal, or prostate cancers, 95 of whom received concurrent chemotherapy. Patients were separated into 4 groups: mitomycin (MMC) + 5-fluorouracil (5FU, 37 of 141), platinum ± 5FU (Cis, 32 of 141), 5FU (26 of 141), and P-IMRT alone (46 of 141). The pelvic bone was contoured as a surrogate for pelvic bone marrow (PBM) and divided into subsites: ilium, lower pelvis, and lumbosacral spine (LSS). The volumes of each region receiving 5-40 Gy were calculated. The endpoint for HT was grade ≥3 (HT3+) leukopenia, neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Normal tissue complication probability was calculated using the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman model. Logistic regression was used to analyze association between HT3+ and dosimetric parameters. Twenty-six patients experienced HT3+: 10 of 37 (27%) MMC, 14 of 32 (44%) Cis, 2 of 26 (8%) 5FU, and 0 of 46 P-IMRT. PBM dosimetric parameters were correlated with HT3+ in the MMC group but not in the Cis group. LSS dosimetric parameters were well correlated with HT3+ in both the MMC and Cis groups. Constrained optimization (0<n≤ 1) of the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman model resulted in n=1, m = 0.11, TD50 = 31 Gy for LSS in the MMC group and n=1, m = 0.27, TD50 = 35 Gy for LSS in the Cis group.

Secular trends in colon and rectal cancer relative survival.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2013-10-30,"Treatment options for colorectal cancer (CRC) have improved substantially over the past 25 years. Measuring the impact of these improvements on survival outcomes is challenging, however, against the background of overall survival gains from advancements in the prevention, screening, and treatment of other conditions. Relative survival is a metric that accounts for these concurrent changes, allowing assessment of changes in CRC survival. We describe stage- and location-specific trends in relative survival after CRC diagnosis. We analyzed survival outcomes for 233965 people in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program who were diagnosed with CRC between January 1, 1975, and December 31, 2003. All models were adjusted for sex, race (black vs white), age at diagnosis, time since diagnosis, and diagnosis year. We estimated the proportional difference in survival for CRC patients compared with overall survival for age-, sex-, race-, and period-matched controls to account for concurrent changes in overall survival using two-sided Wald tests. We found statistically significant reductions in excess hazard of mortality from CRC in 2003 relative to 1975, with excess hazard ratios ranging from 0.75 (stage IV colon cancer; P < .001) to 0.32 (stage I rectal cancer; P < .001), indicating improvements in relative survival for all stages and cancer locations. These improvements occurred in earlier years for patients diagnosed with stage I cancers, with smaller but continuing improvements for later-stage cancers. Our results demonstrate a steady trend toward improved relative survival for CRC, indicating that treatment and surveillance improvements have had an impact at the population level.",Journal Article,2274.0,34.0,Treatment options for cancer CRC have improved substantially over the past 25 years Measuring the impact of these improvements on survival outcomes is challenging however against the background of overall survival gains from advancements in the prevention screening and treatment of other conditions Relative survival is a metric that accounts for these concurrent changes allowing assessment of changes in CRC survival We describe stage- and location-specific trends in relative survival after CRC diagnosis We analyzed survival outcomes for 233965 people in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER program who were diagnosed with CRC between January 1 1975 and December 31 2003 All models were adjusted for sex race black vs white age at diagnosis time since diagnosis and diagnosis year We estimated the proportional difference in survival for CRC patients compared with overall survival for age- sex- race- and period-matched controls to account for concurrent changes in overall survival using two-sided Wald tests We found statistically significant reductions in excess hazard of mortality from CRC in 2003 relative to 1975 with excess hazard ratios ranging from 0.75 stage IV cancer P .001 to 0.32 stage I cancer P .001 indicating improvements in relative survival for all stages and cancer locations These improvements occurred in earlier years for patients diagnosed with stage I cancers with smaller but continuing improvements for later-stage cancers Our results demonstrate a steady trend toward improved relative survival for CRC indicating that treatment and surveillance improvements have had an impact at the population level,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[24, 838, 9, 12, 590, 47, 231, 2109, 252, 3, 1219, 243, 60, 2978, 3, 345, 1, 46, 1474, 23, 25, 123, 16, 1950, 137, 480, 3, 2426, 1, 63, 25, 3849, 29, 6217, 4, 3, 1070, 453, 2, 24, 1, 127, 1298, 580, 25, 16, 8, 6515, 17, 4162, 9, 46, 750, 400, 2952, 455, 1, 400, 4, 590, 25, 21, 897, 82, 2, 1147, 112, 1963, 4, 580, 25, 50, 590, 147, 21, 311, 25, 123, 9, 63569, 3788, 4, 3, 617, 1284, 2, 396, 99, 1605, 1243, 54, 11, 265, 5, 590, 59, 1024, 14, 7585, 2, 1397, 456, 1522, 62, 274, 11, 586, 9, 1035, 1047, 1445, 105, 886, 89, 28, 147, 98, 1192, 147, 2, 147, 111, 21, 661, 3, 831, 523, 4, 25, 9, 590, 7, 72, 5, 63, 25, 9, 89, 1035, 1047, 2, 727, 655, 535, 6, 1967, 9, 750, 400, 4, 63, 25, 75, 100, 1689, 16721, 895, 21, 204, 712, 93, 2153, 4, 2612, 360, 1, 282, 29, 590, 4, 1522, 580, 6, 7585, 5, 2612, 360, 1137, 2223, 29, 13, 481, 82, 478, 12, 19, 144, 6, 13, 531, 82, 70, 12, 19, 144, 1716, 1474, 4, 580, 25, 9, 62, 1153, 2, 12, 4069, 46, 1474, 489, 4, 1677, 60, 9, 7, 265, 5, 82, 70, 163, 5, 2170, 84, 4346, 1474, 9, 1559, 82, 163, 114, 99, 608, 8, 4152, 853, 1317, 231, 580, 25, 9, 590, 1716, 17, 24, 2, 617, 1474, 47, 42, 35, 345, 28, 3, 266, 301]",1652.0,24174654,2

We reviewed records from 26 patients who had CT imaging during ICBT for International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IB2-IVA cervical cancer. Using α/β=10, we calculated hypothetical nominal doses to achieve a biologically effective dose at 2 Gy per fraction (EQD2α/β=10) of 40 Gy to Point A for high-dose-rate ICBT with 1-15 fractions. Corresponding minimum EQD2α/β=3s to the maximally irradiated 2 cc of rectum, bladder, and sigmoid were calculated for each fractionation scheme and added to EQD2α/β=3 from external beam radiotherapy. Total EQD2α/β=3s were compared with American Brachytherapy Society suggested dose constraints (rectum/sigmoid, ≤75 Gy; bladder, ≤90 Gy). Except for rectal EQD2α/β=3 in three patients, the rectal, bladder, and sigmoid EQD2α/β=3s decreased with increasing fractionation in all patients. Although the total rectal EQD2α/β=3s were less than the American Brachytherapy Society rectal dose constraint in all patients at all fractionation schedules, the total bladder EQD2α/β=3s routinely exceeded the bladder dose constraint, even at maximum fractionation. By contrast, increasing fractionation decreased the number of patients with doses exceeding the sigmoid dose constraint by 48%. The relationship between ICBT fractionation schedule and relative EQD2α/β=3s to rectum, bladder, and sigmoid depends on individual anatomy.

Patients with clinical stage II to III rectal adenocarcinoma, within 12 cm from the anal verge, were treated in 4 escalating dose levels, using the continual reassessment method. Patients received preoperative radiation therapy with concurrent bevacizumab (5 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks), erlotinib, and capecitabine. Capecitabine dose was increased from 650 mg/m(2) to 825 mg/m(2) orally twice daily on the days of radiation therapy; erlotinib dose was increased from 50 mg orally daily in weeks 1 to 3, to 50 mg daily in weeks 1 to 6, to 100 mg daily in weeks 1 to 6. Patients underwent surgery at least 9 weeks after the last dose of bevacizumab. A total of 19 patients were enrolled, and 18 patients were considered evaluable. No patient had grade 4 acute toxicity, and 1 patient had grade 3 acute toxicity (hypertension). The MTD was not reached. All 18 evaluable patients underwent surgery, with low anterior resection in 7 (39%), proctectomy with coloanal anastomosis in 4 patients (22%), posterior pelvic exenteration in 1 (6%), and abdominoperineal resection in 6 (33%). Of the 18 patients, 8 (44%) had pathologic complete response, and 1 had complete response of the primary tumor with positive nodes.

We aimed to identify small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) that synergize with ionizing radiation (IR) (""radiosensitizers"") that could be incorporated into current treatment strategies for locally advanced rectal cancers (LARCs) expressing mutant K-RAS. We first optimized a high-throughput assay for measuring individual and combined effects of SMIs and IR that produces similar results to the gold standard colony formation assay. Using this screening platform and K-RAS mutant rectal cancer cell lines, we tested SMIs targeting diverse signaling pathways for radiosensitizing activity and then evaluated our top hits in follow-up experiments. The two most potent radiosensitizers were the Chk1/2 inhibitor AZD7762 and the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235. The chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which is used to treat LARC, synergized with AZD7762 and enhanced radiosensitization by AZD7762. This study is the first to compare different SMIs in combination with IR for the treatment of K-RAS mutant rectal cancer, and our findings suggest that Chk1/2 inhibitors should be evaluated in new clinical trials for LARC.

A watch-and-wait approach to the management of rectal cancer.,"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)","Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",2013-10-01,"There has been increasing interest in whether a watch-and-wait strategy can be pursued instead of routine surgery in selected rectal cancer patients who have a clinical complete response (cCR) after chemoradiation. The watch-and-wait approach could potentially reduce treatment-related toxicity in selected rectal cancer patients. A large study from Brazil and a prospective trial from the Netherlands appear to support this approach, although multiple other studies have raised concerns about the high rate of local recurrence with this strategy. This article reviews current evidence in support of a watch-and-wait approach to rectal cancer management, and discusses the challenges and limitations of this approach. Among these are the facts that current methods of assessing tumor response have limited accuracy, and that a cCR does not necessarily imply pathologic complete response. Careful patient selection and systematic methods of response assessment and follow-up will be critical to the success of nonoperative approaches.

The influence of complications on the costs of complex cancer surgery.,Cancer,Cancer,2013-12-30,"It is widely known that outcomes after cancer surgery vary widely, depending on interactions between patient, tumor, neoadjuvant therapy, and provider factors. Within this complex milieu, the influence of complications on the cost of surgical oncology care remains unknown. The authors examined rates of Patient Safety Indicator (PSI) occurrence for 6 cancer operations and their association with costs of care. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) PSI definitions were used to identify patient safety-related complications in Medicare claims data. Hospital and inpatient physician claims for the years 2005 through 2009 were analyzed for 6 cancer resections: colectomy, rectal resection, pulmonary lobectomy, pneumonectomy, esophagectomy, and pancreatic resection. Risk-adjusted regression analyses were used to measure the association between each PSI and hospitalization costs. Overall PSI rates ranged from a low of 0.01% for postoperative hip fracture to a high of 2.58% for respiratory failure. Death among inpatients with serious treatable complications, postoperative respiratory failure, postoperative thromboembolism, and accidental puncture/laceration were >1% for all 6 cancer operations. Several PSIs-including decubitus ulcer, death among surgical inpatients with serious treatable complications, and postoperative thromboembolism-raised hospitalization costs by ≥20% for most cancer surgery types.

The increasing incidence of young-onset colorectal cancer: a call to action.,Mayo Clinic proceedings,Mayo Clin. Proc.,2014-01-04,"In the United States, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common and second most lethal cancer. More than one-tenth of CRC cases (11% of colon cancers and 18% of rectal cancers) have a young onset (ie, occurring in individuals younger than 50 years). The CRC incidence and mortality rates are decreasing among all age groups older than 50 years, yet increasing in younger individuals for whom screening use is limited and key symptoms may go unrecognized. Familial syndromes account for approximately 20% of young-onset CRCs, and the remainder are typically microsatellite stable cancers, which are more commonly diploid than similar tumors in older individuals. Young-onset CRCs are more likely to occur in the distal colon or rectum, be poorly differentiated, have mucinous and signet ring features, and present at advanced stages. Yet, stage-specific survival in patients with young-onset CRC is comparable to that of patients with later-onset cancer. Primary care physicians have an important opportunity to identify high-risk young individuals for screening and to promptly evaluate CRC symptoms. Risk modification, targeted screening, and prophylactic surgery may benefit individuals with a predisposing hereditary syndrome or condition (eg, inflammatory bowel disease) or a family history of CRC or advanced adenomatous polyps.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy without routine use of radiation therapy for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer: a pilot trial.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2014-01-13,"Although neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy achieves low local recurrence rates in clinical stages II to III rectal cancer, it delays administration of optimal chemotherapy. We evaluated preoperative infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX)/bevacizumab with selective rather than consistent use of chemoradiotherapy. Thirty-two patients with clinical stages II to III rectal cancer participated in this single-center phase II trial. All were candidates for low anterior resection with total mesorectal excision (TME). Patients were to receive six cycles of FOLFOX, with bevacizumab included for cycles 1 to 4. Patients with stable/progressive disease were to have radiation before TME, whereas responders were to have immediate TME. Postoperative radiation was planned if R0 resection was not achieved. Postoperative FOLFOX × 6 was recommended, but adjuvant regimens were left to clinician discretion. The primary outcome was R0 resection rate. Between April 2007 and December 2008, 32 (100%) of 32 study participants had R0 resections. Two did not complete preoperative chemotherapy secondary to cardiovascular toxicity. Both had preoperative chemoradiotherapy and then R0 resections. Of 30 patients completing preoperative chemotherapy, all had tumor regression and TME without preoperative chemoradiotherapy. The pathologic complete response rate to chemotherapy alone was 8 of 32 (25%; 95% CI, 11% to 43%). The 4-year local recurrence rate was 0% (95% CI, 0% to 11%); the 4-year disease-free survival was 84% (95% CI, 67% to 94%). For selected patients with clinical stages II to III rectal cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy and selective radiation does not seem to compromise outcomes.

Significant variation exists in the receipt of postoperative chemotherapy after resection in this population. The objective of this study was to determine the demographic and clinicopathologic factors associated with the initiation of postoperative chemotherapy in elderly patients with rectal cancer and to identify potential targets for reducing treatment variation. A retrospective cohort study was performed of patients with rectal cancer ages 66 to 80 years who received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and underwent radical resection in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-linked Medicare database (1998-2007). Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess chemotherapy use in relation to patient, tumor, and treatment response characteristics. Among 1492 patients who met the study criteria, 61.5% received adjuvant therapy with 5-fluorouracil. Pathologic stage was the strongest determinant of whether patients received postoperative chemotherapy (48.3% of patients with stage I disease, 59.6% of patients with stage II disease, and 77.6% of patients with stage III disease). Increasing age and postoperative readmission also were associated significantly with a decreased rate of adjuvant therapy initiation.

Mutational analysis and clinical correlation of metastatic colorectal cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2014-02-05,"Early identification of mutations may guide patients with metastatic colorectal cancer toward targeted therapies that may be life prolonging. The authors assessed tumor genotype correlations with clinical characteristics to determine whether mutational profiling can account for clinical similarities, differences, and outcomes. Under Institutional Review Board approval, 222 patients with metastatic colon adenocarcinoma (n = 158) and rectal adenocarcinoma (n = 64) who underwent clinical tumor genotyping were reviewed. Multiplexed tumor genotyping screened for >150 mutations across 15 commonly mutated cancer genes. The chi-square test was used to assess genotype frequency by tumor site and additional clinical characteristics. Cox multivariate analysis was used to assess the impact of genotype on overall survival. Broad-based tumor genotyping revealed clinical and anatomic differences that could be linked to gene mutations. NRAS mutations were associated with rectal cancer versus colon cancer (12.5% vs 0.6%; P < .001) and with age ≥56 years (7% vs 0.9%; P = .02). Conversely, v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) mutations were associated with colon cancer (13% vs 3%; P = .024) and older age (15.8% vs 4.6%; P = .006).

Neoadjuvant radiotherapy use in locally advanced rectal cancer at NCCN member institutions.,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,2014-02-01,"Based on randomized data, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has been incorporated into the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for stage II-III rectal cancer. Factors associated with nonadherence to evidence-based guidelines for neoadjuvant radiotherapy (RT) were examined at dedicated cancer centers. The prospective NCCN Oncology Outcomes Database for Colorectal Cancers was queried for patients with stage II-III rectal cancer who underwent a transabdominal surgical resection between September 2005 and June 2012. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with omission of RT. Among 1199 identified patients, 1119 (93%) received neoadjuvant RT, 51 (4%) did not receive RT, and 29 (2%) received adjuvant RT. Among 51 patients not receiving RT, only 19 (37%) were referred and evaluated by a radiation oncologist. On multivariable analysis, clinical factors associated with not receiving RT included a history of prior pelvic RT (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 23.9; P=.0003), ECOG performance status of 2 or greater (aOR, 11.1; P=.01), tumor distance from the anal verge greater than 10 cm (aOR, 5.4; P=.009), age at diagnosis of 75 years or older (aOR, 4.43; P=.002), body mass index of 25 to 30 kg/m(2) and less than 25 kg/m(2) (aOR, 5.22 and 4.23, respectively; P=.03), and clinical stage II (aOR, 2.27; P=.02). No significant change was seen in RT use according to diagnosis year, nor was any correlation seen with distance to the nearest RT facility. Concordance with NCCN Guidelines for neoadjuvant RT is high among NCCN Member Institutions. After adjusting for clinical characteristics that increase the risk for RT toxicity, including history of pelvic RT and high comorbidity burden/low functional status, the authors found that non-obese patients of advanced age or those with more favorable clinical features were more likely to not receive RT.

Early-stage rectal cancer: clinical and pathologic prognostic markers of time to local recurrence and overall survival after resection.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2014-04-01,"Resection without adjuvant therapy results in a low recurrence rate for patients with stage I (T1/2 N0) rectal cancer in the range of 4% to 16% at 5 years. There are limited data, however, regarding clinical or pathologic prognostic markers for recurrence in this population. The aim of this study is to assess the clinical and pathologic factors associated with local recurrence and overall survival in patients with early-stage rectal cancer after resection. This is a retrospective study. This study was conducted at 2 tertiary care centers in Boston, Massachusetts. From 2000 to 2008, 175 patients with stage I rectal cancer treated with local or total mesorectal excision without adjuvant therapy were identified. Time to local recurrence after resection and overall survival were evaluated for all patients with complete follow-up data. Perioperative data were reviewed to identify staging method, preoperative CEA, type of surgery, tumor size, number of lymph nodes resected, histological grade, circumferential resection margin, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and tumor ulceration. Data were analyzed by using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Of the eligible cohort, 137 patients had complete follow-up data for analysis of time to local recurrence, and only 23 (16.8%) patients had local recurrence. Among these 23 patients, the median time to recurrence was 1.1 years (0.1-7.8). On multivariate analysis, male sex, current alcohol use, and tumor ulceration were associated with heightened risk of local recurrence. Of the original cohort, 173 patients had complete follow-up for overall survival analysis. Among these patients, the median overall survival was 12 years. On multivariable analysis, age at diagnosis >65 years and T2 pathologic stage were associated with decreased survival. As in any retrospective study, there is a potential for selection bias. Several patients were excluded from the analysis due to inadequate follow-up data. These results from two academic medical centers with specialized colorectal surgeons may not be generally applicable. The relatively small number of events, ie, recurrences, suggest the findings should be validated in a larger study. For patients with stage I rectal cancer treated with resection alone, these results provide important prognostic information and may help identify those who could benefit from additional therapy.",Evaluation Study,2121.0,20.0,Resection without adjuvant therapy results in a low recurrence rate for patients with stage I T1/2 N0 cancer in the range of 4 to 16 at 5 years There are limited data however regarding clinical or pathologic prognostic markers for recurrence in this population The aim of this study is to assess the clinical and pathologic factors associated with local recurrence and overall survival in patients with early-stage cancer after resection This is a retrospective study This study was conducted at 2 tertiary care centers in Boston Massachusetts From 2000 to 2008 175 patients with stage I cancer treated with local or total mesorectal excision without adjuvant therapy were identified Time to local recurrence after resection and overall survival were evaluated for all patients with complete follow-up data Perioperative data were reviewed to identify staging method preoperative CEA type of surgery tumor size number of lymph nodes resected histological grade circumferential resection margin perineural invasion lymphovascular invasion and tumor ulceration Data were analyzed by using a Cox proportional hazards regression model Of the eligible cohort 137 patients had complete follow-up data for analysis of time to local recurrence and only 23 16.8 patients had local recurrence Among these 23 patients the median time to recurrence was 1.1 years 0.1-7.8 On multivariate analysis male sex current alcohol use and tumor ulceration were associated with heightened risk of local recurrence Of the original cohort 173 patients had complete follow-up for overall survival analysis Among these patients the median overall survival was 12 years On multivariable analysis age at diagnosis 65 years and T2 pathologic stage were associated with decreased survival As in any retrospective study there is a potential for selection bias Several patients were excluded from the analysis due to inadequate follow-up data These results from two academic medical centers with specialized surgeons may not be generally applicable The relatively small number of events ie recurrences suggest the findings should be validated in a larger study For patients with stage I cancer treated with resection alone these results provide important prognostic information and may help identify those who could benefit from additional therapy,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[170, 187, 249, 36, 99, 4, 8, 154, 146, 116, 9, 7, 5, 82, 70, 1534, 18, 3394, 12, 4, 3, 184, 1, 39, 6, 245, 28, 33, 60, 125, 32, 383, 74, 137, 666, 38, 15, 510, 177, 525, 9, 146, 4, 26, 266, 3, 1130, 1, 26, 45, 16, 6, 423, 3, 38, 2, 510, 130, 41, 5, 293, 146, 2, 63, 25, 4, 7, 5, 191, 82, 12, 50, 170, 26, 16, 8, 459, 45, 26, 45, 10, 426, 28, 18, 2557, 165, 1168, 4, 7026, 5459, 29, 1081, 6, 1375, 3300, 7, 5, 82, 70, 12, 73, 5, 293, 15, 181, 5823, 1366, 187, 249, 36, 11, 108, 98, 6, 293, 146, 50, 170, 2, 63, 25, 11, 194, 9, 62, 7, 5, 236, 166, 126, 74, 1547, 74, 11, 446, 6, 255, 632, 596, 498, 3088, 267, 1, 152, 30, 444, 207, 1, 263, 502, 1133, 1831, 88, 7937, 170, 959, 4917, 578, 2933, 578, 2, 30, 5158, 74, 11, 311, 20, 75, 8, 418, 831, 1017, 320, 202, 1, 3, 625, 180, 4352, 7, 42, 236, 166, 126, 74, 9, 65, 1, 98, 6, 293, 146, 2, 158, 382, 245, 66, 7, 42, 293, 146, 107, 46, 382, 7, 3, 52, 98, 6, 146, 10, 14, 14, 60, 13, 14, 67, 66, 23, 331, 65, 1045, 1035, 291, 2197, 119, 2, 30, 5158, 11, 41, 5, 7145, 43, 1, 293, 146, 1, 3, 2279, 180, 5785, 7, 42, 236, 166, 126, 9, 63, 25, 65, 107, 46, 7, 3, 52, 63, 25, 10, 133, 60, 23, 658, 65, 89, 28, 147, 556, 60, 2, 1786, 510, 82, 11, 41, 5, 340, 25, 22, 4, 500, 459, 45, 125, 16, 8, 174, 9, 881, 2947, 392, 7, 11, 1800, 29, 3, 65, 520, 6, 3358, 166, 126, 74, 46, 99, 29, 100, 1916, 484, 1168, 5, 4791, 1613, 68, 44, 40, 1228, 3801, 3, 1352, 302, 207, 1, 281, 2523, 1593, 309, 3, 272, 257, 40, 938, 4, 8, 1077, 45, 9, 7, 5, 82, 70, 12, 73, 5, 170, 279, 46, 99, 377, 305, 177, 487, 2, 68, 987, 255, 135, 54, 359, 247, 29, 402, 36]",2314.0,24608301,183
Placement of empty catheters for an HDR-emulating LDR prostate brachytherapy technique: comparison to standard intraoperative planning.,Brachytherapy,Brachytherapy,2014-03-05,"We sought to determine whether placing empty catheters within the prostate and then inverse planning iodine-125 seed locations within those catheters (High Dose Rate-Emulating Low Dose Rate Prostate Brachytherapy [HELP] technique) would improve concordance between planned and achieved dosimetry compared with a standard intraoperative technique. We examined 30 consecutive low dose rate prostate cases performed by standard intraoperative technique of planning followed by needle placement/seed deposition and compared them to 30 consecutive low dose rate prostate cases performed by the HELP technique. The primary endpoint was concordance between planned percentage of the clinical target volume that receives at least 100% of the prescribed dose/dose that covers 90% of the volume of the clinical target volume (V100/D90) and the actual V100/D90 achieved at Postoperative Day 1. The HELP technique had superior concordance between the planned target dosimetry and what was actually achieved at Day 1 and Day 30. Specifically, target D90 at Day 1 was on average 33.7 Gy less than planned for the standard intraoperative technique but was only 10.5 Gy less than planned for the HELP technique (p < 0.001). Day 30 values were 16.6 Gy less vs. 2.2 Gy more than planned, respectively (p = 0.028). Day 1 target V100 was 6.3% less than planned with standard vs. 2.8% less for HELP (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the urethral and rectal concordance (all p > 0.05).

Risk of late toxicity in men receiving dose-escalated hypofractionated intensity modulated prostate radiation therapy: results from a randomized trial.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2014-04-01,"To report late toxicity outcomes from a randomized trial comparing conventional and hypofractionated prostate radiation therapy and to identify dosimetric and clinical parameters associated with late toxicity after hypofractionated treatment. Men with localized prostate cancer were enrolled in a trial that randomized men to either conventionally fractionated intensity modulated radiation therapy (CIMRT, 75.6 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions) or to dose-escalated hypofractionated IMRT (HIMRT, 72 Gy in 2.4-Gy fractions). Late (≥90 days after completion of radiation therapy) genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity were prospectively evaluated and scored according to modified Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. 101 men received CIMRT and 102 men received HIMRT. The median age was 68, and the median follow-up time was 6.0 years. Twenty-eight percent had low-risk, 71% had intermediate-risk, and 1% had high-risk disease. There was no difference in late GU toxicity in men treated with CIMRT and HIMRT. The actuarial 5-year grade ≥2 GU toxicity was 16.5% after CIMRT and 15.8% after HIMRT (P=.97). There was a nonsignificant numeric increase in late GI toxicity in men treated with HIMRT compared with men treated with CIMRT. The actuarial 5-year grade ≥2 GI toxicity was 5.1% after CIMRT and 10.0% after HIMRT (P=.11). In men receiving HIMRT, the proportion of rectum receiving 36.9 Gy, 46.2 Gy, 64.6 Gy, and 73.9 Gy was associated with the development of late GI toxicity (P<.05). The 5-year actuarial grade ≥2 GI toxicity was 27.3% in men with R64.6Gy ≥ 20% but only 6.0% in men with R64.6Gy < 20% (P=.016). Dose-escalated IMRT using a moderate hypofractionation regimen (72 Gy in 2.4-Gy fractions) can be delivered safely with limited grade 2 or 3 late toxicity.

"Feasibility, efficacy, and adverse effects of outpatient antibacterial prophylaxis in children with acute myeloid leukemia.",Cancer,Cancer,2014-03-26,"Intensive chemotherapy for pediatric acute myeloid leukemia incurs the risk of infectious complications, but the benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis remain unclear. In the current study, among 103 children treated on the AML02 protocol between October 2002 and October 2008 at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, the authors retrospectively assessed the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on the frequency of febrile neutropenia, clinically or microbiologically confirmed infections (including bacteremia), and antibiotic resistance, as well as on the results of nasal and rectal surveillance cultures. Initially, patients received no prophylaxis or oral cephalosporin (group A). The protocol was then amended to administer intravenous cefepime alone or intravenous vancomycin plus either oral cephalosporin, oral ciprofloxacin, or intravenous cefepime (group B). There were 334 infectious episodes. Patients in group A had a significantly greater frequency of documented infections and bacteremia (both P < .0001) (including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteremia; P = .0003 and .001, respectively) compared with patients in group B, especially viridans streptococcal bacteremia (P = .001). The incidence of febrile neutropenia without documented infection was not found to be different between the 2 groups. Five cases of bacteremia with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) occurred in group B (vs none in group A), without related mortality. Two of these cases were preceded by positive VRE rectal surveillance cultures.

Cancer,2014-04-15,"The association between fish, ω-3 and ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake and risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains inconclusive. Recent prospective studies suggest that the relationship may vary by gender, subsite and duration of follow-up. We followed 123,529 US adults (76,386 women and 47,143 men) without a history of cancer at baseline for 24 to 26 years. Fish and PUFA intake was assessed at baseline and updated every 4 years by using a validated food-frequency questionnaire. We found no overall association between fish, ω-3 and ω-6 PUFA intake and CRC risk with hazard ratio (HR) of 1.03 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89-1.20] comparing marine ω-3 intake of ≥ 0.30 g/d versus <0.15 g/d among women and 1.05 (95% CI: 0.85-1.30) comparing intake of ≥ 0.41 g/d versus <0.16 g/d among men. However, fish and marine ω-3 PUFA intake appeared to be positively associated with risk of distal colon cancer in both men and women and inversely with risk of rectal cancer in men. In an analysis based on a limited number of cases, marine ω-3 PUFA intake assessed 12-16 years before diagnosis tended to be inversely associated with CRC risk in men (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.52-1.10).

"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy first, followed by chemoradiation and then surgery, in the management of locally advanced rectal cancer.",Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,2014-04-01,"Standard therapy for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) is preoperative chemoradiotherapy and postoperative chemotherapy. At Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) the authors began offering FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) as initial treatment for patients with high-risk LARC to target micrometastases while treating the primary tumor. The purpose of this study is to report the safety and efficacy of initial FOLFOX given before chemoradiotherapy on tumor downsizing and pathologic complete response (pathCR) in LARC. The records of patients with stage II/III rectal cancer treated at MSKCC between 2007 and 2012 were reviewed. Of approximately 300 patients with LARC treated at MSKCC, 61 received FOLFOX as initial therapy. Of these 61 patients, 57 received induction FOLFOX (median 7 cycles) followed by chemoradiation, and 4 experienced an excellent response, declined chemoradiation, and underwent total mesorectal excision (TME). Twelve of the 61 patients did not undergo TME: 9 had a complete clinical response (CCR), 1 declined despite persistent tumor, 1 declined because of comorbidities, and 1 developed metastatic disease. Among the 61 patients receiving initial FOLFOX, 22 (36%) had either a pathCR (n=13) or a CCR (n=9). Of the 49 patients who underwent TME, all had R0 resections and 23 (47%) had tumor response greater than 90%, including 13 (27%) who experienced a pathCR. Of the 28 patients who received all 8 cycles of FOLFOX, 8 experienced a pathCR (29%) and 3 a CCR (11%). No serious adverse events occurred that required a delay in treatment during FOLFOX or chemoradiation. FOLFOX and chemoradiation before planned TME results in tumor regression, a high rate of delivery of planned therapy, and a substantial rate of pathCRs, and offers a good platform for nonoperative management in select patients.

Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked data, we identified 4959 patients older than 65 y with stage I-III rectal cancer diagnosed from 2000-2005 who underwent operative intervention at one of 370 hospitals. We evaluated the distribution of hospital-specific procedure rates and used generalized mixed models with random hospital effects to examine the influence of patient characteristics and hospital on operation type, using APR as a reference. The median hospital performed APR on 33% of elderly patients with rectal cancer. Hospital was a stronger predictor of LAR receipt than any patient characteristic, explaining 32% of procedure choice, but not a strong predictor of LE, explaining only 3.8%. Receipt of LE was primarily related to tumor size and tumor stage, which combined explained 31% of procedure variation. Receipt of LE is primarily determined by patient characteristics.

Patients with clinical stage II or III rectal cancer who were undergoing preoperative RT (45 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks plus a boost of 5.4 Gy to 10.8 Gy in three to six daily fractions) were randomly assigned to one of the following chemotherapy regimens: continuous intravenous infusional fluorouracil (CVI FU; 225 mg/m(2), 5 days per week), with or without intravenous oxaliplatin (50 mg/m(2) once per week for 5 weeks) or oral capecitabine (825 mg/m(2) twice per day, 5 days per week), with or without oxaliplatin (50 mg/m(2) once per week for 5 weeks). Before random assignment, the surgeon indicated whether the patient was eligible for sphincter-sparing surgery based on clinical staging. The surgical end points were complete pathologic response (pCR), sphincter-sparing surgery, and surgical downstaging (conversion to sphincter-sparing surgery). From September 2004 to August 2010, 1,608 patients were randomly assigned. No significant differences in the rates of pCR, sphincter-sparing surgery, or surgical downstaging were identified between the CVI FU and capecitabine regimens or between the two regimens with or without oxaliplatin. Patients treated with oxaliplatin experienced significantly more grade 3 or 4 diarrhea (P < .001). Administering capecitabine with preoperative RT achieved similar rates of pCR, sphincter-sparing surgery, and surgical downstaging compared with CVI FU. Adding oxaliplatin did not improve surgical outcomes but added significant toxicity.

"Analyses of clinicopathological, molecular, and prognostic associations of KRAS codon 61 and codon 146 mutations in colorectal cancer: cohort study and literature review.",Molecular cancer,Mol. Cancer,2014-05-31,"KRAS mutations in codons 12 and 13 are established predictive biomarkers for anti-EGFR therapy in colorectal cancer. Previous studies suggest that KRAS codon 61 and 146 mutations may also predict resistance to anti-EGFR therapy in colorectal cancer. However, clinicopathological, molecular, and prognostic features of colorectal carcinoma with KRAS codon 61 or 146 mutation remain unclear. We utilized a molecular pathological epidemiology database of 1267 colon and rectal cancers in the Nurse's Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. We examined KRAS mutations in codons 12, 13, 61 and 146 (assessed by pyrosequencing), in relation to clinicopathological features, and tumor molecular markers, including BRAF and PIK3CA mutations, CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), LINE-1 methylation, and microsatellite instability (MSI). Survival analyses were performed in 1067 BRAF-wild-type cancers to avoid confounding by BRAF mutation. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compute mortality hazard ratio, adjusting for potential confounders, including disease stage, PIK3CA mutation, CIMP, LINE-1 hypomethylation, and MSI. KRAS codon 61 mutations were detected in 19 cases (1.5%), and codon 146 mutations in 40 cases (3.2%). Overall KRAS mutation prevalence in colorectal cancers was 40% (=505/1267). Of interest, compared to KRAS-wild-type, overall, KRAS-mutated cancers more frequently exhibited cecal location (24% vs. 12% in KRAS-wild-type; P < 0.0001), CIMP-low (49% vs. 32% in KRAS-wild-type; P < 0.0001), and PIK3CA mutations (24% vs. 11% in KRAS-wild-type; P < 0.0001). These trends were evident irrespective of mutated codon, though statistical power was limited for codon 61 mutants.

The visual analog scale (VAS) and modified standard gamble (SG) were used to elicit preferences of women with no evidence of disease after primary treatment of cervical cancer. Higher scores on VAS and SG indicated more favorable ratings for a given health state. Health states (HS) included vaginal shortening, diarrhea, dietary changes, menopause, moderate nausea/vomiting, rectal bleeding, sexual dysfunction, and urinary self-catheterization. Descriptive statistics, Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, and Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests and correlation coefficients were used for statistical analysis. Seventy-eight patients participated in the study. Median age was 44.1 years (range, 24.9-67.8 years). Median time since treatment completion was 31.2 months (range, 1.0-113.3 months). The HSs rated as most favorable by VAS were also rated as most favorable by SG. Increasing age was associated with higher VAS scores for menopause and vaginal shortening (P = 0.04 and 0.036). African Americans had higher VAS scores for dietary changes (P = 0.05), sexual dysfunction (P = 0.028), and diarrhea (P = 0.05) when compared with Hispanic and non-Hispanic white patients. Women receiving radiation had more favorable VAS scores for menopause compared with women undergoing radical hysterectomy (P = 0.05). Women receiving chemotherapy rated urinary self-catheterization less favorably by VAS score compared with those not receiving chemotherapy (P = 0.045).

Progress and opportunities in molecular pathological epidemiology of colorectal premalignant lesions.,The American journal of gastroenterology,Am. J. Gastroenterol.,2014-06-17,"Molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE) is an integrative molecular and population health science that addresses the molecular pathogenesis and heterogeneity of disease processes. The MPE of colonic and rectal premalignant lesions (including hyperplastic polyps, tubular adenomas, tubulovillous adenomas, villous adenomas, traditional serrated adenomas, sessile serrated adenomas/sessile serrated polyps, and hamartomatous polyps) can provide unique opportunities for examining the influence of diet, lifestyle, and environmental exposures on specific pathways of carcinogenesis. Colorectal neoplasia can provide a practical model by which both malignant epithelial tumor (carcinoma) and its precursor are subjected to molecular pathological analyses. KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA oncogene mutations, microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, and LINE-1 methylation are commonly examined tumor biomarkers. Future opportunities include interrogation of comprehensive genomic, epigenomic, or panomic datasets, and the adoption of in vivo pathology techniques. Considering the colorectal continuum hypothesis and emerging roles of gut microbiota and host immunity in tumorigenesis, detailed information on tumor location is important. There are unique strengths and caveats, especially with regard to case ascertainment by colonoscopy.

The impact of stool and gas volume on intrafraction prostate motion in patients undergoing radiotherapy with daily endorectal balloon.,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,Radiother Oncol,2014-07-11,"The aim of this study was to quantify the impact of rectal stool/gas volumes on intrafraction prostate motion for patients undergoing prostate radiotherapy with daily endorectal balloon (ERB). Total and anterior stool/gas rectal volumes were quantified in 30 patients treated with daily ERB. Real-time intrafraction prostate motion from 494 treatment sessions, at most 6 min in length, was evaluated using Calypso(®) tracking system. The deviation of prostate intrafraction motion distribution was a function of stool/gas volume, especially when stool/gas is located in the anterior part of the rectum. Compared to patients with small anterior stool/gas volumes (<10 cm(3)), those with large volume (10-60 cm(3)) had a twofold increase in 3D prostate motion and interquartile data range within the 6th minute of treatment time. The 10% of the overall CBCT session where large anterior rectal volumes were observed demonstrated larger percentage of time at displacement greater than our proposed internal margin 3 mm. Volume and location of stool/gas can directly impact the ERB's intrafraction immobilization ability.

"SMO expression in colorectal cancer: associations with clinical, pathological, and molecular features.",Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2014-07-15,"Smoothened, frizzled family receptor (SMO) is an important component of the hedgehog signaling pathway, which has been implicated in various human carcinomas. However, clinical, molecular, and prognostic associations of SMO expression in colorectal cancer remain unclear. Using a database of 735 colon and rectal cancers in the Nurse's Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, we examined the relationship of tumor SMO expression (assessed by immunohistochemistry) to prognosis, and to clinical, pathological, and tumor molecular features, including mutations of KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA, microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), LINE-1 methylation, and expression of phosphorylated AKT and CTNNB1. SMO expression was detected in 370 tumors (50 %). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, SMO expression was independently inversely associated with phosphorylated AKT expression [odds ratio (OR) 0.48; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.34-0.67] and CTNNB1 nuclear localization (OR 0.48; 95 % CI 0.35-0.67).

Polymorphisms in folate-metabolizing enzymes and response to 5-fluorouracil among patients with stage II or III rectal cancer (INT-0144; SWOG 9304).,Cancer,Cancer,2014-07-15,"Recurrence and toxicity occur commonly among patients with rectal cancer who are treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The authors hypothesized that genetic variation in folate-metabolizing genes could play a role in interindividual variability. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the associations between genetic variants in folate-metabolizing genes and clinical outcomes among patients with rectal cancer treated with 5-FU. The authors investigated 8 functionally significant polymorphisms in 6 genes (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase [MTHFR] [C677T, A1298C], SLC19A1 [G80A], SHMT1 [C1420T], dihydrofolate reductase [DHFR] [Del19bp], TS 1494del,and TSER) involved in folate metabolism in 745 patients with TNM stage II or III rectal cancer enrolled in a phase 3 adjuvant clinical trial of 3 regimens of 5-FU and radiotherapy (INT-0144 and SWOG 9304). There were no statistically significant associations noted between polymorphisms in any of the genes and overall survival, disease-free survival (DFS), and toxicity in the overall analyses. Nevertheless, there was a trend toward worse DFS among patients with the variant allele of MTHFR C677T compared with wild-type, particularly in treatment arm 2, in which patients with the MTHFR C677T TT genotype had worse overall survival (hazards ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-2.93 [P = .03]) and DFS (hazards ratio, 1.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-3.03 [P = .02]) compared with those with homozygous wild-type. In addition, there was a trend toward reduced hematological toxicity among patients with variants of SLC19A1 G80A in treatment arm 1 (P for trend, .06) and reduced esophagitis/stomatitis noted among patients with variants of TSER in treatment arm 3 (P for trend, .06).

Antiretroviral-free HIV-1 remission and viral rebound after allogeneic stem cell transplantation: report of 2 cases.,Annals of internal medicine,Ann. Intern.

To characterize HIV-1 reservoirs in blood and tissues and perform analytic antiretroviral treatment interruptions to determine the potential for allogeneic HSCT to lead to sustained, antiretroviral-free HIV-1 remission. Case report with characterization of HIV-1 reservoirs and immunity before and after antiretroviral interruption. Tertiary care center. Two men with HIV with undetectable HIV-1 after allogeneic HSCT for hematologic tumors. Quantification of HIV-1 in various tissues after HSCT and the duration of antiretroviral-free HIV-1 remission after treatment interruption. No HIV-1 was detected from peripheral blood or rectal mucosa before analytic treatment interruption. Plasma HIV-1 RNA and cell-associated HIV-1 DNA remained undetectable until 12 and 32 weeks after antiretroviral cessation. Both patients experienced rebound viremia within 2 weeks of the most recent negative viral load measurement and developed symptoms consistent with the acute retroviral syndrome. One patient developed new efavirenz resistance after reinitiation of antiretroviral therapy. Reinitiation of active therapy led to viral decay and resolution of symptoms in both patients. The study involved only 2 patients. Allogeneic HSCT may lead to loss of detectable HIV-1 from blood and gut tissue and variable periods of antiretroviral-free HIV-1 remission, but viral rebound can occur despite a minimum 3-log10 reduction in reservoir size. Long-lived tissue reservoirs may have contributed to viral persistence.

Risk-adjusted pathologic margin positivity rate as a quality indicator in rectal cancer surgery.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2014-09-01,"Margin positivity after rectal cancer resection is associated with poorer outcomes. We previously developed an instrument for calculating hospital risk-adjusted margin positivity rate (RAMP) that allows identification of performance-based outliers and may represent a rectal cancer surgery quality metric. This was an observational cohort study of patients with rectal cancer within the National Cancer Data Base (2003 to 2005). Hospital performance was categorized as low outlier (better than expected), high outlier (worse than expected), or non-RAMP outlier using standard observed-to-expected methodology. The association between outlier status and overall risk of death at 5 years was evaluated using Cox shared frailty modeling. Among 32,354 patients with cancer (mean age, 63.8 +/-13.2 years; 56.7% male; 87.3% white) treated at 1,349 hospitals (4.9% high outlier, 0.7% low outlier), 5.6% of patients were treated at high outliers and 3.0% were treated at low outliers. Various structural (academic status and volume), process (pathologic nodal evaluation and neoadjuvant radiation therapy use), and outcome (sphincter preservation, readmission, and 30-day postoperative mortality) measures were significantly associated with outlier status. Five-year overall survival was better at low outliers (79.9%) compared with high outliers (64.9%) and nonoutliers (68.9%; log-rank test, P < .001).

"Failure of evidence-based cancer care in the United States: the association between rectal cancer treatment, cancer center volume, and geography.",Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2014-10-01,"This study examines recent adherence to recommended neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy guidelines for patients with rectal cancer across geographic regions and institution volume and assesses trends over time. A recent report by the Institute of Medicine described US cancer care as chaotic. Cited deficiencies included wide variation in adherence to evidence-based guidelines even where clear consensus exists. Patients operated on for clinical stage II and III rectal cancer were selected from the 2006-2011 National Cancer Data Base. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to assess variation in chemotherapy and radiation use by cancer center type, geographical location, and hospital volume. The analysis controlled for patient age at diagnosis, sex, race/ethnicity, primary payer, average household income, average education, urban/rural classification of patient residence, comorbidity, and oncologic stage. There were 30,994 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Use of neoadjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy varied significantly by type of cancer center. The highest rates of adherence were observed in high-volume centers compared with low-volume centers (78% vs 69%; adjusted odds ratio = 1.46; P < 0.001). This variation is mirrored by hospital geographic location. Primary payer and year of diagnosis were not predictive of rates of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Adherence to evidence-based treatment guidelines in rectal cancer is suboptimal in the United States, with significant differences based on hospital volume and geographic regions. Little improvement has occurred in the last 5 years. These results support the implementation of standardized care pathways and a Centers of Excellence program for US patients with rectal cancer.",Journal Article,1938.0,70.0,"This study examines recent adherence to recommended neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy guidelines for patients with cancer across geographic regions and institution volume and assesses trends over time A recent report by the Institute of Medicine described US cancer care as chaotic Cited deficiencies included wide variation in adherence to evidence-based guidelines even where clear consensus exists Patients operated on for clinical stage II and III cancer were selected from the 2006-2011 National Cancer Data Base Multivariable logistic regressions were used to assess variation in chemotherapy and radiation use by cancer center type geographical location and hospital volume The analysis controlled for patient age at diagnosis sex race/ethnicity primary payer average household income average education urban/rural classification of patient residence comorbidity and oncologic stage There were 30,994 patients who met the inclusion criteria Use of neoadjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy varied significantly by type of cancer center The highest rates of adherence were observed in high-volume centers compared with low-volume centers 78 vs 69 adjusted odds ratio 1.46 P 0.001 This variation is mirrored by hospital geographic location Primary payer and year of diagnosis were not predictive of rates of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy Adherence to evidence-based treatment guidelines in cancer is suboptimal in the United States with significant differences based on hospital volume and geographic regions Little improvement has occurred in the last 5 years These results support the implementation of standardized care pathways and a Centers of Excellence program for US patients with cancer",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[26, 45, 4468, 435, 2149, 6, 793, 536, 1464, 677, 9, 7, 5, 12, 716, 3466, 1374, 2, 731, 433, 2, 7777, 1963, 252, 98, 8, 435, 414, 20, 3, 1377, 1, 1807, 1027, 843, 12, 165, 22, 43427, 7068, 7159, 159, 1019, 1380, 4, 2149, 6, 241, 90, 677, 871, 1257, 885, 1391, 2481, 7, 7297, 23, 9, 38, 82, 215, 2, 316, 12, 11, 715, 29, 3, 1324, 1132, 657, 12, 74, 1782, 658, 812, 5142, 11, 95, 6, 423, 1380, 4, 56, 2, 121, 119, 20, 12, 574, 267, 8767, 1147, 2, 702, 433, 3, 65, 1149, 9, 69, 89, 28, 147, 1035, 1047, 2091, 86, 7433, 1011, 7353, 2306, 1011, 1848, 5532, 5291, 947, 1, 69, 5562, 1879, 2, 1998, 82, 125, 11, 201, 17830, 7, 54, 543, 3, 1680, 371, 119, 1, 536, 121, 36, 2, 56, 2051, 97, 20, 267, 1, 12, 574, 3, 1076, 151, 1, 2149, 11, 164, 4, 64, 433, 1168, 72, 5, 154, 433, 1168, 833, 105, 790, 586, 610, 197, 14, 641, 19, 13, 144, 26, 1380, 16, 12304, 20, 702, 3466, 1147, 86, 7433, 2, 111, 1, 147, 11, 44, 464, 1, 151, 1, 536, 1464, 2149, 6, 241, 90, 24, 677, 4, 12, 16, 3291, 4, 3, 1088, 907, 5, 93, 362, 90, 23, 702, 433, 2, 3466, 1374, 1215, 767, 71, 489, 4, 3, 1060, 33, 60, 46, 99, 538, 3, 2393, 1, 1670, 165, 460, 2, 8, 1168, 1, 11473, 1243, 9, 843, 7, 5, 12]",1701.0,25203879,126

We reviewed the clinical histories and pathology of four patients with GI PBL at our institute and similar case reports published in peer-reviewed journals. In our first case, a 40 year-old human immunodeficiency virus positive male presented with a hemorrhoid-like sensation, and was diagnosed with PBL via biopsy of a rectal mass. The second case involves a 65 year-old healthy male with bloody diarrhea who was found to have PBL in a resected sigmoid mass. The third patient was a 41 year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease who presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. A small intestinal mass (PBL) was removed. The fourth patient was a 65-year-old male who was found PBL after surgical resection of bowel for his florid Crohn's disease. He later developed secondary acute myeloid leukemia. Clinical outcome was very poor in 3 out of 4 patients as reported in the literature. One patient survived chemotherapy followed by autologous transplant.

Retrospective analysis of 18F-FDG PET/CT for staging asymptomatic breast cancer patients younger than 40 years.,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",J. Nucl. Med.,2014-09-11,"National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines consider (18)F-FDG PET/CT for only clinical stage III breast cancer patients. However, there is debate whether TNM staging should be the only factor in considering if PET/CT is warranted. Patient age may be an additional consideration, because young breast cancer patients often have more aggressive tumors with potential for earlier metastases. This study assessed PET/CT for staging of asymptomatic breast cancer patients younger than 40 y. In this Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective study, our hospital information system was screened for breast cancer patients younger than 40 y who underwent staging PET/CT before any treatment. Patients with symptoms or conventional imaging findings suggestive of distant metastases or with prior malignancy were excluded. Initial stage was based on physical examination, mammography, ultrasound, and breast MR imaging. PET/CT was then evaluated to identify unsuspected extraaxillary regional nodal and distant metastases. One hundred thirty-four patients with initial breast cancer stage I to IIIC met inclusion criteria. PET/CT findings led to upstaging to stage III or IV in 28 patients (21%). Unsuspected extraaxillary regional nodes were found in 15 of 134 patients (11%) and distant metastases in 20 of 134 (15%), with 7 of 134 (5%) demonstrating both. PET/CT revealed stage IV disease in 1 of 20 (5%) patients with initial clinical stage I, 2 of 44 (5%) stage IIA, 8 of 47 (17%) stage IIB, 4 of 13 (31%) stage IIIA, 4 of 8 (50%) stage IIIB, and 1 of 2 (50%) stage IIIC. All 20 patients upstaged to stage IV were histologically confirmed. Four synchronous thyroid and 1 rectal malignancies were identified.

The association between delayed and incomplete chemotherapy was assessed using unconditional and conditional logistic regressions.

Comparison of tumor regression grade systems for locally advanced rectal cancer after multimodality treatment.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2014-09-22,"Tumor regression grade (TRG) is a measure of histopathological response of rectal cancer to neoadjuvant chemoradiation and is associated with outcomes. Several TRG systems are used: Mandard (5,3-tier), Dowrak/Rödel (5,3-tier), Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging. A single measure of rectal cancer response would assist in comparing results across institutions, and in designing future rectal cancer studies. In this study, the predictive accuracies of the various published classification schemes are compared. Review of a prospective database identified 563 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (T3/4 and/or N1) treated between 1998 and 2007 with long-course chemoradiation and total mesorectal excision. TRG was determined by measuring proportion of tumor mass replaced by fibrosis. Patients were classified into TRG schemes, which were compared by analyzing association with recurrence and survival using concordance index. Probabilities of recurrence-free survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. All statistical tests were two-sided. All TRG systems were predictive of recurrence. Concordance indices of the three-tier Mandard, three-tier Dowrak/Rödel, three-tier MSKCC, and four-tier AJCC systems were: 0.665, 0.653, 0.683, and 0.694, respectively (higher number = better prediction). The AJCC system more accurately predicted recurrence than the three-tier Mandard (P = .002) or Dowrak/Rödel (P = .006) and had a higher concordance index than MSKCC, although this did not reach statistical significance (P = .068).

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® rectal cancer: metastatic disease at presentation.,"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)","Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",2014-10-01,"The management of rectal cancer in patients with metastatic disease at presentation is highly variable. There are no phase III trials addressing therapeutic approaches, and the optimal sequencing of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery remains unresolved. Although chemoradiation is standard for patients with stage II/III rectal cancer, its role in the metastatic setting is controversial. Omitting chemoradiation may not be appropriate in all stage IV patients, particularly those with symptomatic primary tumors. Moreover, outcomes in this setting are vastly different, as some treatments carry the potential for cure in selected patients, while others are purely palliative. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 3 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel.

Resection of colorectal liver metastases (CLM) may benefit patients with synchronous lung metastases even when lung metastases are not resected.

We compared survival among 98 patients who underwent resection of CLM with unresected lung metastases, 64 who received only chemotherapy for limited colorectal liver and lung metastases, and 41 who underwent resection of both liver and lung metastases. Prognostic factors were investigated in the patients who underwent resection of CLM only. The 3-year/5-year overall survival (OS) rates of patients with CLM resection only (42.9 %/13.1 %) were better than those of patients treated with chemotherapy only (14.1 %/1.6 %; p < 0.01) but worse than those of patients with resection of liver and lung metastases (68.9 %/56.9 %; p < 0.01).

BrUOG R-224 was designed to assess the impact of COmplete Neoadjuvant Treatment for REctal cancer (CONTRE), primary chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation and surgery, on treatment delivery, toxicities, and pathologic response at surgery. Patients with clinical stage II to III (T3 to T4 and/or N1 to N2) rectal cancer received 8 cycles of modified FOLFOX6 followed by capecitabine 825 mg/m bid concurrent with 50.4 Gy intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Surgery was performed 6 to 10 weeks after chemoradiation. Thirty-nine patients were enrolled between August 2010 and June 2013. Median age was 61 years (30 to 79 y); 7 patients (18%) were clinical stage II and 32 (82%) stage III. Thirty-six patients (92%) received all 8 cycles of mFOLFOX6, of whom 35 completed subsequent chemoradiation; thus 89% of patients received CONTRE as planned. No unexpected toxicities were reported.

"Alcohol, one-carbon nutrient intake, and risk of colorectal cancer according to tumor methylation level of IGF2 differentially methylated region.",The American journal of clinical nutrition,Am. J. Clin. Nutr.,2014-10-08,"Although a higher consumption of alcohol, which is a methyl-group antagonist, was previously associated with colorectal cancer risk, mechanisms remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that excess alcohol consumption might increase risk of colorectal carcinoma with hypomethylation of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) differentially methylated region-0 (DMR0), which was previously associated with a worse prognosis. With the use of a molecular pathologic epidemiology database in 2 prospective cohort studies, the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, we examined the association between alcohol intake and incident colorectal cancer according to the tumor methylation level of IGF2 DMR0. Duplication-method Cox proportional cause-specific hazards regression for competing risk data were used to compute HRs and 95% CIs. In addition, we investigated intakes of vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12, methionine, and folate as exposures. During 3,206,985 person-years of follow-up, we identified 993 rectal and colon cancer cases with an available tumor DNA methylation status. Compared with no alcohol consumption, the consumption of ≥15 g alcohol/d was associated with elevated risk of colorectal cancer with lower levels of IGF2 DMR0 methylation [within the first and second quartiles: HRs of 1.55 (95% CI: 1.08, 2.24) and 2.11 (95% CI: 1.44, 3.07), respectively]. By contrast, alcohol consumption was not associated with cancer with higher levels of IGF2 DMR0 methylation. The association between alcohol and cancer risk differed significantly by IGF2 DMR0 methylation level (P-heterogeneity = 0.006). The association of vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12, and folate intakes with cancer risk did not significantly differ according to IGF2 DMR0 methylation level (P-heterogeneity > 0.2). Higher alcohol consumption was associated with risk of colorectal cancer with IGF2 DMR0 hypomethylation but not risk of cancer with high-level IGF2 DMR0 methylation.

Role of microsatellite instability-low as a diagnostic biomarker of Lynch syndrome in colorectal cancer.,Cancer genetics,Cancer Genet,2014-10-13,"Lynch syndrome is the most common Mendelian disorder predisposing persons to hereditary colorectal cancer. Carriers of MSH6 mutations constitute less than 10% of the total of cases with Lynch syndrome and present with a weaker clinical phenotype, including low levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-L) in colorectal tumors. The frequency of MSH6 mutation carriers among patients presenting with MSI-L colorectal cancer has yet to be determined, as has the appropriate genetic workup in this context. We have reviewed here the clinicopathologic characteristics, immunohistochemistry, and genetic testing results for 71 patients at a single institution diagnosed with MSI-L colorectal cancers. Of 71 patients with MSI-L tumors, 21 underwent genetic testing for MSH6 mutations, three of whom presented with loss of staining of MSH6 and only one of whom carried a pathogenic germline MSH6 mutation in exon 4 (c.2677_2678delCT; p.Leu893Alafs*6). This latter patient had a significant family history of cancer and had a rectal primary tumor that showed instability only in mononucleotide markers. In this cohort of MSI-L patients, we detected no notable clinicopathologic or molecular characteristic that would help to distinguish a group most likely to harbor germline MSH6 mutations. Therefore, we conclude that the prevalence of MSH6 mutations among patients with MSI-L tumors is very low. Microsatellite instability analysis combined with immunohistochemistry of mismatch repair proteins adequately detects potential MSH6 mutation carriers among MSI-L colorectal cancers.

Low interrater reliability in grading of rectal bleeding using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Toxicity scales: a survey of radiation oncologists.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2014-10-13,"To measure concordance among genitourinary radiation oncologists in using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grading scales to grade rectal bleeding. From June 2013 to January 2014, a Web-based survey was sent to 250 American and Canadian academic radiation oncologists who treat prostate cancer. Participants were provided 4 case vignettes in which patients received radiation therapy and developed rectal bleeding and were asked for management plans and to rate the bleeding according to NCI CTC v.4 and RTOG late toxicity grading (scales provided). In 2 cases, participants were also asked whether they would send the patient for colonoscopy. A multilevel, random intercept modeling approach was used to assess sources of variation (case, respondent) in toxicity grading to calculate the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Agreement on a dichotomous grading scale (low grades 1-2 vs high grades 3-4) was also assessed, using the κ statistic for multiple respondents. Seventy-two radiation oncologists (28%) completed the survey. Forty-seven (65%) reported having either written or been principal investigator on a study using these scales. Agreement between respondents was moderate (ICC 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-0.58) when using NCI CTC and fair using the RTOG scale (ICC 0.28, 95% CI 0.20-0.40). Respondents who chose an invasive management were more likely to select a higher toxicity grade (P<.0001).

Impact of intrafraction and residual interfraction effect on prostate proton pencil beam scanning.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2014-10-13,"To quantitatively evaluate the impact of interplay effect and plan robustness associated with intrafraction and residual interfraction prostate motion for pencil beam scanning proton therapy. Ten prostate cancer patients with weekly verification CTs underwent pencil beam scanning with the bilateral single-field uniform dose (SFUD) modality. A typical field had 10-15 energy layers and 500-1000 spots. According to their treatment logs, each layer delivery time was <1 s, with average time to change layers of approximately 8 s. Real-time intrafraction prostate motion was determined from our previously reported prospective study using Calypso beacon transponders. Prostate motion and beam delivering sequence of the worst-case scenario patient were synchronized to calculate the ""true"" dose received by the prostate. The intrafraction effect was examined by applying the worst-case scenario prostate motion on the planning CT, and the residual interfraction effect was examined on the basis of weekly CT scans. The resultant dose variation of target and critical structures was examined to evaluate the interplay effect. The clinical target volume (CTV) coverage was degraded because of both effects. The CTV D99 (percentage dose to 99% of the CTV) varied up to 10% relative to the initial plan in individual fractions. However, over the entire course of treatment the total dose degradation of D99 was 2%-3%, with a standard deviation of <2%. Absolute differences between SFUD, intensity modulate proton therapy, and one-field-per-day SFUD plans were small. The intrafraction effect dominated over the residual interfraction effect for CTV coverage. Mean dose to the anterior rectal wall increased approximately 10% because of combined residual interfraction and intrafraction effects, the interfraction effect being dominant. Both intrafraction and residual interfraction prostate motion degrade CTV coverage within a clinically acceptable level. One-field-per-day SFUD delivered twice is as robust as the bilateral SFUD plan treated daily over the course of treatment.",Journal Article,1926.0,7.0,To quantitatively evaluate the impact of interplay effect and plan robustness associated with intrafraction and residual interfraction motion for pencil beam scanning proton therapy Ten cancer patients with weekly verification CTs underwent pencil beam scanning with the bilateral single-field uniform dose SFUD modality A typical field had 10-15 energy layers and 500-1000 spots According to their treatment logs each layer delivery time was 1 s with average time to change layers of approximately 8 s.

Incidence of minimally invasive colorectal cancer surgery at National Comprehensive Cancer Network centers.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2014-12-19,"Laparoscopic colectomy has been shown to have equivalent oncologic outcomes to open colectomy for the management of colon cancer, but its adoption nationally has been slow. This study investigates the prevalence and factors associated with laparoscopic colorectal resection at National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) centers. Data on patients undergoing surgery for colon and rectal cancer at NCCN centers from 2005 to 2010 were obtained from chart review of medical records for the NCCN Outcomes Project and included information on socioeconomic status, insurance coverage, comorbidity, and physician-reported Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. Associations between receipt of minimally invasive surgery and patient and clinical variables were analyzed with univariate and multivariable logistic regression. All statistical tests were two-sided. A total of 4032 patients, diagnosed between September 2005 and December 2010, underwent elective colon or rectal resection for cancer at NCCN centers. Median age of colon cancer patients was 62.6 years, and 49% were men. The percent of colon cancer patients treated with minimally invasive surgery (MIS) increased from 35% in 2006 to 51% in 2010 across all centers but varied statistically significantly between centers. On multivariable analysis, factors associated with minimally invasive surgery for colon cancer patients who had surgery at an NCCN institution were older age (P = .02), male sex (P = .006), fewer comorbidities (P ≤ .001), lower final T-stage (P < .001), median household income greater than or equal to $80000 (P < .001), ECOG performance status = 0 (P = .02), and NCCN institution (P ≤ .001).

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) at uncommon locations: a large population based analysis.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2015-01-05,"Sparse information is available about GISTs in uncommon locations. Our large database analysis aims to determine the characteristics of GISTs in the esophagus, colon and rectum and compare to gastric GISTs. The Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was queried from 1990 to 2009 using CS SCHEMA v0203. Characteristics of each location were compared to gastric GISTs. 4411 GIST (29 esophageal, 2658 stomach, 1463 small intestine, 126 colonic, and 135 rectal) from 1990 to 2009 were identified. Univariate and multivariate predictors of worse disease specific survival in both the entire cohort and surgical resection group include older age, male gender, tumor size > 5 cm, no surgical intervention and anatomical location. Although less likely to undergo surgical resection, esophageal GIST (all patients and resected) had a comparable survival to gastric GIST.

Does endoscopic ultrasound improve detection of locally recurrent anal squamous-cell cancer?,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2015-02-01,"Evaluating patients for recurrent anal cancer after primary treatment can be difficult owing to distorted anatomy and scarring. Many institutions incorporate endoscopic ultrasound to improve detection, but the effectiveness is unknown. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of digital rectal examination and endoscopic ultrasound in detecting locally recurrent disease during routine follow-up of patients with anal cancer. This study is a retrospective, single-institution review. This study was conducted at an oncologic tertiary referral center. Included were 175 patients with nonmetastatic anal squamous-cell cancer, without persistent disease after primary chemoradiotherapy, who had at least 1 posttreatment ultrasound and examination by a colorectal surgeon. The primary outcomes measured were the first modality to detect local recurrence, concordance, crude cancer detection rate, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value. Eight hundred fifty-five endoscopic ultrasounds and 873 digital rectal examinations were performed during 35 months median follow-up. Overall, ultrasound detected 7 (0.8%) mesorectal and 32 (3.7%) anal canal abnormalities; digital examination detected 69 (7.9%) anal canal abnormalities. Locally recurrent disease was found on biopsy in 8 patients, all detected first or only with digital examination. Four patients did not have an ultrasound at the time of diagnosis of recurrence. The concordance of ultrasound and digital examination in detecting recurrent disease was fair at 0.37 (SE, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.21-0.54), and there was no difference in crude cancer detection rate, sensitivity, specificity, and negative or positive predictive values. The heterogeneity of follow-up timing and examinations is not standardized in this study but is reflective of general practice. Endoscopic ultrasound did not provide any advantage over digital rectal examination in identifying locally recurrent anal cancer, and should not be recommended for routine surveillance.",Comparative Study,1815.0,6.0,Evaluating patients for recurrent cancer after primary treatment can be difficult owing to distorted anatomy and scarring Many institutions incorporate endoscopic ultrasound to improve detection but the effectiveness is unknown The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of digital examination and endoscopic ultrasound in detecting locally recurrent disease during routine follow-up of patients with cancer This study is a retrospective single-institution review This study was conducted at an oncologic tertiary referral center Included were 175 patients with nonmetastatic squamous-cell cancer without persistent disease after primary chemoradiotherapy who had at least 1 posttreatment ultrasound and examination by a surgeon The primary outcomes measured were the first modality to detect local recurrence concordance crude cancer detection rate sensitivity specificity and predictive value Eight hundred fifty-five endoscopic ultrasounds and 873 digital examinations were performed during 35 months median follow-up Overall ultrasound detected 7 0.8 mesorectal and 32 3.7 canal abnormalities digital examination detected 69 7.9 canal abnormalities Locally recurrent disease was found on biopsy in 8 patients all detected first or only with digital examination Four patients did not have an ultrasound at the time of diagnosis of recurrence The concordance of ultrasound and digital examination in detecting recurrent disease was fair at 0.37 SE 0.08 95 CI 0.21-0.54 and there was no difference in crude cancer detection rate sensitivity specificity and negative or positive predictive values The heterogeneity of follow-up timing and examinations is not standardized in this study but is reflective of general practice Endoscopic ultrasound did not provide any advantage over digital examination in identifying locally recurrent cancer and should not be recommended for routine surveillance,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[1435, 7, 9, 387, 12, 50, 86, 24, 122, 40, 1740, 3421, 6, 23534, 5081, 2, 13542, 445, 1764, 3360, 2056, 1945, 6, 401, 638, 84, 3, 1236, 16, 860, 3, 1130, 1, 26, 45, 16, 6, 932, 3, 1236, 1, 3271, 1385, 2, 2056, 1945, 4, 2502, 795, 387, 34, 190, 1311, 166, 126, 1, 7, 5, 12, 26, 45, 16, 8, 459, 226, 731, 206, 26, 45, 10, 426, 28, 35, 1998, 2557, 2096, 574, 159, 11, 3300, 7, 5, 2683, 691, 31, 12, 187, 1882, 34, 50, 86, 1464, 54, 42, 28, 506, 14, 3149, 1945, 2, 1385, 20, 8, 1897, 3, 86, 123, 644, 11, 3, 157, 1396, 6, 1426, 293, 146, 1827, 6622, 12, 638, 116, 485, 1121, 2, 464, 549, 659, 1128, 1461, 365, 2056, 16406, 2, 13388, 3271, 4209, 11, 173, 190, 465, 53, 52, 166, 126, 63, 1945, 530, 67, 13, 66, 5823, 2, 531, 27, 67, 5614, 1171, 3271, 1385, 530, 790, 67, 83, 5614, 1171, 795, 387, 34, 10, 204, 23, 411, 4, 66, 7, 62, 530, 157, 15, 158, 5, 3271, 1385, 294, 7, 205, 44, 47, 35, 1945, 28, 3, 98, 1, 147, 1, 146, 3, 1827, 1, 1945, 2, 3271, 1385, 4, 2502, 387, 34, 10, 7075, 28, 13, 567, 3428, 13, 1592, 48, 58, 13, 239, 13, 667, 2, 125, 10, 77, 523, 4, 6622, 12, 638, 116, 485, 1121, 2, 199, 15, 109, 464, 1030, 3, 1144, 1, 166, 126, 1972, 2, 4209, 16, 44, 1670, 4, 26, 45, 84, 16, 11834, 1, 1083, 758, 2056, 1945, 205, 44, 377, 500, 1874, 252, 3271, 1385, 4, 1386, 795, 387, 12, 2, 257, 44, 40, 793, 9, 1311, 617]",1906.0,25585077,85
"Time trend analysis of primary tumor resection for stage IV colorectal cancer: less surgery, improved survival.",JAMA surgery,JAMA Surg,2015-03-01,"With the advent of effective modern chemotherapeutic and biologic agents, primary tumor resection for patients with stage IV colorectal cancer (CRC) may not be routinely necessary. To evaluate the secular patterns of primary tumor resection use in stage IV CRC in the United States. A retrospective cohort study using data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results CRC registry. Demographic and clinical factors were compared for 64,157 patients diagnosed with stage IV colon or rectal cancer from January 1, 1988, through December 31, 2010, who had undergone primary tumor resection and those who had not. Rates of primary tumor resection and median relative survival were calculated for each year. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to determine when a significant change in trend in the primary tumor resection rate had occurred. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess factors associated with primary tumor resection. Difference in primary tumor resection rates over time. Of the 64,157 patients with stage IV CRC, 43,273 (67.4%) had undergone primary tumor resection. The annual rate of primary tumor resection decreased from 74.5% in 1988 to 57.4% in 2010 (P<.001), and a significant annual percentage change occurred between 1998-2001 and 2001-2010 (-0.41% vs -2.39%; P<.001). Factors associated with primary tumor resection were age younger than 50 years, female sex, being married, higher tumor grade, and presence of colon tumors. Median relative survival rate improved from 8.6% in 1988 to 17.8% in 2009 (P<.001); the annual percentage change was 2.18% in 1988-2001 and 5.43% in 1996-2009 (P<.001). The majority of patients with stage IV CRC had undergone primary tumor resection but, beginning in 2001, a trend toward fewer primary tumor resections was seen.

Pharmacogenetic Analysis of INT 0144 Trial: Association of Polymorphisms with Survival and Toxicity in Rectal Cancer Patients Treated with 5-FU and Radiation.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2015-01-14,"We tested whether 18 polymorphisms in 16 genes (GSTP1, COX2, IL10, EGFR, EGF, FGFR4, CCDN1, VEGFR2, VEGF, CXCR2, IL8, MMP3, ICAM1, ERCC1, RAD51, and XRCC3) would predict disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity in the INT0144 trial, which was designed to investigate different postoperative regimens of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemoradiation (CRT) in locally advanced rectal cancers: Arm 1 consisted of bolus 5-FU followed by 5-FU protracted venous infusion (PVI) with radiotherapy; arm 2 was induction and concomitant PVI 5-FU with radiotherapy and arm 3 was induction and concomitant bolus 5-FU with radiotherapy. DNA from 746 stage II/III rectal patients enrolled in the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) S9304 phase III trial was analyzed. Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue. The polymorphisms were analyzed using direct DNA-sequencing or polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). GSTP1-Ile105Val (rs1695) was significantly associated with DFS and OS and its effect did not vary by treatment arm. The five-year DFS and OS were 53% and 58%, respectively, for G/G, 66% and 72% for G/A, and 57% and 66% for A/A patients.

Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D and colorectal cancer risk according to tumour immunity status.,Gut,Gut,2015-01-15,"Evidence suggests protective effects of vitamin D and antitumour immunity on colorectal cancer risk. Immune cells in tumour microenvironment can convert 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] to bioactive 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, which influences neoplastic and immune cells as an autocrine and paracrine factor. Thus, we hypothesised that the inverse association between vitamin D and colorectal cancer risk might be stronger for cancers with high-level immune response than those with low-level immune response. We designed a nested case-control study (318 rectal and colon carcinoma cases and 624 matched controls) within the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study using molecular pathological epidemiology database. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to assess the association of plasma 25(OH)D with tumour subtypes according to the degree of lymphocytic reaction, tumour-infiltrating T cells (CD3+, CD8+, CD45RO+ (PTPRC) and FOXP3+ cells), microsatellite instability or CpG island methylator phenotype. The association of plasma 25(OH)D with colorectal carcinoma differed by the degree of intratumoural periglandular reaction (p for heterogeneity=0.001); high 25(OH)D was associated with lower risk of tumour with high-level reaction (comparing the highest versus lowest tertile: OR 0.10; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.35; p for trend<0.001), but not risk of tumour with lower-level reaction (p for trend>0.50). A statistically non-significant difference was observed for the associations of 25(OH)D with tumour subtypes according to CD3+ T cell density (p for heterogeneity=0.03; adjusted statistical significance level of α=0.006). High plasma 25(OH)D level is associated with lower risk of colorectal cancer with intense immune reaction, supporting a role of vitamin D in cancer immunoprevention through tumour-host interaction.",Journal Article,1832.0,53.0,"Evidence suggests protective effects of vitamin D and antitumour immunity on cancer risk Immune cells in tumour microenvironment can convert 25-hydroxyvitamin D 25 OH D to bioactive 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 which influences neoplastic and immune cells as an autocrine and paracrine factor Thus we hypothesised that the inverse association between vitamin D and cancer risk might be stronger for cancers with high-level immune response than those with low-level immune response We designed a nested case-control study 318 and carcinoma cases and 624 matched controls within the Nurses Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study using molecular pathological epidemiology database Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to assess the association of plasma 25 OH D with tumour subtypes according to the degree of lymphocytic reaction tumour-infiltrating T cells CD3+ CD8+ CD45RO+ PTPRC and FOXP3+ cells microsatellite instability or CpG island methylator phenotype The association of plasma 25 OH D with carcinoma differed by the degree of intratumoural periglandular reaction p for heterogeneity=0.001 high 25 OH D was associated with lower risk of tumour with high-level reaction comparing the highest versus lowest tertile OR 0.10 95 CI 0.03 to 0.35 p for trend 0.001 but not risk of tumour with lower-level reaction p for trend 0.50 A statistically non-significant difference was observed for the associations of 25 OH D with tumour subtypes according to CD3+ T cell density p for heterogeneity=0.03 adjusted statistical significance level of α=0.006 High plasma 25 OH D level is associated with lower risk of cancer with intense immune reaction supporting a role of vitamin D in cancer immunoprevention through tumour-host interaction",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[241, 844, 2864, 176, 1, 1610, 427, 2, 5282, 1604, 23, 12, 43, 250, 37, 4, 770, 995, 122, 10402, 243, 9761, 427, 243, 2912, 427, 6, 8186, 3305, 243, 11430, 6037, 92, 3859, 2000, 2, 250, 37, 22, 35, 5297, 2, 6012, 161, 631, 21, 11998, 17, 3, 2931, 248, 59, 1610, 427, 2, 12, 43, 822, 40, 3355, 9, 163, 5, 64, 301, 250, 51, 76, 135, 5, 154, 301, 250, 51, 21, 1114, 8, 4789, 473, 182, 45, 8797, 2, 134, 140, 2, 10999, 655, 535, 262, 3, 2707, 341, 45, 2, 341, 3409, 166, 126, 45, 75, 219, 1301, 1284, 609, 658, 3212, 812, 320, 10, 95, 6, 423, 3, 248, 1, 554, 243, 2912, 427, 5, 770, 814, 768, 6, 3, 1444, 1, 1193, 1329, 770, 2097, 102, 37, 3117, 968, 11469, 21632, 2, 3548, 37, 2226, 1753, 15, 2075, 3454, 5440, 1005, 3, 248, 1, 554, 243, 2912, 427, 5, 134, 2512, 20, 3, 1444, 1, 25668, 21582, 1329, 19, 9, 1144, 13, 144, 64, 243, 2912, 427, 10, 41, 5, 280, 43, 1, 770, 5, 64, 301, 1329, 1430, 3, 1076, 185, 2101, 6442, 15, 13, 79, 48, 58, 13, 680, 6, 13, 465, 19, 9, 853, 13, 144, 84, 44, 43, 1, 770, 5, 280, 301, 1329, 19, 9, 853, 13, 212, 8, 712, 220, 93, 523, 10, 164, 9, 3, 685, 1, 243, 2912, 427, 5, 770, 814, 768, 6, 3117, 102, 31, 1263, 19, 9, 1144, 13, 680, 586, 1050, 724, 301, 1, 2014, 13, 1861, 64, 554, 243, 2912, 427, 301, 16, 41, 5, 280, 43, 1, 12, 5, 3933, 250, 1329, 1912, 8, 200, 1, 1610, 427, 4, 12, 23738, 298, 770, 1204, 915]",1763.0,25591978,27

Does gadolinium-based contrast material improve diagnostic accuracy of local invasion in rectal cancer MRI? A multireader study.,AJR. American journal of roentgenology,AJR Am J Roentgenol,2015-02-01,"OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to compare reader accuracy and agreement on rectal MRI with and without gadolinium administration in the detection of T4 rectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS. In this study, two radiologists and one fellow independently interpreted all posttreatment MRI studies for patients with locally advanced or recurrent rectal cancer using unenhanced images alone or combined with contrast-enhanced images, with a minimum interval of 4 weeks. Readers evaluated involvement of surrounding structures on a 5-point scale and were blinded to pathology and disease stage. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, and AUC were calculated and kappa statistics were used to describe interreader agreement. RESULTS. Seventy-two patients (38 men and 34 women) with a mean age of 61 years (range, 32-86 years) were evaluated. Fifteen patients had 32 organs invaded. Global AUCs without and with gadolinium administration were 0.79 and 0.77, 0.91 and 0.86, and 0.83 and 0.78 for readers 1, 2, and 3, respectively. AUCs before and after gadolinium administration were similar. Kappa values before and after gadolinium administration for pairs of readers ranged from 0.5 to 0.7. CONCLUSION.

The rare BRAF VK600-601E mutation as a possible indicator of poor prognosis in rectal carcinoma – a report of a case.,BMC medical genetics,BMC Med. Genet.,2015-01-31,"The BRAF V600E mutation is reportedly associated with inferior survival among colon cancer patients. Here we report a patient with rectal cancer who carried the novel BRAF mutation VK600-601E, which has analogous molecular functions to those of the conventional BRAF mutation V600E, and may have potential as a prognostic marker for colorectal cancer (CRC). The present 65-year-old male patient was diagnosed with recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma (stage II by AJCC TNM staging 7th edition) 14 months after surgery and was treated with modified FOLFOX6 (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin), radiation, and FOLFIRI (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan).

Association of beclin 1 expression with response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy in patients with locally advanced rectal carcinoma.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2015-03-09,"Beclin 1 is an essential regulator of autophagy that is induced in response to cellular stress and serves to maintain cell survival in established tumors. We recently demonstrated that Beclin 1 suppression can sensitize colorectal cancer cells to radiation-induced DNA damage and apoptosis. Therefore, we hypothesized that the level of Beclin 1 expression may be associated with radiation sensitivity in vivo. We determined the association of Beclin 1 expression in pretreatment rectal cancer tissues with response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation in surgical resection specimens. Stages II and III (n = 96) rectal adenocarcinoma patients were treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgical resection with curative intent. Beclin 1 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and the expression level was dichotomized at the median value with categorization into low and high groups. We identified 56 (58.3%) and 40 (41.7%) patients whose tumors had high- versus low-level Beclin 1 expression, respectively. Rectal cancers with high versus low Beclin 1 expression were significantly less likely to be downstaged after chemoradiation treatment (45% [25/55] vs. 58% [22/38]; p = 0.02). In a multivariable analysis adjusted for age, sex, histological grade and baseline tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, the impact of Beclin 1 expression on tumor downstaging remained statistically significant (p = 0.03). The association of the level of Beclin 1 expression with the rate of tumor downstaging after chemoradiation is consistent with in vitro data, and suggests that Beclin 1 may be a predictive biomarker for the efficacy of chemoradiation in patients with rectal cancer.

An international randomised trial of celecoxib versus celecoxib plus difluoromethylornithine in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis.,Gut,Gut,2015-03-19,"Although Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce colorectal adenoma burden in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the utility of combining chemopreventive agents in FAP is not known. We conducted a randomised trial of celecoxib (CXB) versus CXB+diflouromethylornithine (DFMO) to determine the synergistic effect, if any. The primary endpoint was % change in adenoma count in a defined field. Secondary endpoints were adenoma burden (weighted by adenoma diameter) and video review of entire colon/rectal segments. Adverse event (AEs) were monitored by National Cancer Institution toxicity criteria. 112 subjects were randomised: 60 men and 52 women at a mean age of 38 years. For the 89 patients who had landmark-matched polyp counts available at baseline and 6 months, the mean % change in adenoma count over the 6 months of trial was -13.0% for CXB+DFMO and -1.0% for CXB (p=0.69). Mean % change in adenoma burden was -40% (CXB+DFMO) vs -27% (CXB) (p=0.13). Video-based global polyp change was -0.80 for CXB+DFMO vs -0.33 for CXB (p=0.03). Fatigue was the only significant AE, worse on the CXB arm (p=0.02). CXB combined with DFMO yielded moderate synergy according to a video-based global assessment. No significant difference in adenoma count, the primary endpoint, was seen between the two study arms. No evidence of DFMO-related ototoxicity was seen. There were no adverse cardiovascular outcomes in either trial arm and no significant increase in AEs in the CXB+DFMO arm of the trial.

Dose painting to treat single-lobe prostate cancer with hypofractionated high-dose radiation using targeted external beam radiation: Is it feasible?,Medical dosimetry : official journal of the American Association of Medical Dosimetrists,Med Dosim,2015-03-29,"Targeted focal therapy strategies for treating single-lobe prostate cancer are under investigation. In this planning study, we investigate the feasibility of treating a portion of the prostate to full-dose external beam radiation with reduced dose to the opposite lobe, compared with full-dose radiation delivered to the entire gland using hypofractionated radiation. For 10 consecutive patients with low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer, 2 hypofractionated, single-arc volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans were designed. The first plan (standard hypofractionation regimen [STD]) included the entire prostate gland, treated to 70 Gy delivered in 28 fractions. The second dose painting plan (DP) encompassed the involved lobe treated to 70 Gy delivered in 28 fractions, whereas the opposing, uninvolved lobe received 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. Mean dose to the opposing neurovascular bundle (NVB) was considerably lower for DP vs STD, with a mean dose of 53.9 vs 72.3 Gy (p < 0.001). Mean penile bulb dose was 18.6 Gy for DP vs 19.2 Gy for STD (p = 0.880). Mean rectal dose was 21.0 Gy for DP vs 22.8 Gy for STD (p = 0.356).

Differences Between Colon Cancer Primaries and Metastases Using a Molecular Assay for Tumor Radiation Sensitivity Suggest Implications for Potential Oligometastatic SBRT Patient Selection.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2015-03-30,"We previously developed a multigene expression model of tumor radiation sensitivity index (RSI) with clinical validation in multiple independent cohorts (breast, rectal, esophageal, and head and neck patients). The purpose of this study was to assess differences between RSI scores in primary colon cancer and metastases. Patients were identified from our institutional review board-approved prospective observational protocol. A total of 704 metastatic and 1362 primary lesions were obtained from a de-identified metadata pool. RSI was calculated using the previously published rank-based algorithm. An independent cohort of 29 lung or liver colon metastases treated with 60 Gy in 5 fractions stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) was used for validation. The most common sites of metastases included liver (n=374; 53%), lung (n=116; 17%), and lymph nodes (n=40; 6%). Sixty percent of metastatic tumors, compared with 54% of primaries, were in the RSI radiation-resistant peak, suggesting metastatic tumors may be slightly more radiation resistant than primaries (P=.01). In contrast, when we analyzed metastases based on anatomical site, we uncovered large differences in RSI. The median RSIs for metastases in descending order of radiation resistance were ovary (0.48), abdomen (0.47), liver (0.43), brain (0.42), lung (0.32), and lymph nodes (0.31) (P<.0001).

Baseline [(18)F]-FLT PET was collected prior to treatment initiation. Follow-up [(18)F]-FLT was collected after three weekly infusions of cetuximab, and following a combined regimen of cetuximab, 5-FU, and radiation. Imaging-matched biopsies were collected with each PET study. Diminished [(18)F]-FLT PET was observed in 3/4 of patients following cetuximab treatment alone and in all patients following combination therapy. Reduced [(18)F]-FLT PET following combination therapy predicted disease-free status at surgery. Overall, [(18)F]-FLT PET agreed with Ki67 immunoreactivity from biopsy samples and surgically resected tissue, and was predictive of treatment-induced rise in p27 levels.

"Using CBPR to Extend Prostate Cancer Education, Counseling, and Screening Opportunities to Urban-Dwelling African-Americans.",Journal of cancer education : the official journal of the American Association for Cancer Education,J Cancer Educ,2016-12-01,"Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is becoming one of the dominant approaches for bringing evidence- and consensus-based cancer prevention and control practices to medically underserved communities. There are many examples of how CBPR has been useful for generating culturally specific solutions for different health issues that affect African-Americans. However, few examples exist in the literature on how the CBPR approach can be applied to address prostate cancer. This paper describes a collaborative process for linking inner-city, African-American men to free prostate cancer education, physician counseling, and screening opportunities (prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and digital rectal examination (DRE)). The site of this community-based participatory project was the city of Buffalo, located in Erie County, New York. The collaborative, community-academic process that is described includes the following: (1) planning and conducting a community needs assessment to contextualize local prostate cancer issues, (2) organizing town and gown event planning, and (3) manipulating aspects of the built environment to build an infrastructure within the community to address disparities in screening opportunities.

MicroRNA-21 predicts response to preoperative chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer.,International journal of colorectal disease,Int J Colorectal Dis,2015-05-08,"The treatment of choice for locally advanced rectal cancer is preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Despite half of patients do not respond and suffer unnecessary toxicities and surgery delays, there are no biomarkers to guide preoperative CRT outcome. MicroRNA-21 has been related to acquisition of 5-fluorouracil resistance; however, its potential predictive value of response to preoperative chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer remains unknown. Nighty-two patients diagnosed with locally advanced rectal cancer who were preoperatively treated with chemoradiotherapy were selected for this study. Moreover, microRNA-21 expression was quantified in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsies from this cohort, and the results obtained were correlated with clinical and molecular characteristics, pathological response, and outcome. MicroRNA-21 was found overexpressed in 77.6% cases, and significantly correlated with tumor grade after preoperative chemoradiotherapy (P = 0.013) and with pathological response (P = 0.013).

Impact of Total Lymph Node Count on Staging and Survival After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation Therapy for Rectal Cancer.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2015-05-09,"Current guidelines recommend that a minimum of 12 lymph nodes (LNs) be dissected to accurately stage rectal cancer patients. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) decreases the number of LNs retrieved at surgery. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the number of LNs dissected on overall survival (OS) for localized rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant CRT. Treatment data were obtained on all patients treated for rectal cancer (2000-2013) in the National Oncology Data Alliance™, a proprietary database of merged tumor registries. Eligible patients were treated with neoadjuvant CRT followed by surgery and had complete data on number of positive LNs, number of LNs examined, and treatment dates (n = 4565). Hazard ratios for OS decreased sequentially with increasing number of LNs examined until a maximum benefit was achieved with examination of eight LNs.

Locally advanced rectal cancer: time for precision therapeutics.,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book. American Society of Clinical Oncology. Annual Meeting,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,2015-01-01,"The year 2015 marks the 30th anniversary of the publication of NSABP-R01, a landmark trial demonstrating the benefit of adding pelvic radiation to the treatment regimen for locally advanced rectal cancer with a resultant decrease in local recurrence from 25% to 16%. These results ushered in the era of multimodal therapy for rectal cancer, heralding modern treatment and changing the standard of care in the United States. We have seen many advances over the past 3 decades, including optimization of the administration and timing of radiation, widespread adoption of total mesorectal excision (TME), and the implementation of more effective systemic chemotherapy. The current standard is neoadjuvant chemoradiation with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and a radiosensitizer, TME, and adjuvant chemotherapy including 5-FU and oxaliplatin. The results of this regimen have been impressive, with a reported local recurrence rate of less than 10%. However, the rates of distant relapse remain 30% to 40%, indicating room for improvement. In addition, trimodality therapy is arduous and many patients are unable to complete the full course of treatment. In this article we discuss the current standard of care and alternative strategies that have evolved in an attempt to individualize therapy according to risk of recurrence.

Prognostic significance of clinical and pathological stages on locally advanced rectal carcinoma after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.,"Radiation oncology (London, England)",Radiat Oncol,2015-06-04,"To investigate prognostic significance of clinical and pathological stages in patients with locally advanced rectal carcinoma treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (neo-CRT) and total mesorectal excision. 210 patients with locally advanced rectal carcinoma (cT3-4 or cN+) treated with neo-CRT followed by total mesorectal excision. Treatment outcomes were compared according to clinical and pathological stage. Overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DFS) among patients with different clinical stage and pathological stage after neo-CRT. The median follow-up time was 47 months (range, 14-98 months). Clinical T stage was associated with 5 year OS (p = 0.042) and 5 year DFS (p = 0.014) while clinical N stage was not associated with 5 year OS (p = 0.440), 5 year DFS (p = 0.711).

J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2015-05-14,"To evaluate the rate of gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity of neoadjuvant chemoradiation with capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in cT3-4 rectal cancer. Patients with localized, nonmetastatic T3 or T4 rectal cancer <12 cm from the anal verge were enrolled in a prospective, multi-institutional, single-arm study of preoperative chemoradiation. Patients received 45 Gy with IMRT in 25 fractions, followed by a 3-dimensional conformal boost of 5.4 Gy in 3 fractions with concurrent capecitabine/oxaliplatin (CAPOX). Surgery was performed 4 to 8 weeks after the completion of therapy. Patients were recommended to receive FOLFOX chemotherapy after surgery. The primary endpoint of the study was acute grade 2 to 5 GI toxicity. Seventy-one patients provided 80% probability to detect at least a 12% reduction in the specified GI toxicity with the treatment of CAPOX and IMRT, at a significance level of .10 (1-sided). Seventy-nine patients were accrued, of whom 68 were evaluable. Sixty-one patients (89.7%) had cT3 disease, and 37 (54.4%) had cN (+) disease. Postoperative chemotherapy was given to 42 of 68 patients. Fifty-eight patients had target contours drawn per protocol, 5 patients with acceptable variation, and 5 patients with unacceptable variations. Thirty-five patients (51.5%) experienced grade ≥ 2 GI toxicity, 12 patients (17.6%) experienced grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, and pCR was achieved in 10 patients (14.7%).

Practice Guideline for the Surveillance of Patients After Curative Treatment of Colon and Rectal Cancer.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2015-08-01,"Current evidence suggests improved rates of curative secondary treatment following identification of recurrence among patients who participate in a surveillance program after initial curative resection of colon or rectal cancer. The newer data show that surveillance CEA, chest and liver imaging,and colonoscopy can also improve survival through early diagnosis of recurrence; thus, these modalities are now included in the current guideline. Although the optimum strategy of surveillance for office visits, CEA, chest and liver imaging, and colonoscopy is not yet defined, routine surveillance does improve the detection of recurrence that can be resected with curative intent. Recommended surveillance schedules are shown in Table 4. However, the factors to be considered when recommending surveillance include underlying risk for recurrence, patient comorbidity, and the ability to tolerate major surgery to resect recurrent disease or palliative chemotherapy, performance status, physiologic age, preference, and compliance. The success of surveillance for early detection of curable recurrence will depend on patient and provider involvement to adhere to the surveillance schedule and avoid unnecessary examination. It should be noted that, after curative resection of colorectal cancer, patients are still at risk for other common malignancies(lung, breast, cervix, prostate) for which standard screening recommendations should be observed and measures to maintain general health (risk reduction for cardiovascular disease, eg, cessation of smoking, control of blood pressure and diabetes mellitus, balanced diet, regular exercise and sleep, and flu vaccines) should be recommended.",Journal Article,1634.0,81.0,Current evidence suggests improved rates of curative secondary treatment following identification of recurrence among patients who participate in a surveillance program after initial curative resection of or cancer The newer data show that surveillance CEA chest and imaging and colonoscopy can also improve survival through early diagnosis of recurrence thus these modalities are now included in the current guideline Although the optimum strategy of surveillance for office visits CEA chest and imaging and colonoscopy is not yet defined routine surveillance does improve the detection of recurrence that can be resected with curative intent Recommended surveillance schedules are shown in Table 4 However the factors to be considered when recommending surveillance include underlying risk for recurrence patient comorbidity and the ability to tolerate major surgery to resect recurrent disease or palliative chemotherapy performance status physiologic age preference and compliance The success of surveillance for early detection of curable recurrence will depend on patient and provider involvement to adhere to the surveillance schedule and avoid unnecessary examination It should be noted that after curative resection of cancer patients are still at risk for other common malignancies cervix for which standard screening recommendations should be observed and measures to maintain general health risk reduction for cardiovascular disease eg cessation of smoking control of blood pressure and diabetes mellitus balanced diet regular exercise and sleep and flu vaccines should be recommended,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[291, 241, 844, 231, 151, 1, 1075, 568, 24, 366, 911, 1, 146, 107, 7, 54, 3506, 4, 8, 617, 1243, 50, 388, 1075, 170, 1, 15, 12, 3, 2246, 74, 514, 17, 617, 3088, 1662, 2, 270, 2, 3996, 122, 120, 401, 25, 298, 191, 147, 1, 146, 631, 46, 1558, 32, 1134, 159, 4, 3, 291, 2009, 242, 3, 6357, 692, 1, 617, 9, 6489, 2690, 3088, 1662, 2, 270, 2, 3996, 16, 44, 1145, 395, 1311, 617, 1097, 401, 3, 638, 1, 146, 17, 122, 40, 1133, 5, 1075, 1697, 793, 617, 2314, 32, 443, 4, 7016, 39, 137, 3, 130, 6, 40, 515, 198, 9040, 617, 643, 1181, 43, 9, 146, 69, 1879, 2, 3, 801, 6, 5010, 458, 152, 6, 13798, 387, 34, 15, 994, 56, 528, 156, 4628, 89, 3863, 2, 3336, 3, 1825, 1, 617, 9, 191, 638, 1, 4151, 146, 303, 4533, 23, 69, 2, 3094, 799, 6, 11898, 6, 3, 617, 1055, 2, 3085, 4224, 1385, 192, 257, 40, 1051, 17, 50, 1075, 170, 1, 12, 7, 32, 1234, 28, 43, 9, 127, 186, 441, 3629, 9, 92, 260, 453, 883, 257, 40, 164, 2, 1018, 6, 3040, 1083, 341, 43, 628, 9, 2179, 34, 2887, 3345, 1, 979, 182, 1, 315, 3738, 2, 1978, 6498, 4115, 2453, 3316, 2277, 2, 2494, 2, 5119, 1842, 257, 40, 793]",1596.0,26163950,98
Fusobacterium nucleatum and T Cells in Colorectal Carcinoma.,JAMA oncology,JAMA Oncol,2015-08-01,"Evidence indicates a complex link between gut microbiome, immunity, and intestinal tumorigenesis. To target the microbiota and immunity for colorectal cancer prevention and therapy, a better understanding of the relationship between microorganisms and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment is needed. Experimental evidence suggests that Fusobacterium nucleatum may promote colonic neoplasia development by downregulating antitumor T cell-mediated adaptive immunity. To test the hypothesis that a greater amount of F nucleatum in colorectal carcinoma tissue is associated with a lower density of T cells in tumor tissue. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on 598 rectal and colon carcinoma cases in 2 US nationwide prospective cohort studies with follow-up through 2006, the Nurses' Health Study (participants enrolled in 1976) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (participants enrolled in 1986). Tissue collection and processing were performed from 2002 through 2008, and immunity assessment, 2008 through 2009. From 2013 through 2014, the amount of F nucleatum in colorectal carcinoma tissue was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay; we equally dichotomized positive cases (high vs low). Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis was conducted in 2014 to assess associations of the amount of F nucleatum with densities (quartiles) of T cells in tumor tissue, controlling for clinical and tumor molecular features, including microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) methylation, and KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutation status. We adjusted the 2-sided α level to .013 for multiple hypothesis testing. Densities of CD3+, CD8+, CD45RO (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C [PTPRC])+, and FOXP3+ T cells in tumor tissue, determined by means of tissue microarray immunohistochemical analysis and computer-assisted image analysis. F nucleatum was detected in colorectal carcinoma tissue in 76 (13%) of 598 cases. Compared with F nucleatum-negative cases, F nucleatum-high cases were inversely associated with the density of CD3+ T cells (for a unit increase in quartile categories of CD3+ T cells as an outcome: multivariable odds ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.26-0.87]; P for trend = .006). The amount of F nucleatum was not significantly associated with the density of CD8+, CD45RO+, or FOXP3+ T cells (P fortrend = .24, .88, and .014, respectively). The amount of tissue F nucleatum is inversely associated with CD3+ T-cell density in colorectal carcinoma tissue.

"Effect of adding mFOLFOX6 after neoadjuvant chemoradiation in locally advanced rectal cancer: a multicentre, phase 2 trial.",The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2015-07-14,"Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who achieve a pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation have an improved prognosis. The need for surgery in these patients has been questioned, but the proportion of patients achieving a pathological complete response is small. We aimed to assess whether adding cycles of mFOLFOX6 between chemoradiation and surgery increased the proportion of patients achieving a pathological complete response. We did a phase 2, non-randomised trial consisting of four sequential study groups of patients with stage II-III locally advanced rectal cancer at 17 institutions in the USA and Canada. All patients received chemoradiation (fluorouracil 225 mg/m(2) per day by continuous infusion throughout radiotherapy, and 45·0 Gy in 25 fractions, 5 days per week for 5 weeks, followed by a minimum boost of 5·4 Gy). Patients in group 1 had total mesorectal excision 6-8 weeks after chemoradiation. Patients in groups 2-4 received two, four, or six cycles of mFOLFOX6, respectively, between chemoradiation and total mesorectal excision. Each cycle of mFOLFOX6 consisted of racemic leucovorin 200 mg/m(2) or 400 mg/m(2), according to the discretion of the treating investigator, oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2) in a 2-h infusion, bolus fluorouracil 400 mg/m(2) on day 1, and a 46-h infusion of fluorouracil 2400 mg/m(2). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a pathological complete response, analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00335816. Between March 24, 2004, and Nov 16, 2012, 292 patients were registered, 259 of whom (60 in group 1, 67 in group 2, 67 in group 3, and 65 in group 4) met criteria for analysis. 11 (18%, 95% CI 10-30) of 60 patients in group 1, 17 (25%, 16-37) of 67 in group 2, 20 (30%, 19-42) of 67 in group 3, and 25 (38%, 27-51) of 65 in group 4 achieved a pathological complete response (p=0·0036). Study group was independently associated with pathological complete response (group 4 compared with group 1 odds ratio 3·49, 95% CI 1·39-8·75; p=0·011). In group 2, two (3%) of 67 patients had grade 3 adverse events associated with the neoadjuvant administration of mFOLFOX6 and one (1%) had a grade 4 adverse event; in group 3, 12 (18%) of 67 patients had grade 3 adverse events; in group 4, 18 (28%) of 65 patients had grade 3 adverse events and five (8%) had grade 4 adverse events. The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events associated with the neoadjuvant administration of mFOLFOX6 across groups 2-4 were neutropenia (five in group 3 and six in group 4) and lymphopenia (three in group 3 and four in group 4). Across all study groups, 25 grade 3 or worse surgery-related complications occurred (ten in group 1, five in group 2, three in group 3, and seven in group 4); the most common were pelvic abscesses (seven patients) and anastomotic leaks (seven patients). Delivery of mFOLFOX6 after chemoradiation and before total mesorectal excision has the potential to increase the proportion of patients eligible for less invasive treatment strategies; this strategy is being tested in phase 3 clinical trials.

Early detection with screening endoscopy, in addition to improvement in treatment modalities lead to higher overall survival rates. Treatment of localized colon cancer comprises of surgical resection with en bloc lymphadenectomy. Adjuvant therapy is determined by final pathologic stage. However, treatment of rectal cancer is more complex and is determined by the clinical pathologic stage. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy is an important component to treatment to decrease the risk of local recurrence. As with colon cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy is dependent on the pathologic stage. Newer technologies are being utilized in both colon and rectal cancer including minimally invasive procedures and sphincter preservation procedures. Anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common histologic subtype of anal canal tumors. Anal SCC is most commonly seen in patients with HPV infections. Prior to the 1970s, anal SCC was treated with abdominoperineal resection and end colostomy. Nigro and colleagues utilized chemoradiation to treat anal SCC with response rates as high as 80%.

Fusobacterium nucleatum in colorectal carcinoma tissue and patient prognosis.,Gut,Gut,2015-08-26,"Accumulating evidence links the intestinal microbiota and colorectal carcinogenesis. Fusobacterium nucleatum may promote colorectal tumour growth and inhibit T cell-mediated immune responses against colorectal tumours. Thus, we hypothesised that the amount of F. nucleatum in colorectal carcinoma might be associated with worse clinical outcome. We used molecular pathological epidemiology database of 1069 rectal and colon cancer cases in the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, and measured F. nucleatum DNA in carcinoma tissue. Cox proportional hazards model was used to compute hazard ratio (HR), controlling for potential confounders, including microsatellite instability (MSI, mismatch repair deficiency), CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations, and LINE-1 hypomethylation (low-level methylation). Compared with F. nucleatum-negative cases, multivariable HRs (95% CI) for colorectal cancer-specific mortality in F. nucleatum-low cases and F. nucleatum-high cases were 1.25 (0.82 to 1.92) and 1.58 (1.04 to 2.39), respectively, (p for trend=0.020). The amount of F. nucleatum was associated with MSI-high (multivariable odd ratio (OR), 5.22; 95% CI 2.86 to 9.55) independent of CIMP and BRAF mutation status, whereas CIMP and BRAF mutation were associated with F. nucleatum only in univariate analyses (p<0.001) but not in multivariate analysis that adjusted for MSI status.

Adjuvant radiation therapy for bladder cancer: a dosimetric comparison of techniques.,Medical dosimetry : official journal of the American Association of Medical Dosimetrists,Med Dosim,2015-08-29,"Trials of adjuvant radiation after cystectomy are under development. There are no studies comparing radiation techniques to inform trial design. This study assesses the effect on bowel and rectal dose of 3 different modalities treating 2 proposed alternative clinical target volumes (CTVs). Contours of the bowel, rectum, CTV-pelvic sidewall (common/internal/external iliac and obturator nodes), and CTV-comprehensive (CTV-pelvic sidewall plus cystectomy bed and presacral regions) were drawn on simulation images of 7 post-cystectomy patients. We optimized 3-dimensional conformal radiation (3-D), intensity-modulated radiation (IMRT), and single-field uniform dose (SFUD) scanning proton plans for each CTV. Mixed models regression was used to compare plans for bowel and rectal volumes exposed to 35% (V35%), 65% (V65%), and 95% (V95%) of the prescribed dose. For any given treatment modality, treating the larger CTV-comprehensive volume compared with treating only the CTV-pelvic sidewall nodes significantly increased rectal dose (V35% rectum, V65% rectum, and V95% rectum; p < 0.001 for all comparisons), but it did not produce significant differences in bowel dose (V95% bowel, V65% bowel, or V35% bowel). The 3-D plans, compared with both the IMRT and the SFUD plans, had a significantly greater V65% bowel and V95% bowel for each proposed CTV (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). The effect of treatment modality on rectal dosimetry differed by CTV, but it generally favored the IMRT and the SFUD plans over the 3-D plans. Comparison of the IMRT plan vs the SFUD plan yielded mixed results with no consistent advantage for the SFUD plan over the IMRT plan. Targeting a CTV that spares the cystectomy bed and presacral region may marginally improve rectal toxicity but would not be expected to improve the bowel toxicity associated with any given modality of adjuvant radiation.

Flap reconstruction is being used in an attempt to improve wound healing. To assess the effect of flap reconstruction after APR on time to perineal wound healing and administration of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with rectal adenocarcinoma. A retrospective review of patients who underwent APR for rectal adenocarcinoma between 2002 and 2012 was performed. Patients were divided into two groups based on type of perineal wound closure (primary vs. flap). Patients were compared for time to perineal wound healing, and time to adjuvant chemotherapy. 115 patients were identified; of whom 67 received adjuvant chemotherapy. 56 (84%) patients underwent primary closure while 11 (16%) underwent flap reconstruction. There was no difference in time to perineal wound healing (6.8 vs. 6.3 weeks, p = 0.40) and time to receive adjuvant chemotherapy (9.3 vs. 10.7 weeks, p = 0.79) between the primary closure and flap reconstruction groups, respectively. 25 (45%) of the primary closure group had a delay in receiving adjuvant chemotherapy versus 6 (55%) of the flap reconstruction group (p = 0.55). Delay in receiving adjuvant chemotherapy because of perineal wound complications occurred in 18 (32%) patients with primary closure versus 3 (28%) patients with flap reconstruction (p = 0.14).

In short, the proximal and distal ends of a resection margin are approximated, small enterotomies made, a stapler is passed into both lumens creating a common channel, and lastly, this same stapler is used to create the anastomosis and amputate the specimen. We report on this technique with ileostomy reversal in terms of cost and complications. Review of ileostomy reversals (2006-2014) by a single surgical oncologist. Thirty patients had surgery using the Barcelona technique. Median age was 58 years, and median postoperative surgical stay was 3 days. The majority of patients had rectal cancer initially treated with low anterior resection and diverting loop ileostomy (80 %). One patient had a wound infection (3 %), and there were no anastomotic leaks, intra-abdominal abscesses, or strictures. This technique required fewer stapler loads saving $510 in charges per case. The Barcelona technique is safe and effective for ileostomy reversal.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 3 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances where evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment. The panel recognizes the importance of accurate staging to identify patients who may be candidates for a LE approach. Patients who may be candidates for LE alone include those with small, low-lying T1 tumors, without adverse pathologic features. Several surgical approaches can be utilized for LE however none include lymph node evaluation. Adjuvant radiation±chemotherapy may be warranted depending on the risk of nodal metastases. Patients with high-risk T1 tumors, T2 tumors not amenable to radical surgery may also benefit from adjuvant treatment; however, patients with positive margins or T3 lesions should be offered abdominoperineal resection or low anterior resection.

Neoadjuvant 5-FU or Capecitabine Plus Radiation With or Without Oxaliplatin in Rectal Cancer Patients: A Phase III Randomized Clinical Trial.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2015-09-14,"National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project R-04 was designed to determine whether the oral fluoropyrimidine capecitabine could be substituted for continuous infusion 5-FU in the curative setting of stage II/III rectal cancer during neoadjuvant radiation therapy and whether the addition of oxaliplatin could further enhance the activity of fluoropyrimidine-sensitized radiation. Patients with clinical stage II or III rectal cancer undergoing preoperative radiation were randomly assigned to one of four chemotherapy regimens in a 2x2 design: CVI 5-FU or oral capecitabine with or without oxaliplatin. The primary endpoint was local-regional tumor control. Time-to-event endpoint distributions were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Hazard ratios were estimated from Cox proportional hazard models. All statistical tests were two-sided. Among 1608 randomized patients there were no statistically significant differences between regimens using 5-FU vs capecitabine in three-year local-regional tumor event rates (11.2% vs 11.8%), 5-year DFS (66.4% vs 67.7%), or 5-year OS (79.9% vs 80.8%); or for oxaliplatin vs no oxaliplatin for the three endpoints of local-regional events, DFS, and OS (11.2% vs 12.1%, 69.2% vs 64.2%, and 81.3% vs 79.0%). The addition of oxaliplatin was associated with statistically significantly more overall and grade 3-4 diarrhea (P < .0001). Three-year rates of local-regional recurrence among patients who underwent R0 resection ranged from 3.1 to 5.1% depending on the study arm.

Impact of processes of care aimed at complication reduction on the cost of complex cancer surgery.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2015-09-22,"Health care providers add multiple processes to the care of complex cancer patients, believing they prevent and/or ameliorate complications. However, the relationship between these processes, complication remediation, and expenditures is unknown. Data for patients with cancer diagnoses undergoing colectomy, rectal resection, pulmonary lobectomy, pneumonectomy, esophagectomy, and pancreatic resection were obtained from hospital and inpatient physician Medicare claims for the years 2005-2009. Risk-adjusted regression analyses measured the association between hospitalization costs and processes presumed to prevent and/or remedy complications common to high-risk procedures. After controlling for comorbidities, analysis identified associations between increased costs and use of multiple processes, including arterial lines (4-12% higher; P < 0.001) and pulmonary artery catheters (23-33% higher; P < 0.001). Epidural analgesia was not associated with higher costs. Consultations were associated with 24-44% (P < 0.001) higher costs, and total parenteral nutrition was associated with 13-31% higher costs (P < 0.001). Many frequently utilized processes and services presumed to avoid and/or ameliorate complications are associated with increased surgical oncology costs.

MicroRNA MIR21 and T Cells in Colorectal Cancer.,Cancer immunology research,Cancer Immunol Res,2015-09-29,"The complex interactions between colorectal neoplasia and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment remain to be elucidated. Experimental evidence suggests that microRNA MIR21 (miR-21) suppresses antitumor T-cell-mediated immunity. Thus, we hypothesized that tumor MIR21 expression might be inversely associated with T-cell density in colorectal carcinoma tissue. Using 538 rectal and colon cancer cases from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, we measured tumor MIR21 expression by a quantitative reverse-transcription PCR assay. Densities of CD3(+), CD8(+), CD45RO (PTPRC)(+), and FOXP3(+) cells in tumor tissue were determined by tissue microarray immunohistochemistry and computer-assisted image analysis. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the association of MIR21 expression (ordinal quartiles as a predictor variable) with T-cell density (ordinal quartiles as an outcome variable), adjusting for tumor molecular features, including microsatellite instability; CpG island methylator phenotype; KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations; and LINE-1 methylation. We adjusted the two-sided α level to 0.012 for multiple hypothesis testing. Tumor MIR21 expression was inversely associated with densities of CD3(+) and CD45RO(+) cells (Ptrend < 0.0005). The multivariate odds ratio of the highest versus lowest quartile of MIR21 for a unit increase in quartile categories of CD3(+) or CD45RO(+) cells was 0.44 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.28 to 0.68] or 0.41 (95% CI, 0.26-0.64), respectively.

Postdiagnostic intake of one-carbon nutrients and alcohol in relation to colorectal cancer survival.,The American journal of clinical nutrition,Am. J. Clin. Nutr.,2015-09-30,"Observational data have suggested that intakes of nutrients involved in one-carbon metabolism are inversely associated with risk of colorectal carcinoma and adenomas. In contrast, results from some preclinical studies and cardiovascular and chemoprevention trials have raised concerns that high folate intake may promote carcinogenesis by facilitating the progression of established neoplasia. We tested the hypothesis that higher total folate intake (including food folate and folic acid from fortified foods and supplements) or other one-carbon nutrient intakes might be associated with poorer survival after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer. We used rectal and colon cancer cases within the following 2 US prospective cohort studies: the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. Biennial questionnaires were used to gather information on medical history and lifestyle factors, including smoking and alcohol consumption. B-vitamin and methionine intakes were derived from food-frequency questionnaires. Data on tumor molecular characteristics (including microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations, and long interspersed nucleotide element 1 methylation level) were available for a subset of cases. We assessed colorectal cancer-specific mortality according to postdiagnostic intakes of one-carbon nutrients with the use of multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. In 1550 stage I-III colorectal cancer cases with a median follow-up of 14.9 y, we documented 641 deaths including 176 colorectal cancer-specific deaths. No statistically significant associations were observed between postdiagnostic intakes of folate or other one-carbon nutrients and colorectal cancer-specific mortality (multivariate P-trend ≥ 0.21).

High Rate of Positive Circumferential Resection Margins Following Rectal Cancer Surgery: A Call to Action.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2015-12-01,"To identify predictors of positive circumferential resection margin following rectal cancer resection in the United States. Positive circumferential resection margin is associated with a high rate of local recurrence and poor morbidity and mortality for rectal cancer patients. Prior study has shown poor compliance with national rectal cancer guidelines, but whether this finding is reflected in patient outcomes has yet to be shown. Patients who underwent resection for stage I-III rectal cancer were identified from the 2010-2011 National Cancer Database. The primary outcome was a positive circumferential resection margin. The relationship between patient, hospital, tumor, and treatment-related characteristics was analyzed using bivariate and multivariate analysis. A positive circumferential resection margin was noted in 2859 (17.2%) of the 16,619 patients included. Facility location, clinical T and N stage, histologic type, tumor size, tumor grade, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, type of operation, and operative approach were significant predictors of positive circumferential resection margin on multivariable analysis. Total proctectomy had nearly a 30% increased risk of positive margin compared with partial proctectomy (OR 1.293, 95%CI 1.185-1.411) and a laparoscopic approach had nearly 22% less risk of a positive circumferential resection margin compared with an open approach (OR 0.882, 95%CI 0.790-0.985).

"Organ Preservation in Rectal Adenocarcinoma: a phase II randomized controlled trial evaluating 3-year disease-free survival in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with chemoradiation plus induction or consolidation chemotherapy, and total mesorectal excision or nonoperative management.",BMC cancer,BMC Cancer,2015-10-23,"Treatment of patients with non-metastatic, locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) includes pre-operative chemoradiation, total mesorectal excision (TME) and post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy. This trimodality treatment provides local tumor control in most patients; but almost one-third ultimately die from distant metastasis. Most survivors experience significant impairment in quality of life (QoL), due primarily to removal of the rectum. A current challenge lies in identifying patients who could safely undergo rectal preservation without sacrificing survival benefit and QoL. This multi-institutional, phase II study investigates the efficacy of total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) and selective non-operative management (NOM) in LARC. Patients with MRI-staged Stage II or III rectal cancer amenable to TME will be randomized to receive FOLFOX/CAPEOX: a) before induction neoadjuvant chemotherapy (INCT); or b) after consolidation neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CNCT), with 5-FU or capecitabine-based chemoradiation. Patients in both arms will be re-staged after completing all neoadjuvant therapy. Those with residual tumor at the primary site will undergo TME. Patients with clinical complete response (cCR) will receive non-operative management (NOM). NOM patients will be followed every 3 months for 2 years, and every 6 months thereafter. TME patients will be followed according to NCCN guidelines. All will be followed for at least 5 years from the date of surgery or--in patients treated with NOM--the last day of treatment. The studies published thus far on the safety of NOM in LARC have compared survival between select groups of patients with a cCR after NOM, to patients with a pathologic complete response (pCR) after TME. The current study compares 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) in an entire population of patients with LARC, including those with cCR and those with pCR. We will compare the two arms of the study with respect to organ preservation at 3 years, treatment compliance, adverse events and surgical complications. We will measure QoL in both groups. We will analyze molecular indications that may lead to more individually tailored treatments in the future. This will be the first NOM trial utilizing a regression schema for response assessment in a prospective fashion.

In this study, we examined whether higher habitual dietary intakes of flavonoid subclasses (flavonols, flavones, flavanones, flavan-3-ols, and anthocyanins) were associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer. Using data from validated food-frequency questionnaires administered every 4 y and an updated flavonoid food composition database, we calculated flavonoid intakes for 42,478 male participants from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study and for 76,364 female participants from the Nurses' Health Study. During up to 26 y of follow-up, 2519 colorectal cancer cases (1061 in men, 1458 in women) were documented. Intakes of flavonoid subclasses were not associated with risk of colorectal cancer in either cohort. Pooled multivariable adjusted RRs (95% CIs) comparing the highest with the lowest quintiles were 1.04 (0.91, 1.18) for flavonols, 1.01 (0.89, 1.15) for flavones, 0.96 (0.84, 1.10) for flavanones, 1.07 (0.95, 1.21) for flavan-3-ols, and 0.98 (0.81, 1.19) for anthocyanins (all P values for heterogeneity by sex >0.19). In subsite analyses, flavonoid intake was also not associated with colon or rectal cancer risk.

"Molecular profiling of 6,892 colorectal cancer samples suggests different possible treatment options specific to metastatic sites.",Cancer biology & therapy,Cancer Biol. Ther.,2015-01-01,"Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) carries a poor prognosis with an overall 5-year survival of 13.1%. Therapies guided by tumor profiling have suggested benefit in advanced cancer. We used a multiplatform molecular profiling (MP) approach to identify key molecular changes that may provide therapeutic options not typically considered in mCRC. We evaluated 6892 mCRC referred to Caris Life Sciences by MP including sequencing (Sanger/NGS), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in-situ hybridization (ISH). mCRC metastases to liver, brain, ovary or lung (n = 1507) showed differential expression of markers including high protein expression of TOPO1 (52%) and/or low RRM1 (57%), TS (71%) and MGMT (39%), suggesting possible benefit from irinotecan, gemcitabine, 5FU/capecitabine and temozolomide, respectively. Lung metastases harbored a higher Her2 protein expression than the primary colon tumors (4% vs. 1.8%, p = 0.028). Brain and lung metastases had higher KRAS mutations than other sites (65% vs 59% vs 47%, respectively, p = 0.07, <0.01), suggesting poor response to anti-EGFR therapies. BRAF-mutated CRC (n = 455) showed coincident high protein expression of RRM1 (56%), TS (53%) and low PDGFR (22%) as compared with BRAF wild-type tumors. KRAS-mutated mCRC had higher protein expression of c-MET (47% vs. 36%) and lower MGMT (56% vs. 63%), suggesting consideration of c-MET inhibitors and temozolomide. KRAS-mutated CRC had high TUBB3 (42% vs. 33%) and low Her2 by IHC (0.5%) and HER2 by FISH (3%, p <0.05). CRC primaries had a lower incidence of PIK3CA and BRAF mutations in rectal cancer versus colon cancer (10% and 3.3%, respectively). MP of 6892 CRCs identified significant differences between primary and metastatic sites and among BRAF/KRAS sub-types. Our findings are hypothesis generating and need to be examined in prospective studies. Specific therapies may be considered for different actionable targets in mCRC as revealed by MP.

Anorectal Cancer: Critical Anatomic and Staging Distinctions That Affect Use of Radiation Therapy.,"Radiographics : a review publication of the Radiological Society of North America, Inc",Radiographics,,"Although rectal and anal cancers are anatomically close, they are distinct entities with different histologic features, risk factors, staging systems, and treatment pathways. Imaging is at the core of initial clinical staging of these cancers and most commonly includes magnetic resonance imaging for local-regional staging and computed tomography for evaluation of metastatic disease. The details of the primary tumor and involvement of regional lymph nodes are crucial in determining if and how radiation therapy should be used in treatment of these cancers. Unfortunately, available imaging modalities have been shown to have imperfect accuracy for identification of nodal metastases and imaging features other than size. Staging of nonmetastatic rectal cancers is dependent on the depth of invasion (T stage) and the number of involved regional lymph nodes (N stage). Staging of nonmetastatic anal cancers is determined according to the size of the primary mass and the combination of regional nodal sites involved; the number of positive nodes at each site is not a consideration for staging. Patients with T3 rectal tumors and/or involvement of perirectal, mesenteric, and internal iliac lymph nodes receive radiation therapy. Almost all anal cancers warrant use of radiation therapy, but the extent and dose of the radiation fields is altered on the basis of both the size of the primary lesion and the presence and extent of nodal involvement.

Survival Benefit of Exercise Differs by Tumor IRS1 Expression Status in Colorectal Cancer.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2015-11-17,"High-level physical activity is associated with lower colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality, likely through insulin sensitization. Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) is a mediator of insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathways, and its down-regulation is associated with insulin resistance. Therefore, we hypothesized that tumor IRS1 expression status might modify cellular sensitivity to insulin and IGF, and the prognostic association of physical activity. We assessed IRS1 expression level in 371 stage I-III rectal and colon cancers in the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study by immunohistochemistry. In survival analysis, Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess an interaction between post-diagnosis physical activity (ordinal scale of sex-specific quartiles Q1 to Q4) and IRS1 expression (ordinal scale of negative, low, and high), controlling for potential confounders, including microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) methylation level, and KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutation status. There was a statistically significant interaction between post-diagnosis physical activity and tumor IRS1 expression in CRC-specific mortality analysis (P interaction = 0.005).

Prediagnosis Plasma Adiponectin in Relation to Colorectal Cancer Risk According to KRAS Mutation Status.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2015-11-23,"Low levels of adiponectin (ADIPOQ; HGNC ID; HGNC:13633), an adipokine, are associated with obesity, adiposity, excess energy balance, and increased risk of colorectal neoplasia. Given the reported association of increased body mass index (BMI) and low-level physical activity with KRAS-mutated colorectal tumor, we hypothesized that low-level plasma adiponectin might be associated with increased risk of KRAS-mutant colorectal carcinoma but not with risk of KRAS wild-type carcinoma. We conducted molecular pathological epidemiology research using a nested case-control study design (307 incident rectal and colon cancer case patients and 593 matched control individuals) within prospective cohort studies, the Nurses' Health Study (152 case patients and 297 control individuals, with blood collection in 1989-1990) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (155 case patients and 296 control individuals, with blood collection in 1993-1995). Multivariable conditional logistic regression models and two-sided likelihood ratio tests were used to assess etiologic heterogeneity of the associations. The association of low-level plasma adiponectin with colorectal cancer risk statistically significantly differed by KRAS mutation status (P heterogeneity = .004). Low levels of plasma adiponectin were associated with KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer (for the lowest vs highest tertile: multivariable odds ratio [OR] = 2.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.50 to 5.34, P trend = .002) but not with KRAS wild-type cancer (for the lowest vs highest tertile: multivariable OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.49 to 1.43, P trend = .48).

XPO1 Inhibition Enhances Radiation Response in Preclinical Models of Rectal Cancer.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2015-11-24,"Combination of radiation with radiosensitizing chemotherapeutic agents improves outcomes for locally advanced rectal cancer. Current treatment includes 5-fluorouracil-based chemoradiation prior to surgical resection; however pathologic complete response varies from 15% to 20%, prompting the need to identify new radiosensitizers. Exportin 1 (XPO1, also known as chromosome region 1, CRM1) mediates the nuclear export of critical proteins required for rectal cancer proliferation and treatment resistance. We hypothesize that inhibition of XPO1 may radiosensitize cancer cells by altering the function of these critical proteins resulting in decreased radiation resistance and enhanced antitumoral effects. To test our hypothesis, we used the selective XPO1 inhibitor, selinexor, to inhibit nuclear export in combination with radiation fractions similar to that given in clinical practice for rectal cancer: hypofractionated short-course radiation dosage of 5 Gy per fraction or the conventional long-course radiation dosage of 1 Gy fractions. Single and combination treatments were tested in colorectal cancer cell lines and xenograft tumor models. Combination treatment of radiotherapy and selinexor resulted in an increase of apoptosis and decrease of proliferation compared with single treatment, which correlated with reduced tumor size. We found that the combination promoted nuclear survivin accumulation and subsequent depletion, resulting in increased apoptosis and enhanced radiation antitumoral effects. Our findings suggest a novel therapeutic option for improving radiation sensitivity in the setting of rectal cancer and provide the scientific rationale to evaluate this combination strategy for clinical trials.",Journal Article,1519.0,12.0,Combination of radiation with radiosensitizing chemotherapeutic agents improves outcomes for locally advanced cancer Current treatment includes 5-fluorouracil-based chemoradiation prior to surgical resection however pathologic complete response varies from 15 to 20 prompting the need to identify new radiosensitizers Exportin 1 XPO1 also known as chromosome region 1 CRM1 mediates the nuclear export of critical proteins required for cancer proliferation and treatment resistance We hypothesize that inhibition of XPO1 may radiosensitize cancer cells by altering the function of these critical proteins resulting in decreased radiation resistance and enhanced antitumoral effects To test our hypothesis we used the selective XPO1 inhibitor selinexor to inhibit nuclear export in combination with radiation fractions similar to that given in clinical practice for cancer hypofractionated short-course radiation dosage of 5 Gy per fraction or the conventional long-course radiation dosage of 1 Gy fractions Single and combination treatments were tested in cancer cell lines and xenograft tumor models Combination treatment of radiotherapy and selinexor resulted in an increase of apoptosis and decrease of proliferation compared with single treatment which correlated with reduced tumor size We found that the combination promoted nuclear survivin accumulation and subsequent depletion resulting in increased apoptosis and enhanced radiation antitumoral effects Our findings suggest a novel therapeutic option for improving radiation sensitivity in the setting of cancer and provide the scientific rationale to evaluate this combination strategy for clinical trials,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[150, 1, 121, 5, 8384, 1573, 183, 1804, 123, 9, 795, 131, 12, 291, 24, 1920, 33, 1404, 90, 975, 324, 6, 221, 170, 137, 510, 236, 51, 4037, 29, 167, 6, 179, 8499, 3, 594, 6, 255, 217, 11763, 18663, 14, 9933, 120, 440, 22, 1170, 1053, 14, 15053, 3961, 3, 928, 8202, 1, 740, 652, 616, 9, 12, 457, 2, 24, 251, 21, 4919, 17, 297, 1, 9933, 68, 17689, 12, 37, 20, 4831, 3, 343, 1, 46, 740, 652, 1113, 4, 340, 121, 251, 2, 651, 13808, 176, 6, 412, 114, 1492, 21, 95, 3, 1094, 9933, 230, 7233, 6, 1433, 928, 8202, 4, 150, 5, 121, 1550, 288, 6, 17, 447, 4, 38, 758, 9, 12, 4479, 978, 906, 121, 3323, 1, 33, 381, 379, 1509, 15, 3, 809, 319, 906, 121, 3323, 1, 14, 381, 1550, 226, 2, 150, 640, 11, 650, 4, 12, 31, 285, 2, 1330, 30, 274, 150, 24, 1, 310, 2, 7233, 627, 4, 35, 344, 1, 351, 2, 775, 1, 457, 72, 5, 226, 24, 92, 438, 5, 405, 30, 444, 21, 204, 17, 3, 150, 2992, 928, 3160, 1835, 2, 706, 2286, 1113, 4, 101, 351, 2, 651, 121, 13808, 176, 114, 272, 309, 8, 229, 189, 1501, 9, 1673, 121, 485, 4, 3, 546, 1, 12, 2, 377, 3, 3138, 1728, 6, 376, 26, 150, 692, 9, 38, 143]",1664.0,26603256,102

We sought to investigate potential genetic associations between some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the risk of CRC in the Chinese Han population. We conducted a case-control study including 269 cases and 309 controls. Sixteen SNPs associated with CRC risk were selected from previous genome-wide association studies and genotyped using Sequenom MassARRAY technology. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by unconditional logistic regression adjusting for age and gender. Using the chi-squared test we found that rs9365723 was associated with CRC risk (p = 0.012).

Young Age Increases Risk of Lymph Node Positivity  in Early-Stage Rectal Cancer.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2016-01-01,"The risk of lymph node positivity (LN+) in rectal cancer is a parameter that impacts therapeutic recommendations. We aimed to quantify the effect of younger age on LN+ in rectal cancer. Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, patients with rectal cancer diagnosed between 1988 and 2008 were identified. Patients were stage I-III, without preoperative radiotherapy, at least one lymph node examined, and a standard rectal cancer operation performed. The association of age and LN+ status was examined with logistic regression separately for each T stage, adjusting for multiple covariates. Poisson regression was used to evaluate age and number of positive lymph nodes (LNs). All statistical tests were two-sided. Fifty-six thousand seventy-six patients were identified, including 1194 (2.1%) patients age 20 to 39 years at diagnosis and 4199 (7.5%) patients age 40 to 49 years (defined as young).

Therefore, we hypothesised that loss of CDH1 expression in colorectal carcinoma might be associated with aggressive features and clinical outcome. Utilising molecular pathological epidemiology database of 689 rectal and colon cancer cases in the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, we assessed tumour CDH1 expression by immunohistochemistry. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess association of CDH1 loss with tumour growth pattern (expansile-intermediate vs infiltrative) and lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis, controlling for potential confounders including microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, LINE-1 methylation, and PIK3CA, BRAF and KRAS mutations.

Cancer Res.,2016-02-01,"Cross-talk between type I IGF receptor (IGF1R), insulin receptor (INSR), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mediates resistance to individual receptor blockade. This study aimed to determine the MTD, safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of linsitinib, a potent oral IGF1R/INSR inhibitor, with EGFR inhibitor erlotinib. This open-label, dose-escalation study investigated linsitinib schedules S1: once daily intermittent (days 1-3 weekly); S2, once daily continuous; S3, twice-daily continuous; each with erlotinib 100-150 mg once daily; and a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) expansion cohort. Ninety-five patients were enrolled (S1, 44; S2, 24; S3, 12; expansion cohort, 15) and 91 treated. Seven experienced dose-limiting toxicities: QTc prolongation (3), abnormal liver function (2), hyperglycemia (1), and anorexia (1). Common adverse events included drug eruption (84%), diarrhea (73%), fatigue (68%), nausea (58%), vomiting (40%). MTDs for linsitinib/erlotinib were 450/150 mg (S1), 400/100 mg (S2). On the basis of prior monotherapy data, S3 dosing at 150 mg twice daily/150 mg once daily was the recommended phase II dose for the expansion cohort. There was no evidence of drug-drug interaction. Pharmacodynamic data showed IGF-1 elevation and reduced IGF1R/INSR phosphorylation, suggesting pathway inhibition. Across schedules, 5/75 (7%) evaluable patients experienced partial responses: spinal chordoma (268+ weeks), rectal cancer (36 weeks), three NSCLCs including 2 adenocarcinomas (16, 72 weeks), 1 squamous wild-type EGFR NSCLC (36 weeks). Disease control (CR+PR+SD) occurred in 38 of 75 (51%), and 28 of 91 (31%) patients were on study >12 weeks.

The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Recommendations for Prostate Cancer Screening.,Urology,Urology,2016-02-02,"The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) recommendations on prostate cancer screening were developed in response to three limitations of previous screening guidelines: insufficient evidence base, failure to link screening with treatment, and lack of risk stratification. The objective of the recommendations is to provide a schema for prostate cancer screening that maximizes the benefits, in terms of reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality, and minimizes the harms, in terms of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. We recommend the following schema for men choosing to be screened following informed decision-making: starting at age 45, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) without digital rectal examination. If PSA ≥ 3 ng/mL: consider prostate biopsy; if PSA ≥ 1 but < 3 ng/mL: return for PSA testing every 2-4 years; if PSA < 1 ng/mL: return for PSA testing at 6-10 years. PSA testing should end at age 60 for men with PSA ≤ 1 ng/ mL; at 70, unless a man is very healthy and has a higher than average PSA; at 75 for all men. The decision to biopsy a man with a PSA > 3 ng/mL should be based on a variety of factors including repeat blood draw for confirmatory testing of the PSA level, digital rectal examination results, and workup for benign disease. Additional reflex tests in blood such as a free-to-total PSA ratio, the Prostate Health Index, or 4Kscore, or urinary testing of PCA3, can also be informative in some patients. The best evidence suggests that more restricted indication for prostate biopsy and a more focused approach to pursue screening in men at highest risk of lethal cancer would retain most of the mortality benefits of aggressive screening schema, while importantly reducing harms from overdetection and overtreatment.",Journal Article,1449.0,32.0,The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center MSKCC recommendations on cancer screening were developed in response to three limitations of previous screening guidelines insufficient evidence base failure to link screening with treatment and lack of risk stratification The objective of the recommendations is to provide a schema for cancer screening that maximizes the benefits in terms of reduction in cancer-specific mortality and minimizes the harms in terms of overdiagnosis and overtreatment We recommend the following schema for men choosing to be screened following informed decision-making starting at age 45 prostate-specific antigen PSA without digital examination If PSA ≥ 3 ng/mL consider biopsy if PSA ≥ 1 but 3 ng/mL return for PSA testing every 2-4 years if PSA 1 ng/mL return for PSA testing at 6-10 years PSA testing should end at age 60 for men with PSA ≤ 1 ng/ mL at 70 unless a man is very healthy and has a higher than average PSA at 75 for all men The decision to biopsy a man with a PSA 3 ng/mL should be based on a variety of factors including repeat blood draw for confirmatory testing of the PSA level digital examination results and workup for benign disease Additional reflex tests in blood such as a free-to-total PSA ratio the Health Index or 4Kscore or urinary testing of PCA3 can also be informative in some patients The best evidence suggests that more restricted indication for biopsy and a more focused approach to pursue screening in men at highest risk of lethal cancer would retain most of the mortality benefits of aggressive screening schema while importantly reducing harms from overdetection and overtreatment,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[3, 2563, 2783, 2784, 12, 574, 4191, 883, 23, 12, 453, 11, 276, 4, 51, 6, 169, 1939, 1, 698, 453, 677, 3027, 241, 1782, 496, 6, 3460, 453, 5, 24, 2, 926, 1, 43, 1541, 3, 461, 1, 3, 883, 16, 6, 377, 8, 8371, 9, 12, 453, 17, 15939, 3, 1141, 4, 1794, 1, 628, 4, 12, 112, 282, 2, 14527, 3, 6753, 4, 1794, 1, 10700, 2, 7720, 21, 2237, 3, 366, 8371, 9, 325, 5065, 6, 40, 2261, 366, 2767, 948, 1079, 1723, 28, 89, 512, 1364, 112, 448, 534, 187, 3271, 1385, 492, 534, 749, 27, 997, 542, 2419, 411, 492, 534, 749, 14, 84, 27, 997, 542, 4656, 9, 534, 471, 454, 18, 39, 60, 492, 534, 14, 997, 542, 4656, 9, 534, 471, 28, 49, 79, 60, 534, 471, 257, 396, 28, 89, 335, 9, 325, 5, 534, 1552, 14, 997, 542, 28, 431, 6179, 8, 3628, 16, 923, 1331, 2, 71, 8, 142, 76, 1011, 534, 28, 481, 9, 62, 325, 3, 948, 6, 411, 8, 3628, 5, 8, 534, 27, 997, 542, 257, 40, 90, 23, 8, 1362, 1, 130, 141, 2334, 315, 7223, 9, 5697, 471, 1, 3, 534, 301, 3271, 1385, 99, 2, 4755, 9, 1002, 34, 402, 10265, 895, 4, 315, 225, 22, 8, 115, 6, 181, 534, 197, 3, 341, 558, 15, 67592, 15, 1660, 471, 1, 13165, 122, 120, 40, 4189, 4, 476, 7, 3, 824, 241, 844, 17, 80, 2016, 3607, 9, 411, 2, 8, 80, 1649, 353, 6, 7874, 453, 4, 325, 28, 1076, 43, 1, 2266, 12, 688, 6630, 96, 1, 3, 282, 1141, 1, 571, 453, 8371, 369, 1859, 1818, 6753, 29, 20905, 2, 7720]",1648.0,26850815,170
Oncologic Outcomes of Extended Robotic Resection for Rectal Cancer.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2016-02-08,"Surgery for locally advanced rectal cancers beyond the plane of total mesorectal excision (TME) or extramesorectal nodal involvement should include complete resection. This study evaluated the oncologic feasibility and safety of robot-assisted surgery for rectal cancer beyond the TME plane. The study analyzed the operative, perioperative, and oncologic outcomes for all patients who underwent robot-assisted extended rectal cancer surgery from April 2009 to February 2015. Of 36 patients, 22 underwent multivisceral en bloc resection, and 18 underwent extramesorectal lymph node (EMRLN) dissection. The median tumor location was 5 cm [interquartile range (IQR), 2.2-9.0 cm] from the anal verge. A total of 32 patients underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy. The median body mass index of the patients was 26.8 kg/m(2) (IQR, 24.0-31.9 kg/m(2)). Conversion was required for one patient because of inability to tolerate the Trendelenburg position. All the resections were R0, and there were no incomplete TMEs. The vagina and prostate or periprostatic structures were the most commonly resected (n = 13/22), and the lateral pelvic nodes were the most common EMRLNs (n = 16/18). The median numbers of examined mesorectal lymph nodes and EMRLNs were respectively 20 (IQR, 18.0-28.0) and 2.5 (IQR, 1.0-6.0). The median hospital stay was 4 days (IQR, 3.0-5.5 days). Six patients experienced Clavien-Dindo grade 3 complications, the most common of which was deep abscess (n = 5, 13.8 %). The 5-year actuarial local recurrence rate was 3.6 %.

Phase I study of pre-operative continuous 5-FU and sorafenib with external radiation therapy in locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma.,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,Radiother Oncol,2016-02-06,"The standard of care in locally advanced rectal cancer is preoperative treatment with fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy. Sorafenib works synergistically with radiation and inhibits Ras/Raf, PDFGR, and VEGFR. This phase I study evaluated the safety and efficacy of sorafenib with infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and radiation in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Patients with confirmed stage II or III rectal cancer were recruited in 4 cohorts of 3 patients per dose level, with an expansion cohort at the maximum tolerated dose. A 3+3 dose escalation design was used. Radiation was given in 28 fractions at 1.8 Gy (50.4 Gy) day 1-5 at all dose levels. Initial dose of sorafenib was 200mg qd and titrated up to 400mg BID to determine the MTD. Standard dose of infusional 5-FU was used (225 mg/m(2)/24h). Patients underwent surgery 6-10 weeks after neoadjuvant therapy. Between August 2011 and August 2014, 17 patients (median age of 54 years) were enrolled. After toxicities requiring dose interruptions were observed in cohort 1 (2 patients with grade 2 (G2) and grade 3 (G3) hand foot skin reaction and 1 patient with G2 mucositis), the protocol was amended, changing administration of chemotherapy and sorafenib from daily to days 1-5 only. With the amended protocol, the primary G3 toxicity was hypertension in 2 patients at the 200-mg adjusted dose level (day1-5) and 1 patient at the 400-mg twice daily dose level. One patient had G3 ALT elevation at 400mg, and no grade IV toxicities were observed. G1 and G2 toxicities included hand-foot skin reaction, diarrhea, mucositis, nausea, fatigue, and proctitis.

Active Surveillance for the Management of Localized Prostate Cancer (Cancer Care Ontario Guideline): American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guideline Endorsement.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-02-16,"To endorse Cancer Care Ontario's guideline on Active Surveillance for the Management of Localized Prostate Cancer. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has a policy and set of procedures for endorsing clinical practice guidelines developed by other professional organizations. The Active Surveillance for the Management of Localized Prostate Cancer guideline was reviewed for developmental rigor by methodologists. The ASCO Endorsement Panel then reviewed the content and the recommendations. The ASCO Endorsement Panel determined that the recommendations from the Active Surveillance for the Management of Localized Prostate Cancer guideline, published in May 2015, are clear, thorough, and based upon the most relevant scientific evidence. ASCO endorsed the Active Surveillance for the Management of Localized Prostate Cancer guideline with added qualifying statements. The Cancer Care Ontario recommendation regarding 5-alpha reductase inhibitors was not endorsed by the ASCO panel. For most patients with low-risk (Gleason score ≤ 6) localized prostate cancer, active surveillance is the recommended disease management strategy. Factors including younger age, prostate cancer volume, patient preference, and ethnicity should be taken into account when making management decisions. Select patients with low-volume, intermediate-risk (Gleason 3 + 4 = 7) prostate cancer may be offered active surveillance. Active surveillance protocols should include prostate-specific antigen testing, digital rectal examinations, and serial prostate biopsies. Ancillary radiologic and genomic tests are investigational but may have a role in patients with discordant clinical and/or pathologic findings.

Trends in the Treatment of Metastatic Colon and Rectal Cancer in Elderly Patients.,Medical care,Med Care,2016-05-01,"Little is known about the use and costs of antineoplastic regimens for elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We report population-based trends over a 10-year period in the treatment, survival, and costs in mCRC patients, stratified by ages 65-74 and 75+. We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data for persons diagnosed with metastatic colon (N=16117) or rectal cancer (N=4008) between 2000 and 2009. We estimated the adjusted percent of patients who received antineoplastic agents, by type, number, and their costs 12 months following diagnosis. We report the percent of patients who received 3 or more of commonly prescribed agents and estimate survival for the 24-month period following diagnosis by age and treatment. The percentage that received 3 or more agents increased from 3% to 73% in colon patients aged 65-74 and from 2% to 53% in patients 75+. Similar increases were observed in rectal patients.

Appropriate customization of radiation therapy for stage II and III rectal cancer: Executive summary of an ASTRO Clinical Practice Statement using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method.,Practical radiation oncology,Pract Radiat Oncol,2015-11-24,"To summarize results of a Clinical Practice Statement on radiation therapy for stage II-III rectal cancer, which addressed appropriate customization of (neo)adjuvant radiation therapy and use of non-surgical therapy for patients who are inoperable or refuse abdominoperineal resection. The RAND/University of California, Los Angeles, Appropriateness Method was applied to combine current evidence with multidisciplinary expert opinion. A systematic literature review was conducted and used by the expert panel to rate appropriateness of radiation therapy options for different clinical scenarios. Treatments were categorized by median rating as Appropriate, May Be Appropriate, or Rarely Appropriate. In the neoadjuvant setting, chemoradiation was rated Appropriate and the ratings indicated short-course radiation therapy, chemotherapy alone, and no neoadjuvant therapy are potential options in selected patients. However, neoadjuvant endorectal brachytherapy was rated Rarely Appropriate. For adjuvant therapy, chemoradiation (plus ≥4 months of chemotherapy) was rated Appropriate and chemotherapy alone May Be Appropriate for most scenarios. For medically inoperable patients, definitive external beam radiation therapy and chemotherapy alone were rated May Be Appropriate, whereas endorectal brachytherapy and chemoradiation plus endorectal brachytherapy were possible approaches for some scenarios. The last option, definitive chemoradiation, was rated Appropriate to May Be Appropriate based on performance status.

This retrospective study included 24 uniformly-treated patients with biopsy-proven rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent MRI, including diffusion-weighted (DW) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequences, before and after completion of CRT. On all MRI exams, two experienced readers independently measured longest and perpendicular tumour diameters, tumour volume, tumour regression grade (TRG) and tumour signal intensity ratio on T2-weighted imaging, as well as tumour volume and apparent diffusion coefficient on DW-MRI and tumour volume and transfer constant K<sup>trans</sup> on DCE-MRI. These metrics were correlated with histopathological percent tumour regression in the resected specimen (%TR). Inter-reader agreement was assessed using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). For both readers, post-treatment DW-MRI and DCE-MRI volumetric tumour assessments were significantly associated with %TR; DCE-MRI volumetry showed better inter-reader agreement (CCC=0.700) than DW-MRI volumetry (CCC=0.292). For one reader, mrTRG, post-treatment T2 tumour volumetry and assessments of volume change made with T2, DW-MRI and DCE-MRI were also significantly associated with %TR.

MicroRNA MIR21 (miR-21) and PTGS2 Expression in Colorectal Cancer and Patient Survival.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2016-03-08,"Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2, cyclooxygenase-2; a target of aspirin) produces inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and contributes to colorectal neoplasia development. PTGS2-driven inflammatory responses can induce tumor expression of microRNA MIR21 (miR-21) that can increase local PGE2 level by downregulating PGE2-metabolizing enzymes. We hypothesized that the prognostic association of tumor MIR21 expression level in colorectal carcinoma might depend on inflammatory tumor microenvironment and be stronger in tumors expressing high-level PTGS2. Utilizing 765 rectal and colon cancer specimens in the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, we measured MIR21 expression by quantitative reverse transcription PCR, and PTGS2 expression by immunohistochemistry. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess statistical interaction between MIR21 and PTGS2 in colorectal cancer-specific survival analysis, controlling for potential confounders including microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, LINE-1 methylation level, and KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations. Tumor MIR21 expression level was associated with higher colorectal cancer-specific mortality (Ptrend = 0.029), and there was a statistically significant interaction between MIR21 and PTGS2 (Pinteraction = 0.0004). The association between MIR21 expression and colorectal cancer-specific mortality was statistically significant in PTGS2-high cancers (multivariable hazard ratio of the highest vs. lowest quartile of MIR21, 2.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.42-3.67; Ptrend = 0.0004) but not in PTGS2-absent/low cancers (Ptrend = 0.22). MIR21 expression level in colorectal carcinoma is associated with worse clinical outcome, and this association is stronger in carcinomas expressing high-level PTGS2, suggesting complex roles of immunity and inflammation in tumor progression.

Predictors of Safety and Efficacy of 2-Stage Hepatectomy for Bilateral Colorectal Liver Metastases.,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,J. Am. Coll. Surg.,2016-01-18,"In patients with bilateral colorectal liver metastases (CLM) not resectable in 1 operation, 2-stage hepatectomy is the standard surgical approach. The objective of this study was to determine factors associated with safety and efficacy of 2-stage hepatectomy. The study included all 109 patients for whom 2-stage hepatectomy for CLM was planned during 2003 to 2014. The RAS mutation status and other clinicopathologic factors were evaluated for association with major complications and survival using multivariate analysis. Two-stage hepatectomy was completed in 89 of 109 patients (82%). Reasons for dropout after the first stage were disease progression (n = 12), insufficient liver growth (n = 5), and complications after first stage or portal vein embolization (n = 3). More than 6 cycles of preoperative chemotherapy were associated with failure to proceed to the second stage (p = 0.009). Rates of major complications (26% vs 6%; p < 0.001) and 90-day mortality (7% vs 0%; p = 0.006) were higher after the second stage. The cumulative rate of major complications was 15% (n = 29). Factors independently associated with major complications were rectal primary tumor, metachronous CLM, and more than 1 lesion resected at first stage.

Association Between Geographic Access to Cancer Care and Receipt of Radiation Therapy for Rectal Cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2015-12-17,"Trimodality therapy (chemoradiation and surgery) is the standard of care for stage II/III rectal cancer but nearly one third of patients do not receive radiation therapy (RT). We examined the relationship between the density of radiation oncologists and the travel distance to receipt of RT. A retrospective study based on the National Cancer Data Base identified 26,845 patients aged 18 to 80 years with stage II/III rectal cancer diagnosed from 2007 to 2010. Radiation oncologists were identified through the Physician Compare dataset. Generalized estimating equations clustering by hospital service area was used to examine the association between geographic access and receipt of RT, controlling for patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Of the 26,845 patients, 70% received RT within 180 days of diagnosis or within 90 days of surgery. Compared with a travel distance of <12.5 miles, patients diagnosed at a reporting facility who traveled ≥50 miles had a decreased likelihood of receipt of RT (50-249 miles, adjusted odds ratio 0.75, P<.001; ≥250 miles, adjusted odds ratio 0.46; P=.002), all else being equal. The density level of radiation oncologists was not significantly associated with the receipt of RT. Patients who were female, nonwhite, and aged ≥50 years and had comorbidities were less likely to receive RT (P<.05). Patients who were uninsured but self-paid for their medical services, initially diagnosed elsewhere but treated at a reporting facility, and resided in Midwest had an increased the likelihood of receipt of RT (P<.05). An increased travel burden was associated with a decreased likelihood of receiving RT for patients with stage II/III rectal cancer, all else being equal; however, radiation oncologist density was not.

The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published in Journal of Clinical Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice.A 71-year-old man was seen by his primary care physician for routine evaluation in early 2015. On digital rectal examination, his prostate was moderately enlarged, although he had no obvious areas of palpable disease. His prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 7.1 ng/mL. A standard ultrasound-guided biopsy of his prostate revealed a 60-mL prostate volume and a single core (out of 12) of Gleason 3 + 3 disease. He chose to undergo surveillance. Six months later, his PSA level had risen to 10.0 ng/mL; there was still no palpable disease on digital rectal examination. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of his prostate and pelvis revealed two suspicious intraprostatic lesions with restricted diffusion, focal and earlier enhancement with contrast than adjacent normal prostate, and hypointense features on T2-weighted imaging; these findings were highly suspicious for high-grade prostate cancer (Fig 1). Magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy of each lesion yielded a total of four positive biopsy cores of Gleason 4 + 3 = 7, involving 50% to 80% of each core, with perineural invasion noted. The patient's medical history is notable for overweight (but not morbidly obese), hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, cataract surgeries, and inguinal hernia repair, but the patient is otherwise healthy. He has decided against prostatectomy and brachytherapy because of strong personal preference. In particular, he wanted to avoid anesthesia, and was concerned about the potential for greater urinary incontinence and/or urinary irritation associated with these treatments compared with external-beam radiotherapy (RT).(1,2).",Case Reports,1401.0,1.0,"The Oncology Grand Rounds series is designed to place original reports published in the Journal into clinical context A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges a review of the relevant literature and a summary of the authors suggested management approaches The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies including those published in Journal of Clinical Oncology to patients seen in their own clinical practice.A 71-year-old man was seen by his primary care physician for routine evaluation in early 2015 On digital examination his was moderately enlarged although he had no obvious areas of palpable disease His prostate-specific antigen PSA level was 7.1 ng/mL A standard ultrasound-guided biopsy of his revealed a 60-mL volume and a single core out of 12 of Gleason 3 3 disease He chose to undergo surveillance Six months later his PSA level had risen to 10.0 ng/mL there was still no palpable disease on digital examination Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of his and pelvis revealed two suspicious intraprostatic lesions with restricted diffusion focal and earlier enhancement with contrast than adjacent normal and hypointense features on T2-weighted imaging these findings were highly suspicious for high-grade cancer Fig 1 Magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy of each lesion yielded a total of four positive biopsy cores of Gleason 4 3 7 involving 50 to 80 of each core with perineural invasion noted The patient 's medical history is notable for overweight but not morbidly obese hypercholesterolemia hypertension cataract surgeries and inguinal hernia repair but the patient is otherwise healthy He has decided against prostatectomy and brachytherapy because of strong personal preference In particular he wanted to avoid anesthesia and was concerned about the potential for greater urinary incontinence and/or urinary irritation associated with these treatments compared with external-beam radiotherapy RT 1,2",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[3, 413, 20904, 7001, 988, 16, 1114, 6, 3536, 2279, 1198, 983, 4, 3, 6685, 237, 38, 1533, 8, 473, 1031, 16, 370, 20, 8, 5263, 1, 752, 2, 284, 1427, 8, 206, 1, 3, 867, 789, 2, 8, 1962, 1, 3, 738, 1148, 284, 611, 3, 1326, 1, 26, 988, 16, 6, 987, 5439, 380, 1640, 832, 6, 4930, 3, 99, 1, 825, 94, 141, 135, 983, 4, 6685, 1, 38, 413, 6, 7, 527, 4, 136, 4165, 38, 758, 8, 792, 111, 1095, 3628, 10, 527, 20, 3224, 86, 165, 1473, 9, 1311, 451, 4, 191, 1483, 23, 3271, 1385, 3224, 10, 3508, 7547, 242, 3174, 42, 77, 6228, 1361, 1, 4880, 34, 3224, 1364, 112, 448, 534, 301, 10, 67, 14, 997, 542, 8, 260, 1945, 1808, 411, 1, 3224, 553, 8, 335, 542, 433, 2, 8, 226, 1793, 1205, 1, 133, 1, 1406, 27, 27, 34, 3174, 6177, 6, 1251, 617, 437, 53, 1559, 3224, 534, 301, 42, 16347, 6, 79, 13, 997, 542, 125, 10, 1234, 77, 4880, 34, 23, 3271, 1385, 8347, 1484, 1535, 270, 1, 3224, 2, 3270, 553, 100, 3230, 15469, 406, 5, 2016, 3438, 2137, 2, 1677, 2461, 5, 748, 76, 2086, 295, 2, 22719, 404, 23, 1786, 2337, 270, 46, 272, 11, 561, 3230, 9, 64, 88, 12, 14197, 14, 1484, 1535, 270, 1945, 1212, 238, 411, 1, 296, 1180, 2178, 8, 181, 1, 294, 109, 411, 4357, 1, 1406, 39, 27, 67, 1267, 212, 6, 493, 1, 296, 1793, 5, 4917, 578, 1051, 3, 69, 292, 484, 532, 16, 4090, 9, 3566, 84, 44, 9920, 2209, 12932, 1824, 13871, 5305, 2, 4907, 10236, 972, 84, 3, 69, 16, 2632, 1331, 3174, 71, 10561, 480, 1202, 2, 1536, 408, 1, 1082, 3008, 3863, 4, 1454, 3174, 7931, 6, 3085, 6433, 2, 10, 9415, 545, 3, 174, 9, 378, 1660, 6152, 2, 15, 1660, 11765, 41, 5, 46, 640, 72, 5, 1455, 1345, 310, 240, 14, 18]",2054.0,27001587,32
KRAS and Combined KRAS/TP53 Mutations in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer are Independently Associated with Decreased Response to Neoadjuvant Therapy.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2016-03-28,"The response of rectal cancers to neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT) is variable, but tools to predict response remain lacking. We evaluated whether KRAS and TP53 mutations are associated with pathologic complete response (pCR) and lymph node metastasis after adjusting for neoadjuvant regimen. Retrospective analysis of 229 pretreatment biopsies from patients with stage II/III rectal cancer was performed. All patients received CRT. Patients received 0-8 cycles of FOLFOX either before or after CRT, but prior to surgical excision. A subset was analyzed to assess concordance between mutation calls by Sanger Sequencing and a next-generation assay. A total of 96 tumors (42 %) had KRAS mutation, 150 had TP53 mutation (66 %), and 59 (26 %) had both. Following neoadjuvant therapy, 59 patients (26 %) achieved pCR. Of 133 KRAS wild-type tumors, 45 (34 %) had pCR, compared with 14 of 96 (15 %) KRAS mutant tumors (p = .001). KRAS mutation remained independently associated with a lower pCR rate on multivariable analysis after adjusting for clinical stage, CRT-to-surgery interval and cycles of FOLFOX (OR 0.34; 95 % CI 0.17-0.66, p < .01). Of 29 patients with KRAS G12V or G13D, only 2 (7 %) achieved pCR. Tumors with both KRAS and TP53 mutation were associated with lymph node metastasis.

Long-Term Bone Marrow Suppression During Postoperative Chemotherapy in Rectal Cancer Patients After Preoperative Chemoradiation Therapy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2016-01-05,"To quantify ensuing bone marrow (BM) suppression during postoperative chemotherapy resulting from preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) therapy for rectal cancer. We retrospectively evaluated 35 patients treated with preoperative CRT followed by postoperative 5-Fluorouracil and oxaliplatin (OxF) chemotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer. The pelvic bone marrow (PBM) was divided into ilium (IBM), lower pelvis (LPBM), and lumbosacrum (LSBM). Dose volume histograms (DVH) measured the mean doses and percentage of BM volume receiving between 5-40 Gy (i.e.: PBM-V5, LPBM-V5). The Wilcoxon signed rank tests evaluated the differences in absolute hematologic nadirs during neoadjuvant vs. adjuvant treatment. Logistic regressions evaluated the association between dosimetric parameters and ≥ grade 3 hematologic toxicity (HT3) and hematologic event (HE) defined as ≥ grade 2 HT and a dose reduction in OxF. Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to determine optimal threshold values leading to HT3. During OxF chemotherapy, 40.0% (n=14) and 48% (n=17) of rectal cancer patients experienced HT3 and HE, respectively. On multivariable logistic regression, increasing pelvic mean dose (PMD) and lower pelvis mean dose (LPMD) along with increasing PBM-V (25-40), LPBM-V25, and LPBM-V40 were significantly associated with HT3 and/or HE during postoperative chemotherapy. Exceeding ≥36.6 Gy to the PMD and ≥32.6 Gy to the LPMD strongly correlated with causing HT3 during postoperative chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant RT for rectal cancer has lasting effects on the pelvic BM, which are demonstrable during adjuvant OxF. Sparing of the BM during preoperative CRT can aid in reducing significant hematologic adverse events and aid in tolerance of postoperative chemotherapy.",Journal Article,1477.0,18.0,To quantify ensuing marrow BM suppression during postoperative chemotherapy resulting from preoperative chemoradiation CRT therapy for cancer We retrospectively evaluated 35 patients treated with preoperative CRT followed by postoperative 5-Fluorouracil and oxaliplatin OxF chemotherapy for locally advanced cancer The pelvic marrow PBM was divided into ilium IBM lower pelvis LPBM and lumbosacrum LSBM Dose volume histograms DVH measured the mean doses and percentage of BM volume receiving between 5-40 Gy i.e PBM-V5 LPBM-V5 The Wilcoxon signed rank tests evaluated the differences in absolute hematologic nadirs during neoadjuvant vs. adjuvant treatment Logistic regressions evaluated the association between dosimetric parameters and ≥ grade 3 hematologic toxicity HT3 and hematologic event HE defined as ≥ grade 2 HT and a dose reduction in OxF Receiver Operator Characteristic ROC curves were constructed to determine optimal threshold values leading to HT3 During OxF chemotherapy 40.0 n=14 and 48 n=17 of cancer patients experienced HT3 and HE respectively On multivariable logistic regression increasing pelvic mean dose PMD and lower pelvis mean dose LPMD along with increasing PBM-V 25-40 LPBM-V25 and LPBM-V40 were significantly associated with HT3 and/or HE during postoperative chemotherapy Exceeding ≥36.6 Gy to the PMD and ≥32.6 Gy to the LPMD strongly correlated with causing HT3 during postoperative chemotherapy Neoadjuvant RT for cancer has lasting effects on the pelvic BM which are demonstrable during adjuvant OxF Sparing of the BM during preoperative CRT can aid in reducing significant hematologic adverse events and aid in tolerance of postoperative chemotherapy,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[6, 3091, 11937, 581, 1246, 1332, 190, 573, 56, 1113, 29, 498, 975, 1089, 36, 9, 12, 21, 894, 194, 465, 7, 73, 5, 498, 1089, 370, 20, 573, 33, 1404, 2, 1476, 36214, 56, 9, 795, 131, 12, 3, 1110, 581, 9215, 10, 2176, 237, 18295, 27522, 280, 3270, 36215, 2, 67895, 32583, 61, 433, 8638, 8255, 644, 3, 313, 415, 2, 1150, 1, 1246, 433, 357, 59, 33, 327, 381, 70, 563, 9215, 10234, 36215, 10234, 3, 3896, 7717, 1026, 895, 194, 3, 362, 4, 1766, 813, 13866, 190, 536, 105, 249, 24, 812, 5142, 194, 3, 248, 59, 3187, 1038, 2, 749, 88, 27, 813, 155, 10611, 2, 813, 774, 3174, 395, 22, 749, 88, 18, 3152, 2, 8, 61, 628, 4, 36214, 3185, 9028, 2037, 3783, 2400, 11, 2776, 6, 223, 665, 2390, 1030, 1049, 6, 10611, 190, 36214, 56, 327, 13, 78, 213, 2, 576, 78, 269, 1, 12, 7, 592, 10611, 2, 3174, 106, 23, 658, 812, 320, 602, 1110, 313, 61, 11216, 2, 280, 3270, 313, 61, 49650, 1510, 5, 602, 9215, 603, 243, 327, 36215, 18652, 2, 36215, 12454, 11, 97, 41, 5, 10611, 2, 15, 3174, 190, 573, 56, 5178, 25308, 49, 381, 6, 3, 11216, 2, 67896, 49, 381, 6, 3, 49650, 1327, 438, 5, 3440, 10611, 190, 573, 56, 536, 240, 9, 12, 71, 3443, 176, 23, 3, 1110, 1246, 92, 32, 11411, 190, 249, 36214, 1851, 1, 3, 1246, 190, 498, 1089, 122, 2427, 4, 1818, 93, 813, 290, 281, 2, 2427, 4, 2614, 1, 573, 56]",1688.0,27026312,611
Oncologic and Functional Hazards of Obesity Among Patients With Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer Following Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation Therapy.,American journal of clinical oncology,Am. J. Clin. Oncol.,2017-06-01,"Obesity is a major health concern and risk factor for colorectal cancer that may also impact cancer treatment and outcomes. Rectal cancer response to chemoradiotherapy (CXRT) is associated with long-term survival and sphincter preservation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of obesity on treatment outcomes after neoadjuvant CXRT for rectal cancer. A retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed (1993 to 2010) with cT3-4 or cN+ (by endorectal ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging) rectal carcinoma and treated with CXRT and total mesorectal excision was performed. Patients were classified as obese (body mass index ≥30 kg/m) or nonobese (body mass index <30 kg/m), and by response to CXRT: complete (pCR) or incomplete (pIR). Associations between obesity, tumor response, and sphincter preservation were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis and survival outcomes by Cox regression. A total of 753 patients met criteria and 28.7% (n=216) patients were obese. Obese and nonobese groups did not differ in age, sex, tumor location, grade, or number of examined lymph nodes. However, obesity was associated with a lower rate of pCR (ORmulti=0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.94; P=0.04) and among mid to low rectal cancer patients, a lower rate of sphincter preservation (ORmulti=0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.99). Among both obese and nonobese patients, CR was associated with more favorable recurrence-free survival than pIR. Considering the increasing obesity prevalence and its association with CXRT response, oncologic outcomes, and sphincter preservation, further study is needed regarding the impact of obesity on neoadjuvant treatment response. Moreover, obesity should be targeted as a modifiable risk factor for adverse outcomes following multimodality treatment for rectal cancer.",Journal Article,964.0,4.0,Obesity is a major health concern and risk factor for cancer that may also impact cancer treatment and outcomes cancer response to chemoradiotherapy CXRT is associated with long-term survival and sphincter preservation The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of obesity on treatment outcomes after neoadjuvant CXRT for cancer A retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed 1993 to 2010 with cT3-4 or cN+ by endorectal ultrasound computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging carcinoma and treated with CXRT and total mesorectal excision was performed Patients were classified as obese body mass index ≥30 kg/m or nonobese body mass index 30 kg/m and by response to CXRT complete pCR or incomplete pIR Associations between obesity tumor response and sphincter preservation were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis and survival outcomes by Cox regression A total of 753 patients met criteria and 28.7 n=216 patients were obese Obese and nonobese groups did not differ in age sex tumor location grade or number of examined lymph nodes However obesity was associated with a lower rate of pCR ORmulti=0.60 95 confidence interval 0.38-0.94 P=0.04 and among mid to low cancer patients a lower rate of sphincter preservation ORmulti=0.67 95 confidence interval 0.45-0.99 Among both obese and nonobese patients CR was associated with more favorable recurrence-free survival than pIR Considering the increasing obesity prevalence and its association with CXRT response oncologic outcomes and sphincter preservation further study is needed regarding the impact of obesity on neoadjuvant treatment response Moreover obesity should be targeted as a modifiable risk factor for adverse outcomes following multimodality treatment for cancer,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[1661, 16, 8, 458, 341, 2893, 2, 43, 161, 9, 12, 17, 68, 120, 345, 12, 24, 2, 123, 12, 51, 6, 1464, 7925, 16, 41, 5, 319, 337, 25, 2, 5400, 2224, 3, 743, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 376, 3, 345, 1, 1661, 23, 24, 123, 50, 536, 7925, 9, 12, 8, 459, 180, 45, 1, 7, 265, 3343, 6, 1120, 5, 11036, 39, 15, 3183, 20, 5615, 1945, 1220, 872, 15, 1484, 1535, 270, 134, 2, 73, 5, 7925, 2, 181, 5823, 1366, 10, 173, 7, 11, 1373, 22, 2209, 642, 782, 558, 7783, 503, 188, 15, 8952, 642, 782, 558, 201, 503, 188, 2, 20, 51, 6, 7925, 236, 604, 15, 2610, 15567, 685, 59, 1661, 30, 51, 2, 5400, 2224, 11, 194, 75, 331, 812, 320, 65, 2, 25, 123, 20, 418, 320, 8, 181, 1, 13401, 7, 543, 371, 2, 339, 67, 78, 6287, 7, 11, 2209, 2209, 2, 8952, 271, 205, 44, 1505, 4, 89, 1035, 30, 1147, 88, 15, 207, 1, 409, 263, 502, 137, 1661, 10, 41, 5, 8, 280, 116, 1, 604, 49651, 13, 335, 48, 307, 268, 13, 519, 13, 960, 19, 13, 755, 2, 107, 4863, 6, 154, 12, 7, 8, 280, 116, 1, 5400, 2224, 49651, 13, 598, 48, 307, 268, 13, 512, 13, 1058, 107, 110, 2209, 2, 8952, 7, 684, 10, 41, 5, 80, 913, 146, 115, 25, 76, 15567, 3075, 3, 602, 1661, 1078, 2, 211, 248, 5, 7925, 51, 1998, 123, 2, 5400, 2224, 195, 45, 16, 575, 666, 3, 345, 1, 1661, 23, 536, 24, 51, 1393, 1661, 257, 40, 238, 22, 8, 5222, 43, 161, 9, 290, 123, 366, 2425, 24, 9, 12]",1767.0,27028350,335
Body mass index and risk of colorectal cancer according to tumor lymphocytic infiltrate.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2016-05-10,"Higher body mass index (BMI), higher body adiposity and obesity have been associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer. Evidence suggests that excess energy balance may influence systemic immune and inflammatory status. Thus, we hypothesized that the positive association between BMI and colorectal cancer risk might differ according to colorectal carcinoma subtypes according to levels of histopathological lymphocytic reaction to tumor. We collected biennial questionnaire data on weight and baseline height information in two prospective cohort studies, the Nurses' Health Study (1980-2010) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2010). Utilizing duplication-method Cox proportional hazards regression models, we prospectively assessed the association between BMI and risk of colorectal cancer subtypes according to the degree of Crohn's-like lymphoid reaction, peritumoral lymphocytic reaction, intratumoral periglandular reaction, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, the overall lymphocytic reaction score, or T-cell [CD3(+) , CD8(+) , CD45RO (PTPRC)(+) or FOXP3(+) ] density in tumor tissue. Statistical significance level was adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing by Bonferroni correction.

BRAFV600E Mutations in High-Grade Colorectal Neuroendocrine Tumors May Predict Responsiveness to BRAF-MEK Combination Therapy.,Cancer discovery,Cancer Discov,2016-04-05,"Neuroendocrine tumors comprise a heterogeneous group of malignancies with a broad spectrum of clinical behavior. Poorly differentiated tumors follow an aggressive course with limited treatment options, and new approaches are needed. Oncogenic BRAF V600E (BRAF(V600E)) substitutions are observed primarily in melanoma, colon cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer, but have been identified in multiple tumor types. Here, we describe the first reported recurrent BRAF(V600E) mutations in advanced high-grade colorectal neuroendocrine tumors and identify a BRAF alteration frequency of 9% in 108 cases. Among these BRAF alterations, 80% were BRAF(V600E) Dramatic response to BRAF-MEK combination therapy occurred in two cases of metastatic high-grade rectal neuroendocrine carcinoma refractory to standard therapy. Urinary BRAF(V600E) circulating tumor DNA monitoring paralleled disease response. Our series represents the largest study of genomic profiling in colorectal neuroendocrine tumors and provides strong evidence that BRAF(V600E) is an oncogenic driver responsive to BRAF-MEK combination therapy in this molecular subset. BRAF(V600E) is an established oncogenic driver, but significant disparities in response exist among tumor types. Two patients with treatment-refractory high-grade colorectal neuroendocrine tumors harboring BRAF(V600E) exhibited rapid and durable response to combined BRAF-MEK inhibition, providing the first clinical evidence of efficacy in this aggressive tumor type.

Rectal Cancer: Assessment of Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation Outcome based on Radiomics of Multiparametric MRI.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2016-05-16,"To evaluate multiparametric MRI features in predicting pathologic response after preoperative chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Forty-eight consecutive patients (January 2012-November 2014) receiving neoadjuvant CRT were enrolled. All underwent anatomical T1/T2, diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI before CRT. A total of 103 imaging features, analyzed using both volume-averaged and voxelized methods, were extracted for each patient. Univariate analyses were performed to evaluate the capability of each individual parameter in predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) or good response (GR) evaluated based on tumor regression grade. Artificial neural network with 4-fold validation technique was further utilized to select the best predictor sets to classify different response groups and the predictive performance was calculated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The conventional volume-averaged analysis could provide an area under ROC curve (AUC) ranging from 0.54 to 0.73 in predicting pCR. While if the models were replaced by voxelized heterogeneity analysis, the prediction accuracy measured by AUC could be improved to 0.71-0.79. Similar results were found for GR prediction. In addition, each subcategory images could generate moderate power in predicting the response, which if combining all information together, the AUC could be further improved to 0.84 for pCR and 0.89 for GR prediction, respectively.

Owing to this regimen, patients with locally advanced rectal cancer have better survival rates than patients with colon cancer, but at the cost of substantial morbidity and reduced quality of life. The challenge is to identify treatment approaches that maintain or even improve oncologic outcomes while preserving quality of life. We have identified different tumor characteristics that are associated with recurrence and probability of survival for locally advanced rectal cancer. This risk stratification, based on baseline clinical staging and tumor response to chemoradiotherapy, has led us to question whether all patients with locally advanced rectal cancer require every component of the multimodal regimen.

Development of The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons' Rectal Cancer Surgery Checklist.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2016-07-01,"There is excellent evidence that surgical safety checklists contribute to decreased morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study was to develop a surgical checklist composed of the key phases of care for patients with rectal cancer. A consensus-oriented decision-making model involving iterative input from subject matter experts under the auspices of The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons was designed. The study was conducted through meetings and discussion to consensus. Patient data were extracted from an initial literature review.

For locally advanced tumors (i.e., T3-4 and/or node positive), the very high rate of local and distant recurrences has necessitated a standard adjuvant regimen of preoperative chemoradiation and postoperative chemotherapy. Several controversies regarding this approach remain, including the technique and fractionation scheme of radiation therapy prior to surgery, the choice of concomitant chemotherapy, and whether all patients require postoperative systemic therapy. Furthermore, in an era of improving staging imaging and surgical techniques, an opportunity for de-escalation of therapy to improve patient morbidity and quality of life may arise.

We aimed to delineate the impact of dMMR on prognosis, the predicted response to fluoropyrimidine-based neoadjuvant therapy, and implications of germline alterations in the MMR genes in rectal cancer. Between 1992 and 2012, 62 patients with dMMR rectal cancers underwent multimodality therapy. Oncologic treatment and outcomes as well as clinical genetics work-up were examined. Overall and rectal cancer-specific survival were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The median age at diagnosis was 41 years. MMR deficiency was most commonly due to alterations in MSH2 (53%) or MSH6 (23%). After a median follow-up of 6.8 years, the 5-year rectal cancer-specific survival was 100% for stage I and II, 85.1% for stage III, and 60.0% for stage IV disease.

"Impact of sex, age, and ethnicity/race on the survival of patients with rectal cancer in the United States from 1988 to 2012.",Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2016-08-01,"Most studies report on colon and rectal cancers collectively, even though biologic and prognostic differences exist between these disease entities. Here, we investigated the effects of sex, age, and ethnicity/race on rectal cancer (RC) mortality by stage focusing on differences before and after 2004.Using the SEER database, we identified 105,511 patients diagnosed with RC from 1988-2012. Main outcomes were disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS).In patients with stage I-III RC, women achieved a longer DSS (HR 0.87, P < 0.001) than men, independent of age, from 1988-2012. In stage IV disease, the sex disparity favoring women was limited to the age 18-44 yr cohort (DSS HR 0.79, P < 0.001). The sex difference in DSS (Pinteraction = 0.009) was significantly reduced from 2004 to 2012 across all ages. Hispanics and Native Americans with locoregional RC had inferior DSS relative to Whites from 1988-2003, but these differences were not evident from 2004-2012 (Pinteraction = 0.001). Additionally, Asians with stage I-III RC had superior DSS from 2004 on compared to Whites.

Regular Aspirin Use Associates With Lower Risk of Colorectal Cancers With Low Numbers of Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes.,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,2016-07-27,"Aspirin use reduces colorectal cancer risk. Aspirin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, inhibits prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2 or cyclooxygenase-2); PTGS2 promotes inflammation and suppresses T-cell-mediated adaptive immunity. We investigated whether the inverse association of aspirin use with colorectal carcinoma risk was stronger for tumors with lower degrees of lymphocytic infiltrates than for tumors with higher degrees of lymphocytic infiltrates. We collected aspirin use data biennially from participants in the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Participants were asked whether they took aspirin in most weeks, the number of tablets taken per week, and years of aspirin use. We collected available tumor specimens (n = 1458) from pathology laboratories in the United States. A pathologist confirmed the diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma (excluding anal squamous cell carcinoma), and evaluated histopathology features, including patterns and degrees of lymphocytic infiltrates within and around tumor areas. Person-years of follow-up evaluation were accrued from the date of return of questionnaires until dates of colorectal cancer diagnosis, death, or the end of follow-up evaluation (June 2010). Duplication-method Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the association of aspirin with the incidence of colorectal carcinoma subgroups according to the degree of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), intratumoral periglandular reaction, peritumoral reaction, or Crohn's-like reaction. We documented 1458 rectal and colon cancers. The inverse association between regular aspirin use and colorectal cancer risk significantly differed by concentrations of TILs (P<sub>heterogeneity</sub> = .007). Compared with nonregular use, regular aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of tumors that had low levels of TILs (relative risk, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.81), and strength of the association depended on aspirin dose and duration (both P<sub>trend</sub> < .001). In contrast, aspirin use was not associated with a risk of tumors having intermediate or high levels of TILs. This differential association was consistent regardless of the status of tumor microsatellite instability, mutations in BRAF, or expression of PTGS2. Regular aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of tumors that contained low levels of CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, or CD45RO (PTPRC)<sup>+</sup> T cells (measured by immunohistochemistry and computer-assisted image analysis). Based on data from the prospective cohort studies, regular use of aspirin is associated with a lower risk of colorectal carcinomas with low concentrations of TILs. These findings indicate that the immune response in the tumor microenvironment could be involved in the chemopreventive effects of aspirin.",Journal Article,1273.0,31.0,Aspirin use reduces cancer risk Aspirin a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug inhibits prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 PTGS2 or cyclooxygenase-2 PTGS2 promotes inflammation and suppresses T-cell-mediated adaptive immunity We investigated whether the inverse association of aspirin use with carcinoma risk was stronger for tumors with lower degrees of lymphocytic infiltrates than for tumors with higher degrees of lymphocytic infiltrates We collected aspirin use data biennially from participants in the Nurses Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study Participants were asked whether they took aspirin in most weeks the number of tablets taken per week and years of aspirin use We collected available tumor specimens n 1458 from pathology laboratories in the United States A pathologist confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma excluding squamous cell carcinoma and evaluated histopathology features including patterns and degrees of lymphocytic infiltrates within and around tumor areas Person-years of follow-up evaluation were accrued from the date of return of questionnaires until dates of cancer diagnosis death or the end of follow-up evaluation June 2010 Duplication-method Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the association of aspirin with the incidence of carcinoma subgroups according to the degree of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes TILs intratumoral periglandular reaction peritumoral reaction or Crohn's-like reaction We documented 1458 and cancers The inverse association between regular aspirin use and cancer risk significantly differed by concentrations of TILs P sub heterogeneity /sub .007 Compared with nonregular use regular aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of tumors that had low levels of TILs relative risk 0.72 95 confidence interval 0.63-0.81 and strength of the association depended on aspirin dose and duration both P sub trend /sub .001 In contrast aspirin use was not associated with a risk of tumors having intermediate or high levels of TILs This differential association was consistent regardless of the status of tumor microsatellite instability mutations in BRAF or expression of PTGS2 Regular aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of tumors that contained low levels of CD3 sup /sup T cells CD8 sup /sup T cells or CD45RO PTPRC sup /sup T cells measured by immunohistochemistry and computer-assisted image analysis Based on data from the prospective cohort studies regular use of aspirin is associated with a lower risk of carcinomas with low concentrations of TILs These findings indicate that the immune response in the tumor microenvironment could be involved in the chemopreventive effects of aspirin,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[2085, 119, 2389, 12, 43, 2085, 8, 4960, 312, 1291, 234, 1576, 6068, 21561, 3522, 18, 8011, 15, 4043, 18, 8011, 2148, 1815, 2, 4079, 102, 31, 517, 2454, 1604, 21, 565, 317, 3, 2931, 248, 1, 2085, 119, 5, 134, 43, 10, 3355, 9, 57, 5, 280, 4133, 1, 1193, 5942, 76, 9, 57, 5, 142, 4133, 1, 1193, 5942, 21, 786, 2085, 119, 74, 16300, 29, 776, 4, 3, 2707, 341, 45, 2, 341, 3409, 166, 126, 45, 776, 11, 3732, 317, 491, 5060, 2085, 4, 96, 244, 3, 207, 1, 6675, 1633, 379, 647, 2, 60, 1, 2085, 119, 21, 786, 390, 30, 623, 78, 28192, 29, 1117, 4884, 4, 3, 1088, 907, 8, 5093, 557, 3, 147, 1, 449, 3207, 691, 31, 134, 2, 194, 3831, 404, 141, 764, 2, 4133, 1, 1193, 5942, 262, 2, 3337, 30, 1361, 2719, 60, 1, 166, 126, 451, 11, 3198, 29, 3, 1244, 1, 4656, 1, 2956, 1100, 9561, 1, 12, 147, 273, 15, 3, 396, 1, 166, 126, 451, 1924, 1120, 4616, 596, 418, 831, 1017, 320, 10, 95, 6, 423, 3, 248, 1, 2085, 5, 3, 287, 1, 134, 1453, 768, 6, 3, 1444, 1, 30, 2097, 1594, 3740, 2074, 21582, 1329, 5432, 1329, 15, 23387, 733, 1329, 21, 1405, 28192, 2, 163, 3, 2931, 248, 59, 3316, 2085, 119, 2, 12, 43, 97, 2512, 20, 1003, 1, 3740, 19, 551, 1144, 551, 1999, 72, 5, 18952, 119, 3316, 2085, 119, 10, 41, 5, 8, 280, 43, 1, 57, 17, 42, 154, 148, 1, 3740, 580, 43, 13, 720, 48, 307, 268, 13, 676, 13, 865, 2, 3671, 1, 3, 248, 9020, 23, 2085, 61, 2, 654, 110, 19, 551, 853, 551, 144, 4, 748, 2085, 119, 10, 44, 41, 5, 8, 43, 1, 57, 1041, 919, 15, 64, 148, 1, 3740, 26, 1777, 248, 10, 925, 1583, 1, 3, 156, 1, 30, 2226, 1753, 138, 4, 566, 15, 55, 1, 8011, 3316, 2085, 119, 10, 41, 5, 8, 280, 43, 1, 57, 17, 3070, 154, 148, 1, 3117, 172, 172, 102, 37, 968, 172, 172, 102, 37, 15, 11469, 21632, 172, 172, 102, 37, 644, 20, 888, 2, 4236, 2927, 1482, 65, 90, 23, 74, 29, 3, 482, 180, 94, 3316, 119, 1, 2085, 16, 41, 5, 8, 280, 43, 1, 826, 5, 154, 1003, 1, 3740, 46, 272, 1008, 17, 3, 250, 51, 4, 3, 30, 995, 359, 40, 646, 4, 3, 4401, 176, 1, 2085]",2699.0,27475305,60
International consensus guidelines on Clinical Target Volume delineation in rectal cancer.,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,Radiother Oncol,2016-08-12,"The delineation of Clinical Target Volume (CTV) is a critical step in radiotherapy. Several guidelines suggest different subvolumes and anatomical boundaries in rectal cancer (RC), potentially leading to a misunderstanding in the CTV definition. International consensus guidelines (CG) are needed to improve uniformity in RC CTV delineation. The 7 radiation oncologist experts defined a roadmap to produce RC CG. Step 1: revision of the published guidelines. Step 2: selection of RC cases with different clinical stages. Step 3: delineation of cases using Falcon following previously published guidelines. Step 4: meeting in person to discuss the initial delineation outcome, followed by a CTV proposal based on revised and if needed, adapted anatomical boundaries. Step 5: peer review of the agreed consensus. Step 6: peer review meeting to validate the final outcome. Step 7: completion of RC delineation atlases. A new ontology of structure sets was defined and the related table of anatomical boundaries was generated. The major modifications were about the lateral lymph nodes and the ischio-rectal fossa delineation. Seven RC cases were made available online as consultation atlases.

"Prognostic Significance of Digital Rectal Examination and Prostate Specific Antigen in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Arm.",The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2016-08-26,"The absence of definitive data or explicit guidelines regarding the use of digital rectal examination for prostate cancer screening may lead to confusion for physicians and patients alike. We evaluated the prognostic value of abnormal digital rectal examination and prostate specific antigen following the widespread dissemination of prostate specific antigen testing in the U.S. Collectively, men comprising the screening arm of the PLCO cancer screening trial who underwent digital rectal examination screening (35,350) were followed for 314,033 person-years. Adjusted analyses with competing risks regression were performed to assess the association of suspicious (nodularity, induration, asymmetry) digital rectal examination and abnormal prostate specific antigen (4 ng/ml or greater) with the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer, prostate cancer specific mortality and overall mortality. Among all screening encounters with a suspicious digital rectal examination only 15.4% had a concurrently abnormal prostate specific antigen (McNemar's test p <0.001). During followup there were 1,612 clinically significant prostate cancers detected, 64 prostate cancer specific deaths and 4,600 deaths.

Distance to the anal verge is associated with pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant therapy in locally advanced rectal cancer.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2016-09-19,"Achieving a pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant therapy has been associated with better prognosis in rectal cancer patients. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between distance to the anal verge (DTAV) and pCR. Review of a prospectively maintained database of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who received neoadjuvant treatment was completed. Uni- and multivariate analysis assessed the association between DTAV and pCR after neoadjuvant therapy. Of 827 included patients, 20% had a pCR. We found that pCR rates were 11% for tumors <4 cm, 24% for tumors 4-6 cm, 30% for tumors at 6-8 cm, 17% for tumors 8-10 cm, and 14% for tumors >10 cm from the anal verge (P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis also showed a strong association between DTAV and pCR (P = 0.008). The bimodal distribution of pCR resulted in a lower odds ratio of pCR for tumors <4 and >8 cm from the anal verge. Patients with low tumors (<4 cm) and higher tumors (>8 cm), were less likely to have a pCR. Further investigation is warranted to determine if these observations are related to tumor biology or possibly differences in radiation technique. J. Surg.

Multinational Prospective Study of Patient-Reported Outcomes After Prostate Radiation Therapy: Detailed Assessment of Rectal Bleeding.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2016-08-03,"The new short Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP) patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) tool has removed the rectal bleeding question from the previous much longer version, EPIC-26. Herein, we assess the impact of losing the dedicated rectal bleeding question in 2 independent prospective multicenter cohorts. In a prospective multicenter test cohort (n=865), EPIC-26 patient-reported HRQOL data were collected for 2 years after treatment from patients treated with prostate radiation therapy from 2003 to 2011. A second prospective multicenter cohort (n=442) was used for independent validation. A repeated-effects model was used to predict the change from baseline in bowel summary scores from longer EPIC instruments using the change in EPIC-CP bowel summary scores with and without rectal bleeding scores. Two years after radiation therapy, 91% of patients were free of bleeding, and only 2.6% reported bothersome bleeding problems. Correlations between EPIC-26 and EPIC-CP bowel scores were very high (r<sup>2</sup>=0.90-0.96) and were statistically improved with the addition of rectal bleeding information (r<sup>2</sup>=0.94-0.98). Considering all patients, only 0.2% of patients in the test cohort and 0.7% in the validation cohort reported bothersome bleeding and had clinically relevant HRQOL changes missed with EPIC-CP. However, of the 2.6% (n=17) of men with bothersome rectal bleeding in the test cohort, EPIC-CP failed to capture 1 patient (6%) as experiencing meaningful declines in bowel HRQOL. Modern prostate radiation therapy results in exceptionally low rates of bothersome rectal bleeding, and <1% of patients experience bothersome bleeding and are not captured by EPIC-CP as having meaningful HRQOL declines after radiation therapy. However, in the small subset of patients with bothersome rectal bleeding, the longer EPIC-26 should strongly be considered, given its superior performance in this patient subset.",Journal Article,1266.0,5.0,The new short Expanded Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice EPIC-CP patient-reported health-related quality of life HRQOL tool has removed the bleeding question from the previous much longer version EPIC-26 Herein we assess the impact of losing the dedicated bleeding question in 2 independent prospective multicenter cohorts In a prospective multicenter test cohort n=865 EPIC-26 patient-reported HRQOL data were collected for 2 years after treatment from patients treated with radiation therapy from 2003 to 2011 A second prospective multicenter cohort n=442 was used for independent validation A repeated-effects model was used to predict the change from baseline in bowel summary scores from longer EPIC instruments using the change in EPIC-CP bowel summary scores with and without bleeding scores Two years after radiation therapy 91 of patients were free of bleeding and only 2.6 reported bothersome bleeding problems Correlations between EPIC-26 and EPIC-CP bowel scores were very high r sup 2 /sup =0.90-0.96 and were statistically improved with the addition of bleeding information r sup 2 /sup =0.94-0.98 Considering all patients only 0.2 of patients in the test cohort and 0.7 in the validation cohort reported bothersome bleeding and had clinically relevant HRQOL changes missed with EPIC-CP However of the 2.6 n=17 of men with bothersome bleeding in the test cohort EPIC-CP failed to capture 1 patient 6 as experiencing meaningful declines in bowel HRQOL Modern radiation therapy results in exceptionally low rates of bothersome bleeding and 1 of patients experience bothersome bleeding and are not captured by EPIC-CP as having meaningful HRQOL declines after radiation therapy However in the small subset of patients with bothersome bleeding the longer EPIC-26 should strongly be considered given its superior performance in this patient subset,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[3, 217, 978, 2064, 12, 558, 3308, 9, 38, 758, 8995, 2541, 69, 210, 341, 139, 372, 1, 358, 2534, 1515, 71, 2264, 3, 2294, 2840, 29, 3, 698, 1802, 589, 2256, 8995, 432, 1986, 21, 423, 3, 345, 1, 13705, 3, 4827, 2294, 2840, 4, 18, 306, 482, 1570, 736, 4, 8, 482, 1570, 412, 180, 78, 13419, 8995, 432, 69, 210, 2534, 74, 11, 786, 9, 18, 60, 50, 24, 29, 7, 73, 5, 121, 36, 29, 1522, 6, 1132, 8, 419, 482, 1570, 180, 78, 12186, 10, 95, 9, 306, 929, 8, 2113, 176, 202, 10, 95, 6, 678, 3, 707, 29, 330, 4, 1659, 1962, 703, 29, 589, 8995, 4730, 75, 3, 707, 4, 8995, 2541, 1659, 1962, 703, 5, 2, 187, 2294, 703, 100, 60, 50, 121, 36, 970, 1, 7, 11, 115, 1, 2294, 2, 158, 18, 49, 210, 14768, 2294, 2408, 2553, 59, 8995, 432, 2, 8995, 2541, 1659, 703, 11, 923, 64, 668, 172, 18, 172, 13, 424, 13, 921, 2, 11, 712, 231, 5, 3, 352, 1, 2294, 487, 668, 172, 18, 172, 13, 960, 13, 1096, 3075, 62, 7, 158, 13, 18, 1, 7, 4, 3, 412, 180, 2, 13, 67, 4, 3, 929, 180, 210, 14768, 2294, 2, 42, 505, 867, 2534, 400, 5149, 5, 8995, 2541, 137, 1, 3, 18, 49, 78, 269, 1, 325, 5, 14768, 2294, 4, 3, 412, 180, 8995, 2541, 1551, 6, 2891, 14, 69, 49, 22, 2985, 2538, 4264, 4, 1659, 2534, 2366, 121, 36, 99, 4, 13854, 154, 151, 1, 14768, 2294, 2, 14, 1, 7, 730, 14768, 2294, 2, 32, 44, 4954, 20, 8995, 2541, 22, 1041, 2538, 2534, 4264, 50, 121, 36, 137, 4, 3, 302, 697, 1, 7, 5, 14768, 2294, 3, 589, 8995, 432, 257, 1327, 40, 515, 447, 211, 1123, 528, 4, 26, 69, 697]",1867.0,27663760,63
"MicroRNA let-7, T Cells, and Patient Survival in Colorectal Cancer.",Cancer immunology research,Cancer Immunol Res,2016-10-13,"Experimental evidence suggests that the let-7 family of noncoding RNAs suppresses adaptive immune responses, contributing to immune evasion by the tumor. We hypothesized that the amount of let-7a and let-7b expression in colorectal carcinoma might be associated with limited T-lymphocyte infiltrates in the tumor microenvironment and worse clinical outcome. Utilizing the molecular pathological epidemiology resources of 795 rectal and colon cancers in two U.S.-nationwide prospective cohort studies, we measured tumor-associated let-7a and let-7b expression levels by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR, and CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, CD45RO (PTPRC)<sup>+</sup>, and FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cell densities by tumor tissue microarray immunohistochemistry and computer-assisted image analysis. Logistic regression analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to assess associations of let-7a (and let-7b) expression (quartile predictor variables) with T-cell densities (binary outcome variables) and mortality, respectively, controlling for tumor molecular features, including microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, LINE-1 methylation, and KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations. Compared with cases in the lowest quartile of let-7a expression, those in the highest quartile were associated with lower densities of CD3<sup>+</sup> [multivariate odds ratio (OR), 0.40; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.23-0.67; P<sub>trend</sub> = 0.003] and CD45RO<sup>+</sup> cells (multivariate OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.17-0.58; P<sub>trend</sub> = 0.0004), and higher colorectal cancer-specific mortality (multivariate hazard ratio, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.42-3.13; P<sub>trend</sub> = 0.001).

Effect of increasing radiation dose on pathologic complete response in rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy.,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",Acta Oncol,2016-10-20,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) increases pathological complete response (pCR) rates compared to radiotherapy alone in patients with stage II-III rectal cancer. Limited evidence addresses whether radiotherapy dose escalation further improves pCR rates. Our purpose is to measure the effects of radiotherapy dose and other factors on post-therapy pathologic tumor (ypT) and nodal stage in rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant CRT followed by mesorectal excision. A non-randomized comparative effectiveness analysis was performed of rectal cancer patients treated in 2000-2013 from the National Oncology Data Alliance™ (NODA), a pooled database of cancer registries from >150 US hospitals. The NODA contains the same data submitted to state cancer registries and SEER combined with validated radiotherapy and chemotherapy records. Eligible patients were treated with neoadjuvant CRT followed by proctectomy and had complete data on treatment start dates, radiotherapy dose, clinical tumor (cT) and ypT stage, and number of positive nodes at surgery (n = 3298 patients). Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the predictive value of independent variables on achieving a pCR. On multivariable regression, radiotherapy dose, cT stage, and time interval between CRT and surgery were significant predictors of achieving a pCR. After adjusting for the effect of other variates, patients treated with higher radiotherapy doses were also more likely to have negative nodes at surgery and be downstaged from cT3-T4 and/or node positive disease to ypT0-T2N0 after neoadjuvant CRT.

The study reviewed the medical records of all patients treated at our institution from August 2009 to October 2014 who received robotically assisted laparoscopic OT for rectal or anal cancer before RT. Clinical and hormonal data were abstracted to determine ovarian function. The study identified 22 women with rectal (n = 20) or anal (n = 2) cancer. The median age of the women was 39 years (range 26-45 years). For one patient, OT was technically not feasible. The postoperative course was uneventful in all but one case. Follow-up data on ovarian function were unavailable for 3 patients.

Prostate deformation from inflatable rectal probe cover and dosimetric effects in prostate seed implant brachytherapy.,Medical physics,Med Phys,2016-12-01,"Prostate brachytherapy is an important treatment technique for patients with localized prostate cancer. An inflatable rectal ultrasound probe cover is frequently utilized during the procedure to adjust for unfavorable prostate position relative to the implant grid. However, the inflated cover causes prostate deformation, which is not accounted for during dosimetric planning. Most of the therapeutic dose is delivered after the procedure when the prostate and surrounding organs-at-risk are less deformed. The aim of this study is to quantify the potential dosimetry changes between the initial plan (prostate deformed) and the more realistic dosimetry when the prostate is less deformed without the cover. The authors prospectively collected the ultrasound images of the prostate immediately preceding and just after inflation of the rectal probe cover from thirty-four consecutive patients undergoing real-time planning of I-125 permanent seed implant. Manual segmentations of the deformed and undeformed images from each case were used as the input for model training to generate the initial transformation of a testing patient. During registration, the pixel-to-pixel transformation was further optimized to maximize the mutual information between the transferred deformed image and the undeformed images. The accuracy of image registration was evaluated by comparing the displacement of the urethra and calcification landmarks and by determining the Dice index between the registered and manual prostate contours. After registration, using the optimized transformation, the implanted seeds were mapped from the deformed prostate onto the undeformed prostate. The dose distribution of the undeformed anatomy, calculated using the VariSeed treatment planning system, was then analyzed and compared with that of the deformed prostate. The accuracy of image registration was 1.5 ± 1.0 mm when evaluated by the displacement of calcification landmarks, 1.9 ± 1.1 mm when characterized by the displacement of the centroid of the urethra, and 0.86 ± 0.05 from the determination of the Dice index of prostate contours. The magnitude of dosimetric changes was associated with the degree of prostate deformation. The prostate coverage V100% dropped from 96.6 ± 1.7% on prostate-deformed plans to 92.6 ± 3.8% (p < 0.01) on undeformed plans, and the rectum V100% decreased from 0.48 ± 0.39 to 0.06 ± 0.14 cm<sup>3</sup> (p < 0.01).

Neoadjuvant Therapy for Rectal Cancer Affects Lymph Node Yield and Status Without Clear Implications on Outcome: The Case for Eliminating a Metric and Using Preoperative Staging to Guide Therapy.,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,2016-12-01,"Nodal status has long been considered pivotal to oncologic care, staging, and management. This has resulted in the establishment of rudimentary metrics regarding adequate lymph node yield in colon and rectal cancers for accurate cancer staging. In the era of neoadjuvant treatment, the implications of lymph node yield and status on patient outcomes remains unclear. This study included 1,680 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer from the NCCN prospective oncology database stratified into 3 groups based on preoperative therapy received: no neoadjuvant therapy, neoadjuvant chemoradiation, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Clinicopathologic characteristics and survival were compared between the groups, with univariate and multivariate analyses undertaken. The clinicopathologic characteristics demonstrated statistically significant differences and heterogeneity among the 3 groups. The neoadjuvant chemoradiation group demonstrated the statistically lowest median lymph node yield (n=15) compared with 17 and 18 for no-neoadjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy, respectively (P<.0001). Neoadjuvant treatment did impact survival, with chemoradiation demonstrating increased median overall survival of 42.7 compared with 37.3 and 26.6 months for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and no-neoadjuvant therapy, respectively (P<.0001). Patients with a yield of fewer than 12 lymph nodes had improved median overall survival of 43.3 months compared with 36.6 months in patients with 12 or more lymph nodes (P=.009). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that neither node yield nor status were predictors for overall survival. This analysis reiterates that nodal yield in rectal cancer is multifactorial, with neoadjuvant therapy being a significant factor. Node yield and status were not significant predictors of overall survival. A nodal metric may not be clinically relevant in the era of neoadjuvant therapy, and guidelines for perioperative therapy may need reconsideration.",Comparative Study,1146.0,9.0,"Nodal status has long been considered pivotal to oncologic care staging and management This has resulted in the establishment of rudimentary metrics regarding adequate lymph node yield in and cancers for accurate cancer staging In the era of neoadjuvant treatment the implications of lymph node yield and status on patient outcomes remains unclear This study included 1,680 patients with locally advanced cancer from the NCCN prospective oncology database stratified into 3 groups based on preoperative therapy received no neoadjuvant therapy neoadjuvant chemoradiation and neoadjuvant chemotherapy Clinicopathologic characteristics and survival were compared between the groups with univariate and multivariate analyses undertaken The clinicopathologic characteristics demonstrated statistically significant differences and heterogeneity among the 3 groups The neoadjuvant chemoradiation group demonstrated the statistically lowest median lymph node yield n=15 compared with 17 and 18 for no-neoadjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy respectively P .0001 Neoadjuvant treatment did impact survival with chemoradiation demonstrating increased median overall survival of 42.7 compared with 37.3 and 26.6 months for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and no-neoadjuvant therapy respectively P .0001 Patients with a yield of fewer than 12 lymph nodes had improved median overall survival of 43.3 months compared with 36.6 months in patients with 12 or more lymph nodes P=.009 Multivariate analysis demonstrated that neither node yield nor status were predictors for overall survival This analysis reiterates that nodal yield in cancer is multifactorial with neoadjuvant therapy being a significant factor Node yield and status were not significant predictors of overall survival A nodal metric may not be clinically relevant in the era of neoadjuvant therapy and guidelines for perioperative therapy may need reconsideration",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[779, 156, 71, 319, 85, 515, 3754, 6, 1998, 165, 632, 2, 284, 26, 71, 627, 4, 3, 5346, 1, 48046, 3589, 666, 1658, 263, 289, 2309, 4, 2, 163, 9, 1481, 12, 632, 4, 3, 1713, 1, 536, 24, 3, 1268, 1, 263, 289, 2309, 2, 156, 23, 69, 123, 469, 1200, 26, 45, 159, 14, 9297, 7, 5, 795, 131, 12, 29, 3, 1944, 482, 413, 609, 1173, 237, 27, 271, 90, 23, 498, 36, 103, 77, 536, 36, 536, 975, 2, 536, 56, 1399, 374, 2, 25, 11, 72, 59, 3, 271, 5, 880, 2, 331, 318, 2789, 3, 1399, 374, 264, 712, 93, 362, 2, 1144, 107, 3, 27, 271, 3, 536, 975, 87, 264, 3, 712, 2101, 52, 263, 289, 2309, 78, 167, 72, 5, 269, 2, 203, 9, 77, 536, 2, 536, 56, 106, 19, 488, 536, 24, 205, 345, 25, 5, 975, 2219, 101, 52, 63, 25, 1, 595, 67, 72, 5, 567, 27, 2, 432, 49, 53, 9, 536, 56, 2, 77, 536, 36, 106, 19, 488, 7, 5, 8, 2309, 1, 1497, 76, 133, 263, 502, 42, 231, 52, 63, 25, 1, 601, 27, 53, 72, 5, 511, 49, 53, 4, 7, 5, 133, 15, 80, 263, 502, 19, 2376, 331, 65, 264, 17, 2174, 289, 2309, 2110, 156, 11, 674, 9, 63, 25, 26, 65, 40245, 17, 779, 2309, 4, 12, 16, 7059, 5, 536, 36, 486, 8, 93, 161, 289, 2309, 2, 156, 11, 44, 93, 674, 1, 63, 25, 8, 779, 6515, 68, 44, 40, 505, 867, 4, 3, 1713, 1, 536, 36, 2, 677, 9, 1547, 36, 68, 594, 23110]",1909.0,27956537,552
Neoadjuvant long-course chemoradiation remains strongly favored over short-course radiotherapy by radiation oncologists in the United States.,Cancer,Cancer,2016-12-16,"Short-course radiotherapy (SC-RT) and long-course chemoradiotherapy (LC-CRT) are accepted neoadjuvant treatments of rectal cancer. In the current study, the authors surveyed US radiation oncologists to assess practice patterns and attitudes regarding SC-RT and LC-CRT for patients with rectal cancer. The authors distributed a survey to 1701 radiation oncologists regarding treatment of neoadjuvant rectal cancer. Respondents were asked questions regarding the number of patients with rectal cancer treated, preference for SC-RT versus LC-CRT, and factors influencing regimen choice. Of 1659 contactable physicians, 182 responses (11%) were received. Approximately 83% treated at least 5 patients with rectal cancer annually. The majority of responding radiation oncologists (96%) preferred neoadjuvant LC-CRT for the treatment of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer and 44% never used SC-RT. Among radiation oncologists using SC-RT, respondents indicated they would not recommend this regimen for patients with low (74%) or bulky tumors (70%) and/or concern for a positive circumferential surgical resection margin (69%). The most frequent reasons for not offering SC-RT were insufficient downstaging for sphincter preservation (53%) and a desire for longer follow-up (45%). Many radiation oncologists indicated they would prescribe SC-RT for patients not receiving chemotherapy (62%) or patients with a geographic barrier to receiving LC-CRT (82%). Patient comorbidities appeared to influence regimen preferences for 79% of respondents. Approximately 20% of respondents indicated that altered oncology care reimbursement using capitated payment by diagnosis would impact their consideration of SC-RT. US radiation oncologists rarely use neoadjuvant SC-RT despite 3 randomized controlled trials demonstrating no significant differences in outcome compared with LC-CRT. Further research is necessary to determine whether longer follow-up coupled with the benefits of lower cost, increased patient convenience, and lower acute toxicity will increase the adoption of SC-RT by radiation oncologists in the United States.

Oncological Outcomes After Robotic Proctectomy for Rectal Cancer: Analysis of a Prospective Database.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2018-03-01,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the oncological outcomes of robotic total mesorectal excision (TME) at an NCI designated cancer center. The effectiveness of laparoscopic TME could not be established, but the robotic-assisted approach may hold some promise, with improved visualization and ergonomics for pelvic dissection. Oncological outcome data is presently lacking. Patients who underwent total mesorectal excision or tumor-specific mesorectal excision for rectal cancer between April 2009 and April 2016 via a robotic approach were identified from a prospective single-institution database. The circumferential resection margin (CRM), distal resection margin, and TME completeness rates were determined. Kaplan-Meier analysis of disease-free survival and overall survival was performed for all patients treated with curative intent. A total of 276 patients underwent robotic proctectomy during the study period. Robotic surgery was performed initially by 1 surgeon with 3 additional surgeons progressively transitioning from open to robotic during the study period with annual increase in the total number of cases performed robotically. Seven patients had involved circumferential resection margins (2.5%), and there were no positive distal or proximal resection margins. One hundred eighty-six patients had TME quality assessed, and only 1 patient (0.5%) had an incomplete TME.

"Comparison of Digital Rectal Examination and Serum Prostate Specific Antigen in the Early Detection of Prostate Cancer: Results of a Multicenter Clinical Trial of 6,630 Men.",The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2016-12-22,"To compare the efficacy of digital rectal examination and serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the early detection of prostate cancer, we conducted a prospective clinical trial at 6 university centers of 6,630 male volunteers 50 years old or older who underwent PSA determination (Hybritech Tandom-E or Tandem-R assays) and digital rectal examination. Quadrant biopsies were performed if the PSA level was greater than 4 μg./l. or digital rectal examination was suspicious, even if transrectal ultrasonography revealed no areas suspicious for cancer. The results showed that 15% of the men had a PSA level of greater than 4 μg./l., 15% had a suspicious digital rectal examination and 26% had suspicious findings on either or both tests. Of 1,167 biopsies performed cancer was detected in 264. PSA detected significantly more tumors (82%, 216 of 264 cancers) than digital rectal examination (55%, 146 of 264, p = 0.001). The cancer detection rate was 3.2% for digital rectal examination, 4.6% for PSA and 5.8% for the 2 methods combined. Positive predictive value was 32% for PSA and 21% for digital rectal examination. Of 160 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and pathological staging 114 (71%) had organ confined cancer: PSA detected 85 (75%) and digital rectal examination detected 64 (56%, p = 0.003). Use of the 2 methods in combination increased detection of organ confined disease by 78% (50 of 64 cases) over digital rectal examination alone. If the performance of a biopsy would have required suspicious transrectal ultrasonography findings, nearly 40% of the tumors would have been missed. We conclude that the use of PSA in conjunction with digital rectal examination enhances early prostate cancer detection. Prostatic biopsy should be considered if either the PSA level is greater than 4 μg./l. or digital rectal examination is suspicious for cancer, even in the absence of abnormal transrectal ultrasonography findings.",Clinical Trial,1125.0,17.0,"To compare the efficacy of digital examination and serum specific antigen PSA in the early detection of cancer we conducted a prospective clinical trial at 6 university centers of 6,630 male volunteers 50 years old or older who underwent PSA determination Hybritech Tandom-E or Tandem-R assays and digital examination Quadrant biopsies were performed if the PSA level was greater than 4 μg./l or digital examination was suspicious even if transrectal ultrasonography revealed no areas suspicious for cancer The results showed that 15 of the men had a PSA level of greater than 4 μg./l. 15 had a suspicious digital examination and 26 had suspicious findings on either or both tests Of 1,167 biopsies performed cancer was detected in 264 PSA detected significantly more tumors 82 216 of 264 cancers than digital examination 55 146 of 264 p 0.001 The cancer detection rate was 3.2 for digital examination 4.6 for PSA and 5.8 for the 2 methods combined Positive predictive value was 32 for PSA and 21 for digital examination Of 160 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and pathological staging 114 71 had organ confined cancer PSA detected 85 75 and digital examination detected 64 56 p 0.003 Use of the 2 methods in combination increased detection of organ confined disease by 78 50 of 64 cases over digital examination alone If the performance of a biopsy would have required suspicious transrectal ultrasonography findings nearly 40 of the tumors would have been missed We conclude that the use of PSA in conjunction with digital examination enhances early cancer detection Prostatic biopsy should be considered if either the PSA level is greater than 4 μg./l or digital examination is suspicious for cancer even in the absence of abnormal transrectal ultrasonography findings",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[6, 932, 3, 209, 1, 3271, 1385, 2, 524, 112, 448, 534, 4, 3, 191, 638, 1, 12, 21, 426, 8, 482, 38, 160, 28, 49, 1652, 1168, 1, 49, 10939, 1045, 5495, 212, 60, 1095, 15, 434, 54, 208, 534, 3104, 27830, 69553, 563, 15, 2905, 668, 1013, 2, 3271, 1385, 8832, 1154, 11, 173, 492, 3, 534, 301, 10, 378, 76, 39, 3802, 805, 15, 3271, 1385, 10, 3230, 871, 492, 9409, 4244, 553, 77, 1361, 3230, 9, 12, 3, 99, 224, 17, 167, 1, 3, 325, 42, 8, 534, 301, 1, 378, 76, 39, 3802, 805, 167, 42, 8, 3230, 3271, 1385, 2, 432, 42, 3230, 272, 23, 361, 15, 110, 895, 1, 14, 5431, 1154, 173, 12, 10, 530, 4, 6528, 534, 530, 97, 80, 57, 878, 6287, 1, 6528, 163, 76, 3271, 1385, 614, 4909, 1, 6528, 19, 13, 144, 3, 12, 638, 116, 10, 27, 18, 9, 3271, 1385, 39, 49, 9, 534, 2, 33, 66, 9, 3, 18, 636, 397, 109, 464, 549, 10, 531, 9, 534, 2, 239, 9, 3271, 1385, 1, 3457, 7, 54, 208, 711, 1202, 2, 1301, 632, 3803, 792, 42, 1259, 2902, 12, 534, 530, 772, 481, 2, 3271, 1385, 530, 660, 664, 19, 13, 1421, 119, 1, 3, 18, 636, 4, 150, 101, 638, 1, 1259, 2902, 34, 20, 833, 212, 1, 660, 140, 252, 3271, 1385, 279, 492, 3, 528, 1, 8, 411, 688, 47, 616, 3230, 9409, 4244, 272, 1857, 327, 1, 3, 57, 688, 47, 85, 5149, 21, 2060, 17, 3, 119, 1, 534, 4, 3357, 5, 3271, 1385, 2519, 191, 12, 638, 3329, 411, 257, 40, 515, 492, 361, 3, 534, 301, 16, 378, 76, 39, 3802, 805, 15, 3271, 1385, 16, 3230, 9, 12, 871, 4, 3, 1127, 1, 1668, 9409, 4244, 272]",1783.0,28012755,158

Intraoperative radiation therapy for colon and rectal cancers: a clinical review.,"Radiation oncology (London, England)",Radiat Oncol,2017-01-11,"Although there have been significant advances in the adjuvant therapy of colorectal cancer, results for patients have historically been poor when complete resection is unlikely or not possible. Similarly, locally recurrent colorectal cancer patients often experience significant tumor related morbidity and disease control and long term survival have historically been poor with standard therapies. Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) has been proposed as a possible tool for dose escalation in patients with locally advanced colorectal cancer.For patients with locally advanced primary or recurrent colon cancer, the absence of prospective controlled trials limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions in completely resected patients. In subtotally resected patients, the available evidence is consistent with marked improvements in disease control and survival compared to historical controls. For patients with locally advanced primary or recurrent rectal cancer, a relatively large body of evidence suggests improved disease control and survival, especially in subtotally resected patients, with the addition of IORT to moderate dose external beam radiation (EBRT) and chemotherapy. The most important prognostic factor in nearly all series is the completeness of surgical resection. Many previously irradiated patients may be carefully re-treated with radiation and IORT in addition to chemotherapy resulting in long term survival in more than 25% of patients. Peripheral nerve is dose limiting for IORT and patients receiving 15 Gy or more are at higher risk.IORT is a useful tool when dose escalation beyond EBRT tolerance limits is required for acceptable local control in patients with locally advanced primary or recurrent colorectal cancer.

Association of Dietary Patterns With Risk of Colorectal Cancer Subtypes Classified by Fusobacterium nucleatum in Tumor Tissue.,JAMA oncology,JAMA Oncol,2017-07-01,"Fusobacterium nucleatum appears to play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis through suppression of the hosts' immune response to tumor. Evidence also suggests that diet influences intestinal F nucleatum. However, the role of F nucleatum in mediating the relationship between diet and the risk of colorectal cancer is unknown. To test the hypothesis that the associations of prudent diets (rich in whole grains and dietary fiber) and Western diets (rich in red and processed meat, refined grains, and desserts) with colorectal cancer risk may differ according to the presence of F nucleatum in tumor tissue. A prospective cohort study was conducted using data from the Nurses' Health Study (June 1, 1980, to June 1, 2012) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (June 1, 1986, to June 1, 2012) on a total of 121 700 US female nurses and 51 529 US male health professionals aged 30 to 55 years and 40 to 75 years, respectively (both predominantly white individuals), at enrollment. Data analysis was performed from March 15, 2015, to August 10, 2016. Prudent and Western diets. Incidence of colorectal carcinoma subclassified by F nucleatum status in tumor tissue, determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Of the 173 229 individuals considered for the study, 137 217 were included in the analysis, 47 449 were male (34.6%), and mean (SD) baseline age for men was 54.0 (9.8) years and for women, 46.3 (7.2) years. A total of 1019 incident colon and rectal cancer cases with available F nucleatum data were documented over 26 to 32 years of follow-up, encompassing 3 643 562 person-years. The association of prudent diet with colorectal cancer significantly differed by tissue F nucleatum status (P = .01 for heterogeneity); prudent diet score was associated with a lower risk of F nucleatum-positive cancers (P = .003 for trend; multivariable hazard ratio of 0.43; 95% CI, 0.25-0.72, for the highest vs the lowest prudent score quartile) but not with F nucleatum-negative cancers (P = .47 for trend, the corresponding multivariable hazard ratio of 0.95; 95% CI, 0.77-1.17). There was no significant heterogeneity between the subgroups in relation to Western dietary pattern scores.

A literature review was also performed of the dominant Haemophilus subtype and the clinical features associated with the infection and concomitant cancer. Of the 17 cases found in the literature, had hematological malignancies and 1 case each had thymoma, schwannoma, teratoma, and pancreatic, Merkel cell, pharyngeal, laryngeal, and rectal carcinomas. Two cases occurred with AIDS and Kaposi sarcoma. Pneumonia with bacteremia was seen in 8 cases, whereas pleuritis, neck cellulitis, septic arthritis, meningitis, and mediastinitis were diagnosed in the others. No focus of infection was identified in 2 cases. Nontypable H influenzae (NTHi) occurred in 4 cases, and Hib was isolated in 2 cases; serotyping was not reported in the others. Leukocytosis occurred in 7 cases and lymphopenia in 3; no cases presented with neutropenia. Four isolates were positive for beta-lactamase. Susceptibility data were unavailable in 5 case patients.

Three Different Approaches to the Inferior Mesenteric Artery during Robotic D3 Lymphadenectomy for Rectal Cancer.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2017-02-17,"In rectal cancer surgery, proximal ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) with radical lymphadenectomy is the accepted standard of care.1 Our purpose is to describe three different standardized technical approaches for the management of the IMA during D3 lymphadenectomy.2 METHODS: Operative videos of three robotic D3 lymphadenectomy procedures for rectal cancer were reviewed and annotated with schematic anatomical descriptions for clarification. There are three methods for the management of the IMA during D3 lymphadenectomy for rectal cancer. Standard high ligation is technically the simplest to perform and provides excellent mesenteric length but relies solely on marginal vessel blood supply from the middle colic artery.3 Low ligation with ascending left colic artery preservation is more complex technically but affords excellent vascular supply due to preservation of IMA blood flow, while potentially limiting mesenteric length.4 The central vascular sparing technique is the most complex to perform but allows excellent mesenteric length due to the presence of two separate points of mesenteric division, while also potentially improving blood supply due to decreased vascular resistance and improved collateralization.

Dietary Patterns and Risk of Colorectal Cancer: Analysis by Tumor Location and Molecular Subtypes.,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,2017-02-27,"Western and prudent dietary patterns have been associated with higher and lower risks of colorectal cancer (CRC), respectively. However, little is known about the associations between dietary patterns and specific anatomic subsites or molecular subtypes of CRC. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to examine the associations between Western and prudent dietary patterns and CRC risk in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and Nurses' Health Study. After up to 32 years of follow-up of 137,217 men and women, we documented 3260 cases of CRC. Among individuals from whom subsite data were available, we observed 1264 proximal colon, 866 distal colon, and 670 rectal tumors. Western diet was associated with an increased incidence of CRC (P<sub>trend</sub> < .0001), with a relative risk (RR) of 1.31 (95% CI, 1.15-1.48, comparing the highest to lowest quartile). The association of Western diet with CRC was evident for tumors of the distal colon (RR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.22-1.96; P<sub>trend</sub> = .0004) and rectum (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.03-1.77; P<sub>trend</sub> = .01) but not proximal colon (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.91-1.35; P<sub>trend</sub> = .51) when we comparing extreme quartiles. In contrast, for the prudent pattern, we observed a RR of 0.86 for overall CRC (95% CI, 0.77-0.95; P<sub>trend</sub> = .01), with similar trends at anatomic subsites. However, the trend appeared stronger among men than women. Among 1285 cases (39%) with tissue available for molecular profiling, Western diet appeared to be more strongly associated with some CRC molecular subtypes (no mutations in KRAS [KRAS wildtype] or BRAF [BRAF wildtype], no or a low CpG island methylator phenotype, and microsatellite stability), although formal tests for heterogeneity did not produce statistically significant results. Western dietary patterns are associated with an increased risk of CRC, particularly distal colon and rectal tumors. Western dietary patterns also appear more strongly associated with tumors that are KRAS wildtype, BRAF wildtype, have no or a low CpG island methylator phenotype, and microsatellite stability. In contrast, prudent dietary patterns are associated with a lower risk of CRC that does not vary according to anatomic subsite or molecular subtype.",Comparative Study,1058.0,31.0,"Western and prudent dietary patterns have been associated with higher and lower risks of cancer CRC respectively However little is known about the associations between dietary patterns and specific anatomic subsites or molecular subtypes of CRC We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to examine the associations between Western and prudent dietary patterns and CRC risk in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and Nurses Health Study After up to 32 years of follow-up of 137,217 men and women we documented 3260 cases of CRC Among individuals from whom subsite data were available we observed 1264 proximal 866 distal and 670 tumors Western diet was associated with an increased incidence of CRC P sub trend /sub .0001 with a relative risk RR of 1.31 95 CI 1.15-1.48 comparing the highest to lowest quartile The association of Western diet with CRC was evident for tumors of the distal RR 1.55 95 CI 1.22-1.96 P sub trend /sub .0004 and rectum RR 1.35 95 CI 1.03-1.77 P sub trend /sub .01 but not proximal RR 1.11 95 CI 0.91-1.35 P sub trend /sub .51 when we comparing extreme quartiles In contrast for the prudent pattern we observed a RR of 0.86 for overall CRC 95 CI 0.77-0.95 P sub trend /sub .01 with similar trends at anatomic subsites However the trend appeared stronger among men than women Among 1285 cases 39 with tissue available for molecular profiling Western diet appeared to be more strongly associated with some CRC molecular subtypes no mutations in KRAS KRAS wildtype or BRAF BRAF wildtype no or a low CpG island methylator phenotype and microsatellite stability although formal tests for heterogeneity did not produce statistically significant results Western dietary patterns are associated with an increased risk of CRC particularly distal and tumors Western dietary patterns also appear more strongly associated with tumors that are KRAS wildtype BRAF wildtype have no or a low CpG island methylator phenotype and microsatellite stability In contrast prudent dietary patterns are associated with a lower risk of CRC that does not vary according to anatomic subsite or molecular subtype",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[1521, 2, 10263, 2013, 764, 47, 85, 41, 5, 142, 2, 280, 1098, 1, 12, 590, 106, 137, 1215, 16, 440, 545, 3, 685, 59, 2013, 764, 2, 112, 2745, 11239, 15, 219, 814, 1, 590, 21, 95, 658, 418, 831, 1017, 274, 6, 1004, 3, 685, 59, 1521, 2, 10263, 2013, 764, 2, 590, 43, 4, 3, 341, 3409, 166, 126, 45, 2, 2707, 341, 45, 50, 126, 6, 531, 60, 1, 166, 126, 1, 4352, 6499, 325, 2, 117, 21, 1405, 44365, 140, 1, 590, 107, 869, 29, 953, 9483, 74, 11, 390, 21, 164, 44507, 2805, 8883, 2107, 2, 10335, 57, 1521, 2453, 10, 41, 5, 35, 101, 287, 1, 590, 19, 551, 853, 551, 488, 5, 8, 580, 43, 861, 1, 14, 456, 48, 58, 14, 167, 14, 576, 1430, 3, 1076, 6, 2101, 3708, 3, 248, 1, 1521, 2453, 5, 590, 10, 2853, 9, 57, 1, 3, 2107, 861, 14, 614, 48, 58, 14, 350, 14, 921, 19, 551, 853, 551, 5295, 2, 3660, 861, 14, 465, 48, 58, 14, 680, 14, 849, 19, 551, 853, 551, 355, 84, 44, 2805, 861, 14, 175, 48, 58, 13, 970, 14, 465, 19, 551, 853, 551, 725, 198, 21, 1430, 5611, 6028, 4, 748, 9, 3, 10263, 1177, 21, 164, 8, 861, 1, 13, 868, 9, 63, 590, 48, 58, 13, 849, 13, 48, 19, 551, 853, 551, 355, 5, 288, 1963, 28, 2745, 11239, 137, 3, 853, 2121, 3355, 107, 325, 76, 117, 107, 27987, 140, 587, 5, 246, 390, 9, 219, 1080, 1521, 2453, 2121, 6, 40, 80, 1327, 41, 5, 476, 590, 219, 814, 77, 138, 4, 723, 723, 10063, 15, 566, 566, 10063, 77, 15, 8, 154, 2075, 3454, 5440, 1005, 2, 2226, 2769, 242, 5057, 895, 9, 1144, 205, 44, 2410, 712, 93, 99, 1521, 2013, 764, 32, 41, 5, 35, 101, 43, 1, 590, 823, 2107, 2, 57, 1521, 2013, 764, 120, 1322, 80, 1327, 41, 5, 57, 17, 32, 723, 10063, 566, 10063, 47, 77, 15, 8, 154, 2075, 3454, 5440, 1005, 2, 2226, 2769, 4, 748, 10263, 2013, 764, 32, 41, 5, 8, 280, 43, 1, 590, 17, 1097, 44, 2825, 768, 6, 2745, 9483, 15, 219, 875]",2126.0,28249812,81
A Phase II Study of Ganetespib as Second-line or Third-line Therapy for Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer.,American journal of clinical oncology,Am. J. Clin. Oncol.,2018-08-01,"Heat shock protein 90 regulates multiple signaling proteins involved in key pathways of pancreatic cancer pathogenesis. Ganetespib binds to heat shock protein 90 and interferes with its binding to client proteins thus leading to inactivation and degradation of the signaling proteins that promote cancer progression. This phase II study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of ganetespib in patients with refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer (rMPC). Patients with rMPC received 175 mg/m ganetespib intravenously once weekly for 3 weeks in 4-week cycles. Primary endpoint was disease control rate at 8 weeks, with a goal of 70%. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. Simon's 2-stage design was used to assess futility and efficacy. Ganetespib was considered inactive if ≤8 patients among the first 15 treated had disease control after 8 weeks of treatment. Fourteen patients were treated on study. Grade 3 treatment-related toxicities were diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and hyponatremia. Disease control rate at 8 weeks was 28.6%, and median progression-free survival and overall survival were 1.58 months and 4.57 months, respectively. Early stopping rules for lack of clinical efficacy led to study closure. Single-agent ganetespib was tolerable with only modest disease control in rMPC. This disease is resistant to chemotherapy, and given the emerging data in lung and rectal cancers, as well as in pancreatic cancer cell lines, suggesting improved activity of ganetespib in combination with cytotoxic agents, studies combining this agent with chemotherapy in rMPC are more likely to yield success.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",538.0,3.0,Heat shock protein 90 regulates multiple signaling proteins involved in key pathways of cancer pathogenesis Ganetespib binds to heat shock protein 90 and interferes with its binding to client proteins thus leading to inactivation and degradation of the signaling proteins that promote cancer progression This phase II study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of ganetespib in patients with refractory metastatic cancer rMPC Patients with rMPC received 175 mg/m ganetespib intravenously once weekly for 3 weeks in 4-week cycles Primary endpoint was disease control rate at 8 weeks with a goal of 70 Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival overall survival and safety Simon 's 2-stage design was used to assess futility and efficacy Ganetespib was considered inactive if ≤8 patients among the first 15 treated had disease control after 8 weeks of treatment Fourteen patients were treated on study Grade 3 treatment-related toxicities were diarrhea abdominal pain fatigue nausea vomiting and hyponatremia Disease control rate at 8 weeks was 28.6 and median progression-free survival and overall survival were 1.58 months and 4.57 months respectively Early stopping rules for lack of clinical efficacy led to study closure Single-agent ganetespib was tolerable with only modest disease control in rMPC This disease is resistant to chemotherapy and given the emerging data in and cancers as well as in cancer cell lines suggesting improved activity of ganetespib in combination with cytotoxic agents studies combining this agent with chemotherapy in rMPC are more likely to yield success,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[3545, 3971, 178, 424, 2468, 232, 314, 652, 646, 4, 825, 460, 1, 12, 1384, 7341, 3333, 6, 3545, 3971, 178, 424, 2, 12078, 5, 211, 791, 6, 7304, 652, 631, 1049, 6, 2297, 2, 2373, 1, 3, 314, 652, 17, 1617, 12, 91, 26, 124, 215, 45, 10, 1114, 6, 376, 3, 209, 1, 7341, 4, 7, 5, 430, 113, 12, 36387, 7, 5, 36387, 103, 3300, 81, 188, 7341, 1672, 1059, 709, 9, 27, 244, 4, 39, 647, 410, 86, 1138, 10, 34, 182, 116, 28, 66, 244, 5, 8, 1326, 1, 431, 568, 1387, 11, 91, 115, 25, 63, 25, 2, 367, 7385, 292, 18, 82, 771, 10, 95, 6, 423, 7566, 2, 209, 7341, 10, 515, 5002, 492, 18610, 7, 107, 3, 157, 167, 73, 42, 34, 182, 50, 66, 244, 1, 24, 3225, 7, 11, 73, 23, 45, 88, 27, 24, 139, 385, 11, 1172, 1467, 559, 613, 1218, 1966, 2, 6672, 34, 182, 116, 28, 66, 244, 10, 339, 49, 2, 52, 91, 115, 25, 2, 63, 25, 11, 14, 717, 53, 2, 39, 696, 53, 106, 191, 6811, 8679, 9, 926, 1, 38, 209, 836, 6, 45, 4830, 226, 420, 7341, 10, 2668, 5, 158, 1721, 34, 182, 4, 36387, 26, 34, 16, 436, 6, 56, 2, 447, 3, 1478, 74, 4, 2, 163, 22, 149, 22, 4, 12, 31, 285, 802, 231, 128, 1, 7341, 4, 150, 5, 759, 183, 94, 1525, 26, 420, 5, 56, 4, 36387, 32, 80, 322, 6, 2309, 1825]",1596.0,28301350,440
Nonoperative Management or 'Watch and Wait' for Rectal Cancer with Complete Clinical Response After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy: A Critical Appraisal.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2017-03-21,"There is increasing interest in nonoperative management (NOM) for rectal cancer with complete clinical response (cCR) after neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT). The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the available data on NOM, with the intention of formulating standardized protocols on which to base future investigations. A systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines was conducted. A highly sensitive literature search identified all relevant studies published between January 2004 and December 2016. Data extraction and quality assessment was performed independently by two authors, and resolved by consensus with a third reviewer. In total, 15 studies, including 920 patients, met the inclusion criteria; 575 (62.5%) of these patients underwent NOM after cCR, with the remaining patients forming a surgical control group. The weighted mean follow-up was 39.4 (12.7) months in the NOM group and 39.8 (5.1) months in the surgery group. The pooled regrowth rate in the NOM group was 21.3% at a mean of 15.6 (7.0) months. Surgical salvage was possible and was undertaken in 93.2% of these patients. Overall survival in the NOM group was 91.7%, while disease-free survival was 82.7%.

Impact of neoadjuvant chemoradiation on perioperative outcomes in patients with rectal cancer.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2017-03-23,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer is associated with lower local recurrence rates. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of neoadjuvant therapy on perioperative complications in patients with rectal cancer. Using the ACS-NSQIP database (2005-2012), a propensity score was used to match 3592 patients with rectal cancer receiving neoadjuvant therapy to 3592 patients undergoing surgery alone. The association between neoadjuvant chemoradiation and perioperative outcomes was evaluated. Among all patients, overall morbidity was significantly higher in the neoadjuvant therapy group (n = 1170, 29.9%) compared to the surgery alone (n = 2350, 26.4%; P < 0.0001), but 30-day mortality was lower in the neoadjuvant group (n = 27, 0.7%) compared to the surgery alone group (n = 112, 1.3%; P = 0.0043). However, in propensity-matched patients, there was no difference in overall morbidity (OR 0.912, 95% CI 0.825-1.008) or 30-day mortality (OR 0.639, 95% CI 0.38-1.05).

Abiraterone Acetate for Metastatic Prostate Cancer in Patients With Suboptimal Biochemical Response to Hormone Induction.,JAMA oncology,JAMA Oncol,2017-11-09,"Men with metastatic prostate cancer who have a poor response to initial androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), as reflected by a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level higher than 4.0 ng/mL after 7 months of ADT, have a poor prognosis, based on historical controls. To determine the efficacy of abiraterone acetate with prednisone in these high-risk patients with a suboptimal response to hormonal induction. A phase 2 single-arm study was conducted through the National Clinical Trials Network-Southwest Oncology Group. Eligible patients had metastatic prostate cancer and a PSA level higher than 4.0 ng/mL between 6 and 12 months after starting ADT. The PSA level could be rising or falling at the time of enrollment, but had to be higher than 4.0 ng/mL. No previous chemotherapy or secondary hormonal therapies were allowed, except in patients receiving a standard, first-generation antiandrogen agent with a falling PSA level at the time of enrollment; this therapy was continued in this cohort. Abiraterone acetate, 1000 mg, once daily with prednisone, 5 mg, twice daily was administered to all participants. A total of 41 men were enrolled between the trial's activation on August 9, 2011, and closure on August 1, 2013. Data analysis was conducted from March 21 to November 29, 2016. Abiraterone acetate, 1000 mg, once daily by mouth with prednisone, 5 mg, by mouth twice daily. The primary end point was a PSA level of 0.2 ng/mL or lower within 12 months of starting abiraterone acetate plus prednisone. A partial response (PR) was a secondary end point, defined as a PSA level reduction to lower than 4.0 ng/mL but higher than 0.2 ng/mL. Of the 41 men enrolled, 1 did not receive any protocol treatment and was excluded from analysis. The median (range) age of the 40 participants was 66 (39-85) years. Five (13%) patients achieved a PSA level of 0.2 ng/mL or lower (95% CI, 4%-27%). Thirteen (33%) additional patients achieved a partial response, with a reduction in the PSA level to lower than 4.0 ng/mL but higher than 0.2 ng/mL. Sixteen (40%) patients had no PSA response and 6 (15%) were not assessable and assumed to be nonresponders. The median progression-free survival was 17.5 months (95% CI, 8.6-25.0 months) and the median overall survival was 25.8 months (95% CI, 15.7-25.8 months). There was 1 incident each of grade 4 adverse events of alanine aminotransferase level elevation and rectal hemorrhage. Eleven patients reported grade 3 adverse events. This study did not reach its prescribed level of 6 PSA responses of 0.2 ng/mL or lower, although 5 responses were observed. The overall survival and progression-free survival rates observed in this trial are encouraging compared with historical controls. The therapy was generally well tolerated, without any clear signal of any unexpected adverse effects.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",803.0,3.0,Men with metastatic cancer who have a poor response to

Aspirin Use and Colorectal Cancer Survival According to Tumor CD274 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Ligand 1) Expression Status.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2017-04-13,"Purpose Blockade of the programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1, PD-1) immune checkpoint pathway can improve clinical outcomes in various malignancies. Evidence suggests that aspirin (a widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) not only prolongs colorectal cancer survival, but can also activate T cell-mediated antitumor immunity and synergize with immunotherapy through inhibition of prostaglandin E2 production. We hypothesized that the survival benefit associated with aspirin might be stronger in colorectal carcinoma with a lower CD274 (PDCD1 ligand 1, PD-L1) expression level that resulted in lower signaling of the immune checkpoint pathway. Patients and Methods Using data from 617 patients with rectal and colon cancer in the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, we examined the association of postdiagnosis aspirin use with patient survival in strata of tumor CD274 expression status measured by immunohistochemistry. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models to control for potential confounders, including disease stage, microsatellite instability status, CpG island methylator phenotype, long interspersed nucleotide element-1 methylation, cyclooxygenase-2 (PTGS2), and CDX2 expression, and KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations. Results The association of postdiagnosis aspirin use with colorectal cancer-specific survival differed by CD274 expression status ( P<sub>interaction</sub> < .001); compared with aspirin nonusers; multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for regular aspirin users were 0.16 (95% CI, 0.06 to 0.41) in patients with low CD274 and 1.01 (95% CI, 0.61 to 1.67) in patients with high CD274.

Adjuvant Chemotherapy Is Associated With Improved Overall Survival in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer After Achievement of a Pathologic Complete Response to Chemoradiation.,Clinical colorectal cancer,Clin Colorectal Cancer,2017-03-18,"In locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma, 15% to 20% of patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT) achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR). The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy is controversial in rectal cancer. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of clinical risk factors and adjuvant chemotherapy usage on the outcomes of the pCR patient population. We performed a retrospective study using the National Cancer Data Base from 2006 to 2013. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). The association between OS and patient characteristics (demographics, tumor variables, and treatment) was examined using multivariable Cox regression modelling. A total of 2891 patients were identified who had achieved a pCR. Of these 2891 patients, 2102 received nCRT and 789 received nCRT followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. The median follow-up duration was 43.2 months. The factors significantly associated with OS included age (P < .001), gender (P = .011), Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score (P < .001), grade (P = .029), clinical T stage (P = .030), carcinoembryonic antigen negativity (P = .002), and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy (P < .001). Nodal status was not significantly associated with survival. The 5-year OS rate was 94% in the nCRT plus adjuvant group compared with 84% in the nCRT-alone group. Adjuvant chemotherapy was more likely to be given to younger patients (aged < 60 years), higher grade, lower Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score, elevated carcinoembryonic antigen level, higher clinical T stage, and higher clinical N stage. Our findings showed a significant improvement in OS for patients who received nCRT plus adjuvant chemotherapy compared with those who received nCRT alone. The nCRT plus adjuvant patients were more likely to be younger, have a lower comorbidity score, have clinical ≥ T3 disease, and have clinical node-positive disease. Thus, a selection bias could have been present. Nonetheless, even in the setting of already excellent outcomes, for patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma who achieve a pCR, the additional benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy should be weighed against the potential for toxicity.",Journal Article,1039.0,9.0,In locally advanced adenocarcinoma 15 to 20 of patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation nCRT achieve a pathologic complete response pCR The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy is controversial in cancer Our objective was to evaluate the effect of clinical risk factors and adjuvant chemotherapy usage on the outcomes of the pCR patient population We performed a retrospective study using the National Cancer Data Base from 2006 to 2013 The primary outcome was overall survival OS The association between OS and patient characteristics demographics tumor variables and treatment was examined using multivariable Cox regression modelling A total of 2891 patients were identified who had achieved a pCR Of these 2891 patients 2102 received nCRT and 789 received nCRT followed by adjuvant chemotherapy The median follow-up duration was 43.2 months The factors significantly associated with OS included age P .001 gender P .011 Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score P .001 grade P .029 clinical T stage P .030 carcinoembryonic antigen negativity P .002 and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy P .001 Nodal status was not significantly associated with survival The 5-year OS rate was 94 in the nCRT plus adjuvant group compared with 84 in the nCRT-alone group Adjuvant chemotherapy was more likely to be given to younger patients aged 60 years higher grade lower Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score elevated carcinoembryonic antigen level higher clinical T stage and higher clinical N stage Our findings showed a significant improvement in OS for patients who received nCRT plus adjuvant chemotherapy compared with those who received nCRT alone The nCRT plus adjuvant patients were more likely to be younger have a lower comorbidity score have clinical ≥ T3 disease and have clinical node-positive disease Thus a selection bias could have been present Nonetheless even in the setting of already excellent outcomes for patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma who achieve a pCR the additional benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy should be weighed against the potential for toxicity,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[4, 795, 131, 449, 167, 6, 179, 1, 7, 73, 5, 536, 975, 8353, 1359, 8, 510, 236, 51, 604, 3, 247, 1, 249, 56, 16, 2010, 4, 12, 114, 461, 10, 6, 376, 3, 254, 1, 38, 43, 130, 2, 249, 56, 5015, 23, 3, 123, 1, 3, 604, 69, 266, 21, 173, 8, 459, 45, 75, 3, 657, 12, 74, 1782, 29, 1324, 6, 1346, 3, 86, 228, 10, 63, 25, 118, 3, 248, 59, 118, 2, 69, 374, 2221, 30, 682, 2, 24, 10, 409, 75, 658, 418, 320, 10812, 8, 181, 1, 23972, 7, 11, 108, 54, 42, 513, 8, 604, 1, 46, 23972, 7, 37840, 103, 8353, 2, 16464, 103, 8353, 370, 20, 249, 56, 3, 52, 166, 126, 654, 10, 601, 18, 53, 3, 130, 97, 41, 5, 118, 159, 89, 19, 144, 1632, 19, 3651, 4670, 11523, 1879, 368, 19, 144, 88, 19, 4770, 38, 102, 82, 19, 6542, 5139, 448, 6014, 19, 1111, 2, 1699, 1, 249, 56, 19, 144, 779, 156, 10, 44, 97, 41, 5, 25, 3, 33, 111, 118, 116, 10, 960, 4, 3, 8353, 349, 249, 87, 72, 5, 874, 4, 3, 8353, 279, 87, 249, 56, 10, 80, 322, 6, 40, 447, 6, 773, 7, 1032, 335, 60, 142, 88, 280, 4670, 11523, 1879, 368, 804, 5139, 448, 301, 142, 38, 102, 82, 2, 142, 38, 78, 82, 114, 272, 224, 8, 93, 767, 4, 118, 9, 7, 54, 103, 8353, 349, 249, 56, 72, 5, 135, 54, 103, 8353, 279, 3, 8353, 349, 249, 7, 11, 80, 322, 6, 40, 773, 47, 8, 280, 1879, 368, 47, 38, 749, 2065, 34, 2, 47, 38, 289, 109, 34, 631, 8, 881, 2947, 359, 47, 85, 364, 4648, 871, 4, 3, 546, 1, 3298, 1503, 123, 9, 7, 5, 795, 131, 449, 54, 1359, 8, 604, 3, 402, 247, 1, 249, 56, 257, 40, 10271, 480, 3, 174, 9, 155]",2068.0,28420585,33
Can postoperative process of care utilization or complication rates explain the volume-cost relationship for cancer surgery?,Surgery,Surgery,2017-04-21,"Past studies identify an association between provider volume and outcomes, but less is known about the volume-cost relationship for cancer surgery. We analyze the volume-cost relationship for 6 cancer operations and explore whether it is influenced by the occurrence of complications and/or utilization of processes of care. Medicare hospital and inpatient claims for the years 2005 through 2009 were analyzed for 6 cancer resections: colectomy, rectal resection, pulmonary lobectomy, pneumonectomy, esophagectomy, and pancreatic resection. Regressions were first estimated to quantify the association of provider volume with costs, excluding measures of complications and processes of care as explanatory variables. Next, these variables were added to the regressions to test whether they weakened any previously observed volume-cost relationship. Higher hospital volume is associated with lower patient costs for esophagectomy but not for other operations. Higher surgeon volume reduces costs for most procedures, but this result weakens when processes of care are added to the regressions. Processes of care that are frequently implemented in response to adverse events are associated with 14% to 34% higher costs. Utilization of these processes is more prevalent among low-volume versus high-volume surgeons. Processes of care implemented when complications occur explain much of the surgeon volume-cost relationship. Given that surgeon volume is readily observed, better outcomes and lower costs may be achieved by referring patients to high-volume surgeons. Increasing patient access to surgeons with lower rates of complications may be the most effective strategy for avoiding costly processes of care, controlling expenditure growth.",Journal Article,1005.0,5.0,Past studies identify an association between provider volume and outcomes but less is known about the volume-cost relationship for cancer surgery We analyze the volume-cost relationship for 6 cancer operations and explore whether it is influenced by the occurrence of complications and/or utilization of processes of care Medicare hospital and inpatient claims for the years 2005 through 2009 were analyzed for 6 cancer resections colectomy resection pulmonary lobectomy pneumonectomy esophagectomy and resection Regressions were first estimated to quantify the association of provider volume with costs excluding measures of complications and processes of care as explanatory variables Next these variables were added to the regressions to test whether they weakened any previously observed volume-cost relationship Higher hospital volume is associated with lower patient costs for esophagectomy but not for other operations Higher surgeon volume reduces costs for most procedures but this result weakens when processes of care are added to the regressions Processes of care that are frequently implemented in response to adverse events are associated with 14 to 34 higher costs Utilization of these processes is more prevalent among low-volume versus high-volume surgeons Processes of care implemented when complications occur explain much of the surgeon volume-cost relationship Given that surgeon volume is readily observed better outcomes and lower costs may be achieved by referring patients to high-volume surgeons Increasing patient access to surgeons with lower rates of complications may be the most effective strategy for avoiding costly processes of care controlling expenditure growth,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[1219, 94, 255, 35, 248, 59, 3094, 433, 2, 123, 84, 299, 16, 440, 545, 3, 433, 835, 858, 9, 12, 152, 21, 1992, 3, 433, 835, 858, 9, 49, 12, 3867, 2, 1645, 317, 192, 16, 2574, 20, 3, 2291, 1, 521, 2, 15, 1961, 1, 1849, 1, 165, 1378, 702, 2, 2420, 2770, 9, 3, 60, 1242, 298, 1238, 11, 311, 9, 49, 12, 2185, 6419, 170, 1087, 3258, 4853, 3617, 2, 170, 5142, 11, 157, 661, 6, 3091, 3, 248, 1, 3094, 433, 5, 1201, 3207, 1018, 1, 521, 2, 1849, 1, 165, 22, 18277, 682, 1305, 46, 682, 11, 1953, 6, 3, 5142, 6, 412, 317, 491, 25327, 500, 373, 164, 433, 835, 858, 142, 702, 433, 16, 41, 5, 280, 69, 1201, 9, 3617, 84, 44, 9, 127, 3867, 142, 1897, 433, 2389, 1201, 9, 96, 1369, 84, 26, 757, 40040, 198, 1849, 1, 165, 32, 1953, 6, 3, 5142, 1849, 1, 165, 17, 32, 746, 3426, 4, 51, 6, 290, 281, 32, 41, 5, 213, 6, 562, 142, 1201, 1961, 1, 46, 1849, 16, 80, 2485, 107, 154, 433, 185, 64, 433, 1613, 1849, 1, 165, 3426, 198, 521, 1271, 2943, 1802, 1, 3, 1897, 433, 835, 858, 447, 17, 1897, 433, 16, 3860, 164, 380, 123, 2, 280, 1201, 68, 40, 513, 20, 8636, 7, 6, 64, 433, 1613, 602, 69, 1655, 6, 1613, 5, 280, 151, 1, 521, 68, 40, 3, 96, 323, 692, 9, 6048, 6288, 1849, 1, 165, 1893, 8699, 129]",1697.0,28438333,109
ACR Appropriateness Criteria<sup>®</sup> Pretreatment Staging of Colorectal Cancer.,Journal of the American College of Radiology : JACR,J Am Coll Radiol,2017-05-01,"Colorectal cancers are common tumors in the United States and appropriate imaging is essential to direct appropriate care. Staging and treatment differs between tumors arising in the colon versus the rectum. Local staging for colon cancer is less integral to directing therapy given radical resection is often standard. Surgical options for rectal carcinoma are more varied and rely on accurate assessment of the sphincter, circumferential resection margins, and peritoneal reflection. These important anatomic landmarks are best appreciated on high-resolution imaging with transrectal ultrasound or MRI. When metastatic disease is suspected, imaging modalities that provide a global view of the body, such as CT with contrast or PET/CT may be indicated. Rectal cancer often metastasizes to the liver and so MRI of the liver with and without contrast provides accurate staging for liver metastases. This article focuses on local and distant staging and reviews the appropriateness of different imaging for both variants.

Hospital Minimally Invasive Surgery Utilization for Gastrointestinal Cancer.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2018-08-01,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of receiving care at high minimally invasive surgery (MIS)-utilizing hospitals BACKGROUND:: MIS techniques are used across surgical specialties. The extent of MIS utilization for gastrointestinal (GI) cancer resection and impact of receiving care at high utilizing hospitals is unclear. This is a retrospective cohort study of 137,581 surgically resected esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, hepatobiliary, colon, and rectal cancer patients within the National Cancer Data Base (2010-2013). Disease-specific, hospital-level, reliability-adjusted MIS utilization rates were calculated to evaluate perioperative outcomes. Among patients for whom adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) was indicated, the association between days to AC and hospital MIS utilization was examined using generalized estimating equations. Association with risk of death was evaluated using multivariable Cox regression. Disease-specific MIS use increased significantly [42.0%-68.3% increase; trend test, P < 0.001 for all except hepatobiliary (P = 0.007)] over time. Most hospitals [range-30.3% (colon); 92.9% (pancreatic)] were low utilizers (≤30% of cases). Higher MIS utilization is associated with increased lymph nodes examined (P < 0.001, all) and shorter length of stay (P < 0.001, all). Each 10% increase in MIS utilization is associated with fewer days to AC [3.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-5.3) for MIS gastric; 3.3 ([0.7-5.8) for open gastric; 1.1 (0.3-2.0) days for open colon]. An association between MIS utilization and risk of death was observed for colon [Q2-hazard ratio (HR) 0.96 (0.89-1.02); Q3-HR 0.91 (0.86-0.98); Q4-HR 0.87 (0.82-0.93)] and rectal cancer [Q2-HR 0.89 (0.76-1.05); Q3-HR 0.84 (0.82-0.97); Q4-HR 0.86 (0.74-0.98)]. Most hospitals treating GI malignancies are low MIS utilizers.

Body mass index and risk of colorectal carcinoma subtypes classified by tumor differentiation status.,European journal of epidemiology,Eur. J. Epidemiol.,2017-05-16,"Previous studies suggest that abnormal energy balance status may dysregulate intestinal epithelial homeostasis and promote colorectal carcinogenesis, yet little is known about how host energy balance and obesity influence enterocyte differentiation during carcinogenesis. We hypothesized that the association between high body mass index (BMI) and colorectal carcinoma incidence might differ according to tumor histopathologic differentiation status. Using databases of the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, and duplication-method Cox proportional hazards models, we prospectively examined an association between BMI and the incidence of colorectal carcinoma subtypes classified by differentiation features. 120,813 participants were followed for 26 or 32 years and 1528 rectal and colon cancer cases with available tumor pathological data were documented. The association between BMI and colorectal cancer risk significantly differed depending on the presence or absence of poorly-differentiated foci (P<sub>heterogeneity</sub> = 0.006). Higher BMI was associated with a higher risk of colorectal carcinoma without poorly-differentiated foci (≥30.0 vs. 18.5-22.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>: multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.49-2.34; P<sub>trend</sub> < 0.001), but not with risk of carcinoma with poorly-differentiated foci (P<sub>trend</sub> = 0.56). This differential association appeared to be consistent in strata of tumor microsatellite instability or FASN expression status, although the statistical power was limited. The association between BMI and colorectal carcinoma risk did not significantly differ by overall tumor differentiation, mucinous differentiation, or signet ring cell component (P<sub>heterogeneity</sub> > 0.03, with the adjusted α of 0.01). High BMI was associated with risk of colorectal cancer subtype containing no poorly-differentiated focus. Our findings suggest that carcinogenic influence of excess energy balance might be stronger for tumors that retain better intestinal differentiation throughout the tumor areas.",Journal Article,980.0,7.0,"Previous studies suggest that abnormal energy balance status may dysregulate intestinal epithelial homeostasis and promote carcinogenesis yet little is known about how host energy balance and obesity influence enterocyte differentiation during carcinogenesis We hypothesized that the association between high body mass index BMI and carcinoma incidence might differ according to tumor histopathologic differentiation status Using databases of the Nurses Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study and duplication-method Cox proportional hazards models we prospectively examined an association between BMI and the incidence of carcinoma subtypes classified by differentiation features 120,813 participants were followed for 26 or 32 years and 1528 and cancer cases with available tumor pathological data were documented The association between BMI and cancer risk significantly differed depending on the presence or absence of poorly-differentiated foci P sub heterogeneity /sub 0.006 Higher BMI was associated with a higher risk of carcinoma without poorly-differentiated foci ≥30.0 vs. 18.5-22.4 kg/m sup 2 /sup multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio 1.87 95 confidence interval 1.49-2.34 P sub trend /sub 0.001 but not with risk of carcinoma with poorly-differentiated foci P sub trend /sub 0.56 This differential association appeared to be consistent in strata of tumor microsatellite instability or FASN expression status although the statistical power was limited The association between BMI and carcinoma risk did not significantly differ by overall tumor differentiation mucinous differentiation or signet ring cell component P sub heterogeneity /sub 0.03 with the adjusted of 0.01 High BMI was associated with risk of cancer subtype containing no poorly-differentiated focus Our findings suggest that carcinogenic influence of excess energy balance might be stronger for tumors that retain better intestinal differentiation throughout the tumor areas",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[698, 94, 309, 17, 1668, 2803, 3459, 156, 68, 31563, 3077, 701, 4975, 2, 1617, 1719, 1145, 1215, 16, 440, 545, 832, 1204, 2803, 3459, 2, 1661, 1054, 39744, 910, 190, 1719, 21, 1237, 17, 3, 248, 59, 64, 642, 782, 558, 1140, 2, 134, 287, 822, 1505, 768, 6, 30, 2630, 910, 156, 75, 2348, 1, 3, 2707, 341, 45, 2, 341, 3409, 166, 126, 45, 2, 4616, 596, 418, 831, 1017, 274, 21, 1143, 409, 35, 248, 59, 1140, 2, 3, 287, 1, 134, 814, 1373, 20, 910, 404, 2031, 15980, 776, 11, 370, 9, 432, 15, 531, 60, 2, 36104, 2, 12, 140, 5, 390, 30, 1301, 74, 11, 1405, 3, 248, 59, 1140, 2, 12, 43, 97, 2512, 3221, 23, 3, 463, 15, 1127, 1, 1240, 1442, 3340, 19, 551, 1144, 551, 13, 1861, 142, 1140, 10, 41, 5, 8, 142, 43, 1, 134, 187, 1240, 1442, 3340, 7783, 13, 105, 203, 33, 350, 39, 503, 188, 172, 18, 172, 658, 586, 360, 197, 14, 912, 48, 307, 268, 14, 739, 18, 562, 19, 551, 853, 551, 13, 144, 84, 44, 5, 43, 1, 134, 5, 1240, 1442, 3340, 19, 551, 853, 551, 13, 664, 26, 1777, 248, 2121, 6, 40, 925, 4, 5758, 1, 30, 2226, 1753, 15, 5728, 55, 156, 242, 3, 1050, 2349, 10, 383, 3, 248, 59, 1140, 2, 134, 43, 205, 44, 97, 1505, 20, 63, 30, 910, 2391, 910, 15, 5489, 4091, 31, 1249, 19, 551, 1144, 551, 13, 680, 5, 3, 586, 1, 13, 355, 64, 1140, 10, 41, 5, 43, 1, 12, 875, 1101, 77, 1240, 1442, 1222, 114, 272, 309, 17, 7483, 1054, 1, 2612, 2803, 3459, 822, 40, 3355, 9, 57, 17, 6630, 380, 3077, 910, 2432, 3, 30, 1361]",1966.0,28510098,3
Genetic ancestry and prostate cancer susceptibility SNPs in Puerto Rican and African American men.,The Prostate,Prostate,2017-05-24,"The Puerto Rican (PR) population is a racially admixed population that has a high prostate cancer (PCa) mortality rate. We hypothesized in this pilot study that West African Ancestry (WAA) was associated with PCa in this heterogeneous (PR) population. A case/case and case/control study was performed. Controls, 207 African American (AA) and 133 PR were defined as men with no PCa, a serum PSA < 2.5 ng/mL and a negative rectal examination. Cases were patients with pathological specimens from radical prostatectomies (RP) (291 PR and 200 AA). DNA was extracted from whole blood of controls and from paraffin embedded normal seminal vesicle from the RPs. We assessed the association of PCa and aggressiveness with genetic ancestry using an ancestry informative marker panel (AIMs) and Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the association of PCa and aggressiveness with 15 previously PCa associated SNPs using Chi square test. Gleason Score (GS) and tumor stage (TS) were used to define low risk (GS ≤ 7[3 + 4]), TS ≤ pT2) and high risk (GS≥ 7[4 + 3], TS > pT2) PCa. Statistical analyses were done using SAS. No difference in overall percent WAA was found between PR cases and controls. Among PR or AA cases WAA was not associated with disease severity based upon risk group, Gleason score or stage. Among AA controls WAA was significantly higher than in cases. The SNP rs7824364 (chromosome 8q24) PCa risk allele was significantly increased among cases versus controls for both AA (P < 0.0001) and PR (P = 0.0001) men.

Personalizing Adjuvant Therapy for Stage II/III Colorectal Cancer.,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book. American Society of Clinical Oncology. Annual Meeting,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,2017-01-01,"This review focuses on three areas of interest with respect to the treatment of stage II and III colon and rectal cancer, including (1) tailoring adjuvant therapy for the geriatric population, (2) the controversy as to the optimal adjuvant therapy strategy for patients with locoregional rectal cancer and for patients with colorectal resectable metastatic disease, and (3) discussion of the microenvironment, molecular profiling, and the future of adjuvant therapy. It has become evident that age is the strongest predictive factor for receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy, duration of treatment, and risk of treatment-related toxicity. Although incorporating adjuvant chemotherapy for patients who have received neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgery would appear to be a reasonable strategy to improve survivorship as an extrapolation from stage III colon cancer adjuvant trials, attempts at defining the optimal rectal cancer population that would benefit from adjuvant therapy remain elusive. Similarly, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients after resection of metastatic colorectal cancer has not been clearly defined because of very limited data to provide guidance. An understanding of the biologic hallmarks and drivers of metastatic spread as well as the micrometastatic environment is expected to translate into therapeutic strategies tailored to select patients.

Standard fractionation external beam radiotherapy with and without intraoperative radiotherapy for locally recurrent rectal cancer: the role of local therapy in patients with a high competing risk of death from distant disease.,The British journal of radiology,Br J Radiol,2017-06-14,"We sought to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of utilizing radiotherapy (RT) with standard fractionation, with or without intraoperative RT (IORT), to treat locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC). Retrospective review of 25 patients with LRRC treated with standard fractionation RT from 2005 to 2011. 15 patients (60%) had prior pelvic RT and 10 (40%) had synchronous metastases. The median equivalent dose in 2-Gy fractions was 30 and 49.6 Gy in patients with and without prior RT, respectively. 23 patients (92%) received concurrent chemotherapy and 16 (64%) underwent surgical resection. Eight patients (33.3%, four with and four without prior RT) received IORT. A competing risks model was developed to estimate the cumulative incidence of local failure with death treated as a competing event. Median follow-up was 36.9 months after the date of local recurrence. 3-year rates of overall survival (OS), local control (LC) and death with LC were 51.6%, 73.3% and 69.2%, respectively. On multivariable analysis, surgical resection was significantly predictive of improved OS (p < 0.05). If surgical resection were removed from the multivariable model, given the collinearity between IORT delivery and surgical resection, then IORT also became a significant predictor of OS (p < 0.05). Systemic disease at the time of local recurrence was not associated with either LC or OS. No patient had grade ≥3 acute or late toxicity. RT with standard fractionation is safe and effective in the treatment of patients with LRRC, even in patients with significant risk of systemic disease and/or history of prior RT. Advances in knowledge: The utility of RT with standard fractionation, generally with chemotherapy, in the treatment of LRRC is demonstrated. In this high-risk cohort of patients with a 40% incidence of synchronous metastatic disease, surgical resection of the recurrence was the major predictor of OS, though a benefit to IORT was also suggested.

Impact of Recurrence and Salvage Surgery on Survival After Multidisciplinary Treatment of Rectal Cancer.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2017-06-28,"Purpose After preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision for locally advanced rectal cancer, patients who experience local or systemic relapse of disease may be eligible for curative salvage surgery, but the benefit of this surgery has not been fully investigated. The purpose of this study was to characterize recurrence patterns and investigate the impact of salvage surgery on survival in patients with rectal cancer after receiving multidisciplinary treatment. Patients and Methods Patients with locally advanced (cT3-4 or cN+) rectal cancer who were treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision at our institution during 1993 to 2008 were identified. We examined patterns of recurrence location, time to recurrence, treatment factors, and survival. Results A total of 735 patients were included. Tumors were mostly midrectal to lower rectal cancer, with a median distance from the anal verge of 5.0 cm. The most common recurrence site was the lung followed by the liver. Median time to recurrence was shorter in liver-only recurrence (11.2 months) than in lung-only recurrence (18.2 months) or locoregional-only recurrence (24.7 months; P = .001). Salvage surgery was performed in 57% of patients with single-site recurrence and was associated with longer survival after recurrence in patients with lung-only and liver-only recurrence ( P < .001) but not in those with locoregional-only recurrence ( P = .353). Conclusion We found a predilection for lung recurrence in patients with rectal cancer after multidisciplinary treatment.

Calcium intake and risk of colorectal cancer according to expression status of calcium-sensing receptor (CASR).,Gut,Gut,2017-07-04,"Although evidence suggests an inverse association between calcium intake and the risk of colorectal cancer, the mechanisms remain unclear. The calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) is expressed abundantly in normal colonic epithelium and may influence carcinogenesis. We hypothesized that calcium intake might be associated with lower risk of CASR-positive, but not CASR-negative, colorectal cancer. We assessed tumour CASR protein expression using immunohistochemistry in 779 incident colon and rectal cancer cases that developed among 136 249 individuals in the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. Duplication method Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to assess associations of calcium intake with incidence of colorectal adenocarcinoma subtypes by CASR status. Total calcium intake was inversely associated with the risk of developing colorectal cancer (p<sub>trend</sub>=0.01, comparing ≥1200 vs <600 mg/day: multivariable HR=0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.95). For the same comparison, higher total calcium intake was associated with a lower risk of CASR-positive tumours (p<sub>trend</sub>=0.003, multivariable HR=0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.86) but not with CASR-negative tumours (p<sub>trend</sub>=0.67, multivariable HR=1.15, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.78; p<sub>heterogeneity</sub>=0.06 between the CASR subtypes). The stronger inverse associations of calcium intake with CASR-positive but not CASR-negative tumours generally appeared consistent regardless of sex, tumour location and source of calcium.

Neuroendocrine Liver Metastasis: Prognostic Implications of Primary Tumor Site on Patients Undergoing Curative Intent Liver Surgery.,Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,J. Gastrointest. Surg.,2017-07-25,"Neuroendocrine tumors typically arise from pancreatic (PNET) vs. gastrointestinal or thoracic origins (non-PNET). The impact of primary tumor site on long-term prognosis following resection of neuroendocrine liver metastasis (NELM) remains poorly defined. The objective of the current study was to define the association of primary tumor location on prognosis of patients undergoing curative intent liver resection for NELM. Between 1990 and 2014, 421 patients who underwent resection of NELM were identified from a multi-institutional database. Clinicopathological characteristics, operative details, and outcomes were stratified and analyzed by location of the primary tumor (PNET vs. non-PNET). A propensity score-matched analysis was utilized to assess the impact of primary tumor location on long-term survival. Among the 421 patients, 197 (46.8%) patients had NELM from a PNET primary while 224 (53.2%) had a non-PNET primary (small bowel, n = 145; rectal, n = 10; bronchial, n = 22; other, n = 47). There were no differences in tumor burden and tumor site, while presence of extrahepatic disease was more common among patients with non-PNET NELM (extrahepatic disease, PNET NELM, n = 11 27.5% vs. non-PNET NELM, n = 29 72.5%; p = 0.010). Patients with PNET NELM were more likely to have non-functional disease compared with patients who had non-PNET NELM (non-functional, PNET NELM, n = 117 54.9% vs. non-PNET NELM, n = 96 45.1%; p = 0.011). On the final pathological specimen of the resected NELM, patients with PNET NELM were more likely to have a moderately differentiated tumor (59.3%), while patients with non-PNET NELM were more likely to have a poorly differentiated tumor (67.8%) (p = 0.005). Patients with PNET NELM had a worse 5-year DFS and 5-year OS compared with patients who had non-PNET NELM (DFS, PNET 36.2% vs. non-PNET 55.2%; p = 0.001 and OS, PNET 79.5% vs. non-PNET 83.4%; p = 0.008). After propensity score matching, both 5-year DFS and 5-year OS of the PNET and non-PNET groups were comparable (DFS, PNET 46.2% vs. non-PNET 55.9%; p = 0.22 and OS, PNET 81.5% vs. non-PNET 84.3%; p = 0.19). PNET patients more often present with non-functional NELM and moderately differentiated tumors.

A Panel of Methylated MicroRNA Biomarkers for Identifying High-Risk Patients With Ulcerative Colitis-Associated Colorectal Cancer.,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,2017-08-25,"Methylation of specific microRNAs (miRNAs) often occurs in an age-dependent manner, as a field defect in some instances, and may be an early event in colitis-associated carcinogenesis. We aimed to determine whether specific mRNA signature patterns (MIR1, MIR9, MIR124, MIR137, MIR34B/C) could be used to identify patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) who are at increased risk for colorectal neoplasia. We obtained 387 colorectal tissue specimens collected from 238 patients with UC (152 without neoplasia, 17 with dysplasia, and 69 with UC-associated colorectal cancer [UC-CRC]), from 2 independent cohorts in Japan between 2005 and 2015. We quantified methylation of miRNAs by bisulfite pyrosequencing analysis. We analyzed clinical data to determine whether miRNA methylation patterns were associated with age, location, or segment of the colorectum (cecum, transverse colon, and rectum). Differences in tissue miRNA methylation and expression levels were compared among samples and associated with cancer risk using the Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney, and Kruskal-Wallis tests as appropriate. We performed a validation study of samples from 90 patients without UC and 61 patients with UC-associated dysplasia or cancer to confirm the association between specific methylation patterns of miRNAs in non-tumor rectal mucosa from patients with UC at risk of UC-CRC. Among patients with UC without neoplasia, rectal tissues had significantly higher levels of methylation levels of MIR1, MIR9, MIR124, and MIR137 than in proximal mucosa; levels of methylation were associated with age and duration of UC in rectal mucosa. Methylation of all miRNAs was significantly higher in samples from patients with dysplasia or CRC compared with samples from patients without neoplasia. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that methylation levels of miRNAs in rectal mucosa accurately differentiated patients with CRC from those without. Methylation of MIR137 in rectal mucosa was an independent risk factor for UC-CRC. Methylation patterns of a set of miRNAs (panel) could discriminate discriminate UC patients with or without dysplasia or CRC in the evaluation cohort (area under the curve, 0.81) and the validation cohort (area under the curve, 0.78). In evaluation and validation cohorts, we found specific miRNAs to be methylated in rectal mucosal samples from patients with UC with dysplasia or CRC compared with patients without neoplasms.

Association Between Inflammatory Diet Pattern and Risk of Colorectal Carcinoma Subtypes Classified by Immune Responses to Tumor.,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,2017-09-01,"Dietary patterns affect systemic and local intestinal inflammation, which have been linked to colorectal carcinogenesis. Chronic inflammation can interfere with the adaptive immune response. We investigated whether the association of a diet that promotes intestinal inflammation with risk of colorectal carcinoma was stronger for tumors with lower lymphocytic reactions than tumors with higher lymphocytic reactions. We collected data from the molecular pathological epidemiology databases of 2 prospective cohort studies: the Nurses' Health Study (since 1976) and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (since 1986). We used duplication-method time-varying Cox proportional cause-specific hazards regression to assess the association of empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP) score (derived from food frequency questionnaire data) with colorectal carcinoma subtype. Foods that contribute to high EDIP scores include red and processed meats, refined grains, carbonated beverages, and some vegetables; foods that contribute to low EDIP scores include beer, wine, coffee, tea, yellow and leafy vegetables, and fruit juice. Colorectal tissue samples were analyzed histologically for patterns of lymphocytic reactions (Crohn's-like lymphoid reaction, peritumoral lymphocytic reaction, intratumoral periglandular reaction, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes). During follow-up of 124,433 participants, we documented 1311 incident colon and rectal cancer cases with available tissue data. The association between the EDIP and colorectal cancer risk was significant (P<sub>trend</sub> = .02), and varied with degree of peritumoral lymphocytic reaction (P<sub>heterogeneity</sub> < .001). Higher EDIP scores were associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer with an absent or low peritumoral lymphocytic reaction (highest vs lowest EDIP score quintile hazard ratio, 2.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.60-4.23; P<sub>trend</sub> < .001), but not risk of tumors with intermediate or high peritumoral lymphocytic reaction (P<sub>trend</sub> > .80). In 2 prospective cohort studies, we associated inflammatory diets with a higher risk of colorectal cancer subtype that contains little or no peritumoral lymphocytic reaction. These findings suggest that diet-related inflammation might contribute to development of colorectal cancer, by suppressing the adaptive anti-tumor immune response.",Journal Article,872.0,19.0,"Dietary patterns affect systemic and local intestinal inflammation which have been linked to carcinogenesis Chronic inflammation can interfere with the adaptive immune response We investigated whether the association of a diet that promotes intestinal inflammation with risk of carcinoma was stronger for tumors with lower lymphocytic reactions than tumors with higher lymphocytic reactions We collected data from the molecular pathological epidemiology databases of 2 prospective cohort studies the Nurses Health Study since 1976 and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study since 1986 We used duplication-method time-varying Cox proportional cause-specific hazards regression to assess the association of empirical dietary inflammatory pattern EDIP score derived from food frequency questionnaire data with carcinoma subtype Foods that contribute to high EDIP scores include red and processed meats refined grains carbonated beverages and some vegetables foods that contribute to low EDIP scores include beer wine coffee tea yellow and leafy vegetables and fruit juice tissue samples were analyzed histologically for patterns of lymphocytic reactions Crohn's-like lymphoid reaction peritumoral lymphocytic reaction intratumoral periglandular reaction and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes During follow-up of 124,433 participants we documented 1311 incident and cancer cases with available tissue data The association between the EDIP and cancer risk was significant P sub trend /sub .02 and varied with degree of peritumoral lymphocytic reaction P sub heterogeneity /sub .001 Higher EDIP scores were associated with increased risk of cancer with an absent or low peritumoral lymphocytic reaction highest vs lowest EDIP score quintile hazard ratio 2.60 95 confidence interval 1.60-4.23 P sub trend /sub .001 but not risk of tumors with intermediate or high peritumoral lymphocytic reaction P sub trend /sub .80 In 2 prospective cohort studies we associated inflammatory diets with a higher risk of cancer subtype that contains little or no peritumoral lymphocytic reaction These findings suggest that diet-related inflammation might contribute to development of cancer by suppressing the adaptive anti-tumor immune response",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[2013, 764, 1158, 403, 2, 293, 3077, 1815, 92, 47, 85, 1199, 6, 1719, 442, 1815, 122, 6178, 5, 3, 2454, 250, 51, 21, 565, 317, 3, 248, 1, 8, 2453, 17, 2148, 3077, 1815, 5, 43, 1, 134, 10, 3355, 9, 57, 5, 280, 1193, 2428, 76, 57, 5, 142, 1193, 2428, 21, 786, 74, 29, 3, 219, 1301, 1284, 2348, 1, 18, 482, 180, 94, 3, 2707, 341, 45, 1192, 8586, 2, 3, 341, 3409, 166, 126, 45, 1192, 3751, 21, 95, 4616, 596, 98, 2990, 418, 831, 708, 112, 1017, 320, 6, 423, 3, 248, 1, 7273, 2013, 1291, 1177, 15815, 368, 526, 29, 1773, 675, 1770, 74, 5, 134, 875, 7484, 17, 1248, 6, 64, 15815, 703, 643, 3422, 2, 5232, 19777, 5332, 16465, 46955, 14321, 2, 476, 6024, 7484, 17, 1248, 6, 154, 15815, 703, 643, 17839, 12414, 8980, 8854, 17826, 2, 31825, 6024, 2, 7870, 11512, 246, 347, 11, 311, 2161, 9, 764, 1, 1193, 2428, 23387, 733, 2303, 1329, 5432, 1193, 1329, 2074, 21582, 1329, 2, 30, 2097, 1594, 190, 166, 126, 1, 2834, 13224, 776, 21, 1405, 37340, 2631, 2, 12, 140, 5, 390, 246, 74, 3, 248, 59, 3, 15815, 2, 12, 43, 10, 93, 19, 551, 853, 551, 588, 2, 2051, 5, 1444, 1, 5432, 1193, 1329, 19, 551, 1144, 551, 144, 142, 15815, 703, 11, 41, 5, 101, 43, 1, 12, 5, 35, 3269, 15, 154, 5432, 1193, 1329, 1076, 105, 2101, 15815, 368, 5950, 360, 197, 18, 335, 48, 307, 268, 14, 335, 39, 382, 19, 551, 853, 551, 144, 84, 44, 43, 1, 57, 5, 919, 15, 64, 5432, 1193, 1329, 19, 551, 853, 551, 493, 4, 18, 482, 180, 94, 21, 41, 1291, 6906, 5, 8, 142, 43, 1, 12, 875, 17, 4862, 1215, 15, 77, 5432, 1193, 1329, 46, 272, 309, 17, 2453, 139, 1815, 822, 1248, 6, 193, 1, 12, 20, 4669, 3, 2454, 312, 30, 250, 51]",2222.0,28865736,67

Individualized Treatment Sequencing Selection Contributes to Optimized Survival in Patients with Rectal Cancer and Synchronous Liver Metastases.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2017-09-19,"The optimal treatment sequence for patients with advanced rectal cancer and synchronous resectable liver metastases is controversial. We examined the outcomes associated with an individualized selection of classic, reversed, or combined approaches. Between 1999 and 2014, 268 patients with rectal cancer and synchronous liver-only metastases underwent curative-intent multimodality therapy. Demographics and tumor and treatment details were reviewed. Survival outcomes were examined across treatment sequences and time periods (1999-2003, 2004-2008, and 2009-2014). Overall, 150 (56.0%) patients underwent primary tumor resection first ('classic' approach), 44 (16.4%) patients underwent simultaneous resection of the primary and liver metastases ('combined' approach), and 74 (27.6%) patients underwent liver resection first ('reversed' approach). Patients who underwent the reversed approach had more liver metastases (3 [2-5]) at presentation (vs. 1 [1-2.5] in the combined approach or 1 [1-3] in the classic approach; p < 0.001). Over time (from 1999 to 2003, to 2009 to 2014), both patients undergoing curative-intent treatment (62-122 patients) and the relative proportion of patients undergoing the reversed approach (6.4-37.7%) significantly increased.

Tumor PDCD1LG2 (PD-L2) Expression and the Lymphocytic Reaction to Colorectal Cancer.,Cancer immunology research,Cancer Immunol Res,2017-10-16,"Expression of the immune checkpoint ligand CD274 (programmed cell death 1 ligand 1, PD-L1, from gene <i>CD274</i>) contributes to suppression of antitumor T cell-mediated immune response in various tumor types. However, the role of PDCD1LG2 (PD-L2, CD273, from gene <i>PDCD1LG2</i>) in the tumor microenvironment remains unclear. We hypothesized that tumor PDCD1LG2 expression might be inversely associated with lymphocytic reactions to colorectal cancer. We examined tumor PDCD1LG2 expression by IHC in 823 colon and rectal carcinoma cases within two U.S.-nationwide cohort studies and categorized tumors into quartiles according to the percentage of PDCD1LG2-expressing carcinoma cells. We conducted multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis to assess the associations of tumor PDCD1LG2 expression with Crohn-like lymphoid reaction, peritumoral lymphocytic reaction, intratumoral periglandular reaction, or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, controlling for potential confounders, including microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, long-interspersed nucleotide element-1 methylation, and <i>KRAS, BRAF</i>, and <i>PIK3CA</i> mutations. Tumor PDCD1LG2 expression was inversely associated with Crohn-like lymphoid reaction (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub> = 0.0003). For a unit increase in the three-tiered ordinal categories of Crohn-like lymphoid reaction, a multivariable OR in the highest (vs. lowest) quartile of the percentage of PDCD1LG2-expressing tumor cells was 0.38 (95% confidence interval, 0.22-0.67). Tumor PDCD1LG2 expression was not associated with peritumoral lymphocytic reaction, intratumoral periglandular reaction, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or patient survival (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub> > 0.13). Thus, tumor PDCD1LG2 expression is inversely associated with Crohn-like lymphoid reaction to colorectal cancer, suggesting a possible role of PDCD1LG2-expressing tumor cells in inhibiting the development of tertiary lymphoid tissues during colorectal carcinogenesis. <i>Cancer Immunol Res; 5(11); 1046-55. ©2017 AACR</i>.",Journal Article,827.0,14.0,Expression of the immune checkpoint ligand CD274 programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 PD-L1 from gene i CD274 /i contributes to suppression of antitumor T cell-mediated immune response in various tumor types However the role of PDCD1LG2 PD-L2 CD273 from gene i PDCD1LG2 /i in the tumor microenvironment remains unclear We hypothesized that tumor PDCD1LG2 expression might be inversely associated with lymphocytic reactions to cancer We examined tumor PDCD1LG2 expression by IHC in 823 and carcinoma cases within two U.S.-nationwide cohort studies and categorized tumors into quartiles according to the percentage of PDCD1LG2-expressing carcinoma cells We conducted multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis to assess the associations of tumor PDCD1LG2 expression with Crohn-like lymphoid reaction peritumoral lymphocytic reaction intratumoral periglandular reaction or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes controlling for potential confounders including microsatellite instability CpG island methylator phenotype long-interspersed nucleotide element-1 methylation and i KRAS BRAF /i and i PIK3CA /i mutations Tumor PDCD1LG2 expression was inversely associated with Crohn-like lymphoid reaction i P /i sub trend /sub 0.0003 For a unit increase in the three-tiered ordinal categories of Crohn-like lymphoid reaction a multivariable OR in the highest vs. lowest quartile of the percentage of PDCD1LG2-expressing tumor cells was 0.38 95 confidence interval 0.22-0.67 Tumor PDCD1LG2 expression was not associated with peritumoral lymphocytic reaction intratumoral periglandular reaction tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or patient survival i P /i sub trend /sub 0.13 Thus tumor PDCD1LG2 expression is inversely associated with Crohn-like lymphoid reaction to cancer suggesting a possible role of PDCD1LG2-expressing tumor cells in inhibiting the development of tertiary lymphoid tissues during carcinogenesis i Cancer Immunol Res 5 11 1046-55 ©2017 AACR /i,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[55, 1, 3, 250, 986, 1232, 10511, 1846, 31, 273, 14, 1232, 14, 333, 729, 29, 145, 70, 10511, 70, 2444, 6, 1332, 1, 579, 102, 31, 517, 250, 51, 4, 747, 30, 630, 137, 3, 200, 1, 14047, 333, 5111, 35539, 29, 145, 70, 14047, 70, 4, 3, 30, 995, 469, 1200, 21, 1237, 17, 30, 14047, 55, 822, 40, 2659, 41, 5, 1193, 2428, 6, 12, 21, 409, 30, 14047, 55, 20, 1289, 4, 12613, 2, 134, 140, 262, 100, 1767, 695, 5405, 180, 94, 2, 2320, 57, 237, 6028, 768, 6, 3, 1150, 1, 14047, 1046, 134, 37, 21, 426, 658, 9608, 812, 320, 65, 6, 423, 3, 685, 1, 30, 14047, 55, 5, 11612, 733, 2303, 1329, 5432, 1193, 1329, 2074, 21582, 1329, 15, 30, 2097, 1594, 1893, 9, 174, 4423, 141, 2226, 1753, 2075, 3454, 5440, 1005, 319, 11038, 1579, 4467, 14, 569, 2, 70, 723, 566, 70, 2, 70, 1506, 70, 138, 30, 14047, 55, 10, 2659, 41, 5, 11612, 733, 2303, 1329, 70, 19, 70, 551, 853, 551, 13, 4418, 9, 8, 2712, 344, 4, 3, 169, 14526, 9608, 1996, 1, 11612, 733, 2303, 1329, 8, 658, 15, 4, 3, 1076, 105, 2101, 3708, 1, 3, 1150, 1, 14047, 1046, 30, 37, 10, 13, 519, 48, 307, 268, 13, 350, 13, 598, 30, 14047, 55, 10, 44, 41, 5, 5432, 1193, 1329, 2074, 21582, 1329, 30, 2097, 1594, 15, 69, 25, 70, 19, 70, 551, 853, 551, 13, 233, 631, 30, 14047, 55, 16, 2659, 41, 5, 11612, 733, 2303, 1329, 6, 12, 802, 8, 899, 200, 1, 14047, 1046, 30, 37, 4, 2062, 3, 193, 1, 2557, 2303, 742, 190, 1719, 70, 12, 8557, 1936, 33, 175, 29394, 614, 3194, 1630, 70]",1948.0,29038297,49

Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Rectal GISTs represented 7.1% of 663 primary GISTs. The findings showed 17 patients in the pre-imatinib era and 30 patients in the imatinib era.

Mismatch Repair Deficiency Testing in Patients With Colorectal Cancer and Nonadherence to Testing Guidelines in Young Adults.,JAMA oncology,JAMA Oncol,2018-02-08,"Mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency of DNA has been observed in up to 15% of sporadic colorectal cancers (CRCs) and is a characteristic feature of Lynch syndrome, which has a higher incidence in young adults (age, <50 years) with CRC. Mismatch repair deficiency can be due to germline mutations or epigenetic inactivation, affects prognosis and response to systemic therapy, and results in unrepaired repetitive DNA sequences, which increases the risk of multiple malignant tumors. To evaluate the utilization of MMR deficiency testing in adults with CRC and analyze nonadherence to long-standing testing guidelines in younger adults using a contemporary national data set to help identify potential risk factors for nonadherence to newly implemented universal testing guidelines. Adult (age, <30 to ≥70 years) and, of these, younger adult (<30 to 49 years) patients with invasive colorectal adenocarcinoma diagnosed between 2010 and 2012 and known MMR deficiency testing status were identified using the National Cancer Database. The study was conducted from March 16, 2016, to March 1, 2017. Patient sociodemographic, facility, tumor, and treatment characteristics. The primary outcome of interest was receipt of MMR deficiency testing. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of testing in adult and/or young adult patients. A total of 152 993 adults with CRC were included in the study (78 579 [51.4%] men; mean [SD] age, 66.9 [13.9] years). Of these patients, only 43 143 (28.2%) underwent MMR deficiency testing; the proportion of patients tested increased between 2010 and 2012 (22.3% vs 33.1%; P<.001). Among 17 218 younger adult patients with CRC, only 7422 (43.1%) underwent MMR deficiency testing; the proportion tested increased between 2010 and 2012 (36.1% vs 48.0%; P < .001).

Health Reform and Utilization of High-Volume Hospitals for Complex Cancer Operations.,Journal of oncology practice,J Oncol Pract,2017-11-20,"Underinsured patients are less likely to receive complex cancer operations at hospitals with high surgical volumes (high-volume hospitals, or HVHs), which contributes to disparities in care. To date, the impact of insurance coverage expansion on site of complex cancer surgery remains unknown. Using the 2006 Massachusetts coverage expansion as a natural experiment, we searched the Hospital Cost and Utilization Project state inpatient databases for Massachusetts and control states (New York, New Jersey, and Florida) between 2001 and 2011 to evaluate changes in the utilization of HVHs for resections of bladder, esophageal, stomach, pancreatic, rectal, or lung cancer after the expansion of insurance coverage. We studied nonelderly, adult patients with private insurance and those with government-subsidized or self-pay (GSSP) coverage with a difference-in-differences framework. We studied 11,687 patients in Massachusetts and 56,300 patients in control states. Compared with control states, the 2006 Massachusetts insurance expansion was associated with a 14% increased rate of surgical intervention for GSSP patients (incident rate ratio, 1.14; P = .015), but there was no significant change in the probability of GSSP patients undergoing surgery at an HVH (1.0 percentage-point increase; P = .710). The reform was associated with no change in the uninsured payer-mix at HVHs (0.6 percentage-point increase; P = .244) and with a 5.1 percentage-point decrease for the uninsured payer mix at low-volume hospitals ( P < .001).

Prognostic Value of Clinical vs Pathologic Stage in Rectal Cancer Patients Receiving Neoadjuvant Therapy.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2018-05-01,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiation is currently standard of care in stage II-III rectal cancer, resulting in tumor downstaging for patients with treatment-responsive disease. However, the prognosis of the downstaged patient remains controversial. This work critically analyzes the relative contribution of pre- and post-therapy staging to the anticipated survival of downstaged patients. The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried for patients with rectal cancer treated with transabdominal resection between 2004 and 2014. Stage II-III patients downstaged with neoadjuvant radiation were compared with stage I patients treated with definitive resection alone. Patients with positive surgical margins were excluded. Overall survival was evaluated using both Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox proportional hazards models. All statistical tests were two-sided. A total of 44 320 patients were eligible for analysis. Survival was equivalent for patients presenting with cT1N0 disease undergoing resection (mean survival = 113.0 months, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 110.8 to 115.3 months) compared with those downstaged to pT1N0 from both cT3N0 (mean survival = 114.9 months, 95% CI = 110.4 to 119.3 months, P = .12) and cT3N1 disease (mean survival = 115.4 months, 95% CI = 110.1 to 120.7 months, P = .22). Survival statistically significantly improved in patients downstaged to pT2N0 from cT3N0 disease (mean survival = 109.0 months, 95% CI = 106.7 to 111.2 months, P < .001) and cT3N1 (mean survival = 112.8 months, 95% CI = 110.0 to 115.7 months, P < .001), compared with cT2N0 patients undergoing resection alone (mean survival = 100.0 months, 95% CI = 97.5 to 102.5 months).

Classifying Colorectal Cancer by Tumor Location Rather than Sidedness Highlights a Continuum in Mutation Profiles and Consensus Molecular Subtypes.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2017-11-27,"<b>Purpose:</b> Colorectal cancers are classified as right/left-sided based on whether they occur before/after the splenic flexure, with established differences in molecular subtypes and outcomes. However, it is unclear if this division is optimal and whether precise tumor location provides further information.<b>Experimental Design:</b> In 1,876 patients with colorectal cancer, we compared mutation prevalence and overall survival (OS) according to side and location. Consensus molecular subtype (CMS) was compared in a separate cohort of 608 patients.<b>Results:</b> Mutation prevalence differed by side and location for <i>TP53, KRAS, BRAFV600, PIK3CA, SMAD4, CTNNB1, GNAS</i>, and <i>PTEN</i> Within left- and right-sided tumors, there remained substantial variations in mutation rates. For example, within right-sided tumors, <i>RAS</i> mutations decreased from 70% for cecal, to 43% for hepatic flexure location (<i>P</i> = 0.0001), while <i>BRAF</i>V600 mutations increased from 10% to 22% between the same locations (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). Within left-sided tumors, the sigmoid and rectal region had more <i>TP53</i> mutations (<i>P</i> = 0.027), less <i>PIK3CA</i> (<i>P</i> = 0.0009), <i>BRAF</i> (<i>P</i> = 0.0033), or <i>CTNNB1</i> mutations (<i>P</i> < 0.0001), and less MSI (<i>P</i> < 0.0001) than other left-sided locations. Despite this, a left/right division preceding the transverse colon maximized prognostic differences by side and transverse colon tumors had K-modes mutation clustering that appeared more left than right sided. CMS profiles showed a decline in CMS1 and CMS3 and rise in CMS2 prevalence moving distally.<b>Conclusions:</b> Current right/left classifications may not fully recapitulate regional variations in tumor biology. Specifically, the sigmoid-rectal region appears unique and the transverse colon is distinct from other right-sided locations. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 24(5); 1062-72. ©2017 AACR</i><i>See related commentary by Dienstmann, p. 989</i>.",Journal Article,785.0,45.0,"b Purpose /b cancers are classified as right/left-sided based on whether they occur before/after the splenic flexure with established differences in molecular subtypes and outcomes However it is unclear if this division is optimal and whether precise tumor location provides further information. b Experimental Design /b In 1,876 patients with cancer we compared mutation prevalence and overall survival OS according to side and location Consensus molecular subtype CMS was compared in a separate cohort of 608 patients. b Results /b Mutation prevalence differed by side and location for i TP53 KRAS BRAFV600 PIK3CA SMAD4 CTNNB1 GNAS /i and i PTEN /i Within left- and right-sided tumors there remained substantial variations in mutation rates For example within right-sided tumors i RAS /i mutations decreased from 70 for cecal to 43 for hepatic flexure location i P /i 0.0001 while i BRAF /i V600 mutations increased from 10 to 22 between the same locations i P /i 0.0001 Within left-sided tumors the sigmoid and region had more i TP53 /i mutations i P /i 0.027 less i PIK3CA /i i P /i 0.0009 i BRAF /i i P /i 0.0033 or i CTNNB1 /i mutations i P /i 0.0001 and less MSI i P /i 0.0001 than other left-sided locations Despite this a left/right division preceding the transverse maximized prognostic differences by side and transverse tumors had K-modes mutation clustering that appeared more left than right sided CMS profiles showed a decline in CMS1 and CMS3 and rise in CMS2 prevalence moving distally. b Conclusions /b Current right/left classifications may not fully recapitulate regional variations in tumor biology Specifically the sigmoid-rectal region appears unique and the transverse is distinct from other right-sided locations i Clin Cancer Res 24 5 1062-72 ©2017 AACR /i i See related commentary by Dienstmann p. 989 /i",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[132, 743, 132, 163, 32, 1373, 22, 1913, 1712, 1689, 90, 23, 317, 491, 1271, 348, 50, 3, 5237, 15997, 5, 635, 362, 4, 219, 814, 2, 123, 137, 192, 16, 1200, 492, 26, 5750, 16, 665, 2, 317, 3260, 30, 1147, 777, 195, 487, 132, 1560, 771, 132, 4, 14, 16436, 7, 5, 12, 21, 72, 258, 1078, 2, 63, 25, 118, 768, 6, 1152, 2, 1147, 1391, 219, 875, 9914, 10, 72, 4, 8, 2282, 180, 1, 11768, 7, 132, 99, 132, 258, 1078, 2512, 20, 1152, 2, 1147, 9, 70, 1206, 723, 16156, 1506, 4248, 4485, 8624, 70, 2, 70, 820, 70, 262, 1712, 2, 1913, 1689, 57, 125, 958, 1281, 2293, 4, 258, 151, 9, 2685, 262, 1913, 1689, 57, 70, 1102, 70, 138, 340, 29, 431, 9, 19603, 6, 601, 9, 939, 15997, 1147, 70, 19, 70, 13, 488, 369, 70, 566, 70, 4557, 138, 101, 29, 79, 6, 350, 59, 3, 827, 4069, 70, 19, 70, 13, 488, 262, 1712, 1689, 57, 3, 9356, 2, 1053, 42, 80, 70, 1206, 70, 138, 70, 19, 70, 13, 4523, 299, 70, 1506, 70, 70, 19, 70, 13, 7946, 70, 566, 70, 70, 19, 70, 13, 19589, 15, 70, 4485, 70, 138, 70, 19, 70, 13, 488, 2, 299, 1494, 70, 19, 70, 13, 488, 76, 127, 1712, 1689, 4069, 550, 26, 8, 1712, 1913, 5750, 5892, 3, 8575, 14440, 177, 362, 20, 1152, 2, 8575, 57, 42, 1634, 8256, 258, 3147, 17, 2121, 80, 1712, 76, 1913, 1689, 9914, 1241, 224, 8, 1858, 4, 29722, 2, 36114, 2, 3693, 4, 36113, 1078, 8324, 17743, 132, 2130, 132, 291, 1913, 1712, 5787, 68, 44, 1910, 7746, 951, 2293, 4, 30, 891, 1225, 3, 9356, 21092, 1053, 1233, 991, 2, 3, 8575, 16, 834, 29, 127, 1913, 1689, 4069, 70, 2459, 12, 1936, 259, 33, 23421, 720, 3194, 1630, 70, 70, 3764, 139, 4662, 20, 71670, 19, 17318, 70]",1831.0,29180604,211
The Impact of Primary Tumor Location on Long-Term Survival in Patients Undergoing Hepatic Resection for Metastatic Colon Cancer.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2017-11-27,"The impact of primary tumor location on overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and long-term outcomes has not been well established in patients undergoing potentially curative resection of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). A single-institution database was queried for initial resections for CRLM 1992-2004. Primary tumor location determined by chart review (right = cecum to transverse; left = splenic flexure to sigmoid). Rectal cancer (distal 16 cm), multiple primaries, and unknown location were excluded. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods were used. Cure was defined as actual 10-year survival with either no recurrence or resected recurrence with at least 3 years of disease-free follow-up. A total of 907 patients were included with a median follow-up of 11 years; 578 patients (64%) had left-sided and 329 (36%) right-sided primaries. Median OS for patients with a left-sided primary was 5.2 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.6-6.0) versus 3.6 years (95% CI 3.2-4.2) for right-sided (p = 0.004). On multivariable analysis, the hazard ratio for right-sided tumors was 1.22 (95% CI 1.02-1.45, p = 0.028) after adjusting for common clinicopathologic factors. Median RFS was marginally different stratified by primary location (1.3 vs. 1.7 years; p = 0.065). On multivariable analysis, location of primary was not significantly associated with RFS (p = 0.105). Observed cure rates were 22% for left-sided and 20% for right-sided tumors.

A prospective randomized trial comparing capecitabine-based chemoradiotherapy with 5-FU-based chemoradiotherapy in neoadjuvant setting in locally advanced carcinoma rectum.,Indian journal of cancer,Indian J Cancer,,"Fluorouracil (FU)based chemoradiotherapy is regarded as a standard perioperative treatment in locally advanced rectal cancer. Capecitabine is an oral fluoropyrimidine that generates 5FU preferentially at the tumor site by exploiting the higher activity of the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase in tumor tissue compared with healthy tissue. As an oral agent, capecitabine can be administered in the outpatient setting, potentially providing FU exposure similar to a lowdose continuous infusion of 5FU. To compare capecitabine with 5FU, with regard to efficacy and toxicity when used in neoadjuvant setting along with radiotherapy for locally advanced carcinoma rectum. Thirty patients were enrolled, 14 in 5FU and 16 in capecitabine arm. All patients were planned for 45 Gy/25#/5 weeks pelvic radiotherapy followed by a boost of 5.4 Gy/3#/3 days. 5FU was prescribed at a dose of 500 mg/m2 #1-#5 and #21-#25 of RT and capecitabine was given at 1650 mg/m2 on RT days throughout the course of radiotherapy. A magnetic resonance imaging/computerized tomography scan was done at the start of treatment and 1 month after completion of treatment, followed by surgery. Toxicity was assessed weekly during treatment and on the first followup. Response rates and toxicity profile of capecitabinebased cathode ray tube (CRT) was similar to 5FUbased CRT with nonsignificant P values.

Assessment of Ileostomy Output Using Telemedicine: A Feasibility Trial.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2018-01-01,"Ileostomies are a routine part of the care of patients with rectal cancer, but are associated with significant risk for dehydration, readmission, and acute kidney injury. Telemedicine has proven beneficial in decreasing readmission in chronic medical illnesses, but its utility in patients with an ileostomy is not well studied. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of televideoconferencing in the assessment of ileostomy output. An institutional review board-approved, prospective clinical trial was conducted at a single institution from November 2014 through December 2015. The study was conducted in a single, large academic medical center. Patients >18 years of age undergoing surgery with plans for ileostomy were eligible. Televideoconference assessments of ileostomy output and the need for medical intervention were conducted during the postoperative stay and compared with in-person assessment. The primary end point of the trial was the feasibility of using teleconferencing to assess the need for medical intervention, defined as 90% agreement between telemedicine and in-person assessments. Secondary end points included patient/provider satisfaction, and correlative studies examined dehydration events and readmission. Twenty-seven patients underwent 44 teleconferencing assessments of ileostomy output. Compared with in-person treatment decisions, there was a 95% match (95% CI, 85%-99%). The readmission rate for the study participants was 31%, and 18% experienced dehydration events. Both patients and faculty responded favorably to surveys regarding the use of telemedicine in the perioperative period. The study is limited by its in-hospital use of technology and small sample size. Televideoconference evaluation is a feasible, reliable means of assessing ileostomy output with high patient and physician acceptance. Our pilot study provides rationale for further study in the postdischarge setting for patients with ileostomies. The incorporation of televideoconference assessment within a teledischarge program may enable early intervention to improve patient outcomes.

Phys.,2017-10-12,"To report the efficacy, physician-reported toxicity, and patient-reported outcomes of men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer after brachytherapy in a prospective phase 2 trial. This prospective phase 2 trial involved 300 patients with previously untreated prostate cancer treated from 2006 through 2013. Eligible patients had ≤cT2b (T3 excluded according to magnetic resonance imaging), Gleason score (GS) 6 with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level 10-15 ng/mL, or GS 7 with PSA <10 ng/mL, and were treated with prostate brachytherapy (without hormonal therapy). Median patient age was 64.9 years; 3.7% had GS 6, 78.7% had GS 7 (3+4), and 17.7% had GS 7 (4+3). Median follow-up time was 5.1 years. Median PSA at 5 years was 0.01 ng/mL (range, 0-6.0 ng/mL). Ten biochemical failures occurred, for a 5-year freedom from biochemical failure rate of 97.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 95.1-99.5), and 16 patients died, only 1 from prostate cancer, for 5-year rates of overall and biochemical progression-free survival of 94.9% (95% CI, 92.1-97.9) and 92.7% (95% CI, 89.3-96.2%). Four patients had late grade 3 genitourinary toxicity, and 2 patients had late grade 3 rectal toxicity; no grade 4 or 5 toxicity was observed.

Health-Seeking Behavior and Barriers to Care in Patients With Rectal Bleeding in Nigeria.,Journal of global oncology,J Glob Oncol,2017-02-01,"Purpose Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence rates are steadily increasing in Nigeria. Organized screening is still largely unused because of financial and logistical barriers; most CRCs are detected by symptoms. One symptom of CRC is rectal bleeding. This study sought to determine health-seeking behavior and barriers to care in patients with rectal bleeding in Nigeria. This study also surveyed physicians to determine major breakdowns in access to care. Methods The recruitment process for this study involved patients referred for colonoscopy because of rectal bleeding as well as response to a media advertisement for a free colonoscopy. Physicians were recruited at the African Research Group for Oncology meeting. Patient responses were scored on the basis of knowledge of rectal bleeding. The physician questionnaire was supporting information and mainly descriptive in nature. Results A total of 82 patients and 45 physicians participated in this study. Less than 40% of patients knew that rectal bleeding could be caused by cancer. Major barriers to care were resolution of the symptom (42%), no consideration of the bleeding as problematic (40%), and financial constraint (22%). Education was strongly correlated with knowledge of rectal bleeding and health-seeking behavior. Although physicians regularly saw patients with rectal bleeding, most of them provided a differential diagnosis of hemorrhoids and few referred patients for colonoscopy. Conclusion General awareness about the signs of colorectal cancer is lacking. This demonstrates the strong need for patient education programs about this issue. Physicians should also receive additional training on differentiation of a potential cancer diagnosis from something more benign, such as hemorrhoids.",Journal Article,1084.0,6.0,Purpose cancer CRC incidence rates are steadily increasing in Nigeria Organized screening is still largely unused because of financial and logistical barriers most CRCs are detected by symptoms One symptom of CRC is bleeding This study sought to determine health-seeking behavior and barriers to care in patients with bleeding in Nigeria This study also surveyed physicians to determine major breakdowns in access to care Methods The recruitment process for this study involved patients referred for colonoscopy because of bleeding as well as response to a media advertisement for a free colonoscopy Physicians were recruited at the African Research Group for Oncology meeting Patient responses were scored on the basis of knowledge of bleeding The physician questionnaire was supporting information and mainly descriptive in nature Results A total of 82 patients and 45 physicians participated in this study Less than 40 of patients knew that bleeding could be caused by cancer Major barriers to care were resolution of the symptom 42 no consideration of the bleeding as problematic 40 and financial constraint 22 Education was strongly correlated with knowledge of bleeding and health-seeking behavior Although physicians regularly saw patients with bleeding most of them provided a differential diagnosis of hemorrhoids and few referred patients for colonoscopy Conclusion General awareness about the signs of cancer is lacking This demonstrates the strong need for patient education programs about this issue Physicians should also receive additional training on differentiation of a potential cancer diagnosis from something more benign such as hemorrhoids,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[743, 12, 590, 287, 151, 32, 7025, 602, 4, 21575, 7511, 453, 16, 1234, 1733, 22995, 408, 1, 3021, 2, 9773, 2160, 96, 4184, 32, 530, 20, 507, 104, 934, 1, 590, 16, 2294, 26, 45, 990, 6, 223, 341, 5734, 1710, 2, 2160, 6, 165, 4, 7, 5, 2294, 4, 21575, 26, 45, 120, 3696, 1261, 6, 223, 458, 31075, 4, 1655, 6, 165, 636, 3, 3202, 1129, 9, 26, 45, 646, 7, 1995, 9, 3996, 408, 1, 2294, 22, 149, 22, 51, 6, 8, 4769, 50771, 9, 8, 115, 3996, 1261, 11, 2619, 28, 3, 1410, 389, 87, 9, 413, 2238, 69, 253, 11, 3179, 23, 3, 877, 1, 922, 1, 2294, 3, 1473, 1770, 10, 1912, 487, 2, 2615, 3778, 4, 2202, 99, 8, 181, 1, 878, 7, 2, 512, 1261, 3025, 4, 26, 45, 299, 76, 327, 1, 7, 15655, 17, 2294, 359, 40, 1546, 20, 12, 458, 2160, 6, 165, 11, 2125, 1, 3, 934, 595, 77, 2415, 1, 3, 2294, 22, 6594, 327, 2, 3021, 11482, 350, 1848, 10, 1327, 438, 5, 922, 1, 2294, 2, 341, 5734, 1710, 242, 1261, 7469, 9257, 7, 5, 2294, 96, 1, 1370, 1052, 8, 1777, 147, 1, 34106, 2, 1021, 1995, 7, 9, 3996, 1221, 1083, 3310, 545, 3, 3408, 1, 12, 16, 1941, 26, 1902, 3, 1082, 594, 9, 69, 1848, 2251, 545, 26, 2537, 1261, 257, 120, 560, 402, 1741, 23, 910, 1, 8, 174, 12, 147, 29, 29837, 80, 1002, 225, 22, 34106]",1661.0,29244996,644

Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agent During Pelvic MRI: Contribution to Patient Management in Rectal Cancer.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2018-02-01,"Few publications exist regarding gadolinium-enhanced sequences in rectal MRI. None have evaluated its potential impact on patient management. This study aimed to assess whether gadolinium-enhanced sequences, including dynamic contrast enhancement, change radiologic interpretation and clinical management of rectal cancer. This is a retrospective analysis of 100 rectal MRIs (50 baseline and 50 postneoadjuvant treatment), both without and with gadolinium-enhanced sequences. Treatment plans were rendered based on each radiologic interpretation for each case by a single experienced surgeon. Differences in radiologic interpretation and management were statistically analyzed. The study was conducted at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Patients undergoing rectal MRI between 2011 and 2015 for baseline tumor staging and/or postneoadjuvant restaging were included. Primary outcome measures were changes in radiologic tumor stage, tumor margins, and surgical planning with the use of gadolinium at baseline and postneoadjuvant time points. At baseline, tumor downstaging occurred in 8 (16%) of 50 and upstaging in 4 (8%) of 50 with gadolinium. Postneoadjuvant treatment, upstaging occurred in 1 (2%) of 50 from T2 to T3a. At baseline, mean distances from tumor to anorectal ring, anal verge, and mesorectal fascia were not statistically different with gadolinium. However, in 7 patients, differences could have resulted in treatment changes, accounted for by changes in relationships to anterior peritoneal reflection (n = 4), anorectal ring (n = 2), or anal verge (n = 1). Postneoadjuvant treatment, distances to anorectal ring and anal verge (in centimeters) were statistically smaller with gadolinium (p = 0.0017 and p = 0.0151) but could not have resulted in clinically significant treatment changes. This study was limited by its retrospective design. The use of gadolinium at baseline MRI could have altered treatment in 24% of patients because of differences in tumor stage or position. Postneoadjuvant treatment, gadolinium resulted in statistically smaller distances to sphincters, which could influence surgical decision for sphincter-preserving rectal resection.

Targeting HER2 in colorectal cancer: The landscape of amplification and short variant mutations in ERBB2 and ERBB3.,Cancer,Cancer,2018-01-16,"In contrast to lung cancer, few precision treatments are available for colorectal cancer (CRC). One rapidly emerging treatment target in CRC is ERBB2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]). Oncogenic alterations in HER2, or its dimerization partner HER3, can underlie sensitivity to HER2-targeted therapies. In this study, 8887 CRC cases were evaluated by comprehensive genomic profiling for genomic alterations in 315 cancer-related genes, tumor mutational burden, and microsatellite instability. This cohort included both colonic (7599 cases; 85.5%) and rectal (1288 cases; 14.5%) adenocarcinomas. A total of 569 mCRCs were positive for ERBB2 (429 cases; 4.8%) and/or ERBB3 (148 cases; 1.7%) and featured ERBB amplification, short variant alterations, or a combination of the 2. High tumor mutational burden (≥20 mutations/Mb) was significantly more common in ERBB-mutated samples, and ERBB3-mutated CRCs were significantly more likely to have high microsatellite instability (P<.002). Alterations affecting KRAS (27.3%) were significantly underrepresented in ERBB2-amplified samples compared with wild-type CRC samples (51.8%), and ERBB2- or ERBB3-mutated samples (49.0% and 60.8%, respectively) (P<.01). Other significant differences in mutation frequency were observed for genes in the PI3K/MTOR and mismatch repair pathways. Although observed less often than in breast or upper gastrointestinal carcinomas, indications for which anti-HER2 therapies are approved, the percentage of CRC with ERBB genomic alterations is significant. Importantly, 32% of ERBB2-positive CRCs harbor short variant alterations that are undetectable by routine immunohistochemistry or fluorescence in situ hybridization testing. The success of anti-HER2 therapies in ongoing clinical trials is a promising development for patients with CRC. Cancer 2018;124:1358-73. © 2018 Foundation Medicine, Inc.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase α-Selective Inhibition With Alpelisib (BYL719) in PIK3CA-Altered Solid Tumors: Results From the First-in-Human Study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2018-02-05,"Purpose We report the first-in-human phase Ia study to our knowledge ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01219699) identifying the maximum tolerated dose and assessing safety and preliminary efficacy of single-agent alpelisib (BYL719), an oral phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase α (PI3Kα)-selective inhibitor. Patients and Methods In the dose-escalation phase, patients with PIK3CA-altered advanced solid tumors received once-daily or twice-daily oral alpelisib on a continuous schedule. In the dose-expansion phase, patients with PIK3CA-altered solid tumors and PIK3CA-wild-type, estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer received alpelisib 400 mg once daily. Results One hundred thirty-four patients received treatment. Alpelisib maximum tolerated doses were established as 400 mg once daily and 150 mg twice daily. Nine patients (13.2%) in the dose-escalation phase had dose-limiting toxicities of hyperglycemia (n = 6), nausea (n = 2), and both hyperglycemia and hypophosphatemia (n = 1). Frequent all-grade, treatment-related adverse events included hyperglycemia (51.5%), nausea (50.0%), decreased appetite (41.8%), diarrhea (40.3%), and vomiting (31.3%). Alpelisib was rapidly absorbed; half-life was 7.6 hours at 400 mg once daily with minimal accumulation. Objective tumor responses were observed at doses ≥ 270 mg once daily; overall response rate was 6.0% (n = 8; one patient with endometrial cancer had a complete response, and seven patients with cervical, breast, endometrial, colon, and rectal cancers had partial responses). Stable disease was achieved in 70 (52.2%) patients and was maintained > 24 weeks in 13 (9.7%) patients; disease control rate (complete and partial responses and stable disease) was 58.2%.

"Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Followed by Radical Surgery Versus Concomitant Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy in Patients With Stage IB2, IIA, or IIB Squamous Cervical Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2018-02-12,"Purpose We compared the efficacy and toxicity of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical surgery versus standard cisplatin-based chemoradiation in patients with locally advanced squamous cervical cancer. Patients and Methods This was a single-center, phase III, randomized controlled trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00193739). Eligible patients were between 18 and 65 years old and had stage IB2, IIA, or IIB squamous cervical cancer. They were randomly assigned, after stratification by stage, to receive either three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy using paclitaxel and carboplatin once every 3 weeks followed by radical hysterectomy or standard radiotherapy with concomitant cisplatin once every week for 5 weeks. Patients in the neoadjuvant group received postoperative adjuvant radiation or concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, if indicated. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS), defined as survival without relapse or death related to cancer, and secondary end points included overall survival and toxicity. Results Between September 2003 and February 2015, 635 patients were randomly assigned, of whom 633 (316 patients in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus surgery group and 317 patients in the concomitant chemoradiation group) were included in the final analysis, with a median follow-up time of 58.5 months. The 5-year DFS in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus surgery group was 69.3% compared with 76.7% in the concomitant chemoradiation group (hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.87; P = .038), whereas the corresponding 5-year OS rates were 75.4% and 74.7%, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.025; 95% CI, 0.752 to 1.398; P = .87). The delayed toxicities at 24 months or later after treatment completion in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus surgery group versus the concomitant chemoradiation group were rectal (2.2% v 3.5%, respectively), bladder (1.6% v 3.5%, respectively), and vaginal (12.0% v 25.6%, respectively).

A Curative-Intent Trimodality Approach for Isolated Abdominal Nodal Metastases in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: Update of a Single-Institutional Experience.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2018-02-14,"The purpose of this study was to define survival rates in patients with isolated advanced abdominal nodal metastases secondary to colorectal cancer (CRC), treated with curative-intent trimodality therapy. Sixty-five patients received trimodality therapy, defined as chemotherapy delivered with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) followed by lymphadenectomy and intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT). Infusional 5-fluorouracil was the most common radiosensitizer used (63%, 41 patients). The median dose of EBRT was 50 Gy, and the median dose of IORT was 12.5 Gy. We evaluated time to distant metastasis, toxicities, local failure within the EBRT field, recurrence within the IORT field, and survival. Fifty-two percent of patients were male; patients' median age was 50.5 years. All patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score ≤1. Twenty-nine patients had right-sided colon cancer, 22 had left-sided colon cancer, and 14 had rectal primaries. The median time from initial CRC diagnosis to development of abdominal nodal metastatic disease was 20.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 21.2-40.8 months). Seventy-eight percent (51 patients) had para-aortic nodal metastases, 15% (10 patients) had mesenteric nodal metastases, and 6% (4 patients) had both. With a median follow-up of 77.6 months, the median overall survival and 5-year estimated survival rate were 55.4 months (95% CI, 47.2-80.9 months) and 45%, respectively. The median progression-free survival was 19.3 months (95% CI, 16.5-32.8 months). Twenty-six (40%) patients never developed distant disease. The outcome was not affected by disease sidedness or rectal primary. Treatment was well tolerated without grade 3 or 4 toxicities. Trimodality therapy produces sustainable long-term survival in selected patients with metastatic CRC presenting with isolated retroperitoneal or mesenteric nodal relapse.

Decision-Making Strategy for Rectal Cancer Management Using Radiation Therapy for Elderly or Comorbid Patients.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2018-03-01,"Rectal cancer predominantly affects patients older than 70 years, with peak incidence at age 80 to 85 years. However, the standard treatment paradigm for rectal cancer oftentimes cannot be feasibly applied to these patients owing to frailty or comorbid conditions.

Pathologic response following treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer: Does location matter?,The Journal of surgical research,J. Surg. Res.,2018-01-04,"Despite advances in the treatment of rectal adenocarcinoma, the management of locally advanced disease remains a challenge. The standard of care for patients with stages II and III rectal cancer includes neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by total mesorectal excision and postoperative chemotherapy. Much effort has been dedicated to the identification of predictive factors associated with pathologic complete response (pCR). The aim of our study was to examine our institutional experience and determine whether any association exists between anatomic tumor location and the rate of pCR. We hypothesized that lesions more than 6 cm from the anal verge are more likely to achieve a pCR. Using data from our prospectively maintained tumor registry, a query was completed to identify all patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent treatment at Fox Chase Cancer Center from 2002 to 2015. Demographics, pretreatment, posttreatment, and final pathologic TNM staging data were collected as well as treatment intervals in days, recurrence status, overall survival, and disease-free survival. Patients with incomplete endoscopic data, staging information, survival, or recurrence status were excluded. The primary outcome measured was the degree of pathologic response. Logistic regression was used to adjust for covariates. Of the 135 patients eligible in the study cohort, 39% were female and 61% were male. Regarding initial clinical stage, 43% were stage II and 57% were stage III. A total of 29% had a pCR, 43% had partial pathologic response, and 28% had no response to neoadjuvant treatment. Tumor location ranged from 0 to 13 cm from the anal verge. Longitudinal tumor length was recorded in 111 patients, facilitating the calculation of mean tumor distance from the anal verge. This ranged from 0 to 15.5 cm. Univariate and multivariable analyses were completed using pCR as a primary outcome. No statistically significant difference was noted based on tumor location, regardless of measurement approach.

Adoption of Total Neoadjuvant Therapy for Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer.,JAMA oncology,JAMA Oncol,2018-06-14,"Treatment of locally advanced rectal (LARC) cancer involves chemoradiation, surgery, and chemotherapy. The concept of total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT), in which chemoradiation and chemotherapy are administered prior to surgery, has been developed to optimize delivery of effective systemic therapy aimed at micrometastases. To compare the traditional approach of preoperative chemoradiation (chemoRT) followed by postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with the more recent TNT approach for LARC. A retrospective cohort analysis using Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) records from 2009 to 2015 was carried out. A total of 811 patients who presented with LARC (T3/4 or node-positive) were identified. Of the 811 patients, 320 received chemoRT with planned adjuvant chemotherapy and 308 received TNT (induction fluorouracil- and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy followed by chemoRT). Treatment and outcome data for the 2 cohorts were compared. Dosing and completion of prescribed chemotherapy were assessed on the subset of patients who received all therapy at MSK. Of the 628 patients overall, 373 (59%) were men and 255 (41%) were women, with a mean (SD) age of 56.7 (12.9) years. Of the 308 patients in the TNT cohort, 181 (49%) were men and 127 (49%) were women. Of the 320 patients in the chemoRT with planned adjuvant chemotherapy cohort, 192 (60%) were men and 128 (40%) were women. Patients in the TNT cohort received greater percentages of the planned oxaliplatin and fluorouracil prescribed dose than those in the chemoRT with planned adjuvant chemotherapy cohort. The complete response (CR) rate, including both pathologic CR (pCR) in those who underwent surgery and sustained clinical CR (cCR) for at least 12 months posttreatment in those who did not undergo surgery, was 36% in the TNT cohort compared with 21% in the chemoRT with planned adjuvant chemotherapy cohort. Our findings provide additional support for the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines that categorize TNT as a viable treatment strategy for rectal cancer. Our data suggest that TNT facilitates delivery of planned systemic therapy. Long-term follow-up will determine if this finding translates into improved survival. In addition, given its high CR rate, TNT may facilitate nonoperative treatment strategies aimed at organ preservation.",Comparative Study,586.0,46.0,Treatment of locally advanced LARC cancer involves chemoradiation surgery and chemotherapy The concept of total neoadjuvant therapy TNT in which chemoradiation and chemotherapy are administered prior to surgery has been developed to optimize delivery of effective systemic therapy aimed at micrometastases To compare the traditional approach of preoperative chemoradiation chemoRT followed by postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with the more recent TNT approach for LARC A retrospective cohort analysis using Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center MSK records from 2009 to 2015 was carried out A total of 811 patients who presented with LARC T3/4 or node-positive were identified Of the 811 patients 320 received chemoRT with planned adjuvant chemotherapy and 308 received TNT induction fluorouracil- and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy followed by chemoRT Treatment and outcome data for the 2 cohorts were compared Dosing and completion of prescribed chemotherapy were assessed on the subset of patients who received all therapy at MSK Of the 628 patients overall 373 59 were men and 255 41 were women with a mean SD age of 56.7 12.9 years Of the 308 patients in the TNT cohort 181 49 were men and 127 49 were women Of the 320 patients in the chemoRT with planned adjuvant chemotherapy cohort 192 60 were men and 128 40 were women Patients in the TNT cohort received greater percentages of the planned oxaliplatin and fluorouracil prescribed dose than those in the chemoRT with planned adjuvant chemotherapy cohort The complete response CR rate including both pathologic CR pCR in those who underwent surgery and sustained clinical CR cCR for at least 12 months posttreatment in those who did not undergo surgery was 36 in the TNT cohort compared with 21 in the chemoRT with planned adjuvant chemotherapy cohort Our findings provide additional support for the National Comprehensive Cancer Network NCCN guidelines that categorize TNT as a viable treatment strategy for cancer Our data suggest that TNT facilitates delivery of planned systemic therapy Long-term follow-up will determine if this finding translates into improved survival In addition given its high CR rate TNT may facilitate nonoperative treatment strategies aimed at organ preservation,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[24, 1, 795, 131, 11849, 12, 2921, 975, 152, 2, 56, 3, 2545, 1, 181, 536, 36, 10495, 4, 92, 975, 2, 56, 32, 468, 324, 6, 152, 71, 85, 276, 6, 2465, 989, 1, 323, 403, 36, 1295, 28, 5485, 6, 932, 3, 1847, 353, 1, 498, 975, 13704, 370, 20, 573, 249, 56, 5, 3, 80, 435, 10495, 353, 9, 11849, 8, 459, 180, 65, 75, 2563, 2783, 2784, 12, 574, 7338, 1064, 29, 1238, 6, 1483, 10, 2629, 1205, 8, 181, 1, 16717, 7, 54, 917, 5, 11849, 2065, 39, 15, 289, 109, 11, 108, 1, 3, 16717, 7, 5904, 103, 13704, 5, 1465, 249, 56, 2, 7786, 103, 10495, 504, 1404, 2, 1476, 90, 56, 370, 20, 13704, 24, 2, 228, 74, 9, 3, 18, 736, 11, 72, 1280, 2, 1438, 1, 2746, 56, 11, 275, 23, 3, 697, 1, 7, 54, 103, 62, 36, 28, 7338, 1, 3, 12385, 7, 63, 9342, 728, 11, 325, 2, 7826, 605, 11, 117, 5, 8, 313, 1270, 89, 1, 664, 67, 133, 83, 60, 1, 3, 7786, 7, 4, 3, 10495, 180, 5540, 739, 11, 325, 2, 4080, 739, 11, 117, 1, 3, 5904, 7, 4, 3, 13704, 5, 1465, 249, 56, 180, 5016, 335, 11, 325, 2, 3990, 327, 11, 117, 7, 4, 3, 10495, 180, 103, 378, 5504, 1, 3, 1465, 1476, 2, 1404, 2746, 61, 76, 135, 4, 3, 13704, 5, 1465, 249, 56, 180, 3, 236, 51, 684, 116, 141, 110, 510, 684, 604, 4, 135, 54, 208, 152, 2, 2275, 38, 684, 4992, 9, 28, 506, 133, 53, 3149, 4, 135, 54, 205, 44, 1251, 152, 10, 511, 4, 3, 10495, 180, 72, 5, 239, 4, 3, 13704, 5, 1465, 249, 56, 180, 114, 272, 377, 402, 538, 9, 3, 657, 949, 12, 1801, 1944, 677, 17, 10440, 10495, 22, 8, 2663, 24, 692, 9, 12, 114, 74, 309, 17, 10495, 4936, 989, 1, 1465, 403, 36, 319, 337, 166, 126, 303, 223, 492, 26, 1567, 10328, 237, 231, 25, 4, 352, 447, 211, 64, 684, 116, 10495, 68, 1876, 10803, 24, 422, 1295, 28, 1259, 2224]",2252.0,29566109,232
"Rationale, development, and design of the Altering Intake, Managing Symptoms (AIMS) dietary intervention for bowel dysfunction in rectal cancer survivors.",Contemporary clinical trials,Contemp Clin Trials,2018-03-19,"Bowel dysfunction is a common, persistent long-term effect of treatment for rectal cancer survivors. Survivors often use dietary modifications to maintain bowel control. There are few evidence-based interventions to guide survivors on appropriate diet modifications for bowel symptom management. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development and design of the Altering Intake, Managing Symptoms (AIMS) intervention to support bowel dysfunction management in rectal cancer survivors. The AIMS intervention is a ten-session, telephone-based diet behavior change intervention delivered by trained health coaches. It uses dietary recall, participant-completed food and symptom diaries, and health coaching guided by motivational interviewing to promote bowel symptom management and improved diet quality. Based on the Chronic Care Self-Management Model (CCM), the AIMS Intervention is designed to improve self-efficacy and self-management of bowel symptoms by coaching survivors to appropriately modify their diets through goal setting, self-monitoring, and problem-solving. The intervention targets survivors with stage I-III rectosigmoid colon/rectum cancer who are 6 months post-treatment, 21 years and older, and English-speaking. The design and development process described in this paper provides an overview and underscores the potential of the AIMS intervention to positively impact the quality of long-term survivorship for rectal cancer survivors.

The Differential Expression of Core Genes in Nucleotide Excision Repair Pathway Indicates Colorectal Carcinogenesis and Prognosis.,BioMed research international,Biomed Res Int,2018-01-15,"Nucleotide excision repair (NER) plays a critical role in maintaining genome integrity. This study aimed to investigate the expression of NER genes and their associations with colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Expressions of NER genes in CRC and normal tissues were analysed by ONCOMINE. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data were downloaded to explore relationship of NER expression with clinicopathological parameters and survival of CRC. ERCC1, ERCC2, ERCC5, and DDB2 were upregulated while ERCC4 was downregulated in CRC. For colon cancer, high ERCC3 expression was related to better T stage; ERCC5 expression indicated deeper T stage and distant metastasis; DDB2 expression suggested earlier TNM stage.

All rectal cancer cases presented at a weekly CRC-MDC between July 2015 and June 2016 were prospectively included. Patient demographics and clinical information were recorded. The presenting physician completed a uniform written questionnaire outlining any changes in management as a result of the discussion. There were 408 rectal cancer cases included, and survey responses were obtained for 371 (91%). Thirty-nine patients (11%) had stage IV disease and 20 (5%) had locally recurrent cancer. There was a documented change in plan as a result of the CRC-MDC discussion in 97 of 371 (26%) cases surveyed. Changes in management included a change in therapy or change in therapy sequence in 76 cases, and recommendation of additional evaluation in 36 cases.

A symptom-based model to predict colorectal cancer in low-resource countries: Results from a prospective study of patients at high risk for colorectal cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2018-04-12,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) rates in low-resource countries, which typically lack CRC screening programs, are rising. This study determined whether a risk model for patients with rectal bleeding could identify patients with curable CRC. This prospective, cross-sectional study evaluated a model constructed from data from 1 hospital and validated at 2 other hospitals. The primary endpoint was the ability of the model to predict CRC, as diagnosed by colonoscopy, from clinical characteristics. The secondary endpoint was to determine the percentage of patients who had CRC. Consecutive patients who were 45 years old or older and had self-reported rectal bleeding for more than 1 week were evaluated. From January 2014 to July 2016, 362 patients answered a questionnaire and underwent colonoscopy. In the validation cohort, 56% of patients with rectal bleeding, weight loss, and changes in bowel habits had CRC, whereas 2% of patients with bleeding alone did. Overall, 18.2% of the patients had CRC, and 8.6% had adenomas. The proportion of CRC patients with potentially curable stage II or III disease was 74%, whereas the historical rate was 36%. The combination of rectal bleeding with both symptoms significantly predicted CRC in the validation set (odds ratio, 12.8; 95% confidence interval, 4.6-35.4; P < .001). In low-resource settings, patients with rectal bleeding, weight loss, and changes in bowel habits should be classified as high risk for CRC. Patients with a high risk score should be prioritized for colonoscopy to increase the number of patients diagnosed with potentially curable CRC.

DNA repair protein XPA is differentially expressed in colorectal cancer and predicts better prognosis.,Cancer medicine,Cancer Med,2018-04-19,"As an indispensable factor in DNA damage recognition step of nucleotide excision repair, XPA interacts with a series of proteins to initiate repair process. The expression characteristics of XPA in colorectal cancer (CRC) and its influence on CRC prognosis remain elusive. Tissue specimens of CRC and nontumor adjacent tissues from 283 patients were collected. XPA protein expressions were detected by immunohistochemistry staining. Nonparametric test was used to investigate the difference of XPA expression between CRC and nontumor adjacent tissues, as well as the correlation between XPA expression and clinicopathological parameters of CRC. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were applied to estimate the relationship between XPA expression and CRC prognosis. Meanwhile, we analyzed TCGA data to investigate the relation between XPA mRNA expression and survival of CRC. XPA protein expression was significantly decreased in CRC tissues compared with nontumor adjacent tissues (P = 0.001). Subgroup analysis indicated consistently significant down-regulation of XPA in CRC tissues in age > 60 (P = 0.026), age ≤ 60 (P = 0.008), colon cancer (P = 0.009), and rectal cancer (P = 0.015) patients and males (P = 0.004). For clinicopathological parameters, CRC patients with drinking habits revealed XPA overexpression than nondrinkers (P = 0.032). For prognosis, CRC patients with high XPA protein expression had longer overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.62, 95%CI: 0.39-0.97, P = 0.037). Stratified analysis suggested a better prognosis in relation to high XPA protein expression in patients over 60 years (adjusted HR = 0.48, P = 0.021), with rectal cancer (HR = 0.56, P = 0.037), without distant metastasis (HR = 0.58, P = 0.033), without tumor deposits (HR = 0.40, P = 0.006; adjusted HR = 0.44, P = 0.028), and with tumor diameter over 4 cm (HR = 0.49, P = 0.023).

Diets That Promote Colon Inflammation Associate With Risk of Colorectal Carcinomas That Contain Fusobacterium nucleatum.,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,Clin. Gastroenterol. Hepatol.,2018-04-24,"Specific nutritional components are likely to induce intestinal inflammation, which is characterized by increased levels of interleukin 6 (IL6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and tumor necrosis factor-receptor superfamily member 1B (TNFRSF1B) in the circulation and promotes colorectal carcinogenesis. The inflammatory effects of a diet can be estimated based on an empiric dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP) score, calculated based on intake of 18 foods associated with plasma levels of IL6, CRP, and TNFRSF1B. An inflammatory environment in the colon (based on increased levels of IL6, CRP, and TNFRSF1B in peripheral blood) contributes to impairment of the mucosal barrier and altered immune cell responses, affecting the composition of the intestinal microbiota. Colonization by Fusobacterium nucleatum has been associated with the presence and features of colorectal adenocarcinoma. We investigated the association between diets that promote inflammation (based on EDIP score) and colorectal cancer subtypes classified by level of F nucleatum in the tumor microenvironment. We calculated EDIP scores based on answers to food frequency questionnaires collected from participants in the Nurses' Health Study (through June 1, 2012) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (through January 31, 2012). Participants in both cohorts reported diagnoses of rectal or colon cancer in biennial questionnaires; deaths from unreported colorectal cancer cases were identified through the National Death Index and next of kin. Colorectal tumor tissues were collected from hospitals where the patients underwent tumor resection and F nucleatum DNA was quantified by a polymerase chain reaction assay. We used multivariable duplication-method Cox proportional hazard regression to assess the associations of EDIP scores with risks of colorectal cancer subclassified by F nucleatum status. During 28 years of follow-up evaluation of 124,433 participants, we documented 951 incident cases of colorectal carcinoma with tissue F nucleatum data. Higher EDIP scores were associated with increased risk of F nucleatum-positive colorectal tumors (P<sub>trend</sub> = .03); for subjects in the highest vs lowest EDIP score tertiles, the hazard ratio for F nucleatum-positive colorectal tumors was 1.63 (95% CI, 1.03-2.58). EDIP scores did not associate with F nucleatum-negative tumors (P<sub>trend</sub> = .44). High EDIP scores associated with proximal F nucleatum-positive colorectal tumors but not with proximal F nucleatum-negative colorectal tumors (P<sub>heterogeneity</sub> = .003). Diets that may promote intestinal inflammation, based on EDIP score, are associated with increased risk of F nucleatum-positive colorectal carcinomas, but not carcinomas that do not contain these bacteria.

Radiosensitivity of Lung Metastases by Primary Histology and Implications for Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Using the Genomically Adjusted Radiation Dose.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2018-05-05,"We assessed the radiosensitivity of lung metastases on the basis of primary histologic type by using a validated gene signature and model lung metastases for the gnomically adjusted radiation dose (GARD). Tissue samples were identified from our prospective observational protocol. The radiosensitivity index (RSI) 10-gene assay was run on samples and calculated alongside the GARD by using the previously published algorithms. A cohort of 105 patients with 137 lung metastases treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) at our institution was used for clinical correlation. A total of 138 unique metastatic lung lesions from our institution's tissue biorepository were identified for inclusion. There were significant differences in the RSI of lung metastases on the basis of histology. In order of decreasing radioresistance, the median RSIs for the various histologic types of cancer were endometrial adenocarcinoma (0.49), soft-tissue sarcoma (0.47), melanoma (0.44), rectal adenocarcinoma (0.43), renal cell carcinoma (0.33), head and neck squamous cell cancer (0.33), colon adenocarcinoma (0.32), and breast adenocarcinoma (0.29) (p = 0.002). We modeled the GARD for these samples and identified the biologically effective dose necessary to optimize local control.

Postoperative hypofractionated stereotactic brain radiation (HSRT) for resected brain metastases: improved local control with higher BED<sub>10</sub>.,Journal of neuro-oncology,J. Neurooncol.,2018-05-10,"HSRT directed to large surgical beds in patients with resected brain metastases improves local control while sparing patients the toxicity associated with whole brain radiation. We review our institutional series to determine factors predictive of local failure. In a total of 39 consecutive patients with brain metastases treated from August 2011 to August 2016, 43 surgical beds were treated with HSRT in three or five fractions. All treatments were completed on a robotic radiosurgery platform using the 6D Skull tracking system. Volumetric MRIs from before and after surgery were used for radiation planning. A 2-mm PTV margin was used around the contoured surgical bed and resection margins; these were reviewed by the radiation oncologist and neurosurgeon. Lower total doses were prescribed based on proximity to critical structures or if prior radiation treatments were given. Local control in this study is defined as no volumetric MRI evidence of recurrence of tumor within the high dose radiation volume. Statistics were calculated using JMP Pro v13. Of the 43 surgical beds analyzed, 23 were from NSCLC, 5 were from breast, 4 from melanoma, 5 from esophagus, and 1 each from SCLC, sarcoma, colon, renal, rectal, and unknown primary. Ten were treated with three fractions with median dose 24 Gy and 33 were treated with five fractions with median dose 27.5 Gy using an every other day fractionation. There were no reported grade 3 or higher toxicities. Median follow up was 212 days after completion of radiation. 10 (23%) surgical beds developed local failure with a median time to failure of 148 days. All but three patients developed new brain metastases outside of the treated field and were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery, whole brain radiation and/or chemotherapy. Five patients (13%) developed leptomeningeal disease. With a median follow up of 226 days, 30 Gy/5 fx was associated with the best local control (93%) with only 1 local failure. A lower total dose in five fractions (ie 27.5 or 25 Gy) had a local control rate of 70%. For three fraction SBRT, local control was 100% using a dose of 27 Gy in three fractions (follow up was > 600 days) and 71% if 24 Gy in three fractions was used. A higher total biologically equivalent dose (BED<sub>10</sub>) was statistically significant for improved local control (p = 0.04) with a threshold BED<sub>10</sub> ≥ 48 associated with better local control. HSRT after surgical resection for brain metastasis is well tolerated and has improved local control with BED<sub>10</sub> ≥ 48 (30 Gy/5 fx and 27 Gy/3 fx).

Selective use of radiation for locally advanced rectal cancer: one size does not fit all.,Minerva chirurgica,Minerva Chir,2018-05-25,"The last three decades have seen several major advances in the multidisciplinary management of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC).

In this review we evaluate the evidence for neoadjuvant therapy in LARC and the variety of treatment options available. We identify heterogeneity of outcomes in stage II/III rectal cancer, leading to the potential for overtreatment. The PROSPECT Trial is a multicenter, international effort to determine whether a selective approach to provision of radiotherapy in stage II/III LARC is a viable treatment option.

Association of dietary insulinemic potential and colorectal cancer risk in men and women.,The American journal of clinical nutrition,Am. J. Clin. Nutr.,2018-08-01,"Insulin response may be important in colorectal cancer development. Diet modulates insulin response and may be a modifiable factor in colorectal cancer prevention. We examined associations between hyperinsulinemic diets and colorectal cancer risk with the use of an empirical dietary index for hyperinsulinemia (EDIH), a food-based index that characterizes dietary insulinemic potential on the basis of circulating C-peptide concentrations. Diet was assessed every 4 y with food-frequency questionnaires in 46,210 men (Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, 1986-2012) and 74,191 women (Nurses' Health Study, 1984-2012) to calculate EDIH scores. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression was used to calculate HRs and 95% CIs for colorectal, proximal/distal colon, and rectal cancer risk. During 26 y of follow-up, we documented 2683 incident colorectal cancer cases. Comparing participants in the highest with those in the lowest quintiles, higher EDIH scores were associated with 33% (men: HR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.61; P-trend = 0.0005), 22% (women: HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.45; P-trend = 0.01), and 26% (men and women: pooled HR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.42; P-trend <0.0001) higher risk of developing colorectal cancer. The positive associations were limited to the distal colon and rectum in men and to the distal and proximal colon in women; however, combined risk estimates were significant for all anatomic locations except for the rectum. For example, comparing participants in extreme EDIH quintiles, there was no significant association for proximal colon cancer in men (HR: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.84, 1.57; P-trend = 0.32), but the risk was elevated for distal colon (HR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.14, 2.32; P-trend = 0.002) and rectal (HR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.44; P-trend = 0.01) cancer.

"Clinical significance and prognostic relevance of KRAS, BRAF, PI3K and TP53 genetic mutation analysis for resectable and unresectable colorectal liver metastases: A systematic review of the current evidence.",Surgical oncology,Surg Oncol,2018-05-08,"Hepatic resection is considered the optimal potentially curative treatment for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). Following resection, up to two-thirds of patients will develop recurrence within 5-years. Genetic mutation analysis of CRLM, especially KRAS status, has been proposed as a means to guide treatment, as well as identifying patients who can derive the most survival benefit from hepatic resection. A systematic review of the literature was conducted the PubMed, Embase and Cochrane library through February 8th, 2018. The following algorithm was applied: ""(colorectal OR rectal OR colon OR colonic) AND (liver OR hepatic) AND (metastasis OR metastases) AND (gene OR mutation OR KRAS OR BRAF OR SMAD4 OR RAS OR TP53 OR P53 OR APC OR PI3K OR MSI OR EGFR OR MACC1 OR microsatellite)."" From the 2404 records retrieved, 78 studies were finally deemed eligible; 47 studies reported mutational data on patients with resectable CRLM, whereas 31 studies reported on patients with unresectable CRLM. Mutational analyses were mostly performed on the CRLM specimen rather than the primary CRC. The vast majority of studies reported on the KRAS mutational status (88.5%, n = 69/78). Prevalence of KRAS mutations ranged from 25% to 52%. Most studies reported that RAS mutation was a negative prognostic factor for overall (OS) (n = 24) and recurrence-free (RFS) (n = 9) survival; a few reports noted no effect of RAS mutational status on OS (n = 4) or RFS (n = 6). Twelve studies reported on BRAF mutations with a prevalence of BRAF mutation ranging from 0 to 9.1% in resected CRLM specimens. BRAF mutation was strongly associated with a worse prognosis. TP53 and PIK3CA gene mutations did not affect long-term outcomes. The biological status of each tumor provides the basis for individualized cancer therapeutics.

Surg.,2018-06-26,"Rising healthcare costs have led to increased focus on the need to achieve a higher ""value of care."" As value-maximization efforts expand to include more complex surgical patients, evidence to support meaningful implementation of complication-based initiatives is lacking. The objective of this study was to compare incremental costs of complications following major gastrointestinal (GI) resections for organ-specific malignant neoplasia using nationally representative data. National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample data, 2001-2014, were queried for adult (≥ 18 years) patients undergoing major resections for malignant neoplasia. Based on system-based complications considered relevant to the long-term treatment of GI disease, stratified differences in risk-adjusted incremental hospital costs and complication probabilities were compared. Differences in surgical outcomes and costs over time were also assessed. A total of 293,967 patients were included, weighted to represent 1,408,117 patients nationwide. One fourth (26.1%; 95% CI, 25.7-26.4%) experienced ≥ 1 pre-discharge complication (range, 45.3% esophagectomy to 24.0% rectal resection). Resultant annual risk-adjusted incremental hospital costs totaled $540 million nationwide (19.5% of the overall cost of care and an average of $20,900 per patient). Costs varied substantially with both cancer/resection type and complication group, ranging from $76.7 million for colectomies with infectious complications to $0.2 million for rectal resections with urinary complications. For each resection type, infectious ($154.7 million), GI ($85.5 million), and pulmonary ($77.9 million) complications were among the most significant drivers of increased hospital cost.

Colon and Rectal Neuroendocrine Tumors: Are They Really One Disease? A Single-Institution Experience over 15 Years.,The American surgeon,Am Surg,2018-05-01,"Colon and rectal neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are often studied as one entity. Recent evidence suggests that worse outcomes are associated with colon compared with rectal NETs; direct comparisons are lacking. Our aim was to assess clinicopathologic, treatment, and survival differences between these diseases. All patients who underwent resection of colorectal NETs at one institution from 2000 to 2014 were included and analyzed. Of 29 patients, 12(41%) had colon and 17 (59%) had rectal NETs. Baseline demographics were similar between groups, although colon patients tended to be symptomatic at presentation (67% vs 44%, P = 0.41). Eighty-three per cent of colon patients underwent surgical resection, whereas 77 per cent of rectal patients underwent endoscopic or transanal resection (P = 0.003). Colon patients had larger (3.4 cm vs 0.7 cm, P = 0.03), higher T-stage (T3/T4: 91% vs 14%, P = 0.003), higher grade tumors (42% vs 12%, P = 0.09) with more lymph nodes (58% vs 24%, P = 0.12) and lymphovascular invasion positivity (58% vs 24%, P = 0.32). Five-year disease-specific survival was 53% versus 80 per cent for colon and rectal patients, respectively (P = 0.22). After excluding high-grade tumors, colon NETs were associated with lymphovascular invasion positivity (100% vs 17%, P = 0.05) and advanced T-stage (80% vs 8%, P = 0.01).

Resection of a Perirectal Leiomyosarcoma via a Posterior Transcoccygeal Approach.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2018-07-06,"The management of perirectal tumors often requires rectal wall resection, and sometimes a complete proctectomy is required. Access to posterior perirectal masses via a posterior, transcoccygeal approach (Kraske procedure) avoids dissection of the intraperitoneal rectum. The patient was a 63-year-old male who presented to his primary care physician with debilitating perirectal pain of several months' duration. He did not respond to therapy with pain medications and topical agents, and underwent a lateral internal sphincterotomy for what was thought to be an anal fissure, without relief prior to referral. Diagnostic workup showed a low signal intensity mass on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and biopsy revealed high-grade leiomyosarcoma with myxoid features. Staging workup included a contrast-enhanced computed tomography chest, abdomen and pelvis, flexible sigmoidoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound. A lytic lesion in his left ilium on MRI was found to be avid on fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scan and was therefore consistent with oligometastatic disease. He received six cycles of adriamycin, cyclophosphamide and dacarbazine, with good response. The metastatic lesion was treated with 24 Gy of radiotherapy, while the primary tumor was treated with 50 Gy of radiotherapy. The patient underwent the Kraske approach with radical resection of the perirectal mass. The rectal wall was closed with interrupted silk sutures, and layered closure of incision over a drain was performed. An R0 resection was achieved. A laparoscopic diverting loop ileostomy to protect the rectal repair was performed. The Kraske approach allows for adequate resection, while avoiding the morbidity of the transabdominal approach, and allowing the patient to maintain a continent rectum.",Case Reports,564.0,0.0,The management of perirectal tumors often requires wall resection and sometimes a complete proctectomy is required Access to posterior perirectal masses via a posterior transcoccygeal approach Kraske procedure avoids dissection of the intraperitoneal rectum The patient was a 63-year-old male who presented to his primary care physician with debilitating perirectal pain of several months duration He did not respond to therapy with pain medications and topical agents and underwent a lateral internal sphincterotomy for what was thought to be an fissure without relief prior to referral Diagnostic workup showed a low signal intensity mass on magnetic resonance imaging MRI and biopsy revealed high-grade leiomyosarcoma with myxoid features Staging workup included a contrast-enhanced computed tomography chest abdomen and pelvis flexible sigmoidoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound A lytic lesion in his left ilium on MRI was found to be avid on fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scan and was therefore consistent with oligometastatic disease He received six cycles of adriamycin cyclophosphamide and dacarbazine with good response The metastatic lesion was treated with 24 Gy of radiotherapy while the primary tumor was treated with 50 Gy of radiotherapy The patient underwent the Kraske approach with radical resection of the perirectal mass The wall was closed with interrupted silk sutures and layered closure of incision over a drain was performed An R0 resection was achieved A laparoscopic diverting loop ileostomy to protect the repair was performed The Kraske approach allows for adequate resection while avoiding the morbidity of the transabdominal approach and allowing the patient to maintain a continent rectum,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[3, 284, 1, 12796, 57, 629, 1706, 2397, 170, 2, 5164, 8, 236, 12899, 16, 616, 1655, 6, 3028, 12796, 2692, 847, 8, 3028, 73190, 353, 30685, 1299, 14139, 1161, 1, 3, 3339, 3660, 3, 69, 10, 8, 676, 111, 1095, 1045, 54, 917, 6, 3224, 86, 165, 1473, 5, 8099, 12796, 559, 1, 392, 53, 654, 3174, 205, 44, 1892, 6, 36, 5, 559, 2679, 2, 5879, 183, 2, 208, 8, 3855, 2329, 39510, 9, 2067, 10, 2739, 6, 40, 35, 39461, 187, 4586, 324, 6, 2096, 752, 4755, 224, 8, 154, 1235, 837, 782, 23, 1484, 1535, 270, 704, 2, 411, 553, 64, 88, 3717, 5, 5707, 404, 632, 4755, 159, 8, 748, 651, 1220, 872, 1662, 4036, 2, 3270, 6940, 11607, 2, 2056, 1945, 8, 6148, 1180, 4, 3224, 1712, 18295, 23, 704, 10, 204, 6, 40, 5189, 23, 4085, 1900, 1799, 872, 1657, 2, 10, 673, 925, 5, 4101, 34, 3174, 103, 437, 410, 1, 7700, 1112, 2, 3404, 5, 1178, 51, 3, 113, 1180, 10, 73, 5, 259, 381, 1, 310, 369, 3, 86, 30, 10, 73, 5, 212, 381, 1, 310, 3, 69, 208, 3, 30685, 353, 5, 711, 170, 1, 3, 12796, 782, 3, 2397, 10, 3745, 5, 12981, 26598, 31720, 2, 32505, 4830, 1, 7538, 252, 8, 9203, 10, 173, 35, 2328, 170, 10, 513, 8, 1964, 15107, 4432, 12879, 6, 4869, 3, 972, 10, 173, 3, 30685, 353, 2333, 9, 1658, 170, 369, 6048, 3, 787, 1, 3, 16333, 353, 2, 2952, 3, 69, 6, 3040, 8, 10396, 3660]",1735.0,29981026,31
Rectal cancer patients younger than 50 years lack a survival benefit from NCCN guideline-directed treatment for stage II and III disease.,Cancer,Cancer,2018-07-09,"The incidence of rectal cancer in patients younger than 50 years is increasing. To test the hypothesis that the biology in this younger cohort may differ, this study compared survival patterns, stratifying patients according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline-driven care and age. The National Cancer Data Base was queried for patients treated with curative-intent transabdominal resections with negative surgical margins for stage I to III rectal cancer between 2004 and 2014. Outcomes and overall survival for patients younger than 50 years and patients 50 years old or older were compared by subgroups based on NCCN guideline-driven care. A total of 43,106 patients were analyzed. Younger patients were more likely to be female and minorities, to be diagnosed at a higher stage, and to have travelled further to be treated at academic/integrated centers. Short- and long-term outcomes were significantly better for patients younger than 50 years, with age-specific survival rates calculated. Younger patients were more likely to receive radiation treatment outside NCCN guidelines for stage I disease. In younger patients, the administration of neoadjuvant chemoradiation for stage II and III disease was not associated with an overall survival benefit. Age-specific survival data for patients with rectal cancer treated with curative intent do not support an overall survival benefit from NCCN guideline-driven therapy for stage II and III patients younger than 50 years.

Psoriasis and cancer. An Australian/New Zealand narrative.,The Australasian journal of dermatology,Australas. J. Dermatol.,2018-07-10,"Patients with psoriasis have an increased risk of cancer, which may be due to impaired immune surveillance, immune modulatory treatments, chronic inflammation and/or co-risk factors such as obesity. The increase in treatment-independent solid cancers, including urinary/bladder cancers, oropharynx/larynx, liver/gallbladder and colon/rectal cancers, seem to be linked to alcohol and smoking. Lung cancer and nonmelanoma skin cancer are also increased in patients with psoriasis. The risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer increases with age and severity of psoriasis. It is also higher in men, particularly for squamous cell carcinoma, which may reflect previous exposure to PUVA and/or ciclosporin. The risk of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is substantially higher in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Biologic therapies are independently associated with a slight increase risk of cancer, but this is less than ciclosporin, with the risk confounded by disease severity and other co-risk factors. The risk of cancer from low-dose methotrexate is likely minimal. In contrast, acitretin is likely protective against a variety of solid and haematological malignancies. The data on small molecule therapies such as apremilast are too immature for comment, although no signal has yet been identified. The decision whether to stop psoriasis immune modulatory treatments following a diagnosis of cancer, and when to resume, needs to be considered in the context of the patients' specific cancer.

The rectum and mesorectum were resected using open instruments for rectal dissection (included hybrid hand-assisted laparoscopic) or with laparoscopic instruments under pneumoperitoneum. The 2-year DFS and recurrence were secondary endpoints of Z6051. The DFS and recurrence were not powered, and are being assessed for superiority. Recurrence was determined at 3, 6, 9, 12, and every 6 months thereafter, using carcinoembryonic antigen, physical examination, computed tomography, and colonoscopy.

Standard Chemoradiation and Conventional Brachytherapy for Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer: Is It Still Applicable in the Era of Magnetic Resonance-Based Brachytherapy?,Journal of global oncology,J Glob Oncol,2018-07-01,"Purpose Recent guidelines recommend magnetic resonance imaging-based brachytherapy (MRBT) for locally advanced cervical cancer. However, its implementation is challenging within the developing world. This article reports the outcomes of patients with locally advanced cervical cancer treated with chemoradiation and point A-based brachytherapy (BT) using x-ray- or computed tomography-based planning. Methods Patients treated between January 2014 and December 2015 were included. Patients underwent x-ray- or computed tomography-based BT planning with an aim to deliver equivalent doses in 2 Gy (EQD2) > 84 Gy<sub>10</sub> to point A while minimizing maximum dose received by rectum or bladder to a point or 2 cc volume to < 75 Gy EQD2 and < 90 Gy EQD2, respectively<sub>.</sub> The impact of known prognostic factors was evaluated. Results A total of 339 patients were evaluated. Median age was 52 (32 to 81) years; 52% of patients had stage IB2 to IIB and 48% had stage III to IVA disease. There was 85% compliance with chemoradiation, and 87% of patients received four or more cycles. Median point A dose was 84 (64.8 to 89.7) Gy. The median rectal and bladder doses were 73.5 (69.6 to 78.4) Gy<sub>3</sub> and 83 (73.2 to 90.0) Gy<sub>3</sub>, respectively. At a median follow-up of 28 (4 to 45) months, the 3-year local, disease-free, and overall survival for stage IB to IIB disease was 94.1%, 83.3%, and 82.7%, respectively.

"Randomized Trial of Hypofractionated, Dose-Escalated, Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) Versus Conventionally Fractionated IMRT for Localized Prostate Cancer.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2018-08-14,"Hypofractionated radiotherapy delivers larger daily doses of radiation and may increase the biologically effective dose delivered to the prostate. We conducted a randomized trial testing the hypothesis that dose-escalated, moderately hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiation therapy (HIMRT) improves prostate cancer control compared with conventionally fractionated IMRT (CIMRT) for men with localized prostate cancer. Men were randomly assigned to 75.6 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions delivered over 8.4 weeks (CIMRT) or 72 Gy in 2.4 Gy fractions delivered over 6 weeks (HIMRT, biologically equivalent to 85 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions assuming prostate cancer α-to-β ratio of 1.5). Failure was defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure (nadir plus 2 ng/mL) or initiation of salvage therapy. Modified Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria were used to grade late (≥ 90 days after completion of radiotherapy) GI and genitourinary toxicity. Most of the 206 men (72%) had cT1, Gleason score 6 or 7 (99%), and PSA level ≤ 10 ng/mL (90%) disease. Androgen deprivation therapy was received by 24%. With a median follow-up of 8.5 years, men treated with HIMRT experienced fewer treatment failures (n = 10) than men treated with CIMRT (n = 21; P = .036). The 8-year failure rate was 10.7% (95% CI, 5.8% to 19.1%) with HIMRT and 15.4% (95% CI, 9.1% to 25.4%) with CIMRT. There was no difference in overall survival ( P = .39). There was a nonsignificant increase in late grade 2 or 3 GI toxicity with HIMRT (8-year 5.0% v 12.6%; P = .08). However, GI toxicity was only 8.6% when rectal volume receiving 65 Gy of HIMRT was ≤ 15%. Late genitourinary toxicity was similar ( P = .84). There was no grade 4 toxicity. The results of this randomized trial demonstrate superior cancer control for men with localized prostate cancer who receive dose-escalated moderately hypofractionation radiotherapy while shortening treatment duration.","Clinical Trial, Phase III",525.0,12.0,Hypofractionated radiotherapy delivers larger daily doses of radiation and may increase the biologically effective dose delivered to the We conducted a randomized trial testing the hypothesis that dose-escalated moderately hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiation therapy HIMRT improves cancer control compared with conventionally fractionated IMRT CIMRT for men with localized cancer Men were randomly assigned to 75.6 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions delivered over 8.4 weeks CIMRT or 72 Gy in 2.4 Gy fractions delivered over 6 weeks HIMRT biologically equivalent to 85 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions assuming cancer α-to-β ratio of 1.5 Failure was defined as prostate-specific antigen PSA failure nadir plus 2 ng/mL or initiation of salvage therapy Modified Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria were used to grade late ≥ 90 days after completion of radiotherapy GI and genitourinary toxicity Most of the 206 men 72 had cT1 Gleason score 6 or 7 99 and PSA level ≤ 10 ng/mL 90 disease Androgen deprivation therapy was received by 24 With a median follow-up of 8.5 years men treated with HIMRT experienced fewer treatment failures n 10 than men treated with CIMRT n 21 P .036 The 8-year failure rate was 10.7 95 CI 5.8 to 19.1 with HIMRT and 15.4 95 CI 9.1 to 25.4 with CIMRT There was no difference in overall survival P .39 There was a nonsignificant increase in late grade 2 or 3 GI toxicity with HIMRT 8-year 5.0 v 12.6 P .08 However GI toxicity was only 8.6 when volume receiving 65 Gy of HIMRT was ≤ 15 Late genitourinary toxicity was similar P .84 There was no grade 4 toxicity The results of this randomized trial demonstrate superior cancer control for men with localized cancer who receive dose-escalated moderately hypofractionation radiotherapy while shortening treatment duration,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[4479, 310, 11251, 1077, 391, 415, 1, 121, 2, 68, 344, 3, 2665, 323, 61, 1623, 6, 3, 21, 426, 8, 384, 160, 471, 3, 1492, 17, 61, 2842, 3508, 4479, 837, 1757, 121, 36, 13190, 1804, 12, 182, 72, 5, 6846, 3950, 964, 17543, 9, 325, 5, 909, 12, 325, 11, 1108, 896, 6, 481, 49, 381, 4, 14, 66, 381, 1550, 1623, 252, 66, 39, 244, 17543, 15, 720, 381, 4, 18, 39, 381, 1550, 1623, 252, 49, 244, 13190, 2665, 2017, 6, 772, 381, 4, 14, 66, 381, 1550, 7242, 12, 2014, 6, 1458, 197, 1, 14, 33, 496, 10, 395, 22, 1364, 112, 448, 534, 496, 3686, 349, 18, 997, 542, 15, 1118, 1, 992, 36, 1230, 121, 36, 413, 87, 371, 11, 95, 6, 88, 807, 749, 424, 162, 50, 1438, 1, 310, 2104, 2, 4109, 155, 96, 1, 3, 5956, 325, 720, 42, 7669, 1406, 368, 49, 15, 67, 1058, 2, 534, 301, 1552, 79, 997, 542, 424, 34, 687, 1868, 36, 10, 103, 20, 259, 5, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 66, 33, 60, 325, 73, 5, 13190, 592, 1497, 24, 3368, 78, 79, 76, 325, 73, 5, 17543, 78, 239, 19, 5395, 3, 66, 111, 496, 116, 10, 79, 67, 48, 58, 33, 66, 6, 326, 14, 5, 13190, 2, 167, 39, 48, 58, 83, 14, 6, 243, 39, 5, 17543, 125, 10, 77, 523, 4, 63, 25, 19, 587, 125, 10, 8, 5542, 344, 4, 807, 88, 18, 15, 27, 2104, 155, 5, 13190, 66, 111, 33, 13, 603, 133, 49, 19, 1592, 137, 2104, 155, 10, 158, 66, 49, 198, 433, 357, 556, 381, 1, 13190, 10, 1552, 167, 807, 4109, 155, 10, 288, 19, 874, 125, 10, 77, 88, 39, 155, 3, 99, 1, 26, 384, 160, 608, 1123, 12, 182, 9, 325, 5, 909, 12, 54, 560, 61, 2842, 3508, 7614, 310, 369, 9245, 24, 654]",1785.0,30106637,116
Targeting <i>BRAF</i> Mutations in High-Grade Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Colon.,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,2018-09-01,"Mutations in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway leading to constitutive activation and uncontrolled cellular growth have been identified in various human malignancies, making this pathway a target for potential therapeutics. The activating <i>BRAF</i><sup>V600E</sup> mutation is one well-characterized oncogenic mutation that has been described and targeted with clinical success in various malignancies, including melanoma and hairy cell leukemia. Although <i>BRAF</i>-directed treatments have yielded clinical benefit in a subset of tumor types, such as melanoma, thyroid cancer, and lung cancer, BRAF inhibition fails to confer a clinical benefit in colon cancer. Identification of patients for whom BRAF inhibition may produce clinically meaningful outcomes is imperative. The incidence of <i>BRAF</i> mutations in neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is estimated to be 5% to 10%. A recent case series demonstrated benefit in targeting the <i>BRAF</i><sup>V600E</sup> mutation in metastatic high-grade rectal NECs. Combination BRAF and MEK inhibition is known to yield improved outcomes compared with BRAF inhibition alone in melanoma. This report presents 2 patients with high-grade colorectal NECs who had different responses to treatment with combined BRAF/MEK inhibition after experiencing disease progression through first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. One patient experienced an excellent initial response to therapy before ultimately experiencing progression, and in the other patient initially had stable disease before eventually experiencing progression.

Controversies in Surgical Oncology: Does the Minimally Invasive Approach for Rectal Cancer Provide Equivalent Oncologic Outcomes Compared with the Open Approach?,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2018-09-05,"Compared with open surgery, minimally invasive surgery for colon cancer has been shown to improve short-term outcomes and yield equivalent long-term oncologic results. It remains to be seen if oncologic outcomes for the minimally invasive approach for rectal cancer are equivalent to traditional open rectal resection. We conducted a systematic review of Medline, SCOPUS, and Cochrane databases. Relevant studies were selected using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Five key questions comparing minimally invasive and open oncologic outcomes for rectal cancer were specifically analyzed. A meta-analysis was not done due to heterogeneity of studies. Forty-five studies met inclusion criteria, including six randomized controlled trials. The laparoscopic approach to rectal resection was not more likely than the traditional open approach to have clear circumferential and distal margins, a complete total mesorectal excision grade, ≥ 12 lymph nodes in the resected specimen, reduced local recurrence rates, or reduced overall survival rates. Two randomized trials revealed that successful laparoscopic resection was not noninferior to open. Caution should be exercised when choosing surgical options for rectal cancer.

Consolidation mFOLFOX6 Chemotherapy After Chemoradiotherapy Improves Survival in Patients With Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer: Final Results of a Multicenter Phase II Trial.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2018-10-01,"Adding modified FOLFOX6 (folinic acid, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin) after chemoradiotherapy and lengthening the chemoradiotherapy-to-surgery interval is associated with an increase in the proportion of rectal cancer patients with a pathological complete response. The purpose of this study was to analyze disease-free and overall survival. This was a nonrandomized phase II trial. The study was conducted at multiple institutions. Four sequential study groups with stage II or III rectal cancer were included. All of the patients received 50 Gy of radiation with concurrent continuous infusion of fluorouracil for 5 weeks. Patients in each group received 0, 2, 4, or 6 cycles of modified FOLFOX6 after chemoradiation and before total mesorectal excision. Patients were recommended to receive adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery to complete a total of 8 cycles of modified FOLFOX6. The trial was powered to detect differences in pathological complete response, which was reported previously. Disease-free and overall survival are the main outcomes for the current study. Of 259 patients, 211 had a complete follow-up. Median follow-up was 59 months (range, 9-125 mo). The mean number of total chemotherapy cycles differed among the 4 groups (p = 0.002), because one third of patients in the group assigned to no preoperative FOLFOX did not receive any adjuvant chemotherapy. Disease-free survival was significantly associated with study group, ypTNM stage, and pathological complete response (p = 0.004, <0.001, and 0.001). A secondary analysis including only patients who received ≥1 cycle of FOLFOX still showed differences in survival between study groups (p = 0.03). The trial was not randomized and was not powered to show differences in survival. Survival data were not available for 19% of the patients. Adding modified FOLFOX6 after chemoradiotherapy and before total mesorectal excision increases compliance with systemic chemotherapy and disease-free survival in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Neoadjuvant consolidation chemotherapy may have benefits beyond increasing pathological complete response rates.

Following microscopicallly complete resection of primary tumor and involved lymph nodes in all patients, ≤6 courses of chemotherapy were given. Five-year rates of local control (LC), metastases-free survival (MFS) and overall survival (OS) were 90%, 79% and 77%.

Vitamin D status after colorectal cancer diagnosis and patient survival according to immune response to tumour.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",Eur. J. Cancer,2018-09-13,"High-level plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] has been associated with lower colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. Considering evidence indicating immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D, we hypothesised that survival benefits from high systemic vitamin D level might be stronger for colorectal carcinoma with lower immune response to tumour. Using 869 colon and rectal cancer cases within the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, we assessed the prognostic association of postdiagnosis 25(OH)D score [derived from diet and lifestyle variables to predict plasma 25(OH)D level] in strata of levels of histopathologic lymphocytic reaction. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was adjusted for potential confounders, including microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, LINE-1 methylation, PTGS2 (cyclooxygenase-2) expression and KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations. The association of postdiagnosis 25(OH)D score with colorectal cancer-specific mortality differed by levels of peritumoural lymphocytic reaction (p<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.001). Multivariable-adjusted mortality hazard ratios for a quintile-unit increase of 25(OH)D score were 0.69 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.54-0.89] in cases with negative/low peritumoural lymphocytic reaction, 1.08 (95% CI, 0.93-1.26) in cases with intermediate peritumoural reaction and 1.25 (95% CI, 0.75-2.09) in cases with high peritumoural reaction. The survival association of the 25(OH)D score did not significantly differ by Crohn's-like lymphoid reaction, intratumoural periglandular reaction or tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes.

Considering differences in the tumor-immune microenvironment between MSI-high and non-MSI-high carcinomas, we hypothesized that the association of <i>F. nucleatum</i> with immune response might differ by tumor MSI status. Using samples from 1,041 rectal and colon cancer patients within the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, we measured <i>F. nucleatum</i> DNA in tumor tissue by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the association between <i>F. nucleatum</i> status and histopathologic lymphocytic reactions or density of CD3<sup>+</sup> cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> cells, CD45RO (PTPRC)<sup>+</sup> cells, or FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells in strata of tumor MSI status. We adjusted for potential confounders, including CpG island methylator phenotype; LINE-1 methylation; and <i>KRAS, BRAF</i>, and <i>PIK3CA</i> mutations. The association of <i>F. nucleatum</i> with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and intratumoral periglandular reaction differed by tumor MSI status (<i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub> = 0.002). The presence of <i>F. nucleatum</i> was negatively associated with TIL in MSI-high tumors [multivariable odds ratio (OR), 0.45; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.22-0.92], but positively associated with TIL in non-MSI-high tumors (multivariable OR 1.91; 95% CI, 1.12-3.25). No significant differential association was observed for peritumoral lymphocytic reaction, Crohn-like lymphoid reaction, or T-cell densities. In conclusion, the association of <i>F. nucleatum</i> with immune response to colorectal carcinoma differs by tumor MSI status, suggesting that <i>F. nucleatum</i> and MSI status interact to affect antitumor immune reactions. <i>Cancer Immunol Res; 6(11); 1327-36. ©2018 AACR</i><i>See related Spotlight on p. 1290</i>.",Journal Article,490.0,15.0,"The presence of i Fusobacterium nucleatum /i i F nucleatum /i in carcinoma tissue has been associated with microsatellite instability MSI lower-level T-cell infiltrates and poor clinical outcomes Considering differences in the tumor-immune microenvironment between MSI-high and non-MSI-high carcinomas we hypothesized that the association of i F nucleatum /i with immune response might differ by tumor MSI status Using samples from 1,041 and cancer patients within the Nurses Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study we measured i F nucleatum /i DNA in tumor tissue by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the association between i F nucleatum /i status and histopathologic lymphocytic reactions or density of CD3 sup /sup cells CD8 sup /sup cells CD45RO PTPRC sup /sup cells or FOXP3 sup /sup cells in strata of tumor MSI status We adjusted for potential confounders including CpG island methylator phenotype LINE-1 methylation and i KRAS BRAF /i and i PIK3CA /i mutations The association of i F nucleatum /i with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes TIL and intratumoral periglandular reaction differed by tumor MSI status i P /i sub interaction /sub 0.002 The presence of i F nucleatum /i was negatively associated with TIL in MSI-high tumors multivariable odds ratio OR 0.45 95 confidence interval CI 0.22-0.92 but positively associated with TIL in non-MSI-high tumors multivariable OR 1.91 95 CI 1.12-3.25 No significant differential association was observed for peritumoral lymphocytic reaction Crohn-like lymphoid reaction or T-cell densities In conclusion the association of i F nucleatum /i with immune response to carcinoma differs by tumor MSI status suggesting that i F nucleatum /i and MSI status interact to affect antitumor immune reactions i Cancer Immunol Res 6 11 1327-36 ©2018 AACR /i i See related Spotlight on p. 1290 /i",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[3, 463, 1, 70, 11369, 7232, 70, 70, 1068, 7232, 70, 4, 134, 246, 71, 85, 41, 5, 2226, 1753, 1494, 280, 301, 102, 31, 5942, 2, 334, 38, 123, 3075, 362, 4, 3, 30, 250, 995, 59, 1494, 64, 2, 220, 1494, 64, 826, 21, 1237, 17, 3, 248, 1, 70, 1068, 7232, 70, 5, 250, 51, 822, 1505, 20, 30, 1494, 156, 75, 347, 29, 14, 5937, 2, 12, 7, 262, 3, 2707, 341, 45, 2, 341, 3409, 166, 126, 45, 21, 644, 70, 1068, 7232, 70, 261, 4, 30, 246, 20, 8, 1156, 1451, 1260, 1329, 719, 658, 812, 320, 274, 11, 95, 6, 1004, 3, 248, 59, 70, 1068, 7232, 70, 156, 2, 2630, 1193, 2428, 15, 1263, 1, 3117, 172, 172, 37, 968, 172, 172, 37, 11469, 21632, 172, 172, 37, 15, 3548, 172, 172, 37, 4, 5758, 1, 30, 1494, 156, 21, 586, 9, 174, 4423, 141, 2075, 3454, 5440, 1005, 328, 14, 569, 2, 70, 723, 566, 70, 2, 70, 1506, 70, 138, 3, 248, 1, 70, 1068, 7232, 70, 5, 30, 2097, 1594, 3387, 2, 2074, 21582, 1329, 2512, 20, 30, 1494, 156, 70, 19, 70, 551, 915, 551, 13, 1111, 3, 463, 1, 70, 1068, 7232, 70, 10, 2723, 41, 5, 3387, 4, 1494, 64, 57, 658, 610, 197, 15, 13, 512, 48, 307, 268, 58, 13, 350, 13, 937, 84, 2375, 41, 5, 3387, 4, 220, 1494, 64, 57, 658, 15, 14, 970, 48, 58, 14, 133, 27, 243, 77, 93, 1777, 248, 10, 164, 9, 5432, 1193, 1329, 11612, 733, 2303, 1329, 15, 102, 31, 6908, 4, 1221, 3, 248, 1, 70, 1068, 7232, 70, 5, 250, 51, 6, 134, 4990, 20, 30, 1494, 156, 802, 17, 70, 1068, 7232, 70, 2, 1494, 156, 4491, 6, 1158, 579, 250, 2428, 70, 12, 8557, 1936, 49, 175, 34555, 511, 4281, 1630, 70, 70, 3764, 139, 25558, 23, 19, 24957, 70]",1920.0,30228205,8
The Amount of Bifidobacterium Genus in Colorectal Carcinoma Tissue in Relation to Tumor Characteristics and Clinical Outcome.,The American journal of pathology,Am. J. Pathol.,2018-09-20,"Evidence indicates a complex link between microbiota, tumor characteristics, and host immunity in the tumor microenvironment. In experimental studies, bifidobacteria appear to modulate intestinal epithelial cell differentiation. Accumulating evidence suggests that bifidobacteria may enhance the antitumor immunity and efficacy of immunotherapy. We hypothesized that the amount of bifidobacteria in colorectal carcinoma tissue might be associated with tumor differentiation and higher immune response to colorectal cancer. Using a molecular pathologic epidemiology database of 1313 rectal and colon cancers, we measured the amount of Bifidobacterium DNA in carcinoma tissue by a quantitative PCR assay. The multivariable regression model was used to adjust for potential confounders, including microsatellite instability status, CpG island methylator phenotype, long-interspersed nucleotide element-1 methylation, and KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations. Intratumor bifidobacteria were detected in 393 cases (30%). The amount of bifidobacteria was associated with the extent of signet ring cells (P = 0.002). Compared with Bifidobacterium-negative cases, multivariable odd ratios for the extent of signet ring cells were 1.29 (95% CI, 0.74-2.24) for Bifidobacterium-low cases and 1.87 (95% CI, 1.16-3.02) for Bifidobacterium-high cases (P<sub>trend</sub> = 0.01).

J. Cancer,2018-09-27,"Patients with left-sided colon tumours have better survival and respond differently to biologics compared with patients with right-sided tumours. Left-sided colon tumours and rectal cancers are often grouped together. Herein, we examined the clinicopathological differences and outcomes between left-sided colon and rectal cancers. Data from 2879 metastatic colorectal cancer patients enrolled on six first-line clinical trials during 2004-2010 were pooled. Patients were included if the primary tumour origin was clearly defined. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared in the two groups after adjusting for patient and tumour characteristics, metastatic sites and the first-line regimen. In total, 1374 patients with metastatic left-sided colon cancer and 1505 patients with metastatic rectal cancers were evaluated. Left-sided colon cancer patients were more likely to be female (40.1% versus 32.6%; P < 0.0001) and older (31.0% ≥ 70 years versus 25.8%; P = 0.0033) compared with rectal cancers patients. Patients with left-sided colon cancer had higher rates of liver metastases (80.9% versus 72.3%, P < 0.0001) but lower rates of lung metastases (34.2% versus 53.8%, P < 0.0001). KRAS mutations were slightly less frequent among left-sided tumours (34.8% versus 40.5%; P = 0.0103).

Pelvic MRI after induction chemotherapy and before long-course chemoradiation therapy for rectal cancer: What are the imaging findings?,European radiology,Eur Radiol,2018-10-02,"To determine the appearance of rectal cancer on MRI after oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (ICT) and make a preliminary assessment of MRI's value in predicting response to total neoadjuvant treatment (TNT). In this IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant, retrospective study between 1 January 2010-20 October 2014, pre- and post-ICT tumour T2 volume, relative T2 signal intensity (rT2SI), node size, signal intensity and border characteristics were assessed in 63 patients (65 tumours) by three readers. The strength of association between the reference standard of histopathological percent tumour response and tumour volume change, rT2SI and lymph node characteristics was assessed with Spearman's correlation coefficient and Wilcoxon's rank sum test. Cox regression was used to assess association between DFS and radiological measures. Change in T2 volume was not associated with TNT response. Change in rT2SI showed correlation with TNT response for one reader only using selective regions of interest (ROIs) and borderline correlation with response using total volume ROI. There was a significant negative correlation between baseline and post-ICT node size and TNT response (r = -0.25, p = 0.05; r = -0.35, p = 0.005, readers 1 and 2, respectively). Both baseline and post-induction median node sizes were significantly smaller in complete responders (p = 0.03, 0.001; readers 1 and 2, respectively). Change in largest baseline node size and decrease in post-ICT node signal heterogeneity were associated with 100% tumour response (p = 0.04). Nodal sizes at baseline and post-ICT MRI correlated with DFS. In patients undergoing post-ICT MRI, tumour volume did not correlate with TNT response, but decreased lymph node sizes were significantly associated with complete response to TNT as well as DFS.

PI3K p110δ inactivation antagonizes chronic lymphocytic leukemia and reverses T cell immune suppression.,The Journal of clinical investigation,J. Clin. Invest.,2018-11-19,"Targeted therapy with small molecules directed at essential survival pathways in leukemia represents a major advance, including the phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (PI3K) p110δ inhibitor idelalisib. Here, we found that genetic inactivation of p110δ (p110δD910A/D910A) in the Eμ-TCL1 murine chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) model impaired B cell receptor signaling and B cell migration, and significantly delayed leukemia pathogenesis. Regardless of TCL1 expression, p110δ inactivation led to rectal prolapse in mice resembling autoimmune colitis in patients receiving idelalisib. Moreover, we showed that p110δ inactivation in the microenvironment protected against CLL and acute myeloid leukemia. After receiving higher numbers of TCL1 leukemia cells, half of p110δD910A/D910A mice spontaneously recovered from high disease burden and resisted leukemia rechallenge. Despite disease resistance, p110δD910A/D910A mice exhibited compromised CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response, and depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells restored leukemia. Interestingly, p110δD910A/D910A mice showed significantly impaired Treg expansion that associated with disease clearance. Reconstitution of p110δD910A/D910A mice with p110δWT/WT Tregs reversed leukemia resistance.

Management of disseminated intravascular coagulation in a patient with hepatic angiosarcoma: A case report.,Medicine,Medicine (Baltimore),2018-11-01,"Hepatic angiosarcoma is a rare endothelial cell tumor that may lead to concurrent consumptive coagulopathies including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This report details a multifaceted approach to managing DIC in a patient with advanced-stage hepatic angiosarcoma, which continued to progress after a brief response to taxane-based chemotherapy. A 55-year-old man with a recent history of hemorrhoids and hemarthroses presented with acute rectal bleeding. He was found to have concurrent hepatomegaly, abnormal liver function tests, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. DIC in the setting of hepatic angiosarcoma. The patient's acute bleeding in the setting of DIC was controlled with a combination of antifibrinolytic agents to prevent clot breakdown, heparin products to prevent deposition of new clot, and romiplostim to increase platelet production. His angiosarcoma was treated with various combinations of chemotherapy, including taxane-based chemotherapy, doxorubicin, and pazopanib.

Predictive Value of Leukocyte- and Platelet-Derived Ratios in Rectal Adenocarcinoma.,The Journal of surgical research,J. Surg. Res.,2018-07-14,"Advances in treatment of rectal cancer have improved survival, but there is variability in response to therapy. Recent data suggest the utility of the lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in predicting survival. Our aim was to examine these ratios in rectal cancer patients and determine whether any association exists with overall survival (OS). Using prospectively maintained institutional data, a query was completed for clinical stage II-III rectal adenocarcinoma patients treated from 2002 to 2016. We included patients who had a complete blood count collected before neoadjuvant chemoradiation (pre-CRT) and again before surgery (post-CRT). The LMR, NLR, and PLR were calculated for the pre-CRT and post-CRT time points. Potential cutpoints associated with OS differences were determined using maximally selected rank statistics. Survival curves were compared using log-rank tests and were adjusted for age and stage using Cox regression. A total of 146 patients were included. Cutpoints were significantly associated with OS for pre-CRT ratios but not for post-CRT ratios. Within the pretreatment group, a ""low"" (<2.86) LMR was associated with decreased OS (log-rank P = 0.004). In the same group, a ""high"" (>4.47) NLR and ""high"" PLR (>203.6) were associated with decreased OS (log-rank P < 0.001). With covariate adjustment for age, and separately for final pathologic stage, the associations between OS and LMR, NLR, and PLR each retained statistical significance. If obtained before the start of neoadjuvant chemoradiation, LMR, NLR, and PLR values are accurate predictors of 5-y OS in patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma.",Journal Article,556.0,4.0,Advances in treatment of cancer have improved survival but there is variability in response to therapy Recent data suggest the utility of the lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio LMR neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio NLR and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio PLR in predicting survival Our aim was to examine these ratios in cancer patients and determine whether any association exists with overall survival OS Using prospectively maintained institutional data a query was completed for clinical stage II-III adenocarcinoma patients treated from 2002 to 2016 We included patients who had a complete blood count collected before neoadjuvant chemoradiation pre-CRT and again before surgery post-CRT The LMR NLR and PLR were calculated for the pre-CRT and post-CRT time points Potential cutpoints associated with OS differences were determined using maximally selected rank statistics Survival curves were compared using log-rank tests and were adjusted for age and stage using Cox regression A total of 146 patients were included Cutpoints were significantly associated with OS for pre-CRT ratios but not for post-CRT ratios Within the pretreatment group a `` low '' 2.86 LMR was associated with decreased OS log-rank P 0.004 In the same group a `` high '' 4.47 NLR and `` high '' PLR 203.6 were associated with decreased OS log-rank P 0.001 With covariate adjustment for age and separately for final pathologic stage the associations between OS and LMR NLR and PLR each retained statistical significance If obtained before the start of neoadjuvant chemoradiation LMR NLR and PLR values are accurate predictors of 5-y OS in patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[954, 4, 24, 1, 12, 47, 231, 25, 84, 125, 16, 1982, 4, 51, 6, 36, 435, 74, 309, 3, 1207, 1, 3, 1448, 6, 5231, 197, 14701, 2595, 6, 1448, 197, 3349, 2, 1596, 6, 1448, 197, 12059, 4, 1434, 25, 114, 1130, 10, 6, 1004, 46, 1137, 4, 12, 7, 2, 223, 317, 500, 248, 2481, 5, 63, 25, 118, 75, 1143, 1955, 1115, 74, 8, 12259, 10, 781, 9, 38, 82, 215, 316, 449, 7, 73, 29, 1544, 6, 1390, 21, 159, 7, 54, 42, 8, 236, 315, 1276, 786, 348, 536, 975, 671, 1089, 2, 5089, 348, 152, 539, 1089, 3, 14701, 3349, 2, 12059, 11, 981, 9, 3, 671, 1089, 2, 539, 1089, 98, 862, 174, 17790, 41, 5, 118, 362, 11, 509, 75, 6402, 715, 1026, 3065, 25, 2400, 11, 72, 75, 1066, 1026, 895, 2, 11, 586, 9, 89, 2, 82, 75, 418, 320, 8, 181, 1, 4909, 7, 11, 159, 17790, 11, 97, 41, 5, 118, 9, 671, 1089, 1137, 84, 44, 9, 539, 1089, 1137, 262, 3, 1194, 87, 8, 154, 522, 18, 868, 14701, 10, 41, 5, 340, 118, 1066, 1026, 19, 13, 1520, 4, 3, 827, 87, 8, 64, 522, 39, 662, 3349, 2, 64, 522, 12059, 5426, 49, 11, 41, 5, 340, 118, 1066, 1026, 19, 13, 144, 5, 6322, 1852, 9, 89, 2, 3582, 9, 1457, 510, 82, 3, 685, 59, 118, 2, 14701, 3349, 2, 12059, 296, 3532, 1050, 724, 492, 683, 348, 3, 2435, 1, 536, 975, 14701, 3349, 2, 12059, 1030, 32, 1481, 674, 1, 33, 2055, 118, 4, 7, 5, 795, 131, 449]",1651.0,30463730,279
A Matched-Pair Study Comparing Surgery Plus Neoadjuvant Radio-Chemotherapy and Surgery Alone for High Rectal Cancers.,Anticancer research,Anticancer Res.,2018-12-01,"The value of neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy for high rectal cancers is controversial. This study compared surgery plus neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy to surgery alone. Fifty-two patients with stage II/III high rectal cancers treated with surgery plus neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy were matched (1:4) to 208 patients treated with surgery alone. Matching criteria included age (≤65 vs. >65 years), gender and UICC-stage (II vs. III). These criteria were identical in all five patients used for each 1:4 matching. Both groups were compared for overall survival (OS). On univariate analyses, age ≤65 years (p<0.001) was significantly associated with improved OS. A trend towards improved OS was found for neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (p=0.078) and UICC-stage II (p=0.060). On multivariate analysis, age (p<0.001) remained significant, and neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy showed a trend towards better OS (p=0.073).

Pelvic Complications After Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy and Their Management: An International Collaborative Narrative Review.,European urology,Eur. Urol.,2018-12-17,"Radiotherapy used for treating localized prostate cancer is effective at prolonging cancer-specific and overall survival. Still, acute and late pelvic toxicities are a concern, with gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) sequelae being most common as well as other pelvic complications. To present a critical review of the literature regarding the incidence and risk factors of pelvic toxicity following primary radiotherapy for prostate cancer and to provide a narrative review regarding its management. A collaborative narrative review of the literature from 2010 to present was conducted. Regardless of the modality used, the incidence of acute high-grade pelvic toxicity is low following conventionally fractionated external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). After moderate hypofractionation, the crude cumulative incidences for late grade 3 or higher (G3+) GI and GU complications are as high as 6% and 7%, respectively. After extreme hypofractionation, the 5-yr incidences of G2+ GU and GI toxicities are 3-9% and 0-4%, respectively. Following brachytherapy monotherapy, crude rates of late G3+ GU toxicity range from 6% to 8%, while late GI toxicity is rare. With combination therapy (EBRT and brachytherapy), the cumulative incidence of late GU toxicity is high, between 18% and 31%; however, the prevalence is lower at 4-14%. Whole pelvic radiotherapy remains a controversial treatment option as there is increased G3+ GI toxicity compared with prostate-only treatment, with no overall survival benefit. Proton beam therapy appears to have similar toxicity to photon therapies currently in use. With respect to specific complications, urinary obstruction and urethral stricture are the most common severe urinary toxicities. Rectal and urinary bleeding can be recurrent long-term toxicities. The risk of hip fracture is also increased following prostate radiotherapy. The literature is mixed on the risk of in-field secondary pelvic malignancies following prostate radiotherapy. Urinary and GI fistulas are rare complications. Management of these toxicities may require invasive treatment and reconstructive surgery for refractory and severe symptoms. There has been progress in the delivery of radiotherapy, enabling the administration of higher doses with minimal tradeoff in terms of slightly increased or equal toxicity. There is a need to focus future improvements in radiotherapy on sparing critical structures to reduce GU and GI morbidities. While complications such as fistulae, bone toxicity, and secondary malignancy are rare, there is a need for higher-quality studies assessing these outcomes and their management. In this report, we review the literature regarding pelvic complications following modern primary prostate cancer radiotherapy and their management.

Cancer,2018-12-21,"Right-sided colon cancer (RCC) has worse prognosis compared to left-sided colon cancer (LCC) and rectal cancer. The reason for this difference in outcomes is not well understood. We performed comparative somatic and proteomic analyses of RCC, LCC and rectal cancers to understand the unique molecular features of each tumor sub-types. Utilizing a novel in silico clonal evolution algorithm, we identified common tumor-initiating events involving APC, KRAS and TP53 genes in RCC, LCC and rectal cancers. However, the individual role-played by each event, their order in tumor development and selection of downstream somatic alterations were distinct in all three anatomical locations. Some similarities were noted between LCC and rectal cancer. Hotspot mutation analysis identified a nonsense mutation, APC R1450* specific to RCC. In addition, we discovered new significantly mutated genes at each tumor location, Further in silico proteomic analysis, developed by our group, found distinct central or hub proteins with unique interactomes among each location.

Clinical and Molecular Comparative Study of Colorectal Cancer Based on Age-of-onset and Tumor Location: Two Main Criteria for Subclassifying Colorectal Cancer.,International journal of molecular sciences,Int J Mol Sci,2019-02-22,"Our aim was to characterize and validate that the location and age of onset of the tumor are both important criteria to classify colorectal cancer (CRC). We analyzed clinical and molecular characteristics of early-onset CRC (EOCRC) and late-onset CRC (LOCRC), and we compared each tumor location between both ages-of-onset. In right-sided colon tumors, early-onset cases showed extensive Lynch syndrome (LS) features, with a relatively low frequency of chromosomal instability (CIN), but a high CpG island methylation phenotype. Nevertheless, late-onset cases showed predominantly sporadic features and microsatellite instability cases due to <i>BRAF</i> mutations. In left colon cancers, the most reliable clinical features were the tendency to develop polyps as well as multiple primary CRC associated with the late-onset subset. Apart from the higher degree of CIN in left-sided early-onset cancers, differential copy number alterations were also observed. Differences among rectal cancers showed that early-onset rectal cancers were diagnosed at later stages, had less association with polyps, and more than half of them were associated with a familial LS component. Stratifying CRC according to both location and age-of-onset criteria is meaningful, not only because it correlates the resulting categories with certain molecular bases, but with the confirmation across larger studies, new therapeutical algorithms could be defined according to this subclassification.",Comparative Study,333.0,3.0,Our aim was to characterize and validate that the location and age of onset of the tumor are both important criteria to classify cancer CRC We analyzed clinical and molecular characteristics of early-onset CRC EOCRC and late-onset CRC LOCRC and we compared each tumor location between both ages-of-onset In right-sided tumors early-onset cases showed extensive Lynch syndrome LS features with a relatively low frequency of chromosomal instability CIN but a high CpG island methylation phenotype Nevertheless late-onset cases showed predominantly sporadic features and microsatellite instability cases due to i BRAF /i mutations In left cancers the most reliable clinical features were the tendency to develop polyps as well as multiple primary CRC associated with the late-onset subset Apart from the higher degree of CIN in left-sided early-onset cancers differential copy number alterations were also observed Differences among cancers showed that early-onset cancers were diagnosed at later stages had less association with polyps and more than half of them were associated with a familial LS component Stratifying CRC according to both location and age-of-onset criteria is meaningful not only because it correlates the resulting categories with certain molecular bases but with the confirmation across larger studies new therapeutical algorithms could be defined according to this subclassification,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[114, 1130, 10, 6, 1507, 2, 2183, 17, 3, 1147, 2, 89, 1, 1707, 1, 3, 30, 32, 110, 305, 371, 6, 4896, 12, 590, 21, 311, 38, 2, 219, 374, 1, 191, 1707, 590, 24347, 2, 807, 1707, 590, 30037, 2, 21, 72, 296, 30, 1147, 59, 110, 2165, 1, 1707, 4, 1913, 1689, 57, 191, 1707, 140, 224, 1344, 3546, 681, 3153, 404, 5, 8, 1352, 154, 675, 1, 1860, 1753, 4652, 84, 8, 64, 2075, 3454, 569, 1005, 3873, 807, 1707, 140, 224, 2117, 1928, 404, 2, 2226, 1753, 140, 520, 6, 70, 566, 70, 138, 4, 1712, 163, 3, 96, 2450, 38, 404, 11, 3, 7135, 6, 690, 3742, 22, 149, 22, 232, 86, 590, 41, 5, 3, 807, 1707, 697, 5461, 29, 3, 142, 1444, 1, 4652, 4, 1712, 1689, 191, 1707, 163, 1777, 1337, 207, 593, 11, 120, 164, 362, 107, 163, 224, 17, 191, 1707, 163, 11, 265, 28, 1559, 1153, 42, 299, 248, 5, 3742, 2, 80, 76, 1303, 1, 1370, 11, 41, 5, 8, 2200, 3153, 1249, 5035, 590, 768, 6, 110, 1147, 2, 89, 1, 1707, 371, 16, 2538, 44, 158, 408, 192, 1871, 3, 1113, 1996, 5, 1840, 219, 9412, 84, 5, 3, 3551, 716, 1077, 94, 217, 43165, 3529, 359, 40, 395, 768, 6, 26, 9341]",1403.0,30813366,283

J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2019-03-02,"To determine the long-term outcomes for prostate adenocarcinoma when escalating radiation dose from 70 Gy to 78 Gy. Between 1993 and 1998, 301 patients with biopsy-proven clinical stage T1b-T3 prostate adenocarcinoma, any prostate-specific antigen level, and any Gleason score were randomized to 70 Gy in 35 fractions versus 78 Gy in 39 fractions of photon radiation therapy using a 4-field box technique without hormone deprivation therapy. The primary outcome was powered to detect a 15% difference in biochemical or clinical failure. Secondary outcomes included survival, prostate cancer mortality, biochemical failure, local failure, nodal failure, distant failure, and secondary malignancy rates. With a median follow-up of 14.3 years, the cumulative incidence of 15-year biochemical or clinical failure was 18.9% versus 12.0% in the 70 Gy versus 78 Gy arms, respectively (subhazard ratio [sHR], 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-0.98; Fine-Gray P = .042). The 15-year cumulative incidence of distant metastasis was 3.4% versus 1.1%, respectively (sHR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.13-0.82; Fine-Gray P = .018).

There were no differences in overall survival (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.84-1.45; log rank P = .469) or other-cause survival (sHR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.99-1.79; Fine-Gray P = .061). Salvage therapy was more common in the 70 Gy arm, at 38.7% versus 21.9% in the 78 Gy arm (P = .002). There was a 2.3% secondary solid malignancy rate (1 bladder, 6 rectal) within the radiation treatment field, which was not significantly different between treatment arms. Dose escalation by 8 Gy (78 Gy vs 70 Gy) provided a sustained improvement in biochemical and clinical failure, which translated into lower salvage rates and improved prostate cancer-specific mortality, but not overall survival.

"Four percent formalin application for the management of radiation proctitis in carcinoma cervix patients: An effective, safe, and economical practice.",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,J Cancer Res Ther,,"Radiotherapy is a very effective treatment modality for pelvic malignancies such as carcinoma of the cervix. However, it is quite common for chronic radiation proctitis (CRP) to manifest after radical radiotherapy. CRP is a source of significant morbidity, and there is a lack of effective treatment modalities. There also exists a general lack of guidelines on management of CRP. To assess the benefit from 4% formalin application for the treatment of Grade >2 CRP among patients previously treated with radical radiotherapy for cervical carcinoma. This retrospective descriptive study involved 29 eligible patients who were treated from November 2010 - November 2015 for CRP with 4% formalin application. Of the 1864 patients of carcinoma cervix treated during the said patients, 29 patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Eligible patients were invited telephonically for follow-up and were assessed for response and complications of the procedure.

Role of the Interval from Completion of Neoadjuvant Therapy to Surgery in Postoperative Morbidity in Patients with Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg.

Among 607 patients, the surgery was performed at < 8 weeks in 317 patients, 8-12 weeks in 229 patients, and 12-16 weeks in 61 patients. Patients who underwent surgery at 8-12 weeks and patients who underwent surgery at < 8 weeks had comparable rates of complications (37% and 44%, respectively). Univariable analysis identified male sex, earlier date of diagnosis, tumor location within 5 cm of the anal verge, open operative approach, abdominoperineal resection, and use of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy alone to be associated with higher rates of complications. In multivariable analysis, male sex, tumor location within 5 cm of the anal verge, open operative approach, and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy administered alone were independently associated with the presence of a complication.

"For Patients with Early Rectal Cancer, Does Local Excision Have an Impact on Recurrence, Survival, and Quality of Life Relative to Radical Resection?",Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2019-04-25,"The most appropriate treatment for early-stage rectal cancers is controversial. The advantages of local excision regarding morbidity and function must be weighed against poorer oncologic efficacy. This study aimed to clarify further the role for local excision in the treatment of rectal cancer. A systematic review of Medline, SCOPUS, and Cochrane databases was conducted. Relevant studies were selected using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data addressing five key questions about outcomes of local versus radical resection of rectal cancer were analyzed. The 16 studies identified by this study were mostly retrospective, and none were randomized. Local excision was associated with fewer complications and better functional outcome than radical resection. Of 12 studies evaluating local recurrence, 6 showed a higher local recurrence rate among patients who underwent local excision. Two additional studies showed no increase in local recurrence rate among patients who underwent local excision of T1 lesions but a significantly higher local recurrence rate among those who underwent local excision of T2 lesions. High histologic grade, angiolymphatic invasion, perineural invasion, and depth within submucosa were features associated with a higher risk of local recurrence. In 7 of 15 studies, long-term survival was reduced compared with that of patients who underwent radical resection.

The Pelvis-First Approach for Robotic Proctectomy in Patients with Redundant Abdominal Colon.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2019-05-17,"Robotic surgery is increasingly performed for low rectal cancer.1 A redundant sigmoid colon makes retraction and pelvic dissection challenging. We present a 'pelvis-first' approach to robotic proctectomy where pelvic dissection occurs prior to colonic mobilization. A 26-year-old woman was diagnosed with a clinical T3N1 rectal adenocarcinoma at 3 cm from the anal verge. The patient had Lynch syndrome, with a germline mutation in the PMS2 gene. A near-complete clinical response was observed after neoadjuvant chemoradiation (NCRT), and the patient wished to delay surgery and permanent colostomy. Additional FOLFOX was administered and led to a complete clinical response. After 2.5 months of watchful delay of surgery, the tumor regrew, and the patient then underwent robotic abdominoperineal resection (APR). Initial exploration revealed a highly redundant sigmoid colon. A pelvis-first approach was undertaken. The colon was left tethered and outside of the pelvis during the pelvic dissection. The levator ani was divided transabdominally. Vascular dissection and left colon mobilization were completed after pelvic dissection.2 The specimen was removed transanally, obviating the need for abdominal incision. An end colostomy was created laparoscopically, and the perineum was closed primarily after omental flap. The patient recovered without complications. The 'pelvis-first' approach to proctectomy is advantageous for patients with a highly redundant sigmoid colon. Transabdominal division of the levator ani during APR ensures excellent circumferential margin. Although Lynch syndrome-associated rectal cancer can show excellent response to NCRT,3 patients undergoing watchful delay of surgery require close monitoring and prompt triggering of salvage proctectomy when tumor regrowth is observed.4<sup>,</sup>5.",Case Reports,249.0,1.0,"Robotic surgery is increasingly performed for low cancer.1 A redundant sigmoid makes retraction and pelvic dissection challenging We present a 'pelvis-first approach to robotic proctectomy where pelvic dissection occurs prior to colonic mobilization A 26-year-old woman was diagnosed with a clinical T3N1 adenocarcinoma at 3 cm from the verge The patient had Lynch syndrome with a germline mutation in the PMS2 gene A near-complete clinical response was observed after neoadjuvant chemoradiation NCRT and the patient wished to delay surgery and permanent colostomy Additional FOLFOX was administered and led to a complete clinical response After 2.5 months of watchful delay of surgery the tumor regrew and the patient then underwent robotic abdominoperineal resection APR Initial exploration revealed a highly redundant sigmoid A pelvis-first approach was undertaken The was left tethered and outside of the pelvis during the pelvic dissection The levator ani was divided transabdominally Vascular dissection and left mobilization were completed after pelvic dissection.2 The specimen was removed transanally obviating the need for abdominal incision An end colostomy was created laparoscopically and the perineum was closed primarily after omental flap The patient recovered without complications The 'pelvis-first approach to proctectomy is advantageous for patients with a highly redundant sigmoid Transabdominal division of the levator ani during APR ensures excellent circumferential margin Although Lynch syndrome-associated cancer can show excellent response to NCRT,3 patients undergoing watchful delay of surgery require close monitoring and prompt triggering of salvage proctectomy when tumor regrowth is observed.4 sup /sup 5",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[2895, 152, 16, 1635, 173, 9, 154, 12, 14, 8, 10716, 9356, 4677, 16286, 2, 1110, 1161, 1950, 21, 364, 8, 51531, 157, 353, 6, 2895, 12899, 1257, 1110, 1161, 1780, 324, 6, 3663, 4030, 8, 432, 111, 1095, 2854, 10, 265, 5, 8, 38, 17641, 449, 28, 27, 494, 29, 3, 8330, 3, 69, 42, 3546, 681, 5, 8, 1009, 258, 4, 3, 7300, 145, 8, 1829, 236, 38, 51, 10, 164, 50, 536, 975, 8353, 2, 3, 69, 11382, 6, 1984, 152, 2, 4377, 7635, 402, 3777, 10, 468, 2, 836, 6, 8, 236, 38, 51, 50, 18, 33, 53, 1, 10689, 1984, 1, 152, 3, 30, 33566, 2, 3, 69, 818, 208, 2895, 8177, 170, 7012, 388, 3370, 553, 8, 561, 10716, 9356, 8, 3270, 157, 353, 10, 2789, 3, 10, 1712, 19636, 2, 2513, 1, 3, 3270, 190, 3, 1110, 1161, 3, 28927, 34566, 10, 2176, 74799, 756, 1161, 2, 1712, 4030, 11, 781, 50, 1110, 1161, 18, 3, 2360, 10, 2264, 44183, 21174, 3, 594, 9, 1467, 7538, 35, 396, 7635, 10, 2466, 11472, 2, 3, 33547, 10, 3745, 1561, 50, 11404, 3942, 3, 69, 5784, 187, 521, 3, 51531, 157, 353, 6, 12899, 16, 10650, 9, 7, 5, 8, 561, 10716, 9356, 16333, 5750, 1, 3, 28927, 34566, 190, 7012, 18467, 1503, 7937, 959, 242, 3546, 681, 41, 12, 122, 514, 1503, 51, 6, 8353, 27, 7, 479, 10689, 1984, 1, 152, 1353, 2336, 1315, 2, 4776, 8867, 1, 992, 12899, 198, 30, 8673, 16, 164, 39, 172, 172, 33]",1737.0,31102088,5
"Oral antibiotic use and risk of colorectal cancer in the United Kingdom, 1989-2012: a matched case-control study.",Gut,Gut,2019-08-19,"Microbiome dysbiosis predisposes to colorectal cancer (CRC), but a population-based study of oral antibiotic exposure and risk patterns is lacking. To assess the association between oral antibiotic use and CRC risk. A matched case-control study (incident CRC cases and up to five matched controls) was performed using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink from 1989 to 2012. 28 980 CRC cases and 137 077 controls were identified. Oral antibiotic use was associated with CRC risk, but effects differed by anatomical location. Antibiotic use increased the risk of colon cancer in a dose-dependent fashion (p<sub>trend</sub> <0.001). The risk was observed after minimal use, and was greatest in the proximal colon and with antibiotics with anti-anaerobic activity. In contrast, an inverse association was detected between antibiotic use and rectal cancers (p<sub>trend</sub>=0.003), particularly with length of antibiotic exposure >60 days (adjusted OR (aOR), 0.85, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.93) as compared with no antibiotic exposure. Penicillins, particularly ampicillin/amoxicillin increased the risk of colon cancer (aOR=1.09 (1.05 to 1.13)), whereas tetracyclines reduced the risk of rectal cancer (aOR=0.90 (0.84 to 0.97)). Significant interactions were detected between antibiotic use and tumour location (colon vs rectum, p<sub>interaction</sub><0.001; proximal colon versus distal colon, p<sub>interaction</sub>=0.019).

A novel preoperative risk score to predict lymph node positivity for rectal neuroendocrine tumors: An NCDB analysis to guide operative technique.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2019-08-26,"Staging and type of resection for rectal neuroendocrine tumors (R-NETS) relies on preoperative identification of lymph node (LN) involvement. Study objective was to develop a Preoperative Rectal Stratification Score (PReSS) for LN-positivity and to assess the association of PReSS with overall survival (OS). All patients in the National Cancer Database (2004-2014) with non-metastatic/nonfunctional R-NETS were included. Tumor size was divided into three categories (<1, 1-2, and ≥2 cm). Among 383 patients, median age was 57 years, 52% were male (n = 200), median tumor size was 1.4 cm, 43% had positive LNs (n = 163). On univariate analysis, age  > 60, poorly differentiated grade, depth of invasion past submucosa, and size >1 cm were associated with LN positivity. On multivariable analysis, depth of invasion past submucosa, and increasing tumor size >1 cm remained associated with LN positivity. As these can be determined preoperatively, incidence of LN positivity was determined for each combination of tumor size and depth of invasion. Each variable was assigned a score to create a PReSS of four groups (0-3) associated with an increasing rate of LN-positivity (PReSS group 0: 11%, 1: 38%, 2: 50%, 3: 78%, P < .01). PReSS correlated with 10-year OS (PReSS 0: 90%; 1: 81%; 2: 59%; 3: 41%). For R-NETS, depth of invasion and tumor size predict LN positivity and both can be obtained preoperatively. PReSS incorporates both variables and stratifies tumors into four risk groups of progressively increasing LN positivity and should be used to guide surgical approach.",Journal Article,148.0,0.0,Staging and type of resection for neuroendocrine tumors R-NETS relies on preoperative identification of lymph node LN involvement Study objective was to develop a Preoperative Stratification Score PReSS for LN-positivity and to assess the association of PReSS with overall survival OS All patients in the National Cancer Database 2004-2014 with non-metastatic/nonfunctional R-NETS were included Tumor size was divided into three categories 1 1-2 and ≥2 cm Among 383 patients median age was 57 years 52 were male n 200 median tumor size was 1.4 cm 43 had positive LNs n 163 On univariate analysis age 60 poorly differentiated grade depth of invasion past submucosa and size 1 cm were associated with LN positivity On multivariable analysis depth of invasion past submucosa and increasing tumor size 1 cm remained associated with LN positivity As these can be determined preoperatively incidence of LN positivity was determined for each combination of tumor size and depth of invasion Each variable was assigned a score to create a PReSS of four groups 0-3 associated with an increasing rate of LN-positivity PReSS group 0 11 1 38 2 50 3 78 P .01 PReSS correlated with 10-year OS PReSS 0 90 1 81 2 59 3 41 For R-NETS depth of invasion and tumor size predict LN positivity and both can be obtained preoperatively PReSS incorporates both variables and stratifies tumors into four risk groups of progressively increasing LN positivity and should be used to guide surgical approach,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[632, 2, 267, 1, 170, 9, 1542, 57, 668, 2883, 6495, 23, 498, 911, 1, 263, 289, 1763, 799, 45, 461, 10, 6, 690, 8, 498, 1541, 368, 14833, 9, 1763, 1887, 2, 6, 423, 3, 248, 1, 14833, 5, 63, 25, 118, 62, 7, 4, 3, 657, 12, 609, 1131, 1409, 5, 220, 113, 12260, 668, 2883, 11, 159, 30, 444, 10, 2176, 237, 169, 1996, 14, 14, 18, 2, 3107, 494, 107, 10574, 7, 52, 89, 10, 696, 60, 653, 11, 1045, 78, 1250, 52, 30, 444, 10, 14, 39, 494, 601, 42, 109, 2704, 78, 5409, 23, 880, 65, 89, 335, 1240, 1442, 88, 2436, 1, 578, 1219, 13924, 2, 444, 14, 494, 11, 41, 5, 1763, 1887, 23, 658, 65, 2436, 1, 578, 1219, 13924, 2, 602, 30, 444, 14, 494, 958, 41, 5, 1763, 1887, 22, 46, 122, 40, 509, 3888, 287, 1, 1763, 1887, 10, 509, 9, 296, 150, 1, 30, 444, 2, 2436, 1, 578, 296, 1347, 10, 896, 8, 368, 6, 3736, 8, 14833, 1, 294, 271, 13, 27, 41, 5, 35, 602, 116, 1, 1763, 1887, 14833, 87, 13, 175, 14, 519, 18, 212, 27, 833, 19, 355, 14833, 438, 5, 79, 111, 118, 14833, 13, 424, 14, 865, 18, 728, 27, 605, 9, 668, 2883, 2436, 1, 578, 2, 30, 444, 678, 1763, 1887, 2, 110, 122, 40, 683, 3888, 14833, 6175, 110, 682, 2, 12391, 57, 237, 294, 43, 271, 1, 6696, 602, 1763, 1887, 2, 257, 40, 95, 6, 1597, 221, 353]",1475.0,31448820,61
Who Should Get Lateral Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation?,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2019-10-01,"Despite the use of neoadjuvant chemoradiation and total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer, lateral pelvic lymph node recurrence is still an important problem. This study aimed to determine the indication for lateral pelvic lymph node dissection in post neoadjuvant chemoradiation rectal cancer. This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected institutional database. This study was conducted at a tertiary care cancer center from January 2006 through December 2017. Patients who had rectal cancer with suspected lateral pelvic lymph node metastasis, who underwent total mesorectal excision with lateral pelvic lymph node dissection, were included. The primary outcome measured was pathologic lateral pelvic lymph node positivity. The associations between lateral pelvic lymph node size on post-neoadjuvant chemoradiation imaging and pathologic lateral pelvic lymph node positivity and recurrence outcomes were evaluated. A total of 64 patients were analyzed. The mean lateral pelvic lymph node size before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiation was 12.6 ± 9.5 mm and 8.5 ± 5.4 mm. The minimum size of positive lateral pelvic lymph node was 5 mm on post neoadjuvant chemoradiation imaging. Among 13 (20.3%) patients who had a <5 mm lateral pelvic lymph node after neoadjuvant chemoradiation, none were pathologically positive. Among 51 (79.7%) patients who had a ≥5 mm lateral pelvic lymph node after neoadjuvant chemoradiation, 33 patients (64.7%) were pathologically positive. Five-year overall survival and disease-specific survival were higher in the histologic lateral pelvic lymph node negative group than in the lateral pelvic lymph node positive group (overall survival 79.6% vs 61.8%, p = 0.122; disease-specific survival 84.5% vs 66.2%, p= 0.088). After a median 39 months of follow-up, there were no patients in the <5 mm group who died of cancer. There were no lateral compartment recurrences in the entire cohort. Being a single-center retrospective study may limit generalizability. Post-neoadjuvant chemoradiation lateral pelvic lymph node size ≥5 mm was strongly associated with pathologic positivity. No patients with size <5 mm had pathologically positive lymph nodes. Following lateral pelvic lymph node dissection, no patients with a positive lateral pelvic lymph node developed lateral compartment recurrence. Therefore, patients who have rectal cancer with clinical evidence of lateral pelvic lymph node metastasis and post-neoadjuvant chemoradiation lateral pelvic lymph node size ≥5 mm should be considered for lateral pelvic lymph node dissection at the time of total mesorectal excision.

Results of Tri-Modality Therapy for Rectal Cancer in Elderly Patients.,Anticancer research,Anticancer Res.,2019-11-01,"Elderly cancer patients are more prevalent and require special attention. This study focused on the outcome of elderly (≥65 years) rectal cancer patients treated with tri-modality therapy. A total of 105 patients receiving neoadjuvant radio-chemotherapy and resection for locally advanced rectal cancers were retrospectively evaluated. Nine characteristics were analyzed for loco-regional control (LRC), metastases-free survival (MFS) and overall survival (OS) including tumor location, gender, age, performance status, radiotherapy technique, primary tumor/lymph node categories, downstaging and histological grading. The 5-year rates of LRC, MFS and OS were 91%, 78% and 87%, respectively. Radio-chemotherapy was not completed in 12 patients (11%) due to toxicity; 18 patients (17%) experienced grade 3 toxicities. A total of 29 patients (28%) had surgical complications. On multivariate analyses, MFS was significantly associated with downstaging (p=0.003) and OS with lower histological grade (p=0.013). Tri-modality therapy resulted in promising outcomes and was tolerated reasonably well by elderly patients.

Perianal rhabdomyosarcoma presenting as a perirectal abscess: A report of 11 cases.,Journal of pediatric surgery,J. Pediatr. Surg.,2002-04-01,"The organs and soft tissues of the pelvis are some of the most common primary sites for rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) in children and adolescents. In most cases a mass is detectable on clinical examination, and the initial concern is focused on the possibility of a neoplasm. The current report concerns 11 patients, each presented with a painful perineal-perianal mass suggesting an abscess to the extent that each one of these patients was treated initially with antibiotics or incision and drainage for several weeks to months before the pathologic diagnosis of RMS was established. The authors reviewed the clinical histories of all patients with perirectal/perianal RMS from their respective institutions to identify cases in which the initial clinical diagnosis or impression was that of a perirectal abscess. Pathologic material was reviewed in all cases. Eleven patients, 7 of whom were girls, ranged in age from 1 to 16 years at diagnosis (median age, 14 years). Fever accompanied the clinical presentation in 2 patients. None of the patients had a past medical history of illness that may have predisposed them to a perirectal abscess, although one patient had a family history of inflammatory bowel disease. Duration of symptoms ranged from 1 month to 1 year (mean, 4.6 months). Each patient presented with a tender perianal/perineal nodule or mass. Inguinal adenopathy was present in 6 patients at diagnosis. White blood cell counts ranged from 6,600/mm(3) to 24,500/mm(3). LDH levels ranged from 414 to 3,432 U/L.

Oncologic outcomes of salvage surgery for epidermoid carcinoma of the anus initially managed with combined modality therapy.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2004-05-28,"Primary chemoradiation failure for epidermoid carcinoma of the anus is treated by surgical resection. This study evaluates the outcome of salvage surgery at one institution. All patients (n = 177) with a diagnosis of epidermoid carcinoma of the anus undergoing surgery since 1980 were reviewed. After criteria-based exclusion (n = 115), the remaining patients (n = 62) were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed on abdominoperineal resection/low anterior resection patients. Variable comparisons were made using log-rank and Cox regression analyses. Inguinal lymph node dissection patients (n = 5) were analyzed separately. Median follow-up was 24.2 months. Actuarial five-year survival in all abdominoperineal resection/low anterior resection patients (n = 57) was 33 percent (median, 34.1 months). Univariate predictors of decreased survival were tumor size > 5 cm or adjacent organ involvement at salvage, positive nodal disease at salvage, and positive margins. Independent predictors of decreased survival were the same except for tumor size or adjacent organ involvement at salvage (not significant). Patients undergoing potentially curative resections (n = 47) had an actuarial five-year survival of 40 percent (median, 49 months). The univariate and multivariate predictors of both decreased survival and recurrence in this subgroup included: disease persistence after chemoradiation and nodal disease at salvage. Tumor size > 5 cm or adjacent organ involvement at salvage predicted recurrence with only univariate analysis. Interestingly, actuarial five-year survival after potentially curative resection for recurrence after chemoradiation was 51 percent (as opposed to 31 percent for persistence). After potentially curative resections, most documented recurrences (79 percent) occurred within two years and were locoregional (74 percent). Actuarial five-year recurrence-free survival was 46 percent. Three of five inguinal lymph node dissection patients were alive without disease at 21.2, 81.7, and 84.3 months. Salvage surgery after failed chemoradiation therapy has a reasonable chance of cure. Favorable independent prognostic factors include recurrence ( vs. persistence) after chemoradiation (when salvage is potentially curative), absence of nodal disease at salvage, and negative margins.

Typhlitis in childhood cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2005-07-01,"Typhlitis is increasingly recognized in children undergoing chemotherapy but is poorly characterized. The authors investigated the demographic, clinical, and imaging (ultrasonography and computed tomography [CT] scans) variables related to the diagnosis, risk, and outcome of typhlitis. The authors reviewed the records of patients who had typhlitis (bowel wall thickness > or = 0.3 cm plus clinical findings) during treatment at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (Memphis, TN) between 1990 and 2001. They assessed whether duration of typhlitis was related to bowel wall thickness, extent of colonic involvement, ascites, demographics, primary diagnosis, symptoms of typhlitis, or duration of neutropenia. To identify risk factors for typhlitis, the authors compared the demographic data and previous drug therapy of 78 patients who had typhlitis and 1231 identically treated children who did not. Of 3171 children, 83 (2.6%) developed typhlitis. Frequent symptoms were abdominal pain (91%), fever (84%), abdominal tenderness (82%), and diarrhea (72%). Twelve percent of the patients were not neutropenic. Duration of typhlitis was associated with bowel wall thickness measured by ultrasonography (n = 68; P = 0.05) but not CT scan (n = 48; P = 0.67) and was associated with duration of neutropenia (P = 0.02), fever (P = 0.01), and abdominal tenderness (P = 0.04).

Is the 1-cm rule of distal bowel resection margin in rectal cancer based on clinical evidence? A systematic review.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2011-08-31,"Distal intramural spread is present within 1 cm from visible tumor in a substantial proportion of patients. Therefore, ≥ 1 cm of distal bowel clearance is recommended as minimally acceptable. However, clinical results are contradictory in answering the question of whether this rule is valid. The aim of this review was to evaluate whether in patients undergoing anterior resection, a distal bowel gross margin of <1 cm jeopardizes oncologic safety. A systematic review of the literature identified 17 studies showing results in relation to margins of approximately <1 cm (948 patients) versus >1 cm (4626 patients); five studies in relation to a margin of ≤ 5 mm (173 patients) versus >5 mm (1277 patients), and five studies showing results in a margin of ≤ 2 mm (73 patients). In most studies, pre- or postoperative radiation was provided. A multifactorial process was identified resulting in selection of favorable tumors for anterior resection with the short bowel margin and unfavorable tumors for abdominoperineal resection or for anterior resection with the long margin. In total, the local recurrence rate was 1.0% higher in the <1-cm margin group compared to the >1-cm margin group (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.6 to 2.7; P = 0.175). The corresponding figures for ≤ 5 mm cutoff point were 1.7% (95% CI -1.9 to 5.3; P = 0.375). The pooled local recurrence rate in patients having ≤ 2 mm margin was 2.7% (95% CI 0 to 6.4).

Anterior fascial fixation does not reduce the parastomal hernia rate after radical cystectomy and ileal conduit.,Urology,Urology,2014-04-24,"To compare the rate of parastomal hernia in patients undergoing anterior fascial fixation of the ileal conduit with that in patients without fascial fixation. Limited data exist on whether anterior fascial fixation of the ileal conduit impacts the rate of parastomal hernia. A total of 496 consecutive patients undergoing radical cystectomy and ileal conduit reconstruction from 1995 to 2012 were retrospectively evaluated for parastomal hernia. All patients had a 2-fingerbreadth aperture and the ileal conduit brought through the rectus muscle and sheath. Patients were divided into 1 of 3 groups based on stoma fixation and/or reinforcement: anterior fascial fixation, posterior reinforcement, or no fascial fixation. A parastomal hernia was defined as a palpable bulge at the stoma site. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted for the primary end point of parastomal hernia, controlling for other patient- and treatment-related factors that might affect the rate of parastomal hernia. Median follow-up was 16 months (range, 1-189 months). The parastomal hernia rate was significantly greater in the anterior fascial suture group (43 of 281; 15.3%) than the no fascial suture group (12 of 164; 7.3%; P=.02). Multivariate logistic regression analysis modeled for the occurrence of a parastomal hernia demonstrated that anterior fascial fixation was an independent predictor of the development of parastomal hernia (odds ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-5.14; P=.04).

Methylation of MGMT Is Associated with Poor Prognosis in Patients with Stage III Duodenal Adenocarcinoma.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2016-09-19,"O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status has not been extensively investigated in duodenal adenocarcinoma (DA). The aim of this study was to evaluate the MGMT methylation status and examine its possible prognostic value in patients with stage III DA. Demographics, tumor characteristics and survival were available for 64 patients with stage III DA. MGMT methylation was detected by using MethyLight. A Cox proportional hazard model was built to predict survival, adjusted for clinicopathological characteristics and tumor molecular features, including the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), microsatellite instability (MSI), and KRAS mutations. MGMT methylation was detected in 17 of 64 (26.6%) patients, and was not correlated with sex, age, tumor differentiation, CIMP, MSI, or KRAS mutations. MGMT methylation was the only one factor associated with both overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) on both univariate and multivariate analyses. In patients treated with surgery alone, MGMT-methylated group had worse OS and DFS when compared with MGMT-unmethylated group.

"First-in-Human Phase I Study of the Oral Inhibitor of Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase-1 Epacadostat (INCB024360) in Patients with Advanced Solid Malignancies.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2017-01-04,"<b>Purpose:</b> Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) catalyzes the degradation of tryptophan to N-formyl-kynurenine. Overexpressed in many solid malignancies, IDO1 can promote tumor escape from host immunosurveillance. This first-in-human phase I study investigated the maximum tolerated dose, safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of epacadostat (INCB024360), a potent and selective inhibitor of IDO1.<b>Experimental Design:</b> Fifty-two patients with advanced solid malignancies were treated with epacadostat [50 mg once daily or 50, 100, 300, 400, 500, 600, or 700 mg twice daily (BID)] in a dose-escalation 3 + 3 design and evaluated in 28-day cycles. Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.<b>Results:</b> One dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred at the dose of 300 mg BID (grade 3, radiation pneumonitis); another DLT occurred at 400 mg BID (grade 3, fatigue). The most common adverse events in >20% of patients overall were fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspnea, back pain, and cough. Treatment produced significant dose-dependent reductions in plasma kynurenine levels and in the plasma kynurenine/tryptophan ratio at all doses and in all patients. Near maximal changes were observed at doses of ≥100 mg BID with >80% to 90% inhibition of IDO1 achieved throughout the dosing period. Although no objective responses were detected, stable disease lasting ≥16 weeks was observed in 7 of 52 patients.<b>Conclusions:</b> Epacadostat was generally well tolerated, effectively normalized kynurenine levels, and produced maximal inhibition of IDO1 activity at doses of ≥100 mg BID. Studies investigating epacadostat in combination with other immunomodulatory drugs are ongoing. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(13); 3269-76. ©2017 AACR</i>.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",1112.0,107.0,"b Purpose /b Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 IDO1 catalyzes the degradation of tryptophan to N-formyl-kynurenine Overexpressed in many solid malignancies IDO1 can promote tumor escape from host immunosurveillance This first-in-human phase I study investigated the maximum tolerated dose safety pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics and antitumor activity of epacadostat INCB024360 a potent and selective inhibitor of IDO1. b Experimental Design /b Fifty-two patients with advanced solid malignancies were treated with epacadostat 50 mg once daily or 50 100 300 400 500 600 or 700 mg twice daily BID in a dose-escalation 3 3 design and evaluated in 28-day cycles Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. b Results /b One dose-limiting toxicity DLT occurred at the dose of 300 mg BID grade 3 radiation pneumonitis another DLT occurred at 400 mg BID grade 3 fatigue The most common adverse events in 20 of patients overall were fatigue nausea decreased appetite vomiting constipation abdominal pain diarrhea dyspnea back pain and cough Treatment produced significant dose-dependent reductions in plasma kynurenine levels and in the plasma kynurenine/tryptophan ratio at all doses and in all patients Near maximal changes were observed at doses of ≥100 mg BID with 80 to 90 inhibition of IDO1 achieved throughout the dosing period Although no objective responses were detected stable disease lasting ≥16 weeks was observed in 7 of 52 patients. b Conclusions /b Epacadostat was generally well tolerated effectively normalized kynurenine levels and produced maximal inhibition of IDO1 activity at doses of ≥100 mg BID Studies investigating epacadostat in combination with other immunomodulatory drugs are ongoing i Clin Cancer Res 23 13 3269-76 ©2017 AACR /i",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[132, 743, 132, 10566, 18, 27, 9175, 14, 13741, 11074, 3, 2373, 1, 6549, 6, 78, 39218, 13634, 1711, 4, 445, 537, 441, 13741, 122, 1617, 30, 3776, 29, 1204, 15169, 26, 157, 4, 171, 124, 70, 45, 565, 3, 689, 421, 61, 367, 1159, 3587, 2, 579, 128, 1, 36999, 52427, 8, 1157, 2, 1094, 230, 1, 13741, 132, 1560, 771, 132, 1461, 100, 7, 5, 131, 537, 441, 11, 73, 5, 36999, 212, 81, 1059, 391, 15, 212, 394, 2036, 1524, 1666, 2383, 15, 5692, 81, 936, 391, 2793, 4, 8, 61, 1125, 27, 27, 771, 2, 194, 4, 339, 218, 410, 24, 10, 1351, 1100, 34, 91, 15, 3215, 155, 132, 99, 132, 104, 61, 817, 155, 2059, 489, 28, 3, 61, 1, 2036, 81, 2793, 88, 27, 121, 2949, 1809, 2059, 489, 28, 1524, 81, 2793, 88, 27, 613, 3, 96, 186, 290, 281, 4, 179, 1, 7, 63, 11, 613, 1218, 340, 4062, 1966, 4532, 1467, 559, 1172, 2923, 4636, 559, 2, 6546, 24, 1687, 93, 61, 470, 2153, 4, 554, 13634, 148, 2, 4, 3, 554, 13634, 6549, 197, 28, 62, 415, 2, 4, 62, 7, 1829, 2725, 400, 11, 164, 28, 415, 1, 16138, 81, 2793, 5, 493, 6, 424, 297, 1, 13741, 513, 2432, 3, 1280, 727, 242, 77, 461, 253, 11, 530, 585, 34, 3443, 20024, 244, 10, 164, 4, 67, 1, 653, 7, 132, 2130, 132, 36999, 10, 1228, 149, 421, 1856, 4207, 13634, 148, 2, 1687, 2725, 297, 1, 13741, 128, 28, 415, 1, 16138, 81, 2793, 94, 3103, 36999, 4, 150, 5, 127, 2555, 600, 32, 942, 70, 2459, 12, 1936, 382, 233, 78704, 846, 3194, 1630, 70]",,28053021,235
