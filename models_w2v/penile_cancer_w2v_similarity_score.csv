"Prostate carcinoma with testicular or penile metastases. Clinical, pathologic, and immunohistochemical features.",Cancer,Cancer,2002-05-01,"Despite the proximity, prostate carcinoma seldom metastasizes to the penis or testis. In the current study, the authors retrospectively examined the clinical history of 12 patients with prostate carcinoma and testicular or penile metastases. Pathologic review and immunohistochemical staining were performed on tumors from eight of these patients. Patients with prostate carcinoma and testicular or penile metastasis responded to androgen ablative therapy (median duration, 33 months). They were predisposed to developing persistent or recurrent urinary symptoms and visceral metastases. Six of 9 evaluable patients had elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels (> 6 ng/mL), whereas 2 of 10 patients had low or undetectable serum prostate specific antigen levels (< 4 ng/mL). In seven of the eight patients for whom specimens were available, the tumors were found to contain histologic features that were compatible with a diagnosis of ductal or endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Patients with prostate carcinoma and testicular or penile metastases have unique clinical and pathologic characteristics. Many of these patients' tumors are compatible with a subtype of prostate carcinoma known as ductal adenocarcinoma.

Advanced penile carcinoma.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2003-08-01,"In the United States penile carcinoma is an uncommon malignancy that represents only 0.4% of all male malignancies and 2% to 4% of genitourinary malignancies. Of penile cancer cases 30% are diagnosed with advanced disease. Improved understanding of the natural history, appropriate and accurate staging, and tailored, less morbid lymphadenectomy have led to improved survival and decreased the adverse effects of therapy. However, the management of advanced penile carcinoma remains a challenge to urological, medical and radiation oncologists. The rarity and paucity of well designed clinical studies of medical and/or surgical therapy for advanced penile cancer have hampered progress in the treatment of this disease. However, there is clear evidence that identifies active chemotherapy and radiation treatments. This review aims to provide the treating physician with an overview of available data for surgical, chemotherapeutic and radiation treatments, and provide guidelines for appropriate patient selection for these therapies. We performed a detailed review of the available literature regarding advanced penile carcinoma to include its etiology, epidemiology, natural history, staging classification and treatment. Penile carcinoma typically spreads along an echelon of nodal pathways that permits fairly accurate staging. Prognosis correlates well with clinical nodal status and grade, and the TNM classification developed by the UICC should be uniformly used by clinicians. Treatment recommendations are tightly associated with disease stage. Although tailored lymphadenectomy as currently recommended has greatly decreased morbidity, improved staging accuracy and improved treatment results, controversies still exist regarding the need for lymphadenectomy in patients with impalpable lymph node (cN0) disease, and the role and timing of pelvic lymphadenectomy. There is evidence of modest activity for chemotherapy in advanced penile carcinoma. Active agents include cisplatin, bleomycin and methotrexate. Combination chemotherapy regimens with promising activity and toxicity profiles include cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil, and vincristine, bleomycin and methotrexate. Radiation in combination with surgery and/or chemotherapy in advanced disease have also demonstrated activity. The natural history of penile carcinoma and its proclivity to spread via regional lymphatics has been well defined. This understanding has led to the development of effective locoregional treatment strategies. Penile carcinoma is sensitive to radiation and certain chemotherapeutic agents. A threshold volume of nodal metastases is associated with significant mortality. The optimal application of these strategies remains to be determined. Improvements in survival and quality of life likely require the incorporation of multiple modalities into the treatment of advanced penile carcinoma.

Cyclooxygenase-2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 are overexpressed in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2004-02-01,"Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) promotes malignant growth. Cyclooxygenase (COX) catalyzes the synthesis of PGH2, which is converted, in turn, by microsomal prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES-1) to PGE2. One strategy for inhibiting carcinogenesis is to prevent PGE2 production in premalignant and malignant tissues. It is important, therefore, to determine whether enzymes involved in PGE2 biosynthesis are deregulated in neoplasia. The main purpose of this study was to determine whether amounts of COX-2 or mPGES-1 were increased in intraepithelial neoplasia or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the penis. Because human papillomavirus (HPV) has been linked to the development of penile SCC, a secondary objective was to determine whether COX-2 was overexpressed in SCC arising in an HPV16 transgenic mouse. Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting were used to evaluate the expression of COX-2 and mPGES-1 in benign and malignant lesions including metastases to lymph nodes. Amounts of intratumoral PGE2 were quantified by enzyme immunoassay. Reverse transcription-PCR was used to determine the expression of each of the four known receptors (EP(1-4)) for PGE2. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased expression of COX-2 and mPGES-1 in dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, invasive SCC, and metastases to lymph nodes. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that COX-2 and mPGES-1 were consistently overexpressed in SCC. PGE2 and all four of the PGE2 receptor subtypes were detected in each of the tumor samples. Elevated levels of COX-2 were also detected in SCC arising in an HPV16 transgenic mouse. Increased amounts of COX-2 and mPGES-1 were detected in penile intraepithelial neoplasia and carcinoma. These findings provide the basis for evaluating whether inhibiting COX-2 will be useful in the prevention or treatment of penile SCC.",Journal Article,5833.0,77.0,Prostaglandin E2 PGE2 promotes malignant growth Cyclooxygenase COX catalyzes the synthesis of PGH2 which is converted in turn by microsomal prostaglandin E synthase mPGES-1 to PGE2 One strategy for inhibiting carcinogenesis is to prevent PGE2 production in premalignant and malignant tissues It is important therefore to determine whether enzymes involved in PGE2 biosynthesis are deregulated in neoplasia The main purpose of this study was to determine whether amounts of COX-2 or mPGES-1 were increased in intraepithelial neoplasia or squamous cell carcinoma SCC of the penis Because human papillomavirus HPV has been linked to the development of SCC a secondary objective was to determine whether COX-2 was overexpressed in SCC arising in an HPV16 transgenic mouse Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting were used to evaluate the expression of COX-2 and mPGES-1 in benign and malignant lesions including metastases to lymph nodes Amounts of intratumoral PGE2 were quantified by enzyme immunoassay Reverse transcription-PCR was used to determine the expression of each of the four known receptors EP 1-4 for PGE2 Immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased expression of COX-2 and mPGES-1 in dysplasia carcinoma in situ invasive SCC and metastases to lymph nodes Immunoblot analysis confirmed that COX-2 and mPGES-1 were consistently overexpressed in SCC PGE2 and all four of the PGE2 receptor subtypes were detected in each of the tumor samples Elevated levels of COX-2 were also detected in SCC arising in an HPV16 transgenic mouse Increased amounts of COX-2 and mPGES-1 were detected in intraepithelial neoplasia and carcinoma These findings provide the basis for evaluating whether inhibiting COX-2 will be useful in the prevention or treatment of SCC,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6068, 5036, 8874, 2148, 393, 129, 4043, 418, 11074, 3, 2525, 1, 54009, 92, 16, 4764, 4, 3854, 20, 27938, 6068, 563, 3522, 28188, 14, 6, 8874, 104, 692, 9, 2062, 1719, 16, 6, 1682, 8874, 1529, 4, 4343, 2, 393, 742, 192, 16, 305, 673, 6, 223, 317, 3039, 646, 4, 8874, 6225, 32, 5415, 4, 2298, 3, 1895, 743, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 223, 317, 4939, 1, 418, 18, 15, 28188, 14, 11, 101, 4, 4153, 2298, 15, 691, 31, 134, 1791, 1, 3, 10954, 408, 171, 3242, 933, 71, 85, 1199, 6, 3, 193, 1, 1791, 8, 568, 461, 10, 6, 223, 317, 418, 18, 10, 1711, 4, 1791, 2635, 4, 35, 4048, 2862, 830, 888, 2, 5293, 11, 95, 6, 376, 3, 55, 1, 418, 18, 2, 28188, 14, 4, 1002, 2, 393, 406, 141, 196, 6, 263, 502, 4939, 1, 2074, 8874, 11, 2790, 20, 1644, 9006, 1772, 866, 604, 10, 95, 6, 223, 3, 55, 1, 296, 1, 3, 294, 440, 1186, 4921, 14, 39, 9, 8874, 888, 264, 101, 55, 1, 418, 18, 2, 28188, 14, 4, 2253, 134, 4, 957, 416, 1791, 2, 196, 6, 263, 502, 7625, 65, 557, 17, 418, 18, 2, 28188, 14, 11, 2433, 1711, 4, 1791, 8874, 2, 62, 294, 1, 3, 8874, 153, 814, 11, 530, 4, 296, 1, 3, 30, 347, 804, 148, 1, 418, 18, 11, 120, 530, 4, 1791, 2635, 4, 35, 4048, 2862, 830, 101, 4939, 1, 418, 18, 2, 28188, 14, 11, 530, 4, 4153, 2298, 2, 134, 46, 272, 377, 3, 877, 9, 1435, 317, 2062, 418, 18, 303, 40, 999, 4, 3, 1070, 15, 24, 1, 1791]",1758.0,14871981,2

We report use and treatment outcomes in a 5-year interval in a population based cohort from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study. A sample of 1,977 men with localized prostate cancer who received external beam radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy in 1994 to 1995 were surveyed for 5 outcome measures of ED treatment, namely treatment, perceived helpfulness, erectile sufficiency, sexual activity frequency and erection maintenance. Subjects were surveyed 6, 12, 24 and 60 months after prostate cancer diagnosis. Overall 50.5% of men ever used ED treatment. The use of ED treatments increased during the study course. Subject age, regular sexual partner and baseline sexual activity were factors positively associated with ED treatments. While it was used uncommonly (1.9%), a penile prosthesis was perceived as the most helpful ED treatment (helped a lot in 52% of respondents). Sildenafil helped a lot in 12% of respondents.

Multimodality therapy in penile cancer: when and which treatments?,World journal of urology,World J Urol,2008-08-06,"Metastatic penile cancer typically comes to attention while the clinical extent of disease is limited to the inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes. Primary surgical management of lymph node metastases achieves tumor control and long-term survival for only a small percentage of these patients. To determine the optimal use of multimodality treatment in locally advanced penile cancer, we conducted a literature review. Relevant English-language literature was identified with the use of Medline; additional cited works not detected on the initial search were also reviewed. There is an emerging strategy of preoperative (neoadjuvant) combination chemotherapy to improve the progression-free survival of penile cancer patients with bulky regional lymph node metastases. Radiotherapy for inguinal metastases and postoperative (adjuvant) radiation for selected patients has also been effective in this setting. In patients with lymph node metastases, the benefit of ilioinguinal lymphadenectomy may be extended by the addition of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Recovery of erectile function after radical prostatectomy is quantitatively related to the response to intraoperative cavernous nerve stimulation.,BJU international,BJU Int.,2009-03-30,"To correlate the results of intraoperative cavernous nerve stimulation (CaNS) at radical prostatectomy (RP), with preoperative erectile function (EF) and to determine the significance of the results of stimulation after RP in predicting the recovery of EF. The study included 183 potent men who had not received neoadjuvant therapy, and who had RP without nerve grafting, with intraoperative CaNS, between July 1998 and April 2002. Follow-up International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaires were returned at a median (range) of 25 (1-51) months. Age, preoperative EF, neurovascular bundle (NVB) status, pathological stage and CaNS results were evaluated as independent predictors of the recovery of EF, as assessed by the IIEF, using Cox proportional hazards analysis. CaNS strength before RP correlated with the level of preoperative potency (P = 0.023). CaNS strength after RP correlated with that before RP (P < 0.001) and the degree of NVB preservation (P = 0.007). Only age and maximum percentage change in penile girth after RP were significant independent predictors of the recovery of EF. For each 1-year increase in age, men were 4%, 6% and 5% less likely to achieve erections, defined as an IIEF EF domain score of >or=17, >or=22 and >or=26, respectively.

Association between lymph node density and disease specific survival in patients with penile cancer.,The Journal of urology,J.

Data were collected retrospectively in 75 and prospectively in 88 consecutive patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis treated at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1979 and 2007. We identified 45 patients with penile cancer and nodal metastasis who underwent lymphadenectomy with curative intent. Lymph node density was analyzed as a categorical variable by grouping patients into 2 or 3 categories based on equal percents. We explored the prognostic value of lymph node density for predicting disease specific survival in this cohort. Median followup was 23.7 months in all patients. By the time of analysis 22 patients had died, including 18 (82%) of penile cancer and 4 (18%) of other causes.

"Extensive inguinal lymphadenectomy improves overall 5-year survival in penile cancer patients: results from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program.",Cancer,Cancer,2010-06-01,"European Urological Association guidelines recommend potentially curative inguinal lymphadenectomy for certain cases of penile cancer such as grade 3 and pT2-4 lesions, among others. Anecdotally, the authors have noticed that few patients undergo inguinal lymphadenectomy. Therefore, they assessed the frequency of inguinal lymphadenectomy and the impact of dissection extent on survival using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The authors queried 17 SEER registries from 1988 through 2005 for grade 3 and pT2-4 penile cancer patients without distant metastases. Univariate and multivariate analyses examined predictors of inguinal lymphadenectomy. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses assessed overall 5-year survival across patient- and disease-related characteristics for patients receiving inguinal lymphadenectomy involving <8 or > or = 8 lymph nodes, the latter a surrogate for extent of dissection based on other malignancies. Of 593 patients enrolled, only 26.5% received inguinal lymphadenectomy. In addition to grade 3 (P = .031) and pT2-4 disease (P = .004), age <65 years (P < .001) and marital status (P = .002) were significantly associated with receiving lymph node dissection. Increased overall 5-year survival (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-0.79) was observed in patients of all ages who received lymphadenectomy involving > or = 8 lymph nodes.

A multimodal approach to treatment is desirable for such patients. We performed a phase II study of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the objective of determining the response rate, time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS) among patients with bulky adenopathy. Eligible patients had stage N2 or N3 (stage III or stage IV) penile cancer without distant metastases. Neoadjuvant treatment (four courses every 3-4 weeks) consisted of paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) administered over 3 hours on day 1; ifosfamide 1,200 mg/m(2) on days 1 to 3; and cisplatin 25 mg/m(2) on days 1 to 3. Clinical and pathologic responses were assessed, and patient groups were compared for TTP and OS. Thirty men received chemotherapy of whom 15 (50.0%) had an objective response and 22 (73.3%) subsequently underwent surgery. Three patients had no remaining tumor on histopathology. Nine patients (30.0%) remained alive and free of recurrence (median follow-up, 34 months; range, 14-59 months), and two patients died of other causes without recurrence. Improved TTP and OS were significantly associated with a response to chemotherapy (P < .001 and P = .001, respectively), absence of bilateral residual tumor (P = .002 and P = .017, respectively), and absence of extranodal extension (P = .001 and P = .004, respectively) or skin involvement (P = .009 and P = .012, respectively).

Subjects were 129 men with prostate cancer with I-125 seed implants (prescribed dose, 145 Gy) without supplemental hormonal or external beam radiation therapy. Sexual function, potency, and bother were prospectively assessed at baseline and at 1, 4, 8, and 12 months using validated quality-of-life self-assessment surveys. Postimplant dosimetry values, including dose to 10% of the penile bulb (D10), D20, D33, D50, D75, D90, and penile volume receiving 100% of the prescribed dose (V100) were calculated. At baseline, 56% of patients recorded having optimal erections; at 1 year, 62% of patients with baseline erectile function maintained optimal potency, 58% of whom with medically prescribed sexual aids or drugs. Variables associated with pretreatment-to-posttreatment decline in potency were time after implant (p = 0.04) and age (p = 0.01). Decline in urinary function may have been related to decline in potency. At 1 year, 69% of potent patients younger than 70 years maintained optimal potency, whereas 31% of patients older than 70 maintained optimal potency (p = 0.02). Diabetes was related to a decline in potency (p = 0.05), but neither smoking nor hypertension were.

"The antioxidant, MnTE-2-PyP, prevents side-effects incurred by prostate cancer irradiation.",PloS one,PLoS ONE,2012-09-12,"Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 240,000 new cases reported annually in the United States. Due to early detection and advances in therapies, more than 90% of patients will survive 10 years post diagnosis and treatment. Radiation is a treatment option often used to treat localized disease; however, while radiation is very effective at killing tumor cells, normal tissues are damaged as well. Potential side-effects due to prostate cancer-related radiation therapy include bowel inflammation, erectile dysfunction, urethral stricture, rectal bleeding and incontinence. Currently, radiation therapy for prostate cancer does not include the administration of therapeutic agents to reduce these side effects and protect normal tissues from radiation-induced damage. In the current study, we show that the small molecular weight antioxidant, MnTE-2-PyP, protects normal tissues from radiation-induced damage in the lower abdomen in rats. Specifically, MnTE-2-PyP protected skin, prostate, and testes from radiation-induced damage. MnTE-2-PyP also protected from erectile dysfunction, a persistent problem regardless of the type of radiation techniques used because the penile neurovascular bundles lay in the peripheral zones of the prostate, where most prostate cancers reside. Based on previous studies showing that MnTE-2-PyP, in combination with radiation, further reduces subcutaneous tumor growth, we believe that MnTE-2-PyP represents an excellent radioprotectant in combination radiotherapy for cancer in general and specifically for prostate cancer.",Journal Article,2687.0,24.0,"cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer with an estimated 240,000 new cases reported annually in the United States Due to early detection and advances in therapies more than 90 of patients will survive 10 years post diagnosis and treatment Radiation is a treatment option often used to treat localized disease however while radiation is very effective at killing tumor cells normal tissues are damaged as well Potential side-effects due to cancer-related radiation therapy include bowel inflammation erectile dysfunction stricture bleeding and incontinence Currently radiation therapy for cancer does not include the administration of therapeutic agents to reduce these side effects and protect normal tissues from radiation-induced damage In the current study we show that the small molecular weight antioxidant MnTE-2-PyP protects normal tissues from radiation-induced damage in the lower abdomen in rats Specifically MnTE-2-PyP protected and testes from radiation-induced damage MnTE-2-PyP also protected from erectile dysfunction a persistent problem regardless of the type of radiation techniques used because the neurovascular bundles lay in the peripheral zones of the where most cancers reside Based on previous studies showing that MnTE-2-PyP in combination with radiation further reduces subcutaneous tumor growth we believe that MnTE-2-PyP represents an excellent radioprotectant in combination radiotherapy for cancer in general and specifically for cancer",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[12, 16, 3, 96, 841, 265, 12, 5, 35, 661, 4263, 984, 217, 140, 210, 4226, 4, 3, 1088, 907, 520, 6, 191, 638, 2, 954, 4, 235, 80, 76, 424, 1, 7, 303, 4573, 79, 60, 539, 147, 2, 24, 121, 16, 8, 24, 1501, 629, 95, 6, 943, 909, 34, 137, 369, 121, 16, 923, 323, 28, 3003, 30, 37, 295, 742, 32, 9884, 22, 149, 174, 1152, 176, 520, 6, 12, 139, 121, 36, 643, 1659, 1815, 5186, 1527, 6673, 2294, 2, 6152, 694, 121, 36, 9, 12, 1097, 44, 643, 3, 634, 1, 189, 183, 6, 969, 46, 1152, 176, 2, 4869, 295, 742, 29, 121, 277, 1350, 4, 3, 291, 45, 21, 514, 17, 3, 302, 219, 924, 5536, 32022, 18, 32023, 8170, 295, 742, 29, 121, 277, 1350, 4, 3, 280, 4036, 4, 3765, 1225, 32022, 18, 32023, 5541, 2, 13100, 29, 121, 277, 1350, 32022, 18, 32023, 120, 5541, 29, 5186, 1527, 8, 1882, 2497, 1583, 1, 3, 267, 1, 121, 1092, 95, 408, 3, 9848, 16206, 9455, 4, 3, 672, 13814, 1, 3, 1257, 96, 163, 10114, 90, 23, 698, 94, 2069, 17, 32022, 18, 32023, 4, 150, 5, 121, 195, 2389, 2529, 30, 129, 21, 4629, 17, 32022, 18, 32023, 1449, 35, 1503, 47400, 4, 150, 310, 9, 12, 4, 1083, 2, 1225, 9, 12]",1473.0,22984473,51

There is pre-clinical evidence supporting the use of angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) for this purpose, although this has not been studied in humans. The present study shows that there may be a benefit in the recovery of EF post-RRP in patients taking a daily dose of irbesartan, an ARB, following RRP. In addition, the use of irbesartan may curb the loss of stretched penile length which occurs postoperatively. Further study in the form of prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials are necessary to confirm these findings. • To evaluate retrospectively the potential benefit of administering irbesartan, an angiotensin-receptor blocker, to improve erectile function (EF) recovery after nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP). • Before surgery potent patients who underwent nerve-sparing RRP between April and December 2009 elected to start daily oral irbesartan 300 mg on postoperative day 1 (n= 17). A contemporaneously clinically matched cohort consisting of patients who declined irbesartan use served as the control group (n= 12). • Postoperative 'on demand' use of erectile aids (phosphodiesterase type 5 [PDE5] inhibitors and intracavernous injections) was adopted. • Potency was monitored by the administration of International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) questionnaires before surgery and at early (3 months) and long-term (12 and 24 months) postoperative intervals. • Stretched penile length (SPL) was measured both immediately and 3 months after surgery. • EF status was no different between groups at baseline (P > 0.05). • While the IIEF-5 scores at 24 months after surgery were statistically similar between the two groups (control = 15.2 ± 2.0, irbesartan = 14.1 ± 3.1, P = 0.77), at 12 months the IIEF-5 scores of the irbesartan group were significantly higher than those of the control group (14 ± 2.6 vs. 7.2 ± 1.6, P < 0.05). • The proportional loss of SPL after RRP was less in the irbesartan than in the control group at 3 months (-0.9 ± 1.5% vs -5.6 ± 1.5, P < 0.05). • Regular irbesartan use after nerve-sparing RRP in patients with normal preoperative erectile function could improve EF recovery after surgery and mitigate early loss of SPL.",Journal Article,2853.0,8.0,Study Type -- Therapy retrospective cohort Level of

Radical cystectomy in patients with preexisting three-piece inflatable penile prosthesis.,The journal of sexual medicine,J Sex Med,2012-10-22,"Radical cystectomy with urinary diversion is the treatment of choice for muscle-invasive, and certain populations with non-invasive, urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. There have not been any reports to date on patients undergoing this surgery who have had previous placement of an inflatable penile prosthesis. To present the outcomes of four patients with pre-existing inflatable penile prostheses (IPP) with reservoirs within the space of Retzius who were subsequently treated with radical cystectomy for bladder cancer management. After obtaining institutional review board approval, the demographic, clinical, and pathologic data were reviewed in the Johns Hopkins Cystectomy Database for patients who underwent radical cystectomy for bladder cancer from 1994 to 2012. A case series of four patients is presented who had a preexisting IPP and their post-operative course and long-term outcomes are reviewed. All four patients had radical cystectomy and ileal conduit urinary diversion with no intra-operative or post-operative complications. One patient was not sexually active and therefore had the reservoir explanted and not replaced. The other three patients had the reservoir removed prior to bladder extirpation and the tubing capped, with reservoir replacement in the pseudocapsule at the termination of the procedure. In one patient an omental flap was used to ensure separation between the reservoir and ileal conduit. The devices were all functional intra-operatively and on follow-up. As erectile dysfunction is more commonly being diagnosed and treated with IPP insertion at younger ages, surgeons will increasingly encounter pre-placed abdominal reservoirs when performing pelvic surgery. This case series of four patients undergoing radical cystectomy with prior-placed IPPs reveals that the functionality of the IPP can be preserved while still performing oncologically sound extirpative procedures.",Case Reports,2647.0,0.0,Radical cystectomy with urinary diversion is the treatment of choice for muscle-invasive and certain populations with non-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the There have not been any reports to date on patients undergoing this surgery who have had previous placement of an inflatable prosthesis To present the outcomes of four patients with pre-existing inflatable prostheses IPP with reservoirs within the space of Retzius who were subsequently treated with radical cystectomy for cancer management After obtaining institutional review board approval the demographic clinical and pathologic data were reviewed in the Johns Hopkins Cystectomy Database for patients who underwent radical cystectomy for cancer from 1994 to 2012 A case series of four patients is presented who had a preexisting IPP and their post-operative course and long-term outcomes are reviewed All four patients had radical cystectomy and ileal conduit urinary diversion with no intra-operative or post-operative complications One patient was not sexually active and therefore had the reservoir explanted and not replaced The other three patients had the reservoir removed prior to extirpation and the tubing capped with reservoir replacement in the pseudocapsule at the termination of the procedure In one patient an omental flap was used to ensure separation between the reservoir and ileal conduit The devices were all functional intra-operatively and on follow-up As erectile dysfunction is more commonly being diagnosed and treated with IPP insertion at younger ages surgeons will increasingly encounter pre-placed abdominal reservoirs when performing pelvic surgery This case series of four patients undergoing radical cystectomy with prior-placed IPPs reveals that the functionality of the IPP can be preserved while still performing oncologically sound extirpative procedures,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[711, 1750, 5, 1660, 6067, 16, 3, 24, 1, 1866, 9, 1502, 416, 2, 1840, 1184, 5, 220, 416, 1472, 134, 1, 3, 125, 47, 44, 85, 500, 1198, 6, 1244, 23, 7, 479, 26, 152, 54, 47, 42, 698, 2613, 1, 35, 40147, 13937, 6, 364, 3, 123, 1, 294, 7, 5, 671, 1692, 40147, 23639, 30622, 5, 17087, 262, 3, 3865, 1, 47460, 54, 11, 1611, 73, 5, 711, 1750, 9, 12, 284, 50, 5244, 1115, 206, 2620, 1814, 3, 1540, 38, 2, 510, 74, 11, 446, 4, 3, 5848, 5569, 1750, 609, 9, 7, 54, 208, 711, 1750, 9, 12, 29, 3023, 6, 1195, 8, 473, 988, 1, 294, 7, 16, 917, 54, 42, 8, 5004, 30622, 2, 136, 539, 1208, 906, 2, 319, 337, 123, 32, 446, 62, 294, 7, 42, 711, 1750, 2, 9185, 10439, 1660, 6067, 5, 77, 2392, 1208, 15, 539, 1208, 521, 104, 69, 10, 44, 13588, 544, 2, 673, 42, 3, 10470, 22218, 2, 44, 6928, 3, 127, 169, 7, 42, 3, 10470, 2264, 324, 6, 11945, 2, 3, 32039, 19785, 5, 10470, 3892, 4, 3, 19315, 28, 3, 7202, 1, 3, 1299, 4, 104, 69, 35, 11404, 3942, 10, 95, 6, 3478, 5422, 59, 3, 10470, 2, 9185, 10439, 3, 6497, 11, 62, 583, 2392, 9433, 2, 23, 166, 126, 22, 5186, 1527, 16, 80, 841, 486, 265, 2, 73, 5, 30622, 5099, 28, 773, 2165, 1613, 303, 1635, 8650, 671, 3295, 1467, 17087, 198, 3620, 1110, 152, 26, 473, 988, 1, 294, 7, 479, 711, 1750, 5, 324, 3295, 62043, 4054, 17, 3, 8592, 1, 3, 30622, 122, 40, 5797, 369, 1234, 3620, 10854, 11475, 13349, 1369]",1854.0,23088759,39

"Reduced penile size and treatment regret in men with recurrent prostate cancer after surgery, radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation, or radiotherapy alone.",Urology,Urology,2013-01-01,"To report the relative incidence of the perceived reduction in penile size across prostate cancer treatment modalities and to describe its effect on quality of life and treatment regret. The incidence of patient complaints about reduced penile size was calculated for 948 men in the Comprehensive, Observational, Multicenter, Prostate Adenocarcinoma (COMPARE) registry who experienced biochemical failure (per registry definition) and were assessed a median of 5.53 years after prostatectomy or radiotherapy (RT) consisting of either external beam RT or brachytherapy, with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with treatment regret and interference with emotional relationships. Of 948 men, 25 (2.63%) complained of a reduced penile size. The incidence of reduced penile size stratified by treatment was 3.73% for surgery (19 of 510), 2.67% for RT plus ADT (6 of 225), and 0% for RT without ADT (0 of 213). The surgery (P=.004) and RT plus ADT (P=.016) groups had significantly more shortened penis complaints than the RT alone group. The rate of a shortened penis after surgery and after RT plus ADT was similar (P=.47).

Phase 1 prospective evaluation of the oncological adequacy of robotic assisted video-endoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomy in patients with penile carcinoma.,BJU international,BJU Int.,2013-04-02,"WHAT'S KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT? AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Several lymph node staging strategies have been proposed as a response to the high morbidity seen after standard inguinal lymphadenectomy for penile cancer. A video-endoscopic (laparoscopic and robotic) approach has been proposed as a less morbid procedure in several retrospective studies. To date, none has evaluated the oncological adequacy with regard to whether all relevant nodes have been removed. To the authors' knowledge this is the first prospective study of a robotic or laparoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomy that evaluates the oncological adequacy of this approach for penile cancer. The study shows that robotic inguinal lymphadenectomy allowed adequate staging of disease in the inguinal region by removing all relevant lymph nodes as assessed by an independent evaluating urological oncologist. To prospectively determine the oncological adequacy of robotic assisted video-endoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomy (RAVEIL). Patients with T1-3N0 penile cancer were enrolled into a prospective phase I trial at a tertiary care institution from March 2010 to January 2012. All patients underwent an initial RAVEIL approach. Verification of adequacy of dissection was performed by an independent surgeon via a separate open incision at the conclusion of the RAVEIL procedure. Out of 10 patients, if more than two superficial inguinal fields with ≥2 nodes or more than four with ≥1 node remained within the superficial dissection field, the study would not proceed to phase II. Of 10 enrolled patients two had inguinal metastases and all positive nodes were detected by RAVEIL. The remaining eight patients had no metastases, with a mean of nine (range 5-21) left and nine (range 6-17) right nodes removed. One inguinal field RAVEIL was converted to an open dissection. The verifying surgeon confirmed that 18 of 19 inguinal fields (94.7% in nine patients) had an adequate dissection. Two benign nodes were found just beneath Scarpa's fascia above the inguinal dissection field. Limitations of the study include an inability to determine decisively what specific wound complications were related to RAVEIL because of the protocol-specified creation of a small inguinal incision for verification of adequate dissection. RAVEIL allowed adequate staging of disease in the inguinal region among patients with penile cancer at risk for inguinal metastases.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",2485.0,42.0,WHAT 'S KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD Several lymph node staging strategies have been proposed as a response to the high morbidity seen after standard inguinal lymphadenectomy for cancer A video-endoscopic laparoscopic and robotic approach has been proposed as a less morbid procedure in several retrospective studies To date none has evaluated the oncological adequacy with regard to whether all relevant nodes have been removed To the authors knowledge this is the first prospective study of a robotic or laparoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomy that evaluates the oncological adequacy of this approach for cancer The study shows that robotic inguinal lymphadenectomy allowed adequate staging of disease in the inguinal region by removing all relevant lymph nodes as assessed by an independent evaluating urological oncologist To prospectively determine the oncological adequacy of robotic assisted video-endoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomy RAVEIL Patients with T1-3N0 cancer were enrolled into a prospective phase I trial at a tertiary care institution from March 2010 to January 2012 All patients underwent an initial RAVEIL approach Verification of adequacy of dissection was performed by an independent surgeon via a separate open incision at the conclusion of the RAVEIL procedure Out of 10 patients if more than two superficial inguinal fields with ≥2 nodes or more than four with ≥1 node remained within the superficial dissection field the study would not proceed to phase II Of 10 enrolled patients two had inguinal metastases and all positive nodes were detected by RAVEIL The remaining eight patients had no metastases with a mean of nine range 5-21 left and nine range 6-17 right nodes removed One inguinal field RAVEIL was converted to an open dissection The verifying surgeon confirmed that 18 of 19 inguinal fields 94.7 in nine patients had an adequate dissection Two benign nodes were found just beneath Scarpa 's fascia above the inguinal dissection field Limitations of the study include an inability to determine decisively what specific wound complications were related to RAVEIL because of the protocol-specified creation of a small inguinal incision for verification of adequate dissection RAVEIL allowed adequate staging of disease in the inguinal region among patients with cancer at risk for inguinal metastases,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2067, 292, 440, 23, 3, 2974, 2, 2067, 1097, 3, 45, 4178, 392, 263, 289, 632, 422, 47, 85, 1587, 22, 8, 51, 6, 3, 64, 787, 527, 50, 260, 4907, 2048, 9, 12, 8, 4139, 2056, 1964, 2, 2895, 353, 71, 85, 1587, 22, 8, 299, 8188, 1299, 4, 392, 459, 94, 6, 1244, 1292, 71, 194, 3, 5378, 6760, 5, 2539, 6, 317, 62, 867, 502, 47, 85, 2264, 6, 3, 738, 922, 26, 16, 3, 157, 482, 45, 1, 8, 2895, 15, 1964, 4907, 2048, 17, 4941, 3, 5378, 6760, 1, 26, 353, 9, 12, 3, 45, 1949, 17, 2895, 4907, 2048, 2313, 1658, 632, 1, 34, 4, 3, 4907, 1053, 20, 9026, 62, 867, 263, 502, 22, 275, 20, 35, 306, 1435, 7721, 2709, 6, 1143, 223, 3, 5378, 6760, 1, 2895, 2927, 4139, 2056, 4907, 2048, 27271, 7, 5, 1534, 22216, 12, 11, 346, 237, 8, 482, 124, 70, 160, 28, 8, 2557, 165, 731, 29, 2363, 1120, 6, 1024, 1195, 62, 7, 208, 35, 388, 27271, 353, 6720, 1, 6760, 1, 1161, 10, 173, 20, 35, 306, 1897, 847, 8, 2282, 1020, 7538, 28, 3, 1221, 1, 3, 27271, 1299, 1205, 1, 79, 7, 492, 80, 76, 100, 3562, 4907, 3130, 5, 3107, 502, 15, 80, 76, 294, 5, 3567, 289, 958, 262, 3, 3562, 1161, 1067, 3, 45, 688, 44, 6174, 6, 124, 215, 1, 79, 346, 7, 100, 42, 4907, 196, 2, 62, 109, 502, 11, 530, 20, 27271, 3, 1844, 659, 7, 42, 77, 196, 5, 8, 313, 1, 762, 184, 33, 239, 1712, 2, 762, 184, 49, 269, 1913, 502, 2264, 104, 4907, 1067, 27271, 10, 4764, 6, 35, 1020, 1161, 3, 24489, 1897, 557, 17, 203, 1, 326, 4907, 3130, 960, 67, 4, 762, 7, 42, 35, 1658, 1161, 100, 1002, 502, 11, 204, 4673, 17080, 62674, 292, 14389, 2090, 3, 4907, 1161, 1067, 1939, 1, 3, 45, 643, 35, 4985, 6, 223, 47689, 2067, 112, 2689, 521, 11, 139, 6, 27271, 408, 1, 3, 1182, 3575, 7560, 1, 8, 302, 4907, 7538, 9, 6720, 1, 1658, 1161, 27271, 2313, 1658, 632, 1, 34, 4, 3, 4907, 1053, 107, 7, 5, 12, 28, 43, 9, 4907, 196]",2354.0,23551693,27

This often-aggressive tumor phenotype has been characterized by its poor prognosis, mostly attributable to its late presentation and heterogeneity of surgical care because of the paucity of cases treated at most centers. Recent advances in understanding of the risk factors predisposing to penile cancer, including its association with the human papilloma virus (HPV), have brought forth the socioepidemiologic concept of HPV vaccination in certain high-risk populations and countries, which remains highly debated. The management of penile cancer has evolved in recent years with the adoption of penile-sparing and minimally invasive surgical approaches to the inguinal lymph nodes, which are a frequent site of regional spread for this malignancy.

Cytosolic phosphorylated EGFR is predictive of recurrence in early stage penile cancer patients: a retropective study.,Journal of translational medicine,J Transl Med,2013-07-02,"Penile cancer (PC) is a rare tumor, and therapeutic options are limited for this disease, with an overall 5-year overall survival around 65-70%. Adjuvant therapy is not recommended for patients with N0-1 disease, despite up to 60% of these patients will die within 5 years from diagnosis. Medical records of all patients who underwent radical surgery at University Federico II of Naples and at National Tumor Institute ""Pascale"" of Naples for early squamous cell carcinoma of the penis from January, 2000 to December, 2011 were retrieved. Paraffin wax embedded tissue specimens were retrieved from the pathology archives of the participating Institutions for all patients. Expression of p-EGFR, EGFR and positivity to HPV were evaluated along with other histological variables of interest. Demographic data of eligible patients were retrieved along with clinical characteristics such as type of surgical operation, time of follow up, time of recurrence, overall survival. A multivariable model was constructed using a forward stepwise selection procedure. Thirty eligible patients were identified. All patients were positive for EGFR by immunohistochemistry, while 13 and 16 were respectively positive for nuclear and cytosolic p-EGFR. No EGFR amplification was detected by FISH. Eight patients were positive for high-risk HPV by ISH. On univariable analysis, corpora cavernosa infiltration (OR 7.8; 95% CI=0,8 to 75,6; P=0,039) and positivity for cytosolic p-EGFR (OR 7.6; 95% CI =1.49 to 50; P = 0.009) were predictive for recurrence, while only positivity for cytosolic p-EGFR (HR =9.0; 95% CI 1.0-100; P=0,0116) was prognostic for poor survival. It is of primary importance to identify patients with N0-1 disease who are at increased risk of recurrence, as they do not normally receive any adjuvant therapy.

Nightly vs on-demand sildenafil for penile rehabilitation after minimally invasive nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy: results of a randomized double-blind trial with placebo.,BJU international,BJU Int.,2013-08-13,"To clarify the role of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors in post-prostatectomy penile rehabilitation (PPPR). To compare nightly and on-demand use of PDE5 inhibitors after nerve-sparing minimally invasive radical prostatectomy (RP). We conducted a single-institution, double-blind, randomized controlled trial of nightly vs on-demand 50-mg sildenafil citrate after nerve-sparing minimally invasive RP. A total of 100 preoperatively potent men, aged <65 years, with scores on the Erectile Function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) ≥26, underwent nerve-sparing surgery. The patients were randomized to either nightly sildenafil and on-demand placebo (nightly sildenafil group), or on-demand sildenafil and nightly placebo (on-demand sildenafil group; maximum on-demand dose six tablets/month) for 12 months. Patients then underwent a 1-month washout period. Validated measures of erectile function (IIEF-EF score and the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite [EPIC]) were compared between treatment groups over the entire 13-month time course, using multivariable mixed linear regression models. The treatment groups were well matched preoperatively (mean age 54.3 vs 54.6 years, baseline IIEF-EF score 29.4 vs 29.3, for the nightly vs the on-demand sildenafil groups, respectively). No significant differences were found in erectile function between treatments (nightly vs on-demand sildenafil) at any single timepoint after RP, after adjusting for potential confounding factors. When evaluated over all timepoints simultaneously, no significant effects of treatment group (nightly vs on-demand sildenafil) were found on recovery of potency, as assessed by absolute IIEF-EF scores (P = 0.765), on percentage of men returning to an IIEF-EF score >21 (P = 0.830), or on IIEF-EF score recovery to a percentage of baseline value (P = 0.778). When evaluated over all timepoints simultaneously, no significant effects of treatment group were found on secondary endpoints such as assessment of potency (including EPIC item 59 response 'erections firm enough for intercourse'), attempted intercourse frequency or confidence. Erectile recovery up to 1 year after RP does not differ between previously potent men who use sildenafil nightly compared to on-demand. This trial does not support chronic nightly sildenafil as being any better than on-demand sildenafil for use in penile rehabilitation after nerve-sparing minimally invasive RP.",Comparative Study,2352.0,55.0,To clarify the role of phosphodiesterase type 5 PDE5 inhibitors in post-prostatectomy rehabilitation PPPR To compare nightly and on-demand use of PDE5 inhibitors after nerve-sparing minimally invasive radical prostatectomy RP We conducted a single-institution double-blind randomized controlled trial of nightly vs on-demand 50-mg sildenafil citrate after nerve-sparing minimally invasive RP A total of 100 preoperatively potent men aged 65 years with scores on the Erectile Function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function IIEF-EF ≥26 underwent nerve-sparing surgery The patients were randomized to either nightly sildenafil and on-demand placebo nightly sildenafil group or on-demand sildenafil and nightly placebo on-demand sildenafil group maximum on-demand dose six tablets/month for 12 months Patients then underwent a 1-month washout period Validated measures of erectile function IIEF-EF score and the Expanded Cancer Index Composite EPIC were compared between treatment groups over the entire 13-month time course using multivariable mixed linear regression models The treatment groups were well matched preoperatively mean age 54.3 vs 54.6 years baseline IIEF-EF score 29.4 vs 29.3 for the nightly vs the on-demand sildenafil groups respectively No significant differences were found in erectile function between treatments nightly vs on-demand sildenafil at any single timepoint after RP after adjusting for potential confounding factors When evaluated over all timepoints simultaneously no significant effects of treatment group nightly vs on-demand sildenafil were found on recovery of potency as assessed by absolute IIEF-EF scores P 0.765 on percentage of men returning to an IIEF-EF score 21 P 0.830 or on IIEF-EF score recovery to a percentage of baseline value P 0.778 When evaluated over all timepoints simultaneously no significant effects of treatment group were found on secondary endpoints such as assessment of potency including EPIC item 59 response 'erections firm enough for intercourse attempted intercourse frequency or confidence Erectile recovery up to 1 year after RP does not differ between previously potent men who use sildenafil nightly compared to on-demand This trial does not support chronic nightly sildenafil as being any better than on-demand sildenafil for use in rehabilitation after nerve-sparing minimally invasive RP,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 3968, 3, 200, 1, 11624, 267, 33, 10755, 222, 4, 539, 1202, 4182, 63214, 6, 932, 22801, 2, 23, 6645, 119, 1, 10755, 222, 50, 2476, 1851, 2144, 416, 711, 1202, 1622, 21, 426, 8, 226, 731, 1627, 3142, 384, 1149, 160, 1, 22801, 105, 23, 6645, 212, 81, 12872, 13274, 50, 2476, 1851, 2144, 416, 1622, 8, 181, 1, 394, 3888, 1157, 325, 1032, 556, 60, 5, 703, 23, 3, 5186, 343, 1398, 1, 3, 944, 558, 1, 5186, 343, 13174, 5580, 32162, 208, 2476, 1851, 152, 3, 7, 11, 384, 6, 361, 22801, 12872, 2, 23, 6645, 619, 22801, 12872, 87, 15, 23, 6645, 12872, 2, 22801, 619, 23, 6645, 12872, 87, 689, 23, 6645, 61, 437, 6675, 811, 9, 133, 53, 7, 818, 208, 8, 14, 811, 9897, 727, 938, 1018, 1, 5186, 343, 13174, 5580, 368, 2, 3, 2064, 12, 558, 3308, 8995, 11, 72, 59, 24, 271, 252, 3, 1797, 233, 811, 98, 906, 75, 658, 1739, 1646, 320, 274, 3, 24, 271, 11, 149, 655, 3888, 313, 89, 667, 27, 105, 667, 49, 60, 330, 13174, 5580, 368, 462, 39, 105, 462, 27, 9, 3, 22801, 105, 3, 23, 6645, 12872, 271, 106, 77, 93, 362, 11, 204, 4, 5186, 343, 59, 640, 22801, 105, 23, 6645, 12872, 28, 500, 226, 21439, 50, 1622, 50, 1358, 9, 174, 4339, 130, 198, 194, 252, 62, 14579, 3074, 77, 93, 176, 1, 24, 87, 22801, 105, 23, 6645, 12872, 11, 204, 23, 1602, 1, 3593, 22, 275, 20, 1766, 13174, 5580, 703, 19, 13, 12263, 23, 1150, 1, 325, 17207, 6, 35, 13174, 5580, 368, 239, 19, 13, 12400, 15, 23, 13174, 5580, 368, 1602, 6, 8, 1150, 1, 330, 549, 19, 13, 11751, 198, 194, 252, 62, 14579, 3074, 77, 93, 176, 1, 24, 87, 11, 204, 23, 568, 1387, 225, 22, 455, 1, 3593, 141, 8995, 3471, 728, 51, 63215, 10851, 5151, 9, 12361, 4098, 12361, 675, 15, 307, 5186, 1602, 126, 6, 14, 111, 50, 1622, 1097, 44, 1505, 59, 373, 1157, 325, 54, 119, 12872, 22801, 72, 6, 23, 6645, 26, 160, 1097, 44, 538, 442, 22801, 12872, 22, 486, 500, 380, 76, 23, 6645, 12872, 9, 119, 4, 4182, 50, 2476, 1851, 2144, 416, 1622]",2378.0,23937708,35

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients with penile or scrotal squamous cell carcinoma who had visited our tertiary cancer centre between 2002 and 2009, including their subsequent treatment and follow-up. We collected details of EGFR-targeted therapy and clinical outcomes. Treatment-associated time-to-disease-progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), responses to therapy and toxicity were evaluated. A total of 24 patients had received EGFR-targeted therapies, including cetuximab, erlotinib and gefitinib. The most common treatment given (to 67% of patients) was cetuximab combined with one or more cytotoxic drugs. The most common adverse effect was skin rash (71%). The median (range) TTP and OS were 11.3 (1-40) and 29.6 (2-205) weeks, respectively. The OS time for patients with visceral or bone metastases was significantly shorter than it was for those without (24.7 vs 49.9 weeks, P = 0.013). Among 17 patients treated with cetuximab alone or in combination with cisplatin, there were four partial responses (23.5%) including two patients with apparently chemotherapy-resistant tumours.

"Stage presentation, care patterns, and treatment outcomes for squamous cell carcinoma of the penis.","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2013-10-09,"Penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a rare entity, with few published series on outcomes. We evaluated the stage distributions and outcomes for surgery and radiation therapy in a U.S. population database. Subjects with SCC of the penis were identified using the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program database between 1988 and 2006. Descriptive statistics were performed, and cause-specific survival (CSS) was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Comparisons of treatment modalities were analyzed using multivariate Cox regression. Subjects were staged using American Joint Committee on Cancer, sixth edition, criteria. There were 2458 subjects identified. The median age was 66.8 years (range, 17-102 years). Grade 2 disease was present in 94.5% of cases. T1, T2, T3, T4, and Tx disease was present in 64.8%, 17.1%, 9.5%, 2.1%, and 6.5% of cases, respectively. N0, N1, N2, N3, and Nx disease was noted in 61.6%, 6.9%, 4.0%, 3.7%, and 23.8% of cases, respectively. M1 disease was noted in 2.5% of subjects. Individuals of white ethnicity accounted for 85.1% of cases. Lymphadenectomy was performed in 16.7% of cases. The CSS for all patients at 5 and 10 years was 80.8% and 78.6%.

Clinicopathologic characteristics and outcomes of penile cancer treated at tertiary care centers in the Western United States.,Clinical genitourinary cancer,Clin Genitourin Cancer,2013-09-27,"This article reports on the experience with penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) in a unique multiethnic patient population from Los Angeles, California, with regard to treatments rendered and clinical outcomes. Available clinical, pathologic, and treatment information for PSCC patients treated at 3 hospitals associated with the University of Southern California from 1991 to 2011 was retrospectively reviewed. Associations of patient variables with prognosis were assessed using univariable and multivariable analyses. Of the 95 PSCC patients identified, clinicopathologic and outcome information was available on 89 men (median age, 53 years; median follow-up, 23 months). National minorities comprised 76.4% of the cohort with 57.3% Hispanics accounting for all patients. Presence of poorly differentiated tumors was associated with higher tumor stage (P = .020), nodal metastasis (P = .016), distant metastasis (P = .004), and advanced AJCC disease stage (P = .001). Univariate analysis showed that tumor (P = .008), nodal (P = .033), and metastasis (P < .001) stage, and tumor differentiation (P = .010) were associated with survival. When categorized according to the AJCC classification, patients with ≥ stage III disease had worse outcomes (P = .006). Type of primary therapy delivered did not affect outcomes. AJCC disease stage was independently prognostic in multivariable analysis (P = .035). These results confirm associations of several clinicopathologic factors with PSCC outcomes, although the presented population differs from others previously described from the United States with a relatively higher proportion of Hispanic men.

Oncol.,2013-12-12,"Prognostic factors in men with penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) receiving systemic therapy are unknown. A prognostic classification system in this disease may facilitate interpretation of outcomes and guide rational drug development. We performed a retrospective analysis to identify prognostic factors in men with PSCC receiving first-line systemic therapy for advanced disease. Individual patient level data were obtained from 13 institutions to study prognostic factors in the context of first-line systemic therapy for advanced PSCC. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was conducted to examine the prognostic effect of these candidate factors on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS): age, stage, hemoglobin, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, albumin, site of metastasis (visceral or nonvisceral), smoking, circumcision, regimen, ECOG performance status (PS), lymphovascular invasion, precancerous lesion, and surgery following chemotherapy. The effect of different treatments was then evaluated adjusting for factors in the prognostic model. The study included 140 eligible men. Mean age across all men was 57.0 years. Among them, 8.6%, 21.4%, and 70.0% of patients had stage 2, 3, and 4 diseases, respectively; 40.7% had ECOG PS ≥ 1, 47.4% had visceral metastases, and 73.6% received cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The multivariate model of poor prognostic factors included visceral metastases (P<0.001) and ECOG PS ≥ 1 (P<0.001) for both PFS and OS. A risk stratification model constructed with 0, 1, and both poor prognostic factors was internally validated and demonstrated moderate discriminatory ability (c-statistic of 0.657 and 0.677 for OS and PFS, respectively). The median OS for the entire population was 9 months. Median OS was not reached, 8, and 7 months for those with 0, 1, and both risk factors, respectively. Cisplatin-based regimens were associated with better OS (P = 0.017) but not PFS (P = 0.37) compared with noncisplatin-based regimens after adjusting for the 2 prognostic factors. In men with advanced PSCC receiving first-line systemic therapy, visceral metastases and ECOG PS ≥ 1 were poor prognostic factors. A prognostic model including these factors exhibited moderate discriminatory ability for outcomes and warrants external validation.

Update in systemic therapy of urologic malignancies.,Postgraduate medicine,Postgrad Med,2014-01-01,"Systemic therapy of advanced prostate and renal cancers has gained several recent additions to the therapeutic armamentarium. Treatment of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer now includes additional immunotherapy (sipuleucel-T), chemotherapy (cabazitaxel), androgen-signaling inhibitors (abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide), and a radiopharmaceutical (alpharadin), based on extension of patient survival. Similarly, therapy for patients with renal cell carcinoma, a chemoresistant malignancy, has undergone dramatic changes based on an understanding of the role of angiogenesis. Multiple vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib, bevacizumab) and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (temsirolimus, everolimus) have been added to the therapeutic arsenal. Additionally, immunotherapy retains an important treatment role, with a continuing application of high-dose interleukin-2 in select patients and the emergence of novel immunotherapeutic agents that may have significant benefit. Other major urologic malignancies, including urothelial, testicular, and penile cancers, have witnessed relatively few or no recent advances in therapy, although testicular germ cell tumors are one of the most curable malignancies. An agent for treatment of advanced urothelial cancer now has commercial approval, the chemotherapeutic agent, vinflunine, as second-line therapy in multiple countries-but not in the United States.

Management of advanced primary urethral carcinomas.,BJU international,BJU Int.,2014-05-22,"Primary urethral carcinoma (PUC) is a rare malignancy accounting for <1% of genitourinary cancers, with a predilection for men and African-Americans. The sites and histology of urethral carcinoma vary by gender and anatomical location. Squamous cell carcinoma is most common among both genders but adenocarcinomas are noted in 15-35% of cases among women. Obstructive or irritative symptoms and haematuria are common modes of presentation. Clinical evaluation includes cystourethroscopy with biopsy and examination under anaesthesia. Magnetic resonance imaging provides a highly effective method to image the primary tumour while defıning the potential involvement of surrounding structures. Most tumours are localised, with regional metastases to nodal sites seen in up to 30% of cases in both genders, while distant metastases at presentation are rare (0-6%), but occur in up to 40% of cases with recurrent disease. Among men, the two most important prognostic factors are disease location and stage. Low-stage tumours (T1-2) and tumours involving the fossa navicularis or the penile urethra have a better prognosis than higher stage tumours (>T2 or N+) and lesions involving the bulbomembranous urethra. In women, in addition to stage and location, the size of the tumour has also prognostic implications. While surgery and radiation therapy (RT) are of benefit in early stage disease, advanced stage PUC requires multimodal treatment strategies to optimise local control and survival. These include induction chemotherapy followed by surgery or RT and concurrent chemoradiation with or without surgery.

Contemporary management of penile cancer: greater than 15 year MSKCC experience.,The Canadian journal of urology,Can J Urol,2014-04-01,"Penile cancer is a rare malignancy, and few guidelines are available to define treatment paradigms. For greater understanding of the natural history of surgically treated penile cancer, we analyzed the experience at our institution. Using an institutional database, we identified 127 patients treated for squamous cell carcinoma of the penis from 1995-2011. Cancer-specific survival (CSS) was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Survival data were compared using the log-rank test. The difference in risk of cancer-specific death by lymph node status and histological grade was determined by univariate Cox regression analysis. Five year CSS for pTis, pT1, pT2, and pT3/4 was 100%, 84% (95% CI 58%-95%), 54% (95% CI 33%-71%), and 54% (95% CI 25%-76%), respectively (p ≤ .005). Three year CSS for patients with N0, N+, and Nx disease was 90% (95% CI 47%-99%), 65% (95% CI 47%-79%), and 86% (95% CI 73%-93%), respectively (p = .03). The receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy did not change per 5 year period over the 16 years of our study. Median follow up was 2.8 years. Penile cancer patients with advanced disease had poor survival. Tumor stage and nodal status were significant predictors of CSS.

Helical tomotherapy with dynamic running-start-stop delivery compared to conventional tomotherapy delivery.,Medical physics,Med Phys,2014-05-01,"Despite superior target dose uniformity, helical tomotherapy(®) (HT) may involve a trade-off between longitudinal dose conformity and beam-on time (BOT), due to the limitation of only three available jaw sizes with the conventional HT (1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 cm). The recently introduced dynamic running-start-stop (RSS) delivery allows smaller jaw opening at the superior and inferior ends of the target when a sharp penumbra is needed. This study compared the dosimetric performance of RSS delivery with the fixed jaw HT delivery. Twenty patient cases were selected and deidentified prior to treatment planning, including 16 common clinical cases (brain, head and neck (HN), lung, and prostate) and four special cases of whole brain with hippocampus avoidance (WBHA) that require a high degree of dose modulation. HT plans were generated for common clinical cases using the fixed 2.5 cm jaw width (HT2.5) and WBHA cases using 1.0 cm (HT1.0). The jaw widths for RSS were preset with a larger size (RSS5.0 vs HT2.5 and RSS2.5 vs HT1.0). Both delivery techniques were planned based on identical contours, prescriptions, and planning objectives. Dose indices for targets and critical organs were compared using dose-volume histograms, BOT, and monitor units. The average BOT was reduced from 4.8 min with HT2.5 to 2.5 min with RSS5.0. Target dose homogeneity with RSS5.0 was shown comparable to HT2.5 for common clinical sites. Superior normal tissue sparing was observed in RSS5.0 for optic nerves and optic chiasm in brain and HN cases. RSS5.0 demonstrated improved dose sparing for cord and esophagus in lung cases, as well as penile bulb in prostate cases. The mean body dose was comparable for both techniques. For the WBHA cases, the target homogeneity was significantly degraded in RSS2.5 without distinct dose sparing for hippocampus, compared to HT1.0. Compared to the fixed jaw HT delivery, RSS combined with a larger jaw width provides faster treatment delivery and improved cranial-caudal target dose conformity. The target coverage achieved by RSS with a large jaw width is comparable to the fixed jaw HT delivery for common cancer sites, but may deteriorate for cases where complex geometry is present in the middle part of the target.",Comparative Study,2091.0,10.0,Despite superior target dose uniformity helical tomotherapy ® HT may involve a trade-off between longitudinal dose conformity and beam-on time BOT due to the limitation of only three available jaw sizes with the conventional HT 1.0 2.5 and 5.0 cm The recently introduced dynamic running-start-stop RSS delivery allows smaller jaw opening at the superior and inferior ends of the target when a sharp penumbra is needed This study compared the dosimetric performance of RSS delivery with the fixed jaw HT delivery Twenty patient cases were selected and deidentified prior to treatment planning including 16 common clinical cases brain head and HN and and four special cases of whole brain with hippocampus avoidance WBHA that require a high degree of dose modulation HT plans were generated for common clinical cases using the fixed 2.5 cm jaw width HT2.5 and WBHA cases using 1.0 cm HT1.0 The jaw widths for RSS were preset with a larger size RSS5.0 vs HT2.5 and RSS2.5 vs HT1.0 Both delivery techniques were planned based on identical contours prescriptions and planning objectives Dose indices for targets and critical organs were compared using dose-volume histograms BOT and monitor units The average BOT was reduced from 4.8 min with HT2.5 to 2.5 min with RSS5.0 Target dose homogeneity with RSS5.0 was shown comparable to HT2.5 for common clinical sites Superior normal tissue sparing was observed in RSS5.0 for optic nerves and optic chiasm in brain and HN cases RSS5.0 demonstrated improved dose sparing for cord and in cases as well as bulb in cases The mean body dose was comparable for both techniques For the WBHA cases the target homogeneity was significantly degraded in RSS2.5 without distinct dose sparing for hippocampus compared to HT1.0 Compared to the fixed jaw HT delivery RSS combined with a larger jaw width provides faster treatment delivery and improved cranial-caudal target dose conformity The target coverage achieved by RSS with a large jaw width is comparable to the fixed jaw HT delivery for common cancer sites but may deteriorate for cases where complex geometry is present in the middle part of the target,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[550, 1123, 283, 61, 9338, 6638, 7731, 6081, 3152, 68, 3882, 8, 10550, 1889, 59, 2380, 61, 8693, 2, 1345, 23, 98, 21611, 520, 6, 3, 5039, 1, 158, 169, 390, 7670, 4131, 5, 3, 809, 3152, 14, 13, 18, 33, 2, 33, 13, 494, 3, 761, 3955, 2540, 18585, 2435, 7142, 15697, 989, 2333, 2170, 7670, 11677, 28, 3, 1123, 2, 1663, 10894, 1, 3, 283, 198, 8, 9978, 20675, 16, 575, 26, 45, 72, 3, 3187, 528, 1, 15697, 989, 5, 3, 1959, 7670, 3152, 989, 737, 69, 140, 11, 715, 2, 19849, 324, 6, 24, 1349, 141, 245, 186, 38, 140, 342, 718, 2, 9132, 2, 2, 294, 3714, 140, 1, 902, 342, 5, 17944, 5863, 40709, 17, 1353, 8, 64, 1444, 1, 61, 2356, 3152, 1853, 11, 1419, 9, 186, 38, 140, 75, 3, 1959, 18, 33, 494, 7670, 5195, 35803, 33, 2, 40709, 140, 75, 14, 13, 494, 40710, 13, 3, 7670, 23880, 9, 15697, 11, 35804, 5, 8, 1077, 444, 32273, 13, 105, 35803, 33, 2, 48327, 33, 105, 40710, 13, 110, 989, 1092, 11, 1465, 90, 23, 3038, 6137, 7654, 2, 1349, 2409, 61, 3824, 9, 637, 2, 740, 2285, 11, 72, 75, 61, 433, 8638, 21611, 2, 3334, 2960, 3, 1011, 21611, 10, 405, 29, 39, 66, 1538, 5, 35803, 33, 6, 18, 33, 1538, 5, 32273, 13, 283, 61, 7502, 5, 32273, 13, 10, 443, 1279, 6, 35803, 33, 9, 186, 38, 633, 1123, 295, 246, 1851, 10, 164, 4, 32273, 13, 9, 5670, 6721, 2, 5670, 14583, 4, 342, 2, 9132, 140, 32273, 13, 264, 231, 61, 1851, 9, 1885, 2, 4, 140, 22, 149, 22, 18572, 4, 140, 3, 313, 642, 61, 10, 1279, 9, 110, 1092, 9, 3, 40709, 140, 3, 283, 7502, 10, 97, 10034, 4, 48327, 33, 187, 834, 61, 1851, 9, 17944, 72, 6, 40710, 13, 72, 6, 3, 1959, 7670, 3152, 989, 15697, 397, 5, 8, 1077, 7670, 5195, 777, 5308, 24, 989, 2, 231, 2565, 17595, 283, 61, 8693, 3, 283, 2139, 513, 20, 15697, 5, 8, 375, 7670, 5195, 16, 1279, 6, 3, 1959, 7670, 3152, 989, 9, 186, 12, 633, 84, 68, 26086, 9, 140, 1257, 840, 12337, 16, 364, 4, 3, 3897, 760, 1, 3, 283]",2138.0,24784375,41
Concurrent chemoradiotherapy for men with locally advanced penile squamous cell carcinoma.,Clinical genitourinary cancer,Clin Genitourin Cancer,2014-03-27,"Outcomes with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) are unclear, and only anecdotal reports have been published. This study was a retrospective analysis of patients who received concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy for PSCC. Individual patient-level data were obtained from 5 institutions for outcomes with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for PSCC. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and univariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was conducted to examine the prognostic effect of candidate factors on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). A total of 26 men were evaluable. The mean age was 60.3 years. The clinical stage was ≤ III in 9 patients (36%) and stage IV in the rest. Soft tissue and visceral metastasis were present in 35% and 20% of patients, respectively. The chemotherapy was cisplatin-based in 92.3% of patients, and the median (range) of external beam radiotherapy administered was 4900 cGy (range, 1800-7000 cGy). The median OS was 6.9 months (95% CI, 5-14), and the median PFS was 5.1 months (95% CI, 2.5-7.0). When excluding patients with M1 disease, the remaining patients (n = 21) had a median OS and PFS of 10.0 months (95% CI, 5-14) and 6.0 months (95% CI, 2.0-7.0), respectively.

Two tissue microarrays were constructed from 53 invasive penile SCC at our hospital. p16(INK4a) expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (CINtec Kit). High-risk human papillomavirus status was assessed by in situ hybridization (INFORM HPV III family 16 probe B cocktail). High-risk human papillomavirus was detected in 8 cases (15%), and p16(INK4a) overexpression was found in 23 cases (44%). Both markers showed a significant association with histologic subtype (P = .017 and P = .01, respectively) and lymphovascular invasion (P = .015 and P = .015, respectively). Regarding outcome analyses, neither HPV infection nor p16(INK4a) overexpression significantly predicted overall survival or cancer-specific survival using Cox proportional hazards regression model.

Dose painting to treat single-lobe prostate cancer with hypofractionated high-dose radiation using targeted external beam radiation: Is it feasible?,Medical dosimetry : official journal of the American Association of Medical Dosimetrists,Med Dosim,2015-03-29,"Targeted focal therapy strategies for treating single-lobe prostate cancer are under investigation. In this planning study, we investigate the feasibility of treating a portion of the prostate to full-dose external beam radiation with reduced dose to the opposite lobe, compared with full-dose radiation delivered to the entire gland using hypofractionated radiation. For 10 consecutive patients with low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer, 2 hypofractionated, single-arc volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans were designed. The first plan (standard hypofractionation regimen [STD]) included the entire prostate gland, treated to 70 Gy delivered in 28 fractions. The second dose painting plan (DP) encompassed the involved lobe treated to 70 Gy delivered in 28 fractions, whereas the opposing, uninvolved lobe received 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. Mean dose to the opposing neurovascular bundle (NVB) was considerably lower for DP vs STD, with a mean dose of 53.9 vs 72.3 Gy (p < 0.001). Mean penile bulb dose was 18.6 Gy for DP vs 19.2 Gy for STD (p = 0.880). Mean rectal dose was 21.0 Gy for DP vs 22.8 Gy for STD (p = 0.356). Rectum V70 (the volume receiving ≥70 Gy) was 2.01% for DP vs 2.74% for STD (p = 0.328). Bladder V70 was 1.69% for DP vs 2.78% for STD (p = 0.232).

Landmarks in erectile function recovery after radical prostatectomy.,Nature reviews. Urology,Nat Rev Urol,2015-04-14,"The description of the nerve-sparing technique of radical prostatectomy by Walsh was one of the major breakthroughs in the surgical treatment of prostate cancer in the 20(th) century. However, despite this advance and consequent technological refinements to nerve-sparing surgery, a large proportion of men still suffer from erectile dysfunction (ED) as a complication of prostatectomy. A plethora of therapeutic approaches have been proposed to optimize erectile function recovery in these patients. Several preclinical and translational studies have shown benefits of therapies including PDE5 inhibitor (PDE5I) treatment, immunomodulation, neurotrophic factor administration, and regenerative techniques, such as stem cell therapy, in animal models. However, most of these approaches have either failed to translate to clinical use or have yet to be studied in human subjects.

A phase 1 study of ABT-806 in subjects with advanced solid tumors.,Investigational new drugs,Invest New Drugs,2015-04-17,"ABT-806, a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody, binds a unique epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) epitope exposed in the EGFRde2-7 (EGFRvIII) deletion mutant and other EGFR proteins in the activated state. This phase I study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and recommended phase two dose (RP2D) of ABT-806 in patients with solid tumors that commonly overexpress activated EGFR or EGFRvlll. Patients with advanced solid tumors, including glioblastoma, were eligible. Following a dose escalation phase, expanded safety cohorts of patients with solid tumors or EGFR-amplified glioblastoma were enrolled. Adverse events (AEs) were graded by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0; tumor response was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1. EGFR protein expression was quantified by immunohistochemistry. 49 patients were treated. Frequent AEs (≥10 %) possibly/probably related to ABT-806 were fatigue (18 %), nausea (16 %), dermatitis acneiform (12 %), and vomiting (10 %). Only one dose-limiting toxicity (grade three morbilliform rash) occurred. The RP2D was the pre-specified highest dose (24 mg/kg). Systemic exposures were dose proportional between 2 and 24 mg/kg. Median time to progression was 55 days (95 % confidence interval, 53-57) in all patients and 43 days (22-57) for glioblastoma patients. No objective responses occurred; however, two patients had prolonged stable disease. An EGFR-amplified penile cancer patient has stable disease lasting over 2.5 years. ABT-806 has unique pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. Toxicities were infrequent and typically low grade at the RP2D.

Comprehensive Genomic Profiling of Advanced Penile Carcinoma Suggests a High Frequency of Clinically Relevant Genomic Alterations.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2015-12-15,"Advanced penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) is associated with poor survival due to the aggressiveness of the disease and lack of effective systemic therapies. Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) was performed to identify clinically relevant genomic alterations (CRGAs). DNA was extracted from 40 μm of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections in patients with advanced PSCC. CGP was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation-based libraries to a mean coverage depth of 692× for 3,769 exons of 236 cancer-related genes plus 47 introns from 19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. CRGAs were defined as genomic alterations (GAs) linked to targeted therapies on the market or under evaluation in mechanism-driven clinical trials. Twenty male patients with a median age of 60 years (range, 46-87 years) were assessed. Seventeen (85%) cases were stage IV and three cases (15%) were stage III. CGP revealed 109 GAs (5.45 per tumor), 44 of which were CRGAs (2.2 per tumor). At least one CRGA was detected in 19 (95%) cases, and the most common CRGAs were CDKN2A point mutations and homozygous deletion (40%), NOTCH1 point mutations and rearrangements (25%), PIK3CA point mutations and amplification (25%), EGFR amplification (20%), CCND1 amplification (20%), BRCA2 insertions/deletions (10%), RICTOR amplifications (10%), and FBXW7 point mutations (10%). CGP identified CRGAs in patients with advanced PSCC, including EGFR amplification and PIK3CA alterations, which can lead to the rational administration of targeted therapy and subsequent benefit for these patients. Few treatment options exist for patients with advanced penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC). Outcomes are dismal with platinum-based chemotherapy, with median survival estimated at 1 year or less across multiple series. Biological studies of patients with PSCC to date have principally focused on human papillomavirus status, but few studies have elucidated molecular drivers of the disease. To this end, comprehensive genomic profiling was performed in a cohort of 20 patients with advanced PSCC. Findings of frequent mutations in CDKN2A, NOTCH1, PIK3CA, and EGFR (all in excess of 20%) point to potential therapeutic avenues.

Overexpression of Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 Receptor Is Associated With Penile Cancer Progression.,Urology,Urology,2016-02-18,"To evaluate insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) expression in penile cancer and its association with oncologic outcomes. Tissue microarrays were constructed from 53 patients treated at our institution. Expression of IGF1R was evaluated using a Her2-like scoring system.

A total of 52 patients with penile squamous cell cancer who were treated at the University of Southern California from 1995 to 2010 were identified. Paraffin-embedded tissue underwent mRNA quantitation and immunohistochemistry for expression of EGFR, ERCC1, and TS. KRAS mutations were evaluated using polymerase chain reaction-based sequencing. EGFR overexpression was common by mRNA (median, 5.09; range, 1.92-104.5) and immunohistochemistry. EGFR expression > 7 was associated with advanced stage and poor differentiation (P = .01 and .034 respectively) but not with survival in multivariate analysis. ERCC1 mRNA expression was a median of 0.65 (range, 0.21-1.87). TS expression was a median of 1.88 (range, 0.54-6.47). ERCC1 and TS expression were not associated with grade, stage, or survival. There were no KRAS mutations identified. A total of 17 men received chemotherapy; 8 (47%) had an objective response, including 1 with a pathologic complete response. There was a trend for lower expression of EGFR corresponding to a higher likelihood of response (response rate [RR]) to chemotherapy: 67% RR in EGFR mRNA < 7 versus 33% RR in EGFR > 7 (P = .31). High expression of EGFR mRNA in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis is associated with advanced stage and poor differentiation, but not survival.

Immune-checkpoint status in penile squamous cell carcinoma: a North American cohort.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2016-09-20,"Penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is primarily treated by surgical resection. Locally advanced and metastatic diseases require a multidisciplinary treatment approach. However, mortality and morbidity remain high, and novel molecular and immunotherapeutic targets are actively being sought. We investigated the expression of immune-checkpoint markers in penile cancers. Fifty-three invasive penile SCCs diagnosed between 1985 and 2013 were retrieved from our surgical pathology archives. Representative formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival blocks were used for the construction of 2 high-density tissue microarrays. Tissue microarrays were stained with immunohistochemistry for PD-L1, FOXP3, CD8, and Ki-67. PD-L1 was investigated using rabbit monoclonal anti-PD-L1 antibody (Cell Signaling, Boston, MA; E1L3N, 1:100). Overall, 21 (40%) of 53 penile SCCs had positive PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 was expressed by a significant proportion of advanced penile SCC. Forty-four percent (15/34) of stage pT2 or more SCC and 38% (6/16) of tumors with lymph node metastasis were positive for PD-L1. PD-L1 expression did not correlate with patient age, tumor location, histologic subtype, tumor stage, anatomic depth of invasion, or tumor grade. FOXP3 expression in tumoral immune cells was found in 26 (49%) of 53 cases. FOXP3 expression in stromal immune cells correlated with tumor thickness (P = .0086). The ratio of CD8/FOXP3 was greater than 1 in 62% of cases in tumor-infiltrating immune cells and 34% of cases in stromal immune cells. Our current study is the largest to assess expression of PD-L1 in a clinically well-annotated North American cohort of penile SCC.

Men who underwent LND for penile SCC from 1977 to 2014 were identified from an institutional database. Kaplan-Meier curves estimated recurrence-free survival (RFS) calculated from the date of LND. Cox regression models evaluated the association between RFS and patient and tumour characteristics. In all, 182 men who underwent LND for penile SCC were identified. The median patient age was 62 years and the median follow-up was 4.2 years. After LND 34 men had regional recurrence, of which 24 developed isolated regional recurrences without distant metastasis. The median RFS was 5.7 months, and the 3-year RFS rate was 70%. On univariate analysis, lymphovascular invasion, clinical and pathological nodal stage, pathological inguinal laterality, pelvic nodal involvement, lymph node density ≥5.2%, ≥3 pathologically involved lymph nodes, and extranodal extension (ENE) were associated with worse RFS (all P < 0.05). On multivariate analysis, clinical N3 disease [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR)] 3.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.68-7.45; P = 0.001), ≥3 pathologically involved lymph nodes (AHR 3.78, 95% CI 2.12-6.65; P < 0.001), and ENE (AHR 3.32, 95% CI 1.93-5.76; P < 0.001) were associated with worse RFS. The 3-year RFS for patients with cN0, cN1, cN2, and cN3 disease was 91.7%, 64.5%, 54.7%, and 38.3%, respectively.

Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis Dysfunction in Survivors of Childhood CNS Tumors: Importance of Systematic Follow-Up and Early Endocrine Consultation.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-10-31,"The Oncology Grand Rounds series is designed to place original reports published in the Journal into clinical context. A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of the relevant literature, and a summary of the authors' suggested management approaches. The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published in Journal of Clinical Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice. An 11-year-old male with a history of metastatic tectal plate low-grade glioma who was diagnosed at age 2.8 years transferred his care to the long-term follow-up clinic. He completed treatment with multiagent chemotherapy-carboplatin, vincristine, temozolomide, procarbazine, lomustine, and thioguanine-at age 4.5 years and did not require radiotherapy. At primary diagnosis, he presented with hydrocephalus that required ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement, with a subsequent shunt revision at age 6 years. Residual metastatic tumors in the third and fourth ventricles and in the suprasellar region remained stable for more than 5 years. The patient achieved normal developmental milestones and was not taking medications. He was offered screening for hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) dysfunction because of his suprasellar lesion. His height was at the 25th percentile for chronological age, with decline from the 50th percentile noted during the preceding 18 months ( Fig 1 , point c). Pubertal stage was Tanner 4 for pubic hair and penile size, which contrasted with small testes (4.5 mL). Pubic hair and voice changes were noticed 2 to 3 years before this visit. Plasma testosterone level was consistent with Tanner 4 (255 ng/dL = 8.9 nmol/L). An x-ray of the left hand revealed a notably advanced bone age of 15.5 years. Plasma free T4, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and 8 am cortisol levels were normal. The patient was referred to the endocrinology clinic where he was diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency and was started on replacement therapy. He reached his final adult height of 144.1 cm at age 13.3 years ( Fig 1 , point d).",Journal Article,1177.0,9.0,The Oncology Grand Rounds series is designed to place original reports published in the Journal into clinical context A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges a review of the relevant literature and a summary of the authors suggested management approaches The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies including those published in Journal of Clinical Oncology to patients seen in their own clinical practice An 11-year-old male with a history of metastatic tectal plate low-grade glioma who was diagnosed at age 2.8 years transferred his care to the long-term follow-up clinic He completed treatment with multiagent chemotherapy-carboplatin vincristine temozolomide procarbazine lomustine and thioguanine-at age 4.5 years and did not require radiotherapy At primary diagnosis he presented with hydrocephalus that required ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement with a subsequent shunt revision at age 6 years Residual metastatic tumors in the third and fourth ventricles and in the suprasellar region remained stable for more than 5 years The patient achieved normal developmental milestones and was not taking medications He was offered screening for hypothalamic-pituitary axis HPA dysfunction because of his suprasellar lesion His height was at the 25th percentile for chronological age with decline from the 50th percentile noted during the preceding 18 months Fig 1 point c Pubertal stage was Tanner 4 for pubic hair and size which contrasted with small testes 4.5 mL Pubic hair and voice changes were noticed 2 to 3 years before this visit Plasma testosterone level was consistent with Tanner 4 255 ng/dL 8.9 nmol/L An x-ray of the left hand revealed a notably advanced age of 15.5 years Plasma free T4 thyroid-stimulating hormone TSH and 8 am cortisol levels were normal The patient was referred to the endocrinology clinic where he was diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency and was started on replacement therapy He reached his final adult height of 144.1 cm at age 13.3 years Fig 1 point d,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[3, 413, 20904, 7001, 988, 16, 1114, 6, 3536, 2279, 1198, 983, 4, 3, 6685, 237, 38, 1533, 8, 473, 1031, 16, 370, 20, 8, 5263, 1, 752, 2, 284, 1427, 8, 206, 1, 3, 867, 789, 2, 8, 1962, 1, 3, 738, 1148, 284, 611, 3, 1326, 1, 26, 988, 16, 6, 987, 5439, 380, 1640, 832, 6, 4930, 3, 99, 1, 825, 94, 141, 135, 983, 4, 6685, 1, 38, 413, 6, 7, 527, 4, 136, 4165, 38, 758, 35, 175, 111, 1095, 1045, 5, 8, 532, 1, 113, 27458, 9656, 154, 88, 945, 54, 10, 265, 28, 89, 18, 66, 60, 4747, 3224, 165, 6, 3, 319, 337, 166, 126, 1188, 3174, 781, 24, 5, 7148, 56, 927, 2132, 1537, 8860, 9181, 2, 17598, 28, 89, 39, 33, 60, 2, 205, 44, 1353, 310, 28, 86, 147, 3174, 917, 5, 9250, 17, 616, 16283, 8637, 2613, 5, 8, 706, 8637, 5646, 28, 89, 49, 60, 753, 113, 57, 4, 3, 1282, 2, 3608, 25419, 2, 4, 3, 13122, 1053, 958, 585, 9, 80, 76, 33, 60, 3, 69, 513, 295, 4566, 12118, 2, 10, 44, 2727, 2679, 3174, 10, 2216, 453, 9, 7531, 12098, 2310, 14513, 1527, 408, 1, 3224, 13122, 1180, 3224, 4594, 10, 28, 3, 14939, 6392, 9, 14921, 89, 5, 1858, 29, 3, 25065, 6392, 1051, 190, 3, 5892, 203, 53, 14197, 14, 741, 256, 10467, 82, 10, 17471, 39, 9, 24676, 6845, 2, 444, 92, 13257, 5, 302, 13100, 39, 33, 542, 24676, 6845, 2, 6284, 400, 11, 16285, 18, 6, 27, 60, 348, 26, 2807, 554, 2660, 301, 10, 925, 5, 17471, 39, 7826, 997, 1826, 66, 83, 4694, 805, 35, 1006, 5520, 1, 3, 1712, 2833, 553, 8, 2552, 131, 89, 1, 167, 33, 60, 554, 115, 2463, 11260, 2122, 785, 6581, 2, 66, 5886, 9572, 148, 11, 295, 3, 69, 10, 1995, 6, 3, 21338, 1188, 1257, 3174, 10, 265, 5, 129, 785, 2299, 2, 10, 3461, 23, 3892, 36, 3174, 1300, 3224, 1457, 780, 4594, 1, 4415, 14, 494, 28, 89, 233, 27, 60, 14197, 14, 741, 427]",2102.0,27998231,54
Lymph node density predicts recurrence and death after inguinal lymph node dissection for penile cancer.,Investigative and clinical urology,Investig Clin Urol,2017-01-04,"To determine the impact of lymph node density (LND) on survival after inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) for penile cancer. Our institutional penile cancer database was queried for patients who underwent ILND. Clinicopathologic characteristics including LND and total number of positive lymph nodes (LNs) were analyzed to determine impact on recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). LND, or the percent of positive LN out of total LN, was calculated as a categorical variable at varying thresholds. Twenty-eight patients with complete follow-up were identified. Indications for ILND were stage >T2 in 20 patients (71.4%), palpable adenopathy in 7 (25%), high grade T1 in 1 (3.6%). Median node yield was 17.5 (interquartile range, 12-22), and positive LNs were found in 14 patients (50%).

Clinical Outcomes of Perioperative Chemotherapy in Patients With Locally Advanced Penile Squamous-Cell Carcinoma: Results of a Multicenter Analysis.,Clinical genitourinary cancer,Clin Genitourin Cancer,2017-02-27,"The prognosis of patients with locally advanced penile squamous-cell carcinoma is primarily related to the extent of lymph node metastases. Surgery alone yields suboptimal results, and there is a paucity of data on these patients' outcomes. This retrospective study evaluated patients who received neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy from 1990 onward at 12 centers. Cox models were used to investigate prognostic factors for relapse-free survival and overall survival (OS). Among the 201 included patients, 39 (19.4%) had disease of T3-4 and N0 clinical stage; the remaining patients had clinical lymph node involvement (cN+). Ninety-four patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (group 1), 78 received adjuvant chemotherapy (group 2), and 21 received both (group 3). Eight patients for whom the timing of perioperative chemotherapy administration was unavailable were included in the Cox analyses. Forty-three patients (21.4%) received chemoradiation. Multivariate analysis for OS (n = 172) revealed bilateral disease (P = .035) as a negative prognostic factor, while pelvic cN+ tended to be nonsignificantly associated with decreased OS (P = .076). One-year relapse-free survival was 35.6%, 60.6%, and 45.1% in the 3 groups, respectively. One-year OS was 61.3%, 82.2%, and 75%, respectively. No significant differences were seen on univariable analyses for OS between the groups (P = .45).

Kinase analysis of penile squamous cell carcinoma on multiple platforms to identify potential therapeutic targets.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2017-03-01,"Penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) is an orphan malignancy with poorly understood biology and suboptimal systemic therapy. Given that kinases may be drivers and readily actionable, we performed comprehensive multiplatform analysis of kinases in PSCC tumor and normal tissue. Fresh frozen tumors were collected from 11 patients with PSCC. After macrodissection to demarcate tumor from normal tissue, the samples underwent multiplatform analysis of kinases. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of 517 kinase genes was performed using Agilent Kinome capture and run on the Illumina MiSeq at PE150bp. The NanoString nCounter® platform analyzed the expression of 519 kinase genes. Kinase activity of tissue lysates was measured using PamStation®12 high-content phospho-peptide substrate microarray system. Network mapping was done with GeneGo MetaCore™ and upstream kinase prediction was performed with BioNavigator and the Kinexus database. Ingenuity pathway analysis was performed to integrate elevated kinase activity and gene over-expression with coexisting missense mutations at DNA level. Top pathways upregulated in both the kinase activity and gene expression platforms were PTEN, STAT3, GNRH, IL-8 and B cell receptor signaling. Potentially relevant missense mutations were seen in 176 kinase genes, with the top altered pathways overlapping with gene overexpression being GNRH, NF-kB and STAT3 signaling. ERBB2, ERBB3 and SYK were altered on NGS and also exhibited elevated kinase activity. To summarize, multiplatform comprehensive analysis of kinases discovered potential drivers of PSCC and actionable therapeutic targets.

Erectile Dysfunction Treatment Following Radical Cystoprostatectomy: Analysis of a Nationwide Insurance Claims Database.,The journal of sexual medicine,J Sex Med,2017-04-29,"To improve care for patients after radical cystoprostatectomy (RCP), focus on survivorship issues such as sexual function needs to increase. Previous studies have demonstrated the burden of erectile dysfunction (ED) after RCP to be as high as 89%. To determine the rates of ED treatment use (phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, injectable therapies, urethral suppositories, vacuum erection devices, and penile prosthetics) in patients with bladder cancer before and after RCP to better understand current patterns of care. Men with bladder cancer undergoing RCP were identified in the MarketScan database (2010-2014). ED treatment use was assessed at baseline (during the 1 year before RCP) and at 6-month intervals (0-6, 7-12, 13-18, 19-24 months) after RCP. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of ED treatment use at 6-month intervals after RCP. ED treatment rates and predictors of ED treatment at 0-6, 7-12, 13-18, 19-24 month follow-up after RCP. At baseline, 6.5% of patients (77 of 1,176) used ED treatments. The rates of ED treatment use at 0 to 6, 7 to 12, 13 to 18, and 19 to 24 months after RCP were 15.2%, 12.7%, 8.1%, and 10.1% respectively. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors were the most commonly used treatment at all time points. In the multivariable model, predictors of ED treatment use at 0 to 6 months after RCP were age younger than 50 years (odds ratio [OR] = 3.17, 95% CI = 1.68-6.01), baseline ED treatment use (OR = 5.75, 95% CI = 3.08-10.72), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.13-2.61), and neobladder diversion (OR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.56-3.70). Baseline ED treatment use continued to be associated with ED treatment use at 6 to 12 months (OR = 5.63, 95% CI = 2.42-13.10) and 13 to 18 months (OR = 8.99, 95% CI = 3.05-26.51) after RCP. While the burden of ED following RCP is known to be high, overall ED treatment rates are low. These findings suggest either ED treatment is low priority for RCP patients or education about potential ED therapies may not be commonly discussed with patients following RCP. Urologists should consider discussing sexual function more frequently with their RCP patients. Strengths include the use of a national claims database, which allows for longitudinal follow-up and detailed information on prescription medications and devices. Limitations include the lack of pathologic and oncologic outcomes data. ED treatment use after RCP is quite low. The strongest predictor of ED treatment use after RCP was baseline treatment use. These findings suggest ED treatment is a low priority for patients with RCP or education about potential ED therapies might not be commonly discussed with patients after RCP.

"Isolation, Detection, and Quantification of Cancer Biomarkers in HPV-Associated Malignancies.",Scientific reports,Sci Rep,2017-06-12,"Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been recognized as the main etiologic factor in the development of various cancers including penile, vulva, oropharyngeal and cervical cancers. In the development of cancer, persistent HPV infections induce E6 and E7 oncoproteins, which promote cell proliferation and carcinogenesis resulting elevated levels of host antibodies (e.g., anti-HPV16 E7 antibody). Currently, these cancers are clinically diagnosed using invasive biopsy-based tests, which are performed only in centralized labs by experienced clinical staff using time-consuming and expensive tools and technologies. Therefore, these obstacles constrain their utilization at primary care clinics and in remote settings, where resources are limited. Here, we present a rapid, inexpensive, reliable, easy-to-use, customized immunoassay platform following a microfluidic filter device to detect and quantify anti-HPV16 E7 antibodies from whole blood as a non-invasive assisting technology for diagnosis of HPV-associated malignancies, especially, at primary healthcare and remote settings. The platform can detect and quantify anti-HPV16 E7 antibody down to 2.87 ng/mL. We further validated our immunoassay in clinical patient samples and it provided significantly high responses as compared to control samples.

Gene Expression Profiling of Advanced Penile Squamous Cell Carcinoma Receiving Cisplatin-based Chemotherapy Improves Prognostication and Identifies Potential Therapeutic Targets.,European urology focus,Eur Urol Focus,2016-08-27,"In men with advanced penile squamous cell carcinoma receiving first-line chemotherapy, visceral metastases (VM) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≥1 are poor prognostic factors for overall survival (OS). We hypothesized that tumor gene expression profiling may enhance prognostic stratification and identify potential therapeutic targets. In this retrospective study, RNA extracted from macrodissected tumors underwent profiling for the expression of 738 genes using NanoString. Univariate and multivariate analyses assessed the association of genes, VM, and performance status with OS. Tumors were available from 25 men who received first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy. In univariate analysis, upregulated MAML2 (p=0.004), KITLG (p≤0.0001), and JAK1 (p=0.029) genes were associated with poor OS, and upregulated FANCA was associated with better OS (p=0.024). In stepwise multivariate analyses, VM (hazard ratio=12.75, p=0.0001) and MAML2 (hazard ratio=10.411, p=0.003) were associated with poor OS. The presence of none, one, and both of these poor risk factors was associated with significantly different median OS of 18.4 mo, 7.2 mo, and 2.1 mo, respectively.

Differences in Survival Associated with Performance of Lymph Node Dissection in Patients with Invasive Penile Cancer: Results from the National Cancer Database.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2017-12-15,"Inguinal lymphadenectomy remains under performed in patients with invasive penile cancer. Using a large national cancer registry we assessed temporal trends in inguinal lymphadenectomy performance and evaluated the impact of the procedure on survival in patients in whom inguinal lymphadenectomy was an absolute indication (T1b-4 N0/x-1) according to NCCN<sup>®</sup> (National Comprehensive Cancer Network®) Guidelines®. We queried the National Cancer Database for all cases of nonmetastatic, T1b-4 N0/x-1 squamous cell carcinoma of the penis from 2004 to 2014. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for patient, demographic, and clinicopathological characteristics were used to examine the association between available covariates and receipt of inguinal lymphadenectomy. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was then done to assess the impact of clinical and pathological variables on overall survival. Propensity score weighted analysis was performed to assess the effect of inguinal lymphadenectomy on overall survival. A total of 2,224 patients met analysis criteria, of whom 606 (27.2%) underwent inguinal lymphadenectomy. Following adjustment the procedure was more likely in younger patients, those who presented with palpable adenopathy (cN1), those treated at an academic facility and those with a more contemporary diagnosis.

Trends in Risks for Second Primary Cancers Associated With Index Human Papillomavirus-Associated Cancers.,JAMA network open,JAMA Netw Open,2018-09-07,"In the last 4 decades, survival among patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers has improved, while the incidence of these cancers has increased among younger cohorts. Among survivors of HPV-associated cancers, persistent HPV infection may remain a risk factor for preventable HPV-associated second primary cancers (HPV-SPCs). To investigate the risk of HPV-SPCs among survivors of HPV-associated index cancers and to test the hypothesis that the HPV-SPC risk among these persons has increased over the last 4 decades. A retrospective cohort study of 9 cancer registries of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was conducted to identify patients with HPV-associated (cervical, vaginal, vulvar, oropharyngeal, anal, and penile) cancers diagnosed from January 1, 1973, through December 31, 2014. The dates of analysis were July 1, 2017, to January 31, 2018. The HPV-SPC risk was quantified by calculating standard incidence ratios (SIRs) and excess absolute risks (EARs) per 10 000 person-years at risk (PYR). The HPV-SPC risk by time was estimated using Poisson regression. From 113 272 (73 085 female and 40 187 male) survivors of HPV-associated cancers, 1397 women and 1098 men developed HPV-SPCs. The SIRs for HPV-SPCs were 6.2 (95% CI, 5.9-6.6) among women and 15.8 (95% CI, 14.9-16.8) among men. The EARs were 18.2 per 10 000 PYR for women and 53.5 per 10 000 PYR for men. Among both women and men, those who had index oropharyngeal cancers had the highest HPV-SPC risk (SIR, 19.8 [95% CI, 18.4-21.4] and EAR, 80.6 per 10 000 PYR among women; SIR, 18.0 [95% CI, 16.9-19.1] and EAR, 61.5 per 10 000 PYR among men). Women who had index cervical cancers and men who had index anal cancers had the lowest HPV-SPC risk (SIR, 2.4 [95% CI, 2.2-2.7] and EAR, 4.5 per 10 000 PYR among women; SIR, 6.5 [95% CI, 4.7-8.8] and EAR, 18.5 per 10 000 PYR among men). Both women and men who had index HPV-associated cancers of any kind had a significantly higher risk of oropharyngeal HPV-SPCs. Over the last 4 decades, the risk of developing most types of HPV-SPCs after index cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancers increased. According to this study, the HPV-SPC risk among survivors of HPV-associated cancers is significant, implying that persistent HPV infection at multiple sites may be associated with HPV-SPCs. These findings have the potential to inform surveillance recommendations for survivors of HPV-associated cancers.",Journal Article,501.0,4.0,In the last 4 decades survival among patients with human papillomavirus HPV -associated cancers has improved while the incidence of these cancers has increased among younger cohorts Among survivors of HPV-associated cancers persistent HPV infection may remain a risk factor for preventable HPV-associated second primary cancers HPV-SPCs To investigate the risk of HPV-SPCs among survivors of HPV-associated index cancers and to test the hypothesis that the HPV-SPC risk among these persons has increased over the last 4 decades A retrospective cohort study of 9 cancer registries of the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER database was conducted to identify patients with HPV-associated and cancers diagnosed from January 1 1973 through December 31 2014 The dates of analysis were July 1 2017 to January 31 2018 The HPV-SPC risk was quantified by calculating standard incidence ratios SIRs and excess absolute risks EARs per 10 000 person-years at risk PYR The HPV-SPC risk by time was estimated using Poisson regression From 113 272 73 085 female and 40 187 male survivors of HPV-associated cancers 1397 women and 1098 men developed HPV-SPCs The SIRs for HPV-SPCs were 6.2 95 CI 5.9-6.6 among women and 15.8 95 CI 14.9-16.8 among men The EARs were 18.2 per 10 000 PYR for women and 53.5 per 10 000 PYR for men Among both women and men those who had index cancers had the highest HPV-SPC risk SIR 19.8 95 CI 18.4-21.4 and EAR 80.6 per 10 000 PYR among women SIR 18.0 95 CI 16.9-19.1 and EAR 61.5 per 10 000 PYR among men Women who had index cancers and men who had index cancers had the lowest HPV-SPC risk SIR 2.4 95 CI 2.2-2.7 and EAR 4.5 per 10 000 PYR among women SIR 6.5 95 CI 4.7-8.8 and EAR 18.5 per 10 000 PYR among men Both women and men who had index HPV-associated cancers of any kind had a significantly higher risk of HPV-SPCs Over the last 4 decades the risk of developing most types of HPV-SPCs after index and cancers increased According to this study the HPV-SPC risk among survivors of HPV-associated cancers is significant implying that persistent HPV infection at multiple sites may be associated with HPV-SPCs These findings have the potential to inform surveillance recommendations for survivors of HPV-associated cancers,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[4, 3, 1060, 39, 1968, 25, 107, 7, 5, 171, 3242, 933, 41, 163, 71, 231, 369, 3, 287, 1, 46, 163, 71, 101, 107, 773, 736, 107, 332, 1, 933, 41, 163, 1882, 933, 930, 68, 918, 8, 43, 161, 9, 7936, 933, 41, 419, 86, 163, 933, 25885, 6, 963, 3, 43, 1, 933, 25885, 107, 332, 1, 933, 41, 558, 163, 2, 6, 412, 3, 1492, 17, 3, 933, 13490, 43, 107, 46, 4327, 71, 101, 252, 3, 1060, 39, 1968, 8, 459, 180, 45, 1, 83, 12, 3768, 1, 3, 617, 1284, 2, 396, 99, 1605, 609, 10, 426, 6, 255, 7, 5, 933, 41, 2, 163, 265, 29, 1024, 14, 4756, 298, 1397, 456, 1409, 3, 9561, 1, 65, 11, 2066, 14, 1759, 6, 1024, 456, 2982, 3, 933, 13490, 43, 10, 2790, 20, 8408, 260, 287, 1137, 7120, 2, 2612, 1766, 1098, 19743, 379, 79, 984, 2719, 60, 28, 43, 17475, 3, 933, 13490, 43, 20, 98, 10, 661, 75, 7668, 320, 29, 4259, 6905, 803, 13639, 1061, 2, 327, 5568, 1045, 332, 1, 933, 41, 163, 30993, 117, 2, 39715, 325, 276, 933, 25885, 3, 7120, 9, 933, 25885, 11, 49, 18, 48, 58, 33, 83, 49, 49, 107, 117, 2, 167, 66, 48, 58, 213, 83, 245, 66, 107, 325, 3, 19743, 11, 203, 18, 379, 79, 984, 17475, 9, 117, 2, 699, 33, 379, 79, 984, 17475, 9, 325, 107, 110, 117, 2, 325, 135, 54, 42, 558, 163, 42, 3, 1076, 933, 13490, 43, 3636, 326, 66, 48, 58, 203, 39, 239, 39, 2, 7815, 493, 49, 379, 79, 984, 17475, 107, 117, 3636, 203, 13, 48, 58, 245, 83, 326, 14, 2, 7815, 713, 33, 379, 79, 984, 17475, 107, 325, 117, 54, 42, 558, 163, 2, 325, 54, 42, 558, 163, 42, 3, 2101, 933, 13490, 43, 3636, 18, 39, 48, 58, 18, 18, 18, 67, 2, 7815, 39, 33, 379, 79, 984, 17475, 107, 117, 3636, 49, 33, 48, 58, 39, 67, 66, 66, 2, 7815, 203, 33, 379, 79, 984, 17475, 107, 325, 110, 117, 2, 325, 54, 42, 558, 933, 41, 163, 1, 500, 11968, 42, 8, 97, 142, 43, 1, 933, 25885, 252, 3, 1060, 39, 1968, 3, 43, 1, 931, 96, 630, 1, 933, 25885, 50, 558, 2, 163, 101, 768, 6, 26, 45, 3, 933, 13490, 43, 107, 332, 1, 933, 41, 163, 16, 93, 7885, 17, 1882, 933, 930, 28, 232, 633, 68, 40, 41, 5, 933, 25885, 46, 272, 47, 3, 174, 6, 2295, 617, 883, 9, 332, 1, 933, 41, 163]",2254.0,30646145,62
