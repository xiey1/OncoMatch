Endometrial stromal sarcoma metastatic to the lung: a detailed analysis of 16 patients.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2002-04-01,"Pulmonary metastases of endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) are uncommon and can pose diagnostic problems. We reviewed lung specimens from 16 patients with metastatic ESS. Patients were 31-77 years of age at the time of lung biopsy. Uterine ESSs were diagnosed an average of 9.8 years before lung biopsy in 11 patients. Uterine ESSs were originally called smooth muscle tumors in three additional patients. Thirteen patients were evaluated for new pulmonary nodules, seven of whom were asymptomatic. Nodules were multiple in 14 and solitary in four, ranging from 1.0 to 8.0 cm in greatest dimension. One patient died of metastatic disease; 14 were alive and seven of these were without disease (mean follow-up 4.1 years). Diagnostic considerations in 12 consultation cases included ESS, sclerosing hemangioma, carcinoid tumor, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, endometriosis, hemangiopericytoma, and lymphoma. Tumors were well circumscribed and usually solid, composed of plump spindle cells arranged in short fascicles. Two tumors were predominantly cystic. Sex cord-like stromal differentiation was identified in three.

Carcinoid tumor of the biliary tract: treating a rare cause of bile duct obstruction.,The American surgeon,Am Surg,2003-02-01,"Biliary carcinoids are rare with fewer than 30 cases reported in the English literature. The objective of this report is to describe an additional patient found to have a biliary carcinoid and to define the presentation, diagnosis, and management of patients with this rare biliary tumor. In our case the patient initially presented with clinical jaundice and elevated transaminases. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiogram established a mass suspicious for cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor). The patient was initially managed with an endostent, which was later removed in favor of a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram tube. At the time of surgery successful removal of a firm nodular mass at the area of the ductal bifurcation was achieved and biliary continuity re-established with a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. Pathology revealed carcinoid tumor of the bile duct with one lymph node positive for tumor. The patient did not receive any adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy. This case serves to highlight that extrahepatic biliary carcinoids constitute a rare but identifiable subset of bile duct tumors. Diagnostic workup should include US, CT, and cholangiography. Surgical exploration is universally indicated in physiologically fit patients with operative management to include resection and re-establishment of biliary continuity. Data on adjuvant therapy remain investigational; however, available information suggests that patients with biliary carcinoid have an overall favorable prognosis after aggressive surgical management.",Case Reports,6198.0,22.0,Biliary carcinoids are rare with fewer than 30 cases reported in the English literature The objective of this report is to describe an additional patient found to have a biliary and to define the presentation diagnosis and management of patients with this rare biliary tumor In our case the patient initially presented with clinical jaundice and elevated transaminases Endoscopic retrograde cholangiogram established a mass suspicious for cholangiocarcinoma Klatskin tumor The patient was initially managed with an endostent which was later removed in favor of a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram tube At the time of surgery successful removal of a firm nodular mass at the area of the ductal bifurcation was achieved and biliary continuity re-established with a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy Pathology revealed tumor of the duct with one lymph node positive for tumor The patient did not receive any adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy This case serves to highlight that extrahepatic biliary carcinoids constitute a rare but identifiable subset of duct tumors Diagnostic workup should include US CT and cholangiography Surgical exploration is universally indicated in physiologically fit patients with operative management to include resection and re-establishment of biliary continuity Data on adjuvant therapy remain investigational however available information suggests that patients with biliary have an overall favorable prognosis after aggressive surgical management,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2532, 9878, 32, 622, 5, 1497, 76, 201, 140, 210, 4, 3, 4201, 789, 3, 461, 1, 26, 414, 16, 6, 897, 35, 402, 69, 204, 6, 47, 8, 2532, 2, 6, 1107, 3, 1031, 147, 2, 284, 1, 7, 5, 26, 622, 2532, 30, 4, 114, 473, 3, 69, 1625, 917, 5, 38, 7655, 2, 804, 9359, 2056, 10583, 28026, 635, 8, 782, 3230, 9, 2126, 33391, 30, 3, 69, 10, 1625, 2231, 5, 35, 53433, 92, 10, 1559, 2264, 4, 4283, 1, 8, 3720, 18865, 28026, 2330, 28, 3, 98, 1, 152, 1401, 2829, 1, 8, 10851, 4481, 782, 28, 3, 965, 1, 3, 1258, 18788, 10, 513, 2, 2532, 12253, 1491, 635, 5, 8, 15881, 4375, 2055, 23202, 1117, 553, 30, 1, 3, 2920, 5, 104, 263, 289, 109, 9, 30, 3, 69, 205, 44, 560, 500, 249, 121, 15, 56, 26, 473, 4711, 6, 1817, 17, 3710, 2532, 9878, 4999, 8, 622, 84, 6237, 697, 1, 2920, 57, 752, 4755, 257, 643, 843, 425, 2, 21954, 221, 3370, 16, 6813, 1103, 4, 9634, 2975, 7, 5, 1208, 284, 6, 643, 170, 2, 1491, 5346, 1, 2532, 12253, 74, 23, 249, 36, 918, 3093, 137, 390, 487, 844, 17, 7, 5, 2532, 47, 35, 63, 913, 356, 50, 571, 221, 284]",1479.0,12641346,114
"Recent advances in the molecular biology, diagnosis and novel therapies for various small blue cell tumors.",Anticancer research,Anticancer Res.,,"Small blue cell tumors are a group of tumors that share a common histologic characteristic with H&E staining. This makes differentiation from one another difficult as they all appear small, blue and round. Even though they all appear the same, they are vastly different from each other. Several different techniques have been developed to help further delineate and classify these tumors which include: small cell lung cancer (SCLC); non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL); Ewing's sarcoma; rhabdomyosarcoma; Merkel carcinoma; neuroblastoma; carcinoid tumors; and intra-abdominal desmpolastic small round cell tumor. Using immunoperoxidase staining, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization techniques, these tumors have been successfully differentiated from one another. This separation makes staging and treatment of these tumors more effective, as not all of these tumors respond to the same modality of treatment.

Hepatic artery embolization and chemoembolization for treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoid tumors: the M.D. Anderson experience.,"Cancer journal (Sudbury, Mass.)",Cancer J,,"Carcinoid tumors have a predilection for metastasizing to the liver. The presence of liver metastases is associated with poor prognosis and also results in significant deterioration of patient's quality of life. Several reports suggest that hepatic artery embolization or chemoembolization can be used for control of liver disease in these patients. We retrospectively reviewed our experience with the use of hepatic arterial embolization or chemoembolization in patients with liver-dominant metastatic carcinoid disease, evaluating the clinical and radiologic response rates, duration of response, and progression-free and overall survival rates of these patients. The medical records of all patients with carcinoid tumors metastatic to the liver who underwent hepatic artery embolization or chemoembolization between January 1992 and December 2000 were reviewed. For the purposes of this study, we compared the follow-up computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging with the baseline imaging to determine each patient's objective tumor response. The interval between the dates of response and disease progression was considered the response duration. Progression-free survival duration was calculated from the date of initial treatment to the date disease progression was recorded or the date of death. Survival durations were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Eighty-one patients (48 men and 33 women; age range, 38-79 years) were included in this study. The mean duration of disease from the initial discovery of liver metastases until embolization was 24.5 months. Fifty patients were treated with bland hepatic artery embolization, and 31 underwent chemoembolization. Of the 69 patients in whom radiologic response could be evaluated, partial response was observed in 46 patients (67%), minimal response (MR) in six (8.7%), stable disease in 11 (16%), and progressive disease in six (8.7%). The median duration of response in the 42 patients with partial response was 17 months (range, 4-51 months). Sixty-three percent of patients had a reduction in their tumor-related symptoms. The median progression-free survival duration was 19 months (95% confidence interval, 17-21 months); the probability of progression-free survival was 75%, 35%, and 11% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively.

Cytotoxic treatment of aggressive prostate tumors with or without neuroendocrine elements.,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",Acta Oncol,2002-01-01,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is an association between the presence of neuroendocrine elements in relapsed prostate cancer and sensitivity to estramustine/etoposide and carboplatin or cisplatin. Thirty patients with progressive metastatic castrate prostate cancer were selected on the basis of clinical criteria for treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy. The criteria included a tumor biopsy specimen taken during relapse showing neuroendocrine features based on morphology alone (carcinoid elements, small cell tumor) or by immunohistochemistry (detection of chromogranin A, neuron-specific enolase or synaptophysin). Patients were treated with cis- or carboplatin, estramustine (orally) and etoposide (orally or intravenously). Remission of radiographically visualized lesions, decline of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or death owing to any cause constituted (separately reported) the endpoints. Tumor remission was found in about half of the patients, determined either by changes in measurable lesions or by a 50% decline in serum PSA. Neuroendocrine elements--irrespective of how they were identified--were not predictive of tumor remission or survival. Regression of measurable lesions by > 50% was seen in 4/9 (44%) cases of small cell carcinoma, 6/13 (46%) of poorly differentiated carcinoma, 7/13 (54%) of tumors with one marker immunohistochemically detected and 3/7 (43%) of tumors without any staining. It is concluded that response to chemotherapy was not predicted solely on the basis of the presence or absence of neuroendocrine elements in a relapsed tumor specimen.

Carcinoid--a comprehensive review.,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",Acta Oncol,2003-01-01,"Carcinoid tumors originate from the neuroendocrine cells throughout the body and are capable of producing various peptides. Their clinical course is often indolent but can also be aggressive and resistant to therapy. We examined all aspects of carcinoid tumors including the molecular biology oncogenesis, role of angiogenesis, recent advances in imaging, and therapy. The Medline and Cancerlit databases were searched using carcinoid as the keyword. English language manuscripts were reviewed and relevant references from a total of 7741 were found. All titles were screened and all the relevant manuscripts were analyzed; we found 307 references pertinent to the history, epidemiology, clinical behavior, pathology, pathophysiology, molecular biology, radiologic imaging, supportive care of carcinoid syndrome, and results of therapeutic clinical trials. Management of patients with carcinoid tumors requires an understanding of the disease process and a multimodality approach. Introduction of long-acting somatostatin analogues has resulted in significant advances in the palliative care of patients with carcinoid syndrome. However, advanced carcinoid tumor remains incurable. Existing therapies for advanced disease have low biologic activity, high toxicity, or both. Clearly, more research is necessary in the areas of molecular biology, targeted therapy, and development of new drugs Future advances in this field need to focus on clinical and biological predictors of outcome.

Outcome of patients with pulmonary carcinoid tumors receiving chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.,"Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",Lung Cancer,2004-05-01,"To determine the outcome of patients with pulmonary typical and atypical carcinoid tumors treated with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. Patients with pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors treated at our institution from 1990 to 2001 were identified. The medical records of patients with diagnoses of typical or atypical pulmonary carcinoids were reviewed for the presence of evaluable disease, treatment with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy, response to these treatments, survival and cause of death. Eighteen patients with typical (n = 8) or atypical (n = 10) pulmonary carcinoid tumors who were treated with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy were identified. Of these, four received chemotherapy plus chest radiotherapy. Three of these had stable disease and one had a partial response. One of the patients with stable disease to chemoradiotherapy subsequently received chemotherapy alone, to which he had a complete response. Fourteen additional patients were treated with 18 chemotherapy regimens. There were two partial responses, eight stable disease, seven progressive disease and one allergic reaction precluding further treatment. The overall response rate to any chemotherapy was 3/15 (20%, 95% CI 0.07-0.45), and the best overall response rate to chemotherapy with or without chest radiotherapy was 4/18 (22%, 95% CI 0.09-0.45).

A phase II study of docetaxel in patients with metastatic carcinoid tumors.,Cancer investigation,Cancer Invest.,2004-01-01,"Twenty-one patients with metastatic carcinoid tumors were treated with docetaxel. Although the treatment was well tolerated, no objective radiologic responses were observed. Novel, more effective agents are needed for this disease. Traditional combination chemotherapy regimens containing streptozocin, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil have yielded disappointing results in patients with metastatic carcinoid tumors. The lack of efficacy of these combinations, together with their toxicity, has led to efforts to investigate therapeutic agents that are potentially more active and tolerable. We, therefore, assessed the efficacy of docetaxel in the treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoid tumors. Twenty-one patients with metastatic carcinoid tumors were treated with docetaxel, administered at a dose of 75 mg/m2 every three weeks. Patients were followed for evidence of toxicity, response, and survival. Docetaxel was well tolerated in this patient population. However, no objective radiologic responses were noted in any of the 21 patients.

"Should patients with advanced, incurable cancers ever be sent home with total parenteral nutrition? A single institution's 20-year experience.",Cancer,Cancer,2005-02-01,"Home total parenteral nutrition (TPN) can be lifesaving and life sustaining for some patients. However, in patients with advanced, incurable cancer, its role is controversial. A retrospective study was conducted to explore whether home TPN was associated with long-term survival (>or=1 year) in patients with metastatic disease and to identify predictive factors to enable its judicious use. The records of all adult patients with incurable cancer were identified between 1979 and 1999. Records were reviewed in depth for survival from TPN initiation to death and for a variety of demographic and clinical factors. Fifty-two patients were identified. Their median age was 56 years (range, 18-83 years), and 30 (58%) were women. Malignant diagnoses included carcinoid/islet cell tumor (n=10), ovarian carcinoma (n=6), amyloidosis/multiple myeloma (n=6), colorectal carcinoma (n=5), sarcoma (n=5), pancreatic carcinoma (n=4), gastric carcinoma (n=3), lymphoma (n=2), pseudomyxoma peritonei (n=2), and other (n=9). TPN was initiated for the following reasons (indications are not mutually exclusive): alimentary tract obstruction (n=20), short bowel syndrome/malabsorption (n=16), fistula (n=11), dysmotility (n=3), nausea/emesis (n=2), anorexia (n=2), and mucositis (n=1). The median time from initiation of TPN to death was 5 months (range, 1-154 months). Sixteen patients survived >or=1 year. TPN-related complications included 18 catheter infections (1 per 2.8 catheter-years), 4 thromboses, 3 pneumothoraces, and 2 episodes of TPN-related liver disease. Tumor grade, the interval between diagnosis of metastatic disease and initiation of TPN, the presence of prominent cancer symptoms, and the administration of cancer therapy after TPN were not associated in any way with overall survival. The initiation of home TPN can be associated with long-term survival in very select patients with incurable cancer, and complication rates with its use appear acceptable. However, the judicious use of home TPN in this setting requires careful clinical assessment on a patient-by-patient basis.",Journal Article,5467.0,84.0,Home total parenteral nutrition TPN can be lifesaving and life sustaining for some patients However in patients with advanced incurable cancer its role is controversial A retrospective study was conducted to explore whether home TPN was associated with long-term survival or=1 year in patients with metastatic disease and to identify predictive factors to enable its judicious use The records of all adult patients with incurable cancer were identified between 1979 and 1999 Records were reviewed in depth for survival from TPN initiation to death and for a variety of demographic and clinical factors Fifty-two patients were identified Their median age was 56 years range 18-83 years and 30 58 were women Malignant diagnoses included carcinoid/islet cell tumor n=10 carcinoma n=6 amyloidosis/multiple n=6 carcinoma n=5 n=5 carcinoma n=4 carcinoma n=3 n=2 pseudomyxoma peritonei n=2 and other n=9 TPN was initiated for the following reasons indications are not mutually exclusive alimentary tract obstruction n=20 short bowel syndrome/malabsorption n=16 fistula n=11 dysmotility n=3 nausea/emesis n=2 anorexia n=2 and mucositis n=1 The median time from initiation of TPN to death was 5 months range 1-154 months Sixteen patients survived or=1 year TPN-related complications included 18 catheter infections 1 per 2.8 catheter-years 4 thromboses 3 pneumothoraces and 2 episodes of TPN-related disease Tumor grade the interval between diagnosis of metastatic disease and initiation of TPN the presence of prominent cancer symptoms and the administration of cancer therapy after TPN were not associated in any way with overall survival The initiation of home TPN can be associated with long-term survival in very select patients with incurable cancer and complication rates with its use appear acceptable However the judicious use of home TPN in this setting requires careful clinical assessment on a patient-by-patient basis,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3249, 181, 8058, 5260, 11997, 122, 40, 27944, 2, 358, 10100, 9, 476, 7, 137, 4, 7, 5, 131, 2641, 12, 211, 200, 16, 2010, 8, 459, 45, 10, 426, 6, 1645, 317, 3249, 11997, 10, 41, 5, 319, 337, 25, 15, 14, 111, 4, 7, 5, 113, 34, 2, 6, 255, 464, 130, 6, 3047, 211, 11764, 119, 3, 1064, 1, 62, 780, 7, 5, 2641, 12, 11, 108, 59, 9444, 2, 2043, 1064, 11, 446, 4, 2436, 9, 25, 29, 11997, 1118, 6, 273, 2, 9, 8, 1362, 1, 1540, 2, 38, 130, 1461, 100, 7, 11, 108, 136, 52, 89, 10, 664, 60, 184, 203, 852, 60, 2, 201, 717, 11, 117, 393, 2403, 159, 26356, 7475, 31, 30, 78, 79, 134, 78, 49, 3919, 232, 78, 49, 134, 78, 33, 78, 33, 134, 78, 39, 134, 78, 27, 78, 18, 23398, 21304, 78, 18, 2, 127, 78, 83, 11997, 10, 1917, 9, 3, 366, 2325, 2406, 32, 44, 5575, 4804, 23102, 1696, 3191, 78, 179, 978, 1659, 681, 30707, 78, 245, 4920, 78, 175, 33792, 78, 27, 1218, 6899, 78, 18, 3373, 78, 18, 2, 2606, 78, 14, 3, 52, 98, 29, 1118, 1, 11997, 6, 273, 10, 33, 53, 184, 14, 4838, 53, 3228, 7, 2996, 15, 14, 111, 11997, 139, 521, 159, 203, 3925, 1875, 14, 379, 18, 66, 3925, 60, 39, 16267, 27, 28332, 2, 18, 3750, 1, 11997, 139, 34, 30, 88, 3, 268, 59, 147, 1, 113, 34, 2, 1118, 1, 11997, 3, 463, 1, 3689, 12, 507, 2, 3, 634, 1, 12, 36, 50, 11997, 11, 44, 41, 4, 500, 2255, 5, 63, 25, 3, 1118, 1, 3249, 11997, 122, 40, 41, 5, 319, 337, 25, 4, 923, 1717, 7, 5, 2641, 12, 2, 1447, 151, 5, 211, 119, 1322, 1595, 137, 3, 11764, 119, 1, 3249, 11997, 4, 26, 546, 1706, 3465, 38, 455, 23, 8, 69, 20, 69, 877]",1921.0,15641035,75
Primary epithelial lung malignancies in the pediatric population.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2005-10-01,"Primary epithelial lung malignancies are rare in childhood and adolescence. We reviewed the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center experience with these tumors to better understand their histology, time to diagnosis, treatment, and outcome. A retrospective review was performed on all patients 21 years of age or younger at diagnosis, treated for primary epithelial lung malignancies at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between 1980 and 2001. We identified 11 patients with primary epithelial lung malignancy. The median age at diagnosis was 19 (range: 12-21) years. The most common radiographic abnormality was a mass (55%) on chest imaging. Seven patients (64%) were initially diagnosed as having pneumonia which contributed to a delay in diagnosis. Final pathologic diagnoses included adenocarcinoma (four), carcinoid tumor (three typical, one atypical), basaloid carcinoma (two), and mucoepidermoid carcinoma (one). A majority of patients presented with advanced disease (two stage III, four stage IV). Patients with localized disease were treated with surgical resection and all but one remains disease free with a median follow-up of 60 months (range: 13-286). Patients with either advanced locoregional or distant metastatic disease were treated with multimodal therapy and a majority had rapid progression of disease. When children and adolescents present with primary epithelial lung malignancy a majority will have advanced disease and experience a delay in diagnosis. The histologic types of tumors encountered are similar to lung tumors occurring in adults, although the frequency of the various types differs. Carcinoid tumors are more frequent, and less common subtypes of bronchogenic carcinoma are also more prevalent in the pediatric age group. Similar to the adult population, the prognosis of these tumors is dependent on histology and stage. Patients with carcinoid tumors seem to have the best prognosis, followed by adenocarcinoma.

Phase II/III study of doxorubicin with fluorouracil compared with streptozocin with fluorouracil or dacarbazine in the treatment of advanced carcinoid tumors: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Study E1281.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2005-08-01,"Optimal treatments for metastatic carcinoid tumor remain undefined, and the role of chemotherapy for symptomatic patients with progressive disease is uncertain. Two hundred forty-nine patients with advanced carcinoid tumors were randomized to either doxorubicin with fluorouracil (FU/DOX) or streptozocin with fluorouracil (FU/STZ). Patients crossed over to the dacarbazine (DTIC) treatment after disease progression following first-line treatment (either FU/DOX or FU/STZ), and 73 patients were assigned to one of these three treatments based on their previous treatment or on abnormal baseline cardiac or renal function. In the randomized group, there was no difference between FU/DOX and FU/STZ in response rates (15.9% v 16%) and progression-free survival (4.5 v 5.3 months). FU/STZ (24.3 months) was superior to FU/DOX (15.7 months; P = .0267) in median survival. The response rate of crossover DTIC treatment was 8.2%, with a median survival of 11.9 months. Hematologic toxicities were the major treatment-related toxicities for both FU/DOX and FU/STZ, and mild to moderate renal toxicity was reported in 40 (34.8%) of 115 patients in the FU/STZ arm.

Hepatic arterial embolization and chemoembolization for the treatment of patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors: variables affecting response rates and survival.,Cancer,Cancer,2005-10-01,"The objective of this study was to determine the prognostic variables that influence response and survival in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors who are treated with hepatic arterial embolization (HAE) or chemoembolization (HACE). Patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors who underwent HAE or HACE were included in this retrospective study. Follow-up imaging studies were compared with baseline imaging to determine the radiologic response. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the prognostic variables that affected response and survival. The study included 69 patients with carcinoid tumors and 54 patients with pancreatic islet cell carcinomas. Patients who had carcinoid tumors had a higher response rate (66.7% vs. 35.2%; P = 0.0001) and had longer PFS (22.7 mos vs. 16.1 mos; P = 0.046) and OS (33.8 mos vs. 23.2 mos; P = 0.012) compared with patients who had islet cell carcinomas. For patients with carcinoid tumors, multivariate analysis identified male gender as the only independent risk factor for poor survival (P = 0.05). Octreotide was predictive marginally for PFS (P = 0.06). Patients who were treated with HAE had a higher response rate than patients who were treated with HACE (P = 0.004). For patients with islet cell carcinoma, an intact primary tumor, > or = 75% liver involvement, and extrahepatic metastases were associated with reduced OS in the univariate analysis; the presence of bone metastases was the only risk factor (P = 0.031) in the multivariate analysis. Patients who were treated with HACE had a prolonged OS (31.5 mos vs. 18.2 mos) and improved response (50% vs. 25%) compared with patients who were treated with HAE, although the differences did not reach statistical significance. Patients with carcinoid tumors had better outcomes than patients with islet cell carcinomas. The addition of intraarterial chemotherapy to HAE did not improve the outcome of patients with carcinoid tumors, but it seemed to benefit patients with islet cell carcinomas. In patients who had carcinoid tumors, male gender predicted a poor outcome, and a trend toward prolonged PFS was observed in patients who received concomitant octreotide. An intact primary tumor, extensive liver disease, and bone metastases were associated with reduced survival in patients with islet cell carcinomas.",Journal Article,5225.0,322.0,The objective of this study was to determine the prognostic variables that influence response and survival in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors who are treated with hepatic arterial embolization HAE or chemoembolization HACE Patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors who underwent HAE or HACE were included in this retrospective study Follow-up imaging studies were compared with baseline imaging to determine the radiologic response Progression-free survival PFS and overall survival OS were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the prognostic variables that affected response and survival The study included 69 patients with tumors and 54 patients with islet cell carcinomas Patients who had tumors had a higher response rate 66.7 vs. 35.2 P 0.0001 and had longer PFS 22.7 mos vs. 16.1 mos P 0.046 and OS 33.8 mos vs. 23.2 mos P 0.012 compared with patients who had islet cell carcinomas For patients with tumors multivariate analysis identified male gender as the only independent risk factor for poor survival P 0.05 Octreotide was predictive marginally for PFS P 0.06 Patients who were treated with HAE had a higher response rate than patients who were treated with HACE P 0.004 For patients with islet cell carcinoma an intact primary tumor or 75 involvement and extrahepatic metastases were associated with reduced OS in the univariate analysis the presence of metastases was the only risk factor P 0.031 in the multivariate analysis Patients who were treated with HACE had a prolonged OS 31.5 mos vs. 18.2 mos and improved response 50 vs. 25 compared with patients who were treated with HAE although the differences did not reach statistical significance Patients with tumors had better outcomes than patients with islet cell carcinomas The addition of intraarterial chemotherapy to HAE did not improve the outcome of patients with tumors but it seemed to benefit patients with islet cell carcinomas In patients who had tumors male gender predicted a poor outcome and a trend toward prolonged PFS was observed in patients who received concomitant octreotide An intact primary tumor extensive disease and metastases were associated with reduced survival in patients with islet cell carcinomas,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 461, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 223, 3, 177, 682, 17, 1054, 51, 2, 25, 4, 7, 5, 113, 1542, 57, 54, 32, 73, 5, 939, 3127, 4232, 17865, 15, 6056, 13635, 7, 5, 113, 1542, 57, 54, 208, 17865, 15, 13635, 11, 159, 4, 26, 459, 45, 166, 126, 270, 94, 11, 72, 5, 330, 270, 6, 223, 3, 2812, 51, 91, 115, 25, 300, 2, 63, 25, 118, 11, 981, 75, 3, 876, 882, 596, 880, 2, 331, 318, 11, 173, 6, 423, 3, 177, 682, 17, 1424, 51, 2, 25, 3, 45, 159, 790, 7, 5, 57, 2, 667, 7, 5, 7475, 31, 826, 7, 54, 42, 57, 42, 8, 142, 51, 116, 700, 67, 105, 465, 18, 19, 13, 488, 2, 42, 589, 300, 350, 67, 5166, 105, 245, 14, 5166, 19, 13, 4902, 2, 118, 466, 66, 5166, 105, 382, 18, 5166, 19, 13, 3499, 72, 5, 7, 54, 42, 7475, 31, 826, 9, 7, 5, 57, 331, 65, 108, 1045, 1632, 22, 3, 158, 306, 43, 161, 9, 334, 25, 19, 13, 474, 4301, 10, 464, 5007, 9, 300, 19, 13, 1460, 7, 54, 11, 73, 5, 17865, 42, 8, 142, 51, 116, 76, 7, 54, 11, 73, 5, 13635, 19, 13, 1520, 9, 7, 5, 7475, 31, 134, 35, 2964, 86, 30, 15, 481, 799, 2, 3710, 196, 11, 41, 5, 405, 118, 4, 3, 880, 65, 3, 463, 1, 196, 10, 3, 158, 43, 161, 19, 13, 5304, 4, 3, 331, 65, 7, 54, 11, 73, 5, 13635, 42, 8, 1069, 118, 456, 33, 5166, 105, 203, 18, 5166, 2, 231, 51, 212, 105, 243, 72, 5, 7, 54, 11, 73, 5, 17865, 242, 3, 362, 205, 44, 3690, 1050, 724, 7, 5, 57, 42, 380, 123, 76, 7, 5, 7475, 31, 826, 3, 352, 1, 17320, 56, 6, 17865, 205, 44, 401, 3, 228, 1, 7, 5, 57, 84, 192, 5025, 6, 247, 7, 5, 7475, 31, 826, 4, 7, 54, 42, 57, 1045, 1632, 783, 8, 334, 228, 2, 8, 853, 1317, 1069, 300, 10, 164, 4, 7, 54, 103, 1781, 4301, 35, 2964, 86, 30, 1344, 34, 2, 196, 11, 41, 5, 405, 25, 4, 7, 5, 7475, 31, 826]",2283.0,16134179,14

Pathol.,2005-12-01,"Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors including pancreatic endocrine tumors and carcinoid tumors are uncommon neoplasms that have site-specific differences in clinicopathological features, clinical course and genetic alterations. The epigenetic alterations in these tumors are not well characterized. We therefore compared methylation of the RAS-association domain family 1, isoform A (RASSF1A), p14, p16 and O6-methyl-guanine methyltransferase genes in neuroendocrine tumors from 47 patients including 16 pancreatic, 15 nonileal and 16 ileal neuroendocrine tumors. Methylation of the RASSF1A gene was present in 57% of tumors, p14 in 49%, p16 in 26% and O6-methyl-guanine methyltransferase in 13% of tumors. Ileal neuroendocrine tumors lacked methylation of O6-methyl-guanine methyltransferase gene (P = 0.04). RASSF1A methylation was associated with histopathologic type of tumors (P = 0.03) and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.004), and p16 methylation with older patient age (P = 0.002) and liver metastasis (P = 0.04).

Contemporary applications of transanal endoscopic microsurgery: technical innovations and limitations.,Clinical colorectal cancer,Clin Colorectal Cancer,2005-11-01,"Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) is a minimally invasive procedure used to transanally excise select benign and malignant tumors of the rectum. In properly selected patients, TEM can provide for decreased postoperative morbidity without compromising oncologic outcome. This report summarizes the recent literature concerning TEM, comprehensively analyzes the authors' experience with TEM, and describes recent technical innovations and indications. Thirty-two consecutive patients scheduled for TEM were identified from our prospectively maintained colorectal service database. Clinicopathologic factors, postoperative complications, and oncologic outcomes were analyzed for all patients. In addition, a PubMed literature search was performed with use of the key words ""transanal endoscopic microsurgery,"" ""TEM,"" ""rectal tumor,"" and ""rectal cancer."" Transanal endoscopic microsurgery was performed for rectal adenocarcinoma (n = 17; 53%), adenoma (n = 12; 38%), and carcinoid tumors (n = 3; 9%). Median tumor location was 9 cm from the anal verge (range, 3-15 cm). Of the 32 attempted TEM procedures, 27 (84%) were completed. Reasons for inability to complete TEM included narrow rectal lumen or contour of bony pelvis prohibiting passage of the operating proctoscope into the upper rectum and inability to maintain the proctoscope in the rectal lumen with carbon dioxide insufflation because of the distal location of the tumor. Innovations used in the excision of rectal tumors via TEM included the use of the harmonic scalpel, closure of the rectal defect with an extracorporeal slip knot, and a hybrid approach incorporating TEM and traditional transanal techniques.

We developed a technique for robotic assistance during video-assisted thoracic surgical lobectomy and report our initial results. Video-assisted thoracic surgical lobectomy with the da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, Calif) was attempted in 34 patients (median age, 69.0 years; age range, 12-85 years). Robotic instruments were used for individual dissection of the hilar structures through 2 thoracoscopic ports and a 4-cm utility incision without rib spreading. Data on patient characteristics and perioperative results were collected prospectively. Robot-assisted video-assisted thoracic surgical lobectomy was accomplished in 30 patients (19 female and 11 male patients). Every type of lobectomy was performed. Four (4/34 [12%]) patients required conversion to thoracotomy. The majority of patients had non-small cell lung cancer (32/34 [94%]), and 1 patient each had a typical carcinoid tumor and an extranodal B-cell lymphoma. Every patient underwent an R0 resection. The median number of lymph node stations dissected with robotic assistance was 4 (range, 2-7). Operative mortality was 0%, with no in-hospital or perioperative deaths. Nine (26%) patients experienced National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 grade 2 or 3 complications.

Primary hepatic neuroendocrine carcinoma: an underdiagnosed entity.,Annals of diagnostic pathology,Ann Diagn Pathol,2006-02-01,"Primary hepatic neuroendocrine tumors are rare. We report a case of a primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the liver with a review of the literature. In earlier reports, all of these tumors were named hepatic carcinoids.

Phase II study of temozolomide and thalidomide in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2006-01-01,"Standard, intravenous chemotherapy regimens for neuroendocrine tumors have been associated with limited response rates and significant toxicity. We evaluated the efficacy of an oral regimen of temozolomide and thalidomide in patients with metastatic carcinoid, pheochromocytoma, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Twenty-nine patients were treated with a combination of temozolomide, administered at a dose of 150 mg/m2 for 7 days, every other week, and thalidomide at doses of 50 to 400 mg daily. Patients were followed for evidence of toxicity, biochemical response, radiologic response, and survival. Treatment with temozolomide and thalidomide was associated with an objective biochemical (chromogranin A) response rate of 40%, and a radiologic response rate of 25% (45% among pancreatic endocrine tumors, 33% among pheochromocytomas, and 7% among carcinoid tumors). The median duration of response was 13.5 months, 1-year survival was 79%, and 2-year survival was 61%. The median administered dose of temozolomide was 150 mg/m(2), and the median administered dose of thalidomide was 100 mg daily. Grade 3-4 toxicities were uncommon, with the exception of grade 3-4 lymphopenia, which developed in 69% of the patient population. Opportunistic infections occurred in three patients (10%) during the time of lymphopenia, and included single cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, disseminated varicella zoster virus, and herpes simplex virus. Orally administered temozolomide and thalidomide seems to be an active regimen for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors.

Selective hepatic artery embolization for treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoid and pancreatic endocrine tumors.,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,Cancer Control,2006-01-01,"Prognosis in patients with carcinoid and pancreatic endocrine tumors with diffuse, unresectable liver metastases is poor. Palliation is often difficult despite the use of somatostatin analogs, interferon alpha, or systemic chemotherapy. Several reviews have suggested that hepatic artery embolization, with or without intraarterial chemotherapy, can be used for control of symptoms and for cytoreduction in patients with liver dominant metastases. Between 2000 and 2002, 161 embolizations using polyvinyl alcohol or microspheres were performed on 84 patients with carcinoid or pancreatic endocrine tumors metastatic to the liver. A retrospective review was performed to evaluate symptomatic response, biochemical response, adverse effects, and duration of survival. Baseline and follow-up computed tomography scans were also assessed to determine radiographic response rates. Further analysis of survival was performed to assess the possible impact of various postembolization therapies. Eighty-four patients underwent bland hepatic artery embolizations during the study period. Among 55 symptomatic patients, 44 patients had fewer symptoms, and among 35 patients whose tumor markers were followed, 28 had a major biochemical response. Objective radiographic responses were observed in 11 of 23 patients. No deaths occurred during therapy, and major toxicities were rare. Median overall survival was 36 months from time of initial embolization. Hepatic artery embolization frequently results in clinical and radiographic responses in patients with unresectable liver metastases from carcinoid or pancreatic endocrine tumors.

We therefore performed a multicenter phase II study of rhEndostatin in patients with carcinoid or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Forty-two patients with advanced pancreatic endocrine tumors or carcinoid tumors were treated with rhEndostatin administered as a bid subcutaneous injection at a starting dose of 60 mg/m2/d.

Patients were observed for evidence of toxicity, response, and survival. rhEndostatin was associated with minimal toxicity. However, among 40 patients assessable for radiologic response, none experienced partial response to therapy, as defined by WHO criteria.

Carcinoid of the rectum risk stratification (CaRRS): a strategy for preoperative outcome assessment.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2006-11-09,"Predicting rectal carcinoid behavior exclusively on the basis of tumor size is imprecise. We sought to identify factors associated with outcome and incorporate them into a preoperative risk stratification scheme. Seventy patients with rectal carcinoid evaluated at our institution were identified. Demographic, clinical, and histopathologic data were collected and correlated with recurrence and survival. The mean age of our cohort was 53.6 years. Fifty-seven percent of patients were women. The mean tumor size was 1.3 cm (range, .1-5 cm). Twenty-five percent of patients had deeply invasive tumors (into the muscularis propria or deeper); an equal percentage had tumors with lymphovascular invasion (LVI) or an increased mitotic rate (two or more mitoses per 50 high-power fields). Eleven patients (17%) had distant metastases at presentation. Sixty-one patients were followed for a median of 22 months (range, 2-308 months), during which seven patients developed recurrence and seven died of disease (including two of seven whose disease recurred). Poor outcome was associated with large tumor size, deep invasion, presence of LVI, and increased mitotic rate.

Cells of the human bronchial carcinoid cell line NCI-H727 and the human pancreatic carcinoid cell line BON-1 were treated with increasing concentrations of imatinib using standard procedures to assess in vitro growth-inhibitory activity. A clinical trial using a two-stage phase II design to assess the response rate and safety profile of imatinib at a dose of 400 mg given twice daily in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors was completed. In both cell lines, there was a dose- and time-dependent cytotoxic effect. The clinical trial enrolled 27 evaluable patients. Median duration on trial was 16 weeks. One patient had a partial response, 17 had stable disease, and 9 had progressive disease by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria. Median progression-free survival time was 24 weeks. Median overall survival is 36 months. Seven patients who achieved a biochemical response had a superior progression-free survival time compared with patients without biochemical response (115 weeks compared with 24 weeks; P = 0.003). An increase in plasma basic fibroblast growth factor was associated with a shorter progression-free survival duration (P = 0.02).

A 52-year-old woman presented with obvious features of Cushing's syndrome. Findings on hormonal evaluation were consistent with EAS. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging revealed normal findings. Computed tomographic imaging disclosed two masses, one in the lung and one in the pancreas. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy showed uptake only in the pancreatic mass, which was surgically removed. It was a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor, with negative immunostaining for ACTH. Hypercortisolemia did not resolve after removal of the pancreatic tumor. The lung mass was subsequently excised, and pathology examination showed a carcinoid tumor with immunostaining for ACTH. Thereafter, plasma ACTH became immeasurable. The two tumors had similar patterns of X-chromosome inactivation; thus, whether they arose independently could be neither confirmed nor excluded.

Carcinoid of the rectum risk stratification (CaRRs): a strategy for preoperative outcome assessment.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2007-02-09,"Predicting rectal carcinoid behavior based exclusively on tumor size is imprecise. We sought to identify factors associated with outcome and incorporate them into a pre-operative risk stratification scheme. Seventy rectal carcinoid patients evaluated at our institution were identified. Demographic, clinical, and histopathologic data were collected and correlated with recurrence and survival. The mean age of our cohort was 53.6 years. Fifty-seven percent of patients were female. The mean tumor size was 1.3 cm (range: 0.1-5 cm). Twenty-five percent of patients had deeply invasive tumors (into the muscularis propria or deeper); an equal percentage had tumors with lymphovascular invasion (LVI) or an elevated mitotic rate (> or =2/50 HPF). Eleven patients (17%) had distant metastases at presentation. Sixty-one patients were followed for a median of 22 months (2-308 months), during which seven patients developed recurrence and seven died of disease (2/7 who developed recurrence). Poor outcome was associated with large tumor size, deep invasion, presence of LVI, and elevated mitotic rate.

Poor prognostic features of rectal carcinoids include: large size, deep invasion, LVI, and elevated mitotic rate. The CaRRS score incorporates these features and accurately predicts outcome.

Elevated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor correlates with increased angiogenesis and decreased progression-free survival among patients with low-grade neuroendocrine tumors.,Cancer,Cancer,2007-04-01,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a critical proangiogenic factor in solid tumors. However, its expression and role in human neuroendocrine tumor development and progression remains unclear. Using immunohistochemistry, VEGF and Sp1 expression patterns were investigated in 50 cases of human gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumor having various clinicopathologic characteristics. It was found that strong VEGF expression was detected in tumor cells, whereas no or very weak VEGF expression was detected in stromal cells surrounding or within the tumors. The levels of VEGF expression directly correlated with the expression levels of Sp1 and microvessel density. Strong, weak, and negative VEGF expression was observed in 32%, 54%, and 14% of cases, respectively. Compared with the group with negative VEGF expression, VEGF (weak/strong) expression was associated with metastasis (14% versus 58%; P = .03). The median progression-free survival (PFS) durations of patients with strong and weak VEGF expression were 29 months and 81 months, respectively. With a median follow-up duration of 50 months, the median PFS duration for the group with negative VEGF expression has not been reached. Compared with the log-rank test, VEGF expression was associated with poor PFS (P = .02). Using in vitro and in vivo models, human carcinoid cell lines were treated with bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF. Bevacizumab did not inhibit the growth of carcinoid cells in vitro but significantly reduced tumor angiogenesis and impaired tumor growth in animals.

Significance of multiple carcinoid tumors and tumorlets in surgical lung specimens: analysis of 28 patients.,Chest,Chest,2007-03-30,"The clinical significance of multiple carcinoid tumorlets in surgical lung specimens has not been systematically analyzed. We reviewed our experience to determine the range of clinical circumstances associated with this finding.

Twenty-eight of 294 patients with a diagnosis of carcinoid tumor or tumorlet had two or more lesions. Twenty-six patients (93%) were women; mean age was 65 years. Patients were categorized into three groups: multiple nodules (n = 17), solitary lung nodules on preoperative imaging (n = 7), and airflow limitation (n = 4). Approximately half of patients with multiple nodules had respiratory complaints; two patients had Cushing syndrome. Ten patients (58.8%) were suspected of having pulmonary metastases, including 7 patients with previously diagnosed malignancies. Intrathoracic lymph node metastases were present in three patients, none of whom had recurrent disease. One patient had a carcinoid tumor resected 8 years later.

Viability of endoscopic and excisional treatment of early rectal carcinoids.,Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,J. Gastrointest. Surg.,2007-07-01,"With the advent of endoscopy, the incidence of rectal carcinoid tumors has not only risen, but the majority are localized at presentation. This has led to excisional and/or ablative therapy in lieu of radical resections. A single institute's experience with rectal carcinoids was reviewed to determine the impact this approach has had on outcomes, and evaluate any selection criteria for optimizing patient survival. A single institute's tumor registry was retrospectively queried, identifying 14 patients with rectal carcinoid tumors over a 28-year period. The mean age at diagnosis was 52.1 +/- 14.4 years. Six of the 14 patients were female. Presenting symptoms included a change in bowel habits in six (38%), rectal bleeding in six (38%), and abdominal pain or distention in five (31%) patients. No patient had symptoms consistent with carcinoid syndrome. The rectal carcinoids were a mean 9.2 +/- 3.4 cm from the anal verge and a mean 9 +/- 6 mm in size.

The scarcity of good gastrointestinal NET models has limited the ability to study potential therapeutic agents. We describe and characterize the establishment of a human midgut carcinoid tumor cell line carcinoid tumor 2 (CNDT2). Tumor cells (CNDT2) were isolated from a liver metastasis from a patient with a primary ileal carcinoid. After 9 weeks in culture, the cells were plated in soft agar, and cells from a single colony were put back in culture (CNDT2.1). Those CNDT2.1 cells were injected s.c. into nude mice. Cells were isolated from a single resultant tumor (CNDT2.5), cultured, and characterized by electron microscopy, reverse transcription-PCR, serotonin enzyme immunoassay, Western blotting, and immunohistochemical analysis for NET markers and potential therapeutic targets. CNDT2 cells grew in monolayers in vitro, formed colonies in soft agar, and formed tumors in mice. Electron microscopy revealed round, pleomorphic, electron-dense neurosecretory granules characteristic of NETs. Tumor xenografts exhibited the appearance of NETs with small ""salt-and-pepper"" nuclei on H&E staining and chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and CD56 on immunohistochemical staining. CNDT2.5 cells produced serotonin and expressed insulin-like growth factor receptor-I, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1, cMET, epidermal growth factor receptor, neuropilin-1, and somatostatin receptors 1 to 5.

Hepatic arterial embolization and chemoembolization in the management of patients with large-volume liver metastases.,Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,Cardiovasc Intervent Radiol,2007-10-06,"The purpose of this study was to assess the role of hepatic arterial embolization (HAE) and chemoembolization (HACE) in patients with large-volume liver metastases. Patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors, melanomas, or gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) with >75% liver involvement who underwent HAE or HACE were included in the study. Radiologic response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and postprocedure complications were assessed. Sixty patients underwent 123 treatment sessions. Of the 48 patients for whom follow-up imaging was available, partial response was seen in 12 (25%) patients, minimal response in 6 (12%), stable disease in 22 (46%), and progressive disease in 8 (17%). Median OS and PFS were 9.3 and 4.9 months, respectively. Treatment resulted in radiologic response or disease stabilization in 82% and symptomatic response in 65% of patients with neuroendocrine tumors. Patients with neuroendocrine tumors had higher response rates (44% vs. 27% and 0%; p = 0.31) and longer PFS (9.2 vs. 2.0 and 2.3 months; p < 0.0001) and OS (17.9 vs. 2.4 and 2.3 months; p < 0.0001) compared to patients with melanomas and GISTs. Major complications occurred in 21 patients after 23 (19%) of the 123 sessions. Nine of the 12 patients who developed major complications resulting in death had additional risk factors--carcinoid heart disease, sepsis, rapidly worsening performance status, or anasarca.

Allelic alterations in well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoid tumors) identified by genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism analysis and comparison with pancreatic endocrine tumors.,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",Genes Chromosomes Cancer,2008-01-01,"Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (WDNT, carcinoid tumors) are uncommon indolent neoplasms. The genetic alterations of these tumors are not well characterized. We used genome-wide high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis to detect copy number alterations in 29 WDNTs, including seven lung, seven nonileal gastrointestinal, and 15 ileal tumors, and compared with allelic imbalances in 15 pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs). Most frequent allelic imbalances in WDNTs were losses of chromosome 18 in 10 tumors (34%), chromosome 21 or 21q in six (21%), chromosome 13 or 13q in five (17%) and chromosome 16 or 16q in four (14%) tumors, and amplification of chromosome 20 or 20p in seven (24%) tumors. We also found one tumor with loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 10 and 15 without copy number loss. These allelic imbalances were associated with primary site of tumor: loss of chromosome 18 was present exclusively in ileal WDNTs (P = 0.001), and loss of chromosome 21 or 21q was more frequent in nonileal gastrointestinal WDNTs (P = 0.02). The tumors with loss of chromosome 21 were larger compared to tumors without loss (P = 0.03). Chromosomal aberrations were less common in WDNTs from lung and gastrointestinal tract compared to PETs (P = 0.001).

Antitumor activity of rapamycin and octreotide as single agents or in combination in neuroendocrine tumors.,Endocrine-related cancer,Endocr. Relat. Cancer,2008-03-01,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway has emerged as a promising target for cancer therapy. Rapamycin inhibits mTOR activity but induces upstream signaling, leading to Akt activation, potentially limiting antitumor activity. Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, decreases phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt signaling in some models, and thus theoretically may enhance rapamycin's antitumor activity. The aim of this study was to determine the antitumor activity of rapamycin and octreotide as single agents and in combination in neuroendocrine tumors. In carcinoid cell lines BON-1 and NCI-H727, cell proliferation was significantly inhibited by rapamycin in vitro, although rapamycin treatment did lead to Akt phosphorylation. Octreotide had limited antiproliferative effects alone, and did not demonstrate synergistic or additive interactions with rapamycin. Furthermore, octreotide did not overcome rapamycin-induced Akt phosphorylation. In vivo, rapamycin alone caused significant tumor suppression. Octreotide alone did not inhibit in vivo tumor growth and did not enhance rapamycin-mediated growth inhibition. In conclusion, rapamycin causes significant growth inhibition in carcinoid tumor cell lines in vitro and in vivo, thus mTOR is a promising therapeutic target for neuroendocrine tumors. Octreotide does not enhance the efficacy of rapamycin's antiproliferative effects in the models tested, and does not inhibit rapamycin-mediated feedback activation of Akt.

At disease progression (PD) or at the end of 18 weeks (whichever occurred earlier), patients received bevacizumab plus PEG interferon until progression. Functional computer tomography (CT) scans were performed to measure effect on tumor blood flow.

Biomarkers Prev.,2008-04-01,"Carcinoids are rare neuroendocrine tumors (NET). Familial clusterings of NETs are rarely reported, except for a small proportion associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 1. We evaluated the effect of positive family history of NET as well as other cancers on the development of NETs arising at five different locations. We conducted a retrospective, hospital-based, case-control study involving 740 patients with histologically confirmed NETs and 924 healthy controls. Information on family history of cancer was collected, and unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to determine adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The authors observed a significant relationship between first-degree relatives with cancers and the development of NETs arising at the small intestine, stomach, lung, and pancreas; AORs (95% CI) were 1.6 (1.1-2.4), 2.5 (1.1-6.3), 2.6 (1.5-4.5), and 1.8 (1.1-3.1), respectively.

We conducted a retrospective, hospital-based, case-control study involving 740 patients with histologically confirmed NETs and 924 healthy controls. Information on different risk factors was collected, and unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to determine adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) by the maximum-likelihood method. Smoking and alcohol consumption were not associated with NETs development in either men or women. However, a family history of cancer was a significant risk factor for all NETs. A long-term history of diabetes mellitus was a significant risk factor for gastric NETs (AOR = 5.6; 95% CI, 2.1-14.5), particularly in women (AOR = 8.4; 95% CI, 1.9-38.1). Diabetes modified the risk among women with a positive family history of cancer for the development of gastric NETs (AOR = 52.2; 95% CI, 5.5-491.5).

Neuroendocrine tumors express vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor (VEGFR). Sunitinib malate, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has activity against VEGFRs as well as platelet-derived growth factor receptors, stem-cell factor receptor, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, and FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3. We evaluated the efficacy of sunitinib in a two-cohort, phase II study of advanced carcinoid and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor patients. Patients were treated with repeated 6-week cycles of oral sunitinib (50 mg/d for 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks off treatment). Patients were observed for response, survival, and adverse events. Patient-reported outcomes were assessed. Among 109 enrolled patients, 107 received sunitinib (carcinoid, n = 41; pancreatic endocrine tumor, n = 66). Overall objective response rate (ORR) in pancreatic endocrine tumor patients was 16.7% (11 of 66 patients), and 68% (45 of 66 patients) had stable disease (SD). Among carcinoid patients, ORR was 2.4% (one of 41 patients), and 83% (34 of 41 patients) had SD.

One-year survival rate was 81.1% in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor patients and 83.4% in carcinoid patients. No significant differences from baseline in patient-reported quality of life or fatigue were observed during treatment.

Pathologic classification and clinical behavior of the spectrum of goblet cell carcinoid tumors of the appendix.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2008-10-01,"Appendiceal tumors exhibiting both neuroendocrine and glandular differentiation are uncommon and have caused difficulty in pathologic classification, prediction of prognosis, and clinical management. Previously, such lesions have been variously designated as adenocarcinoid, goblet cell carcinoid (GCC), and mixed adenocarcinoma carcinoid. In this study, we undertook a retrospective investigation of 63 such cases and classified them as typical GCC (group A) and adenocarcinoma ex GCC on the basis of the histologic features of the tumor at the primary site. The adenocarcinoma ex GCC group was further divided into signet ring cell type (group B) and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma type (group C). The clinical characteristics and prognosis were compared within these groups and with conventional de novo appendiceal adenocarcinomas. Both groups A and B tumors shared a similar immunoprofile, which included generally focal immunoreactivity for neuroendocrine markers, and a normal intestinal type mucin glycoprotein profile (negative MUC1 expression and preserved MUC2 immunoreactivity). The proliferative index was relatively low in these tumors and slightly increased from groups A to B tumors (11% to 16%). Both beta-catenin and E-cadherin exhibited a normal membranous staining pattern in groups A and B tumors. The poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas ex GCC (group C) demonstrated abnormal p53 and beta-catenin immunoreactivity. The mean follow-up time was 49+/-5 (SE) months. The overall disease-specific survival for all subtypes was 77%, with 46% of patients without evidence of disease and 31% alive with disease. The mean survival was 43+/-7 months. All the patients with clinical stage of I or IIA disease had a favorable outcome after appropriate surgery with or without chemotherapy. Although most patients (63%) with GCC presented at an advanced clinical stage, their clinical outcome could be differentiated by subclassification of tumors. The stage IV-matched 5-year survival was 100%, 38%, and 0% for groups A, B, and C, respectively. In conclusion, GCC is a distinctive appendiceal neoplasm that exhibits unique pathologic features and clinical behavior. They display a spectrum of histologic features and possess the potential to transform to an adenocarcinoma phenotype of either signet ring cell or poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma types. Careful evaluation of the morphologic features of GCCs and appropriate pathologic classification are crucial for clinical management and prediction of outcome. Surgical management with right hemicolectomy is recommended after appendectomy for most cases, particularly those with an adenocarcinoma component (groups B and C).",Comparative Study,4129.0,160.0,Appendiceal tumors exhibiting both neuroendocrine and glandular differentiation are uncommon and have caused difficulty in pathologic classification prediction of prognosis and clinical management Previously such lesions have been variously designated as adenocarcinoid goblet cell GCC and mixed adenocarcinoma In this study we undertook a retrospective investigation of 63 such cases and classified them as typical GCC group A and adenocarcinoma ex GCC on the basis of the histologic features of the tumor at the primary site The adenocarcinoma ex GCC group was further divided into signet ring cell type group B and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma type group C The clinical characteristics and prognosis were compared within these groups and with conventional de novo appendiceal adenocarcinomas Both groups A and B tumors shared a similar immunoprofile which included generally focal immunoreactivity for neuroendocrine markers and a normal intestinal type mucin glycoprotein profile negative MUC1 expression and preserved MUC2 immunoreactivity The proliferative index was relatively low in these tumors and slightly increased from groups A to B tumors 11 to 16 Both beta-catenin and E-cadherin exhibited a normal membranous staining pattern in groups A and B tumors The poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas ex GCC group C demonstrated abnormal p53 and beta-catenin immunoreactivity The mean follow-up time was 49+/-5 SE months The overall disease-specific survival for all subtypes was 77 with 46 of patients without evidence of disease and 31 alive with disease The mean survival was 43+/-7 months All the patients with clinical stage of I or IIA disease had a favorable outcome after appropriate surgery with or without chemotherapy Although most patients 63 with GCC presented at an advanced clinical stage their clinical outcome could be differentiated by subclassification of tumors The stage IV-matched 5-year survival was 100 38 and 0 for groups A B and C respectively In conclusion GCC is a distinctive appendiceal neoplasm that exhibits unique pathologic features and clinical behavior They display a spectrum of histologic features and possess the potential to transform to an adenocarcinoma phenotype of either signet ring cell or poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma types Careful evaluation of the morphologic features of GCCs and appropriate pathologic classification are crucial for clinical management and prediction of outcome Surgical management with right hemicolectomy is recommended after appendectomy for most cases particularly those with an adenocarcinoma component groups B and C,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[5708, 57, 4801, 110, 1542, 2, 6170, 910, 32, 2052, 2, 47, 1546, 4035, 4, 510, 947, 1590, 1, 356, 2, 38, 284, 373, 225, 406, 47, 85, 28600, 4107, 22, 45218, 16930, 31, 15725, 2, 1739, 449, 4, 26, 45, 21, 5418, 8, 459, 940, 1, 676, 225, 140, 2, 1373, 1370, 22, 3476, 15725, 87, 8, 2, 449, 2581, 15725, 23, 3, 877, 1, 3, 884, 404, 1, 3, 30, 28, 3, 86, 606, 3, 449, 2581, 15725, 87, 10, 195, 2176, 237, 5489, 4091, 31, 267, 87, 132, 2, 1240, 1442, 449, 267, 87, 256, 3, 38, 374, 2, 356, 11, 72, 262, 46, 271, 2, 5, 809, 1566, 2018, 5708, 1586, 110, 271, 8, 2, 132, 57, 2664, 8, 288, 31332, 92, 159, 1228, 2137, 4900, 9, 1542, 525, 2, 8, 295, 3077, 267, 5258, 4455, 800, 199, 4994, 55, 2, 5797, 17300, 4900, 3, 2441, 558, 10, 1352, 154, 4, 46, 57, 2, 3223, 101, 29, 271, 8, 6, 132, 57, 175, 6, 245, 110, 1090, 1778, 2, 563, 2154, 1416, 8, 295, 6300, 1029, 1177, 4, 271, 8, 2, 132, 57, 3, 1240, 1442, 1586, 2581, 15725, 87, 256, 264, 1668, 624, 2, 1090, 1778, 4900, 3, 313, 166, 126, 98, 10, 739, 33, 3428, 53, 3, 63, 34, 112, 25, 9, 62, 814, 10, 849, 5, 641, 1, 7, 187, 241, 1, 34, 2, 456, 1701, 5, 34, 3, 313, 25, 10, 601, 67, 53, 62, 3, 7, 5, 38, 82, 1, 70, 15, 4088, 34, 42, 8, 913, 228, 50, 870, 152, 5, 15, 187, 56, 242, 96, 7, 676, 5, 15725, 917, 28, 35, 131, 38, 82, 136, 38, 228, 359, 40, 1442, 20, 9341, 1, 57, 3, 82, 478, 655, 33, 111, 25, 10, 394, 519, 2, 13, 9, 271, 8, 132, 2, 256, 106, 4, 1221, 15725, 16, 8, 5049, 5708, 2131, 17, 4273, 991, 510, 404, 2, 38, 1710, 491, 3640, 8, 1873, 1, 884, 404, 2, 5766, 3, 174, 6, 7136, 6, 35, 449, 1005, 1, 361, 5489, 4091, 31, 15, 1240, 1442, 449, 630, 3465, 451, 1, 3, 2815, 404, 1, 57274, 2, 870, 510, 947, 32, 2653, 9, 38, 284, 2, 1590, 1, 228, 221, 284, 5, 1913, 26145, 16, 793, 50, 14590, 9, 96, 140, 823, 135, 5, 35, 449, 1249, 271, 132, 2, 256]",2614.0,18685490,1

The IASLC Lung Cancer Staging Project: proposals for the inclusion of broncho-pulmonary carcinoid tumors in the forthcoming (seventh) edition of the TNM Classification for Lung Cancer.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2008-11-01,"In the 2003 Supplement for tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) Staging classification it states that TNM staging ""applies to all types of carcinoma including small cell carcinoma; however, it does not apply to carcinoids."" Despite this caveat, most publications on typical and atypical carcinoids use the TNM staging system for nonsmall cell carcinoma and are able to demonstrate prognostic significance for the different stages. For this reason, as the next TNM Staging proposal is being considered, we sought to investigate the carcinoid cases submitted to the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) database, as well as the National Cancer Institute Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER). In the data collected for the IASLC Staging Project database over the time period 1990 to 2000, there were 513 broncho-pulmonary carcinoids. A total of 1619 broncho-pulmonary carcinoid cases diagnosed over the period 1990-2002 were analyzed from the SEER database, including 1437 surgical cases. Pathologic slides were not available for histologic review. Most of tumors in both the IASLC and SEER databases were Stage I (82% and 78%, respectively), as defined by the IASLC proposals for the 7th edition of TNM staging system. T status was a statistically significant predictor of survival for both the SEER data (p < 0.0001) and the IASLC database (p = 0.0156), though for different reasons. N status showed significant survival correlations in both data sets (p < 0.0001). The effect of M status was significant (p < 0.0001) within the SEER data and not studied in the IASLC cases, which were almost exclusively M0. We found that all three T, N, and M categories as defined for non-small cell lung cancer are generally useful for staging of pulmonary carcinoid tumors. Significant differences in survival for overall stages I versus II versus III/IV were identified in both data sets. Patients with multiple same lobe nodules had a 100% 5-year survival, which may be a reason to reevaluate their status in the IIB category in future analyses. In summary, the IASLC proposals for the 7th edition of TNM are helpful in predicting prognosis for broncho-pulmonary carcinoid tumors. It is the recommendation of the IASLC Staging project that TNM be applied to broncho-pulmonary carcinoid tumors. A prospective collection of data through an International Registry of Pulmonary Neuroendocrine Tumors planned by the IASLC will allow for further detailed analysis of staging data for broncho-pulmonary carcinoids.",Journal Article,4098.0,197.0,In the 2003 Supplement for tumor node metastasis TNM Staging classification it states that TNM staging `` applies to all types of carcinoma including small cell carcinoma however it does not apply to carcinoids '' Despite this caveat most publications on typical and atypical carcinoids use the TNM staging system for nonsmall cell carcinoma and are able to demonstrate prognostic significance for the different stages For this reason as the next TNM Staging proposal is being considered we sought to investigate the cases submitted to the International Association for the Study of Cancer IASLC database as well as the National Cancer Institute Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER In the data collected for the IASLC Staging Project database over the time period 1990 to 2000 there were 513 broncho-pulmonary carcinoids A total of 1619 broncho-pulmonary cases diagnosed over the period 1990-2002 were analyzed from the SEER database including 1437 surgical cases Pathologic slides were not available for histologic review Most of tumors in both the IASLC and SEER databases were Stage I 82 and 78 respectively as defined by the IASLC proposals for the 7th edition of TNM staging system T status was a statistically significant predictor of survival for both the SEER data p 0.0001 and the IASLC database p 0.0156 though for different reasons N status showed significant survival correlations in both data sets p 0.0001 The effect of M status was significant p 0.0001 within the SEER data and not studied in the IASLC cases which were almost exclusively M0 We found that all three T N and M categories as defined for cell cancer are generally useful for staging of pulmonary tumors Significant differences in survival for overall stages I versus II versus III/IV were identified in both data sets Patients with multiple same lobe nodules had a 100 5-year survival which may be a reason to reevaluate their status in the IIB category in future analyses In summary the IASLC proposals for the 7th edition of TNM are helpful in predicting prognosis for broncho-pulmonary tumors It is the recommendation of the IASLC Staging project that TNM be applied to broncho-pulmonary tumors A prospective collection of data through an International Registry of Pulmonary Neuroendocrine Tumors planned by the IASLC will allow for further detailed analysis of staging data for broncho-pulmonary carcinoids,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4, 3, 1522, 5836, 9, 30, 289, 278, 2918, 632, 947, 192, 907, 17, 2918, 632, 11492, 6, 62, 630, 1, 134, 141, 302, 31, 134, 137, 192, 1097, 44, 4930, 6, 9878, 522, 550, 26, 23559, 96, 4463, 23, 3476, 2, 1973, 9878, 119, 3, 2918, 632, 398, 9, 5667, 31, 134, 2, 32, 1665, 6, 608, 177, 724, 9, 3, 338, 1153, 9, 26, 3852, 22, 3, 1305, 2918, 632, 13383, 16, 486, 515, 21, 990, 6, 963, 3, 140, 5118, 6, 3, 944, 248, 9, 3, 45, 1, 12, 6955, 609, 22, 149, 22, 3, 657, 12, 1377, 617, 1284, 2, 396, 99, 1605, 4, 3, 74, 786, 9, 3, 6955, 632, 3105, 609, 252, 3, 98, 727, 2289, 6, 1081, 125, 11, 11895, 25126, 1087, 9878, 8, 181, 1, 38805, 25126, 1087, 140, 265, 252, 3, 727, 2289, 1544, 11, 311, 29, 3, 1605, 609, 141, 57470, 221, 140, 510, 3830, 11, 44, 390, 9, 884, 206, 96, 1, 57, 4, 110, 3, 6955, 2, 1605, 2348, 11, 82, 70, 878, 2, 833, 106, 22, 395, 20, 3, 6955, 11913, 9, 3, 7283, 3580, 1, 2918, 632, 398, 102, 156, 10, 8, 712, 93, 980, 1, 25, 9, 110, 3, 1605, 74, 19, 13, 488, 2, 3, 6955, 609, 19, 13, 33312, 2471, 9, 338, 2325, 78, 156, 224, 93, 25, 2553, 4, 110, 74, 2270, 19, 13, 488, 3, 254, 1, 188, 156, 10, 93, 19, 13, 488, 262, 3, 1605, 74, 2, 44, 656, 4, 3, 6955, 140, 92, 11, 2214, 4437, 4591, 21, 204, 17, 62, 169, 102, 78, 2, 188, 1996, 22, 395, 9, 31, 12, 32, 1228, 999, 9, 632, 1, 1087, 57, 93, 362, 4, 25, 9, 63, 1153, 70, 185, 215, 185, 316, 478, 11, 108, 4, 110, 74, 2270, 7, 5, 232, 827, 4940, 2597, 42, 8, 394, 33, 111, 25, 92, 68, 40, 8, 3852, 6, 19087, 136, 156, 4, 3, 3884, 2169, 4, 508, 318, 4, 1962, 3, 6955, 11913, 9, 3, 7283, 3580, 1, 2918, 32, 3951, 4, 1434, 356, 9, 25126, 1087, 57, 192, 16, 3, 3347, 1, 3, 6955, 632, 3105, 17, 2918, 40, 1498, 6, 25126, 1087, 57, 8, 482, 2442, 1, 74, 298, 35, 944, 1608, 1, 1087, 1542, 57, 1465, 20, 3, 6955, 303, 1700, 9, 195, 2455, 65, 1, 632, 74, 9, 25126, 1087, 9878]",2400.0,18978555,58
Anatomy of the superior mesenteric vein with special reference to the surgical management of first-order branch involvement at pancreaticoduodenectomy.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2008-12-01,"To describe our approach to resection of pancreatic head cancers, which involve 1 or both of the first-order branches of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV). In contrast to tumors which involve the proximal SMV, cancers in the inferior aspect of the pancreatic head or root of mesentery (mid gut carcinoid) may involve one of the 2 primary branches of the SMV (the ileal and jejunal branches), with or without involvement of the main trunk of the SMV. Such cases are associated with significant technical challenges. Our surgical approach is described and illustrated. Isolated involvement of the jejunal branch of the SMV may be managed by division of this branch without reconstruction as long as the ileal branch is intact and of good caliber. Tumors which involve the ileal branch of the SMV, in the rare setting in which the jejunal branch is preserved, may also be managed by ligation and resection without reconstruction.

O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase deficiency and response to temozolomide-based therapy in patients with neuroendocrine tumors.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2009-01-01,"Recent studies suggest that temozolomide has activity in neuroendocrine tumors. Low levels of the DNA repair enzyme, O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), are associated with sensitivity to temozolomide in other tumor types. We evaluated the prevalence of MGMT deficiency in neuroendocrine tumors and correlated MGMT deficiency with treatment response to temozolomide-based regimens. The prevalence of MGMT deficiency, measured by immunohistochemistry, was assessed in 97 archival neuroendocrine tumor specimens. Rates of treatment response and survival were next evaluated in a cohort of 101 consecutive neuroendocrine tumor patients who had received treatment with a temozolomide-based regimen at one of three institutions. MGMT expression was directly correlated with treatment response in 21 patients who had available tumor tissue and response data. In archival specimens, MGMT deficiency was observed in 19 of 37 (51%) pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and 0 of 60 (0%) carcinoid tumors (P < 0.0001). In the clinical cohort, 18 of 53 (34%) patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors but only 1 of 44 (2%) patients with carcinoid tumors (P < 0.001) experienced a partial or complete response to temozolomide-based therapy. Among 21 patients with evaluable tumor tissue who had also received treatment with temozolomide, 4 of 5 patients with MGMT-deficient tumors (all pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors) and 0 of 16 patients with tumors showing intact MGMT expression responded to treatment (P = 0.001).

PAX5 is expressed in small-cell lung cancer and positively regulates c-Met transcription.,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,Lab. Invest.,2009-01-12,"PAX5 is a nuclear transcription factor required for B cell development, and its expression was evaluated in upper aerodigestive malignancies and pancreatic cancer by immunoblotting. The PAX5 protein expression was relatively strong in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC, 11/12); however, its expression was not detected in non-SCLC (NSCLC, n=13), mesothelioma (n=7), pancreatic (n=6), esophageal (n=6) and head and neck cancer cell lines (n=12). In comparison, PAX8 and PAX3 expressions were absent or non-detectable in SCLC cell lines; however, PAX8 was expressed in most of the tested NSCLC cell lines (13/13) and also frequently in all the other cell lines. We also detected frequent expressions of PAX2 and PAX9 protein in the various cell lines. Utilizing neuroendocrine tumor samples, we found that the frequency as well as the average intensity of the expression of PAX5 increased from pulmonary carcinoid (9%, moderate and strong PAX5 expression, n=44), to large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNC, 27%, n=11) to SCLC (33%, n=76). FISH analysis revealed no translocations of the PAX5 gene, but polyploidy in some SCLC tumor tissues (6/37). We determined that PAX5 could regulate the transcription of c-Met using luciferase-coupled reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. In addition, the phospho-c-Met (active form) and PAX5 were both localized to the same intra-nuclear compartment in hepatocyte growth factor treated SCLC cells and interacted with each other. Finally, we determined the therapeutic translational potential of PAX5 using PAX5 knockdown SCLC cells in conjunction with Topoisomerase 1 (SN38) and c-Met (SU11274) inhibitors. Loss of endogenous PAX5 significantly decreased the viability of SCLC cells, especially when combined with SN38 or SU11274, and maximum effect was seen when both inhibitors were used. Therefore, we propose that PAX5 could be an important regulator of c-Met transcription and a potential target for therapy in SCLC.",Journal Article,4026.0,67.0,PAX5 is a nuclear transcription factor required for B cell development and its expression was evaluated in upper aerodigestive malignancies and cancer by immunoblotting The PAX5 protein expression was relatively strong in small-cell cancer SCLC 11/12 however its expression was not detected in non-SCLC NSCLC n=13 n=7 n=6 n=6 and head and cancer cell lines n=12 In comparison PAX8 and PAX3 expressions were absent or non-detectable in SCLC cell lines however PAX8 was expressed in most of the tested NSCLC cell lines 13/13 and also frequently in all the other cell lines We also detected frequent expressions of PAX2 and PAX9 protein in the various cell lines Utilizing neuroendocrine tumor samples we found that the frequency as well as the average intensity of the expression of PAX5 increased from pulmonary 9 moderate and strong PAX5 expression n=44 to large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma LCNC 27 n=11 to SCLC 33 n=76 FISH analysis revealed no translocations of the PAX5 gene but polyploidy in some SCLC tumor tissues 6/37 We determined that PAX5 could regulate the transcription of c-Met using luciferase-coupled reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis In addition the phospho-c-Met active form and PAX5 were both localized to the same intra-nuclear compartment in growth factor treated SCLC cells and interacted with each other Finally we determined the therapeutic translational potential of PAX5 using PAX5 knockdown SCLC cells in conjunction with Topoisomerase 1 SN38 and c-Met SU11274 inhibitors Loss of endogenous PAX5 significantly decreased the viability of SCLC cells especially when combined with SN38 or SU11274 and maximum effect was seen when both inhibitors were used Therefore we propose that PAX5 could be an important regulator of c-Met transcription and a potential target for therapy in SCLC,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"[6279, 16, 8, 928, 866, 161, 616, 9, 132, 31, 193, 2, 211, 55, 10, 194, 4, 1726, 11006, 441, 2, 12, 20, 5293, 3, 6279, 178, 55, 10, 1352, 1082, 4, 302, 31, 12, 1334, 175, 133, 137, 211, 55, 10, 44, 530, 4, 220, 1334, 304, 78, 233, 78, 67, 78, 49, 78, 49, 2, 718, 2, 12, 31, 285, 78, 133, 4, 1155, 8958, 2, 8424, 4249, 11, 3269, 15, 220, 2083, 4, 1334, 31, 285, 137, 8958, 10, 570, 4, 96, 1, 3, 650, 304, 31, 285, 233, 233, 2, 120, 746, 4, 62, 3, 127, 31, 285, 21, 120, 530, 908, 4249, 1, 15730, 2, 45395, 178, 4, 3, 747, 31, 285, 2600, 1542, 30, 347, 21, 204, 17, 3, 675, 22, 149, 22, 3, 1011, 837, 1, 3, 55, 1, 6279, 101, 29, 1087, 83, 1163, 2, 1082, 6279, 55, 78, 584, 6, 375, 31, 1542, 134, 45396, 428, 78, 175, 6, 1334, 466, 78, 846, 1277, 65, 553, 77, 3262, 1, 3, 6279, 145, 84, 24874, 4, 476, 1334, 30, 742, 49, 567, 21, 509, 17, 6279, 359, 2288, 3, 866, 1, 256, 543, 75, 3864, 3332, 3674, 2, 2287, 4857, 65, 4, 352, 3, 3125, 256, 543, 544, 1297, 2, 6279, 11, 110, 909, 6, 3, 827, 2392, 928, 3616, 4, 129, 161, 73, 1334, 37, 2, 7940, 5, 296, 127, 1368, 21, 509, 3, 189, 2460, 174, 1, 6279, 75, 6279, 1563, 1334, 37, 4, 3357, 5, 3999, 14, 10557, 2, 256, 543, 11496, 222, 407, 1, 2682, 6279, 97, 340, 3, 2120, 1, 1334, 37, 1093, 198, 397, 5, 10557, 15, 11496, 2, 689, 254, 10, 527, 198, 110, 222, 11, 95, 673, 21, 2548, 17, 6279, 359, 40, 35, 305, 2452, 1, 256, 543, 866, 2, 8, 174, 283, 9, 36, 4, 1334]",1827.0,19139719,114

Surgical management of hepatic neuroendocrine tumor metastasis: results from an international multi-institutional analysis.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2010-06-29,"Management of neuroendocrine tumor liver metastasis (NELM) remains controversial, with some advocating an aggressive surgical approach while others have adopted a more conservative strategy. We sought to define the efficacy of the surgical management of NELM in a large multicenter international cohort of patients. We identified 339 patients who underwent surgical management for NELM from 1985 to 2009 from an international database of eight major hepatobiliary centers. Relevant clinicopathologic data were assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models. Most patients had a pancreatic (40%) or small bowel (25%) neuroendocrine tumor (NET) primary. The majority of patients (60%) had bilateral liver disease. At surgery, 78% of patients underwent hepatic resection, 3% ablation alone, and 19% resection + ablation. Major hepatectomy was performed in 45% of patients, and 14% underwent a second liver operation. Carcinoid was the most common NET histological subtype (53%). Median survival was 125 months, with overall 5- and 10-year survival of 74%, and 51%, respectively. Disease recurred in 94% of patients at 5 years. Patients with hormonally functional NET who had R0/R1 resection benefited the most from surgery (P = 0.01).

"Expression patterns of PAX5, c-Met, and paxillin in neuroendocrine tumors of the lung.",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med.,2010-11-01,"c-Met is important in the pathogenesis, invasion, and spread of several forms of lung cancer, and multiple c-Met inhibitors are undergoing clinical trials. PAX5 has been shown to upregulate c-Met in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), and coinhibiting PAX5 and c-Met had a synergic effect in killing tumor cells. Paxillin is a downstream target of activated c-Met, and its activation leads to enhanced cell motility and tumor spread. The expression patterns of these functionally related proteins have not, to our knowledge, been systemically studied in neuroendocrine tumors of the lung. To investigate the expression patterns of PAX5, paxillin, c-Met, and phosphorylated c-Met in 4 categories of pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors. Tissue microarrays of 38 typical carcinoids, 6 atypical carcinoids, 34 SCLCs, and 11 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas were studied with immunohistochemistry. Most of the 4 tumor types expressed c-Met, phosphorylated c-Met, and paxillin. PAX5 was frequently expressed in atypical carcinoids, SCLCs, and large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas but tended to be negative in typical carcinoids. Coexpression of PAX5 with c-Met or phosphorylated c-Met was present in most of the atypical carcinoids, SCLCs, and large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas.

Relat. Cancer,2011-01-13,"Genetic studies of midgut carcinoid cancer have exclusively focused on genomic changes of the tumor cells. We investigated the role of constitutional genetic polymorphisms in predisposing individuals to ileal carcinoids. In all, 239 cases and 110 controls were collected from three institutions: the Uppsala University Hospital; the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; and the MD Anderson Cancer Center, and were genotyped using microarrays assaying >300 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Association with rs2208059 in KIF16B approached statistical significance (Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio=2.42, P=4.16×10(-7)) at a Bonferroni-corrected level (<1.62×10(-7)). Using two computational algorithms, four copy-number variants (CNVs) were identified in multiple cases that were absent in study controls and markedly less frequent in ∼1500 population-based controls. Of these four constitutional CNVs identified in blood-derived DNA, a 40 kb heterozygous deletion in Chr18q22.1 corresponded with a region frequently showing loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in ileal carcinoid tumor cells based on our meta-analysis of previously published cytogenetic studies (69.7% LOH, 95% confidence interval=60.0-77.9%). We analyzed the constitutional 40 kb deletion on chr18 in our study samples with a real-time quantitative PCR assay; 14/226 cases (6.19%) and 2/97 controls (2.06%) carried the CNV, although the exact boundaries of each deletion have not been determined.

Clin. Oncol.,2011-01-31,"Resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis represents a major obstacle to cancer control. Overexpression of Bcl-2 is seen in multiple tumor types and targeting Bcl-2 may provide therapeutic benefit. A phase I study of navitoclax, a novel inhibitor of Bcl-2 family proteins, was conducted to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy in patients with solid tumors. Patients enrolled to intermittent dosing cohorts received navitoclax on day -3, followed by dosing on days 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle. Patients on continuous dosing received a 1-week lead-in dose of 150 mg followed by continuous daily administration. Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analyses, biomarker analyses, and platelet monitoring. Forty-seven patients, including 29 with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) or pulmonary carcinoid, were enrolled between 2007 and 2008, 35 on intermittent and 12 on continuous dosing cohorts. Primary toxicities included diarrhea (40%), nausea (34%), vomiting (36%), and fatigue (34%); most were grade 1 or 2. Dose- and schedule-dependent thrombocytopenia was seen in all patients. One patient with SCLC had a confirmed partial response lasting longer than 2 years, and eight patients with SCLC or carcinoid had stable disease (one remained on study for 13 months).

Perfusion CT findings in patients with metastatic carcinoid tumors undergoing bevacizumab and interferon therapy.,AJR. American journal of roentgenology,AJR Am J Roentgenol,2011-03-01,"The purpose of this article is to assess tumor changes on perfusion CT with bevacizumab and interferon (IFN) therapy in patients with metastatic carcinoid tumors and to evaluate perfusion CT differences between the two therapies. In a phase 2 clinical trial, 44 patients were randomized to receive monotherapy with bevacizumab or IFN for 18 weeks (stage 1), followed by dual-therapy with both drugs (stage 2). Twenty-four patients consented to have optional perfusion CT examinations, which were undertaken at baseline and 18 weeks and at intervening 2 days (bevacizumab arm) or 9 weeks (IFN arm), and subsequently at 2 days after the addition of bevacizumab (IFN arm) and 9 weeks after the addition of IFN (bevacizumab arm). Tumor blood flow, blood volume, and permeability were evaluated. In the bevacizumab arm (n = 12), mean (± SD) blood flow reduced significantly after 2 days compared with baseline (16.2 ± 6.9 vs 32.3 ± 21.3 mL/min/100 g; p = 0.02), a 41.4% reduction (p < 0.0001) that was relatively fixed. Blood volume was similarly reduced from baseline values (2.8 ± 1.3 vs 4.3 ± 2.1 mL/100 g; p = 0.02), a 27.9% reduction (p < 0.02). Both measures remained essentially unchanged at 18 weeks. Similar changes in blood flow and blood volume were observed with the addition of bevacizumab in stage 2. No significant changes in blood flow or blood volume were detected in the IFN arm (n = 12), and no significant changes in permeability were detected in either arm. Perfusion CT detects significant changes in perfusion parameters in metastatic carcinoid tumors treated with bevacizumab. Such changes are apparent just 2 days into therapy, are sustained, and are significantly different from those associated with IFN treatment.

A preclinical and clinical study of lithium in low-grade neuroendocrine tumors.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2011-03-10,"Low-grade neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) respond poorly to chemotherapy; effective, less toxic therapies are needed. Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β has been shown to regulate growth and hormone production in NETs. Use of lithium chloride in murine models suppressed carcinoid cell growth, reduced GSK-3β levels, and reduced expression of chromogranin A. This study assessed the efficacy of lithium chloride in patients with NETs. Eligible patients had low-grade NETs. A single-arm, open-label phase II design was used. Lithium was dosed at 300 mg orally three times daily, titrated to serum levels of 0.8-1.0 mmol/L. The primary endpoint was objective tumor response by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, progression-free survival, GSK-3β phosphorylation, and toxicity. Fifteen patients were enrolled between October 3, 2007 and July 17, 2008, six men and nine women. The median age was 58 years. Patient diagnoses were carcinoid tumor for eight patients, islet cell tumor for five patients, and two unknown primary sites. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status scores were 0 or 1. Two patients came off study because of side effects. The median progression-free survival interval was 4.50 months. There were no radiographic responses. Because of an early stopping rule requiring at least one objective response in the first 13 evaluable patients, the study was closed to further accrual. Patients had pre- and post-therapy biopsies. Lithium chloride was ineffective at obtaining radiographic responses in our 13 patients who were treated as part of this study. Based on the pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies, lithium did not potently inhibit GSK-3β at serum levels used to treat bipolar disorders.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",3239.0,13.0,Low-grade neuroendocrine tumors NETs respond poorly to chemotherapy effective less toxic therapies are needed Glycogen synthase kinase GSK -3β has been shown to regulate growth and hormone production in NETs Use of lithium chloride in murine models suppressed cell growth reduced GSK-3β levels and reduced expression of chromogranin A This study assessed the efficacy of lithium chloride in patients with NETs Eligible patients had low-grade NETs A single-arm open-label phase II design was used Lithium was dosed at 300 mg orally three times daily titrated to serum levels of 0.8-1.0 mmol/L The primary endpoint was objective tumor response by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Secondary endpoints included overall survival progression-free survival GSK-3β phosphorylation and toxicity Fifteen patients were enrolled between October 3 2007 and July 17 2008 six men and nine women The median age was 58 years Patient diagnoses were tumor for eight patients islet cell tumor for five patients and two unknown primary sites Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status scores were 0 or 1 Two patients came off study because of side effects The median progression-free survival interval was 4.50 months There were no radiographic responses Because of an early stopping rule requiring at least one objective response in the first 13 evaluable patients the study was closed to further accrual Patients had pre- and post-therapy biopsies Lithium chloride was ineffective at obtaining radiographic responses in our 13 patients who were treated as part of this study Based on the pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies lithium did not potently inhibit GSK-3β at serum levels used to treat bipolar disorders,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[154, 88, 1542, 57, 2883, 1892, 1240, 6, 56, 323, 299, 1812, 235, 32, 575, 9482, 3522, 216, 8463, 10505, 71, 85, 443, 6, 2288, 129, 2, 785, 1529, 4, 2883, 119, 1, 18338, 12086, 4, 1471, 274, 1908, 31, 129, 405, 8463, 10505, 148, 2, 405, 55, 1, 8931, 8, 26, 45, 275, 3, 209, 1, 18338, 12086, 4, 7, 5, 2883, 625, 7, 42, 154, 88, 2883, 8, 226, 475, 1020, 1756, 124, 215, 771, 10, 95, 18338, 10, 6268, 28, 2036, 81, 1428, 169, 1072, 391, 15875, 6, 524, 148, 1, 13, 66, 14, 13, 10645, 805, 3, 86, 1138, 10, 461, 30, 51, 20, 3, 51, 451, 371, 4, 537, 57, 568, 1387, 159, 63, 25, 91, 115, 25, 8463, 10505, 982, 2, 155, 3057, 7, 11, 346, 59, 2551, 27, 1307, 2, 2066, 269, 1375, 437, 325, 2, 762, 117, 3, 52, 89, 10, 717, 60, 69, 2403, 11, 30, 9, 659, 7, 7475, 31, 30, 9, 365, 7, 2, 100, 860, 86, 633, 2118, 1690, 413, 87, 528, 156, 703, 11, 13, 15, 14, 100, 7, 8594, 1889, 45, 408, 1, 1152, 176, 3, 52, 91, 115, 25, 268, 10, 39, 212, 53, 125, 11, 77, 1580, 253, 408, 1, 35, 191, 6811, 5340, 1888, 28, 506, 104, 461, 51, 4, 3, 157, 233, 859, 7, 3, 45, 10, 3745, 6, 195, 2262, 7, 42, 671, 2, 539, 36, 1154, 18338, 12086, 10, 3957, 28, 5244, 1580, 253, 4, 114, 233, 7, 54, 11, 73, 22, 760, 1, 26, 45, 90, 23, 3, 671, 2, 539, 24, 30, 1154, 18338, 205, 44, 4684, 1433, 8463, 10505, 28, 524, 148, 95, 6, 943, 20643, 1997]",1722.0,21393344,72

In the September issue of Endocrine-Related Cancer, Zatelli et al. reported an anti-proliferative effect of mTOR inhibitor, everolimus, in cultured primary BC tumor cells by attenuation of IGF signaling pathway. This effect is more significant in aggressive tumors that carry higher levels of mTOR, and is consistent with the therapeutic benefit of everolimus for patients with BC observed in our phase II and III clinical trials.

New treatment options for patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors.,Current treatment options in oncology,Curr Treat Options Oncol,2011-06-01,"Well- to moderately differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies for which a range of therapeutic options have been employed. For patients with localized NET, surgical resection remains the mainstay of treatment. Surgical resection of hepatic metastases or hepatic artery embolization may also be beneficial in patients with hepatic-predominant metastatic disease. Symptoms of hormonal excess, such as carcinoid syndrome and syndromes associated with functional pancreatic NET, can be effectively treated with somatostatin analogs. Systemic treatment options for patients with advanced NET have been limited. Treatment with the somatostatin analog octreotide has been shown to improve progression-free survival in patients with advanced midgut carcinoid tumors, and the potential antiproliferative effect of somatostatin analogs in patients with other NET subtypes is currently under investigation. Patients with advanced pancreatic NET may also respond to treatment with streptozocin or temozolomide-based therapy. In patients with advanced pancreatic NET, randomized, placebo-controlled studies have recently demonstrated that treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib or with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus is associated with improved progression-free survival.

Advantages over transanal excision include better visualization, access to more proximal lesions, higher likelihood of negative margins, and lower recurrence rates. Compared to radical resection, patients experience lower rates of morbidity and mortality but may have higher rates of local recurrence. A review of a prospectively maintained database of patients scheduled for transanal endoscopic microsurgery was performed. Ninety-three patients underwent 96 procedures for 13 carcinoid tumors, 1 submucosal mass, 46 adenomas, 12 in situ adenocarcinomas, and 21 invasive adenocarcinomas. Of these cases, 81.2% was successfully completed. There were nine complications (11.5%). Final pathology demonstrated 33 in situ and invasive adenocarcinomas. The mean follow-up was 25.9 months. The four recurrences (12.1%) occurred in: one tubulovillous adenoma, two in situ carcinomas, and one T2 lesion.

A pilot phase II study of valproic acid for treatment of low-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2011-05-31,"Notch1 has been shown to be a tumor suppressor in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Previous in vitro studies in NET cell lines have also suggested that valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, can induce Notch1 and that Notch1 activation correlates with a decrease in tumor markers for NETs. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the role of VPA in treating NETs and to determine whether VPA induced the Notch signaling pathway signaling in vivo. Eight patients with low-grade NETs (carcinoid and pancreatic) were treated with 500 mg of oral VPA twice a day with dosing adjusted to maintain a goal VPA level between 50 and 100 μg/mL. All patients were followed for 12 months or until disease progression. Notch1 signaling was absent in all tumors prior to treatment and was upregulated with VPA. One patient had an unconfirmed partial response and was noted to have a 40-fold increase in Notch1 mRNA levels. Four patients had stable disease as best response. Tumor markers improved in 5 out of 7 patients. Overall, treatment with VPA was well tolerated. .

Identification of cancer stem cells in human gastrointestinal carcinoid and neuroendocrine tumors.,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,2011-07-30,"Metastatic gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) frequently are refractory to chemotherapy. Chemoresistance in various malignancies has been attributed to cancer stem cells (CSCs). We sought to identify gastrointestinal neuroendocrine CSCs (N-CSCs) in surgical specimens and a NET cell line and to characterize novel N-CSC therapeutic targets. Human gastrointestinal NETs were evaluated for CSCs using the Aldefluor (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) assay. An in vitro, sphere-forming assay was performed on primary NET cells. CNDT2.5, a human midgut carcinoid cell line, was used for in vitro (sphere-formation) and in vivo (tumorigenicity assays) CSC studies. N-CSC protein expression was characterized using Western blotting. In vivo, systemic short interfering RNA administration targeted Src. By using the Aldefluor assay, aldehyde dehydrogenase-positive (ALDH+) cells comprised 5.8% ± 1.4% (mean ± standard error of the mean) of cells from 19 patient samples. Although many primary cell lines failed to grow, CNDT96 ALDH+ cells formed spheres in anchorage-independent conditions, whereas ALDH- cells did not. CNDT2.5 ALDH+ cells formed spheres, whereas ALDH- cells did not. In vivo, ALDH+ CNDT2.5 cells generated more tumors, with shorter latency than ALDH- or sham-sorted cells. Compared with non-CSCs, ALDH+ cells demonstrated increased expression of activated Src, Erk, Akt, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In vivo, anti-Src short interfering RNA treatment of ALDH+ tumors reduced tumor mass by 91%. CSCs are present in NETs, as shown by in vitro sphere formation and in vivo tumorigenicity assays.

Survival impact of malignant pancreatic neuroendocrine and islet cell neoplasm phenotypes.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2011-10-17,"The low incidence of malignant ""functional"" (F) or ""nonfunctional"" (NF) neuroendocrine islet cell tumors (ICTs) of the pancreas represents a challenge to precise post-therapeutic survival prediction. This study examined the survival impact of malignant pancreatic ICT morphologic subtypes. A pancreatic ICT data set was created from a US-based population database from 1980-2004. Prognostic factors with survival impact and relationships between surgical therapy and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. There were 2,350 individuals with malignant ICTs. Histologic subtypes included carcinoid tumors, islet cell carcinomas, neuroendocrine carcinomas, and malignant gastrinomas, insulinomas, glucagonomas, or VIPomas. There was no difference in resection rates between FICTs and NFICTs (23% vs. 20%, P = ns). Median OS was 30 months, with group differences ranging from NE carcinomas (21) to VIPomas (96; P < 0.0001). Median OS of resected versus unresected FICTs was 172 versus 37 months, while that of NFICTs was 113 versus 18 months (P < 0.0001).

"A phase 2 study of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor inhibitor MK-0646 in patients with metastatic, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors.",Cancer,Cancer,2012-03-21,"Neuroendocrine tumor (NET) cell lines frequently express both insulin-like growth factor (IGF) ligand and the cognate IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and, as such, potentially depend on the activation of IGF-1R and its downstream effectors for growth and survival. Preclinical studies suggest that somatostatin analogs and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors exhibit antitumor activity against NETs through inhibition of IGF-1-dependent signaling, suggesting that IGF-1R inhibition may be a promising therapeutic approach to NETs. Therefore, the authors of this report evaluated the safety and efficacy of MK-0646, a fully human monoclonal antibody (MoAb) that binds to the IGF-1R, as monotherapy in patients with metastatic, well-differentiated NETs. A phase 2 study was performed in which patients received intravenous MK-0646 10 mg/kg once weekly over 1 hour. Archived pretreatment tumor tissue was obtained and genotyped for v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, catalytic, alpha polypeptide (PIK3CA); and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) mutations, and immunohistochemistry was performed to measure the expression IGF-1R. Twenty-five patients received treatment (40% women; median age, 61 years; age range, 37-83 years), including 15 patients with carcinoid tumors and 10 patients with pancreatic NETs. No partial or complete responses were observed. The median progression-free survival was 4.2 months in the pancreatic NET cohort (range, 0.7-6.7 months) and 2.7 months in the carcinoid cohort (range, 2-3 months). Serious adverse events that were potentially related to MK-0646 included grade 3/4 hyperglycemia in 8 of 25 patients (32%), grade 2 hypersensitivity reaction in 1 of 24 patients (4%), and grade 3 lipase elevation in 1 of 25 patients (4%). Despite a compelling preclinical rationale, MK-0646 was inactive as a single agent in well-differentiated NETs.

The surgical time and the complication rate were compared between 30 patients who underwent conventional endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), cap-assisted endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR-C), or endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). All rectal carcinoid tumors were under 1 cm and were treated in our center between January 2002 and January 2008. Ten patients underwent each surgical approach. All cases were pathologically diagnosed as rectal carcinoid tumors. One-time complete resection rates using the conventional EMR, EMR-C, and ESD were 80%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. The operation time ranged from 5 to 53 minutes for the conventional EMR group, from 4 to 7 minutes for the EMR-C group, and from 16 to 35 minutes for the ESD group. The average follow-up time for the 30 patients was 18.43 ± 9.76 months. There were no recurrent or metastatic cases. Endoscopic resection for rectal carcinoid tumors below 1 cm was safe.

Varying malignant potential of appendiceal neuroendocrine tumors: importance of histologic subtype.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2012-07-05,"Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the appendix include malignant carcinoid tumor (MCT), goblet cell carcinoid (GCT), and composite goblet cell carcinoid-adenocarcinoma (CGCC-A). We compared characteristics and outcomes of these histologic subtypes. Patients with appendiceal NETs were identified from the National Cancer Database (1998-2007). Descriptive statistics were used to compare cohorts and associations between clinicopathologic factors and overall survival (OS) were examined using Cox proportional hazards models. A total of 2,812 patients with appendiceal NETs were identified. The most common histologic subtype was GCT (59.6%), followed by MCT (32.1%), CGCC-A (6.9%), and others (1.4%). CGCC-A had a significantly higher incidence of lymph node metastases (odds ratio [OR], 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-4.8) and distant metastases (OR, 6.0; 95% CI = 3.8-9.3) than GCT.

Prospective study of bevacizumab plus temozolomide in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2012-07-09,"Both tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor and bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF, have antitumor activity in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Temozolomide, an oral analog of dacarbazine, also has activity against NETs when administered alone or in combination with other agents. We performed a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy of temozolomide in combination with bevacizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NETs. Thirty-four patients (56% with carcinoid, 44% with pancreatic NETs) were treated with temozolomide 150 mg/m(2) orally per day on days 1 through 7 and days 15 through 21, together with bevacizumab at a dose of 5 mg/kg per day intravenously on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. All patients received prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii and varicella zoster. Patients were followed for toxicity, biochemical and radiologic response, and survival. The combination of temozolomide and bevacizumab was associated with anticipated grade 3 to 4 toxicities, including lymphopenia (53%) and thrombocytopenia (18%). Although the overall radiographic response rate was 15% (five of 34), response rates differed between patients with pancreatic NETs (33%; five of 15) and those with carcinoid tumors (zero of 19). The median progression-free survival was 11.0 months (14.3 months for pancreatic NETs v 7.3 months for carcinoid tumors). The median overall survival was 33.3 months (41.7 months for pancreatic NETs v 18.8 months for carcinoid tumors). Temozolomide and bevacizumab can be safely administered together in patients with advanced NETs, and the combination regimen appears promising for patients with pancreatic NETs.

KX2-391 is a synthetic, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Src tyrosine kinase (TK) signaling and tubulin polymerization. This compound is distinct from other Src kinase inhibitors by targeting the peptide substrate rather than the ATP binding site; the binding site on hetero-dimeric tubulin is novel and distinct from the taxanes and other known tubulin inhibitors. This multicenter Phase I trial utilized a 4 + 2 study design to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of KX2-391 in patients with refractory solid tumors. Forty-four (44) patients (18 M, 26 F; median age, 59) were enrolled in 9 dose cohorts. Dose-limiting toxicities, all reversible within 7 days, occurred in 7 patients and consisted of elevated AST (n = 4), ALT (n = 2), neutropenia (n = 1), thrombocytopenia (n = 1), failure to thrive (n = 1) and anorexia (n = 1). The MTD is 40 mg BID continuously. Eleven patients had stable disease for ≥ 4 months, including patients with ovarian, carcinoid, papillary thyroid, prostate, pancreas and head and neck cancer. Patients with prostate and pancreatic cancer also had significant biomarker decreases (PSA, 205 ng/mL to 39 ng/mL; CA19-9, 38,838 U/mL to 267 U/mL). The ovarian cancer patient has had stable disease > 12 months. KX2-391 was orally available, rapidly absorbed, and exposure was proportional to dose across the range investigated. KX2-391 has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, is well tolerated, demonstrates preliminary evidence of biologic activity, and warrants further evaluation in Phase II trials.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",2547.0,15.0,"Src kinase is central to tumor cell proliferation apoptosis and metastasis KX2-391 is a synthetic orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Src tyrosine kinase TK signaling and tubulin polymerization This compound is distinct from other Src kinase inhibitors by targeting the peptide substrate rather than the ATP binding site the binding site on hetero-dimeric tubulin is novel and distinct from the taxanes and other known tubulin inhibitors This multicenter Phase I trial utilized a 4 2 study design to determine the maximum tolerated dose MTD safety and pharmacokinetics PK of KX2-391 in patients with refractory solid tumors Forty-four 44 patients 18 M 26 F median age 59 were enrolled in 9 dose cohorts Dose-limiting toxicities all reversible within 7 days occurred in 7 patients and consisted of elevated AST n 4 ALT n 2 neutropenia n 1 thrombocytopenia n 1 failure to thrive n 1 and anorexia n 1 The MTD is 40 mg BID continuously Eleven patients had stable disease for ≥ 4 months including patients with papillary and head and cancer Patients with and cancer also had significant biomarker decreases PSA 205 ng/mL to 39 ng/mL CA19-9 38,838 U/mL to 267 U/mL The cancer patient has had stable disease 12 months KX2-391 was orally available rapidly absorbed and exposure was proportional to dose across the range investigated KX2-391 has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile is well tolerated demonstrates preliminary evidence of biologic activity and warrants further evaluation in Phase II trials",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[2023, 216, 16, 854, 6, 30, 31, 457, 351, 2, 278, 25498, 10881, 16, 8, 3273, 1428, 6582, 302, 1354, 230, 1, 2023, 564, 216, 5067, 314, 2, 5303, 12273, 26, 2823, 16, 834, 29, 127, 2023, 216, 222, 20, 529, 3, 1389, 4235, 1832, 76, 3, 3918, 791, 606, 3, 791, 606, 23, 28493, 16356, 5303, 16, 229, 2, 834, 29, 3, 2961, 2, 127, 440, 5303, 222, 26, 1570, 124, 70, 160, 2080, 8, 39, 18, 45, 771, 6, 223, 3, 689, 421, 61, 961, 367, 2, 1159, 2395, 1, 25498, 10881, 4, 7, 5, 430, 537, 57, 1213, 294, 584, 7, 203, 188, 432, 1068, 52, 89, 728, 11, 346, 4, 83, 61, 736, 61, 817, 385, 62, 2786, 262, 67, 162, 489, 4, 67, 7, 2, 1695, 1, 804, 5759, 78, 39, 4548, 78, 18, 778, 78, 14, 1340, 78, 14, 496, 6, 18868, 78, 14, 2, 3373, 78, 14, 3, 961, 16, 327, 81, 2793, 4285, 2627, 7, 42, 585, 34, 9, 749, 39, 53, 141, 7, 5, 1796, 2, 718, 2, 12, 7, 5, 2, 12, 120, 42, 93, 901, 2140, 534, 5286, 997, 542, 6, 587, 997, 542, 6058, 83, 519, 15257, 1767, 542, 6, 7559, 1767, 542, 3, 12, 69, 71, 42, 585, 34, 133, 53, 25498, 10881, 10, 1428, 390, 1755, 5249, 2, 645, 10, 831, 6, 61, 716, 3, 184, 565, 25498, 10881, 71, 8, 913, 1456, 800, 16, 149, 421, 1902, 1676, 241, 1, 1283, 128, 2, 2782, 195, 451, 4, 124, 215, 143]",1508.0,23361621,76

Patients with MCTs were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. Patients undergoing surgery were compared to unresected patients. Surgery was performed in 33% of patients. Predictors of surgery included age <50 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.4), low grade (OR, 3.1), and the appendix (OR, 36.2) or small intestine (OR, 27.2) as the primary site. Predictors of adverse survival included high grade (hazard ratio, 2.4) and no surgery (hazard ratio, 2.5) or surgery on only primary or distant disease (hazard ratio, 1.5) compared with surgery for both. Survival at 5 years was 5% with no surgery, 28% with surgery on either site, and 46% with surgery at both sites (P < .001).

FDG PET-CT aids in the preoperative assessment of patients with newly diagnosed thymic epithelial malignancies.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2013-04-01,"Advanced thymoma (stage III and IV) is difficult to detect by computed tomography (CT), yet it is important to distinguish between early (stage I and II) and advanced disease before surgery, as patients with locally advanced tumors require neoadjuvant chemotherapy to enable effective resection. This study assessed whether the amount of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake can predict advanced thymoma and whether it can separate thymoma from thymic cancer. We retrospectively reviewed FDG positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scans of 51 consecutive newly diagnosed patients with thymic epithelial malignancy. PET-CT findings documented focal FDG activity: SUVmax, SUVmean, SUVpeak, and total body volumetric standardized uptake value (SUV) measurements. These were correlated with Masaoka-Koga staging and World Health Organization classification. Wilcoxon ranked sum tests were used to assess association between SUV and pathological stage, cancer type, and classification. Among the study patients, 37 had thymoma, 12 thymic carcinoma, and 2 thymic carcinoid. Higher focal FDG uptake was seen in patients with type B3 thymoma than in those with type A, AB, B1, or B2 thymoma (p < 0.006). FDG uptake was higher in patients with thymic carcinoma or carcinoid than in patients with thymoma (p < 0.0003), with more variable associations with volumetric SUV measurements. There was no significant association observed between higher focal FDG uptake and advanced-stage disease in thymoma patients (p > 0.09), although greater FDG-avid tumor volume was significantly associated with advanced disease (p < 0.03).

High-level microsatellite instability in appendiceal carcinomas.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2013-08-01,"High-level microsatellite instability (MSI-high) is found in approximately 15% of all colorectal adenocarcinomas (CRCs) and in at least 20% of right-sided cancers. It is most commonly due to somatic hypermethylation of the MLH1 gene promoter region, with familial cases (Lynch syndrome) representing only 2% to 3% of CRCs overall. In contrast to CRC, MSI-high in appendiceal adenocarcinomas is rare. Only 4 MSI-high appendiceal carcinomas and 1 MSI-high appendiceal serrated adenoma have been previously reported, and the prevalence of MSI in the appendix is unknown. We identified 108 appendiceal carcinomas from MD Anderson Cancer Center in which MSI status had been assessed by immunohistochemistry for the DNA mismatch-repair proteins MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 (n=83), polymerase chain reaction (n=7), or both (n=18). Three cases (2.8%) were MSI-high, and 1 was MSI-low. The 3 MSI-high cases included: (1) a poorly differentiated nonmucinous adenocarcinoma with loss of MLH1/PMS2 expression, lack of MLH1 promoter methylation, and lack of BRAF gene mutation, but no detected germline mutation in MLH1 from a 39-year-old man; (2) an undifferentiated carcinoma with loss of MSH2/MSH6, but no detected germline mutation in MSH2 or TACSTD1, from a 59-year-old woman; and (3) a moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma arising in a villous adenoma with loss of MSH2/MSH6 expression, in a 38-year-old man with a strong family history of CRC who declined germline testing. When the overall group of appendiceal carcinomas was classified according to histologic features and precursor lesions, the frequencies of MSI-high were: 3 of 108 (2.8%) invasive carcinomas, 3 of 96 (3.1%) invasive carcinomas that did not arise from a background of goblet cell carcinoid tumors, and 0 of 12 (0%) signet ring and mucinous carcinomas arising in goblet cell carcinoid tumors. These findings, in conjunction with the previously reported MSI-high appendiceal carcinomas, highlight the low prevalence of MSI in the appendix as compared with the right colon and suggest that MLH1 promoter methylation is not a mechanism for MSI in this location. ",Case Reports,2364.0,15.0,High-level microsatellite instability MSI-high is found in approximately 15 of all adenocarcinomas CRCs and in at least 20 of right-sided cancers It is most commonly due to somatic hypermethylation of the MLH1 gene promoter region with familial cases Lynch syndrome representing only 2 to 3 of CRCs overall In contrast to CRC MSI-high in appendiceal adenocarcinomas is rare Only 4 MSI-high appendiceal carcinomas and 1 MSI-high appendiceal serrated adenoma have been previously reported and the prevalence of MSI in the is unknown We identified 108 appendiceal carcinomas from MD Anderson Cancer Center in which MSI status had been assessed by immunohistochemistry for the DNA mismatch-repair proteins MLH1 MSH2 MSH6 and PMS2 n=83 polymerase chain reaction n=7 or both n=18 Three cases 2.8 were MSI-high and 1 was MSI-low The 3 MSI-high cases included 1 a poorly differentiated nonmucinous adenocarcinoma with loss of MLH1/PMS2 expression lack of MLH1 promoter methylation and lack of BRAF gene mutation but no detected germline mutation in MLH1 from a 39-year-old man 2 an undifferentiated carcinoma with loss of MSH2/MSH6 but no detected germline mutation in MSH2 or TACSTD1 from a 59-year-old woman and 3 a moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma arising in a villous adenoma with loss of MSH2/MSH6 expression in a 38-year-old man with a strong family history of CRC who declined germline testing When the overall group of appendiceal carcinomas was classified according to histologic features and precursor lesions the frequencies of MSI-high were 3 of 108 2.8 invasive carcinomas 3 of 96 3.1 invasive carcinomas that did not arise from a background of goblet cell tumors and 0 of 12 0 signet ring and mucinous carcinomas arising in goblet cell tumors These findings in conjunction with the previously reported MSI-high appendiceal carcinomas highlight the low prevalence of MSI in the as compared with the right and suggest that MLH1 promoter methylation is not a mechanism for MSI in this location,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[64, 301, 2226, 1753, 1494, 64, 16, 204, 4, 705, 167, 1, 62, 1586, 4184, 2, 4, 28, 506, 179, 1, 1913, 1689, 163, 192, 16, 96, 841, 520, 6, 1119, 2575, 1, 3, 3321, 145, 973, 1053, 5, 2200, 140, 3546, 681, 2861, 158, 18, 6, 27, 1, 4184, 63, 4, 748, 6, 590, 1494, 64, 4, 5708, 1586, 16, 622, 158, 39, 1494, 64, 5708, 826, 2, 14, 1494, 64, 5708, 7123, 2434, 47, 85, 373, 210, 2, 3, 1078, 1, 1494, 4, 3, 16, 860, 21, 108, 3590, 5708, 826, 29, 2244, 1929, 12, 574, 4, 92, 1494, 156, 42, 85, 275, 20, 888, 9, 3, 261, 2617, 972, 652, 3321, 4272, 5176, 2, 7300, 78, 852, 1451, 1260, 1329, 78, 67, 15, 110, 78, 203, 169, 140, 18, 66, 11, 1494, 64, 2, 14, 10, 1494, 154, 3, 27, 1494, 64, 140, 159, 14, 8, 1240, 1442, 10209, 449, 5, 407, 1, 3321, 7300, 55, 926, 1, 3321, 973, 569, 2, 926, 1, 566, 145, 258, 84, 77, 530, 1009, 258, 4, 3321, 29, 8, 587, 111, 1095, 3628, 18, 35, 4480, 134, 5, 407, 1, 4272, 5176, 84, 77, 530, 1009, 258, 4, 4272, 15, 62773, 29, 8, 728, 111, 1095, 2854, 2, 27, 8, 3508, 1442, 2391, 449, 2635, 4, 8, 10573, 2434, 5, 407, 1, 4272, 5176, 55, 4, 8, 519, 111, 1095, 3628, 5, 8, 1082, 607, 532, 1, 590, 54, 3054, 1009, 471, 198, 3, 63, 87, 1, 5708, 826, 10, 1373, 768, 6, 884, 404, 2, 2765, 406, 3, 2722, 1, 1494, 64, 11, 27, 1, 3590, 18, 66, 416, 826, 27, 1, 921, 27, 14, 416, 826, 17, 205, 44, 3043, 29, 8, 2426, 1, 16930, 31, 57, 2, 13, 1, 133, 13, 5489, 4091, 2, 2391, 826, 2635, 4, 16930, 31, 57, 46, 272, 4, 3357, 5, 3, 373, 210, 1494, 64, 5708, 826, 1817, 3, 154, 1078, 1, 1494, 4, 3, 22, 72, 5, 3, 1913, 2, 309, 17, 3321, 973, 569, 16, 44, 8, 670, 9, 1494, 4, 26, 1147]",2013.0,23648460,114
Phase 1 study of dose escalation in hypofractionated proton beam therapy for non-small cell lung cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2013-05-18,"Many patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cannot undergo concurrent chemotherapy because of comorbidities or poor performance status. Hypofractionated radiation regimens, if tolerable, may provide an option to these patients for effective local control. Twenty-five patients were enrolled in a phase 1 dose-escalation trial of proton beam therapy (PBT) from September 2010 through July 2012. Eligible patients had histologically documented lung cancer, thymic tumors, carcinoid tumors, or metastatic thyroid tumors. Concurrent chemotherapy was not allowed, but concurrent treatment with biologic agents was. The dose-escalation schema comprised 15 fractions of 3 Gy(relative biological effectiveness [RBE])/fraction, 3.5 Gy(RBE)/fraction, or 4 Gy(RBE)/fraction. Dose constraints were derived from biologically equivalent doses of standard fractionated treatment. The median follow-up time for patients alive at the time of analysis was 13 months (range, 8-28 months). Fifteen patients received treatment to hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes. Two patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity possibly related to treatment; 1 received 3.5-Gy(RBE) fractions and experienced an in-field tracheoesophageal fistula 9 months after PBT and 1 month after bevacizumab. The other patient received 4-Gy(RBE) fractions and was hospitalized for bacterial pneumonia/radiation pneumonitis 4 months after PBT. Hypofractionated PBT to the thorax delivered over 3 weeks was well tolerated even with significant doses to the lungs and mediastinal structures.

Utilization of a TFE3 break-apart FISH assay in a renal tumor consultation service.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2013-08-01,"Xp11 translocation renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) are characterized by chromosome translocations involving the Xp11.2 breakpoint, resulting in gene fusions involving the TFE3 transcription factor. In archival material, the diagnosis can often be confirmed by TFE3 immunohistochemistry (IHC), but variable fixation (especially prevalent in consultation material) can lead to equivocal results. A TFE3 break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay has been developed to detect TFE3 gene rearrangements; however, the utility of this assay in a renal tumor consultation practice has not been examined. We reviewed 95 consecutive renal tumor consultation cases submitted to rule in or rule out Xp11 translocation RCC. Thirty-one cases were positive for TFE3 rearrangements by FISH. Patients ranged from 6 to 67 years of age (mean=30 y; median=28 y). Novel or distinctive morphologic features of these cases included extensive cystic change simulating multilocular cystic RCC (3 cases), sarcomatoid transformation (3 cases), oncocytic areas mimicking oncocytoma (1 case), trabecular architecture mimicking a carcinoid tumor (1 case), colonization of renal pelvic urothelium mimicking urothelial carcinoma in situ (1), and focal desmin and diffuse racemase immunoreactivity (1 case each). Twenty-six of the 31 TFE3 FISH-positive RCCs were unequivocally positive for TFE3 by IHC, but 4 were equivocal, and 1 was negative. Of the 64 cases that were negative by TFE3 FISH, 50 were negative by TFE3 IHC, and 14 were equivocal. Thirty-two of the 64 TFE3 FISH-negative cases could be classified into other accepted RCC subtypes: 23 as clear cell RCC, 5 as papillary RCC, 3 as clear cell papillary RCC, and 1 as chromophobe RCC. The other 32 cases remained unclassified, including 3 cathepsin K-positive RCC that closely resembled Xp11 translocation RCC. In conclusion, TFE3 FISH is highly useful in renal tumor consultation material, often resolving cases with equivocal TFE3 IHC results. Given the difficulty of optimizing TFE3 IHC, TFE3 FISH is for most laboratories the optimal test for establishing the diagnosis of Xp11 translocation RCC.

Recurrence of pulmonary carcinoid tumors after resection: implications for postoperative surveillance.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2013-07-31,"The current guidelines for follow-up care after treatment of non-small cell lung cancer recommend continued surveillance for detection of recurrent or metachronous disease. However, carcinoid tumors, especially those with a typical histologic profile, tend to be less aggressive. Our goal was to determine the patterns of relapse and the manner of detection of recurrences, to guide follow-up care after resection. Patients who underwent operations for pulmonary carcinoids at our institution were identified from a prospectively maintained database, and their medical records were reviewed for relapse patterns, detection methods, and outcomes. A total of 337 patients who underwent resection between 1993 and 2010 were included, with a median follow-up time of 3.5 years. Typical and atypical carcinoids were present in 291 (86%) and 46 (14%) patients, respectively. Recurrences occurred in 21 patients (6%), with distant metastases in 20 patients (95%) and locoregional recurrence in only 1 patient. Most recurrences (15 [76%]) were not detected through scheduled surveillance imaging but after the presentation of symptoms (7 [33%]) or incidentally by studies performed for unrelated reasons (8 [38%]). The risk of recurrence increased with positive lymph nodes and atypical histologic type. Only 9 of 291 patients (3%) with typical carcinoids experienced recurrences, with a median time to recurrence of 4 years (range, 0.8-12 years).

Free somatostatin receptor fraction predicts the antiproliferative effect of octreotide in a neuroendocrine tumor model: implications for dose optimization.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2013-09-30,"Somatostatin receptors (SSTR) are highly expressed in well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NET). Octreotide, an SSTR agonist, has been used to suppress the production of vasoactive hormones and relieve symptoms of hormone hypersecretion with functional NETs. In a clinical trial, an empiric dose of octreotide treatment prolonged time to tumor progression in patients with small bowel neuroendocrine (carcinoid) tumors, irrespective of symptom status. However, there has yet to be a dose optimization study across the patient population, and methods are currently lacking to optimize dosing of octreotide therapy on an individual basis. Multiple factors such as total tumor burden, receptor expression levels, and nontarget organ metabolism/excretion may contribute to a variation in SSTR octreotide occupancy with a given dose among different patients. In this study, we report the development of an imaging method to measure surface SSTR expression and occupancy level using the PET radiotracer (68)Ga-DOTATOC. In an animal model, SSTR occupancy by octreotide was assessed quantitatively with (68)Ga-DOTATOC PET, with the finding that increased occupancy resulted in decreased tumor proliferation rate. The results suggested that quantitative SSTR imaging during octreotide therapy has the potential to determine the fractional receptor occupancy in NETs, thereby allowing octreotide dosing to be optimized readily in individual patients.

We report the largest series to date of 49 patients with locally advanced or metastatic pulmonary carcinoid. The Johns Hopkins Pathology Database was reviewed for APC patients treated between January 1992 and December 2012. Data on time to recurrence, progression-free survival, and overall survival were estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Forty-nine patients were treated for APC in the specified time period. Median time to recurrence after surgical resection was 2.5 years (atypical carcinoid [AC] versus typical carcinoid [TC], 2.5 versus 6.3 years; p = 0.063). Median survival with advanced disease was 7.1 years and significantly longer for TC compared with AC (10.2 versus 4 years; p = 0.009).

Alternative lengthening of telomeres predicts site of origin in neuroendocrine tumor liver metastases.,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,J. Am. Coll. Surg.,2014-01-10,"The determination of the primary tumor origin in patients with neuroendocrine tumor liver metastases (NELM) can pose a considerable management challenge. Recent studies have shown that the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is prevalent in some human tumors, including pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNET), and can be useful in predicting tumor biology. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the use of ALT as a biomarker in patients with NELM, in particular to predict the site of origin of metastases. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed using tumor tissue from NELM patients undergoing liver resection between 1998 and 2010. These included 43 PanNET and 47 gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors. The TMAs were tested for ALT using telomere-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization. The association between ALT positivity and clinicopathologic features and long-term outcomes was investigated. Alternative lengthening of telomeres was positive (ALT+) in 26 (29%) of the 90 tumors included in the TMAs. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors were ALT+ in 56% of patients, compared with only 4% ALT+ among gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors (p < 0.001). The specificity of ALT for detecting pancreatic origin was 96% and the positive predictive value was 92%, and sensitivity was 56% and the negative predictive value was 70%. Additionally, ALT was associated with the pattern of metastatic disease: ALT+ NELM were more likely to have oligometastases (p = 0.001) and less likely to be bilateral in distribution (p = 0.05) than were ALT tumors. In addition, ALT+ was associated with improved prognosis in the PanNET patient population. Alternative lengthening of telomeres was found to be a useful biomarker in patients with NELM. This marker can be helpful in guiding therapy by identifying the site of origin in patients in whom the primary site is unknown.",Evaluation Study,2202.0,15.0,The determination of the primary tumor origin in patients with neuroendocrine tumor metastases NELM can pose a considerable management challenge Recent studies have shown that the alternative lengthening of telomeres ALT is prevalent in some human tumors including neuroendocrine tumors PanNET and can be useful in predicting tumor biology In this study we aimed to evaluate the use of ALT as a biomarker in patients with NELM in particular to predict the site of origin of metastases Tissue microarrays TMAs were constructed using tumor tissue from NELM patients undergoing resection between 1998 and 2010 These included 43 PanNET and 47 tumors The TMAs were tested for ALT using telomere-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization The association between ALT positivity and clinicopathologic features and long-term outcomes was investigated Alternative lengthening of telomeres was positive ALT+ in 26 29 of the 90 tumors included in the TMAs neuroendocrine tumors were ALT+ in 56 of patients compared with only 4 ALT+ among tumors p 0.001 The specificity of ALT for detecting origin was 96 and the positive predictive value was 92 and sensitivity was 56 and the negative predictive value was 70 Additionally ALT was associated with the pattern of metastatic disease ALT+ NELM were more likely to have oligometastases p 0.001 and less likely to be bilateral in distribution p 0.05 than were ALT tumors In addition ALT+ was associated with improved prognosis in the PanNET patient population Alternative lengthening of telomeres was found to be a useful biomarker in patients with NELM This marker can be helpful in guiding therapy by identifying the site of origin in patients in whom the primary site is unknown,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 3104, 1, 3, 86, 30, 1938, 4, 7, 5, 1542, 30, 196, 6061, 122, 6015, 8, 2658, 284, 1745, 435, 94, 47, 443, 17, 3, 1091, 13048, 1, 7220, 4548, 16, 2485, 4, 476, 171, 57, 141, 1542, 57, 12945, 2, 122, 40, 999, 4, 1434, 30, 891, 4, 26, 45, 21, 1295, 6, 376, 3, 119, 1, 4548, 22, 8, 901, 4, 7, 5, 6061, 4, 1454, 6, 678, 3, 606, 1, 1938, 1, 196, 246, 2774, 11278, 11, 2776, 75, 30, 246, 29, 6061, 7, 479, 170, 59, 1850, 2, 1120, 46, 159, 601, 12945, 2, 662, 57, 3, 11278, 11, 650, 9, 4548, 75, 4136, 112, 2910, 4, 957, 1554, 3, 248, 59, 4548, 1887, 2, 1399, 404, 2, 319, 337, 123, 10, 565, 1091, 13048, 1, 7220, 10, 109, 4548, 4, 432, 462, 1, 3, 424, 57, 159, 4, 3, 11278, 1542, 57, 11, 4548, 4, 664, 1, 7, 72, 5, 158, 39, 4548, 107, 57, 19, 13, 144, 3, 1121, 1, 4548, 9, 2502, 1938, 10, 921, 2, 3, 109, 464, 549, 10, 937, 2, 485, 10, 664, 2, 3, 199, 464, 549, 10, 431, 1724, 4548, 10, 41, 5, 3, 1177, 1, 113, 34, 4548, 6061, 11, 80, 322, 6, 47, 10914, 19, 13, 144, 2, 299, 322, 6, 40, 1607, 4, 1395, 19, 13, 474, 76, 11, 4548, 57, 4, 352, 4548, 10, 41, 5, 231, 356, 4, 3, 12945, 69, 266, 1091, 13048, 1, 7220, 10, 204, 6, 40, 8, 999, 901, 4, 7, 5, 6061, 26, 952, 122, 40, 3951, 4, 5972, 36, 20, 1386, 3, 606, 1, 1938, 4, 7, 4, 953, 3, 86, 606, 16, 860]",1714.0,24655849,59
Octreotide long-acting repeatable use among elderly patients with carcinoid syndrome and survival outcomes: a population-based analysis.,Cancer,Cancer,2014-03-26,"Octreotide long-acting repeatable (LAR) is indicated for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome and diarrhea related to VIPoma, and may delay tumor growth in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). To the authors' knowledge, the pattern of octreotide LAR use in clinical practice and its impact on survival outcomes has not been well documented. Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database, the authors identified patients with NET aged ≥ 65 years who were diagnosed between July 1999 and December 2007. Patients with US Food and Drug Administration-approved indications for octreotide LAR were identified from Medicare claims. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to ascertain factors associated with octreotide LAR use, whereas the Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the impact of octreotide LAR on survival. Among those with Food and Drug Administration-approved indications, 245 of 4848 patients with distant-stage disease (51%) and 81 of 807 patients with local/regional disease (10%) initiated treatment with octreotide LAR within 6 months of diagnosis. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that among those with distant-stage disease, older age (≥ 80 years vs 65-69 years) (odds ratio [OR], 0.43; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.23-0.81), female sex (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40-0.97), and living in the South (vs Northeast) (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.18-0.72) were associated with a lower likelihood of using octreotide LAR. The multivariate proportional hazards model showed that octreotide LAR provided a significant 5-year survival benefit for patients with distant-stage disease (hazards ratio, 0.61; P ≤ .001), whereas this survival benefit was not shown for the patients with local/regional stage (hazards ratio, 0.88; P = .563).

"Telotristat etiprate, a novel serotonin synthesis inhibitor, in patients with carcinoid syndrome and diarrhea not adequately controlled by octreotide.",Endocrine-related cancer,Endocr. Relat. Cancer,2014-07-10,"Serotonin produced by neuroendocrine tumors is believed to be a principal cause of the diarrhea in carcinoid syndrome. We assessed the safety and efficacy of telotristat etiprate, an oral serotonin synthesis inhibitor, in patients with diarrhea associated with carcinoid syndrome. In this prospective, randomized study, patients with evidence of carcinoid tumor and ≥4 bowel movements (BMs)/day despite stable-dose octreotide LAR depot therapy were enrolled in sequential, escalating, cohorts of four patients per cohort. In each cohort, one patient was randomly assigned to placebo and three patients to telotristat etiprate, at 150, 250, 350, or 500 mg three times a day (tid). In a subsequent cohort, one patient was assigned to placebo and six patients to telotristat etiprate 500 mg tid. Patients were assessed for safety, BM frequency (daily diary), 24 h urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (u5-HIAA), and adequate relief of carcinoid gastrointestinal symptoms (using a weekly questionnaire). Twenty-three patients were treated: 18 received telotristat etiprate and five received placebo. Adverse events were generally mild. Among evaluable telotristat etiprate-treated patients, 5/18 (28%) experienced a ≥30% reduction in BM frequency for ≥2 weeks, 9/16 (56%) experienced biochemical response (≥50% reduction or normalization in 24-h u5-HIAA) at week 2 or 4, and 10/18 (56%) reported adequate relief during at least 1 of the first 4 weeks of treatment.

The rarity of these tumors pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Our purpose was to characterize the cases treated at a tertiary cancer center and to evaluate patient outcomes with the available treatment modalities. This was a retrospective study of patients with renal NETs seen at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between January 1, 2001, and January 1, 2011. Patient and tumor data were analyzed using descriptive statistical methods. Three cases of carcinoid tumors and 6 cases of small cell carcinoma were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 53 years for patients with carcinoid and 65 years for patients with small cell carcinoma. The most common presenting symptoms were back pain, flank pain, and hematuria. The morphological appearance of the tumor cells and their immunohistochemical reactivity for neuroendocrine markers and cytokeratin helped establish the diagnosis. Nephrectomy was the mainstay of treatment for carcinoid tumors, yielding good long-term results, even in the presence of metastases. Surgery and chemotherapy were used for small cell carcinoma of the kidney. The median overall survival for patients with small cell carcinoma of the kidney was 17.3 months.

Clinical benefits of above-standard dose of octreotide LAR in patients with neuroendocrine tumors for control of carcinoid syndrome symptoms: a multicenter retrospective chart review study.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2014-08-05,"Octreotide LAR is used in patients for control of carcinoid syndrome (CS) and other symptoms of hormone hypersecretion. The aim of this study was to examine reasons for octreotide LAR dose escalation and observe CS symptom improvement in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) who underwent octreotide LAR dose escalation at three cancer referral centers. Medical records for patients with diagnosis of carcinoid or pancreatic NET who had received one dose or more of octreotide LAR above 30 mg every 4 weeks from 2000 to 2012 were reviewed. Reasons for dose escalation and symptomatic outcomes were abstracted for each patient 3 months prior to and up to 12 months following the dose escalation. Of the evaluated 239 NET patients, 53% were male, mean age at first dose escalation was 60 years (standard deviation [SD]: 11 years), and mean time from octreotide LAR initiation to first dose escalation was 1.7 years (SD: 2.0 years). The primary reasons reported for dose escalation were carcinoid or hormonal syndrome (62%) or radiographic progression (28%). The most common dose changes at the first dose escalation were 40 mg every 4 weeks (71%) and 60 mg every 4 weeks (18%). Of 90 patients in whom flushing was reported prior to first dose escalation, 73 (81%) were reported to have experienced improvement or resolution of their symptoms following the dose escalation. Of 107 patients who were reported to have experienced diarrhea before the first dose escalation, 85 (79%) were reported to have experienced improvement or resolution after first dose escalation. The goal of improved symptom control is a common reason for dose escalation of octreotide LAR.

Patients (≥ 3-≤ 21 years) with neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, or rare tumors with neuroendocrine features were eligible. Part A (single dose of NTX-010) enrolled 13 patients at three dose levels (1 × 10(9) viral particles (vp)/kg [n = 6], 1 × 10(10) vp/kg [n = 3], 1 × 10(11) vp/kg [n = 4]). Diagnoses included neuroblastoma (n = 9), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 2), carcinoid tumor (n = 1), and adrenocorticocarcinoma (n = 1). Part B added cyclophosphamide (CTX) (oral CTX (25 mg/m(2) /day) days 1-14 and IV CTX (750 mg/m(2) ) days 8 and 29) to two doses of NTX-010 (1 × 10(11) vp/kg, days 8 and 29). Nine patients enrolled to Part B. Diagnoses included neuroblastoma (n = 3), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 1), Wilms tumor (n = 3), and adrenocorticocarcinoma (n = 2). Twelve patients on Part A were evaluable for toxicity. There was a single DLT (grade 3 pain) at dose level 1. Additional grade ≥ 3 related adverse events (AEs) included leukopenia (n = 1), neutropenia (n = 3), lymphopenia (n = 3), and tumor pain (n = 1). No DLTs occurred on part B. Other grade ≥ 3 related AEs on Part B included: Leukopenia (n = 3), nausea (n = 1), emesis (n = 1), anemia (n = 1), neutropenia (n = 4), platelets (n = 1), alanine aminotransferase (n = 1), and lymphopenia (n = 2). All patients cleared NTX-010 from blood and stool by 3 weeks with 17/18 patients developing neutralizing antibodies. NTX-010 is feasible and tolerable at the dose levels tested in pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumors either alone or in combination with cyclophosphamide.

We studied a large series of TNET identified through the International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group and the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons databases. This was a retrospective multicenter study of patients undergoing operation for TNET between 1984 and 2012. Outcome measures were: overall survival (OS) and cumulative incidence of recurrences (CIR). OS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and CIR was analyzed using competing risk analysis. Associations with clinical and prognostic factors for OS and CIR were evaluated using the log rank test and Gray test. Two hundred five patients with TNET were treated: 25 patients received induction therapy (19 chemotherapy [CT] and 6 radiotherapy [RT]). Data about resection status were available in 47% of cases: complete resection was performed in 52 patients (54%). Masaoka-Koga stages I, II, III, and IV were observed in 12, 33, 56, and 47 patients, respectively. Atypical carcinoid was the commonest histologic subtype (71 cases; 40%). One hundred one patients with TNET received adjuvant treatment; 52 patients died and 36 experienced a recurrence. The median OS was 7.5 years; 5-year OS was 68%, and 5-year CIR was 39%. OS was significantly influenced by Masaoka-Koga stage (P = .02) and completeness of resection (P = .03). CIR significantly increased in high Masaoka-Koga stages (P = .04).

Demographic, treatment, and outcome data on all patients with pulmonary AC were obtained from the SEER database with 18 reporting sites from 1973 to 2010 using SEER*Stat 8.1.2. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). There were 947,463 patients diagnosed with lung and bronchus tumors in the SEER database, of which 441 had AC (0.05%). Median age of AC patients was 65 years; 69% were women and 87% of white ethnicity. Metastatic disease was present in 20% of patients at diagnosis. In terms of treatment, 78% of patients underwent resection and 12.5% received radiation. The overall 1-year and 3-year survival rates were 86% and 67%, respectively. The 3-year survival rates for distant (M1), regional (lymph node involvement), and localized (lung only) disease were 26% (13 of 50), 69% (50 of 72), and 85% (99 of 116), respectively. On univariate analysis, patients treated with surgery had reduced risk of death (hazard ratio, HR 0.19; p < 0.001), whereas radiation treatment was associated with increased risk of death (HR 2.45; p < 0.001). AC accounted for less than 1% of all lung cancers diagnosed and was more frequent in women.

"Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation, safety, and pharmacokinetics study of ME-344 as a single agent in patients with refractory solid tumors.",Cancer,Cancer,2014-11-19,"The current phase 1, open-label, dose escalation study was conducted to establish the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, and preliminary antitumor activity of the novel mitochondrial inhibitor ME-344 in patients with refractory solid tumors. Patients with refractory solid tumors were treated in a 3 + 3 dose escalation design. ME-344 was administered via intravenous infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 of the first 28-day cycle and weekly thereafter. Pharmacokinetics was assessed on days 1 and 15 of the first cycle. A total of 30 patients (median age, 65 years; 67% of whom were female) received ME-344. There were 5 dose-limiting toxicities reported. Four patients developed grade 3 neuropathy (2 patients each at doses of 15 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg) and 1 patient treated at a dose of 10 mg/kg developed a grade 3 acute myocardial infarction (toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 4.03]). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as 10 mg/kg weekly. The most common adverse events were nausea, dizziness, and fatigue. At the MTD of 10 mg/kg, the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) was 25.8 µg/mL and the area under the concentration curve from time zero to infinity was 25.9 hour*µg/mL. One patient with small cell lung cancer achieved a partial response for ≥ 52 weeks. Four patients had prolonged stable disease (1 patient each with urothelial carcinoma [47 weeks], carcinoid tumor [≥ 40 weeks], cervical leiomyosarcoma [39 weeks], and cervical cancer [≥ 31 weeks]). The once-weekly administration of ME-344 was generally well tolerated in the current study, a first-in-human study; dose-limiting neuropathy was noted, but not at the MTD. Exposures at the 10-mg/kg dose level suggest a sufficient therapeutic index. The preliminary clinical activity as a monotherapy supports the further clinical development of ME-344 in combination with chemotherapy.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",1889.0,13.0,The current phase 1 open-label dose escalation study was conducted to establish the safety tolerability pharmacokinetic profile and preliminary antitumor activity of the novel mitochondrial inhibitor ME-344 in patients with refractory solid tumors Patients with refractory solid tumors were treated in a 3 3 dose escalation design ME-344 was administered via intravenous infusion on days 1 8 and 15 of the first 28-day cycle and weekly thereafter Pharmacokinetics was assessed on days 1 and 15 of the first cycle A total of 30 patients median age 65 years 67 of whom were female received ME-344 There were 5 dose-limiting toxicities reported Four patients developed grade 3 neuropathy 2 patients each at doses of 15 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg and 1 patient treated at a dose of 10 mg/kg developed a grade 3 acute myocardial infarction toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 The maximum tolerated dose MTD was defined as 10 mg/kg weekly The most common adverse events were nausea dizziness and fatigue At the MTD of 10 mg/kg the maximal plasma concentration Cmax was 25.8 µg/mL and the area under the concentration curve from time zero to infinity was 25.9 hour*µg/mL One patient with small cell cancer achieved a partial response for ≥ 52 weeks Four patients had prolonged stable disease 1 patient each with urothelial carcinoma 47 weeks tumor ≥ 40 weeks leiomyosarcoma 39 weeks and cancer ≥ 31 weeks The once-weekly administration of ME-344 was generally well tolerated in the current study a first-in-human study dose-limiting neuropathy was noted but not at the MTD Exposures at the 10-mg/kg dose level suggest a sufficient therapeutic index The preliminary clinical activity as a monotherapy supports the further clinical development of ME-344 in combination with chemotherapy,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[3, 291, 124, 14, 1020, 1756, 61, 1125, 45, 10, 426, 6, 1811, 3, 367, 1543, 1456, 800, 2, 1676, 579, 128, 1, 3, 229, 2019, 230, 4816, 6993, 4, 7, 5, 430, 537, 57, 7, 5, 430, 537, 57, 11, 73, 4, 8, 27, 27, 61, 1125, 771, 4816, 6993, 10, 468, 847, 1262, 904, 23, 162, 14, 66, 2, 167, 1, 3, 157, 339, 218, 417, 2, 709, 3972, 1159, 10, 275, 23, 162, 14, 2, 167, 1, 3, 157, 417, 8, 181, 1, 201, 7, 52, 89, 556, 60, 598, 1, 953, 11, 1061, 103, 4816, 6993, 125, 11, 33, 61, 817, 385, 210, 294, 7, 276, 88, 27, 1751, 18, 7, 296, 28, 415, 1, 167, 81, 503, 2, 179, 81, 503, 2, 14, 69, 73, 28, 8, 61, 1, 79, 81, 503, 276, 8, 88, 27, 286, 5098, 6124, 155, 10, 3468, 768, 6, 3, 657, 12, 1377, 186, 3462, 371, 9, 290, 281, 2256, 39, 680, 3, 689, 421, 61, 961, 10, 395, 22, 79, 81, 503, 709, 3, 96, 186, 290, 281, 11, 1218, 11489, 2, 613, 28, 3, 961, 1, 79, 81, 503, 3, 2725, 554, 1227, 9818, 10, 243, 66, 7570, 542, 2, 3, 965, 669, 3, 1227, 1496, 29, 98, 5115, 6, 12290, 10, 243, 83, 2583, 7570, 542, 104, 69, 5, 302, 31, 12, 513, 8, 450, 51, 9, 749, 653, 244, 294, 7, 42, 1069, 585, 34, 14, 69, 296, 5, 1472, 134, 662, 244, 30, 749, 327, 244, 3717, 587, 244, 2, 12, 749, 456, 244, 3, 1059, 709, 634, 1, 4816, 6993, 10, 1228, 149, 421, 4, 3, 291, 45, 8, 157, 4, 171, 45, 61, 817, 1751, 10, 1051, 84, 44, 28, 3, 961, 3401, 28, 3, 79, 81, 503, 61, 301, 309, 8, 1952, 189, 558, 3, 1676, 38, 128, 22, 8, 1411, 2304, 3, 195, 38, 193, 1, 4816, 6993, 4, 150, 5, 56]",1856.0,25411085,71

Recognition of the need for broad collaboration led to the creation of the International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group (ITMIG) and the development of a large, centralized database to advance knowledge of these rare tumors. A multidisciplinary Database Committee was convened to define a common set of data elements a priori. Retrospective data were solicited from ITMIG members and collated using standardized fields. Patients with thymoma, thymic carcinoma, or thymic carcinoid were included. Over a 6-month period, 47 institutions spanning 15 countries contributed a total of 6097 cases (mean, 129 [range, 10-1209]). The sex distribution was equal for thymomas, but there was a greater proportion of men with thymic carcinoma and thymic carcinoid (p < 0.0001). Nearly all cases (99%) were treated surgically. WHO type B2 was the most frequent histologic classification among thymomas, whereas squamous was the most common among thymic carcinomas.

Lymph Node Metastasis Predicts Disease Recurrence in a Single-Center Experience of 70 Stages 1-3 Appendix Cancers: A Retrospective Review.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2015-02-07,"Previous reports on the surgical management of appendix cancer show high recurrence rates among patients initially presenting with localized disease. This study sought to characterize predictors of outcome among patients treated for stages 1-3 appendix cancer at the authors' institution. Patients with nonmetastatic appendix cancer undergoing definitive surgery at a single cancer center from 1994 to 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with appendiceal adenomas, cystadenomas, or classical carcinoids were excluded from the study. The median follow-up period was 5.2 years (interquartile range 2.9-6.7 years). The study identified 70 patients, 49 % of whom were women. The median age was 52 years (range 20-84 years). All were explored by an expert surgeon who had treated at least 20 appendiceal cancers. The procedures were appendectomy (n = 2), right hemicolectomy (n = 66), and diagnostic laparoscopy and placement of an intraperitoneal port (n = 2). The final pathology showed that transmural (30 T4, 32 T3, 4 T2, 4 T1) and node-negative disease (80 %) were common. Goblet cell carcinoid (GCC) features were identified in 54 % of the tumors. These were smaller and more likely to present as acute appendicitis than appendiceal adenocarcinoma (AA), but were otherwise similar in clinical presentation and outcome. The presence of lymph node (LN) metastasis was associated with a higher risk of recurrence than of stage 2 appendix cancer (78 vs. 4 % at 5 years; p < 0.0001).

Gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors treated with high dose octreotide-LAR: a systematic literature review.,World journal of gastroenterology,World J. Gastroenterol.,2015-02-01,"To review literature on efficacy and safety of octreotide-long-acting repeatable (LAR) used at doses higher than the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved 30 mg/mo for treatment of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). We searched PubMed and Cochrane Library from 1998-2012, 5 conferences (American Society of Clinical Oncology, Endocrine Society, European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society, European Society for Medical Oncology, North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society) from 2000-2013 using MeSH and keyterms including neuroendocrine tumors, carcinoid tumor, carcinoma, neuroendocrine, and octreotide. Bibliographies of accepted articles were also searched. Two reviewers reviewed titles, abstracts, and full-length articles. Studies that reported data on efficacy and safety of ≥ 30 mg/mo octreotide-LAR for NETs in human subjects, published in any language were included in the review. The search identified 1086 publications, of which 238 underwent full-text review (20 were translated into English); 17 were included in the review. Studies varied in designs, subjects, octreotide-LAR regimens, and definition of outcomes. Eleven studies reported use of higher doses to control symptoms and tumor progression, although symptom severity and formal quality-of-life analysis were not quantitatively measured. Ten studies reported efficacy, describing 260 subjects with doses ranging from 40 mg/mo or 30 mg/3 wk up to 120 mg/mo. Eight studies reported expert clinical opinion that supported dose escalation of octreotide-LAR up to 60 mg/mo for symptom control and suggested increased doses may be effective at preventing tumor progression. Eight studies reported safety; there was no evidence of increased toxicity associated with doses of octreotide-LAR > 30 mg/mo. As reported in this review, octreotide-LAR at doses > 30 mg/mo is being prescribed for symptom and tumor control in NET patients.

Impact of Previous Somatostatin Analogue Use on the Activity of Everolimus in Patients with Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors: Analysis from the Phase III RADIANT-2 Trial.,Neuroendocrinology,Neuroendocrinology,2015-03-21,"The phase III placebo-controlled RADIANT-2 trial investigated the efficacy of everolimus plus octreotide long-acting repeatable (LAR) in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors (NET) associated with carcinoid syndrome. Here we report a secondary analysis based on the previous somatostatin analogue (SSA) exposure status of patients enrolled in RADIANT-2. Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral everolimus 10 mg/day plus octreotide LAR 30 mg intramuscularly (i.m.) or to receive matching placebo plus octreotide LAR 30 mg i.m. every 28 days. SSA treatment before study enrollment was permitted. Patient characteristics and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed by treatment arm and previous SSA exposure status. Of the 429 patients enrolled in RADIANT-2, 339 were previously exposed to SSA (95% received octreotide); 173 of 339 patients were in the everolimus plus octreotide LAR arm. All patients had a protocol-specified history of secretory symptoms, but analysis by type showed that more patients who previously received SSA therapy had a history of flushing symptoms (77%), diarrhea (86%), or both (63%) compared with SSA-naive patients (62, 62, and 24%, respectively). Patients who received everolimus plus octreotide LAR had longer median PFS regardless of previous SSA exposure (with: PFS 14.3 months, 95% confidence interval, CI, 12.0-20.1; without: 25.2 months, 95% CI, 12.0-not reached) compared with patients who received placebo plus octreotide LAR (with: 11.1 months, 95% CI, 8.4-14.6; without: 13.6 months, 95% CI, 8.2-22.7).

"Pazopanib and depot octreotide in advanced, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours: a multicentre, single-group, phase 2 study.",The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2015-05-05,"Treatment options for advanced, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) remain scarce. Pazopanib is an orally bioavailable, small molecule, multitargeted kinase inhibitor that inhibits VEGF receptors 1, 2, and 3. We did a study of the efficacy of pazopanib with depot octreotide in patients with advanced NETs. We did a parallel cohort study of patients with metastatic or locally advanced grade 1-2 carcinoid tumours or pancreatic NETs, by use of a single-group, two-stage design. Patients received pazopanib 800 mg orally once per day and octreotide at their preprotocol dosage. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving an objective response, as assessed by investigators, by intention-to-treat analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT00454363, and was completed in March, 2014. Between April 12, 2007, and July 2, 2009, we enrolled 52 patients, including 32 individuals with pancreatic NETs and 20 individuals with carcinoid tumours. Seven (21·9%, 95% CI 11·0-38·8) of 32 patients with pancreatic NETs achieved an objective response. We detected no responses in the first stage of the cohort with carcinoid tumours, and we terminated accrual at 20 patients. Toxic effects included one patient with grade 4 hypertriglyceridaemia and one with grade 4 thrombosis, with the most common grade three events being aminotransferase increases and neutropenia, each of which happened in 3 patients.

"Goblet cell carcinoid tumor, mixed goblet cell carcinoid-adenocarcinoma, and adenocarcinoma of the appendix: comparison of clinicopathologic features and prognosis.",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med.,2015-06-01,"The prognosis of appendiceal goblet cell carcinoid tumors (GCTs) is believed to be intermediate between appendiceal adenocarcinomas and conventional carcinoid tumors. However, GCTs can have mixed morphologic patterns, with variable amount of adenocarcinoma. To evaluate the behavior of GCTs and related entities with variable components of adenocarcinoma. We classified 74 cases of appendiceal tumors into 3 groups: group 1, GCTs or GCTs with less than 25% adenocarcinoma; group 2, GCTs with 25% to 50% adenocarcinoma; group 3, GCTs with more than 50% adenocarcinoma; and a comparison group of 68 adenocarcinomas without a GCT component (group 4). Well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinomas were excluded. Clinicopathologic features and follow-up were obtained from computerized medical records and the US Social Security Death Index. Of the 142 tumors studied, 23 tumors (16%) were classified as group 1; 27 (19%) as group 2; 24 (17%) as group 3; and 68 (48%) as group 4. Staging and survival differed significantly among these groups. Among 140 patients (99%) with available staging data, stages II, III, and IV were present in 87%, 4%, and 4% of patients in group 1 patients; 67%, 7%, and 22% of patients in group 2; 29%, 4%, and 67% of patients in group 3; and 19%, 6%, and 75% of patients in group 4, respectively (P = .01). Mean (SD) overall survival was 83.8 (34.6), 60.6 (30.3), 45.6 (39.7), and 33.6 (27.6) months for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (P = .01).

All patients with a diagnosis of primary pulmonary carcinoid tumor treated from 1989 to 2009 were reviewed. Data collected included demographics, pathology, tobacco use, clinical presentation, tumor location, tumor spread, treatment, and survival. There were 59 cases of pulmonary carcinoid tumors: 47 typical (80%) and 12 atypical (20%). All but 4 patients underwent surgery, including 54 (92%) lung-sparing resections and 1 pneumonectomy.

Octreotide long-acting repeatable among elderly patients with neuroendocrine tumors: a survival analysis of SEER-Medicare data.,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev.,2015-08-27,"Octreotide long-acting repeatable (LAR) is approved in the United States for the management of carcinoid syndromes among patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NET). The objective of our study is to evaluate the impact of octreotide LAR on overall survival (OS), as it has not been established. NET patients of 65 years and older diagnosed between January 1999 and December 2009 were identified from the SEER-Medicare database. We compared the OS of NET patients who started octreotide LAR within 12 months of diagnosis with those who did not receive it during the same period. We conducted Kaplan-Meier estimations and Cox proportional hazard models to examine the association between octreotide LAR and OS. Among 1,176 distant stage patients, 233 (20%) received octreotide LAR within 12 months of diagnosis, compared with 2% (96 in 5,764) of local/regional stage patients. Median OS for patients who started octreotide LAR within 12 months was 35.22 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 27.96-47.77], longer than those who did not receive it (19.15 months; 95% CI, 16.36-22.80; P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that octreotide LAR was associated with significant survival improvement for distant stage patients (HR, 0.68; P < 0.001) and in the subgroups with (HR, 0.65; P, 0.003) and without (HR, 0.55; P, 0.002) carcinoid syndrome.

Phase III study of pasireotide long-acting release in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors and carcinoid symptoms refractory to available somatostatin analogues.,"Drug design, development and therapy",Drug Des Devel Ther,2015-09-03,"In a randomized, double-blind, Phase III study, we compared pasireotide long-acting release (pasireotide LAR) with octreotide long-acting repeatable (octreotide LAR) in managing carcinoid symptoms refractory to first-generation somatostatin analogues. Adults with carcinoid tumors of the digestive tract were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive pasireotide LAR (60 mg) or octreotide LAR (40 mg) every 28 days. Primary outcome was symptom control based on frequency of bowel movements and flushing episodes. Objective tumor response was a secondary outcome. Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated in a post hoc analysis. Adverse events were recorded. At the time of a planned interim analysis, the data monitoring committee recommended halting the study because of a low predictive probability of showing superiority of pasireotide over octreotide for symptom control (n=43 pasireotide LAR, 20.9%; n=45 octreotide LAR, 26.7%; odds ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27-1.97; P=0.53). Tumor control rate at month 6 was 62.7% with pasireotide and 46.2% with octreotide (odds ratio, 1.96; 95% CI, 0.89-4.32; P=0.09). Median (95% CI) PFS was 11.8 months (11.0 - not reached) with pasireotide versus 6.8 months (5.6 - not reached) with octreotide (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.20-0.98; P=0.045). The most frequent drug-related adverse events (pasireotide vs octreotide) included hyperglycemia (28.3% vs 5.3%), fatigue (11.3% vs 3.5%), and nausea (9.4% vs 0%). We conclude that, among patients with carcinoid symptoms refractory to available somatostatin analogues, similar proportions of patients receiving pasireotide LAR or octreotide LAR achieved symptom control at month 6. Pasireotide LAR showed a trend toward higher tumor control rate at month 6, although it was statistically not significant, and was associated with a longer PFS than octreotide LAR.

Octreotide LAR Dosage and Survival Among Elderly Patients With Distant-Stage Neuroendocrine Tumors.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2016-02-24,"Octreotide long-acting repeatable (LAR) is approved for the management of carcinoid syndromes and may improve progression-free survival of patients with well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). It is unknown whether the dosage of octreotide LAR affects survival. This paper evaluates the association between initial octreotide LAR dosage and overall survival of elderly patients with NETs. Patients with distant-stage NET diagnosed between January 1999 and December 2009 who received octreotide LAR treatment within 12 months of diagnosis were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. Those under age 65 years, enrolled in health maintenance organizations, or without continuous enrollment in Medicare Parts A and B were excluded. We compared the 5-year survival of patients with NET based on dose per 28 days averaged over the initial 3 months: low (≤20 mg); medium (21-30 mg); high (>30 mg). Kaplan-Meier estimations and Cox proportional hazard modeling were used to examine the association between octreotide LAR dose and survival. Among 222 patients with distant-stage NET who received octreotide LAR treatment, 81 (36%) received a low dosage, 82 (37%) received a medium dosage, and only 59 (27%) received a high dosage. Multivariate analysis showed that compared with a medium octreotide LAR dose, a low dosage was associated with significantly worse survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.00; p = .001), whereas a high initial dosage (HR: 1.09; p = .719) did not show additional survival benefits over that observed with a medium dosage.

Next-Generation Sequencing of Pulmonary Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma Reveals Small Cell Carcinoma-like and Non-Small Cell Carcinoma-like Subsets.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2016-03-09,"Pulmonary large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) is a highly aggressive neoplasm, whose biologic relationship to small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) versus non-SCLC (NSCLC) remains unclear, contributing to uncertainty regarding optimal clinical management. To clarify these relationships, we analyzed genomic alterations in LCNEC compared with other major lung carcinoma types. LCNEC (n = 45) tumor/normal pairs underwent targeted next-generation sequencing of 241 cancer genes by Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) platform and comprehensive histologic, immunohistochemical, and clinical analysis. Genomic data were compared with MSK-IMPACT analysis of other lung carcinoma histologies (n = 242). Commonly altered genes in LCNEC included TP53 (78%), RB1 (38%), STK11 (33%), KEAP1 (31%), and KRAS (22%). Genomic profiles segregated LCNEC into 2 major and 1 minor subsets: SCLC-like (n = 18), characterized by TP53+RB1 co-mutation/loss and other SCLC-type alterations, including MYCL amplification; NSCLC-like (n = 25), characterized by the lack of coaltered TP53+RB1 and nearly universal occurrence of NSCLC-type mutations (STK11, KRAS, and KEAP1); and carcinoid-like (n = 2), characterized by MEN1 mutations and low mutation burden. SCLC-like and NSCLC-like subsets revealed several clinicopathologic differences, including higher proliferative activity in SCLC-like tumors (P < 0.0001) and exclusive adenocarcinoma-type differentiation marker expression in NSCLC-like tumors (P = 0.005). While exhibiting predominant similarity with lung adenocarcinoma, NSCLC-like LCNEC harbored several distinctive genomic alterations, including more frequent mutations in NOTCH family genes (28%), implicated as key regulators of neuroendocrine differentiation. LCNEC is a biologically heterogeneous group of tumors, comprising distinct subsets with genomic signatures of SCLC, NSCLC (predominantly adenocarcinoma), and rarely, highly proliferative carcinoids. Recognition of these subsets may inform the classification and management of LCNEC patients.

Will clinical heterogeneity of neuroendocrine tumors impact their management in the future? Lessons from recent trials.,Current opinion in oncology,Curr Opin Oncol,2016-07-01,"Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a group of biologically and clinically heterogeneous neoplasms arising from the diffuse neuroendocrine system. In the last few years, advances in our understanding of the biology of these tumors have translated into an expansion of treatment options for patients with NETs. Current treatment modalities include somatostatin analogs (SSAs), radiolabeled SSAs, targeted agents, cytotoxic drugs and liver-directed therapies for the management of metastatic disease. Recent studies have expanded the role of SSAs in gastroenteropancreatic (GEP)-NETs, and everolimus has shown robust antitumor activity across a broad range of NETs of the lung and GEP tract. The radiolobeled SSA Lu-DOTATATE has been investigated in a randomized phase III trial, and has demonstrated exceptional efficacy and tolerability in patients with progressive midgut NETs. The new serotonin inhibitor telotristat etiprate has shown significant activity in the palliation of symptoms of carcinoid syndrome, and its approval by regulatory authorities is expected soon. The field of NETs has been transformed from one dominated by limited treatment options to one characterized by an increasing number of therapeutic agents and active clinical trials.

A Phase II Trial of a Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Panobinostat in Patients With Low-Grade Neuroendocrine Tumors.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2016-06-03,"Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors versus carcinoid tumors should be examined separately in clinical trials.Progression-free survival is more clinically relevant as the primary endpoint (rather than response rate) in phase II trials for low-grade neuroendocrine tumors. The most common subtypes of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are pancreatic islet cell tumors and carcinoids, which represent only 2% of all gastrointestinal malignancies. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have already been shown to suppress tumor growth and induce apoptosis in various malignancies. In NET cells, HDAC inhibitors have resulted in increased Notch1 expression and subsequent inhibition of growth. We present here a phase II study of the novel HDAC inhibitor panobinostat in patients with low-grade NET. Adult patients with histologically confirmed, metastatic, low-grade NETs and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤2 were treated with oral panobinostat 20 mg once daily three times per week. Treatment was continued until patients experienced unacceptable toxicities or disease progression. The study was stopped at planned interim analysis based on a Simon two-stage design. Fifteen patients were accrued, and 13 were evaluable for response. No responses were seen, but the stable disease rate was 100%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 9.9 months, and the median overall survival was 47.3 months.

Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Lung: Current Challenges and Advances in the Diagnosis and Management of Well-Differentiated Disease.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2016-11-24,"Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) comprise a heterogeneous group of malignancies that arise from neuroendocrine cells throughout the body, most commonly originating from the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Lung NETs can be classified as well differentiated (low-grade typical carcinoids [TCs] and intermediate-grade atypical carcinoids [ACs]) and poorly differentiated (high-grade large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma or SCLC). The incidence of these tumors is increasing, but disease awareness remains low among thoracic specialists, who are often involved in the diagnosis and early treatment for these patients. An accurate and timely diagnosis can ensure the implementation of appropriate treatment and have a substantial impact on prognosis. However, lung NET classification and diagnosis, particularly for TCs/ACs, are complicated by several factors, including a variable natural history and nonspecific symptoms. Surgery remains the only curative option for TCs/ACs, but there is a lack of consensus between lung NET management guidelines regarding optimal treatment approaches in the unresectable/metastatic setting on account of the limited availability of high-level clinical evidence. As a result, a multidisciplinary approach to management of lung NETs is required to ensure a consistent and optimal level of care. RADIANT-4 is the first phase III trial involving a large subpopulation of patients with advanced well-differentiated lung NETs to report reductions in the risk for disease progression and death with everolimus over placebo. This led to the recent U.S. approval of everolimus-the first agent approved for advanced lung TCs/ACs.

Frequency of carcinoid syndrome at neuroendocrine tumour diagnosis: a population-based study.,The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2017-02-24,"Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) can secrete bioactive amines into the bloodstream, causing carcinoid syndrome, with symptoms including flushing and diarrhoea. However, carcinoid syndrome frequency in the NET population has never been rigorously assessed, nor has its relationship to presenting clinicopathological characteristics. This analysis assessed the proportion of patients with NETs and carcinoid syndrome in the USA and associated clinical factors. We identified patients (≥65 years of age) from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database, excluding those with pancreatic tumours or small-cell or large-cell lung cancer, as well as those without complete data. We assessed the incidence of patients with at least two insurance claims of flushing, diarrhoea, or carcinoid syndrome during the 3 months before and after NET diagnosis. We compared demographic and clinical characteristics between patients with and without carcinoid syndrome using χ<sup>2</sup> tests. We used the Cochran-Armitage trend test to identify trends in carcinoid syndrome incidence and Cox regression to assess the relationship between carcinoid syndrome and survival. Between April 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2011, 9512 eligible patients were diagnosed with NETs, of whom 1786 (19%) had carcinoid syndrome. The number of patients with NETs and carcinoid syndrome increased from 50 (11%) of 465 patients in 2000 to 160 (19%) of 854 in 2011 (p<0·0001). The proportion of patients with carcinoid syndrome compared with those without did not differ significantly with respect to age at diagnosis (p=0·65), geographical region (p=0·054), or urban versus rural status (p=0·53). Patients with carcinoid syndrome were more frequently female than male (p=0·0003). Race was associated with a significant difference in the reported incidence of carcinoid syndrome (p<0·0001), as was tumour grade, stage, and primary tumour site (all p<0·0001). Patients with carcinoid syndrome had a shorter overall survival (median 5 years [95% CI 4·5-5·4]) than did those without carcinoid syndrome (5·6 years [5·4-5·9]; hazard ratio 1·102 [1·016-1·194]; p=0·019). Use of octreotide (p<0·0001) and chemotherapy (p=0·003) were more common in patients with carcinoid syndrome than in those without it, whereas surgery was used more frequently in patients without carcinoid syndrome (p=0·009); use of radiotherapy was not significantly associated with the presence of carcinoid syndrome at diagnosis (p=0·07). This population-based analysis reveals that carcinoid syndrome is significantly associated with tumour grade, stage, and primary tumour site, and leads to shorter survival compared with those patients without carcinoid syndrome.

Retrospective review of serotonergic medication tolerability in patients with neuroendocrine tumors with biochemically proven carcinoid syndrome.,Cancer,Cancer,2017-03-07,"Patients with carcinoid tumors frequently could benefit from the pharmacologic treatment of depression and anxiety. However, many prescribers avoid serotonergic medications due to the theoretical risk of exacerbating carcinoid syndrome. The authors conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with carcinoid tumors and elevated serotonin levels (as measured by 24-hour urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid [5-HIAA]) at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center who initiated treatment with serotonergic antidepressants after a carcinoid diagnosis from 2003 to 2016. Each medication regimen was categorized based on the presence of adverse interactions as defined by clinical worsening of symptoms of carcinoid syndrome in the absence of progressive disease that temporally correlated with a serotonergic medication trial. A total of 73 serotonergic regimens received by 52 patients were included in the primary analysis. Among these medication trials, 8.2% of the regimens (6 regimens) were categorized as being associated with a likely adverse interaction, 61.6% of the regimens (45 regimens) were categorized as having no adverse reaction, 9.6% of the regimens (7 regimens) were categorized as an unlikely adverse reaction, and 20.6% of the regimens (15 regimens) were categorized as unknown. It is interesting to note that none of the 73 trials resulted in a carcinoid crisis requiring emergency care or hospitalization. Only 3 patients discontinued serotonergic medications due to worsening carcinoid syndrome. Serotonergic medications appear to be a safe option for the treatment of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the majority of patients with neuroendocrine tumors and carcinoid syndrome. In the current study, <10% of patients developed a combination of flushing, diarrhea, and bloating after the initiation of serotonergic medications. Clinicians can begin with low doses, monitor these symptoms, and reduce the dose or discontinue the medication if necessary.

Carcinoid Syndrome and Costs of Care During the First Year After Diagnosis of Neuroendocrine Tumors Among Elderly Patients.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2017-06-22,"Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) can secrete hormonal peptides that lead to additional symptom burdens. However, it is largely unknown whether and to what extent the additional symptom burdens translate into higher costs of care. This study aimed to examine the cost pattern of elderly NET patients during the first year of diagnosis, taking into account of the carcinoid syndrome status. We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Medicare data to identify elderly NET patients diagnosed between January 2003 and December 2011. Patients who had at least two claims indicative of carcinoid syndrome during the 3 months before and after the NET diagnosis were considered to have carcinoid syndrome. We adopted a payer's perspective and quantified economic outcomes using the following three measures: (a) total Medicare reimbursement amount, (b) inpatient amount, and (c) outpatient amount. We used a generalized linear model (GLM) to examine the association between syndrome and costs. Our study cohort included 6,749 elderly NET well-differentiated and moderately differentiated patients. Of these patients, 5,633 (83%) were alive 1 year after diagnosis with continuous enrollment, and 1,116 (17%) died within 1 year. The multivariable GLM showed significant association between the syndrome and higher total, inpatient, and outpatient costs among the group who survived the whole year; the association was insignificant among the group who died within the first year of diagnosis. This population-based study showed that NET patients with carcinoid syndrome incurred higher costs of care especially among those who survived the first year of diagnosis.

Pulmonary large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma with adenocarcinoma-like features: napsin A expression and genomic alterations.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2017-09-08,"Pulmonary large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) is a highly aggressive malignancy, which was recently found to comprise three major genomic subsets: small cell carcinoma-like, non-small cell carcinoma (predominantly adenocarcinoma)-like, and carcinoid-like. To further characterize adenocarcinoma-like subset, here we analyzed the expression of exocrine marker napsin A, along with TTF-1, in a large series of LCNECs (n=112), and performed detailed clinicopathologic and genomic analysis of napsin A-positive cases. For comparison, we analyzed napsin A expression in other lung neuroendocrine neoplasms (177 carcinoids, 37 small cell carcinomas) and 60 lung adenocarcinomas. We found that napsin A was expressed in 15% of LCNEC (17/112), whereas all carcinoids and small cell carcinomas were consistently negative. Napsin A reactivity in LCNEC was focal in 12/17 cases, and weak or moderate in intensity in all cases, which was significantly lower in the extent and intensity than seen in adenocarcinomas (P<0.0001). The combination of TTF-1-diffuse/napsin A-negative or focal was typical of LCNEC but was rare in adenocarcinoma, and could thus serve as a helpful diagnostic clue. The diagnosis of napsin A-positive LCNECs was confirmed by classic morphology, diffuse labeling for at least one neuroendocrine marker, most consistently synaptophysin, and the lack of distinct adenocarcinoma component. Genomic analysis of 14 napsin A-positive LCNECs revealed the presence of mutations typical of lung adenocarcinoma (KRAS and/or STK11) in 11 cases. In conclusion, LCNECs are unique among lung neuroendocrine neoplasms in that some of these tumors exhibit low-level expression of exocrine marker napsin A, and harbor genomic alterations typical of adenocarcinoma. Despite the apparent close biological relationship, designation of adeno-like LCNEC as a separate entity from adenocarcinoma is supported by their distinctive morphology, typically diffuse expression of neuroendocrine marker(s) and aggressive behavior.

Ten patients were identified. The median age at presentation was 38 years (range, 20-77 years), and 8 were women. One patient presented with carcinoid-like symptoms, 2 were diagnosed incidentally, and 7 presented with symptoms related to mass effect. The median size of the tumor was 7.0 cm (range, 3-12 cm). On pathologic review, 3 of 10 were low-grade and well-differentiated, 5 of 10 were intermediate-grade and well-differentiated, 2 of 10 were grade 3 and classified as high-grade and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumors. Seven cases were metastatic on presentation with lymph node, liver, lung, or skeletal metastasis. Seven of 8 cases were detectable using Octreoscan. Eight patients were treated with a somatostatin analog and 5 patients were treated surgically. Presacral NENs are clinically similar to gastroenteropancreatic tumors.

J. Surg. Pathol.,2018-07-01,"Goblet cell carcinoid tumors are amphicrine tumors whose biological behavior ranges from indolent to highly aggressive, depending on tumor grade. Current grading systems for these tumors are based on identifying an adenocarcinoma arising in the setting of a goblet cell carcinoid tumor, which distinguishes this tumor from other gastrointestinal tract adenocarcinomas. Because goblet cell tumors are predominantly tumors of mucin secreting cells, we propose that they be classified as goblet cell adenocarcinomas, and graded using a methodology that has parallels in colorectal adenocarcinoma grading. We graded a large series of goblet cell adenocarcinomas by assessing the proportion of the tumor that demonstrates tubular or clustered growth. Histologic grade correlated with overall survival independent of stage, with median overall survival of 204, 86, and 29 months for low-grade, intermediate-grade, and high-grade goblet cell adenocarcinomas, respectively.

Systemic therapy in non-conventional cancers of the larynx.,Oral oncology,Oral Oncol.,2018-05-26,"Laryngeal cancer (LC) remains a challenging disease to treat. The majority of LCs diagnosed worldwide are squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), and current treatment guidelines are designed to address conventional laryngeal SCC. However, several histologically rare tumor types can originate in the larynx. There is a lack of guidelines regarding the best therapeutic approaches to these tumors and their treatment is often modeled after their recommended management at non-laryngeal sites.

Prognostic Impact of Serum Pancreastatin Following Chemoembolization for Neuroendocrine Tumors.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2018-09-04,"The objective of this study was to investigate the prognostic impact of the biomarker serum pancreastatin in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Patients with metastatic NET treated with TACE at a single institution from 2000 to 2013 were analyzed. Patient demographics, response to therapy, and long-term survival were compared with baseline pancreastatin level and changes in pancreastatin levels after TACE. A total of 188 patients underwent TACE during the study period. An initial pancreastatin level greater than 5000 pg/mL correlated with worse overall survival (OS) from time of first TACE (median OS, 58.5 vs. 22.1 months, p < 0.001). A decrease in pancreastatin level by 50% or more after TACE treatment correlated with improved OS (median OS 53.8 vs. 29.9 months, p = 0.032). Patients with carcinoid syndrome were more likely to have a subsequent increase in pancreastatin after initial drop post-TACE (78.1 vs. 55.2%, p = 0.002). Patients with an increase in pancreastatin levels after initial drop post-TACE were more likely to have liver progression on imaging (70.7 vs. 40.7%, p = 0.005) and more likely to need repeat TACE (21.1 vs. 6.7%, p = 0.009). For patients with liver metastases from NET treated with TACE, pancreastatin measurement may be a useful prognostic indicator.

Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors.,CA: a cancer journal for clinicians,CA Cancer J Clin,2018-10-08,"Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are heterogeneous malignancies arising from the diffuse neuroendocrine system. They frequently originate in the gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) tract and the bronchopulmonary tree, and their incidence has steadily increased in the last 3 decades. Fundamental biologic and genomic differences underlie the clinical heterogeneity of NETs, and distinct molecular features characterize NETs of different grades and different primary sites. Although surgery remains the cornerstone of treatment for localized tumors, systemic treatment options for patients with metastatic NETs have expanded considerably. Somatostatin analogs have demonstrated both antisecretory and antitumor efficacy. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with lutetium-177 dotatate (<sup>177</sup> Lu-DOTATATE) has been approved for advanced GEP-NETs. The antitumor activity of everolimus has been demonstrated across a wide spectrum of NETs, and the antiangiogenic agent sunitinib has been approved for pancreatic NETs (pNETs). Chemotherapy with temozolomide and capecitabine has recently demonstrated an unprecedented prolongation of progression-free survival in a randomized trial of pNETs. Multiple retrospective series have reported the efficacy of liver-directed therapies both for palliating symptoms of hormone excess and for controlling tumor growth.

Influence of carcinoid syndrome on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors undergoing operative resection.,Surgery,Surgery,2018-10-28,"The incidence, clinical characteristics, and long-term outcomes of patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendrocrine tumors and carcinoid syndrome undergoing operative resection have not been well characterized. Patients undergoing resection of primary or metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendrocrine tumors between 2000 and 2016 were identified from an 8-institution collaborative database. Clinicopathologic and postoperative characteristics as well as overall survival and disease-free survival were compared among patients with and without carcinoid syndrome. Among 2,182 patients who underwent resection, 139 (6.4%) had preoperative carcinoid syndrome. Patients with carcinoid syndrome were more likely to have midgut primary tumors (44.6% vs 21.4%, P < .001), lymph node metastasis (63.4% vs 44.3%, P < .001), and metastatic disease (62.8% vs 26.7%, P < .001). There was no difference in tumor differentiation, grade, or Ki67 status. Perioperative carcinoid crisis was rare (1.6% vs 0%, P < .01), and the presence of preoperative carcinoid syndrome was not associated with postoperative morbidity (38.8% vs 45.5%, P = .129). Substantial symptom improvement was reported in 59.5% of patients who underwent curative-intent resection, but occurred in only 22.7% who underwent debulking. Despite an association on univariate analysis (P = .04), carcinoid syndrome was not independently associated with disease-free survival after controlling for confounding factors (hazard ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.64-1.45). Preoperative carcinoid syndrome was not associated with overall survival on univariate or multivariate analysis. Among patients undergoing operative resection of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendrocrine tumors, the prevalence of preoperative carcinoid syndrome was low.

This study assessed change in CS symptoms and QoL in patients treated with somatostatin analogs (SSAs) using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29 instruments. Patients ≥18 years old with CS symptoms and treated with SSA or non-SSA agents in the United States were recruited through a patient advocacy group to complete a two-part, anonymous online survey. Time point (T) 1 survey was fielded from July-October 2016, and T2 survey followed 6 months later. Clinical characteristics and SSA treatment duration were assessed at T1. FACT-G and PROMIS-29 QoL surveys were administered and CS symptoms were assessed at T1 and T2; proportions of patients not experiencing symptoms were compared by McNemar's test. Healthcare resource utilization (HRU) was assessed for the T1-T2 interval, and mean difference in QoL score from T1 to T2 by SSA duration was calculated. Of 117 participants at T1, 89 (76%) completed the T2 survey and served as the study sample; 11 (13%) were treated with SSAs for > 0-2 years, 37 (42%) for > 2-5 years, and 39 (45%) for > 5 years. A higher proportion of patients at T2 vs. T1 reported the following symptoms as not applicable: diarrhea (16% vs. 7%, p < 0.05), flushing (28% vs. 18%, p < 0.05), wheezing (78% vs 66%, p = 0.008). Most patients (89%) had a physical exam and a mean of 7.2 healthcare provider visits between T1 and T2. Patients treated with SSAs for ≤2 years had a mean positive change of 3.7 in their FACT-G total score between surveys, and 6.0 in an additional set of CS-specific questions. Patients receiving SSAs for > 2 years did not appear to associate with a clinically meaningful improvement in QoL score as assessed by FACT-G between T1 and T2; patients also had no clinically meaningful improvement as assessed by PROMIS-29.

Carcinoid tumor of lung and BRCA mutation: a case report.,Journal of medical case reports,J Med Case Rep,2019-05-01,"A BRCA mutation is a mutation in either of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, which are tumor suppressor genes. Hundreds of different types of mutations in these genes have been identified, some of which have been determined to be harmful, whereas others have no proven impact. BRCA mutations are well known to be associated with breast, uterine, and ovarian cancers along with some nongynecological malignancies involving the peritoneum, prostate, pancreas, skin, stomach, and rectum. However, there are no reported cases to date of an association between carcinoid tumors and a BRCA mutation. Our patient was a 33-year-old White woman with BRCA2 mutation who presented to her primary care physician for evaluation of abdominal pain. She underwent computed tomography of her abdomen and pelvis, which showed an incidental finding of infrahilar mass along with renal stones. Further workup with bronchoscopy and biopsy of the mass confirmed it to be a carcinoid tumor of the lung. No literature thus far exists describing a connection between BRCA mutations and carcinoid tumors. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment of carcinoid tumors are proven to have impact on survival and prognosis of these patients.",Case Reports,265.0,0.0,A BRCA mutation is a mutation in either of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes which are tumor suppressor genes Hundreds of different types of mutations in these genes have been identified some of which have been determined to be harmful whereas others have no proven impact BRCA mutations are well known to be associated with and cancers along with some nongynecological malignancies involving the peritoneum and rectum However there are no reported cases to date of an association between tumors and a BRCA mutation Our patient was a 33-year-old White woman with BRCA2 mutation who presented to her primary care physician for evaluation of abdominal pain She underwent computed tomography of her abdomen and pelvis which showed an incidental finding of infrahilar mass along with stones Further workup with bronchoscopy and biopsy of the mass confirmed it to be a tumor of the No literature thus far exists describing a connection between BRCA mutations and tumors Early diagnosis and prompt treatment of tumors are proven to have impact on survival and prognosis of these patients,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[8, 1555, 258, 16, 8, 258, 4, 361, 1, 3, 766, 15, 1167, 214, 92, 32, 30, 1245, 214, 9035, 1, 338, 630, 1, 138, 4, 46, 214, 47, 85, 108, 476, 1, 92, 47, 85, 509, 6, 40, 12530, 547, 1749, 47, 77, 1930, 345, 1555, 138, 32, 149, 440, 6, 40, 41, 5, 2, 163, 1510, 5, 476, 47520, 441, 1267, 3, 6699, 2, 3660, 137, 125, 32, 77, 210, 140, 6, 1244, 1, 35, 248, 59, 57, 2, 8, 1555, 258, 114, 69, 10, 8, 466, 111, 1095, 886, 2854, 5, 1167, 258, 54, 917, 6, 1084, 86, 165, 1473, 9, 451, 1, 1467, 559, 3109, 208, 1220, 872, 1, 1084, 4036, 2, 3270, 92, 224, 35, 4490, 1567, 1, 74742, 782, 1510, 5, 21948, 195, 4755, 5, 11570, 2, 411, 1, 3, 782, 557, 192, 6, 40, 8, 30, 1, 3, 77, 789, 631, 3272, 2481, 4950, 8, 10158, 59, 1555, 138, 2, 57, 191, 147, 2, 4776, 24, 1, 57, 32, 1930, 6, 47, 345, 23, 25, 2, 356, 1, 46, 7]",1072.0,31039815,75
