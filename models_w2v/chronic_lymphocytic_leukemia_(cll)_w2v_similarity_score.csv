The mechanism of tumor cell clearance by rituximab in vivo in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia: evidence of caspase activation and apoptosis induction.,Blood,Blood,2002-02-01,"Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed at CD20 with significant activity in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). A variety of pathways of tumor cytotoxicity different from cytotoxic chemotherapy have been proposed for this therapeutic antibody including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-mediated cell lysis. This report describes that a proportion of patients with CLL receiving rituximab treatment have in vivo activation of caspase-9, caspase-3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage in blood leukemia cells immediately following infusion of rituximab. This suggests that apoptosis using a pathway similar to fludarabine and other chemotherapeutic agents is intricately involved in the blood elimination of tumor cells after rituximab treatment. Patients having caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage in vivo had a significantly lower blood leukemia cell count after treatment as compared to those without caspase activation. Significant down-modulation of the antiapoptotic proteins XIAP and Mcl-1 was also noted, possibly explaining in part how rituximab sensitizes CLL cells to the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy in vivo. These findings suggest that the therapeutic benefit of antibody-based therapy in vivo for patients with CLL depends in part on induction of apoptosis and provides another area of focus for studying mechanisms of antibody-resistance in neoplastic cells.",Clinical Trial,6563.0,329.0,Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed at CD20 with significant activity in NHL and chronic lymphocytic CLL A variety of pathways of tumor cytotoxicity different from cytotoxic chemotherapy have been proposed for this therapeutic antibody including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-mediated cell lysis This report describes that a proportion of patients with CLL receiving rituximab treatment have in vivo activation of caspase-9 caspase-3 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase PARP cleavage in blood cells immediately following infusion of rituximab This suggests that apoptosis using a pathway similar to fludarabine and other chemotherapeutic agents is intricately involved in the blood elimination of tumor cells after rituximab treatment Patients having caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage in vivo had a significantly lower blood cell count after treatment as compared to those without caspase activation Significant down-modulation of the antiapoptotic proteins XIAP and Mcl-1 was also noted possibly explaining in part how rituximab sensitizes CLL cells to the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy in vivo These findings suggest that the therapeutic benefit of antibody-based therapy in vivo for patients with CLL depends in part on induction of apoptosis and provides another area of focus for studying mechanisms of antibody-resistance in neoplastic cells,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[855, 16, 8, 2897, 848, 548, 1166, 28, 2198, 5, 93, 128, 4, 1176, 2, 442, 1193, 552, 8, 1362, 1, 460, 1, 30, 1408, 338, 29, 759, 56, 47, 85, 1587, 9, 26, 189, 548, 141, 548, 470, 763, 1408, 2, 3731, 517, 31, 4783, 26, 414, 2677, 17, 8, 920, 1, 7, 5, 552, 357, 855, 24, 47, 4, 386, 363, 1, 1469, 83, 1469, 27, 2, 2699, 3638, 3507, 1451, 2041, 3155, 4, 315, 37, 3467, 366, 904, 1, 855, 26, 844, 17, 351, 75, 8, 308, 288, 6, 2027, 2, 127, 1573, 183, 16, 52711, 646, 4, 3, 315, 3730, 1, 30, 37, 50, 855, 24, 7, 1041, 1469, 27, 363, 2, 2041, 3155, 4, 386, 42, 8, 97, 280, 315, 31, 1276, 50, 24, 22, 72, 6, 135, 187, 1469, 363, 93, 1328, 2356, 1, 3, 4176, 652, 5387, 2, 1308, 14, 10, 120, 1051, 2150, 8290, 4, 760, 832, 855, 6229, 552, 37, 6, 3, 759, 254, 1, 56, 4, 386, 46, 272, 309, 17, 3, 189, 247, 1, 548, 90, 36, 4, 386, 9, 7, 5, 552, 3828, 4, 760, 23, 504, 1, 351, 2, 777, 1809, 965, 1, 1222, 9, 4559, 483, 1, 548, 251, 4, 2000, 37]",1393.0,11807010,87

Conceptual aspects of combining rituximab and Campath-1H in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2002-02-01,"Monoclonal antibody-based therapy has emerged as a novel approach in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. The safety and tolerability of monoclonal antibodies make these compounds attractive and easy to administer, even in elderly, heavily pretreated patients. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is an incurable disease with few therapeutic options once patients fail purine analogue-based therapy. Two monoclonal antibodies have shown activity in this disease. The first is rituximab (Rituxan; Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, CA, and IDEC Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA), a chimeric human-mouse anti-CD20 antibody. The second is Campath-1H, a humanized form of a rat antibody active against CD52. We hypothesize that combining both antibodies in patients who have failed conventional therapies and express both CD20 and CD52 might have enhanced efficacy and therapeutic benefit.

CD20-directed serotherapy in patients with multiple myeloma: biologic considerations and therapeutic applications.,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",J. Immunother.,,"Clonotypic B cells circulating in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) express CD20, and it has been suggested that these cells may be clonogenic. Furthermore, 20% of patients with MM express CD20 on their bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs). Therefore, the authors began a phase II clinical study to determine the activity of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab in MM patients. Nineteen previously treated MM patients received 375 mg/m2 rituximab per week for 4 weeks. Three months after initiation of treatment, patients were assessed for response and received a second course of therapy if their disease was stable (SD) or they achieved a partial response (PR). Six of 19 (32%) patients had either a PR (n = 1) or SD (n = 5), with a median time to treatment failure of 5.5 months (mean, 10.3 months; range, 3-27+ months). All six patients who had a PR or SD had CD20+ BMPC. Overall, rituximab therapy was well tolerated. Because most patients with MM poorly express CD20 on their BMPCs, the authors evaluated agents for their ability to induce CD20 expression and thereby facilitate rituximab binding on MM cells. These studies show that interferon-gamma (IFN-y) induced CD20 expression on MM BMPCs, MM B cells, and healthy donor BMPCs. In contrast, CD20 expression on chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, healthy donor B cells, and progenitor cells was unaffected by IFN-y. Rituximab binding to the BMPCs of MM patients was also increased after culture with pharmacologically attainable levels of IFN-gamma (1-100 U/mL). In conclusion, these studies suggest that MM patients with CD20+ BMPCs may benefit from rituximab therapy. Furthermore, IFN-gamma induces CD20 expression on MM BMPCs and B cells and facilitates rituximab binding to MM BMPCs, providing the rationale for clinical trials to examine its use with CD20-directed serotherapies in MM.",Clinical Trial,,126.0,Clonotypic B cells circulating in patients with multiple MM express CD20 and it has been suggested that these cells may be clonogenic Furthermore 20 of patients with MM express CD20 on their marrow plasma cells BMPCs Therefore the authors began a phase II clinical study to determine the activity of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab in MM patients Nineteen previously treated MM patients received 375 mg/m2 rituximab per week for 4 weeks Three months after initiation of treatment patients were assessed for response and received a second course of therapy if their disease was stable SD or they achieved a partial response PR Six of 19 32 patients had either a PR n 1 or SD n 5 with a median time to treatment failure of 5.5 months mean 10.3 months range 3-27+ months All six patients who had a PR or SD had CD20+ BMPC Overall rituximab therapy was well tolerated Because most patients with MM poorly express CD20 on their BMPCs the authors evaluated agents for their ability to induce CD20 expression and thereby facilitate rituximab binding on MM cells These studies show that interferon-gamma IFN-y induced CD20 expression on MM BMPCs MM B cells and healthy donor BMPCs In contrast CD20 expression on chronic lymphocytic follicular 's healthy donor B cells and progenitor cells was unaffected by IFN-y Rituximab binding to the BMPCs of MM patients was also increased after culture with pharmacologically attainable levels of IFN-gamma 1-100 U/mL In conclusion these studies suggest that MM patients with CD20+ BMPCs may benefit from rituximab therapy Furthermore IFN-gamma induces CD20 expression on MM BMPCs and B cells and facilitates rituximab binding to MM BMPCs providing the rationale for clinical trials to examine its use with CD20-directed serotherapies in MM,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[10959, 132, 37, 1033, 4, 7, 5, 232, 321, 1669, 2198, 2, 192, 71, 85, 1148, 17, 46, 37, 68, 40, 3798, 798, 179, 1, 7, 5, 321, 1669, 2198, 23, 136, 581, 554, 37, 17623, 673, 3, 738, 4603, 8, 124, 215, 38, 45, 6, 223, 3, 128, 1, 3, 312, 2198, 848, 548, 855, 4, 321, 7, 3498, 373, 73, 321, 7, 103, 4175, 81, 821, 855, 379, 647, 9, 39, 244, 169, 53, 50, 1118, 1, 24, 7, 11, 275, 9, 51, 2, 103, 8, 419, 906, 1, 36, 492, 136, 34, 10, 585, 1270, 15, 491, 513, 8, 450, 51, 998, 437, 1, 326, 531, 7, 42, 361, 8, 998, 78, 14, 15, 1270, 78, 33, 5, 8, 52, 98, 6, 24, 496, 1, 33, 33, 53, 313, 79, 27, 53, 184, 27, 428, 53, 62, 437, 7, 54, 42, 8, 998, 15, 1270, 42, 2198, 16202, 63, 855, 36, 10, 149, 421, 408, 96, 7, 5, 321, 1240, 1669, 2198, 23, 136, 17623, 3, 738, 194, 183, 9, 136, 801, 6, 1290, 2198, 55, 2, 2267, 1876, 855, 791, 23, 321, 37, 46, 94, 514, 17, 1688, 1705, 1256, 2055, 277, 2198, 55, 23, 321, 17623, 321, 132, 37, 2, 1331, 1488, 17623, 4, 748, 2198, 55, 23, 442, 1193, 1974, 292, 1331, 1488, 132, 37, 2, 2520, 37, 10, 4585, 20, 1256, 2055, 855, 791, 6, 3, 17623, 1, 321, 7, 10, 120, 101, 50, 2099, 5, 7854, 15100, 148, 1, 1256, 1705, 14, 394, 1767, 542, 4, 1221, 46, 94, 309, 17, 321, 7, 5, 2198, 17623, 68, 247, 29, 855, 36, 798, 1256, 1705, 1516, 2198, 55, 23, 321, 17623, 2, 132, 37, 2, 4936, 855, 791, 6, 321, 17623, 1736, 3, 1728, 9, 38, 143, 6, 1004, 211, 119, 5, 2198, 1166, 52806, 4, 321]",1783.0,11924912,65
Frequency and type of serious infections in fludarabine-refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma: implications for clinical trials in this patient population.,Cancer,Cancer,2002-04-01,"Treatments for fludarabine-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) are limited. Most new therapies being examined in fludarabine-refractory patients have shown a high frequency of serious infection. Little data exist regarding the frequency of infections in this population treated with noninvestigational best supportive care therapies. The infectious courses of 27 patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL/SLL were retrospectively reviewed. Fludarabine-refractoriness was defined as either relapse within six months of completion of or failure to respond to fludarabine treatment. Infections were documented after patients met National Cancer Institute criteria for further treatment. Serious infections were defined as infections mandating admission to the hospital for intravenous antibiotics. Patient characteristics included: median age 67 years (range, 40-83), median 3 chemotherapy treatments (range, 1-8), and hypogammaglobulinemia in 73% of patients. Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis was given to 89% of patients. Serious infections developed in 24 out of 27 patients (89%). Patients had a median of 2 admissions (range, 0-11) for serious infection occurring at a median of 4 months (range, 0-21) from onset of fludarabine-refractoriness. The median frequency of admission for infection was 0.17 per month. Most common sites for infection in decreasing frequency were: respiratory tract, urinary tract, blood/sepsis, and soft tissues. Bacteria caused 69 out of 88 infections (78.4%); viruses (varicella-zoster and herpes simplex) caused 11 out of 88 (12.5%); fungi caused 4 out of 88 (4.5%); and opportunistic infections caused 4 out of 88 (4.5%). Median survival was 13.0 months (range, 1-44+). The frequency of serious infections in patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL/SLL is high. These findings are relevant to trials with new and highly effective agents for which the incidence of serious infections after treatment might otherwise appear to be prohibitively high.",Journal Article,6504.0,124.0,Treatments for fludarabine-refractory chronic lymphocytic CLL /small lymphocytic SLL are limited Most new therapies being examined in fludarabine-refractory patients have shown a high frequency of serious infection Little data exist regarding the frequency of infections in this population treated with noninvestigational best supportive care therapies The infectious courses of 27 patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL/SLL were retrospectively reviewed Fludarabine-refractoriness was defined as either relapse within six months of completion of or failure to respond to fludarabine treatment Infections were documented after patients met National Cancer Institute criteria for further treatment Serious infections were defined as infections mandating admission to the hospital for intravenous antibiotics Patient characteristics included median age 67 years range 40-83 median 3 chemotherapy treatments range 1-8 and hypogammaglobulinemia in 73 of patients Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis was given to 89 of patients Serious infections developed in 24 out of 27 patients 89 Patients had a median of 2 admissions range 0-11 for serious infection occurring at a median of 4 months range 0-21 from onset of fludarabine-refractoriness The median frequency of admission for infection was 0.17 per month Most common sites for infection in decreasing frequency were respiratory tract urinary tract blood/sepsis and soft tissues Bacteria caused 69 out of 88 infections 78.4 viruses varicella-zoster and herpes simplex caused 11 out of 88 12.5 fungi caused 4 out of 88 4.5 and opportunistic infections caused 4 out of 88 4.5 Median survival was 13.0 months range 1-44+ The frequency of serious infections in patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL/SLL is high These findings are relevant to trials with new and highly effective agents for which the incidence of serious infections after treatment might otherwise appear to be prohibitively high,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[640, 9, 2027, 430, 442, 1193, 552, 302, 1193, 5302, 32, 383, 96, 217, 235, 486, 409, 4, 2027, 430, 7, 47, 443, 8, 64, 675, 1, 1762, 930, 1215, 74, 1923, 666, 3, 675, 1, 1875, 4, 26, 266, 73, 5, 37128, 824, 1877, 165, 235, 3, 3398, 1993, 1, 428, 7, 5, 2027, 430, 552, 5302, 11, 894, 446, 2027, 12483, 10, 395, 22, 361, 429, 262, 437, 53, 1, 1438, 1, 15, 496, 6, 1892, 6, 2027, 24, 1875, 11, 1405, 50, 7, 543, 657, 12, 1377, 371, 9, 195, 24, 1762, 1875, 11, 395, 22, 1875, 21014, 3411, 6, 3, 702, 9, 1262, 5214, 69, 374, 159, 52, 89, 598, 60, 184, 327, 852, 52, 27, 56, 640, 184, 14, 66, 2, 13242, 4, 803, 1, 7, 13243, 21967, 2049, 10, 447, 6, 887, 1, 7, 1762, 1875, 276, 4, 259, 1205, 1, 428, 7, 887, 7, 42, 8, 52, 1, 18, 5565, 184, 13, 175, 9, 1762, 930, 1821, 28, 8, 52, 1, 39, 53, 184, 13, 239, 29, 1707, 1, 2027, 12483, 3, 52, 675, 1, 3411, 9, 930, 10, 13, 269, 379, 811, 96, 186, 633, 9, 930, 4, 2777, 675, 11, 2718, 1696, 1660, 1696, 315, 4227, 2, 1214, 742, 8841, 1546, 790, 1205, 1, 889, 1875, 833, 39, 4405, 17098, 11398, 2, 4716, 7241, 1546, 175, 1205, 1, 889, 133, 33, 30222, 1546, 39, 1205, 1, 889, 39, 33, 2, 10026, 1875, 1546, 39, 1205, 1, 889, 39, 33, 52, 25, 10, 233, 13, 53, 184, 14, 584, 3, 675, 1, 1762, 1875, 4, 7, 5, 2027, 430, 552, 5302, 16, 64, 46, 272, 32, 867, 6, 143, 5, 217, 2, 561, 323, 183, 9, 92, 3, 287, 1, 1762, 1875, 50, 24, 822, 2632, 1322, 6, 40, 24436, 64]",1941.0,11932906,206

Pharmacol.,2002-04-27,"Fludarabine is a renally excreted agent that is an effective treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a disease predominantly of the elderly. We sought to determine whether age, renal function or pretreatment hematologic status predicted toxicity of fludarabine treatment for CLL. We evaluated 192 patients with previously untreated B-cell CLL who were entered onto the fludarabine treatment arm (25 mg/m(2) daily for 5 days every 28 days) of CALGB study 9011, an intergroup study with participation from SWOG, CTG/NCI-C and ECOG. Patients were required to have serum creatinine within 1.5 times normal. Hematologic indices and infections were recorded during the first 28-day cycle of treatment. A time-to-toxicity endpoint was evaluated over the entire course of fludarabine treatment. Creatinine clearance (CrCl(est)) was estimated using serum creatinine, age and body mass index. The median age was 64 years (range 37-87 years) and median CrCl(est) was 62 ml/min (range 27-162 ml/min, interquartile range 52-79 ml/min). We found no association between age and incidence of hematologic toxicity or infection during the first cycle of treatment. There was a strong association between CrCl(est) and the time-to-toxicity endpoint. Patients with CrCl(est) below 80 ml/min had increased incidence of toxicity during their treatment course ( P<0.0001). Pretreatment anemia, thrombocytopenia and Rai stage were highly associated with the incidence of neutrophil toxicity and grade III/IV hematologic toxicities during the first cycle of treatment ( P<0.0001).

Cancer Res.,2002-07-01,"DX-8951f is a novel hexacyclic camptothecin-analogue topoisomerase I inhibitor with both in vitro antileukemic activity and myelosuppression as a dose-limiting toxicity in solid tumor Phase I studies. DX-8951f is active in a human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) severe combined immunodeficient mouse model. In a leukemia Phase I study, we investigated the toxicity profile and pharmacokinetics of DX-8951f in patients with primary refractory or relapsed AML or acute lymphocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, or chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase (CML-BP). DX-8951f was given as an i.v. infusion over 30 min daily for 5 or 7 days. The starting dose was 0.6 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days (3.0 mg/m(2)/course). Courses were given every 3-4 weeks according to toxicity and antileukemic efficacy. Twenty-five patients (AML, 21 patients; myelodysplastic syndrome, 1 patient; acute lymphocytic leukemia, 2 patients; CML-BP, 1 patient) were treated.

The clinical significance of tumor necrosis factor-alpha plasma level in patients having chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2002-08-01,"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a cytokine possessing pleiotropic biological activities, is produced by leukemic lymphocytes in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acts as an autocrine and paracrine growth factor in this disease. In this study, TNF-alpha levels were determined in 150 patients with CLL and correlated with disease characteristics, prognostic factors, and survival. The mean TNF-alpha plasma concentration in the patients with CLL was significantly higher than in the healthy control population (16.4 versus 8.7 pg/mL; P <.0001). Patients having an elevated TNF-alpha level had more advanced Rai and Binet stage disease, higher serum beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)M) levels, a greater percentage of cells expressing CD38, and lower hemoglobin and platelet levels. Patients having chromosomal abnormalities such as 11q deletion, trisomy 12, and chromosome 17 aberrations had a higher mean TNF-alpha level (27.5 pg/mL) than patients having a diploid karyotype or other miscellaneous cytogenetic abnormalities (14.2 pg/mL; P <.001). The TNF-alpha level was a predictor of survival when the Cox proportional hazards model was used with TNF-alpha entered as a continuous variable (P =.0001). Also, patients having a TNF-alpha level above the mean value of 14 pg/mL had significantly shorter survival duration (P =.00001). The TNF-alpha level remained predictive of survival in Cox multivariate analysis independent of Rai staging and beta(2)M, hemoglobin, prior therapy, white cell count, and platelet level (P =.005).

Identification of tumor-associated antigens in chronic lymphocytic leukemia by SEREX.,Blood,Blood,2002-09-01,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is associated with a variety of immunologic disturbances. Hypogammaglobulinemia and autoimmune phenomena are both often present in this disease. In contrast, humoral or cellular antitumor responses are rarely observed. It has been previously shown that antigens detected in patients with malignant diseases can provide information regarding intracellular molecules engaged in the transformation process and can identify tumor antigens that may be useful for development of immunotherapeutic strategies. Serologic identification by recombinant expression cloning (SEREX) has been demonstrated to be a useful method to detect tumor and tumor-associated antigens in a variety of malignancies. Although this approach is complicated in CLL, we used a modified SEREX approach and identified 14 antigens (KW-1 to KW-14) using this methodology. Several clones showed a restricted expression pattern in normal tissues. Moreover, distinctive expression of splice variants and aberrant gene expression in malignant tissue were detected. In this study, 6 antigens were detected exclusively in patients with CLL. Eight antigens were detected also in lymphoma patients. Healthy donors showed antibody responses against only 3 of the identified antigens. T cells with specific cytotoxicity against peptides derived from the 2 antigens tested could be generated from healthy donors. These findings demonstrate that humoral and cellular immune responses against CLL-associated antigens can be detected.

Farnesyltransferase inhibitors and myeloid malignancies: phase I evidence of Zarnestra activity in high-risk leukemias.,Seminars in hematology,Semin. Hematol.,2002-07-01,"Acute leukemia carries a poor prognosis, especially in older patients, emphasizing the need for novel therapies. Reasons for treatment failure include high rates of relapse and treatment-related toxicities. Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs), a new class of agents that can interfere with intracellular signaling, are good therapeutic candidates for study in these diseases, given the relatively high levels of the target enzyme, farnesyltransferase, expressed in bone marrow and by peripheral circulating lymphocytes. ZARNESTRA (formerly R115777, Ortho Biotech Oncology, Raritan, NJ) is an FTI that has clinical activity in solid tumors and antileukemic activity in vitro. In a phase I trial of Zarnestra in patients with high-risk leukemia (resistant or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia [AML] or acute lymphocytic leukemia [ALL], chronic myeloid leukemia [CML] in blast crisis, or AML in poor prognosis subgroups), patients experienced an overall response rate of 29%.

To establish a case definition, to describe management, and to identify risk factors for fludarabine-related pulmonary toxicity. Case-control study. Tertiary-care US Army teaching hospital. Individuals treated with fludarabine at our institution between January 1989 and June 2000. Cases of fludarabine-related pulmonary toxicity were defined as follows: dyspnea, fever, hypoxemia, and radiographic infiltrates seen in a patient treated with fludarabine; cases were excluded if there was evidence of pulmonary infection or progression of underlying lymphoproliferative disease affecting the lungs. For each case, demographic data, medical history, radiographic information, available bronchoscopy and pathology data, and details of treatment were reviewed. Cases were compared with fludarabine-treated control subjects to identify potential risk factors. Comparisons were made with regard to age, gender, history of underlying lung disease, lymphoproliferative diagnosis, prior chemotherapy, fludarabine treatment regimen, and pretreatment chest radiograph. During the study period, 105 patients were treated with fludarabine. The incidence of fludarabine-related pulmonary toxicity using our definition was 8.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.2 to 13.9%). One patient died before this entity was suspected; the remainder of the patients underwent bronchoscopy to exclude infection. Patients were treated with corticosteroids with subjective and objective benefits. One patient later died of apparent infection during steroid therapy. One patient was retreated with fludarabine and symptoms of lung toxicity developed again. Patients (n = 9) were similar to control subjects (n = 96) with respect to age, gender, history of underlying lung disease, previous chemotherapy, and fludarabine regimen. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia were 13.3 (95% CI, 1.6 to 300.6) times more likely to have toxicity develop than patients treated with fludarabine for other diagnoses. There was a trend toward an increased incidence in patients with interstitial infiltrates apparent on prefludarabine chest radiographs. A variety of lung conditions arise in patients treated with fludarabine; however, this agent seems to cause direct pulmonary toxicity. After performing an appropriate evaluation to exclude infection, corticosteroids are an effective therapy.

Clin. Oncol.,2002-09-01,"Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) may have disease transformation to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or prolymphocytic leukemia; however, development of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) is unusual. A series of patients enrolled onto an intergroup CLL trial were examined for this complication. A total of 544 previously untreated B-cell CLL patients were enrolled onto a randomized intergroup study comparing treatment with chlorambucil, fludarabine, or fludarabine plus chlorambucil. Case report forms from 521 patients were reviewed for t-AML. With a median follow-up of 4.2 years, six patients (1.2%) to date have developed therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS; n = 3), t-AML (n = 2), or t-MDS evolving to t-AML (n = 1), from 27 to 53 months (median, 34 months) after study entry. This included five (3.5%) of 142 patients treated with fludarabine plus chlorambucil and one (0.5%) of 188 receiving fludarabine; no chlorambucil-treated patients developed t-MDS or t-AML (P =.007). At study entry, the median age among these six patients was 56 years (range, 44 to 72 years); three were male; the CLL Rai stage was I/II (n = 4) or III/IV (n = 2). Response to CLL therapy was complete (n = 4) or partial remission (n = 1) and stable disease (n = 1). Marrow cytogenetics, obtained in three of six cases at diagnosis of t-MDS or t-AML, were complex, with abnormalities in either or both chromosomes 5 and 7. Other abnormalities involved chromosomes X, 1, 8, 12, 17, and 19. Median survival after diagnosis of t-MDS/AML was 3.5 months (range, 0.5 to 10.1 months).

"Randomized phase 2 study of fludarabine with concurrent versus sequential treatment with rituximab in symptomatic, untreated patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia: results from Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9712 (CALGB 9712).",Blood,Blood,2002-07-05,"Recent studies have suggested that rituximab has clinical activity and modulates antiapoptotic proteins associated with drug resistance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We performed a randomized phase 2 study to determine the efficacy, safety, and optimal administration schedule of rituximab with fludarabine in previously untreated CLL patients. Patients were randomized to receive either 6 monthly courses of fludarabine concurrently with rituximab followed 2 months later by 4 weekly doses of rituximab for consolidation therapy or sequential fludarabine alone followed 2 months later by rituximab consolidation therapy. A total of 104 patients were randomized to the concurrent (n = 51) and sequential (n = 53) regimens. During the induction portion of treatment, patients receiving the concurrent regimen experienced more grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (74% versus 41%) and grade 3 or 4 infusion-related toxicity (20% versus 0%) as compared with the sequential arm. The consolidation rituximab therapy was tolerated well in both arms. All other toxicities were similar in the 2 arms. The overall response rate with the concurrent regimen was 90% (47% complete response [CR], 43% partial response [PR]; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82-0.98) compared with 77% (28% CR, 49% PR; 95% CI, 0.66-0.99) with the sequential regimen.

Hormone replacement therapy and risk of non-hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev.,2002-11-01,"Our objective in this study was to evaluate whether the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). A cohort of 37,220 Iowa women ages 55 to 69 years in 1986 with no history of prior cancer was linked annually to a population-based cancer registry. Through 1998 (13 years of follow-up), 258 incident cases of NHL were identified, including 135 cases of diffuse NHL, 58 cases of follicular NHL, and 31 cases of small lymphocytic NHL. In addition, 63 cases of CLL were identified. Current and former use of HRT (primarily estrogen) and other cancer risk factors were self-reported on the baseline (1986) questionnaire. Compared with never users of HRT at study baseline, current [multivariate relative risk (RR), 1.4; 95% confidence intervals (CIs), 0.9-2.0) but not former (RR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8-1.4) users were at increased risk of NHL after adjustment for age and other confounding factors. This association was seen only in nodal NHL [RR(current), 1.5 (95% CI, 1.0-2.4); RR(former), 1.1 (95% CI, 0.8-1.6)] and was not apparent for extra-nodal sites. Of the common subtypes, there was a strong positive association with follicular NHL [RR(current), 3.3 (95% CI, 1.6-6.9); RR(former), 2.6 (95% CI, 1.4-4.7)], and women who were current users for more than 5 years had the highest risk (RR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.8-8.6). There was no association with diffuse or small lymphocytic NHL, or with CLL. Most of the follicular NHLs were nodal (88%), and exclusion of extra-nodal sites slightly strengthened the association with HRT. For diffuse NHL, 64% of the cases were nodal, and there was no association of HRT with either nodal or extra-nodal sites. These data suggest that HRT is a risk factor for follicular NHL but not for diffuse or small lymphocyte NHL or CLL.",Comparative Study,6290.0,43.0,"Our objective in this study was to evaluate whether the use of hormone replacement therapy HRT is associated with NHL or chronic lymphocytic CLL A cohort of 37,220 Iowa women ages 55 to 69 years in 1986 with no history of prior cancer was linked annually to a population-based cancer registry Through 1998 13 years of follow-up 258 incident cases of NHL were identified including 135 cases of diffuse NHL 58 cases of follicular NHL and 31 cases of small lymphocytic NHL In addition 63 cases of CLL were identified Current and former use of HRT primarily estrogen and other cancer risk factors were self-reported on the baseline 1986 questionnaire Compared with never users of HRT at study baseline current multivariate relative risk RR 1.4 95 confidence intervals CIs 0.9-2.0 but not former RR 1.1 95 CI 0.8-1.4 users were at increased risk of NHL after adjustment for age and other confounding factors This association was seen only in nodal NHL RR current 1.5 95 CI 1.0-2.4 RR former 1.1 95 CI 0.8-1.6 and was not apparent for extra-nodal sites Of the common subtypes there was a strong positive association with follicular NHL RR current 3.3 95 CI 1.6-6.9 RR former 2.6 95 CI 1.4-4.7 and women who were current users for more than 5 years had the highest risk RR 3.9 95 CI 1.8-8.6 There was no association with diffuse or small lymphocytic NHL or with CLL Most of the follicular NHLs were nodal 88 and exclusion of extra-nodal sites slightly strengthened the association with HRT For diffuse NHL 64 of the cases were nodal and there was no association of HRT with either nodal or extra-nodal sites These data suggest that HRT is a risk factor for follicular NHL but not for diffuse or small lymphocyte NHL or CLL",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[114, 461, 4, 26, 45, 10, 6, 376, 317, 3, 119, 1, 785, 3892, 36, 5315, 16, 41, 5, 1176, 15, 442, 1193, 552, 8, 180, 1, 567, 6211, 8565, 117, 2165, 614, 6, 790, 60, 4, 3751, 5, 77, 532, 1, 324, 12, 10, 1199, 4226, 6, 8, 266, 90, 12, 1608, 298, 1850, 233, 60, 1, 166, 126, 8289, 2631, 140, 1, 1176, 11, 108, 141, 3978, 140, 1, 1388, 1176, 717, 140, 1, 1974, 1176, 2, 456, 140, 1, 302, 1193, 1176, 4, 352, 676, 140, 1, 552, 11, 108, 291, 2, 3623, 119, 1, 5315, 1561, 808, 2, 127, 12, 43, 130, 11, 1074, 210, 23, 3, 330, 3751, 1770, 72, 5, 1737, 2735, 1, 5315, 28, 45, 330, 291, 331, 580, 43, 861, 14, 39, 48, 307, 1582, 1927, 13, 83, 18, 13, 84, 44, 3623, 861, 14, 14, 48, 58, 13, 66, 14, 39, 2735, 11, 28, 101, 43, 1, 1176, 50, 1852, 9, 89, 2, 127, 4339, 130, 26, 248, 10, 527, 158, 4, 779, 1176, 861, 291, 14, 33, 48, 58, 14, 13, 18, 39, 861, 3623, 14, 14, 48, 58, 13, 66, 14, 49, 2, 10, 44, 2235, 9, 3420, 779, 633, 1, 3, 186, 814, 125, 10, 8, 1082, 109, 248, 5, 1974, 1176, 861, 291, 27, 27, 48, 58, 14, 49, 49, 83, 861, 3623, 18, 49, 48, 58, 14, 39, 39, 67, 2, 117, 54, 11, 291, 2735, 9, 80, 76, 33, 60, 42, 3, 1076, 43, 861, 27, 83, 48, 58, 14, 66, 66, 49, 125, 10, 77, 248, 5, 1388, 15, 302, 1193, 1176, 15, 5, 552, 96, 1, 3, 1974, 11440, 11, 779, 889, 2, 4721, 1, 3420, 779, 633, 3223, 12766, 3, 248, 5, 5315, 9, 1388, 1176, 660, 1, 3, 140, 11, 779, 2, 125, 10, 77, 248, 1, 5315, 5, 361, 779, 15, 3420, 779, 633, 46, 74, 309, 17, 5315, 16, 8, 43, 161, 9, 1974, 1176, 84, 44, 9, 1388, 15, 302, 1448, 1176, 15, 552]",1715.0,12433728,82

Education Program,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,2002-01-01,"This update of early stage B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) embraces current information on the diagnosis, biology, and intervention required to more fully develop algorithms for management of this disease. Emphasis on early stage is based on the rapid advancement in our understanding of the disease parameters and our increasing ability to predict for a given early stage patient whether there is a need for more aggressive management. In Section I, Dr. Terry Hamblin addresses the nature of the disease, accurate diagnostic procedures, evidence for an early ""preclinical"" phase, the use of newer prognostic features to distinguish who will be likely to progress or not, and whether it is best to watch or treat early stage disease. In Section II, Dr. Neil Kay and colleagues address the biologic aspects of the disease and how they may relate to disease progression. Review of the newer insights into gene expression, recurring genetic defects, role of cytokines/autocrine pathways, and the interaction of the CLL B cell with the microenvironment are emphasized. The relationship of these events to both trigger disease progression and as opportunities for future therapeutic intervention even in early stage disease is also considered. In Section III, Dr. John Byrd and colleagues review the historical and now current approaches to management of the previously untreated progressive B-CLL patient. They discuss what decision tree could be used in the initial decision to treat a given patient. The use of single agents versus newer combination approaches such as chemoimmunotherapy are discussed here. In addition, the place of marrow transplant and some of the newer antibodies available for treatment of B-CLL are considered.

Circulating CD20 is detectable in the plasma of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and is of prognostic significance.,Blood,Blood,2002-11-21,"CD20 is a 33- to 36-kDa transmembrane phosphoprotein involved in the activation, proliferation, and differentiation of B lymphocytes. The predicted amino acid sequence of the CD20 suggests 4 transmembrane-spanning regions with both N- and C-termini located in the cytoplasm. We demonstrate herein that significant levels of circulating CD20 (cCD20) can be detected in the plasma of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and that cCD20 interferes with the binding of rituximab, a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, to CLL cells. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to measure circulating cCD20 levels in the plasma. We measured cCD20 levels in the plasma of 180 patients with CLL and correlated these levels with clinical characteristics and outcome. Circulating CD20 levels correlated positively with beta(2)-microglobulin level (p =.006) and percentage of CD38(+) cells (p =.03) and negatively with platelet count (p =.004) and hemoglobin level (p =.02). Patients with advanced Rai (III/IV) or Binet (C) stage disease had significantly higher levels of cCD20 than did patients with earlier-stage disease (P =.01 and P =.006, respectively). There was no correlation between cCD20 level and age, lymphocyte count, or white blood cell count.

Epoetin alfa as a supportive measure in hematologic malignancies.,Seminars in hematology,Semin. Hematol.,2002-10-01,"Anemia is prevalent among cancer patients with hematologic malignancies, with fatigue and weakness, major symptoms of anemia, contributing to diminished quality of life (QOL). Data from several randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials and three large community-based studies in patients with hematologic malignancies indicate that recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO, epoetin alfa) can correct anemia, reduce transfusion requirements, and improve QOL. Moreover, a positive relationship has been found between increased hemoglobin (Hb) levels and improvements in QOL assessments, regardless of disease state, with the greatest incremental improvement occurring when Hb increases from 11 g/dL to 12 g/dL (range, 11 to 13 g/dL). This suggests that patients with mild-to-moderate anemia may achieve the greatest QOL benefit from epoetin alfa therapy. Evidence from community-based studies suggests that epoetin alfa administered once weekly has a similar safety and efficacy profile as three-times-weekly administration. Further research is ongoing with less frequent dosing regimens. The beneficial effects of epoetin alfa therapy have been reported in studies involving patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), multiple myeloma, and lymphomas.

The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of fludarabine phosphate in patients with renal impairment: a prospective dose adjustment study.,Cancer investigation,Cancer Invest.,2002-01-01,"A significant number of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Waldenström's macroglobulinemia patients, treated with fludarabine phosphate (fludarabine), are elderly with diminished renal function. Since the kidney eliminates approximately 60% of fludarabine's primary metabolite (F-ara-A), dose modification is necessary for all patients with impaired renal function including elderly patients. In this study, 22 patients with varying levels of renal function received a single intravenous dose of fludarabine (25 mg/m3), followed one week later by five (one per day) doses that were adjusted according to three predefined creatinine clearance (CLcr) levels.

Phase II study of cladribine and cyclophosphamide in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and prolymphocytic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2003-01-01,"One of the mechanisms of action of cladribine is the inhibition of DNA repair of damage caused by radiation, alkylating agents, or other drugs. To determine its antitumor activity in combination with cyclophosphamide, we initiated a Phase II trial of the two agents in patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL). Twenty-nine patients with refractory or recurrent CLL or PLL received cladribine 4 mg/m(2)/day and cyclophosphamide 350 mg/m(2)/day (both administered intravenously) for 3 days every 4 weeks. Eleven patients (38%), nine with CLL and two with PLL, had a response. The median duration of response was 12 months. Severe extrahematologic toxicity (National Cancer Institute Grade 3-4) occurred in two patients, consisting of skin rash in one patient and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in the other. The most common form of hematologic toxicity was severe neutropenia, which developed after 25% of the 84 courses was administered. Severe thrombocytopenia and anemia developed after 12% and 7% of the courses, respectively, and five episodes of anemia were immunomediated.

Unconjugated antibodies show significant efficacy in the treatment of breast cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Promising new targets for unconjugated antibody therapy include cellular growth factor receptors, receptors or mediators of tumor-driven angiogenesis, and B cell surface antigens other than CD20. Immunoconjugates composed of antibodies conjugated to radionuclides or toxins show efficacy in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. One immunoconjugate containing an antibody and a chemotherapy agent exhibits clinically meaningful antitumor activity in acute myeloid leukemia. Numerous efforts to exploit the ability of antibodies to focus the activities of toxic payloads at tumor sites are under way and show early promise. The ability to create essentially human antibody structures has reduced the likelihood of host-protective immune responses that otherwise limit the duration of therapy. Antibody structures now can be readily manipulated to facilitate selective interaction with host immune effectors.

Eradication of systemic B-cell tumors by genetically targeted human T lymphocytes co-stimulated by CD80 and interleukin-15.,Nature medicine,Nat. Med.,2003-02-10,"The genetic transfer of antigen receptors provides a means to rapidly generate autologous tumor-reactive T lymphocytes. However, recognition of tumor antigens by cytotoxic T cells is only one step towards effective cancer immunotherapy. Other crucial biological prerequisites must be fulfilled to expand tumor-reactive T cells that retain a functional phenotype, including in vivo cytolytic activity and the ability to travel to tumor sites without prematurely succumbing to apoptosis. We show that these requirements are met by expanding peripheral blood T cells genetically targeted to the CD19 antigen in the presence of CD80 and interleukin-15 (IL-15).

High expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and splice variants is a distinctive feature of poor-prognosis chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2003-02-13,"In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), analysis of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions for somatic hypermutation identifies 2 prognostic subsets, mutated and unmutated. Investigators have postulated that unmutated and mutated CLL arises from malignant transformation of pre- and post-germinal center (GC) B cells, respectively. Alternatively, unmutated cases may arise from B cells stimulated by T-cell-independent antigens or from GC B cells with inactive somatic hypermutation. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a protein essential for somatic hypermutation, is expressed by GC B cells in which this process occurs. We investigated AID mRNA expression in 20 CLL cases. In 8 cases we detected high expression of wild-type AID mRNA and 2 splice variants; in 12 cases and 5 normal peripheral blood B-cell samples we detected no expression using standard conditions.

Depsipeptide (FR901228) induces histone acetylation and inhibition of histone deacetylase in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells concurrent with activation of caspase 8-mediated apoptosis and down-regulation of c-FLIP protein.,Blood,Blood,2003-03-20,"Depsipeptide is in clinical trials for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) on the basis of earlier observations demonstrating selective in vitro activity in CLL. We sought to determine the relationship of histone H3 and H4 acetylation, inhibition of histone deacetylase, and apoptosis observed in CLL cells to justify a pharmacodynamic end point in these clinical trials. We demonstrate that in vitro depsipeptide induces histone H3 and H4 acetylation and histone deacetylase enzyme inhibition at concentrations corresponding to the LC50 (concentration producing 50% cell death) for cultured CLL cells (0.038 microM depsipeptide). The changes in histone acetylation are lysine specific, involving H4 K5, H4 K12, and H3 K9, and to a lesser extent H4 K8, but not H4 K16 or H3 K14. Depsipeptide-induced apoptosis is caspase dependent, selectively involving the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (extrinsic pathway) initiating caspase 8 and effector caspase 3. Activation of caspase 8 was accompanied by the down-regulation of cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP, I-FLICE) without evidence of Fas (CD95) up-regulation.

Pentostatin and cyclophosphamide: an effective new regimen in previously treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2003-04-01,"Purine analogs and alkylators are important agents in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Previously, combinations of fludarabine and chlorambucil were abandoned because of increased toxicity from overlapping myelosuppression and immunosuppression. Of the purine analogs active in CLL, pentostatin may be least myelosuppressive. We hypothesized that combining pentostatin with cyclophosphamide would have less myelotoxicity than combinations using other purine analogs. We studied 23 patients with previously treated CLL. All patients received pentostatin 4 mg/m(2). Seventeen patients received cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2), and six patients received cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m(2). Both drugs were administered on day 1 of each cycle, and cycles were repeated every 3 weeks for six treatments. Filgrastim, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and acyclovir were administered prophylactically. The median number of prior treatment regimens was three (range, one to five) with 13 patients (57%) refractory to prior fludarabine therapy. The cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m(2) dose level was associated with moderate to severe nausea, and we chose cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) as the dose for further study. There were 17 responses (74%; 95% confidence interval, 63% to 85%), including four complete responses. The response rate was 77% in fludarabine-refractory patients. Myelosuppression was acceptable with grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, seen in 35% and 30% of patients, respectively. The relative sparing of thrombopoiesis can be seen in that only one patient (5%) with an initial platelet count of more than 20,000 required platelet transfusions while receiving therapy. Pentostatin 4 mg/m(2) with cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) is safe and effective in previously treated patients with CLL. On the basis of these results, we are currently studying pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (PCR) therapy in patients with CLL.",Journal Article,6139.0,90.0,"Purine analogs and alkylators are important agents in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic CLL Previously combinations of fludarabine and chlorambucil were abandoned because of increased toxicity from overlapping myelosuppression and immunosuppression Of the purine analogs active in CLL pentostatin may be least myelosuppressive We hypothesized that combining pentostatin with cyclophosphamide would have less myelotoxicity than combinations using other purine analogs We studied 23 patients with previously treated CLL All patients received pentostatin 4 mg/m 2 Seventeen patients received cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 and six patients received cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m 2 Both drugs were administered on day 1 of each cycle and cycles were repeated every 3 weeks for six treatments Filgrastim sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and acyclovir were administered prophylactically The median number of prior treatment regimens was three range one to five with 13 patients 57 refractory to prior fludarabine therapy The cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m 2 dose level was associated with moderate to severe nausea and we chose cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 as the dose for further study There were 17 responses 74 95 confidence interval 63 to 85 including four complete responses The response rate was 77 in fludarabine-refractory patients Myelosuppression was acceptable with grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia seen in 35 and 30 of patients respectively The relative sparing of thrombopoiesis can be seen in that only one patient 5 with an initial platelet count of more than 20,000 required platelet transfusions while receiving therapy Pentostatin 4 mg/m 2 with cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 is safe and effective in previously treated patients with CLL On the basis of these results we are currently studying pentostatin cyclophosphamide and rituximab PCR therapy in patients with CLL",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[5006, 4063, 2, 12777, 32, 305, 183, 4, 3, 24, 1, 442, 1193, 552, 373, 1247, 1, 2027, 2, 11585, 11, 13015, 408, 1, 101, 155, 29, 4551, 2858, 2, 3646, 1, 3, 5006, 4063, 544, 4, 552, 7596, 68, 40, 506, 11109, 21, 1237, 17, 1525, 7596, 5, 1112, 688, 47, 299, 17118, 76, 1247, 75, 127, 5006, 4063, 21, 656, 382, 7, 5, 373, 73, 552, 62, 7, 103, 7596, 39, 81, 188, 18, 3591, 7, 103, 1112, 2383, 81, 188, 18, 2, 437, 7, 103, 1112, 5310, 81, 188, 18, 110, 600, 11, 468, 23, 218, 14, 1, 296, 417, 2, 410, 11, 2113, 454, 27, 244, 9, 437, 640, 5552, 23152, 23151, 2, 17606, 11, 468, 21051, 3, 52, 207, 1, 324, 24, 472, 10, 169, 184, 104, 6, 365, 5, 233, 7, 696, 430, 6, 324, 2027, 36, 3, 1112, 5310, 81, 188, 18, 61, 301, 10, 41, 5, 1163, 6, 905, 1218, 2, 21, 6177, 1112, 2383, 81, 188, 18, 22, 3, 61, 9, 195, 45, 125, 11, 269, 253, 794, 48, 307, 268, 676, 6, 772, 141, 294, 236, 253, 3, 51, 116, 10, 849, 4, 2027, 430, 7, 2858, 10, 1595, 5, 88, 27, 39, 778, 2, 1340, 527, 4, 465, 2, 201, 1, 7, 106, 3, 580, 1851, 1, 33399, 122, 40, 527, 4, 17, 158, 104, 69, 33, 5, 35, 388, 1596, 1276, 1, 80, 76, 179, 984, 616, 1596, 4987, 369, 357, 36, 7596, 39, 81, 188, 18, 5, 1112, 2383, 81, 188, 18, 16, 1165, 2, 323, 4, 373, 73, 7, 5, 552, 23, 3, 877, 1, 46, 99, 21, 32, 694, 4559, 7596, 1112, 2, 855, 604, 36, 4, 7, 5, 552]",1875.0,12663715,354
Phase I trial of fludarabine and paclitaxel in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",Med. Oncol.,2003-01-01,"Fludarabine is an active agent in low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Paclitaxel is also active in patients with refractory lymphoma, and preclinical data suggest an additive effect with fludarabine in vitro. We performed a phase I trial of fludarabine (25 mg/m(2) d 1-3) plus a 3-h infusion of paclitaxel (125, 150, or 175 mg/m(2)) on d 3 every 28 d in 13 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The paclitaxel dose was escalated in cohorts of 3-4 patients using standard phase I design schema. Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as febrile neutropenia, platelet nadir less than 50,000/microL, or grade 3-4 nonhematologic toxicity. Thirteen patients were accrued to the study, 8 of these 13 patients (62%) had received prior chemotherapy. At the 125-, 150-, and 175-mg/m(2) dose levels of paclitaxel, dose-limiting toxicity occurred in 1/4, 0/4, and 0/4 patients, respectively. The single patient with dose-limiting toxicity had febrile neutropenia.

Gastrointestinal bleeding and epistaxis were the most common spontaneous symptoms. Bleeding time was prolonged in most patients, associated with marked reductions in plasma von Willebrand factor antigen and ristocetin cofactor activity. Plasma VWF multimer distribution was normal (type 1 pattern) in 5 patients, indeterminate (no multimers detectable) in 6 patients (type 3 pattern), and abnormal (decreased higher-molecular-weight multimers, type 2 pattern) in 11 patients.

Apoptotic-regulatory and complement-protecting protein expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: relationship to in vivo rituximab resistance.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2003-04-01,"Rituximab has clinical activity in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and has a variety of proposed mechanisms, including apoptosis, complement-dependent cell lysis (CDC), and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Here we examine pretreatment biologic features that promote resistance to apoptosis and CDC in CLL patients and correlate it with clinical outcome to rituximab-based therapy. Pretreatment samples from 21 CLL patients treated on a prospective, single-agent rituximab trial were examined for quantitative expression of apoptotic and CDC regulatory proteins, and the level of expression of these proteins was correlated with clinical outcome. Of the 21 patents for whom samples were available, 10 attained a partial response and 11 failed to respond to rituximab therapy. The mean pretreatment expression of Bcl-2, Mcl-1, XIAP, and the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax were higher but not statistically increased in nonresponding patients versus those responding to treatment. In contrast, the pretreatment Mcl-1/Bax ratio was significantly elevated (0.82 +/- 0.28 v 0.39 +/- 0.29, P <.016) in nonresponding patients compared with patients responding to rituximab therapy. Although pretreatment expression of CD55 and CD59 was not associated with response to rituximab therapy, significantly higher levels of CD59 were observed in the CLL cells that were not cleared from the blood at completion of therapy than the level observed at baseline levels (P =.02). These data indicate that baseline expression of the Mcl-1/Bax ratio, but not CD55 and CD59, predict for clinical response to rituximab therapy in CLL patients.

Palliative irradiation of the spleen.,American journal of clinical oncology,Am. J. Clin. Oncol.,2003-04-01,"We analyzed the efficacy of splenic irradiation in a population of patients with hematologic diseases. The records of the Radiation Oncology Division, Naval Medical Center San Diego were retrospectively reviewed for all patients treated with splenic irradiation (SI) between January 1, 1990 and March 1, 2001. The charts of 17 patients were identified: 5 patients had chronic myelogenous leukemia, 4 had chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 4 had idiopathic myelofibrosis, 2 had polycythemia vera, and 1 patient each had idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and acute myelogenous leukemia. Patient ages ranged from 37 to 88 years. Sixteen of 17 suffered from symptomatic splenomegaly. Twenty-six courses of splenic irradiation were delivered to these 17 patients. Treatment courses generally consisted of two fractions of 50 cGy in the first week, two fractions of 75 cGy the second week, and two fractions of 100 cGy the third week. Blood counts were checked prior to each treatment. Seven of the 17 patients died 1 month or less after SI due to the terminal nature of their disease. Twenty-two of 25 treatment courses for splenomegaly resulted in decreased pain and symptoms. Five patients required two treatment courses for splenomegaly, and one patient required five treatment courses. Three of four patients treated for thrombocytopenia demonstrated improvement, but only one was evaluable for more than 2 weeks due to disease-related mortality.

Uniform response criteria in Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia: consensus panel recommendations from the Second International Workshop on Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia.,Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2003-04-01,"Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) is a malignant disorder of lymphoplasmacytic cells that produce a monoclonal immunoglobulin M (IgM). Since the original description by Jan Waldenström of three patients with symptoms of hyperviscosity due to circulating monoclonal IgM, the definition of WM has been controversial. Standardized criteria for diagnosis have now been proposed, including the presence of any IgM monoclonal protein and marrow and/or nodal lymphoplasmacytic cells. Although previous response criteria have generally incorporated parameters for monoclonal protein reduction and/or improvement of marrow/nodal involvement, specific and uniform response criteria are needed to facilitate comparisons of response, remission duration, progression-free survival, and overall survival in clinical trials similar to those previously established for other diseases such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma.

Genetics and cytogenetics of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.,Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2003-04-01,"Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) is a clonal B-cell disorder characterized by the production of a monoclonal paraprotein and lymphoplasmacytic clonal expansion. The genetic basis of this disorder is poorly understood. We have recently found that the genetic makeup of WM cells is different from that commonly reported for multiple myeloma (MM), follicular lymphoma, and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IgH) translocations could not be detected in any case, and a molecular analysis showed that the IgH locus switch mu retained its germline configuration. Aneuploidy was not detected using chromosome enumeration probes. The only recurrent chromosome abnormality found was deletion of 6q21. The lack of legitimate of illegitimate rearrangements at the IgH locus suggests that other mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Given the clear evidence of a familial form of WM and the currently presumed genomic stability of the clonal cells, it is likely that a single gene defect may be responsible for disease pathogenesis. Having found deletions of the long arm of chromosome 6 as the only recurrent aberration, we speculate that a gene involved in B-cell maturation or survival at this locus may be inactivated as a cause of WM.",Journal Article,6139.0,18.0,Waldenstrom 's macroglobulinemia WM is a clonal B-cell disorder characterized by the production of a monoclonal paraprotein and lymphoplasmacytic clonal expansion The genetic basis of this disorder is poorly understood We have recently found that the genetic makeup of WM cells is different from that commonly reported for multiple MM follicular and B-cell chronic lymphocytic Translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus IgH translocations could not be detected in any case and a molecular analysis showed that the IgH locus switch mu retained its germline configuration Aneuploidy was not detected using chromosome enumeration probes The only recurrent chromosome abnormality found was deletion of 6q21 The lack of legitimate of illegitimate rearrangements at the IgH locus suggests that other mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of the disorder Given the clear evidence of a familial form of WM and the currently presumed genomic stability of the clonal cells it is likely that a single gene defect may be responsible for disease pathogenesis Having found deletions of the long arm of chromosome 6 as the only recurrent aberration we speculate that a gene involved in B-cell maturation or survival at this locus may be inactivated as a cause of WM,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[7933, 292, 3389, 1518, 16, 8, 1946, 132, 31, 2645, 765, 20, 3, 1529, 1, 8, 848, 10938, 2, 5325, 1946, 1422, 3, 336, 877, 1, 26, 2645, 16, 1240, 1784, 21, 47, 761, 204, 17, 3, 336, 14176, 1, 1518, 37, 16, 338, 29, 17, 841, 210, 9, 232, 321, 1974, 2, 132, 31, 442, 1193, 3262, 1267, 3, 2593, 4013, 1260, 2474, 5221, 3262, 359, 44, 40, 530, 4, 500, 473, 2, 8, 219, 65, 224, 17, 3, 5221, 2474, 5096, 6601, 3532, 211, 1009, 13796, 7437, 10, 44, 530, 75, 1170, 7014, 3701, 3, 158, 387, 1170, 3698, 204, 10, 1528, 1, 20225, 3, 926, 1, 23149, 1, 24513, 2072, 28, 3, 5221, 2474, 844, 17, 127, 483, 32, 646, 4, 3, 1384, 1, 3, 2645, 447, 3, 885, 241, 1, 8, 2200, 1297, 1, 1518, 2, 3, 694, 5472, 572, 2769, 1, 3, 1946, 37, 192, 16, 322, 17, 8, 226, 145, 5398, 68, 40, 2327, 9, 34, 1384, 1041, 204, 2439, 1, 3, 319, 475, 1, 1170, 49, 22, 3, 158, 387, 7794, 21, 11778, 17, 8, 145, 646, 4, 132, 31, 4537, 15, 25, 28, 26, 2474, 68, 40, 5458, 22, 8, 708, 1, 1518]",1275.0,12720124,320

Cancer Res.,2003-06-01,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins are important regulators of physiological stimuli in lymphocytes. Biological therapies directed at lymphocytic malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) may be mediated by these transcription factors. One such approach, CD154 (CD40-ligand) gene therapy, involves expressing CD154 on malignant B cells from CLL patients by transduction with an adenovirus vector after which the cells are reinfused into the patients. To determine the intracellular signaling pathways that underlie the clinical and immunological responses observed in patients from a Phase I study of CD154 gene therapy, CLL cells from these patients were examined for changes in STAT signaling events. CLL cells from patients who underwent CD154 gene therapy were analyzed for changes in STAT signaling by Western blot analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Activation of STAT1 was correlated with patient response to therapy. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 was detected in the nontransduced CLL cells in 9 of 11 patients 24 h after infusion, but not before. Activation of STAT1 was associated with clinical response, as measured by decreased absolute lymphocyte count, and immunological response, as measured by elevated plasma levels of IFN-gamma. This study indicates that STAT signaling may be an important mediator of biological treatments, such as CD154 gene therapy, and that early STAT1 activation may predict response to this novel treatment.",Journal Article,6078.0,22.0,Signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT proteins are important regulators of physiological stimuli in lymphocytes Biological therapies directed at lymphocytic malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic CLL may be mediated by these transcription factors One such approach CD154 CD40-ligand gene therapy involves expressing CD154 on malignant B cells from CLL patients by transduction with an adenovirus vector after which the cells are reinfused into the patients To determine the intracellular signaling pathways that underlie the clinical and immunological responses observed in patients from a Phase I study of CD154 gene therapy CLL cells from these patients were examined for changes in STAT signaling events CLL cells from patients who underwent CD154 gene therapy were analyzed for changes in STAT signaling by Western blot analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay Activation of STAT1 was correlated with patient response to therapy Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 was detected in the nontransduced CLL cells in 9 of 11 patients 24 h after infusion but not before Activation of STAT1 was associated with clinical response as measured by decreased absolute lymphocyte count and immunological response as measured by elevated plasma levels of IFN-gamma This study indicates that STAT signaling may be an important mediator of biological treatments such as CD154 gene therapy and that early STAT1 activation may predict response to this novel treatment,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[1235, 5182, 2, 3393, 1, 866, 4168, 652, 32, 305, 3196, 1, 4733, 7478, 4, 1594, 1037, 235, 1166, 28, 1193, 441, 225, 22, 442, 1193, 552, 68, 40, 517, 20, 46, 866, 130, 104, 225, 353, 18281, 5040, 1232, 145, 36, 2921, 1046, 18281, 23, 393, 132, 37, 29, 552, 7, 20, 2761, 5, 35, 4488, 3374, 50, 92, 3, 37, 32, 21154, 237, 3, 7, 6, 223, 3, 2087, 314, 460, 17, 5875, 3, 38, 2, 5073, 253, 164, 4, 7, 29, 8, 124, 70, 45, 1, 18281, 145, 36, 552, 37, 29, 46, 7, 11, 409, 9, 400, 4, 4168, 314, 281, 552, 37, 29, 7, 54, 208, 18281, 145, 36, 11, 311, 9, 400, 4, 4168, 314, 20, 1521, 2639, 65, 2, 10980, 5717, 3024, 719, 363, 1, 5793, 10, 438, 5, 69, 51, 6, 36, 564, 982, 1, 5793, 10, 530, 4, 3, 33450, 552, 37, 4, 83, 1, 175, 7, 259, 555, 50, 904, 84, 44, 348, 363, 1, 5793, 10, 41, 5, 38, 51, 22, 644, 20, 340, 1766, 1448, 1276, 2, 5073, 51, 22, 644, 20, 804, 554, 148, 1, 1256, 1705, 26, 45, 2640, 17, 4168, 314, 68, 40, 35, 305, 3810, 1, 1037, 640, 225, 22, 18281, 145, 36, 2, 17, 191, 5793, 363, 68, 678, 51, 6, 26, 229, 24]",1478.0,12796382,504

Transient down-modulation of CD20 by rituximab in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2003-07-31,"Lymphoid cells in most patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), when treated with rituximab, become CD20-. This is thought to be due to masking of CD20 by rituximab. We used specific antimouse immunoglobulin antibodies to detect rituximab on the surface of CLL lymphocytes and we demonstrate that rituximab is rarely detectable after therapy. Only 3 of 65 patients with CLL had rituximab detectable on their lymphocytes after rituximab therapy despite the fact that most had no detectable CD20 expression. In vitro mixing of CLL or Raji cells with rituximab demonstrated that rituximab was detectable on the surface of cells due to its binding to CD20. However, the addition of plasma led to the down-modulation of CD20 expression, and the rituximab became undetectable. This down-modulation of CD20 protein expression was associated with a down-modulation of CD20 mRNA. CLL cells that lost their CD20 expression regained CD20 expression after 24 hours in culture. These data suggest that rituximab therapy leads to a substantial but transient down-modulation of CD20 expression and that negativity for CD20 in cells from patients treated with rituximab is not necessarily due to CD20 masking.

Immunologic monitoring in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Current oncology reports,Curr Oncol Rep,2003-09-01,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by progressive defects in humoral- and cell-mediated immunity. These defects are manifested as a propensity to develop infections with encapsulated bacteria, and less frequently, with gram-negative enterics. In addition, reactivation of viruses such as herpesvirus is not uncommon.

Phase II study of alemtuzumab in chronic lymphoproliferative disorders.,Cancer,Cancer,2003-08-01,"Pilot studies showed that alemtuzumab is active in lymphoproliferative disorders. The authors conducted a Phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alemtuzumab in advanced or refractory chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. Seventy-eight patients were enrolled. The most common diagnoses were chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 42 patients) and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (n = 18 patients). Before entering the study, the patients had received multiple therapies (median, three therapies) and the median time from diagnosis was 7 years. Alemtuzumab was given intravenously at doses of 3 mg, 10 mg, and 30 mg on 3 consecutive days, after which 30 mg was administered 3 times a week. Patients were treated for 4-12 weeks depending on disease response. All patients received prophylactic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and valacyclovir. The overall response rate was 35%, the complete response (CR) rate was 13%, and the partial response (PR) rate was 22%. The median duration of response was 18 months for patients achieving a CR and 7 months for patients achieving a PR. The median duration of survival was 25 months for patients who had a response and 12 months for the entire population. Normalization of the lymphocyte count was observed in 84% of patients and resolution of bone marrow involvement was observed in 49% of patients. The most common infusion-related adverse events were fever, rigors, skin rash, nausea, and dyspnea. These were most common during the first week of therapy.

The initial diagnosis of NK-cell malignancies can be difficult because of the lack of immunophenotypic clonality markers, morphologic heterogeneity, and a poor correlation between cytomorphology and prognosis. Therapeutic recommendations for NK-cell malignancies are derived from retrospective studies or case reports. Immature NK-cell malignancies often have aggressive behavior with poor prognosis, despite administration of acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphocytic leukemia induction chemotherapy. The use of high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue resulted in a prolonged survival in a small series of patients. NK-cell malignancies originating from cells with mature phenotypes form a spectrum of diseases with distinct prognosis. Patients with aggressive NK-cell leukemia invariably die within several months.

Epoetin alfa treatment is optional for patients with cancer-related anemia and hemoglobin levels>10 g/dL and <12 g/dL, depending on clinical circumstances. A prospective, open-label, randomized trial evaluating hematologic response, transfusion use, and QOL after immediate or delayed epoetin alfa treatment in mildly anemic patients (hemoglobin< or =12 g/dL) undergoing chemotherapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma, or lymphoma was recently completed. Study objectives included determining any correlation between changes in hemoglobin level and QOL and assessing any correlation between QOL measures and health care resource use. Interim results suggest that epoetin alfa treatment in patients with hematologic cancers and hemoglobin< or =12 g/dL who are receiving chemotherapy increases hemoglobin, functional capacity, well-being, work and productivity, and health resource use.

Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and signal transduction, as evidenced by phosphorylation of Syk and AKT, were noted. The source of the Hu1D10-induced ROS was examined using the Raji lymphoblastic cell line with engineered defects in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Hu1D10 treatment of clones with deficient mitochondrial respiration produced ROS suggesting a cytoplasmic source. Administration of ROS scavengers to primary CLL cells prior to Hu1D10 treatment diminished AKT activation. Treatment with Hu1D10 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 demonstrated in vitro synergy with enhanced apoptosis. In conjunction with an ongoing clinical trial, blood samples were collected following intravenous infusion of Hu1D10 and analyzed for phosphorylation of AKT. Two of 3 patient samples showed a sustained increase in AKT phosphorylation following Hu1D10 administration.

To assess the effect of fludarabine on the transcription factor STAT1, blood samples obtained on study entry were treated in vitro with fludarabine for 24 h, and the majority of samples displayed an expected decrease in STAT1. To determine whether similar changes occurred in vivo, we developed a flow cytometric assay to quantitate STAT1 levels. On completion of fludarabine cycle 1, CLL cells showed increased STAT1 in the majority of patients, in contrast to the in vitro findings. This may reflect a survival advantage for cells that express high levels of STAT1.

Alemtuzumab as treatment for residual disease after chemotherapy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2003-12-01,"The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of alemtuzumab, the humanized anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody, in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and residual disease after chemotherapy. Forty-one patients received alemtuzumab 3 times weekly for 4 weeks. The first 24 patients received 10 mg per dose, and the next 17 patients received 30 mg. All patients received infection prophylaxis during therapy and for 2 months after treatment. The overall response rate was 46%, including 39% of patients who received the 10 mg dose and responded versus 56% of the patients who received the 30 mg dose. The major reason for failure to respond was the presence of adenopathy. Residual bone marrow disease cleared in most patients, and 11 of 29 patients (38%) achieved a molecular disease remission. The median time to disease progression had not been reached in responders with a median follow-up of 18 months. Six patients remained in disease remission between 24-38 months after therapy. Infusion-related events were common with the initial doses, but all such events were NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 1-2. Infections were reported to occur in 15 patients (37%), and 9 of these infections were reactivation of cytomegalovirus. Three patients developed Epstein-Barr virus positive, large cell lymphoma. Two patients had spontaneous resolution of the lymphoma and, in one patient, the lymphoma resolved after treatment with cidofovir and immunoglobulin. Alemtuzumab produced significant responses in patients with residual disease after chemotherapy. Bone marrow disease was eradicated more frequently than lymph node disease, and molecular disease remissions were achieved. A randomized trial comparing alemtuzumab with observation after chemotherapy is indicated.",Clinical Trial,5895.0,202.0,The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of alemtuzumab the humanized anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic and residual disease after chemotherapy Forty-one patients received alemtuzumab 3 times weekly for 4 weeks The first 24 patients received 10 mg per dose and the next 17 patients received 30 mg. All patients received infection prophylaxis during therapy and for 2 months after treatment The overall response rate was 46 including 39 of patients who received the 10 mg dose and responded versus 56 of the patients who received the 30 mg dose The major reason for failure to respond was the presence of adenopathy Residual marrow disease cleared in most patients and 11 of 29 patients 38 achieved a molecular disease remission The median time to disease progression had not been reached in responders with a median follow-up of 18 months Six patients remained in disease remission between 24-38 months after therapy Infusion-related events were common with the initial doses but all such events were NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 1-2 Infections were reported to occur in 15 patients 37 and 9 of these infections were reactivation of cytomegalovirus Three patients developed Epstein-Barr virus positive large cell Two patients had spontaneous resolution of the and in one patient the resolved after treatment with cidofovir and immunoglobulin Alemtuzumab produced significant responses in patients with residual disease after chemotherapy marrow disease was eradicated more frequently than lymph node disease and molecular disease remissions were achieved A randomized trial comparing alemtuzumab with observation after chemotherapy is indicated,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 461, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 963, 3, 209, 2, 367, 1, 3579, 3, 3619, 312, 7189, 848, 548, 4, 7, 5, 132, 31, 442, 1193, 2, 753, 34, 50, 56, 1213, 104, 7, 103, 3579, 27, 1072, 709, 9, 39, 244, 3, 157, 259, 7, 103, 79, 81, 379, 61, 2, 3, 1305, 269, 7, 103, 201, 81, 62, 7, 103, 930, 2049, 190, 36, 2, 9, 18, 53, 50, 24, 3, 63, 51, 116, 10, 641, 141, 587, 1, 7, 54, 103, 3, 79, 81, 61, 2, 2211, 185, 664, 1, 3, 7, 54, 103, 3, 201, 81, 61, 3, 458, 3852, 9, 496, 6, 1892, 10, 3, 463, 1, 7741, 753, 581, 34, 9266, 4, 96, 7, 2, 175, 1, 462, 7, 519, 513, 8, 219, 34, 734, 3, 52, 98, 6, 34, 91, 42, 44, 85, 1300, 4, 1983, 5, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 203, 53, 437, 7, 958, 4, 34, 734, 59, 259, 519, 53, 50, 36, 904, 139, 281, 11, 186, 5, 3, 388, 415, 84, 62, 225, 281, 11, 2580, 186, 155, 371, 88, 14, 18, 1875, 11, 210, 6, 1271, 4, 167, 7, 567, 2, 83, 1, 46, 1875, 11, 3834, 1, 7314, 169, 7, 276, 5212, 5190, 1450, 109, 375, 31, 100, 7, 42, 3280, 2125, 1, 3, 2, 4, 104, 69, 3, 3862, 50, 24, 5, 26247, 2, 2593, 3579, 1687, 93, 253, 4, 7, 5, 753, 34, 50, 56, 581, 34, 10, 14124, 80, 746, 76, 263, 289, 34, 2, 219, 34, 3166, 11, 513, 8, 384, 160, 1430, 3579, 5, 1664, 50, 56, 16, 1103]",1720.0,14669286,465

Differential expression of histone post-translational modifications in acute myeloid and chronic lymphocytic leukemia determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.,Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry,J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom.,2004-01-01,"The post-translational modification of the core histones is critical to the regulation of chromatin structure. Traditional methods for the determination of histone modification utilize immunoassay techniques to determine the extent and site of post-translational modification. These methods, though sensitive, require site-specific antibodies. This manuscript describes the application of reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to analyze global modification levels of core histones. The method is fast, sensitive, and easily automated. Furthermore, the technique gives the global patterns of modification for all four core histones in a single experiment. The LC-MS method was optimized using histones extracted from bovine thymus. These methods were then applied to the characterization of changes in histone modification in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines treated with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Dose-dependent changes in the distribution of modified core histones were observed. These results were validated in primary leukemia cells from patients with refractory or relapsed AML or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treated on a Phase I clinical trial of the HDAC inhibitor depsipeptide. An increase in the relative abundance of specific acetylated forms of histone H4 was readily observable in these patients at intervals of 4 and 24 h after treatment.",Journal Article,5864.0,,The post-translational modification of the core histones is critical to the regulation of chromatin structure Traditional methods for the determination of histone modification utilize immunoassay techniques to determine the extent and site of post-translational modification These methods though sensitive require site-specific antibodies This manuscript describes the application of reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry LC-MS to analyze global modification levels of core histones The method is fast sensitive and easily automated Furthermore the technique gives the global patterns of modification for all four core histones in a single experiment The LC-MS method was optimized using histones extracted from bovine thymus These methods were then applied to the characterization of changes in histone modification in acute myeloid AML cell lines treated with histone deacetylase HDAC inhibitors Dose-dependent changes in the distribution of modified core histones were observed These results were validated in primary cells from patients with refractory or relapsed AML or chronic lymphocytic CLL treated on a Phase I clinical trial of the HDAC inhibitor depsipeptide An increase in the relative abundance of specific acetylated forms of histone H4 was readily observable in these patients at intervals of 4 and 24 h after treatment,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 539, 2460, 2437, 1, 3, 1793, 8457, 16, 740, 6, 3, 863, 1, 2287, 2772, 1847, 636, 9, 3, 3104, 1, 1508, 2437, 6391, 9006, 1092, 6, 223, 3, 1039, 2, 606, 1, 539, 2460, 2437, 46, 636, 2471, 745, 1353, 606, 112, 890, 26, 5825, 2677, 3, 1581, 1, 1772, 124, 64, 3738, 3165, 5140, 2, 782, 3680, 1837, 2307, 6, 1992, 1648, 2437, 148, 1, 1793, 8457, 3, 596, 16, 5830, 745, 2, 4697, 3235, 798, 3, 1312, 7989, 3, 1648, 764, 1, 2437, 9, 62, 294, 1793, 8457, 4, 8, 226, 8722, 3, 1837, 2307, 596, 10, 4039, 75, 8457, 2484, 29, 14218, 9468, 46, 636, 11, 818, 1498, 6, 3, 2136, 1, 400, 4, 1508, 2437, 4, 286, 533, 329, 31, 285, 73, 5, 1508, 2732, 2654, 222, 61, 470, 400, 4, 3, 1395, 1, 1230, 1793, 8457, 11, 164, 46, 99, 11, 938, 4, 86, 37, 29, 7, 5, 430, 15, 591, 329, 15, 442, 1193, 552, 73, 23, 8, 124, 70, 38, 160, 1, 3, 2654, 230, 10072, 35, 344, 4, 3, 580, 4778, 1, 112, 11941, 2377, 1, 1508, 7812, 10, 3860, 13793, 4, 46, 7, 28, 1582, 1, 39, 2, 259, 555, 50, 24]",1369.0,14698558,170

Patients were eligible to treatment if they were refractory or recurred after a prior response to fludarabine. Seventeen patients were treated. All patients received a preparative regimen of fludarabine (30 mg/m(2) daily for 3 days) and intravenous cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m(2) daily for 3 days). Ten patients received rituximab in addition to chemotherapy. The median time from diagnosis to transplant was 67 months. Nine of 17 patients had refractory disease.

Ten patients with persistent disease underwent immunomanipulation to augment GVL effects including immunosuppression withdrawal and donor lymphocyte infusion with or without rituximab treatment. Seven of these 10 patients had a complete response and 2 had a partial response; 8 of these 9 responders had received rituximab with their immunomanipulation process.

Hematol.,2004-02-01,"We report a unique case of 83-year-old Caucasian male with the initial simultaneous manifestation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and hairy cell leukemia (HCL). The patient presented with absolute lymphocytosis in the blood, asymptomatic generalized lymphadenopathy, and mild splenomegaly. The diagnosis of CLL was suggested from the blood film, but subsequent flow cytometric (FC) analysis on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) revealed two distinct abnormal clones of mature B cells. A small subpopulation (7%) of lymphoid cells expressed CD20, CD11c, FMC-7, CD103, CD25, and kappa surface light chain, consistent with HCL. The larger subpopulation (75%) of lymphoid cells expressed CD19, CD20, CD23, CD5, and lambda light chain, consistent with CLL. The expression of different immunoglobulin light chains on the circulating CLL (lambda) and HCL (kappa) cells suggested two, independent, malignant B-cell clones. Interestingly, FC analysis of bone marrow (BM) cells done 6 months later revealed bright lambda light chain expression on the HCL cells. Despite administration of several different courses of chemotherapy, the HCL subpopulation was not eliminated from the BM but remained stable between 7% and 10% of total BM lymphoid cells.

Rituximab infusion promotes rapid complement depletion and acute CD20 loss in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",J. Immunol.,2004-03-01,"Complement plays an important role in the immunotherapeutic action of the anti-CD20 mAb rituximab, and therefore we investigated whether complement might be the limiting factor in rituximab therapy. Our in vitro studies indicate that at high cell densities, binding of rituximab to human CD20(+) cells leads to loss of complement activity and consumption of component C2. Infusion of rituximab in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients also depletes complement; sera of treated patients have reduced capacity to C3b opsonize and kill CD20(+) cells unless supplemented with normal serum or component C2. Initiation of rituximab infusion in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients leads to rapid clearance of CD20(+) cells. However, substantial numbers of B cells, with significantly reduced levels of CD20, return to the bloodstream immediately after rituximab infusion. In addition, a mAb specific for the Fc region of rituximab does not bind to these recirculating cells, suggesting that the rituximab-opsonized cells were temporarily sequestered by the mononuclear phagocytic system, and then released back into the circulation after the rituximab-CD20 complexes were removed by phagocytic cells.

"VEGF receptor phosphorylation status and apoptosis is modulated by a green tea component, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",Blood,Blood,2004-03-02,"We recently reported that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells synthesize and release vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. CLL B cells also express VEGF membrane receptors (VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2), suggesting that they use VEGF as a survival factor. To assess the mechanism of apoptosis resistance related to VEGF, we determined the impact of VEGF on CLL B cells, and we studied the impact of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a known receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor, on VEGF receptor status and viability of CLL B cells. VEGF165 significantly increased apoptotic resistance of CLL B cells, and immunoblotting revealed that VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 are spontaneously phosphorylated on CLL B cells. EGCG significantly increased apoptosis/cell death in 8 of 10 CLL samples measured by annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining. The increase in annexin V/PI staining was accompanied by caspase-3 activation and poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage at low concentrations of EGCG (3 microg/mL). Moreover, EGCG suppressed the proteins B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 protein (Bcl-2), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) in CLL B cells. Finally, EGCG (3-25 microg/mL) suppressed VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 phosphorylation, albeit incompletely. Thus, these results suggest that VEGF signaling regulates survival signals in CLL cells and that interruption of this autocrine pathway results in caspase activation and subsequent leukemic cell death.",Comparative Study,5803.0,176.0,We recently reported that chronic lymphocytic CLL cells synthesize and release vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF under normoxic and hypoxic conditions CLL B cells also express VEGF membrane receptors VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 suggesting that they use VEGF as a survival factor To assess the mechanism of apoptosis resistance related to VEGF we determined the impact of VEGF on CLL B cells and we studied the impact of epigallocatechin-3-gallate EGCG a known receptor tyrosine kinase RTK inhibitor on VEGF receptor status and viability of CLL B cells VEGF165 significantly increased apoptotic resistance of CLL B cells and immunoblotting revealed that VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 are spontaneously phosphorylated on CLL B cells EGCG significantly increased apoptosis/cell death in 8 of 10 CLL samples measured by annexin V/propidium iodide PI staining The increase in annexin V/PI staining was accompanied by caspase-3 activation and poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase PARP cleavage at low concentrations of EGCG 3 microg/mL Moreover EGCG suppressed the proteins B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 protein Bcl-2 X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein XIAP and myeloid cell leukemia-1 Mcl-1 in CLL B cells Finally EGCG 3-25 microg/mL suppressed VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 phosphorylation albeit incompletely Thus these results suggest that VEGF signaling regulates survival signals in CLL cells and that interruption of this autocrine pathway results in caspase activation and subsequent leukemic cell death,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 761, 210, 17, 442, 1193, 552, 37, 11254, 2, 2008, 756, 845, 129, 161, 618, 669, 15964, 2, 4744, 1298, 552, 132, 37, 120, 1669, 618, 1905, 1186, 618, 3239, 2, 618, 4332, 802, 17, 491, 119, 618, 22, 8, 25, 161, 6, 423, 3, 670, 1, 351, 251, 139, 6, 618, 21, 509, 3, 345, 1, 618, 23, 552, 132, 37, 2, 21, 656, 3, 345, 1, 15613, 27, 15965, 7729, 8, 440, 153, 564, 216, 5261, 230, 23, 618, 153, 156, 2, 2120, 1, 552, 132, 37, 43527, 97, 101, 1631, 251, 1, 552, 132, 37, 2, 5293, 553, 17, 618, 3239, 2, 618, 4332, 32, 6459, 2365, 23, 552, 132, 37, 7729, 97, 101, 351, 31, 273, 4, 66, 1, 79, 552, 347, 644, 20, 4850, 603, 10839, 8456, 2928, 1029, 3, 344, 4, 4850, 603, 2928, 1029, 10, 2756, 20, 1469, 27, 363, 2, 2699, 4938, 8762, 3507, 1451, 2041, 3155, 28, 154, 1003, 1, 7729, 27, 2440, 542, 1393, 7729, 1908, 3, 652, 132, 31, 2647, 4763, 18, 178, 1044, 18, 1006, 1199, 230, 1, 351, 178, 5387, 2, 533, 31, 2647, 14, 1308, 14, 4, 552, 132, 37, 1368, 7729, 27, 243, 2440, 542, 1908, 618, 3239, 2, 618, 4332, 982, 5993, 5252, 631, 46, 99, 309, 17, 618, 314, 2468, 25, 2312, 4, 552, 37, 2, 17, 4823, 1, 26, 5297, 308, 99, 4, 1469, 363, 2, 706, 2015, 31, 273]",1493.0,14996703,760
Expression of the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR7 and disease progression in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/ small lymphocytic lymphoma.,Mayo Clinic proceedings,Mayo Clin. Proc.,2004-03-01,"To assess the clinical relevance of chemokine receptor expression on the progression of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 45 patients with B-CLL were purified and compared with lymph node samples collected from 17 of these patients. Also compared were B cells obtained from peripheral blood samples from 5 healthy controls and B cells from reactive lymph nodes from 3 otherwise healthy persons. The patients were treated at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn, between January 15,1991, and February 7, 2003. Mononuclear cells were stained by a 2-color (fluorescein isothiocyanate/phycoerythrin) flow cytometric assay using antibodies to the chemokine receptors (CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4, CXCR5, CCR2, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, and CCR7) and also to CD19. Of the 45 patients in this study, 20 had Rai stage 0 disease, 12 had stage I disease, 3 had stage II disease, 2 had stage III disease, and 8 had stage IV disease. The mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of the chemokine receptor expression on B-CLL cells was compared with normal controls and was not significantly different, except for an increase in the median expression of CXCR3 (P = .003) and CCR7 (P = .001) on B-CLL cells. We also found a significant increase in the expression of CXCR4 and CCR7 in B-CLL cells from patients with stage IV compared with stage 0 disease (P = .001 and P = .02, respectively).

Current approach to diagnosis and management of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Mayo Clinic proceedings,Mayo Clin. Proc.,2004-03-01,"The care of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has changed dramatically during the past decade. This review summarizes the work-up of lymphocytosis and the current diagnostic criteria and management of CLL. Although clinical staging (Rai and Binet) remains the foundation for determining prognosis, 50% of patients with early-stage disease at diagnosis will experience an aggressive course of disease with early progression and premature death due to CLL. New laboratory techniques (CD38, fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]) can identify some patients with early-stage CLL at high risk of rapid disease progression. The array of treatment options has expanded in recent years and now includes monoclonal antibodies used alone or in combination with purine nucleoside analogues and alkylating agents, which have culminated in dramatically improved response rates. Supportive care guidelines now include vaccination strategies, surveillance for secondary malignancies, and aggressive management of infectious complications.

Epigenetic profiling in chronic lymphocytic leukemia reveals novel methylation targets.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2004-04-01,"CpG island methylation is an epigenetic alteration that contributes to tumorigenesis by transcriptional inactivation of genes. Little is known about the overall levels of CpG island methylation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To provide a baseline estimate of global aberrant methylation and identify target sequences for additional investigation, we performed Restriction Landmark Genomic Scanning on 10 CLL samples. Two methylation-sensitive landmark enzymes were used (NotI and AscI), allowing assessment of over 3000 CpG islands in each sample. Tumor-derived Restriction Landmark Genomic Scanning profiles were compared with profiles from CD19-selected B cells from normal volunteers and matched normal neutrophils from 4 CLL patients. We found 2.5-8.1% (mean 4.8%) of the CpG islands in CLL samples were aberrantly methylated compared with controls, and the methylation events had a nonrandom distribution (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, we identified 193 aberrantly methylated sequences, of which 93% have CpG island characteristics and 90% have homology to genes or expressed sequences. One such gene, the G protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (GRM7), possibly inhibits cyclic AMP signaling in the induction of apoptosis. Bisulfite sequencing of GRM7 confirmed extensive CpG island methylation, and treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) resulted in up-regulated expression of several genes in vitro with concurrent cellular depletion of DNMT1 protein. Our dual-enzyme global methylation study shows that CLL is characterized by widespread nonrandom CpG island methylation similar to other tumors and provides a panel of novel methylation targets that can be used in larger studies designed to assess impact on disease progression and survival.",Journal Article,5773.0,118.0,CpG island methylation is an epigenetic alteration that contributes to tumorigenesis by transcriptional inactivation of genes Little is known about the overall levels of CpG island methylation in chronic lymphocytic CLL To provide a baseline estimate of global aberrant methylation and identify target sequences for additional investigation we performed Restriction Landmark Genomic Scanning on 10 CLL samples Two methylation-sensitive landmark enzymes were used NotI and AscI allowing assessment of over 3000 CpG islands in each sample Tumor-derived Restriction Landmark Genomic Scanning profiles were compared with profiles from CD19-selected B cells from normal volunteers and matched normal neutrophils from 4 CLL patients We found 2.5-8.1 mean 4.8 of the CpG islands in CLL samples were aberrantly methylated compared with controls and the methylation events had a nonrandom distribution P 0.0001 Furthermore we identified 193 aberrantly methylated sequences of which 93 have CpG island characteristics and 90 have homology to genes or expressed sequences One such gene the G protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 GRM7 possibly inhibits cyclic AMP signaling in the induction of apoptosis Bisulfite sequencing of GRM7 confirmed extensive CpG island methylation and treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine decitabine resulted in up-regulated expression of several genes in vitro with concurrent cellular depletion of DNMT1 protein Our dual-enzyme global methylation study shows that CLL is characterized by widespread nonrandom CpG island methylation similar to other tumors and provides a panel of novel methylation targets that can be used in larger studies designed to assess impact on disease progression and survival,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[2075, 3454, 569, 16, 35, 1418, 2611, 17, 2444, 6, 1565, 20, 1431, 2297, 1, 214, 1215, 16, 440, 545, 3, 63, 148, 1, 2075, 3454, 569, 4, 442, 1193, 552, 6, 377, 8, 330, 1191, 1, 1648, 1898, 569, 2, 255, 283, 2866, 9, 402, 940, 21, 173, 4575, 3829, 572, 3702, 23, 79, 552, 347, 100, 569, 745, 3829, 3039, 11, 95, 54094, 2, 54095, 2952, 455, 1, 252, 11264, 2075, 6046, 4, 296, 1000, 30, 526, 4575, 3829, 572, 3702, 1241, 11, 72, 5, 1241, 29, 3158, 715, 132, 37, 29, 295, 5495, 2, 655, 295, 5700, 29, 39, 552, 7, 21, 204, 18, 33, 66, 14, 313, 39, 66, 1, 3, 2075, 6046, 4, 552, 347, 11, 5619, 2963, 72, 5, 535, 2, 3, 569, 281, 42, 8, 12480, 1395, 19, 13, 488, 798, 21, 108, 5744, 5619, 2963, 2866, 1, 92, 966, 47, 2075, 3454, 374, 2, 424, 47, 7984, 6, 214, 15, 570, 2866, 104, 225, 145, 3, 499, 178, 3332, 30577, 8334, 153, 67, 43567, 2150, 1576, 8644, 7793, 314, 4, 3, 504, 1, 351, 6181, 615, 1, 43567, 557, 1344, 2075, 3454, 569, 2, 24, 5, 33, 3924, 6135, 6750, 3004, 627, 4, 126, 1065, 55, 1, 392, 214, 4, 439, 5, 750, 763, 2286, 1, 7328, 178, 114, 1828, 1644, 1648, 569, 45, 1949, 17, 552, 16, 765, 20, 3029, 12480, 2075, 3454, 569, 288, 6, 127, 57, 2, 777, 8, 993, 1, 229, 569, 637, 17, 122, 40, 95, 4, 1077, 94, 1114, 6, 423, 345, 23, 34, 91, 2, 25]",1734.0,15059895,406

Fludarabine and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA) are active in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) both as salvage therapy and in newly diagnosed patients. These agents have revolutionized therapeutic strategies for patients with CLL that had remained unchanged for many years and included alkylating agents-based therapy with no potential for long-term remission or cure. Purine analogues have also been successfully combined with a variety of other chemotherapeutic drugs such as mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, corticosteroids, and monoclonal antibodies, specifically Rituximab and CAMPATH-1H. These agents are immunosuppressive and have been associated with opportunistic infections, the incidence of which can be significantly reduced by early recognition and administration of prophylactic antibiotics.

Management guidelines for use of alemtuzumab in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Clinical lymphoma,Clin Lymphoma,2004-03-01,"An expert opinion roundtable held August 8-9, 2002, brought together clinicians with the most extensive experience with the use of alemtuzumab to pool knowledge and develop treatment goals and guidelines for optimal therapy. By sharing our collective experience, we have been able to formulate recommendations for current clinical practice, which are included in this report, and have emphasized results that have implications for future practice. Guidelines for the management of acute ""first-dose"" events, prophylaxis for infection, detection and treatment of cytomegalovirus reactivation, and hematologic support are presented, with emphasis on allowing patients to proceed smoothly through therapy while maximizing therapeutic benefit. Management of adverse events is facilitated by the predictable timing of their appearance. In general, hematologic adverse events are transient, manageable, and reversible. Clinicians should be cautious of prematurely terminating treatment at 4-6 weeks in patients whose disease responds to treatment. Although resolution of peripheral blood lymphocytosis occurs early in most patients, bone marrow is unlikely to be clear of disease. In particular, grade 4 neutropenia at this time is common and, because it is manageable, it is not an indication to discontinue treatment. The eradication of minimal residual disease from blood and bone marrow observed with alemtuzumab therapy is a major step forward in the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

Cellular immunotherapy for follicular lymphoma using genetically modified CD20-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes.,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,Mol. Ther.,2004-04-01,"Humoral immunotherapy using the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab induces remissions in approximately 60% of patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma; however, most patients eventually relapse despite continued expression of CD20 on lymphoma cells. We have hypothesized that cellular immunotherapy targeting CD20(+) cells might provide a more effective mechanism for eliminating lymphoma cells than anti-CD20 antibodies and are therefore investigating the utility of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) genetically modified to target the CD20 antigen. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were activated with anti-CD3 antibody (OKT3) and recombinant human interleukin-2 and electroporated with a plasmid containing a CD20-specific scFvFc:zeta chimeric T cell receptor gene and a neomycin phosphotransferase gene (neo(R)). Transfected cells were selected using the antibiotic G418 and cloned by limiting dilution. Using this approach, we have generated CD8(+) CTL clones with CD20-specific cytotoxicity, which specifically lysed CD20(+) target cells, including actual tumor cells from patients with follicular lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma, splenic marginal zone lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The CTL clones have been expanded to numbers sufficient for therapy ( approximately 10(9) cells). Our data indicate the feasibility of generating and expanding CD20-specific CTL and, for the first time, demonstrate that such CTL exhibit specific cytotoxicity against actual tumor cells isolated from patients with a variety of B lymphoid malignancies.

The role of craniospinal irradiation in adults with a central nervous system recurrence of leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2004-05-01,"Although central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis in patients with leukemia has reduced the incidence of CNS disease recurrence, it still is reported to occur in approximately 5-10% of cases, resulting in a median survival of 6 months. Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) has been shown to improve survival in children who develop a CNS recurrence of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). However, to the authors' knowledge, the role of CSI in adults with a CNS recurrence of leukemia is unknown. A retrospective review of adult patients treated with CSI for a CNS recurrence of leukemia identified 16 patients treated between 1986 and 2001. The median age of the patients was 34 years (range, 16-58 years). The diagnoses included seven patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), eight patients with ALL, and one patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis. All patients had achieved a complete disease remission prior to the CNS recurrence. Eleven patients had an isolated CNS recurrence and 5 patients had concurrent disease identified in the blood/bone marrow. The median dose of radiation was 24 grays (Gy) (range, 18-34.5 Gy) to the cranium and 18 Gy (range, 15-30 Gy) to the spine. The median fraction size was 1.8 Gy (range, 1.5-2.0 Gy) to the cranium and 1.5 Gy (range, 1.5-2.0 Gy) to the spine. Fifteen patients were also treated with intrathecal chemotherapy. One patient failed to complete radiation treatment because of disease progression. Thirteen patients achieved a complete response in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The median time to disease progression was 3 months from the first day of CSI and 7 months from CNS recurrence. The median survival was 4 months and 9 months, respectively. No CNS recurrences occurred, but there were 11 bone marrow failures, 2 patients without recurrence at > 5 years, and 3 deaths without a documented site of failure. Thirteen patients had no evidence of disease in the CSF until their death or the time of last follow-up. CSI with or without intrathecal chemotherapy appears to be effective at eliminating leukemia in the craniospinal axis. However, the eradication of disease in the CNS was not found to be effective at preventing disease recurrence in the bone marrow, and despite improved control of disease in the CNS, adult patients with a CNS recurrence still had a poor prognosis.

The aim of the current analysis was to evaluate retrospectively the efficacy and safety of (90)Y ibritumomab tiuxetan in patients with Richter syndrome (RS). Patients with histologically proven CD20-positive RS and < 25% lymphoma and/or chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the bone marrow were treated. Patients received an imaging dose of (111)In-labeled ibritumomab tiuxetan of 1.6 mg (5.0 mCi of (111)In) intravenously. One week later, they received 0.3 or 0.4 mCi/kg of (90)Y ibritumomab tiuxetan. Rituximab, at a dose of 250 mg/m(2) intravenously, was given immediately before ibritumomab tiuxetan on Days 1 and 8. Seven patients were treated. Their median age was 56 years (range, 44-70 years). The median time to transformation was 7.9 years (range, 0.7-28.4 years). The median number of previous therapies received was five (range, one to seven previous therapies). The median number of previous therapies received for RS was one (range, none to three previous therapies).

Eighty-eight patients were treated with fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) intravenously daily for 3 days and mitoxantrone 10 mg/m(2) on Day 1 (FN). Patients were divided into four groups based on expected response to single-agent fludarabine. These four groups included previously untreated patients, patients who previously were treated with alkylating agents, patients who were successfully treated with alkylating agents and fludarabine but who developed recurrent disease, and patients whose disease was refractory to fludarabine with or without alkylating agents. The overall response rate was 66%. The response rates were 83% in previously untreated patients, 87% in patients previously treated with alkylating agents, 50% in patients whose disease was not refractory to fludarabine at the start of therapy, and 25% in patients whose disease was refractory to fludarabine. The complete remission (CR) rate was 20% for previously untreated patients, which was not significantly different from the CR rate for a group of historical control patients who were treated with single-agent fludarabine. The median follow-up was 8 years for surviving patients. The median progression free survival was 24 months for all patients and 34 months for previously untreated patients. The median overall survival was 40 months, and the median survival of previously untreated patients was 88 months. The most common toxicities were myelosuppression and infection.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells of more than 1% of patients express virtually identical immunoglobulins.,Blood,Blood,2004-06-24,"We examined the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain variable region genes (V(H) genes) used by leukemia cells of 1220 unrelated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We found 1188 (97%) expressed Ig encoded by a single Ig V(H) subgroup, the most common of which was V(H)3 (571 or 48.1%), followed by V(H)1 (319 or 26.8%) and V(H)4 (241 or 20.2%). Using allele-specific primers, we found 13.8% of all samples (n = 164) used one major V(H)1-69 allele, designated 51p1, 163 of which were not somatically mutated. For these cases, there was marked restriction in the structure of the Ig third complementarity determining regions (CDR3s), which were encoded by a small number of unmutated D and J(H) gene segments. Strikingly, 15 of the 163 cases had virtually identical CDR3s encoded by the second reading frame of D3-16 and J(H)3. Further analysis revealed that each of these 15 samples used the same unmutated Ig kappa light-chain gene, namely A27.

The recent introduction of the monoclonal antibodies rituximab and alemtuzumab into clinical trials for patients with CLL has generated promising results. Rituximab targets the CD20 antigen and demonstrates varied single-agent activity that is highly dependent upon the dosing schedule and treatment status of the patient. More importantly, when rituximab is combined with fludarabine or fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, a high frequency of CR and prolonged progression-free survival are observed without an appreciable increase in significant toxicity. Alemtuzumab targets the more ubiquitously expressed CD52 antigen and is therefore associated with a higher frequency of toxicity, particularly immunosuppression, but has appreciable activity in fludarabine refractory CLL.

ZAP-70 compared with immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene mutation status as a predictor of disease progression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2004-08-01,"The course of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is variable. In aggressive disease, the CLL cells usually express an unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region gene (IgV(H)) and the 70-kD zeta-associated protein (ZAP-70), whereas in indolent disease, the CLL cells usually express mutated IgV(H) but lack expression of ZAP-70. We evaluated the CLL B cells from 307 patients with CLL for ZAP-70 and mutations in the rearranged IgV(H) gene. We then investigated the association between the results and the time from diagnosis to initial therapy. We found that ZAP-70 was expressed above a defined threshold level in 117 of the 164 patients with an unmutated IgV(H) gene (71 percent), but in only 24 of the 143 patients with a mutated IgV(H) gene (17 percent, P<0.001). Among the patients with ZAP-70-positive CLL cells, the median time from diagnosis to initial therapy in those who had an unmutated IgV(H) gene (2.8 years) was not significantly different from the median time in those who had a mutated IgV(H) gene (4.2 years, P=0.07). However, the median time from diagnosis to initial treatment in each of these groups was significantly shorter than the time in patients with ZAP-70-negative CLL cells who had either mutated or unmutated IgV(H) genes (P<0.001). The median time from diagnosis to initial therapy among patients who did not have ZAP-70 was 11.0 years in those with a mutated IgV(H) gene and 7.1 years in those with an unmutated IgV(H) gene (P<0.001).

Free circulating soluble CD52 as a tumor marker in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and its implication in therapy with anti-CD52 antibodies.,Cancer,Cancer,2004-09-01,"The CD52 antigen is a glycoprotein anchored on the cell membrane of mature B and T lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils. Alemtuzumab (CAMPATH-1H; anti-CD52) is currently approved for the treatment of patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The authors investigated the possibility that CD52 may be shed from cells and, once soluble, may bind to injected alemtuzumab, forming immune complexes. The authors used Western blot analysis, immunoprecipitation, and enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay to investigate the presence of soluble CD52 (sCD52) in the plasma specimens of 117 patients with CLL. They also used in vitro mixing experiments to examine the ability of sCD52 to compete with cells and sequester therapeutic alemtuzumab. The authors detected high levels of sCD52 in the plasma specimens of patients with CLL. sCD52 can compete with cells in vitro for binding to alemtuzumab, and can form complexes in patients receiving alemtuzumab. Plasma levels of sCD52 were found to be correlated (r)with Rai stage (P = 0.0001), beta-2-microglobulin (beta-2M) levels (P = 0.00002), soluble CD23 levels (r = 0.42, P < 0.001), and immunoglobulin mutation status (P = 0.003).

"Use of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in Mumbai, India: a review of 200 consecutive cases by a panel of five expert hematopathologists.",Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2004-08-01,"This study aims to answer the question whether the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) can be practised to international standards at the Lymphoma Registry (LR) established at the Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India. Furthermore, the study aims to identify differences in the distribution of NHL subtypes at this LR (likely to be representative of India) as compared to the rest of the world. A panel of 5 expert hematopathologists from the NHL Classification Project reviewed 200 consecutive NHL cases at the LR in January of 2001. These cases were accrued during August and September, 2000. On all cases, hematoxylin and eosin stains and appropriate immunostains were available for review. The diagnosis made by the host pathologist at the LR (KNN) and the initial diagnosis made by each of the expert hematopathologists was compared with the consensus diagnosis. A consensus diagnosis was made by the 5 experts in 197 cases. The agreement of the host pathologist with the consensus diagnosis was 82% and the agreement of the individual experts with the consensus diagnosis varied from 76-88% (mean 82%). According to the consensus diagnosis, 80% of NHLs were of B-cell type, 18% were of T-cell type, and the immunophenotype could not be determined in the remaining 2% of cases. In conclusion, the WHO classification of NHL was properly utilized at the Lymphoma Registry, Mumbai, India, and geographic differences were noted in the distribution of NHL subtypes at the LR as compared to the rest of the world. Precursor T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma was more common in India (7%) than the rest of the world (1-4%), and indolent B-cell NHLs (29%) were less common than in the West. As compared to China and Japan, peripheral T-cell lymphoma (4.6%), extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, nasal type (0.5%) and extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT-lymphoma) (2.6%) were less common, but follicular lymphoma (15%) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (5%) were more common. This suggests that the distribution of the B-cell and T-cell lymphomas in the Indian population, except for lymphoblastic lymphoma, lies in between the Western world (mainly Caucasian) and the Orientals.",Journal Article,5651.0,38.0,This study aims to answer the question whether the World Health Organization WHO classification of 's NHL can be practised to international standards at the Registry LR established at the Tata Memorial Hospital Mumbai India Furthermore the study aims to identify differences in the distribution of NHL subtypes at this LR likely to be representative of India as compared to the rest of the world A panel of 5 expert hematopathologists from the NHL Classification Project reviewed 200 consecutive NHL cases at the LR in January of 2001 These cases were accrued during August and September 2000 On all cases hematoxylin and eosin stains and appropriate immunostains were available for review The diagnosis made by the host pathologist at the LR KNN and the initial diagnosis made by each of the expert hematopathologists was compared with the consensus diagnosis A consensus diagnosis was made by the 5 experts in 197 cases The agreement of the host pathologist with the consensus diagnosis was 82 and the agreement of the individual experts with the consensus diagnosis varied from 76-88 mean 82 According to the consensus diagnosis 80 of NHLs were of B-cell type 18 were of T-cell type and the immunophenotype could not be determined in the remaining 2 of cases In conclusion the WHO classification of NHL was properly utilized at the Registry Mumbai India and geographic differences were noted in the distribution of NHL subtypes at the LR as compared to the rest of the world Precursor T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma was more common in India 7 than the rest of the world 1-4 and indolent B-cell NHLs 29 were less common than in the West As compared to China and Japan peripheral T-cell 4.6 extranodal NK/T cell nasal type 0.5 and extranodal marginal zone B-cell of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue MALT-lymphoma 2.6 were less common but follicular 15 and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic 5 were more common This suggests that the distribution of the B-cell and T-cell lymphomas in the Indian population except for lymphoblastic lies in between the Western world mainly Caucasian and the Orientals,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[26, 45, 2970, 6, 6634, 3, 2840, 317, 3, 1956, 341, 2533, 54, 947, 1, 292, 1176, 122, 40, 54361, 6, 944, 3371, 28, 3, 1608, 2030, 635, 28, 3, 23096, 2563, 702, 33733, 7776, 798, 3, 45, 2970, 6, 255, 362, 4, 3, 1395, 1, 1176, 814, 28, 26, 2030, 322, 6, 40, 3724, 1, 7776, 22, 72, 6, 3, 3677, 1, 3, 1956, 8, 993, 1, 33, 2005, 18169, 29, 3, 1176, 947, 3105, 446, 1250, 935, 1176, 140, 28, 3, 2030, 4, 1024, 1, 1758, 46, 140, 11, 3198, 190, 2480, 2, 2636, 1081, 23, 62, 140, 6209, 2, 5975, 7742, 2, 870, 14889, 11, 390, 9, 206, 3, 147, 1229, 20, 3, 1204, 5093, 28, 3, 2030, 43718, 2, 3, 388, 147, 1229, 20, 296, 1, 3, 2005, 18169, 10, 72, 5, 3, 1391, 147, 8, 1391, 147, 10, 1229, 20, 3, 33, 3186, 4, 6114, 140, 3, 2024, 1, 3, 1204, 5093, 5, 3, 1391, 147, 10, 878, 2, 3, 2024, 1, 3, 797, 3186, 5, 3, 1391, 147, 2051, 29, 846, 889, 313, 878, 768, 6, 3, 1391, 147, 493, 1, 11440, 11, 1, 132, 31, 267, 203, 11, 1, 102, 31, 267, 2, 3, 5496, 359, 44, 40, 509, 4, 3, 1844, 18, 1, 140, 4, 1221, 3, 54, 947, 1, 1176, 10, 6785, 2080, 28, 3, 1608, 33733, 7776, 2, 3466, 362, 11, 1051, 4, 3, 1395, 1, 1176, 814, 28, 3, 2030, 22, 72, 6, 3, 3677, 1, 3, 1956, 2765, 102, 1275, 2647, 4763, 10, 80, 186, 4, 7776, 67, 76, 3, 3677, 1, 3, 1956, 14, 39, 2, 2316, 132, 31, 11440, 462, 11, 299, 186, 76, 4, 3, 7261, 22, 72, 6, 5055, 2, 6157, 672, 102, 31, 39, 49, 4093, 1765, 102, 31, 6743, 267, 13, 33, 2, 4093, 3450, 3614, 132, 31, 1, 2713, 41, 2303, 246, 8273, 4763, 18, 49, 11, 299, 186, 84, 1974, 167, 2, 442, 1193, 2647, 302, 1193, 33, 11, 80, 186, 26, 844, 17, 3, 1395, 1, 3, 132, 31, 2, 102, 31, 1557, 4, 3, 7968, 266, 2187, 9, 1275, 9247, 4, 59, 3, 1521, 1956, 2615, 3229, 2, 3, 54362]",2116.0,15370208,790
Adaphostin-induced apoptosis in CLL B cells is associated with induction of oxidative stress and exhibits synergy with fludarabine.,Blood,Blood,2004-09-23,"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by accumulation of clonal lymphocytes resistant to apoptosis. We evaluated the ability of the investigational antileukemic agent adaphostin to induce apoptosis in CLL B cells and synergize with fludarabine in vitro. Analysis by annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining revealed that the concentration of adaphostin required to induce 50% cell death (IC50) at 24 hours was 4.2 microM (range, 1.10-11.25 microM; median, 4.25 microM; n=29) for CLL isolates and more than 10 microM for B and T cells from healthy donors. Immunoblots demonstrated adaphostin induced poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and cleavage of caspase-3 substrates, suggesting that adaphostin induces apoptosis. Adaphostin increased the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within CLL B cells, and the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine blocked both adaphostin-induced ROS generation and apoptosis. Adaphostin also caused a decrease in the level of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. When adaphostin was combined with fludarabine (F-ARA-AMP), a synergistic effect on cell death was observed in all 10 CLL samples. These findings not only indicate that adaphostin induces apoptosis selectively in CLL B cells through a mechanism that involves ROS generation but also demonstrate its ability to augment the effects of fludarabine.

"A novel celecoxib derivative, OSU03012, induces cytotoxicity in primary CLL cells and transformed B-cell lymphoma cell line via a caspase- and Bcl-2-independent mechanism.",Blood,Blood,2004-09-28,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an incurable adult leukemia characterized by disrupted apoptosis. OSU03012 is a bioavailable third-generation celecoxib derivative devoid of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitory activity that potently induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines and is being developed as an anticancer therapy in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Rapid Access to Intervention Development (RAID) program. We assessed the ability of OSU03012 to induce apoptosis in primary CLL cells and the mechanism by which this occurs. The LC50 (lethal concentration 50%) of OSU03012 at 24 hours was 7.1 microM, and this decreased to 5.5 microM at 72 hours. Additionally, we have demonstrated that OSU03012 mediates apoptosis by activation of the intrinsic, mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis but also activates alternative cell death pathways that are caspase independent.

We initiated a minimum effective pharmacologic dose study of depsipeptide, targeting an in vivo dose at which acetylation of histone proteins H3 and H4 increased by 100% or more in vitro. Ten patients with CLL and 10 patients with AML were treated with 13 mg/m(2) depsipeptide intravenously days 1, 8, and 15 of therapy. Neither life-threatening toxicities nor cardiac toxicities were noted, although the majority of patients experienced progressive fatigue, nausea, and other constitutional symptoms that prevented repeated dosing. Several patients had evidence of antitumor activity following treatment, but no partial or complete responses were noted by National Cancer Institute criteria. HDAC inhibition and histone acetylation increases of at least 100% were noted, as well as increases in p21 promoter H4 acetylation, p21 protein, and 1D10 antigen expression. We conclude that depsipeptide effectively inhibits HDAC in vivo in patients with CLL and AML, but its use in the current schedule of administration is limited by progressive constitutional symptoms.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation among patients with leukemia of all ages in Texas.,Cancer,Cancer,2004-11-01,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an effective but expensive medical procedure to which some ethnic minorities, the elderly, and those without insurance have been shown to have limited access. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether socioeconomic factors were associated with HSCT usage rates in patients with leukemia. The authors identified 6574 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or other leukemias from the 1999 Texas Hospital Inpatient Discharge Public Use Data File. Of these patients, 1604 received an autologous or allogeneic HSCT. The authors assessed patients' ethnicity, payer status, age, gender, and comorbid medical conditions. Logistic regression was used to control for patient characteristics and to evaluate associations among payer status, ethnicity, and HSCT use. P < or = 0.05 indicated statistical significance. Patients who self-paid had the highest rate of HSCT use in all age groups (32%; P < or = 0.01) and in the adult group (36%; P = 0.11). Elderly patients with Medicare had a low rate of HSCT use (17%; P = 0.13). Logistic regression showed no statistically significant associations between payer status or ethnicity and HSCT use. However, elderly women were significantly less likely to undergo HSCT than elderly men (odds ratio, 0.34; P < or = 0.01).

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and retinoid X receptor ligands are potent inducers of differentiation and apoptosis in leukemias.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2004-10-01,"The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) is a member of the nuclear receptor family that forms heterodimers with retinoid X receptor. These heterodimers bind to DNA and activate the transcription of target genes. Here, we report that the PPAR gamma receptor protein is expressed in primary myeloid and lymphoid leukemias and in lymphoma and myeloma cell lines. In this study, we compared the activity of several PPAR gamma ligands including BRL49653 (rosiglitazone), 15-deoxy-Delta 12,14-prostaglandin J(2), and the novel triterpenoid 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid on leukemia cells. Exposure to these PPAR gamma ligands induced apoptosis in myeloid (U937 and HL-60) and lymphoid (Su-DHL, Sup-M2, Ramos, Raji, Hodgkin's cell lines, and primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia) cells. A similar exposure to these PPAR gamma ligands induced the differentiation of myeloid leukemic cells. A combination of PPAR gamma ligands with a retinoid X receptor agonist (i.e., LG100268) or a retinoic acid receptor agonist (i.e., all trans-retinoic acid) enhanced differentiating and growth-inhibitory effects. 2-Cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid induced differentiation and apoptosis with much greater potency than the other PPAR gamma ligands in established cell lines and primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples. Exposure to 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid induced mitochondrial depolarization and caspase activation, which was associated with apoptosis induction. In Bcl-2-overexpressing chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, the small-molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor HA14-1 sensitized these cells to 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid-induced apoptosis.

A pilot trial of rituximab and alemtuzumab combination therapy in patients with relapsed and/or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2004-11-01,"The treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who fail purine analogues is sub optimal. CLL lymphocytes express two antigens, namely CD 20 and CD 52, for which monoclonal antibodies are readily available. Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeted against CD 20, which has some activity in refractory CLL, with primary effect on nodal disease. Alemtuzumab is a humanized anti-CD 52 antibody that is approved for the treatment of CLL in patients who fail alkylating agents and purine analogues. Alemtuzumab has better activity in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow compared to nodal disease. We investigated whether combining both antibodies is safe in refractory CLL. Both antibodies were given to a total of 12 patients divided into 3 cohorts with escalating alemtuzumab doses (3 mg, 10 mg, and 30 mg). The combination was proven to be safe, not toxic, feasible, and active. One patient attained PR by NCI criteria while all other patients had stable disease lasting a median of 101.5 days.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,2004-01-01,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is one of the most commonly diagnosed leukemias managed by practicing hematologists. For many years patients with CLL have been viewed as similar, with a long natural history and only marginally effective therapies that rarely yielded complete responses. Recently, several important observations related to the biologic significance of V(H) mutational status and associated ZAP-70 overexpression, disrupted p53 function, and chromosomal aberrations have led to the ability to identify patients at high risk for early disease progression and inferior survival. Concurrent with these investigations, several treatments including the nucleoside analogues, monoclonal antibodies rituximab and alemtuzumab have been introduced. Combination of these therapies in clinical trials has led to high complete and overall response rates when applied as initial therapy for symptomatic CLL. Thus, the complexity of initial risk stratification of CLL and treatment has increased significantly. Furthermore, when these initial therapies do not work, approach of the CLL patient with fludarabine-refractory disease can be quite challenging. This session will describe the natural history of a CLL patient with emphasis on important decision junctures at different time points in the disease. In Section I, Dr. Stephan Stilgenbauer focuses on the discussion that occurs with CLL patients at their initial evaluation. This includes a review of the diagnostic criteria for CLL and prognostic factors utilized to predict the natural history of the disease. The later discussion of risk stratification focuses on molecular and genomic aberrations that predict rapid progression, poor response to therapy, and inferior survival. Ongoing and future efforts examining early intervention strategies in high risk CLL are reviewed. In Section II, Drs. Ian Flinn and Jesus G. Berdeja focus on the discussion of CLL patients when symptomatic disease has developed. This includes an updated review of monotherapy trials with nucleoside analogs and recent trials that have combined these with monoclonal antibodies and/or alternative chemotherapy agents. Appropriate application of more aggressive therapies such as autologous and allogeneic immunotherapy and less aggressive treatments for appropriate CLL patient candidates are discussed. In Section III, Dr. John Byrd focuses on the discussion that occurs with CLL patients whose disease is refractory to fludarabine. The application of genetic risk stratification in choosing therapy for this subset of patients is reviewed. Available data with conventional combination based therapies and monoclonal antibodies are discussed. Finally, alternative promising investigational therapies including new antibodies, kinase inhibitors (CDK, PDK1/AKT, PKC) and alternative targeted therapies (DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, etc.) are reviewed with an emphasis on the most promising agents for this patient population.",Journal Article,5864.0,140.0,Chronic lymphocytic CLL is one of the most commonly diagnosed leukemias managed by practicing hematologists For many years patients with CLL have been viewed as similar with a long natural history and only marginally effective therapies that rarely yielded complete responses Recently several important observations related to the biologic significance of V H mutational status and associated ZAP-70 overexpression disrupted p53 function and chromosomal aberrations have led to the ability to identify patients at high risk for early disease progression and inferior survival Concurrent with these investigations several treatments including the nucleoside analogues monoclonal antibodies rituximab and alemtuzumab have been introduced Combination of these therapies in clinical trials has led to high complete and overall response rates when applied as initial therapy for symptomatic CLL Thus the complexity of initial risk stratification of CLL and treatment has increased significantly Furthermore when these initial therapies do not work approach of the CLL patient with fludarabine-refractory disease can be quite challenging This session will describe the natural history of a CLL patient with emphasis on important decision junctures at different time points in the disease In Section I Dr. Stephan Stilgenbauer focuses on the discussion that occurs with CLL patients at their initial evaluation This includes a review of the diagnostic criteria for CLL and prognostic factors utilized to predict the natural history of the disease The later discussion of risk stratification focuses on molecular and genomic aberrations that predict rapid progression poor response to therapy and inferior survival Ongoing and future efforts examining early intervention strategies in high risk CLL are reviewed In Section II Drs Ian Flinn and Jesus G.

Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX) determined the incidence of Richter syndrome (RS) in patients with CLL between 1992 and 2002. RS occurs in approximately 5% of patients with CLL. The large cells of RS may arise through transformation of the original CLL clone or represent a new neoplasm. RS may be triggered by viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus. Trisomy 12 and chromosome 11 abnormalities are more frequent in patients with RS than in the overall population of patients with CLL. Multiple genetic defects, such as mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, p16INK4A, and p21, loss of p27 expression, deletion of retinoblastoma, increased copy number of C-MYC, and decreased expression of the A-MYB gene, have been described. These abnormalities may cause CLL cells to proliferate and-by facilitating the acquisition of new genetic abnormalities-to transform into RS cells. Therapeutic strategies include intensive chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies, and stem cell transplantation. The response rates range from 5% to 43% (complete response, 5-38%), and the median survival duration ranges from 5 months to 8 months.

"Aberrant morphology, proliferation, and apoptosis of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.","Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",Hematology,2004-08-01,"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has been traditionally described as a disease characterized by an accumulation of quiescent small lymphocytes with decreased susceptibility to apoptotic cell death. However, small numbers of ""atypical"" lymphocytes and prolymphocytes (PL) are frequently observed in the bone marrow (BM) of patients with CLL. In this study, we examined BM biopsy and aspirate specimens obtained from seven patients with atypical CLL. Using a double labeling (Ki-67+/CD20+) immunohistochemical method, we found that an appreciable number of the atypical CLL cells expressed the proliferation-associated protein Ki-67. Because CLL is characterized by a slow change in the peripheral blood (PB) lymphocyte count, we reasoned that a subpopulation of CLL cells probably undergoes spontaneous apoptosis. Using Western blot analysis, we observed expression of procaspase-9, procaspase-10, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase by the neoplastic cells in all seven cases of CLL, and procaspase-3 and procaspase-8 expression in six neoplasms. We also detected cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in four and five CLL cases, respectively.

Cell death of bioenergetically compromised and transcriptionally challenged CLL lymphocytes by chlorinated ATP.,Blood,Blood,2005-02-17,"Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) acts as a key survival factor for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. In addition, dissipation of cellular bioenergy may impose a lethal effect on these quiescent cells. Previously, in multiple myeloma cell lines we demonstrated that halogenated adenosine (8-Cl-Ado) was phosphorylated to triphosphate (8-Cl-adenosine triphosphate [ATP]), which preferentially incorporated into mRNA and inhibited RNA synthesis by premature transcription termination. Furthermore, 8-Cl-ATP accumulation was associated with a decline in cellular bioenergy. Based on these actions, we hypothesized that 8-Cl-Ado would be ideal to target CLL lymphocytes. In the present study we demonstrate that leukemic lymphocytes incubated with 8-Cl-Ado display time- and dose-dependent increase in the accumulation of 8-Cl-ATP, with a parallel depletion of the endogenous ATP pool. Inhibition of global RNA synthesis resulted in a significant decline in the expression of transcripts with a short half-life such as MCL1. Consistent to this, protein expression of MCL-1 but not B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) was decreased. Furthermore, 8-Cl-ATP induced programmed cell death, as suggested by caspases activation, cleavage of caspase 3, and PARP (poly-adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose polymerase), and increased DNA fragmentation. In conclusion, 8-Cl-Ado induces apoptosis in CLL lymphocytes by targeting cellular bioenergy as well as RNA transcription and translation of key survival genes such as MCL1.",Journal Article,5451.0,31.0,Myeloid cell leukemia-1 MCL-1 acts as a key survival factor for chronic lymphocytic CLL cells In addition dissipation of cellular bioenergy may impose a lethal effect on these quiescent cells Previously in multiple cell lines we demonstrated that halogenated adenosine 8-Cl-Ado was phosphorylated to triphosphate 8-Cl-adenosine triphosphate ATP which preferentially incorporated into mRNA and inhibited RNA synthesis by premature transcription termination Furthermore 8-Cl-ATP accumulation was associated with a decline in cellular bioenergy Based on these actions we hypothesized that 8-Cl-Ado would be ideal to target CLL lymphocytes In the present study we demonstrate that leukemic lymphocytes incubated with 8-Cl-Ado display time- and dose-dependent increase in the accumulation of 8-Cl-ATP with a parallel depletion of the endogenous ATP pool Inhibition of global RNA synthesis resulted in a significant decline in the expression of transcripts with a short half-life such as MCL1 Consistent to this protein expression of MCL-1 but not B-cell lymphoma-2 BCL-2 was decreased Furthermore 8-Cl-ATP induced programmed cell death as suggested by caspases activation cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP poly-adenosine diphosphate ADP -ribose polymerase and increased DNA fragmentation In conclusion 8-Cl-Ado induces apoptosis in CLL lymphocytes by targeting cellular bioenergy as well as RNA transcription and translation of key survival genes such as MCL1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[533, 31, 2647, 14, 1308, 14, 4459, 22, 8, 825, 25, 161, 9, 442, 1193, 552, 37, 4, 352, 30734, 1, 763, 28358, 68, 15099, 8, 2266, 254, 23, 46, 6735, 37, 373, 4, 232, 31, 285, 21, 264, 17, 37855, 4938, 66, 5192, 8614, 10, 2365, 6, 7345, 66, 5192, 4938, 7345, 3918, 92, 3509, 2449, 237, 956, 2, 879, 893, 2525, 20, 5682, 866, 7202, 798, 66, 5192, 3918, 1835, 10, 41, 5, 8, 1858, 4, 763, 28358, 90, 23, 46, 5592, 21, 1237, 17, 66, 5192, 8614, 688, 40, 3662, 6, 283, 552, 1594, 4, 3, 364, 45, 21, 608, 17, 2015, 1594, 8303, 5, 66, 5192, 8614, 3640, 98, 2, 61, 470, 344, 4, 3, 1835, 1, 66, 5192, 3918, 5, 8, 2755, 2286, 1, 3, 2682, 3918, 6545, 297, 1, 1648, 893, 2525, 627, 4, 8, 93, 1858, 4, 3, 55, 1, 2680, 5, 8, 978, 1303, 358, 225, 22, 8132, 925, 6, 26, 178, 55, 1, 1308, 14, 84, 44, 132, 31, 4763, 18, 1044, 18, 10, 340, 798, 66, 5192, 3918, 277, 1846, 31, 273, 22, 1148, 20, 7629, 363, 3155, 1, 1469, 27, 2, 2041, 2699, 4938, 8762, 3638, 3507, 1451, 2, 101, 261, 7678, 4, 1221, 66, 5192, 8614, 1516, 351, 4, 552, 1594, 20, 529, 763, 28358, 22, 149, 22, 893, 866, 2, 2691, 1, 825, 25, 214, 225, 22, 8132]",1451.0,15718423,29

The purpose of this study was to improve the complete remission (CR) rate for previously treated patients and evaluate the quality of bone marrow response. One hundred seventy-seven previously treated patients with CLL were evaluated. Treatment consisted of rituximab 375 mg/m(2) day 1 of course 1 and 500 mg/m(2) day 1 of courses 2 to 6; fludarabine 25 mg/m(2)/d days 2 to 4 of course 1 and days 1 to 3 of courses 2 to 6; and cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m(2)/d days 2 to 4 of course 1 and days 1 to 3 of courses 2 to 6. Courses were repeated every 4 weeks. CR was achieved in 25% of 177 patients, and nodular partial remission and partial remission were achieved in 16% and 32% of patients, respectively; the overall response rate was 73%. Twelve (32%) of 37 complete responders tested achieved molecular remission in bone marrow. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify pretreatment patient characteristics associated with CR and overall remission, longer time to progression, and overall survival. The FCR regimen was an active and well-tolerated treatment for previously treated patients with CLL. Myelosuppression was the most common toxicity. FCR induced the highest CR rate reported in a clinical trial of previously treated patients with CLL.

The 213 patients were monitored for 1567 person-years (median, 6.3 years), during which 71% died. During follow-up, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 17), Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (n = 6), primary amyloidosis (n = 3), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 3) developed in 29 patients (14%). The number of patients with progression to lymphoid neoplasms was 15.9 times that expected in the general population. The cumulative probabilities of progression to one of these disorders were 10% at 5 years, 18% at 10 years, and 24% at 15 years. The overall average risks for progression were approximately 1.5% per year. Rates of death resulting from other diseases (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, etc.) were 31% at 5 years, 52% at 10 years, and 65% at 15 years.

TWIST2 demonstrates differential methylation in immunoglobulin variable heavy chain mutated and unmutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2005-04-04,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a clinically heterogeneous disease for which natural history can be predicted based on the presence or absence of immunoglobulin (Ig) variable heavy chain (V(H)) gene mutations. Herein we report selective epigenetic silencing of the transcription factor TWIST2 (DERMO1) in Ig V(H) mutated CLL and describe a semiquantitative assay to study promoter methylation of this gene in primary tumor cells. TWIST2 promoter methylation was identified by restriction landmark genome scanning. Southern blot (SB), bisulfite sequencing, and combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA), and quantitative SB-COBRA was performed to study methylation of the TWIST2 promoter. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays were used to study TWIST2 expression in CLL cells. Following identification and confirmation of TWIST2 methylation in CLL patients, we demonstrated that expression of this transcription factor is related to the degree of promoter methylation. Expression of TWIST2 in a CLL cell line in which the promoter is methylated was increased following decitabine treatment. We next studied 53 patients by COBRA and demonstrated that 72% of patient samples with mutated Ig V(H) show TWIST2 methylation, while only 16% of patient samples with unmutated Ig V(H) were methylated (P < .001). In a subset of patients, methylation of TWIST2 correlated with mRNA expression. TWIST2 is differentially methylated in CLL cells relative to Ig V(H) mutational status and can be quantitatively monitored by SB-COBRA.

Genetics and molecular biology of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Current treatment options in oncology,Curr Treat Options Oncol,2005-05-01,"B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a clinically heterogeneous disease characterized by accumulation of malignant CD5+ B cells. Multiple molecular events likely contribute to malignant transformation; no single genetic abnormality or event has been shown to be responsible for development of the disease. Significant advances have recently been made towards understanding the genetic and molecular basis for the etiology and clinical course of CLL. Our current understanding is only now bringing us to the point where we can use this information in management and in developing new therapies for patients with CLL. Familial clustering of CLL cases is not uncommon and implicates a genetic basis for the development of the disease in some individuals. Potential interventions in this instance could employ strategies of gene transfer or gene therapy to correct genetic defects or strategies of chemoprevention, none of which is currently under investigation. Greater potential for therapeutic intervention rests with targeting molecular aberrations and altered gene expression in leukemia cells, for example, over expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family. CLL follows a variable clinical course, with some patients not needing treatment for many years and responding to therapy completely and repeatedly. Other patients have rapidly progressive disease that is refractory to currently available agents and they quickly succumb to their disease. One major recent advance has been the identification of molecular and genetic prognostic factors that can be used in early-stage patients to identify those likely to rapidly progress. This affords the opportunity to tailor management for patients based on the predictable aggressiveness of their disease. Molecular and genetic findings are increasingly influencing management decisions in CLL.

Decitabine in chronic leukemias.,Seminars in hematology,Semin. Hematol.,2005-07-01,"5-Aza-2'-deoxycitidine (decitabine, Dacogen, Bloomington, MN) is a cytosine analogue that promotes hypomethylation of DNA and has documented efficacy in myeloid malignancies. Indeed, promising clinical results have been observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Aberrant methylation has also been found in chronic leukemias, providing a rationale for investigating the use of decitabine in these diseases.

This is a significant step towards achieving the ultimate goal of disease-eradication and improved survival. A continuing problem, however, is the susceptibility of these patients to infections. Profound dysregulation of the host immune system in patients with CLL and its impact on the clinical course of the disease are well established. A number of investigators have sought to identify the mechanisms underlying this innate immune dysfunction, which is further exacerbated by the actions of the potent therapeutic agents. The early recognition of infections as well as prophylactic administration of appropriate antibiotics has been the mainstay of managing infections in patients with CLL.

Using immunohistochemical methods, we assessed for HSP90 expression in 412 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In B-cell lymphomas, HSP90 was moderately to strongly expressed in all cases of Burkitt's lymphoma (5/5, 100%), and in subsets of follicular lymphoma (17/28, 61%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (27/46, 59%), nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (6/16, 38%), plasma cell neoplasms (14/39, 36%), small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (3/9, 33%), mantle cell lymphoma (12/38, 32%) and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (3/10, 30%). HSP90 was weakly expressed in six of 14 (43%) cases of extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue.

Primary lymphocytes from CLL patients were incubated with 10 micromol/L 8-NH(2)-adenosine for 2, 4, and 6 or 8 hours. The accumulation of analogue triphosphate and the decline in endogenous ATP pool were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Inhibition of global RNA and protein synthesis was measured and correlated with specific decline in transcript and protein levels of MCL-1, XIAP, and BCL-2, the key survival factors of CLL. These biochemical and molecular end points were related to cell death of these quiescent lymphocytes. In vitro incubations of CLL lymphocytes with 8-NH(2)-adenosine resulted in rapid but heterogeneous accumulation of 8-NH(2)-ATP (390-680 micromol/L), with a concomitant decline in endogenous ATP (median, >50% by 4 hour). Global RNA synthesis was decreased in all samples and was associated with a decline in MCL-1, XIAP, and BCL-2 transcripts. There was a parallel decrease in the protein level of MCL-1 and XIAP but not BCL-2. These biochemical changes were accompanied by apoptosis.

Evolution of treatment strategies in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

This advancement is due in part to increasing awareness of prognostic factors and molecular heterogeneity of the disease which has helped to identify distinct risk groups of CLL.

Revisiting the role of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Expert review of anticancer therapy,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,2005-10-01,"Since the advent of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation more than 40 years ago, numerous methods of transplantation have been developed, modified and improved upon. Although hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been used in a variety of malignant diseases since then, its use in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia has recently started to gain interest. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia are generally elderly, and because of its relatively benign course, they were not considered suitable candidates for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Nonetheless, there have been marked improvements in transplantation techniques, including better conditioning regimens that have decreased treatment-related morbidity and mortality.

"Phase I study of low-dose interleukin-2, fludarabine, and cyclophosphamide for previously untreated indolent lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2005-12-01,"Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide is an effective combination but increases the risk of opportunistic infections due to depressed lymphocyte counts. In an attempt to preserve CD4 counts, we conducted a phase I, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) added to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide in patients with treatment-naive indolent lymphomas or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Subcutaneous IL-2 (days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle) was combined with cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2, day 8) and fludarabine (20 mg/m2, days 8-12) at four dose levels: 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.4 x 10(6) IU/m2/d. IL-2 dose was escalated in cohorts of four to six patients, with one patient per cohort receiving placebo. Twenty-three patients, median age 50, were enrolled, of whom 30% had chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and 52% had follicular lymphomas. The combination was generally well tolerated, with mainly hematologic toxicities. CD4 counts typically declined substantially during the early weeks of treatment and remained suppressed for months afterward. In the 18 evaluable patients who received IL-2, the mean absolute CD4 count was 999 cells/microL (range, 97-3,776) pretreatment, 379 cells/microL (range, 54-2,599) at day 14, and 98 cells/microL (range, 17-291) at end of treatment. In longitudinal linear models, the changes in CD4 counts were not significantly different across IL-2 dose levels.

However, published studies of Zap-70 expression have used different commercial antibodies and analytic strategies. This study was undertaken to determine if any strategy was broadly applicable in a clinical flow cytometry laboratory. Expression of Zap-70 was determined in 37 CLL patients using four different commercial antibodies. T, NK, and CLL cells were identified by immunophenotyping along with Zap-70 expression. Data was analyzed in terms of both percent of CLL cells expressing Zap-70 and the ratio of Zap-70 expression in CLL cells compared to that in T + NK cells. Three Zap-70 antibodies showed wide ranges of Zap-70 expression as a percentage of tumor cells, while a fourth gave consistently elevated results.

Select high-risk genetic features predict earlier progression following chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine and rituximab in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: justification for risk-adapted therapy.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2005-12-12,"Several new prognostic factors predicting rapid disease progression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have been identified, including unmutated Ig V(H) mutational status, del(11)(q23), del(17)(p13.1), and p53 mutations. To date, the impact of these same prognostic factors have not been examined relative to treatment outcome with chemoimmunotherapy. We examined the impact of these new prognostic factors on predicting treatment outcome in symptomatic, untreated CLL patients who received chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine and rituximab as part of a completed, randomized phase II study, Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9712. Eighty-eight patients treated as part of CALGB 9712 had detailed prognostic factor assessment performed. Using Ig V(H) mutational status to classify risk, there was no association between complete response rate with either unmutated Ig V(H) mutational status or high-risk interphase cytogenetics. However, the median progression-free survival (PFS; P = .048) and overall survival (OS; P = .01) were shorter among the Ig V(H) unmutated patients as compared with the Ig V(H) mutated patients.

A retrospective comparison of three sequential groups of patients with Recurrent/Refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with fludarabine-based regimens.,Cancer,Cancer,2006-01-01,"Combining therapeutics with single-agent activity has improved treatment for patients with many malignancies. Debate continues about the impact of treatment on survival in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Purine analogues are the most active agents for treatment of patients with CLL. Recently, it was shown that a chemoimmunotherapy regimen combining fludarabine (F), cyclophosphamide (C), and rituximab (R) (FCR) was very effective in treating patients with recurrent and/or refractory CLL. The objective of the current analysis was to determine whether improvements in treatment have had an impact on survival for patients with CLL. Three nonoverlapping, sequential groups of patients enrolled on Phase II studies who received treatment with F (n = 251 patients), FC (n = 111 patients), or FCR (n = 143 patients) were analyzed. Pretreatment characteristics, responses to treatment, and overall survival were compared. Patients who were treated with FCR had a higher complete remission rate compared with patients who were treated with combined F and C or with F alone. Statistically significantly longer estimated median survival was noted for patients who received FCR. A Cox proportional hazards, multivariable model for overall survival that included all patients (n = 505) showed that patients who received FCR had longer survival (P < 0.0001) after adjusting for other significant (P < 0.05) pretreatment characteristics, including age, hemoglobin, beta-2 microglobulin, and the number of prior treatments.

CpG island methylation and expression of the secreted frizzled-related protein gene family in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2006-01-01,"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by a clonal accumulation of mature neoplastic B cells indicating disruption of apoptosis. Restriction Landmark Genome Scanning was done to identify novel target genes silenced by CpG island methylation in CLL. Secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4), a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway, was found to be frequently methylated in CLL samples. Wnt signaling has been shown to control normal apoptotic behavior and is required for normal B-cell development whereas aberrant activation of this pathway has been observed in CLL. We show aberrant DNA methylation and silencing of SFRP4, as well as of additional SFRP family members, in primary CLL samples. Induction of their expression in a dose-dependent manner following treatment with a demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, was shown. Of the five SFRP family members studied in detail, SFRP1 was hypermethylated and down-regulated in all CLL patient samples studied, suggesting that this epigenetic event is a critical step during leukemogenesis.

Elevated serum B-lymphocyte stimulator levels in patients with familial lymphoproliferative disorders.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2006-01-23,"Serum B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) levels have been found to be elevated in a number of immune disease models. Therefore, we sought to establish whether BLyS levels were elevated in patients with B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders and to determine whether elevated BLyS levels correlated with clinical characteristics of the disease. Specimens were collected from the peripheral blood of individuals diagnosed with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL; n = 70) or from age- and sex-matched patients seen at the same institution (n = 41). Serum BLyS levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and sequencing of the BLyS promoter was performed by conventional methods and confirmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. We found that elevated BLyS levels were more common in patients with familial B-CLL than individuals with sporadic B-CLL or normal controls. Because of this association, we sequenced the BLyS promoter in patients with B-CLL and normal controls and identified a polymorphic site, -871 C/T. We found that the wild-type sequence was significantly underrepresented in patients with familial B-CLL (4%) compared with patients with sporadic B-CLL (30%; P = .01) or controls (24%; P = .04).

The shaving reaction: rituximab/CD20 complexes are removed from mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells by THP-1 monocytes.,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",J. Immunol.,2006-02-01,"Clinical investigations have revealed that infusion of immunotherapeutic mAbs directed to normal or tumor cells can lead to loss of targeted epitopes, a phenomenon called antigenic modulation. Recently, we reported that rituximab treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients induced substantial loss of CD20 on B cells found in the circulation after rituximab infusion, when rituximab plasma concentrations were high. Such antigenic modulation can severely compromise therapeutic efficacy, and we postulated that B cells had been stripped (shaved) of the rituximab/CD20 complex by monocytes or macrophages in a reaction mediated by FcgammaR. We developed an in vitro model to replicate this in vivo shaving process, based on reacting rituximab-opsonized CD20(+) cells with acceptor THP-1 monocytes. After 45 min at 37 degrees C, rituximab and CD20 are removed from opsonized cells, and both are demonstrable on acceptor THP-1 cells.

Hematol.,2006-03-04,"In an attempt to exploit bcl-2 overexpression and aberrant p53 function, two frequently encountered aberrations that predict marked treatment resistance and worse prognosis in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), we combined theophylline, pentostatin, and chlorambucil at two dose levels (cohort I: 30 mg/m(2); cohort II: 20 mg/m(2)) on a 21-day cycle for up to six courses. We employed a phase I/II design to determine feasibility, define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and explore the impact of biologic modulation on response and time to progression (TTP) in 20 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL and NHL. Eight patients were enrolled in cohort I. They demonstrated a response rate (RR) of 28% and a 16.5-month TTP after receiving a median of two cycles. A 50% RR was observed in this cohort when patients with adverse histologies were excluded. Because of myelotoxicity, this dose level defined the MTD, and de-escalation occurred. All 12 patients in cohort II received 20 mg/m(2) chlorambucil. A 50% RR and an 18-month TTP were observed after a median of 5.5 cycles. An RR of 47% and a complete remission (CR) of 5% were observed for the entire group, although responses and TTP varied greatly by histology. Significant activity was observed in patients with B-cell CLL and follicular lymphoma (FL). RR and TTP for fludarabine-sensitive/naïve and fludarabine-refractory (FR) B-cell CLL patients were 66 vs 25% and 20 vs 8.5 months, respectively. Both FL patients responded (one with partial remission and one with CR), with a 22.5-monthly median TTP. For responding patients, median TTP and overall survival (OS) was 21 and 69 months, respectively, compared to a median TTP of 2 months and an OS of 13.5 months for nonresponders.

Clin. Oncol.,2006-03-06,"Purine analogs and alkylators are important agents for treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Early studies combining fludarabine and chlorambucil were abandoned owing to increased toxicity from overlapping myelosuppression and immunosuppression. Of the purine analogs active in CLL, pentostatin appears to be the least myelosuppressive. We previously reported that pentostatin and cyclophosphamide (PC) is active and well-tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. Subsequently, we added rituximab, and now report on this three-drug combination. We treated 46 patients with either previously treated CLL (32 patients) or other low-grade B-cell neoplasms (14 patients). Patients received pentostatin 4 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, and rituximab 375 mg/m2 (PCR). All drugs were administered on the same day (rituximab omitted from cycle 1), and patients received six cycles at 3-week intervals. Filgrastim, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and acyclovir were administered prophylactically. The median age was 62 years (range, 30 to 80 years). The median number of prior regimens was two (range, one to seven). For CLL patients, there were 24 responses (75%), including eight complete responses (25%). In fludarabine-refractory patients, 75% responded. Toxicity was acceptable, with grade 3/4 infections (including fever of unknown origin) in 28%. The regimen was well tolerated, with 72% of patients receiving the planned treatment at full dose. PCR is safe and effective in previously treated patients with CLL. In comparison with our prior two-drug regimen, we find that rituximab did not seem to add significantly to the toxicity, but did appear to confer a survival advantage.

Mdm2 inhibitor Nutlin-3a induces p53-mediated apoptosis by transcription-dependent and transcription-independent mechanisms and may overcome Atm-mediated resistance to fludarabine in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2006-03-16,"Although TP53 mutations are rare in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Mdm2 overexpression has been reported as an alternative cause of p53 dysfunction. We investigated the potential therapeutic use of nongenotoxic p53 activation by a small-molecule antagonist of Mdm2, Nutlin-3a, in CLL. Nutlin-3a induced significant apoptosis in 30 (91%) of 33 samples from previously untreated patients with CLL; all resistant samples had TP53 mutations. Low levels of Atm (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) or high levels of Mdm2 (murine double minute 2) did not prevent Nutlin-3a from inducing apoptosis. Nutlin-3a used transcription-dependent and transcription-independent pathways to induce p53-mediated apoptosis. Predominant activation of the transcription-independent pathway induced more pronounced apoptosis than that of the transcription-dependent pathway, suggesting that activation of the transcription-independent pathway is sufficient to initiate p53-mediated apoptosis in CLL. Combination treatment of Nutlin-3a and fludarabine synergistically increased p53 levels, and induced conformational change of Bax and apoptosis in wild-type p53 cells but not in cells with mutant p53.

Plasma thrombopoietin compared with immunoglobulin heavy-chain mutation status as a predictor of survival in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2006-03-21,"We investigated the association of plasma thrombopoietin (TPO) and overall survival in 127 patients with previously treated and previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Higher levels of TPO were associated with advanced Rai stage (P < .001), higher levels of beta(2)-microglobulin (beta2-M) (P < .001), and the absence of mutation in the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IgV(H)) (P < .001), and were inversely correlated with platelet count (P = .002). We found that TPO correlated strongly in a continuous manner with overall survival in both previously treated and untreated patients. The univariate Cox proportional hazard model demonstrated that high TPO levels were associated with shorter survival (P < .001), and multiple variable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis demonstrated that this was independent of the IgV(H) mutation status, beta2-M, and Rai stage. Recursive partitioning showed that a cutoff point of 639 pg/mL separated the CLL patients into 2 major survival groups (P < .001). The effects of beta2-M were masked by the effects of TPO in the patients with TPO levels higher than 639 pg/mL, but in the remainder, patients with beta2-M level higher than 4.95 mg/L had significantly shorter survival than those with lower values.

This review provides an overview of the clinical and biologic importance of angiogenesis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Patients with CLL have detectable levels of both plasma and cellular pro- and anti-angiogenic cytokines, as well as abnormal neovascularization in the marrow and lymph nodes. Recent evidence suggests a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-based autocrine pathway promotes the survival of CLL B cells in part through upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins. Additionally, interactions between CLL B cells and their microenvironment generate alterations in the secretion of angiogenic factors that result in enhanced leukemic B-cell resistance to apoptotic cell death. From a clinical standpoint, interpatient variation is observed in markers of angiogenesis and appears to have prognostic implications. Several clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of anti-angiogenic agents for treatment of patients with CLL are underway with promising preliminary results.

Initial therapy for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2006-04-01,"Evolution of frontline treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has been driven by the objective of increasing complete remission (CR) rates and achieving maximum elimination of leukemia. As a result, effective combination regimens incorporating new agents such as monoclonal antibodies have been developed. Beyond morphologic CR, evaluation for residual disease by multicolor flow cytometry or molecular techniques may provide a tool to assess potentially more effective therapies.

A recently described TCL-1 transgenic mouse develops a chronic B-cell CD5(+) leukemia that might be useful for such studies. Following confirmation of the natural history of this leukemia in the transgenic mice, we demonstrated that the transformed murine lymphocytes express relevant therapeutic targets (Bcl-2, Mcl-1, AKT, PDK1, and DNMT1), wild-type p53 status, and in vitro sensitivity to therapeutic agents relevant to the treatment of human CLL. We then demonstrated the in vivo clinical activity of low-dose fludarabine in transgenic TCL-1 mice with active leukemia. These studies demonstrated both early reduction in blood-lymphocyte count and spleen size and prolongation of survival (P = .046) compared with control mice. Similar to human CLL, an emergence of resistance was noted with fludarabine treatment in vivo.

Activity of alemtuzumab in patients with CD52-positive acute leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2006-06-01,"Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the cell surface antigen CD52 and has demonstrated activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other CD52-positive lymphoproliferative disorders. Because CD52 also is expressed on acute leukemic blasts, the authors investigated the safety and efficacy of alemtuzumab in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Fifteen patients with CD52-positive (> or = 20%), recurrent or refractory acute leukemia (9 patients with AML and 6 patients with ALL) received alemtuzumab at a dose of 30 mg intravenously given 3 times a week (dose escalation during Week 1) for a total of 4 to 12 weeks. The median age of the patients was 39 years (range, 18-71 years). Patients had received a median of 3 prior therapies (range, 1-5 prior therapies). Two patients (13%) achieved a bone marrow complete response and 1 patient achieved a substantial reduction in bone marrow blasts. No complete remissions were observed. Ten patients developed disease progression while on study. Alemtuzumab was myelosuppressive in nearly all patients. Infusion-related toxicities were common, but usually did not exceed Grade 2 (according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria).

Outcomes in patients with splenic marginal zone lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma treated with rituximab with or without chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone.,Cancer,Cancer,2006-07-01,"The optimal management of patients with splenic marginal zone lymphoma/marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) is controversial. The objective of this retrospective study was to compare the outcomes of patients with SMZL who received treatment with rituximab, rituximab plus chemotherapy, or chemotherapy alone. The Leukemia Service database was searched for patients with splenic lymphoma who were registered between May 1995 and October 2004. The indications for treatment were the same as those used for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. SMZL was confirmed in 70 patients. The median age was 64 years. The median number of CD20 molecules per cell was 69 x 10(3). Forty-three patients required systemic therapy; rituximab in 26 patients, chemotherapy plus rituximab in 6 patients, and chemotherapy alone in 11 patients. Ten additional patients underwent splenectomy, and 17 patients were in the observation group. The overall response rates were 88% with rituximab, 83% with rituximab plus chemotherapy, and 55% with chemotherapy alone; the 3-year survival rates were 95%, 100%, and 55%, respectively. The 3-year failure-free survival (FFS) rates were 86%, 100%, and 45% in the rituximab, rituximab plus chemotherapy, and chemotherapy alone groups, respectively. Rituximab treatments resulted in longer survival and FFS compared with chemotherapy. Rituximab alone resulted in disappearance of splenomegaly in 92% of patients and normalization of absolute lymphocyte counts. In univariate analysis, younger age and rituximab-based therapy were predictive of longer FFS. Rituximab with or without chemotherapy was found to have major activity in patients with SMZL.

The role of alemtuzumab in nonmyeloablative hematopoietic transplantation.,Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2006-04-01,"Nonmyeloablative stem cell transplants provide a viable therapeutic option for older patients or patients with comorbid conditions, who were previously deemed to be ineligible for transplantation. Despite improvements in clinical outcomes, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a significant and potentially lethal complication. One approach by which GVHD has been managed is through introduction of new agents, such as alemtuzumab, into the conditioning regimen. Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the CD52 antigen, which is highly expressed on both B and T lymphocytes. By depleting T cells in both the donor and the recipient, alemtuzumab has been shown to prevent development of both acute and chronic GVHD, without inhibiting the benefits associated with the graft-versus-leukemia effect. Clinical trials have shown that alemtuzumab is able to decrease the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD without impairing engraftment. Furthermore, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia therapy, alemtuzumab has been shown to purge malignant cells from the host to allow for harvesting for the purpose of autologous transplantation. Despite results showing that alemtuzumab can play an important role in managing GVHD, little information is available regarding a standardized dosing schedule. Greater insight into alemtuzumab's pharmacokinetic activity would assist in developing a schedule that can optimize alemtuzumab-mediated T-cell depletion to prevent GVHD, while retaining sufficient host T-cell activity to encourage the graft-versus-leukemia effect and prevent relapse.",Journal Article,5043.0,16.0,Nonmyeloablative stem cell transplants provide a viable therapeutic option for older patients or patients with comorbid conditions who were previously deemed to be ineligible for transplantation Despite improvements in clinical outcomes graft-versus-host disease GVHD remains a significant and potentially lethal complication One approach by which GVHD has been managed is through introduction of new agents such as alemtuzumab into the conditioning regimen Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the CD52 antigen which is highly expressed on both B and T lymphocytes By depleting T cells in both the donor and the recipient alemtuzumab has been shown to prevent development of both acute and chronic GVHD without inhibiting the benefits associated with the graft-versus-leukemia effect Clinical trials have shown that alemtuzumab is able to decrease the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD without impairing engraftment Furthermore in chronic lymphocytic therapy alemtuzumab has been shown to purge malignant cells from the host to allow for harvesting for the purpose of autologous transplantation Despite results showing that alemtuzumab can play an important role in managing GVHD little information is available regarding a standardized dosing schedule Greater insight into alemtuzumab 's pharmacokinetic activity would assist in developing a schedule that can optimize alemtuzumab-mediated T-cell depletion to prevent GVHD while retaining sufficient host T-cell activity to encourage the graft-versus-leukemia effect and prevent relapse,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[6094, 452, 31, 4016, 377, 8, 2663, 189, 1501, 9, 434, 7, 15, 7, 5, 3952, 1298, 54, 11, 373, 3779, 6, 40, 3773, 9, 497, 550, 1474, 4, 38, 123, 1599, 185, 1204, 34, 1562, 469, 8, 93, 2, 751, 2266, 1447, 104, 353, 20, 92, 1562, 71, 85, 2231, 16, 298, 2456, 1, 217, 183, 225, 22, 3579, 237, 3, 1933, 477, 3579, 16, 8, 3619, 848, 548, 17, 637, 3, 7189, 448, 92, 16, 561, 570, 23, 110, 132, 2, 102, 1594, 20, 9438, 102, 37, 4, 110, 3, 1488, 2, 3, 5783, 3579, 71, 85, 443, 6, 1682, 193, 1, 110, 286, 2, 442, 1562, 187, 2062, 3, 1141, 41, 5, 3, 1599, 185, 2647, 254, 38, 143, 47, 443, 17, 3579, 16, 1665, 6, 775, 3, 287, 1, 286, 2, 442, 1562, 187, 12880, 2881, 798, 4, 442, 1193, 36, 3579, 71, 85, 443, 6, 33265, 393, 37, 29, 3, 1204, 6, 1700, 9, 17700, 9, 3, 743, 1, 1028, 497, 550, 99, 2069, 17, 3579, 122, 1343, 35, 305, 200, 4, 3969, 1562, 1215, 487, 16, 390, 666, 8, 1670, 1280, 1055, 378, 2670, 237, 3579, 292, 1456, 128, 688, 3425, 4, 931, 8, 1055, 17, 122, 2465, 3579, 517, 102, 31, 2286, 6, 1682, 1562, 369, 14171, 1952, 1204, 102, 31, 128, 6, 7113, 3, 1599, 185, 2647, 254, 2, 1682, 429]",1563.0,16720202,101
Loss of TP53 is due to rearrangements involving chromosome region 17p10 approximately p12 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,Cancer Genet. Cytogenet.,2006-06-01,"Loss of tumor protein 53 (TP53) has been associated with aggressive disease and poor response to therapy in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). TP53 is located at chromosome band 17p13 and its absence can be detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in the interphase nuclei of 8-10% patients with B-CLL. To study the cytogenetic mechanism for loss of TP53, metaphase and interphase FISH studies were conducted on 16 B-CLL patients to investigate 17p10 to 17p12, a chromosome region known to be rich in low-copy DNA repeats. Loss of TP53 was caused by an isochromosome with breakpoints between 17p10 and 17p11.2 in four patients, an unbalanced translocation involving 17p10 to 17p11.2 in nine patients, and an unbalanced translocation involving 17p11.2 to 17p12 in three patients. These findings indicate that loss of TP53 results from the absence of nearly the entire chromosome 17 p-arm rather than to monosomy 17 or deletions of TP53.

EBERs were detected in the bone marrow of 12 of 32 (38%) CLL/SLL marrows vs 0 of 20 normal marrows (p = 0.002). EBERs were observed in sporadic granulocytes alone or in addition to its presence in lymphocytes in nine of the 12 EBV-positive patients. EBERs were detected less frequently in patients with Rai stage 0 - 1 disease (20%) compared with Rai stage 2 - 4 (66%; p = 0.008).

This article reviews older prognostic factors such as beta2-microglobulin and thymidine kinase activity that have been partially validated by recently completed large studies. New prognostic factors such as interphase cytogenetics, immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene mutational analysis, and relevant secondary surrogate markers of immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene, including methylation of the zeta-associated protein gene, lipoprotein lipase overexpression, telomere length, and telomerase activity are reviewed. Some prognostic factors (interphase cytogenetics) but not others (immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene mutational status, zeta-associated protein expression) predict the duration of response to fludarabine-based combination strategies.

"Forodesine, an inhibitor of purine nucleoside phosphorylase, induces apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.",Blood,Blood,2006-06-15,"Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency in humans results in T lymphocytopenia. Forodesine, a potent inhibitor of PNP, was designed based on the transition-state structure stabilized by the enzyme. Previous studies established that forodesine in the presence of deoxyguanosine (dGuo) inhibits the proliferation of T lymphocytes. A phase 1 clinical trial of forodesine in T-cell malignancies demonstrated significant antileukemic activity with an increase in intracellular dGuo triphosphate (dGTP). High accumulation of dGTP in T cells may be dependent on the levels of deoxynucleoside kinases. Because B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells have high activity of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), we hypothesized that these lymphocytes would respond to forodesine. This postulate was tested in primary lymphocytes during in vitro investigations. Lymphocytes from 12 patients with CLL were incubated with forodesine and dGuo. These CLL cells showed a wide variation in the accumulation of intracellular dGTP without any effect on other deoxynucleotides.

Gene-expression profiling of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia reveals a phenotype more similar to chronic lymphocytic leukemia than multiple myeloma.,Blood,Blood,2006-06-27,"Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) is a B-cell malignancy characterized by the ability of the B-cell clone to differentiate into plasma cells. Although the clinical syndrome and the pathologic characteristics are well defined, little is known about its biology and controversy still exists regarding its cell of origin. In this gene-expression study, we compared the transcription profiles of WM with those of other malignant B cells including (chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL] and multiple myeloma [MM]) as well as normal cells (peripheral-blood B cells and bone marrow plasma cells). We found that WM has a homogenous gene expression regardless of 6q deletion status and clusters with CLL and normal B cells on unsupervised clustering with very similar expression profiles. Only a small gene set has expression profiles unique to WM compared to CLL and MM. The most significantly up-regulated gene is IL6 and the most significantly associated pathway for this set of genes is MAPK signaling. Thus, IL6 and its downstream signaling may be of biologic importance in WM.

Safety and efficacy of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillations in steroid treated and immunocompromised patients.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2006-08-01,"We assessed the safety and efficacy of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillations in steroid treated and immunocompromised patients. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 697 patients treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillations at our institution from 1991 to 2004. In 24 patients (3.5%) an underlying comorbidity directly affecting the immune system was diagnosed before bacillus Calmette-Guerin administration or steroids were administered at least 6 weeks before and at the time of bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillations. The immunosuppressive effect of steroids was assessed by the percent of lymphocytes. End points were the bacillus Calmette-Guerin response at 6 months, defined as normal cystoscopy, cytology and biopsy when available, and treatment related toxicity. Four patients (17%) had active lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia during bacillus Calmette-Guerin administration and 21 (88%) had a concurrent condition for which oral steroids (11), inhaled steroids (14) or oral and inhaled steroids (4) were administered. Patients treated with oral steroids had a lower percent of lymphocytes than patients treated with inhaled steroids and 15 age matched patients with high risk superficial bladder cancer and no steroid treatment (12.3% vs 17.5% and 18.6%, respectively). The overall bacillus Calmette-Guerin response rate at 6 months was 58%. Ten of the 24 patients had disease recurrence and 3 had disease progression at a median followup of 63.5 months (IQR 19.5, 89). One patient treated with oral steroids had self-limited febrile disease and worsening of myalgia 48 hours after his third bacillus Calmette-Guerin cycle. No other systemic adverse event following bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy was recorded and all patients completed scheduled treatments. Intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin is a viable therapeutic option in patients with high risk superficial bladder cancer and concomitant lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, treatment with low dose oral steroids or treatment with inhaled steroids. The bacillus Calmette-Guerin response rate at 6 months and the side effects profile associated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy in these patients were comparable to those in patients with no evidence of immunosuppression.

Role of angiogenesis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2006-09-01,"Angiogenesis is a physiologic process of new blood vessels formation mediated by various cytokines called angiogenic and angiostatic factors. Although its potential pathophysiologic role in solid tumors has been extensively studied for more than 3 decades, enhancement of angiogenesis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other malignant hematological disorders has been recognized more recently. An increased level of angiogenesis has been documented by various experimental methods both in bone marrow and lymph nodes of patients with CLL. Although the role of angiogenesis in the pathophysiology of this disease remains to be fully elucidated, experimental data suggest that several angiogenic factors play a role in the disease progression.

Phase II study of single-agent bortezomib for the treatment of patients with fludarabine-refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2006-09-01,"Therapeutic options are limited and the prognosis is poor for patients with fludarabine-refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Bortezomib induces apoptosis in vitro in CLL cells, both alone and in combination, including in cells resistant to fludarabine or other agents. The aim of the current randomized, open-label, Phase II study was to investigate the clinical activity of bortezomib in patients with fludarabine-refractory B-cell CLL. Twenty-two patients with histologically confirmed B-cell CLL were treated with bortezomib at doses of 1.0 mg/m2, 1.3 mg/m2, or 1.5 mg/m2 on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day treatment cycle for a maximum of 9 cycles. None of 19 patients evaluable for response achieved complete remission or partial response; however, signs of biologic activity based on disease site responses (e.g., reduction in lymphocytosis, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy) were observed. In the 1.5 mg/m2 dose group, a higher proportion of patients had stable disease, and a lower proportion had progressive disease compared with the 2 lower-dose groups. Eleven patients, all in the 2 higher dose groups, experienced Grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) (according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0]); 2 patients experienced Grade 4 neutropenia.

Phase I/II study of the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus (RAD001) in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2006-09-01,"Everolimus (RAD001, Novartis), an oral derivative of rapamycin, inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which regulates many aspects of cell growth and division. A phase I/II study was done to determine safety and efficacy of everolimus in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies. Two dose levels (5 and 10 mg orally once daily continuously) were evaluated in the phase I portion of this study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of everolimus to be used in the phase II study. Twenty-seven patients (9 acute myelogenous leukemia, 5 myelodysplastic syndrome, 6 B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 4 mantle cell lymphoma, 1 myelofibrosis, 1 natural killer cell/T-cell leukemia, and 1 T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia) received everolimus. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Grade 3 potentially drug-related toxicities included hyperglycemia (22%), hypophosphatemia (7%), fatigue (7%), anorexia (4%), and diarrhea (4%). One patient developed a cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis requiring a skin graft. One patient with refractory anemia with excess blasts achieved a major platelet response of over 3-month duration. A second patient with refractory anemia with excess blasts showed a minor platelet response of 25-day duration. Phosphorylation of downstream targets of mTOR, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1, and/or, p70 S6 kinase, was inhibited in six of nine patient samples, including those from the patient with a major platelet response. Everolimus is well tolerated at a daily dose of 10 mg daily and may have activity in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.

Quality-of-life and health benefits of early treatment of mild anemia: a randomized trial of epoetin alfa in patients receiving chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies.,Cancer,Cancer,2006-10-01,"Chemotherapy-related anemia is prevalent among patients with hematologic malignancies. A randomized, open-label, multicenter trial of early versus late epoetin alfa in this population was conducted, focusing on quality of life (QOL). Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or multiple myeloma and baseline hemoglobin of 10 to 12 g/dL who were scheduled for > or = 4 months of myelosuppressive chemotherapy were randomized to receive < or = 16 weeks of epoetin alfa at a dose of 40,000 U once weekly immediately (early) or to wait and only receive epoetin alfa if hemoglobin decreased to < 9 g/dL (late). Those patients with a hemoglobin level > 12 g/dL after 3 chemotherapy cycles were not randomized. The primary endpoint was a mean change in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) total. In all, 269 patients with a hemoglobin level < or = 12 g/dL were randomized. The mean total FACT-An increased 3.84 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.21-7.46) in early patients and decreased 4.37 (95% CI, -7.99 to -0.74) in late patients (P = .003). Early patients had significantly (P < .05) higher mean scores for total FACT-General; FACT-General physical and functional well-being subscales, total anemia scale, and fatigue subscale; and daily activity, energy, and important activity Linear Analog Scale Assessment scales, as well as reduced bedrest days and restricted activity days.

"Narrative review: initial management of newly diagnosed, early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",Annals of internal medicine,Ann. Intern. Med.,2006-09-01,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is one of the most common malignant lymphoid diseases in the western world and is frequently diagnosed by internists. There have been clinically significant changes in method of diagnosis, prognostic tools, supportive care, and treatment over the past 2 decades. Most patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia now have Rai stage 0 or I disease at diagnosis. Patients with early-stage disease are a heterogeneous group: Approximately 30% to 50% will have accelerated disease progression, and the remainder may live for decades and possibly never require therapy. Recent insights into the biological characteristics of leukemic B cells have led to the discovery of new prognostic tools (immunoglobulin variable-region heavy chain gene mutation status, cytogenetic abnormalities assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridization, and Z-chain-associated protein kinase-70 protein expression) that can identify patients with early-stage disease who are at high risk for early disease progression. These tools allow physicians to individualize counseling, follow-up, and management on the basis of disease risk. In addition, new treatments developed over the past 2 decades (purine nucleoside analogues, monoclonal antibodies, and combination chemoimmunotherapy regimens) have dramatically improved response rates and appear to prolong survival. In this review, the authors discuss the current work-up of lymphocytosis and highlight how to use recently identified prognostic tools to stratify risk in patients with newly diagnosed, early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

"Flavopiridol administered using a pharmacologically derived schedule is associated with marked clinical efficacy in refractory, genetically high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",Blood,Blood,2006-09-26,"Despite promising preclinical studies with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other diseases, previous clinical trials with this agent have been disappointing. The discovery of differential protein binding of flavopiridol in human and bovine serum contributed to an effective pharmacokinetic-derived schedule of administration of this agent. On the basis of pharmacokinetic modeling using our in vitro results and data from a previous trial, we initiated a phase 1 study using a 30-minute loading dose followed by 4 hours of infusion administered weekly for 4 of 6 weeks in patients with refractory CLL. A group of 42 patients were enrolled on 3 cohorts (cohort 1, 30 mg/m2 loading dose followed by 30 mg/m2 4-hour infusion; cohort 2, 40 mg/m2 loading dose followed by 40 mg/m2 4-hour infusion; and cohort 3, cohort 1 dose for treatments 1 to 4, then a 30 mg/m2 loading dose followed by a 50 mg/m2 4-hour infusion). The dose-limiting toxicity using this novel schedule was hyperacute tumor lysis syndrome. Aggressive prophylaxis and exclusion of patients with leukocyte counts greater than 200x10(9)/L have made this drug safe to administer at the cohort 3 dose. Of the 42 patients treated, 19 (45%) achieved a partial response with a median response duration that exceeds 12 months. Responses were noted in patients with genetically high-risk disease, including 5 (42%) of 12 patients with del(17p13.1) and 13 (72%) of 18 patients with del(11q22.3).

Prospective evaluation of clonal evolution during long-term follow-up of patients with untreated early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2006-10-01,"Retrospective studies suggest cytogenetic abnormalities detected by interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) can identify patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who will experience a more aggressive disease course. Other studies suggest that patients may acquire chromosome abnormalities during the course of their disease. There are minimal prospective data on the clinical utility of the widely used hierarchical FISH prognostic categories in patients with newly diagnosed early-stage CLL or the frequency of clonal evolution as determined by interphase FISH. Between 1994 and 2002, we enrolled 159 patients with previously untreated CLL (83% Rai stage 0/I) on a prospective trial evaluating clonal evolution by FISH. Patients provided baseline and follow-up specimens for FISH testing during 2 to 12 years. Chromosomal abnormalities detected by FISH at study entry predicted overall survival. Eighteen patients experienced clonal evolution during follow-up. The rate of clonal evolution increased with duration of follow-up with only one occurrence in the first 2 years (n = 71; 1.4%) but 17 occurrences (n = 63; 27%) among patients tested after 5+ years. Clonal evolution occurred among 10% of ZAP-70-negative and 42% of ZAP-70-positive patients at 5+ years (P = .008). This clinical trial confirms prospectively that cytogenetic abnormalities detected by FISH can predict overall survival for CLL patients at the time of diagnosis, but also suggests that many patients acquire new abnormalities during the course of their disease. Patients with higher ZAP-70 expression may be more likely to experience such clonal evolution.

Cancer Res.,2006-10-01,"Preclinical studies suggested that bryostatin 1 might potentiate the therapeutic effects of fludarabine in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. We undertook a phase I study to identify appropriate schedules and doses of bryostatin 1 and fludarabine to be used in phase II studies. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or indolent lymphoma received fludarabine daily for 5 days and a single dose of bryostatin 1 via a 24-hour continuous infusion either before or after the fludarabine course. Doses were escalated in successive patients until recommended phase II doses for each sequence were identified on the basis of dose-limiting toxic events. Bryostatin 1 can be administered safely and tolerably with full dose fludarabine (25 mg/m(2)/d x 5). The recommended bryostatin 1 phase II dose is 50 microg/m(2) for both sequences, bryostatin 1 --> fludarabine and fludarabine --> bryostatin 1. The combination is active against both CLL and indolent lymphomas with responses seen in patients who had been previously treated with fludarabine. Correlative studies do not support the hypothesis that bryostatin 1 potentiates fludarabine activity through down-regulation of protein kinase C in target cells. Bryostatin 1 can be administered with full dose fludarabine, and the combination is moderately active in patients with persistent disease following prior treatment. In view of the activity of monoclonal antibodies such as the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab in the treatment of CLL and indolent lymphomas, the concept of combining bryostatin 1 and fludarabine with rituximab warrants future consideration.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",4860.0,40.0,Preclinical studies suggested that bryostatin 1 might potentiate the therapeutic effects of fludarabine in the treatment of hematologic malignancies We undertook a phase I study to identify appropriate schedules and doses of bryostatin 1 and fludarabine to be used in phase II studies Patients with chronic lymphocytic CLL or indolent received fludarabine daily for 5 days and a single dose of bryostatin 1 via a 24-hour continuous infusion either before or after the fludarabine course Doses were escalated in successive patients until recommended phase II doses for each sequence were identified on the basis of dose-limiting toxic events Bryostatin 1 can be administered safely and tolerably with full dose fludarabine 25 mg/m 2 /d x 5 The recommended bryostatin 1 phase II dose is 50 microg/m 2 for both sequences bryostatin 1 -- fludarabine and fludarabine -- bryostatin 1 The combination is active against both CLL and indolent lymphomas with responses seen in patients who had been previously treated with fludarabine Correlative studies do not support the hypothesis that bryostatin 1 potentiates fludarabine activity through down-regulation of protein kinase C in target cells Bryostatin 1 can be administered with full dose fludarabine and the combination is moderately active in patients with persistent disease following prior treatment In view of the activity of monoclonal antibodies such as the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab in the treatment of CLL and indolent lymphomas the concept of combining bryostatin 1 and fludarabine with rituximab warrants future consideration,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[693, 94, 1148, 17, 6574, 14, 822, 6428, 3, 189, 176, 1, 2027, 4, 3, 24, 1, 813, 441, 21, 5418, 8, 124, 70, 45, 6, 255, 870, 2314, 2, 415, 1, 6574, 14, 2, 2027, 6, 40, 95, 4, 124, 215, 94, 7, 5, 442, 1193, 552, 15, 2316, 103, 2027, 391, 9, 33, 162, 2, 8, 226, 61, 1, 6574, 14, 847, 8, 259, 2583, 1314, 904, 361, 348, 15, 50, 3, 2027, 906, 415, 11, 2842, 4, 6808, 7, 1100, 793, 124, 215, 415, 9, 296, 1532, 11, 108, 23, 3, 877, 1, 61, 817, 1812, 281, 6574, 14, 122, 40, 468, 2268, 2, 44494, 5, 1647, 61, 2027, 243, 81, 188, 18, 427, 1006, 33, 3, 793, 6574, 14, 124, 215, 61, 16, 212, 2440, 188, 18, 9, 110, 2866, 6574, 14, 2027, 2, 2027, 6574, 14, 3, 150, 16, 544, 480, 110, 552, 2, 2316, 1557, 5, 253, 527, 4, 7, 54, 42, 85, 373, 73, 5, 2027, 3679, 94, 1022, 44, 538, 3, 1492, 17, 6574, 14, 8091, 2027, 128, 298, 1328, 863, 1, 178, 216, 256, 4, 283, 37, 6574, 14, 122, 40, 468, 5, 1647, 61, 2027, 2, 3, 150, 16, 3508, 544, 4, 7, 5, 1882, 34, 366, 324, 24, 4, 3811, 1, 3, 128, 1, 848, 890, 225, 22, 3, 312, 2198, 848, 548, 855, 4, 3, 24, 1, 552, 2, 2316, 1557, 3, 2545, 1, 1525, 6574, 14, 2, 2027, 5, 855, 2782, 508, 2415]",1595.0,17020988,145

Thrice-weekly low-dose rituximab decreases CD20 loss via shaving and promotes enhanced targeting in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",J. Immunol.,2006-11-01,"Treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with standard dose infusion of rituximab (RTX), 375 mg/m2, induces clearance of malignant cells from peripheral blood after infusion of 30 mg of RTX. After completion of the full RTX infusion, substantial recrudescence of CLL cells occurs, and these cells have lost > 90% of CD20. To gain insight into mechanism(s) of CD20 loss, we investigated the hypothesis that thrice-weekly low-dose RTX (20 or 60 mg/m2) treatment for CLL over 4 wk would preserve CD20 and enhance leukemic cell clearance. During initial infusions in all 12 patients, the first 30 mg of RTX promoted clearance of > 75% leukemic cells. Four of six patients receiving 20 mg/m2 RTX retained > or = 50% CD20, and additional RTX infusions promoted further cell clearance. However, four of six patients receiving 60 mg/m2 had CD20 levels < 20% baseline 2 days after initial infusions, and additional RTX infusions were less effective, presumably due to epitope loss. Our results suggest that when a threshold RTX dose is exceeded, recrudesced RTX-opsonized cells are not cleared, due to saturation of the mononuclear phagocytic system, but instead are shaved of RTX-CD20 complexes by acceptor cells.

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2006-10-01,"Although chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains an incurable disease with standard chemotherapy, the appropriate role and timing of transplantation are unclear. In this analysis, we report the outcomes of 46 patients with advanced CLL who underwent nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST) from HLA-matched unrelated (67%) or related (33%) donors. Fludarabine (30 mg/m2 x 4) and low-dose intravenous busulfan (0.8 mg/kg/day x 4) were used for conditioning. The 2-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates in this refractory patient population were 54% and 34%, respectively, with a median follow-up of 20 months. The primary cause of treatment failure was relapse, with a 2-year cumulative incidence of 48%. High hematopoietic donor chimerism > or = 75% at day +30 was a significant predictor of 2-year PFS (47% vs 11%; P = .03). In multivariate analysis, chemotherapy-refractory disease at transplantation was associated with a 3.2-fold risk of progression (P = .01) and a 4.6-fold risk of death (P = .02). Increasing number of previous therapies and increasing bone marrow involvement were also associated with decreased PFS and OS.

Alemtuzumab in CLL and other lymphoid neoplasms.,Cancer investigation,Cancer Invest.,2006-11-01,"The recent success of monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of various hematological and nonhematological cancers is the result of several decades of research in immune therapy of cancer. The identification of cancer-specific surface markers has led to the development of numerous monoclonal antibodies directed at these antigens, which have been associated with variable success in treating patients with different malignancies. Alemtuzumab, one such monoclonal antibody, is a humanized antibody directed against CD52. The target antigen is a small glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoprotein that is highly expressed on normal T- and B-lymphocytes and on a large proportion of malignant lymphoid cells, but not on hematopoietic progenitor cells. A number of clinical trials have demonstrated the clinical activity of alemtuzumab in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), T-cell malignancies such as T-prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), and have examined its role as an immunosuppressive agent in transplantation and for the treatment of autoimmune disorders.

Heterogeneous CD52 expression among hematologic neoplasms: implications for the use of alemtuzumab (CAMPATH-1H).,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2006-12-01,"CD52 is a GPI-linked glycoprotein expressed by B cells, T cells, monocytes, and macrophages. The humanized monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab (CAMPATH-1H) is specific for CD52 and is Food and Drug Administration - approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The utility of CAMPATH in the treatment of other hematologic neoplasms has been explored; however, a comprehensive survey of CD52 expression among a broad spectrum of WHO-defined tumor types has not been completed. We evaluated 294 hematologic neoplasms for the presence of CD52 using standard immunohistochemical techniques on paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens fixed with formalin, B-Plus, Zenker's acetic acid, or B5-formalin. The vast majority of low-grade B cell lymphoproliferative disorders (CLL/small lymphocytic leukemia, follicular lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas) express CD52. In addition, we found that the majority of precursor B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphomas express this antigen. In contrast, there is surprising heterogeneity in CD52 expression among more aggressive B cell lymphomas, with 25% of cases of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma demonstrating no detectable CD52.

Inhibition of CXCR4 with the novel RCP168 peptide overcomes stroma-mediated chemoresistance in chronic and acute leukemias.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2006-12-01,"The chemokine receptor CXCR4 mediates the migration of hematopoietic cells to the stroma-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha)-producing bone marrow microenvironment. Using peptide-based CXCR4 inhibitors derived from the chemokine viral macrophage inflammatory protein II, we tested the hypothesis that the inhibition of CXCR4 increases sensitivity to chemotherapy by interfering with stromal/leukemia cell interactions. First, leukemic cells expressing varying amounts of surface CXCR4 were examined for their chemotactic response to SDF-1alpha or stromal cells, alone or in the presence of different CXCR4 inhibitors. Results showed that the polypeptide RCP168 had the strongest antagonistic effect on the SDF-1alpha- or stromal cell-induced chemotaxis of leukemic cells. Furthermore, RCP168 blocked the binding of anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody 12G5 to surface CXCR4 in a concentration-dependent manner and inhibited SDF-1alpha-induced AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. Finally, RCP168 significantly enhanced chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in stroma-cocultured Jurkat, primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and in a subset of acute myelogenous leukemia cells harboring Flt3 mutation. Equivalent results were obtained with the small-molecule CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3465. Our data therefore suggest that the SDF-1alpha/CXCR4 interaction contributes to the resistance of leukemia cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis.

In addition, ZAP-70 and Bcl-2 family proteins have been explored as predictors of outcome. We prospectively evaluated the prognostic significance of a comprehensive panel of laboratory factors on both response and progression-free survival (PFS) using samples and data from 235 patients enrolled onto a therapeutic trial.

Clin. Oncol.,2007-02-05,"The combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide is an effective regimen for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, it may be accompanied by increased toxicity compared with fludarabine alone. E2997 is a phase III randomized Intergroup trial comparing fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC arm) versus fludarabine (F arm) alone in patients receiving their first chemotherapy regimen for CLL. Symptomatic, previously untreated patients with CLL were randomly assigned to receive either fludarabine 25 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) days 1 through 5 or cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 IV day 1 and fludarabine 20 mg/m2 IV days 1 through 5. These cycles were repeated every 28 days for a maximum of six cycles. A total of 278 patients were randomly assigned in this Intergroup study. Treatment with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide was associated with a significantly higher complete response (CR) rate (23.4% v 4.6%; P < .001) and a higher overall response (OR) rate (74.3% v 59.5%, P = .013) than treatment with fludarabine as a single agent.

Serum-free light chain-a new biomarker for patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,Transl Res,2007-04-01,"New nephelometric immunoassays specific for free immunoglobulin light chains (FLCs) improve detection of monoclonal proteins (M-protein). Initial studies with FLC have focused on multiple myeloma and amyloidosis. The goal of this study was to evaluate the frequency of monoclonal serum FLC in patients with other B-cell malignancies. Frozen sera from 226 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were tested for M-protein by the serum FLC assay and compared with standard protein electrophoresis (PEL) and immunofixation (IF). Overall, 24% (54/226) of samples had a detectable M-protein with 63% of these (34/54) FLC-positive. In 35% (19/54), the M-protein was only detectable by FLC analysis. Of the 208 NHL patients, 22% (46/208) had a detectable M-protein. Also, 13% (27/208) were positive for FLC and 16% (33/208) had a detectable M-protein by PEL/IF. Twenty-eighty percent (13/46) of NHL patients with M-proteins were detectable only by FLC analysis. Within NHL, the highest incidences of FLC presence were in patients with mantle cell (36%) and small lymphocytic (24%). Among CLL patients, 44% had an M-protein with 39% detected by FLC and 11% detected by PEL/IF. Notably, in 6 of 8 CLL patients, the M-protein was only detectable by the FLC method. Serum FLC can be detected in a substantial fraction of patients with NHL/CLL, and the FLC technique improves detection of M-proteins when combined with standard PEL/IF.

Using smudge cells on routine blood smears to predict clinical outcome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a universally available prognostic test.,Mayo Clinic proceedings,Mayo Clin. Proc.,2007-04-01,"Recently developed prognostic tests in early Rai and Binet stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) require considerable technologic expertise and are not available worldwide. Smudge cells are CLL cells ruptured during smear preparation. We hypothesized that smudge cell formation is inversely correlated with expression of vimentin, a cytoskeletal protein and prognostic marker, and that the percentage of smudge cells would predict prognosis in CLL. We reviewed the blood smears of 75 patients with previously untreated early and intermediate-stage CLL (Rai stage 0-II) who were seen at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn, between September 1989 and December 2000. A total of 200 lymphocytes and smudge cells were counted on each slide and the results expressed as a percentage of the total lymphocytes (intact and smudged). The median percentage of smudge cells was 27% (range, 4%-72%). The percentage of smudge cells inversely correlated with vimentin expression (r=-0.57; P=.007). The median percentage of smudge cells was higher in patients with the mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain gene than in those with the unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (31% vs 13%; P=.02). Patients with less than 30% smudge cells had a median time from diagnosis to initial treatment of 72.7 months, whereas the median time from diagnosis to initial treatment in patients with 30% or more smudge cells was not reached (P=.001). The percentage of smudge cells as a continuous variable correlated with overall survival (P=.04).

Targeting CD37-positive lymphoid malignancies with a novel engineered small modular immunopharmaceutical.,Blood,Blood,2007-04-17,"CD37 is a lineage-specific B-cell antigen that to date has been neglected as an attractive therapeutic target. To exploit this, novel CD37-specific small modular immunopharmaceuticals (CD37-SMIP) that include variable regions linked to modified human IgG(1) hinge, CH(2), and CH(3) domains were designed. The lead CD37-SMIP molecule induces potent apoptosis in the presence of a cross-linker, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against B-cell leukemia/lymphoma cell lines and primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells superior to therapeutic antibodies used in these diseases. The CD37-SMIP-dependent ADCC function in vitro was mediated by natural killer (NK) cells but not naive or activated monocytes.

Although chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) has dramatically improved response rates in patients with CLL, some CIT regimens are not well tolerated by many patients >or=70 years of age. Sixty-four previously untreated patients with CLL and serum creatinine <1.5 times the upper limit of normal who met National Cancer Institute (NCI) 96-WG criteria for treatment received pentostatin (2 mg/m(2)), cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m(2)), and rituximab (375 mg/m(2)). The authors measured performance status at study entry and used age, weight, and baseline creatinine to calculate creatinine clearance (CrCl). Eighteen of 64 (28%) patients were ages >or=70 years. Although individuals ages >or=70 years were more likely to have delayed treatment cycles (28% vs 7%; P=.03), there were no significant differences in the number of cycles administered, need for dose reductions, or grade 3-4 hematologic, infectious, or other toxicities. No significant differences in overall response rate, complete response rate, or progression-free survival were observed by age. Twenty-five (39%) patients had a CrCl < 70 mL/min (range, 34-67). Although individuals with CrCl < 70 were more likely to require dose reduction (24% vs 5%; P=.05), there were no significant differences in the number of cycles administered or grade 3-4 hematologic, infectious, or other toxicities. No significant difference in overall response rate, complete response rate, or progression-free survival were observed between patients with CrCl >or= 70 mL/min and those with CrCl < 70 mL/min.

Genomics and proteomics in multiple myeloma and Waldenström macroglobulinemia.,Current opinion in hematology,Curr. Opin. Hematol.,2007-07-01,"Multiple myeloma and Waldenström macroglobulinemia are incurable hematologic malignancies with similar clinical phenotypes characterized by over-production of monoclonal immunoglobulins. Translocations into the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus and aneuploidy are nearly universal in multiple myeloma, whereas Waldenström macroglobulinemia generally does not harbor translocations. Deletion of 6q is identified in 50% of patients with Waldenström macroglobulinemia, however. The genetic abnormalities in multiple myeloma and Waldenström macroglobulinemia have implications for disease progression, and the subsequent proteomic expression associated with each disease influences therapeutic decisions. Gene expression profiling in these hematologic malignancies demonstrated distinct differences in mRNA expression patterns. Following profiling, Waldenström macroglobulinemia samples clustered with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and normal B-cell samples. Profiling performed after separation of Waldenström macroglobulinemia samples into populations with plasma cell or B-cell morphology revealed that plasma cell Waldenström macroglobulinemia samples most closely resembled multiple myeloma samples rather than chronic lymphocytic leukemia or normal control samples. Diverse genetic abnormalities have been identified in these hematologic malignancies, although they have similar clinical features. Gene expression profiling has elucidated the impact of genetic abnormalities.

Downregulation of death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Cell,Cell,2007-06-01,"The heritability of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is relatively high; however, no predisposing mutation has been convincingly identified. We show that loss or reduced expression of death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) underlies cases of heritable predisposition to CLL and the majority of sporadic CLL. Epigenetic silencing of DAPK1 by promoter methylation occurs in almost all sporadic CLL cases. Furthermore, we defined a disease haplotype, which segregates with the CLL phenotype in a large family. DAPK1 expression of the CLL allele is downregulated by 75% in germline cells due to increased HOXB7 binding. In the blood cells from affected family members, promoter methylation results in additional loss of DAPK1 expression.

Methylation and silencing of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2007-06-01,"Previous studies in our laboratory have shown the progressive methylation and suppression of the gene encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTPRO, in the livers of rats fed a methyl-deficient diet that induces hepatocarcinogenesis. Subsequently, we observed the methylation of PTPRO in primary human lung tumors and also showed its potential tumor suppressor characteristics. The present study was undertaken to investigate whether the truncated form of PTPRO (PTPROt), specifically expressed in naïve B lymphocytes, was also methylated and suppressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a disease generally affecting B lymphocytes. Initial screening showed that 60% of the 52 CLL samples analyzed using methylation-specific PCR assay were methylated compared with B lymphocytes from normal individuals, which were not methylated. The expression of PTPROt, as measured by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR, inversely correlated with methylation in the few samples tested. Analysis of additional samples (n = 50) by combined bisulfite restriction analysis showed that the PTPRO CpG island was methylated in 82% of patients with CLL compared with B lymphocytes from normal individuals. Furthermore, overall expression of PTPRO was reduced in CLL relative to normal lymphocytes.

Triterpenoids display single agent anti-tumor activity in a transgenic mouse model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small B cell lymphoma.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2007-06-27,"The synthetic triterpenoid 2-Cyano-3,12-Dioxooleana-1,9-Dien-28-Oic Acid (CDDO) and derivatives display anti-tumor activity against a variety of cultured tumor cell lines and in mouse xenografts. In this report, we have studied the effects of CDDO and its imidazolide derivative (CDDO-Im) on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), using patients' CLL cells and a mouse model of CLL and small B cell lymphoma (SBL). CDDO and CDDO-Im efficiently induced apoptosis of malignant human and mouse B-cells ex vivo, although CDDO-Im was over 10-fold more potent than CDDO. Treating mice with CLL/SBL with liposome-formulated CDDO or CDDO-Im resulted in significant reductions of B cells in blood, spleen and lung. CDDO-Im was shown to be more potent than CDDO, while treatment with empty liposomes had no impact on disease. CDDO-Im treatment initially resulted in an increase of circulating B cells, which correlates with a reduction in resident lymphocytes in spleen, and lungs, suggesting that CDDO-Im induces mobilization of tumor cells from lymphoid organs and infiltrated tissues into the circulation. Analysis of blood cells recovered from treated mice also showed that CDDO-Im is a potent inducer of tumor cells death in vivo. Furthermore, CDDO-Im efficiently eradicated mouse CLL/SBL cells but had little effect on the viability of normal B and T cells in vivo.

"Overexpression of the CXCR5 chemokine receptor, and its ligand, CXCL13 in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",Blood,Blood,2007-07-25,"CXCL13 is a homeostatic chemokine for lymphocyte homing and positioning within follicles of secondary lymphoid tissues, acting through its cognate receptor, CXCR5. Moreover, the CXCR5-CXCL13 axis plays a unique role in trafficking and homing of B1 cells. Here, we report that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells express high levels of functional CXCR5. CXCR5 expression levels were similar on CLL B cells and normal CD5+ B cells, and higher compared with normal CD5- B cells, follicular B-helper T cells (T(FH) cells), or neoplastic B cells from other B-cell neoplasias. Stimulation of CLL cells with CXCL13 induces actin polymerization, CXCR5 endocytosis, chemotaxis, and prolonged activation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinases. Anti-CXCR5 antibodies, pertussis toxin, and wortmannin inhibited chemotaxis to CXCL13, demonstrating the importance of Gi proteins and PI3 kinases for CXCR5 signaling. Moreover, CLL patients had significantly higher CXCL13 serum levels than volunteers, and CXCL13 levels correlated with beta2 microglobulin.

Identification and validation of biomarkers of IgV(H) mutation status in chronic lymphocytic leukemia using microfluidics quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction technology.,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,J Mol Diagn,2007-08-09,"To develop a model incorporating relevant prognostic biomarkers for untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, we re-analyzed the raw data from four published gene expression profiling studies. We selected 88 candidate biomarkers linked to immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IgV(H)) mutation status and produced a reliable and reproducible microfluidics quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction array. We applied this array to a training set of 29 purified samples from previously untreated patients. In an unsupervised analysis, the samples clustered into two groups. Using a cutoff point of 2% homology to the germline IgV(H) sequence, one group contained all 14 IgV(H)-unmutated samples; the other contained all 15 mutated samples. We confirmed the differential expression of 37 of the candidate biomarkers using two-sample t-tests.

FTY720 demonstrates promising preclinical activity for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma.,Blood,Blood,2007-08-29,"FTY720 is an immunosuppressant developed to prevent organ transplant rejection. Recent studies indicate an additional role for FTY720 in inducing cell apoptosis. We demonstrate here that FTY720 mediates toxic effects in cell lines representing different B-cell malignancies and primary B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In contrast to previous reports in T-cell lines, FTY720-induced toxicity in the Raji cell line and primary CLL B cells is independent of activation of caspases or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase processing. Further, pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk failed to rescue these cells from apoptosis mediated by FTY720. FTY720 induced down-regulation of Mcl-1 but not Bcl-2 in CLL B cells. Overexpression of Bcl-2 failed to protect transformed B cells from FTY720-induced apoptosis, suggesting a Bcl-2-independent mechanism.

Rituximab-CD20 complexes are shaved from Z138 mantle cell lymphoma cells in intravenous and subcutaneous SCID mouse models.,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",J. Immunol.,2007-09-01,"Infusion of standard-dose rituximab (RTX) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients promotes rapid complement activation and deposition of C3 fragments on CLL B cells. However, immediately after RTX infusions, there is substantial loss (shaving) of CD20 from circulating malignant cells. Because shaving can compromise efficacies of anticancer immunotherapeutic mAbs, we investigated whether shaving occurs in SCID mouse models. Z138 cells, a B cell line derived from human mantle cell lymphoma, were infused i.v. or s.c. The i.v. model recapitulates findings we previously reported for therapeutic RTX in CLL: i.v. infused RTX rapidly binds to Z138 cells in lungs, and binding is accompanied by deposition of C3 fragments. However, within 1 h targeted cells lose bound RTX and CD20, and these shaved cells are still demonstrable 40 h after RTX infusion. Z138 cells grow in tumors at s.c. injection sites, and infusion of large amounts of RTX (0.50 mg on each of 4 days) leads to considerable loss of CD20 from these cells. Human i.v. Ig blocked shaving, suggesting that FcgammaRI on cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system promote shaving. Examination of frozen tumor sections from treated mice by immunofluorescence revealed large areas of B cells devoid of CD20, with CD20 intact in adjacent areas; it is likely that RTX had opsonized Z138 cells closest to capillaries, and these cells were shaved by monocyte/macrophages.

We conducted an international, web-based survey of patients with CLL using standardized instruments with published population norms to evaluate fatigue and QOL. Co-morbid health conditions were assessed using the Charlson Co-Morbidity Index. Between June and October 2006, 1482 patients with CLL responded to the survey. The physical, social/family, functional, and overall QOL scores of CLL patients were similar to or better than published population norms. In contrast, the emotional well-being scores of CLL patients were dramatically lower than that of both the general population (P < 0.001) and patients with other types of cancer (P < 0.001). QOL scores were lower among individuals with advanced stage disease (all P < 0.05). Factors associated with lower overall QOL on multivariate analysis included older age, greater fatigue, severity of co-morbid health conditions, and current treatment.

Flavopiridol in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Current opinion in oncology,Curr Opin Oncol,2007-11-01,"The synthetic flavone flavopiridol induces apoptosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitro; however, initial studies administering flavopiridol by a 24- to 72-h continuous intravenous infusion demonstrated no clinical activity. This review focuses on a novel dosing regimen that has achieved significant clinical activity in relapsed, poor-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Binding to human plasma proteins reduces free flavopiridol concentration and makes continuous intravenous infusion dosing ineffective. Pharmacokinetic modeling indicated that administering flavopiridol by a 30-min intravenous bolus followed by a 4-h continuous intravenous infusion would achieve serum concentrations necessary to induce in-vivo apoptosis.

We conducted a randomized trial wherein patients being treated with an alemtuzumab-containing regimen received prophylaxis with either valaciclovir 500 mg orally daily or valganciclovir 450 mg orally twice daily. The study design planned to enroll 128 patients, but stopping rules for early termination were met. Forty patients were evaluable. Median age was 58 years (range, 25-83 years); median number of prior therapies was 2 (range, 0-10). Diagnoses included chronic lymphocytic leukemia (29), T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (3), hairy cell leukemia (1), adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) (1), marginal zone leukemia (1), large granular lymphocyte leukemia (2), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (1), and T-cell lymphoma (2). Patients received various alemtuzumab-containing regimens, including single agent (5) or combined with: rituximab (2), pentostatin (6), fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (23), or fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD) (4). Seven of 20 patients enrolled on the valaciclovir arm experienced CMV reactivation. None of the 20 patients randomized to valganciclovir experienced CMV reactivation (P = .004).

Immunoglobulin diversity gene usage predicts unfavorable outcome in a subset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients.,The Journal of clinical investigation,J. Clin. Invest.,2008-01-01,"Survival of patients with B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) can be predicted by analysis of mutations in the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene (IGHV). Patients without mutations (unmutated [UM]) are at greater risk for disease progression and death than patients with mutations (M). Despite this broad prognostic difference, there remains wide intragroup variation in the clinical outcome of UM patients, especially those with low/intermediate Rai risk disease. We evaluated UM B-CLL patients with low/intermediate Rai risk to determine the relationship between IGHV, IGH diversity (IGHD), and IGH joining (IGHJ) gene usage and time to treatment (TTT). Irrespective of IGHV usage, UM patients whose B-CLL cells expressed the IGHD3-3 gene had a significantly shorter TTT than other UM B-CLL patients, and specifically, use of the IGHD3-3 gene in reading frame 2 (RF2) predicted shorter TTT. As expected, Rai risk was the best single prognostic factor for TTT; however, IGHD usage was also a significant variable for TTT. Therefore, both IGHD gene and IGHD RF usage have prognostic relevance in UM B-CLL patients with low/intermediate Rai risk disease. In addition, these data support the concept that antigen-driven selection of specific Ig receptors plays a role in the clinical course of B-CLL.",Journal Article,4403.0,20.0,Survival of patients with B cell chronic lymphocytic B-CLL can be predicted by analysis of mutations in the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene IGHV Patients without mutations unmutated UM are at greater risk for disease progression and death than patients with mutations M Despite this broad prognostic difference there remains wide intragroup variation in the clinical outcome of UM patients especially those with low/intermediate Rai risk disease We evaluated UM B-CLL patients with low/intermediate Rai risk to determine the relationship between IGHV IGH diversity IGHD and IGH joining IGHJ gene usage and time to treatment TTT Irrespective of IGHV usage UM patients whose B-CLL cells expressed the IGHD3-3 gene had a significantly shorter TTT than other UM B-CLL patients and specifically use of the IGHD3-3 gene in reading frame 2 RF2 predicted shorter TTT As expected Rai risk was the best single prognostic factor for TTT however IGHD usage was also a significant variable for TTT Therefore both IGHD gene and IGHD RF usage have prognostic relevance in UM B-CLL patients with low/intermediate Rai risk disease In addition these data support the concept that antigen-driven selection of specific Ig receptors plays a role in the clinical course of B-CLL,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[25, 1, 7, 5, 132, 31, 442, 1193, 132, 552, 122, 40, 783, 20, 65, 1, 138, 4, 3, 2593, 4013, 1260, 1347, 145, 6220, 7, 187, 138, 7216, 5878, 32, 28, 378, 43, 9, 34, 91, 2, 273, 76, 7, 5, 138, 188, 550, 26, 2094, 177, 523, 125, 469, 1019, 56744, 1380, 4, 3, 38, 228, 1, 5878, 7, 1093, 135, 5, 154, 919, 4121, 43, 34, 21, 194, 5878, 132, 552, 7, 5, 154, 919, 4121, 43, 6, 223, 3, 858, 59, 6220, 5221, 3653, 31151, 2, 5221, 10690, 44799, 145, 5015, 2, 98, 6, 24, 10630, 3500, 1, 6220, 5015, 5878, 7, 1310, 132, 552, 37, 570, 3, 34307, 27, 145, 42, 8, 97, 985, 10630, 76, 127, 5878, 132, 552, 7, 2, 1225, 119, 1, 3, 34307, 27, 145, 4, 7299, 5331, 18, 56745, 783, 985, 10630, 22, 1336, 4121, 43, 10, 3, 824, 226, 177, 161, 9, 10630, 137, 31151, 5015, 10, 120, 8, 93, 1347, 9, 10630, 673, 110, 31151, 145, 2, 31151, 7279, 5015, 47, 177, 2088, 4, 5878, 132, 552, 7, 5, 154, 919, 4121, 43, 34, 4, 352, 46, 74, 538, 3, 2545, 17, 448, 1621, 881, 1, 112, 4200, 1186, 1698, 8, 200, 4, 3, 38, 906, 1, 132, 552]",1265.0,18064298,201

We conducted a phase I-II trial of oxaliplatin, fludarabine, cytarabine, and rituximab (OFAR) in these diseases. The OFAR regimen consisted of increasing doses of oxaliplatin (17.5, 20, or 25 mg/m(2)/d) on days 1 to 4 (phase I), fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) on days 2 to 3, cytarabine 1 g/m(2) on days 2 to 3, rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on day 3 of cycle 1 and day 1 of subsequent cycles, and pegfilgrastim 6 mg on day 6, every 4 weeks for a maximum of six courses. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any nonhematologic, treatment-related toxicity >/= grade 3. Fifty patients were treated (20 patients had RS, and 30 had CLL). The highest tolerated oxaliplatin dose was 25 mg/m(2), which was the highest dose tested. DLT was not observed. Pharmacodynamic analyses demonstrated enhanced leukemia cell killing by oxaliplatin in the presence of fludarabine and cytarabine. The overall response rates were 50% in RS and 33% in fludarabine-refractory CLL. The overall response rate in 14 patients with age >/= 70 years was 50%. Responses were achieved in seven (35%) of 20 patients with 17p deletion, two (29%) of seven patients with 11q deletion, all four patients with trisomy 12, and two (40%) of five patients with 13q deletion.

Controversies in the front-line management of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2008-01-11,"Once considered a simple homogeneous disease, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is now recognized to be a heterogeneous lymphoid malignancy with patients classified into low, intermediate, and high-risk categories based on traditional and novel prognostic factors. Purine nucleoside analogues have been the standard first-line approach for over a decade. The recognition of synergistic activity between purine analogues, alkylating agents, and monoclonal antibodies has allowed the introduction of many new active combination therapies for treatment of this disease. The paucity of randomized studies determining the efficacy and tolerability of these new regimens, however, has made therapy selection for individual patients complex and cumbersome. At the present time, it remains unclear whether patients with aggressive disease based on molecular features should receive early or alternative treatment strategies. In this review, we summarize the data on combination chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy in CLL and propose several key factors that should be taken into consideration when deciding on an initial treatment strategy.

Flavopiridol causes early mitochondrial damage in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells with impaired oxygen consumption and mobilization of intracellular calcium.,Blood,Blood,2008-01-11,"Effective administration of flavopiridol in advanced-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is often associated with early biochemical evidence of tumor cell lysis. Previous work using other cell types showed that flavopiridol impacts mitochondria, and in CLL cells flavopiridol down-regulates the mitochondrial protein Mcl-1. We therefore investigated mitochondrial structure and function in flavopiridol-treated CLL patient cells and in the lymphoblastic cell line 697 using concentrations and times at which tumor lysis is observed in treated patients. Mitochondrial membrane depolarization was detected in flavopiridol-treated CLL cells by 6 hours, well before the onset of cell death. Flavopiridol-induced mitochondrial depolarization was not blocked by caspase inhibitors or by the calcium chelator EGTA, but was reduced by Bcl-2 overexpression. Intracellular calcium mobilization was noted at early time points using fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, electron paramagnetic resonance oximetry showed a gradual but significant reduction in cellular oxygen consumption rate by 6 hours, corresponding with ultrastructural mitochondrial damage detected by electron microscopy. These observations suggest that in CLL and 697 cells, flavopiridol mediates its cytotoxic effects via induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition and changes in intracellular calcium.",Journal Article,4393.0,47.0,Effective administration of flavopiridol in advanced-stage chronic lymphocytic CLL is often associated with early biochemical evidence of tumor cell lysis Previous work using other cell types showed that flavopiridol impacts mitochondria and in CLL cells flavopiridol down-regulates the mitochondrial protein Mcl-1 We therefore investigated mitochondrial structure and function in flavopiridol-treated CLL patient cells and in the lymphoblastic cell line 697 using concentrations and times at which tumor lysis is observed in treated patients Mitochondrial membrane depolarization was detected in flavopiridol-treated CLL cells by 6 hours well before the onset of cell death Flavopiridol-induced mitochondrial depolarization was not blocked by caspase inhibitors or by the calcium chelator EGTA but was reduced by Bcl-2 overexpression Intracellular calcium mobilization was noted at early time points using fluorescence microscopy Furthermore electron paramagnetic resonance oximetry showed a gradual but significant reduction in cellular oxygen consumption rate by 6 hours corresponding with ultrastructural mitochondrial damage detected by electron microscopy These observations suggest that in CLL and 697 cells flavopiridol mediates its cytotoxic effects via induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition and changes in intracellular calcium,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[323, 634, 1, 3030, 4, 131, 82, 442, 1193, 552, 16, 629, 41, 5, 191, 1487, 241, 1, 30, 31, 4783, 698, 1357, 75, 127, 31, 630, 224, 17, 3030, 4719, 5443, 2, 4, 552, 37, 3030, 1328, 2468, 3, 2019, 178, 1308, 14, 21, 673, 565, 2019, 2772, 2, 343, 4, 3030, 73, 552, 69, 37, 2, 4, 3, 1275, 31, 328, 11989, 75, 1003, 2, 1072, 28, 92, 30, 4783, 16, 164, 4, 73, 7, 2019, 1905, 14809, 10, 530, 4, 3030, 73, 552, 37, 20, 49, 1459, 149, 348, 3, 1707, 1, 31, 273, 3030, 277, 2019, 14809, 10, 44, 2582, 20, 1469, 222, 15, 20, 3, 3299, 17613, 42956, 84, 10, 405, 20, 1044, 18, 851, 2087, 3299, 4030, 10, 1051, 28, 191, 98, 862, 75, 1591, 3804, 798, 4560, 20995, 1535, 22167, 224, 8, 11268, 84, 93, 628, 4, 763, 2848, 2421, 116, 20, 49, 1459, 1734, 5, 13755, 2019, 1350, 530, 20, 4560, 3804, 46, 2172, 309, 17, 4, 552, 2, 11989, 37, 3030, 3961, 211, 759, 176, 847, 504, 1, 3, 2019, 4757, 1970, 2, 400, 4, 2087, 3299]",1354.0,18192508,488

"Comorbid conditions and survival in unselected, newly diagnosed patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2008-01-01,"Little is known about the spectrum or frequency of comorbidities in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We investigated the prevalence and prognostic implications of comorbidities in patients with newly diagnosed CLL. Local/non-referred patients with CLL evaluated by a hematologist at Mayo Clinic within 1 year of diagnosis were eligible for this retrospective review. Of 1195 individuals evaluated for newly-diagnosed CLL between 1995 and 2006, 373 (31%) were local/non-referred. At diagnosis, 89% of these patients had one or more comorbidities, and 46% had at least one major comorbidity. Twenty-six percent of patients failed to meet NCI working group guidelines to participate in a clinical trial.

Interactions between bortezomib and romidepsin and belinostat in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2008-01-01,"The goal of this study was to characterize interactions between the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACI) romidepsin or belinostat in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. Primary and cultured (JVM-3 and MEC-2) CLL cells were exposed to agents alone or in combination, after which cell death was determined by 7-aminoactinomycin D staining/flow cytometry. Acetylation of target proteins, activation of caspase cascades, and expression of apoptosis-regulatory proteins were monitored by Western blot analysis. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity was determined by luciferase reporter assay. Cells were transiently transfected with wild-type and acetylation site-mutated (inactive) RelA(p65) (e.g., K221R, K310R, or K281/221/310R) and assessed for HDACI sensitivity. Combined exposure to very low concentrations of romidepsin or belinostat (i.e., low nanomolar and submicromolar, respectively) in combination with low nanomolar concentrations of bortezomib synergistically induced cell death in primary and cultured CLL cells. These events were likely associated with prevention of HDACI-mediated RelA acetylation and NF-kappaB activation by bortezomib, down-regulation of antiapoptotic proteins (i.e., Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and XIAP), as well as up-regulation of the proapoptotic protein Bim, resulting in activation of caspase cascade. Finally, CLL cells transfected with inactive RelA displayed a significant increase in HDACI lethality.

A novel Raji-Burkitt's lymphoma model for preclinical and mechanistic evaluation of CD52-targeted immunotherapeutic agents.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2008-01-01,"To date, efforts to study CD52-targeted therapies, such as alemtuzumab, have been limited due to the lack of stable CD52 expressing transformed B-cell lines and animal models. We describe generation and utilization of cell lines that stably express CD52 both in vitro and in vivo. By limiting dilution, we have established several clones of Raji-Burkitt's lymphoma cell line that express surface CD52. Immunophenotype and cytogenetic characterization of these clones was done. In vivo usefulness of the CD52(high) cell line to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of CD52-directed antibody was investigated using a SCID mouse xenograft model. Stable expression of CD52 was confirmed in cells cultured in vitro up to 52 weeks of continuous growth. The functional integrity of the expressed CD52 molecule was shown using alemtuzumab, which induced cytotoxic effects in vitro in the CD52(high) but not the CD52(low) clone. Compared with control antibody, alemtuzumab treatment in CD52(high) inoculated mice resulted in significantly increased median survival. Comparable levels of CD52-targeted direct cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and anti-CD52 immunoliposome-mediated delivery of synthetic oligodeoxyribo nucleotides in CD52(high) clone and primary B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells implicated potential in vivo application of this model for evaluation of CD52-targeted antibody and immunoliposomes encapsulating therapeutic agents. These results show the in vitro utility of the cloned Raji cell lines that stably express high levels CD52.

Enzymatic activity of circulating proteasomes correlates with clinical behavior in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2008-03-01,"The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many hematologic malignancies. The authors measured proteasome peptidase activity levels in plasma samples from 225 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and correlated the results with clinical behavior. By using fluorogenic kinetic assays, the enzymatic activity levels of 3 proteasomes were measured: chymotrypsin-like (Ch-L), trypsin-like (Tr-L), and caspase-like (Cas-L). All activity levels were significantly higher in patients who had CLL compared with the levels in a control group of healthy volunteers (P<.001). Rai stage was correlated with Ch-L activity (P<.001) but not with Cas-L or Tr-L activity. Levels of beta2 microglobulin (B2M) were correlated with Ch-L activity (correlation coefficient [R]=0.4; P<.001) and with Cas-L activity (R=0.25; P=.001) but not with Tr-L activity. Cas-L activity as a continuous variable was a strong predictor of survival. Ch-L and Cas-L activity levels as categorical variables both were strong predictors of survival; Cas-L activity was independent of B2M level but not of immunoglobulin variable heavy chain gene (IgVH) mutation status. However, the combination of elevated B2M levels (>3.2 mg/L) and Cas-L activity (>1.32 pmoL/second/mL plasma) was associated with significantly shorter survival independent of IgVH mutation status.

Retrospective cohort of childhood cancer survivors. Twenty-six academic institutions treating childhood cancer. Two thousand six hundred forty-five survivors of childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia, central nervous system tumors, Hodgkin lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcomas, or bone tumors diagnosed before age 21, surviving at least 5 years from diagnosis, and a 500-sibling comparison group. Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Significant differences were found between survivors and siblings on the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (40.8 vs 42.0, P < 0.02), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (6.1 vs 5.5, P < 0.004), and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (6.2 vs 5.4, P < 0.001). Nineteen percent of survivors were in the most fatigued range, 16.7% reported disrupted sleep, and 14% increased daytime sleepiness.

"Use of IGHV3-21 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia is associated with high-risk disease and reflects antigen-driven, post-germinal center leukemogenic selection.",Blood,Blood,2008-03-07,"We examined the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells of 2457 patients evaluated by the CLL Research Consortium (CRC) and found that 63 (2.6%) expressed immunoglobulin (Ig) encoded by the Ig heavy-chain-variable-region gene (IGHV), IGHV3-21. We identified the amino acid sequence DANGMDV (motif-1) or DPSFYSSSWTLFDY (motif-2) in the Ig heavy-chain (IgH) third complementarity-determining region (HCDR3) of IgH, respectively, used by 25 or 3 cases. The IgH with HCDR3 motif-1 or motif-2, respectively, was paired with Ig light chains (IgL) encoded by IGLV3-21 or IGKV3-20, suggesting that these Ig had been selected for binding to conventional antigen(s). Cases that had HCDR3 motif-1 had a median time from diagnosis to initial therapy comparable with that of cases without a defined HCDR3 motif, as did cases that used mutated IGHV3-21 (n = 27) versus unmutated IGHV3-21 (n = 30). Of 7 examined cases that used Ig encoded by IGHV3-21/IGLV3-21, we found that 5 had a functionally rearranged IGKV allele that apparently had incurred antigendriven somatic mutations and subsequent rearrangement with KDE. This study reveals that CLL cells expressing IGHV3-21/IGLV3-21 most likely were derived from B cells that had experienced somatic mutation and germinal-center maturation in an apparent antigen-driven immune response before undergoing Ig-receptor editing and after germinal-center leukemogenic selection.",Journal Article,4337.0,50.0,We examined the chronic lymphocytic CLL cells of 2457 patients evaluated by the CLL Research Consortium CRC and found that 63 2.6 expressed immunoglobulin Ig encoded by the Ig heavy-chain-variable-region gene IGHV IGHV3-21 We identified the amino acid sequence DANGMDV motif-1 or DPSFYSSSWTLFDY motif-2 in the Ig heavy-chain IgH third complementarity-determining region HCDR3 of IgH respectively used by 25 or 3 cases The IgH with HCDR3 motif-1 or motif-2 respectively was paired with Ig light chains IgL encoded by IGLV3-21 or IGKV3-20 suggesting that these Ig had been selected for binding to conventional antigen s Cases that had HCDR3 motif-1 had a median time from diagnosis to initial therapy comparable with that of cases without a defined HCDR3 motif as did cases that used mutated IGHV3-21 n 27 versus unmutated IGHV3-21 n 30 Of 7 examined cases that used Ig encoded by IGHV3-21/IGLV3-21 we found that 5 had a functionally rearranged IGKV allele that apparently had incurred antigendriven somatic mutations and subsequent rearrangement with KDE This study reveals that CLL cells expressing IGHV3-21/IGLV3-21 most likely were derived from B cells that had experienced somatic mutation and germinal-center maturation in an apparent antigen-driven immune response before undergoing Ig-receptor editing and after germinal-center leukemogenic selection,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 409, 3, 442, 1193, 552, 37, 1, 56915, 7, 194, 20, 3, 552, 389, 2404, 590, 2, 204, 17, 676, 18, 49, 570, 2593, 4200, 4587, 20, 3, 4200, 4013, 1260, 1347, 1053, 145, 6220, 31242, 239, 21, 108, 3, 3078, 971, 1532, 56916, 5298, 14, 15, 56917, 5298, 18, 4, 3, 4200, 4013, 1260, 5221, 1282, 17673, 2196, 1053, 23615, 1, 5221, 106, 95, 20, 243, 15, 27, 140, 3, 5221, 5, 23615, 5298, 14, 15, 5298, 18, 106, 10, 2355, 5, 4200, 1691, 7802, 17659, 4587, 20, 34308, 239, 15, 34306, 179, 802, 17, 46, 4200, 42, 85, 715, 9, 791, 6, 809, 448, 695, 140, 17, 42, 23615, 5298, 14, 42, 8, 52, 98, 29, 147, 6, 388, 36, 1279, 5, 17, 1, 140, 187, 8, 395, 23615, 5298, 22, 205, 140, 17, 95, 1185, 31242, 239, 78, 428, 185, 7216, 31242, 239, 78, 201, 1, 67, 409, 140, 17, 95, 4200, 4587, 20, 31242, 239, 34308, 239, 21, 204, 17, 33, 42, 8, 3772, 3201, 38509, 1254, 17, 6343, 42, 11172, 56918, 1119, 138, 2, 706, 2675, 5, 45049, 26, 45, 4054, 17, 552, 37, 1046, 31242, 239, 34308, 239, 96, 322, 11, 526, 29, 132, 37, 17, 42, 592, 1119, 258, 2, 6312, 574, 4537, 4, 35, 2235, 448, 1621, 250, 51, 348, 479, 4200, 153, 6120, 2, 50, 6312, 574, 13519, 881]",1356.0,18326815,487

The overall response rate was 95%, with complete remission in 72%, nodular partial remission in 10%, partial remission due to cytopenia in 7%, and partial remission due to residual disease in 6%. Two patients (< 1%) died within 3 months of starting therapy. Six-year overall and failure-free survival were 77% and 51%, respectively. Median time to progression was 80 months. Pretreatment characteristics independently associated with inferior response were age 70 years or older, beta2-microglobulin twice the upper limit of normal (2N) or more, white cell count 150 x 10(9)/L or more, abnormal chromosome 17, and lactate dehydrogenase 2N or more.

"The antileukemia activity of a human anti-CD40 antagonist antibody, HCD122, on human chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.",Blood,Blood,2008-05-22,"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is a lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by the surface expression of CD20, CD5 antigens, as well as the receptor CD40. Activation of CD40 by its ligand (CD40L) induces proliferation and rescues the cells from spontaneous and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. CD40 activation also induces secretion of cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, IL-8, and GM-CSF, which are involved in tumor cell survival, migration, and interaction with cells in the tumor microenvironment. Here we demonstrate that in primary B-CLL tumor cells, the novel antagonist anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody, HCD122, inhibits CD40L-induced activation of signaling pathways, proliferation and survival, and secretion of cytokines. Furthermore, HCD122 is also a potent mediator of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), lysing B-CLL cells more efficiently than rituximab in vitro, despite a significantly higher number of cell surface CD20 binding sites compared with CD40. Unlike rituximab, however, HCD122 (formerly CHIR-12.12) does not internalize upon binding to the cells.

Autoimmune pancreatitis and concurrent small lymphocytic lymphoma: not just a coincidence?,Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,J. Gastrointest. Surg.,2008-05-28,"A 76-year-old gentleman presented with painless jaundice, weight loss, and anorexia. Computed tomography imaging revealed fullness of the pancreatic head and multiple enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Cholangiogram revealed a distal common bile duct stricture. Due to concerns of malignancy, the patient underwent operative exploration. Several enlarged lymph nodes in the aortocaval region and a firm hard mass in the pancreatic head were found. Frozen section from one of the lymph nodes was suspicious for low-grade lymphoma. A pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. Histologic analysis of the pancreatic head revealed a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with stromal fibrosis consistent with autoimmune pancreatitis. The retroperitoneal lymph nodes were involved by small lymphocytic lymphoma. Autoimmune pancreatitis is the most common benign diagnosis after pancreatic resection for presumed malignancy. It has a well-documented association with autoimmune conditions, such as Sjögren's syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and sclerosing cholangitis.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia T cells show impaired immunological synapse formation that can be reversed with an immunomodulating drug.,The Journal of clinical investigation,J. Clin.

Here we demonstrate that impaired actin polymerization results in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) exhibiting defective immunological synapse formation with APCs. Although this synapse dysfunction was in part a result of the CLL cells having poor APC function, defective actin polymerization was also identified in T cells from patients with CLL. We further demonstrate that, following contact with CLL cells, defects in immune synapse formation were induced in healthy allogeneic T cells. This required direct contact and was inhibited by blocking adhesion molecules on CLL B cells. In T cells from patients with CLL and in T cells from healthy individuals that had been in contact with CLL cells, recruitment of key regulatory proteins to the immune synapse was inhibited. Treatment of autologous T cells and CLL cells with the immunomodulating drug lenalidomide resulted in improved synapse formation.

"Gossypol, a BH3 mimetic, induces apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.",Blood,Blood,2008-06-19,"Gossypol, a cottonseed extract derivative, acts as a BH3-mimetic, binding to the BH3 pocket of antiapoptotic proteins and displacing pro-death partners to induce apoptosis. However, knowledge on the molecular underpinnings of its downstream effects is limited. Since chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells express high levels of antiapoptotic proteins that act as a survival mechanism for these replicationally quiescent lymphocytes, we investigated whether gossypol induces apoptosis in these cells and what mechanism underlies gossypol-mediated cytotoxicity. Gossypol induced cell death in a concentration- and time-dependent manner; 24-hour incubation with 30 microM gossypol resulted in 50% cell death (median; range, 10%-80%; n = 47) that was not abrogated by pan-specific caspase inhibitor. Starting at 4 hours, the mitochondrial outer membrane was significantly permeabilized (median, 77%; range, 54%-93%; n = 15). Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabiliztaion (MOMP) was concurrent with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS); however, antioxidants did not abrogate gossypol-induced cell death. Mitochondrial membrane permeabilization was also associated with loss of intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), activation of BAX, and release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), which was translocated to the nucleus.

Effective elimination of fludarabine-resistant CLL cells by PEITC through a redox-mediated mechanism.,Blood,Blood,2008-06-23,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common adult leukemia, and resistance to fludarabine-based therapies is a major challenge in CLL treatment. Because CLL cells are known to have elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), we aimed to test a novel ROS-mediated strategy to eliminate fludarabine-resistant CLL cells based on this redox alteration. Using primary CLL cells and normal lymphocytes from patients (n = 58) and healthy subjects (n = 12), we showed that both fludarabine-resistant and -sensitive CLL cells were highly sensitive to beta-phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) with mean IC(50) values of 5.4 microM and 5.1 microM, respectively. Normal lymphocytes were significantly less sensitive to PEITC (IC(50) = 27 microM, P < .001). CLL cells exhibited intrinsically higher ROS level and lower cellular glutathione, which were shown to be the critical determinants of CLL sensitivity to PEITC. Exposure of CLL cells to PEITC induced severe glutathione depletion, ROS accumulation, and oxidation of mitochondrial cardiolipin leading to massive cell death. Such ROS stress also caused deglutathionylation of MCL1, followed by a rapid degradation of this cell survival molecule.

Predictive value of blood and bone marrow flow cytometry in B-cell lymphoma classification: comparative analysis of flow cytometry and tissue biopsy in 252 patients.,Mayo Clinic proceedings,Mayo Clin. Proc.,2008-07-01,"To study the effectiveness of peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCIP) in predicting the histologic B-cell lymphoma type. We studied the FCIP results and tissue histopathology from 252 patients with B-cell lymphoma seen at Mayo Clinic's site in Rochester, MN, between January 1, 1997, and January 1, 2004, who had positive results on PB, bone marrow, or body fluid FCIP and a corresponding diagnostic tissue biopsy specimen. Most of the B-cell lymphomas studied were low grade, with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma being most common. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping histogram analysis was more informative than tabulated percentage antigen positivity; surface immunoglobulin and CD20 staining intensity, CD5 and CD23 positivity, CD10 positivity, and the coexpression of CD11c/CD22 and CD103 were the most pertinent markers. Using these FCIP parameters and strict immunophenotypic definitions for CLL, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and hairy cell leukemia, we obtained greater than 95% specificity for each diagnosis. However, we encountered the following exceptions to standard paradigms of B-cell lymphoma-associated FCIP: (1) CD5 expression by disorders distinct from CLL and MCL, (2) lack of uniform CD5 positivity in some CLL and MCL cases, (3) absence of CD10 in approximately 50% of follicular lymphomas, and (4) expression of CD103 by occasional marginal zone lymphomas. Stringent interpretation of PB and bone marrow FCIP results enables identification of certain B-cell lymphoma types. However, the observed exceptions to accepted immunophenotypic paradigms highlight the occasional phenotypic overlap among diseases and emphasize that a systematic approach to FCIP interpretations is key to providing clinically useful diagnostic information.",Comparative Study,4221.0,,To study the effectiveness of peripheral blood PB and marrow flow cytometric immunophenotyping FCIP in predicting the histologic B-cell type We studied the FCIP results and tissue histopathology from 252 patients with B-cell seen at Mayo Clinic 's site in Rochester MN between January 1 1997 and January 1 2004 who had positive results on PB marrow or body fluid FCIP and a corresponding diagnostic tissue biopsy specimen Most of the B-cell lymphomas studied were low grade with chronic lymphocytic CLL /small lymphocytic being most common Flow cytometric immunophenotyping histogram analysis was more informative than tabulated percentage antigen positivity surface immunoglobulin and CD20 staining intensity CD5 and CD23 positivity CD10 positivity and the coexpression of CD11c/CD22 and CD103 were the most pertinent markers Using these FCIP parameters and strict immunophenotypic definitions for CLL mantle cell MCL and hairy cell we obtained greater than 95 specificity for each diagnosis However we encountered the following exceptions to standard paradigms of B-cell lymphoma-associated FCIP 1 CD5 expression by disorders distinct from CLL and MCL 2 lack of uniform CD5 positivity in some CLL and MCL cases 3 absence of CD10 in approximately 50 of follicular lymphomas and 4 expression of CD103 by occasional marginal zone lymphomas Stringent interpretation of PB and marrow FCIP results enables identification of certain B-cell types However the observed exceptions to accepted immunophenotypic paradigms highlight the occasional phenotypic overlap among diseases and emphasize that a systematic approach to FCIP interpretations is key to providing clinically useful diagnostic information,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 45, 3, 1236, 1, 672, 315, 3767, 2, 581, 1412, 6226, 9416, 22492, 4, 1434, 3, 884, 132, 31, 267, 21, 656, 3, 22492, 99, 2, 246, 3831, 29, 6951, 7, 5, 132, 31, 527, 28, 2486, 1188, 292, 606, 4, 5801, 4691, 59, 1024, 14, 2341, 2, 1024, 14, 1131, 54, 42, 109, 99, 23, 3767, 581, 15, 642, 2357, 22492, 2, 8, 1734, 752, 246, 411, 2360, 96, 1, 3, 132, 31, 1557, 656, 11, 154, 88, 5, 442, 1193, 552, 302, 1193, 486, 96, 186, 1412, 6226, 9416, 8261, 65, 10, 80, 4189, 76, 9903, 1150, 448, 1887, 1255, 2593, 2, 2198, 1029, 837, 6349, 2, 9937, 1887, 6289, 1887, 2, 3, 7588, 1, 12513, 7599, 2, 13856, 11, 3, 96, 5799, 525, 75, 46, 22492, 1038, 2, 8043, 6599, 3833, 9, 552, 2757, 31, 1308, 2, 7152, 31, 21, 683, 378, 76, 48, 1121, 9, 296, 147, 137, 21, 3903, 3, 366, 11084, 6, 260, 4887, 1, 132, 31, 4763, 41, 22492, 14, 6349, 55, 20, 1997, 834, 29, 552, 2, 1308, 18, 926, 1, 3490, 6349, 1887, 4, 476, 552, 2, 1308, 140, 27, 1127, 1, 6289, 4, 705, 212, 1, 1974, 1557, 2, 39, 55, 1, 13856, 20, 9753, 3450, 3614, 1557, 6763, 3037, 1, 3767, 2, 581, 22492, 99, 4843, 911, 1, 1840, 132, 31, 630, 137, 3, 164, 11084, 6, 3058, 6599, 4887, 1817, 3, 9753, 3290, 4526, 107, 1342, 2, 5560, 17, 8, 1556, 353, 6, 22492, 11158, 16, 825, 6, 1736, 505, 999, 752, 487]",1696.0,18613994,668

Alternative splicing regulates activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID): implications for suppression of AID mutagenic activity in normal and malignant B cells.,Blood,Blood,2008-08-06,"The mutagenic enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is required for immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM) in germinal center (GC) B cells. Deregulated expression of AID is associated with various B-cell malignancies and, currently, it remains unclear how AID activity is extinguished to avoid illegitimate mutations. AID has also been shown to be alternatively spliced in malignant B cells, and there is limited evidence that this also occurs in normal blood B cells. The functional significance of these splice variants remains unknown. Here we show that normal GC human B cells and blood memory B cells similarly express AID splice variants and show for the first time that AID splicing variants are singly expressed in individual normal B cells as well as malignant B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. We further demonstrate that the alternative AID splice variants display different activities ranging from inactivation of CSR to inactivation or heightened SHM activity. Our data therefore suggest that CSR and SHM are differentially switched off by varying the expression of splicing products of AID at the individual cell level. Most importantly, our findings suggest a novel tumor suppression mechanism by which unnecessary AID mutagenic activities are promptly contained for GC B cells.",Journal Article,4185.0,33.0,The mutagenic enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase AID is required for immunoglobulin class switch recombination CSR and somatic hypermutation SHM in germinal center GC B cells Deregulated expression of AID is associated with various B-cell malignancies and currently it remains unclear how AID activity is extinguished to avoid illegitimate mutations AID has also been shown to be alternatively spliced in malignant B cells and there is limited evidence that this also occurs in normal blood B cells The functional significance of these splice variants remains unknown Here we show that normal GC human B cells and blood memory B cells similarly express AID splice variants and show for the first time that AID splicing variants are singly expressed in individual normal B cells as well as malignant B cells from chronic lymphocytic patients We further demonstrate that the alternative AID splice variants display different activities ranging from inactivation of CSR to inactivation or heightened SHM activity Our data therefore suggest that CSR and SHM are differentially switched off by varying the expression of splicing products of AID at the individual cell level Most importantly our findings suggest a novel tumor suppression mechanism by which unnecessary AID mutagenic activities are promptly contained for GC B cells,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 14578, 1644, 363, 277, 12783, 10197, 2427, 16, 616, 9, 2593, 1040, 5096, 4017, 28827, 2, 1119, 13521, 31331, 4, 6312, 574, 1709, 132, 37, 5415, 55, 1, 2427, 16, 41, 5, 747, 132, 31, 441, 2, 694, 192, 469, 1200, 832, 2427, 128, 16, 28697, 6, 3085, 24513, 138, 2427, 71, 120, 85, 443, 6, 40, 7133, 10945, 4, 393, 132, 37, 2, 125, 16, 383, 241, 17, 26, 120, 1780, 4, 295, 315, 132, 37, 3, 583, 724, 1, 46, 4371, 839, 469, 860, 467, 21, 514, 17, 295, 1709, 171, 132, 37, 2, 315, 2407, 132, 37, 1813, 1669, 2427, 4371, 839, 2, 514, 9, 3, 157, 98, 17, 2427, 3895, 839, 32, 16659, 570, 4, 797, 295, 132, 37, 22, 149, 22, 393, 132, 37, 29, 442, 1193, 7, 21, 195, 608, 17, 3, 1091, 2427, 4371, 839, 3640, 338, 2042, 2223, 29, 2297, 1, 28827, 6, 2297, 15, 7145, 31331, 128, 114, 74, 673, 309, 17, 28827, 2, 31331, 32, 2478, 7883, 1889, 20, 2990, 3, 55, 1, 3895, 2766, 1, 2427, 28, 3, 797, 31, 301, 96, 1859, 114, 272, 309, 8, 229, 30, 1332, 670, 20, 92, 4224, 2427, 14578, 2042, 32, 11396, 3070, 9, 1709, 132, 37]",1336.0,18684869,63

In this phase 2 study, the authors tested the safety and efficacy of early treatment for patients with high-risk CLL using alemtuzumab and rituximab. Patients were eligible for treatment if they were 1) previously untreated, 2) had no National Cancer Institute-Working Group 1996 criteria for treatment, and 3) had at least 1 marker of high-risk disease 17p13-, 11q22-, or a combination of unmutated IgVH and CD38+/ZAP70+). Treatment consisted of subcutaneous alemtuzumab (initial dose escalation followed by 30 mg on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for 4 weeks) and intravenous rituximab (375 mg/m(2) per week x4 doses). All patients received Pneumocystis pneumonia and herpes virus prophylaxis and were monitored for cytomegalovirus reactivation. Twenty-seven of 30 patients (90%) responded to therapy with 11 (37%) complete responses (CRs). Five patients (17%) patients who had a CR had no detectable minimal residual disease. The median response duration was 14.4 months, and only 9 patients required retreatment for progressive disease at the time of the current report (median follow-up, 17.6 months). Study patients had a significantly longer time from diagnosis to first treatment for CLL according to conventional indications than a comparison cohort with similar biologic risk profiles. The therapy regimen used was safe and effective for early treatment of patients with high-risk CLL. Further studies will be required to determine whether this early treatment strategy decreases morbidity and mortality for high-risk CLL.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",4129.0,70.0,Patients with chronic lymphocytic CLL usually are treated only for progressive disease However the discovery of biologic predictors of a high risk of disease progression together with the development of newer more targeted therapies could change this paradigm In this phase 2 study the authors tested the safety and efficacy of early treatment for patients with high-risk CLL using alemtuzumab and rituximab Patients were eligible for treatment if they were 1 previously untreated 2 had no National Cancer Institute-Working Group 1996 criteria for treatment and 3 had at least 1 marker of high-risk disease 17p13- 11q22- or a combination of unmutated IgVH and CD38+/ZAP70+ Treatment consisted of subcutaneous alemtuzumab initial dose escalation followed by 30 mg on Monday Wednesday and Friday for 4 weeks and intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m 2 per week x4 doses All patients received Pneumocystis pneumonia and herpes virus prophylaxis and were monitored for cytomegalovirus reactivation Twenty-seven of 30 patients 90 responded to therapy with 11 37 complete responses CRs Five patients 17 patients who had a CR had no detectable minimal residual disease The median response duration was 14.4 months and only 9 patients required retreatment for progressive disease at the time of the current report median follow-up 17.6 months Study patients had a significantly longer time from diagnosis to first treatment for CLL according to conventional indications than a comparison cohort with similar biologic risk profiles The therapy regimen used was safe and effective for early treatment of patients with high-risk CLL Further studies will be required to determine whether this early treatment strategy decreases morbidity and mortality for high-risk CLL,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[7, 5, 442, 1193, 552, 2082, 32, 73, 158, 9, 1014, 34, 137, 3, 1574, 1, 1283, 674, 1, 8, 64, 43, 1, 34, 91, 1162, 5, 3, 193, 1, 2246, 80, 238, 235, 359, 707, 26, 2431, 4, 26, 124, 18, 45, 3, 738, 650, 3, 367, 2, 209, 1, 191, 24, 9, 7, 5, 64, 43, 552, 75, 3579, 2, 855, 7, 11, 625, 9, 24, 492, 491, 11, 14, 373, 1278, 18, 42, 77, 657, 12, 1377, 2644, 87, 2648, 371, 9, 24, 2, 27, 42, 28, 506, 14, 952, 1, 64, 43, 34, 7526, 12647, 15, 8, 150, 1, 7216, 14484, 2, 4469, 12921, 24, 1695, 1, 2529, 3579, 388, 61, 1125, 370, 20, 201, 81, 23, 9339, 14412, 2, 9872, 9, 39, 244, 2, 1262, 855, 4175, 81, 188, 18, 379, 647, 45249, 415, 62, 7, 103, 13243, 3485, 2, 4716, 1450, 2049, 2, 11, 2909, 9, 7314, 3834, 737, 648, 1, 201, 7, 424, 2211, 6, 36, 5, 175, 567, 236, 253, 3115, 365, 7, 269, 7, 54, 42, 8, 684, 42, 77, 2083, 1048, 753, 34, 3, 52, 51, 654, 10, 213, 39, 53, 2, 158, 83, 7, 616, 6291, 9, 1014, 34, 28, 3, 98, 1, 3, 291, 414, 52, 166, 126, 269, 49, 53, 45, 7, 42, 8, 97, 589, 98, 29, 147, 6, 157, 24, 9, 552, 768, 6, 809, 2406, 76, 8, 1155, 180, 5, 288, 1283, 43, 1241, 3, 36, 477, 95, 10, 1165, 2, 323, 9, 191, 24, 1, 7, 5, 64, 43, 552, 195, 94, 303, 40, 616, 6, 223, 317, 26, 191, 24, 692, 2140, 787, 2, 282, 9, 64, 43, 552]",1750.0,18759253,279
Lenalidomide down-regulates the CD20 antigen and antagonizes direct and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of rituximab on primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.,Blood,Blood,2008-09-04,"Lenalidomide, an immunomodulatory agent that enhances antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), is currently being investigated as a therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The anti-CD20 antibody rituximab is active in CLL and represents a rational agent to combine with lenalidomide. We therefore examined whether lenalidomide combined with rituximab enhances direct apoptosis and ADCC in CLL cells. In contrast to previous reports using CD20-positive lymphoma cell lines, lenalidomide down-regulated CD20 surface antigen expression in CLL patient cells via enhanced internalization, without influencing transcription. The CD20 surface antigen internalization enhanced delivery of an oligonucleotide incorporated into anti-CD20 immunoliposomes. In addition, CD20 surface antigen down-modulation by lenalidomide in CLL was accompanied by diminished rituximab-mediated apoptosis and ADCC. These observations suggest a need for alternative sequencing strategies to avoid antagonism between lenalidomide and rituximab therapy in CLL. In addition, they suggest that lenalidomide therapy might be useful to enhance targeted delivery of RNAi-based therapies using CD20 immunoliposomes in B-cell malignancies.",Journal Article,4156.0,97.0,Lenalidomide an immunomodulatory agent that enhances antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC is currently being investigated as a therapy for chronic lymphocytic CLL The anti-CD20 antibody rituximab is active in CLL and represents a rational agent to combine with lenalidomide We therefore examined whether lenalidomide combined with rituximab enhances direct apoptosis and ADCC in CLL cells In contrast to previous reports using CD20-positive cell lines lenalidomide down-regulated CD20 surface antigen expression in CLL patient cells via enhanced internalization without influencing transcription The CD20 surface antigen internalization enhanced delivery of an oligonucleotide incorporated into anti-CD20 immunoliposomes In addition CD20 surface antigen down-modulation by lenalidomide in CLL was accompanied by diminished rituximab-mediated apoptosis and ADCC These observations suggest a need for alternative sequencing strategies to avoid antagonism between lenalidomide and rituximab therapy in CLL In addition they suggest that lenalidomide therapy might be useful to enhance targeted delivery of RNAi-based therapies using CD20 immunoliposomes in B-cell malignancies,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[1288, 35, 2555, 420, 17, 2519, 548, 470, 763, 1408, 5551, 16, 694, 486, 565, 22, 8, 36, 9, 442, 1193, 552, 3, 312, 2198, 548, 855, 16, 544, 4, 552, 2, 1449, 8, 2696, 420, 6, 4680, 5, 1288, 21, 673, 409, 317, 1288, 397, 5, 855, 2519, 1196, 351, 2, 5551, 4, 552, 37, 4, 748, 6, 698, 1198, 75, 2198, 109, 31, 285, 1288, 1328, 1065, 2198, 1255, 448, 55, 4, 552, 69, 37, 847, 651, 7520, 187, 4743, 866, 3, 2198, 1255, 448, 7520, 651, 989, 1, 35, 4727, 2449, 237, 312, 2198, 31220, 4, 352, 2198, 1255, 448, 1328, 2356, 20, 1288, 4, 552, 10, 2756, 20, 2849, 855, 517, 351, 2, 5551, 46, 2172, 309, 8, 594, 9, 1091, 615, 422, 6, 3085, 7537, 59, 1288, 2, 855, 36, 4, 552, 4, 352, 491, 309, 17, 1288, 36, 822, 40, 999, 6, 1304, 238, 989, 1, 5881, 90, 235, 75, 2198, 31220, 4, 132, 31, 441]",1181.0,18772452,207
Long-term outcome of allogeneic stem cell transplantation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: analysis after a minimum follow-up of 5 years.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2008-09-01,"In order to evaluate the long-term results of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we reviewed the outcome of 12 consecutive CLL patients, who underwent ASCT at the Mayo Clinic prior to July, 2004. Median age was 44 years (range 18-55) and median time from diagnosis to transplant 58.5 months. All patients had failed prior fludarabine-based chemotherapy and all but two patients had chemo-resistant refractory disease at time of transplant. A 'myeloablative' conditioning regimen was used in 11 patients and 'reduced intensity' in one. Bone marrow was the source of hematopoietic stem cells in 10 patients and peripheral blood in two. Donors were matched sibling in nine patients, unrelated in two and partial phenotypic match father in one. Grade II-IV acute and chronic graft versus host disease was documented in five and four patients, respectively. To date, six patients (50%) have died including four early deaths from infection. Complete remission (CR) was documented in eight patients (66.7%) post-transplant; six are currently alive whereas one died at 7 months from infection while still in CR and one relapsed 7 months post-transplant and died later. One CR patient relapsed after 4.5 years but was successfully re-transplanted and remains in second CR for 6.5+ years. Another patient recently relapsed after 10.5 years of CR. Duration of ASCT-induced CR in the remaining four patients was 6.5+, 8.5+, 9+ and 10+ years.

Therapeutic advances in leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome over the past 40 years.,Cancer,Cancer,2008-10-01,"Major therapeutic progress has been accomplished in leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) over the past 40 years, which may not be fully appreciated by the larger medical community. The objective of this review was to briefly highlight the treatment breakthroughs in leukemia and MDS. Therapeutic progress happened through better understanding of disease pathophysiologies and rational development of targeted agents, like imatinib mesylate in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and through astute, empirical discoveries in the clinic, like all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and chlorodeoxyadenosine in hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Today, the 5- to 10-year survival rates in patients with APL and HCL exceed 80%. In patients with CML, imatinib therapy has been associated with estimated 5- to 7-year survival rates from 85% to 90%. In patients with adult acute lymphocytic leukemia, modern intensive regimens have improved the 5-year survival rates from 20% up to 40%. In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chemoimmunotherapy recently produced high rates of quality responses and improved long-term outcome. In younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the 5-year survival rates range from 40% to 50%, although elderly AML remains a therapeutic challenge.

Inherited and acquired variations in the hyaluronan synthase 1 (HAS1) gene may contribute to disease progression in multiple myeloma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.,Blood,Blood,2008-09-24,"To characterize genetic contributions toward aberrant splicing of the hyaluronan synthase 1 (HAS1) gene in multiple myeloma (MM) and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM), we sequenced 3616 bp in HAS1 exons and introns involved in aberrant splicing, from 17 patients. We identified a total of 197 HAS1 genetic variations (GVs), a range of 3 to 24 GVs/patient, including 87 somatic GVs acquired in splicing regions of HAS1. Nearly all newly identified inherited and somatic GVs in MM and/or WM were absent from B chronic lymphocytic leukemia, nonmalignant disease, and healthy donors.

Clinical response and pharmacokinetics from a phase 1 study of an active dosing schedule of flavopiridol in relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2008-11-03,"We previously reported interim results of a phase 1 trial in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) whereby flavopiridol was administered intravenously as a 30-minute bolus followed by 4-hour infusion. We now report full pharmacokinetic (PK) data, correlations of PK with clinical outcomes, and final response and progression-free survival (PFS). Twenty-one (40%) of 52 patients with relapsed CLL achieved a partial response (PR) with a median PFS of 12 months. Responders included 17 (40%) of 43 fludarabine refractory patients, 7 (39%) of 18 patients with del(17p13), and 14 (74%) of 19 patients with del(11q22). Six responders received repeat therapy at relapse, and 5 responded again with a second median PFS of 10 months. Noncompartmental analysis and nonlinear mixed effects modeling was used to estimate PK parameters and evaluate covariates. Two-compartment population parameter estimates were 31.4 L/h, 65.8 L, 8.49 L/h, and 157 L for CL, V1, Q, and V2, respectively. Flavopiridol area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) correlated with clinical response and cytokine release syndrome, and glucuronide metabolite AUC correlated with tumor lysis syndrome.

Risk factors for acute graft-versus-host disease after human leukocyte antigen-identical sibling transplants for adults with leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2008-11-03,"Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) causes substantial morbidity and mortality after human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling transplants. No large registry studies of acute GVHD risk factors have been reported in two decades. Risk factors may have changed in this interval as transplant-related techniques have evolved. Acute GVHD risk factors were analyzed in 1,960 adults after HLA-identical sibling myeloablative transplant for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) reported by 226 centers worldwide to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research from 1995 to 2002. Outcome was measured as time from transplant to onset of grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD, with death without acute GVHD as a competing risk. Cumulative incidence of grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD was 35% (95% CI, 33% to 37%). In multivariable analyses, factors significantly associated with grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD were cyclophosphamide + total-body irradiation versus busulfan + cyclophosphamide (relative risk [RR] = 1.4; P < .0001), blood cell versus bone marrow grafts in patients age 18 to 39 years (RR = 1.43; P = .0023), recipient age 40 and older versus age 18 to 39 years receiving bone marrow grafts (RR = 1.44; P = .0005), CML versus AML/ALL (RR = 1.35; P = .0003), white/Black versus Asian/Hispanic race (RR = 1.54; P = .0003), Karnofsky performance score less than 90 versus 90 to 100 (RR = 1.27; P = .014), and recipient/donor cytomegalovirus-seronegative versus either positive (RR = 1.20; P = .04). Stratification by disease showed the same significant predictors of grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD for CML; however, KPS and cytomegalovirus serostatus were not significant predictors for AML/ALL. This analysis confirmed several previously reported risk factors for grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD. However, several new factors were identified whereas others are no longer significant.

"Mcl-1 expression predicts progression-free survival in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients treated with pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab.",Blood,Blood,2008-11-13,"Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) is an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family. Increased Mcl-1 expression is associated with failure to achieve remission after treatment with fludarabine and chlorambucil in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, the influence of Mcl-1 expression has not been examined in CLL trials using chemoimmunotherapy. We investigated Mcl-1 protein expression prospectively as part of a phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy of pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab in patients with untreated CLL. No significant difference by Mcl-1 expression was noted in pretreatment or response parameters. However, in patients with higher Mcl-1 expression, both minimal residual disease-negative status and progression-free survival was found to be significantly reduced (57% vs 19%, P = .01; 50.8 vs 18.7 months; P = .02; respectively).

B-cell count and survival: differentiating chronic lymphocytic leukemia from monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis based on clinical outcome.,Blood,Blood,2008-11-17,"The diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in asymptomatic patients has historically been based on documenting a characteristic lymphocyte clone and the presence of lymphocytosis. There are minimal data regarding which lymphocyte parameter (absolute lymphocyte count [ALC] or B-cell count) and what threshold should be used for diagnosis. We analyzed the relationship of ALC and B-cell count with clinical outcome in 459 patients with a clonal population of CLL phenotype to determine (1) whether the CLL diagnosis should be based on ALC or B-cell count, (2) what lymphocyte threshold should be used for diagnosis, and (3) whether any lymphocyte count has independent prognostic value after accounting for biologic/molecular prognostic markers. B-cell count and ALC had similar value for predicting treatment-free survival (TFS) and overall survival as continuous variables, but as binary factors, a B-cell threshold of 11 x 10(9)/L best predicted survival. B-cell count remained an independent predictor of TFS after controlling for ZAP-70, IGHV, CD38, or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results (all P < .001).

High-level expression of the T-cell chemokines CCL3 and CCL4 by chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells in nurselike cell cocultures and after BCR stimulation.,Blood,Blood,2008-12-12,"In lymphatic tissues, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells are interspersed with CD68(+) nurselike cells (NLCs), T cells, and other stromal cells that constitute the leukemia microenvironment. However, the mechanism regulating colocalization of CLL and these accessory cells are largely unknown. To dissect the molecular cross talk between CLL and NLCs, we profiled the gene expression of CD19-purified CLL cells before and after coculture with NLCs. NLC coculture induced high-level expression of B-cell maturation antigen and 2 chemoattractants (CCL3, CCL4) by CLL cells. CCL3/CCL4 induction in NLC cocultures correlated with ZAP-70 expression by CLL cells. High CCL3/CCL4 protein levels were found in CLL cocultures with NLCs, and CCL3/CCL4 induction was abrogated by R406, a Syk inhibitor, suggesting that NLCs induce these chemokines via B-cell receptor (BCR) activation.

Clin. Oncol.,2008-12-15,"Modern combination strategies are active in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) but can have significant myelosuppression and immunosuppression that may require dose attenuation for safety. We explored a sequential treatment strategy to allow safe delivery of active agents at full doses. Previously, we studied sequential therapy with fludarabine followed by cyclophosphamide (F-->C). In that study, cyclophosphamide consolidation improved the frequency of complete response (CR) four-fold. Subsequently, rituximab was added to this regimen (F-->C-->R). Thirty-six previously untreated CLL patients received therapy with fludarabine 25 mg/m(2) on days 1 through 5 every 4 weeks for six cycles, followed by consolidation with cyclophosphamide 3,000 mg/m(2) administered every 3 weeks for three cycles, followed by consolidation with weekly rituximab 375 mg/m(2) for four cycles. Evaluation for minimal residual disease included flow cytometry and a highly sensitive clonotypic polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The median age was 59 years (range, 37 to 71 years), 61% of patients had high-risk disease, and 58% had unmutated IgV(H) genes. There were 32 responses (89%), including 22 CRs (61%). Consolidation with cyclophosphamide improved responses in 13 patients (36%); nine patients (25%) further improved their response with rituximab. Twenty patients (56%) achieved flow cytometric CRs, and 12 patients (33%) achieved a molecular CR (PCR negative).

Validation of a new prognostic index for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2009-01-01,"The clinical course of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is highly variable. A prognostic index based on widely available clinical and laboratory features was recently developed to predict survival among patients with previously untreated CLL. This index requires validation in an independent series of patients before widespread use can be recommended. The Mayo Clinic CLL database was used to evaluate the validity and reproducibility of the new prognostic index. A total of 440 patients with newly diagnosed CLL who were seen at the Mayo Clinic within 12 months of diagnosis and for whom data were available with which to calculate index score were identified. Patients were classified as low, intermediate, or high risk using the prognostic index. The estimated median survival times were: not reached for low risk, 10.1 years for intermediate risk, and 7.2 years for high risk. The estimated median and 5-year survival by prognostic index risk category were similar to those originally reported. The prognostic index risk category added predictive value beyond that of Rai risk alone (P=.004). The prognostic index risk category remained a predictor of survival when analysis was limited to Rai stage 0 (P=.03) and nonreferred patients (P<.0001) and also predicted time to treatment (P<.0001). The results of the current study confirm the ability of a newly developed prognostic index to predict survival among patients with previously untreated CLL.

Specific activation of microRNA106b enables the p73 apoptotic response in chronic lymphocytic leukemia by targeting the ubiquitin ligase Itch for degradation.,Blood,Blood,2008-12-18,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by cells that exhibit dysfunctional apoptosis. Here, we show that deacetylase inhibition led to the E2F1- and myc-mediated transcriptional activation of the microRNA miR106b in primary CLL cells. Induction of miR106b was associated with a down-regulation in the levels of the E3-ubiquitin ligase Itch. Decreases in Itch protein levels were associated with a reciprocal accumulation of its proapoptotic substrate, TAp73 (p73), and induction of p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) mRNA and protein. This event was accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction, processing of caspase-9, and apoptosis of CLL cells. Ectopic expression of miR106b in CLL cells demonstrated that Itch was a direct target of miR106b such that miR106b-induced decreases in Itch resulted in an accumulation of p73. Thus, our results identify a novel regulatory mechanism wherein microRNA regulate cell survival by mediating the posttranscriptional down-regulation of an ubiquitin ligase, leading to the induction of a proapoptotic regulator in malignant cells. Silencing of miRNA expression in CLL may selectively suppress proapoptotic pathways, providing such tumors with a survival advantage.

Impact of hepatitis C virus seropositivity on survival after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for hematologic malignancies.,Haematologica,Haematologica,2009-01-14,"Because hepatitis C virus infection causes hepatic and immunological dysfunction, we hypothesized that seropositivity for this virus could be associated with increased non-relapse mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We performed a case-control study of the outcomes of patients who were hepatitis C virus seropositive at the time of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (N=31). Patients positive for hepatitis C virus were considered candidates for stem cell transplantation only if they had no significant evidence of hepatic dysfunction. Matched controls (N=31) were seronegative for viral hepatitides and were paired according to age, diagnosis, disease stage, conditioning regimen and donor type. We also compared the hepatitis C virus seropositive patients to all seronegative patients (all controls, N=1800) transplanted during the same period, to adjust for other confounding effects. The median age of the seropositive patients was 49 (range 26-72); 15 had acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome, 6 had chronic myeloid leukemia/myeloproliferative disease, 6 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 2 myeloma, 1 acute lymphocytic leukemia and 1 Hodgkin's lymphoma; 61% had poor risk disease; 68% had related donors; 68% received reduced intensity conditioning; 7 patients had mildly abnormal alanine transaminase levels (all less than three times the upper limit of normal) and 1 patient had minimally elevated bilirubin. These characteristics were similar to those of the matched control group. Median overall survival was 3, 18 and 20 months, and 1-year survival was 29%, 56% and 56%, in the hepatitis C virus, matched and all controls groups, respectively (hazard ratio for death 3.1, 95% confidence interval 1.9-5.6, p<0.001 in multivariate analysis). Non-relapse mortality at 1 year was 43%, 24% and 23%, respectively (hazard ratio 3.3, 95% confidence interval 1.8-7.1, p<0.01).

The novel plant-derived agent silvestrol has B-cell selective activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia in vitro and in vivo.,Blood,Blood,2009-02-03,"Therapeutic options for advanced B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are limited. Available treatments can also deplete T lymphocytes, leaving patients at risk of life-threatening infections. In the National Cancer Institute cell line screen, the structurally unique natural product silvestrol produces an unusual pattern of cytotoxicity that suggests activity in leukemia and selectivity for B cells. We investigated silvestrol efficacy using primary human B-leukemia cells, established B-leukemia cell lines, and animal models. In CLL cells, silvestrol LC(50) (concentration lethal to 50%) is 6.9 nM at 72 hours. At this concentration, there is no difference in sensitivity of cells from patients with or without the del(17p13.1) abnormality. In isolated cells and whole blood, silvestrol is more cytotoxic toward B cells than T cells.

Identifying pretreatment patient characteristics or prognostic factors associated with clinical outcomes is important for counseling patients, conducting clinical research, and evaluating trial results. We evaluated the pretreatment characteristics of 595 previously untreated patients who had National Cancer Institute Working Group indications to initiate front-line therapy for predictors of complete response (CR), time to treatment failure (TTF), and overall survival (OS). Multivariable models were developed for all three end points. CR is an important treatment end point correlated with longer TTF and OS. In this retrospective analysis, front-line treatment regimen was a significant independent predictive factor for all three end points; chemoimmunotherapy was the superior treatment regimen. Considering front-line treatment regimen, other independent patient characteristics associated with CR included age and beta(2)-microglobulin (beta-2M). TTF was independently associated with age, beta-2M, percent lymphocytes in bone marrow, and treatment regimen. Improved OS was independently associated with younger age, lower beta-2M, and treatment regimen. Two weighted prognostic models or nomograms, one including and one excluding treatment regimen, were constructed using significant characteristics to predict 5- and 10-year survival probability and estimate median survival time.

Curcumin inhibits prosurvival pathways in chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells and may overcome their stromal protection in combination with EGCG.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2009-02-01,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is incurable with current chemotherapy treatments. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), an active ingredient in the spice turmeric, inhibits tumor metastasis, invasion, and angiogenesis in tumor cell lines. We evaluated the effects of curcumin on the viability of primary CLL B cells and its ability to overcome stromal mediated protection. The in vitro effect of curcumin on primary CLL B cells was evaluated using fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis and Western blotting. For some experiments, CLL B cells were cocultured with human stromal cells to evaluate the effects of curcumin on leukemia cells cultured in their microenvironment. Finally, the effect of curcumin in combination with the green tea extract epigallocatechin-3 gallate (EGCG) was evaluated. Curcumin induced apoptosis in CLL B cells in a dose-dependent (5-20 micromol/L) manner and inhibited constitutively active prosurvival pathways, including signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), AKT, and nuclear factor kappaB. Moreover, curcumin suppressed expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and up-regulated the pro-apoptotic protein BIM. Coculture of CLL B cells with stromal cells resulted in elevated levels of STAT3, increased expression of Mcl-1 and XIAP, and decreased sensitivity to curcumin. When curcumin was administered simultaneously with EGCG, antagonism was observed for most patient samples. In contrast, sequential administration of these agents led to substantial increases in CLL B-cell death and could overcome stromal protection. Curcumin treatment was able to overcome stromal protection of CLL B cells on in vitro testing and to synergize with EGCG when administered in a sequential fashion. Additional evaluation of curcumin as a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of CLL seems warranted.",Journal Article,4006.0,82.0,Chronic lymphocytic CLL is incurable with current chemotherapy treatments Curcumin diferuloylmethane an active ingredient in the spice turmeric inhibits tumor metastasis invasion and angiogenesis in tumor cell lines We evaluated the effects of curcumin on the viability of primary CLL B cells and its ability to overcome stromal mediated protection The in vitro effect of curcumin on primary CLL B cells was evaluated using fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis and Western blotting For some experiments CLL B cells were cocultured with human stromal cells to evaluate the effects of curcumin on cells cultured in their microenvironment Finally the effect of curcumin in combination with the green tea extract epigallocatechin-3 gallate EGCG was evaluated Curcumin induced apoptosis in CLL B cells in a dose-dependent 5-20 micromol/L manner and inhibited constitutively active prosurvival pathways including signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 STAT3 AKT and nuclear factor kappaB Moreover curcumin suppressed expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein XIAP and up-regulated the pro-apoptotic protein BIM Coculture of CLL B cells with stromal cells resulted in elevated levels of STAT3 increased expression of Mcl-1 and XIAP and decreased sensitivity to curcumin When curcumin was administered simultaneously with EGCG antagonism was observed for most patient samples In contrast sequential administration of these agents led to substantial increases in CLL B-cell death and could overcome stromal protection Curcumin treatment was able to overcome stromal protection of CLL B cells on in vitro testing and to synergize with EGCG when administered in a sequential fashion Additional evaluation of curcumin as a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of CLL seems warranted,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[442, 1193, 552, 16, 2641, 5, 291, 56, 640, 3775, 24733, 35, 544, 26729, 4, 3, 26028, 19471, 1576, 30, 278, 578, 2, 1056, 4, 30, 31, 285, 21, 194, 3, 176, 1, 3775, 23, 3, 2120, 1, 86, 552, 132, 37, 2, 211, 801, 6, 1768, 1126, 517, 3525, 3, 4, 439, 254, 1, 3775, 23, 86, 552, 132, 37, 10, 194, 75, 1591, 735, 31, 20221, 65, 2, 1521, 3661, 9, 476, 2332, 552, 132, 37, 11, 11444, 5, 171, 1126, 37, 6, 376, 3, 176, 1, 3775, 23, 37, 3197, 4, 136, 995, 1368, 3, 254, 1, 3775, 4, 150, 5, 3, 4658, 8854, 7164, 15613, 27, 15965, 7729, 10, 194, 3775, 277, 351, 4, 552, 132, 37, 4, 8, 61, 470, 33, 179, 6297, 805, 1708, 2, 879, 2818, 544, 7331, 460, 141, 1235, 11439, 2, 7751, 1, 866, 27, 1439, 649, 2, 928, 161, 2119, 1393, 3775, 1908, 55, 1, 3, 312, 1631, 652, 1308, 14, 2, 1006, 1199, 230, 1, 351, 178, 5387, 2, 126, 1065, 3, 1805, 1631, 178, 3595, 7604, 1, 552, 132, 37, 5, 1126, 37, 627, 4, 804, 148, 1, 1439, 101, 55, 1, 1308, 14, 2, 5387, 2, 340, 485, 6, 3775, 198, 3775, 10, 468, 3074, 5, 7729, 7537, 10, 164, 9, 96, 69, 347, 4, 748, 1787, 634, 1, 46, 183, 836, 6, 1281, 1106, 4, 552, 132, 31, 273, 2, 359, 1768, 1126, 3525, 3775, 24, 10, 1665, 6, 1768, 1126, 3525, 1, 552, 132, 37, 23, 4, 439, 471, 2, 6, 8717, 5, 7729, 198, 468, 4, 8, 1787, 3240, 402, 451, 1, 3775, 22, 8, 174, 189, 420, 9, 24, 1, 552, 2744, 1197]",1846.0,19228728,185
"Mechanism of action of SNS-032, a novel cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",Blood,Blood,2009-02-20,"Inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) have been reported to have activities in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells by inhibiting Cdk7 and Cdk9, which control transcription. Here we studied the novel Cdk inhibitor SNS-032, which exhibits potent and selective inhibitory activity against Cdk2, Cdk7, and Cdk9. We hypothesized that transient inhibition of transcription by SNS-032 would decrease antiapoptotic proteins, resulting in cell death. SNS-032 effectively killed chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitro regardless of prognostic indicators and treatment history. This was associated with inhibition of phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II and inhibition of RNA synthesis. Consistent with the intrinsic turnover rates of their transcripts and proteins, antiapoptotic proteins, such as Mcl-1 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), were rapidly reduced on exposure to SNS-032, whereas Bcl-2 protein was not affected. The initial decrease of Mcl-1 protein was the result of transcriptional inhibition rather than cleavage by caspase. Compared with flavopiridol and roscovitine, SNS-032 was more potent, both in inhibition of RNA synthesis and at induction of apoptosis. SNS-032 activity was readily reversible; removal of SNS-032 reactivated RNA polymerase II, which led to resynthesis of Mcl-1 and cell survival.

Manufacturing validation of biologically functional T cells targeted to CD19 antigen for autologous adoptive cell therapy.,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",J. Immunother.,,"On the basis of promising preclinical data demonstrating the eradication of systemic B-cell malignancies by CD19-targeted T lymphocytes in vivo in severe combined immunodeficient-beige mouse models, we are launching phase I clinical trials in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We present here the validation of the bioprocess which we developed for the production and expansion of clinical grade autologous T cells derived from patients with CLL. We demonstrate that T cells genetically modified with a replication-defective gammaretroviral vector derived from the Moloney murine leukemia virus encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeted to CD19 (1928z) can be expanded with Dynabeads CD3/CD28. This bioprocess allows us to generate clinical doses of 1928z+ T cells in approximately 2 to 3 weeks in a large-scale semiclosed culture system using the Wave Bioreactor. These 1928z+ T cells remain biologically functional not only in vitro but also in severe combined immunodeficient-beige mice bearing disseminated tumors. The validation requirements in terms of T-cell expansion, T-cell transduction with the 1928z CAR, biologic activity, quality control testing, and release criteria were met for all 4 validation runs using apheresis products from patients with CLL.

Validation of an LC-MS based approach for profiling histones in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Proteomics,Proteomics,2009-03-01,"The in vitro evaluation of histones and their PTMs has drawn substantial interest in the development of epigenetic therapies. The differential expression of histone isoforms may serve as a potential marker in the classification of diseases affected by chromatin abnormalities.

Optimizing treatment with Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia: focus on dosing schedules.,Clinical lymphoma & myeloma,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma,2008-03-01,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), a genetic aberration that codes for bcrabl, which plays a key role in disease pathophysiology. The first oral inhibitor of Brc-Abl was imatinib, which also targets KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor kinase and has demonstrated improved outcomes when compared with interferon, the previous standard of care. Imatinib resistance and intolerance have been an issue for patients, and as a result, new therapeutic approaches have been evaluated. Dose-escalated imatinib (800 mg daily) has shown some limited activity in patients with imatinib-resistant CML, but the development of second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors has broadened the treatment options. Dasatinib is also an oral kinase inhibitor, but it has increased potency for Brc-Abl compared with imatinib. Dasatinib has demonstrated activity in all phases of CML and Ph+ acute lymphocytic leukemia and is approved for the treatment of adults in this setting. Recent phase III data have demonstrated that, in patients with chronic-phase CML, dasatinib 100 mg once daily is equally effective, with improved tolerability, compared with the previously approved 70-mg twice-daily dose.

We calculated smudge cell percentages (ratio of smudged to intact cells plus smudged lymphocytes) on archived blood smears from a cohort of previously untreated patients with predominantly early-stage CLL enrolled onto a prospective observational study. The relationship between percentage of smudge cells, patient survival, and other prognostic factors was explored. Between 1994 and 2002, 108 patients were enrolled onto the study and had archived blood smears available for review; 80% of patients had Rai stage 0 or I disease. The median smudge cell percentage was 28% (range, 1% to 75%). The percentage of smudge cells was lower in CD38(+) versus CD38(-) patients (P = .019) and in Zap70-positive versus Zap70-negative patients (P = .028). Smudge cell percentage as a continuous variable was associated with prolonged survival (P = .042). The 10-year survival rate was 50% for patients with 30% or less smudge cells compared with 80% for patients with more than 30% of smudge cells (P = .015).

Isoform-selective phosphoinositide 3'-kinase inhibitors inhibit CXCR4 signaling and overcome stromal cell-mediated drug resistance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a novel therapeutic approach.,Blood,Blood,2009-03-24,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are among the most frequently activated signaling pathways in cancer. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), signals from the microenvironment are critical for expansion of the malignant B cells, and cause constitutive activation of PI3Ks. CXCR4 is a key receptor for CLL cell migration and adhesion to marrow stromal cells (MSCs). Because of the importance of CXCR4 and PI3Ks for CLL-microenvironment cross-talk, we investigated the activity of novel, isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors that target different isoforms of the p110-kDa subunit. Inhibition with p110alpha inhibitors (PIK-90 and PI-103) resulted in a significant reduction of chemotaxis and actin polymerization to CXCL12 and reduced migration beneath MSC (pseudoemperipolesis). Western blot and reverse phase protein array analyses consistently demonstrated that PIK-90 and PI-103 inhibited phosphorylation of Akt and S6, whereas p110delta or p110beta/p110delta inhibitors were less effective.

Aberrant regulation of pVHL levels by microRNA promotes the HIF/VEGF axis in CLL B cells.,Blood,Blood,2009-03-31,"The molecular mechanism of autocrine regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells is unknown. Here, we report that CLL B cells express constitutive levels of HIF-1alpha under normoxia. We have examined the status of the von Hippel-Lindau gene product (pVHL) that is responsible for HIF-1alpha degradation and found it to be at a notably low level in CLL B cells compared with normal B cells. We demonstrate that the microRNA, miR-92-1, overexpressed in CLL B cells, can target the VHL transcript to repress its expression. We found that the stabilized HIF-1alpha can form an active complex with the transcriptional coactivator p300 and phosphorylated-STAT3 at the VEGF promoter and recruit RNA polymerase II.

Lymphoma,2009-03-01,"We evaluated the clinical activity of GM-CSF in combination with standard dose rituximab in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The rationale for exploring this combination is provided by the ability of GM-CSF to increase surface expression of CD20 in CLL cells and potentially render them a better target for rituximab. GM-CSF also enhances antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against CLL cells. The combination of GM-CSF and rituximab was evaluated as initial treatment in elderly patients with indication for treatment and in patients at high risk for progression identified by elevated beta(2) microglobulin. This combination was also evaluated in patients with recurrent CLL. On the basis of the results of 118 patients, we observed an overall response rate of 65 and 9% complete remission and these results compare favourably with the results obtained with rituximab single agent. This combination was well tolerated with the most common toxicity consisting in mild GM-CSF injection site erythema.

Genetic variation in B-cell-activating factor is associated with an increased risk of developing B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2009-04-21,"Elevated B-cell-activating factor (BAFF; TNFSF13B) levels have been found in patients with B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases, suggesting that it may play a pathogenic role. We previously found that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the TNFSF13B promoter resulted in increased transcription, suggesting that genetic variation in TNFSF13B may influence its expression. We therefore wanted to determine if genetic variation in TNFSF13B is associated with high BAFF levels and non-Hogkin lymphoma (NHL) risk. We genotyped 9 tagSNPs within TNFSF13B in a clinic-based study of 441 NHL cases and 475 matched controls and evaluated the association of individual SNPs with risk of NHL; 3 tagSNPs were significant (P < 0.05).

Treatment of fludarabine-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2009-07-01,"The development of resistance to purine analogs defines a poor-risk subset of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Although in recent years chemoimmunotherapeutic combinations such as fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab have induced response rates of 95% in previously untreated patients and increased the rates of failure-free survival, CLL remains incurable for many patients because of a lack of disease response or the development of refractoriness to fludarabine. Fludarabine-refractory disease is defined as CLL that does not respond to fludarabine or that recurs within 6 months of treatment with a fludarabine-containing regimen. The natural course of the disease is associated with poor survival. Salvage therapeutic strategies include alemtuzumab-containing regimens, targeted agents, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Single-agent alemtuzumab induces response in up to 40% of patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL, but responses are not durable, and the median survival is approximately 1 to 2 years. Alemtuzumab is also combined with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and/or rituximab, and other agents such as lenalidomide and flavopiridol, as well as targeted agents, and used in fludarabine-refractory CLL. Cumulative evidence suggests that allogeneic stem cell transplantation is an efficacious therapeutic strategy for patients who do not respond to fludarabine or who develop disease recurrence within 12 months after purine analog treatment.

"B-cell antigen receptor signaling enhances chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell migration and survival: specific targeting with a novel spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor, R406.",Blood,Blood,2009-06-02,"Antigenic stimulation through the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) is considered to promote the expansion of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells. The spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), a key component of BCR signaling, can be blocked by R406, a small-molecule Syk inhibitor, that displayed activity in CLL patients in a first clinical trial. In this study, we investigated the effects of BCR stimulation and R406 on CLL cell survival and migration. The prosurvival effects promoted by anti-IgM stimulation and nurselike cells were abrogated by R406. BCR triggering up-regulated adhesion molecules, and increased CLL cell migration toward the chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL13. BCR activation also enhanced CLL cell migration beneath marrow stromal cells. These responses were blocked by R406, which furthermore abrogated BCR-dependent secretion of T-cell chemokines (CCL3 and CCL4) by CLL cells.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: treatment options for patients with refractory disease.,Cancer,Cancer,2009-09-01,"Patients with purine analogue-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have short survival and limited treatment options. Defining the best salvage strategies for this population is challenging, because limited data are available from clinical trials, and because studies have enrolled mixed populations (patients with recurrent and refractory disease or patients with refractory disease and Richter transformation). Moreover, patients with refractory CLL have a high incidence of unfavorable molecular and clinical features, such as high-risk genomic profiles, unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes, expression of zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70, and bulky lymphadenopathies. These patients are also severely immunosuppressed because of the underlying disease and the treatments received, and experience a high rate of infectious complications that pose an additional difficulty in selecting treatment. Despite these challenges, in parallel with better characterizations of the biologic features of refractory CLL, the number of available treatment modalities for this population has increased.

Sonic hedgehog signaling proteins and ATP-binding cassette G2 are aberrantly expressed in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2009-07-10,"Dysregulation of the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway has been shown in several cancer types, but has not been explored in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We assessed 67 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma for expression of SHH (ligand), GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3 (transcriptional effectors of SHH signaling), and the ATP-binding cassette (ABC)G2 (a downstream target of SHH signaling), using immunohistochemistry. For comparison, we assessed the expression levels of these proteins in 28 cases of follicular lymphoma, 5 chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, and 5 reactive lymph nodes. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, SHH was expressed in 61 of 67 (91%) cases, GLI1 in 62 of 67 (93%), GLI2 in 41 of 56 (73%), and GLI3 in 22 of 56 (39%). Expression of ABCG2 was detected in 52 of 55 (95%) cases and was high in 15 (27%) cases. SHH expression positively correlated with expression levels of ABCG2 (P=0.05). Patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with high ABCG2 expression showed significantly shorter overall survival (P=0.031) and failure-free survival (P=0.029) compared with patients with tumors with low or no expression of ABCG2. Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas expressed SHH, and GLI1, GLI2, and GLI3 more frequently and more intensely than cases of follicular lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. In conclusion, our data show that SHH signaling proteins and ABCG2 are aberrantly expressed in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and that ABCG2 expression has prognostic implications. These findings also provide evidence that dysregulation of the SHH pathway may be involved in the pathogenesis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.",Comparative Study,3847.0,67.0,Dysregulation of the sonic hedgehog SHH signaling pathway has been shown in several cancer types but has not been explored in diffuse large B-cell We assessed 67 cases of diffuse large B-cell for expression of SHH ligand GLI1 GLI2 and GLI3 transcriptional effectors of SHH signaling and the ATP-binding cassette ABC G2 a downstream target of SHH signaling using immunohistochemistry For comparison we assessed the expression levels of these proteins in 28 cases of follicular 5 chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic and 5 reactive lymph nodes In diffuse large B-cell SHH was expressed in 61 of 67 91 cases GLI1 in 62 of 67 93 GLI2 in 41 of 56 73 and GLI3 in 22 of 56 39 Expression of ABCG2 was detected in 52 of 55 95 cases and was high in 15 27 cases SHH expression positively correlated with expression levels of ABCG2 P=0.05 Patients with diffuse large B-cell with high ABCG2 expression showed significantly shorter overall survival P=0.031 and failure-free survival P=0.029 compared with patients with tumors with low or no expression of ABCG2 Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas expressed SHH and GLI1 GLI2 and GLI3 more frequently and more intensely than cases of follicular or chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic In conclusion our data show that SHH signaling proteins and ABCG2 are aberrantly expressed in diffuse large B-cell and that ABCG2 expression has prognostic implications These findings also provide evidence that dysregulation of the SHH pathway may be involved in the pathogenesis of diffuse large B-cell,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[3935, 1, 3, 10025, 4097, 5170, 314, 308, 71, 85, 443, 4, 392, 12, 630, 84, 71, 44, 85, 1443, 4, 1388, 375, 132, 31, 21, 275, 598, 140, 1, 1388, 375, 132, 31, 9, 55, 1, 5170, 1232, 5124, 14637, 2, 25181, 1431, 4926, 1, 5170, 314, 2, 3, 3918, 791, 10548, 5106, 3774, 8, 1489, 283, 1, 5170, 314, 75, 888, 9, 1155, 21, 275, 3, 55, 148, 1, 46, 652, 4, 339, 140, 1, 1974, 33, 442, 1193, 2647, 302, 1193, 2, 33, 2163, 263, 502, 4, 1388, 375, 132, 31, 5170, 10, 570, 4, 713, 1, 598, 970, 140, 5124, 4, 744, 1, 598, 966, 14637, 4, 605, 1, 664, 803, 2, 25181, 4, 350, 1, 664, 587, 55, 1, 6447, 10, 530, 4, 653, 1, 614, 48, 140, 2, 10, 64, 4, 167, 428, 140, 5170, 55, 2375, 438, 5, 55, 148, 1, 6447, 19, 13, 474, 7, 5, 1388, 375, 132, 31, 5, 64, 6447, 55, 224, 97, 985, 63, 25, 19, 13, 5304, 2, 496, 115, 25, 19, 13, 4770, 72, 5, 7, 5, 57, 5, 154, 15, 77, 55, 1, 6447, 1388, 375, 132, 31, 1557, 570, 5170, 2, 5124, 14637, 2, 25181, 80, 746, 2, 80, 20549, 76, 140, 1, 1974, 15, 442, 1193, 2647, 302, 1193, 4, 1221, 114, 74, 514, 17, 5170, 314, 652, 2, 6447, 32, 5619, 570, 4, 1388, 375, 132, 31, 2, 17, 6447, 55, 71, 177, 1268, 46, 272, 120, 377, 241, 17, 3935, 1, 3, 5170, 308, 68, 40, 646, 4, 3, 1384, 1, 1388, 375, 132, 31]",1538.0,19593328,280
Brief report: natural history of individuals with clinically recognized monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis compared with patients with Rai 0 chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-07-20,"The diagnosis of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is used to characterize patients with a circulating population of clonal B cells, a total B-cell count of less than 5 x 10(9)/L, and no other features of a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder including lymphadenopathy/organomegaly. The natural history of clinically identified MBL is unclear. The goal of this study was to explore the outcome of patients with MBL relative to that of individuals with Rai stage 0 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We used hematopathology records to identify a cohort of 631 patients with newly diagnosed MBL or Rai stage 0 CLL. Within this cohort, 302 patients had MBL (B-cell counts of 0.02 to 4.99 x 10(9)/L); 94 patients had Rai stage 0 CLL with an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) < or = 10 x 10(9)/L; and 219 patients had Rai stage 0 CLL with an ALC more than 10 x 10(9)/L. Data on clinical outcome were abstracted from medical records. The percentage of MBL patients free of treatment at 1, 2, and 5 years was 99%, 98%, and 93%, respectively. B-cell count as a continuous variable (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.9, P = .04) and CD38 status (HR = 10.8, P = .006) predicted time to treatment (TTT) among MBL patients. The likelihood of treatment for MBL patients was lower (HR = 0.32, P = .04) than that of both Rai stage 0 CLL patients with an ALC less than 10 x 10(9)/L (n = 94) and Rai stage 0 CLL patients with an ALC more than 10 x 10(9)/L (n = 219; P = .0003). Individuals with MBL identified in clinical practice have a low risk for progression at 5 years. Because B-cell count seems to relate to TTT as a continuous variable, additional studies are needed to determine what B-cell count should be used to distinguish between MBL and CLL.",Comparative Study,3837.0,100.0,The diagnosis of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis MBL is used to characterize patients with a circulating population of clonal B cells a total B-cell count of less than 5 x 10 9 /L and no other features of a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder including lymphadenopathy/organomegaly The natural history of clinically identified MBL is unclear The goal of this study was to explore the outcome of patients with MBL relative to that of individuals with Rai stage 0 chronic lymphocytic CLL We used hematopathology records to identify a cohort of 631 patients with newly diagnosed MBL or Rai stage 0 CLL Within this cohort 302 patients had MBL B-cell counts of 0.02 to 4.99 x 10 9 /L 94 patients had Rai stage 0 CLL with an absolute lymphocyte count ALC or 10 x 10 9 /L and 219 patients had Rai stage 0 CLL with an ALC more than 10 x 10 9 /L Data on clinical outcome were abstracted from medical records The percentage of MBL patients free of treatment at 1 2 and 5 years was 99 98 and 93 respectively B-cell count as a continuous variable hazard ratio HR 2.9 P .04 and CD38 status HR 10.8 P .006 predicted time to treatment TTT among MBL patients The likelihood of treatment for MBL patients was lower HR 0.32 P .04 than that of both Rai stage 0 CLL patients with an ALC less than 10 x 10 9 /L n 94 and Rai stage 0 CLL patients with an ALC more than 10 x 10 9 /L n 219 P .0003 Individuals with MBL identified in clinical practice have a low risk for progression at 5 years Because B-cell count seems to relate to TTT as a continuous variable additional studies are needed to determine what B-cell count should be used to distinguish between MBL and CLL,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 147, 1, 848, 132, 31, 8125, 8992, 16, 95, 6, 1507, 7, 5, 8, 1033, 266, 1, 1946, 132, 37, 8, 181, 132, 31, 1276, 1, 299, 76, 33, 1006, 79, 83, 805, 2, 77, 127, 404, 1, 8, 132, 31, 4192, 2645, 141, 4962, 16738, 3, 1504, 532, 1, 505, 108, 8992, 16, 1200, 3, 1326, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 1645, 3, 228, 1, 7, 5, 8992, 580, 6, 17, 1, 869, 5, 4121, 82, 13, 442, 1193, 552, 21, 95, 30197, 1064, 6, 255, 8, 180, 1, 14576, 7, 5, 732, 265, 8992, 15, 4121, 82, 13, 552, 262, 26, 180, 4952, 7, 42, 8992, 132, 31, 1911, 1, 13, 588, 6, 39, 1058, 1006, 79, 83, 805, 960, 7, 42, 4121, 82, 13, 552, 5, 35, 1766, 1448, 1276, 3749, 15, 79, 1006, 79, 83, 805, 2, 6679, 7, 42, 4121, 82, 13, 552, 5, 35, 3749, 80, 76, 79, 1006, 79, 83, 805, 74, 23, 38, 228, 11, 4106, 29, 484, 1064, 3, 1150, 1, 8992, 7, 115, 1, 24, 28, 14, 18, 2, 33, 60, 10, 1058, 1096, 2, 966, 106, 132, 31, 1276, 22, 8, 1314, 1347, 360, 197, 168, 18, 83, 19, 755, 2, 4469, 156, 168, 79, 66, 19, 1861, 783, 98, 6, 24, 10630, 107, 8992, 7, 3, 1420, 1, 24, 9, 8992, 7, 10, 280, 168, 13, 531, 19, 755, 76, 17, 1, 110, 4121, 82, 13, 552, 7, 5, 35, 3749, 299, 76, 79, 1006, 79, 83, 805, 78, 960, 2, 4121, 82, 13, 552, 7, 5, 35, 3749, 80, 76, 79, 1006, 79, 83, 805, 78, 6679, 19, 4418, 869, 5, 8992, 108, 4, 38, 758, 47, 8, 154, 43, 9, 91, 28, 33, 60, 408, 132, 31, 1276, 2744, 6, 6509, 6, 10630, 22, 8, 1314, 1347, 402, 94, 32, 575, 6, 223, 2067, 132, 31, 1276, 257, 40, 95, 6, 3081, 59, 8992, 2, 552]",1648.0,19620484,66
JAK2 mutation in a patient with CLL with coexistent myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN).,Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2009-07-22,"JAK2 mutation has not been described in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We found JAK2 mutation in a patient with CLL and coexisting myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN).

A phase 2 study of yttrium-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2009-10-01,"Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with radio-labeled monoclonal antibodies to CD20 produce a high response rate in patients with relapsed lymphoma. Use of this modality in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has been hampered by the extensive marrow involvement seen in patients with CLL, which would produce a high risk for marrow aplasia after treatment with RIT. Patients with lymphoma and marrow involvement have been treated with RIT if involved marrow was less than 25% of the total marrow. Thus, we adapted this approach as consolidation therapy in patients with CLL responding to chemoimmunotherapy. Fourteen patients with relapsed CLL either in partial remission or in complete remission but with disease documented by flow cytometry were treated with (90)Y ibritumomab tiuxetan. One patient responded and achieved a complete remission but with residual disease detected by flow cytometry. Of note was that grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity was seen in 12 of the 13 (92%) evaluable patients, with grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia noted in 11 (85%) of the patients. In addition, myelosuppression was prolonged with a median duration of grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia of 37 days. Five patients had persistent thrombocytopenia 3 months post-therapy.

Epigenetic changes during disease progression in a murine model of human chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2009-07-28,"Epigenetic alterations, including gain or loss of DNA methylation, are a hallmark of nearly every malignancy. Changes in DNA methylation can impact expression of cancer-related genes including apoptosis regulators and tumor suppressors. Because such epigenetic changes are reversible, they are being aggressively investigated as potential therapeutic targets. Here we use the Emu-TCL1 transgenic mouse model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) to determine the timing and patterns of aberrant DNA methylation, and to investigate the mechanisms that lead to aberrant DNA methylation. We show that CLL cells from Emu-TCL1 mice at various stages recapitulate epigenetic alterations seen in human CLL. Aberrant methylation of promoter sequences is observed as early as 3 months of age in these animals, well before disease onset. Abnormally methylated promoter regions include binding sites for the transcription factor FOXD3. We show that loss of Foxd3 expression due to an NF-kappaB p50/p50:HDAC1 repressor complex occurs in TCL1-positive B cells before methylation. Therefore, specific transcriptional repression is an early event leading to epigenetic silencing of target genes in murine and human CLL. These results provide strong rationale for the development of strategies to target NF-kappaB components in CLL and potentially other B-cell malignancies.",Journal Article,3829.0,68.0,Epigenetic alterations including gain or loss of DNA methylation are a hallmark of nearly every malignancy Changes in DNA methylation can impact expression of cancer-related genes including apoptosis regulators and tumor suppressors Because such epigenetic changes are reversible they are being aggressively investigated as potential therapeutic targets Here we use the Emu-TCL1 transgenic mouse model of chronic lymphocytic CLL to determine the timing and patterns of aberrant DNA methylation and to investigate the mechanisms that lead to aberrant DNA methylation We show that CLL cells from Emu-TCL1 mice at various stages recapitulate epigenetic alterations seen in human CLL Aberrant methylation of promoter sequences is observed as early as 3 months of age in these animals well before disease onset Abnormally methylated promoter regions include binding sites for the transcription factor FOXD3 We show that loss of Foxd3 expression due to an NF-kappaB p50/p50 HDAC1 repressor complex occurs in TCL1-positive B cells before methylation Therefore specific transcriptional repression is an early event leading to epigenetic silencing of target genes in murine and human CLL These results provide strong rationale for the development of strategies to target NF-kappaB components in CLL and potentially other B-cell malignancies,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[1418, 593, 141, 1803, 15, 407, 1, 261, 569, 32, 8, 4683, 1, 1857, 454, 710, 400, 4, 261, 569, 122, 345, 55, 1, 12, 139, 214, 141, 351, 3196, 2, 30, 5704, 408, 225, 1418, 400, 32, 2786, 491, 32, 486, 8503, 565, 22, 174, 189, 637, 467, 21, 119, 3, 28315, 8979, 2862, 830, 202, 1, 442, 1193, 552, 6, 223, 3, 1972, 2, 764, 1, 1898, 261, 569, 2, 6, 963, 3, 483, 17, 1122, 6, 1898, 261, 569, 21, 514, 17, 552, 37, 29, 28315, 8979, 399, 28, 747, 1153, 7746, 1418, 593, 527, 4, 171, 552, 1898, 569, 1, 973, 2866, 16, 164, 22, 191, 22, 27, 53, 1, 89, 4, 46, 2258, 149, 348, 34, 1707, 11749, 2963, 973, 1374, 643, 791, 633, 9, 3, 866, 161, 18573, 21, 514, 17, 407, 1, 18573, 55, 520, 6, 35, 1365, 2119, 16197, 16197, 14241, 7434, 840, 1780, 4, 8979, 109, 132, 37, 348, 569, 673, 112, 1431, 5255, 16, 35, 191, 774, 1049, 6, 1418, 2077, 1, 283, 214, 4, 1471, 2, 171, 552, 46, 99, 377, 1082, 1728, 9, 3, 193, 1, 422, 6, 283, 1365, 2119, 1628, 4, 552, 2, 751, 127, 132, 31, 441]",1331.0,19666576,188

"Pim kinase inhibitor, SGI-1776, induces apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.",Blood,Blood,2009-09-04,"Pim kinases are involved in B-cell development and are overexpressed in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We hypothesized that Pim kinase inhibition would affect B-cell survival. Identified from a screen of imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine compounds, SGI-1776 inhibits Pim-1, Pim-2, and Pim-3. Treatment of CLL cells with SGI-1776 results in a concentration-dependent induction of apoptosis. To elucidate its mechanism of action, we evaluated the effect of SGI-1776 on Pim kinase function. Unlike in replicating cells, phosphorylation of traditional Pim-1 kinase targets, phospho-Bad (Ser112) and histone H3 (Ser10), and cell-cycle proteins were unaffected by SGI-1776, suggesting an alternative mechanism in CLL. Protein levels of total c-Myc as well as phospho-c-Myc(Ser62), a Pim-1 target site, were decreased after SGI-1776 treatment. Levels of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), XIAP, and proapoptotic Bak and Bax were unchanged; however, a significant reduction in Mcl-1 was observed that was not caused by caspase-mediated cleavage of Mcl-1 protein. The mechanism of decline in Mcl-1 was at the RNA level and was correlated with inhibition of global RNA synthesis. Consistent with a decline in new RNA synthesis, MCL-1 transcript levels were decreased after treatment with SGI-1776.

Diverse marrow stromal cells protect CLL cells from spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis: development of a reliable and reproducible system to assess stromal cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance.,Blood,Blood,2009-09-17,"Marrow stromal cells (MSCs) provide important survival and drug resistance signals to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, but current models to analyze CLL-MSC interactions are heterogeneous. Therefore, we tested different human and murine MSC lines and primary human MSCs for their ability to protect CLL cells from spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis. Our results show that both human and murine MSCs are equally effective in protecting CLL cells from fludarabine-induced apoptosis. This protective effect was sustained over a wide range of CLL-MSC ratios (5:1 to 100:1), and the levels of protection were reproducible in 4 different laboratories. Human and murine MSCs also protected CLL cells from dexamethasone- and cyclophosphamide-induced apoptosis. This protection required cell-cell contact and was virtually absent when CLL cells were separated from the MSCs by micropore filters.

Flavopiridol in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a concise review.,Clinical lymphoma & myeloma,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma,2009-01-01,"Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with high-risk cytogenetic features such as del(17p13) have limited treatment options and decreased overall survival. Dysfunction of p53 leads to resistance to fludarabine-based therapies. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKi) are a novel class of agents that induce apoptosis in CLL cells independent of p53 mutational status. The synthetic flavone flavopiridol demonstrated promising in vitro activity in CLL. In initial phase I studies using a continuous infusion dosing schedule in a variety of malignancies, no clinical activity was observed. Detailed pharmacokinetic modeling led to the development of a novel dosing schedule designed to achieve target drug concentrations in vivo. In phase I testing, this dosing schedule resulted in acute tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) as the dose-limiting toxicity. With the implementation of a standardized protocol to prevent severe TLS, flavopiridol was administered safely, and responses were observed in heavily pretreated, fludarabine-refractory patients, cytogenetically high-risk patients, and patients with bulky lymphadenopathy. In a pharmacokinetic analysis, flavopiridol area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) correlated with clinical response and cytokine release syndrome. Phase II studies are under way with encouraging preliminary results. Flavopiridol is currently under active investigation in combination with other agents and as a means to eradicate minimal residual disease in patients following cytoreductive chemotherapy.

Phase II study of flavopiridol in relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia demonstrating high response rates in genetically high-risk disease.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-10-13,"Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with high-risk genomic features achieve poor outcomes with traditional therapies. A phase I study of a pharmacokinetically derived schedule of flavopiridol suggested promising activity in CLL, irrespective of high-risk features. Given the relevance of these findings to treating genetically high-risk CLL, a prospective confirmatory study was initiated. Patients with relapsed CLL were treated with single-agent flavopiridol, with subsequent addition of dexamethasone to suppress cytokine release syndrome (CRS). High-risk genomic features were prospectively assessed for response to therapy. Sixty-four patients were enrolled. Median age was 60 years, median number of prior therapies was four, and all patients had received prior purine analog therapy. If patients tolerated treatment during week 1, dose escalation occurred during week 2. Dose escalation did not occur in four patients, as a result of severe tumor lysis syndrome; three of these patients required hemodialysis. Thirty-four patients (53%) achieved response, including 30 partial responses (PRs; 47%), three nodular PRs (5%), and one complete response (1.6%). A majority of high-risk patients responded; 12 (57%) of 21 patients with del(17p13.1) and 14 (50%) of 28 patients with del(11q22.3) responded irrespective of lymph node size. Median progression-free survival among responders was 10 to 12 months across all cytogenetic risk groups. Reducing the number of weekly treatments per cycle from four to three and adding prophylactic dexamethasone, which abrogated interleukin-6 release and CRS (P < or = .01), resulted in improved tolerability and treatment delivery. Flavopiridol achieves significant clinical activity in patients with relapsed CLL, including those with high-risk genomic features and bulky lymphadenopathy.

Evidence of serum immunoglobulin abnormalities up to 9.8 years before diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a prospective study.,Blood,Blood,2009-10-14,"Immune-related deficiencies are well-known complications of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Although recent data indicate that almost all CLL patients are preceded by a monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis precursor state, patterns of immune defects preceding CLL diagnosis are unclear. We identified 109 persons who developed CLL from the prospective and nationwide Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial with 77 469 participants, with serially collected prediagnostic serum samples. We assayed monoclonal (M)-proteins, kappa/lambda free light chains (FLCs) in prediagnostic obtained up to 9.8 years before CLL diagnosis. The prevalence of an abnormal FLC ratio, M-protein, and hypogamma-globulinemia before CLL diagnosis was 38% (95% confidence interval, 29%-47%), 13% (7%-21%), and 3% (1%-8%), respectively. M-proteins and abnormal FLC ratios were detected up to 9.8 years before CLL diagnosis in a total of 48 persons (44%). Hypogammaglobulinemia was not present until 3 years before the diagnosis of CLL.

Clinical data from a phase 1 trial with lumiliximab demonstrated an acceptable toxicity profile in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We therefore pursued a phase 1/2 dose-escalation study of lumiliximab added to fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) in previously treated CLL patients. Thirty-one patients received either 375 mg/m(2) (n = 3) or 500 mg/m(2) (n = 28) of lumiliximab in combination with FCR for 6 cycles. The toxicity profile was similar to that previously reported for FCR in treatment of relapsed CLL. The overall response rate was 65%, with 52% of patients achieving a complete response (CR), which compares favorably with the CR rate previously reported for the FCR regimen alone in relapsed CLL. The estimated median progression-free survival for all responders was 28.7 months. The addition of lumiliximab to FCR therapy is feasible, achieves a high CR rate, and does not appear to enhance toxicity in previously treated patients with CLL.

Epigenetic alterations in a murine model for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",Cell Cycle,2009-11-01,"Early stages in the development of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have not been explored mainly due to the inability to study normal B-cells en route to transformation. In order to determine such early events of leukemogenesis, we have used a well established mouse model for CLL. Over-expression of human TCL1, a known CLL oncogene in murine B-cells leads to the development of mature CD19+/CD5+/IgM+ clonal leukemia with a disease phenotype similar to that seen in human CLL. Herein, we review our recent study using this TCL1-driven mouse model for CLL and corresponding human CLL samples in a cross-species epigenomics approach to address the timing and relevance of epigenetic events occurring during leukemogenesis. We demonstrated that the mouse model recapitulates the epigenetic events that have been reported for human CLL, affirming the power and validity of this mouse model to study early epigenetic events in cancer progression. Epigenetic alterations are detected as early as three months after birth, far before disease manifests at about 11 months of age. These mice undergo NFkappaB repressor complex mediated inactivation of the transcription factor Foxd3, whose targets become aberrantly methylated and silenced in mouse and human CLL. Overall, our data suggest the accumulated epigenetic alterations during CLL pathogenesis as a consequence of gene silencing through TCL1 and NFkappaB repressor complex, suggesting the relevance for NFkappaB as a therapeutic target in CLL.",Journal Article,3733.0,16.0,Early stages in the development of chronic lymphocytic CLL have not been explored mainly due to the inability to study normal B-cells en route to transformation In order to determine such early events of leukemogenesis we have used a well established mouse model for CLL Over-expression of human TCL1 a known CLL oncogene in murine B-cells leads to the development of mature CD19+/CD5+/IgM+ clonal with a disease phenotype similar to that seen in human CLL Herein we review our recent study using this TCL1-driven mouse model for CLL and corresponding human CLL samples in a cross-species epigenomics approach to address the timing and relevance of epigenetic events occurring during leukemogenesis We demonstrated that the mouse model recapitulates the epigenetic events that have been reported for human CLL affirming the power and validity of this mouse model to study early epigenetic events in cancer progression Epigenetic alterations are detected as early as three months after birth far before disease manifests at about 11 months of age These mice undergo NFkappaB repressor complex mediated inactivation of the transcription factor Foxd3 whose targets become aberrantly methylated and silenced in mouse and human CLL Overall our data suggest the accumulated epigenetic alterations during CLL pathogenesis as a consequence of gene silencing through TCL1 and NFkappaB repressor complex suggesting the relevance for NFkappaB as a therapeutic target in CLL,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[191, 1153, 4, 3, 193, 1, 442, 1193, 552, 47, 44, 85, 1443, 2615, 520, 6, 3, 4985, 6, 45, 295, 132, 37, 4375, 5841, 6, 1392, 4, 1732, 6, 223, 225, 191, 281, 1, 5661, 21, 47, 95, 8, 149, 635, 830, 202, 9, 552, 252, 55, 1, 171, 8979, 8, 440, 552, 1836, 4, 1471, 132, 37, 1940, 6, 3, 193, 1, 2908, 3158, 6349, 2852, 1946, 5, 8, 34, 1005, 288, 6, 17, 527, 4, 171, 552, 1986, 21, 206, 114, 435, 45, 75, 26, 8979, 1621, 830, 202, 9, 552, 2, 1734, 171, 552, 347, 4, 8, 1383, 2915, 25048, 353, 6, 1539, 3, 1972, 2, 2088, 1, 1418, 281, 1821, 190, 5661, 21, 264, 17, 3, 830, 202, 11076, 3, 1418, 281, 17, 47, 85, 210, 9, 171, 552, 31541, 3, 2349, 2, 3099, 1, 26, 830, 202, 6, 45, 191, 1418, 281, 4, 12, 91, 1418, 593, 32, 530, 22, 191, 22, 169, 53, 50, 3809, 3272, 348, 34, 15096, 28, 545, 175, 53, 1, 89, 46, 399, 1251, 6469, 7434, 840, 517, 2297, 1, 3, 866, 161, 18573, 1310, 637, 1417, 5619, 2963, 2, 5442, 4, 830, 2, 171, 552, 63, 114, 74, 309, 3, 6664, 1418, 593, 190, 552, 1384, 22, 8, 4177, 1, 145, 2077, 298, 8979, 2, 6469, 7434, 840, 802, 3, 2088, 9, 6469, 22, 8, 189, 283, 4, 552]",1462.0,19901553,379
Lenalidomide treatment promotes CD154 expression on CLL cells and enhances production of antibodies by normal B cells through a PI3-kinase-dependent pathway.,Blood,Blood,2009-11-24,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) involves a profound humoral immune defect and tumor-specific humoral tolerance that directly contribute to disease morbidity and mortality. CD154 gene therapy can reverse this immune defect, but attempts to do this pharmacologically have been unsuccessful. The immune-modulatory agent lenalidomide shows clinical activity in CLL, but its mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that lenalidomide induces expression of functional CD154 antigen on CLL cells both in vitro and in vivo. This occurs via enhanced CD154 transcription mediated by a Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells c1 (NFATc1)/Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) complex and also through phosphoinositide-3 (PI3)-kinase pathway-dependent stabilization of CD154 mRNA. Importantly, CD154-positive CLL cells up-regulate BID, DR5, and p73, become sensitized to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis, and promote costimulatory activation of normal B cells to produce antibodies. In CLL patients receiving lenalidomide, similar evidence of CD154 activation is observed including BID, DR5, and p73 induction and also development of anti-ROR1 tumor-directed antibodies. Our data demonstrate that lenalidomide promotes CD154 expression on CLL cells with subsequent activation phenotype, and may therefore reverse the humoral immune defect observed in this disease.

CD19 targeting of chronic lymphocytic leukemia with a novel Fc-domain-engineered monoclonal antibody.,Blood,Blood,2009-12-02,"CD19 is a B cell-specific antigen expressed on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells but to date has not been effectively targeted with therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. XmAb5574 is a novel engineered anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody with a modified constant fragment (Fc)-domain designed to enhance binding of FcgammaRIIIa. Herein, we demonstrate that XmAb5574 mediates potent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), modest direct cytotoxicity, and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis but not complement-mediated cytotoxicity against CLL cells. Interestingly, XmAb5574 mediates significantly higher ADCC compared with both the humanized anti-CD19 nonengineered antibody it is derived from and also rituximab, a therapeutic antibody widely used in the treatment of CLL. The XmAb5574-dependent ADCC is mediated by natural killer (NK) cells through a granzyme B-dependent mechanism. The NK cell-mediated cytolytic and secretory function with XmAb5574 compared with the nonengineered antibody is associated with enhanced NK-cell activation, interferon production, extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation downstream of Fcgamma receptor, and no increased NK-cell apoptosis. Notably, enhanced NK cell-mediated ADCC with XmAb5574 was enhanced further by lenalidomide.

Predicting clinical outcome in CLL: how and why.,Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,2009-01-01,"The clinical course of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is heterogeneous, with some patients experiencing rapid disease progression and others living for decades without requiring treatment. Clinical features and molecular/biologic factors such as ZAP-70, immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGHV) gene mutation status, and cytogenetic abnormalities on fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) have been found to be robust predictors of treatment-free survival and overall survival among newly diagnosed patients. Beyond their widely recognized value for providing insight into disease biology and utility for stratifying patient risk in clinical trials, these prognostic tools play an important role in the current counseling and management of patients with CLL. Recent studies have focused on how to combine the results of multiple prognostic assays into an integrated risk stratification system and explored how these characteristics influence response to treatment.

Thalidomide and lenalidomide as new therapeutics for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2010-01-01,"The use of nucleoside analog-based chemo-immunotherapeutic regimens over the last decade has significantly improved outcomes in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Nonetheless, virtually all patients with CLL relapse from chemoimmmunotherapy and current available therapies are not curative. Identifying therapies that effectively eliminate CLL cells and lack immunesuppression represent an exciting new therapeutic approach. IMiDs are a class of immunomodulating drugs that increase T-cell and NK-cell directed killing of tumor cells. The first generation molecule is thalidomide followed by a second generation molecule lenalidomide that lacks neurotoxicity and is being explored more extensively in clinical trials. Lenalidomide has been shown to benefit patients with multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes, and lymphoma. Initial reports in patients with relapsed and refractory CLL have shown promising responses. In a subset of patients with CLL complete responses have been noted. Subsequent studies, however, have suggested that this class of drug can also have serious and potentially life-threatening side effects including myelosuppression, tumor flare reaction and in a small subset of patients tumor lysis syndrome. Tumor flare with both thalidomide and lenalidomide appear to be disease specific to CLL and may reflect clinical manifestation of CLL tumor cell activation.

Differential effects of IL-2 and IL-21 on expansion of the CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ T regulatory cells with redundant roles in natural killer cell mediated antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,mAbs,MAbs,2010-01-08,"CD4(+) CD25(+) regulatory T cells are expanded in solid and hematological malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Several cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules are required for generation, survival and maintenance of their suppressive effect. We and others have shown direct cytotoxic effect of the novel common gamma chain cytokine interleukin (IL)-21 on primary B cells from CLL patients. Since members of this family of cytokines are known to exhibit their effects on diverse immune cells, we have examined the effects of IL-21 on CLL patient derived regulatory T cell (Treg) induction, expansion and the inhibitory effect on natural killer cells in vitro. We demonstrate here the expression of IL-21 receptor in CD4(+)CD25(High) regulatory cells from CLL patients. In contrast to IL-2, the IL-21 cytokine failed to mediate expansion of regulatory T cells or induced expression of Foxp3 in CD4(+)CD25(Intermediate) or CD4(+)CD25(Dim/-) T cells in whole blood derived from CLL patients. Interestingly, in contrast to their differential effects on expansion of the CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)T cells, IL-2 and IL-21 exhibited a redundant role in Treg mediated suppression of NK cell mediated antibody dependent cytotoxicity function.

We sought to elucidate the antigenic basis of the effective graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) responses associated with DLI for the treatment of CLL by analyzing the specificity of plasma antibody responses developing in two DLI-treated patients who achieved long-term remission without graft-versus-host disease. By probing high-density protein microarrays with patient plasma, we discovered 35 predominantly intracellular antigens that elicited high-titer antibody reactivity greater in post-DLI than in pre-DLI plasma. Three antigens-C6orf130, MDS032, and ZFYVE19-were identified by both patients. Along with additional candidate antigens DAPK3, SERBP1, and OGFOD1, these proteins showed higher transcript and protein expression in B cells and CLL cells compared with normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. DAPK3 and the shared antigens do not represent minor histocompatibility antigens, as their sequences are identical in both donor and tumor. Although ZFYVE19, DAPK3, and OGFOD1 elicited minimal antibody reactivity in 12 normal subjects and 12 chemotherapy-treated CLL patients, 5 of 12 CLL patients with clinical GvL responses were serologically reactive to these antigens.

"STAT3 is constitutively phosphorylated on serine 727 residues, binds DNA, and activates transcription in CLL cells.",Blood,Blood,2010-02-12,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in the Western hemisphere, but its pathogenesis is still poorly understood. Constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation (p) of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 occurs in several solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. In CLL, however, STAT3 is constitutively phosphorylated on serine 727, not tyrosine 705, residues. Because the biologic significance of serine pSTAT3 in CLL is not known, we studied peripheral blood cells of 106 patients with CLL and found that, although tyrosine pSTAT3 was inducible, serine pSTAT3 was constitutive in all patients studied, regardless of blood count, disease stage, or treatment status. In addition, we demonstrated that constitutive serine pSTAT3 translocates to the nucleus by the karyopherin-beta nucleocytoplasmic system and binds DNA. Dephosphorylation of inducible tyrosine pSTAT3 did not affect STAT3-DNA binding, suggesting that constitutive serine pSTAT3 binds DNA. Furthermore, infection of CLL cells with lentiviral STAT3-small hairpin RNA reduced the expression of several STAT3-regulated survival and proliferation genes and induced apoptosis, suggesting that constitutive serine pSTAT3 initiates transcription in CLL cells. Taken together, our data suggest that constitutive phosphorylation of STAT3 on serine 727 residues is a hallmark of CLL and that STAT3 be considered a therapeutic target in this disease.",Journal Article,3630.0,,Chronic lymphocytic CLL is the most common in the Western hemisphere but its pathogenesis is still poorly understood Constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation p of signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT 3 occurs in several solid tumors and hematologic malignancies In CLL however STAT3 is constitutively phosphorylated on serine 727 not tyrosine 705 residues Because the biologic significance of serine pSTAT3 in CLL is not known we studied peripheral blood cells of 106 patients with CLL and found that although tyrosine pSTAT3 was inducible serine pSTAT3 was constitutive in all patients studied regardless of blood count disease stage or treatment status In addition we demonstrated that constitutive serine pSTAT3 translocates to the nucleus by the karyopherin-beta nucleocytoplasmic system and binds DNA Dephosphorylation of inducible tyrosine pSTAT3 did not affect STAT3-DNA binding suggesting that constitutive serine pSTAT3 binds DNA Furthermore infection of CLL cells with lentiviral STAT3-small hairpin RNA reduced the expression of several STAT3-regulated survival and proliferation genes and induced apoptosis suggesting that constitutive serine pSTAT3 initiates transcription in CLL cells Taken together our data suggest that constitutive phosphorylation of STAT3 on serine 727 residues is a hallmark of CLL and that STAT3 be considered a therapeutic target in this disease,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[442, 1193, 552, 16, 3, 96, 186, 4, 3, 1521, 12741, 84, 211, 1384, 16, 1234, 1240, 1784, 3178, 564, 982, 19, 1, 1235, 5182, 2, 3393, 1, 866, 4168, 27, 1780, 4, 392, 537, 57, 2, 813, 441, 4, 552, 137, 1439, 16, 2818, 2365, 23, 3734, 14093, 44, 564, 11303, 6418, 408, 3, 1283, 724, 1, 3734, 6480, 4, 552, 16, 44, 440, 21, 656, 672, 315, 37, 1, 3251, 7, 5, 552, 2, 204, 17, 242, 564, 6480, 10, 2877, 3734, 6480, 10, 3178, 4, 62, 7, 656, 1583, 1, 315, 1276, 34, 82, 15, 24, 156, 4, 352, 21, 264, 17, 3178, 3734, 6480, 22560, 6, 3, 4262, 20, 3, 34838, 1090, 26914, 398, 2, 3333, 261, 7849, 1, 2877, 564, 6480, 205, 44, 1158, 1439, 261, 791, 802, 17, 3178, 3734, 6480, 3333, 261, 798, 930, 1, 552, 37, 5, 7823, 1439, 302, 5957, 893, 405, 3, 55, 1, 392, 1439, 1065, 25, 2, 457, 214, 2, 277, 351, 802, 17, 3178, 3734, 6480, 11935, 866, 4, 552, 37, 1633, 1162, 114, 74, 309, 17, 3178, 982, 1, 1439, 23, 3734, 14093, 6418, 16, 8, 4683, 1, 552, 2, 17, 1439, 40, 515, 8, 189, 283, 4, 26, 34]",1397.0,20154216,407
The treatment of recurrent/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) with everolimus results in clinical responses and mobilization of CLL cells into the circulation.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-05-01,"Patients with recurrent/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) often have chemotherapy-resistant disease, resulting in poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to learn if inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) would produce tumor responses. This was a phase 2 study of oral single-agent everolimus (10 mg/day) for recurrent/refractory indolent lymphoid malignancies including CLL. Four of 22 patients with CLL (18%; 95% confidence interval, 5%-40%) achieved a partial remission to therapy. An unanticipated finding in this study was an increase in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) associated with a decrease in lymphadenopathy in 8 (36%) patients.

While both ATO and ascorbic acid mediate cytotoxicity in CLL B cells as single agents, the efficacy of ATO is enhanced by ascorbic acid. This effect is dependent on increased ROS accumulation, as pretreatment of B-CLL cells with a glutathione reducing buthionine sulfoximine or catalase inhibiting aminotriazole, enhanced ATO/ascorbic acid-mediated cytotoxicity. Pretreatment with reducing agents such as catalase, or thiol antioxidant, N-acetyl cysteine or GSH also abrogated ATO/ascorbic acid-mediated cytotoxicity.

Among the 33 patients enrolled, 82% were male, the median age was 65 years (9 patients were aged >or=70 years), and 64% were classified as having Rai stage III to IV disease. The OR rate was 76%, with 9 CRs (27%), 5 nodular partial responses, and 11 partial responses (PRs) reported.

Ofatumumab as single-agent CD20 immunotherapy in fludarabine-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J.

Ofatumumab (HuMax-CD20) is a human monoclonal antibody targeting a distinct small-loop epitope on the CD20 molecule. We conducted an international clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ofatumumab in patients with FA-ref and BF-ref CLL. Patients received eight weekly infusions of ofatumumab followed by four monthly infusions during a 24-week period (dose 1 = 300 mg; doses 2 to 12 = 2,000 mg); response by an independent review committee (1996 National Cancer Institute Working Group criteria) was assessed every 4 weeks until week 24 and then every 3 months until month 24. This planned interim analysis included 138 treated patients with FA-ref (n = 59) and BF-ref (n = 79) CLL. The overall response rates (primary end point) were 58% [corrected] and 47% in the FA-ref and BF-ref groups, respectively. Complete resolution of constitutional symptoms and improved performance status occurred in 57% and 48% of patients, respectively. Median progression-free survival and overall survival times were 5.7 and 13.7 months in the FA-ref group, respectively, and 5.9 and 15.4 months in the BF-ref group, respectively.

Alemtuzumab by continuous intravenous infusion followed by subcutaneous injection plus rituximab in the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia recurrence.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-05-01,"Monoclonal antibodies may be used more effectively in combination. A previous study of intravenous (iv) bolus alemtuzumab plus rituximab in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) recurrence produced a response rate of 54% after a 4-week treatment period. To optimize dose, schedule, and route of alemtuzumab, a study was designed exploring continuous intravenous infusion (civ) followed by subcutaneous (sc) alemtuzumab together with weekly iv rituximab in patients with previously treated CLL. Data from 40 patients with a median age of 59 years, and a median of 3 prior regimens (range, 1-8 regimens) were evaluable. Approximately 64% of patients were fludarabine-refractory. Seven patients (18%) achieved a complete response (CR), 4 (10%) a nodular partial response (nPR), and 10 (25%) a partial response for an overall response rate of 53%. Of 11 major responses (CR, nPR), 8 occurred after cycle 1. Response rates were highest in blood (94%), followed by liver/spleen (82%), bone marrow (68%), and lymph nodes (51%). The combination did not generate unexpected toxicities. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivations occurred in 6 patients (15%) and responded well to anti-CMV therapy.

Rituximab in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Seminars in hematology,Semin. Hematol.,2010-04-01,"Rituximab is a class I chimeric anti-CD20 antibody that has shown efficacy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), both as a single agent and in combination with traditional chemotherapies. The modest activity demonstrated in early studies evaluating rituximab in relapsed CLL was improved with higher doses or more dose-intensive regimens that overcame the unfavorable pharmacokinetic features commonly found in CLL. These studies led to a variety of combination trials of rituximab with chemotherapy, where both phase II and later phase III studies have shown great promise for the advancement of CLL therapy. Despite the therapeutic success of rituximab in CLL, studies demonstrating the definitive relative mechanism of tumor clearance are still lacking and this requires further investigation. In addition to being used as a therapy for CLL, rituximab is an effective treatment for autoimmune CLL complications such as hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Patients with CLL may experience early infusion-related side effects that can be diminished with corticosteroid pretreatment and stepped-up dosing. Risk factors for infusion-related toxicity may relate to atypical CLL expressing bright CD20 antigen expression, although several different studies have not clearly implicated elevated white blood cell count as a risk factor.

17-DMAG targets the nuclear factor-kappaB family of proteins to induce apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: clinical implications of HSP90 inhibition.,Blood,Blood,2010-03-29,"The HSP90 client chaperone interaction stabilizes several important enzymes and antiapoptotic proteins, and pharmacologic inhibition of HSP90 results in rapid client protein degradation. Therefore, HSP90 inhibition is an attractive therapeutic approach when this protein is active, a phenotype commonly observed in transformed but not normal cells. However, preclinical studies with HSP90 inhibitors such as 17-AAG demonstrated depletion of only a subset of client proteins and very modest tumor cytotoxicity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. Herein, we describe another HSP90 inhibitor, 17-DMAG, which is cytotoxic to CLL but not normal lymphocytes. Treatment with 17-DMAG leads to depletion of the HSP90 client protein IKK, resulting in diminished NF-kappaB p50/p65 DNA binding, decreased NF-kappaB target gene transcription, and caspase-dependent apoptosis.

Influence of bone marrow stromal microenvironment on forodesine-induced responses in CLL primary cells.,Blood,Blood,2010-05-04,"Forodesine, a purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibitor, displays in vitro activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells in presence of dGuo, which is the basis for an ongoing clinical trial in patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL. Initial clinical data indicate forodesine has significant activity on circulating CLL cells, but less activity in clearing CLL cells from tissues such as marrow. In tissue microenvironments, lymphocytes interact with accessory stromal cells that provide survival and drug-resistance signals, which may account for residual disease. Therefore, we investigated the impact of marrow stromal cells (MSCs) on forodesine-induced response in CLL lymphocytes. We demonstrate that spontaneous and forodesine-induced apoptosis of CLL cells was significantly inhibited by human and murine MSCs. Forodesine-promoted dGuo triphosphate (dGTP) accumulation and GTP and ATP depletion in CLL cells was inhibited by MSCs, providing a mechanism for resistance.

We conducted a phase I dose escalation trial of single-agent flavopiridol in adults with relapsed/refractory acute leukemias, utilizing a modification of the intravenous bolus/continuous intravenous infusion approach, intensifying treatment for administration on days 1, 2, and 3 of 21-day cycles. Twenty-four adults with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (n=19) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=5) were enrolled. The median age was 62 years (range, 23-78). The maximum tolerated dose of flavopiridol was 40 mg/m(2) intravenous bolus plus 60 mg/m(2) continuous intravenous infusion (40/60). The dose limiting toxicity was secretory diarrhea. Life-threatening hyperacute tumor lysis syndrome requiring hemodialysis on day 1 was observed in one patient. Pharmacokinetics were dose-dependent with increased clearance observed at the two highest dose levels. Diarrhea occurrence and severity significantly correlated with flavopiridol concentrations at the end of the 4-hour infusion, volume of distribution, and elimination half-life. Modest anti-leukemic activity was observed, with most patients experiencing dramatic but transient reduction/clearance of circulating blasts lasting for 10-14 days. One refractory acute myeloid leukemia patient had short-lived complete remission with incomplete count recovery.

Clin. Oncol.,2010-05-17,"SNS-032 is a highly selective and potent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) 2, 7, and 9, with in vitro growth inhibitory effects and ability to induce apoptosis in malignant B cells. A phase I dose-escalation study of SNS-032 was conducted to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, biomarkers of mechanism-based pharmacodynamic (PD) activity, and clinical efficacy. Parallel cohorts of previously treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and multiple myeloma (MM) received SNS-032 as a loading dose followed by 6-hour infusion weekly for 3 weeks of each 4-week course. There were 19 patients with CLL and 18 with MM treated. Tumor lysis syndrome was the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) for CLL, the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was 75 mg/m(2), and the most frequent grade 3 to 4 toxicity was myelosuppression. One patient with CLL had more than 50% reduction in measurable disease without improvement in hematologic parameters. Another patient with low tumor burden had stable disease for four courses. For patients with MM, no DLT was observed and MTD was not identified at up to 75 mg/m(2), owing to early study closure. Two patients with MM had stable disease and one had normalization of spleen size with treatment. Biomarker analyses demonstrated mechanism-based PD activity with inhibition of Cdk7 and Cdk9, decreases in Mcl-1 and XIAP expression level, and associated CLL cell apoptosis. SNS-032 demonstrated mechanism-based target modulation and limited clinical activity in heavily pretreated patients with CLL and MM.

Many loci were either methylated or unmethylated across all CD38 levels, but differential methylation was also observed for some genes. Genomic sequencing of DLEU7 confirmed extensive cytosine methylation preferentially in patient samples with low CD38 expression, whereas NRP2, SFRP2 and ADAM12 were more commonly methylated in those with high CD38 expression. This study demonstrates that CLL is affected by CpG island methylation in some genes that segregate with CD38 expression levels, while most others show similar methylation patterns across all levels. The CpG island methylation in certain functional gene groups and pathway-associated genes that are known to be deregulated in CLL provides additional insights into the CLL methylome and epigenetic contribution to cellular dysfunction. It will now be useful to investigate the effectiveness of epigenetic therapeutic reversal of these alterations to develop effective treatments for the disease.",Journal Article,3764.0,40.0,B-cell chronic lymphocytic CLL is a heterogeneous malignancy that clinically ranges from indolent to rapidly progressive CLL like other cancers can be affected by epigenetic alterations A microarray discovery-based study was initiated to determine DNA methylation in CLL cases with a range of CD38 expression 1–92 Many loci were either methylated or unmethylated across all CD38 levels but differential methylation was also observed for some genes Genomic sequencing of DLEU7 confirmed extensive cytosine methylation preferentially in patient samples with low CD38 expression whereas NRP2 SFRP2 and ADAM12 were more commonly methylated in those with high CD38 expression This study demonstrates that CLL is affected by CpG island methylation in some genes that segregate with CD38 expression levels while most others show similar methylation patterns across all levels The CpG island methylation in certain functional gene groups and pathway-associated genes that are known to be deregulated in CLL provides additional insights into the CLL methylome and epigenetic contribution to cellular dysfunction It will now be useful to investigate the effectiveness of epigenetic therapeutic reversal of these alterations to develop effective treatments for the disease,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[132, 31, 442, 1193, 552, 16, 8, 1564, 710, 17, 505, 5632, 29, 2316, 6, 1755, 1014, 552, 733, 127, 163, 122, 40, 1424, 20, 1418, 593, 8, 1727, 1574, 90, 45, 10, 1917, 6, 223, 261, 569, 4, 552, 140, 5, 8, 184, 1, 4469, 55, 58994, 445, 2012, 11, 361, 2963, 15, 8100, 716, 62, 4469, 148, 84, 1777, 569, 10, 120, 164, 9, 476, 214, 572, 615, 1, 58995, 557, 1344, 6903, 569, 3509, 4, 69, 347, 5, 154, 4469, 55, 547, 18537, 16882, 2, 34901, 11, 80, 841, 2963, 4, 135, 5, 64, 4469, 55, 26, 45, 1902, 17, 552, 16, 1424, 20, 2075, 3454, 569, 4, 476, 214, 17, 13258, 5, 4469, 55, 148, 369, 96, 1749, 514, 288, 569, 764, 716, 62, 148, 3, 2075, 3454, 569, 4, 1840, 583, 145, 271, 2, 308, 41, 214, 17, 32, 440, 6, 40, 5415, 4, 552, 777, 402, 1957, 237, 3, 552, 11362, 2, 1418, 2925, 6, 763, 1527, 192, 303, 1134, 40, 999, 6, 963, 3, 1236, 1, 1418, 189, 5933, 1, 46, 593, 6, 690, 323, 640, 9, 3, 34]",1261.0,20495622,359

Other studies have suggested that statins reduce the efficacy of rituximab by inhibiting binding to CD20. We therefore conducted an observational cohort study of 686 patients with newly diagnosed Rai stage 0 CLL to evaluate whether statin or NSAID use was related to their clinical outcome or influenced the efficacy of rituximab therapy. At diagnosis, 136 (20%) patients took statins and 230 (34%) scheduled daily aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen. No difference in time to treatment was observed based on statin or NSAID use. Among patients receiving a rituximab-containing first-line therapy, no difference in time to salvage treatment was observed based on statin use. Although previous studies suggested statins may improve event free survival among patients with follicular lymphoma, we find no impact of statins on time to initial therapy in this large study of patients with Rai stage 0 CLL.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-δ inhibitor CAL-101 shows promising preclinical activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia by antagonizing intrinsic and extrinsic cellular survival signals.,Blood,Blood,2010-06-03,"Targeted therapy with imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) prompted a new treatment paradigm. Unlike CML, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) lacks an aberrant fusion protein kinase but instead displays increased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity. To date, PI3K inhibitor development has been limited because of the requirement of this pathway for many essential cellular functions. Identification of the hematopoietic-selective isoform PI3K-δ unlocks a new therapeutic potential for B-cell malignancies. Herein, we demonstrate that PI3K has increased enzymatic activity and that PI3K-δ is expressed in CLL cells. A PI3K-δ selective inhibitor CAL-101 promoted apoptosis in primary CLL cells ex vivo in a dose- and time-dependent fashion that was independent of common prognostic markers. CAL-101-mediated cytotoxicity was caspase dependent and was not diminished by coculture on stromal cells. In addition, CAL-101 abrogated protection from spontaneous apoptosis induced by B cell-activating factors CD40L, TNF-α, and fibronectin. In contrast to malignant cells, CAL-101 does not promote apoptosis in normal T cells or natural killer cells, nor does it diminish antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. However, CAL-101 did decrease activated T-cell production of various inflammatory and antiapoptotic cytokines. Collectively, these studies provide rationale for the clinical development of CAL-101 as a first-in-class targeted therapy for CLL and related B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.",Journal Article,3519.0,400.0,Targeted therapy with imatinib in chronic myeloid CML prompted a new treatment paradigm Unlike CML chronic lymphocytic CLL lacks an aberrant fusion protein kinase but instead displays increased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase PI3K activity To date PI3K inhibitor development has been limited because of the requirement of this pathway for many essential cellular functions Identification of the hematopoietic-selective isoform PI3K-δ unlocks a new therapeutic potential for B-cell malignancies Herein we demonstrate that PI3K has increased enzymatic activity and that PI3K-δ is expressed in CLL cells A PI3K-δ selective inhibitor CAL-101 promoted apoptosis in primary CLL cells ex vivo in a dose- and time-dependent fashion that was independent of common prognostic markers CAL-101-mediated cytotoxicity was caspase dependent and was not diminished by coculture on stromal cells In addition CAL-101 abrogated protection from spontaneous apoptosis induced by B cell-activating factors CD40L TNF-α and fibronectin In contrast to malignant cells CAL-101 does not promote apoptosis in normal T cells or natural killer cells nor does it diminish antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity However CAL-101 did decrease activated T-cell production of various inflammatory and antiapoptotic cytokines Collectively these studies provide rationale for the clinical development of CAL-101 as a first-in-class targeted therapy for CLL and related B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[238, 36, 5, 577, 4, 442, 533, 903, 4140, 8, 217, 24, 2431, 4246, 903, 442, 1193, 552, 6856, 35, 1898, 1212, 178, 216, 84, 3496, 7196, 101, 3415, 27, 216, 974, 128, 6, 1244, 974, 230, 193, 71, 85, 383, 408, 1, 3, 4701, 1, 26, 308, 9, 445, 1452, 763, 1681, 911, 1, 3, 1007, 1094, 3995, 974, 7339, 59029, 8, 217, 189, 174, 9, 132, 31, 441, 1986, 21, 608, 17, 974, 71, 101, 5226, 128, 2, 17, 974, 7339, 16, 570, 4, 552, 37, 8, 974, 7339, 1094, 230, 10368, 2338, 2992, 351, 4, 86, 552, 37, 2581, 386, 4, 8, 61, 2, 98, 470, 3240, 17, 10, 306, 1, 186, 177, 525, 10368, 2338, 517, 1408, 10, 1469, 470, 2, 10, 44, 2849, 20, 7604, 23, 1126, 37, 4, 352, 10368, 2338, 3728, 3525, 29, 3280, 351, 277, 20, 132, 31, 1616, 130, 8285, 2254, 2014, 2, 8629, 4, 748, 6, 393, 37, 10368, 2338, 1097, 44, 1617, 351, 4, 295, 102, 37, 15, 1504, 3458, 37, 2110, 1097, 192, 8440, 548, 470, 763, 1408, 137, 10368, 2338, 205, 775, 735, 102, 31, 1529, 1, 747, 1291, 2, 4176, 1886, 2535, 46, 94, 377, 1728, 9, 3, 38, 193, 1, 10368, 2338, 22, 8, 157, 4, 1040, 238, 36, 9, 552, 2, 139, 132, 31, 4192, 1997]",1467.0,20522708,398

Treatment with some monoclonal antibodies is often complicated by infusion-related adverse events and increased risk of infections. Several novel agents are currently being investigated for this difficult-to-treat patient population. Ofatumumab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that targets a different epitope from the one targeted by rituximab and, it has shown promising antileukemia activity. Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent that has shown promising activity in patients with fludarabine-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia, many of whom had poor prognostic features and bulky disease.

Age at diagnosis and the utility of prognostic testing in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-10-01,"A study was undertaken to analyze the survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients relative to age-matched individuals in the general population and determine the age-stratified utility of prognostic testing. All 2487 patients diagnosed with CLL between January 1995 and June 2008 and cared for in the Mayo Clinic Division of Hematology were categorized by age at diagnosis and evaluated for differences in clinical characteristics, time to first treatment, and overall survival (OS). Among Rai stage 0 patients, survival was shorter than the age-matched general population for patients aged <55 years (P < .001), 55 to 64 years (P < .001), and 65 to 74 years (P < .001), but not those aged ≥75 years at diagnosis (P = not significant). CD38, IGHV mutation, and ZAP-70 each predicted time to first treatment independent of stage for all age groups (all P < .04), but had less value for predicting OS, particularly as age increased. IGHV and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) predicted OS independent of stage for patients aged <55 years (P ≤ .001), 55 to 64 years (P ≤ .004), and 65 to 74 years (P ≤ .001), but not those aged ≥75 years. CD38 and ZAP-70 each predicted OS independent of stage for only 2 of 4 age categories. Among Rai 0 patients aged <75 years, survival was shorter than the age-matched population only for IGHV unmutated (P < .001) patients or those with unfavorable FISH (P < .001). Survival of CLL patients aged <75 years is shorter than the age-matched general population regardless of disease stage. Among patients aged <75 years, the simple combinations of stage and IGHV or stage and FISH identifies those with excess risk of death relative to the age-matched population.

LEF-1 is a prosurvival factor in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and is expressed in the preleukemic state of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis.,Blood,Blood,2010-07-01,"The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is pathogenic in a variety of cancers. We previously identified aberrant expression of the Wnt pathway transcription factor and target gene lymphoid enhancer binding factor-1 (LEF1) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This suggested that the Wnt signaling pathway has a role in the biology of CLL. In this study, we performed a Wnt pathway analysis using gene expression profiling and identified aberrant regulation of Wnt pathway target genes, ligands, and signaling members in CLL cells. Furthermore, we identified aberrant protein expression of LEF-1 specifically in CLL but not in normal mature B-cell subsets or after B-cell activation. Using the T cell-specific transcription factor/LEF (TCF/LEF) dual luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrated constitutive Wnt pathway activation in CLL, although the pathway was inactive in normal peripheral B cells.

The clinical application of monoclonal antibodies in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2010-07-07,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) represents the most prevalent adult leukemia. Treatment with chemotherapy over the past 3 decades has been palliative. The introduction of therapeutic antibodies has increased the number of treatment options for this disease. Despite this increase, our true understanding of the mechanism of action of antibody therapy in CLL remains limited. Rituximab, a CD20 antibody, is currently widely used in combination-based strategies for both previously untreated symptomatic CLL and as salvage therapy. Recent data suggest that the addition of rituximab to fludarabine with or without cyclophosphamide prolongs survival in younger patients with CLL. Other improved CD20 antibodies with promising clinical activity, including ofatumumab and GA-101, are coming forward. Alemtuzumab, a CD52 antibody, likewise has demonstrated benefit in both symptomatic, previously untreated CLL and in patients with relapsed disease but has less selectivity. Development of other therapeutic antibodies targeting alternative B-cell-specific antigens in CLL has been less successful, although many promising candidate antibodies and/or small modular immune pharmaceuticals (SMIPs) are coming forward.

Immunohistochemical detection of ZAP70 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia predicts immunoglobulin heavy chain gene mutation status and time to progression.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2010-07-23,"Zeta-associated protein-70 (ZAP70) expression measured by flow cytometry has been proposed as a surrogate marker of the somatic mutation status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) genes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, attempts to implement this approach in clinical flow cytometry laboratories have been problematic; many commercially available antibodies give unreliable results. Assessment of ZAP70 protein expression by immunohistochemistry in chronic lymphocytic leukemia tissue sections is an easy, alternative approach, although lack of quantitation and subjective interpretation of results are potential pitfalls. In this study, we correlated ZAP70 protein expression, assessed by immunohistochemistry, with ZAP70 messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript expression, assessed by semi-quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay, with the somatic mutation status of the IGHV genes in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Expression of ZAP70 protein and mRNA transcripts correlated strongly (P=8.238 × 10(-12)). Expression of ZAP70 protein and mRNA transcripts also correlated strongly with the somatic mutation status of the IGHV genes (P=0.000071 and P=0.00076, respectively). Further, ZAP70 positivity by immunohistochemistry was associated with an increased risk of progression to therapy requirement (3-year risk 83% vs 31% for ZAP70 negative by immunohistochemistry, P=0.03). These results show that ZAP70 expression assessed by immunohistochemistry is a reliable surrogate marker of the somatic mutation status of the IGHV genes, and predicts time to progression.",Journal Article,3469.0,16.0,Zeta-associated protein-70 ZAP70 expression measured by flow cytometry has been proposed as a surrogate marker of the somatic mutation status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region IGHV genes in chronic lymphocytic However attempts to implement this approach in clinical flow cytometry laboratories have been problematic many commercially available antibodies give unreliable results Assessment of ZAP70 protein expression by immunohistochemistry in chronic lymphocytic tissue sections is an easy alternative approach although lack of quantitation and subjective interpretation of results are potential pitfalls In this study we correlated ZAP70 protein expression assessed by immunohistochemistry with ZAP70 messenger RNA mRNA transcript expression assessed by semi-quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay with the somatic mutation status of the IGHV genes in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic Expression of ZAP70 protein and mRNA transcripts correlated strongly P=8.238 10 -12 Expression of ZAP70 protein and mRNA transcripts also correlated strongly with the somatic mutation status of the IGHV genes P=0.000071 and P=0.00076 respectively Further ZAP70 positivity by immunohistochemistry was associated with an increased risk of progression to therapy requirement 3-year risk 83 vs 31 for ZAP70 negative by immunohistochemistry P=0.03 These results show that ZAP70 expression assessed by immunohistochemistry is a reliable surrogate marker of the somatic mutation status of the IGHV genes and predicts time to progression,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[12105, 41, 178, 431, 12921, 55, 644, 20, 1412, 1914, 71, 85, 1587, 22, 8, 2592, 952, 1, 3, 1119, 258, 156, 1, 3, 2593, 4013, 1260, 1347, 1053, 6220, 214, 4, 442, 1193, 137, 4374, 6, 6207, 26, 353, 4, 38, 1412, 1914, 4884, 47, 85, 6594, 445, 5262, 390, 890, 4978, 15198, 99, 455, 1, 12921, 178, 55, 20, 888, 4, 442, 1193, 246, 3013, 16, 35, 6261, 1091, 353, 242, 926, 1, 7887, 2, 5571, 3037, 1, 99, 32, 174, 9631, 4, 26, 45, 21, 438, 12921, 178, 55, 275, 20, 888, 5, 12921, 5992, 893, 956, 3268, 55, 275, 20, 6399, 1156, 1589, 98, 1772, 4456, 1451, 1260, 1329, 719, 5, 3, 1119, 258, 156, 1, 3, 6220, 214, 4, 373, 1278, 7, 5, 442, 1193, 55, 1, 12921, 178, 2, 956, 2680, 438, 1327, 19, 66, 6883, 79, 133, 55, 1, 12921, 178, 2, 956, 2680, 120, 438, 1327, 5, 3, 1119, 258, 156, 1, 3, 6220, 214, 19, 13, 59205, 2, 19, 13, 59206, 106, 195, 12921, 1887, 20, 888, 10, 41, 5, 35, 101, 43, 1, 91, 6, 36, 4701, 27, 111, 43, 852, 105, 456, 9, 12921, 199, 20, 888, 19, 13, 680, 46, 99, 514, 17, 12921, 55, 275, 20, 888, 16, 8, 2450, 2592, 952, 1, 3, 1119, 258, 156, 1, 3, 6220, 214, 2, 2623, 98, 6, 91]",1593.0,20657554,288

Three months after completion of FR, patients with stable disease or better response received subcutaneous alemtuzumab 3 mg day 1, 10 mg day 3, and 30 mg day 5 and then 30 mg three times per week for 5 weeks. Overall response (OR), complete response (CR), and partial response (PR) rates were 90%, 29%, and 61% after FR, respectively; 15% of patients were minimal residual disease (MRD) negative. Of 102 patients, 58 received alemtuzumab; 28 (61%) of 46 patients achieving PR after FR attained CR after alemtuzumab.

High serum thymidine kinase 1 level predicts poorer survival in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,American journal of clinical pathology,Am. J. Clin. Pathol.,2010-09-01,"Serum thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) levels have been reported to have prognostic significance in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Until recently, serum TK1 levels were assessed using inconvenient radioenzyme assays. In this study, we used a novel chemiluminescence assay to assess serum TK1 levels in patients with CLL at the time of first examination. We show that high serum TK1 levels predict poorer overall survival and correlate with unmutated immunoglobulin variable region genes, CD38 and ZAP-70 expression, and subsequent risk of developing large B-cell lymphoma (Richter syndrome). Similar findings were observed in a subset of patients treated with current fludarabine-based chemotherapy regimens.

"Self-administered, subcutaneous alemtuzumab to treat residual disease in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",Cancer,Cancer,2010-08-30,"Alemtuzumab is highly effective at treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in bone marrow, which is the usual site of residual disease after fludarabine-based treatment. Eliminating residual disease potentially is associated with longer remission and overall survival. The authors of this report evaluated the ability of subcutaneous alemtuzumab to treat residual disease. Patients in partial remission (PR), nodular PR (nPR), or complete remission (CR) who had disease in bone marrow established by 2-color flow cytometry analysis were enrolled and received alemtuzumab 30 mg subcutaneously 3 times weekly for 4 weeks, and patients had the option to self-administer alemtuzumab. Responders were patients in PR who converted to an nPR or a CR, patients in nPR who converted to a CR, and patients in CR who had no evidence of disease on 2-color flow cytometry analysis after treatment. There were 31 patients enrolled, of whom 29 were evaluable, and there were 23 responders (4 of 4 patients who achieved a CR, 8 of 9 patients who achieved an nPR, and 11 of 16 patients who achieved a PR. Nonresponders had significantly lower plasma alemtuzumab levels at the end of treatment. Furthermore, higher plasma alemtuzumab levels at the end of treatment were correlated with a longer response duration. Compared with the results from an historic group that received intravenous alemtuzumab for residual disease, there was a trend toward a higher response rate but a shorter response duration with subcutaneous alemtuzumab. The current results demonstrated that self-administered, subcutaneous alemtuzumab was safe and active for residual disease and that plasma alemtuzumab levels and real-time minimal residual disease evaluation are important endpoints to monitor in future alemtuzumab consolidation trials.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",3431.0,16.0,Alemtuzumab is highly effective at treating chronic lymphocytic CLL in marrow which is the usual site of residual disease after fludarabine-based treatment Eliminating residual disease potentially is associated with longer remission and overall survival The authors of this report evaluated the ability of subcutaneous alemtuzumab to treat residual disease Patients in partial remission PR nodular PR nPR or complete remission CR who had disease in marrow established by 2-color flow cytometry analysis were enrolled and received alemtuzumab 30 mg subcutaneously 3 times weekly for 4 weeks and patients had the option to self-administer alemtuzumab Responders were patients in PR who converted to an nPR or a CR patients in nPR who converted to a CR and patients in CR who had no evidence of disease on 2-color flow cytometry analysis after treatment There were 31 patients enrolled of whom 29 were evaluable and there were 23 responders 4 of 4 patients who achieved a CR 8 of 9 patients who achieved an nPR and 11 of 16 patients who achieved a PR Nonresponders had significantly lower plasma alemtuzumab levels at the end of treatment Furthermore higher plasma alemtuzumab levels at the end of treatment were correlated with a longer response duration Compared with the results from an historic group that received intravenous alemtuzumab for residual disease there was a trend toward a higher response rate but a shorter response duration with subcutaneous alemtuzumab The current results demonstrated that self-administered subcutaneous alemtuzumab was safe and active for residual disease and that plasma alemtuzumab levels and real-time minimal residual disease evaluation are important endpoints to monitor in future alemtuzumab consolidation trials,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[3579, 16, 561, 323, 28, 1367, 442, 1193, 552, 4, 581, 92, 16, 3, 3521, 606, 1, 753, 34, 50, 2027, 90, 24, 6923, 753, 34, 751, 16, 41, 5, 589, 734, 2, 63, 25, 3, 738, 1, 26, 414, 194, 3, 801, 1, 2529, 3579, 6, 943, 753, 34, 7, 4, 450, 734, 998, 4481, 998, 23816, 15, 236, 734, 684, 54, 42, 34, 4, 581, 635, 20, 18, 6052, 1412, 1914, 65, 11, 346, 2, 103, 3579, 201, 81, 3928, 27, 1072, 709, 9, 39, 244, 2, 7, 42, 3, 1501, 6, 1074, 6888, 3579, 1983, 11, 7, 4, 998, 54, 4764, 6, 35, 23816, 15, 8, 684, 7, 4, 23816, 54, 4764, 6, 8, 684, 2, 7, 4, 684, 54, 42, 77, 241, 1, 34, 23, 18, 6052, 1412, 1914, 65, 50, 24, 125, 11, 456, 7, 346, 1, 953, 462, 11, 859, 2, 125, 11, 382, 1983, 39, 1, 39, 7, 54, 513, 8, 684, 66, 1, 83, 7, 54, 513, 35, 23816, 2, 175, 1, 245, 7, 54, 513, 8, 998, 4498, 42, 97, 280, 554, 3579, 148, 28, 3, 396, 1, 24, 798, 142, 554, 3579, 148, 28, 3, 396, 1, 24, 11, 438, 5, 8, 589, 51, 654, 72, 5, 3, 99, 29, 35, 6875, 87, 17, 103, 1262, 3579, 9, 753, 34, 125, 10, 8, 853, 1317, 8, 142, 51, 116, 84, 8, 985, 51, 654, 5, 2529, 3579, 3, 291, 99, 264, 17, 1074, 468, 2529, 3579, 10, 1165, 2, 544, 9, 753, 34, 2, 17, 554, 3579, 148, 2, 1589, 98, 1048, 753, 34, 451, 32, 305, 1387, 6, 3334, 4, 508, 3579, 2173, 143]",1755.0,20806349,389

Clin. Oncol.,2010-09-13,"Despite high initial remission rates, most lymphomas relapse and require further therapy. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a validated target in mantle cell lymphoma, but has not been extensively evaluated in other lymphomas. We performed a phase II trial of single-agent temsirolimus 25-mg weekly in patients with relapsed aggressive and indolent lymphomas. The primary objective was overall and complete response rate. Patients were stratified by histology: group A (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, transformed follicular lymphoma), group B (follicular lymphoma), and group C (chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, and other indolent lymphomas). Eighty-nine patients were treated, with outcome strongly dependent on histology. Group A had an overall and complete response rate of 28.1% and 12.5%, respectively, and median progression-free survival (PFS) of 2.6 months and median overall survival (OS) of 7.2 months. Group B had overall and complete response rates of 53.8% and 25.6%, respectively, and median PFS of 12.7 months; median OS has not yet been reached. Group C had a partial response rate of 11% with no complete responders. Toxicity was mainly mild and/or reversible myelosuppression and mucositis; however, four patients developed pneumonitis. Single-agent temsirolimus has significant activity in both diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, although the durability of responses and PFS are longer for patients with follicular lymphoma.

"A dose-finding, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of a novel schedule of flavopiridol in patients with advanced solid tumors.",Investigational new drugs,Invest New Drugs,2010-10-12,"Based on the promising activity and tolerability of flavopiridol administered with a pharmacokinetically-derived dosing schedule in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we conducted a phase I study using this schedule in patients with advanced solid tumors. Flavopiridol was given IV as a 30-min loading dose followed by a 4-hr infusion weekly for 4 weeks repeated every 6 weeks. Dose-escalation was in cohorts of three patients using the standard 3+3 phase I study design. Blood samples were obtained for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies. Thirty-four eligible patients with advanced solid tumors received a total of 208 doses (median 7, range 1-24). Total doses ranged from 40 to 105 mg/m(2). The primary dose limiting toxicity was cytokine release syndrome (CKRS). No antitumor responses were observed. The mean peak plasma concentration across all doses was 1.65 ± 0.86 μM. Area under the concentration-versus-time curve ([Formula: see text]) ranged from 4.31 to 32.2 μM[Symbol: see text]hr with an overall mean of 13.6 ± 7.0 μM[Symbol: see text]hr.

Homoharringtonine reduced Mcl-1 expression and induced apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2010-10-22,"Homoharringtonine (HHT) is a plant alkaloid that inhibits the elongation phase of translation that is currently in clinical trials. Because the intrinsically short-lived antiapoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) has been reported to support the survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, we hypothesized that inhibition of protein synthesis by HHT would decrease Mcl-1 expression and induce apoptosis in CLL. In primary CLL cells, HHT induced significant apoptosis independent of the prognostic characteristics of the patients. This was associated with inhibition of translation and decreased Mcl-1 levels in CLL cells. Mcl-1 reduction was evident as early as 2 hours and continued to decrease in the next 6-8 hours, whereas cell death started in 2 hours and continued to increase for 24 hours. Reduction of the Mcl-1 level was due to translation inhibition and proteasome degradation rather than to transcription inhibition or caspase cleavage. HHT and the transcription inhibitor SNS-032 induced synergistic cell killing. Although stromal cells induced Mcl-1 expression and protected CLL cells from the toxicity of fludarabine, this induction was reversed by HHT, which overcame stromal cell-mediated protection. Thus, these results provide a rationale for clinical development of HHT in CLL as single agent or in combinations.",Journal Article,3378.0,54.0,Homoharringtonine HHT is a plant alkaloid that inhibits the elongation phase of translation that is currently in clinical trials Because the intrinsically short-lived antiapoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia-1 Mcl-1 has been reported to support the survival of chronic lymphocytic CLL cells we hypothesized that inhibition of protein synthesis by HHT would decrease Mcl-1 expression and induce apoptosis in CLL In primary CLL cells HHT induced significant apoptosis independent of the prognostic characteristics of the patients This was associated with inhibition of translation and decreased Mcl-1 levels in CLL cells Mcl-1 reduction was evident as early as 2 hours and continued to decrease in the next 6-8 hours whereas cell death started in 2 hours and continued to increase for 24 hours Reduction of the Mcl-1 level was due to translation inhibition and proteasome degradation rather than to transcription inhibition or caspase cleavage HHT and the transcription inhibitor SNS-032 induced synergistic cell killing Although stromal cells induced Mcl-1 expression and protected CLL cells from the toxicity of fludarabine this induction was reversed by HHT which overcame stromal cell-mediated protection Thus these results provide a rationale for clinical development of HHT in CLL as single agent or in combinations,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[18768, 9249, 16, 8, 9045, 12544, 17, 1576, 3, 12359, 124, 1, 2691, 17, 16, 694, 4, 38, 143, 408, 3, 9759, 978, 4813, 4176, 178, 533, 31, 2647, 14, 1308, 14, 71, 85, 210, 6, 538, 3, 25, 1, 442, 1193, 552, 37, 21, 1237, 17, 297, 1, 178, 2525, 20, 9249, 688, 775, 1308, 14, 55, 2, 1290, 351, 4, 552, 4, 86, 552, 37, 9249, 277, 93, 351, 306, 1, 3, 177, 374, 1, 3, 7, 26, 10, 41, 5, 297, 1, 2691, 2, 340, 1308, 14, 148, 4, 552, 37, 1308, 14, 628, 10, 2853, 22, 191, 22, 18, 1459, 2, 1351, 6, 775, 4, 3, 1305, 49, 66, 1459, 547, 31, 273, 3461, 4, 18, 1459, 2, 1351, 6, 344, 9, 259, 1459, 628, 1, 3, 1308, 14, 301, 10, 520, 6, 2691, 297, 2, 1694, 2373, 1832, 76, 6, 866, 297, 15, 1469, 3155, 9249, 2, 3, 866, 230, 7323, 4708, 277, 1806, 31, 3003, 242, 1126, 37, 277, 1308, 14, 55, 2, 5541, 552, 37, 29, 3, 155, 1, 2027, 26, 504, 10, 3682, 20, 9249, 92, 11097, 1126, 31, 517, 3525, 631, 46, 99, 377, 8, 1728, 9, 38, 193, 1, 9249, 4, 552, 22, 226, 420, 15, 4, 1247]",1322.0,20971952,277
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: new concepts for future therapy.,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2010-10-01,"Over the past several years, we have witnessed rapid advances in our understanding of the biology and treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). New prognostic factors have been characterized that help identify patients at high risk of rapid disease progression, refractoriness to treatment, and short overall survival (OS). These advances have led to a significant paradigm shift in the management of CLL. Novel therapeutic strategies, including combinations of monoclonal antibodies with conventional chemotherapy, have dramatically improved response rates, remission duration, and recently, OS. However, these benefits do not appear to extend to certain patient subsets, especially those with unfavorable clinical or cytogenetic risk factors. The majority of patients with CLL will invariably relapse following first-line therapy and can acquire high-risk genetic abnormalities. Repeated treatment leads to eventual therapeutic refractoriness and shortened survival compared with age-matched healthy individuals. Several novel agents and strategies, including next-generation anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, the alkylating agent bendamustine, the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol, and small-molecule Bcl2 inhibitors, are currently under clinical investigation as novel agents that will hopefully improve treatment outcomes for CLL. Though allogeneic stem cell transplantation offers curative potential, it also presents clinical challenges in terms of patient appropriateness, donor availability, and timing.

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2010-11-01,"Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) extends the curative potential of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to patients with hematologic malignancies unable to withstand myeloablative conditioning. We prospectively analyzed the outcomes of 123 patients (median age, 57 years; range, 23-70 years) with hematologic malignancies treated with a uniform RIC regimen of cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and total-body irradiation (200 cGy) with or without antithymocyte globulin followed by related donor allogeneic HCT at the University of Minnesota between 2002 and 2008. The cohort included 45 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 27 with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 8 with indolent NHL, 10 with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), 10 with myeloma, and 23 with acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, other leukemias, or myeloproliferative disorders. The probability of 4-year overall survival was 73% for patients with indolent NHL, 58% for those with aggressive NHL, 67% for those with HL, 30% for those with AML/MDS, and only 10% for those with myeloma. Corresponding outcomes for relapse in these patients were 0%, 32%, 50%, 33%, and 38%, and those for progression-free survival were 73%, 45%, 27%, 27%, and 10%. The incidence of treatment-related mortality was 14% at day +100 and 22% at 1 year. The incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease was 38% at day +100, and that of chronic graft-versus-host disease was 50% at 2 years. Multivariate analysis revealed superior overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with both indolent and aggressive NHL compared with those with AML/MDS, HL, or myeloma. Worse 1-year treatment-related mortality was observed in patients with a Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index score ≥ 3 and in cytomegalovirus-seropositive recipients. These results suggest that (1) RIC conditioning was well tolerated by an older, heavily pretreated population; (2) patients with indolent and aggressive NHL respond well to RIC conditioning, highlighting the importance of the graft-versus-lymphoma effect; and (3) additional peri-transplantation manipulations are needed to improve outcomes for patients with AML/MDS or myeloma receiving RIC conditioning before HCT.",Clinical Trial,3368.0,27.0,Reduced-intensity conditioning RIC extends the curative potential of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation HCT to patients with hematologic malignancies unable to withstand myeloablative conditioning We prospectively analyzed the outcomes of 123 patients median age 57 years range 23-70 years with hematologic malignancies treated with a uniform RIC regimen of cyclophosphamide fludarabine and total-body irradiation 200 cGy with or without antithymocyte globulin followed by related donor allogeneic HCT at the University of Minnesota between 2002 and 2008 The cohort included 45 patients with acute myelogenous AML or syndrome MDS 27 with aggressive NHL 8 with indolent NHL 10 with HL 10 with and 23 with acute lymphocytic chronic myelogenous other leukemias or disorders The probability of 4-year overall survival was 73 for patients with indolent NHL 58 for those with aggressive NHL 67 for those with HL 30 for those with AML/MDS and only 10 for those with Corresponding outcomes for relapse in these patients were 0 32 50 33 and 38 and those for progression-free survival were 73 45 27 27 and 10 The incidence of treatment-related mortality was 14 at day +100 and 22 at 1 year The incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease was 38 at day +100 and that of chronic graft-versus-host disease was 50 at 2 years Multivariate analysis revealed superior overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with both indolent and aggressive NHL compared with those with AML/MDS HL or Worse 1-year treatment-related mortality was observed in patients with a Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index score ≥ 3 and in cytomegalovirus-seropositive recipients These results suggest that 1 RIC conditioning was well tolerated by an older heavily pretreated population 2 patients with indolent and aggressive NHL respond well to RIC conditioning highlighting the importance of the graft-versus-lymphoma effect and 3 additional peri-transplantation manipulations are needed to improve outcomes for patients with AML/MDS or receiving RIC conditioning before HCT,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[405, 837, 1933, 3365, 8464, 3, 1075, 174, 1, 1063, 1007, 31, 497, 1085, 6, 7, 5, 813, 441, 4253, 6, 21330, 3246, 1933, 21, 1143, 311, 3, 123, 1, 2698, 7, 52, 89, 696, 60, 184, 382, 431, 60, 5, 813, 441, 73, 5, 8, 3490, 3365, 477, 1, 1112, 2027, 2, 181, 642, 1104, 1250, 3071, 5, 15, 187, 11016, 7819, 370, 20, 139, 1488, 1063, 1085, 28, 3, 1652, 1, 8297, 59, 1544, 2, 1375, 3, 180, 159, 512, 7, 5, 286, 2194, 329, 15, 681, 1223, 428, 5, 571, 1176, 66, 5, 2316, 1176, 79, 5, 1718, 79, 5, 2, 382, 5, 286, 1193, 442, 2194, 127, 2792, 15, 1997, 3, 1320, 1, 39, 111, 63, 25, 10, 803, 9, 7, 5, 2316, 1176, 717, 9, 135, 5, 571, 1176, 598, 9, 135, 5, 1718, 201, 9, 135, 5, 329, 1223, 2, 158, 79, 9, 135, 5, 1734, 123, 9, 429, 4, 46, 7, 11, 13, 531, 212, 466, 2, 519, 2, 135, 9, 91, 115, 25, 11, 803, 512, 428, 428, 2, 79, 3, 287, 1, 24, 139, 282, 10, 213, 28, 218, 394, 2, 350, 28, 14, 111, 3, 287, 1, 88, 215, 478, 286, 1599, 185, 1204, 34, 10, 519, 28, 218, 394, 2, 17, 1, 442, 1599, 185, 1204, 34, 10, 212, 28, 18, 60, 331, 65, 553, 1123, 63, 25, 2, 91, 115, 25, 4, 7, 5, 110, 2316, 2, 571, 1176, 72, 5, 135, 5, 329, 1223, 1718, 15, 639, 14, 111, 24, 139, 282, 10, 164, 4, 7, 5, 8, 1007, 31, 497, 1879, 558, 368, 749, 27, 2, 4, 7314, 9909, 2190, 46, 99, 309, 17, 14, 3365, 1933, 10, 149, 421, 20, 35, 434, 2447, 2193, 266, 18, 7, 5, 2316, 2, 571, 1176, 1892, 149, 6, 3365, 1933, 4051, 3, 1187, 1, 3, 1599, 185, 4763, 254, 2, 27, 402, 6164, 497, 13775, 32, 575, 6, 401, 123, 9, 7, 5, 329, 1223, 15, 357, 3365, 1933, 348, 1085]",2091.0,21047561,640

We evaluated the relationship of 25(OH)D serum levels with time-to-treatment (TTT) and overall survival (OS) in newly diagnosed CLL patients participating in a prospective cohort study (discovery cohort) and a separate cohort of previously untreated patients participating in an observational study (confirmation cohort). Of 390 CLL patients in the discovery cohort, 119 (30.5%) were 25(OH)D insufficient. After a median follow-up of 3 years, TTT (hazard ratio[HR] = 1.66; P = .005) and OS (HR = 2.39; P = .01) were shorter for 25(OH)D-insufficient patients. In the validation cohort, 61 of 153 patients (39.9%) were 25(OH)D insufficient. After a median follow-up of 9.9 years, TTT (HR = 1.59; P = .05) and OS (HR 1.63; P = .06) were again shorter for 25(OH)D-insufficient patients. On pooled multivariable analysis of patients in both cohorts adjusting for age, sex, Rai stage, CD38 status, ZAP-70 status, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) gene mutation status, CD49d status, and cytogenetic abnormalities assessed by interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization testing, 25(OH)D insufficiency remained an independent predictor of TTT (HR = 1.47; P = .008), although the association with OS was not significant (HR = 1.47; P = .07).

Flavopiridol pharmacogenetics: clinical and functional evidence for the role of SLCO1B1/OATP1B1 in flavopiridol disposition.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2010-11-01,"Flavopiridol is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor in phase II clinical development for treatment of various forms of cancer. When administered with a pharmacokinetically (PK)-directed dosing schedule, flavopiridol exhibited striking activity in patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This study aimed to evaluate pharmacogenetic factors associated with inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetics and outcomes associated with flavopiridol therapy. Thirty-five patients who received single-agent flavopiridol via the PK-directed schedule were genotyped for 189 polymorphisms in genes encoding 56 drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Genotypes were evaluated in univariate and multivariate analyses as covariates in a population PK model. Transport of flavopiridol and its glucuronide metabolite was evaluated in uptake assays in HEK-293 and MDCK-II cells transiently transfected with SLCO1B1. Polymorphisms in ABCC2, ABCG2, UGT1A1, UGT1A9, and SLCO1B1 were found to significantly correlate with flavopiridol PK in univariate analysis. Transport assay results indicated both flavopiridol and flavopiridol-glucuronide are substrates of the SLCO1B1/OATP1B1 transporter. Covariates incorporated into the final population PK model included bilirubin, SLCO1B1 rs11045819 and ABCC2 rs8187710. Associations were also observed between genotype and response. To validate these findings, a second set of data with 51 patients was evaluated, and overall trends for associations between PK and PGx were found to be consistent. Polymorphisms in transport genes were found to be associated with flavopiridol disposition and outcomes. Observed clinical associations with SLCO1B1 were functionally validated indicating for the first time its relevance as a transporter of flavopiridol and its glucuronide metabolite. A second 51-patient dataset indicated similar trends between genotype in the SLCO1B1 and other candidate genes, thus providing support for these findings. Further study in larger patient populations will be necessary to fully characterize and validate the clinical impact of polymorphisms in SLCO1B1 and other transporter and metabolizing enzyme genes on outcomes from flavopiridol therapy.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",3368.0,37.0,Flavopiridol is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor in phase II clinical development for treatment of various forms of cancer When administered with a pharmacokinetically PK -directed dosing schedule flavopiridol exhibited striking activity in patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic This study aimed to evaluate pharmacogenetic factors associated with inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetics and outcomes associated with flavopiridol therapy Thirty-five patients who received single-agent flavopiridol via the PK-directed schedule were genotyped for 189 polymorphisms in genes encoding 56 drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters Genotypes were evaluated in univariate and multivariate analyses as covariates in a population PK model Transport of flavopiridol and its glucuronide metabolite was evaluated in uptake assays in HEK-293 and MDCK-II cells transiently transfected with SLCO1B1 Polymorphisms in ABCC2 ABCG2 UGT1A1 UGT1A9 and SLCO1B1 were found to significantly correlate with flavopiridol PK in univariate analysis Transport assay results indicated both flavopiridol and flavopiridol-glucuronide are substrates of the SLCO1B1/OATP1B1 transporter Covariates incorporated into the final population PK model included bilirubin SLCO1B1 rs11045819 and ABCC2 rs8187710 Associations were also observed between genotype and response To validate these findings a second set of data with 51 patients was evaluated and overall trends for associations between PK and PGx were found to be consistent Polymorphisms in transport genes were found to be associated with flavopiridol disposition and outcomes Observed clinical associations with SLCO1B1 were functionally validated indicating for the first time its relevance as a transporter of flavopiridol and its glucuronide metabolite A second 51-patient dataset indicated similar trends between genotype in the SLCO1B1 and other candidate genes thus providing support for these findings Further study in larger patient populations will be necessary to fully characterize and validate the clinical impact of polymorphisms in SLCO1B1 and other transporter and metabolizing enzyme genes on outcomes from flavopiridol therapy,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[3030, 16, 8, 1226, 470, 216, 230, 4, 124, 215, 38, 193, 9, 24, 1, 747, 2377, 1, 12, 198, 468, 5, 8, 14920, 2395, 1166, 1280, 1055, 3030, 1416, 5133, 128, 4, 7, 5, 430, 442, 1193, 26, 45, 1295, 6, 376, 6578, 130, 41, 5, 3606, 797, 1982, 4, 1159, 2, 123, 41, 5, 3030, 36, 977, 365, 7, 54, 103, 226, 420, 3030, 847, 3, 2395, 1166, 1055, 11, 3053, 9, 5899, 1203, 4, 214, 2362, 664, 234, 9800, 3039, 2, 6733, 2071, 11, 194, 4, 880, 2, 331, 318, 22, 2489, 4, 8, 266, 2395, 202, 4294, 1, 3030, 2, 211, 11435, 3379, 10, 194, 4, 1135, 1013, 4, 22528, 7541, 2, 46319, 215, 37, 9235, 3245, 5, 13693, 1203, 4, 16426, 6447, 6192, 59525, 2, 13693, 11, 204, 6, 97, 1513, 5, 3030, 2395, 4, 880, 65, 4294, 719, 99, 1103, 110, 3030, 2, 3030, 11435, 32, 6063, 1, 3, 13693, 59526, 5246, 2489, 2449, 237, 3, 1457, 266, 2395, 202, 159, 5009, 13693, 59527, 2, 16426, 39471, 685, 11, 120, 164, 59, 1183, 2, 51, 6, 2183, 46, 272, 8, 419, 916, 1, 74, 5, 725, 7, 10, 194, 2, 63, 1963, 9, 685, 59, 2395, 2, 21639, 11, 204, 6, 40, 925, 1203, 4, 4294, 214, 11, 204, 6, 40, 41, 5, 3030, 5814, 2, 123, 164, 38, 685, 5, 13693, 11, 3772, 938, 1716, 9, 3, 157, 98, 211, 2088, 22, 8, 5246, 1, 3030, 2, 211, 11435, 3379, 8, 419, 725, 69, 3014, 1103, 288, 1963, 59, 1183, 4, 3, 13693, 2, 127, 1609, 214, 631, 1736, 538, 9, 46, 272, 195, 45, 4, 1077, 69, 1184, 303, 40, 1493, 6, 1910, 1507, 2, 2183, 3, 38, 345, 1, 1203, 4, 13693, 2, 127, 5246, 2, 9800, 1644, 214, 23, 123, 29, 3030, 36]",2185.0,21072184,64
Significant association between polymorphism of the erythropoietin gene promoter and myelodysplastic syndrome.,BMC medical genetics,BMC Med. Genet.,2010-11-16,"Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) may be induced by certain mutagenic environmental or chemotherapeutic toxins; however, the role of susceptibility genes remains unclear. The G/G genotype of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1617640 in the erythropoietin (EPO) promoter has been shown to be associated with decreased EPO expression. We examined the association of rs1617640 genotype with MDS. We genotyped the EPO rS1617640 SNP in 189 patients with MDS, 257 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 106 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 97 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 353 with chronic myeloid leukemia, and 95 healthy controls. The G/G genotype was significantly more common in MDS patients (47/187; 25.1%) than in controls (6/95; 6.3%) or in patients with other leukemias (101/813; 12.4%) (all P < 0.001). Individuals with the G/G genotype were more likely than those with other genotypes to have MDS (odd ratio = 4.98; 95% CI = 2.04-12.13). Clinical and follow up data were available for 112 MDS patients and 186 AML patients. There was no correlation between EPO promoter genotype and response to therapy or overall survival in MDS or AML. In the MDS group, the GG genotype was significantly associated with shorter complete remission duration, as compared with the TT genotype (P = 0.03). Time to neutrophils recovery after therapy was significantly longer in MDS patients with the G/G genotype (P = 0.02).

Silencing of the inhibitor of DNA binding protein 4 (ID4) contributes to the pathogenesis of mouse and human CLL.,Blood,Blood,2010-11-22,"Inhibitor of DNA binding protein 4 (ID4) is a member of the dominant-negative basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor family that lacks DNA binding activity and has tumor suppressor function. ID4 promoter methylation has been reported in acute myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), although the expression, function, and clinical relevance of this gene have not been characterized in either disease. We demonstrate that the promoter of ID4 is consistently methylated to various degrees in CLL cells, and increased promoter methylation in a univariable analysis correlates with shortened patient survival. However, ID4 mRNA and protein expression is uniformly silenced in CLL cells irrespective of the degree of promoter methylation.

CCL3 (MIP-1α) plasma levels and the risk for disease progression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2010-11-29,"B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling has been inferred as an important mechanism for disease progression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other B-cell malignancies. In response to BCR activation, CLL cells secrete the chemokine CCL3, which fosters interactions between CLL cells and the leukemia microenvironment. CCL3 secretion correlates with expression of the 70-kDa ζ-associated protein (ZAP-70) and responsiveness of the CLL clone to BCR stimulation. Here, we measured CCL3 plasma levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 351 CLL patients and examined CCL3 levels for associations with established prognostic markers and time from diagnosis to initial therapy. We found that CCL3 plasma concentrations were strongly associated with established prognostic markers. In a Cox proportional hazards regression model, CCL3 as well as established prognostic markers (immunoglobulin heavy chain variable-region mutation status, CD38 or ZAP-70 cytogenetics, clinical stage) were significantly associated with time to treatment. Multivariable analysis revealed that CCL3 (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.33, P < .0001), advanced clinical stage (HR = 2.75, P = .0025), poor risk cytogenetics (del 17p, HR = 2.38; del11q, HR = 2.36, P = .001), and CD38 expression (HR = 1.43, P = .023) were independent prognostic markers. Collectively, CCL3 is a novel, robust, and independent prognostic marker in CLL that can easily and reliably be measured by ELISA.

Genome-wide association study identifies a novel susceptibility locus at 6p21.3 among familial CLL.,Blood,Blood,2010-12-03,"Prior genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified 10 susceptibility loci for risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To identify additional loci, we performed a GWA study in 407 CLL cases (of which 102 had a family history of CLL) and 296 controls. Moreover, given the strong familial risk of CLL, we further subset our GWA analysis to the CLL cases with a family history of CLL to identify loci specific to these familial CLL cases. Our top hits from these analyses were evaluated in an additional sample of 252 familial CLL cases and 965 controls. Using all available data, we identified and confirmed an independent association of 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that met genome-wide statistical significance within the IRF8 (interferon regulatory factor 8) gene (combined P values ≤ 3.37 × 10(-8)), located in the previously identified 16q24.1 locus. Subsetting to familial CLL cases, we identified and confirmed a new locus on chromosome 6p21.3 (combined P value = 6.92 × 10(-9)). This novel region harbors the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DRB5 genes. Finally, we evaluated the 10 previously reported SNPs in the overall sample and replicated 8 of them.

The novel receptor tyrosine kinase Axl is constitutively active in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acts as a docking site of nonreceptor kinases: implications for therapy.,Blood,Blood,2010-12-06,"Recently, we detected that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B-cell-derived microvesicles in CLL plasma carry a constitutively phosphorylated novel receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), Axl, indicating that Axl was acquired from the leukemic B cells. To examine Axl status in CLL, we determined the expression of phosphorylated-Axl (P-Axl) in freshly isolated CLL B cells by Western blot analysis. We detected differential levels of P-Axl in CLL B cells, and further analysis showed that expression of P-Axl was correlated with the other constitutively phosphorylated kinases, including Lyn, phosphoinositide-3 kinase, SyK/ζ-associated protein of 70 kDa, phospholipase C γ2 in CLL B cells. We found that these intracellular signaling molecules were complexed with P-Axl in primary CLL B cells. When Axl and Src kinases were targeted by a Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, bosutinib (SKI-606), or a specific-inhibitor of Axl (R428), robust induction of CLL B-cell apoptosis was observed in both a dose- and time-dependent manner.

Cytogenet.,2010-12-01,"Five laboratories in the Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Research Consortium (CRC) investigated standardizing and pooling of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results as a collaborative research project. This investigation used fixed bone marrow and blood cells available from previous conventional cytogenetic or FISH studies in two pilot studies, a one-day workshop, and proficiency test. Multiple FISH probe strategies were used to detect 6q-, 11q-, +12, 13q-, 17p-, and IGH rearrangements. Ten specimens were studied by participants who used their own probes (pilot study 1). Of 312 FISH interpretations, 224 (72%) were true-negative, 74 (24%) true-positive, 6 (2%) false-negative, and 8 (3%) false-positive. In pilot study no. 2, each participant studied two specimens using identical FISH probe sets to control for variation due to probe sets and probe strategies. Of 80 FISH interpretations, no false interpretations were identified. At a subsequent workshop, discussions produced agreement on scoring criteria. The proficiency test that followed produced no false-negative results and 4% (3/68) false-positive interpretations. Interpretation disagreements among laboratories were primarily attributable to inadequate normal cutoffs, inconsistent scoring criteria, and the use of different FISH probe strategies. Collaborative organizations that use pooled FISH results may wish to impose more conservative empiric normal cutoff values or use an equivocal range between the normal cutoff and the abnormal reference range to eliminate false-positive interpretations. False-negative results will still occur, and would be expected in low-percentage positive cases; these would likely have less clinical significance than false positive results.

Progressive but previously untreated CLL patients with greater array CGH complexity exhibit a less durable response to chemoimmunotherapy.,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,Cancer Genet. Cytogenet.,2010-12-01,"To better understand the implications of genomic instability and outcome in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we sought to address genomic complexity as a predictor of chemosensitivity and ultimately clinical outcome in this disease. We used array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) with a one-million probe array and identified gains and losses of genetic material in 48 patients treated on a chemoimmunotherapy clinical trial. We identified chromosomal gain or loss in ≥6% of the patients on chromosomes 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 17. Higher genomic complexity, as a mechanism favoring clonal selection, was associated with shorter progression-free survival, and predicted a poor response to treatment. Of interest, CLL cases with loss of p53 surveillance showed more complex genomic features and were found both in patients with a 17p13.1 deletion and in the more favorable genetic subtype characterized by the presence of 13q14.1 deletion.

Use of matched unrelated donors compared with matched related donors is associated with lower relapse and superior progression-free survival after reduced-intensity conditioning hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2010-12-27,"As success of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) relies primarily on graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity, increased minor HLA disparity in unrelated compared to related donors could have a significant impact on transplant outcomes. To assess whether use of unrelated donors (URD) engenders more potent GVL in RIC HSCT compared to matched related donors (MRD), we retrospectively studied 433 consecutive T-replete 6/6 HLA matched URD (n = 246) and MRD (n = 187) RIC HSCT for hematologic malignancies at our institution. Diseases included: acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (127), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (71), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (68), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (64), Hodgkin disease (HD) (40), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (25), multiple myeloma (MM) (23), myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) (12), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (7), and other leukemia (1). All received uniform fludarabine and intravenous busulfan conditioning, and GVHD prophylaxis with tacrolimus/mini-methroxate (mini-MTX) or tacrolimus/sirolimus ± mini-MTX. Unrelated donors were younger compared to MRD (median donor age: 33 years versus 52 years, P < .0001), and provided larger CD34(+) products (median CD34(+) cells infused: 8.7 × 10(6)/kg versus 7.5 × 10(6)/kg, P = .002). Distribution of diseases, disease risk, prior transplant, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) status was similar in both cohorts. Cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD (at day +180), 2-year chronic GVHD, and 2-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were 20% versus 16%, 55% versus 50%, and 8% versus 6% in URD and MRD, respectively (P = NS). Cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years was lower in URD, 52% versus 65% (P = .005). With median follow-up of 26.5 and 35.8 months, 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly better in unrelated donor transplants, 39.5% for URD, and 29% for MRD (P = .01). Overall survival (OS) at 2 years were 56% for URD versus 50% for MRD (P = .53). In multivariable analysis, URD was associated with a lower risk of relapse (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, P = .002) and superior PFS (HR 0.69, P = .002). These results suggest that URD is associated with greater GVL activity than MRD, and could have practice changing impact on future donor selection in RIC HSCT.",Comparative Study,3312.0,45.0,As success of reduced-intensity conditioning RIC hematopoietic stem cell transplantation HSCT relies primarily on graft-versus-leukemia GVL activity increased minor HLA disparity in unrelated compared to related donors could have a significant impact on transplant outcomes To assess whether use of unrelated donors URD engenders more potent GVL in RIC HSCT compared to matched related donors MRD we retrospectively studied 433 consecutive T-replete 6/6 HLA matched URD n 246 and MRD n 187 RIC HSCT for hematologic malignancies at our institution Diseases included acute myelogenous AML 127 NHL 71 chronic lymphocytic CLL 68 syndrome MDS 64 disease HD 40 chronic myeloid CML 25 multiple MM 23 disorder MPD 12 acute lymphoblastic ALL 7 and other 1 All received uniform fludarabine and intravenous busulfan conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis with tacrolimus/mini-methroxate mini-MTX or tacrolimus/sirolimus ± mini-MTX Unrelated donors were younger compared to MRD median donor age 33 years versus 52 years P .0001 and provided larger CD34 products median CD34 cells infused 8.7 10 6 /kg versus 7.5 10 6 /kg P .002 Distribution of diseases disease risk prior transplant and cytomegalovirus CMV status was similar in both cohorts Cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD at day +180 2-year chronic GVHD and 2-year nonrelapse mortality NRM were 20 versus 16 55 versus 50 and 8 versus 6 in URD and MRD respectively P NS Cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years was lower in URD 52 versus 65 P .005 With median follow-up of 26.5 and 35.8 months 2-year progression-free survival PFS was significantly better in unrelated donor transplants 39.5 for URD and 29 for MRD P .01 Overall survival OS at 2 years were 56 for URD versus 50 for MRD P .53 In multivariable analysis URD was associated with a lower risk of relapse hazard ratio HR 0.67 P .002 and superior PFS HR 0.69 P .002 These results suggest that URD is associated with greater GVL activity than MRD and could have practice changing impact on future donor selection in RIC HSCT,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[22, 1825, 1, 405, 837, 1933, 3365, 1007, 452, 31, 497, 1703, 6495, 1561, 23, 1599, 185, 2647, 8149, 128, 101, 2278, 1160, 4326, 4, 2092, 72, 6, 139, 2344, 359, 47, 8, 93, 345, 23, 941, 123, 6, 423, 317, 119, 1, 2092, 2344, 5847, 39508, 80, 1157, 8149, 4, 3365, 1703, 72, 6, 655, 139, 2344, 2029, 21, 894, 656, 13224, 935, 102, 11151, 49, 49, 1160, 655, 5847, 78, 6907, 2, 2029, 78, 5568, 3365, 1703, 9, 813, 441, 28, 114, 731, 1342, 159, 286, 2194, 329, 4080, 1176, 792, 442, 1193, 552, 806, 681, 1223, 660, 34, 2701, 327, 442, 533, 903, 243, 232, 321, 382, 2645, 7712, 133, 286, 1275, 62, 67, 2, 127, 14, 62, 103, 3490, 2027, 2, 1262, 3906, 1933, 2, 1562, 2049, 5, 5643, 7313, 59688, 7313, 3453, 15, 5643, 4519, 810, 7313, 3453, 2092, 2344, 11, 773, 72, 6, 2029, 52, 1488, 89, 466, 60, 185, 653, 60, 19, 488, 2, 1052, 1077, 2215, 2766, 52, 2215, 37, 4524, 66, 67, 79, 49, 503, 185, 67, 33, 79, 49, 503, 19, 1111, 1395, 1, 1342, 34, 43, 324, 941, 2, 7314, 3879, 156, 10, 288, 4, 110, 736, 967, 287, 1, 88, 215, 478, 286, 1562, 28, 218, 3172, 18, 111, 442, 1562, 2, 18, 111, 4640, 282, 4296, 11, 179, 185, 245, 614, 185, 212, 2, 66, 185, 49, 4, 5847, 2, 2029, 106, 19, 4044, 967, 287, 1, 429, 28, 18, 60, 10, 280, 4, 5847, 653, 185, 556, 19, 1614, 5, 52, 166, 126, 1, 432, 33, 2, 465, 66, 53, 18, 111, 91, 115, 25, 300, 10, 97, 380, 4, 2092, 1488, 4016, 587, 33, 9, 5847, 2, 462, 9, 2029, 19, 355, 63, 25, 118, 28, 18, 60, 11, 664, 9, 5847, 185, 212, 9, 2029, 19, 699, 4, 658, 65, 5847, 10, 41, 5, 8, 280, 43, 1, 429, 360, 197, 168, 13, 598, 19, 1111, 2, 1123, 300, 168, 13, 790, 19, 1111, 46, 99, 309, 17, 5847, 16, 41, 5, 378, 8149, 128, 76, 2029, 2, 359, 47, 758, 3600, 345, 23, 508, 1488, 881, 4, 3365, 1703]",2034.0,21193054,718
Phase 1 and pharmacokinetic study of bolus-infusion flavopiridol followed by cytosine arabinoside and mitoxantrone for acute leukemias.,Blood,Blood,2011-01-14,"Flavopiridol is a protein bound, cytotoxic, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. Flavopiridol given by 1-hour bolus at 50 mg/m(2) daily 3 times followed by cytosine arabinoside and mitoxantrone (FLAM) is active in adults with poor-risk acute leukemias. A pharmacologically derived ""hybrid"" schedule (30-minute bolus followed by 4-hour infusion) of flavopiridol was more effective than bolus administration in refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Our phase 1 trial ""hybrid FLAM"" in 55 adults with relapsed/refractory acute leukemias began at a total flavopiridol dose of 50 mg/m(2) per day 3 times (20-mg/m(2) bolus, 30-mg/m(2) infusion). Dose-limiting toxicity occurred at level 6 (30-mg/m(2) bolus, 70-mg/m(2) infusion) with tumor lysis, hyperbilirubinemia, and mucositis. Death occurred in 5 patients (9%). Complete remission occurred in 22 (40%) across all doses. Overall and disease-free survivals for complete remission patients are more than 60% at more than 2 years. Pharmacokinetics demonstrated a dose-response for total and unbound plasma flavopiridol unrelated to total protein, albumin, peripheral blast count, or toxicity.

LDOC1 mRNA is differentially expressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and predicts overall survival in untreated patients.,Blood,Blood,2011-02-10,"We previously identified LDOC1 as one of the most significantly differentially expressed genes in untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with respect to the somatic mutation status of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region genes. However, little is known about the normal function of LDOC1, its contribution to the pathophysiology of CLL, or its prognostic significance. In this study, we have investigated LDOC1 mRNA expression in a large cohort of untreated CLL patients, as well as in normal peripheral blood B-cell (NBC) subsets and primary B-cell lymphoma samples. We have confirmed that LDOC1 is dramatically down-regulated in mutated CLL cases compared with unmutated cases, and have identified a new splice variant, LDOC1S. We show that LDOC1 is expressed in NBC subsets (naive > memory), suggesting that it may play a role in normal B-cell development. It is also expressed in primary B-cell lymphoma samples, in which its expression is associated with somatic mutation status. In CLL, we show that high levels of LDOC1 correlate with biomarkers of poor prognosis, including cytogenetic markers, unmutated somatic mutation status, and ZAP70 expression.

We report the long-term follow-up of the chemoimmunotherapy trial CALGB 9712 from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B, for which treatment regimen was previously reported, to examine end points of progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), impact of genomic features, and risk of therapy-related myeloid neoplasm (t-MN). A total of 104 patients were enrolled on this study and now have a median follow-up of 117 months (range, 66 to 131 months). The median OS was 85 months, and 71% of patients were alive at 5 years. The median PFS was 42 months, and 27% were progression free at 5 years. An estimated 13% remained free of progression at almost 10 years of follow-up. Multivariable models of PFS and OS showed that immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region mutational status was significant for both, whereas cytogenetic abnormalities were significant only for OS. No patient developed t-MN before relapse. Long-term follow-up of CALGB 9712 demonstrates extended OS and PFS with fludarabine plus rituximab.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: prognostic factors and impact on treatment.,Discovery medicine,Discov Med,2011-02-01,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a clonal malignancy of mature B cells that displays immense clinical heterogeneity as reflected by the observation that many patients have an indolent disease that will not require intervention for many years while others will present with an aggressive and symptomatic leukemia requiring immediate treatment.

There is no obvious survival advantage to early treatment versus observation but the timing as to when a patient will require treatment is highly unpredictable. Thus, there has been great interest in identifying prognostic markers that can be used to distinguish those patients who may have an aggressive form of CLL and might benefit from early intervention.

STAT-3 activates NF-kappaB in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.,Molecular cancer research : MCR,Mol. Cancer Res.,2011-03-01,"NF-κB plays a major role in the pathogenesis of B-cell neoplasms. A broad array of mostly extracellular stimuli has been reported to activate NF-κB, to various degrees, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. Because CLL cells harbor high levels of unphosphorylated STAT-3 (USTAT-3) and USTAT-3 was reported to activate NF-κB, we sought to determine whether USTAT-3 activates NF-κB in CLL. Using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we studied peripheral blood low-density cells from 15 patients with CLL and found that CLL cell nuclear extracts from all the samples bound to an NF-κB DNA probe, suggesting that NF-κB is constitutively activated in CLL. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that STAT-3 bound NF-κB p65, and confocal microscopy studies detected USTAT-3/NF-κB complexes in the nuclei of CLL cells, thereby confirming these findings. Furthermore, infection of CLL cells with retroviral STAT-3-short hairpin RNA attenuated the binding of NF-κB to DNA, as assessed by EMSA, and downregulated mRNA levels of NF-κB-regulated genes, as assessed by quantitative PCR. Taken together, our data suggest that USTAT-3 binds to the NF-κB p50/p65 dimers and that the USTAT-3/NF-κB complexes bind to DNA and activate NF-κB-regulated genes in CLL cells.",Journal Article,3248.0,46.0,NF-κB plays a major role in the pathogenesis of B-cell neoplasms A broad array of mostly extracellular stimuli has been reported to activate NF-κB to various degrees in chronic lymphocytic CLL cells Because CLL cells harbor high levels of unphosphorylated STAT-3 USTAT-3 and USTAT-3 was reported to activate NF-κB we sought to determine whether USTAT-3 activates NF-κB in CLL Using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay EMSA we studied peripheral blood low-density cells from 15 patients with CLL and found that CLL cell nuclear extracts from all the samples bound to an NF-κB DNA probe suggesting that NF-κB is constitutively activated in CLL Immunoprecipitation studies showed that STAT-3 bound NF-κB p65 and confocal microscopy studies detected USTAT-3/NF-κB complexes in the nuclei of CLL cells thereby confirming these findings Furthermore infection of CLL cells with retroviral STAT-3-short hairpin RNA attenuated the binding of NF-κB to DNA as assessed by EMSA and downregulated mRNA levels of NF-κB-regulated genes as assessed by quantitative PCR Taken together our data suggest that USTAT-3 binds to the NF-κB p50/p65 dimers and that the USTAT-3/NF-κB complexes bind to DNA and activate NF-κB-regulated genes in CLL cells,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[1365, 2448, 1698, 8, 458, 200, 4, 3, 1384, 1, 132, 31, 1179, 8, 2094, 1926, 1, 2754, 1976, 7478, 71, 85, 210, 6, 2977, 1365, 2448, 6, 747, 4133, 4, 442, 1193, 552, 37, 408, 552, 37, 2760, 64, 148, 1, 27040, 4168, 27, 29125, 27, 2, 29125, 27, 10, 210, 6, 2977, 1365, 2448, 21, 990, 6, 223, 317, 29125, 27, 3932, 1365, 2448, 4, 552, 75, 3, 10980, 5717, 3024, 719, 15941, 21, 656, 672, 315, 154, 1263, 37, 29, 167, 7, 5, 552, 2, 204, 17, 552, 31, 928, 8162, 29, 62, 3, 347, 2951, 6, 35, 1365, 2448, 261, 2888, 802, 17, 1365, 2448, 16, 2818, 735, 4, 552, 4857, 94, 224, 17, 4168, 27, 2951, 1365, 2448, 6781, 2, 6541, 3804, 94, 530, 29125, 27, 1365, 2448, 3817, 4, 3, 4725, 1, 552, 37, 2267, 5030, 46, 272, 798, 930, 1, 552, 37, 5, 8658, 4168, 27, 978, 5957, 893, 2656, 3, 791, 1, 1365, 2448, 6, 261, 22, 275, 20, 15941, 2, 3315, 956, 148, 1, 1365, 2448, 1065, 214, 22, 275, 20, 1156, 604, 1633, 1162, 114, 74, 309, 17, 29125, 27, 3333, 6, 3, 1365, 2448, 16197, 6781, 12608, 2, 17, 3, 29125, 27, 1365, 2448, 3817, 4060, 6, 261, 2, 2977, 1365, 2448, 1065, 214, 4, 552, 37]",1233.0,21364020,439
The role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-δ in the immunomodulatory effects of lenalidomide in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2011-03-04,"In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), lenalidomide can promote humoral immune responses but also induces a distinct disease-specific toxicity of tumor flare and cytokine release. These CLL-specific events result from increased expression of costimulatory molecules on B cells. Here we demonstrate that lenalidomide activation of CLL cells depends on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p110δ (PI3K-δ) pathway. Inhibition of PI3K-δ signaling by the PI3K-δ-inhibiting drug, CAL-101, or by siRNA knockdown of p110δ, abrogates CLL cell activation, costimulatory molecule expression, and vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor gene expression that is induced by lenalidomide.

Collectively, these data demonstrate the importance of PI3K-δ signaling for lenalidomide immune modulation.

However, recent data suggest that CLL cells may more closely resemble activated B cells. Using microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling of highly-enriched CLL cells from 38 patients and 9 untransformed B cells from normal donors before acute CpG activation and 5 matched B cells after acute CpG activation, we demonstrate an activated B cell status for CLL. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified statistically-significant similarities in miRNA expression between activated B cells and CLL cells including upregulation of miR-34a, miR-155, and miR-342-3p and downregulation of miR-103, miR-181a and miR-181b. Additionally, decreased levels of two CLL signature miRNAs miR-29c and miR-223 are associated with ZAP70(+) and IgV(H) unmutated status and with shorter time to first therapy.

Bruton tyrosine kinase represents a promising therapeutic target for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and is effectively targeted by PCI-32765.,Blood,Blood,2011-03-21,"B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is aberrantly activated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) is essential to BCR signaling and in knockout mouse models its mutation has a relatively B cell-specific phenotype. Herein, we demonstrate that BTK protein and mRNA are significantly over expressed in CLL compared with normal B cells. Although BTK is not always constitutively active in CLL cells, BCR or CD40 signaling is accompanied by effective activation of this pathway. Using the irreversible BTK inhibitor PCI-32765, we demonstrate modest apoptosis in CLL cells that is greater than that observed in normal B cells. No influence of PCI-32765 on T-cell survival is observed. Treatment of CD40 or BCR activated CLL cells with PCI-32765 results in inhibition of BTK tyrosine phosphorylation and also effectively abrogates downstream survival pathways activated by this kinase including ERK1/2, PI3K, and NF-κB. In addition, PCI-32765 inhibits activation-induced proliferation of CLL cells in vitro, and effectively blocks survival signals provided externally to CLL cells from the microenvironment including soluble factors (CD40L, BAFF, IL-6, IL-4, and TNF-α), fibronectin engagement, and stromal cell contact.

Ther.,2011-03-22,"Clinical trials using vaccine measles virus (MV) as anticancer therapy are already underway. We compared the oncolytic potential of MV in two B-cell malignancies; adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, an aggressive leukemia) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL, an indolent leukemia overexpressing Bcl-2) using patient-derived material. In vitro, distinct cytopathological effects were observed between MV-infected primary ALL and CLL cells, with large multinucleated syncytia forming in ALL cultures compared to minimal cell-to-cell fusion in infected CLL cells. Cell viability and immunoblotting studies confirmed rapid cell death in MV-infected ALL cultures and slower MV oncolysis of CLL cells. In cell lines, overexpression of Bcl-2 diminished MV-induced cell death providing a possible mechanism for the slower kinetic of MV oncolysis in CLL. In vivo, intratumoral MV treatment of established subcutaneous ALL xenografts had striking antitumor activity leading to complete resolution of all tumors. The antitumor activity of MV was also evident in disseminated ALL xenograft models. In summary, both ALL and CLL are targets for MV-mediated lysis albeit with different kinetics.

The authors report on long-term experience with NST in relapsed/refractory CLL and define prognostic factors associated with outcome. The authors reviewed the outcome of 86 patients with relapsed/relapsed CLL enrolled in sequential NST protocols. The median patient age was 58 years. Patients were heavily pretreated before transplantation, and 43 required immunomanipulation after NST for persistent or recurrent disease. Immunomanipulation included withdrawal of immunosuppression, rituximab, and step-wise donor lymphocyte infusions. Of 43 patients receiving immunomanipulation, 20 (47%) experienced a complete remission. Patients with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype A1(+) /A2(-) /B44(-) were more likely to experience a complete remission (P = .0009), with rates of 9%, 36%, 50%, and 91%, respectively, for 0, 1, 2, and 3 of these HLA factors. This resulted in significant improvement in progression-free-survival rates of 68.2% at 5 years for patients with all 3 HLA factors. Overall, the estimated 5-year survival rate was 51%. In a multivariate model, a CD4 count of <100/mm(3) and a below normal serum immunoglobulin G level at study entry were associated with a short survival duration (P < .0001).

Chemoimmunotherapy with O-FC in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2011-04-15,"We conducted an international phase 2 trial to evaluate 2 dose levels of ofatumumab, a human CD20 mAb, combined with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (O-FC) as frontline therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Patients with active CLL were randomized to ofatumumab 500 mg (n = 31) or 1000 mg (n = 30) day 1, with fludarabine 25 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m(2) days 2-4, course 1; days 1-3, courses 2-6; every 4 weeks for 6 courses. The first ofatumumab dose was 300 mg for both cohorts. The median age was 56 years; 13% of patients had a 17p deletion; 64% had β2-microglobulin > 3.5 mg/L. Based on the 1996 National Cancer Institute Working Group (NCI-WG) guidelines, the complete response (CR) rate as assessed by an independent review committee was 32% for the 500-mg and 50% for the 1000-mg cohort; the overall response (OR) rate was 77% and 73%, respectively. Based on univariable regression analyses, β2-microglobulin and the number of O-FC courses were significantly correlated (P < .05) with CR and OR rates and progression-free survival (PFS).

Tumor flare reaction associated with lenalidomide treatment in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia predicts clinical response.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-11-29,"In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), treatment with lenalidomide induces a unique, previously uncharacterized, immune response called tumor flare reaction (TFR). The clinical significance of this reaction remains unknown. Forty-five patients with CLL who were treated with lenalidomide in a phase 2 clinical trial were evaluated for the clinical features, intensity, and duration of TFR. Correlation was made with tumor response and the immune cellular microenvironment. Steroids for the prophylaxis of TFR was not given to patients in Group A (n = 29) whereas patients in Group B (n = 16) received low-dose prednisone as well as a slow dose escalation of lenalidomide for the prevention of TFR. Thirty (67%) patients experienced a TFR, with a grade 2 or 3 reaction (according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 3.0]) observed in 33% of patients (47% in Group A and 9% in Group B; P = .05). The median time to onset of the TFR was 6 days, and was longer in the patients receiving prophylaxis (4 days vs 9 days, respectively; P = .01). A complete response was observed in 7 of 30 (23%) patients with TFR and 1 of 15 (7%) patients without TFR. The median progression-free survival was 19.9 months and 19.4 months, respectively, for patients with versus those without TFR (P = .92).

Hairy cell leukemia: a successful model for experimental therapeutics--pentostatin and new ideas.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2011-06-01,"Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) was once considered an untreatable form of chronic lymphoid malignancy. Based upon the recognition of the importance of adenosine deaminase to the normal B cell survival and proliferation, a hypothesis was developed that temporary inhibition of this enzyme might be therapeutically successful in treating chronic B cell leukemias. Pentostatin was initially explored in patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Both pentostatin and cladribine, purine nucleoside analogs, have been utilized to successfully treat HCL. The high degree of complete and durable remission observed with either agent resulted in many believing that the treatment of this rare disease had been fully optimized. However, a considerable number of patients will relapse. While tremendous progress has been made in initial management, the issues related to optimal therapy, timing of initiation of treatment, and discovery of novel agents that may be effective in those who have relapsed are important. Investigational agents currently being explored in chronic lymphocytic leukemia may also have benefit for those patients who have relapsed or are resistant to therapy of hairy cell leukemia. Many important questions remain (e.g. importance of minimal residual disease) and will require international collaboration to fully address these unanswered questions.

For the intention-to-treat analysis, the overall response rate was 65%, including 29% complete response. The estimated progression-free survival was 10.6 months and median overall survival was 16.7 months. Although we noted higher complete response in high-risk patients after CFAR compared with a similar population who had received fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab as salvage therapy, there was no significant improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival appeared worse.

Lenalidomide as initial therapy of elderly patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2011-07-01,"The best initial therapy for elderly patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has not yet been defined. We investigated the activity of lenalidomide as initial therapy for elderly patients with CLL. Sixty patients with CLL 65 years of age and older received treatment with lenalidomide orally 5 mg daily for 56 days, then titrated up to 25 mg/d as tolerated. Treatment was continued until disease progression. At a median follow-up of 29 months, 53 patients (88%) are alive and 32 patients (53%) remain on therapy. Estimated 2-year progression-free survival is 60%. The overall response rate to lenalidomide therapy is 65%, including 10% complete response, 5% complete response with residual cytopenia, 7% nodular partial response, and 43% partial response. Neutropenia is the most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related toxicity observed in 34% of treatment cycles. Major infections or neutropenic fever occurred in 13% of patients.

Cross-talk between chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and bone marrow endothelial cells: role of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2011-07-05,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia bone marrow is characterized by increased angiogenesis. However, the molecular mediators of neovascularization and the biologic significance of increased endothelial cell proliferation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia require further investigation. Because signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 is constitutively activated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, we studied the role of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in modulating vascular endothelial growth factor expression and the effect of vascular endothelial cells on chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we found that anti-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 antibodies immunoprecipitated DNA of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, vascular endothelial growth factor, and other signal transducer and activator of transcription 3-regulated genes. In addition, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3-short interfering RNA significantly reduced messenger RNA levels of vascular endothelial growth factor in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, suggesting that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 induces vascular endothelial growth factor expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Remarkably, bone marrow chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells expressed high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, and high vascular endothelial growth factor levels were detected in the plasma of patients with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia and correlated with white blood cell count. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia bone marrow biopsies revealed increased microvascular density and attachment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells to endothelial cells. Coculture of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells showed a similar attachment. Furthermore, coculture studies with human umbilical vein endothelial cells showed that human umbilical vein endothelial cells protected chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells from spontaneous apoptosis by direct cell-to-cell contact as assessed by flow cytometry using annexin V.

"Frontline chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, alemtuzumab, and rituximab for high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",Blood,Blood,2011-07-12,"Frontline chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) is associated with superior overall survival (OS) for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Alemtuzumab (A) was added to FCR (CFAR) in a phase 2 trial for high-risk untreated patients < 70 years with serum β-2 microglobulin (β2M) ≥ 4 mg/L. Sixty patients were enrolled; median age was 59 years (range, 42-69); 75% were male; median β2M was 5.1 mg/L (range, 4-11.6); and 51% were Rai III-IV. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 70%, partial remission (PR) in 18%, nodular PR in 3%, for an overall response of 92%. Of 14 patients with 17p deletion, CR was achieved by 8 (57%). Of 57 BM samples evaluated by 3-color flow cytometry at the end of treatment, 41 (72%) were negative for residual disease. Grade 3-4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred with 33% and 13% courses, respectively. The median progression-free survival was 38 months and median OS was not reached. In conclusion, CFAR is an active frontline regimen for high-risk CLL. Response rates and survival are comparable with historic high-risk FCR-treated patients.

Decreased sensitivity of 17p-deleted chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells to a small molecule BCL-2 antagonist ABT-737.,Cancer,Cancer,2011-07-14,"Despite the high complete response rates achieved with fludarabine-based regimens, relapse is inevitable in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Relapsed patients often acquire deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del[17p]), which are closely associated with tumor protein 53 (TP53) mutations. Wild-type p53 up-regulates and activates B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2)-associated X protein (BAX), and it down-regulates and inactivates BCL-2. The small-molecule BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-737 induces apoptosis in a BAX-dependent and BCL-2 homologous antagonist-killer (BAK)-dependent manner. The role of p53 in sensitivity of CLL cells to BCL-2 inhibition has not been extensively investigated. The authors investigated the association of del(17p) with ABT-737 sensitivity in CLL cells from 50 patients. Stable p53 and BAX knockdown cells were used for mechanistic studies. CLL cells with del(17p) were less sensitive to ABT-737-induced BAX activation and apoptosis than CLL cells without del(17p) (39% ± 7.3% vs 63.7% ± 2.9% [specific annexin V induction]; P < .01). A positive correlation between the degrees of apoptosis induced by ABT-737 and by the p53-activating binding protein homolog murine double minute (MDM2) antagonist nutlin-3a (correlation coefficient [r] = 0.75; P < .0001) was observed.

We examined the types of FLC abnormalities and prognostic utility of the FLC assay compared with standard prognostic biomarkers in a prospective cohort of 339 patients with newly diagnosed CLL. Three types of FLC abnormalities were identified: monoclonal elevated FLC (elevated κ and/or λ with abnormal FLC ratio), polyclonal elevated FLC (elevated κ and/or λ with normal FLC ratio), and ratio-only FLC abnormality (normal range κ and λ with abnormal FLC ratio). One hundred sixty-five patients (49%) had a FLC abnormality with approximately equal distribution among monoclonal elevation, polyclonal elevation, and ratio-only abnormality. All FLC abnormalities were associated with poor time to first treatment: monoclonal FLC (hazard ratio [HR], 4.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.94-8.48), polyclonal FLC (HR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.24-4.64), ratio-only FLC (HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.40-4.69).

Malignancies occurring during therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and other hematologic malignancies.,Blood,Blood,2011-08-16,"Success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has given patients hope for a long disease-free-survival. A longer survival raises the question of late effects, including development of another malignancy. Records of 1445 patients with CML/myeloproliferative neoplasm or other hematologic malignancies treated with TKIs were reviewed to investigate frequency and characteristics of second malignancies (other than acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome). The number of second cancers was compared with the number expected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. After a median follow-up of 107 months (range, 13-362 months) after CML/myeloproliferative neoplasm diagnosis, 66 patients (4.6%) developed 80 second cancers, including skin (31%), prostate (15%), melanoma (13%), digestive system (10%), kidney (4%), thyroid (4%), breast (3%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (3%), hepatobiliary (3%), and other cancers (14%). Excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers, 55 second cancers were seen in 51 (3.5%) of all patients treated.

Safety and persistence of adoptively transferred autologous CD19-targeted T cells in patients with relapsed or chemotherapy refractory B-cell leukemias.,Blood,Blood,2011-08-17,"We report the findings from the first 10 patients with chemotherapy-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) we have enrolled for treatment with autologous T cells modified to express 19-28z, a second-generation chimeric antigen (Ag) receptor specific to the B-cell lineage Ag CD19. Eight of the 9 treated patients tolerated 19-28z(+) T-cell infusions well. Three of 4 evaluable patients with bulky CLL who received prior conditioning with cyclophosphamide exhibited either a significant reduction or a mixed response in lymphadenopathy without concomitant development of B-cell aplasia. In contrast, one patient with relapsed ALL who was treated in remission with a similar T-cell dose developed a predicted B-cell aplasia. The short-term persistence of infused T cells was enhanced by prior cyclophosphamide administration and inversely proportional to the peripheral blood tumor burden. Further analyses showed rapid trafficking of modified T cells to tumor and retained ex vivo cytotoxic potential of CD19-targeted T cells retrieved 8 days after infusion. We conclude that this adoptive T-cell approach is promising and more likely to show clinical benefit in the setting of prior conditioning chemotherapy and low tumor burden or minimal residual disease.

To potentially gain insight into outcomes in patients previously treated with or refractory to rituximab, we performed an ad hoc retrospective analysis in the final 96 FA-ref and 111 BF-ref patients. There were 117 patients previously treated with rituximab (98 rituximab-refractory); 89 patients were rituximab-naive. For rituximab-treated, rituximab-refractory, and rituximab-naive patients, overall response rate was 43%, 44%, and 53%; median progression-free survival was 5.3, 5.5, and 5.6 months; and median overall survival was 15.5, 15.5, and 20.2 months. There were no significant differences in ofatumumab-related infusion reactions, or hematologic or infectious adverse events between subgroups.

After 3 cycles of therapy, patients had a significant reduction in percentage (%) and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and an increase in percentage of T cells, percentage of activated CD8(+) T cells producing IFN-γ, and percentage of regulatory T (T(R) ) cells when compared with their respective levels before treatment. After 15 cycles of treatment, responder patients had significant reduction in percentage of lymphocytes and ALC, percentage of activated CD4(+) T cells producing IL-2, IFN-γ, or TNF-α, and percentage of T(R) cells when compared with their perspective levels after 3 cycles of treatment.

Adverse prognostic features in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)","Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",2011-07-01,"Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) can have variable courses, from indolent disease to rapid progression with limited response to treatment. The Rai and Binet staging systems were the first to classify patients into prognostic categories. Newer prognostic markers that correlate with shorter time to progression and time to treatment include elevated serum beta2M, TK, ZAP-70, and CD38, as well as unmutated IgV(H). Abnormal cytogenetics are found in the majority of patients with CLL. Del(17p), as well as mutations of TP53, is associated with an aggressive clinical course and short overall survival. Nearly one-fifth of patients have del(11q) and have a significantly shorter median progression-free survival; mutations in the ATM gene, located on 11q, may also have adverse prognostic implications.

Following tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) complications, the protocol was amended to a phase 1 study to identify the maximum tolerated dose-escalation level (MTDEL). Fifty-two heavily pretreated patients, 69% with bulky disease and 48% with high-risk genomic abnormalities, initiated lenalidomide at 2.5 mg/day, with dose escalation until the MTDEL or the maximum assigned dose was attained. Lenalidomide was safely titrated to 20 mg/day; the MTDEL was not reached. Most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia; TLS was mild and rare.

Signal transduction inhibitors in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Current opinion in oncology,Curr Opin Oncol,2011-11-01,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) therapy has evolved over the past few decades as modern chemo-immunotherapy significantly improved the response and survival of CLL patients. However, treatment toxicity of the intensive chemo-immunotherapy often limits its use in the mostly elderly population of patients. Further, the disease eventually relapses and additional therapy options are required. Of particular interest are molecular targeted therapies that interfere with critical signal transduction pathways controlling cell growth and survival. This review will provide an update on the most recent preclinical and clinical development of signal transduction targeted therapy in CLL. Small molecular kinase inhibitors have been developed to target the proximal B-cell receptor signaling pathway (e.g. spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitors and Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors) or the downstream phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. These agents showed unique in-vitro activities by inducing apoptosis and blocking interaction of CLL cells and the protective microenvironment. They have also shown promising clinical activity in early-phase clinical studies and appear to alter lymphocyte trafficking. Inhibitors of the B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family of antiapoptotic proteins and Cdk inhibitors are in active clinical development. Strategies modulating the CLL interaction with the microenvironment niche are emerging. Further understanding of novel signaling pathways helps to identify additional potential therapeutic targets.

AP-1 elements and TCL1 protein regulate expression of the gene encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPROt in leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2011-10-14,"We previously demonstrated that the gene encoding PTPROt, the truncated form of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O expressed predominantly in hematopoietic cells, is a candidate tumor suppressor and is down-regulated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Here, we show that PTPROt expression is significantly reduced in CD19(+) spleen B cells from Eμ-T cell leukemia 1 (TCL1) transgenic mice relative to the wild-type mice. Strikingly, as much as a 60% decrease in PTPROt expression occurs at 7 weeks independently of promoter methylation. To elucidate the potential mechanism for this early suppression of PTPROt in these mice, we explored the role of activating protein-1 (AP-1) in its expression. We first demonstrate that AP-1 activation by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate induces PTPROt expression with concurrent recruitment of c-fos and c-jun to its promoter. The PTPROt promoter is also responsive to over- and underexpression of AP-1, confirming the role of AP-1 in PTPROt expression.

Hematologist/oncologist disease-specific expertise and survival: lessons from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).,Cancer,Cancer,2011-08-26,"The impact of physicians' disease-specific expertise on patient outcome is unknown. Although previous studies suggest a survival advantage for cancer patients cared for at high-volume centers, these observations may simply reflect referral bias or better access to advanced technologies, clinical trials, and multidisciplinary support at large centers. We evaluated time to first treatment (TTFT) and overall survival (OS) of patients with newly diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) at a single academic center based on whether they were cared for by a hematologist/oncologist who subspecializes in CLL (CLL hematologist) or a hematologist/oncologist with expertise in other areas (non-CLL hematologist). Among 1309 newly diagnosed patients with CLL cared for between 1999 and 2009, 773(59%) were cared for by CLL hematologists and 536 were cared for by non-CLL hematologists. Among early-stage patients (Rai 0-I), median TTFT (9.2 vs 6.1 years; P < .001) and OS (10.5 years vs 8.8 years; P < .001) were longer for patients cared for by CLL hematologists. For all patients, OS was superior for patients cared for by CLL hematologists (10.5 years vs 8.4 years; P = .001). Physician's disease-specific expertise remained an independent predictor of OS after adjusting for age, sex, stage, and lymphocyte count at diagnosis. Patients seen by a CLL hematologist were also more likely to participate in clinical trials (48% vs 16%; P < .001).

Pathol.,2011-11-11,"This study is focused on therapy-related myeloid neoplasms after the most promising frontline FCR (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab) therapy in previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. A total of 28 therapy-related myeloid neoplasm patients were identified, including 19 patients from 3 well-controlled FCR frontline trials (n=426 patients), giving an estimated frequency of 4.5% (1.9-8.3%) in a follow-up period of 44 months (range 5-122 months). Clinically, therapy-related myeloid neoplasms could emerge directly from 'prolonged myelosuppression' after FCR (10 patients), or after achieving complete hematological recovery (n=18). The overall latency was 35 months (range 3-118 months), with the former group of 23 months and the latter 42 months (P<0.001). In all, 10 cases presented as therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and 18 as therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes. Abnormal cytogenetics was present in 26 of 27 (96%) patients, with frequent chromosomes 5 and 7 abnormalities. The median survival was 7 months after therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. Our results indicate that the risk of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms secondary to frontline FCR therapy may not be as high as previously reported after removing the confounding factor of previous cytotoxic exposure, but this risk increased with older age and likely growth factor co-administration. Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms after FCR therapy shares clinicopathological features with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms secondary to other alkylating agents, but has a shorter latency interval indicating possible synergetic effects of the nucleotide analog fludarabine.

"Histone deacetylases mediate the silencing of miR-15a, miR-16, and miR-29b in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",Blood,Blood,2011-11-16,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) demonstrates a global down-regulation of miR-15a and miR-16 and a selective silencing of the related miR-29b in aggressive disease. Deletions in chromosome 13 [del(13q14)] partially account for the loss of expression of miR-15a and miR-16, but the mechanisms by which miR-29b becomes silenced is unknown. In the present study, we show that the histone deacetylases (HDACs) are overexpressed in CLL and mediate the epigenetic silencing of miR-15a, miR-16, and miR-29b. HDAC inhibition triggered the accumulation of the transcriptionally activating chromatin modification H3K4me2 and restored the expression of miR-15a, miR-16, and miR-29b in approximately 35% of samples. Ectopic expression of miR-15a and miR-16 and HDAC inhibition-induced expression of miR-15a, miR-16, or miR-29b in primary CLL cells was associated with declines in the levels of Mcl-1, but not Bcl-2, mitochondrial dysfunction, and induction of cell death. Therefore, our results show that HDACs aberrantly silence the expression of the critical tumor suppressors miR-15a, miR-16, and miR-29b in CLL. Deacetylase inhibition may be a therapeutic strategy that restores the expression of these miRs to antagonize Mcl-1, an important survival protein in these cells.

CAL-101: a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase p110-delta inhibitor for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies.,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,2011-11-24,"The management of lymphoid malignancies has greatly evolved in the last decade with the advent of targeted therapies, which have improved response and survival in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and plasma cell myeloma (PCM). The PI3K pathway seems to play a seminal role in the development of lymphoid malignancies. CAL-101 is a highly selective PI3K p110δ inhibitor currently undergoing clinical development. The aims of this review are to summarize our understanding of the PI3K pathway, its role in lymphoid malignancies, the preclinical and clinical experience accumulated with CAL-101, a PI3Kδ inhibitor, and potential areas of future development.

The prognostic difference of monoallelic versus biallelic deletion of 13q in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2011-12-02,"Fluorescence in situ hybridization can detect genomic abnormalities in up to 80% of cases and provides prognostic information on patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Although 13q deletion as the sole abnormality has been found to confer a favorable prognosis, there are little data as to whether there is a difference in prognostic value between monoallelic versus biallelic deletion of 13q. The authors reviewed the electronic database for patients with CLL who carried the 13q deletion as the sole abnormality and presented to The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). Untreated patients were separated into 2 groups: those having monoallelic versus those with biallelic deletion of 13q. Using Mann-Whitney, chi-square, and Kaplan-Meier analysis, the baseline quantitative and qualitative variables for each group, along with the time from presentation to MDACC to treatment, were compared. A total of 176 patients were identified; 143 patients had a monoallelic deletion of 13q, whereas 33 patients had a biallelic deletion. The only significantly different values between the groups were albumin (4.5 g/dL vs 4.4 g/dL; P = .01) and zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70) expression (1.7% vs 4.8%; P = .010). The median time from fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis to treatment in both the monoallelic and biallelic groups had not been reached (P = not significant).

SF3B1 and other novel cancer genes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2011-12-12,"The somatic genetic basis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a common and clinically heterogeneous leukemia occurring in adults, remains poorly understood. We obtained DNA samples from leukemia cells in 91 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and performed massively parallel sequencing of 88 whole exomes and whole genomes, together with sequencing of matched germline DNA, to characterize the spectrum of somatic mutations in this disease. Nine genes that are mutated at significant frequencies were identified, including four with established roles in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (TP53 in 15% of patients, ATM in 9%, MYD88 in 10%, and NOTCH1 in 4%) and five with unestablished roles (SF3B1, ZMYM3, MAPK1, FBXW7, and DDX3X). SF3B1, which functions at the catalytic core of the spliceosome, was the second most frequently mutated gene (with mutations occurring in 15% of patients). SF3B1 mutations occurred primarily in tumors with deletions in chromosome 11q, which are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We further discovered that tumor samples with mutations in SF3B1 had alterations in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing.

The Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor PCI-32765 thwarts chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell survival and tissue homing in vitro and in vivo.,Blood,Blood,2011-12-16,"B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is a critical pathway in the pathogenesis of several B-cell malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and can be targeted by inhibitors of BCR-associated kinases, such as Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk). PCI-32765, a selective, irreversible Btk inhibitor, is a novel, molecularly targeted agent for patients with B-cell malignancies, and is particularly active in patients with CLL. In this study, we analyzed the mechanism of action of PCI-32765 in CLL, using in vitro and in vivo models, and performed correlative studies on specimens from patients receiving therapy with PCI-32765. PCI-32765 significantly inhibited CLL cell survival, DNA synthesis, and migration in response to tissue homing chemokines (CXCL12, CXCL13). PCI-32765 also down-regulated secretion of BCR-dependent chemokines (CCL3, CCL4) by the CLL cells, both in vitro and in vivo. In an adoptive transfer TCL1 mouse model of CLL, PCI-32765 affected disease progression. In this model, PCI-32765 caused a transient early lymphocytosis, and profoundly inhibited CLL progression, as assessed by weight, development, and extent of hepatospenomegaly, and survival.

Substantial susceptibility of chronic lymphocytic leukemia to BCL2 inhibition: results of a phase I study of navitoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory disease.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2011-12-19,"BCL2 overexpression is a hallmark of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The novel BH3 mimetic navitoclax (ABT-263) specifically inhibits BCL2 and related proteins BCL-x(l) and BCL-w, potently inducing apoptosis of CLL cells in vitro. A phase I trial in patients with CLL was conducted to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and biologic activity of oral navitoclax. Twenty-nine patients with relapsed or refractory CLL received daily navitoclax for 14 days (10, 110, 200, or 250 mg/d; n = 15) or 21 days (125, 200, 250, or 300 mg/d; n = 14) of each 21-day cycle. Dose escalation decisions were informed by continual reassessment methodology. Lymphocytosis was reduced by more than 50% in 19 of 21 patients with baseline lymphocytosis. Among 26 patients treated with navitoclax ≥ 110 mg/d, nine (35%) achieved a partial response and seven maintained stable disease for more than 6 months. Median treatment duration was 7 months (range, 1 to ≥ 29 months). Median progression-free survival was 25 months. Activity was observed in patients with fludarabine-refractory disease, bulky adenopathy, and del(17p) CLL. Thrombocytopenia due to BCL-x(l) inhibition was the major dose-limiting toxicity and was dose-related.

"A two-gene signature, SKI and SLAMF1, predicts time-to-treatment in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",PloS one,PLoS ONE,2011-12-14,"We developed and validated a two-gene signature that predicts prognosis in previously-untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. Using a 65 sample training set, from a cohort of 131 patients, we identified the best clinical models to predict time-to-treatment (TTT) and overall survival (OS). To identify individual genes or combinations in the training set with expression related to prognosis, we cross-validated univariate and multivariate models to predict TTT. We identified four gene sets (5, 6, 12, or 13 genes) to construct multivariate prognostic models. By optimizing each gene set on the training set, we constructed 11 models to predict the time from diagnosis to treatment. Each model also predicted OS and added value to the best clinical models. To determine which contributed the most value when added to clinical variables, we applied the Akaike Information Criterion. Two genes were consistently retained in the models with clinical variables: SKI (v-SKI avian sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) and SLAMF1 (signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 1; CD150). We optimized a two-gene model and validated it on an independent test set of 66 samples.

To investigate the potential role of PI3Kδ in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), we screened 5 HL cell lines and primary samples from patients with HL for PI3Kδ isoform expression and constitutive PI3K pathway activation. Inhibition of PI3Kδ by GS-1101 resulted in the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. Cocultures with stroma cells induced Akt activation in HL cells, and this effect was blocked by GS-1101. Conversely, production of the stroma-stimulating chemokine, CCL5, by HL cells was reduced by GS-1101. GS-1101 also induced dose-dependent apoptosis of HL cells at 48 hours. Reductions in cell viability and apoptosis were enhanced when combining GS-1101 with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus.

Allogeneic transplantation represents the only potentially curative option for CLL, but fully ablative regimens applied in the past have been associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Reduced-intensity preparative regimens has made application of allogeneic transplant to CLL patients much more feasible and increased the number of patients proceeding to this modality.

"A randomized, controlled trial of Panax quinquefolius extract (CVT-E002) to reduce respiratory infection in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",The journal of supportive oncology,J Support Oncol,2012-01-23,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients are at high risk for acute respiratory illness (ARI). We evaluated the safety and efficacy of a proprietary extract of Panax quinquefolius, CVT-E002, in reducing ARI. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 293 subjects with early-stage, untreated CLL conducted January-March 2009. ARI was common, occurring on about 10% of days during the study period. There were no significant differences of the 2 a priori primary end points: ARI days (8.5 ± 17.2 for CVT-E002 vs 6.8 ± 13.3 for placebo) and severe ARI days (2.9 ± 9.5 for CVT-E002 vs 2.6 ± 9.8 for placebo). However, 51% of CVT-E002 vs 56% of placebo recipients experienced at least 1 ARI (difference, -5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -16% to 7%); more intense ARI occurred in 32% of CVT-E002 vs 39% of placebo recipients (difference, -7%; 95% CI, -18% to 4%), and symptom-specific evaluation showed reduced moderate to severe sore throat (P = .004) and a lower rate of grade ≥3 toxicities (P = .02) in CVT-E002 recipients.

PCI-32765: a novel Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies.,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,2012-02-03,"There has been a significant paradigm shift in the manner in which lymphoid malignancies are treated and managed. Treatment has been moving away from conventional chemotherapy and towards targeted therapy. The success of new classes of agents such as monoclonal antibodies, proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory derivatives has sparked further searches for novel pathways to inhibit. The Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) pathway is a downstream mediator of the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway, which is crucial in B-cell production and maintenance, and a potential therapeutic target. This review will summarize the current knowledge of the Btk pathway and its role in lymphoid malignancies. It will also discuss the present data about PCI-32765 in both the preclinical and clinical setting. PCI-32765 is an oral irreversible Btk inhibitor with high potency and both preclinical and clinical activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Phase I studies have demonstrated that it is well tolerated and has an excellent safety profile.

Variations of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia lack substantial impact on progression-free survival and overall survival: a Cancer and Leukemia Group B study.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2012-06-02,"The impact of mutation of the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) gene in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treatment outcome has not been examined. We studied ATM mutations in 73 patients treated with fludarabine and rituximab. ATM gene mutation analysis was performed using temperature gradient capillary electrophoresis. The impact of detected variants on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was tested with proportional hazards models. None of the 73 patients demonstrated truncating ATM mutations; 17 (23%, 95% confidence interval 14-35%) had non-silent variants (ATM-NSVs), including 13 known ATM polymorphisms and four missense variants. ATM-NSVs were not significantly associated with any baseline characteristics including immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene (IGVH) status.

Four patients at doses of 4.5 mg/kg and 6.0 mg/kg experienced grade 3 or 4 asymptomatic elevated amylase and lipase levels. Of the 26 patients enrolled, 17 patients had stable disease (mean duration of 76 days, range 29-504 days) and one patient had a nodular partial response for 230 days.

Quantitative DNA methylation analysis identifies a single CpG dinucleotide important for ZAP-70 expression and predictive of prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2012-05-07,"Increased ZAP-70 expression predicts poor prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Current methods for accurately measuring ZAP-70 expression are problematic, preventing widespread application of these tests in clinical decision making. We therefore used comprehensive DNA methylation profiling of the ZAP-70 regulatory region to identify sites important for transcriptional control. High-resolution quantitative DNA methylation analysis of the entire ZAP-70 gene regulatory regions was conducted on 247 samples from patients with CLL from four independent clinical studies. Through this comprehensive analysis, we identified a small area in the 5' regulatory region of ZAP-70 that showed large variability in methylation in CLL samples but was universally methylated in normal B cells. High correlation with mRNA and protein expression, as well as activity in promoter reporter assays, revealed that within this differentially methylated region, a single CpG dinucleotide and neighboring nucleotides are particularly important in ZAP-70 transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, by using clustering approaches, we identified a prognostic role for this site in four independent data sets of patients with CLL using time to treatment, progression-free survival, and overall survival as clinical end points. Comprehensive quantitative DNA methylation analysis of the ZAP-70 gene in CLL identified important regions responsible for transcriptional regulation. In addition, loss of methylation at a specific single CpG dinucleotide in the ZAP-70 5' regulatory sequence is a highly predictive and reproducible biomarker of poor prognosis in this disease.

Alkylating agents have shown activity in leukemia. Bendamustine, an active alkylating agent in lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, was given in a fractionated twice daily schedule for 4 days to patients with acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to define the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Adults with refractory acute leukemia or high-risk MDS were treated with bendamustine at a starting dose of 50 mg/m(2) IV over 1-2 hours twice daily for 4 days. Dose escalations were by 25 mg/m(2) in the 1st 3 levels. The study used the 3 + 3 design. A total of 25 patients were treated. Their median age was 57 years; the median salvage number was 3. Grade 2 creatinine elevations were observed in 1 of 6 patients at the 50 mg/m(2) dose, in 2 of 13 patients at the 75 mg/m(2) dose, and in 3 of 6 patients at the 100 mg/m(2) dose. This was considered significant, even though DLT was not reached. One patient achieved marrow complete remission. Significant reductions of marrow blasts (50% or more) were observed in 6 of 25 patients (24%). Bendamustine fractionated dose level of 100 mg/m(2) IV twice daily for 4 days (800 mg/m(2) per course) was associated with Grade 2 renal toxicity.

TCL1: a shared tumor-associated antigen for immunotherapy against B-cell lymphomas.,Blood,Blood,2012-05-29,"Immunotherapy with therapeutic idiotype vaccines offers promise for treatment of B-cell malignancies. However, identification of novel immunogenic lymphoma-associated antigens that are universally expressed is necessary to overcome the barriers of patient-specific idiotype vaccines. Here, we determined whether T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1 (TCL1) oncoprotein encoded by the TCL1 gene could be a target for immunotherapy of B-cell malignancies. We show that TCL1 mRNA and protein are selectively expressed in normal B cells but markedly hyperexpressed in multiple human B-cell lymphomas, including follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma.

BCL2 suppresses PARP1 function and nonapoptotic cell death.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2012-06-11,"BCL2 suppresses apoptosis by binding the BH3 domain of proapoptotic factors and thereby regulating outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Many tumor types, including B-cell lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, are dependent on BCL2 for survival but become resistant to apoptosis after treatment. Here, we identified a direct interaction between the antiapoptotic protein BCL2 and the enzyme PARP1, which suppresses PARP1 enzymatic activity and inhibits PARP1-dependent DNA repair in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells. The BH3 mimetic ABT-737 displaced PARP1 from BCL2 in a dose-dependent manner, reestablishing PARP1 activity and DNA repair and promoting nonapoptotic cell death. This form of cell death was unaffected by resistance to single-agent ABT-737 that results from upregulation of antiapoptotic BCL2 family members. On the basis of the ability of BCL2 to suppress PARP1 function, we hypothesized that ectopic BCL2 expression would kill PARP inhibitor-sensitive cells. Strikingly, BCL2 expression reduced the survival of PARP inhibitor-sensitive breast cancer and lung cancer cells by 90% to 100%, and these effects were reversed by ABT-737. Taken together, our findings show that a novel interaction between BCL2 and PARP1 blocks PARP1 enzymatic activity and suppresses PARP1-dependent repair.

The B-cell receptor signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in CLL.,Blood,Blood,2012-06-19,"Targeted therapy with imatinib and other selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors has transformed the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Unlike chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) lacks a common genetic aberration amenable to therapeutic targeting. However, our understanding of normal B-cell versus CLL biology points to differences in properties of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling that may be amenable to selective therapeutic targeting. The application of mouse models has further expanded this understanding and provides information about targets in the BCR signaling pathway that may have other important functions in cell development or long-term health. In addition, overexpression or knockout of selected targets offers the potential to validate targets genetically using new mouse models of CLL. The initial success of BCR-targeted therapies has promoted much excitement in the field of CLL. At the present time, GS-1101, which reversibly inhibits PI3Kδ, and ibrutinib (PCI-32765), an irreversible inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase, have generated the most promising early results in clinical trials including predominately refractory CLL where durable disease control has been observed.

ER stress and autophagy: new discoveries in the mechanism of action and drug resistance of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol.,Blood,Blood,2012-06-27,"Cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, such as flavopiridol, demonstrate significant single-agent activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but the mechanism of action in these nonproliferating cells is unclear. Here we demonstrate that CLL cells undergo autophagy after treatment with therapeutic agents, including fludarabine, CAL-101, and flavopiridol as well as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-inducing agent thapsigargin. The addition of chloroquine or siRNA against autophagy components enhanced the cytotoxic effects of flavopiridol and thapsigargin, but not the other agents. Similar to thapsigargin, flavopiridol robustly induces a distinct pattern of ER stress in CLL cells that contributes to cell death through IRE1-mediated activation of ASK1 and possibly downstream caspases. Both autophagy and ER stress were documented in tumor cells from CLL patients receiving flavopiridol. Thus, CLL cells undergo autophagy after multiple stimuli, including therapeutic agents, but only with ER stress mediators and CDK inhibitors is autophagy a mechanism of resistance to cell death. These findings collectively demonstrate, for the first time, a novel mechanism of action (ER stress) and drug resistance (autophagy) for CDK inhibitors, such as flavopiridol in CLL, and provide avenues for new therapeutic combination approaches in this disease.",Evaluation Study,2764.0,67.0,Cyclin dependent kinase CDK inhibitors such as flavopiridol demonstrate significant single-agent activity in chronic lymphocytic CLL but the mechanism of action in these nonproliferating cells is unclear Here we demonstrate that CLL cells undergo autophagy after treatment with therapeutic agents including fludarabine CAL-101 and flavopiridol as well as the endoplasmic reticulum ER stress-inducing agent thapsigargin The addition of chloroquine or siRNA against autophagy components enhanced the cytotoxic effects of flavopiridol and thapsigargin but not the other agents Similar to thapsigargin flavopiridol robustly induces a distinct pattern of ER stress in CLL cells that contributes to cell death through IRE1-mediated activation of ASK1 and possibly downstream caspases Both autophagy and ER stress were documented in tumor cells from CLL patients receiving flavopiridol Thus CLL cells undergo autophagy after multiple stimuli including therapeutic agents but only with ER stress mediators and CDK inhibitors is autophagy a mechanism of resistance to cell death These findings collectively demonstrate for the first time a novel mechanism of action ER stress and drug resistance autophagy for CDK inhibitors such as flavopiridol in CLL and provide avenues for new therapeutic combination approaches in this disease,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[1226, 470, 216, 3954, 222, 225, 22, 3030, 608, 93, 226, 420, 128, 4, 442, 1193, 552, 84, 3, 670, 1, 1578, 4, 46, 30207, 37, 16, 1200, 467, 21, 608, 17, 552, 37, 1251, 2240, 50, 24, 5, 189, 183, 141, 2027, 10368, 2338, 2, 3030, 22, 149, 22, 3, 6057, 6078, 516, 1531, 1958, 420, 10414, 3, 352, 1, 14325, 15, 1919, 480, 2240, 1628, 651, 3, 759, 176, 1, 3030, 2, 10414, 84, 44, 3, 127, 183, 288, 6, 10414, 3030, 8547, 1516, 8, 834, 1177, 1, 516, 1531, 4, 552, 37, 17, 2444, 6, 31, 273, 298, 17744, 517, 363, 1, 31994, 2, 2150, 1489, 7629, 110, 2240, 2, 516, 1531, 11, 1405, 4, 30, 37, 29, 552, 7, 357, 3030, 631, 552, 37, 1251, 2240, 50, 232, 7478, 141, 189, 183, 84, 158, 5, 516, 1531, 4425, 2, 3954, 222, 16, 2240, 8, 670, 1, 251, 6, 31, 273, 46, 272, 2535, 608, 9, 3, 157, 98, 8, 229, 670, 1, 1578, 516, 1531, 2, 234, 251, 2240, 9, 3954, 222, 225, 22, 3030, 4, 552, 2, 377, 6612, 9, 217, 189, 150, 611, 4, 26, 34]",1322.0,22740450,370
Single nucleotide polymorphisms and inherited risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia among African Americans.,Blood,Blood,2012-06-28,"The incidence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is significantly lower in African Americans than whites, but overall survival is inferior.

Integrative gene expression profiling reveals G6PD-mediated resistance to RNA-directed nucleoside analogues in B-cell neoplasms.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2012-07-27,"The nucleoside analogues 8-amino-adenosine and 8-chloro-adenosine have been investigated in the context of B-lineage lymphoid malignancies by our laboratories due to the selective cytotoxicity they exhibit toward multiple myeloma (MM), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell lines and primary cells. Encouraging pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of 8-chloro-adenosine being documented in an ongoing Phase I trial in CLL provide additional impetus for the study of these promising drugs. In order to foster a deeper understanding of the commonalities between their mechanisms of action and gain insight into specific patient cohorts positioned to achieve maximal benefit from treatment, we devised a novel two-tiered chemoinformatic screen to identify molecular determinants of responsiveness to these compounds. This screen entailed: 1) the elucidation of gene expression patterns highly associated with the anti-tumor activity of 8-chloro-adenosine in the NCI-60 cell line panel, 2) characterization of altered transcript abundances between paired MM and MCL cell lines exhibiting differential susceptibility to 8-amino-adenosine, and 3) integration of the resulting datasets. This approach generated a signature of seven unique genes including G6PD which encodes the rate-determining enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Bioinformatic analysis of primary cell gene expression data demonstrated that G6PD is frequently overexpressed in MM and CLL, highlighting the potential clinical implications of this finding. Utilizing the paired sensitive and resistant MM and MCL cell lines as a model system, we go on to demonstrate through loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies that elevated G6PD expression is necessary to maintain resistance to 8-amino- and 8-chloro-adenosine but insufficient to induce de novo resistance in sensitive cells. Taken together, these results indicate that G6PD activity antagonizes the cytotoxicity of 8-substituted adenosine analogues and suggests that administration of these agents to patients with B-cell malignancies exhibiting normal levels of G6PD expression may be particularly efficacious.",Journal Article,2734.0,5.0,The nucleoside analogues 8-amino-adenosine and 8-chloro-adenosine have been investigated in the context of B-lineage lymphoid malignancies by our laboratories due to the selective cytotoxicity they exhibit toward multiple MM chronic lymphocytic CLL and mantle cell MCL cell lines and primary cells Encouraging pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of 8-chloro-adenosine being documented in an ongoing Phase I trial in CLL provide additional impetus for the study of these promising drugs In order to foster a deeper understanding of the commonalities between their mechanisms of action and gain insight into specific patient cohorts positioned to achieve maximal benefit from treatment we devised a novel two-tiered chemoinformatic screen to identify molecular determinants of responsiveness to these compounds This screen entailed 1 the elucidation of gene expression patterns highly associated with the anti-tumor activity of 8-chloro-adenosine in the NCI-60 cell line panel 2 characterization of altered transcript abundances between paired MM and MCL cell lines exhibiting differential susceptibility to 8-amino-adenosine and 3 integration of the resulting datasets This approach generated a signature of seven unique genes including G6PD which encodes the rate-determining enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway PPP glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase Bioinformatic analysis of primary cell gene expression data demonstrated that G6PD is frequently overexpressed in MM and CLL highlighting the potential clinical implications of this finding Utilizing the paired sensitive and resistant MM and MCL cell lines as a model system we go on to demonstrate through loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies that elevated G6PD expression is necessary to maintain resistance to 8-amino- and 8-chloro-adenosine but insufficient to induce de novo resistance in sensitive cells Taken together these results indicate that G6PD activity antagonizes the cytotoxicity of 8-substituted adenosine analogues and suggests that administration of these agents to patients with B-cell malignancies exhibiting normal levels of G6PD expression may be particularly efficacious,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 4032, 4768, 66, 3078, 4938, 2, 66, 14778, 4938, 47, 85, 565, 4, 3, 1533, 1, 132, 2542, 2303, 441, 20, 114, 4884, 520, 6, 3, 1094, 1408, 491, 2239, 1317, 232, 321, 442, 1193, 552, 2, 2757, 31, 1308, 31, 285, 2, 86, 37, 2269, 1456, 2, 2424, 1571, 1, 66, 14778, 4938, 486, 1405, 4, 35, 942, 124, 70, 160, 4, 552, 377, 402, 11582, 9, 3, 45, 1, 46, 721, 600, 4, 1732, 6, 9899, 8, 6029, 612, 1, 3, 20534, 59, 136, 483, 1, 1578, 2, 1803, 2670, 237, 112, 69, 736, 14240, 6, 1359, 2725, 247, 29, 24, 21, 10085, 8, 229, 100, 14526, 61718, 2413, 6, 255, 219, 3403, 1, 3642, 6, 46, 2411, 26, 2413, 22116, 14, 3, 7481, 1, 145, 55, 764, 561, 41, 5, 3, 312, 30, 128, 1, 66, 14778, 4938, 4, 3, 2580, 335, 31, 328, 993, 18, 2136, 1, 1495, 3268, 19988, 59, 2355, 321, 2, 1308, 31, 285, 4801, 1777, 1432, 6, 66, 3078, 4938, 2, 27, 2676, 1, 3, 1113, 3455, 26, 353, 1419, 8, 1651, 1, 648, 991, 214, 141, 16146, 92, 4322, 3, 116, 2196, 1644, 1, 3, 19943, 4849, 308, 16951, 2522, 49, 4849, 2374, 10121, 65, 1, 86, 31, 145, 55, 74, 264, 17, 16146, 16, 746, 1711, 4, 321, 2, 552, 4051, 3, 174, 38, 1268, 1, 26, 1567, 2600, 3, 2355, 745, 2, 436, 321, 2, 1308, 31, 285, 22, 8, 202, 398, 21, 3537, 23, 6, 608, 298, 407, 1, 343, 2, 1803, 1, 343, 94, 17, 804, 16146, 55, 16, 1493, 6, 3040, 251, 6, 66, 3078, 2, 66, 14778, 4938, 84, 3027, 6, 1290, 1566, 2018, 251, 4, 745, 37, 1633, 1162, 46, 99, 1008, 17, 16146, 128, 11574, 3, 1408, 1, 66, 10536, 4938, 4768, 2, 844, 17, 634, 1, 46, 183, 6, 7, 5, 132, 31, 441, 4801, 295, 148, 1, 16146, 55, 68, 40, 823, 3289]",2168.0,22848499,634
Addition of granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor does not improve response to early treatment of high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia with alemtuzumab and rituximab.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk.

STAT3 mutations unify the pathogenesis of chronic lymphoproliferative disorders of NK cells and T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2012-08-02,"Chronic lymphoproliferative disorders of natural killer cells (CLPD-NKs) and T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemias (T-LGLs) are clonal lymphoproliferations arising from either natural killer cells or cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). We have investigated for distribution and functional significance of mutations in 50 CLPD-NKs and 120 T-LGL patients by direct sequencing, allele-specific PCR, and microarray analysis. STAT3 gene mutations are present in both T and NK diseases: approximately one-third of patients with each type of disorder convey these mutations. Mutations were found in exons 21 and 20, encoding the Src homology 2 domain. Patients with mutations are characterized by symptomatic disease (75%), history of multiple treatments, and a specific pattern of STAT3 activation and gene deregulation, including increased expression of genes activated by STAT3. Many of these features are also found in patients with wild-type STAT3, indicating that other mechanisms of STAT3 activation can be operative in these chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. Treatment with STAT3 inhibitors, both in wild-type and mutant cases, resulted in accelerated apoptosis.

A two-stage evaluation of genetic variation in immune and inflammation genes with risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma identifies new susceptibility locus in 6p21.3 region.,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev.,2012-08-21,"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a malignancy of lymphocytes, and there is growing evidence for a role of germline genetic variation in immune genes in NHL etiology. To identify susceptibility immune genes, we conducted a 2-stage analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from 1,253 genes using the Immune and Inflammation Panel. In Stage 1, we genotyped 7,670 SNPs in 425 NHL cases and 465 controls, and in Stage 2 we genotyped the top 768 SNPs on an additional 584 cases and 768 controls. The association of individual SNPs with NHL risk from a log-additive model was assessed using the OR and 95% confidence intervals (CI). In the pooled analysis, only the TAP2 coding SNP rs241447 (minor allele frequency = 0.26; Thr655Ala) at 6p21.3 (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.17-1.53) achieved statistical significance after accounting for multiple testing (P = 3.1 × 10(-5)). The TAP2 SNP was strongly associated with follicular lymphoma (FL, OR = 1.82, 95%CI 1.46-2.26; p = 6.9 × 10(-8)), and was independent of other known loci (rs10484561 and rs2647012) from this region. The TAP2 SNP was also associated with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.08-1.77; P = 0.011), but not chronic lymphocytic leukemia (OR = 1.08; 95% CI 0.88-1.32). Higher TAP2 expression was associated with the risk allele in both FL and DLBCL tumors. Genetic variation in TAP2 was associated with NHL risk overall, and FL risk in particular, and this was independent of other established loci from 6p21.3.

Composite mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma: a clinicopathologic and molecular study.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2012-08-31,"Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) share many features and both arise from CD5+ B-cells; their distinction is critical as MCL is a more aggressive neoplasm. Rarely, cases of composite MCL and CLL/SLL have been reported. Little is known about the nature of these cases and, in particular, the clonal relationship of the 2 lymphomas. Eleven composite MCL and CLL/SLL cases were identified. The clinical, morphologic and immunophenotypic features of the MCL and CLL/SLL were characterized. IGH (immunoglobulin heavy chain) gene analysis was performed on microdissected MCL and CLL/SLL components to assess their clonal relationship. Ten patients had lymphadenopathy, and 7 patients had bone marrow involvement. The MCL component had the following growth patterns: in situ (n = 1), mantle zone (n = 3), nodular and diffuse (n = 3), diffuse (n = 3), and interstitial in the bone marrow (the only patient without lymphadenopathy) (n = 1); 6 MCLs had blastoid or pleomorphic and 5 small lymphocytic features. The CLL/SLL component was nodular (n = 9) or diffuse (n = 2). All MCL were CD5(+) and cyclin D1(+) with t(11;14) translocation. All CLL/SLL were CD5(+), CD23(+) and negative for cyclin D1 or t(11;14). IGH gene analysis showed that the MCL and CLL/SLL components displayed different sized fragments, indicating that the MCL and CLL/SLL are likely derived from different neoplastic B-cell clones. The lack of a clonal relationship between the MCL and CLL/SLL components suggests that MCL and CLL/SLL components represent distinct disease processes and do not share a common progenitor B-cell.",Case Reports,2699.0,20.0,Mantle cell MCL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic CLL/SLL share many features and both arise from CD5+ B-cells their distinction is critical as MCL is a more aggressive neoplasm Rarely cases of composite MCL and CLL/SLL have been reported Little is known about the nature of these cases and in particular the clonal relationship of the 2 lymphomas Eleven composite MCL and CLL/SLL cases were identified The clinical morphologic and immunophenotypic features of the MCL and CLL/SLL were characterized IGH immunoglobulin heavy chain gene analysis was performed on microdissected MCL and CLL/SLL components to assess their clonal relationship Ten patients had lymphadenopathy and 7 patients had marrow involvement The MCL component had the following growth patterns in situ n 1 mantle zone n 3 nodular and diffuse n 3 diffuse n 3 and interstitial in the marrow the only patient without lymphadenopathy n 1 6 MCLs had blastoid or pleomorphic and 5 small lymphocytic features The CLL/SLL component was nodular n 9 or diffuse n 2 All MCL were CD5 and cyclin D1 with t 11 14 translocation All CLL/SLL were CD5 CD23 and negative for cyclin D1 or t 11 14 IGH gene analysis showed that the MCL and CLL/SLL components displayed different sized fragments indicating that the MCL and CLL/SLL are likely derived from different neoplastic B-cell clones The lack of a clonal relationship between the MCL and CLL/SLL components suggests that MCL and CLL/SLL components represent distinct disease processes and do not share a common progenitor B-cell,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[2757, 31, 1308, 2, 442, 1193, 2647, 302, 1193, 552, 5302, 4349, 445, 404, 2, 110, 3043, 29, 6349, 132, 37, 136, 6628, 16, 740, 22, 1308, 16, 8, 80, 571, 2131, 2416, 140, 1, 3308, 1308, 2, 552, 5302, 47, 85, 210, 1215, 16, 440, 545, 3, 2202, 1, 46, 140, 2, 4, 1454, 3, 1946, 858, 1, 3, 18, 1557, 2627, 3308, 1308, 2, 552, 5302, 140, 11, 108, 3, 38, 2815, 2, 6599, 404, 1, 3, 1308, 2, 552, 5302, 11, 765, 5221, 2593, 4013, 1260, 145, 65, 10, 173, 23, 9418, 1308, 2, 552, 5302, 1628, 6, 423, 136, 1946, 858, 1618, 7, 42, 4962, 2, 67, 7, 42, 581, 799, 3, 1308, 1249, 42, 3, 366, 129, 764, 4, 957, 78, 14, 2757, 3614, 78, 27, 4481, 2, 1388, 78, 27, 1388, 78, 27, 2, 4543, 4, 3, 581, 3, 158, 69, 187, 4962, 78, 14, 49, 20994, 42, 16186, 15, 4581, 2, 33, 302, 1193, 404, 3, 552, 5302, 1249, 10, 4481, 78, 83, 15, 1388, 78, 18, 62, 1308, 11, 6349, 2, 1226, 2146, 5, 102, 175, 213, 2006, 62, 552, 5302, 11, 6349, 9937, 2, 199, 9, 1226, 2146, 15, 102, 175, 213, 5221, 145, 65, 224, 17, 3, 1308, 2, 552, 5302, 1628, 2507, 338, 8568, 5843, 1716, 17, 3, 1308, 2, 552, 5302, 32, 322, 526, 29, 338, 2000, 132, 31, 2749, 3, 926, 1, 8, 1946, 858, 59, 3, 1308, 2, 552, 5302, 1628, 844, 17, 1308, 2, 552, 5302, 1628, 1231, 834, 34, 1849, 2, 1022, 44, 4349, 8, 186, 2520, 132, 31]",1549.0,22944294,20
IL-21 in the bone marrow microenvironment contributes to IgM secretion and proliferation of malignant cells in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.,Blood,Blood,2012-09-13,"Cytokines within the tumor microenvironment play an important role in supporting the growth and survival of B-cell malignancies. One such cytokine, IL-21, promotes the growth of myeloma and Hodgkin lymphoma cells while inducing apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, the biologic significance of IL-21 has not been examined in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM), a B-cell lymphoma characterized by elevated serum IgM and a lymphoplasmacytic bone marrow infiltrate. We report here on the presence of IL-21 in the bone marrow of patients with WM and have identified activated T cells as the source of this cytokine. We readily detected the IL-21 receptor on malignant WM B cells and show that IL-21 significantly increases both IgM secretion and cellular proliferation of these cells with no effect on viability. IL-21 rapidly induces phosphorylation of STAT3 in WM cells, and treatment of the WM cell line MWCL-1 with a STAT3 inhibitor abolished the IL-21-mediated increases in cellular proliferation and IgM secretion. IL-21 also increased the expression of known STAT3 targets involved in B-cell differentiation, including BLIMP-1, XBP-1, IL-6, and IL-10.

Selective inhibitors of nuclear export show that CRM1/XPO1 is a target in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2012-10-03,"The nuclear export protein XPO1 is overexpressed in cancer, leading to the cytoplasmic mislocalization of multiple tumor suppressor proteins. Existing XPO1-targeting agents lack selectivity and have been associated with significant toxicity. Small molecule selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINEs) were designed that specifically inhibit XPO1. Genetic experiments and X-ray structures demonstrate that SINE covalently bind to a cysteine residue in the cargo-binding groove of XPO1, thereby inhibiting nuclear export of cargo proteins. The clinical relevance of SINEs was explored in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a disease associated with recurrent XPO1 mutations. Evidence is presented that SINEs can restore normal regulation to the majority of the dysregulated pathways in CLL both in vitro and in vivo and induce apoptosis of CLL cells with a favorable therapeutic index, with enhanced killing of genomically high-risk CLL cells that are typically unresponsive to traditional therapies. More importantly, SINE slows disease progression, and improves overall survival in the Eμ-TCL1-SCID mouse model of CLL with minimal weight loss or other toxicities.

Phytanic acid and the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,2012-10-05,"Greater consumption of red meat, processed meat and dairy products has been associated with an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in several previous reports. Phytanic acid, a saturated fatty acid obtained primarily through the consumption of ruminant meat and dairy products, may offer a potential underlying mechanism for these associations. In a population-based case-control study of 336 cases and 460 controls conducted in Nebraska during 1999-2002, we examined whether phytanic acid-containing foods or total phytanic acid intake, estimated from a food frequency questionnaire and the published phytanic acid values of 151 food items, were associated with increased NHL risk. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for overall NHL and the common NHL histologic subtypes. In multivariable models, higher intakes of density-adjusted beef [OR(T3 vs. T1) = 1.5 (1.1-2.2); P(trend) = 0.02], total dairy products [OR = 1.5 (1.1-2.2); P(trend) = 0.02) and milk [OR = 1.6 (1.1-2.3); P(trend) = 0.01] were associated with an increased risk of NHL. Intake of total phytanic acid was positively associated with NHL risk [OR = 1.5 (1.0-2.1); P(trend) = 0.04]. In analyses stratified by NHL subtype, greater consumption of beef was associated with an increased risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and greater consumption of milk was associated with an increased risk of follicular lymphoma (FL). Total phytanic acid intake was associated with an increased risk of FL and small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib (PCI-32765) has significant activity in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2012-10-08,"Survival and progression of mature B-cell malignancies depend on signals from the B-cell antigen receptor, and Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a critical signaling kinase in this pathway. We evaluated ibrutinib (PCI-32765), a small-molecule irreversible inhibitor of BTK, in patients with B-cell malignancies. Patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia received escalating oral doses of ibrutinib. Two schedules were evaluated: one, 28 days on, 7 days off; and two, once-daily continuous dosing. Occupancy of BTK by ibrutinib in peripheral blood was monitored using a fluorescent affinity probe. Dose escalation proceeded until either the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was achieved or, in the absence of MTD, until three dose levels above full BTK occupancy by ibrutinib. Response was evaluated every two cycles. Fifty-six patients with a variety of B-cell malignancies were treated over seven cohorts. Most adverse events were grade 1 and 2 in severity and self-limited. Dose-limiting events were not observed, even with prolonged dosing. Full occupancy of the BTK active site occurred at 2.5 mg/kg per day, and dose escalation continued to 12.5 mg/kg per day without reaching MTD. Pharmacokinetic data indicated rapid absorption and elimination, yet BTK occupancy was maintained for at least 24 hours, consistent with the irreversible mechanism. Objective response rate in 50 evaluable patients was 60%, including complete response of 16%. Median progression-free survival in all patients was 13.6 months. Ibrutinib, a novel BTK-targeting inhibitor, is well tolerated, with substantial activity across B-cell histologies.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",2661.0,696.0,Survival and progression of mature B-cell malignancies depend on signals from the B-cell antigen receptor and Bruton tyrosine kinase BTK is a critical signaling kinase in this pathway We evaluated ibrutinib PCI-32765 a small-molecule irreversible inhibitor of BTK in patients with B-cell malignancies Patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell and chronic lymphocytic received escalating oral doses of ibrutinib Two schedules were evaluated one 28 days on 7 days off and two once-daily continuous dosing Occupancy of BTK by ibrutinib in peripheral blood was monitored using a fluorescent affinity probe Dose escalation proceeded until either the maximum-tolerated dose MTD was achieved or in the absence of MTD until three dose levels above full BTK occupancy by ibrutinib Response was evaluated every two cycles Fifty-six patients with a variety of B-cell malignancies were treated over seven cohorts Most adverse events were grade 1 and 2 in severity and self-limited Dose-limiting events were not observed even with prolonged dosing Full occupancy of the BTK active site occurred at 2.5 mg/kg per day and dose escalation continued to 12.5 mg/kg per day without reaching MTD Pharmacokinetic data indicated rapid absorption and elimination yet BTK occupancy was maintained for at least 24 hours consistent with the irreversible mechanism Objective response rate in 50 evaluable patients was 60 including complete response of 16 Median progression-free survival in all patients was 13.6 months Ibrutinib a novel BTK-targeting inhibitor is well tolerated with substantial activity across B-cell histologies,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[25, 2, 91, 1, 2908, 132, 31, 441, 4533, 23, 2312, 29, 3, 132, 31, 448, 153, 2, 5796, 564, 216, 3611, 16, 8, 740, 314, 216, 4, 26, 308, 21, 194, 1795, 3943, 12229, 8, 302, 1354, 4422, 230, 1, 3611, 4, 7, 5, 132, 31, 441, 7, 5, 591, 15, 430, 132, 31, 2, 442, 1193, 103, 2922, 518, 415, 1, 1795, 100, 2314, 11, 194, 104, 339, 162, 23, 67, 162, 1889, 2, 100, 1059, 391, 1314, 1280, 8509, 1, 3611, 20, 1795, 4, 672, 315, 10, 2909, 75, 8, 2910, 3601, 2888, 61, 1125, 6406, 1100, 361, 3, 689, 421, 61, 961, 10, 513, 15, 4, 3, 1127, 1, 961, 1100, 169, 61, 148, 2090, 1647, 3611, 8509, 20, 1795, 51, 10, 194, 454, 100, 410, 1461, 437, 7, 5, 8, 1362, 1, 132, 31, 441, 11, 73, 252, 648, 736, 96, 290, 281, 11, 88, 14, 2, 18, 4, 1702, 2, 1074, 383, 61, 817, 281, 11, 44, 164, 871, 5, 1069, 1280, 1647, 8509, 1, 3, 3611, 544, 606, 489, 28, 18, 33, 81, 503, 379, 218, 2, 61, 1125, 1351, 6, 133, 33, 81, 503, 379, 218, 187, 6168, 961, 1456, 74, 1103, 1321, 6125, 2, 3730, 1145, 3611, 8509, 10, 1955, 9, 28, 506, 259, 1459, 925, 5, 3, 4422, 670, 461, 51, 116, 4, 212, 859, 7, 10, 335, 141, 236, 51, 1, 245, 52, 91, 115, 25, 4, 62, 7, 10, 233, 49, 53, 1795, 8, 229, 3611, 529, 230, 16, 149, 421, 5, 1281, 128, 716, 132, 31, 3489]",1606.0,23045577,697

Pinpointing large numbers of rearrangement breakpoints to base-pair resolution allows analysis of rearrangement microhomology and genomic location for every sample. Here we analyze 95 tumor genome sequences from breast, head and neck, colorectal, and prostate carcinomas, and from melanoma, multiple myeloma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We discover three genomic factors that are significantly correlated with the distribution of rearrangements: replication time, transcription rate, and GC content. The correlation is complex, and different patterns are observed between tumor types, within tumor types, and even between different types of rearrangements. Mutations in the APC gene correlate with and, hence, potentially contribute to DNA breakage in late-replicating, low %GC, untranscribed regions of the genome.

An institutional review board-approved review was performed on patients with CLL and melanoma treated from 1995 to 2009 at Moffitt Cancer Center and compared with the incidence of melanoma and CLL in our tumor registry patients with breast, prostate, lung, and colon cancer. Fifty-two patients (44 males; median age, 71 years [range, 46-88]) were identified with concurrent diagnoses of melanoma and CLL. Twenty-two patients (42 %) had CLL on SLNB for their melanoma. Thirty-two patients (62 %) were diagnosed with melanoma before CLL. Concomitant or prior cancer diagnoses included nonmelanoma skin cancers (N = 29), prostate (N = 6), colorectal (N = 2), and Merkel cell carcinoma (N = 2). Five of 20 patients (25 %) had metastatic melanoma found at the time of SLNB. Patients with melanoma had a tenfold increase of CLL diagnosis compared with colorectal cancer patients, an eightfold increase compared to prostate cancer patients, and a fourfold increase compared with breast cancer patients.

Milatuzumab-conjugated liposomes as targeted dexamethasone carriers for therapeutic delivery in CD74+ B-cell malignancies.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2012-12-03,"Corticosteroids are widely used for the treatment of B-cell malignancies, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia; however, this class of drug is associated with undesirable off-target effects. Herein, we developed novel milatuzumab-conjugated liposomes as a targeted dexamethasone carrier for therapeutic delivery in CD74(+) B-cell malignancies and explored its effect against the disease. The targeting efficiency of milatuzumab-targeted liposomes to CD74(+) cells was evaluated in vitro. The effect of CD74-targeted liposomal dexamethasone was compared with free dexamethasone in primary CLL cells and cell lines in vitro. The therapeutic efficacy of CD74-targeted liposomal dexamethasone was evaluated in a Raji-severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) xenograft model in vivo. Milatuzumab-targeted liposomes promoted selective incorporation of carrier molecules into transformed CD74-positive B cells as compared with CD74-negative T-cells.

Impact of age on outcomes after initial therapy with chemotherapy and different chemoimmunotherapy regimens in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia: results of sequential cancer and leukemia group B studies.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2012-12-10,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a disease of the elderly, yet few clinical trials include a significant number of older patients, and outcomes after specific therapies can be different depending on age. We examined patients enrolled onto successive first-line CALGB CLL trials to determine whether efficacy of regimens varied by age, focusing on ideal chemotherapy choice and benefit of immunotherapy addition to chemotherapy in older patients. Regimens included chlorambucil, fludarabine, fludarabine plus rituximab (FR), fludarabine with consolidation alemtuzumab, and FR with consolidation alemtuzumab. A total of 663 patients were evaluated for response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) by age group. Interaction effects of fludarabine versus chlorambucil by age group (PFS, P = .046; OS, P = .006) showed that among patients younger than 70 years, PFS and OS was improved with fludarabine over chlorambucil (PFS: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.6, 95% CI, 0.5 to 0.8; OS: HR = 0.7, 95% CI, 0.5 to 0.9), but not in older adults (PFS, HR = 1.0, 95% CI, 0.6 to 1.7; OS: HR = 1.5, 95% CI, 0.9 to 2.3).

Alemtuzumab consolidation did not provide benefit over similar regimens without alemtuzumab (P > .20), irrespective of age.

Azacitidine in fludarabine-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a phase II study.,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2012-12-21,"Treatment of fludarabine-refractory disease in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains a challenge. Because a recent genome-wide methylation analysis of CLL cells suggested that demethylation therapy might be beneficial in CLL, we conducted a phase II trial with the hypomethylating agent azacitidine in patients with recurrent fludarabine-refractory CLL. Nine patients with recurrent fludarabine-refractory Rai stage IV CLL (median age, 74 years; range, 49-81 years) were enrolled. Azacitidine (75 mg/m(2)) was administered by subcutaneous injection daily for 7 consecutive days every 3 to 8 weeks, and the data were analyzed at a median follow-up of 9 months (range 3-47 months). The trial was prematurely discontinued because of lack of response and slow accrual. The number of cycles administered ranged from 1 to 6. Three patients received 1 cycle, 3 patients received 2 cycles, and the remaining 3 patients received 4, 5, or 6 cycles. Side effects included grade 2 or 3 infectious episodes (resulting from immunosuppression and drug-induced neutropenia), diarrhea, rash, vomiting, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. One patient experienced reduction of hepatosplenomegaly and a substantial increase in platelet count after 4 cycles of therapy. However this response did not qualify as a partial response according to the National Cancer Institute International Workshop on CLL (NCI-IWCLL) criteria. At a median follow-up of 9 months after the start of azacitidine treatment, 3 patients (33%) who went on to receive other treatments were alive. Although no partial or complete responses occurred in these heavily pretreated patients, the encouraging response in 1 of these patients may warrant further studies to investigate the effects of azacitidine in CLL.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",2587.0,9.0,Treatment of fludarabine-refractory disease in patients with chronic lymphocytic CLL remains a challenge Because a recent genome-wide methylation analysis of CLL cells suggested that demethylation therapy might be beneficial in CLL we conducted a phase II trial with the hypomethylating agent azacitidine in patients with recurrent fludarabine-refractory CLL Nine patients with recurrent fludarabine-refractory Rai stage IV CLL median age 74 years range 49-81 years were enrolled Azacitidine 75 mg/m 2 was administered by subcutaneous injection daily for 7 consecutive days every 3 to 8 weeks and the data were analyzed at a median follow-up of 9 months range 3-47 months The trial was prematurely discontinued because of lack of response and slow accrual The number of cycles administered ranged from 1 to 6 Three patients received 1 cycle 3 patients received 2 cycles and the remaining 3 patients received 4 5 or 6 cycles Side effects included grade 2 or 3 infectious episodes resulting from immunosuppression and drug-induced neutropenia diarrhea rash vomiting anemia and thrombocytopenia One patient experienced reduction of hepatosplenomegaly and a substantial increase in platelet count after 4 cycles of therapy However this response did not qualify as a partial response according to the National Cancer Institute International Workshop on CLL NCI-IWCLL criteria At a median follow-up of 9 months after the start of azacitidine treatment 3 patients 33 who went on to receive other treatments were alive Although no partial or complete responses occurred in these heavily pretreated patients the encouraging response in 1 of these patients may warrant further studies to investigate the effects of azacitidine in CLL,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[24, 1, 2027, 430, 34, 4, 7, 5, 442, 1193, 552, 469, 8, 1745, 408, 8, 435, 898, 1019, 569, 65, 1, 552, 37, 1148, 17, 6800, 36, 822, 40, 2524, 4, 552, 21, 426, 8, 124, 215, 160, 5, 3, 4931, 420, 3752, 4, 7, 5, 387, 2027, 430, 552, 762, 7, 5, 387, 2027, 430, 4121, 82, 478, 552, 52, 89, 794, 60, 184, 739, 865, 60, 11, 346, 3752, 481, 81, 188, 18, 10, 468, 20, 2529, 1754, 391, 9, 67, 935, 162, 454, 27, 6, 66, 244, 2, 3, 74, 11, 311, 28, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 83, 53, 184, 27, 662, 53, 3, 160, 10, 9771, 2402, 408, 1, 926, 1, 51, 2, 3645, 2262, 3, 207, 1, 410, 468, 1869, 29, 14, 6, 49, 169, 7, 103, 14, 417, 27, 7, 103, 18, 410, 2, 3, 1844, 27, 7, 103, 39, 33, 15, 49, 410, 1152, 176, 159, 88, 18, 15, 27, 3398, 3750, 1113, 29, 3646, 2, 234, 277, 778, 1172, 1641, 1966, 1545, 2, 1340, 104, 69, 592, 628, 1, 15144, 2, 8, 1281, 344, 4, 1596, 1276, 50, 39, 410, 1, 36, 137, 26, 51, 205, 44, 13657, 22, 8, 450, 51, 768, 6, 3, 657, 12, 1377, 944, 4014, 23, 552, 2580, 16575, 371, 28, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 83, 53, 50, 3, 2435, 1, 3752, 24, 27, 7, 466, 54, 7109, 23, 6, 560, 127, 640, 11, 1701, 242, 77, 450, 15, 236, 253, 489, 4, 46, 2447, 2193, 7, 3, 2269, 51, 4, 14, 1, 46, 7, 68, 2946, 195, 94, 6, 963, 3, 176, 1, 3752, 4, 552]",1723.0,23265768,150
Phase II study of lenalidomide and rituximab as salvage therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2012-12-26,"Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug active as salvage therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We combined lenalidomide with rituximab to improve response rates in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. Fifty-nine adult patients (age 42 to 82 years) with relapsed or refractory CLL were enrolled onto a phase II study of lenalidomide and rituximab. Patients had received prior fludarabine-based therapy or chemoimmunotherapy. Rituximab (375 mg/m(2) intravenously) was administered weekly during cycle one and on day 1 of cycles three to 12. Lenalidomide was started on day 9 of cycle one at 10 mg orally and administered daily continuously. Each cycle was 28 days. Rituximab was administered for 12 cycles; lenalidomide could continue indefinitely if patients benefitted clinically. The overall response rate was 66%, including 12% complete responses and 12% nodular partial remissions. Time to treatment failure was 17.4 months. Median overall survival has not been reached; estimated survival at 36 months is 71%. The most common grade 3 or 4 toxicity was neutropenia (73% of patients).

Genomic variation by whole-genome SNP mapping arrays predicts time-to-event outcome in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a comparison of CLL and HapMap genotypes.,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,J Mol Diagn,2012-12-27,"Genomic abnormalities, such as deletions in 11q22 or 17p13, are associated with poorer prognosis in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We hypothesized that unknown regions of copy number variation (CNV) affect clinical outcome and can be detected by array-based single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. We compared SNP genotypes from 168 untreated patients with CLL with genotypes from 73 white HapMap controls. We identified 322 regions of recurrent CNV, 82 of which occurred significantly more often in CLL than in HapMap (CLL-specific CNV), including regions typically aberrant in CLL: deletions in 6q21, 11q22, 13q14, and 17p13 and trisomy 12. In univariate analyses, 35 of total and 11 of CLL-specific CNVs were associated with unfavorable time-to-event outcomes, including gains or losses in chromosomes 2p, 4p, 4q, 6p, 6q, 7q, 11p, 11q, and 17p. In multivariate analyses, six CNVs (ie, CLL-specific variations in 11p15.1-15.4 or 6q27) predicted time-to-treatment or overall survival independently of established markers of prognosis. Moreover, genotypic complexity (ie, the number of independent CNVs per patient) significantly predicted prognosis, with a median time-to-treatment of 64 months versus 23 months in patients with zero to one versus two or more CNVs, respectively (P = 3.3 × 10(-8)).

A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model of tumor lysis syndrome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients treated with flavopiridol.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2013-01-08,"Flavopiridol, the first clinically evaluated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, shows activity in patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but prevalent and unpredictable tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) presents a major barrier to its broad clinical use. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between pretreatment risk factors, drug pharmacokinetics, and TLS. A population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model linking drug exposure and TLS was developed. Plasma data of flavopiridol and its glucuronide metabolite (flavo-G) were obtained from 111 patients treated in early-phase trials with frequent sampling following initial and/or escalated doses. TLS grading was modeled with logistic regression as a pharmacodynamic endpoint. Demographics, baseline disease status, and blood chemistry variables were evaluated as covariates. Gender was the most significant pharmacokinetic covariate, with females displaying higher flavo-G exposure than males. Glucuronide metabolite exposure was predictive of TLS occurrence, and bulky lymphadenopathy was identified as a significant covariate on TLS probability. The estimated probability of TLS occurrence in patients with baseline bulky lymphadenopathy less than 10 cm or 10 cm or more during the first 2 treatments was 0.111 (SE% 13.0%) and 0.265 (SE% 17.9%), respectively, when flavo-G area under the plasma concentration versus time curve was at its median value in whole-patient group.

Mapping of the IRF8 gene identifies a 3'UTR variant associated with risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia but not other common non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes.,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev.,2013-01-10,"Our genome-wide association study (GWAS) of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) identified 4 highly correlated intronic variants within the IRF8 gene that were associated with CLL. These results were further supported by a recent meta-analysis of our GWAS with two other GWAS of CLL, supporting the IRF8 gene as a strong candidate for CLL risk. To refine the genetic association of CLL risk, we conducted Sanger sequencing of IRF8 in 94 CLL cases and 96 controls. We then conducted fine mapping by genotyping 39 variants (of which 10 were identified from sequencing) in 745 CLL cases and 1,521 controls. We also assessed these associations with risk of other non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes. The strongest association with CLL risk was observed with a common single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located within the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of IRF8 (rs1044873, log additive OR = 0.7, P = 1.81 × 10(-6)). This SNP was not associated with the other NHL subtypes (all P > 0.05). We provide evidence that rs1044873 in the IRF8 gene accounts for the initial GWAS signal for CLL risk. This association appears to be unique to CLL with little support for association with other common NHL subtypes. Future work is needed to assess functional role of IRF8 in CLL etiology.

"Overall and cancer-specific survival of patients with breast, colon, kidney, and lung cancers with and without chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a SEER population-based study.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2013-01-22,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is associated with an increased risk of developing second cancers. However, it is unknown whether CLL alters the disease course of these cancers once they occur. All patients with cancers of the breast (n = 579,164), colorectum (n = 412,366), prostate (n = 631,616), lung (n = 489,053), kidney (n = 95,795), pancreas (n = 82,116), and ovary (n = 61,937) reported to the SEER program from 1990 to 2007 were identified. Overall survival (OS; death resulting from any cause) and cancer-specific survival were examined, comparing patients with and without pre-existing CLL. Cancer-specific survival was evaluated for each tumor type in a site-specific manner (eg, death resulting from breast cancer in a patient with breast cancer). Patients with cancers of the breast (hazard ratio [HR], 1.70; P < .001), colorectum (HR, 1.65; P < .001), kidney (HR, 1.54; P < .001), prostate (HR, 1.92; P < .001), or lung (HR, 1.19; P < .001) had inferior OS if they had a pre-existing diagnosis of CLL after adjusting for age, sex, race, and disease stage. These results for OS remained significant for patients with cancers of the breast, colorectum, and prostate after excluding or censoring CLL-related deaths. Cancer-specific survival was also inferior for patients with cancers of the breast (HR, 1.41; P = .005) and colorectum (HR, 1.46; P < .001) who had pre-existing CLL after adjusting for age, sex, race, and disease stage.

Germline allele-specific expression of DAPK1 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2013-01-28,"We previously reported a rare germline variant (c.1-6531) that resulted in allele-specific expression (ASE) of death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) and predisposition to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We investigated a cohort of CLL patients lacking this mutation for the presence of ASE of DAPK1. We developed a novel strategy that combines single-nucleotide primer extension (SNuPE) with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and detected germline DAPK1 ASE in 17 out of 120 (14.2%) CLL patients associated with a trend towards younger age at diagnosis. ASE was absent in 63 healthy controls. Germline cells of CLL patients with ASE showed increased levels of DNA methylation in the promoter region, however, neither genetic nor further epigenetic aberrations could be identified in the DAPK1 5' upstream regulatory region, within distinct exons or in the 3'-UTR. We identified B-lymphoid malignancy related cell line models harboring allelic imbalance and found that allele-specific methylation in DAPK1 is associated with ASE.

Low-dose involved-field radiation in the treatment of non-hodgkin lymphoma: predictors of response and treatment failure.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2013-02-12,"To investigate clinical and pathologic factors significant in predicting local response and time to further treatment after low-dose involved-field radiation therapy (LD-IFRT) for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Records of NHL patients treated at a single institution between April 2004 and September 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Low-dose involved-field radiation therapy was given as 4 Gy in 2 fractions over 2 consecutive days. Treatment response and disease control were determined by radiographic studies and/or physical examination. A generalized estimating equation model was used to assess the effect of tumor and patient characteristics on disease response. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess time to further treatment. We treated a total of 187 sites in 127 patients with LD-IFRT. Histologies included 66% follicular, 9% chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma, 10% marginal zone, 6% mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and 8% other. Median follow-up time was 23.4 months (range, 0.03-92.2 months). The complete response, partial response, and overall response rates were 57%, 25%, and 82%, respectively. A CLL histology was associated with a lower response rate (odds ratio 0.2, 95% confidence interval 0.1-0.5, P=.02). Tumor size, site, age at diagnosis, and prior systemic therapy were not associated with response. The median time to first recurrence was 13.6 months. Those with CLL and age ≤ 50 years at diagnosis had a shorter time to further treatment for local failures (hazard ratio [HR] 3.63, P=.01 and HR 5.50, P=.02, respectively).

We sampled leukemia cells from 18 patients at two time points. Ten of twelve CLL cases treated with chemotherapy (but only one of six without treatment) underwent clonal evolution, predominantly involving subclones with driver mutations (e.g., SF3B1 and TP53) that expanded over time. Furthermore, presence of a subclonal driver mutation was an independent risk factor for rapid disease progression.

Rituximab is an anti-CD20 Ab that prolongs survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients when combined with chemotherapy. Ofatumumab and GA101 (obinutuzumab) are CD20-directed Abs currently being developed as alternative agents to rituximab in CLL based upon different properties of enhanced direct cell death, NK cell-mediated Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, or complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Despite widespread study, ofatumumab and GA101 have not been compared with each other, nor studied for their interactions with monocytes and macrophages which are critical for the efficacy of anti-CD20 Abs in murine models. In CLL cells, we show that direct cell death and complement-dependent cytotoxicity are greatest with GA101 and ofatumumab, respectively. GA101 promotes enhanced NK cell activation and Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity at high Ab concentrations. Ofatumumab elicits superior Ab-dependent cellular phagocytosis with monocyte-derived macrophages. GA101 demonstrated reduced activation of monocytes with diminished pERK, TNF-α release, and FcγRIIa recruitment to lipid rafts.

Autophagy and ER stress play an essential role in the mechanism of action and drug resistance of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol.,Autophagy,Autophagy,2013-03-01,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a mature B cell malignancy and is the most prevalent type of leukemia in adults. There is no curative therapy for this disease; however, several new agents have shown very promising results. Autophagy has not been studied in CLL and in this study we first sought to determine if autophagy was functional in CLL with classic inducers, and if this contributes to direct cytotoxicity or protection from cell death. While autophagy is activated with all classic stimuli of this process, only unfolded protein endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated autophagy protects from cell death. Interestingly, select therapeutic agents (fludarabine, GS-1101, flavopiridol), which are active in CLL, also induce autophagy. Of interest, only the broad cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol has improved efficacy when autophagy is antagonized biochemically (chloroquine) or by siRNA. This promoted an investigation which demonstrated unexpectedly that flavopiridol mediates ER stress and downstream activation of MAP3K5/ASK1, which ultimately is responsible for cell death. Similarly, autophagy activated in part via ER stress and also CDK5 inhibition is protective against cell death induced by this process. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that in CLL, autophagy is induced by multiple stimuli but only acts as a mechanism of resistance against ER stress-mediating agents. Similarly, flavopiridol mediates ER stress as a primary mechanism of action in CLL, and autophagy serves as a mechanism of resistance to this agent.",Journal Article,2517.0,,Chronic lymphocytic CLL is a mature B cell malignancy and is the most prevalent type of in adults There is no curative therapy for this disease however several new agents have shown very promising results Autophagy has not been studied in CLL and in this study we first sought to determine if autophagy was functional in CLL with classic inducers and if this contributes to direct cytotoxicity or protection from cell death While autophagy is activated with all classic stimuli of this process only unfolded protein endoplasmic reticulum ER stress-mediated autophagy protects from cell death Interestingly select therapeutic agents fludarabine GS-1101 flavopiridol which are active in CLL also induce autophagy Of interest only the broad cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol has improved efficacy when autophagy is antagonized biochemically chloroquine or by siRNA This promoted an investigation which demonstrated unexpectedly that flavopiridol mediates ER stress and downstream activation of MAP3K5/ASK1 which ultimately is responsible for cell death Similarly autophagy activated in part via ER stress and also CDK5 inhibition is protective against cell death induced by this process Collectively our studies demonstrate that in CLL autophagy is induced by multiple stimuli but only acts as a mechanism of resistance against ER stress-mediating agents Similarly flavopiridol mediates ER stress as a primary mechanism of action in CLL and autophagy serves as a mechanism of resistance to this agent,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[442, 1193, 552, 16, 8, 2908, 132, 31, 710, 2, 16, 3, 96, 2485, 267, 1, 4, 857, 125, 16, 77, 1075, 36, 9, 26, 34, 137, 392, 217, 183, 47, 443, 923, 721, 99, 2240, 71, 44, 85, 656, 4, 552, 2, 4, 26, 45, 21, 157, 990, 6, 223, 492, 2240, 10, 583, 4, 552, 5, 3168, 12780, 2, 492, 26, 2444, 6, 1196, 1408, 15, 3525, 29, 31, 273, 369, 2240, 16, 735, 5, 62, 3168, 7478, 1, 26, 1129, 158, 12146, 178, 6057, 6078, 516, 1531, 517, 2240, 8170, 29, 31, 273, 2873, 1717, 189, 183, 2027, 3815, 15129, 3030, 92, 32, 544, 4, 552, 120, 1290, 2240, 1, 1333, 158, 3, 2094, 1226, 470, 216, 230, 3030, 71, 231, 209, 198, 2240, 16, 15259, 7944, 14325, 15, 20, 1919, 26, 2992, 35, 940, 92, 264, 6016, 17, 3030, 3961, 516, 1531, 2, 1489, 363, 1, 26630, 31994, 92, 2050, 16, 2327, 9, 31, 273, 1813, 2240, 735, 4, 760, 847, 516, 1531, 2, 120, 16967, 297, 16, 2864, 480, 31, 273, 277, 20, 26, 1129, 2535, 114, 94, 608, 17, 4, 552, 2240, 16, 277, 20, 232, 7478, 84, 158, 4459, 22, 8, 670, 1, 251, 480, 516, 1531, 3941, 183, 1813, 3030, 3961, 516, 1531, 22, 8, 86, 670, 1, 1578, 4, 552, 2, 2240, 4711, 22, 8, 670, 1, 251, 6, 26, 420]",1510.0,23422081,538
Systemic mastocytosis with associated clonal hematological non-mast cell lineage disease: clinical significance and comparison of chomosomal abnormalities in SM and AHNMD components.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2013-03-01,"Some patients with systemic mastocytosis have concurrent hematological neoplasms, designated in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification as systemic mastocytosis with associated clonal hematological non-mast cell lineage disease (SM-AHNMD). In this study, we analyzed 29 patients with SM-AHNMD and compared them to 40 patients with pure SM. The AHNMDs were classified as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (n = 10), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (n = 7), myeloproliferative neoplasms (n = 4), B-cell lymphoma/leukemia/plasma cell neoplasms (n = 7), and acute myeloid leukemia (n = 1). Patients with SM-AHNMD were older, more frequently had constitutional symptoms and hematological abnormalities, less often had skin lesions, and had an inferior overall survival compared with pure SM patients (48 months vs. not-reached, P < 0.001). Karyotypic abnormalities were detected in 9/28 (32%) patients with SM-AHNMD but not in pure SM patients (P < 0.001). Combined imaging/ fluorescence-in-situ hybridization performed in four SM-AHNMD cases revealed shared abnormal signals in mast cells and myeloid cells in two patients with SM-CMML and one patient with SM-MDS, but not in the mast cells of a case SM-associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia with ATM-deletion.

Identification of endoplasmic reticulum stress-inducing agents by antagonizing autophagy: a new potential strategy for identification of anti-cancer therapeutics in B-cell malignancies.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2013-04-16,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays a vital function in multiple cellular processes. There is a growing interest in developing therapeutic agents that can target the ER in cancer cells, inducing a stress response that leads to cell death. However, ER stress-inducing agents can also induce autophagy, a survival strategy of cancer cells. Therefore, by inhibiting autophagy we can increase the efficacy of the ER stress-inducing agents. Nelfinavir, a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor with anti-cancer properties, can induce ER stress. Nelfinavir's effects on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are yet to be elucidated. Herein we demonstrate that nelfinavir induces ER morphological changes and stress response, along with an autophagic protective strategy.

Emerging drug profile: cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2013-07-29,"Abstract As the rational application of targeted therapies in cancer supplants traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy, there is an ever-greater need for a thorough understanding of the complex machinery of the cell and an application of this knowledge to the development of novel therapeutics and combinations of agents. Here, we review the current state of knowledge of the class of targeted agents known as cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, with a focus on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Flavopiridol (alvocidib) is the best studied of the CDK inhibitors, producing a dramatic cytotoxic effect in vitro and in vivo, with the principal limiting factor of acute tumor lysis. Unfortunately, flavopiridol has a narrow therapeutic window and is relatively non-selective with several off-target (i.e. non-CDK) effects, which prompted development of the second-generation CDK inhibitor dinaciclib.

Long-term repair of T-cell synapse activity in a phase II trial of chemoimmunotherapy followed by lenalidomide consolidation in previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).,Blood,Blood,2013-03-14,"Immunotherapy that facilitates endogenous T-cell activity has the potential to target therapy-resistant tumor clones. In vitro studies have demonstrated that lenalidomide repairs the T-cell immunologic synapse defect in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (PCR) in CLL is clinically active with modest toxicity, indicating suitability of this chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) platform for combination with immunotherapy. Here we report on a trial of PCR followed by lenalidomide consolidation. Of 34 patients who received lenalidomide, 24% improved their quality of response and 4 patients converted to minimal residual disease negative status. Retrospective comparison to a historical PCR trial indicated that lenalidomide consolidation extends time to progression requiring salvage therapy. Longitudinal analysis showed that antitumor T-cell immune synapse activity improved post-PCR and was further enhanced after lenalidomide consolidation. These novel data showing repair of T-cell defects provide proof-of-principle that lenalidomide-based consolidation after CIT could have a beneficial clinical and immunologic role in CLL.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",2504.0,63.0,Immunotherapy that facilitates endogenous T-cell activity has the potential to target therapy-resistant tumor clones In vitro studies have demonstrated that lenalidomide repairs the T-cell immunologic synapse defect in chronic lymphocytic CLL Pentostatin cyclophosphamide and rituximab PCR in CLL is clinically active with modest toxicity indicating suitability of this chemoimmunotherapy CIT platform for combination with immunotherapy Here we report on a trial of PCR followed by lenalidomide consolidation Of 34 patients who received lenalidomide 24 improved their quality of response and 4 patients converted to minimal residual disease negative status Retrospective comparison to a historical PCR trial indicated that lenalidomide consolidation extends time to progression requiring salvage therapy Longitudinal analysis showed that antitumor T-cell immune synapse activity improved post-PCR and was further enhanced after lenalidomide consolidation These novel data showing repair of T-cell defects provide proof-of-principle that lenalidomide-based consolidation after CIT could have a beneficial clinical and immunologic role in CLL,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[726, 17, 4936, 2682, 102, 31, 128, 71, 3, 174, 6, 283, 36, 436, 30, 2749, 4, 439, 94, 47, 264, 17, 1288, 18439, 3, 102, 31, 3042, 15533, 5398, 4, 442, 1193, 552, 7596, 1112, 2, 855, 604, 4, 552, 16, 505, 544, 5, 1721, 155, 1716, 10163, 1, 26, 4438, 9192, 2243, 9, 150, 5, 726, 467, 21, 414, 23, 8, 160, 1, 604, 370, 20, 1288, 2173, 1, 562, 7, 54, 103, 1288, 259, 231, 136, 372, 1, 51, 2, 39, 7, 4764, 6, 1048, 753, 34, 199, 156, 459, 1155, 6, 8, 2252, 604, 160, 1103, 17, 1288, 2173, 8464, 98, 6, 91, 1888, 992, 36, 2380, 65, 224, 17, 579, 102, 31, 250, 15533, 128, 231, 539, 604, 2, 10, 195, 651, 50, 1288, 2173, 46, 229, 74, 2069, 972, 1, 102, 31, 2945, 377, 3840, 1, 4968, 17, 1288, 90, 2173, 50, 9192, 359, 47, 8, 2524, 38, 2, 3042, 200, 4, 552]",1140.0,23493782,55

The proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib functions independently of p53 to induce cytotoxicity and an atypical NF-κB response in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2013-03-20,"The proteasome consists of chymotrypsin-like (CT-L), trypsin-like, and caspase-like subunits that cleave substrates preferentially by amino acid sequence. Proteasomes mediate degradation of regulatory proteins of the p53, Bcl-2, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) families that are aberrantly active in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CLL remains an incurable disease, and new treatments are especially needed in the relapsed/refractory setting. We therefore investigated the effects of the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib (CFZ) in CLL cells. Tumor cells from CLL patients were assayed in vitro using immunoblotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In addition, a p53 dominant-negative construct was generated in a human B-cell line. Unlike bortezomib, CFZ potently induces apoptosis in CLL patient cells in the presence of human serum. CLL cells have significantly lower basal CT-L activity compared to normal B and T cells, although activity is inhibited similarly in T cells versus CLL. Co-culture of CLL cells on stroma protected from CFZ-mediated cytotoxicity; however, PI3K inhibition significantly diminished this stromal protection. CFZ-mediated cytotoxicity in leukemic B cells is caspase-dependent and occurs irrespective of p53 status. In CLL cells, CFZ promotes atypical activation of NF-κB evidenced by loss of cytoplasmic IκBα, phosphorylation of IκBα, and increased p50/p65 DNA binding, without subsequent increases in canonical NF-κB target gene transcription. Together, these data provide new mechanistic insights into the activity of CFZ in CLL and support phase I investigation of CFZ in this disease.",Journal Article,2498.0,24.0,The proteasome consists of chymotrypsin-like CT-L trypsin-like and caspase-like subunits that cleave substrates preferentially by amino acid sequence Proteasomes mediate degradation of regulatory proteins of the p53 Bcl-2 and nuclear factor-κB NF-κB families that are aberrantly active in chronic lymphocytic CLL CLL remains an incurable disease and new treatments are especially needed in the relapsed/refractory setting We therefore investigated the effects of the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib CFZ in CLL cells Tumor cells from CLL patients were assayed in vitro using immunoblotting real-time polymerase chain reaction and electrophoretic mobility shift assays In addition a p53 dominant-negative construct was generated in a human B-cell line Unlike bortezomib CFZ potently induces apoptosis in CLL patient cells in the presence of human serum CLL cells have significantly lower basal CT-L activity compared to normal B and T cells although activity is inhibited similarly in T cells versus CLL Co-culture of CLL cells on stroma protected from CFZ-mediated cytotoxicity however PI3K inhibition significantly diminished this stromal protection CFZ-mediated cytotoxicity in leukemic B cells is caspase-dependent and occurs irrespective of p53 status In CLL cells CFZ promotes atypical activation of NF-κB evidenced by loss of cytoplasmic IκBα phosphorylation of IκBα and increased p50/p65 DNA binding without subsequent increases in canonical NF-κB target gene transcription Together these data provide new mechanistic insights into the activity of CFZ in CLL and support phase I investigation of CFZ in this disease,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1694, 5132, 1, 19118, 733, 425, 805, 15990, 733, 2, 1469, 733, 6166, 17, 23247, 6063, 3509, 20, 3078, 971, 1532, 24715, 3367, 2373, 1, 1253, 652, 1, 3, 624, 1044, 18, 2, 928, 161, 2448, 1365, 2448, 1954, 17, 32, 5619, 544, 4, 442, 1193, 552, 552, 469, 35, 2641, 34, 2, 217, 640, 32, 1093, 575, 4, 3, 591, 430, 546, 21, 673, 565, 3, 176, 1, 3, 1694, 230, 3668, 13427, 4, 552, 37, 30, 37, 29, 552, 7, 11, 4499, 4, 439, 75, 5293, 1589, 98, 1451, 1260, 1329, 2, 10980, 5717, 3024, 1013, 4, 352, 8, 624, 2156, 199, 3883, 10, 1419, 4, 8, 171, 132, 31, 328, 4246, 819, 13427, 4684, 1516, 351, 4, 552, 69, 37, 4, 3, 463, 1, 171, 524, 552, 37, 47, 97, 280, 2135, 425, 805, 128, 72, 6, 295, 132, 2, 102, 37, 242, 128, 16, 879, 1813, 4, 102, 37, 185, 552, 1269, 2099, 1, 552, 37, 23, 2477, 5541, 29, 13427, 517, 1408, 137, 974, 297, 97, 2849, 26, 1126, 3525, 13427, 517, 1408, 4, 2015, 132, 37, 16, 1469, 470, 2, 1780, 3500, 1, 624, 156, 4, 552, 37, 13427, 2148, 1973, 363, 1, 1365, 2448, 4728, 20, 407, 1, 2828, 15032, 982, 1, 15032, 2, 101, 16197, 6781, 261, 791, 187, 706, 1106, 4, 4471, 1365, 2448, 283, 145, 866, 1162, 46, 74, 377, 217, 2716, 1957, 237, 3, 128, 1, 13427, 4, 552, 2, 538, 124, 70, 940, 1, 13427, 4, 26, 34]",1622.0,23515408,378

We have developed a regimen that targets CD4(+) lymphodepletion to ensure early and durable engraftment. The primary endpoint was achievement of ≥50% CD3(+) donor chimerism by day +28. Forty-two patients (median age, 53 years; range, 29 to 73 years) received pentostatin 4 mg/m(2) i.v. on days -28, -21, and -14 when the CD4(+) cell count was >100 cells/μL and on days -4 and -3 regardless of CD4(+) level. Rituximab 375 mg/m(2) was administered to patients with CD20(+) malignancies on days -21, -14, -7, +1, and +8. Busulfan 200 mg/m(2) i.v. was administered on days -4 and -2 at a dose to target a cumulative AUC dose of 16,000 (±10%) μmol·min/L. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus plus methotrexate in 86% of patients. Donors were matched-related (47%), matched unrelated (43%), or mismatched unrelated (10%). Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (45%) and follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma (14%) were the most common diagnoses. Disease status at initiation of the preparative regimen was complete remission in 22%, partial response in 55%, and stable/progression in 24%.

A phase I study of escalated dose subcutaneous alemtuzumab given weekly with rituximab in relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma.,Haematologica,Haematologica,2013-05-03,"This study assessed the safety and preliminary efficacy of escalated dose subcutaneous alemtuzumab in combination with rituximab in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Twenty-eight patients with relapsed refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia were treated on four dosing cohorts of weekly rituximab at 375 mg/m(2) and alemtuzumab doses that started at 30 mg three times per week and escalated to weekly dosing over four weeks, culminating with 90 mg weekly. One dose limiting toxicity of a rituximab infusion reaction was seen in cohort 2, but the regimen was otherwise well tolerated without evidence of differential toxicity by cohort. The overall response rate by National Cancer Institute-Working Group criteria was 61%, and the rate of complete bone marrow response was 43%, most of whom were negative for minimal residual disease. The addition of CT scan evaluation per International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 2008 criteria reduced the overall response rate to 14%. Median overall survival was 35 months, with 12 patients able to proceed to stem cell transplantation. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that chronic lymphocytic leukemia involving more than 80% of the bone marrow at study start was associated with lower trough concentrations of alemtuzumab and rituximab, and that higher trough serum concentrations of alemtuzumab were associated with complete bone marrow clearance. We conclude that escalated subcutaneous doses of alemtuzumab given weekly are well tolerated and result in excellent bone marrow clearance of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, helping patients to proceed to stem cell transplantation.

Adoptively transferred TRAIL+ T cells suppress GVHD and augment antitumor activity.,The Journal of clinical investigation,J. Clin. Invest.,2013-05-15,"Current strategies to suppress graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) also compromise graft-versus-tumor (GVT) responses. Furthermore, most experimental strategies to separate GVHD and GVT responses merely spare GVT function without actually enhancing it. We have previously shown that endogenously expressed TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is required for optimal GVT activity against certain malignancies in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). In order to model a donor-derived cellular therapy, we genetically engineered T cells to overexpress TRAIL and adoptively transferred donor-type unsorted TRAIL+ T cells into mouse models of allo-HSCT. We found that murine TRAIL+ T cells induced apoptosis of alloreactive T cells, thereby reducing GVHD in a DR5-dependent manner. Furthermore, murine TRAIL+ T cells mediated enhanced in vitro and in vivo antilymphoma GVT response.

Individualizing treatment decisions for older adults with hematologic malignancies.,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book. American Society of Clinical Oncology. Annual Meeting,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,2013-01-01,"Hematologic malignancies are a common cause of morbidity and mortality among older adults, who represent the majority of patients diagnosed with these diseases. Treatment options and disease outcomes have improved in recent years because of the development of novel treatment strategies and the design of elderly-specific clinical trials. Despite this, extrapolation of clinical trial data to patients routinely seen in practice is challenging because of the presence of multimorbidity and functional impairments. Individualized treatment decision making requires not only an understanding of underlying tumor biology but also careful estimation of an older patient's anticipated ability to withstand the stresses of therapy.

Because miR levels are deregulated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 is constitutively activated in CLL, we sought to determine whether STAT3 affects the transcription of miR genes in CLL cells. We used publically available data from the ENCODE project to identify putative STAT3 binding sites in the promoters of miR genes. Then we transfected CLL cells with STAT3-shRNA or with an empty vector, and to determine which miRs are differentially expressed, we used a miR microarray approach followed by validation of the microarray results for 6 miRs using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We identified putative STAT3 binding sites in 160 promoter regions of 200 miRs, including miR-21, miR-29, and miR-155, whose levels have been reported to be upregulated in CLL.

Targeted drug delivery and cross-linking induced apoptosis with anti-CD37 based dual-ligand immunoliposomes in B chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.,Biomaterials,Biomaterials,2013-05-28,"Despite advances in chemo and immunotherapeutic agents for B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), the undesirable adverse side effects due to non-specific cellular uptake remain to be addressed. We identified anti-CD37 monoclonal antibody immunoliposomes (ILs) as vehicles for targeted delivery to B chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. To achieve maximal benefits for all patients, a new strategy of dual-ligand immunoliposomes (dILs) was developed. A combinatorial antibody microarray technology was adapted to quickly identify optimal antibody combinations for individual patient cells. For proof-of-concept, a B-cell specific antibody, either anti-CD19 or anti-CD20, was combined with anti-CD37 to construct dILs with enhanced selectivity and efficacy. Consistent with data from the antibody microarray, these dILs provided highly specific targeting to both leukemia cell lines and B-CLL patient cells. Compared with the single antibody ILs, the anti-CD19/CD37 dILs clearly demonstrated superior delivery efficiency and apoptosis induction to B-CLL patient cells, whereas the anti-CD20/anti-CD37 dILs were found to be the most efficient for delivery to leukemia cell lines.

Association of health-related quality of life with gender in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,Support Care Cancer,2013-06-08,"This analysis examined associations between gender and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as they initiate therapy for CLL outside the clinical trial setting. Baseline data were collected as part of Connect® CLL Registry, a prospective observational study initiated in community, academic, and government centers. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were provided by clinicians. Patients reported HRQOL using the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), EQ-5D, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia (FACT-Leu). Mean scores were analyzed, with statistical significance of differences determined by ANOVA. Multivariate analysis also considered age and line of therapy. Baseline HRQOL data were available for 1,140 patients: 710 (62 %) men and 430 (38 %) women from 161 centers. Patients were predominantly white (89 %) with mean age 69 ± 11 years. Women reported significantly worse global fatigue (P <0.0001), fatigue severity (P <0.0001), and fatigue-related interference (P = 0.0005) versus men (BFI). Pain/discomfort (P = 0.0077), usual activities (P = 0.0015), and anxiety/depression (P = 0.0117) were significantly worse in women than in men (EQ-5D). With women reporting a better social/family score (P = 0.0238) and men reporting a better physical score (P = 0.0002), the mean FACT-G total score did not differ by gender. However, the mean FACT-Leu total score was better among men versus women (P = 0.0223), primarily because the mean leukemia subscale score was significantly better among men (P <0.0001).

Preclinical and clinical evaluation of forodesine in pediatric and adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2013-06-15,"The discovery that purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency leads to T-cell lymphopenia was the basis for introducing PNP inhibitors for T-cell leukemias. Forodesine is an orally bioavailable PNP inhibitor with picomolar potency. Because T lymphoblasts and indolent chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells inherently elicit favorable pharmacokinetics to accumulate deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP), forodesine demonstrated promising activity in preclinical and clinical settings for patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and B-cell CLL (B-CLL). However, the use of forodesine in B-cell ALL (B-ALL) is unknown. Leukemic blasts obtained from pediatric patients with de novo B-ALL (n = 10) were incubated with forodesine and deoxyguanosine (dGuo), and the biological end points of apoptosis, intracellular dGTP accumulation, and inhibition of RNA and DNA synthesis were measured. Additionally, adult patients with B-ALL (n = 2) were intravenously infused with 80 mg/m(2)/d daily for 5 days. After therapy, clinical response, toxicity, laboratory biomarkers including PNP enzyme inhibition, and plasma forodesine, dGuo, and intracellular dGTP levels were analyzed. Our in vitro investigations demonstrated that forodesine treatment inhibited proliferation and induced modest apoptosis in de novo B-ALL lymphoblasts. There was time-dependent accumulation of dGTP and inhibition of RNA and DNA synthesis. During therapy, neither patient achieved a complete response (CR), but there was disease stabilization for several weeks in both patients.

Targeting BTK with ibrutinib in relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2013-06-19,"The treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has resulted in few durable remissions. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), an essential component of B-cell-receptor signaling, mediates interactions with the tumor microenvironment and promotes the survival and proliferation of CLL cells. We conducted a phase 1b-2 multicenter study to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ibrutinib (PCI-32765), a first-in-class, oral covalent inhibitor of BTK designed for treatment of B-cell cancers, in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. A total of 85 patients, the majority of whom were considered to have high-risk disease, received ibrutinib orally once daily; 51 received 420 mg, and 34 received 840 mg. Toxic effects were predominantly grade 1 or 2 and included transient diarrhea, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infection; thus, patients could receive extended treatment with minimal hematologic toxic effects. The overall response rate was the same in the group that received 420 mg and the group that received 840 mg (71%), and an additional 20% and 15% of patients in the respective groups had a partial response with lymphocytosis. The response was independent of clinical and genomic risk factors present before treatment, including advanced-stage disease, the number of previous therapies, and the 17p13.1 deletion. At 26 months, the estimated progression-free survival rate was 75% and the rate of overall survival was 83%. Ibrutinib was associated with a high frequency of durable remissions in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL and small lymphocytic lymphoma, including patients with high-risk genetic lesions.

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2013-06-18,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can achieve durable remissions in a number of patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. Little is known about the safety of HSCT in patients age 70 or older. Consecutive patients (n = 54) age 70 or older underwent HSCT between 2007 and 2012. Diseases included acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 25), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 12), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 5), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 4), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 3), myeloproliferative neoplasm (n = 4), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 1). Median follow-up for survivors was 21 months. All patients received reduced-intensity conditioning regimens, primarily busulfan/fludarabine. All patients received unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cell grafts: 44 from 8/8 matched unrelated donors, 8 from matched related donors, and 2 from 7/8 matched unrelated donors. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was calcineurin inhibitor-based in all patients. The median age at transplantation was 71 years (range, 70 to 76); the median HCT comorbidity index score was 1 (range, 0 to 5). Two patients died before hematopoietic recovery (1 with graft failure and 1 with disease progression), and 1 patient relapsed before hematopoietic recovery; otherwise, all engrafted with median donor chimerism of 94% at 1 month. Cumulative incidence of grades II to IV acute GVHD was 13% and of grades III to IV acute GVHD, 9.3%. At 2 years, the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 36%, progression-free survival was 39%, overall survival was 39%, and relapse was 56%.

Lymphoma,2013-07-29,"Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR), the standard of care for the frontline treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), is associated with a high rate of neutropenia and infectious complications. Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) reduces myelosuppression and can potentiate rituximab activity. We conducted a clinical trial combining GM-CSF with FCR for frontline treatment of 60 patients with CLL.

Unrelated donor allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is underused as a curative therapy in eligible patients from the United States.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2013-06-25,"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) is a curative therapy for hematologic disorders including acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic and myeloid leukemia, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and myelodysplastic syndrome. To determine the utilization of alloHCT from unrelated donors (URDs) in the United States, we calculated the number of patients diagnosed with hematologic disorders age 20 to 74 years based on 2004 to 2008 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results and 2007 US Census data, estimated the percentage of patients who would be eligible for URD alloHCT after discounting the mortality rate during induction therapy and the rate of severe comorbidities, and compared these with the actual 2007 alloHCTs facilitated by the National Marrow Donor Program. We found that the number of URD alloHCT as a percentage of the estimated potential transplantations ranged from 11% for multiple myeloma to 54% for chronic myeloid leukemia, with an average percentage of 26% for all the disorders considered. In an analysis stratified by age groups (20 to 44, 45 to 64, and 65 to 74 years), the utilization of URD alloHCT was higher in younger patients than in older patients for all disorders. Of acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia patients, approximately 66% underwent URD alloHCT later in the course of their disease (in second or greater complete remission). URD alloHCT is likely underused for potentially curable hematologic disorders, particularly in older patients. Understanding the reasons for low use of alloHCT may lead to strategies to expand the use of this curative therapy for more patients with hematologic disorders.

CXCR5 polymorphisms in non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk and prognosis.,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",Cancer Immunol. Immunother.,2013-06-28,"CXCR5 [chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 5; also known as Burkitt lymphoma receptor 1 (BCR1)] is expressed on mature B-cells, subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and skin-derived migratory dendritic cells. Together with its ligand, CXCL13, CXCR5 is involved in guiding B-cells into the B-cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs as well as T-cell migration. This study evaluated the role of common germline genetic variation in CXCR5 in the risk and prognosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) using a clinic-based study of 1,521 controls and 2,694 NHL cases including 710 chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, 586 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 588 follicular lymphoma (FL), 137 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), 230 marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), and 158 peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).

Prognostic value of miR-155 in individuals with monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis and patients with B chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2013-07-02,"Noncoding RNAs play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We hypothesized that microRNAs (miRs) are involved in the transition from monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) to CLL and tested miR-15a/16-1 cluster, miR-21, and miR-155 expression in purified B cells of normal individuals, individuals with MBL, and patients with CLL. When we analyzed 224 samples from 2 independent training and validation cohorts, we found that miR-155 was overexpressed in B cells from individuals with MBL, and even more so in B cells from patients with CLL, when compared with B cells from normal individuals. Furthermore, we were able to identify miR-155 in circulating microvesicles from both individuals with MBL and patients with CLL. Next, to examine the prognostic role of miR-155, we measured its expression level in plasma samples collected before treatment initiation in 228 patients with CLL.

Impact of bone marrow stromal cells on Bcl-2 family members in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2013-09-10,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common form of adult leukemia in the Western world. High levels of Bcl-2 family anti-apoptotic proteins are responsible for apoptosis resistance. Besides anti-apoptotic proteins, the microenvironment provides substantial survival signals to CLL leukemic cells. However, in-depth knowledge on the role of individual Bcl-2 family members in the context of the microenvironment is still limited. We performed a comprehensive analysis of transcripts and proteins of 18 Bcl-2 family members using an ""apoptosis array microfluidic card"" in primary cells before and after stromal co-cultures. Our data showed that five of six anti-apoptotic members (excluding Bcl-b), two of three pro-apoptotic members (excluding Bok) and six of nine BH3-only members were present at detectable mRNA levels in CLL cells. Importantly, stromal-mediated extended survival of CLL cells was strongly associated with elevated global transcription. Upon co-culturing with stromal cells, there was an early response of an increase in anti- (2/5) and pro-apoptotic protein (3/8) transcripts on day 1, while an increase in anti-apoptotic proteins was observed on day 3, with no significant change in pro-apoptotic proteins.

Recurrent chromosome abnormalities define nonoverlapping unique subgroups of tumors in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and known karyotypic abnormalities.,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2013-08-01,"A major conclusion drawn from the accumulated cytogenetic data on solid tumors and some hematologic malignancies is that tumors progress by the acquisition of chromosomal changes, as reflected by more aggressive tumors containing a larger number of chromosomal abnormalities. An additional observation is that some chromosomal changes appear early in the disease progression, and some others appear late. On the basis of this information, a model for karyotypic evolution in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is presented. The Mitelman Database of Chromosomes in Cancer was searched, and 1749 abnormal karyotypes were assessed. The main clones were analyzed, and chromosomal gains and losses were used to design a model of genetic acquisition based on the calculation of a variable called time to occurrence (TO). Our comprehensive study of genetic abnormalities in a large number of CLL karyotypes revealed that most CLL has 2 chromosomal aberrations at diagnosis. Moreover, the temporal analysis suggests that trisomy 12 is an early event in the biological evolution of CLL.

Ibrutinib is an irreversible molecular inhibitor of ITK driving a Th1-selective pressure in T lymphocytes.,Blood,Blood,2013-07-25,"Given its critical role in T-cell signaling, interleukin-2-inducible kinase (ITK) is an appealing therapeutic target that can contribute to the pathogenesis of certain infectious, autoimmune, and neoplastic diseases. Ablation of ITK subverts Th2 immunity, thereby potentiating Th1-based immune responses. While small-molecule ITK inhibitors have been identified, none have demonstrated clinical utility. Ibrutinib is a confirmed irreversible inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) with outstanding clinical activity and tolerability in B-cell malignancies. Significant homology between BTK and ITK alongside in silico docking studies support ibrutinib as an immunomodulatory inhibitor of both ITK and BTK. Our comprehensive molecular and phenotypic analysis confirms ITK as an irreversible T-cell target of ibrutinib.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia in young (≤ 55 years) patients: a comprehensive analysis of prognostic factors and outcomes.,Haematologica,Haematologica,2013-08-02,"The clinical characteristics and outcomes of younger (≤ 55 years) patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the era of modern prognostic biomarkers and chemoimmunotherapy are not well understood. Baseline characteristics and outcomes of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia ≤ 55 years who were seen at the Mayo Clinic between January 1995 and April 2012 were compared with those of patients >55 years. The overall survival of patients ≤ 55 years was compared to that of the age- and sex-matched normal population. The characteristics of 844 newly diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients ≤ 55 years old (median, 50 years) were compared to those of 2324 patients >55 years old (median, 67 years). Younger patients were more likely to have Rai stage I or II disease (P<0.0001), be IGHV unmutated (P=0.002) and express ZAP-70 (P=0.009). These differences became more pronounced when the ≤ 55 age group was sub-stratified into age ≤ 45, 46-50 and 51-55 years. After a median follow-up of 5.5 years, 426 (51%) patients ≤ 55 years old had received treatment, and 192 (23%) had died. The time to treatment was shorter in patients ≤ 55 years than in those older than 55 years (4.0 years versus 5.2 years; P=0.001) and those ≤ 55 years had longer survival (12.5 years versus 9.5 years; P<0.0001). However, patients ≤ 55 years had significantly shorter survival than the age- and sex-matched normal population (12.5 years versus not reached; P<0.0001). Our study is the first comprehensive analysis of younger patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the modern era. Adverse prognostic markers appear more common among young patients.

Autologous CLL cell vaccination early after transplant induces leukemia-specific T cells.,The Journal of clinical investigation,J. Clin. Invest.,2013-08-05,"Patients with advanced hematologic malignancies remain at risk for relapse following reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). We conducted a prospective clinical trial to test whether vaccination with whole leukemia cells early after transplantation facilitates the expansion of leukemia-reactive T cells and thereby enhances antitumor immunity. We enrolled 22 patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 18 of whom received up to 6 vaccines initiated between days 30 and 45 after transplantation. Each vaccine consisted of irradiated autologous tumor cells admixed with GM-CSF-secreting bystander cells. Serial patient PBMC samples following transplantation were collected, and the impact of vaccination on T cell activity was evaluated. At a median follow-up of 2.9 (range, 1-4) years, the estimated 2-year progression-free and overall survival rates of vaccinated subjects were 82% (95% CI, 54%-94%) and 88% (95% CI, 59%-97%), respectively. Although vaccination only had a modest impact on recovering T cell numbers, CD8+ T cells from vaccinated patients consistently reacted against autologous tumor, but not alloantigen-bearing recipient cells with increased secretion of the effector cytokine IFN-γ, unlike T cells from nonvaccinated CLL patients undergoing allo-HSCT. Further analysis confirmed that 17% (range, 13%-33%) of CD8+ T cell clones isolated from 4 vaccinated patients by limiting dilution of bulk tumor-reactive T cells solely reacted against CLL-associated antigens. Our studies suggest that autologous tumor cell vaccination is an effective strategy to advance long-term leukemia control following allo-HSCT. Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00442130.

Ibrutinib (PCI-32765) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,Hematol. Oncol. Clin. North Am.,2013-08-01,B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is essential for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cell survival. Many kinases in the BCR signaling pathway are being studied as potential therapeutic targets. Ibrutinib (PCI-32765) is a novel first-in-class selective inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase.

Ofatumumab-based chemoimmunotherapy is effective and well tolerated in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).,Cancer,Cancer,2013-08-06,"Although rituximab-based chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) has substantially improved clinical outcomes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), only 40% to 50% of patients achieve a complete remission (CR). There remains interest in identifying new approaches to improve the effectiveness of CIT. Ofatumumab is a fully human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody with greater apparent single-agent activity than rituximab in CLL patients. Previously untreated CLL patients in need of therapy received 6 cycles of CIT induction with pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and ofatumumab (PCO) followed by response assessment. Of the 48 patients enrolled, 77% completed PCO induction. Adverse events during induction included grade 3+ hematologic toxicity (27%) and grade 3+ nonhematologic toxicity (23%). Median CD4 count after induction and 6 months later were 186 × 10(6)/L and 272 × 10(6) /L. The overall response rate was 96% (46 of 48 patients), and the CR rate was 46% (22 of 48 patients). Among the 38 patients who underwent minimal residual disease evaluation, 7 (18%) were negative for minimal residual disease. After median follow-up of 24 months, 10 (21%) patients have progressed and 8 (17%) have required retreatment. The efficacy and toxicity of ofatumumab-based CIT compare favorably to our historical trials of rituximab-based CIT using an identical chemotherapy backbone (n = 64). Time to retreatment also appeared longer for ofatumumab-based CIT (free of retreatment at 24 months: 86% [95% confidence interval = 75-99] versus 68% [95% confidence interval = 56-81] for rituximab-based CIT). Ofatumumab-based CIT is well tolerated in patients with previously untreated CLL. The efficacy of ofatumumab-based CIT compares favorably to historical trials of rituximab-based CIT, suggesting randomized trials comparing ofatumumab-based CIT and rituximab-based CIT should be considered.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",2359.0,39.0,Although rituximab-based chemoimmunotherapy CIT has substantially improved clinical outcomes in chronic lymphocytic CLL only 40 to 50 of patients achieve a complete remission CR There remains interest in identifying new approaches to improve the effectiveness of CIT Ofatumumab is a fully human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody with greater apparent single-agent activity than rituximab in CLL patients Previously untreated CLL patients in need of therapy received 6 cycles of CIT induction with pentostatin cyclophosphamide and ofatumumab PCO followed by response assessment Of the 48 patients enrolled 77 completed PCO induction Adverse events during induction included grade 3+ hematologic toxicity 27 and grade 3+ nonhematologic toxicity 23 Median CD4 count after induction and 6 months later were 186 10 6 /L and 272 10 6 /L The overall response rate was 96 46 of 48 patients and the CR rate was 46 22 of 48 patients Among the 38 patients who underwent minimal residual disease evaluation 7 18 were negative for minimal residual disease After median follow-up of 24 months 10 21 patients have progressed and 8 17 have required retreatment The efficacy and toxicity of ofatumumab-based CIT compare favorably to our historical trials of rituximab-based CIT using an identical chemotherapy backbone n 64 Time to retreatment also appeared longer for ofatumumab-based CIT free of retreatment at 24 months 86 95 confidence interval 75-99 versus 68 95 confidence interval 56-81 for rituximab-based CIT Ofatumumab-based CIT is well tolerated in patients with previously untreated CLL The efficacy of ofatumumab-based CIT compares favorably to historical trials of rituximab-based CIT suggesting randomized trials comparing ofatumumab-based CIT and rituximab-based CIT should be considered,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[242, 855, 90, 4438, 9192, 71, 2109, 231, 38, 123, 4, 442, 1193, 552, 158, 327, 6, 212, 1, 7, 1359, 8, 236, 734, 684, 125, 469, 1333, 4, 1386, 217, 611, 6, 401, 3, 1236, 1, 9192, 5732, 16, 8, 1910, 171, 312, 2198, 848, 548, 5, 378, 2235, 226, 420, 128, 76, 855, 4, 552, 7, 373, 1278, 552, 7, 4, 594, 1, 36, 103, 49, 410, 1, 9192, 504, 5, 7596, 1112, 2, 5732, 16118, 370, 20, 51, 455, 1, 3, 576, 7, 346, 849, 781, 16118, 504, 290, 281, 190, 504, 159, 88, 27, 813, 155, 428, 2, 88, 27, 3534, 155, 382, 52, 1440, 1276, 50, 504, 2, 49, 53, 1559, 11, 5869, 79, 49, 805, 2, 6905, 79, 49, 805, 3, 63, 51, 116, 10, 921, 641, 1, 576, 7, 2, 3, 684, 116, 10, 641, 350, 1, 576, 7, 107, 3, 519, 7, 54, 208, 1048, 753, 34, 451, 67, 203, 11, 199, 9, 1048, 753, 34, 50, 52, 166, 126, 1, 259, 53, 79, 239, 7, 47, 1839, 2, 66, 269, 47, 616, 6291, 3, 209, 2, 155, 1, 5732, 90, 9192, 932, 5001, 6, 114, 2252, 143, 1, 855, 90, 9192, 75, 35, 3038, 56, 7066, 78, 660, 98, 6, 6291, 120, 2121, 589, 9, 5732, 90, 9192, 115, 1, 6291, 28, 259, 53, 868, 48, 307, 268, 481, 1058, 185, 806, 48, 307, 268, 664, 865, 9, 855, 90, 9192, 5732, 90, 9192, 16, 149, 421, 4, 7, 5, 373, 1278, 552, 3, 209, 1, 5732, 90, 9192, 5815, 5001, 6, 2252, 143, 1, 855, 90, 9192, 802, 384, 143, 1430, 5732, 90, 9192, 2, 855, 90, 9192, 257, 40, 515]",1782.0,23922059,103
"Myelosuppression after frontline fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia: analysis of persistent and new-onset cytopenia.",Cancer,Cancer,2013-08-13,"The combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) has produced improved response rates and a prolonged survival in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, its therapeutic power is counterbalanced by significant hematologic toxicity. Persistent and new-onset cytopenia after the completion of FCR raise concern about disease recurrence, the development of therapy-related myeloid malignancies (TRMM), and infections. A total of 207 patients with CLL who achieved complete response, complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery, or nodular partial remission were analyzed after frontline FCR therapy. Three months after the completion of therapy, 35% of patients had developed grade 2 to 4 cytopenia (according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 4.0]). Factors found to be associated with cytopenia at 3 months after therapy were older age, advanced Rai stage disease, and lower baseline blood counts. Moreover, patients with cytopenia were less likely to have completed 6 courses of therapy with FCR. At 6 months and 9 months after therapy, the prevalence of grade 2 to 4 cytopenia was 24% and 12%, respectively. No differences in progression-free survival and overall survival were noted between cytopenic and noncytopenic patients or between patients with persistent and new-onset cytopenia. The prevalence of TRMM was 2.3% and did not differ significantly between cytopenic and noncytopenic patients or between those with persistent and new-onset disease. Late infections were more common in patients who were cytopenic at 9 months (38%) and were mostly bacterial (67%). Cytopenia after the completion of therapy is a common complication of frontline FCR that improves over time, particularly for new-onset cases. The presence of persistent cytopenia (lasting up to 9 months after the completion of therapy) should not raise concern about CLL recurrence of the development of TRMM, but should encourage surveillance for bacterial infections for an additional 9 months.",Journal Article,2352.0,36.0,The combination of fludarabine cyclophosphamide and rituximab FCR has produced improved response rates and a prolonged survival in patients with chronic lymphocytic CLL However its therapeutic power is counterbalanced by significant hematologic toxicity Persistent and new-onset cytopenia after the completion of FCR raise concern about disease recurrence the development of therapy-related myeloid malignancies TRMM and infections A total of 207 patients with CLL who achieved complete response complete response with incomplete marrow recovery or nodular partial remission were analyzed after frontline FCR therapy Three months after the completion of therapy 35 of patients had developed grade 2 to 4 cytopenia according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 Factors found to be associated with cytopenia at 3 months after therapy were older age advanced Rai stage disease and lower baseline blood counts Moreover patients with cytopenia were less likely to have completed 6 courses of therapy with FCR At 6 months and 9 months after therapy the prevalence of grade 2 to 4 cytopenia was 24 and 12 respectively No differences in progression-free survival and overall survival were noted between cytopenic and noncytopenic patients or between patients with persistent and new-onset cytopenia The prevalence of TRMM was 2.3 and did not differ significantly between cytopenic and noncytopenic patients or between those with persistent and new-onset disease Late infections were more common in patients who were cytopenic at 9 months 38 and were mostly bacterial 67 Cytopenia after the completion of therapy is a common complication of frontline FCR that improves over time particularly for new-onset cases The presence of persistent cytopenia lasting up to 9 months after the completion of therapy should not raise concern about CLL recurrence of the development of TRMM but should encourage surveillance for bacterial infections for an additional 9 months,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 150, 1, 2027, 1112, 2, 855, 4953, 71, 1687, 231, 51, 151, 2, 8, 1069, 25, 4, 7, 5, 442, 1193, 552, 137, 211, 189, 2349, 16, 22111, 20, 93, 813, 155, 1882, 2, 217, 1707, 8165, 50, 3, 1438, 1, 4953, 5008, 2893, 545, 34, 146, 3, 193, 1, 36, 139, 533, 441, 40447, 2, 1875, 8, 181, 1, 5292, 7, 5, 552, 54, 513, 236, 51, 236, 51, 5, 2610, 581, 1602, 15, 4481, 450, 734, 11, 311, 50, 3171, 4953, 36, 169, 53, 50, 3, 1438, 1, 36, 465, 1, 7, 42, 276, 88, 18, 6, 39, 8165, 768, 6, 186, 3462, 371, 9, 290, 281, 2256, 39, 13, 130, 204, 6, 40, 41, 5, 8165, 28, 27, 53, 50, 36, 11, 434, 89, 131, 4121, 82, 34, 2, 280, 330, 315, 1911, 1393, 7, 5, 8165, 11, 299, 322, 6, 47, 781, 49, 1993, 1, 36, 5, 4953, 28, 49, 53, 2, 83, 53, 50, 36, 3, 1078, 1, 88, 18, 6, 39, 8165, 10, 259, 2, 133, 106, 77, 362, 4, 91, 115, 25, 2, 63, 25, 11, 1051, 59, 32164, 2, 47890, 7, 15, 59, 7, 5, 1882, 2, 217, 1707, 8165, 3, 1078, 1, 40447, 10, 18, 27, 2, 205, 44, 1505, 97, 59, 32164, 2, 47890, 7, 15, 59, 135, 5, 1882, 2, 217, 1707, 34, 807, 1875, 11, 80, 186, 4, 7, 54, 11, 32164, 28, 83, 53, 519, 2, 11, 2754, 5117, 598, 8165, 50, 3, 1438, 1, 36, 16, 8, 186, 1447, 1, 3171, 4953, 17, 1804, 252, 98, 823, 9, 217, 1707, 140, 3, 463, 1, 1882, 8165, 3443, 126, 6, 83, 53, 50, 3, 1438, 1, 36, 257, 44, 5008, 2893, 545, 552, 146, 1, 3, 193, 1, 40447, 84, 257, 7113, 617, 9, 5117, 1875, 9, 35, 402, 83, 53]",1979.0,23943357,514
Increasing the complexity of chromatin: functionally distinct roles for replication-dependent histone H2A isoforms in cell proliferation and carcinogenesis.,Nucleic acids research,Nucleic Acids Res.,2013-08-16,"Replication-dependent histones are encoded by multigene families found in several large clusters in the human genome and are thought to be functionally redundant. However, the abundance of specific replication-dependent isoforms of histone H2A is altered in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Similar changes in the abundance of H2A isoforms are also associated with the proliferation and tumorigenicity of bladder cancer cells. To determine whether these H2A isoforms can perform distinct functions, expression of several H2A isoforms was reduced by siRNA knockdown. Reduced expression of the HIST1H2AC locus leads to increased rates of cell proliferation and tumorigenicity. We also observe that regulation of replication-dependent histone H2A expression can occur on a gene-specific level. Specific replication-dependent histone H2A genes are either up- or downregulated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia tumor tissue samples. In addition, discreet elements are identified in the 5' untranslated region of the HIST1H2AC locus that confer translational repression. Taken together, these results indicate that replication-dependent histone isoforms can possess distinct cellular functions and that regulation of these isoforms may play a role in carcinogenesis.

Skin cancer surveillance and malignancies of the skin in a community-dwelling cohort of patients with newly diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Journal of oncology practice,J Oncol Pract,2013-08-27,"Assess compliance with skin cancer screening guidelines in a community-dwelling cohort of patients with newly diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and evaluate the clinical utility of such screening. We identified patients diagnosed at Mayo Clinic with CLL between January 1, 2004, and June 1, 2012, who resided within 30 miles of Mayo Clinic. We evaluated adherence to skin cancer screening and identified the prevalence of skin malignancies during follow-up. Medical records were reviewed to document skin cancer screening and diagnosis of a skin malignancy. Collectively, 113 individuals who met criteria were diagnosed with CLL during the study interval. Forty-one patients (36%) had a whole body skin examination by either a dermatologist or primary care provider documented within 6 months of diagnosis; of these; nine (8% of overall cohort; 22% of examined patients) had a skin malignancy identified. Fifteen additional skin malignancies were diagnosed during follow-up.

Lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1 is a chronic lymphocytic leukemia membrane-associated antigen critical to niche homing.,Blood,Blood,2013-09-05,"Membrane antigens are critical to the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as they facilitate microenvironment homing, proliferation, and survival. Targeting the CLL membrane and associated signaling patterns is a current focus of therapeutic development. Many tumor membrane targets are simultaneously targeted by humoral immunity, thus forming recognizable immunoglobulin responses. We sought to use this immune response to identify novel membrane-associated targets for CLL. Using a novel strategy, we interrogated CLL membrane-specific autologous immunoglobulin G reactivity. Our analysis unveiled lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1 (LCP1), a lymphocyte-specific target that is highly expressed in CLL. LCP1 plays a critical role in B-cell biology by crosslinking F-actin filaments, thereby solidifying cytoskeletal structures and providing a scaffold for critical signaling pathways. Small interfering RNA knockdown of LCP1 blocked migration toward CXCL12 in transwell assays and to bone marrow in an in vivo xenotransplant model, confirming a role for LCP1 in leukemia migration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib or the PI3K inhibitor idelalisib block B-cell receptor induced activation of LCP1. Our data demonstrate a novel strategy to identify cancer membrane target antigens using humoral anti-tumor immunity. In addition, we identify LCP1 as a membrane-associated target in CLL with confirmed pathogenic significance.

Isolation and analysis of linker histones across cellular compartments.,Journal of proteomics,J Proteomics,2013-09-05,"Analysis of histones, especially histone H1, is severely limited by immunological reagent availability. This paper describes the application of cellular fractionation with LC-MS for profiling histones in the cytosol and upon chromatin. First, we show that linker histones enriched by cellular fractionation gives less nuclear contamination and higher histone content than when prepared by nuclei isolation. Second, we profiled the soluble linker histones throughout the cell cycle revealing phosphorylation increases as cells reach mitosis. Finally, we monitored histone H1.2-H1.5 translocation to the cytosol in response to the CDK inhibitor flavopiridol in primary CLL cells treated ex vivo. Data shows that all H1 variants translocate in response to drug treatment with no specific order to their cytosolic appearance. The results illustrate the utility of cellular fractionation in conjunction with LC-MS for the analysis of histone H1 throughout the cell. This paper demonstrates the first time application of cellular fractionation to characterize cytosolic histone H1 by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Using the Ramos Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, cellular fractionation was shown to give less nuclear contamination and higher histone content than preparations by nuclei isolation. Further application of the cellular fractionation approach was shown by using primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells to monitor the movement of histone H1 across cellular compartments in response to the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol.

"Clinical characteristics, response to therapy, and survival of African American patients diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia: joint experience of the MD Anderson Cancer Center and Duke University Medical Center.",Cancer,Cancer,2013-07-08,"Little is known regarding racial disparities in characteristics and outcomes among patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The characteristics and outcomes of untreated African American (AA) patients with CLL (n = 84) were analyzed and compared with a reference nonblack (NB) patient population (n = 1571). At the time of presentation, AA patients had lower median hemoglobin levels (12.9 g/dL vs 13.7 g/dL), higher β2 microglobulin levels (2.7 mg/dL vs 2.4 mg/dL), greater frequency of constitutional symptoms (27% vs 10%), unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IGHV) mutation status (65% vs 47%), ζ-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70) expression (58% vs 32%), and deletion of chromosome 17p or chromosome 11q (28% vs 17%; P ≤ 02 for each comparison). Fifty-one percent of AA patients and 39% of NB patients required first-line therapy and 91% and 88%, respectively, received chemoimmunotherapy. Overall response rates to treatment were 85% for AA patients and 94% for NB patients (P = .06); and the complete response rates were 56% and 58%, respectively (P = .87).

Characterization of a new chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell line for mechanistic in vitro and in vivo studies relevant to disease.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2013-10-09,"Studies of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have yielded substantial progress, however a lack of immortalized cell lines representative of the primary disease has hampered a full understanding of disease pathogenesis and development of new treatments. Here we describe a novel CLL cell line (OSU-CLL) generated by EBV transformation, which displays a similar cytogenetic and immunophenotype observed in the patient's CLL (CD5 positive with trisomy 12 and 19). A companion cell line was also generated from the same patient (OSU-NB). This cell line lacked typical CLL characteristics, and is likely derived from the patient's normal B cells. In vitro migration assays demonstrated that OSU-CLL exhibits migratory properties similar to primary CLL cells whereas OSU-NB has significantly reduced ability to migrate spontaneously or towards chemokine. Microarray analysis demonstrated distinct gene expression patterns in the two cell lines, including genes on chromosomes 12 and 19, which is consistent with the cytogenetic profile in this cell line. Finally, OSU-CLL was readily transplantable into NOG mice, producing uniform engraftment by three weeks with leukemic cells detectable in the peripheral blood spleen and bone marrow. These studies describe a new CLL cell line that extends currently available models to study gene function in this disease.

"The Spiegelmer NOX-A12, a novel CXCL12 inhibitor, interferes with chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell motility and causes chemosensitization.",Blood,Blood,2013-11-25,"The CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL12, or stromal cell-derived factor-1 as previously known) plays a critical role for homing and retention of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells in tissues such as the bone marrow (BM). In tissues, stromal cells constitutively secrete and present CXCL12 via cell-surface-bound glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), thereby attracting CLL cells and protecting them from cytotoxic drugs, a mechanism that may account for residual disease after conventional CLL therapy. NOX-A12, an RNA oligonucleotide in L-configuration (Spiegelmer) that binds and neutralizes CXCL12, was developed for interference with CXCL12 in the tumor microenvironment and for cell mobilization. Here, we examined effects of NOX-A12 on CLL cell migration and drug sensitivity. We found that NOX-A12 effectively inhibited CXCL12-induced chemotaxis of CLL cells. In contrast, NOX-A12 increased CLL migration underneath a confluent layer of BM stromal cells (BMSCs) due to interference with the CXCL12 gradient established by BMSCs. In particular, NOX-A12 competes with GAGs such as heparin for CXCL12 binding, leading to the release of CXCL12 from stromal cell-surface-bound GAGs, and thereby to neutralization of the chemokine. Furthermore, NOX-A12 sensitizes CLL cells toward bendamustine and fludarabine in BMSC cocultures. These data demonstrate that NOX-A12 effectively interferes with CLL cell migration and BMSC-mediated drug resistance, and establishes a rationale for clinical development of NOX-A12 in combination with conventional agents in CLL.

Use of positron emission tomography-computed tomography in the management of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2014-02-17,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) cells typically have low 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-d-glucose (FDG) avidity, and patients with CLL have an increased risk of developing FDG-avid aggressive lymphomas, second malignancies and infections. We hypothesized that FDG positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) of the trunk is a sensitive method of detecting these complications in patients with CLL. Of the of 2299 patients with CLL seen in the Division of Hematology at Mayo Clinic Rochester between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2011, 272 (11.8%) had 526 PET-CT scans and 472 (89.7%) of these were reported as abnormal. Among the 293 (55.7%) PET-CT scans used for routine evaluation of CLL, the PET component was of clinical value in only one instance. In contrast, in 83 (30.5%) patients, PET-CT scans used to evaluate new clinical complications localized high FDG-avidity lesions for biopsies. This resulted in clinically relevant new diagnoses in 32 patients, including those with more aggressive lymphoma (n = 16), non-hematological malignancies (n = 8) and opportunistic infections (n = 3).

Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) function is important to the development and expansion of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).,Blood,Blood,2013-12-05,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by constitutive activation of the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway, but variable responsiveness of the BCR to antigen ligation. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) shows constitutive activity in CLL and is the target of irreversible inhibition by ibrutinib, an orally bioavailable kinase inhibitor that has shown outstanding activity in CLL. Early clinical results in CLL with other reversible and irreversible BTK inhibitors have been less promising, however, raising the question of whether BTK kinase activity is an important target of ibrutinib and also in CLL. To determine the role of BTK in CLL, we used patient samples and the Eμ-TCL1 (TCL1) transgenic mouse model of CLL, which results in spontaneous leukemia development. Inhibition of BTK in primary human CLL cells by small interfering RNA promotes apoptosis. Inhibition of BTK kinase activity through either targeted genetic inactivation or ibrutinib in the TCL1 mouse significantly delays the development of CLL, demonstrating that BTK is a critical kinase for CLL development and expansion and thus an important target of ibrutinib.

Patients received 28 day cycles of once-daily ibrutinib 420 mg or ibrutinib 840 mg. The 840 mg dose was discontinued after enrolment had begun because comparable activity of the doses has been shown. The primary endpoint was the safety of the dose-fixed regimen in terms of frequency and severity of adverse events for all patients who received treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01105247. Between May 20, 2010, and Dec 18, 2012, we enrolled 29 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and two patients with small lymphocytic lymphoma. Median age was 71 years (range 65-84), and 23 (74%) patients were at least 70 years old. Toxicity was mainly of mild-to-moderate severity (grade 1-2). 21 (68%) patients had diarrhoea (grade 1 in 14 [45%] patients, grade 2 in three [10%] patients, and grade 3 in four [13%] patients). 15 (48%) patients developed nausea (grade 1 in 12 [39%] patients and grade 2 in three [10%] patients). Ten (32%) patients developed fatigue (grade 1 in five [16%] patients, grade 2 in four [13%] patients, and grade 3 in one [3%] patient). Three (10%) patients developed grade 3 infections, although no grade 4 or 5 infections occurred. One patient developed grade 3 neutropenia, and one developed grade 4 thrombocytopenia. After a median follow-up of 22.1 months (IQR 18.4-23.2), 22 (71%) of 31 patients achieved an objective response (95% CI 52.0-85.8); four patients (13%) had a complete response, one patient (3%) had a nodular partial response, and 17 (55%) patients had a partial response. The safety and activity of ibrutinib in elderly, previously untreated patients with symptomatic chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, or small lymphocytic lymphoma is encouraging, and merits further investigation in phase 3 trials.

In primary patient cells, the median IC50 was approximately 10 nmol/L, and cell death occurred within 2 hours. Our ex vivo sensitivity results compare favorably with those observed for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a disease for which ABT-199 has demonstrated consistent activity in clinical trials. Moreover, mitochondrial studies using BH3 profiling demonstrate activity at the mitochondrion that correlates well with cytotoxicity, supporting an on-target mitochondrial mechanism of action.

How will B-cell-receptor-targeted therapies change future CLL therapy?,Blood,Blood,2014-01-06,"For many years there has been considerable disassociation between the understood biology of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and the therapeutics used to treat this disease. With the introduction of the first targeted CD20 antibody rituximab and its addition to chemotherapy came the first observation that minimal residual disease-negative (MRD-negative) complete responses (CRs) could be obtained with dramatically improved progression-free survival and overall survival. This advance was soon to be surpassed by the introduction of therapeutics that target B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling.

Prolonged lymphocytosis during ibrutinib therapy is associated with distinct molecular characteristics and does not indicate a suboptimal response to therapy.,Blood,Blood,2014-01-10,"The Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib has outstanding activity in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Most patients experience lymphocytosis, representing lymphocyte egress from nodal compartments. This resolves within 8 months in the majority of patients, but a subgroup has lymphocytosis lasting >12 months. Here we report a detailed characterization of patients with persistent lymphocytosis during ibrutinib therapy. Signaling evaluation showed that while BTK is inhibited, downstream mediators of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling are activated in persistent lymphocytes. These cells cannot be stimulated through the BCR and do not show evidence of target gene activation. Flow cytometry for κ and λ expression, IGHV sequencing, Zap-70 methylation, and targeted gene sequencing in these patients are identical at baseline and later time points, suggesting that persistent lymphocytes do not represent clonal evolution. In vitro treatment with targeted kinase inhibitors shows that they are not addicted to a single survival pathway. Finally, progression-free survival is not inferior for patients with prolonged lymphocytosis vs those with traditional responses. Thus, prolonged lymphocytosis is common following ibrutinib treatment, likely represents the persistence of a quiescent clone, and does not predict a subgroup of patients likely to relapse early.

How we treat Richter syndrome.,Blood,Blood,2014-01-13,"Richter syndrome (RS) is defined as the transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) into an aggressive lymphoma, most commonly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). RS occurs in approximately 2% to 10% of CLL patients during the course of their disease, with a transformation rate of 0.5% to 1% per year. A combination of germline genetic characteristics, clinical features (eg, advanced Rai stage), biologic (ζ-associated protein-70(+), CD38(+), CD49d(+)) and somatic genetic (del17p13.1 or del11q23.1) characteristics of CLL B cells, and certain CLL therapies are associated with higher risk of RS. Recent studies have also identified the crucial role of CDKN2A loss, TP53 disruption, C-MYC activation, and NOTCH1 mutations in the transformation from CLL to RS. An excisional lymph node biopsy is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of RS; a (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan can help inform the optimal site for biopsy. Approximately 80% of DLBCL cases in patients with CLL are clonally related to the underlying CLL, and the median survival for these patients is approximately 1 year. In contrast, the remaining 20% of patients have a clonally unrelated DLBCL and have a prognosis similar to that of de novo DLBCL. For patients with clonally related DLBCL, induction therapy with either an anthracycline- or platinum-based regimen is the standard approach. Postremission stem cell transplantation should be considered for appropriate patients. This article summarizes our approach to the clinical management of CLL patients who develop RS.

"Induced resistance to ofatumumab-mediated cell clearance mechanisms, including complement-dependent cytotoxicity, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",J. Immunol.,2014-01-15,"Ofatumumab (OFA), a human CD20-targeting mAb, kills B lymphocytes using the innate immune system including complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). The efficacy of OFA in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is limited by drug resistance, which is not well characterized. To better understand mechanisms of resistance, we prospectively studied CLL cells isolated from blood samples collected before and after in vivo exposure to the initial dose of OFA therapy in 25 patients undergoing their first treatment for progressive CLL. As previously reported, OFA therapy rapidly decreased the absolute lymphocyte count, CD20 expression by CLL cells, and serum complement levels. We now show that after administration of the first dose of OFA, there was a modest rebound in the absolute lymphocyte count and serum complement levels, but substantial ongoing loss of CD20 expression by CLL cells. These post-OFA treatment CLL cells were highly resistant to OFA-mediated CDC but retained sensitivity to alemtuzumab-mediated CDC in vitro. Posttherapy serum OFA levels correlated inversely with both the amount of pretreatment circulating cell-bound CD20 and with the decrease in this value following treatment. In vitro OFA-mediated CDC did not predict clinical responses, and the patients with first-dose reactions to OFA did not have markers of increased complement activation in vivo. We propose that optimal efficacy of CD20- targeted therapy for CLL requires determining an mAb dose size and frequency that optimizes CLL killing without exceeding the capacity of the cytotoxic mechanisms and thus minimizes loss of CD20 expression in the surviving CLL cells.

"Population pharmacokinetics of ofatumumab in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular lymphoma, and rheumatoid arthritis.",Journal of clinical pharmacology,J Clin Pharmacol,2014-01-28,"Ofatumumab is a human monoclonal antibody directed at CD20 approved for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The population pharmacokinetics of intravenous ofatumumab were characterized in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia, relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, and rheumatoid arthritis, diseases with widely varying CD20⁺ B-cell counts in blood. Serum concentration data from a total of 477 patients who received ofatumumab doses ranging from 100 mg to 2000 mg in different dosing regimens were analyzed to determine the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ofatumumab across different patient groups and to identify factors contributing to the pharmacokinetic variability.

Multidimensional single-cell analysis of BCR signaling reveals proximal activation defect as a hallmark of chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2014-01-29,"Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is defined by a perturbed B-cell receptor-mediated signaling machinery. We aimed to model differential signaling behavior between B cells from CLL and healthy individuals to pinpoint modes of dysregulation. We developed an experimental methodology combining immunophenotyping, multiplexed phosphospecific flow cytometry, and multifactorial statistical modeling. Utilizing patterns of signaling network covariance, we modeled BCR signaling in 67 CLL patients using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). Results from multidimensional modeling were validated using an independent test cohort of 38 patients. We identified a dynamic and variable imbalance between proximal (pSYK, pBTK) and distal (pPLCγ2, pBLNK, ppERK) phosphoresponses. PLSR identified the relationship between upstream tyrosine kinase SYK and its target, PLCγ2, as maximally predictive and sufficient to distinguish CLL from healthy samples, pointing to this juncture in the signaling pathway as a hallmark of CLL B cells. Specific BCR pathway signaling signatures that correlate with the disease and its degree of aggressiveness were identified. Heterogeneity in the PLSR response variable within the B cell population is both a characteristic mark of healthy samples and predictive of disease aggressiveness. Single-cell multidimensional analysis of BCR signaling permitted focused analysis of the variability and heterogeneity of signaling behavior from patient-to-patient, and from cell-to-cell.

CD49d is the strongest flow cytometry-based predictor of overall survival in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2014-02-10,"Although CD49d is an unfavorable prognostic marker in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), definitive validation evidence is lacking. A worldwide multicenter analysis was performed using published and unpublished CLL series to evaluate the impact of CD49d as an overall (OS) and treatment-free survival (TFS) predictor. A training/validation strategy was chosen to find the optimal CD49d cutoff. The hazard ratio (HR) for death and treatment imposed by CD49d was estimated by pooled analysis of 2,972 CLLs; Cox analysis stratified by center and stage was used to adjust for confounding variables. The importance of CD49d over other flow cytometry-based prognosticators (eg, CD38, ZAP-70) was ranked by recursive partitioning. Patients with ≥ 30% of neoplastic cells expressing CD49d were considered CD49d+. Decrease in OS at 5 and 10 years among CD49d+ patients was 7% and 23% (decrease in TFS, 26% and 25%, respectively). Pooled HR of CD49d for OS was 2.5 (2.3 for TFS) in univariate analysis. This HR remained significant and of similar magnitude (HR, 2.0) in a Cox model adjusted for clinical and biologic prognosticators. Hierarchic trees including all patients or restricted to those with early-stage disease or those age ≤ 65 years always selected CD49d as the most important flow cytometry-based biomarker, with negligible additional prognostic information added by CD38 or ZAP-70. Consistently, by bivariate analysis, CD49d reliably identified patient subsets with poorer outcome independent of CD38 and ZAP-70.

"Ocaratuzumab, an Fc-engineered antibody demonstrates enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",mAbs,MAbs,2014-03-04,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is common in both developed and developing nations where the need for inexpensive and convenient administration of therapy is apparent. Ocaratuzumab is a novel Fc-engineered humanized IgG1 anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) designed for effective antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) at very low concentrations that may facilitate sub-cutaneous (vs. intravenous) dosing. Here, we report ocaratuzumab's potency against CLL cells. In vitro assessment of ocaratuzumab's direct cytotoxicity (DC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and ADCC was performed on CLL cells. Ocaratuzumab induced DC, CDC, and ADCP similarly to rituximab or ofatumumab (anti-CD20 mAbs). However, ocaratuzumab showed an advantage in NK cell-mediated ADCC over these antibodies. In allogeneic ADCC, [E:T (effector:target) ratios = 25:1, 12:1, 6:1], ocaratuzumab (10 µg/mL) improved ADCC by ~3-fold compared with rituximab or ofatumumab (P<0.001 all tested E:T ratios). Notably, the superiority of ocaratuzumab-induced ADCC was observed at low concentrations (0.1-10 ug/ml; P<0.03; allogeneic assays). In extended allogeneic ADCC E:T titration, ocaratuzumab (0.1 µg/mL) demonstrated 19.4% more cytotoxicity than rituximab (E:T = 0.38:1; P = 0.0066) and 21.5% more cytotoxicity than ofatumumab (E:T = 1.5:1; P = 0.0015). In autologous ADCC, ocaratuzumab (10 µg/mL) demonstrated ~1.5-fold increase in cytotoxicity compared with rituximab or ofatumumab at all E:T ratios tested (E:Ts = 25:1,12:1,6:1; all P<0.001). Obinutuzumab, a glyco-engineered anti-CD20 mAb, showed no improvement in ADCC activity compared with ocaratuzumab. The enhanced ADCC of ocaratuzumab suggests that it may be effective at low concentrations. If supported by clinical investigation, this feature could potentially allow for subcutaneous dosing at low doses that could expand the potential of administering chemoimmunotherapy in developing countries.

Acquired anomalies in other regions account for 70% of the total detected anomalies, and their number per participant has a significant effect on progression-free survival after adjusting for the effects of 17p- (and other covariates). These results were compared with those from a previous study of more than 50,000 participants from the GENEVA consortium of genome-wide association studies, which analyzed individuals with a variety of medical conditions and healthy controls. The percentage of individuals with acquired anomalies is vastly different between the two studies (GENEVA 0.8%; E2997 80%). The composition of the anomalies also differs, with GENEVA having a higher percentage of acquired uniparental disomies and a lower percentage of deletions. The four common CLL anomalies are among the most frequent in GENEVA participants, some of whom may have CLL-precursor conditions or early stages of CLL.

Patients were treated at 6 dose levels of oral idelalisib (range 50-350 mg once or twice daily) and remained on continuous therapy while deriving clinical benefit. Idelalisib-mediated inhibition of PI3Kδ led to abrogation of Akt phosphorylation in patient CLL cells and significantly reduced serum levels of CLL-related chemokines. The most commonly observed grade ≥3 adverse events were pneumonia (20%), neutropenic fever (11%), and diarrhea (6%). Idelalisib treatment resulted in nodal responses in 81% of patients. The overall response rate was 72%, with 39% of patients meeting the criteria for partial response per IWCLL 2008 and 33% meeting the recently updated criteria of PR with treatment-induced lymphocytosis.(1,2) The median progression-free survival for all patients was 15.8 months. This study demonstrates the clinical utility of inhibiting the PI3Kδ pathway with idelalisib. Our findings support the further development of idelalisib in patients with CLL.

We aimed to correlate 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoroglucose/positron emission tomography (FDG/PET) data, histological diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and survival in patients with CLL. A total of 332 patients with CLL were histologically classified as: 95 RS, 117 HAC, and 120 histologically indolent CLL (HIC). HAC and RS patients had higher maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), more frequent constitutional symptoms, poorer performance status (PS), lower hemoglobin and platelets, and higher lactate dehydrogenase and β-2-microglobulin. An SUVmax ≥10 strongly correlated with mortality (overall survival [OS], 56.7 vs 6.9 months in patients with SUVmax <10 vs ≥10). Survival of patients with RS and HAC was similar among patients with SUVmax <10 or ≥10. SUVmax ≥10, PS ≥2, bulky disease, and age ≥65 were independently associated with shorter OS. In patients undergoing both fine-needle aspiration and biopsy, the former proved diagnostically inadequate in 23%, 29%, and 53% of HIC, HAC, and RS, respectively.

Incidence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and high-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis using the 2008 guidelines.,Cancer,Cancer,2014-04-07,"The 1996 National Cancer Institute Working Group (NCI-WG 96) guidelines classified disease in individuals who had a B-cell clone with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) immunophenotype as CLL if their absolute lymphocyte count was ≥5 × 10(9)/L. The 2008 International Workshop on CLL guidelines (IWCLL 2008) classified disease as CLL if the absolute B-cell count was ≥5 × 10(9)/L or as monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) if the absolute B-cell count was <5 × 10(9)/L. The objective of the current study of Olmsted County, Minnesota, was to assess the effects of these changes on incidence rates and presentation from 2000 to 2010. Using diagnostic indices available through the Rochester Epidemiology Project and the Mayo CLL database, the authors identified all patients with newly diagnosed CLL and high-count MBL from 2000 to 2010. Age-specific and sex-specific incidence rates were determined. According to NCI-WG 96 criteria, there were 115 patients with CLL and 8 patients with MBL during the period studied. Using the IWCLL 2008 classification, there were 79 patients with CLL and 40 patients with MBL. Rai stage distribution (low risk, intermediate risk, and high risk) using NCI-WG 96 criteria was 60.9%, 33.9%, and 5.2%, respectively, compared with 43%, 49.4%, and 7.6%, respectively, using IWCLL 2008 criteria.

Alemtuzumab-containing chemoimmunotherapy regimens can be effective but frequently cause serious infections. We report a Phase II trial testing the efficacy and tolerability of a short-duration regimen combining pentostatin, alemtuzumab, and low-dose high-frequency rituximab designed to decrease the risk of treatment-associated infections and to limit the loss of CD20 expression by CLL cells. The study enrolled 39 patients with progressive CLL that was either relapsed/refractory (n = 36) or previously untreated with 17p13 deletion (17p13-) (n = 3). Thirteen (33%) patients had both 17p13- and TP53 mutations predicted to be dysfunctional, and eight patients had purine analog refractory CLL without TP53 dysfunction. Twenty-six (67%) patients completed therapy, with only five (13%) patients having treatment-limiting toxicity and no treatment-related deaths. Twenty-two (56%) patients responded to treatment, with 11 (28%) complete responses (four with incomplete bone marrow recovery). Median progression-free survival was 7.2 months, time to next treatment was 9.1 months, and overall survival was 34.1 months. The majority of deaths (82%) were caused by progressive disease, including transformed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 6). Correlative studies showed that low-dose rituximab activates complement and natural killer cells without a profound and sustained decrease in expression of CD20 by circulating CLL cells. We conclude that pentostatin, alemtuzumab, and low-dose high-frequency rituximab is a tolerable and effective therapy for CLL and that low-dose rituximab therapy can activate innate immune cytotoxic mechanisms without substantially decreasing CD20 expression.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",2096.0,25.0,Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic CLL patients with purine analog refractory disease or TP53 dysfunction still have limited treatment options and poor survival Alemtuzumab-containing chemoimmunotherapy regimens can be effective but frequently cause serious infections We report a Phase II trial testing the efficacy and tolerability of a short-duration regimen combining pentostatin alemtuzumab and low-dose high-frequency rituximab designed to decrease the risk of treatment-associated infections and to limit the loss of CD20 expression by CLL cells The study enrolled 39 patients with progressive CLL that was either relapsed/refractory n 36 or previously untreated with 17p13 deletion 17p13- n 3 Thirteen 33 patients had both 17p13- and TP53 mutations predicted to be dysfunctional and eight patients had purine analog refractory CLL without TP53 dysfunction Twenty-six 67 patients completed therapy with only five 13 patients having treatment-limiting toxicity and no treatment-related deaths Twenty-two 56 patients responded to treatment with 11 28 complete responses four with incomplete marrow recovery Median progression-free survival was 7.2 months time to next treatment was 9.1 months and overall survival was 34.1 months The majority of deaths 82 were caused by progressive disease including transformed diffuse large B-cell n 6 Correlative studies showed that low-dose rituximab activates complement and natural killer cells without a profound and sustained decrease in expression of CD20 by circulating CLL cells We conclude that pentostatin alemtuzumab and low-dose high-frequency rituximab is a tolerable and effective therapy for CLL and that low-dose rituximab therapy can activate innate immune cytotoxic mechanisms without substantially decreasing CD20 expression,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[442, 1193, 2647, 302, 1193, 552, 7, 5, 5006, 3497, 430, 34, 15, 1206, 1527, 1234, 47, 383, 24, 838, 2, 334, 25, 3579, 1101, 4438, 472, 122, 40, 323, 84, 746, 708, 1762, 1875, 21, 414, 8, 124, 215, 160, 471, 3, 209, 2, 1543, 1, 8, 978, 654, 477, 1525, 7596, 3579, 2, 154, 61, 64, 675, 855, 1114, 6, 775, 3, 43, 1, 24, 41, 1875, 2, 6, 2385, 3, 407, 1, 2198, 55, 20, 552, 37, 3, 45, 346, 587, 7, 5, 1014, 552, 17, 10, 361, 591, 430, 78, 511, 15, 373, 1278, 5, 7526, 1528, 7526, 78, 27, 3170, 466, 7, 42, 110, 7526, 2, 1206, 138, 783, 6, 40, 9666, 2, 659, 7, 42, 5006, 3497, 430, 552, 187, 1206, 1527, 737, 437, 598, 7, 781, 36, 5, 158, 365, 233, 7, 1041, 24, 817, 155, 2, 77, 24, 139, 1043, 737, 100, 664, 7, 2211, 6, 24, 5, 175, 339, 236, 253, 294, 5, 2610, 581, 1602, 52, 91, 115, 25, 10, 67, 18, 53, 98, 6, 1305, 24, 10, 83, 14, 53, 2, 63, 25, 10, 562, 14, 53, 3, 686, 1, 1043, 878, 11, 1546, 20, 1014, 34, 141, 2423, 1388, 375, 132, 31, 78, 49, 3679, 94, 224, 17, 154, 61, 855, 3932, 3731, 2, 1504, 3458, 37, 187, 8, 4399, 2, 2275, 775, 4, 55, 1, 2198, 20, 1033, 552, 37, 21, 2060, 17, 7596, 3579, 2, 154, 61, 64, 675, 855, 16, 8, 2668, 2, 323, 36, 9, 552, 2, 17, 154, 61, 855, 36, 122, 2977, 3939, 250, 759, 483, 187, 2109, 2777, 2198, 55]",1797.0,24723493,187

Evaluation of bendamustine in combination with fludarabine in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.,Blood,Blood,2014-04-18,"The fludarabine and cyclophosphamide couplet has become the backbone of the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) standard of care. Although this is an effective treatment, it results in untoward toxicity. Bendamustine is a newly approved and better-tolerated alkylating agent. We hypothesized that similar to cyclophosphamide, bendamustine-induced DNA damage will be inhibited by fludarabine, resulting in increased cytotoxicity. To test this hypothesis and the role of the stromal microenvironment in this process, we treated CLL lymphocytes in vitro with each drug alone and in combination. Simultaneous or prior addition of fludarabine to bendamustine resulted in maximum cytotoxicity assayed by 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodine negativity, annexin positivity, and poly (adenosine 5'-diphosphate-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Cytotoxicity elicited by combination of both agents was similar in these malignant B cells cultured either in suspension or on marrow stroma cells. Cell death was associated with DNA damage response, which was determined by phosphorylation of H2AX and unscheduled DNA synthesis. H2AX activation was maximum with the drug combination, and unscheduled DNA synthesis induced by bendamustine was blocked by fludarabine. In parallel, ATM, Chk2, and p53 were phosphorylated and PUMA was induced. Cell death was caspase independent; however, caspases did decrease levels of Mcl-1 survival protein.

Stimulation of the B-cell receptor activates the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.,Blood,Blood,2014-04-28,"In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), stimulation of the B-cell receptor (BCR) triggers survival signals. Because in various cells activation of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway provides cells with survival advantage, we wondered whether BCR stimulation activates the JAK/STAT pathway in CLL cells. To stimulate the BCR we incubated CLL cells with anti-IgM antibodies. Anti-IgM antibodies induced transient tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear localization of phosphorylated (p) STAT3. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that anti-JAK2 antibodies coimmunoprecipitated pSTAT3 and pJAK2 in IgM-stimulated but not unstimulated CLL cells, suggesting that activation of the BCR induces activation of JAK2, which phosphorylates STAT3.

Development of a comprehensive prognostic index for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2014-05-05,"In addition to clinical staging, a number of biomarkers predicting overall survival (OS) have been identified in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The multiplicity of markers, limited information on their independent prognostic value, and a lack of understanding of how to interpret discordant markers are major barriers to use in routine clinical practice. We therefore performed an analysis of 23 prognostic markers based on prospectively collected data from 1948 CLL patients participating in phase 3 trials of the German CLL Study Group to develop a comprehensive prognostic index. A multivariable Cox regression model identified 8 independent predictors of OS: sex, age, ECOG status, del(17p), del(11q), IGHV mutation status, serum β2-microglobulin, and serum thymidine kinase. Using a weighted grading system, a prognostic index was derived that separated 4 risk categories with 5-year OS ranging from 18.7% to 95.2% and having a C-statistic of 0.75. The index stratified OS within all analyzed subgroups, including all Rai/Binet stages. The validity of the index was externally confirmed in a series of 676 newly diagnosed CLL patients from Mayo Clinic. Using this multistep process including external validation, we developed a comprehensive prognostic index with high discriminatory power and prognostic significance on the individual patient level.

Kinetics of CLL cells in tissues and blood during therapy with the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib.,Blood,Blood,2014-05-14,"The Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib has excellent clinical activity in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Characteristically, ibrutinib causes CLL cell redistribution from tissue sites into the peripheral blood during the initial weeks of therapy. To better characterize the dynamics of this redistribution phenomenon, we correlated serial lymphocyte counts with volumetric changes in lymph node and spleen sizes during ibrutinib therapy. Kinetic parameters were estimated by applying a mathematical model to the data. We found that during ibrutinib therapy, 1.7% ± 1.1% of blood CLL cells and 2.7% ± 0.99% of tissue CLL cells die per day. The fraction of the tissue CLL cells that was redistributed into the blood during therapy was estimated to be 23.3% ± 17% of the total tissue disease burden.

STAT3-activated GM-CSFRα translocates to the nucleus and protects CLL cells from apoptosis.,Molecular cancer research : MCR,Mol. Cancer Res.,2014-05-16,"Here, it was determined that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells express the α subunit, but not the β subunit, of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (GM-CSFR/CSF2R). GM-CSFRα was detected on the surface, in the cytosol, and in the nucleus of CLL cells via confocal microscopy, cell fractionation, and GM-CSFRα antibody epitope mapping. Because STAT3 is frequently activated in CLL and the GM-CSFRα promoter harbors putative STAT3 consensus binding sites, MM1 cells were transfected with truncated forms of the GM-CSFRα promoter, then stimulated with IL6 to activate STAT3 and to identify STAT3-binding sites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and an electoromobility shift assay (EMSA) confirmed STAT3 occupancy to those promoter regions in both IL6-stimulated MM1 and CLL cells. Transfection of MM1 cells with STAT3-siRNA or CLL cells with STAT3-shRNA significantly downregulated GM-CSFRα mRNA and protein levels. RNA transcripts, involved in regulating cell survival pathways, and the proteins KAP1 (TRIM28) and ISG15 coimmunoprecipitated with GM-CSFRα. GM-CSFRα-bound KAP1 enhanced the transcriptional activity of STAT3, whereas GM-CSFRα-bound ISG15 inhibited the NF-κB pathway. Nevertheless, overexpression of GM-CSFRα protected MM1 cells from dexamethasone-induced apoptosis, and GM-CSFRα knockdown induced apoptosis in CLL cells, suggesting that GM-CSFRα provides a ligand-independent survival advantage.

Prognostic information and biological insights in chronic lymphocytic leukemia by high-resolution immunophenotypic analysis of ZAP70.,Cytometry. Part A : the journal of the International Society for Analytical Cytology,Cytometry A,2014-05-20,"The E2997 Phase III trial included preservation of valuable chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient specimens and relevant clinical outcome data. Using a novel high-resolution technology on a flow cytometry platform, we assessed 79 E2997 samples for the expression of 27 analytes that reflected the activity of signaling pathways and apoptosis. We found that the expression levels of ZAP70 segregated the samples into two subpopulations with the distribution showing a peak-trough-peak configuration. Although prior assessment of ZAP70 by standard procedures did not reveal any prognostic information, we found by using the trough in the distribution as a cutpoint that ZAP70 expression levels were significantly correlated with both progression-free survival and overall survival. Additionally, the cells expressing high versus low levels of ZAP70 demonstrated distinct molecular organization as indicated by the other analytes assessed.

In preclinical models, lenalidomide acted synergistically with rituximab. The CLL Research Consortium initiated a phase II study to evaluate this combination in treatment-naive patients. Lenalidomide was initiated at 2.5 mg/day and was escalated based on treatment tolerability to a maximum of 10 mg/day, for 21 days/cycle, for a maximum of seven cycles. Rituximab was administered at the end of cycle 1 and was continued for seven cycles. Patients received allopurinol and aspirin for prophylaxis. Sixty-nine patients enrolled onto one of two age-specific strata; patients' median age was 56 and 70 years for arms A and B, respectively. Patients in the older-patient stratum more frequently had elevated serum beta-2 microglobulin levels, high-risk Rai stage, and were less likely to complete the maximum planned therapy. Adverse events were similar in the two arms. Nonhematologic toxicity was predominantly at grade 1/2, and neutropenia was the most common hematologic adverse event. The response rate for arm A was 95%, with 20% complete responses (CRs) and 20% nodular partial responses. Of arm B patients, 78% achieved a response, of which 11% were CRs. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 19 months for the younger cohort and 20 months for the older cohort. Intrapatient dose-escalation was safe.

Validation of ZAP-70 methylation and its relative significance in predicting outcome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2014-05-27,"ZAP-70 methylation 223 nucleotides downstream of transcription start (CpG+223) predicts outcome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but its impact relative to CD38 and ZAP-70 expression or immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) status is uncertain. Additionally, standardizing ZAP-70 expression analysis has been unsuccessful. CpG+223 methylation was quantitatively determined in 295 untreated CLL cases using MassARRAY. Impact on clinical outcome vs CD38 and ZAP-70 expression and IGHV status was evaluated. Cases with low methylation (<20%) had significantly shortened time to first treatment (TT) and overall survival (OS) (P < .0001). For TT, low methylation defined a large subset of ZAP-70 protein-negative cases with significantly shortened TT (median, 8.0 vs 3.9 years for high vs low methylation; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.74). Conversely, 16 ZAP-70 protein-positive cases with high methylation had poor outcome (median, 1.1 vs 2.3 years for high vs low methylation; HR = 1.62; 95% CI, 0.87-3.03). For OS, ZAP-70 methylation was the strongest risk factor; CD38 and ZAP-70 expression or IGHV status did not significantly improve OS prediction. A pyrosequencing assay was established that reproduced the MassARRAY data (κ coefficient > 0.90).

Resistance mechanisms for the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2014-05-28,"Ibrutinib is an irreversible inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and is effective in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Resistance to irreversible kinase inhibitors and resistance associated with BTK inhibition have not been characterized. Although only a small proportion of patients have had a relapse during ibrutinib therapy, an understanding of resistance mechanisms is important. We evaluated patients with relapsed disease to identify mutations that may mediate ibrutinib resistance. We performed whole-exome sequencing at baseline and the time of relapse on samples from six patients with acquired resistance to ibrutinib therapy. We then performed functional analysis of identified mutations. In addition, we performed Ion Torrent sequencing for identified resistance mutations on samples from nine patients with prolonged lymphocytosis. We identified a cysteine-to-serine mutation in BTK at the binding site of ibrutinib in five patients and identified three distinct mutations in PLCγ2 in two patients. Functional analysis showed that the C481S mutation of BTK results in a protein that is only reversibly inhibited by ibrutinib. The R665W and L845F mutations in PLCγ2 are both potentially gain-of-function mutations that lead to autonomous B-cell-receptor activity. These mutations were not found in any of the patients with prolonged lymphocytosis who were taking ibrutinib. Resistance to the irreversible BTK inhibitor ibrutinib often involves mutation of a cysteine residue where ibrutinib binding occurs. This finding, combined with two additional mutations in PLCγ2 that are immediately downstream of BTK, underscores the importance of the B-cell-receptor pathway in the mechanism of action of ibrutinib in CLL.

Although several features can be useful in the diagnosis of CLL, the most important is the immunophenotype.Two staging systems--the Binet system and the Rai classification--are used to assess risk. After diagnosis, the first major therapeutic decision is when to initiate therapy, as a watchful waiting approach is often appropriate for patients with asymptomatic disease. Once a patient has met the criteria for treatment, the choice of therapy is the next major decision. Younger patients (<65 years) often receive more aggressive treatment that typically consists of cytotoxic chemotherapy. There is a great unmet need concerning treatment of older patients with CLL, who often present with more comorbid conditions that can decrease their ability to tolerate particular regimens. The current standard of care for older patients with CLL is rituximab plus chlorambucil. The concept of targeted agents is currently an area of intense interest in CLL. The Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib is the targeted agent that is furthest along in clinical development. It is associated with an overall survival rate of 83%.

This study compared outcomes of myeloablative (MA) and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) transplants from HLA-matched sibling donors (MSD) for CLL. From 1995 to 2007, information regarding 297 CLL subjects was reported to the Center of International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research; of these, 163 underwent MA and 134 underwent RIC MSD HCT. The MA subjects underwent transplantation less often after 2000 and less commonly received antithymocyte globulin (4% versus 13%, P = .004) or prior antibody therapy (14% versus 53%; P < .001). RIC was associated with a greater likelihood of platelet recovery and less grade 2 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease compared with MA conditioning.

Med.,2014-05-31,"In patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), a short duration of response to therapy or adverse cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with a poor outcome. We evaluated the efficacy of ibrutinib, a covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, in patients at risk for a poor outcome. In this multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study, we randomly assigned 391 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL to receive daily ibrutinib or the anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab. The primary end point was the duration of progression-free survival, with the duration of overall survival and the overall response rate as secondary end points. At a median follow-up of 9.4 months, ibrutinib significantly improved progression-free survival; the median duration was not reached in the ibrutinib group (with a rate of progression-free survival of 88% at 6 months), as compared with a median of 8.1 months in the ofatumumab group (hazard ratio for progression or death in the ibrutinib group, 0.22; P<0.001). Ibrutinib also significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.43; P=0.005). At 12 months, the overall survival rate was 90% in the ibrutinib group and 81% in the ofatumumab group. The overall response rate was significantly higher in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group (42.6% vs. 4.1%, P<0.001). An additional 20% of ibrutinib-treated patients had a partial response with lymphocytosis. Similar effects were observed regardless of whether patients had a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion or resistance to purine analogues. The most frequent nonhematologic adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, and nausea in the ibrutinib group and fatigue, infusion-related reactions, and cough in the ofatumumab group. Ibrutinib, as compared with ofatumumab, significantly improved progression-free survival, overall survival, and response rate among patients with previously treated CLL or SLL.

Systematic identification of personal tumor-specific neoantigens in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2014-06-02,"Genome sequencing has revealed a large number of shared and personal somatic mutations across human cancers. In principle, any genetic alteration affecting a protein-coding region has the potential to generate mutated peptides that are presented by surface HLA class I proteins that might be recognized by cytotoxic T cells. To test this possibility, we implemented a streamlined approach for the prediction and validation of such neoantigens derived from individual tumors and presented by patient-specific HLA alleles. We applied our computational pipeline to 91 chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLLs) that underwent whole-exome sequencing (WES). We predicted ∼22 mutated HLA-binding peptides per leukemia (derived from ∼16 missense mutations) and experimentally confirmed HLA binding for ∼55% of such peptides. Two CLL patients that achieved long-term remission following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were monitored for CD8(+) T-cell responses against predicted or confirmed HLA-binding peptides. Long-lived cytotoxic T-cell responses were detected against peptides generated from personal tumor mutations in ALMS1, C6ORF89, and FNDC3B presented on tumor cells. Finally, we applied our computational pipeline to WES data (N = 2488 samples) across 13 different cancer types and estimated dozens to thousands of predicted neoantigens per individual tumor, suggesting that neoantigens are frequent in most tumors.

Utility of quantitative flow cytometry immunophenotypic analysis of CD5 expression in small B-cell neoplasms.,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med.,2014-07-01,"The value of assessing CD5 expression in the differential diagnosis of small B-cell neoplasms is well established. Assessment is usually done qualitatively. To assess CD5 expression levels by quantitative flow cytometry immunophenotyping and to determine possible differences among various small B-cell neoplasms. We performed 4-color flow cytometry analysis on specimens of peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate and quantified CD5 expression in various small B-cell lymphomas and leukemias. We also assessed CD5 levels in peripheral blood samples of healthy blood donors. Cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma had higher levels of CD5 compared with control B cells (P < .001). Cases of marginal zone lymphoma and hairy cell leukemia had CD5 levels similar to control B cells (P = .35 and P = .14, respectively), whereas cases of follicular lymphoma and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma had significantly lower CD5 levels than control B cells (P < .001 and P = .04, respectively). In B-cell neoplasms, a high level of CD5 expression was correlated with a homogeneous pattern of positive events, whereas lower CD5 levels were correlated with heterogeneous patterns of positive events. Using flow cytometric immunophenotypic analysis to quantify CD5 levels can aid in diagnosis.

PKC-β as a therapeutic target in CLL: PKC inhibitor AEB071 demonstrates preclinical activity in CLL.,Blood,Blood,2014-07-07,"Targeting B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has been successful with durable remissions observed with several targeted therapeutics. Protein kinase C-β (PKC-β) is immediately downstream of BCR and has been shown to be essential to CLL cell survival and proliferation in vivo. We therefore evaluated sotrastaurin (AEB071), an orally administered potent PKC inhibitor, on CLL cell survival both in vitro and in vivo. AEB071 shows selective cytotoxicity against B-CLL cells in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, AEB071 attenuates BCR-mediated survival pathways, inhibits CpG-induced survival and proliferation of CLL cells in vitro, and effectively blocks microenvironment-mediated survival signaling pathways in primary CLL cells. Furthermore, AEB071 alters β-catenin expression, resulting in decreased downstream transcriptional genes as c-Myc, Cyclin D1, and CD44. Lastly, our preliminary in vivo studies indicate beneficial antitumor properties of AEB071 in CLL. Taken together, our results indicate that targeting PKC-β has the potential to disrupt signaling from the microenvironment contributing to CLL cell survival and potentially drug resistance. Future efforts targeting PKC with the PKC inhibitor AEB071 as monotherapy in clinical trials of relapsed and refractory CLL patients are warranted.",Journal Article,2024.0,27.0,Targeting B-cell receptor BCR signaling in chronic lymphocytic CLL has been successful with durable remissions observed with several targeted therapeutics Protein kinase C-β PKC-β is immediately downstream of BCR and has been shown to be essential to CLL cell survival and proliferation in vivo We therefore evaluated sotrastaurin AEB071 an orally administered potent PKC inhibitor on CLL cell survival both in vitro and in vivo AEB071 shows selective cytotoxicity against B-CLL cells in a dose-dependent manner Additionally AEB071 attenuates BCR-mediated survival pathways inhibits CpG-induced survival and proliferation of CLL cells in vitro and effectively blocks microenvironment-mediated survival signaling pathways in primary CLL cells Furthermore AEB071 alters β-catenin expression resulting in decreased downstream transcriptional genes as c-Myc Cyclin D1 and CD44 Lastly our preliminary in vivo studies indicate beneficial antitumor properties of AEB071 in CLL Taken together our results indicate that targeting PKC-β has the potential to disrupt signaling from the microenvironment contributing to CLL cell survival and potentially drug resistance Future efforts targeting PKC with the PKC inhibitor AEB071 as monotherapy in clinical trials of relapsed and refractory CLL patients are warranted,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[529, 132, 31, 153, 1062, 314, 4, 442, 1193, 552, 71, 85, 1401, 5, 1480, 3166, 164, 5, 392, 238, 1943, 178, 216, 256, 1458, 4644, 1458, 16, 3467, 1489, 1, 1062, 2, 71, 85, 443, 6, 40, 1452, 6, 552, 31, 25, 2, 457, 4, 386, 21, 673, 194, 40004, 19305, 35, 1428, 468, 1157, 4644, 230, 23, 552, 31, 25, 110, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 19305, 1949, 1094, 1408, 480, 132, 552, 37, 4, 8, 61, 470, 1708, 1724, 19305, 9100, 1062, 517, 25, 460, 1576, 2075, 277, 25, 2, 457, 1, 552, 37, 4, 439, 2, 1856, 2860, 995, 517, 25, 314, 460, 4, 86, 552, 37, 798, 19305, 6745, 1458, 1778, 55, 1113, 4, 340, 1489, 1431, 214, 22, 256, 1371, 1226, 2146, 2, 3035, 6354, 114, 1676, 4, 386, 94, 1008, 2524, 579, 1571, 1, 19305, 4, 552, 1633, 1162, 114, 99, 1008, 17, 529, 4644, 1458, 71, 3, 174, 6, 6619, 314, 29, 3, 995, 3156, 6, 552, 31, 25, 2, 751, 234, 251, 508, 1413, 529, 4644, 5, 3, 4644, 230, 19305, 22, 1411, 4, 38, 143, 1, 591, 2, 430, 552, 7, 32, 1197]",1304.0,25001469,273
FCR and bevacizumab treatment in patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2014-07-15,"Patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) often achieve response with chemoimmunotherapy but have short remission durations. Studies have shown that patients with CLL have increased angiogenesis in the microenvironment; levels of proangiogenic growth factors such as VEGF and/or angiopoietin-2 are also elevated. Increased angiogenesis correlates with poor outcome in CLL. Bevacizumab (B) is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF-A. In this study, we analyzed whether a combination of bevacizumab with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab chemoimmunotherapy (FCR-B) could improve outcomes in patients with relapsed CLL. Sixty-two patients were enrolled. The median age of the patients was 60 years (range, 31-84 years) and 40% had received >1 prior therapy for CLL. Sixty-one patients were evaluable for toxicity, and 57 were evaluable for response. Six cycles were planned; 36 patients (59%) completed ≥4-6 cycles of the regimen. The overall response rate was 79%, with 13 (23%) complete remissions (CRs), 8 nodular partial remissions (14%), and 24 partial remissions (43%).

However, the introduction of B-cell receptor (BCR) kinase inhibitors such as ibrutinib has the potential to eliminate the role of chemotherapy in the treatment of CLL. How to best incorporate old and new therapies for CLL in this landscape is increasingly complex. This article reviews current data available to clinicians and integrates these data to provide a strategy that can be used to approach the treatment of CLL in the era of BCR signaling inhibitors. Current strategies separate patients based on age or functional status as well as genetics [presence or absence of del(17)(p13.1)].

"MYC-associated and double-hit lymphomas: a review of pathobiology, prognosis, and therapeutic approaches.",Cancer,Cancer,2014-07-24,"Aberrant expression of the v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC) proto-oncogene has known transformative potential in healthy human cells. Chromosomal MYC rearrangements and consequent MYC overexpression is the defining lesion in Burkitt lymphoma (BL), conferring a highly proliferative state. However, abnormalities of MYC are increasingly appreciated in non-BL histologies, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and B-cell lymphomas intermediate between BL and DLBCL, with a particularly aggressive clinical phenotype. Although there are conflicting data regarding prognostic implications of isolated MYC aberrancy in these non-BLs, the co-occurrence of MYC rearrangements and either the antiapoptotic gene B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) or the transcriptional repressor BCL6 leads to an entity termed double-hit B-cell lymphoma (DHL) (or triple-hit if all 3 abnormalities are observed) with a particularly poor prognosis and no established treatment paradigms. Notably, a distinct pattern of gene expression profiling has been noted when MYC is overexpressed in BL compared with other lymphomas, supporting the notion that, although MYC promotes target gene transcription, the target genes vary by disease subtype. The frequency of MYC activity depends on the method of detection and ranges from 5% to 10% using fluorescence in situ hybridization but up to 30% of DLBCL using immunohistochemistry. Standard therapies developed for DLBCL are less effective when the disease is driven by MYC, leading to lower response rates and response durations. An important clinical challenge is to pre-emptively identify MYC-associated lymphomas and to subsequently develop trials specifically for this group of patients. However, the design of such studies is complicated by variable definitions of MYC-associated lymphoid malignancies and the lack of effective therapies to date.

"Safety and activity of ibrutinib plus rituximab for patients with high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukaemia: a single-arm, phase 2 study.",The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2014-08-20,"Ibrutinib, an orally administered covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), is an effective treatment for relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). We investigated the activity and safety of the combination of ibrutinib with the monoclonal antibody rituximab in patients with high-risk CLL. In this single-arm phase 2 study, we enrolled adult patients with high-risk CLL at the MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA). All enrolled participants had high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities (deletion 17p, TP53 mutation, or deletion 11q) or a short progression-free survival (PFS <36 months) after previous first-line chemoimmunotherapy. Patients with symptomatic disease requiring therapy received 28-day cycles of once-daily ibrutinib 420 mg together with rituximab (375 mg/m(2), intravenously, every week during cycle 1, then once per cycle until cycle 6), followed by continuous daily single-agent ibrutinib 420 mg until disease progression or until toxicities or complications precluded further treatment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01520519, and is no longer accruing patients. Between Feb 28, 2012, and Sept 11, 2012, we enrolled 40 patients with CLL with high-risk disease features, 20 of whom had deletion 17p (del[17p]) or TP53 mutations (16 previously treated, four untreated), 13 had relapsed CLL with deletion 11q (del[11q]), and seven a PFS less than 36 months after first-line chemoimmunotherapy. 18-month PFS in all patients was 78·0% (95% CI 60·6-88·5), whereas in those with a del(17p) or TP53 mutation it was 72·4% (45·6-87·6) Toxicity was mainly mild to moderate in severity (grade 1-2). Diarrhoea occurred in ten (25%) patients (grade 1 in nine patients and grade 2 in one), bleeding events in 14 (33%) patients (eight grade 1 and five grade 2), nausea or vomiting in 15 patients (38%) (ten grade 1 and five grade 2), and fatigue in seven (18%) patients (four grade 1 and three grade 2).

Chemotherapy-refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and indolent B-cell malignancies can be effectively treated with autologous T cells expressing an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2014-08-25,"T cells can be genetically modified to express an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). We assessed the safety and efficacy of administering autologous anti-CD19 CAR T cells to patients with advanced CD19(+) B-cell malignancies. We treated 15 patients with advanced B-cell malignancies. Nine patients had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), two had indolent lymphomas, and four had chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Patients received a conditioning chemotherapy regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by a single infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells. Of 15 patients, eight achieved complete remissions (CRs), four achieved partial remissions, one had stable lymphoma, and two were not evaluable for response. CRs were obtained by four of seven evaluable patients with chemotherapy-refractory DLBCL; three of these four CRs are ongoing, with durations ranging from 9 to 22 months. Acute toxicities including fever, hypotension, delirium, and other neurologic toxicities occurred in some patients after infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells; these toxicities resolved within 3 weeks after cell infusion. One patient died suddenly as a result of an unknown cause 16 days after cell infusion. CAR T cells were detected in the blood of patients at peak levels, ranging from nine to 777 CAR-positive T cells/μL. This is the first report to our knowledge of successful treatment of DLBCL with anti-CD19 CAR T cells. These results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of treating chemotherapy-refractory B-cell malignancies with anti-CD19 CAR T cells.

A number of studies have evaluated associations between risk factors and CLL/SLL risk. However, these associations remain inconsistent or lacked confirmation. This may be due, in part, to the inadequate sample size of CLL/SLL cases. We performed a pooled analysis of 2440 CLL/SLL cases and 15186 controls from 13 case-control studies from Europe, North America, and Australia. We evaluated associations of medical history, family history, lifestyle, and occupational risk factors with CLL/SLL risk. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We confirmed prior inverse associations with any atopic condition and recreational sun exposure. We also confirmed prior elevated associations with usual adult height, hepatitis C virus seropositivity, living or working on a farm, and family history of any hematological malignancy. Novel associations were identified with hairdresser occupation (OR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.05 to 2.98) and blood transfusion history (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.66 to 0.94). We also found smoking to have modest protective effect (OR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.81 to 0.99). All exposures showed evidence of independent effects. We have identified or confirmed several independent risk factors for CLL/SLL supporting a role for genetics (through family history), immune function (through allergy and sun), infection (through hepatitis C virus), and height, and other pathways of immune response.

Risk factors for Richter syndrome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Current hematologic malignancy reports,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,2014-09-01,"Richter syndrome (RS) is defined as the transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) to a more aggressive B-cell lymphoma, most commonly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Approximately 5-10% of CLL patients develop this complication during long-term follow-up. Traditional risk factors for future RS include clinical (advanced Rai stage), biological (ZAP-70, CD38, CD49d) and genetic (del17p, del11q) characteristics at the time of CLL diagnosis. The impact of CLL therapy (purine-nucleoside analogue and/or alkylator-based chemoimmunotherapy and kinase inhibitor therapy) on the risk of RS remains controversial. Both heritable (germline) and acquired (somatic) genetic mutations contribute to risk of RS.

Elevated monoclonal and polyclonal serum immunoglobulin free light chain as prognostic factors in B- and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2014-09-26,"The serum immunoglobulin free light chain (FLC) assay quantitates free kappa (κ) and lambda (λ) light chains. FLC elevations in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are associated with an inferior survival. These increases in FLC can be monoclonal (as in myeloma) or polyclonal. The goal was to estimate the frequency of these elevations within distinct types of B-cell and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and whether the FLC measurements are associated with event-free survival (EFS). We studied serum for FLC abnormalities using normal laboratory reference ranges to define an elevated κ or λ FLC. Elevations were further classified as polyclonal or monoclonal. Four hundred ninety-two patients were studied: 453 B-cell and 34 T-cell NHL patients. Twenty-nine % (142/453) of patients had an elevated FLC of which 10% were monoclonal elevations. Within B-cell NHL, FLC abnormalities were most common in lymphoplasmacytic (79%), mantle cell (68%), and lymphomas of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (31%); they were least common in follicular (15%). The hazard ratio (HR) for EFS in all patients was 1.41 (95% CI; 1.11-1.81); in all B-cell NHL the HR was 1.44 (95% CI 1.11-1.96); in all T-cell NHL the HR was 1.17 (95% CI 0.55-2.49). FLC abnormalities predicted an inferior OS (HR = 2.75, 95% CI: 1.93-3.90, P < 0.0001). The serum FLC assay is useful for prognosis in both B-cell and T-cell types of NHL.

Previous studies have shown that an oral PI3K p110δ inhibitor idelalisib exhibits promising activity in CLL. Here, we demonstrate that a dual PI3K p110δ and p110γ inhibitor, IPI-145, antagonizes BCR crosslinking activated prosurvival signals in primary CLL cells. IPI-145 causes direct killing in primary CLL cells in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, but does not generate direct cytotoxicity to normal B cells. However, IPI-145 does reduce the viability of normal T and natural killer cells and decrease activated T-cell production of various inflammatory and antiapoptotic cytokines. Furthermore, IPI-145 overcomes the ibrutinib resistance resulting from treatment-induced BTK C481S mutation.

OSU-T315: a novel targeted therapeutic that antagonizes AKT membrane localization and activation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.,Blood,Blood,2014-10-07,"Aberrant regulation of endogenous survival pathways plays a major role in progression of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Signaling via conjugation of surface receptors within the tumor environmental niche activates survival and proliferation pathways in CLL. Of these, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway appears to be pivotal to support CLL pathogenesis, and pharmacologic inhibitors targeting this axis have shown clinical activity. Here we investigate OSU-T315, a compound that disrupts the PI3K/AKT pathway in a novel manner. Dose-dependent selective cytotoxicity by OSU-T315 is noted in both CLL-derived cell lines and primary CLL cells relative to normal lymphocytes. In contrast to the highly successful Bruton's tyrosine kinase and PI3K inhibitors that inhibit B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway at proximal kinases, OSU-T315 directly abrogates AKT activation by preventing translocation of AKT into lipid rafts without altering the activation of receptor-associated kinases. Through this mechanism, the agent triggers caspase-dependent apoptosis in CLL by suppressing BCR, CD49d, CD40, and Toll-like receptor 9-mediated AKT activation in an integrin-linked kinase-independent manner. In vivo, OSU-T315 attains pharmacologically active drug levels and significantly prolongs survival in the TCL1 mouse model.

The complexity of CLL with respect to different chromosomal aberrations, lack of a common aberrant signaling pathway activation, and associated immune suppression of the disease has been seen a major stumbling block for developing a single targeted therapy similar to imatinib used in chronic myeloid leukemia. The upcoming therapeutic era we are entering with the B-cell receptor (BCR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors ibrutinib and idelalisib appears to be overcoming this obstacle. Indeed, for the large majority of patients, it appears that application of BCR kinase inhibitors can promote durable remissions without the need for chemotherapy. Where other very active targeted agents such as ABT-199, therapeutic antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor-modified T-cells will be used in CLL also represents a major question that future clinical trials will answer.",Journal Article,1932.0,35.0,Over the past two decades slow but deliberate progress has been made in understanding the genetics of chronic lymphocytic CLL and how the surrounding microenvironment influences cell survival The complexity of CLL with respect to different chromosomal aberrations lack of a common aberrant signaling pathway activation and associated immune suppression of the disease has been seen a major stumbling block for developing a single targeted therapy similar to imatinib used in chronic myeloid The upcoming therapeutic era we are entering with the B-cell receptor BCR tyrosine kinase inhibitors ibrutinib and idelalisib appears to be overcoming this obstacle Indeed for the large majority of patients it appears that application of BCR kinase inhibitors can promote durable remissions without the need for chemotherapy Where other very active targeted agents such as ABT-199 therapeutic antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor-modified T-cells will be used in CLL also represents a major question that future clinical trials will answer,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[252, 3, 1219, 100, 1968, 3645, 84, 22058, 1466, 71, 85, 1229, 4, 612, 3, 2894, 1, 442, 1193, 552, 2, 832, 3, 2976, 995, 3859, 31, 25, 3, 3082, 1, 552, 5, 2184, 6, 338, 1860, 2152, 926, 1, 8, 186, 1898, 314, 308, 363, 2, 41, 250, 1332, 1, 3, 34, 71, 85, 527, 8, 458, 37449, 2381, 9, 931, 8, 226, 238, 36, 288, 6, 577, 95, 4, 442, 533, 3, 11974, 189, 1713, 21, 32, 7653, 5, 3, 132, 31, 153, 1062, 564, 216, 222, 1795, 2, 7083, 1233, 6, 40, 5344, 26, 7414, 4462, 9, 3, 375, 686, 1, 7, 192, 1233, 17, 1581, 1, 1062, 216, 222, 122, 1617, 1480, 3166, 187, 3, 594, 9, 56, 1257, 127, 923, 544, 238, 183, 225, 22, 3095, 5840, 189, 890, 2, 2897, 448, 153, 1230, 102, 37, 303, 40, 95, 4, 552, 120, 1449, 8, 458, 2840, 17, 508, 38, 143, 303, 6634]",1034.0,25294898,228
A phase 1 trial of the Fc-engineered CD19 antibody XmAb5574 (MOR00208) demonstrates safety and preliminary efficacy in relapsed CLL.,Blood,Blood,2014-10-09,"CD19 is ubiquitously expressed on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and is therefore an attractive candidate for antibody targeting. XmAb5574 (aka MOR00208) is a novel humanized CD19 monoclonal antibody with an engineered Fc region to enhance Fcγ receptor binding affinity. Here we report results of a first in human phase 1 trial of XmAb5574 in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. Twenty-seven patients were enrolled to 6 escalating dose levels, with expansion at the highest dose level of 12 mg/kg. Nine doses of XmAb5574 were infused over 8 weeks. No maximal tolerated dose was reached, and the drug was generally well tolerated, with infusion reactions of grades 1 and 2 being the most common toxicities. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities occurred in 5 patients and included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, febrile neutropenia, and tumor lysis syndrome. XmAb5574 showed preliminary efficacy, with 18 patients (66.7%) responding by physical examination criteria and laboratory studies, and 8 patients (29.6%) responding by computed tomography criteria. Pharmacokinetics showed a half-life of 14 days with clearance that was not dose-dependent. In conclusion, this phase 1 trial demonstrates safety and preliminary efficacy of a novel Fc-engineered CD19 monoclonal antibody XmAb5574 and justifies movement into the phase 2 setting.

Deep sequencing identifies genetic heterogeneity and recurrent convergent evolution in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2014-11-06,"Recent high-throughput sequencing and microarray studies have characterized the genetic landscape and clonal complexity of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Here, we performed a longitudinal study in a homogeneously treated cohort of 12 patients, with sequential samples obtained at comparable stages of disease. We identified clonal competition between 2 or more genetic subclones in 70% of the patients with relapse, and stable clonal dynamics in the remaining 30%. By deep sequencing, we identified a high reservoir of genetic heterogeneity in the form of several driver genes mutated in small subclones underlying the disease course. Furthermore, in 2 patients, we identified convergent evolution, characterized by the combination of genetic lesions affecting the same genes or copy number abnormality in different subclones. The phenomenon affects multiple CLL putative driver abnormalities, including mutations in NOTCH1, SF3B1, DDX3X, and del(11q23).

"Population pharmacokinetic model of ibrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with B cell malignancies.",Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol.,2014-11-08,"Ibrutinib is an oral Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, recently approved for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with at least one prior therapy. We developed a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for ibrutinib in patients. Ibrutinib PK data (3,477 observations/245 patients) were available from the following clinical studies: (1) A phase I dose-escalation study in recurrent B cell malignancies (dose levels of 1.25-12.5 mg/kg/day and fixed dose of 560 mg/day); (2) a phase II study in MCL (fixed dose level of 560 mg/day); (3) a phase Ib/II dose-finding study in CLL (fixed dose levels of 420 and 840 mg/day). Different compartmental PK models were explored using nonlinear mixed effects modeling. A two-compartment PK model with sequential zero-first-order absorption and first-order elimination was able to characterize the PK of ibrutinib. The compound was rapidly absorbed, had a high oral plasma clearance (approximately 1,000 L/h) and a high apparent volume of distribution at steady state (approximately 10,000 L). PK parameters were not dependent on dose, study, or clinical indication. The fasting state was characterized by a 67 % relative bioavailability compared with the meal conditions used in the trials and administration after a high-fat meal.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a clinical review.,JAMA,JAMA,2014-12-01,"The most common leukemia is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Every year, there are 15 000 new diagnoses and 5000 CLL deaths in the United States. Although therapeutic choices were once limited, treatment of this disease has vastly improved in the last decade. Evidence-based review of the diagnosis, staging, and treatment of CLL. PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases were searched through August 28, 2014. English-language peer-reviewed articles published between 2000-2014 were found using the keywords chronic lymphocytic leukemia, upfront therapy, upfront therapies, upfront therapeutic, upfront therapeutics, upfront treatment, front-line treatment, first-line treatment, front-line treatments, first-line treatments, front-line therapy, front-line therapies, randomized, randomized studies, randomized study, clinical trial, clinical trials, phase 3, and phase 3 clinical trial. Abstracts and presentations at scientific meetings were excluded. A total of 277 articles were retrieved, of which 24 met our predefined selection criteria; treatment recommendations were based on subsequent analysis of these 24 articles. The Rai and Binet systems for staging CLL were established in 1975 and 1977, respectively. However, they do not account for new disease categories such as monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (peripheral blood clonal lymphocytosis that does not meet other criteria for CLL). Two subsets of CLL are now recognized based on risk stratification involving molecular and cytogenetic analyses. Outcomes are improved by the addition of immunotherapy to combination chemotherapy for initial treatment in all subsets of treated patients. Overall response rates between 75% and 90% and complete responses between 22% and 45% are expected in the current era, with more than 80% of treated patients alive at 3 years. Overall, 5-year survival has increased to 66% from 60% (P < .001) in the past 10 years.

Expression of executioner procaspases and their activation by a procaspase-activating compound in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.,Blood,Blood,2014-12-23,"Intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways converge to activate common downstream executioner caspases (caspase-3, -6, and -7), resulting in cell death. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), neoplastic B cells evade apoptosis owing to the overexpression of survival proteins. We hypothesized that direct activation of procaspases could bypass the apoptosis resistance induced by the upstream prosurvival proteins. The procaspase-activating compounds (PAC-1), including B-PAC-1 (L14R8), convert inactive executioner procaspases to their active cleaved forms by chelation of labile zinc ions. Both at transcript and protein levels, primary CLL cells express high levels of latent procaspases (3, -7, and -9). B-PAC-1 treatment induced CLL lymphocyte death which was higher than that in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells or B cells, and was independent of prognostic markers and microenvironmental factors. Mechanistically, B-PAC-1 treatment activated executioner procaspases and not other Zn-dependent enzymes. Exogenous zinc completely, and pancaspase inhibitors partially, reversed B-PAC-1-induced apoptosis, elucidating the zinc-mediated mechanism of action. The cell demise relied on the presence of caspase-3/7 but not caspase-8 or Bax/Bak proteins.

Among 3887 CLL patients seen at Mayo Clinic from January 1995 through August 2011, 26 (0.7%) developed HL. In a nested cohort of 2,465 newly diagnosed CLL patients followed prospectively, the incidence of HL was 0.05%/year (10 year risk = 0.5%). The median overall survival (OS) from date of HL diagnosis in patients with CLL/HL was 3.9 years compared to not reached for de novo HL patients (n = 709) seen during the same time interval (P < 0.001). The shorter OS of CLL/HL patients persisted after adjusting for differences in age and Ann Arbor stage of disease.

Enhancing antitumor efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor T cells through constitutive CD40L expression.,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,Mol. Ther.,2015-01-13,"Adoptive cell therapy with genetically modified T cells expressing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is a promising therapy for patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, CAR-modified T cells (CAR T cells) have mostly failed in patients with solid tumors or low-grade B-cell malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukemia with bulky lymph node involvement. Herein, we enhance the antitumor efficacy of CAR T cells through the constitutive expression of CD40 ligand (CD40L, CD154). T cells genetically modified to constitutively express CD40L (CD40L-modified T cells) demonstrated increased proliferation and secretion of proinflammatory TH1 cytokines. Further, CD40L-modified T cells augmented the immunogenicity of CD40(+) tumor cells by the upregulated surface expression of costimulatory molecules (CD80 and CD86), adhesion molecules (CD54, CD58, and CD70), human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules (Class I and HLA-DR), and the Fas-death receptor (CD95). Additionally, CD40L-modified T cells induced maturation and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-12 by monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Finally, tumor-targeted CD19-specific CAR/CD40L T cells exhibited increased cytotoxicity against CD40(+) tumors and extended the survival of tumor-bearing mice in a xenotransplant model of CD19(+) systemic lymphoma. This preclinical data supports the clinical application of CAR T cells additionally modified to constitutively express CD40L with anticipated enhanced antitumor efficacy.

Mutations were identified at significant frequency in all three series with a combined mutation frequency of 5.2% (37/709). Positive mutation status was found to be associated with unmutated IGHV and ZAP70 expression, which are well-known poor prognosis markers in CLL. Our results recognize CLL as the first extrauterine cancer type where 5'terminus of MED12 is mutated at significant frequency.

Up-regulation of CDK9 kinase activity and Mcl-1 stability contributes to the acquired resistance to cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in leukemia.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2015-02-01,"Flavopiridol is a small molecule inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) known to impair global transcription via inactivation of positive transcription elongation factor b. It has been demonstrated to have significant activity predominantly in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia in phase I/II clinical trials while other similar CDK inhibitors are vigorously being pursued in pre-clinical and clinical studies. Although flavopiridol is a potent therapeutic agent against blood diseases, some patients still have primary or acquired resistance throughout their clinical course. Considering the limited knowledge of resistance mechanisms of flavopiridol, we investigated the potential mechanisms of resistance to flavopiridol in a cell line system, which gradually acquired resistance to flavopiridol in vitro, and then confirmed the mechanism in patient samples. Herein, we present that this resistant cell line developed resistance through up-regulation of phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain, activation of CDK9 kinase activity, and prolonged Mcl-1 stability to counter flavopiridol's drug actions. Further analyses suggest MAPK/ERK activation-mediated Mcl-1 stabilization contributes to the resistance and knockdown of Mcl-1 in part restores sensitivity to flavopiridol-induced cytotoxicity. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that CDK9 is the most relevant target of flavopiridol and provide avenues to improve the therapeutic strategies in blood malignancies.

TCL1 targeting miR-3676 is codeleted with tumor protein p53 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2015-02-02,"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common human leukemia and dysregulation of the T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1 (TCL1) oncogene is a contributing event in the pathogenesis of the aggressive form of this disease based on transgenic mouse studies. To determine a role of microRNAs on the pathogenesis of the aggressive form of CLL we studied regulation of TCL1 expression in CLL by microRNAs. We identified miR-3676 as a regulator of TCL1 expression. We demonstrated that miR-3676 targets three consecutive 28-bp repeats within 3'UTR of TCL1 and showed that miR-3676 is a powerful inhibitor of TCL1. We further showed that miR-3676 expression is significantly down-regulated in four groups of CLL carrying the 11q deletions, 13q deletions, 17p deletions, or a normal karyotype compared with normal CD19(+) cord blood and peripheral blood B cells. In addition, the sequencing of 539 CLL samples revealed five germ-line mutations in six samples (1%) in miR-3676. Two of these mutations were loss-of-function mutations. Because miR-3676 is located at 17p13, only 500-kb centromeric of tumor protein p53 (Tp53), and is codeleted with Tp53, we propose that loss of miR-3676 causes high levels of TCL1 expression contributing to CLL progression.

Targeted Axl Inhibition Primes Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia B Cells to Apoptosis and Shows Synergistic/Additive Effects in Combination with BTK Inhibitors.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2015-02-11,"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an incurable disease despite aggressive therapeutic approaches. We previously found that Axl receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) plays a critical role in CLL B-cell survival. Here, we explored the possibility of using a high-affinity Axl inhibitor as a single agent or in combination with Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors for future clinical trial to treat patients with CLL. Expression/activation status of other members of the TAM (e.g., Tyro3, Axl, and MER) family of RTKs in CLL B cells was evaluated. Cells were treated with a high-affinity orally bioavailable Axl inhibitor TP-0903 with or without the presence of CLL bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Inhibitory effects of TP-0903 on the Axl signaling pathway were also evaluated in CLL B cells. Finally, cells were exposed to TP-0903 in combination with BTK inhibitors to determine any synergistic/additive effects of the combination. CLL B cells overexpress Tyro3, but not MER. Of interest, Tyro3 remains as constitutively phosphorylated and forms a complex with Axl in CLL B cells. TP-0903 induces massive apoptosis in CLL B cells with LD50 values of nanomolar ranges. Importantly, CLL BMSCs could not protect the leukemic B cells from TP-0903-induced apoptosis.

FISH subsets were compared using the median del11q FISH% (>58%, high vs. ≤58%, low). Overall survival (OS) and time to first treatment (TTFT) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier plots (log rank). Multivariate analysis was performed to assess the association between FISH% of del11q and outcomes. Patients with sole del11q were similar to del11q with del13q in terms of TTFT and OS. Patients with high FISH% of del11q had significantly shorter OS and TTFT as compared with patients with low FISH%, particularly in sole del11q; this negative impact of high FISH% of del11q on OS and TTFT was diminished with coexistent del13q. In multivariate analysis, high FISH% of del11q was a significant predictor for shorter OS and TTFT. A comparison of these del11q subsets with a separate cohort of (n = 673) previously untreated patients with sole del13q showed that the high FISH% del11q cohort had a significantly shorter TTFT and OS.

Three-year follow-up of treatment-naïve and previously treated patients with CLL and SLL receiving single-agent ibrutinib.,Blood,Blood,2015-02-19,"Ibrutinib is an orally administered inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase that antagonizes B-cell receptor, chemokine, and integrin-mediated signaling. In early-phase studies, ibrutinib demonstrated high response rates and prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The durable responses observed with ibrutinib relate in part to a modest toxicity profile that allows the majority of patients to receive continuous therapy for an extended period. We report on median 3-year follow-up of 132 patients with symptomatic treatment-naïve and relapsed/refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Longer treatment with ibrutinib was associated with improvement in response quality over time and durable remissions. Toxicity with longer follow-up diminished with respect to occurrence of grade 3 or greater cytopenias, fatigue, and infections. Progression remains uncommon, occurring primarily in some patients with relapsed del(17)(p13.1) and/or del(11)(q22.3) disease.

Epigenetic silencing of miR-708 enhances NF-κB signaling in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2015-03-13,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and their deregulation is involved in tumor development. Epigenetic gene silencing in cancer by DNA methylation contributes to the silencing of tumor-suppressor genes, including miRNAs. We have recently shown that the promoter of miR-708 is aberrantly methylated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To characterize the molecular signaling networks that are influenced by miR-708, we performed a luciferase-based screen evaluating the effects of ectopic miR-708 expression on leukemia-relevant signaling pathways. We found that miR-708 strongly repressed NF-κB signaling, a pathway known to be deregulated in CLL. Among the predicted miR-708 targets was IKKβ (inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells, kinase-β/IKBKB), a key kinase facilitating NF-κB signaling. We validated the interaction of miR-708 with the 3'-untranslated region of IKKβ and found that miR-708 overexpression represses endogenous IKKβ. Phosphorylation of the IKKβ target IκBα and expression of known NF-κB target genes were impaired by miR-708. Furthermore, we identified an enhancer region downstream of the miR-708 promoter that displays a distinct DNA methylation status in CLL. High enhancer methylation is significantly correlated with lower miR-708 expression and is predominantly found in patients with poor prognosis and shorter time to treatment. These results demonstrate that miR-708 regulates the NF-κB pathway by targeting IKKβ, and that methylation of a key enhancer region contributes to its suppression in CLL.

"Aberrant LPL Expression, Driven by STAT3, Mediates Free Fatty Acid Metabolism in CLL Cells.",Molecular cancer research : MCR,Mol. Cancer Res.,2015-03-02,"While reviewing chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) bone marrow slides, we identified cytoplasmic lipid vacuoles in CLL cells but not in normal B cells. Because lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which catalyzes hydrolysis of triglycerides into free fatty acids (FFA), is aberrantly expressed in CLL, we investigated whether LPL regulates the oxidative metabolic capacity of CLL cells. We found that unlike normal B cells, CLL cells metabolize FFAs. Because STAT3 is constitutively activated in CLL cells and because we identified putative STAT3 binding sites in the LPL promoter, we sought to determine whether STAT3 drives the aberrant expression of LPL. Transfection of luciferase reporter gene constructs driven by LPL promoter fragments into MM1 cells revealed that STAT3 activates the LPL promoter. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that STAT3 binds to the LPL promoter. Furthermore, transfection of CLL cells with STAT3-shRNA downregulated LPL transcripts and protein levels, confirming that STAT3 activates the LPL gene.

Patients with a diagnosis of CLL/SLL or NHL recorded in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database during 1992-2007 were identified. Diagnoses of specific skin malignancies were identified from SEER files. During 1992-2007, a total of 128,674 patients with first diagnoses of CLL/SLL or NHL were recorded in SEER; 4743 were excluded because follow-up data were unavailable. Among the remaining 123,931 patients, 28,964 had CLL/SLL and 94,967 had NHL. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for invasive malignant melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, Kaposi's sarcoma, and sebaceous carcinoma were 2.3, 8.2, 3.6, 2.5, 2.9, and 1.4, respectively, in CLL/SLL patients and 1.6, 3.2, 1.5, 1.3, 17.6, and 0.8, respectively, in NHL patients.

Immunoglobulin transcript sequence and somatic hypermutation computation from unselected RNA-seq reads in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2015-03-18,"Immunoglobulins (Ig) are produced by B lymphocytes as secreted antibodies or as part of the B-cell receptor. There is tremendous diversity of potential Ig transcripts (>1 × 10(12)) as a result of hundreds of germ-line gene segments, random nucleotide incorporation during joining of gene segments into a complete transcript, and the process of somatic hypermutation at individual nucleotides. This recombination and mutation process takes place in the maturing B cell and is responsible for the diversity of potential epitope recognition. Cancers arising from mature B cells are characterized by clonal production of Ig heavy (IGH@) and light chain transcripts, although whether the sequence has undergone somatic hypermutation is dependent on the maturation stage at which the neoplastic clone arose. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in adults and arises from a mature B cell with either mutated or unmutated IGH@ transcripts, the latter having worse prognosis and the assessment of which is routinely performed in the clinic. Currently, IGHV mutation status is assessed by Sanger sequencing and comparing the transcript to known germ-line genes. In this paper, we demonstrate that complete IGH@ V-D-J sequences can be computed from unselected RNA-seq reads with results equal or superior to the clinical procedure: in the only discordant case, the clinical transcript was out-of-frame. Therefore, a single RNA-seq assay can simultaneously yield gene expression profile, SNP and mutation information, as well as IGHV mutation status, and may one day be performed as a general test to capture multidimensional clinically relevant data in CLL.

Granulomatous interstitial nephritis secondary to chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma.,Annals of diagnostic pathology,Ann Diagn Pathol,2015-03-06,"Granulomatous interstitial nephritis (GIN) is an uncommon pathologic lesion encountered in 0.5% to 5.9% of renal biopsies. Drugs, sarcoidosis, and infections are responsible for most cases of GIN. Malignancy is not an established cause of GIN. Here, we report a series of 5 patients with GIN secondary to chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). Patients were mostly elderly white males with an established history of CLL/SLL who presented with severe renal impairment (median peak serum creatinine, 7.3 mg/dL), leukocyturia, and mild proteinuria. One had nephromegaly. In 2 patients, the development and relapse of renal insufficiency closely paralleled the level of lymphocytosis. Kidney biopsy in all patients showed GIN concomitant with CLL/SLL leukemic interstitial infiltration. Granulomas were nonnecrotizing and epithelioid and were associated with giant cells. One biopsy showed granulomatous arteritis. One patient had a granulomatous reaction in lymph nodes and skin. Steroids with/without CLL/SLL-directed chemotherapy led to partial improvement of kidney function in all patients except 1 who had advanced cortical scarring on biopsy. In conclusion, we report an association between CLL/SLL and GIN.

Secondary mutations as mediators of resistance to targeted therapy in leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2015-03-20,"The advent of small molecule-based targeted therapy has improved the treatment of both acute and chronic leukemias. Resistance to small molecule inhibitors has emerged as a common theme. The most frequent mode of acquired resistance is the acquisition of point mutations in the kinase domain. FLT3 inhibitors have improved response rates in FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The occurrence of the ATP-binding site and activation loop mutations confers varying degrees of resistance to the individual FLT3 inhibitors. Second-generation FLT3 inhibitors such as crenolanib may overcome the resistance of these mutations. Furthermore, nonmutational mechanisms of resistance such as prosurvival pathways and bone marrow signaling may be upregulated in FLT3 inhibitor-resistant AML with secondary kinase domain mutations. More recently, point mutations conferring resistance to the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, arsenic trioxide in acute promyelocytic leukemia, and the BH3-mimetic ABT199 in lymphoma have been identified. In chronic myeloid leukemia, the emergence of tyrosine kinase domain mutations has historically been the dominant mechanism of resistance. The early identification of secondary point mutations and their downstream effects along with the development of second- or third-generation inhibitors and rationally designed small molecule combinations are potential strategies to overcome mutation-mediated resistance.

Idelalisib has shown efficacy in the relapsed setting and is currently approved by the FDA for use in combination with rituximab. Ibrutinib has been studied in patients with relapsed CLL and as frontline therapy. In the relapsed setting, these agents produce durable remissions, and might be preferable to re-treatment with chemoimmunotherapy for many patients. Ibrutinib is also effective treatment for patients with deletion 17p and is approved by the FDA as frontline therapy in this patient group, although it does not appear to completely abrogate this adverse prognostic factor. These agents have a unique side effect profile and longer follow-up is required to further understand tolerability and rare adverse effects. Obinutuzumab is a type-2 monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody which results in direct and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity of leukemia cells. It is approved by the FDA for use in combination with chlorambucil, and has shown efficacy in the frontline setting in patients unfit for more intensive chemoimmunotherapy. It produces increased response rates and minimal residual disease negativity compared with chlorambucil/rituximab and is associated with an advantage in progression-free survival but not yet overall survival. These agents underscore our advancement in the understanding of the biology of CLL and will improve outcomes for many patients with CLL.

Pharmacological and Protein Profiling Suggests Venetoclax (ABT-199) as Optimal Partner with Ibrutinib in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2015-03-31,"Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a critical enzyme in the B-cell receptor pathway and is inhibited by ibrutinib due to covalent binding to the kinase domain. Though ibrutinib results in impressive clinical activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), most patients achieve only partial remission due to residual disease. We performed a pharmacologic profiling of residual circulating CLL cells from patients receiving ibrutinib to identify optimal agents that could induce cell death of these lymphocytes. Ex vivo serial samples of CLL cells from patients on ibrutinib were obtained prior and after (weeks 2, 4, and 12) the start of treatment. These cells were incubated with PI3K inhibitors (idelalisib or IPI-145), bendamustine, additional ibrutinib, or BCL-2 antagonists (ABT-737 or ABT-199), and cell death was measured. In vitro investigations complemented ex vivo studies. Immunoblots for BTK signaling pathway and antiapoptotic proteins were performed. The BCL-2 antagonists, especially ABT-199, induced high cell death during ex vivo incubations. In concert with the ex vivo data, in vitro combinations also resulted in high cytotoxicity. Serial samples of CLL cells obtained before and 2, 4, 12, or 36 weeks after the start of ibrutinib showed inhibition of BTK activity and sensitivity to ABTs. Among the three BCL-2 family antiapoptotic proteins that are overexpressed in CLL, levels of MCL-1 and BCL-XL were decreased after ibrutinib while ABT-199 selectively antagonizes BCL-2.

Characterization of CLL exosomes reveals a distinct microRNA signature and enhanced secretion by activation of BCR signaling.,Blood,Blood,2015-04-01,"Multiple studies show that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells are heavily dependent on their microenvironment for survival. Communication between CLL cells and the microenvironment is mediated through direct cell contact, soluble factors, and extracellular vesicles. Exosomes are small particles enclosed with lipids, proteins, and small RNAs that can convey biological materials to surrounding cells. Our data herein demonstrate that CLL cells release significant amounts of exosomes in plasma that exhibit abundant CD37, CD9, and CD63 expression. Our work also pinpoints the regulation of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling in the release of CLL exosomes: BCR activation by α-immunoglobulin (Ig)M induces exosome secretion, whereas BCR inactivation via ibrutinib impedes α-IgM-stimulated exosome release. Moreover, analysis of serial plasma samples collected from CLL patients on an ibrutinib clinical trial revealed that exosome plasma concentration was significantly decreased following ibrutinib therapy. Furthermore, microRNA (miR) profiling of plasma-derived exosomes identified a distinct exosome microRNA signature, including miR-29 family, miR-150, miR-155, and miR-223 that have been associated with CLL disease. Interestingly, expression of exosome miR-150 and miR-155 increases with BCR activation. In all, this study successfully characterized CLL exosomes, demonstrated the control of BCR signaling in the release of CLL exosomes, and uncovered a disease-relevant exosome microRNA profile.

Selinexor is effective in acquired resistance to ibrutinib and synergizes with ibrutinib in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2015-04-02,"Despite the therapeutic efficacy of ibrutinib in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), complete responses are infrequent, and acquired resistance to Bruton agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibition is being observed in an increasing number of patients. Combination regimens that increase frequency of complete remissions, accelerate time to remission, and overcome single agent resistance are of considerable interest. We previously showed that the XPO1 inhibitor selinexor is proapoptotic in CLL cells and disrupts B-cell receptor signaling via BTK depletion. Herein we show the combination of selinexor and ibrutinib elicits a synergistic cytotoxic effect in primary CLL cells and increases overall survival compared with ibrutinib alone in a mouse model of CLL. Selinexor is effective in cells isolated from patients with prolonged lymphocytosis following ibrutinib therapy.

In Silico Modeling-based Identification of Glucose Transporter 4 (GLUT4)-selective Inhibitors for Cancer Therapy.,The Journal of biological chemistry,J. Biol. Chem.,2015-04-06,"Tumor cells rely on elevated glucose consumption and metabolism for survival and proliferation. Glucose transporters mediating glucose entry are key proximal rate-limiting checkpoints. Unlike GLUT1 that is highly expressed in cancer and more ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues, GLUT4 exhibits more limited normal expression profiles. We have previously determined that insulin-responsive GLUT4 is constitutively localized on the plasma membrane of myeloma cells. Consequently, suppression of GLUT4 or inhibition of glucose transport with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir elicited growth arrest and/or apoptosis in multiple myeloma. GLUT4 inhibition also caused sensitization to metformin in multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia and a number of solid tumors suggesting the broader therapeutic utility of targeting GLUT4. This study sought to identify selective inhibitors of GLUT4 to develop a more potent cancer chemotherapeutic with fewer potential off-target effects. Recently, the crystal structure of GLUT1 in an inward open conformation was reported. Although this is an important achievement, a full understanding of the structural biology of facilitative glucose transport remains elusive. To date, there is no three-dimensional structure for GLUT4. We have generated a homology model for GLUT4 that we utilized to screen for drug-like compounds from a library of 18 million compounds.

We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 72 patients (52 with CLL and 20 with RT) who underwent allogeneic SCT between 1998 and 2011 and had documented progression after transplantation. Twenty-two (31%) never had a response, and 50 (69%) had a response but experienced relapse after a median of 7 months (range, 2 to 85 months). Forty-eight patients who were receiving or were candidates to receive post-SCT cell-based therapies were not included in this analysis. The median age at time of transplantation was 58 years (range, 30 to 72 years). Sixty-two patients (86%) received more than two treatment regimens and 37 (51%) received more than three treatment regimens before SCT. Sixty-six patients (92%) had active disease at the time of transplantation. The 2- and 5-year survival rates were 67% and 38% (patients with CLL) and 36% and 0% (patients with RT). The patients who developed acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease had a longer overall survival (OS; P = .05). In a multivariable analysis, RT or low hemoglobin at the time of SCT predicted shorter OS. Chronic graft-versus-host disease and an initial response to SCT predicted longer OS.

Biomarkers Prev.,2015-05-11,"Excess adiposity has been associated with lymphomagenesis, possibly mediated by increased cytokine production causing a chronic inflammatory state. The relationship between obesity, cytokine polymorphisms, and selected mature B-cell neoplasms is reported. Data on 4,979 cases and 4,752 controls from nine American/European studies from the InterLymph consortium (1988-2008) were pooled. For diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), joint associations of body mass index (from self-reported height and weight) and 12 polymorphisms in cytokines IL1A (rs1800587), IL1B (rs16944, rs1143627), IL1RN (rs454078), IL2 (rs2069762), IL6 (rs1800795, rs1800797), IL10 (rs1800890, rs1800896), TNF (rs1800629), LTA (rs909253), and CARD15 (rs2066847) were investigated using unconditional logistic regression. BMI-polymorphism interaction effects were estimated using the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI). Obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) was associated with DLBCL risk [OR = 1.33; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.73], as was TNF-308GA+AA (OR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.07-1.44). Together, being obese and TNF-308GA+AA increased DLBCL risk almost 2-fold relative to those of normal weight and TNF-308GG (OR = 1.93; 95% CI, 1.27-2.94), with a RERI of 0.41 (95% CI, -0.05-0.84; Pinteraction = 0.13).

"Hypermorphic mutation of phospholipase C, γ2 acquired in ibrutinib-resistant CLL confers BTK independency upon B-cell receptor activation.",Blood,Blood,2015-05-13,"Ibrutinib has significantly improved the outcome of patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Recent reports attribute ibrutinib resistance to acquired mutations in Bruton agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase (BTK), the target of ibrutinib, as well as the immediate downstream effector phospholipase C, γ2 (PLCG2). Although the C481S mutation found in BTK has been shown to disable ibrutinib's capacity to irreversibly bind this primary target, the detailed mechanisms of mutations in PLCG2 have yet to be established. Herein, we characterize the enhanced signaling competence, BTK independence, and surface immunoglobulin dependence of the PLCG2 mutation at R665W, which has been documented in ibrutinib-resistant CLL. Our data demonstrate that this missense alteration elicits BTK-independent activation after B-cell receptor engagement, implying the formation of a novel BTK-bypass pathway. Consistent with previous results, PLCG2(R665W) confers hypermorphic induction of downstream signaling events. Our studies reveal that proximal kinases SYK and LYN are critical for the activation of mutant PLCG2 and that therapeutics targeting SYK and LYN can combat molecular resistance in cell line models and primary CLL cells from ibrutinib-resistant patients. Altogether, our results engender a molecular understanding of the identified aberration at PLCG2 and explore its functional dependency on BTK, SYK, and LYN, suggesting alternative strategies to combat acquired ibrutinib resistance.

The Cyclophilin A-CD147 complex promotes the proliferation and homing of multiple myeloma cells.,Nature medicine,Nat. Med.,2015-05-25,"B cell malignancies frequently colonize the bone marrow. The mechanisms responsible for this preferential homing are incompletely understood. Here we studied multiple myeloma (MM) as a model of a terminally differentiated B cell malignancy that selectively colonizes the bone marrow. We found that extracellular CyPA (eCyPA), secreted by bone marrow endothelial cells (BMECs), promoted the colonization and proliferation of MM cells in an in vivo scaffold system via binding to its receptor, CD147, on MM cells. The expression and secretion of eCyPA by BMECs was enhanced by BCL9, a Wnt-β-catenin transcriptional coactivator that is selectively expressed by these cells. eCyPA levels were higher in bone marrow serum than in peripheral blood in individuals with MM, and eCyPA-CD147 blockade suppressed MM colonization and tumor growth in the in vivo scaffold system. eCyPA also promoted the migration of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma cells, two other B cell malignancies that colonize the bone marrow and express CD147.

"Association of lymphoid malignancies and Philadelphia-chromosome negative myeloproliferative neoplasms: Clinical characteristics, therapy and outcome.",Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2015-05-12,"The co-occurrence of myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative neoplasms (MPN/LPN) has been reported, mostly in case reports. The aim of this study was to assess the characteristics and clinical course of the coexistent diseases. Among 9866 patients who presented to our institution from 1960 to 2014, 34 (0.3%) were diagnosed with MPN/LPN. LPN was diagnosed first in 16 patients, second in 15, and at the same time in 3. The time to secondary malignancy was longer when LPN was diagnosed first (119 vs 98 months). Myelofibrosis (41%), polycythemia vera (24%), and essential thrombocythemia (18%) were the most common MPNs, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (50%) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (32%) were the most common LPNs. Seventy-three percent of patients treated for MPN and 72% of those treated for LPN achieved a complete response. After a median follow-up from MPN diagnosis of 84 months, 16 patients are alive and 18 died (4 related to MPN and 2 LPN).

"Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis and early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia: diagnosis, natural history, and risk stratification.",Blood,Blood,2015-06-11,"Monoclonal B lymphocytosis (MBL) is defined as the presence of a clonal B-cell population in the peripheral blood with fewer than 5 × 10(9)/L B-cells and no other signs of a lymphoproliferative disorder. The majority of cases of MBL have the immunophenotype of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). MBL can be categorized as either low count or high count based on whether the B-cell count is above or below 0.5 × 10(9)/L. Low-count MBL can be detected in ∼5% of adults over the age of 40 years when assessed using standard-sensitivity flow cytometry assays. A number of biological and genetic characteristics distinguish low-count from high-count MBL. Whereas low-count MBL rarely progresses to CLL, high-count MBL progresses to CLL requiring therapy at a rate of 1% to 2% per year. High-count MBL is distinguished from Rai 0 CLL based on whether the B-cell count is above or below 5 × 10(9)/L. Although individuals with both high-count MBL and CLL Rai stage 0 are at increased risk of infections and second cancers, the risk of progression requiring treatment and the potential to shorten life expectancy are greater for CLL.

The most common findings on biopsy were: membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (n=10, 20%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia interstitial infiltration as primary etiology (n=6, 12%), thrombotic microangiopathy (n=6, 12%), and minimal change disease (n=5, 10%). All five membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis patients treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide and prednisone-based regimens had recovery of renal function compared to 0/3 patients treated with rituximab with or without steroids. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia infiltration as the primary cause of renal abnormalities was typically observed in relapsed/refractory patients (4/6). Thrombotic microangiopathy primarily occurred as a treatment-related toxicity of pentostatin (4/6 cases), and resolved with drug discontinuation.

Role of B cell receptor signaling in IL-10 production by normal and malignant B-1 cells.,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci.,2015-06-11,"B-1 cells are considered innate immune cells, which produce the majority of natural antibodies. B-1 cell responses to B cell receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptor ligation are tightly regulated owing to the cross-reactivity to self-antigens. CD5 has been shown to play a major role in downregulation of BCR responses in B-1 cells. Here, we provide evidence for another mechanism by which BCR response is regulated in B-1 cells. B-1 cells, as well as their malignant counterpart, B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells, produce interleukin-10 (IL-10) constitutively. IL-10 secretion by normal B-1 cells downregulates their proliferation responses to BCR ligation. However, we found that CLL cells appear to be unique in not responding to IL-10-mediated feedback-suppressive effects in comparison to normal B-1 cells.

CpG oligodeoxynucleotide CpG-685 upregulates functional interleukin-21 receptor on chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells through an NF-κB mediated pathway.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2015-06-01,"CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) upregulate the interleukin-21 receptor (IL21R) and enhance IL-21-mediated cytotoxicity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells. We demonstrate that treatment of CLL B cells with the ODN CpG-685 leads to increased IL21R expression, and that this increased expression enhances the effects of IL-21 treatment as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of JAK1, STAT1, and STAT3, as compared to IL-21 treatment without prior CpG stimulation. Induction of IL21R by CpG-685 also enhanced IL-21-mediated cytotoxicity. The mechanism by which CpG ODNs upregulate IL21R has not been elucidated, although IL21R regulation in T cells has been shown to be linked to T cell receptor-induced Sp1 binding to the IL21R promoter. Here, we demonstrate that luciferase reporter constructs containing the Sp1 binding site have increased basal luciferase activity compared to constructs lacking the Sp1 binding site, but fail to increase luciferase activity with CpG-685 stimulation in CLL B cells. By treating CLL cells with an NF-κB inhibitor, we inhibit the CpG ODN-mediated induction of IL21R, thus demonstrating that CpG-685 upregulates IL21R through an NF-κB mediated pathway.

Etiology of Ibrutinib Therapy Discontinuation and Outcomes in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.,JAMA oncology,JAMA Oncol,2015-04-01,"The Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib is effective in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Reasons for discontinuing therapy with this drug and outcomes following discontinuation have not been evaluated outside of clinical trials with relatively short follow-up. To determine features associated with discontinuation of ibrutinib therapy and outcomes. A total of 308 patients participating in 4 sequential trials of ibrutinib at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center were included. These clinical trials accrued patients included in this analysis from May 2010 until April 2014, and data were locked in June 2014. Patients were evaluated for time to therapy discontinuation, reasons for discontinuation, and survival following discontinuation. For patients who discontinued therapy because of disease progression, targeted deep sequencing was performed in samples at baseline and time of relapse. With a median follow-up of 20 months, 232 patients remained on therapy, 31 had discontinued because of disease progression, and 45 had discontinued for other reasons. Disease progression includes Richter's transformation (RT) or progressive CLL. Richter's transformation appeared to occur early and CLL progressions later (cumulative incidence at 12 months, 4.5% [95% CI, 2.0%-7.0%] and 0.3% [95% CI, 0%-1.0%], respectively). Median survival following RT was 3.5 months (95% CI, 0.3-6.0 months) and 17.6 months (95% CI, 4.7 months-""not reached"") following CLL progression. Sequencing on peripheral blood from 8 patients with RT revealed 2 with mutations in BTK, and a lymph node sample showed no mutations in BTK or PLCG2. Deep sequencing on 11 patients with CLL progression revealed BTK or PLCG2 mutations in all. These mutations were not identified before treatment in any patient.

Complex karyotype is a stronger predictor than del(17p) for an inferior outcome in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients treated with ibrutinib-based regimens.,Cancer,Cancer,2015-07-20,"Ibrutinib is active in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In patients treated with ibrutinib for R/R CLL, del(17p), identified by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), is associated with inferior progression-free survival despite equivalent initial response rates. Del(17p) is frequently associated with a complex metaphase karyotype (CKT); the prognostic significance of CKT in ibrutinib-treated patients has not been reported. This study reviewed 88 patients treated for R/R CLL at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center with investigational ibrutinib-based regimens from 2010 to 2013. Pretreatment FISH and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated metaphase cytogenetic analysis were performed on bone marrow. An adequate pretreatment metaphase karyotype was available for 56 of the 88 patients. The karyotype was complex in 21 of the 56 cases; 17 of the 21 had del(17p) according to FISH. The overall response rate, including partial remission with persistent lymphocytosis, was 94%; 18% had complete responses. In a multivariate analysis (MVA), only CKT was significantly associated with event-free survival (EFS; hazard ratio [HR], 6.6 [95% CI 1.7-25.6]; P = .006). Fludarabine-refractory CLL (HR, 6.9 [95% CI 1.8-27.1], P = .005) and CKT (HR 5.9 [95% CI 1.6-22.2], P = .008) were independently associated with inferior overall survival (OS) in MVA. Del(17p) by FISH was not significantly associated with EFS or OS in MVA. CKT is a powerful predictor of outcomes for ibrutinib-treated patients with R/R CLL and may be a stronger predictor of biological behavior than del(17p) by FISH.

Previous reports have suggested that in patients with relapsed CLL, a dose-intensified rituximab regimen increases response rates in comparison with standard-dose rituximab. It is unknown whether rituximab intensification of the FCR regimen will result in improved response rates and patient outcomes in patients with previously untreated CLL. A single-arm study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a modified FCR regimen with multiple-dose rituximab (FCR3) in 65 patients with previously untreated CLL. The results were compared with those for a historical cohort treated with FCR. The overall response rate to FCR3 was 97%, with 75% of the patients achieving a complete remission. Minimal residual disease negativity was achieved for 62% of the patients according to flow cytometry. The median time to progression (TTP) was 81 months, and the median overall survival (OS) was not reached, with 58% of the patients still alive at a median survivor follow-up of 9.7 years.

Epstein-Barr Virus MicroRNAs are Expressed in Patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Correlate with Overall Survival.,EBioMedicine,EBioMedicine,2015-04-29,"Although numerous studies highlighted the role of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) in B-cell transformation, the involvement of EBV proteins or genome in the development of the most frequent adult leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), has not yet been defined. We hypothesized that EBV microRNAs contribute to progression of CLL and demonstrated the presence of EBV miRNAs in B-cells, in paraffin-embedded bone marrow biopsies and in the plasma of patients with CLL by using three different methods (small RNA-sequencing, quantitative reverse transcription PCR [q-RT-PCR] and miRNAs in situ hybridization [miRNA-ISH]). We found that EBV miRNA BHRF1-1 expression levels were significantly higher in the plasma of patients with CLL compared with healthy individuals (p < 0 · 0001). Notably, BHRF1-1 as well as BART4 expression were detected in the plasma of either seronegative or seropositive (anti-EBNA-1 IgG and EBV DNA tested) patients; similarly, miRNA-ISH stained positive in bone marrow specimens while LMP1 and EBER immunohistochemistry failed to detect viral proteins and RNA. We also found that BHRF1-1 plasma expression levels were positively associated with elevated beta-2-microglobulin levels and advanced Rai stages and observed a correlation between higher BHRF1-1 expression levels and shorter survival in two independent patients' cohorts. Furthermore, in the majority of CLL cases where BHRF1-1 was exogenously induced in primary malignant B cells the levels of TP53 were reduced. Our findings suggest that EBV may have a role in the process of disease progression in CLL and that miRNA RT-PCR and miRNAs ISH could represent additional methods to detect EBV miRNAs in patients with CLL.

"Results of the Phase I Trial of RG7112, a Small-Molecule MDM2 Antagonist in Leukemia.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2015-10-12,"RG7112 is a small-molecule MDM2 antagonist. MDM2 is a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor p53 and frequently overexpressed in leukemias. Thus, a phase I study of RG7112 in patients with hematologic malignancies was conducted. Primary study objectives included determination of the dose and safety profile of RG7112. Secondary objectives included evaluation of pharmacokinetics; pharmacodynamics, such as TP53-mutation status and MDM2 expression; and preliminary clinical activity. Patients were divided into two cohorts: Stratum A [relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML; except acute promyelocytic leukemia), acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic myelogenous leukemia] and Stratum B (relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small cell lymphocytic leukemia; CLL/sCLL). Some Stratum A patients were treated at the MTD to assess clinical activity. RG7112 was administered to 116 patients (96 patients in Stratum A and 20 patients in Stratum B). All patients experienced at least 1 adverse event, and 3 dose-limiting toxicities were reported. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that twice-daily dosing enhanced daily exposure. Antileukemia activity was observed in the 30 patients with AML assessed at the MTD, including 5 patients who met International Working Group (IWG) criteria for response. Exploratory analysis revealed TP53 mutations in 14% of Stratum A patients and in 40% of Stratum B patients. Two patients with TP53 mutations exhibited clinical activity. p53 target genes were induced only in TP53 wild-type leukemic cells.

Analysis of Heritability and Shared Heritability Based on Genome-Wide Association Studies for Thirteen Cancer Types.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2015-10-12,"Studies of related individuals have consistently demonstrated notable familial aggregation of cancer. We aim to estimate the heritability and genetic correlation attributable to the additive effects of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for cancer at 13 anatomical sites. Between 2007 and 2014, the US National Cancer Institute has generated data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for 49 492 cancer case patients and 34 131 control patients. We apply novel mixed model methodology (GCTA) to this GWAS data to estimate the heritability of individual cancers, as well as the proportion of heritability attributable to cigarette smoking in smoking-related cancers, and the genetic correlation between pairs of cancers. GWAS heritability was statistically significant at nearly all sites, with the estimates of array-based heritability, hl (2), on the liability threshold (LT) scale ranging from 0.05 to 0.38. Estimating the combined heritability of multiple smoking characteristics, we calculate that at least 24% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 14% to 37%) and 7% (95% CI = 4% to 11%) of the heritability for lung and bladder cancer, respectively, can be attributed to genetic determinants of smoking. Most pairs of cancers studied did not show evidence of strong genetic correlation. We found only four pairs of cancers with marginally statistically significant correlations, specifically kidney and testes (ρ = 0.73, SE = 0.28), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and pediatric osteosarcoma (ρ = 0.53, SE = 0.21), DLBCL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (ρ = 0.51, SE =0.18), and bladder and lung (ρ = 0.35, SE = 0.14). Correlation analysis also indicates that the genetic architecture of lung cancer differs between a smoking population of European ancestry and a nonsmoking Asian population, allowing for the possibility that the genetic etiology for the same disease can vary by population and environmental exposures.

With other CD20 antibodies, a dose-response relationship has been shown. We therefore performed a randomized phase 2 study in symptomatic, untreated CLL patients to evaluate if an obinutuzumab dose response exists. Obinutuzumab was given at a dose of 1000 mg (100 mg IV day 1, 900 mg day 2, 1000 mg day 8 and day 15 of cycle 1; 1000 mg day 1 of cycles 2-8) or 2000 mg (100 mg IV day 1, 900 mg day 2, 1000 mg day 3, 2000 mg day 8 and day 15 of cycle 1; 2000 mg day 1 of cycles 2-8). The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR). Eighty patients were enrolled with similar demographics: median age 67 years, 41% high-risk Rai disease, and 10% del(17p)(13.1). ORR (67% vs 49%, P = .08) and complete response (CR) or CR with incomplete cytopenia response (20% vs 5%) favored 2000 mg obinutuzumab. Overall, therapy was well tolerated, and infusion events were manageable. This study demonstrates significant efficacy of obinutuzumab monotherapy, for 1000 mg as well as for 2000 mg, in untreated CLL patients with acceptable toxicity.

Outcomes of Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation for Lymphoma with Melphalan-Based Conditioning.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2015-10-20,"Haploidentical transplantation (Haplo-SCT) with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) is increasingly utilized for the treatment of lymphoma and almost exclusively with the nonmyeloablative fludarabine (Flu)/cyclophosphamide/total body irradiation (TBI) conditioning regimen. We present early results of a reduced-intensity (RIC) regimen utilizing fludarabine and melphalan (FM) for the treatment of advanced lymphoma. All patients with a diagnosis of lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who received Haplo-SCT at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center between 2009 and 2014 were reviewed (N = 22). Patients received Flu 160 mg/m(2) and melphalan 100 mg/m(2) to 140 mg/m(2) with thiotepa 5 mg/kg or 2 Gy TBI. Because of concerns of increased treatment-related mortality (TRM) with the melphalan 140 mg/m(2) regimen (FM140), a RIC regimen with melphalan 100 mg/m(2) (FM100) was devised. Rituximab was included for CD20(+) disease. Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis consisted of PTCy 50 mg/kg on days +3 and + 4, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. Sixty-eight percent of all patients were not in complete remission at the time of transplantation. The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort were 54%, 1-year TRM was 19%, and the cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years was 27%.

Eliminating minimal residual disease as a therapeutic end point: working toward cure for patients with CLL.,Blood,Blood,2015-11-17,"Deep remission and prolonged disease-free survival can be achieved with first-line chemoimmunotherapy (CIT), such as combined fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab, in the majority of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). More modest results are reported with less intense regimens like obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil. Clinical assessment has limited sensitivity in detecting residual disease responsible for subsequent relapse, even including morphologic bone marrow (BM) evaluation. Multicolor flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods can detect minimal residual disease (MRD) to a sensitivity of ≥1:10,000 (10(-4)). Achieving BM MRD-negative complete remission (CR) is associated with superior progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival; MRD status is the single best posttreatment predictor of long-term outcomes after CIT. Newer oral B-cell receptor signaling pathway inhibitors are highly effective at controlling disease, but best monotherapy responses are typically partial remission, and patients must remain on treatment to maintain disease control. Therapeutic progress is still needed for CLL. We propose that targeting MRD provides opportunity to realize this progress. Achieving BM MRD-negative CR is a prerequisite for long-term unmaintained disease-free survival and potential for cure. We review available methodologies for detecting MRD and correlations with posttreatment outcomes. We discuss the potential utility of MRD to direct individualized therapy.

β2 -microglobulin normalization within 6 months of ibrutinib-based treatment is associated with superior progression-free survival in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2015-11-20,"A high pretreatment β2 -microglobulin (B2M) level is associated with inferior survival outcomes in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, to the authors' knowledge, the prognostic and predictive significance of changes in B2M during treatment have not been reported to date. The authors analyzed 83 patients treated with ibrutinib-based regimens (66 with recurrent/refractory disease) and 198 treatment-naive patients who were treated with combined fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) to characterize changes in B2M and their relationship with clinical outcomes. B2M rapidly decreased during treatment with ibrutinib; on multivariable analysis, patients who received FCR (odds ratio, 0.40; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.18-0.90 [P = .027]) were less likely to have normalized B2M at 6 months than patients treated with ibrutinib. On univariable analysis, normalization of B2M was associated with superior progression-free survival (PFS) from the 6-month landmark in patients treated with ibrutinib-based regimens and FCR. On multivariable analysis, failure to achieve normalized B2M at 6 months of treatment was associated with inferior PFS (hazard ratio, 16.9; 95% CI, 1.3-220.0 [P = .031]) for patients treated with ibrutinib, after adjusting for the effects of baseline B2M, stage of disease, fludarabine-refractory disease, and del(17p).

Analysis of the Effects of the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) Inhibitor Ibrutinib on Monocyte Fcγ Receptor (FcγR) Function.,The Journal of biological chemistry,J. Biol. Chem.,2015-12-01,"The irreversible Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor ibrutinib has shown efficacy against B-cell tumors such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Fcγ receptors (FcγR) on immune cells such as macrophages play an important role in tumor-specific antibody-mediated immune responses, but many such responses involve Btk. Here we tested the effects of ibrutinib on FcγR-mediated activities in monocytes. We found that ibrutinib did not affect monocyte FcγR-mediated phagocytosis, even at concentrations higher than those achieved physiologically, but suppressed FcγR-mediated cytokine production. We confirmed these findings in macrophages from Xid mice in which Btk signaling is defective. Because calcium flux is a major event downstream of Btk, we tested whether it was involved in phagocytosis. The results showed that blocking intracellular calcium flux decreased FcγR-mediated cytokine production but not phagocytosis. To verify this, we measured activation of the GTPase Rac, which is responsible for actin polymerization. Results showed that ibrutinib did not inhibit Rac activation, nor did the calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester). We next asked whether the effect of ibrutinib on monocyte FcγR-mediated cytokine production could be rescued by IFNγ priming because NK cells produce IFNγ in response to antibody therapy. Pretreatment of monocytes with IFNγ abrogated the effects of ibrutinib on FcγR-mediated cytokine production, suggesting that IFNγ priming could overcome this Btk inhibition.

Targeting BCL2 with Venetoclax in Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2015-12-06,"New treatments have improved outcomes for patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but complete remissions remain uncommon. Venetoclax has a distinct mechanism of action; it targets BCL2, a protein central to the survival of CLL cells. We conducted a phase 1 dose-escalation study of daily oral venetoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) to assess safety, pharmacokinetic profile, and efficacy. In the dose-escalation phase, 56 patients received active treatment in one of eight dose groups that ranged from 150 to 1200 mg per day. In an expansion cohort, 60 additional patients were treated with a weekly stepwise ramp-up in doses as high as 400 mg per day. The majority of the study patients had received multiple previous treatments, and 89% had poor prognostic clinical or genetic features. Venetoclax was active at all dose levels. Clinical tumor lysis syndrome occurred in 3 of 56 patients in the dose-escalation cohort, with one death. After adjustments to the dose-escalation schedule, clinical tumor lysis syndrome did not occur in any of the 60 patients in the expansion cohort. Other toxic effects included mild diarrhea (in 52% of the patients), upper respiratory tract infection (in 48%), nausea (in 47%), and grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (in 41%). A maximum tolerated dose was not identified. Among the 116 patients who received venetoclax, 92 (79%) had a response. Response rates ranged from 71 to 79% among patients in subgroups with an adverse prognosis, including those with resistance to fludarabine, those with chromosome 17p deletions (deletion 17p CLL), and those with unmutated IGHV. Complete remissions occurred in 20% of the patients, including 5% who had no minimal residual disease on flow cytometry. The 15-month progression-free survival estimate for the 400-mg dose groups was 69%. Selective targeting of BCL2 with venetoclax had a manageable safety profile and induced substantial responses in patients with relapsed CLL or SLL, including those with poor prognostic features.

Acalabrutinib (ACP-196) in Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2015-12-07,"Irreversible inhibition of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) by ibrutinib represents an important therapeutic advance for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, ibrutinib also irreversibly inhibits alternative kinase targets, which potentially compromises its therapeutic index. Acalabrutinib (ACP-196) is a more selective, irreversible BTK inhibitor that is specifically designed to improve on the safety and efficacy of first-generation BTK inhibitors. In this uncontrolled, phase 1-2, multicenter study, we administered oral acalabrutinib to 61 patients who had relapsed CLL to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of acalabrutinib. Patients were treated with acalabrutinib at a dose of 100 to 400 mg once daily in the dose-escalation (phase 1) portion of the study and 100 mg twice daily in the expansion (phase 2) portion. The median age of the patients was 62 years, and patients had received a median of three previous therapies for CLL; 31% had chromosome 17p13.1 deletion, and 75% had unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable genes. No dose-limiting toxic effects occurred during the dose-escalation portion of the study. The most common adverse events observed were headache (in 43% of the patients), diarrhea (in 39%), and increased weight (in 26%). Most adverse events were of grade 1 or 2. At a median follow-up of 14.3 months, the overall response rate was 95%, including 85% with a partial response and 10% with a partial response with lymphocytosis; the remaining 5% of patients had stable disease. Among patients with chromosome 17p13.1 deletion, the overall response rate was 100%. No cases of Richter's transformation (CLL that has evolved into large-cell lymphoma) and only one case of CLL progression have occurred. In this study, the selective BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib had promising safety and efficacy profiles in patients with relapsed CLL, including those with chromosome 17p13.1 deletion.

A review of supportive care and recommended preventive approaches for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Expert review of hematology,Expert Rev Hematol,2016-02-24,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most prevalent type of adult leukemia encountered in the western world. Patients with CLL are typically older, with a median age in the 70s, and are at risk for certain complications due to the disease itself and due to the therapies imparted for this. Patients with CLL are at a higher risk of infections, partly due to disease and partly due to the immune dysfunction induced by treatment, such as purine analogous-based chemoimmunotherapy, which leads to lymphocyte depletion. Infections are a leading cause of complications and death in CLL patients. Also, CLL patients have been shown to have a higher incidence of other malignancies.

A phase II randomized trial comparing standard and low dose rituximab combined with alemtuzumab as initial treatment of progressive chronic lymphocytic leukemia in older patients: a trial of the ECOG-ACRIN cancer research group (E1908).,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2016-02-09,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) patients requiring initial therapy are often older and frailer and unsuitable candidates for standard chemoimmunotherapy regimens. Shorter duration combination monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy using alemtuzumab and rituximab has been shown to be effective and tolerable treatment for CLL. Standard dose anti-CD20 mAb therapy causes loss of CD20 expression by surviving CLL cells, which can be minimized by decreasing the mAb dose. We report a randomized phase II clinical trial enrolling older (≥ 65 years) patients (median age 76 years, n = 31) with treatment naïve progressive CLL. Patients received 8-12 weeks of standard subcutaneous alemtuzumab with either intravenous standard (375 mg/m(2) weekly)(n = 16) or low dose (20 mg/m(2) 3x week)(n = 15) rituximab. This study was closed before full accrual because the manufacturer withdrew alemtuzumab for treatment of CLL. The overall response rate was 90% with an 45% complete response rate, median progression-free survival of 17.9 months and no significant differences in outcome between the low and standard dose rituximab arms. The major toxicities were cytopenia and infection with one treatment fatality caused by progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy but no other opportunistic infections. Combination mAb therapy was effective and tolerable treatment for older and frailer patients with progressive CLL, achieving a high rate of complete remissions. These data support the role of mAb in therapy for less fit CLL patients and the further study of low dose higher frequency anti-CD20 mAb therapy as a potentially more effective use of anti-CD20 mAb in the treatment of CLL.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",1442.0,7.0,Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic CLL patients requiring initial therapy are often older and frailer and unsuitable candidates for standard chemoimmunotherapy regimens Shorter duration combination monoclonal antibody mAb therapy using alemtuzumab and rituximab has been shown to be effective and tolerable treatment for CLL Standard dose anti-CD20 mAb therapy causes loss of CD20 expression by surviving CLL cells which can be minimized by decreasing the mAb dose We report a randomized phase II clinical trial enrolling older ≥ 65 years patients median age 76 years n 31 with treatment naïve progressive CLL Patients received 8-12 weeks of standard subcutaneous alemtuzumab with either intravenous standard 375 mg/m 2 weekly n 16 or low dose 20 mg/m 2 3x week n 15 rituximab This study was closed before full accrual because the manufacturer withdrew alemtuzumab for treatment of CLL The overall response rate was 90 with an 45 complete response rate median progression-free survival of 17.9 months and no significant differences in outcome between the low and standard dose rituximab arms The major toxicities were cytopenia and infection with one treatment fatality caused by progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy but no other opportunistic infections Combination mAb therapy was effective and tolerable treatment for older and frailer patients with progressive CLL achieving a high rate of complete remissions These data support the role of mAb in therapy for less fit CLL patients and the further study of low dose higher frequency anti-CD20 mAb therapy as a potentially more effective use of anti-CD20 mAb in the treatment of CLL,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[442, 1193, 2647, 302, 1193, 552, 7, 1888, 388, 36, 32, 629, 434, 2, 29571, 2, 12277, 1931, 9, 260, 4438, 472, 985, 654, 150, 848, 548, 2780, 36, 75, 3579, 2, 855, 71, 85, 443, 6, 40, 323, 2, 2668, 24, 9, 552, 260, 61, 312, 2198, 2780, 36, 1626, 407, 1, 2198, 55, 20, 3050, 552, 37, 92, 122, 40, 9243, 20, 2777, 3, 2780, 61, 21, 414, 8, 384, 124, 215, 38, 160, 6280, 434, 749, 556, 60, 7, 52, 89, 846, 60, 78, 456, 5, 24, 2809, 1014, 552, 7, 103, 66, 133, 244, 1, 260, 2529, 3579, 5, 361, 1262, 260, 4175, 81, 188, 18, 709, 78, 245, 15, 154, 61, 179, 81, 188, 18, 22403, 647, 78, 167, 855, 26, 45, 10, 3745, 348, 1647, 2262, 408, 3, 18245, 7939, 3579, 9, 24, 1, 552, 3, 63, 51, 116, 10, 424, 5, 35, 512, 236, 51, 116, 52, 91, 115, 25, 1, 269, 83, 53, 2, 77, 93, 362, 4, 228, 59, 3, 154, 2, 260, 61, 855, 1335, 3, 458, 385, 11, 8165, 2, 930, 5, 104, 24, 18222, 1546, 20, 1014, 3492, 8744, 84, 77, 127, 10026, 1875, 150, 2780, 36, 10, 323, 2, 2668, 24, 9, 434, 2, 29571, 7, 5, 1014, 552, 1785, 8, 64, 116, 1, 236, 3166, 46, 74, 538, 3, 200, 1, 2780, 4, 36, 9, 299, 2975, 552, 7, 2, 3, 195, 45, 1, 154, 61, 142, 675, 312, 2198, 2780, 36, 22, 8, 751, 80, 323, 119, 1, 312, 2198, 2780, 4, 3, 24, 1, 552]",1653.0,26662208,238

Heightened BTK-dependent cell proliferation in unmutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia confers increased sensitivity to ibrutinib.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2016-01-01,"In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), patients with unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene (UM-CLL) have worse outcomes than mutated CLL (M-CLL) following chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy. However, in the era of BCR-targeted therapies, the adverse prognostic impact of unmutated IGHV seems to be diminishing, and there are clinical datasets showing unexpected improved responses in UM-CLL. We investigated the biological differences of BTK activity between these subgroups and further compared the impact of ibrutinib on molecular and cellular behaviors. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that phosphorylated active BTK is significantly higher in UM-CLL. Moreover, UM-CLL, compared to M-CLL, displayed a much higher proliferative capacity that was correlated with higher phospho-BTK and greater sensitivity to ibrutinib. In addition, BTK depletion with siRNA led to a more prominent reduction in the proliferation of UM-CLL, suggesting that elevated BTK activity is responsible for increased cell proliferation. Further, cell signaling activity by multiple measurements was consistently higher in UM-CLL accompanied by a higher sensitivity to ibrutinib. These studies link UM-CLL to elevated BCR signaling, heightened BTK-dependent cell proliferation and increased sensitivity to ibrutinib.

Ofatumumab and Lenalidomide for Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia: Correlation between Responses and Immune Characteristics.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2016-01-05,"We evaluated efficacy and tolerability of the combination of ofatumumab and lenalidomide in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and explored whether immune system characteristics could influence the response to treatment. Thirty-four patients were enrolled in this phase II study. Ofatumumab was administered at a dose of 300 mg on day 1, 1,000 mg on days 8, 15, and 22 during course 1, 1,000 mg on day 1 during courses 3-6, and once every other course during courses 7-24 (28-day courses). Oral lenalidomide (10 mg daily) was started on day 9 and continued for as long as a clinical benefit was observed. The overall response rate was 71%. Eight patients (24%) achieved a complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete recovery of blood counts, including 9% with minimal residual disease-negative CR. The median progression-free survival was 16 months, and the estimated 5-year survival was 53%. The most common treatment-related toxicity was neutropenia (grade >2 in 18% of the 574 patient courses). The most frequent infectious complications were pneumonia and neutropenic fever (24% and 9% of patients, respectively). We observed that patients who achieved a CR had at baseline higher numbers and a better preserved function of T cells and natural killer cells compared with non-responders.

DNA methylation dynamics during B cell maturation underlie a continuum of disease phenotypes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Nature genetics,Nat. Genet.,2016-01-18,"Charting differences between tumors and normal tissue is a mainstay of cancer research. However, clonal tumor expansion from complex normal tissue architectures potentially obscures cancer-specific events, including divergent epigenetic patterns. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of normal B cell subsets, we observed broad epigenetic programming of selective transcription factor binding sites coincident with the degree of B cell maturation. By comparing normal B cells to malignant B cells from 268 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we showed that tumors derive largely from a continuum of maturation states reflected in normal developmental stages. Epigenetic maturation in CLL was associated with an indolent gene expression pattern and increasingly favorable clinical outcomes. We further uncovered that most previously reported tumor-specific methylation events are normally present in non-malignant B cells. Instead, we identified a potential pathogenic role for transcription factor dysregulation in CLL, where excess programming by EGR and NFAT with reduced EBF and AP-1 programming imbalances the normal B cell epigenetic program.

Ibrutinib enhances chimeric antigen receptor T-cell engraftment and efficacy in leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2016-01-26,"Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is highly promising but requires robust T-cell expansion and engraftment. A T-cell defect in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) due to disease and/or therapy impairs ex vivo expansion and response to CAR T cells. To evaluate the effect of ibrutinib treatment on the T-cell compartment in CLL as it relates to CAR T-cell generation, we examined the phenotype and function of T cells in a cohort of CLL patients during their course of treatment with ibrutinib. We found that ≥5 cycles of ibrutinib therapy improved the expansion of CD19-directed CAR T cells (CTL019), in association with decreased expression of the immunosuppressive molecule programmed cell death 1 on T cells and of CD200 on B-CLL cells. In support of these findings, we observed that 3 CLL patients who had been treated with ibrutinib for ≥1 year at the time of T-cell collection had improved ex vivo and in vivo CTL019 expansion, which correlated positively together and with clinical response. Lastly, we show that ibrutinib exposure does not impair CAR T-cell function in vitro but does improve CAR T-cell engraftment, tumor clearance, and survival in human xenograft models of resistant acute lymphocytic leukemia and CLL when administered concurrently. Our collective findings indicate that ibrutinib enhances CAR T-cell function and suggest that clinical trials with combination therapy are warranted. Our studies demonstrate that improved T-cell function may also contribute to the efficacy of ibrutinib in CLL.

Prevalence and characteristics of central nervous system involvement by chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Haematologica,Haematologica,2016-01-27,"Abroad array of conditions can lead to neurological symptoms in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and distinguishing between clinically significant involvement of the central nervous system by chronic lymphocytic leukemia and symptoms due to other etiologies can be challenging. Between January 1999 and November 2014, 172 (4%) of the 4174 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia followed at our center had a magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system and/or a lumbar puncture to evaluate neurological symptoms. After comprehensive evaluation, the etiology of neurological symptoms was: central nervous system chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 18 patients (10% evaluated by imaging and/or lumbar puncture, 0.4% overall cohort); central nervous system Richter Syndrome in 15 (9% evaluated, 0.3% overall); infection in 40 (23% evaluated, 1% overall); autoimmune/inflammatory conditions in 28 (16% evaluated, 0.7% overall); other cancer in 8 (5% evaluated, 0.2% overall); and another etiology in 63 (37% evaluated, 1.5% overall). Although the sensitivity of cerebrospinal fluid analysis to detect central nervous system disease was 89%, the specificity was only 42% due to the frequent presence of leukemic cells in the cerebrospinal fluid in other conditions. No parameter on cerebrospinal fluid analysis (e.g. total nucleated cells, total lymphocyte count, chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell percentage) were able to offer a reliable discrimination between patients whose neurological symptoms were due to clinically significant central nervous system involvement by chronic lymphocytic leukemia and another etiology. Median overall survival among patients with clinically significant central nervous system chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Richter syndrome was 12 and 11 months, respectively. In conclusion, clinically significant central nervous system involvement by chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a rare condition, and neurological symptoms in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia are due to other etiologies in approximately 80% of cases.

In the majority of cases, CLL transforms into RS as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and a clonal relation between the two processes can be found. However, clonally unrelated RS can occur and transformations to other histologies beside DLBCL have been described. Recent data have shed some light on genetic characteristics that can influence and drive the transformation from CLL to RS. This molecular information has not been translated yet into significant treatment advances, and currently the therapy regimens for RS continue to rely on intensive chemotherapy combinations followed by stem cell transplant in suitable candidates. Based on the rapid pace of discoveries in the field of hematological malignancies and on the recent revolution in the therapeutic landscape for CLL and B cell lymphomas, new therapeutic options for RS might be available in the upcoming years.

Should IGHV status and FISH testing be performed in all CLL patients at diagnosis? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Blood,Blood,2016-02-03,"Since the first description of the natural history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) by David Galton in 1966, the considerable heterogeneity in the disease course has been well recognized. The Rai and Binet staging systems described ∼40 years ago have proven to be robust prognostic tools. Over the past 2 decades, several novel biological, genetic, and molecular markers have been shown to be useful adjuncts to the Rai and Binet staging systems. In this systematic review, we examined the role of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IGHV) mutation status and genetic abnormalities determined by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in patients with newly diagnosed CLL. The cumulative evidence presented in this systematic review is sufficient to recommend that FISH and IGHV be performed as standard clinical tests for all patients with newly diagnosed CLL in those countries with the resources to do so. In addition to clinical stage, these parameters could represent the minimal standard initial prognostic evaluation for patients with CLL.

NK Cell-Mediated Antitumor Effects of a Folate-Conjugated Immunoglobulin Are Enhanced by Cytokines.,Cancer immunology research,Cancer Immunol Res,2016-02-10,"Optimally effective antitumor therapies would not only activate immune effector cells but also engage them at the tumor. Folate conjugated to immunoglobulin (F-IgG) could direct innate immune cells with Fc receptors to folate receptor-expressing cancer cells. F-IgG bound to human KB and HeLa cells, as well as murine L1210JF, a folate receptor (FR)-overexpressing cancer cell line, as determined by flow cytometry. Recognition of F-IgG by natural killer (NK) cell Fc receptors led to phosphorylation of the ERK transcription factor and increased NK cell expression of CD69. Lysis of KB tumor cells by NK cells increased by about 5-fold after treatment with F-IgG, an effect synergistically enhanced by treatment with IL2, IL12, IL15, or IL21 (P< 0.001). F-IgG also enhanced the lysis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells by autologous NK cells. NK cells significantly increased production of IFNγ, MIP-1α, and RANTES in response to F-IgG-coated KB target cells in the presence of the NK cell-activating cytokine IL12, and these coculture supernatants induced significant T-cell chemotaxis (P< 0.001). F-IgG-coated targets also stimulated FcR-mediated monocyte effector functions. Studies in a murine leukemia model confirmed the intratumoral localization and antitumor activity of F-IgG, as well as enhancement of its effects by IL12 (P =0.05). The antitumor effect of this combination was dependent on NK cells and led to decreased tumor cell proliferation in vivo Thus, F-IgG can induce an immune response against FR-positive tumor cells that is mediated by NK cells and can be augmented by cytokine therapy.",Journal Article,1441.0,1.0,Optimally effective antitumor therapies would not only activate immune effector cells but also engage them at the tumor Folate conjugated to immunoglobulin F-IgG could direct innate immune cells with Fc receptors to folate receptor-expressing cancer cells F-IgG bound to human KB and HeLa cells as well as murine L1210JF a folate receptor FR -overexpressing cancer cell line as determined by flow cytometry Recognition of F-IgG by natural killer NK cell Fc receptors led to phosphorylation of the ERK transcription factor and increased NK cell expression of CD69 Lysis of KB tumor cells by NK cells increased by about 5-fold after treatment with F-IgG an effect synergistically enhanced by treatment with IL2 IL12 IL15 or IL21 P 0.001 F-IgG also enhanced the lysis of chronic lymphocytic cells by autologous NK cells NK cells significantly increased production of IFNγ MIP-1α and RANTES in response to F-IgG-coated KB target cells in the presence of the NK cell-activating cytokine IL12 and these coculture supernatants induced significant T-cell chemotaxis P 0.001 F-IgG-coated targets also stimulated FcR-mediated monocyte effector functions Studies in a murine model confirmed the intratumoral localization and antitumor activity of F-IgG as well as enhancement of its effects by IL12 P =0.05 The antitumor effect of this combination was dependent on NK cells and led to decreased tumor cell proliferation in vivo Thus F-IgG can induce an immune response against FR-positive tumor cells that is mediated by NK cells and can be augmented by cytokine therapy,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[5074, 323, 579, 235, 688, 44, 158, 2977, 250, 2070, 37, 84, 120, 7430, 1370, 28, 3, 30, 3100, 3868, 6, 2593, 1068, 3630, 359, 1196, 3939, 250, 37, 5, 4127, 1186, 6, 3100, 153, 1046, 12, 37, 1068, 3630, 2951, 6, 171, 5116, 2, 8466, 37, 22, 149, 22, 1471, 67622, 8, 3100, 153, 6413, 2810, 12, 31, 328, 22, 509, 20, 1412, 1914, 2335, 1, 1068, 3630, 20, 1504, 3458, 1765, 31, 4127, 1186, 836, 6, 982, 1, 3, 1819, 866, 161, 2, 101, 1765, 31, 55, 1, 16337, 4783, 1, 5116, 30, 37, 20, 1765, 37, 101, 20, 545, 33, 1116, 50, 24, 5, 1068, 3630, 35, 254, 4240, 651, 20, 24, 5, 6866, 17146, 16940, 15, 20661, 19, 13, 144, 1068, 3630, 120, 651, 3, 4783, 1, 442, 1193, 37, 20, 1028, 1765, 37, 1765, 37, 97, 101, 1529, 1, 6062, 7076, 3305, 2, 16222, 4, 51, 6, 1068, 3630, 8248, 5116, 283, 37, 4, 3, 463, 1, 3, 1765, 31, 1616, 1675, 17146, 2, 46, 7604, 12142, 277, 93, 102, 31, 12561, 19, 13, 144, 1068, 3630, 8248, 637, 120, 2816, 4953, 517, 5231, 2070, 1681, 94, 4, 8, 1471, 202, 557, 3, 2074, 2145, 2, 579, 128, 1, 1068, 3630, 22, 149, 22, 2461, 1, 211, 176, 20, 17146, 19, 13, 474, 3, 579, 254, 1, 26, 150, 10, 470, 23, 1765, 37, 2, 836, 6, 340, 30, 31, 457, 4, 386, 631, 1068, 3630, 122, 1290, 35, 250, 51, 480, 6413, 109, 30, 37, 17, 16, 517, 20, 1765, 37, 2, 122, 40, 4277, 20, 1675, 36]",1559.0,26865456,54

Genetically predicted longer telomere length is associated with increased risk of B-cell lymphoma subtypes.,Human molecular genetics,Hum. Mol. Genet.,2016-02-09,"Evidence from a small number of studies suggests that longer telomere length measured in peripheral leukocytes is associated with an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). However, these studies may be biased by reverse causation, confounded by unmeasured environmental exposures and might miss time points for which prospective telomere measurement would best reveal a relationship between telomere length and NHL risk. We performed an analysis of genetically inferred telomere length and NHL risk in a study of 10 102 NHL cases of the four most common B-cell histologic types and 9562 controls using a genetic risk score (GRS) comprising nine telomere length-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms. This approach uses existing genotype data and estimates telomere length by weighing the number of telomere length-associated variant alleles an individual carries with the published change in kb of telomere length. The analysis of the telomere length GRS resulted in an association between longer telomere length and increased NHL risk [four B-cell histologic types combined; odds ratio (OR) = 1.49, 95% CI 1.22-1.82,P-value = 8.5 × 10(-5)]. Subtype-specific analyses indicated that chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) was the principal NHL subtype contributing to this association (OR = 2.60, 95% CI 1.93-3.51,P-value = 4.0 × 10(-10)).

",Journal Article,1442.0,26.0,Evidence from a small number of studies suggests that longer telomere length measured in peripheral leukocytes is associated with an increased risk of NHL However these studies may be biased by reverse causation confounded by unmeasured environmental exposures and might miss time points for which prospective telomere measurement would best reveal a relationship between telomere length and NHL risk We performed an analysis of genetically inferred telomere length and NHL risk in a study of 10 102 NHL cases of the four most common B-cell histologic types and 9562 controls using a genetic risk score GRS comprising nine telomere length-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms This approach uses existing genotype data and estimates telomere length by weighing the number of telomere length-associated variant alleles an individual carries with the published change in kb of telomere length The analysis of the telomere length GRS resulted in an association between longer telomere length and increased NHL risk four B-cell histologic types combined odds ratio OR 1.49 95 CI 1.22-1.82 P-value 8.5 10 -5 Subtype-specific analyses indicated that chronic lymphocytic or small lymphocytic CLL/SLL was the principal NHL subtype contributing to this association OR 2.60 95 CI 1.93-3.51 P-value 4.0 10 -10 Significant interactions were observed across strata of sex for CLL/SLL and marginal zone subtypes as well as age for the follicular subtype Our results indicate that a genetic background that favors longer telomere length may increase NHL risk particularly risk of CLL/SLL and are consistent with earlier studies relating longer telomere length with increased NHL risk,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[241, 29, 8, 302, 207, 1, 94, 844, 17, 589, 4136, 1318, 644, 4, 672, 6884, 16, 41, 5, 35, 101, 43, 1, 1176, 137, 46, 94, 68, 40, 11627, 20, 1772, 16518, 8927, 20, 20325, 3766, 3401, 2, 822, 11070, 98, 862, 9, 92, 482, 4136, 2204, 688, 824, 2396, 8, 858, 59, 4136, 1318, 2, 1176, 43, 21, 173, 35, 65, 1, 2301, 13782, 4136, 1318, 2, 1176, 43, 4, 8, 45, 1, 79, 2867, 1176, 140, 1, 3, 294, 96, 186, 132, 31, 884, 630, 2, 67860, 535, 75, 8, 336, 43, 368, 14371, 3538, 762, 4136, 1318, 41, 226, 1579, 1203, 26, 353, 4025, 1692, 1183, 74, 2, 1423, 4136, 1318, 20, 14194, 3, 207, 1, 4136, 1318, 41, 1142, 2558, 35, 797, 4942, 5, 3, 983, 707, 4, 5116, 1, 4136, 1318, 3, 65, 1, 3, 4136, 1318, 14371, 627, 4, 35, 248, 59, 589, 4136, 1318, 2, 101, 1176, 43, 294, 132, 31, 884, 630, 397, 610, 197, 15, 14, 739, 48, 58, 14, 350, 14, 878, 19, 549, 66, 33, 79, 33, 875, 112, 318, 1103, 17, 442, 1193, 15, 302, 1193, 552, 5302, 10, 3, 4312, 1176, 875, 3156, 6, 26, 248, 15, 18, 335, 48, 58, 14, 966, 27, 725, 19, 549, 39, 13, 79, 79, 93, 1286, 11, 164, 716, 5758, 1, 1035, 9, 552, 5302, 2, 3450, 3614, 814, 22, 149, 22, 89, 9, 3, 1974, 875, 114, 99, 1008, 17, 8, 336, 2426, 17, 13054, 589, 4136, 1318, 68, 344, 1176, 43, 823, 43, 1, 552, 5302, 2, 32, 925, 5, 1677, 94, 7750, 589, 4136, 1318, 5, 101, 1176, 43]",1673.0,27008888,109
"Analysis of racial variations in disease characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2016-04-24,"The impact of race on outcomes of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common leukemia in the west, is not well studied. We aimed to understand racial variations in clinical and disease characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes in patients with CLL. We utilized the Mayo Clinic CLL database to perform an analysis of these characteristics and natural history of non-white (NW) compared to white (W) CLL patients. Differences by race in median overall survival (OS) and time-to-first-treatment (TTFT) were investigated. Of the 4215 CLL patients, 4114 (97.6%) were W and 101 (2.4%) were NW. NW patients were younger (median age at diagnosis 59.4 vs. 63.4; P = 0.003) and more likely to have an elevated LDH (28.0% vs. 16.2%; P = 0.02). No differences in prognostic parameters were noted. No major differences were observed in treatment selection. OS and TTFT were similar between both groups. In the largest analysis of NW-CLL patients in North America, and contrary to historical retrospective reports, W and NW patients appear to have comparable outcomes when treated similarly. These findings suggest previously noted outcome differences may be due to disparities in access to care and management rather than differences in disease biology. Am. J.

Carfilzomib Triggers Cell Death in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia by Inducing Proapoptotic and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Responses.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2016-03-29,"Carfilzomib, while active in B-cell neoplasms, displayed heterogeneous response in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) samples from patients and showed interpatient variability to carfilzomib-induced cell death. To understand this variability and predict patients who would respond to carfilzomib, we investigated the mechanism by which carfilzomib induces CLL cell death. Using CLL patient samples and cell lines, complementary knockdown and knockout cells, and carfilzomib-resistant cell lines, we evaluated changes in intracellular networks to identify molecules responsible for carfilzomib's cytotoxic activity. Lysates from carfilzomib-treated cells were immunoblotted for molecules involved in ubiquitin, apoptotic, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathways and results correlated with carfilzomib cytotoxic activity. Coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down assays were performed to identify complex interactions among MCL-1, Noxa, and Bak. Carfilzomib triggered ER stress and activation of both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways through alteration of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Consequently, the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homology protein (CHOP) accumulated in response to carfilzomib, and CHOP depletion conferred protection against cytotoxicity. Carfilzomib also induced accumulation of MCL-1 and Noxa, whereby MCL-1 preferentially formed a complex with Noxa and consequently relieved MCL-1's protective effect on sequestering Bak. Accordingly, depletion of Noxa or both Bak and Bax conferred protection against carfilzomib-induced cell death. Collectively, carfilzomib induced ER stress culminating in activation of intrinsic and extrinsic caspase pathways, and we identified the CHOP protein level as a biomarker that could predict sensitivity to carfilzomib in CLL.

Relationship of blood monocytes with chronic lymphocytic leukemia aggressiveness and outcomes: a multi-institutional study.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2016-04-24,"Monocyte-derived cells, constituents of the cancer microenvironment, support chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cell survival in vitro via direct cell-cell interaction and secreted factors. We hypothesized that circulating absolute monocyte count (AMC) reflects the monocyte-derived cells in the microenvironment, and that higher AMC is associated with increased CLL cell survival in vivo and thus inferior CLL patient outcomes. We assessed the extent to which AMC at diagnosis of CLL is correlated with clinical outcomes, and whether this information adds to currently used prognostic markers. We evaluated AMC, clinically used prognostic markers, and time to event data from 1,168 CLL patients followed at the Mayo Clinic, the Duke University Medical Center, and the Durham VA Medical Center. Elevated AMC was significantly associated with inferior clinical outcomes, including time to first therapy (TTT) and overall survival (OS). AMC combined with established clinical and molecular prognostic markers significantly improved risk-stratification of CLL patients for TTT. As an elevated AMC at diagnosis is associated with accelerated disease progression, and monocyte-derived cells in the CLL microenvironment promote CLL cell survival and proliferation, these findings suggest that monocytes and monocyte-derived cells are rational therapeutic targets in CLL.

Prognostic factors and risk stratification in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2016-02-08,"There is considerable heterogeneity in the clinical outcome of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). While some patients live for decades without any therapy, others die within years of diagnosis despite multiple treatments. To better counsel newly diagnosed CLL patients about their disease course, the Rai and Binet staging systems were developed four decades ago. A deeper understanding of the biologic and molecular aberrations contributing to the pathogenesis of CLL led to identification of novel prognostic markers such as immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable gene (IGHV) mutation status, leukemia-cell expression of CD38, ZAP-70, and CD49d, and cytogenetic abnormalities detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The advent of next-generation sequencing has provided unprecedented insights into the subclonal architecture of CLL and its impact on disease progression and survival.

Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2016-02-08,"In the last 10 years, oncology has been transformed by the development and broad availability of small molecule therapies for cancer. Compounds have been and are being developed to target nearly every known relevant component of the cell's machinery. One class of compounds, the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, was originally conceived as an anticancer therapeutic based on the premise that as cancer is (in part) defined by loss of cell-cycle control, the interruption of cell cycle could arrest cancer growth. While CDKs do play critical roles in cell cycle, including in cancer, the study of CDK inhibitors in the relatively non-proliferative disease chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) revealed alternate mechanisms both for CDKs, as well as for the role of CDK inhibitors in cancer therapy. In this review, we will consider three CDK inhibitors: alvocidib (flavopiridol), dinaciclib, and TG02.

Exploring this phenomenon, we found overexpression of caspase-3, higher cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase levels (p < 0.007), and a higher apoptosis rate in cells from patients with high counts compared with cells from patients with low counts. Although we previously found that STAT3 protects CLL cells from apoptosis, STAT3 levels were significantly higher in cells from patients with high counts than in cells from patients with low counts. Furthermore, overexpression of STAT3 did not protect the cells. Rather, it upregulated caspase-3 and induced apoptosis. Remarkably, putative STAT3 binding sites were identified in the caspase-3 promoter, and a luciferase assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and an EMSA revealed that STAT3 activated caspase-3 However, caspase-3 levels increased only when STAT3 levels were sufficiently high.

Hsp90 inhibition increases SOCS3 transcript and regulates migration and cell death in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2016-05-01,"Epigenetic or transcriptional silencing of important tumor suppressors has been described to contribute to cell survival and tumorigenesis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Using gene expression microarray analysis, we found that thousands of genes are repressed more than 2-fold in CLL compared to normal B cells; however therapeutic approaches to reverse this have been limited in CLL. Following treatment with the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-DMAG, a significant number of these repressed genes were significantly re-expressed. One of the genes significantly repressed in CLL and up-regulated by 17-DMAG was suppressor of cytokine signaling 3, (SOCS3). SOCS3 has been shown to be silenced in solid tumors as well as myeloid leukemia; however little is known about the regulation in CLL. We found that 17-DMAG induces expression of SOCS3 by via the activation of p38 signaling, and subsequently inhibits AKT and STAT3 phosphorylation resulting in downstream effects on cell migration and survival. We therefore suggest that SOCS3 is an important signaling protein in CLL, and Hsp90 inhibitors represent a novel approach to target transcriptional repression in B cell lymphoproliferative disorders which exhibit a substantial degree of gene repression.

Of the patients, 22 % improved their response from a PR to CR. Eighty-eight percent experienced a reduction in tumor burden as measured by extent of bone marrow involvement including patients with del17p and complex karyotype.

Cytomegalovirus infection does not impact on survival or time to first treatment in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2016-06-01,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a widely prevalent herpes virus which establishes a state of chronic infection. The establishment of CMV-specific immunity controls viral reactivation and leads to the accumulation of very large numbers of virus-specific T cells which come to dominate the immune repertoire. There is concern that this may reduce the immune response to heterologous infections and HCMV infection has been associated with reduced survival in elderly people. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) suffer from a state of immune suppression but have a paradoxical increase in the magnitude of the CMV-specific T cell and humoral immune response. As such, there is now considerable interest in how CMV infection impacts on the clinical outcome of patients with B-CLL. Utilizing a large prospective cohort of patients with B-CLL (n = 347) we evaluated the relationship between HCMV seropositivity and patient outcome. HCMV seropositive patients had significantly worse overall survival than HCMV negative patients in univariate analysis (HR = 2.28, 95% CI: 1.34-3.88; P = 0.002). However, CMV seropositive patients were 4 years older than seronegative donors and this survival difference was lost in multivariate modeling adjusted for age and other validated prognostic markers (P = 0.34).

"Venetoclax in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with 17p deletion: a multicentre, open-label, phase 2 study.",The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2016-05-10,"Deletion of chromosome 17p (del[17p]) in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia confers very poor prognosis when treated with standard chemo-immunotherapy. Venetoclax is an oral small-molecule BCL2 inhibitor that induces chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cell apoptosis. In a previous first-in-human study of venetoclax, 77% of patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia achieved an overall response. Here we aimed to assess the activity and safety of venetoclax monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory del(17p) chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. In this phase 2, single-arm, multicentre study, we recruited patients aged 18 years and older with del(17p) relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (as defined by 2008 Modified International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia guidelines) from 31 centres in the USA, Canada, UK, Germany, Poland, and Australia. Patients started once daily venetoclax with a weekly dose ramp-up schedule (20, 50, 100, 200, 400 mg) over 4-5 weeks. Patients were then given daily 400 mg continuous dosing until disease progression or discontinuation for another reason. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving an overall response, assessed by an independent review committee. Activity and safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug (per protocol). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01889186. Follow-up is ongoing, and patients are still receiving treatment. Between May 27, 2013, and June 27, 2014, 107 patients were enrolled into the study. At a median follow-up of 12·1 months (IQR 10·1-14·2), an overall response by independent review was achieved in 85 (79·4%; 95% CI 70·5-86·6) of 107 patients. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (43 [40%]), infection (21 [20%]), anaemia (19 [18%]), and thrombocytopenia (16 [15%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 59 (55%) patients, irrespective of their relationship to treatment, with the most common (≥5% of patients) being pyrexia and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (seven [7%] each), pneumonia (six [6%]), and febrile neutropenia (five [5%]). 11 patients died in the study within 30 days of the last dose of venetoclax; seven due to disease progression and four from an adverse event (none assessed as treatment related). Results of this trial show that venetoclax monotherapy is active and well tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory del(17p) chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, providing a new therapeutic option for this very poor prognosis population. Additionally, in view of the distinct mechanism-of-action of venetoclax, combinations or sequencing with other novel targeted agents should be investigated to further advance treatment of del(17p) chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

Outcomes of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with first-line idelalisib plus rituximab after cessation of treatment for toxicity.,Cancer,Cancer,2016-05-16,"More active therapies are needed for older and unfit patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who are not eligible for chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. The phosphyotidylinositol-3-kinase δ inhibitor idelalisib is effective in patients with treatment-naive and relapsed/refractory CLL as monotherapy and in combination with rituximab, but it can be associated with treatment-limiting adverse events, particularly diarrhea/colitis. The outcomes for patients who cease treatment for adverse events have not been previously described. The authors analyzed long-term follow-up data from 40 treatment-naïve patients aged ≥65 years who received treatment at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center on a phase 2 study of idelalisib plus rituximab for CLL. In patients who permanently ceased treatment because of toxicity, the time to subsequent disease progression was analyzed according to baseline characteristics. Fifteen patients permanently ceased therapy (PCT) because of toxicity (PCTTOX ), most commonly diarrhea/colitis (n = 7), at a median of 11 months after commencing treatment. PCTTOX was associated with a higher risk of subsequent disease progression (hazard ratio, 6.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.77-16.15) relative to that observed in patients who remained on therapy. Ten patients subsequently progressed, and 7 required salvage therapy; 5 patients remained progression-free at a median of 23.3 months (range, 8.5-28.6 months). Patients who were positive for ζ-associated protein-70 had more rapid disease progression after treatment cessation (P = .048). There were no CLL-related deaths. PCTTOX is the major determinant of PFS in patients who receive first-line idelalisib-based treatment. However, a subgroup of patients with favorable biologic characteristics has prolonged PFS, even after PCTTOX . The absence of CLL-related deaths indicates that salvage treatment is generally successful after PCTTOX .

Tris (dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium: a small-molecule palladium complex is effective in inducing apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia B-cells.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2016-05-17,"Here we tested impact of Tris (dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium (Tris-DBA) on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B-cell survival. Indeed, treatment of CLL B-cells with Tris-DBA induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner irrespective of IgVH mutational status. Further analyses suggest that Tris-DBA-induced apoptosis involves reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL, and XIAP with an upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein BIM in CLL B-cells. Our findings also indicate that Tris-DBA targets the ribosomal protein (rp)-S6, an essential component of the Akt/mTOR signaling axis in CLL B-cells.

Reactivation of Smac-mediated apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells: mechanistic studies of Smac mimetic.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2016-06-01,"Dysfunctional apoptotic machinery is a hallmark feature of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Accordingly, targeting apoptosis regulators has been proven a rational approach for CLL treatment. We show that CLL lymphocytes express high levels of XIAP, cIAP1, and cIAP2 compared to normal lymphocytes. Smac mimetic, Smac066, designed to bind to BIR3-domain of IAPs, induce apoptosis in primary CLL cells (n=71; p<0.0001), irrespective of prognostic markers. Apoptosis was mediated by diminished levels of IAPs (XIAP-p=0.02; cIAP-p<0.0001) and increased activation of caspases-8,-9,-3. The caspase-cleavage was in direct association with the levels of apoptosis (r2=0.8 for caspases-8,-9,-3). Correlative analysis revealed a direct relationship between reduction in IAPs and degree of apoptosis (r2=0.6 (XIAP); 0.5 (cIAP2)). There was a strong association between apoptosis, IAP-degradation, and concurrent caspase-activation. Pan-caspase inhibitor Z-Vad-fmk reversed the degradation of Mcl-1, but not IAPs suggesting that smac066 is selective to IAPs, however, Mcl-1 degradation is through caspase-mediated cleavage. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed physical interaction between caspase-3 and XIAP that was disrupted by smac066. Importantly, XIAP and cIAP2 were markedly induced in bone-marrow and lymph-node microenvironments, providing a basis for IAP antagonists as anti-tumor agents in CLL.

Reprogramming Nurse-like Cells with Interferon γ to Interrupt Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Cell Survival.,The Journal of biological chemistry,J. Biol. Chem.,2016-05-13,"Nurse-like cells (NLCs) play a central role in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) because they promote the survival and proliferation of CLL cells. NLCs are derived from the monocyte lineage and are driven toward their phenotype via contact-dependent and -independent signals from CLL cells. Because of the central role of NLCs in promoting disease, new strategies to eliminate or reprogram them are needed. Successful reprogramming may be of extra benefit because NLCs express Fcγ receptors (FcγRs) and thus could act as effector cells within the context of antibody therapy. IFNγ is known to promote the polarization of macrophages toward an M1-like state that is no longer tumor-supportive. In an effort to reprogram the phenotype of NLCs, we found that IFNγ up-regulated the M1-related markers CD86 and HLA-DR as well as FcγRIa. This corresponded to enhanced FcγR-mediated cytokine production as well as rituximab-mediated phagocytosis of CLL cells. In addition, IFNγ down-regulated the expression of CD31, resulting in withdrawal of the survival advantage on CLL cells. These results suggest that IFNγ can re-educate NLCs and shift them toward an effector-like state and that therapies promoting local IFNγ production may be effective adjuvants for antibody therapy in CLL.",Journal Article,1348.0,6.0,Nurse-like cells NLCs play a central role in chronic lymphocytic CLL because they promote the survival and proliferation of CLL cells NLCs are derived from the monocyte lineage and are driven toward their phenotype via contact-dependent and -independent signals from CLL cells Because of the central role of NLCs in promoting disease new strategies to eliminate or reprogram them are needed Successful reprogramming may be of extra benefit because NLCs express Fcγ receptors FcγRs and thus could act as effector cells within the context of antibody therapy IFNγ is known to promote the polarization of macrophages toward an M1-like state that is no longer tumor-supportive In an effort to reprogram the phenotype of NLCs we found that IFNγ up-regulated the M1-related markers CD86 and HLA-DR as well as FcγRIa This corresponded to enhanced FcγR-mediated cytokine production as well as rituximab-mediated phagocytosis of CLL cells In addition IFNγ down-regulated the expression of CD31 resulting in withdrawal of the survival advantage on CLL cells These results suggest that IFNγ can re-educate NLCs and shift them toward an effector-like state and that therapies promoting local IFNγ production may be effective adjuvants for antibody therapy in CLL,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[6756, 733, 37, 17425, 1343, 8, 854, 200, 4, 442, 1193, 552, 408, 491, 1617, 3, 25, 2, 457, 1, 552, 37, 17425, 32, 526, 29, 3, 5231, 2542, 2, 32, 1621, 1317, 136, 1005, 847, 4393, 470, 2, 306, 2312, 29, 552, 37, 408, 1, 3, 854, 200, 1, 17425, 4, 2388, 34, 217, 422, 6, 4964, 15, 14947, 1370, 32, 575, 1401, 7394, 68, 40, 1, 3420, 247, 408, 17425, 1669, 19247, 1186, 29802, 2, 631, 359, 2559, 22, 2070, 37, 262, 3, 1533, 1, 548, 36, 6062, 16, 440, 6, 1617, 3, 9207, 1, 2748, 1317, 35, 4445, 733, 1309, 17, 16, 77, 589, 30, 1877, 4, 35, 2919, 6, 14947, 3, 1005, 1, 17425, 21, 204, 17, 6062, 126, 1065, 3, 4445, 139, 525, 12514, 2, 1160, 3436, 22, 149, 22, 68269, 26, 7254, 6, 651, 16125, 517, 1675, 1529, 22, 149, 22, 855, 517, 11788, 1, 552, 37, 4, 352, 6062, 1328, 1065, 3, 55, 1, 6019, 1113, 4, 3683, 1, 3, 25, 1874, 23, 552, 37, 46, 99, 309, 17, 6062, 122, 1491, 10407, 17425, 2, 3024, 1370, 1317, 35, 2070, 733, 1309, 2, 17, 235, 2388, 293, 6062, 1529, 68, 40, 323, 8654, 9, 548, 36, 4, 552]",1250.0,27226587,545
Idelalisib given front-line for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia causes frequent immune-mediated hepatotoxicity.,Blood,Blood,2016-05-31,"Idelalisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of PI3Kδ with demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To evaluate idelalisib as front-line therapy, we enrolled 24 subjects in a phase 2 study consisting of 2 months of idelalisib monotherapy followed by 6 months of combination therapy with idelalisib and the anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab. After a median follow-up period of 14.7 months, hepatotoxicity was found to be a frequent and often severe adverse event. A total of 19 subjects (79%) experienced either grade ≥1 ALT or AST elevation during the study, and 13 subjects (54%) experienced grade ≥3 transaminitis. The median time to development of transaminitis was 28 days, occurring before ofatumumab introduction. Younger age and mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain status were significant risk factors for the development of hepatotoxicity. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that this hepatotoxicity was immune mediated. A lymphocytic infiltrate was seen on liver biopsy specimens taken from 2 subjects with transaminitis, and levels of the proinflammatory cytokines CCL-3 and CCL-4 were higher in subjects experiencing hepatotoxicity. All cases of transaminitis resolved either by holding the drug, initiating immunosuppressants, or both, and rates of recurrent toxicity were lower in patients taking steroids when idelalisib was reinitiated. A decrease in peripheral blood regulatory T cells was seen in patients experiencing toxicity on therapy, which is consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism.

Results of a phase II study of lenalidomide and rituximab for refractory/relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2016-05-17,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an incurable disease in need of new therapeutic strategies. The immunomodulatory agent, lenalidomide, has shown activity as salvage therapy for CLL. In this phase II trial, we combined lenalidomide with rituximab in 25 patients (range, 41-79) with refractory/relapsed CLL. Lenalidomide was administered orally on escalating doses, with cycle 1 doses of 2.5mg daily on days 1-7, 5mg on days 8-14, and 10mg on days 15-21 followed by 7days off. On cycle 2 and beyond, lenalidomide was administered at 20mg daily on days 1-21. Rituximab was administered at 375mg/m(2) intravenously on a weekly basis for the first cycle starting on day 15 for 4 doses, with each cycle being 28days. Treatment was continued until disease progression or toxicity. Overall response rate was 45.8% on intent-to-treat and 61.1% in evaluable patients (all partial responses).

Lenalidomide Induces Interleukin-21 Production by T Cells and Enhances IL21-Mediated Cytotoxicity in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia B Cells.,Cancer immunology research,Cancer Immunol Res,2016-06-10,"The immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide has demonstrated efficacy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), despite a lack of direct cytotoxic effects in vitro The mechanism of lenalidomide efficacy in vivo is thought to occur via a combination of enhanced immune activity and an alteration of tumor cell-microenvironment interactions. We demonstrate in whole blood from patients with CLL that lenalidomide significantly depletes malignant B cells. Lenalidomide also induced production of interleukin-21 (IL21) and its mRNA in T cells from patients with CLL. In addition, lenalidomide enhanced upregulation of functional IL21 receptor (IL21R) on the cell surface and increased receptor mRNA in vitro The in vitro combination of IL21 and lenalidomide enhanced IL21-mediated cytotoxicity toward CLL cells through a variety of mechanisms. We show association of cell death with upregulation of Bid by IL21, enhanced upregulation of Bid by the combination therapy, and diminished Lck and downstream BCR signaling activation of Syk and PLCG2. Collectively, we demonstrated an immune cell-tumor cell interaction through lenalidomide-mediated induction of IL21 and IL21R, with enhanced IL21-mediated cytotoxicity, which provides justification for this combination in clinical trials for patients with CLL.

Richter transformation of CLL.,Expert review of hematology,Expert Rev Hematol,2016-06-28,"Richter transformation (RT) represents an aggressive transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), most commonly into diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). It occurs in around 5% of patients with CLL. This review will focus on the biology and treatment of RT. We also address the management of RT in the era of targeted therapies. Based on clonal relationship of large cell component to CLL, 2 distinct subtypes could be identified: clonally-related RT which carries a worse outcome, and clonally-unrelated RT where the outcomes are similar to de novo DLBCL. Aberrations of TP53, CDKN2A, MYC, and NOTCH1 are common in RT, many of which are acquired at the time of transformation. PET scan remains the imaging modality of choice for patients with suspected RT. It is important to perform a biopsy rather than fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the suspicious lesions, as FNA can lead to false negative results. Chemoimmunotherapy remains the treatment of choice, though the outcomes remain suboptimal. The median survival is less than 1 year. Novel therapies are needed for patients with RT.

Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and acute renal failure in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Response to obinutuzumab.,Hematology/oncology and stem cell therapy,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther,2016-06-23,"Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is a common extramedullary renal presentation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and can present with either a frank renal failure or proteinuria. One of its etiologies has been attributed to a paraneoplastic, immune complex phenomenon occurring in CLL. Although there is no standard of care in such patients, use of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies like rituximab have been used before in such patients with variable responses. Obinutuzumab is a novel, type II, immunoglobulin-G1 monoclonal antibody with a higher efficacy than rituximab and has an established safely profile in patients with comorbidities and poor renal functions. There are no such reported cases of MPGN in CLL being treated with obinutuzumab. We used the standard doses of obinutuzumab in our elderly patient (78-year-old woman) with high-risk CLL due to an underlying TP53 mutation, along with a MPGN-related acute renal failure. The patient achieved complete remission after six cycles of obinutuzumab; however, she remained positive for minimal residual disease on flow cytometry. Her renal function improved completely, suggesting a complete response of her underlying MPGN. Obinutuzumab has an established safety profile in patients with CLL, but our case is the first reported case of a paraneoplastic, immune complex-mediated MPGN in CLL being treated with obinutuzumab.

Tumor reactivity can be encoded genetically by introducing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) into T cells. CARs are composed of an antigen-binding domain and an intracellular T cell activation domain. Early human trials evaluating CD19-targeted CAR T cells for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) showed limited responses until CARs included a costimulation domain, and conditioning chemotherapy was given before T cell infusion. Clinical trials evaluating CD19-targeted CAR T cells for B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) are demonstrating response rates up to 90%. However, these clinical outcomes are associated with a cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is caused by T cell activation and manifests as high-grade fever, hypotension, and other cardiovascular complications. It is currently managed conservatively but can be treated with cytokine-directed therapy or with high-dose steroids.

At later doses, these values were higher for patients with complete response (CR) than for other patients. Higher C<sub>max</sub> and C<sub>trough</sub> values at Cycles 3 and 6 were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of CR, whereas ofatumumab pharmacokinetics were not associated with an objective response (OR) on the basis of univariate analyses.

The chronic lymphocytic leukemia international prognostic index predicts time to first treatment in early CLL: Independent validation in a prospective cohort of early stage patients.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2016-08-08,"The chronic lymphocytic leukemia International Prognostic Index (CLL-IPI) combines 5 parameters (age, clinical stage, TP53 status [normal vs. del(17p) and/or TP53 mutation], IGHV mutational status, serum β2-microglobulin) to predict survival and time-to-first-treatment (TTFT) in CLL patients. We performed an observational study in 337 prospectively collected, Binet stage A patients to validate the ability of the CLL-IPI to predict TTFT in an independent cohort of early stage CLL patients. The CLL-IPI score stratified Binet stage A patients into three subgroups with different outcome. Since the CLL-IPI was originally developed to predict survival, we next investigated the optimal cut-off score to predict TTFT in Binet stage A patients. Recursive partitioning analysis identified three subsets with scores of 0 (n = 139), 1 (n = 90), and ≥ 2(n = 108). The probability of remaining free from therapy 5 years after diagnosis was 85%, 67% and 46% in these three categories (P < 0.0001.; C-statistic:c = 0.72; 95% CI:0.58-0.81). This optimized CLL-IPI scoring for TTFT was subsequently validated in an independent cohort of Binet A patients from the Mayo Clinic (n = 525). The ability of either original or optimized CLL-IPI to predict TTFT was equivalent to other prognostic models specifically designed for this endpoint (2011 MDACC score and O-CLL1 score). Although originally developed to predict suvival, the CLL-IPI is useful for predicting TTFT in early stage CLL patients. Am. J.

Functional Differences between IgM and IgD Signaling in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",J. Immunol.,2016-08-17,"BCR signaling is a central pathogenetic pathway in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Most CLL cells express BCRs of IgM and IgD isotypes, but the contribution of these isotypes to functional responses remains incompletely defined. We therefore investigated differences between IgM and IgD signaling in freshly isolated peripheral blood CLL cells and in CLL cells cultured with nurselike cells, a model that mimics the lymph node microenvironment. IgM signaling induced prolonged activation of ERK kinases and promoted CLL cell survival, CCL3 and CCL4 chemokine secretion, and downregulation of BCL6, the transcriptional repressor of CCL3 In contrast, IgD signaling induced activation of the cytoskeletal protein HS1, along with F-actin polymerization, which resulted in rapid receptor internalization and failure to support downstream responses, including CLL cell survival and chemokine secretion. IgM and IgD receptor downmodulation, HS1 and ERK activation, chemokine secretion, and BCL6 downregulation were also observed when CLL cells were cocultured with nurselike cells. The Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib effectively inhibited both IgM and IgD isotype signaling. In conclusion, through a variety of functional readouts, we demonstrate very distinct outcomes of IgM and IgD isotype activation in CLL cells, providing novel insight into the regulation of BCR signaling in CLL.",Journal Article,1252.0,13.0,BCR signaling is a central pathogenetic pathway in chronic lymphocytic CLL Most CLL cells express BCRs of IgM and IgD isotypes but the contribution of these isotypes to functional responses remains incompletely defined We therefore investigated differences between IgM and IgD signaling in freshly isolated peripheral blood CLL cells and in CLL cells cultured with nurselike cells a model that mimics the lymph node microenvironment IgM signaling induced prolonged activation of ERK kinases and promoted CLL cell survival CCL3 and CCL4 chemokine secretion and downregulation of BCL6 the transcriptional repressor of CCL3 In contrast IgD signaling induced activation of the cytoskeletal protein HS1 along with F-actin polymerization which resulted in rapid receptor internalization and failure to support downstream responses including CLL cell survival and chemokine secretion IgM and IgD receptor downmodulation HS1 and ERK activation chemokine secretion and BCL6 downregulation were also observed when CLL cells were cocultured with nurselike cells The Bruton 's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib effectively inhibited both IgM and IgD isotype signaling In conclusion through a variety of functional readouts we demonstrate very distinct outcomes of IgM and IgD isotype activation in CLL cells providing novel insight into the regulation of BCR signaling in CLL,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[1062, 314, 16, 8, 854, 10781, 308, 4, 442, 1193, 552, 96, 552, 37, 1669, 34371, 1, 2852, 2, 16730, 19010, 84, 3, 2925, 1, 46, 19010, 6, 583, 253, 469, 5252, 395, 21, 673, 565, 362, 59, 2852, 2, 16730, 314, 4, 9957, 1355, 672, 315, 552, 37, 2, 4, 552, 37, 3197, 5, 28698, 37, 8, 202, 17, 7557, 3, 263, 289, 995, 2852, 314, 277, 1069, 363, 1, 1819, 1549, 2, 2992, 552, 31, 25, 9711, 2, 12660, 3596, 2935, 2, 2475, 1, 8148, 3, 1431, 7434, 1, 9711, 4, 748, 16730, 314, 277, 363, 1, 3, 10055, 178, 41532, 1510, 5, 1068, 5525, 12273, 92, 627, 4, 1321, 153, 7520, 2, 496, 6, 538, 1489, 253, 141, 552, 31, 25, 2, 3596, 2935, 2852, 2, 16730, 153, 23081, 41532, 2, 1819, 363, 3596, 2935, 2, 8148, 2475, 11, 120, 164, 198, 552, 37, 11, 11444, 5, 28698, 37, 3, 5796, 292, 564, 216, 230, 1795, 1856, 879, 110, 2852, 2, 16730, 11420, 314, 4, 1221, 298, 8, 1362, 1, 583, 19040, 21, 608, 923, 834, 123, 1, 2852, 2, 16730, 11420, 363, 4, 552, 37, 1736, 229, 2670, 237, 3, 863, 1, 1062, 314, 4, 552]",1365.0,27534555,498
Individual differences in physical symptom burden and psychological responses in individuals with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Annals of hematology,Ann. Hematol.,2016-08-19,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an incurable illness, with some patients requiring no treatment until disease progression. Burden from physical symptoms has been associated with depression, anxiety, and stress in cancer patients. Additionally, patient factors, i.e., individual differences, have been associated with worse psychological outcomes. There are few psychological studies of CLL, with no examination of individual differences. A cross-sectional design studied the covariation of symptom burden with depressive and anxiety symptoms and cancer-specific stress, and tested patients' individual differences as predictors and as moderators. CLL patients (N = 112) receiving active surveillance participated. They were Caucasian (100 %) and predominately male (55 %) with a mean age of 61; most (62.5 %) had stage 0 disease. A composite measure of physical symptom burden (CLL symptoms, fatigue, pain, impaired functional status) was tested as a predictor of psychological responses. Individual differences in psychiatric history and social support were tested as moderators. Using multiple linear regression, greater symptom burden covaried with higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms and cancer stress (ps < .05). Those with a psychiatric history, low social support, and low relationship satisfaction with one's partner reported greater symptom burden and more psychological symptoms and stress (ps < .05).

Review: Current clinical applications of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T cells.,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,2016-08-31,"The past several years have been marked by extraordinary advances in clinical applications of immunotherapy. In particular, adoptive cellular therapy utilizing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells targeted to CD19 has demonstrated substantial clinical efficacy in children and adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and durable clinical benefit in a smaller subset of patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL).

Identification of a structurally novel BTK mutation that drives ibrutinib resistance in CLL.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2016-10-01,"Ibrutinib (ibr), a first-in-class Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, has demonstrated high response rates in both relapsed/refractory and treatment naïve chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, about 25% of patients discontinue ibrutinib therapy at a median follow-up of 20 months and many patients discontinue the treatment due to leukemia progression or Richter transformation. Mutations affecting the C481 residue of BTK disrupt ibrutinib binding and have been characterized by us and others as the most common mechanism of ibrutinib resistance. Thus far, all described BTK mutations are located in its kinase domain and mutations outside this domain have never been described. Herein, we report a patient whose CLL progressed, was salvaged with ibrutinib and then relapsed. Serial analysis of samples throughout patient's clinical course identified a structurally novel mutation (BTKT316A) in the SH2 domain, but not kinase domain, of Bruton tyrosine kinase which was associated with disease relapse. Functionally, cells carrying BTKT316A show resistance to ibrutinib at both cellular and molecular levels to a similar extent as BTKC481S.

"A phase I-II trial of fludarabine, bendamustine and rituximab (FBR) in previously treated patients with CLL.",Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2017-03-01,"Chemoimmunotherapy regimens have been the standard first-line therapy for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). For young, fit patients the standard of care is combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR). Based on the preclinical work demonstrating that bendamustine combined with fludarabine resulted in increased DNA damage, we designed a phase I-II clinical trial with fludarabine, bendamustine, and rituximab (FBR) for patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. Treatment consisted of fludarabine 20 mg/m2 daily x 3 days and rituximab 375-500 mg/m2 x 1 day. Phase I included bendamustine at increasing doses of 20, 30, 40, or 50 mg/m2 daily x 3 days; phase II was with FR, and B at the selected dose. DNA damage response (H2AX phosphorylation) was evaluated in a subset of patients. Fifty-one patients were enrolled. The median age was 62 years; median number of prior therapies was 2; 40% had del(11q); and 41 patients had received prior FCR-based therapies. Hematologic toxicity was more common in ≥40 mg/m2 dose cohorts. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not identified. Bendamustine-elicited H2AX phosphorylation was not dose-dependent, but markedly increased after fludarabine. We identified bendamustine 30 mg/m2 as the safe dose for phase II. The overall response rate (ORR) was 67% with 36% complete response (CR) / CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi). Younger patients (<65 years) had significantly higher ORR (81% vs. 50%; p=0.038).

We performed a systematic review to identify prospective randomized controlled trials comparing allo-HCT against novel therapies for treatment of CLL at various disease stages. In the absence of such data, we invited physicians with expertise in allo-HCT and/or CLL to participate in developing these recommendations. We followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. For standard-risk CLL we recommend allo-HCT in the absence of response or if there is evidence of disease progression after B cell receptor (BCR) inhibitors. For high-risk CLL an allo-HCT is recommended after failing 2 lines of therapy and showing an objective response to BCR inhibitors or to a clinical trial. It is also recommended for patients who fail to show an objective response or progress after BCR inhibitors and receive BCL-2 inhibitors, regardless of whether an objective response is achieved. For Richter transformation, we recommend allo-HCT upon demonstration of an objective response to anthracycline-based chemotherapy.

Targeting BTK through microRNA in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2016-10-17,"Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a critical mediator of survival in B-cell neoplasms. Although BTK inhibitors have transformed therapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), patients with high-risk genetics are at risk for relapse and have a poor prognosis. Identification of novel therapeutic strategies for this group of patients is an urgent unmet clinical need, and therapies that target BTK via alternative mechanisms may fill this niche. Herein, we identify a set of microRNAs (miRs) that target BTK in primary CLL cells and show that the histone deacetylase (HDAC) repressor complex is recruited to these miR promoters to silence their expression. Targeting the HDACs by using either RNA interference against HDAC1 in CLL or a small molecule inhibitor (HDACi) in CLL and mantle cell lymphoma restored the expression of the BTK-targeting miRs with loss of BTK protein and downstream signaling and consequent cell death. We have also made the novel and clinically relevant discovery that inhibition of HDAC induces the BTK-targeting miRs in ibrutinib-sensitive and resistant CLL to effectively reduce both wild-type and C481S-mutant BTK. This finding identifies a novel strategy that may be promising as a therapeutic modality to eliminate the C481S-mutant BTK clone that drives resistance to ibrutinib and provides the rationale for a combination strategy that includes ibrutinib to dually target BTK to suppress its prosurvival signaling.",Journal Article,1191.0,15.0,Bruton 's tyrosine kinase BTK is a critical mediator of survival in B-cell neoplasms Although BTK inhibitors have transformed therapy in chronic lymphocytic CLL patients with high-risk genetics are at risk for relapse and have a poor prognosis Identification of novel therapeutic strategies for this group of patients is an urgent unmet clinical need and therapies that target BTK via alternative mechanisms may fill this niche Herein we identify a set of microRNAs miRs that target BTK in primary CLL cells and show that the histone deacetylase HDAC repressor complex is recruited to these miR promoters to silence their expression Targeting the HDACs by using either RNA interference against HDAC1 in CLL or a small molecule inhibitor HDACi in CLL and mantle cell restored the expression of the BTK-targeting miRs with loss of BTK protein and downstream signaling and consequent cell death We have also made the novel and clinically relevant discovery that inhibition of HDAC induces the BTK-targeting miRs in ibrutinib-sensitive and resistant CLL to effectively reduce both wild-type and C481S-mutant BTK This finding identifies a novel strategy that may be promising as a therapeutic modality to eliminate the C481S-mutant BTK clone that drives resistance to ibrutinib and provides the rationale for a combination strategy that includes ibrutinib to dually target BTK to suppress its prosurvival signaling,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[5796, 292, 564, 216, 3611, 16, 8, 740, 3810, 1, 25, 4, 132, 31, 1179, 242, 3611, 222, 47, 2423, 36, 4, 442, 1193, 552, 7, 5, 64, 43, 2894, 32, 28, 43, 9, 429, 2, 47, 8, 334, 356, 911, 1, 229, 189, 422, 9, 26, 87, 1, 7, 16, 35, 5013, 3715, 38, 594, 2, 235, 17, 283, 3611, 847, 1091, 483, 68, 11476, 26, 4385, 1986, 21, 255, 8, 916, 1, 3515, 7569, 17, 283, 3611, 4, 86, 552, 37, 2, 514, 17, 3, 1508, 2732, 2654, 7434, 840, 16, 2619, 6, 46, 722, 4347, 6, 13557, 136, 55, 529, 3, 7803, 20, 75, 361, 893, 3182, 480, 14241, 4, 552, 15, 8, 302, 1354, 230, 4265, 4, 552, 2, 2757, 31, 4138, 3, 55, 1, 3, 3611, 529, 7569, 5, 407, 1, 3611, 178, 2, 1489, 314, 2, 8436, 31, 273, 21, 47, 120, 1229, 3, 229, 2, 505, 867, 1574, 17, 297, 1, 2654, 1516, 3, 3611, 529, 7569, 4, 1795, 745, 2, 436, 552, 6, 1856, 969, 110, 955, 267, 2, 17045, 620, 3611, 26, 1567, 2953, 8, 229, 692, 17, 68, 40, 721, 22, 8, 189, 1396, 6, 4964, 3, 17045, 620, 3611, 3910, 17, 5267, 251, 6, 1795, 2, 777, 3, 1728, 9, 8, 150, 692, 17, 1920, 1795, 6, 11409, 283, 3611, 6, 3134, 211, 7331, 314]",1409.0,27756747,595
Long-term Follow-up of Treatment with Ibrutinib and Rituximab in Patients with High-Risk Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2016-10-19,"<b>Background:</b> Ibrutinib is an active therapy with an acceptable safety profile for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), including high-risk patients with del17p or with <i>TP53</i> mutations. Ibrutinib is broadly indicated for the treatment of patients with CLL and specifically including those with 17p deletion. The optimal use of ibrutinib in combination with other agents remains controversial.<b>Experimental Design:</b> We report the long-term outcome [median follow-up of 47 months (range, 36-51 months)] of 40 patients with high-risk CLL, treated on the first ibrutinib combination trial with rituximab (IR). The majority of patients (36/40) were previously treated.<b>Results:</b> Median age was 65 years, and 21 patients (52%) had 17p deletion. Median duration on treatment was 41 months (range, 2-51 months), and median number of treatment cycles was 42 (range, 2-49). Overall response rate was 95%, and 9 patients (23%) attained a complete remission. Twenty-one patients discontinued treatment, 10 due to disease progression, 9 for other causes, and 2 due to stem cell transplantation; the remaining 19 patients continue on ibrutinib.

Ibrutinib efficacy and tolerability in patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia following allogeneic HCT.,Blood,Blood,2016-11-01,"Ibrutinib, a potent and irreversible small-molecule inhibitor of both Bruton's tyrosine kinase and interleukin-2 inducible kinase (ITK), has been used to treat relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with prolongation of progression-free and overall survival. Here, we present 27 patients with relapsed CLL following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) who subsequently received ibrutinib salvage therapy. Sixteen of these patients were part of multi-institutional clinical trials and achieved an overall response rate of 87.5%. An additional 11 patients were treated at Stanford University following US Food and Drug Administration approval of ibrutinib; 7 (64%) achieved a complete response, and 3 (27%) achieved a partial response. Of the 9 patients treated at Stanford who had mixed chimerism-associated CLL relapse, 4 (44%) converted to full donor chimerism following ibrutinib initiation, in association with disease response. Four of 11 (36%) patients evaluated by ClonoSeq achieved minimal residual disease negativity with CLL <1/10 000 white blood cells, which persisted even after ibrutinib was discontinued, in 1 case even after 26 months. None of the 27 patients developed graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) following ibrutinib initiation. We postulate that ibrutinib augments the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) benefit through a T-cell-mediated effect, most likely due to ITK inhibition.

High-level ROR1 associates with accelerated disease progression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2016-11-04,"ROR1 is an oncoembryonic orphan receptor found on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells, but not on normal postpartum tissues. ROR1 is a receptor for Wnt5a that may complex with TCL1, a coactivator of AKT that is able to promote development of CLL. We found the CLL cells of a few patients expressed negligible ROR1 (ROR1<sup>Neg</sup>), but expressed TCL1A at levels comparable to those of samples that expressed ROR1 (ROR1<sup>Pos</sup>). Transcriptome analyses revealed that ROR1<sup>Neg</sup> cases generally could be distinguished from those that were ROR1<sup>Pos</sup> in unsupervised gene-expression clustering analysis. Gene-set enrichment analyses demonstrated that ROR1<sup>Neg</sup> CLL had lower expression and activation of AKT signaling pathways relative to ROR1<sup>Pos</sup> CLL, similar to what was noted for leukemia that respectively developed in TCL1 vs ROR1xTCL1 transgenic mice. In contrast to its effect on ROR1<sup>Pos</sup> CLL, Wnt5a did not enhance the proliferation, chemotaxis, or survival of ROR1<sup>Neg</sup> CLL. We examined the CLL cells from 1568 patients, which we randomly assigned to a training or validation set of 797 or 771 cases, respectively. Using recursive partitioning, we defined a threshold for ROR1 surface expression that could segregate samples of the training set into ROR1-Hi vs ROR1-Lo subgroups that differed significantly in their median treatment-free survival (TFS). Using this threshold, we found that ROR1-Hi cases had a significantly shorter median TFS and overall survival than ROR1-Lo cases in the validation set. These data demonstrate that expression of ROR1 may promote leukemia-cell activation and survival and enhance disease progression in patients with CLL.",Journal Article,1173.0,33.0,ROR1 is an oncoembryonic orphan receptor found on chronic lymphocytic CLL B cells but not on normal postpartum tissues ROR1 is a receptor for Wnt5a that may complex with TCL1 a coactivator of AKT that is able to promote development of CLL We found the CLL cells of a few patients expressed negligible ROR1 ROR1 sup Neg /sup but expressed TCL1A at levels comparable to those of samples that expressed ROR1 ROR1 sup Pos /sup Transcriptome analyses revealed that ROR1 sup Neg /sup cases generally could be distinguished from those that were ROR1 sup Pos /sup in unsupervised gene-expression clustering analysis Gene-set enrichment analyses demonstrated that ROR1 sup Neg /sup CLL had lower expression and activation of AKT signaling pathways relative to ROR1 sup Pos /sup CLL similar to what was noted for that respectively developed in TCL1 vs ROR1xTCL1 transgenic mice In contrast to its effect on ROR1 sup Pos /sup CLL Wnt5a did not enhance the proliferation chemotaxis or survival of ROR1 sup Neg /sup CLL We examined the CLL cells from 1568 patients which we randomly assigned to a training or validation set of 797 or 771 cases respectively Using recursive partitioning we defined a threshold for ROR1 surface expression that could segregate samples of the training set into ROR1-Hi vs ROR1-Lo subgroups that differed significantly in their median treatment-free survival TFS Using this threshold we found that ROR1-Hi cases had a significantly shorter median TFS and overall survival than ROR1-Lo cases in the validation set These data demonstrate that expression of ROR1 may promote leukemia-cell activation and survival and enhance disease progression in patients with CLL,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[9826, 16, 35, 69302, 9814, 153, 204, 23, 442, 1193, 552, 132, 37, 84, 44, 23, 295, 7830, 742, 9826, 16, 8, 153, 9, 8123, 17, 68, 840, 5, 8979, 8, 8777, 1, 649, 17, 16, 1665, 6, 1617, 193, 1, 552, 21, 204, 3, 552, 37, 1, 8, 1021, 7, 570, 6821, 9826, 9826, 172, 8696, 172, 84, 570, 34985, 28, 148, 1279, 6, 135, 1, 347, 17, 570, 9826, 9826, 172, 7833, 172, 3917, 318, 553, 17, 9826, 172, 8696, 172, 140, 1228, 359, 40, 4735, 29, 135, 17, 11, 9826, 172, 7833, 172, 4, 6512, 145, 55, 3147, 65, 145, 916, 3020, 318, 264, 17, 9826, 172, 8696, 172, 552, 42, 280, 55, 2, 363, 1, 649, 314, 460, 580, 6, 9826, 172, 7833, 172, 552, 288, 6, 2067, 10, 1051, 9, 17, 106, 276, 4, 8979, 105, 69303, 2862, 399, 4, 748, 6, 211, 254, 23, 9826, 172, 7833, 172, 552, 8123, 205, 44, 1304, 3, 457, 12561, 15, 25, 1, 9826, 172, 8696, 172, 552, 21, 409, 3, 552, 37, 29, 50082, 7, 92, 21, 1108, 896, 6, 8, 1741, 15, 929, 916, 1, 13379, 15, 15186, 140, 106, 75, 4493, 4515, 21, 395, 8, 2390, 9, 9826, 1255, 55, 17, 359, 13258, 347, 1, 3, 1741, 916, 237, 9826, 5910, 105, 9826, 10364, 1453, 17, 2512, 97, 4, 136, 52, 24, 115, 25, 7335, 75, 26, 2390, 21, 204, 17, 9826, 5910, 140, 42, 8, 97, 985, 52, 7335, 2, 63, 25, 76, 9826, 10364, 140, 4, 3, 929, 916, 46, 74, 608, 17, 55, 1, 9826, 68, 1617, 2647, 31, 363, 2, 25, 2, 1304, 34, 91, 4, 7, 5, 552]",1678.0,27815263,427

Here we report the results of an open-label, randomized phase II trial comparing the combination of pentostatin, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (PCR) either without or with bevacizumab (PCR-B) in previously untreated CLL patients. A total of 65 evaluable patients were enrolled, 32 receiving PCR and 33 PCR-B. A higher rate of grade 3-4 cardiovascular toxicity was observed with PCR-B (33% vs. 3%, p < 0.003). Patients treated with PCR-B had a trend for a higher complete remission (CR) rate (54.5% vs 31.3%; p = 0.08), longer progression-free survival (PFS)(p = 0.06) and treatment-free survival (TFS)(p = 0.09). No differences in PFS and TFS by IGHV mutational status were observed with the addition of bevacizumab. A significant post-treatment increase in VEGF levels was observed in the PCR-B arm (29.77 to 57.05 pg/mL); in the PCR-B arm, lower baseline CCL-3 levels were significantly associated with achievement of CR (p = 0.01). In conclusion, the addition of bevacizumab to chemoimmunotherapy in CLL is generally well-tolerated and appears to prolong PFS and TFS.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",1176.0,4.0,Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF with in vitro pro-apoptotic and antiangiogenic effects on chronic lymphocytic CLL cells As monotherapy in patients with CLL it has no clinical activity Here we report the results of an open-label randomized phase II trial comparing the combination of pentostatin cyclophosphamide and rituximab PCR either without or with bevacizumab PCR-B in previously untreated CLL patients A total of 65 evaluable patients were enrolled 32 receiving PCR and 33 PCR-B A higher rate of grade 3-4 cardiovascular toxicity was observed with PCR-B 33 vs. 3 p 0.003 Patients treated with PCR-B had a trend for a higher complete remission CR rate 54.5 vs 31.3 p 0.08 longer progression-free survival PFS p 0.06 and treatment-free survival TFS p 0.09 No differences in PFS and TFS by IGHV mutational status were observed with the addition of bevacizumab A significant post-treatment increase in VEGF levels was observed in the PCR-B arm 29.77 to 57.05 pg/mL in the PCR-B arm lower baseline CCL-3 levels were significantly associated with achievement of CR p 0.01 In conclusion the addition of bevacizumab to chemoimmunotherapy in CLL is generally well-tolerated and appears to prolong PFS and TFS,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[599, 16, 8, 848, 548, 529, 756, 845, 129, 161, 618, 5, 4, 439, 1805, 1631, 2, 2168, 176, 23, 442, 1193, 552, 37, 22, 1411, 4, 7, 5, 552, 192, 71, 77, 38, 128, 467, 21, 414, 3, 99, 1, 35, 1020, 1756, 384, 124, 215, 160, 1430, 3, 150, 1, 7596, 1112, 2, 855, 604, 361, 187, 15, 5, 599, 604, 132, 4, 373, 1278, 552, 7, 8, 181, 1, 556, 859, 7, 11, 346, 531, 357, 604, 2, 466, 604, 132, 8, 142, 116, 1, 88, 27, 39, 2179, 155, 10, 164, 5, 604, 132, 466, 105, 27, 19, 13, 1421, 7, 73, 5, 604, 132, 42, 8, 853, 9, 8, 142, 236, 734, 684, 116, 667, 33, 105, 456, 27, 19, 13, 1592, 589, 91, 115, 25, 300, 19, 13, 1460, 2, 24, 115, 25, 7335, 19, 13, 1730, 77, 362, 4, 300, 2, 7335, 20, 6220, 1619, 156, 11, 164, 5, 3, 352, 1, 599, 8, 93, 539, 24, 344, 4, 618, 148, 10, 164, 4, 3, 604, 132, 475, 462, 849, 6, 696, 474, 3234, 542, 4, 3, 604, 132, 475, 280, 330, 20773, 27, 148, 11, 97, 41, 5, 5088, 1, 684, 19, 13, 355, 4, 1221, 3, 352, 1, 599, 6, 4438, 4, 552, 16, 1228, 149, 421, 2, 1233, 6, 3615, 300, 2, 7335]",1260.0,27861157,573
Economic Burden of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia in the Era of Oral Targeted Therapies in the United States.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-11-21,"Purpose Oral targeted therapies represent a significant advance for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); however, their high cost has raised concerns about affordability and the economic impact on society. Our objective was to project the future prevalence and cost burden of CLL in the era of oral targeted therapies in the United States. Methods We developed a simulation model that evaluated the evolving management of CLL from 2011 to 2025: chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) as the standard of care before 2014, oral targeted therapies for patients with del(17p) and relapsed CLL from 2014, and for first-line treatment from 2016 onward. A comparator scenario also was simulated where CIT remained the standard of care throughout. Disease progression and survival parameters for each therapy were based on published clinical trials. Results The number of people living with CLL in the United States is projected to increase from 128,000 in 2011 to 199,000 by 2025 (55% increase) due to improved survival; meanwhile, the annual cost of CLL management will increase from $0.74 billion to $5.13 billion (590% increase). The per-patient lifetime cost of CLL treatment will increase from $147,000 to $604,000 (310% increase) as oral targeted therapies become the first-line treatment. For patients enrolled in Medicare, the corresponding total out-of-pocket cost will increase from $9,200 to $57,000 (520% increase). Compared with the CIT scenario, oral targeted therapies resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $189,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Conclusion The increased benefit and cost of oral targeted therapies is projected to enhance CLL survivorship but can impose a substantial financial burden on both patients and payers. More sustainable pricing strategies for targeted therapies are needed to avoid financial toxicity to patients.",Journal Article,1156.0,57.0,"Purpose Oral targeted therapies represent a significant advance for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic CLL however their high cost has raised concerns about affordability and the economic impact on society Our objective was to project the future prevalence and cost burden of CLL in the era of oral targeted therapies in the United States Methods We developed a simulation model that evaluated the evolving management of CLL from 2011 to 2025 chemoimmunotherapy CIT as the standard of care before 2014 oral targeted therapies for patients with del 17p and relapsed CLL from 2014 and for first-line treatment from 2016 onward A comparator scenario also was simulated where CIT remained the standard of care throughout Disease progression and survival parameters for each therapy were based on published clinical trials Results The number of people living with CLL in the United States is projected to increase from 128,000 in 2011 to 199,000 by 2025 55 increase due to improved survival meanwhile the annual cost of CLL management will increase from 0.74 billion to 5.13 billion 590 increase The per-patient lifetime cost of CLL treatment will increase from 147,000 to 604,000 310 increase as oral targeted therapies become the first-line treatment For patients enrolled in Medicare the corresponding total out-of-pocket cost will increase from 9,200 to 57,000 520 increase Compared with the CIT scenario oral targeted therapies resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 189,000 per quality-adjusted life-year Conclusion The increased benefit and cost of oral targeted therapies is projected to enhance CLL survivorship but can impose a substantial financial burden on both patients and payers More sustainable pricing strategies for targeted therapies are needed to avoid financial toxicity to patients",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[743, 518, 238, 235, 1231, 8, 93, 3148, 9, 3, 24, 1, 7, 5, 442, 1193, 552, 137, 136, 64, 835, 71, 5673, 2061, 545, 13211, 2, 3, 3875, 345, 23, 1174, 114, 461, 10, 6, 3105, 3, 508, 1078, 2, 835, 892, 1, 552, 4, 3, 1713, 1, 518, 238, 235, 4, 3, 1088, 907, 636, 21, 276, 8, 4026, 202, 17, 194, 3, 3276, 284, 1, 552, 29, 1132, 6, 18457, 4438, 9192, 22, 3, 260, 1, 165, 348, 1409, 518, 238, 235, 9, 7, 5, 3084, 4135, 2, 591, 552, 29, 1409, 2, 9, 157, 328, 24, 29, 1390, 15088, 8, 8944, 5456, 120, 10, 5872, 1257, 9192, 958, 3, 260, 1, 165, 2432, 34, 91, 2, 25, 1038, 9, 296, 36, 11, 90, 23, 983, 38, 143, 99, 3, 207, 1, 3788, 2798, 5, 552, 4, 3, 1088, 907, 16, 5633, 6, 344, 29, 3990, 984, 4, 1132, 6, 5840, 984, 20, 18457, 614, 344, 520, 6, 231, 25, 8197, 3, 2114, 835, 1, 552, 284, 303, 344, 29, 13, 794, 10243, 6, 33, 233, 10243, 11176, 344, 3, 379, 69, 2898, 835, 1, 552, 24, 303, 344, 29, 4961, 984, 6, 12100, 984, 8292, 344, 22, 518, 238, 235, 1417, 3, 157, 328, 24, 9, 7, 346, 4, 1378, 3, 1734, 181, 1205, 1, 6575, 835, 303, 344, 29, 83, 1250, 6, 696, 984, 9158, 344, 72, 5, 3, 9192, 5456, 518, 238, 235, 627, 4, 35, 3648, 835, 1236, 197, 1, 5899, 984, 379, 372, 586, 358, 111, 1221, 3, 101, 247, 2, 835, 1, 518, 238, 235, 16, 5633, 6, 1304, 552, 2560, 84, 122, 15099, 8, 1281, 3021, 892, 23, 110, 7, 2, 9361, 80, 13226, 25326, 422, 9, 238, 235, 32, 575, 6, 3085, 3021, 155, 6, 7]",1831.0,27870563,356

Mice received either vehicle or acalabrutinib formulated into the drinking water.<b>Results:</b> Utilizing biochemical assays, we demonstrate that acalabrutinib is a highly selective BTK inhibitor as compared with ibrutinib. In the human CLL NSG xenograft model, treatment with acalabrutinib demonstrated on-target effects, including decreased phosphorylation of PLCγ2, ERK, and significant inhibition of CLL cell proliferation. Furthermore, tumor burden in the spleen of the mice treated with acalabrutinib was significantly decreased compared with vehicle-treated mice. Similarly, in the TCL1 adoptive transfer model, decreased phosphorylation of BTK, PLCγ2, and S6 was observed. Most notably, treatment with acalabrutinib resulted in a significant increase in survival compared with mice receiving vehicle.<b>Conclusions:</b> Treatment with acalabrutinib potently inhibits BTK <i>in vivo</i>, leading to on-target decreases in the activation of key signaling molecules (including BTK, PLCγ2, S6, and ERK). In two complementary mouse models of CLL, acalabrutinib significantly reduced tumor burden and increased survival compared with vehicle treatment. Overall, acalabrutinib showed increased BTK selectivity compared with ibrutinib while demonstrating significant antitumor efficacy <i>in vivo</i> on par with ibrutinib. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(11); 2831-41. ©2016 AACR</i>.",Journal Article,1147.0,35.0,b Purpose /b Acalabrutinib ACP-196 is a novel potent and highly selective Bruton tyrosine kinase BTK inhibitor which binds covalently to Cys481 in the ATP-binding pocket of BTK We sought to evaluate the antitumor effects of acalabrutinib treatment in two established mouse models of chronic lymphocytic CLL b Experimental Design /b Two distinct mouse models were used the TCL1 adoptive transfer model where leukemic cells from Eμ-TCL1 transgenic mice are transplanted into C57BL/6 mice and the human NSG primary CLL xenograft model Mice received either vehicle or acalabrutinib formulated into the drinking water. b Results /b Utilizing biochemical assays we demonstrate that acalabrutinib is a highly selective BTK inhibitor as compared with ibrutinib In the human CLL NSG xenograft model treatment with acalabrutinib demonstrated on-target effects including decreased phosphorylation of PLCγ2 ERK and significant inhibition of CLL cell proliferation Furthermore tumor burden in the spleen of the mice treated with acalabrutinib was significantly decreased compared with vehicle-treated mice Similarly in the TCL1 adoptive transfer model decreased phosphorylation of BTK PLCγ2 and S6 was observed Most notably treatment with acalabrutinib resulted in a significant increase in survival compared with mice receiving vehicle. b Conclusions /b Treatment with acalabrutinib potently inhibits BTK i in vivo /i leading to on-target decreases in the activation of key signaling molecules including BTK PLCγ2 S6 and ERK In two complementary mouse models of CLL acalabrutinib significantly reduced tumor burden and increased survival compared with vehicle treatment Overall acalabrutinib showed increased BTK selectivity compared with ibrutinib while demonstrating significant antitumor efficacy i in vivo /i on par with ibrutinib i Clin Cancer Res 23 11 2831-41 ©2016 AACR /i,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[132, 743, 132, 11378, 6953, 6369, 16, 8, 229, 1157, 2, 561, 1094, 5796, 564, 216, 3611, 230, 92, 3333, 10732, 6, 25598, 4, 3, 3918, 791, 6575, 1, 3611, 21, 990, 6, 376, 3, 579, 176, 1, 11378, 24, 4, 100, 635, 830, 274, 1, 442, 1193, 552, 132, 1560, 771, 132, 100, 834, 830, 274, 11, 95, 3, 8979, 3159, 2602, 202, 1257, 2015, 37, 29, 17467, 8979, 2862, 399, 32, 4600, 237, 7049, 49, 399, 2, 3, 171, 13446, 86, 552, 1330, 202, 399, 103, 361, 4974, 15, 11378, 7495, 237, 3, 7485, 4388, 132, 99, 132, 2600, 1487, 1013, 21, 608, 17, 11378, 16, 8, 561, 1094, 3611, 230, 22, 72, 5, 1795, 4, 3, 171, 552, 13446, 1330, 202, 24, 5, 11378, 264, 23, 283, 176, 141, 340, 982, 1, 21785, 1819, 2, 93, 297, 1, 552, 31, 457, 798, 30, 892, 4, 3, 4071, 1, 3, 399, 73, 5, 11378, 10, 97, 340, 72, 5, 4974, 73, 399, 1813, 4, 3, 8979, 3159, 2602, 202, 340, 982, 1, 3611, 21785, 2, 4977, 10, 164, 96, 2552, 24, 5, 11378, 627, 4, 8, 93, 344, 4, 25, 72, 5, 399, 357, 4974, 132, 2130, 132, 24, 5, 11378, 4684, 1576, 3611, 70, 4, 386, 70, 1049, 6, 23, 283, 2140, 4, 3, 363, 1, 825, 314, 1598, 141, 3611, 21785, 4977, 2, 1819, 4, 100, 3380, 830, 274, 1, 552, 11378, 97, 405, 30, 892, 2, 101, 25, 72, 5, 4974, 24, 63, 11378, 224, 101, 3611, 6072, 72, 5, 1795, 369, 2219, 93, 579, 209, 70, 4, 386, 70, 23, 7112, 5, 1795, 70, 2459, 12, 1936, 382, 175, 41614, 605, 3456, 1630, 70]",1868.0,27903679,648

Cancer Res.,2016-12-29,"<b>Purpose:</b> Ibrutinib inhibits Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) by irreversibly binding to the Cys-481 residue in the enzyme. However, ibrutinib also inhibits several other enzymes that contain cysteine residues homologous to Cys-481 in BTK. Patients with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) demonstrate a high overall response rate to ibrutinib with prolonged survival. Acalabrutinib, a selective BTK inhibitor developed to minimize off-target activity, has shown promising overall response rates in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. A head-to-head comparison of ibrutinib and acalabrutinib in CLL cell cultures and healthy T cells is needed to understand preclinical biologic and molecular effects.<b>Experimental Design:</b> Using samples from patients with CLL, we compared the effects of both BTK inhibitors on biologic activity, chemokine production, cell migration, BTK phosphorylation, and downstream signaling in primary CLL lymphocytes and on normal T-cell signaling to determine the effects on other kinases.<b>Results:</b> Both BTK inhibitors induced modest cell death accompanied by cleavage of PARP and caspase-3. Production of CCL3 and CCL4 chemokines and pseudoemperipolesis were inhibited by both drugs to a similar degree. These drugs also showed similar inhibitory effects on the phosphorylation of BTK and downstream S6 and ERK kinases.

The effects of ibrutinib treatment on the T cell compartment, which is clonally expanded and thought to support the growth of malignant B cells in CLL, are not fully characterized. Using next-generation sequencing technology, we characterized the diversity of TCRβ-chains in peripheral blood T cells from 15 CLL patients before and after 1 y of ibrutinib therapy. We noted elevated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell numbers and a restricted TCRβ repertoire in all pretreatment samples. After 1 y of ibrutinib therapy, elevated peripheral blood T cell numbers and T cell-related cytokine levels had normalized, and T cell repertoire diversity increased significantly. Dominant TCRβ clones in pretreatment samples declined or became undetectable, and the number of productive unique clones increased significantly during ibrutinib therapy, with the emergence of large numbers of low-frequency TCRβ clones. Importantly, broader TCR repertoire diversity was associated with clinical efficacy and lower rates of infections during ibrutinib therapy.

Phase I First-in-Human Study of Venetoclax in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2017-01-17,"Purpose B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) overexpression is common in many non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes. A phase I trial in patients with NHL was conducted to determine safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of venetoclax, a selective, potent, orally bioavailable BCL-2 inhibitor. Patients and Methods A total of 106 patients with relapsed or refractory NHL received venetoclax once daily until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity at target doses from 200 to 1,200 mg in dose-escalation and safety expansion cohorts. Treatment commenced with a 3-week dose ramp-up period for most patients in dose-escalation cohorts and for all patients in safety expansion. Results NHL subtypes included mantle cell lymphoma (MCL; n = 28), follicular lymphoma (FL; n = 29), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; n = 34), DLBCL arising from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Richter transformation; n = 7), Waldenström macroglobulinemia (n = 4), and marginal zone lymphoma (n = 3). Venetoclax was generally well tolerated. Clinical tumor lysis syndrome was not observed, whereas laboratory tumor lysis syndrome was documented in three patients. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 103 patients (97%), a majority of which were grade 1 to 2 in severity. Grade 3 to 4 events were reported in 59 patients (56%), and the most common were hematologic, including anemia (15%), neutropenia (11%), and thrombocytopenia (9%). Overall response rate was 44% (MCL, 75%; FL, 38%; DLBCL, 18%). Estimated median progression-free survival was 6 months (MCL, 14 months; FL, 11 months; DLBCL, 1 month). Conclusion Selective targeting of BCL-2 with venetoclax was well tolerated, and single-agent activity varied among NHL subtypes. We determined 1,200 mg to be the recommended single-agent dose for future studies in FL and DLBCL, with 800 mg being sufficient to consistently achieve durable response in MCL.

Constitutive Phosphorylation of STAT3 by the CK2-BLNK-CD5 Complex.,Molecular cancer research : MCR,Mol. Cancer Res.,2017-01-27,"In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), STAT3 is constitutively phosphorylated on serine 727 and plays a role in the pathobiology of CLL. However, what induces constitutive phosphorylation of STAT3 is currently unknown. Mass spectrometry was used to identify casein kinase 2 (CK2), a serine/threonine kinase that coimmunoprecipitated with serine phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3). Furthermore, activated CK2 incubated with recombinant STAT3 induced phosphorylation of STAT3 on serine 727. Although STAT3 and CK2 are present in normal B- and T cells, STAT3 is not constitutively phosphorylated in these cells. Further study found that CD5 and BLNK coexpressed in CLL, but not in normal B- or T cells, are required for STAT3 phosphorylation. To elucidate the relationship of CD5 and BLNK to CK2 and STAT3, STAT3 was immunoprecipitated from CLL cells, and CK2, CD5, and BLNK were detected in the immunoprecipitate. Conversely, STAT3, CD5, and BLNK were in the immunoprecipitate of CLL cells immunoprecipitated with CK2 antibodies. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of CD5 or BLNK, or treatment with CD5-neutralizing antibodies significantly reduced the levels of serine pSTAT3 in CLL cells. Finally, confocal microscopy determined that CD5 is cell membrane bound, and fractionation studies revealed that the CK2/CD5/BLNK/STAT3 complex remains in the cytoplasm, whereas serine pSTAT3 is shuttled to the nucleus.<b>Implications:</b> These data show that the cellular proteins CK2, CD5, and BLNK are required for constitutive phosphorylation of STAT3 in CLL.

Pathways and mechanisms of venetoclax resistance.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2017-01-31,"The approval of venetoclax, a 'BH3-mimetic' antagonist of the BCL-2 anti-apoptotic protein, for chronic lymphocytic leukemia represents a major milestone in translational apoptosis research. Venetoclax has already received 'breakthrough' designation for acute myeloid leukemia, and is being studied in many other tumor types. However, resistance to BCL-2 inhibitor monotherapy may rapidly ensue. Several studies have shown that the other two major anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, BCL-X<sub>L</sub> and MCL-1, are the main determinants of resistance to venetoclax. This opens up possibilities for rationally combining venetoclax with other targeted agents to circumvent resistance. Here, we summarize the most promising combinations, and highlight those already in clinical trials. There is also increasing recognition that different tumors display different degrees of addiction to individual BCL-2 family proteins, and of the need to refine current 'BH3 profiling' techniques.

Long-term outcomes for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who discontinue ibrutinib.,Cancer,Cancer,2017-02-07,"Ibrutinib is a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor and is approved for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in frontline and relapsed/refractory settings. The authors previously reported poor outcomes for patients who discontinued ibrutinib; however, long-term outcomes were not reported. Data from 320 patients who received ibrutinib on clinical studies between 2010 and 2015 at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center were retrospectively analyzed. Long-term outcomes among patients with CLL after they discontinued ibrutinib were analyzed. Ninety of 320 patients (28%) who were treated on ibrutinib-based regimens discontinued ibrutinib. Of these, 80 had relapsed/refractory disease, and 10 were treatment-naive. The median time to discontinuation was 15 months (range, 1.2-54 months). After a median follow-up of 38 months after starting ibrutinib, 40 patients (44%) remained alive. Major reasons for ibrutinib discontinuation were intolerance (n = 29; 32%), miscellaneous (n = 28; 31%), progression (n = 19; 21%), and Richter transformation (RT) (n = 9; 10%). The median survival according to the reason for discontinuation was 33 months for ibrutinib intolerance, 11 months for miscellaneous causes, 16 months for progressive CLL, and 2 months for RT. Among the 19 patients who had progressive CLL, 42% responded to subsequent therapy. Ibrutinib discontinuation was observed during therapy. Patients with CLL who had disease transformation had especially poor outcomes, whereas those who developed progressive disease during ibrutinib therapy had a median survival of <1.5 years. Survival was associated with the reason for discontinuation; patients who had progressive CLL had better survival compared with those who had disease transformation. Effective salvage strategies for patients with CLL who progress on ibrutinib therapy is of critical importance.

Idelalisib and bendamustine combination is synergistic and increases DNA damage response in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2017-03-01,"Idelalisib is a targeted agent that potently inhibits PI3Kδ which is exclusively expressed in hematological cells. Bendamustine is a well-tolerated cytotoxic alkylating agent which has been extensively used for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Both these agents are FDA-approved for CLL. To increase the potency of idelalisib and bendamustine, we tested their combination in primary CLL lymphocytes. While each compound alone produced a moderate response, combination at several concentrations resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity. Idelalisib enhanced the bendamustine-mediated DNA damage/repair response, indicated by the phosphorylation of ATM, Chk2, and p53. Each drug alone activated γH2AX but combination treatment further increased the expression of this DNA damage marker. Compared with the control, idelalisib treatment decreased global RNA synthesis, resulting in a decline of early-response and short-lived MCL1 transcripts.

In this study, we performed miR expression analysis using NanoString nCounter to discover differentially regulated miRs after therapy with the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib. Of the differentially regulated miRs in the discovery set, miR-29c and miR-126 were confirmed using real-time PCR to be upregulated in CLL patient cells with ibrutinib therapy. In the validation set, an inverse correlation was observed between miR-126 levels and expression of its putative target p85β, an isoform of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase p85 regulatory subunit. We found that mRNA for the host gene EGFL7, primary unprocessed miR-126, and mature miR-126 are all downregulated in CLL cells compared to normal B cells. Patients in later stages of disease have a greater decrease in miR-126 expression compared to treatment-naive patients, indicating that lower miR-126 levels may associate with disease progression.

Impact of ibrutinib dose adherence on therapeutic efficacy in patients with previously treated CLL/SLL.,Blood,Blood,2017-04-03,"Ibrutinib, an oral inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), at a once-daily dose of 420 mg achieved BTK active-site occupancy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) that was maintained at 24 hours. It is unknown if intermittent interruption of ibrutinib therapy contributes to altered clinical outcomes. We therefore evaluated the effect of ibrutinib dose adherence on patient outcomes in the phase 3 RESONATE trial. The overall mean dose intensity (DI) was 95% with median treatment duration of ∼9 months. Pharmacokinetic assessment of ibrutinib exposure at 420-mg dose suggested similar exposure regardless of patient weight or age. As assessed by independent review committee, patients with higher DI experienced longer median progression-free survival (PFS) compared with those with lower DI regardless of del17p and/or <i>TP53</i> status. Of 79 patients requiring a drug hold, treatment was restarted at the original dose in 73 (92%) patients. Mean duration of a missed-dose event was 18.7 days (range, 8-56). Patients missing ≥8 consecutive days of ibrutinib had a shorter median PFS vs those missing <8 days (10.9 months vs not reached). These results support sustained adherence to once-daily ibrutinib dosing at 420 mg as clinically feasible to achieve optimal outcomes in patients with previously treated CLL.

"The long noncoding RNA, treRNA, decreases DNA damage and is associated with poor response to chemotherapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2017-04-01,"The study of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is an emerging area of cancer research, in part due to their ability to serve as disease biomarkers. However, few studies have investigated lncRNAs in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We have identified one particular lncRNA, treRNA, which is overexpressed in CLL B-cells. We measured transcript expression in 144 CLL patient samples and separated samples into high or low expression of treRNA relative to the overall median. We found that high expression of treRNA is significantly associated with shorter time to treatment. High treRNA also correlates with poor prognostic indicators such as unmutated IGHV and high ZAP70 protein expression. We validated these initial findings in samples collected in a clinical trial comparing the nucleoside analog fludarabine alone or in combination with the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide in untreated CLL samples collected prior to starting therapy (E2997). High expression of treRNA was independently prognostic for shorter progression free survival in patients receiving fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide. Given these results, in order to study the role of treRNA in DNA damage response we generated a model cell line system where treRNA was over-expressed in the human B-CLL cell line OSU-CLL. Relative to the vector control line, there was less cell death in OSU-CLL over-expressing treRNA after exposure to fludarabine and mafosfamide, due in part to a reduction in DNA damage.

BTK<sup>C481S</sup>-Mediated Resistance to Ibrutinib in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2017-02-13,"Purpose Therapeutic targeting of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) with ibrutinib in chronic lymphocytic leukemia has led to a paradigm shift in therapy, and relapse has been uncommon with current follow-up. Acquired mutations in BTK and PLCG2 can cause relapse, but data regarding the prevalence and natural history of these mutations are limited. Patients and Methods Patients accrued to four sequential studies of ibrutinib were included in these analyses. Deep sequencing for BTK and PLCG2 was performed retrospectively on patients who experienced relapse and prospectively on a screening population. Results With a median follow-up time of 3.4 years, the estimated cumulative incidence of progression at 4 years is 19% (95% CI, 14% to 24%). Baseline karyotypic complexity, presence of del(17)(p13.1), and age less than 65 years were risk factors for progression. Among patients who experienced relapse, acquired mutations of BTK or PLCG2 were found in 85% (95% CI, 71% to 94%), and these mutations were detected an estimated median of 9.3 months (95% CI, 7.6 to 11.7 months) before relapse. Of a group of 112 patients examined prospectively, eight patients have experienced relapse, and all of these patients had acquired resistance mutations before relapse. A resistance mutation was detected in an additional eight patients who have not yet met criteria for clinical relapse. Conclusion Relapse of chronic lymphocytic leukemia after ibrutinib is an issue of increasing clinical significance. We show that mutations in BTK and PLCG2 appear early and have the potential to be used as a biomarker for future relapse, suggesting an opportunity for intervention.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",1072.0,89.0,Purpose Therapeutic targeting of Bruton tyrosine kinase BTK with ibrutinib in chronic lymphocytic has led to a paradigm shift in therapy and relapse has been uncommon with current follow-up Acquired mutations in BTK and PLCG2 can cause relapse but data regarding the prevalence and natural history of these mutations are limited Patients and Methods Patients accrued to four sequential studies of ibrutinib were included in these analyses Deep sequencing for BTK and PLCG2 was performed retrospectively on patients who experienced relapse and prospectively on a screening population Results With a median follow-up time of 3.4 years the estimated cumulative incidence of progression at 4 years is 19 95 CI 14 to 24 Baseline karyotypic complexity presence of del 17 p13.1 and age less than 65 years were risk factors for progression Among patients who experienced relapse acquired mutations of BTK or PLCG2 were found in 85 95 CI 71 to 94 and these mutations were detected an estimated median of 9.3 months 95 CI 7.6 to 11.7 months before relapse Of a group of 112 patients examined prospectively eight patients have experienced relapse and all of these patients had acquired resistance mutations before relapse A resistance mutation was detected in an additional eight patients who have not yet met criteria for clinical relapse Conclusion Relapse of chronic lymphocytic after ibrutinib is an issue of increasing clinical significance We show that mutations in BTK and PLCG2 appear early and have the potential to be used as a biomarker for future relapse suggesting an opportunity for intervention,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[743, 189, 529, 1, 5796, 564, 216, 3611, 5, 1795, 4, 442, 1193, 71, 836, 6, 8, 2431, 3024, 4, 36, 2, 429, 71, 85, 2052, 5, 291, 166, 126, 1294, 138, 4, 3611, 2, 15432, 122, 708, 429, 84, 74, 666, 3, 1078, 2, 1504, 532, 1, 46, 138, 32, 383, 7, 2, 636, 7, 3198, 6, 294, 1787, 94, 1, 1795, 11, 159, 4, 46, 318, 2369, 615, 9, 3611, 2, 15432, 10, 173, 894, 23, 7, 54, 592, 429, 2, 1143, 23, 8, 453, 266, 99, 5, 8, 52, 166, 126, 98, 1, 27, 39, 60, 3, 661, 967, 287, 1, 91, 28, 39, 60, 16, 326, 48, 58, 213, 6, 259, 330, 9465, 3082, 463, 1, 3084, 269, 7914, 14, 2, 89, 299, 76, 556, 60, 11, 43, 130, 9, 91, 107, 7, 54, 592, 429, 1294, 138, 1, 3611, 15, 15432, 11, 204, 4, 772, 48, 58, 792, 6, 960, 2, 46, 138, 11, 530, 35, 661, 52, 1, 83, 27, 53, 48, 58, 67, 49, 6, 175, 67, 53, 348, 429, 1, 8, 87, 1, 3726, 7, 409, 1143, 659, 7, 47, 592, 429, 2, 62, 1, 46, 7, 42, 1294, 251, 138, 348, 429, 8, 251, 258, 10, 530, 4, 35, 402, 659, 7, 54, 47, 44, 1145, 543, 371, 9, 38, 429, 1221, 429, 1, 442, 1193, 50, 1795, 16, 35, 2537, 1, 602, 38, 724, 21, 514, 17, 138, 4, 3611, 2, 15432, 1322, 191, 2, 47, 3, 174, 6, 40, 95, 22, 8, 901, 9, 508, 429, 802, 35, 2666, 9, 788]",1598.0,28418267,98
Pembrolizumab in patients with CLL and Richter transformation or with relapsed CLL.,Blood,Blood,2017-04-19,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients progressed early on ibrutinib often develop Richter transformation (RT) with a short survival of about 4 months. Preclinical studies suggest that programmed death 1 (PD-1) pathway is critical to inhibit immune surveillance in CLL. This phase 2 study was designed to test the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab, a humanized PD-1-blocking antibody, at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks in relapsed and transformed CLL. Twenty-five patients including 16 relapsed CLL and 9 RT (all proven diffuse large cell lymphoma) patients were enrolled, and 60% received prior ibrutinib. Objective responses were observed in 4 out of 9 RT patients (44%) and in 0 out of 16 CLL patients (0%). All responses were observed in RT patients who had progression after prior therapy with ibrutinib. After a median follow-up time of 11 months, the median overall survival in the RT cohort was 10.7 months, but was not reached in RT patients who progressed after prior ibrutinib. Treatment-related grade 3 or above adverse events were reported in 15 (60%) patients and were manageable. Analyses of pretreatment tumor specimens from available patients revealed increased expression of PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and a trend of increased expression in PD-1 in the tumor microenvironment in patients who had confirmed responses. Overall, pembrolizumab exhibited selective efficacy in CLL patients with RT. The results of this study are the first to demonstrate the benefit of PD-1 blockade in CLL patients with RT, and could change the landscape of therapy for RT patients if further validated.

In an effort to improve these outcomes, patients with persistent CLL who were 90 to 100 days beyond alloSCT with no evidence of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) were randomized to receive lenalidomide or standard care (withdrawal of immunosuppression followed by donor lymphocyte infusion). Lenalidomide was initiated at 5 mg every other day and increased to 10 mg daily, if tolerated, in each patient. Of 38 patients enrolled, 17 (45%) met the eligibility criteria for randomization. Of these 17 patients, 8 were randomized to undergo lenalidomide therapy. Five (62%) patients had to stop taking the drug because of toxicity. The main reason for drug discontinuation was acute GVHD in 43% of patients. This incidence was 11% in the patients who were randomized to not receive lenalidomide. With a median follow-up of 2.6 years, the median survival was 3.4 years for those receiving lenalidomide.

"N-BLR, a primate-specific non-coding transcript leads to colorectal cancer invasion and migration.",Genome biology,Genome Biol.,2017-05-24,"Non-coding RNAs have been drawing increasing attention in recent years as functional data suggest that they play important roles in key cellular processes. N-BLR is a primate-specific long non-coding RNA that modulates the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, facilitates cell migration, and increases colorectal cancer invasion. We performed multivariate analyses of data from two independent cohorts of colorectal cancer patients and show that the abundance of N-BLR is associated with tumor stage, invasion potential, and overall patient survival. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments we found that N-BLR facilitates migration primarily via crosstalk with E-cadherin and ZEB1. We showed that this crosstalk is mediated by a pyknon, a short ~20 nucleotide-long DNA motif contained in the N-BLR transcript and is targeted by members of the miR-200 family. In light of these findings, we used a microarray to investigate the expression patterns of other pyknon-containing genomic loci. We found multiple such loci that are differentially transcribed between healthy and diseased tissues in colorectal cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Moreover, we identified several new loci whose expression correlates with the colorectal cancer patients' overall survival. The primate-specific N-BLR is a novel molecular contributor to the complex mechanisms that underlie metastasis in colorectal cancer and a potential novel biomarker for this disease. The presence of a functional pyknon within N-BLR and the related finding that many more pyknon-containing genomic loci in the human genome exhibit tissue-specific and disease-specific expression suggests the possibility of an alternative class of biomarkers and therapeutic targets that are primate-specific.",Journal Article,972.0,31.0,Non-coding RNAs have been drawing increasing attention in recent years as functional data suggest that they play important roles in key cellular processes N-BLR is a primate-specific long non-coding RNA that modulates the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition facilitates cell migration and increases cancer invasion We performed multivariate analyses of data from two independent cohorts of cancer patients and show that the abundance of N-BLR is associated with tumor stage invasion potential and overall patient survival Through in vitro and in vivo experiments we found that N-BLR facilitates migration primarily via crosstalk with E-cadherin and ZEB1 We showed that this crosstalk is mediated by a pyknon a short ~20 nucleotide-long DNA motif contained in the N-BLR transcript and is targeted by members of the miR-200 family In light of these findings we used a microarray to investigate the expression patterns of other pyknon-containing genomic loci We found multiple such loci that are differentially transcribed between healthy and diseased tissues in cancer and chronic lymphocytic Moreover we identified several new loci whose expression correlates with the cancer patients overall survival The primate-specific N-BLR is a novel molecular contributor to the complex mechanisms that underlie metastasis in cancer and a potential novel biomarker for this disease The presence of a functional pyknon within N-BLR and the related finding that many more pyknon-containing genomic loci in the human genome exhibit tissue-specific and disease-specific expression suggests the possibility of an alternative class of biomarkers and therapeutic targets that are primate-specific,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[220, 3097, 4550, 47, 85, 15177, 602, 2111, 4, 435, 60, 22, 583, 74, 309, 17, 491, 1343, 305, 1790, 4, 825, 763, 1849, 78, 29894, 16, 8, 25233, 112, 319, 220, 3097, 893, 17, 5259, 3, 701, 6, 1569, 1970, 4936, 31, 1381, 2, 1106, 12, 578, 21, 173, 331, 318, 1, 74, 29, 100, 306, 736, 1, 12, 7, 2, 514, 17, 3, 4778, 1, 78, 29894, 16, 41, 5, 30, 82, 578, 174, 2, 63, 69, 25, 298, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 2332, 21, 204, 17, 78, 29894, 4936, 1381, 1561, 847, 8119, 5, 563, 2154, 2, 8420, 21, 224, 17, 26, 8119, 16, 517, 20, 8, 36428, 8, 978, 179, 1579, 319, 261, 5298, 3070, 4, 3, 78, 29894, 3268, 2, 16, 238, 20, 1684, 1, 3, 722, 1250, 607, 4, 1691, 1, 46, 272, 21, 95, 8, 1727, 6, 963, 3, 55, 764, 1, 127, 36428, 1101, 572, 2012, 21, 204, 232, 225, 2012, 17, 32, 2478, 10088, 59, 1331, 2, 10486, 742, 4, 12, 2, 442, 1193, 1393, 21, 108, 392, 217, 2012, 1310, 55, 1871, 5, 3, 12, 7, 63, 25, 3, 25233, 112, 78, 29894, 16, 8, 229, 219, 8039, 6, 3, 840, 483, 17, 5875, 278, 4, 12, 2, 8, 174, 229, 901, 9, 26, 34, 3, 463, 1, 8, 583, 36428, 262, 78, 29894, 2, 3, 139, 1567, 17, 445, 80, 36428, 1101, 572, 2012, 4, 3, 171, 898, 2239, 246, 112, 2, 34, 112, 55, 844, 3, 2526, 1, 35, 1091, 1040, 1, 582, 2, 189, 637, 17, 32, 25233, 112]",1679.0,28535802,28
Craniospinal irradiation prior to stem cell transplant for hematologic malignancies with CNS involvement: Effectiveness and toxicity after photon or proton treatment.,Practical radiation oncology,Pract Radiat Oncol,2017-05-10,"Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) improves local control of leukemia/lymphoma with central nervous system (CNS) involvement; however, for adult patients anticipating stem cell transplant (SCT), cumulative treatment toxicity is a major concern. We evaluated toxicities and outcomes for patients receiving proton or photon CSI before SCT. We identified 37 consecutive leukemia/lymphoma patients with CNS involvement who received CSI before SCT at our institution. Photon versus proton toxicities during CSI, transplant, and through 100 days posttransplant were compared using Fisher exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Long-term neurotoxicity, disease response, and overall survival were analyzed. Thirty-seven patients (23 photon, 14 proton) underwent CSI for CNS involvement of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (49%), acute myeloblastic leukemia (22%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (3%), chronic myelocytic leukemia (14%), lymphoma (11%), and myeloma (3%). CSI was used for consolidation (30 patients, 81%) and gross disease treatment (7 patients, 19%). Median radiation dose (interquartile range) was 24 Gy (23.4-24) for photons and 21.8 Gy (21.3-23.6) for protons (P = .03). Proton CSI was associated with lower rates of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 1-3 mucositis during CSI (7% vs 44%, P = .03): 1 grade 3 with protons versus 5 grade 1, 3 grade 2, and 2 grade 3 with photons. During CSI, other toxicities (infection, gastrointestinal symptoms) did not differ. Allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) was used in 95% of patients, with 53% of patients in remission before SCT. Myeloablative conditioning was used for 76%. During SCT admission and 100 days post-SCT, toxicities did not differ by CSI technique. Successful engraftment occurred in 95% of patients (P = .67). Progression or death occurred for 47% of patients, with only 1 CNS relapse. In our cohort, CSI offered excellent local control for CNS-involved hematologic malignancies in the pre-SCT setting.

Risk of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.,International journal of dermatology,Int. J. Dermatol.,2017-07-07,"Second hematologic cancers in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) are well documented and include Hodgkin lymphoma, therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndromes, and transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Although cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) has been reported in patients with CLL, the incidence and comparison to expected rates are unknown. We evaluated the incidence of CTCL among patients with CLL or other non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. We searched the SEER 13 registries for patients with a diagnosis of CLL and NHL between 1992 and 2008. Among patients identified, we evaluated the incidence of CTCL. Among 31,286 patients with CLL, the incidence of CTCL was not significantly higher in men than women: 104.2 (95% CI, 50.0-191.8) and 28.1 (95% CI, 3.4-101.3) per 1,000,000 person-years, respectively (P = 0.06). Among 97,691 patients with NHL, the incidence of CTCL was similar in men and women (97.9 [95% CI, 62.0-146.9] and 92.0 [95% CI, 56.2-142.1] per 1,000,000 person-years, respectively; P = 0.84).

Ibrutinib treatment improves T cell number and function in CLL patients.,The Journal of clinical investigation,J. Clin. Invest.,2017-07-17,"Ibrutinib has been shown to have immunomodulatory effects by inhibiting Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and IL-2-inducible T cell kinase (ITK). The relative importance of inhibiting these 2 kinases has not been examined despite its relevance to immune-based therapies. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients on clinical trials of ibrutinib (BTK/ITK inhibitor; n = 19) or acalabrutinib (selective BTK inhibitor; n = 13) were collected serially. T cell phenotype, immune function, and CLL cell immunosuppressive capacity were evaluated. Ibrutinib markedly increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell numbers in CLL patients. This effect was more prominent in effector/effector memory subsets and was not observed with acalabrutinib. Ex vivo studies demonstrated that this may be due to diminished activation-induced cell death through ITK inhibition. PD-1 and CTLA-4 expression was significantly markedly reduced in T cells by both agents. While the number of Treg cells remained unchanged, the ratio of these to conventional CD4+ T cells was reduced with ibrutinib, but not acalabrutinib. Both agents reduced expression of the immunosuppressive molecules CD200 and BTLA as well as IL-10 production by CLL cells. Ibrutinib treatment increased the in vivo persistence of activated T cells, decreased the Treg/CD4+ T cell ratio, and diminished the immune-suppressive properties of CLL cells through BTK-dependent and -independent mechanisms. These features provide a strong rationale for combination immunotherapy approaches with ibrutinib in CLL and other cancers. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01589302 and NCT02029443.

Durable Molecular Remissions in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treated With CD19-Specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor-Modified T Cells After Failure of Ibrutinib.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2017-07-17,"Purpose We evaluated the safety and feasibility of anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor-modified T (CAR-T) cell therapy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who had previously received ibrutinib. Methods Twenty-four patients with CLL received lymphodepleting chemotherapy and anti-CD19 CAR-T cells at one of three dose levels (2 × 10<sup>5</sup>, 2 × 10<sup>6</sup>, or 2 × 10<sup>7</sup> CAR-T cells/kg). Nineteen patients experienced disease progression while receiving ibrutinib, three were ibrutinib intolerant, and two did not experience progression while receiving ibrutinib. Six patients were venetoclax refractory, and 23 had a complex karyotype and/or 17p deletion. Results Four weeks after CAR-T cell infusion, the overall response rate (complete response [CR] and/or partial response [PR]) by International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) criteria was 71% (17 of 24). Twenty patients (83%) developed cytokine release syndrome, and eight (33%) developed neurotoxicity, which was reversible in all but one patient with a fatal outcome. Twenty of 24 patients received cyclophosphamide and fludarabine lymphodepletion and CD19 CAR-T cells at or below the maximum tolerated dose (≤ 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> CAR-T cells/kg). In 19 of these patients who were restaged, the overall response rate by IWCLL imaging criteria 4 weeks after infusion was 74% (CR, 4/19, 21%; PR, 10/19, 53%), and 15/17 patients (88%) with marrow disease before CAR-T cells had no disease by flow cytometry after CAR-T cells. Twelve of these patients underwent deep IGH sequencing, and seven (58%) had no malignant IGH sequences detected in marrow. Absence of the malignant IGH clone in marrow of patients with CLL who responded by IWCLL criteria was associated with 100% progression-free survival and overall survival (median 6.6 months follow-up) after CAR-T cell immunotherapy. The progression-free survival was similar in patients with lymph node PR or CR by IWCLL criteria. Conclusion CD19 CAR-T cells are highly effective in high-risk patients with CLL after they experience treatment failure with ibrutinib therapy.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",918.0,153.0,Purpose We evaluated the safety and feasibility of anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor-modified T CAR-T cell therapy in patients with chronic lymphocytic CLL who had previously received ibrutinib Methods Twenty-four patients with CLL received lymphodepleting chemotherapy and anti-CD19 CAR-T cells at one of three dose levels 2 10 sup 5 /sup 2 10 sup 6 /sup or 2 10 sup 7 /sup CAR-T cells/kg Nineteen patients experienced disease progression while receiving ibrutinib three were ibrutinib intolerant and two did not experience progression while receiving ibrutinib Six patients were venetoclax refractory and 23 had a complex karyotype and/or 17p deletion Results Four weeks after CAR-T cell infusion the overall response rate complete response CR and/or partial response PR by International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic IWCLL criteria was 71 17 of 24 Twenty patients 83 developed cytokine release syndrome and eight 33 developed neurotoxicity which was reversible in all but one patient with a fatal outcome Twenty of 24 patients received cyclophosphamide and fludarabine lymphodepletion and CD19 CAR-T cells at or below the maximum tolerated dose ≤ 2 10 sup 6 /sup CAR-T cells/kg In 19 of these patients who were restaged the overall response rate by IWCLL imaging criteria 4 weeks after infusion was 74 CR 4/19 21 PR 10/19 53 and 15/17 patients 88 with marrow disease before CAR-T cells had no disease by flow cytometry after CAR-T cells Twelve of these patients underwent deep IGH sequencing and seven 58 had no malignant IGH sequences detected in marrow Absence of the malignant IGH clone in marrow of patients with CLL who responded by IWCLL criteria was associated with 100 progression-free survival and overall survival median 6.6 months follow-up after CAR-T cell immunotherapy The progression-free survival was similar in patients with lymph node PR or CR by IWCLL criteria Conclusion CD19 CAR-T cells are highly effective in high-risk patients with CLL after they experience treatment failure with ibrutinib therapy,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[743, 21, 194, 3, 367, 2, 1437, 1, 312, 3158, 2897, 448, 153, 1230, 102, 1881, 102, 31, 36, 4, 7, 5, 442, 1193, 552, 54, 42, 373, 103, 1795, 636, 737, 294, 7, 5, 552, 103, 36459, 56, 2, 312, 3158, 1881, 102, 37, 28, 104, 1, 169, 61, 148, 18, 79, 172, 33, 172, 18, 79, 172, 49, 172, 15, 18, 79, 172, 67, 172, 1881, 102, 37, 503, 3498, 7, 592, 34, 91, 369, 357, 1795, 169, 11, 1795, 4944, 2, 100, 205, 44, 730, 91, 369, 357, 1795, 437, 7, 11, 4454, 430, 2, 382, 42, 8, 840, 3385, 2, 15, 4135, 1528, 99, 294, 244, 50, 1881, 102, 31, 904, 3, 63, 51, 116, 236, 51, 684, 2, 15, 450, 51, 998, 20, 944, 4014, 23, 442, 1193, 16575, 371, 10, 792, 269, 1, 259, 737, 7, 852, 276, 1675, 2008, 681, 2, 659, 466, 276, 3561, 92, 10, 2786, 4, 62, 84, 104, 69, 5, 8, 3034, 228, 737, 1, 259, 7, 103, 1112, 2, 2027, 16876, 2, 3158, 1881, 102, 37, 28, 15, 2736, 3, 689, 421, 61, 1552, 18, 79, 172, 49, 172, 1881, 102, 37, 503, 4, 326, 1, 46, 7, 54, 11, 15090, 3, 63, 51, 116, 20, 16575, 270, 371, 39, 244, 50, 904, 10, 794, 684, 39, 326, 239, 998, 79, 326, 699, 2, 167, 269, 7, 889, 5, 581, 34, 348, 1881, 102, 37, 42, 77, 34, 20, 1412, 1914, 50, 1881, 102, 37, 2544, 1, 46, 7, 208, 2369, 5221, 615, 2, 648, 717, 42, 77, 393, 5221, 2866, 530, 4, 581, 1127, 1, 3, 393, 5221, 3910, 4, 581, 1, 7, 5, 552, 54, 2211, 20, 16575, 371, 10, 41, 5, 394, 91, 115, 25, 2, 63, 25, 52, 49, 49, 53, 166, 126, 50, 1881, 102, 31, 726, 3, 91, 115, 25, 10, 288, 4, 7, 5, 263, 289, 998, 15, 684, 20, 16575, 371, 1221, 3158, 1881, 102, 37, 32, 561, 323, 4, 64, 43, 7, 5, 552, 50, 491, 730, 24, 496, 5, 1795, 36]",2029.0,28715249,560
Updating survival estimates in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) based on treatment-free interval length.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2017-07-18,"We hypothesized that the length of treatment-free survival following (a) initial diagnosis and (b) first-line treatment would be associated with improved subsequent five-year relative survival (RS5) in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). 19,879 patients incident CLL/SLL cases (median age = 76 years) were identified from SEER-Medicare.

Activation of the B-cell receptor successively activates NF-κB and STAT3 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2017-08-04,"In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, both interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the B-cell receptor (BCR) activate Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and induce the phosphorylation of signal transduction and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) on tyrosine 705 residues. However, whereas IL-6 phosphorylates STAT3 within 15 min, stimulation of the BCR with anti-immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies phosphorylates STAT3 in 2-4 hr. Here, we show that this process takes longer because it requires transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Using an electromobility shift assay, we found that incubation with IgM antibodies for 4 or 18 hr, but not 15 min, increased NF-κB DNA-binding of CLL cells and increased binding was translated to increased transcriptional activity. Hence, 42% of the 83 NF-κB target genes were constitutively expressed in all CLL cells prior to any inducible stimuli. However, activation of the BCR increased the number of NF-κB target genes with detectable expression by 23%. Remarkably, prolonged incubation with anti-IgM antibodies induced a time-dependent transcription, production and secretion of IL-6 protein. The IgM-induced production of IL-6 prompted the phosphorylation of STAT3 on tyrosine residues. This effect was inhibited by the JAK1/2 inhibitor of the JAK/STAT3 pathway ruxolitinib. Taken together, these results suggest that in CLL cells, constitutive tonic activation of NF-κB can be further enhanced by the BCR and that the BCR-induced activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway depends on the NF-κB induced production of IL-6.",Journal Article,900.0,7.0,In chronic lymphocytic CLL cells both interleukin-6 IL-6 and the B-cell receptor BCR activate Janus kinase 2 JAK2 and induce the phosphorylation of signal transduction and activator of transcription 3 STAT3 on tyrosine 705 residues However whereas IL-6 phosphorylates STAT3 within 15 min stimulation of the BCR with anti-immunoglobulin M IgM antibodies phosphorylates STAT3 in 2-4 hr Here we show that this process takes longer because it requires transcriptional activity of NF-κB Using an electromobility shift assay we found that incubation with IgM antibodies for 4 or 18 hr but not 15 min increased NF-κB DNA-binding of CLL cells and increased binding was translated to increased transcriptional activity Hence 42 of the 83 NF-κB target genes were constitutively expressed in all CLL cells prior to any inducible stimuli However activation of the BCR increased the number of NF-κB target genes with detectable expression by 23 Remarkably prolonged incubation with anti-IgM antibodies induced a time-dependent transcription production and secretion of IL-6 protein The IgM-induced production of IL-6 prompted the phosphorylation of STAT3 on tyrosine residues This effect was inhibited by the JAK1/2 inhibitor of the JAK/STAT3 pathway ruxolitinib Taken together these results suggest that in CLL cells constitutive tonic activation of NF-κB can be further enhanced by the BCR and that the BCR-induced activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway depends on the NF-κB induced production of IL-6,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[4, 442, 1193, 552, 37, 110, 1603, 49, 501, 49, 2, 3, 132, 31, 153, 1062, 2977, 6191, 216, 18, 2509, 2, 1290, 3, 982, 1, 1235, 2761, 2, 3393, 1, 866, 27, 1439, 23, 564, 11303, 6418, 137, 547, 501, 49, 12528, 1439, 262, 167, 1538, 2503, 1, 3, 1062, 5, 312, 2593, 188, 2852, 890, 12528, 1439, 4, 18, 39, 168, 467, 21, 514, 17, 26, 1129, 8512, 589, 408, 192, 1706, 1431, 128, 1, 1365, 2448, 75, 35, 28011, 3024, 719, 21, 204, 17, 7797, 5, 2852, 890, 9, 39, 15, 203, 168, 84, 44, 167, 1538, 101, 1365, 2448, 261, 791, 1, 552, 37, 2, 101, 791, 10, 5136, 6, 101, 1431, 128, 3665, 595, 1, 3, 852, 1365, 2448, 283, 214, 11, 2818, 570, 4, 62, 552, 37, 324, 6, 500, 2877, 7478, 137, 363, 1, 3, 1062, 101, 3, 207, 1, 1365, 2448, 283, 214, 5, 2083, 55, 20, 382, 4856, 1069, 7797, 5, 312, 2852, 890, 277, 8, 98, 470, 866, 1529, 2, 2935, 1, 501, 49, 178, 3, 2852, 277, 1529, 1, 501, 49, 4140, 3, 982, 1, 1439, 23, 564, 6418, 26, 254, 10, 879, 20, 3, 8075, 18, 230, 1, 3, 4653, 1439, 308, 4894, 1633, 1162, 46, 99, 309, 17, 4, 552, 37, 3178, 26644, 363, 1, 1365, 2448, 122, 40, 195, 651, 20, 3, 1062, 2, 17, 3, 1062, 277, 363, 1, 3, 4653, 1439, 308, 3828, 23, 3, 1365, 2448, 277, 1529, 1, 501, 49]",1487.0,28722170,576
Time to Second-line Treatment and Subsequent Relative Survival in Older Patients With Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma.,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2017-07-19,"Novel targeted therapies offer excellent short-term outcomes in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). However, there is disagreement over how widely these therapies should be used in place of standard chemo-immunotherapy (CIT). We investigated whether stratification on the length of the interval between first-line (T1) and second-line (T2) treatments could identify a subgroup of older patients with relapsed CLL/SLL with an expectation of normal overall survival, and for whom CIT could be an acceptable treatment choice. Patients with relapsed CLL/SLL who received T2 were identified from the SEER-Medicare Linked Database. Five-year relative survival (RS5; ie, the ratio of observed survival to expected survival based on population life tables) was assessed after stratifying patients on the interval between T1 and T2. We then validated our findings in the Mayo Clinic CLL Database. Among 1974 SEER-Medicare patients (median age = 77 years) who received T2 for relapsed CLL/SLL, longer time-to-retreatment was associated with a modestly improved prognosis (P = .01). However, even among those retreated ≥ 3 years after T1, survival was poor compared with the general population (RS5 = 0.50 or lower in SEER-Medicare). Similar patterns were observed in the younger Mayo validation cohort, although prognosis was better overall among the Mayo patients, and patients with favorable fluorescence in situ hybridization retreated ≥ 3 years after T1 had close to normal expected survival (RS5 = 0.87).

B-cell Receptor Signaling Regulates Metabolism in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.,Molecular cancer research : MCR,Mol. Cancer Res.,2017-08-23,"Peripheral blood chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells are quiescent but have active transcription and translation processes, suggesting that these lymphocytes are metabolically active. Based on this premise, the metabolic phenotype of CLL lymphocytes was investigated by evaluating the two intracellular ATP-generating pathways. Metabolic flux was assessed by measuring glycolysis as extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation as oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and then correlated with prognostic factors. Further, the impact of B-cell receptor signaling (BCR) on metabolism was determined by genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibitors. Compared with proliferative B-cell lines, metabolic fluxes of oxygen and lactate were low in CLL cells. ECAR was consistently low, but OCR varied considerably in human patient samples (<i>n</i> = 45). Higher OCR was associated with poor prognostic factors such as ZAP 70 positivity, unmutated IGHV, high β2M levels, and higher Rai stage. Consistent with the association of ZAP 70 and IGHV unmutated status with active BCR signaling, genetic ablation of BCR mitigated OCR in malignant B cells. Similarly, knocking out PI3Kδ, a critical component of the BCR pathway, decreased OCR and ECAR. In concert, PI3K pathway inhibitors dramatically reduced OCR and ECAR. In harmony with a decline in metabolic activity, the ribonucleotide pools in CLL cells were reduced with duvelisib treatment. Collectively, these data demonstrate that CLL metabolism, especially OCR, is linked to prognostic factors and is curbed by BCR and PI3K pathway inhibition.<b>Implications:</b> This study identifies a relationship between oxidative phosphorylation in CLL and prognostic factors providing a rationale to therapeutically target these processes. <i>Mol Cancer Res; 15(12); 1692-703. ©2017 AACR</i>.",Journal Article,881.0,10.0,Peripheral blood chronic lymphocytic CLL cells are quiescent but have active transcription and translation processes suggesting that these lymphocytes are metabolically active Based on this premise the metabolic phenotype of CLL lymphocytes was investigated by evaluating the two intracellular ATP-generating pathways Metabolic flux was assessed by measuring glycolysis as extracellular acidification rate ECAR and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation as oxygen consumption rate OCR and then correlated with prognostic factors Further the impact of B-cell receptor signaling BCR on metabolism was determined by genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibitors Compared with proliferative B-cell lines metabolic fluxes of oxygen and lactate were low in CLL cells ECAR was consistently low but OCR varied considerably in human patient samples i n /i 45 Higher OCR was associated with poor prognostic factors such as ZAP 70 positivity unmutated IGHV high β2M levels and higher Rai stage Consistent with the association of ZAP 70 and IGHV unmutated status with active BCR signaling genetic ablation of BCR mitigated OCR in malignant B cells Similarly knocking out PI3Kδ a critical component of the BCR pathway decreased OCR and ECAR In concert PI3K pathway inhibitors dramatically reduced OCR and ECAR In harmony with a decline in metabolic activity the ribonucleotide pools in CLL cells were reduced with duvelisib treatment Collectively these data demonstrate that CLL metabolism especially OCR is linked to prognostic factors and is curbed by BCR and PI3K pathway inhibition. b Implications /b This study identifies a relationship between oxidative phosphorylation in CLL and prognostic factors providing a rationale to therapeutically target these processes i Mol Cancer Res 15 12 1692-703 ©2017 AACR /i,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[672, 315, 442, 1193, 552, 37, 32, 6735, 84, 47, 544, 866, 2, 2691, 1849, 802, 17, 46, 1594, 32, 10392, 544, 90, 23, 26, 14448, 3, 1436, 1005, 1, 552, 1594, 10, 565, 20, 1435, 3, 100, 2087, 3918, 3997, 460, 1436, 9876, 10, 275, 20, 2978, 4484, 22, 1976, 18340, 116, 36469, 2, 2019, 3495, 982, 22, 2848, 2421, 116, 20885, 2, 818, 438, 5, 177, 130, 195, 3, 345, 1, 132, 31, 153, 314, 1062, 23, 1600, 10, 509, 20, 336, 1650, 2, 3419, 222, 72, 5, 2441, 132, 31, 285, 1436, 37580, 1, 2848, 2, 3330, 11, 154, 4, 552, 37, 36469, 10, 2433, 154, 84, 20885, 2051, 5597, 4, 171, 69, 347, 70, 78, 70, 512, 142, 20885, 10, 41, 5, 334, 177, 130, 225, 22, 6251, 431, 1887, 7216, 6220, 64, 27019, 148, 2, 142, 4121, 82, 925, 5, 3, 248, 1, 6251, 431, 2, 6220, 7216, 156, 5, 544, 1062, 314, 336, 1650, 1, 1062, 10042, 20885, 4, 393, 132, 37, 1813, 12875, 1205, 11063, 8, 740, 1249, 1, 3, 1062, 308, 340, 20885, 2, 36469, 4, 10562, 974, 308, 222, 2729, 405, 20885, 2, 36469, 4, 48060, 5, 8, 1858, 4, 1436, 128, 3, 7050, 9090, 4, 552, 37, 11, 405, 5, 15080, 24, 2535, 46, 74, 608, 17, 552, 1600, 1093, 20885, 16, 1199, 6, 177, 130, 2, 16, 34389, 20, 1062, 2, 974, 308, 297, 132, 1268, 132, 26, 45, 2953, 8, 858, 59, 3495, 982, 4, 552, 2, 177, 130, 1736, 8, 1728, 6, 4602, 283, 46, 1849, 70, 5824, 12, 1936, 167, 133, 71074, 15273, 3194, 1630, 70]",1805.0,28835371,473
The Stromal Microenvironment Modulates Mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Cells.,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",Neoplasia,2017-08-30,"Peripheral blood chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells are replicationally quiescent mature B-cells. In short-term cultures, supporting stromal cells provide a survival advantage to CLL cells by inducing transcription and translation without promoting proliferation. We hypothesized that the stromal microenvironment augments malignant B cells' metabolism to enable the cells to cope with their energy demands for transcription and translation. We used extracellular flux analysis to assess the two major energy-generating pathways, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) and glycolysis, in primary CLL cells in the presence of three different stromal cell lines. OxPhos, measured as the basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and maximum respiration capacity, was significantly higher in 28 patients' CLL cells cocultured with bone marrow-derived NK.Tert stromal cells than in CLL cells cultured alone (P = .004 and <.0001, respectively). Similar OCR induction was observed in CLL cells cocultured with M2-10B4 and HS-5 stromal lines. In contrast, heterogeneous changes in the extracellular acidification rate (a measure of glycolysis) were observed in CLL cells cocultured with stromal cells. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of CLL cells' metabolomics profile indicated stroma-mediated stimulation of nucleotide synthesis.

"Liver dysfunction in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Prevalence, outcomes, and pathological findings.",American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2017-10-19,"The prevalence of liver dysfunction and its association with outcomes in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is unknown. Newly diagnosed (<12 months) previously untreated CLL patients seen at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN between 9/1993 and 4/2016 who had baseline assessment of at least one liver function test (LFT) were included in this analysis. The prevalence of liver dysfunction at baseline, proportion of patients who acquired LFT abnormalities, time to first therapy (TTFT) and overall survival (OS) were assessed. An abnormal LFT was present in 82/2336 (3.5%) patients at diagnosis and was associated with advanced Rai stage (Rai III-IV) (21% vs. 6%; P < .001), lower hemoglobin (13.1 g/dL vs. 13.9 g/dL; P < .001), and lower platelet count (187 × 109/L vs. 200 × 109/L; P = .03). Additionally, 236 patients with normal LFTs at diagnosis developed acquired liver dysfunction during follow-up. Patients with abnormal LFTs at diagnosis had a shorter OS compared to those with normal LFTs (HR 1.80 95% CI 1.13-2.87; P = .014, adjusted for age, sex, Rai stage, and treatment), although TTFT was not different. Of 52 patients who underwent a liver biopsy, CLL was present in liver tissue in 39/52 (73%) patients, with the portal tracts the most common region involved. Histopathology findings of liver involvement by CLL had limited correlation with choice of CLL therapy. In conclusion, approximately 1 of 25 newly diagnosed CLL patients has abnormal LFTs at diagnosis.

"Building a Safer and Faster CAR: Seatbelts, Airbags, and CRISPR.",Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2017-10-13,"Therapeutic T cell engineering has recently garnered widespread interest because of the success of CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy. CARs are synthetic receptors for antigen that redirect the specificity and reprogram the function of the T cells in which they are genetically introduced. CARs targeting CD19, a cell surface molecule found in most leukemias and lymphomas, have yielded high remission rates in patients with chemorefractory, relapsed disease, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The toxicities of this treatment include B cell aplasia, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and neurotoxicity.

Assessment of Impact of HLA Type on Outcomes of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2017-10-12,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a common hematologic malignancy with many highly effective therapies. Chemorefractory disease, often characterized by deletion of chromosome 17p, has historically been associated with very poor outcomes, leading to the application of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) for medically fit patients. Although the use of allo-HCT has declined since the introduction of novel targeted therapy for the treatment of CLL, there remains significant interest in understanding factors that may influence the efficacy of allo-HCT, the only known curative treatment for CLL. The potential benefit of transplantation is most likely due to the presence of alloreactive donor T cells that mediate the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. The recognition of potentially tumor-specific antigens in the context of class I and II major histocompatibility complex on malignant B lymphocytes by donor T cells may be influenced by subtle differences in the highly polymorphic HLA locus. Given previous reports of specific HLA alleles impacting the incidence of CLL and the clinical outcomes of allo-HCT for CLL, we sought to study the overall survival and progression-free survival of a large cohort of patients with CLL who underwent allo-HCT from fully HLA-matched related and unrelated donors at Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research transplantation centers. We found no statistically significant association of allo-HCT outcomes in CLL based on previously reported HLA combinations.

This phase 1 study evaluated maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (PD), efficacy, and safety of duvelisib in 210 patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. In the dose escalation phase (n = 31), duvelisib 8 to 100 mg twice daily was administered, with MTD determined as 75 mg twice daily. In the expansion phase (n = 179), patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), or T-cell lymphoma (TCL) were treated with 25 or 75 mg duvelisib twice daily continuously. Single-dose duvelisib was rapidly absorbed (time to maximum concentration, 1-2 hours), with a half-life of 5.2 to 10.9 hours. PD results showed inhibition of phospho-AKT (S473) in CLL tumor cells following a single dose and near-complete inhibition of CLL proliferation (Ki-67) by cycle 2. Clinical responses were seen across a range of doses and disease subtypes: iNHL overall response rate, 58% (n = 31) with 6 complete responses (CRs); relapsed/refractory CLL, 56% (n = 55) with 1 CR; peripheral TCL, 50% (n = 16) with 3 CR; and cutaneous TCL, 32% (n = 19). Median time to response was ∼1.8 months.

"Venetoclax for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia progressing after ibrutinib: an interim analysis of a multicentre, open-label, phase 2 trial.",The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2017-12-12,"Therapy targeting Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) with ibrutinib has transformed the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. However, patients who are refractory to or relapse after ibrutinib therapy have poor outcomes. Venetoclax is a selective, orally bioavailable inhibitor of BCL-2 active in previously treated patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. In this study, we assessed the activity and safety of venetoclax in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who are refractory to or relapse during or after ibrutinib therapy. In this interim analysis of a multicentre, open-label, non-randomised, phase 2 trial, we enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with a documented diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia according to the 2008 International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) criteria and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 2 or lower. All patients had relapsed or refractory disease after previous treatment with a BCR signalling pathway inhibitor. All patients were screened for Richter's transformation and cases confirmed by biopsy were excluded. Eligible patients received oral venetoclax, starting at 20 mg per day with stepwise dose ramp-up over 5 weeks to 400 mg per day. Patients with rapidly progressing disease received an accelerated dosing schedule (to 400 mg per day by week 3). The primary endpoint was overall response, defined as the proportion of patients with an overall response per investigator's assessment according to IWCLL criteria. All patients who received at least one dose of venetoclax were included in the activity and safety analyses. This study is ongoing; data for this interim analysis were collected per regulatory agencies' request as of June 30, 2017. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02141282. Between September, 2014, and November, 2016, 127 previously treated patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were enrolled from 15 sites across the USA. 91 patients had received ibrutinib as the last BCR inhibitor therapy before enrolment, 43 of whom were enrolled in the main cohort and 48 in the expansion cohort recruited later after a protocol amendment. At the time of analysis, the median follow-up was 14 months (IQR 8-18) for all 91 patients, 19 months (9-27) for the main cohort, and 12 months (8-15) for the expansion cohort. 59 (65%, 95% CI 53-74) of 91 patients had an overall response, including 30 (70%, 54-83) of 43 patients in the main cohort and 29 (60%, 43-72) of 48 patients in the expansion cohort. The most common treatment-emergent grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (46 [51%] of 91 patients), thrombocytopenia (26 [29%]), anaemia (26 [29%]), decreased white blood cell count (17 [19%]), and decreased lymphocyte count (14 [15%]). 17 (19%) of 91 patients died, including seven because of disease progression. No treatment-related deaths occurred. The results of this interim analysis show that venetoclax has durable clinical activity and favourable tolerability in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia whose disease progressed during or after discontinutation of ibrutinib therapy. The durability of response to venetoclax will be assessed in the final analysis in 2019.

Cytokine release syndrome after radiation therapy: case report and review of the literature.,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,J Immunother Cancer,2018-01-03,"Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) has been reported after immunologic manipulations, most often through therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. To our knowledge, CRS after radiation therapy (RT) for cancer has not been reported before.

A 65 year-old man with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia and recurrent, metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma undergoing anti-programmed death 1 (PD1) immunotherapy was referred for palliative RT to sites of progressing metastases. Within hours of each weekly dose of RT, he experienced fever, tachycardia, hypotension, rash, dyspnea, and rigors. Based on clinical suspicion for CRS, blood cytokine measurements were performed 1 h after the second and third dose of RT and demonstrated tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels approximately ten-fold higher than normal. These were near normal immediately prior to the third dose of RT, and resolved to normal levels 3 weeks after RT. He experienced rapid regression of irradiated tumors, with development of new sites of metastases soon thereafter. A literature review revealed no clinical cases of CRS after RT for cancer. RT during anti-PD1 immunotherapy in a patient with underlying immune dysfunction appeared to be the putative mediator of an immune process which yielded significant increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines, and produced the clinical symptoms meeting the definition of grade 3 CRS.

Functional and clinical relevance of VLA-4 (CD49d/CD29) in ibrutinib-treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,The Journal of experimental medicine,J. Exp. Med.,2018-01-04,"The Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib, which antagonizes B cell receptor (BCR) signals, demonstrates remarkable clinical activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The lymphocytosis experienced by most patients under ibrutinib has previously been attributed to inhibition of BTK-dependent integrin and chemokine cues operating to retain the tumor cells in nodal compartments. Here, we show that the VLA-4 integrin, as expressed by CD49d-positive CLL, can be inside-out activated upon BCR triggering, thus reinforcing the adhesive capacities of CLL cells. In vitro and in vivo ibrutinib treatment, although reducing the constitutive VLA-4 activation and cell adhesion, can be overcome by exogenous BCR triggering in a BTK-independent manner involving PI3K.

Venetoclax for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who progressed during or after idelalisib therapy.,Blood,Blood,2018-01-05,"B-cell receptor pathway inhibitors (BCRis) have transformed treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); however, the efficacy of therapies for patients whose disease is refractory to/relapses after (R/R) BCRis is unknown. Venetoclax is a selective, orally bioavailable BCL-2 inhibitor with activity in patients with CLL, including those who are heavily pretreated or have 17p deletion. This phase 2 study prospectively evaluated venetoclax in patients with R/R CLL after ibrutinib or idelalisib; here we report on patients who received idelalisib as the last BCRi before enrollment. Venetoclax was initiated at 20 mg daily, followed by intrapatient ramp-up to 400 mg daily. Primary objectives included efficacy (objective response rate [ORR]) and safety of venetoclax. The study enrolled 36 patients who previously received idelalisib (ORR, 67% [24/36]); 2 patients achieved complete remission, and 1 had complete remission with incomplete bone marrow recovery. Median progression-free survival (PFS) has not yet been reached; estimated 12-month PFS was 79%. The most common adverse events (AEs; all grades) were neutropenia (56%), diarrhea (42%), upper respiratory tract infection (39%), thrombocytopenia (36%), nausea (31%), fatigue (28%), cough (22%), rash (22%), and anemia (22%). Grade 3 or 4 AEs were primarily hematologic (neutropenia [50%], thrombocytopenia [25%], and anemia [17%]). No patients experienced tumor lysis syndrome.

The most frequently mutated gene was <i>SF3B1</i> (15%), followed by <i>NOTCH1</i> (14%) and <i>TP53</i> (14%), with R/R patients having significantly more <i>TP53</i> mutations than did TN patients. Among all lenalidomide-treated patients, del(17p) (<i>P</i> ≤ .001), del(11q) (<i>P</i> = .032), and complex karyotype (<i>P</i> = .022), along with mutations in <i>TP53</i> (<i>P</i> ≤ .001), <i>KRAS</i> (<i>P</i> = .034), and <i>DDX3X</i> (<i>P</i> ≤ .001), were associated with worse overall response (OR). R/R patients with <i>SF3B1</i> and <i>MGA</i> mutations had significantly worse OR (<i>P</i> = .025 and .035, respectively). TN and R/R patients with del(17p) and <i>TP53</i> mutations had worse overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). In R/R patients, complex karyotype and <i>SF3B1</i> mutations were associated with worse OS and PFS; <i>DDX3X</i> mutations were associated with worse PFS only. Weibull regression multivariate analysis revealed that <i>TP53</i> aberrations (del(17p), <i>TP53</i> mutation, or both), along with complex karyotype and <i>SF3B1</i> mutations, were associated with worse OS in the R/R cohort.

"BRD4 Profiling Identifies Critical Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Oncogenic Circuits and Reveals Sensitivity to PLX51107, a Novel Structurally Distinct BET Inhibitor.",Cancer discovery,Cancer Discov,2018-01-31,"Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family proteins are key regulators of gene expression in cancer. Herein, we utilize BRD4 profiling to identify critical pathways involved in pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). BRD4 is overexpressed in CLL and is enriched proximal to genes upregulated or <i>de novo</i> expressed in CLL with known functions in disease pathogenesis and progression. These genes, including key members of the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway, provide a rationale for this therapeutic approach to identify new targets in alternative types of cancer. Additionally, we describe PLX51107, a structurally distinct BET inhibitor with novel <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> pharmacologic properties that emulates or exceeds the efficacy of BCR signaling agents in preclinical models of CLL. Herein, the discovery of the involvement of BRD4 in the core CLL transcriptional program provides a compelling rationale for clinical investigation of PLX51107 as epigenetic therapy in CLL and application of BRD4 profiling in other cancers.<b>Significance:</b> To date, functional studies of BRD4 in CLL are lacking. Through integrated genomic, functional, and pharmacologic analyses, we uncover the existence of BRD4-regulated core CLL transcriptional programs and present preclinical proof-of-concept studies validating BET inhibition as an epigenetic approach to target BCR signaling in CLL. <i>Cancer Discov; 8(4); 458-77. ©2018 AACR.</i><i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 371</i>.",Journal Article,720.0,22.0,Bromodomain and extra-terminal BET family proteins are key regulators of gene expression in cancer Herein we utilize BRD4 profiling to identify critical pathways involved in pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic CLL BRD4 is overexpressed in CLL and is enriched proximal to genes upregulated or i de novo /i expressed in CLL with known functions in disease pathogenesis and progression These genes including key members of the B-cell receptor BCR signaling pathway provide a rationale for this therapeutic approach to identify new targets in alternative types of cancer Additionally we describe PLX51107 a structurally distinct BET inhibitor with novel i in vitro /i and i in vivo /i pharmacologic properties that emulates or exceeds the efficacy of BCR signaling agents in preclinical models of CLL Herein the discovery of the involvement of BRD4 in the core CLL transcriptional program provides a compelling rationale for clinical investigation of PLX51107 as epigenetic therapy in CLL and application of BRD4 profiling in other cancers. b Significance /b To date functional studies of BRD4 in CLL are lacking Through integrated genomic functional and pharmacologic analyses we uncover the existence of BRD4-regulated core CLL transcriptional programs and present preclinical proof-of-concept studies validating BET inhibition as an epigenetic approach to target BCR signaling in CLL i Cancer Discov 8 4 458-77 ©2018 AACR. /i i This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature p. 371 /i,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[7904, 2, 3420, 2158, 4661, 607, 652, 32, 825, 3196, 1, 145, 55, 4, 12, 1986, 21, 6391, 8141, 1080, 6, 255, 740, 460, 646, 4, 1384, 1, 442, 1193, 552, 8141, 16, 1711, 4, 552, 2, 16, 2220, 2805, 6, 214, 2684, 15, 70, 1566, 2018, 70, 570, 4, 552, 5, 440, 1681, 4, 34, 1384, 2, 91, 46, 214, 141, 825, 1684, 1, 3, 132, 31, 153, 1062, 314, 308, 377, 8, 1728, 9, 26, 189, 353, 6, 255, 217, 637, 4, 1091, 630, 1, 12, 1724, 21, 897, 50845, 8, 8533, 834, 4661, 230, 5, 229, 70, 4, 439, 70, 2, 70, 4, 386, 70, 2788, 1571, 17, 50846, 15, 9956, 3, 209, 1, 1062, 314, 183, 4, 693, 274, 1, 552, 1986, 3, 1574, 1, 3, 799, 1, 8141, 4, 3, 1793, 552, 1431, 1243, 777, 8, 6051, 1728, 9, 38, 940, 1, 50845, 22, 1418, 36, 4, 552, 2, 1581, 1, 8141, 1080, 4, 127, 163, 132, 724, 132, 6, 1244, 583, 94, 1, 8141, 4, 552, 32, 1941, 298, 2102, 572, 583, 2, 2788, 318, 21, 6281, 3, 5335, 1, 8141, 1065, 1793, 552, 1431, 2251, 2, 364, 693, 3840, 1, 2545, 94, 6897, 4661, 297, 22, 35, 1418, 353, 6, 283, 1062, 314, 4, 552, 70, 12, 7183, 66, 39, 12072, 849, 4281, 1630, 70, 70, 26, 946, 16, 3681, 4, 3, 4, 26, 2537, 2705, 19, 9196, 70]",1493.0,29386193,221
Single-agent ibrutinib in treatment-naïve and relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a 5-year experience.,Blood,Blood,2018-02-02,"We previously reported durable responses and manageable safety of ibrutinib from a 3-year follow-up of treatment-naïve (TN) older patients (≥65 years of age) and relapsed/refractory (R/R) patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). We now report on long-term efficacy and safety with median follow-up of 5 years in this patient population with TN (N = 31) and R/R (N = 101) CLL/SLL. With the current 5-year follow-up, ibrutinib continues to yield a high overall response rate of 89%, with complete response rates increasing over time to 29% in TN patients and 10% in R/R patients. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached in TN patients. The 5-year PFS rate was 92% in TN patients and 44% in R/R patients. Median PFS in R/R patients was 51 months; in those with del(11q), del(17p), and unmutated <i>IGHV</i>, it was 51, 26, and 43 months, respectively, demonstrating long-term efficacy of ibrutinib in some high-risk subgroups. Survival outcomes were less robust for R/R patients with del(17p) and those who received more prior therapies. The onset of grade ≥3 cytopenias, such as neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, decreased over time. Treatment--limiting adverse events were more frequent during the first year compared with subsequent periods. These results demonstrate sustained efficacy and acceptable tolerability of ibrutinib over an extended time, providing the longest experience for Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment in patients with CLL/SLL.

Prognostic Factors for Complete Response to Ibrutinib in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia: A Pooled Analysis of 2 Clinical Trials.,JAMA oncology,JAMA Oncol,2018-05-01,"Ibrutinib, a first-in-class Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor taken once daily, is approved in the United States for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and allows for treatment without chemotherapy. Extended treatment with ibrutinib has demonstrated increased complete response (CR) rates over time. To analyze baseline factors that predict CR in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma treated with ibrutinib. Univariate and multivariate analyses of pooled data from 2 clinical trials were used to assess the prognostic value of baseline factors associated with CR in 327 patients from the PCYC-1102 and PCYC-1112 studies treated with single-agent ibrutinib. Participants were followed up in academic and community medical centers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Italy, Ireland, Poland, Spain, and Austria. Odds ratio (OR) of CR rate. The 327 patients included in this analysis had a median age of 67 years (range, 30-86 years) and 227 (69.4%) were male. At baseline, 185 patients (56.6%) had bulky disease (lymph node ≥5 cm), 184 (56.3%) had advanced-stage disease, and 182 (55.7%) had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or higher. Thirty-one patients (9.5%) were in the first-line setting; 38 (11.6%) had undergone 1 previous therapy, 81 (24.8%) had undergone 2, and 177 (54.1%) had undergone 3 or more; patients with relapsed/refractory disease had undergone a median of 3 (range, 0-12) previous therapies. Median time on study was 26.4 months (range, 0.3-55.6 months). Thirty-two of the 327 patients (9.8%) treated with ibrutinib had a CR (PCYC-1102: relapsed/refractory, 12 of 101 [11.9%]; treatment-naive, 8 of 31 [25.8%]; and PCYC-1112: 12 of 195 [6.2%]). The median time to CR for these patients was 14.7 months (range, 4.6-47.1 months). Univariate analysis of baseline factors showed that bulky disease, clinical stage, number of previous therapies, and β2-microglobulin concentration had a significant effect on the odds of CR.

Prognostic Factors in the Era of Targeted Therapies in CLL.,Current hematologic malignancy reports,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,2018-04-01,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is heterogeneous disease characterized by a variable clinical course that is greatly influenced by various patient and disease characteristics. Over the last two decades, advent of new diagnostic methodologies has led to the identification of several factors of prognostic and predictive relevance. Furthermore, recent advances in next-generation sequencing techniques has identified recurrent novel mutations in NOTCH1, SF3B1, BIRC3, and ATM genes whose role as prognostic and predictive markers is currently being investigated. These biologic markers carry new prognostic information and their incorporation into prognostic scoring systems will likely lead to refined multi-parameter risk models. While the prognostic impact of many of the most commonly used markers on clinical outcomes in patients treated with chemo-immunotherapy is well documented, it is important to review their predictive and prognostic role in the era of novel targeted therapies.

Accelerating drug development in pediatric cancer: a novel Phase I study design of venetoclax in relapsed/refractory malignancies.,"Future oncology (London, England)",Future Oncol,2018-03-29,"Venetoclax is a highly selective, potent BCL-2 inhibitor that is approved for some patients previously treated for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and has shown promising activity in adult studies across several hematologic malignancies. Preclinical studies have demonstrated venetoclax activity in pediatric patient-derived xenograft models and cell lines; however, clinical studies in pediatric patients have yet to be conducted. The prognosis is poor for children with most relapsed/refractory malignancies, and limited treatment options result in unmet clinical need.

Frequency and impact of grade three or four toxicities of novel agents on outcomes of older patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (alliance A151611).,Journal of geriatric oncology,J Geriatr Oncol,2018-04-17,"Older patients with cancer suffer from chemotherapy-related toxicities more frequently than younger patients. As novel agents are being used more commonly in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), toxicities of these agents in older patients have not been well studied. Further, impact of these toxicities on outcomes in the elderly is unknown. This study aimed to answer both questions. We reviewed 14 Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology trials that enrolled CLL and/or NHL patients between 2004-2014. Toxicity was assessed per the NCI-CTCAE (version 3-5). Probabilities of experiencing grade three or four hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities were modeled as a function of clinical and disease-related factors using logistic regression. 1199 patients (409 age ≥ 65; 790 age < 65) were analyzed; 438 received only biologic therapy (145 age ≥ 65; 293 age < 65), and 761 received biologic + chemotherapy (264 age ≥ 65; 497 age < 65). The odds of grade three or four hematologic [odds ratio (OR) 1.70; p = 0.009: 95% CI (1.57-1.84)] and non-hematologic toxicities [OR 1.47; p = 0.022; 95% CI (1.39-1.55)] were increased in older patients with CLL, as well as odds of grade three or four non-hematologic toxicities [OR 1.89; p = 0.017; 95% CI (1.64-2.17)] in older patients with NHL. Grade three or four hematologic toxicities were associated with inferior OS and PFS in older patients with NHL [HR 3.14; p = 0.006; 95% CI (2.25-4.39) for OS and 3.06; p = 0.011; 95% CI (2.10-4.45) for PFS], though not in CLL.

Association of polygenic risk score with the risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis.,Blood,Blood,2018-04-19,"Inherited loci have been found to be associated with risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). A combined polygenic risk score (PRS) of representative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from these loci may improve risk prediction over individual SNPs. Herein, we evaluated the association of a PRS with CLL risk and its precursor, monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). We assessed its validity and discriminative ability in an independent sample and evaluated effect modification and confounding by family history (FH) of hematological cancers. For discovery, we pooled genotype data on 41 representative SNPs from 1499 CLL and 2459 controls from the InterLymph Consortium. For validation, we used data from 1267 controls from Mayo Clinic and 201 CLL, 95 MBL, and 144 controls with a FH of CLL from the Genetic Epidemiology of CLL Consortium. We used odds ratios (ORs) to estimate disease associations with PRS and c-statistics to assess discriminatory accuracy. In InterLymph, the continuous PRS was strongly associated with CLL risk (OR, 2.49; <i>P</i> = 4.4 × 10<sup>-94</sup>). We replicated these findings in the Genetic Epidemiology of CLL Consortium and Mayo controls (OR, 3.02; <i>P</i> = 7.8 × 10<sup>-30</sup>) and observed high discrimination (c-statistic = 0.78). When jointly modeled with FH, PRS retained its significance, along with FH status. Finally, we found a highly significant association of the continuous PRS with MBL risk (OR, 2.81; <i>P</i> = 9.8 × 10<sup>-16</sup>).

Novel role of prostate apoptosis response-4 tumor suppressor in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2018-04-25,"Prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4), a proapoptotic tumor suppressor protein, is downregulated in many cancers including renal cell carcinoma, glioblastoma, endometrial, and breast cancer. Par-4 induces apoptosis selectively in various types of cancer cells but not normal cells. We found that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells from human patients and from Eµ-Tcl1 mice constitutively express Par-4 in greater amounts than normal B-1 or B-2 cells. Interestingly, knockdown of Par-4 in human CLL-derived Mec-1 cells results in a robust increase in p21/WAF1 expression and decreased growth due to delayed G1-to-S cell-cycle transition. Lack of Par-4 also increased the expression of p21 and delayed CLL growth in Eμ-Tcl1 mice. Par-4 expression in CLL cells required constitutively active B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, as inhibition of BCR signaling with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs caused a decrease in Par-4 messenger RNA and protein, and an increase in apoptosis. In particular, activities of Lyn, a Src family kinase, spleen tyrosine kinase, and Bruton tyrosine kinase are required for Par-4 expression in CLL cells, suggesting a novel regulation of Par-4 through BCR signaling. Together, these results suggest that Par-4 may play a novel progrowth rather than proapoptotic role in CLL and could be targeted to enhance the therapeutic effects of BCR-signaling inhibitors.",Journal Article,636.0,3.0,apoptosis response-4 Par-4 a proapoptotic tumor suppressor protein is downregulated in many cancers including cell carcinoma glioblastoma and cancer Par-4 induces apoptosis selectively in various types of cancer cells but not normal cells We found that chronic lymphocytic CLL cells from human patients and from Eµ-Tcl1 mice constitutively express Par-4 in greater amounts than normal B-1 or B-2 cells Interestingly knockdown of Par-4 in human CLL-derived Mec-1 cells results in a robust increase in p21/WAF1 expression and decreased growth due to delayed G1-to-S cell-cycle transition Lack of Par-4 also increased the expression of p21 and delayed CLL growth in Eμ-Tcl1 mice Par-4 expression in CLL cells required constitutively active B-cell receptor BCR signaling as inhibition of BCR signaling with US Food and Drug Administration FDA -approved drugs caused a decrease in Par-4 messenger RNA and protein and an increase in apoptosis In particular activities of Lyn a Src family kinase spleen tyrosine kinase and Bruton tyrosine kinase are required for Par-4 expression in CLL cells suggesting a novel regulation of Par-4 through BCR signaling Together these results suggest that Par-4 may play a novel progrowth rather than proapoptotic role in CLL and could be targeted to enhance the therapeutic effects of BCR-signaling inhibitors,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[351, 51, 39, 7112, 39, 8, 4118, 30, 1245, 178, 16, 3315, 4, 445, 163, 141, 31, 134, 996, 2, 12, 7112, 39, 1516, 351, 2382, 4, 747, 630, 1, 12, 37, 84, 44, 295, 37, 21, 204, 17, 442, 1193, 552, 37, 29, 171, 7, 2, 29, 32069, 8979, 399, 2818, 1669, 7112, 39, 4, 378, 4939, 76, 295, 132, 14, 15, 132, 18, 37, 2873, 1563, 1, 7112, 39, 4, 171, 552, 526, 7391, 14, 37, 99, 4, 8, 1922, 344, 4, 2657, 7858, 55, 2, 340, 129, 520, 6, 1612, 3344, 6, 695, 31, 417, 1970, 926, 1, 7112, 39, 120, 101, 3, 55, 1, 2657, 2, 1612, 552, 129, 4, 17467, 8979, 399, 7112, 39, 55, 4, 552, 37, 616, 2818, 544, 132, 31, 153, 1062, 314, 22, 297, 1, 1062, 314, 5, 843, 1773, 2, 234, 634, 2078, 850, 600, 1546, 8, 775, 4, 7112, 39, 5992, 893, 2, 178, 2, 35, 344, 4, 351, 4, 1454, 2042, 1, 8309, 8, 2023, 607, 216, 4071, 564, 216, 2, 5796, 564, 216, 32, 616, 9, 7112, 39, 55, 4, 552, 37, 802, 8, 229, 863, 1, 7112, 39, 298, 1062, 314, 1162, 46, 99, 309, 17, 7112, 39, 68, 1343, 8, 229, 32251, 1832, 76, 4118, 200, 4, 552, 2, 359, 40, 238, 6, 1304, 3, 189, 176, 1, 1062, 314, 222]",1337.0,29695515,75

Venetoclax for Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia With 17p Deletion: Results From the Full Population of a Phase II Pivotal Trial.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2018-05-01,"Purpose Venetoclax is an orally bioavailable B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitor. US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency approval for patients with 17p deleted relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia [del(17p) CLL] was based on results from 107 patients. An additional 51 patients were enrolled in a safety expansion cohort. Extended analysis of all enrolled patients, including the effect of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity on outcome, is now reported. Patients and Methods Overall, 158 patients with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated (n = 5) del(17p) CLL received venetoclax 400 mg per day after an initial dose ramp up. Responses were based on 2008 International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia criteria, with monthly physical exams and blood counts. Computed tomography scan was mandatory at week 36, after which assessment made was by clinical evaluation. Marrow biopsy was performed when complete remission was suspected. MRD was assessed by flow cytometry. Results Patients had a median of two prior therapies (range, zero to 10 therapies), 71% had TP53 mutation, and 48% had nodes that were ≥ 5 cm. Median time on venetoclax was 23.1 months (range, 0 to 44.2 months) and median time on study was 26.6 months (range, 0 to 44.2 months). For all patients, investigator-assessed objective response rate was 77% (122 of 158 patients; 20% complete remission) and estimated progression-free survival at 24 months was 54% (95% CI, 45% to 62%). For 16 patients who received prior kinase inhibitors, objective response rate was 63% (10 of 16 patients) and 24-month progression-free survival estimate was 50% (95% CI, 25% to 71%). By intent-to-treat analysis, 48 (30%) of 158 patients achieved MRD below the cutoff of 10<sup>-4</sup> in blood. Common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were hematologic and managed with supportive care and/or dose adjustments. Conclusion Venetoclax achieves durable responses and was well tolerated in patients with del(17p) CLL. A high rate of blood MRD < 10<sup>-4</sup> was achieved in this high-risk population.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",630.0,57.0,Purpose Venetoclax is an orally bioavailable B-cell 2 inhibitor US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency approval for patients with 17p deleted relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic del 17p CLL was based on results from 107 patients An additional 51 patients were enrolled in a safety expansion cohort Extended analysis of all enrolled patients including the effect of minimal residual disease MRD negativity on outcome is now reported Patients and Methods Overall 158 patients with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated n 5 del 17p CLL received venetoclax 400 mg per day after an initial dose ramp up Responses were based on 2008 International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic criteria with monthly physical exams and blood counts Computed tomography scan was mandatory at week 36 after which assessment made was by clinical evaluation Marrow biopsy was performed when complete remission was suspected MRD was assessed by flow cytometry Results Patients had a median of two prior therapies range zero to 10 therapies 71 had TP53 mutation and 48 had nodes that were ≥ 5 cm Median time on venetoclax was 23.1 months range 0 to 44.2 months and median time on study was 26.6 months range 0 to 44.2 months For all patients investigator-assessed objective response rate was 77 122 of 158 patients 20 complete remission and estimated progression-free survival at 24 months was 54 95 CI 45 to 62 For 16 patients who received prior kinase inhibitors objective response rate was 63 10 of 16 patients and 24-month progression-free survival estimate was 50 95 CI 25 to 71 By intent-to-treat analysis 48 30 of 158 patients achieved MRD below the cutoff of 10 sup -4 /sup in blood Common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were hematologic and managed with supportive care and/or dose adjustments Conclusion Venetoclax achieves durable responses and was well tolerated in patients with del 17p CLL A high rate of blood MRD 10 sup -4 /sup was achieved in this high-risk population,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[743, 4454, 16, 35, 1428, 6582, 132, 31, 18, 230, 843, 1773, 2, 234, 634, 2, 1865, 11478, 8613, 1814, 9, 7, 5, 4135, 4389, 591, 430, 442, 1193, 3084, 4135, 552, 10, 90, 23, 99, 29, 3650, 7, 35, 402, 725, 7, 11, 346, 4, 8, 367, 1422, 180, 1747, 65, 1, 62, 346, 7, 141, 3, 254, 1, 1048, 753, 34, 2029, 6014, 23, 228, 16, 1134, 210, 7, 2, 636, 63, 5162, 7, 5, 591, 430, 15, 373, 1278, 78, 33, 3084, 4135, 552, 103, 4454, 1524, 81, 379, 218, 50, 35, 388, 61, 20047, 126, 253, 11, 90, 23, 1375, 944, 4014, 23, 442, 1193, 371, 5, 3889, 900, 12318, 2, 315, 1911, 1220, 872, 1657, 10, 7322, 28, 647, 511, 50, 92, 455, 1229, 10, 20, 38, 451, 581, 411, 10, 173, 198, 236, 734, 10, 2768, 2029, 10, 275, 20, 1412, 1914, 99, 7, 42, 8, 52, 1, 100, 324, 235, 184, 5115, 6, 79, 235, 792, 42, 1206, 258, 2, 576, 42, 502, 17, 11, 749, 33, 494, 52, 98, 23, 4454, 10, 382, 14, 53, 184, 13, 6, 584, 18, 53, 2, 52, 98, 23, 45, 10, 432, 49, 53, 184, 13, 6, 584, 18, 53, 9, 62, 7, 3464, 275, 461, 51, 116, 10, 849, 3285, 1, 5162, 7, 179, 236, 734, 2, 661, 91, 115, 25, 28, 259, 53, 10, 667, 48, 58, 512, 6, 744, 9, 245, 7, 54, 103, 324, 216, 222, 461, 51, 116, 10, 676, 79, 1, 245, 7, 2, 259, 811, 91, 115, 25, 1191, 10, 212, 48, 58, 243, 6, 792, 20, 1697, 6, 943, 65, 576, 201, 1, 5162, 7, 513, 2029, 2736, 3, 2779, 1, 79, 172, 39, 172, 4, 315, 186, 88, 27, 2, 39, 290, 281, 11, 813, 2, 2231, 5, 1877, 165, 2, 15, 61, 6017, 1221, 4454, 6358, 1480, 253, 2, 10, 149, 421, 4, 7, 5, 3084, 4135, 552, 8, 64, 116, 1, 315, 2029, 79, 172, 39, 172, 10, 513, 4, 26, 64, 43, 266]",1988.0,29715056,271

HLA alleles at class I and II loci were imputed from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using SNP2HLA for 3,617 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), 2,686 follicular lymphomas (FL), 2,878 chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphomas (CLL/SLL), 741 marginal zone lymphomas (MZL), and 8,753 controls of European descent.

Update on signal inhibitors in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,2018-04-01,"The last decade has seen major progress in our understanding of the pathobiology of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and the identification of potential new therapeutic targets. As a result, researchers have developed novel targeted therapies, several of which are already approved and many of which are in advanced stages of clinical development.

"Cells, cytokines, chemokines, and cancer stress: A biobehavioral study of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",Cancer,Cancer,2018-05-14,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most prevalent adult leukemia, with profound disease-related cellular, humoral, and innate immune suppression. The objective of this study was to study the correlations between stress and disease-specific, negative prognostic cellular, cytokine, and chemokine markers in patients with CLL. A single-group, observational design was used. Patients with relapsed/refractory CLL (N = 96) who were entering a phase 2 trial of an experimental therapy (ibrutinib) were studied. Before the first dose, a validated self-report measure of stress (the Impact of Event Scale) was completed, and blood was drawn for absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) and for cytokine and chemokine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Multiple linear regression models tested stress as a concurrent predictor of ALCs; of cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α [TNFα], a proliferation-inducing ligand [APRIL], B-cell activating factor [BAFF], interleukin 6 [IL-6], IL-10, IL-16, and vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]); and of the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (CCL3). Controlling for relevant demographic variables, comorbidities, CLL genetic risk (deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 [del17p]), and correlates of inflammation, stress predicted higher ALCs (P < .05), and higher levels of TNFα (P < .05), IL-16 (P < .01), and CCL3 (P < .05). Stress was not associated with APRIL, BAFF, IL-6, IL-10, or VEGF. Novel biobehavioral data from patients with relapsed/refractory CLL demonstrate that stress is related to heightened levels of cellular, cytokine, and chemokine markers associated previously with progressive disease in CLL. The current results indicate that stress is related to immune and inflammatory processes that contribute to cancer cell proliferation and survival. These data provide a first look into these processes.

PD-1 Expression in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and Large B-cell Richter Transformation (DLBCL-RT): A Characteristic Feature of DLBCL-RT and Potential Surrogate Marker for Clonal Relatedness.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2018-07-01,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) is a low-grade B-cell neoplasm and ∼2% to 9% patients develop an aggressive lymphoma, most commonly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Richter transformation, DLBCL-RT). Programmed death-1 (PD-1) pathway plays a crucial role in tumor host immunity evasion and its blockade has emerged as an effective anti-cancer immunotherapy. PD-L1 and PD-1 expression has shown predictive value in anti-PD cancer immunotherapy; however, it has not been well documented in CLL/SLL and DLBCL-RT. We evaluated PD-1 and PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry in 39 CLL/SLL, 15 DLBCL-RT, and 26 other DLBCL. In CLL/SLL, neoplastic B-cell PD-1 expression was weak and restricted to prolymphocytes/paraimmunoblasts within proliferation centers (PCs) and accentuated PCs of all sizes. Neoplastic B-cell PD-1 expression was highly prevalent and demonstrated increased intensity in DLBCL-RT, but in contrast was only rarely seen in other DLBCL (12/15 vs. 1/26; P<0.0001). An excellent correlation (90% concordance) was observed between neoplastic B-cell PD-1 immunohistochemistry positivity and molecularly defined CLL/SLL clonal relatedness in DLBCL-RT. PD-L1 expression was observed on the neoplastic B cells in rare DLBCL-RT and other DLBCL cases (1/15 vs. 1/26; P>0.05) as well as background histiocytes and dendritic cells. Overall survival of DLBCL-RT was significantly inferior to that of the other DLBCL (median, 16.9 vs. 106.1 mo; P=0.002). Our findings suggest a biological continuum from prolymphocytes/paraimmunoblasts in CLL/SLL PCs to the neoplastic B-cells in DLBCL-RT.

Biomarkers for checkpoint inhibition in hematologic malignancies.,Seminars in cancer biology,Semin. Cancer Biol.,2018-06-18,"In the past few years we have seen remarkable paradigm shifts in the treatment of many solid tumors due to the introduction of inhibitors targeting immune checkpoints such as PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4. Recent results indicate that checkpoint inhibition also represents a very promising approach for certain types of hematologic malignancies. Unfortunately, treatment with checkpoint inhibitors is also associated with substantial toxicities and high costs and only a subset of patients appears to derive clinical benefit from these treatments. This demonstrates the urgent need for biomarkers for the identification of patient populations that are likely to respond to this type of therapy and/or have fewer side effects. Here, we have reviewed available information on the prognostic and predictive value of biomarkers for anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 as the most commonly used checkpoint inhibitors. There are currently no reliable biomarkers capable of predicting responses to anti-CTLA-4 agents, such as ipilimumab, in hematologic malignancies. Certain polymorphisms in the CTLA-4 gene, however, seem to have an impact on the patients' outcome, especially in the case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). There is now sufficient data supporting PD-L1 expression levels in the tumor tissue as an independent prognostic factor in B cell lymphomas such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

Targeting the C481S Ibrutinib-Resistance Mutation in Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase Using PROTAC-Mediated Degradation.,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,2018-06-14,"Inhibition of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) with the irreversible inhibitor ibrutinib has emerged as a transformative treatment option for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other B-cell malignancies, yet >80% of CLL patients develop resistance due to a cysteine to serine mutation at the site covalently bound by ibrutinib (C481S). Currently, an effective treatment option for C481S patients exhibiting relapse to ibrutinib does not exist, and these patients have poor outcomes. To address this, we have developed a PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) that induces degradation of both wild-type and C481S mutant BTK. We selected a lead PROTAC, MT-802, from several candidates on the basis of its potency to induce BTK knockdown. MT-802 recruits BTK to the cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase complex to trigger BTK ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome. MT-802 binds fewer off-target kinases than ibrutinib does and retains an equivalent potency (>99% degradation at nanomolar concentrations) against wild-type and C481S BTK. In cells isolated from CLL patients with the C481S mutation, MT-802 is able to reduce the pool of active, phosphorylated BTK whereas ibrutinib cannot.

Mixed-phenotype large granular lymphocytic leukemia: a rare subtype in the large granular lymphocytic leukemia spectrum.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2018-06-24,"Large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL) is a chronic proliferation of cytotoxic lymphocytes in which more than 70% of patients develop cytopenia(s) requiring therapy. LGLL includes T-cell LGLL and chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of natural killer (NK) cells. The neoplastic cells in LGLL usually exhibit a single immunophenotype in a patient, with CD8-positive/αβ T-cell type being the most common, followed by NK-cell, γδ T-cell, and CD4-positive/αβ T-cell types. We investigated a total of 220 LGLL cases and identified 12 mixed-phenotype LGLLs (5%): 7 cases with coexistent αβ T-cell and NK-cell clones and 5 with coexistent αβ and γδ T-cell clones. With a median follow-up of 48 months, the clinicopathological characteristics of these patients seemed similar to those of typical LGLL patients. Treatment was instituted in 9 patients, and 5 patients (55%) attained complete hematologic response or partial response. The therapeutic response rate of this cohort is comparable to the reported overall response rate of 40% to 60% in typical LGLL patients. Three patients who did not receive any treatment had progressive or persistent cytopenias. Interestingly, inverted proportions of 2 clones at disease recurrence were identified in 4 patients (36%) and stable clonal proportions in 7 patients (64%).

Noncovalent inhibition of C481S Bruton tyrosine kinase by GDC-0853: a new treatment strategy for ibrutinib-resistant CLL.,Blood,Blood,2018-07-17,"The clinical success of ibrutinib validates Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibition as an effective strategy for treating hematologic malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Despite ibrutinib's ability to produce durable remissions in patients, acquired resistance can develop, mostly commonly by mutation of C481 of BTK in the ibrutinib binding site. Here, we characterize a novel BTK inhibitor, GDC-0853, to evaluate its preclinical efficacy in ibrutinib-naive and ibrutinib-resistant CLL. GDC-0853 is unique among reported BTK inhibitors in that it does not rely upon covalent reaction with C481 to stabilize its occupancy within BTK's adenosine triphosphate binding site. As with ibrutinib, GDC-0853 potently reduces B-cell receptor signaling, viability, NF-κB-dependent transcription, activation, and migration in treatment naïve CLL cells. We found that GDC-0853 also inhibits the most commonly reported ibrutinib-resistant BTK mutant (C481S) both in a biochemical enzyme activity assay and in a stably transfected 293T cell line and maintains cytotoxicity against patient CLL cells harboring C481S BTK mutations. Additionally, GDC-0853 does not inhibit endothelial growth factor receptor or ITK, 2 alternative targets of ibrutinib that are likely responsible for some adverse events and may reduce the efficacy of ibrutinib-antibody combinations, respectively. Our results using GDC-0853 indicate that noncovalent, selective BTK inhibition may be effective in CLL either as monotherapy or in combination with therapeutic antibodies, especially among the emerging population of patients with acquired resistance to ibrutinib therapy.",Journal Article,553.0,9.0,The clinical success of ibrutinib validates Bruton tyrosine kinase BTK inhibition as an effective strategy for treating hematologic malignancies including chronic lymphocytic CLL Despite ibrutinib 's ability to produce durable remissions in patients acquired resistance can develop mostly commonly by mutation of C481 of BTK in the ibrutinib binding site Here we characterize a novel BTK inhibitor GDC-0853 to evaluate its preclinical efficacy in ibrutinib-naive and ibrutinib-resistant CLL GDC-0853 is unique among reported BTK inhibitors in that it does not rely upon covalent reaction with C481 to stabilize its occupancy within BTK 's adenosine triphosphate binding site As with ibrutinib GDC-0853 potently reduces B-cell receptor signaling viability NF-κB-dependent transcription activation and migration in treatment naïve CLL cells We found that GDC-0853 also inhibits the most commonly reported ibrutinib-resistant BTK mutant C481S both in a biochemical enzyme activity assay and in a stably transfected 293T cell line and maintains cytotoxicity against patient CLL cells harboring C481S BTK mutations Additionally GDC-0853 does not inhibit endothelial growth factor receptor or ITK 2 alternative targets of ibrutinib that are likely responsible for some adverse events and may reduce the efficacy of ibrutinib-antibody combinations respectively Our results using GDC-0853 indicate that noncovalent selective BTK inhibition may be effective in CLL either as monotherapy or in combination with therapeutic antibodies especially among the emerging population of patients with acquired resistance to ibrutinib therapy,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 38, 1825, 1, 1795, 11235, 5796, 564, 216, 3611, 297, 22, 35, 323, 692, 9, 1367, 813, 441, 141, 442, 1193, 552, 550, 1795, 292, 801, 6, 2410, 1480, 3166, 4, 7, 1294, 251, 122, 690, 2754, 841, 20, 258, 1, 36300, 1, 3611, 4, 3, 1795, 791, 606, 467, 21, 1507, 8, 229, 3611, 230, 6165, 29988, 6, 376, 211, 693, 209, 4, 1795, 2462, 2, 1795, 436, 552, 6165, 29988, 16, 991, 107, 210, 3611, 222, 4, 17, 192, 1097, 44, 5533, 1548, 10747, 1329, 5, 36300, 6, 10863, 211, 8509, 262, 3611, 292, 4938, 7345, 791, 606, 22, 5, 1795, 6165, 29988, 4684, 2389, 132, 31, 153, 314, 2120, 1365, 2448, 470, 866, 363, 2, 1381, 4, 24, 2809, 552, 37, 21, 204, 17, 6165, 29988, 120, 1576, 3, 96, 841, 210, 1795, 436, 3611, 620, 17045, 110, 4, 8, 1487, 1644, 128, 719, 2, 4, 8, 5834, 3245, 22270, 31, 328, 2, 8107, 1408, 480, 69, 552, 37, 2105, 17045, 3611, 138, 1724, 6165, 29988, 1097, 44, 1433, 845, 129, 161, 153, 15, 15430, 18, 1091, 637, 1, 1795, 17, 32, 322, 2327, 9, 476, 290, 281, 2, 68, 969, 3, 209, 1, 1795, 548, 1247, 106, 114, 99, 75, 6165, 29988, 1008, 17, 33564, 1094, 3611, 297, 68, 40, 323, 4, 552, 361, 22, 1411, 15, 4, 150, 5, 189, 890, 1093, 107, 3, 1478, 266, 1, 7, 5, 1294, 251, 6, 1795, 36]",1622.0,30018078,222
Lenalidomide consolidation benefits patients with CLL receiving chemoimmunotherapy: results for CALGB 10404 (Alliance).,Blood advances,Blood Adv,2018-07-01,"Prior to novel targeted agents for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the best chemoimmunotherapy regimen in patients with non-del(11q) disease was unclear. The role of lenalidomide was also not defined. This phase 2 study randomized 342 untreated patients with non-del(11q) CLL requiring therapy to fludarabine plus rituximab (FR; n = 123), FR plus lenalidomide consolidation (FR+L; n = 109), or FR plus cyclophosphamide (FCR; n = 110) and compared 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates of each to the historical control rate with FC (60%). Patients with del(11q) in at least 20% of pretreatment cells continued with FCR (n = 27) or were reassigned to FCR+L (n = 31) and excluded from the primary analysis. Among non-del(11q) patients, 2-year PFS rates were 64% (90% confidence interval [CI], 57-71; FR), 72% (90% CI, 65-79; FR+L), and 74% (90% CI, 66-80; FCR); FR+L and FCR had rates significantly greater than historical control. Median PFS was significantly shorter with FR compared with FR+L (<i>P</i> = .04) and FCR (<i>P</i> < .001): 43 (95% CI, 33-50), 61 (95% CI, 45-71), and 97 (95% CI, 61 to not reached) months, respectively.

Mechanistic Insights into CpG DNA and IL-15 Synergy in Promoting B Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Clonal Expansion.,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",J. Immunol.,2018-08-01,"Malignant cell growth within patients with B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is largely restricted to lymphoid tissues, particularly lymph nodes. The recent in vitro finding that TLR-9 ligand (oligodeoxynucleotide [ODN]) and IL-15 exhibit strong synergy in promoting B-CLL growth may be particularly relevant to growth in these sites. This study shows IL-15-producing cells are prevalent within B-CLL-infiltrated lymph nodes and, using purified B-CLL cells from blood, investigates the mechanism for ODN and IL-15 synergy in driving B-CLL growth. ODN boosts baseline levels of phospho-RelA(S529) in B-CLL and promotes NF-κB-driven increases in <i>IL15RA</i> and <i>IL2RB</i> mRNA, followed by elevated IL-15Rα and IL-2/IL-15Rβ (CD122) protein. IL-15→CD122 signaling during a critical interval, 20 to 36-48 h following initial ODN exposure, is required for optimal induction of the cycling process. Furthermore, experiments with neutralizing anti-IL-15 and anti-CD122 mAbs indicate that clonal expansion requires continued IL-15/CD122 signaling during cycling. The latter is consistent with evidence of heightened <i>IL2RB</i> mRNA in the fraction of recently proliferated B-CLL cells within patient peripheral blood. Compromised ODN+IL-15 growth with limited cell density is consistent with a role for upregulated IL-15Rα in facilitating homotypic <i>trans</i> IL-15 signaling, although there may be other explanations. Together, the findings show that ODN and IL-15 elicit temporally distinct signals that function in a coordinated manner to drive B-CLL clonal expansion.",Journal Article,538.0,2.0,Malignant cell growth within patients with B cell chronic lymphocytic B-CLL is largely restricted to lymphoid tissues particularly lymph nodes The recent in vitro finding that TLR-9 ligand oligodeoxynucleotide ODN and IL-15 exhibit strong synergy in promoting B-CLL growth may be particularly relevant to growth in these sites This study shows IL-15-producing cells are prevalent within B-CLL-infiltrated lymph nodes and using purified B-CLL cells from blood investigates the mechanism for ODN and IL-15 synergy in driving B-CLL growth ODN boosts baseline levels of phospho-RelA S529 in B-CLL and promotes NF-κB-driven increases in i IL15RA /i and i IL2RB /i mRNA followed by elevated IL-15Rα and IL-2/IL-15Rβ CD122 protein IL-15→CD122 signaling during a critical interval 20 to 36-48 h following initial ODN exposure is required for optimal induction of the cycling process Furthermore experiments with neutralizing anti-IL-15 and anti-CD122 mAbs indicate that clonal expansion requires continued IL-15/CD122 signaling during cycling The latter is consistent with evidence of heightened i IL2RB /i mRNA in the fraction of recently proliferated B-CLL cells within patient peripheral blood Compromised ODN+IL-15 growth with limited cell density is consistent with a role for upregulated IL-15Rα in facilitating homotypic i trans /i IL-15 signaling although there may be other explanations Together the findings show that ODN and IL-15 elicit temporally distinct signals that function in a coordinated manner to drive B-CLL clonal expansion,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[393, 31, 129, 262, 7, 5, 132, 31, 442, 1193, 132, 552, 16, 1733, 2016, 6, 2303, 742, 823, 263, 502, 3, 435, 4, 439, 1567, 17, 8701, 83, 1232, 15543, 11601, 2, 501, 167, 2239, 1082, 3439, 4, 2388, 132, 552, 129, 68, 40, 823, 867, 6, 129, 4, 46, 633, 26, 45, 1949, 501, 167, 3787, 37, 32, 2485, 262, 132, 552, 8652, 263, 502, 2, 75, 5963, 132, 552, 37, 29, 315, 7259, 3, 670, 9, 11601, 2, 501, 167, 3439, 4, 4057, 132, 552, 129, 11601, 20239, 330, 148, 1, 3125, 8672, 73356, 4, 132, 552, 2, 2148, 1365, 2448, 1621, 1106, 4, 70, 73357, 70, 2, 70, 36532, 70, 956, 370, 20, 804, 501, 51180, 2, 501, 18, 501, 73358, 30963, 178, 501, 51181, 314, 190, 8, 740, 268, 179, 6, 511, 576, 555, 366, 388, 11601, 645, 16, 616, 9, 665, 504, 1, 3, 9165, 1129, 798, 2332, 5, 5788, 312, 501, 167, 2, 312, 30963, 5207, 1008, 17, 1946, 1422, 1706, 1351, 501, 167, 30963, 314, 190, 9165, 3, 3286, 16, 925, 5, 241, 1, 7145, 70, 36532, 70, 956, 4, 3, 1509, 1, 761, 15535, 132, 552, 37, 262, 69, 672, 315, 4867, 11601, 501, 167, 129, 5, 383, 31, 1263, 16, 925, 5, 8, 200, 9, 2684, 501, 51180, 4, 5379, 19579, 70, 3437, 70, 501, 167, 314, 242, 125, 68, 40, 127, 11616, 1162, 3, 272, 514, 17, 11601, 2, 501, 167, 5487, 11114, 834, 2312, 17, 343, 4, 8, 5725, 1708, 6, 3279, 132, 552, 1946, 1422]",1538.0,30068596,240
Cancer-Specific Stress and Trajectories of Psychological and Physical Functioning in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.,Annals of behavioral medicine : a publication of the Society of Behavioral Medicine,Ann Behav Med,2018-03-01,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is the most prevalent adult leukemia. The disease is incurable with a cycling of treatment and relapse common. Little is known about the psychological and physical functioning of patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Cancer-specific stress is an important individual difference variable that predicts psychological and physical outcomes. To examine cancer-specific stress at treatment initiation as a predictor of psychological and physical functioning trajectories in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia during the first 5 months of treatment. Patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (N = 152) enrolled in a phase II clinical trial completed self-report measures at treatment initiation (baseline), 1, 2, and 5 months of treatment. Cancer-specific stress at baseline was examined as a predictor of psychological (cognitive-affective depressive symptoms, negative mood, mental health quality of life) and physical functioning (fatigue interference, sleep problems, physical health quality of life), controlling for demographic and treatment variables. Using multilevel modeling, higher baseline cancer-specific stress was related to worse psychological (cognitive-affective depressive symptoms, negative mood, mental health quality of life) and physical functioning (fatigue interference, sleep problems) at baseline and more rapid improvements during the next 5 months. Despite these improvements, higher baseline cancer-specific stress remained associated with poorer 5-month psychological, though not physical, functioning.

"Phase 1b study of obinutuzumab, ibrutinib, and venetoclax in relapsed and refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",Blood,Blood,2018-08-15,"Targeted therapies including the engineered afucosylated anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody obinutuzumab, Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib, and B-cell lymphoma protein 2 inhibitor venetoclax have demonstrated significant clinical activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and, based on their complementary mechanisms, are ideal for combination. However, combining venetoclax with other active agents raises safety concerns, as it may increase the risk for tumor lysis syndrome. To minimize this risk, we designed and implemented a fixed-duration regimen using sequentially administered obinutuzumab followed by ibrutinib (cycle 2) and venetoclax (cycle 3), for a total of fourteen 28-day cycles. This phase 1b study included 12 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. We tested 3 dose levels of venetoclax and identified the doses of all 3 agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in the combination. Adverse events were consistent with known toxicities of the individual agents, with hematologic adverse events being most frequent. No clinically significant tumor lysis syndrome occurred. The overall response rate was 92% (95% confidence interval, 62%-100%), with 42% (5/12) achieving a complete remission or complete remission with incomplete marrow recovery. There were 6 patients with no detectable CLL in both the blood and bone marrow at the end of treatment. We found this regimen to be safe and tolerable in CLL, and capable of inducing deep responses, justifying future study in our ongoing phase 2 cohorts of relapsed or refractory and treatment-naive patients, as well as larger phase 3 trials currently in planning.

An update in treating transformed lymphoma.,Best practice & research. Clinical haematology,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,2018-07-25,"Indolent lymphomas typically have a prolonged course and favorable prognosis. Recent data support survival times that can reach several decades, even if periodic treatment is needed to manage symptoms or stabilize disease. However, all indolent lymphomas have the potential to undergo transformation to an aggressive phenotype, clinically characterized by a rapid progression of adenopathy, new-onset constitutional symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities, and the immediate need for therapeutic intervention. The most common scenario is transformation of follicular lymphoma to either diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 translocations; however, other indolent subtypes such as marginal zone lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or even nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, can undergo similar histologic transformation. The prognosis of transformed lymphomas has historically been quite poor, but there is ample evidence this is changing in the rituximab era. This article will provide a review of transformed lymphomas with an emphasis on treatment and the nuances of diagnosis and clinical management. Unless otherwise specified, all discussion in this review pertains to transformed follicular lymphoma which is the more common scenario and the subtype with the most robust data. In many cases, this information can be extrapolated and applied to other indolent histologies (i.e. transformed marginal zone lymphoma); however, several other clinical scenarios, such as Richter's transformation and ""double hit"" transformations, warrant a distinct discussion and will be reviewed separately.",Journal Article,545.0,2.0,Indolent lymphomas typically have a prolonged course and favorable prognosis Recent data support survival times that can reach several decades even if periodic treatment is needed to manage symptoms or stabilize disease However all indolent lymphomas have the potential to undergo transformation to an aggressive phenotype clinically characterized by a rapid progression of adenopathy new-onset constitutional symptoms or laboratory abnormalities and the immediate need for therapeutic intervention The most common scenario is transformation of follicular to either diffuse large B-cell or high-grade B-cell with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 translocations however other indolent subtypes such as marginal zone lymphoplasmacytic small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic or even nodular lymphocyte predominant can undergo similar histologic transformation The prognosis of transformed lymphomas has historically been quite poor but there is ample evidence this is changing in the rituximab era This article will provide a review of transformed lymphomas with an emphasis on treatment and the nuances of diagnosis and clinical management Unless otherwise specified all discussion in this review pertains to transformed follicular which is the more common scenario and the subtype with the most robust data In many cases this information can be extrapolated and applied to other indolent histologies i.e transformed marginal zone however several other clinical scenarios such as Richter 's transformation and `` double hit '' transformations warrant a distinct discussion and will be reviewed separately,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[2316, 1557, 1969, 47, 8, 1069, 906, 2, 913, 356, 435, 74, 538, 25, 1072, 17, 122, 3690, 392, 1968, 871, 492, 9086, 24, 16, 575, 6, 4001, 507, 15, 10863, 34, 137, 62, 2316, 1557, 47, 3, 174, 6, 1251, 1392, 6, 35, 571, 1005, 505, 765, 20, 8, 1321, 91, 1, 7741, 217, 1707, 5962, 507, 15, 1624, 1171, 2, 3, 2181, 594, 9, 189, 788, 3, 96, 186, 5456, 16, 1392, 1, 1974, 6, 361, 1388, 375, 132, 31, 15, 64, 88, 132, 31, 5, 1371, 2, 3214, 2, 15, 8148, 3262, 137, 127, 2316, 814, 225, 22, 3450, 3614, 5325, 302, 1193, 4763, 442, 1193, 15, 871, 4481, 1448, 2750, 122, 1251, 288, 884, 1392, 3, 356, 1, 2423, 1557, 71, 3578, 85, 6223, 334, 84, 125, 16, 17814, 241, 26, 16, 3600, 4, 3, 855, 1713, 26, 946, 303, 377, 8, 206, 1, 2423, 1557, 5, 35, 3136, 23, 24, 2, 3, 15967, 1, 147, 2, 38, 284, 6179, 2632, 3575, 62, 2488, 4, 26, 206, 17594, 6, 2423, 1974, 92, 16, 3, 80, 186, 5456, 2, 3, 875, 5, 3, 96, 1922, 74, 4, 445, 140, 26, 487, 122, 40, 10727, 2, 1498, 6, 127, 2316, 3489, 70, 563, 2423, 3450, 3614, 137, 392, 127, 38, 3964, 225, 22, 8452, 292, 1392, 2, 1627, 6519, 522, 18030, 2946, 8, 834, 2488, 2, 303, 40, 446, 3582]",1602.0,30213394,282

Measures of well-being were assessed in RESONATE, where previously treated patients with CLL/SLL were randomized to receive ibrutinib 420 mg/day (n = 195) or ofatumumab (n = 196) for up to 24 weeks. Endpoints included hematologic function, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), disease-related symptoms, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), and medical resource utilization. With up to 24 months' follow-up (median, 16.4 months), 79% of cytopenic patients showed sustained hematologic improvement (82% with improved platelet count, 69% with improved hemoglobin) on ibrutinib versus 43% on ofatumumab (P < .0001). Higher rates of clinically meaningful improvement were demonstrated with ibrutinib versus ofatumumab for FACIT-F and EORTC global health. Greater improvement was observed in disease-related weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, and abdominal discomfort with ibrutinib versus ofatumumab. Hospitalizations in the first 30 days occurred less frequently with ibrutinib than ofatumumab (0.087 vs. 0.184 events/patient; P = .0198).

A pilot study of lower doses of ibrutinib in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2018-09-25,"Ibrutinib is highly efficacious and used at 420 mg/d for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We previously demonstrated a decline in Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) protein levels in CLL cells after 1 cycle of ibrutinib, suggesting ibrutinib dose could be lowered after the first cycle without loss of biological effect. To test this postulate, a pilot study (NCT02801578) was designed to systematically reduce ibrutinib dosing within the same patient with CLL over the course of three 28-day cycles. After an initial cycle of 420 mg/d, the dose was reduced to 280 mg/d in cycle 2, and then to 140 mg/d in cycle 3. Eleven patients began study treatment, and 9 completed the 3 cycles. Plasma and intracellular pharmacokinetics (PK), BTK occupancy, and pharmacodynamic (PD) response at different doses of ibrutinib were compared. Plasma and intracellular levels of ibrutinib were dose-dependent, and even the lowest dose was sufficient to occupy, on average, more than 95% of BTK protein. In concert, BTK downstream signaling inhibition was maintained with 140 mg/d ibrutinib in cycle 3, and there were comparable reductions in total and phospho-BTK (Tyr223) protein levels across 3 cycles. Reductions of plasma chemokine CCL3 and CCL4 levels, considered to be biomarkers of ibrutinib response, were similar during the 3 cycles. These PK/PD data demonstrate that after 1 cycle of ibrutinib at the standard 420 mg/d dose, the dose can be reduced without losing biological activity. Clinical efficacy of lower doses needs to be systematically evaluated. Such dose reductions would lower drug cost, lessen untoward toxicity, and facilitate rationale-based combinations.

Splicing modulation sensitizes chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells to venetoclax by remodeling mitochondrial apoptotic dependencies.,JCI insight,JCI Insight,2018-10-04,"The identification of targetable vulnerabilities in the context of therapeutic resistance is a key challenge in cancer treatment. We detected pervasive aberrant splicing as a characteristic feature of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), irrespective of splicing factor mutation status, which was associated with sensitivity to the spliceosome modulator, E7107. Splicing modulation affected CLL survival pathways, including members of the B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2) family of proteins, remodeling antiapoptotic dependencies of human and murine CLL cells. E7107 treatment decreased myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL1) dependence and increased BCL2 dependence, sensitizing primary human CLL cells and venetoclax-resistant CLL-like cells from an Eμ-TCL1-based adoptive transfer murine model to treatment with the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax.

Comparative assessment of prognostic models in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: evaluation in Indian cohort.,Annals of hematology,Ann. Hematol.,2018-10-18,"Prognostic indices combining several clinical and laboratory parameters have been proposed for prognostication in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Recently, international consortium on CLL proposed an international prognostic index (CLL-IPI) integrating clinical, molecular, and genetic parameters. The present study was designed to evaluate the reproducibility of CLL-IPI in Indian CLL cohort. The prognostic ability of CLL-IPI in terms of overall survival (OS) and time to first treatment (TTFT) was investigated in treatment-naive CLL patients and also compared with other existing prognostic scores. For assigning scores, clinical and laboratory details were obtained from medical records, and IGHV gene mutation status, β2-microglobulin levels, and copy number variations were determined using c-DNA, ELISA, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), respectively. The scores were generated as per the weighted grades assigned to each variable involved in score categorization. The predictive value of prognostic models was assessed and compared using Harrell's C-index and Akaike's information criterion (AIC). Stratification of patients according to CLL-IPI yielded significant differences in terms of OS and TTFT (p < 0.001). Comparative assessment of scores for OS suggested better performance of CLL-IPI (C = 0.64, AIC = 740) followed by Barcelona-Brno (C = 0.61, AIC = 754) and MDACC score (C = 0.59, AIC = 759).

Dual inhibition of PI3K signaling and histone deacetylation halts proliferation and induces lethality in mantle cell lymphoma.,Oncogene,Oncogene,2018-10-25,"The dysregulation of PI3K signaling has been implicated as an underlying mechanism associated with resistance to Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibition by ibrutinib in both chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Ibrutinib resistance has become a major unmet clinical need, and the development of therapeutics to overcome ibrutinib resistance will greatly improve the poor outcomes of ibrutinib-exposed MCL patients. CUDC-907 inhibits both PI3K and HDAC functionality to exert synergistic or additive effects. Therefore, the activity of CUDC-907 was examined in MCL cell lines and patient primary cells, including ibrutinib-resistant MCL cells. The efficacy of CUDC-907 was further examined in an ibrutinib-resistant MCL patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse model. The molecular mechanisms by which CUDC-907 dually inhibits PI3K and histone deacetylation were assessed using reverse protein array, immunoblotting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with sequencing. We showed evidence that CUDC-907 treatment increased histone acetylation in MCL cells.

PI3K p110δ inactivation antagonizes chronic lymphocytic leukemia and reverses T cell immune suppression.,The Journal of clinical investigation,J. Clin. Invest.,2018-11-19,"Targeted therapy with small molecules directed at essential survival pathways in leukemia represents a major advance, including the phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (PI3K) p110δ inhibitor idelalisib. Here, we found that genetic inactivation of p110δ (p110δD910A/D910A) in the Eμ-TCL1 murine chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) model impaired B cell receptor signaling and B cell migration, and significantly delayed leukemia pathogenesis. Regardless of TCL1 expression, p110δ inactivation led to rectal prolapse in mice resembling autoimmune colitis in patients receiving idelalisib. Moreover, we showed that p110δ inactivation in the microenvironment protected against CLL and acute myeloid leukemia. After receiving higher numbers of TCL1 leukemia cells, half of p110δD910A/D910A mice spontaneously recovered from high disease burden and resisted leukemia rechallenge. Despite disease resistance, p110δD910A/D910A mice exhibited compromised CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response, and depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells restored leukemia. Interestingly, p110δD910A/D910A mice showed significantly impaired Treg expansion that associated with disease clearance. Reconstitution of p110δD910A/D910A mice with p110δWT/WT Tregs reversed leukemia resistance.

Ibrutinib Regimens versus Chemoimmunotherapy in Older Patients with Untreated CLL.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2018-12-01,"Ibrutinib has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) since 2016 but has not been compared with chemoimmunotherapy. We conducted a phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib, either alone or in combination with rituximab, relative to chemoimmunotherapy. Patients 65 years of age or older who had untreated CLL were randomly assigned to receive bendamustine plus rituximab, ibrutinib, or ibrutinib plus rituximab. The primary end point was progression-free survival. The Alliance Data and Safety Monitoring Board made the decision to release the data after the protocol-specified efficacy threshold had been met. A total of 183 patients were assigned to receive bendamustine plus rituximab, 182 to receive ibrutinib, and 182 to receive ibrutinib plus rituximab. Median progression-free survival was reached only with bendamustine plus rituximab. The estimated percentage of patients with progression-free survival at 2 years was 74% with bendamustine plus rituximab and was higher with ibrutinib alone (87%; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26 to 0.58; P<0.001) and with ibrutinib plus rituximab (88%; hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.59; P<0.001). There was no significant difference between the ibrutinib-plus-rituximab group and the ibrutinib group with regard to progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.62; P=0.49). With a median follow-up of 38 months, there was no significant difference among the three treatment groups with regard to overall survival. The rate of grade 3, 4, or 5 hematologic adverse events was higher with bendamustine plus rituximab (61%) than with ibrutinib or ibrutinib plus rituximab (41% and 39%, respectively), whereas the rate of grade 3, 4, or 5 nonhematologic adverse events was lower with bendamustine plus rituximab (63%) than with the ibrutinib-containing regimens (74% with each regimen). Among older patients with untreated CLL, treatment with ibrutinib was superior to treatment with bendamustine plus rituximab with regard to progression-free survival. There was no significant difference between ibrutinib and ibrutinib plus rituximab with regard to progression-free survival.

Targeted multigene deep sequencing of Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant chronic lymphocytic leukemia with disease progression and Richter transformation.,Cancer,Cancer,2018-12-03,"In a proportion of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), resistance to Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors (BTKi) is attributed to acquired BTK/phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCG2) mutations. However, knowledge regarding additional genetic lesions associated with BTK/PLCG2 mutations, and gene mutations in patients lacking BTK/PLCG2 mutations, is limited. Using targeted deep sequencing, mutations in 29 genes associated with CLL and/or the BCR signaling pathway were assessed in patients with CLL who developed resistance to BTK inhibition with ibrutinib/acalabrutinib at a single institution. The study group included 29 patients with BTKi-resistant CLL, 23 patients with disease progression, and 6 patients with Richter transformation (RT). The median times to disease progression and RT were 33.3 months and 13.3 months, respectively. In 11 patients, sequencing was possible at both baseline (prior to treatment with BTKi) and at time of disease progression/RT. Of these patients, 4 demonstrated BTK mutations at the time of disease progression/RT; patients without BTK mutations frequently acquired mutations associated with disease progression/RT in TP53, SF3B1, and CARD11, whereas additional mutations were rare in patients with BTK-mutated CLL. Sequencing of all 29 patients at the time of disease progression/RT identified BTK mutations at a frequency of 66%, including a novel V537I mutation. Among patients with disease progression, BTK mutations were observed in 16 patients (70%). The median time to disease progression was shorter in patients without BTK mutations compared with those with BTK-mutated CLL. Among patients with RT, SF3B1 mutations were more frequent than BTK mutations (67% vs 50%).

Fixed Duration of Venetoclax-Rituximab in Relapsed/Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Eradicates Minimal Residual Disease and Prolongs Survival: Post-Treatment Follow-Up of the MURANO Phase III Study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2018-12-03,"The MURANO study demonstrated significant progression-free survival (PFS) benefit for fixed-duration venetoclax-rituximab compared with bendamustine-rituximab in relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. With all patients off treatment, we report minimal residual disease (MRD) kinetics and updated outcomes. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 years of venetoclax plus rituximab during the first six cycles, or six cycles of bendamustine-rituximab. Primary end point was PFS. Safety and peripheral blood (PB) MRD status-at cycle 4, 2 to 3 months after end of combination therapy (EOCT), and every 3 to 6 months thereafter-were secondary end points. Of 194 patients, 174 (90%) completed the venetoclax-rituximab phase and 130 (67%) completed 2 years of venetoclax. With a median follow-up of 36 months, PFS and overall survival remain superior to bendamustine-rituximab (hazard ratio, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.12 to 0.23]; and hazard ratio, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.30 to 0.85], respectively). Patients who received venetoclax-rituximab achieved a higher rate of PB undetectable MRD (uMRD; less than 10<sup>-4</sup>) at EOCT (62% v 13%) with superiority sustained through month 24 (end of therapy). Overall, uMRD status at EOCT predicted longer PFS. Among those with detectable MRD, low-level MRD (10<sup>-4</sup> to less than 10<sup>-2</sup>) predicted improved PFS compared with high-level MRD (10<sup>-2</sup> or greater). At a median of 9.9 months (range, 1.4 to 22.5 months) after completing fixed-duration venetoclax-rituximab, overall only 12% (16 of 130) of patients developed disease progression (11 high-level MRD, three low-level MRD). At the end of therapy, 70% and 98% of patients with uMRD remained in uMRD and without disease progression, respectively. With all patients having finished treatment, continued benefit was observed for venetoclax-rituximab compared with bendamustine-rituximab. uMRD rates were durable and predicted longer PFS, which establishes the impact of PB MRD on the benefit of fixed-duration, venetoclax-containing treatment. Low conversion to detectable MRD and sustained PFS after completion of 2 years of venetoclax-rituximab demonstrate the feasibility of this regimen.","Clinical Trial, Phase III",414.0,35.0,The MURANO study demonstrated significant progression-free survival PFS benefit for fixed-duration venetoclax-rituximab compared with bendamustine-rituximab in relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic With all patients off treatment we report minimal residual disease MRD kinetics and updated outcomes Patients were randomly assigned to 2 years of venetoclax plus rituximab during the first six cycles or six cycles of bendamustine-rituximab Primary end point was PFS Safety and peripheral blood PB MRD status-at cycle 4 2 to 3 months after end of combination therapy EOCT and every 3 to 6 months thereafter-were secondary end points Of 194 patients 174 90 completed the venetoclax-rituximab phase and 130 67 completed 2 years of venetoclax With a median follow-up of 36 months PFS and overall survival remain superior to bendamustine-rituximab hazard ratio 0.16 95 CI 0.12 to 0.23 and hazard ratio 0.50 95 CI 0.30 to 0.85 respectively Patients who received venetoclax-rituximab achieved a higher rate of PB undetectable MRD uMRD less than 10 sup -4 /sup at EOCT 62 v 13 with superiority sustained through month 24 end of therapy Overall uMRD status at EOCT predicted longer PFS Among those with detectable MRD low-level MRD 10 sup -4 /sup to less than 10 sup -2 /sup predicted improved PFS compared with high-level MRD 10 sup -2 /sup or greater At a median of 9.9 months range 1.4 to 22.5 months after completing fixed-duration venetoclax-rituximab overall only 12 16 of 130 of patients developed disease progression 11 high-level MRD three low-level MRD At the end of therapy 70 and 98 of patients with uMRD remained in uMRD and without disease progression respectively With all patients having finished treatment continued benefit was observed for venetoclax-rituximab compared with bendamustine-rituximab uMRD rates were durable and predicted longer PFS which establishes the impact of PB MRD on the benefit of fixed-duration venetoclax-containing treatment Low conversion to detectable MRD and sustained PFS after completion of 2 years of venetoclax-rituximab demonstrate the feasibility of this regimen,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 74138, 45, 264, 93, 91, 115, 25, 300, 247, 9, 1959, 654, 4454, 855, 72, 5, 4809, 855, 4, 591, 430, 442, 1193, 5, 62, 7, 1889, 24, 21, 414, 1048, 753, 34, 2029, 3839, 2, 2939, 123, 7, 11, 1108, 896, 6, 18, 60, 1, 4454, 349, 855, 190, 3, 157, 437, 410, 15, 437, 410, 1, 4809, 855, 86, 396, 741, 10, 300, 367, 2, 672, 315, 3767, 2029, 156, 28, 417, 39, 18, 6, 27, 53, 50, 396, 1, 150, 36, 42202, 2, 454, 27, 6, 49, 53, 3972, 11, 568, 396, 862, 1, 5434, 7, 5811, 424, 781, 3, 4454, 855, 124, 2, 3431, 598, 781, 18, 60, 1, 4454, 5, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 511, 53, 300, 2, 63, 25, 918, 1123, 6, 4809, 855, 360, 197, 13, 245, 48, 58, 13, 133, 6, 13, 382, 2, 360, 197, 13, 212, 48, 58, 13, 201, 6, 13, 772, 106, 7, 54, 103, 4454, 855, 513, 8, 142, 116, 1, 3767, 3920, 2029, 27718, 299, 76, 79, 172, 39, 172, 28, 42202, 744, 603, 233, 5, 5233, 2275, 298, 811, 259, 396, 1, 36, 63, 27718, 156, 28, 42202, 783, 589, 300, 107, 135, 5, 2083, 2029, 154, 301, 2029, 79, 172, 39, 172, 6, 299, 76, 79, 172, 18, 172, 783, 231, 300, 72, 5, 64, 301, 2029, 79, 172, 18, 172, 15, 378, 28, 8, 52, 1, 83, 83, 53, 184, 14, 39, 6, 350, 33, 53, 50, 4144, 1959, 654, 4454, 855, 63, 158, 133, 245, 1, 3431, 1, 7, 276, 34, 91, 175, 64, 301, 2029, 169, 154, 301, 2029, 28, 3, 396, 1, 36, 431, 2, 1096, 1, 7, 5, 27718, 958, 4, 27718, 2, 187, 34, 91, 106, 5, 62, 7, 1041, 20455, 24, 1351, 247, 10, 164, 9, 4454, 855, 72, 5, 4809, 855, 27718, 151, 11, 1480, 2, 783, 589, 300, 92, 7410, 3, 345, 1, 3767, 2029, 23, 3, 247, 1, 1959, 654, 4454, 1101, 24, 154, 3111, 6, 2083, 2029, 2, 2275, 300, 50, 1438, 1, 18, 60, 1, 4454, 855, 608, 3, 1437, 1, 26, 477]",2107.0,30523712,4
Randomized trial of ibrutinib vs ibrutinib plus rituximab in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2018-12-07,"Ibrutinib, an oral covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, is an effective therapy for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To determine whether rituximab provides added benefit to ibrutinib, we conducted a randomized single-center trial of ibrutinib vs ibrutinib plus rituximab. Patients with CLL requiring therapy were randomized to receive 28-day cycles of once-daily ibrutinib 420 mg, either as a single agent (n = 104), or together with rituximab (375 mg/m<sup>2</sup>; n = 104), given weekly during cycle 1, then once per cycle until cycle 6. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intention-to-treat population. We enrolled 208 patients with CLL, 181 with relapsed CLL and 27 treatment-naive patients with high-risk disease (17p deletion or <i>TP53</i> mutation). After a median follow-up of 36 months, the Kaplan-Meier estimates of PFS were 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 76.6-91.9) for patients receiving ibrutinib, and 86.9% (95% CI, 77.3-92.6) for patients receiving ibrutinib plus rituximab. Similarly, response rates were the same in both arms (overall response rate, 92%). However, time to normalization of peripheral blood lymphocyte counts and time to complete remission were shorter, and residual disease levels in the bone marrow were lower, in patients receiving ibrutinib plus rituximab. We conclude that the addition of rituximab to ibrutinib in relapsed and treatment-naive high-risk patients with CLL failed to show improvement in PFS. However, patients treated with ibrutinib plus rituximab reached their remissions faster and achieved significantly lower residual disease levels. Given these results, ibrutinib as single-agent therapy remains current standard-of-care treatment in CLL.

Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia in clonal B-cell disorders: a review.,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,2018-10-01,"Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) have been associated with B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. Here, we review the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of these autoimmune disorders, specifically in the setting of B-cell malignancies. AIHA and ITP are classically associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) but have also been reported in plasmacytic and lymphoproliferative disorders. AIHA includes both warm AIHA and cold agglutinin disease, the latter of which is strongly associated with Waldenström macroglobulinemia. The pathogenesis of these cytopenias varies with the underlying disease, but malignant cells serving as antigen-presenting cells to T lymphocytes, with the generation of autoreactive lymphocytes, may be involved. The diagnosis requires the presence of hemolysis and a positive direct antiglobulin test result.

IGH translocations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Clinicopathologic features and clinical outcomes.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2019-01-08,"The prevalence, clinicopathologic correlates, and outcomes of previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with IGH-BCL2 and IGH-BCL3 translocations are not well known. Using the Mayo Clinic CLL database, we identified patients seen between March 1, 2002 and September 30, 2016 who had FISH testing performed within 3 years of CLL diagnosis. The prognostic profile, time to first therapy (TTT), and overall survival (OS) of patients with IGH-BCL2 and IGH-BCL3 translocation were compared to patients without these abnormalities (non-IGH group). Of 1684 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 38 (2.2%) had IGH-BCL2, and 16 (0.9%) had IGH-BCL3 translocation at diagnosis. Patients with IGH-BCL3 translocation were more likely to have high and very-high CLL-International Prognostic Index, compared to patients with IGH-BCL2 translocation and the non-IGH group. The 5-year probability of requiring therapy was significantly higher for IGH-BCL3 compared to IGH-BCL2 and non-IGH groups (84% vs 33% vs 29%, respectively, P < 0.0001). The 5-year OS was significantly shorter for IGH-BCL3 compared to IGH-BCL2 and non-IGH groups (45% vs 89% vs 86%, respectively, P < 0.0001). On multivariable analyses, IGH-BCL3 translocation was associated with a shorter TTT (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.7; P = 0.005) and shorter OS (HR = 5.5; P < 0.0001); IGH-BCL2 translocation did not impact TTT and OS. In conclusion, approximately 3% of all newly diagnosed CLL patients have either an IGH-BCL2 or IGH-BCL3 translocation. Patients with IGH-BCL3 translocations have a distinct prognostic profile and outcome.

How I manage ibrutinib intolerance and complications in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2019-01-14,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) therapy has changed dramatically with the introduction of several targeted therapeutics. Ibrutinib was the first approved for use in 2014 and now is used for initial and salvage therapy of CLL patients. With its widespread use in clinical practice, ibrutinib's common and uncommon adverse events reported less frequently in earlier clinical trials have been experienced more frequently in real-world practice. In particular, atrial fibrillation, bleeding, infections, and arthralgias have been reported. The management of ibrutinib's adverse events often cannot be generalized but must be individualized to the patient and their long-term risk of additional complications. When ibrutinib was initially developed, there were limited therapeutic alternatives for CLL, which often resulted in treating through the adverse events. At the present time, there are several effective alternative agents available, so transition to an alternative CLL directed therapy may be considered. Given the continued expansion of ibrutinib across many therapeutic areas, investigation of the pathogenesis of adverse events with this agent and also clinical trials examining therapeutic approaches for complications arising during therapy are needed.

Creating novel translation inhibitors to target pro-survival proteins in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Leukemia,Leukemia,2019-01-30,"The viability of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is critically dependent upon staving off death by apoptosis, a hallmark of CLL pathophysiology. The recognition that Mcl-1, a major component of the anti-apoptotic response, is intrinsically short-lived and must be continually resynthesized suggested a novel therapeutic approach. Pateamine A (PatA), a macrolide marine natural product, inhibits cap-dependent translation by binding to the initiation factor eIF4A. In this study, we demonstrated that a synthetic derivative of PatA, des-methyl des-amino PatA (DMDAPatA), blocked mRNA translation, reduced Mcl-1 protein and initiated apoptosis in CLL cells. This action was synergistic with the Bcl-2 antagonist ABT-199. However, avid binding to human plasma proteins limited DMDAPatA potency, precluding further development. To address this, we synthesized a new series of PatA analogs and identified three new leads with potent inhibition of translation.

Long-term follow-up of the RESONATE phase 3 trial of ibrutinib vs ofatumumab.,Blood,Blood,2019-03-06,"Ibrutinib, a once-daily oral inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase, has greatly improved outcomes for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The phase 3 RESONATE trial, which compared single-agent ibrutinib to ofatumumab in high-risk, relapsed patients with CLL, provided support for approval of ibrutinib in the United States and Europe. We describe long-term follow-up of patients treated in RESONATE, where continued superiority of progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.133; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.099-0.178) was observed. Overall survival benefit continues (HR, 0.591; 95% CI, 0.378-0.926), although with decreased magnitude relative to that seen before crossover to ibrutinib was implemented for patients on ofatumumab (HR, 0.426; 95% CI, 0.220-0.823). Notably, overall response to ibrutinib increased over time, with 91% of patients attaining a response. The PFS benefit with ibrutinib was independent of baseline risk factors, although patients with ≥2 prior therapies had shorter PFS than those with <2 prior therapies, and the presence of <i>TP53</i> or <i>SF3B1</i> mutations showed a trend toward shorter PFS vs without these factors. Median duration of ibrutinib was 41 months, with 46% remaining on treatment at a median follow-up of 44 months. Grade ≥3 adverse events generally decreased over time, causing only a small proportion of patients to cease therapy. Ibrutinib was discontinued due to progressive disease in 27% of patients. This long-term study provides support for sustained efficacy and safety of ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory CLL and consideration of study provisions that allow crossover to investigational therapy when benefit has been clearly demonstrated.

Venetoclax dose initially was escalated (100-400 mg) in a 3 + 3 design to define MTD combined with standard-dose obinutuzumab. Patients received venetoclax (schedule A) or obinutuzumab (schedule B) first to compare safety and determine dose/schedule for expansion. Venetoclax-obinutuzumab was administered for 6 cycles, followed by venetoclax monotherapy until disease progression (R/R) or fixed duration 1-year treatment (1L). Fifty R/R and 32 1L patients were enrolled. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Safety, including incidence of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), did not differ between schedules (2 laboratory TLSs per schedule). Schedule B and a 400-mg dose of venetoclax were chosen for expansion. The most common grade 3-4 adverse event was neutropenia (R/R, 58% of patients; 1L, 53%). Rates of grade 3-4 infections were 29% (R/R) and 13% (1L); no fatal infections occurred in 1L.

Mechanism for IL-15-Driven B Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Cycling: Roles for AKT and STAT5 in Modulating Cyclin D2 and DNA Damage Response Proteins.,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",J. Immunol.,2019-04-15,"Clonal expansion of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) occurs within lymphoid tissue pseudofollicles. IL-15, a stromal cell-associated cytokine found within spleens and lymph nodes of B-CLL patients, significantly boosts in vitro cycling of blood-derived B-CLL cells following CpG DNA priming. Both IL-15 and CpG DNA are elevated in microbe-draining lymphatic tissues, and unraveling the basis for IL-15-driven B-CLL growth could illuminate new therapeutic targets. Using CpG DNA-primed human B-CLL clones and approaches involving both immunofluorescent staining and pharmacologic inhibitors, we show that both PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT5 pathways are activated and functionally important for IL-15→CD122/ɣc signaling in ODN-primed cells expressing activated pSTAT3. Furthermore, STAT5 activity must be sustained for continued cycling of CFSE-labeled B-CLL cells. Quantitative RT-PCR experiments with inhibitors of PI3K and STAT5 show that both contribute to IL-15-driven upregulation of mRNA for cyclin D2 and suppression of mRNA for DNA damage response mediators ATM, 53BP1, and MDC1. Furthermore, protein levels of these DNA damage response molecules are reduced by IL-15, as indicated by Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining. Bioinformatics analysis of ENCODE chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data from cell lines provides insight into possible mechanisms for STAT5-mediated repression. Finally, pharmacologic inhibitors of JAKs and STAT5 significantly curtailed B-CLL cycling when added either early or late in a growth response. We discuss how the IL-15-induced changes in gene expression lead to rapid cycling and possibly enhanced mutagenesis.

Efficacy of venetoclax in relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia is influenced by disease and response variables.,Blood,Blood,2019-04-25,"To define the efficacy of venetoclax with extended follow-up and identify clinical or biological treatment effect modifiers, updated data for previously treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) enrolled in 4 early-phase trials were pooled. Rates of response, complete remission (CR/CRi), and undetectable minimal residual disease (U-MRD) were analyzed for all patients (n = 436) and for those patients who were planned to receive 400 mg/day monotherapy (n = 347). Univariate and multiple regression analyses were performed to identify the pretreatment factors associated with response rates and duration of response (DoR). Objective responses were documented in 75% of all patients, including 22% CR/CRi. Overall, 27% and 16% of the patients achieved U-MRD in blood and marrow, respectively. Estimated median progression-free survival (PFS), DoR, and time to progression were 30.2, 38.4, and 36.9 months, respectively. Similar efficacy outcomes were observed within the 400 mg/day monotherapy subset. For those who achieved CR/CRi, the 3-year PFS estimate was 83%. DoR was superior for patients achieving CR/CRi or U-MRD in landmark analyses. In multiple regression analyses, bulky lymphadenopathy (≥5 cm) and refractoriness to B-cell receptor inhibitor (BCRi) therapy were significantly associated with lower CR rate and shorter DoR. Fewer prior therapies were associated with higher CR rate, but not DoR. Chromosome 17p deletion and/or <i>TP53</i> mutation and <i>NOTCH1</i> mutation were consistently associated with shorter DoR, but not probability of response. Thus, both pretreatment factors and depth of response correlated with DoR with venetoclax.

Contrary to common assumptions, CLL significantly affects the life expectancy of older individuals, frequently presenting at a more advanced stage and with more unfavorable features than in the younger population. Therefore, identifying the optimal treatment for these patients is a priority. Older patients with CLL are usually classified as fit, non-fit, or frail based on performance status and comorbidities, and several assessment tools can be used to make these evaluations. While supportive care is appropriate for frail patients, the remaining patients should be treated when indication criteria are met.

Ibrutinib and Venetoclax for First-Line Treatment of CLL.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2019-05-01,"Ibrutinib, an inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, and venetoclax, an inhibitor of B-cell lymphoma 2 protein, have been approved for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Preclinical investigations have indicated potential synergistic interaction of their combination. We conducted an investigator-initiated phase 2 study of combined ibrutinib and venetoclax involving previously untreated high-risk and older patients with CLL. All patients had at least one of the following features: chromosome 17p deletion, mutated <i>TP53</i>, chromosome 11q deletion, unmutated <i>IGHV</i>, or an age of 65 years or older. Patients received ibrutinib monotherapy (420 mg once daily) for 3 cycles, followed by the addition of venetoclax (weekly dose escalation to 400 mg once daily). Combined therapy was administered for 24 cycles. Response assessments were performed according to International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 2008 criteria. Minimal residual disease was assessed by means of multicolor flow cytometry in bone marrow (sensitivity, 10<sup>-4</sup>). A total of 80 patients were treated. The median age was 65 years (range, 26 to 83). A total of 30% of the patients were 70 years of age or older. Overall, 92% of the patients had unmutated <i>IGHV</i>, <i>TP53</i> aberration, or chromosome 11q deletion. With combined treatment, the proportions of patients who had complete remission (with or without normal blood count recovery) and remission with undetectable minimal residual disease increased over time. After 12 cycles of combined treatment, 88% of the patients had complete remission or complete remission with incomplete count recovery, and 61% had remission with undetectable minimal residual disease. Responses were noted in older adults and across all high-risk subgroups. Three patients had laboratory evidence of tumor lysis syndrome.

ROR1-targeted delivery of miR-29b induces cell cycle arrest and therapeutic benefit in vivo in a CLL mouse model.,Blood,Blood,2019-05-31,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) occurs in 2 major forms: aggressive and indolent. Low miR-29b expression in aggressive CLL is associated with poor prognosis. Indiscriminate miR-29b overexpression in the B-lineage of mice causes aberrance, thus warranting the need for selective introduction of miR-29b into B-CLL cells for therapeutic benefit. The oncofetal antigen receptor tyrosine kinase orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) is expressed on malignant B-CLL cells, but not normal B cells, encouraging us with ROR1-targeted delivery for therapeutic miRs. Here, we describe targeted delivery of miR-29b to ROR1<sup>+</sup> CLL cells leading to downregulation of DNMT1 and DNMT3A, modulation of global DNA methylation, decreased SP1, and increased p21 expression in cell lines and primary CLL cells in vitro. Furthermore, using an Eμ-TCL1 mouse model expressing human ROR1, we report the therapeutic benefit of enhanced survival via cellular reprograming by downregulation of DNMT1 and DNMT3A in vivo. Gene expression profiling of engrafted murine leukemia identified reprogramming of cell cycle regulators with decreased SP1 and increased p21 expression after targeted miR-29b treatment. This finding was confirmed by protein modulation, leading to cell cycle arrest and survival benefit in vivo. Importantly, SP1 knockdown results in p21-dependent compensation of the miR-29b effect on cell cycle arrest. These studies form a basis for leukemic cell-targeted delivery of miR-29b as a promising therapeutic approach for CLL and other ROR1<sup>+</sup> B-cell malignancies.",Journal Article,235.0,0.0,Chronic lymphocytic CLL occurs in 2 major forms aggressive and indolent Low miR-29b expression in aggressive CLL is associated with poor prognosis Indiscriminate miR-29b overexpression in the B-lineage of mice causes aberrance thus warranting the need for selective introduction of miR-29b into B-CLL cells for therapeutic benefit The oncofetal antigen receptor tyrosine kinase orphan receptor 1 ROR1 is expressed on malignant B-CLL cells but not normal B cells encouraging us with ROR1-targeted delivery for therapeutic miRs Here we describe targeted delivery of miR-29b to ROR1 sup /sup CLL cells leading to downregulation of DNMT1 and DNMT3A modulation of global DNA methylation decreased SP1 and increased p21 expression in cell lines and primary CLL cells in vitro Furthermore using an Eμ-TCL1 mouse model expressing human ROR1 we report the therapeutic benefit of enhanced survival via cellular reprograming by downregulation of DNMT1 and DNMT3A in vivo Gene expression profiling of engrafted murine identified reprogramming of cell cycle regulators with decreased SP1 and increased p21 expression after targeted miR-29b treatment This finding was confirmed by protein modulation leading to cell cycle arrest and survival benefit in vivo Importantly SP1 knockdown results in p21-dependent compensation of the miR-29b effect on cell cycle arrest These studies form a basis for leukemic cell-targeted delivery of miR-29b as a promising therapeutic approach for CLL and other ROR1 sup /sup B-cell malignancies,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[442, 1193, 552, 1780, 4, 18, 458, 2377, 571, 2, 2316, 154, 722, 9609, 55, 4, 571, 552, 16, 41, 5, 334, 356, 26618, 722, 9609, 851, 4, 3, 132, 2542, 1, 399, 1626, 74842, 631, 7643, 3, 594, 9, 1094, 2456, 1, 722, 9609, 237, 132, 552, 37, 9, 189, 247, 3, 28288, 448, 153, 564, 216, 9814, 153, 14, 9826, 16, 570, 23, 393, 132, 552, 37, 84, 44, 295, 132, 37, 2269, 843, 5, 9826, 238, 989, 9, 189, 7569, 467, 21, 897, 238, 989, 1, 722, 9609, 6, 9826, 172, 172, 552, 37, 1049, 6, 2475, 1, 7328, 2, 6199, 2356, 1, 1648, 261, 569, 340, 5557, 2, 101, 2657, 55, 4, 31, 285, 2, 86, 552, 37, 4, 439, 798, 75, 35, 17467, 8979, 830, 202, 1046, 171, 9826, 21, 414, 3, 189, 247, 1, 651, 25, 847, 763, 42081, 20, 2475, 1, 7328, 2, 6199, 4, 386, 145, 55, 1080, 1, 6914, 1471, 108, 7394, 1, 31, 417, 3196, 5, 340, 5557, 2, 101, 2657, 55, 50, 238, 722, 9609, 24, 26, 1567, 10, 557, 20, 178, 2356, 1049, 6, 31, 417, 1854, 2, 25, 247, 4, 386, 1859, 5557, 1563, 99, 4, 2657, 470, 19095, 1, 3, 722, 9609, 254, 23, 31, 417, 1854, 46, 94, 1297, 8, 877, 9, 2015, 31, 238, 989, 1, 722, 9609, 22, 8, 721, 189, 353, 9, 552, 2, 127, 9826, 172, 172, 132, 31, 441]",1512.0,31151986,403
"Ibrutinib plus fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab as initial treatment for younger patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia: a single-arm, multicentre, phase 2 trial.",The Lancet. Haematology,Lancet Haematol,2019-06-14,"Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) can improve disease-free survival for younger (age ≤65 years) fit patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with mutated IGHV. However, patients with unmutated IGHV rarely have durable responses. Ibrutinib is active for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia irrespective of IGHV mutation status but requires continuous treatment. We postulated that time-limited ibrutinib plus FCR would induce durable responses in younger fit patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. We did a multicentre, open-label, non-randomised, single-arm phase 2 trial at seven sites in the USA. We enrolled patients aged 65 years or younger with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Our initial cohort (original cohort) was not restricted by prognostic marker status and included patients who had del(17p) or TP53 aberrations. After a protocol amendment (on March 21, 2017), we enrolled an additional cohort (expansion cohort) that included patients without del(17p). Ibrutinib was given orally (420 mg/day) for 7 days, then up to six 28-day cycles were administered intravenously of fludarabine (25 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, days 1-3), cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, days 1-3), and rituximab (375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> day 1 of cycle 1; 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> day 1 of cycles 2-6) with continuous oral ibrutinib (420 mg/day). Responders continued on ibrutinib maintenance for up to 2 years, and patients with undetectable minimal residual disease in bone marrow after 2 years were able to discontinue treatment. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a complete response with undetectable minimal residual disease in bone marrow 2 months after the last cycle of ibrutinib plus FCR. Analyses were done per-protocol in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02251548) and is ongoing. Between Oct 23, 2014, and April 23, 2018, 85 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were enrolled. del(17p) was detected in four (5%) of 83 patients and TP53 mutations were noted in three (4%) of 81 patients; two patients had both del(17p) and TP53 mutations. Median patients' age was 55 years (IQR 50-58). At data cutoff, median follow-up was 16·5 months (IQR 10·6-34·1). A complete response and undetectable minimal residual disease in bone marrow 2 months after the last cycle of ibrutinib plus FCR was achieved by 28 (33%, 95% CI 0·23-0·44) of 85 patients (p=0·0035 compared with a 20% historical value with FCR alone). A best response of undetectable minimal residual disease in bone marrow was achieved by 71 (84%) of 85 patients during the study. One patient had disease progression and one patient died (sudden cardiac death after 17 months of ibrutinib maintenance, assessed as possibly related to ibrutinib). The most common all-grade toxic effects were haematological, including thrombocytopenia in 63 (74%) patients, neutropenia in 53 (62%), and anaemia in 41 (49%). Grade 3 or 4 non-haematological serious adverse events included grade 3 atrial fibrillation in three (4%) patients and grade 3 Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in two (2%). The proportion of patients who achieved undetectable minimal residual disease in bone marrow with ibrutinib plus FCR is, to our knowledge, the highest ever published in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia unrestricted by prognostic marker status.

Targeting BCL2 in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Other Hematologic Malignancies.,Drugs,Drugs,2019-08-01,"Apoptosis, the process of programmed cell death, occurs normally during development and aging. Members of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) family of proteins are central regulators of apoptosis, and resistance to apoptosis is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Targeting the apoptotic pathway via BCL2 inhibitors has been considered a promising treatment strategy in the past decade. Initial efforts with small molecule BH3 mimetics such as ABT-737 and ABT-263 (navitoclax) pioneered the development of the first-in-class Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved oral BCL2 inhibitor, venetoclax.

Ibrutinib-Rituximab or Chemoimmunotherapy for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2019-08-01,"Data regarding the efficacy of treatment with ibrutinib-rituximab, as compared with standard chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab, in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have been limited. In a phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) patients 70 years of age or younger with previously untreated CLL to receive either ibrutinib and rituximab for six cycles (after a single cycle of ibrutinib alone), followed by ibrutinib until disease progression, or six cycles of chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. The primary end point was progression-free survival, and overall survival was a secondary end point. We report the results of a planned interim analysis. A total of 529 patients underwent randomization (354 patients to the ibrutinib-rituximab group, and 175 to the chemoimmunotherapy group). At a median follow-up of 33.6 months, the results of the analysis of progression-free survival favored ibrutinib-rituximab over chemoimmunotherapy (89.4% vs. 72.9% at 3 years; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22 to 0.56; P<0.001), and the results met the protocol-defined efficacy threshold for the interim analysis. The results of the analysis of overall survival also favored ibrutinib-rituximab over chemoimmunotherapy (98.8% vs. 91.5% at 3 years; hazard ratio for death, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.54; P<0.001). In a subgroup analysis involving patients without immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (<i>IGHV</i>) mutation, ibrutinib-rituximab resulted in better progression-free survival than chemoimmunotherapy (90.7% vs. 62.5% at 3 years; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.50). The 3-year progression-free survival among patients with <i>IGHV</i> mutation was 87.7% in the ibrutinib-rituximab group and 88.0% in the chemoimmunotherapy group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.14 to 1.36). The incidence of adverse events of grade 3 or higher (regardless of attribution) was similar in the two groups (in 282 of 352 patients [80.1%] who received ibrutinib-rituximab and in 126 of 158 [79.7%] who received chemoimmunotherapy), whereas infectious complications of grade 3 or higher were less common with ibrutinib-rituximab than with chemoimmunotherapy (in 37 patients [10.5%] vs. 32 [20.3%], P<0.001). The ibrutinib-rituximab regimen resulted in progression-free survival and overall survival that were superior to those with a standard chemoimmunotherapy regimen among patients 70 years of age or younger with previously untreated CLL.
