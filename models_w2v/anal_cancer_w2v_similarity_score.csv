Surgical treatment of high-grade anal squamous intraepithelial lesions: a prospective study.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2002-04-01,"The prevalence of anal squamous intraepithelial lesions is high among human immunodeficiency virus-positive homosexual males and, to a lesser extent, among human immunodeficiency virus-negative homosexual males. Furthermore, the incidence of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, the putative precursor lesion to invasive cancer, is also high. We report the first prospective study of high-resolution anoscopy-directed surgical treatment of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. A prospective study of patients undergoing surgical treatment of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (excision/cauterization of lesions visualized with high-resolution anoscopy) was performed. Follow-up anoscopy with biopsy and Papanicolaou smear was performed every three to six months. Patients diagnosed with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions during the course of their participation in a prospective cohort study of anal squamous intraepithelial lesions were identified. From this group, 37 patients who were treated surgically between 1995 and 1999 were studied. Of these, 29 had tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus and 8 were negative for the virus. Mean patient age was 45 +/- 8 years. Mean duration of follow-up was 32.3 +/- 20.6 months in the human immunodeficiency virus-negative group and 28.6 +/- 12.9 months in the human immunodeficiency virus-positive group. No human immunodeficiency virus-negative patient developed recurrent high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. Twenty-three of 29 human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients had persistent or recurrent high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (P = 0.003; mean time to recurrence, 12 months). Six patients underwent reoperation for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (4 recurred by 6 months). No patients developed incontinence, stenosis, postoperative infection, or significant bleeding after surgical treatment. Surgical intervention directed by high-resolution anoscopy is safe and eliminates high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions in human immunodeficiency virus-negative patients. The high persistence or recurrence rate in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients suggests that multiple staged procedures and continued surveillance may be necessary.",Clinical Trial,6504.0,168.0,The prevalence of squamous intraepithelial lesions is high among human immunodeficiency virus-positive homosexual males and to a lesser extent among human immunodeficiency virus-negative homosexual males Furthermore the incidence of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions the putative precursor lesion to invasive cancer is also high We report the first prospective study of high-resolution anoscopy-directed surgical treatment of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions A prospective study of patients undergoing surgical treatment of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions excision/cauterization of lesions visualized with high-resolution anoscopy was performed Follow-up anoscopy with biopsy and Papanicolaou smear was performed every three to six months Patients diagnosed with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions during the course of their participation in a prospective cohort study of squamous intraepithelial lesions were identified From this group 37 patients who were treated surgically between 1995 and 1999 were studied Of these 29 had tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus and 8 were negative for the virus Mean patient age was 45 +/- 8 years Mean duration of follow-up was 32.3 +/- 20.6 months in the human immunodeficiency virus-negative group and 28.6 +/- 12.9 months in the human immunodeficiency virus-positive group No human immunodeficiency virus-negative patient developed recurrent high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions Twenty-three of 29 human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients had persistent or recurrent high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions P 0.003 mean time to recurrence 12 months Six patients underwent reoperation for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions 4 recurred by 6 months No patients developed incontinence stenosis postoperative infection or significant bleeding after surgical treatment Surgical intervention directed by high-resolution anoscopy is safe and eliminates high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions in human immunodeficiency virus-negative patients The high persistence or recurrence rate in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients suggests that multiple staged procedures and continued surveillance may be necessary,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1078, 1, 691, 4153, 406, 16, 64, 107, 171, 5323, 1450, 109, 42918, 2296, 2, 6, 8, 5191, 1039, 107, 171, 5323, 1450, 199, 42918, 2296, 798, 3, 287, 1, 64, 88, 691, 4153, 406, 3, 2743, 2765, 1180, 6, 416, 12, 16, 120, 64, 21, 414, 3, 157, 482, 45, 1, 64, 2125, 21979, 1166, 221, 24, 1, 64, 88, 691, 4153, 406, 8, 482, 45, 1, 7, 479, 221, 24, 1, 64, 88, 691, 4153, 406, 1366, 42919, 1, 406, 6326, 5, 64, 2125, 21979, 10, 173, 166, 126, 21979, 5, 411, 2, 10416, 8379, 10, 173, 454, 169, 6, 437, 53, 7, 265, 5, 64, 88, 691, 4153, 406, 190, 3, 906, 1, 136, 2599, 4, 8, 482, 180, 45, 1, 691, 4153, 406, 11, 108, 29, 26, 87, 567, 7, 54, 11, 73, 2350, 59, 2323, 2, 2043, 11, 656, 1, 46, 462, 42, 650, 109, 9, 171, 5323, 1450, 2, 66, 11, 199, 9, 3, 1450, 313, 69, 89, 10, 512, 66, 60, 313, 654, 1, 166, 126, 10, 531, 27, 179, 49, 53, 4, 3, 171, 5323, 1450, 199, 87, 2, 339, 49, 133, 83, 53, 4, 3, 171, 5323, 1450, 109, 87, 77, 171, 5323, 1450, 199, 69, 276, 387, 64, 88, 691, 4153, 406, 737, 169, 1, 462, 171, 5323, 1450, 109, 7, 42, 1882, 15, 387, 64, 88, 691, 4153, 406, 19, 13, 1421, 313, 98, 6, 146, 133, 53, 437, 7, 208, 5077, 9, 64, 88, 691, 4153, 406, 39, 3363, 20, 49, 53, 77, 7, 276, 6152, 6935, 573, 930, 15, 93, 2294, 50, 221, 24, 221, 788, 1166, 20, 64, 2125, 21979, 16, 1165, 2, 10794, 64, 88, 691, 4153, 406, 4, 171, 5323, 1450, 199, 7, 3, 64, 4108, 15, 146, 116, 4, 171, 5323, 1450, 109, 7, 844, 17, 232, 2930, 1369, 2, 1351, 617, 68, 40, 1493]",2234.0,12006924,47
Sphincter-sparing local excision and adjuvant radiation for anal-rectal melanoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2002-12-01,"To evaluate the outcome and toxicity of a sphincter-sparing treatment strategy in the management of patients with anal-rectal melanoma. Between 1989 and 2000, 23 patients with invasive anal-rectal melanoma were managed with sphincter-sparing surgical resection and adjuvant radiation. Surgery consisted of primary local excision, as well as dissection for patients with documented regional nodal disease. Adjuvant radiation was delivered using a hypofractionated regimen of 30 Gy in five fractions over 2.5 weeks. Adjuvant systemic therapy was delivered to nine patients: cytotoxic chemotherapy in seven and immunotherapy in two. After a median follow-up of 32 months, 15 patients had relapsed and 15 patients had died. The actuarial 5-year overall, disease-specific, disease-free, and distant metastasis-free survival rates were 31%, 36%, 37%, and 35%, respectively. The actuarial 5-year local and regional nodal control rates were 74% and 84%, respectively. No patient had locoregional failure as the sole site of failure and no patient required salvage abdominoperineal resection (APR). By univariate analysis, patients with nodal disease at presentation had a decreased actuarial 5-year disease-specific (0% v 45%, P =.004), disease-free (0% v 45%, P <.001), and distant metastasis-free survival (0% v 42%, P <.001). The actuarial complication-free survival rate was 71%.

Adequacy of 1-cm distal margin after restorative rectal cancer resection with sharp mesorectal excision and preoperative combined-modality therapy.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,,"Preoperative combined-modality therapy (CMT) for rectal cancer allows a sphincter-sparing procedure in some individuals who would otherwise require an abdominoperineal resection. To further define the subset of rectal cancer patients suitable for this approach, we determined the adequacy of a distal margin of < or = 1 cm in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer requiring preoperative CMT. Ninety-four consecutive patients, status post curative low anterior resection for rectal cancer after preoperative CMT, were identified from the prospective Colorectal Service Database. Distal margin length, tumor grade, tumor-node-metastasis stage, presence of lymphovascular and perineural invasion, and tumor distance from the anal verge were examined for their effect on recurrence and survival. Median follow-up was 44 months. Distal margin length ranged from.1 to 9.5 cm (median, 2.0 cm) and did not correlate with local recurrence (hazard ratio, 1.1; P =.34) or recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.1; P =.29) by univariate analysis.

Response to preoperative chemoradiation increases the use of sphincter-preserving surgery in patients with locally advanced low rectal carcinoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2003-01-01,"Although controversial, some believe that preoperative chemoradiation increases the use of sphincter-preserving surgery in low rectal carcinoma patients. This article investigates the relationship between objective tumor response and sphincter preservation in low rectal carcinoma patients. The authors reviewed the records of 238 patients with T3 or T4 low rectal carcinoma (< or = 6 cm from the anal verge) who underwent preoperative pelvic chemoradiation (45 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks, n = 182 or 52.5 Gy/30 fractions/5 weeks, n = 56 with continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil at 300 mg/m(2), Monday to Friday) followed by mesorectal (n = 223) or local excision (n = 15). A logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the influence of objective tumor response (defined as complete clinical response) and other prognostic factors on sphincter preservation. Because degrees of partial response could not be objectively defined retrospectively, the influence of partial response on sphincter preservation could not be evaluated. Overall, 49% of patients (117 of 238) had sphincter-preserving surgery. The clinical complete response rate was 47%. Independent predictors of sphincter preservation included the year of surgery, tumor distance from the anal verge, circumferential tumor involvement, and response to chemoradiation. The sphincter preservation rate increased over the period of the study (from 28% [December 1989 to December 1992] to 44% [January 1993 to December 1996] to 67% [January 1997 to December 2000]). The difference in the rates of sphincter preservation according to response was most striking among patients with tumors 3 cm or less from the anal verge (44% vs. 22%, P = 0.01). The pelvic disease recurrence rate among patients undergoing sphincter-preserving surgery has been less than 10% since January 1993 and was not statistically different between the groups treated from January 1993 to December 1996 and from January 1997 to December 2000.

Chemoradiation for adenocarcinoma of the anus.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2003-03-01,"To assess the efficacy and limitations of definitive chemoradiation for adenocarcinoma of the anal canal and to propose a treatment strategy that addresses the limitations of treatment. Between 1976 and 1998, 16 patients with localized adenocarcinoma of the anal canal were treated with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy with curative intent. Available histologic slides were reviewed for evidence of primary adenocarcinoma of anal duct origin. The treatment results for these patients were compared with those of a group of patients with epidermoid histologic features who were all treated with definitive chemoradiation (55 Gy with concurrent 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin, n = 92) between 1989 and 1998. The hospital records were reviewed for all patients. Patients with epidermoid carcinoma presented with more advanced primary tumors (42% vs. 19% Stage T3 or greater). All adenocarcinoma patients were treated with radiotherapy (median dose 55 Gy): 11 received concurrent 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy and 5 received radiotherapy alone. The initial surgical procedures included abdominoperineal resection, excisional biopsies (n = 5), and local excision (n = 1). Abdominoperineal resection was performed as salvage therapy after local recurrence in 5 patients. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate 5-year actuarial pelvic control, distant disease control, disease-free survival, and overall survival. The median follow-up was 45 months (range 5-196) for patients with adenocarcinoma and 44 months (range 9-115) for patients with epidermoid histologic features. Both local and distant recurrence rates were significantly greater in the adenocarcinoma patients. Of 16 patients with adenocarcinoma, 7 (5-year actuarial rate 54%) had recurrence at the primary site compared with 16 (5-year actuarial rate 18%) of 92 patients with epidermoid histologic features (p = 0.004). Distant disease developed in more patients with adenocarcinoma (5-year actuarial rate 66%) than in patients with epidermoid carcinoma (5-year actuarial rate 10%, p <0.001). The 5-year actuarial disease-free survival and overall survival rate for adenocarcinoma patients was 19% and 64%, respectively, compared with 77% (p <0.0001) and 85% (p = 0.017) for those with epidermoid carcinoma. Patients with localized adenocarcinoma of the anus treated with definitive chemoradiation had high rates of pelvic failure and distant metastasis compared with comparably staged patients with epidermoid histologic features treated similarly. On the basis of these limitations, we recommend preoperative chemoradiation followed by abdominoperineal resection to maximize pelvic disease control and consideration of adjuvant chemotherapy to address the problem of micrometastatic disease.",Comparative Study,6170.0,47.0,To assess the efficacy and limitations of definitive chemoradiation for adenocarcinoma of the canal and to propose a treatment strategy that addresses the limitations of treatment Between 1976 and 1998 16 patients with localized adenocarcinoma of the canal were treated with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy with curative intent Available histologic slides were reviewed for evidence of primary adenocarcinoma of duct origin The treatment results for these patients were compared with those of a group of patients with epidermoid histologic features who were all treated with definitive chemoradiation 55 Gy with concurrent 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin n 92 between 1989 and 1998 The hospital records were reviewed for all patients Patients with epidermoid carcinoma presented with more advanced primary tumors 42 vs. 19 Stage T3 or greater All adenocarcinoma patients were treated with radiotherapy median dose 55 Gy 11 received concurrent 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy and 5 received radiotherapy alone The initial surgical procedures included abdominoperineal resection excisional biopsies n 5 and local excision n 1 Abdominoperineal resection was performed as salvage therapy after local recurrence in 5 patients The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate 5-year actuarial pelvic control distant disease control disease-free survival and overall survival The median follow-up was 45 months range 5-196 for patients with adenocarcinoma and 44 months range 9-115 for patients with epidermoid histologic features Both local and distant recurrence rates were significantly greater in the adenocarcinoma patients Of 16 patients with adenocarcinoma 7 5-year actuarial rate 54 had recurrence at the primary site compared with 16 5-year actuarial rate 18 of 92 patients with epidermoid histologic features p 0.004 Distant disease developed in more patients with adenocarcinoma 5-year actuarial rate 66 than in patients with epidermoid carcinoma 5-year actuarial rate 10 p 0.001 The 5-year actuarial disease-free survival and overall survival rate for adenocarcinoma patients was 19 and 64 respectively compared with 77 p 0.0001 and 85 p 0.017 for those with epidermoid carcinoma Patients with localized adenocarcinoma of the anus treated with definitive chemoradiation had high rates of pelvic failure and distant metastasis compared with comparably staged patients with epidermoid histologic features treated similarly On the basis of these limitations we recommend preoperative chemoradiation followed by abdominoperineal resection to maximize pelvic disease control and consideration of adjuvant chemotherapy to address the problem of micrometastatic disease,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 423, 3, 209, 2, 1939, 1, 1057, 975, 9, 449, 1, 3, 5614, 2, 6, 2548, 8, 24, 692, 17, 5437, 3, 1939, 1, 24, 59, 8586, 2, 1850, 245, 7, 5, 909, 449, 1, 3, 5614, 11, 73, 5, 310, 5, 15, 187, 56, 5, 1075, 1697, 390, 884, 3830, 11, 446, 9, 241, 1, 86, 449, 1, 2920, 1938, 3, 24, 99, 9, 46, 7, 11, 72, 5, 135, 1, 8, 87, 1, 7, 5, 13277, 884, 404, 54, 11, 62, 73, 5, 1057, 975, 614, 381, 5, 750, 33, 1404, 2, 540, 78, 937, 59, 3965, 2, 1850, 3, 702, 1064, 11, 446, 9, 62, 7, 7, 5, 13277, 134, 917, 5, 80, 131, 86, 57, 595, 105, 326, 82, 2065, 15, 378, 62, 449, 7, 11, 73, 5, 310, 52, 61, 614, 381, 175, 103, 750, 33, 1404, 90, 56, 2, 33, 103, 310, 279, 3, 388, 221, 1369, 159, 8177, 170, 6488, 1154, 78, 33, 2, 293, 1366, 78, 14, 8177, 170, 10, 173, 22, 992, 36, 50, 293, 146, 4, 33, 7, 3, 876, 882, 596, 10, 95, 6, 3232, 33, 111, 2361, 1110, 182, 626, 34, 182, 34, 115, 25, 2, 63, 25, 3, 52, 166, 126, 10, 512, 53, 184, 33, 6369, 9, 7, 5, 449, 2, 584, 53, 184, 83, 3670, 9, 7, 5, 13277, 884, 404, 110, 293, 2, 626, 146, 151, 11, 97, 378, 4, 3, 449, 7, 1, 245, 7, 5, 449, 67, 33, 111, 2361, 116, 667, 42, 146, 28, 3, 86, 606, 72, 5, 245, 33, 111, 2361, 116, 203, 1, 937, 7, 5, 13277, 884, 404, 19, 13, 1520, 626, 34, 276, 4, 80, 7, 5, 449, 33, 111, 2361, 116, 700, 76, 4, 7, 5, 13277, 134, 33, 111, 2361, 116, 79, 19, 13, 144, 3, 33, 111, 2361, 34, 115, 25, 2, 63, 25, 116, 9, 449, 7, 10, 326, 2, 660, 106, 72, 5, 849, 19, 13, 488, 2, 772, 19, 13, 3825, 9, 135, 5, 13277, 134, 7, 5, 909, 449, 1, 3, 15178, 73, 5, 1057, 975, 42, 64, 151, 1, 1110, 496, 2, 626, 278, 72, 5, 15105, 2930, 7, 5, 13277, 884, 404, 73, 1813, 23, 3, 877, 1, 46, 1939, 21, 2237, 498, 975, 370, 20, 8177, 170, 6, 4116, 1110, 34, 182, 2, 2415, 1, 249, 56, 6, 1539, 3, 2497, 1, 7993, 34]",2673.0,12573754,82
Current perspectives on anal cancer.,"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)","Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",2003-04-01,"Anal cancer accounts for 1.5% of digestive system malignancies in the United States. In the past 30 years, substantial progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiology and treatment of the disease. Anal cancer was once believed to be caused by chronic local inflammation of the perianal area, and treatment was abdominoperineal resection. From epidemiologic and clinical studies, we now know that the development of anal cancer is associated with human papillomavirus infection and that the disease has a pathophysiology similar to that of cervical cancer. Less invasive treatments have also been developed, and the majority of patients with anal cancer can now be cured with preservation of the anal sphincter using concurrent external-beam radiation therapy and fluorouracil (5-FU)/mitomycin (Mutamycin) chemotherapy.

Evaluation of preoperative and postoperative radiotherapy on long-term functional results of straight coloanal anastomosis.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2003-07-01,"Preoperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer avoids radiation to the reconstructed rectum and may circumvent the detrimental effects on bowel function associated with postoperative radiotherapy. We compared the long-term functional results of patients who received preoperative radiotherapy, postoperative radiotherapy, or no radiotherapy in conjunction with low anterior resection and coloanal anastomosis to assess the impact of pelvic radiation on anorectal function. One hundred nine patients treated by low anterior resection and straight coloanal anastomosis for rectal cancer between 1986 and 1997 were assessed with a standardized questionnaire at two to eight years after resection. All radiotherapy was given to a total dose of 4,500 to 5,400 cGy with conventional doses and techniques. Most patients received concurrent 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. There were 39 patients in the preoperative radiotherapy group, 11 patients in the postoperative radiotherapy group, and 59 patients in the no radiotherapy group. The postoperative radiotherapy group reported a significantly greater number of bowel movements per 24-hour period (P < 0.01) and significantly more episodes of clustered bowel movements (P < 0.02) than either the preoperative radiotherapy group or the no radiotherapy group. No significant difference in anal continence or satisfaction with bowel function was found among the three groups. In this study of straight (nonreservoir) coloanal anastomoses, postoperative pelvic radiotherapy had significant adverse effects on anorectal function, with higher rates of clustering and frequency of defecation than with preoperative radiotherapy.

"The addition of continuous infusion 5-FU to preoperative radiation therapy increases tumor response, leading to increased sphincter preservation in locally advanced rectal cancer.","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2003-09-01,"To compare the outcome from preoperative chemoradiation (CXRT) and from radiation therapy (RT) in the treatment of rectal cancer in two large, single-institutional experiences. Between 1978 and 1995, 403 patients with localized, nonmetastatic, clinically staged T3 or T4 rectal cancer patients were treated with preoperative RT alone at two institutions. Patients at institution 1 (n = 207) were treated with pelvic CXRT exclusively, and patients at institution 2 were treated (except for 8 given CXRT) with pelvic RT alone (n = 196). In addition, a third group (n = 61) was treated with CXRT at institution 2 between 1998 and 2000 after a policy change. Both institutions delivered 45 Gy in five fractions as a standard dose, but institution 2 used 20 Gy in five fractions in selected cases (n = 26). At both institutions, concurrent chemotherapy consisted of a continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) at a dosage of 1500 mg/m(2)/week. The end points were response, sphincter preservation (SP), relapse-free survival (RFS), pelvic disease control (PC), and overall survival (OS). Median follow-up was 63 months for all living patients at institution 1 and in the primary group of institution 2. Multivariate analysis of the patients in these groups showed that the use of concurrent chemotherapy improved tumor response (T-stage downstaging, 62% vs. 42%, p = 0.001, and pathologic complete response, 23% vs. 5% p < 0.0001), but did not significantly improve LC, RFS, or OS. Follow-up for the secondary group at institution 2 was insufficient to allow the analysis of these endpoints. In the subset of patients receiving 45 Gy who had rectal tumors < or /=6 cm from the anal verge (institution 1: n = 132; institution 2 primary: n = 79; institution 2 secondary: n = 33), there was a significant improvement in SP with the use of concurrent chemotherapy (39% at institution 1 compared with 13% in the primary group at institution 2, p < 0.0001). A logistic regression analysis of clinical prognostic factors indicated that the use of concurrent chemotherapy independently influenced SP in these low tumors (p = 0.002). This finding was supported by a 36% SP rate in the secondary group at institution 2. Thus SP increased after the addition of chemotherapy at institution 2. The use of concurrent 5-FU with preoperative radiation therapy for T3 and T4 rectal cancer independently increases tumor response and may contribute to increased SP in patients with low rectal cancer.",Comparative Study,5986.0,102.0,To compare the outcome from preoperative chemoradiation CXRT and from radiation therapy RT in the treatment of cancer in two large single-institutional experiences Between 1978 and 1995 403 patients with localized nonmetastatic clinically staged T3 or T4 cancer patients were treated with preoperative RT alone at two institutions Patients at institution 1 n 207 were treated with pelvic CXRT exclusively and patients at institution 2 were treated except for 8 given CXRT with pelvic RT alone n 196 In addition a third group n 61 was treated with CXRT at institution 2 between 1998 and 2000 after a policy change Both institutions delivered 45 Gy in five fractions as a standard dose but institution 2 used 20 Gy in five fractions in selected cases n 26 At both institutions concurrent chemotherapy consisted of a continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil 5-FU at a dosage of 1500 mg/m 2 /week The end points were response sphincter preservation SP relapse-free survival RFS pelvic disease control PC and overall survival OS Median follow-up was 63 months for all living patients at institution 1 and in the primary group of institution 2 Multivariate analysis of the patients in these groups showed that the use of concurrent chemotherapy improved tumor response T-stage downstaging 62 vs. 42 p 0.001 and pathologic complete response 23 vs. 5 p 0.0001 but did not significantly improve LC RFS or OS Follow-up for the secondary group at institution 2 was insufficient to allow the analysis of these endpoints In the subset of patients receiving 45 Gy who had tumors or /=6 cm from the verge institution 1 n 132 institution 2 primary n 79 institution 2 secondary n 33 there was a significant improvement in SP with the use of concurrent chemotherapy 39 at institution 1 compared with 13 in the primary group at institution 2 p 0.0001 A logistic regression analysis of clinical prognostic factors indicated that the use of concurrent chemotherapy independently influenced SP in these low tumors p 0.002 This finding was supported by a 36 SP rate in the secondary group at institution 2 Thus SP increased after the addition of chemotherapy at institution 2 The use of concurrent 5-FU with preoperative radiation therapy for T3 and T4 cancer independently increases tumor response and may contribute to increased SP in patients with low cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[6, 932, 3, 228, 29, 498, 975, 7925, 2, 29, 121, 36, 240, 4, 3, 24, 1, 12, 4, 100, 375, 226, 1115, 4031, 59, 11799, 2, 2323, 10836, 7, 5, 909, 2683, 505, 2930, 2065, 15, 2463, 12, 7, 11, 73, 5, 498, 240, 279, 28, 100, 1764, 7, 28, 731, 14, 78, 5292, 11, 73, 5, 1110, 7925, 4437, 2, 7, 28, 731, 18, 11, 73, 2187, 9, 66, 447, 7925, 5, 1110, 240, 279, 78, 6369, 4, 352, 8, 1282, 87, 78, 713, 10, 73, 5, 7925, 28, 731, 18, 59, 1850, 2, 1081, 50, 8, 4196, 707, 110, 1764, 1623, 512, 381, 4, 365, 1550, 22, 8, 260, 61, 84, 731, 18, 95, 179, 381, 4, 365, 1550, 4, 715, 140, 78, 432, 28, 110, 1764, 750, 56, 1695, 1, 8, 1314, 904, 1, 33, 1404, 33, 1296, 28, 8, 3323, 1, 7204, 81, 188, 18, 647, 3, 396, 862, 11, 51, 5400, 2224, 4074, 429, 115, 25, 1272, 1110, 34, 182, 1341, 2, 63, 25, 118, 52, 166, 126, 10, 676, 53, 9, 62, 2798, 7, 28, 731, 14, 2, 4, 3, 86, 87, 1, 731, 18, 331, 65, 1, 3, 7, 4, 46, 271, 224, 17, 3, 119, 1, 750, 56, 231, 30, 51, 102, 82, 5336, 744, 105, 595, 19, 13, 144, 2, 510, 236, 51, 382, 105, 33, 19, 13, 488, 84, 205, 44, 97, 401, 1837, 1272, 15, 118, 166, 126, 9, 3, 568, 87, 28, 731, 18, 10, 3027, 6, 1700, 3, 65, 1, 46, 1387, 4, 3, 697, 1, 7, 357, 512, 381, 54, 42, 57, 15, 49, 494, 29, 3, 8330, 731, 14, 78, 4255, 731, 18, 86, 78, 842, 731, 18, 568, 78, 466, 125, 10, 8, 93, 767, 4, 4074, 5, 3, 119, 1, 750, 56, 587, 28, 731, 14, 72, 5, 233, 4, 3, 86, 87, 28, 731, 18, 19, 13, 488, 8, 812, 320, 65, 1, 38, 177, 130, 1103, 17, 3, 119, 1, 750, 56, 1042, 2574, 4074, 4, 46, 154, 57, 19, 13, 1111, 26, 1567, 10, 2708, 20, 8, 511, 4074, 116, 4, 3, 568, 87, 28, 731, 18, 631, 4074, 101, 50, 3, 352, 1, 56, 28, 731, 18, 3, 119, 1, 750, 33, 1296, 5, 498, 121, 36, 9, 2065, 2, 2463, 12, 1042, 1106, 30, 51, 2, 68, 1248, 6, 101, 4074, 4, 7, 5, 154, 12]",2335.0,12909219,80

Impact of hospital procedure volume on surgical operation and long-term outcomes in high-risk curatively resected rectal cancer: findings from the Intergroup 0114 Study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2004-01-01,"Prior studies have demonstrated superior outcomes after a curative surgical resection of rectal cancer at hospitals where the volume of such surgeries is high. However, because these studies often lack detailed information on tumor and treatment characteristics as well as cancer recurrence, the true nature of this relation remains uncertain. We studied a nested cohort of 1,330 patients with stage II and stage III rectal cancer participating in a multicenter, adjuvant chemoradiotherapy trial. We analyzed differences in rates of sphincter-preserving operations, overall survival, and cancer recurrence by hospital surgical volume. We observed a significant difference in the rates of abdominoperineal resections across tertiles of hospital procedure volume (46.3% for patients resected at low-volume, 41.3% at medium-volume, and 31.8% at high-volume hospitals; P <.0001), even after adjustment for tumor distance from the anal verge. However, this higher rate of sphincter-sparing operations at high-volume centers was not accompanied by any increase in recurrence rates. Hospital surgical volume did not predict overall, disease-free, recurrence-free, or local recurrence-free survival. However, among patients who did not complete the planned adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (270 patients), those who underwent surgery at low-volume hospitals had a significant increase in cancer recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.01 to 3.72; P =.04 for the trend) and a nonsignificant trend toward increased overall mortality (P =.08) and local recurrence (P =.10).

Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal margin.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2004-05-01,"To define the optimal treatment of patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) of the anal margin. Nineteen patients treated with curative intent by radiotherapy (RT) alone or combined with adjuvant chemotherapy (CTX) between 1979 and June 2000 were analyzed. The pertinent literature was reviewed and discussed as it related to our experience. Local control after RT or RT and CTX was observed in all 19 patients (100%). One T1 patient developed inguinal lymph node metastases and subsequently died secondary to regional and distant disease. This patient did not receive elective inguinal node RT; the lymph nodes of the other 18 patients in this analysis were irradiated. Four patients died of intercurrent disease at 25, 29, 37, and 113 months after RT, respectively. The remaining 14 patients were alive and disease-free from 52 to 143 months after treatment. No patient suffered a severe complication or required a diverting colostomy or an abdominoperineal resection (APR) after treatment. Review of the literature reveals that the probability of cure is similar after RT alone or combined with CTX compared with surgery. Therefore, the choice of treatment depends on the anticipated functional result. Patients with SCCA of the anal margin have a high likelihood of cure with sphincter preservation after RT or RT and CTX. Patients with well to moderately differentiated T1 tumors may undergo excision if it can be accomplished without compromising the sphincter. The remainder are treated with RT.

Outcome of HIV-infected patients with invasive squamous-cell carcinoma of the anal canal in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2004-08-01,"Before the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy for the treatment of HIV infection, HIV patients diagnosed with invasive squamous-cell carcinoma of the anal canal carried a very poor prognosis. This study was designed to determine the outcome in a similar group of patients in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. HIV-positive patients treated for invasive squamous-cell carcinoma of the anal canal at the University of Texas Medical Center affiliated hospitals from 1980 to 2001 were identified from operative data and cancer registries. We reviewed these records and collected data regarding age, CD4 count, highly active antiretroviral therapy, cancer treatment, complications, and survival. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of highly active antiretroviral therapy and compared using a Kaplan-Meier approach. Fourteen patients with HIV and invasive squamous-cell carcinoma of the anal canal were identified. Six were in the prehighly active antiretroviral therapy group and eight in the highly active antiretroviral therapy group. All were considered for treatment with chemotherapy and radiation. In the prehighly active antiretroviral therapy group, one patient refused therapy and three were unable to complete the squamous-cell carcinoma therapy as planned because of complications. Four of eight highly active antiretroviral therapy patients were unable to complete the squamous-cell carcinoma therapy as planned. The prehighly active antiretroviral therapy patients had a mean age of 40 years and a mean CD4 count of 190 at the time of diagnosis. The highly active antiretroviral therapy patients had a mean age of 44 years and a mean CD4 count of 255 at the time of diagnosis. The 24-month survival was 17 percent in the prehighly active antiretroviral therapy group and 67 percent in the highly active antiretroviral therapy group (P = 0.0524). All six patients in the prehighly active antiretroviral therapy group died with active squamous-cell carcinoma vs. two in the highly active antiretroviral therapy group. Four of the remaining six patients had no evidence of active squamous-cell carcinoma at the last follow-up visit. A review of patients with HIV and invasive squamous-cell carcinoma of the anal canal suggests a trend toward a higher CD4 count at the time of diagnosis and improved survival in patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. In this new era, HIV-positive patients should be on highly active antiretroviral therapy. If not, highly active antiretroviral therapy should be initiated, and standard multimodality therapies for invasive squamous-cell carcinoma of the anal canal are recommended.",Journal Article,5651.0,62.0,Before the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy for the treatment of HIV infection HIV patients diagnosed with invasive squamous-cell carcinoma of the canal carried a very poor prognosis This study was designed to determine the outcome in a similar group of patients in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy HIV-positive patients treated for invasive squamous-cell carcinoma of the canal at the University of Texas Medical Center affiliated hospitals from 1980 to 2001 were identified from operative data and cancer registries We reviewed these records and collected data regarding age CD4 count highly active antiretroviral therapy cancer treatment complications and survival The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of highly active antiretroviral therapy and compared using a Kaplan-Meier approach Fourteen patients with HIV and invasive squamous-cell carcinoma of the canal were identified Six were in the prehighly active antiretroviral therapy group and eight in the highly active antiretroviral therapy group All were considered for treatment with chemotherapy and radiation In the prehighly active antiretroviral therapy group one patient refused therapy and three were unable to complete the squamous-cell carcinoma therapy as planned because of complications Four of eight highly active antiretroviral therapy patients were unable to complete the squamous-cell carcinoma therapy as planned The prehighly active antiretroviral therapy patients had a mean age of 40 years and a mean CD4 count of 190 at the time of diagnosis The highly active antiretroviral therapy patients had a mean age of 44 years and a mean CD4 count of 255 at the time of diagnosis The 24-month survival was 17 percent in the prehighly active antiretroviral therapy group and 67 percent in the highly active antiretroviral therapy group P 0.0524 All six patients in the prehighly active antiretroviral therapy group died with active squamous-cell carcinoma vs. two in the highly active antiretroviral therapy group Four of the remaining six patients had no evidence of active squamous-cell carcinoma at the last follow-up visit A review of patients with HIV and invasive squamous-cell carcinoma of the canal suggests a trend toward a higher CD4 count at the time of diagnosis and improved survival in patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy In this new era HIV-positive patients should be on highly active antiretroviral therapy If not highly active antiretroviral therapy should be initiated and standard multimodality therapies for invasive squamous-cell carcinoma of the canal are recommended,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[348, 3, 193, 1, 561, 544, 6564, 36, 9, 3, 24, 1, 1942, 930, 1942, 7, 265, 5, 416, 691, 31, 134, 1, 3, 5614, 2629, 8, 923, 334, 356, 26, 45, 10, 1114, 6, 223, 3, 228, 4, 8, 288, 87, 1, 7, 4, 3, 1713, 1, 561, 544, 6564, 36, 1942, 109, 7, 73, 9, 416, 691, 31, 134, 1, 3, 5614, 28, 3, 1652, 1, 2738, 484, 574, 9048, 1987, 29, 4376, 6, 1758, 11, 108, 29, 1208, 74, 2, 12, 3768, 21, 446, 46, 1064, 2, 786, 74, 666, 89, 1440, 1276, 561, 544, 6564, 36, 12, 24, 521, 2, 25, 3, 7, 11, 2176, 237, 100, 271, 90, 23, 3, 463, 15, 1127, 1, 561, 544, 6564, 36, 2, 72, 75, 8, 876, 882, 353, 3225, 7, 5, 1942, 2, 416, 691, 31, 134, 1, 3, 5614, 11, 108, 437, 11, 4, 3, 30670, 544, 6564, 36, 87, 2, 659, 4, 3, 561, 544, 6564, 36, 87, 62, 11, 515, 9, 24, 5, 56, 2, 121, 4, 3, 30670, 544, 6564, 36, 87, 104, 69, 8237, 36, 2, 169, 11, 4253, 6, 236, 3, 691, 31, 134, 36, 22, 1465, 408, 1, 521, 294, 1, 659, 561, 544, 6564, 36, 7, 11, 4253, 6, 236, 3, 691, 31, 134, 36, 22, 1465, 3, 30670, 544, 6564, 36, 7, 42, 8, 313, 89, 1, 327, 60, 2, 8, 313, 1440, 1276, 1, 5974, 28, 3, 98, 1, 147, 3, 561, 544, 6564, 36, 7, 42, 8, 313, 89, 1, 584, 60, 2, 8, 313, 1440, 1276, 1, 7826, 28, 3, 98, 1, 147, 3, 259, 811, 25, 10, 269, 714, 4, 3, 30670, 544, 6564, 36, 87, 2, 598, 714, 4, 3, 561, 544, 6564, 36, 87, 19, 13, 54407, 62, 437, 7, 4, 3, 30670, 544, 6564, 36, 87, 1016, 5, 544, 691, 31, 134, 105, 100, 4, 3, 561, 544, 6564, 36, 87, 294, 1, 3, 1844, 437, 7, 42, 77, 241, 1, 544, 691, 31, 134, 28, 3, 1060, 166, 126, 2807, 8, 206, 1, 7, 5, 1942, 2, 416, 691, 31, 134, 1, 3, 5614, 844, 8, 853, 1317, 8, 142, 1440, 1276, 28, 3, 98, 1, 147, 2, 231, 25, 4, 7, 357, 561, 544, 6564, 36, 4, 26, 217, 1713, 1942, 109, 7, 257, 40, 23, 561, 544, 6564, 36, 492, 44, 561, 544, 6564, 36, 257, 40, 1917, 2, 260, 2425, 235, 9, 416, 691, 31, 134, 1, 3, 5614, 32, 793]",2651.0,15484343,1
Long-term results using local excision after preoperative chemoradiation among selected T3 rectal cancer patients.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2004-11-01,"To assess the pelvic failure among patients with T3 rectal cancer treated with local excision after preoperative chemoradiation. Between January 1990 and June 2002, 431 patients with clinically staged T3 rectal cancer were treated with preoperative chemoradiation followed by surgical resection. Full-thickness local excision [Kraske (n = 3) or a transanal excision (n = 23)] was performed in 26 patients because of patient refusal of abdominoperineal resection (APR) (n = 13), medical comorbidity (n = 4), physician preference after a complete clinical response (n = 6), and other reasons (n = 3). All patients were treated with continuous-infusion 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (300 mg/m(2) Monday to Friday) and concomitant pelvic radiation (45 Gy in 25 fractions with a 3-field belly board technique). Ten local-excision patients received a concomitant boost during the last week of therapy (1.5-Gy second daily fractions) for a total dose of 52.5 Gy. Similar preoperative treatment was followed by total mesorectal excision in 405 patients. Among the local-excision patients, the median tumor size was 3.5 cm (range, 0.5-7 cm). Well-differentiated or moderately-differentiated histology was present in all but 3 cases, and endoscopic ultrasound staging examination was performed in 25 of 26 patients. Based on CT findings, 1 patient was node positive. The median circumference involved by tumor was 33%, (20%-75%). The median distance from the anal verge was 3 cm (range, 1-8 cm). The mean follow-up was 46 months (range, 5-109 months) in the local-excision group. In the local-excision group, 19 of 26 patients had only residual scarring noted on digital rectal examination and rigid proctoscopy before surgery. Fourteen patients (54%) had a complete histologic response to chemoradiation, 9 patients (35%) had microscopic residual disease, and 3 patients (12%) had gross residual disease. Two intrapelvic recurrences occurred at 76 and 20 months among the 26 patients treated with local excision (6% 5-year actuarial pelvic recurrence rate). This rate compared with an 8% 5-year actuarial pelvic recurrence rate among T3 patients treated with mesorectal excision and a 6% pelvic recurrence rate in the subgroup of mesorectal-excision patients with a complete clinical response to preoperative chemoradiation. One additional local-excision patient recurred in an inguinal lymph node after local excision and subsequently died of metastatic disease. A total of 2 local-excision patients died of metastatic rectal cancer. Actuarial overall survival at 5 years was 86% in the local-excision group compared with 81% among mesorectal-excision patients (p = NS), and 85% in patients with a complete clinical response to chemoradiation followed by mesorectal excision by APR or LAR (p = NS). In an experience stimulated by patient refusal of APR, highly selected patients who responded well to conventional external-beam radiotherapy (CXRT) were selected to undergo local excision. Most of these patients had pathologic complete response. Local control and survival rates are comparable to those achieved with chemoradiation followed by mesorectal excision. This strategy should be prospectively studied in a group of patients with low rectal cancer who have no clinical evidence of tumor after chemoradiation.",Journal Article,5559.0,165.0,To assess the

"Familial polyposis coli: clinical manifestations, evaluation, management and treatment.","The Mount Sinai journal of medicine, New York",Mt. Sinai J. Med.,2004-11-01,"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant, hereditary colon cancer syndrome that is characterized by the presence of innumerable adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum. Gardner's syndrome is a variant of FAP, which in addition to the colonic polyps, also presents extracolonic manifestations, including desmoid tumors, osteomas, epidermoid cysts, various soft tissue tumors, and a predisposition to thyroid and periampullary cancers. Mutations of the APC gene are thought to be responsible for the development of FAP, and the location of the mutation on the gene is thought to influence the nature of the extracolonic manifestations that a given patient might develop. Though patients are often asymptomatic, bleeding, diarrhea, abdominal pain and mucous discharge frequently occur. Diagnostic tools include genetic testing, endoscopy, and monitoring for extra-intestinal manifestations. Currently, surgery is the only effective means of preventing progression to colorectal carcinoma. Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (RPC/IPAA) with mucosectomy is the preferred surgical procedure, since it attempts to eliminate all colorectal mucosa without the need for an ostomy.

Rectus flap reconstruction decreases perineal wound complications after pelvic chemoradiation and surgery: a cohort study.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2005-02-03,"A major source of morbidity after abdominoperineal resection (APR) after external beam pelvic radiation is perineal wound complications, seen in up to 66% of cases. Our purpose was to determine the effect of rectus abdominus myocutaneous (RAM) flap reconstruction on perineal wound morbidity in this population. The study group consisted of 19 patients with anorectal cancer treated with external beam pelvic radiation followed by APR and RAM flap reconstruction of the perineum. A prospectively collected database was queried to identify a control group (n = 59) with anorectal cancer treated with similar radiation doses that subsequently underwent an APR without a RAM flap during the same time period. Comparison of percentages was performed with a two-sided Fisher's exact test, and comparison of means was performed with Wilcoxon's test. Perineal wound complications occurred in 3 (15.8%) of the RAM flap patients and 26 (44.1%) of the control patients (P = .03). The incidence of other complications was not different between groups (42.1% vs. 42.4%; P = .8). Despite an increased number of anal squamous tumors, an increased vaginectomy rate, increased use of intraoperative radiotherapy, and an increased proportion of cases with recurrent disease, the flap group had a significantly lower rate of perineal wound complications relative to the control group. Perineal closure with a RAM flap significantly decreases the incidence of perineal wound complications in patients undergoing external beam pelvic radiation and APR for anorectal neoplasia.

Long-term oncologic outcome following preoperative combined modality therapy and total mesorectal excision of locally advanced rectal cancer.,Annals of surgery,Ann.

Locally advanced (T3-4 and/or N1) rectal adenocarcinoma is commonly treated with preoperative CMT and TME. However, the long-term oncologic results of this approach and factors predictive of a durable outcome remain largely unknown. Two hundred ninety-seven consecutive patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma at a median distance of 6 cm from the anal verge (range 0-15 cm) were treated with preoperative CMT (radiation: 5040 centi-Gray (cGy) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy) followed by TME from 1988 to 2002. A prospectively collected database was queried for long-term oncologic outcome and predictive clinicopathologic factors. With a median follow-up of 44 months, the estimated 10-year overall survival (OS) was 58% and 10 year recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 62%. On multivariate analysis, pathologic response >95%, lymphovascular invasion and/or perineural invasion (PNI), and positive lymph nodes were significantly associated with OS and RFS. Patients with a >95% pathologic response had a significantly improved OS (P = 0.003) and RFS (P = 0.002).

Organ sparing by conformal avoidance intensity-modulated radiation therapy for anal cancer: dosimetric evaluation of coverage of pelvis and inguinal/femoral nodes.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2005-09-01,"To describe a novel and straightforward conformal avoidance intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) technique for coverage of pelvis and inguinal/femoral nodes and to compare the dosimetry of the new method with that of other traditional methods of radiation treatment. Data of 2 patients with anal cancer were used as example cases to illustrate details and advantages of conformal avoidance IMRT technique. Conventional photons with enface electrons design was created first, thereby providing ""outermost boundaries"" defined as planning target volume (PTV) for subsequent conformal avoidance IMRT design. Organs at risk (OARs), including femoral head and neck and external genitalia, were contoured as conformal avoidance structures. A step-and-shoot inverse IMRT planning was subsequently generated. For dosimetric comparison, a recently published technique by modified segmental boost was also generated. These treatment techniques were evaluated by dose-volume histogram (DVH) of PTV and OARs. Dose profiles at four different depths from each treatment planning were generated for comparison. The DVH of PTV showed that coverage of the PTV was comparable among three treatment techniques. Percent volume of PTV receiving more than 90% prescription dose was in the range 94-98% for the three treatment techniques, and all had only 0-2% of PTV receiving more than 110% of prescription dose. The DVH of OARs confirmed that both femoral head and neck and external genitalia could be spared well by conformal avoidance IMRT as compared with the other two techniques. Although greater inhomogeneity of dose distribution within the PTV was noted by conformal avoidance IMRT technique, as shown by dose profiles at four different depths, the maximum doses at different depths were less than 115%, which was comparable to those planned by modified segmental boost technique.

Morbidity of rectosigmoid resection and primary anastomosis in patients undergoing primary cytoreductive surgery for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2005-09-08,"Studies from the colorectal literature have shown that factors associated with anastomotic leak after colorectal resection include long surgical time (>2 h), multiple blood transfusions, and short distance to the anal verge. The aim of this study was to assess the morbidity associated with en bloc resection of ovarian carcinoma with low anterior resection and anastomosis in patients undergoing primary cytoreductive surgery for advanced disease. We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients who had undergone primary cytoreduction for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer with rectosigmoid resection followed by low rectal anastomosis between January 1994 and June 2004. Patient characteristics, operative details, and postoperative complications were extracted from patients' charts. Seventy patients met the above criteria and form our study group. The median age was 59 years (range, 25-82). There were 52 stage IIIC (74%) and 18 stage IV (26%) cancers. The median operating time was 315 min (range, 120-750) and the median estimated blood loss was 1200 ml (range, 250-8000), with 53 (76%) patients requiring blood transfusion. Twenty-eight patients (40%) underwent major upper abdominal procedures other than omentectomy, and 14 patients (20%) underwent a second bowel resection. Twelve patients (17%) underwent a protective ileostomy while the remainder (83%) did not. Of the 58 patients with no ostomy, the only complications associated with the resection and anastomoses were a pelvic abscess in 3 patients (5%) and an anastomotic leak requiring diverting colostomy in 1 patient (1.7%). Of the 12 patients who had protective ileostomies, 3 (25%) had complications related to their ileostomy short-bowel syndrome requiring early reversal, incarceration of the prolapsed loop requiring surgical correction, and prolapse corrected electively at the time of second-look surgery. In women undergoing primary cytoreductive surgery, the morbidity associated with en bloc resection of ovarian carcinoma with low rectosigmoid resection and anastomosis without protective ileostomy was acceptably low, with an anastomotic leak rate of less than 2%.

T1 adenocarcinoma of the rectum: transanal excision or radical surgery?,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2005-10-01,"Recent studies suggest local excision may be acceptable treatment of T1 adenocarcinoma of the rectum, but there is little comparative data with radical surgery to assess outcomes and quantify risk. We performed a retrospective evaluation of patients with T1 rectal cancers treated by either transanal excision or radical resection at our institution to assess patient selection, cancer recurrence, and survival. All patients who underwent surgery for T1 adenocarcinomas of the rectum (0-15 cm from anal verge) by either transanal excision (TAE) or radical resection (RAD) between January 1987 and January 2004 were identified from a prospective database. Data were analyzed using Fisher exact test, Kaplan-Meier method, and log-rank test. Three hundred nineteen consecutive patients with T1 lesions were treated by transanal excision (n = 151) or radical surgery (n = 168) over the 17-year period. RAD surgery was associated with higher tumor location in the rectum, slightly larger tumor size, a similar rate of adverse histology, and a lymph node metastasis rate of 18%. Despite these features, patients who underwent RAD surgery had fewer local recurrences, fewer distant recurrences, and significantly better recurrence-free survival (P = 0.0001). Overall and disease-specific survival was similar for RAD and TAE groups. Despite a similar risk profile in the 2 surgical groups, patients with T1 rectal cancer treated by local excision were observed to have a 3- to 5-fold higher risk of tumor recurrence compared with patients treated by radical surgery. Local excision should be reserved for low-risk cancers in patients who will accept an increased risk of tumor recurrence, prolonged surveillance, and possible need for aggressive salvage surgery. Radical resection is the more definitive surgical treatment of T1 rectal cancers.",Comparative Study,5225.0,181.0,Recent studies suggest local excision may be acceptable treatment of T1 adenocarcinoma of the rectum but there is little comparative data with radical surgery to assess outcomes and quantify risk We performed a retrospective evaluation of patients with T1 cancers treated by either transanal excision or radical resection at our institution to assess patient selection cancer recurrence and survival All patients who underwent surgery for T1 adenocarcinomas of the rectum 0-15 cm from verge by either transanal excision TAE or radical resection RAD between January 1987 and January 2004 were identified from a prospective database Data were analyzed using Fisher exact test Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test Three hundred nineteen consecutive patients with T1 lesions were treated by transanal excision n 151 or radical surgery n 168 over the 17-year period RAD surgery was associated with higher tumor location in the rectum slightly larger tumor size a similar rate of adverse histology and a lymph node metastasis rate of 18 Despite these features patients who underwent RAD surgery had fewer local recurrences fewer distant recurrences and significantly better recurrence-free survival P 0.0001 Overall and disease-specific survival was similar for RAD and TAE groups Despite a similar risk profile in the 2 surgical groups patients with T1 cancer treated by local excision were observed to have a 3- to 5-fold higher risk of tumor recurrence compared with patients treated by radical surgery Local excision should be reserved for low-risk cancers in patients who will accept an increased risk of tumor recurrence prolonged surveillance and possible need for aggressive salvage surgery Radical resection is the more definitive surgical treatment of T1 cancers,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[435, 94, 309, 293, 1366, 68, 40, 1595, 24, 1, 1534, 449, 1, 3, 3660, 84, 125, 16, 1215, 2352, 74, 5, 711, 152, 6, 423, 123, 2, 3091, 43, 21, 173, 8, 459, 451, 1, 7, 5, 1534, 163, 73, 20, 361, 11825, 1366, 15, 711, 170, 28, 114, 731, 6, 423, 69, 881, 12, 146, 2, 25, 62, 7, 54, 208, 152, 9, 1534, 1586, 1, 3, 3660, 13, 167, 494, 29, 8330, 20, 361, 11825, 1366, 17330, 15, 711, 170, 11500, 59, 1024, 5450, 2, 1024, 1131, 11, 108, 29, 8, 482, 609, 74, 11, 311, 75, 3135, 2472, 412, 876, 882, 596, 2, 1066, 1026, 412, 169, 1128, 3498, 935, 7, 5, 1534, 406, 11, 73, 20, 11825, 1366, 78, 5075, 15, 711, 152, 78, 5359, 252, 3, 269, 111, 727, 11500, 152, 10, 41, 5, 142, 30, 1147, 4, 3, 3660, 3223, 1077, 30, 444, 8, 288, 116, 1, 290, 784, 2, 8, 263, 289, 278, 116, 1, 203, 550, 46, 404, 7, 54, 208, 11500, 152, 42, 1497, 293, 1593, 1497, 626, 1593, 2, 97, 380, 146, 115, 25, 19, 13, 488, 63, 2, 34, 112, 25, 10, 288, 9, 11500, 2, 17330, 271, 550, 8, 288, 43, 800, 4, 3, 18, 221, 271, 7, 5, 1534, 12, 73, 20, 293, 1366, 11, 164, 6, 47, 8, 27, 6, 33, 1116, 142, 43, 1, 30, 146, 72, 5, 7, 73, 20, 711, 152, 293, 1366, 257, 40, 6468, 9, 154, 43, 163, 4, 7, 54, 303, 11485, 35, 101, 43, 1, 30, 146, 1069, 617, 2, 899, 594, 9, 571, 992, 152, 711, 170, 16, 3, 80, 1057, 221, 24, 1, 1534, 163]",1767.0,16192807,101
A population-based analysis of temporal trends in the incidence of squamous anal canal cancer in relation to the HIV epidemic.,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999),J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr.,2005-12-01,"Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCA) is etiologically linked to human papillomavirus, and its incidence is increased among the immunosuppressed. We used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program to analyze the incidence of SCCA in relation to 3 separate periods during the HIV epidemic: the pre-HIV era (1973-1981), the HIV era (1982-1995), and the highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) era (1996-2001). The incidence per 100,000 population of SCCA increased from 0.6 in the pre-HIV era to 0.8 in the HIV era and to 1.0 in the HAART era. The gap in SCCA incidence between women and men decreased from a ratio of 1.6:1 in the pre-HIV era to 1.5:1 in the HIV era and to 1.2:1 in the HAART era.

However, the prognostic significance of pCR remains unclear. A prospectively collected database was queried to identify 200 patients with locally advanced disease treated from 1992 to 2002. The pCR group was defined as having no evidence of viable tumor on pathologic analysis. The no-downstaging group was defined as no difference between the pre-CMT ERUS stage and the pathologic stage.

Colon Rectum,2006-10-01,"This study was designed to describe perianal disease in a cohort of HIV-infected patients referred for high-resolution anoscopy. A retrospective chart review was performed on 52 HIV-infected patients referred for high-resolution anoscopy from 2001 to 2005. All patients underwent anal canal and perianal high-resolution anoscopy in the office with biopsy of suspicious areas. Patients with high-grade intraepithelial perianal lesions underwent multiple biopsies under general anesthesia in the operating room to rule out malignancy. Of the 52 patients, 19 (37 percent) had perianal abnormalities noted on high-resolution anoscopy and underwent punch biopsy. The mean duration of known HIV infection in these 19 patients (15 males) was 10.6 years, with 17 on highly active antiretroviral therapy for the last 3-month period. Mean CD4 count was 371 cells/microl. Office perianal biopsies diagnosed two patients with invasive squamous-cell carcinoma and nine with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Seven of the nine patients with perianal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion on office biopsy were submitted to multiple biopsies under general anesthesia. One of these seven had an occult perianal squamous-cell carcinoma. Perianal disease was common in this group of HIV-infected patients; 11 patients (21 percent of total) were diagnosed with squamous-cell carcinoma or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion.

We conducted a phase II study of capecitabine (825 mg/m2 orally, twice daily continuous) with radiotherapy (52.5 Gy/30 fractions to the primary tumor and perirectal nodes) in 54 patients with LARC (node-negative > or = T3 or any node-positive tumor) staged by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). The primary endpoint was pathologic response rate; secondary endpoints included toxicity profiles and survival parameters. Of the 54 patients (median age, 56.7 years; range, 21.3-78.7 years; male:female ratio, 1.7; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1: 100%), 51 patients (94%) had T3N0 or T3N1 disease by EUS. Surgery was not performed in 3 patients; 2 of these patients had metastatic disease, and the third patient refused after a complete clinical response. Of the 51 patients evaluable for pathologic response, 9 patients (18%) achieved complete response, and 12 patients (24%) had microscopic residual disease (< 10% viable cells). In addition, 26 patients of all 54 patients (51%) achieved T-downstaging, and 15 patients of 29 patients (52%) achieved N-downstaging. Grade 3/4 toxicities were radiation dermatitis (9%) and diarrhea (2%). Sphincter preservation rate for tumor < or = 5 cm from the anal verge was 67% (18/27).

Results of surgical salvage after failed chemoradiation therapy for epidermoid carcinoma of the anal canal.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2006-11-14,"The standard treatment for epidermoid carcinoma of the anal canal consists of combined radiation and chemotherapy. For patients who present with persistent or locally recurrent disease, salvage abdominoperineal resection is the treatment of choice. The purpose of this study is to review our experience with salvage surgery in this group of patients. From 1990-2002, 31 patients underwent radical salvage surgery with curative intent after failure of initial sphincter-conserving therapy, and the medical records of these patients were retrospectively reviewed. Clinicopathologic variables were determined and comparisons performed with the Cox proportional hazards model. Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Eleven patients underwent radical salvage surgery for persistent disease and 20 patients for recurrent disease. The median follow-up time was 29 months. The actuarial 5-year overall survival was 64%. Twelve patients developed recurrent disease after radical salvage surgery. Patients who received an initial radiation dose of less than 55 Gy had a significantly worse survival than those who received at least 55 Gy as part of their initial treatment (5-year overall survival 37.5% vs. 75%; age-adjusted hazard ratio 8.2 [95% CI: 1.1-59.8], P = .037). The presence of positive lymph nodes at presentation also adversely affected survival (P < .05).

A prospective pathologic analysis using whole-mount sections of rectal cancer following preoperative combined modality therapy: implications for sphincter preservation.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2007-01-01,"The aims of this study were to use a comprehensive whole-mount pathologic analysis to characterize microscopic patterns of residual disease, as well as circumferential and distal resection margins, in rectal cancer treated with preoperative CMT; and to identify clinicopathologic factors associated with residual disease. Recent studies have shown that preoperative combined modality therapy (CMT) for rectal cancer enhances rates of sphincter preservation. However, the efficacy of preoperative CMT in conjunction with a total mesorectal excision (TME)-based resection, in terms of resection margins using whole-mount sections, has not been reported. Furthermore, since patterns of residual disease and extent of distal spread following preoperative CMT are largely unknown, intraoperative determination of distal rectal transection remains a surgical challenge. We prospectively accrued 109 patients with endorectal ultrasound (ERUS)-staged, locally advanced rectal cancer (T2-T4 and/or N1), located a median distance of 7 cm from the anal verge, requiring preoperative CMT, and undergoing a TME-based resection. Comprehensive whole-mount pathologic analysis was performed, with particular emphasis on extent of residual disease, margin status, and intramural tumor extension. Clinicopathologic factors associated with residual disease were identified. A sphincter-preserving resection was feasible in 87 patients (80%), and in all 109 patients, distal margins were negative (median, 2.1 cm; range, 0.4-10 cm). Intramural extension beyond the gross mucosal edge of residual tumor was observed in only 2 patients (1.8%), both < or =0.95 cm. There were no positive circumferential margins (median, 10 mm; range, 1-28 mm), although 6 were less than or equal to 1 mm. On multivariate analysis, residual disease was observed more frequently in distally located tumors (distance from anal verge <5 cm) (P = 0.03).

Dosimetric study and in-vivo dose verification for conformal avoidance treatment of anal adenocarcinoma using helical tomotherapy.,Medical dosimetry : official journal of the American Association of Medical Dosimetrists,Med Dosim,2007-01-01,"This study evaluated the efficacy of using helical tomotherapy for conformal avoidance treatment of anal adenocarcinoma. We retrospectively generated step-and-shoot intensity-modulated radiotherapy (sIMRT) plans and helical tomotherapy plans for two anal cancer patients, one male and one female, who were treated by the sIMRT technique. Dose parameters for the planning target volume (PTV) and the organs-at-risk (OARs) were compared between the sIMRT and the helical tomotherapy plans. The helical tomotherapy plans showed better dose homogeneity in the PTV, better dose conformity around the PTV, and, therefore, better sparing of nearby OARs compared with the sIMRT plans.

L576P KIT mutation in anal melanomas correlates with KIT protein expression and is sensitive to specific kinase inhibition.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2007-07-01,"Activating mutations in either BRAF or NRAS are seen in a significant number of malignant melanomas, but their incidence appears to be dependent to ultraviolet light exposure. Thus, BRAF mutations have the highest incidence in non-chronic sun damaged (CSD), and are uncommon in acral, mucosal and CSD melanomas. More recently, activating KIT mutations have been described in rare cases of metastatic melanoma, without further reference to their clinical phenotypes. This finding is intriguing since KIT expression is downregulated in most melanomas progressing to more aggressive lesions. In this study, we investigated a group of anal melanomas for the presence of BRAF, NRAS, KIT and PDGFRA mutations. A heterozygous KIT exon 11 L576P substitution was identified in 3 of 20 cases tested. The 3 KIT mutation-carrying tumors were strongly immunopositive for KIT protein. No KIT mutations were identified in tumors with less than 4+ KIT immunostaining. NRAS mutation was identified in one tumor. No BRAF or PDGFRA mutations were identified in either KIT positive or negative anal melanomas. In vitro drug testing of stable transformant Ba/F3 KIT(L576P) mutant cells showed sensitivity for dasatinib (previously known as BMS-354825), a dual SRC/ABL kinase inhibitor, and imatinib. However, compared to an imatinib-sensitive KIT mutant, dasatinib was potent at lower doses than imatinib in the KIT(L576P) mutant. These results suggest that a subset of anal melanomas show activating KIT mutations, which are susceptible for therapy with specific kinase inhibitors.",Journal Article,4587.0,184.0,Activating mutations in either BRAF or NRAS are seen in a significant number of malignant melanomas but their incidence appears to be dependent to ultraviolet light exposure Thus BRAF mutations have the highest incidence in non-chronic sun damaged CSD and are uncommon in acral mucosal and CSD melanomas More recently activating KIT mutations have been described in rare cases of metastatic without further reference to their clinical phenotypes This finding is intriguing since KIT expression is downregulated in most melanomas progressing to more aggressive lesions In this study we investigated a group of melanomas for the presence of BRAF NRAS KIT and PDGFRA mutations A heterozygous KIT exon 11 L576P substitution was identified in 3 of 20 cases tested The 3 KIT mutation-carrying tumors were strongly immunopositive for KIT protein No KIT mutations were identified in tumors with less than 4+ KIT immunostaining NRAS mutation was identified in one tumor No BRAF or PDGFRA mutations were identified in either KIT positive or negative melanomas In vitro drug testing of stable transformant Ba/F3 KIT L576P mutant cells showed sensitivity for dasatinib previously known as BMS-354825 a dual SRC/ABL kinase inhibitor and imatinib However compared to an imatinib-sensitive KIT mutant dasatinib was potent at lower doses than imatinib in the KIT L576P mutant These results suggest that a subset of melanomas show activating KIT mutations which are susceptible for therapy with specific kinase inhibitors,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1616, 138, 4, 361, 566, 15, 2845, 32, 527, 4, 8, 93, 207, 1, 393, 1965, 84, 136, 287, 1233, 6, 40, 470, 6, 9224, 1691, 645, 631, 566, 138, 47, 3, 1076, 287, 4, 220, 442, 5479, 9884, 18386, 2, 32, 2052, 4, 7035, 3068, 2, 18386, 1965, 80, 761, 1616, 1164, 138, 47, 85, 1027, 4, 622, 140, 1, 113, 187, 195, 2482, 6, 136, 38, 2618, 26, 1567, 16, 9382, 1192, 1164, 55, 16, 3315, 4, 96, 1965, 4527, 6, 80, 571, 406, 4, 26, 45, 21, 565, 8, 87, 1, 1965, 9, 3, 463, 1, 566, 2845, 1164, 2, 4006, 138, 8, 4167, 1164, 1725, 175, 23589, 5029, 10, 108, 4, 27, 1, 179, 140, 650, 3, 27, 1164, 258, 2934, 57, 11, 1327, 28231, 9, 1164, 178, 77, 1164, 138, 11, 108, 4, 57, 5, 299, 76, 39, 1164, 5027, 2845, 258, 10, 108, 4, 104, 30, 77, 566, 15, 4006, 138, 11, 108, 4, 361, 1164, 109, 15, 199, 1965, 4, 439, 234, 471, 1, 585, 56135, 6669, 6904, 1164, 23589, 620, 37, 224, 485, 9, 1674, 373, 440, 22, 3502, 23350, 8, 1828, 2023, 1425, 216, 230, 2, 577, 137, 72, 6, 35, 577, 745, 1164, 620, 1674, 10, 1157, 28, 280, 415, 76, 577, 4, 3, 1164, 23589, 620, 46, 99, 309, 17, 8, 697, 1, 1965, 514, 1616, 1164, 138, 92, 32, 4012, 9, 36, 5, 112, 216, 222]",1504.0,17372901,16
Predictors and patterns of recurrence after definitive chemoradiation for anal cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol.

Between September 1992 and August 2004, 167 patients with nonmetastatic squamous cell anal carcinoma were treated with definitive chemoradiation. The median dose of radiotherapy was 5500 cGy. Concurrent chemotherapy was given with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin in 117 patients, 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C in 24 patients, and other regimens in 26 patients. The estimated 3-year rates of locoregional control, distant control, disease-free survival, and overall survival were 81%, 88%, 67%, and 84%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that higher T stage and N stage independently predicted for a higher rate of locoregional failure; higher N stage and basaloid subtype independently predicted for a higher rate of distant metastasis; and higher N stage and positive human immunodeficiency virus status independently predicted for a lower rate of overall survival. Among the patients who had locoregional failure, 18 (75%) had failure involving the anus or rectum, 5 (21%) had other pelvic recurrences, and 1 (4%) had inguinal recurrence. The 5 pelvic recurrences all occurred in patients with the superior border of the radiotherapy field at the bottom of the sacroiliac joint. Trials of more aggressive and innovative locoregional and systemic therapies are warranted in high-risk patients, based on their T and N stages. The majority of locoregional failures involve the anus and rectum, whereas inguinal recurrences occur rarely.

Predictors of tumor response and downstaging in patients who receive preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2007-05-01,"The objective of this study was to identify predictive factors for pathologic complete response and tumor downstaging after preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer. Between 1989 and 2004, 562 patients with nonmetastatic rectal adenocarcinoma received preoperative chemoradiation and underwent mesorectal excision. The median radiation dose was 45 Gray (Gy) (range, 19.8-58.6 Gy), 77% of patients received concurrent infusional 5-fluorouracil, 20% of patients received concurrent capecitabine, and 3% of patients received other regimens. Nineteen percent of patients achieved a pathologic complete response (CR), whereas 20% of patients had only microscopic residual disease at surgery, and 61% of patients had macroscopic residual disease at surgery. Downstaging of the tumor stage occurred in 57% of patients. The results from a univariate analysis indicated that tumor circumferential extent>60% (P=.033) and pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level>2.5 ng/mL (P=.015) were associated significantly with lower pathologic CR rates. The univariate analysis also indicated that tumor circumferential extent>60% (P=.001), pretreatment CEA level>2.5 ng/mL (P=.006), and distance from the anal verge>5 cm (P=.035) were associated significantly with lower downstaging rates. The results from a multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that greater circumferential extent of tumor (odds ratio [OR], 0.43; P=.033) independently predicted a lower pathologic CR rate. The multivariate logistic regression analysis also indicated that greater circumferential extent of tumor (OR, 0.49; P=.020) and greater distance from the anal verge (OR, 0.46; P=.010) independently predicted a lower downstaging rate. Circumferential extent of tumor, CEA level, and distance from the anal verge predicted for the pathologic response to preoperative chemoradiation for patients with rectal cancer.

Current treatment for localized anal carcinoma.,Current opinion in oncology,Curr Opin Oncol,2007-07-01,"Chemoradiation represents the standard of care for most patients with localized squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal. This article reviews randomized trials and recent studies on chemoradiation for anal cancer. A recent randomized trial showed that patients treated with induction 5-fluorouracil/cisplatin followed by concurrent 5-fluorouracil/cisplatin and radiotherapy had a higher colostomy rate than patients treated with concurrent 5-fluorouracil/mitomycin C and radiotherapy. It remains unclear whether this difference in the rate of colostomy was due to the chemotherapy agents, the use of induction therapy in the 5-fluorouracil/cisplatin arm, or other factors. Recent studies have started to evaluate intensity modulated radiation therapy for anal cancer, in an effort to reduce acute and long-term toxicity from radiotherapy. The role of cisplatin in anal cancer is not completely clear, although an ongoing randomized trial (Anal Cancer Trial II) may help clarify the role of cisplatin. Studies on tumor biology and patient genetics are warranted to identify patients that are most likely to benefit from newer locoregional and systemic therapies. Intensity modulated radiation therapy appears to be a promising approach for reducing treatment-related toxicity in anal cancer patients.

The current study evaluates the role of hepatic resection in patients with metastatic SCC to the liver. Between 1988 and 2006, 52 patients underwent hepatic resection of metastatic SCC at eight major cancer centers. Clinicopathologic factors were analyzed with regard to disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Primary SCC site was anal (n = 27), head/neck (n = 12), lung (n = 4), esophagus (n = 2), and other (n = 7). Treatment of primary SCC was chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy alone (n = 29), chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy + surgery (n = 15), or surgery alone (n = 8). Forty-seven patients underwent resection alone, 2 resection + radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and 3 RFA only. At last follow-up, 33 (63.5%) patients had recurred. The median time to recurrence was 9.8 months, and 5-year DFS was 18.6%. Factors associated with reduced DFS were liver tumor size > 5 cm (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.02) and positive surgical margin (HR = 2.33). The overall median survival after hepatic resection was 22.3 months and 5-year actuarial OS was 20.5%.

Using our prospective Colorectal Database, we identified patients diagnosed with rectal squamous-cell carcinoma at our institution between 1983 and 2005. Pathology was rereviewed, tumor immunophenotype was compared to control cases of anal squamous-cell carcinoma and rectal adenocarcinoma, treatment modalities and outcomes were analyzed. Twelve patients were identified (10 females median age, 58 years). Median distal extent of tumors was 7 (range, 5-8) cm from the anal verge. Treatment included chemotherapy only (n = 1), chemoradiation only (n = 2), induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation and surgery (n = 2), chemoradiation followed by surgery (n = 5), and surgery followed by chemoradiation (n = 2). The chemotherapy regimen was 5-fluorouracil-based. Radiotherapy total dose was 50.4 Gy (1.8 Gy/day, daily x 5) external iliac and inguinal nodes were not included in the radiation field. Complete clinical responders to chemoradiation (n = 2) received no further treatment. All seven partial responders underwent surgery; six had complete pathologic response; nodal status in two of six was unknown because they had local excision. Immunophenotypical analysis showed similar keratin expression profile between rectal squamous-cell carcinoma (n = 5) and rectal adenocarcinoma (n = 5), which is different from anal squamous-cell carcinoma (n = 10). All patients were alive without evidence of disease at follow-up (median follow-up, 2.6 (range, 0.5-16) years).

Concurrent chemotherapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy for anal canal cancer patients: a multicenter experience.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2007-10-01,"To report a multicenter experience treating anal canal cancer patients with concurrent chemotherapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). From October 2000 to June 2006, 53 patients were treated with concurrent chemotherapy and IMRT for anal squamous cell carcinoma at three tertiary-care academic medical centers. Sixty-two percent were T1-2, and 67% were N0; eight patients were HIV positive. Forty-eight patients received fluorouracil (FU)/mitomycin, one received FU/cisplatin, and four received FU alone. All patients underwent computed tomography-based treatment planning with pelvic regions and inguinal nodes receiving a median of 45 Gy. Primary sites and involved nodes were boosted to a median dose of 51.5 Gy. All acute toxicity was scored according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. All late toxicity was scored using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. Median follow-up was 14.5 months (range, 5.2 to 102.8 months). Acute grade 3+ toxicity included 15.1% GI and 37.7% dermatologic toxicity; all acute grade 4 toxicities were hematologic; and acute grade 4 leukopenia and neutropenia occurred in 30.2% and 34.0% of patients, respectively. Treatment breaks occurred in 41.5% of patients, lasting a median of 4 days. Forty-nine patients (92.5%) had a complete response, one patient had a partial response, and three had stable disease. All HIV-positive patients achieved a complete response. Eighteen-month colostomy-free survival, overall survival, freedom from local failure, and freedom from distant failure were 83.7%, 93.4%, 83.9%, and 92.9%, respectively.

Association between bone marrow dosimetric parameters and acute hematologic toxicity in anal cancer patients treated with concurrent chemotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2007-11-08,"To test the hypothesis that the volume of pelvic bone marrow (PBM) receiving 10 and 20 Gy or more (PBM-V(10) and PBM-V(20)) is associated with acute hematologic toxicity (HT) in anal cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. We analyzed 48 consecutive anal cancer patients treated with concurrent chemotherapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy. The median radiation dose to gross tumor and regional lymph nodes was 50.4 and 45 Gy, respectively. Pelvic bone marrow was defined as the region extending from the iliac crests to the ischial tuberosities, including the os coxae, lumbosacral spine, and proximal femora. Endpoints included the white blood cell count (WBC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), hemoglobin, and platelet count nadirs. Regression models with multiple independent predictors were used to test associations between dosimetric parameters and HT. Twenty patients (42%) had Stage T3-4 disease; 15 patients (31%) were node positive. Overall, 27 (56%), 24 (50%), 4 (8%), and 13 (27%) experienced acute Grade 3-4 leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, respectively. On multiple regression analysis, increased PBM-V(5), V(10), V(15), and V(20) were significantly associated with decreased WBC and ANC nadirs, as were female gender, decreased body mass index, and increased lumbosacral bone marrow V(10), V(15), and V(20) (p < 0.05 for each association). Lymph node positivity was significantly associated with a decreased WBC nadir on multiple regression analysis (p < 0.05). This analysis supports the hypothesis that increased low-dose radiation to PBM is associated with acute HT during chemoradiotherapy for anal cancer.

Squamous-cell carcinoma of the anal canal: predictors of treatment outcome.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2008-01-08,"The incidence of anal canal squamous-cell carcinoma is increasing. Limited data exist on predictors of treatment failure. This study was designed to identify predictors for relapse/persistence after first-line therapy. Using one database, we identified 131 Stages I-III patients treated for primary anal canal squamous-cell carcinoma at our institution from December 1986 to August 2006, with minimum six-month follow-up. Demographic, pathologic, treatment, and outcome data were extracted. Treatment failure was defined as biopsy-proven persistence or relapse (local and/or distant). Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate survival analyses were performed. Of 131 patients (median age, 58.3 years; median follow-up, 2.9 (range, 0.6-11.2) years), 66 percent were females, 43.5 percent were Stage II, and 11 (8 percent) were HIV-positive. Surgery only (local excision) was uncommon (6.9 percent, n=9). One hundred twenty-two patients (93.1 percent) received radiotherapy; two required preradiotherapy diversion. Although 114 (93.4 percent) completed radiotherapy, most required treatment breaks, making total duration of radiotherapy longer than planned. Almost all patients undergoing radiotherapy (96.7 percent, 118/122) also had chemotherapy: 118 (100 percent, Stages I-III) had concurrent chemotherapy: (98 (83.8 percent) mitomycin/5-fluorouracil, 12 (10.2 percent) cisplatin/5-fluorouracil, 8 (6.8 percent) 5-fluorouracil alone); 35 of 46 (76 percent) Stage III patients received induction chemotherapy (34 (97.1 percent) cisplatin/5-fluorouracil, 1 (2.8 percent) 5-fluorouracil alone). Many (44 percent Stages I/II, 48.9 percent Stage III) required dose adjustments. Thirty-seven patients (28.2 percent) failed first-line therapy. There were no differences between patients with relapse (n=22) or persistence (n=15) of disease. Bivariate analyses demonstrated that T stage (P=0.0019), completion of radiotherapy, and total radiotherapy dose (P=0.03) were all significantly associated with treatment failure.

cT3N0 rectal cancer: potential overtreatment with preoperative chemoradiotherapy is warranted.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2008-01-01,"Although combined-modality therapy (CMT) is the preferred treatment for T3 and/or lymph node (LN)-positive rectal cancer, the German rectal cancer study published in 2004 demonstrated that 18% of patients deemed suitable for preoperative CMT by endorectal ultrasound (ERUS) may be overstaged. Because data also suggest that LN-negative rectal cancer after total mesorectal excision may not require radiotherapy, it is reasonable to consider omitting radiotherapy for the cT3N0 subset. We therefore determined the accuracy of pre-CMT ERUS or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) staging, to explore the validity of a nonpreoperative CMT approach for cT3N0 disease. One hundred eighty-eight ERUS-/MRI-staged T3N0 rectal cancer patients received preoperative CMT (fluorouracil based and 45-50.4 Gy) followed by radical resection. Rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) and mesorectal LN involvement were determined. Tumors were located a median of 5 cm from the anal verge. Sphincter-preserving surgery was performed in 143 patients (76%). Overall pCR was 20%, and 41 patients (22%) had pathologically positive mesorectal LNs. The incidence of positive LNs significantly increased with T stage: ypT0, 3%; ypT1, 7%; ypT2, 20%; ypT3-4, 36% (P = .001). The accuracy of preoperative ERUS/MRI for staging mid to distal cT3N0 rectal cancer is limited because 22% of patients have undetected mesorectal LN involvement despite CMT. Therefore, ERUS-/MRI-staged T3N0 rectal cancer patients should continue to receive preoperative CMT. Although 18% may be overstaged and therefore overtreated, our data suggest that an even larger number would be understaged and require postoperative CMT, which is associated with significantly inferior local control, higher toxicity, and worse functional outcome.",Journal Article,4403.0,173.0,Although combined-modality therapy CMT is the preferred treatment for T3 and/or lymph node LN -positive cancer the German cancer study published in 2004 demonstrated that 18 of patients deemed suitable for preoperative CMT by endorectal ultrasound ERUS may be overstaged Because data also suggest that LN-negative cancer after total mesorectal excision may not require radiotherapy it is reasonable to consider omitting radiotherapy for the cT3N0 subset We therefore determined the accuracy of pre-CMT ERUS or magnetic resonance imaging MRI staging to explore the validity of a nonpreoperative CMT approach for cT3N0 disease One hundred eighty-eight ERUS-/MRI-staged T3N0 cancer patients received preoperative CMT fluorouracil based and 45-50.4 Gy followed by radical resection Rates of pathologic complete response pCR and mesorectal LN involvement were determined Tumors were located a median of 5 cm from the verge Sphincter-preserving surgery was performed in 143 patients 76 Overall pCR was 20 and 41 patients 22 had pathologically positive mesorectal LNs The incidence of positive LNs significantly increased with T stage ypT0 3 ypT1 7 ypT2 20 ypT3-4 36 P .001 The accuracy of preoperative ERUS/MRI for staging mid to distal cT3N0 cancer is limited because 22 of patients have undetected mesorectal LN involvement despite CMT Therefore ERUS-/MRI-staged T3N0 cancer patients should continue to receive preoperative CMT Although 18 may be overstaged and therefore overtreated our data suggest that an even larger number would be understaged and require postoperative CMT which is associated with significantly inferior local control higher toxicity and worse functional outcome,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[242, 397, 1396, 36, 5380, 16, 3, 2514, 24, 9, 2065, 2, 15, 263, 289, 1763, 109, 12, 3, 10842, 12, 45, 983, 4, 1131, 264, 17, 203, 1, 7, 3779, 2884, 9, 498, 5380, 20, 5615, 1945, 16345, 68, 40, 28668, 408, 74, 120, 309, 17, 1763, 199, 12, 50, 181, 5823, 1366, 68, 44, 1353, 310, 192, 16, 3203, 6, 2419, 12367, 310, 9, 3, 21494, 697, 21, 673, 509, 3, 1190, 1, 671, 5380, 16345, 15, 1484, 1535, 270, 704, 632, 6, 1645, 3, 3099, 1, 8, 56813, 5380, 353, 9, 21494, 34, 104, 1128, 2207, 659, 16345, 704, 2930, 10816, 12, 7, 103, 498, 5380, 1404, 90, 2, 512, 212, 39, 381, 370, 20, 711, 170, 151, 1, 510, 236, 51, 604, 2, 5823, 1763, 799, 11, 509, 57, 11, 2308, 8, 52, 1, 33, 494, 29, 3, 8330, 5400, 4972, 152, 10, 173, 4, 4400, 7, 846, 63, 604, 10, 179, 2, 605, 7, 350, 42, 2998, 109, 5823, 2704, 3, 287, 1, 109, 2704, 97, 101, 5, 102, 82, 9607, 27, 22463, 67, 28755, 179, 16915, 39, 511, 19, 144, 3, 1190, 1, 498, 16345, 704, 9, 632, 4863, 6, 2107, 21494, 12, 16, 383, 408, 350, 1, 7, 47, 11449, 5823, 1763, 799, 550, 5380, 673, 16345, 704, 2930, 10816, 12, 7, 257, 1906, 6, 560, 498, 5380, 242, 203, 68, 40, 28668, 2, 673, 18460, 114, 74, 309, 17, 35, 871, 1077, 207, 688, 40, 21133, 2, 1353, 573, 5380, 92, 16, 41, 5, 97, 1663, 293, 182, 142, 155, 2, 639, 583, 228]",1681.0,18202411,72

Guided primarily by the World Health Organization/International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer criteria for pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors, we were able to classify 87 high-grade GI tract tumors that initially carried a diagnosis of either poorly differentiated carcinoma with or without any neuroendocrine characteristics, small cell carcinoma, or combined adenocarcinoma-neuroendocrine carcinoma into the following 4 categories. The first was small cell carcinoma (n=23), which had features typical of pulmonary small cell carcinoma, although the cells tended to have a more round nuclear contour. The second was large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (n=31), which had a morphology similar to its pulmonary counterpart and showed positive immunoreactivity for either chromogranin (71%) or synaptophysin (94%) or both. The third was mixed neuroendocrine carcinoma (n=11), which had intermediate histologic features (eg, cells with an increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio but with apparent nucleoli), and positive immunoreactivity for at least 1 neuroendocrine marker. The fourth was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (n=17). In addition, 5 of the 87 tumors showed either nonsmall cell type neuroendocrine morphology (n=3) or immunohistochemical reactivity for neuroendocrine markers (n=2), but not both. Further analysis showed that most HGNECs arising in the squamous lined parts (esophagus and anal canal) were small cell type (78%), whereas most involving the glandular mucosa were large cell (53%) or mixed (82%) type; associated adenocarcinomas were more frequent in large cell (61%) or mixed (36%) type than in small cell type (26%); and focal intracytoplasmic mucin was seen only in large cell or mixed type. As a group, the 2-year disease-specific survival for patients with HGNEC was 25.4% (median follow-up time, 11.3 mo). No significant survival difference was observed among the different histologic subtypes. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the existence of both small cell and nonsmall cell types of HGNEC in the GI tract, and provides a detailed illustration of their morphologic spectrum. There are differences in certain pathologic features between small cell and nonsmall cell types, whereas the differences between the subtypes of nonsmall cell category (large cell versus mixed) are less distinct. Given the current uncertainty as to whether large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma is as chemosensitive as small cell carcinoma even in the lung, our data provide further evidence in favor of a dichotomous classification scheme (small cell vs. nonsmall cell) for HGNEC of the GI tract. Separation of nonsmall cell type into large cell and mixed subtypes may not be necessary. These tumors are clinically aggressive. Prospective studies using defined diagnostic criteria are needed to determine their biologic characteristics and optimal management.",Journal Article,4282.0,117.0,Although small cell carcinoma of the

"Fluorouracil, mitomycin, and radiotherapy vs fluorouracil, cisplatin, and radiotherapy for carcinoma of the anal canal: a randomized controlled trial.",JAMA,JAMA,2008-04-01,"Chemoradiation as definitive therapy is the preferred primary therapy for patients with anal canal carcinoma; however, the 5-year disease-free survival rate from concurrent fluorouracil/mitomycin and radiation is only approximately 65%. To compare the efficacy of cisplatin-based (experimental) therapy vs mitomycin-based (standard) therapy in treatment of anal canal carcinoma. US Gastrointestinal Intergroup trial RTOG 98-11, a multicenter, phase 3, randomized controlled trial comparing treatment with fluorouracil plus mitomycin and radiotherapy vs treatment with fluorouracil plus cisplatin and radiotherapy in 682 patients with anal canal carcinoma enrolled between October 31, 1998, and June 27, 2005. Stratifications included sex, clinical nodal status, and tumor diameter. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 intervention groups: (1) the mitomycin-based group (n = 341), who received fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 on days 1-4 and 29-32) plus mitomycin (10 mg/m2 on days 1 and 29) and radiotherapy (45-59 Gy) or (2) the cisplatin-based group (n = 341), who received fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 on days 1-4, 29-32, 57-60, and 85-88) plus cisplatin (75 mg/m2 on days 1, 29, 57, and 85) and radiotherapy (45-59 Gy; start day = day 57). The primary end point was 5-year disease-free survival; secondary end points were overall survival and time to relapse. A total of 644 patients were assessable. The median follow-up for all patients was 2.51 years. Median age was 55 years, 69% were women, 27% had a tumor diameter greater than 5 cm, and 26% had clinically positive nodes. The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 60% (95% confidence interval [CI], 53%-67%) in the mitomycin-based group and 54% (95% CI, 46%-60%) in the cisplatin-based group (P = .17). The 5-year overall survival rate was 75% (95% CI, 67%-81%) in the mitomycin-based group and 70% (95% CI, 63%-76%) in the cisplatin-based group (P = .10). The 5-year local-regional recurrence and distant metastasis rates were 25% (95% CI, 20%-30%) and 15% (95% CI, 10%-20%), respectively, for mitomycin-based treatment and 33% (95% CI, 27%-40%) and 19% (95% CI, 14%-24%), respectively, for cisplatin-based treatment. The cumulative rate of colostomy was significantly better for mitomycin-based than cisplatin-based treatment (10% vs 19%; P = .02). Severe hematologic toxicity was worse with mitomycin-based treatment (P < .001). In this population of patients with anal canal carcinoma, cisplatin-based therapy failed to improve disease-free-survival compared with mitomycin-based therapy, but cisplatin-based therapy resulted in a significantly worse colostomy rate. These findings do not support the use of cisplatin in place of mitomycin in combination with fluorouracil and radiotherapy in the treatment of anal canal carcinoma. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier:

The spectrum and clinical sequelae of human papillomavirus infection.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2007-11-01,"Infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted disease afflicting approximately 80% of the population. HPV infection is an essential factor in cervical carcinogenesis and cervical carcinoma is the second most common cause of cancer among women worldwide. In addition to cervical cancer, other malignancies in both men and women such as esophageal, oropharyngeal, and anal cancer have been causally associated with this virus.

Consenting operable patients with stage II or III adenocarcinoma of the rectum received capecitabine (825 mg/m2 PO BID, 5 days/wk x 5 weeks) and SIB-IMRT delivering 55 Gy (2.2 Gy/fraction) to the gross tumor while simultaneously delivering 45 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction) to the regional lymph nodes and areas at risk for harboring microscopic disease. Total mesorectal excision followed 6 weeks later. A single pathologist analyzed the resected tumor's TNM stage and Mandard regression/response scores. The primary end point was pathologic complete response (pCR) rate. Ten subjects were enrolled, 2 of which were ineligible (1 screening failure and 1 unrelated cerebrovascular accident occurring early in treatment). The remaining 8 patients were evaluable. All 8 completed chemoradiation with strict compliance to the protocol schedule and then went on to surgical resection. At a median follow-up of 26 months (range, 15-40), all patients were alive without evidence of recurrent disease. The crude pCR rate was 38% with 50% achieving down-staging. Of 3 patients who had tumors within 5 cm of the anal verge, 2 underwent sphincter-sparing procedures. Grade 4 diarrhea occurred in 1 of 8 (13%) patients. The remaining toxicities were grade 1 or 2.

Multimodality therapy in penile cancer: when and which treatments?,World journal of urology,World J Urol,2008-08-06,"Metastatic penile cancer typically comes to attention while the clinical extent of disease is limited to the inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes. Primary surgical management of lymph node metastases achieves tumor control and long-term survival for only a small percentage of these patients. To determine the optimal use of multimodality treatment in locally advanced penile cancer, we conducted a literature review. Relevant English-language literature was identified with the use of Medline; additional cited works not detected on the initial search were also reviewed. There is an emerging strategy of preoperative (neoadjuvant) combination chemotherapy to improve the progression-free survival of penile cancer patients with bulky regional lymph node metastases. Radiotherapy for inguinal metastases and postoperative (adjuvant) radiation for selected patients has also been effective in this setting. In patients with lymph node metastases, the benefit of ilioinguinal lymphadenectomy may be extended by the addition of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

US intergroup anal carcinoma trial: tumor diameter predicts for colostomy.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-01-12,"The US Gastrointestinal Intergroup Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 98-11 anal carcinoma trial showed that cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy resulted in a significantly higher rate of colostomy compared with mitomycin-based therapy. Established prognostic variables for patients with anal carcinoma include tumor diameter, clinical nodal status, and sex, but pretreatment variables that would predict the likelihood of colostomy are unknown. A secondary analysis was performed by combining patients in the two treatment arms to evaluate whether new predictive and prognostic variables would emerge. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to correlate overall survival (OS), disease-free survival, and time to colostomy (TTC) with pretreatment and treatment variables. Of 682 patients enrolled, 644 patients were assessable and analyzed. In the multivariate analysis, tumor-related prognosticators for poorer OS included node-positive cancer (P < or = .0001), large (> 5 cm) tumor diameter (P = .01), and male sex (P = .016). In the treatment-related categories, cisplatin-based therapy was statistically significantly associated with a higher rate of colostomy (P = .03) than was mitomycin-based therapy. In the pretreatment variables category, only large tumor diameter independently predicted for TTC (P = .008).

Sphincter preservation in low rectal cancer is facilitated by preoperative chemoradiation and intersphincteric dissection.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2009-02-01,"The aim of this study was to evaluate oncologic outcome in patients with locally advanced distal rectal cancer treated with preoperative chemoradiation followed by low anterior resection (LAR)/stapled coloanal anastomosis, LAR/intersphincteric dissection/hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis, or abdominoperineal resection (APR). Distal rectal cancer presents a surgical challenge, and the goals of treatment often include tumor eradication without sacrifice of the anal sphincters. The technique of intersphincteric resection removes the internal anal sphincter to gain additional distal rectal margin in hopes of avoiding a permanent stoma. We analyzed 148 patients with stage II and III rectal cancers (endorectal ultrasound staged uT3-4 and/or uN1) located < or =6 cm from the anal verge, treated by preoperative chemoradiation and total mesorectal excision from 1998 to 2004. Eighty-five patients (57%) had sphincter-preserving resection (41, LAR/stapled coloanal anastomosis; 44, LAR/intersphincteric resection/hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis); 63 patients had APR. Patients undergoing APR were older, with more poorly differentiated tumors evidencing less response to chemoradiation and more likely to require extended resection. Complete resection with negative histologic margins was achieved in 92%; circumferential margins were positive in 2 (5%) of 44 in the intersphincteric resection group and 8 (13%) of 63 in the APR group. Distal margins were positive in 2 (5%) of 44 in the intersphincteric resection group. With median follow-up of 47 months, there were a total of 7 local recurrences (5%): 1, 0, and 6 in the stapled anastomosis, intersphincteric resection, and APR groups, respectively. Estimated 5-year recurrence-free survival for the stapled anastomosis, intersphincteric resection, and APR groups were 85%, 83%, and 47% respectively (P = 0.001). In low rectal cancer, sphincter preservation is facilitated by a significant response to preoperative chemoradiation and intersphincteric resection, without compromise of margins or outcome. In those who have a less favorable response, abdominoperineal resection is more likely to be required and is associated with poorer outcome.",Journal Article,4006.0,146.0,The aim of this study was to evaluate oncologic outcome in patients with locally advanced distal cancer treated with preoperative chemoradiation followed by low anterior resection LAR /stapled coloanal anastomosis LAR/intersphincteric dissection/hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis or abdominoperineal resection APR Distal cancer presents a surgical challenge and the goals of treatment often include tumor eradication without sacrifice of the sphincters The technique of intersphincteric resection removes the internal sphincter to gain additional distal margin in hopes of avoiding a permanent stoma We analyzed 148 patients with stage II and III cancers endorectal ultrasound staged uT3-4 and/or uN1 located or =6 cm from the verge treated by preoperative chemoradiation and total mesorectal excision from 1998 to 2004 Eighty-five patients 57 had sphincter-preserving resection 41 LAR/stapled coloanal anastomosis 44 LAR/intersphincteric resection/hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis 63 patients had APR Patients undergoing APR were older with more poorly differentiated tumors evidencing less response to chemoradiation and more likely to require extended resection Complete resection with negative histologic margins was achieved in 92 circumferential margins were positive in 2 5 of 44 in the intersphincteric resection group and 8 13 of 63 in the APR group Distal margins were positive in 2 5 of 44 in the intersphincteric resection group With median follow-up of 47 months there were a total of 7 local recurrences 5 1 0 and 6 in the stapled anastomosis intersphincteric resection and APR groups respectively Estimated 5-year recurrence-free survival for the stapled anastomosis intersphincteric resection and APR groups were 85 83 and 47 respectively P 0.001 In low cancer sphincter preservation is facilitated by a significant response to preoperative chemoradiation and intersphincteric resection without compromise of margins or outcome In those who have a less favorable response abdominoperineal resection is more likely to be required and is associated with poorer outcome,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[3, 1130, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 376, 1998, 228, 4, 7, 5, 795, 131, 2107, 12, 73, 5, 498, 975, 370, 20, 154, 2882, 170, 5270, 9911, 17215, 5519, 5270, 25148, 1161, 2833, 19111, 17215, 5519, 15, 8177, 170, 7012, 2107, 12, 2740, 8, 221, 1745, 2, 3, 2802, 1, 24, 629, 643, 30, 5173, 187, 16670, 1, 3, 34633, 3, 1312, 1, 25148, 170, 17699, 3, 2329, 5400, 6, 1803, 402, 2107, 959, 4, 10442, 1, 6048, 8, 4377, 9585, 21, 311, 4647, 7, 5, 82, 215, 2, 316, 163, 5615, 1945, 2930, 31253, 39, 2, 15, 38918, 2308, 15, 49, 494, 29, 3, 8330, 73, 20, 498, 975, 2, 181, 5823, 1366, 29, 1850, 6, 1131, 2207, 365, 7, 696, 42, 5400, 4972, 170, 605, 5270, 9911, 17215, 5519, 584, 5270, 25148, 170, 2833, 19111, 17215, 5519, 676, 7, 42, 7012, 7, 479, 7012, 11, 434, 5, 80, 1240, 1442, 57, 57675, 299, 51, 6, 975, 2, 80, 322, 6, 1353, 1747, 170, 236, 170, 5, 199, 884, 1012, 10, 513, 4, 937, 7937, 1012, 11, 109, 4, 18, 33, 1, 584, 4, 3, 25148, 170, 87, 2, 66, 233, 1, 676, 4, 3, 7012, 87, 2107, 1012, 11, 109, 4, 18, 33, 1, 584, 4, 3, 25148, 170, 87, 5, 52, 166, 126, 1, 662, 53, 125, 11, 8, 181, 1, 67, 293, 1593, 33, 14, 13, 2, 49, 4, 3, 9911, 5519, 25148, 170, 2, 7012, 271, 106, 661, 33, 111, 146, 115, 25, 9, 3, 9911, 5519, 25148, 170, 2, 7012, 271, 11, 772, 852, 2, 662, 106, 19, 13, 144, 4, 154, 12, 5400, 2224, 16, 4667, 20, 8, 93, 51, 6, 498, 975, 2, 25148, 170, 187, 4665, 1, 1012, 15, 228, 4, 135, 54, 47, 8, 299, 913, 51, 8177, 170, 16, 80, 322, 6, 40, 616, 2, 16, 41, 5, 1769, 228]",2077.0,19212176,136
Intensity-modulated radiation therapy for the treatment of squamous cell anal cancer with para-aortic nodal involvement.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J.

Between 2001 and 2007, 6 patients with squamous cell anal cancer and para-aortic nodal involvement were treated with IMRT and concurrent infusional 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin. The primary tumor was treated with a median dose of 57.5 Gy (range, 54-60 Gy), involved para-aortic, pelvic, and inguinal lymph nodes were treated with a median dose of 55 Gy (range, 50.5-55 Gy), and noninvolved nodal regions were treated with a median dose of 45 Gy (range, 43.5-45 Gy). After a median follow-up of 25 months, none of the patients had a recurrence at the primary tumor, pelvic/inguinal nodes, or para-aortic nodes, whereas 2 patients developed distant metastases to the liver. Four of the 6 patients are alive. The 3-year actuarial locoregional control, distant control, and overall survival rates were 100%, 56%, and 63%, respectively. Four of the 6 patients developed Grade 3 acute gastrointestinal toxicity during chemoradiation. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy could potentially serve as definitive therapy in anal cancer patients with para-aortic nodal involvement.

Abdominal perineal resection improves survival for nonmetastatic adenocarcinoma of the anal canal.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2009-02-25,"There remains a lack of consensus regarding the optimal treatment for patients with curable adenocarcinoma of the anal canal (AAC). We sought to determine the role of definitive surgical resection and radiation in a large cohort of patients with AAC. We queried the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry to identify all patients with nonmetastatic AAC from 1988 to 2004 and analyzed clinical factors, treatment modalities, and overall survival in this cohort. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed to compare 5-year overall survival based on treatment groups: abdominal perineal resection (APR) only, APR and external beam radiation (APR and EBR), and EBR only. We performed a Cox regression analysis to determine factors predictive of outcome. A total of 165 patients were identified with nonmetastatic AAC. Of these, 30 patients were treated with an APR only, 42 patients with an APR and EBR, and 93 patients with EBR only. The 5-year survival for APR only, APR and EBR, and EBR only was 58%, 50%, and 30%, respectively. The difference in survival was statistically significant (APR vs. EBR, P = .02; APR and EBR vs. EBR, P = 0.04).

The study included 47,308 men 20 years and older with an index oral cavity/pharyngeal or anogenital cancer. Second primary HPV-associated cancers (anogenital or oral cavity/pharyngeal) or HPV-unrelated cancers (prostate, bladder, or colon).

Molecular biomarkers correlate with disease-free survival in patients with anal canal carcinoma treated with chemoradiation.,Digestive diseases and sciences,Dig. Dis. Sci.,2009-04-28,"Large primary tumor and clinical nodal involvement in patients with anal carcinoma treated with chemoradiation are associated with poor disease-free survival (DFS). However, the outcome in individual patient is unpredictable. We hypothesized that biomarkers related to chemotherapy and/or radiation resistance would be associated with DFS. We analyzed clinical and biomarker data in 30 patients with anal carcinoma who had chemoradiation. Patient selection was based on the availability of untreated cancer for biomarkers, completion of prescribed chemoradiation, and patient outcomes (~50% disease-free) nonrepresentative of published cohorts but conducive to biomarker discovery. Ten biomarkers, Ki67, human telomerase (hTERT), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), p53, p16, Bcl-2, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB), SHH, and Gli-1, were studied. Raw data as continuous variable (only EGFR was trichotomized) were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate Cox models were utilized to assess relationship between DFS and biomarkers. Twenty-three of 30 patients were women, tumor diameter was >5 cm in 30, and 37% had clinically positive nodes. Fourteen (30%) patients had a DFS event after chemoradiation. In univariate analysis, NF-kappaB (P = 0.01), SHH (P = 0.02), Gli-1 (P = 0.02), and tumor diameter (P = 0.03) were significantly associated with DFS, and Ki67 (P = 0.07) was marginally significant. In multivariate analysis, tumor diameter (P = 0.003), Ki67 (P = 0.005), NF-kappaB (P = 0.002), SHH (P = 0.02), and Gli-1 (P = 0.02) were significantly associated with DFS. Our data, albeit preliminary, suggest that several biomarkers (Ki67, NF-kappaB, SHH, and Gli-1) are associated with DFS.

Long-term survival after transanal excision of T1 rectal cancer.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2009-04-01,"Several series report higher recurrence after transanal excision of T1 rectal cancer than after radical resection. However, the impact of transanal excision on cancer mortality has not been adequately studied. The purpose of this study was to compare oncologic outcomes of transanal excision with those of radical resection. Patients with transanal excision or radical resection for T1 rectal cancer treated between 1985 and 2004 were identified from a prospective database. Patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy or radiation or with tumors >12 cm from the anal verge were excluded. The final cohort comprised 145 radical resections and 137 transanal excisions. The transanal excision group was notable for older mean age (64 vs. 59 years), shorter mean distance from anal verge (5.9 vs. 7.8 cm), and smaller tumor size (2.3 vs. 3.1 cm). Lymphovascular invasion and poor differentiation were similar in both groups. Twenty percent of radical resection specimens had lymph node metastasis. Median follow-up was 5.6 years. Local recurrence was noted in a higher proportion of transanal excision patients (13.2 vs. 2.7 percent, P = 0.001).

After the first three injections, patients were then immunized three times with gp100 from the other species. Peripheral blood samples were analyzed at various time points following 10-day culture with gp100 peptides using multi-parametric flow cytometry. A total of 19 patients were enrolled, with 18 assessable for immune function and survival. 14 (74%) were male, with a median age of 56 years (range, 20-82).

Management and outcomes of anorectal infection in the cancer patient.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2009-08-01,"The objective of this retrospective cohort study is to examine the presentation and outcomes for a contemporary series of cancer patients with anorectal infection. In addition, we seek to identify factors which are associated with surgical intervention. The study cohort was identified from International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 codes for diagnosis of infection of the anal and rectal region and patients who underwent a surgical oncology consultation at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1/2000 and 12/2006. Clinical presentation, treatment rendered, and outcomes were retrospectively recorded. Of the 100 patients evaluated by the surgical oncology service for anorectal infection, 42 were treated nonoperatively and 58 underwent surgical intervention. Factors associated with surgical intervention based on logistic multivariable analysis included diagnosis of an abscess [odds ratio (OR) 10.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.9-38.5] and documentation of erythema on physical examination (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.1-8.4). Thrombocytopenia (platelets <50,000) was associated with nonoperative management (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.7). Incision and drainage was the most common surgical procedure (79%) while a wide debridement for a necrotizing soft tissue infection was required in two patients.

Long-term quality of life after radiotherapy for the treatment of anal cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-02-01,"Radiotherapy is the current standard of care for patients with localized squamous cell cancer of the anal canal. The goal of the current study was to evaluate long-term quality of life (QoL) in patients after this treatment. Questionnaires were mailed to 80 patients treated with definitive radiotherapy, with or without concurrent chemotherapy, for anal cancer, with a minimum 2-year interval after the completion of radiotherapy. The questionnaire included the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal (FACT-C), the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sexual Problems Scale, and questions regarding demographic characteristics and comorbidities. A total of 32 (40%) patients completed the questionnaire. There were no significant differences noted with regard to clinical and demographic characteristics between the survey responders and nonresponders. Among the 32 responders, the median dose of radiotherapy was 55 Grays (Gy), and 97% had received concurrent chemotherapy. The median interval between radiotherapy and survey participation was 5 years (range, 3-13 years). The median total FACT-C score was 108 (range, 47-128), of a maximum (best possible) score of 136. Patients who reported depression or anxiety and younger patients were found to have significantly lower total FACT-C scores.

Over the past several years, phase III studies have shown that combination mitomycin C (MMC) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) concurrent with radiotherapy had better outcomes than radiotherapy alone or 5-FU with radiotherapy. Two recent phase III studies using diverse treatment strategies showed that cisplatin and 5-FU were not superior to 5-FU and MMC; in one of the trials, use of cisplatin-based chemoradiation resulted in a higher rate of colostomy compared with mitomycin-based chemoradiation.

Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal: patterns and predictors of failure and implications for intensity-modulated radiation treatment planning.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2010-03-29,"Intensity-modulated radiation treatment (IMRT) is increasingly used in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCAC). Prevention of locoregional failure (LRF) using IMRT requires appropriate clinical target volume (CTV) definition. To better define the CTV for IMRT, we evaluated patterns and predictors of LRF in SCCAC patients given conventional radiation treatment. We reviewed records of 180 SCCAC patients treated with conventional radiation with or without chemotherapy at our institution between January 1990 and March 2007. All patients received radiation; the median primary tumor dose was 45 Gy. A total of 173 patients also received mitomycin-based chemotherapy. Median follow-up was 40 months. Actuarial 3-year colostomy-free survival was 89% and overall survival (OS) 88%. Actuarial 3-year LRF was 23%. A total of 45 patients had LRF, with 35 (78%) occurring locally in the primary site (25 local only, 10 local and regional); however, 20 (44%) had regional components of failure within the pelvis or inguinal nodes (10 regional only, 10 local and regional).

The most important risk factors are behaviors that predispose individuals to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection or immunosuppression. Anal cancer is generally preceded by high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (HGAIN), which is most prevalent in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive men who have sex with men. There is a general consensus that high-risk individuals may benefit from screening. Meta-analysis suggests that 80% of anal cancers could be avoided by vaccination against HPV 16/18. Nearly half of all patients with anal cancer present with rectal bleeding. Pain or sensation of a rectal mass is experienced in 30% of patients, whereas 20% have no tumor-specific symptoms. According to the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database, 50% of patients with anal cancer have disease localized to the anus, 29% have regional lymph node involvement or direct spread beyond the primary, and 12% have metastatic disease, while 9% have an unknown stage. Clinical staging of anal carcinoma requires a digital rectal exam and a computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Suspicious inguinal lymph nodes should be subject to pathologic confirmation by fine-needle aspiration.

Prognostic factors derived from a prospective database dictate clinical biology of anal cancer: the intergroup trial (RTOG 98-11).,Cancer,Cancer,2010-09-01,"Only 4 prospective randomized phase 3 trials have been reported for anal cancer. A prognostic factor analysis for anal cancer from a prospective database has been published from only 1 study (N = 110). To confirm and uncover new prognostic factors, we analyzed the prospective database of intergroup RTOG 98-11. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the baseline characteristics for 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were carried out. Various combinations of tumor diameter and clinically positive nodes (N(+)) were analyzed to identify subgroups. A total of 644 were assessable and analyzed. Tumor diameter >5 cm was associated with poorer 5-year DFS (P = .0003) and poorer 5-year OS (P = .0031), and N(+) was associated with poorer 5-year DFS (P </= .0001) and poorer 5-year OS (P = </= .0001) in the multivariate analysis. In stratified analyses, N(+) had more adverse influence on DFS and OS than did tumor diameter. Patients with >5-cm tumor and N(+) had the worst DFS (only 30% at 3 years compared with 74% for the best group; <5 cm primary and N0) and OS (only 48% at 4 years compared with 81% for the best group; <5 cm primary and N0).

Close distal margin and rectal cancer recurrence after sphincter-preserving rectal resection.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2010-10-01,"Negative surgical margins are important for local control of rectal cancer treated with sphincter-preserving surgery. However, the association of rectal cancer recurrence with close distal margin is not well established. Data were extracted from a prospective database of patients collected between 1991 and 2003. Included were 627 patients who underwent curative low anterior resection with total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer 2 to 12 cm from the anal verge. Three hundred ninety-nine patients received neoadjuvant therapy, 65 received postoperative adjuvant therapy alone, and 163 were treated with surgery alone. Median follow-up was 5.8 years. On multivariable analysis, overall recurrence was associated with pathologic stage, lymphovascular invasion, and distal margin. Mucosal recurrence was uncommon; only 16 events were recorded, and of those only 8 were at the initial site of isolated tumor recurrence; 7 of the 8 were surgically salvaged. On univariable analysis, mucosal recurrence was associated with close distal margin (5 vs 2% at 5 y) and lymphovascular invasion (7 vs 2%). Pelvic recurrence, other than isolated mucosal recurrence, was associated with distal location (6 vs 4% at 5 y) and lymphovascular invasion (11 vs 4%). Distal margin as a continuous variable was associated with overall recurrence (excluding isolated mucosal recurrence). Close distal resection margin identifies patients with increased risk of mucosal and overall cancer recurrence.

A mouse model for human anal cancer.,"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",Cancer Prev Res (Phila),2010-10-06,"Human anal cancers are associated with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) that cause other anogenital cancers and head and neck cancers. As with other cancers, HPV16 is the most common high-risk HPV in anal cancers. We describe the generation and characterization of a mouse model for human anal cancer. This model makes use of K14E6 and K14E7 transgenic mice in which the HPV16 E6 and E7 genes are directed in their expression to stratified squamous epithelia. HPV16 E6 and E7 possess oncogenic properties including, but not limited to, their capacity to inactivate the cellular tumor suppressors p53 and pRb, respectively. Both E6 and E7 were found to be functionally expressed in the anal epithelia of K14E6/K14E7 transgenic mice. To assess the susceptibility of these mice to anal cancer, mice were treated topically with dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), a chemical carcinogen that is known to induce squamous cell carcinomas in other sites. Nearly 50% of DMBA-treated HPV16 E6/E7 transgenic mice showed overt signs of tumors, whereas none of the like-treated nontransgenic mice showed tumors. Histopathologic analyses confirmed that the HPV16 transgenic mice were increased in their susceptibility to anal cancers and precancerous lesions. Biomarker analyses demonstrated that these mouse anal cancers exhibit properties that are similar to those observed in HPV-positive precursors to human anal cancer. This is the first mouse model for investigating the contributions of viral and cellular factors in anal carcinogenesis, and should provide a platform for assessing new therapeutic modalities for treating and/or preventing this type of cancer.",Journal Article,3394.0,33.0,Human cancers are associated with high-risk human papillomaviruses HPV that cause other anogenital cancers and head and cancers As with other cancers HPV16 is the most common high-risk HPV in cancers We describe the generation and characterization of a mouse model for human cancer This model makes use of K14E6 and K14E7 transgenic mice in which the HPV16 E6 and E7 genes are directed in their expression to stratified squamous epithelia HPV16 E6 and E7 possess oncogenic properties including but not limited to their capacity to inactivate the cellular tumor suppressors p53 and pRb respectively Both E6 and E7 were found to be functionally expressed in the epithelia of K14E6/K14E7 transgenic mice To assess the susceptibility of these mice to cancer mice were treated topically with dimethylbenz a anthracene DMBA a chemical carcinogen that is known to induce squamous cell carcinomas in other sites Nearly 50 of DMBA-treated HPV16 E6/E7 transgenic mice showed overt signs of tumors whereas none of the like-treated nontransgenic mice showed tumors Histopathologic analyses confirmed that the HPV16 transgenic mice were increased in their susceptibility to cancers and precancerous lesions Biomarker analyses demonstrated that these mouse cancers exhibit properties that are similar to those observed in HPV-positive precursors to human cancer This is the first mouse model for investigating the contributions of viral and cellular factors in carcinogenesis and should provide a platform for assessing new therapeutic modalities for treating and/or preventing this type of cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[171, 163, 32, 41, 5, 64, 43, 171, 14731, 933, 17, 708, 127, 13836, 163, 2, 718, 2, 163, 22, 5, 127, 163, 4048, 16, 3, 96, 186, 64, 43, 933, 4, 163, 21, 897, 3, 914, 2, 2136, 1, 8, 830, 202, 9, 171, 12, 26, 202, 4677, 119, 1, 19516, 2, 21634, 2862, 399, 4, 92, 3, 4048, 4837, 2, 4540, 214, 32, 1166, 4, 136, 55, 6, 1173, 691, 7743, 4048, 4837, 2, 4540, 5766, 1302, 1571, 141, 84, 44, 383, 6, 136, 2162, 6, 13772, 3, 763, 30, 5704, 624, 2, 8734, 106, 110, 4837, 2, 4540, 11, 204, 6, 40, 3772, 570, 4, 3, 7743, 1, 19516, 21634, 2862, 399, 6, 423, 3, 1432, 1, 46, 399, 6, 12, 399, 11, 73, 21012, 5, 23309, 8, 22193, 12356, 8, 3743, 7290, 17, 16, 440, 6, 1290, 691, 31, 826, 4, 127, 633, 1857, 212, 1, 12356, 73, 4048, 4837, 4540, 2862, 399, 224, 7192, 3408, 1, 57, 547, 1292, 1, 3, 733, 73, 20194, 399, 224, 57, 2630, 318, 557, 17, 3, 4048, 2862, 399, 11, 101, 4, 136, 1432, 6, 163, 2, 6605, 406, 901, 318, 264, 17, 46, 830, 163, 2239, 1571, 17, 32, 288, 6, 135, 164, 4, 933, 109, 4881, 6, 171, 12, 26, 16, 3, 157, 830, 202, 9, 3103, 3, 5621, 1, 1667, 2, 763, 130, 4, 1719, 2, 257, 377, 8, 2243, 9, 1977, 217, 189, 1558, 9, 1367, 2, 15, 3017, 26, 267, 1, 12]",1583.0,20947489,57

DP-IMRT was prescribed as follows: T2N0: 42 Gy, 1.5 Gy/fraction (fx) to elective nodal planning target volume (PTV) and 50.4 Gy, 1.8 Gy/fx to anal tumor PTV; T3-4N0-3: 45 Gy, 1.5 Gy/fx to elective nodal PTV, and 54 Gy, 1.8 Gy/fx to the anal tumor and metastatic nodal PTV >3 cm with 50.4 Gy, 1.68 Gy/fx to nodal PTVs ≤ 3 cm in size. Acute and late toxicity was reported by the treating physician. Actuarial analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Median age was 58 years; 67% female; 16% Stage I, 37% II; 42% III; 5% IV. Fourteen patients were immunocompromised: 21% HIV-positive and 12% on chronic immunosuppression. Median follow-up was 24 months (range, 0.6-43.5 months). Sixty percent completed chemoradiation without treatment interruption; median duration of treatment interruption was 2 days (range, 2-24 days). Acute Grade 3+ toxicity included: hematologic 51%, dermatologic 10%, gastrointestinal 7%, and genitourinary 7%. Two-year local control, overall survival, colostomy-free survival, and metastasis-free survival were 95%, 94%, 90%, and 92%, respectively.

Rapamycin inhibits anal carcinogenesis in two preclinical animal models.,"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",Cancer Prev Res (Phila),2010-12-01,"The incidence of anal cancer is increasing especially among HIV-infected persons in the HAART era. Treatment of this cancer is based upon traditional chemoradiotherapeutic approaches, which are associated with high morbidity and of limited effectiveness for patients with high-grade disease. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has been implicated in several human cancers, and is being investigated as a potential therapeutic target. In archival human anal cancers, we observed mTOR pathway activation. To assess response of anal cancer to mTOR inhibition, we utilized two newly developed mouse models, one in which anal cancers are induced to arise in HPV16 transgenic mice and the second a human anal cancer xenograft model. Using the transgenic mouse model, we assessed the preventative effect of rapamycin on neoplastic disease. We saw significant changes in the overall incidence of tumors, and tumor growth rate was also reduced. Using both the transgenic mouse and human anal xenograft mouse models, we studied the therapeutic effect of rapamycin on preexisting anal cancer. Rapamycin was found to significantly slow, if not stop, the growth of both mouse and human anal cancers. As has been seen in other cancers, rapamycin treatment led to an activation of the MAPK pathway. These results provide us cause to pursue further the evaluation of rapamycin as a therapeutic agent in the control of anal cancer.",Journal Article,3338.0,27.0,The incidence of cancer is increasing especially among HIV-infected persons in the HAART era Treatment of this cancer is based upon traditional chemoradiotherapeutic approaches which are associated with high morbidity and of limited effectiveness for patients with high-grade disease The mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR pathway has been implicated in several human cancers and is being investigated as a potential therapeutic target In archival human cancers we observed mTOR pathway activation To assess response of cancer to mTOR inhibition we utilized two newly developed mouse models one in which cancers are induced to arise in HPV16 transgenic mice and the second a human cancer xenograft model Using the transgenic mouse model we assessed the preventative effect of rapamycin on neoplastic disease We saw significant changes in the overall incidence of tumors and tumor growth rate was also reduced Using both the transgenic mouse and human xenograft mouse models we studied the therapeutic effect of rapamycin on preexisting cancer Rapamycin was found to significantly slow if not stop the growth of both mouse and human cancers As has been seen in other cancers rapamycin treatment led to an activation of the MAPK pathway These results provide us cause to pursue further the evaluation of rapamycin as a therapeutic agent in the control of cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 287, 1, 12, 16, 602, 1093, 107, 1942, 3369, 4327, 4, 3, 6776, 1713, 24, 1, 26, 12, 16, 90, 1548, 1847, 59641, 611, 92, 32, 41, 5, 64, 787, 2, 1, 383, 1236, 9, 7, 5, 64, 88, 34, 3, 2359, 283, 1, 1620, 873, 308, 71, 85, 1771, 4, 392, 171, 163, 2, 16, 486, 565, 22, 8, 174, 189, 283, 4, 3967, 171, 163, 21, 164, 873, 308, 363, 6, 423, 51, 1, 12, 6, 873, 297, 21, 2080, 100, 732, 276, 830, 274, 104, 4, 92, 163, 32, 277, 6, 3043, 4, 4048, 2862, 399, 2, 3, 419, 8, 171, 12, 1330, 202, 75, 3, 2862, 830, 202, 21, 275, 3, 10435, 254, 1, 1620, 23, 2000, 34, 21, 9257, 93, 400, 4, 3, 63, 287, 1, 57, 2, 30, 129, 116, 10, 120, 405, 75, 110, 3, 2862, 830, 2, 171, 1330, 830, 274, 21, 656, 3, 189, 254, 1, 1620, 23, 5004, 12, 1620, 10, 204, 6, 97, 3645, 492, 44, 7142, 3, 129, 1, 110, 830, 2, 171, 163, 22, 71, 85, 527, 4, 127, 163, 1620, 24, 836, 6, 35, 363, 1, 3, 1748, 308, 46, 99, 377, 843, 708, 6, 7874, 195, 3, 451, 1, 1620, 22, 8, 189, 420, 4, 3, 182, 1, 12]",1359.0,21149330,58
Intensity-modulated radiation therapy versus conventional radiation therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal.,Cancer,Cancer,2011-02-01,"The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes in patients with anal canal squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) who were treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy by either intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or conventional radiotherapy (CRT). Forty-six patients who received definitive chemoradiotherapy from January 1993 to August 2009 were included. Forty-five patients received 5-fluorouracil with mitomycin C (n = 39) or cisplatin (n = 6). Seventeen (37%) were treated with CRT and 29 (63%) with IMRT. The median dose was 54 Gy in both groups. Median follow-up was 26 months (CRT) and 32 months (IMRT). T3-T4 stage (P = .18) and lymph node-positive disease (P = .6) were similar between groups. The CRT group required longer treatment duration (57 days vs 40 days, P < .0001), more treatment breaks (88% vs 34.5%, P = .001), and longer breaks (12 days vs 1.5 days, P < .0001) than patients treated with IMRT. Eleven (65%) patients in the CRT group experienced grade >2 nonhematologic toxicity compared with 6 (21%) patients in the IMRT group (P = .003). The 3-year overall survival (OS), locoregional control (LRC), and progression-free survival were 87.8%, 91.9%, and 84.2%, respectively, for the IMRT groups and 51.8%, 56.7%, and 56.7%, respectively, for the CRT group (all P < .01). On multivariate analysis, T stage, use of IMRT, and treatment duration were associated with OS, and T stage and use of IMRT were associated with LRC.

A phase II trial of neoadjuvant chemoradiation and local excision for T2N0 rectal cancer: preliminary results of the ACOSOG Z6041 trial.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2011-07-14,"We designed American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z6041, a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, phase II trial to assess the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT) and local excision (LE) for T2N0 rectal cancer. Here, we report tumor response, CRT-related toxicity, and perioperative complications (PCs). Clinically staged T2N0 rectal cancer patients were treated with capecitabine and oxaliplatin during radiation followed by LE. Because of toxicity, capecitabine and radiation doses were reduced. LE was performed 6 weeks after CRT. Patients were evaluated for clinical and pathologic response. CRT-related complications and PCs were recorded. Ninety patients were accrued; 6 received nonprotocol treatment. The remaining 84 were 65% male; median age 63 years; 83% Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score 0; 92% white; mean tumor size 2.9 cm; and average distance from anal verge 5.1 cm. Five patients were considered ineligible. Therapy was completed per protocol in 79 patients, but two patients did not undergo LE. Among 77 eligible patients who underwent LE, 34 patients achieved a pathologic complete response (44%) and 49 (64%) tumors were downstaged (ypT0-1), but 4 patients (5%) had ypT3 tumors. Five LE specimens contained lymph nodes; one T3 tumor had a positive node. All but one patient had negative margins. Thirty-three (39%) of 84 patients developed CRT-related grade ≥3 complications.

Surgery and high-dose-rate intraoperative radiation therapy for recurrent squamous-cell carcinoma of the anal canal.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2011-09-01,"Locoregionally recurrent squamous-cell carcinoma of the anal canal is managed with salvage surgery. High-dose-rate intraoperative radiation therapy has been used in selected patients with this disease to reduce the risk of local recurrence. The aim of this article is to present our institutional experience with this technique. Medical records of 14 patients with locoregionally recurrent squamous-cell carcinoma of the anal canal who underwent this technique between 1992 and 2007 were reviewed. The study was conducted at an academic cancer center. The median age was 45 years (range, 36-77), and 13 of the patients were women. All had prior radiation with or without chemotherapy. The surgical procedures included abdominoperineal resection with or without sacrectomy (n = 8), low anterior resection (n = 2), and pelvic exenteration (n = 4). The median radiation dose was 1500 cGy (range, 1500-1750). All cases of radiographic invasion of adjacent structures correctly predicted pathologic invasion. There was pathologic invasion into adjacent structures in 11 cases (79%), and adherence to the sacrum without invasion in 2 cases (14%). Surgical margins were positive (n = 6), close (<1 mm) (n = 3), and negative (n = 5). The median follow-up from our technique was 17 months (range, 5-145). Subsequent recurrence occurred in 11 cases, at a median of 8 months from treatment. Two-year actuarial control was 7.1%, and the overall survival was 21.4%. Acute toxicities included wound-healing complications (n = 6); gastrointestinal obstruction (n = 5); neurogenic bladder (n = 1); ureteral stricture (n = 3); and peripheral neuropathy (n = 2). This is a small retrospective series in which the meaningful analysis of associations between clinical variables and outcomes was not possible. Salvage surgery with high-dose-rate intraoperative radiation therapy did not appear to be associated with a locoregional control or survival benefit in this series. The addition of high-dose-rate intraoperative radiation therapy to salvage surgery is insufficient to compensate for positive surgical margins. Preoperative imaging should be used to aid in patient selection to identify those patients in whom negative margins can be obtained and to aid in the determination of appropriate salvage surgery.",Journal Article,3064.0,20.0,Locoregionally recurrent squamous-cell carcinoma of the canal is managed with salvage surgery High-dose-rate intraoperative radiation therapy has been used in selected patients with this disease to reduce the risk of local recurrence The aim of this article is to present our institutional experience with this technique Medical records of 14 patients with locoregionally recurrent squamous-cell carcinoma of the canal who underwent this technique between 1992 and 2007 were reviewed The study was conducted at an academic cancer center The median age was 45 years range 36-77 and 13 of the patients were women All had prior radiation with or without chemotherapy The surgical procedures included abdominoperineal resection with or without sacrectomy n 8 low anterior resection n 2 and pelvic exenteration n 4 The median radiation dose was 1500 cGy range 1500-1750 All cases of radiographic invasion of adjacent structures correctly predicted pathologic invasion There was pathologic invasion into adjacent structures in 11 cases 79 and adherence to the sacrum without invasion in 2 cases 14 Surgical margins were positive n 6 close 1 mm n 3 and negative n 5 The median follow-up from our technique was 17 months range 5-145 Subsequent recurrence occurred in 11 cases at a median of 8 months from treatment Two-year actuarial control was 7.1 and the overall survival was 21.4 Acute toxicities included wound-healing complications n 6 obstruction n 5 neurogenic n 1 ureteral stricture n 3 and peripheral neuropathy n 2 This is a small retrospective series in which the meaningful analysis of associations between clinical variables and outcomes was not possible Salvage surgery with high-dose-rate intraoperative radiation therapy did not appear to be associated with a locoregional control or survival benefit in this series The addition of high-dose-rate intraoperative radiation therapy to salvage surgery is insufficient to compensate for positive surgical margins Preoperative imaging should be used to aid in patient selection to identify those patients in whom negative margins can be obtained and to aid in the determination of appropriate salvage surgery,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6410, 387, 691, 31, 134, 1, 3, 5614, 16, 2231, 5, 992, 152, 64, 61, 116, 1720, 121, 36, 71, 85, 95, 4, 715, 7, 5, 26, 34, 6, 969, 3, 43, 1, 293, 146, 3, 1130, 1, 26, 946, 16, 6, 364, 114, 1115, 730, 5, 26, 1312, 484, 1064, 1, 213, 7, 5, 6410, 387, 691, 31, 134, 1, 3, 5614, 54, 208, 26, 1312, 59, 2846, 2, 1307, 11, 446, 3, 45, 10, 426, 28, 35, 1916, 12, 574, 3, 52, 89, 10, 512, 60, 184, 511, 849, 2, 233, 1, 3, 7, 11, 117, 62, 42, 324, 121, 5, 15, 187, 56, 3, 221, 1369, 159, 8177, 170, 5, 15, 187, 14212, 78, 66, 154, 2882, 170, 78, 18, 2, 1110, 5668, 78, 39, 3, 52, 121, 61, 10, 7204, 3071, 184, 7204, 34443, 62, 140, 1, 1580, 578, 1, 2086, 2414, 4911, 783, 510, 578, 125, 10, 510, 578, 237, 2086, 2414, 4, 175, 140, 842, 2, 2149, 6, 3, 11629, 187, 578, 4, 18, 140, 213, 221, 1012, 11, 109, 78, 49, 2336, 14, 321, 78, 27, 2, 199, 78, 33, 3, 52, 166, 126, 29, 114, 1312, 10, 269, 53, 184, 33, 4058, 706, 146, 489, 4, 175, 140, 28, 8, 52, 1, 66, 53, 29, 24, 100, 111, 2361, 182, 10, 67, 14, 2, 3, 63, 25, 10, 239, 39, 286, 385, 159, 2689, 4706, 521, 78, 49, 3191, 78, 33, 16731, 78, 14, 7213, 6673, 78, 27, 2, 672, 1751, 78, 18, 26, 16, 8, 302, 459, 988, 4, 92, 3, 2538, 65, 1, 685, 59, 38, 682, 2, 123, 10, 44, 899, 992, 152, 5, 64, 61, 116, 1720, 121, 36, 205, 44, 1322, 6, 40, 41, 5, 8, 1325, 182, 15, 25, 247, 4, 26, 988, 3, 352, 1, 64, 61, 116, 1720, 121, 36, 6, 992, 152, 16, 3027, 6, 13748, 9, 109, 221, 1012, 498, 270, 257, 40, 95, 6, 2427, 4, 69, 881, 6, 255, 135, 7, 4, 953, 199, 1012, 122, 40, 683, 2, 6, 2427, 4, 3, 3104, 1, 870, 992, 152]",2162.0,21825888,27
Intensity-modulated radiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal: efficacy of a low daily dose to clinically negative regions.,"Radiation oncology (London, England)",Radiat Oncol,2011-10-06,"We aimed to assess outcomes of patients with anal cancer who underwent intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and received less than 1.80 Gy/day.

Accuracy of endorectal ultrasound for measurement of the closest predicted radial mesorectal margin for rectal cancer.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2012-01-01,"At present, pelvic phased array-coil MR is used as the validated imaging modality for measurement of the closest predicted radial mesorectal margin for rectal cancer. Endorectal ultrasound is also used to assess the clinical stage of the cancer that will determine the recommendation for neoadjuvant chemoradiation, but it has not been used to assess the closest predicted radial margin. We propose to assess endorectal ultrasound identification of mesorectal margins and the measurement of the closest predicted radial tumor-mesorectal margin. Patients included were those having MRI and endorectal ultrasound for evaluation of primary rectal cancer in 2010 at a tertiary cancer referral colorectal clinic. Clinical data, MRI, and endorectal ultrasound images were assessed. Two independent retrospective measurements of mesorectal dimensions were correlated to evaluate the reproducibility of identifying mesorectal margins. MRI and endorectal ultrasound images were compared for independent measurements of mesorectal dimensions and of the closest predicted radial mesorectal margin. MRI and endorectal ultrasound determination of margin involvement were assessed for agreement. Fifty-two patients were studied with an average rectal cancer distance to the anal verge of 6.8 cm. Interobserver correlation coefficients of endorectal ultrasound mesorectal dimensions ranged from 0.47 to 0.53 (p < 0.01).

While combined therapy of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), mitomycin, and radiation is the treatment of choice for locoregional anal cancer, the treatment of metastatic disease is less established. 5-FU and cisplatin combination has been adopted as the first-line treatment of choice for metastatic disease based on several phase II studies. However, no standard therapy has been established for stage IV anal cancer after the failure of this combination. Paclitaxel, a microtubule-stabilizing chemotherapeutic agent, has established clinical activity in squamous cell cancer of the head and neck. One prior report described the activity of paclitaxel in five patients with anal cancer. In this report, we describe our experience using this agent in seven patients suffering from metastatic anal cancer with prior progression on cisplatin and 5-FU.

Reverse-hybrid robotic mesorectal excision for rectal cancer.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2012-02-01,"The robotic system offers potential technical advantages over laparoscopy for total mesorectal excision with radical lymphadenectomy for rectal cancer. However, the requirement for fixed docking limits its utility when the working volume is large or patient repositioning is required. The purpose of this study was to evaluate short-term outcomes associated with a novel setup to perform total mesorectal excision and radical lymphadenectomy for rectal cancer by the use of a ""reverse"" hybrid robotic-laparoscopic approach. This is a prospective consecutive cohort observational study of patients who underwent robotic rectal cancer resection from January 2009 to March 2011. During the study period, a technique of reverse-hybrid robotic-laparoscopic rectal resection with radical lymphadenectomy was developed. This technique involves reversal of the operative sequence with lymphovascular and rectal dissection to precede proximal colonic mobilization. This technique evolved from a conventional-hybrid resection with laparoscopic vascular control, colonic mobilization, and robotic pelvic dissection. Perioperative and short-term oncologic outcomes were analyzed. Thirty patients underwent reverse-hybrid resection. Median tumor location was 5 cm (interquartile range 3-9) from the anal verge. Median BMI was 27.6 (interquartile range 25.0-32.1 kg/m). Twenty (66.7%) received neoadjuvant chemoradiation. There were no conversions. Median blood loss was 100 mL (interquartile range 75-200). Total operation time was a median 369 (interquartile range 306-410) minutes. Median docking time was 6 (interquartile range 5-8) minutes, and console time was 98 (interquartile range 88-140) minutes. Resection was R0 in all patients; no patients had an incomplete mesorectal resection. Six patients (20%) underwent extended lymph node dissection or en bloc resection.

Setup variations in radiotherapy of anal cancer: advantages of target volume reduction using image-guided radiation treatment.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-01-26,"To define setup variations in the radiation treatment (RT) of anal cancer and to report the advantages of image-guided RT (IGRT) in terms of reduction of target volume and treatment-related side effects. Twelve consecutive patients with anal cancer treated by combined chemoradiation by use of helical tomotherapy from March 2007 to November 2008 were selected. With patients immobilized and positioned in place, megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT) scans were performed before each treatment and were automatically registered to planning CT scans. Patients were shifted per the registration data and treated. A total of 365 MVCT scans were analyzed. The primary site received a median dose of 55 Gy. To evaluate the potential dosimetric advantage(s) of IGRT, cases were replanned according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0529, with and without adding recommended setup variations from the current study. Significant setup variations were observed throughout the course of RT. The standard deviations for systematic setup correction in the anterior-posterior (AP), lateral, and superior-inferior (SI) directions and roll rotation were 1.1, 3.6, and 3.2 mm, and 0.3°, respectively. The average random setup variations were 3.8, 5.5, and 2.9 mm, and 0.5°, respectively. Without daily IGRT, margins of 4.9, 11.1, and 8.5 mm in the AP, lateral, and SI directions would have been needed to ensure that the planning target volume (PTV) received ≥95% of the prescribed dose. Conversely, daily IGRT required no extra margins on PTV and resulted in a significant reduction of V15 and V45 of intestine and V10 of pelvic bone marrow. Favorable toxicities were observed, except for acute hematologic toxicity.

Normal tissue complication probability modeling of acute hematologic toxicity in patients treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-03-11,"To identify dosimetric parameters that correlate with acute hematologic toxicity (HT) in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT). We analyzed 33 patients receiving CRT. Pelvic bone (PBM) was contoured for each patient and divided into subsites: ilium, lower pelvis (LP), and lumbosacral spine (LSS). The volume of each region receiving at least 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 Gy was calculated. Endpoints included grade ≥3 HT (HT3+) and hematologic event (HE), defined as any grade ≥2 HT with a modification in chemotherapy dose. Normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) was evaluated with the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) model. Logistic regression was used to test associations between HT and dosimetric/clinical parameters. Nine patients experienced HT3+ and 15 patients experienced HE. Constrained optimization of the LKB model for HT3+ yielded the parameters m = 0.175, n = 1, and TD(50) = 32 Gy. With this model, mean PBM doses of 25 Gy, 27.5 Gy, and 31 Gy result in a 10%, 20%, and 40% risk of HT3+, respectively. Compared with patients with mean PBM dose of <30 Gy, patients with mean PBM dose ≥30 Gy had a 14-fold increase in the odds of developing HT3+ (p = 0.005). Several low-dose radiation parameters (i.e., PBM-V10) were associated with the development of HT3+ and HE. No association was found with the ilium, LP, or clinical factors. LKB modeling confirms the expectation that PBM acts like a parallel organ, implying that the mean dose to the organ is a useful predictor for toxicity. Low-dose radiation to the PBM was also associated with clinically significant HT. Keeping the mean PBM dose <22.5 Gy and <25 Gy is associated with a 5% and 10% risk of HT, respectively.",Journal Article,2872.0,40.0,To identify dosimetric parameters that correlate with acute hematologic toxicity HT in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the canal treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy CRT We analyzed 33 patients receiving CRT Pelvic PBM was contoured for each patient and divided into subsites ilium lower pelvis LP and lumbosacral spine LSS The volume of each region receiving at least 5 10 15 20 30 and 40 Gy was calculated Endpoints included grade ≥3 HT HT3+ and hematologic event HE defined as any grade ≥2 HT with a modification in chemotherapy dose Normal tissue complication probability NTCP was evaluated with the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman LKB model Logistic regression was used to test associations between HT and dosimetric/clinical parameters Nine patients experienced HT3+ and 15 patients experienced HE Constrained optimization of the LKB model for HT3+ yielded the parameters m 0.175 n 1 and TD 50 32 Gy With this model mean PBM doses of 25 Gy 27.5 Gy and 31 Gy result in a 10 20 and 40 risk of HT3+ respectively Compared with patients with mean PBM dose of 30 Gy patients with mean PBM dose ≥30 Gy had a 14-fold increase in the odds of developing HT3+ p 0.005 Several low-dose radiation parameters i.e. PBM-V10 were associated with the development of HT3+ and HE No association was found with the ilium LP or clinical factors LKB modeling confirms the expectation that PBM acts like a parallel organ implying that the mean dose to the organ is a useful predictor for toxicity Low-dose radiation to the PBM was also associated with clinically significant HT Keeping the mean PBM dose 22.5 Gy and 25 Gy is associated with a 5 and 10 risk of HT respectively,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 255, 3187, 1038, 17, 1513, 5, 286, 813, 155, 3152, 4, 7, 5, 691, 31, 134, 1, 3, 5614, 73, 5, 1057, 1464, 1089, 21, 311, 466, 7, 357, 1089, 1110, 9215, 10, 6476, 9, 296, 69, 2, 2176, 237, 11239, 18295, 280, 3270, 6427, 2, 15598, 2342, 11184, 3, 433, 1, 296, 1053, 357, 28, 506, 33, 79, 167, 179, 201, 2, 327, 381, 10, 981, 1387, 159, 88, 2608, 3152, 10611, 2, 813, 774, 3174, 395, 22, 500, 88, 3107, 3152, 5, 8, 2437, 4, 56, 61, 295, 246, 1447, 1320, 13479, 10, 194, 5, 3, 27159, 27160, 27161, 20766, 202, 812, 320, 10, 95, 6, 412, 685, 59, 3152, 2, 3187, 38, 1038, 762, 7, 592, 10611, 2, 167, 7, 592, 3174, 9133, 3980, 1, 3, 20766, 202, 9, 10611, 2178, 3, 1038, 188, 13, 3300, 78, 14, 2, 8325, 212, 531, 381, 5, 26, 202, 313, 9215, 415, 1, 243, 381, 428, 33, 381, 2, 456, 381, 757, 4, 8, 79, 179, 2, 327, 43, 1, 10611, 106, 72, 5, 7, 5, 313, 9215, 61, 1, 201, 381, 7, 5, 313, 9215, 61, 7783, 381, 42, 8, 213, 1116, 344, 4, 3, 610, 1, 931, 10611, 19, 13, 1614, 392, 154, 61, 121, 1038, 70, 563, 9215, 10724, 11, 41, 5, 3, 193, 1, 10611, 2, 3174, 77, 248, 10, 204, 5, 3, 18295, 6427, 15, 38, 130, 20766, 2057, 5120, 3, 9988, 17, 9215, 4459, 733, 8, 2755, 1259, 7885, 17, 3, 313, 61, 6, 3, 1259, 16, 8, 999, 980, 9, 155, 154, 61, 121, 6, 3, 9215, 10, 120, 41, 5, 505, 93, 3152, 10991, 3, 313, 9215, 61, 350, 33, 381, 2, 243, 381, 16, 41, 5, 8, 33, 2, 79, 43, 1, 3152, 106]",1660.0,22414279,47

The records of patients undergoing low anterior resection (1991-2010) for rectal adenocarcinoma (≤15 cm from anal verge) were retrospectively analyzed using a prospectively collected colorectal database. Data (age, gender, stage, defunctioning stoma, neoadjuvant treatment, distance from anal verge, anastomotic leak) were collected. Clinical leakage was defined as anastomotic complication requiring intervention or interventional radiology within 60 days of surgery. Estimated local recurrence, overall survival, and disease-specific survival were compared using log-rank method and Cox regression analysis. 1127 patients were included, with 5.6-year median follow-up. The incidence of clinical anastomotic leak was 3.5%. Sixteen of 677 with defunctioning stoma (2.2%) developed clinical leak; 24 of 450 without stoma (6.3%) developed leak (P = 0.005). There were no perioperative deaths among patients with clinical leakage. When stratified for defunctioning stoma, there was no association between clinical leak and local recurrence, disease-free survival, or overall survival. On multivariable analysis, when controlling for neoadjuvant therapy, distance of tumor from anal verge, defunctioning stoma, and pathologic stage, clinical leak was not associated with time to local recurrence, disease-free survival, or overall survival. In this cohort, anastomotic leakage was not associated with risk of local recurrence. Defunctioning stoma was associated with lower incidence of clinical leakage but not with difference in oncologic outcome.

Pulmonary recurrence predominates after combined modality therapy for rectal cancer: an original retrospective study.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2012-07-01,"To characterize patterns of recurrence in locally advanced rectal cancer treated with combined modality therapy (CMT): neoadjuvant chemoradiation + total mesorectal excision + adjuvant chemotherapy. A total of 593 consecutive rectal cancer patients (1998 to 2007) with locally advanced (stage II/III) disease (noted on endorectal ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging) who received CMT were analyzed for patterns of recurrence. After median 44-month follow-up (interquartile range, 25 to 64 months), 119 patients (20%) recurred: 105 distant, 7 local, 7 local and distant, and 112 distant-only recurrence. Ninety-three (78%) had single-organ recurrence, and 26 (22%) had multiple-organ recurrence. The most common site of distant recurrence was lung (69% of all patients with distant relapse); 20% had liver recurrence. Fourteen patients (2.4%) recurred locally. Pulmonary metastases were most commonly identified by computed tomographic scan versus abnormal positron emission tomographic (PET) scan or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Risk factors associated with pulmonary recurrence were the following: pathologic stage, tumor distance from anal verge, lymphovascular or perineural invasion. Five-year freedom from pulmonary recurrence for patients with 0, 1, 2, or 3 risk factors was 99%, 90%, 61%, and 42%, respectively. Thirty of 59 patents with pulmonary recurrence underwent lung metastasectomy; 3-year freedom from recurrence was 37%. Unlike colon cancer, which most frequently recurs in the liver, locally advanced rectal cancer treated with CMT relapses most frequently in the lung. Pulmonary metastasis was associated with advanced pathologic stage, low-lying tumor, lymphovascular invasion, or perineural invasion. Confirmation of pulmonary metastasis usually requires serial imaging because metastases are often small when initially detected, well below the resolution of PET, and not necessarily associated with elevated CEA.

Phys.,2012-06-09,"To test the hypothesis that intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) can reduce radiation dose to functional bone marrow (BM) in patients with pelvic malignancies (phase IA) and estimate the clinical feasibility and acute toxicity associated with this technique (phase IB). We enrolled 31 subjects (19 with gynecologic cancer and 12 with anal cancer) in an institutional review board-approved prospective trial (6 in the pilot study, 10 in phase IA, and 15 in phase IB). The mean age was 52 years; 8 of 31 patients (26%) were men. Twenty-one subjects completed (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) simulation and magnetic resonance imaging by use of quantitative IDEAL (IDEAL IQ; GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI). The PET/CT and IDEAL IQ were registered, and BM subvolumes were segmented above the mean standardized uptake value and below the mean fat fraction within the pelvis and lumbar spine; their intersection was designated as functional BM for IMRT planning. Functional BM-sparing vs total BM-sparing IMRT plans were compared in 12 subjects; 10 were treated with functional BM-sparing pelvic IMRT per protocol. In gynecologic cancer patients, the mean functional BM V(10) (volume receiving ≥10 Gy) and V(20) (volume receiving ≥20 Gy) were 85% vs 94% (P<.0001) and 70% vs 82% (P<.0001), respectively, for functional BM-sparing IMRT vs total BM-sparing IMRT. In anal cancer patients, the corresponding values were 75% vs 77% (P=.06) and 62% vs 67% (P=.002), respectively.

Whole-mount pathologic analysis of rectal cancer following neoadjuvant therapy: implications of margin status on long-term oncologic outcome.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2012-08-01,"Extent of distal resection margins in rectal cancer surgery remains controversial. We set out to determine the long-term oncologic impact of resection margins in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer using a comprehensive pathologic whole-mount section analysis. It has been demonstrated that there is minimal disease beyond the gross tumor margin after neoadjuvant combined modality therapy (CMT) for rectal cancer. Although this suggests that close resection margins may be used for sphincter preservation, the long-term oncologic impact of this approach is unclear. We prospectively enrolled 103 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant CMT. Whole-mount pathologic analysis was performed, and clinicopathologic variables were correlated with disease-specific survival (DSS). : Sphincter preservation was achieved in 80% of patients, and the median distal margin was 2 cm (0.1 to 10 cm). There were 22 patients (21%) with distal margins 1 cm or less and no patient had a positive distal margin. Median radial margin was 1 cm and 4 patients (4%) had a margin of 1 mm or less. Viable distal intramural tumor spread was found in 3 patients (2.7%) and in all cases was limited to 1 cm or less from the gross tumor edge. At a median follow-up of 68 months, 5-year DSS was 86% and 1 patient experienced a local recurrence. Factors predictive of worse DSS included advanced tumor (T) and nodal (N) stage, tumor progression on neoadjuvant CMT, lack of a complete pathologic response, tumor location of 5 cm or less from the anal verge, and neurovascular invasion.

Reproducibility and genital sparing with a vaginal dilator used for female anal cancer patients.,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,Radiother Oncol,2012-07-26,"Acute vulvitis, acute urethritis, and permanent sexual dysfunction are common among patients treated with chemoradiation for squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal. Avoidance of the genitalia may reduce sexual dysfunction. A vaginal dilator may help delineate and displace the vulva and lower vagina away from the primary tumor. The goal of this study was to evaluate the positional reproducibility and vaginal sparing with the use of a vaginal dilator. Ten female patients treated with IMRT for anal cancer were included in this study. A silicone vaginal dilator measuring 29 mm in diameter and 114 mm in length was inserted into the vagina before simulation and each treatment. The reproducibility of dilator placement was investigated with antero-posterior and lateral images acquired daily. Weekly cone beam CT (CBCT) imaging was used to confirm coverage of the GTV, which was typically posterior and inferior to the dilator apex. Finally, a planning study was performed to compare the vaginal doses for these 10 patients to a comparable group of 10 female patients who were treated for anal cancer with IMRT without vaginal dilators. The absolute values of the location of the dilator apex were 7.0 ± 7.8mm in the supero-inferior direction, 7.5 ± 5.5 mm in the antero-posterior, and 3.8 ± 3.1mm in the lateral direction. Coverage of the GTV and CTV was confirmed from CBCT images. The mean dose to the vagina was lower by 5.5 Gy, on average, for the vaginal dilator patients, compared to patients treated without vaginal dilators. The vaginal dilator tended to be inserted more inferiorly during treatment than during simulation. For these ten patients, this did not compromise tumor coverage. Combined with IMRT treatment planning, use of a vaginal dilator could allow for maximum sparing of female genitalia for patients undergoing radiation therapy for anal cancer.",Journal Article,2735.0,10.0,Acute vulvitis acute urethritis and permanent sexual dysfunction are common among patients treated with chemoradiation for squamous cell carcinoma of the canal Avoidance of the genitalia may reduce sexual dysfunction A dilator may help delineate and displace the vulva and lower vagina away from the primary tumor The goal of this study was to evaluate the positional reproducibility and sparing with the use of a dilator Ten female patients treated with IMRT for cancer were included in this study A silicone dilator measuring 29 mm in diameter and 114 mm in length was inserted into the vagina before simulation and each treatment The reproducibility of dilator placement was investigated with antero-posterior and lateral images acquired daily Weekly cone beam CT CBCT imaging was used to confirm coverage of the GTV which was typically posterior and inferior to the dilator apex Finally a planning study was performed to compare the doses for these 10 patients to a comparable group of 10 female patients who were treated for cancer with IMRT without dilators The absolute values of the location of the dilator apex were 7.0 ± 7.8mm in the supero-inferior direction 7.5 ± 5.5 mm in the antero-posterior and 3.8 ± 3.1mm in the lateral direction Coverage of the GTV and CTV was confirmed from CBCT images The mean dose to the vagina was lower by 5.5 Gy on average for the dilator patients compared to patients treated without dilators The dilator tended to be inserted more inferiorly during treatment than during simulation For these ten patients this did not compromise tumor coverage Combined with IMRT treatment planning use of a dilator could allow for maximum sparing of female genitalia for patients undergoing radiation therapy for cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[286, 61711, 286, 47311, 2, 4377, 2232, 1527, 32, 186, 107, 7, 73, 5, 975, 9, 691, 31, 134, 1, 3, 5614, 5863, 1, 3, 33952, 68, 969, 2232, 1527, 8, 17967, 68, 987, 5092, 2, 17651, 3, 9263, 2, 280, 7553, 6565, 29, 3, 86, 30, 3, 1326, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 376, 3, 16788, 4688, 2, 1851, 5, 3, 119, 1, 8, 17967, 1618, 1061, 7, 73, 5, 964, 9, 12, 11, 159, 4, 26, 45, 8, 18762, 17967, 2978, 462, 321, 4, 2549, 2, 3803, 321, 4, 1318, 10, 9882, 237, 3, 7553, 348, 4026, 2, 296, 24, 3, 4688, 1, 17967, 2613, 10, 565, 5, 35407, 3028, 2, 3855, 1572, 1294, 391, 709, 6939, 1345, 425, 5187, 270, 10, 95, 6, 1843, 2139, 1, 3, 4046, 92, 10, 1969, 3028, 2, 1663, 6, 3, 17967, 8670, 1368, 8, 1349, 45, 10, 173, 6, 932, 3, 415, 9, 46, 79, 7, 6, 8, 1279, 87, 1, 79, 1061, 7, 54, 11, 73, 9, 12, 5, 964, 187, 47312, 3, 1766, 1030, 1, 3, 1147, 1, 3, 17967, 8670, 11, 67, 13, 810, 67, 39737, 4, 3, 38987, 1663, 4651, 67, 33, 810, 33, 33, 321, 4, 3, 35407, 3028, 2, 27, 66, 810, 27, 22731, 4, 3, 3855, 4651, 2139, 1, 3, 4046, 2, 3402, 10, 557, 29, 5187, 1572, 3, 313, 61, 6, 3, 7553, 10, 280, 20, 33, 33, 381, 23, 1011, 9, 3, 17967, 7, 72, 6, 7, 73, 187, 47312, 3, 17967, 3886, 6, 40, 9882, 80, 25313, 190, 24, 76, 190, 4026, 9, 46, 1618, 7, 26, 205, 44, 4665, 30, 2139, 397, 5, 964, 24, 1349, 119, 1, 8, 17967, 359, 1700, 9, 689, 1851, 1, 1061, 33952, 9, 7, 479, 121, 36, 9, 12]",1748.0,22841019,51
Morbidity of staged proctectomy after hepatectomy for colorectal cancer: a matched case-control analysis.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2012-08-30,"Proctectomy after hepatectomy, or the reverse approach, is an alternative to traditional sequencing for advanced liver metastases with asymptomatic colorectal primary tumors. We sought to evaluate the surgical morbidity of proctectomy for colorectal cancer after previous liver surgery. A single-institution colorectal database was queried for patients treated with proctectomy after previous hepatectomy from 2003 to 2011. Reverse-approach patients (n = 31) were matched 1:2 with a cohort of standard proctectomy patients (n = 62) using operation, age, gender, and surgeon. Perioperative factors were analyzed by univariate/multivariate models for associations with complications graded by Dindo-Clavien criteria. Thirty-one patients with adenocarcinoma ≤ 20 cm from the anal verge underwent proctectomy after hepatectomy. Median time from hepatectomy to proctectomy was 5.1 months. Median tumor distance was 8.5 cm. Before proctectomy, patients underwent 28 (90 %) major hepatectomies and 7 (22 %) portal vein embolizations. There were no perioperative deaths. Reverse-approach patients did not differ from control patients in operation, demographics, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, tumor distance, operative time, estimated blood loss, length of stay, or complication rates (p > 0.05). Grade 2 or higher complications developed in 42 % of reverse-approach and 27 % of standard proctectomies (p = 0.17). Grade 3 or higher complications developed in 10 % and 8 %, respectively (p = 1.00). Independent predictors of complications of grade 2 or higher were BMI ≥30 kg/m(2) (p = 0.007), operative time ≥300 min (p = 0.012), intraoperative transfusion (p = 0.044), concurrent procedures (p = 0.024), and age ≥50 years (p = 0.030).

"Long-term update of US GI intergroup RTOG 98-11 phase III trial for anal carcinoma: survival, relapse, and colostomy failure with concurrent chemoradiation involving fluorouracil/mitomycin versus fluorouracil/cisplatin.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2012-11-13,"On initial publication of GI Intergroup Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 98-11 [A Phase III Randomized Study of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), Mitomycin, and Radiotherapy Versus 5-Fluorouracil, Cisplatin and Radiotherapy in Carcinoma of the Anal Canal], concurrent chemoradiation (CCR) with fluorouracil (FU) plus mitomycin (MMC) decreased colostomy failure (CF) when compared with induction plus concurrent FU plus cisplatin (CDDP), but did not significantly impact disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) for anal canal carcinoma. The intent of the updated analysis was to determine the long-term impact of treatment on survival (DFS, OS, colostomy-free survival [CFS]), CF, and relapse (locoregional failure [LRF], distant metastasis) in this patient group. Stratification factors included sex, clinical node status, and primary size. DFS and OS were estimated univariately by the Kaplan-Meier method, and treatment arms were compared by log-rank test. Time to relapse and CF were estimated by the cumulative incidence method and treatment arms were compared by using Gray's test. Multivariate analyses used Cox proportional hazard models to test for treatment differences after adjusting for stratification factors. Of 682 patients accrued, 649 were analyzable for outcomes. DFS and OS were statistically better for RT + FU/MMC versus RT + FU/CDDP (5-year DFS, 67.8% v 57.8%; P = .006; 5-year OS, 78.3% v 70.7%; P = .026). There was a trend toward statistical significance for CFS (P = .05), LRF (P = .087), and CF (P = .074). Multivariate analysis was statistically significant for treatment and clinical node status for both DFS and OS, for tumor diameter for DFS, and for sex for OS. CCR with FU/MMC has a statistically significant, clinically meaningful impact on DFS and OS versus induction plus concurrent FU/CDDP, and it has borderline significance for CFS, CF, and LRF. Therefore, RT + FU/MMC remains the preferred standard of care.","Clinical Trial, Phase III",2625.0,247.0,On initial publication of GI Intergroup Radiation Therapy Oncology Group RTOG 98-11 A Phase III Randomized Study of 5-Fluorouracil 5-FU Mitomycin and Radiotherapy Versus 5-Fluorouracil Cisplatin and Radiotherapy in Carcinoma of the Canal concurrent chemoradiation CCR with fluorouracil FU plus mitomycin MMC decreased colostomy failure CF when compared with induction plus concurrent FU plus cisplatin CDDP but did not significantly impact disease-free survival DFS or overall survival OS for canal carcinoma The intent of the updated analysis was to determine the long-term impact of treatment on survival DFS OS colostomy-free survival CFS CF and relapse locoregional failure LRF distant metastasis in this patient group Stratification factors included sex clinical node status and primary size DFS and OS were estimated univariately by the Kaplan-Meier method and treatment arms were compared by log-rank test Time to relapse and CF were estimated by the cumulative incidence method and treatment arms were compared by using Gray 's test Multivariate analyses used Cox proportional hazard models to test for treatment differences after adjusting for stratification factors Of 682 patients accrued 649 were analyzable for outcomes DFS and OS were statistically better for RT FU/MMC versus RT FU/CDDP 5-year DFS 67.8 v 57.8 P .006 5-year OS 78.3 v 70.7 P .026 There was a trend toward statistical significance for CFS P .05 LRF P .087 and CF P .074 Multivariate analysis was statistically significant for treatment and clinical node status for both DFS and OS for tumor diameter for DFS and for sex for OS CCR with FU/MMC has a statistically significant clinically meaningful impact on DFS and OS versus induction plus concurrent FU/CDDP and it has borderline significance for CFS CF and LRF Therefore RT FU/MMC remains the preferred standard of care,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[23, 388, 4397, 1, 2104, 4839, 121, 36, 413, 87, 3931, 1096, 175, 8, 124, 316, 384, 45, 1, 33, 1404, 33, 1296, 5837, 2, 310, 185, 33, 1404, 540, 2, 310, 4, 134, 1, 3, 5614, 750, 975, 4992, 5, 1404, 1296, 349, 5837, 6370, 340, 7635, 496, 5729, 198, 72, 5, 504, 349, 750, 1296, 349, 540, 5820, 84, 205, 44, 97, 345, 34, 115, 25, 1010, 15, 63, 25, 118, 9, 5614, 134, 3, 1697, 1, 3, 2939, 65, 10, 6, 223, 3, 319, 337, 345, 1, 24, 23, 25, 1010, 118, 7635, 115, 25, 12362, 5729, 2, 429, 1325, 496, 6482, 626, 278, 4, 26, 69, 87, 1541, 130, 159, 1035, 38, 289, 156, 2, 86, 444, 1010, 2, 118, 11, 661, 16787, 20, 3, 876, 882, 596, 2, 24, 1335, 11, 72, 20, 1066, 1026, 412, 98, 6, 429, 2, 5729, 11, 661, 20, 3, 967, 287, 596, 2, 24, 1335, 11, 72, 20, 75, 4163, 292, 412, 331, 318, 95, 418, 831, 360, 274, 6, 412, 9, 24, 362, 50, 1358, 9, 1541, 130, 1, 11958, 7, 3198, 13113, 11, 9860, 9, 123, 1010, 2, 118, 11, 712, 380, 9, 240, 1296, 6370, 185, 240, 1296, 5820, 33, 111, 1010, 598, 66, 603, 696, 66, 19, 1861, 33, 111, 118, 833, 27, 603, 431, 67, 19, 4554, 125, 10, 8, 853, 1317, 1050, 724, 9, 12362, 19, 474, 6482, 19, 11545, 2, 5729, 19, 16410, 331, 65, 10, 712, 93, 9, 24, 2, 38, 289, 156, 9, 110, 1010, 2, 118, 9, 30, 2549, 9, 1010, 2, 9, 1035, 9, 118, 4992, 5, 1296, 6370, 71, 8, 712, 93, 505, 2538, 345, 23, 1010, 2, 118, 185, 504, 349, 750, 1296, 5820, 2, 192, 71, 2932, 724, 9, 12362, 5729, 2, 6482, 673, 240, 1296, 6370, 469, 3, 2514, 260, 1, 165]",1851.0,23150707,143
RTOG 0529: a phase 2 evaluation of dose-painted intensity modulated radiation therapy in combination with 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin-C for the reduction of acute morbidity in carcinoma of the anal canal.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-11-12,"A multi-institutional phase 2 trial assessed the utility of dose-painted intensity modulated radiation therapy (DP-IMRT) in reducing grade 2+ combined acute gastrointestinal and genitourinary adverse events (AEs) of 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and mitomycin-C (MMC) chemoradiation for anal cancer by at least 15% compared with the conventional radiation/5FU/MMC arm from RTOG 9811. T2-4N0-3M0 anal cancer patients received 5FU and MMC on days 1 and 29 of DP-IMRT, prescribed per stage: T2N0, 42 Gy elective nodal and 50.4 Gy anal tumor planning target volumes (PTVs) in 28 fractions; T3-4N0-3, 45 Gy elective nodal, 50.4 Gy ≤ 3 cm or 54 Gy >3 cm metastatic nodal and 54 Gy anal tumor PTVs in 30 fractions. The primary endpoint is described above. Planned secondary endpoints assessed all AEs and the investigator's ability to perform DP-IMRT. Of 63 accrued patients, 52 were evaluable. Tumor stage included 54% II, 25% IIIA, and 21% IIIB. In primary endpoint analysis, 77% experienced grade 2+ gastrointestinal/genitourinary acute AEs (9811 77%). There was, however, a significant reduction in acute grade 2+ hematologic, 73% (9811 85%, P=.032), grade 3+ gastrointestinal, 21% (9811 36%, P=.0082), and grade 3+ dermatologic AEs 23% (9811 49%, P<.0001) with DP-IMRT. On initial pretreatment review, 81% required DP-IMRT replanning, and final review revealed only 3 cases with normal tissue major deviations. Although the primary endpoint was not met, DP-IMRT was associated with significant sparing of acute grade 2+ hematologic and grade 3+ dermatologic and gastrointestinal toxicity. Although DP-IMRT proved feasible, the high pretreatment planning revision rate emphasizes the importance of real-time radiation quality assurance for IMRT trials.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",2626.0,270.0,A multi-institutional phase 2 trial assessed the utility of dose-painted intensity modulated radiation therapy DP-IMRT in reducing grade 2+ combined acute and genitourinary adverse events AEs of 5-fluorouracil 5FU and mitomycin-C MMC chemoradiation for cancer by at least 15 compared with the conventional radiation/5FU/MMC arm from RTOG 9811 T2-4N0-3M0 cancer patients received 5FU and MMC on days 1 and 29 of DP-IMRT prescribed per stage T2N0 42 Gy elective nodal and 50.4 Gy tumor planning target volumes PTVs in 28 fractions T3-4N0-3 45 Gy elective nodal 50.4 Gy ≤ 3 cm or 54 Gy 3 cm metastatic nodal and 54 Gy tumor PTVs in 30 fractions The primary endpoint is described above Planned secondary endpoints assessed all AEs and the investigator 's ability to perform DP-IMRT Of 63 accrued patients 52 were evaluable Tumor stage included 54 II 25 IIIA and 21 IIIB In primary endpoint analysis 77 experienced grade 2+ gastrointestinal/genitourinary acute AEs 9811 77 There was however a significant reduction in acute grade 2+ hematologic 73 9811 85 P=.032 grade 3+ 21 9811 36 P=.0082 and grade 3+ dermatologic AEs 23 9811 49 P .0001 with DP-IMRT On initial pretreatment review 81 required DP-IMRT replanning and final review revealed only 3 cases with normal tissue major deviations Although the primary endpoint was not met DP-IMRT was associated with significant sparing of acute grade 2+ hematologic and grade 3+ dermatologic and toxicity Although DP-IMRT proved feasible the high pretreatment planning revision rate emphasizes the importance of real-time radiation quality assurance for IMRT trials,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[8, 1414, 1115, 124, 18, 160, 275, 3, 1207, 1, 61, 21640, 837, 1757, 121, 36, 6107, 964, 4, 1818, 88, 18, 397, 286, 2, 4109, 290, 281, 1477, 1, 33, 1404, 5835, 2, 5837, 256, 6370, 975, 9, 12, 20, 28, 506, 167, 72, 5, 3, 809, 121, 5835, 6370, 475, 29, 3931, 24022, 1786, 18534, 21222, 12, 7, 103, 5835, 2, 6370, 23, 162, 14, 2, 462, 1, 6107, 964, 2746, 379, 82, 11146, 595, 381, 4700, 779, 2, 212, 39, 381, 30, 1349, 283, 2225, 13631, 4, 339, 1550, 2065, 18534, 27, 512, 381, 4700, 779, 212, 39, 381, 1552, 27, 494, 15, 667, 381, 27, 494, 113, 779, 2, 667, 381, 30, 13631, 4, 201, 1550, 3, 86, 1138, 16, 1027, 2090, 1465, 568, 1387, 275, 62, 1477, 2, 3, 3464, 292, 801, 6, 2715, 6107, 964, 1, 676, 3198, 7, 653, 11, 859, 30, 82, 159, 667, 215, 243, 3164, 2, 239, 3036, 4, 86, 1138, 65, 849, 592, 88, 18, 16055, 4109, 286, 1477, 24022, 849, 125, 10, 137, 8, 93, 628, 4, 286, 88, 18, 813, 803, 24022, 772, 19, 4708, 88, 27, 239, 24022, 511, 19, 30795, 2, 88, 27, 4722, 1477, 382, 24022, 739, 19, 488, 5, 6107, 964, 23, 388, 1194, 206, 865, 616, 6107, 964, 16916, 2, 1457, 206, 553, 158, 27, 140, 5, 295, 246, 458, 7810, 242, 3, 86, 1138, 10, 44, 543, 6107, 964, 10, 41, 5, 93, 1851, 1, 286, 88, 18, 813, 2, 88, 27, 4722, 2, 155, 242, 6107, 964, 4328, 1313, 3, 64, 1194, 1349, 5646, 116, 7519, 3, 1187, 1, 1589, 98, 121, 372, 8050, 9, 964, 143]",1604.0,23154075,84
A phase 1 study of gemcitabine combined with dasatinib in patients with advanced solid tumors.,Investigational new drugs,Invest New Drugs,2012-11-20,"Dasatinib has been shown preclinically to overcome resistance to gemcitabine. We evaluated the safety and biological activity of the combination of dasatinib and gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumors. In a phase 1 study (3 + 3 design), patients received daily dasatinib with weekly gemcitabine on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle (except cycle 1 which was 8 weeks). Dose escalation began with dasatinib 70 mg orally (PO) daily and gemcitabine 800 mg/m(2) intravenously (IV) weekly. Forty-seven patients (15 men; median age = 55 years; median number of prior systemic treatments = 4) were enrolled. Dose-limiting toxicities were grade 3 fatigue and dehydration, with the maximum tolerated dose being dasatinib 100 mg PO qd and gemcitabine 600 mg/m(2) IV weekly. The most common grade 3-4 toxicities were anemia (21.5 %), thrombocytopenia (26.2 %), leukopenia (26.2 %), and pleural effusion (10.7 %). Six of 47 patients attained stable disease (SD) ≥ 6 months or partial response including 2 of 8 patients with pancreatic cancer (SD ≥ 6 months; both gemcitabine-refractory), 2 of 3 patients with thymoma (SD for 9.8 and 15 months), 1 of 1 patient with anal squamous cancer (SD 15 months) and 1 of 5 patients with inflammatory breast cancer.

Genomic analysis and selected molecular pathways in rare cancers.,Physical biology,Phys Biol,2012-11-29,"It is widely accepted that many cancers arise as a result of an acquired genomic instability and the subsequent evolution of tumor cells with variable patterns of selected and background aberrations. The presence and behaviors of distinct neoplastic cell populations within a patient's tumor may underlie multiple clinical phenotypes in cancers. A goal of many current cancer genome studies is the identification of recurring selected driver events that can be advanced for the development of personalized therapies. Unfortunately, in the majority of rare tumors, this type of analysis can be particularly challenging. Large series of specimens for analysis are simply not available, allowing recurring patterns to remain hidden. In this paper, we highlight the use of DNA content-based flow sorting to identify and isolate DNA-diploid and DNA-aneuploid populations from tumor biopsies as a strategy to comprehensively study the genomic composition and behaviors of individual cancers in a series of rare solid tumors: intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, anal carcinoma, adrenal leiomyosarcoma, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

Response to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with early age-of-onset rectal cancer.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2013-01-01,"The incidence of rectal cancer in patients ≤ 50 years of age is increasing. The response to neoadjuvant treatment in patients ≤ 50 years of age is not known. Factors affecting the response to neoadjuvant therapy in this age group have not been evaluated. This study aims to evaluate the rate and identify factors that affect pathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with early age-of-onset rectal cancer. This study is a retrospective review. The investigation was conducted at a tertiary-care cancer referral center. Included were 193 consecutive patients ≤ 50 years of age with rectal cancer who underwent neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection. No interventions were performed. The primary outcome measured was the pathologic response to neoadjuvant treatment. The median age was 44 years, and 34% of the patients were female. The median distance from the anal verge was 7 cm. The median percentage of lumen occupied by tumor was 50%. The median CEA level was 3.5 ng/mL. The median treatment response was 80%. The mean number of lymph nodes examined was 15 per patient. Twenty-two percent of patients had a complete or near-complete (≥ 95%) response to neoadjuvant treatment. Seventy-seven percent of evaluable patients experienced tumor or lymph node downstaging on pathologic examination. The presence of adverse histologic features, percentage of lumen occupied by tumor, and CEA level differed between those with <95% response and those with ≥ 95% response to neoadjuvant therapy, although CEA level was not significant when stage IV patients were excluded. This is a retrospective review with heterogeneity in workup, treatment regimens, and interval to surgery. Long-term oncologic outcomes are not available.

Metabolic tumor volume predicts disease progression and survival in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal.,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",J. Nucl. Med.,2012-12-12,"PET imaging has become a useful diagnostic tool in patients with anal cancer. We evaluated the prognostic value of metabolic tumor volume (MTV) in patients with anal cancer treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy. Patients with anal cancer who underwent PET imaging for pretreatment staging or radiation therapy planning from 2003 to 2011 were included. PET parameters included MTV and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). Total MTV (MTV-T) was defined as the sum of the volumes above a standardized uptake value 50% of the SUVmax within the primary tumor and involved nodes. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models were used to test for associations between metabolic or clinical endpoints and overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and event-free survival (EFS). Thirty-nine patients were included. Median follow-up for the cohort was 22 mo. Overall, 6 patients died and 9 patients had disease progression. The 2-y OS, PFS, and EFS for the entire cohort were 88%, 74%, and 69%, respectively. Higher MTV-T was associated with worse OS (P = 0.04), PFS (P = 0.004), and EFS (P = 0.002) on univariate analysis. Patients with an MTV greater than 26 cm(3) had worse PFS than did those with an MTV of 26 cm(3) or less (33% vs. 82%, P = 0.003). SUVmax was not prognostic for any outcome. Higher T classification (T3/T4 vs. T1/T2) was associated with worse PFS and EFS. When adjusting for T classification, MTV-T remained a significant predictor for PFS (P = 0.01) and EFS (P = 0.02).

The role of human papillomavirus in nongenital cancers.,CA: a cancer journal for clinicians,CA Cancer J Clin,2012-12-19,"Human papillomavirus (HPV), one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases worldwide, has an established role in the pathogenesis of genital malignancies such as cervical cancer. The virus has also been implicated in the oncogenesis of nongenital cancers including head and neck malignancies (specifically oropharyngeal cancers) as well as anal cancer. There is less clarity regarding its role in lung and esophageal cancers. Worldwide, the incidence and prevalence of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer has been increasing over time. These patients have improved outcomes compared with those with HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers, and there is continued interest in designing treatments specifically for this HPV-positive subgroup. Clinicians continue to gain an understanding of HPV in anal cancers and the risk factors associated with infection and progression to malignancy.

Anal versus rectal melanoma:  does site of origin predict outcome?,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2013-02-01,"Anatomic site is a predictive factor in subtypes of cutaneous and mucosal melanoma. The aim of this study was to examine the clinical relevance of location of origin of anorectal melanoma as a prognostic factor. With the use of a prospectively maintained database, clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes were compared according to the site of origin. SETTINGS, PATIENTS, INTERVENTIONS: A retrospective review was conducted of patients diagnosed with anorectal melanoma from 1994 to 2010. Tumors were defined as anal, anorectal, or rectal melanoma according to their anatomic relationship to the dentate line. Clinicopathologic factors were compared by χ2 test. Time-to-event analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Of the 96 patients included (41 with anal melanoma, 32 with anorectal melanoma, 23 with rectal melanoma), patients with rectal and anorectal mucosal melanoma had advanced primary tumors (median Breslow thickness, 12 mm and 8 mm, p = 0.002), whereas anal lesions could be found at earlier depths (median thickness, 6.5 mm). Patients with anal tumors more commonly underwent transanal excision (p < 0.02) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (p = 0.004) versus anorectal and rectal tumors. Patterns of recurrence were also distinct; nearly two-thirds of anorectal and rectal tumors recurred systemically, whereas anal melanoma more often recurred within the lymph nodes first (63%; p < 0.02). Recurrence occurred in 24 (59%) patients with anal tumors, 23 (72%) patients with anorectal tumors, and 16 (70%) patients with rectal tumors. Median overall survival was 22 months for anal melanoma, 28 months for anorectal melanoma, and 27 months for rectal melanoma. Recurrence and survival were not statistically different between the groups. This study is limited by small sample size and its retrospective nature. This study represents the only series describing the outcomes of anorectal melanoma by anatomic location. Lesions at or proximal to the dentate line present with more advanced disease, possibly related to a delay in diagnosis. Lesions distal to the dentate line more commonly recur within lymph nodes, which may represent differences in nodal drainage.

We determined locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), distant metastases-free survival (DMFS), and overall survival (OS) for each radiation modality. A propensity score analysis was performed using potentially confounding variables. Locoregional and distant patterns of failure for CRT and IMRT were compared. Patients treated with IMRT had significantly higher N stage (P<.01), and were less likely to be treated with induction chemotherapy (P=.01). The 2-year LRFS, DMFS, and OS were 87%, 86%, and 93%, respectively, for IMRT; and 82%, 88%, 90%, respectively, for CRT; with no significant difference in outcomes by univariate analysis or in a propensity score analysis adjusted for disparity between the groups. This large, single-institution experience of definitive chemoradiation for ASCC using CRT vs. IMRT demonstrates that outcomes are not compromised by more conformal radiotherapy. In the absence of prospective, multi-institutional, randomized trials of IMRT in ASCC, these retrospective data, using methods to minimize bias, can help to establish the role of IMRT in the definitive therapy of ASCC.",Comparative Study,2439.0,30.0,Definitive chemoradiation is the standard management for squamous cell carcinoma ASCC more conformal pelvic radiotherapy using intensity modulated radiotherapy IMRT minimizes toxicity but may increase locoregional recurrences LRR We compared IMRT and conventional radiotherapy CRT outcomes in ASCC patients We retrospectively reviewed records of 223 ASCC patients treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from 1991 to 2010 Forty-five patients received IMRT and 178 CRT We determined locoregional recurrence-free survival LRFS distant metastases-free survival DMFS and overall survival OS for each radiation modality A propensity score analysis was performed using potentially confounding variables Locoregional and distant patterns of failure for CRT and IMRT were compared Patients treated with IMRT had significantly higher N stage P .01 and were less likely to be treated with induction chemotherapy P=.01 The 2-year LRFS DMFS and OS were 87 86 and 93 respectively for IMRT and 82 88 90 respectively for CRT with no significant difference in outcomes by univariate analysis or in a propensity score analysis adjusted for disparity between the groups This large single-institution experience of definitive chemoradiation for ASCC using CRT vs. IMRT demonstrates that outcomes are not compromised by more conformal radiotherapy In the absence of prospective multi-institutional randomized trials of IMRT in ASCC these retrospective data using methods to minimize bias can help to establish the role of IMRT in the definitive therapy of ASCC,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1057, 975, 16, 3, 260, 284, 9, 691, 31, 134, 13205, 80, 2972, 1110, 310, 75, 837, 1757, 310, 964, 14527, 155, 84, 68, 344, 1325, 1593, 2236, 21, 72, 964, 2, 809, 310, 1089, 123, 4, 13205, 7, 21, 894, 446, 1064, 1, 3907, 13205, 7, 73, 28, 2563, 2783, 2784, 12, 574, 29, 3372, 6, 1120, 1213, 365, 7, 103, 964, 2, 7046, 1089, 21, 509, 1325, 146, 115, 25, 6768, 626, 196, 115, 25, 5930, 2, 63, 25, 118, 9, 296, 121, 1396, 8, 1925, 368, 65, 10, 173, 75, 751, 4339, 682, 1325, 2, 626, 764, 1, 496, 9, 1089, 2, 964, 11, 72, 7, 73, 5, 964, 42, 97, 142, 78, 82, 19, 355, 2, 11, 299, 322, 6, 40, 73, 5, 504, 56, 19, 355, 3, 18, 111, 6768, 5930, 2, 118, 11, 912, 868, 2, 966, 106, 9, 964, 2, 878, 889, 424, 106, 9, 1089, 5, 77, 93, 523, 4, 123, 20, 880, 65, 15, 4, 8, 1925, 368, 65, 586, 9, 4326, 59, 3, 271, 26, 375, 226, 731, 730, 1, 1057, 975, 9, 13205, 75, 1089, 105, 964, 1902, 17, 123, 32, 44, 4867, 20, 80, 2972, 310, 4, 3, 1127, 1, 482, 1414, 1115, 384, 143, 1, 964, 4, 13205, 46, 459, 74, 75, 636, 6, 3241, 2947, 122, 987, 6, 1811, 3, 200, 1, 964, 4, 3, 1057, 36, 1, 13205]",1550.0,23692961,3
Evolving role of neoadjuvant therapy in rectal cancer.,Current treatment options in oncology,Curr Treat Options Oncol,2013-09-01,"Management of locally advanced rectal cancer is complex because curative treatment routinely involves administration of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Optimal treatment delivery sequencing and timing are challenging, and moreover, there is considerable heterogeneity in risk based on rectal tumor location, extent, and nodal involvement. The goal in rectal cancer treatment is to optimize disease-free and overall survival while minimizing the risk of local recurrence and toxicity from both radiation and systemic therapy. Currently, the standard approach to management of locally advanced (T3 or T2) rectal cancer involves careful staging with a pelvic MRI and proctoscopic evaluation by a surgeon experienced in total mesorectal excision. MRI can help to distinguish between patients in low-, intermediate-, and high-risk categories. Low-risk tumors have no evidence of either extramural spread or nodal involvement and proximal location in the rectum. For such patients, R0 resection is almost always possible and immediate surgery often is reasonable. In the minority of cases where unanticipated lymph node involvement is detected at surgical pathology, postoperative radiation can be administered. Patients who opt for up-front rectal surgery need to understand that although there is a chance that radiation can be avoided, if it is necessary, it is less well tolerated when administered postoperatively. Initial surgical treatment should be reserved for low-risk patients for whom imaging indicates and multidisciplinary team members feel is able to undergo an R0 resection with low chance for regional spread of disease. For patients with high-risk disease based on distal tumor location requiring an APR, threatened radial margins, or T4 tumors, preoperative chemoradiation is essential. Indeed, this approach increases the likelihood of complete surgical resection with negative margins. For some high-risk patients, for example those with T4 or bulky nodal disease, preoperative systemic therapy followed by preoperative chemoradiation and then surgery may be optimal. The feasibility of this approach is well established based on nonrandomized trials, but it has not been evaluated in a randomized study. Preoperative administration of systemic therapy can achieve clinical downstaging, optimize rates of sphincter preservation, and establish tumor responsiveness, which may be valuable for incorporation into future treatment decisions. For patients with intermediate-risk T3 rectal cancers, for example, a cT3N1 tumor 7 cm from the anal verge with two to three regional lymph nodes in the 7-mm range, we encourage participation in the PROSPECT randomized trial, which is now open and accruing at numerous centers in North America, and shortly in Europe and South America as well. This study will determine in the era of optimal imaging, surgical technique, and better systemic chemotherapy, whether pelvic radiation remains an essential component of curative treatment. The PROSPECT study uses chemoradiation selectively rather than automatically and customizes subsequent treatment based on response to neoadjuvant FOLFOX. Clinical trials with interventions that tailor treatment to more precisely defined clinical subgroups based on both initial features and tumor responsiveness are expected to become the norm. Although this trend is likely to make clinical trial design more complex, customized treatment strategies are likely to achieve the optimal balance between under- and overtreatment and will address the heterogeneity of both tumor biology and disease presentation. For now, treatment for a patient with clinical T3N1 tumor in the mid rectum consists of the following components: ·Neoadjvuant chemoradiation with either 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine as sensitizing therapy. ·Low anterior resection with total mesorectal excision. Typically a temporary diverting ostomy is required. ·Postoperative administration of adjuvant systemic therapy, 8 cycles of FOLFOX is appropriate, although oxaliplatin should be omitted for early signs of peripheral neuropathy or on the basis of age/comorbidity. Although this is the current care standard, there is concern that such extensive treatment is not necessary for all patients to prevent local recurrence and to optimize cure. To determine if therapy can be streamlined, participation in PROSPECT or other clinical trials asking compelling clinical questions is a priority.",Journal Article,2333.0,26.0,Management of locally

"Anal carcinoma: impact of TN category of disease on survival, disease relapse, and colostomy failure in US Gastrointestinal Intergroup RTOG 98-11 phase 3 trial.","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2013-09-10,"The long-term update of US GI Intergroup RTOG 98-11 anal cancer trial found that concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) with fluorouracil (5-FU) plus mitomycin had a significant impact on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with induction plus concurrent 5-FU plus cisplatin. The intent of the current analysis was to determine the impact of tumor node (TN) category of disease on survival (DFS and OS), colostomy failure (CF), and relapse (local-regional failure [LRF] and distant metastases [DM]) in this patient group. DFS and OS were estimated univariately by using the Kaplan-Meier method, and 6 TN categories were compared by the log-rank test (T2N0, T3N0, T4N0, T2N1-3, T3N1-3, and T4N1-3). Time to relapse and colostomy were estimated by the cumulative incidence method, and TN categories were compared using Gray's test. Of 682 patients, 620 were analyzable for outcomes by TN category. All endpoints showed statistically significant differences among the TN categories of disease (OS, P<.0001; DFS, P<.0001; LRF, P<.0001; DM, P=.0011; CF, P=.01). Patients with the poorest OS, DFS, and LRF outcomes were those with T3-4N-positive (+) disease.

Long-term results of weekly/daily cisplatin-based chemoradiation for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal.,Cancer,Cancer,2013-08-20,"Weekly or daily cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemoradiation was evaluated for patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the anal canal treated at a single institution over a 20-year period. A retrospective, single-institution analysis was conducted of patients receiving concurrent 5-FU/cisplatin and radiotherapy for locally advanced SCC from 1989 to 2009. Endpoints included clinical complete response rate, local recurrence rate, colostomy-free survival, disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival, and treatment-related toxicity. A total of 197 patients were evaluable. The majority had American Joint Committee on Cancer stage II (41%) or stage III (46%) disease; most were T2 (44%) or T3 (27%); bulky nodal disease (N2-N3) was noted in 24% of patients. Patients received weekly (20 mg/m2) or daily (4 mg/m2) cisplatin during radiotherapy. Median radiation dose was 55 Gy. Clinical complete response was observed in 185 patients (94%). After a median follow-up of 8.6 years, local recurrence rate was 11%. Sixteen patients (8%) developed distant metastases. The 5-year DFS was 81%, the 5-year overall survival was 86%, and the 5-year colostomy-free survival was 88%. By univariate analysis, N-stage was a poor prognostic indicator for 5-year DFS (P = .02, 95% confidence interval = 1.17-2.01) and distant metastases (P = .046, 95% confidence interval = 1.09-2.13). Increased T-stage correlated with the necessity for salvage surgery (P = .01).

John Cunningham virus T-antigen expression in anal carcinoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-12-14,"Anal carcinoma is thought to be driven by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection through interrupting function of cell regulatory proteins such as p53 and pRb. John Cunningham virus (JCV) expresses a T-antigen that causes malignant transformation through development of aneuploidy and interaction with some of the same regulatory proteins as HPV. JCV T-antigen is present in brain, gastric, and colon malignancies, but has not been evaluated in anal cancers. The authors examined a cohort of anal cancers for JCV T-antigen and correlated this with clinicopathologic data. Archived anal carcinomas were analyzed for JCV T-antigen expression. DNA from tumor and normal tissue was sequenced for JCV with viral copies determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Southern blotting. HPV and microsatellite instability (MSI) status was correlated with JCV T-antigen expression. Of 21 cases of anal cancer (mean age 49 years, 38% female), 12 (57%) were in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals. All 21 cancers expressed JCV T-antigen, including 9 HPV-negative specimens. More JCV copies were present in cancer versus surrounding normal tissue (mean 32.54 copies/μg DNA vs 2.98 copies/μg DNA, P = .0267). There was no correlation between disease stage and viral copies, nor between viral copies and HIV-positive or -negative status (28.7 vs 36.34 copies/μg DNA, respectively, P = .7804). In subset analysis, no association was found between JCV T-antigen expression and HPV or MSI status. Anal carcinomas uniformly express JCV T-antigen and contain more viral copies compared with surrounding normal tissue. JCV and its T-antigen oncogenic protein, presumably through interruption of cell regulatory proteins, may play a role in anal cancer pathogenesis.",Journal Article,3325.0,16.0,carcinoma is thought to be driven by human papillomavirus HPV infection through interrupting function of cell regulatory proteins such as p53 and pRb John Cunningham virus JCV expresses a T-antigen that causes malignant transformation through development of aneuploidy and interaction with some of the same regulatory proteins as HPV JCV T-antigen is present in brain and malignancies but has not been evaluated in cancers The authors examined a cohort of cancers for JCV T-antigen and correlated this with clinicopathologic data Archived carcinomas were analyzed for JCV T-antigen expression DNA from tumor and normal tissue was sequenced for JCV with viral copies determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Southern blotting HPV and microsatellite instability MSI status was correlated with JCV T-antigen expression Of 21 cases of cancer mean age 49 years 38 female 12 57 were in human immunodeficiency virus HIV -positive individuals All 21 cancers expressed JCV T-antigen including 9 HPV-negative specimens More JCV copies were present in cancer versus surrounding normal tissue mean 32.54 copies/μg DNA vs 2.98 copies/μg DNA P .0267 There was no correlation between disease stage and viral copies nor between viral copies and HIV-positive or -negative status 28.7 vs 36.34 copies/μg DNA respectively P .7804 In subset analysis no association was found between JCV T-antigen expression and HPV or MSI status carcinomas uniformly express JCV T-antigen and contain more viral copies compared with surrounding normal tissue JCV and its T-antigen oncogenic protein presumably through interruption of cell regulatory proteins may play a role in cancer pathogenesis,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[134, 16, 2739, 6, 40, 1621, 20, 171, 3242, 933, 930, 298, 17164, 343, 1, 31, 1253, 652, 225, 22, 624, 2, 8734, 9968, 34742, 1450, 7563, 8293, 8, 102, 448, 17, 1626, 393, 1392, 298, 193, 1, 7437, 2, 915, 5, 476, 1, 3, 827, 1253, 652, 22, 933, 7563, 102, 448, 16, 364, 4, 342, 2, 441, 84, 71, 44, 85, 194, 4, 163, 3, 738, 409, 8, 180, 1, 163, 9, 7563, 102, 448, 2, 438, 26, 5, 1399, 74, 6282, 826, 11, 311, 9, 7563, 102, 448, 55, 261, 29, 30, 2, 295, 246, 10, 4040, 9, 7563, 5, 1667, 5127, 509, 20, 1156, 1451, 1260, 1329, 2, 7525, 3661, 933, 2, 2226, 1753, 1494, 156, 10, 438, 5, 7563, 102, 448, 55, 1, 239, 140, 1, 12, 313, 89, 739, 60, 519, 1061, 133, 696, 11, 4, 171, 5323, 1450, 1942, 109, 869, 62, 239, 163, 570, 7563, 102, 448, 141, 83, 933, 199, 623, 80, 7563, 5127, 11, 364, 4, 12, 185, 2976, 295, 246, 313, 531, 667, 5127, 3802, 261, 105, 18, 1096, 5127, 3802, 261, 19, 30433, 125, 10, 77, 816, 59, 34, 82, 2, 1667, 5127, 2110, 59, 1667, 5127, 2, 1942, 109, 15, 199, 156, 339, 67, 105, 511, 562, 5127, 3802, 261, 106, 19, 63396, 4, 697, 65, 77, 248, 10, 204, 59, 7563, 102, 448, 55, 2, 933, 15, 1494, 156, 826, 4254, 1669, 7563, 102, 448, 2, 3725, 80, 1667, 5127, 72, 5, 2976, 295, 246, 7563, 2, 211, 102, 448, 1302, 178, 8682, 298, 4823, 1, 31, 1253, 652, 68, 1343, 8, 200, 4, 12, 1384]",1677.0,24048785,140
Impact of ileostomy-related complications on the multidisciplinary treatment of rectal cancer.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2013-10-02,"Radical resection is the primary treatment for rectal cancer. When anastomosis is possible, a temporary ileostomy is used to decrease morbidity from a poorly healed anastomosis. However, ileostomies are associated with complications, dehydration, and need for a second operation. We sought to evaluate the impact of ileostomy-related complications on the treatment of rectal cancer. We conducted a retrospective study of patients who underwent sphincter-preserving surgery between January 2005 and December 2010 at a tertiary cancer center. The primary outcome was the overall rate of ileostomy-related complications. Secondary outcomes included complications related to ileostomy status, ileostomy closure, anastomotic complications at primary resection, rate of stoma closure, and completion of adjuvant chemotherapy assessed by multivariate logistic regression. Of 294 patients analyzed, 32% (n = 95) were women. Two hundred seventy-one (92%) received neoadjuvant chemoradiation. The median tumor distance from the anal verge was 7 cm (interquartile range 5-10 cm). Two hundred eighty-one (96%) underwent stoma closure at a median of 7 months (interquartile range 5.4-8.3 months). The most common complication related to readmission was dehydration (n = 32-11%).

Metformin use and improved response to therapy in rectal cancer.,Cancer medicine,Cancer Med,2013-02-03,"Locally advanced rectal cancer is commonly treated with chemoradiation prior to total mesorectal excision (TME). Studies suggest that metformin may be an effective chemopreventive agent in this disease as well as a possible adjunct to current therapy. In this study, we examined the effect of metformin use on pathologic complete response (pCR) rates and outcomes in rectal cancer. The charts of 482 patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma treated from 1996 to 2009 with chemoradiation and TME were reviewed. Median radiation dose was 50.4 Gy (range 19.8-63). Nearly, all patients were treated with concurrent 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (98%) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (81.3%). Patients were categorized as nondiabetic (422), diabetic not taking metformin (40), or diabetic taking metformin (20). No significant differences between groups were found in clinical tumor classification, nodal classification, tumor distance from the anal verge or circumferential extent, pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen level, or pathologic differentiation. pCR rates were 16.6% for nondiabetics, 7.5% for diabetics not using metformin, and 35% for diabetics taking metformin, with metformin users having significantly higher pCR rates than either nondiabetics (P = 0.03) or diabetics not using metformin (P = 0.007). Metformin use was significantly associated with pCR rate on univariate (P = 0.05) and multivariate (P = 0.01) analyses. Furthermore, patients taking metformin had significantly increased disease-free (P = 0.013) and overall survival (P = 0.008) compared with other diabetic patients.

Impact of chemotherapy on normal tissue complication probability models of acute hematologic toxicity in patients receiving pelvic intensity modulated radiation therapy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2013-10-22,"To determine how chemotherapy agents affect radiation dose parameters that correlate with acute hematologic toxicity (HT) in patients treated with pelvic intensity modulated radiation therapy (P-IMRT) and concurrent chemotherapy. We assessed HT in 141 patients who received P-IMRT for anal, gynecologic, rectal, or prostate cancers, 95 of whom received concurrent chemotherapy. Patients were separated into 4 groups: mitomycin (MMC) + 5-fluorouracil (5FU, 37 of 141), platinum ± 5FU (Cis, 32 of 141), 5FU (26 of 141), and P-IMRT alone (46 of 141). The pelvic bone was contoured as a surrogate for pelvic bone marrow (PBM) and divided into subsites: ilium, lower pelvis, and lumbosacral spine (LSS). The volumes of each region receiving 5-40 Gy were calculated. The endpoint for HT was grade ≥3 (HT3+) leukopenia, neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Normal tissue complication probability was calculated using the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman model. Logistic regression was used to analyze association between HT3+ and dosimetric parameters. Twenty-six patients experienced HT3+: 10 of 37 (27%) MMC, 14 of 32 (44%) Cis, 2 of 26 (8%) 5FU, and 0 of 46 P-IMRT. PBM dosimetric parameters were correlated with HT3+ in the MMC group but not in the Cis group. LSS dosimetric parameters were well correlated with HT3+ in both the MMC and Cis groups. Constrained optimization (0<n≤ 1) of the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman model resulted in n=1, m = 0.11, TD50 = 31 Gy for LSS in the MMC group and n=1, m = 0.27, TD50 = 35 Gy for LSS in the Cis group. The incidence of HT3+ depends on type of chemotherapy received. Patients receiving P-IMRT ± 5FU have better bone marrow tolerance than those receiving irradiation concurrent with either Cis or MMC. Treatment with MMC has a lower TD50 and more steeply rising normal tissue complication probability curve compared with treatment with Cis. Dose tolerance of PBM and the LSS subsite may be lower for patients treated with MMC compared with Cis.",Journal Article,2282.0,28.0,To determine how chemotherapy agents affect radiation dose parameters that correlate with acute hematologic toxicity HT in patients treated with pelvic intensity modulated radiation therapy P-IMRT and concurrent chemotherapy We assessed HT in 141 patients who received P-IMRT for gynecologic or cancers 95 of whom received concurrent chemotherapy Patients were separated into 4 groups mitomycin MMC 5-fluorouracil 5FU 37 of 141 platinum ± 5FU Cis 32 of 141 5FU 26 of 141 and P-IMRT alone 46 of 141 The pelvic was contoured as a surrogate for pelvic marrow PBM and divided into subsites ilium lower pelvis and lumbosacral spine LSS The volumes of each region receiving 5-40 Gy were calculated The endpoint for HT was grade ≥3 HT3+ leukopenia neutropenia or thrombocytopenia Normal tissue complication probability was calculated using the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman model Logistic regression was used to analyze association between HT3+ and dosimetric parameters Twenty-six patients experienced HT3+ 10 of 37 27 MMC 14 of 32 44 Cis 2 of 26 8 5FU and 0 of 46 P-IMRT PBM dosimetric parameters were correlated with HT3+ in the MMC group but not in the Cis group LSS dosimetric parameters were well correlated with HT3+ in both the MMC and Cis groups Constrained optimization 0 n≤ 1 of the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman model resulted in n=1 m 0.11 TD50 31 Gy for LSS in the MMC group and n=1 m 0.27 TD50 35 Gy for LSS in the Cis group The incidence of HT3+ depends on type of chemotherapy received Patients receiving P-IMRT ± 5FU have better marrow tolerance than those receiving irradiation concurrent with either Cis or MMC Treatment with MMC has a lower TD50 and more steeply rising normal tissue complication probability curve compared with treatment with Cis Dose tolerance of PBM and the LSS subsite may be lower for patients treated with MMC compared with Cis,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[6, 223, 832, 56, 183, 1158, 121, 61, 1038, 17, 1513, 5, 286, 813, 155, 3152, 4, 7, 73, 5, 1110, 837, 1757, 121, 36, 19, 964, 2, 750, 56, 21, 275, 3152, 4, 4379, 7, 54, 103, 19, 964, 9, 1512, 15, 163, 48, 1, 953, 103, 750, 56, 7, 11, 4910, 237, 39, 271, 5837, 6370, 33, 1404, 5835, 567, 1, 4379, 828, 810, 5835, 1927, 531, 1, 4379, 5835, 432, 1, 4379, 2, 19, 964, 279, 641, 1, 4379, 3, 1110, 10, 6476, 22, 8, 2592, 9, 1110, 581, 9215, 2, 2176, 237, 11239, 18295, 280, 3270, 2, 15598, 2342, 11184, 3, 2225, 1, 296, 1053, 357, 33, 327, 381, 11, 981, 3, 1138, 9, 3152, 10, 88, 2608, 10611, 3904, 778, 15, 1340, 295, 246, 1447, 1320, 10, 981, 75, 3, 27159, 27160, 27161, 202, 812, 320, 10, 95, 6, 1992, 248, 59, 10611, 2, 3187, 1038, 737, 437, 7, 592, 10611, 79, 1, 567, 428, 6370, 213, 1, 531, 584, 1927, 18, 1, 432, 66, 5835, 2, 13, 1, 641, 19, 964, 9215, 3187, 1038, 11, 438, 5, 10611, 4, 3, 6370, 87, 84, 44, 4, 3, 1927, 87, 11184, 3187, 1038, 11, 149, 438, 5, 10611, 4, 110, 3, 6370, 2, 1927, 271, 9133, 3980, 13, 63552, 14, 1, 3, 27159, 27160, 27161, 202, 627, 4, 78, 14, 188, 13, 175, 35693, 456, 381, 9, 11184, 4, 3, 6370, 87, 2, 78, 14, 188, 13, 428, 35693, 465, 381, 9, 11184, 4, 3, 1927, 87, 3, 287, 1, 10611, 3828, 23, 267, 1, 56, 103, 7, 357, 19, 964, 810, 5835, 47, 380, 581, 2614, 76, 135, 357, 1104, 750, 5, 361, 1927, 15, 6370, 24, 5, 6370, 71, 8, 280, 35693, 2, 80, 40520, 3699, 295, 246, 1447, 1320, 1496, 72, 5, 24, 5, 1927, 61, 2614, 1, 9215, 2, 3, 11184, 9483, 68, 40, 280, 9, 7, 73, 5, 6370, 72, 5, 1927]",1846.0,24161422,126
"Preoperative radiation therapy with concurrent capecitabine, bevacizumab, and erlotinib for rectal cancer: a phase 1 trial.","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2013-12-05,"The goal of this phase 1 trial was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of concurrent capecitabine, bevacizumab, and erlotinib with preoperative radiation therapy for rectal cancer. Patients with clinical stage II to III rectal adenocarcinoma, within 12 cm from the anal verge, were treated in 4 escalating dose levels, using the continual reassessment method. Patients received preoperative radiation therapy with concurrent bevacizumab (5 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks), erlotinib, and capecitabine. Capecitabine dose was increased from 650 mg/m(2) to 825 mg/m(2) orally twice daily on the days of radiation therapy; erlotinib dose was increased from 50 mg orally daily in weeks 1 to 3, to 50 mg daily in weeks 1 to 6, to 100 mg daily in weeks 1 to 6. Patients underwent surgery at least 9 weeks after the last dose of bevacizumab. A total of 19 patients were enrolled, and 18 patients were considered evaluable. No patient had grade 4 acute toxicity, and 1 patient had grade 3 acute toxicity (hypertension). The MTD was not reached. All 18 evaluable patients underwent surgery, with low anterior resection in 7 (39%), proctectomy with coloanal anastomosis in 4 patients (22%), posterior pelvic exenteration in 1 (6%), and abdominoperineal resection in 6 (33%). Of the 18 patients, 8 (44%) had pathologic complete response, and 1 had complete response of the primary tumor with positive nodes. Three patients (17%) had grade 3 postoperative complications (ileus, small bowel obstruction, and infection).

Data on disease control and toxicity were collected as well as patient and treatment characteristics. Acute (<6 mo) and late (≥6 mo) severe toxicity (grade ≥3) were graded. Four patients were excluded due to the presence of metastatic disease or stage TX. Late toxicity data were available for 120 patients. Median cumulative IMRT dose was 51.25 Gy (median, 28 fractions). All but 2 patients received chemotherapy. With median follow-up of 26.8 months, local control at 3 years was 87%, worse for patients with T3-T4 than T1-T2 disease on univariate analysis (79% vs. 90%; P=0.04). Regional control, distant control, and overall survival were 97%, 91%, and 87%, respectively, at 3 years. Nodal status was associated with regional control, distant control, and overall survival (P<0.01 for each). Most common severe acute toxicity was hematologic (41%), skin (20%), and gastrointestinal tract (11%). Two grade 5 toxicities occurred (hematologic and gastrointestinal tract). Severe late toxicity affected skin (1%) and gastrointestinal tract (3%). IMRT with chemotherapy resulted in excellent local control.

Neoadjuvant radiotherapy use in locally advanced rectal cancer at NCCN member institutions.,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,2014-02-01,"Based on randomized data, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has been incorporated into the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for stage II-III rectal cancer. Factors associated with nonadherence to evidence-based guidelines for neoadjuvant radiotherapy (RT) were examined at dedicated cancer centers. The prospective NCCN Oncology Outcomes Database for Colorectal Cancers was queried for patients with stage II-III rectal cancer who underwent a transabdominal surgical resection between September 2005 and June 2012. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with omission of RT. Among 1199 identified patients, 1119 (93%) received neoadjuvant RT, 51 (4%) did not receive RT, and 29 (2%) received adjuvant RT. Among 51 patients not receiving RT, only 19 (37%) were referred and evaluated by a radiation oncologist. On multivariable analysis, clinical factors associated with not receiving RT included a history of prior pelvic RT (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 23.9; P=.0003), ECOG performance status of 2 or greater (aOR, 11.1; P=.01), tumor distance from the anal verge greater than 10 cm (aOR, 5.4; P=.009), age at diagnosis of 75 years or older (aOR, 4.43; P=.002), body mass index of 25 to 30 kg/m(2) and less than 25 kg/m(2) (aOR, 5.22 and 4.23, respectively; P=.03), and clinical stage II (aOR, 2.27; P=.02). No significant change was seen in RT use according to diagnosis year, nor was any correlation seen with distance to the nearest RT facility. Concordance with NCCN Guidelines for neoadjuvant RT is high among NCCN Member Institutions. After adjusting for clinical characteristics that increase the risk for RT toxicity, including history of pelvic RT and high comorbidity burden/low functional status, the authors found that non-obese patients of advanced age or those with more favorable clinical features were more likely to not receive RT.

Multimodality therapy including salvage surgical resection and intraoperative radiotherapy for patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the anus with residual or recurrent disease after primary chemoradiotherapy.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2014-04-01,"For patients with residual or recurrent squamous-cell carcinoma of the anus after primary chemoradiotherapy, the standard treatment is surgical salvage. Patients with unresectable or borderline unresectable disease have poor outcomes, thus adjunctive treatments should be explored. The aim of this study is to report outcomes for patients with residual/recurrent anal cancer treated with multimodality therapy including salvage surgical resection and intraoperative radiotherapy. This is an observational study. This study was conducted at a tertiary referral center. Thirty-two patients were treated between 1993 and 2012. Median age was 53 years (range, 34-87). Salvage treatment was performed for residual disease (n = 9), first recurrence (n = 17), or second recurrence (n = 6) after primary chemoradiotherapy. Patients with recurrent disease received preoperative external beam reirradiation with concurrent chemotherapy. All patients underwent salvage surgical resection and intraoperative radiotherapy. Extent of surgical resection was R0 (negative margins, n = 16), R1 (microscopic residual, n = 13), or R2 (macroscopic residual, n = 3). The median intraoperative radiotherapy dose was 12.5 Gy. Treatment-related adverse events were classified according to the National Cancer Institute - Common Toxicity Criteria. Overall and disease-free survival were estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier technique. Central, local-regional, and distant failure were estimated by the use of the cumulative incidence method. Median length of hospital stay was 9 days. Mortality at 30 days after surgery and intraoperative radiotherapy was 0%. Fifteen patients (47%) experienced a total of 16 grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (wound complication (n = 6), bowel obstruction (n = 5), and ureteral obstruction (n = 3)).

Cost-effectiveness analysis of intensity modulated radiation therapy versus 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy for anal cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2014-04-09,"To compare the cost-effectiveness of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) for anal cancer and determine disease, patient, and treatment parameters that influence the result. A Markov decision model was designed with the various disease states for the base case of a 65-year-old patient with anal cancer treated with either IMRT or 3D-CRT and concurrent chemotherapy. Health states accounting for rates of local failure, colostomy failure, treatment breaks, patient prognosis, acute and late toxicities, and the utility of toxicities were informed by existing literature and analyzed with deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. In the base case, mean costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy in years (QALY) for IMRT and 3D-CRT were $32,291 (4.81) and $28,444 (4.78), respectively, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $128,233/QALY for IMRT compared with 3D-CRT. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that IMRT was cost-effective in 22%, 47%, and 65% of iterations at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000, $100,000, and $150,000 per QALY, respectively. In our base model, IMRT was a cost-ineffective strategy despite the reduced acute treatment toxicities and their associated costs of management.

Lumbosacral spine and marrow cavity modeling of acute hematologic toxicity in patients treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal.,Practical radiation oncology,Pract Radiat Oncol,2013-08-29,"To identify various dosimetric parameters of bone marrow cavity that correlate with acute hematologic toxicity (HT) in patients with anal squamous cell carcinoma treated with definitive chemoradiation therapy (CRT). We analyzed 32 patients receiving CRT. The whole pelvic bone marrow (PBM) and the lumbosacral spine (LSS) subregion were contoured for each patient. Marrow cavities were contoured using the Hounsfield units (HUs) of 100, 150, 200, and 250 as maximum density threshold levels. The volume of each region receiving at least 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 Gy was calculated. The endpoint was grade ≥3 HT (HT3+). Normal-tissue complication probability (NTCP) was evaluated with the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) model. Maximal likelihood estimate was used to compare the parameter set. Logistic regression was used to test associations between HT and both dosimetric and clinical parameters. Ten patients (31%) experienced HT3+. While dose to both LSS and PBM significantly predicted for HT3+, LSS was superior to PBM by logistic regression and LKB modeling. Constrained optimization of the LKB model for HT3+ yielded the parameters m = 0.21, n = 1, and TD50 = 32 Gy for LSS. The NTCP fits were better with the whole bone than with marrow cavity using any HU threshold. Mean LSS doses of 21 Gy and 23.5 Gy result in a 5% and 10% risk of HT3+, respectively. Mean dose and low-dose radiation parameters (V5, V10, V15, V20) of whole bone or bone cavities of LSS were correlated most significantly with HT3+. For predicting the risk of HT3+, whole-bone contours were superior to marrow cavity and LSS was superior to PBM by LKB modeling. The results confirm PBM and LSS as parallel organs when predicting hematologic toxicity. Recommended dose constraints to the LSS are V10 ≤80%. An LSS mean dose of 23.5 Gy is associated with a 10% risk of HT.",Journal Article,2336.0,19.0,To identify various dosimetric parameters of marrow cavity that correlate with acute hematologic toxicity HT in patients with squamous cell carcinoma treated with definitive chemoradiation therapy CRT We analyzed 32 patients receiving CRT The whole pelvic marrow PBM and the lumbosacral spine LSS subregion were contoured for each patient Marrow cavities were contoured using the Hounsfield units HUs of 100 150 200 and 250 as maximum density threshold levels The volume of each region receiving at least 5 10 15 20 30 and 40 Gy was calculated The endpoint was grade ≥3 HT HT3+ Normal-tissue complication probability NTCP was evaluated with the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman LKB model Maximal likelihood estimate was used to compare the parameter set Logistic regression was used to test associations between HT and both dosimetric and clinical parameters Ten patients 31 experienced HT3+ While dose to both LSS and PBM significantly predicted for HT3+ LSS was superior to PBM by logistic regression and LKB modeling Constrained optimization of the LKB model for HT3+ yielded the parameters m 0.21 n 1 and TD50 32 Gy for LSS The NTCP fits were better with the whole than with marrow cavity using any HU threshold Mean LSS doses of 21 Gy and 23.5 Gy result in a 5 and 10 risk of HT3+ respectively Mean dose and low-dose radiation parameters V5 V10 V15 V20 of whole or cavities of LSS were correlated most significantly with HT3+ For predicting the risk of HT3+ whole-bone contours were superior to marrow cavity and LSS was superior to PBM by LKB modeling The results confirm PBM and LSS as parallel organs when predicting hematologic toxicity Recommended dose constraints to the LSS are V10 ≤80 An LSS mean dose of 23.5 Gy is associated with a 10 risk of HT,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 255, 747, 3187, 1038, 1, 581, 2405, 17, 1513, 5, 286, 813, 155, 3152, 4, 7, 5, 691, 31, 134, 73, 5, 1057, 975, 36, 1089, 21, 311, 531, 7, 357, 1089, 3, 902, 1110, 581, 9215, 2, 3, 15598, 2342, 11184, 31914, 11, 6476, 9, 296, 69, 581, 11982, 11, 6476, 75, 3, 16894, 2960, 25140, 1, 394, 1577, 1250, 2, 2039, 22, 689, 1263, 2390, 148, 3, 433, 1, 296, 1053, 357, 28, 506, 33, 79, 167, 179, 201, 2, 327, 381, 10, 981, 3, 1138, 10, 88, 2608, 3152, 10611, 295, 246, 1447, 1320, 13479, 10, 194, 5, 3, 27159, 27160, 27161, 20766, 202, 2725, 1420, 1191, 10, 95, 6, 932, 3, 4219, 916, 812, 320, 10, 95, 6, 412, 685, 59, 3152, 2, 110, 3187, 2, 38, 1038, 1618, 7, 456, 592, 10611, 369, 61, 6, 110, 11184, 2, 9215, 97, 783, 9, 10611, 11184, 10, 1123, 6, 9215, 20, 812, 320, 2, 20766, 2057, 9133, 3980, 1, 3, 20766, 202, 9, 10611, 2178, 3, 1038, 188, 13, 239, 78, 14, 2, 35693, 531, 381, 9, 11184, 3, 13479, 11688, 11, 380, 5, 3, 902, 76, 5, 581, 2405, 75, 500, 5948, 2390, 313, 11184, 415, 1, 239, 381, 2, 382, 33, 381, 757, 4, 8, 33, 2, 79, 43, 1, 10611, 106, 313, 61, 2, 154, 61, 121, 1038, 10234, 10724, 18318, 8120, 1, 902, 15, 11982, 1, 11184, 11, 438, 96, 97, 5, 10611, 9, 1434, 3, 43, 1, 10611, 902, 3417, 6137, 11, 1123, 6, 581, 2405, 2, 11184, 10, 1123, 6, 9215, 20, 20766, 2057, 3, 99, 1843, 9215, 2, 11184, 22, 2755, 2285, 198, 1434, 813, 155, 793, 61, 4879, 6, 3, 11184, 32, 10724, 29561, 35, 11184, 313, 61, 1, 382, 33, 381, 16, 41, 5, 8, 79, 43, 1, 3152]",1748.0,24766688,54

Optimal treatment strategies for anal cancer.,Current treatment options in oncology,Curr Treat Options Oncol,2014-09-01,"Squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) of the anal canal is an underrecognized malignancy that is growing in annual incidence. Over the years, combined chemoradiation has been the mainstay of treatment for locally advanced SCCA of the anal canal. Currently, the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine is recommended to prevent the development of HPV and its associated precancerous lesion(s). Patients diagnosed with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV+) are prone to develop anal cancer due to their high risk of contracting HPV infection.

All but 1 received intensity modulated radiation therapy; median primary tumor dose 50.4 Gy (range, 41.4-60). A modified National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 was used to score VS based on the medical record description of dyspareunia, pain with dilator use, vaginal dryness, or difficult pelvic examination. Ordered logistic regression was performed to assess VS predictors. Median age was 60.4 years (range, 19-97). With median follow-up of 2.5 years, 70 women (74%) had adequate information to assess VS.

Clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccination in HIV-negative men who have sex with men to prevent recurrent high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia.,Vaccine,Vaccine,2014-11-01,"We examined the long-term clinical and economic benefits of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (qHPV) vaccine as a secondary/adjunct prevention strategy in the prevention of recurrent high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGAIN) in HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM) and are 27 years or older. We constructed a Markov model to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two strategies: (1) no qHPV vaccine after treatment for HGAIN versus (2) qHPV vaccine after treatment for HGAIN. Model parameters, including natural history of anal cancer, vaccine efficacy measured in terms of hazard ratio (HR) (decrease in the risk of recurrent HGAIN), HGAIN treatment efficacy, utilities, and costs, were obtained from the literature. The outcomes were measured in terms of lifetime risk of anal cancer, lifetime cost, quality-adjusted life years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Sensitivity analysis was conducted on all model parameters. We found that vaccinating HIV-negative MSM reduced the lifetime risk of anal cancer by 60.77% at an ICER of US$87,240 per quality-adjusted life-year. The results were highly sensitive to vaccine efficacy, transition of HGAIN to anal cancer, cost of treatment for HGAIN, vaccine degree of protection over time, and the vaccine duration of protection and less sensitive to HPV clearance, cost of qHPV vaccine, and the transitions from normal to low-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (LGAIN) and normal to HGAIN. With an HR of 0.3, the ICER was well below a $50,000 willingness-to-pay threshold; with an HR of 0.5, the ICER was still below a threshold of $100,000.

Does endoscopic ultrasound improve detection of locally recurrent anal squamous-cell cancer?,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2015-02-01,"Evaluating patients for recurrent anal cancer after primary treatment can be difficult owing to distorted anatomy and scarring. Many institutions incorporate endoscopic ultrasound to improve detection, but the effectiveness is unknown. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of digital rectal examination and endoscopic ultrasound in detecting locally recurrent disease during routine follow-up of patients with anal cancer. This study is a retrospective, single-institution review. This study was conducted at an oncologic tertiary referral center. Included were 175 patients with nonmetastatic anal squamous-cell cancer, without persistent disease after primary chemoradiotherapy, who had at least 1 posttreatment ultrasound and examination by a colorectal surgeon. The primary outcomes measured were the first modality to detect local recurrence, concordance, crude cancer detection rate, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value. Eight hundred fifty-five endoscopic ultrasounds and 873 digital rectal examinations were performed during 35 months median follow-up. Overall, ultrasound detected 7 (0.8%) mesorectal and 32 (3.7%) anal canal abnormalities; digital examination detected 69 (7.9%) anal canal abnormalities. Locally recurrent disease was found on biopsy in 8 patients, all detected first or only with digital examination. Four patients did not have an ultrasound at the time of diagnosis of recurrence. The concordance of ultrasound and digital examination in detecting recurrent disease was fair at 0.37 (SE, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.21-0.54), and there was no difference in crude cancer detection rate, sensitivity, specificity, and negative or positive predictive values. The heterogeneity of follow-up timing and examinations is not standardized in this study but is reflective of general practice.

Phys.,2015-05-14,"To evaluate the rate of gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity of neoadjuvant chemoradiation with capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in cT3-4 rectal cancer. Patients with localized, nonmetastatic T3 or T4 rectal cancer <12 cm from the anal verge were enrolled in a prospective, multi-institutional, single-arm study of preoperative chemoradiation. Patients received 45 Gy with IMRT in 25 fractions, followed by a 3-dimensional conformal boost of 5.4 Gy in 3 fractions with concurrent capecitabine/oxaliplatin (CAPOX). Surgery was performed 4 to 8 weeks after the completion of therapy. Patients were recommended to receive FOLFOX chemotherapy after surgery. The primary endpoint of the study was acute grade 2 to 5 GI toxicity. Seventy-one patients provided 80% probability to detect at least a 12% reduction in the specified GI toxicity with the treatment of CAPOX and IMRT, at a significance level of .10 (1-sided). Seventy-nine patients were accrued, of whom 68 were evaluable. Sixty-one patients (89.7%) had cT3 disease, and 37 (54.4%) had cN (+) disease. Postoperative chemotherapy was given to 42 of 68 patients. Fifty-eight patients had target contours drawn per protocol, 5 patients with acceptable variation, and 5 patients with unacceptable variations. Thirty-five patients (51.5%) experienced grade ≥ 2 GI toxicity, 12 patients (17.6%) experienced grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, and pCR was achieved in 10 patients (14.7%). With a median follow-up time of 3.98 years, the 4-year rate of locoregional failure was 7.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0%-13.7%).

Surgical Options in the Treatment of Lower Gastrointestinal Tract Cancers.,Current treatment options in oncology,Curr Treat Options Oncol,2015-09-01,"Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the USA with the second highest mortality. Early detection with screening endoscopy, in addition to improvement in treatment modalities lead to higher overall survival rates. Treatment of localized colon cancer comprises of surgical resection with en bloc lymphadenectomy. Adjuvant therapy is determined by final pathologic stage. However, treatment of rectal cancer is more complex and is determined by the clinical pathologic stage. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy is an important component to treatment to decrease the risk of local recurrence. As with colon cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy is dependent on the pathologic stage. Newer technologies are being utilized in both colon and rectal cancer including minimally invasive procedures and sphincter preservation procedures. Anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common histologic subtype of anal canal tumors. Anal SCC is most commonly seen in patients with HPV infections. Prior to the 1970s, anal SCC was treated with abdominoperineal resection and end colostomy. Nigro and colleagues utilized chemoradiation to treat anal SCC with response rates as high as 80%.

Long-Term Outcomes of Adding HPV Vaccine to the Anal Intraepithelial Neoplasia Treatment Regimen in HIV-Positive Men Who Have Sex With Men.,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,Clin. Infect. Dis.,2015-07-29,"Recent evidence shows that quadrivalent human papillomavirus (qHPV) vaccination in men who have sex with men (MSM) who have a history of high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (HGAIN) was associated with a 50% reduction in the risk of recurrent HGAIN. We evaluated the long-term clinical and economic outcomes of adding the qHPV vaccine to the treatment regimen for HGAIN in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive MSM aged ≥27 years. We constructed a Markov model based on anal histology in HIV-positive MSM comparing qHPV vaccination with no vaccination after treatment for HGAIN, the current practice. The model parameters, including baseline prevalence, disease transitions, costs, and utilities, were either obtained from the literature or calibrated using a natural history model of anal carcinogenesis. The model outputs included lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life years, and lifetime risk of developing anal cancer. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of qHPV vaccination compared to no qHPV vaccination and decrease in lifetime risk of anal cancer. We also conducted deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of the results. Use of qHPV vaccination after treatment for HGAIN decreased the lifetime risk of anal cancer by 63% compared with no vaccination. The qHPV vaccination strategy was cost saving; it decreased lifetime costs by $419 and increased quality-adjusted life years by 0.16. Results were robust to the sensitivity analysis.

Clinicopathologic Features Associated With Human Papillomavirus/p16 in Patients With Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Anal Canal.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2015-09-17,"The incidence of anal carcinoma in the U.S. continues to increase steadily, and infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) is an established risk factor for the development of anal carcinoma. However, the clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal according to HPV status have not yet been defined. The records of patients treated for metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal at the MD Anderson Cancer Center from June 2005 to August 2013 were reviewed. The patients were tested for the presence of HPV DNA by in situ hybridization and/or the p16 oncoprotein by immunohistochemistry. Associations between the presence of HPV and clinicopathologic attributes were measured. Of the 72 patients reviewed, 68 tumors (94%) had detectable HPV. Patients with HPV-negative tumors were more likely to be of nonwhite ethnicity (odds ratio, 8.7) and have a strong (>30 pack-year) tobacco history (odds ratio, 8.7). A trend toward improved survival from the time of diagnosis of metastatic disease was noted among patients with HPV-positive tumors. Most patients with metastatic anal cancer had detectable HPV, with differences in tobacco history and ethnicity detected according to HPV status. The high frequency of HPV positivity for patients with metastatic anal cancer has important implications for novel immunotherapy treatment approaches, including ongoing clinical trials with immune checkpoint blockade agents using antibodies targeting the programmed death-1 receptor. Previous studies investigating the clinical features of patients with anal cancer focused on those with early-stage disease. The present study characterizes, for the first time, clinical and pathological features according to human papillomavirus (HPV) status for patients with metastatic anal cancer. A high frequency of HPV-positive tumors and correlations between HPV status and both ethnicity and tobacco history was found. No standard-of-care therapy is available for patients with metastatic anal cancer, and most receive cytotoxic chemotherapy. The high prevalence of HPV in the current population generates optimism for ongoing clinical trials investigating the role of immune checkpoint blockade agents as a novel treatment approach for this disease.",Journal Article,1587.0,17.0,The incidence of carcinoma in the U.S. continues to increase steadily and infection with the human papillomavirus HPV is an established risk factor for the development of carcinoma However the clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the canal according to HPV status have not yet been defined The records of patients treated for metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the canal at the MD Anderson Cancer Center from June 2005 to August 2013 were reviewed The patients were tested for the presence of HPV DNA by in situ hybridization and/or the p16 oncoprotein by immunohistochemistry Associations between the presence of HPV and clinicopathologic attributes were measured Of the 72 patients reviewed 68 tumors 94 had detectable HPV Patients with HPV-negative tumors were more likely to be of nonwhite ethnicity odds ratio 8.7 and have a strong 30 pack-year tobacco history odds ratio 8.7 A trend toward improved survival from the time of diagnosis of metastatic disease was noted among patients with HPV-positive tumors Most patients with metastatic cancer had detectable HPV with differences in tobacco history and ethnicity detected according to HPV status The high frequency of HPV positivity for patients with metastatic cancer has important implications for novel immunotherapy treatment approaches including ongoing clinical trials with immune checkpoint blockade agents using antibodies targeting the programmed death-1 receptor Previous studies investigating the clinical features of patients with cancer focused on those with early-stage disease The present study characterizes for the first time clinical and pathological features according to human papillomavirus HPV status for patients with metastatic cancer A high frequency of HPV-positive tumors and correlations between HPV status and both ethnicity and tobacco history was found No standard-of-care therapy is available for patients with metastatic cancer and most receive cytotoxic chemotherapy The high prevalence of HPV in the current population generates optimism for ongoing clinical trials investigating the role of immune checkpoint blockade agents as a novel treatment approach for this disease,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 287, 1, 134, 4, 3, 1767, 695, 2274, 6, 344, 7025, 2, 930, 5, 3, 171, 3242, 933, 16, 35, 635, 43, 161, 9, 3, 193, 1, 134, 137, 3, 1399, 374, 1, 7, 5, 113, 691, 31, 134, 1, 3, 5614, 768, 6, 933, 156, 47, 44, 1145, 85, 395, 3, 1064, 1, 7, 73, 9, 113, 691, 31, 134, 1, 3, 5614, 28, 3, 2244, 1929, 12, 574, 29, 1924, 1242, 6, 2480, 1346, 11, 446, 3, 7, 11, 650, 9, 3, 463, 1, 933, 261, 20, 4, 957, 1554, 2, 15, 3, 1932, 6159, 20, 888, 685, 59, 3, 463, 1, 933, 2, 1399, 7372, 11, 644, 1, 3, 720, 7, 446, 806, 57, 960, 42, 2083, 933, 7, 5, 933, 199, 57, 11, 80, 322, 6, 40, 1, 8335, 2091, 610, 197, 66, 67, 2, 47, 8, 1082, 201, 4668, 111, 2607, 532, 610, 197, 66, 67, 8, 853, 1317, 231, 25, 29, 3, 98, 1, 147, 1, 113, 34, 10, 1051, 107, 7, 5, 933, 109, 57, 96, 7, 5, 113, 12, 42, 2083, 933, 5, 362, 4, 2607, 532, 2, 2091, 530, 768, 6, 933, 156, 3, 64, 675, 1, 933, 1887, 9, 7, 5, 113, 12, 71, 305, 1268, 9, 229, 726, 24, 611, 141, 942, 38, 143, 5, 250, 986, 1189, 183, 75, 890, 529, 3, 1846, 273, 14, 153, 698, 94, 3103, 3, 38, 404, 1, 7, 5, 12, 1649, 23, 135, 5, 191, 82, 34, 3, 364, 45, 9239, 9, 3, 157, 98, 38, 2, 1301, 404, 768, 6, 171, 3242, 933, 156, 9, 7, 5, 113, 12, 8, 64, 675, 1, 933, 109, 57, 2, 2553, 59, 933, 156, 2, 110, 2091, 2, 2607, 532, 10, 204, 77, 260, 1, 165, 36, 16, 390, 9, 7, 5, 113, 12, 2, 96, 560, 759, 56, 3, 64, 1078, 1, 933, 4, 3, 291, 266, 7919, 8322, 9, 942, 38, 143, 3103, 3, 200, 1, 250, 986, 1189, 183, 22, 8, 229, 24, 353, 9, 26, 34]",2218.0,26382740,148
Comprehensive multiplatform biomarker analysis of 199 anal squamous cell carcinomas.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2015-12-01,"Anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC) is a rare, HPV-associated malignancy typically diagnosed in early stages and definitively treated with chemoradiation. In situations where patients exhibit metastatic or recurrent disease, treatment options are severely limited. In this study, molecular alterations were identified that could be used to aid in therapeutic decisions for patients with metastatic or recurrent anal squamous cell carcinoma. Specimens from patients with this cancer were tested via a multiplatform profiling service (Caris Life Sciences, Phoenix, AZ) consisting of gene sequencing, protein expression by immunohistochemistry, and gene amplification with in situ hybridization. Utilizing these techniques, novel treatment strategies that could be explored were identified, including potential benefit with anti-EGFR therapies, immune checkpoint inhibitors, topoisomerase inhibitors, and taxanes.

For this study, we used Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked database (1992 to 2009). We matched newly diagnosed anal cancer patients (by age and sex) to noncancer controls. We estimated survival time from the date of diagnosis until death. Lifetime and average annual cost by stage and age at diagnosis were estimated by combining survival data with Medicare claims. The average lifetime cost, proportion of patients who were elderly, and the number of incident cases were used to estimate the economic burden. The average lifetime cost for patients with anal cancer was US$50,150 (N=2227) (2014 US dollars). The average annual cost in men and women was US$8025 and US$5124, respectively. The overall survival after the diagnosis of cancer was 8.42 years. As the age and stage at diagnosis increased, so did the cost of cancer-related care.

Anorectal Cancer: Critical Anatomic and Staging Distinctions That Affect Use of Radiation Therapy.,"Radiographics : a review publication of the Radiological Society of North America, Inc",Radiographics,,"Although rectal and anal cancers are anatomically close, they are distinct entities with different histologic features, risk factors, staging systems, and treatment pathways. Imaging is at the core of initial clinical staging of these cancers and most commonly includes magnetic resonance imaging for local-regional staging and computed tomography for evaluation of metastatic disease. The details of the primary tumor and involvement of regional lymph nodes are crucial in determining if and how radiation therapy should be used in treatment of these cancers. Unfortunately, available imaging modalities have been shown to have imperfect accuracy for identification of nodal metastases and imaging features other than size. Staging of nonmetastatic rectal cancers is dependent on the depth of invasion (T stage) and the number of involved regional lymph nodes (N stage). Staging of nonmetastatic anal cancers is determined according to the size of the primary mass and the combination of regional nodal sites involved; the number of positive nodes at each site is not a consideration for staging. Patients with T3 rectal tumors and/or involvement of perirectal, mesenteric, and internal iliac lymph nodes receive radiation therapy. Almost all anal cancers warrant use of radiation therapy, but the extent and dose of the radiation fields is altered on the basis of both the size of the primary lesion and the presence and extent of nodal involvement. The radiologist must recognize and report these critical anatomic and staging distinctions, which affect use of radiation therapy in patients with anal and rectal cancers.",Journal Article,,13.0,Although and cancers are anatomically close they are distinct entities with different histologic features risk factors staging systems and treatment pathways Imaging is at the core of initial clinical staging of these cancers and most commonly includes magnetic resonance imaging for local-regional staging and computed tomography for evaluation of metastatic disease The details of the primary tumor and involvement of regional lymph nodes are crucial in determining if and how radiation therapy should be used in treatment of these cancers Unfortunately available imaging modalities have been shown to have imperfect accuracy for identification of nodal metastases and imaging features other than size Staging of nonmetastatic cancers is dependent on the depth of invasion T stage and the number of involved regional lymph nodes N stage Staging of nonmetastatic cancers is determined according to the size of the primary mass and the combination of regional nodal sites involved the number of positive nodes at each site is not a consideration for staging Patients with T3 tumors and/or involvement of perirectal mesenteric and internal iliac lymph nodes receive radiation therapy Almost all cancers warrant use of radiation therapy but the extent and dose of the radiation fields is altered on the basis of both the size of the primary lesion and the presence and extent of nodal involvement The radiologist must recognize and report these critical anatomic and staging distinctions which affect use of radiation therapy in patients with and cancers,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[242, 2, 163, 32, 9622, 2336, 491, 32, 834, 4613, 5, 338, 884, 404, 43, 130, 632, 1530, 2, 24, 460, 270, 16, 28, 3, 1793, 1, 388, 38, 632, 1, 46, 163, 2, 96, 841, 1920, 1484, 1535, 270, 9, 293, 951, 632, 2, 1220, 872, 9, 451, 1, 113, 34, 3, 3791, 1, 3, 86, 30, 2, 799, 1, 951, 263, 502, 32, 2653, 4, 2196, 492, 2, 832, 121, 36, 257, 40, 95, 4, 24, 1, 46, 163, 3869, 390, 270, 1558, 47, 85, 443, 6, 47, 13613, 1190, 9, 911, 1, 779, 196, 2, 270, 404, 127, 76, 444, 632, 1, 2683, 163, 16, 470, 23, 3, 2436, 1, 578, 102, 82, 2, 3, 207, 1, 646, 951, 263, 502, 78, 82, 632, 1, 2683, 163, 16, 509, 768, 6, 3, 444, 1, 3, 86, 782, 2, 3, 150, 1, 951, 779, 633, 646, 3, 207, 1, 109, 502, 28, 296, 606, 16, 44, 8, 2415, 9, 632, 7, 5, 2065, 57, 2, 15, 799, 1, 12796, 5719, 2, 2329, 6692, 263, 502, 560, 121, 36, 2214, 62, 163, 2946, 119, 1, 121, 36, 84, 3, 1039, 2, 61, 1, 3, 121, 3130, 16, 1495, 23, 3, 877, 1, 110, 3, 444, 1, 3, 86, 1180, 2, 3, 463, 2, 1039, 1, 779, 799, 3, 6247, 1642, 4237, 2, 414, 46, 740, 2745, 2, 632, 16834, 92, 1158, 119, 1, 121, 36, 4, 7, 5, 2, 163]",1552.0,26562239,59

Irradiation of FDG-PET-Defined Active Bone Marrow Subregions and Acute Hematologic Toxicity in Anal Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemoradiation.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2015-12-17,"Irradiation of pelvic bone marrow (BM) has been correlated with hematologic toxicity (HT) in patients undergoing chemoradiation for anal cancer. We hypothesized that irradiation of hematologically active bone marrow (ABM) subregions defined by fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is a principal cause of radiation-associated HT. The cohort included 45 patients with nonmetastatic anal cancer who underwent FDG-PET imaging prior to definitive chemoradiation with mitomycin-C and 5-fluorouracil. Total bone marrow (TBM) was defined as the external contour of the pelvic bones from the top of lumbar 5 (L5) to the bottom of the ischial tuberosity. Standardized uptake values (SUV) for all voxels within the TBM were quantified and normalized by comparison to normal liver SUV. Subvolumes of the TBM that exhibited the highest and lowest 50% of the SUVs were designated ABM50 and IBM50, respectively. The primary endpoint was the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) nadir during or within 2 weeks of completion of treatment. Multivariate linear modeling was used to analyze the correlation between the equivalent uniform doses (EUD) with an a value of 0.5, 1 (equivalent to mean dose), 3, 7, and 12 to the BM structures and the ANC. Mean ± SD ANC nadir was 0.77 × 10(9)/L (±0.66 × 10(9)/L). Grades 3 and 4 ANC toxicity occurred in 26.7% and 44.4% of patients, respectively. The EUD a parameter of 0.5 was optimal for all BM models indicating high radiation sensitivity. EUD of TBM and ABM50 and IBM50 were all significantly associated with ANC nadir. However, model performance for ABM50 was not superior to that of the TBM and IBM50 models. Irradiation of pelvic BM was associated with HT.

Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition in metastatic anal cancer.,Anti-cancer drugs,Anticancer Drugs,2016-09-01,"Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) anal cancer is relatively rare. With limited data, cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil has traditionally been utilized in the first-line setting. Treatment beyond front-line cisplatin progression is not well defined. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is highly overexpressed in SCCA anal cancer and EGFR inhibition may represent a potential treatment target for this population in need. Our case series evaluated metastatic SCCA anal cancer patients who received an EGFR monoclonal antibody as second-line or third-line therapy. Data collected consisted of demographics, previous treatment, metastatic disease sites, localized therapy received, regimen received, first radiographic result, progression-free survival, and overall survival. A total of 17 patients were included, with most (76%) patients receiving an EGFR monoclonal antibody in the second-line setting. Common regimens identified combined cetuximab or panitumumab with a fluoropyrimidine plus platinum (35%), carboplatin plus paclitaxel (29%), or cisplatin plus vinorelbine (18%). Thirty-five percent of patients achieved a response and 24% had stable disease. The overall median progression-free survival and overall survival were 7.3 and 24.7 months, respectively. Compared with our large retrospective study in the front-line metastatic anal cancer setting, our study suggests that anti-EGFR therapy in combination with certain chemotherapy derived additional benefit in the refractory setting. In the metastatic setting, there is a need to discover effective therapies.

Radiosensitivity Differences Between Liver Metastases Based on Primary Histology Suggest Implications for Clinical Outcomes After Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2016-04-08,"Evidence from the management of oligometastases with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) reveals differences in outcomes based on primary histology. We have previously identified a multigene expression index for tumor radiosensitivity (RSI) with validation in multiple independent cohorts. In this study, we assessed RSI in liver metastases and assessed our clinical outcomes after SBRT based on primary histology. Patients were identified from our prospective, observational protocol. The previously tested RSI 10 gene assay was run on samples and calculated using the published algorithm. An independent cohort of 33 patients with 38 liver metastases treated with SBRT was used for clinical correlation. A total of 372 unique metastatic liver lesions were identified for inclusion from our prospective, institutional metadata pool. The most common primary histologies for liver metastases were colorectal adenocarcinoma (n=314, 84.4%), breast adenocarcinoma (n=12, 3.2%), and pancreas neuroendocrine (n=11, 3%). There were significant differences in RSI of liver metastases based on histology. The median RSIs for liver metastases in descending order of radioresistance were gastrointestinal stromal tumor (0.57), melanoma (0.53), colorectal neuroendocrine (0.46), pancreas neuroendocrine (0.44), colorectal adenocarcinoma (0.43), breast adenocarcinoma (0.35), lung adenocarcinoma (0.31), pancreas adenocarcinoma (0.27), anal squamous cell cancer (0.22), and small intestine neuroendocrine (0.21) (P<.0001).

Regular Aspirin Use Associates With Lower Risk of Colorectal Cancers With Low Numbers of Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes.,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,2016-07-27,"Aspirin use reduces colorectal cancer risk. Aspirin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, inhibits prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2 or cyclooxygenase-2); PTGS2 promotes inflammation and suppresses T-cell-mediated adaptive immunity. We investigated whether the inverse association of aspirin use with colorectal carcinoma risk was stronger for tumors with lower degrees of lymphocytic infiltrates than for tumors with higher degrees of lymphocytic infiltrates. We collected aspirin use data biennially from participants in the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Participants were asked whether they took aspirin in most weeks, the number of tablets taken per week, and years of aspirin use. We collected available tumor specimens (n = 1458) from pathology laboratories in the United States. A pathologist confirmed the diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma (excluding anal squamous cell carcinoma), and evaluated histopathology features, including patterns and degrees of lymphocytic infiltrates within and around tumor areas. Person-years of follow-up evaluation were accrued from the date of return of questionnaires until dates of colorectal cancer diagnosis, death, or the end of follow-up evaluation (June 2010). Duplication-method Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the association of aspirin with the incidence of colorectal carcinoma subgroups according to the degree of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), intratumoral periglandular reaction, peritumoral reaction, or Crohn's-like reaction. We documented 1458 rectal and colon cancers. The inverse association between regular aspirin use and colorectal cancer risk significantly differed by concentrations of TILs (P<sub>heterogeneity</sub> = .007). Compared with nonregular use, regular aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of tumors that had low levels of TILs (relative risk, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.81), and strength of the association depended on aspirin dose and duration (both P<sub>trend</sub> < .001). In contrast, aspirin use was not associated with a risk of tumors having intermediate or high levels of TILs. This differential association was consistent regardless of the status of tumor microsatellite instability, mutations in BRAF, or expression of PTGS2.

Impact of facility volume on outcomes in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal: Analysis of the National Cancer Data Base.,Cancer,Cancer,2016-08-29,"Given the rarity of anal cancer and the technical aspects involved in radiation (RT) planning, the authors conducted a population-based analysis evaluating the impact of radiation oncology facility volume on overall survival (OS) in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the anal canal. The National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) was queried for patients with SCC of the anal canal who underwent RT. All patients were coded as having received their entire course of RT at the NCDB reporting facility. Facility volume was categorized into tertiles (low, intermediate, and high) and was based on the number of times a facility's unique identification code appeared. In total, 13,550 patients were identified. Patients who received treatment at higher volume radiation oncology facilities had longer OS based on multivariate analysis (MVA) (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-0.90; P < .001) and propensity score matching analysis (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69-0.91; P < .001). For patients who received treatment at low-volume, intermediate-volume, and high-volume centers, the 5-year OS rate was 70%, 72.2%, and 75.4%, respectively (P < .001). Compared with low/intermediate-volume radiation oncology centers, high-volume centers were more likely to treat patients with concurrent chemotherapy (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.07-1.51; P = .006) and less likely to have treatment delays leading to an RT duration of >45 days (odds ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.69-0.80; P < .001). Treatment at higher volume radiation oncology centers appears to be associated with improved OS in patients with SCC of the anal canal. These results likely reflect the relation between physician experience and delivery of high-quality RT, which perhaps is best evident in rare tumors such as anal SCC.

Distance to the anal verge is associated with pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant therapy in locally advanced rectal cancer.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2016-09-19,"Achieving a pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant therapy has been associated with better prognosis in rectal cancer patients. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between distance to the anal verge (DTAV) and pCR. Review of a prospectively maintained database of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who received neoadjuvant treatment was completed. Uni- and multivariate analysis assessed the association between DTAV and pCR after neoadjuvant therapy. Of 827 included patients, 20% had a pCR. We found that pCR rates were 11% for tumors <4 cm, 24% for tumors 4-6 cm, 30% for tumors at 6-8 cm, 17% for tumors 8-10 cm, and 14% for tumors >10 cm from the anal verge (P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis also showed a strong association between DTAV and pCR (P = 0.008). The bimodal distribution of pCR resulted in a lower odds ratio of pCR for tumors <4 and >8 cm from the anal verge. Patients with low tumors (<4 cm) and higher tumors (>8 cm), were less likely to have a pCR. Further investigation is warranted to determine if these observations are related to tumor biology or possibly differences in radiation technique. J. Surg.

"Awareness and knowledge of Human Papillomavirus (HPV), HPV-related cancers, and HPV vaccines in an uninsured adult clinic population.",Cancer medicine,Cancer Med,2016-10-17,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines offer primary prevention of cervical cancer and protection against other HPV-associated cancers. HPV vaccine coverage in the United States (U.S.) remains low, particularly among older adolescents/young adults, and the uninsured. We assessed awareness and knowledge of HPV disease, HPV-related cancers, and HPV vaccines among working, uninsured adults. Data from the 2014 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 4, Cycle 4) were used as a benchmark. Patients were surveyed in late 2014 at the Volunteers in Medicine free clinic in Duval County, Florida. Surveys contained validated measures of HPV disease and vaccine knowledge; HPV-related cancer knowledge was also assessed. Two-hundred and ninety-six surveys were analyzable with an 84% participation rate. Half (50.3%) of participants had heard of HPV, and 32.1% had heard of the HPV vaccine; in HINTS, these estimates were 63.6% and 62.7%, respectively (both P < 0.0001). In adjusted models, high HPV disease knowledge was associated with white race and increased education; high vaccine knowledge was associated with white race, increased education, and female sex. Recognition of HPV as a causative agent was 43.9% for cervical, 9.1% for anal, and 11.1% for throat cancers.

Clinical and Economic Evaluation of Treatment Strategies for T1N0 Anal Canal Cancer.,American journal of clinical oncology,Am. J. Clin.

We compared the outcomes associated with the treatment alternatives-chemoradiotherapy (CRT), radiotherapy (RT), and surgery or ablation techniques (surgery/ablation)-for T1N0 anal canal cancer. This retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registries linked with Medicare longitudinal data (SEER-Medicare database). Analysis included 190 patients who were treated for T1N0 anal canal cancer using surgery/ablation (n=44), RT (n=50), or CRT (n=96). The outcomes were reported in terms of survival and hazards ratios using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards modeling, respectively; lifetime costs; and cost-effectiveness measured in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, that is, the ratio of the difference in costs between the 2 alternatives to the difference in effectiveness between the same 2 alternatives. There was no significant difference in the survival duration between the treatment groups as predicted by the Kaplan-Meier curves. After adjusting for patient characteristics and propensity score, the hazard ratio of death for the patients who received CRT compared with surgery/ablation was 1.742 (95% confidence interval, 0.793-3.829) and RT was 2.170 (95% confidence interval, 0.923-5.101); however, the relationship did not reach statistical significance. Surgery/ablation resulted in lower lifetime cost than RT or CRT. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio associated with CRT compared with surgery/ablation was $142,883 per life year gained.

All 3 types of crude rate were expressed as the number that occurred per hundred person-years (hPY) of follow-up. Samples from 41 subjects were evaluated for PD-L1 expression; 23 (56%) were positive.

Genomic Evolution after Chemoradiotherapy in Anal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2016-11-16,"<b>Purpose:</b> Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (ASCC) accounts for 2% to 4% of gastrointestinal malignancies in the United States and is increasing in incidence; however, genomic features of ASCC are incompletely characterized. Primary treatment of ASCC involves concurrent chemotherapy and radiation (CRT), but the mutational landscape of resistance to CRT is unknown. Here, we aim to compare mutational features of ASCC in the pre- and post-CRT setting.<b>Experimental Design:</b> We perform whole-exome sequencing of primary (<i>n</i> = 31) and recurrent (<i>n</i> = 30) ASCCs and correlate findings with clinical data. We compare genomic features of matched pre- and post-CRT tumors to identify genomic features of CRT response. Finally, we investigate the mutational underpinnings of an extraordinary ASCC response to immunotherapy.<b>Results:</b> We find that both primary and recurrent ASCC tumors harbor mutations in genes, such as <i>PIK3CA</i> and <i>FBXW7</i>, that are also mutated in other HPV-associated cancers. Overall mutational burden was not significantly different in pre- versus post-CRT tumors, and several examples of shared clonal driver mutations were identified. In two cases, clonally related pre- and post-CRT tumors harbored distinct oncogenic driver mutations in the same cancer gene (<i>KRAS</i> or <i>FBXW7</i>). A patient with recurrent disease achieved an exceptional response to anti-programmed death (PD-1) therapy, and genomic dissection revealed high mutational burden and predicted neoantigen load.<b>Conclusions:</b> We perform comprehensive mutational analysis of ASCC and characterize mutational features associated with CRT.

Cetuximab Plus Chemoradiotherapy for HIV-Associated Anal Carcinoma: A Phase II AIDS Malignancy Consortium Trial.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-12-12,"Purpose Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCAC) is characterized by high locoregional failure (LRF) rates after definitive chemoradiation (CRT), associated with anogenital human papilloma virus, and often appears in HIV infection. Because cetuximab enhances the effect of radiation therapy in human papilloma virus-associated oropharyngeal SCC, we hypothesized that adding cetuximab to CRT would reduce LRF in SCCAC. Methods Forty-five patients with stage I to III SCCAC and HIV infection received CRT: 45 to 54 Gy radiation therapy to the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes plus eight once-weekly doses of concurrent cetuximab and two cycles of cisplatin and fluorouracil. The study was designed to detect at least a 50% reduction in 3-year LRF rate (one-sided α, 0.10; power, 90%), assuming a 35% LRF rate from historical data. Results The 3-year LRF rate was 42% (95% CI, 28% to 56%; one-sided P = .9) by binomial proportional estimate using the prespecified end point (LRF or alive without LRF and followed < 3 years), and 20% (95% CI, 10% to 37%) by Kaplan-Meier estimate in post hoc analysis using definitions and methods consistent with historical data. Three-year rates by Kaplan-Meier estimate were 72% (95% CI, 56% to 84%) for progression-free survival and 79% (95% CI, 63% to 89%) for overall survival.

Cetuximab Plus Chemoradiotherapy in Immunocompetent Patients With Anal Carcinoma: A Phase II Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-American College of Radiology Imaging Network Cancer Research Group Trial (E3205).,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2017-01-09,"Purpose Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCAC) is characterized by high locoregional failure (LRF) rates after sphincter-preserving definitive chemoradiation (CRT) and is typically associated with anogenital human papilloma virus infection. Because cetuximab enhances the effect of radiation therapy in human papilloma virus-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, we hypothesized that adding cetuximab to CRT would reduce LRF in SCCAC. Methods Sixty-one patients with stage I to III SCCAC received CRT including cisplatin, fluorouracil, and radiation therapy to the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes (45 to 54 Gy) plus eight once-weekly doses of concurrent cetuximab. The study was designed to detect at least a 50% reduction in 3-year LRF rate (one-sided α, 0.10; power 90%), assuming a 35% LRF rate from historical data. Results Poor risk features included stage III disease in 64% and male sex in 20%. The 3-year LRF rate was 23% (95% CI, 13% to 36%; one-sided P = .03) by binomial proportional estimate using the prespecified end point and 21% (95% CI, 7% to 26%) by Kaplan-Meier estimate in a post hoc analysis using methods consistent with historical data. Three-year rates were 68% (95% CI, 55% to 79%) for progression-free survival and 83% (95% CI, 71% to 91%) for overall survival. Grade 4 toxicity occurred in 32%, and 5% had treatment-associated deaths. Conclusion Although the addition of cetuximab to chemoradiation for SCCAC was associated with lower LRF rates than historical data with CRT alone, toxicity was substantial, and LRF still occurs in approximately 20%, indicating the continued need for more effective and less toxic therapies.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",1107.0,23.0,Purpose Squamous cell carcinoma of the canal SCCAC is characterized by high locoregional failure LRF rates after sphincter-preserving definitive chemoradiation CRT and is typically associated with anogenital human papilloma virus infection Because cetuximab enhances the effect of radiation therapy in human papilloma virus-associated squamous cell carcinoma we hypothesized that adding cetuximab to CRT would reduce LRF in SCCAC Methods Sixty-one patients with stage I to III SCCAC received CRT including cisplatin fluorouracil and radiation therapy to the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes 45 to 54 Gy plus eight once-weekly doses of concurrent cetuximab The study was designed to detect at least a 50 reduction in 3-year LRF rate one-sided 0.10 power 90 assuming a 35 LRF rate from historical data Results Poor risk features included stage III disease in 64 and male sex in 20 The 3-year LRF rate was 23 95 CI 13 to 36 one-sided P .03 by binomial proportional estimate using the prespecified end point and 21 95 CI 7 to 26 by Kaplan-Meier estimate in a post hoc analysis using methods consistent with historical data Three-year rates were 68 95 CI 55 to 79 for progression-free survival and 83 95 CI 71 to 91 for overall survival Grade 4 toxicity occurred in 32 and 5 had treatment-associated deaths Conclusion Although the addition of cetuximab to chemoradiation for SCCAC was associated with lower LRF rates than historical data with CRT alone toxicity was substantial and LRF still occurs in approximately 20 indicating the continued need for more effective and less toxic therapies,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[743, 691, 31, 134, 1, 3, 5614, 21603, 16, 765, 20, 64, 1325, 496, 6482, 151, 50, 5400, 4972, 1057, 975, 1089, 2, 16, 1969, 41, 5, 13836, 171, 7017, 1450, 930, 408, 1175, 2519, 3, 254, 1, 121, 36, 4, 171, 7017, 1450, 41, 691, 31, 134, 21, 1237, 17, 2726, 1175, 6, 1089, 688, 969, 6482, 4, 21603, 636, 1746, 104, 7, 5, 82, 70, 6, 316, 21603, 103, 1089, 141, 540, 1404, 2, 121, 36, 6, 3, 86, 30, 2, 951, 263, 502, 512, 6, 667, 381, 349, 659, 1059, 709, 415, 1, 750, 1175, 3, 45, 10, 1114, 6, 1426, 28, 506, 8, 212, 628, 4, 27, 111, 6482, 116, 104, 1689, 13, 79, 2349, 424, 7242, 8, 465, 6482, 116, 29, 2252, 74, 99, 334, 43, 404, 159, 82, 316, 34, 4, 660, 2, 1045, 1035, 4, 179, 3, 27, 111, 6482, 116, 10, 382, 48, 58, 233, 6, 511, 104, 1689, 19, 680, 20, 8538, 831, 1191, 75, 3, 4075, 396, 741, 2, 239, 48, 58, 67, 6, 432, 20, 876, 882, 1191, 4, 8, 539, 5428, 65, 75, 636, 925, 5, 2252, 74, 169, 111, 151, 11, 806, 48, 58, 614, 6, 842, 9, 91, 115, 25, 2, 852, 48, 58, 792, 6, 970, 9, 63, 25, 88, 39, 155, 489, 4, 531, 2, 33, 42, 24, 41, 1043, 1221, 242, 3, 352, 1, 1175, 6, 975, 9, 21603, 10, 41, 5, 280, 6482, 151, 76, 2252, 74, 5, 1089, 279, 155, 10, 1281, 2, 6482, 1234, 1780, 4, 705, 179, 1716, 3, 1351, 594, 9, 80, 323, 2, 299, 1812, 235]",1593.0,28068178,29
Hematologic Nadirs During Chemoradiation for Anal Cancer: Temporal Characterization and Dosimetric Predictors.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2016-10-19,"Pelvic bone marrow (BM) constraints may offer a means to reduce the toxicity commonly associated with chemoradiation for anal cancer. We conducted a bi-institutional analysis of dose-volume metrics in a time-sensitive fashion to devise practical metrics to minimize hematologic toxicity. Fifty-six anal cancer patients from 2 institutions received definitive radiation therapy (median primary dose of 54 Gy) using intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT, n=49) or 3-dimensional (3D) conformal therapy (n=7) with concurrent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin C. Weekly blood counts were retrospectively plotted to characterize the time course of cytopenias. Dose-volume parameters were correlated with blood counts at a standardized time point to identify predictors of initial blood count nadirs. Leukocytes, neutrophils, and platelets reached a nadir at week 3 of treatment. Smaller volumes of the pelvic BM correlated most strongly with lower week 3 blood counts, more so than age, sex, body mass index (BMI), or dose metrics. Patients who had ≥750 cc of pelvic BM spared from doses of ≥30 Gy had 0% grade 3+ leukopenia or neutropenia at week 3. Higher V40 Gy to the lower pelvic BM (LP V40) also correlated with cytopenia. Patients with an LP V40 >23% had higher rates of grade 3+ leukopenia (29% vs 4%, P=.02), grade 3+ neutropenia (33% vs 8%, P=.04), and grade 2+ thrombocytopenia (32% vs 7%, P=.04) at week 3. On multivariate analysis, pelvic BM volume and LP V40 remained associated with leukocyte count, and all marrow subsite volumes remained associated with neutrophil counts at week 3 (P<.1). Larger pelvic BM volumes correlate with less severe leukocyte and neutrophil nadirs, suggesting that larger total ""marrow reserve"" can mitigate cytopenias. Sparing a critical marrow reserve and limiting the V40 Gy to the lower pelvis may reduce the risk of hematologic toxicity.",Journal Article,1189.0,7.0,Pelvic marrow BM constraints may offer a means to reduce the toxicity commonly associated with chemoradiation for cancer We conducted a bi-institutional analysis of dose-volume metrics in a time-sensitive fashion to devise practical metrics to minimize hematologic toxicity Fifty-six cancer patients from 2 institutions received definitive radiation therapy median primary dose of 54 Gy using intensity modulated radiation therapy IMRT n=49 or 3-dimensional 3D conformal therapy n=7 with concurrent 5-fluorouracil 5-FU and mitomycin C.

Significance of Co-expression of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor and Ki67 on Clinical Outcome in Patients With Anal Cancer Treated With Chemoradiotherapy: An Analysis of NRG Oncology RTOG 9811.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2016-11-23,"To measure co-expression of EGFR and Ki67 proteins in pretreatment tumor biopsies of anal cancer patients enrolled on NRG Oncology RTOG 9811, a phase III trial comparing 5-fluorouracil/mitomycin-C/radiation therapy (Arm A) versus 5-fluorouracil/cisplatin/radiation therapy (Arm B), and to correlate expression with clinical outcome. EGFR and Ki67 co-expression was measured after constructing a tissue microarray using fluorescence immunohistochemistry and automated quantitative image analysis. The Ki67 score within EGFR high versus low areas (Ki67ratio in EGFR<sub>high:low</sub>) in each tumor core was analyzed at the median, quartiles, and as a continuous variable. Associations between the tumor markers and clinical endpoints (overall and disease-free survival, locoregional and colostomy failure, and distant metastases) were explored. A total of 282 pretreatment tumors were analyzed from NRG Oncology RTOG 9811. Of evaluated specimens, 183 (65%, n=89, Arm A; n=94, Arm B) were eligible and analyzable. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics or outcomes between analyzable and unanalyzable patient cases. Median follow-up was 6.0 years. On multivariate analysis, after adjusting for gender, patients with Ki67ratio in EGFR<sub>high:low</sub> ≥median had worse overall survival (hazard ratio 2.41, 95% confidence interval 1.38-4.19, P=.0019). After adjusting for N stage and largest tumor dimension, patients with Ki67ratio in EGFR<sub>high:low</sub> ≥ median had a higher risk of a disease-free failure (hazard ratio 1.85, 95% confidence interval 1.18-2.92, P=.0078).

Because of the limited data, treatment of metastatic disease is a major therapeutic challenge. In this study, we report the safety and efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in patients with advanced squamous cell anal carcinomas. A retrospective analysis was conducted using the Moffitt Cancer Tumor Registry from January 2009 to January 2014. Eligible patients had diagnosis of advanced squamous cell anal carcinomas and received an EGFR inhibitor as part of their treatment. A total of 13 patients were identified for analysis. All of them received concurrent chemoradiation as initial treatment and subsequently had recurrence. Five patients received single agent cetuximab or panitumumab, and the others received cetuximab or panitumumab with irinotecan or FOLFIRI. The objective response rate was 30.8% including 1 complete response, and the disease control rate was 46.2%. With a median follow-up of 9.6 months, the median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 4.4 months and 11.4 months, respectively.

Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2017-02-18,"Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCA) is a rare malignancy associated with infection by human papillomavirus (HPV). No consensus treatment approach exists for the treatment of metastatic disease. Because intratumoral HPV oncoproteins upregulate immune checkpoint proteins such as PD-1 to evade immune-mediated cytotoxicity, we did a trial of the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab for patients with metastatic SCCA. We did this single-arm, multicentre, phase 2 trial at ten academic centres in the USA. We enrolled patients with treatment-refractory metastatic SCCA, who were given nivolumab every 2 weeks (3 mg/kg). The primary endpoint was response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, in the intention-to-treat population. At the time of data cutoff, the study was ongoing, with patients continuing to receive treatment. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02314169. We screened 39 patients, of whom 37 were enrolled and received at least one dose of nivolumab. Among the 37 patients, nine (24% [95% CI 15-33]) had responses. There were two complete responses and seven partial responses. Grade 3 adverse events were anaemia (n=2), fatigue (n=1), rash (n=1), and hypothyroidism (n=1). No serious adverse events were reported. To our knowledge, this is the first completed phase 2 trial of immunotherapy for SCCA. Nivolumab is well tolerated and effective as a monotherapy for patients with metastatic SCCA. Immune checkpoint blockade appears to be a promising approach for patients with this orphan disease.

Anal SCC tumor specimens derived from the AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource (National Cancer Institute) and Johns Hopkins Hospital included specimens. Tumors were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis for immune checkpoints (PD-L1, PD-1, LAG-3) and immune cell (IC) subsets (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD68). Expression profiling for immune-related genes was performed on select HIV-positive and HIV-negative cases in PD-L1+ tumor areas associated with ICs. Programmed death-ligand 1 expression on tumor cells and ICs, PD-L1 patterns (adaptive vs constitutive), degree of IC infiltration, quantified densities of IC subsets, and gene expression profiles in anal SCCs from HIV-positive vs HIV-negative patients. Approximately half of 40 tumor specimens from 23 HIV-positive and 17 HIV-negative patients (29 men and 11 women; mean [SD] age, 51 [9.9] years) demonstrated tumor cell PD-L1 expression, regardless of HIV status. Median IC densities were not significantly decreased in HIV-associated tumors for any cellular subset studied. Both adaptive (IC-associated) and constitutive PD-L1 expression patterns were observed. Immune cell PD-L1 expression correlated with increasing intensity of IC infiltration (r = 0.52; 95% CI, 0.26-0.78; P < .001) and with CD8+ T-cell density (r = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.11-0.59; P = .03). Gene expression profiling revealed comparable levels of IFNG in the TME of both HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. A significant increase in IL18 expression levels was observed in HIV-associated anal SCCs (fold change, 12.69; P < .001). HIV status does not correlate with the degree or composition of IC infiltration or PD-L1 expression in anal SCC. These findings demonstrate an immune-reactive TME in anal SCCs from HIV-positive patients and support clinical investigations of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade in anal SCC, irrespective of patient HIV status.",Journal Article,934.0,24.0,The programmed cell death protein 1 PD-1 and programmed death-ligand 1 PD-L1 pathway play an important immunosuppressive role in cancer and chronic viral infection and have been effectively targeted in cancer therapy squamous cell carcinoma SCC is associated with both human papillomavirus and HIV infection To date patients with HIV have been excluded from most trials of immune checkpoint blocking agents such as anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 because it was assumed that their antitumor immunity was compromised compared with immunocompetent patients To compare the local tumor immune microenvironment TME in SCCs from HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients SCC tumor specimens derived from the AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource National Cancer Institute and Johns Hopkins Hospital included specimens Tumors were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis for immune checkpoints PD-L1 PD-1 LAG-3 and immune cell IC subsets CD3 CD4 CD8 CD68 Expression profiling for immune-related genes was performed on select HIV-positive and HIV-negative cases in PD-L1+ tumor areas associated with ICs Programmed death-ligand 1 expression on tumor cells and ICs PD-L1 patterns adaptive vs constitutive degree of IC infiltration quantified densities of IC subsets and gene expression profiles in SCCs from HIV-positive vs HIV-negative patients Approximately half of 40 tumor specimens from 23 HIV-positive and 17 HIV-negative patients 29 men and 11 women mean SD age 51 9.9 years demonstrated tumor cell PD-L1 expression regardless of HIV status Median IC densities were not significantly decreased in HIV-associated tumors for any cellular subset studied Both adaptive IC-associated and constitutive PD-L1 expression patterns were observed Immune cell PD-L1 expression correlated with increasing intensity of IC infiltration r 0.52 95 CI 0.26-0.78 P .001 and with CD8+ T-cell density r 0.35 95 CI 0.11-0.59 P .03 Gene expression profiling revealed comparable levels of IFNG in the TME of both HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients A significant increase in IL18 expression levels was observed in HIV-associated SCCs fold change 12.69 P .001 HIV status does not correlate with the degree or composition of IC infiltration or PD-L1 expression in SCC These findings demonstrate an immune-reactive TME in SCCs from HIV-positive patients and support clinical investigations of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade in SCC irrespective of patient HIV status,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1846, 31, 273, 178, 14, 333, 14, 2, 1846, 273, 1232, 14, 333, 729, 308, 1343, 35, 305, 2989, 200, 4, 12, 2, 442, 1667, 930, 2, 47, 85, 1856, 238, 4, 12, 36, 691, 31, 134, 1791, 16, 41, 5, 110, 171, 3242, 2, 1942, 930, 6, 1244, 7, 5, 1942, 47, 85, 1800, 29, 96, 143, 1, 250, 986, 2521, 183, 225, 22, 312, 333, 14, 2, 312, 333, 729, 408, 192, 10, 6719, 17, 136, 579, 1604, 10, 4867, 72, 5, 6749, 7, 6, 932, 3, 293, 30, 250, 995, 5145, 4, 6334, 29, 1942, 109, 2, 1942, 199, 7, 1791, 30, 623, 526, 29, 3, 4174, 2, 12, 2360, 3069, 657, 12, 1377, 2, 5848, 5569, 702, 159, 623, 57, 11, 4325, 6, 1382, 65, 9, 250, 4704, 333, 729, 333, 14, 7650, 27, 2, 250, 31, 2340, 1890, 3117, 1440, 968, 6439, 55, 1080, 9, 250, 139, 214, 10, 173, 23, 1717, 1942, 109, 2, 1942, 199, 140, 4, 333, 729, 30, 1361, 41, 5, 9823, 1846, 273, 1232, 14, 55, 23, 30, 37, 2, 9823, 333, 729, 764, 2454, 105, 3178, 1444, 1, 2340, 2084, 2790, 6908, 1, 2340, 1890, 2, 145, 55, 1241, 4, 6334, 29, 1942, 109, 105, 1942, 199, 7, 705, 1303, 1, 327, 30, 623, 29, 382, 1942, 109, 2, 269, 1942, 199, 7, 462, 325, 2, 175, 117, 313, 1270, 89, 725, 83, 83, 60, 264, 30, 31, 333, 729, 55, 1583, 1, 1942, 156, 52, 2340, 6908, 11, 44, 97, 340, 4, 1942, 41, 57, 9, 500, 763, 697, 656, 110, 2454, 2340, 41, 2, 3178, 333, 729, 55, 764, 11, 164, 250, 31, 333, 729, 55, 438, 5, 602, 837, 1, 2340, 2084, 668, 13, 653, 48, 58, 13, 432, 13, 833, 19, 144, 2, 5, 968, 102, 31, 1263, 668, 13, 465, 48, 58, 13, 175, 13, 728, 19, 680, 145, 55, 1080, 553, 1279, 148, 1, 21266, 4, 3, 5145, 1, 110, 1942, 109, 2, 1942, 199, 7, 8, 93, 344, 4, 28863, 55, 148, 10, 164, 4, 1942, 41, 6334, 1116, 707, 133, 790, 19, 144, 1942, 156, 1097, 44, 1513, 5, 3, 1444, 15, 3761, 1, 2340, 2084, 15, 333, 729, 55, 4, 1791, 46, 272, 608, 35, 250, 2163, 5145, 4, 6334, 29, 1942, 109, 7, 2, 538, 38, 2492, 1, 333, 14, 333, 729, 986, 1189, 4, 1791, 3500, 1, 69, 1942, 156]",2427.0,28334399,160
Irradiation of anatomically defined pelvic subsites and acute hematologic toxicity in anal cancer patients undergoing chemoradiation.,Practical radiation oncology,Pract Radiat Oncol,2017-03-23,"Chemoradiation for the treatment of anal cancer is known to cause significant hematologic toxicity (HT). We sought to investigate if radiation dose to specific pelvic subsites is associated with increased HT risk. Forty-five patients with nonmetastatic anal cancer who received definitive chemoradiation with intensity modulated radiation therapy and concurrent mitomycin-C and 5-fluorouracil were studied. Total pelvic bone marrow (TBM) was divided into 3 subsites: lumbosacral bone marrow (LSBM), including the entire sacrum and L5 vertebral body; iliac bone marrow (IBM) extending from the iliac crests to the superior border of the femoral head; and lower pelvic bone marrow, including the pubic bones, ischia, acetabula, and proximal femurs. The primary endpoint was absolute neutrophil count (ANC) nadir during or within 2 weeks of treatment completion. Generalized linear modeling was used to analyze the correlation between the equivalent uniform dose (with an ""a"" value of 0.5) to the individual pelvic subsites and the various hematologic endpoints. Age, body mass index, sex, baseline blood counts, and immunosuppression were analyzed as potential covariates. Mean ± standard deviation ANC nadir was 0.77 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (±0.66 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L). Grades 3+ and 4+ neutropenia occurred in 71.1% and 44.4% of patients, respectively. In addition to radiation dose to pelvic bone marrow, baseline ANC was the only significant predictor of hematologic toxicity on multivariable analysis and was included in all models. The equivalent uniform doses of TBM, LSBM, and IBM were each significantly associated with neutropenia. The model performance of TBM (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.226) was similar to both LSBM (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.206) and IBM (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.249). Radiation doses to TBM, LSBM, and IBM were individually associated with HT, suggesting that sparing just a portion of pelvic bone marrow is insufficient to decrease rates of clinically significant bone marrow suppression.",Journal Article,1034.0,1.0,Chemoradiation for the treatment of cancer is known to cause significant hematologic toxicity HT We sought to investigate if radiation dose to specific pelvic subsites is associated with increased HT risk Forty-five patients with nonmetastatic cancer who received definitive chemoradiation with intensity modulated radiation therapy and concurrent mitomycin-C and 5-fluorouracil were studied Total pelvic marrow TBM was divided into 3 subsites lumbosacral marrow LSBM including the entire sacrum and L5 vertebral body iliac marrow IBM extending from the iliac crests to the superior border of the femoral head and lower pelvic marrow including the pubic bones ischia acetabula and proximal femurs The primary endpoint was absolute neutrophil count ANC nadir during or within 2 weeks of treatment completion Generalized linear modeling was used to analyze the correlation between the equivalent uniform dose with an `` a '' value of 0.5 to the individual pelvic subsites and the various hematologic endpoints Age body mass index sex baseline blood counts and immunosuppression were analyzed as potential covariates Mean ± standard deviation ANC nadir was 0.77 10 sup 9 /sup /L ±0.66 10 sup 9 /sup /L Grades 3+ and 4+ neutropenia occurred in 71.1 and 44.4 of patients respectively In addition to radiation dose to pelvic marrow baseline ANC was the only significant predictor of hematologic toxicity on multivariable analysis and was included in all models The equivalent uniform doses of TBM LSBM and IBM were each significantly associated with neutropenia The model performance of TBM adjusted R sup 2 /sup 0.226 was similar to both LSBM adjusted R sup 2 /sup 0.206 and IBM adjusted R sup 2 /sup 0.249 Radiation doses to TBM LSBM and IBM were individually associated with HT suggesting that sparing just a portion of pelvic marrow is insufficient to decrease rates of clinically significant marrow suppression,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[975, 9, 3, 24, 1, 12, 16, 440, 6, 708, 93, 813, 155, 3152, 21, 990, 6, 963, 492, 121, 61, 6, 112, 1110, 11239, 16, 41, 5, 101, 3152, 43, 1213, 365, 7, 5, 2683, 12, 54, 103, 1057, 975, 5, 837, 1757, 121, 36, 2, 750, 5837, 256, 2, 33, 1404, 11, 656, 181, 1110, 581, 22919, 10, 2176, 237, 27, 11239, 15598, 581, 32583, 141, 3, 1797, 11629, 2, 24535, 4731, 642, 6692, 581, 27522, 4782, 29, 3, 6692, 44933, 6, 3, 1123, 11793, 1, 3, 7649, 718, 2, 280, 1110, 581, 141, 3, 24676, 7867, 70311, 70312, 2, 2805, 29071, 3, 86, 1138, 10, 1766, 2595, 1276, 6486, 3686, 190, 15, 262, 18, 244, 1, 24, 1438, 4169, 1646, 2057, 10, 95, 6, 1992, 3, 816, 59, 3, 2017, 3490, 61, 5, 35, 8, 522, 549, 1, 13, 33, 6, 3, 797, 1110, 11239, 2, 3, 747, 813, 1387, 89, 642, 782, 558, 1035, 330, 315, 1911, 2, 3646, 11, 311, 22, 174, 2489, 313, 810, 260, 3348, 6486, 3686, 10, 13, 849, 79, 172, 83, 172, 805, 18068, 700, 79, 172, 83, 172, 805, 2276, 27, 2, 39, 778, 489, 4, 792, 14, 2, 584, 39, 1, 7, 106, 4, 352, 6, 121, 61, 6, 1110, 581, 330, 6486, 10, 3, 158, 93, 980, 1, 813, 155, 23, 658, 65, 2, 10, 159, 4, 62, 274, 3, 2017, 3490, 415, 1, 22919, 32583, 2, 27522, 11, 296, 97, 41, 5, 778, 3, 202, 528, 1, 22919, 586, 668, 172, 18, 172, 13, 7400, 10, 288, 6, 110, 32583, 586, 668, 172, 18, 172, 13, 5956, 2, 27522, 586, 668, 172, 18, 172, 13, 7144, 121, 415, 6, 22919, 32583, 2, 27522, 11, 4257, 41, 5, 3152, 802, 17, 1851, 4673, 8, 3206, 1, 1110, 581, 16, 3027, 6, 775, 151, 1, 505, 93, 581, 1332]",1909.0,28462895,54
Predictors of Radiation Therapy-Related Gastrointestinal Toxicity From Anal Cancer Dose-Painted Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy: Secondary Analysis of NRG Oncology RTOG 0529.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2017-02-13,"NRG Oncology RTOG 0529 assessed the feasibility of dose-painted intensity modulated radiation therapy (DP-IMRT) to reduce the acute morbidity of chemoradiation with 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and mitomycin-C (MMC) for T2-4N0-3M0 anal cancer. This secondary analysis was performed to identify patient and treatment factors associated with acute and late gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs). NRG Oncology RTOG 0529 treatment plans were reviewed to extract dose-volume data for tightly contoured small bowel, loosely contoured anterior pelvic contents (APC), and uninvolved colon outside the target volume (UC). Univariate logistic regression was performed to evaluate association between volumes of each structure receiving doses ≥5 to 60 Gy (V5-V60) in 5-Gy increments between patients with and without grade ≥2 acute and late GI AEs, and grade ≥3 acute GI AEs. Additional patient and treatment factors were evaluated in multivariate logistic regression (acute AEs) or Cox proportional hazards models (late AEs). Among 52 evaluable patients, grade ≥2 acute, grade ≥2 late, and grade ≥3 acute GI AEs were observed in 35, 17, and 10 patients, respectively. Trends (P<.05) toward statistically significant associations were observed between grade ≥2 acute GI AEs and small bowel dose (V20-V40), grade ≥2 late GI AEs and APC dose (V60), grade ≥3 acute GI AEs and APC dose (V5-V25), increasing age, tumor size >4 cm, and worse Zubrod performance status. Small bowel volumes of 186.0 cc, 155.0 cc, 41.0 cc, and 30.4 cc receiving doses greater than 25, 30, 35, and 40 Gy, respectively, correlated with increased risk of acute grade ≥2 GI AEs.

Multidisciplinary Clinics for Colorectal Cancer Care Reduces Treatment Time.,Clinical colorectal cancer,Clin Colorectal Cancer,2017-04-19,Management of locally advanced and metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) requires the expertise of multiple specialists. Multidisciplinary clinics (MDCs) are a working model designed to facilitate delivery of coordinated care. The present study evaluated the effects of MDC on the time to treatment (TTT). Patients with CRC or locally advanced anal cancer who were evaluated at a single-institution MDC from January 2014 to October 2015 were identified from an institutional registry. The clinical characteristics and timelines for various aspects of treatment were retrospectively reviewed and recorded. A control population of patients not evaluated at the MDC was matched 1:2 by disease and the number of treating specialties. The primary endpoints were the TTT from diagnosis and the TTT from the first consultation. A total of 105 patients were included: 35 were evaluated at the MDC and 70 were controls. The MDC patients experienced a 7.8-day shorter TTT from the first consultation (21.5 vs. 29.3 days; P = .01). The difference was greater for patients visiting 3 departments (21.3 vs. 30.6 days; P < .001). Patients requiring neoadjuvant chemoradiation accounted for most of the decreased interval compared with those requiring surgery alone as their first treatment. The proportion of patients initiating treatment within 3 weeks from the first consultation was greater for those seen in the MDC (57.1% vs. 30% for controls; P = .01). Implementation of a multidisciplinary CRC clinic yielded decreased intervals from the first consultation to treatment in our institution.

Elevated risk of human papillomavirus-related second cancers in survivors of anal canal cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2017-06-13,"Over the last decade, the causal link between human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and squamous cell carcinoma of the anus (SCCA) has been well described. Because HPV infection in one site is often associated with other sites of infection, it then follows that patients with SCCA may have an increased risk of additional HPV-related cancers. Identifying and targeting at-risk sites through cancer screening and surveillance may help to guide best practices. The current study sought to ascertain sites and risk of HPV-related second primary malignancies (SPMs) in survivors of SCCA. Using population-based data from 1992 through 2012, the authors identified patients with SCCA and determined their risk of HPV-related SPMs, including anal, oral, and genital cancers. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), defined as observed to expected cases, were calculated to determine excess risk. Of 10,537 patients with SCCA, 416 developed HPV-related SPMs, which corresponded to an overall SIR of 21.5 (99% confidence interval [99% CI], 19.0-24.2). Men were found to have a higher SIR (35.8; 99% CI, 30.7-41.6) compared with women (12.8; 99% CI, 10.4-15.5). SIRs for a second SCCA were markedly higher in men (127.5; 99% CI, 108.1-149.2) compared with women (47.0; 99% CI, 34.7-62.1), whereas SIRs for oral cavity and pharyngeal cancers were elevated in men (3.1; 99% CI, 1.5-5.7) and women (4.4; 99% CI, 1.5-9.7). SIRs for sex-specific sites also were elevated, with male genital cancers having an SIR of 19.6 (99% CI, 8.7-37.6) and female genital cancers an SIR of 8.3 (99% CI, 6.1-11.0). Patients with index SCCA are at an increased risk of subsequent HPV-related SPMs. The elevated risk is most striking in patients with second primary SCCAs; however, the risk of second cancers also appears to be increased in other HPV-related sites.

Impact of Recurrence and Salvage Surgery on Survival After Multidisciplinary Treatment of Rectal Cancer.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2017-06-28,"Purpose After preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision for locally advanced rectal cancer, patients who experience local or systemic relapse of disease may be eligible for curative salvage surgery, but the benefit of this surgery has not been fully investigated. The purpose of this study was to characterize recurrence patterns and investigate the impact of salvage surgery on survival in patients with rectal cancer after receiving multidisciplinary treatment. Patients and Methods Patients with locally advanced (cT3-4 or cN+) rectal cancer who were treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision at our institution during 1993 to 2008 were identified. We examined patterns of recurrence location, time to recurrence, treatment factors, and survival. Results A total of 735 patients were included. Tumors were mostly midrectal to lower rectal cancer, with a median distance from the anal verge of 5.0 cm. The most common recurrence site was the lung followed by the liver. Median time to recurrence was shorter in liver-only recurrence (11.2 months) than in lung-only recurrence (18.2 months) or locoregional-only recurrence (24.7 months; P = .001). Salvage surgery was performed in 57% of patients with single-site recurrence and was associated with longer survival after recurrence in patients with lung-only and liver-only recurrence ( P < .001) but not in those with locoregional-only recurrence ( P = .353).

Capecitabine With Mitomycin Reduces Acute Hematologic Toxicity and Treatment Delays in Patients Undergoing Definitive Chemoradiation Using Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy for Anal Cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2017-03-22,"To assess the impact on acute toxicity of replacing 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with capecitabine in definitive chemoradiation for patients with anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC). We retrospectively reviewed the records of 107 consecutive patients with nonmetastatic ASCC treated with definitive chemoradiation from January 2009 to May 2014. In 2011, based on the noninferiority of capecitabine versus 5-FU, our institutional practice shifted to use capecitabine instead of 5-FU for ASCC. Of 107 patients, 63 were treated with infusional 5-FU (1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day for 4 days) and mitomycin C (MMC) (10 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) during weeks 1 and 5, and 44 patients were treated with capecitabine (825 mg/m<sup>2</sup> twice daily) Monday through Friday throughout radiation therapy (RT) and MMC (10 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) during weeks 1 and 5. The incidence of grade 3 to 4 acute toxicity was compared between the 2 groups. The median age at diagnosis was 59 years, and 78 patients (73%) were female. The patient characteristics were similar between the 2 treatment groups. All patients in both groups were treated with intensity modulated RT (median dose, 56 Gy). In the 5-FU group, 52% experienced grade 3 to 4 neutropenia compared with 20% in the capecitabine group (P=.001). Treatment breaks resulting from toxicity, primarily related to grade 3+ hematologic toxicity, were necessary for 42% of patients treated with 5-FU versus 16% of those treated with capecitabine (P=.006).

Comprehensive Genomic Profiling of Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Anal Canal.,Molecular cancer research : MCR,Mol. Cancer Res.,2017-08-07,"Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCA) is a rare gastrointestinal malignancy with an increasing annual incidence globally. The majority of cases are linked to prior infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV). For patients with metastatic SCCA, no consensus standard treatment exists. Identification of relevant targeted agents as novel therapeutic approaches for metastatic SCCA has been limited by a lack of comprehensive molecular profiling. We performed whole-exome sequencing on tumor-normal pairs from 24 patients with metastatic SCCA. Tumor tissue from 17 additional patients was analyzed using a 263-gene panel as a validation cohort. Gene expression profiling was performed on available frozen tissue to assess for differential expression patterns. Based on these findings, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of SCCA were generated to test targeted therapies against PI3K and EGFR. Despite a low mutation burden, mutations in <i>PIK3CA, MLL2</i>, and <i>MLL3</i> were among the most commonly mutated genes. An association between <i>TP53</i> mutations and HPV-negative SCCA tumors was observed. Gene expression analysis suggested distinct tumor subpopulations harboring <i>PIK3CA</i> mutations and for which HPV had integrated into the host genome. <i>In vivo</i> studies demonstrated improvement with anti-EGFR treatment. Gene mutation frequencies, tumor mutation burden, and gene expression patterns for metastatic SCCA appear similar to other HPV-associated malignancies.<b>Implications:</b> This first comprehensive genomic characterization for patients with metastatic SCCA provides further rationale for the integration of SCCA into the development of novel targeted therapies across HPV-related cancers. <i>Mol Cancer Res; 15(11); 1542-50. ©2017 AACR</i>.",Journal Article,897.0,12.0,Squamous cell carcinoma of the canal SCCA is a rare malignancy with an increasing annual incidence globally The majority of cases are linked to prior infection with the human papillomavirus HPV For patients with metastatic SCCA no consensus standard treatment exists Identification of relevant targeted agents as novel therapeutic approaches for metastatic SCCA has been limited by a lack of comprehensive molecular profiling We performed whole-exome sequencing on tumor-normal pairs from 24 patients with metastatic SCCA Tumor tissue from 17 additional patients was analyzed using a 263-gene panel as a validation cohort Gene expression profiling was performed on available frozen tissue to assess for differential expression patterns Based on these findings patient-derived xenograft PDX models of SCCA were generated to test targeted therapies against PI3K and EGFR Despite a low mutation burden mutations in i PIK3CA MLL2 /i and i MLL3 /i were among the most commonly mutated genes An association between i TP53 /i mutations and HPV-negative SCCA tumors was observed Gene expression analysis suggested distinct tumor subpopulations harboring i PIK3CA /i mutations and for which HPV had integrated into the host genome i In vivo /i studies demonstrated improvement with anti-EGFR treatment Gene mutation frequencies tumor mutation burden and gene expression patterns for metastatic SCCA appear similar to other HPV-associated malignancies. b Implications /b This first comprehensive genomic characterization for patients with metastatic SCCA provides further rationale for the integration of SCCA into the development of novel targeted therapies across HPV-related cancers i Mol Cancer Res 15 11 1542-50 ©2017 AACR /i,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[691, 31, 134, 1, 3, 5614, 6372, 16, 8, 622, 710, 5, 35, 602, 2114, 287, 6873, 3, 686, 1, 140, 32, 1199, 6, 324, 930, 5, 3, 171, 3242, 933, 9, 7, 5, 113, 6372, 77, 1391, 260, 24, 2481, 911, 1, 867, 238, 183, 22, 229, 189, 611, 9, 113, 6372, 71, 85, 383, 20, 8, 926, 1, 949, 219, 1080, 21, 173, 902, 2865, 615, 23, 30, 295, 2773, 29, 259, 7, 5, 113, 6372, 30, 246, 29, 269, 402, 7, 10, 311, 75, 8, 6098, 145, 993, 22, 8, 929, 180, 145, 55, 1080, 10, 173, 23, 390, 3015, 246, 6, 423, 9, 1777, 55, 764, 90, 23, 46, 272, 69, 526, 1330, 3250, 274, 1, 6372, 11, 1419, 6, 412, 238, 235, 480, 974, 2, 227, 550, 8, 154, 258, 892, 138, 4, 70, 1506, 11711, 70, 2, 70, 13433, 70, 11, 107, 3, 96, 841, 1185, 214, 35, 248, 59, 70, 1206, 70, 138, 2, 933, 199, 6372, 57, 10, 164, 145, 55, 65, 1148, 834, 30, 4847, 2105, 70, 1506, 70, 138, 2, 9, 92, 933, 42, 2102, 237, 3, 1204, 898, 70, 4, 386, 70, 94, 264, 767, 5, 312, 227, 24, 145, 258, 2722, 30, 258, 892, 2, 145, 55, 764, 9, 113, 6372, 1322, 288, 6, 127, 933, 41, 441, 132, 1268, 132, 26, 157, 949, 572, 2136, 9, 7, 5, 113, 6372, 777, 195, 1728, 9, 3, 2676, 1, 6372, 237, 3, 193, 1, 229, 238, 235, 716, 933, 139, 163, 70, 5824, 12, 1936, 167, 175, 50520, 212, 3194, 1630, 70]",1720.0,28784613,6

The aim of this study was to analyze long-term outcomes of surgically treated patients with SCC liver metastases. The clinicopathological characteristics, overall survival (OS), and recurrence free survival (RFS) of all patients with SCC liver metastases resected between 1998 and 2015, were analyzed. Among 28 patients who met inclusion criteria, there were 19 patients with anal cancer metastases (68%), 2 (7%) with cervix cancer metastases, 2 (7%) with tonsil cancer metastases, 2 (7%) with lung cancer metastases, 2 (7%) with primary unknown cancer metastases and 1 (4%) with vulvar cancer metastases.

Little is known about the outcome for rectal GIST in the era of imatinib. Using a prospectively maintained database, this study retrospectively analyzed 47 localized primary rectal GISTs treated at our center from 1982 to 2016, stratified by when imatinib became available in 2000. Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Rectal GISTs represented 7.1% of 663 primary GISTs. The findings showed 17 patients in the pre-imatinib era and 30 patients in the imatinib era. The two groups had similar follow-up evaluation, age, gender, Miettinen risk, and distance to the anal verge. In the imatinib era, tumors were smaller at diagnosis (median 4 vs. 5 cm; p = 0.029), and 24 of the 30 patients received perioperative imatinib. In the high-risk patients, organ preservation and negative margins were more common among the 13 patients treated with neoadjuvant imatinib than among the 21 patients treated directly with surgery.

Effect of CD4 Count on Treatment Toxicity and Tumor Recurrence in Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Positive Patients With Anal Cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2017-09-22,"To study the effects of immunosuppression on treatment toxicity, long-term cancer recurrence risk, and survival among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive anal cancer patients. From a nationwide retrospective cohort of veterans with anal cancer we identified 142 HIV-positive patients with stage I-III disease, diagnosed between 2000 and 2015 and treated with definitive-intent chemotherapy and radiation. We used regression models to study the impact of pretreatment CD4 counts and longitudinal posttreatment CD4 counts on outcomes including acute toxicity, long-term ostomy rates, cancer recurrence, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival. All models were adjusted for potential confounders. The median pretreatment CD4 count was 375 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, which dropped to 157 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> after treatment. Each 100-cell/mm<sup>3</sup> decrease in pretreatment CD4 count was associated with an increased risk of acute hematologic toxicity (odds ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.42, P=.04) and hospitalization for hematologic toxicity (odds ratio 1.24, 95% CI 1.00-1.54, P=.049) but not gastrointestinal toxicity, tumor recurrence, or cancer-specific mortality (P>.05). Each 100-cells/mm<sup>3</sup> decrease in posttreatment CD4 count increased the risk of recurrence by 54% (hazard ratio 1.54, 95% CI 1.09-2.17, P=.01) and cancer mortality by 46% at a trend level (hazard ratio 1.46, 95% CI 0.99-2.14, P=.06). Neither pre- nor posttreatment CD4 count influenced long-term ostomy rates or overall survival (all P>.05). Lower pretreatment CD4 counts were associated with acute hematologic toxicity, and lower posttreatment CD4 count levels were associated with an increased risk of tumor recurrence. These results suggest that immune surveillance may play an important role in long-term disease control in anal cancer.",Journal Article,851.0,6.0,To study the effects of immunosuppression on treatment toxicity long-term cancer recurrence risk and survival among human immunodeficiency virus HIV -positive cancer patients From a nationwide retrospective cohort of veterans with cancer we identified 142 HIV-positive patients with stage I-III disease diagnosed between 2000 and 2015 and treated with definitive-intent chemotherapy and radiation We used regression models to study the impact of pretreatment CD4 counts and longitudinal posttreatment CD4 counts on outcomes including acute toxicity long-term ostomy rates cancer recurrence cancer-specific survival and overall survival All models were adjusted for potential confounders The median pretreatment CD4 count was 375 cells/mm sup 3 /sup which dropped to 157 cells/mm sup 3 /sup after treatment Each 100-cell/mm sup 3 /sup decrease in pretreatment CD4 count was associated with an increased risk of acute hematologic toxicity odds ratio 1.19 95 confidence interval CI 1.01-1.42 P=.04 and hospitalization for hematologic toxicity odds ratio 1.24 95 CI 1.00-1.54 P=.049 but not toxicity tumor recurrence or cancer-specific mortality P .05 Each 100-cells/mm sup 3 /sup decrease in posttreatment CD4 count increased the risk of recurrence by 54 hazard ratio 1.54 95 CI 1.09-2.17 P=.01 and cancer mortality by 46 at a trend level hazard ratio 1.46 95 CI 0.99-2.14 P=.06 Neither pre- nor posttreatment CD4 count influenced long-term ostomy rates or overall survival all P .05 Lower pretreatment CD4 counts were associated with acute hematologic toxicity and lower posttreatment CD4 count levels were associated with an increased risk of tumor recurrence These results suggest that immune surveillance may play an important role in long-term disease control in cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 45, 3, 176, 1, 3646, 23, 24, 155, 319, 337, 12, 146, 43, 2, 25, 107, 171, 5323, 1450, 1942, 109, 12, 7, 29, 8, 5405, 459, 180, 1, 7707, 5, 12, 21, 108, 4785, 1942, 109, 7, 5, 82, 70, 316, 34, 265, 59, 1081, 2, 1483, 2, 73, 5, 1057, 1697, 56, 2, 121, 21, 95, 320, 274, 6, 45, 3, 345, 1, 1194, 1440, 1911, 2, 2380, 3149, 1440, 1911, 23, 123, 141, 286, 155, 319, 337, 15565, 151, 12, 146, 12, 112, 25, 2, 63, 25, 62, 274, 11, 586, 9, 174, 4423, 3, 52, 1194, 1440, 1276, 10, 4175, 37, 321, 172, 27, 172, 92, 8801, 6, 5311, 37, 321, 172, 27, 172, 50, 24, 296, 394, 31, 321, 172, 27, 172, 775, 4, 1194, 1440, 1276, 10, 41, 5, 35, 101, 43, 1, 286, 813, 155, 610, 197, 14, 326, 48, 307, 268, 58, 14, 355, 14, 595, 19, 755, 2, 2826, 9, 813, 155, 610, 197, 14, 259, 48, 58, 14, 2038, 14, 667, 19, 5121, 84, 44, 155, 30, 146, 15, 12, 112, 282, 19, 474, 296, 394, 37, 321, 172, 27, 172, 775, 4, 3149, 1440, 1276, 101, 3, 43, 1, 146, 20, 667, 360, 197, 14, 667, 48, 58, 14, 1730, 18, 269, 19, 355, 2, 12, 282, 20, 641, 28, 8, 853, 301, 360, 197, 14, 641, 48, 58, 13, 1058, 18, 213, 19, 1460, 2174, 671, 2110, 3149, 1440, 1276, 2574, 319, 337, 15565, 151, 15, 63, 25, 62, 19, 474, 280, 1194, 1440, 1911, 11, 41, 5, 286, 813, 155, 2, 280, 3149, 1440, 1276, 148, 11, 41, 5, 35, 101, 43, 1, 30, 146, 46, 99, 309, 17, 250, 617, 68, 1343, 35, 305, 200, 4, 319, 337, 34, 182, 4, 12]",1771.0,29102276,64
The promise of immunotherapy in anal squamous cell carcinoma: a novel approach for an orphan disease.,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,2017-12-01,"An estimated 8200 men and women in the United States will receive a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCA) in 2017. Although SCCA is rare, accounting for 2.6% of gastrointestinal cancers, its incidence rate has been steadily increasing over the last few decades in the United States and around the world. More than 90% of cases of SCCA occur in the context of prior human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. To date, preventive vaccinations against HPV remain markedly underutilized. Most patients who have SCCA present with locoregional disease that is cured with chemoradiation. However, metastatic disease develops in 25% of patients. The management of metastatic SCCA is based on single-institutional case series, with no accepted consensus regarding standard of care. Given the complex interplay between the incorporation of HPV DNA into the host cell genome and the oncogenesis of SCCA, immunotherapeutic strategies have become a strong focus of research efforts regarding the management of SCCA.

Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agent During Pelvic MRI: Contribution to Patient Management in Rectal Cancer.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2018-02-01,"Few publications exist regarding gadolinium-enhanced sequences in rectal MRI. None have evaluated its potential impact on patient management. This study aimed to assess whether gadolinium-enhanced sequences, including dynamic contrast enhancement, change radiologic interpretation and clinical management of rectal cancer. This is a retrospective analysis of 100 rectal MRIs (50 baseline and 50 postneoadjuvant treatment), both without and with gadolinium-enhanced sequences. Treatment plans were rendered based on each radiologic interpretation for each case by a single experienced surgeon. Differences in radiologic interpretation and management were statistically analyzed. The study was conducted at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Patients undergoing rectal MRI between 2011 and 2015 for baseline tumor staging and/or postneoadjuvant restaging were included. Primary outcome measures were changes in radiologic tumor stage, tumor margins, and surgical planning with the use of gadolinium at baseline and postneoadjuvant time points. At baseline, tumor downstaging occurred in 8 (16%) of 50 and upstaging in 4 (8%) of 50 with gadolinium. Postneoadjuvant treatment, upstaging occurred in 1 (2%) of 50 from T2 to T3a. At baseline, mean distances from tumor to anorectal ring, anal verge, and mesorectal fascia were not statistically different with gadolinium. However, in 7 patients, differences could have resulted in treatment changes, accounted for by changes in relationships to anterior peritoneal reflection (n = 4), anorectal ring (n = 2), or anal verge (n = 1). Postneoadjuvant treatment, distances to anorectal ring and anal verge (in centimeters) were statistically smaller with gadolinium (p = 0.0017 and p = 0.0151) but could not have resulted in clinically significant treatment changes. This study was limited by its retrospective design. The use of gadolinium at baseline MRI could have altered treatment in 24% of patients because of differences in tumor stage or position.

Hybrid Capture-Based Genomic Profiling of Circulating Tumor DNA from Patients with Advanced Cancers of the Gastrointestinal Tract or Anus.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2018-01-23,"<b>Purpose:</b> Genomic profiling of tumor biopsies from advanced gastrointestinal and anal cancers is increasingly used to inform treatment. In some cases, tissue biopsy can be prohibitive, and we sought to investigate whether analysis of blood-derived circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) may provide a minimally invasive alternative.<b>Experimental Design:</b> Hybrid capture-based genomic profiling of 62 genes was performed on blood-based ctDNA from 417 patients with gastrointestinal carcinomas to assess the presence of genomic alterations (GA) and compare with matched tissue samples.<b>Results:</b> Evidence of ctDNA was detected in 344 of 417 samples (82%), and of these, ≥1 reportable GA was detected in 89% (306/344) of samples. Frequently altered genes were <i>TP53</i> (72%), <i>KRAS</i> (35%), <i>PIK3CA</i> (14%), <i>BRAF</i> (8%), and <i>EGFR</i> (7%). In temporally matched ctDNA and tissue samples available from 25 patients, 86% of alterations detected in tissue were also detected in ctDNA, including 95% of short variants, but only 50% of amplifications. Conversely, 63% of alterations detected in ctDNA were also detected in matched tissue. Examples demonstrating clinical utility are presented.<b>Conclusions:</b> Genomic profiling of ctDNA detected potentially clinically relevant GAs in a significant subset of patients with gastrointestinal carcinomas. In these tumor types, most alterations detected in matched tissue were also detected in ctDNA, and with the exception of amplifications, ctDNA sequencing routinely detected additional alterations not found in matched tissue, consistent with tumor heterogeneity. These results suggest feasibility and utility of ctDNA testing in advanced gastrointestinal cancers as a complementary approach to tissue testing, and further investigation is warranted. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 24(8); 1881-90. ©2018 AACR</i>.",Journal Article,728.0,21.0,b Purpose /b Genomic profiling of tumor biopsies from advanced and cancers is increasingly used to inform treatment In some cases tissue biopsy can be prohibitive and we sought to investigate whether analysis of blood-derived circulating tumor DNA ctDNA may provide a minimally invasive alternative. b Experimental Design /b Hybrid capture-based genomic profiling of 62 genes was performed on blood-based ctDNA from 417 patients with carcinomas to assess the presence of genomic alterations GA and compare with matched tissue samples. b Results /b Evidence of ctDNA was detected in 344 of 417 samples 82 and of these ≥1 reportable GA was detected in 89 306/344 of samples Frequently altered genes were i TP53 /i 72 i KRAS /i 35 i PIK3CA /i 14 i BRAF /i 8 and i EGFR /i 7 In temporally matched ctDNA and tissue samples available from 25 patients 86 of alterations detected in tissue were also detected in ctDNA including 95 of short variants but only 50 of amplifications Conversely 63 of alterations detected in ctDNA were also detected in matched tissue Examples demonstrating clinical utility are presented. b Conclusions /b Genomic profiling of ctDNA detected potentially clinically relevant GAs in a significant subset of patients with carcinomas In these tumor types most alterations detected in matched tissue were also detected in ctDNA and with the exception of amplifications ctDNA sequencing routinely detected additional alterations not found in matched tissue consistent with tumor heterogeneity These results suggest feasibility and utility of ctDNA testing in advanced cancers as a complementary approach to tissue testing and further investigation is warranted i Clin Cancer Res 24 8 1881-90 ©2018 AACR /i,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[132, 743, 132, 572, 1080, 1, 30, 1154, 29, 131, 2, 163, 16, 1635, 95, 6, 2295, 24, 4, 476, 140, 246, 411, 122, 40, 10784, 2, 21, 990, 6, 963, 317, 65, 1, 315, 526, 1033, 30, 261, 3356, 68, 377, 8, 2144, 416, 1091, 132, 1560, 771, 132, 4542, 2891, 90, 572, 1080, 1, 744, 214, 10, 173, 23, 315, 90, 3356, 29, 9947, 7, 5, 826, 6, 423, 3, 463, 1, 572, 593, 3414, 2, 932, 5, 655, 246, 347, 132, 99, 132, 241, 1, 3356, 10, 530, 4, 6993, 1, 9947, 347, 878, 2, 1, 46, 3567, 29501, 3414, 10, 530, 4, 887, 9974, 6993, 1, 347, 746, 1495, 214, 11, 70, 1206, 70, 720, 70, 723, 70, 465, 70, 1506, 70, 213, 70, 566, 70, 66, 2, 70, 227, 70, 67, 4, 11114, 655, 3356, 2, 246, 347, 390, 29, 243, 7, 868, 1, 593, 530, 4, 246, 11, 120, 530, 4, 3356, 141, 48, 1, 978, 839, 84, 158, 212, 1, 4877, 3154, 676, 1, 593, 530, 4, 3356, 11, 120, 530, 4, 655, 246, 4416, 2219, 38, 1207, 32, 917, 132, 2130, 132, 572, 1080, 1, 3356, 530, 751, 505, 867, 5577, 4, 8, 93, 697, 1, 7, 5, 826, 4, 46, 30, 630, 96, 593, 530, 4, 655, 246, 11, 120, 530, 4, 3356, 2, 5, 3, 4188, 1, 4877, 3356, 615, 3066, 530, 402, 593, 44, 204, 4, 655, 246, 925, 5, 30, 1144, 46, 99, 309, 1437, 2, 1207, 1, 3356, 471, 4, 131, 163, 22, 8, 3380, 353, 6, 246, 471, 2, 195, 940, 16, 1197, 70, 2459, 12, 1936, 259, 66, 40941, 424, 4281, 1630, 70]",1720.0,29363525,12
Pathologic response following treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer: Does location matter?,The Journal of surgical research,J. Surg. Res.,2018-01-04,"Despite advances in the treatment of rectal adenocarcinoma, the management of locally advanced disease remains a challenge. The standard of care for patients with stages II and III rectal cancer includes neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by total mesorectal excision and postoperative chemotherapy. Much effort has been dedicated to the identification of predictive factors associated with pathologic complete response (pCR). The aim of our study was to examine our institutional experience and determine whether any association exists between anatomic tumor location and the rate of pCR. We hypothesized that lesions more than 6 cm from the anal verge are more likely to achieve a pCR. Using data from our prospectively maintained tumor registry, a query was completed to identify all patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent treatment at Fox Chase Cancer Center from 2002 to 2015. Demographics, pretreatment, posttreatment, and final pathologic TNM staging data were collected as well as treatment intervals in days, recurrence status, overall survival, and disease-free survival. Patients with incomplete endoscopic data, staging information, survival, or recurrence status were excluded. The primary outcome measured was the degree of pathologic response. Logistic regression was used to adjust for covariates. Of the 135 patients eligible in the study cohort, 39% were female and 61% were male. Regarding initial clinical stage, 43% were stage II and 57% were stage III. A total of 29% had a pCR, 43% had partial pathologic response, and 28% had no response to neoadjuvant treatment. Tumor location ranged from 0 to 13 cm from the anal verge. Longitudinal tumor length was recorded in 111 patients, facilitating the calculation of mean tumor distance from the anal verge. This ranged from 0 to 15.5 cm. Univariate and multivariable analyses were completed using pCR as a primary outcome. No statistically significant difference was noted based on tumor location, regardless of measurement approach.

"Landscape of Tumor Mutation Load, Mismatch Repair Deficiency, and PD-L1 Expression in a Large Patient Cohort of Gastrointestinal Cancers.",Molecular cancer research : MCR,Mol. Cancer Res.,2018-03-09,"The efficacy of immunotherapy varies widely among different gastrointestinal cancers. Response to immune checkpoint inhibitors is shown to correlate with tumor mutation load (TML), mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) status, and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Herein, we quantify TML, dMMR, and PD-L1 expression and determine their interrelationship in gastrointestinal cancers. Here, a total of 4,125 tumors from 14 different gastrointestinal cancer sites were studied using validated assays. Next-generation sequencing was performed on genomic DNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor specimens using the NextSeq platform. TML was calculated using only somatic nonsynonymous missense mutations sequenced with a 592-gene panel. Microsatellite instability (MSI) was assessed using direct analysis of altered known MSI loci in the target regions of the sequenced genes. PD-L1 expression was analyzed by IHC. Interestingly, right-sided colon and small-bowel adenocarcinomas had the highest prevalence of TML-high tumors (14.6% and 10.2%, respectively). Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and gastrointestinal stromal tumors had the lowest rates of TML-high (1.3% and 0%, respectively). TML-high was strongly associated with MSI-H (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). However, all TML-high anal cancers (8.3%) were microsatellite stable (MSS).

This was a retrospective review of patients with SCC of the anal canal metastatic to the PA lymph nodes at initial diagnosis who were treated with curative-intent, extended-field chemoradiation therapy between September 2002 and February 2016 at two tertiary care centers. Outcomes assessed included treatment-related AEs (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0), disease control (cumulative incidence estimates), and survival (Kaplan-Meier estimates). Thirty patients were included. Involved and elective PA nodes were treated to median doses of 51 Gy (range 45-57.6) and 45 Gy (range 30.6-50.4) in 29 fractions (range 17-32). All patients received one of these concomitant regimens: 6 weekly cycles of cisplatin with 5-fluoruracil/capecitabine (5-FU) (n = 22), 2 cycles of mitomycin-C with 5-FU (n = 7), or daily capecitabine (n = 1). After a median follow-up period of 3.1 years, 18 patients (60%) remained alive and 17 patients were without evidence of anal cancer after definite and salvage treatments.

Resection of a Perirectal Leiomyosarcoma via a Posterior Transcoccygeal Approach.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2018-07-06,"The management of perirectal tumors often requires rectal wall resection, and sometimes a complete proctectomy is required. Access to posterior perirectal masses via a posterior, transcoccygeal approach (Kraske procedure) avoids dissection of the intraperitoneal rectum. The patient was a 63-year-old male who presented to his primary care physician with debilitating perirectal pain of several months' duration. He did not respond to therapy with pain medications and topical agents, and underwent a lateral internal sphincterotomy for what was thought to be an anal fissure, without relief prior to referral. Diagnostic workup showed a low signal intensity mass on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and biopsy revealed high-grade leiomyosarcoma with myxoid features. Staging workup included a contrast-enhanced computed tomography chest, abdomen and pelvis, flexible sigmoidoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound. A lytic lesion in his left ilium on MRI was found to be avid on fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scan and was therefore consistent with oligometastatic disease. He received six cycles of adriamycin, cyclophosphamide and dacarbazine, with good response. The metastatic lesion was treated with 24 Gy of radiotherapy, while the primary tumor was treated with 50 Gy of radiotherapy. The patient underwent the Kraske approach with radical resection of the perirectal mass.

Surg.,2019-04-01,"To determine the disease-free survival (DFS) and recurrence after the treatment of patients with rectal cancer with open (OPEN) or laparoscopic (LAP) resection. This randomized clinical trial (ACOSOG [Alliance] Z6051), performed between 2008 and 2013, compared LAP and OPEN resection of stage II/III rectal cancer, within 12 cm of the anal verge (T1-3, N0-2, M0) in patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The rectum and mesorectum were resected using open instruments for rectal dissection (included hybrid hand-assisted laparoscopic) or with laparoscopic instruments under pneumoperitoneum. The 2-year DFS and recurrence were secondary endpoints of Z6051. The DFS and recurrence were not powered, and are being assessed for superiority. Recurrence was determined at 3, 6, 9, 12, and every 6 months thereafter, using carcinoembryonic antigen, physical examination, computed tomography, and colonoscopy.

Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy Versus Conventional Radiation for Anal Cancer in the Veterans Affairs System.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2018-05-23,"Compared with conventional radiation therapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) may reduce acute toxicity from anal cancer treatment, potentially leading to improved long-term outcomes. We analyze the effect of IMRT on short- and long-term outcomes among a large sample of US veterans. From a national Veterans Affairs database, we identified 779 patients (n = 403 conventional radiation therapy, n = 376 IMRT) with locally advanced anal squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed between 2000 and 2015 and treated with concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Radiation treatment planning and dosimetric constraints were not standardized across patients. We analyzed the effect of IMRT on short-term outcomes (acute toxicity, treatment breaks, and incomplete chemotherapy) and long-term outcomes (survival and ostomy placement) in multivariable logistic regression, Fine-Gray, and frailty models, adjusting for potential confounders. IMRT was associated with decreased radiation treatment breaks ≥5 days (odds ratio [OR] 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.91; P = .02), increased rates of receiving 2 cycles of mitomycin C chemotherapy (OR 2.04; 95% CI 1.22-3.45; P = .007), increased rates of receiving 2 cycles of any chemotherapy (OR 3.45; 95% CI 1.82-6.25; P < .001), and decreased risk of ostomy related to tumor recurrence or progression (subdistribution hazard ratio 0.60; 95% CI 0.37-0.99; P = .045).

Role of Neoadjuvant Radio-chemotherapy for the Treatment of High Rectal Cancer.,Anticancer research,Anticancer Res.,2018-09-01,"Controversy exists regarding treatment of high rectal cancer. The role of neoadjuvant radio-chemotherapy was investigated. Fifty-four patients receiving neoadjuvant radio-chemotherapy (50.4 Gy & 2 courses of concurrent chemotherapy) for stage II/III high rectal cancer (10.1-15.0 cm from anal verge) were retrospectively analyzed. Following microscopicallly complete resection of primary tumor and involved lymph nodes in all patients, ≤6 courses of chemotherapy were given. Five-year rates of local control (LC), metastases-free survival (MFS) and overall survival (OS) were 90%, 79% and 77%. On multivariate analyses, LC was associated with lower pathological UICC-stage at surgery (p=0.003) and successful downstaging (p=0.007), MFS with higher regression grade (p=0.014) and OS with lower Union for International Cancer Control (UICC)-stage (p=0.017) and downstaging (p=0.034).

Facilitators of and barriers to high-resolution anoscopy adherence among men who have sex with men: a qualitative study.,Sexual health,Sex Health,2018-11-01,"Background Anal cancer is a rare malignancy that disproportionately affects men who have sex with men (MSM) and HIV-infected people. Anal cancer is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) in upward of 90% of cases and is preceded by pre-cancerous changes in cells of the anal canal. High-resolution anoscopy (HRA) is used for the detection, treatment and continued monitoring of anal dysplasia. Practice guidelines regarding anal cancer prevention vary by jurisdiction and institution, and patient engagement is low for high-risk populations such as MSM. The purpose of this study is to characterise perceptions among MSM of barriers to and facilitators of their adherence to HRA follow-up recommendations. Surveys and in-person focus groups with MSM who were either adherent or non-adherent to HRA follow-up recommendations at a Federally Qualified Health Centre in Boston, MA, which specialises in sexual and gender minority care, were conducted. Facilitators of and barriers to follow-up were identified by deductive content analysis. Focus group participants identified the following barriers to and facilitators of HRA follow up: (1) patient-level beliefs about HPV-related disease or HRA, ability to engage in care, internalised stigma and physical discomfort; (2) provider-level knowledge and expertise, communication skills and relationship-building with patient; and (3) systems-level societal stigma and healthcare system inefficiencies. Reinforcing facilitators of and reducing barriers to HRA follow up may improve adherence among MSM. This includes improvements to: patient education, provider training to increase knowledge and cultural sensitivity, public awareness about HPV-related anal cancer, physical discomfort associated with HRA and systems inefficiencies.",Journal Article,446.0,0.0,Background cancer is a rare malignancy that disproportionately affects men who have sex with men MSM and HIV-infected people cancer is associated with human papillomavirus HPV in upward of 90 of cases and is preceded by pre-cancerous changes in cells of the canal High-resolution anoscopy HRA is used for the detection treatment and continued monitoring of dysplasia Practice guidelines regarding cancer prevention vary by jurisdiction and institution and patient engagement is low for high-risk populations such as MSM The purpose of this study is to characterise perceptions among MSM of barriers to and facilitators of their adherence to HRA follow-up recommendations Surveys and in-person focus groups with MSM who were either adherent or non-adherent to HRA follow-up recommendations at a Federally Qualified Health Centre in Boston MA which specialises in sexual and gender minority care were conducted Facilitators of and barriers to follow-up were identified by deductive content analysis Focus group participants identified the following barriers to and facilitators of HRA follow up 1 patient-level beliefs about HPV-related disease or HRA ability to engage in care internalised stigma and physical discomfort 2 provider-level knowledge and expertise communication skills and relationship-building with patient and 3 systems-level societal stigma and healthcare system inefficiencies Reinforcing facilitators of and reducing barriers to HRA follow up may improve adherence among MSM This includes improvements to patient education provider training to increase knowledge and cultural sensitivity public awareness about HPV-related cancer physical discomfort associated with HRA and systems inefficiencies,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2426, 12, 16, 8, 622, 710, 17, 10094, 2561, 325, 54, 47, 1035, 5, 325, 20869, 2, 1942, 3369, 3788, 12, 16, 41, 5, 171, 3242, 933, 4, 21032, 1, 424, 1, 140, 2, 16, 6083, 20, 671, 5483, 400, 4, 37, 1, 3, 5614, 64, 2125, 21979, 20959, 16, 95, 9, 3, 638, 24, 2, 1351, 1315, 1, 2253, 758, 677, 666, 12, 1070, 2825, 20, 73639, 2, 731, 2, 69, 5103, 16, 154, 9, 64, 43, 1184, 225, 22, 20869, 3, 743, 1, 26, 45, 16, 6, 16885, 3746, 107, 20869, 1, 2160, 6, 2, 16117, 1, 136, 2149, 6, 20959, 166, 126, 883, 3666, 2, 4, 2719, 1222, 271, 5, 20869, 54, 11, 361, 7010, 15, 220, 7010, 6, 20959, 166, 126, 883, 28, 8, 22523, 9575, 341, 5931, 4, 7026, 3687, 92, 73640, 4, 2232, 2, 1632, 2652, 165, 11, 426, 16117, 1, 2, 2160, 6, 166, 126, 11, 108, 20, 42016, 2457, 65, 1222, 87, 776, 108, 3, 366, 2160, 6, 2, 16117, 1, 20959, 166, 126, 14, 69, 301, 5059, 545, 933, 139, 34, 15, 20959, 801, 6, 7430, 4, 165, 73641, 14019, 2, 900, 7381, 18, 3094, 301, 922, 2, 4935, 2063, 5909, 2, 858, 5808, 5, 69, 2, 27, 1530, 301, 9378, 14019, 2, 2819, 398, 25528, 18356, 16117, 1, 2, 1818, 2160, 6, 20959, 166, 126, 68, 401, 2149, 107, 20869, 26, 1920, 1474, 6, 69, 1848, 3094, 1741, 6, 344, 922, 2, 8587, 485, 3067, 3310, 545, 933, 139, 12, 900, 7381, 41, 5, 20959, 2, 1530, 25528]",1714.0,30244691,11

Trends in Risks for Second Primary Cancers Associated With Index Human Papillomavirus-Associated Cancers.,JAMA network open,JAMA Netw Open,2018-09-07,"In the last 4 decades, survival among patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers has improved, while the incidence of these cancers has increased among younger cohorts. Among survivors of HPV-associated cancers, persistent HPV infection may remain a risk factor for preventable HPV-associated second primary cancers (HPV-SPCs). To investigate the risk of HPV-SPCs among survivors of HPV-associated index cancers and to test the hypothesis that the HPV-SPC risk among these persons has increased over the last 4 decades. A retrospective cohort study of 9 cancer registries of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was conducted to identify patients with HPV-associated (cervical, vaginal, vulvar, oropharyngeal, anal, and penile) cancers diagnosed from January 1, 1973, through December 31, 2014. The dates of analysis were July 1, 2017, to January 31, 2018. The HPV-SPC risk was quantified by calculating standard incidence ratios (SIRs) and excess absolute risks (EARs) per 10 000 person-years at risk (PYR). The HPV-SPC risk by time was estimated using Poisson regression. From 113 272 (73 085 female and 40 187 male) survivors of HPV-associated cancers, 1397 women and 1098 men developed HPV-SPCs. The SIRs for HPV-SPCs were 6.2 (95% CI, 5.9-6.6) among women and 15.8 (95% CI, 14.9-16.8) among men. The EARs were 18.2 per 10 000 PYR for women and 53.5 per 10 000 PYR for men. Among both women and men, those who had index oropharyngeal cancers had the highest HPV-SPC risk (SIR, 19.8 [95% CI, 18.4-21.4] and EAR, 80.6 per 10 000 PYR among women; SIR, 18.0 [95% CI, 16.9-19.1] and EAR, 61.5 per 10 000 PYR among men). Women who had index cervical cancers and men who had index anal cancers had the lowest HPV-SPC risk (SIR, 2.4 [95% CI, 2.2-2.7] and EAR, 4.5 per 10 000 PYR among women; SIR, 6.5 [95% CI, 4.7-8.8] and EAR, 18.5 per 10 000 PYR among men). Both women and men who had index HPV-associated cancers of any kind had a significantly higher risk of oropharyngeal HPV-SPCs.

Anal Cancer in the Era of Dose Painted Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy: Implications for Regional Nodal Therapy.,Seminars in radiation oncology,Semin Radiat Oncol,2019-04-01,"Since the initial development of 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin as a standard of care platform for definitive anal cancer chemoradiotherapy, multiple studies have evaluated the optimal chemotherapy regimen, and radiotherapy technique. Refinements in treatment technique have taken place during an era of improved diagnostic imaging, including incorporation of FDG-PET, with implications for a possible stage migration effect. This has introduced an opportunity to develop stage-specific recommendations for primary tumor, involved nodal, and elective nodal irradiation dose. Elective nodal irradiation remains standard given the low rates of elective nodal failure with current practice, although may be subject to evolving controversy for patients with early stage disease.

In this cross-sectional study, participants underwent anal cytology, anal HPV testing with Cervista HPV16/18 and high-resolution anoscopy (HRA). Patients with HSIL (high-grade squamous cell intraepithelial lesion) or greater on anal cytology or anal biopsy were referred to a colorectal surgery specialist for further evaluation. Seventy-five women were enrolled in the study, including 47 with cervical (cervix group), 10 with vaginal (vagina group), 15 with vulvar (vulva group), 1 with cervical and vaginal, and 2 with vulvar and vaginal disease. The median age in the cervix group (40 years (range 26-69)) was substantially younger than in the vagina (60 years (38-69)) and the vulva (59 years (36-75)) groups. Anal HSIL based on composite endpoints of the most severe cytology or histology result was diagnosed in 6 patients (8.0%). Anal cytology revealed HSIL in 2 (2.7%), atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) in 12 (16.0%), low-grade squamous cell intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) in 2 (2.7%), and was normal in 59 (78.7%) patients.

Role of the Interval from Completion of Neoadjuvant Therapy to Surgery in Postoperative Morbidity in Patients with Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2019-04-08,"Increasing the interval from completion of neoadjuvant therapy to surgery beyond 8 weeks is associated with increased response of rectal cancer to neoadjuvant therapy. However, reports are conflicting on whether extending the time to surgery is associated with increased perioperative morbidity. Patients who presented with a tumor within 15 cm of the anal verge in 2009-2015 were grouped according to the interval between completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery: < 8 weeks, 8-12 weeks, and 12-16 weeks. Among 607 patients, the surgery was performed at < 8 weeks in 317 patients, 8-12 weeks in 229 patients, and 12-16 weeks in 61 patients. Patients who underwent surgery at 8-12 weeks and patients who underwent surgery at < 8 weeks had comparable rates of complications (37% and 44%, respectively). Univariable analysis identified male sex, earlier date of diagnosis, tumor location within 5 cm of the anal verge, open operative approach, abdominoperineal resection, and use of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy alone to be associated with higher rates of complications. In multivariable analysis, male sex, tumor location within 5 cm of the anal verge, open operative approach, and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy administered alone were independently associated with the presence of a complication.

The Management and Prevention of Anal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book. American Society of Clinical Oncology. Annual Meeting,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,2019-05-17,"Our aim is to discuss the current established management of care and associated prevention strategies of anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA). In general, the development of SCCA is commonly linked to a prior history of HPV. Unfortunately, HPV vaccination continues to be underutilized in the United States versus other countries. Increased acknowledgment of the importance of HPV vaccination as an anticancer vaccine should be encouraged. The present standard of care is primary chemoradiotherapy (CRT), which results in a high level of disease control for small, early-stage SCCA. More advanced cancers still fare poorly with this treatment, and the disease relapses locoregionally in the majority of cases (30%-50% of patients), resulting in an abdominoperineal resection. Current treatment recommendations are associated with substantial morbidity; alternative radiation doses and/or novel combinations of agents with CRT are needed to improve quality of life and oncologic outcomes. Cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the standard of care for treatment-naïve patients with metastatic disease, with a possible new treatment paradigm of carboplatin/weekly paclitaxel. In addition, immune checkpoint inhibition appears to have a promising role in the setting of patients with refractory disease. Several clinical trials with immunotherapeutic and vaccine approaches for locally advanced and metastatic anal cancer are ongoing, as are HPV-agnostic umbrella trials.

The Pelvis-First Approach for Robotic Proctectomy in Patients with Redundant Abdominal Colon.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2019-05-17,"Robotic surgery is increasingly performed for low rectal cancer.1 A redundant sigmoid colon makes retraction and pelvic dissection challenging. We present a 'pelvis-first' approach to robotic proctectomy where pelvic dissection occurs prior to colonic mobilization. A 26-year-old woman was diagnosed with a clinical T3N1 rectal adenocarcinoma at 3 cm from the anal verge. The patient had Lynch syndrome, with a germline mutation in the PMS2 gene. A near-complete clinical response was observed after neoadjuvant chemoradiation (NCRT), and the patient wished to delay surgery and permanent colostomy. Additional FOLFOX was administered and led to a complete clinical response. After 2.5 months of watchful delay of surgery, the tumor regrew, and the patient then underwent robotic abdominoperineal resection (APR). Initial exploration revealed a highly redundant sigmoid colon. A pelvis-first approach was undertaken. The colon was left tethered and outside of the pelvis during the pelvic dissection. The levator ani was divided transabdominally. Vascular dissection and left colon mobilization were completed after pelvic dissection.2 The specimen was removed transanally, obviating the need for abdominal incision. An end colostomy was created laparoscopically, and the perineum was closed primarily after omental flap. The patient recovered without complications. The 'pelvis-first' approach to proctectomy is advantageous for patients with a highly redundant sigmoid colon. Transabdominal division of the levator ani during APR ensures excellent circumferential margin. Although Lynch syndrome-associated rectal cancer can show excellent response to NCRT,3 patients undergoing watchful delay of surgery require close monitoring and prompt triggering of salvage proctectomy when tumor regrowth is observed.4<sup>,</sup>5.",Case Reports,249.0,1.0,"Robotic surgery is increasingly performed for low cancer.1 A redundant sigmoid makes retraction and pelvic dissection challenging We present a 'pelvis-first approach to robotic proctectomy where pelvic dissection occurs prior to colonic mobilization A 26-year-old woman was diagnosed with a clinical T3N1 adenocarcinoma at 3 cm from the verge The patient had Lynch syndrome with a germline mutation in the PMS2 gene A near-complete clinical response was observed after neoadjuvant chemoradiation NCRT and the patient wished to delay surgery and permanent colostomy Additional FOLFOX was administered and led to a complete clinical response After 2.5 months of watchful delay of surgery the tumor regrew and the patient then underwent robotic abdominoperineal resection APR Initial exploration revealed a highly redundant sigmoid A pelvis-first approach was undertaken The was left tethered and outside of the pelvis during the pelvic dissection The levator ani was divided transabdominally Vascular dissection and left mobilization were completed after pelvic dissection.2 The specimen was removed transanally obviating the need for abdominal incision An end colostomy was created laparoscopically and the perineum was closed primarily after omental flap The patient recovered without complications The 'pelvis-first approach to proctectomy is advantageous for patients with a highly redundant sigmoid Transabdominal division of the levator ani during APR ensures excellent circumferential margin Although Lynch syndrome-associated cancer can show excellent response to NCRT,3 patients undergoing watchful delay of surgery require close monitoring and prompt triggering of salvage proctectomy when tumor regrowth is observed.4 sup /sup 5",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[2895, 152, 16, 1635, 173, 9, 154, 12, 14, 8, 10716, 9356, 4677, 16286, 2, 1110, 1161, 1950, 21, 364, 8, 51531, 157, 353, 6, 2895, 12899, 1257, 1110, 1161, 1780, 324, 6, 3663, 4030, 8, 432, 111, 1095, 2854, 10, 265, 5, 8, 38, 17641, 449, 28, 27, 494, 29, 3, 8330, 3, 69, 42, 3546, 681, 5, 8, 1009, 258, 4, 3, 7300, 145, 8, 1829, 236, 38, 51, 10, 164, 50, 536, 975, 8353, 2, 3, 69, 11382, 6, 1984, 152, 2, 4377, 7635, 402, 3777, 10, 468, 2, 836, 6, 8, 236, 38, 51, 50, 18, 33, 53, 1, 10689, 1984, 1, 152, 3, 30, 33566, 2, 3, 69, 818, 208, 2895, 8177, 170, 7012, 388, 3370, 553, 8, 561, 10716, 9356, 8, 3270, 157, 353, 10, 2789, 3, 10, 1712, 19636, 2, 2513, 1, 3, 3270, 190, 3, 1110, 1161, 3, 28927, 34566, 10, 2176, 74799, 756, 1161, 2, 1712, 4030, 11, 781, 50, 1110, 1161, 18, 3, 2360, 10, 2264, 44183, 21174, 3, 594, 9, 1467, 7538, 35, 396, 7635, 10, 2466, 11472, 2, 3, 33547, 10, 3745, 1561, 50, 11404, 3942, 3, 69, 5784, 187, 521, 3, 51531, 157, 353, 6, 12899, 16, 10650, 9, 7, 5, 8, 561, 10716, 9356, 16333, 5750, 1, 3, 28927, 34566, 190, 7012, 18467, 1503, 7937, 959, 242, 3546, 681, 41, 12, 122, 514, 1503, 51, 6, 8353, 27, 7, 479, 10689, 1984, 1, 152, 1353, 2336, 1315, 2, 4776, 8867, 1, 992, 12899, 198, 30, 8673, 16, 164, 39, 172, 172, 33]",1737.0,31102088,0
Pencil Beam Scanning Proton Beam Chemoradiation Therapy With 5-Fluorouracil and Mitomycin-C for Definitive Treatment of Carcinoma of the Anal Canal: A Multi-institutional Pilot Feasibility Study.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2019-05-22,"Definitive chemoradiation with concurrent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/mitomycin C (MMC) is an effective treatment for localized anal cancer, but it is associated with significant acute long-term treatment-related toxicity. Pencil beam scanning proton beam (PBS-PT) radiation therapy may potentially reduce this toxicity. This is a multi-institutional pilot study evaluating the feasibility of definitive concurrent chemoradiation with PBS-PT in combination with 5-FU and MMC for carcinoma of the anal canal. Patients were enrolled on a National Cancer Institute-sponsored, prospective, multi-institutional, single-arm pilot study (NCT01858025). Key eligibility criteria included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0 to 2, age ≥18 years, histologically confirmed invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal, and clinically staged T1-4, N0-3 disease. Patients were treated with PBS-PT per Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0529 dose schema and concurrent 5-FU/MMC on day 1 and 29. The primary objective of this study was to determine feasibility of PBS-PT with concurrent 5-FU/MMC, defined as grade 3+ dermatologic toxicity less than 48% (reported grade 3+ dermatologic toxicity from Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 98-11). Secondary objectives were to determine the rates of overall grade 3+ toxicities, clinical complete response rate, and disease outcomes. Between February 2014 and April 2017, we enrolled 25 patients into our study, all of whom were analyzed. Twenty-three patients (92%) completed treatment per protocol, and 2 patients died on treatment. Median time to completion of treatment was 42 days (range, 38-49). The grade 3+ radiation dermatitis rate was 24%. Median follow-up is 27 months (range, 21-50) among the 21 patients still alive. The overall rate of clinical complete response was 88%. The 2-year local failure, colostomy-free survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival are 12%, 72%, 80%, and 84%, respectively. In our prospective, multi-institutional pilot study of PBS-PT with concurrent 5-FU/MMC, PBS-PT was found to be feasible.
