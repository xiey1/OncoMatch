Prognostic factors in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-associated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.,Recent results in cancer research. Fortschritte der Krebsforschung. Progres dans les recherches sur le cancer,Recent Results Cancer Res.,2002-01-01,"Chemotherapy regimens similar to those used for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) not associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have been used for patients with HIV-associated NHL with less success. In a recent trial, patients with intermediate or high-grade NHL were randomized to either low-dose chemotherapy with methotrexate, bleomycin, doxorubicin, vincristine and dexamethasone (m-BACOD) or to standard-dose m-BACOD with sargramostim (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, GM-CSF). With low-dose m-BACOD 41% of patients achieved a complete remission and the median survival was 35 weeks. With standard-dose m-BACOD and sargramostim, the percentage of complete remissions was 52% with a median survival of 31 weeks (P=n.s.). Myelosuppression was greater with standard-dose chemotherapy. In univariate and multivariate analyses of 21 pretreatment features of patients in this trial, four factors emerged as adversely prognostic with respect to survival: age >35 years, intravenous drug use, CD4 counts < 100/mm3 and stage III/IV disease. In an analysis using the proportional hazards model, a ""favorable"" group was defined by patients with 0 or 1 adverse factor (median survival 46 weeks, survival at 144 weeks 29.5%) as compared with an unfavorable group with 3 or 4 adverse factors (median survival 18 weeks, survival at 144 weeks 0). The outcome of these patients may be improving with the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which seems to improve immune function and tolerance of chemotherapy. A recent trial of the AIDS Malignancy Consortium found that low-dose chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone: CHOP) and standard-dose chemotherapy had similar response rates, acceptable toxicity and minimal alterations in cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and indinavir pharmacokinetics in HIV-associated lymphoma patients also on HAART (stavudine, lamivudine and indinavir). There is a suggestion that Burkitt-type lymphomas may tend to occur in HIV-infected patients with relatively well preserved immune function and CD4 cell counts. Recent results from our institution suggest that similar outcomes are achievable with intensive chemotherapy in patients with Burkitt's lymphomas with or without HIV infection. With improved immune status and improved bone marrow function with the use of HAART, it will probably become more possible to treat many patients with aggressive HIV-associated NHL with more intensive treatment regimens.",Clinical Trial,6594.0,6.0,Chemotherapy regimens similar to those used for 's NHL not associated with human immunodeficiency virus HIV infection have been used for patients with HIV-associated NHL with less success In a recent trial patients with intermediate or high-grade NHL were randomized to either low-dose chemotherapy with methotrexate bleomycin doxorubicin vincristine and dexamethasone m-BACOD or to standard-dose m-BACOD with sargramostim granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor GM-CSF With low-dose m-BACOD 41 of patients achieved a complete remission and the median survival was 35 weeks With standard-dose m-BACOD and sargramostim the percentage of complete remissions was 52 with a median survival of 31 weeks P=n.s Myelosuppression was greater with standard-dose chemotherapy In univariate and multivariate analyses of 21 pretreatment features of patients in this trial four factors emerged as adversely prognostic with respect to survival age 35 years intravenous drug use CD4 counts 100/mm3 and stage III/IV disease In an analysis using the proportional hazards model a `` favorable '' group was defined by patients with 0 or 1 adverse factor median survival 46 weeks survival at 144 weeks 29.5 as compared with an unfavorable group with 3 or 4 adverse factors median survival 18 weeks survival at 144 weeks 0 The outcome of these patients may be improving with the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy HAART which seems to improve immune function and tolerance of chemotherapy A recent trial of the AIDS Malignancy Consortium found that low-dose chemotherapy cyclophosphamide doxorubicin vincristine and prednisone CHOP and standard-dose chemotherapy had similar response rates acceptable toxicity and minimal alterations in cyclophosphamide doxorubicin and indinavir pharmacokinetics in HIV-associated patients also on HAART stavudine lamivudine and indinavir There is a suggestion that Burkitt-type lymphomas may tend to occur in HIV-infected patients with relatively well preserved immune function and CD4 cell counts Recent results from our institution suggest that similar outcomes are achievable with intensive chemotherapy in patients with 's lymphomas with or without HIV infection With improved immune status and improved marrow function with the use of HAART it will probably become more possible to treat many patients with aggressive HIV-associated NHL with more intensive treatment regimens,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[56, 472, 288, 6, 135, 95, 9, 292, 1176, 44, 41, 5, 171, 5323, 1450, 1942, 930, 47, 85, 95, 9, 7, 5, 1942, 41, 1176, 5, 299, 1825, 4, 8, 435, 160, 7, 5, 919, 15, 64, 88, 1176, 11, 384, 6, 361, 154, 61, 56, 5, 2116, 5213, 856, 2132, 2, 1217, 188, 30186, 15, 6, 260, 61, 188, 30186, 5, 15821, 2764, 2674, 1975, 2122, 161, 2147, 1211, 5, 154, 61, 188, 30186, 605, 1, 7, 513, 8, 236, 734, 2, 3, 52, 25, 10, 465, 244, 5, 260, 61, 188, 30186, 2, 15821, 3, 1150, 1, 236, 3166, 10, 653, 5, 8, 52, 25, 1, 456, 244, 19, 78, 695, 2858, 10, 378, 5, 260, 61, 56, 4, 880, 2, 331, 318, 1, 239, 1194, 404, 1, 7, 4, 26, 160, 294, 130, 2054, 22, 4311, 177, 5, 2184, 6, 25, 89, 465, 60, 1262, 234, 119, 1440, 1911, 394, 8434, 2, 82, 316, 478, 34, 4, 35, 65, 75, 3, 831, 1017, 202, 8, 913, 522, 87, 10, 395, 20, 7, 5, 13, 15, 14, 290, 161, 52, 25, 641, 244, 25, 28, 4415, 244, 462, 33, 22, 72, 5, 35, 2483, 87, 5, 27, 15, 39, 290, 130, 52, 25, 203, 244, 25, 28, 4415, 244, 13, 3, 228, 1, 46, 7, 68, 40, 1673, 5, 3, 119, 1, 561, 544, 6564, 36, 6776, 92, 2744, 6, 401, 250, 343, 2, 2614, 1, 56, 8, 435, 160, 1, 3, 4174, 710, 2404, 204, 17, 154, 61, 56, 1112, 856, 2132, 2, 1979, 2907, 2, 260, 61, 56, 42, 288, 51, 151, 1595, 155, 2, 1048, 593, 4, 1112, 856, 2, 42819, 1159, 4, 1942, 41, 7, 120, 23, 6776, 42820, 25965, 2, 42819, 125, 16, 8, 8634, 17, 14387, 267, 1557, 68, 5406, 6, 1271, 4, 1942, 3369, 7, 5, 1352, 149, 5797, 250, 343, 2, 1440, 31, 1911, 435, 99, 29, 114, 731, 309, 17, 288, 123, 32, 6171, 5, 1686, 56, 4, 7, 5, 292, 1557, 5, 15, 187, 1942, 930, 5, 231, 250, 156, 2, 231, 581, 343, 5, 3, 119, 1, 6776, 192, 303, 4061, 1417, 80, 899, 6, 943, 445, 7, 5, 571, 1942, 41, 1176, 5, 80, 1686, 24, 472]",2411.0,11785838,70
Cloning of an Alpha-TFEB fusion in renal tumors harboring the t(6;11)(p21;q13) chromosome translocation.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2003-04-28,"MITF, TFE3, TFEB, and TFEC comprise a transcription factor family (MiT) that regulates key developmental pathways in several cell lineages. Like MYC, MiT members are basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper transcription factors. MiT members share virtually perfect homology in their DNA binding domains and bind a common DNA motif. Translocations of TFE3 occur in specific subsets of human renal cell carcinomas and in alveolar soft part sarcomas. Although multiple translocation partners are fused to TFE3, each translocation product retains TFE3's basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper. We have identified the genes fused by the chromosomal translocation t(6;11)(p21.1;q13), characteristic of another subset of renal neoplasms. In two primary tumors we found that Alpha, an intronless gene, rearranges with the first intron of TFEB, just upstream of TFEB's initiation ATG, preserving the entire TFEB coding sequence. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the involvement of both TFEB and Alpha in this translocation. Although the Alpha promoter drives expression of this fusion gene, the Alpha gene does not contribute to the ORF. Whereas TFE3 is typically fused to partner proteins in subsets of renal tumors, we found that wild-type, unfused TFE3 stimulates clonogenic growth in a cell-based assay, suggesting that dysregulated expression, rather than altered function of TFEB or TFE3 fusions, may confer neoplastic properties, a mechanism reminiscent of MYC activation by promoter substitution in Burkitt's lymphoma. Alpha-TFEB is thus identified as a fusion gene in a subset of pediatric renal neoplasms.",Journal Article,6112.0,193.0,MITF TFE3 TFEB and TFEC comprise a transcription factor family MiT that regulates key developmental pathways in several cell lineages Like MYC MiT members are basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper transcription factors MiT members share virtually perfect homology in their DNA binding domains and bind a common DNA motif Translocations of TFE3 occur in specific subsets of human cell carcinomas and in alveolar soft part sarcomas Although multiple translocation partners are fused to TFE3 each translocation product retains TFE3 's basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper We have identified the genes fused by the chromosomal translocation t 6 11 p21.1 q13 characteristic of another subset of neoplasms In two primary tumors we found that Alpha an intronless gene rearranges with the first intron of TFEB just upstream of TFEB 's initiation ATG preserving the entire TFEB coding sequence Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the involvement of both TFEB and Alpha in this translocation Although the Alpha promoter drives expression of this fusion gene the Alpha gene does not contribute to the ORF Whereas TFE3 is typically fused to partner proteins in subsets of tumors we found that wild-type unfused TFE3 stimulates clonogenic growth in a cell-based assay suggesting that dysregulated expression rather than altered function of TFEB or TFE3 fusions may confer neoplastic properties a mechanism reminiscent of MYC activation by promoter substitution in 's Alpha-TFEB is thus identified as a fusion gene in a subset of pediatric neoplasms,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4882, 4233, 8953, 2, 33426, 5238, 8, 866, 161, 607, 11455, 17, 2468, 825, 4566, 460, 4, 392, 31, 7234, 733, 1371, 11455, 1684, 32, 2795, 8861, 4432, 8861, 10316, 19564, 866, 130, 11455, 1684, 4349, 5860, 8954, 7984, 4, 136, 261, 791, 2703, 2, 4060, 8, 186, 261, 5298, 3262, 1, 4233, 1271, 4, 112, 1890, 1, 171, 31, 826, 2, 4, 5641, 1214, 760, 1479, 242, 232, 2006, 4005, 32, 6263, 6, 4233, 296, 2006, 2821, 10785, 4233, 292, 2795, 8861, 4432, 8861, 10316, 19564, 21, 47, 108, 3, 214, 6263, 20, 3, 1860, 2006, 102, 49, 175, 2657, 14, 9938, 2037, 1, 1809, 697, 1, 1179, 4, 100, 86, 57, 21, 204, 17, 950, 35, 43236, 145, 43237, 5, 3, 157, 6259, 1, 8953, 4673, 3988, 1, 8953, 292, 1118, 7168, 4972, 3, 1797, 8953, 3097, 1532, 1591, 4, 957, 1554, 557, 3, 799, 1, 110, 8953, 2, 950, 4, 26, 2006, 242, 3, 950, 973, 5267, 55, 1, 26, 1212, 145, 3, 950, 145, 1097, 44, 1248, 6, 3, 24471, 547, 4233, 16, 1969, 6263, 6, 4852, 652, 4, 1890, 1, 57, 21, 204, 17, 955, 267, 37443, 4233, 6200, 3798, 129, 4, 8, 31, 90, 719, 802, 17, 4288, 55, 1832, 76, 1495, 343, 1, 8953, 15, 4233, 2530, 68, 2913, 2000, 1571, 8, 670, 17726, 1, 1371, 363, 20, 973, 5029, 4, 292, 950, 8953, 16, 631, 108, 22, 8, 1212, 145, 4, 8, 697, 1, 815, 1179]",1545.0,12719541,9

"Activity of a novel anti-folate (PDX, 10-propargyl 10-deazaaminopterin) against human lymphoma is superior to methotrexate and correlates with tumor RFC-1 gene expression.",Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2003-06-01,"PDX (10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin) is a novel anti-folate with improved membrane transport and polyglutamylation in tumor cells. In prior studies, PDX exhibited enhanced efficacy over methotrexate (MTX) in lung and breast carcinoma xenografts. Because MTX is active in the treatment of aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), we compared the efficacy of PDX and MTX against five lymphoma cell lines: RL (transformed follicular lymphoma), HT, SKI-DLBCL-1 (diffuse large B cell), Raji (Burkitt's), and Hs445 (Hodgkin's disease). After 5-day continuous in vitro exposure, PDX demonstrated > 10-fold greater cytotoxicity than MTX in all cell lines (IC50PDX = 3-5 nM, IC50MTX = 30-50 nM). We then compared the in vivo effects of anti-folates against three established human NHL xenografts in NOD/SCID mice. Tumor bearing animals were treated with saline (control) or the maximum tolerated doses of MTX (40 mg/kg) or PDX (60 mg/kg) via an intraperitoneal route twice weekly for 2 weeks. Almost 90% of HT lymphomas treated with PDX completely regressed, whereas, those treated with MTX treatment had only modest growth delays. In two other xenografts, tumor bearing mice had complete regression rates of 56% (RL) and 30% (SKI-DLBCL-1) after PDX therapy. No regressions and only minor growth inhibition was noted after MTX therapy. RT-PCR analysis for the expression of genes involved in folate metabolism demonstrated that increased sensitivity to PDX correlated with higher RFC-1 gene expression with no difference in FPGS or FPGH levels, suggesting that measurement of tumor RFC-1 gene expression level may be a predictor of response to PDX.

"Intensive chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, high-dose methotrexate/ifosfamide, etoposide, and high-dose cytarabine (CODOX-M/IVAC) for human immunodeficiency virus-associated Burkitt lymphoma.",Cancer,Cancer,2003-09-01,"In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), standard-dose chemotherapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is becoming the standard of care. In contrast, the safety and efficacy of intensive regimens have not been established for Burkitt lymphoma (BL), a highly aggressive lymphoma for which moderate-dose chemotherapy is substandard in the HIV-negative population. To evaluate the feasibility of intensive chemotherapy in HIV-associated BL, the authors retrospectively reviewed 14 HIV-positive adults with BL treated at their center between 1988 and 2000. Eight patients were treated between 1996 and 2000 with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, high-dose methotrexate/ifosfamide, etoposide, and high-dose cytarabine (CODOX-M/IVAC), one of the currently preferred intensive-dose chemotherapy regimens for BL. Six received other chemotherapy. Outcomes were compared with those of 24 HIV-negative adult patients with BL who had similar patient characteristics and were treated concomitantly (13 with CODOX-M/IVAC; 11 with other regimens). Of the 14 HIV-positive patients, 63% had a complete response after CODOX-M/IVAC treatment, compared with 67% of patients receiving other chemotherapy. The 2-year event-free survival (EFS) rates were 60% and 60% after CODOX-M/IVAC or other regimens, respectively. Similar outcomes were seen despite the fact that 88% of CODOX-M/IVAC-treated HIV-positive patients had Stage IV disease, compared with one-third of HIV-positive patients treated with other chemotherapy. HIV status did not adversely affect long-term EFS independent of the treatment regimen (P = 0.88). When EFS was evaluated according to chemotherapy regimen independent of HIV status, CODOX-M/IVAC was found to be associated with improved EFS (P = 0.05) in all patients, and particularly those at high risk. HIV-positive patients treated with CODOX-M/IVAC tolerated chemotherapy well with similar rates of myelosuppression and infectious complications as HIV-negative patients. The current nonrandomized retrospective study suggested that intensive chemotherapy with CODOX-M/IVAC is feasible and well tolerated in HIV-positive adults with BL. In the post-HAART era, intensive chemotherapy such as CODOX-M/IVAC may be appropriate in all adult patients with BL, and especially those with poor prognostic factors, regardless of HIV status.",Comparative Study,5986.0,115.0,In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy HAART standard-dose chemotherapy for human immunodeficiency virus HIV -associated diffuse large B-cell is becoming the standard of care In contrast the safety and efficacy of intensive regimens have not been established for BL a highly aggressive for which moderate-dose chemotherapy is substandard in the HIV-negative population To evaluate the feasibility of intensive chemotherapy in HIV-associated BL the authors retrospectively reviewed 14 HIV-positive adults with BL treated at their center between 1988 and 2000 Eight patients were treated between 1996 and 2000 with cyclophosphamide doxorubicin high-dose methotrexate/ifosfamide etoposide and high-dose cytarabine CODOX-M/IVAC one of the currently preferred intensive-dose chemotherapy regimens for BL Six received other chemotherapy Outcomes were compared with those of 24 HIV-negative adult patients with BL who had similar patient characteristics and were treated concomitantly 13 with CODOX-M/IVAC 11 with other regimens Of the 14 HIV-positive patients 63 had a complete response after CODOX-M/IVAC treatment compared with 67 of patients receiving other chemotherapy The 2-year event-free survival EFS rates were 60 and 60 after CODOX-M/IVAC or other regimens respectively Similar outcomes were seen despite the fact that 88 of CODOX-M/IVAC-treated HIV-positive patients had Stage IV disease compared with one-third of HIV-positive patients treated with other chemotherapy HIV status did not adversely affect long-term EFS independent of the treatment regimen P 0.88 When EFS was evaluated according to chemotherapy regimen independent of HIV status CODOX-M/IVAC was found to be associated with improved EFS P 0.05 in all patients and particularly those at high risk HIV-positive patients treated with CODOX-M/IVAC tolerated chemotherapy well with similar rates of myelosuppression and infectious complications as HIV-negative patients The current nonrandomized retrospective study suggested that intensive chemotherapy with CODOX-M/IVAC is feasible and well tolerated in HIV-positive adults with BL In the post-HAART era intensive chemotherapy such as CODOX-M/IVAC may be appropriate in all adult patients with BL and especially those with poor prognostic factors regardless of HIV status,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4, 3, 1713, 1, 561, 544, 6564, 36, 6776, 260, 61, 56, 9, 171, 5323, 1450, 1942, 41, 1388, 375, 132, 31, 16, 4009, 3, 260, 1, 165, 4, 748, 3, 367, 2, 209, 1, 1686, 472, 47, 44, 85, 635, 9, 6331, 8, 561, 571, 9, 92, 1163, 61, 56, 16, 26213, 4, 3, 1942, 199, 266, 6, 376, 3, 1437, 1, 1686, 56, 4, 1942, 41, 6331, 3, 738, 894, 446, 213, 1942, 109, 857, 5, 6331, 73, 28, 136, 574, 59, 3314, 2, 1081, 659, 7, 11, 73, 59, 2648, 2, 1081, 5, 1112, 856, 64, 61, 2116, 3157, 1934, 2, 64, 61, 1855, 20323, 188, 20324, 104, 1, 3, 694, 2514, 1686, 61, 56, 472, 9, 6331, 437, 103, 127, 56, 123, 11, 72, 5, 135, 1, 259, 1942, 199, 780, 7, 5, 6331, 54, 42, 288, 69, 374, 2, 11, 73, 6485, 233, 5, 20323, 188, 20324, 175, 5, 127, 472, 1, 3, 213, 1942, 109, 7, 676, 42, 8, 236, 51, 50, 20323, 188, 20324, 24, 72, 5, 598, 1, 7, 357, 127, 56, 3, 18, 111, 774, 115, 25, 1683, 151, 11, 335, 2, 335, 50, 20323, 188, 20324, 15, 127, 472, 106, 288, 123, 11, 527, 550, 3, 1991, 17, 889, 1, 20323, 188, 20324, 73, 1942, 109, 7, 42, 82, 478, 34, 72, 5, 104, 1282, 1, 1942, 109, 7, 73, 5, 127, 56, 1942, 156, 205, 44, 4311, 1158, 319, 337, 1683, 306, 1, 3, 24, 477, 19, 13, 889, 198, 1683, 10, 194, 768, 6, 56, 477, 306, 1, 1942, 156, 20323, 188, 20324, 10, 204, 6, 40, 41, 5, 231, 1683, 19, 13, 474, 4, 62, 7, 2, 823, 135, 28, 64, 43, 1942, 109, 7, 73, 5, 20323, 188, 20324, 421, 56, 149, 5, 288, 151, 1, 2858, 2, 3398, 521, 22, 1942, 199, 7, 3, 291, 5666, 459, 45, 1148, 17, 1686, 56, 5, 20323, 188, 20324, 16, 1313, 2, 149, 421, 4, 1942, 109, 857, 5, 6331, 4, 3, 539, 6776, 1713, 1686, 56, 225, 22, 20323, 188, 20324, 68, 40, 870, 4, 62, 780, 7, 5, 6331, 2, 1093, 135, 5, 334, 177, 130, 1583, 1, 1942, 156]",2302.0,12973843,68

Chromosome abnormalities may correlate with prognosis in Burkitt/Burkitt-like lymphomas of children and adolescents: a report from Children's Cancer Group Study CCG-E08.,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol.,2004-03-01,"Among pediatric non-Hodgkin lymphomas, the most frequent type is small noncleaved-cell lymphoma (including Burkitt and Burkitt-like). Specific chromosome abnormalities are associated with prognosis in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); however, chromosome abnormalities have not been evaluated for prognostic value in pediatric Burkitt and Burkitt-like lymphomas. For Children's Cancer Group protocol CCG-E-08 Etiologic Study of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in Childhood, 19 patients were enrolled with cytogenetic analysis of Burkitt or Burkitt-like lymphoma and simultaneously enrolled on treatment protocols CCG-503 or CCG-552. Pathology material and karyotypes at initial diagnosis underwent central review. Demographics included an age range of 2 to 14 years (median 8 years) and a male:female ratio of 14:5. All patients had advanced disease (stages III and IV, or ALL). Disease relapsed in five patients (event-free survival 74%, median follow-up 10.4 years). Chromosome abnormalities were identified in 18 patients (95%) including t(8;14)(q24.1;q32) in 12 (63%); t(8;22)(q24.1;q11.2) in 1 (5%); partial duplication of 1q in 7 (37%); and 13q32 abnormalities in 2 (11%). In patients who had relapses, in addition to the t(8;14)(q24. ;q32), two had abnormalities of 13q32 and two had partial duplication of 1q. CMYC translocations were absent in Burkitt-like lymphomas from all three patients. Burkitt and Burkitt-like lymphomas in children have a high frequency of chromosome abnormalities.

Selective efficacy of depsipeptide in a xenograft model of Epstein-Barr virus-positive lymphoproliferative disorder.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2004-10-01,"Immune-compromised individuals are at increased risk for developing aggressive Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disorders after primary EBV infection or for reactivation of a preexisting latent EBV infection. We evaluated the effect of depsipeptide, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, on EBV-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and Burkitt lymphoma cell lines in a mouse model and explored its mechanism of action in vitro. We studied EBV-transformed LCLs, which express a latent III (Lat-III) viral gene profile, as do some EBV-positive lymphoproliferative malignancies, and Burkitt lymphoma cell lines, which express a Lat-I viral gene profile. Cell lines were used to characterize depsipeptide-induced apoptosis, which was evaluated by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry, western blot analyses, and histone deacetylase inhibitors were used to investigate components of prodeath and survival pathways in vitro. We studied depsipeptide's effects on survival with a mouse xenograft model of EBV-positive human B-cell tumors (groups of 10 mice). All statistical tests were two-sided. Depsipeptide (5 mg/m2 of body surface area) treatment was associated with statistically significantly improved survival of mice carrying Lat-III EBV-positive LCL tumors, compared with that of control-treated mice (day 30: for depsipeptide-treated mice, 90% survival, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 73.2% to 100%; for control-treated mice, 20% survival, 95% CI = 5.79% to 69.1%; P<.001), but it was not associated with survival of mice carrying Lat-I EBV-positive Burkitt lymphoma tumors. Depsipeptide induced apoptosis in 64% of LCLs and in 14% of EBV-positive Burkitt lymphoma cells in vitro. Depsipeptide-treated LCL cultures had two distinct cell populations--one sensitive and one resistant to depsipeptide. Depsipeptide-mediated apoptosis was associated with a 12-fold increased level of active caspase 3, but some apoptosis persisted despite z-VAD-fmk treatment to inhibit caspase activity. Depsipeptide-resistant LCLs expressed higher levels of latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1; P = .017), BCL2 (P = .032), and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) (P<.001) than depsipeptide-sensitive LCLs; this resistance was circumvented by treatment with PS-1145, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation (P<.001). Apoptosis is induced by depsipeptide via caspase-dependent and -independent pathways in Lat-III EBV-positive LCLs and is enhanced by inhibiting NF-kappaB activity. Depsipeptide as a treatment for Lat-III EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders should be explored further in clinical trials.",Journal Article,5590.0,29.0,Immune-compromised individuals are at increased risk for developing aggressive Epstein-Barr virus EBV -associated lymphoproliferative disorders after primary EBV infection or for reactivation of a preexisting latent EBV infection We evaluated the effect of depsipeptide a histone deacetylase inhibitor on EBV-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines LCLs and cell lines in a mouse model and explored its mechanism of action in vitro We studied EBV-transformed LCLs which express a latent III Lat-III viral gene profile as do some EBV-positive lymphoproliferative malignancies and cell lines which express a Lat-I viral gene profile Cell lines were used to characterize depsipeptide-induced apoptosis which was evaluated by flow cytometry Flow cytometry western blot analyses and histone deacetylase inhibitors were used to investigate components of prodeath and survival pathways in vitro We studied depsipeptide 's effects on survival with a mouse xenograft model of EBV-positive human B-cell tumors groups of 10 mice All statistical tests were two-sided Depsipeptide 5 mg/m2 of body surface area treatment was associated with statistically significantly improved survival of mice carrying Lat-III EBV-positive LCL tumors compared with that of control-treated mice day 30 for depsipeptide-treated mice 90 survival 95 confidence interval CI 73.2 to 100 for control-treated mice 20 survival 95 CI 5.79 to 69.1 P .001 but it was not associated with survival of mice carrying Lat-I EBV-positive tumors Depsipeptide induced apoptosis in 64 of LCLs and in 14 of EBV-positive cells in vitro Depsipeptide-treated LCL cultures had two distinct cell populations -- one sensitive and one resistant to depsipeptide Depsipeptide-mediated apoptosis was associated with a 12-fold increased level of active caspase 3 but some apoptosis persisted despite z-VAD-fmk treatment to inhibit caspase activity Depsipeptide-resistant LCLs expressed higher levels of latent membrane protein 1 LMP1 P .017 BCL2 P .032 and nuclear factor kappaB NF-kappaB P .001 than depsipeptide-sensitive LCLs this resistance was circumvented by treatment with PS-1145 an inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation P .001 Apoptosis is induced by depsipeptide via caspase-dependent and -independent pathways in Lat-III EBV-positive LCLs and is enhanced by inhibiting NF-kappaB activity Depsipeptide as a treatment for Lat-III EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders should be explored further in clinical trials,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[250, 4867, 869, 32, 28, 101, 43, 9, 931, 571, 5212, 5190, 1450, 2672, 41, 4192, 1997, 50, 86, 2672, 930, 15, 9, 3834, 1, 8, 5004, 6011, 2672, 930, 21, 194, 3, 254, 1, 10072, 8, 1508, 2732, 230, 23, 2672, 109, 10994, 31, 285, 12795, 2, 31, 285, 4, 8, 830, 202, 2, 1443, 211, 670, 1, 1578, 4, 439, 21, 656, 2672, 2423, 12795, 92, 1669, 8, 6011, 316, 13108, 316, 1667, 145, 800, 22, 1022, 476, 2672, 109, 4192, 441, 2, 31, 285, 92, 1669, 8, 13108, 70, 1667, 145, 800, 31, 285, 11, 95, 6, 1507, 10072, 277, 351, 92, 10, 194, 20, 1412, 1914, 1412, 1914, 1521, 2639, 318, 2, 1508, 2732, 222, 11, 95, 6, 963, 1628, 1, 37778, 2, 25, 460, 4, 439, 21, 656, 10072, 292, 176, 23, 25, 5, 8, 830, 1330, 202, 1, 2672, 109, 171, 132, 31, 57, 271, 1, 79, 399, 62, 1050, 895, 11, 100, 1689, 10072, 33, 81, 821, 1, 642, 1255, 965, 24, 10, 41, 5, 712, 97, 231, 25, 1, 399, 2934, 13108, 316, 2672, 109, 16216, 57, 72, 5, 17, 1, 182, 73, 399, 218, 201, 9, 10072, 73, 399, 424, 25, 48, 307, 268, 58, 803, 18, 6, 394, 9, 182, 73, 399, 179, 25, 48, 58, 33, 842, 6, 790, 14, 19, 144, 84, 192, 10, 44, 41, 5, 25, 1, 399, 2934, 13108, 70, 2672, 109, 57, 10072, 277, 351, 4, 660, 1, 12795, 2, 4, 213, 1, 2672, 109, 37, 4, 439, 10072, 73, 16216, 3231, 42, 100, 834, 31, 1184, 104, 745, 2, 104, 436, 6, 10072, 10072, 517, 351, 10, 41, 5, 8, 133, 1116, 101, 301, 1, 544, 1469, 27, 84, 476, 351, 3760, 550, 3905, 10167, 10281, 24, 6, 1433, 1469, 128, 10072, 436, 12795, 570, 142, 148, 1, 6011, 1905, 178, 14, 13574, 19, 3825, 3214, 19, 4708, 2, 928, 161, 2119, 1365, 2119, 19, 144, 76, 10072, 745, 12795, 26, 251, 10, 30660, 20, 24, 5, 1511, 23131, 35, 230, 1, 1365, 2119, 363, 19, 144, 351, 16, 277, 20, 10072, 847, 1469, 470, 2, 306, 460, 4, 13108, 316, 2672, 109, 12795, 2, 16, 651, 20, 2062, 1365, 2119, 128, 10072, 22, 8, 24, 9, 13108, 316, 2672, 41, 4192, 1997, 257, 40, 1443, 195, 4, 38, 143]",2458.0,15467034,2
Enhanced antilymphoma efficacy of CD19-redirected influenza MP1-specific CTLs by cotransfer of T cells modified to present influenza MP1.,Blood,Blood,2004-10-26,"To enhance the in vivo antitumor activity of adoptively transferred, CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-redirected cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), we studied the effect of restimulating CAR(+) CTLs through their endogenous virus-specific T-cell antigen receptor (TcR) by the cotransfer of engineered T-cell antigen-presenting cells (T-APCs). Using influenza A matrix protein 1 (MP1) as a model antigen, we show that ex vivo-expanded CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-APCs expressing a hygromycin phosphotransferase-MP1 fusion protein (HyMP1) process and present MP1 to autologous human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted, MP1-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) CTL precursors. The MP1-specific CTLs are amenable to subsequent genetic modification to express a CD19-specific CAR, designated CD19R, and acquire HLA-unrestricted reactivity toward CD19(+) leukemia and lymphoma tumor targets while maintaining HLA-restricted MP1 specificity. The restimulation of MP1xCD19 dual-specific CTLs in vivo by the adoptive transfer of irradiated HyMP1(+) T-APCs resulted in the enhanced antilymphoma potency of bispecific effector cells, as measured by elimination of the biophotonic signal of established firefly luciferase-expressing Burkitt lymphoma xenografts in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/scid) animals compared with control groups restimulated by Hy(+)MP1(neg) T-APCs.

Hyperuricemic syndromes in cancer patients.,Contributions to nephrology,Contrib Nephrol,2005-01-01,"Tumor lysis syndrome is a challenging complication of cancer therapy. This review focuses on the risk factors and pathologies of patients at risk for hyperuricemic complications. A review of the literature was performed that included original articles and related reviews from MEDLINE (PubMed) and published abstracts of meeting presentations. Both host-related and tumor-related factors predispose cancer patients to hyperuricemic syndromes. Host-related factors include low urinary flow, pre-existing hyperuricemia, renal failure, dehydration, acidic urine, and suppressed renal uric acid excretion. Tumor-related risk factors include a high tumor cell proliferation rate, large tumor burden, and tumor chemosensitivity. Acute renal failure may occur after cytoreductive chemotherapy in patients with active disease and a high tumor burden. Patients with advanced Burkitt's leukemia/lymphoma, high-grade lymphoma, or acute leukemia with elevated leukocyte counts are at high risk for complications of hyperuricemia.

Three hundred sixty-three patients with AIDS-related lymphoma diagnosed from 1982 to 2003 were reviewed retrospectively, including 262 in the pre-HAART (HIV-BL, 117; HIV-DLCL, 145) and 101 in the HAART era (HIV-BL, 18; HIV-DLCL, 83). Pre-HAART included those who did not receive HAART, and HAART era included those diagnosed after January 1997 who received HAART. There were no significant differences between groups in terms of age, sex, history of injection drug use, prior AIDS, lactate dehydrogenase level, and disease stage at diagnosis. Compared with HIV-BL, HIV-DLCL was associated with significantly lower CD4 counts in the pre-HAART but not the HAART era. Although the overall median survival was similar for both groups in the pre-HAART era (HIV-BL, 6.4 months v HIV-DLCL, 8.3 months; P = .43), survival was significantly worse in patients with HIV-BL in the HAART era (HIV-BL, 5.7 months v HIV-DLCL, 43.2 months; P = .0003). Failure to attain complete remission and CD4 count less than 100 cells/mm(3) independently predicted for poor survival in the pre-HAART era. In comparison, histology of HIV-BL and no attainment of complete remission were independent poor prognostic factors in the HAART era.

Secondary chromosomal abnormalities predict outcome in pediatric and adult high-stage Burkitt lymphoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2006-09-01,"Karyotypic abnormalities in sporadic Burkitt lymphoma (BL) have been described extensively. However, to the authors' knowledge, very limited studies have focused on the secondary chromosomal abnormalities in pediatric BL as compared with those of adult BL and on their prognostic impact. A retrospective analysis was performed in all pediatric and adult patients at 2 institutions, with a morphologic diagnosis of BL, pretherapy tumor karyotype available, and t(8;14), t(8;22), or t(2;8) present. There were 33 children and 37 adults. The majority of the patients (95%) had Stage III/IV disease.

Lymphoma,2006-08-01,"Topoisomerase enzymes are critical components of genomic replication and function to minimize torsional stress on DNA. Sequential administration of a topoisomerase II inhibitor followed by a topoisomerase I inhibitor is potentially synergistic due to increased target enzyme levels. Patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) were eligible for this phase II study of doxorubicin 25 mg/m2 intravenous (IV) on day 1 and topotecan 1.75 mg/m2/day IV on days 3 - 5, every 21 days. The trial objectives included the overall response rate, progression-free survival, and toxicity. Twenty-six patients were enrolled and 25 patients are assessable for toxicity and response. The median age was 58 (range 23 - 74) years. The patients had received a median of two (range one to five) prior regimens, including five patients with a prior stem cell transplant. Five patients (20%, 95% confidence interval 0.07, 0.42) responded with two (8%) complete remissions and three (12%) partial remissions; an additional four (16%) patients had stable disease. Both patients achieving a complete remission had Burkitt's lymphoma. There were no treatment-related deaths. In conclusion, the combination of doxorubicin and topotecan is well tolerated and has modest activity in relapsed/refractory NHL, with occasional patients having a prolonged remission.

Heterogeneous CD52 expression among hematologic neoplasms: implications for the use of alemtuzumab (CAMPATH-1H).,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2006-12-01,"CD52 is a GPI-linked glycoprotein expressed by B cells, T cells, monocytes, and macrophages. The humanized monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab (CAMPATH-1H) is specific for CD52 and is Food and Drug Administration - approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The utility of CAMPATH in the treatment of other hematologic neoplasms has been explored; however, a comprehensive survey of CD52 expression among a broad spectrum of WHO-defined tumor types has not been completed. We evaluated 294 hematologic neoplasms for the presence of CD52 using standard immunohistochemical techniques on paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens fixed with formalin, B-Plus, Zenker's acetic acid, or B5-formalin. The vast majority of low-grade B cell lymphoproliferative disorders (CLL/small lymphocytic leukemia, follicular lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas) express CD52. In addition, we found that the majority of precursor B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphomas express this antigen. In contrast, there is surprising heterogeneity in CD52 expression among more aggressive B cell lymphomas, with 25% of cases of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma demonstrating no detectable CD52. In addition, the majority of neoplasms of the T cell lineage are negative for the antigen, including most cases of precursor T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and peripheral T cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified. Finally, the vast majority of cases of acute myeloid leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma are negative for CD52 expression.

Should adolescents with NHL be treated as old children or young adults?,Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,2007-01-01,"The SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) data for the years 1975-1998 show that children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) have a better treatment outcome than do adults. Many factors may contribute to this age-related difference. Some factors are related to the patient (e.g., drug distribution and clearance, performance status, compliance, sex) whereas others pertain to tumor histology and biology. The spectrum of NHL subtypes is well known to differ in children and adults. From ages 5 through 14 years, Burkitt lymphoma is the predominant histologic subtype, whereas diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is most common in the 15- to 29-year age range. Because different treatment strategies are often used in children and adults with NHL, the choice of therapy for adolescents and young adults (ages 15 through 29 years) is challenging and somewhat controversial. It is reasonable to consider pediatric strategies for some adolescents and very young adults with NHL, and pediatric strategies are currently used to treat adults with certain subtypes of NHL (Burkitt lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma). However, the use of pediatric strategies in adults does not guarantee a comparable outcome, as illustrated by trials for adult lymphoblastic lymphoma.

A novel Raji-Burkitt's lymphoma model for preclinical and mechanistic evaluation of CD52-targeted immunotherapeutic agents.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2008-01-01,"To date, efforts to study CD52-targeted therapies, such as alemtuzumab, have been limited due to the lack of stable CD52 expressing transformed B-cell lines and animal models. We describe generation and utilization of cell lines that stably express CD52 both in vitro and in vivo. By limiting dilution, we have established several clones of Raji-Burkitt's lymphoma cell line that express surface CD52. Immunophenotype and cytogenetic characterization of these clones was done. In vivo usefulness of the CD52(high) cell line to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of CD52-directed antibody was investigated using a SCID mouse xenograft model. Stable expression of CD52 was confirmed in cells cultured in vitro up to 52 weeks of continuous growth. The functional integrity of the expressed CD52 molecule was shown using alemtuzumab, which induced cytotoxic effects in vitro in the CD52(high) but not the CD52(low) clone. Compared with control antibody, alemtuzumab treatment in CD52(high) inoculated mice resulted in significantly increased median survival. Comparable levels of CD52-targeted direct cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and anti-CD52 immunoliposome-mediated delivery of synthetic oligodeoxyribo nucleotides in CD52(high) clone and primary B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells implicated potential in vivo application of this model for evaluation of CD52-targeted antibody and immunoliposomes encapsulating therapeutic agents. These results show the in vitro utility of the cloned Raji cell lines that stably express high levels CD52.

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation for patients with relapsed chemorefractory aggressive non-hodgkin lymphomas.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2009-03-09,"Patients with chemorefractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) generally have poor clinical outcomes with available therapies. Allogeneic transplantation may be curative, but few studies are available to guide transplant decision making in this setting. We examined allogeneic transplantation outcomes for 46 patients with chemorefractory, aggressive NHL patients who had either stable disease (SD; n = 32) or progressive disease (PD; n = 14), respectively, following last salvage treatment. The median age was 46 years (range: 22-63 years). Thirty-nine patients received matched sibling allografts, whereas 7 underwent unrelated donor transplantation. Diagnoses included diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 18), Burkitt's lymphoma (n = 3), transformed B cell lymphoma (n = 5), mantle cell lymphoma (n = 11), and peripheral T cell lymphoma (n = 9). The median number of prior therapies was 3 (range: 2-8). Median follow-up of surviving patients is 5 years. Five-year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and relapse rate for the whole cohort (n = 46) were 38%, 34%, and 35%, respectively. The rate of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) was 43%. Of the 33 evaluable patients 75% developed chronic GVHD (cGVHD). Overall nonrelapse mortality (NRM) rate was 34%. The 5-year OS and PFS rates for patients with SD and PD were 46% versus 21% (P = .01; log-rank test), and 46% versus 7% (P = .0002; log-rank test), respectively.

Central nervous system disease in hematologic malignancies: historical perspective and practical applications.,Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2009-08-01,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) 5-year survival rates are approaching 90% in children and 50% in adults who are receiving contemporary risk-directed treatment protocols. Current efforts focus not only on further improving cure rate but also on patient quality of life. Hence, all protocols decrease or limit the use of cranial irradiation as central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy, even in patients with high-risk presenting features, such as the presence of leukemia cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (even resulting from traumatic lumbar puncture), adverse genetic features, T-cell immunophenotype, and a large leukemia cell burden. Current strategies for CNS-directed therapy involve effective systemic chemotherapy (eg, dexamethasone, high-dose methotrexate, intensive asparaginase) and early intensification and optimization of intrathecal therapy. Options under investigation for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CNS leukemia in ALL patients include thiotepa and intrathecal liposomal cytarabine. CNS involvement in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is associated with young age, advanced stage, number of extranodal sites, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and International Prognostic Index score. Refractory CNS lymphoma in patients with NHL carries a poor prognosis, with a median survival of 2 to 6 months; the most promising treatment, autologous stem cell transplant, can extend median survival from 10 to 26 months. CNS prophylaxis is required during the initial treatment of NHL subtypes that carry a high risk of CNS relapse, such as B-cell ALL, Burkitt lymphoma, and lymphoblastic lymphoma. The use of CNS prophylaxis in the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is controversial because of the low risk of CNS relapse ( approximately 5%) in this population.

EBNA1 regulates cellular gene expression by binding cellular promoters.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2009-12-22,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with several types of lymphomas and epithelial tumors including Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), HIV-associated lymphoma, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) is expressed in all EBV associated tumors and is required for latency and transformation. EBNA1 initiates latent viral replication in B cells, maintains the viral genome copy number, and regulates transcription of other EBV-encoded latent genes. These activities are mediated through the ability of EBNA1 to bind viral-DNA. To further elucidate the role of EBNA1 in the host cell, we have examined the effect of EBNA1 on cellular gene expression by microarray analysis using the B cell BJAB and the epithelial 293 cell lines transfected with EBNA1. Analysis of the data revealed distinct profiles of cellular gene changes in BJAB and 293 cell lines. Subsequently, chromatin immune-precipitation revealed a direct binding of EBNA1 to cellular promoters. We have correlated EBNA1 bound promoters with changes in gene expression. Sequence analysis of the 100 promoters most enriched revealed a DNA motif that differs from the EBNA1 binding site in the EBV genome.",Journal Article,3682.0,61.0,Epstein-Barr virus EBV is associated with several types of lymphomas and epithelial tumors including 's BL HIV-associated posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder and carcinoma EBV nuclear antigen 1 EBNA1 is expressed in all EBV associated tumors and is required for latency and transformation EBNA1 initiates latent viral replication in B cells maintains the viral genome copy number and regulates transcription of other EBV-encoded latent genes These activities are mediated through the ability of EBNA1 to bind viral-DNA To further elucidate the role of EBNA1 in the host cell we have examined the effect of EBNA1 on cellular gene expression by microarray analysis using the B cell BJAB and the epithelial 293 cell lines transfected with EBNA1 Analysis of the data revealed distinct profiles of cellular gene changes in BJAB and 293 cell lines Subsequently chromatin immune-precipitation revealed a direct binding of EBNA1 to cellular promoters We have correlated EBNA1 bound promoters with changes in gene expression Sequence analysis of the 100 promoters most enriched revealed a DNA motif that differs from the EBNA1 binding site in the EBV genome,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[5212, 5190, 1450, 2672, 16, 41, 5, 392, 630, 1, 1557, 2, 701, 57, 141, 292, 6331, 1942, 41, 7346, 4192, 2645, 2, 134, 2672, 928, 448, 14, 23807, 16, 570, 4, 62, 2672, 41, 57, 2, 16, 616, 9, 5301, 2, 1392, 23807, 11935, 6011, 1667, 2079, 4, 132, 37, 8107, 3, 1667, 898, 1337, 207, 2, 2468, 866, 1, 127, 2672, 4587, 6011, 214, 46, 2042, 32, 517, 298, 3, 801, 1, 23807, 6, 4060, 1667, 261, 6, 195, 3061, 3, 200, 1, 23807, 4, 3, 1204, 31, 21, 47, 409, 3, 254, 1, 23807, 23, 763, 145, 55, 20, 1727, 65, 75, 3, 132, 31, 22259, 2, 3, 701, 7541, 31, 285, 3245, 5, 23807, 65, 1, 3, 74, 553, 834, 1241, 1, 763, 145, 400, 4, 22259, 2, 7541, 31, 285, 1611, 2287, 250, 18912, 553, 8, 1196, 791, 1, 23807, 6, 763, 4347, 21, 47, 438, 23807, 2951, 4347, 5, 400, 4, 145, 55, 1532, 65, 1, 3, 394, 4347, 96, 2220, 553, 8, 261, 5298, 17, 4990, 29, 3, 23807, 791, 606, 4, 3, 2672, 898]",1156.0,20080792,58
B-cell lymphomas with concurrent IGH-BCL2 and MYC rearrangements are aggressive neoplasms with clinical and pathologic features distinct from Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2010-03-01,"B-cell lymphomas with concurrent IGH-BCL2 and MYC rearrangements, also known as ""double-hit"" lymphomas (DHL), are rare neoplasms characterized by highly aggressive clinical behavior, complex karyotypes, and a spectrum of pathologic features overlapping with Burkitt lymphoma (BL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and B-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (B-LBL). The clinical and pathologic spectrum of this rare entity, including comparison to other high-grade B-cell neoplasms, has not been well defined. We conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical and pathologic features of 20 cases of DHL seen at our institution during a 5-year period. In addition, we carried out case-control comparisons of DHL with BL and International Prognostic Index (IPI)-matched DLBCL. The 11 men and 9 women had a median age of 63.5 years (range 32 to 91). Six patients had a history of grade 1 to 2 follicular lymphoma; review of the prior biopsy specimens in 2 of 5 cases revealed blastoid morphology. Eighteen patients had Ann Arbor stage 3 or 4 disease and all had elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels at presentation. Extranodal disease was present in 17/20 (85%), bone marrow involvement in 10/17 (59%) and central nervous system (CNS) disease in 5/11 (45%). Nineteen patients were treated with combination chemotherapy, of whom 18 received rituximab and 14 received CNS-directed therapy. Fourteen patients (70%) died within 8 months of diagnosis. Median overall survival in the DHL group (4.5 mo) was inferior to both BL (P=0.002) and IPI-matched DLBCL (P=0.04) control patients. Twelve DHL cases (60%) were classified as B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLBCL and BL, 7 cases (35%) as DLBCL, not otherwise specified, and 1 case as B-LBL. Distinguishing features from BL included expression of Bcl2 (P<0.0001), Mum1/IRF4 (P=0.006), Ki-67 <95% (P<0.0001), and absence of EBV-EBER (P=0.006). DHL commonly contained the t(8;22) rather than the t(8;14) seen in most BL controls (P=0.001), and exhibited a higher number of chromosomal aberrations (P=0.0009). DHL is a high-grade B-cell neoplasm with a poor prognosis, resistance to multiagent chemotherapy, and clinical and pathologic features distinct from other high-grade B-cell neoplasms. Familiarity with the morphologic and immunophenotypic spectrum of DHL is important in directing testing to detect concurrent IGH-BCL2 and MYC rearrangements when a karyotype is unavailable. The aggressive clinical behavior and combination of genetic abnormalities seen in these cases may warrant categorization as a separate entity in future classifications and call for novel therapeutic approaches.",Comparative Study,3613.0,267.0,B-cell lymphomas with concurrent IGH-BCL2 and MYC rearrangements also known as `` double-hit '' lymphomas DHL are rare neoplasms characterized by highly aggressive clinical behavior complex karyotypes and a spectrum of pathologic features overlapping with BL diffuse large B-cell DLBCL and B-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia B-LBL The clinical and pathologic spectrum of this rare entity including comparison to other high-grade B-cell neoplasms has not been well defined We conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical and pathologic features of 20 cases of DHL seen at our institution during a 5-year period In addition we carried out case-control comparisons of DHL with BL and International Prognostic Index IPI -matched DLBCL The 11 men and 9 women had a median age of 63.5 years range 32 to 91 Six patients had a history of grade 1 to 2 follicular review of the prior biopsy specimens in 2 of 5 cases revealed blastoid morphology Eighteen patients had Ann Arbor stage 3 or 4 disease and all had elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase LDH levels at presentation Extranodal disease was present in 17/20 85 marrow involvement in 10/17 59 and central nervous system CNS disease in 5/11 45 Nineteen patients were treated with combination chemotherapy of whom 18 received rituximab and 14 received CNS-directed therapy Fourteen patients 70 died within 8 months of diagnosis Median overall survival in the DHL group 4.5 mo was inferior to both BL P=0.002 and IPI-matched DLBCL P=0.04 control patients Twelve DHL cases 60 were classified as B-cell unclassifiable with features intermediate between DLBCL and BL 7 cases 35 as DLBCL not otherwise specified and 1 case as B-LBL Distinguishing features from BL included expression of Bcl2 P 0.0001 Mum1/IRF4 P=0.006 Ki-67 95 P 0.0001 and absence of EBV-EBER P=0.006 DHL commonly contained the t 8 22 rather than the t 8 14 seen in most BL controls P=0.001 and exhibited a higher number of chromosomal aberrations P=0.0009 DHL is a high-grade B-cell neoplasm with a poor prognosis resistance to multiagent chemotherapy and clinical and pathologic features distinct from other high-grade B-cell neoplasms Familiarity with the morphologic and immunophenotypic spectrum of DHL is important in directing testing to detect concurrent IGH-BCL2 and MYC rearrangements when a karyotype is unavailable The aggressive clinical behavior and combination of genetic abnormalities seen in these cases may warrant categorization as a separate entity in future classifications and call for novel therapeutic approaches,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[132, 31, 1557, 5, 750, 5221, 3214, 2, 1371, 2072, 120, 440, 22, 1627, 6519, 522, 1557, 7384, 32, 622, 1179, 765, 20, 561, 571, 38, 1710, 840, 6809, 2, 8, 1873, 1, 510, 404, 4551, 5, 6331, 1388, 375, 132, 31, 1446, 2, 132, 1275, 4763, 2647, 132, 8315, 3, 38, 2, 510, 1873, 1, 26, 622, 2983, 141, 1155, 6, 127, 64, 88, 132, 31, 1179, 71, 44, 85, 149, 395, 21, 426, 8, 459, 65, 1, 38, 2, 510, 404, 1, 179, 140, 1, 7384, 527, 28, 114, 731, 190, 8, 33, 111, 727, 4, 352, 21, 2629, 1205, 473, 182, 2213, 1, 7384, 5, 6331, 2, 944, 177, 558, 3753, 655, 1446, 3, 175, 325, 2, 83, 117, 42, 8, 52, 89, 1, 676, 33, 60, 184, 531, 6, 970, 437, 7, 42, 8, 532, 1, 88, 14, 6, 18, 1974, 206, 1, 3, 324, 411, 623, 4, 18, 1, 33, 140, 553, 16186, 2567, 3195, 7, 42, 7977, 10799, 82, 27, 15, 39, 34, 2, 62, 42, 804, 524, 3330, 2374, 4592, 148, 28, 1031, 4093, 34, 10, 364, 4, 269, 179, 772, 581, 799, 4, 79, 269, 728, 2, 854, 1880, 398, 1025, 34, 4, 33, 175, 512, 3498, 7, 11, 73, 5, 150, 56, 1, 953, 203, 103, 855, 2, 213, 103, 1025, 1166, 36, 3225, 7, 431, 1016, 262, 66, 53, 1, 147, 52, 63, 25, 4, 3, 7384, 87, 39, 33, 2035, 10, 1663, 6, 110, 6331, 19, 13, 1111, 2, 3753, 655, 1446, 19, 13, 755, 182, 7, 2544, 7384, 140, 335, 11, 1373, 22, 132, 31, 14338, 5, 404, 919, 59, 1446, 2, 6331, 67, 140, 465, 22, 1446, 44, 2632, 3575, 2, 14, 473, 22, 132, 8315, 4508, 404, 29, 6331, 159, 55, 1, 3214, 19, 13, 488, 23683, 10018, 19, 13, 1861, 2311, 598, 48, 19, 13, 488, 2, 1127, 1, 2672, 12345, 19, 13, 1861, 7384, 841, 3070, 3, 102, 66, 350, 1832, 76, 3, 102, 66, 213, 527, 4, 96, 6331, 535, 19, 13, 144, 2, 1416, 8, 142, 207, 1, 1860, 2152, 19, 13, 7946, 7384, 16, 8, 64, 88, 132, 31, 2131, 5, 8, 334, 356, 251, 6, 7148, 56, 2, 38, 2, 510, 404, 834, 29, 127, 64, 88, 132, 31, 1179, 10322, 5, 3, 2815, 2, 6599, 1873, 1, 7384, 16, 305, 4, 11321, 471, 6, 1426, 750, 5221, 3214, 2, 1371, 2072, 198, 8, 3385, 16, 9098, 3, 571, 38, 1710, 2, 150, 1, 336, 1171, 527, 4, 46, 140, 68, 2946, 8872, 22, 8, 2282, 2983, 4, 508, 5787, 2, 7715, 9, 229, 189, 611]",2544.0,20118770,24

The novel deacetylase inhibitor AR-42 demonstrates pre-clinical activity in B-cell malignancies in vitro and in vivo.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2010-06-03,"While deacetylase (DAC) inhibitors show promise for the treatment of B-cell malignancies, those introduced to date are weak inhibitors of class I and II DACs or potent inhibitors of class I DAC only, and have shown suboptimal activity or unacceptable toxicities. We therefore investigated the novel DAC inhibitor AR-42 to determine its efficacy in B-cell malignancies. In mantle cell lymphoma (JeKo-1), Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (697) cell lines, the 48-hr IC(50) (50% growth inhibitory concentration) of AR-42 is 0.61 microM or less. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient cells, the 48-hr LC(50) (concentration lethal to 50%) of AR-42 is 0.76 microM. AR-42 produces dose- and time-dependent acetylation both of histones and tubulin, and induces caspase-dependent apoptosis that is not reduced in the presence of stromal cells. AR-42 also sensitizes CLL cells to TNF-Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand (TRAIL), potentially through reduction of c-FLIP.

The impact of MYC expression in lymphoma biology: beyond Burkitt lymphoma.,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",Blood Cells Mol. Dis.,2010-09-06,"Although classically described as the driving oncogene in Burkitt lymphoma (BL), abnormalities of MYC have been recognized in other non-Hodgkin lymphomas as well. For example, MYC is overexpressed in approximately 10% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), conferring an adverse prognosis with chemoresistance and shortened survival; only approximately 30% of patients achieve long-term survival despite modern therapies. In contrast to BL, MYC aberrations in DLBCL are usually associated with multiple cytogenetic abnormalities and other genetic lesions, such as concurrent BCL2 translocations. Patients with so-called ""double-hit"" lymphomas have a worse outcome with few survivors beyond 6 months. It is unclear why MYC translocations are diagnostic in BL but prognostic in other lymphomas; different mechanisms underlying MYC abnormalities and a unique target set of genes may explain some of the variance.

The OSU-DY7-induced cytotoxicity is dependent on caspase activation, as evidenced by induction of caspase-3 activation and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and rescue of cytotoxicity by Z-VAD-FMK. Interestingly, OSU-DY7-induced cytotoxicity is mediated through activation of p38 MAPK, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and downstream target protein MAPKAPK2. Pretreatment of B-CLL cells with SB202190, a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor, results in decreased MAPKAPK2 protein level with concomitant rescue of the cells from OSU-DY7-mediated cytotoxicity.

This study was designed to determine whether epoetin alpha would decrease the number of transfusion events and units of packed erythrocytes (PRBCs) transfused, and the secondary objective was to study the effects of epoetin alpha on quality of life (QOL) and complete remission (CR) rates. Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL), or Burkitt lymphoma (BL) who were receiving frontline myelosuppressive chemotherapy were randomized to receive epoetin alpha or no epoetin during the first 6 cycles of their planned chemotherapy. QOL was assessed by using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Anemia questionnaires. Fifty-five patients were randomized to receive epoetin alpha, and 54 patients received no epoetin. Transfusion data were available for 79 of 81 evaluable patients (98%) who completed the treatment/observation period. The trial was stopped early because of poor accrual before the target of 123 evaluable patients was met. A mean of 10.6 units of PRBCs over 5 months were administered to those who received epoetin alpha compared with 13 units for those who did not receive epoetin (P = .04).

"Prognostic value of MYC rearrangement in cases of B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma.",Cancer,Cancer,2011-08-31,"B-cell lymphoma, Unclassifiable with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma, for convenience referred to here as unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma, is a category in the 2008 World Health Organization system used for a group of histologically aggressive neoplasms that are difficult to classify definitively. Currently, there is no established standard therapy for these neoplasms. The authors assessed MYC status and correlated it with treatment response and outcome in a group of 52 patients with unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma treated with either a standard DLBCL regimen (R-CHOP [rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone-related therapy]) or more intensive regimens, such as R-hyper-CVAD (rituximab plus hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine). The regimens were selected by the treating clinicians based on the overall clinical and pathological findings. Thirty (58%) unclassifiable B-cell lymphomas had MYC abnormalities (MYC(+) ) including 27 with rearrangement, 2 with amplification, and 1 with both. The MYC(+) and MYC(-) groups were similar in their age distribution and International Prognostic Index scores. Progression-free survival of patients with MYC(+) unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma treated initially with R-CHOP was significantly worse than patients treated with R-hyper-CVAD (P = .0358). In contrast, for the MYC(-) unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma group, some patients responded to R-CHOP, and others were refractory to R-hyper-CVAD. MYC aberrations are common in unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma. The presence of MYC aberrations identifies a patient subset that requires more aggressive therapy than R-CHOP. In contrast, MYC(-) unclassifiable B-cell lymphoma patients responded variably to either R-CHOP or aggressive therapy, and the latter showed no survival advantage.",Journal Article,3065.0,48.0,B-cell Unclassifiable with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell DLBCL and for convenience referred to here as unclassifiable B-cell is a category in the 2008 World Health Organization system used for a group of histologically aggressive neoplasms that are difficult to classify definitively Currently there is no established standard therapy for these neoplasms The authors assessed MYC status and correlated it with treatment response and outcome in a group of 52 patients with unclassifiable B-cell treated with either a standard DLBCL regimen R-CHOP rituximab plus cyclophosphamide doxorubicin vincristine and prednisolone-related therapy or more intensive regimens such as R-hyper-CVAD rituximab plus hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide vincristine doxorubicin and dexamethasone alternating with high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine The regimens were selected by the treating clinicians based on the overall clinical and pathological findings Thirty 58 unclassifiable B-cell lymphomas had MYC abnormalities MYC including 27 with rearrangement 2 with amplification and 1 with both The MYC and MYC groups were similar in their age distribution and International Prognostic Index scores Progression-free survival of patients with MYC unclassifiable B-cell treated initially with R-CHOP was significantly worse than patients treated with R-hyper-CVAD P .0358 In contrast for the MYC unclassifiable B-cell group some patients responded to R-CHOP and others were refractory to R-hyper-CVAD MYC aberrations are common in unclassifiable B-cell The presence of MYC aberrations identifies a patient subset that requires more aggressive therapy than R-CHOP In contrast MYC unclassifiable B-cell patients responded variably to either R-CHOP or aggressive therapy and the latter showed no survival advantage,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[132, 31, 14338, 5, 404, 919, 59, 1388, 375, 132, 31, 1446, 2, 9, 8184, 1995, 6, 467, 22, 14338, 132, 31, 16, 8, 2169, 4, 3, 1375, 1956, 341, 2533, 398, 95, 9, 8, 87, 1, 2161, 571, 1179, 17, 32, 1740, 6, 4896, 6008, 694, 125, 16, 77, 635, 260, 36, 9, 46, 1179, 3, 738, 275, 1371, 156, 2, 438, 192, 5, 24, 51, 2, 228, 4, 8, 87, 1, 653, 7, 5, 14338, 132, 31, 73, 5, 361, 8, 260, 1446, 477, 668, 2907, 855, 349, 1112, 856, 2132, 2, 11253, 139, 36, 15, 80, 1686, 472, 225, 22, 668, 4855, 5574, 855, 349, 6201, 1112, 2132, 856, 2, 1217, 5181, 5, 64, 61, 2116, 2, 1855, 3, 472, 11, 715, 20, 3, 1367, 1490, 90, 23, 3, 63, 38, 2, 1301, 272, 977, 717, 14338, 132, 31, 1557, 42, 1371, 1171, 1371, 141, 428, 5, 2675, 18, 5, 1073, 2, 14, 5, 110, 3, 1371, 2, 1371, 271, 11, 288, 4, 136, 89, 1395, 2, 944, 177, 558, 703, 91, 115, 25, 1, 7, 5, 1371, 14338, 132, 31, 73, 1625, 5, 668, 2907, 10, 97, 639, 76, 7, 73, 5, 668, 4855, 5574, 19, 60508, 4, 748, 9, 3, 1371, 14338, 132, 31, 87, 476, 7, 2211, 6, 668, 2907, 2, 1749, 11, 430, 6, 668, 4855, 5574, 1371, 2152, 32, 186, 4, 14338, 132, 31, 3, 463, 1, 1371, 2152, 2953, 8, 69, 697, 17, 1706, 80, 571, 36, 76, 668, 2907, 4, 748, 1371, 14338, 132, 31, 7, 2211, 10184, 6, 361, 668, 2907, 15, 571, 36, 2, 3, 3286, 224, 77, 25, 1874]",1812.0,21882178,24

We report our experience with 60 cases: 52 MYC/BCL2 B-cell lymphomas and 8 tumors with extra MYC signals plus IGH@BCL2 or MYC rearrangement plus extra BCL2 signals/copies. There were 38 men and 22 women with a median age of 55 years. In all, 10 patients had antecedent/concurrent follicular lymphoma. Using the 2008 World Health Organization classification, there were 33 B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma (henceforth referred to as unclassifiable, aggressive B-cell lymphoma), 23 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 1 follicular lymphoma grade 3B, 1 follicular lymphoma plus diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 1 B-lymphoblastic lymphoma, and 1 composite diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with B-lymphoblastic lymphoma. Using older classification systems, the 33 unclassifiable, aggressive B-cell lymphomas most closely resembled Burkitt-like lymphoma (n=24) or atypical Burkitt lymphoma with BCL2 expression (n=9). Of 48 cases assessed, 47 (98%) had a germinal center B-cell immunophenotype. Patients were treated with standard (n=23) or more aggressive chemotherapy regimens (n=34). Adequate follow-up was available for 57 patients: 26 died and 31 were alive. For the 52 patients with MYC/BCL2 lymphoma, the median overall survival was 18.6 months. Patients with antecedent/concurrent follicular lymphoma had median overall survival of 7.8 months. Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level, ≥2 extranodal sites, bone marrow or central nervous system involvement, and International Prognostic Index >2 were associated with worse overall survival (P<0.05).

"Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, is effective in vitro against non-Hodgkin lymphoma and synergizes with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin.",American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2011-12-21,"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) represents a heterogenous group of neoplasias originating from lymphoid cells. Increased angiogenesis and expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and its receptors (VEGFR) have been found to be associated with NHL disease progression. Increase in VEGF and other cytokines stimulate signaling cascades, including the Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk pathway, resulting in increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Here, we report the in vitro antilymphoma activity of sorafenib, an inhibitor of VEGFR and Raf kinase. Sorafenib induced potent cytotoxicity in NHL cell lines and patient samples. This induction of cytotoxicity was associated with a corresponding increase in apoptotic cell death. Mechanism of action of sorafenib was investigated in follicular (DoHH2) and Burkitt lymphoma (Raji) cell lines. pStat3, pAkt, Mcl1, and Xiap were downregulated in both cell lines, whereas pErk decreased in Raji but not in DoHH2 cells following sorafenib treatment. IL6 was unable to prevent sorafenib induced repression of pStat3, pAkt, Mcl1, and Bcl-Xl.

Burkitt lymphoma: staging and response evaluation.,British journal of haematology,Br. J. Haematol.,2012-02-01,"The refinements in both the staging and response evaluation of children with Burkitt lymphoma (BL) have contributed to the improvements in treatment outcome observed over the past 40 years. Ziegler and Magrath designed a staging system in the 1970s for children with BL in equatorial Africa. Currently, the most widely used staging system around the world is that described by Murphy in 1980, which was developed for children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) of any histology. There are opportunities for refinement in this system, particularly with respect to certain extra-nodal sites, such as skin and bone. The findings obtained at diagnosis with novel technologies (functional imaging [e.g., positron emission tomography [PET]] and minimal residual disease [MRD] technology), which are more sensitive with respect to disease detection than historic modalities, also need to be considered. Technological advances have also had impact on the assessment of response evaluation. Standard x-rays were routinely used in the 1960s; nuclear imaging became widely used in the 1970s; computerized axial tomography was incorporated in the 1980s; PET imaging was incorporated and, in many cases, has replaced gallium/bone scans since 2000; and MRD technology has been explored in some of the most recent clinical trials.

A randomized controlled trial of an intensive insulin regimen in patients with hyperglycemic acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2012-06-01,"Hyperglycemia during hyper-CVAD (fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with methotrexate and high-dose cytarabine, with methylprednisolone premedication) chemotherapy is associated with poor outcomes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To examine whether intensive insulin therapy could improve outcomes, a randomized trial was conducted that compared glargine plus aspart vs. conventional therapy. Intensive insulin did not improve ALL clinical outcomes despite improved glycemic control. Secondary analysis suggests that the choice of antidiabetic pharmacotherapy may influence ALL outcomes. Hyperglycemia during hyper-CVAD (fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with methotrexate and high-dose cytarabine, with methylprednisolone premedication) chemotherapy is associated with poor outcomes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To examine whether an intensive insulin regimen could improve outcomes compared with conventional antidiabetic pharmacotherapy, a randomized trial was conducted that compared glargine plus aspart vs. conventional therapy (control). Between April 2004 and July 2008, 52 patients newly diagnosed with ALL, Burkitt lymphoma, or lymphoblastic lymphoma who were on hyper-CVAD in the inpatient setting and had a random serum glucose level >180 mg/dL on ≥2 occasions during chemotherapy were enrolled. The trial was terminated early due to futility regarding ALL clinical outcomes despite improved glycemic control. Secondary analysis revealed that molar insulin-to-C-peptide ratio (I/C) > 0.175 (a surrogate measure of exogenous insulin usage) was associated with decreased overall survival, complete remission duration and progression-free survival (PFS), whereas metformin and/or thiazolidinedione usage were associated with increased PFS. In multivariate analyses, factors that significantly predicted short overall survival included age ≥ 60 years (P = .0002), I/C ≥ 0.175 (P = .0016), and average glucose level ≥ 180 mg/dL (P = .0236). Factors that significantly predicted short PFS included age ≥ 60 years (P = .0008), I/C ≥ 0.175 (P = .0002), high systemic risk (P = .0173) and average glucose level ≥ 180 mg/dL (P = .0249). I/C ≥ 0.175 was the only significant (P = .0042) factor that predicted short complete remission duration.

Clin. Oncol.,2012-09-10,"The Janus kinase 2/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK2/STAT) pathway plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hematologic malignancies. We conducted a phase I dose-finding and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study of SB1518, a potent JAK2 inhibitor, in patients with relapsed lymphoma. Patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma of any type except Burkitt's or CNS lymphoma were enrolled. Patient cohorts received escalating doses of SB1518 orally once daily for 28-day cycles. Response was evaluated after 8 weeks. Thirty-four patients received doses of 100 to 600 mg/d. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Treatment was well tolerated, with mostly grade 1 and 2 toxicities. Gastrointestinal toxicities were the most common treatment-related events. Cytopenias were infrequent and modest. Pharmacologically active concentrations were achieved at all doses. Dose-related linear increases in area under the concentration-time curve were seen on day 1, with no significant accumulation on day 15. Mean terminal half-life was 1 to 4 days, and mean time to peak concentration ranged from 5 to 9 hours. SB1518 inhibited JAK2 signaling at 4 hours postdose at all levels. Increases in fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT-3) ligand, reflecting FLT-3 inhibition, were seen in most patients. There were three partial responses (≥300 mg/d) and 15 patients with stable disease (SD), with most responses lasting longer than 2 months. Seven of 13 SDs had tumor reductions of 4% to 46%.

Noncanonical regulation of the Hedgehog mediator GLI1 by c-MYC in Burkitt lymphoma.,Molecular cancer research : MCR,Mol. Cancer Res.,2013-03-22,"Although Hedgehog signaling plays a major role in GLI1 transcription, there is now evidence suggesting that other pathways/genes, such as c-MYC, may also regulate GLI1 expression. We initiated studies in Burkitt lymphoma cells, which constitutively express c-MYC due to a chromosomal translocation, to determine whether Hedgehog or c-MYC regulates GLI1 expression. We show that all Burkitt lymphoma cell lines tested express GLI1, PTCH1, and SMO and that five of six Burkitt lymphomas express GLI1. Exposure to Sonic or Indian Hedgehog or cyclopamine (SMO inhibitor) does not modulate GLI1 expression, cell proliferation, or apoptosis in most Burkitt lymphoma cell lines. Sequence analysis of PTCH1, SMO, and SuFu failed to show mutations that might explain the lack of Hedgehog responsiveness, and we did not detect primary cilia, which may contribute to it. We show that c-MYC interacts with the 5'-regulatory region of GLI1, using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, and E-box-dependent transcriptional activation of GLI1 by c-MYC in NIH3T3 and HeLa cells. The c-MYC small-molecule inhibitor 10058-F4 downregulates GLI1 mRNA and protein and reduces the viability of Burkitt lymphoma cells. Inhibition of GLI1 by GANT61 increases apoptosis and reduces viability of some Burkitt lymphoma cells.

PD-L1 expression is characteristic of a subset of aggressive B-cell lymphomas and virus-associated malignancies.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2013-05-14,"Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is an immunomodulatory molecule expressed by antigen-presenting cells and select tumors that engages receptors on T cells to inhibit T-cell immunity. Immunotherapies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway have shown durable antitumor effects in a subset of patients with solid tumors. PD-L1 can be expressed by Reed-Sternberg cells comprising classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) and by malignant B cells comprising EBV-positive posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD). We sought to determine whether the expression of PD-L1 represents a general strategy of immune evasion among aggressive B-cell lymphomas and virus- and immunodeficiency-associated tumors. Using novel antibodies and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue biopsies, we examined 237 primary tumors for expression of PD-L1. Robust PD-L1 protein expression was found in the majority of nodular sclerosis and mixed cellularity CHL, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma, EBV-positive and -negative PTLD, and EBV-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), plasmablastic lymphoma, extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and HHV8-associated primary effusion lymphoma. Within these tumors, PD-L1 was highly expressed by malignant cells and tumor-infiltrating macrophages. In contrast, neither the malignant nor the nonmalignant cells comprising nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, DLBCL-not otherwise specified, Burkitt lymphoma, and HHV8-associated Kaposi sarcoma expressed detectable PD-L1. Certain aggressive B-cell lymphomas and virus- and immunodeficiency-associated malignancies associated with an ineffective T-cell immune response express PD-L1 on tumor cells and infiltrating macrophages. These results identify a group of neoplasms that should be considered for PD-1/PD-L1-directed therapies, and validate methods to detect PD-L1 in FFPE tissue biopsies.",Journal Article,2443.0,407.0,Programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1 is an immunomodulatory molecule expressed by antigen-presenting cells and select tumors that engages receptors on T cells to inhibit T-cell immunity Immunotherapies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway have shown durable antitumor effects in a subset of patients with solid tumors PD-L1 can be expressed by Reed-Sternberg cells comprising classical CHL and by malignant B cells comprising EBV-positive posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders PTLD We sought to determine whether the expression of PD-L1 represents a general strategy of immune evasion among aggressive B-cell lymphomas and virus- and immunodeficiency-associated tumors Using novel antibodies and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded FFPE tissue biopsies we examined 237 primary tumors for expression of PD-L1 Robust PD-L1 protein expression was found in the majority of nodular sclerosis and mixed cellularity CHL primary mediastinal large B-cell T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell EBV-positive and -negative PTLD and EBV-associated diffuse large B-cell DLBCL plasmablastic extranodal NK/T-cell carcinoma and HHV8-associated primary effusion Within these tumors PD-L1 was highly expressed by malignant cells and tumor-infiltrating macrophages In contrast neither the malignant nor the nonmalignant cells comprising nodular lymphocyte-predominant DLBCL-not otherwise specified and HHV8-associated Kaposi expressed detectable PD-L1 Certain aggressive B-cell lymphomas and virus- and immunodeficiency-associated malignancies associated with an ineffective T-cell immune response express PD-L1 on tumor cells and infiltrating macrophages These results identify a group of neoplasms that should be considered for PD-1/PD-L1-directed therapies and validate methods to detect PD-L1 in FFPE tissue biopsies,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1846, 31, 273, 1232, 14, 333, 729, 16, 35, 2555, 1354, 570, 20, 448, 1656, 37, 2, 1717, 57, 17, 20410, 1186, 23, 102, 37, 6, 1433, 102, 31, 1604, 2811, 529, 3, 333, 14, 333, 729, 308, 47, 443, 1480, 579, 176, 4, 8, 697, 1, 7, 5, 537, 57, 333, 729, 122, 40, 570, 20, 10599, 10890, 37, 3538, 3781, 5352, 2, 20, 393, 132, 37, 3538, 2672, 109, 7346, 4192, 1997, 10709, 21, 990, 6, 223, 317, 3, 55, 1, 333, 729, 1449, 8, 1083, 692, 1, 250, 5351, 107, 571, 132, 31, 1557, 2, 1450, 2, 5323, 41, 57, 75, 229, 890, 2, 3265, 1959, 2487, 2505, 4412, 246, 1154, 21, 409, 7296, 86, 57, 9, 55, 1, 333, 729, 1922, 333, 729, 178, 55, 10, 204, 4, 3, 686, 1, 4481, 7426, 2, 1739, 6363, 5352, 86, 2626, 375, 132, 31, 102, 31, 23515, 3697, 132, 31, 2672, 109, 2, 199, 10709, 2, 2672, 41, 1388, 375, 132, 31, 1446, 14433, 4093, 1765, 102, 31, 134, 2, 15225, 41, 86, 4433, 262, 46, 57, 333, 729, 10, 561, 570, 20, 393, 37, 2, 30, 2097, 2748, 4, 748, 2174, 3, 393, 2110, 3, 5967, 37, 3538, 4481, 1448, 2750, 1446, 44, 2632, 3575, 2, 15225, 41, 7574, 570, 2083, 333, 729, 1840, 571, 132, 31, 1557, 2, 1450, 2, 5323, 41, 441, 41, 5, 35, 3957, 102, 31, 250, 51, 1669, 333, 729, 23, 30, 37, 2, 2097, 2748, 46, 99, 255, 8, 87, 1, 1179, 17, 257, 40, 515, 9, 333, 14, 333, 729, 1166, 235, 2, 2183, 636, 6, 1426, 333, 729, 4, 4412, 246, 1154]",1792.0,23674495,56
CXCR5 polymorphisms in non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk and prognosis.,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",Cancer Immunol. Immunother.,2013-06-28,"CXCR5 [chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 5; also known as Burkitt lymphoma receptor 1 (BCR1)] is expressed on mature B-cells, subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and skin-derived migratory dendritic cells. Together with its ligand, CXCL13, CXCR5 is involved in guiding B-cells into the B-cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs as well as T-cell migration. This study evaluated the role of common germline genetic variation in CXCR5 in the risk and prognosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) using a clinic-based study of 1,521 controls and 2,694 NHL cases including 710 chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, 586 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 588 follicular lymphoma (FL), 137 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), 230 marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), and 158 peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). Of the ten CXCR5 tag SNPs in our study, five were associated with risk of NHL, with rs1790192 having the strongest association (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08-1.30; p = 0.0003).

Prognostic factors were identified in a multivariate model for relative survival (RS), and trends in survival were evaluated using period analysis. The study cohort included 2284 patients, with a median age of 49 years and male predominance (2.6:1). Gastrointestinal tract and the head and neck were the most common sites of extranodal disease. Older age, black race/ethnicity, and advanced stage were associated with a worse survival. In the period analysis, trends in improved survival between 1998 and 2009 were seen, except for patients older than 60 years and black patients, whose survival did not improve. A prognostic score divided patients into 4 groups: low-risk (5-year RS: 71%), low-intermediate (5-year RS: 55%), high-intermediate (5-year RS: 41%), and high-risk (5-year RS: 29%; P  < .001).

Isolation and analysis of linker histones across cellular compartments.,Journal of proteomics,J Proteomics,2013-09-05,"Analysis of histones, especially histone H1, is severely limited by immunological reagent availability. This paper describes the application of cellular fractionation with LC-MS for profiling histones in the cytosol and upon chromatin. First, we show that linker histones enriched by cellular fractionation gives less nuclear contamination and higher histone content than when prepared by nuclei isolation. Second, we profiled the soluble linker histones throughout the cell cycle revealing phosphorylation increases as cells reach mitosis. Finally, we monitored histone H1.2-H1.5 translocation to the cytosol in response to the CDK inhibitor flavopiridol in primary CLL cells treated ex vivo. Data shows that all H1 variants translocate in response to drug treatment with no specific order to their cytosolic appearance. The results illustrate the utility of cellular fractionation in conjunction with LC-MS for the analysis of histone H1 throughout the cell. This paper demonstrates the first time application of cellular fractionation to characterize cytosolic histone H1 by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Using the Ramos Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, cellular fractionation was shown to give less nuclear contamination and higher histone content than preparations by nuclei isolation. Further application of the cellular fractionation approach was shown by using primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells to monitor the movement of histone H1 across cellular compartments in response to the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol.

Complete response to induction therapy in patients with Myc-positive and double-hit non-Hodgkin lymphoma is associated with prolonged progression-free survival.,Cancer,Cancer,2014-02-27,"Myc-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with or without a B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) rearrangement is associated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). In this study, the authors reviewed the outcomes of patients with myc-positive and double-hit NHL at The Ohio State University. All patients who had non-Burkitt, aggressive B-cell NHL from 2008 to 2011 were assessed for the t(14;18) translocation and for v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (CMYC) rearrangements at diagnosis, and all myc-positive patients were included in the current analysis. Associations with clinical characteristics were described, and univariable and multivariable models were used to assess correlations between clinical variables and outcomes. Of 49 myc-positive patients, 29 patients also had BCL2 rearrangements (double-hit NHL). No patients underwent autologous stem cell transplantation in first remission. For all myc-positive patients, the median PFS was 16.6 months, and the median OS was 37.7 months. For patients who had double-hit NHL, the median PFS was 8 months, and the median OS was 12.5 months; whereas the median PFS and OS were not reached for myc-positive patients.

"MYC-associated and double-hit lymphomas: a review of pathobiology, prognosis, and therapeutic approaches.",Cancer,Cancer,2014-07-24,"Aberrant expression of the v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC) proto-oncogene has known transformative potential in healthy human cells. Chromosomal MYC rearrangements and consequent MYC overexpression is the defining lesion in Burkitt lymphoma (BL), conferring a highly proliferative state. However, abnormalities of MYC are increasingly appreciated in non-BL histologies, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and B-cell lymphomas intermediate between BL and DLBCL, with a particularly aggressive clinical phenotype. Although there are conflicting data regarding prognostic implications of isolated MYC aberrancy in these non-BLs, the co-occurrence of MYC rearrangements and either the antiapoptotic gene B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) or the transcriptional repressor BCL6 leads to an entity termed double-hit B-cell lymphoma (DHL) (or triple-hit if all 3 abnormalities are observed) with a particularly poor prognosis and no established treatment paradigms. Notably, a distinct pattern of gene expression profiling has been noted when MYC is overexpressed in BL compared with other lymphomas, supporting the notion that, although MYC promotes target gene transcription, the target genes vary by disease subtype. The frequency of MYC activity depends on the method of detection and ranges from 5% to 10% using fluorescence in situ hybridization but up to 30% of DLBCL using immunohistochemistry. Standard therapies developed for DLBCL are less effective when the disease is driven by MYC, leading to lower response rates and response durations. An important clinical challenge is to pre-emptively identify MYC-associated lymphomas and to subsequently develop trials specifically for this group of patients. However, the design of such studies is complicated by variable definitions of MYC-associated lymphoid malignancies and the lack of effective therapies to date. The objective if the current review was to evaluate the implications of MYC aberrancy with respect to the B-cell lymphoma double-hit and triple-hit phenotypes and to consider the available data for clinical and practical management.",Journal Article,2007.0,71.0,Aberrant expression of the v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog MYC proto-oncogene has known transformative potential in healthy human cells Chromosomal MYC rearrangements and consequent MYC overexpression is the defining lesion in BL conferring a highly proliferative state However abnormalities of MYC are increasingly appreciated in non-BL histologies including diffuse large B-cell DLBCL and B-cell lymphomas intermediate between BL and DLBCL with a particularly aggressive clinical phenotype Although there are conflicting data regarding prognostic implications of isolated MYC aberrancy in these non-BLs the co-occurrence of MYC rearrangements and either the antiapoptotic gene B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 BCL2 or the transcriptional repressor BCL6 leads to an entity termed double-hit B-cell DHL or triple-hit if all 3 abnormalities are observed with a particularly poor prognosis and no established treatment paradigms Notably a distinct pattern of gene expression profiling has been noted when MYC is overexpressed in BL compared with other lymphomas supporting the notion that although MYC promotes target gene transcription the target genes vary by disease subtype The frequency of MYC activity depends on the method of detection and ranges from 5 to 10 using fluorescence in situ hybridization but up to 30 of DLBCL using immunohistochemistry Standard therapies developed for DLBCL are less effective when the disease is driven by MYC leading to lower response rates and response durations An important clinical challenge is to pre-emptively identify MYC-associated lymphomas and to subsequently develop trials specifically for this group of patients However the design of such studies is complicated by variable definitions of MYC-associated lymphoid malignancies and the lack of effective therapies to date The objective if the current review was to evaluate the implications of MYC aberrancy with respect to the B-cell double-hit and triple-hit phenotypes and to consider the available data for clinical and practical management,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[1898, 55, 1, 3, 603, 1371, 16811, 29107, 1667, 1836, 3412, 1371, 4976, 1836, 71, 440, 16947, 174, 4, 1331, 171, 37, 1860, 1371, 2072, 2, 8436, 1371, 851, 16, 3, 2847, 1180, 4, 6331, 7209, 8, 561, 2441, 1309, 137, 1171, 1, 1371, 32, 1635, 7292, 4, 220, 6331, 3489, 141, 1388, 375, 132, 31, 1446, 2, 132, 31, 1557, 919, 59, 6331, 2, 1446, 5, 8, 823, 571, 38, 1005, 242, 125, 32, 4274, 74, 666, 177, 1268, 1, 1355, 1371, 25193, 4, 46, 220, 27385, 3, 1269, 2291, 1, 1371, 2072, 2, 361, 3, 4176, 145, 132, 31, 442, 1193, 2647, 4763, 18, 3214, 15, 3, 1431, 7434, 8148, 1940, 6, 35, 2983, 4183, 1627, 6519, 132, 31, 7384, 15, 1500, 6519, 492, 62, 27, 1171, 32, 164, 5, 8, 823, 334, 356, 2, 77, 635, 24, 4887, 2552, 8, 834, 1177, 1, 145, 55, 1080, 71, 85, 1051, 198, 1371, 16, 1711, 4, 6331, 72, 5, 127, 1557, 1912, 3, 6691, 17, 242, 1371, 2148, 283, 145, 866, 3, 283, 214, 2825, 20, 34, 875, 3, 675, 1, 1371, 128, 3828, 23, 3, 596, 1, 638, 2, 5632, 29, 33, 6, 79, 75, 1591, 4, 957, 1554, 84, 126, 6, 201, 1, 1446, 75, 888, 260, 235, 276, 9, 1446, 32, 299, 323, 198, 3, 34, 16, 1621, 20, 1371, 1049, 6, 280, 51, 151, 2, 51, 4864, 35, 305, 38, 1745, 16, 6, 671, 40704, 255, 1371, 41, 1557, 2, 6, 1611, 690, 143, 1225, 9, 26, 87, 1, 7, 137, 3, 771, 1, 225, 94, 16, 4286, 20, 1347, 3833, 1, 1371, 41, 2303, 441, 2, 3, 926, 1, 323, 235, 6, 1244, 3, 461, 492, 3, 291, 206, 10, 6, 376, 3, 1268, 1, 1371, 25193, 5, 2184, 6, 3, 132, 31, 1627, 6519, 2, 1500, 6519, 2618, 2, 6, 2419, 3, 390, 74, 9, 38, 2, 3320, 284]",2077.0,25060588,3

Etiologic heterogeneity among non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes: the InterLymph Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Subtypes Project.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Monographs,J. Natl. Cancer Inst. Monographs,2014-08-01,"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) comprises biologically and clinically heterogeneous subtypes. Previously, study size has limited the ability to compare and contrast the risk factor profiles among these heterogeneous subtypes. We pooled individual-level data from 17 471 NHL cases and 23 096 controls in 20 case-control studies from the International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium (InterLymph). We estimated the associations, measured as odds ratios, between each of 11 NHL subtypes and self-reported medical history, family history of hematologic malignancy, lifestyle factors, and occupation. We then assessed the heterogeneity of associations by evaluating the variability (Q value) of the estimated odds ratios for a given exposure among subtypes. Finally, we organized the subtypes into a hierarchical tree to identify groups that had similar risk factor profiles. Statistical significance of tree partitions was estimated by permutation-based P values (P NODE). Risks differed statistically significantly among NHL subtypes for medical history factors (autoimmune diseases, hepatitis C virus seropositivity, eczema, and blood transfusion), family history of leukemia and multiple myeloma, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and certain occupations, whereas generally homogeneous risks among subtypes were observed for family history of NHL, recreational sun exposure, hay fever, allergy, and socioeconomic status. Overall, the greatest difference in risk factors occurred between T-cell and B-cell lymphomas (P NODE < 1.0×10(-4)), with increased risks generally restricted to T-cell lymphomas for eczema, T-cell-activating autoimmune diseases, family history of multiple myeloma, and occupation as a painter. We further observed substantial heterogeneity among B-cell lymphomas (P NODE < 1.0×10(-4)).

Inhibition of methyltransferases accelerates degradation of cFLIP and sensitizes B-cell lymphoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2015-03-04,"Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) are characterized by specific abnormalities that alter cell cycle regulation, DNA damage response, and apoptotic signaling. It is believed that cancer cells are particularly sensitive to cell death induced by tumor necrosis factor α-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). However, many cancer cells show blocked TRAIL signaling due to up-regulated expression of anti-apoptotic factors, such as cFLIP. This hurdle to TRAIL's tumor cytotoxicity might be overcome by combining TRAIL-based therapy with drugs that reverse blockages of its apoptotic signaling. In this study, we investigated the impact of a pan-methyltransferase inhibitor (3-deazaneplanocin A, or DZNep) on TRAIL-induced apoptosis in aggressive B-cell NHLs: mantle cell, Burkitt, and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. We characterized TRAIL apoptosis regulation and caspase activation in several NHL-derived cell lines pre-treated with DZNep. We found that DZNep increased cancer cell sensitivity to TRAIL signaling by promoting caspase-8 processing through accelerated cFLIP degradation. No change in cFLIP mRNA level indicated independence of promoter methylation alterations in methyltransferase activity induced by DZNep profoundly affected cFLIP mRNA stability and protein stability. This appears to be in part through increased levels of cFLIP-targeting microRNAs (miR-512-3p and miR-346). However, additional microRNAs and cFLIP-regulating mechanisms appear to be involved in DZNep-mediated enhanced response to extrinsic apoptotic stimuli. The capacity of DZNep to target cFLIP expression on multiple levels underscores DZNep's potential in TRAIL-based therapies for B-cell NHLs.

We added rituximab, reduced and/or rescheduled cyclophosphamide and methotrexate, capped vincristine, and used combination intrathecal chemotherapy. Antibiotic prophylaxis and growth factor support were required; highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was discretionary. Thirteen AIDS Malignancy Consortium centers enrolled 34 patients from 2007 to 2010. Median age was 42 years (range, 19-55 years), 32 of 34 patients were high risk, 74% had stage III to IV BL and CD4 count of 195 cells per μL (range, 0-721 cells per μL), and 5 patients (15%) had CD4 <100 cells per μL. Twenty-six patients were receiving HAART; viral load was <100 copies per mL in 12 patients. Twenty-seven patients had at least one grade 3 to 5 toxicity, including 20 hematologic, 14 infectious, and 6 metabolic. None had grade 3 to 4 mucositis. Five patients did not complete treatments because of adverse events. Eleven patients died, including 1 treatment-related and 8 disease-related deaths.

"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype distribution, geodemographic patterns, and survival in the US: A longitudinal analysis of the National Cancer Data Base from 1998 to 2011.",American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2015-07-27,"The World Health Organization classification of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) was introduced in 2001. However, its incorporation into clinical practice is not well-described. We studied the distribution of NHL subtypes in adults diagnosed from 1998 to 2011, evaluated time trends, geo-demographic correlates, and changes in 5-year overall survival (OS). We obtained data prospectively collected by the National Cancer Data Base, which covers 70% of US cancer cases. There were 596,476 patients diagnosed with NHL. The major subtypes were diffuse large B-cell (32.5%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL; 18.6%), follicular (17.1%), marginal zone (8.3%), mantle cell (4.1%), peripheral T-cell not-otherwise-specified (1.7%), Burkitt (1.6%), hairy cell (1.1%), lymphoplasmacytic (1.1%), and NHL not-otherwise-specified (10.8%). Over the study period, the proportion of NHL not-otherwise-specified declined by half, while marginal zone lymphoma doubled.

Phase II study of an AKT inhibitor MK2206 in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma.,British journal of haematology,Br. J. Haematol.,2015-07-27,"We conducted a phase II study of the AKT inhibitor, MK2206 in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma of any histology excluding Burkitt lymphoma or lymphoblastic lymphoma. MK-2206 was administered orally at 200 mg once weekly in 28-d cycles up to 12 cycles in the absence of progression or significant toxicity. The dose was adjusted based on tolerance. A total of 59 patients were enrolled. The final doses patients received were 300 mg (n = 33), 250 mg (n = 2), 200 mg (n = 16) and 135 mg (n = 8). Based on intent-to-treat analysis, objective response was observed in 8 (14%) patients (2 complete response and 6 partial response), with median response duration of 5·8 months. The overall response rate was 20% in 25 patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Rash was the most common toxicity (any grade 53%, Grade 3 in 15%) and was observed in a dose-dependent manner. The correlative cytokine analysis showed paradoxical increase in several cytokines, which may be explained by negative feedback mechanism induced by the on-target effect of AKT inhibitor. Our data demonstrate that MK2206 has a favourable safety profile with a modest activity in patients with relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma.

"Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in Children and Adolescents: Progress Through Effective Collaboration, Current Knowledge, and Challenges Ahead.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2015-08-24,"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is the fourth most common malignancy in children, has an even higher incidence in adolescents, and is primarily represented by only a few histologic subtypes. Dramatic progress has been achieved, with survival rates exceeding 80%, in large part because of a better understanding of the biology of the different subtypes and national and international collaborations. Most patients with Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are cured with short intensive pulse chemotherapy containing cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, and high-dose methotrexate. The benefit of the addition of rituximab has not been established except in the case of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. Lymphoblastic lymphoma is treated with intensive, semi-continuous, longer leukemia-derived protocols. Relapses in B-cell and lymphoblastic lymphomas are rare and infrequently curable, even with intensive approaches. Event-free survival rates of approximately 75% have been achieved in anaplastic large-cell lymphomas with various regimens that generally include a short intensive B-like regimen. Immunity seems to play an important role in prognosis and needs further exploration to determine its therapeutic application. ALK inhibitor therapeutic approaches are currently under investigation. For all pediatric lymphomas, the intensity of induction/consolidation therapy correlates with acute toxicities, but because of low cumulative doses of anthracyclines and alkylating agents, minimal or no long-term toxicity is expected. Challenges that remain include defining the value of prognostic factors, such as early response on positron emission tomography/computed tomography and minimal disseminated and residual disease, using new biologic technologies to improve risk stratification, and developing innovative therapies, both in the first-line setting and for relapse.

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in Southern Africa: review of 487 cases from The International Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Classification Project.,British journal of haematology,Br. J. Haematol.,2015-12-21,"Comparative data on the distribution of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes in Southern Africa (SAF) is scarce. In this study, five expert haematopathologists classified 487 consecutive cases of NHL from SAF using the World Health Organization classification, and compared the results to North America (NA) and Western Europe (WEU). Southern Africa had a significantly lower proportion of low-grade (LG) B-NHL (34·3%) and a higher proportion of high-grade (HG) B-NHL (51·5%) compared to WEU (54·5% and 36·4%) and NA (56·1% and 34·3%). High-grade Burkitt-like lymphoma was significantly more common in SAF (8·2%) than in WEU (2·4%) and NA (2·5%), most likely due to human immunodeficiency virus infection. When SAF patients were divided by race, whites had a significantly higher frequency of LG B-NHL (60·4%) and a lower frequency of HG B-NHL (32·7%) compared to blacks (22·5% and 62·6%), whereas the other races were intermediate.

"Lenalidomide, Thalidomide, and Pomalidomide Reactivate the Epstein-Barr Virus Lytic Cycle through Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Signaling and Ikaros Expression.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2016-06-13,"Lenalidomide, thalidomide, and pomalidomide (LTP) are immunomodulatory agents approved for use in multiple myeloma, but in some settings, especially with alkylating agents, an increase in Hodgkin lymphoma and other secondary primary malignancies (SPM) has been noted. Some of these malignancies have been linked to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), raising the possibility that immunomodulatory drugs disrupt latent EBV infection. We studied the ability of LTP to reactivate latently infected EBV-positive cell lines in vitro and in vivo, and evaluated the EBV viral load in archived serum samples from patients who received a lenalidomide, thalidomide, and dexamethasone (LTD) combination. Treatment of EBV-infected B-cell lines with LTP at physiologically relevant concentrations induced the immediate early gene BZLF1, the early gene BMRF1, and the late proteins VCA and BCFR1. This occurred in the potency order pomalidomide > lenalidomide > thalidomide, and the nucleoside analogue ganciclovir enhanced the cytotoxic effects of lenalidomide and pomalidomide in Burkitt lymphoma cells in vitro and in vivo EBV reactivation was related to PI3K stimulation and Ikaros suppression, and blocked by the PI3Kδ inhibitor idelalisib. Combinations of lenalidomide with dexamethasone or rituximab increased EBV reactivation compared with lenalidomide alone and, importantly, lenalidomide with melphalan produced even greater reactivation. We conclude LTP may reactivate EBV-positive resting memory B cells thereby enhancing EBV lytic cycle and host immune suppression.

Simultaneous inhibition of Vps34 kinase would enhance PI3Kδ inhibitor cytotoxicity in the B-cell malignancies.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2016-08-01,"PI3Kδ has been found to be over-expressed in B-Cell-related malignancies. Despite the clinical success of the first selective PI3Kδ inhibitor, CAL-101, inhibition of PI3Kδ itself did not show too much cytotoxic efficacy against cancer cells. One possible reason is that PI3Kδ inhibition induced autophagy that protects the cells from death. Since class III PI3K isoform PIK3C3/Vps34 participates in autophagy initiation and progression, we predicted that a PI3Kδ and Vps34 dual inhibitor might improve the anti-proliferative activity observed for PI3Kδ-targeted inhibitors. We discovered a highly potent ATP-competitive PI3Kδ/Vps34 dual inhibitor, PI3KD/V-IN-01, which displayed 10-1500 fold selectivity over other PI3K isoforms and did not inhibit any other kinases in the kinome. In cells, PI3KD/V-IN-01 showed 30-300 fold selectivity between PI3Kδ and other class I PI3K isoforms. PI3KD/V-IN-01 exhibited better anti-proliferative activity against AML, CLL and Burkitt lymphoma cell lines than known selective PI3Kδ and Vps34 inhibitors.

B-Cell Lymphoma Patient-Derived Xenograft Models Enable Drug Discovery and Are a Platform for Personalized Therapy.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2017-03-27,"<b>Purpose:</b> Patients with B-cell lymphomas often relapse after frontline therapy, and novel therapies are urgently needed to provide long-term remission. We established B-cell lymphoma patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models to assess their ability to mimic tumor biology and to identify B-cell lymphoma patient treatment options.<b>Experimental Design:</b> We established the PDX models from 16 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, or Burkitt lymphoma by inoculating the patient tumor cells into a human bone chip implanted into mice. We subjected the PDX models to histopathologic and phenotypical examination, sequencing, and drug efficacy analysis. Primary and acquired resistance to ibrutinib, an oral covalent inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase, were investigated to elucidate the mechanisms underlying ibrutinib resistance and to identify drug treatments to overcome resistance.<b>Results:</b> The PDXs maintained the same biological, histopathologic, and immunophenotypical features, retained similar genetic mutations, and produced comparable drug responses with the original patient tumors. In the acquired ibrutinib-resistant PDXs, PLC-γ2, p65, and Src were downregulated; however, a PI3K signaling pathway member was upregulated. Inactivation of the PI3K pathway with the inhibitor idelalisib in combination with ibrutinib significantly inhibited the growth of the ibrutinib-resistant tumors. Furthermore, we used a PDX model derived from a clinically ibrutinib-relapsed patient to evaluate various therapeutic choices, ultimately eliminating the tumor cells in the patient's peripheral blood.<b>Conclusions:</b> Our results demonstrate that the B-cell lymphoma PDX model is an effective system to predict and personalize therapies and address therapeutic resistance in B-cell lymphoma patients. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(15); 4212-23. ©2017 AACR</i>.",Journal Article,1030.0,14.0,b Purpose /b Patients with B-cell lymphomas often relapse after frontline therapy and novel therapies are urgently needed to provide long-term remission We established B-cell patient-derived xenograft PDX models to assess their ability to mimic tumor biology and to identify B-cell patient treatment options. b Experimental Design /b We established the PDX models from 16 patients with diffuse large B-cell mantle cell follicular marginal zone or by inoculating the patient tumor cells into a human chip implanted into mice We subjected the PDX models to histopathologic and phenotypical examination sequencing and drug efficacy analysis Primary and acquired resistance to ibrutinib an oral covalent inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase were investigated to elucidate the mechanisms underlying ibrutinib resistance and to identify drug treatments to overcome resistance. b Results /b The PDXs maintained the same biological histopathologic and immunophenotypical features retained similar genetic mutations and produced comparable drug responses with the original patient tumors In the acquired ibrutinib-resistant PDXs PLC-γ2 p65 and Src were downregulated however a PI3K signaling pathway member was upregulated Inactivation of the PI3K pathway with the inhibitor idelalisib in combination with ibrutinib significantly inhibited the growth of the ibrutinib-resistant tumors Furthermore we used a PDX model derived from a clinically ibrutinib-relapsed patient to evaluate various therapeutic choices ultimately eliminating the tumor cells in the patient 's peripheral blood. b Conclusions /b Our results demonstrate that the B-cell PDX model is an effective system to predict and personalize therapies and address therapeutic resistance in B-cell patients i Clin Cancer Res 23 15 4212-23 ©2017 AACR /i,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[132, 743, 132, 7, 5, 132, 31, 1557, 629, 429, 50, 3171, 36, 2, 229, 235, 32, 5354, 575, 6, 377, 319, 337, 734, 21, 635, 132, 31, 69, 526, 1330, 3250, 274, 6, 423, 136, 801, 6, 5356, 30, 891, 2, 6, 255, 132, 31, 69, 24, 838, 132, 1560, 771, 132, 21, 635, 3, 3250, 274, 29, 245, 7, 5, 1388, 375, 132, 31, 2757, 31, 1974, 3450, 3614, 15, 20, 33290, 3, 69, 30, 37, 237, 8, 171, 4222, 3416, 237, 399, 21, 4325, 3, 3250, 274, 6, 2630, 2, 36393, 1385, 615, 2, 234, 209, 65, 86, 2, 1294, 251, 6, 1795, 35, 518, 10747, 230, 1, 5796, 564, 216, 11, 565, 6, 3061, 3, 483, 1181, 1795, 251, 2, 6, 255, 234, 640, 6, 1768, 251, 132, 99, 132, 3, 5987, 1955, 3, 827, 1037, 2630, 2, 23613, 404, 3532, 288, 336, 138, 2, 1687, 1279, 234, 253, 5, 3, 2279, 69, 57, 4, 3, 1294, 1795, 436, 5987, 13064, 31713, 6781, 2, 2023, 11, 3315, 137, 8, 974, 314, 308, 2693, 10, 2684, 2297, 1, 3, 974, 308, 5, 3, 230, 7083, 4, 150, 5, 1795, 97, 879, 3, 129, 1, 3, 1795, 436, 57, 798, 21, 95, 8, 3250, 202, 526, 29, 8, 505, 1795, 591, 69, 6, 376, 747, 189, 5218, 2050, 6923, 3, 30, 37, 4, 3, 69, 292, 672, 315, 132, 2130, 132, 114, 99, 608, 17, 3, 132, 31, 3250, 202, 16, 35, 323, 398, 6, 678, 2, 8346, 235, 2, 1539, 189, 251, 4, 132, 31, 7, 70, 2459, 12, 1936, 382, 167, 70103, 382, 3194, 1630, 70]",1801.0,28348046,70

B Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma With Burkitt-like Morphology and IGH/MYC Rearrangement: Report of 3 Cases in Adult Patients.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2018-02-01,"Isolated MYC rearrangement without other recurrent genetic abnormalities is rare in B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL/LBL), with most cases reported in pediatric patients. We report 3 adult cases with lymphoblasts showing a precursor B cell immunophenotype, and isolated MYC/IGH translocation. All 3 cases occurred in male patients with initial presentation of diffuse lymphadenopathy. Cases 1 and 2 had B-ALL with significantly increased lymphoblasts in peripheral blood and bone marrow. Case 3, a patient with human immunodeficiency virus infection, had the diagnosis of B-LBL made on a retroperitoneal lymph node biopsy and had no peripheral blood or bone marrow involvement. The leukemic and lymphoma cells in all 3 cases demonstrated Burkitt lymphoma-like morphology with deeply basophilic cytoplasm and numerous cytoplasmic vacuoles. However, all 3 had immature immunophenotypes including expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), absence of BCL6, and dim-to-negative CD45. CD20 was largely negative in 2 of 3 cases.

Genome-wide discovery of somatic coding and noncoding mutations in pediatric endemic and sporadic Burkitt lymphoma.,Blood,Blood,2019-01-07,"Although generally curable with intensive chemotherapy in resource-rich settings, Burkitt lymphoma (BL) remains a deadly disease in older patients and in sub-Saharan Africa. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positivity is a feature in more than 90% of cases in malaria-endemic regions, and up to 30% elsewhere. However, the molecular features of BL have not been comprehensively evaluated when taking into account tumor EBV status or geographic origin. Through an integrative analysis of whole-genome and transcriptome data, we show a striking genome-wide increase in aberrant somatic hypermutation in EBV-positive tumors, supporting a link between EBV and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AICDA) activity. In addition to identifying novel candidate BL genes such as <i>SIN3A</i>, <i>USP7</i>, and <i>CHD8</i>, we demonstrate that EBV-positive tumors had significantly fewer driver mutations, especially among genes with roles in apoptosis. We also found immunoglobulin variable region genes that were disproportionally used to encode clonal B-cell receptors (BCRs) in the tumors. These include IGHV4-34, known to produce autoreactive antibodies, and IGKV3-20, a feature described in other B-cell malignancies but not yet in BL. Our results suggest that tumor EBV status defines a specific BL phenotype irrespective of geographic origin, with particular molecular properties and distinct pathogenic mechanisms. The novel mutation patterns identified here imply rational use of DNA-damaging chemotherapy in some patients with BL and targeted agents such as the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in others, whereas the importance of BCR signaling in BL strengthens the potential benefit of inhibitors for PI3K, Syk, and Src family kinases among these patients.",Journal Article,379.0,18.0,Although generally curable with intensive chemotherapy in resource-rich settings BL remains a deadly disease in older patients and in sub-Saharan Africa Epstein-Barr virus EBV positivity is a feature in more than 90 of cases in malaria-endemic regions and up to 30 elsewhere However the molecular features of BL have not been comprehensively evaluated when taking into account tumor EBV status or geographic origin Through an integrative analysis of whole-genome and transcriptome data we show a striking genome-wide increase in aberrant somatic hypermutation in EBV-positive tumors supporting a link between EBV and activation-induced cytidine deaminase AICDA activity In addition to identifying novel candidate BL genes such as i SIN3A /i i USP7 /i and i CHD8 /i we demonstrate that EBV-positive tumors had significantly fewer driver mutations especially among genes with roles in apoptosis We also found immunoglobulin variable region genes that were disproportionally used to encode clonal B-cell receptors BCRs in the tumors These include IGHV4-34 known to produce autoreactive antibodies and IGKV3-20 a feature described in other B-cell malignancies but not yet in BL Our results suggest that tumor EBV status defines a specific BL phenotype irrespective of geographic origin with particular molecular properties and distinct pathogenic mechanisms The novel mutation patterns identified here imply rational use of DNA-damaging chemotherapy in some patients with BL and targeted agents such as the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in others whereas the importance of BCR signaling in BL strengthens the potential benefit of inhibitors for PI3K Syk and Src family kinases among these patients,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[242, 1228, 4151, 5, 1686, 56, 4, 3069, 3697, 1947, 6331, 469, 8, 6610, 34, 4, 434, 7, 2, 4, 551, 17196, 8171, 5212, 5190, 1450, 2672, 1887, 16, 8, 2705, 4, 80, 76, 424, 1, 140, 4, 74271, 15483, 1374, 2, 126, 6, 201, 7116, 137, 3, 219, 404, 1, 6331, 47, 44, 85, 5627, 194, 198, 2727, 237, 1967, 30, 2672, 156, 15, 3466, 1938, 298, 35, 4324, 65, 1, 902, 898, 2, 3917, 74, 21, 514, 8, 5133, 898, 1019, 344, 4, 1898, 1119, 13521, 4, 2672, 109, 57, 1912, 8, 3460, 59, 2672, 2, 363, 277, 12783, 10197, 41466, 128, 4, 352, 6, 1386, 229, 1609, 6331, 214, 225, 22, 70, 21855, 70, 70, 35788, 70, 2, 70, 40577, 70, 21, 608, 17, 2672, 109, 57, 42, 97, 1497, 2228, 138, 1093, 107, 214, 5, 1790, 4, 351, 21, 120, 204, 2593, 1347, 1053, 214, 17, 11, 20708, 95, 6, 6924, 1946, 132, 31, 1186, 34371, 4, 3, 57, 46, 643, 40421, 562, 440, 6, 2410, 28526, 890, 2, 34306, 179, 8, 2705, 1027, 4, 127, 132, 31, 441, 84, 44, 1145, 4, 6331, 114, 99, 309, 17, 30, 2672, 156, 5849, 8, 112, 6331, 1005, 3500, 1, 3466, 1938, 5, 1454, 219, 1571, 2, 834, 2806, 483, 3, 229, 258, 764, 108, 467, 8360, 2696, 119, 1, 261, 4904, 56, 4, 476, 7, 5, 6331, 2, 238, 183, 225, 22, 3, 3254, 49, 230, 4895, 4, 1749, 547, 3, 1187, 1, 1062, 314, 4, 6331, 18436, 3, 174, 247, 1, 222, 9, 974, 6792, 2, 2023, 607, 1549, 107, 46, 7]",1692.0,30617194,63
