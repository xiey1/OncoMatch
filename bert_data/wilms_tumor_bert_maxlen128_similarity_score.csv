Patterns of abdominal relapse and role of sonography in Wilms tumor.,Pediatric hematology and oncology,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,2002-03-01,"This study characterizes the patterns of abdominal recurrence of Wilms tumor and describes the role of sonography in its detection. Twelve patients who had initial tumor recurrence in the abdomen were evaluated. Five patients had recurrence in the kidney; all had nephrogenic rests detected by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging but not by sonography. The remaining 7 patients had recurrence in the peritoneum (4), the nephrectomy site (2), or the regional lymph nodes (1); tumor spillage had occurred in five of these patients. Four recurrences were detected during therapy, and eight within 3 years after completion of therapy. Seven of the 12 recurrences were first detected by sonography. All 11 sonograms obtained at the time of relapse showed tumor recurrence. Nine patients died a median of 10 months after relapse. The results suggest that regular sonographic surveillance for 3 years after therapy is likely to reveal most abdominal recurrences.

C-kit expression in pediatric solid tumors: a comparative immunohistochemical study.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2002-04-01,"The stem cell factor/c-kit tyrosine kinase receptor pathway has been shown to be important for tumor growth and progression in several cancers, including mast cell diseases, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, acute myeloid leukemia, small cell lung carcinoma, and Ewing sarcoma. Studies using the oral agent STI-571 (Gleevec, Novartis), an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases bcr-abl, c-kit, and PDGFR, have shown significant responses in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumor. With the aim of identifying additional groups of tumors that may use the stem cell factor/c-kit pathway and secondarily may be responsive to STI-571 treatment, this study surveyed 151 primary tumors from patients treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital for immunohistochemical expression of c-kit. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were stained with rabbit polyclonal anti-human c-kit (CD117, Dako) using standard avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique, antigen retrieval, and an automated stainer. Strong, diffuse staining for c-kit was seen in a proportion of synovial sarcomas, osteosarcomas, and Ewing sarcomas. Strong, diffuse staining was less common in neuroblastomas, Wilms' tumors, and rhabdomyosarcomas and was negative in alveolar soft part sarcomas and desmoplastic small round cell tumors.

Improved survival for patients with recurrent Wilms tumor: the experience at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol.,,"Reported estimates of survival for patients with recurrent Wilms tumor are 24% to 43%. Because published survival data are more than a decade old and do not reflect advances in therapy, the authors reviewed their experience in treating recurrent Wilms tumor to determine whether the probability of survival has increased. The authors reviewed the cases of 54 patients with recurrent Wilms tumor who were treated on one of six consecutive clinical trials at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital between 1969 and 2000. Five-year overall survival estimates after relapse were 63.6 +/- 15.7% for patients treated during or after 1984 (n = 20) and 20.6 +/- 6.5% for patients treated before 1984 (n = 34) (P = 0.002). When the analysis was restricted to patients with high-risk clinical features, 5-year overall survival estimates were 47.6 +/- 15.7% for those treated in the modern era (n = 16) and 11.1 +/- 5.2% for those treated in the earlier era (n = 25) (P = 0.005). Only three patients received high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue; one survived. No patients with recurrent anaplastic histology disease survived.

We reviewed pregnancy outcomes among survivors of Wilms tumor treated with or without irradiation to the flank or tumor bed on National Wilms Tumor Studies 1, 2, 3, and 4 using a maternal questionnaire and review of both maternal and offspring medical records. We received reports regarding 427 pregnancies with duration of 20 weeks or longer, including 409 liveborn singletons for whom 309 sets of medical records were reviewed. Malposition of the fetus and early or threatened labor were more frequent among irradiated women. Both were more frequent among women who received higher radiation therapy doses. The offspring of the irradiated female patients were more likely to weigh less than 2,500 g at birth and to be of less than 36 weeks gestation, with both being more frequent after higher doses of radiation. An increased percentage of offspring of irradiated females had one or more congenital malformations. Women who receive flank radiation therapy as part of their treatment for Wilms tumor are at increased risk of fetal malposition and premature labor. The offspring of these women are at risk for low birthweight, premature (< 36 weeks gestation) birth, and the occurrence of congenital malformations.

Downregulation of Wilms' tumor 1 protein inhibits breast cancer proliferation.,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.,2002-07-01,"High levels of Wilms' Tumor 1 (WT1) mRNA have been correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. However, the function of WT1 protein in breast cancer is not known. We observed that the levels of WT1 protein correlated with the proliferation of breast cancer cells. When the proliferation of breast cancer cells was stimulated by 17beta-estradiol, WT1 protein expression increased. But when the proliferation of breast cancer cells was inhibited by tamoxifen or all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), WT1 protein expression decreased. We hypothesize that WT1 protein plays a role in regulating breast cancer cell proliferation. Using liposome-incorporated WT1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, we found that downregulation of WT1 protein expression led to breast cancer growth inhibition and reduced cyclin D1 protein levels.

Novel targeted and immunotherapeutic strategies in chronic myeloid leukemia.,Seminars in hematology,Semin. Hematol.,2003-01-01,"The advanced understanding of the molecular biology and immunology of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has led to novel therapeutic strategies unique to this disease. CML responds to immune-mediated therapies, including stem cell transplantation, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), and interferon alfa. T cells and other immune effectors are implicated in the mechanisms of action of these immune therapies. Recently, clinical observations supported by laboratory data have demonstrated the presence of CML-specific T cells in patients. Several proteins may potentially act as leukemia-specific antigens for major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted cytotoxicity in CML, and active specific therapies (vaccines) are in development. Antigens under investigation include bcr-abl, PR1, Wilms tumor protein (WT1), minor histocompatibility antigens (mH), CML-66, CML-28, and survivin.

Par-4 transcriptionally regulates Bcl-2 through a WT1-binding site on the bcl-2 promoter.,The Journal of biological chemistry,J. Biol. Chem.,2003-03-17,"Elevated expression levels of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene have been extensively correlated with the appearance of androgen independence in prostate cancer. Although bcl-2 was first cloned as the t(14:18) translocation breakpoint from human follicular B cell lymphoma, the mechanism of overexpression of bcl-2 is largely undefined for advanced prostate cancer because there are no gross alterations in the gene structure. We investigated the role of the product of the prostate apoptosis response gene-4 (Par-4) and the product of the Wilms' tumor 1 gene (WT1) in the regulation of Bcl-2 expression in prostate cancer cell lines. We observed growth arrest and apoptosis, upon decreasing Bcl-2 protein and transcript in the high Bcl-2-expressing, androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line, by all-trans-retinoic acid treatment (ATRA), but this did not occur in the androgen-dependent cell line expressing low levels of Bcl-2. The decrease in the Bcl-2 protein and transcript following all-trans-retinoic acid treatment was accompanied by changes in localization of Par-4 and an induction in the expression of WT1 protein. In stable clones expressing ectopic Par-4 and in ATRA-treated cells, we observed decreased Bcl-2 protein and transcript. This was accompanied by an induction in WT1 expression. The involvement of WT1 in the Par-4-mediated down-modulation of Bcl-2 was further defined by blocking endogenous WT1 expression, which resulted in an increase in Bcl-2 expression. Finally, we detected Par-4 and WT1 proteins binding to a previously identified WT1-binding site on the bcl-2 promoter both in vitro and in vivo leading to a decrease in transcription from the bcl-2 promoter. We conclude that Par-4 regulates Bcl-2 through a WT1-binding site on the bcl-2 promoter. These data also identify Par-4 nuclear localization as a novel mechanism for ATRA-mediated bcl-2 regulation.",Journal Article,6154.0,84.0,Elevated expression levels bcl-2 proto-oncogene extensively correlated appearance androgen independence prostate bcl-2 cloned 14:18 translocation breakpoint human follicular B lymphoma mechanism overexpression bcl-2 largely undefined advanced prostate gross alterations structure investigated role product prostate apoptosis response gene-4 Par-4 product Wilms 1 WT1 regulation Bcl-2 expression prostate lines observed growth arrest apoptosis decreasing Bcl-2 transcript high Bcl-2-expressing androgen-independent prostate line all-trans-retinoic acid treatment ATRA occur androgen-dependent line expressing low levels Bcl-2 decrease Bcl-2 transcript following all-trans-retinoic acid treatment accompanied changes localization Par-4 induction expression WT1 stable clones expressing ectopic Par-4 ATRA-treated observed decreased Bcl-2 transcript accompanied induction WT1 expression involvement WT1 Par-4-mediated down-modulation Bcl-2 defined blocking endogenous WT1 expression resulted increase Bcl-2 expression Finally detected Par-4 WT1 binding previously identified WT1-binding site bcl-2 promoter vitro vivo leading decrease transcription bcl-2 promoter conclude Par-4 regulates Bcl-2 WT1-binding site bcl-2 promoter identify Par-4 nuclear localization novel mechanism ATRA-mediated bcl-2 regulation,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[804, 55, 148, 1, 3, 1044, 18, 4976, 1836, 47, 85, 3576, 438, 5, 3, 3592, 1, 687, 5773, 4, 12, 242, 1044, 18, 10, 157, 8560, 22, 3, 102, 213, 203, 2006, 8567, 29, 171, 1974, 132, 31, 3, 670, 1, 851, 1, 1044, 18, 16, 1733, 5425, 9, 131, 12, 408, 125, 32, 77, 1789, 593, 4, 3, 145, 2772, 21, 565, 3, 200, 1, 3, 2821, 1, 3, 351, 51, 145, 39, 7112, 39, 2, 3, 2821, 1, 3, 30, 14, 145, 3722, 4, 3, 863, 1, 1044, 18, 55, 4, 12, 31, 285, 21, 164, 129, 1854, 2, 351, 1548, 2777, 1044, 18, 178, 2, 3268, 4, 3, 64, 1044, 18, 1046, 687, 306, 12, 31, 328, 20, 62, 3437, 3887, 971, 24, 2822, 84, 26, 205, 44, 1271, 4, 3, 687, 470, 31, 328, 1046, 154, 148, 1, 1044, 18, 3, 775, 4, 3, 1044, 18, 178, 2, 3268, 366, 62, 3437, 3887, 971, 24, 10, 2756, 20, 400, 4, 2145, 1, 7112, 39, 2, 35, 504, 4, 3, 55, 1, 3722, 178, 4, 585, 2749, 1046, 3647, 7112, 39, 2, 4, 2822, 73, 37, 21, 164, 340, 1044, 18, 178, 2, 3268, 26, 10, 2756, 20, 35, 504, 4, 3722, 55, 3, 799, 1, 3722, 4, 3, 7112, 39, 517, 1328, 2356, 1, 1044, 18, 10, 195, 395, 20, 2521, 2682, 3722, 55, 92, 627, 4, 35, 344, 4, 1044, 18, 55, 1368, 21, 530, 7112, 39, 2, 3722, 652, 791, 6, 8, 373, 108, 3722, 791, 606, 23, 3, 1044, 18, 973, 110, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 1049, 6, 8, 775, 4, 866, 29, 3, 1044, 18, 973, 21, 2060, 17, 7112, 39, 2468, 1044, 18, 298, 8, 3722, 791, 606, 23, 3, 1044, 18, 973, 46, 74, 120, 255, 7112, 39, 928, 2145, 22, 8, 229, 670, 9, 2822, 517, 1044, 18, 863]",1797.0,12644474,Par-4 transcriptionally regulates Bcl-2 WT1-binding site bcl-2 promoter,0,0.0
Outcome of children with cystic partially differentiated nephroblastoma treated with or without chemotherapy.,Journal of pediatric surgery,J. Pediatr. Surg.,2003-06-01,"Cystic partially differentiated nephroblastoma (CPDN) is a rare variant of Wilms' tumor thought to be more favorable than standard nephroblastoma. The purpose of this report is to examine the outcome of children with CPDN, after nephrectomy, treated with vincristine and dactinomycin based chemotherapy (+/- doxorubicin) or no chemotherapy. Patients were registered with the National Wilms' Tumor Study Group (NWTSG) and data were collected prospectively. All patients had central review by the NWTSG Pathology Center to confirm the diagnosis of CPDN. Twenty-one patients were identified with a diagnosis of CPDN. Thirteen patients received chemotherapy, and 8 patients did not. In the chemotherapy group the stage distribution was as follows: stage I (n = 10), stage II (n = 2), stage V (n = 1). In the no-chemotherapy group, all 8 patients were stage I. All patients had complete tumor resection. There were no cases of disease progression or recurrence in any patient. In patients receiving chemotherapy, 30% (n = 4) had toxicities causing dose reduction. The outcome of patients with CPDN is favorable with 100% survival rate and no recurrences.

Influence of radiation therapy delay on abdominal tumor recurrence in patients with favorable histology Wilms' tumor treated on NWTS-3 and NWTS-4: a report from the National Wilms' Tumor Study Group.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2003-10-01,"This study was undertaken to determine whether radiation therapy (RT) delay of >or=10 days had an adverse impact on abdominal tumor recurrence among children with favorable histology (FH) Wilms' tumor enrolled in National Wilms' Tumor Study (NWTS) 3 and 4. A total of 1226 patients with Stage II-IV FH tumors who received flank or abdominal RT in NWTS-3 and NWTS-4 were included in this analysis. Recurrent disease in the operative bed was classified as flank recurrence. Abdominal recurrence included all infradiaphragmatic tumor recurrences, including flank recurrences. This analysis included all flank/abdominal tumor recurrences, regardless of whether they might have been the initial or subsequent site of relapse. Based on the NWTS-1 results, RT delay was analyzed in two categories: 0-9 days and >or=10 days. The mean RT delay was 10.9 days; median delay was 9 days (range: 1-277 days). The RT delay was concentrated in a relatively narrow range of 8 to 12 days after nephrectomy in the majority of patients (59%). Univariate and multivariate analysis did not reveal RT delay of >or=10 days to significantly influence flank and abdominal tumor recurrence rates in NWTS-3 or NWTS-4. The 8-year flank tumor recurrence rates for 0-9 days and 10+ days RT delay were 1.9% and 1.2%, respectively (p value = 0.3). The 8-year abdominal tumor recurrence rates for 0-9 days and 10+ days RT delay were 4.8% and 5.3%, respectively (p value = 0.7). RT delay of >or=10 days did not significantly influence flank or abdominal tumor recurrence rates among children with FH tumors treated on NWTS-3 and NWTS-4.

Recent advances in pediatric renal neoplasia.,Advances in anatomic pathology,Adv Anat Pathol,2003-09-01,"Over the past 6 years, molecular genetic studies have significantly advanced our understanding of pediatric renal neoplasms. The cellular variant of congenital mesoblastic nephroma (but not the classic variant) has been shown to bear the same t(12;15)(p13;q25) and ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion as infantile fibrosarcoma, a tumor with which it shares morphologic and clinical features. Rhabdoid tumor of the kidney is characterized by deletion of the hSNF5/INI1 gene, which links it to other rhabdoid tumors of infancy that arise in the soft tissue and brain. Primary renal synovial sarcomas and renal primitive neuroectodermal tumors have become accepted entities, and likely comprise a subset of what had previously been termed ""adult Wilms tumor."" Renal carcinomas associated with Xp11.2 translocations that result in fusions involving the TFE3 transcription factor gene have been delineated, including a distinctive neoplasm that shares the identical gene fusion as alveolar soft part sarcoma.

Thyroid carcinoma presenting in childhood or after treatment of childhood malignancies: An institutional experience and review of the literature.,Journal of pediatric surgery,J. Pediatr. Surg.,2003-11-01,"Thyroid carcinomas can occur as a primary malignancy (PTM) or secondary after another malignancy (STM). Information about the presentations and outcomes of patients with STM are limited. The authors sought to compare the clinical characteristics, course, and outcomes of patients with primary or secondary thyroid malignancies. The authors reviewed the medical records of 8 children with PTM and 17 children with STM referred to St Jude Children's Research Hospital between February 1962 and February 2002 for evaluation and treatment of malignant thyroid carcinoma. The 8 children who had primary thyroid carcinoma had it diagnosed at a median age of 12.5 years (range, 7.3 to 16.3 years). Seven patients had papillary carcinoma, and 1 patient had follicular carcinoma. Three of the 8 (37.5%) had metastatic disease involving regional lymph nodes; 2 patients (25.0%) had lung metastases. Six patients required radioactive iodine (I 131) ablation for residual or metastatic disease after surgical resection. All 8 patients remain alive a median of 22.6 years after diagnosis (range, 0.7 to 30.5 years); 1 continues to receive radioactive iodine (I 131) ablation for persistent disease. Seventeen patients had thyroid carcinoma as a second malignant neoplasm after treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 6), Hodgkin's disease (n = 5), central nervous system tumor (n = 2), Wilms' tumor (n = 1), retinoblastoma (n = 1), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 1), or neuroblastoma (n = 1). Patients with secondary thyroid carcinoma presented at a median age of 21.5 years (range, 15.3 to 42.6 years), a median of 16.2 years (range, 0.9 to 29.2 years) after diagnosis of the primary cancer. Twelve of the 17 patients (70.6%) had received radiation to the thyroid gland during therapy for the primary cancer. Four patients (23.5%) had metastatic disease involving regional lymph nodes. Six patients (35.3%) required I(131) ablation for residual or metastatic disease after thyroidectomy. At the time of this report, all 17 patients are alive and in continue to be free of disease. Pediatric thyroid carcinoma is uncommon and responds well to current therapy. Given the limited period of follow-up of our cohort of secondary malignant thyroid tumors that arise after childhood cancer, these lesions appear to have similar presentations and outcomes when compared with primary carcinomas and can therefore be managed in the same manner.",Journal Article,5925.0,60.0,Thyroid carcinomas occur primary malignancy PTM secondary malignancy STM Information presentations outcomes patients STM limited authors sought compare clinical characteristics course outcomes patients primary secondary thyroid malignancies authors reviewed medical records 8 children PTM 17 children STM referred St Jude Children 's Research Hospital February 1962 February 2002 evaluation treatment malignant thyroid carcinoma 8 children primary thyroid carcinoma diagnosed median age 12.5 years range 7.3 16.3 years Seven patients papillary carcinoma 1 patient follicular carcinoma 8 37.5 metastatic disease involving regional lymph nodes 2 patients 25.0 lung metastases patients required radioactive iodine 131 ablation residual metastatic disease surgical resection 8 patients remain alive median 22.6 years diagnosis range 0.7 30.5 years 1 continues receive radioactive iodine 131 ablation persistent disease Seventeen patients thyroid carcinoma second malignant neoplasm treatment acute lymphoblastic leukemia n 6 Hodgkin 's disease n 5 central nervous n 2 Wilms n 1 retinoblastoma n 1 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma n 1 neuroblastoma n 1 Patients secondary thyroid carcinoma presented median age 21.5 years range 15.3 42.6 years median 16.2 years range 0.9 29.2 years diagnosis primary 17 patients 70.6 received radiation thyroid gland therapy primary patients 23.5 metastatic disease involving regional lymph nodes patients 35.3 required 131 ablation residual metastatic disease thyroidectomy time report 17 patients alive continue free disease Pediatric thyroid carcinoma uncommon responds current therapy Given limited period follow-up cohort secondary malignant thyroid arise childhood lesions appear similar presentations outcomes compared primary carcinomas managed manner,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[826, 122, 1271, 22, 8, 86, 710, 23207, 15, 568, 50, 1809, 710, 20338, 487, 545, 3, 4261, 2, 123, 1, 7, 5, 20338, 32, 383, 3, 738, 990, 6, 932, 3, 38, 374, 906, 2, 123, 1, 7, 5, 86, 15, 568, 441, 3, 738, 446, 3, 484, 1064, 1, 66, 541, 5, 23207, 2, 269, 541, 5, 20338, 1995, 6, 3062, 4841, 541, 292, 389, 702, 59, 3010, 14754, 2, 3010, 1544, 9, 451, 2, 24, 1, 393, 134, 3, 66, 541, 54, 42, 86, 134, 42, 192, 265, 28, 8, 52, 89, 1, 133, 33, 60, 184, 67, 27, 6, 245, 27, 60, 648, 7, 42, 1796, 134, 2, 14, 69, 42, 1974, 134, 169, 1, 3, 66, 567, 33, 42, 113, 34, 1267, 951, 263, 502, 18, 7, 243, 13, 42, 196, 437, 7, 616, 4741, 4287, 70, 2229, 1650, 9, 753, 15, 113, 34, 50, 221, 170, 62, 66, 7, 918, 1701, 8, 52, 1, 350, 49, 60, 50, 147, 184, 13, 67, 6, 201, 33, 60, 14, 2274, 6, 560, 4741, 4287, 70, 2229, 1650, 9, 1882, 34, 3591, 7, 42, 134, 22, 8, 419, 393, 2131, 50, 24, 9, 286, 1275, 78, 49, 292, 34, 78, 33, 854, 1880, 398, 30, 78, 18, 30, 78, 14, 78, 14, 292, 78, 14, 15, 78, 14, 7, 5, 568, 134, 917, 28, 8, 52, 89, 1, 239, 33, 60, 184, 167, 27, 6, 595, 49, 60, 8, 52, 1, 245, 18, 60, 184, 13, 83, 6, 462, 18, 60, 50, 147, 1, 3, 86, 12, 2544, 1, 3, 269, 7, 431, 49, 42, 103, 121, 6, 3, 2326, 190, 36, 9, 3, 86, 12, 294, 7, 382, 33, 42, 113, 34, 1267, 951, 263, 502, 437, 7, 465, 27, 616, 70, 2229, 1650, 9, 753, 15, 113, 34, 50, 5949, 28, 3, 98, 1, 26, 414, 62, 269, 7, 32, 1701, 2, 4, 1906, 6, 40, 115, 1, 34, 815, 134, 16, 2052, 2, 7920, 149, 6, 291, 36, 447, 3, 383, 727, 1, 166, 126, 1, 114, 180, 1, 568, 393, 57, 17, 3043, 50, 864, 12, 46, 406, 1322, 6, 47, 288, 4261, 2, 123, 198, 72, 5, 86, 826, 2, 122, 673, 40, 2231, 4, 3, 827, 1708]",2184.0,14614703,Thyroid carcinoma presenting childhood treatment childhood malignancies institutional experience review literature,1,0.007194244604316547
Association of biallelic BRCA2/FANCD1 mutations with spontaneous chromosomal instability and solid tumors of childhood.,Blood,Blood,2003-12-11,"The clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular findings of 2 Fanconi anemia (FA) subtype D1 kindreds, initially identified through a young child with a solid tumor (medullobastoma, Wilms tumor), are described. Each kindred subsequently had a second affected child; one developed Wilms tumor followed by a medulloblastoma, and the other developed T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Cytogenetic studies revealed an unusually high spontaneous chromosome aberration rate, contrasting with other FA subtypes. Molecular analysis revealed biallelic BRCA2/FANCD1 mutations. The patients did not exhibit bone marrow failure. Our studies suggest that the D1 subtype represents a severe end of the cytogenetic spectrum within FA, consistent with a critical downstream role of BRCA2 in the FA pathway. Furthermore, this FA subgroup may be preferentially associated with an increased predisposition to solid tumors in early childhood. Recognition of this constellation of findings has significant implications for medical management and genetic counseling of FA families.",Journal Article,5885.0,132.0,clinical cytogenetic molecular findings 2 Fanconi anemia FA subtype D1 kindreds initially identified young child solid medullobastoma Wilms described kindred subsequently second affected child developed Wilms followed medulloblastoma developed T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia Cytogenetic studies revealed unusually high spontaneous chromosome aberration rate contrasting FA subtypes Molecular revealed biallelic BRCA2/FANCD1 patients exhibit bone marrow failure studies suggest D1 subtype represents severe end cytogenetic spectrum FA consistent critical downstream role BRCA2 FA pathway Furthermore FA subgroup preferentially associated increased predisposition solid early childhood Recognition constellation findings significant implications medical management genetic counseling FA families,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 38, 1266, 2, 219, 272, 1, 18, 8057, 1545, 4307, 875, 2146, 10141, 1625, 108, 298, 8, 1169, 2566, 5, 8, 537, 30, 53897, 30, 32, 1027, 296, 16706, 1611, 42, 8, 419, 1424, 2566, 104, 276, 30, 370, 20, 8, 2714, 2, 3, 127, 276, 102, 2542, 286, 1275, 1266, 94, 553, 35, 15499, 64, 3280, 1170, 7794, 116, 14116, 5, 127, 4307, 814, 219, 65, 553, 6435, 1167, 30398, 138, 3, 7, 205, 44, 2239, 581, 496, 114, 94, 309, 17, 3, 2146, 875, 1449, 8, 905, 396, 1, 3, 1266, 1873, 262, 4307, 925, 5, 8, 740, 1489, 200, 1, 1167, 4, 3, 4307, 308, 798, 26, 4307, 1363, 68, 40, 3509, 41, 5, 35, 101, 2863, 6, 537, 57, 4, 191, 864, 2335, 1, 26, 13862, 1, 272, 71, 93, 1268, 9, 484, 284, 2, 336, 2011, 1, 4307, 1954]",1009.0,14670928,Association biallelic BRCA2/FANCD1 spontaneous chromosomal instability solid childhood,3,0.02158273381294964

Effect of duration of treatment on treatment outcome for patients with clear-cell sarcoma of the kidney: a report from the National Wilms' Tumor Study Group.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2004-02-01,"To evaluate the effect of conventional and standard (ST) versus pulse-intensive (PI) chemotherapy and short-duration versus long-duration chemotherapy on relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival rates of patients with clear-cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK) entered onto the National Wilms' Tumor Study (NWTS)-4. The 5-year and 8-year RFS rates were determined for patients with CCSK treated on the NWTS-4. After August 6, 1986, 40 previously untreated children younger than 16 years with CCSK were randomly assigned, after the completion of 6 months of chemotherapy, to discontinue (short) or continue 9 additional months (long) of treatment with chemotherapy regimens that included vincristine and either divided-dose (ST) courses (5 days) or single-dose (PI) treatment with dactinomycin and divided-dose (ST) courses (3 days) or single-dose (PI) treatment with doxorubicin. For patients with CCSK, the 5- and 8-year RFS rates were 65.2% and 60.6%, respectively, for patients randomly assigned to the short chemotherapy and 87.8% (both 5- and 8-year RFS) for patients randomly assigned to the long chemotherapy (P =.08). The overall survival rates for patients at 5 and 8 years were 95.5% and 85.9%, respectively, for the short chemotherapy and 87.5% (both 5- and 8-year overall survival) for the long chemotherapy (P =.99).

Pregnancy outcomes after abdominal irradiation that included or excluded the pelvis in childhood Wilms tumor survivors: a report from the National Wilms Tumor Study.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2004-04-01,"This report describes the pregnancy outcomes among 7 survivors of childhood Wilms tumor, who were treated on one of the National Wilms Tumor Studies (NWTS) with radiation therapy (RT) portals that extended beyond the flank. Pregnancy outcomes among female survivors of childhood Wilms tumor treated with abdominal irradiation in NWTS 1-4 were analyzed as part of the long-term follow-up study. Medical records and maternal questionnaires were used to gather information on pregnancy outcomes. A total of 130 patients received abdominal RT and survived to at least 15 years of age. Seven patients (5.4%) had at least 1 recorded pregnancy. The extent of RT fields was ascertained in 126 patients. For 4 patients, the extent of RT fields could not be determined. Twelve girls received RT using portals that included the upper abdomen but not the entire pelvis. Ten pregnancies were recorded in 5 of these patients; 9 resulted in live births, and 1 resulted in a miscarriage. One hundred fourteen girls received RT using portals that included the entire abdomen and pelvis. The abdominal RT dose distribution among these 114 patients was as follows: 9 received 0-10.49 Gy, 22 patients received 10.5-14.99 Gy, and 83 patients received 15+ Gy. Four pregnancies were recorded in 2 of these patients. After 21 Gy to the abdomen and pelvis in 1 patient, all 3 pregnancies resulted in miscarriages and fetal deaths. However, after 10.5 Gy, a normal live birth was reported in the other patient. Pregnancy-related complications were also more common if the RT portals included the pelvis. Fertility can be preserved in children with Wilms tumor after upper abdominal RT (10-20 Gy) that does not include the entire pelvis. In rare instances, fertility can be preserved after low-dose whole-abdominal RT (10.5 Gy). The indications and dosages for RT currently used have been greatly refined compared to NWTS-1 and NWTS-2. Childhood Wilms tumor survivors should be considered to be at a high risk for infertility and pregnancy-related complications during their reproductive years.

Clin. Oncol.,2004-07-01,"To investigate whether high-dose therapy with hematopoietic stem-cell rescue (HSCR) will improve survival for patients with relapsed Wilms' tumor. Thirteen children with relapsed Wilms' tumor were treated with one or two cycles of high-dose chemotherapy (HDT) followed by autologous HSCR. Twelve of 13 patients received reinduction chemotherapy before HDT and HSCR. The median age at diagnosis was 4.8 years, and the median time to relapse was 12 months. The histology was favorable in 12 of 13 patients. The ablative regimens included: (1) thiotepa (TT)/cyclophosphamide (CTX)/carboplatin (CP; n = 2); (2) TT/CTX (n = 5); (3) TT/etoposide (ETP; n = 1); and (4) CP/ETP/CTX (n = 1). Four patients received two cycles of HDT and HSCR. Cycle 1 consisted of CP/ETP/CTX, and melphalan/CTX were used in cycle 2. Seven of 13 patients are alive without evidence of disease, with a median follow-up of 30 months. The 4-year estimated event-free survival (EFS) rate is 60% (95% CI, 0.40 to 6.88), and the overall survival (OS) at 4 years is 73% (95% CI, 0.40 to 6.86). There was no transplant-related mortality.

"Doxorubicin for favorable histology, Stage II-III Wilms tumor: results from the National Wilms Tumor Studies.",Cancer,Cancer,2004-09-01,"After randomized trials in the 1980s, doxorubicin (DOX) was added to dactinomycin plus vincristine as standard chemotherapy for patients who had Stage III Wilms tumor (WT) of favorable histology (FH). Double-agent chemotherapy was retained for patients with Stage II disease. In this study, the authors reevaluated the efficacy of DOX using extended follow-up and additional patients. The relative risks (RR) (DOX vs. no DOX) of disease recurrence and mortality were estimated for patients with Stage II-III/FH WT who were enrolled in the third and fourth National Wilms Tumor Studies (NWTS-3 and NWTS-4). The risk of congestive heart failure (CHF) was estimated for all patients who received DOX. No statistically significant effects of DOX were found for patients with Stage II tumors. For patients with Stage III tumors, the 8 year recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates for randomized patients on NWTS-3 were 84% and 89%, respectively, for patients who received DOX (n = 130) and 74% and 83%, respectively, for patients who did not receive DOX (n = 118). Including all patients with Stage III disease who received DOX (n = 678) and did not receive DOX (n = 138), the RRs of recurrence were 0.47 (P = 0.007) and 0.40 (P = 0.011), and local recurrence respectively, after adjustment for radiation therapy (RT) dose, whereas the RR of mortality adjusted for RT and study was 0.68 (P = 0.17).

IGF-1 and prostate cancer.,Novartis Foundation symposium,Novartis Found. Symp.,2004-01-01,"By virtue of their potent proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects, the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) have been the subject of long-term scrutiny for their role in tumorigenesis. With regard to prostate cancer in particular, IGF-1 has been shown to stimulate the proliferation of human prostate epithelial cells in culture and to be necessary for normal growth and development of the rat and mouse prostate. Epidemiological studies have established a link between high circulating serum IGF-1 levels and the risk of later developing advanced prostate cancer, and overexpression of IGF-1 in the prostate basal epithelial layer of transgenic mice results in prostate adenocarcinoma that is similar to human disease. Thus, IGF-1 action appears to be important for prostate cancer initiation. On the other hand, decreased IGF action, subsequent to the down-regulation of IGF-1 receptor expression, is associated with advanced, metastatic disease. This decrease in IGF-1 receptor may confer a survival advantage to prostate cancer cells that have entered the circulation by making them resistant to the differentiative effects of IGF-1 at metastatic sites such as bone. The molecular mechanisms that effect IGF-1 receptor down-regulation appear to involve novel oncogenic functions of the Wilms' tumour suppressor, as well as novel actions of the androgen receptor.",Journal Article,5864.0,18.0,virtue potent proliferative anti-apoptotic effects insulin-like growth factors IGFs subject long-term scrutiny role tumorigenesis regard prostate particular IGF-1 shown stimulate proliferation human prostate epithelial culture necessary normal growth development rat mouse prostate Epidemiological studies established link high circulating serum IGF-1 levels risk later developing advanced prostate overexpression IGF-1 prostate basal epithelial layer transgenic mice prostate adenocarcinoma similar human disease IGF-1 action appears important prostate initiation hand decreased IGF action subsequent down-regulation IGF-1 receptor expression associated advanced metastatic disease decrease IGF-1 receptor confer survival advantage prostate entered circulation making resistant differentiative effects IGF-1 metastatic sites bone molecular mechanisms effect IGF-1 receptor down-regulation appear involve novel oncogenic functions Wilms tumour suppressor novel actions androgen receptor,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[20, 15955, 1, 136, 1157, 2441, 2, 312, 1631, 176, 3, 1601, 733, 129, 130, 12714, 47, 85, 3, 2974, 1, 319, 337, 11323, 9, 136, 200, 4, 1565, 5, 2539, 6, 12, 4, 1454, 1273, 14, 71, 85, 443, 6, 4223, 3, 457, 1, 171, 701, 37, 4, 2099, 2, 6, 40, 1493, 9, 295, 129, 2, 193, 1, 3, 4008, 2, 830, 4614, 94, 47, 635, 8, 3460, 59, 64, 1033, 524, 1273, 14, 148, 2, 3, 43, 1, 1559, 931, 131, 12, 2, 851, 1, 1273, 14, 4, 3, 2135, 701, 8056, 1, 2862, 399, 99, 4, 449, 17, 16, 288, 6, 171, 34, 631, 1273, 14, 1578, 1233, 6, 40, 305, 9, 12, 1118, 23, 3, 127, 2833, 340, 1273, 1578, 706, 6, 3, 1328, 863, 1, 1273, 14, 153, 55, 16, 41, 5, 131, 113, 34, 26, 775, 4, 1273, 14, 153, 68, 2913, 8, 25, 1874, 6, 12, 37, 17, 47, 2836, 3, 4984, 20, 1079, 1370, 436, 6, 3, 30434, 176, 1, 1273, 14, 28, 113, 633, 225, 22, 3, 219, 483, 17, 254, 1273, 14, 153, 1328, 863, 1322, 6, 3882, 229, 1302, 1681, 1, 3, 770, 1245, 22, 149, 22, 229, 5592, 1, 3, 687, 153]",1263.0,15562830,IGF-1 prostate,3,0.02158273381294964

Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2004-12-01,"To describe the clinical outcomes in adults with favorable histologic type (FH) Wilms tumor (WT) registered in the National Wilms Tumor Studies (NWTS) 4-5. We also describe the results of patients treated in the ""modern era"" (1979-2001) with surgical staging, central pathology review and stage-appropriate multimodality treatment. Twenty-three adult patients (> or =16 years of age) with FHWT after central pathology review were registered on NWTS 4-5. The tumor stage distribution was Stage I in 5, Stage II in 8, Stage III in 6, and Stage IV in 4 patients. All patients underwent primary nephrectomy followed by multiagent chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (RT). All patients underwent tumor stage-based chemotherapy that generally followed existing NWTS Group (NWTSG) protocols. To analyze the outcomes of adult patients treated in the ""modern era,"" the data from this report were combined with the data from 22 patients with FHWT previously reported in 1990 by the NWTSG. The 5-year relapse-free survival, overall survival, and disease-specific survival (DSS) rate was 77.3%, 82.6%, and 95.7%, respectively, for patients registered in the NWTS 4-5 protocols. Three patients (13%) died of chemotherapy-induced hepatic venoocclusive disease. For a total of 45 adults with FHWTs treated in the ""modern era,"" the overall survival rate was 82%. The survival rate for those with Stage I, II, III, and IV disease was 100%, 92%, 70%, and 73%, respectively. Of the 12 Stage I-II patients treated with two drugs and no RT, the survival rate was 100%. The survival rate for Stage III and IV patients treated with three drugs and RT was 63% and 70%, respectively. The results of this report demonstrate that adults with FHWT treated with a multimodality approach similar to NWTSG protocols have good survival. We recommend that all adult patients be treated with stage-appropriate combined modality therapy, and furthermore, be entered in current Children's Oncology Group WT protocols so that coherent data can be gathered for this relatively rare tumor.

Body mass index in long-term adult survivors of childhood cancer: a report of the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,Cancer,Cancer,2005-04-01,"The goals of the current study were to determine the distribution of body mass index (BMI) of survivors of common pediatric malignancies and to identify factors associated with abnormal BMI. The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) is a multicenter cohort study of >/= 5-year survivors of pediatric cancer diagnosed between 1970 and 1986. Self-reported heights and weights were used to calculate BMI for 7195 adult survivors, compared with population-based, age-specific, and gender-specific norms from the 1995 National Health Interview Survey. Underweight was defined as a BMI < 18.5 kg/m(2) and obese as BMI >/= 30 kg/m(2). Survivors of leukemia were more likely to be obese (females: odds ratio [OR] = 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-1.8; males: OR = 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.5). Survivors more likely to be underweight included female and male survivors of Hodgkin disease (OR = 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.3 and OR = 3.5; 95% CI, 2.3-5.3) and Wilms tumor (OR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.8 and OR = 5.5; 95% CI, 3.1-9.7), female survivors of bone carcinoma without amputation (OR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-2.9), and male survivors of leukemia (OR = 2.4; 95% CI, 1.6-3.6), brain tumors (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6-4.4), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR = 3.1; 95% CI, 1.9-5.2), neuroblastoma (OR = 4.9; 95% CI, 2.48-10.0), and soft tissue sarcoma (OR = 3.5; 95% CI, 2.0-6.0). In females, treatment with total body irradiation, alkylating agents, and anthracyclines and in males, treatment with abdominal radiation, younger age at treatment, and treatment with anthracyclines and alkylating agents were associated with being underweight. Underweight survivors were more likely to report adverse health and major medical conditions.

Treatment-related factors have been shown to have an impact on subsequent health status and quality of life, although there are limited data on survivors who are now 2 or more decades past treatment. The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) was established as a resource for investigating the long-term outcomes of a cohort of 5-year survivors of pediatric and adolescent cancer, who were diagnosed between 1970 and 1986. The CCSS consists of more than 14,000 active participants, including survivors of leukemia, brain tumors, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Wilms' tumor, neuroblastoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, and bone tumors, who have provided self-reported sociodemographicand health-related information. The survivor population has been found to be at increased risk of a broad spectrum of adverse outcomes, such as late mortality, second cancers, pulmonary complications, pregnancy loss, giving birth to offspring with low birth weights, and decreased educational attainment. The ongoing evaluation of large and diverse cohorts of cancer survivors, through resources such as the CCSS, will aid in further identifying high-risk individuals who should be the target of innovative intervention strategies.",Journal Article,5408.0,41.0,"Improvements treatment occurring children adolescents resulted large number patients achieving long-term survival Treatment-related factors shown impact subsequent health status quality life limited survivors 2 decades past treatment Childhood Survivor CCSS established resource investigating long-term outcomes cohort 5-year survivors pediatric adolescent diagnosed 1970 1986 CCSS consists 14,000 active participants including survivors leukemia brain Hodgkin 's disease non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma Wilms neuroblastoma soft-tissue sarcoma bone provided self-reported sociodemographicand health-related information survivor population increased risk broad spectrum adverse outcomes late mortality second pulmonary complications pregnancy loss giving birth offspring low birth weights decreased educational attainment ongoing evaluation large diverse cohorts survivors resources CCSS aid identifying high-risk individuals target innovative intervention strategies",0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1474, 4, 3, 24, 1, 3, 163, 1821, 107, 541, 2, 3101, 47, 627, 4, 8, 375, 207, 1, 7, 1785, 319, 337, 25, 24, 139, 130, 47, 85, 443, 6, 47, 35, 345, 23, 706, 341, 156, 2, 372, 1, 358, 242, 125, 32, 383, 74, 23, 332, 54, 32, 1134, 18, 15, 80, 1968, 1219, 24, 3, 864, 12, 2628, 45, 4657, 10, 635, 22, 8, 3069, 9, 3103, 3, 319, 337, 123, 1, 8, 180, 1, 33, 111, 332, 1, 815, 2, 3678, 12, 54, 11, 265, 59, 4868, 2, 3751, 3, 4657, 5132, 1, 80, 76, 213, 984, 544, 776, 141, 332, 1, 342, 57, 292, 34, 292, 30, 1214, 246, 2, 57, 54, 47, 1052, 1074, 210, 54856, 341, 139, 487, 3, 2628, 266, 71, 85, 204, 6, 40, 28, 101, 43, 1, 8, 2094, 1873, 1, 290, 123, 225, 22, 807, 282, 419, 163, 1087, 521, 2290, 407, 7375, 3809, 6, 8304, 5, 154, 3809, 7966, 2, 340, 3624, 7108, 3, 942, 451, 1, 375, 2, 1867, 736, 1, 12, 332, 298, 2892, 225, 22, 3, 4657, 303, 2427, 4, 195, 1386, 64, 43, 869, 54, 257, 40, 3, 283, 1, 4019, 788, 422]",1282.0,15942996,Childhood Survivor resource research long-term outcomes adult survivors childhood,1,0.007194244604316547

Loss of heterozygosity for chromosomes 1p and 16q is an adverse prognostic factor in favorable-histology Wilms tumor: a report from the National Wilms Tumor Study Group.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2005-08-29,"To determine if tumor-specific loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for chromosomes 1p or 16q is associated with a poorer prognosis for children with favorable-histology (FH) Wilms tumor entered on the fifth National Wilms Tumor Study (NWTS-5). Between August 1995 and June 2002, 2,021 previously untreated children with FH or anaplastic Wilms tumor, clear-cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK) or malignant rhabdoid tumor of the kidney (RTK), were treated with stage- and histology-specific therapy. Their tumors were assayed for LOH for polymorphic DNA markers on chromosomes 1p and 16q. ResultsLOH for 1p or 16q was rarely observed in CCSK (n = 90) or RTK (n = 22). The relative risk (RR) of relapse for patients with FH stage I to IV tumors with LOH, stratified by stage, was 1.56 for LOH 1p (P = .01) and 1.49 for LOH 16q (P = .01), whereas the RR of death was 1.84 (P = .03) and 1.44 (P = .15), respectively. When the effects of LOH for both regions were considered jointly among patients with stage I to II FH disease, the risks of relapse and death were increased for LOH 1p only (RR = 2.2, P = .02 for relapse; RR = 4.0, P = .02 for death), for LOH 16q only (RR = 1.9, P = .01 and RR = 1.4, P = .60) and for LOH for both regions (RR = 2.9, P = .001 and RR = 4.3, P = .01) in comparison with patients with LOH at neither locus.

Clin. Oncol.,2005-09-01,"Epidermal growth factor receptor is expressed in pediatric malignant solid tumors. We conducted a phase I trial of gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in children with refractory solid tumors. Gefitinib (150, 300, 400, or 500 mg/m2) was administered orally to cohorts of three to six patients once daily continuously until disease progression or significant toxicity. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed during course one (day 1 through 28). Of the 25 enrolled patients, 19 (median age, 15 years) were fully evaluable for toxicity and received 54 courses. Dose-limiting toxicity was rash in two patients treated with 500 mg/m2 and elevated ALT and AST in one patient treated with 400 mg/m2. The maximum-tolerated dose was 400 mg/m2/d. The most frequent non-dose-limiting toxicities were grade 1 or 2 dry skin, anemia, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. One patient with Ewing's sarcoma had a partial response. Disease stabilized for 8 to > or = 60 weeks in two patients with Wilms' tumor and two with brainstem glioma (one exophytic). At 400 mg/m2, the median peak gefitinib plasma concentration was 2.2 microg/mL (range, 1.2 to 3.6 microg/mL) and occurred at a median of 2.3 hours (range, 2.0 to 8.3 hours) after drug administration. The median apparent clearance and median half-life were 14.8 L/h/m2 (range, 3.8 to 24.8 L/h/m2) and 11.7 hours (range, 5.6 to 22.8 hours), respectively.

High telomerase RNA expression level is an adverse prognostic factor for favorable-histology Wilms' tumor.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2005-09-19,"A primary objective of the fifth National Wilms Tumor Study (NWTS-5) was to identify prognostic indicators for patients with favorable-histology Wilms' tumor. The prognostic significance of telomerase expression level in primary tumor samples was assessed. A case-cohort study was conducted involving 291 NWTS-5 registrants. Telomerase activity was measured using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP). Expression levels of TERT mRNA (encoding the telomerase catalytic component) and TERC/hTR (the telomerase RNA template) were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. After excluding samples because of lack of viable tumor, RNA degradation, or insufficient clinical information, 244 patients remained for the final analysis (96 with relapse and 148 without relapse). Univariate analysis revealed a positive correlation between relative risk (RR) of relapse and levels of TERT mRNA and TERC expression. For each doubling in TERT mRNA and TERC level, the RR increased by a factor of 1.16 (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.29; P = .01) and 1.35 (95% CI, 1.11 to 1.64; P = .003), respectively. The one third of patients whose tumors had the highest TERC expression level had an RR of 2.06 (95% CI, 1.14 to 3.70; P = .02) compared with patients with the lowest level. TERC expression level remained a significant prognostic indicator in a multivariate analysis adjusting for TERT mRNA, tumor stage, and patient age. TRAP level did not correlate with RR of relapse. Telomerase expression levels were not predictive of overall survival.

End stage renal disease in patients with Wilms tumor: results from the National Wilms Tumor Study Group and the United States Renal Data System.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2005-11-01,"We sought to assess accurately the full spectrum of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in Wilms tumor survivors by combining the unique resources of the National Wilms Tumor Study Group (NWTSG) and the United States Renal Data System (USRDS), and to confirm preliminary reports of an increased incidence of ESRD in patients with the Wilms tumor-aniridia syndrome (WAGR). ESRD was ascertained in 5,910 patients enrolled in NWTSG studies during 1969 to 1994 by record linkage to USRDS and by direct followup. Cumulative ESRD incidence was estimated accounting for intercurrent mortality. Of 115 cases of ESRD 10 (9%) were ascertained by the NWTSG alone, 13 (11%) by USRDS alone and 92 (80%) by both. Cumulative incidence of ESRD at 20 years from diagnosis of unilateral Wilms tumor was 74% for 17 patients with the Denys-Drash syndrome, 36% for 37 patients with WAGR, 7% for 125 male patients with hypospadias or cryptorchidism (genitourinary [GU] anomalies) and 0.6% for 5,347 patients with none of these conditions. The incidence of ESRD after diagnosis of bilateral Wilms tumor was 50% for the Denys-Drash syndrome (6 patients), 90% for WAGR (10), 25% for GU anomaly (25) and 12% for other (409). ESRD in patients with WAGR or GU anomalies tended to occur relatively late, often during or after adolescence. The risk of ESRD is remarkably low for the majority of patients with Wilms tumor.

Rhabdoid tumor of the kidney in the National Wilms' Tumor Study: age at diagnosis as a prognostic factor.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2005-10-01,"The objective of this study is to determine prognostic factors in rhabdoid tumor of the kidney (RTK), including both demographic and treatment variables. A total of 142 patients studied on National Wilms' Tumor Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were analyzed. Patients were enrolled between the years 1969 and 2002. Variables examined included sex, age of diagnosis, tumor stage, presence of CNS lesions, as well as treatment variables, including the use of doxorubicin and/or radiotherapy (RT). No survival differences were observed between males and females, between those treated with or without doxorubicin, or with or without RT. Patients with tumors of lower stage had an overall survival rate of 41.8%, whereas, tumors of higher stage were associated with a 15.9% survival (P < .001). A highly significant difference in survival was noted when patients were stratified according to age of diagnosis. Survival at 4 years in infants under 6 months of age at diagnosis was 8.8%, whereas, survival in patients 2 years of age or older was 41.1% (P < .0001). Stratification into intermediate age brackets demonstrated a strong correlation of increasing survival with increasing age at diagnosis. All patients with a CNS lesion, except one, died. Age at diagnosis is a highly significant prognostic factor for survival of children with RTK. Infants have a dismal prognosis, whereas, older children have a more favorable outcome.

Long-term outcomes of adult survivors of childhood cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2005-12-01,"During the past 30 years, changes in the treatment of children and adolescents with cancer have led to substantial improvements in survival. Although treatment-related factors have been shown to impact subsequent health status and quality of life, there is limited information on survivors who are now two or more decades after treatment. The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) was established as a resource for investigating the long-term outcomes of a cohort of 5-year survivors of childhood and adolescent cancer, diagnosed between 1970-1986. The CCSS cohort has more than 14,000 active participants, including survivors of leukemia, brain tumors, Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Wilms tumor, neuroblastoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, and bone tumors. Study participants, extensively characterized by their cancer therapy, have provided self-reported sociodemographic- and health-related information. Although the survivor population has been found to be at significantly increased risk of several adverse outcomes, such as late mortality, second cancers, pulmonary complications, pregnancy loss, low birth weight of offspring, and decreased education, the overall proportion of survivors affected is relatively small. Subgroups at high risk of adverse outcomes, defined by treatment-related, demographic, or medical factors, can be identified. The ongoing evaluation of large and diverse cohorts of cancer survivors will aid in further identifying individuals who should be the target of innovative intervention strategies.",Journal Article,5164.0,147.0,"past 30 years changes treatment children adolescents led substantial improvements survival treatment-related factors shown impact subsequent health status quality life limited information survivors decades treatment Childhood Survivor CCSS established resource investigating long-term outcomes cohort 5-year survivors childhood adolescent diagnosed 1970-1986 CCSS cohort 14,000 active participants including survivors leukemia brain Hodgkin disease non-Hodgkin lymphoma Wilms neuroblastoma soft-tissue sarcoma bone participants extensively characterized therapy provided self-reported sociodemographic- health-related information survivor population significantly increased risk adverse outcomes late mortality second pulmonary complications pregnancy loss low birth weight offspring decreased education overall proportion survivors affected relatively small Subgroups high risk adverse outcomes defined treatment-related demographic medical factors identified ongoing evaluation large diverse cohorts survivors aid identifying individuals target innovative intervention strategies",0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[190, 3, 1219, 201, 60, 400, 4, 3, 24, 1, 541, 2, 3101, 5, 12, 47, 836, 6, 1281, 1474, 4, 25, 242, 24, 139, 130, 47, 85, 443, 6, 345, 706, 341, 156, 2, 372, 1, 358, 125, 16, 383, 487, 23, 332, 54, 32, 1134, 100, 15, 80, 1968, 50, 24, 3, 864, 12, 2628, 45, 4657, 10, 635, 22, 8, 3069, 9, 3103, 3, 319, 337, 123, 1, 8, 180, 1, 33, 111, 332, 1, 864, 2, 3678, 12, 265, 59, 4868, 3751, 3, 4657, 180, 71, 80, 76, 213, 984, 544, 776, 141, 332, 1, 342, 57, 34, 30, 1214, 246, 2, 57, 45, 776, 3576, 765, 20, 136, 12, 36, 47, 1052, 1074, 210, 4221, 2, 341, 139, 487, 242, 3, 2628, 266, 71, 85, 204, 6, 40, 28, 97, 101, 43, 1, 392, 290, 123, 225, 22, 807, 282, 419, 163, 1087, 521, 2290, 407, 154, 3809, 924, 1, 8304, 2, 340, 1848, 3, 63, 920, 1, 332, 1424, 16, 1352, 302, 1453, 28, 64, 43, 1, 290, 123, 395, 20, 24, 139, 1540, 15, 484, 130, 122, 40, 108, 3, 942, 451, 1, 375, 2, 1867, 736, 1, 12, 332, 303, 2427, 4, 195, 1386, 869, 54, 257, 40, 3, 283, 1, 4019, 788, 422]",1427.0,16247780,Long-term outcomes adult survivors childhood,0,0.0
Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney: up-regulation of neural markers with activation of the sonic hedgehog and Akt pathways.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2005-11-01,"Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK), the second most common renal tumor in children, poses significant diagnostic challenges. No positive diagnostic markers are available, and the pathogenesis of CCSK remains an enigma. To address these challenges, the gene expression patterns of 14 CCSKs were compared with 15 Wilms tumors and 3 fetal kidney samples using oligonucleotide arrays. Using unsupervised methods, the gene expression profile of CCSK was distinctive: differentially expressed genes could largely be grouped into four categories: (a) a wide variety of neural markers, (b) members of the Sonic hedgehog pathway, (c) members of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt cell proliferation pathway, and (d) known therapeutic targets. Corresponding changes in critical proteins using Western blot and/or immunohistochemistry confirmed the up-regulation of these pathways and proteins. In particular, CD117 and epidermal growth factor receptor are up-regulated at the protein level in many CCSKs, providing potential therapeutic targets. One of the neural markers, nerve growth factor receptor, represents a promising diagnostic tool for CCSK. This study suggests that CCSKs arise within a renal mesenchymal cell that shows a wide variety of neural markers. As such, it seems to be susceptible to genetic changes also seen in a variety of other neuroectodermal and neuronal tumors, including activation of Sonic hedgehog and phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt pathways.

"Evaluation of the antitumor efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the histone deacetylase inhibitor depsipeptide in childhood cancer models in vivo.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2006-01-01,"Histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDAC) control the acetylation state of histones and other proteins regulating transcription and protein function. Several structurally diverse HDAC inhibitors have been developed as cancer therapeutic agents and in vitro have been shown to cause differentiation, cell cycle arrest, or apoptosis. Here, we have evaluated depsipeptide, a natural tetrapeptide HDAC inhibitor, against a panel of pediatric solid tumor models in vivo and evaluated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variables with tumor sensitivity. Depsipeptide was administered at the maximum tolerated dose (4.4 mg/kg administered every 7 days x 3 i.v. repeated q21d for a total of two cycles) to scid mice bearing 39 independently derived childhood tumors (9 brain tumors, 11 kidney cancers, 9 rhabdomyosarcomas, 3 neuroblastomas, and 7 osteosarcomas). Pharmacokinetic variables were determined, as were changes in histone and p53 acetylation, induction of p53 and p53 genotype, and alterations in Akt phosphorylation. Of 39 tumors evaluated, three showed objective tumor regressions [two brain tumors (primitive neuroectodermal tumor and atypical teratoid malignant rhabdoid tumor) and one Wilms' tumor]. Depsipeptide inhibited growth of many tumor lines but achieved stable disease (<25% increase in volume during treatment cycle 1) in only two tumor models (anaplastic astrocytoma, two rhabdomyosarcomas, and a Wilms' tumor). Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the population estimated AUC(0-24) was 1,123 ng h/mL, similar to the exposure following 13 mg/m2 in ongoing phase I trials. Pharmacodynamic changes in histone acetylation (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) in three depsipeptide-sensitive and three intrinsically resistant tumors followed a similar pattern; maximal increases in histone acetylation occurred at 8 hours and were elevated for up to 96 hours. In two sensitive tumor lines, IRS56 and BT27 (both wild-type p53) p53 increased in treated tumors being maximal at 8 hours and associated with induction of p21(cip1), whereas p53 was stable in tumors with mutant p53. Sensitivity to depsipeptide did not correlate with p53 genotype, p53 acetylation, cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, or phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473). Our results show that depsipeptide inhibits its target in vivo causing increased histone acetylation; however, this does not correlate with drug sensitivity. The relatively low objective response rate [3 of 39 (8%) tumor lines showing greater than or equal to partial response and 4 (10%) stable disease] administered at dose levels that give clinically relevant drug exposures suggests that as a single agent depsipeptide may have limited clinical utility against pediatric solid tumors in a first-line setting.",Journal Article,5133.0,75.0,"Histone acetyltransferases histone deacetylases HDAC control acetylation state histones regulating transcription function structurally diverse HDAC inhibitors developed therapeutic agents vitro shown cause differentiation cycle arrest apoptosis evaluated depsipeptide natural tetrapeptide HDAC inhibitor panel pediatric solid models vivo evaluated pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic variables sensitivity Depsipeptide administered maximum tolerated dose 4.4 mg/kg administered 7 days x 3 i.v repeated q21d total cycles scid mice bearing 39 independently derived childhood 9 brain 11 kidney 9 rhabdomyosarcomas 3 neuroblastomas 7 osteosarcomas Pharmacokinetic variables determined changes histone p53 acetylation induction p53 p53 genotype alterations Akt phosphorylation 39 evaluated showed objective regressions brain primitive neuroectodermal atypical teratoid malignant rhabdoid Wilms Depsipeptide inhibited growth lines achieved stable disease 25 increase volume treatment cycle 1 models anaplastic astrocytoma rhabdomyosarcomas Wilms Pharmacokinetic showed population estimated AUC 0-24 1,123 ng h/mL similar exposure following 13 mg/m2 ongoing phase trials Pharmacodynamic changes histone acetylation H2A H2B H3 H4 depsipeptide-sensitive intrinsically resistant followed similar pattern maximal increases histone acetylation occurred 8 hours elevated 96 hours sensitive lines IRS56 BT27 wild-type p53 p53 increased treated maximal 8 hours associated induction p21 cip1 p53 stable p53 Sensitivity depsipeptide correlate p53 genotype p53 acetylation cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase phosphorylation Akt Ser473 depsipeptide inhibits target vivo causing increased histone acetylation correlate drug sensitivity relatively low objective response rate 3 39 8 lines showing greater equal partial response 4 10 stable disease administered dose levels clinically relevant drug exposures suggests single agent depsipeptide limited clinical utility pediatric solid first-line setting",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1508, 18849, 2, 1508, 9758, 2654, 182, 3, 4145, 1309, 1, 8457, 2, 127, 652, 2681, 866, 2, 178, 343, 392, 8533, 1867, 2654, 222, 47, 85, 276, 22, 12, 189, 183, 2, 4, 439, 47, 85, 443, 6, 708, 910, 31, 417, 1854, 15, 351, 467, 21, 47, 194, 10072, 8, 1504, 38094, 2654, 230, 480, 8, 993, 1, 815, 537, 30, 274, 4, 386, 2, 194, 1456, 2, 2424, 682, 5, 30, 485, 10072, 10, 468, 28, 3, 689, 421, 61, 39, 39, 81, 503, 468, 454, 67, 162, 1006, 27, 70, 603, 2113, 22333, 9, 8, 181, 1, 100, 410, 6, 4129, 399, 1894, 587, 1042, 526, 864, 57, 83, 342, 57, 175, 163, 83, 15480, 27, 8915, 2, 67, 11089, 1456, 682, 11, 509, 22, 11, 400, 4, 1508, 2, 624, 4145, 504, 1, 624, 2, 624, 1183, 2, 593, 4, 649, 982, 1, 587, 57, 194, 169, 224, 461, 30, 5142, 100, 342, 57, 5594, 7160, 30, 2, 1973, 12478, 393, 30, 2, 104, 30, 10072, 879, 129, 1, 445, 30, 285, 84, 513, 585, 34, 243, 344, 4, 433, 190, 24, 417, 14, 4, 158, 100, 30, 274, 1841, 3822, 100, 15480, 2, 8, 30, 1456, 65, 224, 17, 3, 266, 661, 1376, 13, 259, 10, 14, 2698, 997, 555, 542, 288, 6, 3, 645, 366, 233, 81, 821, 4, 942, 124, 70, 143, 2424, 400, 4, 1508, 4145, 19741, 26465, 3739, 2, 7812, 4, 169, 10072, 745, 2, 169, 9759, 436, 57, 370, 8, 288, 1177, 2725, 1106, 4, 1508, 4145, 489, 28, 66, 1459, 2, 11, 804, 9, 126, 6, 921, 1459, 4, 100, 745, 30, 285, 55233, 2, 55234, 110, 955, 267, 624, 624, 101, 4, 73, 57, 486, 2725, 28, 66, 1459, 2, 41, 5, 504, 1, 2657, 6927, 547, 624, 10, 585, 4, 57, 5, 620, 624, 485, 6, 10072, 205, 44, 1513, 5, 624, 1183, 624, 4145, 5885, 2699, 3638, 3507, 1451, 15, 982, 1, 649, 11842, 114, 99, 514, 17, 10072, 1576, 211, 283, 4, 386, 3440, 101, 1508, 4145, 137, 26, 1097, 44, 1513, 5, 234, 485, 3, 1352, 154, 461, 51, 116, 27, 1, 587, 66, 30, 285, 2069, 378, 76, 15, 2997, 6, 450, 51, 2, 39, 79, 585, 34, 468, 28, 61, 148, 17, 4978, 505, 867, 234, 3401, 844, 17, 22, 8, 226, 420, 10072, 68, 47, 383, 38, 1207, 480, 815, 537, 57, 4, 8, 157, 328, 546]",2660.0,16397046,Evaluation antitumor efficacy pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics histone deacetylase inhibitor depsipeptide childhood models vivo,0,0.0
Radiation therapy for favorable histology Wilms tumor: prevention of flank recurrence did not improve survival on National Wilms Tumor Studies 3 and 4.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2006-03-20,"To determine whether radiation therapy (RT) of patients with Wilms tumor of favorable histology prevented flank recurrence and thereby improved the survival outcomes. Recurrence and mortality risks were compared among groups of patients with Stage I-IV/favorable histology Wilms tumor enrolled in the third (n = 1,640) and fourth (n = 2,066) National Wilms Tumor Study Group studies. Proportions of patients with flank recurrence were 0 of 513 = 0.0% for 20 Gy, 12 of 805 = 1.5% for 10 Gy, and 44 of 2,388 = 1.8% for no flank RT (p trend = 0.001 adjusted for stage and doxorubicin); for intra-abdominal (including flank) recurrence they were 5 of 513 = 1.0%, 30 of 805 = 3.7%, and 58 of 2,388 = 2.4%, respectively (p trend = 0.02 adjusted). Survival percentages at 8 years after intra-abdominal recurrence were 0 of 5 = 0% for 20 Gy, 10 of 30 = 33% for 10 Gy, and 34 of 58 = 56% for no RT (p trend = 0.0001). NWTS-4 discontinued use of 20 Gy RT, and the 8-year flank recurrence risk increased to 2.1% from 1.0% on NWTS-3 (p = 0.013). However, event-free survival was unaltered (88% vs. 86%, p = 0.39), and overall survival was better (93.8% vs. 90.8%, p = 0.036) on NWTS-4. Partly because of lower postrecurrence mortality among nonirradiated patients, prevention of flank recurrence by RT did not improve survival.

Treatment of Wilms tumor relapsing after initial treatment with vincristine and actinomycin D: a report from the National Wilms Tumor Study Group.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2007-05-01,"NWTS-5 was a multi-institutional clinical trial for patients less than 16 years of age at diagnosis with specific renal neoplasms who were diagnosed between August 1, 1995 and May 31, 2002. A uniform approach to the treatment of patients with relapse was employed. Seventy-two patients who relapsed after immediate nephrectomy (stages I and II), initial chemotherapy with vincristine (VCR) and actinomycin D and no radiation therapy were registered on stratum B of the NWTS-5 relapse protocol. Four patients were not evaluable: one due to insufficient data and three due to major protocol violations. Among the 68 remaining patients, one who was 19 years of age at initial diagnosis of Wilms tumor, five with bilateral Wilms tumor at diagnosis, three who developed a contralateral relapse, and one with persistent disease were not included in this analysis. Relapse treatment included surgical excision, when feasible, radiation therapy and alternating courses of VCR, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide and etoposide and cyclophosphamide. The outcomes of 58 patients were analyzed. The lung was the only site of relapse for 31 patients. Event-free survival 4 years after relapse was 71.1% and 4-year overall survival was 81.8% for all patients and were 67.8 and 81.0% for those who relapsed only to their lungs. The most frequent toxicities were hematological.

Bilateral Wilms' tumors with progressive or nonresponsive disease.,Journal of pediatric surgery,J. Pediatr. Surg.,2006-04-01,"To provide guidelines for future cooperative group trials, we reviewed the outcomes of children with bilateral Wilms' tumors (BWTs) treated on National Wilms Tumor Study-4 (NWTS-4) who had progressive or nonresponsive disease (PNRD). NWTS-4 enrolled 3335 patients from August 1986 to September 1994 including 188 patients with BWT (5.6%). Treatment and outcome data were collected on patients with BWT. Treatment guidelines were outlined in the protocol, but patients were not on study. Thirty-eight children with BWT had PNRD. Preoperative chemotherapy was given for a median of 7 months (range, 2-29 months) before definitive resection. After the initial chemotherapy regimen, 36 children went on to a second regimen, and of these, 21 children received a third regimen before resection. Eleven patients received irradiation to one or both kidneys. Pathology at resection revealed previously undiagnosed anaplasia in 3 patients (2 diffuse and 1 focal) treated for 14, 15, and 15 months before resection. A fourth patient developed a diffusely anaplastic tumor 13 months after therapy. Other pathological findings included rhabdomyomatous (4 patients) or differentiated stromal elements (10 patients) and complete necrosis (1 patient).

Translocation RCC, bearing TFE3 or TFEB gene fusions, are recently recognized entities for which risk factors have not been identified. We describe the clinical, pathologic, cytogenetic, and molecular data on six translocation RCCs that arose in five young patients who had received chemotherapy. The ages at time of diagnosis of the RCC ranged from 6 to 22 years. Histologically, these tumors showed typical features previously described for translocation RCCs. At the molecular level, three tumors contained the ASPL-TFE3 fusion, two contained Alpha-TFEB, and one contained PRCC-TFE3. The intervals between chemotherapy and the diagnosis of RCC ranged from 4 to 13 years. The indications for the antecedent chemotherapy were varied and included acute promyelocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia with t(9;11), bilateral Wilms' tumor, systemic lupus erythematosus, and conditioning regimen of bone marrow transplant for Hurler's syndrome. Only the latter patient had also received radiation. Hence, among 39 genetically confirmed translocation RCCs in our personal experience, six (15%) have arisen in patients who had received cytotoxic chemotherapy.

Prospective single-arm studies were conducted. Patients with stage I AH were treated with vincristine and dactinomycin for 18 weeks. Patients with stages II to IV diffuse AH were treated with vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide for 24 weeks plus flank/abdominal radiation. A total of 2,596 patients with Wilms' tumor were enrolled onto NWTS-5, of whom 281 (10.8%) had AH. Four-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) estimates for assessable patients with stage I AH (n = 29) were 69.5% (95% CI, 46.9 to 84.0) and 82.6% (95% CI, 63.1 to 92.4).

Evaluation of gefitinib for treatment of refractory solid tumors and central nervous system malignancies in pediatric patients.,Cancer investigation,Cancer Invest.,,"Gefitinib (ZD1839, Iressa), a member of the 4-anilinoquinazoline class of compounds, has the chemical name 4-quinazolinamine, N-(3-chloro-4-flurophenyl)-7-methoxy-6-[3-(4-morpholinyl)propoxy]. Gefitinib often is referred to as a ""specific"" or ""selective"" inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR expression has been noted in neuroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines and in tumor specimens from children with Wilms tumor, osteosarcoma, and glioma. Thus, gefitinib, the first marketed EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was chosen for study in children with refractory solid tumors and central nervous system (CNS) malignancies. This review discusses findings from 3 clinical trials of gefitinib in children with refractory solid tumors and CNS malignancies, focusing on the clinical pharmacology of the compound. To date, gefitinib has been studied in children as a single agent and in combination with irinotecan. Overall, the compound has been well tolerated in children and has a safety profile similar to that observed in adults. The clinical pharmacokinetics of gefitinib in children are similar to those observed in adults.

Health-related quality of life in adult survivors of childhood Wilms tumor or neuroblastoma: A report from the childhood cancer survivor study.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2007-10-01,"Long-term survivors of Wilms tumor and neuroblastoma may experience significant late adverse effects from their disease and its therapy. Little is known, however, about the health-related quality of life experienced by these survivors. Health-related quality of life, measured by the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), was assessed from self-report in adult survivors of Wilms tumor (N = 654) and neuroblastoma (N = 432) who participated in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. More than 90% of the study population was 18-34 years old at interview, and 58% were females. There was no significant difference on any SF-36 subscale or summary scale between the two diagnostic groups. On average, survivors reported no decrement on the Physical Component Summary scale of the SF-36 when compared to population norms. However, both groups scored significantly below the population mean score (50) on the Mental Component Summary Scale of the SF-36 (Wilms tumor mean = 41.66, standard error = 2.19, P < 0.0001; neuroblastoma mean = 42.41, standard error = 2.23, P < 0.0001) reflecting decreased emotional health. Independent risk factors for lower scores on this scale included female gender, Native American race, unemployment, and household income below $20,000.

A phase 2 trial of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), administered orally at a dose of 90 mg/m(2)/day in three divided doses for 3 consecutive days per week, and IFN-alpha2a, administered subcutaneously daily at a dose of 3 x 10(6) U/m(2)/day for 5 consecutive days per week, in 4 week cycles was performed. A two-stage design was used for each disease stratum. Seventeen patients (16 evaluable) with neuroblastoma, median age 9 years, and 15 patients (14 evaluable) with Wilms tumor, median age 6 years, were enrolled. Overall, the combination was well tolerated, with headache being the most common toxicity observed. There were no complete or partial responses. The median number of cycles administered was 1 (range 1-9). Four patients with neuroblastoma had stable disease for 12 or more weeks. The combination of ATRA and IFN-alpha2a was inactive in children with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma and Wilms tumor. The lack of activity with this combination in children with refractory neuroblastoma is similar to the disappointing phase 2 results of single agent 13-cis-retinoic-acid (13cRA) and does not support further development of ATRA for children with relapsed neuroblastoma.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",4495.0,31.0,combination antiproliferative differentiation-inducing effects retinoids antiproliferative immunostimulatory differentiation-potentiating effects interferon-alpha IFN-alpha basis development combination pediatric patients refractory neuroblastoma Wilms phase 2 trial all-trans-retinoic acid ATRA administered orally dose 90 mg/m 2 /day divided doses 3 consecutive days week IFN-alpha2a administered subcutaneously daily dose 3 x 10 6 U/m 2 /day 5 consecutive days week 4 week cycles performed two-stage design disease stratum Seventeen patients 16 evaluable neuroblastoma median age 9 years 15 patients 14 evaluable Wilms median age 6 years enrolled Overall combination tolerated headache common toxicity observed complete partial responses median number cycles administered 1 range 1-9 patients neuroblastoma stable disease 12 weeks combination ATRA IFN-alpha2a inactive children relapsed refractory neuroblastoma Wilms lack activity combination children refractory neuroblastoma similar disappointing phase 2 single agent 13-cis-retinoic-acid 13cRA support development ATRA children relapsed neuroblastoma,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 150, 1, 3, 3669, 2, 910, 1958, 176, 1, 7358, 1162, 5, 3, 3669, 9374, 2, 910, 13001, 176, 1, 1688, 950, 1256, 950, 11, 3, 877, 9, 3, 193, 1, 26, 150, 4, 815, 7, 5, 430, 15, 30, 8, 124, 18, 160, 1, 62, 3437, 3887, 971, 2822, 468, 1428, 28, 8, 61, 1, 424, 81, 188, 18, 218, 4, 169, 2176, 415, 9, 27, 935, 162, 379, 647, 2, 1256, 33579, 468, 3928, 391, 28, 8, 61, 1, 27, 1006, 79, 49, 1767, 188, 18, 218, 9, 33, 935, 162, 379, 647, 4, 39, 647, 410, 10, 173, 8, 100, 82, 771, 10, 95, 9, 296, 34, 4897, 3591, 7, 245, 859, 5, 52, 89, 83, 60, 2, 167, 7, 213, 859, 5, 30, 52, 89, 49, 60, 11, 346, 63, 3, 150, 10, 149, 421, 5, 4538, 486, 3, 96, 186, 155, 164, 125, 11, 77, 236, 15, 450, 253, 3, 52, 207, 1, 410, 468, 10, 14, 184, 14, 83, 294, 7, 5, 42, 585, 34, 9, 133, 15, 80, 244, 3, 150, 1, 2822, 2, 1256, 33579, 10, 5002, 4, 541, 5, 591, 15, 430, 2, 30, 3, 926, 1, 128, 5, 26, 150, 4, 541, 5, 430, 16, 288, 6, 3, 5964, 124, 18, 99, 1, 226, 420, 233, 1927, 3887, 971, 20156, 2, 1097, 44, 538, 195, 193, 1, 2822, 9, 541, 5, 591]",1394.0,16900483,phase 2 trial all-trans-retinoic acid combination interferon-alpha2a children recurrent neuroblastoma Wilms Pediatric Oncology Branch NCI Children 's Oncology Group,2,0.014388489208633094
Bilateral Wilms' tumor with anaplasia: lessons from the National Wilms' Tumor Study.,Journal of pediatric surgery,J. Pediatr. Surg.,2006-10-01,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether initial diagnostic technique influenced the ability to identify anaplastic histology, to determine the time interval to diagnosis of anaplasia, and to delineate the incidence of discordant pathology in bilateral Wilms' tumor. We hypothesized that delay in diagnosis of anaplasia could affect time to appropriate surgery and intensive multimodality therapy. One hundred eight-nine children were enrolled in the fourth National Wilms' Tumor Study with synchronous bilateral tumors, 27 of whom were eventually shown to have anaplastic histology. Initial diagnostic technique, time interval to diagnosis of anaplasia, and the incidence of discordant pathology were determined. Anaplasia was identified in 0 of 7 tumors by core needle biopsy, 3 of 9 tumors by open wedge biopsy, and in 7 of 9 cases by partial or complete nephrectomy. The mean duration of first chemotherapy regimen (DD or EE) was 20, 39, and 36 weeks, respectively, before anaplasia was identified at second surgery. Discordant pathology between bilateral tumors was identified on final tissue diagnosis in 20 patients. Only 4 patients had anaplastic tumors in both kidneys. Core needle biopsy did not identify anaplasia in 7 of 7 children. Open biopsy or partial/complete nephrectomy identified anaplasia at initial diagnostic procedure in 10 of 18 children. Twenty of 24 patients at final tissue diagnosis had discordant pathology between the 2 kidneys.

Programmed cell death-4 tumor suppressor protein contributes to retinoic acid-induced terminal granulocytic differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells.,Molecular cancer research : MCR,Mol. Cancer Res.,2007-01-01,"Programmed cell death-4 (PDCD4) is a recently discovered tumor suppressor protein that inhibits protein synthesis by suppression of translation initiation. We investigated the role and the regulation of PDCD4 in the terminal differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Expression of PDCD4 was markedly up-regulated during all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced granulocytic differentiation in NB4 and HL60 AML cell lines and in primary human promyelocytic leukemia (AML-M3) and CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells but not in differentiation-resistant NB4.R1 and HL60R cells. Induction of PDCD4 expression was associated with nuclear translocation of PDCD4 in NB4 cells undergoing granulocytic differentiation but not in NB4.R1 cells. Other granulocytic differentiation inducers such as DMSO and arsenic trioxide also induced PDCD4 expression in NB4 cells. In contrast, PDCD4 was not up-regulated during monocytic/macrophagic differentiation induced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate in NB4 cells or by ATRA in THP1 myelomonoblastic cells. Knockdown of PDCD4 by RNA interference (siRNA) inhibited ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation and reduced expression of key proteins known to be regulated by ATRA, including p27(Kip1) and DAP5/p97, and induced c-myc and Wilms' tumor 1, but did not alter expression of c-jun, p21(Waf1/Cip1), and tissue transglutaminase (TG2). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway was found to regulate PDCD4 expression because inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 and wortmannin or of mTOR by rapamycin induced PDCD4 protein and mRNA expression. In conclusion, our data suggest that PDCD4 expression contributes to ATRA-induced granulocytic but not monocytic/macrophagic differentiation.

Hepatic metastasectomy in children.,Cancer,Cancer,2007-05-01,"There are little data regarding the safety and efficacy of hepatic metastasectomy for solid tumors in childhood. We reviewed our institutional experience to assess operative mortality and morbidity, technique of resection, local control, and survival in pediatric patients undergoing liver resection for metastases. All pediatric patients who underwent hepatic resection for metastatic disease from August 1988 to July 2005 were retrospectively identified and clinical data were collected. Fifteen patients were identified during this period and primary malignancies included neuroblastoma (7), Wilms tumor (3), osteogenic sarcoma (2), malignant gastric epithelial tumor (1), and desmoplastic small round cell tumor (2). Twelve patients underwent anatomical hepatic resections and 3 had wedge resections. There were no intraoperative or postoperative deaths. The 2 postoperative complications included 1 wound infection and 1 bile collection. The median follow-up after hepatic resection was 1.6 years (0.2-7 years). Three patients remain alive. Eleven patients died of progressive disease; 4 patients suffered local recurrence. One patient died from enterocolitis and sepsis and was without evidence of malignancy at the time of death.

Renal failure does not preclude cure in children receiving chemotherapy for Wilms tumor: a report from the National Wilms Tumor Study Group.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2008-02-01,"Children with Wilms tumor can develop renal failure during treatment. Since there are few published data concerning the appropriate chemotherapy for this situation, we reviewed the experience of children who developed renal failure while being treated on National Wilms Tumor Study Group (NWTSG) studies 1-4 (1969-1994). Data files in the NWTSG Data Center for all patients with Wilms tumor were screened. Patient demographics and tumor and treatment data were abstracted from those who developed renal failure. Twenty-eight of 5,910 (0.47%) children with Wilms tumor registered on NWTSG studies I through IV (1971-1994) were treated with chemotherapy after developing renal failure. Among these patients vincristine at full dose (0.05 mg/kg dose) did not increase the risk of severe toxicity. Dactinomycin (full dose: 15 mcg/kg day x 5) increased the risk for severe neutropenia when given at 75-100% of full dose. There was no compelling evidence for increased toxicity of doxorubicin when given at 100% versus 50% dosing (full dose: 20 mg/m(2) day x 3), but the number of patients analyzed was small. The overall survival percentage was 39%, but 64% for those patients who were in their initial treatment phase at the time of renal failure. The data suggest that, in the setting of renal failure, reduction of dosing is not necessary for the three main agents used for treatment of newly diagnosed Wilms tumor, and cure is not precluded.

One hundred three patients who relapsed or had progressive disease after initial VAD chemotherapy and radiation therapy were registered on stratum C of the NWTS-5 Relapse protocol. Twelve patients were not evaluable: five due to insufficient data, six due to major protocol violations, and one for refusal of therapy. Among the 91 remaining patients, 14 with stage V Wilms tumor (WT), 1 with contralateral relapse, and 16 who did not achieve a complete response (CR) to the initial three-drug chemotherapy were not included in this analysis. Relapse treatment included alternating courses of the drug pairs cyclophosphamide/etoposide and carboplatin/etoposide, surgery, and radiation therapy. The outcomes of 60 patients were analyzed. The lung was the only site of relapse for 33 patients; other sites of relapse included the operative bed, the abdomen, and liver. Four-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 42.3 and 48.0% respectively for all patients and were 48.9 and 52.8% for those who relapsed in the lungs only.

Peptide epitopes from the Wilms' tumor 1 oncoprotein stimulate CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that recognize and kill human malignant mesothelioma tumor cells.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2007-08-01,"Wilms' tumor 1 protein (WT1), a transcription factor overexpressed in malignant mesothelioma, leukemias, and other solid tumors, is an ideal target for immunotherapy. WT1 class I peptide epitopes that were identified and shown to stimulate CD8(+) T cells are being tested as vaccine candidates in several clinical trials. The induction and maintenance of a robust memory CD8(+) cytotoxic T-cell response requires CD4(+) T-cell help. Three HLA class II peptide epitopes of WT1 with high predictive affinities to multiple HLA-DRB1 molecules were identified using the SYFPEITHI algorithm. Due to the highly polymorphic nature of the HLA class II alleles, such reactivity is critical in the development of a broadly useful therapeutic. One of the WT1 CD4(+) peptide epitopes, 122-140, comprises a previously identified CD8(+) peptide epitope (126-134). By mutating residue 126 from an arginine to a tyrosine, we embedded a synthetic immunogenic analogue CD8(+) epitope (126-134) inside the longer peptide (122-140). This analogue was previously designed to improve immunogenicity and induce a potent CD8(+) response. WT1 peptides 328-349 and 423-441 are able to stimulate a peptide-specific CD4(+) response that can recognize WT1(+) tumor cells in multiple HLA-DRB1 settings as determined by IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assays. The mutated WT1 peptide epitope 122-140 is able to induce CD4(+) and cytotoxic CD8(+) WT1-specific T-cell responses that can recognize the native WT1 epitopes on the surface of human WT1(+) cancer cells. Cross-priming experiments showed that antigen-presenting cells pulsed with either mesothelioma or leukemia tumor lysates can process and present each of the CD4(+) peptides identified.

The use of preoperative chemotherapy in Wilms' tumor with contained retroperitoneal rupture.,Journal of pediatric surgery,J. Pediatr. Surg.,2007-09-01,"The National Wilms Tumor Study currently describes 3 indications for the use of preoperative chemotherapy: extensive caval involvement, bilateral tumors, and patients who only have a single kidney. However, the management of patients who present with a contained retroperitoneal rupture is not specifically addressed. This is relevant because of the strong possibility of peritoneal contamination when performing a primary resection and the resultant requirement for total abdominal radiation. The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in this subgroup of patients may be warranted. We retrospectively reviewed our experience with Wilms' tumor and identified 3 cases with contained rupture at presentation. Details of their initial evaluation and therapy, resection and pathologic findings, and follow-up constitute this report. Institutional review board waiver was obtained for the purposes of this review. Two male patients, aged 2.9 years, and 1 female patient, aged 9.3 years, were identified. All patients received preoperative chemotherapy with vincristine and dactinomycin (n = 1) plus doxorubicin (n = 2) for 4 to 6 weeks before surgical resection. One patient underwent pretreatment computed tomography-guided biopsy of the kidney mass for diagnostic purposes. Presurgical computed tomographic scans showed resolution of perinephric blood and fluid with tumor shrinkage. Histopathologic analyses showed all tumors were resected with negative margins, and there was no intraoperative tumor spillage. All patients received 1050 to 1080 cGy of flank radiation postoperatively. All patients are currently alive at follow-up without evidence of local recurrence or distant disease. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy allowed for complete resection and avoidance of total abdominal radiation in 3 patients with ruptured Wilms' tumor and hematoma within the retroperitoneum. These data support the use of initial chemotherapy in children with retroperitoneal rupture and hematoma of Wilms' tumor at diagnosis.",Journal Article,4525.0,7.0,National Wilms currently describes 3 indications use preoperative chemotherapy extensive caval involvement bilateral patients single kidney management patients present contained retroperitoneal rupture specifically addressed relevant strong possibility peritoneal contamination performing primary resection resultant requirement total abdominal radiation use neoadjuvant chemotherapy subgroup patients warranted retrospectively reviewed experience Wilms identified 3 cases contained rupture presentation Details initial evaluation therapy resection pathologic findings follow-up constitute report Institutional review board waiver obtained purposes review male patients aged 2.9 years 1 female patient aged 9.3 years identified patients received preoperative chemotherapy vincristine dactinomycin n 1 plus doxorubicin n 2 4 6 weeks surgical resection patient underwent pretreatment computed tomography-guided biopsy kidney mass diagnostic purposes Presurgical computed tomographic scans showed resolution perinephric blood fluid shrinkage Histopathologic showed resected negative margins intraoperative spillage patients received 1050 1080 cGy flank radiation postoperatively patients currently alive follow-up evidence local recurrence distant disease Neoadjuvant chemotherapy allowed complete resection avoidance total abdominal radiation 3 patients ruptured Wilms hematoma retroperitoneum support use initial chemotherapy children retroperitoneal rupture hematoma Wilms diagnosis,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 657, 30, 45, 694, 2677, 27, 2406, 9, 3, 119, 1, 498, 56, 1344, 14732, 799, 1607, 57, 2, 7, 54, 158, 47, 8, 226, 137, 3, 284, 1, 7, 54, 364, 5, 8, 3070, 2591, 10553, 16, 44, 1225, 2814, 26, 16, 867, 408, 1, 3, 1082, 2526, 1, 1639, 9866, 198, 3620, 8, 86, 170, 2, 3, 6099, 4701, 9, 181, 1467, 121, 3, 119, 1, 536, 56, 4, 26, 1363, 1, 7, 68, 40, 1197, 21, 894, 446, 114, 730, 5, 30, 2, 108, 27, 140, 5, 3070, 10553, 28, 1031, 3791, 1, 136, 388, 451, 2, 36, 170, 2, 510, 272, 2, 166, 126, 4999, 26, 414, 1115, 206, 2620, 17329, 10, 683, 9, 3, 4624, 1, 26, 206, 100, 1045, 7, 1032, 18, 83, 60, 2, 14, 1061, 69, 1032, 83, 27, 60, 11, 108, 62, 7, 103, 498, 56, 5, 2132, 2, 10295, 78, 14, 349, 856, 78, 18, 9, 39, 6, 49, 244, 348, 221, 170, 104, 69, 208, 1194, 1220, 872, 1808, 411, 1, 3, 782, 9, 752, 4624, 8851, 1220, 6158, 1441, 224, 2125, 1, 14130, 315, 2, 2357, 5, 30, 4973, 2630, 318, 224, 62, 57, 11, 1133, 5, 199, 1012, 2, 125, 10, 77, 1720, 30, 18759, 62, 7, 103, 24784, 6, 19711, 3071, 1, 5564, 121, 3541, 62, 7, 32, 694, 1701, 28, 166, 126, 187, 241, 1, 293, 146, 15, 626, 34, 536, 56, 2313, 9, 236, 170, 2, 5863, 1, 181, 1467, 121, 4, 27, 7, 5, 18937, 30, 2, 13805, 262, 3, 7765, 46, 74, 538, 3, 119, 1, 388, 56, 4, 541, 5, 2591, 10553, 2, 13805, 1, 30, 28, 147]",1920.0,17848255,use preoperative chemotherapy Wilms contained retroperitoneal rupture,0,0.0
Avoiding misdiagnosing neuroblastoma as Wilms tumor.,Journal of pediatric surgery,J. Pediatr. Surg.,2008-06-01,"Although occasionally difficult, distinguishing abdominal neuroblastoma (NBL) from Wilms tumor (WT) at presentation is important, as surgical management differs significantly. We reviewed our 20-year experience (1987-2006) treating patients with NBL, focusing on those with an initial diagnosis of WT, to determine presenting features that would have suggested the correct preoperative diagnosis. Retrospective case cohort study reviewing charts and imaging of patients with NBL initially diagnosed clinically with WT. Preoperative symptoms, laboratory studies, and imaging were evaluated. Similar variables were assessed in the 20 patients with WT most recently treated at our institution. Nine patients with NBL were identified as those who had an exploratory laparotomy with a preoperative diagnosis of WT; 8 underwent nephrectomy at exploration. Children with NBL had symptoms such as fever and weight loss at presentation (67%) more often than patients with WT (20%). Preoperative computed tomography demonstrated intratumoral calcifications, vascular encasement, or both in 78% of patients with NBL but were never seen in WT patients. Of interest, preoperative urinary catecholamines were elevated in 5 patients ultimately diagnosed with NBL. Although NBL can be mistaken for WT at presentation, the presence of constitutional symptoms, or intratumoral calcification or vascular encasement on preoperative imaging should heighten suspicion for NBL. In addition, laboratory evaluation, including urinary catecholamines, should be completed before surgery when the etiology of an abdominal tumor is uncertain.",Journal Article,4251.0,20.0,occasionally difficult distinguishing abdominal neuroblastoma NBL Wilms WT presentation important surgical management differs significantly reviewed 20-year experience 1987-2006 treating patients NBL focusing initial diagnosis WT determine presenting features suggested correct preoperative diagnosis Retrospective case cohort reviewing charts imaging patients NBL initially diagnosed clinically WT Preoperative symptoms laboratory studies imaging evaluated Similar variables assessed 20 patients WT recently treated institution patients NBL identified exploratory laparotomy preoperative diagnosis WT 8 underwent nephrectomy exploration Children NBL symptoms fever weight loss presentation 67 patients WT 20 Preoperative computed tomography demonstrated intratumoral calcifications vascular encasement 78 patients NBL seen WT patients preoperative urinary catecholamines elevated 5 patients ultimately diagnosed NBL NBL mistaken WT presentation presence constitutional symptoms intratumoral calcification vascular encasement preoperative imaging heighten suspicion NBL addition laboratory evaluation including urinary catecholamines completed surgery etiology abdominal uncertain,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[242, 6319, 1740, 4508, 1467, 12032, 29, 30, 1820, 28, 1031, 16, 305, 22, 221, 284, 4990, 97, 21, 446, 114, 179, 111, 730, 5450, 1324, 1367, 7, 5, 12032, 3312, 23, 135, 5, 35, 388, 147, 1, 1820, 6, 223, 1656, 404, 17, 688, 47, 1148, 3, 4883, 498, 147, 459, 473, 180, 45, 6979, 4413, 2, 270, 1, 7, 5, 12032, 1625, 265, 505, 5, 1820, 498, 507, 1624, 94, 2, 270, 11, 194, 288, 682, 11, 275, 4, 3, 179, 7, 5, 1820, 96, 761, 73, 28, 114, 731, 762, 7, 5, 12032, 11, 108, 22, 135, 54, 42, 35, 2386, 3274, 5, 8, 498, 147, 1, 1820, 66, 208, 1738, 28, 3370, 541, 5, 12032, 42, 507, 225, 22, 2775, 2, 924, 407, 28, 1031, 598, 80, 629, 76, 7, 5, 1820, 179, 498, 1220, 872, 264, 2074, 6740, 756, 14229, 15, 110, 4, 833, 1, 7, 5, 12032, 84, 11, 1737, 527, 4, 1820, 7, 1, 1333, 498, 1660, 17097, 11, 804, 4, 33, 7, 2050, 265, 5, 12032, 242, 12032, 122, 40, 16214, 9, 1820, 28, 1031, 3, 463, 1, 5962, 507, 15, 2074, 14523, 15, 756, 14229, 23, 498, 270, 257, 20230, 5782, 9, 12032, 4, 352, 1624, 451, 141, 1660, 17097, 257, 40, 781, 348, 152, 198, 3, 2855, 1, 35, 1467, 30, 16, 2717]",1554.0,18558200,Avoiding misdiagnosing neuroblastoma Wilms,4,0.02877697841726619
Wilms' tumor 1 gene mutations independently predict poor outcome in adults with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia: a cancer and leukemia group B study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2008-06-16,"To analyze the prognostic impact of Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) gene mutations in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). PATIENTS AND METHODS We studied 196 adults younger than 60 years with newly diagnosed primary CN-AML, who were treated similarly on Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) protocols 9621 and 19808, for WT1 mutations in exons 7 and 9. The patients also were assessed for the presence of FLT3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD), FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain mutations (FLT3-TKD), MLL partial tandem duplications (MLL-PTD), NPM1 and CEBPA mutations, and for the expression levels of ERG and BAALC. Twenty-one patients (10.7%) harbored WT1 mutations. Complete remission rates were not significantly different between patients with WT1 mutations and those with unmutated WT1 (P = .36; 76% v 84%). Patients with WT1 mutations had worse disease-free survival (DFS; P < .001; 3-year rates, 13% v 50%) and overall survival (OS; P < .001; 3-year rates, 10% v 56%) than patients with unmutated WT1. In multivariable analyses, WT1 mutations independently predicted worse DFS (P = .009; hazard ratio [HR] = 2.7) when controlling for CEBPA mutational status, ERG expression level, and FLT3-ITD/NPM1 molecular-risk group (ie, FLT3-ITD(negative)/NPM1(mutated) as low risk v FLT3-ITD(positive) and/or NPM1(wild-type) as high risk).

Peptide vaccines for myeloid leukaemias.,Best practice & research. Clinical haematology,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,2008-09-01,"The development of cancer vaccines directed against myeloid leukaemias has been a research area of intense interest in the past decade. Both human studies in vitro and mouse models in vivo have demonstrated that leukaemia-associated antigens (LAAs), such as the fusion protein BCR-ABL, Wilms' tumour protein and proteinase 3, may serve as effective targets for cellular immunotherapy. Peptide-based vaccines are able to induce cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses that kill leukaemia cells. Based on these results, pilot clinical trials have been initiated in chronic and acute myeloid leukaemia and other haematological malignancies, which include vaccination of patients with synthetic peptides derived from these LAAs. Results from these trials show that peptide vaccines are able to induce immune responses that are sometimes associated with clinical benefit. These early clinical results are promising and provide valuable information for future improvement of the vaccines. This chapter will focus mainly on discussing the preclinical studies of peptide vaccines in human systems, the results from clinical trials and the future prospects for vaccine therapy for myeloid leukaemia.",Journal Article,4159.0,13.0,development vaccines directed myeloid leukaemias research area intense past decade human studies vitro mouse models vivo demonstrated leukaemia-associated antigens LAAs fusion BCR-ABL Wilms tumour proteinase 3 serve effective targets cellular immunotherapy Peptide-based vaccines able induce cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses kill leukaemia Based pilot clinical trials initiated chronic acute myeloid leukaemia haematological malignancies include vaccination patients synthetic peptides derived LAAs trials peptide vaccines able induce immune responses associated clinical benefit early clinical promising provide valuable information future improvement vaccines chapter focus mainly discussing preclinical studies peptide vaccines human systems clinical trials future prospects vaccine therapy myeloid leukaemia,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 193, 1, 12, 1842, 1166, 480, 533, 12160, 71, 85, 8, 389, 965, 1, 3933, 1333, 4, 3, 1219, 2025, 110, 171, 94, 4, 439, 2, 830, 274, 4, 386, 47, 264, 17, 2001, 41, 1575, 30982, 225, 22, 3, 1212, 178, 1062, 1425, 770, 178, 2, 10974, 27, 68, 1833, 22, 323, 637, 9, 763, 726, 1389, 90, 1842, 32, 1665, 6, 1290, 759, 102, 1448, 253, 17, 5097, 2001, 37, 90, 23, 46, 99, 2281, 38, 143, 47, 85, 1917, 4, 442, 2, 286, 533, 2001, 2, 127, 5143, 441, 92, 643, 1915, 1, 7, 5, 3273, 2491, 526, 29, 46, 30982, 99, 29, 46, 143, 514, 17, 1389, 1842, 32, 1665, 6, 1290, 250, 253, 17, 32, 5164, 41, 5, 38, 247, 46, 191, 38, 99, 32, 721, 2, 377, 2926, 487, 9, 508, 767, 1, 3, 1842, 26, 6366, 303, 1222, 2615, 23, 6003, 3, 693, 94, 1, 1389, 1842, 4, 171, 1530, 3, 99, 29, 38, 143, 2, 3, 508, 9643, 9, 1274, 36, 9, 533, 2001]",1161.0,18790445,Peptide vaccines myeloid leukaemias,0,0.0

Early and late mortality after diagnosis of wilms tumor.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-01-12,"To assess rates and causes of mortality in patients with Wilms tumor (WT). Through 2002, 6,185 patients enrolled onto the National Wilms Tumor Study between 1969 and 1995 were actively observed. Deaths were classified on the basis of medical records as the result of original disease, late effects (including second malignant neoplasms [SMNs], cardiac causes, pulmonary disease, and renal failure), or other causes. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and Cox regression were used to assess the effects of sex, age, and calendar period of diagnosis on mortality. Within 5 years of WT diagnosis, 819 deaths occurred, and 159 deaths occurred among 4,972 known 5-year survivors. The SMR was 24.3 (95% CI, 22.6 to 26.0) for the first 5 years, was 12.6 (95% CI, 10.0 to 15.7) for the next 5 years, and remained greater than 3.0 thereafter. For deaths in the first 5 years, the mortality risk decreased by 5-year calendar period of diagnosis (rate ratio [RR] = 0.78 per period). No such trend occurred for later deaths.

Predicting relapse in favorable histology Wilms tumor using gene expression analysis: a report from the Renal Tumor Committee of the Children's Oncology Group.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2009-02-10,"The past two decades has seen significant improvement in the overall survival of patients with favorable histology Wilms tumor (FHWT); however, this progress has reached a plateau. Further improvements may rely on the ability to better stratify patients by risk of relapse. This study determines the feasibility and potential clinical utility of classifiers of relapse based on global gene expression analysis. Two hundred fifty FHWT of all stages enriched for relapses treated on National Wilms Tumor Study-5 passed quality variables and were suitable for analysis using oligonucleotide arrays. Relapse risk stratification used support vector machine; 2- and 10-fold cross-validations were applied. The number of genes associated with relapse was less than that predicted by chance alone for 106 patients (32 relapses) with stages I and II FHWT treated with chemotherapy, and no further analyses were done. This number was greater than expected by chance for 76 local stage III patients. Cross-validation including an additional 68 local stage III patients (total 144 patients, 53 relapses) showed that classifiers for relapse composed of 50 genes were associated with a median sensitivity of 47% and specificity of 70%. This study shows the feasibility and modest accuracy of stratifying local stage III FHWT using a classifier of <50 genes. Validation using an independent patient population is needed. Analysis of genes differentially expressed in relapse patients revealed apoptosis, Wnt signaling, insulin-like growth factor pathway, and epigenetic modification to be mechanisms important in relapse.

Intraoperative spillage of favorable histology wilms tumor cells: influence of irradiation and chemotherapy regimens on abdominal recurrence. A report from the National Wilms Tumor Study Group.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2010-01-01,"We undertook this study to determine (1) the frequency with which spilled tumor cells of favorable histology produced intra-abdominal disease in patients treated with differing chemotherapy regimens and abdominal radiation therapy (RT) and (2) the patterns of relapse and outcomes in such patients. The influence of RT dose (0, 10, and 20 Gy), RT fields (flank, whole abdomen), and chemotherapy with dactinomycin and vincristine (2 drugs) vs. added doxorubicin (three drugs) on intra-abdominal tumor recurrence rates was analyzed by logistic regression in 450 patients. Each patient was considered at risk for two types of failure: flank and subdiaphragmatic beyond-flank recurrence, with the correlation between the two outcomes accounted for in the analyses. The crude odds ratio for the risk of recurrence relative to no RT was 0.35 (0.15-0.78) for 10Gy and 0.08 (0.01-0.58) for 20Gy. The odds ratio for the risk of recurrence for doxorubicin to two drugs after adjusting for RT was not significant. For Stage II patients (NWTS-4), the 8-year event rates with and without spillage, respectively, were 79% and 87% for relapse-free survival (p = 0.07) and 90% and 95% for overall survival (p = 0.04). Irradiation (10 Gy or 20 Gy) reduced abdominal tumor recurrence rates after tumor spillage. Tumor spillage in Stage II patients reduced relapse-free survival and overall survival, but only the latter was of statistical significance.

Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-secreting cellular immunotherapy in combination with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) as postremission therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML).,Blood,Blood,2009-06-25,"Preclinical models have demonstrated the efficacy of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-secreting cancer immunotherapies (GVAX platform) accompanied by immunotherapy-primed lymphocytes after autologous stem cell transplantation in hematologic malignancies. We conducted a phase 2 study of this combination in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Immunotherapy consisted of autologous leukemia cells admixed with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-secreting K562 cells. ""Primed"" lymphocytes were collected after a single pretransplantation dose of immunotherapy and reinfused with the stem cell graft. Fifty-four subjects were enrolled; 46 (85%) achieved a complete remission, and 28 (52%) received the pretransplantation immunotherapy. For all patients who achieved complete remission, the 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rate was 47.4% and overall survival was 57.4%. For the 28 immunotherapy-treated patients, the RFS and overall survival rates were 61.8% and 73.4%, respectively. Posttreatment induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions to autologous leukemia cells was associated with longer 3-year RFS rate (100% vs 48%). Minimal residual disease was monitored by quantitative analysis of Wilms tumor-1 (WT1), a leukemia-associated gene. A decrease in WT1 transcripts in blood was noted in 69% of patients after the first immunotherapy dose and was also associated with longer 3-year RFS (61% vs 0%).

Portal hypertension in children with Wilms' tumor: a report from the National Wilms' Tumor Study Group.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2009-08-19,"This analysis was undertaken to determine the cumulative risk of and risk factors for portal hypertension (PHTN) in patients with Wilms' tumor (WT). Medical records were reviewed to identify cases of PHTN identified with late liver/spleen/gastric toxicities in a cohort of 5,195 patients treated with National Wilms' Tumor Studies (NWTS) protocols 1 to 4. A nested case control study (5 controls/case) was conducted to determine relationships among doxorubicin, radiation therapy (RT) dose to the liver, patient gender, and PHTN. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of PHTN associated with these factors. Cumulative risk of PHTN at 6 years from WT diagnosis was 0.7% for patients with right-sided tumors vs. 0.1% for those with left-sided tumors (p = 0.002). Seventeen of 19 cases were evaluable for RT. The majority of cases (16/17 [94%]) received right-flank RT either alone or as part of whole-abdomen RT and received >15 Gy to the liver. Fifteen of 17 (88%) patients received a higher dose to the liver than they would have with modern WT protocols. Controlling for RT dose, the HR was 3.0 for patients who received doxorubicin (p = 0.32) and 2.8 for females (p = 0.15). Controlling for doxorubicin, the 95% lower confidence bound on the HR associating PHTN with a minimum liver RT dose of >15 Gy vs. <or=15 Gy was 2.5 (p = 0.001); it was 2.4 for a maximum liver dose of >15 Gy vs. <or=15 Gy (p = 0.001).

A total of 742 patients (pts) with stage IV disease were assessed for EFS (95% confidence interval [CI]) at 5 years after diagnosis. Cohorts included those who underwent resection of the liver lesions compared with those who received only chemotherapy and radiotherapy. A total of 742 patients with stage IV Wilms tumor were enrolled on NWTS-4 and 5, 111 of who had liver metastases. Of these, 96 had favorable histology disease and are the focus of this analysis. Twenty-two patients had a primary liver resection (wedge resection, 18 and lobectomy, 4). After chemotherapy and/or radiation, 13 patients underwent liver resection (wedge resection, 7; lobectomy, 5; and trisegmentectomy, 1). Seventy-one patients (67%) did not undergo surgery for their liver disease. In 14 patients, the liver disease disappeared with chemotherapy only. Eighty-two patients received abdominal radiation.

Subjects 1, 2, and 3 (ages 5, 2, and 1 year) presented with a Wilms tumor and underwent surgical resection. Each patient underwent ovarian autotransplantation to move ovarian tissue out of the radiation field. Subjects 1 and 2 had thin slices from 1 ovary placed in the arm. Subject 3 had a free transfer of the entire ovary into an axilla. Follow-up was obtained for the subsequent 20-25 years for all 3 subjects. Pubertal, menarcheal, and menstrual history, and hormonal serum levels. All subjects survived and experienced spontaneous pubertal development and menarche. Data were available for follow-up for 20-25 years. Subjects 1 and 2 showed spontaneous follicular development of the autotransplanted ovarian tissue.

"Subsets of very low risk Wilms tumor show distinctive gene expression, histologic, and clinical features.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2009-11-10,"Recent studies suggest that children <24 months with stage I favorable histology Wilms tumors <550 g [very low risk Wilms tumors (VLRWT)] have an excellent prognosis when treated with nephrectomy only, without adjuvant chemotherapy. The identification of risk categories within VLRWT may enable refinement of their definition and optimization of their therapy. To define biologically distinct subsets, global gene expression analysis was done on 39 VLRWT that passed all quality-control parameters and the clusters identified were validated in an independent set of 11 VLRWT. Validation of select differentially expressed genes was done with immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray from 20 of 39 tumors. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for 11p15, 1p, and 16q was analyzed in 52 tumors using PCR. Two distinctive clusters were identified. One cluster included 9 tumors with epithelial differentiated tubular histology, paucity of nephrogenic rests, lack of LOH for 1p, 16q, and 11p, absence of relapse, and a unique gene expression profile consistent with arrest following mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. The second cluster included 13 tumors with mixed histology, intralobar nephrogenic rests, and decreased expression of WT1. Three of 6 relapses occurred in this cluster. Of 43 informative tumors, 11p LOH was present in 5 of 5 relapses and 11 of 38 nonrelapses. Two subsets comprising a total of 56% of VLRWT are identified that have pathogenetic and molecular differences and apparent differences in risk for relapse.

Secondary malignant neoplasms after Wilms tumor: an international collaborative study.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2010-08-01,"A combined cohort of 8,884 North American, 2,893 British and 1,574 Nordic subjects with Wilms tumor (WT) diagnosed before 15 years of age during 1960-2004 was established to determine the risk of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMN). After 169,641 person-years (PY) of observation through 2005, 174 solid tumors (exclusive of basal cell carcinomas) and 28 leukemias were ascertained in 195 subjects. Median survival time after a solid SMN diagnosis 5 years or more from WT was 11 years; it was 10 months for all leukemia. Age-specific incidence of secondary solid tumors increased from approximately 1 case per 1,000 PY at age 15 to 5 cases per 1,000 PY at age 40. The cumulative incidence of solid tumors at age 40 for subjects who survived free of SMNs to age 15 was 6.7%. Leukemia risk, by contrast, was highest during the first 5 years after WT diagnosis. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for solid tumors and leukemias were 5.1 and 5.0, respectively. Results for solid tumors for the 3 geographic areas were remarkably consistent; statistical tests for differences in incidence rates and SIRs were all negative. Age-specific incidence rates and SIRs for solid tumors were lower for patients whose WT was diagnosed after 1980, although the trends with decade of diagnosis were not statistically significant. Incidence rates and SIRs for leukemia were highest among those diagnosed after 1990 (p-trend = 0.003).

Decision analysis to compare treatment strategies for Stage I/favorable histology Wilms tumor.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2010-07-01,"Decision analysis was used to clarify differences in survival and complication rates comparing surgery alone versus surgery plus chemotherapy for Stage I, favorable histology Wilms tumor patients. A state transition model was used to simulate treatment with nephrectomy-only, nephrectomy with adjuvant vincristine (VCR) or with vincristine plus dactinomcyin (NWTS Regimen EE4A). Rates of relapse and complications of therapy were obtained from the literature. In sensitivity analysis, the model was probed for the value(s) at which the treatment of choice changes. The overall survival (OS) is essentially the same for patients treated with any of the three strategies (OS(Nephrectomy) = 98.8%; OS(EE4A) = 98.8%; OS(VCR) = 98.6%). Rates of serious long-term complications in the surviving population are also similar across treatment strategies (nephrectomy = 1.4%; VCR = 1.2%; EE4A = 0.3%). Both the progression and salvage rates after nephrectomy-only would have to be much worse than expected for nephrectomy-only to be an unacceptable strategy. The differences in overall survival and rates of long-term complications between the three different initial strategies were negligible in the model. Based on this analysis, it was decided by the Children's Oncology Group that it was acceptable to continue to include nephrectomy without adjuvant chemotherapy as an experimental arm of the low risk Wilms tumor protocol with stringent eligibility criteria and close follow-up.

Long-term outcomes for infants with very low risk Wilms tumor treated with surgery alone in National Wilms Tumor Study-5.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2010-03-01,"To determine the event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of children with very low risk Wilms tumor (VLRWT) treated with surgery only. Previous studies suggested that postoperative chemotherapy had not improved the prognosis of children with VLRWT. A total of 77 children <24 months of age with small (<550 g) Stage I favorable histology Wilms tumors were treated with surgery only. This study was closed based on stopping rules to ensure that the 2-year EFS was > or =90%. A total of 77 children were assessed for EFS and OS. Of these patients, 21 enrolled at the time of closure were recalled, treated with dactinomycin and vincristine (regimen EE4A), and censored for analysis thereafter. About 111 children subsequently treated with EE4A were available for comparison. Median follow-up of surviving patients was 8.2 years for surgery only (range, 1.9-11.8 years) and 5.2 years for the EE4A group (range, 1.6-8.9 years). The estimated 5-year EFS for surgery only was 84% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 73%, 91%); for the EE4A patients it was 97% (95% CI: 92%, 99%, P = 0.002). One death was observed in each treatment group. The estimated 5-year OS was 98% (95% CI: 87%, 99%) for surgery only and 99% (95% CI: 94%, 99%) for EE4A (P = 0.70). The surgery-only EFS was lower than anticipated but, coupled with a much higher than anticipated salvage rate of the chemotherapy naive patients whose disease recurred, led to an observed long-term OS equivalent to that seen with 2-drug chemotherapy.

FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography studies of Wilms' tumor.,European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,Eur. J. Nucl. Med. Mol. Imaging,2010-03-04,"The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the utility of FDG PET/CT scanning in patients with Wilms' tumors. A total of 58 scans were performed in 27 patients (14 male, 13 female; ages: 1.9-23 years, median: 7 years) with proven Wilms' tumor. Twenty-six patients (56 scans) were studied at the time of suspected relapse, progressive disease, persistent disease, or for monitoring of therapy. In the 27 patients with Wilms' tumor, 34 scans showed areas of abnormal uptake consistent with metabolically active tumors. Of the patients, 8 (24 scans) had pulmonary metastases larger than 10 mm in diameter, 10 (12 scans) had hepatic metastases, 11 (11 scans) had regional nodal involvement, 3 (3 scans) had bone metastases, 1 (1 scan) had chest wall involvement, 2 (2 scans) had pancreatic metastasis, and 5 (5 scans) had abdominal and pelvic soft tissue involvement. Two of eight patients with lung metastases had variable uptakes. Lung lesions 10 mm or smaller were not consistently visualized on PET scans. One patient with a liver metastasis showed no uptake on PET scan after treatment (size decreased from 45 to 15 mm). Most Wilms' tumors concentrate FDG. However, small pulmonary metastases may be better visualized with CT.

Vaccination with synthetic analog peptides derived from WT1 oncoprotein induces T-cell responses in patients with complete remission from acute myeloid leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2010-04-16,"A pilot study was undertaken to assess the safety, activity, and immunogenicity of a polyvalent Wilms tumor gene 1 (WT1) peptide vaccine in patients with acute myeloid leukemia in complete remission but with molecular evidence of WT1 transcript. Patients received 6 vaccinations with 4 WT1 peptides (200 microg each) plus immune adjuvants over 12 weeks. Immune responses were evaluated by delayed-type hypersensitivity, CD4+ T-cell proliferation, CD3+ T-cell interferon-gamma release, and WT1 peptide tetramer staining. Of the 9 evaluable patients, 7 completed 6 vaccinations and WT1-specific T-cell responses were noted in 7 of 8 patients. Three patients who were HLA-A0201-positive showed significant increase in interferon-gamma-secreting cells and frequency of WT1 tetramer-positive CD8+ T cells. Three patients developed a delayed hypersensitivity reaction after vaccination. Definite related toxicities were minimal. With a mean follow-up of 30 plus or minus 8 months after diagnosis, median disease-free survival has not been reached. These preliminary data suggest that this polyvalent WT1 peptide vaccine can be administered safely to patients with a resulting immune response.

Mutations of the Wilms tumor 1 gene (WT1) in older patients with primary cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia: a Cancer and Leukemia Group B study.,Blood,Blood,2010-05-04,"We previously reported the adverse prognostic impact of Wilms tumor 1 gene (WT1) mutations in younger adult cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). Here, we investigated 243 older (> or = 60 years) primary CN-AML patients. WT1 mutated (WT1mut) patients (7%) had FLT3-ITD more frequently (P < .001), lower hemoglobin (P = .01), higher white blood cell count (P = .03) and percentage blood blasts (P = .03), and a shorter overall survival (P = .08) than WT1 wild-type (WT1wt) patients. Comparing older and younger WT1mut patients, they had similar pretreatment characteristics and outcome. By contrast, among WT1wt CN-AML, younger patients had a significantly better outcome. A WT1 mutation-associated gene-expression signature, reported here for the first time, included CD96, a leukemia stem cell-specific marker, and genes involved in gene regulation (eg, MLL, PML, and SNRPN) and in proliferative and metabolic processes (eg, INSR, IRS2, and PRKAA1), supporting the role of mutated WT1 in deregulating multiple homeostatic processes. Our results indicate that WT1mut CN-AML represents a distinct entity with poor treatment response across age groups.

Outcomes of children with favorable histology wilms tumor and peritoneal implants treated in National Wilms Tumor Studies-4 and -5.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2010-06-01,"There are no published reports on the optimal management and survival rates of children with Wilms tumor (WT) and peritoneal implants (PIs). Among favorable histology WT patients enrolled in the National Wilms Tumor Study (NWTS)-4 and NWTS-5, 57 children had PIs at the time of nephrectomy. The median age was 3 years 5 months (range, 3 months to 14 years). The majority of children (42 of 57 [74%)] had Stage III tumors; 15 had Stage IV disease. All patients received multimodality therapy. Of 56 children who underwent primary surgery, 48 (84%) had gross total resection of all tumors. All patients received 3-drug chemotherapy with vincristine, dactinomycin, and doxorubicin. Whole-abdomen radiotherapy (RT) was used in 47 patients (82%), and in 50 patients (88%) the RT dose was 10.5 Gy. After a median follow-up of 7.5 years, the overall abdominal and systemic tumor control rates were 97% and 93%, respectively. A comparative analysis between children with PIs and those without PIs showed no significant differences in the clinical characteristics between the two groups.

We reviewed pregnancy outcomes among female survivors and partners of male survivors of WT treated on National Wilms Tumor Studies 1, 2, 3, and 4 by using a maternal questionnaire and a review of both maternal and offspring medical records. We received reports of 1,021 pregnancies with duration of 20 weeks or longer, including 955 live-born singletons, for whom 700 sets of maternal and offspring medical records were reviewed. Rates of hypertension complicating pregnancy (International Classification of Diseases [ICD] code 642), early or threatened labor (ICD-644) and malposition of the fetus (ICD-652) increased with increasing radiation dose in female patients. The percentages of offspring weighing less than 2,500 g at birth and of those having less than 37 weeks of gestation also increased with dose. There was no significant trend with radiation dose in the number of congenital anomalies recorded in offspring of female patients. Women who receive flank radiation therapy as part of the treatment for unilateral WT are at increased risk of hypertension complicating pregnancy, fetal malposition, and premature labor. The offspring of these women are at risk for low birth weight and premature (ie, < 37 weeks gestation) birth.

Heat shock protein 90 regulates the expression of Wilms tumor 1 protein in myeloid leukemias.,Blood,Blood,2010-07-22,"The aberrant overexpression of Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) in myeloid leukemia plays an important role in blast cell survival and resistance to chemotherapy. High expression of WT1 is also associated with relapse and shortened disease-free survival in patients. However, the mechanisms by which WT1 expression is regulated in leukemia remain unclear. Here, we report that heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), which plays a critical role in the folding and maturation of several oncogenic proteins, associates with WT1 protein and stabilizes its expression. Pharmacologic inhibition of Hsp90 resulted in ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-dependant degradation of WT1. RNAi-mediated silencing of WT1 reduced the survival of leukemia cells and increased the sensitivity of these cells to chemotherapy and Hsp90 inhibition. Furthermore, Hsp90 inhibitors 17-AAG [17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin] and STA-9090 significantly reduced the growth of myeloid leukemia xenografts in vivo and effectively down-regulated the expression of WT1 and its downstream target proteins, c-Myc and Bcl-2. Collectively, our studies identify WT1 as a novel Hsp90 client and support the crucial role for the WT1-Hsp90 interaction in maintaining leukemia cell survival. These findings have significant implications for developing effective therapies for myeloid leukemias and offer a strategy to inhibit the oncogenic functions of WT1 by clinically available Hsp90 inhibitors.",Journal Article,3470.0,28.0,aberrant overexpression Wilms 1 WT1 myeloid leukemia plays important role blast survival resistance chemotherapy High expression WT1 associated relapse shortened disease-free survival patients mechanisms WT1 expression regulated leukemia remain unclear report heat shock 90 Hsp90 plays critical role folding maturation oncogenic associates WT1 stabilizes expression Pharmacologic inhibition Hsp90 resulted ubiquitination subsequent proteasome-dependant degradation WT1 RNAi-mediated silencing WT1 reduced survival leukemia increased sensitivity chemotherapy Hsp90 inhibition Furthermore Hsp90 inhibitors 17-AAG 17- allylamino -17-demethoxygeldanamycin STA-9090 significantly reduced growth myeloid leukemia xenografts vivo effectively down-regulated expression WT1 downstream target c-Myc Bcl-2 Collectively studies identify WT1 novel Hsp90 client support crucial role WT1-Hsp90 interaction maintaining leukemia survival findings significant implications developing effective therapies myeloid leukemias offer strategy inhibit oncogenic functions WT1 clinically available Hsp90 inhibitors,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1898, 851, 1, 30, 14, 3722, 4, 533, 1698, 35, 305, 200, 4, 3112, 31, 25, 2, 251, 6, 56, 64, 55, 1, 3722, 16, 120, 41, 5, 429, 2, 6151, 34, 115, 25, 4, 7, 137, 3, 483, 20, 92, 3722, 55, 16, 1065, 4, 918, 1200, 467, 21, 414, 17, 3545, 3971, 178, 424, 2515, 92, 1698, 8, 740, 200, 4, 3, 12992, 2, 4537, 1, 392, 1302, 652, 7326, 5, 3722, 178, 2, 11019, 211, 55, 2788, 297, 1, 2515, 627, 4, 8258, 2, 706, 1694, 23612, 2373, 1, 3722, 5881, 517, 2077, 1, 3722, 405, 3, 25, 1, 37, 2, 101, 3, 485, 1, 46, 37, 6, 56, 2, 2515, 297, 798, 2515, 222, 269, 4513, 269, 10419, 269, 10051, 2, 15337, 46134, 97, 405, 3, 129, 1, 533, 1348, 4, 386, 2, 1856, 1328, 1065, 3, 55, 1, 3722, 2, 211, 1489, 283, 652, 256, 1371, 2, 1044, 18, 2535, 114, 94, 255, 3722, 22, 8, 229, 2515, 7304, 2, 538, 3, 2653, 200, 9, 3, 3722, 2515, 915, 4, 3284, 31, 25, 46, 272, 47, 93, 1268, 9, 931, 323, 235, 9, 533, 2792, 2, 1918, 8, 692, 6, 1433, 3, 1302, 1681, 1, 3722, 20, 505, 390, 2515, 222]",1378.0,20651072,Heat shock 90 regulates expression Wilms 1 myeloid leukemias,0,0.0

Infrequent tumor initiative of the Children's Oncology Group: initial lessons learned and their impact on future plans.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2010-10-18,"The merger of the Pediatric Oncology Group, Children's Cancer Group, the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group, and the National Wilms Tumor Study Group in 2000 offered the newly formed Children's Oncology Group (COG), an opportunity to study rare cancers that had not been the subject of organized evaluation within the context of a cooperative group. In 2002, the COG formed the rare tumor committee which is comprised of four subcommittees. This article details the experience of the infrequent tumor subcommittee for the period of 2002 to 2007. During the initial implementation of this strategy, we have observed low rates of registration within the COG registry and low levels of participation in open banking, biology, and first-line therapeutic studies.

WT1 mutation and 11P15 loss of heterozygosity predict relapse in very low-risk wilms tumors treated with surgery alone: a children's oncology group study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2010-12-28,"Children's Oncology Group defines very low-risk Wilms tumors (VLRWT) as stage I favorable histology Wilms tumors weighing less than 550 g in children younger than 24 months of age. VLRWTs may be treated with nephrectomy alone. However, 10% to 15% of VLRWTs relapse without chemotherapy. Previous studies suggest that VLRWTs with low WT1 expression and/or 11p15 loss of heterozygosity (LOH) may have increased risk of relapse. The current study validates these findings within prospectively identified children with VLRWT who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Fifty-six VLRWTs (10 relapses) were analyzed for mutation of WT1, CTNNB1, and WTX; for 11p15 LOH using microsatellite analysis; and for H19DMR and KvDMR1 methylation. 11p15 LOH was identified in 19 (41%) of 46 evaluable VLRWTs and was significantly associated with relapse (P < .001); 16 of 19 were isodisomic for 11p15. WT1 mutation was identified in nine (20%) of 45 evaluable VLRWTs and was significantly associated with relapse (P = .004); all nine cases also had 11p15 LOH. All evaluable tumors showing LOH by microsatellite analysis also showed LOH by methylation analysis. Retention of the normal imprinting pattern was identified in 24 of 42 evaluable tumors, and none relapsed. Loss of imprinting at 11p15 was identified in one of 42 tumors. WT1 mutation and 11p15 LOH are associated with relapse in patients with VLRWTs who do not receive chemotherapy. These may provide meaningful biomarkers to stratify patients for reduced chemotherapy in the future.

Surg.,2011-05-01,"To provide guidelines for future trials, we reviewed the outcomes of children with synchronous bilateral Wilms tumors (BWT) treated on National Wilms Tumor Study-4 (NWTS-4). NWTS-4 enrolled 3335 patients including 188 patients with BWT (5.6%). Treatment and outcome data were collected. Among 188 BWT patients registered with NWTS-4, 195 kidneys in 123 patients had initial open biopsy, 44 kidneys in 31 patients had needle biopsies. Although pre-resection chemotherapy was recommended, 87 kidneys in 83 patients were managed with primary resection: Complete nephrectomy 48 in 48 patients, 31 partial/wedge nephrectomies in 27 patients, enucleations 8 in 8 patients. No initial surgery was performed in 45 kidneys in 43 patients, 5 kidneys in 3 patients not coded. Anaplasia was diagnosed after completion of the initial course of chemotherapy in 14 patients (initial surgical procedure: 9 open biopsies, 4 needle biopsies, 1 partial nephrectomy). The average number of days from the start of chemotherapy to diagnosis of anaplasia was 390 (range 44-1925 days). Relapse or progression of disease occurred in 54 children. End stage renal failure occurred in 23 children, 6 of whom had bilateral nephrectomies. The 8 year event free survival for BWT with favorable histology was 74%, and overall survival was 89%; whereas the event free survival for BWT with unfavorable histology was 40%, overall survival was 45%. The current analysis of patients with BWT treated on NWTS-4 shows that preservation of renal parenchyma is possible in many patients after initial preoperative chemotherapy. The incidence of end-stage renal disease remains significantly higher in children with BWT.

To validate this finding, we investigated pretreatment features and outcome associated with rs16754 in a large cohort of patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia. Four-hundred and thirty-three intensively treated and molecularly characterized cytogenetically normal patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (18-83 years old) were analyzed for rs16754. To gain biological insights, we studied the gene- and microRNA-expression profiles for associations with rs16754. Three-hundred and nine (71%) patients were homozygous for A (WT1(AA)), 112 (26%) were heterozygous (WT1(AG)) and 12 (3%) were homozygous for G (WT1(GG)). For comparison with previous studies, we grouped WT1(AG) and WT1(GG) patients and compared them with WT1(AA) patients divided into younger (<60 years) and older (≥60 years) adults. We found no independent prognostic impact of WT1(AA). However, WT1(GG) patients, who were less often Caucasian than WT1(AG) (P=0.001) or WT1(AA) (P=0.008) patients, and had TET2 mutations more often than WT1(AG) (P=0.02) patients, had, among patients with FLT3-internal tandem duplication and/or NPM1 wild-type, better disease-free (P=0.02) and overall survival (P=0.04) than WT1(AA) and WT1(AG) patients combined. Unsupervised and supervised analyses of the gene- and microRNA-expression profiles suggested that there were no distinct expression patterns associated with any rs16754 genotype. We did not observe the previously reported adverse impact of WT1(AA) but found favorable outcomes associated with the homozygous WT1(GG). Considering its low frequency, confirmatory studies are necessary. The biological significance of rs16754 remains questionable as no distinct expression profiles were associated with the genotypes.",Journal Article,3148.0,16.0,alleles Wilms 1 WT1 polymorphism rs16754 harbor adenine guanine G Recently rs16754 reported affect outcome patients cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia validate finding investigated pretreatment features outcome associated rs16754 large cohort patients cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia Four-hundred thirty-three intensively treated molecularly characterized cytogenetically normal patients novo acute myeloid leukemia 18-83 years old rs16754 gain insights studied gene- microRNA-expression profiles associations rs16754 Three-hundred 71 patients homozygous WT1 AA 112 26 heterozygous WT1 AG 12 3 homozygous G WT1 GG comparison previous studies grouped WT1 AG WT1 GG patients compared WT1 AA patients divided younger 60 years older ≥60 years adults independent prognostic impact WT1 AA WT1 GG patients Caucasian WT1 AG P=0.001 WT1 AA P=0.008 patients TET2 WT1 AG P=0.02 patients patients FLT3-internal tandem duplication and/or NPM1 wild-type better disease-free P=0.02 overall survival P=0.04 WT1 AA WT1 AG patients combined Unsupervised supervised gene- microRNA-expression profiles suggested distinct expression patterns associated rs16754 genotype observe previously reported adverse impact WT1 AA favorable outcomes associated homozygous WT1 GG Considering low frequency confirmatory studies necessary significance rs16754 remains questionable distinct expression profiles associated genotypes,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 2558, 1, 3, 30, 14, 3722, 1907, 27066, 2760, 16307, 8, 15, 10079, 499, 761, 27066, 71, 85, 210, 6, 1158, 3, 228, 1, 7, 5, 7809, 295, 286, 533, 6, 2183, 26, 1567, 21, 565, 1194, 404, 2, 228, 41, 5, 27066, 4, 8, 375, 180, 1, 7, 5, 7809, 295, 286, 533, 294, 1128, 2, 977, 169, 13240, 73, 2, 2372, 765, 7809, 295, 7, 5, 1566, 2018, 286, 533, 203, 852, 60, 1095, 11, 311, 9, 27066, 6, 1803, 1037, 1957, 21, 656, 3, 145, 2, 3213, 55, 1241, 9, 685, 5, 27066, 169, 1128, 2, 762, 792, 7, 11, 3189, 9, 8, 3722, 1519, 3726, 432, 11, 4167, 3722, 2741, 2, 133, 27, 11, 3189, 9, 499, 3722, 4334, 9, 1155, 5, 698, 94, 21, 3706, 3722, 2741, 2, 3722, 4334, 7, 2, 72, 1370, 5, 3722, 1519, 7, 2176, 237, 773, 335, 60, 2, 434, 6690, 60, 857, 21, 204, 77, 306, 177, 345, 1, 3722, 1519, 137, 3722, 4334, 7, 54, 11, 299, 629, 3229, 76, 3722, 2741, 19, 13, 144, 15, 3722, 1519, 19, 13, 2155, 7, 2, 42, 5038, 138, 80, 629, 76, 3722, 2741, 19, 13, 588, 7, 42, 107, 7, 5, 1224, 2329, 2905, 4616, 2, 15, 4318, 955, 267, 380, 34, 115, 19, 13, 588, 2, 63, 25, 19, 13, 755, 76, 3722, 1519, 2, 3722, 2741, 7, 397, 6512, 2, 7762, 318, 1, 3, 145, 2, 3213, 55, 1241, 1148, 17, 125, 11, 77, 834, 55, 764, 41, 5, 500, 27066, 1183, 21, 205, 44, 4635, 3, 373, 210, 290, 345, 1, 3722, 1519, 84, 204, 913, 123, 41, 5, 3, 3189, 3722, 4334, 3075, 211, 154, 675, 5697, 94, 32, 1493, 3, 1037, 724, 1, 27066, 469, 14853, 22, 77, 834, 55, 1241, 11, 41, 5, 3, 2071]",1859.0,21659357,Clinical outcome gene- microRNA-expression profiling according Wilms 1 WT1 single nucleotide polymorphism rs16754 adult novo cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia Leukemia Group B,0,0.0
Dactinomycin and vincristine toxicity in the treatment of childhood cancer: a retrospective study from the Children's Oncology Group.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2010-12-01,"Dactinomycin (AMD) and vincristine (VCR) have been used for the treatment of childhood cancer over the past 40 years but evidence-based dosing guidance is lacking. Patient AMD and VCR dose and drug-related adverse event (AE) information from four rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and two Wilms tumor (WT) studies were assembled. Statistical modeling was used to account for differences in AE data collection across studies, develop rate models for grade 3/4 CTCAE v3 hepatic- (AMD) and neuro- (VCR) toxicity, assess variation in toxicity rates over age and other factors, and predict toxicity risk under current dosing guidelines. For the same dose/body size, AMD toxicity rates were higher in patients <1 year than older patients and VCR toxicity rates increased with age. The statistical model provided estimates for AMD and VCR toxicity risk under current dosing schedules and indicated that patients of smaller body size were at lower risk of VCR toxicity than larger patients of the same age. The rate of AMD toxicity was highest early in treatment and was lower in patients who tolerated initial AMD without toxicity. The observed decrease in AMD toxicity rate with cumulative dose may indicate sensitivity in a subgroup of patients while the observed increase in VCR toxicity risk with age may indicate changing sensitivity to VCR. Current dosing practices result in a fairly uniform toxicity profile within age group.

Risk factors for end stage renal disease in non-WT1-syndromic Wilms tumor.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2011-06-17,"We assessed risk factors for end stage renal disease in patients with Wilms tumor without known WT1 related syndromes. We hypothesized that patients with characteristics suggestive of a WT1 etiology (early onset, stromal predominant histology, intralobar nephrogenic rests) would have a higher risk of end stage renal disease due to chronic renal failure. We predicted a high risk of end stage renal disease due to progressive bilateral Wilms tumor in patients with metachronous bilateral disease. End stage renal disease was ascertained in 100 of 7,950 nonsyndromic patients enrolled in a National Wilms Tumor Study during 1969 to 2002. Risk factors were evaluated with cumulative incidence curves and proportional hazard regressions. The cumulative incidence of end stage renal disease due to chronic renal failure 20 years after Wilms tumor diagnosis was 0.7%. For end stage renal disease due to progressive bilateral Wilms tumor the incidence was 4.0% at 3 years after diagnosis in patients with synchronous bilateral Wilms tumor and 19.3% in those with metachronous bilateral Wilms tumor. For end stage renal disease due to chronic renal failure stromal predominant histology had a HR of 6.4 relative to mixed (95% CI 3.4, 11.9; p<0.001), intralobar rests had a HR of 5.9 relative to no rests (95% CI 2.0, 17.3; p=0.001), and Wilms tumor diagnosis at less than 24 months had a HR of 1.7 relative to 24 to 48 months and 2.8 relative to greater than 48 months (p=0.003 for trend). Metachronous bilateral Wilms tumor is associated with high rates of end stage renal disease due to surgery for progressive Wilms tumor.

Evaluation of polymorphisms in EWSR1 and risk of Ewing sarcoma: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2011-07-25,"Ewing sarcoma is a malignant bone tumor characterized by a high frequency of somatic EWSR1 translocations.

Germline DNA from white patients with Ewing sarcoma (n = 135), white controls with Wilms tumor (n = 200), and African-American controls (n = 285) was genotyped at 21 SNPs in the EWSR1 gene. Intron 7 of EWSR1, the most common site of translocation, was also sequenced in all subjects. Genetic variation between groups was evaluated statistically using exact logistic regression and Fisher exact tests. One SNP in EWSR1 (rs2857461) showed a low level of statistical association with the diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma compared to Wilms tumor. The odds ratio for having Ewing sarcoma in people with at least one copy of the minor allele of rs2857461 was 3.57 (95% confidence interval 0.79-21.7; P = 0.07). No other SNPs or variations in intron 7 of EWSR1 were associated with Ewing sarcoma. The median relative difference in minor allele frequencies between white subjects with Ewing sarcoma and African-American controls at the evaluated EWSR1 SNPs was 45%.

The study investigated pain prevalence in this population compared with sibling controls and examined pain-related risk factors. Three self-reported pain outcomes including pain conditions, prescription analgesics used, and pain attributed to cancer and treatment were assessed among 10,397 cancer survivors and 3034 sibling controls from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. Pain conditions (pain/abnormal sensation, migraines, and other headaches) were reported by 12.3%, 15.5%, and 20.5% of survivors, respectively; 16.7% of survivors reported use of prescription analgesics, and 21% attributed pain to cancer and treatment. Risks of reporting pain conditions and using prescription analgesics were higher among survivors than siblings, adjusting for sociodemographic factors. Younger age at diagnosis and a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Wilms tumor, or neuroblastoma (compared to leukemia) were associated with greater risk of reporting pain conditions. A history of bone cancer or soft tissue sarcoma (compared to leukemia) was associated with greater risks of using prescription analgesics and cancer-related pain attribution. Non-brain-directed scatter irradiation was associated with elevated risk for migraines and cancer-related pain attribution. Female gender and lower educational attainment were associated with increased reports of all 3 pain outcomes; minority status, unemployment, and being single were associated with greater risks for reporting pain conditions.

Clinical significance of pulmonary nodules detected by CT and Not CXR in patients treated for favorable histology Wilms tumor on national Wilms tumor studies-4 and -5: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2012-03-15,"Metastatic lung disease in Wilms tumor (WT) patients was traditionally identified by chest radiograph (CXR). It is unclear whether patients with small lesions, detectable only by computed tomography (""CT-only"" lesions), require the more intensive therapy, including doxorubicin and lung irradiation, given to patients with metastases detectable by CXR. This study involved 417 patients with favorable histology WT and isolated lung metastases (detected by CXR or CT) who were registered on National Wilms tumor Study (NWTS)-4 or -5. Outcomes by method of detection (CXR vs. CT-only), use of lung radiation, and 2- or 3-drug chemotherapy (dactinomycin and vincristine ± doxorubicin) were determined and compared using the log-rank test. There were 231 patients with lung lesions detected by CXR and 186 by CT-only. Of the patients with CT-only nodules, 37 received only 2 drugs and 101 did not receive lung radiation. Five-year event-free survival (EFS) was greater for patients receiving three drugs (including doxorubicin) with or without lung radiation than for those receiving two drugs (80% vs. 56%; P = 0.004). There was no difference seen in 5-year overall survival (OS) between the 3- and 2-drug subsets (87% vs. 86%; P = 0.91). There were no significant differences in EFS (82% vs. 72%; P = 0.13) or OS (91% vs. 83%; P = 0.46) for patients with CT-only nodules whether they received lung radiation or not.

Lymph node involvement in Wilms tumor: results from National Wilms Tumor Studies 4 and 5.,Journal of pediatric surgery,J. Pediatr. Surg.,2012-04-01,"The aim of the study was to determine the prognostic impact of lymph node (LN) involvement and sampling in patients with Wilms tumor (WT) and the minimum number of LNs needed for accurate staging. We reviewed all patients with unilateral, nonmetastatic WT enrolled in the National Wilms Tumor Study 4 or 5. Data were abstracted on patient demographics, tumor histology, staging, number of LNs sampled, and disease-specific and overall patient outcomes. A total of 3409 patients had complete information on LN sampling. Five-year event-free survival (EFS) was lower in patients with nodal disease (P < .001); the effect of LN positivity was greater for patients with anaplastic (P = .047) than with favorable histology (P = .02). The likelihood of obtaining a positive LN was higher when sampling at least 7 LNs. However, after controlling for tumor histology and stage, the number of LNs sampled did not predict EFS variations (P = .75).

Human Langerhans cells use an IL-15R-α/IL-15/pSTAT5-dependent mechanism to break T-cell tolerance against the self-differentiation tumor antigen WT1.,Blood,Blood,2012-04-17,"Human CD34(+) progenitor-derived Langerhans-type dendritic cells (LCs) are more potent stimulators of T-cell immunity against tumor and viral antigens in vitro than are monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs). The exact mechanisms have remained elusive until now, however. LCs synthesize the highest amounts of IL-15R-α mRNA and protein, which binds IL-15 for presentation to responder lymphocytes, thereby signaling the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (pSTAT5). LCs electroporated with Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) mRNA achieve sufficiently sustained presentation of antigenic peptides, which together with IL-15R-α/IL-15, break tolerance against WT1 by stimulating robust autologous, WT1-specific cytolytic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). These CTLs develop from healthy persons after only 7 days' stimulation without exogenous cytokines and lyse MHC-restricted tumor targets, which include primary WT1(+) leukemic blasts. In contrast, moDCs require exogenous rhuIL-15 to phosphorylate STAT5 and attain stimulatory capacity comparable to LCs. LCs therefore provide a more potent costimulatory cytokine milieu for T-cell activation than do moDCs, thus accounting for their superior stimulation of MHC-restricted Ag-specific CTLs without need for exogenous cytokines. These data support the use of mRNA-electroporated LCs, or moDCs supplemented with exogenous rhuIL-15, as vaccines for cancer immunotherapy to break tolerance against self-differentiation antigens shared by tumors.",Clinical Trial,2835.0,35.0,Human CD34 progenitor-derived Langerhans-type dendritic LCs potent stimulators T-cell immunity viral antigens vitro monocyte-derived DCs moDCs exact mechanisms remained elusive LCs synthesize highest amounts IL-15R-α mRNA binds IL-15 presentation responder lymphocytes signaling phosphorylation signal transducer activator transcription 5 pSTAT5 LCs electroporated Wilms 1 WT1 mRNA achieve sufficiently sustained presentation antigenic peptides IL-15R-α/IL-15 break tolerance WT1 stimulating robust autologous WT1-specific cytolytic T-lymphocytes CTLs CTLs develop healthy persons 7 days stimulation exogenous cytokines lyse MHC-restricted targets include primary WT1 leukemic blasts contrast moDCs require exogenous rhuIL-15 phosphorylate STAT5 attain stimulatory capacity comparable LCs LCs provide potent costimulatory cytokine milieu T-cell activation moDCs accounting superior stimulation MHC-restricted Ag-specific CTLs need exogenous cytokines support use mRNA-electroporated LCs moDCs supplemented exogenous rhuIL-15 vaccines immunotherapy break tolerance self-differentiation antigens shared,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[171, 2215, 2520, 526, 15702, 267, 2464, 37, 8348, 32, 80, 1157, 19438, 1, 102, 31, 1604, 480, 30, 2, 1667, 1575, 4, 439, 76, 32, 5231, 526, 3110, 29124, 3, 2472, 483, 47, 958, 5327, 1100, 1134, 137, 8348, 11254, 3, 1076, 4939, 1, 501, 30864, 2014, 956, 2, 178, 92, 3333, 501, 167, 9, 1031, 6, 8735, 1594, 2267, 314, 3, 982, 1, 1235, 5182, 2, 3393, 1, 866, 33, 22736, 8348, 28214, 5, 30, 14, 3722, 956, 1359, 5938, 2275, 1031, 1, 8357, 2491, 92, 1162, 5, 501, 30864, 2014, 501, 167, 4338, 2614, 480, 3722, 20, 2122, 1922, 1028, 3722, 112, 6957, 102, 1594, 5416, 46, 5416, 690, 29, 1331, 4327, 50, 158, 67, 162, 2503, 187, 4181, 1886, 2, 11436, 3658, 2016, 30, 637, 92, 643, 86, 3722, 2015, 2438, 4, 748, 29124, 1353, 4181, 23977, 167, 6, 14099, 5517, 2, 10719, 6708, 2162, 1279, 6, 8348, 8348, 673, 377, 8, 80, 1157, 5555, 1675, 6795, 9, 102, 31, 363, 76, 1022, 29124, 631, 3116, 9, 136, 1123, 2503, 1, 3658, 2016, 2741, 112, 5416, 187, 594, 9, 4181, 1886, 46, 74, 538, 3, 119, 1, 956, 28214, 8348, 15, 29124, 7687, 5, 4181, 23977, 167, 22, 1842, 9, 12, 726, 6, 4338, 2614, 480, 1074, 910, 1575, 2664, 20, 57]",1447.0,22510877,Human Langerhans use IL-15R-α/IL-15/pSTAT5-dependent mechanism break T-cell tolerance self-differentiation antigen WT1,0,0.0

We performed a multivariate analysis of our institutional database to identify factors independently associated with relapse-free and overall survival. We retrospectively reviewed cases of confirmed Wilms tumor diagnosed between 1990 and 2010 and treated at our institution. The log-rank test was used to screen variables for consideration in the proportional hazards model. A total of 95 patients were treated at our institution during the study period, with a median follow-up of 3.3 years. Factors correlated with overall survival in the univariate analysis were local disease, metastasis, tumor size, anaplasia, renal vein tumor thrombus, inferior vena cava tumor thrombus, lymph node positivity, and tumor rupture. On multivariate analysis, factors associated with increased risk of death were lymph node positivity and anaplasia. Factors correlated with probability of relapse in the univariate analysis were lymph node positivity, anaplasia, and female sex. All 3 of these factors were also independently significant on multivariate analysis.

Is routine pelvic surveillance imaging necessary in patients with Wilms tumor?,Cancer,Cancer,2012-06-26,"It is unclear whether routine pelvic imaging is needed in patients with Wilms tumor. Thus, the primary objective of the current study was to examine the role of routine pelvic computed tomography (CT) in a cohort of pediatric patients with Wilms tumor. With institutional review board approval, the authors retrospectively identified 110 patients who had Wilms tumor diagnosed between January 1999 and December 2009 with surveillance imaging that continued through March 2011. The authors estimated overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and dosimetry from dose length product (DLP) conversion to the effective dose (ED) for every CT in a subgroup of 80 patients who had CT studies obtained using contemporary scanners (2002-2011). Metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) dosimeters were placed within organs of anthropomorphic phantoms to directly calculate the truncal ED. ED(DLP) was correlated with ED(MOSFET) to calculate potential pelvic dose savings. Eighty patients underwent 605 CT examinations that contained DLP information, including 352 CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis; 123 CT scans of the chest and abdomen; 102 CT scans of the chest only; 18 CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis; 9 CT scans of the abdomen only; and 1 CT that was limited to the pelvis. The respective 5-year OS and EFS estimates were 92.8% ± 3% and 2.6% ± 4.3%. Sixteen of 110 patients (15%) developed a relapse a median of 11.3 months (range, 5.0 months to 7.3 years) after diagnosis, and 4 patients died of disease recurrence. Three patients developed pelvic relapses, all 3 of which were symptomatic. The estimated ED savings from sex-neutral CT surveillance performed at a 120-kilovolt peak without pelvic imaging was calculated as 30.5% for the average patient aged 1 year, 30.4% for the average patient aged 5 years, 39.4% for the average patient aged 10 years, and 44.9% for the average patient aged 15 years. Omitting pelvic CT from the routine, off-therapy follow-up of patients with Wilms tumor saved an average 30% to 45% of the ED without compromising disease detection.",Journal Article,2765.0,11.0,unclear routine pelvic imaging needed patients Wilms primary objective current examine role routine pelvic computed tomography CT cohort pediatric patients Wilms institutional review board approval authors retrospectively identified 110 patients Wilms diagnosed January 1999 December 2009 surveillance imaging continued March 2011 authors estimated overall survival OS event-free survival EFS dosimetry dose length product DLP conversion effective dose ED CT subgroup 80 patients CT studies obtained contemporary scanners 2002-2011 Metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor MOSFET dosimeters placed organs anthropomorphic phantoms directly calculate truncal ED ED DLP correlated ED MOSFET calculate potential pelvic dose savings Eighty patients underwent 605 CT examinations contained DLP information including 352 CT scans chest abdomen pelvis 123 CT scans chest abdomen 102 CT scans chest 18 CT scans abdomen pelvis 9 CT scans abdomen 1 CT limited pelvis respective 5-year OS EFS estimates 92.8 ± 3 2.6 ± 4.3 Sixteen 110 patients 15 developed relapse median 11.3 months range 5.0 months 7.3 years diagnosis 4 patients died disease recurrence patients developed pelvic relapses 3 symptomatic estimated ED savings sex-neutral CT surveillance performed 120-kilovolt peak pelvic imaging calculated 30.5 average patient aged 1 year 30.4 average patient aged 5 years 39.4 average patient aged 10 years 44.9 average patient aged 15 years Omitting pelvic CT routine off-therapy follow-up patients Wilms saved average 30 45 ED compromising disease detection,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[192, 16, 1200, 317, 1311, 1110, 270, 16, 575, 4, 7, 5, 30, 631, 3, 86, 461, 1, 3, 291, 45, 10, 6, 1004, 3, 200, 1, 1311, 1110, 1220, 872, 425, 4, 8, 180, 1, 815, 7, 5, 30, 5, 1115, 206, 2620, 1814, 3, 738, 894, 108, 3129, 7, 54, 42, 30, 265, 59, 1024, 2043, 2, 1397, 1238, 5, 617, 270, 17, 1351, 298, 2363, 1132, 3, 738, 661, 63, 25, 118, 774, 115, 25, 1683, 2, 4113, 29, 61, 1318, 2821, 40031, 3111, 6, 3, 323, 61, 3880, 9, 454, 425, 4, 8, 1363, 1, 493, 7, 54, 42, 425, 94, 683, 75, 2667, 16765, 1544, 1132, 8545, 6608, 23444, 1067, 254, 61616, 47265, 28618, 11, 3295, 262, 2285, 1, 26561, 14546, 6, 1606, 3232, 3, 9170, 3880, 3880, 40031, 10, 438, 5, 3880, 47265, 6, 3232, 174, 1110, 61, 7003, 2207, 7, 208, 14247, 425, 4209, 17, 3070, 40031, 487, 141, 9550, 425, 1441, 1, 3, 1662, 4036, 2, 3270, 2698, 425, 1441, 1, 3, 1662, 2, 4036, 2867, 425, 1441, 1, 3, 1662, 158, 203, 425, 1441, 1, 3, 4036, 2, 3270, 83, 425, 1441, 1, 3, 4036, 158, 2, 14, 425, 17, 10, 383, 6, 3, 3270, 3, 3847, 33, 111, 118, 2, 1683, 1423, 11, 937, 66, 810, 27, 2, 18, 49, 810, 39, 27, 3228, 1, 3129, 7, 167, 276, 8, 429, 8, 52, 1, 175, 27, 53, 184, 33, 13, 53, 6, 67, 27, 60, 50, 147, 2, 39, 7, 1016, 1, 34, 146, 169, 7, 276, 1110, 3713, 62, 27, 1, 92, 11, 1704, 3, 661, 3880, 7003, 29, 1035, 6338, 425, 617, 173, 28, 8, 2031, 61617, 2944, 187, 1110, 270, 10, 981, 22, 201, 33, 9, 3, 1011, 69, 1032, 14, 111, 201, 39, 9, 3, 1011, 69, 1032, 33, 60, 587, 39, 9, 3, 1011, 69, 1032, 79, 60, 2, 584, 83, 9, 3, 1011, 69, 1032, 167, 60, 12367, 1110, 425, 29, 3, 1311, 1889, 36, 166, 126, 1, 7, 5, 30, 11806, 35, 1011, 201, 6, 512, 1, 3, 3880, 187, 6102, 34, 638]",2017.0,22736193,routine pelvic surveillance imaging necessary patients Wilms,0,0.0

Clinically relevant subsets identified by gene expression patterns support a revised ontogenic model of Wilms tumor: a Children's Oncology Group Study.,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",Neoplasia,2012-08-01,"Wilms tumors (WT) have provided broad insights into the interface between development and tumorigenesis. Further understanding is confounded by their genetic, histologic, and clinical heterogeneity, the basis of which remains largely unknown. We evaluated 224 WT for global gene expression patterns; WT1, CTNNB1, and WTX mutation; and 11p15 copy number and methylation patterns. Five subsets were identified showing distinct differences in their pathologic and clinical features: these findings were validated in 100 additional WT. The gene expression pattern of each subset was compared with published gene expression profiles during normal renal development. A novel subset of epithelial WT in infants lacked WT1, CTNNB1, and WTX mutations and nephrogenic rests and displayed a gene expression pattern of the postinduction nephron, and none recurred. Three subsets were characterized by a low expression of WT1 and intralobar nephrogenic rests. These differed in their frequency of WT1 and CTNNB1 mutations, in their age, in their relapse rate, and in their expression similarities with the intermediate mesoderm versus the metanephric mesenchyme. The largest subset was characterized by biallelic methylation of the imprint control region 1, a gene expression profile of the metanephric mesenchyme, and both interlunar and perilobar nephrogenic rests. These data provide a biologic explanation for the clinical and pathologic heterogeneity seen within WT and enable the future development of subset-specific therapeutic strategies.

Historical trends in the use of radiation therapy for pediatric cancers: 1973-2008.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-12-27,"This study was undertaken to assess historical trends in the use of radiation therapy (RT) for pediatric cancers over the past 4 decades. The National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database of the 9 original tumor registries (SEER-9) was queried to identify patients aged 0 to 19 years with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, bone and joint cancer, cancer of the brain and nervous system, Hodgkin lymphoma, neuroblastoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, soft tissue cancer, Wilms tumor, or retinoblastoma from 1973 to 2008. Patients were grouped into 4-year time epochs. The number and percentage of patients who received RT as part of their initial treatment were calculated per epoch by each diagnosis group from 1973 to 2008. RT use for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and retinoblastoma declined sharply from 57%, 57%, and 30% in 1973 to 1976 to 11%, 15%, and 2%, respectively, in 2005 to 2008. Similarly, smaller declines in RT use were also seen in brain cancer (70%-39%), bone cancer (41%-21%), Wilms tumor (75%-53%), and neuroblastoma (60%-25%). RT use curves for Wilms tumor and neuroblastoma were nonlinear with nadirs in 1993 to 1996 at 39% and 19%, respectively. There were minimal changes in RT use for Hodgkin lymphoma, soft tissue cancer, or acute myeloid leukemia, roughly stable at 72%, 40%, and 11%, respectively. Almost all patients treated with RT were given external beam RT exclusively. However, from 1985 to 2008, treatments involving brachytherapy, radioisotopes, or combination therapy increased in frequency, comprising 1.8%, 4.6%, and 11.9% of RT treatments in brain cancer, soft tissue cancer, and retinoblastoma, respectively. The use of RT is declining over time in 7 of 10 pediatric cancer categories. A limitation of this study is a potential under-ascertainment of RT use in the SEER-9 database including the delayed use of RT.",Journal Article,2581.0,41.0,undertaken assess historical trends use radiation therapy RT pediatric past 4 decades National Institute 's Surveillance Epidemiology End database 9 original registries SEER-9 queried identify patients aged 0 19 years acute lymphoblastic leukemia acute myeloid leukemia bone joint brain nervous Hodgkin lymphoma neuroblastoma non-Hodgkin lymphoma soft tissue Wilms retinoblastoma 1973 2008 Patients grouped 4-year time epochs number percentage patients received RT initial treatment calculated epoch diagnosis group 1973 2008 RT use acute lymphoblastic leukemia non-Hodgkin lymphoma retinoblastoma declined sharply 57 57 30 1973 1976 11 15 2 respectively 2005 2008 Similarly smaller declines RT use seen brain 70 -39 bone 41 -21 Wilms 75 -53 neuroblastoma 60 -25 RT use curves Wilms neuroblastoma nonlinear nadirs 1993 1996 39 19 respectively minimal changes RT use Hodgkin lymphoma soft tissue acute myeloid leukemia roughly stable 72 40 11 respectively patients treated RT given external beam RT exclusively 1985 2008 treatments involving brachytherapy radioisotopes combination therapy increased frequency comprising 1.8 4.6 11.9 RT treatments brain soft tissue retinoblastoma respectively use RT declining time 7 10 pediatric categories limitation potential under-ascertainment RT use SEER-9 database including delayed use RT,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[26, 45, 10, 2789, 6, 423, 2252, 1963, 4, 3, 119, 1, 121, 36, 240, 9, 815, 163, 252, 3, 1219, 39, 1968, 3, 657, 12, 1377, 292, 617, 1284, 2, 396, 99, 609, 1, 3, 83, 2279, 30, 3768, 1605, 83, 10, 3547, 6, 255, 7, 1032, 13, 6, 326, 60, 5, 286, 1275, 286, 533, 2, 2093, 12, 12, 1, 3, 342, 2, 1880, 398, 1214, 246, 12, 30, 15, 29, 4756, 6, 1375, 7, 11, 3706, 237, 39, 111, 98, 62247, 3, 207, 2, 1150, 1, 7, 54, 103, 240, 22, 760, 1, 136, 388, 24, 11, 981, 379, 7959, 20, 296, 147, 87, 29, 4756, 6, 1375, 240, 119, 9, 286, 1275, 2, 3054, 10833, 29, 696, 696, 2, 201, 4, 4756, 6, 8586, 6, 175, 167, 2, 18, 106, 4, 1242, 6, 1375, 1813, 2170, 4264, 4, 240, 119, 11, 120, 527, 4, 342, 12, 431, 587, 12, 605, 239, 30, 481, 699, 2, 335, 243, 240, 119, 2400, 9, 30, 2, 11, 7488, 5, 13866, 4, 3343, 6, 2648, 28, 587, 2, 326, 106, 125, 11, 1048, 400, 4, 240, 119, 9, 1214, 246, 12, 15, 286, 533, 7954, 585, 28, 720, 327, 2, 175, 106, 2214, 62, 7, 73, 5, 240, 11, 447, 1455, 1345, 240, 4437, 137, 29, 4675, 6, 1375, 640, 1267, 1536, 17592, 15, 150, 36, 101, 4, 675, 3538, 14, 66, 39, 49, 2, 175, 83, 1, 240, 640, 4, 342, 12, 1214, 246, 12, 2, 106, 3, 119, 1, 240, 16, 6896, 252, 98, 4, 67, 1, 79, 815, 12, 1996, 8, 5039, 1, 26, 45, 16, 8, 174, 669, 10798, 1, 240, 119, 4, 3, 1605, 83, 609, 141, 3, 1612, 119, 1, 240]",1614.0,23273995,Historical trends use radiation therapy pediatric 1973-2008,28,0.2014388489208633
Clinicopathologic analysis of low-stage sporadic ovarian carcinomas: a reappraisal.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2013-03-01,"Current histologic criteria endorsed by World Health Organization for surface epithelial ovarian tumors suffer from less than optimal reproducibility and correlation with clinical outcomes. A modified approach for histologic subclassification of ovarian carcinomas (OCs), proposed by the group of Gilks and colleagues, has been shown to be reproducible and clinically meaningful. We hypothesized that this approach could be validated using a well-annotated, external cohort of OCs with detailed immunophenotypic, genotypic, and clinical data. The cohort comprised 91 patients with low-stage (FIGO stage I/II) OC who underwent primary surgical management at our institution from 1980 to 2000. The clinical and histologic features of this cohort were reported in 2004. In this study we rereviewed the hematoxylin and eosin slides and reassigned histologic type using the criteria proposed by Gilks and colleagues. p53 and Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) expressions were evaluated using standard immunohistochemical techniques on a tissue microarray. Absence of (null) or strong and diffuse p53 staining in >75% of tumor cells (overexpression) was interpreted as aberrant p53 expression, in contrast to the 2004 study in which the ""null"" result had been interpreted as negative. Direct TP53 gene sequencing of the entire coding region had been performed on all cases with available tissue. Relationships between survival and the following parameters were studied: tumor cell type, histologic grade, stage, p53 and WT1 expression, TP53 mutation, and presence of associated endometriosis. Results were compared with those of the 2004 study, at which time only TP53 mutation was shown to correlate with adverse survival; notably, TP53 mutation did not correlate with p53 expression by immunohistochemical analysis. After review, presence of TP53 mutations, WT1 positivity, and aberrant p53 expression were strongly associated with high-grade serous histology (P=0.0001). Modification of p53 staining assessment revealed strong correlations with TP53 mutation status, which was superior to the positive versus negative approach used previously (P=0.0005). Redefined histologic criteria revealed a stronger association between the high-grade serous type and WT1 positivity (P=0.02). Prolonged 10-year disease-specific and progression-free survival were associated with endometrioid histology (P<0.02; 94%±4% vs. 53%±7% and 96%±4% vs. 50%±7%, respectively). Inferior 10-year disease-specific survival and progression-free survival were associated with high histologic grade (vs. low and intermediate; P<0.01; 54%±7% vs. 89%±6% and 56%±7% vs. 89%±6%, respectively), presence of TP53 mutation (P<0.04; 54%±12% vs. 64%±10% and 34%±12% vs. 70%±6%, respectively), aberrant p53 expression (P<0.02; 35%±12% vs. 75%±7% and 36%±12% vs. 73%±7%, respectively), and absence of associated endometriosis (P=0.01; 48%±9% vs. 80%±6% and 51%±9% vs. 80%±6%, respectively). In addition, inferior 10-year PFS was associated with WT1 positivity (P=0.01; 42%±7% vs. 72%±7%) and high substage (IA-IB vs. IC-IIC; P=0.04; 53%±7% vs. 81%±8%).

Surg.,2013-01-01,"The prognosis for children with Wilms tumor (WT) has improved dramatically as the result of advances in surgical techniques, anesthesia, and supportive care. During the last three decades, the National Wilms Tumor Study Group (NWTSG), the International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP), and the United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group (UKCCSG) conducted sequential studies of treatments for children with WT. The National Wilms Study Group demonstrated that radiation therapy is not necessary for those with Stage I and II, favorable histology Wilms tumor, and that the dose necessary for local control for those with local Stage III disease is 1050 to 1080 cGy. Administration of actinomycin D and doxorubicin using a single dose rather than divided dose schedule produced less myelosuppression and equivalent outcomes. Loss of heterozygosity for chromosomes 1p and 16q was associated with an inferior outcome. Areas for future investigation include the role of whole lung irradiation in the treatment of those with pulmonary metastases, the use of parenchymal sparing surgical techniques for removal of Wilms tumors, and identification of minimal necessary therapy.",Lecture,2576.0,37.0,prognosis children Wilms WT improved dramatically advances surgical techniques anesthesia supportive care decades National Wilms Group NWTSG International Society Pediatric Oncology SIOP United Kingdom Children 's Group UKCCSG conducted sequential studies treatments children WT National Wilms Group demonstrated radiation therapy necessary Stage II favorable histology Wilms dose necessary local control local Stage III disease 1050 1080 cGy Administration actinomycin doxorubicin single dose divided dose schedule produced myelosuppression equivalent outcomes Loss heterozygosity chromosomes 1p 16q associated inferior outcome Areas future investigation include role lung irradiation treatment pulmonary metastases use parenchymal sparing surgical techniques removal Wilms identification minimal necessary therapy,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 356, 9, 541, 5, 30, 1820, 71, 231, 2729, 22, 3, 757, 1, 954, 4, 221, 1092, 6433, 2, 1877, 165, 190, 3, 1060, 169, 1968, 3, 657, 30, 45, 87, 20293, 3, 944, 1174, 1, 815, 413, 28737, 2, 3, 1088, 10782, 541, 292, 12, 45, 87, 62336, 426, 1787, 94, 1, 640, 9, 541, 5, 1820, 3, 657, 45, 87, 264, 17, 121, 36, 16, 44, 1493, 9, 135, 5, 82, 70, 2, 215, 913, 784, 30, 2, 17, 3, 61, 1493, 9, 293, 182, 9, 135, 5, 293, 82, 316, 34, 16, 24784, 6, 19711, 3071, 634, 1, 16226, 427, 2, 856, 75, 8, 226, 61, 1832, 76, 2176, 61, 1055, 1687, 299, 2858, 2, 2017, 123, 407, 1, 3963, 9, 3560, 4029, 2, 14410, 10, 41, 5, 35, 1663, 228, 1361, 9, 508, 940, 643, 3, 200, 1, 902, 1104, 4, 3, 24, 1, 135, 5, 1087, 196, 3, 119, 1, 5338, 1851, 221, 1092, 9, 2829, 1, 57, 2, 911, 1, 1048, 1493, 36]",1119.0,23331787,evolution treatment Wilms,8,0.05755395683453238
Clinicopathologic findings predictive of relapse in children with stage III favorable-histology Wilms tumor.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2013-02-04,"Stage III designation in NWTS-5 (National Wilms Tumor Study-5) was determined by four pathologic criteria: positive lymph nodes (LNs), peritoneal implants, residual disease, and tumor rupture. The objective of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of each of the stage III criteria. Children with stage III Wilms tumor (WT) treated in NWTS-5 were assessed for event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Sites of relapse and molecular status of tumors are reported. EFS and OS are reported 8 years after diagnosis. There were 569 patients with local stage III favorable-histology (FH) WT in this analysis, of whom 109 had overall stage IV disease. LN involvement alone was the most frequent criterion for stage III designation (38%), followed by microscopic residual disease alone (20%), microscopic residual disease and LN involvement (14%), and spill or soilage alone (9%). The 8-year EFS and OS estimates for all patients with local stage III FHWT were 82% and 91%, respectively. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that both LN involvement (relative risk, 1.89; P = .005) and microscopic residual disease (relative risk, 1.87; P = .007) were predictive of EFS, and OS results were similar. There was no apparent difference in pattern of relapse according to stage III subtype. The rate of loss of heterozygosity was higher (6%) for those with positive LNs than for those without (2%; P = .05). LN involvement and microscopic residual are the stage III criteria highly predictive of EFS and OS for patients with stage III FHWT.

Detection and preliminary characterization of CD8+T lymphocytes specific for Wilms' tumor antigen in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2013-04-30,"Wilms' tumor antigen (WT1) is overexpressed in many different solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. However, little is known about WT1 expression or WT1-specific immune responses in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In a cross-sectional survey study, we investigated the immune recognition of WT1 by patients with NHL. Utilizing a WT1 overlapping peptide library, we discovered that a large percentage of patients with NHL of all grades maintain WT1-specific T cells. Ex vivo frequencies of these T cells measured from unfractionated samples by the CD137 activation marker assay were high in many patients (some > 1% CD8+). Using standard in vitro techniques we discovered that they were cytotoxic to WT1 peptide library-loaded T2 cells and WT1 antigen-primed autologous Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell lines (EBV-LCLs) and expressed interferon gamma (IFN-γ). In addition, we detected WT1 mRNA transcripts in diseased lymph node tissues of patients with NHL utilizing real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) technology. These results are the first example of strong T cell reactivity against WT1 in patients with NHL which also demonstrate strong cytotoxicity against peptide-loaded tumor cells.

"Coordinate patterns of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Wilms tumor 1 expression in the histopathologic distinction of ovarian from endometrial serous adenocarcinomas.",Annals of diagnostic pathology,Ann Diagn Pathol,2013-05-21,"The purpose of this study is to assess whether composite or coordinate immunoexpression patterns of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) gene can significantly distinguish between endometrial serous carcinoma (ESC) and ovarian serous carcinoma (OSC). Immunohistochemical analyses were performed on whole tissue sections from 22 uterus-confined ESCs and on a tissue microarray of 140 high-grade, pan-stage OSCs, using antibodies to ER, PR, and WT-1. Estrogen receptor, PR, and WT1 expressions were present in 37%, 49%, and 81% of OSC, respectively, but these markers were also present in 18%, 27%, and 36% of ESC. The ER+/PR+/WT1+ coordinate profile was identified in 33.6% of OSC but in none of ESC (P = .0006), resulting in a calculated sensitivity and specificity of this profile for OSC of 33.6% and 100%, respectively. By contrast, the ER-/PR-/WT1- coordinate profile was identified in 41% of ESC but in only 6.4% of OSC (P = .0001), resulting in a calculated sensitivity and specificity of this profile for ESC of 50% and 94%. In summary, in the differential diagnosis between OSC and ESC, positivity for all 3 markers favors an extrauterine origin, whereas negativity for all 3 markers is supportive of an endometrial origin.

Pulmonary disease after treatment for Wilms tumor: a report from the national wilms tumor long-term follow-up study.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2013-06-14,"This study was undertaken to evaluate the incidence of pulmonary disease among patients treated with radiation therapy (RT) for pulmonary metastases (PM) from Wilms tumor (WT). We reviewed records of 6,449 patients treated on National Wilms Tumor Studies-1, -2, -3, and -4 whose flow sheets or annual status reports documented one of several pulmonary conditions. Cases were fully evaluable if pulmonary function test (PFT) results were available, pulmonary fibrosis was identified on a chest radiograph or was listed as the primary or a contributing factor to death. Partially evaluable cases were those for whom PFT results could not be obtained. We evaluated the relationship between RT factors and the occurrence of pulmonary disease using hazard ratios (HRs) and cumulative incidence, treating death as a competing risk. Sixty-four fully evaluable and 16 partially evaluable cases of pulmonary disease were identified. The cumulative incidence of pulmonary disease at 15 years since WT diagnosis was 4.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.6-5.4%) among fully evaluable and 4.8% (95% CI 3.3-6.4%) among fully and partially evaluable patients who received lung RT for PM at initial diagnosis. Rates of pulmonary disease were substantially higher among those who received lung RT for PM present at initial diagnosis or relapse compared to those who received no RT or only abdominal RT (HR 30.2, 95% CI 16.9-53.9).

Is adrenalectomy necessary during unilateral nephrectomy for Wilms Tumor? A report from the Children's Oncology Group.,Journal of pediatric surgery,J. Pediatr. Surg.,2013-07-01,"To determine whether performing adrenalectomy at the time of nephrectomy for unilateral Wilms tumor impacts clinical outcome. We reviewed information on all patients enrolled on National Wilms Tumor Study-4 and -5. Data were abstracted on patient demographics, tumor characteristics, surgical and pathologic status of the adrenal gland, and patient outcomes. The primary endpoints were intraoperative spill and five-year event-free survival (EFS) in patients who did or did not undergo adrenalectomy. Of 3825 patients with complete evaluable data, the adrenal was left in situ in 2264 (57.9%) patients, and was removed completely in 1367 patients (36.7%) or partially in 194 patients (5.2%). Of the adrenal glands removed, 68 (4.4%) contained tumor. Adrenal involvement was more common in patients with stage 3 (9.8%) than stage 2 disease (1.9%; p < 0.0001). After controlling for stage and histopathology, five-year EFS was similar whether or not the adrenal gland was removed (p = 0.48), or involved with tumor (p = 0.81); however, intraoperative spill rates were higher in patients undergoing adrenalectomy (26.1% vs 15.5%, p < 0.0001), likely due to larger tumor size or technical factors. No patient had clinical evidence of adrenal insufficiency or tumor recurrence in the adrenal gland during follow-up (median 9.9 years). Sparing the adrenal gland during nephrectomy for unilateral Wilms tumor was not associated with a higher incidence of intraoperative spill and was associated with a similar oncologic outcome, on a per-stage basis, with cases where the adrenal was removed. Thus, adrenalectomy should not be considered mandatory during radical nephrectomy for Wilms tumor.",Journal Article,2395.0,12.0,determine performing adrenalectomy time nephrectomy unilateral Wilms impacts clinical outcome reviewed information patients enrolled National Wilms Study-4 -5 abstracted patient demographics characteristics surgical pathologic status adrenal gland patient outcomes primary endpoints intraoperative spill five-year event-free survival EFS patients undergo adrenalectomy 3825 patients complete evaluable adrenal left situ 2264 57.9 patients removed completely 1367 patients 36.7 partially 194 patients 5.2 adrenal glands removed 68 4.4 contained Adrenal involvement common patients stage 3 9.8 stage 2 disease 1.9 p 0.0001 controlling stage histopathology five-year EFS similar adrenal gland removed p 0.48 involved p 0.81 intraoperative spill rates higher patients undergoing adrenalectomy 26.1 vs 15.5 p 0.0001 likely larger size technical factors patient clinical evidence adrenal insufficiency recurrence adrenal gland follow-up median 9.9 years Sparing adrenal gland nephrectomy unilateral Wilms associated higher incidence intraoperative spill associated similar oncologic outcome per-stage basis cases adrenal removed adrenalectomy considered mandatory radical nephrectomy Wilms,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 223, 317, 3620, 6647, 28, 3, 98, 1, 1738, 9, 3208, 30, 4719, 38, 228, 21, 446, 487, 23, 62, 7, 346, 23, 657, 30, 45, 39, 2, 33, 74, 11, 4106, 23, 69, 2221, 30, 374, 221, 2, 510, 156, 1, 3, 2987, 2326, 2, 69, 123, 3, 86, 1387, 11, 1720, 17480, 2, 365, 111, 774, 115, 25, 1683, 4, 7, 54, 205, 15, 205, 44, 1251, 6647, 1, 63151, 7, 5, 236, 859, 74, 3, 2987, 10, 1712, 4, 957, 4, 39067, 696, 83, 7, 2, 10, 2264, 2500, 4, 32151, 7, 511, 67, 15, 2995, 4, 5434, 7, 33, 18, 1, 3, 2987, 3966, 2264, 806, 39, 39, 3070, 30, 2987, 799, 10, 80, 186, 4, 7, 5, 82, 27, 83, 66, 76, 82, 18, 34, 14, 83, 19, 13, 488, 50, 1893, 9, 82, 2, 3831, 365, 111, 1683, 10, 288, 317, 15, 44, 3, 2987, 2326, 10, 2264, 19, 13, 576, 15, 646, 5, 30, 19, 13, 865, 137, 1720, 17480, 151, 11, 142, 4, 7, 479, 6647, 432, 14, 105, 167, 33, 19, 13, 488, 322, 520, 6, 1077, 30, 444, 15, 3359, 130, 77, 69, 42, 38, 241, 1, 2987, 4360, 15, 30, 146, 4, 3, 2987, 2326, 190, 166, 126, 52, 83, 83, 60, 1851, 3, 2987, 2326, 190, 1738, 9, 3208, 30, 10, 44, 41, 5, 8, 142, 287, 1, 1720, 17480, 2, 10, 41, 5, 8, 288, 1998, 228, 23, 8, 379, 82, 877, 5, 140, 1257, 3, 2987, 10, 2264, 631, 6647, 257, 44, 40, 515, 7322, 190, 711, 1738, 9, 30]",1595.0,23895979,adrenalectomy necessary unilateral nephrectomy Wilms report Children 's Oncology Group,5,0.03597122302158273
"Morphoproteomic profiling of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in desmoplastic small round cell tumor (EWS/WT1), Ewing's sarcoma (EWS/FLI1) and Wilms' tumor(WT1).",PloS one,PLoS ONE,2013-07-29,"Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is a rare sarcoma in adolescents and young adults. The hallmark of this disease is a EWS-WT1 translocation resulting from apposition of the Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) gene with the Wilms' tumor (WT1) gene. We performed morphoproteomic profiling of DSRCT (EWS-WT1), Ewing's sarcoma (EWS-FLI1) and Wilms' tumor (WT1) to better understand the signaling pathways for selecting future targeted therapies. This pilot study assessed patients with DSRCT, Wilms' tumor and Ewing's sarcoma. Morphoproteomics and immunohistochemical probes were applied to detect: p-mTOR (Ser2448); p-Akt (Ser473); p-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204); p-STAT3 (Tyr 705); and cell cycle-related analytes along with their negative controls. In DSRCT the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is constitutively activated by p-Akt (Ser 473) expression in the nuclear compartment of the tumor cells and p-mTOR phosphorylated on Ser 2448, suggesting mTORC2 (rictor+mTOR) as the dominant form. Ewing's sarcoma had upregulated p-Akt and p-mTOR, predominantly mTORC2. In Wilm's tumor, the mTOR pathway is also activated with most tumor cells moderately expressing p-mTOR (Ser 2448) in plasmalemmal and cytoplasmic compartments. This coincides with the constitutive activation of one of the downstream effectors of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, namely p-p70S6K (Thr 389). There was constitutive activation of the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway p-ERK 1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) expression in the Wilms tumor and metastatic Ewing's sarcoma, but not in the DSRCT. MORPHOPROTEOMIC TUMOR ANALYSES REVEALED CONSTITUTIVE ACTIVATION OF THE MTOR PATHWAY AS EVIDENCED BY: (a) expression of phosphorylated (p)-mTOR, p-p70S6K; (b) mTORC 2 in EWS and DSRCT; (c) ERK signaling was seen in the advanced setting indicating these as resistance pathways to IGF1R related therapies.

RFS and OS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using the Cox model and tested for statistical significance by the log-rank test. Four hundred ninety-nine patients were found after review to have Stage II, FH Wilms tumor. The 8-year RFS percentages were 85.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 81.1%, 88.1%) for those with no spill compared to 75.7% (65.8%, 83.2%) for those with spill. The 8-year OS percentages were 95.6% (93.1%, 97.3%) for those with no spill compared to 90.3% (82.2%, 94.9%) for those with spill. The HR for relapse among those with spill was 1.55 ((95%CI: 0.97,2.51), P = 0.067) and the HR for death was 1.94 ((0.92,4.09), P = 0.077).

The IGF2 intronic miR-483 selectively enhances transcription from IGF2 fetal promoters and enhances tumorigenesis.,Genes & development,Genes Dev.,2013-12-01,"Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), a developmentally regulated and maternally imprinted gene, is frequently overexpressed in pediatric cancers. Although loss of imprinting (LOI) at fetal promoters contributes to increased IGF2 in tumors, the magnitude of IGF2 expression suggests the involvement of additional regulatory mechanisms. A microRNA (miRNA) screen of primary Wilms' tumors identified specific overexpression of miR-483-5p, which is embedded within the IGF2 gene. Unexpectedly, the IGF2 mRNA itself is transcriptionally up-regulated by miR-483-5p. A nuclear pool of miR-483-5p binds directly to the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of fetal IGF2 mRNA, enhancing the association of the RNA helicase DHX9 to the IGF2 transcript and promoting IGF2 transcription. Ectopic expression of miR-483-5p in IGF2-dependent sarcoma cells is correlated with increased tumorigenesis in vivo.

Mutations in p53 and BRCA1 genes play a key role in ovarian serous carcinogenesis. We investigated whether the loss of BRCA1 expression plays a similar role in uterine serous carcinoma. Loss of BRCA1 expression and Wilms tumor 1 (WT-1) overexpression were detected by immunohistochemical analysis. Depth of myometrial invasion, the presence of precursor lesions or polyps, and clinical parameters (age, history of breast cancer, and germline BRCA1 mutation status) were recorded. A total of 27 cases were available for evaluation. Three tumors (11.1%, 95% confidence interval, 2%-29%) showed the loss of BRCA1 expression. Two of these had known germline mutation in BRCA1, and the third had not been analyzed. Two of these cases expressed WT-1 or showed some morphologic features suggestive of drop metastasis from the adnexa, but no case showed detectable serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma or features of an ovarian primary tumor. Overall, 5 women in the group had a personal history of breast cancer, and the finding was significantly associated with BRCA1 staining (P=0.049).

Therapeutic efficacy of an Fc-enhanced TCR-like antibody to the intracellular WT1 oncoprotein.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2014-05-21,"RMFPNAPYL (RMF), a Wilms' tumor gene 1 (WT1)-derived CD8 T-cell epitope presented by HLA-A*02:01, is a validated target for T-cell-based immunotherapy. We previously reported ESK1, a high avidity (Kd < 0.2 nmol/L), fully-human monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for the WT1 RMF peptide/HLA-A*02:01 complex, which selectively bound and killed WT1(+) and HLA-A*02:01(+) leukemia and solid tumor cell lines. We engineered a second-generation mAb, ESKM, to have enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) function due to altered Fc glycosylation. ESKM was compared with native ESK1 in binding assays, in vitro ADCC assays, and mesothelioma and leukemia therapeutic models and pharmacokinetic studies in mice. ESKM toxicity was assessed in HLA-A*02:01(+) transgenic mice. ESK antibodies mediated ADCC against hematopoietic and solid tumor cells at concentrations below 1 μg/mL, but ESKM was about 5- to 10-fold more potent in vitro against multiple cancer cell lines. ESKM was more potent in vivo against JMN mesothelioma, and effective against SET2 AML and fresh ALL xenografts. ESKM had a shortened half-life (4.9 days vs. 6.5 days), but an identical biodistribution pattern in C57BL/6J mice.

Experience with retroperitoneal partial nephrectomy in bilateral Wilms tumor.,European journal of pediatric surgery : official journal of Austrian Association of Pediatric Surgery ... [et al] = Zeitschrift fur Kinderchirurgie,Eur J Pediatr Surg,2014-09-02,"Retroperitoneal partial nephrectomy has not been studied as a surgical approach for children with bilateral Wilms tumor. There are advantages to this technique, including isolation of urine leaks to the retroperitoneum, decreased risk of bowel injury, and decreased time to resuming a diet. Presently, all bilateral Wilms tumors are treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and attempted nephron-sparing surgery. In this study, we compare the outcomes of the retroperitoneal and transabdominal approaches in doing partial nephrectomy for bilateral Wilms tumor. With the institutional review board approval, we reviewed records of 14 pediatric patients with metachronous or synchronous bilateral Wilms tumors who underwent surgery after chemotherapy between 1994 and 2014. Only operative procedures with the intent to cure were included (n=15) and of these, 5 procedures were retroperitoneal and 10 were transabdominal in approach. Individual kidneys operated upon (n=26) were analyzed using the preoperative radius exophytic/endophytic nearness anterior/posterior location nephrometry score to ensure that resected tumors were comparable between the two surgical groups. Charts were retrospectively analyzed for intraoperative parameters and postoperative course. Differences between parameters were evaluated using Mann-Whitney and chi-square tests. Resected tumors in both surgical treatment groups had comparable sizes, nephrometry scores, and rates of anaplasia. Operative time, blood loss, and transfusion requirement were similar between the two groups. The extent of lymph node sampling and rates of R0 resection were equivalent. One adverse intraoperative event, a bowel enterotomy, was seen in the transabdominal group. Patients after retroperitoneal partial nephrectomy required half the time to return to an oral diet as compared with those after a transabdominal surgery, approaching statistical significance (p=0.08). Rates of the postoperative urine leak were similar, though two in the transabdominal group required reoperation for drainage. There were four recurrences, all in the transabdominal group. Our experience demonstrates that the retroperitoneal approach is equivalent to the transabdominal technique with regards to intraoperative complications, lymph node dissection, and R0 resection. Advantages include less time to resumption of oral feeding, decreased risk of bowel injury, and isolation of urine leaks to the retroperitoneum. It should be considered a viable surgical option in the treatment of bilateral Wilms tumors.",Comparative Study,1967.0,5.0,Retroperitoneal partial nephrectomy studied surgical approach children bilateral Wilms advantages technique including isolation urine leaks retroperitoneum decreased risk bowel injury decreased time resuming diet Presently bilateral Wilms treated neoadjuvant chemotherapy attempted nephron-sparing surgery compare outcomes retroperitoneal transabdominal approaches partial nephrectomy bilateral Wilms institutional review board approval reviewed records 14 pediatric patients metachronous synchronous bilateral Wilms underwent surgery chemotherapy 1994 2014 operative procedures intent cure included n=15 5 procedures retroperitoneal 10 transabdominal approach Individual kidneys operated n=26 preoperative radius exophytic/endophytic nearness anterior/posterior location nephrometry score ensure resected comparable surgical groups Charts retrospectively intraoperative parameters postoperative course Differences parameters evaluated Mann-Whitney chi-square tests Resected surgical treatment groups comparable sizes nephrometry scores rates anaplasia Operative time blood loss transfusion requirement similar groups extent lymph node sampling rates R0 resection equivalent adverse intraoperative event bowel enterotomy seen transabdominal group Patients retroperitoneal partial nephrectomy required half time return oral diet compared transabdominal surgery approaching statistical significance p=0.08 Rates postoperative urine leak similar transabdominal group required reoperation drainage recurrences transabdominal group experience demonstrates retroperitoneal approach equivalent transabdominal technique regards intraoperative complications lymph node dissection R0 resection Advantages include time resumption oral feeding decreased risk bowel injury isolation urine leaks retroperitoneum considered viable surgical option treatment bilateral Wilms,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2591, 450, 1738, 71, 44, 85, 656, 22, 8, 221, 353, 9, 541, 5, 1607, 30, 125, 32, 3126, 6, 26, 1312, 141, 5019, 1, 2646, 9674, 6, 3, 7765, 340, 43, 1, 1659, 2730, 2, 340, 98, 6, 34606, 8, 2453, 9083, 62, 1607, 57, 32, 73, 5, 536, 56, 2, 4098, 10995, 1851, 152, 4, 26, 45, 21, 932, 3, 123, 1, 3, 2591, 2, 16333, 611, 4, 9647, 450, 1738, 9, 1607, 30, 5, 3, 1115, 206, 2620, 1814, 21, 446, 1064, 1, 213, 815, 7, 5, 4796, 15, 2734, 1607, 57, 54, 208, 152, 50, 56, 59, 3023, 2, 1409, 158, 1208, 1369, 5, 3, 1697, 6, 1722, 11, 159, 78, 167, 2, 1, 46, 33, 1369, 11, 2591, 2, 79, 11, 16333, 4, 353, 797, 7143, 7297, 1548, 78, 432, 11, 311, 75, 3, 498, 15862, 12975, 28693, 27148, 2882, 3028, 1147, 12673, 368, 6, 3478, 17, 1133, 57, 11, 1279, 59, 3, 100, 221, 271, 4413, 11, 894, 311, 9, 1720, 1038, 2, 573, 906, 362, 59, 1038, 11, 194, 75, 7470, 7471, 2, 3163, 3219, 895, 1133, 57, 4, 110, 221, 24, 271, 42, 1279, 4131, 12673, 703, 2, 151, 1, 13547, 1208, 98, 315, 407, 2, 2785, 4701, 11, 288, 59, 3, 100, 271, 3, 1039, 1, 263, 289, 2874, 2, 151, 1, 2328, 170, 11, 2017, 104, 290, 1720, 774, 8, 1659, 39727, 10, 527, 4, 3, 16333, 87, 7, 50, 2591, 450, 1738, 616, 1303, 3, 98, 6, 4656, 6, 35, 518, 2453, 22, 72, 5, 135, 50, 8, 16333, 152, 7773, 1050, 724, 19, 13, 1592, 151, 1, 3, 573, 2646, 4238, 11, 288, 2471, 100, 4, 3, 16333, 87, 616, 5077, 9, 3528, 125, 11, 294, 1593, 62, 4, 3, 16333, 87, 114, 730, 1902, 17, 3, 2591, 353, 16, 2017, 6, 3, 16333, 1312, 5, 8930, 6, 1720, 521, 263, 289, 1161, 2, 2328, 170, 3126, 643, 299, 98, 6, 14268, 1, 518, 5595, 340, 43, 1, 1659, 2730, 2, 5019, 1, 2646, 9674, 6, 3, 7765, 192, 257, 40, 515, 8, 2663, 221, 1501, 4, 3, 24, 1, 1607, 57]",2473.0,25181295,Experience retroperitoneal partial nephrectomy bilateral Wilms,0,0.0
Individual prediction of heart failure among childhood cancer survivors.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2014-10-06,"To create clinically useful models that incorporate readily available demographic and cancer treatment characteristics to predict individual risk of heart failure among 5-year survivors of childhood cancer. Survivors in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) free of significant cardiovascular disease 5 years after cancer diagnosis (n = 13,060) were observed through age 40 years for the development of heart failure (ie, requiring medications or heart transplantation or leading to death). Siblings (n = 4,023) established the baseline population risk. An additional 3,421 survivors from Emma Children's Hospital (Amsterdam, the Netherlands), the National Wilms Tumor Study, and the St Jude Lifetime Cohort Study were used to validate the CCSS prediction models. Heart failure occurred in 285 CCSS participants. Risk scores based on selected exposures (sex, age at cancer diagnosis, and anthracycline and chest radiotherapy doses) achieved an area under the curve of 0.74 and concordance statistic of 0.76 at or through age 40 years. Validation cohort estimates ranged from 0.68 to 0.82. Risk scores were collapsed to form statistically distinct low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups, corresponding to cumulative incidences of heart failure at age 40 years of 0.5% (95% CI, 0.2% to 0.8%), 2.4% (95% CI, 1.8% to 3.0%), and 11.7% (95% CI, 8.8% to 14.5%), respectively. In comparison, siblings had a cumulative incidence of 0.3% (95% CI, 0.1% to 0.5%).

Phase I trial of Seneca Valley Virus (NTX-010) in children with relapsed/refractory solid tumors: a report of the Children's Oncology Group.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2014-10-12,"To determine the MTD of Seneca Valley Virus (NTX-010) in children with relapsed/refractory solid tumors. Patients (≥ 3-≤ 21 years) with neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, or rare tumors with neuroendocrine features were eligible. Part A (single dose of NTX-010) enrolled 13 patients at three dose levels (1 × 10(9) viral particles (vp)/kg [n = 6], 1 × 10(10) vp/kg [n = 3], 1 × 10(11) vp/kg [n = 4]). Diagnoses included neuroblastoma (n = 9), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 2), carcinoid tumor (n = 1), and adrenocorticocarcinoma (n = 1). Part B added cyclophosphamide (CTX) (oral CTX (25 mg/m(2) /day) days 1-14 and IV CTX (750 mg/m(2) ) days 8 and 29) to two doses of NTX-010 (1 × 10(11) vp/kg, days 8 and 29). Nine patients enrolled to Part B. Diagnoses included neuroblastoma (n = 3), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 1), Wilms tumor (n = 3), and adrenocorticocarcinoma (n = 2). Twelve patients on Part A were evaluable for toxicity. There was a single DLT (grade 3 pain) at dose level 1. Additional grade ≥ 3 related adverse events (AEs) included leukopenia (n = 1), neutropenia (n = 3), lymphopenia (n = 3), and tumor pain (n = 1). No DLTs occurred on part B. Other grade ≥ 3 related AEs on Part B included: Leukopenia (n = 3), nausea (n = 1), emesis (n = 1), anemia (n = 1), neutropenia (n = 4), platelets (n = 1), alanine aminotransferase (n = 1), and lymphopenia (n = 2).

Breast cancer in female survivors of Wilms tumor: a report from the national Wilms tumor late effects study.,Cancer,Cancer,2014-10-27,"The standard treatment of pulmonary metastases in patients with Wilms tumor (WT) includes 12-gray radiotherapy (RT) to the entire chest. To the authors' knowledge, the risk of breast cancer (BC) in a large cohort of female survivors of WT has not previously been reported. A total of 2492 female participants in National Wilms Tumor Studies 1 through 4 (1969-1995) were followed from age 15 years through the middle of 2013 for incident BC. The median age at the time of last contact was 27.3 years. The authors calculated cumulative risk at age 40 years (CR40), hazard ratios (HR) by Cox regression, standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) relative to US population rates, and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). The numbers of survivors with invasive BC divided by the numbers at risk were 16 of 369 (CR40, 14.8% [95% CI, 8.7-24.5]) for women who received chest RT for metastatic WT, 10 of 894 (CR40, 3.1% [95% CI, 1.3-7.41]) for those who received only abdominal RT, and 2 of 1229 (CR40, 0.3% [95% CI, 0.0-2.3]) for those who received no RT. The SIRs for these 3 groups were 27.6 (95% CI, 16.1-44.2) based on 5010 person-years (PY) of follow-up, 6.0 (95% CI, 2.9-11.0) based on 13,185 PY of follow-up, and 2.2 (95% CI, 0.3-7.8) based on 13,560 PY of follow-up, respectively. The risk was high regardless of the use of chest RT among women diagnosed with WT at age ≥10 years, with 9 of 90 women developing BC (CR40, 13.5% [95% CI, 5.6-30.6]; SIR, 23.6 [95% CI, 10.8-44.8] [PY, 1463]). Female survivors of WT who were treated with chest RT had a high risk of developing early BC, with nearly 15% developing invasive disease by age 40 years.

WT1 vaccination in AML and MDS: A pilot trial with synthetic analog peptides.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2015-05-03,"Peptide vaccines are capable of eliciting immune responses targeting tumor-associated antigens such as the Wilms' Tumor 1 (WT1) antigen, often overexpressed in myeloid malignancies. Here, we assessed the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a polyvalent WT1 peptide vaccine. Individuals with WT1-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first (CR1) or second (CR2) remission or with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) following at least 1 prior line of therapy were vaccinated with a mixture of peptides derived from the WT1 protein, with sargramostim injections before vaccination to amplify immunogenicity. Six vaccinations were delivered biweekly, continuing then monthly until patients received 12 vaccinations or showed disease relapse or progression. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated by progression-free and overall survival. Immune responses were evaluated by delayed-type hypersensitivity testing and T-cell IFNγ ELISPOT at specified intervals. In 16 patients who received at least one vaccination, 10 completed the planned course of six vaccinations and six continued for up to six additional monthly vaccinations. Vaccinations were well tolerated, with no patients discontinuing due to toxicity. One of two patients with high-risk MDS experienced a prolonged decrease in transfusion dependence. Two of 14 AML patients demonstrated relapse-free survival >1 year. Both patients were in CR2 at time of vaccination, with duration of their remission exceeding duration of their first remission, suggesting a potential benefit. Our WT1 vaccine was well-tolerated. The clinical benefit that we observed in several patients suggests engagement of a protective immune response, indicating a need for further trials.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",1724.0,25.0,Peptide vaccines capable eliciting immune responses targeting tumor-associated antigens Wilms 1 WT1 antigen overexpressed myeloid malignancies assessed safety tolerability immunogenicity polyvalent WT1 peptide vaccine Individuals WT1-positive acute myeloid leukemia AML CR1 second CR2 remission higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome MDS following 1 prior line therapy vaccinated mixture peptides derived WT1 sargramostim injections vaccination amplify immunogenicity vaccinations delivered biweekly continuing monthly patients received 12 vaccinations showed disease relapse progression Therapeutic efficacy evaluated progression-free overall survival Immune responses evaluated delayed-type hypersensitivity testing T-cell IFNγ ELISPOT specified intervals 16 patients received vaccination 10 completed planned course vaccinations continued additional monthly vaccinations Vaccinations tolerated patients discontinuing toxicity patients high-risk MDS experienced prolonged decrease transfusion dependence 14 AML patients demonstrated relapse-free survival 1 year patients CR2 time vaccination duration remission exceeding duration remission suggesting potential benefit WT1 vaccine well-tolerated clinical benefit observed patients suggests engagement protective immune response indicating need trials,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1389, 1842, 32, 2787, 1, 10299, 250, 253, 529, 30, 41, 1575, 225, 22, 3, 30, 14, 3722, 448, 629, 1711, 4, 533, 441, 467, 21, 275, 3, 367, 1543, 2, 4050, 1, 8, 23304, 3722, 1389, 1274, 869, 5, 3722, 109, 286, 533, 329, 4, 157, 4516, 15, 419, 7865, 734, 15, 5, 142, 43, 681, 1223, 366, 28, 506, 14, 324, 328, 1, 36, 11, 5130, 5, 8, 6972, 1, 2491, 526, 29, 3, 3722, 178, 5, 15821, 4344, 348, 1915, 6, 13868, 4050, 437, 7318, 11, 1623, 7551, 4346, 818, 3889, 1100, 7, 103, 133, 7318, 15, 224, 34, 429, 15, 91, 189, 209, 10, 194, 20, 91, 115, 2, 63, 25, 250, 253, 11, 194, 20, 1612, 267, 4034, 471, 2, 102, 31, 6062, 7662, 28, 3575, 1582, 4, 245, 7, 54, 103, 28, 506, 104, 1915, 79, 781, 3, 1465, 906, 1, 437, 7318, 2, 437, 1351, 9, 126, 6, 437, 402, 3889, 7318, 7318, 11, 149, 421, 5, 77, 7, 7971, 520, 6, 155, 104, 1, 100, 7, 5, 64, 43, 1223, 592, 8, 1069, 775, 4, 2785, 3721, 100, 1, 213, 329, 7, 264, 429, 115, 25, 14, 111, 110, 7, 11, 4, 7865, 28, 98, 1, 1915, 5, 654, 1, 136, 734, 5178, 654, 1, 136, 157, 734, 802, 8, 174, 247, 114, 3722, 1274, 10, 149, 421, 3, 38, 247, 17, 21, 164, 4, 392, 7, 844, 5103, 1, 8, 2864, 250, 51, 1716, 8, 594, 9, 195, 143]",1666.0,25802083,WT1 vaccination AML MDS pilot trial synthetic analog peptides,2,0.014388489208633094
"Second malignant neoplasms among children, adolescents and young adults with Wilms tumor.",Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2015-03-25,"The goal of this study was to describe the incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMN) in survivors of Wilms tumor. Patients who were 0-20 years of age at time of primary diagnosis with Wilms tumor and reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results [SEER] program between 1973 and 2011 were eligible for inclusion in the cohort. We used competing risks methods to estimate the cumulative incidence of SMNs and assess contributing factors for developing SMN. We estimated standardized incidence ratios (SIR), absolute excess risk and overall survival after SMN using standard methods. Within the SEER database, 2,851 patients were diagnosed with Wilms tumor as their first malignancy. Of these, 34 patients were reported to have a SMN. Cumulative incidence of for a secondary malignancy was 0.6% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.3-1.0%) at 10 years, 1.6% (95% CI 1.0-2.3%) at 20 years, and 3.8% (95% CI 2.4-5.9%) at 30 years.

Renal function in survivors of nonsyndromic Wilms tumor treated with unilateral radical nephrectomy.,Cancer,Cancer,2015-04-01,"Partial nephrectomy is considered by some for children with unilateral Wilms tumor (UWT) to avoid the theoretical complication of renal insufficiency. In the current study, the authors evaluated the prevalence of hypertension and impaired renal function in long-term survivors of nonsyndromic UWT who were treated without nephrotoxic chemotherapy or ionizing radiation. Eligibility included age ≤15 years at the time of diagnosis of nonsyndromic UWT, treatment receipt before 2002, and maintenance of disease remission after unilateral nephrectomy without receipt of abdominal irradiation or nephrotoxic chemotherapy. Renal function was assessed by urinalysis and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Patients receiving antihypertensive medication or those with blood pressure readings of >140/90 mm Hg were considered to be hypertensive. A total of 75 patients with a median age at diagnosis of 3.2 years (range, 0.2-12.1 years) met eligibility criteria. The median length of follow-up was 19.6 years (range, 10.0-32.8 years). All but 1 patient had stage I/II disease. Sixty-eight patients (90.7%) patients had WT with favorable histology and 7 patients had anaplastic histology. Sixteen patients (21.3%) had an eGFR <90 mL/minute/1.73m(2), 2 of whom also had proteinuria (12.5%). No patient had an eGFR <60 mL/minute/1.73m(2). Five patients (6.7%) had hypertension, 3 of whom were receiving antihypertensive medications. At the time of last follow-up, no patient had developed end-stage renal disease. Patients with UWT who were treated with unilateral radical nephrectomy without nephrotoxic chemotherapy or ionizing radiation appear to be at low risk of developing significant long-term renal dysfunction. For this patient population, the routine use of partial nephrectomy does not appear justified. However, monitoring and counseling are important for identifying the rare patient who develops subtle renal insufficiency and therefore might be at an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular sequelae.",Journal Article,1756.0,19.0,Partial nephrectomy considered children unilateral Wilms UWT avoid theoretical complication renal insufficiency current authors evaluated prevalence hypertension impaired renal function long-term survivors nonsyndromic UWT treated nephrotoxic chemotherapy ionizing radiation Eligibility included age ≤15 years time diagnosis nonsyndromic UWT treatment receipt 2002 maintenance disease remission unilateral nephrectomy receipt abdominal irradiation nephrotoxic chemotherapy Renal function assessed urinalysis estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR Patients receiving antihypertensive medication blood pressure readings 140/90 mm Hg considered hypertensive total 75 patients median age diagnosis 3.2 years range 0.2-12.1 years met eligibility criteria median length follow-up 19.6 years range 10.0-32.8 years 1 patient stage I/II disease Sixty-eight patients 90.7 patients WT favorable histology 7 patients anaplastic histology Sixteen patients 21.3 eGFR 90 mL/minute/1.73m 2 2 proteinuria 12.5 patient eGFR 60 mL/minute/1.73m 2 patients 6.7 hypertension 3 receiving antihypertensive medications time follow-up patient developed end-stage renal disease Patients UWT treated unilateral radical nephrectomy nephrotoxic chemotherapy ionizing radiation appear low risk developing significant long-term renal dysfunction patient population routine use partial nephrectomy appear justified monitoring counseling important identifying rare patient develops subtle renal insufficiency increased risk adverse cardiovascular sequelae,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[450, 1738, 16, 515, 20, 476, 9, 541, 5, 3208, 30, 35993, 6, 3085, 3, 7060, 1447, 1, 4360, 4, 3, 291, 45, 3, 738, 194, 3, 1078, 1, 1824, 2, 2364, 343, 4, 319, 337, 332, 1, 19619, 35993, 54, 11, 73, 187, 16733, 56, 15, 4341, 121, 2317, 159, 89, 23984, 60, 28, 3, 98, 1, 147, 1, 19619, 35993, 24, 1699, 348, 1544, 2, 1146, 1, 34, 734, 50, 3208, 1738, 187, 1699, 1, 1467, 1104, 15, 16733, 56, 343, 10, 275, 20, 24923, 2, 661, 6080, 5779, 116, 227, 7, 357, 15977, 3012, 15, 135, 5, 315, 3738, 12816, 1, 3304, 424, 321, 4876, 11, 515, 6, 40, 14919, 8, 181, 1, 481, 7, 5, 8, 52, 89, 28, 147, 1, 27, 18, 60, 184, 13, 18, 133, 14, 60, 543, 2317, 371, 3, 52, 1318, 1, 166, 126, 10, 326, 49, 60, 184, 79, 13, 531, 66, 60, 62, 84, 14, 69, 42, 82, 70, 215, 34, 1746, 659, 7, 424, 67, 7, 42, 1820, 5, 913, 784, 2, 67, 7, 42, 1841, 784, 3228, 7, 239, 27, 42, 35, 227, 424, 542, 3949, 14, 25686, 18, 18, 1, 953, 120, 42, 5381, 133, 33, 77, 69, 42, 35, 227, 335, 542, 3949, 14, 25686, 18, 365, 7, 49, 67, 42, 1824, 27, 1, 953, 11, 357, 15977, 2679, 28, 3, 98, 1, 1060, 166, 126, 77, 69, 42, 276, 396, 82, 34, 7, 5, 35993, 54, 11, 73, 5, 3208, 711, 1738, 187, 16733, 56, 15, 4341, 121, 1322, 6, 40, 28, 154, 43, 1, 931, 93, 319, 337, 1527, 9, 26, 69, 266, 3, 1311, 119, 1, 450, 1738, 1097, 44, 1322, 6860, 137, 1315, 2, 2011, 32, 305, 9, 1386, 3, 622, 69, 54, 4734, 7543, 4360, 2, 673, 822, 40, 28, 35, 101, 43, 1, 290, 2179, 4156]",1921.0,25832759,Renal function survivors nonsyndromic Wilms treated unilateral radical nephrectomy,0,0.0
The WTX Tumor Suppressor Interacts with the Transcriptional Corepressor TRIM28.,The Journal of biological chemistry,J. Biol. Chem.,2015-04-16,"WTX encodes a tumor suppressor implicated in the pediatric kidney cancer Wilms tumor and in mesenchymal differentiation with potentially distinct functions in the cytoplasm, at the plasma membrane, and in the nucleus. Although modulating components of the WNT signaling pathway is a proposed function for cytoplasmic and membrane-bound WTX, its nuclear properties are not well understood. Here we report that the transcriptional corepressor TRIM28 is the major binding partner for nuclear WTX. WTX interacted with the coiled coil domain of TRIM28 required for its binding to Krüppel-associated box domains of transcription factors and for its chromatin recruitment through its own coiled coil and proline-rich domains. Knockdown of endogenous WTX reduced the recruitment of TRIM28 to a chromatinized reporter sequence and its ability to repress a target transcript. In mouse embryonic stem cells where TRIM28 plays a major role in repressing endogenous retroviruses and long interspersed elements, knockdown of either TRIM28 or WTX combined with single molecule RNA sequencing revealed a highly significant shared set of differentially regulated transcripts, including derepression of non-coding repetitive sequences and their neighboring protein encoding genes (p < 1e-20). In mesenchymal precursor cells, depletion of WTX and TRIM28 resulted in analogous β-catenin-independent defects in adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation, and knockdown of WTX reduced TRIM28 binding to Pparγ promoter. Together, the physical and functional interaction between WTX and TRIM28 suggests that the nuclear fraction of WTX plays a role in epigenetic silencing, an effect that may contribute to its function as a regulator of cellular differentiation and tumorigenesis.

Equivalence Ratio for Daunorubicin to Doxorubicin in Relation to Late Heart Failure in Survivors of Childhood Cancer.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2015-08-24,"Cumulative anthracycline dose is one of the strongest predictors of heart failure (HF) after cancer treatment. However, the differential risk for cardiotoxicity between daunorubicin and doxorubicin has not been rigorously evaluated among survivors of childhood cancer. These risks, which are based on hematologic toxicity, are currently assumed to be approximately equivalent. Data from 15,815 survivors of childhood cancer who survived at least 5 years were used. Survivors were from the Emma Children's Hospital/Academic Medical Center (n = 1,349), the National Wilms Tumor Study (n = 364), the St Jude Lifetime Cohort Study (n = 1,695), and the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (n = 12,407). The hazard ratio (HR) for clinical HF through age 40 years for doses of daunorubicin and doxorubicin (per 100-mg/m(2) increments) was estimated by using Cox regression adjusted for sex, age at diagnosis, treatment with other anthracycline agents and chest radiation, and cohort membership. In total, 5,144 (32.5%) patients received doxorubicin as part of their cancer treatment, whereas 2,243 (14.7%) received daunorubicin. On the basis of 271 occurrences of HF during a median follow-up time after cohort entry of 17.3 years (range, 0.0 to 35.0 years), the cumulative incidence of HF at age 40 years was 3.2% (95% CI, 2.8% to 3.7%). The average ratio of HRs for daunorubicin to doxorubicin was 0.45 (95% CI, 0.23 to 0.73). A similar ratio was obtained by using a linear dose-response model, which yielded an HR of 0.49 (95% CI, 0.28 to 0.70). Compared with doxorubicin, daunorubicin was less cardiotoxic among survivors of childhood cancer than most current guidelines suggest. This may have implications for follow-up guidelines.

Overall Survival and Renal Function of Patients With Synchronous Bilateral Wilms Tumor Undergoing Surgery at a Single Institution.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2015-10-01,"Wilms tumor is the most common renal cancer in children. Approximately 5% of children with Wilms tumor present with disease in both kidneys. The treatment challenge is to achieve a high cure rate while maintaining long-term renal function. We retrospectively reviewed our institutional experience with nephron sparing surgery (NSS) in patients with synchronous bilateral Wilms tumor (BWT) operated on between 2001 and 2014. Imaging studies, surgical approach, adjuvant therapy, and pathology reports were reviewed. Outcomes evaluated included surgical complications, tumor recurrence, patient survival, and renal function, as assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate. A total of 42 patients with BWT were identified: 39 (92.9%) patients underwent bilateral NSS; only 3 patients (7.1%) underwent unilateral nephrectomy with contralateral NSS. Postoperative complications included prolonged urine leak (10), infection (6), intussusception (2), and transient renal insufficiency (1). Three patients required early (within 4 months) repeat of NSS for residual tumor. In the long-term, 7 (16.7%) patients had local tumor recurrence (managed with repeat NSS in 6 and completion nephrectomy in 1) and 3 had an episode of intestinal obstruction requiring surgical intervention. Overall survival was 85.7% (mean follow-up, 4.1 years). Of the 6 patients who died, 5 had diffuse anaplastic histology. All of the patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate more than 60 mL/min/1.73 m at the last follow-up; no patient developed end-stage renal disease. In patients with synchronous, BWT, bilateral NSS is safe and almost always feasible, thereby preserving maximal renal parenchyma.

Reduction in Late Mortality among 5-Year Survivors of Childhood Cancer.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2016-01-13,"Among patients in whom childhood cancer was diagnosed in the 1970s and 1980s, 18% of those who survived for 5 years died within the subsequent 25 years. In recent decades, cancer treatments have been modified with the goal of reducing life-threatening late effects. We evaluated late mortality among 34,033 patients in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort who survived at least 5 years after childhood cancer (i.e., cancer diagnosed before the age of 21 years) for which treatment was initiated during the period from 1970 through 1999. The median follow-up was 21 years (range, 5 to 38). We evaluated demographic and disease factors that were associated with death from health-related causes (i.e., conditions that exclude recurrence or progression of the original cancer and external causes but include the late effects of cancer therapy) using cumulative incidence and piecewise exponential models to estimate relative rates and 95% confidence intervals. Of the 3958 deaths that occurred during the study period, 1618 (41%) were attributable to health-related causes, including 746 deaths from subsequent neoplasms, 241 from cardiac causes, 137 from pulmonary causes, and 494 from other causes. A reduction in 15-year mortality was observed for death from any cause (from 12.4% in the early 1970s to 6.0% in the 1990s, P<0.001 for trend) and from health-related causes (from 3.5% to 2.1%, P<0.001 for trend). These reductions were attributable to decreases in the rates of death from subsequent neoplasm (P<0.001), cardiac causes (P<0.001), and pulmonary causes (P=0.04). Changes in therapy according to decade included reduced rates of cranial radiotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (85% in the 1970s, 51% in the 1980s, and 19% in the 1990s), of abdominal radiotherapy for Wilms' tumor (78%, 53%, and 43%, respectively), of chest radiotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma (87%, 79%, and 61%, respectively), and of anthracycline exposure. Reduction in treatment exposure was associated with reduced late mortality among survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Wilms' tumor. The strategy of lowering therapeutic exposure has contributed to an observed decline in late mortality among 5-year survivors of childhood cancer.

Comprehensive renal function evaluation in patients treated for synchronous bilateral Wilms tumor.,Journal of pediatric surgery,J. Pediatr. Surg.,2016-10-27,"The purpose of this study was to perform a comprehensive assessment of long-term renal function in patients treated at our institution for synchronous bilateral Wilms tumor (BWT) and to determine the optimal method for estimating glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Surgical approach, adjuvant therapy, and pathology reports were reviewed for patients with at least six months follow-up from definitive surgery. eGFRs, as assessed by the Schwartz and Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) formulas, were compared to measured GFR (mGFR) determined by <sup>99m</sup>Tc-DTPA scanning. Urine studies, including microalbumin, β-microglobulin, and FE<sub>Na</sub> were also reviewed. Forty-two patients were identified. Of 36 living patients, 28 (77.8%) had greater than 6months follow-up, with a median overall follow-up of 5.2years (range: 1.4-13.4). The median mGFR was 97mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, while the median eGFR<sub>Schwartz</sub> and eGFR<sub>CKiD</sub> were 103.3mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> and 79.7mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, respectively, (p=0.13 and p=0.75, compared to mGFR). Eleven (39.3%) patients had at least one abnormal urine study (microalbumin >30μg/g creatinine, n=3; β-2 microglobulin >133μg/g creatinine, n=9; FE<sub>Na</sub>>1%, n=4).

A phase I study of single-agent perifosine for recurrent or refractory pediatric CNS and solid tumors.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2017-06-05,"The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is aberrantly activated in various pediatric tumors. We conducted a phase I study of the Akt inhibitor perifosine in patients with recurrent/refractory pediatric CNS and solid tumors. This was a standard 3+3 open-label dose-escalation study to assess pharmacokinetics, describe toxicities, and identify the MTD for single-agent perifosine. Five dose levels were investigated, ranging from 25 to 125 mg/m2/day for 28 days per cycle. Twenty-three patients (median age 10 years, range 4-18 years) with CNS tumors (DIPG [n = 3], high-grade glioma [n = 5], medulloblastoma [n = 2], ependymoma [n = 3]), neuroblastoma (n = 8), Wilms tumor (n = 1), and Ewing sarcoma (n = 1) were treated. Only one DLT occurred (grade 4 hyperuricemia at dose level 4). The most common grade 3 or 4 toxicity at least possibly related to perifosine was neutropenia (8.7%), with the remaining grade 3 or 4 toxicities (fatigue, hyperglycemia, fever, hyperuricemia, and catheter-related infection) occurring in one patient each. Pharmacokinetics was dose-saturable at doses above 50 mg/m2/day with significant inter-patient variability, consistent with findings reported in adult studies. One patient with DIPG (dose level 5) and 4 of 5 patients with high-grade glioma (dose levels 2 and 3) experienced stable disease for two months. Five subjects with neuroblastoma (dose levels 1 through 4) achieved stable disease which was prolonged (≥11 months) in three. No objective responses were noted. In conclusion, the use of perifosine was safe and feasible in patients with recurrent/refractory pediatric CNS and solid tumors. An MTD was not defined by the 5 dose levels investigated.

Causal somatic mutations in urine DNA from persons with the CLOVES subgroup of the PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum.,Clinical genetics,Clin. Genet.,2018-01-25,"Congenital lipomatous overgrowth with vascular, epidermal, and skeletal (CLOVES) anomalies and Klippel-Trenaunay (KTS) syndromes are caused by somatic gain-of-function mutations in PIK3CA, encoding a catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Affected tissue is needed to find mutations, as mutant alleles are not detectable in blood. Because some patients with CLOVES develop Wilms tumor, we tested urine as a source of DNA for mutation detection. We extracted DNA from the urine of 17 and 24 individuals with CLOVES and KTS, respectively, and screened 5 common PIK3CA mutation hotspots using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. Six of 17 CLOVES participants (35%) had mutant PIK3CA alleles in urine. Among 8 individuals in whom a mutation had been previously identified in affected tissue, 4 had the same mutant allele in the urine. One study participant with CLOVES had been treated for Wilms tumor. We detected the same PIK3CA mutation in her affected tissue, urine, and tumor, indicating Wilms tumors probably arise from PIK3CA mutant cells in patients with CLOVES. No urine sample from a participant with KTS had detectable PIK3CA mutations.

Phase 2 trial of a multivalent WT1 peptide vaccine (galinpepimut-S) in acute myeloid leukemia.,Blood advances,Blood Adv,2018-02-01,"A National Cancer Institute consensus study on prioritization of cancer antigens ranked the Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) protein as the top immunotherapy target in cancer. We previously reported a pilot study of a multivalent WT1 peptide vaccine (galinpepimut-S) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. We have now conducted a phase 2 study investigating this vaccine in adults with AML in first complete remission (CR1). Patients received 6 vaccinations administered over 10 weeks with the potential to receive 6 additional monthly doses if they remained in CR1. Immune responses (IRs) were evaluated after the 6th and 12th vaccinations by CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell proliferation, CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell interferon-γ secretion (enzyme-linked immunospot), or the CD8-relevant WT1 peptide major histocompatibility complex tetramer assay (HLA-A*02 patients only). Twenty-two patients (7 males; median age, 64 years) were treated. Fourteen patients (64%) completed ≥6 vaccinations, and 9 (41%) received all 12 vaccine doses. Fifteen patients (68%) relapsed, and 10 (46%) died. The vaccine was well tolerated, with the most common toxicities being grade 1/2 injection site reactions (46%), fatigue (32%), and skin induration (32%). Median disease-free survival from CR1 was 16.9 months, whereas the overall survival from diagnosis has not yet been reached but is estimated to be ≥67.6 months.

Clinical outcomes of children with Wilms tumor treated on a SIOP WT 2001 protocol in a tertiary care hospital in south India.,Journal of pediatric urology,J Pediatr Urol,2018-06-28,"Wilms tumor is the most common pediatric renal malignancy. While developed countries have had excellent survival, it remains poorer by comparison in developing countries. The aim was to analyze the clinical outcome of children with Wilms tumor managed in a developing country from 2004 to 2014 by the SIOP WT 2001 protocol. Fifty-nine children with Wilms tumor managed by a SIOP WT 2001 regimen from 2004 to 2014 were analyzed. The median age at presentation was 36 months, and 59% were boys. The average size of the tumor at presentation was 523 mL. Inferior vena cava thrombus was present in 11, distant metastases in 18, and bilateral tumors in six. Preoperative chemotherapy was given to all children after a diagnostic core needle biopsy. Preoperative chemotherapy reduced the tumor size to a mean of 208 mL and resolved venacaval thrombus in eight. Fifty-five children underwent definitive surgery while two children died during preoperative chemotherapy and two remained inoperable. All surviving children received adjuvant chemotherapy with 17 receiving radiotherapy as well. The overall survival (OS) was 80% and the event-free survival (EFS) was 73% after a mean follow up of 42 months after completion of therapy. The tumor volumes at presentation and the incidence of venous tumor thrombosis in our cohort were much higher than those reported from developed countries. The incidence of metastatic disease at diagnosis (30.5%) was significantly higher than the 10-12% reported in Western data, but similar to that reported from various developing countries (14.1-31%). The OS in our cohort was 80% and the EFS was 73% with there being no events after 28 months. Although the survival rate for localized disease is similar to that in developed countries, the OS for metastatic disease was significantly less (50% vs. 75%). We also found that using an upfront posterior flank core biopsy was safe and beneficial for differentiating Wilms tumor from other pediatric renal tumors that are less chemosensitive.

Baseline characteristics and outcomes of children with cancer in the English-speaking Caribbean: A multinational retrospective cohort.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2018-08-09,"English-speaking Caribbean (ESC) childhood cancer outcomes are unknown. Through the SickKids-Caribbean Initiative (SCI), we established a multicenter childhood cancer database across seven centers in six ESC countries. Data managers entered patient demographics, disease, treatment, and outcome data. Data collection commenced in 2013, with retrospective collection to 2011 and subsequent prospective collection. A total of 367 children were diagnosed between 2011 and 2015 with a median age of 5.7 years (interquartile range 2.9-10.6 years). One hundred thirty (35.4%) patients were diagnosed with leukemia, 30 (8.2%) with lymphoma, and 149 (40.6%) with solid tumors. A relative paucity of children with brain tumors was seen (N = 58, 15.8%). Two-year event-free survival (EFS) for the cohort was 48.5% ± 3.2%; 2-year overall survival (OS) was 55.1% ± 3.1%. Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Wilms tumor (WT) experienced better 2-year EFS (62.1% ± 6.4% and 66.7% ± 10.1%), while dismal outcomes were seen in children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 22.7 ± 9.6%), rhabdomyosarcoma (21.0% ± 17.0%), and medulloblastoma (21.4% ± 17.8%). Of 108 deaths with known cause, 58 (53.7%) were attributed to disease and 50 (46.3%) to treatment complications. Death within 60 days of diagnosis was relatively common in acute leukemia [13/98 (13.3%) ALL, 8/26 (30.8%) AML]. Despite this, traditional prognosticators adversely impacted outcome in ALL, including higher age, higher white blood cell count, and T-cell lineage. ESC childhood cancer outcomes are significantly inferior to high-income country outcomes.

Assessing the feasibility and validity of the Toronto Childhood Cancer Stage Guidelines: a population-based registry study.,The Lancet. Child & adolescent health,Lancet Child Adolesc Health,2018-02-01,"Cancer stage at diagnosis is crucial for assessing global efforts to increase awareness of childhood cancer and improve outcomes. However, consistent information on childhood cancer stage is absent from population cancer registries worldwide. The Toronto Childhood Cancer Stage Guidelines, compiled through an international consensus process, were designed to provide a standard framework for collection of information on stage at diagnosis of childhood cancers. We aimed to assess the feasibility of implementing the Toronto Guidelines within a national population cancer registry. We did a population-based registry study using data from the Australian Childhood Cancer Registry and included data from children aged 0-14 years diagnosed between Jan 1, 2006, and Dec 31, 2010 with one of 16 childhood cancers listed in the Toronto Guidelines (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumour, rhabdomyosarcoma, non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, retinoblastoma, hepatoblastoma, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, medulloblastoma, and ependymoma). We extracted data from medical records, and assigned stage according to the Tier 1 criteria (basic) and Tier 2 criteria (more detailed, requiring data from cytology, imaging, and other diagnostic tests, where available) using computer algorithms derived from the Toronto Guidelines. Additionally, expert reviewers independently assigned Tier 2 stage to a random subsample of 160 cases (ten per malignancy type). Feasibility of the guidelines was assessed on the percentage of cases that could be staged, agreement between stage assigned by the algorithms and the expert reviewers, and the mean time (min) taken to collect the required data. We obtained data for 1412 eligible children. Stage could be assigned according to Tier 2 criteria for 1318 (93%) cases, ranging from 48 (84%) of 57 cases of non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma to 46 (100%) cases of hepatoblastoma. According to Tier 1 criteria, stage could be assigned for 1329 (94%) cases, ranging from 131 (87%) of 151 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia to 46 (100%) cases of hepatoblastoma. By contrast, stage at diagnosis was recorded by the treating physician for 555 (39%) of the 1412 cases. The computer algorithm assigned the same stage as did one or more independent expert reviewers in 155 (97%) of the 160 cases assessed. The mean time taken to review medical records and extract the required data was 18·0 min (SD 9·5 per case).

Patients less than 16 years of age with a centrally confirmed pathological diagnosis of CCSK were eligible for treatment on this prospective single-arm study conducted between August 1995 and June 2002. Staging consisted of CT scans of chest, abdomen, pelvis, bone scan, skeletal survey, and CT or MRI of the head. Treatment consisted of vincristine/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide alternating with cyclophosphamide/etoposide for 24 weeks and radiation to sites of disease. One hundred eight eligible patients were enrolled on study (69% males, 63% Caucasian), with a median age of 22 months. Stage distribution was as follows: stage I, 12; II, 44; III, 45; IV, 7. Median follow-up was 9.7 years. Five-year EFS and OS were 79% (95% CI: 71%-88%) and 90% (95% CI: 84%-96%). Five-year EFS for stage I-IV was 100%, 88%, 73%, and 29%, respectively. Twenty of the 23 disease-related events occurred within three years of initial treatment. The most common site of recurrence was brain (12/23). The outcome for patients with CCSK treated on NWTS-5 was similar to NWTS-4 and accomplished over a shorter treatment duration. Stage was highly predictive of outcome.

Temporal patterns in the risk of chronic health conditions in survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed 1970-99: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort.,The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2018-11-08,"Treatments for childhood cancer have evolved over the past 50 years, with the goal of maximising the proportion of patients who achieve long-term survival, while minimising the adverse effects of therapy. We aimed to assess incidence patterns of serious chronic health conditions in long-term survivors of childhood cancer across three decades of diagnosis and treatment. We used data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, a retrospective cohort with longitudinal follow-up of 5-year survivors of common childhood cancers (leukaemia, tumours of the CNS, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Wilms tumour, neuroblastoma, soft tissue sarcoma, or bone tumours) who were diagnosed before the age of 21 years and from 1970 to 1999 in North America. We examined the cumulative incidence of severe to fatal chronic health conditions occurring up to 20 years post-diagnosis among survivors, compared by diagnosis decade. We used multivariable regression models to estimate hazard ratios per diagnosis decade, and we added treatment variables to assess whether treatment changes attenuated associations between diagnosis decade and chronic disease risk. Among 23 601 survivors with a median follow-up of 21 years (IQR 15-25), the 20-year cumulative incidence of at least one grade 3-5 chronic condition decreased significantly from 33·2% (95% CI 32·0-34·3) in those diagnosed 1970-79 to 29·3% (28·4-30·2; p<0·0001) in 1980-89, and 27·5% (26·4-28·6; p=0·012 vs 1980-89) in 1990-99. By comparison, the 20-year cumulative incidence of at least one grade 3-5 condition in 5051 siblings was 4·6% (95% CI 3·9-5·2). The 15-year cumulative incidence of at least one grade 3-5 condition was lower for survivors diagnosed 1990-99 compared with those diagnosed 1970-79 for Hodgkin lymphoma (17·7% [95% CI 15·0-20·5] vs 26·4% [23·8-29·1]; p<0·0001), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (16·9% [14·0-19·7] vs 23·8% [19·9-27·7]; p=0.0053), astrocytoma (30·5% [27·8-33·2] vs 47·3% [42·9-51·7]; p<0·0001), Wilms tumour (11·9% [9·5-14·3] vs 17·6% [14·3-20·8]; p=0·034), soft tissue sarcoma (28·3% [23·5-33·1] vs 36·5% [31·5-41·4]; p=0·021), and osteosarcoma (65·6% [60·6-70·6] vs 87·5% [84·1-91·0]; p<0·0001). By contrast, the 15-year cumulative incidence of at least one grade 3-5 condition was higher (1990-99 vs 1970-79) for medulloblastoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumour (58·9% [54·4-63·3] vs 42·9% [34·9-50·9]; p=0·00060), and neuroblastoma (25·0% [21·8-28·2] vs 18·0% [14·5-21·6]; p=0·0045). Results were consistent with changes in treatment as a significant mediator of the association between diagnosis decade and risk of grade 3-5 chronic conditions for astrocytoma (HR per decade without treatment in the model = 0·77, 95% CI 0·64-0·92; HR with treatment in the model=0·89, 95% CI 0·72-1·11; p<sub>mediation</sub>=0·0085) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HR without treatment=0·75, 95% CI 0·65-0·85; HR with treatment=0·91, 95% CI 0·73-1·12; p<sub>mediation</sub>=0·024). Temporal decreases in 15-year cumulative incidence comparing survivors diagnosed 1970-79 to survivors diagnosed 1990-99 were noted for endocrinopathies (5·9% [5·3-6·4] vs 2·8% [2·5-3·2]; p<0·0001), subsequent malignant neoplasms (2·7% [2·3-3·1] vs 1·9% [1·6-2·2]; p=0·0033), musculoskeletal conditions (5·8% [5·2-6·4] vs 3·3% [2·9-3·6]; p<0·0001), and gastrointestinal conditions (2·3% [2·0-2·7] vs 1·5% [1·3-1·8]; p=0·00037), while hearing loss increased (3·0% [2·6-3·5] vs 5·7% [5·2-6·1]; p<0·0001). Our results suggest that more recently treated survivors of childhood cancer had improvements in health outcomes, consistent with efforts over the same time period to modify childhood cancer treatment regimens to maximise overall survival, while reducing risk of long-term adverse events. Continuing advances in cancer therapy offer promise of further reducing the risk of long-term adverse events in childhood cancer survivors. However, achieving long-term survival for childhood cancer continues to come at a cost for many survivors, emphasising the importance of long-term follow-up care for this population.

Adult Wilms Tumor During Pregnancy: Case Report and Literature Review.,Urology,Urology,2018-12-28,"Adult Wilms tumor (WT) is a well-known, albeit rare entity and has historically been associated with worse overall clinical outcomes when compared to younger patients. Because WT is uncommon in adult patients, it is often misdiagnosed and treated off standardized pediatric protocols.

High-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem-cell rescue for treatment of relapsed and refractory Wilms tumor: Re-evaluating outcomes.,Pediatric hematology and oncology,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,2019-01-25,"Wilms tumor (WT) treatment regimens are curative for more than 80% of patients, but those with relapsed or refractory disease continue to have poor outcomes. High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue is often utilized although outcomes remain variable. We report on HD-ASCR outcomes in 24 patients with relapsed or refractory Wilms tumor. Three-year disease free and overall survival are 46% and 60%, respectively, which is similar to those reported for conventional salvage therapies. These outcomes suggest that conventional salvage therapies should be employed for relapsed and refractory WT rather than HD-ASCR.",Journal Article,361.0,0.0,Wilms WT treatment regimens curative 80 patients relapsed refractory disease continue poor outcomes High-dose chemotherapy followed autologous stem rescue utilized outcomes remain variable report HD-ASCR outcomes 24 patients relapsed refractory Wilms Three-year disease free overall survival 46 60 respectively similar reported conventional salvage therapies outcomes suggest conventional salvage therapies employed relapsed refractory WT HD-ASCR,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[30, 1820, 24, 472, 32, 1075, 9, 80, 76, 493, 1, 7, 84, 135, 5, 591, 15, 430, 34, 1906, 6, 47, 334, 123, 64, 61, 56, 370, 20, 1028, 452, 31, 4256, 16, 629, 2080, 242, 123, 918, 1347, 21, 414, 23, 2701, 10729, 123, 4, 259, 7, 5, 591, 15, 430, 30, 169, 111, 34, 115, 2, 63, 25, 32, 641, 2, 335, 106, 92, 16, 288, 6, 135, 210, 9, 809, 992, 235, 46, 123, 309, 17, 809, 992, 235, 257, 40, 2516, 9, 591, 2, 430, 1820, 1832, 76, 2701, 10729]",611.0,30681039,High-dose chemotherapy autologous hematopoietic stem-cell rescue treatment relapsed refractory Wilms Re-evaluating outcomes,1,0.007194244604316547
