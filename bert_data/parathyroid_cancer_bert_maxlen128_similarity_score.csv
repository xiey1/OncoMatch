Genotype-phenotype analysis in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.,"Archives of surgery (Chicago, Ill. : 1960)",Arch Surg,2002-06-01,"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline mutations in the MEN1 gene and characterized by multiple endocrine tumors, most notably in the parathyroid glands, pituitary, and pancreas. The syndrome demonstrates variable expressivity and considerable genetic heterogeneity. Patient data were examined for possible associations between genotype and phenotype. We reviewed recorded medical data from 1975 to 2001 on patients with MEN 1 and compared specific types and locations of MEN1 gene mutations with manifestations of the syndrome. We identified 109 affected patients from 24 MEN 1 kindreds. The phenotypic expression of MEN 1 in affected individuals included hyperparathyroidism in 74%, pancreatic endocrine tumors in 51%, and pituitary tumors in 35%. Twelve of 14 insulinomas occurred in patients with pituitary tumors. Mutation analysis was completed in 14 of 24 kindreds (80 of the 109 patients). Mutations were most common in exons 2 (31%), 9 (15%), and 10 (23%). All 21 patients with frameshift mutations (and known pancreatic endocrine tumor status) had such tumors. Pituitary tumors were associated with frameshift mutations in exon 2. The type and location of MEN1 mutations may be associated with the phenotypic expression of specific tumors. Such information may assist in the genetic counseling and surveillance of at-risk patients. A specific genotype-phenotype correlation is unlikely because of the heterogeneity of the mutations in the MEN1 gene.",Journal Article,6443.0,,Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 MEN 1 syndrome autosomal dominant disorder caused germline MEN1 characterized multiple endocrine notably parathyroid glands pituitary pancreas syndrome demonstrates variable expressivity considerable genetic heterogeneity Patient examined possible associations genotype phenotype reviewed recorded medical 1975 2001 patients MEN 1 compared specific types locations MEN1 manifestations syndrome identified 109 affected patients 24 MEN 1 kindreds phenotypic expression MEN 1 affected individuals included hyperparathyroidism 74 pancreatic endocrine 51 pituitary 35 14 insulinomas occurred patients pituitary completed 14 24 kindreds 80 109 patients common exons 2 31 9 15 10 23 21 patients frameshift known pancreatic endocrine status Pituitary associated frameshift exon 2 type location MEN1 associated phenotypic expression specific information assist genetic counseling surveillance at-risk patients specific genotype-phenotype correlation unlikely heterogeneity MEN1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[232, 1293, 2298, 267, 14, 325, 14, 681, 16, 35, 6084, 2156, 2645, 1546, 20, 1009, 138, 4, 3, 7923, 145, 2, 765, 20, 232, 1293, 57, 96, 2552, 4, 3, 3966, 2, 3, 681, 1902, 1347, 42949, 2, 2658, 336, 1144, 69, 74, 11, 409, 9, 899, 685, 59, 1183, 2, 1005, 21, 446, 1872, 484, 74, 29, 7585, 6, 1758, 23, 7, 5, 325, 14, 2, 72, 112, 630, 2, 4069, 1, 7923, 145, 138, 5, 4282, 1, 3, 681, 21, 108, 3486, 1424, 7, 29, 259, 325, 14, 10141, 3, 3290, 55, 1, 325, 14, 4, 1424, 869, 159, 9630, 4, 794, 1293, 57, 4, 725, 2, 57, 4, 465, 2544, 1, 213, 24465, 489, 4, 7, 5, 57, 258, 65, 10, 781, 4, 213, 1, 259, 10141, 493, 1, 3, 3486, 7, 138, 11, 96, 186, 4, 3885, 18, 456, 83, 167, 2, 79, 382, 62, 239, 7, 5, 9425, 138, 2, 440, 1293, 30, 156, 42, 225, 57, 57, 11, 41, 5, 9425, 138, 4, 1725, 18, 3, 267, 2, 1147, 1, 7923, 138, 68, 40, 41, 5, 3, 3290, 55, 1, 112, 57, 225, 487, 68, 3425, 4, 3, 336, 2011, 2, 617, 1, 28, 43, 7, 8, 112, 1183, 1005, 816, 16, 3568, 408, 1, 3, 1144, 1, 3, 138, 4, 3, 7923, 145]",1404.0,12049533,Genotype-phenotype multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1,0,0.0
Pitfalls of intraoperative quick parathyroid hormone monitoring and gamma probe localization in surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism.,"Archives of surgery (Chicago, Ill. : 1960)",Arch Surg,2002-06-01,"Intraoperative quick parathyroid hormone (qPTH) monitoring and gamma probe (GP) localization greatly aid the surgeon. Prospective case series of patients undergoing parathyroidectomy (PTX) with preoperative localization studies, operative data (including intraoperative qPTH values and GP localization), and outcomes. Follow-up was complete (mean, 4.2 months). University teaching hospital. We studied 57 consecutive patients with primary hyperparathyroidism from December 1, 1999, through November 30, 2000. Of these, 51 underwent first-time PTX, and 6, reoperative PTX (rePTX). Cure rate and morbidity after PTX or rePTX; sensitivity and accuracy of preoperative localization studies; prediction of cure from results of qPTH monitoring (comparing Nichols [>50% fall from the highest baseline level and lower than the lowest baseline] or normal-limit [>50% fall from first baseline level and lower than upper limit of the reference range] criteria); and value of GP localization. Patients were cured in 50 (98%) of 51 PTX and 6 (100%) of 6 rePTX for single adenomas (n = 49), double adenomas (n = 4), and multigland hyperplasia (n = 3). Nichols criteria for qPTH monitoring correctly categorized 45 (92%) of 49 cured single adenomas 10 minutes after excision. Only 35 (71%) of these adenomas were correctly categorized as cured by means of the normal-limit criteria. In double adenomas, both sets of criteria in the 10-minute samples indicated unresected glands in only 2 of 4 cases. Preoperative sestamibi parathyroid scans correctly localized 38 (76%) of 50 single adenomas. The GP was used in 54 of 57 cases. All adenomas measured greater than 20% of background ex vivo, but 6 thyroid nodules also measured greater than 20% ex vivo. In double adenomas, the GP helped locate the second adenoma in only 1 of 4 cases. The GP was graded as crucial in 2 cases with dense scar (both rePTX), helpful in 12 (22%) of 54 cases (particularly in retroesophageal glands), confirmatory in 32 (59%), and not helpful in 8 (15%). The GP helped localize 3 (43%) of 7 glands not seen on sestamibi parathyroid scans. Intraoperative qPTH monitoring confirmed cure in most cases. For single adenomas, use of the Nichols criteria for qPTH assessment allowed more accurate and faster confirmation than the normal-limit criteria. The GP was less useful but was crucial in 2 rePTX cases; it was not specific for parathyroid tissue.

Novel approaches to the management of bone metastases in patients with breast cancer.,Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2002-06-01,"Bone metastases appear frequently in patients with advanced breast cancer. They are associated with substantial morbidity and occasionally produce life-threatening complications. Systemic anticancer therapies (chemotherapy and hormonal therapies) represent the treatment of choice for these and other distant metastases from breast cancer. Aggressive use of prophylactic and therapeutic orthopedic surgery is warranted, especially for lesions in weight-bearing areas. Judicious use of external radiotherapy and bone-seeking radionuclides contributes to the control of pain and local control of lesions in strategic locations. In recent years, the development of osteoclast-inhibitory therapy added a new dimension to symptom control and prevention of skeletal complications. The bisphosphonates, clodronate, pamidronate, and zoledronic acid, are potent osteoclast inhibitors with marked clinical effects. They represent the drugs of choice for control of hypercalcemia of malignancy, and they are critical adjuvants to systemic anticancer therapy of metastatic disease.

Patients were monitored for toxicity and tumor response, and blood and urine samples were collected for pharmacokinetics (1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(2) levels) and other parameters of biological activity (bone markers, parathyroid hormone, urine calcium, and serum phosphorus levels). Twenty-five patients were enrolled. Main toxicities were hypercalcemia with associated renal insufficiency. No other significant toxicity was seen. Pharmacokinetics showed an increase in the active metabolite 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(2) that reached a plateau by week 4 despite continuous drug dosing. Elevation in daily urinary calcium excretion and serum phosphorus levels was seen, whereas a decrease in serum parathyroid hormone was evident. Two patients showed evidence of a partial response, whereas 5 others achieved disease stabilization for > or =6 months. 1alpha-Hydroxyvitamin D(2) was well tolerated with main toxicities being hypercalcemia and renal insufficiency.

Recurrent or persistent hyperparathyroidism.,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,J. Bone Miner. Res.,2002-11-01,"Approximately 90% of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) are cured by parathyroidectomy at the initial neck exploration. Those not cured either remain hypercalcemic in the immediate postoperative period or develop hypercalcemia after a long period of normocalcemia. Almost all cases of hypercalcemia after neck exploration for PHPT are evident early in the postoperative period and are caused either by an overlooked parathyroid adenoma or an incomplete resection of hyperplastic parathyroid tissue. Less commonly, the surgeon has failed to recognize, and adequately treat, parathyroid carcinoma, or the diagnosis of PHPT was incorrect and there is another cause of the hypercalcemia. A successful neck exploration for PHPT is primarily dependent on the experience of the operating surgeon, the anatomic location of the parathyroid glands, either in ""normal"" or ""ectopic"" sites, and the presence of a single enlarged parathyroid gland as opposed to multiglandular disease or parathyroid carcinoma. In cases where an enlarged parathyroid gland is not identified at operation, noninvasive or invasive radiographic imaging procedures are useful in localizing the gland. Currently, the most reliable and practical procedure is technetium 99m sestamibi scanning. This technique identifies an enlarged parathyroid gland in 65-80% of cases. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in association with sestamibi scanning increases the sensitivity of the procedure to 85%. These imaging procedures are least reliable in patients with multiglandular disease. Ultrasound and computed tomographic scanning are less sensitive; however, they are commonly used as confirmatory tests in association with sestamibi scanning. When noninvasive imaging procedures fail to identify an enlarged parathyroid gland, invasive procedures, such as selective arteriography, are performed. Whereas invasive procedures are useful, they are associated with significant morbidity. Reoperations for persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism, compared with the initial operations, are associated with higher complication rates. In 90% of cases, the abnormal pathology can be reached through a cervical incision. The success rate of the reoperation depends primarily on the results of the localization procedure and whether the patient has a single enlarged parathyroid gland or multiglandular disease. Resection of a single enlarged gland is curative in virtually all patients. If, however, the patient has multiple gland disease, the operation is successful less often, especially in those with certain familial endocrinopathies.",Journal Article,6290.0,46.0,Approximately 90 patients primary hyperparathyroidism PHPT cured parathyroidectomy initial neck exploration cured remain hypercalcemic immediate postoperative period develop hypercalcemia long period normocalcemia cases hypercalcemia neck exploration PHPT evident early postoperative period caused overlooked parathyroid adenoma incomplete resection hyperplastic parathyroid tissue commonly surgeon failed recognize adequately treat parathyroid carcinoma diagnosis PHPT incorrect cause hypercalcemia successful neck exploration PHPT primarily dependent experience operating surgeon anatomic location parathyroid glands `` normal '' `` ectopic '' sites presence single enlarged parathyroid gland opposed multiglandular disease parathyroid carcinoma cases enlarged parathyroid gland identified operation noninvasive invasive radiographic imaging procedures useful localizing gland Currently reliable practical procedure technetium 99m sestamibi scanning technique identifies enlarged parathyroid gland 65-80 cases Single photon emission computed tomography SPECT association sestamibi scanning increases sensitivity procedure 85 imaging procedures reliable patients multiglandular disease Ultrasound computed tomographic scanning sensitive commonly confirmatory tests association sestamibi scanning noninvasive imaging procedures fail identify enlarged parathyroid gland invasive procedures selective arteriography performed invasive procedures useful associated significant morbidity Reoperations persistent recurrent hyperparathyroidism compared initial operations associated higher complication rates 90 cases abnormal pathology reached cervical incision success rate reoperation depends primarily localization procedure patient single enlarged parathyroid gland multiglandular disease Resection single enlarged gland curative virtually patients patient multiple gland disease operation successful especially certain familial endocrinopathies,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[705, 424, 1, 7, 5, 86, 9630, 19512, 32, 3733, 20, 23116, 28, 3, 388, 3370, 135, 44, 3733, 361, 918, 24534, 4, 3, 2181, 573, 727, 15, 690, 6210, 50, 8, 319, 727, 1, 53190, 2214, 62, 140, 1, 6210, 50, 3370, 9, 19512, 32, 2853, 191, 4, 3, 573, 727, 2, 32, 1546, 361, 20, 35, 12549, 2434, 15, 35, 2610, 170, 1, 8179, 246, 299, 841, 3, 1897, 71, 1551, 6, 4237, 2, 4215, 943, 134, 15, 3, 147, 1, 19512, 10, 11774, 2, 125, 16, 1809, 708, 1, 3, 6210, 8, 1401, 3370, 9, 19512, 16, 1561, 470, 23, 3, 730, 1, 3, 2584, 1897, 3, 2745, 1147, 1, 3, 3966, 361, 4, 295, 522, 15, 3647, 522, 633, 2, 3, 463, 1, 8, 226, 7547, 2326, 22, 6101, 6, 33318, 34, 15, 134, 4, 140, 1257, 35, 7547, 2326, 16, 44, 108, 28, 2589, 2957, 15, 416, 1580, 270, 1369, 32, 999, 4, 14384, 3, 2326, 694, 3, 96, 2450, 2, 3320, 1299, 16, 11237, 6314, 11566, 3702, 26, 1312, 2953, 35, 7547, 2326, 4, 556, 493, 1, 140, 226, 4216, 1799, 1220, 872, 5817, 4, 248, 5, 11566, 3702, 1106, 3, 485, 1, 3, 1299, 6, 772, 46, 270, 1369, 32, 506, 2450, 4, 7, 5, 33318, 34, 1945, 2, 1220, 6158, 3702, 32, 299, 745, 137, 491, 32, 841, 95, 22, 5697, 895, 4, 248, 5, 11566, 3702, 198, 2957, 270, 1369, 4373, 6, 255, 35, 7547, 2326, 416, 1369, 225, 22, 1094, 53191, 32, 173, 547, 416, 1369, 32, 999, 491, 32, 41, 5, 93, 787, 10691, 9, 1882, 15, 387, 9630, 72, 5, 3, 388, 3867, 32, 41, 5, 142, 1447, 151, 4, 424, 1, 140, 3, 1668, 1117, 122, 40, 1300, 298, 8, 7538, 3, 1825, 116, 1, 3, 5077, 3828, 1561, 23, 3, 99, 1, 3, 2145, 1299, 2, 317, 3, 69, 71, 8, 226, 7547, 2326, 15, 33318, 34, 170, 1, 8, 226, 7547, 2326, 16, 1075, 4, 5860, 62, 7, 492, 137, 3, 69, 71, 232, 2326, 34, 3, 2589, 16, 1401, 299, 629, 1093, 4, 135, 5, 1840, 2200, 12081]",2438.0,12412795,Recurrent persistent hyperparathyroidism,0,0.0
"Menin associates with FANCD2, a protein involved in repair of DNA damage.",Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2003-07-01,"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN1) is an inherited tumor syndrome characterized by tumors in multiple endocrine organs including the parathyroids, pancreatic islets, and the pituitary. The gene mutated in MEN1 patients, Men1, encodes a protein of 610 amino acid residues, menin, and mutations in the Men1 gene lead to the MEN1 syndrome. Although the chromosomal instability in the peripheral lymphocytes from the MEN1 patients has been reported previously, it is not clear whether menin is involved in repair of DNA damage. Here we show that menin specifically interacts with FANCD2, a protein encoded by a gene involved in DNA repair and mutated in patients with an inherited cancer-prone syndrome, Fanconi anemia. The interaction between menin and FANCD2 is enhanced by gamma-irradiation. Moreover, loss of menin expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts leads to increased sensitivity to DNA damage. Furthermore, menin is localized to chromatin and nuclear matrix, and the association with nuclear matrix is enhanced by gamma-irradiation. Together, these results suggest that menin plays a critical role in repair of DNA damage in concert with FANCD2.",Journal Article,6048.0,121.0,Multiple endocrine neoplasia type MEN1 inherited syndrome characterized multiple endocrine organs including parathyroids pancreatic islets pituitary MEN1 patients Men1 encodes 610 amino acid residues menin Men1 lead MEN1 syndrome chromosomal instability peripheral lymphocytes MEN1 patients reported previously clear menin involved repair DNA damage menin specifically interacts FANCD2 encoded involved DNA repair patients inherited cancer-prone syndrome Fanconi anemia interaction menin FANCD2 enhanced gamma-irradiation loss menin expression mouse embryonic fibroblasts leads increased sensitivity DNA damage Furthermore menin localized chromatin nuclear matrix association nuclear matrix enhanced gamma-irradiation suggest menin plays critical role repair DNA damage concert FANCD2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[232, 1293, 2298, 267, 70, 7923, 16, 35, 2986, 30, 681, 765, 20, 57, 4, 232, 1293, 2285, 141, 3, 53644, 12746, 2, 3, 3, 145, 1185, 4, 7923, 7, 7923, 4322, 8, 178, 1, 11302, 3078, 971, 6418, 9191, 2, 138, 4, 3, 7923, 145, 1122, 6, 3, 7923, 681, 242, 3, 1860, 1753, 4, 3, 672, 1594, 29, 3, 7923, 7, 71, 85, 210, 373, 192, 16, 44, 885, 317, 9191, 16, 646, 4, 972, 1, 261, 1350, 467, 21, 514, 17, 9191, 1225, 5528, 5, 8949, 8, 178, 4587, 20, 8, 145, 646, 4, 261, 972, 2, 1185, 4, 7, 5, 35, 2986, 12, 7104, 681, 8057, 1545, 3, 915, 59, 9191, 2, 8949, 16, 651, 20, 1705, 1104, 1393, 407, 1, 9191, 55, 4, 830, 5390, 3921, 1940, 6, 101, 485, 6, 261, 1350, 798, 9191, 16, 909, 6, 2287, 2, 928, 2248, 2, 3, 248, 5, 928, 2248, 16, 651, 20, 1705, 1104, 1162, 46, 99, 309, 17, 9191, 1698, 8, 740, 200, 4, 972, 1, 261, 1350, 4, 10562, 5, 8949]",1118.0,12874027,Menin associates FANCD2 involved repair DNA damage,0,0.0
Novel approaches to the management of bone metastases.,Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2003-10-01,"Standard management of breast cancer metastatic to bone includes systemic chemotherapy and, if applicable, hormone therapy, as well as radiotherapy for control of pain or prevention of pathologic fractures. In addition, orthopedic surgical procedures are used to prevent or correct pathologic fractures in weight-bearing areas of the osseous skeleton. Inhibitors of osteoclast function, including bisphosphonates and gallium nitrate, have been shown in clinical trials to decrease bone-related complications. Consequently, bisphosphonates have become an integral part of the management of bone metastases from breast cancer. Improved understanding of the biology of osteoclastogenesis led to the identification of osteoprotegerin as a critical modulator of osteoclast activity.

Impact of intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring on the prediction of multiglandular parathyroid disease.,World journal of surgery,World J Surg,2004-01-08,"Optimal interpretation of the results of intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring during neck exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is still controversial. The reliability of the ""50% rule"" in multiglandular disease (MGD) is often disputed, mostly because of competing pathophysiologic paradigms. The aim of this study was to ascertain and corroborate the ability of IOPTH monitoring to detect MGD in a practice, combining conventional and alternative parathyroidectomy techniques. This is a retrospective single institution analysis of 69 consecutive patients undergoing cervical exploration for pHPT by various approaches. The IOPTH measurements were performed after induction of anesthesia but prior to skin incision and 10 minutes after excision of the first visualized enlarged parathyroid gland. In this series, 55 patients (80%) had single adenomas, and 14 patients (20%) had MGD. In 8 of the 14 patients with MGD, IOPTH levels were obtained sequentially after removal of every enlarged gland. Of these 8 patients, 6 (75%) had a false-positive decrease (decrease below 50% of baseline value in presence of another enlarged gland) failing to predict the presence of a second enlarged gland.

Pathol.,2004-08-01,"The current classification of sporadic parathyroid neoplasia, specifically the distinction of adenoma from multiple gland neoplasia (double adenoma and nonfamilial primary hyperplasia) is problematic and results in a relatively high rate of clinical error. Oligonucleotide microarrays (Affymetrix U133A) were used to evaluate parathyroid samples from 61 patients; 35 adenomas, 10 nonfamilial multiple gland neoplasia, 3 familial primary hyperplasia, 8 renal-induced hyperplasia, and 5 from patients without parathyroid disease (normals). A multiclass comparison using supervised clustering identified distinct gene signatures for each class of parathyroid samples. We developed a predictor model that correctly identified 34 of 35 cases of adenoma, 9 of 10 cases of nonfamilial multiple gland neoplasia, and identified a minimum set of 11 genes for the distinction of adenoma versus multiple gland neoplasia. All methods of unsupervised clustering showed two related but different types of parathyroid adenomas that we have arbitrarily designated as type 1 and type 2 adenomas.

We included all patients with parathyroid carcinoma seen at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center since January 1, 1980. The medical records and pathology specimens were reviewed and verified in all cases. Since 1980, 27 patients (16 men and 11 women) registered at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center with parathyroid carcinoma and a minimum follow-up of 2 years. The age at initial diagnosis (mean +/- SD) was 46.7 +/- 15.3 years. All patients were seen with hypercalcemia (mean calcium, 13.4 +/- 1.5 mg/dL). Eighteen patients had locally invasive disease, eight had localized disease, and one had distant metastasis. Parathyroid cancer was treated with complete surgical excision with curative intent in 18 patients. In the other nine patients, who had clinical and/or radiographic evidence of soft tissue extension, the tumor was treated by comprehensive ""en bloc"" soft tissue resection. Of six patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy after initial surgery, only one had a local relapse. In contrast, of 20 patients who did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy, 10 had a local relapse, excluding the one patient who had distant metastases. The 5-year survival was 85%, and the 10-year survival was 77%. Five patients died of parathyroid carcinoma; all deaths were hypercalcemia related.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 parathyroid adenoma development over time.,World journal of surgery,World J Surg,2004-11-01,"Multiple gland parathyroid disease is one of the hallmarks of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1. Often mislabeled parathyroid hyperplasia, the process is actually the development of multiple adenomas. Some clinicians have reported results of selective parathyroidectomy in this group, removing only grossly enlarged glands. We argue that all the glands are at risk and should be addressed at any planned parathyroid intervention. Our hypothesis is that, given sufficient time, patients would all develop adenomas in each of the parathyroid glands. Our available data to address this issue are the parathyroidectomy results from a single institution series. Patients who had initial parathyroid exploration for hyperparathyroidism in the setting of MEN-1 were reviewed. This study includes those patients who had the weights of the resected glands documented; 23 men and 21 women met the criteria. The total weight of the parathyroid glands did not vary with the age of the patient at operation. However, the number of normal glands identified did vary significantly with age (p < 0.02), with older patients being less likely to have any normal parathyroid glands. Although total parathyroid weight may correlate with development of hypercalcemia and indications for operation, the involvement of multiple parathyroid glands in MEN-1 is a function of time, as independent events in each gland must occur. Given time, MEN-1 patients all develop multiple gland disease, and this reality must be used in planning operative management for patients with this syndrome.",Journal Article,5559.0,25.0,Multiple gland parathyroid disease hallmarks multiple endocrine neoplasia MEN type 1 mislabeled parathyroid hyperplasia process actually development multiple adenomas clinicians reported selective parathyroidectomy group removing grossly enlarged glands argue glands risk addressed planned parathyroid intervention hypothesis given sufficient time patients develop adenomas parathyroid glands available address issue parathyroidectomy single institution series Patients initial parathyroid exploration hyperparathyroidism setting MEN-1 reviewed includes patients weights resected glands documented 23 men 21 women met criteria total weight parathyroid glands vary age patient operation number normal glands identified vary significantly age p 0.02 older patients likely normal parathyroid glands total parathyroid weight correlate development hypercalcemia indications operation involvement multiple parathyroid glands MEN-1 function time independent events gland occur Given time MEN-1 patients develop multiple gland disease reality planning operative management patients syndrome,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[232, 2326, 34, 16, 104, 1, 3, 7693, 1, 232, 1293, 2298, 325, 267, 14, 629, 54413, 3176, 3, 1129, 16, 6742, 3, 193, 1, 232, 2751, 476, 1490, 47, 210, 99, 1, 1094, 23116, 4, 26, 87, 9026, 158, 7185, 7547, 3966, 21, 7004, 17, 62, 3, 3966, 32, 28, 43, 2, 257, 40, 2814, 28, 500, 1465, 788, 114, 1492, 16, 17, 447, 1952, 98, 7, 688, 62, 690, 2751, 4, 296, 1, 3, 3966, 114, 390, 74, 6, 1539, 26, 2537, 32, 3, 23116, 99, 29, 8, 226, 731, 988, 7, 54, 42, 388, 3370, 9, 9630, 4, 3, 546, 1, 325, 14, 11, 446, 26, 45, 1920, 135, 7, 54, 42, 3, 7966, 1, 3, 1133, 3966, 1405, 382, 325, 2, 239, 117, 543, 3, 371, 3, 181, 924, 1, 3, 3966, 205, 44, 2825, 5, 3, 89, 1, 3, 69, 28, 2589, 137, 3, 207, 1, 295, 3966, 108, 205, 2825, 97, 5, 89, 19, 13, 588, 5, 434, 7, 486, 299, 322, 6, 47, 500, 295, 3966, 242, 181, 924, 68, 1513, 5, 193, 1, 6210, 2, 2406, 9, 2589, 3, 799, 1, 232, 3966, 4, 325, 14, 16, 8, 343, 1, 98, 22, 306, 281, 4, 296, 2326, 1642, 1271, 447, 98, 325, 14, 7, 62, 690, 232, 2326, 34, 2, 26, 9265, 1642, 40, 95, 4, 1349, 1208, 284, 9, 7, 5, 26, 681]",1433.0,15490065,Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 parathyroid adenoma development time,4,0.10256410256410256

Intraoperative jugular venous sampling AIDS detection of an undescended parathyroid adenoma.,World journal of surgery,World J Surg,2006-04-01,"A missed parathyroid adenoma is an important cause of persistent or recurrent primary hyperparathyroidism. Despite the widespread use of preoperative localizing tests and the advent of the rapid intact blood parathyroid hormone assay (iPTH), difficult operative cases are encountered when abnormal parathyroid glands cannot be identified. Over a 5-year period, 466 neck explorations were performed for primary hyperparathyroidism. This retrospective report describes the use of intraoperative jugular venous sampling to locate and remove successfully undescended parathyroid adenomas in three patients. Intraoperative jugular venous sampling for iPTH analysis was performed when a thorough neck exploration in combination with peripheral iPTH failed to reveal a source of hyperparathyroidism in patients with biochemically confirmed hyperparathyroidism. In all patients, a two- to fourfold iPTH gradient was observed between the affected and unaffected sides, and an undescended adenoma was located near the carotid bifurcation. Intraoperative jugular venous sampling with iPTH analysis may be a useful technique for successfully detecting an undescended adenoma when other, more routine measures have failed.",Journal Article,5043.0,9.0,missed parathyroid adenoma important cause persistent recurrent primary hyperparathyroidism Despite widespread use preoperative localizing tests advent rapid intact blood parathyroid hormone iPTH difficult operative cases encountered abnormal parathyroid glands identified 5-year period 466 neck explorations performed primary hyperparathyroidism retrospective report describes use intraoperative jugular venous sampling locate remove successfully undescended parathyroid adenomas patients Intraoperative jugular venous sampling iPTH performed thorough neck exploration combination peripheral iPTH failed reveal source hyperparathyroidism patients biochemically confirmed hyperparathyroidism patients two- fourfold iPTH gradient observed affected unaffected sides undescended adenoma located near carotid bifurcation Intraoperative jugular venous sampling iPTH useful technique successfully detecting undescended adenoma routine measures failed,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[8, 5149, 2434, 16, 35, 305, 708, 1, 1882, 15, 387, 86, 9630, 550, 3, 3029, 119, 1, 498, 14384, 895, 2, 3, 4114, 1, 3, 1321, 2964, 315, 785, 719, 30924, 1740, 1208, 140, 32, 3903, 198, 1668, 3966, 122, 44, 40, 108, 252, 8, 33, 111, 727, 13638, 19063, 11, 173, 9, 86, 9630, 26, 459, 414, 2677, 3, 119, 1, 1720, 21384, 2167, 2874, 6, 15124, 2, 7930, 1878, 38135, 2751, 4, 169, 7, 1720, 21384, 2167, 2874, 9, 30924, 65, 10, 173, 198, 8, 5506, 3370, 4, 150, 5, 672, 30924, 1551, 6, 2396, 8, 2353, 1, 9630, 4, 7, 5, 7944, 557, 9630, 4, 62, 7, 8, 100, 6, 15155, 30924, 7099, 10, 164, 59, 3, 1424, 2, 4585, 10958, 2, 35, 38135, 2434, 10, 2308, 1829, 3, 8319, 18788, 1720, 21384, 2167, 2874, 5, 30924, 65, 68, 40, 8, 999, 1312, 9, 1878, 2502, 35, 38135, 2434, 198, 127, 80, 1311, 1018, 47, 1551]",1138.0,16555025,Intraoperative jugular venous sampling AIDS detection undescended parathyroid adenoma,0,0.0

Over-expression of parathyroid hormone Type 1 receptor confers an aggressive phenotype in osteosarcoma.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2007-09-01,"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone malignancy in children and is associated with rapid bone growth. Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) signaling via parathyroid hormone Type 1 receptor (PTHR1) is important for skeletal development and is involved in bone metastases in other tumors. The aim of this study was to investigate the status of PTHrP/PTHR1 and its possible role in osteosarcoma. In a preliminary screening, a higher level of PTHR1 mRNA, but not PTHrP, was found in 4 osteosarcoma xenografts as compared with 4 standard cell lines, or 5 patient derived cell lines (p < 0.05) using quantitative RT-PCR. It was therefore extended to 55 patient specimens, in which a significantly higher level of PTHR1 mRNA was detected in metastatic or relapsed samples than those from primary sites (p < 0.01). Cell behavior caused by PTHR1 overexpression was further studied in vitro using PTHR1 transfected HOS cell line as a model. Over-expression of PHTR1 resulted in increased proliferation, motility and Matrigel invasion without addition of exogenous PTHrP suggesting an autocrine effect. Importantly, the aggressiveness in PTHR1-expressing cells was completely reversed by RNAi mediated gene knockdown. In addition, PTHR1 over-expression led to delayed osteoblastic differentiation and upregulation of genes involved in extracellular matrix production, such as TGF-beta1 and connective tissue growth factor. When cocultured with bone marrow derived monocytes, PTHR1 transfected HOS cells induced a greater number of osteoclasts. This study suggests that PTHR1 over-expression may promote osteosarcoma progression by conferring a more aggressive phenotype, and forming a more favorable microenvironment.",Journal Article,4525.0,38.0,Osteosarcoma common primary bone malignancy children associated rapid bone growth Parathyroid hormone-related peptide PTHrP signaling parathyroid hormone Type 1 receptor PTHR1 important skeletal development involved bone metastases aim investigate status PTHrP/PTHR1 possible role osteosarcoma preliminary screening higher level PTHR1 mRNA PTHrP 4 osteosarcoma xenografts compared 4 standard lines 5 patient derived lines p 0.05 quantitative RT-PCR extended 55 patient specimens significantly higher level PTHR1 mRNA detected metastatic relapsed primary sites p 0.01 behavior caused PTHR1 overexpression studied vitro PTHR1 transfected HOS line model Over-expression PHTR1 resulted increased proliferation motility Matrigel invasion addition exogenous PTHrP suggesting autocrine effect Importantly aggressiveness PTHR1-expressing completely reversed RNAi mediated knockdown addition PTHR1 over-expression led delayed osteoblastic differentiation upregulation involved extracellular matrix production TGF-beta1 connective tissue growth factor cocultured bone marrow derived monocytes PTHR1 transfected HOS induced greater number osteoclasts suggests PTHR1 over-expression promote osteosarcoma progression conferring aggressive phenotype forming favorable microenvironment,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[16, 3, 96, 186, 86, 710, 4, 541, 2, 16, 41, 5, 1321, 129, 785, 139, 1389, 13664, 314, 847, 785, 267, 14, 153, 22418, 16, 305, 9, 2621, 193, 2, 16, 646, 4, 196, 4, 127, 57, 3, 1130, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 963, 3, 156, 1, 13664, 22418, 2, 211, 899, 200, 4, 4, 8, 1676, 453, 8, 142, 301, 1, 22418, 956, 84, 44, 13664, 10, 204, 4, 39, 1348, 22, 72, 5, 39, 260, 31, 285, 15, 33, 69, 526, 31, 285, 19, 13, 474, 75, 1156, 240, 604, 192, 10, 673, 1747, 6, 614, 69, 623, 4, 92, 8, 97, 142, 301, 1, 22418, 956, 10, 530, 4, 113, 15, 591, 347, 76, 135, 29, 86, 633, 19, 13, 355, 31, 1710, 1546, 20, 22418, 851, 10, 195, 656, 4, 439, 75, 22418, 3245, 20554, 31, 328, 22, 8, 202, 252, 55, 1, 56181, 627, 4, 101, 457, 3603, 2, 7461, 578, 187, 352, 1, 4181, 13664, 802, 35, 5297, 254, 1859, 3, 3908, 4, 22418, 1046, 37, 10, 2500, 3682, 20, 5881, 517, 145, 1563, 4, 352, 22418, 252, 55, 836, 6, 1612, 7522, 910, 2, 2218, 1, 214, 646, 4, 1976, 2248, 1529, 225, 22, 2387, 5864, 2, 10990, 246, 129, 161, 198, 11444, 5, 581, 526, 5078, 22418, 3245, 20554, 37, 277, 8, 378, 207, 1, 9088, 26, 45, 844, 17, 22418, 252, 55, 68, 1617, 91, 20, 7209, 8, 80, 571, 1005, 2, 4525, 8, 80, 913, 995]",1591.0,17410535,Over-expression parathyroid hormone Type 1 receptor confers aggressive phenotype osteosarcoma,0,0.0

Successful palliation of hypercalcemia secondary to metastatic parathyroid cancer: an unusual indication for hepatic resection.,Journal of hepato-biliary-pancreatic surgery,J Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg,2007-07-30,"Primary carcinoma of the parathyroid gland is a rare disease. It is often diagnosed after recurrence of hyperparathyroidism following resection for presumed adenomatous disease. Local and distant recurrence is high and aggressive resection is advocated. Patients with parathyroid cancer are frequently plagued by severe hypercalcemia, which is often refractory to medical therapy. Herein we describe the case of a patient with metastatic parathyroid cancer localized to the liver.

Tumor expressed PTHrP facilitates prostate cancer-induced osteoblastic lesions.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2008-11-01,"Expression of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) correlates with prostate cancer skeletal progression; however, the impact of prostate cancer-derived PTHrP on the microenvironment and osteoblastic lesions in skeletal metastasis has not been completely elucidated. In this study, PTHrP overexpressing prostate cancer clones were stably established by transfection of full length rat PTHrP cDNA. Expression and secretion of PTHrP were verified by western blotting and IRMA assay. PTHrP overexpressing prostate cancer cells had higher growth rates in vitro, and generated larger tumors when inoculated subcutaneously into athymic mice. The impact of tumor-derived PTHrP on bone was investigated using a vossicle co-implant model. Histology revealed increased bone mass adjacent to PTHrP overexpressing tumor foci, with increased osteoblastogenesis, osteoclastogenesis and angiogenesis. In vitro analysis demonstrated pro-osteoclastic and pro-osteoblastic effects of PTHrP. PTHrP enhanced proliferation of bone marrow stromal cells and early osteoblast differentiation. PTHrP exerted a pro-angiogenic effect indirectly, as it increased angiogenesis but only in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells. These data suggest PTHrP plays a role in tumorigenesis in prostate cancer, and that PTHrP is a key mediator for communication and interactions between prostate cancer and the bone microenvironment.

A destructive cascade mediated by CCL2 facilitates prostate cancer growth in bone.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2009-01-27,"Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (CCL2) is a recently identified prominent regulator of prostate cancer growth and metastasis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanistic role of CCL2 in prostate cancer growth in bone. The present study found that CCL2 was up-regulated in osteoblasts (3-fold by PC-3 and 2-fold by VCaP conditioned medium) and endothelial cells (2-fold by PC-3 and VCaP conditioned medium). Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) treatment of osteoblastic cells up-regulated CCL2 and was blocked by a PTHrP antagonist, suggesting that prostate cancer-derived PTHrP plays an important role in elevation of osteoblast-derived CCL2. CCL2 indirectly increased blood vessel formation in endothelial cells through vascular endothelial growth factor-A, which was up-regulated 2-fold with administration of CCL2 in prostate cancer cells. In vivo, anti-CCL2 treatment suppressed tumor growth in bone. The decreased tumor burden was associated with decreased bone resorption (serum TRAP5b levels were decreased by 50-60% in anti-CCL2-treated animals from VCaP or PC-3 cell osseous lesions) and microvessel density was decreased by 70% in anti-CCL2-treated animals with bone lesions from VCaP cells. These data suggest that a destructive cascade is driven by tumor cell-derived, PTHrP-mediated induction of CCL2, which facilitates tumor growth via enhanced osteoclastic and endothelial cell activity in bone marrow. Taken together, CCL2 mediates the interaction between tumor-derived factors and host-derived chemokines acting in cooperation to promote skeletal metastasis.",Journal Article,4011.0,101.0,Monocyte chemoattractant 1 CCL2 recently identified prominent regulator prostate growth metastasis purpose investigate mechanistic role CCL2 prostate growth bone present CCL2 up-regulated osteoblasts 3-fold PC-3 2-fold VCaP conditioned medium endothelial 2-fold PC-3 VCaP conditioned medium Parathyroid hormone-related PTHrP treatment osteoblastic up-regulated CCL2 blocked PTHrP antagonist suggesting prostate cancer-derived PTHrP plays important role elevation osteoblast-derived CCL2 CCL2 indirectly increased blood vessel formation endothelial vascular endothelial growth factor-A up-regulated 2-fold administration CCL2 prostate vivo anti-CCL2 treatment suppressed growth bone decreased burden associated decreased bone resorption serum TRAP5b levels decreased 50-60 anti-CCL2-treated animals VCaP PC-3 osseous lesions microvessel density decreased 70 anti-CCL2-treated animals bone lesions VCaP suggest destructive cascade driven cell-derived PTHrP-mediated induction CCL2 facilitates growth enhanced osteoclastic endothelial activity bone marrow Taken CCL2 mediates interaction tumor-derived factors host-derived chemokines acting cooperation promote skeletal metastasis,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[5231, 12187, 178, 14, 4663, 16, 8, 761, 108, 3689, 2452, 1, 12, 129, 2, 278, 3, 743, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 963, 3, 2716, 200, 1, 4663, 4, 12, 129, 4, 3, 364, 45, 204, 17, 4663, 10, 126, 1065, 4, 5965, 27, 1116, 20, 1341, 27, 2, 18, 1116, 20, 10298, 5636, 3759, 2, 845, 37, 18, 1116, 20, 1341, 27, 2, 10298, 5636, 3759, 785, 139, 178, 13664, 24, 1, 7522, 37, 126, 1065, 4663, 2, 10, 2582, 20, 8, 13664, 3137, 802, 17, 12, 526, 13664, 1698, 35, 305, 200, 4, 3292, 1, 7418, 526, 4663, 4663, 7792, 101, 315, 3685, 1264, 4, 845, 37, 298, 756, 845, 129, 161, 8, 92, 10, 126, 1065, 18, 1116, 5, 634, 1, 4663, 4, 12, 37, 4, 386, 312, 4663, 24, 1908, 30, 129, 4, 3, 340, 30, 892, 10, 41, 5, 340, 8143, 524, 38909, 148, 11, 340, 20, 212, 335, 4, 312, 4663, 73, 2258, 29, 10298, 15, 1341, 27, 31, 5230, 406, 2, 4269, 1263, 10, 340, 20, 431, 4, 312, 4663, 73, 2258, 5, 406, 29, 10298, 37, 46, 74, 309, 17, 8, 11122, 4678, 16, 1621, 20, 30, 31, 526, 13664, 517, 504, 1, 4663, 92, 4936, 30, 129, 847, 651, 18462, 2, 845, 31, 128, 4, 581, 1633, 1162, 4663, 3961, 3, 915, 59, 30, 526, 130, 2, 1204, 526, 4906, 5375, 4, 8323, 6, 1617, 2621, 278]",1503.0,19176388,destructive cascade mediated CCL2 facilitates prostate growth bone,0,0.0

The fallen one: the inferior parathyroid gland that descends into the mediastinum.,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,J. Am. Coll. Surg.,2009-05-01,"Inferior parathyroid glands are located along the embryologic migration path of the thymus and can rest in the thyrothymic ligament or anterior mediastinum. Our nomenclature system designates these glands as ""fallen"" (type F) glands. This study reviews our experience with type F parathyroid glands to determine which can be retrieved successfully through a cervical incision. A retrospective review of patients who underwent parathyroidectomy between June 1998 and May 2008 was performed. Patient demographics, localization studies, and operative and pathologic reports were analyzed. Distance from the superior aspect of the clavicle to the target parathyroid gland was measured. Sixty (9.2%) patients had a type F parathyroid gland. Parathyroidectomy was performed through cervical incision in 54 (90%) patients and 6 (10%) required a thoracic approach. Preoperative imaging identified parathyroid glands located >or=6 cm below the superior aspect of the clavicle in eight patients. Of these, six (75%) required a thoracic approach and two (25%) were resected through a cervical incision with concomitant thymectomy. Parathyroidectomy was successfully performed through a cervical incision in all 52 (100%) patients in whom the target parathyroid gland was <6 cm below the superior aspect of the clavicle (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.001). A cervical approach allows successful retrieval of type F parathyroid glands located <6 cm below the superior aspect of the head of the clavicle in the anterior mediastinum.

Endoscopic hemithyroidectomy with prophylactic ipsilateral central neck dissection via an unilateral axillo-breast approach without gas insufflation for unilateral micropapillary thyroid carcinoma: preliminary report.,Surgical endoscopy,Surg Endosc,2009-08-18,"Recently, various endoscopic approaches have been applied to thyroid surgery. However, few specific data exist on endoscopic thyroidectomy with central neck dissection (CND) for micropapillary thyroid carcinoma. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of endoscopic hemithyroidectomy (HT) plus CND. In this study, 29 consecutive patients underwent endoscopic HT with ipsilateral CND via a unilateral axillo-breast approach (endo group), and 30 matched control patients underwent conventional open HT with ipsilateral CND (open group). The following variables were compared between these two groups: perioperative complications, surgery-related outcomes, and pathologic outcomes. The operating time in the endo group was longer than in the open group (p = 0.012). In terms of parathyroid gland (PTG) preservation, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. The mean numbers of dissected central lymph nodes and metastatic central lymph nodes were similar in the two groups (p = 0.506 vs. 0.975). The endo group had a significantly longer mean hospital stay (6.21 +/- 0.94 days) than the open group (4.30 +/- 1.02 days; p = 0.000). No significant difference was observed in the overall perioperative complications between the two groups. This study demonstrates that the endoscopic approach of CND plus HT is feasible for selected unilateral, intrathyroidal, micropapillary carcinomas. In the future, prospective and comparative studies on the surgical techniques of total thyroidectomy and CND are needed to verify their oncologic safety.",Comparative Study,3808.0,38.0,Recently endoscopic approaches applied thyroid surgery specific exist endoscopic thyroidectomy central neck dissection CND micropapillary thyroid carcinoma aimed evaluate feasibility safety endoscopic hemithyroidectomy HT plus CND 29 consecutive patients underwent endoscopic HT ipsilateral CND unilateral axillo-breast approach endo group 30 matched control patients underwent conventional open HT ipsilateral CND open group following variables compared groups perioperative complications surgery-related outcomes pathologic outcomes operating time endo group longer open group p 0.012 terms parathyroid gland PTG preservation statistically significant differences groups mean numbers dissected central lymph nodes metastatic central lymph nodes similar groups p 0.506 vs. 0.975 endo group significantly longer mean hospital stay 6.21 +/- 0.94 days open group 4.30 +/- 1.02 days p 0.000 significant difference observed overall perioperative complications groups demonstrates endoscopic approach CND plus HT feasible selected unilateral intrathyroidal micropapillary carcinomas future prospective comparative studies surgical techniques total thyroidectomy CND needed verify oncologic safety,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[761, 747, 2056, 611, 47, 85, 1498, 6, 152, 137, 1021, 112, 74, 1923, 23, 2056, 5949, 5, 854, 1161, 14287, 9, 6027, 134, 26, 45, 1295, 6, 376, 3, 1437, 2, 367, 1, 2056, 38649, 3152, 349, 14287, 4, 26, 45, 462, 935, 7, 208, 2056, 3152, 5, 2880, 14287, 847, 8, 3208, 58172, 1678, 353, 10037, 87, 2, 201, 655, 182, 7, 208, 809, 1020, 3152, 5, 2880, 14287, 1020, 87, 3, 366, 682, 11, 72, 59, 46, 100, 271, 1547, 521, 152, 139, 123, 2, 510, 123, 3, 2584, 98, 4, 3, 10037, 87, 10, 589, 76, 4, 3, 1020, 87, 19, 13, 3499, 4, 1794, 1, 2326, 14331, 2224, 125, 11, 77, 712, 93, 362, 59, 3, 100, 271, 3, 313, 1870, 1, 7973, 854, 263, 502, 2, 113, 854, 263, 502, 11, 288, 4, 3, 100, 271, 19, 13, 9454, 105, 13, 16842, 3, 10037, 87, 42, 8, 97, 589, 313, 702, 2020, 49, 239, 13, 960, 162, 76, 3, 1020, 87, 39, 201, 14, 588, 162, 19, 13, 984, 77, 93, 523, 10, 164, 4, 3, 63, 1547, 521, 59, 3, 100, 271, 26, 45, 1902, 17, 3, 2056, 353, 1, 14287, 349, 3152, 16, 1313, 9, 715, 3208, 26765, 6027, 826, 4, 3, 508, 482, 2, 2352, 94, 23, 3, 221, 1092, 1, 181, 5949, 2, 14287, 32, 575, 6, 6355, 136, 1998, 367]",1505.0,19688395,Endoscopic hemithyroidectomy prophylactic ipsilateral central neck dissection unilateral axillo-breast approach gas insufflation unilateral micropapillary thyroid carcinoma preliminary report,0,0.0
Future directions of bone-targeted therapy for metastatic breast cancer.,Nature reviews. Clinical oncology,Nat Rev Clin Oncol,2010-08-31,"Bone is the most common metastatic site for breast cancer, and bone metastases can cause pain as well as risk of pathological fractures. Emerging treatments for metastatic bone disease have arisen from advances in our understanding of the unique cellular and molecular mechanisms that contribute to bone metastasis. The interaction between tumor cells and the bone microenvironment results in a 'vicious cycle' that increases both bone destruction and tumor burden. The tumor secretes factors, such as parathyroid hormone-related peptide, that stimulate osteoclastogenesis. Similarly, the bone stroma produces growth factors, such as transforming growth factor β, that promote tumor growth in bone. Therapeutic targeting of these microenvironmental factors is under intensive investigation. Other attractive therapeutic targets include signaling molecules, such as receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand, Src kinase, and cathepsin K, all of which regulate osteoclast function, and chemokine receptor 4, which is involved in the homing of tumor cells to bone. In this Review, we describe the progress and future directions of novel bone-targeted therapies that may reduce or prevent destructive bone metastasis from breast cancer. Novel modalities for predicting and monitoring treatment response will also be described.",Journal Article,3430.0,68.0,Bone common metastatic site breast bone metastases cause pain risk pathological fractures Emerging treatments metastatic bone disease arisen advances understanding unique cellular molecular mechanisms contribute bone metastasis interaction bone microenvironment 'vicious cycle increases bone destruction burden secretes factors parathyroid hormone-related peptide stimulate osteoclastogenesis Similarly bone stroma produces growth factors transforming growth factor promote growth bone Therapeutic targeting microenvironmental factors intensive investigation attractive therapeutic targets include signaling molecules receptor activator nuclear factor κB ligand Src kinase cathepsin K regulate osteoclast function chemokine receptor 4 involved homing bone Review progress future directions novel bone-targeted therapies reduce prevent destructive bone metastasis breast Novel modalities predicting monitoring treatment response described,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[16, 3, 96, 186, 113, 606, 9, 12, 2, 196, 122, 708, 559, 22, 149, 22, 43, 1, 1301, 3909, 1478, 640, 9, 113, 34, 47, 14255, 29, 954, 4, 114, 612, 1, 3, 991, 763, 2, 219, 483, 17, 1248, 6, 278, 3, 915, 59, 30, 37, 2, 3, 995, 99, 4, 8, 59297, 417, 17, 1106, 110, 4572, 2, 30, 892, 3, 30, 28940, 130, 225, 22, 785, 139, 1389, 17, 4223, 13889, 1813, 3, 2477, 4042, 129, 130, 225, 22, 3621, 129, 161, 17, 1617, 30, 129, 4, 189, 529, 1, 46, 9300, 130, 16, 669, 1686, 940, 127, 3059, 189, 637, 643, 314, 1598, 225, 22, 153, 3393, 1, 928, 161, 2448, 1232, 2023, 216, 2, 7892, 1634, 62, 1, 92, 2288, 6382, 343, 2, 3596, 153, 39, 92, 16, 646, 4, 3, 5515, 1, 30, 37, 6, 4, 26, 206, 21, 897, 3, 1466, 2, 508, 3540, 1, 229, 3417, 238, 235, 17, 68, 969, 15, 1682, 11122, 278, 29, 12, 229, 1558, 9, 1434, 2, 1315, 24, 51, 303, 120, 40, 1027]",1226.0,20808302,Future directions bone-targeted therapy metastatic breast,1,0.02564102564102564
Macrophages induce neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer cells via BMP6-IL6 Loop.,The Prostate,Prostate,2011-03-03,"Frequently associated with hormone refractory prostate cancer are neuroendocrine cells. Because these cells do not express androgen receptors and are castration-resistant, further understanding the mechanism of neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) of prostate cancer cells may yield novel intervention methods in hormone refractory prostate cancer. In this regard, the present study investigated the effect of macrophages on prostate cancer NED. THP-1 and LNCaP or RAW264.7 and TRAMP-C2 cell line co-cultures were used to investigate NED-macrophage interactions. Also interleukin-6 (IL-6) knockout mice and macrophage-depleted mice were used to test NED in vivo. We found that co-culturing with THP-1 human monocytic cell line and RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cell line led to the NED of LNCaP and TRAMP-C2 prostate cancer cells, respectively. Specifically, the conditioned media of activated macrophages stimulated the expression of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), a marker of NED, in both LNCaP and TRAMP-C2 cells. Mechanistically, bone morphogenetic protein-6 (BMP-6) derived from prostate cancer cells increased the expression of IL-6 in macrophages. Subsequently, IL-6 induced the NED of prostate cancer cells. When this feedback loop was disrupted with neutralizing antibodies to either BMP-6 or IL-6, NED was no longer observed.

Differential regulation of myeloid leukemias by the bone marrow microenvironment.,Nature medicine,Nat. Med.,2013-10-27,"Like their normal hematopoietic stem cell counterparts, leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are presumed to reside in specific niches in the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) and may be the cause of relapse following chemotherapy. Targeting the niche is a new strategy to eliminate persistent and drug-resistant LSCs. CD44 (refs. 3,4) and interleukin-6 (ref. 5) have been implicated previously in the LSC niche. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is released during bone remodeling and plays a part in maintenance of CML LSCs, but a role for TGF-β1 from the BMM has not been defined. Here, we show that alteration of the BMM by osteoblastic cell-specific activation of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptor attenuates BCR-ABL1 oncogene-induced CML-like myeloproliferative neoplasia (MPN) but enhances MLL-AF9 oncogene-induced AML in mouse transplantation models, possibly through opposing effects of increased TGF-β1 on the respective LSCs. PTH treatment caused a 15-fold decrease in LSCs in wild-type mice with CML-like MPN and reduced engraftment of immune-deficient mice with primary human CML cells. These results demonstrate that LSC niches in CML and AML are distinct and suggest that modulation of the BMM by PTH may be a feasible strategy to reduce LSCs, a prerequisite for the cure of CML.

In Step A, patients received oral LR-103 once daily in 14-day cycles with intra-patient dose escalation per accelerated dose escalation design. Dose limiting toxicity for Step A was defined as ≥grade 2 hypercalcemia and/or >grade 2 other toxicities. Starting dose was 5 µg/day. Step B used a 3+3 design starting at Step A maximum tolerated dose with 28-day cycles. Dose limiting toxicity was defined as ≥grade 3 hypercalcemia or any grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity, except hypercalciuria. Twenty-one patients were enrolled; eight were treated in Step A. At dose level 3 (15 µg/day), two patients had dose limiting toxicity. One had grade 4 hyperuricemia. The other had grade 4 GGT plus grade 3 alkaline phosphatase, fatigue and urinary tract infection (UTI). Dose level 2 (10 µg/day) was the maximum tolerated dose for Step A and was starting dose for Step B. The dose was escalated to dose level 5 (30 µg/day) with a patient experiencing grade 3 dose limiting toxicity of hypercalcemia. The study was discontinued before reaching the maximum tolerated dose due to sponsor decision. Modest increases in serum osteocalcin and calcium and decrease in parathyroid hormone were noted. Best response was stable disease; four patients were on therapy for six months or longer. Step A dose limiting toxicities limited accelerated dose escalation.

Phase I trial of valproic acid and lenalidomide in patients with advanced cancer.,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol.,2015-02-10,"The objectives of this study were to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of valproic acid (VPA) and lenalidomide. In this 3+3 design study, VPA was administered daily on a 7-day-on, 7-day-off schedule, and lenalidomide was administered daily for 28 days. Because of the response noted during the dose-escalation phase, 12 additional patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) received the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in a dose-expansion phase. Twenty-six patients with advanced cancer (14 men/12 women), median age of 56 years (range 38-70 years), and a median number of two prior therapies (range 0-12) were enrolled. The most common toxicities were fatigue, rash, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and change in mental status. Dose-limiting toxic (DLT) effects were grade III confusion (n = 3), somnolence (n = 1), and gait disturbance (n = 1). The MTD was reached at VPA 30 mg/kg and lenalidomide 25 mg. Although only two of the 12 patients from the dose-expansion phase had DLT during the first cycle at the MTD, during subsequent cycles the majority of patients required dose reduction of VPA to 5-20 mg/kg because of fatigue and drowsiness. No significant tumor reductions were noticed in patients with ACC, but seven of these patients had stable disease over four cycles.

Follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer.,Nature reviews. Disease primers,Nat Rev Dis Primers,2015-12-10,"Follicular cell-derived thyroid cancers are derived from the follicular cells in the thyroid gland, which secrete the iodine-containing thyroid hormones. Follicular cell-derived thyroid cancers can be classified into papillary thyroid cancer (80-85%), follicular thyroid cancer (10-15%), poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (<2%) and undifferentiated (anaplastic) thyroid cancer (<2%), and these have an excellent prognosis with the exception of undifferentiated thyroid cancer. The advent and expansion of advanced diagnostic techniques has driven and continues to drive the epidemic of occult papillary thyroid cancer, owing to overdiagnosis of clinically irrelevant nodules. This transformation of the thyroid cancer landscape at molecular and clinical levels calls for the modification of management strategies towards personalized medicine based on individual risk assessment to deliver the most effective but least aggressive treatment. In thyroid cancer surgery, for instance, injuries to structures outside the thyroid gland, such as the recurrent laryngeal nerve in 2-5% of surgeries or the parathyroid glands in 5-10% of surgeries, negatively affect quality of life more than loss of the expendable thyroid gland. Furthermore, the risks associated with radioiodine ablation may outweigh the risks of persistent or recurrent disease and disease-specific mortality. Improvement in the health-related quality of life of survivors of follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer, which is decreased despite the generally favourable outcome, hinges on early tumour detection and minimization of treatment-related sequelae. Future opportunities include more widespread adoption of molecular and clinical risk stratification and identification of actionable targets for individualized therapies.",Journal Article,1503.0,22.0,Follicular cell-derived thyroid derived follicular thyroid gland secrete iodine-containing thyroid hormones Follicular cell-derived thyroid classified papillary thyroid 80-85 follicular thyroid 10-15 poorly differentiated thyroid 2 undifferentiated anaplastic thyroid 2 excellent prognosis exception undifferentiated thyroid advent expansion advanced diagnostic techniques driven continues drive epidemic occult papillary thyroid owing overdiagnosis clinically irrelevant nodules transformation thyroid landscape molecular clinical levels calls modification management strategies personalized medicine based individual risk assessment deliver effective aggressive treatment thyroid surgery instance injuries structures outside thyroid gland recurrent laryngeal nerve 2-5 surgeries parathyroid glands 5-10 surgeries negatively affect quality life loss expendable thyroid gland Furthermore risks associated radioiodine ablation outweigh risks persistent recurrent disease disease-specific mortality Improvement health-related quality life survivors follicular cell-derived thyroid decreased despite generally favourable outcome hinges early tumour detection minimization treatment-related sequelae Future opportunities include widespread adoption molecular clinical risk stratification identification actionable targets individualized therapies,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[1974, 31, 526, 163, 32, 526, 29, 3, 1974, 37, 4, 3, 2326, 92, 6401, 3, 4287, 1101, 4927, 1974, 31, 526, 163, 122, 40, 1373, 237, 1796, 12, 493, 772, 1974, 12, 79, 167, 1240, 1442, 12, 18, 2, 4480, 1841, 12, 18, 2, 46, 47, 35, 1503, 356, 5, 3, 4188, 1, 4480, 12, 3, 4114, 2, 1422, 1, 131, 752, 1092, 71, 1621, 2, 2274, 6, 3279, 3, 12515, 1, 2879, 1796, 12, 3421, 6, 10700, 1, 505, 20237, 2597, 26, 1392, 1, 3, 12, 2801, 28, 219, 2, 38, 148, 6467, 9, 3, 2437, 1, 284, 422, 3113, 2175, 1807, 90, 23, 797, 43, 455, 6, 3392, 3, 96, 323, 84, 506, 571, 24, 4, 12, 152, 9, 10642, 13063, 6, 2414, 2513, 3, 2326, 225, 22, 3, 387, 2476, 4, 18, 33, 1, 5305, 15, 3, 3966, 4, 33, 79, 1, 5305, 2723, 1158, 372, 1, 358, 80, 76, 407, 1, 3, 68191, 2326, 798, 3, 1098, 41, 5, 7211, 1650, 68, 11592, 3, 1098, 1, 1882, 15, 387, 34, 2, 34, 112, 282, 767, 4, 3, 341, 139, 372, 1, 358, 1, 332, 1, 1974, 31, 526, 12, 92, 16, 340, 550, 3, 1228, 6816, 228, 39232, 23, 191, 770, 638, 2, 12807, 1, 24, 139, 4156, 508, 2605, 643, 80, 3029, 4350, 1, 219, 2, 38, 43, 1541, 2, 911, 1, 2856, 637, 9, 2596, 235]",1613.0,27188261,Follicular cell-derived thyroid,0,0.0

4D-CT is Superior to Ultrasound and Sestamibi for Localizing Recurrent Parathyroid Disease.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2018-02-26,"Recurrent primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) presents a diagnostic challenge in localizing a hyperfunctioning gland. Although several imaging modalities are available for preoperative localization, 4D-CT is increasingly utilized for its ability to locate both smaller and previously unlocalized lesions. Currently, there is a paucity of data evaluating the utility of 4D-CT in the reoperative setting compared with ultrasound (US) and sestamibi. We aimed to determine the sensitivity of 4D-CT in localizing parathyroid adenomas in recurrent or persistent PHPT. We performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected data from a tertiary-care hospital, and identified 58 patients who received preoperative 4D-CT with US and/or sestamibi between May 2008 and March 2016. Data regarding the size, shape, and number of parathyroid lesions were collected for each patient. A total of 62 lesions were identified intraoperatively among the 58 patients (6 with multigland disease) included in this investigation. 4D-CT missed 13 lesions identified intraoperatively, compared with 32 and 22 lesions missed by US and sestamibi, respectively.

Defining Survivorship Trajectories Across Patients With Solid Tumors: An Evidence-Based Approach.,JAMA oncology,JAMA Oncol,2018-11-01,"Survivorship involves a multidisciplinary approach to surveillance and management of comorbidities and secondary cancers, overseen by oncologists, surgeons, and primary care physicians. Optimal timing and coordination of care, however, is unclear and often based on arbitrary 5-year cutoffs. To determine high- and low-risk periods for all tumor types that could define when survivorship care might best be overseen by oncologists and when to transition to primary care physicians. In this pan-cancer, longitudinal, observational study, excess mortality hazard, calculated as an annualized mortality risk above a baseline population, was plotted over time. The time this hazard took to stabilize defined a high-risk period. The percent morality elevation above age- and sex-matched controls in the latter low-risk period was reported as a mortality gap. The US population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database defined the cancer population, and the US Census life tables defined controls. Incident cases of patients with cancer were separated into tumor types based on International Classification of Diseases for Oncology definitions. Population-level data on incident cancer cases was compared with the general US population. Overall mortality and cause of death were reported on observed cancer cases. A total of 2 317 185 patients (median age, 63 years; 49.8% female) with 66 primary tumor types were evaluated. High-risk surveillance period durations ranged from less than 1 year (breast, prostate, lip, ocular, and parathyroid cancers) up to 19 years (unspecified gastrointestinal cancers). The annualized mortality gap, representing the excess mortality in the stable period, ranged from a median 0.26% to 9.33% excess annual mortality (thyroid and hypopharyngeal cancer populations, respectively). Cluster analysis produced 6 risk cluster groups: group 1, with median survival of 16.2 (5th to 95th percentile range [PR], 10.7-40.2) years and median high-risk period of 2.5 (PR, 0-5.0) years; group 2, 8.3 (PR, 5.1-23.3) and 2.5 (PR, 4.0-8.0) years; group 3, 2.8 (PR, 1.4-3.7) and 7.0 (PR, 6.0-11.1) years; group 4, 1.6 (PR, 1.5-1.8) and 6.0 (PR, 5.1-11.4) years; group 5, 0.8 (PR, 0.5-1.2) and 0.8 (PR, 0.5-1.2) years; and group 6, 0.5 (PR, 0.4-0.8) and 12.0 (PR, 9.3-12.9) years, respectively. Subanalyses of selected tumor types in these groups revealed that stratifying on stage and histologic type can change the risk cluster and guidance for care. These findings indicate that a standardized 5-year surveillance period is inadequate for some cancers while excessive for others. High-risk cancers require the most resources with the longest high-risk period, highest persistent baseline mortality risk, and longest period of primary cancer mortality, all arguing for longer follow-up with an oncologist in these cancers.",Journal Article,446.0,5.0,Survivorship involves multidisciplinary approach surveillance management comorbidities secondary overseen oncologists surgeons primary care physicians Optimal timing coordination care unclear based arbitrary 5-year cutoffs determine high- low-risk periods types define survivorship care best overseen oncologists transition primary care physicians pan-cancer longitudinal observational excess mortality hazard calculated annualized mortality risk baseline population plotted time time hazard took stabilize defined high-risk period percent morality elevation age- sex-matched controls low-risk period reported mortality gap population-based Surveillance Epidemiology End database defined population Census life defined controls Incident cases patients separated types based International Classification Diseases Oncology definitions Population-level incident cases compared general population Overall mortality cause death reported observed cases total 2 317 185 patients median age 63 years 49.8 female 66 primary types evaluated High-risk surveillance period durations ranged 1 year breast prostate lip ocular parathyroid 19 years unspecified gastrointestinal annualized mortality gap representing excess mortality stable period ranged median 0.26 9.33 excess annual mortality thyroid hypopharyngeal populations respectively Cluster produced 6 risk cluster groups group 1 median survival 16.2 5th 95th percentile range PR 10.7-40.2 years median high-risk period 2.5 PR 0-5.0 years group 2 8.3 PR 5.1-23.3 2.5 PR 4.0-8.0 years group 3 2.8 PR 1.4-3.7 7.0 PR 6.0-11.1 years group 4 1.6 PR 1.5-1.8 6.0 PR 5.1-11.4 years group 5 0.8 PR 0.5-1.2 0.8 PR 0.5-1.2 years group 6 0.5 PR 0.4-0.8 12.0 PR 9.3-12.9 years respectively Subanalyses selected types groups revealed stratifying stage histologic type change risk cluster guidance care findings indicate standardized 5-year surveillance period inadequate excessive High-risk require resources longest high-risk period highest persistent baseline mortality risk longest period primary mortality arguing longer follow-up oncologist,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[2560, 2921, 8, 1643, 353, 6, 617, 2, 284, 1, 1909, 2, 568, 163, 37607, 20, 1339, 1613, 2, 86, 165, 1261, 665, 1972, 2, 6373, 1, 165, 137, 16, 1200, 2, 629, 90, 23, 16183, 33, 111, 8339, 6, 223, 64, 2, 154, 43, 3338, 9, 62, 30, 630, 17, 359, 1107, 198, 2560, 165, 822, 824, 40, 37607, 20, 1339, 2, 198, 6, 1970, 6, 86, 165, 1261, 4, 26, 3055, 12, 2380, 2495, 45, 2612, 282, 360, 981, 22, 35, 18519, 282, 43, 2090, 8, 330, 266, 10, 14997, 252, 98, 3, 98, 26, 360, 5060, 6, 10863, 395, 8, 64, 43, 727, 3, 714, 39864, 3292, 2090, 89, 2, 1035, 655, 535, 4, 3, 3286, 154, 43, 727, 10, 210, 22, 8, 282, 5285, 3, 843, 266, 90, 617, 1284, 2, 396, 99, 609, 395, 3, 12, 266, 2, 3, 843, 7319, 358, 9941, 395, 535, 2631, 140, 1, 7, 5, 12, 11, 4910, 237, 30, 630, 90, 23, 944, 947, 1, 1342, 9, 413, 3833, 266, 301, 74, 23, 2631, 12, 140, 10, 72, 5, 3, 1083, 843, 266, 63, 282, 2, 708, 1, 273, 11, 210, 23, 164, 12, 140, 8, 181, 1, 18, 7869, 5805, 7, 52, 89, 676, 60, 739, 66, 1061, 5, 700, 86, 30, 630, 11, 194, 64, 43, 617, 727, 4864, 1869, 29, 299, 76, 14, 111, 13489, 4345, 2, 163, 126, 6, 326, 60, 12288, 163, 3, 18519, 282, 5285, 2861, 3, 2612, 282, 4, 3, 585, 727, 1869, 29, 8, 52, 13, 432, 6, 83, 466, 2612, 2114, 282, 2, 12, 1184, 106, 3132, 65, 1687, 49, 43, 3132, 271, 87, 14, 5, 52, 25, 1, 245, 18, 13570, 6, 14610, 6392, 184, 998, 79, 67, 327, 18, 60, 2, 52, 64, 43, 727, 1, 18, 33, 998, 13, 33, 13, 60, 87, 18, 66, 27, 998, 33, 14, 382, 27, 2, 18, 33, 998, 39, 13, 66, 13, 60, 87, 27, 18, 66, 998, 14, 39, 27, 67, 2, 67, 13, 998, 49, 13, 175, 14, 60, 87, 39, 14, 49, 998, 14, 33, 14, 66, 2, 49, 13, 998, 33, 14, 175, 39, 60, 87, 33, 13, 66, 998, 13, 33, 14, 18, 2, 13, 66, 998, 13, 33, 14, 18, 60, 2, 87, 49, 13, 33, 998, 13, 39, 13, 66, 2, 133, 13, 998, 83, 27, 133, 83, 60, 106, 29173, 1, 715, 30, 630, 4, 46, 271, 553, 17, 5035, 23, 82, 2, 884, 267, 122, 707, 3, 43, 3132, 2, 2753, 9, 165, 46, 272, 1008, 17, 8, 1670, 33, 111, 617, 727, 16, 3358, 9, 476, 163, 369, 4529, 9, 1749, 64, 43, 163, 1353, 3, 96, 2892, 5, 3, 5683, 64, 43, 727, 1076, 1882, 330, 282, 43, 2, 5683, 727, 1, 86, 12, 282, 62, 13009, 9, 589, 166, 126, 5, 35, 2709, 4, 46, 163]",2681.0,29860375,Defining Survivorship Trajectories Patients Solid Evidence-Based Approach,0,0.0
