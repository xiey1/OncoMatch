Genotype-phenotype analysis in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.,"Archives of surgery (Chicago, Ill. : 1960)",Arch Surg,2002-06-01,"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline mutations in the MEN1 gene and characterized by multiple endocrine tumors, most notably in the parathyroid glands, pituitary, and pancreas. The syndrome demonstrates variable expressivity and considerable genetic heterogeneity. Patient data were examined for possible associations between genotype and phenotype. We reviewed recorded medical data from 1975 to 2001 on patients with MEN 1 and compared specific types and locations of MEN1 gene mutations with manifestations of the syndrome. We identified 109 affected patients from 24 MEN 1 kindreds. The phenotypic expression of MEN 1 in affected individuals included hyperparathyroidism in 74%, pancreatic endocrine tumors in 51%, and pituitary tumors in 35%. Twelve of 14 insulinomas occurred in patients with pituitary tumors. Mutation analysis was completed in 14 of 24 kindreds (80 of the 109 patients). Mutations were most common in exons 2 (31%), 9 (15%), and 10 (23%). All 21 patients with frameshift mutations (and known pancreatic endocrine tumor status) had such tumors. Pituitary tumors were associated with frameshift mutations in exon 2. The type and location of MEN1 mutations may be associated with the phenotypic expression of specific tumors. Such information may assist in the genetic counseling and surveillance of at-risk patients. A specific genotype-phenotype correlation is unlikely because of the heterogeneity of the mutations in the MEN1 gene.",Journal Article,6443.0,,Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 MEN 1 syndrome autosomal dominant disorder caused germline MEN1 characterized multiple endocrine notably parathyroid glands pituitary pancreas syndrome demonstrates variable expressivity considerable genetic heterogeneity Patient examined possible associations genotype phenotype reviewed recorded medical 1975 2001 patients MEN 1 compared specific types locations MEN1 manifestations syndrome identified 109 affected patients 24 MEN 1 kindreds phenotypic expression MEN 1 affected individuals included hyperparathyroidism 74 pancreatic endocrine 51 pituitary 35 14 insulinomas occurred patients pituitary completed 14 24 kindreds 80 109 patients common exons 2 31 9 15 10 23 21 patients frameshift known pancreatic endocrine status Pituitary associated frameshift exon 2 type location MEN1 associated phenotypic expression specific information assist genetic counseling surveillance at-risk patients specific genotype-phenotype correlation unlikely heterogeneity MEN1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[232, 1293, 2298, 267, 14, 325, 14, 681, 16, 35, 6084, 2156, 2645, 1546, 20, 1009, 138, 4, 3, 7923, 145, 2, 765, 20, 232, 1293, 57, 96, 2552, 4, 3, 3966, 2, 3, 681, 1902, 1347, 42949, 2, 2658, 336, 1144, 69, 74, 11, 409, 9, 899, 685, 59, 1183, 2, 1005, 21, 446, 1872, 484, 74, 29, 7585, 6, 1758, 23, 7, 5, 325, 14, 2, 72, 112, 630, 2, 4069, 1, 7923, 145, 138, 5, 4282, 1, 3, 681, 21, 108, 3486, 1424, 7, 29, 259, 325, 14, 10141, 3, 3290, 55, 1, 325, 14, 4, 1424, 869, 159, 9630, 4, 794, 1293, 57, 4, 725, 2, 57, 4, 465, 2544, 1, 213, 24465, 489, 4, 7, 5, 57, 258, 65, 10, 781, 4, 213, 1, 259, 10141, 493, 1, 3, 3486, 7, 138, 11, 96, 186, 4, 3885, 18, 456, 83, 167, 2, 79, 382, 62, 239, 7, 5, 9425, 138, 2, 440, 1293, 30, 156, 42, 225, 57, 57, 11, 41, 5, 9425, 138, 4, 1725, 18, 3, 267, 2, 1147, 1, 7923, 138, 68, 40, 41, 5, 3, 3290, 55, 1, 112, 57, 225, 487, 68, 3425, 4, 3, 336, 2011, 2, 617, 1, 28, 43, 7, 8, 112, 1183, 1005, 816, 16, 3568, 408, 1, 3, 1144, 1, 3, 138, 4, 3, 7923, 145]",1404.0,12049533,Genotype-phenotype multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1,0,0.0
Preirradiation endocrinopathies in pediatric brain tumor patients determined by dynamic tests of endocrine function.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2002-09-01,"To prospectively evaluate pediatric patients with localized primary brain tumors for evidence of endocrinopathy before radiotherapy (RT). Seventy-five pediatric patients were evaluated with the arginine tolerance test and L-dopa test for growth hormone secretory capacity and activity; thyroid-stimulating hormone surge and thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test for the hypothalamic-thyroid axis; the 1-microg adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) and metyrapone test for ACTH reserve; and, depending on age, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test to determine gonadotropin response. The study included 38 male and 37 female patients, age 1-21 years with ependymoma (n = 35), World Health Organization (WHO) Grade I-II astrocytoma (n = 18), WHO Grade III-IV astrocytoma (n = 10), craniopharyngioma (n = 7), optic pathway tumor (n = 4), and germinoma (n = 1). Seven patients receiving dexamethasone at the time of the evaluation were excluded from the final analysis. Of 68 assessable patient, 45 (66%) had evidence of endocrinopathy before RT, including 15 of 32 patients (47%) with posterior fossa tumors. Of the 45 patients, 38% had growth hormone deficiency, 43% had thyroid-stimulating hormone secretion abnormality, 22% had an abnormality in ACTH reserve, and 13% had an abnormality in age-dependent gonadotropin secretion. The incidence of pre-RT endocrinopathy in pediatric brain tumor patients is high, including patients with tumors not adjacent to the hypothalamic-pituitary unit. These data suggest an overestimation in the incidence of radiation-induced endocrinopathy. Baseline endocrine function should be determined for brain tumor patients before therapy. The potential for radiation-induced endocrinopathy alone cannot be used as an argument for alternatives to RT for most patients. Pre-RT endocrinopathy may be an early indicator of central nervous system damage that will influence the functional outcome unrelated to RT.",Journal Article,6351.0,63.0,prospectively evaluate pediatric patients localized primary brain evidence endocrinopathy radiotherapy RT Seventy-five pediatric patients evaluated arginine tolerance test L-dopa test growth hormone secretory capacity activity thyroid-stimulating hormone surge thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test hypothalamic-thyroid axis 1-microg adrenocorticotropin hormone ACTH metyrapone test ACTH reserve depending age gonadotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test determine gonadotropin response included 38 male 37 female patients age 1-21 years ependymoma n 35 World Health Organization Grade I-II astrocytoma n 18 Grade III-IV astrocytoma n 10 craniopharyngioma n 7 optic pathway n 4 germinoma n 1 Seven patients receiving dexamethasone time evaluation excluded final 68 assessable patient 45 66 evidence endocrinopathy RT including 15 32 patients 47 posterior fossa 45 patients 38 growth hormone deficiency 43 thyroid-stimulating hormone secretion abnormality 22 abnormality ACTH reserve 13 abnormality age-dependent gonadotropin secretion incidence pre-RT endocrinopathy pediatric brain patients high including patients adjacent hypothalamic-pituitary unit suggest overestimation incidence radiation-induced endocrinopathy Baseline endocrine function determined brain patients therapy potential radiation-induced endocrinopathy argument alternatives RT patients Pre-RT endocrinopathy early indicator central nervous damage influence functional outcome unrelated RT,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[6, 1143, 376, 815, 7, 5, 909, 86, 342, 57, 9, 241, 1, 13011, 348, 310, 240, 2073, 365, 815, 7, 11, 194, 5, 3, 5392, 2614, 412, 2, 805, 27876, 412, 9, 129, 785, 7106, 2162, 2, 128, 11260, 2122, 785, 15515, 2, 16665, 5586, 785, 2503, 412, 9, 3, 7531, 11260, 2310, 3, 14, 2440, 30299, 785, 14784, 2, 43016, 412, 9, 14784, 8316, 2, 3221, 23, 89, 8, 6501, 5586, 785, 2503, 412, 6, 223, 6501, 51, 3, 45, 159, 519, 1045, 2, 567, 1061, 7, 89, 14, 239, 60, 5, 4214, 78, 465, 1956, 341, 2533, 54, 88, 70, 215, 3822, 78, 203, 54, 88, 316, 478, 3822, 78, 79, 7205, 78, 67, 5670, 308, 30, 78, 39, 2, 12292, 78, 14, 648, 7, 357, 1217, 28, 3, 98, 1, 3, 451, 11, 1800, 29, 3, 1457, 65, 1, 806, 3120, 69, 512, 700, 42, 241, 1, 13011, 348, 240, 141, 167, 1, 531, 7, 662, 5, 3028, 5100, 57, 1, 3, 512, 7, 519, 42, 129, 785, 2299, 601, 42, 11260, 2122, 785, 2935, 3698, 350, 42, 35, 3698, 4, 14784, 8316, 2, 233, 42, 35, 3698, 4, 89, 470, 6501, 2935, 3, 287, 1, 671, 240, 13011, 4, 815, 342, 30, 7, 16, 64, 141, 7, 5, 57, 44, 2086, 6, 3, 7531, 12098, 2712, 46, 74, 309, 35, 18810, 4, 3, 287, 1, 121, 277, 13011, 330, 1293, 343, 257, 40, 509, 9, 342, 30, 7, 348, 36, 3, 174, 9, 121, 277, 13011, 279, 122, 44, 40, 95, 22, 35, 17140, 9, 6295, 6, 240, 9, 96, 7, 671, 240, 13011, 68, 40, 35, 191, 3287, 1, 854, 1880, 398, 1350, 17, 303, 1054, 3, 583, 228, 2092, 6, 240]",1890.0,12182973,Preirradiation endocrinopathies pediatric brain patients determined dynamic tests endocrine function,36,0.33962264150943394
Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of vinblastine and high-dose megestrol acetate.,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol.,2002-07-19,"Preclinical data indicate that progestational agents (progesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate and megestrol acetate) interact with p-glycoprotein (P-gp) and reverse P-gp-associated resistance to vinca alkaloids and other natural products. Based on these data, we performed a phase I study of high-dose oral megestrol acetate and vinblastine to evaluate the safety of this regimen. Enrolled in the study were 61 patients with advanced solid tumors, refractory to standard therapy. Cohorts of patients received megestrol acetate according to the following escalation scheme (loading dose/maintenance dose, twice daily for 7 days): 750 mg/250 mg, 750 mg/375 mg, 1000 mg/500 mg, 1500 mg/1000 mg, 3000 mg/2000 mg, 4500 mg/3000 mg, 6000 mg/4000 mg, and 7500 mg/5000 mg. They also received 1.5 mg/m(2) per day of vinblastine by continuous infusion for 5 days (days 2 to 6). Of the 61 patients, 59 were evaluable for toxicity. A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached. The regimen was well tolerated. Of the 59 patients, 10 (17%) experienced grade 4 leukopenia. All of these cases were at dose levels 3 to 8. There was an increase in the steady-state concentration (Css) of megestrol acetate with increasing dose up to the sixth dose level. Further increases in the dose produced no change in the megestrol acetate Css. Only 2.4% of megestrol acetate was free in the plasma as compared to 65.6% in RPMI culture medium. Megestrol acetate administration was associated with profound suppression of ACTH and cortisol levels. The combination of vinblastine and megestrol acetate was well tolerated. An MTD for this combination was not achieved as a result of the saturable absorption of megestrol acetate. Although potentially therapeutic serum concentrations of megestrol acetate were achieved, it is unlikely that MDR was reversed given the high protein-binding of the drug. Profound suppression of the pituitary-adrenal axis was also observed during the administration of megestrol acetate.",Clinical Trial,6395.0,5.0,Preclinical indicate progestational agents progesterone medroxyprogesterone acetate megestrol acetate interact p-glycoprotein P-gp reverse P-gp-associated resistance vinca alkaloids natural products Based performed phase high-dose oral megestrol acetate vinblastine evaluate safety regimen Enrolled 61 patients advanced solid refractory standard therapy Cohorts patients received megestrol acetate according following escalation scheme loading dose/maintenance dose twice daily 7 days 750 mg/250 mg 750 mg/375 mg 1000 mg/500 mg 1500 mg/1000 mg 3000 mg/2000 mg 4500 mg/3000 mg 6000 mg/4000 mg 7500 mg/5000 mg received 1.5 mg/m 2 day vinblastine continuous infusion 5 days days 2 6 61 patients 59 evaluable toxicity maximum tolerated dose MTD reached regimen tolerated 59 patients 10 17 experienced grade 4 leukopenia cases dose levels 3 8 increase steady-state concentration Css megestrol acetate increasing dose sixth dose level increases dose produced change megestrol acetate Css 2.4 megestrol acetate free plasma compared 65.6 RPMI culture medium Megestrol acetate administration associated profound suppression ACTH cortisol levels combination vinblastine megestrol acetate tolerated MTD combination achieved saturable absorption megestrol acetate potentially therapeutic serum concentrations megestrol acetate achieved unlikely MDR reversed given high protein-binding drug Profound suppression pituitary-adrenal axis observed administration megestrol acetate,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[693, 74, 1008, 17, 24500, 183, 2143, 18815, 3424, 2, 9740, 3424, 4491, 5, 19, 4455, 19, 5407, 2, 1772, 19, 5407, 41, 251, 6, 12729, 18187, 2, 127, 1504, 2766, 90, 23, 46, 74, 21, 173, 8, 124, 70, 45, 1, 64, 61, 518, 9740, 3424, 2, 5413, 6, 376, 3, 367, 1, 26, 477, 346, 4, 3, 45, 11, 713, 7, 5, 131, 537, 57, 430, 6, 260, 36, 736, 1, 7, 103, 9740, 3424, 768, 6, 3, 366, 1125, 4633, 4717, 61, 1146, 61, 936, 391, 9, 67, 162, 4506, 81, 2039, 81, 4506, 81, 4175, 81, 2345, 81, 1666, 81, 7204, 81, 2345, 81, 11264, 81, 1081, 81, 21002, 81, 11264, 81, 16187, 81, 10660, 81, 2, 33288, 81, 10410, 81, 491, 120, 103, 14, 33, 81, 188, 18, 379, 218, 1, 5413, 20, 1314, 904, 9, 33, 162, 162, 18, 6, 49, 1, 3, 713, 7, 728, 11, 859, 9, 155, 8, 689, 421, 61, 961, 10, 44, 1300, 3, 477, 10, 149, 421, 1, 3, 728, 7, 79, 269, 592, 88, 39, 3904, 62, 1, 46, 140, 11, 28, 61, 148, 27, 6, 66, 125, 10, 35, 344, 4, 3, 4152, 1309, 1227, 2687, 1, 9740, 3424, 5, 602, 61, 126, 6, 3, 7462, 61, 301, 195, 1106, 4, 3, 61, 1687, 77, 707, 4, 3, 9740, 3424, 2687, 158, 18, 39, 1, 9740, 3424, 10, 115, 4, 3, 554, 22, 72, 6, 556, 49, 4, 21064, 2099, 3759, 9740, 3424, 634, 10, 41, 5, 4399, 1332, 1, 14784, 2, 9572, 148, 3, 150, 1, 5413, 2, 9740, 3424, 10, 149, 421, 35, 961, 9, 26, 150, 10, 44, 513, 22, 8, 757, 1, 3, 25960, 6125, 1, 9740, 3424, 242, 751, 189, 524, 1003, 1, 9740, 3424, 11, 513, 192, 16, 3568, 17, 4186, 10, 3682, 447, 3, 64, 178, 791, 1, 3, 234, 4399, 1332, 1, 3, 12098, 2987, 2310, 10, 120, 164, 190, 3, 634, 1, 9740, 3424]",1938.0,12203099,Phase pharmacokinetic vinblastine high-dose megestrol acetate,0,0.0
A study on the radiation tolerance of the optic nerves and chiasm after stereotactic radiosurgery.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2003-04-01,"To evaluate the risk of clinically significant radiation optic neuropathy (RON) for patients having stereotactic radiosurgery of benign tumors adjacent to the optic apparatus. We reviewed the dose plans and clinical outcomes of 218 gamma knife procedures (215 patients) for tumors of the sellar and parasellar region (meningiomas, n = 122; pituitary adenomas, n = 89; craniopharyngiomas, n = 7 patients). Previous surgery or radiation therapy was performed in 156 (66%) and 24 (11%) patients, respectively. Median follow-up was 40 months (range 4-115). The median maximum radiation dose to the optic nerve was 10 Gy (range 0.4-16.0). Four patients (1.9%) developed RON at a median of 48 months after radiosurgery. All had prior surgery, and 3 of 4 had external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) in their management either before (n = 2) or adjuvantly (n = 1). The risk of developing a clinically significant RON was 1.1% for patients receiving 12 Gy or less.

"Menin associates with FANCD2, a protein involved in repair of DNA damage.",Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2003-07-01,"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN1) is an inherited tumor syndrome characterized by tumors in multiple endocrine organs including the parathyroids, pancreatic islets, and the pituitary. The gene mutated in MEN1 patients, Men1, encodes a protein of 610 amino acid residues, menin, and mutations in the Men1 gene lead to the MEN1 syndrome. Although the chromosomal instability in the peripheral lymphocytes from the MEN1 patients has been reported previously, it is not clear whether menin is involved in repair of DNA damage. Here we show that menin specifically interacts with FANCD2, a protein encoded by a gene involved in DNA repair and mutated in patients with an inherited cancer-prone syndrome, Fanconi anemia. The interaction between menin and FANCD2 is enhanced by gamma-irradiation. Moreover, loss of menin expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts leads to increased sensitivity to DNA damage. Furthermore, menin is localized to chromatin and nuclear matrix, and the association with nuclear matrix is enhanced by gamma-irradiation. Together, these results suggest that menin plays a critical role in repair of DNA damage in concert with FANCD2.",Journal Article,6048.0,121.0,Multiple endocrine neoplasia type MEN1 inherited syndrome characterized multiple endocrine organs including parathyroids pancreatic islets pituitary MEN1 patients Men1 encodes 610 amino acid residues menin Men1 lead MEN1 syndrome chromosomal instability peripheral lymphocytes MEN1 patients reported previously clear menin involved repair DNA damage menin specifically interacts FANCD2 encoded involved DNA repair patients inherited cancer-prone syndrome Fanconi anemia interaction menin FANCD2 enhanced gamma-irradiation loss menin expression mouse embryonic fibroblasts leads increased sensitivity DNA damage Furthermore menin localized chromatin nuclear matrix association nuclear matrix enhanced gamma-irradiation suggest menin plays critical role repair DNA damage concert FANCD2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[232, 1293, 2298, 267, 70, 7923, 16, 35, 2986, 30, 681, 765, 20, 57, 4, 232, 1293, 2285, 141, 3, 53644, 12746, 2, 3, 3, 145, 1185, 4, 7923, 7, 7923, 4322, 8, 178, 1, 11302, 3078, 971, 6418, 9191, 2, 138, 4, 3, 7923, 145, 1122, 6, 3, 7923, 681, 242, 3, 1860, 1753, 4, 3, 672, 1594, 29, 3, 7923, 7, 71, 85, 210, 373, 192, 16, 44, 885, 317, 9191, 16, 646, 4, 972, 1, 261, 1350, 467, 21, 514, 17, 9191, 1225, 5528, 5, 8949, 8, 178, 4587, 20, 8, 145, 646, 4, 261, 972, 2, 1185, 4, 7, 5, 35, 2986, 12, 7104, 681, 8057, 1545, 3, 915, 59, 9191, 2, 8949, 16, 651, 20, 1705, 1104, 1393, 407, 1, 9191, 55, 4, 830, 5390, 3921, 1940, 6, 101, 485, 6, 261, 1350, 798, 9191, 16, 909, 6, 2287, 2, 928, 2248, 2, 3, 248, 5, 928, 2248, 16, 651, 20, 1705, 1104, 1162, 46, 99, 309, 17, 9191, 1698, 8, 740, 200, 4, 972, 1, 261, 1350, 4, 10562, 5, 8949]",1118.0,12874027,Menin associates FANCD2 involved repair DNA damage,2,0.018867924528301886

Treatment records were abstracted and surveys completed by 921 adults aged 20-45 yr who were treated for brain cancer as children and were participants in the multicenter Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. Nearly 40% of childhood brain cancer survivors were below the 10th percentile for height. The strongest risk factors for adult short stature were young age at diagnosis and radiation treatment involving the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA). The multivariate odds ratio for adult short stature among those 4 yr of age or younger at diagnosis, relative to ages 10-20 yr, was 5.67 (95% confidence interval, 3.6-8.9). HPA radiation exposure increased the risk of adult short stature in a dose-response fashion (trend test, P < 0.0001). Adjuvant chemotherapy was not an independent risk factor for adult short stature. BMI distribution in survivors did not differ appreciably from that of population norms; however, in females, young age at diagnosis and HPA radiation dose (trend test, P < 0.001) were associated with risk of obesity.

The patient was subsequently given pegvisomant, an antagonist of growth hormone receptor, to control symptoms of growth hormone excess. The patient underwent transsphenoidal resection of the recurrent tumor, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. This led to significant relief in the patient's symptoms including radiological evidence of tumor shrinkage, but the tumor regrew when, owing to dose-limiting toxicity, chemotherapy was stopped.

Hypothalamic dysfunction after chemotherapy.,Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,J. Pediatr. Endocrinol. Metab.,2004-01-01,"Cranial irradiation with or without chemotherapy can cause hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction. Chemotherapy without cranial irradiation has not been thought to cause such deficiency. In order to determine whether chemotherapy without cranial irradiation can lead to hormonal deficiency, we reviewed the medical records of 362 childhood cancer patients who underwent full hypothalamic-pituitary evaluation because of altered growth and development after oncological therapy (1987-2002). Of these, 31 received chemotherapy but no cranial or total body irradiation and had no CNS tumor: 18 had hematological malignancy and 13 had a solid tumor of the torso or extremity. Duration of follow-up was 13.0 +/- 4.1 years (mean +/- SD). Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) was identified in 15 (48%), central hypothyroidism (TSH-D) in 16 (52%), and pubertal abnormalities in 10 (32%). Pubertal abnormalities included precocious puberty in two (6%), gonadal failure in five of 27 who were old enough to assess puberty (19%), and gonadotropin deficiency in three of 27 (11%). GHD and TSH-D were co-existent in eight patients (26%). Overall, 81% (n = 25) had GHD, TSH-D, precocious puberty, and/or gonadotropin deficiency.

The role of radiation therapy after surgical resection of nonfunctional pituitary macroadenomas.,Neurosurgery,Neurosurgery,2004-07-01,"Radiotherapy after aggressive surgical resection of nonfunctional macroadenoma (NFA) of the pituitary remains controversial. Historically, immediate postoperative radiotherapy has been recommended to decrease risk of recurrence. With the availability of high-resolution imaging, most neurosurgeons now withhold radiation until recurrence. There is relatively little evidence to support this practice, however. This study reviews postoperative results in a large number of patients with NFA, the majority of whom did not undergo prophylactic radiation. Of the 258 patients who underwent surgery from 1979 to 1999 for NFA, medical records were available for 176. Forty-four patients were treated with immediate postoperative radiotherapy after tumor resection, and the remaining 132 patients were followed up with serial imaging studies and treated with radiotherapy only when a recurrence was documented by follow-up imaging. Patients in the group that received immediate postoperative radiotherapy at time of initial diagnosis and surgery did not differ significantly with respect to age or sex from those in the group that was observed. Five- and 10-year recurrence rates were 2.3 and 2.3%, respectively, for patients who received immediate postoperative radiotherapy, as compared with 15.2 and 50.5%, respectively, for patients who were followed up and did not receive radiotherapy unless there was evidence of recurrence or progression. No patient had symptomatic recurrence in the group that was observed if consistent follow-up was performed. Of the 26 patients who received radiotherapy at time of tumor recurrence or progression, 18 had adequate follow-up, and in all cases, the tumors either remained stable or regressed. Withholding radiotherapy after a high-percentage resection of NFA leads to a higher recurrence rate, but it avoids exposing all patients to the risks of radiation. Deferring radiotherapy for patients with complete or near-complete resection seems to be a safe and prudent approach, as our data suggest that recurrences may be detected early with high-resolution imaging and treated effectively with radiation at time of recurrence. Therefore, immediate postoperative radiotherapy may be eliminated for patients with complete or near complete resection of NFA and who agree to undergo close follow-up for a long period.",Journal Article,5682.0,101.0,Radiotherapy aggressive surgical resection nonfunctional macroadenoma NFA pituitary remains controversial Historically immediate postoperative radiotherapy recommended decrease risk recurrence availability high-resolution imaging neurosurgeons withhold radiation recurrence relatively little evidence support practice reviews postoperative large number patients NFA majority undergo prophylactic radiation 258 patients underwent surgery 1979 1999 NFA medical records available 176 Forty-four patients treated immediate postoperative radiotherapy resection remaining 132 patients followed serial imaging studies treated radiotherapy recurrence documented follow-up imaging Patients group received immediate postoperative radiotherapy time initial diagnosis surgery differ significantly respect age sex group observed Five- 10-year recurrence rates 2.3 2.3 respectively patients received immediate postoperative radiotherapy compared 15.2 50.5 respectively patients followed receive radiotherapy evidence recurrence progression patient symptomatic recurrence group observed consistent follow-up performed 26 patients received radiotherapy time recurrence progression 18 adequate follow-up cases remained stable regressed Withholding radiotherapy high-percentage resection NFA leads higher recurrence rate avoids exposing patients risks radiation Deferring radiotherapy patients complete near-complete resection safe prudent approach suggest recurrences detected early high-resolution imaging treated effectively radiation time recurrence immediate postoperative radiotherapy eliminated patients complete near complete resection NFA agree undergo close follow-up long period,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[310, 50, 571, 221, 170, 1, 12260, 27905, 24724, 1, 3, 469, 2010, 3578, 2181, 573, 310, 71, 85, 793, 6, 775, 43, 1, 146, 5, 3, 2550, 1, 64, 2125, 270, 96, 12726, 1134, 30618, 121, 1100, 146, 125, 16, 1352, 1215, 241, 6, 538, 26, 758, 137, 26, 45, 2004, 573, 99, 4, 8, 375, 207, 1, 7, 5, 24724, 3, 686, 1, 953, 205, 44, 1251, 1862, 121, 1, 3, 8289, 7, 54, 208, 152, 29, 9444, 6, 2043, 9, 24724, 484, 1064, 11, 390, 9, 5800, 1213, 294, 7, 11, 73, 5, 2181, 573, 310, 50, 30, 170, 2, 3, 1844, 4255, 7, 11, 370, 126, 5, 2108, 270, 94, 2, 73, 5, 310, 158, 198, 8, 146, 10, 1405, 20, 166, 126, 270, 7, 4, 3, 87, 17, 103, 2181, 573, 310, 28, 98, 1, 388, 147, 2, 152, 205, 44, 1505, 97, 5, 2184, 6, 89, 15, 1035, 29, 135, 4, 3, 87, 17, 10, 164, 365, 2, 79, 111, 146, 151, 11, 18, 27, 2, 18, 27, 106, 9, 7, 54, 103, 2181, 573, 310, 22, 72, 5, 167, 18, 2, 212, 33, 106, 9, 7, 54, 11, 370, 126, 2, 205, 44, 560, 310, 6179, 125, 10, 241, 1, 146, 15, 91, 77, 69, 42, 1704, 146, 4, 3, 87, 17, 10, 164, 492, 925, 166, 126, 10, 173, 1, 3, 432, 7, 54, 103, 310, 28, 98, 1, 30, 146, 15, 91, 203, 42, 1658, 166, 126, 2, 4, 62, 140, 3, 57, 361, 958, 585, 15, 12579, 16673, 310, 50, 8, 64, 1150, 170, 1, 24724, 1940, 6, 8, 142, 146, 116, 84, 192, 14139, 14548, 62, 7, 6, 3, 1098, 1, 121, 22214, 310, 9, 7, 5, 236, 15, 1829, 236, 170, 2744, 6, 40, 8, 1165, 2, 10263, 353, 22, 114, 74, 309, 17, 1593, 68, 40, 530, 191, 5, 64, 2125, 270, 2, 73, 1856, 5, 121, 28, 98, 1, 146, 673, 2181, 573, 310, 68, 40, 6173, 9, 7, 5, 236, 15, 1829, 236, 170, 1, 24724, 2, 54, 10473, 6, 1251, 2336, 166, 126, 9, 8, 319, 727]",2303.0,15214978,role radiation therapy surgical resection nonfunctional pituitary macroadenomas,0,0.0
Factors that affect final height and change in height standard deviation scores in survivors of childhood cancer treated with growth hormone: a report from the childhood cancer survivor study.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2004-09-01,"GH deficiency is a common late complication in survivors of pediatric malignancies, particularly those who are treated with radiation (RT) to the hypothalamic-pituitary region. Nonetheless, few reports have assessed final height outcomes in survivors treated with GH. In the present study, we investigated which patient and treatment variables correlate with final height and change in height sd score (SDS) in a large cohort of cancer survivors treated with GH. We previously identified 361 participants in the multicenter Childhood Cancer Survivor Study who were treated with GH. Final height data were available in 183 survivors (120 males). Diagnoses included: central nervous system tumors (n = 90), acute leukemia (n = 64), soft tissue sarcomas (n = 23), and miscellaneous (n = 6). The median age at diagnosis of the primary cancer was 4.6 yr, and the median age at start of GH treatment was 11.3 yr. Mean height SDS at start of GH therapy was -2.03 +/- 0.8, and the mean final height SDS was -1.48 +/- 0.10 (P < 0.001). Final height SDS was positively associated with target height and dose of GH but negatively associated with the presence of concomitant endocrinopathies and dose of spinal RT. Change in height SDS (start of GH-final height) was positively associated with male gender, younger bone age at start of GH, and dose of GH; presence of concomitant endocrinopathies and dose of spinal RT were negatively associated with change in height SDS. Risk factors associated with a final height of -2.0 sd or less included lower doses of GH and exposure to higher doses of spinal RT. Thus, to maximize final height, our findings emphasize the importance of beginning GH therapy at the earliest bone age that is clinically feasible; treating with conventional higher doses of GH; and, when possible, minimizing the dose of spinal RT.",Journal Article,5620.0,58.0,GH deficiency common late complication survivors pediatric malignancies particularly treated radiation RT hypothalamic-pituitary region Nonetheless reports assessed final height outcomes survivors treated GH present investigated patient treatment variables correlate final height change height sd score SDS large cohort survivors treated GH previously identified 361 participants multicenter Childhood Survivor treated GH Final height available 183 survivors 120 males Diagnoses included central nervous n 90 acute leukemia n 64 soft tissue sarcomas n 23 miscellaneous n 6 median age diagnosis primary 4.6 yr median age start GH treatment 11.3 yr Mean height SDS start GH therapy -2.03 +/- 0.8 mean final height SDS -1.48 +/- 0.10 P 0.001 Final height SDS positively associated target height dose GH negatively associated presence concomitant endocrinopathies dose spinal RT Change height SDS start GH-final height positively associated male gender younger bone age start GH dose GH presence concomitant endocrinopathies dose spinal RT negatively associated change height SDS Risk factors associated final height -2.0 sd included lower doses GH exposure higher doses spinal RT maximize final height findings emphasize importance beginning GH therapy earliest bone age clinically feasible treating conventional higher doses GH possible minimizing dose spinal RT,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4579, 2299, 16, 8, 186, 807, 1447, 4, 332, 1, 815, 441, 823, 135, 54, 32, 73, 5, 121, 240, 6, 3, 7531, 12098, 1053, 4648, 1021, 1198, 47, 275, 1457, 4594, 123, 4, 332, 73, 5, 4579, 4, 3, 364, 45, 21, 565, 92, 69, 2, 24, 682, 1513, 5, 1457, 4594, 2, 707, 4, 4594, 1270, 368, 8668, 4, 8, 375, 180, 1, 12, 332, 73, 5, 4579, 21, 373, 108, 9234, 776, 4, 3, 1570, 864, 12, 2628, 45, 54, 11, 73, 5, 4579, 1457, 4594, 74, 11, 390, 4, 6348, 332, 2031, 2296, 2403, 159, 854, 1880, 398, 57, 78, 424, 286, 78, 660, 1214, 246, 1479, 78, 382, 2, 15106, 78, 49, 3, 52, 89, 28, 147, 1, 3, 86, 12, 10, 39, 49, 2830, 2, 3, 52, 89, 28, 2435, 1, 4579, 24, 10, 175, 27, 2830, 313, 4594, 8668, 28, 2435, 1, 4579, 36, 10, 18, 680, 13, 66, 2, 3, 313, 1457, 4594, 8668, 10, 14, 576, 13, 79, 19, 13, 144, 1457, 4594, 8668, 10, 2375, 41, 5, 283, 4594, 2, 61, 1, 4579, 84, 2723, 41, 5, 3, 463, 1, 1781, 12081, 2, 61, 1, 1499, 240, 707, 4, 4594, 8668, 2435, 1, 4579, 1457, 4594, 10, 2375, 41, 5, 1045, 1632, 773, 89, 28, 2435, 1, 4579, 2, 61, 1, 4579, 463, 1, 1781, 12081, 2, 61, 1, 1499, 240, 11, 2723, 41, 5, 707, 4, 4594, 8668, 43, 130, 41, 5, 8, 1457, 4594, 1, 18, 13, 1270, 15, 299, 159, 280, 415, 1, 4579, 2, 645, 6, 142, 415, 1, 1499, 240, 631, 6, 4116, 1457, 4594, 114, 272, 5560, 3, 1187, 1, 2948, 4579, 36, 28, 3, 6995, 89, 17, 16, 505, 1313, 1367, 5, 809, 142, 415, 1, 4579, 2, 198, 899, 4501, 3, 61, 1, 1499, 240]",1765.0,15356041,Factors affect final height change height standard deviation scores survivors childhood treated growth hormone report childhood survivor,0,0.0
Genetic effects of radiotherapy for childhood cancer: gonadal dose reconstruction.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2004-10-01,"To estimate the doses of radiation to organs of interest during treatment of childhood cancer for use in an epidemiologic study of possible heritable diseases, including birth defects, chromosomal abnormalities, cancer, stillbirth, and neonatal and premature death. The study population was composed of more than 25,000 patients with cancer in Denmark and the United States who were survivors of childhood cancer and subsequently had nearly 6,500 children of their own. Radiation therapy records were sought for the survivors who parented offspring who had adverse pregnancy outcomes (>300 offspring), and for a sample of all survivors in a case-cohort design. The records were imaged and centrally abstracted. Water phantom measurements were made to estimate doses for a wide range of treatments. Mathematical phantoms were used to apply measured results to estimate doses to ovaries, uterus, testes, and pituitary for patients ranging in age from newborn to 25 years. Gonadal shielding, ovarian pinning (oophoropexy), and field blocking were taken into account. Testicular radiation doses ranged from <1 to 700 cGy (median, 7 cGy) and ovarian doses from <1 to >2,500 cGy (median, 13 cGy). Ten percent of the records were incomplete, but sufficient data were available for broad characterizations of gonadal dose. More than 49% of the gonadal doses were >10 cGy and 16% were >100 cGy. Sufficient radiation therapy data exist as far back as 1943 to enable computation of gonadal doses administered for curative therapy for childhood cancer.

The median patient age was 45 years (range, 10-81 yr). Nineteen patients also had radiation therapy before or in conjunction with radiosurgery (median dose, 50.4 Gy). The median tumor volume was 14.4 cm3 (range, 0.6-65.1 cm3). The median tumor margin dose was 15 Gy (range, 10-20 Gy); the median maximum radiation dose was 30 Gy (range, 20-40 Gy).

The tumor volumes from 8 patients (3 retinoblastomas, 2 medulloblastomas, and 3 pelvic sarcomas) were studied retrospectively to compare DVHs from proton therapy with 3D-CRT, electron therapy, and IMRT. In retinoblastoma, several planning techniques were analyzed: A single electron appositional beam was compared with a single 3D-CRT lateral beam, a 3D-CRT anterior beam paired with a lateral beam, IMRT, and protons. In medulloblastoma, three posterior fossa irradiation techniques were analyzed: 3D-CRT, IMRT, and protons. Craniospinal irradiation (which consisted of composite plans of both the posterior fossa and craniospinal components) was also evaluated, primarily comparing spinal irradiation using 3D-CRT electrons, 3D-CRT photons, and protons. Lastly, in pelvic sarcoma, 3D-CRT, IMRT, and proton plans were assessed. In retinoblastoma, protons resulted in the best target coverage combined with the most orbital bone sparing (10% was the mean orbital bone volume irradiated at > or =5 Gy for protons vs. 25% for 3D-CRT electrons, 69% for IMRT, 41% for a single 3D lateral beam, 51% for a 3D anterolateral beam with a lens block, and 65% for a 3D anterolateral beam without a lens block). A single appositional electron field was the next best technique followed by other planning approaches. In medulloblastoma, for posterior fossa and craniospinal irradiation, protons resulted in the least dose to the cochlea (for only posterior fossa irradiation at > or =20 Gy, 34% was the mean cochlear volume irradiated for protons, 87% for IMRT, 89% for 3D-CRT) and hypothalamus-pituitary axis (for only posterior fossa irradiation at > or =10 Gy, 21% was the mean hypothalamus-pituitary volume irradiated for protons, 81% for IMRT, 91% for 3D-CRT); additional dose reductions to the optic chiasm, eyes, vertebrae, mandible, thyroid, lung, kidneys, heart, and liver were seen. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy appeared to be the second best technique for posterior fossa irradiation. For spinal irradiation 3D-CRT electrons were better than 3D-CRT photons in sparing dose to the thyroid, heart, lung, kidney, and liver. With pelvic sarcoma, protons were superior in eliminating any dose to the ovaries (0% of mean ovarian volume was irradiated at > or =2 Gy with protons) and to some extent, the pelvic bones and vertebrae. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy did show more bladder dose reduction than the other techniques in pelvic sarcoma irradiation. In the diseases studied, using various techniques of 3D-CRT, electrons, IMRT, and protons, protons are most optimal in treating retinoblastomas, medulloblastomas (posterior fossa and craniospinal), and pelvic sarcomas. Protons delivered superior target dose coverage and sparing of normal structures. As dose-volume parameters are expected to correlate with acute and late toxicity, proton therapy should receive serious consideration as the preferred technique for the treatment of pediatric tumors.",Comparative Study,5225.0,173.0,calculate treatment plans compare dose distributions dose-volume histograms DVHs photon three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy 3D-CRT electron therapy

Its precise incidence is unknown, and data concerning its risk factors are limited. Our objective was to determine the incidence of and patient/treatment factors associated with AOF in a large cohort of pediatric cancer survivors. We conducted a retrospective cohort, multicenter study. Female participants from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study who were greater than 18 yr of age were considered for inclusion. We excluded survivors who received cranial irradiation at doses of more than 3000 cGy, those with hypothalamic/pituitary tumors, and survivors who underwent bilateral oophorectomy. Survivors who reported never menstruating or who had ceased having menses within 5 yr after their cancer diagnosis were considered to have AOF. We assessed incidence and risk factors for AOF. Of a total of 3390 eligible survivors, 215 cases (6.3%) developed AOF. Survivors with AOF were older at diagnosis and more likely to have been diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma or to have received abdominal or pelvic radiotherapy than survivors without AOF. Among survivors with AOF, 116 (54%) had received at least 1000-cGy ovarian irradiation. In a multivariable logistic regression model, increasing doses of ovarian irradiation, exposure to procarbazine, and exposure to cyclophosphamide at ages 13-20 yr were independent risk factors for AOF. AOF develops in a small subset of survivors, especially those treated with at least 1000-cGy ovarian radiation. These results will facilitate patient counseling and selection of candidates for newer fertility preservation techniques.",Journal Article,5082.0,272.0,Defined loss ovarian function 5 yr diagnosis acute ovarian failure AOF known develop subset survivors pediatric adolescent precise incidence unknown concerning risk factors limited objective determine incidence patient/treatment factors associated AOF large cohort pediatric survivors conducted retrospective cohort multicenter Female participants Childhood Survivor greater 18 yr age considered inclusion excluded survivors received cranial irradiation doses 3000 cGy hypothalamic/pituitary survivors underwent bilateral oophorectomy Survivors reported menstruating ceased menses 5 yr diagnosis considered AOF assessed incidence risk factors AOF total 3390 eligible survivors 215 cases 6.3 developed AOF Survivors AOF older diagnosis likely diagnosed Hodgkin 's lymphoma received abdominal pelvic radiotherapy survivors AOF survivors AOF 116 54 received 1000-cGy ovarian irradiation multivariable logistic regression model increasing doses ovarian irradiation exposure procarbazine exposure cyclophosphamide ages 13-20 yr independent risk factors AOF AOF develops small subset survivors especially treated 1000-cGy ovarian radiation facilitate patient counseling selection candidates newer fertility preservation techniques,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[395, 22, 3, 407, 1, 343, 262, 33, 2830, 1, 147, 286, 496, 20492, 16, 440, 6, 690, 4, 8, 697, 1, 332, 1, 815, 2, 3678, 163, 211, 3260, 287, 16, 860, 2, 74, 4243, 211, 43, 130, 32, 383, 114, 461, 10, 6, 223, 3, 287, 1, 2, 69, 24, 130, 41, 5, 20492, 4, 8, 375, 180, 1, 815, 12, 332, 21, 426, 8, 459, 180, 1570, 45, 1061, 776, 29, 3, 864, 12, 2628, 45, 54, 11, 378, 76, 203, 2830, 1, 89, 11, 515, 9, 1680, 21, 1800, 332, 54, 103, 2565, 1104, 28, 415, 1, 80, 76, 11264, 3071, 135, 5, 7531, 12098, 57, 2, 332, 54, 208, 1607, 3470, 332, 54, 210, 1737, 38118, 15, 54, 42, 17710, 1041, 15963, 262, 33, 2830, 50, 136, 12, 147, 11, 515, 6, 47, 20492, 21, 275, 287, 2, 43, 130, 9, 20492, 1, 8, 181, 1, 44252, 625, 332, 6511, 140, 49, 27, 276, 20492, 332, 5, 20492, 11, 434, 28, 147, 2, 80, 322, 6, 47, 85, 265, 5, 292, 15, 6, 47, 103, 1467, 15, 1110, 310, 76, 332, 187, 20492, 107, 332, 5, 20492, 3790, 667, 42, 103, 28, 506, 2345, 3071, 1104, 4, 8, 658, 812, 320, 202, 602, 415, 1, 1104, 645, 6, 8860, 2, 645, 6, 1112, 28, 2165, 233, 179, 2830, 11, 306, 43, 130, 9, 20492, 20492, 4734, 4, 8, 302, 697, 1, 332, 1093, 135, 73, 5, 28, 506, 2345, 3071, 121, 46, 99, 303, 1876, 69, 2011, 2, 881, 1, 1931, 9, 2246, 2954, 2224, 1092]",1655.0,16492690,Acute ovarian failure childhood survivor,1,0.009433962264150943
Long-term response of pituitary carcinoma to temozolomide. Report of two cases.,Journal of neurosurgery,J. Neurosurg.,2006-10-01,"Pituitary carcinoma is a rare tumor characterized by poor responsiveness to therapy, leading to early death. Reported responses to standard chemotherapy have only been anecdotal, with no single agent or combination demonstrating consistent efficacy in the treatment of patients with this disease. The authors report rare examples of a persistent response to cytotoxic chemotherapy in two patients with pituitary carcinoma. One patient was a 38-year-old man with visual field loss caused by a luteinizing hormone-secreting pituitary carcinoma that had recurred despite multiple surgeries and radiation therapy. Intradural metastases to the spine that had failed to respond to radiation therapy were pathologically confirmed. The second patient was a 26-year-old man with hyperprolactinemia from a prolactin-secreting pituitary tumor. Spine magnetic resonance images obtained to search for causes of neck pain showed a vertebral tumor, which was later confirmed through pathological analysis to be a metastatic pituitary carcinoma. His disease progressed despite radiation therapy, high-dose bromocriptine, and chemotherapy. Both patients were treated monthly with temozolomide, which was administered orally on the first 5 days of a 28-day cycle. The patient in the first case underwent all 12 treatment cycles without serious side effects, and his visual field deficits improved. The patient in the second case had undergone only 10 cycles when the drug was stopped because of his severe fatigue. Nonetheless, his pain disappeared and his serum prolactin concentration decreased.

Comparative analysis of germ cell transcription factors in CNS germinoma reveals diagnostic utility of NANOG.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2006-12-01,"The homeodomain transcription factor, NANOG, along with OCT3/4 (POU5F1) and SOX2, is part of the core set of transcription factors that maintain embryonic stem cell self-renewal and pluripotency. Expression of NANOG has been detected in fetal germ cells and in gonadal germ cell tumors. To assess the diagnostic utility of NANOG in central nervous system (CNS) germ cell tumors, we analyzed its expression by immunohistochemistry in a series of 12 CNS germinomas and compared its expression with other stem cell markers. Strong nuclear expression of NANOG was demonstrated in >90% of the tumor cells in all cases. In contrast, expression of OCT3/4 and placental alkaline phosphatase was inconsistent and SOX2 was expressed in only rare cells. NANOG was not detected in tumor types frequently considered in the differential diagnosis of CNS germinoma: pineoblastoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumors, medulloblastoma, lymphoma, pituitary adenoma, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and gliomas. These findings demonstrate that NANOG is a sensitive and specific marker of CNS germinoma. Compared with other currently used markers, NANOG may have superior diagnostic characteristics and can facilitate identification of germinomas in minute surgical biopsies commonly obtained from these tumors. These findings also suggest a potential biologic role for NANOG in maintenance of CNS germinoma.",Comparative Study,4799.0,35.0,homeodomain transcription factor NANOG OCT3/4 POU5F1 SOX2 core set transcription factors maintain embryonic stem self-renewal pluripotency Expression NANOG detected fetal germ gonadal germ assess diagnostic utility NANOG central nervous CNS germ expression immunohistochemistry series 12 CNS germinomas compared expression stem markers Strong nuclear expression NANOG demonstrated 90 cases contrast expression OCT3/4 placental alkaline phosphatase inconsistent SOX2 expressed rare NANOG detected types frequently considered differential diagnosis CNS germinoma pineoblastoma primitive neuroectodermal medulloblastoma lymphoma pituitary adenoma atypical teratoid/rhabdoid Langerhans histiocytosis gliomas findings demonstrate NANOG sensitive specific marker CNS germinoma Compared currently markers NANOG superior diagnostic characteristics facilitate identification germinomas minute surgical biopsies commonly obtained findings suggest potential biologic role NANOG maintenance CNS germinoma,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 18140, 866, 161, 11851, 1510, 5, 14184, 39, 34181, 2, 4664, 16, 760, 1, 3, 1793, 916, 1, 866, 130, 17, 3040, 5390, 452, 31, 1074, 4495, 2, 13153, 55, 1, 11851, 71, 85, 530, 4, 6698, 2280, 37, 2, 4, 7999, 2280, 31, 57, 6, 423, 3, 752, 1207, 1, 11851, 4, 854, 1880, 398, 1025, 2280, 31, 57, 21, 311, 211, 55, 20, 888, 4, 8, 988, 1, 133, 1025, 14493, 2, 72, 211, 55, 5, 127, 452, 31, 525, 1082, 928, 55, 1, 11851, 10, 264, 4, 424, 1, 3, 30, 37, 4, 62, 140, 4, 748, 55, 1, 14184, 39, 2, 9690, 5355, 2577, 10, 4923, 2, 4664, 10, 570, 4, 158, 622, 37, 11851, 10, 44, 530, 4, 30, 630, 746, 515, 4, 3, 1777, 147, 1, 1025, 12292, 14221, 5594, 7160, 57, 2714, 2434, 1973, 12478, 15458, 30, 15702, 31, 13976, 2, 1287, 46, 272, 608, 17, 11851, 16, 8, 745, 2, 112, 952, 1, 1025, 12292, 72, 5, 127, 694, 95, 525, 11851, 68, 47, 1123, 752, 374, 2, 122, 1876, 911, 1, 14493, 4, 3949, 221, 1154, 841, 683, 29, 46, 57, 46, 272, 120, 309, 8, 174, 1283, 200, 9, 11851, 4, 1146, 1, 1025, 12292]",1371.0,17122519,Comparative germ transcription factors CNS germinoma reveals diagnostic utility NANOG,0,0.0

Cushing's Syndrome attributable to ectopic secretion of corticotropin in a patient with two neuroendocrine tumors.,Endocrine practice : official journal of the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists,Endocr Pract,,"To report a case of ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndrome (EAS) in a patient with two distinct neuroendocrine tumors and to highlight the difficulties of establishing the differential diagnosis of EAS. We describe the clinical presentation of the current case, discuss its management, and report the results of molecular studies undertaken to determine whether the two tumors had a common origin. A 52-year-old woman presented with obvious features of Cushing's syndrome. Findings on hormonal evaluation were consistent with EAS. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging revealed normal findings. Computed tomographic imaging disclosed two masses, one in the lung and one in the pancreas. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy showed uptake only in the pancreatic mass, which was surgically removed. It was a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor, with negative immunostaining for ACTH. Hypercortisolemia did not resolve after removal of the pancreatic tumor. The lung mass was subsequently excised, and pathology examination showed a carcinoid tumor with immunostaining for ACTH. Thereafter, plasma ACTH became immeasurable. The two tumors had similar patterns of X-chromosome inactivation; thus, whether they arose independently could be neither confirmed nor excluded. This case demonstrates that, in the presence of more than one neuroendocrine tumor, somatostatin receptor scintigraphy may misguide the decision regarding the appropriate surgical course in patients with EAS, and it highlights the need for accurate studies to determine the source of ACTH in patients with EAS.",Case Reports,,5.0,report case ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone ACTH syndrome EAS patient distinct neuroendocrine highlight difficulties establishing differential diagnosis EAS clinical presentation current case discuss management report molecular studies undertaken determine common origin 52-year-old woman presented obvious features Cushing 's syndrome Findings hormonal evaluation consistent EAS Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging revealed normal findings Computed tomographic imaging disclosed masses lung pancreas Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy showed uptake pancreatic mass surgically removed well-differentiated neuroendocrine negative immunostaining ACTH Hypercortisolemia resolve removal pancreatic lung mass subsequently excised pathology examination showed carcinoid immunostaining ACTH plasma ACTH immeasurable similar patterns X-chromosome inactivation arose independently confirmed excluded case demonstrates presence neuroendocrine somatostatin receptor scintigraphy misguide decision appropriate surgical course patients EAS highlights need accurate studies determine source ACTH patients EAS,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 414, 8, 473, 1, 3647, 22401, 785, 14784, 681, 18491, 4, 8, 69, 5, 100, 834, 1542, 57, 2, 6, 1817, 3, 4679, 1, 4431, 3, 1777, 147, 1, 18491, 21, 897, 3, 38, 1031, 1, 3, 291, 473, 1139, 211, 284, 2, 414, 3, 99, 1, 219, 94, 2789, 6, 223, 317, 3, 100, 57, 42, 8, 186, 1938, 8, 653, 111, 1095, 2854, 917, 5, 6228, 404, 1, 16258, 292, 681, 272, 23, 1761, 451, 11, 925, 5, 18491, 1484, 1535, 270, 553, 295, 272, 1220, 6158, 270, 15891, 100, 2692, 104, 4, 3, 2, 104, 4, 3, 6203, 153, 7577, 224, 1135, 158, 4, 3, 782, 92, 10, 2350, 2264, 192, 10, 8, 149, 1442, 1542, 30, 5, 199, 5027, 9, 14784, 44592, 205, 44, 8244, 50, 2829, 1, 3, 30, 3, 782, 10, 1611, 5076, 2, 1117, 1385, 224, 8, 30, 5, 5027, 9, 14784, 3972, 554, 14784, 3451, 56002, 3, 100, 57, 42, 288, 764, 1, 1006, 1170, 2297, 631, 317, 491, 7268, 1042, 359, 40, 2174, 557, 2110, 1800, 26, 473, 1902, 17, 4, 3, 463, 1, 80, 76, 104, 1542, 30, 6203, 153, 7577, 68, 56003, 3, 948, 666, 3, 870, 221, 906, 4, 7, 5, 18491, 2, 192, 2527, 3, 594, 9, 1481, 94, 6, 223, 3, 2353, 1, 14784, 4, 7, 5, 18491]",1503.0,17229662,Cushing 's Syndrome attributable ectopic secretion corticotropin patient neuroendocrine,0,0.0
Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists in premenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.,Clinical breast cancer,Clin. Breast Cancer,2007-02-01,"Ovarian function suppression for the treatment of premenopausal breast cancer was first used in the late 19th century. Traditionally, ovarian function suppression had been accomplished irreversibly via irradiation or surgery, but analogues of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) have emerged as reliable and reversible agents for this purpose, especially the LH-RH agonists. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonists are in earlier stages of development in breast cancer and are not currently in clinical use. Luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone agonists act by pituitary desensitization and receptor downregulation, thereby suppressing gonadotrophin release. Limited information is available comparing the efficacies of the depot preparations of various agonists, but pharmacodynamic studies have shown comparable suppressive capabilities on estradiol and luteinizing hormone. At present, only monthly goserelin is Food and Drug Administration-approved for the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive, premenopausal metastatic breast cancer in the United States. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists have proven to be as effective as surgical oophorectomy in premenopausal advanced breast cancer. They offer similar outcomes compared with tamoxifen, but the endocrine combination appears to be more effective than LH-RH agonists alone. In the adjuvant setting, LH-RH agonists versus no therapy reduce the annual odds of recurrence and death in women aged>50 years with estrogen receptor-positive tumors. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists alone or in combination with tamoxifen have shown disease-free survival rates similar to chemotherapy with CMF (cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/5-fluorouracil). Outcomes of chemotherapy with or without LH-RH agonists are comparable, though a few trials favor the combination in young premenopausal women (aged<40 years). Adjuvant LH-RH agonists with or without tamoxifen might be as efficacious as tamoxifen alone, and the additional benefit from chemotherapy is unclear.

Transgenic E2F1 expression in the mouse brain induces a human-like bimodal pattern of tumors.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2007-05-01,"The Rb/E2F pathway is deregulated in most human brain tumors, and the finding that loss of E2F1 reduced pituitary tumorigenesis in Rb(+/-) mice suggests that loss of pRb induces brain tumors by activating E2F1. We therefore investigated the role of E2F1 in the development and maintenance of brain cancer using a transgenic mouse model engineered to express E2F1 specifically within glial cells (GFAP-tgE2F1). GFAP-tgE2F1 mice developed a highly penetrant phenotype characterized by neurologic defects, and examination of the brains revealed the presence of brain tumors in 20% of these animals. Importantly, the distribution of tumors according to mouse age suggests the existence of a bimodal pattern of tumor development, forcing a comparison with the human disease. Mice, at an early age, with deregulated E2F1 show the formation of embryonal brain tumors such as medulloblastoma, choroid plexus carcinoma, and primary neuroectodermal tumor. Conversely, at an older age, mice escaping embryonal tumor formation present with malignant gliomas, which are typically identified in the human adult population. Thus, this study offers the first evidence for a global role of E2F1 in the formation and maintenance of multilineage brain tumors, irrefutably establishing E2F1 as an oncogene in the brain.",Journal Article,4648.0,20.0,Rb/E2F pathway deregulated human brain finding loss E2F1 reduced pituitary tumorigenesis Rb +/- mice suggests loss pRb induces brain activating E2F1 investigated role E2F1 development maintenance brain transgenic mouse model engineered express E2F1 specifically glial GFAP-tgE2F1 GFAP-tgE2F1 mice developed highly penetrant phenotype characterized neurologic defects examination brains revealed presence brain 20 animals Importantly distribution according mouse age suggests existence bimodal pattern development forcing comparison human disease Mice early age deregulated E2F1 formation embryonal brain medulloblastoma choroid plexus carcinoma primary neuroectodermal Conversely older age mice escaping embryonal formation present malignant gliomas typically identified human adult population offers evidence global role E2F1 formation maintenance multilineage brain irrefutably establishing E2F1 oncogene brain,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 2955, 5391, 308, 16, 5415, 4, 96, 171, 342, 57, 2, 3, 1567, 17, 407, 1, 6112, 405, 1565, 4, 2955, 399, 844, 17, 407, 1, 8734, 1516, 342, 57, 20, 1616, 6112, 21, 673, 565, 3, 200, 1, 6112, 4, 3, 193, 2, 1146, 1, 342, 12, 75, 8, 2862, 830, 202, 2794, 6, 1669, 6112, 1225, 262, 6944, 37, 13154, 44710, 13154, 44710, 399, 276, 8, 561, 10301, 1005, 765, 20, 2543, 2945, 2, 1385, 1, 3, 13859, 553, 3, 463, 1, 342, 57, 4, 179, 1, 46, 2258, 1859, 3, 1395, 1, 57, 768, 6, 830, 89, 844, 3, 5335, 1, 8, 18225, 1177, 1, 30, 193, 34269, 8, 1155, 5, 3, 171, 34, 399, 28, 35, 191, 89, 5, 5415, 6112, 514, 3, 1264, 1, 5239, 342, 57, 225, 22, 2714, 12169, 9576, 134, 2, 86, 7160, 30, 3154, 28, 35, 434, 89, 399, 26578, 5239, 30, 1264, 364, 5, 393, 1287, 92, 32, 1969, 108, 4, 3, 171, 780, 266, 631, 26, 45, 2339, 3, 157, 241, 9, 8, 1648, 200, 1, 6112, 4, 3, 1264, 2, 1146, 1, 12471, 342, 57, 56243, 4431, 6112, 22, 35, 1836, 4, 3, 342]",1265.0,17483310,Transgenic E2F1 expression mouse brain induces human-like bimodal pattern,0,0.0
Expression of p16Ink4a compensates for p18Ink4c loss in cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6-dependent tumors and tissues.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2007-05-01,"Cell cycle progression from G(1) to S phase depends on phosphorylation of pRb by complexes containing a cyclin (D type or E type) and cyclin-dependent kinase (e.g., cdk2, cdk4, or cdk6). Ink4 proteins function to oppose the action of cdk4/6-cyclin D complexes by inhibiting cdk4/6. We employed genetic and pharmacologic approaches to study the interplay among Ink4 proteins and cdk4/6 activity in vivo. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) lacking p16(Ink4a) and p18(Ink4c) showed similar growth kinetics as wild-type MEFs despite increased cdk4 activity. In vivo, germline deficiency of p16(Ink4a) and p18(Ink4c) resulted in increased proliferation in the intermediate pituitary and pancreatic islets of adult mice, and survival of p16(Ink4a-/-);p18(Ink4c-/-) mice was significantly reduced due to aggressive pituitary tumors. Compensation among the Ink4 proteins was observed both in vivo in p18(Ink4c-/-) mice and in MEFs from p16(Ink4a-/-), p18(Ink4c-/-), or p16(Ink4a-/-);p18(Ink4c-/-) mice. Treatment with PD 0332991, a specific cdk4/6 kinase inhibitor, abrogated proliferation in those compartments where Ink4 deficiency was associated with enhanced proliferation (i.e., islets, pituitary, and B lymphocytes) but had no effect on proliferation in other tissues such as the small bowel.

Radiosurgery of growth hormone-producing pituitary adenomas: factors associated with biochemical remission.,Journal of neurosurgery,J. Neurosurg.,2007-05-01,"The authors reviewed outcomes after stereotactic radiosurgery for patients with acromegaly and analyzed factors associated with biochemical remission. Retrospective analysis was performed for 46 consecutive cases of growth hormone (GH)-producing pituitary adenomas treated by radiosurgery between 1991 and 2004. Biochemical remission was defined as a fasting GH less than 2 ng/ml and a normal age- and sex-adjusted insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) level while patients were not receiving any pituitary suppressive medications. The median follow up after radiosurgery was 63 months (range 22-168 months). Twenty-three patients (50%) had biochemical remission documented at a median of 36 months (range 6-63 months) after one radiosurgical procedure. The actuarial rates of biochemical remission at 2 and 5 years after radiosurgery were 11 and 60%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that IGF-I levels less than 2.25 times the upper limit of normal (hazard ratio [HR] 2.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-6.9, p = 0.02) and the absence of pituitary suppressive medications at the time of radiosurgery (HR 4.2, 95% CI 1.4-13.2, p = 0.01) correlated with biochemical remission. The incidence of new anterior pituitary deficits was 10% at 2 years and 33% at 5 years. Discontinuation of pituitary suppressive medications at least 1 month before radiosurgery significantly improved endocrine outcomes for patients with acromegaly. Patients with GH-producing pituitary adenomas should not undergo further radiation therapy or surgery for at least 5 years after radiosurgery because GH and IGF-I levels continue to normalize over that interval.",Journal Article,4648.0,118.0,authors reviewed outcomes stereotactic radiosurgery patients acromegaly factors associated biochemical remission Retrospective performed 46 consecutive cases growth hormone GH -producing pituitary adenomas treated radiosurgery 1991 2004 Biochemical remission defined fasting GH 2 ng/ml normal age- sex-adjusted insulin-like growth factor-I IGF-I level patients receiving pituitary suppressive medications median follow radiosurgery 63 months range 22-168 months Twenty-three patients 50 biochemical remission documented median 36 months range 6-63 months radiosurgical procedure actuarial rates biochemical remission 2 5 years radiosurgery 11 60 respectively Multivariate showed IGF-I levels 2.25 times upper limit normal hazard ratio HR 2.9 95 confidence interval CI 1.2-6.9 p 0.02 absence pituitary suppressive medications time radiosurgery HR 4.2 95 CI 1.4-13.2 p 0.01 correlated biochemical remission incidence new anterior pituitary deficits 10 2 years 33 5 years Discontinuation pituitary suppressive medications 1 month radiosurgery significantly improved endocrine outcomes patients acromegaly Patients GH-producing pituitary adenomas undergo radiation therapy surgery 5 years radiosurgery GH IGF-I levels continue normalize interval,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 738, 446, 123, 50, 1729, 2192, 9, 7, 5, 28682, 2, 311, 130, 41, 5, 1487, 734, 459, 65, 10, 173, 9, 641, 935, 140, 1, 129, 785, 4579, 3787, 2751, 73, 20, 2192, 59, 3372, 2, 1131, 1487, 734, 10, 395, 22, 8, 5706, 4579, 299, 76, 18, 997, 542, 2, 8, 295, 89, 2, 1035, 586, 1601, 733, 129, 161, 70, 1273, 70, 301, 369, 7, 11, 44, 357, 500, 3707, 2679, 3, 52, 166, 126, 50, 2192, 10, 676, 53, 184, 350, 5359, 53, 737, 169, 7, 212, 42, 1487, 734, 1405, 28, 8, 52, 1, 511, 53, 184, 49, 676, 53, 50, 104, 17749, 1299, 3, 2361, 151, 1, 1487, 734, 28, 18, 2, 33, 60, 50, 2192, 11, 175, 2, 335, 106, 331, 65, 224, 17, 1273, 70, 148, 299, 76, 18, 243, 1072, 3, 1726, 2385, 1, 295, 360, 197, 168, 18, 83, 48, 307, 268, 58, 14, 18, 49, 83, 19, 13, 588, 2, 3, 1127, 1, 3707, 2679, 28, 3, 98, 1, 2192, 168, 39, 18, 48, 58, 14, 39, 233, 18, 19, 13, 355, 438, 5, 1487, 734, 3, 287, 1, 217, 2882, 2752, 10, 79, 28, 18, 60, 2, 466, 28, 33, 60, 2007, 1, 3707, 2679, 28, 506, 14, 811, 348, 2192, 97, 231, 1293, 123, 9, 7, 5, 28682, 7, 5, 4579, 3787, 2751, 257, 44, 1251, 195, 121, 36, 15, 152, 9, 28, 506, 33, 60, 50, 2192, 408, 4579, 2, 1273, 70, 148, 1906, 6, 13633, 252, 17, 268]",1546.0,17542527,Radiosurgery growth hormone-producing pituitary adenomas factors associated biochemical remission,0,0.0
Association between megestrol acetate treatment and symptomatic adrenal insufficiency with hypogonadism in male patients with cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2007-09-01,"Patients with advanced cancer may develop cachexia, which is often treated with megestrol acetate (MA). In addition to thromboembolic disease, MA may cause symptomatic suppression of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis.

Neuroendocrine effects of androgens in adult polycystic ovary syndrome and female puberty.,Seminars in reproductive medicine,Semin. Reprod. Med.,2007-09-01,"In addition to hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by neuroendocrine abnormalities including a persistently rapid gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse frequency. Rapid GnRH pulsatility favors pituitary secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) over that of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Excess LH stimulates ovarian androgen production, whereas relative deficits in FSH impair follicular development. The rapid GnRH pulse frequency is a result of reduced progesterone-mediated feedback inhibition of the GnRH pulse generator secondary to infrequent luteal phase increases in progesterone, as well as reduced hypothalamic sensitivity to progesterone feedback. Progesterone sensitivity is restored by treatment with the androgen receptor blocker flutamide. As such, hyperandrogenemia appears to play an important pathophysiologic role in PCOS. Adolescent hyperandrogenemia is believed to be a precursor to adult PCOS. In addition to increased LH concentrations and pulse frequency, some girls with elevated androgen levels also demonstrate reduced hypothalamic sensitivity to progesterone feedback. We hypothesize that excess peripubertal androgens may reduce the sensitivity of the GnRH pulse generator to sex steroid inhibition in susceptible individuals, resulting in increased GnRH pulse frequency and subsequent abnormalities in gonadotropin secretion, ovarian androgen production, and ovulatory function. Over time, these abnormalities may progress to the clinical hyperandrogenism and chronic oligo-ovulation typical of adult PCOS.",Journal Article,4525.0,77.0,addition hyperandrogenism ovulatory dysfunction polycystic ovary syndrome PCOS characterized neuroendocrine abnormalities including persistently rapid gonadotropin-releasing hormone GnRH pulse frequency Rapid GnRH pulsatility favors pituitary secretion luteinizing hormone LH follicle-stimulating hormone FSH Excess LH stimulates ovarian androgen production relative deficits FSH impair follicular development rapid GnRH pulse frequency reduced progesterone-mediated feedback inhibition GnRH pulse generator secondary infrequent luteal phase increases progesterone reduced hypothalamic sensitivity progesterone feedback Progesterone sensitivity restored treatment androgen receptor blocker flutamide hyperandrogenemia appears play important pathophysiologic role PCOS Adolescent hyperandrogenemia believed precursor adult PCOS addition increased LH concentrations pulse frequency girls elevated androgen levels demonstrate reduced hypothalamic sensitivity progesterone feedback hypothesize excess peripubertal androgens reduce sensitivity GnRH pulse generator sex steroid inhibition susceptible individuals resulting increased GnRH pulse frequency subsequent abnormalities gonadotropin secretion ovarian androgen production ovulatory function time abnormalities progress clinical hyperandrogenism chronic oligo-ovulation typical adult PCOS,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4, 352, 6, 30354, 2, 21184, 1527, 14153, 3631, 681, 6680, 16, 765, 20, 1542, 1171, 141, 8, 8684, 1321, 6501, 5586, 785, 7926, 7877, 675, 1321, 7926, 38529, 13054, 2935, 1, 8223, 785, 6531, 252, 17, 1, 9109, 2122, 785, 8333, 2612, 6531, 6200, 687, 1529, 547, 580, 2752, 4, 8333, 6267, 1974, 193, 3, 1321, 7926, 7877, 675, 16, 8, 757, 1, 405, 2143, 517, 3983, 297, 1, 3, 7926, 7877, 17706, 568, 6, 4475, 20256, 124, 1106, 4, 2143, 22, 149, 22, 405, 7531, 485, 6, 2143, 3983, 2143, 485, 16, 4138, 20, 24, 5, 3, 687, 153, 8411, 11115, 22, 225, 23414, 1233, 6, 1343, 35, 305, 11575, 200, 4, 6680, 3678, 23414, 16, 3979, 6, 40, 8, 2765, 6, 780, 6680, 4, 352, 6, 101, 6531, 1003, 2, 7877, 675, 476, 5989, 5, 804, 687, 148, 120, 608, 405, 7531, 485, 6, 2143, 3983, 21, 4919, 17, 2612, 38530, 5488, 68, 969, 3, 485, 1, 3, 7926, 7877, 17706, 6, 1035, 3853, 297, 4, 4012, 869, 1113, 4, 101, 7926, 7877, 675, 2, 706, 1171, 4, 6501, 2935, 687, 1529, 2, 21184, 343, 252, 98, 46, 1171, 68, 1466, 6, 3, 38, 30354, 2, 442, 11301, 23193, 3476, 1, 780, 6680]",1550.0,17710731,Neuroendocrine effects androgens adult polycystic ovary syndrome female puberty,0,0.0
Gamma knife radiosurgery for patients with nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas: results from a 15-year experience.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2007-10-29,"To evaluate the efficacy and complications of stereotactic radiosurgery for patients with nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFA). This was a retrospective review of 62 patients with NFA undergoing radiosurgery between 1992 and 2004, of whom 59 (95%) underwent prior tumor resection. The median treatment volume was 4.0 cm(3) (range, 0.8-12.9). The median treatment dose to the tumor margin was 16 Gy (range, 11-20). The median maximum point dose to the optic apparatus was 9.5 Gy (range, 5.0-12.6). The median follow-up period after radiosurgery was 64 months (range, 23-161). Tumor size decreased for 37 patients (60%) and remained unchanged for 23 patients (37%). Two patients (3%) had tumor growth outside the prescribed treatment volume and required additional treatment (fractionated radiation therapy, n = 1; repeat radiosurgery, n = 1). Tumor growth control was 95% at 3 and 7 years after radiosurgery. Eleven (27%) of 41 patients with normal (n = 30) or partial (n = 11) anterior pituitary function before radiosurgery developed new deficits at a median of 24 months after radiosurgery. The risk of developing new anterior pituitary deficits at 5 years was 32%. The 5-year risk of developing new anterior pituitary deficits was 18% for patients with a tumor volume of < or = 4.0 cm(3) compared with 58% for patients with a tumor volume >4.0 cm(3) (risk ratio = 4.5; 95% confidence interval = 1.3-14.9, p = 0.02). No patient had a decline in visual function. Stereotactic radiosurgery is effective in the management of patients with residual or recurrent NFA, although longer follow-up is needed to evaluate long-term outcomes. The primary complication is hypopituitarism, and the risk of developing new anterior pituitary deficits correlates with the size of the irradiated tumor.",Evaluation Study,4467.0,102.0,evaluate efficacy complications stereotactic radiosurgery patients nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas NFA retrospective review 62 patients NFA undergoing radiosurgery 1992 2004 59 95 underwent prior resection median treatment volume 4.0 cm 3 range 0.8-12.9 median treatment dose margin 16 Gy range 11-20 median maximum point dose optic apparatus 9.5 Gy range 5.0-12.6 median follow-up period radiosurgery 64 months range 23-161 size decreased 37 patients 60 remained unchanged 23 patients 37 patients 3 growth outside prescribed treatment volume required additional treatment fractionated radiation therapy n 1 repeat radiosurgery n 1 growth control 95 3 7 years radiosurgery 27 41 patients normal n 30 partial n 11 anterior pituitary function radiosurgery developed new deficits median 24 months radiosurgery risk developing new anterior pituitary deficits 5 years 32 5-year risk developing new anterior pituitary deficits 18 patients volume 4.0 cm 3 compared 58 patients volume 4.0 cm 3 risk ratio 4.5 95 confidence interval 1.3-14.9 p 0.02 patient decline visual function Stereotactic radiosurgery effective management patients residual recurrent NFA longer follow-up needed evaluate long-term outcomes primary complication hypopituitarism risk developing new anterior pituitary deficits correlates size irradiated,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 376, 3, 209, 2, 521, 1, 1729, 2192, 9, 7, 5, 18461, 2751, 24724, 26, 10, 8, 459, 206, 1, 744, 7, 5, 24724, 479, 2192, 59, 2846, 2, 1131, 1, 953, 728, 48, 208, 324, 30, 170, 3, 52, 24, 433, 10, 39, 13, 494, 27, 184, 13, 66, 133, 83, 3, 52, 24, 61, 6, 3, 30, 959, 10, 245, 381, 184, 175, 179, 3, 52, 689, 741, 61, 6, 3, 5670, 10180, 10, 83, 33, 381, 184, 33, 13, 133, 49, 3, 52, 166, 126, 727, 50, 2192, 10, 660, 53, 184, 382, 5377, 30, 444, 340, 9, 567, 7, 335, 2, 958, 4639, 9, 382, 7, 567, 100, 7, 27, 42, 30, 129, 2513, 3, 2746, 24, 433, 2, 616, 402, 24, 3950, 121, 36, 78, 14, 2334, 2192, 78, 14, 30, 129, 182, 10, 48, 28, 27, 2, 67, 60, 50, 2192, 2627, 428, 1, 605, 7, 5, 295, 78, 201, 15, 450, 78, 175, 2882, 343, 348, 2192, 276, 217, 2752, 28, 8, 52, 1, 259, 53, 50, 2192, 3, 43, 1, 931, 217, 2882, 2752, 28, 33, 60, 10, 531, 3, 33, 111, 43, 1, 931, 217, 2882, 2752, 10, 203, 9, 7, 5, 8, 30, 433, 1, 15, 39, 13, 494, 27, 72, 5, 717, 9, 7, 5, 8, 30, 433, 39, 13, 494, 27, 43, 197, 39, 33, 48, 307, 268, 14, 27, 213, 83, 19, 13, 588, 77, 69, 42, 8, 1858, 4, 3046, 343, 1729, 2192, 16, 323, 4, 3, 284, 1, 7, 5, 753, 15, 387, 24724, 242, 589, 166, 126, 16, 575, 6, 376, 319, 337, 123, 3, 86, 1447, 16, 19832, 2, 3, 43, 1, 931, 217, 2882, 2752, 1871, 5, 3, 444, 1, 3, 2398, 30]",1652.0,18029107,Gamma knife radiosurgery patients nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas 15-year experience,14,0.1320754716981132

Clinical data and HP axis radiation dosimetry data were obtained from 88 eligible children. All patients received regular endocrine follow-up that included screening tests of thyroid function and stimulation testing for growth hormone deficiency (GHD), and adrenocorticotropin hormone deficiency. The cumulative incidence of GHD, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiency, adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency, and primary hypothyroidism at 4 years from diagnosis was 93% +/- 4%, 23% +/- 8%, 38% +/- 6%, and 65% +/- 7%, respectively. Radiation dosimetry to the HP axis was associated only with the development of TSH deficiency; the 4-year cumulative incidence was 44% +/- 19% and 11% +/- 8% (P = .014) for those receiving more or less than the median dose to the hypothalamus (>or= 42 v < 42 Gy), respectively. The median dose of CSI for the average-risk (AR) patients was 23.4 and 39.6 Gy (36 to 40.5 Gy) for the high-risk patients.

Genetic predictors of glucocorticoid-induced hypertension in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,Pharmacogenet. Genomics,2008-06-01,"Glucocorticoids are used universally in the remission induction therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). One of the adverse effects of glucocorticoids is hypertension. Our aim was to define the frequency of and clinical and genetic risk factors for steroid-induced hypertension. We determined the genotypes for 203 candidate polymorphisms in genes previously linked to hypertension or to the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of antileukemic agents. Hypertension was defined according to the guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics; patients were evaluated during the 28-day period of prednisone at 40 mg/m2/day during remission induction of childhood ALL. Of the 602 children with newly diagnosed ALL who were normotensive pretherapy, 270 (45%) developed hypertension during remission induction. None of the putative risk factors (age, sex, race, white blood cell count, risk group, body mass index, or serum creatinine) was associated with hypertension.

Novalis intensity-modulated radiosurgery: methods for pretreatment planning.,Neurosurgery,Neurosurgery,2008-05-01,"The Novalis stereotactic radiotherapy system (BrainLAB, Heimstetten, Germany) allows for precise treatment of cranial base tumors with single-fraction radiosurgery. In some cases, however, proximity of the optic nerve and chiasm is a concern. In these cases, intensity-modulated stereotactic radiosurgery (IMRS) can be used to limit the dose to these structures. IMRS planning can be labor intensive, which poses a problem when it is performed on the day of treatment. We describe our methods and results of preprocedure planning for IMRS for patients with lesions in the cavernous sinus or parasellar regions in whom the dose to the optic nerve or chiasm might exceed our acceptable tolerance dose (8 Gy). Patients whose lesions were more than 4 mm from the optic nerve and chiasm on standard magnetic resonance imaging scans but who were questionable candidates for radiosurgery because of concerns of dose to the optic nerve or chiasm were considered for IMRS. Preprocedure imaging (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) was fused and analyzed using the BrainLAB BrainScan 5.3 treatment planning system. Dynamic conformal arc plans for stereotactic radiosurgery and IMRS were evaluated. Doses to the planning target volume and optic apparatus were assessed by dose-volume histograms and conformality index calculated to characterize the quality of the different plans. When IMRS was used, the preplan allowed for a rapid recalculation on the treatment day, minimizing the time patients were in the head frame before treatment. We describe three patients with recurrent pituitary tumors and three with meningiomas. Doses were 1500 to 2000 cGy prescribed to the 80 to 96% isodose line delivered by eight to 22 fields. Tumor volumes ranged from 2.70 to 8.82 cm (mean, 5.7 cm). In five of the six patients, the dynamic conformal arc plan precluded delivery of therapeutic dose without exceeding optic nerve tolerance. On the basis of 95% coverage of target volume, maximum prescription doses of 7.7 to 20.64 Gy were possible with the dynamic conformal arc plans without exceeding 8 Gy to the optic apparatus. IMRS allowed maximum doses of 20 to 31 Gy using the same optic apparatus dose restriction. No complications have occurred, and all tumors have remained stable since treatment (mean follow-up period, 30 mo). We believe this pretreatment technique streamlines the process for IMRS, allowing for better patient comfort and efficient physician time use.",Journal Article,4282.0,9.0,Novalis stereotactic radiotherapy BrainLAB Heimstetten Germany allows precise treatment cranial base single-fraction radiosurgery cases proximity optic nerve chiasm concern cases intensity-modulated stereotactic radiosurgery IMRS limit dose structures IMRS planning labor intensive poses problem performed day treatment methods preprocedure planning IMRS patients lesions cavernous sinus parasellar regions dose optic nerve chiasm exceed acceptable tolerance dose 8 Gy Patients lesions 4 mm optic nerve chiasm standard magnetic resonance imaging scans questionable candidates radiosurgery concerns dose optic nerve chiasm considered IMRS Preprocedure imaging computed tomography magnetic resonance imaging fused BrainLAB BrainScan 5.3 treatment planning Dynamic conformal arc plans stereotactic radiosurgery IMRS evaluated Doses planning target volume optic apparatus assessed dose-volume histograms conformality index calculated characterize quality different plans IMRS preplan allowed rapid recalculation treatment day minimizing time patients head frame treatment patients recurrent pituitary meningiomas Doses 1500 2000 cGy prescribed 80 96 isodose line delivered 22 fields volumes ranged 2.70 8.82 cm mean 5.7 cm patients dynamic conformal arc plan precluded delivery therapeutic dose exceeding optic nerve tolerance basis 95 coverage target volume maximum prescription doses 7.7 20.64 Gy possible dynamic conformal arc plans exceeding 8 Gy optic apparatus IMRS allowed maximum doses 20 31 Gy optic apparatus dose restriction complications occurred remained stable treatment mean follow-up period 30 mo believe pretreatment technique streamlines process IMRS allowing better patient comfort efficient physician time use,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 19158, 1729, 310, 398, 19159, 57206, 10697, 2333, 9, 3260, 24, 1, 2565, 1782, 57, 5, 226, 1509, 2192, 4, 476, 140, 137, 6167, 1, 3, 5670, 2476, 2, 14583, 16, 8, 2893, 4, 46, 140, 837, 1757, 1729, 2192, 13169, 122, 40, 95, 6, 2385, 3, 61, 6, 46, 2414, 13169, 1349, 122, 40, 9557, 1686, 92, 7056, 8, 2497, 198, 192, 16, 173, 23, 3, 218, 1, 24, 21, 897, 114, 636, 2, 99, 1, 34494, 1349, 9, 13169, 9, 7, 5, 406, 4, 3, 12170, 5810, 15, 18260, 1374, 4, 953, 3, 61, 6, 3, 5670, 2476, 15, 14583, 822, 6818, 114, 1595, 2614, 61, 66, 381, 7, 1310, 406, 11, 80, 76, 39, 321, 29, 3, 5670, 2476, 2, 14583, 23, 260, 1484, 1535, 270, 1441, 84, 54, 11, 14853, 1931, 9, 2192, 408, 1, 2061, 1, 61, 6, 3, 5670, 2476, 15, 14583, 11, 515, 9, 13169, 34494, 270, 1220, 872, 2, 1484, 1535, 270, 10, 6263, 2, 311, 75, 3, 19159, 26723, 33, 27, 24, 1349, 398, 2540, 2972, 9277, 1853, 9, 1729, 2192, 2, 13169, 11, 194, 415, 6, 3, 1349, 283, 433, 2, 5670, 10180, 11, 275, 20, 61, 433, 8638, 2, 12025, 558, 981, 6, 1507, 3, 372, 1, 3, 338, 1853, 198, 13169, 10, 95, 3, 57207, 2313, 9, 8, 1321, 57208, 23, 3, 24, 218, 4501, 3, 98, 7, 11, 4, 3, 718, 5331, 348, 24, 21, 897, 169, 7, 5, 387, 57, 2, 169, 5, 3718, 415, 11, 7204, 6, 1081, 3071, 2746, 6, 3, 493, 6, 921, 8945, 328, 1623, 20, 659, 6, 350, 3130, 30, 2225, 1869, 29, 18, 431, 6, 66, 878, 494, 313, 33, 67, 494, 4, 365, 1, 3, 437, 7, 3, 2540, 2972, 9277, 2242, 8035, 989, 1, 189, 61, 187, 5178, 5670, 2476, 2614, 23, 3, 877, 1, 48, 2139, 1, 283, 433, 689, 3584, 415, 1, 67, 67, 6, 179, 660, 381, 11, 899, 5, 3, 2540, 2972, 9277, 1853, 187, 5178, 66, 381, 6, 3, 5670, 10180, 13169, 2313, 689, 415, 1, 179, 6, 456, 381, 75, 3, 827, 5670, 10180, 61, 4575, 77, 521, 47, 489, 2, 62, 57, 47, 958, 585, 1192, 24, 313, 166, 126, 727, 201, 2035, 21, 4629, 26, 1194, 1312, 31293, 3, 1129, 9, 13169, 2952, 9, 380, 69, 8300, 2, 2547, 1473, 98, 119]",2415.0,18580777,Novalis intensity-modulated radiosurgery methods pretreatment planning,0,0.0

Pituitary tumor type affects the chance of biochemical remission after radiosurgery of hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas.,Neurosurgery,Neurosurgery,2008-06-01,"Reported biochemical remission rates have ranged widely after stereotactic radiosurgery for patients with hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas. Confounding variables include histology, radiation dose, use of pituitary-suppressive medications, and length of follow-up. A retrospective review of 46 patients with pituitary adenomas (growth hormone-secreting, n = 27; prolactin-secreting, n = 11; adrenocorticotropin-secreting, n = 8) undergoing radiosurgery between January 1990 and December 2003 was conducted. All received a tumor margin dose of 18 Gy or more and were off pituitary-suppressive medications for at least 1 month before radiosurgery. The groups were similar with regard to irradiated volume, radiation dose, and follow-up. The median endocrinological follow-up after radiosurgery was 54 months. The 4-year remission rates were 87% for patients with Cushing's disease, 67% for patients with acromegaly, and 18% for patients with prolactinomas. Patients with oversecretion of adrenocorticotropin or growth hormone were more likely to achieve remission after radiosurgery than patients with prolactinomas (hazard ratio, 4.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-18.2; P = 0.04). Of 44 patients with normal or partial anterior pituitary function before radiosurgery, 16 (36%) developed one or more new anterior pituitary deficits. The incidence of new anterior pituitary deficits was 26% at 4 years. No differences were noted in the incidence of new anterior deficits among the groups.

The diagnosis and treatment of a childhood malignancy prior to the onset of puberty has the potential to profoundly affect the timing and the tempo of puberty. CNS tumors located in the hypothalamic-pituitary (H-P) region, surgical resection in this location, and exposure to CNS radiotherapy are all associated with both precocious and delayed puberty. Also, chemotherapy and radiation can directly damage the gonads, which can result in absent, arrested, or delayed puberty. As a consequence of these alterations of pubertal timing, both male and female survivors of childhood cancer may be at risk of adult short-stature, decreased bone-mineral density, absent or incomplete sexual development, and ultimately, reduced rates of fertility. Appropriate and timely assessment of survivors at high risk of alterations in pubertal development will enable the identification of patients who would benefit from early medical intervention.",Journal Article,3976.0,26.0,onset puberty marks time rapid linear growth sexual development transition childhood maturity diagnosis treatment childhood malignancy prior onset puberty potential profoundly affect timing tempo puberty CNS located hypothalamic-pituitary H-P region surgical resection location exposure CNS radiotherapy associated precocious delayed puberty chemotherapy radiation directly damage gonads absent arrested delayed puberty consequence alterations pubertal timing male female survivors childhood risk adult short-stature decreased bone-mineral density absent incomplete sexual development ultimately reduced rates fertility Appropriate timely assessment survivors high risk alterations pubertal development enable identification patients benefit early medical intervention,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1707, 1, 10302, 8418, 8, 98, 1, 1321, 1646, 129, 2232, 193, 2, 1970, 29, 864, 6, 26674, 3, 147, 2, 24, 1, 8, 864, 710, 324, 6, 3, 1707, 1, 10302, 71, 3, 174, 6, 8802, 1158, 3, 1972, 2, 3, 30554, 1, 10302, 1025, 57, 2308, 4, 3, 7531, 12098, 555, 19, 1053, 221, 170, 4, 26, 1147, 2, 645, 6, 1025, 310, 32, 62, 41, 5, 110, 26266, 2, 1612, 10302, 120, 56, 2, 121, 122, 1606, 1350, 3, 23245, 92, 122, 757, 4, 3269, 9762, 15, 1612, 10302, 22, 8, 4177, 1, 46, 593, 1, 10467, 1972, 110, 1045, 2, 1061, 332, 1, 864, 12, 68, 40, 28, 43, 1, 780, 978, 13576, 340, 3417, 5033, 1263, 3269, 15, 2610, 2232, 193, 2, 2050, 405, 151, 1, 2954, 870, 2, 4225, 455, 1, 332, 28, 64, 43, 1, 593, 4, 10467, 193, 303, 3047, 3, 911, 1, 7, 54, 688, 247, 29, 191, 484, 788]",1034.0,19293602,Alterations pubertal timing following therapy childhood malignancies,1,0.009433962264150943
Abnormal timing of menarche in survivors of central nervous system tumors: A report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,Cancer,Cancer,2009-06-01,"Children who receive high-dose radiotherapy to the hypothalamic-pituitary (H-P) axis may be at risk for both early and late puberty. To the authors' knowledge, data regarding the risk of altered timing of menarche after higher dose radiotherapy (RT), as used in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, are limited. The authors evaluated 235 female survivors of CNS tumors, diagnosed between 1970 and 1986, and >1000 sibling controls who were participants in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, and provided self-reported data concerning age at menarche. Survivors of CNS tumors were more likely to have onset of menarche before age 10 years compared with their siblings (11.9% vs 1.0%) (odds ratio [OR], 14.1; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 7.0-30.9). Of the 138 survivors who received RT to the H-P axis, 20 (14.5%) had onset of menarche before age 10 years, compared with 4.3% of those who did not receive RT (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.2-16.5). Age <or=4 years at the time of diagnosis was associated with an increased risk (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.7-10.0) of early menarche. In addition, survivors of CNS tumors were more likely than siblings to have onset of menarche after age 16 years (10.6% vs 1.9%) (OR, 6.6; 95% CI, 3.4-11.4). Doses of RT to the H-P axis >50 gray OR, 9.0; 95% CI, 2.3-59.5) and spinal RT conferred an increased risk of late menarche, as did older age (>10 years) at the time of diagnosis (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.3-7.0).

Clin. Oncol.,2009-04-13,"This study was undertaken to determine the effect, if any, of treatment for cancer diagnosed during childhood or adolescence on fertility. We reviewed the fertility of female participants in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS), which consisted of 5-year survivors, and a cohort of randomly selected siblings who responded to a questionnaire. Medical records of all members of the cohort were abstracted to obtain chemotherapeutic agents administered; the cumulative dose of drug administered for several drugs of interest; and the doses, volumes, and dates of administration of all radiation therapy. There were 5,149 female CCSS participants, and there were 1,441 female siblings of CCSS participants who were age 15 to 44 years. The relative risk (RR) for survivors of ever being pregnant was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.73 to 0.90; P < .001) compared with female siblings. In multivariate models among survivors only, those who received a hypothalamic/pituitary radiation dose > or = 30 Gy (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.83) or an ovarian/uterine radiation dose greater than 5 Gy were less likely to have ever been pregnant (RR, 0.56 for 5 to 10 Gy; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.85; RR, 0.18 for > 10 Gy; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.26). Those with a summed alkylating agent dose (AAD) score of three or four or who were treated with lomustine or cyclophosphamide were less likely to have ever been pregnant.

We studied the association between breast cancer risk and polymorphisms in genes that code for GNRH1 and its receptor (GNRHR) in the large National Cancer Institute Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (NCI-BPC3). We sequenced exons of GNRH1 and GNRHR in 95 invasive breast cancer cases. Resulting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped and used to identify haplotype-tagging SNPs (htSNPS) in a panel of 349 healthy women. The htSNPs were genotyped in 5,603 invasive breast cancer cases and 7,480 controls from the Cancer Prevention Study-II (CPS-II), European Prospective Investigation on Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), Multiethnic Cohort (MEC), Nurses' Health Study (NHS), and Women's Health Study (WHS). Circulating levels of sex steroids (androstenedione, estradiol, estrone and testosterone) were also measured in 4713 study subjects. Breast cancer risk was not associated with any polymorphism or haplotype in the GNRH1 and GNRHR genes, nor were there any statistically significant interactions with known breast cancer risk factors. Polymorphisms in these two genes were not strongly associated with circulating hormone levels. Common variants of the GNRH1 and GNRHR genes are not associated with risk of invasive breast cancer in Caucasians.",Journal Article,3828.0,5.0,"Gonadotropin releasing hormone GNRH1 triggers release follicle stimulating hormone luteinizing hormone pituitary Genetic encoding GNRH1 receptor influence breast risk modulating production ovarian steroid hormones studied association breast risk polymorphisms code GNRH1 receptor GNRHR large National Institute Breast Prostate Cohort Consortium NCI-BPC3 sequenced exons GNRH1 GNRHR 95 invasive breast cases Resulting single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs genotyped identify haplotype-tagging SNPs htSNPS panel 349 healthy women htSNPs genotyped 5,603 invasive breast cases 7,480 controls Prevention Study-II CPS-II European Prospective Investigation Nutrition EPIC Multiethnic Cohort MEC Nurses Health NHS Women 's Health WHS Circulating levels sex steroids androstenedione estradiol estrone testosterone measured 4713 subjects Breast risk associated polymorphism haplotype GNRH1 GNRHR statistically significant interactions known breast risk factors Polymorphisms strongly associated circulating hormone levels Common GNRH1 GNRHR associated risk invasive breast Caucasians",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6501, 5586, 785, 28931, 5951, 3, 2008, 1, 9109, 2122, 785, 2, 8223, 785, 29, 3, 336, 839, 4, 3, 145, 2362, 28931, 15, 211, 153, 68, 1054, 12, 43, 20, 3712, 1529, 1, 3853, 4927, 21, 656, 3, 248, 59, 12, 43, 2, 1203, 4, 214, 17, 5853, 9, 28931, 2, 211, 153, 34729, 4, 3, 375, 657, 12, 1377, 2, 12, 180, 2404, 2580, 22552, 21, 4040, 3885, 1, 28931, 2, 34729, 4, 48, 416, 12, 140, 1113, 226, 1579, 1203, 1109, 11, 3053, 2, 95, 6, 255, 4179, 9389, 1109, 26682, 4, 8, 993, 1, 9043, 1331, 117, 3, 26682, 11, 3053, 4, 33, 9696, 416, 12, 140, 2, 67, 9108, 535, 29, 3, 12, 1070, 45, 215, 6987, 215, 1865, 482, 940, 23, 12, 2, 5260, 8995, 17756, 180, 7391, 2707, 341, 45, 8157, 2, 117, 292, 341, 45, 45630, 1033, 148, 1, 1035, 4580, 10310, 4507, 11009, 2, 2660, 11, 120, 644, 4, 37776, 45, 976, 12, 43, 10, 44, 41, 5, 500, 1907, 15, 4179, 4, 3, 28931, 2, 34729, 214, 2110, 11, 125, 500, 712, 93, 1286, 5, 440, 12, 43, 130, 1203, 4, 46, 100, 214, 11, 44, 1327, 41, 5, 1033, 785, 148, 186, 839, 1, 3, 28931, 2, 34729, 214, 32, 44, 41, 5, 43, 1, 416, 12, 4, 5396]",1431.0,19640273,Genetic polymorphisms GNRH1 GNRHR risk breast National Institute Breast Prostate Cohort Consortium BPC3,0,0.0
Hormonal therapy for prostate cancer: toward further unraveling of androgen receptor function.,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,2009-12-01,"Prostate cancer is a major cause of cancer-related death in men. Prostate cancer is an androgen-responsive tumor and the treatment of advanced prostate cancer involves hormonal therapy. First-line treatment for advanced prostate cancer is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), usually with agents that suppress gonadotropins through a pituitary mechanism. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists and antagonists both suppress gonadal release of testosterone, although their activity profiles vary. ADT down-regulates androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity in the tumor but the response in metastatic disease is transient and tumors progress as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Although serum testosterone concentrations decline dramatically with ADT, CRPC growth remains largely dependent on AR activity. Secondary hormonal therapies are then often employed to further dampen AR-driven transcription. These secondary hormonal therapies either further deplete adrenal or intratumoral androgen synthesis, or directly and competitively antagonize AR. New hormonal agents with both of these mechanisms are in clinical trials and show promising activity in patients with CRPC. Abiraterone acetate is an inhibitor of CYP17, which is an enzyme required for the synthesis of all androgens and estrogens. MDV3100 is an AR antagonist that has a higher affinity for AR than any other AR antagonist in clinic use. In phase I and phase II clinical trials, both agents have significant activity. These agents and the promise of the development of others provide hope that more effective hormonal therapies may soon be offered to patients, which will improve clinical outcomes.",Journal Article,3703.0,9.0,Prostate major cause cancer-related death men Prostate androgen-responsive treatment advanced prostate involves hormonal therapy First-line treatment advanced prostate androgen deprivation therapy ADT usually agents suppress gonadotropins pituitary mechanism Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists antagonists suppress gonadal release testosterone activity profiles vary ADT down-regulates androgen receptor AR transcriptional activity response metastatic disease transient progress castration-resistant prostate CRPC serum testosterone concentrations decline dramatically ADT CRPC growth remains largely dependent AR activity Secondary hormonal therapies employed dampen AR-driven transcription secondary hormonal therapies deplete adrenal intratumoral androgen synthesis directly competitively antagonize AR New hormonal agents mechanisms clinical trials promising activity patients CRPC Abiraterone acetate inhibitor CYP17 enzyme required synthesis androgens estrogens MDV3100 AR antagonist higher affinity AR AR antagonist clinic use phase phase II clinical trials agents significant activity agents promise development provide hope effective hormonal therapies soon offered patients improve clinical outcomes,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[12, 16, 8, 458, 708, 1, 12, 139, 273, 4, 325, 12, 16, 35, 687, 2443, 30, 2, 3, 24, 1, 131, 12, 2921, 1761, 36, 157, 328, 24, 9, 131, 12, 16, 687, 1868, 36, 1360, 2082, 5, 183, 17, 3134, 34749, 298, 8, 670, 6501, 5586, 785, 4774, 2, 4444, 110, 3134, 7999, 2008, 1, 2660, 242, 136, 128, 1241, 2825, 1360, 1328, 2468, 687, 153, 754, 1431, 128, 4, 3, 30, 84, 3, 51, 4, 113, 34, 16, 2473, 2, 57, 1466, 22, 1517, 436, 12, 1752, 242, 524, 2660, 1003, 1858, 2729, 5, 1360, 1752, 129, 469, 1733, 470, 23, 754, 128, 568, 1761, 235, 32, 818, 629, 2516, 6, 195, 19142, 754, 1621, 866, 46, 568, 1761, 235, 361, 195, 9450, 2987, 15, 2074, 687, 2525, 15, 1606, 2, 15884, 12718, 754, 217, 1761, 183, 5, 110, 1, 46, 483, 32, 4, 38, 143, 2, 514, 721, 128, 4, 7, 5, 1752, 2260, 3424, 16, 35, 230, 1, 9997, 92, 16, 35, 1644, 616, 9, 3, 2525, 1, 62, 5488, 2, 6293, 11516, 16, 35, 754, 3137, 17, 71, 8, 142, 3601, 9, 754, 76, 500, 127, 754, 3137, 4, 1188, 119, 4, 124, 70, 2, 124, 215, 38, 143, 110, 183, 47, 93, 128, 46, 183, 2, 3, 1783, 1, 3, 193, 1, 1749, 377, 3045, 17, 80, 323, 1761, 235, 68, 6176, 40, 2216, 6, 7, 92, 303, 401, 38, 123]",1600.0,19719456,Hormonal therapy prostate unraveling androgen receptor function,0,0.0

Complications and death among elderly patients undergoing pituitary tumour surgery.,Clinical endocrinology,Clin. Endocrinol. (Oxf),2010-04-23,"Preoperative determinants of surgical risk in elderly patients with pituitary tumour are not fully defined. The aim of this study was to quantify operative risk for these patients. We performed a retrospective analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (1998-2005), a database containing discharge information from a stratified, random sample of 20% of all non-federal hospitals in 37 states. Patients >65 years old who underwent pituitary tumour resection were identified by ICD-9 coding. Primary outcome was inpatient death. Other outcomes included post-operative complications, length of stay (LOS) and total charges. A total of 8400 patients (53.7% male) were identified. Mean age was 72.2. Mean co-morbidity score was 5.3. A majority were white (82.0%) admitted to academic hospitals (69.5%) for elective procedures (55.7%). Inpatient mortality was 3.8%. The most common complication was fluid and electrolyte abnormalities (14.3%). Mean LOS was 8.5 days.

Overall and progression-free survival and visual and endocrine outcomes for patients with parasellar lesions treated with intensity-modulated stereotactic radiosurgery.,Journal of neuro-oncology,J. Neurooncol.,2010-05-12,"Linear accelerator single-fraction radiosurgery (SRS) for skull base lesions is usually delivered with dynamic conformal arcs (DCAs), but intensity-modulated radiosurgery (IMRS) is another option when SRS dose is limited by proximity of the optic nerve and chiasm. We review the long-term outcome of patients treated with IMRS for parasellar lesions. Fourteen patients with parasellar lesions were treated with IMRS when standard DCA radiosurgery was limited by optic nerve tolerance. Prospective patient data included endocrine function, visual acuity and field testing, nonoptic nerve cranial neuropathy, and overall survival. In addition, tumor control on serial magnetic resonance imaging is reported as progression-free survival (PFS). Six patients with cavernous sinus meningiomas and eight with recurrent pituitary adenomas were treated. Three of the pituitary tumors were hormonally active (two with Cushing disease, one with acromegaly). The median patient age was 50 years (range 24-70 years). Median follow-up was 54 months. Average tumor treatment volume was 4.99 ml (average dose 16 Gy, average of 10 IMRS fields). Tumor control was achieved in 11 of 14 (79%) patients. Median PFS has not been reached in our patient population. Thirteen patients are alive (one died of an unrelated cancer). No patients developed new endocrinological, ophthalmological, or cranial nerve deficits. IMRS allows for treatment of parasellar lesions when standard DCA SRS is limited by optic nerve tolerance. Although our follow-up period was relatively short and the number of patients was small, it appears that this can be accomplished with a high tumor control rate and survival without new endocrinopathies, optic neuropathies, or other complications in patients who have failed other therapies.",Journal Article,3541.0,5.0,Linear accelerator single-fraction radiosurgery SRS skull base lesions usually delivered dynamic conformal arcs DCAs intensity-modulated radiosurgery IMRS option SRS dose limited proximity optic nerve chiasm review long-term outcome patients treated IMRS parasellar lesions Fourteen patients parasellar lesions treated IMRS standard DCA radiosurgery limited optic nerve tolerance Prospective patient included endocrine function visual acuity field testing nonoptic nerve cranial neuropathy overall survival addition control serial magnetic resonance imaging reported progression-free survival PFS patients cavernous sinus meningiomas recurrent pituitary adenomas treated pituitary hormonally active Cushing disease acromegaly median patient age 50 years range 24-70 years Median follow-up 54 months Average treatment volume 4.99 ml average dose 16 Gy average 10 IMRS fields control achieved 11 14 79 patients Median PFS reached patient population Thirteen patients alive died unrelated patients developed new endocrinological ophthalmological cranial nerve deficits IMRS allows treatment parasellar lesions standard DCA SRS limited optic nerve tolerance follow-up period relatively short number patients small appears accomplished high control rate survival new endocrinopathies optic neuropathies complications patients failed therapies,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1646, 10290, 226, 1509, 2192, 1429, 9, 5054, 1782, 406, 16, 2082, 1623, 5, 2540, 2972, 18507, 58942, 84, 837, 1757, 2192, 13169, 16, 1809, 1501, 198, 1429, 61, 16, 383, 20, 6167, 1, 3, 5670, 2476, 2, 14583, 21, 206, 3, 319, 337, 228, 1, 7, 73, 5, 13169, 9, 18260, 406, 3225, 7, 5, 18260, 406, 11, 73, 5, 13169, 198, 260, 11046, 2192, 10, 383, 20, 5670, 2476, 2614, 482, 69, 74, 159, 1293, 343, 3046, 11171, 2, 1067, 471, 46031, 2476, 2565, 1751, 2, 63, 25, 4, 352, 30, 182, 23, 2108, 1484, 1535, 270, 16, 210, 22, 91, 115, 25, 300, 437, 7, 5, 12170, 5810, 3718, 2, 659, 5, 387, 2751, 11, 73, 169, 1, 3, 57, 11, 10710, 544, 100, 5, 16258, 34, 104, 5, 28682, 3, 52, 69, 89, 10, 212, 60, 184, 259, 431, 60, 52, 166, 126, 10, 667, 53, 1011, 30, 24, 433, 10, 39, 1058, 542, 1011, 61, 245, 381, 1011, 1, 79, 13169, 3130, 30, 182, 10, 513, 4, 175, 1, 213, 842, 7, 52, 300, 71, 44, 85, 1300, 4, 114, 69, 266, 3170, 7, 32, 1701, 104, 1016, 1, 35, 2092, 12, 77, 7, 276, 217, 28148, 39322, 15, 2565, 2476, 2752, 13169, 2333, 9, 24, 1, 18260, 406, 198, 260, 11046, 1429, 16, 383, 20, 5670, 2476, 2614, 242, 114, 166, 126, 727, 10, 1352, 978, 2, 3, 207, 1, 7, 10, 302, 192, 1233, 17, 26, 122, 40, 5741, 5, 8, 64, 30, 182, 116, 2, 25, 187, 217, 12081, 5670, 12987, 15, 127, 521, 4, 7, 54, 47, 1551, 127, 235]",1725.0,20461446,Overall progression-free survival visual endocrine outcomes patients parasellar lesions treated intensity-modulated stereotactic radiosurgery,0,0.0
Factors associated with endocrine deficits after stereotactic radiosurgery of pituitary adenomas.,Neurosurgery,Neurosurgery,2010-07-01,"To analyze the factors associated with anterior pituitary deficits after pituitary adenoma stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The tumor, pituitary stalk, and pituitary gland were segmented on the dose plans of 82 patients (secreting tumors, n = 53; nonsecreting tumors, n=29) for dose-volume analysis. No patient had undergone prior radiation therapy and all patients had at least 12 months of endocrinological follow-up (median, 63 months; mean, 69 months; range, 13-134). Thirty-four patients (41%) developed new anterior pituitary deficits at a median of 32 months (range, 2-118) after SRS. The risk of developing new anterior pituitary deficits was 16% and 45% at 2 and 5 years, respectively. Multivariate analysis of the entire group showed that poor visualization of the pituitary gland (hazard ratio [HR]=2.63, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.10-6.25, P=.03) was associated with a higher rate of new anterior pituitary deficits. Dosimetric analysis of 60 patients whose pituitary gland could be clearly identified showed that increasing mean pituitary gland radiation dose correlated with new anterior pituitary deficits (HR=1.11, 95% CI=1.02-1.20, P=.02). New anterior pituitary deficits stratified by mean pituitary gland radiation dose: <or=7.5 Gy, 0% (0/7); 7.6 to 13.2 Gy, 29% (7/24); 13.3 to 19.1 Gy, 39% (9/23); >19.1 Gy, 83% (5/6).

Stillbirth and neonatal death in relation to radiation exposure before conception: a retrospective cohort study.,"Lancet (London, England)",Lancet,2010-07-23,"The reproductive implications of mutagenic treatments given to children with cancer are not clear. By studying the risk of untoward pregnancy outcomes, we indirectly assessed the risk of transmission of germline damage to the offspring of survivors of childhood cancer who were given radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We did a retrospective cohort analysis, within the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS), of the risk of stillbirth and neonatal death among the offspring of men and women who had survived childhood cancer. Patients in CCSS were younger than 21 years at initial diagnosis of an eligible cancer, were treated at 25 US institutions and one Canadian institution, and had survived for at least 5 years after diagnosis. We quantified the chemotherapy given to patients, and the preconception radiation doses to the testes, ovaries, uterus, and pituitary gland, and related these to the risk of stillbirth or neonatal death using Poisson regression analysis. Among 1148 men and 1657 women who had survived childhood cancer, there were 4946 pregnancies. Irradiation of the testes (16 [1%] of 1270; adjusted relative risk 0.8 [95% CI 0.4-1.6]; mean dose 0.53 Gy [SD 1.40]) and pituitary gland (17 [3%] of 510, 1.1 [0.5-2.4] for more than 20.00 Gy; mean dose 10.20 Gy [13.0] for women), and chemotherapy with alkylating drugs (26 [2%] of 1195 women, 0.9 [0.5-1.5]; ten [1%] of 732 men, 1.2 [0.5-2.5]) were not associated with an increased risk of stillbirth or neonatal death. Uterine and ovarian irradiation significantly increased risk of stillbirth and neonatal death at doses greater than 10.00 Gy (five [18%] of 28, 9.1 [3.4-24.6]). For girls treated before menarche, irradiation of the uterus and ovaries at doses as low as 1.00-2.49 Gy significantly increased the risk of stillbirth or neonatal death (three [4%] of 69, 4.7 [1.2-19.0]). Our findings do not support concern about heritable genetic changes affecting the risk of stillbirth and neonatal death in the offspring of men exposed to gonadal irradiation.

Temozolomide treatment for aggressive pituitary tumors: correlation of clinical outcome with O(6)-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation and expression.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2010-07-28,"The typically indolent behavior of pituitary tumors is juxtaposed with high rates of tumor cell invasion into adjacent dural structures, and occasional aggressive behavior. Although clinically significant invasion and malignant transformation remain uncommon, there are limited treatment options available for the management of these aggressive tumors. Recently, case reports have described efficacy of temozolomide for the treatment of aggressive pituitary tumors. Seven patients with aggressive pituitary tumors have been treated with temozolomide. We compared O(6)-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation and MGMT expression in 14 surgical specimens from these seven patients and correlated these molecular features with the clinical response to temozolomide. Significant tumor regression was seen in two patients (29%), a 20% reduction in tumor volume with subsequent stable tumor size was noted in one patient, arrest of tumor growth occurred in three patients, and progressive metastatic disease developed during treatment in one patient. The DNA promoter site for MGMT was unmethylated in all 14 adequate specimens, and variable MGMT expression was seen in all 14 cases. There was no correlation between MGMT expression and clinical outcomes. We conclude that medical therapy with temozolomide can be helpful in the management of life-threatening pituitary tumors that have failed to respond to conventional treatments. The optimal duration of treatment in patients with stabilization or reduction of tumor size has not been established, and long-term follow up studies are needed.",Journal Article,3464.0,,typically indolent behavior pituitary juxtaposed high rates invasion adjacent dural structures occasional aggressive behavior clinically significant invasion malignant transformation remain uncommon limited treatment options available management aggressive Recently case reports described efficacy temozolomide treatment aggressive pituitary Seven patients aggressive pituitary treated temozolomide compared 6 -methylguanine methyltransferase MGMT promoter methylation MGMT expression 14 surgical specimens seven patients correlated molecular features clinical response temozolomide Significant regression seen patients 29 20 reduction volume subsequent stable size noted patient arrest growth occurred patients progressive metastatic disease developed treatment patient DNA promoter site MGMT unmethylated 14 adequate specimens variable MGMT expression seen 14 cases correlation MGMT expression clinical outcomes conclude medical therapy temozolomide helpful management life-threatening pituitary failed respond conventional treatments optimal duration treatment patients stabilization reduction size established long-term follow studies needed,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1969, 2316, 1710, 1, 57, 16, 25995, 5, 64, 151, 1, 30, 31, 578, 237, 2086, 11124, 2414, 2, 9753, 571, 1710, 242, 505, 93, 578, 2, 393, 1392, 918, 2052, 125, 32, 383, 24, 838, 390, 9, 3, 284, 1, 46, 571, 57, 761, 473, 1198, 47, 1027, 209, 1, 1537, 9, 3, 24, 1, 571, 57, 648, 7, 5, 571, 57, 47, 85, 73, 5, 1537, 21, 72, 1990, 49, 7015, 3747, 2661, 973, 569, 2, 2661, 55, 4, 213, 221, 623, 29, 46, 648, 7, 2, 438, 46, 219, 404, 5, 3, 38, 51, 6, 1537, 93, 30, 320, 10, 527, 4, 100, 7, 462, 8, 179, 628, 4, 30, 433, 5, 706, 585, 30, 444, 10, 1051, 4, 104, 69, 1854, 1, 30, 129, 489, 4, 169, 7, 2, 1014, 113, 34, 276, 190, 24, 4, 104, 69, 3, 261, 973, 606, 9, 2661, 10, 8100, 4, 62, 213, 1658, 623, 2, 1347, 2661, 55, 10, 527, 4, 62, 213, 140, 125, 10, 77, 816, 59, 2661, 55, 2, 38, 123, 21, 2060, 17, 484, 36, 5, 1537, 122, 40, 3951, 4, 3, 284, 1, 358, 3691, 57, 17, 47, 1551, 6, 1892, 6, 809, 640, 3, 665, 654, 1, 24, 4, 7, 5, 3184, 15, 628, 1, 30, 444, 71, 44, 85, 635, 2, 319, 337, 166, 126, 94, 32, 575]",1544.0,20668043,Temozolomide treatment aggressive pituitary correlation clinical outcome 6 -methylguanine methyltransferase MGMT promoter methylation expression,1,0.009433962264150943
Reproductive outcomes for survivors of childhood cancer.,Obstetrics and gynecology,Obstet Gynecol,2010-11-01,"Because of remarkable progress in therapy, long-term survival is expected for 80% of children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer. Infertility remains one of the most common and life-altering complications experienced by adults treated for cancer during childhood. Surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy that negatively affects any component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis may compromise reproductive outcomes in childhood cancer survivors. The risk of infertility is generally related to the tissues or organs involved in cancer and the specific type, dose, and combination of cytotoxic therapy. In addition to anticancer therapy, age at treatment, sex, and likely genetic factors influence the risk of permanent infertility. When possible, contemporary protocols limit cumulative doses of cytotoxic therapy in an effort to optimize reproductive potential. If sterilizing therapy is required for cancer control, then fertility preservation measures should be explored before initiation of therapy. For childhood cancer survivors who maintain fertility, health risks to offspring resulting from their cancer treatment are major concerns. Radiation affecting ovarian and uterine function has been linked to pregnancy complications, including spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, fetal malposition, and low birth weight. The risk of congenital malformations, genetic disorders, and cancer appears to be low, with the exception of cancer risk in offspring born to survivors with germline cancer-predisposing mutations. This review summarizes research about cancer treatment factors affecting fertility and pregnancy outcomes of childhood cancer survivors. The data presented should facilitate the delivery of preventive counseling and age- and sex-appropriate interventions to optimize reproductive outcomes in childhood cancer survivors.",Journal Article,3368.0,80.0,remarkable progress therapy long-term survival expected 80 children adolescents diagnosed Infertility remains common life-altering complications experienced adults treated childhood Surgery radiation chemotherapy negatively affects component hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis compromise reproductive outcomes childhood survivors risk infertility generally related tissues organs involved specific type dose combination cytotoxic therapy addition anticancer therapy age treatment sex likely genetic factors influence risk permanent infertility possible contemporary protocols limit cumulative doses cytotoxic therapy effort optimize reproductive potential sterilizing therapy required control fertility preservation measures explored initiation therapy childhood survivors maintain fertility health risks offspring resulting treatment major concerns Radiation affecting ovarian uterine function linked pregnancy complications including spontaneous abortion preterm labor fetal malposition low birth weight risk congenital malformations genetic disorders appears low exception risk offspring born survivors germline cancer-predisposing review summarizes research treatment factors affecting fertility pregnancy outcomes childhood survivors presented facilitate delivery preventive counseling age- sex-appropriate interventions optimize reproductive outcomes childhood survivors,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[408, 1, 3813, 1466, 4, 36, 319, 337, 25, 16, 1336, 9, 493, 1, 541, 2, 3101, 265, 5, 12, 5901, 469, 104, 1, 3, 96, 186, 2, 358, 4831, 521, 592, 20, 857, 73, 9, 12, 190, 864, 152, 121, 15, 56, 17, 2723, 2561, 500, 1249, 1, 3, 7531, 12098, 7999, 2310, 68, 4665, 3705, 123, 4, 864, 12, 332, 3, 43, 1, 5901, 16, 1228, 139, 6, 3, 742, 15, 2285, 646, 4, 12, 2, 3, 112, 267, 61, 2, 150, 1, 759, 36, 4, 352, 6, 1475, 36, 89, 28, 24, 1035, 2, 322, 336, 130, 1054, 3, 43, 1, 4377, 5901, 198, 899, 2667, 2189, 2385, 967, 415, 1, 759, 36, 4, 35, 2919, 6, 2465, 3705, 174, 492, 59465, 36, 16, 616, 9, 12, 182, 818, 2954, 2224, 1018, 257, 40, 1443, 348, 1118, 1, 36, 9, 864, 12, 332, 54, 3040, 2954, 341, 1098, 6, 8304, 1113, 29, 136, 12, 24, 32, 458, 2061, 121, 2319, 2, 343, 71, 85, 1199, 6, 2290, 521, 141, 3280, 21938, 20525, 9557, 6698, 30250, 2, 154, 3809, 924, 3, 43, 1, 6711, 11756, 336, 1997, 2, 12, 1233, 6, 40, 154, 5, 3, 4188, 1, 12, 43, 4, 8304, 8234, 6, 332, 5, 1009, 12, 6885, 138, 26, 206, 2869, 389, 545, 12, 24, 130, 2319, 2954, 2, 2290, 123, 1, 864, 12, 332, 3, 74, 917, 257, 1876, 3, 989, 1, 3494, 2011, 2, 89, 2, 1035, 870, 1151, 6, 2465, 3705, 123, 4, 864, 12, 332]",1799.0,20966703,Reproductive outcomes survivors childhood,6,0.05660377358490566
Inhibition of pituitary tumor-transforming gene-1 in thyroid cancer cells by drugs that decrease specificity proteins.,Molecular carcinogenesis,Mol. Carcinog.,2011-01-25,"Methyl 2-cyano-3,11-dioxo-18β-olean-1,12-dien-30-oate (CDODA-Me) and the corresponding 2-trifluoromethyl analog (CF(3)DODA-Me) are derived synthetically from the triterpenoid glycyrrhetinic acid, a major component of licorice. CDODA-Me and CF(3)DODA-Me inhibited growth of highly invasive ARO, DRO, K-18, and HTh-74 thyroid cancer cells and this was due, in part, to decreased expression of specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 that are overexpressed in these cells. CDODA-Me and CF(3)DODA-Me also decreased expression of Sp-dependent genes, such as survivin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and induced apoptosis. In addition, pituitary tumor-transforming gene-1 (PTTG-1) protein and mRNA levels were also decreased in thyroid cancer cells treated with CDODA-Me or CF(3)DODA-Me and this was accompanied by decreased expression of PTTG-1-dependent c-Myc and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) genes. RNA interference studies against Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 proteins showed that in thyroid cancer cells, PTTG-1 was an Sp-dependent gene. This study demonstrates for the first time that drugs, such as CDODA-Me and CF(3)DODA-Me, that decrease Sp protein expression also downregulate PTTG-1 in thyroid cancer cells and therefore have potential for clinical treatment of thyroid cancer and other endocrine neoplasias where PTTG-1 is a major pro-oncogenic factor.",Journal Article,3283.0,29.0,"Methyl 2-cyano-3,11-dioxo-18β-olean-1,12-dien-30-oate CDODA-Me corresponding 2-trifluoromethyl analog CF 3 DODA-Me derived synthetically triterpenoid glycyrrhetinic acid major component licorice CDODA-Me CF 3 DODA-Me inhibited growth highly invasive ARO DRO K-18 HTh-74 thyroid decreased expression specificity Sp transcription factors Sp1 Sp3 Sp4 overexpressed CDODA-Me CF 3 DODA-Me decreased expression Sp-dependent survivin vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF induced apoptosis addition pituitary tumor-transforming gene-1 PTTG-1 mRNA levels decreased thyroid treated CDODA-Me CF 3 DODA-Me accompanied decreased expression PTTG-1-dependent c-Myc fibroblast growth factor-2 FGF-2 RNA interference studies Sp1 Sp3 Sp4 showed thyroid PTTG-1 Sp-dependent demonstrates time drugs CDODA-Me CF 3 DODA-Me decrease Sp expression downregulate PTTG-1 thyroid potential clinical treatment thyroid endocrine neoplasias PTTG-1 major pro-oncogenic factor",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[5228, 18, 11777, 27, 175, 39533, 59758, 46425, 14, 133, 13030, 201, 33338, 17477, 4816, 2, 3, 1734, 18, 34019, 3497, 5729, 27, 27022, 4816, 32, 526, 24475, 29, 3, 15818, 59759, 971, 8, 458, 1249, 1, 59760, 17477, 4816, 2, 5729, 27, 27022, 4816, 879, 129, 1, 561, 416, 19613, 28365, 1634, 203, 2, 59761, 794, 12, 37, 2, 26, 10, 520, 4, 760, 6, 340, 55, 1, 1121, 178, 4074, 866, 130, 5557, 13919, 2, 19072, 17, 32, 1711, 4, 46, 37, 17477, 4816, 2, 5729, 27, 27022, 4816, 120, 340, 55, 1, 4074, 470, 214, 225, 22, 3160, 2, 756, 845, 129, 161, 618, 2, 277, 351, 4, 352, 30, 3621, 145, 14, 31737, 14, 178, 2, 956, 148, 11, 120, 340, 4, 12, 37, 73, 5, 17477, 4816, 15, 5729, 27, 27022, 4816, 2, 26, 10, 2756, 20, 340, 55, 1, 31737, 14, 470, 256, 1371, 2, 3758, 129, 161, 18, 6517, 18, 214, 893, 3182, 94, 480, 5557, 13919, 2, 19072, 652, 224, 17, 4, 12, 37, 31737, 14, 10, 35, 4074, 470, 145, 26, 45, 1902, 9, 3, 157, 98, 17, 600, 225, 22, 17477, 4816, 2, 5729, 27, 27022, 4816, 17, 775, 4074, 178, 55, 120, 10261, 31737, 14, 4, 12, 37, 2, 673, 47, 174, 9, 38, 24, 1, 12, 2, 127, 1293, 8235, 1257, 31737, 14, 16, 8, 458, 1805, 1302, 161]",1309.0,21268135,Inhibition pituitary tumor-transforming gene-1 thyroid drugs decrease specificity,105,0.9905660377358491

Retrospective review of 22 patients treated with SRS from 1994 until 2006. All patients were either intolerant or their tumors were unresponsive to dopamine agonist therapy. Nine patients (41%) had undergone prior transsphenoidal surgery. The median serum PRL concentration before SRS was 88.4 ng/mL (range, 25-943). The median treatment volume was 2.2 cm(3) (range, 0.4-29.0); the median margin radiation dose was 25 Gy (range, 16-30). The median endocrinologic follow-up was 60 months (range, 16-129). Tumor control after SRS was 100%. Serum PRL concentration was significantly lower (median, 28.4 ng/mL) (P = 0.006) at last follow-up, but the 4-year actuarial rate of biochemical remission off medications was only 17%.

Aggressive silent corticotroph adenoma progressing to pituitary carcinoma: the role of temozolomide therapy.,"Hormones (Athens, Greece)",Hormones (Athens),,"Temozolomide (TMZ) has recently been recommended as a novel approach in the management of aggressive pituitary tumors. Herein, we present the case of a 43-year-old man with a 20-year history of silent subtype 2 pituitary corticotroph adenoma. Nine surgical resections and radiotherapy had failed to provide a cure. Morphological evaluation of the tumor revealed a mildly pleomorphic adenoma, the cells of which showed low-level cell proliferative activity with Ki67, increased topoisomerase II alpha index and conclusive O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) immunoreactivity. Given its aggressive behavior and failure of conventional therapy, TMZ was administered. The treatment was continued even after MGMT immunopositivity was identified, but failed to decrease MGMT immunoexpression and exerted no morphologic effect. Examination of the lesion after TMZ therapy showed neither morphologic nor immunohistochemical alterations. In our case, TMZ administration, despite changing the TMZ dosing regimen to prompt a drug response, was incapable of depleting MGMT stores.",Case Reports,,,Temozolomide TMZ recently recommended novel approach management aggressive pituitary present case 43-year-old man 20-year history silent subtype 2 pituitary corticotroph adenoma surgical resections radiotherapy failed provide cure Morphological evaluation revealed mildly pleomorphic adenoma showed low-level proliferative activity Ki67 increased topoisomerase II alpha index conclusive O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase MGMT vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF immunoreactivity Given aggressive behavior failure conventional therapy TMZ administered treatment continued MGMT immunopositivity identified failed decrease MGMT immunoexpression exerted morphologic effect Examination lesion TMZ therapy showed morphologic immunohistochemical alterations case TMZ administration despite changing TMZ dosing regimen prompt drug response incapable depleting MGMT stores,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1537, 2081, 71, 761, 85, 793, 22, 8, 229, 353, 4, 3, 284, 1, 571, 57, 1986, 21, 364, 3, 473, 1, 8, 601, 111, 1095, 3628, 5, 8, 179, 111, 532, 1, 9890, 875, 18, 46651, 2434, 762, 221, 2185, 2, 310, 42, 1551, 6, 377, 8, 1722, 4268, 451, 1, 3, 30, 553, 8, 9443, 4581, 2434, 3, 37, 1, 92, 224, 154, 301, 31, 2441, 128, 5, 3654, 101, 3999, 215, 950, 558, 2, 11231, 1990, 49, 7015, 261, 3747, 2661, 22, 149, 22, 756, 845, 129, 161, 618, 4900, 447, 211, 571, 1710, 2, 496, 1, 809, 36, 2081, 10, 468, 3, 24, 10, 1351, 871, 50, 2661, 18964, 10, 108, 84, 1551, 6, 775, 2661, 21668, 2, 8753, 77, 2815, 254, 1385, 1, 3, 1180, 50, 2081, 36, 224, 2174, 2815, 2110, 1382, 593, 4, 114, 473, 2081, 634, 550, 3600, 3, 2081, 1280, 477, 6, 4776, 8, 234, 51, 10, 20290, 1, 9438, 2661, 21026]",1090.0,21724542,Aggressive silent corticotroph adenoma progressing pituitary carcinoma role temozolomide therapy,0,0.0
Nelfinavir induces radiation sensitization in pituitary adenoma cells.,Cancer biology & therapy,Cancer Biol. Ther.,2011-10-01,"Pituitary adenomas with local invasion and high secretory activity remain a therapeutic challenge. The HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir is a radiosensitizer in multiple tumor models. We tested nelfinavir as a radiosensitizer in pituitary adenoma cells in vitro and in vivo. We examined the effect of nelfinavir with radiation on in vitro cell viability, clonogenic survival, apoptosis, prolactin secretion, cell cycle distribution, and the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. We evaluated tumor growth delay and confirmed nelfinavir's effect on the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in a hind-flank model. Nelfinavir sensitized pituitary adenoma cells to ionizing radiation as shown by viability assays and clonogenic assay with an enhancement ratio of 1.2 (p < 0.05). There is increased apoptotic cell death, as determined by annexin-V expression and cleaved caspase-3 levels. Nelfinavir does not affect prolactin secretion or cell cycle distribution. In vivo, untreated tumors reached 4-fold volume in 12 days, 17 days with nelfinavir treatment, 27 days with radiation 6 Gy, and 41 days with nelfinavir plus radiation (one-way ANOVA p < 0.001).

"Endoscopic, endonasal resection of craniopharyngiomas:  analysis of outcome including extent of resection, cerebrospinal fluid leak, return to preoperative productivity, and body mass index.",Neurosurgery,Neurosurgery,2012-01-01,"The endoscopic, endonasal, extended transsphenoidal approach is a minimal-access technique for managing craniopharyngiomas. Outcome measures such as return to employment and body mass index (BMI) have not been reported and are necessary for comparison with open transcranial approaches. Most prior reports of the endoscopic, endonasal approach have reported unacceptably high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak rates. To assess the outcome of endoscopic, endonasal surgery in a consecutive series of craniopharyngiomas with special attention to extent of resection, CSF leak, return to employment, and BMI. Twenty-six surgeries were performed on 24 patients at Weill Cornell Medical College-New York Presbyterian Hospital. Five patients had recurrent lesions. Gross-total resection (GTR) was attempted in 21 surgeries. Indications for intended subtotal resection were advanced age, medical comorbidities, preservation of pituitary function, and hypothalamic invasion. Mean tumor diameter was 2.9 cm. GTR (18 surgeries) or near-total (>95%) resection (2 surgeries) was achieved in 95% when GTR was the goal. Seven patients received postoperative radiation therapy. Mean follow-up was 35 months with no recurrences in GTR cases and stable disease in all patients at last follow-up. Vision improved in 77%.

Phospho-histone H3 (pHH3) immuno-reactivity as a prognostic marker in non-functioning pituitary adenomas.,Pituitary,Pituitary,2012-12-01,"Nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFPA) are typically benign neoplasms that can cause significant morbidity through local mass effects. MIB-1/Ki-67 and p53 immuno-reactivity are used to predict aggressive behavior but have known limitations. No marker to date is widely used to reliably predict tumor progression. Phospho-histone H3 (pHH3) is a protein phosphorylated during chromatin condensation in mitosis, and thus anti-pHH3 immunocytochemistry is able to assess mitotic activity. Study objectives were to determine the relationship among pHH3, MIB-1/Ki-67, and p53 in NFPA, and to evaluate the relationship between these indices and time to progression (TTP). Seventy-six patients with NFPA operated on by a single neurosurgeon at University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from 1992 to 2006 were identified from a database and met all criteria for inclusion in this clinicopathology study. PHH3, MIB-1/Ki-67, and p53 immuno-reactivity was evaluated in each case. Retrospective review was used to determine TTP. With 282 person-years of follow-up, 19 progression events were observed. A correlation was found between MIB-1/Ki-67 and p53 immuno-reactivity (r = 0.25, p = 0.031). PHH3 did not correlate with either. When markers were dichotomized at the median, only MIB-1/Ki-67 correlated with TPP (log rank p = 0.018). Rank correlation analysis confirmed a significant inverse correlation between both MIB-1/Ki-67 (Dxy = -0.33, p = 0.036) and p53 (Dxy = -0.40, 0.016) immuno-reactivity and TTP. Our results support previous data suggesting that MIB-1/Ki-67 and p53 have clinical utility as prognostic markers for tumor progression. PHH3 did not prove to be associated with TTP in this retrospective study limited by few progression events.",Journal Article,2607.0,6.0,Nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas NFPA typically benign neoplasms cause significant morbidity local mass effects MIB-1/Ki-67 p53 immuno-reactivity predict aggressive behavior known limitations marker date widely reliably predict progression Phospho-histone H3 pHH3 phosphorylated chromatin condensation mitosis anti-pHH3 immunocytochemistry able assess mitotic activity objectives determine relationship pHH3 MIB-1/Ki-67 p53 NFPA evaluate relationship indices time progression TTP Seventy-six patients NFPA operated single neurosurgeon University Texas M.

Risk factors for obesity in adult survivors of childhood cancer: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2011-12-19,"Many Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) participants are at increased risk for obesity. The etiology of their obesity is likely multifactorial but not well understood. We evaluated the potential contribution of demographic, lifestyle, treatment, and intrapersonal factors and self-reported pharmaceutical use to obesity (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2) among 9,284 adult (> 18 years of age) CCSS participants. Independent predictors were identified using multivariable regression models. Interrelationships were determined using structural equation modeling (SEM). Independent risk factors for obesity included cancer diagnosed at 5 to 9 years of age (relative risk [RR], 1.12; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.24; P = .03), abnormal Short Form-36 physical function (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.33; P < .001), hypothalamic/pituitary radiation doses of 20 to 30 Gy (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.30; P = .01), and paroxetine use (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.54; P = .01). Meeting US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for vigorous physical activity (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.97; P = .01) and a medium amount of anxiety (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.99; P = .04) reduced the risk of obesity. Results of SEM (N = 8,244; comparative fit index = 0.999; Tucker Lewis index = 0.999; root mean square error of approximation = 0.014; weighted root mean square residual = 0.749) described the hierarchical impact of the direct predictors, moderators, and mediators of obesity.

Rapid-onset hypogonadism secondary to crizotinib use in men with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2012-04-04,"The objective of this study was to document the differences in testosterone (T) levels between crizotinib-treated and noncrizotinib-treated patients with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Testosterone levels were measured in 19 men with metastatic NSCLC who received crizotinib and in 19 men with metastatic NSCLC who did not receive crizotinib. Clinical characteristics of the patients were compared, and additional hormone assays were performed as appropriate. Two patients who began crizotinib and 4 patients who had dose interruptions or who stopped crizotinib therapy had serial hormone measurements, permitting the documentation of dynamic hormone changes on and off crizotinib treatment. Total T levels were low (<241 ng/dL) in 19 of 19 (100%) crizotinib-treated men and in 6 of 19 men (32%) with metastatic NSCLC who did not receive crizotinib (mean T levels, 131 ng/dL and 311 ng/dL, respectively; P = .0002). Only 1 in 5 patients who had anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements and had not yet received crizotinib had low T. The initiation of crizotinib in 2 patients who had previously normal T levels was associated with a rapid decreases in T and in luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone levels within 14 to 21 days.

Temozolomide in aggressive pituitary adenomas and carcinomas.,"Clinics (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",Clinics (Sao Paulo),2012-01-01,"Temozolomide is an alkylating agent used in the treatment of gliomas and, more recently, aggressive pituitary adenomas and carcinomas. Temozolomide methylates DNA and, thereby, has antitumor effects. O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, a DNA repair enzyme, removes the alkylating adducts that are induced by temozolomide, thereby counteracting its effects. A Medline search for all of the available publications regarding the use of temozolomide for the treatment of pituitary tumors was performed. To date, 46 cases of adenohypophysial tumors that were treated with temozolomide, including 30 adenomas and 16 carcinomas, have been reported. Eighteen of the 30 (60%) adenomas and 11 of the 16 (69%) carcinomas responded favorably to treatment. One patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and an aggressive prolactin-producing adenoma was also treated and demonstrated a good response. No significant complications have been attributed to temozolomide therapy. Thus, temozolomide is an effective treatment for the majority of aggressive adenomas and carcinomas. Evidence indicates that there is an inverse correlation between levels of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase immunoexpression and therapeutic response. Alternatively, high-level O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase immunoexpression correlates with an unfavorable response.

Diabetes insipidus following resection of pituitary tumors.,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,Clin Neurol Neurosurg,2012-08-24,"Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a common complication following pituitary surgery and can be transient or permanent. Neurogenic DI occurs following injury to the magnocellular neurons in the hypothalamus that produce and transport arginine vasopressin (AVP) and form the hypothalamo-hypophyseal tract. DI is defined by a constellation of signs and symptoms resulting in dilute high-volume urine output and increasing serum osmolality. The body's inability to concentrate urine leaves the patient dehydrated and leads to metabolic abnormalities that can be life threatening if not recognized and treated in a timely manner with an exogenous AVP analog. The reported incidence of postsurgical central DI varies from 1 to 67%. This wide range likely reflects inconsistencies in the working definition of DI across the literature. Factors affecting the rate of DI include pituitary tumor size, adherence to surrounding structures, surgical approach, and histopathology of pituitary lesion. The likelihood of postoperative DI can be reduced by careful preservation of the neurovascular structures of the hypothalamus, infundibulum, and neurohypophysis. Vigilance and meticulous surgical technique are essential to minimize injury to these critical regions that can lead to postsurgical DI.",Journal Article,2706.0,31.0,Diabetes insipidus DI common complication following pituitary surgery transient permanent Neurogenic DI occurs following injury magnocellular neurons hypothalamus produce transport arginine vasopressin AVP form hypothalamo-hypophyseal tract DI defined constellation signs symptoms resulting dilute high-volume urine output increasing serum osmolality body 's inability concentrate urine leaves patient dehydrated leads metabolic abnormalities life threatening recognized treated timely manner exogenous AVP analog reported incidence postsurgical central DI varies 1 67 wide range likely reflects inconsistencies working definition DI literature Factors affecting rate DI include pituitary size adherence surrounding structures surgical approach histopathology pituitary lesion likelihood postoperative DI reduced careful preservation neurovascular structures hypothalamus infundibulum neurohypophysis Vigilance meticulous surgical technique essential minimize injury critical regions lead postsurgical DI,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1978, 16366, 6641, 16, 8, 186, 1447, 366, 152, 2, 122, 40, 2473, 15, 4377, 16731, 6641, 1780, 366, 2730, 6, 3, 61804, 11930, 4, 3, 12717, 17, 2410, 2, 4294, 5392, 34043, 26483, 2, 1297, 3, 61805, 61806, 1696, 6641, 16, 395, 20, 8, 13862, 1, 3408, 2, 507, 1113, 4, 24498, 64, 433, 2646, 6911, 2, 602, 524, 38112, 3, 642, 292, 4985, 6, 15838, 2646, 15229, 3, 69, 43198, 2, 1940, 6, 1436, 1171, 17, 122, 40, 358, 3691, 492, 44, 1904, 2, 73, 4, 8, 4225, 1708, 5, 35, 4181, 26483, 3497, 3, 210, 287, 1, 6891, 854, 6641, 4037, 29, 14, 6, 598, 26, 1019, 184, 322, 5224, 14974, 4, 3, 2644, 2470, 1, 6641, 716, 3, 789, 130, 2319, 3, 116, 1, 6641, 643, 30, 444, 2149, 6, 2976, 2414, 221, 353, 2, 3831, 1, 1180, 3, 1420, 1, 573, 6641, 122, 40, 405, 20, 3465, 2224, 1, 3, 9848, 2414, 1, 3, 12717, 44870, 2, 47358, 13264, 2, 13764, 221, 1312, 32, 1452, 6, 3241, 2730, 6, 46, 740, 1374, 17, 122, 1122, 6, 6891, 6641]",1231.0,22921808,Diabetes insipidus following resection pituitary,0,0.0

Clinical ascertainment of health outcomes among adults treated for childhood cancer.,JAMA,JAMA,2013-06-01,"Adult survivors of childhood cancer are known to be at risk for treatment-related adverse health outcomes. A large population of survivors has not been evaluated using a comprehensive systematic clinical assessment to determine the prevalence of chronic health conditions. To determine the prevalence of adverse health outcomes and the proportion associated with treatment-related exposures in a large cohort of adult survivors of childhood cancer. Presence of health outcomes was ascertained using systematic exposure-based medical assessments among 1713 adult (median age, 32 [range, 18-60] years) survivors of childhood cancer (median time from diagnosis, 25 [range, 10-47] years) enrolled in the St Jude Lifetime Cohort Study since October 1, 2007, and undergoing follow-up through October 31, 2012. Age-specific cumulative prevalence of adverse outcomes by organ system. Using clinical criteria, the crude prevalence of adverse health outcomes was highest for pulmonary (abnormal pulmonary function, 65.2% [95% CI, 60.4%-69.8%]), auditory (hearing loss, 62.1% [95% CI, 55.8%-68.2%]), endocrine or reproductive (any endocrine condition, such as hypothalamic-pituitary axis disorders and male germ cell dysfunction, 62.0% [95% CI, 59.5%-64.6%]), cardiac (any cardiac condition, such as heart valve disorders, 56.4% [95% CI, 53.5%-59.2%]), and neurocognitive (neurocognitive impairment, 48.0% [95% CI, 44.9%-51.0%]) function, whereas abnormalities involving hepatic (liver dysfunction, 13.0% [95% CI, 10.8%-15.3%]), skeletal (osteoporosis, 9.6% [95% CI, 8.0%-11.5%]), renal (kidney dysfunction, 5.0% [95% CI, 4.0%-6.3%]), and hematopoietic (abnormal blood cell counts, 3.0% [95% CI, 2.1%-3.9%]) function were less common. Among survivors at risk for adverse outcomes following specific cancer treatment modalities, the estimated cumulative prevalence at age 50 years was 21.6% (95% CI, 19.3%-23.9%) for cardiomyopathy, 83.5% (95% CI, 80.2%-86.8%) for heart valve disorder, 81.3% (95% CI, 77.6%-85.0%) for pulmonary dysfunction, 76.8% (95% CI, 73.6%-80.0%) for pituitary dysfunction, 86.5% (95% CI, 82.3%-90.7%) for hearing loss, 31.9% (95% CI, 28.0%-35.8%) for primary ovarian failure, 31.1% (95% CI, 27.3%-34.9%) for Leydig cell failure, and 40.9% (95% CI, 32.0%-49.8%) for breast cancer.

"Technique, outcomes, and acute toxicities in adults treated with proton beam craniospinal irradiation.",Neuro-oncology,Neuro-oncology,2013-12-04,"Proton craniospinal irradiation (p-CSI) has been proposed to reduce side effects associated with CSI. We evaluated acute toxicities and preliminary clinical outcomes in a series of adults treated with p-CSI. We reviewed medical records for 50 patients (aged 16-63 y) with malignancies of varying histologies treated consecutively with vertebral body-sparing p-CSI at MD Anderson Cancer Center from 2007 to 2011. Median CSI and total boost doses were 30.6 and 54 Gy. Forty patients received chemotherapy, varying by histology. Median follow-up was 20.1 months (range, 0.3-59). Median doses to the thyroid gland, pituitary gland, hypothalamus, and cochleae were 0.003 Gy-relative biological effectiveness (RBE; range, 0.001-8.5), 36.1 Gy-RBE (22.5-53.0), 37.1 Gy-RBE (22.3-54.4), and 33.9 Gy-RBE (22.2-52.4), respectively. Median percent weight loss during CSI was 1.6% (range, 10% weight loss to 14% weight gain). Mild nausea/vomiting was common (grade 1 = 46%, grade 2 = 20%); however, only 5 patients experienced grade ≥2 anorexia (weight loss >5% baseline weight). Median percent baseline white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets at nadir were 52% (range, 13%-100%), 97% (65%-112%), and 61% (10%-270%), respectively. Four patients developed grade ≥3 cytopenias. Overall and progression-free survival rates were 96% and 82%, respectively, at 2 years and 84% and 68% at 5 years. This large series of patients treated with p-CSI confirms low rates of acute toxicity, consistent with dosimetric models.

Exome sequencing identifies BRAF mutations in papillary craniopharyngiomas.,Nature genetics,Nat. Genet.,2014-01-12,"Craniopharyngiomas are epithelial tumors that typically arise in the suprasellar region of the brain. Patients experience substantial clinical sequelae from both extension of the tumors and therapeutic interventions that damage the optic chiasm, the pituitary stalk and the hypothalamic area. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified mutations in CTNNB1 (β-catenin) in nearly all adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas examined (11/12, 92%) and recurrent mutations in BRAF (resulting in p.Val600Glu) in all papillary craniopharyngiomas (3/3, 100%). Targeted genotyping revealed BRAF p.Val600Glu in 95% of papillary craniopharyngiomas (36 of 39 tumors) and mutation of CTNNB1 in 96% of adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas (51 of 53 tumors). The CTNNB1 and BRAF mutations were clonal in each tumor subtype, and we detected no other recurrent mutations or genomic aberrations in either subtype. Adamantinomatous and papillary craniopharyngiomas harbor mutations that are mutually exclusive and clonal. These findings have important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of these neoplasms.

Combined high-field intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging and endoscopy increase extent of resection and progression-free survival for pituitary adenomas.,Pituitary,Pituitary,2015-02-01,"The clinical benefit of combined intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) and endoscopy for transsphenoidal pituitary adenoma resection has not been completely characterized. This study assessed the impact of microscopy, endoscopy, and/or iMRI on progression-free survival, extent of resection status (gross-, near-, and sub-total resection), and operative complications. Retrospective analyses were performed on 446 transsphenoidal pituitary adenoma surgeries at a single institution between 1998 and 2012. Multivariate analyses were used to control for baseline characteristics, differences during extent of resection status, and progression-free survival analysis. Additional surgery was performed after iMRI in 56/156 cases (35.9%), which led to increased extent of resection status in 15/156 cases (9.6%). Multivariate ordinal logistic regression revealed no increase in extent of resection status following iMRI or endoscopy alone; however, combining these modalities increased extent of resection status (odds ratio 2.05, 95% CI 1.21-3.46) compared to conventional transsphenoidal microsurgery. Multivariate Cox regression revealed that reduced extent of resection status shortened progression-free survival for near- versus gross-total resection [hazard ratio (HR) 2.87, 95% CI 1.24-6.65] and sub- versus near-total resection (HR 2.10; 95% CI 1.00-4.40).

Pituitary expression of CTLA-4 mediates hypophysitis secondary to administration of CTLA-4 blocking antibody.,Science translational medicine,Sci Transl Med,2014-04-01,"Hypophysitis is a chronic inflammation of the pituitary gland of unknown (primary forms) or recognizable (secondary forms) etiology, such as the use of ipilimumab in cancer immunotherapy. Ipilimumab, which blocks the T cell inhibitory molecule CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4), induces hypophysitis in about 4% of patients through unknown mechanisms. We first established a model of secondary hypophysitis by repeated injections of a CTLA-4 blocking antibody into SJL/J or C57BL/6J mice, and showed that they developed lymphocytic infiltration of the pituitary gland and circulating pituitary antibodies. We next assessed the prevalence of pituitary antibodies in a cohort of 20 patients with advanced melanoma or prostate cancer, 7 with a clinical diagnosis of hypophysitis, before and after ipilimumab administration. Pituitary antibodies, negative at baseline, developed in the 7 patients with hypophysitis but not in the 13 without it; these antibodies predominantly recognized thyrotropin-, follicle-stimulating hormone-, and corticotropin-secreting cells. We then hypothesized that the injected CTLA-4 antibody could cause pituitary toxicity if bound to CTLA-4 antigen expressed ""ectopically"" on pituitary endocrine cells. Pituitary glands indeed expressed CTLA-4 at both RNA and protein levels, particularly in a subset of prolactin- and thyrotropin-secreting cells. Notably, these cells became the site of complement activation, featuring deposition of C3d and C4d components and an inflammatory cascade akin to that seen in type II hypersensitivity. In summary, the study offers a mechanism to explain the pituitary toxicity observed in patients receiving ipilimumab, and highlights the utility of measuring pituitary antibodies in this form of secondary hypophysitis.

"Descriptive epidemiology of pituitary tumors in the United States, 2004-2009.",Journal of neurosurgery,J. Neurosurg.,2014-06-13,"Pituitary tumors are abnormal growths that develop in the pituitary gland. The Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS) contains the largest aggregation of population-based data on the incidence of primary CNS tumors in the US. These data were used to determine the incidence of tumors of the pituitary and associated trends between 2004 and 2009. Using incidence data from 49 population-based state cancer registries, 2004-2009, age-adjusted incidence rates per 100,000 population for pituitary tumors with ICD-O-3 (International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition) histology codes 8040, 8140, 8146, 8246, 8260, 8270, 8271, 8272, 8280, 8281, 8290, 8300, 8310, 8323, 9492 (site C75.1 only), and 9582 were calculated overall and by patient sex, race, Hispanic ethnicity, and age at diagnosis. Corresponding annual percent change (APC) scores and 95% confidence intervals were also calculated using Joinpoint to characterize trends in incidence rates over time. Diagnostic confirmation by subregion of the US was also examined. The overall annual incidence rate increased from 2.52 (95% CI 2.46-2.58) in 2004 to 3.13 (95% CI 3.07-3.20) in 2009. Associated time trend yielded an APC of 4.25% (95% CI 2.91%-5.61%). When stratifying by patient sex, the annual incidence rate increased from 2.42 (95% CI 2.33-2.50) to 2.94 (95% CI 2.85-3.03) in men and 2.70 (95% CI 2.62-2.79) to 3.40 (95% CI 3.31-3.49) in women, with APCs of 4.35% (95% CI 3.21%-5.51%) and 4.34% (95% CI 2.23%-6.49%), respectively. When stratifying by race, the annual incidence rate increased from 2.31 (95% CI 2.25-2.37) to 2.81 (95% CI 2.74-2.88) in whites, 3.99 (95% CI 3.77-4.23) to 5.31 (95% CI 5.06-5.56) in blacks, 1.77 (95% CI 1.26-2.42) to 2.52 (95% CI 1.96-3.19) in American Indians or Alaska Natives, and 1.86 (95% CI 1.62-2.13) to 2.03 (95% CI 1.80-2.28) in Asians or Pacific Islanders, with APCs of 3.91% (95% CI 2.88%-4.95%), 5.25% (95% CI 3.19%-7.36%), 5.31% (95% CI -0.11% to 11.03%), and 2.40% (95% CI -3.20% to 8.31%), respectively. When stratifying by Hispanic ethnicity, the annual incidence rate increased from 2.46 (95% CI 2.40-2.52) to 3.03 (95% CI 2.97-3.10) in non-Hispanics and 3.12 (95% CI 2.91-3.34) to 4.01 (95% CI 3.80-4.24) in Hispanics, with APCs of 4.15% (95% CI 2.67%-5.65%) and 5.01% (95% CI 4.42%-5.60%), respectively. When stratifying by age at diagnosis, the incidence of pituitary tumor was highest for those 65-74 years old and lowest for those 15-24 years old, with corresponding overall age-adjusted incidence rates of 6.39 (95% CI 6.24-6.54) and 1.56 (95% CI 1.51-1.61), respectively. In this large patient cohort, the incidence of pituitary tumors reported between 2004 and 2009 was found to increase. Possible explanations for this increase include changes in documentation, changes in the diagnosis and registration of these tumors, improved diagnostics, improved data collection, increased awareness of pituitary diseases among physicians and the public, longer life expectancies, and/or an actual increase in the incidence of these tumors in the US population.",Journal

Parent-of-origin-specific allelic associations among 106 genomic loci for age at menarche.,Nature,Nature,2014-07-23,"Age at menarche is a marker of timing of puberty in females. It varies widely between individuals, is a heritable trait and is associated with risks for obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer and all-cause mortality. Studies of rare human disorders of puberty and animal models point to a complex hypothalamic-pituitary-hormonal regulation, but the mechanisms that determine pubertal timing and underlie its links to disease risk remain unclear. Here, using genome-wide and custom-genotyping arrays in up to 182,416 women of European descent from 57 studies, we found robust evidence (P < 5 × 10(-8)) for 123 signals at 106 genomic loci associated with age at menarche. Many loci were associated with other pubertal traits in both sexes, and there was substantial overlap with genes implicated in body mass index and various diseases, including rare disorders of puberty. Menarche signals were enriched in imprinted regions, with three loci (DLK1-WDR25, MKRN3-MAGEL2 and KCNK9) demonstrating parent-of-origin-specific associations concordant with known parental expression patterns. Pathway analyses implicated nuclear hormone receptors, particularly retinoic acid and γ-aminobutyric acid-B2 receptor signalling, among novel mechanisms that regulate pubertal timing in humans. Our findings suggest a genetic architecture involving at least hundreds of common variants in the coordinated timing of the pubertal transition.

Retrospective study in an established cohort of CCS with 748 participants treated with CRT (394 men; mean age, 34.2 years [range, 19.4 to 59.6 years] observed for a mean of 27.3 years [range, 10.8 to 47.7 years]). Multivariable logistic regression was used to study associations between demographic and treatment-related risk factors and pituitary deficiencies, as well as associations between untreated deficiencies and cardiovascular health, bone mineral density (BMD), and physical fitness. The estimated point prevalence was 46.5% for GHD, 10.8% for LH/FSHD, 7.5% for TSHD, and 4% for ACTHD, and the cumulative incidence increased with follow-up. GHD and LH/FSHD were not treated in 99.7% and 78.5% of affected individuals, respectively. Male sex and obesity were significantly associated with LH/FSHD; white race was significant associated with LH/FSHD and TSHD. Compared with CRT doses less than 22 Gy, doses of 22 to 29.9 Gy were significantly associated with GHD; doses ≥ 22 Gy were associated with LH/FSHD; and doses ≥ 30 Gy were associated with TSHD and ACTHD. Untreated GHD was significantly associated with decreased muscle mass and exercise tolerance; untreated LH/FSHD was associated with hypertension, dyslipidemia, low BMD, and slow walking; and both deficits, independently, were associated with with abdominal obesity, low energy expenditure, and muscle weakness.

Pituitary adenoma with paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma (3PAs) and succinate dehydrogenase defects in humans and mice.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,2015-02-19,"Germline mutations in genes coding succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) subunits A, B, C, and D have been identified in familial paragangliomas (PGLs)/pheochromocytomas (PHEOs) and other tumors. We described a GH-secreting pituitary adenoma (PA) caused by SDHD mutation in a patient with familial PGLs. Additional patients with PAs and SDHx defects have since been reported. We studied 168 patients with unselected sporadic PA and with the association of PAs, PGLs, and/or pheochromocytomas, a condition we named the 3P association (3PAs) for SDHx germline mutations. We also studied the pituitary gland and hormonal profile of Sdhb(+/-) mice and their wild-type littermates at different ages. No SDHx mutations were detected among sporadic PA, whereas three of four familial cases were positive for a mutation (75%). Most of the SDHx-deficient PAs were either prolactinomas or somatotropinomas. Pituitaries of Sdhb(+/-) mice older than 12 months had an increased number mainly of prolactin-secreting cells and several ultrastructural abnormalities such as intranuclear inclusions, altered chromatin nuclear pattern, and abnormal mitochondria. Igf-1 levels of mutant mice tended to be higher across age groups, whereas Prl and Gh levels varied according to age and sex. The present study confirms the existence of a new association that we termed 3PAs. It is due mostly to germline SDHx defects, although sporadic cases of 3PAs without SDHx defects also exist.

Incidence of primary cancers and intracranial tumour recurrences in GH-treated and untreated adult hypopituitary patients: analyses from the Hypopituitary Control and Complications Study.,European journal of endocrinology,Eur. J. Endocrinol.,2015-03-25,"Speculation remains that GH treatment is associated with increased neoplasia risk. Studies in GH-treated childhood cancer survivors suggested higher rates of second neoplasms, while cancer risk data for GH-treated and untreated hypopituitary adults have been variable. We present primary cancer risk data from the Hypopituitary Control and Complications Study (HypoCCS) with a focus on specific cancers, and assessment of recurrence rates for pituitary adenomas (PA) and craniopharyngiomas (CP). Incident neoplasms during HypoCCS were evaluated in 8418 GH-treated vs 1268 untreated patients for primary malignancies, 3668 GH-treated vs 720 untreated patients with PA history, and 956 GH-treated vs 102 untreated patients with CP history. Using population cancer rates, standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for all primary cancers, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers. Neoplasm rates in GH-treated vs untreated patients were analysed after propensity score adjustment of baseline treatment group imbalances. During mean follow-up of 4.8 years, 225 primary cancers were identified in GH-treated patients, with SIR of 0.82 (95% CI 0.71-0.93). SIRs (95% CI) for GH-treated patients were 0.59 (0.36-0.90) for breast, 0.80 (0.57-1.10) for prostate, and 0.62 (0.38-0.96) for colorectal cancers. Cancer risk was not statistically different between GH-treated and untreated patients (relative risk (RR)=1.00 (95% CI 0.70-1.41), P=0.98).

Long-term quality of life after endonasal endoscopic resection of adult craniopharyngiomas.,Journal of neurosurgery,J. Neurosurg.,2015-04-17,"Craniopharyngiomas are benign parasellar tumors for which surgical removal, although potentially curative, often leads to morbidity with resulting decreases in quality of life (QOL). The endonasal endoscopic approach is a minimal-access technique for removing these tumors and may reduce postoperative morbidity. The QOL following this method for resection of craniopharyngiomas has not been documented. The authors reviewed a database of consecutive endonasal endoscopic surgeries done at Weill Cornell Medical College. Adult patients with histologically proven craniopharyngiomas were included who had completed either only postoperative (> 9 months) or both pre- and postoperative QOL forms, the Anterior Skull Base Quality of Life (ASBQ) questionnaire, and the 22-Item Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22). Rates of gross-total resection (GTR), complications, and visual and endocrine function were collected. Retrospective independence (Wen score) was also assigned. A contemporaneous group of patients undergoing endonasal endoscopic pituitary macroadenoma resection was used as a control. This study included 33 procedures performed in 31 patients. The average postoperative ASBQ score was 3.35 and the SNOT-22 score was 19.6. Better QOL was associated with GTR and postoperative radiation. Worse QOL was associated with persistent visual defects, hypopituitarism, tumor recurrence, increase in body mass index, and worsening Wen score. In a subset of 10 patients, both pre- and postoperative (> 9 months) QOL scores were obtained. Both ASBQ and SNOT-22 scores showed stability and a trend toward improvement, from 2.93 ± 0.51 to 2.96 ± 0.47 (ASBQ) and 23.7 ± 10.8 to 18.4 ± 11.6 (SNOT-22). Compared with 62 patients undergoing endoscopic pituitary macroadenoma resection, patients with craniopharyngiomas had worse postoperative QOL on the ASBQ (3.35 vs 3.80; p = 0.023) and SNOT-22 (19.6 vs 13.4; p = 0.12). This report of validated site-specific QOL following endoscopic surgery for craniopharyngiomas shows an overall maintenance of postoperative compared with preoperative QOL. Better QOL could be seen in patients with GTR and radiation therapy, and worse QOL was found in patients with visual or endocrine deficits. Nevertheless, patients with craniopharyngiomas still had worse QOL than those undergoing similar surgery for pituitary macroadenomas, confirming the worse prognosis of craniopharyngiomas even when removed via a minimally invasive approach. These measures should serve as benchmarks for comparison with open transcranial approaches to similar tumors.",Journal Article,1740.0,26.0,Craniopharyngiomas benign parasellar surgical removal potentially curative leads morbidity resulting decreases quality life QOL endonasal endoscopic approach minimal-access technique removing reduce postoperative morbidity QOL following resection craniopharyngiomas documented authors reviewed database consecutive endonasal endoscopic surgeries Weill Cornell Medical College Adult patients histologically proven craniopharyngiomas included completed postoperative 9 months pre- postoperative QOL forms Anterior Skull Base Quality Life ASBQ questionnaire 22-Item Sinonasal Outcome Test SNOT-22 Rates gross-total resection GTR complications visual endocrine function collected Retrospective independence Wen score assigned contemporaneous group patients undergoing endonasal endoscopic pituitary macroadenoma resection control included 33 procedures performed 31 patients average postoperative ASBQ score 3.35 SNOT-22 score 19.6 Better QOL associated GTR postoperative radiation Worse QOL associated persistent visual defects hypopituitarism recurrence increase body mass index worsening Wen score subset 10 patients pre- postoperative 9 months QOL scores obtained ASBQ SNOT-22 scores showed stability trend improvement 2.93 ± 0.51 2.96 ± 0.47 ASBQ 23.7 ± 10.8 18.4 ± 11.6 SNOT-22 Compared 62 patients undergoing endoscopic pituitary macroadenoma resection patients craniopharyngiomas worse postoperative QOL ASBQ 3.35 vs 3.80 p 0.023 SNOT-22 19.6 vs 13.4 p 0.12 report validated site-specific QOL following endoscopic surgery craniopharyngiomas shows overall maintenance postoperative compared preoperative QOL Better QOL seen patients GTR radiation therapy worse QOL patients visual endocrine deficits patients craniopharyngiomas worse QOL undergoing similar surgery pituitary macroadenomas confirming worse prognosis craniopharyngiomas removed minimally invasive approach measures serve benchmarks comparison open transcranial approaches similar,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[10708, 32, 1002, 18260, 57, 9, 92, 221, 2829, 242, 751, 1075, 629, 1940, 6, 787, 5, 1113, 2140, 4, 372, 1, 358, 1001, 3, 18636, 2056, 353, 16, 8, 1048, 1655, 1312, 9, 9026, 46, 57, 2, 68, 969, 573, 787, 3, 1001, 366, 26, 596, 9, 170, 1, 10708, 71, 44, 85, 1405, 3, 738, 446, 8, 609, 1, 935, 18636, 2056, 5305, 1822, 28, 20587, 19143, 484, 2979, 780, 7, 5, 2161, 1930, 10708, 11, 159, 54, 42, 781, 361, 158, 573, 83, 53, 15, 110, 671, 2, 573, 1001, 2377, 3, 2882, 5054, 1782, 372, 1, 358, 32423, 1770, 2, 3, 350, 3471, 7605, 228, 412, 32424, 350, 151, 1, 1789, 181, 170, 4833, 521, 2, 3046, 2, 1293, 343, 11, 786, 459, 5773, 48986, 368, 10, 120, 896, 8, 11633, 87, 1, 7, 479, 18636, 2056, 27905, 170, 10, 95, 22, 8, 182, 26, 45, 159, 466, 1369, 173, 4, 456, 7, 3, 1011, 573, 32423, 368, 10, 27, 465, 2, 3, 32424, 350, 368, 10, 326, 49, 380, 1001, 10, 41, 5, 4833, 2, 573, 121, 639, 1001, 10, 41, 5, 1882, 3046, 2945, 19832, 30, 146, 344, 4, 642, 782, 558, 2, 4323, 48986, 368, 4, 8, 697, 1, 79, 7, 110, 671, 2, 573, 83, 53, 1001, 703, 11, 683, 110, 32423, 2, 32424, 350, 703, 224, 2769, 2, 8, 853, 1317, 767, 29, 18, 966, 810, 13, 725, 6, 18, 921, 810, 13, 662, 32423, 2, 382, 67, 810, 79, 66, 6, 203, 39, 810, 175, 49, 32424, 350, 72, 5, 744, 7, 479, 2056, 27905, 170, 7, 5, 10708, 42, 639, 573, 1001, 23, 3, 32423, 27, 465, 105, 27, 493, 19, 13, 4482, 2, 32424, 350, 326, 49, 105, 233, 39, 19, 13, 133, 26, 414, 1, 938, 606, 112, 1001, 366, 2056, 152, 9, 10708, 1949, 35, 63, 1146, 1, 573, 72, 5, 498, 1001, 380, 1001, 359, 40, 527, 4, 7, 5, 4833, 2, 121, 36, 2, 639, 1001, 10, 204, 4, 7, 5, 3046, 15, 1293, 2752, 3873, 7, 5, 10708, 1234, 42, 639, 1001, 76, 135, 479, 288, 152, 9, 37188, 5030, 3, 639, 356, 1, 10708, 871, 198, 2264, 847, 8, 2144, 416, 353, 46, 1018, 257, 1833, 22, 9945, 9, 1155, 5, 1020, 33172, 611, 6, 288, 57]",2478.0,25884258,Long-term quality life endonasal endoscopic resection adult craniopharyngiomas,1,0.009433962264150943
Identification of targets for rational pharmacological therapy in childhood craniopharyngioma.,Acta neuropathologica communications,Acta Neuropathol Commun,2015-05-21,"Pediatric adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma (ACP) is a histologically benign but clinically aggressive brain tumor that arises from the sellar/suprasellar region. Despite a high survival rate with current surgical and radiation therapy (75-95 % at 10 years), ACP is associated with debilitating visual, endocrine, neurocognitive and psychological morbidity, resulting in excheptionally poor quality of life for survivors. Identification of an effective pharmacological therapy could drastically decrease morbidity and improve long term outcomes for children with ACP. Using mRNA microarray gene expression analysis of 15 ACP patient samples, we have found several pharmaceutical targets that are significantly and consistently overexpressed in our panel of ACP relative to other pediatric brain tumors, pituitary tumors, normal pituitary and normal brain tissue. Among the most highly expressed are several targets of the kinase inhibitor dasatinib - LCK, EPHA2 and SRC; EGFR pathway targets - AREG, EGFR and ERBB3; and other potentially actionable cancer targets - SHH, MMP9 and MMP12. We confirm by western blot that a subset of these targets is highly expressed in ACP primary tumor samples. We report here the first published transcriptome for ACP and the identification of targets for rational therapy. Experimental drugs targeting each of these gene products are currently being tested clinically and pre-clinically for the treatment of other tumor types. This study provides a rationale for further pre-clinical and clinical studies of novel pharmacological treatments for ACP. Development of mouse and cell culture models for ACP will further enable the translation of these targets from the lab to the clinic, potentially ushering in a new era in the treatment of ACP.",Journal Article,1706.0,42.0,Pediatric adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma ACP histologically benign clinically aggressive brain arises sellar/suprasellar region Despite high survival rate current surgical radiation therapy 75-95 10 years ACP associated debilitating visual endocrine neurocognitive psychological morbidity resulting excheptionally poor quality life survivors Identification effective pharmacological therapy drastically decrease morbidity improve long term outcomes children ACP mRNA microarray expression 15 ACP patient pharmaceutical targets significantly consistently overexpressed panel ACP relative pediatric brain pituitary normal pituitary normal brain tissue highly expressed targets kinase inhibitor dasatinib LCK EPHA2 SRC EGFR pathway targets AREG EGFR ERBB3 potentially actionable targets SHH MMP9 MMP12 confirm western blot subset targets highly expressed ACP primary report published transcriptome ACP identification targets rational therapy Experimental drugs targeting products currently tested clinically pre-clinically treatment types provides rationale pre-clinical clinical studies novel pharmacological treatments ACP Development mouse culture models ACP enable translation targets lab clinic potentially ushering new era treatment ACP,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[815, 22825, 7205, 6953, 16, 8, 2161, 1002, 84, 505, 571, 342, 30, 17, 6053, 29, 3, 14479, 13122, 1053, 550, 8, 64, 25, 116, 5, 291, 221, 2, 121, 36, 481, 48, 28, 79, 60, 6953, 16, 41, 5, 8099, 3046, 1293, 2958, 2, 2624, 787, 1113, 4, 66139, 334, 372, 1, 358, 9, 332, 911, 1, 35, 323, 3419, 36, 359, 11900, 775, 787, 2, 401, 319, 337, 123, 9, 541, 5, 6953, 75, 956, 1727, 145, 55, 65, 1, 167, 6953, 69, 347, 21, 47, 204, 392, 6278, 637, 17, 32, 97, 2, 2433, 1711, 4, 114, 993, 1, 6953, 580, 6, 127, 815, 342, 57, 57, 295, 2, 295, 342, 246, 107, 3, 96, 561, 570, 32, 392, 637, 1, 3, 216, 230, 1674, 15355, 5511, 2, 2023, 227, 308, 637, 14301, 227, 2, 6573, 2, 127, 751, 2856, 12, 637, 5170, 10356, 2, 41095, 21, 1843, 20, 1521, 2639, 17, 8, 697, 1, 46, 637, 16, 561, 570, 4, 6953, 86, 30, 347, 21, 414, 467, 3, 157, 983, 3917, 9, 6953, 2, 3, 911, 1, 637, 9, 2696, 36, 1560, 600, 529, 296, 1, 46, 145, 2766, 32, 694, 486, 650, 505, 2, 671, 505, 9, 3, 24, 1, 127, 30, 630, 26, 45, 777, 8, 1728, 9, 195, 671, 38, 2, 38, 94, 1, 229, 3419, 640, 9, 6953, 193, 1, 830, 2, 31, 2099, 274, 9, 6953, 303, 195, 3047, 3, 2691, 1, 46, 637, 29, 3, 14118, 6, 3, 1188, 751, 28591, 4, 8, 217, 1713, 4, 3, 24, 1, 6953]",1723.0,25990246,Identification targets rational pharmacological therapy childhood craniopharyngioma,6,0.05660377358490566
Central precocious puberty following the diagnosis and treatment of paediatric cancer and central nervous system tumours: presentation and long-term outcomes.,Clinical endocrinology,Clin. Endocrinol. (Oxf),2015-11-16,"To estimate the prevalence of central precocious puberty (CPP) after treatment for tumours and malignancies involving the central nervous system (CNS) and examine repercussions on growth and pubertal outcomes. Retrospective study of patients with tumours near and/or exposed to radiotherapy to the hypothalamus/pituitary axis (HPA). Patients with CPP were evaluated at puberty onset, completion of GnRH agonist treatment (GnRHa) and last follow-up. Multivariable analysis was used to test associations between tumour location, sex, age at CPP, GnRHa duration and a diagnosis of CPP with final height <-2SD score (SDS), gonadotropin deficiency (LH/FSHD) and obesity, respectively. Eighty patients (47 females) had CPP and were followed for 11·4 ± 5·0 years (mean ± SD). The prevalence of CPP was 15·2% overall, 29·2% following HPA tumours and 6·6% after radiotherapy for non-HPA tumours. Height <-2SDS was more common at the last follow-up than at the puberty onset (21·4% vs 2·4%, P = 0·005). Obesity was more prevalent at the last follow-up than at the completion of GnRHa or the puberty onset (37·7%, 22·6% and 20·8%, respectively, P = 0·03). Longer duration of GnRHa was associated with increased odds of final height <-2SDS (OR = 2·1, 95% CI 1·0-4·3) and longer follow-up with obesity (OR = 1·3, 95% CI 1·1-1·6).

Association between Hyperprolactinemia and Granulomatous Mastitis.,The breast journal,Breast J,2015-12-26,"Granulomatous mastitis (GM) is a relatively uncommon inflammatory breast lesion with multiple suggested etiologies. Although most GM cases show association with lactation and pregnancy, a minority of cases have been linked to hyperprolactinemia caused by either dopamine antagonist medications or with intracranial lesions, such as pituitary adenoma. The goal of this study is to review the GM cases reported in the literature with a specific emphasis on those cases associated with hyperprolactinemia and prolactinomas and to identify cases of GM seen at the Cleveland Clinic Florida which demonstrate co-occurrences of GM and intracranial lesions. CoPath and Epic data bases at Cleveland Clinic Florida were searched for cases describing inflammatory breast lesions in patients with pituitary pathology. Chart reviews were conducted and pertinent medical history was extracted for case reports. H&E-stained paraffin-embedded sections retrieved from Cleveland Clinic Florida pathology storage were evaluated by light microscopy. Four cases showing a co-occurrence of GM and hyperprolactinemia were consequently identified. A prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma was present in two of the three GM cases. The third case demonstrated a concomitant craniopharyngioma, which was also associated with a rise in serum prolactin. This phenomenon was presumably attributable to compression, resulting in compromised transport of dopamine to the adenohypophysis and subsequent disinhibition of prolactin secretion by lactotrophs. The fourth patient with GM had a similar history of elevated prolactin. Classical histopathological features of GM were found in all four cases, including noncaseating granulomas, multinucleated giant cells, epithelioid histiocytes, and chronic inflammation. Intriguingly, complete resolution of inflammatory breast lesions along with normalization of prolactin levels occurred following the surgical excision of the craniopharyngioma, suggesting that intracranial lesion-induced hyperprolactinemia might be directly causal in GM. Therefore, the authors would suggest screening for pituitary tumors and evaluate prolactin levels in the workup of GM patients without a recent history of lactation and pregnancy and no other identified etiology.

Radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide for the management of extraneural metastases in pituitary carcinoma.,Pituitary,Pituitary,2016-08-01,"Pituitary carcinomas (PC) are uncommon neuroendocrine tumors, accounting for 0.1 % of all pituitary tumors. The diagnosis of PC is based on the presence of metastases from a pituitary adenoma, and not by local invasion or pathological features alone. PC is typically resistant to therapy, with a median overall survival of only 31 months. There is no standard treatment for PC, but maximal safe resection and radiation are performed when possible. Encouraging preliminary data on the use of temozolomide (TMZ)-based therapy has been previously reported. We report the response to therapy and safety of radiation with concurrent temozolomide (RT/TMZ) in 2 adult patients with heavily pretreated PC and extraneural metastases. Both patients had prior history of pituitary macroadenoma. At the time of diagnosis of PC, Ki-67 % was 24.2 and 10 %, with positive p53 staining in one case. Metastatic sites included lymph nodes, liver and bone. Case-1 received RT/TMZ to the tumor bed in the skull base and to the metastases in the cervical lymph nodes. Case-2 received RT/TMZ to recurrent tumor involving portacaval lymph nodes. Both patients achieved excellent long-term control of the sites of treated extraneural metastases, with no significant acute or delayed toxicity. RT/TMZ was safely delivered and might provide sustained control of extraneural metastases in PC. Although this retrospective report has limitations, RT/TMZ can be considered as a therapeutic option for the management of extraneural metastases in PC.",Case Reports,1268.0,8.0,Pituitary carcinomas PC uncommon neuroendocrine accounting 0.1 pituitary diagnosis PC based presence metastases pituitary adenoma local invasion pathological features PC typically resistant therapy median overall survival 31 months standard treatment PC maximal safe resection radiation performed possible Encouraging preliminary use temozolomide TMZ -based therapy previously reported report response therapy safety radiation concurrent temozolomide RT/TMZ 2 adult patients heavily pretreated PC extraneural metastases patients prior history pituitary macroadenoma time diagnosis PC Ki-67 24.2 10 positive p53 staining case Metastatic sites included lymph nodes liver bone Case-1 received RT/TMZ bed skull base metastases cervical lymph nodes Case-2 received RT/TMZ recurrent involving portacaval lymph nodes patients achieved excellent long-term control sites treated extraneural metastases significant acute delayed toxicity RT/TMZ safely delivered provide sustained control extraneural metastases PC retrospective report limitations RT/TMZ considered therapeutic option management extraneural metastases PC,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[826, 1341, 32, 2052, 1542, 57, 3116, 9, 13, 14, 1, 62, 57, 3, 147, 1, 1341, 16, 90, 23, 3, 463, 1, 196, 29, 8, 2434, 2, 44, 20, 293, 578, 15, 1301, 404, 279, 1341, 16, 1969, 436, 6, 36, 5, 8, 52, 63, 25, 1, 158, 456, 53, 125, 16, 77, 260, 24, 9, 1341, 84, 2725, 1165, 170, 2, 121, 32, 173, 198, 899, 2269, 1676, 74, 23, 3, 119, 1, 1537, 2081, 90, 36, 71, 85, 373, 210, 21, 414, 3, 51, 6, 36, 2, 367, 1, 121, 5, 750, 1537, 240, 2081, 4, 18, 780, 7, 5, 2447, 2193, 1341, 2, 16431, 196, 110, 7, 42, 324, 532, 1, 27905, 28, 3, 98, 1, 147, 1, 1341, 2311, 598, 10, 259, 18, 2, 79, 5, 109, 624, 1029, 4, 104, 473, 113, 633, 159, 263, 502, 2, 473, 14, 103, 240, 2081, 6, 3, 30, 2929, 4, 3, 5054, 1782, 2, 6, 3, 196, 4, 3, 263, 502, 473, 18, 103, 240, 2081, 6, 387, 30, 1267, 46882, 263, 502, 110, 7, 513, 1503, 319, 337, 182, 1, 3, 633, 1, 73, 16431, 196, 5, 77, 93, 286, 15, 1612, 155, 240, 2081, 10, 2268, 1623, 2, 822, 377, 2275, 182, 1, 16431, 196, 4, 1341, 242, 26, 459, 414, 71, 1939, 240, 2081, 122, 40, 515, 22, 8, 189, 1501, 9, 3, 284, 1, 16431, 196, 4, 1341]",1424.0,27106209,Radiotherapy concurrent temozolomide management extraneural metastases pituitary carcinoma,12,0.11320754716981132
Endonasal endoscopic reoperation for residual or recurrent craniopharyngiomas.,Journal of neurosurgery,J. Neurosurg.,2016-05-06,"OBJECTIVE Craniopharyngiomas can be difficult to remove completely based on their intimate relationship with surrounding visual and endocrine structures. Reoperations are not uncommon but have been associated with higher rates of complications and lower extents of resection. So radiation is often offered as an alternative to reoperation. The endonasal endoscopic transsphenoidal approach has been used in recent years for craniopharyngiomas previously removed with craniotomy. The impact of this approach on reoperations has not been widely investigated. METHODS The authors reviewed a prospectively acquired database of endonasal endoscopic resections of craniopharyngiomas over 11 years at Weill Cornell Medical College, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, performed by the senior authors. Reoperations were separated from first operations. Pre- and postoperative visual and endocrine function, tumor size, body mass index (BMI), quality of life (QOL), extent of resection (EOR), impact of prior radiation, and complications were compared between groups. EOR was divided into gross-total resection (GTR, 100%), near-total resection (NTR, > 95%), and subtotal resection (STR, < 95%). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS Of the total 57 endonasal surgical procedures, 22 (39%) were reoperations. First-time operations and reoperations did not differ in tumor volume, radiological configuration, or patients' BMI. Hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus (DI) were more common before reoperations (82% and 55%, respectively) compared with first operations (60% and 8.6%, respectively; p < 0.001). For the 46 patients in whom GTR was intended, rates of GTR and GTR+NTR were not significantly different between first operations (90% and 97%, respectively) and reoperations (80% and 100%, respectively). For reoperations, prior radiation and larger tumor volume had lower rates of GTR. Vision improved equally in first operations (80%) compared with reoperations (73%). New anterior pituitary deficits were more common in first operations compared with reoperations (51% vs 23%, respectively; p = 0.08), while new DI was more common in reoperations compared with first-time operations (80% vs 47%, respectively; p = 0.08). Nonendocrine complications occurred in 2 (3.6%) first-time operations and no reoperations. Tumor regrowth occurred in 6 patients (11%) over a median follow-up of 46 months and was not different between first versus reoperations, but was associated with STR (33%) compared with GTR+NTR (4%; p = 0.02) and with not receiving radiation after STR (67% vs 22%; p = 0.08). The overall BMI increased significantly from 28.7 to 34.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> over 10 years. Six months after surgery, there was a significant improvement in QOL, which was similar between first-time operations and reoperations, and negatively correlated with STR. CONCLUSIONS Endonasal endoscopic transsphenoidal reoperation results in similar EOR, visual outcome, and improvement in QOL as first-time operations, with no significant increase in complications. EOR is more impacted by tumor volume and prior radiation. Reoperations should be offered to patients with recurrent craniopharyngiomas and may be preferable to radiation in patients in whom GTR or NTR can be achieved.",Journal Article,1355.0,32.0,OBJECTIVE

MAPK activation and HRAS mutation identified in pituitary spindle cell oncocytoma.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2016-06-01,"Pituitary spindle cell oncocytoma (SCO) is an uncommon primary pituitary neoplasm that presents with mass effect on adjacent neurovascular structures, similar to non-hormone-producing pituitary adenomas. To determine the molecular etiology of SCO, we performed exome sequencing on four SCO cases, with matched normal controls, to assess somatic mutations and copy number alterations. Our analysis revealed a low mutation rate and a copy-neutral profile, consistent with the low-grade nature of this tumor. However, we identified a co-occurring somatic HRAS (p.Q61R) activating point mutation and MEN1 frameshift mutation (p.L117fs) present in a primary and recurrent tumor from one patient. Other SCOs demonstrated mutations in SND1 and FAT1, which are associated with MAPK pathway activation. Immunohistochemistry across the SCO cohort demonstrated robust MAPK activity in all cases (n=4), as evidenced by strong phospho-ERK staining, while phospho-AKT levels suggested only basal levels of PI3K pathway activation. Taken together, this identifies the MAPK signaling pathway as a novel therapeutic target for spindle cell oncocytoma, which may offer a powerful adjunct for aggressive tumors refractory to surgical resection.",Journal Article,1329.0,11.0,Pituitary spindle oncocytoma SCO uncommon primary pituitary neoplasm presents mass effect adjacent neurovascular structures similar non-hormone-producing pituitary adenomas determine molecular etiology SCO performed exome sequencing SCO cases matched normal controls assess somatic copy number alterations revealed low rate copy-neutral profile consistent low-grade nature identified co-occurring somatic HRAS p.Q61R activating point MEN1 frameshift p.L117fs present primary recurrent patient SCOs demonstrated SND1 FAT1 associated MAPK pathway activation Immunohistochemistry SCO cohort demonstrated robust MAPK activity cases n=4 evidenced strong phospho-ERK staining phospho-AKT levels suggested basal levels PI3K pathway activation Taken identifies MAPK signaling pathway novel therapeutic target spindle oncocytoma offer powerful adjunct aggressive refractory surgical resection,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4052, 31, 12306, 24243, 16, 35, 2052, 86, 2131, 17, 2740, 5, 782, 254, 23, 2086, 9848, 2414, 288, 6, 220, 785, 3787, 2751, 6, 223, 3, 219, 2855, 1, 24243, 21, 173, 2865, 615, 23, 294, 24243, 140, 5, 655, 295, 535, 6, 423, 1119, 138, 2, 1337, 207, 593, 114, 65, 553, 8, 154, 258, 116, 2, 8, 1337, 6338, 800, 925, 5, 3, 154, 88, 2202, 1, 26, 30, 137, 21, 108, 8, 1269, 1821, 1119, 7174, 19, 26371, 1616, 741, 258, 2, 7923, 9425, 258, 19, 68163, 364, 4, 8, 86, 2, 387, 30, 29, 104, 69, 127, 68164, 264, 138, 4, 68165, 2, 13203, 92, 32, 41, 5, 1748, 308, 363, 888, 716, 3, 24243, 180, 264, 1922, 1748, 128, 4, 62, 140, 78, 39, 22, 4728, 20, 1082, 3125, 1819, 1029, 369, 3125, 649, 148, 1148, 158, 2135, 148, 1, 974, 308, 363, 1633, 1162, 26, 2953, 3, 1748, 314, 308, 22, 8, 229, 189, 283, 9, 4052, 31, 12306, 92, 68, 1918, 8, 3757, 5471, 9, 571, 57, 430, 6, 221, 170]",1169.0,27175596,MAPK activation HRAS identified pituitary spindle oncocytoma,0,0.0
Increased expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in human pituitary tumors.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2016-11-01,"Subsets of pituitary tumors exhibit an aggressive clinical courses and recur despite surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Because modulation of the immune response through inhibition of T-cell checkpoints has led to durable clinical responses in multiple malignancies, we explored whether pituitary adenomas express immune-related biomarkers that could suggest suitability for immunotherapy. Specifically, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) has emerged as a potential biomarker whose expression may portend more favorable responses to immune checkpoint blockade therapies. We thus investigated the expression of PD-L1 in pituitary adenomas. PD-L1 RNA and protein expression were evaluated in 48 pituitary tumors, including functioning and non-functioning adenomas as well as atypical and recurrent tumors. Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte populations were also assessed by immunohistochemistry. Pituitary tumors express variable levels of PD-L1 transcript and protein. PD-L1 RNA and protein expression were significantly increased in functioning (growth hormone and prolactin-expressing) pituitary adenomas compared to non-functioning (null cell and silent gonadotroph) adenomas. Moreover, primary pituitary adenomas harbored higher levels of PD-L1 mRNA compared to recurrent tumors. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were observed in all pituitary tumors and were positively correlated with increased PD-L1 expression, particularly in the functional subtypes. Human pituitary adenomas harbor PD-L1 across subtypes, with significantly higher expression in functioning adenomas compared to non-functioning adenomas. This expression is accompanied by the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. These findings suggest the existence of an immune response to pituitary tumors and raise the possibility of considering checkpoint blockade immunotherapy in cases refractory to conventional management.",Journal Article,1176.0,20.0,Subsets pituitary exhibit aggressive clinical courses recur despite surgery radiation chemotherapy modulation immune response inhibition T-cell checkpoints led durable clinical responses multiple malignancies explored pituitary adenomas express immune-related biomarkers suggest suitability immunotherapy Specifically programmed death ligand 1 PD-L1 emerged potential biomarker expression portend favorable responses immune checkpoint blockade therapies investigated expression PD-L1 pituitary adenomas PD-L1 RNA expression evaluated 48 pituitary including functioning non-functioning adenomas atypical recurrent infiltrating lymphocyte populations assessed immunohistochemistry Pituitary express variable levels PD-L1 transcript PD-L1 RNA expression significantly increased functioning growth hormone prolactin-expressing pituitary adenomas compared non-functioning null silent gonadotroph adenomas primary pituitary adenomas harbored higher levels PD-L1 mRNA compared recurrent infiltrating lymphocytes observed pituitary positively correlated increased PD-L1 expression particularly functional subtypes Human pituitary adenomas harbor PD-L1 subtypes significantly higher expression functioning adenomas compared non-functioning adenomas expression accompanied presence infiltrating lymphocytes findings suggest existence immune response pituitary raise possibility considering checkpoint blockade immunotherapy cases refractory conventional management,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1890, 1, 57, 2239, 35, 571, 38, 1993, 2, 5609, 550, 152, 121, 2, 56, 408, 2356, 1, 3, 250, 51, 298, 297, 1, 102, 31, 4704, 71, 836, 6, 1480, 38, 253, 4, 232, 441, 21, 1443, 317, 2751, 1669, 250, 139, 582, 17, 359, 309, 10163, 9, 726, 1225, 1846, 273, 1232, 14, 333, 729, 71, 2054, 22, 8, 174, 901, 1310, 55, 68, 11293, 80, 913, 253, 6, 250, 986, 1189, 235, 21, 631, 565, 3, 55, 1, 333, 729, 4, 2751, 333, 729, 893, 2, 178, 55, 11, 194, 4, 576, 57, 141, 2702, 2, 220, 2702, 2751, 22, 149, 22, 1973, 2, 387, 57, 30, 2097, 1448, 1184, 11, 120, 275, 20, 888, 57, 1669, 1347, 148, 1, 333, 729, 3268, 2, 178, 333, 729, 893, 2, 178, 55, 11, 97, 101, 4, 2702, 129, 785, 2, 10841, 1046, 2751, 72, 6, 220, 2702, 3505, 31, 2, 9890, 69048, 2751, 1393, 86, 2751, 3253, 142, 148, 1, 333, 729, 956, 72, 6, 387, 57, 30, 2097, 1594, 11, 164, 4, 62, 57, 2, 11, 2375, 438, 5, 101, 333, 729, 55, 823, 4, 3, 583, 814, 171, 2751, 2760, 333, 729, 716, 814, 5, 97, 142, 55, 4, 2702, 2751, 72, 6, 220, 2702, 2751, 26, 55, 16, 2756, 20, 3, 463, 1, 30, 2097, 1594, 46, 272, 309, 3, 5335, 1, 35, 250, 51, 6, 57, 2, 5008, 3, 2526, 1, 3075, 986, 1189, 726, 4, 140, 430, 6, 809, 284]",1765.0,27655724,Increased expression programmed death ligand 1 PD-L1 human pituitary,3,0.02830188679245283

Association between dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate and attention in long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with only chemotherapy.,Psychoneuroendocrinology,Psychoneuroendocrinology,2016-11-16,"Long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at risk for neurocognitive impairment, as well as compromised hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function. Dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS) is an adrenal androgen commonly used as a marker of HPA function. In the general population, a low level of DHEAS has been associated with poorer cognition. At ≥2years post-treatment, we examined the association of DHEAS with attention outcomes in 35 male and 34 female long-term survivors of childhood ALL (mean[standard deviation] age at evaluation 14.5[4.7] years; 7.5[1.9] years post-diagnosis) who were treated with only chemotherapy and without prophylactic cranial irradiation. Male survivors with low-normal levels of DHEAS had worse performance than male survivors with high levels of DHEAS on multiple measures of attention (all P's<0.05). However, association between DHEAS and attention measures were not found in female survivors. Our results suggest that survivors of ALL who suffer from partial but persistent adrenal insufficiency may be at risk for neurocognitive deficits. This finding should be validated in a larger prospective study, with attention to sex differences in the potential impact of adrenal insufficiency on neurocognitive outcomes.",Journal Article,1161.0,4.0,Long-term survivors childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk neurocognitive impairment compromised hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal HPA function Dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate DHEAS adrenal androgen commonly marker HPA function general population low level DHEAS associated poorer cognition ≥2years post-treatment examined association DHEAS attention outcomes 35 male 34 female long-term survivors childhood mean standard deviation age evaluation 14.5 4.7 years 7.5 1.9 years post-diagnosis treated chemotherapy prophylactic cranial irradiation Male survivors low-normal levels DHEAS worse performance male survivors high levels DHEAS multiple measures attention P 's 0.05 association DHEAS attention measures female survivors suggest survivors suffer partial persistent adrenal insufficiency risk neurocognitive deficits finding validated larger prospective attention sex differences potential impact adrenal insufficiency neurocognitive outcomes,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[319, 337, 332, 1, 864, 286, 1275, 62, 32, 28, 43, 9, 2958, 2315, 22, 149, 22, 4867, 7531, 12098, 2987, 14513, 343, 12317, 6424, 16919, 16, 35, 2987, 687, 841, 95, 22, 8, 952, 1, 14513, 343, 4, 3, 1083, 266, 8, 154, 301, 1, 16919, 71, 85, 41, 5, 1769, 8130, 28, 69429, 539, 24, 21, 409, 3, 248, 1, 16919, 5, 2111, 123, 4, 465, 1045, 2, 562, 1061, 319, 337, 332, 1, 864, 62, 313, 260, 3348, 89, 28, 451, 213, 33, 39, 67, 60, 67, 33, 14, 83, 60, 539, 147, 54, 11, 73, 5, 158, 56, 2, 187, 1862, 2565, 1104, 1045, 332, 5, 154, 295, 148, 1, 16919, 42, 639, 528, 76, 1045, 332, 5, 64, 148, 1, 16919, 23, 232, 1018, 1, 2111, 62, 19, 292, 13, 474, 137, 248, 59, 16919, 2, 2111, 1018, 11, 44, 204, 4, 1061, 332, 114, 99, 309, 17, 332, 1, 62, 54, 6506, 29, 450, 84, 1882, 2987, 4360, 68, 40, 28, 43, 9, 2958, 2752, 26, 1567, 257, 40, 938, 4, 8, 1077, 482, 45, 5, 2111, 6, 1035, 362, 4, 3, 174, 345, 1, 2987, 4360, 23, 2958, 123]",1250.0,27907849,Association dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate attention long-term survivors childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated chemotherapy,0,0.0
Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis Dysfunction in Survivors of Childhood CNS Tumors: Importance of Systematic Follow-Up and Early Endocrine Consultation.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-10-31,"The Oncology Grand Rounds series is designed to place original reports published in the Journal into clinical context. A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of the relevant literature, and a summary of the authors' suggested management approaches. The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published in Journal of Clinical Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice. An 11-year-old male with a history of metastatic tectal plate low-grade glioma who was diagnosed at age 2.8 years transferred his care to the long-term follow-up clinic. He completed treatment with multiagent chemotherapy-carboplatin, vincristine, temozolomide, procarbazine, lomustine, and thioguanine-at age 4.5 years and did not require radiotherapy. At primary diagnosis, he presented with hydrocephalus that required ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement, with a subsequent shunt revision at age 6 years. Residual metastatic tumors in the third and fourth ventricles and in the suprasellar region remained stable for more than 5 years. The patient achieved normal developmental milestones and was not taking medications. He was offered screening for hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) dysfunction because of his suprasellar lesion. His height was at the 25th percentile for chronological age, with decline from the 50th percentile noted during the preceding 18 months ( Fig 1 , point c). Pubertal stage was Tanner 4 for pubic hair and penile size, which contrasted with small testes (4.5 mL). Pubic hair and voice changes were noticed 2 to 3 years before this visit. Plasma testosterone level was consistent with Tanner 4 (255 ng/dL = 8.9 nmol/L). An x-ray of the left hand revealed a notably advanced bone age of 15.5 years.

"New outlook on the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of childhood-onset craniopharyngioma.",Nature reviews. Endocrinology,Nat Rev Endocrinol,2017-02-03,"Childhood-onset craniopharyngiomas are rare embryonic tumours of low-grade histological malignancy. Novel insights into the molecular pathogenesis of human adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma have started to unveil the possibility of testing novel treatments targeting pathogenic pathways. Hypothalamic involvement and/or treatment-related lesions result in impaired physical and social functionality and in severe neuroendocrine sequelae. Quality of survival in patients with craniopharyngioma with hypothalamic involvement is impaired by severe obesity, physical fatigue and non-optimal psychosocial development. Patients with craniopharyngioma involving hypothalamic structures have reduced 20-year overall survival, but overall and progression-free survival are not related to the degree of surgical resection. Irradiation is effective in the prevention of tumour progression and recurrence. For favourably localized craniopharyngiomas, the preferred treatment of choice is to attempt complete resection with preservation of visual, hypothalamic and pituitary function. For unfavourably localized tumours in close proximity to optic and/or hypothalamic structures, a radical neurosurgical strategy attempting complete resection is not recommended owing to potential severe sequelae. As expertise has been shown to have an impact on post-treatment morbidity, medical societies should establish criteria for adequate professional expertise for the treatment of craniopharyngioma. On the basis of these criteria, health authorities should organize the certification of centres of excellence that are authorized to treat and care for patients with this chronic disease.",Journal Article,1082.0,32.0,Childhood-onset craniopharyngiomas rare embryonic tumours low-grade histological malignancy Novel insights molecular pathogenesis human adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma started unveil possibility testing novel treatments targeting pathogenic pathways Hypothalamic involvement and/or treatment-related lesions impaired physical social functionality severe neuroendocrine sequelae Quality survival patients craniopharyngioma hypothalamic involvement impaired severe obesity physical fatigue non-optimal psychosocial development Patients craniopharyngioma involving hypothalamic structures reduced 20-year overall survival overall progression-free survival related degree surgical resection Irradiation effective prevention tumour progression recurrence favourably localized craniopharyngiomas preferred treatment choice attempt complete resection preservation visual hypothalamic pituitary function unfavourably localized tumours close proximity optic and/or hypothalamic structures radical neurosurgical strategy attempting complete resection recommended owing potential severe sequelae expertise shown impact post-treatment morbidity medical societies establish criteria adequate professional expertise treatment craniopharyngioma basis criteria health authorities organize certification centres excellence authorized treat care patients chronic disease,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[864, 1707, 10708, 32, 622, 5390, 1319, 1, 154, 88, 1831, 710, 229, 1957, 237, 3, 219, 1384, 1, 171, 22825, 7205, 47, 3461, 6, 16019, 3, 2526, 1, 471, 229, 640, 529, 2806, 460, 7531, 799, 2, 15, 24, 139, 406, 757, 4, 2364, 900, 2, 2032, 8592, 2, 4, 905, 1542, 4156, 372, 1, 25, 4, 7, 5, 7205, 5, 7531, 799, 16, 2364, 20, 905, 1661, 900, 613, 2, 220, 665, 2322, 193, 7, 5, 7205, 1267, 7531, 2414, 47, 405, 179, 111, 63, 25, 84, 63, 2, 91, 115, 25, 32, 44, 139, 6, 3, 1444, 1, 221, 170, 1104, 16, 323, 4, 3, 1070, 1, 770, 91, 2, 146, 9, 20557, 909, 10708, 3, 2514, 24, 1, 1866, 16, 6, 3448, 236, 170, 5, 2224, 1, 3046, 7531, 2, 343, 9, 43351, 909, 1319, 4, 2336, 6167, 6, 5670, 2, 15, 7531, 2414, 8, 711, 10338, 692, 9632, 236, 170, 16, 44, 793, 3421, 6, 174, 905, 4156, 22, 4935, 71, 85, 443, 6, 47, 35, 345, 23, 539, 24, 787, 484, 10600, 257, 1811, 371, 9, 1658, 5341, 4935, 9, 3, 24, 1, 7205, 23, 3, 877, 1, 46, 371, 341, 17637, 257, 30469, 3, 17377, 1, 4496, 1, 11473, 17, 32, 26923, 6, 943, 2, 165, 9, 7, 5, 26, 442, 34]",1641.0,28155902,New outlook diagnosis treatment follow-up childhood-onset craniopharyngioma,0,0.0
Clinical Identification of Oncogenic Drivers and Copy-Number Alterations in Pituitary Tumors.,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,2017-07-01,"Pituitary tumors are the second most common adult primary brain tumor, with a variable clinical course. Recent work has identified a number of genetic determinants of pituitary tumor subtypes, which may augment traditional histopathologic classification schemes. We sought to determine whether pituitary tumors could be stratified based on objective molecular characteristics using a clinical genomics assay. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients operated on at the Brigham and Women's Hospital from 2012 to 2016 whose pituitary tumors were profiled using multiplexed next-generation sequencing. We analyzed 127 pituitary tumors, including 114 adenomas, 5 craniopharyngiomas, and 8 tumors of other histologies. We observed recurrent BRAFV600E mutations in papillary craniopharyngiomas, CTNNB1 mutations in adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas, and activating GNAS mutations in growth hormone-secreting adenomas. Furthermore, we validated the presence of two distinct genomic subclasses in adenomas (i.e., those with disrupted or quiet copy-number profiles) and the significant association of disruption with functional hormone status (P < 0.05). We report the clinical implementation of next-generation sequencing of pituitary tumors. We confirmed previously identified molecular subclasses for these tumors and show that routine screening as part of clinical practice is both feasible and informative. This large-scale proof-of-principle study may help to guide future institutional efforts for pituitary tumor classification as well as the incorporation of such techniques into prospective analysis as part of clinical trials.",Journal Article,934.0,14.0,Pituitary second common adult primary brain variable clinical course Recent work identified number genetic determinants pituitary subtypes augment traditional histopathologic classification schemes sought determine pituitary stratified based objective molecular characteristics clinical genomics performed retrospective patients operated Brigham Women 's Hospital 2012 2016 pituitary profiled multiplexed next-generation sequencing 127 pituitary including 114 adenomas 5 craniopharyngiomas 8 histologies observed recurrent BRAFV600E papillary craniopharyngiomas CTNNB1 adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas activating GNAS growth hormone-secreting adenomas Furthermore validated presence distinct genomic subclasses adenomas i.e. disrupted quiet copy-number profiles significant association disruption functional hormone status P 0.05 report clinical implementation next-generation sequencing pituitary confirmed previously identified molecular subclasses routine screening clinical practice feasible informative large-scale proof-of-principle help guide future institutional efforts pituitary classification incorporation techniques prospective clinical trials,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[57, 32, 3, 419, 96, 186, 780, 86, 342, 30, 5, 8, 1347, 38, 906, 435, 1357, 71, 108, 8, 207, 1, 336, 3403, 1, 30, 814, 92, 68, 4369, 1847, 2630, 947, 7103, 21, 990, 6, 223, 317, 57, 359, 40, 1173, 90, 23, 461, 219, 374, 75, 8, 38, 4229, 719, 21, 173, 8, 459, 65, 1, 7, 7297, 23, 28, 3, 10543, 2, 117, 292, 702, 29, 1195, 6, 1390, 1310, 57, 11, 5490, 75, 7734, 1305, 914, 615, 21, 311, 4080, 57, 141, 3803, 2751, 33, 10708, 2, 66, 57, 1, 127, 3489, 21, 164, 387, 9315, 138, 4, 1796, 10708, 4485, 138, 4, 22825, 10708, 2, 1616, 8624, 138, 4, 129, 785, 5052, 2751, 798, 21, 938, 3, 463, 1, 100, 834, 572, 9355, 4, 2751, 70, 563, 135, 5, 5576, 15, 26556, 1337, 207, 1241, 2, 3, 93, 248, 1, 3220, 5, 583, 785, 156, 19, 13, 474, 21, 414, 3, 38, 2393, 1, 1305, 914, 615, 1, 57, 21, 557, 373, 108, 219, 9355, 9, 46, 57, 2, 514, 17, 1311, 453, 22, 760, 1, 38, 758, 16, 110, 1313, 2, 4189, 26, 375, 1124, 3840, 1, 4968, 45, 68, 987, 6, 1597, 508, 1115, 1413, 9, 30, 947, 22, 149, 22, 3, 2838, 1, 225, 1092, 237, 482, 65, 22, 760, 1, 38, 143]",1545.0,28486603,Clinical Identification Oncogenic Drivers Copy-Number Alterations Pituitary,1,0.009433962264150943

Endocrine-related adverse events associated with immune checkpoint blockade and expert insights on their management.,Cancer treatment reviews,Cancer Treat. Rev.,2017-06-22,"Agents that modulate immune checkpoint proteins, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1), have become a mainstay in cancer treatment. The clinical benefit afforded by immune checkpoint inhibitors can be accompanied by immune-related adverse events (irAE) that affect the skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and endocrine system. The types of irAEs associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors are generally consistent across tumor types. Immune-related endocrine events can affect the pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands, as well as other downstream target organs. These events are unique when compared with other irAEs because the manifestations are often irreversible. Immune-related endocrine events are typically grade 1/2 in severity and often present with non-specific symptoms, making them difficult to diagnose.

Molecular Analyses Reveal Inflammatory Mediators in the Solid Component and Cyst Fluid of Human Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma.,Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology,J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol.,2017-09-01,"Pediatric adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma (ACP) is a highly solid and cystic tumor, often causing substantial damage to critical neuroendocrine structures such as the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and optic apparatus. Paracrine signaling mechanisms driving tumor behavior have been hypothesized, with IL-6R overexpression identified as a potential therapeutic target. To identify potential novel therapies, we characterized inflammatory and immunomodulatory factors in ACP cyst fluid and solid tumor components. Cytometric bead analysis revealed a highly pro-inflammatory cytokine pattern in fluid from ACP compared to fluids from another cystic pediatric brain tumor, pilocytic astrocytoma. Cytokines and chemokines with particularly elevated concentrations in ACPs were IL-6, CXCL1 (GRO), CXCL8 (IL-8) and the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. These data were concordant with solid tumor compartment transcriptomic data from a larger cohort of ACPs, other pediatric brain tumors and normal brain. The majority of receptors for these cytokines and chemokines were also over-expressed in ACPs. In addition to IL-10, the established immunosuppressive factor IDO-1 was overexpressed by ACPs at the mRNA and protein levels. These data indicate that ACP cyst fluids and solid tumor components are characterized by an inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression pattern.

Here we show that the cell type-restricted thyroid hormone receptor isoform TRβ2 sensitizes to <i>RB1</i> loss in both settings by antagonizing the widely expressed and tumor-suppressive TRβ1. TRβ2 promoted expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SKP2, a critical factor for <i>RB1</i>-mutant tumors, by enabling EMI1/FBXO5-dependent inhibition of SKP2 degradation. In <i>RB1</i> wild-type neuroblastoma cells, endogenous Rb or ectopic TRβ2 was required to sustain SKP2 expression as well as cell viability and proliferation. These results suggest that in certain contexts, Rb loss enables TRβ1-dependent suppression of SKP2 as a safeguard against <i>RB1</i>-deficient tumorigenesis.

Suprasellar and recurrent pediatric craniopharyngiomas: expanding indications for the extended endoscopic transsphenoidal approach.,Journal of neurosurgery. Pediatrics,J Neurosurg Pediatr,2017-11-10,"OBJECTIVE The expanded endonasal endoscopic transsphenoidal approach has become increasingly used for craniopharyngioma surgery in the pediatric population, but questions still persist regarding its utility in younger children, in recurrent and irradiated tumors, and in masses primarily located in the suprasellar region. The narrow corridor, incomplete pneumatization, and fear of hypothalamic injury have traditionally relegated this approach to application in older children with mostly cystic craniopharyngiomas centered in the sella. The authors present a series of consecutive pediatric patients in whom the endonasal endoscopic approach was used to remove craniopharyngiomas from patients of varied ages, regardless of the location of the tumor and previous treatments or surgeries, to ascertain if the traditional concerns about limitations of this approach are worth reevaluating METHODS Eleven consecutive pediatric patients (age ≤ 18 years) underwent surgery via an endoscopic transsphenoidal approach at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center from 2007 to 2016. The authors recorded the location, consistency, and size of the lesion, assessed for hypothalamic invasion radiographically, calculated skull base measurements, and assessed parameters such as extent of resection, visual function, endocrinological function, weight gain, and return-to-school status. RESULTS The average age at the time of surgery was 7.9 years (range 4-17 years) and the tumor sizes ranged from 1.3 to 41.7 cm<sup>3</sup>. Five cases were purely suprasellar, 5 had solid components, 4 were reoperations, and 5 had a conchal sphenoid aeration. Nevertheless, gross-total resection was achieved in 45% of the patients and 50% of those in whom it was the goal of surgery, without any correlation with the location, tumor consistency, or the age of the patient. Near-total resection, subtotal resection, or biopsy was performed intentionally in the remaining patients to avoid hypothalamic injury. Anterior pituitary dysfunction occurred in 81.8% of the patients, and 63.3% developed diabetes insipidus . Two patients (18%) had a greater than 9% increase in body mass index. Visual function was stable or improved in 73%. All children returned to an academic environment, with 10 of them in the grade appropriate for their age. There was a single case of each of the following: CSF leak, loss of vision unilaterally, and abscess. CONCLUSIONS The endoscopic transsphenoidal approach is suitable for removing pediatric craniopharyngiomas even in young children with suprasellar tumors, conchal sphenoid sinus, recurrent tumors, and tumors with solid components. The extent of resection is dictated by intrinsic hypothalamic tumor invasiveness rather than the approach. The endoscopic transsphenoidal approach affords the ability to directly inspect the hypothalamus to determine invasion, which may help spare the patient from hypothalamic injury. Irrespective of approach, the rates of postoperative endocrinopathy remain high and the learning curve for the approach to a relatively rare tumor is steep.",Journal Article,802.0,17.0,OBJECTIVE expanded endonasal endoscopic transsphenoidal approach increasingly craniopharyngioma surgery pediatric population questions persist utility younger children recurrent irradiated masses primarily located suprasellar region narrow corridor incomplete pneumatization fear hypothalamic injury traditionally relegated approach application older children cystic craniopharyngiomas centered sella authors present series consecutive pediatric patients endonasal endoscopic approach remove craniopharyngiomas patients varied ages regardless location previous treatments surgeries ascertain traditional concerns limitations approach worth reevaluating METHODS consecutive pediatric patients age ≤ 18 years underwent surgery endoscopic transsphenoidal approach NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center 2007 2016 authors recorded location consistency size lesion assessed hypothalamic invasion radiographically calculated skull base measurements assessed parameters extent resection visual function endocrinological function weight gain return-to-school status average age time surgery 7.9 years range 4-17 years sizes ranged 1.3 41.7 cm sup 3 /sup cases purely suprasellar 5 solid components 4 reoperations 5 conchal sphenoid aeration gross-total resection achieved 45 patients 50 goal surgery correlation location consistency age patient Near-total resection subtotal resection biopsy performed intentionally remaining patients avoid hypothalamic injury Anterior pituitary dysfunction occurred 81.8 patients 63.3 developed diabetes insipidus patients 18 greater 9 increase body mass index Visual function stable improved 73 children returned academic environment 10 grade appropriate age single case following CSF leak loss vision unilaterally abscess CONCLUSIONS endoscopic transsphenoidal approach suitable removing pediatric craniopharyngiomas young children suprasellar conchal sphenoid sinus recurrent solid components extent resection dictated intrinsic hypothalamic invasiveness approach endoscopic transsphenoidal approach affords ability directly inspect hypothalamus determine invasion help spare patient hypothalamic injury Irrespective approach rates postoperative endocrinopathy remain high learning curve approach relatively rare steep,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[461, 3, 2064, 18636, 2056, 14214, 353, 71, 1417, 1635, 95, 9, 7205, 152, 4, 3, 815, 266, 84, 1937, 1234, 5589, 666, 211, 1207, 4, 773, 541, 4, 387, 2, 2398, 57, 2, 4, 2692, 1561, 2308, 4, 3, 13122, 1053, 3, 6958, 50684, 2610, 71530, 2, 6443, 1, 7531, 2730, 47, 4206, 30600, 26, 353, 6, 1581, 4, 434, 541, 5, 2754, 2965, 10708, 4846, 4, 3, 22175, 3, 738, 364, 8, 988, 1, 935, 815, 7, 4, 953, 3, 18636, 2056, 353, 10, 95, 6, 7930, 10708, 29, 7, 1, 2051, 2165, 1583, 1, 3, 1147, 1, 3, 30, 2, 698, 640, 15, 5305, 6, 6040, 492, 3, 1847, 2061, 545, 1939, 1, 26, 353, 32, 9498, 34090, 636, 2627, 935, 815, 7, 89, 1552, 203, 60, 208, 152, 847, 35, 2056, 14214, 353, 28, 37546, 21110, 20587, 19143, 484, 574, 29, 1307, 6, 1390, 3, 738, 1872, 3, 1147, 5358, 2, 444, 1, 3, 1180, 275, 9, 7531, 578, 5770, 981, 5054, 1782, 1685, 2, 275, 1038, 225, 22, 1039, 1, 170, 3046, 343, 28148, 343, 924, 1803, 2, 4656, 6, 5953, 156, 99, 3, 1011, 89, 28, 3, 98, 1, 152, 10, 67, 83, 60, 184, 39, 269, 60, 2, 3, 30, 4131, 1869, 29, 14, 27, 6, 605, 67, 494, 172, 27, 172, 365, 140, 11, 13033, 13122, 33, 42, 537, 1628, 39, 11, 10691, 2, 33, 42, 8, 50685, 18779, 71531, 3873, 1789, 181, 170, 10, 513, 4, 512, 1, 3, 7, 2, 212, 1, 135, 4, 953, 192, 10, 3, 1326, 1, 152, 187, 500, 816, 5, 3, 1147, 30, 5358, 15, 3, 89, 1, 3, 69, 1829, 181, 170, 5503, 170, 15, 411, 10, 173, 28644, 4, 3, 1844, 7, 6, 3085, 7531, 2730, 2882, 1527, 489, 4, 865, 66, 1, 3, 7, 2, 676, 27, 276, 1978, 16366, 100, 7, 203, 42, 8, 378, 76, 83, 344, 4, 642, 782, 558, 3046, 343, 10, 585, 15, 231, 4, 803, 62, 541, 5157, 6, 35, 1916, 3087, 5, 79, 1, 1370, 4, 3, 88, 870, 9, 136, 89, 125, 10, 8, 226, 473, 1, 296, 1, 3, 366, 1211, 4238, 407, 1, 5859, 20593, 2, 7979, 2130, 3, 2056, 14214, 353, 16, 2884, 9, 9026, 815, 10708, 871, 4, 1169, 541, 5, 13122, 57, 50685, 18779, 5810, 387, 57, 2, 57, 5, 537, 1628, 3, 1039, 1, 170, 16, 10575, 20, 2354, 7531, 30, 3807, 1832, 76, 3, 353, 3, 2056, 14214, 353, 13485, 3, 801, 6, 1606, 39962, 3, 12717, 6, 223, 578, 92, 68, 987, 8539, 3, 69, 29, 7531, 2730, 3500, 1, 353, 3, 151, 1, 573, 13011, 918, 64, 2, 3, 3434, 1496, 9, 3, 353, 6, 8, 1352, 622, 30, 16, 17786]",3023.0,29125446,Suprasellar recurrent pediatric craniopharyngiomas expanding indications extended endoscopic transsphenoidal approach,0,0.0
Ectopic Prolactinoma Presenting as Bacterial Meningitis: A Diagnostic Conundrum.,World neurosurgery,World Neurosurg,2018-01-31,"Prolactinomas may rarely present with meningitis and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea secondary to erosion of the wall of the sella turcica. It is even more uncommon for this abnormal communication to be caused by an ectopic prolactinoma arising from the sphenoid sinus and eroding into the sella. This atypical growth pattern makes diagnosis very difficult because there may be no displacement of the normal pituitary gland. The first reported case of a patient with an ectopic prolactinoma originating within the sphenoid sinus presenting primarily with meningitis is presented, and the management strategy and surgical and nonsurgical treatment options are discussed. A 48-year-old woman presented with confusion, low-pressure headache, and fever. A lumbar puncture revealed Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis, and she was placed on intravenous penicillin G. After initiation of antibiotics, she noticed salty tasting postnasal fluid leakage. Imaging was remarkable for bony erosion of the sphenoid sinus wall by a soft tissue mass growing from within the sinus, with no disruption of the normal pituitary gland. A biopsy was then performed with an endoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal approach, and the CSF leak was repaired with a pedicled nasoseptal flap.

"Repeat stereotactic radiosurgery for Cushing's disease: outcomes of an international, multicenter study.",Journal of neuro-oncology,J. Neurooncol.,2018-03-03,"Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is frequently used for Cushing's disease (CD) after failed pituitary surgery. Management of patients with persistent CD after failed SRS is complex, as the alternative therapeutic options harbor significant risks. The outcomes of repeat pituitary radiosurgery, however, have not been described. We sought to determine the outcomes of repeat SRS in patients with CD. We pooled data from five institutions participating in the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation for patients with recurrent or persistent CD ≥ 12 months after initial SRS. Patients were included in the study if they had ≥ 6 months endocrine follow-up after repeat SRS. Twenty patients were included in the study. Repeat single-session SRS was performed 1.3-9.7 years after initial SRS. Median endocrine follow-up was 6.6 years (1.4-19.1 years). Median margin dose was 20 Gy (range 10.8-35 Gy). Endocrine remission after second SRS was noted in 12 patients (60%), with a median time to remission of 6 months (range 2-64 months). Biochemical recurrence occurred in two patients (17%) after initial remission. Overall, the cumulative rates of durable endocrine remission at 5 and 10 years were 47 and 53%, respectively. Two patients (10%) experienced adverse radiation effects, including transient visual loss and permanent diplopia. Repeat SRS achieves lasting biochemical remission in approximately half of patients with CD refractory to both prior microsurgery and SRS.

Surgical therapy, although often the mainstay of treatment for GHPAs, is less effective in aggressive GHPAs due to their invasive and destructive growth patterns, and their proclivity for infrasellar invasion. LncRNAs are important players in cancer development and emerging in various fundamental biological processes. In the present study, qRT-PCR was performed to examine the expression of lncRNA H19 and MALAT-1 in invasive and non-invasive GHPAs. Our results revealed that the expression of lncRNA H19 was remarkably higher in invasive GHPAs, however, there was no significant differences between the expression of lncRNA MALAT-1 in invasive GHPAs and non-invasive GHPAs, suggesting that lncRNA H19 may play an important role in GHPA invasion.

This was a retrospective review of 97 patients having single-fraction SRS from 2007 until 2014. Eligible patients had no history of prior radiation, normal age- and sex-specific pituitary function before SRS, and at least 24 months of endocrine follow-up. Forty patients (41%) had hormone-secreting tumors; 57 patients had nonsecreting tumors (59%). The median prescription isodose volume was 2.8 cm<sup>3</sup> (interquartile range [IQR], 1.3-4.7); the median tumor margin dose was 20 Gy (IQR, 15-25 Gy). The median follow-up after SRS was 48 months (IQR, 34-68 months). Twenty-seven patients (28%) developed pituitary insufficiency at a median of 22 months (IQR, 12-36 months) after SRS.

Hypothyroidism after Radiation Therapy for Childhood Cancer: A Report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,Radiation research,Radiat. Res.,2018-05-15,"While thyroid cancer risks from exposure to ionizing radiation early in life are well characterized quantitatively, the association of radiation with nonmalignant, functional thyroid disorders has been less studied. Here, we report on a risk analysis study of hypothyroidism with radiation dose to the thyroid gland and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis among survivors of childhood cancer. Utilizing data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, a cohort of 14,364 five-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed at 26 hospitals in the U.S. and Canada between 1970 and 1986 and followed through 2009, the occurrence of hypothyroidism was ascertained among 12,015 survivors through serial questionnaires. Radiation doses to the thyroid gland and pituitary gland were estimated from radiotherapy records. Binary outcome regression was used to estimate prevalence odds ratios for hypothyroidism at five years from diagnosis of childhood cancer and Poisson regression to model incidence rate ratios (RR) after the first five years. A total of 1,193 cases of hypothyroidism were observed, 777 (65%) of which occurred five or more years after cancer diagnosis. The cumulative proportion affected with hypothyroidism (prevalence at five years after cancer diagnosis plus incidence through 30 years after cancer diagnosis) was highest among five-year survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma (32.3%; 95% CI: 29.5-34.9) and cancers of the central nervous system (17.7%; 95% CI: 15.2-20.4). The incidence rate was significantly associated with radiation dose to the thyroid and pituitary. The joint association of hypothyroidism with thyroid and pituitary dose was sub-additive for pituitary doses greater than 16 Gy. In particular, a very strong thyroid radiation dose dependence at low-to-moderate pituitary/hypothalamic doses was diminished at high pituitary doses. Radiation-related risks were higher in males than females and inversely associated with age at exposure and time since exposure but remained elevated more than 25 years after exposure. Our findings indicated that hypothyroidism was significantly associated with treatment with bleomycin (RR = 3.4; 95% CI: 1.6-7.3) and the alkylating agents cyclohexyl-chloroethyl-nitrosourea (CCNU) (RR = 3.0; 95% CI: 1.5-5.3) and cyclophosphamide (RR = 1.3; 95% CI: 1.0-1.8), with a significant dose response for CCNU ( P < 0.01). The risk of hypothyroidism among childhood cancer survivors treated with radiation depends both on direct, dose-dependent radiation-induced damage to the thyroid gland and on dose-dependent indirect effects secondary to irradiation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The dose-response relationship for each site depends on dose to the other. Radiation-related risk persists for more than 25 years after treatment.

"Improving Male Reproductive Health After Childhood, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancer: Progress and Future Directions for Survivorship Research.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2018-06-06,"Reproductive health is a common concern and often a source of distress for male childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer survivors. Clinical and epidemiologic research in survivor populations has identified alkylating agent chemotherapy, testicular radiation, and surgery or radiation to the genitourinary organs, lower spine, or the hypothalamic-pituitary region as risk factors for adverse reproductive outcomes, including impaired spermatogenesis, testosterone insufficiency, and sexual dysfunction. Much of the research on male survivors has focused on the outcome of fertility, using spermatogenesis, serum gonadotropins, and paternity as the measures. However, these studies often fail to account for the clinically relevant but difficult-to-quantify aspects of fertility such as sexual function, cancer-related delayed psychosocial development, medical comorbidities, and socioeconomic concerns. Clinical and basic science research has made significant contributions to improving reproductive outcomes for survivors, with recent advancements in the areas of fertility preservation, clinical assessment of reproductive function, and treatment of adverse reproductive outcomes. Furthermore, there is an emerging qualitative literature addressing the psychosexual aspects of male reproductive health, the clinical application of which will improve quality of life for survivors. This review summarizes the current survivorship literature on reproductive health outcomes for male survivors, including the epidemiology of impaired spermatogenesis, testosterone insufficiency, and sexual dysfunction; clinical and laboratory assessment of reproductive function; and established and investigational interventions to preserve reproductive function for patients newly diagnosed and survivors. Although survivorship research has made significant contributions to improving reproductive outcomes, additional scientific progress is needed in the areas of fertility preservation, risk assessment, and psychosexual support with the aim of optimizing reproductive health for current and future survivors.",Journal Article,594.0,7.0,Reproductive health common concern source distress male childhood adolescent young adult survivors Clinical epidemiologic research survivor populations identified alkylating agent chemotherapy testicular radiation surgery radiation genitourinary organs lower spine hypothalamic-pituitary region risk factors adverse reproductive outcomes including impaired spermatogenesis testosterone insufficiency sexual dysfunction research male survivors focused outcome fertility spermatogenesis serum gonadotropins paternity measures studies fail account clinically relevant difficult-to-quantify aspects fertility sexual function cancer-related delayed psychosocial development medical comorbidities socioeconomic concerns Clinical basic science research significant contributions improving reproductive outcomes survivors recent advancements areas fertility preservation clinical assessment reproductive function treatment adverse reproductive outcomes Furthermore emerging qualitative literature addressing psychosexual aspects male reproductive health clinical application improve quality life survivors review summarizes current survivorship literature reproductive health outcomes male survivors including epidemiology impaired spermatogenesis testosterone insufficiency sexual dysfunction clinical laboratory assessment reproductive function established investigational interventions preserve reproductive function patients newly diagnosed survivors survivorship research significant contributions improving reproductive outcomes additional scientific progress needed areas fertility preservation risk assessment psychosexual support aim optimizing reproductive health current future survivors,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3705, 341, 16, 8, 186, 2893, 2, 629, 8, 2353, 1, 1462, 9, 1045, 864, 3678, 2, 1169, 780, 12, 332, 38, 2, 3609, 389, 4, 2628, 1184, 71, 108, 3410, 420, 56, 121, 2, 152, 15, 121, 6, 3, 4109, 2285, 280, 2342, 15, 3, 7531, 12098, 1053, 22, 43, 130, 9, 290, 3705, 123, 141, 2364, 24713, 2660, 4360, 2, 2232, 1527, 1802, 1, 3, 389, 23, 1045, 332, 71, 1649, 23, 3, 228, 1, 2954, 75, 24713, 524, 34749, 2, 47160, 22, 3, 1018, 137, 46, 94, 629, 4373, 6, 1967, 9, 3, 505, 867, 84, 1740, 6, 3091, 2695, 1, 2954, 225, 22, 2232, 343, 12, 139, 1612, 2322, 193, 484, 1909, 2, 3331, 2061, 38, 2, 2795, 3797, 389, 71, 1229, 93, 5621, 6, 1673, 3705, 123, 9, 332, 5, 435, 6217, 4, 3, 1361, 1, 2954, 2224, 38, 455, 1, 3705, 343, 2, 24, 1, 290, 3705, 123, 798, 125, 16, 35, 1478, 3926, 789, 3432, 3, 28131, 2695, 1, 1045, 3705, 341, 3, 38, 1581, 1, 92, 303, 401, 372, 1, 358, 9, 332, 26, 206, 2869, 3, 291, 2560, 789, 23, 3705, 341, 123, 9, 1045, 332, 141, 3, 1284, 1, 2364, 24713, 2660, 4360, 2, 2232, 1527, 38, 2, 1624, 455, 1, 3705, 343, 2, 635, 2, 3093, 1151, 6, 6783, 3705, 343, 9, 7, 732, 265, 2, 332, 242, 2560, 389, 71, 1229, 93, 5621, 6, 1673, 3705, 123, 402, 3138, 1466, 16, 575, 4, 3, 1361, 1, 2954, 2224, 43, 455, 2, 28131, 538, 5, 3, 1130, 1, 4336, 3705, 341, 9, 291, 2, 508, 332]",2053.0,29874140,Improving Male Reproductive Health Childhood Adolescent Young Adult Progress Future Directions Survivorship Research,0,0.0

Earlier, it was thought to arise from the folliculostellate cells of adenohypophysis.

Hyperthyroidism After Radiation Therapy for Childhood Cancer: A Report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2019-02-12,"The association of hyperthyroidism with exposure to ionizing radiation is poorly understood. This study addresses the risk of hyperthyroidism in relation to incidental therapeutic radiation dose to the thyroid and pituitary glands in a large cohort of survivors of childhood cancer. Using the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study's cohort of 5-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed at hospitals in the United States and Canada between 1970 and 1986, the occurrence of hyperthyroidism through 2009 was ascertained among 12,183 survivors who responded to serial questionnaires. Radiation doses to the thyroid and pituitary glands were estimated from radiation therapy records, and chemotherapy exposures were abstracted from medical records. Binary outcome regression was used to estimate prevalence odds ratios (ORs) for hyperthyroidism at 5 years from diagnosis of childhood cancer and Poisson regression to estimate incidence rate ratios (RRs) after the first 5 years. Survivors reported 179 cases of hyperthyroidism, of which 148 were diagnosed 5 or more years after their cancer diagnosis. The cumulative proportion of survivors diagnosed with hyperthyroidism by 30 years after the cancer diagnosis was 2.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0%-2.9%) among those who received radiation therapy. A linear relation adequately described the thyroid radiation dose response for prevalence of self-reported hyperthyroidism 5 years after cancer diagnosis (excess OR/Gy, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.06-0.95) and incidence rate thereafter (excess RR/Gy, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.03-0.14) over the dose range of 0 to 63 Gy. Neither radiation dose to the pituitary gland nor chemotherapy was associated significantly with hyperthyroidism. Radiation-associated risk remained elevated >25 years after exposure.

Dose-Constraint Model to Predict Neuroendocrine Dysfunction in Young Patients With Brain Tumors: Data From a Prospective Study.,Practical radiation oncology,Pract Radiat Oncol,2019-02-28,"We report on a possible dose-constraint model to predict long-term neuroendocrine dysfunction after cranial irradiation in children and young adults with benign and low-grade brain tumors treated with stereotactic conformal radiation therapy (RT) in a prospective clinical trial. Patients treated with stereotactic conformal RT (54 Gy in 30 fractions) were included for analysis if their co-registered planning computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans were available, along with baseline and post-RT endocrine assessment for at least 2 years. The hypothalamus-pituitary axis (HPA) was contoured on the fused computed tomography-magnetic resonance imaging data set. Worsening of endocrine function was defined biochemically as a new onset endocrine deficit or worsening of preexisting endocrine deficit. Dosimetric indices of HPA, extracted using cumulative dose-volume histograms, were correlated with worsening endocrine function using logistic regression analysis. A total of 51 patients (median age: 13 years; range, 5-25 years) were included. Worsening post-RT endocrine levels were seen in 27 of 51 patients (47%). Growth hormone was the most commonly affected (70%), followed by cortisol (44%), gonadotropin (40%), and thyroxine (7%). The mean of the maximum and minimum doses to HPA was 42.1 Gy and 35.7 Gy, respectively. For patients with worsening endocrine levels, the mean maximum dose to HPA was 46.6 Gy compared with 36.5 Gy in patients with stable functions. The mean minimum dose to HPA was also higher (40.5 Gy vs 29.6 Gy) in patients with endocrine dysfunction. Logistic regression analysis identified the volume of HPA receiving 50% of the prescribed dose as the only statistically significant parameter predicting endocrine dysfunction. A dose of ≥27 Gy to any volume of HPA was associated with a 4-fold increase in risk of endocrine dysfunction (odds ratio: 4.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-15.62; P = .038). Our prospective longitudinal study demonstrates the feasibility of HPA avoidance using modern, high-precision, conformal RT techniques and correlates HPA dosimetry with neuroendocrine dysfunction. We suggest restricting HPA doses to <27 Gy to minimize the risk of post-RT neuroendocrine deficits.",Journal Article,327.0,2.0,report possible dose-constraint model predict long-term neuroendocrine dysfunction cranial irradiation children young adults benign low-grade brain treated stereotactic conformal radiation therapy RT prospective clinical trial Patients treated stereotactic conformal RT 54 Gy 30 fractions included co-registered planning computed tomography magnetic resonance imaging scans available baseline post-RT endocrine assessment 2 years hypothalamus-pituitary axis HPA contoured fused computed tomography-magnetic resonance imaging set Worsening endocrine function defined biochemically new onset endocrine deficit worsening preexisting endocrine deficit Dosimetric indices HPA extracted cumulative dose-volume histograms correlated worsening endocrine function logistic regression total 51 patients median age 13 years range 5-25 years included Worsening post-RT endocrine levels seen 27 51 patients 47 Growth hormone commonly affected 70 followed cortisol 44 gonadotropin 40 thyroxine 7 mean maximum minimum doses HPA 42.1 Gy 35.7 Gy respectively patients worsening endocrine levels mean maximum dose HPA 46.6 Gy compared 36.5 Gy patients stable functions mean minimum dose HPA higher 40.5 Gy vs 29.6 Gy patients endocrine dysfunction Logistic regression identified volume HPA receiving 50 prescribed dose statistically significant parameter predicting endocrine dysfunction dose ≥27 Gy volume HPA associated 4-fold increase risk endocrine dysfunction odds ratio 4.05 95 confidence interval 1.07-15.62 P .038 prospective longitudinal demonstrates feasibility HPA avoidance modern high-precision conformal RT techniques correlates HPA dosimetry neuroendocrine dysfunction suggest restricting HPA doses 27 Gy minimize risk post-RT neuroendocrine deficits,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 414, 23, 8, 899, 61, 11482, 202, 6, 678, 319, 337, 1542, 1527, 50, 2565, 1104, 4, 541, 2, 1169, 857, 5, 1002, 2, 154, 88, 342, 57, 73, 5, 1729, 2972, 121, 36, 240, 4, 8, 482, 38, 160, 7, 73, 5, 1729, 2972, 240, 667, 381, 4, 201, 1550, 11, 159, 9, 65, 492, 136, 1269, 1653, 1349, 1220, 872, 2, 1484, 1535, 270, 1441, 11, 390, 1510, 5, 330, 2, 539, 240, 1293, 455, 9, 28, 506, 18, 60, 3, 12717, 12098, 2310, 14513, 10, 6476, 23, 3, 6263, 1220, 872, 1484, 1535, 270, 74, 916, 4323, 1, 1293, 343, 10, 395, 7944, 22, 8, 217, 1707, 1293, 6819, 15, 4323, 1, 5004, 1293, 6819, 3187, 3824, 1, 14513, 2484, 75, 967, 61, 433, 8638, 11, 438, 5, 4323, 1293, 343, 75, 812, 320, 65, 8, 181, 1, 725, 7, 52, 89, 233, 60, 184, 33, 243, 60, 11, 159, 4323, 539, 240, 1293, 148, 11, 527, 4, 428, 1, 725, 7, 662, 129, 785, 10, 3, 96, 841, 1424, 431, 370, 20, 9572, 584, 6501, 327, 2, 21132, 67, 3, 313, 1, 3, 689, 2, 2499, 415, 6, 14513, 10, 595, 14, 381, 2, 465, 67, 381, 106, 9, 7, 5, 4323, 1293, 148, 3, 313, 689, 61, 6, 14513, 10, 641, 49, 381, 72, 5, 511, 33, 381, 4, 7, 5, 585, 1681, 3, 313, 2499, 61, 6, 14513, 10, 120, 142, 327, 33, 381, 105, 462, 49, 381, 4, 7, 5, 1293, 1527, 812, 320, 65, 108, 3, 433, 1, 14513, 357, 212, 1, 3, 2746, 61, 22, 3, 158, 712, 93, 4219, 1434, 1293, 1527, 8, 61, 1, 25373, 381, 6, 500, 433, 1, 14513, 10, 41, 5, 8, 39, 1116, 344, 4, 43, 1, 1293, 1527, 610, 197, 39, 474, 48, 307, 268, 14, 1615, 167, 744, 19, 5215, 114, 482, 2380, 45, 1902, 3, 1437, 1, 14513, 5863, 75, 2366, 64, 2720, 2972, 240, 1092, 2, 1871, 14513, 4113, 5, 1542, 1527, 21, 309, 9998, 14513, 415, 6, 428, 381, 6, 3241, 3, 43, 1, 539, 240, 1542, 2752]",2180.0,30826479,Dose-Constraint Model Predict Neuroendocrine Dysfunction Young Patients Brain Prospective,2,0.018867924528301886
